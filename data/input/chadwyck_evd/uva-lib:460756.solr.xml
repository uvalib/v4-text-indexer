      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Cloisters of St. John's Church, Beverley. A Tomb and recumbent Statue seen within. Moonlight. Ellisif pacing the Cloisters disturbedly. Bruern bearing after her a sword. Ellisif. Follow me still, thou spectre of this gloom! That shrink'st from light's soft shaft as from a spear; Follow me still with sliding echoless step Round these dim alleys!—Demon shadow thou, Cast by hell's flame gigantic on the wall, O'er my dark thoughts to fling thy murkier nature And shape me out dread doings with thy sword: I understand thy flourishes,—too well! The devil within us never wants a seconder Outside, to tarre him on: follow me still!— [Paces mutely for a time. Yet whither and for what thus stalk we here Over the low-roof'd chambers of the dead, Stepping from grave to grave? Is it to gibber And play the sad ghost?—fright fools?—and be frighted Ourselves at cockcrow?—Why, alas! ne'er rest we Where all are slumbering in heart-still repose? Yea, even the o'er-watch'd lamp shuts his dim eye, And gazes feebly on his shrine no more; The wandering Moon herself sleeps on the battlements; Nought save the wind is up!—Weary of spirit And flesh, yet in our eager wills unworn, We linger, linger still where our hearts lie Buried with those we love!—Ay, there he moulders, Look, if thou canst through blood-thick tears, there lies Thy murder'd lord and mine! Bruern. The truth will out, Oceans upon me could not stifle it! 'Twas Ethelstan, the tiger who now wears This lion's ravin'd crown, 'twas Ethelstan Robb'd him of his more precious life besides! Ellisif. That's well! that's well! mutter that to me still! Breathe like an Evil Genius in mine ear Sharp whispers of revenge!—O Edwin, Edwin, My princely love, my kingly that shouldst be, Stoop'st thou indeed thy blooming cheek so low For vile worms' gluttonous kisses?—is thy beauty Clasp'd—not in these warm, woman's arms—close!—close!— But to Death's bosom in a winding-sheet? O horrible image, dream of my despair, Less horrible than the truth!—I pr'ythee, soldier, Lend me this glaymore— Bruern. Madam— Ellisif (wresting the sword). Fool! I mean not That poor-soul'd piece of heroism, self-slaughter: O no! the miserablest day we live There's many a better thing to do than die!— 'Tis but to press an oath on it with my lips That, as the insidious ivy of the tower, Mantling her deed, amidst embraces brings His proud head to the dust, I'll weave a net Of subtleties around this Upstart's throne, Which strength unseen shall then drag down to earth, And bury him in the ruins! Bruern. Cursed fratricide Done on the rightful heritor of Wessex, By one but half-blood kinsman to a king! What gave he the liege lord of all the land, Edwin, his true-born elder?—What, forsooth? A boat!—grown green with tufted rottenness, (So rank that very toadstools sprouted from it!) And then—his choice of the sea-rocks! For a crew My single self!—Thus he, and all thy fortunes Waiting thee as his Queen, were wreck'd and lost; The while this wolf's whelp by a shepherd's daughter— At best, her base-begotten by King Edward— Jumping on our legitimate Edwin's throne, Sits now, from Dover Cliff to Dunbar Crags, Despot o'er Dane-lagh and all Angle-land! Ellisif. A potent conqueror he has been; I grant it; The winged serpent has flown far and wide Over our Isle,—the Dragon Flag of Wessex. Bruern. It was his inward serpent stung him on; He strove to stun it in the din of arms,— Drown it amid the bloody waves of fight,— Outride it on the whirlwind of his rage 'Gainst Pict, Scot, Cumbrian, Welsh-kin,—oftener still, With semblance sly of patriotism, to gull His soft-brain'd Saxons,—'gainst our Danish Host, Us whom they call, in hate superlative, The ‘Loathed Ones!’—But to his heart it sticks And will not be flung off, good serpent-leech! That draws him pale, and for the blood pours in As much slow poison— Ellisif. Psha!—Where sits he now? I have been long a stranger to this land. Bruern. Two rivers' length off, at King's Town on Thames: So prate our monks, boasting how he, great buzzard! Airs him upon the monarch-making Rock Of Coronation call'd, most eagle-like, Which none, except of the right golden brood, Should come shot-near, unslain, were I at hand! Ellisif. And my bird-royal stretch'd beneath yon stone!— Come on, come on, tell me that tale again, His death's sad story; I would have my heart Swim ever in the gall of bitterest tears: Come with thy drowning-voice, as when his waves Humber roll'd o'er thee, and thy struggling throat Disgorged the flood with deep groans, sobs, and sighs, Faint mockery of the horrid gurgle round thee: Again I say, murmur it to mine ear, Ring me his watery knell! Bruern. Hark!— Ellisif. What? Bruern. Heard'st nothing?— Ellisif. Nought but the wind-swept grass upon the green Mix its soft waves in sighs. Bruern. Fear hath fine ears: I must to sanctuary! [Exit into the church. Ellisif. Get thee gone. Ha?—No!—Yea, 'tis the regal trump that sounds, Baffling the night breeze with its stronger breath, And now bursts clear above it. [A clarion without. Ethelstan! What brings the flickering bat by night to nestle Amidst these hooded crows of the monastery? Near our white dove-cote too?—His Abbess-Sister! Whom the frail bond of a common bastardy Holds close unto his heart! Is there none else Who draws him hither with a silkener tie, Yet far more strong?—Yea, strong enough to shackle him, If she can wind it round him cunningly,— Insensibly!—for the cables he feels on him Are cobwebs to his strength, they burst about him As frozen spray doth off the whale aroused, While with a lash he looses him!—Let me think: Hum—to work safe, the how, the who, the when?— That gaol-bird in the Choir has but one tune, Murder, still Murder; every churl's redress For every wrong,—plain knocking on the head,— Last reason of your clowns as well as kings. No! death is but fit fate for beasts and boors Who harm us; Ethelstan despises that; He must pay bitterer penalties,—the bitterest, To serve the inflicter!—I'm no dagger'd ruffianess, Blind-staring at one visionary breast, Nor glancing at the Avenger who, as fell, Strides after her with an axe!—He shall obtain His death—when he hath earn'd it; then perchance My lord's bluff vassal may strike in!—I need Forwarders now far nobler than this man Of but one virtue—blind fidelity! I've sounded the smooth Prior—there's some depth;— Thane Alger too, my father's secret friend, Ethelstan's closer foe;—perchance young Edmund? A good soft clay!—This king hath one besides, Whose white arm o'er him pours his rainbow wine, And on her harp, the golden loom of song, Weaves him the tissewy rhyme: will she be with us? If still herself, his Bond-Maiden scarce loves him: No! no! there is an inner ball of fire Gleams from the darkness of her eye, by times When she looks on him, that has lightning in it! Yet is she wilful, and wild temperatures Are warm in gratitude for good bestow'd, (He's kind to Song!) as in their ire for ill: Let it be so—'tis somewhat at the worst: And then the Dane beside, and wily Scot— Ay, it will do—it must!—But here's a stumble— No matter!—My brain too is at the loom, And crossing webs grow ravell'd—I'll to cell, And there dispose them right: dark thoughts are seen Best in the dark!—Sweet Lady Moon, I pray, Whose brightness now walks down the chapel'd aisle, Kiss my lord's tomb for me!—Edwin, my mission! [Exit. SCENE II. Ante-room in St. John's Monastery. House-carls of the Bodyguard. Enter Edgitha. Edgitha. Where is the king, good friend? House-carl. Madam, disarming. Edgitha. Tell him I wait.— [Exit House-carl. Uncall'd for am I here, But not unwish'd for, as my own heart tells me, Which ever beat with his when we as children Sat breast to breast; and now must his like mine Leap to this meeting. My dame nurse would tell How when we lay, cherry-close, in the cradle, Our arms around each other's neck, we smiled Always together; and when one did cry The other wept in ignorant sympathy, Having no cause but its companion's pain, Which 'twould console with all its art, by kisses, And babyish surrender of its toys Into the other's bosom to possess them Until it smiled again! House-carl (re-entering). Madam, this way. [Exeunt. Scene changes to a small Cabinet. Ethelstan in sackcloth, at an oaken table. Enter Edgitha. Ethelstan. My sister! my born friend! [Embracing her. Why at this hour, When none save Night's rough minions venture forth, Was thy pale health so bold? Edgitha. Is there no flush Bespreads my cheek?—that's health! new life, my brother! Which joy to see thee brings. But out, alas! What change in thee, what mournful change? Ethelstan. Years! years! Edgitha. Nay thou'rt, if not in bloomiest youth's springtide, Yet in its autumn. Ethelstan. Autumn is ever sere! Youth saddens near its ending, like Old Age;— Or worse,—for this hath better life at hand. Edgitha. No! no! that is not it—that is not it! Ethelstan. And then bethink thee, Sihtric's widow-queen, Kings wear not, like the peacocks, feather crowns; Our goldenest have some iron in them too! Edgitha. Ah! wouldst thou take meek sample from so many Of our wise Saxon kings; who gave up power Without a sigh to those who still sigh'd for it; And changed their glittering robes with russet weeds, And turn'd their sceptres into crucifixes, And bared their heads of all but tonsured crowns, And lived out hermit lives in mossy cells, Or died at Rome on saintly pilgrimage: Were they not wise? Ethelstan. Wise for themselves they were! Edgitha. Then wherefore not thou for thyself as well? Wherefore, in thy loved town of Beverley, Under thy patron saint, canonized John, As servant dedicate through him to heaven, Seek not thy temporal rest and peace eterne? Wherefore withdraw not from the thorny ways And unreclaimable wilderness of this world, To the smooth-marbled aisle and cloister trim Beside us; to these gardens, paced by forms Bland-whispering as their trees, and moving round Each shrub they tend, softly as its own shadow? Wherefore retire thee not, wouldst thou enjoy Calm raptures of ecstatic contemplation, To yon elm-pillar'd avenue, sky roof'd, That leads from Minster Church to Monastery, Both by thyself embeautified, as if But for thyself? Nothing disturbeth there Save the grand hum of the organ heard within, Or murmuring chorus that with faint low chime Tremble to lift their voices up o'er-high Even in God's praises?—Here find happiness, Here make thy quietary! as thy Sister Once queen, hath done. Wherefore not, thou and she, Abbot and Abbess, side by side, return To old companionship of innocence, Our hearts re-purified at the altar's flame; And thus let second childhood lead us, lovingly As did the first, adown life's gentle slope, To our unrocking cradle—one same grave? Ethelstan. I could, even now, sleep to the lullaby Sung by Death's gossip, that assiduous crone, Who hushes all our race!—if one hope fail, One single, life-endearing hope— Edgitha. Dear brother, Take hope from my content!—though pale this brow, 'Tis calm as if she smiled on it, yon Prioress Of Heaven's pure Nunnery, whose placid cheer O'erlooks the world beneath her; this wren's voice Though weak, preserveth lightsome tone and tenor, Ne'er sick with joy like the still-hiccuping swallow's, Ne'er like the nightingale's with grief. Believe me Seclusion is the blessedest estate Life owns; wouldst be among the blest on earth, Hie thither! Ethelstan. Ay—and what are my poor Saxons To do without their king?— Edgitha. Have they not thanes And chiefs?— Ethelstan. Without their father? their defender? Now specially when rumours of the Dane Borne hither by each chill Norwegian wind, Like evening thunder creeps along the ocean With many a mutter'd threat of morrow dire? No! no! I must not now desert my Saxons, Who ne'er deserted me! Edgitha. Is there none else To king it? Ethelstan. None save the Etheling should; he cannot: Childe Edmund is o'er-green in wit; though premature In that too for his years, and grown by exercise Of arms, and practice of all manlike feats,— Which his bent towards them makes continual, As young hawks love to use their beaks and wings In coursing sparrows ere let loose at herons,— Grown his full pitch of stature. Ah! dear Sister, Thy choice and lot with thy life's duties chime, All cast for privacy. So best!—our world Hath need of such as thee and thy fair nuns, And these good fathers of the monastery, To teach youth, tend the poor, the sick, the sad, Relume the extinguish'd lights of ancient lore, Making each little cell a glorious lantern To beam forth truth o'er our benighted age,— With other functions high, howe'er so humble, Which I disparage not! But, dearest Sister, Even the care of our own soul becomes A sin—base selfishness—when we neglect All care for others; and self-love too oft Is the dark shape in which the Devil haunts Nunneries, monkeries, and most privacies, Where your devout recluse, devoted less To God than self, works for his single weal; When like that God he should, true Catholic, Advance the universal where he may. Edgitha. Did Satan then haunt holy hermit Paul? Ethelstan. He haunted the Most Holy in the Wilderness! But what did this meek sample for all men? The good King-Shepherd? Did he tend himself, Alone, I pray? or did he tend his sheep? O Sister, my great duty to my God Involves my duty to my neighbour-men, And that is, to be his vicegerent o'er them, Protector, saviour—no angelic Guardian, But yet a guardian still! Edgitha. Wisest and best Of secular men, I own thee! Ethelstan. Weakest and worst! A fool of traitorous spies and tales of treason! My brother's murderer! an unbranded Cain, Who hears the ground, where'er he walks, cry out Vengeance!—You see this penitential garb, Yet call me best of men? Edgitha. It has been worn Long, long enow! 'Tis time it were put off. Ethelstan. How soon will he put off his wretched shroud? O Edgitha! Edgitha. Pour all into my breast! Thine is o'erflowing! Ethelstan. No!—Unbosom'd pain Is half dismiss'd. I'll keep my punisher with me.— Press me not!—there's a way to crush the heart And still its aching, as you bind the head When it throbs feverish. Edgitha. Have care of that! There is a way to secret suicide, By crushing the swoln heart until you kill. Beware!—self-death is no less sinful, given By sorrow's point conceal'd than by the sword. Ethelstan. Nay, I am jocund—let's to supper!—There! A king shall be his own house-knight, and serve. See what a feast! we Saxons love good cheer!— [He takes from a cupboard pulse, bread, and water. Edgitha. Ah! when he will but smile, how he can smile! 'Tis feigning all! this death sits on his bosom Heavily as Night-Mara's hornèd steed: His cares for the whole realm oppress him too: And our book-learned Prior oft draws up From some deep fountain a clear drop of truth,— Great Natures are much given to melancholy.— Thanks, hospitable brother!—fare superfluous To me who have supp'd, but somewhat scant for thee. Come! here's your oaken throne. [She places a joint stool, and he sits. I thank thee more That thou hast, for my sake, preserved at least These gold-bright locks, which crest them on thy brow Most crown-like, and abroad thy shoulders flow As rich waves spread beneath the yellowing sun.— Ethelstan. Yes! yes! it was for thee—I had an inkling, Albeit recluse, thou wert right woman still, And lov'dst a gaud or two— Edgitha (smoothing his hair). Which I was wont, When we were boy and girl, to tress and twine With amber threads, in our old Saxon wise, And sleek as I do now, till 'neath my hand Bright and more bright they shone as they would burn— Ethelstan. Sit down! sit down! and meddle with thy meal, Trifler!—This moment thou wouldst have me shorn To a bare monk, and now—Come, banquet! banquet! Edgitha. Wilt thou eat none? Ethelstan. I am athirst—nought else. Edgitha. After thy long, long route? Ethelstan. I am athirst! And have a kind of creeping fever on me, My throat feels close and dry—thirst, only thirst. Scene closes. SCENE III. Outside St. John's Church. Ellisif alone, listening at a portal. Ellisif. What stays him?—how he crawls, two-footed reptile!— A step?—hark!—no!—on the blank floor a water-drop Loud echoes as a footfall:—Hist!—Come!—Come!— Prior (entering from the portal). Here is the key—you know our secret way— Ellisif. Ay, all your secret ways!— Prior. Slip through the undercroft,— Down the blind passage,—move the hinge-hung stone— Ellisif. Enough!—Is he gone yet? Prior. And wish'd me rest This moment, crossing by me. Ellisif. Let him wish Rest to himself!—Better than his to-night I wish thee, Prior!—No more whispering—go!— Prior. Faith, this shrill wind and we make such a whispering In these drear nooks, as lion's flesh would crimple at! I shiver,—so will safe to bed and warm me! [Exeunt severally. SCENE IV. Nave of St. John's Church, and Prince Edwin's Tomb. Night-time. Bruern in the distance, behind a column. Enter Ethelstan from a wicket. Ethelstan. Look up, faint king!—tho' like the shuddering wretch That glares upon the corse of him he slew!— I must go on—yea, did these hollow vaults Groan sensitive at each step, as if I trod Over the bosoms of expiring men Who cursed me and so died!—Where is his tomb? Mine eyes seem loose, and wander, yet see nought— Or fall—fall—still to earth! Can I remember?— What were the marks? which is it?—Pale Fear clutches me By each wild lock, and tears me from myself!— Oh I am all distract!—Patience!—'Twas thus, Was it not?—Ay!—thus said the Prior, thus— Now comes back memory, like a scarce-wish'd friend! ‘Fast by the column, next but two the Tower, Where at first bell the morning-moon will shine, Prince Edwin sleeps'—Would I could sleep his sleep!— ‘Of beach-worn stone his bed, and as thou badest, Scoop'd like a billowy sea'—Of stone? hard stone? Thrice comfortable couch to what I, nightly, Take my unrest on! guilt turns to a rack My bed of smoothest rushes! gives them thorns To pierce and harrow me as I writhe!—Well—well: ‘His pillow of marble, wrought with fringe like foam; His eyes turn'd blindly up to heaven, as if Closed on all hope of succour'—I sent none! Edwin I sent thee none!—I was more deaf Than the stunn'd sea-rock; frothier and more frenzied Than the white rage around it; crueller still Than ocean that in wrath precipitate, on thee Burst—whelming thy sad cries with careless roar!— O tyrant! tyrant king! fiend-hearted brother!— How deep is hell? My brain whirls as I think on't; Darkness will swallow me ever! O that it could! But to look up thence, and behold him pleading With angel face wash'd silver pale by tears, Sea-worn,—his locks yet heavy from the brine,— Pleading my pardon—Let me not look there! Kindness cuts deeper, undeserved, than Hate Plunge at thee as she will!—What else?—‘His eyes Closed on all hope of succour; so he lay When he was found dead-floating to the shore, And so, as thou ordainedst, lies he here?’ Yon length-laid statue facing heaven so calm, Must e'en be his. Dare I approach it nigher? O God! how pale he looks, while on his cheek The ghastly moonbeams glisten!—Yet he's calm; His bosom heaves not with a sigh,—sure proof At once of grief and life!—Here stand I, miserable! Drench'd in the cold sweat of mine agony, Who, but for such sad breathings-out, might seem As much a stone as he!—Dead at the heart, A mere, mere gloss of life upon my surface, Where all shows smooth,—but I am dead within! Let me rush forward, and kneel down and beg [Approaching. Forgiveness of him who was ever kind! Nought stays me— [The bell tolls one. Ha! that dread bell sounds like thunder, Shaking the huge tower o'er me as 'twould fall, Did I proceed!—'Twas but that bronze recorder Toll'd, and the vasty silence and surprise Made it so loud. O bright, pure eye of Heaven, Wilt thou still search me out, and blazon me Thus, wheresoe'er in darkness I would hide? Blest Moon, why smile upon a murderer? He hates thy glitter on him, like a leprosy! It mads me, wolf-like, and I feel bedropt With a cold-scalding mildew!—Why, that's well, Thou starest at me no more!—Alas, shine forth! Leave me not thus to night's dark angels swaying Their gleamless swords about me!— (Kneels at the tomb.) I will kneel!— O thou whose spirit hovering o'er this tomb Look'st down upon thy prostrate brother here, And see'st his penitence, and his soul's pain, Say with thy heart-heard voice, shall he for ever Shall he be unforgiven? Ellisif (from behind the tomb). Unforgiven! Ethelstan. Hell's scream within mine ears!—Conscience, 'tis thou Affright'st me thus!—What fantasy is this? Spake I so shrill, the Daughter of the Rock, Wild Echo, should have woke with such a shriek?— My flesh felt like a swarm of living atomies When I did hear it!—Shall I quake at nought More than an echo? Ellisif. More than an echo! Ethelstan (starting up). Ay? Then Ethelstan is more himself!—What art, That mock'st my words?—Hell-born or human fiend, Thou shalt speak for thyself!—Bind not, O Darkness! A brave man's hands, that know not where to strike! Ellisif. Thy sword were vain on me, fell it as bright And swift as meteor shoots. I was the breath Of thy lorn brother while he lived,—am now The wan, invisible warder of his tomb! Ethelstan. Too thin and wire-sharp voice hast thou for his. Ellisif. The serpents of the pit, to which thou sent'st me, Gave me that meagre voice their wrizzled throats Utter amid the mire! Ethelstan. I could not send thee Where thy sins sank thee not. Ellisif. When thou didst cast Thy brother forth to die, he was unshriven; Unshriven, so unforgiven—as thou shalt be! Ethelstan. If we repent are we not all forgiven? Ellisif. We are forgiven as we forgive; didst thou Forgive thy brother? Ethelstan. God is more merciful Than man to man! O were we but forgiven As we forgive, how few were e'er absolved! My trust in Christ is firmer than in thee, And he hath to the penitent promised pardon. Ellisif. Ay! fool thee with the hope thou'rt penitent, Yet wear'st a lawless crown! that some few tears Can wash the scarlet out of such a sin As stains thy soul!—Didst thou not, when the sea Was gurliest, and his green face pale with ire, When the winds lash'd him till he roll'd in pain His huge-ribb'd skeleton back, didst thou not choose That merciless mood of his, to fling thy brother Into his gulfy maw, which, at each yawn Disclosing hell, had swirl'd down, not a boat, But a great ark itself?—O then they howl'd Thy damning chorus from the deep abysm— Last-born of Cain, come hither! Ethelstan. Horrible! horrible! Ellisif. Ocean, thy complice blind, was far more penitent: His grappling surge that gather'd his poor prey, Too small for note, beneath his ponderous bosom, Released it, like an infant overlain, Next morn; and bore his innocent bedmate home Unto its mother earth, with rude wild wail, Raving for what his restlessness had done! Ethelstan. I was not less remorseful, nor did less The little all of recompense—too late! He heap'd thee o'er with shells, I raised this tomb Costliest, in thy honour. Ellisif. Where's my throne? Thou undermined'st that? Where's the bright form Which clothed me like a creature of the sun? Thou stripped'st me of that even to these bones! Where is the breath of joyful life which Heaven Breathed in my nostrils? Thou hast turn'd that, that, Into the blue sulphureous flame I utter, Condemn'd to burn in my own ire against thee! Ethelstan. If my rash deed have made thee thus a devil Who wast near angel, I were rightly damn'd. Ellisif. Thou art! thou art!—Thy last, thy fondest hope Of any bliss on earth, mark how I quench it: She, whom thou lovèst so, long lost, late found, Thy queen elect, the saint thy heart enshrines, She whom thou dream'st will, like another self, Double thy joys, divide thy woes,—that peerless one, Hates thee as I do! Ethelstan. Ellisif? Ellisif. Even she! Ethelstan. My bleeding heart's sole balm to poison turn'd! O she's not false!—She makes me who did cause, Howe'er unwilling, her dear father's death, Fast from the luxury of her sight awhile, Till, purified in penitential tears, Mine eyes may taste of it again:—nought else! Thou art the false one, thou much changèd spirit, If thou have even the substance of a shade! Ellisif. My speech hath touch'd thy conscience to the quick: Take now this bloody stigma from my hand, Proof I am no false vision! [A flash of moonlight—Ellisif vanishes—Bruern, sheathing his sword, shrinks aside. Ethelstan. Thy foul purpose Dreaded the light, which scared thee too!—Thou wert, Sure, but my superstition's child alone? Nor trace—nor footfall—fleeting form—nor shadow Tells of thee!—Ha! what church-breaker art thou? Come forth, assassinative shape! [Seeing Bruern. Bruern. I cannot: Good pilgrim, do an outlaw'd man no harm. Ethelstan. Forth, slave, I say! Bruern. Ne'er trust me! By this altar The Chair of Safety is, to which I'm chain'd. Ethelstan. Chain'd? Bruern. Ay, by fear's strong fetters; for I bear A wolf's head—whoso brings it in gets gold!— Let me to sleep again. Ethelstan. Knave, it was thou Held insolent parley with me here:—Confess! Bruern. Most like! bytimes I babble in my sleep. Ethelstan. That rheumy voice, like grating of a rope, Could not have feign'd such piercing words.—Speak, felon! Where's thy fine-spoken friend? Bruern. There! Ethelstan. Who? Bruern. Prince Edwin! Ethelstan. Why, what art thou, that let'st thy blunt words fall Like stones in thick ooze dropp'd from some high tower, When of such perilous moment they may sink The stranded bark beneath, without thy caring? Bruern. Churl Bruern I!—the Prince's man. Ethelstan. Thou scape Great Ocean's watery ordeal, and not he? That chance was given him for sweet Mercy's sake; If innocent, I trusted saviour wings Would hover round his barque, and fan it o'er To some blest island, though fleet-wrecking storms Blew in its teeth, and undulous mountains rose Moon-high between it and its harbourage. Bruern. Then innocent I, as those same wings brush'd me Back to this island blest! Ethelstan. That shakes my creed: Wherefore but thee? Bruern. Long time upon the gunwale The Prince stood,—like white-eyed Despair,—then suddenly Leapt far into the flood with a mad shriek, And sank: but I, more harden'd in mishaps, Clung fast to the boat's bottom as a barnacle, While she stuck to herself; then on my shield, Which oft a soldier makes his raft, I scull'd it With an old stave, witch-like, across the deep; Till Providence, who protects the innocent, Flung me, nigh shapeless, mash'd to merman spawn, Weltering ashore. Ethelstan. Why iterate to me Thy innocence? Bruern. Dread, sir, I know my king. The majesty of his sunbright locks betray'd him, Albeit in pilgrim weed. Ethelstan. Say,—and be pardon'd Thy treason here, in virtue of that death Thou almost suffer'd for no treason done,— Who was it now assail'd me by that tomb? Bruern. My liege, I know not. Ethelstan. Heard'st thou nought? Bruern. I heard A low voice down the aisle mumbling of beads And paternosters, till its hum beguiled me, As doth the drowsy purr of a beldam's wheel Her nodding self, to sleep. Ethelstan. Nor saw'st nought? Bruern. Where? Ethelstan. Here! Bruern. When, sire? Ethelstan. At that moonburst from the murk? Bruern. Thy royal self. Ethelstan. None else? Bruern. I saw a screech-owl Whirr from yon niche into the cloister near; None else, though so long custom'd to this gloom, Bat-like I could chase moths, or spy out things As dusk of coat as my half-brother mouse, Dotting the distant floor. Ethelstan. Doth maddening sorrow Conjure up semblances, yea, phantom sounds, Beyond the dread creations of a dream? It may be so!—'Tis held that warning voices Do come at times from dead mouths to quick ears, Which thrill as cold to hear them!—Sure, 'twas scarce Bold treason, too refined for this coarse worker? Begone! (To Bruern),—and clear mine eyesight of a blot! Although, perchance, unguilty of this deed, Thou hast been aye a dark and dangerous man, Whose ill society suspicion cast On all permitting it; my thoughtless brother Kept too much commerce with thee, and thy like, Who turn to damning though dumb witnesses Against their friends in jeopardy.—Begone, Lourer! as sullen-eyed as untamed steer, And as strong-headed thy wild course to roam. Begone! I may repent my mercy too! [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Court of St. John's Monastery. Edmund Etheling and Prince Haco, throwing the spear. Edmund (throwing). There! two good lengths beyond you, prince! Haco. Scarce one! Edmund. Mayhap scarce one of my spear's, but full two Of your short pikestaff's. Haco. O you are so proud Of wielding that tall ash-plant you pluck'd up! It fits right apt your Colbrand fist!—A spear For wild-swine hunters, not for warriors! Edmund. It will do well upon the litter then Farrow'd by Norway, who come routing hither So oft, to fat them in our acorn'd land! Haco. I know you'll prove another Turketul! And, like a tower on wheels shoved into battle, Swaying about your windmill arms, whiff down Unwieldily all approachers: you bluff Saxons! But try me at sword exercise, where skill Makes strength— Edmund. Good faith, I'd give you Gaudiosa, Charlemagne's famous blade, and beat you after With a stout bulrush!—You! Haco. Well, I'll not quarrel: My royal foster-father strict forbids us. Are we not brethren? The same king who calls Me ‘foster-son,’ treats you too as his child. Edmund (to himself). I hope he will not treat me as his brother!— Poor Edwin! thy dark fate be-clouds my days And keeps me aye a-chill! Haco. I know the cause Of all this! Edmund. What? Haco. You're jealous I shall tangle The wildbird we would both lime if we could, With love's rich honey-dew! Edmund. The King's glee-maiden? She loves a hawk's spark-throwing eye far better Than Haco's soft-blue gaze! Ay, and would take England's fierce falcon rather to her bosom Than Norway's tercel-gentle! Haco. Not yet long enough Mew'd in your Southron court-cage, to be pluck'd at Tamely—defend thyself! [Draws. Enter Runilda in huntress apparel. Runilda (muttering to herself). O'er the wild gannet's bath Come the Norse coursers!— Ha! who be ye That sheathe your bare swords in each other's bosoms? Well done! O well! Edmund. Nay, Haco is our guest, 'Twere scarce well done to make his flesh my scabbard; I drew my brand but to protect myself. Runilda. Proceed, good youths! Edmund. Erewhile thou wert more given, With words as sweet as songs, to harmonise Our jarring souls.—No! no! mermaiden never Breathed with her dulcet voice so still a calm Over contentious waves, as thou o'er us! Nor billows, lull'd by murmuring summer wind, When bees are heard in it far, far off land, E'er fell to that smooth level so entranced, As we did then into delighted swoon, Thus to be quell'd by thee! Runilda. 'Twill not be quell'd!— My brain is big with it!—'twill forth, all arm'd! Howe'er it came—since the dawn sprang—even now A gory form, War, with his hundred wounds And trumpet that drops blood, doth cross my sight! Sharp-singing lances whirr athwart mine ear, And shiver at my feet! close to mine eyes Bright swords are clashing! Yea, as quakes deep earth Ere Hecla burst, through every sense doth thrill The shock of unseen armies!—Hark! that din, Made thick with shrieks, and groans, and battle cries— Gladden'd with shouts victorious now—and now, Alas! the field of blood sends up a wail Too low to reach heaven, but spreads to my heart!— Look! where the mangled corses writhe and heave With life intolerable—thousand limbs, The woe of sense not yet shook off, lie weltering Like seaweeds at red sunset, up and down!— O Glory, thou stand'st nearest to the skies As doth the pine, brushing them with thy plumes, But earliest art struck prostrate!—Therefore I say, Well done, sweet youths!—Come North and South together At once, if we must e'en have storm. Fight on Stout Edmund and keen Haco! Haco. Saw you her ever So moved before as this? Edmund. Never! nor heard Her reedy voice utter such mournful sounds Even at her fitfullest times. Some one hath touch'd The master-spring of passion in her breast With hand too violent. What would she mean? Runilda. Heard you not that prophetic snatch I sung?— ‘O'er the wild gannet's bath Come the Norse coursers!’ What would she mean? I tell thee, Edmund Etheling, A thundercloud hangs o'er thee, ripe to burst!— My brain sounds like an armourer's forge, klang! klang! You Saxon War-smiths are at work! ye shape Thor's iron marriage-rings for coats of mail, Bend helms, and on the anvil turn the blade, Hardening it!—Haco, I tell thee, mine ear Is full of far-borne echoes, like the shell That thrills with dread intelligence from the main!— Ay, scout my warnings, call me rapture-mad! So do the world's wise fools by all our tribe, And yet, great Heaven, what truths we've sung!—No matter! What need my little maidhood care? I'm safe As in a star, roll earth which way it please!— Still round her, with art-magical of song, Her sanctuary circle draws, unseen, The blithe Glee-maiden, pure enchantress true! Still winds she on from fairy ring to ring Transgress'd by no bold foot, the Minstrel Girl! Throughout song-loving Saxon land securest, Yea among camps, and courts more dangerous— Enter a House-carl. Edmund. Captain, what now? House-carl. The king is ill at ease, And seeks his custom'd music. Runilda. I'll not go! House-carl (advancing). Nay, mistress, but his grace must be amused. Runilda (drawing a dirk). Off, churl!—Stain royalty with thy slave's touch?— Am I not Queen of the Minstrels' sacred quire? Back, or I'll nail thy breastplate on! Haco (to Edmund). O proudness! Her spirit guards her better than her spells: See how her ire-bright eye answers her steel Fierce flash for flash, blackness as keenly blazing As brilliant ore itself! Edmund (to him). It is a picture! Now sails she to and fro a swan before him, Looking disdain ascaunce on the poor hound That dared bark at her! Haco (to Runilda). Lady, 'twere more wise You did attend the king; his natural mood Is gentleness, which sorrow hath made gentler; But stir him not, O wake not for thy soul The anger of a gentle-hearted man! 'Tis like the summer-thunder, fearfullest, Because from heaven's perturbed calm forced out. Runilda. I muse! I muse!—let me alone! Edmund. Thou art Fortune's spoilt pet and his; a dove that still Pecks at the hand she sits on. Runilda. Fortune's forsooth? His too?—I thank him!—Well, the sphere rolls round, And its fires with it!—some of them may strike!— ‘O'er the wild gannet's bath [Chanting. Come the Norse coursers!’ Edmund. I do beseech you, dareful maiden, go! Runilda. Not a snail's step!—It is no time, believe me, For lullabies to babies young or old! Edmund. Let me plead thy own cause with thy stern self: Bring not disfavour's blast on thee by waywardness So blind; but docile, tend as thou wert wont The king's repose. Runilda (underbreath). And be a Judith to him, When I have charm'd to sleep!—(Aloud) Let me begone. Haco. Where, Maiden? Runilda. With thane Alger's wife a-falconing! She bid me thither: I am to ride black Merlin, That rasps the hard flint-road with sparkling hoof, But through the woodland springs, a very deer, High as the boughs! Edmund. This is all obdurate talk; She will not go. Enter Prince Fergus. She will not go, Prince Fergus! We are desperate of her. Fergus. Lo! how my bird-call here Will lure the wild one down. [Touching a harp. Runilda. My harp! my harp! Come to me, bosom friend!—My fingers glow To grapple thee, and with their fiery touch Kindle thy glittering strings!— Fergus. Wilt follow me! Runilda. Anywhere!—take me!—take me!— O'er the wild gannet's bath— [Exit chanting, led by Fergus. Haco. Womanhood!— That bends no jot to reason, interest, power,— But yields her for a toy!—That lustrous harp Made her brow shine, as eagles' eyes grow yellow At the engolden'd sun! Edmund. What witchery dwells About this little Bardess, that she makes Her very faults seem loveable, and her masters With strange art keeps her slaves?—Ah! sceptred Beauty, Queen even of kings, and Conqueress! but not yet Imperial quite, until the heaven-dropp'd orb Of genius crown thee!—then, omnipotent! [Exeunt. SCENE II. The King's Cabinet. Ethelstan on a Couch. Enter Fergus and Runilda. Ethelstan. O!—come at last, my fair perversity? Sit ye down here: I know your tribe's free nature, Less ruly than the wind-sway'd sea, obeys The changeful moon alone. Sit down, prince Fergus.— Now, a soul-soothing strain, that may hum by me As runnel sweet by slumbrous shepherd's ear.— What is this for? why dost thou clash the strings, Tearing, so falcon-like, as 'twere a victim, Thy loved harp's breast? Fie! fie! a gentler passion! Runilda. It comes!—it comes!—but like the hill-flood's roar, When earth-shook pinnacles their sheeted rocks Roll in confounding unison, that makes The faint stars echo—when hoarse ocean chimes— When tempest-slanted forests turn their leaves To whistles shrill—and innocent birds attune Their shrieks to vultures' screams—when beasts untameable Stand bellowing for bare fear—when heaven itself Is one loud forge of flashing bolts, and cave Rifted with ever-bursting thunders.—Nay, Waft it not from thee thus!—'twill come!—but soon Be soft enough, as death's last, groanless sigh, The strength of agony spent— Ethelstan. What dreadful cliff Hath turn'd her brain? what whirlwind hath enrapt her, That she's so giddy-headed? Fergus. Now, sir, she's still, Fix'd as a wild-way cross, and looks as bleak!— Ethelstan. Good!—there's a spreading life upon her face That whitens to a smile. Dreamer, awake! Runilda. With my lark's throat I warble forth my glee! With my lark's glance far, far a-field I see! Look ocean-ward!—Said I not true!—They come! Look! look! look! look! [Breaking into a loud chant. O'er the wild gannet's bath Come the Norse coursers! O'er the whale's heritance Gloriously steering! With beaked heads peering, Deep-plunging, high-rearing, Tossing their foam abroad, Shaking white manes aloft, Creamy-neck'd, pitchy-ribb'd, Steeds of the Ocean! O'er the Sun's mirror green Come the Norse coursers! Trampling its glassy breadth Into bright fragments! Hollow-back'd, huge-bosom'd, Fraught with mail'd riders, Clanging with hauberks, Shield, spear, and battleaxe, Canvas-wing'd, cable-rein'd, Steeds of the Ocean! O'er the Wind's ploughing-field Come the Norse coursers! By a hundred each ridden, To the bloody feast bidden, They rush in their fierceness And ravine all round them! Their shoulders enriching With fleecy-light plunder, Fire-spreading, foe-spurning, Steeds of the Ocean!— Ethelstan. Still this wild barding? Runilda. 'Tis as true and wise As that we write on rocks to last for ages, Channeling our dark lore in mystic Runes. There! See you there? is that no cloud aloft? Ethelstan. Yea, black as Night's breath. Runilda. 'Tis a cloud of ravens, That croak of slaughter, echoing Rumour's knell! Ethelstan. The blackness travels north; here is bright sun; What say you now, ill-boding bird? Runilda. O blindness! See you what sanguine streaks do scar that sun, Portending crimson times? Last night, remember thee, What did thine eyes behold? As thou rodest hither Were not the Northern Streamers blood-red flames? Glanced not the mountain-rills beneath the moon As if 'twere blood they ran with?—did they not, King? Ethelstan. Thy own mind's eye is bloodshot. Runilda. He's unsavable! Death's film is drawn already o'er his eye, He cannot see his tomb-ward steps!—I've done!— Towards him my duty's o'er! Ethelstan. Lead her away: Her mind's distemperature hath infected me: Take her, prince Fergus. Runilda. Fergus, fair-hair'd Fergus! Do not thou stop thine ears and seal thine eyes; Death's arrows fill the air—to house! to house! Go you not forth—the God of Battle grim Gapes with sepulchral mouth to swallow thee! Go you not forth, young Fergus—'tis to die! Fergus. Well, well, with thee to chant my coronach, Immortal maker! I shall be content. Runilda (chanting). O woe! for the fair-hair'd son of the Gael! Red, red is his royal blood, That fresh from his heart, O woe and wail! Lies under him in a flood! Fergus. Come, come, the King looks at us. [Exit, leading Runilda. Ethelstan. I know well What spawn foul ocean genders!—Ran her brain Less on such perilous themes—war, spoil, invasion, I'd say she had some knowledge, of a truth, The fry had grown to monsters.—Fate works strangely! Well must it work for me, however ill, As I am at the worst! But one frail reed Hangs o'er the brink of that deep gulf beneath me, Break this, and I fall in!—The proof is nigh. [Exit. SCENE III. A Cell. Ellisif. Ellisif. He was much shaken; but stands firmly yet, Like a half-ruin'd tower: my enginery Hath struck him once, and on the crossbow groove Another crag sits waiting to be hurl'd, Another and another still at hand: O! he should boast, if rocks could bury him Heap'd at my bidding, a gigantic cairn! My wrath sublime would raise such monument To both, as should out-dure and over-peer The sky-aspiring hills.—Guilt and Avengement Should rest entomb'd together; prostrate he Beneath, she tiptoe on the pinnacle, Like Victory that crowns herself!—Fool Ethelstan Would have them kiss, and couch together, alive;— Sooner I'd couch me in a sulphurous bed And couple with the dragon.—But my suitor Must now be seen—I am prepared!—I've sown A whirlwind for his reaping; Edmund hath caught The white plague—fear!—that's ever a sore sting, Suspicion undeserved from those we love. Then I have wrought with my young Bower-Maiden; Which will prove bitter too; let the fond rhapsodist Rave of the clouded ills which beetle o'er us, 'Tis but the wildwood lyre by zephyrs rung, Wailing perplexedly its airy woes, Smiled at though pitied!—She was lured at once; Trivial confidings win great confidence, When with vague whispers swoln, they seem too big For the awe-shrunken ear— My summoner! Enter a Nun. Nun. Our sovran-abbess in the speaking room Attendeth Maiden Ellisif. Ellisif. She comes— [Exit Nun. “Our sovran-abbess,” who, as simple as faith, As credulous as hope, as blind as love, Thinks what is done with a fair front is fair! A good face that, froze into one still smile, For greeting all the world!—a good set face! Grief hath not graven mine yet deep enough, But opening back my braids thus,—and 'tis smoothable: No better mask than chill unchangingness; Ethelstan, wise, judicial Ethelstan, He shall my centred soul guess from my surface As gaping sages do the moon's true nature From her snow-bright apparency!—Than depth Surface much more unfathomable is, Whene'er impenetrable! Am not I Woman? And was not art her nature ever? [Exit. SCENE IV. The Convent Parlour. Edgitha. Enter Ellisif. Edgitha. Welcome, fair Daughter! Ellisif. Like salute to thee, Fair Mother of our flock! Edgitha. Thou art not yet One of it; nor perchance wilt ever be. Ellisif. My year novicial has to run; meantime The age is awful in strange accidents! Edgitha. Nothing so strange for Maiden Ellisif, So fresh in youth, so flourishing in beauty, High-fated from her birth, to mount a throne. The King comes hither presently; no longer Will he be blush'd off. Ellisif (aside). Blush'd off!—Ah, good lady! Talks to me as to some rose-modest lass, Whose heart is in her cheeks!—(Aloud) Madam, I'm here Pale but untrembling. Edgitha. Well, if marriages Must be, they're best when cool-consider'd—Hark you That hasty trump? [Flourish without. I leave you:—(Aside) Wondrous calm! [Exit. Ellisif. He comes, like one condemn'd, with claspèd hands, But faster to his fate!—How my proud heart Grows large within me, as the lioness swells Her ireful bosom to meet him that slew Her forest lord!—Patience, thy vizard yet! Enter Ethelstan. Ethelstan. Dread Spirit! thou wert a truth then?—She does hate me! Her father's grave is still a gulf between us Unpassable; I, a wretched darkler here, See her, blest angel, on the other side Glittering in beauty's light!—Fix'd as a statue? I will beseech her; icicles themselves Melt at warm sighs, shall not this snowy creature? O lady! look'st thou at the heavens to call Some wandering meteor down with singèd hair To wrap me in its fires? Ellisif. My noblest father! Heaven's errant thunder lighted upon thee, Albeit babe-innocent of treason foul. Ethelstan. Was the fault mine?—My heart was aye the fount Of mercy more than justice!—Death, swift death Had been awarded Alfred thane, known partner With the doom'd Edwin; scaffold palls were hung; The sharp axe glisten'd in thy father's eye, But 'tween the block and him Persuasion knelt In Pity's plight of outspread arms and tears, Which saved him. Ellisif. I wept not! Ethelstan. Thy image did, Thy secret self, closeted in my bosom! Therefore though my whole Mote of Wisemen oped One mouth against him, I did send thy father To clear himself at Peter's Roman chair By oath; his soul was on it, and ne'er came Back from Heaven's bar. Ellisif. Yea, for good men will die No less than ill, and oftener at their prayers! Ethelstan. Then, gentle Ellisif, he might have died Had he been state-absolved, and sent to offer Thanksgiving here at Beverley,—might have died In any act or hour: 'twas not a judgment, Haply, fell on him, but that chance which lets The sinner sink to hell in bed of roses, The sainted rise to heaven from rack or pyre!— Where was my guilt? Ellisif. I cannot 'stablish it; Thou dost plead speciously. Ethelstan. Truth pleads in me, And Love, who makes the breath glow, which thou see'st Burn round my lips, as round the earnest steed's His soul for victory flaming!—Have long years Spent in the learned Western Isle religious, Left thee untaught—Forgetfulness is virtue When, howso deep, Offence is undesign'd? Hath Solitude, which, for companionship, Brings back our former selves, never recall'd Thy vow, love-sweet, to me—long times ago? Vow unredeem'd, on natural excuse Of thy dear father's death; by me unclaim'd Then, while endured my penance for a deed Which makes the Valley of the Shadow of Death Still darker to my view—Edwin's sad fate! Ellisif. Well wept, crocodile!—thou wept'st, to lure him Into thy clutches, weep'st to lure me now! This water of the brain how flush it is In your great-headed hypocrites, but fatal Unto their dupes!—Stay; his soft, drunken eyes Grow dry again. Ethelstan. I am not given to tears. Ellisif. Some weaknesses from strong affections spring; They are too warm, and make too soft the heart. Ethelstan. It is a gracious sentence!—I have loved Too well for mine own peace. Yet I'll love on, Even those who cause me anguish: 'tis not, lady, Our enemies wound us inliest, but ever Our dear, domestic friends! who take us sleeping, Suspicionless—our pillow on their lap, And plant it thick with thorns! If not themselves, Their demons do it, who of their follies, faults, Misfortunes, sow the pointed crop, which strikes Into the quick of feeling, while our foes With their most fiend-like shafts but pierce its shell. Ellisif. 'Tis a sad lesson! Ethelstan. Ay, to be learn'd by heart! Could Anlaf make me weep? Edwin hath done it! The Dane, my direst foe; he, my loved brother!— O maiden! thou couldst never count the tears Of blood he costs me; but I swallow them! And now five rueful winters, twelve months each, Warrant a gentle spring, the annual dawn Of summer's holiday to life-long sorrow: Make it so, or I perish at the heart, Even at my timeliest hour of flourishing; Ah! let the bright-eyed deity in thy looks Shine on me, and revive! Ellisif. Thou see'st me here, Firm to perform all deep vows I have sworn Long since, and daily. I withdrew, self-banish'd, To mourn my orphan-hood, and save thy soul Threaten'd, between thy passionate flame and vow Of penitence, with distraction, or destruction. Ethelstan. O kindness in unkindness! faith in faithlessness!— Well, well, I am content!—My life clears up Brighter at last, like to a rainbow eve, In this departing shower!—So, it is gone!— Henceforth I may be happy! Upon thee, My comforter, my counseller, is all Ethelstan's human trust! thou, thou my second But chiefest self, first in my love and pride, For thy head wears bright Wisdom's crown, while mine Scarce fills what many a royal fool hath worn, The poor crown politic. Ellisif. Flatter me not, but let me Try all my skill of comfort and of counsel, Study the craft of state, and from thee learn Its secrets to promote them: I'm no girl That loves but dress, dance, sempstery, and song!— Yet, as do Saxons all, doth Maiden Ellisif Honour the harp, and hath some gift in glee— Ethelstan. Then shalt thou the sweet exercise pursue And bring me happy dreams! My Harper-Girl Of late is somewhat o'er-inspired—is mad Even above minstrel measure. Here, my signet! 'Twill make thee free, as my betrothed wife, Of bower and cabinet: Come oft, stay long! Till marriage make us individual. Now dearest queen! tell me, and be my aid At once, as if thou wert my helpmate sworn, Didst thou hear aught, or guess, while in Ibernia, Of Anlaf and his host? That is a care Which delves a furrow in my brow, each time I think of it. Ellisif (aside). And soon shall harrow thy heart!— (To him.) They are unquiet ever in that Isle, But though King Anlaf threaten much, methought His preparations had his kingdom there, New-found yet scarce well-founded, more in prospect, Than that one he lost here— Ethelstan. Northumbria! Northumbria is in his eye and heart! Ellisif. I'll give my liege good reasons, to relieve him From that oppressive care— Ethelstan. Then, as we walk— [Exeunt discoursing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Royal Bower. Ethelstan on his couch asleep: Ellisif seated by the couch, thrums over a harp monotonously. An Attendant. Ellisif (ceasing to play). Both are entranced: well done!— (Softly to the Attendant.) Repose thee, go! Drowsiness with his beetle wings hath humm'd Thy lullaby too: retire!—She nods!—Dost hear me?— Go rest thee till I call, i'the outer chamber: Tread soft—wake not his grace—close the door easily,— As 'twere upon the dead! [Exit Attendant. Ellisif makes fast the bolt, and lets down the door-tapestry. So, 'tis well done! He sleeps!—My witching harp hath o'er him weft Slumber's soft web, and in its airy mesh His strength is ta'en as in an iron toil! There lies he powerless, as on some lone strand A youth by mermaid's murmurous song enswoon'd, Fool of her fatal shell!—What joy to view him Laid out for slaughter thus—thus at my mercy— Him, slayer of my husband and my father,— Him, who trod down their glory into dust, Now spurnable as a corpse beneath my feet!— (Drawing a dagger.) This tempter clings to me—'twill scarce be sheathed!— No! I'll not slay him; he shall live to crouch, Footstool of my ambition!—Sleep, sleep on, But not to rest! I've caught from thy bird-maiden A secret note of thee, which used with craft, Shall bring thee sleep thou'dst well exchange for wakefulness As dry-eyed as the sun's!—Lend me once more, Presence of my dead lord! thy sorrowful voice To thrill his soul with! that faint voice thy grave Yawns forth by night, and with the moaning winds Mingles spiritual!—Now, better skill'd, Let me assay it. (Goes behind the couch, and whispers plaintively into the King's ear.) Sleep'st thou, unkind brother? O canst thou sleep, nor think'st of Edwin torn Piecemeal by these wild horses of the sea! Ethelstan (dreaming, starts to his elbow). Ha!—here again? how can I save thee now?— Art not a corse? Ellisif. Lo! where the grim birds follow me! And gore my tender flesh—feast on my heart— The bleeding heart that loved thee, Ethelstan! Ethelstan (rising). Avaunt, foul raveners!—Where are my bow-men?— Off cormorants!—fly all my hawks at them!— Stanch his deep wounds!—cover his bosom up! Let me not see it bleed! Ellisif (following him). Hark how the blast Shrieks in mine ear!—the bitter-seething spray Wraps its cold shroud around me! Ethelstan. Still his eyes Turn their dull balls this way!—they pierce me through Into my heart's heart! Ellisif. Ethelstan, O cruel! Help me!—take off these writhing serpents here That strangle me in their weedy coils!—Now! now! They pull me to the bottom!—Help, help, Ethelstan! O I am lost! Ethelstan. Save him! a boat there! save him! Let me plunge for him, cowards!—Edwin! thy hand! Strain up to me!—My crown to him who saves thee! Ellisif. Gone!—sunk!—for ever!—Cruel, cruel king! O thou shalt drown in hell's sulphureous sea Of fathomless fire for this! Ethelstan (falling on his knees). Mercy! O mercy! Ellisif. Deliver then thy fatal signet up: Say—Where is that curst instrument which seal'd The warrant for my death? Ethelstan. There! in the casket! Under my pillow. Ellisif. Give me, that I may fling it Down to the infernal stithy where 'twas forged! Ethelstan. Take it! the touch doth scorch— (He opens a casket, and gives out a signet; she stamps a parchment with it, replaces it, and the casket also.) Now, am I saved? Is there a hope?—Speak! Speak!—He answers not!— O God, still unforgiven! Ellisif. Unforgiven! Ethelstan (awaking). Despair! Ellisif. My dearest liege, what hath so stirr'd you? Why move you from your couch? Lie down, lie down, And sleep as calm again. Ethelstan. Calm! I could sleep On bed of firiest martyrdom after this! O, I have seen such things, and heard!—my blood Is ice, my brain is fire!—Tell me, dear wife, Where have I been? Ellisif. Why here, upon your couch! Ethelstan. Wherefore didst not awake me? Ellisif. So I did: When just now, suddenly, with heaving breast, Thou didst begin to mutter some wild words, And started up—I thought 'twas well to wake thee! Ethelstan. Thanks, tenderest love!—It seem'd an age of pain, And pain the soul might burst with!—I will tell it thee; Let us away; some demon haunts this room! The air is breathless—let us away, sweet queen! Thou shalt console—shalt know all!—But for thee Anguish had turn'd me wild!—Thanks! thanks! thanks ever! [Exeunt. SCENE II. An Orchard. Fergus and Runilda. Fergus. Wilt thou forsake the bower that shelters thee? Where beauty's lip chirps love, sweet bird! to thee? Where a king's gorgeous hand caresses thee? Where kneeling chiefs serve up rich food for thee? Wilt thou unto the moory wealds, and hills Barren of berries even, reckless begone? Where the broad-winnowing kite, poised but to swoop, Soars with wide survey and earth-fix'd eye; Where foxes prowl, and catamountains spring Like creatures of the pinion on their prey? Bethink thee, beauteous songstress! O, bethink thee, Within these wildering woods, all over Isle, No covert safe but this for bird so rare! Runilda. It shall not be my cage, though it be golden! What! mew me here, who should, by right of song, Range the Isle round, like ocean's margin-wave, Pouring a tide of melody on each strand? Coop with these tame fowl, yet not of their kin? Let my brave plumage rather be pluck'd off, And cut away my crest!—Why should I stay? My place is given another! Maiden Ellisif Is the king's Glee-maid now, and hath stole from me The chaplet of my fame!—I will not stay! He calls me—mad—too!—I'll not stay an hour! Fergus. Whither wilt thou betake thee, homeless child? Runilda. Hist! hist!—but for our two lives tell it not!— I know a mossy nook the sun-bred winds Visit on wing, like swallows when they cheer Their nestlings with sweet play; it is as warm As Love's breath makes his arbour: from that promontory Where Humber writhes his serpent head to sea, This cave looks forth; and o'er the broadening ooze, Its chalky brows, that gleam against the sun, Beacon the wanderers of the elements Thither for refuge. Thitherward my comrades Are flocking now on salt-wet wing:—They're safe! I see them over-swarm the cliff's bleak head Despite all bluster from the land! Fergus. Thy comrades! Who, under heaven? Runilda. The brood of that proud Raven Under whose hovering darkness is! whose pinion Flaps like a pall, dark standard of old Death!— With them the long-wing'd Seamews troop, spray-speckled, That midland come, prowling the river-banks, Sharp famine in their cry, when Southward driven. Fergus. I guess thy meaning; but art sure of this? Art sure thy friends be there to aid thee? Runilda. Sure! As of one here, to aid me unto them: Thou must hie with me! Fearless for myself Weapon'd as I shall be with harp and skene, 'Tis for thy sake alone thou must come with me. Destruction hangs o'er this king's head, and thine, Flee him and it together! Fergus. Being a hostage So trusted by this unsuspective king, With license large to range as forest deer, How can I break my promise, understood Though never ask'd nor given, not to flee? How stain my princely honour so? Runilda. Then break Thy promise unto me thou would'st be mine Ever and everywhere! Stain thy pure honour Thus—to a princess, not to a baseborn king! Fergus. Sibyl, thy words are spells! Runilda. Listen again: Thou hast my dearest secret, why not this? The fox of kings, the lion-fox, is with us, Wagging his bush for prey; wilt thou not come To shield red-grizzled Constantine? Unfilial! What ties thee here? As Ethelstan bereft Unrightfully thy father of his crown, Bereave him of the pledge he took for it,— Thyself; that is true nature's equity, As our wild laws deliver it—wrong for wrong! Little doth Herva, in Runilda's guise, Owe to this king; he reft me, royal nursling, With wolf's paw from my foster-father's crib, When his fierce litter ravin'd all Northumbria, My state unknown to him; and rear'd me up Forsooth his glee-maid, marking in mine eye Gleams of the gentle craft, through all my sullenness; For woodland airs, sweet brooks, and waterfalls, Had so entuned my soul, that, bred among them, Bird-like, its native speech had needs been song. But what was this fine favour? weighs it even One grain against the globe of ill he wrought me? No! yet, to quiet Conscience, the heart's worm, Most gnawing tenderest natures,—here I promise If this crown'd robber fall, at least for once The gray gull shall not feast on him, the Raven Shall not pluck out his heart:—yea, he shall scape The Wild-cat near his bed, with flame-green eyes Watching his throat lie bare!—will that content thee? Come dallier, come! Fergus. She draws me by the heartstring; 'Twill break if I hold back, and life give with it, Lost to me like my loved-one—I must go!— To leave her under guide of her own wildness, Helpless, yet holding out such baits for harm, Starr'd so with gems, herself pure beauty's pearl,— Impossible! impossible!—Farewell All foresight, prudence, memory, and remorse, Young Wisdom's soft resolves, that melt away Before Love's sunny curls and ardorous smile!— On then! Runilda (opening the orchard gate). Come forth, thou solitary bittern! For ever booming deep, as thou didst swell The hollowest reed i' the vale,—thy hate to man! Enter Bruern. Murmur as low to me—Are the steeds come? Bruern. Down in the bosky dingle, where Eve's shadows Have thicken'd into Night: we've but to skirt it Like bats, and be within the wilds at once. Runilda (to Fergus). This is my harp-bearer— Bruern. Who bears a sword Too, that can make sweet music on a helm As e'er struck up by War-smith! Runilda. Let's begone! Fergus. O what a momentary step it is From safety into peril, weal to woe, From right to wrong!—Who is thy prompter, Maiden, In this most fearful act? Or is it alone Fantasy's lamp thou followest, as a star, When but a gilded vapour? Runilda. Thou'lt hear all As we go on—but first come on!—Ah! faithless— [Exeunt through the orchard gate. SCENE III. An Apartment in the Monastery. Edmund alone, reading a scroll. Edmund. Heavens, am I too, like Edwin, the first Etheling, Mark'd by this jealous and unnatural brother, Down, for immediate death?—Sight-blasting scroll!— (Reads.) —“To Alger, thane. See execution done On Edmund Etheling, forthwith. I, Ethelstan.”— Stamp'd with his private sign! and 'neath his pillow Ready at hand for launching, like a dagger! And left there heedless, to be found by chance, As if he dealt out deaths with such loose hand Often he felt not when men's fates slipp'd from him!— O murderous! monstrous!—Thanks good Prior, thanks, Thy hint came apt. No sleep for me in marble! His majesty shall save in mason work And funeral charges, sackcloth suits, and tears; Fine satisfaction to my ghost forsooth!— What have I done? What has poor Edmund done, Or left undone, that might deserve such doom From this lamb-visaged, tiger-hearted tyrant? This under-scowling simperer! this hypocrite Who smiles and stabs!—this yellow-blooded treacher, Whose eye-whites should, like some gilt, squinting god's, Glisten suspicion, were aught true about him!— Whither shall I betake me? to what wilderness So intricate his bloodhounds shall not track me? Why, 'tis as well turn rebel, if condemn'd To traitor's death when none!—I'll join the plot Our Prior oft hath glanced at, and now urgeth As imminent to succeed, with those brave hearts Who have, since Edwin's fate, stood to their vows Of vengeance against bastard Ethelstan, Self-branded murderer!—yea, self-confess'd!— Ah! can he meditate a twin-like crime To that he mourns so deep?—But doth he mourn?— Dissembler? double-tongued and double-faced! Son of the grand Deceiver! fare thee well. [Exit hastily. SCENE IV. The King's Cabinet. Ethelstan alone. Ethelstan. Lies there on man so dread a penalty As terror to enjoy the boon of sleep? Sleep, in whose cave oblivious sorrow finds Some sanctuary!—Sleep! Nature's best blessing! Doubled, in lieu of other goods denied, Upon the wretched,—all save those like me! O'er him that slays her child, our common Mother Breathes her maternal curse, with bitterest ire,— “My best gift be thy bane,” and it is mine!— Shall I sleep even in the grave? Great Martyr! Let me this crucifixion of the spirit Endure, meek-bowing unto Heaven's decree!— Our monks say—laborare est orare, So to my royal duties. [Sits down at his writing-table. Enter Turketul. Welcome, Chancellor! Bring'st with thee softer breathings from the South Than the sharp North still utters? Our new subjects, Hereabout, live a land-life as unstable Almost as their old ocean one; but Time, Time will assuage the surging of their blood, And soothe the Danish to a steadier flow When mingled with the Saxon. How are my Saxons? Turketul. Well, sire, and wish you “good-heal” with all hearts. Ethelstan. I thank them—Speed their prayer!—What from our East-men? Turketul. Much as their brethren here—Danes will be Danes World over!—break God's peace in heaven itself!— The Devil, I think, and all his Host were Danish! Ethelstan. Thou feel'st with patriotism too raw the ills They have brought on us since Great Alfred's time; Were not our fathers worse Danes to the Britons? Yet then subdued themselves?—Let's all be Englishmen!— Where are the schedules I desired? Turketul. Sir, here. Ethelstan (reading). “Barnstaple Charter, to send burgesses,”— “Sheriffs for bribery or neglect,”—the mulct Is too light on them, double it!—“Every Reeve In every way shall furnish one poor man, If any such be had, or can be found.”— That, that's my glory as a Lawgiver! Turketul. True, sire; the proudest office to a king,— General Purveyor for his poor. Ethelstan. No, chancellor, But Ethelstan's proud honour in this law, Best proof of his paternal governance, Is that it notes—the poor man “must be found:” He came unsought when I began to reign! Turketul. Beggars are rare, no doubt,—but 'tis among Your Saxons, sire! Ethelstan. In this and everything, I tell you, we'll be Saxons all ere long: My kingdom now is one, compact, and round, To make it which my several wars have tended, As their great aim and good. Enough of that.— My library, you've brought it safe? no volume Lost or forgot? Turketul. 'Tis safer than myself, Who have lost somewhat of my girth's full volume, Riding and baiting not!—The store of books Is safe at hand. Ethelstan. Good! let me see it. Turketul (to the Guard). Ho there! Ethelstan. I have sigh'd for them oft—oft— [A small Book-case brought in. My best solacers! Mute speakers to my heart! my steadiest friends! Pillow companions! Fountains whence I draw Truth purest, deepest counsel! O my comforts— Are ye all here? Ethelstan's Royal Library! Treasure unparallel'd!—Let's see: my Grammar— My Alcuin—Donatus Major—and Minor— Apocalypsis—two Art Metricals— Gloss upon Cato—De Natura Rerum— All! this is well! Turketul. Truly so large collection Beseems so learned a king. Ethelstan. It is my vanity! In books alone am I a spendthrift, sir! Few, save the French king, I do flatter me, Have such voluminous treasure of the mind Heap'd up, so rich, so precious! Leave me, Chancellor, I pr'ythee, to the bliss of sweet discourse With these soul-gladdeners— Enter Goderic hastily. How now, thane? Goderic. 'Tis rumour'd Prince Fergus, sire, is fled, and the Glee-maiden. Ethelstan. Fled!—whither should they fly?—for what?—Good thane, Send out some trackers. Goderic. They are sent, my liege, This moment spurr'd.— Ethelstan. Fool boy! wild girl!—But fled? Why think you they are fled? who saw them flying?— Save to the greenwood, like a turtle pair For privacy—most modest when most amorous? I thought the Girl too proud for that; but Song Intoxicates us through the ear, and presently Our staggering virtue falls!—who saw them flying? Goderic. It is but rumour yet. Turketul. Now I remember me, When near the gate, swift by my left swept past Three hair-brain'd riders; among whom the hindmost Alone, the brief dusk moment let me mark: I knew him by the brand which Nature set 'Tween his dark brows to stamp him for a felon; His calling struck me, though not what he calls him,— 'Twas that same Sword-bearer, condemn'd to drown But saved—to drier suffocation born! Ethelstan. What! he released of late from sanctuary? A pale brow—all o'er-bristled with black hairs— Deep, straight-down wrinkles? Turketul. Gullies! Ethelstan. Limbs distort With strength, like oaken boughs—his knees upon them Gnarl'd, as it were—and huge hands—had he not? Turketul. Exact. Ethelstan. Ha, Bruern! Dared he lurk here still? That bodes no good!—'Twas your said knave, than whom The stormy bird which shipmen petrel name, No more foretels the dangerous time it loves; Even when I freed him, he scarce raised his brow, But eyed me sulkily as an ox turn'd loose: Is he not Danish! Turketul. Verily I think He's one of the Black Strangers! Ethelstan. Humph! Enter Prince Haco. Well, Haco? Thou wilt not, Scanian, leave me like the Scot? Dishonourable youth! who hath stol'n from me His person pledged, and my bird-maiden too; Beguiling the strange witlessness of genius Which can see knavery through, though not a knave! Haco. I'm sad almost to tears, your grace! Ethelstan. Why comes not Childe Edmund, with bright filial looks to cheer me? Told you him that I ask'd? Haco. I did, your grace: He answer'd—nought. Ethelstan. Ay! more ingratitude? Thou hid'st the worst of it!—Well, since he comes not, The king shall go to him!—(To Goderic) Search thoroughly! [Exeunt omnes. SCENE V. The Woods. Enter Edmund disguised. Edmund. Can I reach Fredda-thorpe my 'scape is sure: That's but a steed's swift flight across the wolds Into St. Cuthbert's Franchise; thence not far To Carleol, where the Cumbrian king resides, And many a thane and warlike elderman Keep firm-set shoulder, back'd by him, against This tyrant, in the Westmere fastnesses; Their people, half Welsh and whole rebel, think Their bread most sweet when crush'd from blood-red corn, And fight like Irish kerns for idle humour: Better go there and live, than stay and die! [Exit. SCENE VI. The Cloisters. Ellisif, Prior, and a Messenger. Ellisif. Nay he shall know it, Prior! and at once; 'Twill soon be learn'd else-how; so let me seem The first to have heard this sudden tempest rising: I shall be thank'd for my solicitude. Prior. Lips that, howe'er so honied, bring bad news, Are touch'd with wormwood by it; he will hate thee! Ellisif. Ah! this stout fellow here shall bear it all, Then I'll step in as soother. Say thou comest From Maiden Ellisif, all haste and terror, What shall betide him: be much out of breath, And stretch your neck forth with the horrible news; Let fear give worse intelligence through your eyes, Make pale your lips, and so bechalk your cheeks That he shall stare as wild!—Go, you've the trick of it! [Exit Messenger. Prior. 'Twill give his grace the ear-ache for a time! Ellisif. 'Twill be a thunderbolt! he will stand, after it, Like the scathed oak, a rind of lingering life, Within—a pillar of ashes! Prior. Such a blow Must of needs prostrate him, that has received One worse than other from thy hand but now. Ellisif. You know not all! You know not all!—Stay, stay! Prior. Prince Edmund's flight struck deep. Will he hold up? Methinks I see him, haggard—wan of hue— His twisted locks self-loosing them—his eyes Cast wildly earthward, seeking out his grave! A man's but heated clay when he's heart-broken. Ellisif. Ethelstan?—he heart-broken?—if it be so, For his dread sins, his crimes damnation-deep, Upon the wheel of Conscience hath his heart Been broken! and by that fell ratchet torn In trembling mutilation scarce survives! Ay! there he stands, fiend-haunted! thinking how From hundred-handed Vengeance he shall scape Haply through death's dark loophole— Prior. 'Tis a way! Ellisif. Yet fears to drop into the chasm beneath Lest a worse Torturer seize him!—O he dream'd Again, last evening, such another dream! Prior. Why not relieve him now from life so burdensome? He cannot well fare worse, whate'er he fears. Ellisif. No gentle Prior! he must live to help me, Despite himself, else other friends might bustle them Between my goal and me. I hope this news Will not prove apoplectic to his stoutness: Now will I go, and be his—comforter! [Exit. Prior. Kind Lady!—To what depth of guile, of guilt, Will disappointed love, blasted ambition, Lead that fair devil some call—angel Woman! [Exit. SCENE VII. A Chamber at the Nunnery. Edgitha sick on a couch. Nuns and two Monk-physicians attending. Edgitha. Is the King come?—My breath grows fainter still— I shall not live to see him. Enter Ethelstan. Ethelstan. Must I lose all? And thee, for ever—without hope—my Sister? Edgitha. Heaven's will be done! 'tis better than our wishes! Let me, kind daughters, reverend leeches, pray Your leaves awhile— Physician. She is long past our serving: Angels tend on her now, she's in their arms! [Exeunt Nuns and Physicians. Ethelstan. Whence this so sudden fate? Edgitha. Of little moment, Since it is fate!—Sit down by me, dear Brother, And let me smoothe thy pale, broad brow once more, Be my hand not too chill.—Ah! what is here? Has Death's dim curtain fallen before mine eyes Already, that thou look'st so wan, so faded? Ethelstan. Wilt leave me—me thus grief-worn? Edgitha. O you heavens! His hair is gray! in one short night turn'd gray From golden!—O God! God! what he has suffer'd, That this should be!—Why he looks old enough To be the father of his years! Ethelstan. I've had An ill night—nothing worse— Edgitha. Worse, worse, far worse Than even thy death-struck sister, Ethelstan! Thou art too silent of thy griefs,—it kills thee! Ah! thou wilt want me soon!—Hadst thou a friend, One woman-friend to cheer thee, when I'm gone! 'Tis my chief pain in dying! Ethelstan. What's in thy heart, Thou look'st so steadfast on me? Edgitha. Maiden Ellisif Is child of traitor Alfred! Ethelstan. Alfred thane. Edgitha. Traitor he was, Heaven spoke it!—Is she true?— Doth not the basilisk beget the basilisk? Flows balm from henbane? or do innocent doves Hatch in the shells of crocodiles?—I speak Now with a voice authentic as the dead, Whose fixed features can mask truth no more! Temp'rate, tongue-charitable, was I ever; To bear false witness now, were at heaven's gate To fling a broken tablet of the Law, Yet think to enter!—With this dying breath, Beware of Maiden Ellisif! Ethelstan. My Queen, My Wife, elect? my earliest love that was, My latest that shall be? whose graven image Will hold its print on this idolatrous heart When crumbled into dust? Edgitha. And, like idolatry, Be punish'd sore! Ethelstan. O Sister, say not, say not She's faithless! Edgitha. Thou hast had thy Warning Voice From the tomb-brink itself! Ethelstan. Mean'st thou of Edwin's? Edgitha. I have no breath for policy—She hates thee! She hates us both, me because Love's soft scarf Blinded not these poor eyes, that have seen through her: We women—yea, the simplest of us all— Are keen heart-searchers, specially of women. When we last greeted, she did wind about me Her cold, smooth form, as if a snake embraced me And fain would strangle— Ethelstan. Ah! no more, no more! Speak of thyself: how feel'st? Edgitha. Dead—I am poison'd! Ethelstan. Poison'd? Edgitha. Find out by whom—I pray thee find it When Edgitha 's no more; not to avenge her, But to find what fell traitress sits so near thee. Ethelstan. 'Tis a she-devil then, thou 'rt sure of that? Thy Nuns shall take the fiery test— Edgitha. Ah, spare them! They are as innocent of it, as the flock Of their dumb mother's death upon the shambles.— Look to the Novices!—Now call my servants. Ethelstan. It turns my heart-blood cold to think it so! It is too horrible!— Edgitha. Pray, draw the curtain— Scene closes. SCENE VIII. The King's Cabinet. Enter Ethelstan. Ethelstan. How many deaths we die with those we love Who sink before us!—death of pang severer Than is our own departure,—oft small pain! How many living deaths do we endure, Our friendships, our affections kill'd, in which We had our best of being!—'Twas the lot Our little ignorant hands drew when we groped, Blind embryons, in nature's darkling bosom, For that sad prize—long life!—That I had died When I loved nought beyond my mother's breast And it, not for her sake, but its sweet nourishment! O Heaven! what misanthropes would make of us, Kindliness ill-requited!—blood turns gall, Hearts become spleens, and we grow even to hate God's fairest image, in its feminine form, That creature which all earthly goodness seem'd To breathe in, as a pure and beautiful shrine For earthly love 's best worship!—Can it be That this bright shape angelical should prove A demon's house within?—I am the mariner On a strange sea, with every storm that blows Whirling me every way, yet leaving me The piece of still distraction that I stood, Not knowing which to move with.—Now, what 's here? Enter Turketul, Alger, Goderic, and other Chiefs; the Prior and Messenger. Turketul. A messenger, who says he bears dread news To king and kingdom! Ethelstan. Whence? from whom? Messenger. Her Grace, The queen presumptive, who, all haste and terror What may betide her liege, sends word:—The Danes, Fierce Anlaf at their front, and host on host At flank and rear—the ever-dangerous Irish— Cambrians, Cumbrians, led by Edwal, Eogan,— Northmen by Harald Blue-Tooth's warlike son— Picts and Orcadians—with his Albin-Scots, Grey Constantine—the pirate-bands colleagued Under their Sea-kings by strong hope of spoil— These piled on others, hundreds of deep-hull'd ships Whose emptiest weight makes ocean mount the shores, Disgorge at Humber-mouth, as if the sea Its multitudinous monsters turn'd to men, And cast them shoal on shoal upon our Isle! Ethelstan. Thank heaven!—this breathes new life in me!—thank heaven! Chancellor, southward, and bring up my Saxons— You, Goderic, Alger, thanes, stand the foe here With your stout countrymen—I will to York Where my guards lie prompt for this imminence— Away!—Come soon to conquest!—You, bold Prior, Be rife with our good men of Beverley To back these warlike thanes—I know your citizens! Men made of rock!—So there, my armour, knights!— Unhappy Edmund! Danes upon the field, And thou not!—leaving all the joy of battle To Ethelstan alone! [Exit. Prior. So speeds our thunderbolt! SCENE IX. The Danish Camp, with the Reafen standard flying. Anlaf, Constantine, Edwal, Froda, Gorm, Fergus, Runilda. Sea-kings, Chiefs, and Soldiers. Constantine. Were it not well, sage Kings and prudent Yarls, Our fluttering host at length flock'd round the Reafen, Into some order? A wild flight of swans Or geese, methinks, hath more! Anlaf. A stirring scene, In sooth, gray sire; it moves yet fixes still My glorying soul and gaze!—What would you have? The swing of the billows must go out of us Ere we can steady us!—A tide of men! Lo! how the living deluge sinks and swells, Down slope—up steep—bursting away bytimes O'er rock or hill, like black floods fringed with foam, And with an angrier murmur! To my ear 'Tis sweet as amorous coo of coupling doves! Believe me it looks well: I like to mark These children of the Sea-mew and the Raven Settling uneasily on such rich fields Full of their larger purpose to seize all,— Not fixing, poor tame fowl! on first-come farm. Gorm. And I!—Ho, how my heart bounds in my bosom, Mine eyes burn in their caverns for great joy To think of striding these broad cultures o'er, And strewing them with limbs! Constantine (looking forth). Who are those heroes I see with plumeless helms? Gorm. Jomsburgers all!— We know not fear, they not the name of it! Constantine. Ay: they've just slaughter'd to a man, I see, Those Welsh-kin, at a struggle for some kine. Gorm. By Thor, good strikers! it was quickly done! Edwal (drawing). My Britons slain?—help, Cymri! Gorm (drawing). All Sea-riders, Help the sea-city of Jomsburg!—Havoc! havoc! Anlaf. Hold!—who to quarrel moves one step, I send The lightning of this sword-flash through his heart!— How shall we prosper, noble chiefs and princes, 'Gainst Ethelstan, war-crafty as he is, If thus, when we should fall like mountains on him, Hurtling we crush ourselves to dust? O shame! Gorm. Why, let's fall on, then—somewhere, if not here! Froda. Whither speed first? Anlaf. Wherefore not straight to York, Deem'd by my father, Sihtric, and the Danes, Mid-fortress of their kingdom? Gorm. On then—on! Constantine. Green wit for once jumps with grey wisdom: Ay! No elsewhere than to York. Runilda (coming forward). Anywhere else! A shower of blood hangs in that crimson sky, Which our own thunder would bring down upon us! Go elsewhere than to York! The Dragon's there!— Listen and learn: [She chants to the harp. The knot in the trunk Is the tough of the tree! The bale of the barque Is the breaker at sea! The fortress in fight Ever keepeth the field! The Dragon's at York Who yet never would yield! Go not to York, I say! Anlaf. Hear our young prophetess! Froda. Hear dark-eyed Herva! Gorm. Hear King Ella's daughter! (Kneeling) Gorm to the bright divinity in woman That shines on heroes, bends his iron knee!— Whither wouldst have us wing? where is our prey? Runilda (chanting). Go where the wild Bear-seekers go! Where the wild winds bleaker blow! Go where paler springs the corn! Where more pale doth spring the Morn! Northman's still Northumbria land! Northumbria shall to Northman stand; There shall aye the Reafen hover, His wings broad-shadow him on the ground, All that his black shape shall cover, Be his, while earth the sun goes round!— To North!—by far-off axes hewn I hear the groaning forests fall, Forests of men, in ranks bestrewn, Northward! to north, ye Northmen all! Several. Northward! north! north! Constantine. Doth it so well become Grown men to take a rapturous girl for guide? Runilda (chanting). Gray head! get thee gone thy best gate with thy Gael to the Grampians! Woe waits thee, deep heart-wounds, as wise as thou art and as warlike! The blood-drinking barb bends her way to the breast of the bright-hair'd! The spear speedeth swift on the wind to the wound, her red station! Each moment, to man the misguided, is mother of mourning! Anlaf. How sweet she rings the letter through her rhyme, With double, treble tricks of curious art, In every stave!—She hath the gift of Song Better than any Skalld! Froda. Most sure, inspired! Constantine. Well, let us northward; you'll be nearer friends. Gorm. Let's sweep along the coast, that so our plunder In the brown-bosom'd ships may glide beside us. Anlaf. To horse then!—Pluck the Reafen from her perch! [It is brought forward. Thou ravager of earth! grant us good spoil,— Ethelstan, rich in bracelets, and his host Bright with his goldenness that shines on all!— To horse, ye Danish Riders! let the ground Thunder beneath our steeds, till this whole land Shake inwardly! that he alone, Usurper, Whilst his men fly him, shall stand fix'd in fear, Till the black war-cloud bursts upon his head,— Then be no further found when all is still! Northward! [Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A Forest on the way to Brunanburh. Enter Ethelstan, with House-carls. Ethelstan. Pleasant, in these dim woods where Quiet dwells, To hold sweet under-talk with her, whose voice Spirit-like, whispers us beneath the boughs, Herself unseen! Pleasant with light foot-fall To press rich Autumn's bed of russet leaves, Make the warm-smelling moss give out its odour, And here, unbonneted, in sunless noon, Drink the green air, refreshing both to sense And soul world-wearied!—Blest the Woodman sure Who lives his lusty life out here, and whistles it Lark-like away, the blither nearer heaven! Perchance he hath his hut among these bowers, His wife beloved and babe?—some one that smiles Cheer thee! when drooping he goes home at eve— But Ethelstan! crown'd Ethelstan!— We linger, fellows! By St. John Beverley we're all entranced! O I could still my beating heart to hear That gentle bird's grove-buried song!—Away! Our fortunes will slide from us if we stay! Enter a House-carl. House-carl. My liege, the followers report just now A prisoner of price. Ethelstan. Bring him before us. Enter House-carls with Prisoner. What runagate art thou? that when the foes Thicken about us, tak'st that coward time Thus to desert thy country and thy king?— Some wretch, half-Dane, all traitor? Prisoner. A true Saxon! Wretch enough to be born thy brother! [Throws off his disguise. Ethelstan. Edmund! Childe Edmund!—to my heart! No, I'll not clasp thee; Thou art a froward boy that must be taught By rigour and restraint.—Leave us! [Exeunt House-carls. Ungrateful! Have I not shown a father's gravest care, Mix'd with a mother's mildest, ever for thee? And yet thou'lt play the sullen with me thus, The truant, yea the o'er-grown micher!—Wherefore? Because I check'd thee gently for thy good Some days since! Edmund. I confess that—but— Ethelstan. But folly! Be wiser for thyself another time; It might have cost thee blood—the Dane's upon us! I want thee, Edmund—All's forgiven, forgot! Thou 'rt my right arm again!—Come hither, lad: These supple kinsmen of the galloping waves Will soon o'er-ride Northumbria—that's their custom! Thou must with some few men hang on their rear To hold them back; hie swift to Derwent stream— Cross by the windmill's boat— Edmund (falling on his knees). Spare me! O spare me! Why should poor, guiltless Edmund thus be sent To his cold grave so soon? Ethelstan. Soon? at these years? When for a Saxon was it ever “soon,”— Most for a kinsman of Great Alfred, “soon,”— To die defending Mother-land?—I never Thought thee unworthy of thy race before! Edmund. Unworthy is it then to wish me drown'd In Danish blood rather than Derwent stream? [Giving the Death Warrant. Ethelstan. Ha! treachery!—domestic treachery!— How was this seal'd?—Who has been at my pillow?— True Edgitha,—from traitors traitresses!— And yet the Maiden may explain—I'll write to her, I will not see her,—on that side I'm weak!— Edmund, here is my dagger, here my breast, Strike if thou fear'st me, Childe!—Strike, and be king! Edmund (embracing him). Best father! brother loved! dear liege! O pardon me! (Starting up.) Thou said'st by boat—the Derwent stream—farewell! [Exit. Ethelstan. Royal-soul'd Edmund!—No! they shall not make thee Hate me; I will not suffer them do that! A little o'er-suspicious art thou, Edmund; Dim-vision'd! for clear-sighted men see where Danger is not, as well as where it is, Have owl and eagle eyes to see in the dark And daylight both.—Yet, verily, thou hadst Some cause!—O Woman, heaven's own daughter or hell's! [Exit. SCENE II. A Road. Troops upon their march. Enter Ellisif, Alger, and the Prior. Ellisif. Both have done well: ye lost the fight, yet saved Your credits with the king. Prior. My promised bishopric, I hope too, lady? Ellisif. There's no danger of it: Ye shall stand higher still when I am queen. Alger. With deference, there may come a doubt— Ellisif. None! none! If, from brute prejudice 'gainst female sway, The Wessex crown cannot by law descend, As it is worded, to the spindle side, Why then, my charms of person and of power Shall win young Edmund, or some other sprout From the root royal, who shall king it under me. Edmund I trust hath join'd our Cumbrian friends, And hastes them to our aid: then all were sure! Alger. Yes, had not Ethelstan been let live on. Ellisif. That was ill luck; I kept him as a poise To Anlaf, needful after victory, For 't was but playing one against the other Could make my game safe. I had good hope too, Still to have led him blindfold, but some chance Hath shaken him from his unsuspiciousness. We cannot scape ill-luck, though we may cure it: I have a stratagem in store for him He wots not of, that might redeem it all; Between my sword and Anlaf's he is slain! Prior. And then we use Prince Edmund as the poise, Or t'other royal sprout—is it not so? Ellisif. So. Now let's on, as we agreed, to fill Our parts allotted in this final scene: Courage!—risk nought, nought win! We risk but breath— Mere life, and may win all that makes life glorious! [Exeunt. SCENE III. Ethelstan's Tent. A Banquet set forth. Ethelstan, Turketul, Haco, Egil Skillagrym with a harp, and other guests. Ethelstan. Send round the harp! Each chief awake its strain!— Churl in his soul, whose voice and hand unskill'd Aids not the circling glee!—Send round the horn Foam-crested! the blithe harp's companion boon! High-fill'd with amber mead, rich ale, bright wine! Let both the festive shells go swiftly round, That we may drink at once the double sweetness Through lip and ear!—raise the dead spirit of joy, And charm the serpents of the heart to sleep, Or if not, drown them!—(To Egil.) By thee, noble stranger, Have harp and horn, and host, been honour'd deeply! From thy rapt lay, blown locks, and heaven-ward eye, Thou must be some famed minstrel? Egil. A Sea-king! Who midst the idle rattle of the shrouds Oft listening to the lonely Merman's song, Found a sad cheer in it, and learn'd like him To make society in my sea-solitude With mine own voice, that aye from cliff and wave Leap'd back to me in Echo's lovelier form! So I grew up what Northmen name a Skalld, Southrons a Sceop, or shaper of verse, a poet,— Soul-fraught with lightsome burden of all rhymes! Warrior and Minstrel thus, I, at the sound Of that loud trump, Glory's bright blazoner, Which blows through all the worlds,—hearing it swell Thy fame, great Ethelstan, the Bracelet-giver! Bravest and best of kings! and that thou sought'st From ablest hands their iron aid,—at once I stood before thee, Egil Skillagrym! Ethelstan. He that slew fierce King Eric's son, and gain'd His “Ransom” from grim Vengeance by a Song? Egil. Even he!—Such virtue in good minstrelling!— I slew him a brace of kin beside his son! Ethelstan. Welcome! as wild swan to the snowy brood, Helping them buffet with the ocean wind!— Accept this bracelet gemm'd, and these two cabinets Fill'd with pure silver. Thou shalt have command. Egil. More, generous king!—let it be in the front, So I may use stout voice and glaive together, Raising the war-song, smiting down the foe! Ethelstan. As thou wilt, gallant bard!—Now, Chancellor, A Saxon rhyme! Turketul. I've a rough stave or two Which had been well before the Northman sung, But now 'twill sound too homely. Ne'ertheless— Enter Messenger, with a letter. Ethelstan. Pardon me, friends—Chancellor, fill my chair. (To the Messenger.) You brought me screech-owl news before; is this Of the same tenor?—for I need it not; Mine enemies are now within my reach, That which a brave man only wants!—Come hither. [Exit with Messenger. Scene changes to another part of the Tent. Enter Ethelstan, reading a letter. “I am too proud to defend me against suspicions, or foul accusations: the breath of the dying is seldom sweet.”— True! when they are poisoned!—How should she tell my Sister accused her, unless feeling its likelihood?—Well: “But were you not blinded by aversion now, as some while since by love,”—Ha! So I was blinded by love?—“you would see the committer of both these crimes in her who has fled, fearing trial, rather than in her who remains to dare it—in the young she-wolf Runilda, rather than in the still, to thee, tender-hearted—Ellisif.” Runilda? what! my little wild glee-maiden! It is not like the creature!—a frank thing, Whose candid blood, as passion comes and goes, Speaks vividly in her colouring brow and cheek; But for cold truculence, considerate treason, As fit as unfal'n angel for a fiend! Odd! is it not, how near are friend and fiend? When I say “friend,” I stutter into “fiend;” There's but a burring consonant between them! Add the dog-letter, fiend is friend! I toy With my embosom'd viper. Stay, a postscript:— “Herewith I send thy brother Edwin's well-known sword, first to fulfil thy often-heard wish for that famous relic; secondly, as a proof who is the traitress, this weapon having been found by her pursuers, which they on oath can attest. Some of them who visited, as spies, the Danish tents, avouch that Runilda and her paramour, Fergus, are there: Anlaf is her uncle.” Anlaf her uncle! And her attendant, Bruern, My brother's sword-bearer! these do point at her. Could the dark spirit of the Dane come o'er The lustre of the cherub that was in her, Blackening it thus? Or was my petted she-wolf Tame and caressable till her claws were grown, Then treacherous to her fondler through dire faithfulness To the o'ermastering savage in her blood? Anlaf her uncle!—he, too, hath his spies Doubtless abroad; have they into her soul Whisper'd their villanous minds, contributing Every one, the foul devils that possess'd him, To fill her with a legion? Woful thoughts! Yet it may be so! Fain would my belief Take part with my affections, wishes, hopes, All strong for Ellisif still! Wretched credulity! O there's internal war 'gainst which the state Of my divided self cannot stand long! Away! I must put heart into all others, Though sorrow and care eat up mine own!—To banquet! [Exit. Scene as before the last. Guests as before. Anlaf disguised as a Harper. Turketul (to Anlaf). Rest here: the King will come anon. Anlaf. I saw The Wessex Dragon glittering o'er the tent, And guess'd his royal brood lay under it! Ethelstan king, loves he the minstrel-art? Turketul. Nought better, save the Laws and written lore It is a proverb with us, “No one ever Hath ruled more legally or more learnedly.” He comes, his armour lights the doorway.— Enter Ethelstan. Anlaf (to himself). Gorgeously, As a torch borne before him: that 's my prize, When I tread on his breast!—He holds him well, Slim-flank'd, but ample-chested as my steed, Neck firm enough to bear a hundred crowns, Had he usurp'd them! I shall smile to humble That front of war he wears, yet, Saxon-like, So placid in its pride!—Ay, are the tresses That gave, 'twas said, such lustre to the air,— That down his shoulders flow'd as rich as sands Down golden channels,—are they blanch'd thus early? All's one!—they'll soon be tinged!—He marks me not. Haco. Patience! his full tense eye looking so far At his great objects can but ill discern The petty things beside him. Ethelstan. Pardon my absence Even when in your presence, princely friends! A new bard-militant? a sea-king, ha? Anlaf. Sea-rover, in good truth! soldier, and singer! Ethelstan. Give him a cup of the king's wine. Let's have A sample of thy mystery. Anlaf. What mystery? Ethelstan. Why, of thy song-craft!—We ne'er doubt thee, friend, A well-skill'd cleaver of shields and billows too, Thou look'st so tall a fellow, and art limb'd So answerably to thy active eye, As hawk's quick glance doth suit his eager talons, That grasp their perch like prey. What takes thy mind? Anlaf. My thoughts were wandering—only for a theme— Ethelstan. And the grand kindred of Great Alfred by? Anlaf. True!—Alfred is an apposite theme—O dullard!— I am unused to sing—for Saxon ears— Bear with me, pray you!—'Tis a simple rhyme. [Chanting to his harp. From Athelney's Island Deep-sunk in the forest, By deserts defended, By moor and by marish: Haunt of the wild foxes! Home of the catamount! Fresh-water haven For war-shatter'd Saxons! From Athelney's Island The Danes camping round it, And feasting, carousing, And dicing, and chaunting, Forgetfully dreaming The wolf when he sleepeth The prey never gaineth; And the bird of Oblivion Sings still by the drinkers Their souls away stealing! From Athelney's Island Steals forth hidden Alfred, The monarch a minstrel! His cloak o'er his armour, The cloud of its brightness! His harp-touches sparkle Like sunbeams that sprinkle The breast of the water! He strikes his cords shriller Lest his mail be heard tingle! From Athelney's Island To the banquet, wolf-starven, Both maw and eye-hungry, He comes, noble Alfred, Ever keen, ever watchful, For all he might gather That fell from king Guthrum Or lay round about him. Then to Athelney's Island With maw and eye-plunder, He hastes him, the crafty, The minstrel now monarch! And soon it bested him At Ethandune battle, Where he pluck'd the dark Reafen Of half her broad pinion! Fierce Alfred, the minstrel, The crafty, the valiant, The grandsire renowned Of Ethelstan, dragon! The pride of the Saxons! The star of their glory! And theme of Earth's vessel That floats upon Ages! Egil. A lay well sung, and sure extemporal! (To Turketul aside) 'Twas slight enough in art—one see-saw chime!— No counter-change!—no quaint alliteration!— But that we're bound to praise a brother-bard, I'd say those sinewy fingers oftener twang'd The bow's string than the harp's! Turketul. Is he not Danish? Egil. He hath the accent. Turketul. Truly a vile screamer! He'd scare a rookery—the very nests Would take wing!—'Mongst the croaking tribe, I grant, His voice had borne the prize from all the bog! Ethelstan (to Anlaf). Put up thy gifts. Go, if thou wilt, and whither: Song, the best form of thought, should be most free! Anlaf. Thanks, liberal sir!—I will return bytimes, And rouse you with another kind of music! [Exit. Ethelstan. Now princes, thanes, and chieftains, let me, father-like, Dismiss ye to your rest: get vigour from it For the morn's victory! we must be stirring With dawn, like game-cocks, lest these gulls and ravens Should seem more birds of the sun than we, and thence Strut braver up to us:—good night!—I'll forth Upon my rounds: an hour ere day-light, warriors, Be all here ready-arm'd!—Stay, Alger, Thorwolf, You, of the van, leaders with Egil king, Take these next tents: sleep soundly! never Morn, Blithe ruffler, blew her trumpet half so shrill, As my loud battle-call shall wake ye up Unto this day of triumph!—Brief good night!— Come with me, Haco! SCENE IV. The Saxon Camp. A Sentinel behind. Moonlight. Enter Anlaf: he looks cautiously round, cuts a sod from the earth, and buries under it the gifts he has received from Ethelstan: then departs. After a time, enter Ethelstan and Haco. Ethelstan. How peacefully yon Moon enjoys her reign, No rival mooting it, till she descends Of her own will, and yields her studded throne To her heaven-sanction'd heritor!—How smooth And green is this fresh sward, which by to-morrow Will be dug rough with hoofs, and plough'd with spears, And stain'd with rueful purple! O War, war, Thou stern amusement of ambitious minds! Have I loved thee too well, and not the cause That hallows thee,—succeeding honour and peace?— (To the Sentinel.) How goes it, soldier? All seems quiet here? Sentinel. Yes, sire, and will remain so, since our enemies Come to our camp, and mix with us as friends! Haco. What means the churl to speak so blunt to kings? Sentinel. I mean that Anlaf Dane hath been among us, Taking his note of where and how we lie, Fox, wolf, and lurcher,—all in one! Ethelstan. King Anlaf? Sentinel. That same, my liege; he pass'd but now by me. Haco. Rare cowardice! this fellow's fear creates A shadowy foe, of moonshine! Ethelstan. Patience, Haco!— Why shouldst thou make thyself suspected, friend, By such a proofless story and improbable? Sentinel. Here is my proof— [Dashing his battle-axe into the earth, money and jewels fly up. Doth that look probable? Ethelstan. They are my very gifts to that false Harper! Sentinel. He came, and as he would shake reptiles off That clung to him with odious love, he tosses These precious things to earth—spurns them—and tramples them— Then scores me up the turf, and treads them into it!— Looks not this like King Anlaf?—Nay, I knew him! Ethelstan. Thou shouldst have seized him then: where was thy loyalty? Sentinel. That oath I've ta'en to thee I took to Anlaf When he was king of Dane-law; had I now Betray'd him, I might do as much by thee! Ethelstan. Answer'd!—Have these for part-reward. [Pointing to the gifts. Sentinel. If churls Dare speak thus with a king, I would advise him To shift his tent into some other quarter. Haco. 'Twere well, your grace!—The Dane hath mark'd it, sure, For some fierce onslaught. Ethelstan. No—no—let it stand.— (To the Sentinel.) I'll not forget thee and thy twofold faith: Good night!—Keep steady watch until relieved.— (To himself.) We'll let the tent stand, with the Dragon over it: Yon Prior, Edmund tells me of, his friend, And friend of every mal-content i' the kingdom, Yon bishop-elect of Shirebourne, hath a friendship With Maiden Ellisif too—'twas she elected him!— Which thickens more the dark, foul cloud around her: His sanctity has just arrived, it seems, In the rear of all his men, to slip off sideways When battle joins; he shall have my pavilion, So will be royally lodged! and should the Danes Sack it, why he's the sooner with his friends!— Come, goshawk! [Exeunt Ethelstan and Haco. SCENE V. A Tent in the Danish Camp at Brunanburh. Armour and Arms. Fergus, and Runilda arming him for battle. Runilda. There! it droops well!—O how his plume becomes him, As the proud-bending pine the promontory!— And yet methinks it droops too much—it should not Shade his blue eyes from sight!—Now, is it better? Dost feel it sway, with pleasant heaviness, Nobly upon thy brow? Will it do thus? Fergus. I should say—ay, and yet would fain say—no, To keep thy sweet hands still about my face, Thy delicate fingers touching me like tendrils Which, 'mid the honeysuckle bowers, I've felt Softly yet fondly o'er my forehead play!— How blissful thus— Runilda. His chin! gods, gods, his chin! A broader, braver ribbon under it! Fergus. Thus in mine arms to hold thee, while thou peer'st Closely o'er all my looks, as they were far More precious than thine own and more thy pride! To feel the halo of thy breath around me When thy lips part to speak, thou living rose Grafted into a lily!—Wherefore that sigh? Runilda. Ah me! now thou art deck'd with mine own care, I could sit down and weep to send thee forth In all thy gallantry and grace, so trim, So beautiful, so blooming-young, to battle! Fergus. Herva, wilt turn my flush of pride to shame, With fears I am too much a tenderling For war's rough pastime,—nought but a male doll To be dress'd up and kiss'd?—Do heroines weep? Runilda. Well, I will sing— Bright-hair'd Halmar took his bow, And he bounded blithe o'er the fields of snow; But the Storm-King whirl'd him in a wreath, Where he lies as stark as his shaft in the sheath! Here is your lance—and target— Fergus. But my gloves? Until my hands be rough-shod, all slips from them; My gloves, sweet Armourer! Runilda. Not yet—not yet— Ere they be on thou must in turn arm me. Fergus. Thee? thee?—O madness! thou arm for the battle? A mere slight girl! whole winters yet from womanhood! Runilda. Nay, martial sir, thou'rt but a stripling too!— Come, arm me! arm me!—Am I not thine to death? Fergus. What are these little moulds of panoply Thou lay'st before me,—hauberk, helm, and greave?— Pity, O pity, do not put them on! Runilda (chants as she arms). Then Odin's dark Daughters rode over the plain, Chiding on the slow slaughter and chusing the slain! Cries Gondula, fixing her smile on the fight, ‘Ye'll join hands in the Hall of Dead Heroes to-night!’ Fergus. Look at this toy of helmets!—'tis too thin, Too frail, to bear the stroke of Mercy's sword, Though that mild chastener would warn, not harm thee! What's here? Runilda. My brand! Fergus. O heaven, 'tis scarce a dagger To fence away the fate those Saxon deathsmen Deal with two-handed glaives!—Here is a targe! One spangle on huge Turketul's shield! fit thing To breast the shock of bucklers, when together Ranks fall like walls in earthquakes, and at once Rises the hill of ruin!—Here, look here, A wrist to stem that mighty brunt!—brave wrist! Thick as a swan's neck, and as white and bendable! Why, in his steely embrace, War's softest pressure Would crush thy soul out! Runilda. Wert thou half as safe! This armour, Dwarfs in Hecla's smithy forged: See! the lines graven round it all are Runes— Mystic inscriptions, full of wizard power To ward off ill: I am not vulnerable,— Except by grief!—My soul is very sad!— What sound is that without? Fergus. Trampling of steeds. Runilda. Why doth the Night-mare whinny so loud? Her heavy knees trample the groaning-one deeper! Her flurried black mane like a thunder-cloud Flickers forth serpents of fire o'er the sleeper! How he writhes him beneath her, The blue flame breather! And his eyes wild staring At hers wilder glaring! Mark how they glow in their sockets without flashes, Two gray bale-fires mouldering in their ashes! Fergus. Cease! cease!—No death-cry terrible as this! Hear you that signal? [A low war-whistle without. Runilda. It thrills through my marrow! Fergus. And my glad heart—if thou wouldst but stay here?— Come, since it must be so! Runilda, Ay, with my harp! See how I fling it gallant o'er my shoulder, As if we tripp'd to banquet!—So we do! The banquet of the eagle and the raven, Where they shall have their glut!—Come, my sweet harp, Echo the warrior's shout and drown his wail And chant his death-song!—Come, to battle! battle!

Enter Anlaf, Edwal, Froda, Gorm, and the Reafen-bearer with other Danes. Anlaf. Forward, ye warriors!—Shall they beat us off Like drones, when we had storm'd their hive?—On! on! Who saw the Dragon down? Did I not trample it Under the Reafen! Gorm. It was Gorm that quell'd him! The dragon-king himself, fire-breathing Ethelstan! At once I pierced to his tent's heart and his. Anlaf. Saw you him die? Gorm. Watch'd him till on this blade To the last drop he pour'd his red life out! So flush a stream at onset was good omen. Anlaf. Forward then!—lose no fruit of first success: Fall on, ye Danish battle-axes!—cleave them down! All. Forward! [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Camp behind Ethelstan's Tent attacked. Saxons and Danes at close combat, Egil with his harp cheering on the Saxons. Egil. Noble Sons of the Island! Her dauntless defenders! With the lustre of glory, Ever shining in story! Stout-hearted as oaks, Firm-footed as rocks, With breast up to blow, Blunt the sword of the foe! His loved-ones and lands Each good Saxon to save, Let the place where he stands Be the place for his grave! Death to the Danish Dogs! Death to the Loathèd Ones! (Felling a Dane.) Take there seven feet of ground for freehold, thou! Souls of fire, flames of battle! Defeat to all foemen! Ye War-smiths well-banded, With hammers two-handed Their armour make ring Like anvils, kling! kling! Let your lances fly redly As dragons, and deadly! Let the wolf of the wood Fill his jaws purple-streaming, Prepare ye his food For the eagle shrill-screaming! Death to the Danish Dogs! Death to the Loathèd-Ones! (Striking down another.) Thy doom slept in my scabbard!—Sleep thou here! Blight their Host, scathe, and scatter, Ye thunderbolt forgers! With strokes high upheaving Their shielded wall cleaving, Let their bosses of brass Break as brittle as glass! Hew Death a way wide Through wood and tough hide! Through their squadrons afar Make the broad road of slaughter, Through the dense tide of war Wind your blades as through water! Death to the Danish Dogs! Death to the Loathèd Ones! Well done! well done! Saxons. Death to the Loathèd Ones! [Exeunt, driving off the Danes. Another part of the field. Enter Alger and a Captain. Alger. Speed fast unto the ford, where Maiden Ellisif Expects thy message: say the tyrant's slain Within his tent to-night, and by my aid, For which I hope her smiles on me will shine: Say that with him all doubt of fortune dies, For such an idol was he with his followers Their grief must needs unman them, while their foes Our friends, who were their equals ere this chance, Joy will make giants now. Her grace may therefore Strike forward to King Anlaf's camp at once, Where Victory and Alger, hand in hand, Will ere an hour salute her, queen. Away! [Exeunt severally. Scene changes to Brunanburh Hill. Runilda on a height overlooking the field of battle. Constantine, Fergus, and Forces, below. Fergus. O shame to Albin! Shall the Scots stand here Like icicles, congeal'd and pale with terror, When such brave deeds are doing? Constantine. Ours will come Anon, believe it, boy—We must stand here As stubborn as the hill we have to guard, For 'tis our post appointed. Fergus. Would that some landslip Moved it and us to the front! Constantine (to Runilda). What see'st thou, maiden? Runilda. I see two dusky forests on a plain. Each storm-bent at the other; back and fro They swing by turns, with rustlings harsh of boughs, Iron-grown boughs, loose swung or interlock'd! Lo, where they grapple, limbs lopp'd off, and torn From the poor bleeding trunks, bestrew the ground, Brave plumy heads,—rent fibres,—stems split ope From top to root!—There falls a stately tree! Hear what a crash he drops with! what a groan!— Now rises a rough murmur, like the sea's New rushing o'er some rugged-pebbled strand, One murmur from both foes, drear harmony! Dismallest concord!—feel ye it shake the hill, Loud and more loudly rumbling, till the thunder Were but faint echo to it!—Now!—hold breath— With that vast roar ye heard, like firm-set ice Up-broken by the throes of ocean, bursts To rough-edged fragments huge, the squadron'd mass, Floating enormous, heaving bulk 'gainst bulk, With shock on shock, riven, shattered, or sunk!— O 'tis a rueful sight! a ruthless sound! Fergus. Let me away! Constantine (withholding him). Hot-brain! thy duty's here; Who would do more than his duty oft does less! Shall we leave bare our flank?—(to Runilda) Daughter, what now? Tell us each change and fortune of the battle. Runilda. There flies the Reafen, like a fiend of air Gloomily, gathering with restless wing Her ravenous brood beneath her!—there she hovers, A blackness 'tween her foemen and the sun, Dire spot on it to them! Fergus. Doth she fly forward? Runilda. Against her,—forkèd tongue to hornèd beak,— A Dragon breathes his scorching ire; he soars Fix'd, as if held by magic not a man, So proud and high—therefore she moves not forward! Close by his staff an iron cliff of men Frowns silent, and throws off the clamorous billows That foam upon its steadfastness in vain; Therefore she moves not forward! Constantine. Those dumb Sassenach, How can they fight so firm without their king? Fergus. That scorn of raging in them ruins us! Runilda. Hark! their one wild Hurrah!—now mute again! Fergus. They are advancing! [About to rush forth. Runilda. Scarce! Constantine. Stay, parricide! Wilt thou be accessary to my fate, Leaving me here defenceless and infirm, Who could not fling even one light dart of Death, And am like him a shrunk-up skeleton That rattle in mine armour?—Stay, my son! Fergus. O duty! curb of noblest impulses, His heart who loves to keep thy law, cold virtue! Is bloodless.—(To Runilda.) Well, thou piercing voice and eye, Rock-eaglet! what canst shriek about the slaughter? Runilda. This way—this way—begins it now to bend Its gory horn! Fergus. Ha! doth the Reafen yield? Runilda. No! she points forward still i' the centre! still Flying her painted flight against the foe, Eager to clutch him! Fergus. Then doth the Dragon flee? Runilda. Set like an ominous comet in the sky, He glitters dun, his mournful lustre shedding On the too crimson field a deadlier glare!— 'Tis the left wing to me, of both the hosts, Moves scatter'dly together hitherward: Now I could name each hero!—There he singles him, Making his desolation round him— Fergus and Constantine. Anlaf? Runilda. Tower-heavy Turketul!—O murderous work! Each club-swing lays a curve of lifeless men Around his steps—sons, fathers, husbands, lovers— On whom did hang hundreds of lives!—O cruel! Thou slay'st us all,—men, women, babes, together! Fergus. Can none withstand him? Runilda. Who is he that stalks The field like Death himself, where victim ranks Lie after him in swarths? He mows his way Toward that other Destruction, emulous of him? I sicken at the sight!—Heart, heart, thy sex Is changeless—O, I am all woman still! Fergus. Have they met yet?—Who is that champion grim? Runilda. His form doth seem of flame—'tis blood!—all blood!— I cannot see him through such veil—it blinds me!— Nearer they come! Fergus. Canst see him now? the hero Striding at Turketul o'er so much slain? Who is he, the tall ghastliness? Runilda. 'Tis Gorm! His eyes like wandering fires, and spectral pale, As icy balls could burn; his whirlwind hair Toss'd round his head, as when the tempest-cloud Doth helm with darkness some bleak pinnacle: 'Tis Gorm! death-spreading Gorm!—They come—Prepare! [Rushes down. (Clashing her harp.) Glaymore to grasp! and shield over shoulder! In peril aye bolder, Sons of Albin, strain forward like steeds on the start!— Unto battle ye ever-blithe wenders, Erin's bow-benders, Strain up each string and each heart! Constantine. Stand to it, Scotsmen! Fergus. Forth to it, prince of Scots! [Rushes out. Runilda (bursting from her detainers). Live—die—dare hell with him! [Exit. Constantine. Follow, and save them! [Exeunt omnes. Scene changes to the Field of Battle. Trumpets, Combat, &amp;c. Enter Turketul. Turketul. I have but air to beat!—Would they'd come on, Yea even in swarms like bees about a bear, I'd paw them to some tune—Ho! here's a bumble-one!— You, gallows-cheater? Enter Bruern. Bruern. I am for thee, Ogre! Demolisher of our host! Turketul. Where are thy backers? Turketul ne'er lifts club for one alone! [Passing out. Bruern. One that may prove too many for thee—Stand! Turketul. Highwayman's hail!—Pr'ythee, let harmless people Jog on their road in quiet!—Rest you well! [Strikes him dead, and exit. Enter Fergus and Runilda. Fergus. Stout Bruern, slain! Runilda. Thou slay'st not churls but chieftans. Fergus. My sword is hack'd to teeth—give me his brand! Runilda. Breathe here: our friends approach not— Fergus. Foes are welcomer. Enter Edmund and Haco, their swords crimsoned. Edmund (dropping his point as he passes.) Ha! my old play-fellows!— Haco. Farewell! [Exeunt Edmund and Haco. Fergus. Brave Etheling! Runilda. Farewell, dear Haco!—fare thee well!—farewell! Scene changes to another part of the Field. Saxon Forces marching over; Egil at their head. Egil (chanting). Saxon War-men! Battle's pride! Torrent fierce of conquest's tide! Onward like the ocean wide Bursting mound and mole asunder! Bulwark's fall, and foeman's bane, Murmuring for your old domain, Sweep them from the battle-plain, Whelm them your broad surges under! Saxon War-men, on with me! Valour's sons by Victory! 'Tween ourselves contention be Which bold hero leads the slaughter! On! the wild hawk soaring high, Screams for food with famish'd eye! Spread it thick as limbs can lie! Ne'er such banquet battle brought her! Saxons. Onward!—we are well breathed—on, noble Egil! Egil (chanting). Let the axe heat its steel on the helm! And the ruddy blade burn in the wound! If the Dane will remain in the realm, Cleave him straight to the hips and the ground! Saxons. Infidels!—heathen robbers!—loathèd-ones!— Egil. The locusts of the Baltic!—See! a cloud of them. [Exeunt rapidly. Enter Anlaf and Edmund, fighting. Anlaf. Follow thy hell-bound brother, thou more damnable!— Two-fold apostate, thou shalt not escape me!— So renegade! (disarming Edmund) thou shalt never turn again, Except to earth! [As he is about to strike, enter Ethelstan. Ethelstan. Hold, and defend thyself!— Art safe, boy? [Anlaf flies. Edmund. Generous brother! I, that deemed Thou sought'st my life, owe it thee! Ethelstan. Doubt no more! [Exeunt. Another part of the Field. Enter Froda and Gorm, meeting. Gorm. Well happ'd on, brother-ranger of the brine! How fares it with us? Froda. Thou'rt so blind with dust And blood and sweat, thou canst not see how goes The general field! Gorm. By mighty Thor, blind-drunken With the hot fumes of gore!—How flies the Reafen? Froda. Methinks as I can see her through the darts, Her beak droops somewhat. Gorm. 'Tis to pluck the dead! She stoops to pluck the swine-gorged Saxons bare! Never had else look'd down! Froda. Brave Edwal's slain. Gorm. True: as I pass'd him now, a javelin Stood upright in his heart.—Havoc! let's on! Froda. My bands are this way. [Exit. Gorm. This way, Gorm alone! Enter Turketul. Monstrous!—the north-sea Kraken come on land! I thought till now that grisly animal Had upwards of two feet!—By Thor, I'm proud, Whate'er he is, to catch the prodigy At last!—Where must I pierce his leathern scales? Turketul. Take thy good leisure—view me round and round! Gorm. Thor, what an ancle!—Thor, what limbs!—O Thor, What depth of brawn to bury a sword in! Turketul. Humph!— There's no such superabundance about thee, Thou skeleton of a Norway skiff on end! Thou bugbear from the Valley of Dry Bones! O how my club will clatter among thy ribs! I will make broken ice of thee! Gorm. This sword That strews a field with carnage of itself, My sway makes Ruin's scythe!—Look how it glitters, My blood-wash'd battle-axe, that erst was brown! Are these to be despised?—Know ye my name? Gorm, the Shield-Render!—Has it never clove Through thy dull ear? Turketul. Ay, but I've doff'd my shield, Ergo, thou'rt no shield-render unto me! Gorm. Of nine accomplishments I am full master; In the Norse warrior's circle of the arts, Am perfect: At bow, battle-axe, and brand, None can approach my skill; being ambidexter, I with two javelins take two lives at once; I play at chess well, besides other games, As tossing up three darts, two kept in air, One in the hand; I swim shark-swift; I skate Over earth's broadest bridge, the Arctic ice, Fast as the north wind; I could ride the Nightmare Even in her wildest rage, and shoe her after Like your most cunning War-smith: I can row Sleeker than swallow skims, and round my boat Run outside on the slippery oars at play: What think'st of Gorm the Sea-king, now? Turketul. Nought worse! Come let us have a spice of thy perfections, Knight of the Nine Accomplishments! Gorm. O joy! I combat, dauntless hero, one of the Gods, Even mighty Thor, the thunderer's self, in thee! Turketul. Thou art more like the Spirit of Evil, Lok, After thy pagan creed!—Impious, I'll teach thee Some reverence to thy gods, false though they be! [They fight. Enter Egil with Saxons, Froda with Danes, who pause in conflict to admire the single combat. Danes. The Dane! the Sea-king! lightning-sworded Gorm! Saxons. The chancellor, and his iron mace!—the Saxon!— Froda. Who would have thought the Wild Bull could so wheel him, Supple-back'd as the serpent? Egil. Or the serpent Raise him upon his footless coils as firm, To dart a blow, as the wild bull can stand? Danes and Saxons. Gorm! Gorm!—Turketul! Turketul!—Now!— Egil and Froda. Well fought! fair trial!—Southron against Norman!— Egil. There is the blow from both that must end one!— [Gorm stricken down. Turketul. Fell, laugh'd, and died!—he made a goodly end! Froda. The yellow-footed bird will long bewail Him who purveyed her many a feast,—brave Gorm! [General combat; the Danes driven off. Part of the Field, with a coppice. Fergus wounded; Runilda supporting his head on her lap. Fergus. Dying, dear Maiden!—dying!—weep not!—dying!— Ay, leaving thee for ever!—weep not, Herva!— Nay, now I look at thee, I prithee weep; That tearlessness, that wide unwinking gaze, Is kin to frenzy!—Weep girl! I am dying!— O righteous judgment on my faithlessness To that good king!—death makes my sin more clear!— O my poor gray-hair'd father!—wilt thou, Herva, Be in my stead a child to the old man? Thy lips say yes, but have no voice!—Alas, That comfort spoke by dying friends is none, But disconsoles the more!—I cannot soothe her!— Maiden, the sound of struggling feet draws near: Help! I'll to shelter in the brake, and die Bird-like, unseen: lift thou my heavy locks That they touch not the tainted dust.— (He retires). Now, lay them Carefully on my bosom, as becomes A prince and warrior!—Let them mix with thine Dishevell'd o'er me thus, that face to face As in a little loving cave together, Thou shalt alone receive my last, fond sigh! Enter a crowd of combatants: amongst them Ethelstan and Anlaf engaged hand to hand. Anlaf. Tyrant, lay corse and crown here at my feet! Ethelstan. My life and kingdom both upon the blow! [He strikes, and his faulchion breaks. Anlaf is rapt away in the crowd. Ethelstan. Bare-handed, at the mercy of the Dane! My sword a traitor?—half sawn through the hilts, To fail me when most needed!—But one moment, I had a victory in this grasp, and now Not even poor vengeance for defeat and death!— See what base rabble mouths yell hither at me! Anlaf, why com'st not thou with kingly ire To give me a king's fate!—nay, while there grows A weapon here, one life shall cost them twain: [Approaching the Copse, Runilda meets him with the sword of Fergus. A sword!—Heaven-dropp'd!—Salvation!—God, I thank thee!— Enter several Welsh-kin: Ethelstan defends himself, with Runilda at his side, and before him the body of Fergus, who has dragged it expiring to the King's feet. Soldiers driven out. Ethelstan. What Guardian Spirit art thou, that gav'st this sword, And fought'st so fiercely calm, so mute beside me? For very superstition at thy air, They cower'd and fled!—Why buriest thy face? [She motions to the body of Fergus. My hostage! and my Glee-maid!—guests, and ingrates!— No! my life's saviours!—Ah, young, dead defender! Thou hadst my heart's forgiveness ere thou died'st.— [Runilda falls at his knees and embraces them. Poor Youth!—poor Maiden!—ill-starr'd, luckless pair! O what a fathomless spring of sorrow is love, When not of joy!—Ay, cast thee on his corse! I scarce can wish thee e'er rise from it more!— This is no time for tears or ye should have them: The scales are trembling with still heavier fates; My sword must be thrown in, to weigh one down! [Exit. View of the Danish Camp. Trumpets. Flight and pursuit. Enter Anlaf and Froda. Anlaf. Whirl'd from him, when his life was in my hands, When,—his sword being lost,—on mine grew white My knuckles with strong grasp,—when to the stroke Tiptoe I rose,—then was I whirl'd away By our own reeling runagates!—O rage, Thou'lt do the office of a sword upon me, Riving both head and heart!—See where they run! Stop them, good Froda!—if no other way, Smite them to earth! there let the vile ones die, Fit death for dastards, smother'd in the mire? Froda. I'll smite!—I cannot bawl them back;—My lungs Are torn to thongs!—I'm suffocate myself, Throat-full of blood, and foam, and swelling ire! [Exit. Anlaf (exit, crying aloud). Rally around the Reafen! Anlaf! rally! King Anlaf! rally! Rally around the Reafen! The Danish Camp at Brunanburh. Assault and defence. Enter Anlaf and Ethelstan with the Reafen and Dragon standards on opposite sides. Anlaf. Again, usurper!—Thanks to the Hall of Gods, I have thee under my sword's edge again! Robber of kingdoms! plunderer of palaces! Thou thief of my regalia! who hast stepp'd Into the jewell'd shoes which thou didst steal, And stand'st so high in now! Ethelstan. Husband thy breath; Scold it not all out; thou wilt need it soon, Whether to fight, or flee. Anlaf. Hast thou not stolen, Huge-handed larcener! Northumbria from me? Stol'n it? Ethelstan. Say wrench'd,—for a first step to truth: My word makes dint like thine, with less of din. Anlaf. Doth not the violent wrench and rob at once? Ethelstan. He robs not who but wrenches his own rights, Where there's no law regarded, that awards them. True, I have wrench'd Northumbria from thy grasp, And hold it in mine own; rob it again Thence, if thou canst, as while my hand lay on it Loose in Security's sleep, thou didst before. Anlaf. It was my father Sihtric's, and so mine! Ethelstan. He was my vassal,—but a vice-king o'er it. I gave him it, and more, for wife my Sister, Edgitha, now the fairest saint in Heaven, Whom he, from that old hate of devils to angels, Divorced injuriously; divorced his soul Too, from the Mother of Saints, our Christian Church, Whom at same time with like oaths he had spoused: Thus, an apostate, and adulterer, Return'd to Danish idols, false-wed wives, Heaven's hand was swifter than mine own to venge me, Ere I could reach him he had died! Anlaf. Thy tongue, Red sword of the mouth, is feebler still, I swear, Than that in thy faint hand. Ethelstan. It drips, withal! Anlaf. Did Anlaf spouse thy Sister or thy Church? Did he divorce them? What did Anlaf,—Anlaf? Ethelstan. Forswore no faith as vassal-king, I grant, But vassal-subject!—Anlaf ne'er was king, Except of Irish kerns and Danish pirates!— Anlaf, ambition-swell'd, bore him too big At home: and so was sent to find at large Without this small isle, scope for his great merits! Anlaf. Fool, he did find it! Ethelstan. Wolf-like, in the wilderness! Sea-wolf and land-wolf, both!—whether he prowl'd The watery waste for spoil, or denn'd himself In bleak Ibernia's glacial isle, and taught Its habitants his fierce howl!—still wolfish ever! Anlaf. Who made him so but thou?—Turn forth a dog, The fondest, faithfullest, most docile creature, Into the foodless wild, and he returns A hell-hound! his once silky coat like thine Shaggy as this I wear! his bark of welcome, A growl, that shakes his very ribs with ire, Like thunder running through them, when he sees thee; Now furious for thy life, which he before Had lost his own defending! Ethelstan. Docile thou wert not, Nor any of thy blood! When ye rebell'd, And fate of rebels made thy brother, Godfrid, My prisoner, I fain had call'd him guest; But still his fierceness would encave itself Glaring in some dark corner of my Court, Nor could rich fare, mild looks, nor soothing words, Tame down the tiger in him; no, not once, Soften to thankfulness or kind regard, His anger-lighted and cold-blazing eye! Ere four short days he fled, and perish'd savagely. Thou art his brother both in spirit and blood! Anlaf. For these foul taunts and scorns, thou spurious king, The space of a long night awaits thee!—Ay! Even though thy falchion with miraculous power,— A Saxon boast,—cleft Dunbar rock in twain! 'Twill be my greater glory to cleave thee, Stone-hard of heart, and let the reptile out That centres rancorous there! Ethelstan. We've stood too long, Like opposite cliffs that only frown defiance, Re-echoing empty threats, and noise for noise! Anlaf. Mountains shall meet in us! Ethelstan. England and Denmark! [They fight. Battle joined. Another part of the Camp. Enter Turketul and Saxon rear-guard rushing past him. Turketul. Lead up the Londoners and the men of Mercia! This way, stout hearts!—Your king has thrown himself Standard-like midst the foe, ye must recover him! The Danes are rallied, and return full roar Like ocean from his ebb!—On! on!—Proud Anlaf With devilish fury, giant arrogance, Swells both in spirit and form beyond a man,— Threats Victory herself!—Would that the king Had let me undertake him! If I fell 'Twere nobody! if the King fell, it were all! [Exeunt omnes. SCENE III. Interior of a Danish Tent. Upon a buckler, supported by trestles, is laid the body of Fergus. Constantine, his hands locked, and Runilda, sitting each side of it. Enter Ellisif hastily. Ellisif. The camp assaulted! Up for shame, old king! Myself have drawn a dagger that shall give A woman's blow,—incurable,—to the heart! Up! even a man can do as much when age Makes him as faint of arm, if as fierce-will'd! Thou couldst destroy one Saxon; one, it might be, Who is the life of millions!—O what a deed, Glorious and utilous, which a child might do, Seventy or seven years old, of weakest nerve, With its nurse-tender's needle nicely driven! Up, royal host! defend thy guest—thyself— Save both—perchance the field. Constantine. I care not for it— The pillars of earth and heaven may fall together On miserable me!—I care not for it! Would the last day were come! Ellisif. The last day come? 'Tis come long since! and daily going on To thousands,—all, with whom this world is ended!— Destruction now strides hither,—hark his step!— He and Confusion with her numberless feet, His helpmate dear!—Faith, I'll lend her my hand For sake of common sex; and who knows all Disorder may turn up to a steady eye?— Ha! Ethelstan!—by my presaging hopes And hates, this way he stumbles!—said I not, 'Twas never in mischance too late to die? Victory's crown may from the head be pluck'd Even as it drops there, and upon its place Vengeance pour out her vial!—Firm, be firm! Enter Anlaf, driven in by Ethelstan: others combating; the tent overthrown. Ethelstan. Yield self or life! Ellisif (striking at Ethelstan with her dagger). Yield them both, thou to me! [Runilda rushing between, receives the blow through her breast. Baffled!—hadst thou a hundred arms and eyes, Thou hadst not 'scaped, but for this fond—fool—Woman! Ethelstan. Take up the girl, and lay her by her lover: Devotedness, how beautiful thou look'st, Yea in the blood of thy self-sacrifice!— (To Turketul entering) Hath Anlaf 'scaped? Turketul. Fled fast! Ethelstan. Pursue him, Chancellor! But make the road smooth for his swift retreat. [Exit Turketul. Ellisif. Take off thy silent eye from me: thou see'st Enough already what I am,—save this— Thy brother's widow!—Edwin's! Ethelstan. Waked at last! Ellisif. Now to the block!—You have a host of headsmen! Ethelstan. Convey her to her cell at Beverley.— (To Ellisif.) Seek there Heaven's pardon; though such deeds might well Drain Mercy's fountain dry!—Hope, like myself, Nought in this life, but leave to quit it soon! [Exit Ellisif guarded. (Looking after her.) I stand like one deserted on an isle, That keeps the parting vessel long in view, Till a mere sun-bright speck,—which vanishes And tells him—hope is gone! (Beholding Constantine.) My self, grown old! Cypress, thou art the real crown of kings!— Thy punishment is heavy, sovran neighbour, Losing both child and realm by one sad chance; I give thee back this last, as some poor solace In such a sorrow: How more glorious far To make a king than be a king! Enter Edmund, Egil, Goderic, and Saxons, with the Reafen Standard. All fled? Edmund. All, but five kings, seven yarls, and churls by thousands, Left on the field. Egil. O ay! ay! others, flocks of them!— Their kindred,—eagles, ravens, hawks, kites, cormorants,— Sure to bide with them till their bones are bleach'd! (Chanting.) Strike the harp in Triumph strain! Fall'n the Reafen, fled the Dane! The Dragon soars On Victory's wing! And farthest shores, And latest time, Shall tell of Saxons and their king In ode sublime! Long as the mountain, stream, and moor, So long thy glory, shall endure, O battle-field of Brunanburh! Ethelstan. Thanks noble Egil, for thy sword and song!— Thanks every one!—But are the Cambrians fled? The Picts? the Gael? Egil. Like flying crows, all wings! Ethelstan. Well, slay them not, but scourge them sharply home: I am full king of England now, and lose The conqueror in the father, over all! Edmund, thou art mine heir; no other son Shall wifeless Ethelstan e'er have but thee: I feel swift dissolution in my blood; Let me devote my poor remain of years To glean the harvest of this glorious field, Honour, and peace, and union to the Isle: Be this my sole aim, and some solacement!
