      <field name="fulltext">PROMETHEUS THE FIRE-BRINGER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION TO Dr. Leonhard Schmitz, Ph.D., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOTE. As it is impossible to know into whose hands a book, of any class, may chance to fall, and as it is very certain that many persons of the highest intelligence, taste, and feeling, have had no opportunities for the study of classical antiquities, I hope to be excused for offering a word or two on the nobly suggestive old fable of âPrometheus.â The Supreme Ruler of the Early Gods, at a very remote period of the Greek mythology, was Ouranos. His son âIapetusâ (Japetus) was one of the Titans, and the father of the Titan demi-god, Prometheus. Hence, the descendants of Ouranos were called the âOuranidai.â Of this early dynasty was also Oceanus, and his daughters the Sea-Nymphs, or Oceanides. âIapetus,â with others of the Ouranidai, warred against Heaven, and dethroned the Ruling Power who succeeded Ouranos; but they were themselves vanquished by Zeus (in later centuries adopted into the Roman mythology as Jupiter, or Jove), with the assistance of Athena (the Minerva of the Romans), and Hephaistos, or Vulcan. Aphrodite was transferred into the Roman mythology under the name of Venus, and Helios, under that of PhÅbus, or the Sun-God. The common-place vulgar statement that Prometheus âstole fireâ from Heaven, does no justice to the real spirit of this magnificent mythological fable. The expression would be better suited to the brutal prostitution of the popular taste for burlesquing, with prodigal costliness, the noblest and the most beautiful subjects. The Supreme Ruler, Zeus, did not take away the unspeakable blessing of fire from mortals. This severe punishment had been inflicted by the Ruling Power of an earlier period. But Zeus refused to restore the precious gift; and Prometheus undertook to obtain it for mankind. This great act of self-devotion brought down upon himself the most tremendous and long-lasting vengeance of Zeus. According to my view, Prometheus should therefore be regarded as the friend and instructor of Humanity,âits first Champion, and its first Martyr;âthe grand old Pagan archetype, and providential foreshadowing of the Divine Master who came upon the earth many centuries afterwards. R. H. H.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene is at the foot of Mount Ãtna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The time, from day-break till mid-noon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Athena. Beneath this island's lowest granite rocks And heated porphyry, I hear thy voice Break the divine star-silence of the night, O, Hundred-handed Giant whom I slew, By my war-chariot clad with blazing swords, Rushing amidst thy limbs, and buried here, To groan beside black Typhon. Thou would'st taunt me With change of mind, and treachery to Zeus, Since I befriend Prometheus, who designs To save the human race, as thou hast heard. But Destiny, throughout all Nature, frames Wise laws of change by infinite degrees, And modes, and times; and I from Father Zeus Am only moved as star removes from star,â Retaining our relations. By his brainâ Which, brain-like, is but half in self-controlâ Teeming with fresh creations, and the power To call them forth in substances and forms, And for his further viewsâperchance some fears, Beyond thy thoughtâhe contemplates to sweep Mankind from off the earth, replacing them By a different race. Fruitless annihilation! Prometheus, the far-seeing, knows that men, In any shape on earth, will still be men, And hence would them preserve, and from their state Of present want and misery redeem. Wherefore, O, smouldering Giant, lie thou still Beneath this island's ever-trembling crags, And think not any aid I may accord Prometheus, 'gainst the Ruler of the Gods, Will reach to thee. I am the same I was; Like Nature, with due course of difference. But now the stars retire! and Mother Night, With a profound sigh, heard by Gods alone, And understood by only some of them, Shade after shade withdraws; while down the slope Of dusky Ãtna, a more dusky form Descends. It is Hephaistos from his forge! Hephaistos. Wise, war-surpassing Goddess, thou hast heard, As I have heard, the struggles and the voice Of the deep-buried one, Enkelados, Who, by some chance, has been apprised of deeds Prometheus contemplates, and thinks once more To come on earth, for battles as of old, Against Olympos' King. But what, indeed, Would Atlas' brother, forewarn'd, rashly do? Athena. He hath not spoken it, but by my knowledge Of superhuman, as of human thoughts, I do perceive he hath resolved to save Mankind from Zeus' destroying hand. Hephaistos. What means Hath he to do this? Athena. Bring them back the glory Of earthly things, man once possessed, by Fire! Hephaistos. The flower and glory also of the Gods! This were rebellion, and it must not be. Son of the Titans, he would once again Call up a race to crush our several thrones! But see, the wretched Islanders approach! Athena. They creep like shades before the coming day; But the fair day will come, and man look up. And others also come from foreign shores,â With Sea-Nymphs, following slowly, as in thought. The Four Divisions of the Chorus march on, in slow time, and form. Chorus. Grey, silent twilight of the dawn! How often have we watched in vain, On lone sea sands, or fields of weedy corn, Or barren stony plain, The coming of a season less forlorn, When life, like day, would rise again. Sub-Chorus the First. [Islanders.] But mornings creep and climb Above our miserable heads; Their course is marked no more than shell-fish slime,â We sink in ignorance to our earthy beds. We strive to till the soil, And weeds, or blight, or rotting grain, Reward our toil. Sub-Chorus the Second. [Shipwrecked Mariners.] We strive to sail across the main: We drive on rocks where billows boil! Sub-Chorus the Third. [Troglodytes.] Our dwelling is in holes and caves: We seem to live within our graves. Sub-Chorus the First. While he who tries to build, soon finds Some mad, mane-tossing Winds, From Boreas' echoing stalls, Bear far away his roofâlay flat his walls! Sub-Chorus the Fourth. [Oceanides.] If omens come, man cannot read them; If saviour gods, man does not heed them; Because his eyes can only see His body's wants and misery. The few who have a clearer sight Are folded in the common night; For all, with purblind dreams o'ergrown, Mistake clear vision for their own. Thou, great Athena, know'st our kinsman's plan; Protect, and aid, the heroic Friend of Man! Choragus. O, Goddess, if thy presence here Betoken good to human kind, Address some words to us! O, come more near, That we may take into each sense Thine own ambrosial influence, In body, and in mind; And learn if any happy chance May better this our fallen state, Though dark Hephaistos frowns askance, Reminding us of Zeus and Fate! Chorus. Grey, purpling twilight of the dawn! Thou changest softly in thy hues; Sad-coloured orange melting streaky blues, Show that another infant Day is born. Athena. Be hopeful. Nothing on the mythic earth, However lowâa rudiment of lifeâ That once uplifts its head into the light, Retains its meanness, but begins to climb; Receiving that, in modified due course, Which soon will be caught down, at once from Heaven. Sub-Chorus the First. Thy words, O Goddess, pass beyond The measure of our thought; But with some purport they are fraught, Which teaches man should ne'er despond. Chorus. Retiring twilight of the dawn! A coming radiance through thee glows; The rapture of thy spell is gone, Transforming slowly, like an opening rose! Athena. Receive the omen!âsomething is at hand Of highest good for Man, if he will use The gift aright. Daughters of old Oceanus! Lo! where the burning breath and nostril-smoke Of Helios' chariot steeds, from the eastern line Begin to rise! Soon will he clothe with light The flat earth and its circumambient sea. But ere the God of Day pass o'er your heads, A daring act, worthy a Titan's son, Will be attempted. Hephaistos. And as surely punished. Chorus. What act, O, Goddess! and what son, Or great descendant of that ancient race, Which in Olympos' highest place, Once sat on thrones near the All-Ruling One? Hephaistos. Beware of those unmeasured words! The reign Of that old dynasty has long since ended; And now the thunder from my sacred forge, Vibrates in other hands. Chorus. Yet, Goddess, say or show What actâwhat Titanâ? Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. Great Prometheus! No other can it be, we know From our hoar sire Oceanus, Who sent us from his emerald caves below. Athena. Yes, it is he; and he would now restore The greatest boon that mortals e'er possessedâ Their greatest lossâthe Gods' first gloryâFire! Chorus. What sudden gleams, What blinding beams, Break o'er our minds, and dazzle every thought! As though we once had known A blessing that had flown,â A wonder vanished, leaving us distraught! Choragus. Vague memories rise, and flit acrossâ As of a grandsire's dying words, Which of his grandsire he records,â So that we seem to know our unknown loss. Chorus. But wherefore did some Ancient God's behest That glorious gift withdraw, Leaving a man no better than a beast; And why doth Zeus withhold afar? Athena. Prometheus comes!âbelieve in him. Farewell! Chorus. 'Midst folding mists of silver-grey, The stately Goddess, on her car, Rich in device of peace and war, Brazen-winged griffins bear away! Hephaistos. Welcome! true son of great Iapetusâ Noblest of Titans, though his body lie In Tartarus for ever. Prometheus. Still, a God. Hail, friend! albeit I know thy hand can forge Chains for a tyrant's vengeance, as of yore. Hephaistos. But most unwillingly, at times, thou knowest. Chorus. This is the God! The Titan's son! Who beareth the rod Of the shining One! To waive in the air, Make want disappear, And our life-course, clear As the rivers, run! Prometheus. Such rod of power I have not in my hand, But I will strive to gain it, and restore To suffering Man. Hephaistos. Man is not worth the risk Which you incur. Ungrateful is the race, By nature, more especially to those Who serve them most, and sacrifice themselves. Prometheus. That question forms no part of my design. Full oft when man hath cause for gratitude, Some gall-drops lie beneath, that he should need Such service. Yearnings for a vague perfection, Fret the fine roots of his imperfect nature. These poor beginnings of the human race, Are centuries distant from such noble themes! Therefore say nothing more of gratitude. Chorus. Thou hast not, in thy present hold, This glory, wondrous to behold, Of powers and uses manifold, Which once we had, as we are told: But wherefore have we lost? What actâwhat thought, in young or old, This dreadful penalty hath cost? Hephaistos. The Ruler of the Elder Gods withdrew The spirit of power from mortals, for their crimes. Sub-chorus of Oceanides. Answer Choragus!âstrike, from varied strings, The sacred harmony of music's wings, Which goat-horn'd lyre, Cithara, harp and phormynx, now inspire! Choragus. That race is long extinct; its debt, However deep, is deeply paid, And Chronos, in his star-light net, Hath borne them to eternal shade. Those mortals are to us no more Than wrecks beneath a fabled sea; Shells ground to sand, on some strange shore, Beyond the dreams of memory. Then wherefore should the Reigning Power Invest our lives with serpent-rings,â Call from the dust a weed, or flower, To bear the curse of unknown things? Hephaistos. Shall the worm turn, and, midst its tiny coils, Measure Eternity, and Zeus' decrees? Prometheus. Honour the dynasty of the Early Gods! Peace and fertility to the grass of mortals, Who did and suffered in that grand old time. Hephaistos. And suffered justly. Prometheus. Doubtfully, to reason. Chorus. Seeing, they did not make themselves, But like the insects, trees, and flowers in season, Came upâlooked roundâ Received the high Sun's passing smileâ Droopedâand sank back into the ground, Like those who dwell upon this isle. Hephaistos. The early race of men offended Heaven, And were swept down. It may be so again; And ye may find yourselves in Tartarus, Like those before ye! Prometheus. Soâhe stumbles off! The great Artificer of the Gods, retires,â Ascending zig-zag tow'rds his lofty forge. Mark now the actual business of the hour! The marble quarry, and the granite rock, Are solid masses of unshapely stone, Till mind and hand the ponderous block inspire; Prepare ye therefore to receive a gift, The greatest mortals ever can receiveâ (Except those gifts they cannot comprehend), One which shall give them skill and mastery Over all metals, and all earthly forms;â For now I am prepared to scale the Heavens, And bring down Fire, which Man shall keep for ever. Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. [With lyre and phormynx.] Oh Titan God! Descendant of the ancient Dignities! The grand old Dynasty, whereof the Syrens Sing to their star-entrancing lyres, And Echo bears among the shining spheres, For soft responses through Infinity! Son of the father of the human raceâ Iapetus! Revered in surging tears by hoary Ocean, Beloved by all his Daughters, and all spirits That comprehend, or simply feel thy purpose,â Thy pure, self-sacrifice, without our thought That sacrifice of self is anything; Receive our prayers, our blessings, and our hearts,â Not meanly, slavishly, but all in love, Honour and Glory, Faith, Hope, full reliance,â And now we wait to see thy perilous daring. Sub-Chorus, First and Second. But, oh, Prometheus! saviour of our race, Low-fallenâever punishedâpause awhile: We are not all of selfânot utterly baseâ Though God-abandoned, crawling on this isle; We canâwe do, feel for thee, as ourselves. And one who fishes, digs, and delves, Hunts, tends his herds, for ever thus employedâ In lowest needs, at once says all In rough words, like rough things let fall; And we implore thee not to be destroyed By efforts for our good!âO, we are worth No sacrifice of noble earth, Far less of one so high. This from our inmost life, we pray,âwe cry! Prometheus. That cry, from the deep well of human life, Which would restrain, drives onward my resolve, Sparkling my springs of being with the sense Of a true common nature in the world. Chorus. Yet pause awhile! 'Tis sunrise!âits alarming smile Gilds every face, like demons in dismay! Thou hopeful, yet too dreadful God of Day, What dost thou bring? We tremble for ourselves!âfor everything! Prometheus. It is not yet the hour to light my torch: I wait for the full blaze of Helios' car. Chorus. Then wilt thou meet in their ascent, The frantic, snow-white Horses of the Sun! And, through the blinding element Of flame-light, plunge to thy intent;â Bethink thee, ere the deed be done! Prometheus. I have thought deeply; and shall think no more, Lest it disturb the action clearly planned. Chorus. We tremble stillâour fear is wise, Having no knowledge of the skiesâ Nor much of aught beneath that lies. Prometheus. My sons, think what the earth hath lost thro' fear! Sub-Chorus the First. What have we lost? Sub-Chorus the Second. Good lives, sometimesâ When fear suspended active powerâ By hand of man, or tooth of beast, The falling tree, the snake beneath the flower; By floods, or snows in Scythian climes, By lightning, or the crater-shower; By sunken rocks in unknown seas; By sudden darknessâstrange disease. Sub-Chorus the Third. By hunger also, when stored food Was in the land; By want of clothing, till our blood Ran cold about our bones, Like winter-rills through stones, While skins of goats were near at hand, And sheep and oxen open to demand! We feared to seize, though Nature's laws Showed us just cause; And feared to work, lest hire should be A bait for daily slavery. Prometheus. The earth is broad enough for each man's bread, And work, no less than food, is necessary. Only a slavish mind can be enslaved; E'en though Olympos' Ruler crushed his form: For tyrants thrive best on man's dreamy fears, Thus liberty is lost. Fear groundless fears. Chorus. But, we have lost so many things Through fear, we tremble yet the more, Lest hell-born powers with flaming wings Should bear us to their native shore. Prometheus. Into the future gazing, I perceive Imagination works more influence Than all man's other faculties combined; Siding with indolence, and slackening nerve; Arming and pluming Incapacity, In those whose strong desire to have and hold, Mistakes itself for efforts well applied, And worthiness to win. But oh, my sons, What fear has lost in this rude twilight age, Is nothing to the losses yet to come! One thing I promise ye, it shall not cause The loss of this commanding element Ye need, for uses without number. Chorus. Fire! Shall we receive that wonder from thy hand? Sub-Chorus the First. We pray for things we do not understand! Prometheus. I have promised it. By means of this bright gift, Most useful arts, unnumbered, as unknown To present mortals, will be re-attained, And gradually make perfect. Brass and iron, Will take the place of flint; pulse, berries, roots, Exchanged for well-stored grain. Rude huts and caves Will be transformed to homes of artful brick, Made with baked mud and straw, or hewn from rocks; And graves of mariners to sheltering coves, Where ships ride safe at anchor. Bear in mind, Your ancestors were taught by me to frame And use the plough; also to tame and manage Poseidon's gift, left wild as his own wavesâ Until Athena placed within my hands A bridle; and for oxen shaped the yoke, Whereby with foreheads garlanded, and hymns To the beneficent Ã¦gis-bearing Queen, They turned the black soil upward to the sun, Amidst her olive-groves. Elms, hung with vines In long festoons, hoary with tasselled fruit, And corn-fields flowing to the horizon's verge, O'er level plain and softly swelling downs, Were all as common blessings on the earth,â Athena with her counsels aiding me. Such things, and many others, swept away With a past race, shall re-appear. Chorus. With Fire! Its spirit dawns like a new soul, That sees a new course open, a new goal! Prometheus. Quarrying and mining, will again become The means of many triumphs. By the first, Substance is gained for the Arch-builder's art, Of widest usefulness and perennial grandeur; From humblest roof, to loftiest dome or spire, Rough-hewn, or rich in statues of the Gods, Where man can pour libationsâoffer up His prayers with incense-fumes and dirging hymns, While the blood bubbles o'er the gilded floor, Ere the dark rites and mysteries begin;â Man's mad devices not approved by me: And by the second, wealth incalculable, Will shine o'er earth, which, wrongly used, will prove A curse, but used aright, a means of good; Such good as, in a future age, the mines Of silver-glittering Laurion will confer, Whereby ten score black-bench'd triremes, by Greeks Shall be constructed, and at once destroy The invading bird-flocks of a Persian fleet, Coming to rend the mind and chain the man, Screaming down Art and Science at their birthâ Choking life's noblest waters at their source. Sub-Chorus the First. And without fire such things had never been, As thou hast seen; Nor could they be, As thy prophetic vision now doth see. Chorus. And can we touch this wonder in thy hand? What is it? Doth it live and feed? If so, 'were terrible indeed; If dead, how can it serve our need? Sub-Chorus the First. We pray for things we do not understand. Prometheus. 'Tis common in all temples; but the good Gods Reserve for their own wisdom what to grant. Chorus. We see it in the sun's great ball! We see it in the lightning! The moon and starsâthe meteor's rushing fallâ The glow-worm's fitful brightening! The crater's brief up-blazing tree! The smitten night-wave's brilliancy! The fly and beetle's many coloured lamp, O'er dark old graves and dismal swamp, Whose dews and fogs are deathâinhaled, imbibed! But how collect, coerce, combineâ The fitful flame-leaves intertwine,â Of that out-shooting, luminous vine, Thou hast erewhile described? How shall we hold The flashing and aÃ«rial gold? How shall we act, so that it be Ours, and obtain not mastery O'er us, and all that we possess,â A gift too great, that adds to our distress! Prometheus. Possession mostly gives the power to use! The man who first bestrode the fierce wild horseâ Curbed his frothed mouthâdefied his bloodshot eyeâ Caressed his high-arched neck, and taught his legs To change their rampant bounds for regular pace,â Slowâsurging gracefullyâor fleet as wind That skims the desert with unruffled wing;â E'en such a man will learn to handle fire. His tribe will follow. Chorus. Thou hast done this thing, And wilt, again, with cheering smile; Teaching thy art so perilous Unto the worthiest on our isle, Should'st thou attain it, O, Prometheus! But how can we, Who comprehend no more than we can see, And nought of that, at times, Conceive this arduous contest won, When each who up a mountain climbs, Dares not too boldly face the sun, While thou design'st to seize the solar fire? Sub-Chorus the First and Third. If thy attempt should prove thy funeral pyre, How shall we bear The inclement wintry air, And our savage food and fare, After so many hopes and dreams Of earthly blessings from these subject beams? Prometheus. As I will bear my fate, so bear thou thine. Chorus. But tell us more! Oh, let us know How thou wilt 'scape the cloudy roar Of bolts from Zeus,âfor swift or slow, They will thy form in ashes strow, And, with them, scatter all our hopes! Show us thy aims, and endsâ Thy meansâthy Titan friendsâ Thy wall of shieldsâand towering ladder-slopes! Prometheus. Too great an action fills my mind for words. I cannot further speak. Sub-Chorus the First. He turns asideâ Like one who knows the time and tide! Straight onward moves, gathering a hollow reedâ A pine-bough, for a torch, beside! Sub-Chorus the First, Second, and Third. Will he indeed Defy the power of Zeus, who hath denied To man the use of this bright element? Can he succeed? Father of Gods, O give consent, Even against thy first harsh will, And let him fill, From thy great fountain-glare, and bring To earth the struggling luminous thing, To warm our bloodâ Encrease our food,â Nor injuring fruit, or grain, or grass,â To melt and model any massâ Make tools of iron, copper, brassâ Darts, spears, and shields. Sub-Chorus First. See where Prometheus strides beyond the fields! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. We weave our choral-dance, and pray, But also fear the Gods have fixt a bound,â Jealous of man's ascent beyond his clay, Heavenward, and questioning Stars and Thrones around. But, O Great Zeus! if it may be, Relent, and spare Humanity! And leave its little scope quite free! Chorus. See, where Prometheus strides the lowlands now! Across the creeks and floods,â Over the uplands steadfastly and slow! And now into the darkling woods! Mysterious caves are there, Serpents, and dragons grim and spare, Stone-shapes and Shadows, whispering âWould'st thou dare?â But see! above the sombre line Of distant forestâcedar, pineâ Rises a headâhumanâdivineâ And shoulder like the Appenine, Looming afar! But to our straining thoughts, a rising star Where'on our eyes and hopes are fixed, And gushing tears with aspirations mixed. Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. Oh, listen!âfaintly breathingâ Waftingâswellingâswooningâstealingâ Ãolian music 'tends the mystic wreathing Of sapphire-glowing vapours, now revealing Prometheus' fast-ascending feet! Chorus. 'Tis followed by a different sound, Like silver trumpets under-ground! It searches our hair-rootsâso thrilling sweet! O, may that more than martial symphony Inspire the Titan's soul with victory! Sub-Chorus the First. What favoring Goddess' hand, To sounds that make us tremble, yet exult, Preluding a foreknown result, Works the invisible command, Whereat yon shrouding mist of dazzling blue, Melts the horizon in its violet hue, So that the Hero's perilous ascent From earth into the firmament, He makes, unknown to the Olympian host? Choragus. [With cithara and phormynx.] Oh, can such hopes as these be lost? Can such exalted dreams be vain, Falling like Hesperidean rain Of liquid gold and emerald pale, Calling forth flowers For Goddess' bowers, To end like thistle-down upon the gale? Cheering the heart of future-seeking man, By nourishing his fancy's span With fruit too high, which no one can attain? Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. We heard Athena's trumpets sound Beneath the ecstatic and uplifting ground! And now our streaming locks receive A fragrance, such as fumes of incense give, When from rough jasper cups libations pour, Propitiating Gods on high; For lo! another Deity Approaches!âAphrodite! loveliest flower Of Ocean, Earth, and of Olympos' sky! Chorus. Hail Goddess! too divinely fair For mortal vision, and earth's heavy air! Spell-bound we standâscarcely to breathe we dare! Aphrodite. The luminous gold of Helios' floating reins Erewhile I saw amidst the breaks of cloud, And soon Prometheus will a brother meet, Whose course is fixed by an eternal law, And may not favour any other scheme. The Sun hath his own system; and the rays For Earth allotted cannot be encreased, Or lessened, save by some Titanic act, Which may bring down destruction. Still, believe Wisdom and Love make all things possible. Chorus. Amidst the orient clouds we see The beautiful gleam Of the golden-floating reins, And the radiating beam On the upper plains, Reflecting the Sun-God's pageantry! Aphrodite. O, not in vain your Hero scales the Heavens, For time may be divided infinitely, And actions in the period of a thoughtâ A single flashâa rayâone spark intenseâ May dart forth, changing thus the destiny Of Earth, and all that on her surface moves. Hephaistos, not at heart an envious God, But friendly to the Titan, is firm-clench'd In his allegiance to his Father, Zeus, And cannot act, or think, in adverse ways. It is an honoured God, whom I am bound To know as one that claims me for his own; But I, perceiving human elements Have some divinity perversely mixed In their creation, never can forego Belief and hope of man's refining change, From Egypt's dusky-leaved aureola, To a new series worthy Heaven's best care: Psyche, from coarsest substances evolvedâ Passing through passion's trialsâearthly wrongsâ Self-contradictions purified in fireâ And human love, in its full human sense, Made perfect, to the honour of the hand That moulded and inspirited his clay. This, sons of earth, and Daughters nobly born Of the divine, foam-crown'd Oceanus, I, Aphrodite, Goddess of the fount, The germ, root, spirit, essence of sentient lifeâ The only life of limitless advance, Or, bounded only by the spheric lawsâ To you declare, and breathe into your hearts The hope and confidence of that success Man may not merit, but shall yet receive, Because we knowâAthena and myselfâ That poor humanity, in every clime, Hath never had fair dealing from his Gods. Echo. âToo lenient to his crimes! âHis crimes! his crimes! â'Tis man's own fault! âHis fault!âhis crimes!â Chorus. Some direful Voice, faint Echo hither wafts! Whose Voice?âThe earth shakes underneath our feet! From the volcano's smoking gloom it came! Sub-Chorus the Second. 1. Let us haste to the sea shore! 2. Hoist sail!âply the oar! 3. And wait not for wind or for tide! 4. Our faults, and our crimes, In many distant climes, Pursue us o'er the waters wide! 5. Beshrew craft and crewâ Both by sea and land, undo! 6. And pursue us o'er the waters wide! Aphrodite. Hephaistos spakeâbut not to you his words. Who are these strangers? Choragus. Shipwrecked mariners! Sub-Chorus the Second. O, CytherÃ¦an Goddess, and Protectress! Aphrodite. Whence come ye, friends? Sub-Chorus the Second. 1. From many a shore We never had beheld before, 2. And ne'er shall visit any more. 3. All ignorant, but adventurous men. 4. Fragments of many a wreck are we. 5. PhÅnician and Pelasgian. 6. What should we know of sailing thro' the sea? Aphrodite. What shores?âwhat seas?âyour briny wanderings tell. Sub-Chorus the Second. We braved the broad Ionian surge, From hundred-citied Creta's coast, Where great King Phasmos launched a fleet, Which did rare deeds, and then was lost. Aphrodite. Where gain'd your bark safe shelter from the storms? Sub-Chorus the Second. O, Goddess! upon Afric's coast, Like shells and shingles we were cast, And tow'rds Betzura shaped our way, As naked as a new-made mast. But in that stately tower-wall'd mound, Most hospitable cheer we found. Aphrodite. Where next, ye heedless children of the wave? Sub-Chorus the Second. Thence, soon again, with songs and flags, We bore a cargo o'er the deep, To Scythian lands, and on the crags Of Salmydessia's foaming jaws Had nearly sunk to lasting sleep. What should we know of sailing through the sea? Or travelling inland?âignorant men are we. We left our bark;âaway we sped, Hearing of gold minesâvein and seamâ Common as lead! Foot-torn we wandered, till we saw The Arimaspian mountains gleam In the white distance! 'Twas a dream! The gold was in a crazy head. Aphrodite. And thence, how came ye here? Sub-Chorus the Second. We found, at length, our best-loved elementâ The old, inconstant, dashing seaâ And on some new adventure bent, Into its billowy breast dashed we. On prosperous gales we bore away With a good freight of furs and oil, Till anchor'd in Aulonia's bay We were paid well for our slight toil. Thence, caught by squalls, we sighted tracks Along the Locrian sea-board lying, But fled adrift in sail-rent plight, Like leeward birds who scream while flying. For days and nights we curs'd and prayed Alternately and constantly; Exhaustedâyet to sleep afraidâ What should we know of sailing through the sea? A new moon came: We cried to the Gods but Our course held the same! Aphrodite. The Sun moves upward!âquickly to the end! Sub-Chorus the Second. We knew not whither we scudding sped, Till broken waters we spied ahead, And then too clearly we saw our courseâ The end of this cruizeâwith the chance of a worse! A shifty wind, and a leeward draught, Made our helmsman look like a child on a raft; Our rudder unshipp'dâthe rigging scatter'dâ Our mad bark struckâand her bows were shatter'd, While the rent sail flank'd in the flagging breeze, On the reefs of the Argyraspides. Aphrodite. But wherefore came ye here?âor by what chance? If ye know clearly, speak it not too plain. Sub-Chorus the Second. O, Goddess, 'tis within our brains Confused, as eye-sight when it rains. Another craft received us straightâ Such as survived that last ill-fateâ And, one and all, we vowed to be More pious towards the Gods, and thee! One night our captain had a dream: A shrill voice from the eastward came, Which cried âOrtygia!ââand next morn, We found we all had dreamed the same. And every night for thrice three nights, Right in the path of the morning star, 'Midst the black clouds we saw great sights! Torch-Races!âwith fast flashing lights, And shrilling criesââOrtygia!â Before our eyes new demi-gods had birth, Which, from the saffron robes of Eos' breast came forth! And then the Sun glode down, and kissed the Earth! Aphrodite. No more. The momentâand the actâdraw near! Sub-Chorus the Second. Oh, from that night great joy had we, While flying through the singing seaâ Its foaming, hissing, laughing white and blue, Following in leaping rows behind! Some Goddess sent a faithful windâ The first we ever knew! Echo. âSome Goddess sentâ We ever knew!â Aphrodite. Peace! thou unnatural child of Earth and Air! Chorus. The patient shepherd folds his flock; The weary mariner stows his spars; Then, purposeless, on deck or rock, Watch for the rise, or setting of the stars. But we are taught that nobler things By active knowledge may be won; Two Goddesses expand broad wings, Tipt with the fire-gold of the Sun, And point to deeds that shall be done! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. Gone!âAphrodite melts and fades, Like summer lights in sacred glades! And in the air Aroundâafarâ Float odours rare Of flowery islesâincenseâambrosia! Chorus. And we are left, expecting still Triumphant signsâ Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. Or signs of ill! Choragus. Prepare the embattled Choral Dance, In honour of the morning's birth, Whereon for prosperous advance, A sudden change comes o'er the earth! While phormynx, and cithara strings Mingle with varied voices sweet, Evolve, from east to west, your martial wings,â Then back return with measured feet. Resume the Dance, from west to east, The second strophe's chorus-songâ The second anti-strophe next, Back to the centre brings your throng. Full in the centre then whirl roundâ Your phalanx-danceâthe epode's verseâ And add the wild flute's double sound, Man's future ages to rehearse. Choral-Dance. S. 1st. In our night-time,â Deep darkness! Our day-path, As marklessâ Our life's hearth As sparkless, Man was like his own shade A.S. 1st. For he knew not His measure,â His hard lot, Or treasure,â His plague-spot, Or pleasure,â Were by himself made. S. 2nd. But from twilight, This morning, God and Goddess Gave warning,â Hope's fresh beams Adorning Our land and our sea A.S. 2nd. For the Titan Is earning A victory Burning; Our destinies Turning, To make the slave free! E. Then whirl round, With tramp and bound! 'Tis Prometheus' chosen ground Our Dance-Chorus tread! Let shrill pipe, and magic string With varied voices mingle, Cymbals clash, and sweetly tingle, Or sharply ring and ding, Until ye wake the dead! 1. Rouse and shift, And then lift Your dank and dusky head! Forth! come forth, O, ye dead! 2. Lo! a prize, From the skies! So, from mound and mouldering bed, And cold, wreck-rich sand, Come forth, O, ye dead! And 'midst our Phalanx stand! 3. But if ye can awake And your old place take, We shall know ye were never really dead; Though common dust ye seemed, Ye will be what prophets dreamed, By Prometheus' torch redeemed From your Lethean bed! Chorus. For the Titan now will bring, All struggling from the skies, The ecstatic, flashing thing, To arm with light the hand and head, And glorify the eyes! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. Reserve your comosâyour exulting joysâ Until a fitting hour; For now, perchance, the God of Light destroys The self-devoting Hero's power! Sub-Chorus the First. Whatever stars arise, Seem adverse to perverted eyes! Sub-Chorus the Second. Whatever shore they find Is a reef, with a foul wind! Sub-Chorus the Third. And our caves, when warm and high, Are the beds where serpents lie! Choragus. Like a child that lies on its mother's breast, Mankind will sleep, and smile at rest, While the earthquake heaves beneath; Though a few years since, ah! too well known, The monster swallow'd a populous townâ Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. To save it from Ãtna's breath! Sub-Chorus the Third. Our home is in the red rockâ Green rockâ Grey rockâ Grassy bank, or the mountain side, With lava-stones abounding, Land and sea-beasts' bones surrounding, We wall out the wind and the tide. Our food has been the dog's foodâ Hawk's foodâ Hog's foodâ But dainties we soon shall crunch and quaff; With the Titan's gift this morning, New years of strength adorning, At Nature's old convulsions we shall laugh. Chorus. See! see! see! Dread Shapes and Portents of calamity! A rushâa rushing through the clouds! Which heave and burst and fly, And now are driven Athwart the Olympian Heaven, In broken shades and adverse forms, Unlike all natural storms, As though invisible demi-gods, in crowds, Fled in their wild dismays Before the javelin rays Of Helios' car,â Assaulted on his never-changing ways! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. See! see! see! A meteor dashes suddenly, Aslant from out the air, Towards earth!âbut lo! it vanishes in air! And horrid Shadows now, Stream in a threatening row, As if to bar and scare Descent, and passage throughâ Chorus. Despair! despair! Prometheus fails!âbehold his arm Battling and breaking through the storm! Four blasts converging, like cross seas, And needing, to repel all these, The limbs of the Hekatoncheires! Yet see! he issues, swathed in conflicting glooms! And downward comes, Leaping and bounding, From black cloud-ledges, broken stair by stair, 'Midst the Four Winds, resounding, And wrestling still Against his courseâ Hissing, and yelling shrill; Now hollow and hoarse,â Striving to tear, And straining out to frightful points his hair! Echo. In the heavens afar, 'Midst dark flying clouds, I hear the war, The scream and the jar, The hiss and the roar,â The swinging and whirling, Wild winging and swirling, The rentsâthe combining, The knotsâthe entwining, That, strangling, close binds, And deafens and blinds,â 'Tis the wrestling of the Winds! Chorus. Once more! once more in sight! He plunges down the surging height! Again assaulting Shades surround, And hide the Titan from our view; Yet downwards tow'rds this rocky ground He surely comes, by fall or bound; And now he re-appears in swarthy hue, 'Midst the Winds, howling bleak, And on the mountain's topmost peak His feet alight! Down, down he comes in battling flight, And fainting, as from some death blowâ Smitten by bolts of Zeus, or Ãtna's rocky ballsâ Prone at the mountain's foot our Champion falls! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. [With cithara and phormynx.] Behold his reddened limbs outlaid! Scorch'd, like the clay whereof he made The first Man, and Man's mind with golden beams arrayed! But now he lies, a giant heap, In death-trance, or in dying sleep, And o'er his stone-carv'd face, his massive locks fall deep! Chorus. Hath he obtained the wondrous prize? For, lying here, with granite-lidded eyes, We fear it 'bodes us evil destinies! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. His lips moveâbut no sound we hear! Approach him softly!ânearâmore near. Chorus. Again his lips essay to speakâ And one large tear rolls down his umber'd cheek! Listen! Oh, listen to his words, Faint as Ãolia's dying chords! Prometheus. Rejoice! Chorus. He lives!âthe Titan cannot die, But on the earth may passive lie,â Alas! throughout eternity! Prometheus. Rejoice! Chorus. He speaks! he hath escaped the blasting rays Of the Sun's chariot, and the scathing blaze From wrathful Zeus!âbut into sudden night His daring torch was dashed. Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. But lo! how bright Yon hollow reed doth trembling hold The prize, of wonders manifold, Preserved!âthe spark intensely white, Fresh from the sacred fount of Life and Light! Chorus. Oh, Earth ring forth your gladness! Rejoice ye seas and skies! No more of want, of ignorance, and sadnessâ Prometheus from the ground doth rise! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. Hark! hark!âOh, listen to the sound Of silver trumpets under ground! Athena bids all things that be, Thrill to that march of Victory! Prometheus. Now may ye fabricate all implements For agriculture, home-use, and for building Houses and ships and temples to the Gods; Learning all arts to make earth habitable, Man's life to cherish, and prolong in years, Rendering his pathway flowery and complete, So that he may look upward evermore, Blessing the Gods for all things. But, indeed, Having this gift I bring, do not, misjudging, Sink into indolence and unfounded hopes, From this bright, dangerous servant, but exert All faculties for its appropriate use. Chorus. To theeâand all thisâwe devote ourselves. Prometheus. Sea-coasts and inland countries ye shall learn, And how to find each spot with least delayâ To trace, re-trace, and never to be lost; As steers the bird his voyage through the airâ Clear as the local memories of a horse, Direct as points the compass in his brain; Gifts of their natures, but which man, by art, Will, in due time, acquire. In every climeâ On land, or sea, a new friend shall he find: Nipped by white death in frozen tracks, or lost In maddening woods, man lights a fire, and smiles! These things I well foreseeâsome near at handâ Some, after yearsâsome, in remoter ages, And some, which ye may have, but never holdâ Instincts and revelations snatched awayâ Material good made perfect, and o'erthrown, And man roll'd back into a barbarous time, Thence to begin again. It may be so. Chorus. O, cease Prometheusâfar too wiseâ These melancholy prophecies! Prometheus. Meantime, ye children of the present hour, Enjoy it, and employ it for the best, And, in my absence, think that I am near, E'en though ye never should behold me more, Since Fate will not permit that I should tarry Among ye long. My path of operation, E'en half its scope, comes to the precipice. Echo. âTo the precipice!â Sub-Chorus the First. Hark! Echo calls! Sub-Chorus the Second. Lost on the distant waves! Sub-Chorus the Third. Among the island's founts and falls, Or sea-weed caves! Chorus. O Zeus! what words doth Echo now repeat From the remote dark air, Flushing with fitful glare, While black clouds open round the Thron'd One's feet! Echo. âAccomplished!â Chorus. Hark! from Mount Ida's sky! Echo. âDescended with the prize!â Chorus. Where shall we fly! Yes, 'tis the voice of Zeus which Echo brings On her invisible wings! Appallingâfreezingâclear, not loudâ From yonder scudding rack of ghastly cloud! Echo. âPrometheus!â Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. Lo! the words of Zeus! Echo. âPrometheus!â Prometheus. Speak!âhe knows his destiny Chorus. Where shall we fly? Where darkly lie?â Oh, spare!â What depth of deepest shade Can blot us from thine Eye! Oh, spare! Oh, spare, dread Zeus! the creatures thou hast made! Echo. âPrometheus! son of fallen Iapetus! âThe son of Ouranos!âthe son of GÃ¦a!âson âOf Chaos!â âThou hast robbed the eternal Fountain, âEssence, and spirit âOf Lifeâthe life of all Heaven's reigning Godsâ âAll Gods that yet may reignâ âAnd life of all the things that creep on earth, âOr yet may creep, swim, walk, or fly, or feelâ âAnd brought it down, in madness, to redeem âFallen man!â Prometheus. This service have I done the race. Echo. âRash Titan!â âForeknowledge is not knowledge of the Present, âIn all its forms and necessary grades âThrough centuries. I reign. Take thy reward!â Prometheus. Foreknowledge sculptures fortitude, in minds Worthy to hold foreknowledge. Chorus. Reigning Zeus! Thou Present God!âspare us!âwe are innocent! It was the Titan-god, Prometheus, Who braved thy bolts omnipotent! We had no wrong intentâ No thoughtâno hopeâ No wish to enlarge our scope,â But with our abject lot we were content, Born, as we were, in that low element! And if aught more we e'er desired, It was because we were inspired By the fall'n Titan's son, Who of himself hath doneâ By his own planâ His views of God and manâ This dreadful deed, wherewith our hearts were fired! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. Dark clouds close in the skies,â And far-off Echo speaks no more; but we, With shame cast down our eyes, At your ungrateful falsity! Sub-Chorus the First. We spake the truth. Sub-Chorus the Second. Though 'twas not brave Ourselves to save, Thrusting our Champion underneath the wave! Sub-Chorus the Third. Who comes? Oh, be still! 'Tis the great Iron-hand! His furrow'd brow glooms, Zeus' wrath to fulfil, And scatter our lives in the sand! O, spare! we are innocent!âall has been done By the Titan, Prometheusâstanding alone! Hephaistos. As all will stand alone among mankind After such dangerous service. I am comeâ Not without pain, Prometheusâbeing sentâ And pain from several causes. I am lameâ But that is not the worst of all I feelâ Only I do not deem it wise to speak What I fain would;âunnecessary words To one who knows. But, for these Islandersâ This human raceâall those who stand around, Trembling and shuffling, both in feet and mindâ Yes, all of these, except great Ocean's Daughters, Who are most constant in their love to thee,â Did I not tell thee, Titan, to thy front And tower-skull pitch of knowledge, that thy work And its results, were prodigally spent Upon a selfish and ungrateful herd? Prometheus. To know all, is to forgive. Hephaistos. But I, indeed, Have not so full a knowledge, and I do not, In any one respect forgive this herd. Sub-Chorus the Third. What should we know of these great dreams? At all new things we gape, surprised! If good for usâor worst, or best, O, forge-black God, we know no test! When from above a sudden wonder gleams, We start up, all dismayed and paralysed, While our breast heaves, Like to some lonely bird, when through the leaves, A human face looks in upon her nest! Chorus. We thought the hour was come for us to die! At certain times man is not half himself! It was not we who spakeâit was our fear! Prometheus. Like death-bed babblings, when a man hath lost His nerves and steady sense, and his poor brain Spins off the melting pictures of the pastâ Into wild darkness. All men fear to die: 'Tis wrong, yet reasonable. Comfort ye, my sons, With recollection of your strongest hours, And loftiest thoughts. Chorus. Believe, Prometheus, what we said Broke from usâas from men half dead! Sub-Chorus the First. 'Tis mid-day nowâyet Heaven grows dark! The Sun rolls on behind, in gloom; Some Fury, like a winged shark, Seems coming with a dreadful doom! Chorus. It passes onwardâbut for whom? Choragus. What are those Figures standing in the shadow Of overhanging rocks?âthemselves like rocksâ Or, are they also, shadows? Hephaistos. Strength and Force! They come to bear away Prometheus! Chorus. Oh, God of Day! Take back the glorious prize, Won by the Titan from thy mourning skies! And let us, wretched, on this barren shore, Remain as hopeless as before, So he be pardoned. Lead him not away. Hephaistos. Your right minds come too late for gratitude,â A curse that will beset ye to the end. Now screams the eagle for your champion's heart! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. The fangs may rend, the hailstorm freeze; He will endure for future fruit, And, silent as the growth of trees, Believe in Sun-light, and a root! Hephaistos. Prometheus! I must bear thee far away, To centuries of tortureâas thou know'stâ Bound on the top of Caucasus, whose white horror Scowls o'er the loftiest Hyperborean peaks. Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. All graceful are the flowers On the plains beneath the sea, And the gleaming Ghosts and Shadows, That, dilating, comeâand flee! But the caves of black coral, And depths of emerald gloom, We will seekâand not speakâ But think Curses on this doom! Hephaistos. Those who can do nought else, may curse their fill. The reign of the Ouranidai is no more: They are but Clouds enthroned in a crazy brain. Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. We wander through the waves And the glimmering caves Of Tethys; O'er the sands, and salt strands, And the weedy rocks of Metis; To the groves and alcoves, Where the Oread's seat is, And the Syrens chaunt our sacred theme! But each morn, isles of spawn In the east lie burning, It ever brings to mind, With its glories returning, Our fathers' lost thronesâ Till, with mad passion yearning, We plunge to our deep, deep Dream! Hephaistos. It is impossible to hear plants grow, Or the Hours move; nor can I hear ye raveâ But I can see ye raving. Plunge deep downâ This Dynasty is lasting. Strength, and Force! Wake from your pedestals among those rocks, And lead the way to Scythia's frozen wilds! Prometheus. Daughters of Ocean!âfriends at worst of seasons, True hearts, unchanging when all others failâ Farewell! And you, my sons, of mortal mould,â True also in the centre of your heartsâ Where all, indeed, are true, in their degreeâ Treasure my giftâremember well my words, And teach yourselves by labour; offering prayers To the just Gods; and, more especially, Athena and Hephaistos; Aphrodite (Profound her worship as the source of life) At fitting seasons; and Apollo always, As God of many gracious arts and aims,â Who, with Hephaistos and my brother, Helios, Present the triune master-spiritâFire! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. Earth! Heaven! and Poesy! We are all handmaids to the three, And of the Champion of Humanity! Hephaistos. Again the eagle screams! It must be done. Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. O, Helios!âAthena, Adored by the Titan! O, Phoibos-Apollo! And thou, dread Hephaistos, Not willingly coming From white Aphrodite! We shriek, O remember Heaven's earliest Throned-Onesâ The great Ouranidai! Behold! led to torture, Through ages uncounted, Their noblest Descendant! Hephaistos. Titan, while honoring thee, I well remember Thy race, and hold in reasonable dread Thy possible acts. Iapetus lies prone; Typhon, a monstrous effigy of coalâ Titans and Giants roll in Tartarus, With chain and bolt of thrice-clamped manacles, 'Neath rocks which Chaos might himself approve; But thou, indeed, with a spear-brandishing hand, And sun-distorting shield of polished brassâ Besides thy subtle counsels, arts, and skillâ May'st lead new wars for an Olympian Throne! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. He answers not, in his disdain; He had no thought to war, or reign; Mankind alone engaged that earth-enfolding brain Hephaistos. Wherefore, Prometheus, son of Iapetusâ The son of Ouranosâson of GÃ¦aâson Of Chaosâlineage highest, but the foe Of Zeus!âthy torturing doom through centuries, Is fixed. Chorus. Ai! ai! ai! Prometheus. I have done my work. Hephaistos. On, now, to Caucasus! Sub-Chorus of Oceanides. We shall be there. Among the white crags seated high In that petrific air; Low chanting many a prophesy Of hope enrich'd by memory. Thy brow shall wear a pyracanthine wreath, Above the icy glare of Fate, and idiot Death! Chorus. Ai! ai! ai! Echo. âValiant! valiant!â Chorus. Behold, the chariot of the Sun breaks forth, Above our heads! And on the all-reviving Earth Its full meridian' fulgence sheds! Through yonder glaring break The Voice of Helios spake! See! see! the tightened reign! List to the far-off Voice, again! Echo. âValiant Prometheus! âTitan! âBrother! âHeavenâEarthâand Oceanâ âNightâstarry Mother! âGreet thee, this day!â Chorus. Onward away! away his steeds, Mad with the momentary pause, Plunge through the scattered clouds!â Helios! The East, at heart, exults and bleeds In crimson founts and purpling flaws, Seen through the flying vapoury shrouds!â Helios! The wind flares back his blazing hair! Away he whirls!âa new-born sphere! 'Midst rolling swathes of stormy goldâ Fold over-running fold, Divided rock, and torn-up dell, Temple, and fallen citadel, Of architectural Airâ In one far-radiating glare The exalted form, and chariot, disappear! All but the uprais'd guiding hand, And dizzy, whitening wheel, half-seen, below! Choragus. He's gone!âagain on earth we stand! But not with our old wants and woe: For though the gorgeous billows close behind That life-creating carâwhile our redeemer, Prometheus, Is borne to torture in captivity, On hell-surpassing Caucasus,â Yet hath he left the seeds of a great mind, To germinate through ages slow, And flourish in futurity,â Realized visions of the martyr'd dreamer! For all things now, To us poor mortals, rich in hope, Whom also faith and love inspire, Are placed within our work's expanding scope, By the pure gift of Fire!</field>
