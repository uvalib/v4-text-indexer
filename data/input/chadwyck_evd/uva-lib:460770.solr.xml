      <field name="fulltext">CAT-ALOGUE OF SCENERY. 1.—THE MILL. How the Miller died, and left his Three Nephews behind him; and how he left his property. “Reading of the Will”—not after Wil-kie! 2.—THE PALACE. How the Maids of Honour conducted themselves in the absence of the Princess, and how they were summoned to the Palace Court. 3.—THE ROYAL COURTYARD. How Puss in Boots brought a Present of Game to the King from his Master the Marquis of Carabas. How the Marquis began to make a splash in the world; and how he preferred the King's suit to his own, and his own to the Princess's! 4.—THE KING'S HIGHWAY. A very moving Scene! being a Panorama! (painted by Mr. W. Marshall) which the Manager of the Theatre trusts will at Last Work Pretty Well. How Puss in Boots appears to get on, and how he serves his Master, singing at the same time, “THE VENETIAN FUR-LANA,” with a Running Accompaniment. 5.—THE OGRE'S CASTLE. How Puss gets in, and meets the Cook getting out! 6.—THE OGRE'S HALL. How the Ogre hires Puss as Cook, and how the Cat cat-ers for him. How the Marquis becomes Lord of the Castle, and generously lets the Cat out of the Bag; and how a Terrible Cat-astrophe is prevented by the ARRIVAL OF THE FAIRY FELINA, Mounted on a Cat-a-Mountain! How the Piece terminates; and how everybody hopes to “Live happy ever afterwards!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —The Mill, and landscape—Shed with a donkey in it. Enter separately Millers with sacks, and Neighbours; they place sacks by the Mill-door. [Millers and Neighbours] Round—“When the wind blows”—“Miller and his Men” Bishop. Ill the wind blows (Ev'ry one knows) That brings no good to any; Round as it chops, Some luck it drops, To one, at least, out of the many. Enter from Mill, Ralph, then Richard and Robin, rubbing their eyes and gaping. Ral. Richard and Robin, you're two pretty men To lie a-bed thus till the clock strikes ten! Our friends have come to hear the will we've found, Made by our uncle Grist—now under ground. Rob. Ay, death at last has sacked the miller's dust. (All Neighbours listen) Rich. We'll die some day or other, all men must; So where's the use of grieving? Here's his will: And as we said but now—It is an ill Wind that blows no one good—so let us see What this may bring to comfort you or me Who can read written hand? Rob. Not I. Neigh. Nor I. Ral. I'm not quite sure that I can, but I'll try. (opens the Will) Ha! 'Tis in verse. To his old tune I see: “The Jolly Miller on the River Dee!” Sings the Will. “I was a jolly miller once, But a grave one soon shall be; So all my worldly goods I leave Amongst my nephews three. To Richard I bequeath the mill— Rich. (The mill!) To Robin the old donkey; Rob. (Oh!) And the cat I leave to Ralph, as Re- Siduary legatee!” Rich. Left me the mill! a good soul, by the mass! Rob. Left me the donkey—an old stupid ass! Ral. Nay, brother, you may something make of that; But what am I to do, pray, with the cat? Rich. Kill him, and make a fur cap of his skin. Neighbours and friends, I beg you'll all walk in— Into my house. Sorrow, you know, is dry; I'll broach a cask—I wish my ale to try. Nunkey, I know, used famous stuff to brew: Brothers, I stand upon no forms with you. I shall be glad to see you, now and then, If you don't come too often. Ho! my men! Look to my guests. Music—Exeunt into house Neighbours and Millers. Rob. Why, brother Richard, sure You won't forget we're brothers, though I'm poor. Rich. Forget you, Robin! that can never be; Whene'er I see an ass, I'll think of thee! Ral. But, brother— Rich. Oh, you want your share, Ralph, do you? My cook shall catch the cat, and bring him to you! Chord—The Fairy Felina suddenly appears beside the door as an old beggar woman. Rich. How now, what do you here so near my door? Air—Fairy—“With lowly suit.” Relieve my woes, my wants distressing, And heav'n reward you with its blessing. Fairy. Good master! charity— Rich. Away, before My servants come, and through my mill-pond drag you! Don't charity begin at home, you hag, you? (Exit Richard into the house) Air—Fairy—“Over the mountain.” (To Robin) Pity, kind gentleman, friend of humanity, Cold blows the wind through my garments so torn; Give me some food, I beseech you, for charity, Nought have I tasted since yesterday morn! Rob. Out of my sight, you tattered gipsy thief, Go to the parish if you want relief. Good-bye, Ralph; I shall go and sell this beast, And live well, while the money lasts, at least! (Exit Robin with donkey) Fairy (to Ralph) Good youth, I'm very hungry, weary, ill— Ral. Good mother, I have nothing but good will To offer thee, and thou wouldst starve on that, As I must do—when I have ate my cat. Fairy. Eaten your cat? Ral. 'Tis all I have to eat; You shall dine with me—if you like cat's meat. Fairy. Feel in your pocket; sure, there's something there. Ral. Not a brass farthing, Eh! how's this? I swear Here's a broad piece! Why, to be sure—you're right— The very coin I thought I'd lost last night, And searched for everywhere, as I'm a sinner! Kind fortune! Now, Dame, you shall have a dinner. Fairy. Thanks, generous youth; but think first—can you spare it? It is your last. Ral. No matter, you shall share it. You brought the luck; besides 'twould spoil my carving, To know, while I dined, a poor soul was starving. Fairy. Well said; but where's this cat of which you spoke? Ral. Oh, hang the cat! It was a sorry joke Of uncle thus, by some strange whimsey bitten, To die, and scratch poor Ralph off with—a kitten! Enter Servant with basket from Mill. Serv. Here's Tom, sir. I've had such a job to catch him; You'll go a long way, Master Ralph, to match him. Ral. Is he so handsome? Serv. Handsome! ay, and clever! (sets down basket) I never see'd his equal—no—not never! He's such a mouser! Lord! the tricks he plays Them rats and mice! Hangs up like dead some days— Sometimes amongst the meal, the cunning joker, Will stretch himself as stiff as any poker! And when they venture out, like vermin silly, He'll kill his hundred in less time than Billy! A dog celebrated for destroying rats, as some of my readers may remember. I've often said, if our cat could but speak, He'd outwit Lawyer Ferret in a week! (Exit Servant) Ral. But what's all this to one without a house, Who cannot want a cat to catch a mouse! Fairy. Come, come, my good young friend, be not dejected, Fortune smiles often when she's least expected. Behold! (appears as Fairy) Ral. A fairy! Fairy. Banish all alarm— O'er man I have no power, for good or harm; But cats of every kind obey my laws, From Catamandoo to the Catabaws! The merits of this mouser long I've known; So, to reward the kindness you have shewn, And give fair play to his address and whim, My art shall make almost a man of him; And if the starry book of fate speak true, He shall, ere long, make quite a man of you! Air—Fairy—“The Lass of Patie's Mill.” The cat of yonder mill, So cunning, quick, and gay, Shall all his wit and skill In your behalf display; Until you bless the day, When, by your uncle's will, You only bore away The cat of yonder mill! Ral. I'm quite content, since you espouse my cause! I like the cat and don't regret the clause. Fairy. Apparelled as befits your new pursuits, Rise, Tom, and take the name of Puss in Boots! Mewsic—Puss in Boots comes out of the basket. Puss. My whiskers! what a change comes o'er my dream. Ral. D'ye like it, Pussy! Puss. Does a cat like cream? I'm quite enchanted! Fairy. Yes, of course you're that. Puss. My sovereign here? O ho! I smell a rat! Fairy. Do your boots fit you? Puss. What a pair of swells! I like 'em better, far, than walnut-shells. Fairy. Would you have gloves? Puss. No, not at any price! “A cat in mittens never catches mice.” Fairy. Farewell, then. Please your master, you'll please me. Puss. Your pardon. There's one little point, I see, Something that fashion may be shocked about— Whiskers are in, I know; but—tails are out. Fairy. Hang fashion! You were made—or else we fail— “To point a moral, and adorn a tale.” (Fairy descends through basket) Duo—Ralph and Puss—“Pretty Polly, say.” “Beggar's Opera.” Ral. Pretty Pussy, say, Will you drive away All blue devils which would prey On your loving master? Puss. In this disguise, My sharp eyes For care's scratch, whate'er its size, Shall find some nice court plaister. Fondly ever, purring thus. Ral. Oh! pretty, pretty Puss. Puss. How many I serve you, gentle master, say— What d'ye want? Ral. Ev'rything on earth! Puss. Stay! stay! Name what you most want, first. Ral. I scarce know what— If luck's put up I bid for the whole lot! Puss. Well, then, hear me. I heard the neighbours say, The King was coming here to hunt to-day. Suppose we go to court—when there, why you May please the Princess Rosebud; if you do, Marry her, and your fortune's made. Ral. Hey-day! 'Tis now my turn, I think, to cry “Stay! stay!” We go to court?—I wed a princess fair? You're building pretty castles in the air. Puss. I'll build or find one that shall own you lord; And you may safely build upon my word. As to the court, and all that sort of thing, You know “A cat, sir, may look at a king;” In short, take courage as I bid you do, And as the lawyers say—“I'll pull you through!” Song—Puss—“Galloping dreary Dun.” You are my master, and I am your man, Politic Puss in boots! So listen, I'll tell you a part of my plan, Politic Puss in boots! I'll get me a bag with some parsley and bran, And catch a fat rabbit as soon as I can, With my haily, gaily, gambol daily, Rollicking, frolicking, whiskery, friskery, Politic Puss in boots! I'll scamper all over his Majesty's park, Politic Puss in boots! And frighten away all his game for a lark, Politic Puss in boots! Then take him the rabbit, and say with an air, Accept of this here, sir—instead of that hare, With my haily, gaily, &amp;c. Of course, he'll be anxious to know who I am, Politic Puss in boots! I'll tell him a nobleman's valet de sham, Politic Puss in boots! Of course for this nobleman, sir, you must pass, A great foreign marquis—my Lord Carabas— With my haily, gaily, &amp;c. Then straight for the princess with love you must burn, Politic Puss in boots! Win her and wed, and be king in your turn! Politic Puss in boots! First lord of the treasury then make of me, And how I'll catch rats in that case you shall see, With my haily, gaily, gambol daily, Frolicking, rollicking, friskery, whiskery, Politic Puss in boots! (Exeunt Puss and Ralph)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —Chamber in the Palace. Enter Arietta, Chatterina, and Skipperella. Ar. Well, Chatterina, you may talk about talking as long as you please; but how you can prefer it to singing I cannot imagine. (singing) “Sing! sing! music was given,” &amp;c. Chat. And you may sing about singing as long as you please; but you'll never persuade me it's half as agreeable as talking. Skip. For my part, I like talking very well—but I like singing better—and I like dancing more than either. (pirouetting) Chat. Stop! stop!—one word before you go any further. Let me understand your argument. What is the first position? Skip. This. (placing her feet in the first position) Chat. How absurd! Instead of replying with your tongue, you answer with your toe. Skip. I find it answer so well that I make a point of it. (suiting the action to the word) Chat. I've heard of people talking with their fingers; but this is going to extremities! You'll tell me next that conversation can be carried on better without words than with them. Ar. Words are well enough if they're set to music. (singing) “Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear.” Skip. “Or like a fairy trip upon the green.” (dancing) That's the best line in the song. Chat. Very well, very well: as you like, ladies; I give it up. Go on in your own ways; only answer my questions somehow. I'm perfectly ready to hear you: indeed I'd much rather, because if I were to keep on talking, and not shew myself ready to listen to you, I know very well what you'd say. There's Chatterina, as usual, you'd say, talk, talk, talk, talk,—and nobody can get a word in: so let there be an end of the argument, and please to answer the question I asked more than half an hour ago,—What can be the reason of our young mistress remaining so long single? Ar. (singing) “There's nobody coming to marry her, Nobody coming to woo.” Chat. Not at this moment, perhaps: but she has had many suitors, and always refused them. Skip. She cast off two couple last week. Chat. There'll be another chance for her to-day, for the King is out hunting, and he generally brings some new members of the hunt home with him, Ar. (singing) “If he have luck, He'll bring a buck, Upon his lusty shoulders home.” From glee in Colman's drama “The Iron Chest.” (horns without) Chat. Talking of bucks I hear the horns. He's returning already, Skip. Then we must dance attendance on the Princess. Chat. Here's Baron Bagshot coming from the chase He's neither bagg'd nor shot much, by his face! Enter Baron. All. Baron, good day. Bar. Sweet ladies, how d'ye do? We've seen no game to-day so fair as you! Such beauty is a most refreshing sight. All. Oh, Baron! you are always so polite. Chat. Pray tell us, Baron, what sport have you had? Bar. To tell you the plain truth, ma'am, shocking bad; So bad that (though I grieve to spread the rumour) His Majesty is in an awful humour. Quartette—Rossini. Quickly, ladies, change your faces, 'Twouldn't do at court, to see ye Full of smiling airs and graces, When the King is in the dumps. No more singing, no more dancing, Staidly walk instead of prancing, Move about with solemn faces, Mute as though you'd got the mumps. Chatterina! Skipperella! Tongue and foot alike must fetter, There's an end, poor Arietta! To your re, mi, fa, sol, la! But though so wretched we Must appear to be, Fortune will speedily Treat us less cruelly; Sorrow at court will be Soon out of season, Music and revelry Cease to be treason. Once again merrily We'll sing and bound, Carnival keeping All the year round.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third. —Court-yard of the Palace. Tableau. The King, Princess Rosebud, Baron, Courtiers, Maids of Honour, &amp;c., discovered—Grand flourish—Chamberlain, Falconer, with hawks and pole, &amp;c. King. Silence! Confound your flourishing, I say! It's that which frightens all the game away, I do believe! Those poor drums! how you whack'em! My ears have drums, you rogues, you! Would you crack'em? Prin. Dear father, 'tis to do you honour. King. Stuff! I have the honour to be bored enough; Haven't I toiled all day for nothing, child? I never knew the game so deuced wild— My woods no longer hold my pheasants fickle, My best preserves are in a precious pickle; The poachers have of late so much encroached, The hens are snared, and all their eggs are poached. Partridges fly as if the “Old One” called, The hares drop off and leave the fields quite bald. My land might form the subject of a sonnet, There's not one head of game, nor hare upon it; In short, girl, I shall have—as I'm a sinner, Nothing but fish and butchers' meat for dinner. Air—King—“Let gay ones and great”—“Love in a Village.” With gay ones and great, Over hedge, ditch and gate, From cover to cover we run; But game there is not, We can't get a shot, Where's the use of our dog and our gun? Enter an Officer. Officer. My liege! a person in fantastic habit Has brought your Majesty a splendid rabbit. King. A rabbit! You don't say so! Loyal deed! It is a meat on which we love to feed, Smother'd in onions 'tis the nicest thing— “A dainty dish to set before a king!” Admit him—stay—one rising doubt dispel— 'Tis not a Welch rabbit? Officer. No, Sire. King. 'Tis well! Waves his hand—Music—Officer goes out, and returns with Puss, with a wallet slung round his neck. Puss. (kneeling to King, and taking a rabbit out of his wallet) Most mighty Pumpkin, in my master's name, I lay before you this rare-bit of game. King. We do most graciously accept it—Here— See that 'tis cooked immediately, my dear. (Giving rabbit to Princess, who passes it to First Maid of Honour, who passes it to Second, who passes it to Third, who goes out with it, and returns immediately) And who's your master? Let us know, that we May thank him for his gift right royally. Puss. Sir King, I serve a noble lord, the great Marquis of Carabas. King. Where's his estate? We never heard of such a lord before! Puss. He has but newly settled on this shore, A foreigner of most illustrious birth, Allied to nearly all the kings on earth King. He's wealthy then? Puss. His riches are untold! Prin. Handsome? Puss. Almost too handsome to behold. Chat. Does he talk well? Puss. The most amusing chat. Skip. Dances, of course? Puss. A Vestris quite for that! Ar. Sings? Puss. Like a nightingale! he thrills one through! All the Ladies. How I should like to see him! shouldn't you? Puss. Might he present himself—he'd be too proud. 'Tis his petition. King. And it is allowed. Fetch him. Puss. I'm gone. (Exit Puss) Ar. Did you note that! Chat. O law! He wears a tail! Skip. “A demi-queue de chat.” Puss without. (—Help! Help! Murder! Thieves! Help!) King. What cry is that? Prin. It spoke of thieves and slaughter! King. By Jupiter! There's some one in the water! Don't stand there like a pack of cold insensibles! Run! give assistance! Call my River Fencibles. (Exeunt some Courtiers hastily) Chorus. —“O dear what can the matter be?” O dear! What can the matter be? Dear! dear! what can the matter be? O dear! what can the matter be? Somebody's drowning, I fear! Arietta. I heard the young man call for help, for his master The Marquis has met with some shocking disaster! O Gemini! why don't those fellows run faster? The water's all the over the peer! Chorus. O dear, what led him to it, pray? Dear, dear, did he try to wade through it, pray? Or, go, on purpose to do it, pray? Tell us how chanced the affair? (Enter Puss) Puss. His lordship, while bathing where yon river flows, sir, Was suddenly seized with the cramp in his toes, sir; Some rascals meanwhile ran away with his clothes, sir, He hasn't a rag left to wear! King. O dear, what impropriety! Unfit for decent society; Dear! dear! none can deny it, he Can't appear so very bare. Chorus. O dear! what impropriety! &amp;c. Prin. But he is safe. Puss. Of that, ma'am, there's no doubt. King. Say, does his anxious mother know he's out? Puss. My liege! she couldn't know that he was in. King. Then, my good friend, it matters not a pin About his clothes. Quick, let my pages run With a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of un— In short, with everything his lordship needs. (Exeunt Pages) Puss. He's like a widow now, my liege—in weeds; But joy, at your great kindness, will possess him! King. He has been wrong'd, 'tis fit that we re-dress him. Puss. It is the highest honour he could choose To stand one moment in your royal shoes! King. He comes! Puss. Make way, there, for my lord to pass. Officer. (ushering in Ralph, richly dressed) Room for my lord, the Marquis Carabas! Concerted Piece—Rossini. Ral. Give a man but luck they say, sir, In the sea fling him you may, sir; So, as if the truth to test, sir, In the river I got a tumble, And out thus pops your servant humble In your royal raiment dress'd, sir; Here a daintier duck to see. King. Sir, I deem it a lucky stumble, Which such pleasure procures for me. By jingo, His lingo The moment he began, sir; So caught me, It taught me He was a nice young man, sir. Bar. (advancing) These ladies, Whose trade is But flirting through a fan, sir; Their net soon Will set soon, To catch this nice young man, sir. Ladies and Ral. Ah! no, no, no! there's no such luck On fortune's cards for me; Ah! no, no, no! this fine young buck For us will never be. King. Most noble Marquis and most wealthy peer, Lord (trying to recollect) bless me— Puss. (advancing) Carabas— King. (impatiently) Don't interfere! We have to thank you for a splendid rabbit. Marq. I have to thank you for this splendid habit, In doing which I merely do my duty. King. Sir, your politeness equals but your beauty. Marq. Your Majesty's most kind, but something there— If I may trust my eyes—appears so fair, That I should say, (your pattern, Sire, to follow) Your beauty (if she is yours) beats mine hollow! Prin. (aside) What a particularly nice young man! King. That fellow stopped us just as we began To ask where your estates lie,—tell us true. Puss. (advancing) They lie in all directions. King. So do you! Pray be more backward, sir, in coming forward. Where, say you? (to Marquis) Marq. (hesitating and correcting himself after each word) Eastward—westward—southward—norward. A song, to the air of “Jenny Jones,” was written for Madame Vestris by Mathews, and introduced by her here, but afterwards omitted, as it unnecessarily interrupted the action. King. A roundabout reply. Marq. I'm not quite clear, I must refer to my land steward here. (to Puss) Do tell the King where my estates are—elf. (aside) Then I shall stand some chance to know, myself. King. Well! let him speak. Puss. Your Majesty knows where Your crown lands end? King. We do. Puss. Well! 'tis'n't there. But take a line from thence, and drive along, Follow your royal nose, you can't go wrong; For every bit of land you see before ye Is his. Marq. (aside to him) Don't lie! Puss. (aside) I do but tell a story. King. What! every bit of land in our dominions! We shall beg leave to take some law opinions! Marq. You'd better take your own, 'tis less expensive; And law can't make my lands, sir, less extensive. King. There's sense in that; but we must see the grounds On which you found your claims. Marq. The grounds! Puss. (aside) O, zounds! King. My coach! We'll ride together, Marquis! Marq. (to Puss) There! You've overdone it! Puss. No, no,—don't despair! Make some excuse—no matter what—to stay him; I'll manage all if you can but delay him. Marq. Too proud, my liege, you and your lovely daughter To entertain; but I've been in the water, And now I'm dry, nay, hungry, if you please, And first should like a crust of bread and cheese. King. I'm hungry too; so if the rabbit's done, Suppose we dine at once. It's half-past one— We'll make an early meal—despatch it soon, And take a cool ride in the afternoon. Marq. (to Puss) I dine with King and Princess! Puss. (aside to him) Mind my charge; Small talk to her, and to her father large. Marq. Sweet Rosebud! I shall die if I don't win her! King. Sound trumpets! Gentlemen, let's in to dinner! (trumpets) Solo and Chorus from “Joan of Arc,” Balfe. Marq., &amp;c. Hark the trumpet plays, come to the bower, The turtle smokes in the tureen; The rabbit, immersed in a shower Of onions, can scarcely be seen. But dainties in vain they shew, With yon fair in mine eye, To other fare I say but “No! For her alone I sigh.” Chorus.—Hark the Trumpet,” &amp;c. Puss in going is stopped by the three Ladies. Exeunt all but Puss and the Maids of Honour. Chat. Don't you run away—we don't dine yet, and I want to have some talk with you. Puss. Too happy. (aside) I must'n't seem in a hurry. (aloud) I can talke about what you please now. When I was young I could say little else but mew; but now that I'm a man I can talk beaucoup mieux. Chat. You're in the army, I presume? Puss. No, ma'am. Chat. Why, you wear moustaches. Puss. Yes, ma'am, yes; but that's because—because I can't help it, you see. I belong to a club, and all the members are obliged to wear them. Chat. What club? Puss. It's a sort of Catch Club. Ar. What, musical? Puss. Very. Ar. And where do you meet? Puss. We meet alternately upon each other's roof. Skip. Upon each other's roof!—that's quite a new step. Puss. I beg pardon, did I say upon?—I meant under. Ar. You can sing, then? Puss. I can squall a little, à la Cat-oni.. Ar. Who taught you? Puss. Cat-alani. Skip. And dance, too? Puss. I remember the time when I would have run anywhere after a ball. Skip. What is your favourite dance? Puss. The Cat-alonian Cat-choucha. Chat. Well, never mind about singing and dancing; suppose we fix upon some game to pass away the time, at which we can all play? Ar. I'm content. Skip. And I. Puss. And I. What shall it be? Chat. “Puss in the Corner.” Puss. No, no, I don't like that. Chat. Choose one yourself, then. Puss. My favourite game is “Cat's-cradle.” All. Oh, no, we can't bear that! Chat. Come, name another from your catalogue. Puss. (aside) Cat-alogue! They grow personal! (aloud) Ladies, you'll allow me to remark that you are not quite so polite as I should have expected Maids of Honour would be. Where I was brought up, the maids were much more kind to me;—let me play as I liked, and gave me every morning a great saucer full of milk—no, I don't mean that —I forgot what I was talking about. (turns from them in confusion) Chat. A saucer full of milk! What a strange tale—and —and—à propos of tales—pray, my good sir, who's your tail-or? Puss. (turning quickly) Eh!—oh!—ah!—you allude, I suppose, to—oh, that's nothing but—a something—which I wear— Chat. In compliance with another regulation of your club, I presume? Puss. Exactly so: it's a club-tail. (aside) How shall I get away? Ah! lucky chance, here comes the Marquis to relieve me. Re-enter Marquis hastily. Marq. I'm in a hobble which seems past all cure. Where can my man have got to? (pushing aside Ladies) All Three. Well, I'm sure! Marq. I beg your pardon, ladies, don't abuse me. (Exeunt Ladies) I'm in a hurry, and you must excuse me. (aside to Puss) The King's impatient, what is to be done? I rather think we'd better cut and run. Puss. Take to your heels? Upon my soul you shan't; I'll find some hole to creep through if you can't. Marq. You'll find some hole to creep through—doubtless—yes, But who's to help your master through the mess? Puss. Your faithful Puss, who never will desert you, But lay down his nine lives ere aught should hurt you. Marq. What, all at once? Alas! my Thomas Cat, The fates preserve thee from a lot like that. Of nunkey's goods and chattels all bereft, I've nothing left but— Puss. Puss. Marq. You're right—you're left. Song—“My Friend and Pitcher.” The wealth he own'd, his mill and store, My brothers shared, for so 'twas written; To me, alas! he left no more Than this, my faithful friend and kitten. But mortal ne'er Had cat so rare, With him 'twere hard to be grief-bitten, Then add but her, I ask no more, Than my sweet girl, my friend, and kitten. Here comes that plaguy Pumpkin! the deuce take him! Tell me how I shall manage off to shake him? Puss. Follow my steps, as well as my advice, And I'll arrange this business in a trice. Marq. Enough—I trust to you; make no faux pas, But pull us through this matter with é-clat. (flourish) Re-enter King and Court. King. Our coach and horses! Officer. Sire, they're at the door. Puss. May it please your Majesty, I'll run before. You've nought to do but keep the high road straight— 'Twill lead you to his lordship's castle-gate. (to Maids of Honour) From your sports, ladies, I am no seceder, I've only changed the game to “Follow my leader.” Chorus—From “Amilie, or the Love Test,” Rooke. Let's be mounting Let's be mounting! Let's be mounting! Away! We've a pretty long journey before us to-day. To the land's end, to the land's end, it seems we may trot, Would we see the land's end which his lordship has got! Marquis and Puss. Let's be mounting, &amp;c. You've a pretty long journey before you to-day. To the land's end, to the land's end, indeed you may trot, Ere you see the land's end which my/his lordship has got! (Exeunt King, Marquis, and all but Puss) Puss. Now then to lead them on their wild goose chase, And prove the thorough goodness of my race. (Begins running—Castle moves off and Panorama commences) Song—Puss—“Venetian Furlano.” I must scamper away, and be active and wary, There's naught like a cat to look out for a squall; My master and I are both in a quandary, A dairy I don't like at all. La, la, la, &amp;c. Music—The Panoramic scene shews the high road, passing through a varied country; villages, &amp;c.,—and at length a corn field with Reapers at work—Puss ceases running and the scene stops. Enter Reapers. Puss. Hark-ye, good reapers, if you don't tell the King, who will shortly pass this way, that all this corn belongs to my Lord Marquis of Carabas, you will be chopped as small as mince-meat. Music—The Reapers in alarm promise obedience—The scene moves on again as Puss recommences running and singing, and shortly exhibits a Hop Garden—Puss and the scene stop. Thus upon the highway it may be very pleasant For some folks to gallop for so many miles; But I own I see nothing to equal at present The higher way over the tiles. La, la, la, &amp;c. Enter Hop-pickers. Puss. (to Girls who are picking hops) Hark-ye, my little dears! If you don't tell the King, who will shortly pass this way, that all these hop-gardens belong to the Lord Marquis of Carabas, you will be chopped as small as mince-meat! Music—The Girls promise to obey, and the scene moves on Puss running and singing, till it shews a thick forest with Wood-cutters at work—Puss and scene stop. How provoking to think, that tho' born upon four legs, I've but two in which to confide, If, instead of these arms, I had only two more legs, They'd take two more feet at a stride. La, la, la, &amp;c. Puss. (to Woodcutters) Hallo, my fine fellows! If you don't tell the King, who will shortly pass this way, that all these woods belong to my Lord Marquis of Carabas, you will be chopped as small as mince-meat! Music—Wood-cutters promise to obey—The scene moves on, Puss running and singing, and finally discovers the Seashore and a large picturesque Castle, with moat, drawbridge, &amp;c., the windows of the building all blazing from the last rays of the setting sun—The scene and Puss stop. Faith, I'm almost done up! I'm afraid I shall drop From exhaustion, and down in the gutter come spank; I wonder, I'm sure, that the river don't stop, From this terrible run on its bank. La, la, la, &amp;c. Puss. O ho! this seems the island's end to be, To run beyond it were “felo de se!” I have run till I'm almost out of breath, And very nearly in at my own death! Therefore this place I shall take leave to stop in; There's a fine castle too—suppose I drop in, And see who owns it. 'Tis the very thing My master wants—at least to shew the King— 'Twill be hard if I can't get in, and harder, When I am in, if I don't find the larder. (Music—Runs into Castle)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. —Gallery in Ogre's Castle. Enter Kitchenstuff with a bundle in his hand. Kit. This is an Ogre's gratitude—to be turned away at a moment's warning, after so many years' service! It serves me right for being cook to a cannibal. If I know what to do I'm dished: no respectable quiet family will hire me when they know where I lived last. And there are so few Ogres to be found now, that I don't know where to seek another. What they do with all their relations I can't guess, unless they eat 'em! I mustn't stay here, however, that's quite clear. (going) Enter Puss hastily, at window. Puss. Here's somebody at last! Who are you; what are you; and where are you going? Kit. I'm the late cook. Puss. What, are you dead? Kit. No—I'm the late cook of this establishment; I'm discharged. Puss. Serve you right, a cook should never be late. Where are you going. Kit. On a voyage of discovery—in search of a new place. Puss. You Cooks are always going on voyages of discovery. What's your name? Kit. Kitchenstuff. Puss. Kitchen nonsense!—you don't mean that? Kit. No, I mean Kitchen-stuff. Puss. And what's your master's name? Kit. Killmany O'Gobble Killmore. Puss. What a horrible name! What is he? Kit. An Ogre. Puss. A what? Kit. An Ogre. Puss. I say, which is the way out? Kit. The way I'm going. Puss. Stop a moment. I must know something about this master of yours. Do you mean to say that he really is an Ogre? Kit. Yes; a great Irish Ogre. Puss. What! one of those fellows that eat naughty little girls and boys? Kit. Like oysters, by the dozen! Puss. The Cannibal! and what has he discharged you for? Kit. A mere nothing. Just because a young blockhead that I dressed for his dinner yesterday had no brains. Was that my fault? Puss. Certainly not! If I'd been his cook I'd have poison'd him! Kit. I had a great mind, but was afraid of making a mess of it. Puss. I've a great mind to try for the place, and do it now. Kit. You'd have the thanks of the whole island if you succeeded, and there's millions of money in his strong chest. Puss. Then if his stomack isn't stronger than his chest, I will. Kit. I should tell you, he wears a magic ring. Puss. Which protects him? Kit. I don't know that it exactly does that; but they say he can change himself into whatever animal he likes with it. Puss. Aha! Then I spy another chance. (Ogre roars within) What the devil's that? Kit. That's he roaring. He's got the gout, and is boiling over with pain and passion. Let him stand till he's cool; then stir him gently; put in a spice of flattery, by way of seasoning, and serve him out as quickly as possible. Puss. I'll risk one of my nine lives in this venture. A cat is sure upon his legs to fall; And so, my worthy friend, here goes at all. Kit. Farewell We may no more each other see! Puss. The Fates avert such a catastrophe! (Embrace—scratches Cook, who runs off—exit Puss)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Sixth. —Hall in Ogre's Castle. The Ogre discovered seated in his great chair of state—He is very fat and gouty. Ogre. The devil fly away now with the gout, For making both my legs so mighty stout. Fatter I grow each day instead of thinner, Although I eat one baby less for dinner. But that's my doctor's fault;—he can't be right, To baulk so elegant an appetite; I've a great mind to tear him limb from limb, And with some salt and pepper swallow him; Eat him, by way of proving to the elf How he'd the starving system like himself; Thus giving of my quality a sample, To doctors all a terrible example! (scratch at door) There's some one scratching yonder like a cat. Come in, you brute!—Come in, I say. Who's that? Enter Puss. Puss. (remaining close to the door) It's only me. Ogre. And who is me, say I? Puss. A person come for the cook's place to try. Ogre. Approach, and don't be frighten'd at my look; I like my meals too well to eat my cook. Besides, if I had been inclined to eat one, Make yourself asy, I'd have ate my late one! Puss. Was he the worst, sir, that you ever had? Ogre. Why very nearly almost quite as bad. Don't be alarmed. Puss. I'm not, sir, in the least. (aside) He frightens me to death, the nasty beast. Ogre. Approach! and don't be in a flutter, man, Who told you of my place? Puss. The butter-man. Ogre. In the first place, how long, in your last place, Were you allowed to shew your ugly face? Puss. Born in the house, I left it not till master Died and left me,—an unforseen disaster. Ogre. That sounds well. Can you stand the kitchen fire? Puss. I've sat before it, sir, for days entire. Ogre. Can you dress children? Puss. That is not my trade; A man-cook cannot be a nursery-maid. Ogre. Out, you spalpeen!—I don't mean wash and beat 'em! Ar'n't you aware, you devil! that I eat 'em? What kind of school have you been brought up at? “The Child's Own Book” would teach as much as that; But people's grown such wonderful big gabies, They doesn't know that ogres feeds on babies. Puss. I beg your pardon, sir,—I quite mistook you; You may eat safely—all that I shall cook you. Ogre. You'll find your tea and sugar, mind, young man. Puss. (aside) Yes, and my milk, as usual,—where I can. Ogre. I give no wages, so they're never due; The doctor's lowered me,—I'll hire you! And now, before you take yourself away. I'll tell you what to send me up to-day: You'll find a negro in the safe;—go, take him, Into an illigant black pudding make him. I've lived too much, they say, on white meats lately, And need a change of diet very greatly. What are you staring at, you thief you—fly! Puss. That ring, 'sir. Ogre. It's a beautiful cat's eye! You never see'd the likes on't, I'll be bound. Puss. My little brother, sir, had two, that's drown'd. Ogre. Drowned! Puss. Yes, in a pail—they let the water drop on him, And then the cruel creatures put a mop on him. Ogre. Your brother never had two rings like that— It's scarcer than a tortoise-shell Tom-cat. This ring can change me, with the greatest ease, To any sort of animal I please;— A lion, for example. Puss. Oh! a lion Must be a fearful brute to cast one's eye on. (aside) If he'd just turn himself into a mouse, I'd pretty quickly be about his house. Ogre. Stand clear, now, and I'll shew you just for fun, A lion shall astound your mother's son; (Music—The Ogre disappears and a lion is seen on table) Ar'n't you astounded? Puss. No—not in the least, To see you as you now are—a great beast; But that a mouse or anything so small, You can become, I can't believe at all. Ogre. You can't, you fool! Music—The lion disappears, and a mouse is seen in its place on the table. What think you of me now, sir? Puss. I think that you're a mouse—but I am a mouser! Leaps upon mouse, and then catches it up in his mouth and shakes it—Music gong—The Fairy Felina appears upon Ogre's chair, Puss carries the mouse to her, and drops it dead at her feet. Fairy. There's a good puss. You've done a glorious deed! 'Tis a great catch, and shews your famous breed. The ring which on this mouse's leg you see, (taking up and shewing mouse) Was pilfered by a hostile sprite from me. Complete your service to Felina's friend, And on her aid and gratitude depend. (Music—Fairy vanishes through chair) Puss. Here's luck! Now, master, I my word can keep! What, ho! ye varlets! are you all asleep? (Enter four Servants, six Pages, and Cook) Rejoice! The Ogre's dead! and his young heir Arrives to take possession! Quick, prepare A ball and banquet, which shall all surpass, To welcome home the Marquis Carabas!— The King comes with him. (trumpets without) Trumpets They approach! Run quick! ye knaves! and meet the royal coach. (Music—they run out) O glorious move! By this I check stern Fate, Castle the King, and give my lord a mate! Enter Marquis. Marq. What may this mean? Puss. The Marquis of Carabas is right welcome to his castle. Marq. My castle! How have you managed it? Puss. I can't stop to tell you now, sir. I'm going to invite his Majesty, the Princess Rosebud, and the whole court, to a ball and supper. (Exit Puss) Marq. I'm all astonishment! When first I came before this castle fine, I little dreamed it would so soon be mine; The frowning turrets to my anxious sight Appear'd to say, “You don't lodge here to-night.” “You don't lodge here to-night, Mr. Ferguson,” was a cant phrase at this period. Suspicious, willingly, I would not be, Yet fear this cat makes a cat's-paw of me. (Exit) Music—Re-enter Puss, in a rich robe, and with a white wand, ushering in King, Princess, Ralph, Baron, Maids of Honour, &amp;c. All bow. King. Marquis, of your vast wealth no more a doubter, We own your castle is an out-and-outer. Marq. Proud of your praise, my liege;—but pray be seated; After your ride I fear you must be heated. (Puss ushers King to chair of state) King. Lord Carabas, of Justice we've the bump, And freely own that you're a slap-up trump. (rising) Now be it known to all men that we burn To make this nobleman some great return For having (for it's no use words to mince) Invited and received us like a prince; So as he seems to love our daughter here— (aside to Princess) And to be richer far than us, my dear— The match is equal, and we are content To let him wring from us our slow consent. She knows we always let her have her way, When it agrees with ours; so, child, what say You to his plea, to which we don't demur? Prin. I shall in all my best obey you, sir. (to Marquis, and giving her hand) The breath of duty fans the torch of love; So, Marquis, pray accept my hand— Marq. (taking it) And glove! Yet, hold! although Joy's cup is at my lip, Justice must set it down before I sip: Your kindness to a simple unknown youth Touches my heart, and makes me own the truth. I'm wealthy, Sire, but neither Marquis nor At all the kind of man you take me for. This morning, sir, I scarce was worth a rag. Puss. (aside to him) Pray, sir, don't let the cat out of the bag! King. No whispering. There's treason in this mystery! Speak out! This instant let us have your history! Tremble!—to hoax us, if you've been so bold. Marq. My humble story in two lines is told:— A jolly miller once had nephews three, The youngest of them you behold in me. These lands are mine, though not by public sale; My cat knows all—but thereby hangs a talc. King. A miller and his cat! With rage I burst! Marq. I've told you all, sir—now you know the worst. King. The worst, indeed! Why, here's a pretty scrape! We've had a most miraculous escape! Marq. It rends my soul to part with so much beauty; But mends the hole, to think I've done my duty. King. Would'st catch a princess as you would a mouse? Away! We turn ourselves out of your house. Marq. As, without her, I ne'er could live at ease, I'd rather turn myself out, if you please. King. 'Twere better so! Prin. Oh, father! call him back! Though he's a miller, don't give him the sack! Spare your poor daughter's heart this cruel shock; He's proved himself the flower of the flock! Sweet miller, I am yours! (Throws herself into his arms) Marq. Ah! say you so? Then thus will I defend you 'gainst each foe! (drawing his sword) King. Ho, knaves there!—part them! What are you all at? Arrest this Marquis, and hang up his cat! The Guards and Courtiers seize and separate Marquis, &amp;c.—Thunder and lightning—The back of the scene opens, and discovers the Fairy Felina on a large cat. Fairy. Hang Puss in Boots! Thou pompous fool, forbear! Puss is my subject—touch him if you dare! Forgive them, too—or, by this magic ring, Thou shalt remain a goose, but not a king! King. I'm not the goose, ma'am, that would run contrary, In an affair that's managed by a Fairy. So let the old line end a tale of laughter— (to Princess and Marquis) Be married, and live happy ever after! Finale—“The girl I left behind me.” Marq. The King he bids us happy be, With him my notion pat jumps; And so I come, kind friends, to see, With you, which way the cat jumps. If we once more have waked some fun From Mother Bunch's fine tales, Let those who've played with her cat's one, Escape your cat-o'-nine-tails. King. To you we therefore move our suits; Say—shall the task be fruitless? The labours, sure, of Puss in Boots, You will not render bootless! To call for actors now appears The fashion;—then let that call To-night, ye critics, calm our fears, And be your only cat-call. Puss. The proverb says, “Care kill'd a cat;” Acknowledge 'tis but fair, now, You should permit, in change for that, A cat to kill dull Care now. If once to-night I've made you grin, Oh, in return for that laugh, Allow us just applause to win Enough to make a cat laugh! Marq. But hold! before we raise for good And aye, our voices choral, It just occurs to me you would Perchance say, “Where's the moral?” 'Tis this: if you're but left a cat, And, like me, can't well boast on't, Learn, friends, to be content with that, And try to make the most on't. Chorus. 'Tis this, if you're but left a cat, And, like him, &amp;c. CURTAIN.</field>
