      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Verona, Prospero, Montescelso, Cosmo. Ver. Maturity and age have now at length Imposed on me a carefull providence Both for my Dukedoms safety, &amp; the good Of our most hopefull Son Prince Prospero. Pros. My Lord. Ver. You grow to ripenesse, and my thoughts are fix'd To have you troth-plight to some noble wife, That in my aged yeares I may have comfort In your faire issue, I would have you marry. Pros. Marry my Lord! Ver. I, marry Prospero. I have labour'd with a neighbour Prince, possest Of a faire Daughter, to confirme a match 'Twixt thee and her, and 'tis concluded firmly; Her name Valentia, she his only child, By which a setled League grows 'twixt our Dukedomes, And thou by this art the true hopefull Heire Of both our rich and wealthy Provinces: Your answer. Pros. I am free, my Lord, as th'uncurb'd aire, That comes not within limit, as the light That nothing can imprison. Shall I truly Speake my own thoughts, and not dissemble with you? I that am free 'mongst men, and uncaptiv'd To any, save the duty bound to you, Am loath to make my selfe a womans slave, Briefely, my Lord, I have no mind to marry. Ver. Not marry boy? Oh, knew'st thou what a sweetnesse And harmonie's in loves blest fellowship Thou wouldst embrace it gladly; this blest union, This true-loves knot the Gods themselves do tye, And none but death dissolves. And what's Virginity? A something-nothing, singularity Unsociable, so slightly reckon'd of That either Sex, but to thy number grown, Has a desire to leave it; be perswaded boy; Thou hast beheld the Picture, and it promises A perfect Lady; hadst thou seen the substance Thou wouldst condemne the workman for so scanting Her rare comparelesse beauty. Marriage, Why 'tis an honour, Emperours, Kings, and Princes, From the Pallace to the Cottage held it sacred And in a high religious reverence. Pros. Well, my Lord, I will be steer'd by you; Even through the turbulent Ocean of this life, Where many dreadfull tempests threaten us, I shall be swai'd by you, and entertaine This sweet captivity. Ver. Then art thou wiseâthe news. Flourish. Mon. Embassadours from Mantua crave admittance Touching affaires of state. Ver. Admit 'emâ Enter Embassadours. Lords, your arrivall is in happy season; The marriage so long treated 'tween the Fathers Shall by the Children be confirmed at length, 'Tis now on foot. Em. Your grace mistakes the tenour, And the strange purpose our Embasie; The Prince our Master lets know by us That your alliance highly he disdaines, Contemnes your love and neere affinity, And for just reasons, to himselfe best known, Desires your opposition; for the marriage Treated between you, esteemes his Daughter Much undervalued, and not rated truly To her best worth. Ver. Pause Lord Embassadour, So high hath thy words incens'd our spleene, And set so just an edge upon our wrath That we want patience to bestow an eare Unto thy harsh conclusion: Tell thy Lord, We did not so much over-prize his love As here his hate held in the basest scorne; Nor can he so much undervalue us As we his Contracts and Confederacy; And for thy self-presumptuous Mantuan Lord, We favour thee to let thee undisgrac'd Depart our Court, be gone without reply, Not Matuans, but Mantua we defie. Emb. Let me conclude my Message. Ver. Convey him hence; Disdaine our fellowship! Mantua shall know His state shall lessen whilst our glories grow. Pros. I, but, my Lord, I hope the match is not broke off Betweene me and the faire Valentia. Ver. Oh boy, didst thou but know what marriage were, How full of troubles and contentions, Thou wouldst forgo it gladly; who that's free Would be confin'd to base Effeminacy? Pro. But that which hath made in me the deepest impression Is the rare Picture of the Lady Valentia. Ver. The Painter flattered her, in having her Thou hast a painted Mistris, of her selfe The Lady is mishapen and deformed. Pros. Nay, take me with you, my Lord, I have beheld her Picture, and it promises A perfect Lady; had I seen the substance I should condemne the workman for so scanting Her rare comparelesse beauty; these were your own words, My Lord, or I much misunderstood them. Mon. They were indeed, my Lord, I am witnesse to them. Pro. Well since your Grace has no purpose to have me marry, Shall I have your best furtherance to travell? Ver. Yes, any thing to weare out the remembrance Of Mantuas Daughter. Mont. Another boone, my Lord. Ver. What's that Coz? Mont. That I may be his Partner in his travell, his associate To beare him company, nothing else my Lord. Ver. Have your desires. Pros. I embrace your fellowship, Ile travell, but whither? to have a sight of the faire Valentia, There shall be the period of my Voyage; What though her Father and mine be opposites, she and I May happily agree well enough when we meet together. Mont. My Lord, what limit shall we have to play the wandring Knights in? Or how long shall it be ere we set forward on our Journey? We were best go well provided, for we must see Spaine, France, and England ere we returne. Ver. Some ten daies hence you shall set forward, Your stay hath a yeares limit. Pros. Then come, faire Coz, we must provide our selves; Her Picture's lovely, and it much contents, And I must see the face that it presents. Exeunt. Ver. Your youths cannot outstrip my gravity, I have you boyes, and aime at your intents; This cunning suit for travell is a colour To some close practice to deceive my age, But I shall wind them both, Cosmo. Cos. My Lord. Ver. The mannage of our State we leave to thee, Whom we know wise and gravely provident; Our purpose is to chase these travellers, Whose voyage we mistrust. Coz. 'Tis dangerous Unto your noble person, full of hazard And doubtfull perill. Ver. I am confident, Disswade me not, for my intent is fixt; In some suspectlesse shape Ile after them, And sound the inmost of their thoughts, yet passe unknown; Cosmo regard your charge whilst I provide Flourish. To find that craft they with such cunning hide. Exeunt. Enter Mantua, Embassadours, and Clowne. Man. You have breath'd defiance then. Emb. I have my Lord. Man. And how did he receive it? Emb. With such scorne And proud contempt, that with far greater spleene He threatned us than we could menace him. Man. No matter, this late difference pleaseth us, You have demean'd your selfe even to our wish, Now leave us to our private meditations. Exeunt. Em. Come hither Sirra, I repose in thee Much trust and much assured confidence, I have brought thee up of a youth boy, I have. Clo. You have if it shall please your Grace. Man. Thy Father was a good old servitour, I lov'd him well, I did, indeed I did, Beleeve it, for I did so. Clo. I beleeve your Lordship without swearing. Man. Thou knowst my Daughter should have been affied Unto Verona's Son Prince Prospero, I know thou knowst it. Clow. I have had, if it please your Grace, such an inckling, Man. But a difference since Hath falne betwixt us, nay, in such a manner That by our Leagers we have threatned war, And war is like to ensue to come to thee. Clo. If it shall please your honour, Ile save you that labour and come to you. Man. Conceive me, I will come to that concerns thee, Thou knowst how deerly I affect my Daughter, I, and how deerely I affect my Gold, Speake, did I ever yet part with one peece To guerdon thee, a signe I lov'd it well. Clo. No, never, if it shall please your honour, Ile do you right in that, you ever lov'd me too well to give me any thing, I have ever heard you reported for as covetous and niggardly a noble Gentleman as ever bore sway here, you are one of the most closse-fisted Carpenters that ever bare rule in Mantua. Man. To keep my Daughter that she marry not, By which I likewise may reserve her dower, I have devis'd this opposition 'Tweene Valentia and Prince Prospero; More Sutors are now resident in Court, But to prevent them Ile devise a Tower In which to shut my Daughter so impregnable And full of dores, of which Ile keep the keyes, That she in vaine shall strive to issue out, Or they to enter in; this strong foundation Is laid already, workmen are employ'd, And all things promise prosperous successe; In this employment thou shalt have a charge, An overseers place, because I know thee Simple but sure of faith: wee'l trust thy reach, As far from craft as cunning, truly honest Because not over wise. Clo. I must entreate your Lordship I may have a paire of Chopeens, or some high Cork'd shooes, or else I shall never play the overseer well; or if your Lordship will allow me but a Ladder, I warrant you I will oversee your workmen. Man. No more, there shall be order from our Treasury To furnish this rich buildingâ Enter Florence, Ferrara, Julio, Valentia, and Dutchesse. Welcome Lords. Fer. Our welcome would shew better, If we could heare it from the Ladies. Flo. They come well that speed well, if we could find our selves well sped, then we should not doubt to presume we were well-come. Man. Lord Julio, are the toyles prepar'd and set for our appointed game? Iul. They are my Lord. Man. Then Princes we devote this day to pastime And chasing of the Stag, these beauteous Ladies, That must this day take leave of liberty, Shall in our sport associate us; Valentia, And you most beauteous, and my dearest Love, I here protest my selfe your Guardian, Hoping to see you, ere two months expire, The Mantuan Dutchesse. Dutch. I hope no such matter; but my Lord, Am I your Deare, as you proclaime me? Man. My dearest Deare. Dutch. Then being in the chase I shall feare in the hunting To come neare you. Man. Your reason Sweet. Dutch. Lest being your Deare you should strike me. Man. Still is this Lady crosse to my designes, But time may worke her; Daughter, mount your Steed, And Lords to horse, the morning grows upon us, And steales towards midst of day. Val. We but attend Your Highnesse company. Flo. Lady, this day I will not start from your side Val. You'l be worse to me than a stitch then. Fer. Nor will I leave you Lady, Dutch. And yet you shall have free leave to leave me when you please. Man. We trifle houres, sound out your bugles sh[illeg.] And the thick aire with pleasing ecchoes fill. Exeunt. Iul. To ring thy knell, for this day thou art doom'd To perish by the hand of Iulioâ Hornes. The Mantuan Prince Is now upon the Chace, I heare the cry, But ere the stagg fall the proud Duke must dye. Exit. Enter Prospero, and Montecelso. Pros. Harke what a shrill applause doth welcome us Unto the Mantuan Confines. Mon. It seemes the Duke or some of his traine Are in the Forrest chacing some game; Nay, it must needs be so of necessity, they would not else make This noyse unlesse they were all horne-mad. Pros. If I should come a wooing, noble Coz, I should presage the Musick of these hornes Might, to my future match, prove ominous; But now let's mixe our selves amidst the Traine, And see what faire adventure may befall us. Mon. Sever our selves, it may be that sweet face Your Father prais'd may meet us in the Chace. Pros. I like well this division, come let's part, And let's be henceforth strangers, thus condition'd, The first that can prefer himselfe, or service Unto the Duke, or gaine his soveraigne grace Shall for his friend provide some eminent place. Mon. I am pleas'd my Lord, then come let's mount a way, Horns. The morning's old, and we shall lose much day. Exeunt. Enter Iulio with a Disguize. Iul. With these Italian tricks villaines oft maske Their grim bloud-thirsty fronts, and when they purpose To act some horrid murder, if prevented, Thus passe unknown, these bought I of a Jew, A fellow that professeth villaine; Ile dog the Duke, whom if I can but single, Or light on from his Traine, but thus, 'tis done, The Dukedome seiz'd, and faire Valentia wonne; Auspicious hell I thanke thee, thou art still True to black deeds, and friend to such as killâ Enter Mantua. Man. My horse hath fail'd me, and I forc'd on foot To lag behind, my Traine have left me all, Led by the musick of so faire a Cry, Ju. To find a place where thou maiest fitly dye. Man. Who named death to me? Iul. One whose powerfull hand Shall guide thy Dukedome, Daughter, and thy Land, And at one blow gaine allâ Enter Prospero. Pro. And we so nigh, The slave that threatned death himselfe shall dye. Iul. Prevented. Exit. Pro. Courage, my Lord, the traiterous groome is fled, And you ingirt with safety. Man. Noble stranger, The life thou hast given me shall be ever thine, And thanke the stars that brought thee to my rescue, They ow'd thee a great fortune, thou hast sav'd The Mantuan Duke from death. Pro. Are you my Lord, The noble Mantuan Prince? what Traitours hand Durst threat your life? Man. I know not, gentle sir, But for your selfe thus much presume from me, You shall be ever ours, to none more deare, By whom I am freed from treason, death and feare. Enter Iulio, Florence, Ferrara, Valentia, Dutchesse, and Montecelso. Iul. This way, my Lords, I saw the Duke in perill; An ugly slave, his face much Vizard-like, Assail'd the Duke, and with his weapon drawn Fled through the Forest, I pursu'd the Traitour Whilest I had breath, but feare and guilt of conscience Gave his speed wings; but see my Lord's in safety, Whose welfare I salute thus on my knee, Glad in my soule that he from death is free. Val. My Father threatned I blest be that faire hand That wrought his safety. Man. Thanke this Gentleman, This noble youth, 'tis he by whom I live, Never so neare my death, never so neare it, So mortall men are still when least they feare it. Val. Oh do but tell me, thrice renowned sir, How I may shew me thankfull to your love, Whose noble hand preserv'd my fathers life. Pro. Madam, your grace, your favour and good thoughts Are gifts above my merit. Flo. Stranger, thou hast wonne the opinion and suffrage of the whole Court, and bound the Prince of Florence to be thy gratefull debtor. Fer. We made hast To the Dukes rescue, but it was thy fate Our valours to prevent, we came too late. Dutch. Yet did Lord Iulio, with what speed he might, haste us to this great danger. Iul. 'Twas my duty And service to my Lord, whom thus to see Secur'd from death glads, almost frantiques me; Legs for my life I thanke, and thou my braine For making up this broken slaw againe. Man. We thanke you Iulio, chiefely you faire stranger, Whom for your service we will raise in Court, And breast next our most deare Valentia; But she is for the Tower bar'd with twelve doores, And this the last day of her liberty, That's our next businesse; once more welcome sir, Attend on us to Court, our happy fate Hath given me safety, and advanc'd thy state. Exeunt. Pro. Oh faire Valentia! Mon. My Lord, if you had been born lesse than a Prince, yet you have wrought your selfe into grace. Pro. Here set a period to our travels, make a full point here. Mon. And that, my Lord, is the full end of a sentence; but shall we give over travell till we have seen something worth seeing. Pro. Worth seeing sai'st thou? what's Valentia? Travell from Pole to Pole, stand at the Center And progresse round about the spatious signes, Or, were it possible, sit with the Sun In his high noon-tide glory, and from thence Survey the Kingdomes of this lower world, Thou canst not find her match, Apollo's haire Is dull to hers, her fingers, hand, eye, front. Mon. Take me with you my Lord: This marvellous thing you call her beauty, is it ought but ordinary flesh and bloud? Are those gold wiry haires with which Apollo might go string his Harpe, are they ought but the plaine haires of her head? Her Ivory palme, that doth in touching melt, embroidered with blew artires, is it ought but a Ladies hand and fingers? And this strange thing, this wonder of the world, whose peere cannot be found betweene the Poles, are not all these nine wonders in one, she that was here even now, the Dukes Daughter Valentia? Pro. Oh my deare Montecelso, this I know, But such an admiration hath surpriz'd The freedome of my senses, that it robs me Of my true judgement. Mon. Be advis'd by me: you love this Lady, but so strict is like to be her imprisonment, that you may as easily pass by the gates that Cerberus keeps, as through the doores of this Castle; you are already in favour with the Duke, do but preferre me to be overseer of the worke, if I do not worke it so that I will bring you to oversee her, turne me out of my office as one not worthy the name of an Architecture. Pro. I shall commend thee for a man well skill'd In such great structures, it may be the Duke May trust me on my word. Mon. And if I do not make him dote as much on you for your valour, as you make him enamour'd on me for my skill in building, may this Tower turne to the Tower of Babel, and make a second confusion betweene us, there remaines for you nothing but this, to winne the favour of the Lady; and for your accesse to her, if I do not teach you to counterfeit all the Dukes keyes, turne by all the wards of his locks &amp; lay open all the Jurie of his twelve doores that he hath pannell'd against your entrance, report me to be no man of my trade? Away my Lord, leave this melancholly, walke by her window, and cast sheeps eyes that way towards her Chamber, let me alone to stand Centinell and watch if the Duke come. Exeunt. Enter Clowne, a Smith, a Mason, a Bricklayer, a Carpenter. Clo. Come on my masters, the Duke has appointed me to be Overseer of his workes, the building of this Tower is put to my indiscretion; therefore come every one of you, and from me take your directions; what are you? Ma. I am a free Mason, and expert in squaring stone. Clo. A good proper square fellow, if your trade be in stone, I make no question but you will worke hard. Ma. I warrant you sir Ile do my endeavour; will you give us directions? Clo. First you must make a faire large post at the entrie. Ma. I warrant you Ile make a large porch that any Lady shall go in and out at pleasure. Clo. To see how you mistake; you must make it that no body can go in and out at pleasure but only my Ladie, it must be too wide for any that's lesse than shee, and too strait for any thats greater than she, you conceive me. Oh sir, 'tis not possible. Clo. Tell not me of possible, such directions I had, and such an one I must have made: Then must I have faire bay windows that must alwaies stand open and give no light, that they that stand without and looke in may see no body within, and she that stands within and looks out may see no body without; the reason is, my Lord meanes to keep his daughter in that Tower, where she must neither see nor be seen. Ma. Then none must offer to looke out from the inside, nor in from the outside, else 'tis not within the compasse of workmanship. Clo. Tell not me of workmanship, such windows I must have made: Now Carpenter for you, you must make the doores of that fashion that women may go in but men may not, and they must be of such wood as will not let a Lover come neare it, for my Lord will have no Lovers come neare his Castle. Car. Then you must have some body to keep them out; here are wise directions! Clo. For you goodman Padlock, you must hammer out your Locks and Keyes with such Art, that if the Duke, or any from him, offer to open, the Key may turne at pleasure, but if any Lover or suspitious person come to enter, Non sum, non possum, non Licet esse Domi. Smi. That's as much as to say, they must have no entrance there. Clo. Smith, you have hit the naile on the head; What's your place? Brick. I have the charge of the brick-worke, and must build the Chimnies if you would give me directions. Clo. Marry will I sir, you must have a speciall regard in your Chimneys that they cast heat, though there be no fire in them, and the Kitchin Chimney especially must every meale yeeld rost meat without sending to market, and so to worke for a spurt, and after merrily to dinner. Omnes. A good motion. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Mantua, Florence, Ferrara, Iulio, and Prospero. Man. Have you given charge, Lord Iulio, that may Dutchess Be nobly serv'd as her whom Mantua loves? Iul. I have my Lord. Man. And that Valentia be inclos'd and shut From all her sutors eies. Iul. I gave such order. Man. Enough now my Lords. Flo. You give us faire words; but keep us from the sight of the faire Ladies. Man. Soft and faire, soft and faire. Fer. We know they are both soft and faire, and that's the reason we desire so much both to see and feele them. Iul. I would beneath the groundsels of this Castle, By Miners craft, were plac'd some strong Petars, To which I would give fire and blow this structure Up into aire that prisons thus my Love; But Iulio peace, and some advantage wait To shew to her thy love, to him thy hate. Flo. My Lord, I can compare you to none so rightly as to the King Acrisius, that shut up his Daughter Danas in a brazen Tower, but you know the end of it, there was a Jupiter that with a golden pick-lock broke through those brazen gates, and made the maid a mother. Now if I were to choose a godhead, of all the gods that are Would I, for her sake, wish to be a Jupiter. Man. For men to be made gods it were a wonder, You Iove, and neither have his power nor thunder? Fer. Shall I baile her my Lord? Ile put you in good security. Ma. But not in better security than I have put her in already, Yet better would do well; oh for a man Skilfull in Architecture, and composing Strong frames and formes of building. Pro. Now's my question; My Lord, there is a stranger in your Court Whose outside though it promise not much Art, Yet is he so ingenious, and so apt, Of such opinion and direction too, That could you win him to be so imploy'd, As we shall hardly, for men excellent Are curious of their skill, you cannot find A man to match his skill in Italy. Man. Thou wert I see, faire Knight, mark'd in thy Cradle To do me all good offices, bring that man To my employment, I will guerdon him With more than he can aske. Pro. I, but my Lord, He is a man alwaies so absolute, And stands so much upon his excellence In fine contriving and rare edifices We shall have much adoe to win him to'tâ Ent. Mont. Here comes the man. Man. Sir, your due praise hath, like a harbinger, Gone all the way before you to provide you A place in my regard, you are most welcome, You have not seen my Castle? Mon. Yes my Lord, I have perus'd it. Man. What thinke you of the worke? Mon. 'Tis pretty, pretty; 'Tis well for moderne builders, homebred workmen, 'Twill serve: Yet let me tell you, worthy Lord, They never look'd on high Mausolus Tombe, Never beheld a Grecian Pyramis, Rich Crassus house at Rome, Diana's Temple At Ephesus, nor the grand City Caire, 'Tis well for them that are no travellers; Saw you me draw a forme, or a fine modell, The Fabrick greatly would enamour you, But yet 'tis well enough, pretty, not famous. Man. Shall I entreat you to direct my workmen, And I will weigh your paines down with reward. Mon. Your Tower as 'tis, my Lord, will serve the turne, Is finely seated, and to keepe your Daughter Close from the eyes of strangers, well contriv'd, Yet could I by a plot, but why should I Engage me in such worke? 'tis well already, Well, very well. Man. You can contrive it better, noble stranger; Make triall of my bounty, by mine honour It shall not faile your hopes. Pro. Did not I tell you at the first, my Lord, He would be wondrous dainty of his cunning? Man. So most men are in things they best excell; Shall I prevaile faire sir? Mon. Well, I am wonne To end that frame your workmen have begun; I have perus'd the scituation, Find it secure and full of able trust, Yet one defect I find: Could you pick out Some noble Knight, whose valour did exceed, To build for him a Lodging neare that Tower Where faire Valentia is to live enclos'd, He, as a Guardian, or a Centinell, Might keep continuall watch, defend the passage, And keepe the place strong and impregnable? Man. Where should I find a man worthy that place, Whose valour might supply this my employment? Iul. Let me engage my person to that businesse. Flo. Accept of me my Lord, Ile be her Guardian. Fer. Let the Ferrara Marquess be employ'd In this adventure. Mon. List to me my Lord: 'Mongst other quests, once as I travell'd Greece, There, at the sack of a most famous towne, I saw a Knight, now resident in Court, Do such high deeds of Armes, that living Hector, Had he surviv'd to see his Chivalry, Would from the Worthies nine have rais'd his name, To have eterniz'd him with golden fame. Man. In our Court resident? Mon. Yes, that strange Knight, What wonders have I seen him do in fight! Would he attempt it, all the plot were sure, Your Selfe, your Daughter, and your Tower secure; But you shall hardly win him to attempt. Man. That he is valiant I must needs confesse To my lives safeguard I have prov'd no lesse; Oh every way my friend; renowned Souldier, Pardon me that I have not done you honours Worthy your high deserts. Pro. Alas my Lord. Man. My eares are deafe unto excuse, and shut 'Gainst all deniall. Pro. I am exceeding loath. Man. I shall deserve it, noble Gentleman, I must not be deni'd, this skillfull stranger Shall cause my workmen build you a faire Lodging Next to the Castle, and adjoyning close Unto my Daughters Chamber: this is all; Can you deny me this? Pro. Your former honours Bestow'd so largely on my meane deserts Have been with me prevailing Oratours Upon your part, and I at length agree This skilfull Artist shall dispose of me. Iul. Againe prevented. Man. On all sides happy, fortunate, and blest, Now my disturb'd thoughts attaine true rest, Only one bar unto my best desires Is the intire affection and true zeale I beare the beautious Dutchesse. Pro. Oh my Lord, You have entertain'd the most affecting wooer In Europe, or the world, therein he's better Than in his Architecture, he's but young, Yet Tully ne're had such a fluent tongue. Man. Hem'd in with all felicities about, Having these helps what need I now misdoubt? You shall sir beare from me most kind commends. Mon. Who, I my Lord? Alas. Man. Come sir, you shall Unto the beauteous Dutchesse whom I love. Mon. You do not know my weaknesse. Man. You are strong In your acute words, and prais'd for your sweet tongue, A token I will send by you, that give her, And in your own sweet words my love deliver. Mon. If need's Ile do't my Lord: upon my life The provident Duke has found me out a wife. Man. Follow us Lords, I am full of jocund mirth, My feares are dead, my joyes receive new birth. Exit. Mon. Now Prince, was not this wrought out of Adamant? Pros. But what's the marke that all the severall arrows shoot at? Mon. This is the marke, marke it, I am made chiefe overseer of the worke, and your Lodging is directly against the Chamber of the Lady: Now will I appoint a private doore to be made through the wall, by and through which you may have accesse, ingresse and regresse at your pleasure. Pro. Thou hast builded in my heart a Tower already Of steady and firme hope. Man. Take my word I am excellent at Architecture. Pros. But touching thy employment with the Dutchesse, Art thou so mad to wooe her for the Duke? Mon. Yes, I will set him out in his lively colours, deale you as soundly with the maid as I will worke with the widdow, and I doubt not but we shall both live to be in the beliefe there are no Cuckolds but Batchelours, our stay is suspicious, be it your charge to hireâ A workman to make the private dore through the wall, And leave it to my wit to cover all. Pro. That be my care; Thou wooest a widdow, but I court a maid, The way thou tread'st is easie, broad, and free, But mine is strait, and danger ushers me. Exeunt. Enter Verona like a Pilgrime. Ver. No marvell though Jove often went disguis'd, And in his rurall habit trac'd the earth To heare and see th'affaires of mortall men. I being a Prince have in these lowly weeds Seen more than being resident in Court; But I am now in Mantua, and thus far I have pursued my Son by common tract; The Duke and I are dangerously oppos'd, And therefore this disguise must shelter me; The Mantuan Court Ile now search ere I go For Montecelso and my princely Sonâ Enter Clown with a rule and line. Clo. Let me see, let me see, make a doore so broad, I, so broad, and thus wide; now unlesse I had the Lady here to take measure of her 'tis impossible that ever I should make the doore fit; if a man take a thing in hand, it is for his credit to do it workeman like; now if I should make the doore too streight to pinch her body, or too wide to sit upon her like a sack, what credit should I have by my workmanship? Ver. Heaven save you sir. Clo. Et tu quoque my friend; let me see, let me see, now have I forgotten whether the doore must be made for her to come thus, with her armes broad waies, Pilcher-fashion, and a kembo; or thus side-waies, like a shotten herring. Ver. Sir, without interruption to your businesse, shall I entreat a few words with you. Clo. Hold here, hold here a little, thus high, I, thus high, just thus high; but now my friend, if I should make it just thus high according to my measure, and then the party being yet but young should grow higher, there were all the labour cast away; come, come, I must have a new measure. Ver. Sir, what means this? I understand it not, Pray let me aske you but one question. Clo. Hold againe, hold againe, say my friend I make it of this breadth according to my measure, just to a haire; very good my friend, but now the party being yet but leane that it should be made for, say the party hereafter grow fat, or as the Fox that when his belly was empty crept through a small hole into a henroost, and there fill'd his belly so full, that when he should come out againe, there was no roome; Colon was grown so great, and so poore Reynald was taken in the manner, no, my friend, this must not be. Ver. I pray sir to what end take you this measure? Clo. Why, my friend, because I would do nothing out of measure, I hope you have not plaid the old eaves dropper. Ver. No sir, but if your chiefe affaires be ended, Let me discourse with you. Clo. My friend, as you have lent a hand to my Line, so will I lend an eare to your tale. Ver. What's the best news in Court? Clo. Troth sir nothing but this, that the Prince is magnanimous, the Courtiers egregious, the Ladies beautious, the place conspicuous, and the building in hand most sumptuous. Ver. What strangers so journe there, what men of note? Clo. Troth sir there are only two, one is most brave at models and buildings, and hath undertaken a most brave peece of worke. Ver. That's not my Son, he never studied that, No, nor his friend. Clo. But there is another, the finest sweet-fac'd Gentleman, that sav'd the Dukes life in the Forrest, if you know not that you know nothing, if you know not him you know no body. Ver. What manner of man is he? Clo. A most dainty man, much of my size, he hath a most learing lip and tempting eye, there is only this difference between us, for you would take us to be brothers, but that he has more haire than I, and I more wit than he; Father, you are not worthy to be held a good Subject, if you love not him that had like to have kill'd him that would have kill'd the Duke, he hath set me about this peece of work here, let me see, this blockhead of mine will never bring it to any purposeâ Ent. Prosp. Oh here comes the Gentleman. Ver. He interpose himselfe and save the Duke! That looke, that face, that gesture is my Sons. Pro. Oh well incounter'd, tell me honest fellow, Hast thou dispatch'd the close and secret doore? Clo. Not yet my Lord. Pro. What dost thou with that Line? Clo. I am staying here, that if she should come down this way, I may take measure of her to make the doore fit for her body. Pro. Away you asse, thou wilt betray my purpose; But sirrah on your life use secresie, And with all speed dispatch it; but what's he? Clo. A Fellow that wonders so young a Gentleman as your selfe should take the Dukes quarrell in hand, and save him from the sword of a Traitour. Ver. 'Tis Prospero my Son, shape, gate, and voice, To heare his valour prais'd how I rejoice, Pro. This fellow at a blush looks like my Father, Such setled gravity lives in his eye; Nor is there wanting ought save power and state, Attended with the royall name of Duke To make him the same man; but I digresse; Come to your private taske, sirrah be secret, Or thy life paies for't. Clo. I warrant you sir, I would be as loath to hazzard my neck as you the Dukes favour, his favour once lost may be got again, but my neck once broke, Ile not trust all the bone-setters in Mantua to have it new set; feare not me. Fro. This aged man is still tost in my thoughts, And ever as I cast a look on him, His face grows more familiar with my eye; But to our taske in hand, why do we stay? His cloath of state cannot be turn'd to gray. Exit. Ver. Is this your travell Son? Oh heaven to see The follies and the vaine delights of youth, How headstrong, and how full of violence! Why should he take this way? why sojourne here Within my enemies Court? If to revenge My Injuries, why did he rescue him? Oh mine own Boy! I must commend thee yet that could'st win love Even of thy enemies, and honour'd fame 'Mongst those, that if they knew thee, hate thy name; Ile listen further till some fate bewray The full intent of his enforced stay. Exit. Enter Mantua. Man. My Daughter is securely clos'd and shut In my new Turret, and the noble Knight, As her bold guardian, hath his place assign'd, Those feares have end; now to my sute in hand, The stranger whom so late I entertain'd Is my sollicitor, and is directed To meet and court the Dutchesse in the garden, Where from this place I may behold their gestures, The manner of his courtship and conceit: How is my heart disturb'd 'tween hope and feareâ Enter Montecelso and Dutchesse. Comfort cold spirit, they now methinks appeare. Mon. The greatest instance of my love is, that I have given into your hands my liberty and life; my name is Montecelso, and that noble Gentleman that rescued the Duke Prince Prospero, Son to the Duke of Verona, it lies in you either to save me alone, or to destroy us both; give me no deniall, sweet Lady, rather kill me than disclose me to the Duke, so shall you lessen the supposition of your cruelty. Dutch. In that you are a stranger, I can no lesse in courtesie, nor more in modesty than to say you are welcome, though I have been trusted by many, I never betrayed any; I could call you rash to trust so rich a Jewel as your life unto the brest of a woman, but though you be so over-bold to presume upon me, I will not prove so over-cruell to tyrannize over you. Man. She talk'd a great long tale, and loud she spake, To her again, do not that answer take. Mon. Madam, by all the honours of a Gentleman, my love is as pure to you, and as free from blemish as is the element of fire, or the white robe of Innocence. Man. I know it is, I know it is. Dutch. All the comfort I can give you is this, the life you have committed to me shall be kept for you, the love you have proffered to me I will ponder on, I will never marry till you are bestow'd, nor ever assume the name of wife till you meet with a Lady to call you husband. Mon. Give me your hand of that. Dutch. I may well trust you with my hand that have trusted me with your heart. Man. A match I hope, for see, they now joine hands, My heart for joy upon the tiptoe stands; Follow it now, strike whilst the Iron's hot, I ne're was pleas'd till now with a fine plot. Dutch. But you forget in all this to speake for the Duke. Mon. Madam, 'tis true, I did forget my selfe, I must entreat you to thinke of him, but I do not entreat you to thinke well of him, as ill as you can possible; I beseech you love to be out of his sight in any case, and to love him best when he is farthest off: I would have you in all humility to honour him, but I would not for a world have you to marry him; have I yet spoke for him sufficiently? Man. Good, good, well spoken, and well acted too, He is not halfe so good to plot as wooe. Dutch. My Lord, the love we now celebrate betwixt our selves should once have been solemnized between our Parents, before these odds grew between the two Dukes. Mon. Though the Dukes be at odds, let us make even, Contracts are made on earth, but seal'd in heaven; Madam, let the Dukes love be the colour to our meeting: I must go tell him the manner, for with much longing he expects my returne. Once more let these our hands our hearts make sure, So thrive I as my love is chaste and pure. Exit. Man. Againe, againe, faire fortune be thy speed, Once more joine hands, and then 'tis done indeed; I knew the good Knight would not choose a man That should not fit my purpose, heaven I pray His place may take effect the other way, And his intents as prosperously proceed; But I must hence to meet him with all speed. Exit. Enter Valentia and Prospero above. Val. You wrong mine honour, and I shall complaine, I charge you get you back the way you came. Pro. Banish me heaven if you exile me hence; My deed, though it seeme rash, yet is begot In as pure birth as truth, and as upright As is the scale of Justice; I am free From all mis-thoughts, then do not banish me. Val. What are you sir? whence are you? what's your name? Pro. I am your friend, should you desire to know What my name is, alas my name's your foe. Val. Being my friend, and court me in this kind You should have come and left your name behind. Pro. I should indeed, my name is Prospero. Val. Prince Prospero, and the Duke Verona's Son, Our profest Foe? Pro. Give me some other name, Call me your friend and I am not the same. Val. Y'are not the same, you are th'advent'rous Knight That from the forrest-treason sav'd my Father. Pro. I was Prince Prospero when I rescu'd him, And so continued till I saw your face; But as my heart within your eye was tost, At once my hatred and my name I lost. Val. It was a kind foes part to save a foe. Pro. That kind foes part perform'd Prince Prospero. Val. Such a faire foe that no more hurt intends I should prefer before a many friends. Pro. Lady, we should have been espous'd together, But that our Fathers differ'd in the Dower; Shall Gold divorce them whom the soule of love Links in an endlesse knot? I for your love First hazarded my life to come disguis'd Only to view your face, next I contriv'd This private passage, known to none but us; If this deserve no love, no friendlie grace, Confine my life if banish me this place. Val. If nothing but the rescue of my Father Should plead in your behalfe; it deserv'd favour; But when your travell, and your fervent love, Attended with your feature and rare parts, Your studious meanes to compasse my consent And hazzard of your fortunes many waies, When all these plead together forciblie They draw me in a treble-folded chaine Your zealous love to pay with love againe. Pro. I left my name behind me at Verona, And now no more Prince Prospero but your Love; Weare this for me, and use in these affaires My art, feare not, I will devise a meanes To win your Fathers grant unto this match. Va. So we, my Lord, shall doubly be made friends, I take it as an earnest of your love, And hope of my release from this strict bondage; Accept of me interchange this Ring, My Father gave it me, keep't from his eye, Or he will end our loves by jealousieâ Pro. As I have been, I will be firme and sure, Long may the date of our chaste love endureâ Enter Iulio, Florence, Ferrara. Flo. I prethee, sweet Marquesse, since my successe is so bad with the Dutchesse let's walke by the Dukes new edifice, and see if we can take a view of the young inclosed Lady. Fer. Content my Lord, the Dukes strictnesse adds but spurs to my desire; for commonly what we are most forbid that still we most covet. Iul. Then should you with some engine raze these walls That interdicts your passage to that Tower; Had I such power I should enjoy such thoughts, But Iulio is a Subject. Flo. Now you put me in mind of such generous and noble thoughts, let's take a view of the Castle, and spy where it is weakest, that there, if hereafter we should invade, we may give the best and safest assault. Fer. Now you speake like a politicke Lover, come lets take a view of the building: But see, see, do you know him that's talking with the Princesse Valentia? Flo. Is't possible, Ile in and tell the Duke. Fer. Nay, leave me not behind, Ile second you. Iul. Introth Lad art good at that? you are a notable rascall, can you come to't So closely? is this your courage my couragious Knight? Ile see how Mantua applauds this fight. Exit. Val. We are descry'd my Lord, then post away, Get through the private doore. Pro. Feare not sweet Lady, Ile so blind their eyes, That we will still live free from their surprise. Exit. Val. Ten thousand times adieu, I am full of feare; Where love inhabits danger still draws neare. Ex.</field>

Then tell me, tell me, Didst thou with all thy best prevailing words, With all thy art, with all thy eloquence Urge her to love? speake that upon thy oath. Mon.

Iul. Emrbace her in his armes, and claspe her waste. Fer. She darting smiles at him, and the other. Iul. Nor did they blush, change face, or cease their Courtship, but stood as at the gaze. Man. Iulio, and Lords, You make me smile; have you so late perus'd The scituation, and observ'd the passages, And can you judge wit or the art of man Can force accesse there and not use my keys? Tush, you deceive your selvesâ Enter Prospero. Ha, ha, ha, come hither Knight and laugh with me At their three follies, they would needs perswade me They saw thee court my Daughter in her Chamber, Where thou didst publikely discourse thy fill, And yet these keys here at my girdle still. Pro. They did me the more wrong; I scale your Tower! It lies not in the reach of humans power. Man. I know it well, tush, while these keys hang here Were she faire Danas, I not Jove would feare. Pro. You Tower is stronger the Aerifius hold, Besides, I am not Jove to raine down gold. Flo. Is't possible my eyes should deceive me! Fer. Sure 'twas he, or the devill in's likenesse. Iul. There's in this some witchcraft. Pro. You might as well say that you see this hand Reaching as high as unto yonder clouds. Man. I should have seen that Ring upon that hand Once in my Daughters Chamber; oh my heart Why dost thou make such traffique with pale feare? Pro. He hath spy'd the gift, and knows the Ring I weare. Man. The same, the same, I will in and see The issue of my feares, twelve locks, twelve keyes, And every doore too double-barr'd with Iron, She in the inmost rome walk'd round about, It cannot be, and yet the Ring I saw Urgeth my feares, and forceth me withdraw. Exit. Pro. I know your, drift and must your speed prevent, But I delay; 'tis high time I were gone, Twelve dores the Duke must passe, and I but one. Exit. Flo. Shall I not trust my eyes? Iul. Though mine should faile me I would witnesse yours. Fer. It makes me past my thoughts. Iul. There's some strange jugling could we find it out: In all his acts yon stranger let us trace, And if we can, worke him some deepe disgrace. Exeunt. Enter Valentia above. Val. What hast thou done Valentia, given thy heart Unto a stranger, and thy Fathers foe? I wrong the Prince, who with a heart intire Pursues my spousall love with chaste desire; This match successefully begun may move Our Fathers hard hearts to a League of loveâ Enter Pro. Pro. Wonder not Madam at my serious haste, Your Father on my finger spy'd the Ring, And knowing it, is gone by the known way, Harke you may heare the doores. Val. Oh my sweet friend, Haste through the hidden way, leave it to me To excuse it, and retort his jealousie. Pro. Adieu sweet Lady, Harke, harke the last doore. Val. Deceit hath eyes behind, seems blind beforeâ Enter Mantua. Man. What so sad Daughter? Val. Not sad but solitary. Man. I see no private passage, and my dores Ranke in their wonted order; prethee Daughter Shew me the Diamond I gave thee last. Val. The Ring my Lord? Man. I the Ring. Val. Why, would your highnesse use it? Man. She moves a doubt, I feare there's guile, and I must find it out. Val. This is the Ring you meane. Man. I, 'tis the same; Oh my own Girle, fie my suspitious thoughts That you should lead me to these jealous feares, But Rings may be alike; my Deare, farewell, Thou shalt not long in this close prison dwell. Exit. Val. So Prospero hath promis'd, and Ile rather Trust him than you, although you be my Father. Exit. Enter Iulio and Verona. Ver. I have observ'd sir in your troubled looks Much discontentment, you seeme in your appearance To be some man of high and eminent place With the great Mantuan Duke. Iu. What's that to thee? Ver. Not much sir, yet out of a generous spirit In Pilgrims bred, such as I am profest, I would some cordiall counsels willingly Bestow upon you, did I know your griefes. Iul. I have in me a naturall melancholly; I have long aim'd at greatness, but betweene me And that high point two strangers stand oppos'd; Canst play the skilfull Surgeon? Ver. Sir I can. Travell hath taught me much, and though now poore, Yet in my better daies I have convers'd In Courts of Princes; would you grace me then But to prefer my service to the Duke, I would not doubt but to remove those objects That so offend your eyes; what are those strangers? Iu. The one a young Knight that professeth Armes: The other Architecture, both are frequent In the Dukes eare and I, that in times past Had all his bosome and his private thoughts, Scarce now remember how his Chambers hang, So seldome's my admittance. Ver. Had you so much interest In his past favours as to make my tongue Free to his eare I would remove those flatterers, And plant you in your first deserved grace; But might I see these Gallantsâ Enter Prospero and Montecelso. Iul. Here they come; The one I take to be a Conjurer, The other his Familiar that he works with, Ile shew thee reasons for't, Ver. Observe them sir. Mon. 'Tis true my Lord, this night the Dutchess lies in the Castle with the Lady Valentia, 'tis by the Dukes appointment, because she may be a comfortable kind Companion to his Daughter; now this night I have cast it so, that we will be merry with them till past midnight. Pro. But are the Ladies pleas'd it shall be so? Mon. The bargain's made and seal'd firme with a kisse, I set it fast upon the Dutchess lips; But come let's part till the appointed houre, We must not be seen too familiar together. Pro. Thou art my better Genius, I agree, I have no good but what I reape from thee. Mo. Farewel my Lord, only take heed of eaves-droppers. Ex. Ver. Did you heare that my Lord? Iul. Yes, and it strikes cold unto my heart; Must they this night meet in Valentia's Tower) The Devill hath made them picklocks. Ver. Patience sir. Iul. Bid me be frantique, rather raile and curse; at midnight must they meet? Enough, at that fixt houre Ile rouze the Duke, And put the Court in uproare, with his Guard âSiege round the Tower, and take these Incubus âMidst their lascivious pastimes. Ver. Heare me sir. Iul. I am deafe to counsell, patience, grace and all, Till in their midnight rapes these strangers fall. Exit. Ver. Oh were I now girt with a potent hoste Of mine owne people, and my selfe in Armes Engag'd unto his rescue, I could then Assure me of my noble Son againe; But I now feare his fall and ominous end, Whose help 'bove men to heaven I must commend; Yet Ile not hence, but note what shall ensue, Heaven heare my prayers, thou art to just men true. Exit. Enter Valentia and Dutchesse above. Dutch. Madam, this night devote your selfe to mirth, whilst your Father sleeps secure in his Palace, Montecelso hath promis'd to keepe his widdow waking; I assure you Prince Prospero will be here too instantly. Val. He cannot come unlook'd for, nor unwish'd, So long as their intents are honourable, So long their welcome is unquestionable. Dutch. Troth Madam we have exceedingly forgot our selves, we should have had a banquet to have entertained them. Val. Methinkes 'tis better as 'tis without, for the time, that should have been spent in sweet-meats to taste the Pallat, shall be now spent in sweet discourse to rellish the eare. Dutch. Fie, how long they stay, this houre is as long as three houres; I have observ'd one thing in Lovers houres, the time of their absence seemes hugely too long, and the time when they are present is three to one too short. Val. And three to one is ods, but you are an old woman. Dutch. That makes me long so much for a husband to make me even; what not yet come, nor yet? if they stay a little longer, I shall go neare to swoon thrice before they be ready to enter. Val. No entrance if you love me. Dutch. Yes at the private dooreâ Enter Prospero and Montecelso. Pro. Madam. Mon. Lady. Dutch. Imagine this night to be Saint Valentines day, when every bird chooseth her mate, for that is the season when they couple; I am here. Pro. And I here. Val. And I am glad, my Lord, that you are here; yet I would be loath, my Lord, have my Father know that you are so. Pro. That I am so seated, and you upon my knee. Val. Upon my knees I beg that it may never come to his eare. Mon. Come, what shall's do? Dutch. Say what you will my Lord, but do nothing I entreat you. Mon. If we should do nothing, of that must necessary come ill, Ile prove it too; of doing nothing comes Idlenesse, of idlenesse comes no goodnesse, of no goodnesse necessary comes ill: therefore if we do nothing, of necessity we must do ill. Dutch. How well, my Lord, you can infer ill; but, my Lord, if you should insist much in this argument, it were more to expresse your oratory than honesty; but my Lord, I know your vertues, and the opinion of them hath prepar'd you a most kind and loving welcome; we have nothing to entertaine you but words, and we can feast you with nothing but kisses; now you see your fare, fall to and welcome. Mon. Madam, I could everlastingly feed here, and yet presume never to surfeit, I can but thanke you, and now I have given thankes, Ile even make bold to fall to. Val. You say you could find in your heart to offend my father. Pro. I madam, so for my offence he would everlastingly confine me to this prison; why smile you Lady? Val. To thinke if my father should steale upon you, and find you here, what a cunning picklock he would take you for, he would questionlesse thinke you carried a false key about you. Pro. Tush, he hath made a Jury of twelve doores already to pass upon my cause, and they have all given my case up not guiltyâ Enter Florence Ferrara, Iulio. Iul. Where's the Dukes Guard? Flo. Begirt the Castle round. Iul. Her windows shine with lights like blazing stars. Fer. Th'are in her Chamber sure. Exit. Pro. Heard you that Madam? Val. We are betray'd. Mon. The Castle round beset. Dutch. And harke, above I heare the Dukes keys, down the private way, and leave the excuse to us. Val. Nay, when my Lords? Mon. This way my Lord, good night. Dutch. Nay, stand not now on triviall Complements, The Duke's at hand. Pro. Farewell, Ladies adieu. Exeunt. Val. Nay, if you love us leave us; Madam, how shall we answer this to the Duke? Dutch. Now my apron strings if I had one on, Madam take your Chaire and counterfeit your selfe fast asleep, so will I, not a word now if you love me. Val. Thy very words are better to me than a Physicall potion, for they have cast me into a sound sleep already; see I am fastâ Enter Mantua and Lords. Man. Soft, make no noise, the Chamber's whist and still, There's not so much aire stirring as would make The trembling Aspen shake; ha, fast asleep? Search round the Chamber. Flo. I find no man here. Fer. Here's naught but walls and Arras, and two Ladies In depth of sleep. Iul. Let's wake them my Lord and question them. Man. Not for thy head that hast deluded us, And to this shame and mockery rais'd the Court, Would I disturbe them of a minutes rest; Thy envy unto such as we have rais'd For their desert in Court hath stretch'd it selfe Even to our high disturbance. Iul. Hell and the furies, Am I againe deluded? Flo. Fie Lord Iulio, To call us in a mockery from our beds! Fer. Here to hunt shadows, sure the fellow dreamt. Flo. Pray my Lord wake them, and resolve them how Lord Iulio hath possest you. Man. Pardon me, They both are charm'd in silence, and their senses Confus'd in innocent dreames; I oft have heard That what a man or woman waking thinks, If they be question'd in their depth of rest Their Genius or their soule will answer for them, As their affections or their hearts inclin'd; Of this Ile make a true and prosperous use, And sound them how their humours are dispos'd, And to my Daughter first, Lords stand apart, How sweetly doth my Girle become her rest! How sound are her suspires! Valentia. Val. My Lord. Man. She answers me, now art thou happy Mantua, For thou shalt sound the utmost of her thoughts; Whom doth my Daughter most affect on earth? Val. I love none but my Father. Man. Oh mine own girle, and wouldst thou not have a husband? Val. Ile live and dye a maid. Man. There's no deceit in this, there's no dissembling, Shee cannot study for evasive shifts, I thanke heaven I am resolv'd: now Dutchess Your turne is next, Ile try how she likes me; What thinks the Dutchess of the Mantuan Duke? Dutch. As of a fine grave noble Gentleman. Man. Now she speakes her heart, this is plaine dealing; And couldst thou be content to marry him? Dutch. That's my desire. Man. And live his noble Dutchess. Dutch. I wish no better. Man. Mine own; Most sweetly may you sleep, and nightly dreame Of these positions, nor for halfe my Dukedome Would I disturbe their quiet; come let's leave them, Nay pardon me, Ile see the Chamber cleer'd. Iul. Could I be possibly thus mock'd? Man. Nay Gentlemen, Ile be the Porter, see I keep the keyes Of these two Jewels that I most esteeme; Iulio, beware hereafter you incur not Our wrath by these suggestions of untruths; Come Lords to bed I counsell you the best, Goodnight my girles, and sweetly may you rest. Ex. Dutch. Are they gone wench? Val. I, and so gone that till they have slept soundly, 'tis not possible to fetch them againe. Dutch. Now Endymions fortune upon them, that being once asleep they may not wake againe this forty yeares. Val. Was it not well apprehended of me to say I lov'd none but my Father? Dutch. And was it not as well seconded of me to say in my sleep I lov'd none but the Duke? Sure it must be in my sleep if ever I lov'd him, for yet I could never endure him waking; but what shall's do? Val. By my counsell let us even go to bed like loving bedfellows, and see if we can dreame of them that in time may become our loving bedfellows. Dutch. With all my heart, now the Duke is confident of our affections, we may be the freer in the entertaining of those whom we best affect; come, come, let's leave talking of this counterfeit sleep, and see if we can take a nap in sadnesse. Val. content, and let all men learne thus much from us, that sleeping or waking 'tis hard to o're-reach a woman. Exeunt. Enter Montecelso. Mon. Yet all things go currant; if the Ladies were as nimble in their excuse as we were quick in our passage through the private doore, I hope neither the Duke nor any of his Court can any way trace us in our proceedings; some Lovers would think me a most happy creature to enjoy the love of so beautiful a Lady, and for ought I know I may be so; but I have made a Vow never to marry a wife, but first to make some perfect and sound triall of her affection towards me; but because there is no woman that loves a man living, but she will infinitely lament him dead, it shall be thought that I have drown'd my selfe, of which I will give the Court some assured instance, and afterwards living hereabouts in some odd disguise, I shall truly understand how she takes my death; if in any extremity of griefe, I will revive her with as great a surplusage of joy; but if she take it coldly, as a business that little concernes her, Ile leave her to the mercy of him that bids fairest for her; and to my plot, I stay but for some company that may see me throw my selfe desperately into the River, heare my passion and report itâ Enter Clowne. Clo. My worke and every thing belonging to the Dukes building being brought to some good pass, I will study how to pass the time, and for the better recreation of my duller spirits take a turne or two here by the Rivers side to contemplate of the beauty of my Mistris; for indeed I am lately falne in love. Mon. No fitter man in the world to be the reporter of my death than this Coxcombe. Clo. Upon a morning when I rose to breakfast like a glutton, I don'd my doublet and my hose, and eate two legs of Mutton; Her bonny looks forget I not, nor teeth as white as amber, Her face did shine like pewter-pot belonging to the Chamber; My lovely Mistris I espi'd as she a milking went a, But oh me thought at every stride her smock that she had rent a; Full pale she look'd, for on her head a milk paile was well placed, Her lips were white, her brows were red, her body was straitelaced; But shall I now describe her legs, for I durst look no higher, She went as if she trod on eggs most softly through the mire. Mon. Now to my passion. Clo. But oh a place besides all these above both knees and thighs a, Which spring, as she look'd for fleas, did make my stomack rile a. Mor. Let Jove threat thunder, or bright Juno scold, Mars threaten Armes, arm'd in Cyclopian steele, Ile to my heels clap Boreas brazen wings, Or mounted on the back of Mercury With greater terrour scale the Olimpick heaven, Then when the Giants muster'd here on earth, And darted mountaine tops at Jupiter. Clo. What mad fellow's this? he hath driven me quite out of my meditations, pray heaven I fall not into his fegaries. Mon. But oh my beautious Dutchess, cause of this My frenzy, lunacy, rage, and despaire, I love thee dearely; yet because my fervor Shall no way cross the noble Mantuan Duke, I am resolv'd to dye. Clo. Of all the trades that are I love not this dying, poore Gentleman, would the Duke knew as much; but if love put a man into these perplexities, Ile take heed how I meddle with it, Ile e'ne shake hands with it, and part with it as it came. Mon. Whom do I see, the Duke of Mantua's Joy, She whose bright beauty enamours Jove himselfe, And makes him from his chrystall throne descend To 'bide with this faire mortal, thou art she. Clo. Not I I assure you, I am a man and no woman, if you will not beleeve me, I have a warrant about me to shew. Mon. Come, thou art she, wilt thou dissemble love? Clo. I am not she, looke here I have a beard. Mon. 'Tis but the perriwig falne from thy temples, And staies upon thy Chin, thou art my Dutchess; But stay, Ile place this border right againe, And set it on thy front where it should stand. Clo. Oh sir, Ile bring the Dukes own barber that shall take his oath upon a corporall book, that this is a beard and no perriwig; I am he that was overseer of the Dukes worke, and not the faire Dutchess that you take me for, put on your spectacles, and you will see I am nothing like her. Mon. Then she is lost, and I undone withall, Therefore Ile strip me to the Ivory skin, And as Leander did lively leape in, My head beneath yon River I will run, Neptune spread wide thy armes, for now I come. Exit running. Clo. Oh save the man, save the man, now he flounces, now he flounders, yet he swims above water like a walnut shell, yet he sprawles like a naked frog, yet he strives for life, oh save the man, save the man; but now, now, now he sinkes by degrees, now he is swallow'd, now he is choak'd, this is my comfort, he cannot choose but go with a cleane soule to heaven, it will be so wash'd in the water before he come thither. Againe, againe, againe; now he lies still upon his back and sloates along with the tide, and now his soule is in the skies, he doth not offer so much as to strive against the streame, but swims as gently down with the tide as may be; but what a foole was he, that knowing he should go so long a journey by water, and the weather so could too, would leave his cloaths behind him? Well, Ile e'ne take up his scatter'd Apparell, carry them to the Court, and there report what I have heard and seen, the poore Gentleman is well onward of his journey by this time, they had need provide him good store of faggots, for hee'l be monstrously wet when he comes to his Inne. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter Mantua, Florence, Ferrara, Iulio, Prospero, and Dutchesse. Man. Lady, I understand and good tidings from you. Dutch. From me my Lord? Man. 'Tis all one Madam, you at length are wonne Unto a second marriage. Dutch. Hath Montecelso then told to the Duke Of my free grant and yeelding to his love? Man. Sir, I must have you freely reconcil'd To the Lord Iulio that hath put upon you Such slanderous imputations. Pro. You my Lord Can much with me, but were't for the reverence I owe your Grace my sword had character'd My wrong upon his body. Man. Come, all friends. Iul. My Lord, I yeeld my selfe, and here confess In what high measure I have injur'd you. Dutch. That's too much to receive injury and make satisfaction too. Flo. He slandered you most vilely. Fer. Told the Duke You were safe lodg'd within Valentia's Tower. Flo. Made us to girt the place with the Dukes Guard. Fer. And at the high'st of night search all her Lodgings For you and th'Architector. Pro. But who found you? Flo. None but two sleeping Ladies, and they fast Surpriz'd in innocent dreames. Pro. Was this wrong To be endur'd? Man. Where the guilt's confest There pardon is soone purchast. Iul. Ile not beleeve But there's in this some jugling, some strange featâ Enter Clowne. Clo. Roome for a bringer of ill news, for one that brings a tale will offend all your noses, and a discourse that will distaste all your eares; who knows this Hat? who knows this Doublet? who knows this Cloake? Dutch. These were Lord Montecelso's; why my heart Art thou struck cold with feare? Pro. These were my friends. Man. If I mistake not these belong'd to him Whom I preferr'd to over-see my works, What news of him? Clo. You that lov'd him, out with your eyes, and wipe your handkerchers, and as you look upon this Cloake provide for a shower of raine. Flo. Speake, what of him? Clo. He is dead, he is fled, he is not wounded, but he is drowned, he is gone for ever, for he is leapt into the River. Dutch. Dead! Pro. Drown'd! Man. How came he drown'd? speake. Clo. Marry with water, belike it got into his mouth and choak'd him. Iul. There's one gone yet. Man. I meane discourse the cause that urg'd him to't. Clo. As I was walking by the Rivers side, musing and meditating on some passions incident to men of my complexion, I spi'd this Gentleman starke staring mad, exclaiming on the beauty of this faire Dutchess, saying, that he run mad for her love; but because he would not be false to the Duke his Master, that put him in trust, he would rather shew himselfe to be no better than a drown'd Rat than deceive him, and so very courteously casts away his Hat, very dolefully laies by his Cloake, very dissolutely hurles off his Doublet, very desperately leaps into the River, and very dangerously gives up the Ghost. Pro. It drives me to amazement, And I am wrapt in wonder. Dutch. Oh my Fate! I am of all the most unfortunate; Ile not out-live him. Man. Wherefore doth my Dutchesse Shew in her looks such sad distemperature? Dutch. I am lost, there steales a coldnesse through my bloud, The Icy hand of death plaies on my breasts, And where it toucheth turneth all to earth, And I am doom'dâ Iul. Look to the Lady, see she faints. Flo. How cheare you Lady? Dutch. Ha, am I call'd againe? Then like a soule disturb'd in her departure, And kept from rest and downie quietnesse, Let me proclaime my anguish. Fer. Patience Lady. Dutch. Ile not be patient, give me leave to drowne My soule in brine, and in a floud of teares Swim to my Love. Man. The Dutchess is distracted. Dutch. I am so, I am desperate, frantick, mad, Go call yon Architector from the deeps, And he shall build a Castle in the aire, Where we will live together 'midst the Clouds And laugh at these poore mortals here on earth. Iul. The Ladie's mad. Dutch. You are deceiv'd, not I; Cannot a Lady weepe, mourne, or lament, Or spend a few teares o're a funerall hearse But you will judge her frantique, pray give leave, Which of you here can hinder me to weep? I am a woman. Clo. I am a man. Dutch. Women command teares, Then pray let me bestow some on a friend; If you will dye go hang or drowne your selves, Ile do the like for you. Iul. Yes, not for me. Dutch. Why should I weepe for thee if thou didst so, Or thee, or thee, or any dotard here, Yet if you please you may go try for me, Ile clap at that well-acted Tragedy. Exit. Clo. Oh save the woman, save the woman. Man. Follow her Iulio, see her well attended; Sure she is Planet-struck, or some ill star Hath in her bosome wrought this mutinous war. Iul. Ile see well to her safety. Man. Oh my Dutchesse! Pro. These are but womens passions, And like a tempest, the more violent 'tis 'Twill be the sooner blown o'r. Man. So I hope. Pro. Feare not my Lord, perhaps she counterfeits To know how you affect her, if in this You will compassionate with her, and partake In this supposed frenzie. Man. 'Tis like so, For if a man may trust a sleeping woman, She loves me 'bove the world. Pro. My Lord I know it. Man. Nay, I know it too, Ile never else trust dreames. Pro. But leaving this, I have a sute unto your Grace. Man. Speake and prevaile deare friend. Pro. There is a Spanish Lady my first Love, Who hearing of my residence with you, Is travell'd thence to meet me in your Court, I have notice that she shortly will arive; My purpose is to feast her in my Lodging So lately built, next to your Daughters Tower, Where if it please you with these Lords to grace us, And taste a homely banquet, I shall say To you I am engaged every way. Man. I will not faile thee, nor shall these our friends, Wee'l grace the Spanish Lady with our presence. Clo. I have a sute to your Grace. Man. Thy business Groome? Clo. That for the good news I have brought you I may have some guerdon, some remuneration, as they say. Man. This thy reward be since by thy occasion My Dutchess of her best wits is depriv'd, Wander for ever like a banish'd Caine, Till of her sence she be possest againe Dare not so neare our Court. Come Lords, let's in To cheere her sorrows, and her fate lament, But to the man that can her frenzie cure We here proclaime what e're he can demand, If in the compasse of our populous Land. Ex. Clo. Banish, what's that? can any man tell me what it means? let me see; Banish'd sure is some strange language, and for any thing I know the meaning of it may be, give him a hundred Crowns, or give him two hundred Crowns; and banish'd the Court may be come to the Court and there you shall receive them; the Duke was not wont to give me such hard words; if he had call'd me Rogue or Rascall, I had understood him, I had had him to a haire, but the word banish'd doth a little stick in my stomack; Banish'd! I will go seek out some wise man or other to tell me what the the word meanes, and what sum of money I may demand of the Dukes Treasurer; Banish'dâ Enter Montecelso. Mon. Save you sir. Clo. And you my friend, what are you? Mon. Sir I professe my selfe to be a wise man. Clo. Then you are the man that I desire to meet, for I was seeking a wise man to tell me the meaning of a strange word. Mon. Unfold thy mind; I shall resolve thee truly Lye it within the power of humane skill. Clo. Thus Stands the case: The Duke entertain'd a fellow to looke to his buildings, and this fellow drown'd himselfe, it was my fate to bring the news to the Court, which when the young Dutchess heard, she grew presently as mad as a march Hare; now demanding reward for my news, the Duke out of his bounty said, he would banish me the Court; now I would faine know what sum of money the word banish'd signifies. Mon. It signifies, that if thou dar'st presume To come within the Court gate, thou incur'st The Dukes displeasure, it is present death. Clo. You will not buy my reward sir, will you? Mon. Not I. Clo. Then I see thou art a wise man. Mon. But is the Dutchess frantique? Clo. Ile assure you she's a mad wench. Mon. And how did the Duke take it? Clo. Oh very discontentedly: and he hath proclaim'd to him that can cure her of her frenzy to have the next thing he shall aske without exception. Mon. But art thou sure 'tis true? Clo. I assure you my friend as true as I am banish'd. Mon. That cure Ile undertake, and so prevaile, That I presume my cunning shall not faile. Clo. Now sir I have resolv'd you of all these doubts, can you tell me how I shall bestow my selfe now I am banish'd? Mon. I can, I am a stranger in this City, And I professe darke arts, Physick, and Negromancy, And for a need can conjure; but direct me Where I may lodge and freely use my Art, Ile entertaine thee and supply thy wants With all things needfull. Clo. As bountifull as wise; I am for you sir so you will teach me wit; I have seen the Duke and his Court, but never to my knowledge saw a wise-man afore, you are the first of the name that ever I look'd on; but if it be nothing but a Lodging you want, trust to me, I can furnish you with that at an houres warning. Mon. Direct me to the place. Clo. That I will sir as well as I can, Be you the wise Master, Ile be the wise man. Mon. Attend me then, her choice love I have found, I made the hurt, and I can cure the wound. Exeunt. Enter Mantua, Florence, Ferrara, and Iulio. Man. Her fits encrease then dayly. Iul. They still grow, Sometimes her eyes with salt teares over-flow; She fills the house with Musique, and then wrings Her Ivory hands, she dolefully laments, At once expressing thousand discontents. Man. Proclaime to him that can her frenzy cure The next thing he can aske. Iul. I shall my Lord. Flo. My Lord leave these discontents to some further leasure, we are now at the strange Knights Lodging to give entertainment to the Spanish Lady. Fer. True, we are his invited guests, and it is not fit that our grievances should any way appeare to a stranger. Man. You counsell well, behold this is his Lodgingâ And here's the Knight himselfe. Enter Prospero. Pro. Welcome my Lord to a poore strangers Lodging, My beautious Lady and my Love's arriv'd, Whose grace I first wonne in a Turnament, Bearing the prize from many Knights of Spaine; Please you to grace me at a solemne feast Which I prepar'd this day to welcome her, You shall do much honour. Man. Knight I will, And for thy sake respect her to her worth; How dost thou like thy Lodging built so neare This Castle where Valentia lies inclos'd? Pro. My Lord, 'tis well for prospect and for aire, Hoboys Wil't please you enter Lords, where be my servants. Ex. A Banquet. Enter Mantua, Florence, Ferrara, Iulio, Prospero. Man. Is this the place? Pro. It is my Lord; but I must crave your pardon, We want that order, and that entertainment, That observation and decorum now That 'longs to your estate and soveraignty, Yet our good thoughts above our power are large And full of zeale. Man. Come, th'art at too much charge. Pro. May it please your Highnesse to possesse your seat, Homely your Viands, but your welcome's great. Flo. But where's the Lady? She should be Mistris of the feast to dayâ Enter Valentia like a Spanish Lady. Fer. She is not far, see yonder where she comes. Man. My Daughter. Flo. 'Tis Valentia. Iul. Sure 'tis Valentia in this strange disguise. Or can you once againe deceive my eyes? Man. My Daughter on my life, her eye, her brow, Her every part; ha, are my eyes my own? Here hang my keyes, the doores fast barr'd and lock'd; Nor is she subtile spirit, compos'd aire, To creep though key-holes, or to crawle through chinkes; Tush, tush, one Lady may be like another, And my suspect is causelesse. Pro. Let me entreat you To take your seat, My Ladie's but a stranger, And unacquainted with th'Italian guise. Iul. Observe her well my Lords. Flo. She hath her blush. Fer. Her lip, her front. Iu. The right trick of her eye. Man. But is it she, is't possible the Knight Would be so bold, she so audacious? It cannot be; come, now I take my place. Pro. In this your Highnesse doth your servant grace. Val. Echa nos de beuer dios benediga toda la Compania seias &amp; bien venido. Man. What saies the Lady? Pro. She cals for wine and bids you welcome all. Man. The very touch and accent of her tongue. Val. Signeur yo beuo au de buen coracon. Man. Her meaning. Pro. She drinks to you with a good heart. Man. Tell her I pledge gladly. Iul. Doubtlesse 'tis she, can it be otherwise? Flo. Why spend we time in cups and banquets here, When faire Valentia must be needs transform'd Unto this stranger-Lady. Fer. Still the more That I observe her I am more confirm'd. Iul. 'Tis she, some devill or witch else. Man. When face, and tongue, and each thing proves her mine, Why should I doubt to challenge her? Ile suddenly Call on her name, and if she answer to't Dobtlesse 'tis she, Valentiaâno. Pro. What meanes your Lordship? Man. Nothing, nay nothing; see the very Ring Upon her finger, I can sit no longer; My Lords, I must entreat your patience, I have dropt a Jewell as I came along, And must find it or it will go wrong. Iul. A Jewell lost. Flo. Let's help his Grace to seek it. Pro. Pray do my Lords. Fer. Some Torches there. Pro. Lights for the Lords, 'twas dropt sure by the way, Help him to seeke it. Iul. Look well there in the Rushes. Exeunt. Pro. Haste through the private doore, off with that habit; If this passe currant we are past all feare, Your Father's gone in post, why do you stay? Val. I have the odds, for mine's the nearer way; Farewell sweet Prospero. Exit. Pro. Seek till your eyes be blind, You shall lose her though you the Jewell find; How Fortune smiles upon our cunning shifts, They are busie all at worke, the Duke himselfe Is like a Jaylor gingling of his keyes, Which serves her as a watch-word to uncase; If now our plot prove, there depends on this All our succeeding hopes, and future blisseâ Ent. Val, above. Valentia, Valentia. Val. Here my Lord. Pro. What, at your book already? Val. Yes sir, to pray After these tempests for a calmer day. Pro. The Duke's at hand, and seeking how to crosse Our loves hath all his Lords left at a losseâ Enter Man. Man. Body of me she's here; foole that I am Her loyalty to mistrust, or his good thoughts, She being chaste, he honest; how now Lady, What at your booke so close? Val. Books are Companions To them who are compell'd to single lives. Man. Thou art ranke 'mongst Virgins. Val. Virgins would be wivesâWhy come you sir? Man. Only my girle to see How well thou farest, thou one day shalt be free; Farewell, in this my jealousie appeares, And this one feare begets a thousand feares. Exit. Val. Not without cause, good Father, knew you all; But I must down the next way through the wall. Exit. Enter Prospero. Pro. By this she's comming, be thou first faire love, Or else our stratagem is quite o'rthrown, But if't take place, Valentia is mine own; How will the Duke look when he finds her here, And in his heart condemne his needlesse feare! He hath not wit to trace us in our drifts, True love is cunning and hath thousand shiftsâ Enter Val. Valentia. Val. Prince Prospero. Pro. And in your habit too, all succeeds happily. Val. Harke, harke, my Father is at hand my Lord, Ile keepe my place as if I had not mov'd, Who ever ventur'd fairer where they lov'dâ Enter Mantua. Pro. How now my Lord, what is the Jewell found? Man. 'Twas never lost, I left it in my Closset, Where it was safe, 'twas but my jealous feare And blind mistake, but now those doubts are past, For where I found it I have lock'd it fast. Pro. May it please your Grace to sitâ Enter Florence, Ferrara, Iulio. Flo. I have look'd my eyes almost blind, And yet I can no Jewell find. Fer. Sure if it had been a Diamond, or any stone that had had either lustre or quicknesse, I should have seen it sparkle. Pro. Lords, you may spare your paines, The Jewel's found. Man. Lords, seat your selves, and grace this strangers banquet, And speake what news is in the City rifest, For you frequent it most. Iul. They say, my Lord, there is a Negromancer, One of rare art and cunning, that can truly Tell of things lost, one that hath Ephemerides At his fingers ends; no frenzy, feaver, sickness, But he hath Cordials for, so his large bils, Pasted on every post, speak in his praise. Man. And where resides he? Iul. Here in the City Mantua. Flo. Some Mountebanke fellow. Iul. It should not seem so, For he hath much resort, and every month Proclaimes his skill. Pro. I will make triall of him, To know if my love-sute shall well succeed. Fer. Ile try his cunning. Flo. Ile be his Client. Iul. So will I, And in my deepe affaires his best skill try. Man. Ile prove him in the beautious Dutchess cure, In which if he prevaile his paines shall be Paid from the best of all his Treasury; We sit too long, stranger, we praise thy bounty, And if in any sute thou wilt use our love, Suppose it, crav'd, granted. Pro. I shall find time my Lord. Man. I cannot be at rest Till I have once more search'd her private Chamber to assure me Of these doubts; stranger farewell, Only my keyes can these sad doubts expell. Exit. Pro. Haste, haste to meet your Father in the Tower. Shortly will come the long expected houre. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. A Table with a Booke and Papers set out. Enter Montecelso and Clowne. Clo. You see I have purchas'd you a Lodging at the house of mine own flesh and bloud, otherwise call'd my Father; now sir, if you do not shew yourselfe a Master of your Art, or your Crafts-Master, you shall but disgrace your selfe, and call the reputation of my Fathers house in question. Mon. Tush, feare not me, what cannot I performe, A maske of naked wenches I could bring To dance strange Antiques here, and none but we To be spectatours. Clo. Oh brave man, when shall we see this sport? Mon. Dost thou love sweet meats? I have chang'd e're now, Against a Christning day, a showre of haile To perfect Comfets that have serv'd a feast, And I can do't againe, but tush 'tis nothing. Clo. Oh sweet men, here's one that by his Art is able to undo all the Comfet-makers in Christendome, Mon. What meat dost thou love best? Clo. I love many meates well, and indeed scarce any comes amiss, if it be come in his right likeness, when I have a stomack I can eate Capon and Rabit, but above all meats, not to dissemble, I love a good peece of roasted beefe. Mon. Ile tell thee what once I did in Germany, There was a hill lay just against the Sun, I by my art chang'd it to perfect beefe, Which the violent heat of the Sun roasted as Perfectly as any sea coale fire, and still as it Was enough the Country people came with their Sharpe knives and cut it off in slices. Clo. Oh that my journey had laine over that hill. Mon. Now sir a brooke ran by of cleare water, And that I turn'd to perfect vinegar For sauce to that rost-beefe, and the small sand Was chang'd to perfect pepper; now sir, it Was but bringing bread along with them and slicing away A peece of the hill, and sitting downe by the Rivers side, And there was as good rost beefe, vinegar, and pepper As any man in Mantua could desire to eate. Clo. This cunning man hath a trade would set any mans teeth a wat'ring that hath but a stomackâ Enter Prospero. But soft, here come strangers. Pro. If the wise man be as cunning as rumour reports him, Ile know what shall betide me in my love-affaires; This, I this, by my directions should be the house. Mon. My Cosin the Prince, excellent, Ile put him Into a pittifull perplexity e're we part. Pro. Now will I try whether this fellow have any cunning or no, thou learned man of Mantua heaven save thee. Mon. Thou worthy Gentleman of Verona, I thanke thee, Nay, I have given't you, pick out the meaning of that. Pro. He knows me to be of Verona. Mon. I, and an enemy to the Duke of Mantua. Pro. You wrong me sir, I love the Duke. Mon. I, and his Daughter too, pray do you not? Pro. A rare admirable fellow, he knows all, I must collogue with him, or hee'l reveale all my secrets to the Duke. Clo. Nay, herein, most learned, I must needs say you erre; and though I will not say your devill is a Lyer, because I am altogether unacquainted with him, yet in this I must needs tell you he is in the wrong, for this Gentleman is a true Trojan, a Knight Errant, and one that hath fought at the Tombe of adventures. Pro. Indeed I am a Stranger. Mon. Indeed you are a dissembler. Pro. My name's Antonio. Mon. Otherwise call'd Prince Prospero. Pro. The rarest fellow in Christendome; upon my life he knows my very thoughts my meditations. Mon. Come hither you, you that can gull the Duke, Make private doores into his Daughters Tower; And whil'st your Noble Father, good old man, Thinkes you abroad in travell to see fashions, You loyter here about a Ladies love. Pro. Oh wonderfull, I never heard the like! Mon. Now where's the Ring the Duke spi'd on your finger? When was the merry meeting with your friend And the two Ladies when they talk'd asleep, And by that sudden shift deceiv'd the Duke? Where's the strange Spanish Lady? where's the banquet To which you did invite him? Pro. He knows all, all by this light, There's nothing left unknown. Clo. Here's no roguery, here's no knavery, here's no villany, and all confest too, Ile even, like a good Subject, make all this acquainted to the Duke. Pro. Sweet Conjurer, good Mephastophilus, Ile give thee here a hundred Duckets straight But keep my counsell. Clo. But if the wise-man will, the foole will not; nay, and there be such knaveries in hand, you had better never have let them come to my eare, the Duke shall know all, all by this hand, nay, that's most certaineâtrust to it. Mon. Stay sirrah, or Ile bring you back with a whirlewind. Clo. Not I most learned, you shall pardon me; Ile be no Traytour for no mans pleasure. Mon. Prethee come back. Clo. No such matter, have you such fagaries, Ile tell the Duke. Mon. You doore maker. Clo. How most wise? Mon. The Duke shall know of making of that doore By which the Prince had free way to the Lady, You were his Overseer. Clo. No more, sweet Doctor Faustus, no more. Mon. Sirrah, you had better been a doore keeper than a doore-maker. Clo. Then I had better be a theefe than a knave, silence noble Scholler, and I am at thy service. Mon. Well sirrah, keep his Counsell and Ile keep yours, and whilest I speak a few words with this stranger, do thou watch there, and looke stedfastly at the kitchin window, for about dinner time there will flye in Capons, Pigeons, Pigs, Geese, Larks, Chickens all ready roasted, with every one a knife at his girdle to cut himselfe up, do but thou watch and bring me word when they come flying in and call me; wee' to dinner. Clo. Oh rare, ready roasted! I would I were a wise man too, as I shall never bee whilest I live; it is nothing but spreading a cloath, laying trenchers, setting a salt, providing of bread, and making platters and sauce ready, and your roast-meat will come as duly every one flying to his own dish and sauce, as Crows in the evening fly to their own nests; Ile get him to tile our house with Biskets, to pave the Kitchin with Custards, to make our Lome-walls of Ginger-bread, and turne our Cheese-trenchers into Wafer-cakes; Ile watch, but if I bring him word till I have fill'd my belly, may my girdle break. Pro. Montecelso turn'd a wise man! Mon. I know that's more than ever thou didst looke for at my hands. Pro. Beshrew thee Coz, thou hast put me into two pittifull plunges, first thy death, next for this needlesse feare. Clo. Not yet! Pro. I thought as surely thou hadst been in heaven As I know this is earth: introth mad Coz, And hast thou gone beyond me? Clo. Now I hope: no, that was a Crow that flew over our house. Mon. Be confident for I have cast a plot How thou shalt steale away thy Love to Church, And make her Father with his own free hand Give her to thee in marriage; more than this, Put strange disgraces on thy opposites And such as are thy rivals; wouldst thou thinke Me a perfect wise man to contrive this well? Pro. More wise than I first knew thee. Mon. For this time part, earely to morrow morning Convey Valentia through the private doore Suted as at the Banquet; next invite The Mantuan Duke to grace your Nuptials In Saint Laureita's Chappell; what remaines Shall all be mine. Pro. My dearest friend adieu, No cunning head had e're a heart so true. Exit.âKnock. Mon. Harke, some one knocks. Clo. Most prudent. Mon. Leave staring to the kitch. till anon, And let me in these Gallants. Clo. Beshrew their hearts for me, belike they heard what good cheere was flying towards our house, and now like bold guests they are come to bid themselves to dinner; I will let them in, though I could wish them choak'd for their painesâ Enter Verona, Florence, Iulio, Ferrara. Ver. Who takes his turne first? Flo. That will I so please you. Mon. I know them all, their businesse, their affaires, And I shall fit them finely; grave old man, My choicest welcome I bestow on you, And welcome Lords to all, but first you; I know my Lord of Florence you affect The amorous Lady faire Valentia. Flo. Oh marvelous! Mon. But you the frantique Dutchess. Fer. Possible. Mon. Come, come, I know the inmost of your thoughts, Then to be briefe and cut off circumstance, Harke you my Lord of Florence, do but this, And Ile assure you faire Valentia's love, To morrow morning must the stranger Knight In Saint Lauretta's Chappell wed his Love, The Spanish Lady, given him by the Duke, Whil'st they are busied watch the new-built Tower, In which by Art I will contrive a doore, Which you shall find wide open. Flo. Oh rare man! Man. Through which passe freely; now to blind suspicion, Because you may not be descried or known, Weare some disguise, this paper shall direct you. Flo. Thou most ingenious Artist, take this Gold, The happy earnest of my future love. Exit. Mon. Enough my Lord, now waite upon my skill; And now to you, I know you love the Dutchess, But she is chang'd by sicknesse; yet my Lord If you will marry faire Valentia, Who for your love disdaines the Florentine, Ile set you down a course to compasse it. Fer. Either will serve my turne, I'm not so curious To tye my fancy to one womans face. Mon. Know, through my spirits help, I have digg'd a doore Quite through the Turrets doore, which wall leads streight Unto the Ladies Chamber, take this note, This Paper shall direct you. Fer. There's Gold for Paper. Mon. Adieu. Iul. My turne is next; I am a stranger to thee, learned Friend, Nor dost thou know my business. Mon. No Lord Julio. Iul. Iulio I'm call'd indeed. Mon. And love that Lady Whom these two Princes tenderly affect. Iul. Th'art something neare me. Mon. Ile come nearer yet, To the two strangers I could tell your hate, Th'one drown'd, t'other Guardian of the Tower, But my Art's no accuser. Iul. Noble Schollar, Let this Gold bribe thy art to secresie, And teach me how I may prevent their plots, Gaine the Dukes Grace, and faire Valentia's love. Mon. This Paper shall do all, peruse it then, And let it be your Tutor, so now leave me. Iul. With all my art Ile prove thy magick skill, And to the utmost what thou plot'st fulfill. Exit. Mon. Adieu; you sirrah. Clo. Most judicious. Mon. Follow them with speed, Watch them, and when thou seest them neare the Tower, Run to the Duke, and call his armed Guard To apprehend these Miners that have digg'd Unlawfull passage through his high-built Tower, See them well beaten, and after come to me, And I will teach thee this rare Negromancy. Clo. Feare not, Master Doctor, first Ile play my part, And after come to you to learne your Art. Exit. Mon. Now sir to you. Ver. And what to me sir? thinke not with your tricks To draw me in opinion you are wise. Mon. Were not your Grace a man I reverence. Ver. My Grace, what Grace? you'd gull me would you not? Mon. Nor can you gull me most excellent Lord, You are Verona's Duke; nay, never start, For to your eare my tongue's close as your heart; I know that Mantua loves you not, yet know Your Son serves Mantua as a friendly Foe. Ver. Pardon me sir, I now approve your cunning, Conceale my being, and expect rewardâ But see the Duke. Enter Mantua, Dutchesse and Servant. Man. What liberall reprover, I perceive You find some matter in this man of note. Ver. Matter indeed my Lord, this is a man Exceeding many other private men, That are indeed but shaddows, counterfeits, This man hath naturall gifts joyn'd with his Art. Man. We like your praise, and will our selfe applaud His excellence, if by his grounded skill He can give ease to this faire Dutchess griefe. Mon. What Mortalls can attempt Ile undertake; This is the Lady, and I know her griefe Arises from a sullen melancholly; She has lost some friend, the sorrow of whose death Hath turn'd her sanguine streames of bloud to black. Dutch. Black, lost, gone, sunke, fled, adieu, farewell, The waves have quite undone poore Lucibell. Mon. Tush, I can cure this madnesse presently. Man. How learned Friend? restore her to her senses, And the next thing that thou demand'st is thine. Mon. I know the perfect temper of her griefe. Which that you may perceive Ile cure with Art; I will raise up the Ghost of him she lov'd, So like in all things you your selves shall sweare It is the man. Man. Shall he appeare to us? Mon. Here to you all, but stir not, move no foot, Take heed you do not question him too far, But only heare and see, and stand aloofe. Man. But will he not afright us? Mon. Not a jot; Looke to the Lady, Ile about my Art, And send the Architector presently. Exit. Dutch. Well, if I see him I will chide him so, That he shall never drowne himselfe againe. Man. Is't possible this can be done by Art? Or meanes he to delude us? Dutch. So it seemes, for I shall ne'r more see my Love again. Man. Sweet Lady be content. Dutch. You see I am. The sound may give whole counsel to the sick, Away, your counsell does encrease my paine, And I shall ne'r more see my Love againeâ Enter Montecelso as a Ghost. Ver. He's come already. Man. Lord how like he is! Would you not sweare it were the very man; An admirable Artist! see he wafts the Lady. Dutch. Oh thou deare soule of my sweet Love deceas'd, Ile follow thee. Man. Stir not, it is the Devill. Dutch. Spirit or fiend, his amorous shape so charmes, Did he graspe hell I'd flie into his armes. Exeunt. Man. The Devill hath born her hence, follow and rescue her. Ver. Not I my Lord, your Grace shall pardon me. Man. Oh what black trespasse hath she done 'gainst heaven That she should thus be hurried quick to hell; Now is she hopelesse, past recovery; Ile hang that Conjures. Ver. Condemn him not before you see the event. Man. What can the event be but her utter losse? Oh my faire Dutchess, if thou perish thus, Ile make that base Inchanter curse this day, For thy lost bloud his traiterous head shall payâ Enter Montecelso. Mon. How cheeres my Lord, did you behold the Ghost? Man. We saw the Devill, but speake, where's the Dutchess? Mon. Safe in my Chamber, where before to morrow. Your Grace shall see her perfectly recover'd, Doubt not my Art; but there remaines, my Lord, For you a further business, the strange Knight Expects the Spanish Lady from your hand In Saint Lauretta's Chappell, whither I promise To bring your Lady perfectly recover'd. Man. See this done, And the next thing that thou demand'st is thine. Mon. I shall make bold, my Lord, to claime your promise. Man. Claime it and take it. Mon. You'll trust her in my Chamber for this night, For I must physick her. Man. Do what thou pleasest, it highly shall content me; Come, let's returne to Court, and there attend Of our precedent feares a fortunate end. Exeunt. Mon. Thou hast no part in that faire fortunate end, It 'longs to me, and to my noble friend: Madamâ Enter Dutchesse. Dutch. Oh my deare Love how could you so delude A Lady that with such intire affection And zealous love admir'd and honour'd you! Mon. Of that no more; the Duke for this great cure Hath promis'd me what I shall next demand, I have a boone to aske, I have set on foot Many strange plots which must their full effect Receive this night, the Prince is to espouse The faire Valentia by the Dukes free gift, Florence, Ferrara, and Lord Iulio, His Rivals, are about their severall tasks; Something there remaines for me, amongst the rest, And you to act out of these confusions, We must devise our fortunes to secure, And save that love that is so chaste and pure. Exeunt. Hoboys. A dumbe shew. Enter at one Doore a Bishop, Mantua, and Verona, fetch Prospero and Valentia, Mantua makes some strange pauses, viewing the Lady exactly, at length (recalling his hand once or twice) troath-plights them, and so march over to the Church. Enter Iulio like a Smith. Iul. In this disguise who can know Iulio now, Or guesse the purpose that I have in hand? This Paper tells me I shall find a doore Left open to Valentia's amorous bed: here Ile waite The happy end of my auspicious Fateâ Enter Florence as a Mason. Flo. So I am fitted so unwillingly That I scarce know my selfe; yet as this Paper Gives me directions may I find the Doore Left open to me, I desire no moreâ Enter Ferrara as a Carpenter. Fer. A Carpenter I should be, would this Apron And Rule bring me to rule in Mantua By marriage of the faire Valentia, I should applaud my fortunes, and commend The wise mans Art; this can imperious love, Ent. Clo. and Guard. Whose power hath oft transhap'd the gods above. Clo. You shall be transhap'd Ile warrant you, wee'l teach you to take upon you other mens trades before you be free of their Companies; if your Rule at your back will not rule you, we will; stand close Gentlemen, and though we find them broad awake, let's see if we can take them napping. Iul. The doore, according to to the wise-mans words, I find wide open, Ile enter. Fer. Why pause I being so neare? Flo. Ile enter instantly, but soft, I am prevented. Iul. Company, now must I counterfeit to worke. Fer. To shun discovery, Ile see how I can play the Carpenter. Flo. Now to my Masonry. Iul. Would I were ten Leagues off. Clo. Upon them Gentlemen, upon them, these be the underminers I told you of, up with your Poleaxes and down with them, see they have broken open a doore already, they shall be arraigned of Burglary. Iul. Hold, hold, and heare us. Clo. Bumbaste them Gentlemen, currifeige them bravely, heare them after; palt the Mason with stones, hammer the Smith, &amp; over-rule the Carpenter, come, away with 'em. Exeunt. Enter Verona. Ver. My Son is married to the Mantuan Princesse, A Lady of that presence and opinion, That it offends me not; but to prevent Any offence that may be done to him, Or injury to me, I have at hand A Royall Army under Cosmos charge, Our trusty and approved Counsellor, To offer War or Peaceâthe Duke's at hand. Exit. Florish. Enter Mantua, Prospero, and Valentia. Man. How naked is our Traine, that of our Courtiers, So few attend this high solemnity? Where's Florence? where's Ferrara? where's Lord Iulio? That have not seen us given away this Daughter I feare, for so my eye perswades; Had I not in these keyes such confidence, And in the strength of my large edifice, I should not doubt to sweare, but these Ile trust, When servants faile, keyes and stone-walls prove just. Pro. Thrice worthy sir, you have given me such a gift, Should you impart you Dukedomes large revenew It could not equal't; now your hand is past, Which both your word and Church-rights have made fast. Man. 'Twere best that I returne to see all safe, And next enquire how my faire Dutchesse fares. Pro. Feare not my Lord, you have committed her To his protection that undoubtedly Will see to her recovery. Man. So we hope. Pro. Restore her to her senses and true feeling. Man. We doubt it not. Pro. And apt her thoughts for love. Man. That's all we covet. Pro. I have understood By those that know him, so much hee'l make good. Man. Then are we truly happyâ Enter Clowne, Iulio, Florence, Ferrara. Clo. Roome for one good Subject that brings three bad Subjects to answer Burglary before your Grace: see here my Lord, here are three fellows that have good faces and are asham'd to shew 'em, they seeme to be sound men, yet see if they do not strive to looke scurvily? Man. What men are these? or how have they offended? Why do they turne their heads thus and looke downwards? Clo. As if they had stolne a pudding. Pro. These faces I should know, my Lord of Florence, Ferrara's Marquesse, and Lord Iulio; Is this the cost you have so liberally Bestow'd to grace our feast? my Bride and I Are much bound to you. Man. These the men, perhaps they have some maske, If so, let's see't. Flo. Compell me not to answer. Fer. Give me leave To blush and be asham'd. Iul. Hell take the Conjurer. Man. My Lords, what meanes this antique? if you have Some sport to shew us, pray my Lords let's have't. Iul. So, so. Pro. How well this sute becomes you! troth my Lord, Might I advise you, I would still go thus; Acquaint me with your Taylor. Man. Is this the newest fashion? Iul. Would I were in the Indies Rather than here. Man. But tell me sirrah, what meanes this shew? Clo. Call you these Lords! no, they are Loones, they looke more like Prentices than Princes; these are they that have beleaguered your new Tower, and digg'd a hole through the wall, that an Oxe or an Asse, blesse us, as big as your selfe may creepe through; there's a doore made into your Daughters Tower where she was kept, and the doore being left open she is flowne away: Valentia is gone, she is gone, and these are they that had their hands in the businesse. Man. Valentia gone, and by their practice lost! Clo. By theirs; when they were boring at the hole we took them at it with their tooles out, we tooke them in the manner before they could put up, and here we have brought them to answer before your Grace, that you may freely punish their weaknesse that would offer to go to your walls. Man. These injuries severely wee'l revenge, But most on thee false Iulio, for her losse Thy head shall pay. Iul. Pox of the Conjurer I say still. Man. Speake, where's Valentia, can you tell me? All. No. Man. Then for her losse your forfeit lives shall go; Who can advise me best where I may find Her I most lov'd, and hath prov'd most unkind. Clo. Might I advise your Grace, I would have you should do as Archers do, that when they have lost an Arrow, shoot another after it; so, my Lord, if you have ever another Lady or Mistris about the Court, shoot her after your Daughter, that you may either find one, or lose both. Pro. Good Counsell. Man. To him that can reduce her to her Tower, Or put me in possession of her hand, What grace our Power or Dukedome can command Shall all be his. Pro. I take you at your word, see here my Lord. Man. This, this is the Spanish Lady. Val. She that spoke In Spanish once is forc'd to change her tongue, Pardon deare Father. Man. Ha! am I then o're-reach'd? is't possible For all my Cost, Charge, Care, and diligence A Wenches wit out-go me? could her subtiltie Make way through that which not an Army could? What should I say? Clo. Those Creatures that weare smocks Will where they love pierce stone-wals, creep through locks; Why thus you see, as well as we, a great man may be gull'd, Woodcocks are meat, but not to eat untill that they be pull'd. Ex. Iul. That private doore, my Lord, I now perceive Was made by him. Flo. My Lord, remember you The Ring you spied upon his finger once, Then thinke upon the doore. Fer. You made us tosse the rushes And seeke the Jewell, did you? Speake, what art thou That thus hast gull'd the Duke? Pro. I am a Prince, And every way thy equall. Man. I would to heaven it were no worse. Val. He is no lesse my Lord, receive him then to grace. Man. Of Whence? Pro. Verona. Man. Mine enemy. Pro. Was't not a friendly part To lodge your only child so neare my heart? Val. My Lord, remember he once sav'd your life, And even for that deserves me for his wife. Pro. Now as a friend a friendly League I crave, Take not away what you so freely gave. Man. I will pause upon't, although it be past help, And see what we may punish, what forgive; But now my only comfort is stor'd up In the faire Dutchesse, if she gaine her healthâ Ent. Dutch. and Mont. And here she comes, I cannot choose but feare So long as I behold yon Ghost so neare. Fer. That Conjurer Is a rare Artist that can raise a shadow So like unto the Substance. Man. Faire Dutchesse, art thou recover'd, speake? Dutch. Thanke heaven I am. Man. 'Tis well done to have heaven still in thy thoughts Being so neare a feind, come from that Devill. Dutch. Feare not my Lord, I am so arm'd with faith, And love withall, he hath no power to hurt me. Man. Art thou well? Dutch. Yes my Lord, I am well. Man. Come from him, but art thou very well? Dutch. Very well my Lord I thanke you. Man. Perfectly well? Dutch. So well you cannot wish me better. Man. Come hither then. Dutch. I was of late but ill, Then give me leave, my Lord, to keep my selfe Well while I am well. Mon. That's with me my Lord. Man. Can the Ghost speake too. Mon. Speake, and talke, and walke, Embrace and kisse. Man. I love no kissing Ghosts. Flo. Beleeve me, that Magician was a man Of rare experience, and deserves great praise. Fer. Did he not say before what he should do, That Ghost doth act his part exceedingly. Man. I say come from him, he's a spirit. Dutch. I do not love to do any thing but with a spirit. Man. He came out of hot hell. Dutch. Hee'l make the warmer bedfellow. Mon. Further than you have been, be not deceiv'd my Lord. Man. That's far enough already. Mon. I am the man I seem, no Architector, But Cosin to that noble Gentleman Prince Prospero, of the Duke Verona's Court, That for this Dutchesse love have thrust my selfe Into this imminent danger, as the Prince Hath done the like for his Valentia; You promis'd me, if I could cure this Lady, The next thing I demanded, her I crave, Whom if I truly merit let me have. Man. I have been gull'd on all sides, nor will I Put up these injurious wrongs, you both shall dyeâ Ent. Iul. Iul. To arms, to arms my Lord, for I descry A potent Army marching before our walls, And by their Colours flying they should be of Verona. Man. Be they from whence they will wee'l parley them; Admit their Generall to an interview Florish. To know their cause of Armsâ Enter Verona. Our Cinick turn'd a Souldier! Pro. Noble Father I crave your pardon. Mon. I the like my Lord. Ver. Stand on our party then whil'st I debate Our purpose with this Duke; these Armes we levied With no intent of wrong to Mantua, But to secure our Son, and this his friend, We do protest it is no worke of ours That he is married, neither did we wish't; But since by heaven and fate they are united, We rather wish they may their Loves enjoy, Than what heaven seems to applaud we should destroy. Man. To plead in Armes is best way to prevaile, Where still the weak'st must yield; since our own bloud Hath had an equall share in this our wrong, Why should we envy strangers, we will strive From the worlds eye to hide this ominous scarre; Heaven offers peace, why should we threaten war? Each where they love joyne hands. Pro. Our hearts. Val. A sweet Conclusion. Mon. And now Madam Ile make you amends for mocking you. Dutch. Great men are sometimes gull'd, but that's not common, You have done more, for you have gull'd a woman. Man. Your Son, Verona, and his friend hath much Outstrip'd us by their wit, but the best is We are not gull'd alone, You see your greatnesse is no priviledge From those that have quick braines, but now all friends; Verona we embrace, and thus attone All our dissentions; Marriage shall conclude What Armes hath menac'd; our united Dukedomes Since by this happy fate they are agreed, Wee'l strive which most in bounty shall exceed.
