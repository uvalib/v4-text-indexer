      <field name="fulltext">Here beginneth the worthy Enterlude of Kynge Daryus. Neuer before Imprynted. The Prolocutor. Good people harke &amp; geue eare a whyle, For of thys Enterlude I wyll declare the style, As Auctours heretofore haue thought it commodyous The whole some of theyr matter before to dyscusse So hath our Auctour thought it nesessary By a Preface to declare thys Commody To tell the matter I will now begyn A certayne kynge (to you) we shall brynge in Whose name was Daryus (good and vertuous) Of nature also both louyng and courtuous Thys kynge commaunded a feast to be made And at that banket many people had These fyrst will I reherce, Percia and Medya, And then Iuda, and also Ethyopia, These came to the kynges banket And tooke such parte as before them was set, With a glad mynde to that they were consented And after to theyr owne roofes returned. And when the kynge in counsayle was set Two Lordes c?maunded he to be fet As consernyng matters of three yonge men Whych breyfely shewed theyr fantasie then, In wrytyngs theyr menyngs they dyd declare And to gyue them to the kynge they dyd not spare One wryt one thynge, nexte the other, But the thyrd the trueth aboue all other. You shall here anone how he is rewarded And also for hys trueth well contented As for the other it goeth ill wyth them Because they dyssembled lyke wycked men. Now the preface to you I haue declared And of it also the effecte ye haue harde Now sylence I desyre you therfore For the Uyce is entrynge at the dore. The Prologue goeth out, &amp; Iniquity c?meth in. Iniquytie. How now my maisters, how goeth the world now I came gladly to talke with you But softe, is there no body here Truly I do not lyke thys gere, I thought I shuld haue found sum bodie Let me looke better yet I pray ye, I am mad now to the sole of my foote And they were here I wold lay them on the coote A horson knaues haue you thus mee mocked Suerly I will breake theyr hed, Come no neare it were for you best If you do, it shall not be for your rest. Here entreth Charytie. Charytye. Holde thy hand I pray thee hartelie, Of Charytie be content I pray thee. Iniquytie. Thou wilt not fyght I dare saye Gyt thee awaye or I wyll thee slay, Ha thou knaue, who made thee so bolde? Thou lokest lyke an auncyant father and a olde Who made thee come into my domynion? Tell mee one thynge, how doth thy mynion? I thynke surely it is a trym wenche and a feayre How sayest thou, how lykest thou thys geare? Charytie. Thy c?munycatyon I lyke not trulye Nor at all I set not by thy flatterye It is very follie that thou doest saye Men to trust in theyr mad fancies alwaye As for me I trust god hath geuen me the grace All my ennemies clerely to deface. Iniquytie. What art thou called? thy name tell to mee. Charytie My name (I tell thee) is Charitie Without the which no flesh can Iustyfied bee. Iniquytie. Yea, truly thou art an holy man As is betweene this and Buckingham, I pray thee tel me what meneth this word charity? Because thou doest make it so holy. Charytie. Peace man thou arte vnwyse, Neuer a good thought canste thou deuyse, For if thou couldest thus thou woldest not prate. Iniquytie. Gyt thee away for thou shalt not be my mate I wyll haue a better fellow then thou arte Or by you all I wyll not set a farte. Charytie. God hath c?maunded one to loue another Thy very ennemy as thy owne brother, It is euen gods c?maundement To loue our fooes with a good intent. And who so dooth loue God aboue With vnfayned and pure loue And hys neyghbour as hym selfe also Hym wyll god prosper in wealth and wo For the Prophets requyre of vs no more, But that a faruent loue wee keepe in stoore. Iniquytie. That I shall, I wyll kepe it faste. Charytie. What wilt thou keepe tell mee in haste? For I thynke thou art a deceytfull person. Iniquytie. You bad I shuld kepe my money leaste it were gone And I made my pursse so close &amp; so hard That it will not be lost .iii. halfpence I will ieobard No, no, it will not come out agayne. Charytie. O false Iniquytie I tell thee playne That God will thee surely destroye, Without other fauour or mercye Easyer will it be I do tell thee For a Gable rope to enter into a Nedles eye Then for an vnrighteous &amp; wycked m? I tel the To enter into heauen at any tyme verelye, Therfore thy folly do not vpholde But it to leaue be thou bolde. Iniquytie. Be bolde it were not best for thee To make any pratinge here at mee, Therfore gyt thee quyckly awaye, Or wyth my dagger I will thee sleaye. Charytie. Thy wordes ar nought and very foolyshe I do not at all regarde them doubtlesse, Ah wycked ennemy thou speakest lyke a foole. Iniquytie. Syrs who is there that hath a stoole? I will buy it for thys Gentleman If you will take money come as fast as you can. Charytie. I do not lyke verely thy companie It were best for me to go from thee Thys loue that wee haue ought to be so puer On Iustyce grounded, and on fayth suer, But the loue that in thee doth appere Is not worthe the valour of a heare Semeth it neuer so much worthy prayse In mens syght, yet it is to our owne decayes It is abhomynable before god trulye And at all of hym not estemed I tell thee. Iniquytie. By my trouthe here is a good sporte That thou hast made of me such a reporte Thou horson knaue get thee awaye Or I will deceyue thee with my subtyltie I saye, If thou go not hence to thee it will be deathe For in mee is neyther trust nor faythe. Charytie. I thinke thou doest thinke as thou doest say For by thy workes it doth appere alway That thou doest neuer god regarde Thy nature appereth to be so harde O wycked feend and full of ill With myscheife and flatery thou doest mee fyll Saynct Paule to the Romaynes doth declare To tell the sentence I wyll not spare, Quis quiete siue charitate viuere potest. In fewe wordes it is exprest, If out of theyr place hyls I cold moue I were nothing if I had no loue. If to fede the poore, also my goods I did bestow Had I no Charytie I were not worth a strawe. By loue are wee knowen to bee, The chyldren of Chryst in hys dyetye, Therfore thou Iniquitie gyt thee hence. Iniquytie. Nay fyrst will I thee recompence It were best for the hence to be gone Or suerly I will make thee grone. Charytie. Sainct Iames also in his Epystle hath thys who is a freind of the world, the ?nemy of god is Saincte Paule also to the Romayns dclareth That he that is without loue and fayth Can neuer come to the kyngdome of God. Iniquytie. Nay then I sweare by this Roode It were not best for thee to tary For if thou do I wyll slaye thee truly. Charytie. Thys thy pratynge shall not make mee cease It were best for thee to holde thy peace, And obaye that whych I haue sayde: And from these preceptes do not slyde By these vayne gaudes do not set For no profyte of them at all shalt thou get Iniquytie. What hast thou to do with yt thou old knaue Gyt thee awaye betimes or no grace thou shalte haue. Charytie. O dyssemblyng and flatteryng generation God will you destroye, (o wycked nacyon) In mouth you professe gods holy name But in your thoughtes you sure abuse the same: Well, because thou art an vngodly person I wil from thee away be gone. And goeth out. Iniquitie. Ha, ha, ha, is it euen so, By my trouth syr I am as glad as you For at no rest at all could I bee Whylst thou wast here wyth mee Farewell Peter blowbowle I may wel call thee, I maruell who they be I see commyng here By the mouse foote I charge you to appere Nay then I must neades make me readye Or wyth me it wyll be wronge trulye, Here Importunytie &amp; Parcyalytie enter. Wh? one blow c?meth on this side, another on yt But I trow I c? fere the knaues wt my gr?nams Cat Pusse pusse, where art thou? come away. Importunytie. Peace man, be of good cheare I say, Thynkest thou wee with thee will fyght No that we will not I sweare by this lyght. Parcyalytie. Why dyd he thynke we wolde do so? No man we wyll not I warrand you But who was it that was here of late. Iniquytie And wilt thou nedes know, it was such a mate As I could not fynde betwene thys and hell It is no lye that I thee tell, Hee dyd here so on me rayle But I thynke I gaue hym a blowe with a Foxe tayle So he was gone quycly from mee He durst tarye no longer in my companie. Importunytie. Thou didest serue him well I sweare by thys bread Thou shuldst haue payd hym about the head I wold I had hym here for hys sake I wolde haue made hym chanels to rake. Parcyalytie. What was hys name? I pray thee tell mee. Iniquytie. Hys name was mayster Charytie. Parcyalytie. If I had bene here I tell thee iwysse I wold surely haue made hym to pysse I harde say he was such a clarke which wold haue made my conscience very darke But tell mee, how didst thou dryue hym awaye. Iniquytie. Yes yes, I dyd well ynoughe I made the knaue git his lyuyng by the ploughe Where he had one word, I had halfe a score Yea, and there had byn a few more, Wyth the knaue had I thys c?munycatyon That at last I made a proclamatyon That if any were found within my cure Whych to Iniquytie and falshod wold not aluer The same shuld dye wythout any remedy The knaue hard that and got him away quickly Thus dyd I handle the knaue That no mercy at all of mee could he haue. Importunytie. Mary and thou dydst serue hym well Where is he now I pray thee canst thou tell. Iniquytie. I thynke he be gone now to hell I care not where he be, so he come no more here How saiest thou knaue, how likest thou this gere Parcyalytie. By my trouth thys gere doth me well please. When thou hast hym let hym be at no ease. Iniquytie. I will rappe hym thus vpon the bones And will make hym very soore grone But I pray thee tell mee? what is thy name. Importunytie. Importunytie is the very same Nues I do bryng hether for aduantage And to tel lyes for lucre is my common vsage. Parcyalytie. Yea, I warrand thee hee is such a felow As is not hence to Peterborow. Iniquytie. Tell thy name I pray thee vnto me Parcyalytie. Syr my name is Parcyalytie To handle the knaue I wylbe bolde, I wil make that his hart shalbe soone very cold. Iniquytie. Of trueth you two are such honest men As is not betwyxt thys and hell then, But I pray thee what newes canste thou tell me Will he come againe or no I pray thee. Importunytie. Nay that he wyll not I dare saye For if he do he were better naye. Parcyalytie. What nedest thou care so longe as I am here I wyll hym handle do thou not fere, Blowes to geue hym I wyll not spare He is lyke if he come full ill to fare. Iniquytie. What nede I care as long as I haue such serua?tes To defend me from the crueltie of that Tyrante I warrant you my men dylygent be That pyseburnd knaue for to destroye. Parcyalytie, Yea I warrand thee do thou not feare We will hym so handle he shall not steare We will hym in our snares trappe And hym wyth a Foxtayle wee wyll flappe. Importunytie. Yea and I also wyll do my parte And wyll surely put hym to smarte, I warrand thee I will vexe hym full sore That he shall prate here no more. Iniquytie. Yea by god and well sayde, I con you thanke And he be thus h?dled with him it wilbe blanke Ha, ha, ha, ha, surely I must nedes smyle To see how these the knaue wyll defyle You are two as dronken knaues As are betwene this &amp; your owne skyns, so God me saue. Parcyalytie. Why Iniquytie, what doest thou saye? Iniquytie. I sayd ye were two honest men by my faye, But surely I dyd not so thynke No that I dyd not I sweare by thys drynke Importunytie. Now thou art dysposed to ieste Well Iniquytie I thynke it best, To be gone out of thy companye For here thou doest with vs but dalie. Parcyalytie. I warrand thee man it is not so Is it Iniquytie how say you. Iniquytie. Thou pratyng foole holde thy peace Or to laye thee on the coate I wyll not cease I thynke thou knowest not to whom thou doest speke I faith you knaue I wil make you a peke A you horson I will rappe you on the scull. Importunytie. Nay be content I pray thee. Iniquytie. Nay that I will not verelye. Parcyalytie. I pray thee freind hold thy hande Thou foole canest thou not styll stande. Iniquytie. But syrs I pray you who is hee That entreth hereby. Equytie entreth. Parcyalytie. Truly I do see the same Enquyre (I pray thee) what is hys name. Importunytie. What is thy name freynd tell mee.

Whoo, haue we more blesseds come to ye towne Thou mayst go meddle of clouting thy gowne With vs thou hast nothyng to do. Importunytie. No he hath nothyng to lay vs vnto Therfore he were best to holde hys peace, Equytie.

Yes, yes, god that sytteth aboue Doth marke them all as it doth hym behoue He but with one twinklynge of an eye Can spye th? out if they were .x. times more then they be Repent therfore your faultes betime And mercy alway of god clayme Then he will preserue you lyke his owne childr? And saue you from the lake that burneth wt brimstone. Iniquytie. Ha, ha, thys fellow is to good for mee One word agayne him I dare not speke trulye He hath so many wordes in store Farewell, farewell, I haue neuer a one more. Parcyalytie.

Leaue thy swearynge Thy mockyng thy tauntynge And all thy other game, God hath preparde For those a rewarde That do blaspheame hys mame. The Prophet Zachary Dyd see (I tell thee) A booke in the ayre, Twenty Cubyts length Ten cubyts bredth Being for them prepared That falsly do Sweare his neighbour vnto And doth not god regarde. Mathew also doth say Cursed be they alway That swere by any thynge, By hell or heauen ywysse Because in the powre it is Of that heauenly kynge. At all thou shalt not sweare By thy head nor yet thy eare But of god stnad in feare. Equytie. You do hym well instructe To god hym to conducte But all is in vayne, Hys bryttle nature And his auncyent stature Doth styll in hym remayne. Charytie. Such a froward fellow I do assure you I dyd neuer seee, Therfore I pray thee Without any remedy To God for mercy flee. Iniquytie. Hence you horson knaues I wold you were in your graues Then shuld I be at reste, To gyt mee away Without any delay I holde it best. Farewell by my trouth I must go to the south To seeke my fortune, Farewell agayne I say I must go my way My mother is within. Constancy. Nay softe I pray thee Away thou shalt not flee Tyll I haue tolde thee more, Geue eare a whyle And harken to the style That I dyd show before. Iniquytie. I will not tarry Farewell gentle Hary I c?myt thee to god. Charytie. Nay yet softe Away thou shalt not haste Tyll thou haue a sharper rod. Equytie. Wylt thou not regard The Lord nor hys reward Nor hym obay at all, For thy wyckednes And vngracyousnes Thou shalt haue a fall. Iniquytie. Nay that I will not for fourty pence I had rather then my new nothyng I were gon hence We shall haue neuer a bone setter I suppose If that I fall and breake my nose, I will kepe that ioynt while I haue it Or els (by my trouth) I may go turne the spyt. Constancye. Thou foolysh fellowe wilte thou not yet obaye God the Lorde, and on hym staye As my brethren before here haue declared That there is a vengeaunce for thee prepared For thy wyckednes And deceytfulnes Hell fyre is thyne. Iniquytie. Nay it is not myne It is in the deuyls gouernment Wythout my admonyshment I do not c?ma?d him what he hath to do Constancye. Yet wilt thou not leaue Poore men to deceyue And spoyle Chrystes flocke, Here thou doest them pull And make them so dull As euer was a blocke. Leaue thy follye Thou cruell ennemie And flee from thy vyce, Flee to god And his iust rod And leaue thy enterpryce. God turne thy mynde And saue thee from the feind, Because thou wilt not amend Thou shalt go hence For thy offence Thy follye to lamente. Iniquytie. Nay then I wil geue you no bread and butter Here take some it will make thee to scutter I will call my mother, let mee alone Of trouth she wyll make thee to grone Shee is such a pestilent woman As is not hence to our Lady of Basan, Shee will make thee repent that thou doest say and make the for fere take thy heles &amp; run away Take heede how thou comest in her hande If thou do thou shalt neuer come out of her b?d. Constancye. Go gyt thee awaye and make no more a do For if you wyll not, I will compell you. Charytie. You do well, Gods blessynge on youre harte, We wyll surely put hym to smarte. Equytie. That is ryght and iuste for to do In the whych dede I consent to you. Here sombody must cast fyre to Iniquytie. Constancye. For thy wyckednes thou shalte haue thys, As thou hast deserued for thy doinges ywysse Gyt thee away and tary not here. Iniquytie. Nay I go to the deuil I fere. &amp; goeth out. Constancie. Praysed be god That wyth hys rod Whych is vpryght, Hath thys man dystroyed And clene abhorred In his malyce and spyte. Equytie. My harte is as glad As though riches I had That Myda did possesse, Both corne and fruyte Nothing destytute Of aboundant excesse. Charytie. Prayse we god aboue With feare and loue Which hath plucked him away Let vs I praye you Prayse hym and magnyfy For euer and aye. Constancie. To that I consent With my full intent To laude the Lord, Which from errour hath Us all saued By hys precyous word: But God will preserue Them alway fro harme That in hym do truste, So that they wyll Truste in hym styll Andnot in theyr froward lust. Let vs therfore synge Ioyfully it tunynge Our Lord god to prayse, Which doth his defende And grace them sende To walke in a godly way. Charytie. To it I will consent With my harte wholly bent To synge to hym laude. Equytie. So will I gladlye Synge wyth you To the prayse of god. The Songe. Synge wee together Both now and euer To praise the Lord &amp; king, Whiche hath vs saued From the cruell hatred And from his flaterynge. And hath hym subuerted And also tormententid To hys great payne, Which was so euill More wicked then the Deuill To flatter and dysdayne. But now he is gone Of hys wickednes is left none But it is flyt away cleane, So is hys errour Hys malyce and terrour To hys dampnacyon and payne. Constancy. Let vs be gone out of thys place. Charytie. Come I pray you let vs go a pace. Equytie. Let it be so as you do say And let vs go together away We will go come I pray you. Constancye. We will go gladly wyth you. Charytie, Come let vs go &amp; make no more a do. They go out &amp; the kyng entreth &amp; sayth. [Kyng Daryus] My Serua?tes where be you? Come hether quyckly to mee. Preparatus &amp; agreable enter. Ambo. At your c?maundement we bee What is your will to say vs vnto. Kyng Daryus. Go call my Lordes hether to mee. Agreable. It shalbe done as you haue sayd to mee. Preparatus. What so euer you do c?maund mee To do it euer wyll I dylygent bee. Kyng Daryus. Go then foorth quickly &amp; make no more a do But bid them come in hast me vnto. Ambo. Syr god haue you in his custody Wee will go fetche them hether to you. They go out, &amp; Anagnostes &amp; Optimates enter. Optimates. God saue thy grace gentle Kinge I salute thee with much gretynge. Kyng Daryus. Thys is the cause wherfore and why, That I sent for you hether to mee. Optymates. What is the cause? (I pray you vs tell) And if we can we will it fulfyll. Kyng Daryus. They that in my chamber me do kepe C?muned together whylste I was a slepe At last I waking &amp; herynge theyr murmoryng How they talked theyr matter consernynge, They stryue amonge them selues together Euery man to say a weyghtier matter the? the other And he that the best can speake Without fraude or without dysceyte Shalbe rewarded with much good With cattayle also and with food The wrytinges they did delyuer to mee That I might reade them ouer all three Reade it to your selfe I pray you. Optymates. Syr you say very well. Anagnostes. I wyll reade the writinges to you wythout fayle Lysten I pray you vnto mee, Then you shall know the efecte of them all three Whose sayenges is found the best and true With great good kynge Daryus shall him indue He shall haue the ornamentes that here followe And the other lese all through theyr great follye He shalbe endued with purple and golde And with golden cuppes also not olde A Charyot hee shall haue with golden wheles The body therof made with steele And next to kyng Daryus shall syt For hys Eloquence and goodly wyt, He shalbe the kynges famylyer freinde And shall syt by hym to hys lyfe ende, The sentence of the fyrste man is thys Wyne a very stronge thynge is, The second also I will declare to you That the kyng is stronger then any other thyng verely. The thyrde also I will declare Women (sayth hee) is the strongest of all Though by women we had a fall. Theyr myndes now I dyd you tell But aboue all thynges trueth doth most excell. Kyng Daryus. Now let them be called hether Let them come in together Come syrs tary no longer there But before vs do appere, Tell by mouth the effecte of them And to vs showe of them the meane. Stipator primus, Stipator sec?dus &amp; Zorobabell enter. Omnes. Salue vir ornatissime O kynge we salute thee. Kyng Darius. Declare your sentences here by mouth As you haue shewed them by rote. Stipater primus. O men is not wyne very stronge It doth deceyue the very tonge Of it indede somewhat I dyd speake before But now in my memorye I haue a lytle more. Anagnostes. Well say what thou art able But see that it be no vayne fable. Optymates. Go foreward in your matter and do it tell. Kyng Daryus. Gods blessing on youre hart you say very well, Tell vs now what thou hast to say. Stipator primus. The vnderstandyng it taketh away And maketh him carelesse and mery (I saye) No heauynes at all it maketh hym remember That drynketh it, (I do not dyssemble,) It maketh a man to thynke also That the thing which he goeth aboute to do Is good and honest, wheras it is not so He neuer hath memory of any thinge It maketh him forgett that he is a kynge Nor that he doth gouerne or is in aucthorytye And hath al thynges in hys custodye And when they are together drynkynge They do not rem?ber amity nor any other thing But as soone as dronken they are To sleay theyr freind they do not spare Out they draw theyr sword they care not where to hit Thus wine maketh men to haue a small wyt And when from the wyne they are layd downe They can not tell afore what they had done, Iudge now? is not wyne the strongest Which maketh men vnwyttie and vnhonest Hath it not a very great strengthe That causeth these to be done at lengthe. Kyng Daryus. Well now holde thy tonge (I pray thee,) Let the nexte tell his tale to mee. Anagnostes. Do as the kynge hath thee c?maunded. Optimates. Let it be so as they haue thee byd. Sitpator Sec?dus. I did to you declare And now I will not spare To tell my matter to you, The kynge is very stronge And all are in hys hande, That in hys realme continew All do hym obaye Without any delaye That dwell in his Chostes He hath Armyes greate Corne, cattayle and meate And eke haboundant Hostes. How say you, is not he the strongest which doth conquer, &amp; gouerne both man &amp; beast The Land the Sea and euery other thyng? Then strongest is verely the kynge, For he hath domynion ouer them all Both man and beaste are at hys call, And what he c?maundeth that is done If he send them to war they are quyckly gone, They breake downe hils and towers And slay also hyer powers They them selues are slayne also Beyonde hys worde they dare not go, If that they gyt the vyctorye They brynge it to the kynge by and by. And lykewyse they that tyll the grounde when they it reap, they bryng it to the king ro?d Trybute to the kynge they restore, All to hym they brynge both lesse and more, If hee byd them go to kyll They go aboute it with a gaod wyll, If he c?maunde them to forgeue They do it, and theyr cares releiue, If he byd them go and smyte They go aboute it, and care not where they hyt, If he c?maund them to dryue away They do it with out delay. If hee commaund them for to buyld They do it, and theyr labour to hym yelde. If he do byd them for to breake They do it, and that with much wreake. If to plante he do commaunde them They go aboute it lyke obedyent men. The c?mon people and rulers also Are obedyent to hym where so euer they go, And the kyng sitteth downe in the meane while Eatyng and drynkyng, and takyng hys wyll, All to the kynge must obaye And leaue hys owne busynes vndone alwaye Iudge, is not the kyng the strongest nowe? Kyng Daryus. Now tell thy tale vs vnto Stand together you two asyde For of your pourpose you are both wyde. Anagnostes. Declare to vs I pray you now. Optymates. In your two sentenses there is no effecte To them at all we haue no respecte. Zorobabell. The Kynge is myghty and vehement And wine also well spent, Yet of a woman I take in hande And in thys sentence my fayth shall stande It is not the kynge with hys myghty hoste That ruleth and gouerneth in euery Choste Nor it is not wyne that doth excell But to you the trueth I will tell, A woman I suppose it is That ouer these hath domynyon ywysse Hath not the woman borne the kynge And eke euery naturall thynge Hath not women brought them vp all The Uyneyardes wheron wyne dooth fall They make garmentes for all creatures So that they be of humayne statures These can not come without women Therfore the honour we must geue to them If they possesse syluer or precyous golde Theyr hartes are soone very colde If they see a woman welfauoured They forsake theyr golde yt they haue gathered And theyr eyes are bent vpon Theyr harte and mynde on that woman And haue more loue her vnto Then to theyr golde it is true He leaueth his father that brought hym vp Hys mother also that gaue him sucke He forsaketh also his country natyue With that woman all his lyfe to lyue, With the woman also he ieoberdith his lyfe He regardeth neither father nor mother, &amp; alfor his wife, By this then nedes must you know That women haue domynion ouer you. Dooth it greue you that I do tell ye Well, well, it shall not greue mee A man his sworde out dooth take To go and steale he is not slacke To robbe and to sayle vppon the Sea To murther and kyll he is prompte alway And when he hath stollen and also robbed He bryngeth to hys Lemon wtih a good corage Agayne a man loueth hys wyfe Better then he dyd his parentes in hys lyfe Many one in earth there is That loueth his wyfe wonderous well ywisse, Out of theyr wyts also they do run And bond slaues for their wiues sake are become Peryshed also many haue And are become Sathans bond slaue Many also are fallen into syn And all through the cause of women, Beleue me now if you wyll Your myndes I will by and by fulfyll I know a kyng whych is great in powre And al lands st?d in dread of him at this howre, No man vpon hym dare lay hand Nor at any tyme may hym withstand Yet did I see with mine owne eyes Upon the douhter of kynge Bartacus The kynges Concubyne she was trulye Of the kynges ryght hand she sat I tell ye And the crowne from his head tooke And on her head dyd it pute, And with her left hand hym strucke Moreouer the kyng looked vpon her And durst say nothing (he was in such fere, If shee laughed vpon him, he also dyd laughe But if she at him waxed wrothe The kyng was fayne her for to flatter And speke her fayre til he had gotten againe her fauour, O ye men, is not women the greatest of myghte? O thou earth thou art very great The heauen hye with all, Thou canst worke these preaty feates That doth contracte them all. Swyfte is the course of the Sunne The moone the starres also, Whych in the day theyr course do runne Wyth Planets other mo. He fetcheth his course rounde aboute The compas of one day, The starres, the moone, and eke the night Theyr compasse do not staye. He then is very excelente That causeth thys to be done, Whych sytteth aboue the Fyrmament Wythin hys holy throne. But great is the trueth and of good effect And to yt we must haue a diligent respect The earth doth tremble &amp; quake at it ywis And no vngodly thynge in it founde is, Wyne is an vnryghteous thynge, Unryghteous also is the kynge, Women are become vnryghteous also And no goodnes at all can they do, The chyldren of god are vnrygteous all As well the great as is the small, The workes also that they go aboute Is vnryghteous without any doubte, In that vnryghteousnes they shall decaye And perysh also, (it is true that I saye,) In the effecte of that is no vnryghteous thynge No crafte, no polycy, nor no lesynge, Therfore let vs clayme it for our owne And let it depely in vs be sowne, Blessed be thou the god of trueth Let thy trueth be in euery mans mouth. Optimates. O it is a great trueth that thou hast vs tolde To aske of the kynge what thou wilt be yu bolde Thy sentence is great and very curyous And to vs at all it is not greuous. Anagnostes. Aske thy rewarde now I pray thee And thou shalt haue it geuen to thee. Kyng Daryus. Thou hast won of these the vyctorye Thou shalt haue it rewarded to thee Aske what thou wylt I will thee it geue &amp; thou shalt be my freind as long as thou doest lyue, Thou shalt be my famylyer freind And lyue with me to thy lyues ende, Besydes these that are wrytten here, Thou shalt be contentyd for thys gere. Zorobabell. Remember now thy promyse Made to mee of late, Let it now fulfylled bee In reasonable rate. Whych thou promysed vnto mee When thou camest into thy kingdome Lord let that now graunted bee With reasonable fredome. Ierusalem thou dydst promyse To buylde vp euery whyt, And all that therin were amysse Restore agayne to it. Send agayne the Uessels all The Iuels that were taken, As well the greate as eke the small Which were cruelly shaken. Of Cyrus also seperated When in Babylon he offered Thy mind was to build the Temple a gaine which the Edomits brent wtout faine When Ierusalem was peruerted And greuously tormented And of the Cauldies deiected That o kynge I do desyre And with my whole harte do it requyre Performe thy vowe therfore Whych thou hast promysed heretofore. Kyng Daryus. I prayse thee wonderous well thou shalt haue that which before I did thee tell. Zorobabell. Now syr we must departe awaye God haue you all in his custodye I saye. Stipator primus, Stipator sec?dus &amp; Zorababell go out. Kyng Daryus. God prosper your iourney &amp; send you good succes And saue you fr? your ennemies harmles Do you intend to tary here. Optimates. What is your will to do I pray you tell it vs vnto. Anagnostes. Gladly syr wolde wee go awaye, To tary here wee will not delaye. Kyng Daryus. Come then let vs go hence (I pray you.) Ambo. We are content so to do. Here they go out, and then entreth Constancy sayeng as it were a Sublocutio. [Constancie.] You haue harde here good people of late Of three yonge men, their saiengs by rote by mouth they did resite I thinke you haue hard How the flaterers were cruelly abhord Two there were Stipators they may be called ywis They w?t about by flatery, but yet they did mis But Constancy is a thynge moste suer In it nothinge vncleane, but all very puer, The thyrde Zorobabell by name, Dyd remayne in constancye and kepe the same, The sayinge I suppose you do vnderstand Yet to showe you agayne I will take in hand The one declareth the strength of wyne, How it doth deceyue the frealty of the brayne. The second also dooth expresse That the kyng had the most strength doubtlesse But wicked men they be, and also flaterers They may wel ynough be called Stipators. Then the thyrde the trueth to tell dyd begyn The vyctory of them all he dyd wyn, He remayned in Constancye and was still wyse As for flatery styll he dyd dyspyse, Thus haue you harde the effecte of all How that for theyr lyes they haue got a fall. Here entreth Equity &amp; Charity. Pray we to god the Lord of myght That he wold send downe his cleare syght To Queene Elyzabeth &amp; send her his worde That from her ennemyes she may be restorde, Let vs also pray that shee longe may lyue, And that to her subiectes true precepts she may gyue. Equyty &amp; Charyty. For the Councellours also let vs pray That in the true fayth derecte them he may, And that also grace he wolde them geue To geue councell wysely wile in earth they liue. (Amen.) The Songe. Let the trueth, let the trueth Be in euery mans mouth Both yonge and olde, Let hym be bolde With trueth to holde, Leaste they perysh Lyke Hogges swynysh And vtterly decaye. Then he shalbe sure Longe to endure Abrode in earth And from the dearth God will kepe hys harte Also from punyshment And from cruell iudgement For euer and for aye. In Constancye remayne Let no venome you stayne But flee it quyte And the ryght way hyt Spurne not agaynst the prycke But be humble and meke And for grace seke To the lyuynge god I saye.
