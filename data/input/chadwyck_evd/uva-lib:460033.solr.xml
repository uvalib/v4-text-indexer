      <field name="fulltext">THE False FRIEND, Or, the FATE of DISOBEDIENCE. A TRAGEDY:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE COUNTESS OF BURLINGTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. By Mr. Hodgson. Amongst Reformers of this Vitious Age, Who think it Duty to Refine the Stage: A Woman, to Contribute, does Intend, In Hopes a Moral Play your Lives will Mend. Matters of State, she'l not pretend to Teach; Or Treat of War, or things above her Reach: Nor Scourge your Folly's, with keen Satyrs Rage; But try if good Example will Engage. For Precepts oft do fail from Vice to win, And Punishments but harden you in Sin. Therefore (Male Judges) She prescribes no Rule And knows 'tis vain to make Wise Men of Fools. Lest all those Wholesom Laws that she can give, You'd think too much below you to receive. âThat part then of the Reformation, Which she believes the fittest for her Station; Is, to shew Man the surest way to Charm: And all those Virtues, Women most Adorn. First then,âNo Beau can e're Succesful prove, Narcissus like, who's with himself in Love. No wretched Miser must e're hope to find, With Chest's Lok'd up, a Friend 'mongst Woman kind. No Drunkard, Fool, Debauchee, or one that Swears, Can Win a Woman, or beguile her Fears; But he that's Honest, Generous, and Brave, That's Wise and Constant, may his Wishes have. But Hold, I'de forgotâ You must not be Ill-natur'd and Unkind, Moroseness Suits not with their Tender Minds. They are all soft, as is the Down of Doves, As Innocent and Harmless are their Loves; And those Misfortunes which on Men do fall, To their False Selves they Chiefly owe 'em all. Did Men Reform, all Women wou'd do well: In Virtue, as in Beauty they'd Excell. But while each strive the other to Betray, Both are to Fears and Jealosie's a Prey. Let not Ill-nature then Reign here to Night, Nor think you shew most Wit, when most you Spite; But Strive the Beauties of the Play to find, The Modest Scenes, and Nicest Actions mind, Then to your Selves, and Authress you'l be kind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. The Author, who the Foregoing Scenes has Writ Design'd to shew you Nature more than Wit; Tho', one wou'd think no wonder cou'd be greater, Than to see any Forsake our Leader, Nature. For She shou'd hold the Lamp, when we Indite, And Dictate every Thought and Line we Write Nay, all think they have her Presence and her Light. When as the Coy Daphne fled from our Apollo, Nature flyes Poets, and in Vain they Follow. This Offspring still is Jilted worse than he, Who for a kind soft Nimph, Embrac'd a Tree; Yet why this Vain pursuit of her at last, If she flyes Poets, you fly her as fast; Nay, yo are grown so very Ripe for Satyre, As much as ye each other Love, ye hate her. For when did she e're please this Barborous Age, When all things else have taken on the Stage. New Bullies, Blustering in Heroick Fustian, In your Fermenting Masses, rais'd Combustion. Anon, we hush'd your forward Mood with Battles, And made our Trumpets, and our Drums your Rattles. But Gallants, since you are weary grown of these, Let Humane Nature, Humane Creatures please. All loose Expressions now are Banish'd hence, Our Senses are only Fraught with Innocence. Virtue Arises. Her Snowy Garment bears a Dazeling white, Protect ye Beauties, the grace in which ye all delight, And save the Hapless Lovers you have seen to Night.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Hall. Enter Emilius, Lovisa, Servants. Emil. Safely we'ave reach't Sardinia's Shore Thou tender, Beauteous kindest Charmer For which, Bless'd be the Bounteous Powers: Blest be every Auspicious Star! But, Oh! What Blessings shall I pour on thee, Source of my Days! My Life! My Lovisa! On this pleasing Subject my charm'd Tongue wou'd for ever dwell, And wish my Eyes cou'd yet speak more, To Express thy wondrous Kindness, My Almighty Love! Lov. Oh! My Emilius! Emil. Ha! A Sigh! Thy lovely Eyes shining faintly! What means This cruel Alteration! Not fiercest Storms, when the Mad Waves Danc'd highest, and, in their surly Sport, Toss'd us from side to side, mov'd thee thus! No; Thou wert Calm as Innocence: Calm As Eastern Groves, and with a Smile wou'd Cry: Fear not; I can Dye with my Emilius! And now we Ride Securely in the Haven, What rude Gust dares disturb that Halcyon Bosome, Where I have Horded all my precious Stock of Peace, and built my Rest for eve. Lov. Is it nothing then, to break the strongest Ties; Ties which even Barbarians hold most Sacred: Forsake Parents, Family, my Native Land: Nay worse; leave my Fame at Random: For the malicious World to Censure; whose Vile Breath scarce spares the brightest Virtue? How will it blacken my Errors! Is this Not worth a Sigh! No; Emilius he is mine; And he out-weighs 'em all! Emil. Come to my Heart thou Darling softness In thy own Mansion Reign. Oh! What Transporting Pleasures does't thou give, The earnest of Love's rich Feast, which I, the Happy I, shall now receive. Lov. Alas! Emil. Nay! If thou break'st the Chain, my pleas'd Imagination forms, I shall suspect thy Love; For I appeal to Thee, with all my Foes (thy Coldest Guards about thee) if, to a Tittle I Have not obey'd thy hard Conditions: When In France, I snatch'd thee from thy Destin'd Bridegroom? 'Tis true; we were so close persu'd, We scarce had time to Tye the Sacred Knot our selves: I just cou'd call thee Wise, my Charming Bride! You Injoyn'd, and I obey'd, tho' my Heart Rowl'd in Fire, I beheld thee like an Anchorite, But now the cruel Task is o're, and I will Seize thee, Lock thee in these fond Arms; Warm thee With my Sighs; and fill thee with the Fury of my Love. Lov. Hear me Emiliusâtho' unwillingly I wake thee from thy Dreams of Bliss. Yet I have Fears, that wrack my Soul! And to whom, but thee, shou'd I disclose 'em? Therefore I must be heard. Emil. What, wou'd my Angel say? Or why Do ye repeat the Injunction to be heard? Did I e're fly the Musick of thy Tongue, Or listen to it, with less respect: Than what we pay to Oracles Divine? Lov. You have brought me to Sardinia, Where Your Father's LordâYou are his Eldest, and his only HopesâIn the Spanish Court, He no doubt, has chose some Princess, To prop his Name from Sinking, and Bless Your Genial Bed: What will then Become of me! Emil. My Love! Lov. I have no Witness of my Noble Birth [Pointing to her Woman. But that poor helpless Wretchâ Nay, shou'd there be Enquiry made, My angry Father, for my Disobedience May disown meâIf they by Threats, Or Prayers, Draw you too on their side: Then I shall be left Expos'd in this Inhospitable Isle; perhaps wounded With opprobrious Names; Call'd a Wandring loose One; a wanton Mistress; Save me Emilius, from that Thoughtâ Save me quick: It tears my Heart asunder! Emil. Why dost thou Wound me with thy grondless Fearsâthy most unkind Suspicions? Yet, if there's power in Words, thou sha't be Satisfi'dâHear ye Just Avengers! Hear this kneeling Imprecationâ If e're my Heart incline to any other Beautyâ If to the last ruddy drop, that Animates this Frame I not protect thee, my dearest Part my Wifeâ If I am not proud to own, and honour thee in All Prospirities, or worst Extremities: Let me Live the most detested of my Raceâ Hated by all good Men: And Curs'd by Heav'n! Lov. Hold my Dear Lord! Emil. No! Upon this Theme I will Exceed; and yet Not talk too muchâWinds bear my Wordsâ And Treasure 'em amongst their blewest Plagues, And dash 'em back upon this Perjur'd Head: When I, in thought, Forsake her! Lov. No more! I will, I will believe thee!â Emilius has said it: And Truth it self Will sooner Change then he! Emil. to a Servant. I attend her hereâ [Enter a Servant, and whispers Emilius. âThe Lady (my Blessing to Whose Protection I shall Commit thee, Till I've wrought my Father to a Consent. Lov. Is she good, and kind, Emilius? Emil. She was my Mother's valu'd Care; left By her Parents young: Ever bred With my Sister, and my self. Large are her Possessions in both the Indies and in Spain, Yet all Matches she refuses, and in my Father's Court Exhausts her vast Revenues. What e're Requests to him I made, By her they were convey'd; by her obtain'd.âShe comes, Retire a Moment, whilst I relate the Story of our Loves. Lov. Which shou'd she disapproveâ Emil. Impossible, she will be pleas'd, indeed she will [Leads her out and returns. All shall be well. Enter Appamia, and Zelide. App. Emilius! Cou'd you think our Joys For your return wou'd, by Surprize, Receive addition: That you gave No warning o'the Blessing. Emil. Oh my best Friend; most Excellent Of Women! Friendship was Languid Till you receiv'd the Sacred Fire, and rais'd it To those Heights, Natures almighty Master First Ordain'd: Before designing Fraud, And little Arts were us'd! App. On any Theme you speak well, Emilius. Tho' I'de hear nothing, but what relates to your self. Emil. How much I am oblig'd, it is Impossible To say; Yet like honest Debtors, I'de reckon up The mighty Summ, e're I run further in the Score. App. Hold, Emilius, I conjure thee hold! The pleasure of serving you, Rewards My utmost Care. Emil. Oh! You are All Goodness; and her Fears Were Vain. App. [starting.] Her! What Her? Emil. Nay Start not, Madam;âTo the Noble Stock of Friendship I have only added A little tender Branch; which Nourish'd under you Shall kindly pay you back with Faith, and Love Like mine. App. What can Emilius mean? Emil. In France, it was my Fate to see a Lady, Of whose Beauty I shall forbear to speak, Because your Eyes will be the JudgeâIt is Enough, to say, she caught my Heart In Everlasting Chains.âIn the Gallantry, The French Court allows, I found daily means To tell my fair Saint, the Victory her Charms Had won; and she at Length, Listen'd with A Relenting Ear; drew me from the Terrors. Of Despair; for mine was no Common Wandring Fire, which Time, or Absence, or Some other Beauty might have Cur'd: There Was no Medium in the firceness of my Love: I must be the most wretched of Mankind, or the Happiest. App. Oh Emilius! Were these the Studies. Thou wert sent to Learn? Is thy Father's Care, and my incessant Kindness Thus repay'd? Emil. Confusion to my Hopes! Appamia Weeps! My Friend, and my Protectress Weeps! At her Emilius's Joys! App. No!âPray Sir proceedâZeledeâ Thy ArmâI am, Sick o'th suddain! Emil. Madam!â App. Nay, I beseech you Sir, go onâIs Your Choice of Noble Birth. Emil. As any France can boast of. App. Why was your Father, then not made Acquainted? Why, in that Point alone, Were your Letters sent to me? Still silent. Emil. I did design it all; when from Lovisa's Mouth I knew my Fate; but, Oh! Just as with Down-cast Eyes, a blushing Face, trembling Hand, Her soft Breath stole through the Rosie Doors In broken Accents; Words half kind, and half Conceal'd: Just as my Ravish'd Heart Receiv'd the Blessing, and warm Extasies Took place of Chilling Fears: When Every Thought, and every Wish, and Every Look was Love:â App. [aside.] Good Heav'n! How eagerly he talks! Emil. Even in this perfect State of Bliss, Her cruel Father was Bartering my Inestimable Fair: Bargain'd with a Neighbouring Lord, for Dirt, and Acres; Sold my Goddess like a Common Nothing Of the Sex; that World of Beauty, for which My aching Heart had paid a faithful Slavery, Must be thrown into the sordid Arms of One Who Gaz'd not on her Eyes, but on the Gold! App. Hast to the Issue; you dwell too long Upon Description. Emil. In fine, the Marriage Day was Set, but I resol'v'd upon the Bridegroom's Death, Or to receive my ownâwhen my Kind dear One, helpt by her Confident, Escap'd; Gave me her self; with the Rich Prize I fled; found a good Priest, Who made us One; and here as fully Trusting you: I've brought her my Virgin BrideâReceive her Madam, as the [Enter Lovisa. Heart of your Emilius: For every Injury That's offer'd her, I shall feel it there. App. Like that, she shall be Cherish'd; and find No other Usuage, then the Heart of Emilius. From me deserves. Lov. If, Madam, you have never felt Love's Power, I from your Prudence must expect severest Censures for my Rashness. App. Emilius has a bewitching Tongue His Person too, I think may Justifie A Lady's Fondness. Emil. Your Kindness makes ye PartialâSee, How I trust That Kindness, when I Deliver up to you this Rich Gift of Fate. Lov. You talk, as if you were to leave me long, Tell us rather the Methodâwhat's your porpose? Emil. I'le to my Father's Palace, which adjoyns, and Learn how to proceed; begging my best Friend, My dear Appamia this Day, to Conceal my Blessing from prying Eyes; from any Gazers, but in whom she dares confide, At Night I will return. App. Your Sister will prove your Advocate; She loves you, and has great Power O'er your Father's Will; you ask not, After herâBut one in Love, Like you, must be forgiven, if; His Relations, and Friends are all forgot. Lov. Wrong not your Friend, most Charming Of your Sex; for many pleasing Hour, Have I heard Emilius recount your Virtues, And the fair Adellaida's: Nor Madam, Look on worthless me, with disdainful Eyes: Since I hope not many Leagues from hence, I have a Noble Brother. App. In Sardinia? Lov. In the Court of Spain: Count Brisac. App. The Count Brisac. Lov. Do ye know him Madam? App. No; I have heard of him; and slightly Saw him, when he met Their Majesty's In their last Progress. Emil. I never saw him; but have from Fame, A Generous Character; and hope, when We do meet, it will be like Brothers. App. No doubt on't; but if I might Adviseâ Emil. Call it Command. App. You shou'd not too suddainly Declare your Marriage; If this Lady can Brook a short Retirement: I'le Manage it for the good of both. Lov. Oh! I cou'd live in Caves, or unfrequented Desarts: So I now and then, might see Emilius! App. Every Minute, 'tis but a Gallery parts us From the Pallace; his Duty paid to the Vice-roy, What hinders but he in few Hours, may return: His Familiarity here will be easily Excus'd. Emil. Bless'd be the Breath that leads me on to Bliss: The dear Indulgent Guide to what my Heart desiresâ E're a Balmy Slumber has half refresh't My Love, I'le fly to wake thee with my Kisses. Lov. Oh! Do not think Sleep, or Rest will close These watry Eyes, or ease this Throbbing Heart, Till I behold thy Face agen! App. Emilius, I am considering fartherâ Suppose you pass'd this Day Disguis'd; Or to your Sister only made a Discovery; Then she, and I might break the Matter To my Lord, and hear how he resents it E're he knows the bottom. Emil. With all my Heart; that way I shall spare The welcomes of Crouding Friends, which Wou'd, at this time detain me from my Wishes My long Absence, and unexpected Arrival Has pass'd me hitherto unknown. App. Stay not with Adellaida to tell your Story, Only learn Intelligence, and leave me to Explain ye. Emil. I will.âOne lookâone Smile, and I am gone. [to Lovisa. Lov. Forgive my Fears! Emil. Which shall be short, as my Return is SwiftâFrom thee With heavy Foot-steps unwillingly I move But I shall fly to meet agen my Love. [Exit. App. Zelide, Conduct this Fair Traveller to My Alcove: Repose, I am sure, is requisite, After your Fatigues. Lov. I will retire; not to Sleep, But my dear Emilius, think on thee: When our Thoughts please, Solitude's Felicity. [Exit Lovisa, Zelide, App. When our Thoughts please, Solitude's Felicity! O ye Just Powers! Is this proportion'd Right! Must hers Transport; whilst mine, like Hurricans, scatter the labouring Brain, that Forms 'em, into a Thousand painful Atoms? I'le ha' no more on't; but fold my Arms, and Fix my Eyes; and stupifie the rowling Torments Till I am senseless grown: A Statue, Stiff, and Motionless! Re-enter Zelide. Zel. How d'ye, Madam? App. Well; my Eyes are Dry, and Heart is still. Zel. I am glad you bear it so. App. Why, Faithful Creature, why dost weep? Have I lost ought? Can I complain? It seems, he did not know I lov'd. Zel. True Madam. App. Oh! Falser, Baser, than his whole Dissembling RaceâHe knew it well, And brought his Minion here, to Brave me With his ScorneâI must prepare the Bridal Bed; with Leaves of Roses Deck the downy Pillows! Oh! Barbarity. Zel. Return it Madam; Disdain, the Disdainer; To his Father's Pallace; send the Fugitive; And think of him no more. Is there. A Grandee, even near the Throne, but Courts Your Favour? If this ill-plac'd Love has got too near Your Heart, go to the charming Western Climes, and Reign a Princess there, as the vast Donation of your Parents left ye'âyou mind not Madam, what I say! App. Indeed I do not. Am I ugly, Zelide; very ugly? Zel. Not Michael Angelo could Paint a finer Face. App. Foul, as thy Flattery! Yet I believe thou Art faithful; tho' I like it not Express'd this wayâ What cou'd he think my Letters meant; or What the Mighty Summs, by me Remitted, to Keep their Grandeur up? Zel. He thought not on ye Madam; his Eyes were taken up with a fair Fool, That never had oblig'd him. App. Ha!âI begin to wakeâ What was't, but slighted Love, made Medea Prove a Fury? doubtless her Breast was, Once as soft, as Fond, as Innocent as mine; As free from black Revenge, or Dire Mischiefsâ Rise ye Furies! Instead of Tresses, Deck me With your Curling Snakes!âFor I will sting 'em all to Death! Zel. Here are hundreds will obey your Orders. App. No; it shall be done without a Noiseâ How quick is Hell Invok'd! The Seeds of Ruine grow pregnant, the very Moment They are Sown!âknow'st thou, Zelide, That Woman (I hate to Name Lovisa)â He did it with so much Tendernessâ Know'st thou I say, Brisac's her Brother? And know'st thou too, Brisac Don Lopez? Zel. What? That Don Lopez whom Adellaida, This Morning Marry'd: I know in part the Story: Dear Madam inform me fully. App. Yes. In the late Progress, made with the King And Queen, wherein the Duke d' Alberquerque, My Uncle, took Adellaida, and my self, to meet The Court, there we saw Brisac, Adellaida charm'd him; I (see how Fate returns it) favour'd their Amours, And he follow'd to Sardinia, and was Receiv'd as my Relation; Don Lopez a Man of Quality, in the West-Indies. Zel. Why might not his pretentions have been Allow'd as the Lord Brisac? App. Oh! 'tis just the Counter-blow of Fate! Neither of the Fiery Youths had power to stay The Spanish Grave proceedings; and so They're both undoneâand what am I! Zel. Happy, and Blest! Fortune's largest Gifts are yours. App. No, Zelide, No!âCome near, and I will Tell thee what a Wretch I am! Let thy Eye run o're all the miserable things Thou hast Seen, or Read of: yet let thy Fancy Make it worseâSee Leprous Beggars Prisoners Ten Fathom Deep, In New Drain'd Wells; and Ingendring Toads With all their bloatted Brood crawling o're 'em! Zel. Oh Horrid! App. Youth Bury'd alive in Strength and Vigour; Parents by their Rebellious Children Torn; Yet all this cannot equal mine. Zel. Strange Disposition of our Fate!â The Great, for little Causes, make themselves Unfortunate. App. Is it nothing then, to see another Clasp him? Oh! I am lost, if I look that way! Zel. Throw Emilius from your thoughts, and you Are Happy. App. What after being the lov'd Image there! Since first they took an Image inâ Forget himâwhen he Anticipated my Earlyest Prayers, and was my Evening Theme, My Mid night Wakings have Remembred him; Made the joyn to wish his Safety: And talk'd away the Starry Hours, till thou hast, Nodding, ask'd, what I said lastâweary with Tormenting thee, have flown from my Bed, To Trees and Shadows; Breath'd his Name thereâ Methought I beheld his goodly Mien, in Whispering Boughs heard the soft Accents of His Voiceâand Dy'd upon the SoundâOh! Zel. This way, you never will forgett him. App. 'Twas the last Sighs of my Expiring Love; And from the Death of that I Rise Another WomanâThe gentle Cords, Twisted by Venus's self, that held my Heart, Are Broke; and in their Stead, Nemesis has Writ his Fate in Bloody Characters. Zel. In all things I Obey. App. I know thou woot, without Enjoyning. Zel. Command me then. App. Bucarius, our General, (you know) my Lover, Hates the Vice-roy, and fears the return of brave Emilius, Mistrusts the Governour shou'd Supplant him in the Court of Spain, purchase His Honours for his most deserving Son, this Will make him Eager to Cross the Noble Youth In his Designs, it shall be so;â Warn him hither; He fits my purpose: Give Adellaida, From me, Notice to speak with Caution, to her Broher, And let my Servants be in readiness, shou'd my Design fail in the deep Scheme I have laid, I am sure I have my Rival in my Power; And if she scapes, may I be only wretchedâ Observe me Zelideâtho I fear we both must fall. Zel. I am Content when you are pleas'd. App. O Faithful Slave! India alone can breed thy Fellow! Zel. I was a Slave till your goodness rais'd me To your Bosom, which when Death frights me from May I be a Slave again! App. If now my Native softness I forego; And Plunge my self in everlasting Woe: Let none my Black, and Guilty Annals see; Or if they do: Charge Love; but pity me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter the Vice-Roy, Adellaida, Don Lopez, Lorenza. Vice. My Adellaida! perfect Image of thy Mother, Sweet in thy obedience; and of Temper gentle! Let not thy careful Fathers Precepts be thought Only the Effects of peevish Age; and thrown From thy Remembrance like those uneasy Rules, which unwillingly we hear, And ne'er design to practise! Adel. What have I done to merit this Reflection? Why am I thought so vile? what mighty Error have I in my Conduct shown, to make my Noble Father talk thus! to break the Heart That's fill'd with Reverence and Love Towards him, Great as his tender Care Can in a grateful Brest produce. Vice. I accuse thee not my Child, and indeed I Justly cannot: Thy prudent Youth has out-done Our Celebrated Matrons, with Joy I have beheld Your unaffected Care; and trusting to your Discretion, wav'd the nicer Customs of our Spain, And given you Liberty to your utmost wishes. Adel. Do you repent your kindness, Sir? Else, why is it mention'd now? Vice. No. Yet I will tell thee, Adellaida Foreboding Dreams Torture My sick Fancy; my Peace of mind is Shockt Most unaccountablyâthy Brother Emilius, The other half of my divided Heart, And thee are the only Treasures Fate can Wound me in, for I have learnt So much Philosophy, to quit Honour, and Wealth freely, as I wou'd my Garments, Whem my wearied Body longs for rest. Adel. Our last Letters left my dearest Brother in perfect Health. Vice. True; they did soâ Yet be Cautious my belov'd be Cautions let thy Father's fears Set thy prudence on the Watch. Hark! [Horn Winds without. The Huntsman callsâ I'le try in Sports to drive this Melancholy Apprehensions offâmy Adellaida, Farewell. Adel. Much Diversion wait on your Highness. Don Lopez aside to Adel. My Life! Stay but a Moment here: I'le instantly return, [Exit. Adel. I willâAmida, come hitherâ The rest retireâDidst thou not [Exeunt Women. The rest retireâDidst thou not Tremble at my Fathers Speeches? Ami. Indeed I was surpriz'd. Adel. Oh! He's Divinely good; and the just Powers Will Reveal my Disobedience; or punish it With some unforeseen Misfortuneâ To boast of Filial Duty, yet break it in The Highest pointâTo give my self away, Without this Dear Indulgent Father's knowledgeâ Horrid Impiety! Unpardonable Crime! Ami. See the Lov'd Cause; and Cease your vain Lamentings. Re-enter Brisac. Adel. Oh! my Brisac! Why have we been so rash? Why did we not stay for the Paternal Blessing? Which wou'd have remov'd this Cloud Of Sorrows, that sink all hopes of Dawning Comfort. Bris. Not Comfort! to me the Hours come Fraught With Bliss! the very Sound that thou art mine! That Adellaida's my Bride wou'd Chear me In a Dungeon! Oh thou Beauteous Wonder of the Earth! the Musick of whose Voice alone wou'd charm a Lunatick; And make the Wrack-stretch'd Slave Forget his pain, Gazing upon Thy Eyes Dye pleas'd; and think his Happiness was there! Then shall we repine, or fear our Future Fate? When we Command her Richest store; When the Blessings of Transporting Love is ours? Adel. How vain are all the Cautions of our Sex; How weak the best Resolves of Woman-kind! What boots it now to boast, my Eyes ne'er gave A Glance of kindness, or Ears inclin'd to the Delusive stories of my Numerous Loversâ I stay'd but till the Fated Spoiler came Then, at Random, Stak'd my Heart, my Liberty; Whatever I had priz'd before: And only sigh'd, when I could give no more! Bris. Oh Adellaida! Why dost thou please so well; That I mistrust the greatness of my Joys; and Fear, no Mortal must long remain in such Exalted Happinessâwhen thus I grasp Thy Hand, and look upon thy lovely Face, My Senses in Alarm, Croud and hurry Altogether; the tumultuous Pleasures Gather round my Heart; and with my utmost Reason I can scarce determine, whether This is real, or some Visionary Bliss. Adel. These are a Bridegroom's Extasies.â But, my Brisac, woo't thou talk Thus, when, after many Rowling Years, Thou hast lost that Name; when I have lost The mighty Charm of being new; Nay, perhaps, when both our Angry Fathers with Hatred May pursue us; Drive us among humble Villagers: Thou an Inhabitant of some Barren Plain; and I the Mistress only of a little Cell: Woo't thou then revive me with Love like this? And make our Low-built Cottage Happier far Than Palaces, whose Turrets wrap their Aspiring Tops in Clouds; or Crouded Cities, Where Ten Thousand lay their Anxious Heads, and never know such peace as ours! Bris. All must be Peace near thee; Joy settles Round thy Habitation; and Blooming Pleasures spring at thy Lov'd sight! Adel. Oh! Thou dost talk away the Minutes, forgetting Our Restraintâwithdraw, or we shall Be Observ'd. Bris. Not till you have Promis'dâ Adel. What? Bris. To be this Night at our obliging Friends, The kind Appania's Adel. Impossible! Bris. Most easy. Command your other Women To retire; then with the faithful Amidea When all the Court is still, pass the Long Gallery: There's no shadow of a Danger. Adel. Yet my Heart trembles at this thought? Bris. Eager Love shall drive thy Causeless Fears Away. Appania, Pitifull And kind, as her soft Sex Inspires, Prepares the Bridal Bed, Adorn'd with all The Sweets, that ever Bounteous Nature gaveâ But, Oh! What need of Odors, when thou art there? Amid. Madam, One of the Pages is just Entring. Adel. Be gone my Lord. Bris. You will comeâ Adel. I think not. Bris. Those Charming Eyes, my better Friends, Speak kinder things. Adel. Then trust to them: and leave me To Blush alone. Bris. A Taste of Bliss,â'tis Sweet, as Health or Liberty: It glides thro' ev'ry Vein; and Centers at my Heart; Yet will I try to gain another Hour, else Shall I hate the flow passing Day, repine at The All Chearing Sun, and dye with Eager Expectation Of the Friendly Night, Night Sacred to Lovers Joys And Covert to the Blushing Bride; for Oh What place, in Absence can my Spirits chear, When all my Ravish'd Heart admires is here? [Exit. Enter a Page. Page. This Note from the Princess Appamia; Also a Gentleman, who beggs to speak with you In Private. Adel. Reading. Mention your Marriage but with Caution; Let me see you, E're you name the Happy Man! You'll be pleasing surpriz'd: I'le say no more, Lest I forestall it. Yours, Appamia. Hast! Admit the Stranger; then let none interrupt usâ Why doth Appamia Write in Riddles? Enter Emilius. Emil. Madamâ Adel. Nay; no Sett SpeechesâI know theeâ By all the Blessings of this day, 'Tis heâ He himself, my own, my dear, My lov'd EmiliusâOh! Brother! what do the Bounteous Heavens mean by this profuse Addition? Emil. Adellaida! Adel. I won't stop, nor ask a Reason for thy Disguise, Or odd appearance; but talk wildly on, And rest Secur'd I have thee here! Emil. My Sisterâyet still the Dearer Name's behindâ My Friend! Blood is the Tye of common Souls; a Sordid Earthly LinkâFriendship! The Noble Workmanship of Heav'n! Adel. Art thou return'd thou Wanderer! Emil. I am. Adel. Yes, Yes; I see thou art, my pleas'd Eyes Behold thee not Alter'd, nor Estrang'd, Thy Looks their wonted kindness bear; and I am blest. Emil. My Adellaida, I begg thee cease Help and Assist me with thy utmost Power. Adel. Is there a Power in me to serve Emilius! And am I not Commanded? Emil. Without my Fathers License, I have Ventur'd backâI prithee Sister, choose Some Auspicious Hour to Reveal itâ Nay go farther yet my Sister; let him Suppose I am Harden'd grown in Disobedience; Have made a bold disposal of my self, Without Consulting him, from whom I had My BeingâThen if his Fury Rise (as much I fear it will) with all thy winning Sweetness, (Melting, and soft) Curb the just Tempestâ Plead for thy Brother; as I wou'd do for Adellaida. Adel. Oh Sir! Emil. Ha! What mean these Ominous Tears?â 'Tis Strange! I cannot mention the Blessing of My Life; the Business of my Love, to my Best Friends: but strait I meet the Face Of SorrowâOh Adellaida! Had'st thou To me committed ought of this Import: I wou'd not thus have Check'd thy Blooming Hopes! Adel. Twins were we in the Womb, and since our Birth By our Father equally Belov'd; for my poor Mother dy'd E're we could Taste her kindnessâ Both too, I think have trod the Paths of Virtue; Both aim'd at the rich Standard of all Generous minds, Immortal Honourâ But if both have fail'dâ Emil. In what? Adel. In Duty, BrotherâIf Love has Broke The Holy Ramparts down; and left us Expos'd, Like the first Pair: Will our Adhering to Each other Avert the Wrath of Heaven, And our great Parent? Emil. Expos'd the Wrath of Heav'n!â What hast thou done, my better half? Adel. Even that rash thing, I guess you guilty ofâ Which I shou'd never have dar'd to own, Had you not by Example Taught me boldnessâ Than Gordian Knot Which few Escape, and yet by fewer is easy made By me is Ty'd, without my Father's knowledgeâ I am Marriedâthink thou my Brother, What an Advocate, you have chose, whose Every Argument, us'd for you, bears for her self, The same Validity, and Weight! Emil. What strange Game of Fortune's this? The more I think, the more I am Confus'd. Adel. Yet you are a Man; and will, I am sure; look Danger Boldly in the Face: But I, a Woman, fearful As a Hind, when the full Cry is up; and all are Bent Upon the Slaughterâtherefore I beg, when the Discovery's made, you'l be my Protector, and Prove a Brother; tho by an Angry Father I'm forsaken. Emil. Oh Adellaida! To look too far, is wild amazeâ Hush then our Faults, and let us talk no moreâ Let us forget this Interview till to morrowâ And if thou hast such a Prospect, as my pleas'd Fancy Paints: No Suffering can outweigh the Blissful Hours, 'Twixt the Setting, and the Rising Sun. Adel. Promise only, that you'l Love my Husband; That My Father shan'not force, Your Noble Arm against him, and I am satisfi'd. Emil. I do. Adel. Nay, but you shall Swear. Emil. What wou'dst thou ha' me Swear? Aeol. Kneel thus with me, and Swear; that as I'le prove faithful to your Beauteous Choice Fulfilling every wish, and word of hers, So you'l protect, and love the Lord, That Rules your Sister's Heart. Emil. I Sware I will, but why so nice a fear. When I injure him, Fate Deeper Wound the darling my Soul is fond ofâHa! Adel. Why start you Brother? Emil. Methinks, as thus we kneel, thus Strengthning each other in highest Disobedience: Red hissing Bolts Are forming to Consume us! Adel. Alas Emilius! Emil. 'Twas a Cross thoughtâBut let all Be forgot, as these past MomentsâName me not Nor think of me, till next we meet; Then Appamia shall direct us. I hear the Huntsman's Horn; and guess my Father Is returningâNo word of me I beg. Adel. My Tongue I will CommandâBut my thoughts are full of thee, As thine, I hope, sometimes remember me. [Exit severally. Enter Vice-Roy, Lorenza; Attended. Vice. The Lowering Heavn's all Sullen as the Fate I fear, Conspire to Increase this most unwelcome Load upon my Drooping Spirits! The Day, Lorenzo, which was as fair at our up-rising, As Gaudy Nature cou'd put on, is now reverst; The Sun Wrapt up in Sable Clouds, Seems To hasten his Delightful Course; and long To Sett in Darkness! Lor. Such are the Joys of Humane kind; Uncertain, as the Seasons! So Fortune Tempts us With a Smiling Face; and (in a Moment) Sickness, Death, or Cruel Disappointment Blasts Our growing Expectations! Vice. True, Lorenza; yet thou complain'st not By Experience, or the weight of Sorrows: But like the Common Vogue of the World; That still Cries out, The Times are hard. Fate grows blinder; more unjust than ever, With a Knavish Partial Hand Scatters Her Favours: Missing none but the Deserving! This Complaint the present Age always thinks Is new: When (alass!) their Fore-Fathers Always said the same.â But prethee, Lorenza, leave thou such AffectationâThy Fortune's large; Thy Character is good; Noble thy Birth; And all the Blessings of a prosperous Youth, Attend thee. Lor. My Gallant Friend! Venerable Governour! Say, Rather all the Curses. Vice. How! Lor. The Wretch that in a Raging Feaver Lies, Whose parch'd-up Soul Hunts round the Burning Clay, wherein it is Confin'd, and sighs but for a Cool retreat: were he Lord of the Universe, Wou'd he not give it all for Liquid Draughts Of Quenching Water; Sound his Big Titles, In his Ears; Disclose his Hoarded Wealth; Lull him with Enchanting Songs; Surround him With the Various Pleasures, Luxury in Health, And Power Invented; wou'd this make him Happy? No! Like me amidst the hateful Bustle, He'd beg for Ease, or Death. Vice. Folly, and Madness! Thou hast no cause. Lor. Not Cause! Is not all the Happiness my Heart Can guess at, or my mind can Frame, Treasur'd In Beauteous Adellaida? And doth not the Disdainful fair still view me with relentless Eyes! Like the Coy Daphne, Fly my Loath'd pursuit Shun me, as she wou'd Infection! O must Accurst! Hated by Adellaida, Why do I Live? Why Drag This Irksome Being, round a World, where Nothing else can please! Vice. Far from thy Soul be such a thought my Son! She hates the not; but fearful, unknowing yet Mankind, will only try thy Faith, e're She, for Life Surrender. Lor. Oh! had I grounds for that kind hope: I'de not Exchange the Prospect of such Bliss, to be Spains Monarch, or the United Worlds! Vice. Have you not my Approbation? and is she not The Pattern of Obedience? I own (won by her Sweetness) I did promise not to force her Inclinations; but I know she wou'd as Soon forgoe her Honour, as Contradict my will Lor. That Don Lopez, the lately arriv'd Kinsman Of your fair ChargeâOh forgive my Jealousy? Vice. Nothing but her Friendship to Appamia. At the return of my belov'd Emilius, I hope To fix that Lady, and all her Fortunes, in my Family, Direct me heav'n, but in the Disposal of those two choice blessings Thou hast given (my Children) and what e're Probations is thought Fit beside, shall be receiv'd without a Murmer! Lor. Auspicious be the Moment, that we offer up Our Prayers! Grant me good Heav'n, my Love! I ask no more. Vic. Search, my Lorenza; find this darling Mistriss out; Fall at her Feet; and Breath thy faithful Vows: I'le follow; and my persuasions add: This kind Force Will Storm her gentle Breast; and touch that Heart, which seems Impenitrable. Lor. Oh Love! Thou charming little God, dwell in my Eyes, And hang upon my Tongue, with Honey-dropping Eloquence! Steal through her Ears; and thrill into her Heart. Till She at lash th'Almighty Rapture know: To please her self; and ease her Lover's Woe! [Exeunt. Enter Apamia and Zelide. App. Remember Zelide, each particular We'ave from Lovisa Learn't. Zel. Fear not Madam; my Memory shall be A faithful Register to serve you. App. Easie, and plain her Wordsâ An honest Freedom ran through her Narration.â And am I Doom'd to Ruine this Artless Innocence? Zel. Blest be these Reflections! Cherish these thoughts; Continue Madam, as free from Guilt As is Lovisa. App. But shall she then possess Emlius? Shall these Cursed Eyes behold the Hateful Object of their meeting Loves! See the Gay Years Circle round with flowing Pleasure? Whilst I despair! No, rather gape wipe, thou Earth And swallow them or meâto bear us all The Burden is too great! Zel. Still I am your Slave; and 'tis my fear for you; For your dear Safety only, make me wish You'd move no farther. App. Yes; I will on; and give 'em back the Wracks, I feelâSure 'tis but Justiceâ The Earl d Englesac; he was the Man, Her Father chose for whom the Nuptuals were prepar'd, Zel. Right Madam. Enter Page. Pag. The Lord Bucarius waits your Pleasure App. Admit him, yet stay, come back, Zelide Whither am I going, can I decree Emilius Death And Live? Yes; for he's Dead to me alreadyâ But can I dehold the noblest Form, Nature In all her Workings, e're produc'd; or, Joyning Art rendred Exquisite, a cold Lump Of Clay: The Immortal Soul Hunted by Violence, from her lovely Dwelling. Zel. Think well Madam; for after Death, Repentance is too late! App. What is't that Staggers my Resolvesâ Avaunt thou soft, Intruding Pity! Let my wild Fancy view their Scenes of Mutual Love; and Fire my just Revenge! Ha! Methinks I see their glowing Lips; Which thurst to meet their close Embraces; Where their beating Hearts keep time; Their Arms are Revetted together! Part 'em ye Powers; part 'em! Set Seas, Olimpick Hills And all the Lumber of the Earth between 'em!âOh! Zel. Dear Madam Cease! App. I will be Calm, as the still Waters; when scarce A Breath of Wind Curles the falling Wavesâ Husht like a sleeping Serpent underneath A Bed of Flowers.âBut when those Happy Loves think to trace the Steps of Everlasting Joy. Tempests, and Whirlwinds, Stings of Adders shall surround 'em! Now let him come Oh what Earth-quakes shake This little Frame, wou'd it were once Destroy'd Emilius, and Lovisa then Might Live in Peace. Zel. Look up my Princess disquiet be their Portion, Since they have made it yours. App. He comes my Woes must be dissembled, and my Looks be Cheerful. Enter Bucarius. âMy Lord, did you not wonder at my Summons? Buc. I was pleasingly surpriz'd; as Dying Men with a Reprive; or Tortur'd Minds with suddain Ease So Joyful, and so unexpected was the mighty Favour. App. Your repeated Services I long heve weigh'd Your continual Application, in whatever Related to my welfare; nor is your Constant Vows Of Love forgotâAnd if I seem'd to slight those Assiduities: It was but the utmost Tryal of your Faith. Buc. Oh Sounds Celestial! Words Transcendent, as Thy Charms! What can my Goddess mean? App. Leave Extasies, to a more fitting Seasonâand if You dare assist, and free me from an Usurpation Which I hate: My self, with all the vast Revenues I command, is thine, without another Article. Buc. For one kind look, I wou'd have forfeited my Life; But Brib'd so high: Methinks I shou'd do more than Dye. App. You know the Vice-roy has Long been Ruler here; And to his false Care my mistaken Father Left unhappy me. Buc. Which prov'd his Blessing. The Court of Spain Is slow in their Supplies; and when the Vice-roy First appear'd, the Island was in an Uproar; Soldiers unpaid; and therefore Mutinous; All Form of Government neglectedâHe Empty'd your full Coffers, to stop their Craving Mouths; and with the Wealth of your Great Ancestors bought a lasting Peace. App. Yet, tho' I put up this; Remit the mighty Debts, Which he can never pay: Still wou'd he Retain a Tyranny upon my Will; still Guide my Actions, and dispose of all my Fortunes. Buc. By your Injuries, and my Immortal Love, he shan'not! I'le Pistol him to Morrow, on the Castle Walk! App. And so be lost your self! For he stands High, in Popular Opinion; the thoughtless Vulgar hallow him applause, Because he's fam'd for Hospitality, surfeits their Censure Appitites, and drowns their Souls In Riot; But wou'd you be directed by an injur'd Woman, His Measures shou'd all be broke, his growing Expectations Blasted, Buc. Instruct. Command me Madam, I Listen to perform. App. This Day such Wonders has produc'd, that you'l Scarce Credit my Relation; Emilius is return'd, Emilius, whom even since my Childhood I own To have Honour'd with my Friendship, trusting It seems to that when in France he had seduc'd A Lady from her Husband brings her to me to be Protected; I Swear the Conscious Blushes almost burst My Cheeks, if I reflect on the Vile Office he did design Me; Shall I connive at their Amours, my Roof shelter Their Impious Loves, help me Bucarius, help to Curse 'em. Buc. Swift Vengeance overtake him: Emilius in Sardinia. My Emulator still in the bright Source of Glory. Disappointment Cross his Delightful purposes; Heart-rending Plagues For ever rest upon him. App. Not upon him, but the false wanton I'de punish; your Sex is by custom privileg'd to Injuries like these, your Honours scarce tainted, call a Venial Crime, but In a Wife 'tis sure unpardonable. Buc. What is it, Madam, you desire of me? App. To have this Woman in a Monastry Clapt up, or Instantly sent back to France. I'de have her Brother Told her Baseness, to have her given up to his Revenge, I know not what I'de have, for whilst she stays, the Sight of her, and of her Crimes will make me Mad. Buc. [aside.] Ha! I suspect, but I will search it throughly. Who is her Brother? App. Alas! I had forgot to tell you, this Emilius too I wish Secur'd, till She is past the power of ever seeing Him again, he is Disguis'd and may be Seiz'd on Some pretence. Buc. Explain your Intentions to me, Madam. App. The Room's too publick for our Conference, In my Closet, you shall be inform'd. Buc. And if I stop at ought that you Command, Or not Destroy whom ever you have Doom'd; May this blest Moment of your kindness Prove a Dream; and may I wake again to the Despair' in which the Dawning Day beheld me. App. That wayâI'll followâ Now Zelide, now let the Glorious Sun Withdraw his Chearful Beamsâ Darkness, and furies shou'd Assist at this Black CouncilâOh Love! Thy Golden shaft Pierc'd first this this Tender Heart, and warm'd it With a Lambent Fire: which now by Jealously, Is set into a Blaze. How I cou'd Burn, how I am lost in rage, No Gentle Shower's such Mounting Flames Asswage, Lovisa the belov'd must Mourn as well as I. I'le be reveng'd my Zelide, and I'le Dye; Can she my Rival then my Justice blame; I give her Death, and taste my self the same. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Bucarius and Roderigo, Meet. Buc. Oportunely are we met, my Faithful Roderigo, for I have Deeds in Agitation. That want a Subtil Head, a Heart resolv'd And Hand like thine to help Accomplish. Rod. Long have ye talk'd of Mischief rail'd on the Vice-roy, Breath'd nought but Grievances, and Swore redress; but whilst I find ye drag the Proud Appamia's Chains, whilest thus ye Haunt the Palace of that Disdainful, fair Glory, And Interest, tho' they call aloud' I fear will hardly Wake ye from the Lethergy of Love. Buc. If now I shake not off the Effeminate Slavery. Boys shall Proclame my Folly's, and hout me From the Society of Men; yet never till this Moment had I such Grounds to hope Possession Of Appamia her Wealth, and full Revenge on my Honours Rival, and my Love the Curst Emilius. Rod. I cannot reach ye. Buc. All shall be Unravell'd, there's secret Marriges. My Instrument, there's Room for Plots that shall Destroy the growing greatness of the Vice-roy's Race. Rod. Appamia Married! Buc. No; She wou'd have been, my friend was first In Love which sure's the greatest Curse, and Shame Of Woman-kind. Emelius the Object of her Fancy, Who having baulk'd her Eager Wishes she meditates. Revenge on his fair Choice, and I am to be the Fool Employ'd. Rod. How found you this? Buc. Her every word and look inform'd me, but having Wrung each useful Circumstance from her Distracted fury, I'le Counter-plot her purposes And sure Destruction shall o'retake 'em all. Come with me, and I'le unfold what I design, Disguises must be had, much thought, and Caution Us'd, ha! She follows, and in htr Face the Stamp of Heav'n wears, but I know her Soul deceitful, And will not trust my Eyes to Gaze. Enter Appamia and Zelide. App. Not gone, my Lord, who have you there? Buc. One that will Assist in your Commands. App. Be Expeditious, and be careful, If the Reward Inspires ye. Buc. The Task's too easieâI would have play'd With Danger; for such a glorious Prize, Courted Hazards; where Life hung by a Hair: And whatso're is fancied Dreadful had oppos'd me! App. Zelide shall still inform ye, how we moveâ Industrious, and Faithful is the Indian Slaveâ In her you may relyâHaste, Noble Sir, as I have DirectedâLet your first business be to keep Emilius from returning Instantly. Buc. He moves this Day as I contrive, and you Appoint, to Morrow is his own farewell; Remember Princess what you have promis'd, [Exeunt. Zel. Can then Spain's Beauty, Nay I may add The world's, receive this Rough General, For her Lord, the Son of Fortune, only whose Sword is his Inheritance, whilst Princes, Lords of Provinces Sigh to be her Slaves. App. That's a Thought the least disturbs meâ No Zelide, we shall never live to be his Bride. Zel. How Madam! App. Dye before; and so discharge our promiseâ Harke thee, Zelide, thou art skill'd in Baleful Drugs, the greatest Foes to Humane kindâ One deadly drop by thee prepar'd, and mingl'd With the stream of Life (the Blood) will Spoil The Noblest Frame of Nature, Poyson each Azure Channel; let down the useful Springs, Stop the beating Pulses, and all the curious Movements Till the Machine Drops into it's Original Clay, To be reviv'd no more. Zel. Oh Princess! Merciful Heav'n keep you, From thoughts like these! App. Why dost tremble? you said you were a Princess Born; and that thy Swarthy Veins Carry'd the Royal Blood of those, who heretofore, Were Lords of Mexico! It must be false; Thou hast a Plebian Soul; else, thou hadst Us'd that skill, which I Implore: and died, E're been my Slave. Zel. It was your gentle Usuage which reconcil'd me first To Life; and then to the Love of you: Which if I have fail'd inâ App. No; thou hast not; nor you shan'notâ If you refuse me: with this drawn Dagger I'le give my Rival present DeathâThen Our Laws will Doom me to severest Wracks, And publick Shame upon a Scaffold End me. Zel. Oh my Lov'd Mistriss! App. Why is it such a pain to Live, and sin to Dye If Bucarius fails, Lovisa's not remov'd, and Then this Night they meet, and long succeeding Joyful Days and Nights attend 'em, prepare My Slave a Draught, prepare for her, or me Both caenot must not Live. Zel. Have peace, you shall be obey'd. App. I thank thee, faithful Creature, now to the Alcove leadâI must Tinge Lovisa's Sweets; If her mind is undisturb'd, I am but half Reveng'dâShe must be Rouz'd; Alarm'd with Doubts, and Fears set her Desponding Heart in Tortures like to mineâCreate her Woes, May Equal my Despair. [Exeunt. SCENE Drawn. Lovisa Sleeping on a Couch. Enter Appamia, and Zelsde. App. There wrapt in Innocence, and Peace She lies, No Dreadful Dreams, warn her of approaching Fate, Calm Sleep, Cordial to the Wretched, for ever Fled from me seems fond to eang upon those Beauteous Lids, Baths and Wanton's in her Eyes, and Revels on her Lips in Charming Smiles Zel. Can you Commend, and not yet pity? App. 'Tis Emilius no doubt, is the pleasing Image Of her DreamsâShe sees him at her Feet Hears his soft Vows, and Darts him back Ten Thousand Joysâ Zel. Madam, She Wakes! Lov. What gone agen; ye Airy Fantam! Why have ye forsook me? Why are my longing Eye-lids stretch'd in vain, for him, whom Sleeping I beheld! App. I told ye soâForgive my over-careâ Such Charge Emilius gave; such Charms Have you: That much I Covet to be near you. Lov. This is Excess of Noble Charity to a poor Stranger; and your humble Handmaidâ But is there yet no news from my Dear Lord? App. NoneâI doubt my fair Friend, you'l be Too fond; expect more: Complaisance, More Kinnness, than our Spanish Nobles Pay to Wives. Lov. To Wives! Why Madam, is there a Dearer Name? App. Bless me! Nurtur'd in the Court of Frauce, and Ask That QuestionâI thought your Gallantry had been Our ExampleâI assure ye, there's scarce a Man Of Quality here, but wou'd think himself despis'd, Deform'd, or most abominably Scandaliz'd, If publick Fame took no notice that he had A MistressâAt all our old Customary Feasts, There's not a Don, tho' Marry'd to the Charming'st Bride, On Earth, but wears some other Lady's Colours; Leaving his Wife so to be Honour'd by her Hero, If she has any: But by the Husband She's Certainly neglected. Lov. Oh my Emilius! How far art thou from Once resembling such a Waverer! App. I'm glad to hear itâFrance has strangely Alter'd him! In this Court he was the very Minion of the Ladies Addrest to all each blooming Beauty Shar'd his Heart, tho' none possest it wholly With an Air of Universal Kindness apply'd to All; But these were the Triffling Hours of Youth: Now He seems fix'd indeed. Lov. The Character is so indifferent from the Brave Emilius, that were it not for strongest Proofs: I shou'd think you did not know the Man. App. Oh! He's a Dissembler; take my word for't, But he may make the better Husband. Lov. If I could think, the Lord, my Heart has Chose, For whom I have forsook all that the World Calls Comforts, thus Inclin'd: I'de Dye to Rid me of the Dismal Apprehensions,â Oh Madam! Forgive me, if I say 'tis unkind! App. What? Lov. To tell me thisâIf it be true, I'me undone! Think on my ConditionâSuppose you had left This Delightful Palace; the Place where you are Known, and Honor'd; fled with some Dear Man, To Distant ClimesâConsider, how t'would shock ye, But to fear this trusted only Friend shou'd prove Unconstant, Faithless, as the Seas you Past! Such Is my Fate, if he forsakes me, for whom Iv'e All forsakenâDespair, and Death's my Portion! Oh Emilius! Cruel! Unkind! Return, and Chear me, e're it be too late! App. Accuse him not; nor grieve at what's deliver'd As a Friendly CautionâBut why doth he Loiter now? He said he would not see the Vice-roy; and tho' he hold His Sister, near his Heart: Methinks, if he fulfill'd His parting Words, his Visit shou'd be shorter. Lov. I know not what to thinkâMy Soul so long Has held him true; with such a Faith Believ'd his Promises: that it will be wondrous hard To Judge him False; but harder much to find him so. App. Be wise, and you are happyâAll yet is in your Power, Untasted Sweets; Virgins Favours; Beauty, like yours Wou'd Urge the greatest Rambler to play the Saint, With Perjur'd Breath; kindle such lovely Fires, and Venture his Immortal Hopes, for your Embracesâ I say not this of our EmiliusâBut such Men there are. Lov. Oh! App. When next you see him; which must be suddainly, if His Friends have sway'd him, or Adellaida, by The Description of some fam'd Beauty in her prime, Renew'd his old Amours: You'l find it in his Alter'd Carriage; he'l be reserv'd, disturb'd, Spite of Dissembled Fondnessâmark him Nicely, and you may discoverâ Lov. Oh all ye Powers! is this my Task! must My plain honest Heart, that's full of Love, Of Faith, and true Obedience, be wrack'd with Jealous Pangs; still on the Watch, to find out the Tricks, and Turnings of Deceitful Men: No, rather Than endure, the Killing Pain; the little abject Office: I'le rip it up; and led out Love, and Life together. App. No, my Lovisa (give me leave to call you mine) We will live in highest Pleasure; Live, if you can, Learn like me, to Despair, and slight the Betraying Race I, who have seen 'em Cringing at my Feet; been Surrounded with eager Eyes, and bended Knees, Stopt my Ears at the bewitching Charmersâ The false Guilding of their Love wou'd not down With meâI saw Interest Lurking underneath: And scap'd Destruction. Lov. Alas! What have you scap'd? You are yet within the Very bloom of Beauty; Love has not yet sent the Hero He designs your Conquerour; had you met with one Like my Emilius, graceful in his Person; by Nature fram'd to be the Darling Joy of Woman-kind; Who, when he tells the Story of his Love, wou'd make The Coldest Virgin's Bosome Heave; her Heart to Pant: And Eyes run o're, as mine do now! App. [aside.] Oh scalding Drops; they set my Heart on Fire. Lov. But when he sees the listning Maid Incline To the soft passion, his Sighs Inspire: How his Eyes Will talk; how he will tremble; How Infect With the Convulsive Joy! How Swear! How Weep! Oh 'tis too much for Words, 'tis Rapture all! App. [aside.] Torture, worse than Death! Vengeance! Before my Face She noth possess him! She dies, my Zelide, by all my Wrongs She dies. Lov. And did I believe all this, Innocent and Credulous; The Eager Transports of a first Amour: the Noble Vows of Simpathising Souls, which God-like, and untainted Truth possest: Did I Forego my Awful Duty, loose the Dear Blessings Of my Indulgent Parents, fly from my Tender Mother, whose Arms Nurs'd my Infant Weakness Up to this Ingratitude, whose kind Eyes never View'd me but with Smiling pleasureâwhich Now perhaps, are Streaming for my Fault; Or Closing with Pangs, greater than those I gave her at my Ill-fated Birth! Zel. Oh! who can here words like these, and keep their Temper! not Conquer'd India, Groaning under Her Tyrannic-Masters, shows a greater Wretch! App. Madam! what mean your most immoderate Griefs Upon a bare SuggestionâFie, Fie! 'Tis most unreasonable! Lov. Your PardonâFor I must have leave to Rave, Can I but think of sharing my Emilius's Love, or Loosing the Idea, my Soul had Fram'd of Deathless Constancy; of endless Kindness; can my working Fancy behold this dismal wrack of all my Quiet, And not run Mad! App. Mad! For what? Oh, were but as free from Love as I! Banish the thought that wou'd disturb ye! Love. Never, Never; till I'm Convinc'd, my Fears are Vain! App. âZelide, Prepare the Banquet, I commandedâlet the Italian Eunuch Sing; and softest Musick turn her Griefs, Till this Prince beloved, this dearest Man return: And bring Peace, and Comfort to her mind. Lov. Oh Heavn's! Banquets, and Musick! am I Fit for either! App. Unkind is your Refusal of what my Care provided. Love. I must Obey; with all these Swelling Griefs I consent To your desires, because you say 'tis kindly meant. So Wretches, who despair, when Death's in View; Do Pleasures Taste; and seem delighted too. Feign'd Smiles conceal the faltering Smart; Gay in their Looks: whilst Tempests rend the Heart [Exit Scene Draws. Discovers Brisac, and Adellaida, sitting on a Couch A SONG. After the SONG. Bris. Crown'd with dear Consenting Love, Listening To the Musick of thy Voice willingly wou'd I Forget the busie World; with thee Supinely pass My Softer Hours on this Lov'd Bosome Wrack'd With delight, confess the bliss, my Adellaida, Created with Golden Slumbers Charm'd and Waking still to bless the Beauteous Cause, Crown'd With Happy Days, and Happier Nights, which Feasted every Sense with Love, and still renew'd Desires, that will never, never Fade. Adel. If, my Brisac, one Corner of the Globe were yours, Or mine, I think we might Command a Lasting Happiness: But when both, tho' born To wealth, and Noblest Honours, are dependant on a Rigid Parents Will: what shall we hope, But lasting Woe? Bris. Rather Eternal Joy! Is this the Language, Hymen Requires, upon our Nuptial Day? No, No. Kisses, Embraces are his DueâWords soft as as thy Frame; and Looks that Melt in kindly Shower's. Amid. Madam, the Lord Lorenza comes this way! Adel. Ha! My Fathers Favourite! Call my Women! Oh my Brisac! how awkard is the Sound of Love Pronounc'd by those we hateâNot but that Lorenza's Nicely brave; and Justly Qualifi'd For his inherent GreatnessâBut if there be A Fate below: Sure 'tis shown in that Which Guides Affection. Enter Lorenza. Lor. Thro' all the Rooms of State, and Antichambers Have I pass'd: where the Dumb Gazers In Expectation stand, like Statutes, or the Sensless Pictures over 'em. No Life is seen In Court, whilst you Fair Princess Retire To Recesses, that are forbidden the Admiring World. Adel. Methinks the Vice-roy's side is proper'st For the Gallant Man; where in this Iron Age He will not fail to hear of Seiges, Battles, And all the Glorious business of the Brave. Lor. Yet there's a Lord, like me, seems to build His Hapiness in Beauty. Bris. Does that Displease ye? Lor. Don Lopez, I shall find a place and time To tell you whether it does, or no. Bris. Soon as you willâI'm ready. Adel. [aside.] Oh my poor heart!âMy Lords! Chose ye my Apartments for your Broils? Hence I Command ye bothâyou Don Lopez, Return Apamia Word, I'le wait upon herâ And for you, my Lord, I shou'd be glad to know What business brought you hither? Lor. Oh Words, and Looks cold enough to Confirm Despair. âBut my Happy Rival shall not Triumph (for such I know he is) here will I be reveng'd, or Fall! Turn thou Invader of all the Joys, my Youth Had promis'd; for, upon this spot of Earth Will I dispute for Adellaida: tho' her Presence Make the Chamber Sacred! Bris. Here woud'st thou Fight for Adellaida, To have the Womens Cries Alarm all the Palace: Be parted, 'ere my Arm cou'd reach theeâBoy. Lor. Thou art a secret undermining Traytor. Bris. Ha! Adel. Don Lopez, my Lord have I no power? I charge thee go; or else plunge both your Swords into my Bosomeâgo I charge yeâ And leave me with Lorenza! Bris. Farewel! The time was most unfit: And I repent my rashness. [Exit. Adel. So, My Lord was this well done! Lor. Oh Madam! ask the Mad-man a Reason For his last Extravagance! Ask Sinners In Dispair, why they Curse Heav'n, when They shou'd Pray? Your Beauteous Eyes Have ruin'd me! they have darted Fires, Which tho' they set me in Extramest Burnings: Yet the reflected Heat warms not the smallest Particle of you! Adel. Lorenza; tell me freely, is it your self You Love, or me? Lor. Oh Cruel Question! Command one Hand To Cut the other off; Take this WeaponâStab me o're, and or'e with Wounds tho' but in wanton Sport of Tyranny, See if I'de Complain! Adel. If this be true, if you cou'd suffer this, sure you Can suffer less; and for a Gift so Noble, as My everlasting Friendship, bear the Wrack Of disappointed Love. Lor. I guess your meaningâhow quick it runs Thro' my Distracted Brain! 'tis got alrendy To my Heart, and pulls the Bursting Stringsâ Your Father comesâBut, Oh! I find no Advocate will do! Adel. Stop him Lorenza. Divert his Wrath, for much I fear, He Has heard of this disorder: Perform my first Desires; and let me be oblig'd. Lor. Tho' Death is mingled with these sweet Words, And surely will follow: yet much I'm pleas'd to hear 'em. Adel. No; you shall Live renown'd, and long; if my Prayers prevail: But meet my Father, and appease him. Lor. Will you forgive me then this Roughness; this most Unmanly Violence, my passion Caus'd? Adel. I will. Lor. But will you ever see me more? Adel. Yes; Instantly: and tell you all my Fate. Lor. Oh thanks; tho' 'tis my undoing, whilst I hear You speak: I shall dye Contented. [Exit. Adel. This young Noble-man, is Honest Just, and Brave; I must Confide in him; else his Love will Set him full at my Brisac; or draw my Father's Hatred on my Husband. What a Name is that! How much is he Dearer Than all Mankind! If I forget my Duty Forgive me Heav'n. 'Tis Love Nature's first, and great decree Preserver of the World and Conquerer of me. [Exit. Enter Bucarius. Buc. So, this Disguise will do; Appamia doubtly Arm'd for our Destruction, Resistless Beauty Dwells in her CÅlestial Form, but Oh! Hell has Been at Work within; There Subtilty, Revenge, And violent Passions Reign, yet she shall be O're reach'd and yield to my Embraces; or Bear the Odium of the Bloody Crime which I'le Contrive; Heist Roderigo. Enter Roderigo. Rod. The same. Buc. Well! How, and How. Rod. Exactly as your heart desiresâEmilius passing From the Palace back to Appamia was seiz'd, His name demanded, which he denying, was, a Spy clapt up; And there Remains, till you think fit I shou'd release him: And as you Order'd, give the Paper. Buc. Within an Hour let it be doneâComes Don Lopez, as I directed? Rod. He follows; I told him a Stranger waited For him, in this private Grove. Buc. Excellent! away, be careful Roderigo, since Ruine, or Glory, waits such bold Attemptsâ FlyâI hear him.â [Exit Rod. Enter Brisac. Bris. By my full hopes of dear expected Bliss, This Quarrel most Ominous. If 'Tis Lorenza waits me here, shou'd Death Or Conquest be my Fate; What Troubles Must I heap on thee, my poor kind Adellaida! Ha! Who have we here!âWou'd you, Sir, ought with me? Buc. If you are the Count Brisac.â Bris. Brisac! How came you by that Name? Buc. My Eyes Inform me you are the the Man. Bris. Trust me Friend, I cannot recollect where They Learn that Knowledge; for till this Moment, surely mine did ne're Encounter 'em. Buc. Yes; often: Tho' not heedfully, my time indeed was spent From Court, where, you resided, but my Noble Injur'd FriendâI'me sure, you'l ownâ Brisac. What Friend? Lead me out of this amaze! Buc. The Earl of d Anglesack. Bris. And what of him? Buc. Have you not a Sister tooâLovisa Nam'd? Bris. Yes. Pleasing is the Remembrance; her Beauty And her Fame stood fair, when I left France; I dare Answer for her, She has not lost the Virtuous Character. Buc. Beauty, indeed, she still retainsâBut, Oh!â The more Inestimable Jem, Bright Honorâ! Which sullied once, or lost, like the flying Hours, Can never, never be retriev'd! Bris. Whither do thy Speeches lead; for I am yet i'th' Dark? Buc. Observe, that Earl I mention'd, Espous'd your Sister Bris. I do believe it; for my Father writ, 'twas so Design'd, Buc. Oh fatal Nuptials! Oh unhappy Marriage Wretch'd d' Englesack! Oh my dearest Friend! Bris. What mean these Exclamations! Who Has wrong'd your Friend, and mine? Buc. Lovisa. Bris. No. Buc. If deserting his Bed, and him, when scarse the Hymenial Tapers were burnt out, e're the Fresh Beauties of the Spring, by Virgins strow'd, Were wither'd: If this base: Then basely Has Lovisa done. Bris. With whom? Or what: Or how? Let me By degrees, to a just Fury rise! Buc. Of him she has blindly chose, I can give But small AccountâSome Idle Debauchee, Who caught her with a Foppish Face; A Guady Coat; such a despicable Triffle.â Bris. Patience, ye boiling Viens! Back to your Fountains; and carry cooling Patience!â Where are these Adulterers? Speak, thou Upstart Fiend; send to Wrack my quiet! Buc. Behold this wound, given by the Villain who is In Sardinia hidâI have track'd him hither, Your Father, and the Earl, come on; but Spite Of this disabl'd Arm, I'le make Vengeance sure, E're the dishonor's blaz'd abroad. Bris. Thou make Vengeance sure! Thou prevent the Dishonour of my Family! By Hell, I shall Believe all that thou hast said a Curst invented Lye: Unless you show me Lovisa in Sardinia. Buc. I'le do't; if you'l Engage to keep your temper; And after bring you, where I am to meet the Traytor. I knew not of your being here: nor when I saw you, had I made an Application, but that My over-eager Zeal for poor d' Englesack threw me on, On his Honors Ravisher just at our Landing, Where the Ships Crew, prompted by the Triumphant Villain, whom I suppose a Native here disarm'd And broke my Limbs. Bris. Prodigious! All Monstrous, and uninteligible! Buc. I am sorry I can with so much Ease convince ye Who wou'd serve a Friend so earnestly, and be Thus suspected it was my violent Friendship Made me out-do their Search, and find away to pass In the same Ship, with the false Fugitives; tho' 'twas Too late to stop 'emâFollow me, I will Inform you Of every little Circumstance; and to Confirm 'em true. Show you Lovisa in the wanton Reveller's Arms. Bris. Do this, and be for everâ Buc. What? Bris. Curst, as I am now! From all the Downy Sweets, I long for, thus remov'd From all that's Lovely; all that is belov'd. From Love Natures Feast her sublimest Joy From Raptures, that wou'd almost Life destroy, Rouz'd by the call of Honor, Injur'd Fame My Love I hazard to preserve my Name, Quit the Dearest Wife to hide a Sisters Shame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Appamia, meeting Zelide. App. Hast thou seen Bucarius Zel. I have. App. And moves the Engine right? Zel. As Mischiefs self were the Contriver,â Emilius is freed; and by a Letter charg'd with Villany, a Feign Challenge sent him, to defend his Honor, Threatn'd with Cowardize: If he devulge or Forbear the meeting. App. An early Courage, and undaunted Mind his forward Youth has still discover'd: His Manly Arm Pluckt fair Fame from Danger's ugliest Mouth; And in our Annals made long Tracts of brightness. Zel. Gloomy, and sad this way he walks; now revolving Deeply in his troubl'd Breast, this unexpected Charge Of Fate; then starting, as from a Dream of Horror, And Crying out Lovisa! App. Aye; that's the Thought that tears him; not For himself, but her, he fearsâFool, Fool! Be still; or to Elysium go, and meet her there! On Earth I stand the Flaming Barr between That ye shall never clasp with Joyâ Zel. The Lord Bucarius hither trains Brisca, by ways. To him unknown, where he shall see Emilius, and Lovisa behold their meeting Joys, and Confirm the Dishonor he suspects; next the pretended Challenge Draws Emilius back, and leaves Lovisa to yours And to her Brother's Rage. App. My Fancy hurry's on to wild Confusions I dare Not trust Brisac's resentment, they may talk, and All be well; is the fatal Cordial ready. Zel. The Poison is. App. But may we trust Bucarius in his Contrivance Of a Challenge, I know Emilius eager to Answer His Accuser, Suppose the General prove a real Foe My Rage shrinks back at thought of my Emilius, I cannot bear that he should be destroy'd, my Injuries Mount high, but Love Soars higher yet, and will Preserve him. Zel. Bucarius I dare dromise will not exceed your Commands, least he forfeit what he so lately gain'd, Your Favour. App. Emilius comes, hast, give Lovisa Notice why Dost thou flutter thus my Injur'd Heart, why Steals the Woman's weakness into my Eyes at his Lov'd sight, here will I wait unseen, and view their Fondness to Steel my Soul from all remorse. [Exit. Enter Emilius, With a Paper in his Hand. Emil. Call'd, Villain; Coward! Seiz'd Challeng'd in my Father's Court! And yet By Honor, and by Love compell'd not to Discover who I am. (for that wou'd give this Blaster of my Fame just Cause for his black Calumnies.) But Oh! Lovisa! To whom shall I commit her? How hide These dark Perplexities! Which shou'd the Trembling Dear once know: 'Twou'd Fright her Peace away; and Break her tender Heart. Enter Lovisa and Zelide. Lov. See where he Stands; Squandering the precious Minuts; which I with eager Expectation CountedâPains in my Heart, and in My Eyes, incessant Tears. Zel. Some Grief has seiz'd him; but sure your Sight Will hush his CaresâI'll to my Princess; And inform her of his coming. Lov. My Lord! Emil. My Love! My Life! Lov. Am I well us'd? Emil. Are ye not my Dearest! Lov. No! Emil. By whom? Lov. By thee, Emilius; thou much Lov'd false One! Emil. Ha! Lov. Is this your promis'd hast? Are these thy Joys Sardina Yields? Cou'd you not add a Day to your Dissembled Truth! Must I be tortur'd instantly? Yes, yes I must! For I deserve it all; from Heav'n I merit more: But not (Oh cruel Man) not from thee! Emil. My Angel! Thy upbradings are unjustâ Were there no Cause for my delay: Methinks Lovisa might have chid me less Severelyâ But, Oh! Believe Emilius, who never will Deceive thee, there was a Cause! Lov. That Cause I'de know. If I am Lov'd, I may be trustedâThe Letter, which, at sight Of me, so hastily you hidâLet me see it; Ease the wracking Fears, that from my Heart and Eyes draw painful ShowersâFor I too think, I Have a Cause, much Cause, to suspect thy Faith. Emil. What Villain, equal Enemy to Truth, and me, Has dar'd Traduce my Honor? Lov. Give me the Letter; and I'le confront the Accuser With the falshood you stand Charg'd. Emil. How poor is your Request! Command My Life; and try your Power! Lov. If desiring so small a thing I am deny'd: What future hope can raise me from Despair! Oh Emilius! Thy words have lost their Accent! And thy looks their Tenderness! Something sadly Whispers to my Soul, I am undone!â For ever, ever Ruin'd! Emil. Sure Fate has watch'd her time, for my Destruction! And with a smiling Face, led me on to happy Moments; Which I expecting doubly Fraught with Joys: Now turn the Curst Reverse, and leave no Grasping Hold! Lov. I am that Fate you fear; the Bar to some New Beauty, or Wealthier AimâBut Oh! My Lord! If there remains one Spark Of Honor, bestow me in a Cloyster; amidst secluded Virgins I'le remain; nor murmur your unkindnessâ Do this; if you are not lost to all Humanityâ Let the Holy Veil shrow'd me, from the vile Scorns Of your ungrateful Sex! Emil. O here am I! Who is it talks thus to me! It is Lovisa! My Wife! Dearer thrn These Eyes! Dearer than my strugling Heart! Which never trembled, but at thy Anger! Dearer than every Tye, or Bond, which Nature makes! By her am I Condemn'd; by her thus hardly us'd, Take notice thou Stranger, Enemy; whatsoe're Thou artâAll thy approbrious Names I here Forgive Thee; since she, my Bosom'd Soul, who Like my Conscience, knows each Action of my Life: Since she Taxes me with loss of HonorâOh!

Forgive my Inconsiderate Words; and take me to your Arms; whilst Mine are fill'd with Pleasures; leaning on your Breast, And Listening to your Sighs; let me forget my Sorrows; And if it is Deceit: 'Tis also Delight ineffable, To be so deceiv'd!

Thy lovely Eyes Relate their Fires! And thou agen Art lost in Contemplation! Emil. Take off Oh Lovisa, those piercing Looks; Let not those Heav'nly Lights, the Planets That must Rule my Days, this Moment Pry into my Heart: And all the Years I have to come, I'le lay it open, to thy view: Spare me some Hours, and I'le bring thee everlasting Peace! Lov. Eternal Woe! Ha! I reflect on thy past words! Thou hast an Enemy! O Idle Jealousies; where Got ye room into a Bosome that is fill'd with naught But Love! Behold me on my Knees; Hanging upon Thine, with Dying Pangs! Oh! Let it strike Compassion Through thee! Emil. Why doth thy Tenderness Torment thy self, and me; Indeed my Love, there is no Danger; nor Just Cause For thy disquietâI'le intreat our Friend to Comfort ye. Lov.

Will it give me Restâ [Drinks. Emil. I hope so dearest! App. [aside] 'Tis done, and by his Hand!âMethinks the Infernal Powers Smile; turn; turn o're their horrid Leaves Of black Revenges: And set mine down most Exquisite! Emil. How fares my only Blessing? Lov. Beyond the power of strugling longer with my Woes! Lead me Virgins, from him, and from the Light; Let Sable Curtains make an Artificial Night There will I fix, and my sad Fate deplore, Nor e're look up or aim at Comfort more. [Exeunt. Emil. She's gone! And with her Griefs has riven my Heart asunder! Oh Appamia! By the pure Fire, that kindled in our Infant Minds, and grew To Friendships holy Flame, I do Conjure thee Cherish my Lovisa; whatever rugged Fortune's mine, In Life's uncertain Lottery: Or if the Blank Prove Death; Oh!

So may The Power's shed on your Beauteous Frame Eternal Blessings; never ceasing Joy: And successive Comforts without end! App. Why this Injunction? Emil. If I return: 'twas needless: If not, Remember it my latest Prayer! Protect that Innocent Unhappy Fair: And Shield her from that ugly Fiend Despair. [Exit. App. Ye Curst Fond Foolish Eyes, that drew in Fires, yet Wanted power to dart 'em back, Stretch your Extorted Lids persue his Lovely Form, perhaps ye never May behold him more. Zelide, I prethee Drench this Dagger in thy fatal Compound that the least Enterance by it made, may carry Death speedy And inevitable. Zel. Is this at last the only Service I must do for My most Generous Mistress, to scatter destruction Round, and leave her Name Accurst. App. 'Tis past, my Zelide, we are plung'd in deep Unfathomable depths, there's no returning. The shudderrings o're Lovisa there I must sink In Blood, and loose the sense of fear. Zel. Oh for Lovisa I cou'd weep! In few hours space Such heat will boyl within her Veins; Such pains will stretch her Aking Nerves; Intolerable Burnings in her Brain; thro' every Pore Fire unquenchable force its way; Hissing in her Blood: and Flaming in her Eyes. App. And by Emilius this Cordial Draught was Administred: 'tis fit he sees his handy workâ Oh Subtil Aid of Hell; for the Contrivance was Beyond my hopeâIn such pains must She Expire, say'st thou? Zel. Oh yes! But if your Christian Faith, I have Learnt Be true; Death Ends her Misery, and mine for causing it, Bears an Eternal Date. App. Canst thou fear Hell, that look'st its Offspring?

Why was I born! Or why preserv'd to this Distracting Hour! ye Malicious Stars that knew Me form'd the hate of Adellaida? Why in my Cardle did ye Forbear to shed your poisonous Fires, and blast my Thoughtless Childhood: E're I knew such pangs as these! Adel. Call it not hate, Lorenza, when I profess an Esteem particular; which every day increases, And grows to an Admiration of your Noble Qualities. Lor. But never will produce the least spark of LoveâSay Madam Is it not so? Do I not speak your thoughts? Adel. Suppose you came too late: turn'd Beggar, when I Was Bankrupt grown; your worthy Heart is not To be Trifled with: therefore I deal without Reserve Lor. Executions tho' delay'd, or given Instantly Bear equal Terror! Adel. That you, My Lord, already have my Father's Voice, Is Granted; Nay, that Minutely I expect his Dread Commands, Most true: but that they cannot be by me Obey'd, is also a sad Truth; which you must hear! Lor. Hold, 'e're ye pronounce my Fate!âwhat! never Adellaida? no continu'd Services? not Reiterated Prayers? no Expence of Blood? will nothing, Nothing move thee? Oh Inexorable! Adel. Had I not thought you the Noblest of Mankind I had not Dar'd thus far; For my Petition isâ Lor. I Guess it Madamâwhat ails my heart to heave! But go onâall will be Calm. Adel. Ha! Lorenza! Thy Face grows Pale I wou'd have ask'd thee, to have told the Vice-roy Thy desires were Chang'dâBut Oh! I find Thee fix'd, to both our Ruins! Lor. What does my Rival fear my Sword? Or does he Scorn me? Or is it height of Pride or Cruelty To send me Death, this Torturing way? Adel. Wrong not the Innocent; 'tis I alone wou'd tempt thee To a Generous Act; to do a Deed, will set the Foremost in Heroick Lovers Fame; to quit thy Passion, but to save thy Mistressâfor Oh! if you Persist, you may heap my Father's wrath upon me; Yes, you may cause my Death: My Love ye cannot Cause! Lor. O Severity!âBut I'le Complain no moreâIf I am Thy distin'd Victim, 'tis he, the happy he, shall Send me thro' my Wrack'd Heart; force his Triumphant Way, with hands steep'd in my Gore, (a sight will Please those Cruel Eyes) Grasp the Bliss: for which, Whilst I have Breath, I shall be wishing! (is going) Adel. Hold, Lorenza, against whom dost thou Arm? Lor. Needs that Question? Don Lopez, my Curst Supplanter! Adel. Stay thee a Moment; and knowâThat Noble Youth's my HusbandâIf after this knowledge, thou Dar'st to lift thy Impious Hands against him; If thou dost Wound him (For Chance of't Rules the Brave:) Blasted be my hopes for ever, when I not double all those Wounds Upon my Bosome! If I not neglect my latest Prayer; And in Cursing thee, forsake the hated World! Lor. Oh wretched State!âBe still, my Raging Heart, be still! Bound no more in boyling Blood! I'le ope the Sluce; and give thee Easeâ Turn, Adellaida, swift as thy Wishes! See where Thy Fury fallsâI have Reveng'd thee of thy detested Foe! Adel. O desparate Man! Now thou hast Ruin'd me [Stabs himself. IndeedâSome help there! Lor. All help is vain; when Despair, like mine, gives The Blow! There needs no second Aimâsayâ Won't thou Curse me now? Adel. Oh! I must Curse my self for ever! Why, Amidia; Dost thou stand agast? Start from thy sad amaze; And fill the Palace with thy Cries. Amid. Help here! help! [Exit. Adal. Lorenzo! thou rash unfortunate! What hast thou done? Lor. Ha! Can my Streaming Wound force a relenting Tear? Yes, yes, it does: Let not the Precious Balm Drop too near my Heart: Lest I Revive; And agen Torment thee! Adel. Oh! I wou'd waste in never ceasing showers, To save thy Noble Life. Lor. Is't possible? Lend me thy Hand; nor shall your Too, too happy Husband feel a Jealous pangâ The Kisses I shall leave upon it, are Damp'd With the Cold Dew of Death. Enter Vice-roy, Attended. Vice. Whither does this dolefull Sound Conduct me? Adel. Behold the Blasting Sight! Vice. Ha! Lorenza Dying! who has done this Cursed Deed? Lor. I, my self. Farewel my Fatherâ Oh Adellaida, Farewel. (Dies.) Vice. My Son! My Darling Expecttation for ever gone! âAh Trait'riss! Ah Ingrate! well mayst Thou Weep: This was thy Work. Adel. Oh Sir! Vice, 'Tis past excuse, or Pardon! has my Indulgence caus'd This Disobedience? Curst then be former Fondness; I shall No more behold thee, but with a Loathing Eye. Adel. Fatal Sounds! Drive not your once Lov'd Daughter To Distraction. Vice. Where lernt ye boldness to contemn my Choice? Confusion Light upon your Awkard Sex! Give ye your Will; Your Headstrong Will, and you'l lead your selves into perdition. Adel. Kneeling I implore your MercyâO pity and forgive Your Wretched Offspring, with dear Paternal Blessings Raise me; Or I shall sink beneath your dreadful Anger! Vice. Pity and Pardon! when I behold the blooming Hopes Of Spain Level'd by thy base Pride, below the meanest Slave! Deny'd the Sacred Funeral Rites! Rak'd up in Vile Unhallow'd Clay! Oh sad Remembrance! 'Tis For some Minion this Brave Young Man was Sacrific'dâ But hide him I Charge thee, hide him from thy Injur'd Father, or by my Just Resentment, He shall be Years a Dying. I'le have his Eyes pull'd out, His Flesh by Burning Pincers torn; and when he Roars, In heat of Torment, Scalding Oyl shall be the Draughts Administer'd, and Add to his Hellish Pains. Adel. See Sir, See; how you drag me on the Earth! Send, Send me to Lorenza; but use such killing Words no more Vice. If, he scape my Vengeance, may the sure hand of Fate. O'retake him! when with Fond Eager Eyes, Thou steals to the Banquet of ungracious Love; May'st thou View him the Destruction of thy Hopes, Pale, Bleeding, and Dead; as is Lorenza. Adel. Kneel Amida, kneel, prostrate lye on the Ground Bathing with me his Feet, And lifting up thy Hands, to move him. Vice. This Murder's thine, False Girl! Seek Heav'n, With Patience, and Prayer, Cry out aloud for Mercy there; Which (Oh!) I fear will now be hard to find! [Exit. Ami. Rise Madam, I beg ye Rise, These Wounding Griefs Consume ye. Adel. Ah Cruel Father! ther's something whispers to my heart I shall have Peace, in spite of all this Drowning Tempestâ Yet I will Rouze a little, and warm my most unhappy Love, My Dear Unfortunate Brisac: Conjure him Fly This Fatal Isle! And safety in some humble Harbour find. For sure no Star Reigns here, to Lovers kind! [Exit.</field>

Still to Alarm me with New Mischiefs! Can the time, Measur'd by so few Hours, Produce these various Scenes of Horror? Is it Don Lopez, o're whom my Daughter Weeps? Amid. Not Don Lopez, but a Nobleman of France, Who in the late Progress, gain'd the Heart, and Since the Nuptial Vows of my unhappy Mistress! Emil. Oh Sir! Your Son, your wretched Son has done All thisâCommit me to the hardest Laws, My Just Country DecreesâBut Oh!

I will, I will! [Exit forced off. Vice. What have I done, Alonza; to deserve Such Punishments? Henceforth never Let Man build, in Earth his Happiness; Since even our Children, whom we from Heav'n are priviledg'd to Love, prove our greatest Torments! To the Hall of Justice let this Dead Lord be born; and Summon thither the Alcade, and all the OfficersâOh Emilius! How shall I behold thee now a Criminal to Heav'n, and me! But I won't Chide thee Lest thou shoulst suffer; and thy Father's words Prove the sad Presages of ensuing Fate. Emil.
