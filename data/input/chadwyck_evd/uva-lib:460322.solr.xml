      <field name="fulltext">? Faciunt hi plura, sed illos Defendit Numerus, junctæque umbone Phalanges. Juv.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To My LORD, The Marquiss of Normanby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Mr. Higgons on his PLAY, call'd, THE Generous Conquerour. Could I my Voice by thy Example raise, Or as I love thy Vertues, sing thy Praise; My Muse for ever should record thy Name, Assert thy Merit, and confirm thy Fame: Methinks I see Great Dryden's Sacred Shade Direct thy Pen, thy manly Genius Aid, Dryden the Glory of our British Isles, That mighty Bard, with Secret Pleasure smiles; The mighty Bard, with Pleasure Smiles to see, The Transmigration of his Soul to thee; Griev'd that he can't this weary Life renew, And pay the Tribute to thy Merit due; Some Noble Thought in finer Phrase to dress, And what I can but think of Thee, express. If Unity of Action, Time and place Observ'd with care give Harmony, and Grace; If Numbers, if Idea's Just, and Bright, And Nature thro' the whole still kept in sight, If Vice Opprest, and Innocence preserv'd, If Vertue crown'd, have due Applause deserv'd, Be thou secure: For what Thou now hast writ, Needs not the common Aid of others Wit; Supported by the Worth, the Coin will pass Thro' the intrinsick Value of the Mass; For the impression of a Royal Mould May Grace, but cannot dignifie the Gold, But Grieve not Thou, nor think it worth defence That conscious Faction would pervert thy Sense, For 'tis a True and Long experienc'd Rule, That Vertue shocks the Knave, and Sense the Fool. Then let not this, my Friend, thy Muse Engage To lash the Vices of a hardned Age, Below thy Satyr, and not worth thy Rage; Do what thou can'st still Malespines will be, And every Malespine, a Foe to Thee. Henry Grahme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Author of the Incomparable GENEROUS CONQUEROUR. Thou more than Poet! what obscure Retreat, What happy Shade has been thy Muse's Seat? From whence, unknown so wonderful you rise, And like a New-discover'd Star surprize? How could so long those Sacred Fires supprest, Be lock'd in thine, which now fill every Breast; Thy first Essay has entertain'd us more, Than all the Muses finish'd Toils before; To thee, the Ancients would their Bays have given, And Dryden envy'd, were he not in Heav'n; With what Attention the suspended Pit, Nor with less Magick Charms the Boxes sit? Ev'n they who pre-possess'd with Hatred came, Find no Disgust, but that they cannot blame; And while thy Scenes more Generous Passions raise, Forget their Malice, and consent to Praise. Thus thy own Orpheus Generous Conquerour Act III. Scene III. with his Voice Divine, Whose Numbers only are excell'd by Thine, With equal Power, could equal Wonders shew, His charming Lyre could Savage Beasts subdue, And such are they who could thy Name pursue. M. P.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, By the Honourable Mr. Granville. Your Comick Writer, is a Common Foe, None can intrigue in Peace, or be a Beau, Nor wanton Wife, nor Widow can be sped, Not even Russell, can interr the Dead, But strait this Censor, in his Whim of Wit, Strips, and presents you naked to the Pit. Thus Criticks, should like these, be branded Foes, Who for the Poyson only, suck the Rose, Rejecting what is sweet, like Vultures, they Feed only, on the Carrion of the Play, Snarling and Carping, without Wit or Sense, Impeach Mistakes, o'er-looking Excellence: As if to every Fop it might belong, Like Senators, to censure Right or Wrong. But generous Wits, have more Heroick Views, And Love and Honour, are the Theams they chuse. To the Ladies. From yon bright Heaven, our Author fetcht his Fire, And paints the Passions, that your Eyes inspire, Full of that Flame, his tender Scenes he warms, And frames his Goddess, by your matchless Charms. So may that Fleet, the Pride of Navys stand, So, be each shining Sail, completely mann'd. As you, to Day, shall grace the Poet's Name, Who writes, and lives, but to record your Fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, By the AUTHOR. This the first born, and what he wants in Wit Forgive, you elder Brothers in the Pit: But there, the more Auspicious Signs appear, And every Constellation bright, and clear. By you this day, the Poet hopes to live, Defended by the Sanction, that you give, No surly Critick, or ill natured clown, Where so much Beauty smiles, will dare to frown, Tho' there are some, whose Minds are so diseas'd, That even they are Angry to be Pleas'd Who think the Night ill spent, and Money lost If not repaid at the poor Poet's cost. From such as these, you Fair, defend his Name, And in his safety now, consult your Fame: Some are already Sung, and all shall find The Tribute of the Muse to whom they'r Kind. The Muse and Beauty ever were ally'd, And Nothing should our Interests divide. We both have Foes, the base Lampooner You, As Criticks us much Mortal Spite pursue; Then let us Joyn our Force, and War declare Beauty Support the Muse, The Muse defend the Fair.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Long Walk in a Garden. Enter Irene, Armida, Euphelia. Ire. Compress thy Sighs, and Calm thy Grief, Armida, Thou shalt not be Compell'd to Change thy Love, Thy Father dazled with a Crown's false Lustre, To Pomp and Power would Sacrifice thy Quiet, But I, my Dearest Child, had rather see Thy Happiness, than Grandeur. Arm. Tho' more than Common Duty should be paid, To such Indulgence, in the best of Mothers, Forgive me, Madam, If my Love Presume, Bold Love, who knows no Ties of Blood, or Duty; To Cross, or Contradict what you ordain, When poor Armida can her self Command, You always shall Command Armida. Ir. Not that I Disapprove thy noble Flame, Whose Object Merits all that Man can hope, But since the King so Passionately Loves, Whose Power can take what we refuse to give, You must keep Measures with so great á Rival, With false Appearances Elude his Hope, And sooth his Love, 'till Rodomond return: To fix thy safety by a sure Possession. Arm. O I never Could Dissemble. Ir. But now Necessity must teach you, The Princess too must Counterfeit a Passion, And make the King believe she Loves, As he directs, and that his Choice is hers, Or you are lost for ever; You manage that, and leave the rest to me, Whose Care shall all the Obstacles Remove, That Interfere betwixt you and Happiness: Amuse the King, but Love him not Armida, Of all Mankind renounce the thoughts of Him. Arm. Of all Mankind, I cannot say I hate, But I am sure, that I could never Love him. Ir. The reason you shall know in time, 'tis now Improper, but see your Father and Roderick Approach, let us retire. [Exeunt SCENE II. Enter Gonzalvo and Roderick: Gonz. You hear the news Roderick? Rod. I hear my Lord the Armies are in sight Of one another. Gonz. Yes Roderick, the Silver Po Divides them, Whose beauteous Face, before the setting Sun, With purple Streams will be distain'd: On either Bank an Iron harvest stands Of shaking Spears, which at each other brandish'd, Defiance, Horrour, Death, and Ruine Menace, Till the retreating River in a fright, Forsake his Bed, to make a Passage For the furious Combatants. Rod. Heaven send us Victory. Gon. O fear not that, 'tis Almerich's Sword is Drawn, And the young Rodomond's Arm that weilds it: Rod. But Victory not always is Entaild, The Wise their Conduct lose, the Strong their Force, 'Tis Heaven alone the fate of Empire weighs, Whose Power resistless by all Human Force, Derides our Prudence, and our shallow fore-sight, By Interposing the minutest Accidents Unthought of, Unforeseen, by Man's dim Eyes, Tears from the Victor, what he thought secure, And turns the Fate of Battle. Gon. Thou preachest Roderick, but I'm surpriz'd To find a Courtier talk of Heaven, Who all are Atheists by Profession. Rod. My Lord Gonzalvo, you have known me, long, Tho' bred in Courts, I yet stand uninfected, Nor have their Vices stain'd my spotless Honour, No Servile flattery can guild my Tongue, To poyson Princes, Truth I always spoke, Tho' certain Ruin should attend my Frankness; Besides I always have maintain'd a Faith To Rodomond Inviolable. Gon. My Friend, I know thee Honest, wondrous Honest, Which has for thee Inspired peculiar Love, Thy faith to Rodomond shall be rewarded, When he shall Mount the Lombard's Glorious Throne, The Generous Almerick tho' he slew his Father, In noble Justice to that Prince his Right, Adopts him for his Son, and Successor; And for a Pledge, to make that tie the stronger, Designs his only Child at his return, The Bright Climene, for his Wife. Rod. 'Tis true the noble King has wondrous Virtues, Just, Valiant, Courteous, Merciful and Good, Now Wise as Man, and then as weak as Woman, When head-strong Passion gets the reins of Reason, The force of Nature like too strong a Gale For want of Ballast over-sets the Vessel. Then he's Capricious, Humerous as the Wind, Deaf and Inexorable as a Storm, But strait he cools, and sinks into a Calm, As Mild and Humble as a Child Corrected. Gon. That momentary Weakness shews him Man, But soon his Virtue re-inforc'd takes Place, And like the Sun dispels the Fogs, and Clouds Which over shadow'd his benighted Reason, Then strait the God breaks forth again. Rod. But yet this great, this mighty Victor, who With numerous Swarms pour'd from the frozen North, Like a fierce Torrent, over-flow'd the fair Italian Plains, and bore down all before him, Who Conquer'd Gondibert in single Combat, Then fix'd his Crown on his Victorious Head, And took Ravenna, tho' by you defended, This Heroe now in his Declining Age Turns Foolish boy, and Idly falls in Love With fair Armida, thy most Beauteous Daughter, The Helm of Empire gives to Miscreant Hands, And all Unnerv'd in Lethargies of Love Sleeps in the Vessel that he ought to Steer. Gon. And why not, Roderick, why not love Armida? If Beauty, Virtue, Chastity have Charms, And Royal Blood from Famous Lombard Kings, By me transmitted to her Noble Veins, May make a Virgin worthy of a Crown, The King Descends not when he Courts Armida; But yet I apprehend this Fatal Passion, When Almerick, who cannot Curb his Fury, Shall know that Rodomond's his Rival; Avert the Consequences, Heaven. Rod. It Cannot Long be secret, but see he Comes The generous Goth approaches, an awfull Gloom Spreads o'er his Face, and gnawing Cares of Love. Indent his furrow'd Brows. Enter King: Al. Mal. Alb. Mero, &amp;c. King. The Armies are Engag'd, Gonzalvo, The Valiant Rodomond has pass'd the Po. To Force the Enemy to Battle. Gon. Arm'd with your Genius, Sir, and Sword, He never can miscarry, nor will my Boy, My Adelan, I hope Degenerate. King. O fear not that, thy Blood runs in his Veins, And that will warm him, I oft have seen Thy Son and Rodomond, those Twins of Mars, Run faster to the Fight, than others from a Rout. Mal. That Glorious Prince, so Brave, so vers'd in War, The Peoples Idol, and the Soldiers Darling Must needs present you, Sir, with Conquest, The Soldier's Love, is more than half the Battle. Gonz. Oh, Sir, observe the Poyson of those Words, He never flatters, but he means to Stab. I know thou hat'st Rodomond. [To Mal. Mal. Now, Sir, you see the Malice of my Foes, My most Sincere, and undesigning Words Are always wrested by a false Construction. Kin. No more Gonzalvo, I will have you Friends, 'Tis not in him to give me wrong Impressions Of that Brave Prince, whom I so long have Cherish'd. Thou well remember'st, yet thou must Gonzalvo, That Glorious Day when fate bequeath'd us Empire, Then thou, and I were Foes, but since thy Faith And Matchless Valour made us Friends. Gonz. Yes, Sir, I well remember. King. When at our Legions Head, the brave Old King, And I, like Clouds with Thunder Charg'd, Encountering rush'd together, Long was the Tug of Fate, and Mutual Wounds Receiv'd on either Side, at last my Stars Prevail'd, and Gondibert, o'rethrown by Fate, Resign'd that Life, he so deserv'd to keep, Then Rodomond a Youth fought by his side, Scarce fifteen Summers had pass'd o'er Head, He saw him fall, and with a Filial Love Stood o'er the Sacred Body to defend it, My Arm arrested and Suspended Conquest; Save, Save, O Save, the gallant Youth I Cry'd, Whose Early Manhood's worthy of my Arms, But he resolv'd, not to Survive his Father, Refus'd all Quarter, and disdain'd our Mercy, Four Noble Lives it Cost to Disarm him. [Trumpet without Mal. Heark a Trumpet; News from the Army. Kin. My Stars exert your Heads, and pour Your wonted Influence down. [Enter Tancred with Letters [Kneels to the King: Speak Tancred, speak, how goes the Noble Day? Joy in thy Looks, and Victory in thy Eyes; Tan. The Valiant Rodomond— Kin. I know what thou would'st say, That Rodomond's Victorious Tan. Then Sir Possess, what your Ambition Grasps, And all that Fate can give, Ten thousand Prisoners, and as many Slain Proclaim your Triumphs, thro' the frighted World. [King reads This morning we attaqu'd the Enemy In their Trenches, and, after a Dispute Of four hours, intirely routed them; The Particulars I Leave to Tancred: Here Tancred wear this Jewel for thy News, But first retire, to Ease thy weary Limbs, And then we'll hear the Glorious Tale. [To Tancred Gon. I hope my Son perform'd his part. Tan. My Lord I left him cover'd o'er with Blood, And Honourable Dust, the Prince and He Will both be here to Night. [Exit Tan. King. Rise, Rise, my Joys, Let every where be Triumph. The Wretch who mourns to day shall dye, Tho' he this Minute lost his Mistress. Gon. O how the Noble Story warms my Blood, Contracts each Nerve my Cruel Age Extended, And makes me fit to wield a Sword again. Kin. Thus fortune with new Triumphs Crowns my Arms, But what she gives in Fields; resumes at Home. Noble Ganzalvo, Venerable Old Man, Who gave a being to my Beauteous Mistress, How fares Armida? persevers She still To rack a Miserable Monarch? Gon. I hope the Foolish Virgin will repent, And meet that Honour, which she cannot Merit. Kin. This Night I do design to see her, But first, my Friend, go thou prepare the way, Say every thing, that Friendship can inspire, Say all, that Almerick would say for thee, Use all thy Power, But yet forget the Father, Let no Command o'er-awe her native Sweetness, And if all fail, for me, my Friend, turn Lover, Weep, Sigh, and Beg, Use every moving Word, And make my Love Successful as my Sword. Exit Gon. [The King returns from the Door and walks Pensive over the Stage with Arms folded! Rod. Shake off, great Sir, this Weight of killing Grief, Which thus depresses all your rising Joys, For this great Day, the Gods have given. King. The Joys which Conquest brings, are but a Flash, A Momentary Flash, then disappear, When fiercer Love succeeds with endless Pain, O Roderick, did'st thou never love? Yes sure, For Love's the Passion of a generous Mind, Thou know'st the Dart that has transfix'd my Soul, Whose bearded Point can never be drawn out. But I am torn to pieces: The raging Fire, Like Life and Soul, is spread thro' ev'ry Part, Each melting Nerve is all on flame, And every Fibre burns. Rod. Recal your Glorious Triumphs to your Mind, See there that Image of the God of War, Drive on to Conquest thro' the dusty Field, But now so chang'd you seem no more the same, Than on some guilded Mountain's Top, the faint Reflection of the Sun is Day, When he is set. Kin. No more my Friend, good Roderick, no more, Of foolish Honour, Triumphs and Renown, I now grow weary of that Savage Trade, Methinks by far 'tis better to preserve, Than to destroy; Love's gentle Fire, Has melted all the Brutal Hero down, While the more Noble Passions like pure Gold Sink in a Lump, abstracted from their Dross; 'Tis you, O Malespine, and such as you Unhappy Ministers to cheated Princes, Who make new Quarrels, new Pretences find, To please us Wretches, who destroy Mankind. [Ex. Kin. Gon. Manent Alb. Mal. Mer. Mal. Yes, yes, Prince Rodomond hates me, Most mortally, Albazar, he knows That I betray'd his Father, which he Severely will revenge, when ever on the Throne. Alb. We therefore must prevent it. Mal. Prevent it, yes, but how Albazar? I've try'd a thousand ways to work his Ruine with the King But still in vain, he's Deaf to all my Arts, So Down-right, Generous, Frank, and open He thinks Mankind as Honest as himself, He means no Ill, and consequently fears none. Alb. The Goth's not yet worn off, Italian Air, In time will make him wiser. Mal. My Friend, in this Emergency assist, Thou had'st a Soul once form'd for Glorious Mischief, The Rival Prince returns with Lawrels Crown'd, To wed Climene, and destroy my Hopes. Alb. There yet is one Resource. Mal. O speak my better Angel. Alb. The Spies which I by your Command employ, Inform me that there is a mighty Love 'Twixt Rodomond, and Armida. Mal. Confirm it Heav'n: Can this be true? Alb. As true as 'tis a mighty Secret. Mal. Rise, rise, my Genius then the worst is done, Here's Glorious Matter for a Scene of Mischief, Tho' unsusceptible his heedless Soul Of Jealousie, where Empire is concern'd, His stronger Passion will admit no Rival, His Love cut down all that shall grow before it, Cramm'd to the Throat with Sulphur he'll take Fire To burn himself, and Rodomond. Alb. So far 'tis well, but you my Lord this while Forget your Love, Cimene is forgot. Mal. Poor weak Albazar, Can'st thou think I love? A Statesman Love Albazar? No, no, Whose Soul is with Ambition Fir'd, Can have no room for any other Passion, The poys'nous Shade of that destructive Plant, Will suffer nothing to grow near it, Or like the Plague in Epidemick Years, Turns all the Less Distempers to it's self, Alb. But sure there may be Intervals for Love. Mal. So far from Love, or any Generous flame, That he, like me, who would be great, Albazar, Must Conscience drown as Harlots Choak their Infants, Must Stifle all the Sentiments of Nature, Break thro' the Ties of Honour and of Blood, Of Friendship, Common Faith, and Gratitude, Dissolve the Bands, that first linkt Men together, When mutual wants, from Nature's Common call'd, The happier Savage into fatal Cities, All this I've done to Gondibert already, And must repeat to Almerick. Alb. But since her Title will Confirm your Claim Methinks 'tis better to have her Consent. Mal. That is all one, when I have Power, When I am Master of the Father's Throne, With Ease I shall possess the Daughter. Let other Lovers Languish, sigh and Whine And meanly stoop, to Court Imperious Beauty, Like Foolish Chymists Sweat and Toyl in vain To find Elixirs only in the Brain. Youth, Wealth, and Time, in the pursuit all spent, When they would prove the Dear Experiment; The Golden Joys, the Lover's Hope to find, In Fumes are flown, and onely Dross behind. [Exeunt The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Gonz. Arm. Euph. Gon. I say you must not, must not, my Armida, Think more of Rodomond. Arm. Who can but think of that Illustrious Prince, Who thinking not admires, and then Not turn their Admiration into Love. Gon. There are Eternal Bars between you, You know that he's design'd for bright Cimene, And with her Love, the Throne. Arm. My thoughts, my Lord, are scarce so vain To hope I shall be happy in my Love, All that I ask of Heav'n and You, Is Leave to Love, what I must ne'er possess, Love him alone, and never hear of others. Gon. Not hear of others? O what means thy Folly, When at thy Feet a dying Monarch lies, The Glory, and the Terrour of the World, Armida, change thy inauspicious Love, And mount the mighty Almerick's Throne. Arm. You know, my Lord, the Prince and I Have underneath one Roof been bred, That Habit first contracted such a Friend, As knit by Just Degrees to Love, That Love, to such a Noble, Ardent Passion So deeply rooted, and so firm, It cannot now transplanted be nor touch'd, Without destroying of the Tree. Gon. The Change of Soil may meliorate the Plant, The King designs to visit you to night, Receive that Honour with good Grace. Arm. What! Change my Love, my Rodomond? With all the Charms of Majesty, and Youth, Cover'd with Lawrels, and adorn'd with Fame, For the Addresses of a Prince, whose Age May justly bid me call him Father. Gonz. By Heav'n thou know'st not what is good, Armida, The King's not young 'tis true, nor is he old, Just on the Summit of the Hill of Life, He sees as much before him, as behind, An Easie, Gentle, Long Descent of Time, Where with the Heighth's Advantage he looks round, While they who climb, can have but half the Prospect, Yet thou prefer'st the Spring of giddy Youth, To that Mature, and far more perfect Age, Fraught with the Noble Harvest of Man's Life, Experience, Temper, and consummate Wisdom: Thy Rodomond, 'tis true has all the Charms, And shining Qualities, of a Glorious Prince, Virtues, which without Title to a Crown, Would give a Subject merit to pretend, But yet believe me, O believe me, Child, Whose silver Hairs with Ills have dearly bought A long Experience; The Fire of Youth's too hot, Too furious to last long, is but a Lamp, Whose Flame too great, most greedily drinks up That Unctuous Liquor, which shou'd feed its Being, Then dies, and vanishes in Smoak, Such is the Love of Youth. Arm. 'Tis that bright Fire so warms the Heroe's Blood, And makes the difference in Men. Gon. No, No, too hot, too like the Summer Sun, When on the Lion's back, with Beams direct He Burns, and Withers, what he should but Nourish, But riper Age when grown Sedate, Like a fine Autumn Day, has every Charm, Bright without dazling, without Scorching Warm. Exit Gon. Arm. How strange a Fate attends my Love, What can the Happiest of my Sex desire, But what I seem to have? I Love, and find My Love with Interest return'd, the bravest Man The Spacious Earth sustains, is proud to lay His Laurels at my Feet But still the fatal Passion of the King Obstructs our Wishes, and destroys our hopes. Eup. I always thought, Love was the greatest good, In all the pretty tales I ever read, Tho' lowring Fortune for a while did frown, Some kinder Stars at last shin'd out to make The Lovers happy. Arm. O shun that Passion, as thou would'st thy bane, The deadliest foe to human Happiness, That Poysons all our Joys, destroys our Quiet. If thy well guarded Breast has yet secur'd, Thy tender Heart, Euphelia, from his rage, Congratulate thy Stars, thrice happy Maid, And by my Wreck, the fatal Shelf avoid, Love, Like a Beauteous Field, at first appears, Whose pleasing Verdure ravishes the Sight, But all within the hollow, treacherous Ground, Is nought but Caverns of Perdition. Eup. 'Tis, Madam, time to wait upon the Princess. Arm. I goe, Euphelia, to see The best of Women, and the best of Friends, Into her gentle Bosom pour my Sighs, The only Balm to my afflicted Mind, Her generous Pity softens every Grief, For all the wretched Love to be condol'd, Such is the Use, and Noble End of Friendship To bear a part in every Storm of Fate, And by Dividing, Lighter make the Weight. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Scene Opens: Cimene, Rosane. SONG. Da. How long, my Flavia, shall your Swain? Thus sue to bend that stubborn Heart. How long will you disguise your pain And Fondly Triumph in your Art: Flavi. In vain alass we would be wise, Cease, Damon, Cease thy Song; In Vain we would with Art disguise When Nature is too strong: Da. Then let me, Fair, thy Pity move, To make me once the happy Man, O Flavia, once Indulge my Love, And then be Cruel, if you can. Flavi. When Foolish Maids with Ease Comply, Contempt is Justly due; We first of all, we first must fly, Before you can pursue. Da. Thro' folly you deny my suit, In Ignorance your Virtue Lies, When the first Maid had Pluck'd the Fruit, She only tasted and grew Wise. Flav. I yield my Swain, I yield at last, Ah, do not now despise, Since 'tis my Destiny to taste, Come teach me to be Wise. After the SONG: Enter Arm. Ir. Euph. Cim. Armida welcome, I have long'd to see you, But why those graceful Sorrows on that Brow? Why frown those Looks by Nature form'd to smile? Methinks the News of Rodomond's Success, And quick return, shou'd make your hopes revive. Arm. He comes, 'tis true, but never to be mine, You, happy Princess, have a greater share In his good Fortune, than the lost Armida. Cim. I! Armida? Arm. Yes, you Cimene. Cim. What means my Friend? Arm. My Father has been with me from the King, And that his Arguments may more prevail, To dis-engage me from my plighted Faith, Assures me Rodomond is lost to me, That now at his return, the King designs To join your Hands. Cim. So soon! O Heav'ns how shall we ward This cruel Stroak? Arm. 'Tis not in Fate, and I am lost for ever, This night, this night, the Glorious Victor comes, Adorn'd with all the shining Wreaths of Fame, Cimene must reward the Heroe's toil, Cimenes soft Caresses must deface The Memory of Scars, and dire Fatigues, Of tedious Hours in Winter Camps consum'd; Oh happy Princess, glorious in my Ruins, You only can deserve, what 'tis my Fate to lose. Cim. I Glorious in thy Ruins? Arm. Mine, Mine Cimene. Cim. Unjust Armida, you seem with Envy Picqu'd, To look on me, as if I were your Rival, You know how my Affection stands engag'd, You know your Brother has possess'd my Heart, The Noble Adelan is there too strong, To be in danger of another's Love, But this Reflection is unkind, Unworthy of our Friendship. Arm. Forgive me Princess, I am much too blame My Cruel Fortunes so distract my Mind, I know not hardly what I say. Ir. 'Tis now no time, for Childish, Vain Complaints, The Refuge of the Abject in Distress, Propose some way, to stop the present ill, Amuse the King, and Frustrate his Design, The Danger pressing Calls for Resolution. Cim. I see no way, but positive Denial; Had we more time, there might be some Resource. Ir. Such a Refusal, wou'd but Wing your Fate; The King Enrag'd to find his hopes deceiv'd, To find a Son, a long Expected Son, Reject his Daughter, and become his Rival, Wou'd ruine all who dare his Will oppose. Cim. But since or First, or Last we must refuse, And the impending Storm cannot be shun'd; Methinks 'tis Nobler for to meet our Fate, The Danger will be sooner past. Arm. I stand prepar'd for ev'ry Shock, And all the bane, ill-mingled Stars can shed, Since Rodomond is all the World to me; And losing him, I must lose all I hope. Let Fortune Rage, they sure are fond of Life Who wou'd the World survive. Cim. Ah! Wretched Maid, I cou'd thy Fate deplore, But Pity only from the happy's due. My Gloomy Stars are Intricate as thine, I Love like thee, and yet conceal my flame, Which burns the more, the more it is supprest, But you perhaps may Wonder at my Prudence. Arm. Prudence, Cimene? the more of that, Just so much less of Love. Enter Woman. Wom. Madam, the King! Arm. I fly, Cimene, for I dare not see him, And yet I must this fatal Night, Like a poor Criminal Condemn'd, who knows That he must Dye, yet vainly would Defer The fatal Minute. Ir. Compliance feign, and so procure delay. Enter King, Gonz. Roder, Alb. Mer. &amp;c. King. Prepare, Cimene, to Adorn this Night; Prepare the God-like Victor to receive, By great Atchievments worthy of thy Love. 'Tis you alone who can repay the Debt We owe to such Illustrious Merit. Cim. You Injure, Sir, the Glory of the Prince, To rate his mighty Services to Love, As to be recompenc'd by me. King, Cimene and a Crown! What more Can his Ambition, tho' 'twere boundless, hope? What more can I repay? Cim. Not, that I would so despicable seem, But that a Monarch may be justly proud To yield his Heart to Charms as weak as mine. But— King. No more Excuses: What I Command, Without reserve, a Daughter must obey: My Prudence this Alliance has design'd; And 'tis your Duty to approve my Choice. Cim. Tho' none more filial, Piety shall obey, Tho' none, shall more Implicitly receive, As Sacred, all your Pleasure shall Command; In this one point permit me a Reserve, Where all the happiness of Life's concern'd. Let your indulgence, Sir, divide your Power; The Father soften, what the King Commands. King. I'll hear no more, resolve to acquiesce, And make my Will thy Choice: Thou know'st not sure The value of the gift I offer. Cim. If that were all to hinder my assent, It wou'd be height of Madness to refuse, Or Blindness not to see the Prince's Merit. But, Sir, suppose he sees not with your Eyes, And disapproves the Choice you make for him; He never yet to me confest a flame. Or what is worse, may be indifferent. King. Thou know'st not sure thy Charms, Cimene, Thus to distrust their Power. [Shouts at distance Enter Malespine. Mal. The Prince is at the Gates. King. Is all prepar'd to grace the Noble Triumph? Mal. Your Orders are obey'd: In Purple Robes, With Solemn State, the Magistrates proceed; The Streets adorn'd, the Doors with Statues grac'd, Vast Thronging Crouds retar'd the great Procession, Whose loud repeated Shouts divide the Air. While fluttering Birds their empty Pinions Shake, With Garlands crown'd the Virgins strow the ways, And in glad Hymns repeated his Glorious Name, While joyful Mothers to their Wondring Babes Point out the Heroe, as he drives along. Gon. aside] See, Roderick, see, this Villain now designs To stir up the Kings Envy. King. Can this be heard, and thou not melt Cimene? Go, go, my Child; but leave these Frowns behind, Adorn thy self, as for my Nuptial Day. With all the Charm, and splended Pomp of Beauty; With all the Graces, that your Sex assume When they design a Conquest. Cim. For Women, Sir, to offer Love is far below The Dignity of the Sex; Our Fond Advances make the Men more vain, Whose wandring Flames are like that Treacherous Fire In marshy Fenns, from Exhalations bred; Which when pursu'd before us runs. And follows when we Fly: We Covet still, what we acquire with Pain, For Love, like Eastern Majesty conceal'd; Is more ador'd, the less he is reveal'd. [Ex. Cum. Roz. King. She bears a Spirit worthy of her Blood; Worthy the Heroe for her Bed design'd, Whose Merrit Claims the Mistress of the World: There was a time, this Arm perform'd like him. Gonz. Noble Examples Noble Deeds exites. The Prince with generous Emulation fir'd, Treads in your steps, and that bright tract pursues. Mal. But undiscerning Men forget the Past; The present still adore. King. No more of that, those thoughts be gone; 'Tis base to Envy what we shou'd Admire. Enter Tanored. Tan. Prince approaches. [Trumpets and Shouts within. Enter Rodomond in Triumph, Adelan, Officers, &amp;c. King. Welcome as Life, as Victory, and Fame, As hope to Lovers, or the Tortur'd Wretch Cessasion of his Pain. O, Rodomond! [Embraces. How shall my Gratitude return the vast, The boundless Sum I owe? Rodo. Your glorious service is its own reward; For Almerick I fought; like Almerick o'ercame. [King and Rod. seem talking. Gon. My Noble Son, as welcome to These Arms: [Embraces. Thou Prop and comfort of my useless Age, Thy early Glories in the Chace of Fame, Reflect new Lustre, and our House confirm. Ad. I shou'd degenerate my Lord, At humble distance, shou'd I not pursue Your glorious Steps, and shew from whence I came: 'Tis Natures most Inviolable Law, To make each Species propogate its kind; The generous Off-spring from the generous Stock, Derive the Virtues, and confess the Sire. King and Rod. Advance. Rod. Impute, Great King, no more to my desert, What Fortune, or your Genious gave. King. O Rodomond, there is but one return My Pow'r can make: Thou know'st I have design'd My only Daughter for your Bed and Throne; It were unjust, now longer to defer Your Mutual Bliss, to Morrows Sun Shall grace your happy Nuptials. Ro. Starts aside.] The Thunder breaks, I must dissemble. Ha! Thou seem'st surpriz'd! what wants Cimene, Virtue, Charms, or Blood? Rod. Far from my Soul, be such an impious Thought; The Princess stands of every Grace possess'd, Of every Charm that bounteous Nature gives, Or Women think they have. King. Why seem you doubtful to accept my gift? Rod. Her Sanction can only confirm the Grant; I have not yet deserv'd so great a Blessing. Tho' you have power to give Cimenes hand [Arm. appears in the Balcony. 'Tis the Owner should dispose her Heart; Cimene first must give me leave to Love, While I endeavour to deserve that Honour. Ar. Above.] He yields, he yields, O false Perfidious Prince! [Exit. King. She has no Choice, no Interest, or Will, Her Hopes, her Thoughts must Center all in mine: By my Command, she now expects your coming. Rod. You may Command; a Lover first shou'd Wooe. King. Go Wooe her then, and all thy Stars attend: Conduct him, Roderick, to the Princess. O happy Youth, thou need'st but ask, And all that Fate can give, is in thy reach, While my successless Love invokes the Wind. Lead on Gonzalvo, to Armida. [Ex. King Gonz. &amp;c. Manent Rod. Roder, &amp;c. Rod. Lead on Gonzalvo to Armida! Oh! that sound, Those fatal accents pierce my trembling Soul; I hop'd repulses wou'd have cur'd his Love, But still I find he perseveres. O Roderick! My faithful Friend, in every Scene of Life, Maintains the bright Armida still the Field? Resists she still the Kings repeated Storms? Roder. Not Rooted Oaks the force of raging Winds, Nor Natures Barrs, on their Strong Basis fixt, Repel the fury of Insulting Waves With greater firmness, than resolv'd Armida Defies the Charms of Majesty and Power. But, O, desist, this Love can ne'r succeed. Ad. O Rodomond, what strange malignant Stars Thus blast our Loves! and Nip our hopes of Joy! We both aspire with the most Glorious flames, And yet are forc'd our Passions to disguise! There very mention carries Fate. Rod. 'Tis great to suffer for so brave a Cause, Which will the firmness of our Courage try, We must, my Friend, Resolve to bear the Storm, First to our beautious Mistresses repair, With them Consult what measures to pursue, Support their Virtue, and their Love confirm. As for my self, I'll shew the wondering World The Noblest Sacrifice, Love ever made; Make all confess, how far a generous flame Transcends Ambition, and the hope of Crowns; In any other Cause it wou'd be wrong The Glittering Charms of Scepters to despise: But bright Armida is the Nobler Prize, And boundless Empire triumphs in her Eyes.

Obstruct no more thy Glory, and thy Fate, Receive thy Fortune, which with open Arms Flies to embrace thee: O relent, relent, Accept a Monarch, and ascend a Throne. Arm. Tho' vain my Youth, tho' vainer is my Sex, My warmest thoughts durst never yet aspire To feed the hope of such a glittering Folly; No, no, my Stars some meaner choice design, Whose Faith, whose Love and Constancy may Merit The poor return that I can make. King. Merit, Armida? If none but who deserve you may pretend, Mankind must yield, and the Dispute is over. Ev'n I, who Love the best of human race, Adorn'd with Majesty, and Arm'd with Power, Cannot pretend to such Exalted Merit, No, Almerick must despair; and thou Armida, Live And die a Virgin. Arm. When Kings beneath their Majesty Descend, And take unequal Partners to their Beds, Experience shews, ill Consequence still Attend the weakness of their Choice. King. What canst thou fear, when mounted on my Throne? What canst thou hope, my Love will not confirm? Arm. Cou'd reason guide us in the paths of Love, To whom might not great Almenick pretend? But since by Destiny we Love or Hate, Since some resistless power unseen debars The freedom of our Choice, and sways the Will, Impute not my Misfortune, to a Crime; I cannot Love the King. King. O Armida! Why wer't thou fram'd so exquisitely Fair, The Angel stamp'd upon that beautious Face, Without a Mind proportion'd to thy Form? Bright as a Star, why wilt thou not pour down Propitious influence to preserve Mankind? But like a Comet, with portensous blaze Of threatning beauty shine, and arm'd with Fate, Presage Destruction, and the Fall of Kings. Arm. What you Demand I want the power to Give; But with reluctance 'tis that I refuse To Crown the Merit of that Glorious Prince; Whom I shall always Honour, and Esteem, But never Love.— King. Never, Armida! O, recall that sound. That Breath conveys my Fate. That balmy breath which wou'd the dead revive, Make the warm'd blood in purple mazes Dance, And re-assume the interrupted round, Arm'd with those fatal accents of Despair, While you relentless, thus pronounce my doom, Kills like a Basilisk; O, Savage Maid! Revoke thy hasty Sentence. Arm. 'Tis fix'd as Fate, and never can be chang'd. King. Here will I rooted grow 'till thou relent, Thou most Inhuman of thy Sex; kneel, kneel, Gonzalvo, kneel, and keep thy wretched Prince In Countenance; Invert the Laws of Nature, And suppliant bow that Venerable Head, To bend ungrateful Beauty. [Pulls down Gonz. Arm. Whar means the King? what means my Father? Oh! I shall die with shame; Rise, Rise, I conjure you, Rise, and leave a wretched Maid To her ill Fate, who never can Comply: O Never, Never. Gonz. Unworthy Off-spring of a Generous Race, Thy Mother's Milk ne'r nurs'd that Savage Nature; How canst thou hear, unmov'd, those melting sighs Wou'd tame the fierceness of relenting Tygers? Thus, Thus I tear thee from my bleeding Breast; Fly from my Sight, remote as from my Heart. Arm. Why did you give me Life to make me wretched? Resume that gift, and I will bless the Blow: I yield to die; but would not live unhappy. Gonz. O Sir, forget her, the Fool cannot deserve The Honour you design; convert your Love To noble Scorn and Indignation. King. O that I could, Gonzalvo! O that my rage, Blown to the height, could now repel my Love, As Storms of Thunder drive against the Wind! I burn, I burn, and never shall have ease. Gonz. Call in your Pride to help your struggling Virtue To lay this Storm which Tears you by the Roots, With Patience.— King. Patience! the refuge of poor stupid Cowards; Go, bid some Massy Ponderous falling weight Fly from it's Center, and remount the Air; Then, then, I will be patient. Gonz. But Sir— King. I cou'd swallow Seas, Pour down the Danube, pour the Volga down, When melting Snows extend his broken Shores, When with Impetuous hast his Torrents Rowl: Not all those congregated flouds can Quench, The raging Feavour in my Blood. Gonz. For Heav'ns sake be Calm; and vex no more That generous Heart, whose every sigh Is worth the whole Inchanting Sex. King. I will be Calm, Gonzalvo, yes, I'll Fly Back to the Frozen North, from whence I came, To the remotest Worlds extended Coast; Where all things end, and Nature is no more. T'listring Savages impart my Moan, And curse the Beauteous Author of my Woes. Gonz. O Royal Almenick, thy grief distracts me! King. There in some lonely Cave rettir'd Revolve the Tails which Priests and Poets feign To paint the Sex so Cruel. The Bard who charm'd the shades made furies weep, And lull'd the Damn'd amidst their pains to sleep; Who Panthers cou'd reclaim, or Beasts more fell, Cou'd not the rage of furious Woman Quell; Her wilder Heart no power of sound cou'd tame, While the Creation melted with my Flame [Exit King, Gonz. Manent Arm. Euph. Arm. Was ever such a wretch Euphelia?

Despond not, Madam, sure the powers above Such Innnocence and Virtue will relieve! But see Prince Rodomond approaches. Enter Rodomond. Rodo. Tho' Surges beat, and boystrous Winds repel, Through Seas and Tempests I have made my way, Like young Leander to the Sestian Maid. Do I behold those Eyes again Armida? Arm. My Rodomond, if I may call you mine, Whom destiny for ever will divide; These flowing Eyes, these sighs but ill become A glorious Victor's Triumph and return. Rodo. O dry those Tears, those Drops of Liquid Pearl, More precious far than Aromatick Gums, Or fragrant Balm, which Eastern Groves Distil. Arm. You opportunely to my rescue come, The furious King abandon'd to his passion, Has now pursued me with his fatal Love, With Threats, and Promises, and every Art, To make me violate my Faith to you, That Faith and Constancy, which much I fear Thou, Rodomond, deserv'st not. Rodo. Who can deserve Armida? But if Arm. Dissemble not, Excuses will be vain, And only serve to aggravate thy Crime; Too well I know thy false perfidious Vows, Thy broaken Oaths are driven by the Winds. How cou'dst thou treat me so ungentle, Rodomond? Rod. Whoever told Armida such a falshood, Cou'd I th'officious Villain know— I— Arm. There is no need of any other proof, 'Tis I my self am witness of thy Crime; Had I not seen, I never cou'd believe. Rod. Unjust Armida, how wou'd you wrong my Honour? But 'tis the trade of your deceiving Sex: You weary grown, wou'd break the ties between us, And your own falshood thus impute to me. Arm. Unheard of insolence! Fly from my sight Ungreatful Prince. Rod. Is this Armida? the Gentle, Kind Armida! Soft as the breezes of a Vernal Morn, And mild as Infants newly Rock'd to sleep; Such, such I left her: Oh, but now how chang'd! I seem some poor Knight errant in Romance, Who Battles Won, and Monstrous Gyants Slain, Returns to lay his Trophies at her Feet, Whose Smiles can only recompence his Toil; When vile Inchanters the bright Virgin steal, And in her stead, some Fairy Elf convey. Arm. Fly from my sight, how cou'd I Love So false a Man! Be baser if thou canst And Cure my Passion. Enter Roderick. Rodom. Speak Roderick, speak, I see Disaster in thy looks, thou ne'r cou'dst take A better time to tell the worst of news. Roder. O, Sir, forgive me. Rodo. I tell thee Fate can now not cast me Lower, My Ruin's Finish'd, all that thou canst say With present Woes compar'd, will be a Scene of Joy; A Conquerours transport in the Field of Battle. Roder. The King Enrag'd— Rodom. Speak on, I am prepar'd. Roder. The King enrag'd at his rejected Love, Met treacherous Malespine, as he left Armida; He has the secret of your Love betraid; At which, not able to contain his Fury, The King declaims you faln from your Command, Your Posts, and Honours, and threatens Vengeance On your Head. Rodo. I'm not surpriz'd; I did expect this Blow! But see Armida how you wrong my Love, My Honour, and my Faith; this base, this false Perfidious Man, however shall obey you, Yes, I will go; As Seamen wrack'd on some inhuman Coast For safety make the Land, and then are lost, Thus I pursu'd by fate, When to those Arms, my only port I hast, Where all my hopes of happiness were plac'd, By the fierce Savage from the Shore am Chas'd. Rodo. Stay Rodomond, stay, 'tis I Commanded you stay. [going out. Rodo. That Voice wou'd raise me from the Grave. Roder. Hold, hold, my Lord, you die if you return. That Syren Voice recals you to your Fate; To that inevitable sinking Sand On which you split before. Rodo. Away, and let me hug my ruine. [Pushes him away, Embraces her. Arm. Were you a Lover, you wou'd surely bear The weakness of your Mistress's Passion: First know the cause re' you Condemn My kind obliging Jealousie. Roder. He's lost again, for ever lost! I cannot stay to see his ruin. Exit. Arm. Led by my Love, I unobserv'd o'erheard Your Conversation with the King; And when I thought you yielded to his Will, I entertain'd this just Suspicion. Rodo. By Heav'n I only did Dissemble. Arm. Whoe'r, Rodomond, like me can Love! Like me, cannot Dissemble! But why shou'd I complain, if you forsake That wretch, whose fatal Love has thus undone thee? O fly, with Tears I beg thee shun my Love, There is Contagion in my Fate. Rodo. He is not ruin'd, who wou'd not be sav'd; Tho' Tumbl'd headlong from my shining Sphear, Thy Gentle Bosom breaks the mighty fall, Be thou but constant, and I ask no more; Fortune can nothing give, and nothing take. Arm. Bear record Heav'n, and all the conscious Stars, Who doom our Loves to this Disastrous Fate; Tho' Almerick; Like thee, were Lovely, Beautiful and Young; Tho' to his Empire the rich East were joyn'd, And his Dominions boundless as his Love; Tho' he wou'd make me Mistress of Mankind, With Noble Scorn I wou'd Insult his flame, Reject the Monarch, and a Crown disdain. Rodo. Hear, in return, Armida, what I Swear, Tho' Fair Cimene all her Sex out Shin'd; Tho' he who mounts her Bed, ascends a Throne; Tho' Empire, Power, Glory, Riches, all That wretched Mortals, Happiness, Misname, Attend her Love, and the Refusal, Death; Fix'd as the Pole, I never will comply; But with Armida Live, or for Armida Dye. [Exunt. SCENE II. A Long Garden. Enter Mal. Alb. Mero. Mal. 'Tis done, 'tis done, Albaza. Prince Rodomond's ruine is Compleat, Above the very prospect of my hopes; Iv'e blown the King to such a height of rage, As will his Rival Crush to pieces. Alb. You mind the minute, and your Fortune caught, Or else this glazing Meteor had Eclips'd Your fading Lustre, and destroy'd your Power: All Eyes were fix'd on him, and every Voice Proclam'd his Triumphs, magnified by Fame; While you, who in his absence rul'd the Day, Seem'd but a Shadow when you shin'd before. Mal. What you observe, Albazer, is too true; When I with all the Courtiers Little Arts, And deep dissimulation humbly bowd To welcome his return, he cast a Glance, A haughty Glance, which seem'd to speak contempt, And scarse vouchsaf'd a supercilious Nod. Alb. Thus far, my Lord, you with the current Sail; You've thrown the Rival of your Power down, But if at last, through force, he shou'd comply, And be restor'd to Favour and Command, He'll rise the higher, and revenge his fall: The dead can only do no harm.— Mal. Yes, he shall Dye; but we that point must manage, And wisely throw the Odium on the King, He must perform, what we our selves desire Meroan. Mero. My Lord. Mal. Have you the Largess to the Soldiers given? Mer. I have my Lord. Mal. And how did they receive it? Mer. With all the sense of Gratitude; They Vow their Lives and Honour Devoted to your Service. Mal. All things Concur, my Friend, to raise our hopes; The Prince remov'd, the King defenceless stands, Beset with Foes, and destitute of Friends: On Rodomonds Virtue all his Power is built; That Basis sap'd, the tott'ring fabrick falls. Alb. The Legions here in Town are ours; And if the Army, who the Prince Adore, Shou'd meditate Revenge, a Sum of Gold Dispers'd among them will their Fury cool: That Mercenary wretch who Fights for Gold, With Gold will be Corrupted. But see the King! you must contrive To feed his Fury with new fuel. Enter King, Gonz. Roder, &amp;c. King. He dies, by Heav'n he dies, Gonzalvo; Ungrateful Rodomond shall die: And could he Hidra like receive again, Each several day, a several Fate should give. Gonz. O, Sir, let not your Fury thus transport That Godlike Mind to Violent Extreams; Our Passions always fatal Council give; Through their fallacious Glass our Wrongs appear Still greater than they are. King. Reject my Daughter, and Invade my Love! What can he add to such a wrong? My Love Is sacred as my Crown; and he who dares To Rival me in one, will make no scruple To Invade the other. Gonz. His Soul abhors the Thoughts of such a Crime. Remember, Sir, his Virtue and your Love, That fond Paternal Love you always shew'd, Which he with Filial Piety return'd; Shou'd now your Rage this hasty Sentence give, You wou'd repent th'irrevocable blow. Mal. Besides, the Loss which wou'd his Death attend: His recent Triumphs on the Banks of Po Have so indear'd him to the Soldiers Hearts, Seditious Spirits may their Rage incite To Mutiny and Revenge. King. 'Tis fitter for that Reason he shou'd die, Thou mak'st my Justice necessary, Malespine; He who by Dying can disturb my Peace, May, Living, shake my Throne: But I Contemn those little Fears. O Gonzalvo, Thou know'st I Lov'd, and fain wou'd Love him still, 'Tis Rodomond only, Rodomond can save, Go thou Gonzalvo, and use all thy Art To bring his Passion down to Reason's Lure; If thou succeed not, I will try my self For once, I'll strive to bend this stubborn Man Let him resign Armida, and he Lives: Accept Cimene, and he Reigns. O Malespine! [Exit Gonz. How vain is Empire, and how useless Power, Which cannot purchase one poor Virgins Heart? Mal. 'Tis not your want of Power, but of Will: Exert the King, and who'll resist the Lover? Tho' seeming Coy, few women will complain Of grateful Force, that lifts them to a Throne. King. I wou'd not Plunder, Malespine, but Conquer; The Rape destroys the pleasure of Fruition; I wou'd be Happy, or I wou'd be Cur'd: They say, that Musick has resistless Charms, To Quell the Tumults of an Anxious Breast. If Sounds can heal the poysonous Insects Bite, Why not the Sting of Love? For Love is sure One kind of Poyson: Sound, Sound all Our Instruments of War, with Vocal Air Sonorous Mettal fill, whose sprightly breath New Life imparts and warms the Cowards Blood. Martial Loud Musick Plays, the King Listens. Higher, yet higher; raise th'Extatick Sound, With all, the Symphony of Martial Notes, Such, such as in the Field of Battle Proclaim'd our Triumphs when the Lombard fell. Martial Musick still Plays, the King stands List'ning. It works! it works! the Dancing Spirits rise, Soft Love retires, and Furies seize my Breast; Bring forth the Warlike Steed, my shining Arms, I will revenge my Quarrel on Mankind, And Nations Drown'd in Seas of Blood, Armida's Cruelty shall Rue. Arm. and Cim. appears at the other end of the Garden, Crossing the Stage. See there she goes, how weak is human force, In Competition with her Eyes? Cease, Cease Those Harsh, and Ill Concording Sounds, which Arm With Steel the Heart, and make us Deaf to Nature, Sink, sink to gentle and melodious strains, Soft as the Passions of my melting soul, And warm as new desire. [Soft Musick Plays, the King listens. I will pursue her. Roder. Stay Royal Almenick, stay, or you are lost; Wou'd you be safe, fly from the Victors Eyes: When with our Passions we make Noble War, 'Tis Glorious to Retreat, and Victory to Fly. King. I wou'd be sav'd; but by Armida's Smiles. The Merchant Stranded, and his Fortune's Lost, Fix'd on the Floating Mast each God implores, With longing Eyes the distant Mountains views, And Vows he'll never trust the Ocean more: But when escap'd, all his Resolves are vain. Thus I, relapsing, re-assume my Chain, Forget my Danger, and Renew the Pain. [Exit. Manent Mal. Alb. Mer. Mal. That Qualm of Virtue frightned me, Albazar, But see, he swallows all the Bait again, And Running to his Fate prevents my Guilt: Thus Men are always ruin'd by themselves, And falsly call the Stars, or Heav'n unkind, When all Contribute to the Ills they find. [Exeunt omnes. The End of the third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Scene I. Enter Adelan and Cimene. Adel.] I am content to bear a Lover's Pain, Wou'd you vouchsafe a Lover's Hope. Cime.] Where so much Merit challenges my Love, Without a Blush I may confess a Flame, A Noble Passion founded on Esteem. Adel.] Why will you then obstruct our Happiness, And scruple thus to gratifie that Passion? Cime.] The Danger frightens, not o'recomes my Love; By Rodomond's Fate we shou'd be warn'd. Adel.] The Danger only shou'd enhance the Price, And make us dearer to our selves, Cimene; Our happier Friends will leave us in the Race, This Night they are resolv'd to seize their Wishes, Anticipate the King, and joyn each others Hands: Would you consent, our Bliss wou'd equal theirs. Cime.] O Adelan, urge not our mutual Ruine, I wou'd consent, and yet my Fear forbids: See Rodomond appears; let us observe him. Enter Rodomond. Rodo.] To Day a Conquerour, and to Night a Slave: How short the Space between these vast Extreams? If what I lose, is in it self no Good, But on Opinion founded, and Mistake, Opinion then, may all I've lost restore, 'Tis but to think, that I am not unhappy. Adelan and Cimene advance. Cim.] When Heav'n thinks fit the Guiltless to afflict, It gives them Vertues, Rodomond, like thine, To bear with Patience, such a Load of Wrongs. Rodo.] The Gods, and God-like Kings, can do no Wrongs. Illustrious Princess, we must then resign, [Bowing. And bear the Fate, which they are pleas'd to doom. Ade.] We must be patient, when we can't redress; But when we've Power to repel the Wrong, He Spirit wants, who wants Resentment. Rodo.] What means the generous Adelan? Ade.] Your Patience is Injustice to your self: Fly to the Army, where you are ador'd; By them supported in so just a Cause, Demand your Mistress, and your Right. Rodo.] I shou'd deserve the Fate, which you bemoan, Cou'd I be guilty of so base a Crime: You know my Obligations to the King; Can I revolting, break those Sacred Ties, And draw that Sword, which honour'd once this Arm, Against the Breast that gave it? Ade.] The Gift resum'd, the Obligation dies; You are discarded, and disgrac'd. Rodo.] But not releas'd from the vast Debt I owe. No, Adelan, believe me, I will dye; Or, what is worse, will live, and lose Armida, Before I'll stain my Honour with that Baseness, Whatever Fortune shall attend my Love: This Satisfaction lessens all the Pain, That I shall not deserve it. Ade.] This nice romantick Honour is your Ruine, And offers Violence to Nature. Cim.] Unhappy Prince, worthy a better Fate; I share those Wrongs, I wish I cou'd redress. [Is going. Ade.] Hold, bright Cimene, hold: By all our Vows, Our mutual Vows, seal'd in the Face of Heaven, I now conjure you to compleat our Bliss This happy Night, by giving me that Hand. Cim.] My stronger Passion will surmount my Fears; In vain depending on our Strength we strive; Vertue, tho' arm'd, our Passions may suprize, So weak is Prudence, when oppos'd to Love: Since Innocence is Ignorance of Ill, And in that Innocence our Safety lies, 'Tis better to be Ignorant than Wise. [Exeunt Ad. Cim. Enter Roderick. Roder.] Art thou that Rodomond, victorious Rodomond, Whom this illustrious Day so glorious saw, And now so abject and forlorn? Rodo.] I am that Wretch, whom proud Ravenna saw This Day triumphant, like a God ador'd, Now in a few revolving Hours o'rethrown, And levell'd with the Herd of Men. Roder.] When Fortune or the Gods afflict Mankind, Compassion to the Miserable's due; But when we suffer what we may prevent, At once we forfeit Pity and Esteem. Rodo.] Am I so fall'n? so miserably lost? To be below, or not at least deserve The Pity of my Friend? Roder.] Would my Compassion could your State restore; You only to your self can Pity shew: Rouze, rouze, my Lord; exert that God-like Mind, And, shaking of this Lethargy of Love, Be Man again: Then all the past will like a Vision seem, Whose Image's confus'd, perplex the Brain, And with convulsive Terrors fright the Mind; But when the chearful Morn calls up the Day, We wake with Joy, to find it but a Dream. Rodo.] Would'st thou perswade me to infringe my Faith, Renounce my Honour, and betray my Love? That noble Passion which the Soul refines, First made Men Heroes, and those Heroes Gods; Whose genial Fires inform the sluggish Mass, The Rugged soften, and the Timerous warm, Give Wit to Fools, and Manners to the Clown: The rest of Life is an ignoble Calm; The Soul unmov'd by Love's inspiring Breath, Like lazy Waters, stagnates and corrupts. Roder.] Mistaken Notions, of mistaken Good, Your captive Reason led astray: The Brave Shou'd scorn the Snares of that deluding Sex, Nor sacrifice to such a Toy as Woman, Their Int'rest, their Happiness and Fame; With Women always they most Favour find, Who have the least of Merit. Rodo.] The bright Armida, her whole Sex transcends, As much in Vertue as in Beauty: O, my Friend, Tear not those Wounds, which thou shou'dst rather heal: Gonzalvo try'd just now, but try'd in vain, Advice to wretched Lovers is the same, As Drops of Water cast on conquering Flame, Which add new Fury to their native Rage: This Night I am resolv'd to wed Armida. Roder.] By Heav'n you must not. Rodo.] By all that's sacred, Roderick, I will; Thy Perseverance to resist my Love, Will disunite our Friendship. Rod.] I'm more your Friend than you are to your self. But see the King. Enter King, Gonz. Mal. Mer. Eu. King.] Unhappy Youth, whom I wou'd save in vain, Thou much has wrong'd my Honour and my Love. Rod.] When Rodomond is guilty of that Crime, The King and Heav'n avenge. King.] Attend with Patience, while I show Thy black Ingratitude. Rodo.] O Royal Almerick. King.] With Silence first hear me, let all rerire. [Exe' ceteri. Did I not snatcht thee from the Jaws of Fate, When Gondibert, thy vanquisht Father lay Extended on the Ground? Then, thou, by Law Of Nations, and of Arms became my Slave, For Conquest is the first and noblest Title: Have I not since, with a Paternal Care, Indulg'd, and bred thy Youth? And, from a Slave, Thy Hopes to Empire rais'd, and my Cimene, A Gift of nobler Value than a Crown. Rodo.] You gave me Life when Death was all my Wish, Tho' Benefits upbraided are dissolv'd, I own The mighty Sum. King.] Must thou not blush those Benefits to own, Thou wantest Gratitude to repay? Adopted thus, and in my Bosom worn, Thou sting'st that Breast, whose Warmth thy Life maintain'd. Of all the Sex there was one beauteous Maid, Whose Eyes in triumph lead my vanquish'd Soul, Whom I design'd of my declining Years To sooth the Cares, and ease the Weight of Crowns, Her thou hast ravish'd from me. Rodo.] Forgetful King, survey your swelling Stream, Stain'd with the hostile Blood that I have shed, Thy Enemies Blood, thy Glory and thy Crown, Both by this Sword secur'd; thus have I paid The Debt I owe—But for Armida's Love, To God, and Men, I will avow my Claim; By Nature's Laws, and common Right I hold As first Possessor, my Armidia's Heart. King.] Insolent young Man, thou know'st not sure I want no Power to chastize thy Folly. Rod.] You may chastize, and I resign my Head, I yield my Life, but never can Armida's. King.] No longer, Rodomond, trifle with my Love, Thou know'st the gentle Temper of my Soul, Which the mistaken World, good Nature call; Tho' easie to be rais'd, more easie to be calm'd. Like Heaven's Anger, my relenting Rage Begins in Tempests, and is laid by Showers, The swelling Drops burst thro' their lucid Orbs, And chase each other down my flowing Cheeks, Which blush with Shame, at the old Soldier's Weakness, I weep for thee, whom I would save from Ruin. Rod.] Those moving Tears will quite dissolve my Frame, They melt that Soul, that Threats could never shake; My King, my Father, sheath that generous Sword In this ungrateful Heart, I dying leave What living I can never lose; Then, then, Armidia's yours. King.] No, live, my Rodomond, restor'd to all That Empire, Fortune, or the King can give, Accept my Daughter, and resign my Mistress. Rodo.] You may as well these impious Hands command To tear the Strings which hold my panting Heart; And sooner I'd obey. King.] Like Whirlwinds then, I blow thee from my Soul, The World's Extreams divide us two for ever: Submit, for thy Refusal, is thy Fate. [Exit King. Enter at the other Door, Adel. Cimene. Armi. Roz. Euphel, disguis'd. Adel.] All is prepared to solemnize our Nuptials, The Priest attends in yonder Mytle-grove, To tye the sacred Knot. Rodo.] This Minute's ours, beyond the Power of Fate, Let Fortune rage to Morrow, and destroy, We shall have Ages liv'd to Day. [Takes Arm. by the Hand. Lead on my Friend: Arm.] Unusual Weight hangs on my labouring Soul, Presaging inauspicious Joys. As they are going out, Enter Albazor, Meroan, and Guards. Alb.] My Lords, you are my Prisoners; I must demand your Swords. Rodo.] My Sword, Albazor! Alb.] It is the King's Command, that I Convey you Prisoners to the Citadel. Draw, draw, my Lord, and let us die like Men. [Adel. draws. Rodo.] Put up, my Friend, the King's Commands are sacred. My Passion had almost surpriz'd my Virtue; Here, take my useless Sword, so often drawn In Almerick's Defence. [Flings his Sword. Arm.] O Rodomond! Cim.] Unhappy Adelan. Rodo.] To die, is nothing but to cease from Pain, For all the Shade and Darkness of the Grave, Is to be sever'd from Armida's Eyes; That, that's the last convulsive Gasp, The Separation of the Soul and Body; Adieu, my Love. [To Armi. Arm.] O Rodomond! how can I bear those killing Words, Stay till my Sighs and Prayers make Heav'n relent To Pity, and reverse thy Fate, thy cruel Fate, The Guilt of every Star. Alb.] My Lords, your Time is short. Rod.] Ill boding, Reven-peace, nor dare prophane The sacred Rites of parting Love—Oh Armida! Must, must we thus divide? Arm.] No, no, like Life, I hold thee fast, Nor shall the Hand of Death unlock my Grasp. Rodo.] Thus claspt in Folds of everlasting Love, No Force can break the Circle of our Arms; But 'tis our Fate—Armida we must yield, Once more farewel, thou best of Womankind, If I stay longer, I shall never go; Lead on to Dungeons, Horrors, Chains and Death, The Brave and Honest never are surpriz'd; If there's a Life to come, the Good are blest, And if there's none all have eternal Rest. [Exeunt. Manent Arm. Cim. Cim.] Stunn'd with this Shock, my Grief forgot to flow, But now with double Violence breaks forth. [Weeps. Arm.] The Sea, Cimene, cannot find us Brine To feed the Tears proportion'd to these Woes, I can no longer bear the sight of Heaven, Cords, Daggers, Poisons shall thy Life dispatch, Which Grief too slowly will destroy. Cim.] That impious Help, Armida, we shou'd scorn, To kill this Wretch, there is no need of Art, Whoever lives like me, can break her Heart. Exeunt. Scene II. Enter Mal. Mero. Mal.] The noble Lyon's hunted to the Toil, There let him foam, and roar and gnaw the Chain, Which he shall never break. Mer.] The King this Minute has pronounc'd his Doom, To lose his Head to Morrow in the Forum. Mal.] The King's so fickle and unfixt in Temper, There's no depending on his Sentance; To Day condemns, to Morrow will forgive; 'Tis good to be secure; Are all to mount the Guard To Night, our Friends? Mer.] Your Creatures all in every Post of Trust. Mal.] Good Meroan, go see that all's secure, The Time approaches to reward thy Service. [Exit Mero. Mal. Solus. What is Ambition but Desire of Greatness? And what is Greatness but Extent of Power? If Power then's the Object of my Wish, I vainly seek, what I possess already; A Crown can give me nothing that I want, Since I have all the Good, tho' not the Name; But Lust of Power's a Dropsie of the Mind, Whose Thirst increases, while we drink to quench it, 'Till swoln, and stretcht by the repeated Draught, We burst, and perish. Enter Albazar. Alb.] May all your Fortune thus, my Lord, succeed, May all your Foes the Fate of Rodomond meet, Like him secur'd, and in your Power. Mal.] To Morrow's Sun his headless Trunk beholds; Then, then, Albazar, we will seize our Wishes, The Spoils of Empire, and the Charms of Love. Alb.] I beg, my Lord, you wou'd vouchsafe one Boon: Bestow on me Euphelia. Mal.] I am engag'd to Meroan. Alb.] Engag'd, my Lord? Mal.] Yes, Albazar, he has that Favour askt, And I have past my Word; but be content, There will be Spoil to gratifie thy Wishes. Alb.] I long have lov'd that beauteous Maid: Methinks, My Lord, my Services shou'd not be weigh'd With Meroan's. Mal.] I am engag'd, and never will recede; You must submit; whoever thinks His Services unpaid, will soon repent them. [Exit. Alb.] If so imperious while he only hopes, How will he swell when Master of a Crown? He shall repent it. Enter King, Gonz. Roder. &amp;c. King.] Tho' Royal Blood flows in thy Noble Veins, And forty Camps with Lawrels plant thy Brows, Thy Son's Presumption merits Death, Gonzalvo; He is not worthy of my Crown and Daughter. Gonz.] O, Sir, forgive the Folly of his Love; I never did support, nor knew his Passion: If Services, tho' past, may Mercy claim, At once my Age commiserate, and his Youth. King.] His Doom be chang'd within Ravenna's Walls; If found to Morrow, he shall dye. Enter Armida. Arm.] I come, unhappy King, to save thy Guilt, Whose fatal Love thy Reason has misled, To pass a Sentence, that will shake thy Throne, Destroy thy Honour, and thy Peace. King.] Blame not Armida, what these Eyes have forc'd: You might have hinder'd what you now deplore, By condescending to my Love; and you Can only now retrieve his Fate. Arm.] I will revenge your Quarrel on these Eyes, Whose inauspicious Charms have thus destroy'd The King, my self, and what I hold more dear: I will retire excluded from the World; I never more my Rodomond will see, Wou'd you his Life preserve and Liberty restore. King.] You to your self can your own Wishes grant; Give me that Hand, and Rodomond shall live. Arm.] To save my Lover's, and my Brother's Life, I will my Hopes of Happiness resign, But cannot change the Object of my Love; Consum'd to Ashes in the fragrant Nest, My Phœnix Passion nobly shall expire, But ne're revive the Species to renew. King.] Thy Coldness kills not, but preserves my Flame, As Winter Snows the freezing North defend, And tender Plants keep warm. O Armida! Thy very Cruelty has all the Charm That Kindness gives the rest of Womankind; Disdain'd we still love on. Arm.] Your Passion only centers in your self, Or you wou'd wretched be, to make me blest; Wou'd to my Happiness devote your own, In generous Friendship, and sublimer Love, That part of Bliss is least which we receive, The nobler Pleasure springs from what we give. King.] Return Armida, to behold thy Fate: [Is going. Here, Malespine, my Royal Signet take, The Warrant of his Death; go see The Sentence executed strait. Arm.] Hold, hold, inhuman Tyrant, hold; Canst thou consent to take that precious Life, Whose Loss will leave no Vertue among Men? King.] 'Tis fixt as Fate, and never can be chang'd; You may these Words remember. [Going. Arm.] I yield, I yield: Here, take the curs'd Armida, To save my Rodomond, I will live another's: Be doom'd to Life more terrible than Death. King.] Armida yields; Gonzalvo, Malespine, Albazar, Partake the Joy; I want the Strength to bear To either Pole: Let Seas and Winds convey The welcome Sound, and all Mankind be happy: A thousand manumitted Slaves shall owe Their Freedom to this Day; shall ever bless The happy Hour Armida saw the Light. Thou shining Excellence, thou best of Women, [To Arm. I leave thee to dispel these gloomy Clouds, And to assume a brighter Face of Joy: Prepare, Armida, for this glorious Night; In all my Triumphs thou shalt bear a part, Divide my Scepter, and Possess my Heart. Manent Giv. Arm. [Ex. Kin. Mal. Roder. &amp;c. Arm.] Recal the King, for I recal my Word; I cannot, will not, must not keep it: But then My Rodomond dies; I will, I will; I will be miserable, O my Father; I cannot bear this mighty Weight of Woe; Thou never more must see thy wretched Daughter. Gon.] The Gods thus punish your intemperate Love. Arm.] My Flame is virtuous, innocent, and pure, And rather claims Protection. Gon.] All Passions in excess are Crimes; Submit thy Fate to Heaven's indulgent Care, Tho' all seem lost, 'tis impious to despair; The Tracts of Providence like Rivers wind, Here run before us, then retreat behind, And tho' immerg'd in Earth from human Eyes, Again break forth, and more conspicuous rise. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. Consorts of Musick, Shouts and Acclamations at distance. Enter Mal. Alb. Mer. Mal.] We stand, Albazar, on the Brink of Fate, The next Advance we step into a Throne, Or fall for ever. [Shouts at distance. These Shouts are mine. Thou thoughtless King, dream of imagin'd Joys, Which thou shalt never taste, thy Crown sits loose, And ready for this Head. Mer.] The King intends Prince Rodomond to release, When in possession of his Love, we must Anticipate that Design, or all is lost. Mal.] 'Tis true, that thought necessitates our haste; Albazar, shall the Citadel secure, Then strangle Rodomond, while we Disarm the King, and make him Prisoner: Our Friends, I hope, are ready? Alb.] They only wait the Signal. Mal.] Each to his Charge, with Care and Caution move, And nothing Leave to Fortune, Who never trusts, can never be deceiv'd; For Fortune still in our own Power lies, She governs Fools, is govern'd by the Wise. [Exit. Scene opens and discovers Armida drest like a Bride, Eup. attending. Arm.] Ye radiant Galaxies of blended Stars, Whose Influence governs Mortals here below, Among that numerous and cœlestial Host, Has poor Armida not one Friend? Are Bears And Lyons only Rulers of the Skies, And not one Lover in that shining Throng? Eup.] Despair not, Madam, Time these Griefs will cure; Time dries the sighing Widow's Eyes, and makes The Wretch in Bondage, in Chains forget That ever he was happy. Arm.] There is no Cure for this immortal Grief: To Night, Euphelia, I must wed the King. The Thought distracts, and fills my Soul with Horrour. But I'll anticipate my Doom; I'll be his Bride, But never will his Wife. Give me the Draught, I have prepar'd, Euphelia. Eup.] O rush not headlong to Despair. I now must disobey you. Arm.] Dispute not my Command. Eup.] Then let me Pledge, and with my Mistress Die. Arm.] No, live Euphelia, to defend my Fame, From rude Aspersions of malicious Tongues. [Exit Eup. To save my Lover, and to save my Self, I drink this healing Draught; Armida dead, The King relents, and Rodomond restores. Enter Eup. with a Cup, Arm. takes it, drinks. Here's to immortal Love; 'tis Rodomond's Health. Euphelia, the noble Draught gives Life to him And Indolence to me: When After-ages read Our dismal Tale, Proverbial be our Names, In all the Legends, and Records of Love. Now, Almerick, come, I give my willing Hand; Lead to the Grave. Enter Cim. Roz. and Ladies. Be silent on thy Life, Euphelia. Cim.] The King commands us to attend your Nuptials. My Friend, Armida, now be comes my Mother; And that Affection which I shew'd before, I now convert to Duty. Arm.] Thy wretched Mother, since I bear that Name, Shall know Cimene only as her Friend; No other Title can unite our Hearts. Enter King as a Bridegroom. Mal. Alb. Roder. &amp;c. King.] Keep down my Joys, compress your rapid Stream, And slow as gentle as you'r Deep; Thy Hand, my Love. Arm.] Some leprous Scurf this wretched Hand defile, And make it loathsom to thy Touch and Sight; And wilt thou then, inhuman King, thus force My Virgin-heart, and ravish my Desires. King.] This Rage, Armida, misbecomes the Night, But Time will make us better Friends: Lead to the Temple. As they proceed, enter running Gon. Ir. kneel to the King. Gon.] Hold, Royal Almerick, hold, you press your Fate; I must forbid these horrid Nuptials. King.] What means Gonzalvo? Gon.] With frightful Incest you pollute your Soul; Armida is your Daughter. King.] Thou sure art mad, Gonzalvo? Gon.] My Wife Irene, will unfold the Secret. Ir.] By Heav'n 'tis true. King.] Speak, frantick Woman. Ir.] O first forgive, forgive my fatal Folly, 'Tis I have thus deceiv'd the World and You. King.] Speak, undeceive, and kill; I will have Patience if I can. Ir.] When you, great Almerick, with conquering Arms Our Lombardy o'rerun, and laid our Cities waste, The good Queen Emmeline, the Wife of Gondibert, Committed to my Charge her only Daughter, The Sister of Prince Rodomond; I had a Daughter of an equal Age, Who dying soon, I bred the Princess as my own, And gave her the same Name; My Lord Gonzalvo then three Years was absent, In the Wars, and nothing knew of what had past, But thought the Princess dead, and that Our Daughter liv'd; for so I had deceiv'd him. When you became our King, and had receiv'd My Lord unto your Friendship, you also gave Your only Daughter of the same Age, and Call'd Cimene, to my Care; I, out of Affection to the Royal House of Gondibert, exchang'd the Children, Gave you the Daughter of King Gondibert, And bred up yours as mine; there she stands, Miscall'd Armida, but is true Cimene. King.] Then Cimene is the true Armida, And Armida is the true Cimene? Ir.] By all that's sacred it is true. King.] Why did'st thou sooner not reveal it? Ir.] My Fear restrain'd me 'till this fatal Minute: Necessity compell'd, thus to prevent your Incest. King.] Why not to thy Husband? Gonz.] I was in Ignorance, 'till this Moment. Ir.] I knew the Niceness of his Honour would not Permit that Imposition on the King. King.] By Heav'n 'tis false; 'tis Combination all, To rob me of my Love, thou wretched Woman; Thy Sex, nor Age, nor Quality, shall protect From my just Anger, thy devoted Head. Ir.] O, Sir, like Heav'n, the Penitent forgive. King.] I lose a Daughter, and a Daughter find; But where's my Mistress? O, Irene, Revoke thy Tale; thy horrid Tale, Irene; Say, that through Dotage thou hast idly dreamt, And I will yet forgive. Ir.] The Truth I speak, I must to Death defend. Gon.] 'Tis true, most certainly true: Reflect, great Sir, and you perhaps may trace The Mother's Image in the beauteous Daughter. King.] Ha, Gonzalvo, thou hast. [Looks stedfastly on her. Rouz'd such a Thought. As will destroy. I see, I see My charming Wife, my Clarismunda there; When Beauty's Bloom hung on her blushing Cheeks, And all the Royal Youth in shining Arms Fought for her Love like Empire. Arm.] O see the Care of Heaven, whose Instinct arm'd My boading Heart, against my Father's Love: Here were a Dawn of Happiness, but I Have thrown that Happiness away: You still Are Daughter to a King Armida. Cim.] For Friendship-sake I love the very Name, And am with pleasure call'd Armida. King.] Indulgent Gods due Warning give, But humane Blindness oft prevents their Care. Last Night, Cimene, when my Love relax'd, Permitted Slumber to invade these Eyes, Methought I saw thy beauteous Mother stand In her own Form, confest before my sight, And with that Voice, which every Ear cou'd charm, Thus cry aloud, Cease, wretched Almerick, cease, And check thy impious Love; which, if indulg'd, Will fill thy Soul with everlasting Horrour: I starting, wak'd, and nothing found but Air; But when my Reason had resum'd its place, I scorn'd the foolish Dream, as only bred From melancholy Vapours. Gon.] It surely was the Voice of Heav'n. King.] On what a horrid Precipice I stood, Whence, falling headlong, I had dash'd to pieces; For ever broke the Quiet of my Soul; In how perplext a Maze of Error thou Has thus intangled us, Irene? But I Forgive thy Folly: O Cimene! Oh, my Daughter. A Father thus may sure embrace a Daughter. [Embraces. Begone, begone; thy Lips are much too warm. [Starts. O fly, my Child, for ever from these Eyes; Too weak my Vertue, and my Love too strong. Pauses and Sighs. Approach, Cimene, now the Danger's past; In that one Sigh, my Love and Life expire: 'Tis true, I lov'd with more than Father's Love; But all my Passion cou'd inspire before, Affection now shall equal: Fly, Malespine, And bring Prince Rodomond: This Night I make my Daughter happy. Arm.] Oh, I never can be happy: What has my Folly done. Mal.] I must disguise no longer; he cannot come. King.] Ha! cannot come. Mal.] He shall not come. King.] What means the Slave? Mal.] This Minute he is strangled. King.] The Gods forbid. How? Where? Mal.] By my Command, unthinking Almerick: Thou gav'st thy Power to me, and Power Makes Kings; I think not proper to refund it. Arm.] O Heavens! [Swoons. King.] The Villain raves; seize him, Gonzalvo. Mal.] Seize me? The Pageant King shall first be seiz'd. Stamps with his Feet, arm'd Men rush in. Look, Almerick, behold these Swords are mine: [Party draws. Disarm Gonzalvo, Roderick, and his Friends, This Day I mount thy Throne. King.] Flagitious Villain, I cannot fear, So much Amazement has possest my Soul. Look, Monster, if thou canst on me, and Heav'n: Have I not pour'd on thee continual Streams Of Bounty and of Favour, with Titles grac'd, And made thee, Miscreant, Kinsman to the Throne, With Honours loaded that ingrateful Head, 'Till over-charg'd, thou bent'st beneath the Weight; What coud'st thou ask, and went'st repulst away? I granted all Ambition could devour, Or thy own Averice demand! This Hand! This unexhausted Hand! still gave and gave, 'Till thou seem'd satiated with the vast Receipt, But I unsatiated with giving. Is this Then the Return of all? Mal.] The sole Return of boundless Favour; You gave so long, till I cou'd not repay; But talk no more, the Repetition's vain, To you disgustful, troublesome to me. Gon.] Let us resolve to die, 'tis worse than Death, But to survive this Day the poison'd Air Must be contagious, which that Monster draws. Mal.] Take that preaching Fool away. Kin.] First hear me speak, but not to thee again, I see my Soldiers, nay my Guards thy Slaves, [To the Soldiers. Have I not fed your Hunger, cloath'd your Wants, To Conquest led you, and to glorious Spoils, Indulg'd your Riot? Like my Children, nurst In Wantonness and Ease? Can you revolt? A Soldier's Honour's dearer than his Life; Can Gold corrupt you to betray your Master? Dogs on their Feeders fawn, but Men betray. I see that the Defection's universal. Shouts without, A Mal. a Mal. a Mal. Mal. Away with the Prisoners, I'll hear no more. [Exit. As they are going out, Mal. stops Cimene. Manent Mal. Cim. Arm. Aler. Mal.] One Word before you go. Cim.] With me, thou Monster. Mal.] Since you appear the Daughter of the King, I want your Title to confirm my Throne; I once design'd that Lady for my Bed, But she despis'd, and I despise again. Arm.] Thy Impudence surmounts thy other Crimes, To hope my Love, thou execrable Wretch. Seest not the Lightning in the Hand of Jove Prepar'd to flash, and to transfix thy Soul. Mal.] Rave, rave on, till sleeping Gods awake. Arm.] There are no Gods, if thou this Night survive. Mal.] Kind Nature has not form'd my manly Mind To sooth, to fawn and flatter, wretched Woman; I know the Charter of my Sex; I know How Kings shou'd be obey'd; all Right began In force to Love, and Empire the first Claim: But I will give you back the Crown I take, And so compensate for the Father's Loss. Arm.] Give me thy Crown, thou greater Fool than Villain; What height of Madness can indulge thy Love, Stain'd with the Heroe's Blood whom I adore, And vile Possession of my Father's Crown? Cim.] Thou poor Usurper of a Moment's Greatness, Who hast no other Title but thy Crimes. Mal.] Neglected Beauty may have leave to rail; You, Madam, have more reason to be kind; I own I cannot yet despair: They say, Affected Anger is a sign of Love; My long Experience of your Sex supports The Vanity of that Thought. Arm.] Insolent insulting Villain! Mal.] That very Rage is not without its Charms. Arm.] Come, let us fly, Armida. Mal.] First hear your Doom: I go this Minute to dispatch the King; Then drag thee to my Bed, and tye thee to my Throne. Arm.] O hear me, Malespire, if thou art a Man, And Nature is not totally defac'd; Grant me but one Request, Let me behold, For once, my Father's Eyes, before that Hand Has clos'd their Lids in endless Night: Grant this, I ask no more. Mal.] The first Request a Lover ought to grant; Next, grant thou mine; Conduct the Princess, Meroan. [Exeunt Cim. Ar. Mer. So Meron has seiz'd his Prey. [Shrieking without. Thus have I rowl'd my Fortunes up the Hill; But must provide with Care, lest they revolve: Had I miscarry'd, I had been a Villain; For Men judge Actions always by Events; But when we mannage with a just Foresight, Success is Prudence, and Possession Right. [Exit. SCENE III. Changes to a Prison in the Palace. A dim Taper burning. King, Gonzalvo. King.] We dream, Gonzalvo, sure some Form of Night, Some ghastly Phantasm plays before our Eyes; Or is't that Weight which rids the labouring Breast From Vapours, Fumes and Indignation bred? This horrid Scene cannot be true; I rose Bright as the Sun to Day; like him ador'd With all the Pomp and Splendor of a Crown; Now in a Dungeon cast, like vilest Slaves; Condemn'd for Crimes to ignominious Death; The Sun will rise again, bring back the Day, But we are set for ever. Gonz.] We always dream the Life of Man's a Dream, In which fresh Tumults agitate his Breast, Till the kind Hand of Death unbolts the Bars Which clogg'd the noble and aspiring Soul; Then, then, we truly wake. King.] I cou'd submit to arbitrary Gods, With Patience bear my wretched Doom, Gonzalvo, Had Heav'n punish'd by another Hand, But from my Slave, my Creature, I have rais'd To Dignities and Trust; 'tis more Then Nature can support. Gonz.] You knew he first King Gondibert betray'd, Yet you receiv'd the Villain to your Breast. King.] Upbraid no more my Weakness: What's to be done? Gon.] There's nothing left but Death. King.] How shall we dye? The Monster's not so kind To leave us Instruments of Death. Gon.] Those friendly Walls will our dash'd Brains receive: By Resolution Death his easie found. But fear not, wretched King; he will take care We shall not live too long. [King gropes, feels the Walls. King.] These Ribs of Flint are hard; but not so hard As that remorsless Villain's Heart: The Weight Of Greif my Spirits sinks; here will I lye In expectation of our Doom. [Lies down. Enter Cimene. Cim.] I come to seal my wretched Father's Eyes, And then to close my own. O my Father. [Kneels over him. This Moment found, and the same Moment lost; My proper Griefs are drown'd and sunk in yours. King.] My fatal Passion has destroy'd us all, My Daughter, Rodomond, and my self; Forgive me, dear Cimene. Arm.] O mention that no more; prepare to die, The Tyrant has pronounc'd your Doom. King.] Thou bring'st me Comfort; 'tis my Wish, Cimene: But how got'st thou admittance? Arm.] The Price of that audacious Monster's Love, Who has presum'd to court me; nay, more, The barbarous Meroan has this Minute seiz'd My poor Euphelia, while Heav'n lookt on, And, without helping, saw the ravisht Maid. King.] By Heav'n he dares not, Malespine not dares [King starting up. To harbour such a Thought: These Hands shall first Thy tender Life destroy. Arm.] O fear not me, I am prepar'd to go; I wait on you, my Rodomond, to meet. Door opens, enter Mal. Mer. with a Cup. Mal.] If the distrest to Death for Refuge fly, I am your Friend, and come to ease your Pain. King.] I thank thee, Malespine, I never thought To be oblig'd to thee. Give me the Cup: [Takes the Cup. It must be surely mortal from thy Hand; Divine Nepenthe, Liquor of the Gods, Which their eternal Vigour shall supply, And verdant Youth renews; but touch'd by thee, Wou'd turn to rankest Poyson. Here, Gonzalvo. To thee and Liberty I Drink. Enter Messenger frightned. Mess.] Lost, lost, my Lord, for ever. King going to drink, stops. Mal.] Why tremblest so, thou Slave? Thy Fear Has kill'd the Man, and sent thy Ghost to fright me. Speak, Scriech-owl, speak. Mess.] The false Albazar has betray'd you; Instead of executing your Commands, Has set Prince Rodomond and Adelan free, Who, with drawn Swords, strait marching to the Forum, Rais'd all the Citizens to Arms, to save the King: Your Friends make head, but all in vain, Are overborn by the tumultious Crowd; Who now enrag'd, approach the Palace. Mal.] O faithless Dog, thus to destroy my Hopes. Draw, Meron, there is no thought of Life; But we may dye reveng'd. Draws, makes at the King, who flings down the Cup. King.] Here is a Dawn of Life; My Empire for a Sword: Fight with thy Teeth, Gonzalvo. King retires round the Stage, pursu'd by Mal. Cim. lays hold of Mal. Arm.] Repent, repent, and yet be pardon'd. Mer.] Hah, is it so? Noise without, Save, save the King. Clashing of Swords. Then I will save my self. [Disarms Mal. and leaps on him. Mal.] Now I am a Villain. Enter Rodom. Ad. Tancr. Citizens, &amp;c. Arm.] My Rodomond lives. Rod.] Cimene lives, the King is safe. King.] O Rodomond, forgive me first my Crime, Before I dare behold thy Face. Rod.] You know no Crime, and I have felt no Pain: The present Joy defaces all that's past. King.] The Gods this Night, have thro' such Mazes led Our stumbling Steps as will thy Soul surprize. Rod.] Albazor has the wondrous Secret told, To whose Repentance we our Safeties owe. King.] First, Let us Pay what injur'd Justice claims, And then, reward thy Love: Thou horned Monster, [To Mal. 'Tis more than Cruelty to let thee live; The Villain's Conscience is his greatest Pain; In Mercy thou shalt dye: Drag hence the Slave To Caldrons, Racks, and Wheels, stretch evr'y Nerve, And every Gristle break: Thou injur'd King, O, Gondibert look down, and see my Justice; This Monster first his Faith to thee betray'd, Then me: I send this Victim to thy Ghost, And let us now be Friends. Mal.] Excuses wou'd be vain; I brave my Fate, And only with Dissatisfaction dye, That I am not reveng'd. [Exit to Tortures. King.] Away with him. Albazar, Meroan, your Services to Night Obliterate your Crimes before. Now, Rodomond, Here take the Mistress you so long have serv'd; May all your Joys but equal your Desert, And the good Gods can give no more. [Gives Arm. hand. Rodo.] Let me contain the mighty Joy. No more Armida, but my Wife Cimene. [To Arm. No more Cimene, but my dearest Sister. [To Cim. Arm.] O, Rodomond, resistless Fate divides us; Tho' all the Bars between us seem remov'd, I never can be yours; to Night I dye; Three Hours of Life, and then I am no more. Rod.] The Care of Heav'n forbid; What means Cimene? Arm.] Despairing to be happy in thy Love, And to prevent my Marriage with the King, I drank a Draught of Poyson. Rod.] O Horrour! Horrour! can this be true? Arm.] As true as I love Rodomond Rod.] Eternal Fury will distract my Soul; I cannot live to see that cursed Moment: I shew thee thus the Way to die, Cimene. [Draws his Sword. King.] Disarm his Rage: Call strait for Help of Art: Whoever saves my Daughter's precious Life, My Empire shall reward. Arm.] In vain is Art, the Aconite works sure, Whose mortal Cold congeals the Blood, And freezes all the Springs of Life. Rod.] Was ever such a Fate, mysterious Powers? The Storm blown o're, to perish in the Port, In sight of all our Wishes. King.] What has Passion done, unhappy Maid? Arm.] My Father found, my Father kind, My Lover safe, and given to my Arms, Must poor Cimene die? [Enter Euph. running. Eup.] I have escap'd the lustful Villain's Hands. Arm.] Thou com'st in time to close my Eyes, Euphelia; Who art a Witness of the fatal Draught. Eup.] Then live, my Princess, for you are not poyson'd; I disobey'd your rash Command; exchang'd The mortal Drugs you had prepar'd, and gave A harmless Liquor only. Arm.] May I believe you? Can this be true? Eup.] As I would die, to save my dearest Mistress. Arm.] Then, then I'll live, live to reward Thy faithful Care, Euphelia. O Rodomond! Rod.] For ever blest Euphelia, be thy Tongue, Too weak is Man this Rapture to sustain. I shall dye with Transport. My Grief, repell'd by Extasie of Joy, The jarring Tides will overflow my Heart. King.] Once more I give my Daughter to thy Arms, And with her Hand my Crown. Rod.] With Adoration I receive the Blessing; And since propitious Powers our Joys compleat, 'Tis just my Friend and Sister shou'd partake. I have a Right now to bestow this Hand: [Takes Arm. Hand. Here, generous Adelan, let your Sorrows cease. Our Hopes, our Joys, our Interest are the same; Here, take my Sister, and divide my Throne. King.] Our Thanks first paid for this miraculous Night, To bounteous Gods, who have these Wonders wrought, To Morrow's Sun your Nuptials shall adorn, And see thee mounted on thy Father's Throne, While I my Age in downy Quiet lull: By my Misfortunes, Rodomond, be wise, And chuse with Care to whom you give the Reins; In this one Point be to thy self so just, Reward the useful Villain, never trust.
