      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Duke from war, in Tryumph, leading in his hand Artabella, a woman of that Countrey, from whence he came with Arbatus her Brother, and Zoranzo Prisoner, and on the other side Amphelia and Ortellus and Guard. Duke. Madam I need not say you're welcome to this Countrey since 'tis mine. Artab. Sir, leaving my own for yours, speaks my beleif of that and all thing else you say. Duke. The same unto your worthy Brother Besides my thanks to you Sir for letting Your Sister take this Journey. Arbat. Your Highness hath so Nobly Exprest Your self unto my Sister, that I Consented to her Coming with you, so Highly I esteem'd your Princely word, That I have let her Trespass on the Bound of Common Modesty in this Adventure, for when this hasty Judging World shall see you have brought a woman From her'owne Country and not your Wife, how soon will every Tongue give her Another title. Duke. Sir my suddain Actions shall prevent all Tongues or thoughts either to name or Thinke her any thing but my Dutchesse, Therefore all that owe Duty or Respect To me, pay it to her. What Amphelia did you beleive the world So Barren of good Faces, that yours Only dos enrich it, or did you think 'twas All mens fates only to Doat on yours. Look on this Lady and you'l see your Errour, marke well her face and you Will find in every line Beauty sits Empress there, These are the Eyes Amphelia now, that dart obedience Through my heart, are not you vext To see I am noe Constant foole and Love you still. Amphe. Vext at what, to see a man I hate; Love another, a very great vexation: Know Sir this Breast has only Roome for Joy and Love, to brave Ortellus, Forgive my heart that 'twas not Yours before, since you have long Deserv'd it. Ortell. Madam, no time was long enough To wait this Blessed hour. Amphe. Alas great Duke instead of pineing. For your Change, you find me Mid'st a Thousand Joys in this New Choice. Duke. So you doe me Amphelia, amid'st Ten Thousand; Not all the Glories that attend a Conquering Souldier can create one Joy so great In me as being Conquer'd here in My owne Tryumphs. I am but a slave. Nor dos my victory over Thousands please Me so much as being overcome by One, by this fair one, whose Eyes By shining on my Tryumphs only Make it Glorious. Amphe. Well Sir we will not change our happy States; you cannot brag of happyness So great to make me Envy, I am Only sorry for this Lady that had nothing Else to doe with her heart but to give It you: Madam if your Breast had Been Crowded with some Twenty or Thirty hearts, and amongst these one very Ill, you might have made present of That to this mighty Duke. Duke. Madam does not this Ladies discourse Make you affraid of me. Artab. Not in the least Sir. Duke. Where's this bold Prisoner. Guard. Here and please your Highness. Duke. Well Sir, though you did attempt to Kill me In our Camp after you were our Prisoner You shall not dye, since you are of the Same Country this Lady is, Therefore Thank her and Fortune for your Life. Zo. I'de sooner Curse them both, shall I thank Any for my life but heaven that gave It me, I'de rather give it to a Cat, a Noble Death were far more welcome To me, then a mean Life at second Hand, my being here I owe unto the Gods when they think fit to lend it Me no longer, they know the way To take it from me, I scorn to run In debt unto a Mortal Duke, for two Or three dayes Breath. Amphe. Brave Captiveâ (aside) Duke. You're very high considering you Are in Chaines. Zo. Why Sir think you these Fetters can Confine my mind as they doe my Leggs, Or that my Tongue's your Prisoner, And dares only say may it please your Highness. How much are you mistaken: Know Sir my Soul is Prompter to my Tongue; And gives it Courage to say any thing, That Heaven will not frown at we shou'd Detract from those great pow'rs above, if We pay feares to any here below, perhaps You think, I'le beg my life now upon A pair of bent Petitioning knees. No Sir Had I a hundred lives, I'de give them all To sharpest Deaths, rather then Beg for one; Duke. You'r well-resolv'd, perhaps your mind May alter, when you see the Ax. In the mean time Commit him to the Closest Prison, where if you have any Accounts with heaven, you'l have time To Cast them up before your Death. Zo. Your Sentence brings me Joy; welcome The Keenest Ax that can be set, 'twill Cut my Head and Chaines both off together. Welcome most happy stroak, since it Will bring rest to my Eyes, and make A Slave a King.â Exit with Guard Duke. Madam I suppose this Journy has so Wearyed you, that 'tis time to shew you The way to your Lodgings, and leave you To your Repose. Guard. Make way there for the Duke, Amph. My Lord you had best Attend the Duke. Because 'tis a Respect due to him. Ortell. I shall Madam at your Commands. Exeunt Amphe. How has my tongue bely'd my too true Heart, in speaking hate unto the Duke and love to Ortellus. I hate the Duke, so Eyes do sleep that long have known No rest, how cou'd my Lips give passage, To such words and not have clos'd for ever. Not by my hearts direction I am sure, for That so swel'd being injur'd by my Mouth, as had not Pride and reason Kept It here from this unquiet seate, it wou'd Have forc't away to Archimedes Breast, And there have whisper'd to his heart my Tongues untruth. Why shou'd I love this Man, that shews me nothing but Contempt, And hate: Rouze drooping heart, and think Of that, think of it alwaies, so by degrees, 'Twill bring a Winter round thee, that in Time shall Chill the heate of thy undone And lost affections, oh 'tis not true that all our Sex Love Change, then I might find one Path that leades to it, that womanish vice, Were vertue now in me, 'twou'd free my Heart; and that were Charity. Enter Duke. See where he comes again, oh how I love And hate that man. Now help me Pride and fil My Breast with scorne, and prethee Tongue Take heed you do not faulter, heare not My heart that will distract thy speech, and So betray my fain'd unkindness. Duke. What Amphelia all alone, weary of your new Love already, cant you pass away the Time with him one Hour. Amphe. Were he no siner man then your self to Be with him a Minute, I shou'd think a Seaven Years pennance. Good heart lye still, and let my tongue alone. [aside. I wonder what a woman can see in you, Or heare from you, to make her Love you. I was Just goeing to have said, hate him. O what a taske is this, therefore let me Advise you to have a meane opinion Of your self. Duke. Me thinks that advise might serve for Your self ha, ha, ha. Amphe. Have patience heart I know I lye, thou Need'st not tell me so, I had better then Confess my Love. D'yee laugh Duke, faith So cou'd I at you till the tears ran down My Cheeks, that they wou'd quickly do, For griefe wou'd fain unload my Eyes. I must begon, I cannot longer Act this Part, unless I had a heart as hard as his. Duke. What you are goeing now to your Love Ortellus Amphe. I am so, and goeing from you to him is Pleasure double, not only pain to quit, But Joy to meet. Duke. Make hast then for your departure will Oblidge me too, so we shall be all pleas'd. Amphe. Hast I will make, but with unwilling feet. [aside. For every step from him my griefes repeat. [Exit. Duke. She's gon and after her my heart is flown, 'Tis well it has no Tongue to make it's mone; Then twou'd discover what my Pride conceales. A heart in Love (though slighted) Love reveales, Yet though I love her stil she shall not know. Her hate shall seem my Joy; which is my Woe. My constancy I'le Outwardly disguise. Though here within I am not half so wife, Yet rather then disclose my doating fate, I'le wound my heart by Counterfitting hate. To whine it wou'd the worst of Follies prove; Since women only pitty when they Love. With how much scorne she gave me welcome home? Ortellus in her hand to shew my Doome. Me and my Tryumphs she did so despise, As if they'd been unworthy of her Eyes. 'Tis well to her I shew'd as much disdain: I'de rather perish then she guess my pain. But O! the horrid Act she makes me do, To foole a woman that is young and true. So damn'd a Sin, that Hell cou'd not invent; It is to foul for any punnishment; To question those above I am afraid, Else I wou'd aske them why they woman made. Enter Philidor. O my Mad Cosen your Servant. Whether so fast? Phili. So fast Sir, why, I have been haunted By a Pack of Hounds this three Hours, And damn'd deep-Mouth'd Hounds too. No less then three Couple of Nurses. Three Couple of Plaguy hunting Bitches. And with them three Couple of Whelpes Alias Children Sir, they have Rung me Such a Ring this Morning through Every by turning that leads to a Bawdy House, I wisht my self Eartht a thousand Times, as a Fox does when he is hard Run, But that they wou'd have presently Damn'd me out with their Tongues. Duke. Faith Philidor t'is no news to me, for I Have known thee from sixteen at this Course of Life, what and these Children were All your Bastards, and their Nurses coming To dun you for money? Phill. Something of that's in't I think Sir. Duke. Well Cuz I'le leave thee to thy wildness, A fitter Companion much for thee then I at this time. Phill. Why Sir, I hope nothing has hapned to trouble you. Duke. No, No. My griefe alas is far beyond Express, To tell it to a friend can't make it less. [Exit. Phill. Wou'd I were at the wars again, I fear No Sword half so much as the Tongue Of one of these Nurses, and the youling of The Children are more dismall to my Eares, then the Groanes of Dyeing men in A Battaile, I am at this time in Law with Six or seaven Parishes about fathring Of Bastards, 'tis very fine truely, and yet me Thinks 'tis a hard Case, that I shou'd be Sued for Multiplying the world, since death Makes bold with Bastards as well as other Children, the very Picture of a Nurse and Child in her armes wou'd fright me now, Oh from that sightâdeliver me! Enter Nurse and Child as he is goeing out. Ha! and here they come: Pox on't what luck have I After saying my prayers, it shall be a fair Warning to me, now am I starred again, And must goe Run tother Course. [offers to Run away 1 Nurse. Esquire Philidor, Esquire Philidor. [she Runs after him. Phili. How deafe am I now, 'tis well I know This by way to avoid her. Enter second Nurse and meets him. Ha! S'death another, the Devill appearing Here too. 2. Nurse, O my Proper young squire, stay stay, d'ye hear sir, Phill. No indeed wo'nt I. Yet I know one way More to avoid them. Enter third Nurse. Ha! another coming here too, nay then I Find I am in Hell, before I thought I shou'd. What will become of me now? 3. Nurse. Oh Squire, I thought I shou'd never have Spoke with your Worship, Phili. No by this light shou'd you not if I cou'd have hope it. 1 Nurse. I wonder Squire at your Conscience to avoid Your pretty babes as you do. Phili. So, now't begins, I am like to have Sweet Musick from the Consort of These Nurses tongues. 1 Nurse. Saving your presence fir, I think Here are three as sweet Babes as ever suck'd Teat, and all born within the year too, Besides three more that your Worship has In our street. Phili. A very hopeful generation, sure this was A great Nut year; well if all Trades Fail, I may go into some Forraine Plantation where they want people, and Be well paid for my pains, wou'd I Were there now. 1 Nurse. Codge, Codge, dos a laugh upon a dad, In conscience sir the child knows your Worship. Phili. A very great comfort. 1 Nurse. My young Master here is as like your Worship, as e're he can look, has your Tempting eyes to a hair, I cou'd not Choose but smile to my self tother day, I was making him clean about the Secrets, to see what God had sent him In a plentifull manner, it put me half In mind of your Worship, I am sure I Have been at double the expence of Other Nurses in eating choice meat to Make my milk good for my young Master, because I wou'd not spoil the Groath of any one of his Members. 2 Nurse. Nay for that Neighbour, I have eat as Good or better meat then you every day In the week; I never toucht a bit of salt Meat, for fear of spoyling my childs Blood. Philli. Considering how well 'tis born. 3 Nurse. Nay Neighbours for that I have been At greater charge than either of you in Choice dyets, to breed good milk for My young Mistress here, 1 Nurse You Lye. 2 Nurse. You'r a Queane. 1 Nurse. And you'r a Whore. Marry your husband Is the notedst Cuckold in all our street. 2 Nurse. You lye you jade yours is a greater. Phili. Hisânow for a battail Royal. 1 Nurse.

Here is her Picture, Oh thou too like shade, To looke on it my Eyes are half afraid. It so presents my Joy and Misery; Since 'tis the Nothing of that all to me.

You know I have declar'd it. Ortell. But sure you'l not deny me twice. Amph. Not if you aske but once. Ortell. Fie, Fie, this Modesty is a Thiefe to Lovers And Robs them of their time, Come, Come Say I and blush. Amph. I'le not say I, nor blush. Ortell. If you had any Modesty you wou'd. Amph. You said just now I had too much. Ortell. To much of Impudence you mean. Amph. What's that you say. Ortell. Why truth. Amph. Get you out and wash your Tongue, tis foul. Ortell. 'Tis like your heart then, but that it Cannot Lye asmuch. Amph. Most valiant Lord to give the Lye to Petty-coates. Ortell. Why did you deny your being in the Prison. Amph. Not for fear of you, I was with the brave Prisoner, what then. Ortell. You went to make love to him, you had Best use your Time well, 'twill be short And sweet, your dear will not be so Proper a man by the head within this Two dayes. False woman, you have a Heart that flyes from one mans breast To another; all the inconstancy of your Sex is Constancy to this of yours: you Have deceiv'd the Duke already, that Might have been my warning. Amph. Faith and so it might, the Duke in all Things so Farr Excells you that you were A fool to think when once my heart Bid him farwell, that it design'd no Better a Change then you; troth you'r Mistaken, it had a further Journy to Make; and so took your Breast for an Inn, only to Lye by the way.

She may designe your Life, a woman that Is ill, Exceeds a man in mischiefe. Duke. My Lord I thank your Care, if you can Track her further, pray let me know, in The mean time I shall prevent her Ill intentions. Ortell. My dilligence shall not be wanting, so Since I can have no Love, Revenge Shall be my Mistris.â [Exit. Duke. Oh Amphelia why dost thou take such Paines to break my heart when 'tis to Easily done. She needs not secretly contrive My death since half a word from her, Commands my life, her face and heart, Sure cannot be a kin, Nature Mistooke, Or else she was too blame to give one Woman to so great Extreames. Enter Arbatus. See here comes the Brother to wrong'd Artabella. The horror of that sin growes bigger in me, That I with a deludeing Love shou'd foole An Innocent, to shew an outward scorn To false Amphelia, for when I heard she Lov'd Ortellus, I straight made Love to This young woman, and brought her from Her own Countrey, only to make Amphelia Think I lov'd another. Arbat. I hope I don't disturb your Highness Duke. No Arbatus you are alwaies welcome to me. Arba. Sir, I should ask you a question. Duke. You freely may. Arba. Not but I think my Sister far unworthy Either in Birth or Fortune, to be call'd Your Wife: Yet since you have been Pleas'd to grace her with your Love so Far, as saying she shall be your Dutchess, be pleas'd to tell me why It is not so; she has been here so Long, that people now begin to say you Mean her for your Mistress, shou'd my Eares meet that sound from any Tongue, I'deâ Duke.

These if you lov'd her for, you wou'd Not waste, by letting time rob her and You at once. Duke. Sir, business of great importance has Hitherto defer'd my Marriage, beleive Me you shall find me just. Arba. A Princes word must not be question'd I have done. Duke. Oh Amphelia what dos thou make me do. Exit. Arba. Let him take heed, if he dos fool my Sister, were He ten thousand Dukes I'de cut his throat. Exit. Enter Philidor alone. Philli. I have been quite at tother end ot'h Town to put my children out to new Nurses, for I am known so to every Nurse Here about, that they will as soon nurse A Cats kitten as any child of mine; this Is a very pleasant life I lead, neither Is this the worst part of it, for there are A certain flock of women that I have Promis'd Marriage, I expect a volly of Shot from them too, soon as they find Me out; wou'd Wives and Children were as hard to come by as Money, then wou'd I turn Usurer, and let 'um out to use, for To say truth I have enough to spare Enter Six Ladies one after another.

No Sir, 'tis that he may have a Thousand Deaths, instead of One, or one that has More pain then Thousands. Duke. What makes you thus incenc'd against him? Amar. Heaven knows I have too much cause, Sir I have Lov'd him long, and the day he was Your Prisoner, shou'd have been our Wedding, news being brought to me In my own Country, that he was to Dye, In flying hast I took this tedious journey With Sorrow; and with Joy, I here arriv'd; Tears in my eyes for his approaching Death, Smiles in my Cheeks to think Of dyeing with him, but when I came Unto the Prison gate, I met the Jaylor and He told me all, then let me in, and to rejoyce My Eyes, I saw two Devils lye in Chains together, and not half so fast As Chain'd in Love, all my intended Kisses then, I chang'd into as many curses On his heart, which with my eyes I Spoke as well as tongue, Duke. Alas poor injur'd Maid, we must be one another's Petiters, thy fate is mine; That woman which you saw with him, Has prov'd as false to me, as he to you: Amar. For Heavens sake Sir, let'um Dye both, No sight wou'd please us like their Blood, the Jaylor told me they lye as Close together all day, as if they were not two. Duke. Oh curse on'um! Amar.

Duke. Dear Amphelia, 'tis I that Loves thee, Tells thee so. Amp. Hark, now there's a god that saies he loves Me too, blest god, I'me sorry if you do, Since I have heard the Duke dos Love me still, He must be your rivall, indeed I cannot Help it, Oh let me fly down to the Earth Again, only to hear him say he loves me, I cannot promise when I shall return, That very word from him wou'd keep me there. Duke. I must answer her no more, they say 'Twill keep 'um longer in a Trance [he Ruls her. Ortell. I am but in a scurvy condition now, if She comes to life again, for they will Examine one another how the mistake Came between them, and then I am Sure it must come to light. Amph.

Can you forgive me Sir.â [Kneels. Zo. I cannot answer yet, Thy civility has took away my speech. Duke. Dear Amphelia, how came this sad Mistake 'twixt you and I. Amph. I'le tell you Sir in part, when you were In this last War, my woman receiv'd A Letter from one of the Gentlemen of your Chamber, wherein he did assure Her, that you had a new Mistriss in That Country, and therefore bid her tell Me of it, that I might by degrees, Wean my affection from so false a man As you. Duke. Here has been some foule play, for This very man you spoke of, receiv'd A Letter from your woman, wherein she Bid him assure me, that you were Prov'd false in my absence, and Lov'd my Cozen Ortellus. Guard. Go fetch them both hither Immediately, they shall dye without Mercy. Ortell. Nay then I had as good discover, 'Twill fall the heavier on me else. Sir let the Guard stay, And I will tell you all. 'Tis I, have sow'd the seeds of this mistake, I long have lov'd Amphelia, for which cause I tried this way to draw her heart from you. I knew this Gentleman of your Bed-chamber Was in Love with Amphelia's woman, Therefore I brib'd her to write to him, To assure the Duke that Amphelia lov'd me, And that she shou'd also charge him, to Write another Letter to her, wherein he Shou'd complain of the Dukes falling in Love with another woman in that Country, I knew your spirits both to be So great, that neither of you wou'd Stoop to one another, when you were Both possest of eithers falseness, and So it prov'd, for when the Duke heard You Lov'd me, he brought a fair New Mistriss over with him, to let you See hee did contemn you, and so Amphelia Sir, when she heard you Lov'd another, assured me then that she Lov'd me, which now I see was only To make you think how much she Scorn'd you; though still her heart Was true, and so was yours, now Sir I humbly beg your Pardon. Duke. 'Twill be in vain my Lord, I cannot Grant it; Oh Amphelia, how many Hours of joy, we two have lost. Amph. Base Lord. Enter Artabella. Artab. O Sir, I heard that people were to dye To day, let me be one I pray. Amph. Not for the World sweet innocence. Arta. Oh Madam you are she the Duke Loves, pray spare your Pitty, Sir can You have the heart to let me live, And see you Married to another? Amph. Have patience sweet young Maid, I will not Marry him, you wo'not blame Me if I love him though. Arta. No, for then I shou'd condemn my Fault in you. Duke. But sure Amphelia, you did but jest, In telling her you wou'd not Marry me; Amph. Indeed Sir I am in earnest; Consider 'Tis but justice, she loves you as well As I, her heart was quiet till you Troubl'd it. Duke. All this is true, but how will your Love shew, if you refuse to marry me? Amph. Not less at all, but make my Pitty more. Duke. If I wou'd marry her, I cant beleive That she wou'd be thus kind to you. Amph. Yes, I dare say she wou'd; ask her and try. Duke. Well Artabella, will you Marry me? Arta. You never hated me till now, can you Beleive I'de wrong so blest a Woman as Amphelia. Amph. See Sir, wou'd it be justice now in me, She will not wound my heart, shou'd I kill hers. Duke. But consider 'tis you I Love, not her, Amph. That's her misfortune Sir, yet she Deserves as much as I: I can but love You, so do's she. Duke. Dear Amphelia marry me? Amph. I cannot out of pitty Sir; Duke. Talke not of pitty, if thou wilt shew Me none. Amp. My pitty, is her due: my love is yours. Duke. O Amphelia, this was a cruell way to Make me happy. Thou'dst better still Have kept my joyes unknown; Then let the knowing of it be my death. Once more my dear Amphelia marry me: Amph. Do not Petition, her you may command In any thing but this. Duke. Monster of Villaines, thou hast caus'd All this; Excecutioner, immediately strike Off his head. Ortell. I'me sure you will not let me dye; Duke. Impudent Villain, dispatch him straight? Ortell. Hold Sir, 'tis only I can make you three Happy, which if you do not confess, When you have heard me speake, Then let me dye. Duke. Well let's hear it. Ortell. Promise me my life first, if I do. Duke. Well you shall have it. Ortell. Then know the Lady Artabella is Your Sister. Duke. Ha. Ortell. I say your Sister, you do remember That you had one once? Duke. Yes I do, but she was lost at three Years old. Ortell. 'Tis true 'twas thought so; but thus It is, when 'twas reported you were Slain in the Battail; I straight convey'd away this Lady Then a Child, because she shou'd not Stand 'twixt me and the Dukedome, I being Then acquainted with the Mother to Arbatus, I brought this Lady, and gave Her a summ of Money, to adopt her for Her Childe, with willingness my offer She imbrac'd, the more, because her Son Arbatus had then been lost About seaven years; thought to have Been cast a way at Sea; though after wards Return'd home, I had enjoyn'd her Secresy which she kept, therefore She told Arbatus 'twas his Sister. Enter Arbatus. Duke. And is she then my Sister. Oh, Arbatus, welcome, welcome; I have a crowd of Joyes, about my heart To tell thee. Arba. What! that you have broke my Sisters heart. Duke. Thou hast no Sister; 'Tis I possess that Blessing, Artabella, is my Sister, how Blest a sound is sister to my Eares, I'le give command, no other word but Sister shall be spoke throughout My Dukedome; I'le have it taught to Infants; so that when nature lends Their sucking tongues a meanes to Speak one word, they all shall Babble Sister, instead of Nurse, I'le Have the name ingrav'd in Gold on Every Post and Pillar in the Streetes, And passers by, shall worship it. Arba. I am amaz'd. Enter Philidor and Mirida. Duke. Welcome Philidor. Phili. I am glad to see joy in your lookes Again Sir, the time is long since I have seen you smile. Duke. Philidor, all that is Joy, I have within This Breast, it o're flowes and runs Into my Eyes; This is my Sister, oh What a word is Sister. And this my Dear and true, Amphelia. Come Mirida shall be thine, to day too. Mir. Hold Sir, I forbid that banes? Phi. Troth so do I too; you alwaies Take the words out of my mouth. You and I Marry kether. Mir. No faith, wee'l be hang'd first, I'de Rather hear along Sermon, then Hear a Person ask me, Mirida, Will you have this man for your Wedded Husband; to have and to hold. From this day forward and so forth. Phi. Right, for better, for worse, in Sickness, or in Health. Mir. I and perhaps after we have been Married half a year with ones Husband, falls into a deep Consumption, And will not do one the favour to Dye neither, then we must be Ever feeding him with Caudle. Oh from a husband in a Consumption, Deliver me. Phi. And think how weary I shou'd be Of thee, Mirida, when once we were Chain'd together, the very name of Wife, wou'd be a vomit to me, then Nothing, but where's my wife, call My wife to Dinner, call my wife to Supper, And then at night, come wife will you Go to Bed. Mir. I and that wou'd be so troublesome To be call'd by ones husband every night To go to Bed, Oh that dull, dull Name of Husband. Duke. Indeed you two are well met, The World has not two more such, I am confident. Mir. The more the pitty Sir. Phili. No Sir, if you please, never propose Marrying to us, till both of us have Committed such faults as are death By the Law, then instead of Hanging us, Marry us. Miri. And then you shall hear how Earnestly we shall Petition your Highness to be hang'd rather then Marryed. Duke. No man can judge which is the Wildest of these two. Now brave Arbatus, in all my Dukedome, There is but one gift worthy thy Receiving, and that's my Sister, Here Sir take her as freely as Heaven Gave her me. Arba. D'yee forgive me Sir, Duke. Or not my self Arbatus. This day, Hymen shall light his Torch for all. Phi. With your Pardon Sir, not for me And my Female. Mir. No faith, I'le blow it out if he dos. Arta. Sir, thought in my own desires, Shou'd have chose the man that You have given me, yet I beg We may not Marry yet, we have Call'd Brother and Sister so long, That yet needs must think we Are so still. Arba: Pray Madam, let's think so as Little a while as we can, that fancy May not keep my joy in Prison. Duke. Let's to the Temple now, and there thank Heaven for these unexpected Joyes. Each day the gods shall lend me in this life; I'le thank them for a Sister, and a Wife. [Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
