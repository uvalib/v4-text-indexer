      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST RENOWNED AND HAPPY MOTHER OF ALL LEARNING AND INGENUITIE, THE (LATE MOST FLOURISHING) UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD; THESE POEMS, AS MOST DUE, ARE HUMBLY DEDICATED BY HER MOST DEVOTED HONOURER AND ADMIRER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Thus thy left hand the Mighty Stagyrite Supports] Thus thy left hand the Mighty Stagyrite Supports, that thou might'st shield him wt h thy right: Whose early Soul aym'd high, yet allwaies hit; The sharpest, cleanest, full, square, leading Wit; The best Tyme's Best; could'st farthest, soonest pierce, Of all that Walk in Prose, or dance in Verse: Tis CARTWRIGHT, in his shadow's Shadow drest; He never is transcrib'd that once Writes best.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Memory of the most Ingenious and Vertuous Gentleman Mr Wil: Cartvvright, my much valued Friend. Stay, Prince of Phansie, stay, we are not fit To welcome or Admire thy Raptures yet; Such horrid Ignorance benights our Times, That Wit and Honour are become our Crimes: But when those happy Pow'rs that guard thy Dust, To us and to thy Memory shall be just, And by a Flame from thy bless'd Genius lent, Shall rescue us from this dull Imprisonment, Unsequester our Phansies, and create A Worth that may upon thy Glories wait; Then we shall understand thee, and descry The Splendour of Restored Poetry. Till then, let no bold Hand prophane thy Shrine, 'Tis High Wit-Treason to debase thy Coyn. K. P.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon Mr Cartvvright's Excellent Poems Now collected and published. If thou wouldst read what the best Poets writ, Strong sense, and Learning too, as well as Wit; Brave noble Passions, character'd aright, Cloath'd in such Language as each word bears weight; Then read these Poems, where thou mayst behold Later Times Product, and what was of old. For by consent of all, Cartvvright was he Who when the Court and University Did with most lustre flourish, took all Eyes, Wrote Wit for Youth, and Learning for the Wise. His Mirth is pure and Innocent, as free From lighter follies, as from Ribauldry: No far-fetch'd Trifles, nor no wrested words, Which rack the Writer first, and then affords Small pleasure to the Reader; all that's here Is easie, naturall, proper, and cleer: No strutting Sentences, walking on stilts, Nor Bumbast, which fits only Basket hilts; Nothing but what is Learning's Standard proof, Not a grain lighter then what doth behove. Then these, thus qualified, may well suffice, For Wit may quickly fall, but hardly rise: Especially in these our drooping Dayes, When Bullets are in more request than Bayes; Yet Cartvvright makes amends by his cleer Wit For all the Schismes the other Cartwright writ: His Poems pow'r may best by this be known, They turn me Poet, who before was none: So (taken in a good sense) men may call His taking Verses, Epidemicall. MONMOUTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr Cartvvright's Poems. They that make choice of Prose, and think what's writ In Verse is cheap, and easie kind of Wit, May blush and mend: here's higher Sense and Words Than all their low-born History affords: Such as at once may please and teach the Reader, Pindar and Aristotle bound together: A Wit that scorn'd to fill up Sense with Rime, Or to translate old Ends to modern Time; Cartvvright ne'r skulk'd in a worn Common-place, But in plain Field at sharp Wit shew'd his face; Nor on one line did a whole Twelve-month stand, Like the French Saint, his head was in his Hand, Ready, and clear, what He would write he knew, And made his Readers understand it too: He never tumbled out wild raunting things, As they who would seem lofty (without wings) Fine Pipkin-Giants, who can stalk about Sometimes with Sense, and oftener without; Who when they come to years, blush and give o'r, Condemning all themselves had writ before; No, his learn'd Phansie still was full of Light, First study'd how, and then began to write; Not a false Line, nothing without the Rule, Nor the grave Dull-man, nor the giddy Fool, But full and proper, all as best befits; The worst of daies enjoyes the best of Witts. T. P. Baronet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Incomparable Poems of Mr William Cartvvright, late Student of Christ-Church in Oxford. Not to deplore our Loss, nor to admire Thy Wit, I press into the numerous Quire Of thy Learn'd Friends, nor boldly to invite The Reader's Eyes, then raise his Appetite By promising Ambrosia for a Feast, The Muses Waiters, and the Godds the Guests: No, this let others speak, I'll only tell The World when Wit and pleasing Fancy fell; They dyed with thee, in thy decease they have Their Funerall, are buried in thy Grave; That who hereafter shall presume to wound Thy Ashes and my Truth, and his profound Non-sense shall with the Nobler Names belye Of Wit, High Fancie, Rich Conceits, may lye Dead, unregarded on the common Stall, The Title, and that only, read by all; Whilst the wise Readers, by me warned, do Spare both their Time, Money, and Anger too. For where hereafter shall the Muses trend Their eeven Measures? They alas are fled From their old Seats, their frighted heads to hide By Helicon's now long neglected side: There were such times, Great Oxford was the Stage Both of a Golden and an Iron Age: But ev'n those Conquerours, which durst defie Thy Prince's Pow'rs, do grant thee Victory; And humbly on thy Crowned Temples set The only Laurell which thy side did get. Let vanquish'd Nature once but apprehend A sudden and inevitable end, She summons all the Spirits from each part, Poast's fresh Supplies unto the fainting Heart, And now, near spent, some Action will produce Beyond the vigour of our warmest Youths, Then straight she droops and yields, as if that all Nature's design were but a glorious Fall: So when Rome's Potent Genius had decreed Cæsar should triumph, and the Senate bleed, It calls young Pompey forth, gives him an hour To try the Sum and utmost of his power; Omnium postrema certaminum Munda: ibi non pro cetera felicitate, sed diu triste prælium, inusitatam Cæsaris oculis, nefas, de extremis secum agitasse fertur Florus. lib 4. cap. 2.Wherein even Cæsar fears the doubtful Strife, Fighting not now for Victory, but Life; How near the top of Fate the Senate were That moment that precedes their Fall! for there Fell the great Faction's Soul, and rose no more, Or rose not now to emulate, but adore. So when our Peace-born Poetry perceiv'd The utmost thread of her short line was weav'd, More mindfull of her Fame than Life, in hast She snatch'd the Raies, and richest Beauties, grac'd Each severall Muse, Wit, Art, and Judgement mixt She on her new conceived Embrion fixt, Then did her pregnant Womb this Book disclose, The happy issue of her dying throwes; For then her Spirits fail'd; she only cry'd, I'l have no other Epitaph, and dyed: And dyed with an Effort, that did befit Th' expiring Genius of the English Wit. Edvv: Dering Baronet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr Cartvvright's excellent Poems, now Collected and Published. As in a Storm, when Waves with Waves do fight To sink some lofty Vessel's noble freight, The Sea-men sweat and run Lest all should be undone, And some wish, pray, and vow, Who nothing else can do: So now, Wit sinking, all Islands should unite, Both those that can, and those that cannot write. Yet all that all can do to honour this, Is but to tell the World whose Wit it is; For the try'd Author's Name Hath past the Test of Fame; So known a Classick Wit, That none will question it But bold Pretenders to the Poets Chair, Not Judges, but Condemn'd for sitting there. And hadst not Thou (Learn'd Cartwright) writ so high, Thy Mourners had been more than Standers-by; But now we cannot give, Nor thy full Fame receive, Nothing can make Thee less, Fall lower, or encrease, For thy Whole Name is perfectly thine own, Both Superstructure and Foundation. What a rich Soul was thine! so soon knew'st how To fill the Stage, the Schooles, and Pulpit too; Thy universall Wit All Things and Men could fit, So shap'd for every one As born for that alone: Not as where Growth, Sense, Reason, one controuls; But as if thou hadst had three Rationall Souls. Thou wrot'st so brave a Verse, that none know which Is best, the Art or Wit, 'tis all so rich; Thy Fansies are all new, Thy Language choice, and true; The whole Contexture wrought So much above our Thought As robbs Thee of thy own; thy Worth is such We cannot praise 'cause thou deserv'st too much. Then pay thy self (great Soul of Wit) for we If we restore, must steal it first from Thee: Be thy own Bayes, and stand With or without our Hand; For thy great Name shall live While men can take or give: Outstand all Columns, in th' old World, or New, Seth's Brick, and all those stones Deucalion threw. Io: Pettus Knight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr Cartvvright and his Poems. Some say that Poets, like Grand Signeurs, hate Their Brothers, yet will bury them in State. A bold expression of a strain so high, No Poet e'r invented such a Lye. Truth knows, when Cartwright liv'd and was inspir'd, I envied not what other Men admir'd: Nor (though on Tombs, Custome and Grief allow Hyperboles in Marble) will I now Follow him with a Complement so far, To plant his Spirit in a New-found Star. Yet I presume, a more harmonious Sphere Moves not in Heav'n, than Cartwright mov'd in here. Witness these Charmes and Raptures, which he sung Like th' aged Swan; but He, alas, dy'd young. So did Præfect [illeg.] Rome, the[illeg.] Sanctuary [illeg.] Treasuary [illeg.] the Law ([illeg.] Historian [illeg.] call him.) Papinian, whom the Romans saw The Miracle, and At the [illeg.] of 36. was [illeg.] put to [illeg.] by [illeg.] for deny [illeg.] to excuse [illeg.] murder [illeg.] his [illeg.] Get[illeg.]. Martyr of their Law; And still 'mong those the Learn'd Civilians quote, That grave young Chair-man hath a double Vote. Much more is due unto this younger Sage, A Man That merits th' honours of an Age. All Poets graces may in him be read, Why should not all their Bayes then crown his head? 'Tis true, he's of our Authors last set forth, But last in Order is the first in Worth: If Time be measur'd by an hour glass run, He may be Johnson's Grand-Child, Fletchers Son. If by desert, a Muse might be his Mother, He Homer's Heir, and Hesiod's elder Brother. Nature allow'd, when she did Cartwright mould, Not one and Thirty years to make him old, By living to time-past: There's in his List Of Friends Pythagoras and Trismegist; These Ancients will engage our Modern men, To doat upon their Learning in his Pen. Nor as his Knowledge grew did's Form decay, He still was strong and fresh, his Brain was gray. Such agedness might our young Ladies move To somewhat more than a Platonick Love, Which to prevent Fate barrs him their Commerce, And leaves them what is handsomer, his Verse: 'Tis an Adonis, they may safely wooe, Yet to our Sex 'twill be a Venus too, And make (in Poetry such vertue lurks) His Readers as immortall as his Works. Robert Stapylton Kt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr William Cartvvright's excellent Poems, collected and published since his Death. As that stout Bird proclames the early Day, While some sad Persians (afraid Their Shining God is dead, or lost his way) Darken the Night with their own Shade; But when they see Him rise, and spread, and stir, Their Clouds as well as His are gone, And without thanks to any Harbinger, They leap into Devotion: So (Cartvvright) while we speak thy blest Return, Apparell'd in thy Native Light, Those sadder Souls that wait upon thy Urn (Lamenting Wit's eternall Night) Beleeve it not, till thy own Beams break forth, And then transported (who can choose?) With the just admiration of thy Worth, Forget the Man that brought the news. Therefore, if Custome had not conquer'd Sense, Thy Glories should shine forth alone, For thy Attendants do but borrow hence, Thy Lustre being all thine own. Yet, as when Captives who were spar'd unslain, In numerous Swarms and Heaps are shown, Increase the Conquerours new spreading Train, And speak His Worth though they have none: So live; let the unblasted Laurell-Crown On thy bright Temples ever sit, For till thy lofty Soul be voted down, There's no Mortality of Wit. Io. Ieffryes Esq;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the deceased Author of these Poems. As when the Sun doth in full luster rise, The lesser Stars straight vanish from tho Skies, And shrink their wandring Heads into a Night, Made and drawn o'r them by a greater Light: So when thy Book, Ingenuous Soul, is read, Like a bright flame recover'd from the dead, All the small Poets of our Twilight Times Call in their borrowed Fires, and break in Rimes. Poor souls, Thou hast undone them; They are fain To their torn Black now to return again. Their Verse no longer will their Reckonings pay, Thin as their stuff Cloaks, and more lean than they, Who in a meaguer sadness walk the streets, As when a hard frost with sharp Hunger meets. Nor do I wonder; For what e'r of old Of great Wits born, or made so, hath been told, Without much flatt'ry to thy Ashes we Rare Cartvvright, may call Prophecies of Thee: Whose Native Fancie, quick, fleet, winged, free, Was such as Poets Fancies ought to be. Like early Students, toyling in the dark, Thou did'st not from a cold Flint call the spark Which was to light thy Candle; Nor did'st beat Thy frozen Brain into Poetick Heat Nor did thy Glass inspire Thee, nor the Wine Go half Wit with Thee in thy drunken Line: The Children of thy swift Soul from Thee came, Like Theirs who were deliver'd of a Flame, Kindled from their own Bowels; Wit in thee, Was such as vndri'd Fountains use to be; Which when they have whole years, and Ages run, Hold still as much as when they first begun: So Candles which light Candles at the Dore, Keep all the Treasure which they lent before. And as thy Wit was like a Spring, so all The soft streams of it we may Chrystall call: No cloud of Fancie, no mysterious stroke, No Verse like those which antient Sybils spoke; No Oracle of Language, to amaze The Reader with a dark or Midnight phrase, Stands in thy Writings, which are all pure Day, A cleer, bright Sunshine, and the mist away. That which Thou wrot'st was sense, and that sense good, Things not first written, and then understood: Or if sometimes thy Fancy soar'd so high As to seem lost to the unlearned Eye, 'Twas but like generous Falcons, when high flown, Which mount to make the Quarrey mere their own. For thou to Nature had'st joyn'd Art, and skill In Thee Ben Johnson still held Shakespear's Quill: A Quill, rul'd by sharp Judgement, and such Laws, As a well studied Mind, and Reason draws. Thy Lamp was cherish'd with supplies of Oyle, Fetch'd from the Romane and the Græcian soyle. The Muses were but half thy Nurses, who Didst to their Well joyn Aristotle's too; Travell'dst through all his secrets, and didst run A Course in Knowledge dayly like the Sun, And Nightly too; For when all other Eyes Were lock'd, and shut, but those that watch the Skies, Thou, like Discoverers at Sea, went'st on, To find out new Worlds, to all else unknown. Nor would thy busie Candle let Thee sleep, Till Thou hadst fathom'd the unfathom'd Deep. Hence, like Quick-silver kept from wandring, We Saw thy swift Wit fixt by Philosophy; And in that sight saw what we still admire, Remaining Circles writ in bounded fire. And as rich Jewels taken as they grow From the rude Rock, do unfil'd Treasures show, But by the Artist's Hand polish'd, and put Into fair figures, and in Angles cut, Do with their darted Lightnings strike from far The Eye, like some new many-corner'd Star: So thy Wit, Cartvvright, with wise Studies met, Shew'd like a Jewell in a bright Ring set; Or like rich Medals, which besides the Grace, Of being gold, take value from the face. Hence twin perfections in thy Writings knit, Present us with strange Contraries of Wit: Strength mix'd with Sweetness Vigorous, with Fair; Lucan's bold Heights match'd to staid Virgil's care, Martial's quick salt, joind to Musæus Tongue, Soft thorns of Fancie which from Roses sprung. Thou hadst, indeed, a sharp but harmeless Wit; Made to delight, and please, not wound, or hit: A Wit which was all Edge, yet none did feel Rasours in thy quick Line, in thy Verse steel; Or if they did, only from thence did spring A pointed Musick, sharpness without sting. Nor was thy Wit confin'd, or made to sail By one Wind, like theirs, who write by Retail: Thine was no Gold or Silver-End Muse, we All sorts of Poets did behold in Thee. Dramatick, Lyrick, and Heroick; Thou Knew'st when to varie Shapes, and where, and how. Witness thy Royall Captive, where we do Read thee a Poet, but sad Prophet too: A Play where Vertue so well languag'd shines, That Slaves are there made Princes by thy Lines. Witness thy other Poems too, and Songs, Such as turn'd Deserts heretofore to Throngs; And tun'd to th' Musick of a Thracian string, Made wild men tame, and Peace from Discord spring. But these thy looser Raptures must submit To thy rare Sermons, and much holier Wit; In whose rich Web such Eloquence is seen, As if the Romane Orator had been Sent forth to preach the Gospell; And had stood In our Assemblies powring out his floud. Thou wert a Poet, but thy Sermons do Shew thee to be the best of Preachers too; Who to thy Rhet'rick did'st such skill impart, As if Thou Heyr to some Apostle wert; Who taking Wing for Heaven, behind him left His fiery Tongue to Thee, and that Tongue cleft Into as many waies to save, as They Who are worst Sinners use to erre and stray. What holy Craft did in thy Pulpit move? How was the Serpent mingled with the Dove? How have I seen Thee cast thy Net, and then With holy Cosenage catch'd the Souls of Men? Preach'd Sin out of their Bosoms, made them see Both what they were, and what they ought to be? Made them confess the strait way by Thee strow'd With Flowers, was far more pleasant than the broad? Indeed, we Scripture-Wonders oft did spie, Camels by Thee drawn through a Needle's Eye. Thou wert not like our New-light men, who still Their frantick Censers with wild Incense fill: And holding forth their Shopboard Revelations, Turn into Bedlam's frighted Congregation. Nor like our Prester Johns, whom people hear Twice every Lords day, yet but once a year: Whose Sermons, like the Sands of the dry Glass By which they teach, turn'd, for new Sermons pass. Or as some thrifty Brother, neer half broke, Makes him new Breeches of his aged Cloke No, Thou wert one upon whose lips did dwell A Coal, like that, which from Gods Altar fell. No twice repeated Non-sense from Thee came: No Acorn trash, and that Trash still the same. Thou to all Hearers wert all Things, didst fly Low to the People, to us Scholars high; Hadst Milk for Children, and strong Meat for those, Whose Minds, like thine, to Mens perfections rose. Much more I should say of Thee, if that Heat Which wrought in thine, did in my Fancy beat. But as a Beautious Face, or sparkling Eye, Doubles its Grace if one deform'd stand by; So my rude Verse bound up with thine, may add Some Commendation to Thee by being bad; And I perhaps, by some be thought to praise Thy Book by bringing my half wither'd Bayes. The Wildeness of the Place in which I dwell, The Desert of my unfrequented Cell, My want of quick Recruits made from the Citty, And Times which make it Treason to be witty, Times where Great Parts do walk abroad by stealth, And Great Wits live in Plato's Common-wealth, Have made me dull: my Friends with some remorse See me, who wrote ill alwaies, now write worse. The little fire which once I had is lost, I write, as all my Neighbours speak, in frost. Or if ought be well said here, I confess Thou hast inspir'd the matter and the Dress. As when Elias dropt his Mantle, He Who took it up began to Prophesie. Jasper Mayne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr Will: Cartvvright's excellent Poems, Now collected and Published. Is Wit condemn'd to dye, that now she sets Her House in Order, and her Goods in gets? That things which here and there did loosely lie She does call home, and up in Bundles tie, As if there were an Inventory mean't T'annex to her last Will and Testament? Or is She Dead? and of her Self bereft, We seek all Fragments of her which are left, And what we have, charily keep in store Because we have no hope of having more? So when Friends are Deceas'd, and Bodies Burn'd, Their Scatter'd Ashes are rak't up and Urn'd. Else why of late so many Poems? more These last Sev'n years, than in three Sev'ns before? Thus Suckling, Waller, the Dioscuri Beaumont and Fletcher, Twins of Poësy: Thus Thou, whose Clear Soul when it hence did move Did new white-ore the Milky-way above; Whose Lines, Clear as that Soul, oft blest a Hand When in one Single Paper they did stand, Bestow'st thy whole Self on us, and do'st give More than is fit we should at once receive. While thy Dis-joynted Limbs, knit one to one, Anticipate a Resurrection, And rise a Spirituall Body, full of Light And Divine Heat; Agility and Might. Or is't at last some pow'rfull Influence Of Stars, or, what does guide Stars, Providence, Sends Cartvvright now among us? when the Weeds Of Barbarism do eat out richer Seeds, This fatall Climacterick unto those That durst own ought 'bove Ignorance and Prose: To shame men into Sense, to teach them (what They now learn to forget) to speak, so flat Our sharp'st Expressions are, so rude even when We attempt Eloquence! We speak to Men, Nay speak to God, in Language will abide The Iron Bracelets and the Horn by th' side. This is Sad truth; And 'tis time to learn Wit, When Men come from the Dead to teach us it.

      <field name="fulltext">On the publication of the Posthume Poems of M. William Cartwright, sometime Student of Christ-Church in OXON. How subject to new Tumults is this Age! With War lesse vex'd now, than Poetick Rage! Were not State-Levellers enough! that yet We must be plagu'd with Levellers of Wit? Delvers in Poetry? that only skill To make Parnassus a St George's Hill? The Cyrrhan Grove's almost disforrested To furnish Wreaths for each bold Rimers Head; The Muses fear a Rape, or a Surprize, So Phæbus might, but He their Fury flies. What Pow'r may we invoke then, to withstand This growing Plague? behold! a courteous Hand, A kind, and timely Succour doth dispence: Cartvvright comes forth; blush Sons of Impudence, And Little Wit!

      <field name="fulltext">To my dear Mother the Vniversity of Oxford, Upon Mr Cartvvright's Poems. Alma Mater, Many do suck thy Breasts, but new in som Thy milk turns into froth and spumy scum; In Others it converts to rheum and steam, Or some poor wheyish stuff in stead of cream; In Som it doth malignant humors breed, And make the head turn round as that-side Tweed; These humors vapor up unto the brains, And so break forth to odd fanatic strains; It makes them dote and rave, fret, fume and foam, And strangely from their Texts in Pulpits roam, When they should speak of Rheims, they prate of Rome, Their theam is birch, their preachment is of broom: Nor 'mong the Forders only such are found, But they who pass the Bridg are quite as Round. Som of thy Sons prove Bastards, sordid, base, Who having suck'd Thee throw dirt in thy face, When they have squeez'd thy Nipples, and chast Papps, They dash thee on the Nose with frumps and rapps; They grumble at thy Commons, Buildings, Rents, And would bring Thee to farthing Decrements; Few by thy milk sound nutriment now gain For want of good concoction of the brain. But this choice Son of thine is no such brat, Thy Milk in him did so coagulat That it became Elixar, as we see In these mellifluous streams of Poesie. Iames Hovvell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Stationer (Mr Moseley) on his Printing Mr Cartvvright's Poems. I that have undergone the common Fate In making shift to lose my own Estate, Have felt that which did Thousands more befall, Thrice in a Siedge, and once in Goldsmiths-Hall; Return'd with much adoe to my own Clime, Am now just strong enough to make a Rime: Not to write Wit, which I pretend not to, But to admire those Noble Souls that do: Whose high Atchievments Thou hast brought to light, Setting forth Wits who best knew how to write: Thou rais'd brave Suckling, gav'st him all his own, Aglaura else had not been waited on: Then gav'st us melting Carevv, who so long Maintain'd the Court with many a charming Song: Then Waller's Muse for Saccharissa flows, Yet (for his Life) courts the High Court in Prose; Beaumont and Fletcher's Volume then stood forth, And taught the World what English Wits are Worth: Then came the Sophy deck'd by Denham's Quill With Flowers as fresh as those on Coopers Hill: Then fam'd Nevvcastle's choice Variety, With his brave Captain held up Poetry: Then Madagascar fill'd our British Isle With Love and Honour, wrought by Davenant's file: Brave Stapylton translates old Wit and new, Musæus, Juvenal and Strada too: Then Pastor Fido (cloath'd by Fanshavv's Pen) Confess'd 'twas never nobly dress'd till then: So did Aurora and Oronta too, Whom hopefull Stanley into English drew: And Sherburn made old Seneca tell why Knaves oft triumph while Good men smart and dye: Then flowry Heath made Clarastella known, Dressing her fine with good wit of his own: Then learned Crashavv's Muse proves to the eye Parnassus lower than Mount Calvary: And among all these shining costly Pearls Thou left'st not out Sherley, nor Benlowe's Quarls: All these thou gav'st us, rich and precious stuff, And one would think that here was Wit enough. But after all, thou bringst up in the Reare One that fills ev'ry Eye, and ev'ry Eare, Cartvvright, rare Cartvvright, to whom all must bow, That was best Preacher and best Poet too; Whose learned Phansie never was at rest, But always labouring, yet labour'd least: His Wit's Immortall, and shall honour have While there's or Slavish Lord or Royall Slave. And since thy hand is in, gather up all Those precious Lines which brave Wits have let fall; Gather up all that from Mayne's fansy fell, Whose able Muse hath done so oft so well: Give us all Cleveland, all his gallant lines, Whose Phansie still in strong Expressions shines: Give us all Berkenhead whose soul can more In half an hour than others in four score: Give us what Covvley's later years brought forth, His Mistresse shews he was a Wit by birth: Give us our Northern Vincent, and our Brovvn, Who are true Wits though not so publike known: Give us all these, and all omitted here, For times approach wherein Wit will be dear. So, as poor folkes delight to talk of wealth, I name good Wits, though I am none my self. Jo. Leigh, Esquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vpon the Ingenuous Author and his Poems. Lend me (Blest spirit) from thy new-born Wing The meanest Feather, and thy worth I'll sing: What though the Muses springs are almost dry, Each heart may find a Fountain in the Eye Wherein to dip its quill; and 'tis most fit To mourn, since Death hath over-master'd Wit. Yet maugre Fate, thy Pregnant Ingeny Revives thy Dust, and dreads no Victory: This Birth we owe to Death: so, the Old gone, A new sprung Phœnix to the World is shown. Thy Poems are the Lectures of our Age, Which teach Divinity to tread the Stage; And new apparell Vertue by thy Dress, That through thy Fansies she gains Comeliness: Perhaps our Times may love her now, she looks So like her selfe, through all thy learned Books; And undisguised Vice may thence descry How neer she is to her sad Destiny: Then died'st Thou well, thus to revenge our Sins; And, dead, like Sampson kill'st most Philistines.

      <field name="fulltext">On Mr Will: Cartwright's excellent Poems. Cartwright, Thou liv'st; They that suspect Thee dead, Know thee not yet; Thou liv'st to all that Read: Our sage Fore-fathers (when they had no Son) Begat a Pillar, glad to live in Stone: Thy Marble Book needs no such Masonry, Is its own Pillar, and Posterity: When others put off Flesh, They're dead and gone, But Thou canst change that Rayment, and Live on; Being return'd in a more happy Dress, Cloath'd with Ubiquity by this one Press. Thy Friends whom Five-mile Prisons do confine, And those that breath within the larger Line, Will joy to see thy glorious Shadow move, The Object of their Wonder and their Love. In thee, all Wit, Art, Learning, meet and flow, The Poets hand makes the best Oglio: All learn from Thee; Divines, Philosophers, And (if the Air could brook them) Courtiers: They that have lost fair Studies, buying Thee Will hardly miss their Plunder'd Library: All gain, except the Stationer, and He Will lose in Others what he gains by Thee, For though thy Tenth Impression won't suffice Those that will buy Thee up at any Price, Yet he defalkes a Thousand Things would sell (Before thy Book did blast them) passing well; Which now lye on his hands, condemn'd to live At a less Rate that any man will give. Thus Thou at once dost shame and Crown the Press, All Poets that succeed Thee shall go less. Fr. Finch, è Soc. Int. Templ.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON Mr William Cartvvright's excellent Poems. VVhy did'st Thou climb so fast, That in the Morning of thy Age High Noon was overpast? We had enjoy'd thee still, Greater, if less; thy noble Stage Thou did'st too soon fulfill. When the World's Sun doth ride Up to his Zenith, who can hope Those Glories should abide? Higher he cannot get, And having once attain'd his Scope, Like Thee he needs must set. But the Sun gone, the Night Has the same Emanation, Though by a Proxy light: So thy full Poems live, Thou dead; whose warm Reflexion Still the same heat does give. And since Thou art so bright, Our Praises Thou dost far outshine; Dazling our weaker sight: The Diamond only can Cut Diamond; that great Soul of thine Exceeds the thoughts of Man. Whats best cannot be prais'd; The single lustre of the Sun Cannot by Croud of Stars be rais'd; Nor can the Spring disclose Colours, or Sweets, but are undone In presence of the Rose. Who can adorn that Face Whose matchless Beauty once display'd, All Ornament doth grace? Write fair and mend, you blot; Imperfect Silver may crave aid Of Gilt; Gold needs it not. Thus whilst thy Giant worth Bedwarfes our Fansies; all our words Do Cloud, not set thee forth: Be then unto our Muse ('Tis all our Plunder'd VVorld affords) Both Object and Excuse. Io. Finch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vpon Mr. Cartvvright's Poems, published long after his death. Resigne, proud Dust! what Power entitles thee To this, which we account our Legacie? Possession cannot be a Plea; if so, We should our selves to thee for ever owe. From earth then (Cartwright,) not as Metals, rise, Which first refin'd and then impress'd we prize, But like an Orient Pearl which long time lay Within his Coffin shell expecting day, Break forth all Jewell, what from thee we file Is lost; so rich, so polish'd is thy stile. But why didst thou such matchless Fansies show Only that we the greater losse might know? Why didst thou (cruell Father to thine owne) Suppress thy Births till they were Orphans grown? Why did'st thou leave this darksome Universe Without the light of Poet or of Verse? For since like Phæbus thou withdrew'st thy light, Thou might'st have left some Star to guide the night: What have our Phansies been since thou wert gone? Nothing but Chaos, and Confusion; Thy scatter'd Poems in this Chaos made, Like to the new-born light, a gloomy shade; But now 'tis wrought into an Orb and Sun, This day is Poetry's Creation. Yet I have err'd, as all poor Mortals must, That think all thine thus long intomb'd in Dust; Thou with thy Sacred Hymns did'st climb the Spheres, As penn'd for Angels, not for Humane Ears; Where thy inspired Verse, divine like thee, Became a Present to the Deity; How often were they tun'd to Heavenly Lyre? How often sung in winged Angels Quire? From whence at length as minding us were hurl'd Thy holy Anthems to this lower World. Sure then the Press did well to stay: before There was in thee good Wit, good Verse in store; But we for this fram'd Body did require, As once Prometheus did, an holy fire; For Earthly (though pure) Matter cannot move Untill the Soul descendeth from above. Thomas Baines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Memory of his honoured Friend Mr VVilliam Cartvvright. VVere there a Soule so unconfin'd as Thine, That could it's own great self express In that inimitable Dress Wherewith thou didst adorn thy thoughts Divine; Yet ev'n that Soul unable were to tell How much of more than Man with Cartwright fell. The world despaires to know thee half, unless Thou leave those happy Soules above, (Of late made happier in thy Love) To teach that worth, which Thou couldst not express Till now by Death enlightned: For before, Thy Modesty hid much, thy Flesh hid more. As when a Fleet miscarries richly fraught, Merchants can only sigh in gross Their sad irreparable Loss, Unable to recount the Wealth it brought: So we can only tell we are undone; Unknown's the Wit, Arts, Language with thee gone: But if some happy Wave do force to Land A Box of Jewels from the Main, The Loss grows greater by this Gain, By this we the rich Lading understand: So we sum up our Loss by this thy Book At what we can scarce guesse at wonder-strook! We in rude accents thy great worth deplore, (When Thunder's gone, we heare a Noyse The Reliques of the former Voice, And then all's hush'd and quiet as before:) And this our last wit bring unto thy Herse, The weak and confus'd Eccho of thy Verse. What Glass, what Ocean is there here below, That can reflect a Lustre bright And Active, as the Native Light? Much less what Mortall Pencill can it show? He that would truly know thy worth, must fly To Heav'n; why sigh we here then? Let us dye; So shall we see Thee in full glory shine Amidst those nobler Spirits, where To Glories of a Lower Sphere Thou stream'st down Lustre, Knowledge, Love divine: And heark! me thinks th' enlightned Powers say, Dear Soul, thou art more Seraphin than They. Will: Creed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Memory of his deceased Friend. Mr William Cartvvright. Sad Thoughts delude me, or His Ghost groan'd thrice. Yee load his Marble with your Elegies: Like Pelias' Daughters, in a pious rage To' renew his Youth yee lose his better age. Your Zeal's prophane, your Superstition more, That rob, or scandall whom you most adore; (Who rifle Tombes, for Reliques shrine each Toy,) Whom Men admire, ne'r let him grow past Boy. Were't not to slay by Picture, to draw thus Amidst Child-sports, Scipio and Lælius (Their Tragick fields chang'd for their Comick Stage) Stroking with Numbers the affrighted Age? Mars and Fame's Trump, their Scenick pipe o're stran'd, Their name from Terence, more, than Africk, gain'd: But Their Great Acts made all admire their Less; Whose Sports, like Shadows, heighten'd the whole Dress. These Flames, to other Flames bequeath'd, his Fame How can they raise, rais'd only by his Name? Fate and his Praisers have like Spight betray'd, Making his highest Sun his shortest Shade: And should our Love, with greater Malice sin, To end his Glories where he did begin? This Work's the Author's Libell; but to those Who can Proportions from the Foot disclose; (The Foot, th' old standing Measure) thence draw Lines To limne an Hercules, or what defines The Course of Phæbus, Circles of the Arts, Vertues and Sciences joyn'd for his Parts. (As those grave Mapps, dumb Tutors, that descry Ethicks and Arts Embody'd to the Eye) Let each Hand sway both Globes, as in their Spheare; That as Divine, this as Philosopher: And, what beyond the utmost Spheare we guess, Space and Infinity, his Thoughts express. For Wit's the Chymick Mercury, that mix'd With pure Allaies, with th' Arts, not dull'd, but fix'd, (No Vinegar in Asses hoofs) serves then More than to cure the Itch, or flux the Pen; Work's all things unto all, unseen, and scapes From Earth to Heav'n through gross and aery Shapes. That Wit, that charm'd the Stage, convinc'd the School, Did, less in Verse than Samian Numbers, rule. Thence to the Pulpit rapt, to Paul's third Sphere, He rapt us too: 'twas Heaven but to heare. Phani'sies and Reason sainted, Visions grew, And all that heard, like Saul, did proph'sy too. All Passions lost, but what he then did shirr; And all Opinions, but what hee'd preferr. All this is worse than Slaunder: though a Praise, Greater than all he lent; but what he was To tell the World, without a Veyl t' express What he would be — for we may not be less Modest than Scepticks; who dare not reveal Nature's hid Beauties; nor speak Truths, that steal Like Rivers from their sight; nor tell the houres Which, e'r they're told, surpass that Line. What Powr's, What Astrolabe, Degrees and Heights can show Of spreading Beams, Flames that by Motion grow! How did He others more, Himself out-do! His later Fame did still his first renew; His thriving Parts, his Brains so kept unknit By Verse (the Youth, not Weakness of his Wit) That like to Numbers, Infinite, his Store Ne'r fill'd the Sum, only enlardg'd the Score. That Monster (Nature made and feared both, Letting it fall without bounds to its growth,) The Crocodile, which like Nile's streames, still growes Bigger as't runns, and with fresh vigour flowes, Did thus come forth, full grown in its first slime, And still retain'd that Youth in spight of Time. Younger with years, with Studies fresher grown, Still in the Bud, still blooming, yet full blown. Ambitious Souls, that climing to the height, Enlarge their Prospect, with their Appetite, Still towring up, till past the Point they rise; And end their flight in a steep precipice, Take not so endless flights, nor aime so high As He, now only top'd by' Eternity. O for a Pen, that could supply the Text Of Virgil's Muse! which leaves the Reader vext, Led on by eager heat to know the rest, And what's unknown admiring for the Best. Wonder and Grief be Muses! Blanks invent For Virgils and for Cartvvright's Supplement. But there's a Toleration now; the Hill Levell'd to' a Plain, all bellowing Cattle fill: What Spleen (that makes Fools witty) what Disease (That taught the Rowt to rave Euripides, Run mad in Verse, and in sick Raptures dye) Hath seiz'd this Age? must we thy Musick try, To cure, or tune their Noise? Thy Eagles Plume May impe Fames Wing, though all the rest consume. Thy hallow'd Birth w' invoke, to expiate (More than all ? Stars) the dismall Fate Those monstrous Broods long threaten'd from the Press, Which never labour'd more, nor brought forth less. As the Dutch Lady, who at once did bear Numbers, not Births, to date each day i'th' year, Grew barren by Encrease; and after all, None could Her, Mother, or them Children, call. So whilst All write. None judge, we multiply So many Poems, and no Poetry. Verse that for Charmes may pass; more Noise than Sense, As Northern Coyn, for Pounds cheat's us with Pence. Something that sounds like Wit, but must be lent More from the Reader, than the Author meant. Wild Phant'sies chain'd in Verse; whose thicker Skull Think judging Virgill, where he's Proper, Dull. Thy Quill, more nimble in the Hand, than Wing, With every Dash op'ning a fresher Spring, Shed Words as quick as Thoughts: nor seem'd t' endite, But to transcribe what lay before in sight: And with that ease we read, Thou didst dispense Wit to thy Numbers, and to Wit sure Sense. By Thee Posterity shall string her Lyre, Taught both to guide and to repair their Fire: And from thy Book Readers be Poets made, (As Silius wrote inspir'd by Maro's Shade) Which shall, as Giants Bones, amuse the Mind With doubt to see one grown above the Kind. Thine, and Our Verse, as Floud-marks, stand to show How high the Spring once ran, and now how low. Rob: Waring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Memory of Mr William Cartvvright. As the great World, built in a Week, shall lye Flat at one blow (for Death and Time shall dye:) So Oxford, twice-six Ages upward grown, Sunk all at once, and fell from Best to None. For (Cartwright) when thy Fall shrunk up the Gown, Fate scorn'd the Sythe of Time, to mow all down Slew manly Diggs, high Masters, all the chiefe, And damn'd all Remnant-Wits to suffer Life. Yet if thy lofty Soul could stoop from high, 'Twould sweat to build, as others to destroy. Thou couldst retrive and fashion us again In that great Shop of Miracles, thy Brain. Thy Sense and Reason (Man's two Eyes) would reach All that Lay Prose or Sacred Verse could teach. Armies of Words and Phansies, rais'd by Thee, Would rescue all the Arts vast Heptarchy. But Thou art gone: and groveling Trifles crawl About the World, which but confirm thy Fall. The Belgick Floud, which drank down fifty Townes, At dead-low water shews their humble Crowns: So, since thy flowing Brain ebb'd down to death, Small Under-witts do shoot up from beneath. They spread, and swarm, as fast as Preachers now, New, Monthly Poets (and their Pictures too) Who, like that Fellow in the Moon, look bright, Yet are but Spots because they dwell in Light. For thy Imperiall Muse at once defines Lawes to arraign and brand their weak strong lines. Unmask's the Goblin-Verse that fright's a page As when old time brought Devills on the Stage. Knew the right mark of things, saw how to choose, (For the great Wit's great work is to Refuse,) And smil'd to see what shouldering there is To follow Lucan where he trod amiss. Thine's the right Mettall, Thine's still big with Sense, And stands as square as a good Conscience. No Traverse lines, all written like a man: Their Heights are but the Chaff, their Depths the Bran: Gross, and not Great; which when it best does hit Is not the Strength but Corpulence of Wit: Stuft, swoln, ungirt: but Thine's compact and bound Close as the Atomes of a Diamond. Substance and Frame; Raptures not Phrensies grown; No Rebel-Wit, which beares its Master down; But checks the Phansy, tames that Giant's Rage As He that made huge Ascapart his Page. Such Law, such Conduct, such Oeconomy, No Demonstrator walks more steadily. Nothing of Chance, Thou handled'st Fortune then As roughly as she now does Vertuous men. Still saw'st thy Way; not a mote in thy Brain; There needs no spotted Margent make Thee plain. Great Sense, rich Words, full Numbers, kiss and greet; The Head's not clogg'd with Cold sent from the Feet. No grim-stiff-iron Verse, stuck full of Points; Thy Elephant doth but conceale his joynts. No line writ with a Gantlet, dragg'd along; The Purple Queen's silk Cables, smooth and strong. Thine swims away, clean as its Lord the Sun Doth 'twixt his Tropicks rather saile than run. Yet not meer Forme and Posture, built of Slime; 'Tis Substantive with or without its Rime. Meer Verse hath but the Pace of Wit, treads high, But, a proud Beggar, in straw-Prose should lye: For such, if worse, were better, 'twould shew skill; 'Tis somewhat hard to write extremely ill. Thine, the right Verse is Man, hath Voice, Feet, Sense, Passion, and Aire, Phansie, Intelligence: If it want Fire, and be not sweetly fierce, 'Tis but a coward Rime, no true-born Verse. Where are such Flames, such Puissance and Sway, As thy Cratander, or Lucasia! His Soul would fill a Globe; yet big as 'tis, Hers would informe as great a World as His. What vast sweet Horrours (Love and Wit) exprest! Such Living Metaphors, so costly drest, Thy Language is all Tissue; no one part But comes from All the Magazines of Art. For as immortall Harvey's searching Brain Found the Red Spirit's Circle in each Veyn, Hath open'd Straights, and saild our World about, As if He made that Sluice, not found it out: So Wit, the bloud of Verse, in every line Drawn by thy hand, doth shoot, and work, and mine, This Gulfe, that Isthmus, through each Science dart's, And proves its Circulation through all Arts. All-over Wit, ne'r runs a-ground, but rides In ever-flowing never-ebbing Tides. Not sometimes rampant, sometimes groveling down, But still keeps up its brave Complexion; Which, like a German Prince's Title, runs Both to thy eldest and to all thy Sons. For Thine's a Spring; Thy Phansie works and beats Swift as the Pulse, and strikes no second Heats. Not drawn with Engines; didst not pant, resist, Long as the all-consuming Alchemist. Nor for some mighty line were stretcht and torn Till 'twas thy Son because Nine Months e'r born. Thou didst but bid it flow, and then thy Stile Came easily as flatterd Ladies smile. And hadst writ Greek or Latin with like ease, But Sense and Reason speak all Languages. These were thine own, not plunderd; Thou hadst not Adopted Phansies, Thine were all begot. Thou knewst such gatherd Raggs would ill befit Thy Wardrobe, but their Frippery of Wit; Whose new Productions like new Rome do swell, Where, for one Native, thrice two strangers dwell. Thou wert thy self, lett'st all the Godds alone Which Hesiod rear'd, or Lucian laugh'd down. Thy Laurell grew on thee, that verdant Crown Will last, 'tis not usurp'd, 'tis all thine own. And now tis publish'd; they that pilfer'd Thine And beat a new broad page out of one line, (Who adding Brass or Pewter of their own, Of a Kings shilling made a false Half-crown) Must quit their Trade, their Night and Shades are gone, Hee's a bold Thief that robs 'twixt Sun and Sun. They'l blast thee now, as in this roguing Age Some writ dull Poems, then raild down the Stage: They try'd for Wit, but fail'd, then (lest men know it) With Antonine thank God they are no Poet. Looking at Verse as on some fatall thing, As if twere some good Bishop or great King. No, Thine's as free from Danger as from Gall, ('Twas the bold leaden Prose that routed all:) Thou hadst no Fangs, though thou wert quick and smart, Thy Wit was not thy Irascible part. No bloody drops did from thy Pencill fall, Thy blackest Scean's but Tragi-comicall. Nor were these drunken Fumes, Thou didst not write Warm'd by male Claret or by female White: Their Giant Sack could nothing heighten Thee, As far 'bove Tavern Flash as Ribauldry. Thou thought'st no ranke foul line was strongly writ, That's but the Scum or Sediment of Wit; Which sharking Braines do into Publike thrust, (And though They cannot blush, the Reader must;) Who when they see't abhor'd, for fear, not shame, Translate their Bastard to some Other's name. No rotten Phansies in thy Scenes appear; Nothing but what a Dying man might hear. All of all Sexes may pronounce or show it, Thou (as old Prophets) wert annointed Poet: Who didst (when thou had'st Sockt and Buskind gone) Without Remorse put th' holy Girdle on. Then, then what dreadfull Sweetnesse didst thou show, Making the Learn'd admire, and tremble too! Thunder was set in tunes; the Temple shak'd, Graves of each Bosome open'd, Dead sinns wak'd, Lightning, and Darknesse, Earthquakes, every thing As if the Jewes re-crucifi'd their King. Thou might'st affright our would-be Atheists pride, Who talk, drink, scribble, all for any side; Pretending Depths, that Others know but th' Brim, Soules that can dive because they ne're could swim. But Cartwright's gone: and now such Levites teach As that hard Heap to whom old Bede did preach: Clodds, that can only sink a Ship: whose skull Can be at once exactly mad and dull: Still scalding hot, and yet the Brain so dead, Pigeons apply'd draw nothing from Their head: Can roar an Age, ne'r out, 'cause never in; (For they can never end, did ne'r begin.) But, as His weekly thrice-nine Leagues had hurld Fourty-yeeres-Hobson eight times round the World, Yet weaving still the selfe same Lanes and Stiles, His Ninescore Thousand were not Fifty miles: So, though our Sermon-winder stretch his Tale Till the Church marble, nay till his Lungs fail, Yet, from his first Give eare to' his last Amen, 'Tis but the same sad puffing-work agen. But thou didst still reveale; still new, and choice; Wert the great Africk Prince weares no Cloaths twice. Such Power, that had those Gentiles heard thee then, They'd cry again the Gods come down to men. What vast Dominions thy rich Wit would have! All things that are, and are not, were thy Slave! Nothing withstood thy Phansy's Battery, But All confess'd ther's Nothing Poet-free. Me thinks Thou now art in thy Study set, Thy Curtain drawn, and all thy Notions met: How glorious high thy flaming Phansie beats, While yet thy ballanc'd Judgement still retreats, Summons, arraignes, confounds, saves, routs, turns, hurls Ten thousand waies ten hundred thousand Worlds! But oh! 'twas this, this rapt thee hence; we know Nothing could fill thy spacious thoughts below. Thou hadst too much Soul, Nature might assigne Another's Soul but to embody Thine. But Wit (the Beauty of the Minde) ne'r stay's, Tis lost as soon as a bad Girl's good face. Too oft (like Thee) live's but its thirtieth Yeer, And then (with Spanish wives) leaves off to bear: For when it climbs to fourty, tis so high, Down streight it fals to Beard and Husbandry. The Poet's head's on fire, that glowing flame Makes him not cinders, but it melts his Brain. No Salamanders wool, it burns too strong: Old Poets onely liv'd long since, not long. If any to a Cubit stretcht their Span, Twas not the Poet liv'd, 'twas but the Man. Bald Æschylus, wither'd Simonides, Might have been begg'd (as well as Sophocles:) Half of whose eighty yeers were blank, and thrown Eighty degrees into the frozen Zone: Degraded, as that proud Chaldæan was All the dumb yeers God turn'd him out to grass. Their Aged Wit's born wrinkled, th' After-birth Is cold and dry as Elementall earth. The Poet growes not green, 'tis but his Tree; His Name, his Verse shall never fade, not Hee. And so shall Thine, flourish, though thou art dead, Till every line be blazon'd, and not read: Shall stand thy Monument, when some that have Huge Tombs, are found unworthy of a Grave. Thy Orphan Book shall perish'd Wit restore: Thus, Thou liv'st after Death, We die before. For when a coward Victor, in cool blood Butcher's some Chieftaines who had nobly stood, Those that have Quarter or (perhaps) Reprieve, Do blush, and think it scandalous to live: So We, thy blasted Friends, with shame survive, Who have so often dy'd, 'cause yet alive. Our Sighs and fetter'd thoughts blow out our Braines, (As captiue Cælius dasht out his with's Chaines.) Thy Oxford's but a Town; since she lost Thee, England's Right Eye can only weep, not see. And her bright Sister failes, Both must preferre Those two proud Dames, London and Westminster. Behold poor Britaine in its first wild Looks When it had Swords and Druids, but no Books! Yet then th' unletter'd Bard could tune his Thought, For the rough Gaul swam hither to be taught: But now this savage Isle will soake in Blood Till 'tis but one red Bog; whose guilty mud Will sink, or make some Clowd of Brimstone fall; Or else old Corah's Earthquake sweep down all. Something, bad Angels hope, the good one feares: Beasts are but nine daies blind, but Men ten Yeares. John Berkenhead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr William Cartvvright's surviving Poems. Phæbus, 'tis time, lay by thine own Leaves now, [Statius: Shade thy gilt Locks with a sad Cypress Bough: Thy prais'd mourn'd Heir is dead; no Muse, not one Can call him back to Life, unless his own. He who could teach the Sisters how to sing, And thee, Apollo, thy soft Lyre to string, He whose harmonious Soule (since some there be, For want of Ayre, deny Spheres Melody) Hath bid those very Spheres, though they lack sound, Unto his Pipe to dance their silent Round; Our and Thy Wonder, He whose name alone Heightned Parnassus, 'tis He, Cartvvright's gone. Yet when thou seest (after his own breast's Doom) His Phœnix-Verse spring from his spicy Tomb, And think'st that the whole Species is not worn Quite out, because himself is thus re-born; Yet, yet forbear thy Lawrell; Wrap thy Head Still in the Cypress Arbour, for He's dead: Slip down to Saturne; what Jove's power did do His Worth will act here, and depose thee too. And though we now, after his Death, dare write, Prometheus-like we steal from Heav'n our Light, That is, from Him; When Thy self sett'st (and He By very loss of Time's more God than thee) The petty Stars appear, and shine, yet all Their Lustre is bequeath'd but from thy fall; If any Verse (his hand congeal'd) may pass, 'Tis but his own seen fainter in a Glass; A dead and cold, like and more unlike, shade; Such as by Thee at Thetis call was made. And thou, great Prince of Numbers, (like some Lord Fear'd for his Power, and for his Parts ador'd) Wert too great for Applause, a full Delight To th' taken Eare, but Envy to the Sight! How did the factious London-Wits first praise, And then with slanderous But maligne thy Bayes! How they arraign'd thy skill in Comædy, And before Plutarch su'd thy Play and Thee! Sir, may This pass upon the Stage? may That? May Ghosts speak, Sir, or else I pray' say what? (So hardly could they speak, as if Ghosts grown Themselves, and turn'd into the Question:) Nay but, good Sir, Plutarch himselfe saies Nay, In what Tongue? In our Mother Tongue, we say: Do, pin your faith upon an English sleeve For the Greek History; you'l not beleeve What the first Voice and Truth it self doth speak, But suspend all untill the Eccho break, Or Report mocks you; how you go on score! The Eccho tels not all, and Report more: 'Twas Greek at first, that Greek was Latin made, That Latin French, that French to English straid: Thus 'twixt one Plutarch there's more difference, Than i'th' same Englishman return'd from France. And thus thy Father Johnson (since naught can Besides the Sun and Man, beget a Man, Phœbus and He thy (Sire) was hiss'd at still More with the Fools Goose-Tongue than the Goose-Quil; Only 'cause his Theorbo did so much Excell their Crowd, and jarring Cyttern Touch; They quarrell his each line, and yet still so ???? ???????? ???? scapes the Blow. Thus (like Alcides) Tryall shew'd Thee Great, Making thee thrive more by their adverse sweat: Thus when they thought Antæus most cast down, He seem'd to kiss the Earth, but graspt the Crown. They who wrote Tumult; and not Elegy, Did thy quick strain into a Fame defie; Great King of Poets! who didst most of all Rise King when throngs of small Wits sought thy Fall: So He, whose Rayes thou didst transcribe, the Sun Suffers Eclipse to be more gaz'd upon. Thy skill in Wit was not so poorely meek As theirs whose little Latin and no Greek Confin'd their whole Discourse to a Street-phrase, Such Dialect as their next Neighbour's was; Their Birth-place brought o'th' Stage, the Clown and Quean: Were full as dear to them as Persian Scean. Thou (to whom Ware, thus offer'd, smelt as strong As the Clown's foot) hadst led thy Muse along Through all learn'd Times and Authors; thy rich Pen Travers'd more Languages than they read Men; They but to Spain or Italy advance, The Leg, or Shrugg, or to our Neighbour France; Thy Universall Genius did know The whole Worlds posture, and mixt Idiom too. But these, as modern faculties, thy Soul Rear'd higher up, learnt only to controul; In abler Works and Tongues yet more refin'd, Thou wedgd'st thy self till they grew to thy Mind; They were so wrapt about thee, none could tell A difference, but that Cartvvright did excell. Thy fair Converse spake thee like one of those Ancients, who taught parts not to be morose; So mild and affable, each man below Thy Talk instructs, yet with an equall Brow; Discourse draws on Discourse, there's none need fear A Rose-tongue Preface to a Thorn i'th' Eare; They may speak on, for thou cull'st Eloquence From ev'ry Word, and more than they speak Sense: So their Dialogist is still trapt on, And eas'ly learns by Commendation: Nor is this Complement, but Prophecy; Thou praisest first, then mak'st them such to be: From late Abilities Sternness frowns abroad; 'Tis safe while they themselves at home applaud. All thy vast pain and Progress was not such That in each Science thou might'st know so much: As some immure Antiquity, till so They 're cry'd up wondrous Wise, and Useless too: Thy Arts and Knowledge did but all prælude That thou might'st enter Orders, not intrude: How did'st thou Pray! how Preach! how didst thou move Thy Hands and Eyes! they and the Word our Love! These Raptures here are ours, which were before Thy Recreations, pure and fine i'th' Ore; Thy first Conceptions, though they did not chime, Were perfect Verse, and only wanted Rime; For as some said of Grotius, that his Span Was Born past Non-age, and straight cradled Man; So didst thou fansie Thoughts, and at the same Strict hour of day dress them into a Frame. As Hound and Hawk were once a Game for Lords, So these thy Pastime; Copies, like our Words, Sprang cheaply from thee. Then, as others, Great Dar'd Death and danger, So our Champion met In stout Resolves the boldest Errour, then Slaies Knox and Bellarmine, and so's quit agen. Thou knew'st Time could not wait, nor didst delay To ripen Ofsprings, till the Fifteenth Day: Thy Stream ran clear, thou never hadst intent T' awake some abstruse Notions, only meant To puzzle Intellects, such as they write, Who ne'r can English what themselves indite, But like the Times, which trouble Waters clean, Then Catch a Frog, which will prove Stork, and raign. Such Magisteriall Heights do never please The vigorous Eye, but damp it with Disease. O I am lost till some Wise man shall please To open what is meant by ? Such horrid Wit, we need not go to Sea, Only read there a while, and learn to pray: 'Twas writ, not to be understood, but read, He that expounds it must come from the Dead; Get ? undertake to sense it true, For he can tell more than himself e'r knew. Should we but write so here, it were to set Before an Ivory Hall, a Porch of Jet, Which sports with a gay Straw, colour'd like Gold, The Mettall scorn'd, does on the Glimpse take hold; Just as that Madam who threw off the meat O'th' Peacock, as if she th' fair taile would eate. Verse as some say, 's the Lot of Godds; They have No Blessings but what first the Poets gave: Th' Abstruse ones then, serve the Ambrosia up, And this our Ganymede fils out their Cup: Their sullen Numbers are not fetter'd more In Cadence now than chain'd in Sense before. But thy soft Heliconian Dew will slip Like Nectar down, and yet scarce touch the Lip: For, O! how smooth all these contextures glide! Cleane as the face of any first day's Bride! How do they melt the Reader! then asswage! Like holy Passions of the Primitive Age! Thou hast writ so, that nothing else could stir In such calm Orbs, but Thy Behaviour: O for a new Almighty Press, that can After the Poems, but Reprint the Man! VV. Tovvers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the Poems and Plaies of the ever Memorable Mr Will: Cartvvright. I did but see thee! and how vain it is To vex thee for it with Remonstrances Though things in fashion, let those judge, who sit Their twelve-pence out, to clap their hands at Wit; I fear to sin thus near thee; for (great Saint!) 'Tis known, true beauty hath no need of paint. Yet, since a Labell fixt to thy fair Hearse Is all the mode, and Tears put into Verse Can teach Posterity our present grief, And their own loss, but never give relief; I'll tell them (and a truth which needs no Pass) That Wit in Cartvvright at her Zenith was. Arts, Fancy, Language, all conven'd in thee, With those grand miracles which deifie The old Worlds Writings, kept yet from the Fire Because they force these worst times to admire. Thy matchless Genius, in all thou didst write, Like the Sun, wrought with such stayd heat, and light, That not a line (to the most Critick he) Offends with flashes, or obscurity. When thou the wild of humors track'st, thy Pen So Imitates that Motley stock in men, As if thou hadst in all their bosomes been, And seen those Leopards that lurke within. The am'rous Youth steales from thy Courtly page His vow'd Address, the Souldier his brave rage; And those soft beautious Readers whose looks can Make some men Poets, and make any man A Lover, when thy Slave but seemes to dye, Turn all his Mourners, and melt at the Eye. Thus, thou thy Thoughts hast drest in such a strain As doth not only speak, but rule and raign; Nor are those bodies they assum'd, dark Clouds, Or a thick bark, but clear, transparent shrowds, Which who looks on, the Rayes so strongly beat They'l brush, and warm him with a quickning heat, So Souls shine at the Eyes, and Pearls display Through the loose-Crystall-streams a glaunce of day. But what's all this unto a Royall Test? Thou art the Man, whom great Charles so exprest! Then let the Crowd refraine their needless humme, When Thunder speaks, then squibs and winds are dumb. Henry Vaughan. Silurist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr William Cartvvright's excellent Poems. You that think Poets as well may Be spar'd, as Serjeants at th' last day; That at condemning have a Muse, And never Fancy but t' Accuse; Stand pale and sentenc'd at high sense, And rail at Wit i' your own Defence: Say it brings Plagues and Battails still, And think Parnassus calv'd Edge-hill; View the Great Cartwright's spacious Wit, All Instance and Example Writ; Who in his unclip'd Fancy flew To such a dazling height as drew Our little Writers to admire And be instructed too, as Fire Shot from above, commands our Gaze, And does Enlighten as Amaze, Whilst in his brighter Thoughts we mark The height of Clouds, but not their Dark; And he to th' Reader does appear A Chrystall Wit, Solid and Clear; Whom no sowre Critick can impeach, And yet less than a Critick reach, Unlike those Wits that losing sight, (Like Birds unseen in their tall flight) As Land-flouds high and Muddy flow, And stand on Tiptoe 'cause th' are Low. He flows clean like some new-pierc'd rock, And by himself, the Prophet, struck, Gives Reason to his Fansy still, Himself inspires th' Inspiring Hill, Wittier by no immodest strain, Delights his Reader, does not stain, No Pandaring Pen here taught loose Love, His Quill not pluckt from Venus Dove; Far from Apollo's weaker Prayse, He spoyles no Virgins to make Bayes. Marke his salt healing Jests, by which He rubb'd and kill'd all wanton Itch, And no man durst loosely come nigh A Lip, while his chast tooth was by; He meant his Satyr-wit to coole Our Vice; and as that holy Poole Not till disturb'd about did deale Its health, and only Moov'd did heale; He alwayes ran harmlesse and pure, But being Angred still did Cure. Had this Scene-Wit not met an Age That frowneth down the mourning Stage, That all Dramatick Lawes confutes, And maketh All the Actors Mutes, (Unlike the gallant Roman Time When Fancy was so far from Crime, That two great ruling things seem'd fit For equall Bayes, Conquest and VVit: When if a Consul high had eat, A Poet shar'd and Sung his Meat, Some Wit still in his bosome lay, And's Meale became an Ode next day, When now in Forc'd and last Designe Laureats are faine to plant th'r own Wine) How had it crackt the Rooms, and made Play-seeing th' only London Trade, When if some close-lan'd Citizen Zealous for his Labouring Hen, Had panting for a Midwife run T' help into th' dark his comming son, These Bils had made him stop, and send To bid her Groan till th' Siedge did end, Though of a Boy he lost the hope To heir his Prunes and Castile-soap. And now we Writers too, that think We sprinkle Balme instead of Inke On his lov'd Memory, doe curse The Printers that have made us worse Poets than Mourners, whose sly drift Is, thus to rob us of our Theft; For He unpublish'd did allow Safe Wit t'all Takers, and We now Like Pirats praysing Plate-Fleets, deal, Sadly commend what we would steal.

      <field name="fulltext">To the rich Memory of my Honoured Friend the Learned Author. Sleep in thy Urn, what makes the modest pant, For fear they want: And what the bold Presume they do, but do not hold; Wit which like Geography Takes Bounds and Limit from the Eye Which waites on its Discovery. For some have gone Up to the Torrid and the Frozen Zone, But there expire By too much Frost, or too much Fire. Some Phansies flee Like those imbark'd with Ptolomy Who neer the Tropicks Land, and there Or their own Skill, or Tempests fear, And leave the rest to some Columbus-care. Where Wit moves far, but finds the Voyage hard, Something still 'scapes the secret of their Card; But to thy Grasping Comprehensive Brain, Each stream was Main, No winding Mystery thy view withstands, No Art, no Science is thy unknown Lands, What e'r doth rowle 'Twixt Natures either Pole, Within thy search doth all A Temperate Habitable Science fall. Nor do these knowing thoughts unfashion'd pass, In a rude Mass, For want of Fire: Thy Learned Issues to inspire; Nor yet Precipitated come, The swift Abortives of a Womb Ripe for no Midwife but the Tomb, Wit without shape, (As Prisoners) is not born, but doth Escape. And as most things Spring cloath'd from provident Nature's Wings, And at once do Put Limbs on and Apparrell too; As the same Womb without Demurs Breeds Ermins, and with them their Furs: So thou despising Wracks, and Second Spurs, At once dost both Enliven, and Adorne, And thy Fair Thoughts are with their Wardrobe borne; And yet no Rape on disproportion'd Words Thy Brain affords: Nor yet a cold indifferency to hit On all which doth come First, though not come Fit. Our Thought allows Of Language for her Spouse: A Bride which seldome suites, When forc'd as Coy, or Free as Prostitutes. Hence both thy Lyrick and Dramatick Quill, Bath'd in one Still, Breath Soft and Clean, Or in thy Ode, or Comick Scene. Where clear Designes in ambush laid, In just suspense 'twixt Light and Shade, Nor out of Sight, nor are Betrayd. Heap'd plots go wrong, Good Company consists not in a Throng. Then comes a Sight, Which may Amuze, but not Afright, Thou didst not Rage, Like a Mortality upon thy Stage: As those whose Buskin treads so hard, That each their bloudy Scenes discard, Enough to cloy St Innocents Church-yard. 'Tis an Invasion this like his who slew A living Man to draw a Picture true. Then: thou each part severely didst confine, To 'ts first designe, For where mistaken Characters intrude, Each single Actor is a Multitude: 'Tis like his Doom Whose throne turn'd Musick-Room, And was though crown'd heard say, Give us the Fiddle, we our self will Play. M. Lluellin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO The Memory of Master Cartvvright. Crown'd with thine owne Choice Bay, we do not bring Hither our Cheap and humble Offering, As by it we could raise up ought to Thee: There's no Accesse comes to the Deity, By th' Sacrifices, that to th' Altar fall: (The God is worthy of his Honour:) All Those wealthy Vowes not make Him, but confesse: They Testifie the Greatnesse not Encrease. That scorns to owe to the poore Votary: Worth were thence Less, whence it could Greater be. And such is Thine; not born from Others Fame: Parent, and Honour th' art, of thine Owne Name. 'Twere Wrong t' attest it. When th' Sun to's Mid-way Has climb'd, who needs bear witnesse to the day? 'Twere to suspect his Lustre, and betray The Truth, and Evidence of his own Ray. Cleare as That Fire, and High as is that Fire; Which did as That, break forth, as That, aspire, Thine was: Took Wing; disdain'd, and left the ground; Great, and Unusuall, and with wonder Crown'd: Reach'd at, &amp; gain'd the Height; touch'd the bold Thyrse; Made known the Power, and the high Rage of Verse: All, but th' short Life of Rage; (like th'Lightning's Ray, Which shines, and dyes; glances, and darts away:) Thine Lasting was; as that Continuall Fire, Which t' after Ages wakes i'th' Sepulchre: With Fancies (like Night-Triumphs) Once we see: They Shoot, and blaze; but i'th' Presentment dye. Nor was there Light, and Heat alone; but thence, That Act of Both, a Quick, Strong Influence Through all the Parts divided, made them One: Gave to each Part, t' it self Proportion: And to the whole; and, in that Union, Made Life, and Order; Strength, and Beauty joyn. Nor did this active Mind, and Influence Reflect upon it self alone; but thence, (As the Sun's quickning Operation can Perfect the Mass begun, and finish Man;) Informe the Hearers; Raise, and Inspire them, with Those Numbers only; that high, and greater Breath: (As did the happy Thracian's Powerfull Song, Which forc'd the Lion, and his Den along; And plac'd a Soul there:) as if each had been The Issue and the Creature of thy Pen. That Life, which Thou on Others could'st confer, Assume Thy self, and know no Sepulchre: 'Tis to thee, both thy Crown, and Recompence: The Glory, and Reward of Eloquence. Live then, (Great Shade) and 'spight of Time and Death, Take of thine own, another farther Breath. Rich. Goodridge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr William Cartvvright's excellent Poems, collected and published since his Death. Mistake not Reader, 't is not here we come To beg the mercy of thy milder doom: Nor thus amasse our Vote to counterpoise The juster censure, with the louder noise: Or court your breath, to swell our Authors Name, With the slight Almes of a petition'd Fame. Put all your censure on, such as might blast The vizage of a Zealot at a Fast; Be it as deadly as a Judge's dream, That murthers in his sleep; could one quick Beam Shot from your Eye, out-do the Lightnings Rayes, And what that cannot, wither the fresh Bayes: Yet might he scorn your rage, and boldly stand The fury and the tempest of your hand. Look on him well and fully, till your sight Dazled with Lustre, do confess his light: See how he casts a Man-like heat, a fire Not lost in sparkes, but in one stream intire: A gentle friendly flame, like that which shed His Rayes on th' new-born Roman Princes head. Without restraint or fetters, fully free, Great in his rapture, high in Extasie: Yet standing in his Master's reach and Power, A Muse subjected to command and Lure: A Judg'd and Aym'd at Wit, a knowing glance, The happiness o'th' Brain, and not of Chance. No sullen night-cap Vein, which must confine It self to th' tedious Hour-glass, or the Wine; One that is forc'd by Siedge, and is distrest Unto the sad surrender of a Jest; Nor yet a Head of Humour, or of Fit, A Magazeen, or Polyanthea Wit. But pardon me Blest Soul, whilst I invade Thy Name, and mix thy glories thus with shade: Dwarfing thy Stature whilst that I compute Thy grown Colossus by a Pygmy's foot. And if we yet are short, how shall we than That cannot speak the Poet, praise the Man? Paint in what figure, colour, or design, The deep Philosopher or grave Divine? Express him when he held us forth his light, Unridling to us the dark Stagyrite? Whose stubborn knots retain'd their strength, though spred And moulded in a soft and even thread; Where Language he to Sense did reconcile, Reducing Reason unto square and file. Or view him when his riper thoughts did bear His studies into a Diviner Sphere: When that his Voice and Charm th' attentive Throng, And every Ear was link'd unto his Tongue. The numerous preass, closing their souls in one, Stood all transform'd into his Passion. Now would my verse Triumph, and does prepare To feather her dull Wing, with fire, and Air: Impregnated with strong Magnetick force, To follow him in his Seraphick course. But I forbear this Theme, deni'd to men Of common souls, of lay and secular Pen: It is enough if our unhallow'd Laies Stand at the Gate, and Threshold of his Praise. Go forth then Sacred Poet, and Reclaime Thy art to th' old Religion of its Name: Possess thy many Glories, for to thee Belongs a multiplied Eternity: A full and wealthy share, enough to give An Age its Breath, which ('cause 'twas thine) shall live. Declining Poesie from thy Times will write The Noon, and Epoch of her proudest Height. Io. Fell. a m. oxon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr VVil: Cartvvright's excellent Poems, Collected and Published since his death. Thou whose great Soul display'd it self to Fame More to preserve true Poetry than thy Name, Art thus united, that late Times may find What went with thee by what thou left'st behind: In both Divine; though the most Bayes do grow Not from the Parts men have, but those they show; Which some exhibit only to be known By others Breath, even whil'st they breath their own. Thou didst avoid this Path, and from us fly Lest that thy Fame precede thy Memory; Which this thy Posthume Of-spring will uphold, And shall be then most priz'd when 'tis most old: While thou wert standing none could take thy Height, Thy Fall (Great Cartwright) made us feel thy Weight; Whose full Dimension was unknown till dead, So Corps are measur'd when the Soul is fled: Now, he that name's thy Name, builds thee a Shrine, For none will stay to judge who know 'tis Thine.

      <field name="fulltext">To the Memory of Mr William Cartvvright. Sure 'tis no vulgar chance, or common thing When I dare move in publike too, and bring My humble Mite here 'mong the learned Crew Of those, who've wreath'd their Laurels into Yew. And who can now contain to see thy Sun (Blest Cartvvright) setting, and the world undon? To see sick Learning bed ridden, and all Her Nerves so discomposed in thy Fall? That her remaining body can be se'd But a meer Skeleton since thy Soul is fled: Invention's in a Trance, and Fancy sits Benum'd with sorrows Apoplectick Fits: Our Tempe too is desart, and those high Springs of sweet Aganippe are grown dry, Abandon'd by the Nine, who since are said To haunt a new one which their tears have made For thee (admired Cartvvright) where they mourn As if they meant to drown thee in thine Urn. Nor should they weep a Deluge, could th' ingross Their Grief to such a Sum as is their loss: Irreparable loss! for thou didst sit Inthron'd, our chief Commissioner of Wit: Whose Buskin rul'd the Genius of our age, And gave both Life and Lustre to the Stage; Where thy sweet Raptures such impression made, They alwaies conquer'd where they did perswade: The charming language of whose Layes might steep, Teaching the rigid Stoick how to weep; And force the sullen Anch'rit to retire From his damp Cell to thy inchanting Quire. And must all Fancy die, or have this doom To be confin'd a pris'ner to thy Tomb? Awake then glorious Sp'rit! awake, and raise Thy Temples up, while Coronets of Bayes, With all those Trophies due to Poets, spread Their circling branches to surround thy head. See how the Muses flock here to resign Themselves as offerings to the new-built shrine Of thy rich Poems; which shall rear thy Pile 'Bove those aspiring Pyramids of Nile. For as thy famous Colledge has the trust Preferr'd to be the Wardrobe of thy Dust, So hath S. Paul thy Reliques, and shall be A walking Monument both to them and thee; Whose Pious Cœmetery shall still keep Thy Virbius waking, though thy Ashes sleep. Robert Gardiner ex ho. M. Templi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On his Deceased Friend Mr Will: Cartvvright's Poems, now Collected and Published. Summon all Wits that Rome or Greece could boast, And all our own, that are not yet quite lost; Bid the Dramatick come With his whole Wardrobe on, Tell the quick Lyrick now And thundring Epick too That all must come and meet at Cartwright's Hearse; The Author and the Subject of all Verse. Let great Augustu's favour'd Laureat know Here's one wrote Verse as high, though not so slow; Where Horace cannot miss Epods as deep as his; A Wit that ne'r broke loose To reach bold Lucan's Muse; Alwayes brim-full, yet never overflows; Match'd all their Verse, and overmatch'd their Prose. What Arts and Authours in one Vessell drown'd! More in him lost than all before him found; Deep, try'd, Philosophy With best Philology, To brandish, or dispute, To melt down, or confute; All Arts and Tongues by one rich Youth engross'd, How much! how soon! but, oh, how sooner lost! Nor had He these vast Contributions thus To make him swell, but to stream forth to us; He broke no Midnight-Sleep To be, or be thought, deep; His Oyle for others spent, On Publick Errands sent; He out-read most, but out-writ more, and yet Did alwaies teach more than he read or writ. And now, yee Town-Wits, who are still so fierce To vote and drink against all Scholars Verse, Telling us, 'Tis ill writ, 'Tis Learning, and not VVit, It tasts of Oxford—oh That your Verse would do so! Leave, leave, for now Old Oxford's fled, the New Is fitted for such Knowing Souls as You. W. VVaring Esq; A greater Lover of the Author's Memory than his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO The Memory of my most deserving and peculiar Friend Mr Wil. Cartvvright. Amidst their very Tears they'l smile to see Me boldly venture at an Elegie On Thee (sweet Friend) a Subject fit for none But those that have drunk deep at Helicon: For how should I thy high-built Fame rehearse Who hardly can distinguish Prose from Verse? 'Tis a sad Truth — Yet here I must come in; my Interest Will claime as large a Sorrow as the Best: For though my Grief wants Art and Words, yet I Can Think aloud to thy dear Memory; And may (while others Write) to after Times Sing thy own lasting Praise in thy own Rimes. Hen. Lavves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Death of Mr. William Cartvvright, and the now publishing of his Poems. Forgive us His dear shade, that we can write A Funerall verse, and own a grief so light: 'Tis all seven years could do, but thus to break Our stubborn passion, and make Sorrow speak, Struck dumb till now. Methinks our Tears would fain Cement his Dust, and Sighs give Breath again: Whilst such a Fate we weep, as for some less Old Stoicks broke, and durst no more Profess. We mourn not now the Peoples way, as though Our Elegies did out of Season grow In some past Twelve-months, or His memory Could with Black cloaths and Cypress be laid by: Hee's still New loss to Us; Meaner things may Perish at once, Cartwright dies every day. Now help us all ye Powers of Verse, and flow Into his Praise all that Himself could do; For who can write without Him? who durst try To speak His worth, were not His Book so nigh? Where, if our flame do languish we retire To his great Genius, and thence take new fire. No Myst'ry there blocks up the way, no sowre Nor rugged Verse that must be scann'd twice o'r; But his soft Numbers gently slide away, Like Chrystall waters, Smooth, and Deep, as they. Euterpe was his Muse, Ease and Delight Lead us along; we Read as He did Write, Each Poem thus is Play, which yet you'l find To be the rich o'rflowings of a mind Furnish'd with Arts and Authors; what he writ, Was but much-Learning Blossom'd forth in Wit; Which struggled still for Birth, as when Jove's brain With Pallas swell'd, not to bring forth was pain. His stile so pleases the judicious Gown, As that there's something too for Wits o'th' Town: Rough handed Criticks do approve, and yet 'Tis treasure for the Ladies Cabinet. The sturdy Schooleman that spends all his daies On Cobweb-notions drest in barbarous phrase, Charm'd with his Quill forthwith becomes less fierce, And Hercules-like ventures to spin in Verse. They who (worse than ten Inquisitions) do Forbid not only Books, but Learning too, By some strange vertue which these Lines infuse, Submit their Spirit to his powerfull Muse; Which thus, like Manna, to all tasts being fit, Whilst others Love, ev'n They will Pardon it. How may we then admire His serious time, That wrote so well, yet drove no Trade in Rime! If from the Scene and Walks such praise he share, What must he from his Metaphysick chair? There he unriddled that mysterious Book, ?????????? ??? ?? ?????????? plut. in Alex.Which Aristotle made to be mistook; And his deep sense did so exactly tell, Great Alexander knew't not half so well: So were those Oracles utter'd clear and good, Which rude Interpreters make less understood. But who could hear without an Extasie, When with a gracefull conquering presence He Stood forth, and, like Almighty Thunder, flung His numerous strains amongst th' amazed throng? A pleasing horror strook through every limb, And every Ear was close chain'd up to Him: Such Masculine vigour ravish'd our assent; What He Perswaded, was Commandement: A sweeter plenty Rhetorick ne'r knew In Chysostome's Pulpit, nor in Tully's Pew. 'Tis yet our comfort, though his Solid parts, The best Divinity and depth of Arts Still buried lye, that now his sprightly Verse Breakes forth, and springs like flowers on his cold Herse. Thus shall he live, and every Line shall have As great applause, as once his Royall Slave: He shall be read as Canon, to express What's Fit and Best in every shape and dress. Whilst all that after come can hope but this, Only to learn how much they write amiss. Ralph Bathurst. Trin. Col. Oxon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Death of Mr Cartvvright, and the Life of his desired Poems. No more, Mad Heretick, no more deny That blessed Hope which makes us glad to dye, Dispute no more the Faith of that great Day Shall free dead Mankind from their gloomy clay; See here an Arg'ment will stop all your lies And kill the putrid Gangrene—See Cartwright rise! Great, and lov'd Cartwright! who alive could quell All Hydra, and subdue each Limb of Hell, Here triumphs after Fate, whose Iron strength His springing Lawrell hath broke through at length, And in the Resurrection of his Name And Wit secures unto his Dust the same: Whose every Atome shall collected rise As sure, as these immortall Elegies. For 'tis not more that dry bones then should grow And live, than 'tis for Arts and Learning Now, And buried Ashes may as eas'ly see Theirs, as we this glad Palingenesie. Oh! bid him welcome from his fragrant Urn, You Sons of Phæbus, thankefull Odours burn, And bring large Heaps of Spices, that the Flame May spread, and shine, in which your Phænix came; It will be prudent piety to give Kind Rites to Him, in whom your selves will live, And on the towring Columns of his Praise Build your own Fame, and your own lustre raise. See! He looks pale and pensive still! but This The Scholars Grace, and chiefest Beauty is; Allow them paint and washes for their Skin (Those grosser Orn'ments) that have none within; Bright Orient formes live here, though they retreat, And for the Cheek choose a Diviner Seat; Where they inthroned grow, and bloom as fair As the sweet Buds which uncurst Eden bare, And deck his Mind, and Book so, as to be The Muses Paradise, and their Rosarie. Then, do not blame his serious Brow and Look, 'Twill be thy Picture if thou read his Book: And every Line of noble sense drawn there Reflects on thee no less of Grief, and Fear: Just Grief for his vast loss; and then as much Of Fear, no Age will boast another such. False vacuous Births in every street we see, But seldome, true and ripen'd, such as He; Whose Numbers were so full, that he alone Had been an Oxford, had we wanted one; Which till He fell we could not; for he stood 'Mong all her Sons the Hector of her Bloud; Sweet Diggs, and Masters, graver Aglionby, And, their Forlorn Hope, my dear Aldersey, Were all legitimate Branches, and her Heart When rob'd of Them, was pierc'd with tender smart; But when her Cartvvright went, it broak; and Men Observe She never was Her selfe since then. Since then She sits wasted in Sighs and Grief, And cries her Ruins are beyond relief. Sh'as lost her Sons, and lost their Father too, And this Compleates, and desperates her Woe. No Rachel, nor sad Niobe, like Her, Who seeks and begs, yet finds no Comforter; Nor ever shall 'tis doubted more, unless Perhaps from this her Joseph's Coat and Dress. This may revive, and call her up again, Who else had vow'd no smiles to entertain, But weep her Eyes out on the Tragick Grave Of her best Cartvvright, and his Royall Slave. Mat. Smalvvood</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Death of Mr William Cartvvright. So! we are now beyond the spleen of Fate, Our miseries have made us fortunate: The Grave was Physick here; Death speaks us free, Her malice now is spent as well as we; Nay, now our ruin doth so much displease, That to strike more is to her a disease. None can deserve her Envy, her Contempt Exceeds her former anger, she hath spent No Arrows but on precious lives, and we Are but the leavings of her tyranny: Such, whom when she hath taken from the Prease Cannot requite the Expence of a disease. He fell a nobler ruine; we that live Owe our short lives, but to a base Reprieve. He, when as yet in death he was not lost, Made Fate suspect her Jurisdiction crost, 'Cause Learning knew no destiny; 'twas He Whose Studies bordered on Eternity. Our Speculations were too poor to have With thee the equall glory of a Grave, And share a fair mortality that we Might be thought wise, because we fell with Thee. Death had thee hence, lost thy large Phansy might In time take Wing, and with a saving flight Rove Thee beyond the World into a State Too high, and so outrun the reach of Fate. Thou wert so richly good, so great, that we The Church in Thee ev'n at one view might see; Saints that so long possess'd the quiet Earth, And slept out Centuries, were at thy Birth Regenerate, They liv'd again in thee, And did out do their former Piety: And as their Souls contracted in thine own Did thus forestall the Resurrection, So in thy Death they met a second Fate, Nature in Thee did recapitulate. So fraught wert thou with Learning, that we can Stile Thee almost a breathing Vatican, A Library not fram'd of stone and wood, But animate and Cemented with bloud: All Arts so suffer'd in thy Fall, that We May call thy Grave an University, And look our Schooles out there, as if that now Eternall Bodley did descend below To gratifie thy Dust. O! that we might Install thee Lecturer again, and right The injur'd Metaphysicks like to be Eclipsed with their own obscurity Robb'd of thy Light: and yet they are content To mourn the ruine of their Ornament. When He did read, how did we flock to hear? Sure some Professors became Pupils there: He would refine Abstractions, it was He That gave the Text all its authority; As if the Stagyrite resign'd his Pen, And took his Censure, not his Comment then: And though with some the Science goes for pelf, His Lectures made it to transcend it self: He us'd the Creatures as a Scale to storm The spirituall World, and though 'twas torn, And broken with uncertainties, yet He By Reason as by Faith a Deity Could apprehend and reach. Thus having trac'd These secondary things, his soul made haste To view the Cause, and there began to plod, Nothing being left to puzzle him but God; Whose Mysteries he reach'd, as far as He Of his great self had made discovery: He plunderd not the Heavens, nor brought he down Secrets from thence, which were before unknown: Yet some there are beleeve their Wits so ripe, That they can draw a Map of the Arch-Type, And with strange Opticks tutor'd they can view The Emanations of the Mystique Jew; In this his pious Ignorance was best, And did excell his knowledge of the rest: But he is gone, and Providence took him To add to Heaven another Cherubim. This to our Tears may minister relief, 'Tis his Preferment, that does cause our Grief. Tho. Vaughan. è Col. Iesu. Oxon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon Mr Cartvvright and his Poems. 1. Great Queen of Shades bring here thy Flowers: Cut down Elysium to make Bowers For this sad Hearse: when that is done, Then weep thy self into a Tomb. 2. Fates, tear your Books; no more's to do, Unless you can Create a-new Out of this Chaos: Cartvvright's dead, And with him the World's Soul is fled. 3. Number by which all things were made, Is now it self turn'd to a shade; Nature must needs pine away, To see her Masterpeece but Clay. 4. His hand could motion so dispence To guide ev'n an Intelligence, The Sun might not thus neerer come, And burn the World before its Doome. 5. Who now shall tell us when we Love? Sing all those pangs and Sighs we prove When we enjoy; which sweeter Look, And are more reall in his Book? 6. Beauty, which is Gods Excellence, He made the object of the Sence: Nature was troubled; She ne'r knew The Rose and Lilly which he drew. 7. Love's Arrows often do recoile From rocky Hearts without a Spoile; But thy sure Quill still wounding sped, And Virgins kiss'd it as they bled. 8. Those mortall Powers he did out-flie, Courting sometimes Æternity: Unless that bliss were infinite, Heaven had not past his Scheme of it. 9. Plato would say the Gods have Ears, Who left the Musick of the Spheres, Wishing he oft had faulty been So he would thus confess his Sin. 10. These are but ashes of his fire: He tun'd Philosophers to his Lyre; Where thoughts when down he pleas'd to set, They, like the Trees, in Numbers met. 11. He Aristotle has unbent, Made Musick, what he riddles meant, Cloath'd his own Reason, like his playes; His Metaphysicks Claim the Bayes. 12. But he, and Stotevile (that Great Pair) No longer could breath this dull air: Nor need they Pyramids: who thus dye, The Ground it self lifts to the Skie. 13. Pictures are drawn by mystick Art, To naked Eyes that shew no part; But if you put a Glass between, Then all the Curious Lines are seen. So look on Cartwright's dust (though ne'r so far) Through these few Papers, you'l behold a Star. Fr. Palmer Student of Ch. Ch. Oxon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr Cartvvright's Incomparable Poems published after his Death. Let Times grow ne'r so bad, that none can thrive, When most men break, Poets we see can live; And their unbridled Muse securely run Undaunted through the rage of Tax or Gun: Thus midd'st the wither'd Trees 'tis alwayes seen In Winter-time the Laurell holds up green: Verse made Apollo's self so often told For Youth and Wisdome, and yet never old: 'Mongst all the Helps of Art and Natures care, 'Tis the true Poet only makes you Faire; Nay, I have heard some say, ('tis none of mine) No Verse no Text, no Poet no Divine; As if a meer bare Sermon nothing claimes Unless 'tis usher'd in betwixt two Psalms. A comely madnes sits upon the brow Of a well-temper'd Poet; Madness now In other men is Sin, Disease, but here It graces, not infects the Part that's clear. Then let's embrace what Cartwright does bequeath, But he's not dead, for here we see him breath: Or if we grant him gone, he's only ta'ne To set a Spoak i'th' Wheel of Charles his VVayn. Geo: Hill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On M. Will: Cartwrights Incomparable Poems. In the great Crowd whose hands are fill'd with Bayes, To adde unto the Noise, not to thy Praise, I humbly press to bring My Offering: And though thy Worth for the best Wits doth call, Yet none gives more than he that doth give All; Which to the World may show How much I owe; For I can Wish, Admire, and dare profess Though some say more, I did not VVonder less. 'Tis a hard Task exactly to rehearse Whether thou couldst doe more in Prose or Verse; Thy Words untun'd were sweeter Than Other's Meeter; For as thy Verse had Pleasure, Strength, and Sense, So thy Discourse had Depth and Eloquence: This pleas'd the Wise, the Young Ador'd thy Song; Both had attain'd their Height, for These and Those, Thy Verse was the best Verse, thy Prose best Prose. But he that speaks the honour of thy Muse, Must say 'twas such as Lavves himself did chuse, Whose all-performing Soul Intire and whole Follow'd thy flowing Language up to th' Brim: As he were born for Thee, and Thou for Him: The Musick of thy Wit, Thus tun'd and hit, Will make thy precious Name advance and spread As far, as long, as men can sing or read. J: Cobbe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the setting forth M. Will: Cartwrights Poems. Poets let fall your Pens, or write with Feare, You're bound t' expect the censure of each Eare; All modern Wits must blush away a Praise, And silent rather hid, than crown'd with Bayes, As naked Adam did with Fig-leaves doe: So Poets must have Lawrell aprons too To cover, not adorn, so that that Tree Must now their Shaddow, not their Glory be: For Cartwright is reviv'd, whose Verse alone Shewes others guilty of Presumption; 'Twas sin to write, for yet there was a Fall Of Wit, which most Works to the Fire did call, But Cartwright has redeem'd; whose Book thus writ, Declares the Resurrection of Wit. And as Seth's Pillars in the Deluge stood, Which told there was a World before the Flood, And prov'd th' effect of Mankinds liqu'rish Crime, Declaring too th' Antiquity of Time: So by thy Works Posterity shall know The merits of thy Age, before the Flow And Deluges of Blood, which Wars did bring T' orecome the World, and drown the Muses Spring. Reare we thy Book Wits Statue then, to keep Thy Memory, as Soul from cloudy sleep; That as by 'n Obelisk rich and lasting, we May know thy Glory and Æternitie. Rich: Iles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Memory of Mr VVilliam Cartvvright. VVhere shall we enter in, Or how begin To speak Three men in one, And all three gone? Lost all at once, in the same Sepulcher Lies the best Poet-Priest-Philosopher. 'Tis Cartvvright; it can be None else but He: Name but his Third part now, And scarce that too; For his Divine and Metaphysick waies Are left for stronger Wits and better Daies. See how his Laurell grows, Smooth, high, and close, Unblasted, un-cut down, Unpropt, Alone; For all these Supplements, which seem to raise, Come here to gather, not to offer Bayes. Then view his Youth, think how That Virgin Brow Could beare so vast a Weight, Unwrinkled by't; Whose Soul, like Alexander's, fill'd the Sphere, Conquer'd the World before his Thirtieth year. Yet all his Fansies Power Made him not sowre; (Like Moses) he stood out As meek, as stout; For, he that doom's and blast's what others writ, Is some Translator, but no kindly Wit. Mark (if you can) the Pace Of his fleet Race; His Muse does all so swift, All at one Lift: So the brave Hebrew Dames, themselves, gave Birth, And without others Midwifry brought forth. But though all early came, Nothing's born lame; No Fansie's hid, enclos'd, Nor Want expos'd; But as great Julius with one Laurell-bough Conceal'd his Baldness, and recrown'd his Brow. Where are they now that cry No Poetry; Who since themselves miss'd it, Will damn all Wit; Such dull grim Judges, were it in their Power, Would leave nor Heav'n a Star, nor Earth a Flower: E. Nevill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Memory of the deceased Author Mr William Cartvvright. 'Tis a bold work to fall on Riming now When (Cartwright) thou art gone who taught'st us how: Thou wert both Card and Pilot, 'twas thy Hand Steer'd all our Wit as free from Rocks as Sand; From running low on Shallowes, or Aside, Why, when, and where, to anchor, and to ride: But now, without thy Rules, we creep about Like Sea-men e'r the Load-stone was found out. And yet wert thou alive we should not write, Our Little would be None in thy full Light; Men would keep up their Palates for thy Muse, Tasting us but to know what to refuse, (And who would scribble, never to be read?) So whether thou art still alive or dead We should forbear. But yet wee'll trespass on, If but to tell the World that Thou art gone: O could we mourn thy Fall with such a Verse As thou didst powre on honour'd Johnson's Hearse! An Elegie so high and wisely writ, It shews who is and who is not a Wit; Which had He liv'd to read, He had defi'd All the mad World, having Thee on his side; For Thou so praisest Him, thy Eulogy Still dwels on Him, and yet rebounds to Thee; Thine and His Temples jointly Crown'd: elsewhere Thou outwrit'st Others, but thy own self there. VVil. Stanton Esq;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr William Cartvvright excellent Poems. VVe who at Thy Departure could not mourn, Have got up Rimes to welcome thy Return: 'Tis the World's fashion now, each Rising Sun Makes Fooles as fast as Cowards to come on. Thou hast restor'd us; we were since thy Fall More lost by Comets, than no Light at all: False Fires; from Wit and Learned Skill as farr As the most Mountibank Astrologer. Yet these so throng'd, so Epidemick grown, Captains and Poets made up half the Town; Scribling as madly as the other fight, As if they try'd how scurvy they could write; Who first themselves, and then the World, deceiv'd; Which, possibly they might have Wit, beleev'd: But now, when seen and air'd, they are undone; So Moores grow black by coming into th' Sun. But am not I so too? I raile and curse This Riming Age, yet help to make it worse: Can that be Wit in Me that's Fool in Them? 'Tis true: but yet when Cartvvright is the Theam 'Tis a hard thing not to have Poetry; Hee's sadly dull that cannot write on Thee. And yet we write not, though we do; for here None will read Ours because thy Book's so near; (And he that's never read, hath never writ;) Tis dangerous to stand too near a Wit. R. Mason.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr William Cartvvright's excellent Poems. And why not I? 'tis now within my Reach, May not I write as well as others preach? The Eare and Eye may equally dispense Verse without Wit, as Sermons without Sense: And, in good sober sadness, as 'tis made, The Riming work is much the harder Trade. Cartwright, till now, we could have dress'd thy Shrine; For 'twas but stealing some good Peece of thine; Swear it our own, subscribe our names unto't, And heretofore they made no bones to do't, Who having robb'd thee, cry 'tis Scholar's Wit; And then the needy Gallants think th' are quit: (So the Arrested Knight told Standers-by, These are poor Folk, they come to beg of me.) Thus Johnson is decry'd by some who fleece His Works, as much as he did Rome or Greece: They judge it lawfull Prize, doing no more To him, than he to those that dy'd before; Why do they then let Merchants Ships go free, Who but translate, worse Ware, and worse than He? These East-and-West-Translators, not like Ben, Do but enrich Themselves, He other men. But Thou, nor this, nor those, wert all thine owne; Thou didst correct old Witts, but pillag'd none. Thy Wit liv'd free, free as a good man's Mind; May Poems, but not Poets, be confin'd. Fra: Vaughan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On M. Cartvvright and his Poems. You'l think it strange to see my Name in print, Subscrib'd to Verses, and there's something in't Deserves your Admiration; for you see, I am what Nature ne'r intended me: Without a slumber on the forked Mount Cartvvright makes Poets. On the same accompt You may be greater, loftier if you please: Who reads his Strains may write pure Sophocles. An Author of such Fame that ne'r did sow Wit in that Field, where Judgment would not grow: Nor can we hear the Musick of his Verse, But leaving Earth we straight with Heaven converse. If we must use as Mortall what we have, And as Immortall, keep what Fortune gave: This Treasure left us in his Lines, will be Pledge of his Worth to all Posterity; And prove the riches of his Mind, though crost By an untimely Fate, can ne'r be lost. 'Twill be preserv'd, though not in glorious Tombs, In Libraries, which are more noble Rooms. Yet I conceive if this, this precious Book (Thy Magazine Learn'd Cartwright) had been took Amongst the Spoiles to Alexander brought, When with Malignant Starrs Darius fought, His richest Cabinet had made a Shrine For Homers Iliads, and these Works of thine. Hen: Davison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr Cartvvright's Poems Now collected and Published. Iust as the Mind departed rears her Frame, Combines and Trims Her scatter'd Limbs: Gathers her self, and is once more the same: Her All does Spring and Dart, Through All, and every part: Is in this Member All, yet no where Lame. So does great Cartvvright's quickning Fire Shed it self through, knit, reinspire His Rapsodies, and owns the Bulk: His Vein, Diffus'd alike through All, and Every strein, In a just Volume Lives, And the whole Cartvvright gives. As when we view an handsome Feature nigh, Each Members Draught Agrees in nought But this, that each apart does take the Eye: And though each part that's Linkt Is Beauteous, and Distinct, We find a Fresh one i'th' Composure Lye. So do I find great Cartvvright's Art The same, and severall in each part: His Garbs as numerous as his Poems: and In each him Other still, still Cartvvright stand: Each Verse gives all his Air, And yet the whole's more Fair. He sings: and Streight our Thoughts are his, not Ours: What's in our Souls His Verse Controuls; We quit our Minds, and he Commands our Pow'rs: He shuffles Souls with us, And Frames us Thus or Thus: We change our Humors, as his Muse her Flowers; If she Laments, we're pleas'd and weep, She's Blith, we (captive) Triumphs keep; Shee's Grave, wee're so: If she great Princes wooe, The Poets Lines are High and Mighty too. His Muse flies every where, Yet we our selves find There. Masculine and Nervous are thy streins, (Great Soul:) Each Thought of Thine Makes us Divine; And bids us Pledge o'th' Fount a full Crown'd Bowl; Rich, Deep, yet Understood, We Swear, not Thou, Tis Good: Pow'rfull to take all judgments, none Controul. Nimble Apollo gain'd the Bay, But thou the Nymph her self away: And all the Muses hanging on thy Lire, Feel through their Veins now first an Humane fire, And Alone Cartvvright will The whole Parnassus fill. Tho. Severne Ex æde Christi. A.M. Oxon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr Cartvvright's Poems. Draw neer poor hungry Mortals to this Shrine, Whose Muses, like Paul's-Men, on Statues dine: Whose hide-bound Fancies never act their smiles 'Less fed with Giants, and Enchanted Isles. Taste Cartvvright, whose admired Language can Un-phlegme the dulness of an Alderman, Whose gross conceit could not arive at sense Higher than that which appertains to Pence: Here's One will make him write beyond Receiv'd Of such a One the Sum—I say Receiv'd. Here's Wit Stenography'd. No Compass steers A Course unknown to Him: He coasts the Spheres; For what Platonick Spencer did unfold, Or smooth-tongu'd Carew to the World hath told, What came in reach of Fletcher's searching mind, Or Beaumont's towring Brain could ever find, What other heads, who must unchristen'd go, Like Zanies to the Wits in Folio; All their rare Arts our Author does display: All Stars mix here, and make a Milky-way. He sweetly guides the nimble Lyrick feet, And makes the thundring Epicks aptly meet, Charm'd by his Numbers Waves forget to land, Times Wheels are trig'd, and brib'd to make a stand: Let other Fancies draw the Body whole, Our Poet's Pencill can pourtray the Soul. Now as a Lady does disdain to pull Of ev'ry Flower in a Garden-full, But rather in one Rose delighted finds The sev'rall glories of all other Kinds: So do thou Reader by this Book; since here's All Wit compriz'd in Pigmy Characters.

      <field name="fulltext">To the Memory of Mr William Cartvvright, On the publication of these His Incomparable Poems How, in this dearth of Wit, could we dispence With that, and scarce presume to covet sense! Till our Green-sickness-appetite, inur'd To Offalls, from thy Brain was fed, and cur'd; And husbanding thy Royall Slave would dine Like men two years beleaguer'd, on one line: Till this Collation taught us riot, we Could feast on two, and surfeited on three; Nor could that heat be found, that might digest So little, in less time than all was dress'd. Now our rash Palate at one meal tasts o're All thy first Viands, and waites new, and more; Which is return'd so amply pleas'd by this, The largess hath out-vy'd our avarice. How had we lost both Mint, and Coyn too, were That salvage love still fashionable here, To sacrifice upon the Funerall Wood All, the deceas'd had e'r held deer and good! We would bring all our speed, to ransome thine With Don's rich Gold, and Johnson's silver Mine; Then to the pile add all that Fletcher writ, Stamp'd by thy Character a currant Wit: Suckling's Ore, with Sherley's small mony, by Heywoods old Iron, and Shakespear's Alchemy. Yet though thy modesty would ne'r submit To antiquate a custome so unfit, Some kinder hand, would not thy Bayes should be A prey to mean fires, that was lightning free Since Daphne, though un-sun-burnt from that shape, Had but chang'd ravishers, not shunn'd the Rape. But we enjoy more than thou wouldst bequeath, Those scatter'd leaves united in this wreath; Where we may read deep Judgement well express'd, Matter strong limb'd, well ayr'd, and richly dress'd. No rude unchaste Errataes that may set A deeper paleness on thy ashes yet, Thy salt foments no itch where e'r it hit; The Priest may own all that the Poet writ: Words here not press'd, serve at their own expence, No Language rack'd, till it confess thy sence; Which is throughout so genuine, and good, All it can beg, is, to be understood.

      <field name="fulltext">Upon the Memory of Mr William Cartvvright and his admirable Poems. Among the splendid ornaments that crown An Age, and to a Nation add Renown, Is he whom great Apollo hath inspir'd With Sacred gift of Poesie admir'd; Whose charming measures and harmonious straines, Have power to free the Captive Mind from chaines Of savage ignorance, and to restore The civill Customes of the Age of Yore. When such did live, and taught their learned Rimes Among us here, then happy were the Times, Made famous by their Poets Laureate; But now the Age grown more degenerate, True Vertue fades, and Learning is contemn'd, While by unletter'd ignorance condemn'd, Those worthy Labours unregarded lye; Nought is cri'd up, but what the Vulgar frie Of tipsie Cupid-Rimers little worth In haste to please the Multitude bring forth; And now a fatall night draws on apace While pensive Poetry in sad disgrace Bewailes the close of such a glorious day, And all Arts seem short-liv'd in her decay. But see where now appears another Morn, Whose dawning rayes great Cartvvight doth adorn, He whose high raptures not unjustly 'aspire To equall Linus or the Thracian Lyre; Teaching sowre Hyppocrites that falsely 'accuse The wholsome precepts of the innocent Muse, To cease their rayling envy, and to love Th' admired gift of sacred Pow'rs above. Hail honour'd Bard, in thy Great Name reviv'd, And by thy Learned Works made longer liv'd; Born to rebuke the vices of the Age, And vindicate the honour of the Stage; For which we owe what cannot be repay'd, Only Ingratitude to be essay'd: Nor can we truly thy true worth express, Lest we should derogate by an excess; Yet joy, receiving so much light from thee As gives new beams to fading Poesie, And like th' Astronomer, who, by his Art Numbring the Constellations part by part, Some new Star having in the heaven espy'd, Worships it more than all the Stars beside; Thus we, great Cartvvright, do adore thy Name, And triumph in the Conquest of thy Fame, Who hast obscur'd the rout of Poetasters, That in thy Art presuming to be Masters, Dishonour'd Phæbus, and his heav'n-born Quire, Arraying Poesie in false attire. You then who have in silence mourned long, The want of one whose true inspired Song Could teach you all the Charmes of lofty Verse, His labour'd and well-wov'n lines rehearse, Stor'd with a certain power to give relief, And take away th' occasion of your grief: Where you may also see Art joyn'd with Wit, So to refine and polish what he writ, As not to swell with Sentences that rise Like mounting Waves in fury to the Skies. Yet creep they not, but with Majestick pace Keep just decorum, and a comely grace. His Scenes are harmless, not with such a strain As barks at Vice more in it self prophane, Nor made to raise the Vulgar's præsent laughter, But to be read, and be esteem'd hereafter. Thus honour'd Cartvvright, maugre envies rage, Thou here shalt live the glory of thy Age, For now thy Memory shall here inherit The praise belonging to thy ample Merit; Which all succeeding Times will joy to see Crown'd with such Wreaths of Immortality. I. P.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vpon the Author's decease, and Poems. 'Tis treason to thy dust, to praise thy name, (Immortall Cartvvright) whose unwieldy fame No single hand can graspe; since he that wou'd Speak thee aright, and shew how great, how good, Should be himself as much as thou or more, He that would well describe, had need stand o'r. Wert thou not dead, I hardly should suppose The Wits could be so disingenuous Each individually to erect On his own strength, a single Architect To thy Undying Name, since 'tis a task Would take a Synthesis of Wits, and ask An universall Genius, all glory That's less than that, is but derogatory. I'll only bless our Fates, that do derive Thy Soul to us in that which does survive; And thereby made us Competent to sit Tenants in Tayl to Poetry and Wit. Thus when at last th' unmated Phænix dyes, Out of his Ashes does a second rise, The toylsome silk-worm thus, when labour's done Dissolves her self into an only Son: The difference is, those produce single things, But from thine Issue a whole Myriad springs, To populate the world; and make us be Wits by a Lineall Genealogy. So 'tis decreed, spite of Fatality Poets, like Kings, shall never, nor can dye. Alexander Brome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Memory of Mr Cartvvright, and on his Incomparable Poems. Dart up one Glance to Heav'n, and then you'l see How all the lesser Stars of Poesie Contract their Beams, and ev'ry Ray entwine, And all that Stock of twisted Light resign To Cartwrights nobler Blaze, who his Retreat Did in such calm yet various Numbers beat, When both the Sock and Buskin did appear With interlaced Feet to interfer, Posterity from these shall safely call Only his Phansy Epidemicall, And Wits best Epoche shall henceforth be Christen'd alone from his Nativity; Survey his Royall Slave, and then you'l find (Though pent in Flesh and Fetters too) a Mind So even and so fixt, and every Thought To such a comely Shape and Order wrought, Not crooked or Eccentrique in its Parts, All its Designs well knit, so fair its Arts, That He this universall Suff'rage craves, He only free appear'd, all others Slaves; Dissect his other Phansies, 'twill appear The Skeleton o'th' Matter every where Is cloth'd with Sense so sinewy so compact, Not witty loose Lines, or vitious Numbers slack'd; We must conclude that when he did indite He wrought as well t' instruct, as to delight, And sought the Understanding to endear, As well as to captive or charm the Eare; Thus like some publique Genius he did throw Both Light and Influence here on us below, Who being broke now, like some generall Soul That through each Limb did active Vigour rowl, From our benighted Orb, and fixt a Star To guild the Spheres above, He from afar Still points his Beams to us, that by their Light We after him our Archetype may write; So that when after-Times perhaps shall meet Phansies that move on soft and easie Feet, They'l straight cry out, though others did dispense The Words, twas He that only gave the Sense: Thus the whole World it self should grow to be To him at length but as one Legatee; And all our best Acts but as Copies full Transcrib'd from him their fair Originall.

Clear up Thalia, wipe thine eyes, and sing Thy Patrons Resurrection, Come and bring The geniall pack of Sisters hither, now Wee'l all rejoyce, and thank the Fates, that thou Brave Cartvvright art reviv'd: sure death resents Thy Case, she takes 't to heart, and now repents Sh' has cut thy thread: the debt she owes to thee Shee'l pay thy Book to wit) Æternity. Methinks I hear thee breath againe, 'tis here Thou liv'st and mov'st as in thy proper Sphere, What all this while alive, and ne'r come forth Nor walk abroad till now? 'tis fit thy Worth Should be made known to all and not supprest, Nor kept in some close Cabinet or Chest, Where none but Worms can enter, who will feed And live upon thy Wit, though they cann't read. But O take heed ye worms of Cartvvright's Wit, His Lines are strong, you may a surfeit get; You must forbear who can tast nought but Ink, And never deeper than the Paper sink; Your shallow senslesse Teeth must never look To rellish so profound and wise a Book As Cartvvright's is, No meaguer Poet, here You'l find no Drolery, th' effect of Beer And Ale, such stuff the Poet after vents Half drunk, when he speaks nought but Complements, Who racks his Brain, and spends his Wit, and Time, In seeking not so much for Sense, as Rime. Thy Works are full of Life, not like the vain And foolish Embryoes of a giddy brain, That perish in the first Conception Like an unhappy and abortive Son: Who's born a Carkase, and who always dyes Before he lives, comes forth a Corse, and lyes Cradl'd in a Coffin: such sons of Death, Some hasty Wits, when they are out of breath Produce—Thus when the Poet's drunk and reels His Verses in the Birth kick up their heels, They're maim'd within, and crippl'd in the Womb: Come forth all Scazons, halting up and down, Such limping Poetry doe some beget, That staggers ev'ry step for want of Wit.

      <field name="fulltext">Vpon the Incomparable Poems of the Learned Mr Cartvvright. Though some low men by others Verse be rays'd, Who dully write, and will in Wit be prays'd; To usher in his Muse Cartvvright needs none, Panegyrist and Author here are One: Who send him Verses run on score, as some Debtors, by giving to a King, become. Bare Poets think their Title doth high sound Though they doe only own Parnassus ground: Yet you a Poet their whole Picture call, In Cartvvright 'tis but as a nose of th' all. 'Twas he that taught the Passions, which he mov'd, And by him Metaphysicks sense were prov'd. Pulpit and School he reconcil'd, a Man Calvin he made, Stagirit a Christian. Carmenta did her name to Verse impart, In Cartvvright ev'ry letter is an Art. 'Tis true, who gives him but a Poet's Fame, Leaves out above three parts of Cartwright's name; Yet he writes so, that but a piece of's skill. May dub another Knight of th' Muses hill; His winged Fancy was both full and swift, Did fill the Mind, the Passions up lift. There rul'd his Pegasus a ballanc'd head, To run it suffer'd, but to rove forbid. Sufficient Reading Pegasus preserv'd, Not chok'd with much, nor with too little starv'd; Swift but with pomp, and stately in his course, Both like god Neptune's and Apollo's Horse. He not Pyreneus-like did force the Nine, As if his Quill was part of Porcupine, (For Phœbus loves no Wit cut out, though he Of Cæsar's birth the great Protector be) Nor writes he in the Clouds, and a dark Dress, That him you cannot understand, but ghesse; Though he had not much more than Homer's sight, In Verse hee'd Homer's and Eustathius light. Nor writes he venom, as if now again Python return'd and did Parnassus stain. But to their Temple Muses did restore, And thought th' good man, than the good Scholar, more. Who e'r the totall Beauty did once limme, Paints Cartwright; who writes best, has part like him; Below whom all his Imitators fall, That we no Copy, but a Rule him call. B: C: Oxon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Memory of the Incomparable Mr William Cartvvright. Great Soule of Numbers! Treasury of Arts! Mirrour of Invention, Judgment, Parts! Sole Emp'rour, and Dictator of thy Age Over the Schooles, the Pulpit, and the Stage! From whose Decease, succeeding Ages shall Compute, Decay of Wit, and Learnings Fall: Whence this sad Truth, Posterity shall read, Cartvvright, and with Him, all the Muses fled: Excess of Vertue doth thy Vertues soyle: So Lamps extinguish'd are by too much Oyle: Though Time, that grief digests, and lessens woes, Till by degrees the Sense of Loss we lose, Might have asswaged mine; yet still (Great Soul) A sacred horrour doth my Thoughts controul, As if to write of thee were an offence (Though after seven years Respite) and write Sense. As he who fairly laies about, doth show More fury, than the Artificiall Foe That strikes by Rule, and by the Compass fights: So he most sorrow shews, that rudely writes, More mindfull of his Theam than Fame; whilst he That studdyeth Tears, Commends himself, not Thee. Since then Sighs vocall and Articulate But Courtships are, and Complements of Fate: Great Wonder, and deep sorrow are still best In a Religious awfull silence dress'd: As he whose feeble Pencill could not fit Griefe's Features, drew the Curtain over it, By that dark Cypress Veyl disclosing more Than subt'lest Art or Colours could before: So where no Language can thy worth advance, 'Tis best Devotion to plead Ignorance: Inferiour Wits (like foiles) being only set To make thy Diamonds brighter by their Jet.

Not that Thy perfect Verse does need my praise, Nor can I add one leaf unto Thy Bays? The Beauty of Thy Muse admits no stain To set Her off, Her Colours are in Grain, All pure and Clean; So that what e'r might be A Foyl elsewhere, a Blemish were to Thee. Nor do we write to make thy Volume swell Hir'd by the Stationer, that it might sell The better for its Bulk, who so doth see The Title Page, and that 'twas writ by Thee. Will not his Judgement forfeit so to doubt There can be a defect, or ought left out. Thy eeven Numbers with such weight express Themselves, and yet in such an open dress That every one that reads will think th' were writ Only for the Meridian of his Wit: The humorous Courtier and the Scholar may Now jointly read, and both like the same Play; And meerly for their Credits sake, confess That no man could say more, nor Thou say less; Hence then with one consent this suffrage bring, Cartvvright could only make a Slave, a King. No such distinction here, that one from thence May say in this Line's Fansie, in that, Sense, But both so mixt, Nature so link'd with Art, Like the same Soul, they're wholly in each part: Thus shall thy Poems live (Blest Shade) and Fame After Thy Ashes, celebrate Thy Name.

Muses I need you not; for, Grief and I Can in your absence weave an Elegy: Which we will do; and often inter-weave Sad Looks, and Sighs; the ground-work must receive Such Characters, or be adjudg'd unfit For my Friends shroud; others have shew'd their Wit, Learning, and Language fitly; for these be Debts due to his great Merits: but for me, My aymes are like my self, humble and low, Too mean to speak his praise, too mean to show The World what it hath lost in losing thee, Whose Words and Deeds were perfect Harmony. But now 'tis lost; lost in the silent Grave, Lost to us Mortals, lost, 'till we shall have Admission to that Kingdom, where He sings Harmonious Anthems to the King of Kings. Sing on blest Soul! be as thou wast below, A more than common instrument to show Thy Makers praise; sing on, whilst I lament Thy loss, and court a holy discontent, With such pure thoughts as thine, to dwell with me, Then I may hope to live, and dye like thee, To live belov'd, dye mourn'd, thus in my grave; Blessings that Kings have wish'd, but cannot have.

Rhod. Could I see't 'twould prove An Antidote against old Age, and make me Grow younger still without Expence or Art. Pan. You sin past pardon Rhodia, if you doubt it. Cos. The plot's most firm and strong. Pan. The Means advis'd. Cosm. The carriage hitherto successefull; we Gain daily to our side. Rhod. Doe they come in? Pan. As to a Marriage; Offer money, Plate, Jewels, and Garments, nay the Images Of their Male Gods. Cosm. The very name of Rule Raises their Blouds, and makes 'em throw their Wealth Away as heartily, as if they were Young Heires, or old Philosophers. Rhod. Why then, There's one care sav'd Cosmeta. Cosm. What's that pray? Rhod. I was preparing strong Preservatives Against our Lords came home, for fear of fainting At their Arrivall. Pan. They'd have smelt indeed Of Labour, Sweat, Dust, Man, and Victory. Cosm. And such grosse Rustick sents, that a Court nose Without the patience of a Stoick, could not Have possibly endur'd them, Rhod. I believe They'd have encreas'd the Bill, and some would weekly Have dy'd of the Lords Return from the Cretan War: What growth's your Plot of Madam? Cosm. O it ripens Past expectation! See, Besides our selves Puls out a Roll. Eleven Court-Ladies on the Roll already; Hyantha then sends word, that ten, or twelve Very substantiall Countrey-Ladies have Subscrib'd three days ago. Pan. My Province here, The City-wives, swarm in, strive, and make means Who shall command their Husbands first. Cosm. And then Of Countrey Gentlewomen, and their eldest daughters, More than can write their Names; 'Tis now past danger. Rhod. But, Madam, how'l you gain the men at home? Cos. For that brace &amp; half of Courtiers there, Ganyctor, Lerinus, and Iringus, they are mine, Fast in the Net, if I but pitch it only. Rhod. Look where they come, pray sweare 'em presently. Scen. II.

Lerinus, this hath been the worst Spring that I ever knew. Lorin. Faith it has', for Flora Still challeng'd it before, but now Bellona Hath got the time: Roses and Violets were The fruit o'th' Season formerly, but now Laying, and raising Sieges: Building up And pulling down of Castles; Manning, and Demolishing of Forts have sign'd the Months.

'Tis very well my Lord Olyndus then Is left at home. Ler. How does his Lordship now? Still angry that his Majesty would not let His sickness go against the Enemy? Irin. He finds the hardest Wars at home, he hath Visits, and Onsets, that molest him more Than all his griefs. He now complains of health; The eager Ladyes do besiege him hourly, Not out of love so much, as want of men; Any thing now, that wears but Breeches only, Is plotted, and projected for as much As a new Fashion, or an Office 'bove Stairs, Ler. They do call this their time of Persecution, Swear they are living Martyrs. Gan. Then the Punishment Must make 'em so; I'm sure the cause will never. Ler.

No, Sir, I will not do the State that harm; For the Corruption of one Coward must Needs be the Generation of another. Ler. I'll warrant th'Issue will be truly valiant. Rho. And how so Captain Stay-by-it? Pan. Madam, he Can neither fight nor speak: I'll tell you how, That you're a Coward, Sir, is granted: Thus then; Either your Father was valiant, or was not. Irin. A very sure division, Lady, that. Pan. If he were valiant, and you a Coward, 'Tis your Sons course next to be valiant; But if he were not valiant, and that You are a Coward of a Coward, then Your Lineall Issue must be valiant needs, Because two Negatives make an Affirmative. Cosm. A most invincible Argument! Irin. This shall not Serve I assure you, say what e're you will You shall not reason me to your Bed-side. Rho. No, Sir. Cos. Not though we send you Mellons? Pan. Ripen'd Hopes? Rho. Apricocks, Figges? Pan. Vegetable Embraces. Cos. And smooth Epistles? Go you vile abusers Of what you cannot compass; 'cause you nourish Desires, you will discharge the sin on us. Irin. Ladies you're much deceiv'd: had you the Aphorismes Of th'Art perfect, that each word should go With a designe, that not an Eye should be Lift up, or cast down without mystery— Ler. Could you force sighs, faigne passions, manage looks, Season your jests, speak with a Manner still— Gan. Should you consult a Decade of Chambermaids, And sadly advise with your Chrystall Oracles, In which Attire your Beauties would appear Most strong; in what contrivance your sweet Graces Would be most fierce, and overcome Spectators, You should not have one look to quench the fire. Ler. You shall be Vestals by compulsion still— Irin. You shall make Verses to me e're I've done; Call me your Cælius, your Corinnus, and Make me the Man o'th' Book in some Romance, And after all I will not yield. Rho. You're got Into a safe field of Discourse, where you Are sure, that Modestie will not suffer us To answer you in a direct line. Cosm. You were Wont to go whining up and down, and make Dismall Soliloquies in shady Woods— Pan. Discourse with Trees— Rho. And Dialogue with Eccho's— Cos. Send Messages by Birds, make discreet Thrushes Your trusty Agents 'twixt your Loves and you— Rho. Which Loves you call'd Nymphs— Cos. When indeed they were Milkmaids, or some such Drudges. This your rating And prizing of your selves, and standing off, Comes not from any bett'ring of your Judgements, But from your Mouth's being out of taste. Pan. Pray y' what Employment are you fit for? Ler. Ile assure you None about you. Cos. Their whole Employment is To goe Embassadors 'twixt retir'd Ladies— Pan. To ask how this great Ladies Physick wrought— Rho. Give an account o'th' vertue of her Drugs. Cos. Make perfect Audit of the Tale of sighs Some little Dog did breath in his first sleep: Goe you Reproach and Refuse of your Countrey. Gan. You speak most valiantly Heroick Lady. Ler. Pray Venus you permit the Lords to rule The Common-wealth again, when they come home. Pan. Know Sir, they shall not— Cos.

You mean Florina, and Malthora, those that are Sad now, that one day they may be in History Under the name of Turtles. Cos. What Dialect may Those Ladies grieve in? Dorick or Ionick? Doe they make Verses yet? Eum. Their Manners are A kind of Satyr upon yours; though they Intend it not, the people read 'em so. Rho. 'Cause they have laid aside their Jewels, and so Blinded their Garments— Cos. 'Cause they eat their sweet-meats In a black Closet, they are counted faithfull, The sole Penelope's o'th' time, the Ladies Of the chaste Web i'th' absence of their Lords. Eum. Your sadnesse would be such perhaps, if you Would take the pains to shew the Art of Mourning. Rho. Is there another way of grieving then? Eum. This is not grief, but stands to be thought grief: They are not of such vaunting popular sorrow; Their Tapers are not dy'd in dismall hue, And set in Ebon Candlesticks; they wear No sad black Sarcenet Smocks, nor do they smutch Their women, to be serv'd by mourning Faces; This were to grieve to Ostentation, Not to a reall friendship. Pan. Is there friendship Think you 'twixt man and wife? Eum. You'll say, perhaps, You, and your Husband, have not been friends yet. Pan. Madam, you prophecy. Eum. I might be thought t'have done so, Had I foretold a truth to come, but this Is History already. Cos. If they do not this, Nor wear the day out in a hoodwinkt room, Where there's no living thing besides the Clock, Nor yet take Physick to look pale, what doe they? Eum. They grieve themselves, their Doctor grieves not for them: They do that in the Absence of their Lords That you would in the Presence of your own. Cos. You see we look as fat, and fair as ever— Eum. Your Kitchin's warm, your Box, and Pencils fail not. Pan. —VVe are as long in dressing as before— Eum. And have the same Romancys read, the same Letters brought to you, whilst y'are doing it. Rho. —Sleep, and take rest, as then, and altogether Speak as much wit as we did before the wars. Eum. And to as little purpose. Cos. Fie Eumela! That you should be so obstinate, as to hear VVealth, Honour, Pleasure, Rule, and every good Knock at your door, and yet not let 'em in. Eum. Madam, I know my Looking-glasse wo'n't shew The altering o'th' State, when it presents The changes of my Face, and that I cannot Order the Kingdome, as I do my Hair. Enter Florina and Malthora. Pan. Yonder's your business; Madam, there are three Sad things arriv'd, two Ladies and a Lute. Cos. But shall I write you down before you go The thirteenth in the Rowl of the Asserters Of Female Liberty? Eum. If Liberty be the thing You so much stand for, pray you give me mine; I neither grant, nor yet deny; I will Consider. Cos. VVe dismiss you, Madam, then Unto your serious Counsell. Eum. Fare you well. Exeunt Cosm. Pan. Rho. Scen. IV. Eumela goes to Florina and Malthora who are sate in the Grove. Elo. O come, Eumela, thou dost know, without thee Our thoughts are Desarts, Rocks, and Sands, and all That either Nature's absent from, or hath Reserv'd unto her self alone. Eum. I bring you Noise, Trouble, Tumult, and the World; but if There were that power in my worthless presence, That I could cast a day upon your thoughts, You should not think of Places that are sacred To Night, and Silence: Visits still, and Feasts And the whole Ring and Throng of Mirth should stir In your delighted Souls. Mal. Prethee Eumela Is there no secret ancient Grove, that hath Stood from the birth of Nature to this time, Whose vast, high, hollow Trees seem each a Temple, Whose paths no curious Eye hath yet found out, Free from the Foot and Axe. Eum. If I could tell you It were found out already. Flo. Hast thou read Of any Mountain, whose cold frozen top Sees Hail i'th' Bed, not yet grown round, and Snow I'th' Fleece, not Carded yet, whose hanging weight Archeth some still deep River, that for fear Steals by the foot of't without noise. Eum. Alas! These are the things, that some poor wretched Lover Unpittied by his scornfull Shepherdesse Would wish for, after that he had look'd up Unto the Heavens, and call'd her Cruell thrice, And vow'd to dye. Flor. I prethee pardon me; I live without my self. Eum. But I have read Of a tall secret Grove, where loving Winds Breathing their sighs among the trembling Boughs, Blow Odes, and Epods; where a murmuring Brook Will let us see the Brother to our Sun, And shew's another World there under water. Mal. Prethee let's go, and find it out, and live there. Eum. Our Ancient Poet Linus somewhere sings Of some such thing. Mal. Thou alwaies dost deceive us; Thou told'st us of an Eccho too, and when Thou brought'st us to it, thou had'st put Philænis Behind the Wall, to give us all the Answers. Flor. Yes, and thy bringing in my Father's Dwarf With Bow and Wings, and Quiver at his back, Instead of Cupid, to conveigh us Letters Through th' Air from hence to Crete, was but a trick To put away our sadness. But I had Almost forgot what we came for, I prethee Take up the Lute there, and let's hear the Ode, That thou did'st promise us; I hope 'tis sad. The Ode sung by Eumela. To carve our Loves in Myrtle rinds, And tell our Secrets to the Woods, To send our Sighs by faithful Winds, And trust our Tears unto the Flouds, To call where no man hears, And think that Rocks have Ears; To Walke, and Rest, to Live, and Dye, And yet not know Whence, How, or Why; To have our Hopes with Fears still checkt, To credit Doubts, and Truth suspect, This, this is that we may A Lover's Absence say. Follies without, are Cares within; Where Eyes do fail, there Souls begin. Mal. Thou art a harmless Syren fair Eumela. Flor. 'Tis very true indeed; thou feed'st at once, And dost correct our follyes: but wert thou As we, thoud'st do the like. Eum. For Love's sake tell me VVhy should you seek out Groves, where the bright Sun Can make no day, although he throw upon 'em VVhole flouds of Light, Places where Nature will Be blind in spight of Him? VVhy should you fancy Caves fit to write sad Revelations in? Or why a Lover stretcht on shaggy Moss Between two Beds of Poppey to procure One Minut's slumber? Flor. These, Eumela, are not The Journyes but Digressions of our Souls, That being once inform'd with Love, must work, And rather wander, than stand still. I know There is a VVisdom to be shewn in Passions; And there are stayd and setled griefs: I'l be Severe unto my self, and make my Soul Seek out a Regular Motion, towards him VVhom it moves to, and thou shalt shortly see Love bleed, and yet stoop to Philosophy. Scen. V. Olyndus and Charystus toward them. Eum. Madam I must away; Olyndus yonder Is hasting towards me. Mal. Farwell Eumela, Be ever happy. Flor. And may some good God Cherish thy Loves, as thou dost cherish others. Ex. Fl. &amp; Ma. Eum. My Lord Olyndus, what's your bus'ness to me? Olyn. Vertuous Eumela, you must doe me the favour To give this Letter into th' Princess's hands With all the speed and secrecy you may. Eum. I carry with me Night, and wings my Lord. Ex. Cha. O my Olyndus, were there not that thing That we call Friend, Earth would one Desart be, And Men Alone still, though in Company. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENE I. Machessa, Philænis, and after a while Cosmeta, Pandena, Rhodia. Mac. Give me my Javelin; hangs my Fauchion right? Three Ladys sayst thou? So! go fetch 'em in now. What? goes the Tilting on I mention'd? Is there En. Pan. Cos. Rho No Just, nor Turnament yet granted out? Cos. You're well appointed Madam. Mach. How I hate That Name of Madam, it befits a Chamber: Give me the words o'th' Field, such as you'd give To fairer Ladyes pricking o'r the Plains On foaming Steeds. But I do pardon you. Shews not this Scarf and Fauchion far more comely, Than paultry pyebald Ribbands, and young Bodkins? Pan. You wear a rigid Beauty, fierce Delights. Rho. Your Pleasures threaten, and your stubborn Graces Tempt, and defend at once. Mach. Why now y'are right. And what say'st thou, my little Noon-tide shadow? My trusty Pigmy? Phil. Now indeed, and truly— Mach. Hell o' these simpring Protestations! Thou sinfull Inch of short Mortality, Give Ear to my Instructions: here I swear By th' Sacred Order of my Lady-Errantry, If thou effeminat'st thy discourse once more With these precise, minc'd, Little Sisters-Vows, Thy breath is forfeit. Phi. By that bloudy Fauchion— Mach. I there's a Wench, spit from the mouth of Mavors! Bellona was thy Nurse. Phi. —And that fierce Javelin, I'd rather see a Plume o'rshade your back With a large, generous Carelesness; than a bunch Of fidling Feathers hang before you, just As modest fig-leaves do in naked Pictures. Mach. Thou little 'Vantage of Mankind, thou Grain That Nature put into the scales to make Weight to the VVorld, thou tak'st me very much. Phi. The Sable Fan, which you wore last upon Your white Lawn-Apron, made you shew just like The Ace of Clubs, with a black spot i'th' middle. Mac. VVhy how now little Mischief? is't not knavish And waggish, like a very Page o'th' Court? Cos. VVhat use do you mean her for? Mach. Have you not read? To summon Knights from th' tops of Castle wals. Pan. I fancy those brave Scythian Heroines; Those Noble, valiant Amazons like you. Mach. Nature did shew them only as my Types. Cos. There's nothing wanting but adventures: We Shall quickly now requite the Errant Knights That help distressed Ladies to their wishes. Mach. I'l disobliege our Sex. If that you find Any imprison'd, or inchanted Tell him Machessa's his deliverance. Said I Machessa? Hold! that word Machessa Sailes through my Lips with too small breath. I'l have A Name that Mouths shall travell with: let's see? Wee'l put a Prologue to it: So! I have it; It is concluded—Monster-quelling-Woman- Obliging-Man-delivering-Machessa, She, She is his deliverance: tell him so. Ph. Do she that can; I would you'd change your Name; 'Tis longer than your Self, and if it were Some three foot shorter, 'twere as high as I am. [One knocks. Mach. See who 'tis knocks; you do not know your Office; Bellona, hear my Name, and send Adventures. Scen. II. To them Ganyctor, Lerinus, Iringus. Cos. The Courtiers Madam; work for us! remember. Pray stand aside as soon as we begin. Gan. Save you Machessa. Mach. I've a Name besides, By which I mean Posterity shall know me; The word is grown: 'tis Monster-quelling-Woman- Obliging-Man-delivering-Machessa. Irin.

'Cause y'are wont To receive most, and so can tell the newest; VVhich now perhaps you come to have redrest. Rho. VVhat is the strength o'th' Subject think you Sir? Ler. Why what know I? Cos. Who should Sir, if not you That have so oft been beaten by all sorts, And all degrees of men? Pan. Which Lady now Sends you most Favours? Rho. VVhich most Mellons? Cos. Which Most Gums, and Spikenard Boxes? Rho. Who presents you With the best Figs? Pan. The plumpest Bulbi? Gan. You, And you, and you; you will not worry me? Cos. By your Periwig, Captain, but we will. Pan. By your False Teeth we will. Rho. And your glasse-Eye we will. Ler. For Jove's sake, Madam. Irin. S'heart I'm not breath-proof. Cos. Alas, we han't begun yet. Gan. Let's beseech you. Pan. We will not be beseech'd. Cos. Think upon Rest, As a past pleasure of your youth— Pan. You shall not Be idle quietly in the Presence Chamber. Rho. You shan't tell lies in quiet to the Waiters. Cos. Nor, when you've done, share in their meat in quiet. Pan. Wee'l meet you at the Bath— Cos. You shall not wash Without disturbance. Pan. At the Theater too— Rho. You shall not misconceive good Comedies Without vexation— Cos. And at Flora's Park.— Pan. You shall not cheat at little Horse-races Without discovery. Rho. In th' Temple then— Cos.

Come quickly then, lest that Mach. steps in and draws till they all pass out. We take a toy, and will not let you. Mach. Stay. The Gods have destin'd this should be the first Of my Adventures—go—y'are free. Irin. Our thanks Will be too small a Recompence. [Exeunt Gan. Irin. Ler. Mach. The Deed Will pay it self; Vertue's not Mercenary: Or, if it be, mine is not. So; I do Begin to come in Action now. To do And suffer, doth engross whole Nature, and I will engross both them; I'l set all free, But only Glory; her I'l Captive lead, Making her Trumpet only sound my Name, That is, the Sexe's. I am all their Fame. How goes your Bus'ness on? Pan. Vertue and Fortune Joyn in it both. Cos. Eumela is come over, Hath undertook the Machin, and hath promis'd To bring it to that pass, that neither Queen, Nor Princess shall gainsay't. Florina, and Malthora both have given in their Reasons, Which I have answer'd, and convinc'd. Mach. If that It come to any danger, let me know it. Exeunt Mach. Phi. Scen. III. To them Eumela. Rho. Eumela welcome; does your bus'ness thrive? Eum. Too fast. Cos. What? have you sent to th' Ports? Eum. All's safe. Machessa's ours you say— Pan. Yes, and Philandra. Eum. Cleora and Earina busie Sticklers, Oenone and Hermione sent as Emissaries To try the farther Cities—Paria hath A pretty stroke among the Privy Chamber. Cos. You've lost no time. Eum. Nor will, Cosmeta— Psecas, and Dorcas, Cloe, and Plecusa, Phillis, and Glauca, swore this morning all As I was dressing. Rho. On what Book I pray? Eum. On the Greek Epigrams, Madam, or Anacreon, I know not which: they bind alike. Cos. What hopes Have we o'th' Women of Lapythia? How stand the Dames of Salamin affected? Eum. Why Lycas sent to give them a fair Largess Of Loaves and Wine, &amp; then, whiles that well cheers 'em, Eugenia brings 'em a most promising Answer From some corrupted Oracle, and so leads The superstitious Souls to what she pleaseth. This is a ground, a thing suppos'd. The Plot Is wholly now upon Florina, there It knits, and gathers, breaks, and joyns again; She's Wise, and Noble—we must find a way Not thought on yet to gain her. Pan. But the Queen And Princess— Eum. They perceive the business ripens, That it doth move the limbs, and can for need Shift, and defend it self, and therfore doe By me make promise of a generall meeting As soon as may be: i'th' mean time, we have Full leave to gather any Contributions, Gold, Silver, Jewels, Garments, any thing Conducing to maintain the Publique Cause. Omn. Goddess Eumela! Eum. Goe, fall off, the Princess Is at hand—I'l goe mingle Counsels. Exeunt Cos. Rho. Pan. Scen. IV. Lucasia to Eumela. Luc. Eumela you are come most opportunely. Eu. This to your Highness from my L. Olyndus. [delivers the Letter.] Luc. You're happy that your Love is with you still, That you can see, and hear, and speak to him. Venus doth favour you more than the whole Kingdome Eumela; Mars for her sake 's kind to you. Eum. I must confess it happy: but Olyndus Cannot be brought to think it so; he fears His sickness will by some be constru'd Love; Which, if his Valour in his Country's danger Durst give the upper hand, ev'n at the Altar, Though Venus did her self look on, hee'd pull Out of his Breast, and cast aside, as some Unhallow'd part o'th' Sacrifice. Luc. His King Hath found him truly valiant. E'r I open This Paper, you must state one Point, Eumela, Suppose me busie in the holy Rites Of our adored Venus: if by chance I cast mine Eye upon some Princely visage, And feel a Passion, is the Goddess wrong'd? Or the Religion lesse? Eum. Our Loves what are they But howerly Sacrifices, only wanting The prease and tumult of Solemnity? If then i'th' heat and Achme of Devotion We drink a new flame in, can it be ought But to increase the Worship? and what Goddess Was ever angry that the holy Priest Increas'd her Fires, and made 'em burn more clear? Luc. True, but suppose the Face then seen doth never Appear more after, is not that a sign The Goddess is displeas'd? Eum. That it a while Appears not, is to cherish, not extinguish The Passion thence conceiv'd: as Persecutions Make Piety stronger still, and bring th' Afflicted Unto the glory of renowned Martyrs. Luc. But is there then no hope but that? Alas! This man perhaps might perish in some War As now (But O ye Gods avert the Fate!) [to her self. And then th' unhappy sighing Virgin fall From that her feigned Heaven. Eum. It cannot be; Venus destroyes her Deity, if She shew And then delude: She will not lose what once Sh' hath made her own; She that knits hearts by th' Eyes, Will keep the knot fast by their Entercourse, If you have once but seen, and lov'd, permit The rest unto the Deity. Will it please Your Highness to peruse the Letter? 'tis Of moment I presume: why blush you Madam? And, while I ask you, why look pale? Luc. Eumela, The supposition's truth; lately, thou knowest, I did assist at Venus Sacrifice; He, whom I saw, and lov'd, saw, and lov'd too, And now hath writ—but let Olyndus tell him I will not see him, though he were the Soul Of all Mankind. Eum. I will. Luc. Hear me—yet if He have a true undoubted Friend, he may Send him, I'l meet him in the Myrtle Grove, And tell him more. Eum. I will obey. Luc. But stay— And yet that's all. Eum. I go. [Exit Eumela. Luc. The Soul doth give Brightness to th' Eye, and some say, That the Sun, If not enlight'ned by th' Intelligence That doth inhabit it, would shine no more Than a dull Clod of Earth: so Love, that is Brighter than Eye, or Sun, if not enlight'ned By Reason, would so much of Lustre lose As to become but gross, and foul Desire; I must refine his Passion; None can wooe Nobly, but he that hath done Nobly too. Scen. V. To her Florina and Malthora. Mal. Your Highness here alone? Luc. But so long only As gives you leave to ask. What? sad Florina? I'd thought your Soul had dwelt within it self, Been single a full presence, and that you Had set your self up your own Trophy now Full of true Joy. Flo. 'Tis hard to cast off that That we call Passion, we may veyl, and cloud it, But 'twill break out at last. True Joy is that Which now I cannot have. Luc. How so Florina? Flo. True Joy consists in Looks, and Words, and Letters, Which now an Absence, equall to Divorce, Hath wholly barr'd us of. Luc. Looks, Words, and Letters! Alas they are but only so much Air Diversly form'd, &amp; so the food of that Changeable Creature; not the Viands of True constant Lovers. Flo. But, if I see not, Is not my Joy grown less, who could not love 'Till I first saw? and if I hear not, can I have the perfect Harmony of pleasure, Who something ow to words that I first yeelded? Luc. Who ever yet was won by words? we come Conquer'd, and when we grant, we do not yeeld, But do confess that we did yeeld before. But be those Senses some Contentments, Madam, You must not yet make them the great, and true Essentiall Joy that only can consist In the bright perfect Union of two Spirits. Mal. But seeing those Spirits cannot work, but by The Organs of the Body, 'tis requir'd That (to the full perfection of this Joy) Bodies should be near-Neighbours too. Flo. I must Confess that I subscribe unto the Princess, And somwhat too to you: the Presence may Conveigh, and fill, and polish Joy; but yet To see, or hear, cannot be Joyes themselves. And where this Presence is deny'd, the Soul Makes use of higher, and more subtle means, And by the strength of thought creates a Presence Where there is none. Mal. Alas! how we doe lose Our selves in speculation of our Loves, As if they were unbody'd Essences! Luc. I would Eumela now were here; Shee'd tell us, All Is the same Joy, as Love from sight, or thought, Is the same Love; and that Love's turning to Either of them, is only but a Needle Turning to severall points, no diverse flame, But only divers degrees of the self-same. Come Madam let's away and seek her out. [Exeunt. Scene VI. Charistus, Olyndus. Cha. Not see me, say you, though I were the Soul Of all Mankind? Olyn. They were the words return'd— But if he have a true undoubted friend, Send him, I'le tell him more. Cha. Have I deserted My Country, now in danger, where I had Took Honour Captive, and for ever fixt her As an Intelligence unto my Sword, To move and guide it? have I scorn'd my Fortunes, And laid aside the Prince, have I contemn'd That much priz'd thing call'd Life, and wrestled with Both Winds and Flouds, through which I have arriv'd Hither at last, and all this not to see her? Olyn. Doth she betray, or undisguise you to The State? Doth she forbid you, Sir, to love? Affection is not wanting, where 'tis wise; She onely doth forbid you that you see her. Cha. Only forbid me to be happy, only Forbids me to enjoy my self; What could She more, were I her Enemy? Olyndus Hast thou at no time told her, that there was A Cretan call'd thee Friend? Olyn. Why do you ask? Cha. Perhaps Sh' hath found this way to send for thee. Olyn. Though I have thought it worth the boasting, that Charistus is my friend, yet by that Word, Sacred to Noble Souls, I never had So much accesse to tell her any thing, Much lesse my Friendship. Cha. Thou shalt go Olyndus. Olyn. When my eyes see her, yours do; when I talk, 'Tis you that talk; we are true friends, and one, Nay that one interchang'd; for I am you. Cha. 'Tis true thou art my friend, so much my friend, That my selfe am not more my selfe, than thou art: If thou dost go, I go—But stay—Didst not Thou say mine eyes were thine? thou didst: if that Be so, then thou must love her too, and then— Olyndus thou must stay. Olyn. She loves you so, (As my Eumela doth inform me) that No humane Image can deface the Print That you have drawn i'th' Tablet of her Soul. Cha. If that she loves me so, why then she must Love thee so too; for thou and I are one. Olyn. Why then, Sir, if you go your self, the issue Will be the same however, so, when she Loves you Shee'l love me too. Cha. We are both one. In hearts and minds Olyndus: but those Minds Are cloath'd with Bodies. Bodies that do oft— I know not what—yet thou hast an Eumela, A fair Eumela trust me—Thou must go— But use not any Language, Gesture, Looks, That may bee constru'd ought above Respect; For thou art young and Beautiful, and Valiant, And all that Ladies long for. Olyn. When I prove So treacherous to my Friend, my selfe, my faire Eumela, mark me with that hatefull brand That Ignominy hath not discover'd yet, But doth reserve to sear the foulest Monster That shall appear in Nature. Cha. I beleeve thee: Yet something bids me still not let thee go. But Ile not hearken to it; though my Soul Should tell me 'twere not fit, I'd not beleeve My Soul could think so. Olyn. How resolve you then? Cha. Do what thou wilt. I do beleeve—and yet I doe—I know not what—O my Lucasia! O my Olyndus! divers waies I bend, Divided 'twixt the Lover and the Friend. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCENE I. Olyndus to Lucasia in the Grove. Olyn. Mmay't please your Highness, Madam— I have a friend so much my self, that I Cann't say he's absent now, yet he hath sent me To be here present for him: we enterchange Bosoms, and Counsels, Thoughts and Souls so much, That he entreats you to conceive you spake To him in me; All that you shall deposite Will be in safe, and faithfull Ears; the same Trust you expect from him, shall keep your words, And the same Night conceal 'em: 'tis Charistus The noble Cretan. Luc. When you said your Friend, The rest was needless; I conceive him all That makes up Vertue, all that we call Good Whom you Olyndus give your Soul to; yet I'd rather court his Valour, than his Love, Did he shine bright in Armour, call for Dangers, Eager to cut his way through stubborn Troops, Ev'n this my softness, arm'd as he, could follow And prompt his Arm, supply him with fresh Fury, And dictate higher dangers. Then when Dust And Bloud hath smear'd him (a disguise more worthy Of Princes far, than that he wears) I could Embrace him fresh from Conquest, and conceive him As fair as ever any yet appear'd To longing Virgins in their Amorous Dreams. Olyn. Fury could never from the Den of danger Awake that horror yet, that bold Charistus Durst not attempt, stand equall with, and then Conquer, and trample, and contemn. Luc. Revenge And Hate I do confess, may sometimes carry The Soul beyond it self to do, and suffer: But the things then are Furious, not Great, And sign the Actor Headlong, but not Vertuous. Olyn. He that can do this, Madam, and Love too, Must needs be vertuous; that holy Flame Clean and untainted, as the fresh desires Of Infant Saints, enters not Souls that are Of any foul Complexion. He that Loves, Even in that he Loves, is good: and as He is no less an Atheist, that denies The Gods to be most happy, than the Man That dares Affirm there are no Gods at all; So he's no less an Heretick, that shall Deny Love to be Vertuous, than he That dares Affirm there is no Love at all. Luc. But he hath left his Country now, when that Her Wealth, her Name, her Temples, and her Altars, Her Gods, and Liberty, stand yet upon Th' uncertain Dye; when Danger cals his Arm, And Glory should arrest his Spirit there; And this to Court one, whom he knows not, whether She may think Vertue a meer Airy word, And Honour but a blast, invented to Make catching Spirits dare, and do high things. Olyn. That you are Vertuous, is a knowledge, that All must confess they have, but only those That have not Eyes: For if that Souls frame Bodies, And that the Excellence of the Architect Appear in the perfection of the Structure, Whether you have a Soul enrich'd with vertues, Must be a blind Man's doubt: Nature dares not Thrust out so much deceit into the World; 'Twould make us not beleeve her works were meant For true firm Peeces, but Delusions only. Luc. Though I must not agree t' you, to pass by What you have said, If I were Vertuous, You must confess him so far ignorant yet, As not to know whether I'd Love, or no. Oly. This Knowledge is of more Extent than th' other. For being that to be lov'd is the Effect Of your own worths, you must love all mens Loves As a Confession of your Graces, that Your selves have drawn from them. That which your Beauty Produceth, is a Birth as dear unto you, As are your Children. Luc. Should there more than one Love us (if this hold) we must love them too, And so that Sacred Tye that joyns the Soul To one, and but to one, were but a Fable, A thing in Poetry, not in the Creature. Olyn. One is your Trophy: and he Lov'd as That The Rest but Witnesses: thus Princes, when They Conquer Princes, though they only count Those Names of Glory, and Renown, their Victory, Take yet their meaner Subjects in, as fair Accesses to their Triumphs, who, although They are not the main Prize, are some what yet That doth confirm that there was worth, and force, To which the Main did justly yeeld. Luc. Be't then That I do love his Love, I am not yet Bound to accept it in what shape soever It doth appear; the Manner, Time, and Place May not be relish'd, though the thing be lik'd. Olyn. For these he doth expect your Dictates, with As much Religion, as he would the Answers Of Sacred Oracles, and with the same Vow of Performance. Luc. You must tell him then, He must go back, and there do Honorably; Succour his Country, cheer the Souldier, fight, Spend, and disburse the Prince, where e'r he goes, Get him a Name, and Title upon Cyprus. I will not see him 'till he hath Conquer'd, till He hath rid high in Triumph, and when this Is done, let him consider then, it is My Father, &amp; my Subjects, and my Kingdom That he hath Conquer'd. Olyn. I am an Agent only, And therefore must be faithful. Luc. But withall To shew that I reject him not, you may Tell him, that being he hath such a friend, Whiles he is absent I will love Olyndus Instead of him. [Exit Lucasia. Olyn. But that my Friend is in me I should have deem'd it Sacrilege, to have had A thought like that suggested. My Charistus, Were he not something carefull in his Love, (I will not call him Jealous) were beyond The Lot of Man: I must not tell him all, Some may be hid; yet how shall I unriddle The Mystery of this Answer? But the knots That Love doth tye, himself will only find The way to loose— Scen. II. To him Charistus. Olyn. —And here Charistus comes. Souls once possess'd, as his, are most impatient, They meet what they should stay for. Cha. Dear Olyndus, Pardon that I expect not, but make hast To intercept my Doom Others perhaps May wait the punctuall Minute, and observe The just and even Period: but Charistus Doth love too slow, when time, and Sun can bind him Unto a regular Motion. Olyn. Would you had Been there your self! would you had drunk in all The Looks, Words, Graces, and Divinities That I have done! I'm like the Priest that's full Of his inspiring God, and am possess'd With so much rapture, that methinks I could Bear up my self without a Wing, or Chariot, And hover o'r the Earth, still dropping something That should take root in Kingdoms, and come up The Good of people. Cha. Let me ask thee then As we do those that do come fresh from Visions, What saw'st thou there? Olyn. That which I see still, that Which will not out; I saw a Face that did Seem to participate of Flames, and Flowers; Eyes in which Light combin'd with Jet to make Whiteness be thought the Blot, and Black hereafter Purchase the Name of Innocence, and Lustre. The whole was but one solid Light, and had I Not seen our Goddess rising from the Flouds Pourtray'd less fair, less Goddess, I had thought The thing I saw, and talk'd with, must have been The Tutelar Deity of this our Island. Cha. That I should let thee go! that I should be So impious to my self, as not to break Her great Commands, and so become a Martyr By daring to be happy 'gainst her will— But on Olyndus. Olyn. You may think this The Height, the Achme, and the All of her: But when I tell you, that She hath a Mind That hides all this, and makes it not appear, Disparaging as 'twere, what ever may Be seen without her, then you'l thus exclame; Nature, thou wert o'rseen to put so mean A Frontispeece to such a Building. Cha. Give me, O quickly give me the whole Miracle, Or presently I am not. Olyn. Think, Charistus, Think out the rest, as 'tis, I cannot speak it. Cha. Alas! what should I think? Olyn. Conceive a Fire Simple and thin; to which that Light we see, And see by, is so far impure, that 'tis Only the stain, and blemish of the World; And if it could be plac'd with it in one And the same Tablet, would but only serve As bound and shadow to it: Then conceive A Substance that the Gods have set apart, And when they would put generous Motions Into a Mortall Breast, do take the Soul And couch it there, so that what e'r we call Vertue in us, is only but a Turning And Inclination toward her from whom This Pow'r was first deriv'd. Cha. What present God Lent thee his Eyes, and stood blind by, whiles thou Did'st gaze, and surfet on these Glories? Olyn. Others Do Love the shape, the Gesture, and the Man, But She the Vertue. Mark Charistus. She Saies She could Court you ring'd about with Dangers, Doat on you smear'd, and stiff with hostile Bloud, Count and exact your wounds, as a due sum You are to pay to Valour; All which when I told her was in Love, she said I did Present a spark, when she desir'd a full And glorious Constellation—to be short, She saies you must go back, do honourably, Get you a Name upon the Cyprian Forces; And bids when you have done all this, consider It is her Father, and his Subjects, and His Kingdome that you conquer— Cha. And her self That I shall lose by doing so. If I Return, and Crete be Conquer'd, then She will Count me Spoyl, and Luggage; and my Love Only a Slave's Affection. If I Conquer, And Cyprus follow my Triumphant Chariot, My Love wil then be Tyranny: and She, How can she light an Hymeneal Torch From her lov'd Countries Flame? I am rejected, Charistus is a Name of scorn. Olyn. VVhat Fates Dare throw that Name upon my Friend? To shew That she rejects you not, because there is That Trust, rhat Faith, and that Confusion of Charistus and Olyndus 'twixt us, in the mean VVhiles he is absent, tell him, saith she, that I'll love Olyndus in his stead. Cha. How! Man Th' hast dealt dishonourably. This the Light? And this the Fire that makes that Light a stain? Olyn. This I foretold my selfe: my good Charistus Let not your Anger carry you beyond The bent of Reason; can I give account Of others Passions? did I first conceive The words my self; then speak 'em? Cha. O ye Gods! Where is the Faith? where the Olyndus now? Th' hast been a Factor for thy self: I'd thought I'd sent a Friend, but he's return'd a Merchant, And will divide the Wealth. Olyn. Far be that Brand From your Olyndus! far from your Lucasia! She hath a Face hath so much Heaven in it, And this Olyndus so much Worship of it, That he must first put on another Shape, And become Monster, e'r he dare but look Upon her with a thought that's Masculine. Cha. Peace Treachery! I am too cold; my Anger Is dull and lazy yet. I'l search that Breast, And dig out falshood from the secret'st Corner In all thy Heart, here, in the very place That thou hast wrong'd me. Olyn. There is nothing here That my Charistus knows not. 'Pray you open, And search, and judge; and when you find all true, Say you destroy'd a Friend. Cha. It is your Art I see to wooe, but I will make you speak Something that is not Flattery. Olyn. Olyndus Ne'r lov'd the Man as friend yet, whom he did I ear as an Enemy. 'Tis one part of Valour That I durst now receive, conceal, and help you, Here in the Bosome of that State, which hath Cast out a spear into the Cretan Field, And bid you War. Cha. Thou hast already here Betray'd my Love; thy falshood will proceed Unto my Person next. I'd thought I'd been Clasp'd in Embraces, but I find I am Entangled in a Net. Olyn. Y'are safe as in The Bosome of your Father, take this Veyl Of Passion from your Eyes; and you'l behold The same Olyndus still. Cha. The same Deceiver, The same false perjur'd Man. Draw, or by Heaven, That now should Thunder and revenge my wrongs, Thou shalt dye sluggishly. Olyn. Recall your self, And do but hear— Cha. What words a Coward will Fawn on me with, to keep an abject life, Not worth the saving. Olyn. Witness all ye Gods That govern Friendship, how unwillingly I do unty the Knot. Cha. Draw quickly, lest It may be known I am the Cretan Prince, And so my juster Fury be not suffer'd To scourge a timorous and perfidious Man. Oly. Though thou stand'st here an Enemy, and we have The Pledge of all the Cretan State, yet know Though all our Island's People did look on, And thou proclaim'st thy self to be the Man, They should not dare to know the Prince, untill I'd done this Sacrifice to Honour. Cha. So! They fight, and wound each other dangerously, and then retire, Charistus to Lucasia's Myrtle, and Olyndus to the next adjoyning, and leaning there speak. Olyn. I have not long to stay 'mongst Mortals now, And then you may search all those Corners that You talk'd of in my Heart. But if you find Ought that is falshood towards you, or more Than reverence to Lucasia, may I want The Honour of a Grave—Hear O ye Gods, (Ye Gods whom (but a while) and I am with) Lucasia is as spotless, as the Seat That you prepare for Virgin Lovers! Cha. I Have wrong'd thee, my Olyndus, wrong'd thee much, But do not chide me; there's not life enough Left in me to make use of Admonition. Olyn. If you survive, love your Lucasia; 'twill Make your Olyndus happy; for the good Of the surviving Friend, some holy men Say, doth pertain unto the Friend Departed. Cha. Vertuous Lucasia! and hadst thou Olyndus Not been so too; my Gods had fought for me; But I must dye—Olyndus. [Charistus faints. Olyn. Heaven forbid That my Charistus perish! I have only Strength left to wish: If I can creep yet to thee I'l help thee all I can. [Olynd. sinks Cha. And I will meet thee; [They creep one to the other and so embrace.] Let us embrace each other yet. The Fates Preserve our Friendship, and would have us equall, Equall ev'n in our Angers: we shall go Down equall to the Shades both, two waies equall, As Dead, as Friends. And when Lucasia shall Come down unto us (which the Heavens forbid Should be as yet) I'l not be Jealous there. Scen. III. To them as they lye groveling, and embracing thus, Machessa and Philænis. Phi. O me! Good Heavens! had you the Balsam, Lady, Now that you told me of, 'twould do some good. Mach. This is Olyndus, that the honour'd Stranger; Brave Spirits are a Balsam to themselves: There is a Nobleness of Mind, that heals Wounds beyond Salves—look not, but help Philænis, Gather the Weapons, and the rest up quickly; Where two are wrong'd, I ought to succour both. Machessa carries 'em out. Scen. IV. Lucasia, Florina, Malthora, Eumela. Lu. Madam, ne'r fear your Dream, for that is only The reliques of your day-time thoughts, that are Preserv'd by'our Soul, to make a Scene i'th'Night. Eum. Have you not dream'd the like before? Mal. Yes thrice. Eum. Why then Pæstanus now hath perish'd thrice, Or else y' have sometimes dream'd in vain. Flor. Eumela, I told her this, and that her troubled Sleeps Were one Love still waking. Luc. Wee'l divert This anxious fear. Reach me the Lute Eumela. Have you not heard how Venus did complain For her belov'd Adonis? The young Poet, That was desir'd to give a Language to Th'afflicted Goddess, thought her words were these. The Ode. Cal. VVake my Adonis, do not dye; One Life's enough for thee and I. Where are thy words? thy wiles? Thy Loves, thy Frowns, thy smiles? Alas in vain I call; One death hath snatch'd 'em all: Yet Death's not deadly in that Face, Death in those Looks it self hath Grace. 'Twas this, 'twas this I feard When thy pale Ghost appear'd; This I presag'd when thund'ring Jove Tore the best Myrtle in my Grove; When my sick Rose-buds lost their smell, And from my Temples untouch'd fell, And 'twas for some such thing My Dove did hang her Wing. Whither art thou my Deity gone? Venus in Venus there is none. In vain a Goddess now am I Only to Grieve, and not to dye. But I will love my Grief, Make Tears my Tears relief; And Sorrow shall to me A new Adonis be. And this no Fates can rob me of, whiles I A Goddess am to Grieve, and not to Dye. Flor. Madam, they say 'twas in this very Grove The Goddess thus complain'd. Scen. V. To them Philænis with a couple of Napkins. Eum. How now Philænis? Are you turn'd Sewer to the Lady-Errant? Phi. Lady I'm sent to wipe away the Bloud From these two Myrtles. Eum. Bless me! what Bloud Philænis? Luc. I hope the Song will not prove ominous. Phi. 'Tis fit we have some Wars at home too, else My Lady would have no employment left. Luc. What Wars? whose Bloud? Phi. A pair of froward Lovers, Olyndus, and the Stranger, fought, it seems, Here till they almost kill'd themselves: and when Neither did fear, but both did faint, it seems Olyndus lean'd there, and the Stranger there, And with their Blouds besmear'd the Trees a little; We did not think your Highness should have seen it. They rise amaz'd, the Princess repairs to the Tree where Charistus bled, and Eumela to the Tree where her Olyndus bled. Luc. Is this Olyndus way of mingling Souls? Eum. Is this the Others Enterchange of Breasts? Luc. O Heavens! durst your Olyndus thus? Eum. O Heav'ns, And O ye Gods too! durst that other this? Luc. Did he then stay behind for this Eumela? Eum. And did he leave his Country to destroy One worth it all, here in our very Bosoms? Luc. H' has ruin'd one, whose like if Nature will Shew to the World again, she must lay up, And gather, till she hath store enough of Graces To throw into the World. Eum. Olyndus stood As high, and brave as he, his Enemy had But this advantage of him, that he was A Cretan, as by Birth, so too in Faith. Luc. Were he the Birth of some unshelter'd Cottage, He were yet fairer in the Eye o'th' World Than e'r Olyndus could have been, in that He was a Princess's thoughts; 'twas I that lov'd him. Eum. Although the Name of Princess be upon you, And signs you Dread, and Soveraign, yet I must Tell you that Love's a Princess too in me, And stamps as much Heroick Majesty Upon my Thoughts, as Birth hath done on yours. Luc. Though, as a Princess, I could make thy Love And thee forgotten Names, yet I depose My self, and am thy Equall. Eum. 'Tis no need That you descend, Love carries up Eumela To be as high as is her Princess, and In this sad Fate placeth her equall with Her Dread Lucasia. Luc. Hear, hear this brave man! And if thou liv'st revenge it on Olyndus. Eum. And thou the Spirit of my dear Olyndus, Be thou still worthy, still thy self. Speak thou O Nature, was there not the same clay knead To make our Hearts? did not the same Fire kindle Our Souls? and thou, O Love, was't not the same Metall that wounded both? you must not count The Princess into th' worth of your Affection; Love when he ballanceth the Hearts that come Under his Power, casts not in their Births, Fortunes, and Titles. Luc. Would some powerfull God Would change our Persons, and make thee Lucasia, And me Eumela, that I might avow The justice of my Love in spight of State. Mal. Forbear Eumela. Flor. 'Tis the Princess speaks. Eum. Nor Prince, nor Subject speaks, but Love in both. Scen. VI. They leave their Trees, and repair to Machessa. To them Machessa. Flo. Here's one can tell you all. Luc. Say, good Machessa, How doth the Stranger? Eum. Lives Olyndus yet? Mac. Both live, but wounded much, yet hopes of both; For they are Friends, and as their Minds have clos'd, Their wounds may shortly too. Luc. How fell they out? Mach. I heard the Stranger, Madam, thus confess, As our Olyndus did embrace him; Thou Wert honourable, my Olyndus, ever; But I was foul, and Jealous: then Olyndus Fell on his Neck, told him 'twas only heat, And strength of Love; and vow'd he'd never tell The cause and ground o'th' Quarrell: but the Stranger Swore by his Gods, and Altars, that he would Go find, and tell, and ask the Deity Forgiveness first, then him—I heard no more But only sighs from either. Luc. 'Twas too much— That I should throw away my grief for one That durst have such a thought! Charistus, you And I are both deceiv'd in one another; [aside. And, poor Olyndus, deerly hast thou paid For both our Errors— —Machessa, as you love me Be carefull of Olyndus, for the other— My care hath been more than he's worth already— [aside. Flo. Eumela, The Princess is much troubled, pray heav'n your freedom Did not offend her Highness. Eum. I hope it did not: Madam, if too much Love made me forge, And pass the bounds of Duty, humbly, I beg Your Graces pardon, beseeching you t' impute My folly to my Passion. Luc. Call't not Passion, 'Twas Reason to Contest: Love's Kingdom is Founded upon a Parity; Lord, and Subject, Master, and Servant, are Names banish'd thence; They wear one Fetter all, or, all one Freedom. Eum. There was some Spirit spake within me, 'twas— Luc. Alas! excuse it not: all that do Love, In that they love, are equall, and above none, None, but those only whom the God denies The honour of his Wound—Eumela, hear me, Whispers her. Charistus is grown foul, and thy Olyndus Is now my Martyr, for my sake he bleeds, And I, for this, will make Charistus know, That he, who doubts his Friend, is his own Foe. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Adraste, Lucasia, Malthora, Florina, Eumela, Cosmeta, Pandena, Rhodia, Machessa, sate as at Parliament. Adr. My Lady Martiall, and the rest Mercuriall, Woman's the Gem of Heaven, in which Nature Hath carv'd the Universe in less Characters; A Peece of such Invention, and such Art, That, where as in one common lazy Mold Made for dispatch, she casts, and thrusts out Men, As some things done in haste, she may be said To build, and send forth us; yet (howsoeve It comes about) in all foretimes and Ages Councels and Senats have excluded us, Thinking us like those finer Wits, which spin Themselves into such subt'le Fancies, that They are too Curious to be employ'd, Being as far from Service, as from Grossness: But this hath been from Errour, not from Tryall: Grant me their Composition stronger, grant me Their Bodie's ruder, and more fit for Wars, Which some yet here do happily contradict, I cannot yet conceive, why this should bind us To be their Slaves; our Souls are Male, as theirs. That we have hitherto forborn t' assume And manage Thrones, that hitherto we have not Challeng'd a Soverainty in Arts, and Arms, And writ our selves Imperiall, hath been Mens Tyranny, and our Modesty. Being then Nature did mean us Soveraigns, but cross Fate (Envious of her, willing that nothing should Be perfect upon Earth) still kept us under; Let us, i'th'name of Honour, rise unto The pitch of our Creation. Now's the time; The best and ablest men are absent, those That are left here behind are either Fooles, Or Wise men overgrown, which is all one. Assert your selves into your Liberty then, Stand firm, and high, put these good Resolutions Forth into Action: then, in spight of Fate, A Female Hand shall turn the Wheel of State. Om. Inspir'd Adraste! Om. Most divine Adraste! Adr. If that you relish this let Mistris Speaker On to the rest. Om. On, on, on, on, on, on! Eum. Most Willing, most Agreeing, most Potent, And most free Ladies, &amp;c.— 'Tis fit all things should be reduc'd unto Their Primeve Institution, and first Head; Woman was then as much as Man, those Stones Which Pyrrha cast, made as fair Creatures as Deucalion's did: that his should be set up Carv'd, and Ador'd, but hers kept down, and trampled, Came from an ancient Injury; what Oracle, and What voice from Heaven commanded that? Cos. Most true! Observe that Ladies. Pan. Sibyl's Leaf by Juno! Eum. He that saies Woman is not fit for Policy, Doth give the Lie to Art; for what man hath More sorts of Looks? more Faces? who puts on More severall Colours? Men, compar'd in this, Are only Dough bak'd Women; not as once Maliciously one call'd us Dough-bak'd Men. Cos. 'Tis no single Voice; the whole Sex speaks in her. Eum. Some few yet Do speak against our Passions, but with greater; Rail at our Lightness, but 'tis out of Humour; Rather Disease than Reason; they being such As wipe off what they spit. For Heav'n forbid That any should vouchsafe to speak against us But rough Philosophers, and rude Divines, And such like dull Professions. But wee'l now Shew them our Passions are our Reasons Edge, And that, which they call Lightness, only is An Art to turn our selves to severall Points. Time, Place, Minds, People, all things now concur To re-estate us there where Nature plac'd us: Not a Male more must enter Cyprus now. Cos. No, nor an Eunuch, nothing that hath been Male heretofore. Pan. No, nor Hermophrodite; Nothing that is half Male. A little Spark Hath often kindled a whole Town; we must Be cautelous in the least. Eum. That then they may not Regain the Island, all the Havens must Be stor'd, and guarded. Cos. Very fit they should. Eum. Next to the Havens, Castles out of hand Must be repair'd, Bulwarks, and Forts, and Sconces Be forthwith rear'd. Cos. 'Tis time we were about them. Eum. Arms then must be bought up, and Forces rais'd; Much, much is to be done— Pan. Why let Machessa About it straight. Eum. I see agreeing Minds, Your Hearts and Courage very ready, but Where is the Nerve and Sinew of this Action? Where shall we have the Mony to do this? Cos. Wee'l give our hair for Cordage, and our finest Linnen for Sails, rather than this Design Shall be once dash'd for want. Pan. There's much already Come in— Cos. And more doth dayly. Pan. Hearts and Purses Concur unto the Action. Cos. We have Notes Of the particular Contributions. Eum. Her Majesty would have you read 'em, that She may know what to trust to. Cos. From the Temple [She reads. We do expect ten dozen of Chalices, But they are hid, or else already gone— Eum. This is not what you have, but what y'have not. Cos. We tell you this, that you mayn't take it ill, That we ha'n't borrow'd some o'th' Holy Plate. Well then, to what we have—First from the Court Ten Vessels of Corinthian Brass, with divers Peeces of Polyclet, and Phydias, Parrhasius, Zeuxes, and Protogenes, Apelles, and such like great Master-hands. Eum. Statues, and Pictures do but little good Against the Enemy. Cos. Pray y' hear it out: Rich Cabinets then, which, though they do contain Treasure immense and large, have nothing yet Within them richer than themselves. Eum. What hold they? Cos. Pearls, Rubies, Emralds, Amethysts, and Saphirs, Crysolits, Jaspers, Diamonds, two whereof Do double the twelfth Caract: besides Sparks Enough to stick the Roof o'th' Banquetting House, And make it seem an Heav'n. Eum. VVell, on Cosmeta. Cos. Twelve standing Goblets, two more rich and massy, The one bears Bacchus sitting on a Vine, Squeezing out Purple liquor, Th' other hath Silenus riding on his patient Beast, And Satyrs dancing after him. More yet, Twelve other less engraven with less Stories, As Loves, and Months, and Quarters of the year, Nymphs, Shepheards, and such like—This from the Court. Eum. VVhat from the City? Pan. Purple Robes, and Furs [Pan. reads. In great abundance—Basons and large Ewers, Flagons, and Dishes, Plates, and Voyders, all Rich and unwieldy. And besides all this, Gold Chains, and Candle-Cups innumerable. Eum. The Contribution's much— Pan. But yet not ended— Twelve City Ladies send us word, they have Twelve Iron Chests, and rib'd with Iron too, VVherein they do suspect there lies a Mine, That hath not seen the Sun for six Olympiads. Eum. Let 'em be got in suddenly; we must Be hot and eager in our undertakings. The VVealth's enough; the East was overrun By the bold Macedonian Boy with less. VVas't not Machessa? But I pray you nothing From the poor Country Villagers? Pan. Very little; Hoop-rings, and Childrens VVhistles, and some forty Or fifty dozen of gilt-Spoons, that's all. Eum. Let it be hastily deliver'd all Into her Majesties Treasury. Cos. Under favour, We think Machessa would be very fit Both to take in, and to disburse. Eum. It is not For any private Interest that She asks it, But for the Publike good. Pan. Perhaps. But yet The People will think better, if it be Entrusted in a Subject's hand, and Hers Especially who never had a Husband— Cos. No, nor a Child as yet. Adr. Why be it so; You shall dispose't Machessa. Mach. I consider The trust you give me; see the weight, and Nature, The Price and Moment of the Cause; Know next My Order binds me not to be endow'd With any Wealth or Utensill, besides My Steed, my Habit, Arms, and Page; To which When I prove false, let him that weaves my Story (Whether he be a Courtier, or perhaps A Scholar that writes worse) bring me no higher Than to scratch'd Faces, and such Suburb brangles. Truth is the Essence of our Order, we Who are Errants cannot deceive and Be. Adr. Let us away: though the Male-Gods may frown, The Female part of Heaven is sure our own [She whis. Eu. Eum. Noble Machessa all your deeds I see Ex. Adrast. Cal. &amp;c. Manent Eu. Machessa. Tend to the Scope of Honour. Mach. Were she seated Upon the top of some high craggy Rock, Whose Head were in the Country of the Thunder, Guarded with watchfull Dragons, I will climb, And ravish her from thence, to have my Name Turn'd o'r from Age to Age, as something that Ought to outlive the Phænix, and dye only With Men and Time. Eum. Though you Court Danger thus, I hope you will not scorn bright Glory, if She come an easier way. Mach. I look to her, Not to her Cloaths, and Habit. Eum. Will you be Famous in History then? fill swelling Volumes With your sole Name? be read aloud, and high I'th' Cyprian Annals? and live fresh upon The Tongue of Fame for ever? will you stand High on your Steed in Brass, and be at once The stop of Strangers, and the Natives Worship, By one fair Peacefull Action? Mach. Brave Eumela, To say I'l do't is lazy; it is done. Eum. 'Tis the Queen's sute besides, And She shall thank you. Mach. Honour is my Queen, And my Deeds thank themselves. But say, Eumela, Quickly, what is't? Eum. Why only send this Wealth, That's put into your hands, unto the Army, And so defeat this folly that they here So eagerly pursue. Mach. By Heav'n I'll first Scatter the Ashes of my Ancesters, Burn and demolish Temples, or pull down The Statue of our Goddess, whiles her self Stood with the proudest thunder to defend it; You ought to thank me, that you have propos'd it, And yet still live. Eum. But pray you reason it. Mach. Follies of idle Creatures! who e'r heard Of Ladies Errant yet that stood to Reason? But you that brag of Books, and Reading, and I know not what unnecessary Learning, Tell me, did brawny Hercules, who wand'red I'th' Lion's skin, and Club, or well-set Theseus That trod his steps, e'r do the like? Eum. No. VVomen Ne'r came to such a pitch of danger yet As to be banish'd all: then who e'r trusted Theseus, or Hercules with ten Drachmas? who Could know their Minds that way? This single deed VVill make Machessa go beyond his Pillars, And th' other's Fame. They quell'd but single Robbers, You will defeat thousands of Rebels. They Help'd some poor Village, or some Town perhaps, You will redeem a Nation. Mach. Thou say'st something; But I shall break my faith Eum. To whom? to those That have before broke theirs unto their Prince? Mach. They'l curse me too. Eum. As bold Machessa hunts not The Praise of People, so she can contemn Their Curse, when she doth well. Consider too Nations will curse you more if you assist 'em. Mach. But 'tis against my Order to deceive. Eum. 'Tis more against your Order to assist Rebellious Persons 'gainst their King. Besides, Doth not your Oath enjoyn you to relieve Distressed men? who more distressed now Than is the King, and th' Army? fear not words; You are not Treacherous unto them, but faithfull Unto your self. Why stands this Helmet here? VVhy do you wear this Fauchion? to what use Carry this Javelin? Mach. Not to help women; no, Men are my Oath. All shall be sent Eumela, The King must have it: wee'l be famous— Eum. But You must be secret 'till it all come in. Mach. And you'l assist me in the sending of't? Eum. Take you no care for that, 'tis done. Mach. But will The Queen not take it ill? Eum. 'Tis her great fear, You'l scarce be brought to yeeld it up. Away, Go, and delude 'em on, y'are safe, and may Deceive in Conscience now. Mach. Bellona bless thee! [Exit Machessa. Eum. But how shall we now conveigh it to 'em? Scen. II. To her Philondas and Pæstanus as having stoln from the Army. [Eum.] —Heav'n's of the Plot! No fitter men. Jove bless me! My Lord Philondas, and my Lord Pæstanus! This your appearance to me's like the first Appearance to a new admitted Priest, And I am quite as doubtfull now as he, Not knowing whether 't be my fancy, or The God, that makes the Vision. Phil. Dear Eumela, Thou know'st we do appear to Ladies still In very flesh and bloud. Though we may talk Of spirituall Love, my Lord, and I, you know, Could ne'r creep in at Key-holes yet; I'm sure We pay for th' opening of the doors, Eumela. Eum. My Lord you make Pæstanus blush. Pæst. I hope I am not so ill bred Eumela. Eum. Troth The Camp hath spoyl'd you both. The Cretan Ladies They say are far beyond our Cyprus Dames. Phi. Yes to cleave Logs, and carry Burthens. Eum. But I mean for Beauty. Phil. In whose Eyes, Eumela? In the Town-Buls? Eum. They say the Gods have chang'd Shapes, to come down, and visit 'em. Pæst. 'Twas that They might be like 'em then. Phi. For Jove could never Be a fit Husband for 'em, till he had Got horns, and hoofs. Eum. Saw you no Children there? Pæst. What then Eumela? ha'n't you read of Creatures That have Conceiv'd by th' Air?— Phi. Don't think of any Such thing as man? The Wind and Sun Eumela, Get all the Children there; that makes 'em bluster, And rage so furiously when they are old. Pæst. Come, we lose time; where is Malthora prethee? Phi. Answer him not; by Venus, these young Husbands Are as impatient as a hungry Courtier, Or a rich Heir come newly to his Means; Do you hear me ask for Florina yet? Eum. 'Tis not in fashion, Sir, to love your Lady— Phi. At least you ought not to profess it. Pæst. I Dare swear, though none professeth less, yet none Loves more than you my Lord. Phi. 'Tis i'th' dark then; Day-light and Love are two things. But, Eumela, What do they do for Men now we are absent? Do they take Physick, or else Pray? Eum. My Lord, Their Griefs are in your places. Phi. Have their sighs Got Limbs, and Bodies? Can their sadness give 'em Comfort at Midnight? Eum. They possess it with A kind of sweetness, are so tender of it, That should they part with it, they'd think they had A second loss. Pæst. How can they pass away Their time with that? Eum. Why 'tis as necessary To them as Friend, or Confident: Pæst. But tell me How does Malthora bear it? Eum. Sir, she finds That solitude in her self, that others do Look for in Desarts. Pæst. Come my Lord, let's go And help 'em to sigh for us. Eum. They're to come Hither my Lord: pray stand behind these hangings Till I discover the whole Scene; In quickly. Here, here they come. Ex. Pæst. and Phi. Scen. III. To Her Florina, Malthora. Mal. Bless me Eumela! I Must get me Mens apparell, and go see How all things stand abroad; I did but close Mine Eyes, and presently me thought the Ghost Of my Pæstanus did appear before me, Wounded, and bloudy, and as soon as I Went to embrace him, vanish'd into air. Eum. You are so fearfull, Madam, and do fancy Danger and death so strongly, that if he Were at this instant present here before you You'd not beleeve your Eyes. Madam Florina What's that you look on so? Flor. It is, Eumela, The Picture of my Lov'd Philondas, as He had his Armour on, (and O the Heav'ns That he should ever be in such a Habit) But Fates would have it so; 'twas young Protogenes Took it before he went. Me thinks it sometimes Doth move, and alter Colour, and endeavour To get loose, and come out. Eum. Have you the Picture Of your Lord Madam too? Mal. Yes here, Eumela, Drawn by the same hand: is't not very like him? Eum. Methinks they're neither true: I've both their Statues, Though not in Armour, and as I remember They don't agree with them. Flor. Pray y' let's examine To pass the time a while. Eum. I've newly put 'em Both into Habits, and me thinks they look So fresh, and lively, that I might mistake 'em, But that I know they're absent; look you here. Does not this look more like Philondas far, She draws the hangings and shews 'em. And this more like Pæstanus than the Tablets? You must not come too near: I'l leave y' a while To view, and judge. [Exit Eumela. Flor. Good Heav'ns! my Lord Philondas! Mal. My dear Pæstanus! Phil. I am come you see A prety jant here to fulfil the longing Of a young Novice-Husband. Pæst. The first day That Hymen joyn'd us, brought not truer joy Unto my Soul than this. Scen. IV. To them Eumela. Eum. My Lords, the Queen Is come to make a visit to your Ladies: What will you do? Phil. Go and conduct her in. [Ex. Phil. Pæst. Eum. Now Madam? does your Husband vanish, when You offer to embrace him? Mal. O Eumela He's gone already. This his short appearance Is only as th' appearance of a Star To one that's perishing in a Tempest. Flor. 'Tis Only to let us die with some more Comfort. Were they to stay Eumela— Eum. This disjoyning Of Bodies, only is to knit your hearts; You'l form their Pictures in your Thoughts perhaps, And once or twice more look behind the Hangings. Mal. Peace good Eumela! here's the Queen. Scen. V. To them Adraste, Philondas, Pæstanus. Adr. Charistus, Heir to the Cretan Kingdom lost say you? Phi. Yes, and suspected to lye hid in Cyprus. Adr. And this is that doth stop the War? Pæst. This, and Th' Equality of Forces. Adr. Do our men Awake, and rouze themselves? Phi. Rich noble Spirits, And Minds that have kept Altars burning still, To Glory break out dayly, shewing how Peace and Religion did not sink, but calm 'em: This blast will swell 'em big, and high, and make 'em Ride Conquerours o'r the Flouds. Adr. They do not sleep then? Phi. No, nor watch lazily; the World will see, He, whose blest goodness hath kept War from us, Hath not took Courage from us too; When his Sad study'd Councels did remove the danger, They did not then remove the Mind. The Arm Of this days Cyprus, if provok'd, will strike As deep as Cyprus six Olympiads backwards, And the unquiet Cretan shall appear But as he did of old, our Exercise, More than our Foe: a people that we suffer To breath, and be, to keep our selves in breath. Adr. What doth the King? Pæst. More than the meanest Souldier, Yet still comes fresh from Actions: his Commands Are great, but his Examples greater still. Phi. With his uncover'd head he dares the Thunder, Slights hail and snow, and wearies out a Tempest, Then after all he shakes himself, and gives Rain, as the Heavens did before, but with A more serene Aspect. He doth exact Labour, and hardness, hunger, heat, and cold, And dust, as his Prerogatives, and counts them Only his serious Pleasures; Others Wars Are not so manly as his Exercises, And pitch'd Fields often are more easie service Than his meer Preparations. Adr. 'Tis enough; Y' have spoke a Composition, so made up Of Prince and Souldier, that th' admiring World May imitate, not equall. Come, my Lords, I have a business to employ you back with. Exeunt. Scen. VI. Lucasia, Eumela, Charistus, Olyndus. Luc. I must confess, had not this Action been Tainted with private Interest, but born From zeal unto the Publique, then it might Have been read Valour, as it is, it will Be stil'd but Fury. Eum. Madam it had then Been only Valour, now 'tis Love and Valour. Luc. VVhere those Religious Names, King, Country, Father, Are trampled over, can you call it Valour? Cha. If trampled o'r for you. To hazard all These holy Names, of Subject unto King, Of Prince to Country, and of Son to Father, And whil'st I spar'd to shed the smallest drop Of Bloud, that might be once call'd yours, to have That ignominious Name of Coward hurl'd on me, And take up all their Places; what else is it But to esteem your self a Prize, that doth Absolve me from all these, and make me stand Above the rate of mortals. Olyn. Father, Country, State, Fortunes, Commonwealth, th'are Names that Love Is not concern'd in; that looks higher still, And oversees all these. Luc. It is not Love then; For that, as it is Valiant, so it is Just, Temperate, Prudent, summons all those Noble Heroick Habits into one rich Mass, And stamps them Honour. Eum. But that Honour is A Valour beyond that of Mortals, striving Who shall possess most of this Mole-hill Earth. Olyn. That Honour is a Justice, that doth see Measures, and Weights, Axes, and Rods below it. Eu. A Temperance not concern'd in Meats, and Wines. Olyn. A Prudence that doth write Charistus now A better Patriot, than the sober'st Statesman That plots the good of Crete. Luc. If he that cares not For things, be thence above them; if he sees More nobly, that doth draw the Veyl before His Eyes to Lower Objects, then Charistus Soares high, and nothing scapes him. Cha. Fair Lucasia, I am not so immodest, as to challenge The least of these my self: but yet in that I love your Vertues, they are all mine own. Luc. And yet you fear'd I was anothers, whom I durst not publiquely avow. Do y' think My Love could stoop to such Contrivances? Or if I meant a subject of such worth, I needed to pretend a Prince? Olyn. It is not Lucasia's Love, that dares not call the Eye Of Day to try it: But where Love's engag'd To such a Treasure as your self, what can Be thought secure? It stands and watches still, And fears it's very helps; could any love Lucasia and be careless, 'twere a fault Would make him not deserve her. Luc. Could you then Think I could be so impious unto Love As to divide Eumela and Olyndus? Or else so treacherous unto Friendship, as To part Eumela and my self? Being Hearts Are Temples, and both sorts of Love most Sacred, To have wrong'd either had been Sacrilege Worthy the horrid'st Thunder. Eum. Love drinks in All that may feed suspicion, but is deaf To what may clear it; 'tis engag'd so much To th' Object, that it views the Object only, And weighs not what attends it. Luc. Where the Heart Offends, you blame the Passion. Love it self Is never undiscreet, but he that Loves. Cha. Wisdome and Love at once were never yet Permitted to a God, I must not then Presume they meet in me. If Love admits Discretion, if it Ponder, and Consider, Search, and Compare, and Judge, and then Resolve, 'Tis Policy, not Affection: give it Eyes, Counsell, and Order, and it ceaseth. What Though it first brake from out the Chaos? 'twas To make another in the Creature. Distance, Figure, and Lineament are things that come From something more Advis'd; Love never leads, It still transports. The Motions which it feels Are Fury, Rapture, Extasie, and such As thrust it out full of Instinct, and Deity, To meet what it desires. Luc. Alas! it self Hath Eyes, but 'tis our Blindness that doth veyl them: If Love could not consist with Wisdome, then The World were govern'd by one generall Madness. Olynd. 'Tis not deni'd but that we may have Wisdom Before we Love, as men may have good Eyes Before they fix them on the Sun: but dwell they A while upon it, and they straight grow blind From those admired Beauties. Luc. But if Love Do not consider, why then doth it fear? Why doth it form Chimæras to it self, And set up Thought 'gainst Thought? why is't alike Tortur'd with Truth, and Falshood? why afflicted As much from Doubts, as Certainties? Cha. This is Not from Distrust, but Care; Love is not perfect Till it begins to fear. It doth not know The worth of that it seeks, unless it be Anxious, and troubled for it: And this is Not any thought of Blemish in the thing It loves, but only Study to preserve it. Lu. Who puts a Snake 'mongst Flowers to preserve 'em? Or who pours Poyson into Crystall that It may be kept from cracking? Jealousie What art thou? thou could'st not come down from Heav'n; For no such Monsters can inhabit there. Eum. Nor can it spring from Hell; for it is born Of Love, and there is nought but Hate. Luc. Pray y' tell me Who joyn'd it unto Love? who made them swear So firm a Friendship? Olyn. The same Deity That joyn'd the Sun and Light, the same that knits The Life and Spirit. Luc. These preserve each other: But that doth twine and wreath it self about Our growing Loves, as Ivy 'bout the Oak; We think it shelters, when (alas!) we find It weakens, and destroys. Eum. It is not Jealousie That ruins Love, but we our selves, who will not Suffer that fear to strengthen it; Give way And let it work, 'twill fix the Love it springs from In a staid Center. Luc. What it works I know not, But it must needs suppose Defect in one, Either Defect of Merit in the Lover, Or in the Lov'd, of Faith; you cannot think That I give Others Favours, when your self Boast such a store of Merits. Cha. O Lucasia, Rather than be so impious as to think That you want Faith, I must confess a want Of Merit in my self; (which would there were not.) And being it is so, I was compell'd To fear lest one more worthy than my self Might throw me from my happiness. Consider That you are born t' enrich the Earth, and then If you will have one Love and not be Jealous, You must convert your Eye upon your Eye, Make your own Heart Court your own Heart, and be Your self a servant to your self. Luc. But doth not This Passion cease at last? Olyn. It ceaseth to Disturb, but still remains to quicken Love; As Thunder ceaseth when 't hath purg'd the Air, And yet the Fire which caus'd it still remains To make it move the livelier. Luc. Were it quiet, What Hand, Charistus, would More sweetly move The Orbs of this our Island? who fetch in More frequent Conquests? and who more become The Triumphs than your self? Cha. Beleeve Charistus Dreams; Errours, false Opinions, slippery Hopes, And Jealous Fears are now his Spoyl, his Captives, And follow Love's Triumphant Chariot, which His Soul sits high in, and o'rlooks the vain Things of this lower World. Luc. Lucasia did Only retire, not flie; Let's to the Grove, And by the Consummation of our Loves Under those Myrtles (which as yet perhaps Preserve the blushing Marks of those your Angers) Appease th' offended Goddess. Olyn. This your Union Will make your Kingdoms joyn; Cyprus and Crete Will meet in your Embraces. Eum. Our Hearts are Love's ord'nary Employment: 'tis a Dart Of a more scattering Metall that strikes you; When he wounds Princes, he wounds Nations too. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Pandena, Cosmeta, Rhodia, meeting Machessa and Philænis. Cos. Lady Machessa, opportunely met. Pan. What store of Arms prepar'd? Mach. The Country's layd; Spits, Andirons, Racks, and such like Utensils Are in the very Act of Metamophosis; Art is now sitting on them, and they will Be hatch'd to Engins shortly. Pan. Pray y' how doth The Muster-Roule encrease? Mach. As fast as Chloe Can take their Names; we shall be all great Women. Phil. Pray y' what Reward shall you and I have Lady? Mach. Why I will be the Queen o'th' Amazons, And thou o'th' Pigmies. Phil. I, but who shall place us In the Amazonian, and Pigmean Throne? Mach. Who but our Swords Philænis? when we have Setled the Government here at home, we will Lead out an Army 'gainst those Warlike Dames, And make 'em all our Vassals. Phil. These left handed Ladies are notable Politicians. The King of Monomotapa you may Be sure will be your Enemy, or else The Book deceives me. But the Agags they Will sure be for you. Cas. Who may the Agags be? Phi. Why a black ugly People, that do turn The inside of their Eye-lids outward, that They may look lovely; if they catch the Amazons, They sowce 'em straight, as we do Pig, by quarters, Or else do pickle 'em up for Winter Sallads. Mac. How did you come by all this Knowledge Phil.? You are a learned Page. Phil. Lady, do y' think I never read to th' Women in the Nurs'ry? But will you lose one of your Breasts? 'tis pitty That your left Pap should be burnt off. Mach. Why Gyrl? What use will there be of it? Phi. To give suck. You must go seek out some brave Alexander, And beg some half a dozen of Children of him, Or else you'l be no true bred Amazon. Pan. Must they have Macedonian Fathers then? Phil. I think the Amazonian Queen doth swear To no such Article when She is Crown'd; But ord'narily they do so; yet howe'r Your Grace may send for the three Courtiers, That you deliver'd from these Ladies here, They would be glad to be employ'd in any Such State-affairs. But I'd almost forgot The Pigmies Conquest. Pho. Have you read of them too? Phil. Though some say that their Souls are only stopt Into their Bodies, just as so much Quick-silver Is put into hot Loves, to make 'em dance As long as th' heat continues; yet, beleeve it, They are a subt'le Nation, a most shrew'd Advising People. Cos. How'l you then subdue them? Phil. By Policy, set Hays, and Traps, and Springs, And Pitfals for 'em. And if any do Dwell in the Rocks, make holes upon the top As deep as Cups, and fill 'em up with Wine; You shall have one come presently, and sip, And when he finds the sweetness, cry Chin, Chin: Then all the rest good Fellows straight come out, And tipple with him till they fall asleep; Then we may come and pack 'em up in Hampers, Or else in Hand-baskets, and carry 'em whither We please our selves. Mach. A notable Stratagem! You'l never leave your Policies Phil. Phi. But yet We must draw out some Souldiers howe'r. Cos. There's no great need of Souldiers; Their Camp's No larger than a Ginger-bread Office. Pan. And the Men little bigger. Phil. What half Heretick Book tels you that? Rho. The greatest sort they say Are like stone-pots with Beards that do reach down Unto their knees. Cos. They're carri'd to the Wars then As Chickens are to Market, all in Dorsers, Some thirty Couple on a Horse. Phil. You read Only Apocryphall History. Beleeve me They march most formally: I know't there will Be work enough for Souldiers. Mach. Wee'l train up All the young Wenches of the City here On purpose for this Expedition, And't shall be call'd the Female War. Phil. I fear They won't be strong enough to go against 'em; They have an Enemy doth vex 'em more Than Horse or Man can. Mach. Who, the Cranes you mean? I'l beg a Patent of Her Majesty To take up all that fly about the Country, For the Pigmean Service Phil. I, but who Shall's have to Discipline 'em so, that we May sly 'em at them off our fists? Mach. They fly In a most war-like Figure naturally: However we may have a Net cast o'r Th' Artyllery Yard, and send for th' Gentleman That bridles Stags, and makes 'em draw Caroches, Hee'l exercise 'em in a Month or two, And bring 'em to it easily. Phil. We must carry Six or sev'n hundred of Bird-Cages And Cony-Coopes along with us. Mach. For what? Phil. T' imprison Rebels, and there feed 'em up With Milk, and Dazy-roots. I will so yerk The little Gentlemen. Cos. You must not play The Tyrant o'r the Wretches. Phil. You shall see [Draws her Sword. How I'l behave my self. This foreside blow Cuts off thrice three, this back-blow thrice three more, This foreright thrust spits half a dozen of 'em, Bucklers and all, like so many Larkes with Sage Between them; then this down-right cleaves a stubborn Two-footed Rebell from the Crown o'th' head Down to the twist, and makes him double forked Like a Turn Stile, or some such Engin. Others I'l knock pall-mall, and make the wretched Caitiffs Measure their length upon their Mother Earth, And so bestride 'em, and cry Victory. Mach. And what'l you do, when you are seated in The Throne, to win your Subjects Love Philenis? Phil. I'l stand upon a Cricket, and there make Fluent Orations to 'em; call 'em Trusty And Well-beloved, Loyall, and True Subjects, And my good People; Then I'l mount on Horseback, Shew 'em my little Majesty, and scatter Five or six hundred single pence among 'em, Teach 'em good Language by cleft sticks, and Bay-leaves, And Civilize 'em finally by Puppet-Plays. Cos. Most studi'd, and advis'd! Pan. The heart of Wisdome! Rho. And Soul of Policy! Mach. Come little Queen, Wee'l go and make her Majesty acquainted With all the Plot; 'twill take her certainly. Exeunt. Scen. II. Adraste, Lucasia, Charistus, Olyndus, Eumela, Florina, Malthora, in Myrtle wreathes. Adr. VVas all the Treasure ship'd? Eum. All, but the Pictures, And Statues, they'r reserv'd. I saw the Luxury, And wealth of Cyprus sail. The Souldier doth By this time gaze upon't. Adr. The news, Charistus, Of your Adventures here, I dare presume Hath joyn'd both Armies now. Me thinks I see The Cyprians standing here, the Cretans there, And, in a space between them, both Kings meeting In a most strong Embrace, and so provoking Clamors and shouts from both sides, and a joyfull Clattring of Weapons. Cha. Beautious Queen, your Vertues Are greater far than Fame; and you your self Greater than them! Though Gold and Purple do Adorn your head, yet you have Wove your self Far richer Diadems from your Royall Acts, And made your self Immortall by producing Immortall things. But though your wreath of Vertue Hath made what e'r the Sun beholds in all His course enamor'd by you, yet if I May pull one single one from out the rest, There's none, for which you have more Altars rais'd Unto your Name, than for that Noble Love, Whose flames you keep still burning in your self, And cherish in all others. Adr. Sir, you have Conquer'd A Princess, and in her a Queen: I am Th' addition to your Triumph. We ow much To you Olyndus. Olyn. I can challenge nothing But my Charistus Friendship. 'Tis to him You ow these seeds of Peace. Although his Father Appear'd so tender of him, that when he Came hither secretly to view the Rites Of Venus, which Lucasia then perform'd, The aged Man hasted to th' Oracle To know what Fortune should attend his Son, And, for an unexpected answer, did Banish those Priests for which our King now fights: Yet for all this, ev'n in this heat of danger, H' hath made another Venture, and the Kingdom Now grieves his second loss. Adr. Do you know the answer That the God gave to his enquiring Father, For which the King did banish all the Priests? Olyn. I may repeat it now, th' Event assures me It meant you no Misfortune, It was this; Charistus shall his Country save, If he become his Enemies Slave. Adr. I hope th' Event will not fulfill it. Olyn. 'Tis Fulfill'd enough to make an Oracle true. Adr. I hope you have no Enemies, and for Slave The Gods avert it! Olyn. He's Lucasia's Servant, There's that fulfill'd; Cyprus is now reputed The Enemy to Crete; but as for true And reall Enemies to you Charistus, The World hath none so Barbarous; your Vertues Have under this disguise shew'd so much Prince, That they betrai'd you still to any Eye That could discern. Cha. Honour'd Olyndus, you Outdo me still. Friends should be alwaies equall: You must take off, and pare your Vertues, that You may go even with me. I ow much To you, Eumela, too. Adr. Her service hath Preserv'd the Kingdom, and refounded Cyprus. Cha. Two Scepters are her Debters. Adr. But, Eumela, You might have told me sooner, that Lucasia Began to feel a Passion; you ne'r knew That I destroy'd true vertuous Loves; it is A pleasure to me to perceive their Buddings, To know their Minutes of Encrease, their Stealths, And silent Growings; and I have not spar'd To help, and bring them on. Eum. You have so favour'd Agreeing Souls, that all the VVorld confesseth Your own is perfect Harmony. But where The God is Blind, should not the Creature be Silent, and Close? That which is bred by whispers VVould dye if once proclam'd. Luc. If it were any, It was a fault of Trust; 'tis more Injustice To betray secret Love, than to make known Counsels of State. Cupid hath his Cabinet, To which, if any prove unfaithfull, he Straight wounds him with the Leaden Shaft, and so They live tormented, and dye scorn'd. Adr. No more; 'Tis well: I meant not to Accuse, but Praise. Have you set some to watch, and signifie The King's Return? Eum. Three peacefull Courtiers, Lerinus, and Ganyctor, and Iringus, Desir'd that they might bring the News, and so Are gone unto the Port. Adr. My Ladies, you I hope will clear up now. Flor. I have too much Joy to express it. Mal. Could you see my heart, You'd view a Triumph there. Scen. III. To them Philænis. Phil. And't please your Highness There are three Ladies wait without, who, if You have a vacant Ear, are come t' inform you Of something neer concerns the State. Adr. The old Vexation's busie still—Pandena and Cosmeta, and the other—are they not? Tell 'em they may come in—How shall we do, Eumela, now to stop their Clamour? [Ex. Phi. Eum. 'Tis easie; There's nothing yet provided; the Return O'th' King being now so sudden, 'twill amaze 'em, And make 'em kneel for mercy to you, if You do but threaten to disclose the Plot. Scen. IV. To them Cosmeta, Pandena, Rhodia. Adr. Your business Ladies? Cos. Please you to dismiss Those Faces that have Beards? Adr. Fear not, they shall not Betray your Counsels. Cos. Please your Highness then, There's fear that our Design will come to nought, Our Trust is falsifi'd. Adr. How so? Cos. VVe came To ask Machessa about VVeapons, and She presently demands, how many cases Of Knives, what Forks we have, Tosting, or Carving? Pan. Talk we of Swords, she asks what Crisping Pins And Bodkins we could guess might easily be Rais'd through the Common-wealth? Rho. VVe spake of Armour, She straight replies, send in your steel Combs, with The Steels you see your Faces in, wee'l quickly Convert 'em into Greaves, and Gorgets. Cos. If This be not treason 'gainst the Female State, Beleeve not Policy, nor me. Eum. Why she Was your own choice; you cri'd her up as one That having neither Child, nor Husband, would Take to her self the Commonwealth as both. Cos. We do suspect your sadness sweet Florina. Rho. And your retir'dness too Malthora, (as Demure as you stand here) is deep engag'd. Pan. Nor is Eumela free. Mal. VVhence do you gather it? Cos. Pray y' why those Myrtle wreaths? why your Gates drest? And your Doors Crown'd? Flo. In hope our Lords will shortly Enter, and Crown 'em more. Cos. Most evident Can there be bolder Falshood? Did we not Agree to keep out Husbands from our City And our Minds too? And yet behold there are Garlands and Flowers prepar'd; and they to be Receiv'd as Lovers. Husbands are at best But a sad kind of pleasure; one good Look, And a Salute's enough at any time For the Good-man o'th' Family. Flo. Pray y' allow Affection more Expressions; Love doth cease To be, when that it breaks not out into Those signs of Joy; as Souls cease to be Souls VVhen they leave off to shew their Operations. Pan. This is no time for vain Philosophy, VVe are to have a fine State of it shortly, VVhen Ladies once begin to utter Axioms, And raise a Faction 'gainst the seven Sages. Scen. V. Machessa. Mac. And't please your Highness, three Embassadors, Sent from the Cretan State, do crave admittance. Adr. Usher 'em in. [Ex. Ma. [Eum. whispers the Qu. Cos. There's life you see i'th' bus'ness; Let's yet be true. The fame of our Exploit Already makes us sought to. There's an Honour Not usuall too i'th' Number of 'em; when Arriv'd there three before from the same State? And 't please you, let Pandena, Rhodia, and I, Manage their Entertainment? Adr. Do so. Pan. It shall All be to th' honour of the Female State. Cos. Prepare your self Pandena, here they come. Scene VI. To them Machessa ushering Lerinus, Iringus, and Ganyctor, as Embassadors. Ler. Most Gratious, most Renowned, and most Beautious. Cos. Pray y' be not troublesome; We're taken up VVholy with the Affairs o'th' Kingdom now. Irin. VVhen will your Ladiship have a Vacancy? Pan. You are Impertinent; True Politicians Do never use to answer on the sudden. Rho. It is not now as heretofore; the times Are grown more wise, and more reserv'd; there are Matters on foot far greater; you must wait— You are Embassadors. Gan. We should not think so, But that you're pleas'd to tell us so; your usage Hath a far different Dialect from your Tongue. Cos. Were there not VVomen in your Kingdom fit For this Imployment? I perceive your State Is utterly unfurnish'd, that it cannot Send forth three Female Agents. Irin. 'Tis not, Madam, The custome of our Master to commit His Kingdom's secrets to a peece of Chrystall; That were not to Negotiate, but Betray. Pa. You shall meet VVomen here, that are not Crystal, Those that will find out you, and hide themselves. Rho. You shall not need the help of an Interpreter VVhen we give Audience; Speak what Tongue you will You shall be understood, each one of us Hath more than one. Ler. VVe easily beleeve it, Though you should speak none else besides your Native. Cos. Pray stand you by, and wait a while. Ler. VVe obey. Cos. Now will they think the better of us; 'tis The way to bring our selves in Credit by Neglecting of 'em thus. I'd have 'em know VVe were to be saluted at their coming. Pan. Their State is very unhappy, that it is So unprovided: I beleeve these are The very wisest in the Kingdom; for They have no Manners. Rho. You guess rightly, Madam; The greatest Counsellors and Lawyers scarce Know how to make a Leg. Scen. VII. To them Philænis. Phil. Arm, arm, arm, arm, The King, and Lords are within sight. Here Madam, Pray take my Sword, and Helmet. Cos. Worthy Gentlemen, Do y' come to proffer aid from th' Cretan King To help us 'gainst the Men? Irin. No Ladies: we Come but to tell you that the King is Landed, They discover themselves. We are your fellow-Subjects. Cos. Fellow-Villaines Among your selves. Eumela, we may thank You for all this. Pan. But Sister of the Sword, Great Lady Stickler— Mach. Be patient pray y' a while—Take you this Helmet, And you this Fauchion Sir, and you this Lance; Embassadours still must be dismiss'd with Presents. Rho. Where is our Plate? Pan. Our Wealth? Cos. Our Jewels? Mach. Folly! Did not my Order bind me to assist Distressed men? Cos. Who would e'r trust a VVoman? Mach. The Queen will give y' a fair account. Adr. 'Tis no Time to debate things now. The truth is, all VVas ship'd, and sent the King, as one great Present From all the Cyprian VVomen. If you do Desire that he should know how it was rais'd, For what intended, by what means diverted, I'l bid him spare his thanks, and tell him 'twas Not Bounty, but Misfortune that directed This vast Supply to him. Cos. We hope your Highness Will be so Gratious to us, as to let us Make the best use yet of our Evils. 'Twill Be something, if that, which was meant Sedition, May now be took for Contribution, And we esteem'd Relievers of the Army. Adr. I do engage my Royall word, you shall Be put in th' Annals, as good Members of The Cyprian Commonwealth. But heark, the noise! The Horses, Trumpets, Priests! They come! stand off. Scen. VIII. To them 3 Priests of Apollo with wreaths of Lawrell, Demarchus and Dinomachus hand in hand, Pæstanus, Philondas, Souldiers. The Priests standing on one side, and the Ladies on the other, leaving a free space between 'em, in which Demarchus and Adraste first meet. Then Dinomachus and Adraste receive Charistus and Lucasia; Then Philondas meets Malthora; Then the King and Queen joyn Olyndus and Eumela; The rest then salute, and receive one another with Welcome; While they all thus meet, the Priests on the one side, and the Ladies on the other, sing thus enterchangeably. 1 Priest, Apollo, who foretell'st what shall ensue, None speaks more Dark than thou, but none More true; If Heard, Obscure; but yet if Seen, most Bright; Day's in thy Visage, in thy Sayings Night. Pr. Cho. Day's in thy Visage, in thy Sayings Night. 1 Lady. Venus makes good what he Decrees, And Love fulfils what he foresees, Thus Gods help Gods, thus Mortals ow Much to the Bayes, much to the Bow. La. Cho. Much to the Bayes, much to the Bow. 2 Priest. Phœbus as Præsent shewes us future things, Our Trivets Counsell give, our Trees teach Kings, And whil'st our Oracle instructs the State, What e'r the Priest shall say the God makes Fate. Pr. Cho. What e'r the Priest shall say the God makes Fate. 2 Lady. What are your Trivets to Loves wings? They Teach, but these do Conquer Kings: Venus to Fate adds all the bliss, She that makes Doves, makes Kingdoms kiss. La. Cho. She that makes Doves makes Kingdoms kiss. La. &amp; Pr. Thus then the Myrtle and the Bayes we joyn. Chorus. And in one Wreath Wisdom and Love Combine. Dem. I never raign'd till now. You needed not Have sent that Ample Treasure; I had all Wealth in your Loves. Come, Great Dinomachus, As they joyn'd Voices, so let us joyn Hearts. Dino. Sir, your Embraces vanquish far beyond Your Sword, though happy; you march Conquerour More by a Glorious Peace, than if your Arm Had scatter'd Deaths still as you pass'd; your Throne Grows hence; y'have gain'd what e'r you have not ruin'd; Your Pow'r rules Cyprus, but your Fame the World. Dem. Hate only is between th' Ignoble, when The Good dissent, 'tis only difference, No malice; Vertue flames in both, and so Each must the other Love; their Discords are More blameless than th' Embraces of the Bad; 'Tis to stand off, rather than bear a Grudge. And if they fight, when e'r they do lay down Their VVeapons, they lay down their Anger too, As we affect then to seem good, and are so, Let one Oblivion wrap up what hath past On either side. Dino. But I must first ask Pardon; I've wrong'd a Deity. Great Apollo, be Thou still propitious. Here I do restore Thy Blameless Priests. VVhat was but only Darkness, I thought Contrivance; and the Priest not Loyall, Because the God was pleas'd to be obscure: But now th' Event lends light to that, and Me; And my Charistus doth his Country save By being thus become his Enemi's Slave. Peace rest upon 'em both; Apollo spoke it, And Venus hath perform'd it. Dem. As they joyn'd To make us happy, so let us pay back United Thanks, and joyn their Deities in A double Feast. It is not Mens Lot only To need each other; ev'n the Pow'rs themselves Give and take help. Affection brings about VVhat Counsell cannot. Thus the Gods have lent Love unto VVisdome for an Instrument.

      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue. Though we well know the Neighbouring Plain Can strike from Reeds as high a Strain, And that the Scrip, and Crook May worst our Poet's Book; Like Fayries yet we here could stay Till Village Cocks proclame the Day: And whiles your Pleasure is the Theam, Feed and keep up the Dream. But Sleep beginning now to shed Poppies on every Bed, Love stay'd his hands, and said our Eyes This Night were made his Prize: And now (instead of Poppies) flings These wishes on you from his wings. The Calm of Kingdoms new made Friends, When both enjoy their Hopes, and Ends, The like in you Create, And make each Mind a State: The thoughts of Princes, when they do Meet Princes to coyn Princes too, Possess your Breasts with Fire and Youth, And make each dream a Truth: The Joyes of Friendship after Fight, Of Love's first happy Night, Of Lords return'd, make you still greet, As when you first did meet. And, quitted thus from Grief and Fear, Think you enjoy a Cyprus here.</field>
