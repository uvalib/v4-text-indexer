      <field name="fulltext">To my owne friend, Master Iohn Ford, on his Iustifiable Poem of Perkin Warbeck, This Ode. They, who doe know mee, know, that I (Vnskil'd to flatter) Dare speake This Piece, in words, in matter, A Worke: without the daunger of the Lye. Beleeue mee (friend) the name of This, and Thee, Will liue, your Storie: Bookes may want Faith, or merit, glorie; This, neither; without Iudgement's Lethargie. When the Arts doate, then, some sicke Poet, may Hope, that his penne In new-staind-paper, can finde men To roare, HE is The Wit's; His Noyse doth sway. But such an Age cannot be know'n: for All, E're that Time bee, Must proue such Truth, mortalitie: So (friend) thy honour stand's too fixt, to fall. George Donne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his worthy friend, Master John Ford, vpon his Perkin Warbeck. Let men, who are writt Poets, lay a claime To the Phebean Hill, I haue no name, Nor art in Verse; True, I haue heard some tell Of Aganippe, but ne're knew the Well: Therefore haue no ambition with the Times, To be in Print, for making of ill Rimes; But loue of Thee, and Iustice to thy Penne Hath drawne mee to this Barre, with other men To justifie, though against double Lawes, (Waving the subtill bus'nesse of his cause) The Gloriovs Perkin, and thy Poet's Art Equall with His, in playing the Kings Part. Ra: E'ure Baronis Primogen:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my faithfull, no lesse deserving friend, the Authour; This indebted Oblation. Perkin is rediviu'd by thy strong hand, And crownd' a King of new; the vengefull wand Of Greatnesse is forgot: His Execution May rest vn-mention'd; and His birth's Collusion Lye buried in the Storie: But His fame Thou has't eterniz'd; made a Crowne His Game. His loftie spirit soares yet. Had He been Base in his enterprise, as was his sinne Conceiv'd, His Title, (doubtlesse) prou'd vnjust, Had, but for Thee, been silenc't in his dust. George Crymes, miles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Authour, his friend, vpon his Chronicle Historie. These are not to expresse thy witt, But to pronounce thy Iudgement fitt; In full-fil'd phrase, those Times to rayse, When Perkin ran his wilie wayes. Still, let the methode of thy brayne, From Errours touch, and Envy's stayne Preserue Thee, free; that eu'r, thy quill Fayre Truth may wett, and Fancy fill. Thus Graces are, with Muses mett, And practick Critick's on may frett: For heere, Thou hast produc't, A Storie, Which shall ecclipfe, Their future Glorie. Iohn Brograue: Ar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my friend, and kinsman, Master Iohn Ford, the Authour. Drammatick Poets (as the Times goe) now Can hardly write, what others will allow; The Cynick snarl's; the Critick howles and barkes; And Ravens croake, to drowne the voyce of Larkes: Scorne those Stage-Harpyes! This I'le boldly say, Many may imitate, few match thy Play. Iohn Ford: Graiensis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGVE. Studyes haue, of this Nature, been of late So out of fashion, so vnfollow'd; that It is become more Iustice, to reviue The antick follyes of the Times, then striue To countenance wise Industrie: no want Of Art, doth render witt, or lame, or scant, Or slothfull, in the purchase of fresh bayes; But want of Truth in Them, who giue the prayse To their selfe-loue, presuming to out-doe The Writer, or (for need) the Actor's too. But such This Avthovr's silence best befitt's, Who bidd's Them, be in loue, with their owne witt's: From Him, to cleerer Iudgement's, wee can say, Hee shew's a Historie, couch't in a Play: A Historie of noble mention, knowne, Famous, and true: most noble, 'cause our owne: Not forg'd from Italie, from Fraunce, from Spaine, But Chronicled at Home; as rich in strayne Of braue Attempts, as ever, fertile Rage In Action, could beget to grace the Stage Wee cannot limitt Scenes, for the whole Land It selfe, appeard too narrow to with-stand Competitors for Kingdomes: nor is heere Vnnecessary mirth forc't, to indeere A multitude; on these two, rest's the Fate Of worthy expectation; Ttvth and State.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus Scæna prima. Enter King Henry, Durham, Oxford, Surrey, Sir William Stanly, Lord Chamberlaine, Lord Dawbny. The King supported to his Throne by Stanly and Durham. A Guard. King. Still to be haunted; still to be pursued, Still to be frighted with false apparitions Of pageant Majestie, and new-coynd greatnesse, As if wee were a mockery King in state; Onely ordaind to lauish sweat and bloud In scorne and laughter to the ghosts of Yorke, Is all below our merits; yet (my Lords, My friends and Counsailers) yet we sit fast In our owne royall birth-right; the rent face And bleeding wounds of England's slaughterd people, Haue beene by vs (as by the best Physitian) At last both throughly Cur'd, and set in safetie; And yet for all this glorious worke of peace Our selfe is scarce secure. Dur: The rage of malice Conjures fresh spirits with the spells of Yorke; For ninetie yeares ten English Kings and Princes, Threescore great Dukes and Earles, a thousand Lords And valiant Knights, two hundred fiftie thousand Of English Subiects haue in Ciuill Warres, Beene sacrificd to an vnciuill thirst Of discord and ambition: this hot vengeance Of the just powers aboue, to vtter ruine And Desolation had raign'd on, but that Mercie did gently sheath the sword of Iustice, In lending to this bloud-shrunck Common-wealth A new soule, new birth in your Sacred person. Daw: Edward the fourth after a doubtfull fortune Yeelded to nature; leaving to his sonnes Edward and Richard, the inheritance Of a most bloudy purchase; these young Princes Richard the Tirant their vnnaturall Vncle Forc'd to a violent graue, so just is Heauen. Him hath your Majestie by your owne arme Divinely strengthen'd, pulld from his Boares stie And strucke the black Vsurper to a Carkasse: Nor doth the House of Yorke decay in Honors, Tho Lancaster doth repossesse his right. For Edwards daughter is King Henries Queene. A blessed Vnion, and a lasting blessing For this poore panting Iland, if some shreds Some vselesse remnant of the House of Yorke Grudge not at this Content. Ox: Margaret of Burgundy Blowes fresh Coales of Division. Sur: Painted fires Without to heate or scortch, or light to cheerish. Daw: Yorkes headlesse trunck her Father, Edwards fate Her brother King, the smothering of her Nephewes By Tirant Gloster, brother to her nature; Nor Glosters owne confusion, (all decrees Sacred in Heauen) Can moue this Woman-Monster, But that shee still from the vnbottom'd myne Of Devilish policies, doth vent the Ore Of troubles and sedition. Ox: In her age (Great Sir, obserue the Wonder) shee growes fruitfull, Who in her strength of youth was alwayes barraine Nor are her birthes as other Mothers are, At nine or ten moneths end, shee has beene with childe Eight or seaven yeares at least; whose twinnes being borne (A prodegie in Nature) even the youngest Is fifteene yeares of age at his first entrance As soone as knowne 'ith world, tall striplings, strong And able to giue battaile vnto Kings. Idolls of Yorkish malice. Ox: And but Idolls, A steelie hammer Crushes 'em to peeces. K: Lambert the eldest (Lords) is in our service, Prefer'd by an officious care of Dutie From the Scullery to a Faulkner (strange example!) Which shewes the difference betweene noble natures And the base borne: but for the vpstart Duke, The new reviu'd Yorke, Edwards second sonne, Murder'd long since 'ith Towre; he liues againe And vowes to be your King. Stan: The throne is filld Sir. K: True Stanlie, and the lawfull heire sitts on it; A guard of Angells, and the holy prayers Of loyall Subjects are a sure defence Against all force and Counsaile of Intrusion. But now (my Lords) put case some of our Nobles, Our Great Ones, should giue Countenance and Courage To trim Duke Perkin; you will all confesse Our bounties haue vnthriftily beene scatter'd Amongst vnthankfull men. Daw: Vnthankfull beasts, Dogges, villaines, traytors. K: Dawbney let the guiltie Keepe silence, I accuse none, tho I know, Forraigne attempts against a State and Kingdome Are seldome without some great friends at home. Stan: Sir, if no other abler reasons else Of dutie or alegiance could divert A head-strong resolution, yet the dangers So lately past by men of bloud and fortunes In Lambert Simnells partie, must Command More than a feare, a terror to Conspiracie, The high-borne Lincolne, sonne to De la Pole, The Earle of Kildare, Lord Geraldine, Francis Lord Louell, and the German Baron, Bould Martin Swart, with Broughton and the rest, (Most spectacles of ruine, some of mercy;) Are presidents sufficient to forewarne The present times, or any that liue in them, What follie, nay, what madnesse 'twere to lift A finger vp in all defence but yours, Which can be but impostorous in a title. K. Stanlie wee know thou lou'st Vs, and thy heart Is figur'd on thy tongue; nor thinke wee lesse Of anie's here, how closely wee haue hunted This Cubb (since he vnlodg'd) from hole to hole, Your knowledge is our Chronicle: first Ireland The common stage of Noveltie, presented This gewgaw to oppose vs, there the Geraldines And Butlers once againe stood in support Of this Colossicke statue: Charles of Fraunce Thence call'd him into his protection; Dissembled him the lawfull heire of England; Yet this was all but French dissimulation, Ayming at peace with vs, which being granted On honorable termes on our part, suddenly This smoake of straw was packt from Fraunce againe, T'infect some grosser ayre; and now wee learne (Mauger the malice of the bastard Nevill, Sir Talor, and a hundred English Rebells) Thei'r all retir'd to Flaunders, to the Dam That nurst this eager Wholpe, Margaret of Burgundie. But wee will hunt him there too, wee will hunt him, Hunt him to death euen in the Beldams Closet, Tho the Arch-duke were his Buckler. Sur: Shee has stil'd him—The faire white rose of England. Daw: Iollie Gentleman, more fit to be a Swabber To the Flemish after a drunken surfet. Enter Vrswick. Vr: Gracious Soueraigne, please you peruse this paper. Dur: The Kings Countenance, gathers a sprightly bloud: Daw: Good newes beleeue it. K: Vrswick thine eare— Th'ast lodgd him? Vr: Strongly, safe Sir. K: Enough, is Barly come to? Vr: No, my Lord. K: No matter—phew, hee's but a running weede, At pleasure to be pluck'd vp by the rootes: But more of this anon—I haue bethought mee. (My Lords) for reasons which you shall pertake, It is our pleasure to remoue our Court From Westminster to th'Tower: Wee will lodge This very night there, giue Lord Chamberlaine A present order for it. Stan: The Tower—I shall sir. K: Come my true, best, fast friends, these clouds will vanish, The Sunne will shine at full: the Heauens are clearing. Exeunt. Flourish. Enter Huntley and Daliell. Hun: You trifle time Sir. Dal: Oh my noble Lord, You conster my griefes to so hard a sence, That where the text is argument of pittie, Matter of earnest loue, your glosse corrupts it With too much ill plac'd mirth. Hunt: Much mirth Lord Daliell? Not so I vow: obserue mee sprightly gallant: I know thou art a noble ladd, a hansome, Discended from an honorable Auncestrie, Forward and actiue, do'st resolue to wrestle, And ruffle in the world by noble actions For a braue mention to posteritie: I scorne not thy affection to my Daughter, Not I by good St. Andrew; but this bugg-beare, This whoresome tale of honor, (honor Daliell) So hourely chatts, and tattles in mine eare, The peece of royaltie that is stitch'd vp In my Kates bloud, that 'tis as dangerous For thee young Lord, to pearch so neere an Eaglet, As foolish for my gravitie to admit it. I haue spoake all at once. Dal: Sir, with this truth You mix such Worme wood, that you leaue no hope For my disorderd palate, ere to rellish A wholesome taste againe; alas, I know Sir, What an vnequall distance lies betweene Great Huntlies Daughters birth, and Daliells fortunes. Shee's the Kings kinswoman, plac'd neere the Crowne, A Princesse of the bloud, and I a Subject. Hunt: Right, but a noble Subject, put in that too. Dal: I could adde more; and in the rightest line, Deriue my pedigree from Adam Mure, A Scottish Knight; whose daughter, was the mother To him who first begot the race of Iameses, That sway the Scepter to this very day. But kindreds are not ours, when once the date Of many yeares, haue swallowed vp the memory Of their originalls: So pasture fields Neighbouring too neere the Ocean, are soopd vp And knowne no more: for stood I in my first And natiue greatnesse, if my Princely Mistresse Voutsafd mee not her servant, 'twere as good I were reduc'd to Clownery; to nothing As to a throane of Wonder. Hunt: Now by Saint Andrew A sparke of mettall, a'has a braue fire in him. I would a had my Daughter so I knewt not. But must not bee so, must not:—well young Lord This will not doe yet, if the girle be headstrong And will not harken to good Counsaile, steale her And runne away with her, daunce galliards, doe, And friske about the world to learne the Languages: T'will be a thriving trade; you may set vp by't. Dal: With pardon (noble Gourdon) this disdaine Suites not your Daughters vertue, or my constancie. Hunt: You are angrie—would awould beate me, I deserue it. Daliell thy hand, w'are friends; follow thy Courtship Take thine owne time and speake, if thou prevail'st With passion more then I can with my Counsaile, Shees thine, nay, shee is thine, tis a faire match Free and allowed, Ile onely vse my tongue Without a Fathers power, use thou thine: Selfe doe selfe haue, no more words, winne and weare her. Dal: You blesse mee, I am now too poore in thankes To pay the debt I owe you. Hunt: Nay, th'art poore enough—I loue his spirit infinitely, Looke yee, shee comes, to her now, to her, to her. Enter Katherine and Iane. Kat: The King commands your presence Sir. Hunt: The gallant—this this this Lord, this Servant (Kate) of yours, desires to be your Maister. Kat: I acknowledge him, a worthy friend of mine. Dal: Your humblest Creature. Hunt: So, so, the games a foote, I'me in cold hunting, The hare and hounds are parties. Dal: Princely Lady,—how most vnworthy I am to imploy My services, in honour of your vertues, How hopelesse my desires are to enjoy Your faire opinion, and much more your loue; Are onely matter of despaire, vnlesse Your goodnesse giue large warrant to my boldnesse, My feeble-wing'd ambition. Hunt: This is scurvie. Kat: My Lord I interrupt you not. Hunt: Indeede? Now on my life sheel Court him—nay, nay, on Sir. Dal: Oft haue I tun'd the lesson of my sorrowes To sweeten discord, and inrich your pittie; But all in vaine: heere had my Comforts sunck And never ris'n againe, to tell a storie Of the despairing Louer, had not now Even now the Earle your Father. Hunt: A meanes mee sure. Dal: After some fit disputes of your Condition, Your highnesse and my lownesse, giv'n a licence Which did not more embolden, then encourage My faulting tongue. Hunt: How how? how's that? Embolden? Encourage? I encourage yee? d'ee heare sir? A subtill trick, a queint one,—will you heare (man) What did I say to you, come come toth poynt. Kate: It shall not neede my Lord. Hunt: Then heare mee Kate: Keepe you on that hand of her; I on this— Thou standst betweene a Father and a Suiter, Both striving for an interest in thy heart: Hee Courts thee for affection, I for dutie; Hee as a servant pleads, but by the priviledge Of nature, tho I might Command, my care Shall onely Counsaile what it shall not force. Thou canst but make one choyce, the tyes of marriage Are tenures not at will, but during life. Consider whoes thou art, and who; a Princesse, A Princesse of the royall bloud of Scotland. In the full spring of youth, and fresh in beautie. The King that sits vpon the throne is young And yet vnmarryed, forward in attempts On any least occasion, to endanger His person; Wherefore Kate as I am confident Thou dar'st not wrong thy birth and education By yeelding to a common servile rage Of female wantonnesse, so I am confident Thou wilt proportion all thy thoughts to side Thy equalls, if not equall thy superiors. My Lord of Daliell young in yeares, is old In honors, but nor eminent in titles Or in estate, that may support or adde to The expectation of thy fortunes, settle Thy will and reason by a strength of Iudgement; For in a word, I giue thee freedome, take it. If equall fates haue not ordain'd to pitch Thy hopes aboue my height, let not thy passion Leade thee to shrinke mine honor in oblivion: Thou art thine owne; I haue done. Dal: Oh! y'are all Oracle, The living stocke and roote of truth and wisedome. Kat: My worthiest Lord and Father, the indulgence Of your sweete composition, thus commands The lowest of obedience, you haue graunted A libertie so large, that I want skill To choose without direction of Example: From which I daily learne, by how much more You take off from the roughnesse of a Father, By so much more I am engag'd to tender The dutie of a Daughter. For respects Of birth, degrees of title, and advancement, I nor admire, nor slight them; all my studies Shall ever ayme at this perfection onely, To liue and dye so, that you may not blush In any course of mine to owne mee yours. Hunt: Kate, Kate, thou grow'st vpon my heart, like peace, Creating every other houre a Iubile. Kate: To you my Lord of Daliell, I addresse Some few remaining words, the generall fame That speakes your merit even in vulgar tongues, Proclaimes it cleare; but in the best a President. Hunt: Good wench, good girle y' fayth. Kat: For my part (trust mee) I value mine owne worth at higher rate, Cause you are pleasd to prize it; if the streame Of your protested service (as you terme it) Runne in a constancie, more then a Complement; It shall be my delight, that worthy loue Leades you to worthy actions; and these guide yee Richly to wedde an honourable name: So every vertuous praise, in after ages, Shall be your heyre, and I in your braue mention, Be Chronicled the Mother of that issue, That glorious issue. Hunt: Oh that I were young againe, Sheed make mee Court proud danger, and sucke spirit From reputation. Kat: To the present motion, Heeres all that I dare answer: when a ripenesse Of more experience, and some vse of time, Resolues to treate the freedome of my youth Vpon exchange of troathes, I shall desire No surer credit, of a match with vertue, Then such as liues in you; meane time, my hopes are Preser'd secure, in having you a friend. Dal: You are a blessed Lady, and instruct Ambition not to soare a farther flight, Then in the perfum'd ayre of your soft voyce. My noble Lord of Huntley, you haue lent A full extent of bountie to this parley; And for it, shall command your humblest servant. Hunt: Enough; wee are still friends, and will continue A heartie loue, oh Kate, thou art mine owne:— No more, my Lord of Crawford. Enter Crawford. Craw. From the King I come my Lord of Huntley, Who in Counsaile requires your present ayde. Hunt: Some weightie businesse! Craw: A Secretarie from a Duke of Yorke, The second sonne to the late English Edward, Conceal'd I know not where these fourteen yeares, Craues audience from our Maister, and tis said The Duke himselfe is following to the Court. Hunt: Duke vpon Duke; tis well; 'tis well heeres bustling For Majestie; my Lord, I will along with yee. Craw: My service noble Lady, Kat: Please yee walke sir? Dal: “Times haue their changes, sorrow makes men wise, “The Sunne it selfe must sett as well as rise; Then why not I—faire Maddam I waite on yee. Exeunt omnes. Enter Durham, Sir Robert Clifford, and Vrswick: Lights. Dur: You finde (Sir Robert Clifford) how securely King Henry our great Maister, doth commit His person to your loyaltie; you taste His bountie and his mercy even in this; That at a time of night so late, a place So private as his Closet, hee is pleasd To admit you to his favour; doe not faulter In your Discovery, but as you covet A liberall grace, and pardon for your follies, So labour to deserue it, by laying open All plotts, all persons, that contriue against it. Vrs: Remember not the witchcraft, or the Magick, The charmes, and incantations, which the Sorceresse Of Burgundie hath cast vpon your reason! Sir Robert bee your owne friend now, discharge Your conscience freely, all of such as loue you, Stand sureties for your honestie and truth. Take heede you doe not dallie with the King, He is wise as he is gentle. Cliff: I am miserable, If Henry be not mercifull. Vrs: The King comes. Enter King Henry. K: H: Clifford! Cliff: Let my weake knees rot on the earth, If I appeare as leap'rous in my treacheries, Before your royall eyes; as to mine owne I seeme a Monster, by my breach of truth. K: H: Clifford stand vp, for instance of thy safetie I offer thee my hand. Cliff. A soveraigne Balme For my bruis'd Soule, I kisse it with a greedinesse. Sir you are a just Master, but I— K: H: Tell me, is every circumstance, thou hast set downe With thine owne hand, within this paper true? Is it a sure intelligence of all The progresse of our enemies intents Without corruption? Cliff: True, as I wish heaven; Or my infected honor white againe. K: H: Wee know all (Clifford) fully, since this meteor This ayrie apparition first discradled From Tournay into Portugall; and thence Advanc'd his firie blaze for adoration Toth superstitious Irish; since the beard Of this wilde Comet, Conjur'd into Fraunce, Sparkled in antick flames in Charles his Court: But shrunke againe from thence, and hid in darknesse, Stole into Flaunders, flourishing the ragges Of painted power on the shore of Kent, Whence hee was beaten backe with shame and scorne, Contempt, and slaughter of some naked out-lawes: But tell me, what new course now shapes Duke Perkin? Cliff: For Ireland (mightie Henrie:) so instructed By Stephen Frion, sometimes Secretarie In the French tongue vnto your sacred Excellence, But Perkins tutor now. K: H: A subtill villaine! That Frion, Frion,—you my Lord of Durham Knew well the man. Dur. French both in heart and actions! K: H: Some Irish heads worke in this mine of treason; Speake em! Cliff. Not any of the best; your fortune Hath dulld their spleenes; never had Counterfeit Such a confused rabble of lost Banquerouts For Counsellors: first Heron a broken Mercer, Then Iohn a Water, sometimes Major of Corke, Sketon a taylor and a Scrivenor Calld Astley: and what ere these list to treate of, Perkin must harken to; but Frion, cunning Aboue these dull capacities, still prompts him, To flie to Scotland to young Iames the fourth; And sue for ayde to him; this is the latest Of all their resolutions. K. H. Still more Frion. Pestilent Adder, hee will hisse out poyson As dang'rous as infections—we must match 'em. Clifford thou hast spoke home, wee giue thee life: But Clifford, there are people of our owne Remaine behinde vntold, who are they Clifford? Name those and wee are friends, and will to rest, Tis thy last taske. Cliff. Oh Sir, here I must breake A most vnlawfull Oath to keepe a just one. K. H. Well, well, be briefe, be briefe. Cliff. The first in ranck Shall be Iohn Ratcliffe, Lord Fitzwater, then Sir Simon Mountford, and Sir Thomas Thwaites, With William Dawbegney, Chessoner, Astwood, Worsley the Deane of Paules, two other Fryars, And Robert Ratcliffe. K. H. Church-men are turn'd Divells. These are the principall. Cliff. One more remaines Vn-nam'd, whom I could willingly forget. K. H. Ha Clifford, one more? Cliff. Great Sir, do not heare him: For when Sir William Stanlie your Lord Chamberlaine Shall come into the list, as he is chiefe I shall loose credit with yee, yet this Lord, Last nam'd, is first against you. K. H. Vrswick the light, view well my face Sirs, Is there bloud left in it? Dur. You alter Strangely Sir. K. H. Alter Lord Bishop? Why Clifford stab'd mee, or I dream'd a'stabd mee. Sirra, it is a custome with the guiltie To thinke they set their owne staines off, by laying Aspersions on some nobler then themselues: Lyes waite on treasons, as I finde it here. Thy life againe is forfeit, I recall My word of mercy, for I know thou dar'st Repeate the name no more. Cliff. I dare, and once more Vpon my knowledge, name Sir William Stanlie Both in his counsaile, and his purse, the chiefe Assistant, to the fain'd Duke of Yorke. Dur: Most strange! Vrs: Most wicked! K: H. Yet againe, once more; Cliff: Sir William Stanlie is your secret enemy, And if time fit, will openly professe it. K. H. Sir William Stanlie? Who? Sir William Stanlie My Chamberlaine, my Counsellor, the loue, The pleasure of my Court, my bosome friend, The Charge, and the Controulement of my person: The keyes and secrets of my treasurie; The all of all I am: I am vnhappie: Miserie of confidence,—let mee turne traytor To mine owne person, yeeld my Scepter vp To Edwards Sister, and her bastard Duke! Dur. You loose your constant temper. K. H. Sir William Stanlie! Oh doe not blame mee; hee, twas onely hee Who having rescu'd mee in Bosworth field From Richards bloudy sword, snatch'd from his head The Kingly Crowne, and plac'd it first on mine. Hee never fail'd mee; what haue I deserv'd To loose this good mans heart, or hee, his owne? Vrs: The night doth waste, this passion ill becomes yee; Provide against your danger. K. H. Let it be so. Vrswick command streight Stanly to his chamber. Tis well wee are ith Tower; set a guard on him; Clifford to bed; you must lodge here to night, Weel talke with you to morrow: my sad soule Devines strange troubles. Dawb: Ho, the King, the King, I must haue entrance. K. H. Dawbneys voyce; admit him. What new combustions huddle next to keepe Our eyes from rest?—the newes? Enter Dawbney. Daw: Ten thousand Cornish grudging to pay your Subsidies, haue gatherd a head, led by a Blacksmith, and a Lawyer, they make for London, And to them is joyn'd Lord Audlie, as they march, Their number daily encreases, they are— K. H. Rascalls—talke no more; Such are not worthie of my thoughts to night: And if I cannot sleepe, Ile wake:—to bed. When Counsailes faile, and theres in man no trust, Even then, an arme from heaven, fights for the just. Exeunt. Finis Actus primi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus Scæna prima. Enter aboue: Countesse of Crawford, Katherine, Iane, with other Ladies. Coun. Come Ladies, heeres a solemne preparation For entertainment of this English Prince; The King intends grace more then ordinarie, Twere pittie now, if a' should proue a Counterfeit. Kat: Blesse the young man, our Nation would be laughd at For honest soules through Christendome: my father Hath a weake stomacke to the businesse (Madam) But that the King must not be crost. Coun: A'brings A goodly troope (they say) of gallants with him; But very modest people, for they strive not To fame their names too much; their god-fathers May be beholding to them, but their fathers Scarce owe them thankes: they are disguised Princes, Brought vp it seemes to honest trades; no matter; They will breake forth in season. Iane. Or breake out. For most of em are broken by report;—The King, Kat. Let vs obserue 'em and be silent. Flourish. Enter King Iames, Huntley, Crawford, and Daliell. K. I. The right of Kings (my Lords) extends not onely To the safe Conservation of their owne; But also to the ayde of such Allies As change of time, and state, hath often times Hurld downe from carefull Crownes, to vndergoe An exercise of sufferance in both fortunes: So English Richard surnam'd Cor-de-lyon, So Robert Bruce our royall Ancestor, Forc'd by the tryall of the wrongs they felt, Both sought, and found supplyes, from forraigne Kings To repossesse their owne: then grudge not (Lords) A much distressed Prince, King Charles of Fraunce, And Maximilian of Bohemia both, Haue ratified his Credit by their Letters. Shall wee then be distrustfull? No, Compassion Is one rich Iewell that shines in our Crowne, And we will haue it shine there. Hunt. Doe your will Sir. K. I. The young Duke is at hand, Daliell from vs First greete him, and conduct him on; then Crawford Shall meete him next, and Huntley last of all Present him to our armes; sound sprightly Musique, Whilst Majestie encounters Majestie. Hoboyes. Daliell goes out, brings in Perkin at the doore where Crawford entertaines him, and from Crawford, Huntley salutes him, and presents him to the King: they embrace, Perkin in state retires some few paces backe: During which Ceremony, the Noblemen slightly salute Fryon, Heron a Mercer, Sketon a Taylor, Astley a Scrivenor, with Iohn a Watring, all Perkins followers. Salutations ended: cease Musique. War: Most high, most mightie King! that now there stands Before your eyes, in presence of your Peeres, A subject of the rarest kinde of pittie That hath in any age touchd noble hearts, The vulgar storie of a Princes ruine, Hath made it too apparent: Evrope knowes, And all the Westerne World what persecution Hath ragd in malice, against Vs, sole heire To the great throne, of old Plantaginetts. How from our Nursery, wee haue beene hurried Vnto the Sanctuarie, from the Sanctuarie Forc'd to the Prison, from the Prison hald By cruell hands, to the tormentors furie; Is registred alreadie in the Volume Of all mens tongues, whose true relation drawes Compassion, melted into weeping eyes, And bleeding soules: but our misfortunes since, Haue rang'd a larger progresse through strange Lands, Protected in our Innocence by Heaven. Edward the Fift our brother, in his Tragedie Quenchd their hot thirst of bloud, whose hire to murther Paid them their wages, of despaire and horrour; The softnesse of my childe-hood smild vpon The roughnesse of their taske, and rob'd them farther Of hearts to dare, or hands to execute. Great King they spard my life, the butchers spard it; Returnd the tyrant, my vnnaturall Vncle, A truth of my dispatch; I was conveyd With secresie and speede to Tournay; fosterd By obscure meanes, taught to vnlearne my selfe: But as I grew in yeares, I grew in sence Of feare, and of disdaine; feare, of the tyrant Whose power swaide the throne then, when disdaine Of living so vnknowne, in such a servile And abject lownesse, prompted mee to thoughts Of recollecting who I was; I shooke off My bondage, and made hast to let my Aunt Of Burgundie acknowledge mee her kinsman; Heire to the Crowne of England, snatch'd by Henry From Richards head; a thing scarce knowne ith world. K. I. My Lord, it stands not with your Counsaile now To flie vpon invectiues, if you can Make this apparent what you haue discourst In every Circumstance, wee will not studie An answer, but are ready in your Cause. War: You are a wise, and just King, by the powers Aboue, reserv'd beyond all other aydes To plant mee in mine owne inheritance: To marrie these two Kingdomes in a loue Never to be divor'd, while time is time. As for the manner first of my escape, Of my Conveyance, next, of my life since, The meanes, and persons, who were instruments; Great Sir, tis fit I over-passe in silence: Reserving the relation, to the secrecy Of your owne Princely eare, since it concernes Some great Ones living yet, and others dead, Whose issue might be question'd. For your bountie, Royall magnificence to him that seekes it, Wee vow hereafter, to demeane our selfe, As if wee were your owne, and naturall brother: Omitting no occasion in our person, To expresse a gratitude, beyond example. K. I. Hee must bee more then subject, who can vtter The language of a King, and such is thine. Take this for answer, bee what ere thou art, Thou never shalt repent that thou hast put Thy cause, and person, into my protection. Cosen of Yorke, thus once more Wee embrace thee; Welcome to Iames of Scotland, for thy safetie, Know such as loue thee not, shall never wrong thee. Come, wee will taste a while our Court delights, Dreame hence afflictions past, and then proceede To high attempts of honor, on, leade on; Both thou and thine are ours, and wee will guard yee. Leade on.— Exeunt, Manent Ladies aboue. Coun: I haue not seene a Gentleman Of a more braue aspect, or goodlier carriage; His fortunes moue not him—Madam, yare passionate. Kat: Beshrew mee, but his words haue touchd mee home, As if his cause concernd mee; I should pittie him If a' should proue another then hee seemes. Enter Crawford. Craw. Ladies the King commands your presence instantly, For entertainment of the Duke. Kat. The Duke Must then be entertain'd, the King obayd: It is our dutie. Coun: Wee will all waite on him. Exeunt. Flourish. Enter King Henry: Oxford; Durham; Surrey. K: H: Haue yee condem'd my Chamberlaine? Dur. His treasons condem'd him (Sir,) which were as Cleere and manifest, as foule and dangerous: Besides the guilt of his conspiracie prest him So neerely, that it drew from him free Confession without an importunitie. K: H: Oh Lord Bishop, This argued shame, and sorrow for his follie; And must not stand in evidence against Our mercie, and the softnesse of our nature; The rigor and extremitie of Law Is sometimes too too bitter, but wee carry A Chancerie of pittie in our bosome. I hope wee may repreiue him from the sentence Of death; I hope, we may. Dur: You may, you may; And so perswade your Subjects, that the title Of Yorke is better, nay, more just, and lawfull, Then yours of Lancaster; so Stanlie houlds: Which if it be not treason in the highest, Then we are traytors all; perjurd and false, Who haue tooke oath to Henry, and the justice Of Henries title; Oxford, Surrey, Dawbney, With all your other Peeres of State, and Church, Forsworne, and Stanlie true alone to Heaven, And Englands lawfull heire. Ox: By Veres old honors, Ile cut his throate dares speake it. Sur: Tis a quarrell To' ingage a soule in. K: H: What a coyle is here, To keepe my gratitude sincere and perfect? Stanlie was once my friend, and came in time To saue my life; yet to say truth (my Lords,) The man staid long enough t'indanger it: But I could see no more into his heart, Then what his outward actions did present; And for 'em haue rewarded 'em so fullie, As that there wanted nothing in our guift To gratifie his merit, as I thought, Vnlesse I should devide my Crowne with him, And giue him halfe; tho now I well perceiue Twould scarce haue seru'd his turne, without the whole. But I am Charitable (Lords) let Iustice Proceede in execution, whiles I mourne The losse of one, whom I esteemd a friend. Dur: Sir, he is comming this way. K: H: If a'speake to me, I could denie him nothing; to prevent it, I must withdraw, pray (Lords) commend my favours To his last peace, which I with him, will pray for: That done, it doth concerne vs, to consult Of other following troubles. Exeunt. Ox: I am glad hee's gone, vpon my life he would Haue pardon'd the Traytor, had a'seene him. Sur: 'Tis a King composd of gentlenesse. Dur: Rare, and vnheard of; But every man is neerest to himselfe, And that the King obserues, tis fit a' should. Enter Stanly; Executioner: Vrswick and Dawbney. Stan: May I not speake with Clifford ere I shake This peice of Frailtie off? Dawb: You shall, hees sent for. Stan: I must not see the King? Dur: From him Sir William These Lords and I am sent, hee bad vs say That he commends his mercy to your thoughts; Wishing the Lawes of England could remit The forfeit of your life, as willingly As he would in the sweetnesse of his nature, Forget your trespasse; but how ere your body Fall into dust, Hee vowes, the King himselfe Doth vow, to keepe a requiem for your soule, As for a friend, close treasur'd in his bosome. Ox: Without remembrance of your errors past, I come to take my leaue, and wish you Heaven. Sur: And I, good Angells guard yee. Stan: Oh the King Next to my soule, shall be the neerest subject Of my last prayers; my graue Lord of Durham, My Lords of Oxford, Surrey, Dawbney, all, Accept from a poore dying man, a farewell. I was as you are once, great, and stood hopefull Of many flourishing yeares, but fate, and time Haue wheeld about, to turne mee into nothing. Enter Clifford. Daw: Sir Robert Clifford comes, the man (Sir William) You so desire to speake with. Dur: Marke their meeting. Cliff: Sir William Stanlie, I am glad your Conscience Before your end, hath emptied every burthen Which charg'd it, as that you can cleerely witnesse, How farre I haue proceeded in a dutie That both concern'd my truth, and the States safetie. Stan: Mercy, how deare is life to such as hugge it? Come hether—by this token thinke on mee— Makes a Crosse on Cliffords face with his finger. Cliff: This token? What? I am abusd? Stan: You are not. I wett vpon your cheekes a holy Signe, The Crosse, the Christians badge, the Traytors infamie: Weare Clifford to thy graue this painted Emblem: Water shall never wash it off, all eyes That gaze vpon thy face, shall reade there written, A State-Informers Character, more vglie Stamp'd on a noble name, then on a base. The Heavens forgiue thee; pray (my Lords) no change Of words: this man and I haue vse too manie. Cliff: Shall I be disgrac'd without replie? Dur. Giue loosers Leaue to talke; his losse is irrecoverable. Stan: Once more To all a long farewell; the best of greatnesse Preserue the King; my next suite is (my Lords) To be remembred to my noble Brother, Darby my much griev'd brother; Oh! perswade him, That I shall stand no blemish to his house, In Chronicles writ in another age. My heart doth bleede for him; and for his sighes, Tell him, hee must not thinke, the stile of Darby, Nor being husband to King Henries Mother, The league with Peeres, the smiles of Fortune, can Secure his peace, aboue the state of man: I take my leaue, to travaile to my dust, “Subjects deserue their deaths whose Kings are just. Come Confessor, on with thy Axe (friend) on. Exeunt. Cliff: Was I call'd hither by a Traytors breath To be vpbraided? Lords, the King shall know it. Enter King Henry with a white staffe. K: H: The King doth know it Sir; the King hath heard What he or you could say; Wee haue given credit To every point of Cliffords information, The onely evidence 'gainst Stanlies head. A' dyes fort, are you pleasd? Cliff: I pleasd my Lord! K: H: No ecchoes: for your service, wee dismisse Your more attendance on the Court; take ease And liue at home; but as you loue your life, Stirre not from London without leaue from vs. Weele thinke on your reward, away. Cliff: I goe Sir. Exit Clifford. K: H: Dye all our griefes with Stanlie; take this staffe Of office Dawbney, henceforth be our Chamberlaine. Dawb: I am your humblest servant. K: H: Wee are followed By enemies at home, that will not cease To seeke their owne confusion; 'tis most true, The Cornish vnder Awdley are marcht on As farre as Winchester; but let them come, Our forces are in readinesse, weele catch 'em In their owne toyles. Dawb: Your Armie, being mustred, Consist in all, of horse and foote, at least In number six and twentie thousand; men Daring, and able, resolute to fight, And loyall in their truthes. K: H: Wee know it Dawbney: For them, wee order thus, Oxford in chiefe Assisted by bolde Essex, and the Earle Of Suffolke, shall leade on the first Battalia: Be that your charge. Ox: I humbly thanke your Majestie. K: H: The next Devision wee assigne to Dawbney: These must be men of action, for on those The fortune of our fortunes, must relie. The last and mayne, ourselfe commands in person, As readie to restore the fight at all times, As to consummate an assured victorie. Dawb: The King is still oraculous. K: H: But Surrey, Wee haue imployment of more toyle for thee! For our intelligence comes swiftly to vs, That Iames of Scotland, late hath entertaind Perkin the counterfeite, with more then common Grace and respect; nay courts him with rare favours; The Scot is young and forward, wee must looke for A suddaine storme to England from the North: Which to withstand, Durham shall post to Norham, To fortifie the Castle, and secure The frontiers, against an Invasion there. Surrey shall follow soone, with such an Armie, As may relieue the Bishop, and incounter On all occasions, the death-daring Scotts. You know your charges all, 'tis now a time To execute, not talke, Heaven is our guard still. Warre must breede peace, such is the fate of Kings. Exeunt. Enter Crawford and Daliell. Crawf: Tis more then strange, my reason cannot answere Such argument of fine Imposture, coucht In witch-craft of perswasion, that it fashions Impossibilities, as if appearance Could cozen truth it selfe; this Duk-ling Mushrome Hath doubtlesse charm'd the King. Daliell: A' courts the Ladies, As if his strength of language, chaynd attention By power of prerogatiue. Crawf: It madded My very soule, to heare our Maisters motion: What suretie both of amitie, and honor, Must of necessitie insue vpon A match betwixt some noble of our Nation, And this braue Prince forsooth. Dali: Twill proue to fatall, Wise Huntley feares the threatning. Blesse the Ladie From such a ruine. Cra: How the Connsaile privie Of this young Phueton, doe skrewe their faces Into a gravitie, their trades (good people) Were never guiltie of? the meanest of 'em Dreames of at least an office in the State. Dal: Sure not the Hangmans, tis bespoke alreadie For service to their rogueshippes—silence. Enter King Iames and Huntley. K: Iames, Doe not— Argue against our will; wee haue descended Somewhat (as wee may tearme it) too familiarly From Iustice of our birth-right, to examine The force of your alleagence:—Sir, wee haue; But finde it short of dutie! Hunt: Breake my heart, Doe, doe, King; haue my services, my loyaltie, (Heaven knowes vntainted ever) drawne vpon mee Contempt now in mine age? when I but wanted A minute of a peace not to be troubled? My last, my long one? Let me be a Dotard, A Bedlame, a poore sot, or what you please To haue me, so you will not staine your bloud, Your owne bloud (royall Sir) though mixt with mine, By marriage of this girle to a straggler! Take, take my head Sir, whilst my tongue can wagge It cannot name him other. K: Ia: Kings are counterfeits In your repute (graue Oracle) not presently Set on their thrones, with Scepters in their fists: But vse your owne detraction: tis our pleasure To giue our Cosen Yorke for wife our kinswoman The Ladie Katherine: Instinct of soveraigntie Designes the honor, though her peevish Father Vsurps our Resolution. Hunt: O tis well, Exceeding well, I never was ambitious Of vsing Congeys to my Daughter Queene: A Queene, perhaps a Queene?—Forgiue me Daliell Thou honorable Gentleman, none here Dare speake one word of Comfort? Dal: Cruell misery! Craw: The Lady gracious Prince, may be hath setled Affection on some former choyce. Dal: Inforcement, would proue but tyrannie. Hunt. I thanke 'ee heartily. Let any yeoman of our Nation challenge An interest in the girle: then the King May adde a Ioynture of ascent in titles, Worthy a free consent; now a'pulls downe What olde Desert hath builded. K. Ia. Cease perswasions, I violate no pawnes of faythes, intrude not On private loues; that I haue play'd the Orator For Kingly Yorke to vertuous Kate, her grant Can justifie, referring her contents To our provision, the Welch Harrie, henceforth Shall therefore know, and tremble to acknowledge, That not the paynted Idoll of his pollicie, Shall fright the lawfull owner from a Kingdome. Wee are resolv'd. Hunt. Some of thy Subjects hearts King Iames will bleede for this! K. Ia. Then shall their blouds Be nobly spent; no more disputes, hee is not Our friend who contradicts vs. Hunt. Farewell Daughter! My care by one is lessened; thanke the King for't, Enter. I and my griefes will daunce now,—Looke Lords looke, Heeres hand in hand alreadie? K. Ia. Peace olde phrensie. Enter Warbeck leading Katherine, complementing; Countesse of Crawford, Iane, Frion, Major of Corke, Astley, Heron and Sketon. How like a' King alookes? Lords, but obserue The confidence of his aspect? Drosse cannot Cleaue to so pure a mettall; royall youth! Plantaginett vndoubted! Hunt: Ho braue Lady! But no Plantagenet byr Lady yet By red Rose or by white. Warb. An Vnion this way, Settles possession in a Monarchie Establisht rightly, as is my inheritance: Acknowledge me but Soveraigne of this Kingdome, Your heart (fayre Princes) and the hand of providence, Shall crowne you Queene of me, and my best fortunes. Kath. Where my obedience is (my Lord) a dutie, Loue owes true service. Warb: Shall I?— K. Ia: Cossen yes, Enjoy her; from my hand accept your bride; And may they liue at emnitie with comfort, Who grieue at such an equall pledge of trothes. Y'are the Princes wife now. Kath: By your gift Sir; Warb: Thus I take seisure of mine owne. Kath: I misse yet A fathers blessing: Let me finde it;—humbly Vpon my knees I seeke it. Hunt: I am Huntley Olde Alexander Guerdon, a plaine subject, Nor more, nor lesse; and Ladie, if you wish for A blessing, you must bend your knees to Heaven; For Heaven did giue me you; alas, alas, What would you haue me say? may all the happinesse My prayers ever sued to fall vpon you, Preserue you in your vertues;—preethee Daliell Come with me; for, I feele thy griefes as full As mine, lets steale away, and cry together. Dal: My hopes are in their ruines. Exeunt Huntley and Daliell. K. Ia. Good kinde Huntley Is over-joy'd, a fit solemnitie, Shall perfite these delights: Crawford attend Our order for the preparation. Exeunt, manent, Frion, Major, Astley, Heron, &amp; Sketon. Fri: Now worthy Gentlemen, haue I not followed My vndertakings with successe? Heeres entrance Into a certaintie aboue a hope. Heron. Hopes are but hopes, I was ever confident, when I traded but in remnants, that my starres had reserv'd me to the title of a Viscount at least, honor is honor though cut out of any stuffes. Sket: My brother Heron, hath right wisely delivered his opinion: for he that threeds his needle with the sharpe eyes of industrie, shall in time goe through-stitch, with the new suite of preferment. Astley. Spoken to the purpose my fine witted brother Sketon, for as no Indenture, but has its counterpawne; no Noverint but his Condition, or Defeysance; so no right, but may haue claime, no claime but may haue possession, any act of Parlament to the Contrary notwithstanding. Frion. You are all read in mysteries of State, And quicke of apprehension, deepe in judgement, Actiue in resolution; and tis pittie Such counsaile should lye buryed in obscuritie. But why in such a time and cause of triumph, Stands the judicious Major of Corke so silent? Beleeue it Sir, as English Richard prospers, You must not misse imployment of high nature. Major. If men may be credited in their mortalitie, which I dare not peremptorily averre, but they may, or not be; presumptions by this marriage are then (in sooth) of fruitfull expectation. Or else I must not justifie other mens beliefe, more then other should relie on mine. Frion. Pith of experience, those that haue borne office, Weigh every word before it can drop from them; But noble Counsellers, since now the present, Requires in poynt of honor (pray mistake not) Some service to our Lord; 'tis fit the Scotts Should not ingrosse all glory to themselues, At this so grand, and eminent solemnitie. Sket: The Scotts? the motion is defied: I had rather, for my part, without tryall of my Countrie, suffer persecution vnder the pressing Iron of reproach: or let my skinne be pincht full of oylett holes, with the Bodkin of Derision. Ast: I will sooner loose both my eares on the Pillorie of Forgerie. Heron. Let me first liue a Banckrout, and die in the lowsee hole of hunger, without compounding for six pence in the pound. Major. If men faile not in their expectations, there may be spirits also that disgest no rude affronts (Master Secretarie Frion) or I am cozen'd: which is possible I graunt. Frion. Resolv'd like men of knowledge; at this feast then In honor of the Bride, the Scotts I know, Will in some shew, some maske, or some Devise, Preferre their duties: now it were vncomely, That wee be found lesse forward for our Prince, Then they are for their Ladie; and by how much Wee out-shine them in persons of account, By so much more will our indeavours meete with A liuelier applause. Great Emperours, Haue for their recreations vndertooke Such kinde of pastimes; as for the Conceite, Referre it to my studie; the performance You all shall share a thankes in, twill be gratefull. Heron. The motion is allowed, I haue stole to a dauncing Schoole when I was a Prentice. Astl: There haue beene Irish-Hubbubs, when I haue made one too. Sket: For fashioning of shapes, and cutting a crosse-caper, turne me off to my trade againe. Major. Surely, there is, if I be not deceived, a kinde of gravitie in merriment: as, there is, or perhaps ought to be, respect of persons in the qualitie of carriage, which is, as it is construed, either so, or so. Frion. Still you come home to me; vpon occasion I finde you rellish Courtship with discretion: And such are fit for Statesmen of your merits. Pray'e waite the Prince, and in his eare acquaint him With this Designe, Ile follow and direct ee'. O the toyle (Exeunt, mane Frion. Of humoring this abject scumme of mankinde?

Dawb: Briefly thus: The Cornish vnder Awdley disappoynted Of flattered expectation, from the Kentish (Your Majesties right trustie Liegemen) flewe, Featherd by rage, and hartned by presumption, To take the field, even at your Pallace gates, And face you in your chamber Royall; Arrogance, Improu'd their ignorance; for they supposing, (Misled by rumor) that the day of battaile Should fall on Munday, rather brav'd your forces Then doubted any onset; yet this Morning, When in the dawning I by your direction Stroue to get Dertford Strand bridge, there I found Such a resistance, as might shew what strength Could make; here Arrowes hayld in showers vpon vs A full yard long at least; but wee prevayld.

Hunt: Now Sir, a modest word with you (sad Gentleman) Is not this fine, I trowe, to see the gambolds, To heare the Iiggs, obserue the friskes, b'enchanted With the rare discord of bells, pipes and tabors, Hotchpotch of Scotch and Irish twingle twangles, Like to so many Queresters of Bedlam, Trowling a catch? the feasts, the manly stomaches, The healthes in Vsquabaugh, and bonie clabbore, The Ale in dishes never fetcht from China, The hundred thousand knackes not to be spoken of, And all this for King Oberon, and Queene Mab, Should put a soule int'ee: looke'ee (good man) How youthfull I am growne, but by your leaue, This new Queene Bride, must henceforth be no more My Daughter, no burladie, tis vnfit. And yet you see how I doe beare this change, Methinkes couragiously, then shake off care In such a time of jollitie. Dal. Alas Sir, How can you cast a mist vpon your griefes? Which how so ere you shadow, but present To any judging eye, the perfect substance Of which mine are but counterfeits. Hunt: Fo Daliel Thou interrupts the part I beare in Musicke To this rare bridall feast, let vs be merry; Whilst flattering calmes secure vs against stormes, Tempests when they begin to roare, put out The light of peace and cloud the Sunnes bright eye In darkenesse of despayre, yet wee are safe. Dal: I wish you could as easily forget The Iustice of your sorrowes, as my hopes Can yeelde to destinie. Hunt: Pish then I see Thou doest not know the flexible condition Of my ap't nature, I can laugh, laugh heartily When the Gowt crampes my joynts, let but the stone Stoppe in my bladder, I am streite a singing, The Quartane feaver shrinking every limme, Setts me a capring straite, doe but betray me And binde me a friend ever. what I trust The loosing of a Daughter, (though I doted On every hayre that grew to trim her head) Admitts not any paine like one of these. Come th'art deceivd in me, giue me a blow, A sound blow on the face, Ile thanke thee for't, I loue my wrongs, still th'art deceiv'd in me. Dal: Deceiu'd? Oh noble Huntley, my few yeares Haue learnt experience of too ripe an age To forfeite fit credulitie, forgiue My rudenesse, I am bolde. Hunt: Forgiue me first A madnesse of ambition, by example Teach me humilitie, for patience scornes, Lectures which Schoolemen vse to reade to boyes Vncapable of injuries; though olde I could grow tough in furie, and disclaime Alleagence to my King, could fall at odds With all my fellow Peeres, that durst not stand Defendants 'gainst the rape done on mine honor. But Kings are earthly gods, there is no medling With their annoynted bodies, for their actions, They onely are accountable to Heaven. Yet in the puzzle of my troubled braine One Antidote's reserv'd against the poyson Of my distractions, tis in thee t'apply it. Dal: Name it, oh name it quickly Sir! Hunt: A pardon For my most foolish sleighting thy Deserts, I haue culd out this time to beg it, preethee Be gentle, had I beene so, thou hadst own'd A happie Bride, but now a cast away, And never childe of mine more. Dal: Say not so (Sir,) it is not fault in her. Hunt: The world would prate How shee was handsome; young I know shee was, Tender, and sweet in her obedience; But lost now; what a banckrupt am I made Of a full stocke of blessings.—must I hope a mercy from thy heart? Dal: A loue, a service, A friendship to posteritie. Hunt: Good Angells Reward thy charitie, I haue no more But prayers left me now. Dal: Ile lend you mirth (Sir) If you will be in Consort. Hunt: Thanke yee' truely: I must, yes, yes, I must; heres yet some ease, A partner in affliction, looke not angry. Dal: Good noble Sir.

K: Ia: Good: the Proclamations readie; By that it will appeare, how the English stand Affected to your title; Huntley comfort Your Daughter in her Husbands absence; fight With prayers at home for vs, who for your honors, Must toyle in fight abroad. Hunt: Prayers are the weapons, Which men, so neere their graues as I, doe vse. I've little else to doe. K: Ia: To rest young beauties! Wee must be early stirring, quickly part, “A Kingdomes rescue craues both speede and art. Cosens good night. Flourish. Warb: Rest to our Cosen King. Kath: Your blessing Sir; Hunt: Faire blessings on your Highnesse, sure you neede'em. Exeunt omnes, Manent, Warb. &amp; Katherine. Warb: Iane set the lights downe, and from vs returne To those in the next roome, this little purse Say we'ele deserue their loues. Iane. It shall be done Sir. Warb: Now dearest; ere sweet sleepe shall seale those eyes, (Loues pretious tapers,) giue me leaue to vse A parting Ceremonie; for to morrowe, It would be sacriledge to intrude vpon The temple of thy peace: swift as the morning, Must I breake from the downe of thy embraces, To put on steele, and trace the pathes which leade Through various hazards to a carefull throne. Kath: My Lord, I would faine goe w'ee, theres small fortune In staying here behinde. Warb: The churlish browe Of warre (faire dearest) is a sight of horror For Ladies entertainment; if thou hear'st A truth of my sad ending by the hand Of some vnnaturall subject, thou withall Shalt heare, how I dyed worthie of my right, By falling like a King; and in the cloze Which my last breath shall sound, thy name, thou fayrest Shall sing a requiem to my soule, vnwilling Onely of greater glorie, 'cause devided From such a heaven on earth, as life with thee. But these are chimes for funeralls, my businesse Attends on fortune of a sprightlier triumph; For loue and Majestie are reconcil'd, And vow to crowne thee Empresse of the West. Kath: You haue a noble language (Sir,) your right In mee is without question, and however Events of time may shorten my deserts, In others pittie; yet it shall not stagger, Or constancie, or dutie in a wife. You must be King of me, and my poore heart Is all I can call mine. Warb: But we will liue; Liue (beauteous vertue) by the liuely test Of our owne bloud, to let the Counterfeite Be knowne the worlds contempt. Kath: Pray doe not vse That word, it carries fate in't; the first suite I ever made, I trust your loue will graunt! Warb: Without deniall (dearest.) Kath: That hereafter, If you returne with safetie, no adventure May sever vs in tasting any fortune: I nere can stay behinde againe. Warb: Y'are Ladie Of your desires, and shall commaund your will: Yet 'tis too hard a promise. Kath: What our Destinies Haue rul'd out in their Bookes, wee must not search But kneele too. Warb: Then to feare when hope is fruitlesse, Were to be desperately miserable; Which povertie, our greatnesse dares not dreame of, And much more scornes to stoope to; some fewe minutes Remaine yet, let's be thriftie in our hopes. Exeunt. Enter King Henrie, Hialas, and Vrswicke. K: H: Your name is Pedro Hialas: a Spaniard? Hialas. Sir a Castillian borne. K: H: King Ferdinand With wife Queene Isabell his royall consort, Write 'ee a man of worthie trust and candor. Princes are deare to heaven, who meete with Subjects Sincere in their imployments; such I finde Your commendation (Sir,) let me deliver How joyfull I repute the amitie, With your most fortunate Maister, who almost Comes neere a miracle, in his successe Against the Moores, who had devour'd his Countrie, Entire now to his Scepter; Wee, for our part Will imitate his providence, in hope Of partage in the vse o'nt; Wee repute The privacie of his advisement to vs By you, entended an Ambassadour To Scotland for a peace betweene our Kingdomes; A policie of loue, which well becomes His wisedome, and our care. Hialas. Your Majestie Doth vnderstand him rightly. K: H: Els, your knowledge can instruct me, wherein (Sir) To fall on Ceremonie, would seeme vselesse, Which shall not neede; for I will be as studious Of your concealement in our Conference, As any Counsell shall advise. Hialas. Then (Sir) My chiefe request is, that on notice given At my dispatch in Scotland, you will send Some learned man of power and experience To joyne in treatie with me. K. H. I shall doe it, Being that way well provided by a servant Which may attend 'ee ever. Hialas. If King Iames By any indirection should perceiue My comming neere your Court, I doubt the issue Of my imployment. K: H: Be not your owne Herald, I learne sometimes without a teacher. Hialas. Good dayes guard all your Princely thoughts. K: H: Vrswicke no further Then the next open Gallerie attend him. A heartie loue goe with you. Hialas. Your vow'd Beadsman. Ex: Vrsw: and Hialas. K: H: King Ferdinand is not so much a Foxe, But that a cunning Huntsman may in time Fall on the sent; in honourable actions Safe imitation best deserues a prayse. Enter Vrswicke. What' the Castillians past away? Vrsw: He is, And vndiscovered; the two hundred markes Your Majestie conveyde, a' gentlie purst, With a right modest gravitie. K: H: What wast A' mutterd in the earnest of his wisedome, A' spoke not to be heard? Twas about— Vrsw: Warbecke; How if King Henry were but sure of Subjects, Such a wilde runnagate might soone be cag'd, No great adoe withstanding. K: H: Nay, nay, something About my sonne Prince Arthurs match! Vrsw: Right, right, Sir. A humd it out, how that King Ferdinand Swore, that the marriage 'twixt the Ladie Katherine His Daughter, and the Prince of Wales your Sonne, Should never be consummated, as long As any Earle of Warwicke liv'd in England, Except by newe Creation. K: H: I remember, 'Twas so indeede, the King his Maister swore it? Vrsw: Directly, as he said. K: H: An Earle of Warwicke! Provide a Messenger for Letters instantly To Bishop Fox. Our newes from Scotland creepes, It comes so slow; wee must haue ayrie spirits: Our time requires dispatch,—the Earle of Warwicke! Let him be sonne to Clarence, younger brother To Edward! Edwards Daughter is I thinke Mother to our Prince Arthur; get a Messenger. Exeunt. Enter King Iames, Warbecke, Crawford, Daliell, Heron, Astley, Major, Sketon, and Souldiers. K: Ia: Wee trifle time against these Castle walls, The English Prelate will not yeelde, once more Giue him a Summons! Parley. Enter aboue Durham armed, a Truncheon in his hand, and Souldiers. Warb: See, the jolly Clarke Appeares trimd like a ruffian. K: Ia: Bishop, yet Set ope the portes, and to your lawfull Soveraigne Richard of Yorke surrender vp this Castle, And he will take thee to his Grace; else Tweede Shall overflow his banckes with English bloud, And wash the sande that cements those hard stones, From their foundation. Dur: Warlike King of Scotland, Vouchsafe a few words from a man inforc't To lay his Booke aside, and clap on Armes, Vnsutable to my age, or my profession. Couragious Prince, consider on what grounds, You rend the face of peace, and breake a League With a confederate King that courts your amitie; For whom too? for a vagabond, a straggler, Not noted in the world by birth or name, An obscure peasant, by the rage of Hell Loosd from his chaynes, to set great Kings at strife, What Nobleman? what common man of note? What ordinary subject hath come in, Since first you footed on our Territories, To onely faine a wellcome? children laugh at Your Proclamations, and the wiser pittie, So great a Potentates abuse, by one Who juggles meerly with the fawnes and youth Of an instructed complement; such spoyles, Such slaughters as the rapine of your Souldiers Alreadie haue committed, is enough To shew your zeale in a conceited Iustice. Yet (great King) wake not yet my Maisters vengeance: But shake that Viper off which gnawes your entrayles! I, and my fellow Subjects, are resolv'd If you persist, to stand your vtmost furie, Till our last bloud drop from vs. Warb: O Sir, lend Me eare to this seducer of my honor! What shall I call thee, (thou graybearded Scandall) That kickst against the Soveraigntie to which Thou owest alleagance? Treason is bold-fac'd, And eloquent in mischiefe; sacred King Be deafe to his knowne malice! Dur: Rather yeelde Vnto those holy motions, which inspire The sacred heart of an annoynted bodie! It is the surest pollicie in Princes, To governe well their owne, then seeke encroachment Vpon anothers right. Crawf: The King is serious, Deepe in his meditation. Dal: Lift them vp To heaven his better genius! Warb: Can you studie, while such a Devill raues? O Sir. K: Ia: Well,—Bishopp, You'le not be drawne to mercie? Dur: Conster me In like case by a Subject of your owne! My resolutions fixt, King Iames be counseld. A greater fate waites on thee. Exit Durham cum suis. K: Ia: Forrage through The Countrey, spare no prey of life, or goods, Warb: O Sir, then giue me leaue to yeeld to nature, I am most miserable; had I beene Borne what this Clergie man would by defame Baffle beliefe with, I had never sought The truth of mine inheritance with rapes Of women, or of infants murthered; Virgins Defloured; olde men butchered; dwellings fir'd; My Land depopulated; and my people Afflicted with a Kingdomes devastation. Shew more remorse great King, or I shall never Endure to see such havocke with drie eyes: Spare, spare, my deare deare England. K: Ia: You foole your pietie Ridiculously, carefull of an interest Another man possesseth! Wheres your faction? Shrewdly the Bishop ghost of your adherents, When not a pettie Burgesse of some Towne, No, not a Villager hath yet appear'd In your assistance, that should make 'ee whine, And not your Countryes sufferance as you tearme it. Dal: The King is angrie. Crawf: And the passionate Duke, Effeminately dolent. Warb: The experience In former tryalls (Sir) both of mine owne Or other Princes, cast out of their thrones, Haue so acquainted mee, how miserie Is destitute of friends, or of reliefe, That I can easily submit to taste Lowest reproofe, without contempt or words. Enter Frion. K: Ia: An humble minded man,—now, what intelligence Speakes Maister Secretarie Frion. Frion. Henrie Of England, hath in open field ore'throwne The Armies who opposd him, in the right Of this young Prince. K: Ia: His Subsidies you meane: more if you haue it? Frion. Howard Earle of Surrey, Backt by twelue Earles and Barons of the North, An hundred Knights and Gentlemen of Name, And twentie thousand Souldiers, is at hand To raise your siege. Brooke with a goodly Navie Is Admirall at Sea: and Dawbney followes With an vnbroken Armie for a second. Warb: 'Tis false! they come to side with vs. K: Ia: Retreate: Wee shall not finde them stones and walls to cope with. Yet Duke of Yorke, (for such thou sayest thou art,) Ile trie thy fortune to the height; to Surrey By Marchmount, I will send a braue Defiance For single Combate; once a King will venter His person to an Earle; with Condition Of spilling lesser bloud, Surrey is bolde And Iames resolv'd. Warb: O rather (gracious Sir,) Create me to this glorie; since my cause Doth interest this fayre quarrell; valued least I am his equall. K: I: I will be the man; March softly off, where Victorie can reape “A harvest crown'd with triumph, toyle is cheape. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus Scæna prima. Enter Surrey, Durham, Souldiers, with Drummes and Collors. Surrey: Are all our braving enemies shrunke backe? Hid in the fogges of their distempered climate, Not daring to behold our Colours wave In spight of this infected ayre? Can they Looke on the strength of Cundrestine defac't? The glorie of Heydonball devasted? that Of Edington cast downe? the pile of Fulden Orethrowne? And this the strongest of their Forts Olde Ayton Castle yeelded, and demolished? And yet not peepe abroad? the Scots are bold, Hardie in battayle, but it seemes the cause They vndertake considered, appeares Vnjoynted in the frame ont. Dur: Noble Surrey, Our Royall Masters wisedome is at all times His fortunes Harbinger; for when he drawes His sword to threaten warre, his providence Settles on peace, the crowning of an Empire. (Trumpet. Sur: Rancke all in order, 'tis a Heralds sound, Some message from King Iames, keepe a fixt station. Enter March-mount, and another Herald in their Coates. March: From Scotlands awfull Majestie, wee come Vnto the English Generall; Surrey. To me? Say on. March: Thus then; the wast and prodigall Effusion of so much guiltlesse bloud, As in two potent Armies, of necessitie Must glut the earths drie wombe, his sweet compassion Hath studied to prevent; for which to thee Great Earle of Surrey, in a single fight He offers his owne royall person; fayrely Proposing these conditions onely, that, If Victorie conclude our Masters right; The Earle shall deliver for his ransome The towne of Barwicke to him, with the Fishgarths. If Surrey shall prevaile; the King will paie A thousand pounds downe present for his freedome, And silence further Armes; so speakes King Iames. Surr: So speakes King Iames; so like a King a' speakes. Heralds, the English Generall returnes, A sensible Devotion from his heart, His very soule, to this vnfellowed grace. For let the King know (gentle Haralds) truely How his descent from his great throne, to honor A stranger subject with so high a title As his Compeere in Armes, hath conquered more Then any sword could doe: for which (my loyaltie Respected) I will serue his vertues ever In all humilitie: but Barwicke say Is none of mine to part with: In affayres “Of Princes, Subjects cannot trafficke rights “Inherent to the Crowne. My life is mine, That I dare freely hazard; and (with pardon To some vnbrib'd vaine-glorie) if his Majestie Shall taste a chaunge of fate, his libertie Shall meete no Articles. If I fall, falling So brauely, I referre me to his pleasure Without condition; and for this deare favour, Say (if not countermaunded) I will cease Hostilitie, vnlesse provokt. March: This answere Wee shall relate vnpartially. Durh: With favour, Pray haue a little patience—Sir, you finde By these gay-flourishes, how wearied travayle Inclines to willing rest; heeres but a Prologue However confidently vtterd, meant For some ensuing Acts of peace: consider The time of yeare, vnseasonablenesse of weather, Charge, barrennesse of profite, and occasion Presents it selfe for honorable treatie, Which wee may make good vse of; I will backe As sent from you, in poynt of noble gratitude Vnto King Iames with these his Heralds; you Shall shortlie heare from me (my Lord) for order Of breathing or proceeding; and King Henrie (Doubt not) will thanke the service. Surr: To your wisedome Lord Bishop I referre it. Durh: Be it so then. Surr: Haralds, accept this chaine, and these few Crownes March: Our Dutie Noble Generall. Dur. In part Of retribution for such Princely loue, My Lord the Generall is pleasd to shew The King your Maister, his sincerest zeale By further treatie, by no common man; I will my selfe returne with you. Sur: Y'obliege My faithfullest affections t'ee (Lord Bishop.) March: All happinesse attend your Lordship. Surr: Come friends, And fellow-Souldiers, wee I doubt shall meete No enemies, but woods and hills to fight with: Then twere as good to feede, and sleepe at home, Wee may be free from daunger, not secure. Exeunt omnes. Enter Warbeck and Frion. Warb: Frion, ô Frion! all my hopes of glorie Are at a stand! the Scottish King growes dull, Frostie and wayward, since this Spanish Agent Hath mixt Discourses with him; they are private, I am not cald to counsaile now; confusion On all his craftie shrugges; I feele the fabricke Of my designes are tottering. Frion. Henries pollicies Stirre with too many engins. Warb: Let his mines, Shapt in the bowells of the earth, blow vp Workes raisd for my defence, yet can they never Tosse into ayre the freedome of my birth, Or disavow my bloud, Plantaginetts! I am my Fathers sonne still; but ô Frion, When I bring into count with my Disasters, My Wifes compartnership, my Kates, my lifes; Then, then, my frailtie feeles an earth-quake; mischiefe Damb Henries plotts, I will be Englands King, Or let my Aunt of Burgundie report My fall in the attempt, deserv'd our Auncestors? Frion. You grow too wilde in passion, if you will Appeare a Prince indeede, confine your will To moderation. Warb: What a saucie rudenesse Prompts this distrust? If, if I will appeare? Appeare, a Prince? Death throttle such deceites Even in their birth of vtterance; cursed cozenage Of trust? Y'ee make me mad, twere best (it seemes) That I should turne Imposter to my selfe, Be mine owne counterfeite, belie the truth Of my deare mothers wombe, the sacred bed Of a Prince murthered, and a living baffeld! Frion. Nay, if you haue no eares to heare, I haue No breath to spend in vaine. Warb. Sir, sir, take heede! Golde, and the promise of promotion, rarely Fayle in temptation. Frion. Why to me this? Warb. Nothing Speake what you will; wee are not suncke so low But your advise, may peece againe the heart Which many cares haue broken: you were wont In all extremities to talke of comfort: Haue yee' none left now? Ile not interrupt yee'. Good, beare with my distractions! if King Iames Denie vs dwelling here, next whither must I? I preethee' be not angrie. Frion. Sir, I tolde yee' Of Letters come from Ireland, how the Cornish Stomacke their last defeate, and humblie sue That with such forces, as you could partake, You would in person land in Cornwall, where Thousands will entertaine your title gladly. Warb: Let me embrace thee, hugge thee! th'ast reviud My comforts, if my cosen King will fayle, Our cause will never, welcome my tride friends. Enter Major, Heron, Astley, Sketon. You keepe your braines awake in our defence: Frion, advise with them of these affaires, In which be wondrous secret; I will listen What else concernes vs here, be quicke and warie. Ex: Warbeck. Astl: Ah sweet young Prince? Secretarie, my fellow Counsellers and I, haue consulted, and jumpe all in one opinion directly, that if this Scotch garboyles doe not fadge to our mindes, wee will pell mell runne amongst the Cornish Chaughes presently, and in a trice. Sket: 'Tis but going to Sea, and leaping ashore, cut tenne or twelue thousand vnnecessary throats, fire seaven or eight townes, take halfe a dozen Cities, get into the Market place, crowne him Richard the Fovrth, and the businesse is finisht. Major. I graunt yee', quoth I, so farre forth as men may doe, no more then men may doe; for it is good to consider, when consideration may be to the purpose, otherwise still you shall pardon me: Little sayd is soone amended. Frion. Then you conclude the Cornish Action surest? Heron. Wee doe so. And doubt not but to thriue abundantly: Ho (my Masters) had wee knowne of the Commotion when wee set sayle out of Ireland, the Land had beene ours ere this time. Sket: Pish, pish, 'tis but forbearing being an Earle or a Duke a moneth or two longer; I say, and say it agen, if the worke goe not on apace, let me never see new fashion more, I warrant yee', I warrant yee', wee will haue it so, and so it shall be. Ast: This is but a cold phlegmaticke Countrie, not stirring enough for men of spirit, giue mee the heart of England for my money. Ske: A man may batten there in a weeke onely with hot loaues and butter, and a lustie cup of Muscadine and Sugar at breakfast, though he make never a meale all the moneth after. Major. Surely, when I bore office, I found by experience, that to be much troublesome, was to be much wise and busie; I haue observed, how filching and bragging, has beene the best service in these last warres, and therefore conclude peremptorily on the Designe in England; If things and things may fall out; as who can tell what or how; but the end will shew it. Frion. Resolv'd like men of judgement, here to linger More time, is but to loose it; cheare the Prince, And hast him on to this; on this depends, Fame in successe, or glorie in our ends. Exeunt omnes. Enter King Iames, Durham, and Hialas on either side. Hialas. France, Spaine and Germanie combine a League Of amitie with England; nothing wants For setling peace through Christendome, but loue Betweene the British Monarchs, Iames, and Henrie. Dur: The English Merchants (Sir,) haue beene receiu'd With generall procession into Antwerpe; The Emperour confirmes the Combination. Hialas. The King of Spaine, resolues a marriage For Katherine his Daughter, with Prince Arthur. Dur. Fraunce court's this holy contract. Hial. What can hinder a quietnesse in England? Durh: But your suffrage To such a sillie creature (mightie Sir?) As is but in effect an apparition, A shaddow, a meere trifle? Hial. To this vnion The good of both the Church and Common-wealth Invite ee'— Dur. To this vnitie, a mysterie Of providence poynts out a greater blessing For both these Nations, then our humane reason Can search into; King Henrie hath a Daughter The Princess, Margaret; I neede not vrge, What honor, what felicitie can followe On such affinitie twixt two Christian Kings, In leagu'd by tyes of bloud; but sure I am, If you Sir ratifie the peace propos'd, I dare both motion, and effect this marriage For weale of both the Kingdomes. K: Ia. Darst thou Lord Bishop? Dur. Put it to tryall royall Iames, by sending Some noble personage to the English Court By way of Embassie. Hial. Part of the businesse, Shall suite my mediation. K. Ia. Well; what Heaven Hath poynted out to be, must be; you two Are Ministers (I hope) of blessed fate. But herein onely I will stand acquitted, No bloud of Innocents shall buy my peace. For Warbecke as you nicke him, came to me Commended by the States of Christendome. A Prince, though in distresse; his fayre demeanor, Louely behaviour, vnappalled spirit, Spoke him not base in bloud, how ever clouded. The bruite beasts haue both rockes and caues to flie to, And men the Altars of the Church; to vs He came for refuge, “Kings come neere in nature “Vnto the Gods in being toucht with pittie. Yet (noble friends) his mixture with our bloud, Even with our owne, shall no way interrupt A generall peace; onely I will dismisse him From my protection, throughout my Dominions In safetie, but not ever, to returne. Hialas. You are a just King. Durh. Wise, and herein happie. K. Ia. Nor will wee dallie in affayres of weight: Huntley (Lord Bishop) shall with you to England Embassador from vs; wee will throw downe Our weapons; peace on all sides now, repayre Vnto our Counsayle, wee will soone be with you. Hial. Delay shall question no dispatch, Heaven crowne it. Exeunt Durham and Hialas. K: Ia: A league with Ferdinand? a marriage With English Margaret? a free release From restitution for the late affronts? Cessation from hostilitie? and all For Warbeck not delivered, but dismist? Wee could not wish it better, Daliell— Dal: Here Sir. Enter Daliell. K: Ia: Are Huntley and his Daughter sent for? Dal: Sent for, and come (my Lord.) K: Ia: Say to the English Prince, Wee want his companie. Dal: He is at hand Sir. Enter Warbeck, Katherine, Iane, Frion, Heron, Sketon, Major, Astley. K. Ia. Cosen, our bountie, favours, gentlenesse, Our benefits, the hazard of our person, Our peoples liues, our Land hath evidenc't, How much wee haue engag'd on your behalfe: How triviall, and how dangerous our hopes Appeare, how fruitlesse our attempts in warre, How windie rather smokie your assurance Of partie shewes, wee might in vaine repeate! But now obedience to the Mother Church, A Fathers care vpon his Countryes weale, The dignitie of State directs our wisedome, To seale an oath of peace through Christendome: To which wee are sworne alreadie; 'tis you Must onely seeke new fortunes in the world, And finde an harbour elsewhere: as I promisd On your arrivall, you haue met no vsage Deserues repentance in your being here: But yet I must liue Master of mine owne. How ever, what is necessarie for you At your departure, I am well content You be accommodated with; provided Delay proue not my enemie. Warb. It shall not (Most glorious Prince.) the fame of my Designes, Soares higher, then report of ease and sloath Can ayme at; I acknowledge all your favours Boundlesse, and singular, am onely wretched In words as well as meanes, to thanke the grace That flow'd so liberallie. Two Empires firmely You're Lord of, Scotland, and Duke Richards heart. My claime to mine inheritance shall sooner Fayle, then my life to serue you, best of Kings. And witnesse Edvvards bloud in me, I am More loath to part, with such a great example Of vertue, then all other meere respects. But Sir my last suite is, you will not force From me what you haue given, this chast Ladie, Resolv'd on all extremes. Kath: I am your wife, No humane power, can or shall divorce My faith from dutie. Warb: Such another treasure The earth is Banckrout of. K: Ia: I gaue her (Cosen) And must avowe the guift: will adde withall A furniture becomming her high birth And vnsuspected constancie; provide For your attendance—wee will part good friends. Exit King and Daliell. Warb: The Tudor hath beene cunning in his plotts: His Fox of Durham would not fayle at last. But what? our cause and courage are our owne: Be men (my friends) and let our Cosen King, See how wee followe fate as willingly As malice followes vs. Y'are all resolv'd For the West parts of England? Omnes. Cornwall, Cornwall. Frion. The Inhabitants expect you daily. Warb: Chearefully Draw all our shippes out of the harbour (friends) Our time of slay doth seeme too long, wee must Prevent Intelligence; about it suddenly. Omnes. A Prince, a Prince, a Prince. Exeunt Counsellors. Warb: Dearest; admit not into thy pure thoughts The least of scruples, which may charge their softnesse With burden of distrust. Should I proue wanting To noblest courage now, here were the tryall: But I am perfect (sweete) I feare no change, More then thy being partner in my sufferance. Kath: My fortunes (Sir) haue armd me to encounter What chance so ere they meete with.—Iane 'tis fit Thou stay behinde, for whither wilt thou wander? Iane. Never till death, will I forsake my Mistresse, Nor then, in wishing to dye with ee' gladly. Kath: Alas good soule. Frion. Sir, to your Aunt of Burgundie I will relate your present vndertakings; From her expect on all occasions, welcome. You cannot finde me idle in your services. Warb: Goe, Frion, goe! wisemen knowe how to soothe Adversitie, not serue it: thou hast wayted Too long on expectation; “never yet “Was any Nation read of, so besotted “In reason, as to adore the setting Sunne. Flie to the Arch-Dukes Court; say to the Dutchesse, Her Nephewe, with fayre Katherine, his wife, Are on their expectation to beginne The raysing of an Empire. If they fayle, Yet the report will never: farewell Frion. Exit Frion. This man Kate ha's beene true, though now of late, I feare too much familiar with the Foxe. Enter Huntley and Daliell. Hunt: I come to take my leaue, you neede not doubt My interest in this sometime-childe of mine. Shees all yours now (good Sir) oh poore lost creature! Heaven guard thee with much patience, if thou canst Forget thy title to olde Huntleyes familie; As much of peace will settle in thy minde As thou canst wish to taste, (but in thy graue,) Accept my teares yet, (preethee) they are tokens Of charitie, as true as of affection. Kath: This is the cruelst farewell! Hunt: Loue (young Gentleman) This modell of my griefes; shee calls you husband; Then be not jealous of a parting kisse, It is a Fathers not a Lovers offring; Take it, my last,—I am too much a childe. Exchange of passion is to little vse, So I should grow to foolish,—goodnes guide thee. Exit Hunt. Kath: Most miserable Daughter!—haue you ought To adde (Sir) to our sorrowes? Daliell. I resolue (Fayre Ladie) with your leaue, to waite on all Your fortunes in my person, if your Lord Vouchsafe me entertainement. Warb: Wee will be bosome friends, (most noble Daliell) For I accept this tender of your loue Beyond abilitie of thankes to speake it. Cleere thy drownd eyes (my fayrest) time and industrie Will shew vs better dayes, or end the worst. Exeunt omnes. Enter Oxford and Dawbney. Oxf: No newes from Scotland yet (my Lord!) Daw: Not any But what King Henrie knowes himselfe; I thought Our Armies should haue marcht that way, his minde It seemes, is altered. Oxf: Victorie attends His Standard every where. Dawb: Wise Princes (Oxford) Fight not alone with forces. Providence Directs and tutors strength; else Elephants, And barbed Horses might as well prevaile, As the most subtile stratagems of warre. Oxf: The Scottish King shew'd more then common braverie, In proffer of a Combatt hand to hand With Surrey! Dawb: And but shew'd it; Northern blouds Are gallant being fir'd, but the cold climate Without good store of fuell, quickly freeseth The glowing flames. Oxf: Surrey vpon my life Would not haue shrunke an hayres breadth. Dawb: May a' forfeite The honor of an English name, and nature, Who would not haue embrac't it with a greedinesse, As violent as hunger runnes to foode. 'Twas an addition, any worthie Spirit Would covet next to immortalitie, Aboue all joyes of life: wee all mist shares In that great opportunitie. Enter King Henrie, and Vrswicke whispering. Oxf: The King: see a' comes smiling! Dawb: O the game runnes smooth On his side then beleeue it, Cards well shuffeld And dealt with cunning, bring some gamester thrift, But others must rise loosers. K: H: The trayne takes? Vrsw: Most prosperously. K. H. I knew it should not misse. He fondly angles who will hurle his bayte Into the water, 'cause the Fish at first Playes round about the line, and dares not bite. Lords, wee may reigne your King yet, Dawbney, Oxford, Vrwicke, must Perkin weare the Crowne? Dawb: A Slaue. Oxf: A Vagabond. Vrsw: A Glow-worme. K: H: Now if Frion, His practisd politician weare a brayne Of proofe, King Perkin will in progresse ride Through all his large Dominions; let vs meete him, And tender homage; Ha Sirs? Liegmen ought To pay their fealtie. Dawb: Would the Rascall were With all his rabble, within twentie miles Of London. K: H: Farther off is neere enough To lodge him in his home; Ile wager odds Surrey and all his men are either idle, Or hasting backe, they haue not worke (I doubt) To keepe them busie. Dawb: 'Tis a strange conceite Sir. K: H: Such voluntarie favours as our people In dutie ayde vs with, wee never scatter'd On Cobweb Parasites, or lavish't out In ryot, or a needlesse hospitalitie: No vndeserving favourite doth boast His issues from our treasury; our charge Flowes through all Europe, prooving vs but steward Of every contribution, which provides Against the creeping Cankar of Disturbance. Is it not rare then, in this toyle of State Wherein wee are imbarkt, with breach of sleepe, Cares, and the noyse of trouble, that our mercy. Returnes nor thankes, nor comfort? Still the West Murmure and threaten innovation, Whisper our government tyrannicall, Denie vs what is ours, nay, spurne their liues Of which they are but owners by our guift. It must not be. Oxf: It must not, should not. K: H: So then. To whom? Enter a Post. Post. This packett to your sacred Majestie. K: H: Sirra attend without. Oxf: Newes from the North, vpon my life. Daw. Wise Henry Devines aforehand of events: with him Attempts and execution are one act. K: H: Vrswicke thine eare; Frion is caught, the man Of cunning is out-reacht: wee must be safe: Should reverend Morton our Arch-bishop moue To a translation higher yet, I tell thee, My Durham ownes a brayne deserues that See. Hees nimble in his industrie, and mounting: Thou hear'st me? Vrsw: And conceiue your Highnesse fitly: K. H. Dawbney, and Oxford; since our Armie stands Entire, it were a weakenesse to admit The rust of lazinesse to eate amongst them: Set forward toward Salisburie; the playnes Are most commodious for their exercise. Our selfe will take a Muster of them there: And or disband them with reward, or else Dispose as best concernes vs. Dawb: Salisburie? Sir, all is peace at Salisburie. K: H: Deare friend— The change must be our owne; we would a little Pertake the pleasure with our Subjects ease. Shall I entreat your Loues? Oxf: command our Liues. K: H: Y'are men know how to doe, not to forethinke: My Bishop is a jewell try'd, and perfect; A jewell (Lords) the Post who brought these Letters, Must speed another to the Mayor of Exceter. Vrswicke dismisse him not. Vrs: He waites your pleasure. K: H: Perkin a King? a King? Vrs: My gracious Lord. K: H: Thoughts, busied in the spheare of Royaltie, Fixe not on creeping wormes, without their stings; Meere excrements of earth. The vse of time Is thriving safetie, and a wise prevention Of ills expected. W'are resolv'd for Salisburie. Exe: omnes. A generall shout within. Enter Warbeck, Daliell, Katherine, and Iane. Warb: After so many stormes as winde and Seas, Haue threatned to our weather-beaten Shippes, At last (sweet fayrest) wee are safe arriv'd On our deare mother earth, ingratefull onely To heaven and vs, in yeelding sustenance To slie Vsurpers of our throne and right. These generall acclamations, are an Omen Of happie processe to their welcome Lord: They flocke in troopes, and from all parts with wings Of dutie flie, to lay their hearts before vs. Vnequal'd patterne of a matchlesse wife, How fares my dearest yet? Kath: Confirm'd in health: By which I may the better vndergoe The roughest face of change; but I shall learne Patience to hope, since silence courts affliction For comforts, to this truely noble Gentleman; Rare vnexampled patterne of a friend? And my beloved Iane, the willing follower Of all misfortunes. Dal: Ladie, I returne But barren cropps, of early protestations, Frost-bitten in the spring of fruitlesse hopes. Iane, I waite but as the shaddow to the bodie, For Madam without you let me be nothing. Warb: None talke of sadnesse, wee are on the way Which leades to Victorie: keepe cowards thoughts With desperate sullennesse! the Lyon faints not Lockt in a grate, but loose, disdaines all force Which barres his prey; and wee are Lyon-hearted, Or else no King of beasts. Harke how they shout. (Another shout. Triumphant in our cause? bolde confidence Marches on brauely, cannot quake at daunger. Enter Sketon. Sket. Saue King Richard the fourth, saue thee King of hearts? the Cornish blades are men of mettall, haue proclaimed through Bodnam and the whole Countie, my sweete Prince Monarch of England, foure thousand tall yeomen, with bow and sword alreadie vow to liue and dye at the foote of King Richard. Enter Astley. Astley. The Mayor our fellow Counseller, is servant for an Emperour. Exceter is appointed for the Rend-a-vous, and nothing wants to victory but courage, and resolution. Nigillatum &amp; datum decimo Septembris, Anno Regui Regis primo &amp; cetera; confirmatum est. Al's cocke sure. Warb: To Exceter, to Exceter, march on. Commend vs to our people; wee in person Will lend them double spirits, tell them so. She: &amp; Astl: King Richard, King Richard. Warb. A thousand blessings guard our lawfull Armes! A thousand horrors peirce our enemies soules! Pale feare vnedge their weapons sharpest poynts, And when they draw their arrowes to the head, Numnesse shall strike their sinewes; such advantage Hath Majestie in its pursuite of Iustice, That on the proppers vp, of truths olde throne, It both enlightens counsell, and giues heart To execution: whiles the throates of traytors Lye bare before our mercie. O Divinitie Of royall birth? how it strikes dumbe the tongues Whose prodigallitie of breath is brib'd By traynes to greatnesse? Princes are but men, Distinguisht in the finenesse of their frailtie. Yet not so grosse in beautie of the minde, For there's a fire more sacred, purifies The drosse of mixture. Herein stands the odds “Subjects are men, on earth Kings men and gods. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus Scæna prima. Enter Katherine, and Iane, in riding suits, with one servant. Kath: It is decreede; and wee must yeeld to fate, Whose angry Iustice though it threaten ruine, Contempt, and povertie, is all but tryall Of a weake womans constancie in suffering. Here in a strangers, and an enemies Land Forsaken, and vnfurnisht of all hopes, (But such as waite on miserie,) I range To meete affliction where so ere I treade. My trayne, and pompe of servants, is reduc't To one kinde Gentlewoman, and this groome. Sweet Iane, now whither must wee? Iane. To your Shippes Deare Lady: and turne home. Kath: Home! I haue none. Flie thou to Scotland, thou hast friends will weepe For joy to bid thee welcome; but ô Iane My Iane, my friends are desperate of comfort As I must be of them; the common charitie, Good peoples almes, and prayers of the gentle Is the revenue must support my state. As for my natiue Countrey, since it once Saw me a Princesse in the height of greatnesse My birth allow'd me; here I make a vow, Scotland shall never see me, being fallen Or lessened in my fortunes. Never Iane; Never to Scotland more will I returne. Could I be Englands Queene (a glory Iane I never fawn'd on) yet the King who gaue me, Hath sent me with my husband from his presence: Deliver'd vs suspected to his Nation: Renderd vs spectacles to time, and pittie. And is it fit I should returne to such As onely listen after our descent From happinesse enjoyd, to misery Expected, though vncertaine? Never, never; Alas, why do'st thou weepe? and that poore creature, Wipe his wett cheekes too? let me feele alone Extremities, who know to giue them harbour: Nor thou, nor he, ha's cause. You may liue safely. Iane. There is no safetie whiles your dangers (Madam) Are every way apparent. Servant. Pardon Ladie; I cannot choose but shew my honest heart; You were ever my good Ladie. Kath: O deare soules! Your shares in griefe are too too much. Enter Daliell. Daliell. I bring (Fayre Princesse) newes of further sadnesse yet, Then your sweet youth, hath beene acquainted with. Kath: Not more (my Lord) then I can welcome; speake it; The worst, the worst, I looke for. Dal. All the Cornish, At Exceter, were by the Citizens Repulst, encountred by the Earle of Devonshire And other worthy Gentlemen of the Countrey. Your husband marcht to Taunton, and was there Affronted by King Henries Chamberlayne. The King himselfe in person, with his Armie Advancing neerer, to renew the fight On all occasions. But the night before The battayles were to joyne, your husband privately Accompanied with some few horse, departed From out the campe, and posted none knowes whither. Kath: Fled without battayle given? Dal: Fled, but follow'd By Dawbney, all his parties left to taste King Henries mercie, for to that they yeelded; Victorious without bloudshed. Kath: O my sorrowes! If both our liues had prou'd the sacrifice To Henries tyrannie, wee had fallen like Princes, And rob'd him, of the glory of his pride. Dal: Impute it not to faintnesse, or to weakenesse Of noble courage Ladie, but foresight: For by some secret friend he had intelligence Of being bought and solde, by his base followers. Worse yet remaines vntold. Kath: No, no, it cannot. Daliell. I feare y'are betray'd. The Earle of Oxford Runnes hot in your pursuite. Kath: A' shall not neede, Weele runne as hot in resolution, gladly To make the Earle our Iaylor. Iane. Madam, Madam, they come, they come! Enter Oxford, with followers. Daliell. Keepe backe, or he who dares Rudely to violate the Law of honor, Runnes on my sword. Kath: Most noble Sir, forbeare! What reason drawes you hither (Gentlemen!) Whom seeke 'ee? Oxf: All stand off; with favour Ladie From Henry, Englands King, I would present, Vnto the beauteous Princesse, Katherine Gourdon, The tender of a gracious entertainment. Kath: Wee are that Princesse, whom your maister King Pursues with reaching armes, to draw into His power: let him vse his tyrannie, Wee shall not bee his Subjects. Oxf: My Commission, extends no further (excellentest Ladie) Then to a service; 'tis King Henries pleasure, That you, and all, that haue relation t'ee, Be guarded as becomes your birth, and greatnesse. For rest assur'd (sweet Princesse) that not ought Of what you doe call yours, shall finde disturbance, Or any welcome other, then what suits Your high condition. Kath: By what title (Sir) May I acknowledge you? Oxf: Your servant (Ladie) Descended from the Line of Oxfords Earles, Inherits what his auncestors before him Were owners of. Kath: Your King is herein royall, That by a Peere so auncient in desert As well as bloud, commands Vs to his presence. Oxf: Invites 'ee, Princesse not commands. Kath: Pray vse Your owne phrase as you list; to your protection Both I, and mine submit. Oxf: There's in your number A Nobleman, whom fame hath brauely spoken. To him the King my Maister bad mee say How willingly he courts his friendship. Far From an enforcement, more then what in tearmes Of courtesie, so great a Prince may hope for. Daliell. My name is Daliell. Oxf: 'Tis a name, hath wonne Both thankes, and wonder, from report; (my Lord) The Court of England emulates your meritt, And covetts to embrace 'ee. Daliell. I must waite on The Princesse in her fortunes. Oxf: Will you please, (Great Ladie) to set forward? Kath: Being driven By fate, it were in vaine to striue with Heaven. Exeunt omnes. Enter King Henry, Surrey, Vrswicke, and a guard of Souldiers. K: H: The Counterfeit King Perkin is escap'd, Escape, so let him; he is heg'd too fast Within the Circuite of our English pale, To steale out of our Ports, or leape the walls Which guarde our Land; the Seas are rough, and wider Then his weake armes can tugge with; Surrey henceforth Your King may raigne in quiet: turmoyles past Like some vnquiet dreame, haue rather busied Our fansie, then affrighted rest of State. But Surrey, why in articling a peace With Iames of Scotland, was not restitution Of Losses, which our Subjects did sustaine By the Scotch inrodes, questioned? Sur: Both demanded And vrg'd (my Lord,) to which the King reply'd In modest merriment, but smiling earnest, How that our Master Henrie was much abler To beare the detriments, then he repay them. K: H: The young man I beleeue spake honest truth, 'A studies to be wise betimes. Ha's Vrswicke, Sir Rice ap Thomas, and Lord Brooke our Steward, Return'd the westerne Gentlemen full thankes, From Vs, for their try'd Loyalties? Sur: They haue: Which as if health and life had raign'd amongst eem', With open hearts, they joyfully receiu'd. K: H: Young Buckingham is a fayre natur'd Prince, Louely in hopes, and northie of his Father: Attended by an hundred Knights and Squires, Of speciall name, he tendred humble service, Which wee must n'ere forget: and Devonshires wounds Though sleight, shall find sound cure, in our respect. Enter Dawbney, with Warbeck, Heron, Iohn a Water, Astley, Sketon. Dawb: Life to the King, and safetie fixe his throne: I here present you (royall Sir) a shadowe Of Majestie, but in effect a substance Of pittie; a young man, in nothing growne To ripenesse, but th'ambition of your mercie: Perkin the Christian worlds strange wonder. K: H: Dawbney, Wee obserue no wonder; I behold (tis true) An ornament of nature, fine, and pollisht, A handsome youth indeede, but not admire him. How came he to thy hands? Dawb: From Sanctuarie At Beweley, neere Southhampton, registred With these few followers, for persons priviledg'd. K: H: I must not thanke you Sir! you were too blame To infringe the Libertie of houses sacred: Dare wee be irreligious? Dawb: Gracious Lord, They voluntarily resign'd themselues, Without compulsion. K: H: So? 'twas very well, T'was very very well—turne now thine eyes (Young man) vpon thy selfe, and thy past actions! What revells in combustion through our Kingdome, A frenzie of aspiring youth hath daunc'd, Till wanting breath, thy feete of pride haue slipt To breake thy necke. Warb: But not my heart; my heart Will mount, till every drop of bloud be frozen By deaths perpetuall Winter: If the Sunne Of Maiestie be darkned, let the Sunne Of Life be hid from mee, in an eclipse: Lasting, and vniversall. Sir, remember There was a shooting in of light, when Richmond (Not ayming at a crowne) retyr'd, and gladly, For comfort, to the Duke of Britaines Court. Richard who swayed the Scepter, was reputed A tyrant then; yet then, a dawning glimmer'd To some few wandring remnants, promising day When first they ventur'd, on a frightfull shore, At Milford Haven. Dawb: Whither speeds his boldnesse? Checke his rude tongue (great Sir!) K: H: O let him range: The player's on the stage still, 'tis his part; A' does but act: what followed? Warb: Bosworth feild: Where at an instant, to the worlds amazement, A morne to Richmond, and a night to Richard Appear'd at once: the tale is soone applyde: Fate which crown'd these attempts when lest assur'd, Might haue befriended others, like resolv'd. K: H: A prettie gallant! thus, your Aunt of Burgundie, Your Dutchesse Aunt enform'd her Nephew; so The lesson prompted, and well conn'd, was moulded Into familiar Dialogue, oft rehearsed, Till learnt by heart, 'tis now, receiv'd for truth. Warb: Truth in her pure simplicitie wants art To put a fayned blush on: scorne weares onely Such fashion, as commends to gazers eyes Sad vlcerated Noveltie; farre beneath The spheare of Maiestie: in such a Court, Wisedome, and gravitie, are proper robes, By which the Soveraigne is best distinguisht', From Zanyes to his Greatnesse. K: H: Sirra, shift Your anticke Pageantrie, and now appeare In your owne nature, or y'oule taste the daunger Of fooling out of season. Warb: I expect No lesse, then what severitie calls Iustice, And Polititians, safetie; let such begge, As feed on almes: but if there can be mercie In a protested enemie, then may it Descend to these poore creatures, whose engagements To th'bettering of their fortunes, haue incur'd A losse of all; to them, if any charitie Flowe from some noble Orator, in death I owe the fee of thankfulnesse. K: H: So braue! What a bold knaue is this? which of these Rebells Ha's beene the Mayor of Corke? Dawb: This wise formalitie: Kneele to the King 'ee Rascalls! K: H: Canst thou hope, A Pardon, where thy guilt is so apparant? Mayor. Vnder your good favours, as men, are men, they may erre: for I confesse, respectiuely, in taking great parts, the one side prevailing, the other side must goe downe: herein the poynt is cleere, if the proverbe hold, that hanging goes by destinie, that it is to little purpose to say, this thing, or that, shall be thus, or thus; for as the fates will haue it, so it must be, and who can helpe it. Dawb: O block-head! thou a privie Counseller? Begg life, and cry aloude, Heaven saue King Henrie. Mayor. Every man knowes what is best, as it happens: for my owne part, I beleeue it is true, if I be not deceived, that Kings must be Kings, and Subjects, Subjects. But which is which; you shall pardon me for that; whether we speake or hold our peace, all are mortall, no man knowes his end. K: H: Wee trifle time with follyes. Omnes. Mercie, mercie. K: H: Vrswicke, command the Dukeling, and these fellowes, To Digby, the Lieftenant of the Tower: With safetie let them be convay'd to London. It is our pleasure, no vncivill outrage, Taunts, or abuse be suffred to their persons; They shall meete fayrer Law then they deserue. Time may restore their wits, whom vaine ambition Hath many yeares distracted. Warb: Noble thoughts Meete freedome in captivitie; the Tower? Our Childhoods dreadfull nursery. K: H: No more. Vrs: Come, come, you shall haue leisure to bethinke 'ee. Exit Vrsw: with Perkin and his. K: H: Was ever so much impudence in forgery? The custome sure of being stil'd a King, Hath fastend in his thought that He Is Svch. But wee shall teach the ladd, another language; 'Tis good we haue him fast. Dawb: The Hangmans physicke Will purge this saucie humor. K: H: Very likely: Yet, wee could, temper mercie, with extremitie, Being not too far provok'd. Enter Oxford, Katherine in her richest attyre, Iane, and attendants. Oxf: Great Sir, be pleas'd With your accustomed grace, to entertaine The Princesse Katherine Gourdon. K. H: Oxford, herein Wee must beshrew thy knowledge of our nature. A Ladie of her birth and vertues, could not Haue found Vs so vnfurnisht of good manners, As not on notice given, to haue mett her Halfe way in poynt of Loue. Excuse (fayre Cosen) The oversight! ô fye, you may not kneele: 'Tis most vnfitting; first, vouchsafe this welcome; A welcome to your owne, for you shall finde Vs But guardian to your fortune, and your honours. Kath: My fortunes, and mine honors, are weake champions, As both are now befriended (Sir!) however Both bow before your clemencie. K: H: Our armes Shall circle them from malice—'A sweete Ladie? Beautie incomparable? Here liues Majestie At league with Loue. Kath: O Sir, I haue a husband. K: H: Wee'le proue your father, husband, friend, and servant, Proue what you wish to graunt vs, (Lords) be carefull A Pattent presently be drawne, for issuing A thousand pounds from our Exchequer yearely, During our Cosens life: our Queene shall be Your chiefe companion, our owne Court your Home, Our Subjects, all your servants. Kath: But my husband? K: H: By all descriptions, you are noble Daliell, Whose generous truth hath fam'd a rare observance! Wee thanke 'ee, 'tis a goodnesse giues addition To every title, boasted from your Auncestrie, In all most worthy. Daliell. Worthier then your prayses, Right princely Sir, I neede not glorie in. K: H: Embrace him (Lords,) who ever calls you Mistresse Is lifted in our charge,—a goodlier beautie Mine eyes yet neere incountred. Kath: Cruell misery Of fate, what rests to hope for? K: H: Forward Lords To London: (fayre) ere long, I shall present 'ee With a glad object, peace, and Hunleys blessing. Exeunt omnes. Enter Constable, and Officers, Warbeck, Vrswick, and Lambert Simnell, like a Falconer. A payre of Stocks. Const: Make roome there, keepe off I require 'ee, and none come within twelue foote of his Majesties new Stockes, vpon paine of displeasure. Bring forward the Malefactors. Friend, you must to this geere,—no remedie,—open the hole, and in with his legges, just in the middle hole, there, that hole; keepe off, or Ile commit you all. Shall not a man in authoritie be obeyed? So, so, there, 'tis as it should be: put on the padlocke, and giue me the key; off I say, keepe off. Vrsw: Yet Warbecke cleere thy Conscience, thou hast tasted King Henries mercie liberallie; the Law Ha's forfeited thy life, an equall Iurie Haue doom'd thee to the Gallowes; twise, most wickedly, Most desperately hast thou escapt the Tower: Inveigling to thy partie with thy witch-craft, Young Edward, Earle of Warwicke, sonne to Clarence; Whose head must pay the price of that attempt; Poore Gentleman—vnhappie in his fate— And ruin'd by thy cunning! so a Mungrell May plucke the true Stagge downe: yet, yet, confesse Thy parentage; for yet the King ha's mercy. Lamb: You would be Dicke the fourth, very likely! Your pedigree is publisht, you are knowne For Osbecks sonne of Turney, a loose runnagate, A Landloper: your Father was a Iewe, Turn'd Christian meerely to repayre his miseries. Wheres now your Kingship? Warb: Bayted to my death? Intollerable crueltie! I laugh at The Duke of Richmonds practise on my fortunes. Possession of a Crowne, ne're wanted Heraulds. Lamb: You will not know who I am! Vrs: Lambert Simnell; Your predecessor in a daungerous vproare; But on submission, not alone receiu'd To grace, but by the King, vouchsaft his service. Lamb: I would be Eare of Warwicke, toyld and ruffled Against my Maister, leapt to catch the Moone, Vaunted my name, Plantaginet, as you doe: An Earle forsooth! When as in truth I was, As you are, a meere Rascall: yet, his Majestie, (A Prince compos'd of sweetnes! Heaven protect him) Forgaue mee all my villanies, repriv'd The sentence of a shamefull end, admitted My suretie of obedience to his service; And I am now his Falkoner, liue plenteously; Eate from the Kings purse, and enjoy the sweetnesse Of libertie, and favour, sleepe securely: And is not this now better, then to buffett The Hangmans clutches? or to brave the Cordage Of a tough halter, which will breake your necke? So then the Gallant totters; preethee (Perkin) Let my example leade thee, be no longer A Counterfeite, confesse, and hope for pardon! Warb: For pardon? hold my heartstrings, whiles contempt Of injuries, in scorne, may bid defiance To this base mans fowle language: thou poore vermin! How darst thou creepe so neere mee? thou an Earle? Why thou enjoyst as much of happinesse, As all the swinge of sleight ambition flew at. A dunghill was thy Cradle. So a puddle By vertue of the Sun-beames, breathes a vapour To infect the purer ayre, which drops againe Into the muddie wombe that first exhal'd it. Bread, and a slavish ease, with some assurance From the base Beadles whipp, crownd all thy hopes. But (Sirra) ran there in thy veynes, one dropp Of such a royall bloud, as flowes in mine; Thou wouldst not change condition, to be second In Englands State without the Crowne it selfe! Course creatures are incapable of excellence. But let the world, as all, to whom I am This day a spectacle, to time, deliver, And by tradition fixe posteritie, Without another Chronicle then truth, How constantly, my resolution suffer'd A martyrdome of Majestie! Lamb: Hees past Recovery, a Bedlum cannot cure him. Vrsw: Away, enforme the King of his behaviour. Lamb: Perkin, beware the rope, the Hangman's comming. Vrsw: If yet thou hast no pittie of thy bodie, Pittie thy soule! Exit Simnell. Enter Katherine, Iane, Daliell, and Oxford. Iane. Deare Ladie! Oxf: Whither will 'ee Without respect of shame? Kath: Forbeare me (Sir) And trouble not the current of my dutie! Oh my Lov'd Lord! Can any scorne be yours, In which I haue no interest? some kinde hand Lend me assistance, that I may partake Th'infliction of this pennance; my lifes deerest Forgiue me, I haue stayd too long, from tendring Attendance on reproach, yet bid me welcome. Warb: Great miracle of Constancie! my miseries, Were never banckrout of their confidence In worst afflictions, till this now, I feele them. Report, and thy Deserts, (thou best of creatures) Might to eternitie, haue stood a patterne For every vertuous wife, without this conquest. Thou hast out-done beliefe, yet, may their ruine In after marriages, be never pittied, To whom thy Storie, shall appeare a fable. Why wouldst thou proue so much vnkinde to greatnesse, To glorifie thy vowes by such a servitude? I cannot weepe, but trust mee (Deare) my heart Is liberall of passion; Harrie Richmond! A womans faith, hath robd thy fame of triumph. Oxf: Sirra, leaue off your jugling, and tye vp The Devill, that raunges in your tongue. Vrs: Thus Witches, Possest, even their deaths deluded, say, They haue beene wolues, and dogs, and sayld in Eggshells Over the Sea, and rid on fierie Dragons; Past in one ayre more then a thousand miles, All in a night; the enemie of mankinde Is powerfull, but falfe; and falshood confident. Oxf: Remember (Ladie) who you are; come from That impudent Imposter! Kath: You abuse vs: For when the holy Church-man joynd our hands, Our Vowes were reall then; the Ceremonie Was not in apparition, but in act. Be what these people terme Thee, I am certaine Thou art my husband, no Divorce in Heaven Ha's beene sued out betweene vs; 'tis injustice For any earthly power to devide vs Or wee will liue, or let vs dye together. There is a cruell mercie. Warb: Spight of tyrannie Wee raigne in our affections, (blessed Woman!) Reade in my destinie, the wracke of honour; Poynt out in my contempt of death, to memorie Some miserable happinesse: since, herein, Even when I fell, I stood, enthron'd a Monarch Of one chast wif's troth, pure, and vncorrupted. Fayre Angell of perfection; immortalitie Shall rayse thy name vp to an adoration; Court every rich opinion of true merit; And Saint it in the Calender of vertue, When I am turn'd into the selfe same dust Of which I was first form'd. Oxf: The Lord Embassador, Huntley, your Father (Madam) should a' looke on Your strange subjection, in a gaze so publicke, Would blush on your behalfe, and wish his Countrey Vnleft, for entertainment to such sorrow. Kath: Why art thou angrie Oxford? I must be More peremptorie in my dutie;—(Sir) Impute it not vnto immodestie, That I presume to presse you to a Legacie, Before wee part for ever! Warb: Let it be then My heart, the rich remaines, of all my fortunes. Kath: Confirme it with a kisse pray! Warb: Oh, with that I wish to breathe my last vpon thy lippes, Those equall twinnes of comelinesse, I seale The testament of honourable Vowes: Who ever be that man, that shall vnkisse This sacred print next, may he proue more thriftie In this worlds just applause, not more desertfull. Kath: By this sweet pledge of both our soules, I sweare To dye a faithfull widdow to thy bed: Not to be forc't, or wonne. ô, never, never. Enter Surrey, Dawbney, Huntley, and Crawford. Dawb: Free the condemned person, quickly free him. What ha's a yet confest? Vrsw: Nothing to purpose; But still 'a will be King. Surr: Prepare your journey To a new Kingdome then, (vnhappie Madam) Wilfully foolish! See my Lord Embassador, Your Ladie Daughter will not leaue the Counterfeite In this disgrace of fate. Hunt: I never poynted Thy marriage (girle) but yet being married, Enjoy thy dutie to a husband, freely: The griefes are mine, I glorie in thy constancie; And must not say, I wish, that I had mist Some partage in these tryalls of a patience. Kath: You will forgiue me noble Sir? Hunt: Yes, yes; In every dutie of a wife, and daughter, I dare not disavow thee,—to your husband (For such you are Sir) I impart a farewell Of manly pittie; what your life ha's past through, The daungers of your end will make apparant? And I can adde, for comfort to your sufferance, No Cordiall, but the wonder of your frailtie, Which keepes so firme a station.—Wee are parted. Warb: Wee are a crowne of peace, renew thy age Most honourable Huntley: worthie Crawford? Wee may embrace, I never thought thee injurie. Crawf: Nor was I ever guiltie of neglect Which might procure such thought. I take my leaue (Sir.) Warb: To you Lord Daliell: what? accept a sigh, 'Tis heartie, and in earnest. Daliell. I want vtterance: My silence is my farewell. Kath: Oh—oh,— Iane. Sweet Madam, What doe you meane!—my Lord, your hand. Dal: Deere Ladie, Be pleasd that I may wayt 'ee to your lodging. Exeunt Daliell, Katherine, Iane. Enter Sheriffe, and Officers, Sketon, Astley, Heron, and Mayor with halters about their neckes. Oxf: Looke 'ee, beholde your followers, appointed To waite on 'ee in death. Warb: Why Peeres of England, Weele leade 'em on couragiously. I reade A triumph over tyrannie vpon Their severall foreheads. Faint not in the moment Of Victorie! our ends, and Warwick's head, Innocent Warwick's head, (for we are Prologue But to his tragedie) conclude the wonder Of Henries feares; and then the glorious race Of foureteene Kings Plantaginetts, determines In this last issue male, Heaven be obeyd. Impoverish time of its amazement (friends) And we will proue, as trustie in our payments, As prodigall to nature in our debtes. Death? pish, 'tis but a sound; a name of ayre; A minutes storme; or not so much, to tumble From bed to bed, be massacred aliue By some Physitians, for a moneth, or two, In hope of freedome from a Feavers torments, Might stagger manhood; here, the paine is past Ere sensibly 'tis felt. Be men of spirit! Spurne coward passion! so illustrious mention, Shall blaze our names, and stile vs Kings o're Death. Daw: Away-Impostor beyond president: No Chronicle records his fellow. Ex: all Officers and Prisoners. Hunt: I haue Not thoughts left, 'tis sufficient in such cases Iust Lawes ought to proceede. Enter King Henry, Durham, and Hialas. K: H: Wee are resolv'd: Your businesse (noble Lords) shall finde successe, Such as your King importunes. Hunt: You are gracious. K: H: Perkin, wee are inform'd, is arm'd to dye: In that weele honour him. Our Lords shall followe To see the execution; and from hence Wee gather this fit vse: that publicke States, “As our particular bodyes, taste most good “In health, when purged of corrupted bloud.
