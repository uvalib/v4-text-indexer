      <field name="fulltext">T«he» Tragedy of Sr Iohn Van Olden Barnauelt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus pri?: Scæa. pria. Enter Barnauelt, Modes[t]-bargen, Leidenberch, [Vandermitten]. Grotius Bar. The Prince of Orange now, all names are Lost els that hee's alone the Father of his Cuntrie? said you not soe? Leid. I speake the peoples Language Bar. That to his Arme, &amp; Sword, the Prouinces owe their flourishing peace? That hee's the Armyes soule by which it moves to victorie? Mod. So 'tis said, Sr. Leid. nay, more: that without him, dispaire, and ruyn had ceaizd on all, and buried quick our safeties. [Vand]. Gro. That had not he in Act, betterd or Counsailes and in his execution set them of, all we designd had ben but as a tale forgot as soone as told. Leid. and with such zeale that is deliuerd, that the Prince beleeves it; For Greatnes in hir owne worth, confident doth neuer waigh, but with a covetous hand hir lightest meritts: and who add to the scale seldom offend«.» [Vand]. Gro. 'Tis this that swells his pride beyond those lymitts, his late modestie ever obserud; This makes him Court the Soldier, as his owne creature, and to arrogate all prosperous proceedings to himself, detracts from you, and all men: you scarce holding the second place. Bar. when I gave him the first I robd myself: for it was iustly mine; the labourinthes of pollicie, I haue trod to find the clew of saffetie for my Cuntrie requird a head more knowing: and a courage ? as bold as his, [in«crea»sd with all the Armyes] though I must say 'tis great his stile of Excellencie, was my guift, Money, the strength and fortune of the war, the help of England, and the aide of Fraunce I onely can call mine: and shall I then now in the sun-set of my daie of honor when I should passe with glory to my rest, and raise my Monument from my Cuntries praises, sitt downe, and with a boorish patience suffer the Harvest that I labord for, to be ? anothers spoile? the peoples thancks, and praires wc h should make faire way for me to my grave to haue an other obiect? the choice fruites of my deepe proiects, grace anothers Banquet? No, this ingratefull Cuntry, [and this bold] this base people ? [vsurper of what's mine] most base to my deserts, shall first wt h horror know he that could defeat the Spanish counsailes, and countermyne their darck works, he that made the State what 'tis, will change it once againe ere fall with such dishonor. Mod. be advisd Sr, I love you as a frend: and as a Wiseman haue ever honorrd you: be as you were then and I am still the same: had I not heard theis last distemperd words, I would haue sworne that in the making vp of Barnauelt reason had onely wrought: passion no hand in't: But now I find you are lesse then a man, lesse then a co?on man; and end that race you haue so long run strongly, like a child, for such a one old age, or honor s surfeyts againe haue made you. Bar. this to me? Mod. to you Sr. for is't not boyish folly (youthfull heat I cannot call it) to spurne downe, what all his life hath labourd for? Shall Barnauelt that now should studie how[res] to die, propound new waies to get a name, or keep a being a moneth or two, to ruyn whatsoever the good succes of forty yeeres employment in the most serious affaires of State haue raisd vp to his memory? and for what? Glory, the popular applause, fine purchase for a gray beard to deale 'in. [Vand] Gro. you offend him. Mod 'tis better then to flatter him, as You doe, Be but yourself againe, and then consider what alteration in the State, can be by which you shall not loose: Should you bring in (as heaven avert the purpose, or the thought of such a mischeif) the old Tirrany that Spaine hath practisd, do you thinck you should be or greater then you are, or more secure from danger? would you change the goverment, make it a Monarchie? suppose this don, and any man you fauord most, set vp shall yor authoritie by him encrease? be not so foolishlie seducd: for what can hope propose to you, in any Change wc h ev'n now, you posses not? Bar. doe not measure my ends by yours. Mod. I know not what You ayme at: for thirtie yeeres (onely the name of King you haue not had, and yet yor absolute powre hath ben as ample) who hath ben employd in office, goverment, or Embassie, who raisd to wealth or honor that was not brought in by yor allowaunce? who hath held his place without yor lycence? your Estate is beyond a privat mans: your Brothers, Sonnes, Frends, Famylies made rich, in trust &amp; honor s; Nay; this Grave Maurice, this now Prince of Orange whose popularitie you weakely envy was still by you co?aunded: for when did he enter the Feild, but 'twas by your allowaunce? what service vndertake, which you approu'd not? what victory was won, in which you shard not? what Action of his renownd, in which yor Counsaile was forgotten? yf all theis then suffice not yor Ambition, but you must extend it further, I am sorry that you give me cause to feare, that when You move next you move to yor distruction. Bar. yf I fall, it shall not be alone, for in my ruyns my Enemies shall find their Sepulchers: Modes[t]-bargen, Though in [yeeres] place you are my equall, the fire of honor, which is dead in you burnes hotly in me, and I will preserve each glory I haue got, with as much care as I acheivd it; read but ore the Stories of men most fam'd for courage, or for counsaile, and you shall find that the desire of glory was the last frailety wisemen ere putt of: be they my presidents [Vand] Gro. 'tis like yourself like Barnauelt, and in that, all is spoken Leid. I can doe something in the State of Vtrecht and you shall find the place of Secretarie which you conferd vpon me there, shall be when you employ me, vsefull [Vand.] Gro. all I am you know you may co?aund: ile nere enquire what 'tis you goe about, but trust yor Counsailes as the Auncients did their Oracles. Mod. though I speak not as a Flatterer, but a frend: propound what may not preiudice the State, and I will goe as far as any. —Enter 2. Captaines. Bar. to all my service, ere long you shall know more: What are theis? Leid. Captaines that raild vpon the Comissary. Bar. I remember. 1. Cap. why, you dare charge a Foe i'the head of his troope, and shake you to deliuer a petition to a Statesman, and a Frend? 2. Cap. I need not seek him, he has found me; and as I am a Soldier his walking towards me, is more terrible then any Enemies march I ever mett with 1. Cap. we must stand to it. Bar. you, Sr, you 2. Cap. my lord. Bar. as I vse this, I waigh you: you are he that when your Company was viewd, and checkd for your dead paies: stood on yor termes of honor; cryde out I am a Gentleman, a Co?aunder and shall I be curbd by my lords the States? (for thus you said in scorne) that are but Merchants, Lawyers, Appothecaries, and Phisitians, perhaps of worsser ranck? But you shall know Sr they are not such, but Potentates, and Princes from whom you take pay: 1. Cap. this indeed is stately, Statesmen do you call 'em? 2. Cap. I beseech your Lordship: 'twas wine, and anger: Bar. no Sir, want of dutie: but I will make that tongue give him the lye that said soe, drunck, or sober: take my word for't, yor Companie is cast: you had best complaine to yor great Generall, and see if he can of himself maintaine you: Come Modesbargen. —Ext Leid. I am sorry for you Captaine: but take comfort, I love a Soldier, and all I can doe to make you what you were, shall labor for you and so good morrow Gentlemen —Exit 1. Cap. yet ther's hope. for you haue one frend left. 2. Cap. you are deceiud Sir: and doe not know his nature, that gaue promise of his assistaunce. 1. Cap. who is't? 2. Cap. Leidenberch one of the Lords, the States: and of great powre too, [?]I would he were as honest: This is he that neuer did man good: and yet no Suitor ever departed discontented from him: hee'll promise any thing: I haue seene him talke at the Church dore with his hat of, to a Begger almost an howre togeather; yet when he left him he gave him not a doyt: he do's profes to all an outward pitty, but within the devills more tender: the great plague vpon him why thinck I of him: he's no part of that must make my peace. 1. Cap. why what course will you take then 2. Cap. a Bribe to Barnauelts wiffe, or [a fresh whore] a kind wench for my yong lord his Son, when he has drunck hard, ther's no way els to doo't. 1. Cap. I haue gold good store, you shall not want that: and if I had thought on't when I left London, I had fitted you for a convenient Pagan. 2. Cap. why, is there such store they can be spard? 1. Cap. [ay they abound Sir] [and you fight in the shade to those that serve there] [I meane in the tearme time, for now ther's a [Tearme] Truce Sr,] [the So?er's their vacation«:» the poore wretches] [a«re» horribly out of action at a new Play] [when they haue pawnd the«i»r smocks, to show their best gownes] [in the best roomes to the Gallants and hoong forth] [all their allurements, and «e'n» said alowd] [come «on», for we are for you: with a peece] [I could haue prest you one to follow me] [that should haue serud yor t«u»rne, and three moneths kept him] [from pickle herrings, oyle «bhg» and pilchers:] [But to Yor busines: let vs leave this fooling] [and try what gold can do«e».] 2. Cap. I thanck you Sir —Exeunt/ Scæa. 2a. Enter Barnauelt: Modesbargen, Leidenberch [Vandermitten]: Grotius: [Taurinus, Vtenbogart] Hogerbeets. Bar. The States are sitting: all that I can doe ile say in litle: and in me, theis Lords promise as much. I am of your belief in every point you hold touching religion, and openly I will profes myself of the Arminian sect. Gro. you honor it. [Tau.] Hog. and all or praires, and service. Bar. Reverend men yor loves I am ambitious of: Alreadie 'tis knowne I fauor you, and that hath drawne Libells against me: but the stinglesse hate of those that wryte them, I contempne. [Vtenb.] Hog. they are worthie of nothing but contempt Bar. that I confes too: but yet we must expect much opposition ere yor opinions be confirmd: I know the Prince of Orange, a sworne Enemie to yor affections; he h'as vowd to crosse you: but I will still stand for you; my advice is that having won the Burgers to Yor partie perswade them to enroll new Companies for their defence against the Insolence of the old Soldiers, garisond at Vtrecht; yet practise on them too: and they may vrge this, That since they haue their pay out of that Province, iustice requires they should be of their partie: all that is don in Vtrecht, shalbe practisd in Roterdam, and other Townes I name not; farther directions you shall haue hereafter, till when, I leave you. Gro. with all zeale, and care we will performe this —Ext. Leid. this foundation [] is well begun. [Vand]. Gro. and may the building prosper Mod. yet let me tell you; where Religion is made a cloke to or bad purposes they seldom haue succes. Bar. you are too holly: we live not now wt h Saincts, but wicked men, and any thriving way, we can make vse of what shape soere it weares, to crosse their arts we must embrace, and cherish: and this course (carrying a zealous face) will countenaunce our other actions; make the Burgers ours, raise Soldiers for or guard: strengthen or side against the now vnequall opposition ? of this [prowd] Prince [of Orange;] that Contem«n»s vs at the worst when he shall know there are some Regiments we may call or s, and that haue no dependaunce vpon his fauor, 'twill take from his pride and make vs more respected. —Enter Bredero, Vandort Officers.

Vandort like a true noble Gentleman, he has borne himself, and a faire fortunate Soldier: I hold the State Sir most happie in his care: and this torne Cuntry whose wounds smart yet, most bound to his deliueraunce. Bre. 'tis certaine his proceedings in this busines as in all els, haue byn most wise, and constant, and waited on with full wingd Expedition: how many Townes, armd with theis new Pretenders, stird vp, and steeld by founders of new doctrines the cullor to their Cause, hath he, (and sodainely) disarmd againe, and setled in obedience, and without bloodshed, lords, wthout the Sword, and those Calamities, that shake a kingdom so gently, and without noyce, he has performd this as if he had don it in a dreame? [1. lord.] most certaine Vand he ha's run through a busines, will much add to him, and sett his vertues of with greater lustre, But that a man so wise, as Mounseiur Barnauelt, so trusted, so rewarded for his Service, and one that built the ladder to his honor of open honest actions, strong, and straight still, should now be doubted. [2. lord.] I know not, nor I wish it not, Bred. but if he haue a fowle hart, 'thas byn hid long, and cu?ingly that poyson has byn carried Vandort. But why a Father to theis new professions? why should he strengthen those opinions, that all true learning much laments, and greives at, and sincks the soules sweet vnion, into ruyn, why theis my lords? and why in every Garrison vnles he had an end that shot at evill should he so strongly plant theis fire-brands, and through his powre, add daylie to their nombers? —Ent Bred. most sure he is suspected, strongly suspected but that a man of his great trust, and busines should sinck, or suffer vnder doubts, or whispers or loose his honor by an others envy is not faire play, nor honest: The Prince of Orange most thinck affects him not, nor he the Prince that either of their angry wills should prove a lawfull act, to ruyn one another, and not a medium of more open Iustice more equall, and more honorable step in man had no powre to stand, nor fall with honor if he be falce, honest, and vpright proofes will ripen the Imposture. —Enter Barnauelt &amp; his Son. 1. lord. here he comes Sir.

Or. my grave Lords, that it hath byn my happines to take in, and with so litle blood, so many Townes that were falne of, is a large recompence for all «m»y travell; and I could advise (that since all now sing the sweet tunes of Concord, no Sword vnsheathd, the meanes to hurt, cut off, and all their stings pluckd out; that would haue vsd them against the publique peace) we should end here. and not with labor search for that, which will afflict vs, when 'tis found: Something I know that I could wish: I nere had vnderstood, wc h yet if I should speake, as the respect and duty that I owe my Cuntry, binds me, it wilbe thought 'tis rather privat spleene then pious zeale: but that is not the hazard wc h I would shun.

Vandort. such mild proceedings in a Goverment new setled, whose maine strength had it's dependaunce vpon the powre of some perticuler men might be given way to, but in ours, it Were vnsafe, and scandalous; then the Prouinces haue lost their liberties, Iustice hir Sword, and we prepard a way for our owne ruyn when for respect or favor vnto any, of what condition soever we palliat seditions, and forbeare to call treason by hir owne name. 1. lord it must not be: such mercie, to ourselues were tirranie 2. lord. nor are we to consider who they are that haue offended, but what's the offence, and how it should be punishd, to deter others by the example Bred. which we will doe, and vsing that vnited powre wc h warrants, all we thinck fitt, we doe intreat yor Highnes (for willingly we would not say, co?aund you«.») as you affect the safetie of the State, or to preserve yor owne deserved honor s and neuer tainted loyaltie, to make knowne all such as are suspected.
