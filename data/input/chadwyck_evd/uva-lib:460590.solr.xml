      <field name="fulltext">JULIAN THE APOSTATE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Many of the facts stated or referred to in this Sketch, may be found in Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. On the night before the Emperor Julian fought his last battle, he had the dream which I have detailed in the first Scene of this Sketch; and it is recorded that on the night of his death he addressed his soldiers, distributed rewards amongst them, and conversed with the sophists around him, respecting the immortality of the Soul. The names of Anatolius, Nevitta, &amp;c. are taken from history.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. The Tent of the Emperor Julian. Nightânear day-dreak. (Julianâalone.) To-morrow?âaye, to-morrow. The bright Sun Of my life will set in blood. Dark, heavy clouds Are rolling round about me, yet my eye Can reach into the dim eternity, And in its bosom isâmy grave. Oh! then, Valour and War, farewell! Soldiers and friends, Who in tempest of the battle, once, With your loves girded me like triple steel, I must be gone. Morning and Night farewell! And all the beauty of this visible world; And thou, fair Air! who music art and perfume, Colour and light, and in thy silent arms Now nursest with cold dews the sleeping flower, And bidd'st the fever'd heart forget its pain, Shall I behold thee never again?âNever! A dull, protracting, melancholy word, That, in an alien language, talks despair. âNever!ââthen Hope is gone and time departed; And Happiness that flies and then returns, Making its presence preciousâall are gone. âIs there no armour of the soul wherein I may array my thoughts and vanquish Death? It may not be: my hour is comeâis come: And I must tread upon that shadowy strand A shadow, a pale solitary thing, For ages and for ages, and there be A Spirit, filled with human thoughts and pains, Languishing for some remote Elysium. Great Mars, look down upon me: Am I not Thy son adopted? oh! my patron Mars, My father, and my god, I perish here For want of succour. Fate and Death, at hand, Wait smiling for the dust of Julian; And the grave opens, with a sickly smile, Its hollow home, inviting me to rest. Awayâthis must not be. Imperial Rome Leans on my sword.âWho goes? [Anatolius enters.] Anat. My emperor! You areâ Julian. 'Tis nothingânothing. I am well. Come hither, Anatolius: sit by me. Tomorrow Iâpshaw! that's for after thought. Tomorrow we must give the Persians battle. What say you, Sir? Is your heart firm, or have These Syrian suns withered your spirit up? Anat. It is the same as ever. Julian. My good soldier. Anat. Let us but once meet Sapor face to face: We fly now. Oh! that we should fly from slaves, Whom we have fought and beat day after day, 'Till we were faint with conquestâ Julian. Forget this. 'Tis true, indeed, we take less time for breathing, Now that we march for Rome, than when we came Intent to see the Persian on his throne: And in our trumpets now the wailing notes Sound lingering and prolonged. Well! 'twas not so When we did visit Antiochâno, by Mars, Nor when we rode thro' Anatho, or pushed Our battering engines thro' the gates of Anbar. Those were good timesâgreat times. Anat. Aye, when we shook Down to the dust their sixteen towers of brick At Maogamalcha, and did mine our way Beneath the dark foundations of its walls, The Persian did not smile: there was no timeâ And yet, (before,) do you remember how They laughed upon us from their ramparts, and Sung out with lusty lungs triumphant songs About the glory of Sapor, (then he hid His head in Ctesiphon,) andâbut you droop, My noble king!â Julian. Good Anatolius, you Have been my friend and fellow soldier long; From my youth upwards. We have fought together In Germany and Gaul, and on the banks Of the black Danube, when its waters lay 'Tween us and Hope. Anat. Like a dark rolling Hell. Oh! I remember it. Julian. My spirit never Quail'd in those times of peril, yetâ Anat. My lord? Julian. Nor doth it now: but there is on my soul A solemn foreboding that to-morrow's lightâ âTo day'sâfor even now the clouds begin To break about the east, and dawn is here Before the stars have left us: Be it so. My fate comes onward with a hurrying step: I'll meet it as becomes me.âMy old friend, Bear with me, and believe no idle fears Shake me at this great hour. Thou shalt never Blush to behold thine old companion die, Who once fought well beside thee. Anat. Oh! you hurt me. By the great Jove you tear my heart away. Why will you do it? Julian. My dear soldier, this Is the last day of Julian. Mourn it not. Early I die, but in my life I have Seen many things that age but seldom looks on, Pleasure and power and peril. I have made Myself a name, and carried the Roman arms Nobly amongst the nations. I shall be Known to far ages as a man who bowed Before his ancient Gods, and left a path In which he thought he erred, for one more bright. Nor, when posterity shall speak of me, Will it forget to say that Iâ(I hope not) Was Anatolius' friend. Anat. I cannot stay. I shall be angry with youâOh! is it thus You tune my ear for battle. I shall not fight As I was wont: I know it. Farewell now; We'll talk of this to-morrow. Julian. Oh! to-day I must say something, Anatolius; And you must listen, for 'twill ease my soul. Fear not for me to-day. You'll see my sword As busy as ever at its bloody work, And, in the van, my plume. I have a leaf From the green crown of Victory. You shall see How soon we'll tame the Persian spirits down. Anat. Aye, now you speak like Julian. Oh! we'll beat These brown barbarians to their silken tents, As we were wont. Let's talk of better times, (If we must talk)âof the old Roman times, When our rich veins fed Conquest with their blood, And fear was stifled in our hearts. Awayâ We'll fight as bravely as great Julius did, And feast to-day with Sapor. Julian. You shall do it. And now but listen to me.âI have had A solemn dream. Methought there did appear The Genius of my country by my couch: He held the horn of plenty in his hand, And, covering it with a veil funereal, Shrouded his head in darkness: Slowly then Without a wordâone word, he floated out, And left me in my tent, alone. Anat. Go on, Go on. Julian. I 'woke and started from my bed, But there was nothing,ânought: So, I went forth, (Then wide awake) to look upon the sky; For I have studied deeply the high art Of Divination, and can read the starsâ Anat. You jest? Julian. No; by my father's spirit. Until now You never heard me tell of this: but, onceâ 'Tis long agoâat Athensâ(ere I dreamt Of Rome or of the purple,) I was wont To commune with her gray philosophers; And they did bare the secrets of the grave, And shew'd unto mine eyes Cadmean scrolls, Torn from the tombs of Egypt. I became An Eleusinian, and partook those rites Mysterious and sublime, which no man knows Save only the elect. I have listened to The famous oracles; and, once a day, Have heard at Thebes the lonely marble voice Speak out unto Apollo. I have learned Magic, and things which since the birth of time, Have all been hidden from inferior minds, Which better thrive in darkness than in light. Anat. And nowâ Julian. And now, I can divine my fate. Last night I saw my tutelary star ('Tis Mars) rolling in the blue firmament, Usurping all one quarter of the sky; At last he seemed to shake, and left his orb, Streaming athwart the heavens. Methought he went To meet the morn and died. By Serapis! I saw him vanish in the east. Anat. Away; And what of this? 'tis nothing. Julian. I am now Deserted by my planetary God. Ah!âthe sun comes: then I must haste to speak. âYou must remember when Constantius died; He left a widow. Anat. And a child. Julian. 'Twas so. Eusebia wasâev'n while Constantius' wife, Gracious to me. In boyhood, when I was Once in great danger, she did plead my cause, (You know how eloquent she was,) and saved me; And ever after, thro' my checquer'd life, She stood my friend. Beneath her warming smile My fortunes flourished, and I grew to power, Who else perhaps had lived not. Anat. That was noble. I did not know what cause you had to love her. Julian. She loved me; more perhaps than might become The emperor's wife; (for when I wedded Helena She was estranged awhile, and saw me not;) But my wife died, and then Constantius fell, Hated by all. Somewhat indeed of hate (Unjustly) clings upon his widow still. When I have perished, Anatolius, thou Wilt be Eusebia's friend? Anat. I will, I will. But you will live. Julian. But should I die, my soldier, (I must) do thou be poor Eusebia's friend. Bid her retire to Athens. She will there Be safe, and (for I know her,) glad to shun The imperial splendor. Well! what say you, friend? Julian to Anatolius speaks his last. Anat. I swear by allâby these hot shameful tears: Butâbut I too may fall. Julian. Look on this pacquet. Bear it about thee, and lest any harm (The Gods keep harm from thee) hinder thee from Befriending the poor queen, tell to Nevitta, Before the battle, this his general's wish. He will do all, I think, (but not as thou,) Eusebia's gloomier fortunes ask. Tell him To look upon my arm when I am dead, And he'll see there a scar I got in Gaul. It saved his life once: bid him think on that, And be my friend for ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. Julian's Tent.âEvening. Julian (on his couch, wounded;) Priscus, Maximus. Max. You 're easier now? Julian. Much easier: many thanks. âAnd so you think, good Priscus, that the Soul Doth of necessity quit this feeble clay, When the poor breath departsâthat 'tis not hung On muscle or nerve, or buried in the blood, As some will teach. For my part, I believe That there is good and evil, and for each Due punishment and reward. Shall we not meet Our friends hereafter, think you, Maximus? Max. I hope so, my dear Lord. Julian. What think you, Sir? Priscus. I must believe it. There is in the world Nothing to fill up the wide heart of man; He languishes for something past the grave; He hopesâand Hope was never vainly given. Max. Hope treads but shadowy ground, at best. Priscus. It isâ Max. A guess. Julian. And yet, Priscus is right, I think: And Hope has in the soul obscure alliesâ Remorse, for evil acts; the dread of death; Anticipative joy, (tho' that, indeed, Is Hope, more certain;) and as, Priscus says, That inward languishment of mind, which dreams Of some remote and high accomplishment, And pictures to our fancies perfect sights, Sounds and delights celestial;âand, above all, That feeling of a limitary power, Which strikes and circumscribes the soul, and speaks Dimly, but with a voice potential, of Wonders beyond the world, etherial, Starry, and pure, and sweet, and never ending. I cannot think that the great Mind of man, With its accumulated wisdoms too, Must perish; why, the words he utters live; And is the Spirit which gives birth to things Below its own creations?âWho is there? [An Officer enters.] Off. My Lord, the commander Nevitta asks An audience. Julian. Bid him come. I have not seen Our friend (how is it?) Anatolius here. [Nevitta enters.] Your hand, my good Nevitta: Well! you see We beat the Persian bravely to his camp; You'll tell 'em yet, at home, how well they ride In Syria, when we spur their horses on. Indeedâbut where is Anatolius?âGods! Come near Nevitta. Nevit. He hath given to meâ Julian. Then he is dead. Great Minos! judge him kindly. He was the bravest soldier. Nevit. He is gone Before us, my dear Lord. He had a task, Which I have sworn to do. Julian. Friend! many thanks. I'll look for thee hereafter, as for one Who did me noble service. Maximus, We've lostâ Max. Who? Julian. Anatoliusâan old friend: Our fellow soldier; nay, he was to me, A tutor in the art of war. In youth, I fought beneath him; after as his fellow; And last his king. He had great courage, Sirs; I saw him strike a bounding lion once, When taller men fled trembling. He fought well At Anatho, and Anbar, and in Gaul, And Germany, and Maogamalcha, when We washed ourselves in blood. Old Sapor now May sun him boldly on his parched plains. Yet, pardon, good Nevitta: thou art brave, As warrior may beâoh! and many others. Let it be Anatolius' perfect praise To say he well became his titles,âwell; And died like a Roman soldier. Nevit. I rejoice To see you better, noble Lord. Julian. I am. The pains are gone, Nevitta, and I pass Pleasantly on: the road leads to the skies, And mine's a summer's journey.âWho are they That wait without? methought I heard a sound Like murmurs: I would fain depart at least With my friends smiles around. Oh! let me have No wailing voices to disturb my sleep; No ghosts of injured men to come and shriek Perdition in my ears, and bar me from Golden eternity. Nevit. Your soldiers ask To see once more their Emperor. Max. They cannot. Julian. Bid them come inâI thank you Maximus For your kind care, but it will soothe my heart To look upon my soldiers once again. There's little time to spare, and I would fain Say a few words at parting. [Nevitta calls the Soldiers in.] Max. They are here. Julian. Welome my friends. Ah! raise me higher: thanks. Give me a moment for recovery. (a pause.) â These are nearly the words of Julian.Friends, And fellow soldiers, the good season of My death is now at hand, and I discharge (As doth a ready debtor) every claim Great nature makes; for I have long been taught By lessons of divine philosophy How much the soul is better than the clay That holds it, and that man should more rejoice Than grieve, when separates the nobler part; And from religion I have learned that death Early is proof the Gods do love us well. I have sought ever your happiness: firm peace Was my first aim, but when my country's voice Did summon me to arms, I bared my heart To war and all its dangers, knowing (for I could divine my fate) that I must die In battle.âNow unto great Jove I offer My thanks for that he hath saved me from disease, False friends and the darts of foul conspirators. He gave me a career of glory, and now An honourable end: thus much I've tried To say; but my strength fails me, and I feel Death is at hand. Chuse for yourselves, my friends, Another emperor now: the one who sheds His blessing on ye, is about to pass Unto the stars. Sold. Alas, Alas! Julian. Weep not. Oh! my good Soldiers, weep not. You have been All that your king has ever wishedâtill now. Oh! you unman me: let us say farewell Before we stain our cheeks with too much tears. YetâI've a few bequests. I love ye all Alike; but there are some (a few) to whom The chances of the war have made me debtor. Marcus! Sold. My Lord. Julian. Come hither, my good Marcus. âNow, by the God of battle, I shall weep, And shame my death at once, if thus you play The girl before me. Will you then betray Your emperor, now so many eyes look on? Sold. Oh! my dear Master. Julian. Marcus, you have laid A weight of gratitude upon my soul, Which it can ne'er shake off: yet be content Old Marcus, that I now, in this great hour, Proclaim thee my good servant.âLook! this chain Hath hung about me like an amulet, For many seasons. Wear it near thy heart, As the last gift of Julian. So, farewell. Fabricius you have done your part to-day, (And thro' the Persian war,) like a true soldier. Live henceforth a centurion. Here is gold For thee, and never in the after times Forget to interpose thy shield between A hot barbarian and thy living King: So hast thou done to-day. Before ye all I speak this of Fabricius: love him for it. Farewell, centurion. Now, come hither, youth. What is your name? Sold. 'TisâJulian, my great Lord. Julian. So then; my namesake. I am proud of you. Soldiers and friends, be sure, when I am gone, You shelter this young blossom of the war, Altho' he looks like Hylas, he can lift A spear like Mars. To-day I saw him strike A Persian to the ground, of twice his years; A giant fellow, who perhaps had else Trampled me down (for I was bleeding fast,) And sav'd me so much talkingâAh!â Priscus. You're pale. Come, bid the men farewell. Nayâ Julian. I believe It must indeed be so. Farewell, my Friends, (All friends and noble soldiers,) fare ye well. May the Gods smile on ye, and victory Sit on your swords for ever. So, farewell. [Soldiers go out.] Priscus and Maximus, is it not strange That I who but last evening (nay, by Mars, This very morn) was checked for my sad talk, By Anatolius, in a few short hours Should, in my turn, stifle the words of grief In others? Max. So it is. The mind is full Of curious changes that perplex itself. Just like the visible world; and the heart ebbs Like the great sea; first flows, and then retires, And on the passions doth the spirit ride, Thro' sunshine and in rain, from good to ill, Then to deep vice, and so on back to virtue; Till in the grave, that universal calm, We sleep the sleep eternal. Julian. You have not The wish to live hereafter, Maximus; Or you would feel how poor to the Soul's eye Are there our earthly joys. If Death were sleep, Why should we dread to sleep, who often court A noon-day's slumber, and who bless the power That gently on our eyelids lays his touch, In times of fever, tumult, grief, or pain? Oh! is it thus that ye would bid me think, Now I am going from ye?âMighty Jove! I do beseech thee, and thou, valiant Mars, My guardian God, look from your burning thrones Upon the fainting soul of Julian. Have I not lov'd and worshipped ye, and turned From other altars to bow down to yours, And will ye now desert me? I do ask Now as I die, a word (I ask but one For all that I have done) to tell the world My faith was good. I ask yeâshall the grave Clip up for ever in its chilling armsâ And are the stories of hereafter, fables? Are there not pleasures and consuming pains, Endless or limited, for good and illâ And dreamsâenchantments for the eye and ear Of all who earn the rare Elysium? And haunted Styx, where disembodied shapes Wander; and Tartarus, that profounder gloom, Filled up with wretches who were their own slaves,â And Fate, and dark Alecto and her train, And Death, and Rhadamanthus, mighty judge, And the most drear dominion of the deadâ O speak! a word, a glance, a gleam, to shew me The world to come.âThey sleep, or answer not. And yet will they move from their mighty rest, To hearken to my frail petitioning? I cannot hope it. Priscus, Maximusâ Farewell; I faint: My tongue is withered up. It clings against my mouth. Some airâair. Ah! This is death, Priscus. Oh! How like a child A Soldier sinks before him. Jove!â (dies.) Max. He faints. Priscus. He does indeed, for ever: his last breath Is mingled with the winds.</field>
