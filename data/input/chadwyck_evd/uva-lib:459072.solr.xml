      <field name="fulltext">QUERER Por. Solo QUERER: To Love only for LOVE Sake: A DRAMATICK ROMANCE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sir R. F. upon this Dramatick Romance, Paraphrased by him during his Confinement to Tankersly Park in York-shire, by Oliver, after the Battail of Worcester, in which he was taken Prisoner, serving His Majesty (whom God preserve) as Secretary of State. Time was when I, a Pilgrim of the Seas, When I, 'midst noise of Camps, and Courts Dis-ease, Purloin'd some Hours, to Charm rude Cares with Verse, Which flame of FAITHFUL SHEPHERD did rehearse: But now restrain'd from Sea, from Camp, from Court, And by a Tempest blown into a Port; I raise my thoughts to Muze on Higher Things, And Eccho Arms and Loves of Queens and Kings: Which Queens (despising Crowns and Hymen's Band) Would neither Men Obey, nor Men Command. Great Pleasure from rough Seas to see the Shore! Or from firm Land to hear the Billows Roare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Queen of Spain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue: (Called by the Spaniard The Loa, i. e. The Praise, because therein the Spectators are commended to curry favour with them:) Spoken by the Lady Isabella Velasco, and the Lady Isabella Guzman; the latter pulling the former in with her upon the Stage. Vel. I will not forth with thee (that's plain) Child, thou tir'st thy self in vain. Guz. Isabel, thy Face, Life, Meen, Be now my Second, now my Skreen. Vel. I Garb? I Spirit? Beauty I? What, oblige me with a Lye? Skreen thee that Face, thy Mettle fine, Which second is to none, be thine. I joyn with thee in the Prologue? I with the Audience to collogue, Stiling them Senate? Was I Born To Lead of Pigmies the Forelorn? There's Lady's work with all my heart! Guz. I, but, Velasco, take her part, Who of the Minikin Brigade The youngest is, the Lanspresade. Vel. Marry, a good, and mending Fault, But who must aftewards be sought To make me confident and bold? For, Guzman, neither am I old. Guz. Well, of the Play then I despair, Since with the Dames whatever's rare, Sprightful, Divine, is wanting all: For, no Dames, no Festivall. Unto whose Top-top-gallant Beauty To strike, is little Fly-boats Duty: Superlatives have there a Rise: Comparisons are odious twice. Vel. That Fear hath Reason on its side, But a worse matter I have spy'd: The pityous humane Poet, he Fears too, his Farce will tedious be. Guz. What a Fear that for the base Rout! What a misbegotten doubt! (“For Modesty may split it self “On a high Rock, or a low Shelf.) No, no, our Festival, howe're It in it self hath cause to fear, (For of Meninas even the name Speaks littleness) yet our great Dame (Whom, were She not Divine all out, Heaven would have made a humane doubt) Making it now her Offering Upon the Birth-day of the King, It must for that be understood Both short and sweet, and great and good, That It is Hers deserves Applause: Effects are measured by their Cause. Chiefly so fair Porch being made Thereto; as such a Mascarade, In which the Infanta's Self would be, To grace the Queens Solemnitie, The King too Her refin'd Gallant (For no high strain of Soul can want In one whose Body is so pure) What Favour doth not he ensure? It must be full as much at least As His Divine Sister exprest, With their two Brothers; All High Born: Children of Phœbus, and the Morn. The Dames w' are sure of to their powers: All then is safe, all then is ours: In so much Beauty, so much Glory. Vel. And the Forreign Auditory. Guz. Friend, thou wilt, drown in shallow water, Bespeak not Ills, things hap thereafter, My Life upon't, our Festivall To see, will hurt none of them all: Whip me, if of the Twenty four They feel not many hours creep slower. Vel. Away then with the Prologue, Wench: But beg not favour of the Bench, Nor silence: Nor whine out at first, Pardon our faults, (that Fault's the worst) Be out, nor praise the King for fair Beauty is perishable Ware, And I my Master would commend For parts alone which time will mend. Shape is the humane By of Kings, Who in the Main are God-like Things: Call me the Queen, French Flower no more, But in Field Azure a Sun Or;; Now so much Native of Casteel That ev'n Her Soul is Spanish Steel: Nor Charles and Fernand Branches both Of the old Lawrel of the Goth: But Scyons of a better Tree In Paradice's Nursery: And of MARIA (Glorious Dame) Beauty without, lin'd with the same (Since ev'n strong Lines cannot afford To do her right) speak not a word, But let her praise to it self sing Like Bells that, without pulling, ring. Guz. Kings should be prais'd with reverence then, As they are Kings, not as they 're Men; Their fortitude, and not their face; The sordid Flatterers Common-place: His Actions I will Celebrate; His parts, as they are parts of State; Much of King, in Years but few; Spains Honour, and her Indies new, And his fair Spouse. Vel. That task is Fames: Begin. Guz. Still vailing to the Dames.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Lady Isabella Guzman advances some steps, and begins the Main PROLOGUE, as follows. Whilst Thee Great PHILIP (apprehensive Scholar, In the Great Book of GOVERNING well Read) The Nations Wonder, and Applause, proclaim In every Action of thy Life a King; Whilst on the Occidental Gulphs a Yoak, Whilst on the Seas of the Levant a Law, Thy Hand imposes, and thy boundless Valour Props Heaven, and Is the Bridle of the Earth: Whilst thou art like thy Great Grandsire, before The Worlds suspension, and thy thundring Ships To Northern Regions, Arm'd with Plates of Ice, Are fiery Mountains on their snowy Waves; And thy Iberian Flags (Victory's Wings) Both Germanies and Africk fear, and strike to: (For if of old their Valour made those bow, They do't by Custom and prescription now.) Grace the Solemnities of thy bright Consort Which strive in vain to equal the Occasion, So every way Majestick: A Perfection Divine, the utmost stretch of humane Nature, And thou ISBELLA (fair even to the Soul, The Daughter of a King, whose valiant Hand More trusting to it self than unto Chance Hammer'd his Crown out with his Sword) receive With a benign and amiable Brow (It must be amiable) this small Earnest Of our Devotions; whom to see alone Claims Knees and Hearts, sat'st thou beneath the Throne: And thou, the pleating terrour of the Earth, In smooth Apollo's Spirit, Spirit of Mars, King of two Worlds, let thy good hap enjoy Another greater Empire in her Beauty. Vel. Live, Reign (High Princes) more than Time it self, And (fairer in your Virtues than your Persons) Drop Stars with Heaven: The blessed Progeny Of your Immortal Loves (your Beauties sparkles) Let Spain Adore, and in so great a Glory, PHILIP the Fifth expunge Fifth CHARLES's Story. And you young Men, who by your budding Greatness Proclaim the Splendour of your Royal Cradle, Pave with a lofty and a radiant Foot The Milky Way. And thou (the Envy of the Goddesses) Illustrious INFANTA may thy Fortune Equal thy rare Endowments. To be Fair Ah! let it not a woful Blessing be, Nor Beauty a desired Miserie. Vel. We two (Is'bellas) ISABELL Divine, Present thee one Play more, with more Refine, Fram'd and Endited by Earths greatest King, Penn'd with the fairest Plume in Cupid's Wing, Acted by Queens below, by Saints above; A truer Comedy, call'd, LOVE for LOVE. Guz. And may this Birth-Day [Ecce t' another Birth] E're next Spring do't with Flowers, perfume the Earth With a sweet Prince, like Him from whom He came. Vel. In FACE. Guz. In VIRTUE. Vel. In RENOWN. Guz. In NAME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Song After the Main Prologue, Painting the Festival of Aranwhez. The Flowers that most adorn Of Aranwhez the Plain (Following a black-ey'd Morn) A Laurel entertain; Of flow'ry May the King, Apollo's gallant Son, He at His Fifteenth Spring Ware of the Field the Crown: When His Seventeenth April came, Worshipping that Goddess yonder, Wonders wrought He in Her Name, But His Faith the greatest Wonder. CHORUS. O how deft, how sweet to boot, First handsome, and then light of foot; Tagus's Nymphs of best renown, To whom no Love nor Grief is known (Brighter, fairer) from Heavens Globe Steal away the Starry Robe, And the Earths embroider'd Gown! Of all the World admires For rare, a fair disdain, Plac'd bounds to her desires, And that best object made her Eyes refrain. How great, and how well plac'd, A Roses love? With Use How well was it at last Paid by a Flower-de-luce? Love from complaints is free: That we for once might find, Beauty may happy be, And Happiness be kind. CHORUS. O how deft, how sweet to boot, First handsome, and then light of foot; Tagus's Nymphs of best renown, To whom no Love nor Grief is known (Brighter, fairer) from Heavens Globe Steal away the Starry Robe And the Earths embroider'd Gown! Years (which deserve perpetual Spring, And which deserve to be his Years) Joy them, He that loves the King; And adore them, He that fears. Clasp let his early Valour on Strong and glittering Steel of Spain, Multitudes in whom alone Of Fernand's and Alfonso's Reign. Never let him rust with Calms But His Hand purchase, His Hand cut As many Crowns out, and as many Palms As his Fore-Fathers tumbled at his Foot. CHORUS. O how deft, how sweet to boot, First Handsome, and then light of foot; Tagus's Nymphs of best renown, To whom no Love nor Grief is known (Brighter, fairer) from Heavens Globe Steal away the Starry Robe And the Earths embroider'd Gown!

      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST ACT. Drums and Trumpets, and enter at one end of the Stage the Generall with a Truncheon in his hand, and Soldiers with Banners; before him Captives, and amongst them one of better appearance than the rest: At the other, Felisbravo habited after the Persian manner, with a Royal Train; and let the General approach him, laying the truncheon at his feet; and the General is to wear a lawrel Crown, which he takes off when he comes at the King. General. Vnconquer'd Sir. Felis. Rise wise and valiant General. Gen. Give me thy Feet, these Plants shall be my Lawrels. Felis. Gen'ral, into my Arms, into my Heart: To pay good Services is Kings best part: Relate thy Victory. Gen. Dread Soveraign, Mine The Sweat was, but the Victory was thine. With full two hundred Ships of monstrous burthen (Cramm'd with Land Souldiers too) the Foe usurp'd Thy narrow Seas, and hover'd o're these Lands As o're a certain Prey, on which he look'd As the sole Obstacle betwixt his high Hopes, and the Universal Monarchy. Thou (to receive this Storm where e're it falls) Stay'st must'ring on the Shore thy fearless Bands; In head whereof, thou Marchest bravely Mounted In silver Arms; writ in thy Face, and Star, The Son of Fortune by the God of War. Mean time, go I to hunt them out at Sea, Under th'auspicious flight of thy guilt Standard Approach'd them; Ship by Ship I visit thine (Guiding my self a Barge's Rudder) spurr'd On both sides with long Oares, and from each poop Bid ours remember, in that Azure Field We are our Island's, It is the Worlds shield. Wellcom'd on board my own with shouts, re-eccho'd With general acclamations of the rest, Which one by one bear up to pay my visit, And all come sooping underneath my Lee To fetch new courage; briskly we advance Upon the Foe, who all this while had stood With smiling silence on the trembling Flood. His potent FLEET was cast into the form Of a half-Moon, gaping to purse us up, As that dire African at dismal Cannæ Did once ROMES Army led by a rash CONSUL; Withal, to boast it self the Soveraign (Like horned Cinthia) of the curled Main. My brave Vice-Admiral (a second DRACO, Writing his laws in blood texted with flame) Swears by the Queen of Night, To be a perfect Crescent It wants light. As the proud Bearer of the three fork'd Thunder And winged Lightening on her tow'ring Plumes (On whom her Master Jove bestow'd the Empire O're all the feather'd People, for her service In the fam'd rape of ruddy Ganimede) Steer'd with her trayn, sails driving through the Clouds, Thence stoops Plebeian Birds; so his bold Frigat From a big Wave, on which she soar'd aloft In clouds of smoak, flyes at the Covey intire, Arrow of Gunpowder, Eagle of Fire. Not Priams City crackled in more Flames, When to the fatal Horse she op'd her Walls, Then did those wooden Towers; nor with more fury The Greek Host (usher'd by that Horse) did reign In her waste streets, than I with thy whole Fleet Sent whizzing amongst theirs (in foaming Mead) From feather'd Squadrons Thunderbolts of Lead. The Sea is made another Sea of Blood, The sayling Wood, a Wood of floating Bodies. In fine, a Victory by Sea robs thee Of one by Land: And of this vast ARMADA (Beneath whose weight the Main it self did shrink, And which did threaten ev'n the Earth to sink) The scattered fragments kiss thy princely Feet; Ships, Captives, Banners, Streamers, Rudders, Keels, Tall Masts, and launching Oares, Now the torn Spoils and Trophies of these shores. Of all thy Navy but one Ship is missing; And thou (King of the Trident, second NEPTUNE, Lord of four Seas) hast hurld A Bit, Fear, ENVY, on the Sea, Sun, WORLD. Felis. Once more, O let me hold such virtue fast! Gen. What dangers courts not one, thus doubly grac'd, His Kings Hand kiss'd, t' inspire him going out; Return'd, his Arms, to fence him round about? This rears your Bulwarks; for that Prince who takes One Souldier into favour, thousands makes. Felis. A Monarch's gracious Eye, preserving State, Makes a brave Souldier, and just Magistrate. Gen. Kiss all of you great FELISBRAVO's plants. Capt. Cross Stars! Felis. There's greatness in that countenance. Capt. I'm sure there's woe. Gen. This slave, of a high soul, Thy Name did conquer. Capt. At thy Feet I roul. Felis. How comes so stout and brave a Man to show Such poorness, as to sink beneath a woe? Capt. It is the least I feel; who much repine This should be thought to share one sigh that's mine. To be thy slave an honour always is, And now to me a seasonable bliss; A Good, which I do owe my Ill. Felis. Unfold To me thy Grief. Cap. 'Tis easier bourn, than told: For, though my life be thine, my grief's my own. Felis. Trust me with both, I have not Ruth alone, But Remedy. Cap. Though 'tis to saw a sorrow To tell 't, let me thy Ear in private borrow. Felis. General retire the Folks. Capt. Take then a pain Equally hard to speak as to contain. Exeunt Gen. &amp;c. Great FELISBRAVE, new Founder of this Empire; Phœnix, whose birth into the Throne began Out of the dissolution of a Swan; Who in the compass of two years, hast liv'd “A thousand Ages (for so much live Kings, “As they do Reign; Reign, as they do great things.) Tartaria, a famous Part of ASIA (For now it rivals her fair Countrey, who A Star in Heaven, is a Rose in Cyprus) Hath for its Queen the beauteous ZELIDAURA, Whom the most rich embroideries of Praise Serve for her wearing upon Common days, Those vulgar terms (with which a mortal Face Men basely flatter to the Morns disgrace) Those bold comparisons with new-born day And mid-day Suns (which Heav'ns and Gardens lay So splendidly to heart) are, of her Youths Inestimable blossom, most fair Truths; In whom perfections see nothing to mend by, And miracles themselves something to envy: To whose fresh Years, and Cheeks, the Aprils throng For flowry license to be fair and young Fel. Is she so fair? Capt. The least in her that's rare. Fel. And good? Capt. Yes, ten times more than she is fair. Fel. (Rare Wight indeed) Aside. Captive proceed. Capt. Those poor Examples, in which Poets feign Of much Romantick Princess such profane Impossibilities, out-done by Her, Her sobrer Beauty joyns sweet with severe, Majestical with humble, for a King, Not for a Woman, made: She takes the Ring; Guirds Steel, and Lawrel: Pond'ring on the acts Writ of Semiramis, and manly facts Of great Penthisilea, she becomes Of a light flame, as, at the kindling Drums, Achilles hid in lying Petticoat, His choice betraying what his face did not. A Man amongst her Counsellors she lives, A Woman with her Ladies; Laws she gives, And Hearts she conquers; beautiful, and wise. Fel. Is she so gallant? Capt. She doth Monarchize With such sage valour, that the world— Fel. Pass an. Seeing Felisbravo disturbed he stops. (What a rare Woman!) Capt. (What a curious Man! Aside. But, who can hear so great a Queen set forth, And not be ravish'd with her matchless worth?) Aside. I, by her Fame drawn from Cicilia (where The King my Father all those Nations fear As far as Nile) 'mongst many, to present My self one Trophy of her Beauty, went; True always, always firm, always in vain: And, when in highest tow'rings of my Flame, In lowest stoops of humble Adoration, Excess of Love with me was Moderation, And wonders possible; It so befel— Fel. 'She Marry'd? Capt. She! Fel. What prou'd? Capt. Invincible. Fel. Conclude thy Story then (and let her be In a good hour fair, and at liberty.) Aside. Capt. —My Father sick'ned (Noble Felisbrave) And, in a War where Love and Duty strave, That which I sided with was overcome; For, with two Ships to visit him I come, When fiue of that Armada meet with me (New-wrecking Quicksands of the cruel Sea!) 'Gainst which, receiving thousand wounds I strive, That, for their killing me, I might forgive Their making me a Slave; Thy Gen'ral comes To round thy Coasts: He them again overcomes, Chains them, conducts them, where the King may put Upon their Bellies his tryumphant Foot. I (Captive twice) on peevish Fortunes Frown Pretend not to establish a Renown: For a Fool too may be unfortunate. But if a King; If, by an Antidate Of early Virtue, when years fifteen came Thou wrot'st Eternal; If thou 'rt like thy Fame; If thou knowest Pity: If admitt'st of Tears, To supple thee; Of Prayers, to storm thy Ears; Past Ages, to incite thee; History, To make thee glorious to Posterity: Offers to throw himself at the Feet of Felisbravo, but he doth not permit him. Or set me free, or kill me instantly; If it be possible a wretch can dye. Fel. Rise, gallant Youth, and Courage new acquire. Capt. My Soul bates to be gone, proud to expire At so brave Feet. Fel. (Alas, he swounds!) and mine Two tender Passions doth partake from thine, (Let in at several doors) Love at my Ear, Grief at my Eye: Hoe, General! Gen. I am here. Enter General. Fel. New matter that thy virtue may not miss, Save me this Slave from death; and tell him this, A King (that knows how to be one) commands Thee, trust thy Life and Fortune in his hands. Gen. He would not let his wounds be drest. Fel. Ply, serve him As thou would'st me; and all the Gods preserve him. The General carries him out upon his shoulders, and Felisbravo remains alone. What Circe in a moment hath purloyn'd The wonted peace and freedom of my Mind? What War is this, that lays soft batteries Unto a Soul inur'd to Victories? What heav'nly Zelidaura is this same? What new device of Love, out of a Name To shoot so sweet a Poison? O, then I Less wounded Slave! Thou 'lt leave me, if thou dye, Something t' envy in what thou dost deplore, And in thy Story something to adore. But, though so great a Beauty force my Love, And to suppress it against Nature prove, I'le be a better Prince, than Lover: Brave, And hard, therefore my Act! Free be the Slave: And (if he live) see Tartary; whilst I Of Love, of Sorrow, and of Honour dye. And let us bring in fashion, 'twixt us both, Justice in Rivalship, in Absence Troth. Enter General with a Picture. Gen. He lies all weltring in his Blood, and live He cannot: This fair Picture he doth give For thee to keep: And (if he dye) for Wife Prays thee to make a conquest of the Life, To him (he said) and all the World, but Thee, Angelical Impossibilitie. Fel. Reach it: Return, and let your care be more— (Gust yield to Reason)—then it was before. Exit. Tempt me not, Love: The Face I will not see, Blind Argus, if my Ears were scall'd by thee What second engine 'gainst my Eyes must move, To burn my Heart to Cindars? I, in love! I, pangs! I, pulings! I, to be afraid My Faith cannot deserve, my Vows perswade! Tears, from a Manly Face! Sighs, that shall find Themselves no more regarded than the Wind! Oh! Why should Love such servile things enjoyn? But why this Pride? Does Beauty not enshrine A Deity? Did it not Gods subdue? Then let it tame a Man, and let me view The lovely noble Feature; and the bright, Of this fair Shade. Love is a less'ning flight: When he doth vail his Plumes, it's such a thing As when an Eagle stoops upon the Wing. Looks upon the Picture This Face all Soul is, and so full of Life, That Life and Beauty are in it at strife Which shall be more:—What Spirits?—What Spells too? If in a little Card a Compass shew The Earth, and lay it out in several; In this, a Pencil hath Mapp'd Heav'n and all, And Mapp'd it to the Life.—For on these Cheeks Looks upon it again, and again (Where white and red divinely intermix) Aurora's hands hang snowing Jesamines, —Her Fingers bleeding Roses;—The Moon shines Bright in these Tresses, where each Hair's a Ray; —Two twinkling Stars;—Two speaking Rubies;—May Buds;—The Morn Blushes;—At one skip the Sun Gets up;—High Noon assoon as Day's begun! I'l love, I'l dye (O most unhappy man!) In love a Phœnix, and in death a Swan. Enter General. Gen. The Captive (Sir) is something livelier. Fel. How? What doest thou say? Gen. That he is better. Fel. (Now Aside. Must he needs mend?) Good News: And I would do thee Some good for bringing it. Gen. Heav'n keep him to thee. Fel. Love, I shall crush thee yet, as arrogant As false too as thou art; As I am Man, I may be staggered; but, as I'm a King, (Born for more Sov'raign Ends) thou canst not throw me, We, should, with sprawling of our Childish Arms, The cruel Serpents of Alcides strangle: We, in the midst of all the Sirens Charms, Should the wise caution of Ulisses carry. Let my desire be tam'd, and not My Obligation be forgot; I more provoking Envy's Sting As virtuous, than as being a King; The World admiring in my Pains Sober Madness, and free Chains. Exeunt. Trumpets, Enter the Queen Zelidaura, her Head-dress full of Plumes; Roselinda Lady of Honour to her, Prince Claridoro, and Train, as in heat of Argument, begun in the Tyring-Room. Zel. My Will to me's a Law. If it appear Prepost'rous for a Woman Arms to bear, Let it suffice I make the Precedent. Since there be Men effeminately bent, We Manly Women must that wrong undo; For you see sometimes Nature can lie too. Claro. Brave Zelidaura, thy Heroick Mind Who does not wonder at? Zel. Little inclin'd Always to sloath, the Pride I have, I place In a great Heart, and not in a fair Face. If on the Borders of my Land, we have A Novelty so manifoldly brave, A woing Warfare, this Inchanted Queen, A Beauty the more sought the less 'tis seen, Nor of less difficulty to the Wit Than to the Sword, shall I not step to see't? To see such Noble Action? chiefly I Giving the frailty of my Sex the Lye? Not, that my Courage hath so much of heat, As to thrust Prudence wholly from her seat; So metled I am not, as if that I Affected it to quit deformity; Nor yet so foolish as some Women are, Who for that only do suspect they 're fair. Claro. Heav'n, that created thee thus warlike, stole Into a Woman's Body a Man's Soul. But Nature's Law in vain thou do'st gainsay: The Woman's Valour lies another way. The Dress, the Tear, the Blush, the witching Eye, More witching Tongue, are Beauty's Armory: To rally, to discourse in Companies Who's fine, who courtly, who a Wit, who wise And with the awing sweetness of a Dame (As conscious of a Face, can Tigers tame) By Tasks and circumstances to discover Amongst the best of Princes the best Lover; (The Fruit of all those Flowers) who serves with most Self diffidence, who with the greatest boast; Who twists an Eye of Hope in brayds of Fear, Who silent (made for nothing but to bear Sweet scorn and injuries of Love) envyes Unto his Tongue the Treasure of his Eyes: Who, without vaunting shape, hath only Wit, Nor knows to hope reward, though merit it: Then, out of All, to make a Choice so rare So lucky-wise as if thou wert not fair. Zel. Will men ne're leave this freak? that Beauties fate Is neither to the wise, nor fortunate? Envy would have it so, She usher'd in This vulgar Errour, or some scorn'd Mans Spleen Or homely Womans Comfort. Prince, that Dame Who lets her self be lov'd with a true Flame, Considers not how ill Ingratitude Will look, when she must afterwards be rude. Should I examine if this Mans a Gull, Or th'other Gull a Lover? Poor, and dull! To render him the object of my Care, Who should be of my Scorn! Only Despair Will I allow to Men, nor can dispence With so much shew of hope, as diligence. What a fond antiquated Errour? (Save me!) I must call't Love, because a Man would have me For his none-self: He swears he's mine alone; Then (grosely) prays me not to be my own. Ros. Sounds it not merit unto thee for one To serve thee, who is braver than the Sun? Zel. Would'st thou have me admire and value than The painted Plumes of any Peacock-Man? I've Pride enough my self. It makes me smile (And yet I'm vext) to hear what Love the stile And serving in a Gallant; to new sheath Himself each day, not let his Mistress breath, But haunt her to the Park, or to the Bourse, On that the vulgar call a goodly Horse; Hat in the hand, her colours in the hat, Then tell her with a trembling boldness—(What?) That he's an Ass; Affect a diffidence, Yet wear her Porch out; making diligence, Smell rank of Hope. If Importunity Is call'd Desert, what more absurd can be Than for a fair one to become his prey That hunts her down? Let Greater ASIA Her Princes send their Valours here to prove: I would see Fighting, and not hear of Love. Ros. Our Ancestresses would; but we (more wise) The Ignis fatuus of Love despise. Claro. These Ceremonies which thou seek'st to bar, From the first hallowing fundamental are To Lady-hoods fair Order; for, discreet, Secret, and stout, and gay; of a compleat Lover, are the Ingredients: And in Spain The gallant Mock-war of the Bulls, and Cane Doth in a Courtly Valour comprehend Both that which you, and that which I commend: For those fierce Games (though Sports they called are) Proclaim in jest what Men in earnest dare. Zel. Secret (quoth you!) If he must trusted be With nothing, what's his secrecy to me? Thou (CLARIDORO) do'st extremely erre, If thou think'st Courtships can this Bosom stir; Not my Affection, Body, Air, and Meen; But Soul, Deeds, Virtues, purchase my Esteem. Thy brave Youth hazzard in this Enterprize: (For Sloth in Princes is a double Vice) Whence, if thou conquer, thou com'st burnish'd forth With Glory; if thou dye, what greater worth Than to lose well a Life. Claro. But I keep mine, To be spent better in some Cause that's thine; Mean while, at thy adored Feet it lies: And where can be a nobler Enterprise, Than to o'recome thy Love's disdainful, high And Beautiful Impossibility? 'T has more of danger in it too: For there My Valour combats, but with Thee my Fear. If thou dispraisest Praise, neglectest Care, And hatest to be lov'd, why art thou fair? Zel. I am not fair, nay fair I will not be; And less endure to be so call'd by thee. If Truth, where is the favour? if a Lye, It mends me not. What vain Civility! (I wonder it should please some as it doth) A great Lye 'tis, and would be a small Truth. Claro. Be not displeas'd that I thy Beauty praise; 'Tis a Debt which my Eye owes, and my Tongue pays: Give me thy Heart then, or thou'lt dye in debt. Zel. If I have thine, where? Shew me my Receipt. Claro. 'Tis well: The anger of a Mistress swells In thee; in me a Lover's Patience dwells. Ros. If all thy Servants thus thou entertain, I look this Prince too should be bond, or slain; For of the other nothing yet is known. Zel. Ay, and absence kill'd him, he hath done The part of a Wiseman and of a Lover. Claro. Th'Inchanted Castle doth it self discover. Zel. A goodly Fabrick! Claro. Princely! Zel. If the Cloud Shine so, what does the light that it does shroud? Claro. The two wings various workmanship seems rather A Sphear, than Pallace; Miracle, than either. Zel. The uniform and equal structure vyes Twin-Beauties so, 'tis Musick of the Eyes! And its perfections (greater their fame) The stile of Royal, for Divine disclaim! Ros. It shews 'midst so much Beauty, as delights, A Majesty that awes, Honour that frights. What Monsters muster! Claro. That of Creet (I think) I am surveying, and his Labyrint. Zel. Here hangs a Trumpet. Claro. 'Tis, without all doubt, T' advise when any strangers are without. Zel. Blow it, and call. Ros. Is it no more but so? Madam, when thou do'st call, do'st thou not know Thou call'st a thousand Monsters? Zel. Pish! We may Be, without fears, all Ladies—Blow, I say. One Blows the Trumpet, to which they answer from within with another, and a Gyant appears upon the Battlement. Gy. 1. Th'Advent'rer, who? Ros. (Dire shape.) Zel. 'Twere not amiss To learn before what the Adventure is. Gy. 1. You would not use your hands then, but your feet. Zel. With civil Gyant shall one never meet? Claro. He knows not thee. Zel. How many have pretence To Valour, only by their Insolence! Ros. Excuse them, Madam, the Books make them so. Gy. 1. Approaching Knights themselves in Armour show. Ros. Again? I fear me here will be a fray. Zel. A Troop of Horse? My Genius feasts to day. Ros. Madam, we are not safe. Zel. Mask'd in this dress Here will I stand to witness the success. Ros. But, Madam, why hast thou not made a new Inchanted Castle for thy Beauty too? Zel. Because that Beauty hath a stronger fence Which is immur'd with its own innocence. Sound Trumpets. Ros. All's War. Zel. Thy Fortune in th'Adventure try. Claro. Ah! how much more's th'Inchantment of that Eye. Exeunt. Enter Felisbravo, the General, and Rifaloro in the Spanish Habit, or how they will, out of the Persian, as in Journey towards Tartaria, Felisbravo replying to their disswasions from it. Fel. This is Love (start not at the word) 'twill blind Soonest the clearest sight, and (read) you 'l find Great Lover, and Great Prince, went ever joyn'd. It is a Spirit, an immortal Guest, The prop'rest Passion of a Kingly brest, As higher by the head than all the rest. If Bounteous, prudent, constant, valiant, Secret, and affable, and vigilant, Are Royal Stiles; and Love is all these things: See, if good Lovers will not make good Kings. “'Tis a dull Wisdom not to love, a curst “Imperfect Virtue; and it is at worst “A Manly fault high Beauty to adore. 'Tis fit my youth [divinely bent] explore, Not sweet variety to please my taste, But (to contemplate on) a Phœnix chast: Whom having found, out of the vulgar path, My Soul (then wholly taken up with Faith) Shall shut out hope; For this pure Spirit that grasps In its immenseness whatsoever Heav'n clasps, And Earth, contains yet but one Will; which one Should be so brave, and firmly mov'd upon Her centre, as to love eternally In a Life's moment: So without a Why, As if all Beauty it were death to covet, Or (saving only to love it) to love it, As if, ev'n to deserve, were to encroach, And the least spark of favour, Faith's reproach. Then, rackt with passion, to confess i'th'end A flame, which only pardon shall pretend, “Who (loving much) himself hath little sought, “If fault it be, hath done a civil fault. “Nor added to (in his more noble fire) “The sin of Love the crime of a desire: “Forcing his Mistress with too close pursuit “To kick him off with an enraged foot. “Importun'd pity causes just disdain: Whilst self-denyers may enjoy their pain. Rif. There's no such Lyar as your Lover is: Not one of them but says, not one does, this. Would'st thou have humane Love without desire? No, all below is culinary fire, Talk what they will. Fel. The Captive dy'd, and me This Zelidaura's Beauty calls, to see If fame have not been lavish in her Praise; And, following the bright Lanthorn of her Raies, (Pretending to that God a Pilgrimage Whom superstitious Greeks adore in Delos) I quit my Kingdom (a poor Complement) For I would quit as many, in her quest, As Spain possesses, or old Rome possest. But, if I greater than a Kingdom be, (Since where I am, I am not without me) What do I quit? Gen. Although there is no Law Which can a Countrey, and a People awe Like their King's Eye; thou leav'st at the stern two Great Statesmen, whose least praise, is that they bridle Envy's black Muzzel; who, of themselves good, Surpass themselves in goodness; since we see They are the better ev'n for fear of thee. Fel. Their Zeal and prudent Courage prop my Throne: Yet I too am not absent, though from home For Princes care is over all that's theirs: Nor can good Kings have evil Counsellors. A King should be all Eye and Ear; he shou'd Be learned, to be wise; wise, to be good. Rif. I quake: This Prince was born to rule the World. O the transcendent baseness of a pack Of Hounds, of us, who (with what we call Loyalty) Not follow, but ev'n hunt so sweet a King, And worry him! For those, whom I have known To boast most faith, and pure devotion, Have never been concern'd how Riches Stream Ebb'd with our Master, so it flow'd with them. Gen. In Rifaloro (for thy Recreation) Thou hast a Mirth without scurrility, An understanding wrap'd in Raylery. In him is found a sober Madness, sport Without abuse; all very new in Court. A Man so honest, that he will (I know) Speak always truth to thee. Rif. He will not though. Nor lye, nor truth, shall from my mouth proceed, (Good my Lord General, there's no such need) Not lye, because to lye, is a disgrace; Not truth, for it belongs not to my place. My gay and frolick humour shall dispence, Not lyes (I scorn't) not truths (they give offence.) I, Truths? I'm not a Fool to that degree, 'T would count'nance lyes, to have truths told by me. Gen. Such then about all Majesty should come, As will tell Truths, and whom Truths will become. Sound a Trumpet within. Fel. What's that? Rif. A Trumpet here? Fel. I'm ravish'd! this To noble Ears the sweetest Musick is. Amongst these Trees a stately Pile I spy, Fair butt of the Desire, bound of the Eye. Gen. Is 't not the Sphear of that Illustrious Queen? Thy Heart's strong Load-stone, drawing it unseen? Fel. We are not got so far as Tartary: For yet we tread the Happy Araby. Gen. Draw neerer let us. Fel. Rather let us balk Vain Curiosities: For, when I walk Another way then towards my North Pole, I am complain'd upon by my own soul. Gen. See, various Works, and strange Inscriptions under, Where Novelties lay to arrest our wonder. Fel. It says here: Reads upon the Gate. I am a Bondage, or I am a Prize: I Marry with the Valiant, and the Wise: Valiant or Wise, alone, will not suffice. —And it says here: Beauty is deny'd a voice, In making for it self a choice: 'Cause Reason would not trust a Bliss I' a thing so prone to chuse amiss. The words are plain: But why they are writ here I cannot reach. Rif. I can. Gen. Then, prethee, say. Rif. To make wise fools of all that pass this way. Fel. Let's call. Rif. Here hangs a Trumpet: Must we call? Gen. Blow't, Rifaloro, do. Fel. If here I shall Be held, but for one instant, my Love mourns: For a true Lover's Heart sits upon Thorns. They call as before, and a Trumpet answers from within, and another different Gyant comes up, who puts off his Hat. Rif. They come. Gy. 2. Your pleasure, Knight? Draw near. Rif. What's that? 'Fig for your Courtship! Prodigal of Hat; Thou sleep'st in sheets, drink'st thy Sherbet with Snow, And wait'st on Ladies (doubtless) to a Show: A Gyant A-la mode— Gy. 2. What is your Worships pleasure? Rif. Worships too? Mountain of Bone, if thou canst tell us, do, What is embraced by this Castle's Dyke? Say, prodigy; to humane creature like. Gy. 2. The fair Claridiana, who gives Laws To all this Countrey: For so strange a cause, And in so strange a way, Inchanted here, As (if you are at leisure) you shall hear. The first Gyant comes up very angry, and the second sneaks away. Gen. Say on. Gy. 1. Peace, Busy; get you whence you came. Gy. 2. I go. Rif. He seems a Gyant, is a Lamb. Gy. 1. Who is't would be inform'd? Rif. A Squire. Gy. 1. A Squire? Squires are no piece of History: Retire. Rif. O Rogue! as long as this year and the last! Vizard of Valour! Gy. 1. Squire? It makes me— Rif. Nay, I deserve no better: Was I drunk, To raise that scandal on my self? Thou, Trunk; Thou, Pomontory; thou, deluge of flesh; Some Errant Knight with a white face shall thresh Thee out (I vow) and not one whole Bone leave thee, With glittering Morglay: For the gentle slit Over the Nose would never Gyant fit. Gy. 1. Out, Worm! Gen. Great Porter (Gyant is no more) Answer. Gy. 1. (Th'art troublesome) Upon what score? Wert thou a Knight, I would; but with this Mace I'l come, and purge you All out of the place. Fel. Must I hear this, and purse up the disgrace? Rude, saucy, arrogant. Gy. 1. ('Twere good, in troth, If Gyants should take notice of such froth.) Exit. Fel. Knock, knock a thousand times, for I am— Rif. (What, Orlando Furioso?) Fel. A new Hercules To break in fitters these enchanted Gates. But, what's Claridiana unto Me? Whether the wonder of the Earth she be, Or Envy of the Heav'n? Away, away; My Soul crys shame on me for this delay. Gen. Sir, though Love spur you, and your heart say no, Sleep, rest, repose a little; since you go So tyr'd: Do more for Nations (whose Lives sheath Themselves in yours) than for one Picture; Breath: Enjoy this cool cessation of the Sun, The gentle April's greenest Mansion. Rif. This flowry Wood (so well describ'd) enjoy; Thy love goes too, if thou thy life destroy. Gen. Sit by this silver-fed, and murmuring— Rif. Means he by that a Courtier? or a Spring? Gen. I go to see the Palfreys, do not move From the King, Rifaloro. Rif. Of this Grove Exit General. I am the sleepy Burgess.—Sleep'st not thou? Fel. Ill custom this of sleeping; a dull badge Of humane frailty: Thief of love and life. Rif. Has the world such a pastime, as dear Sleep? O folly of transcendent gust! to wink, And for some certain time of nothing think; But, if I were a King, I'd never lay My lids together, to reign night and day. Fel. If sleep invade me strongly, That may sever My life some minutes from me, my love never. But 'tis impossible to sleep (we know) Extended on the Rack: If that be so, Takes out the Picture. Dumb Larum, come thou forth: Eloquent Mute, For whom high Heav'n and Earth commence a Suit: Of Angel-woman, fair Hermaphrodite! The Moon's extinguisher! the Moon-days night! How could so small a Sphear hold so much day? O sleep! now, now, thou conquer'st me.—But stay: That part thou conquer'st, I'l not own for mine, Tempest I seek, not calm: If the days thine, Thou quell'st my body, my Love still is whole: I give thee all of that which is not Soul. And, since in Lodgings from the Street Love lies, Do thou (and spare not) quarter in my Eyes A while; I harb'ring so unwelcome Guest (As Men obey thy Brother Death's arrest) Not as a Lover, but a Mortal— He falls a sleep with the Picture in his hand. Rif. He's faln a sleep; so soon? What frailty is? More like a Husband, then a Lover, this. If Lovers take such sleeps, what shall I take, Whom pangs of Love, nor Honour's Trumpets, 'wake? Rifaloro falls asleep. Enter Zelidaura like a Huntress, with a Bow and Quiver. Zel. Solitude, of Friends the best, And the best Companion; Mother of Truths, and brought at least Every day to bed of one: In this flow'ry Mansion I contemplate how the Rose Stands upon thorns, how quickly goes The dismaying Jesamine: Only the Soul, which is divine, No decay of Beauty knows. The world is beauty's Mirrour; Flow'rs, In their first virgin-purity Flat'rers both of the Nose and Eye, To be cropt by Paramours Is their best of Destiny. And those nice darlings of the Land, Which seem'd Heav'ns painted bow to scorn, And bloom'd the envy of the morn, Are the gay trophy of a hand: We, that are Queens, in stile and power. Serve but to take up a Man's Game, Into his hands to put the same, Who may neglect us the next hour. “She on whom greatness Heav'n doth showre, “If she the Main is, or the By, The means of knowing is debarr'd; Therefore my Crown I would discard, Because it lets me not descry Whether my Fortune's lov'd, or I. I am not foul, nor very proud, Yet, out of measure jealous grown, Least Suitors (who my Pallace croud) Are come a woing to my Throne. But, as in vain, with rueful tone The am'rous Birds in flow'ry Vales Tell the fair Morn a thousand Tales; In vain do me these Lovers haunt: Little Twat'lers, ignorant Importuning Nightingales. With shooting I'll divert me— Rifaloro talks in his sleep, at which Zelidaura startles, and, turning, spies Felisbravo. Rif. (Rare sops!) Zel. I hear a Man—A Knight there lies, Who, in a Picture (eyes) the vaunted spoil Of some Court Beauty (whom he will beguile) Holds in his hand the Idol of his eyes. She draws nearer him. He sleeps; she loves him, by this light: For Men, if handled with disdain, Cannot sleep (they're in such pain;) But if once they're lov'd, good night. Sleep, and Love, are two blind Gods That have always liv'd at odds. Therefore th'Man that sleep is taking Little cares for him who's waking. Lullaby'd in Favours lap, No wonder this should take a nap. —Bless me! She loves him past all bound, His sleep could not be else so sound. He, her for ends, I lay my life; Those compast, his flame dyes. Sure, he consider'd her his Wife, For she hath clos'd his Eyes. O that her self had napping catch'd Her Knight! that she might weep To see the much, for him sh' has watch'd, Rewarded with a sleep. That she with rage might understand, In Men, that Truth most prize, How soon a favour in their hand Is less'ning in their eyes. She draws yet nearer. Lover (because ungrateful's worse, I say not foolish Lover) Thou shouldst have put it in a purse, The disesteem to cover. I'l take it from him: Let him wake As rightly serv'd, as inly madded, Fond Ship-wreck of a Bliss to make, Which he despis'd because he had it. Takes the Picture from him. Lady, thou art reveng'd by me; Without thee let him 'bide, Who, being in thy company, Could take himself aside: Whom favour made to face about: Who neither loves thee, nor did keep— Looks upon the Picture. But, what is this! without all doubt I dream, if he's asleep. I feel a hidden hand distil A poyson slow into my will. My Organs in their places stand? 'Tis I (unhappy Beauty!) I, limn'd? And in a Poltroons hand That sleeps upon his duty? Where's the due reverence to my state? (Heavens!) What is this face become? I, pocketted? And by a Mate That uses me for Opium? The Root of Womans Pedegree Makes me fear my self his Bride; Because my self I taken see (Whil'st he sleepeth) from his side. I should love him by One Token, That his sleeps are so unbroken; But he wrongs me (I'm sure) by two, Pictur'd, and neglected too. To know who 'tis, more fear in me Then Curiosity doth move: For little is his Quality; If 'tis not greater than his Love. Another fault I cannot find: A sweeter Man my Eyes ne're saw! Here were a Lover, if his Mind One by his Face and Shape could draw. If I have cost thee Love, (a pain Thou hast so rare an Art to hide) Thee I conjure, for my disdain Sufficiently be qualified. She hears the footing of some-body. (People approach.) Mask'd with my fear In this same place again I'll be, To know news of him—(Love, hold there) I was about to say—Of me. Exit. Enter Claridoro calling after her. Claro. Hear (fair one) thou a Man hast slain, Yet fly not for it; For, besides that 'tis in vain, 'T will make the fact more horrid: In vain: for (Flow'rs up-growing Where thou art going) O ZELIDAURA, see Each Rose accuses and confesses Thee! Through this dark Wood I shoot, Where thy scorns lead, And (Pencil of the Mead) Thy Milky Foot A Miracle doth show, That the red Flowers should spring from the white Snow. If thou 'rt enraged to find My Murdress, I declare, My silence doth prepare To pacifie thy Mind. But (Heavens!) How is that possible, Since when I tell my fear, my Love I tell? Felisbravo wakes, and begins to speak to the Picture. Fel. Can, Can it be that I have slept? Then let my sin my pennance be, For all that while I have been kept (Companion for a God) from thee. Misses the Picture. Hah! The Picture? I had rather My self were lost, (O heav'nly Father!) He whom to wake that could not make, Let him sleep, and never wake. In my Coffin I should blush Though I now dy'd of Grief and Love. One Life would for offending thus But slender expiation prove. If I dye, my grief dies too, If I would kill grief and all, Death hath something else to doe. Than to come when Wretches call. If I dye in fine, in vain Will a demi-cure be wrought: Death, that takes away my pain, Cannot take away my fault. Live then, I, and live my Grief; Wander my surviving Ghost (Stripped of her Solace chief) Round about this treasure lost. Let my Soul a stranger be To what e're of comfort tasts; And my Body dying see, Whilst long-lived sorrow lasts. Ill on me is well bestow'd, I have deserv'd so cross a fate, Whose misfortune most is show'd In that I once was fortunate. Claro. What does he prole about for here? Fel. 'Tis stoln from me (my Anger grow—) This Man hath stoln it—Cavalier, I'm one the World (I'd have you know) Hath bourn so great, that (though in jest) I cannot any wrong digest; And (by none else to be dismay'd) Of my own name I am afraid. Never did I, my whole Life long, With Raunts (you understand) Give to a Braggadocia Tongue The office of the Hand. Therefore, in courteous sort I pray, Deliver the Sun back. Claro. What means the Man? Fel. My Soul I say, Which I too long do lack. Claro. Is he not mad? Fel. Think not to put me off, By putting strangeness on; with it, in one Pencil, restore a thousand rays, a thousand Suns in one Picture. Claro. Yet, I cannot reach him. Fel. Restore it, or (I vow to Jove) th'art dead. Claro. I neither know your meaning, neither fear Nor esteem you: For let me tell you— Rifaloro wakes, and gets upon his fees in a great fright. Rif. What clattering's this? Fel. Not understand me? little Know'st thou whom thou offend'st. Claro. Thou know'st me little. Rifaloro draws and puts himself on the side of Claridoro. Rif. Do, tame that Colt. Fel. Thou do'st misken me doubtless. Rif. No, no, but to help one (a Medicine try'd) Clap a hot Coward to the other side. Fel. No fooling, my chaf'd fury shall consume him: Once I have sworn. Claro. And, if my honest word Thou wilt not take, I pawn thee here my Sword. They fight, when suddenly let there be a noise within, many Inventions are shot off, and all that may move horrour and admiration. Trumpets and Drums loftily. But what is this! Fel. What horrour! 'less Heav'n falls, Th'Inchantment is dissolving: or these Walls. The same. The noise continues, sound Trumpets with much harmony and clash of War. Enter the General, and let a Draw-bridge fall from aloft, parting Felisbravo, and Claridoro, and within let there appear a stair-case, by which the Prince Floranteo is to descend richly clad, and with him the Gyants, and let many horrible shapes be seen: And enter Zelidaura like a Shepherdess, and with her Roselinda in the same habit. Ros. The Adventure is try'd doubtless by some Knight. Zel. Hide me (rough Bark) while I enjoy this sight. But he that comes to try it, is the same That wore my Picture. O, fair Knighthoods shame! One Woman pictur'd, and another sought? That thou a Traytor art, is thy own fault: But, wert thou an ungrateful one, 'twere mine. Let all the stair-case be coverd with Arms, and Appurtenances of War, and the covering and floor covered therewith, and let there sally out of the mouth of a Serpent a black Gyant armed with a Club, and spitting fire. Gen. The matter, Rifaloro? Rif. Do thou divine, I cannot now the while, I do fear so; Fear with me, and hereafter we shall know. Floranteo puts himself between the two Adventurers. Flo. Generous Knights, ambitious of the honour To interweave Laurel with Oak, and twist MARS with APOLLO. From this dazling wonder, From this fair Prodigie, from this (now) truth, But a Romance to succeeding Ages, This general Loadstone, Babel that threats Heav'n, A great ill Neighbour with fantastick Towers Your coming hath proceeded. Hear what it promises, what it contains, To what it binds, what it observes, what teaches: Laomedon (the Glory of these Provinces Wise, learned, valiant,) in Arabia was The last of all her Kings, whose Magick Voice, Which silenc'd Circe's and Medea's Charms (Bridle of Sea and Winds) gave the Stars Laws. A Daughter had he (Natures Master-piece) Who might boast verify'd in her perfections All that base Flat'ry Lyes, so without Art Handsome, that her unaided Beauty chides The lyes and dims the truths of Rose and Snow, Her (crown'd with Roses and pale Jesamines A Maiden Queen) twelve flow'ry Springs being then Out flourish'd by her Beauty, the sole Heir Of her Sires Realm and Fame, and that so sole, That she stands fair for sole Executrix To the Arabian Phoenix— He (judging Beauty fit to be an Empresse, But an Electresse not, as having given So frequent cause of sorrow and disgrace To the unhappy Boasters of a face) To all the Nobles of this Land presents And in her hearing uses this plain Language, One foot now in the grave. Love and Ambition Will from the spatious Universe hereafter Draw many Suitors to my Crown and Daughter: I will not that endanger'd by the Syren Of cruel Flattery (which sings in Rocks T' intrap the wariest Ears) a false supplant, Or soft heart counsel her, Misfortune dark'ning The splendour of her Beauty; and, instead Of chusing a Wise Husband and a Valiant (Her Eye, perhaps, swaying her to a fair one) A Coward or a Fool govern ARABIA, This said (and seconded with a dire Spel) The cleft Earth trembles, utt'ring to the Air This glitt'ring Edifice; In which incloyst'ring His fair Inheritrix (with double wards Of task on task secur'd) He one Inchantment Locks in another, leaving (to the end Great Souls may try th'Adventure) much for Valour To cut, as much for Wisdom to untye; To have Arabia so (Her Queen the Prize) Defended by the Stout, Rul'd by the Wise. For (to oblige his Realm) he did ordain These two (which make one Perfect Prince) should Reign. Then on, Young-men, A Beauty and a Crown He gains that wins, the loser gains Renown. Fel. He who doth seek this Realm, this Beauty wish, Let him these dangers conquer, court this Bliss: Not he, who doth adore a greater Light, And mourns its absence in a longsome night. Zel. One worn? One sought? A third lov'd? (facil Man!) Fel. Nor think inamour him that Scepters can, Whose Mistress is all Dowry, who reproves The Common truck of Mercenary Loves By his more noble thoughts, and doth disclaim All guerdon but the glory of his Flame. Claro. The same say I, and that I too adore A greater Mistress, fortify'd with more Impossibilities than Heav'n hath Lights. Flo. I must propose a Question: Are ye Knights? Fel. I am. Claro. And I. Flo. Then tell them (Brocadan) The Law observed here by every Man. Gy. 1. The Law is this; That whatsoever KNIGHT Presumes t'approach this famous CASTLES sight Shall, if th'ADVENTURE he shall then eschue, Confess himself a FOOL and COWARD too, Else We, the GYANTS, and WILD BEASTS that wait On our Commands, are bound to fight him straight. Flo. And Whoso tries it, and shall fail, that he Remain behind t' expound the Mysterie. My Case: Who had the Heart t' attempt the thing, But not the fortune to succeed therein. Fel. Such baseness do these barbarous Laws obtrude On Knights, twice Valiant by their Oath and Flood? I'll end th'Adventure, that another's Eyes (More fair) may have a Rival to despise. Claro. Vyes he the Game? then I will see't, Whose Lawrels here I vow, For strewings to another's Feet, Not garlands of my Brow. Trumpets and Drums softly. Flo. Let the Trumpets give the sign Let the second Draw bridge fall, And to the proof of Wit divine Both enter, for that first doth call. The Draw-bridge falls down like a Percullis, and let Rocks full of horrour appear, and in them many dreadful Animals spitting fire. This Labyrinth decides the thing, Which he will shew he understands, Who by the one door entering, Comes forth by that which right against it stands Fel. Have at the Castle then. Claro. The same I say, This day I am immortalliz'd. Fel. This day Imp I new feathers in the Wings of Fame With which to Heav'n she shall advance my Name. Zel. Clear Spirits both; and, if one's Wit burn dim, I, in my Picture's right shall blush for him. But, if he twice prove Victor, he must Marry Th'Arabian Queen—It cuts two ways— Rif. They tarry Exceeding long (me thinks) my little bit What if try'd of Prowess, and of Wit? 'Tis but to thrid a Maze, and t' other thing Of being Valiant, and I am a King. Gy. 1. Said not I, Squires are only to look on In acts of Chivalry? Presto: Be gone. Rif. St. Belianis! a Snake stung my toe. Zel. In Court there's not a Worm but stings you know. Rifaloro either flyes back, or is swallowed into the mouth of one of the Monsters, or a Gyant snatches him, and the Gyant goes out in wrath. Sound Trumpets. Within. [Victoria! Victoria!] Zel. Who has won The Prize of Wisdom?— Claridoro enters at the contrary door. Claro. CLARIDORO. Flo. Son Of Pallas, shadow with that Tree thy Head, Which ciphers hope, and yet of scorns 'twas bred. He proffers Claridoro a Crown of Lawrel, and he refuses it. Claro. No Conquest this, since for an unseen face, And ZELIDAURA is not in the case. Enter Felisbravo very angry at the same door by which he went it. Fel. I lost the Prize of Wit the (stuff that lines A gallant Man) fond Errour! which defines It Wit, a misty Labyrinth to hit, More savouring of Memory than Wit, Whose lofty Plumes to higher things aspire, And fetch from Heaven the Promethean Fire. Quite contrary, a Memory was never A friend to Wit, but its discredit ever. Zel. The Man wants Brains, and well he may, that gives His Mind to sleeping so, and idlely lives. Trumpets and Drums softly. Flo. Again, Young man. Those Monsters which did bear Thy Wit respect, make now thy Valour fear. Claridoro draws and charges, and the Monsters spit fire. Claro. All their grim horrour does but whet my Blade. Have at you dogs. Zel. How bold he does invade! Flo. How bravely he attacks! Claro. But I aspire Impossibles; for though my Soul's on fire, Though it scorn all that's Monster, kick at danger, My strength is not immortal like my anger. O, Devils! Devils!— Claridoro retires, and Felisbravo assaults the shut Gates, and they open in two parts, and the Gyants appear to stop his passage. Fel. This day it will be seen, if Heav'n think fit, Valour shall recompence the the want of Wit. I come, pale Monsters: Coward Beasts, 'Tis I: In my Hand Thunder, Light'ning in my Eye. The Serpents spit fire, and go retiring and sinking down, and let the Gyants come with their Clubs, and let there be much tumult and demonstration of war and danger. Gen. This can my valour suffer! to forsake My King's brave side! Inchauntment I would make My way thorough thee, and his displeasure too, But that I know his Sword can more subdue. Zel. They run, they run, with steel, and terrour strook: Trumpets and Drums. His arm may play, he kills them with his look. Let the Gyants and Wild Beasts fly sinking down. Fel. Fantastick dangers! Conquests of light Air! Give me fresh Foes, for I have deaths to spare. Floranteo Crowns him with Lawrel. Within. [Victoria! Victoria!] Flo. To thy Brow This Lawrel MARS presents, there to root, grow, And multiply. Th'Inchantment 'twixt you twain Is now dissolv'd; In her it doth remain To chuse: And (see!) her Godhead doth unshrowd, Like Phœbus breaking glorious through a Cloud. Cornets. Let the Castle come down, with much Musick, and let doors fall open with Chrystal Casements, and much splendour, that it may be admirable to behold, and sitting in a Throne the Queen Claridiana with a Garland of Flowers upon her head. What a rare Beauty! Claro. May she Wit abhor. Zel. Grant, Love, she may not like a Man of War. Let Claridiana come forth of the Inchantment. Cla. Arrogant Knights, who (foolish and presumptuous) Before you have been Suitors, would be Husbands, One of you two ye look now I should chuse: How fond and vain an Errour! since there be Yet greater charms to overcome in Me. 'Twere more than time the disinchanted Queen Thank'd both your Loves for taking down her skreen. Could me by Conquest any Mortal claim, Or by his Wit (as people win a Game) I'd burn my self alive first. But, is 't Wit The windings of a Labyrinth to hit? To overcome two Serpents, a pretence To be the Son of Mars? To speak a Prince Valiant to cut and slash, doth not suffice, Nor to resolve a Riddle stiles him wise. Speaks to the Company. To be a King (wise-valiant) of these twain Which Battels wan? which Rul'd a Land with Brain? If my free choice my unjust Father rest, Why was my Will, why was my Reason left? I, by Inchantments over-rul'd to be? Not for two Thrones. My Body, but not Me, He did inchant—Prepost'rous! to bring one For us to see, when all's agreed upon? That our imposed Masters we must go First to obey, and afterwards to know? I ask not the sole making of my choice: But why am I deny'd my Negative voice? This Victory to me worse Thraldom is, If it oblige me to be his, or his. But it shall not, I'll love my self alone; Not of the Wise nor Valiant, but mine Own. Flo. Madam, a Queen might well chuse either; But of the two— Cla. This Queen likes neither. I, for a Husband, the Discreet would have; But, for a King, one both Discreet, and Brave. One I'll not injure, nor to two belong: Wise and stout you see are twain: Then (till they be friends again) If I refuse both, I do neither wrong. Zel. How resolute, and how discreet! Envy couches at her feet. Fel. How can be so wise, and fair, One that is not ZELIDAURE? Claro O, how worthy my applause! Though my Love another cause. Zel. I find I'm not in love, since I Nor Envy feel, nor Jealousie. Cla. First plead the Cause, and try by dint of words If Brain or Valour most adorns a King; Those proving vain, then come t' appeal to Swords, And let those tongues of steel decide the Thing: He who the Bays of both these Duels gains, May wear Claridiana for his pains. Fel. (How little I that Glory prize!) Aside. Claro. (How much do I that Bliss despise!) Aside. Fel. Where we left off, remember Knight, And the proud wrong which thou hast done. They lay hands upon their Swords. Claro. Thy Insolence doth me incite To end the Quarrel we begun. Zel. A Man who with my Picture came To combat for another Dame! I'm vext, but jealous not a whit. Trumpets softly. Hah! have we more Inchantments yet? They begin to fight, and let there be a noise like the first, and let them be all divided, as if they saw not one another. Claro. The Earth is hid with terrours dire. Fel. Heaven lets down sheets of fire. Gen. What obscurity! Claro. What sadness! Fel. What horrour! Zel. What affright! Cla. What gladness! Ros. What fear! Cla. Let twice my Liberty Victoria! Victoria cry. Let them all disappear, the Draw-bridge he closed, the Percullis drawn up, and the whole vansh in a trice. The End of the first Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the End of the first Act, the Lady Mary Cutinio, and the Lady Frances Tavara, came forth and Danced with swords (in form of a chain) The Gallery of Love. Then the following Song, between the first and second Act. I. Where Tagus, Crown'd with plumes of Woods, (Now master of the field) Makes to his Chrystal Yoak the Floods Of proud Harama yield. II. Beliza (Shepherdess on Earth The best that e're sway'd hook) The day of her Phileno's birth Did like an Angel look. III. And a new Quire of Nimphs appears To celebrate in Verse (At least if Gods do count their years) His happy Anniverse. CHORUS. And in this Novelty, With brave variety, We all joyn as one; For the better adorning In the Western Levant the fair years of a Sun, Which make all but one Morning. IV. Now festive, and Majestical Have lost, on Tagus's shore, The fear of being match'd at all, The hope of being more. V. After so much of Greatness shown, And an applause not under, Nothing will ever dare to own The title of a Wonder. VI. For that BELIZA's Name (the stuff Of everlasting story) Alone is Festival enough, And hath to spare of Glory. CHORUS. And in this Novelty, With sweet variety, We all joyn as one; For the better adorning In a Western Levant the fair years of a Sun, Which make all but one Morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND ACT. After the foregoing Song, loud Musick, and let Claridiana descend alone, by a pair of stairs on the right hand, and let it be quite another Scene. Cla. In what a War, Father unjust, Hast thou plung'd me? for what cause Didst thou confine my choice to Laws So Heterogeneal to my gust? What satisfaction to thy dust Can it be, I so should wed? Who put that fancy in thine head? That I should not be capabel To chuse for my own self, as well, As thou for me, after thou 'rt dead? O (in thy own opinion) wise! How have thy spectacles discern'd, That there, where I am most concern'd, I must be cozen'd by mine Eyes? Admit, they should their choice revise, And rue too late with sad reflection Their Errour in their undeception: Were it not better owe that Ill To the deception of my will, Than to the wilfulness of thy deception? If to Inchantments thou confide My happiness, thou may'st with much More ground, what I shall chuse for such, Trust to my Spirit and my Pride: If a Star's trusted to provide A Match for me, though that see far, 'Tis fair, and therefore like to erre In Happiness, and (with thy leave) As to Love matters (I conceive) A Woman knows more than a Star. If it be noted a thing rare, For Beauty fortunate to prove, Yet I may fortunately love; For what have I to do with Fair? But Beauty now will quite despair That ever Bliss to her should come, When (cruel Father!) by thy doom I, who have none, condemn'd must be, Dead to my self, to live to thee: Like a Watch candle in a Tomb. Is it decreed I must admit Perforce of Love? what madness, this? Serves Beauty only to hand bliss T'another, that usurpeth it? Virtue, Education, Wit, To be noble, to be fair, To be ev'ry thing that's rare, Let not these for ever be Woman's infelicitie, Let not these for ever scare. My years in Hymen's slavish bands! The freedom of my Soul reduc'd To live after another's Gust! I, moulded in another's hands! At an imperious Man's Commands! It must not be: Let Men divine With similies; Let them in fine Date Beauty by a flow'r that blows: (How everlasting in a Rose! How trivial in a Jesamine!) Fright Fools with this, That Youth's a blaze: That, which my Envy doth engage, Is the Prerogative of Age; Which from a higher ground survays The Labyrinth of humane ways, And, undeceiv'd by Time, doth know That all's deception here below; And whether calm, or storm appears, Is laid up in the Bay of Years, And lets it shine, and lets it blow. No ancient Fester, no new Sore, Makes Age wish Cupids Bow were burst, For Time by this hath cur'd the first; And high time 'tis, to have no more, Love's golden Field being now all hoar. Free I was born, and remain free; Mine own I am, If I will be Another's, 'tis my fault; with whom For me unhappy to become, Can never happen without me. Liberty, my noble Will: For these Ills, so well forecast, How bitter will they be to taste, When, imagin'd but, they kill? Indeed the Fates have us'd me ill: I ask them not Revenge, nor Pelf, But quiet, and to 'scape a shelf. This sure can be no great offence; 'Tis begging in my own defence To pray I may but save my self. Enter Floranteo. Flo. This now is Love's last Will, and last shall be, Which (thankful to the hand that gave me death) Shall leave my Murtheress a Legacie, And sigh her Blessings with my dying breath: And these shall be not the first tears, which, still'd Out of the Bosom's principaller part, Shall have the Fate of Wealth profusely spill'd, Which seldom meets with any grateful heart: And this shall be a Love so obstinate, That, for all Love it shall a pattern grow, To live in spight of Time, or Change, or Hate, Yet there's one comfort amidst all this woe, That, for a wretch his way to death to grope, There needs in fine, nor Remedy, nor Hope. To Her. Upon the License giv'n by thee This glorious Pile to come and see, Hundreds do flock, to view the Place, But thousands to behold thy Face; Whom, though these Knights did disinchant, Th'Adventure is not finisht yet, Because that Wise, and Valiant, Have not in one subject met: So, in the Sword again it lies, By Duel to decide the Prize. Cla. I weigh not my dead Sires command, Where his Will his Law I find; No King that ever Rul'd a Land, Could stretch his Empire to the mind. I wonder in my heart, that he (With all his Wisedom) could not see, The Husband he did fore-decree, Would not so well examin'd be By an Inchantment, as by Me: Nor so authentick in Love-matters An Old-Man's judgement, as his Daughters. This is a Lott'ry, I profess, Not giving him the happiness Who hath most worth but best success. And may not I acquainted be With who they are? Flo. It may suffice To know, they're both of Knights degree, And that thy Sire was very wise. Cla. I have a better way to know Who's Valiantest, and Wisest. Flo. How? Cla. He shall be the Valiantest Who my scorns best suffer can— Flo. Good. Cla. And him that loves me best I shall count the wisest Man. But sadly, I do live in fear; For, though I would not fair appear, And, though in truth I am not fair, Haunted I am, like those that are: And here, among these rustling leaves, With which the wanton Wind doth play, Inspir'd by it, my Sense perceives This snowy Jesamine (whisp'ring) say; How much more frolick, white, and fair, In her green-lattice she doth stand, T'enjoy the free and cooler Air, Than in the prison of a hand. Flo. Madam, Thou might'st be pleas'd to read Other Lessons in this Mead; All whose Flowers (as from the Spring) Take from thee their life and being. See, this Jesamine; which doth owe To thy Hand fingers of Snow, To its soveraign whiteness, how All his silver Banners bow! See, that sanguine Gilly-flow'r (Spicy, big with pearly showre) Which a new Aurora dips In the scarlet of thy Lips! See, the Lilly's so pure white, It might be margent to the Light! Such a white Foyl to those black Eyes Is that smooth Forehead's christal Rise. See; a quire of Nightingales; Bidding thee a thousand Hales; Twice taken for their Morning bright, By the Flowers; and by the Light! For in those clear Eyes, Ray for Ray, The Sun's translated, and made better, And, flow'r for flow'r, in those Cheeks May Copied in a Fairer Letter. But, least in limning Thee my Art Should play th'unskilful Painters part, Let this Christal River pass For thy liquid Looking-glass. See thy self there! but, if thine Eye Too long on that sweet Centre dwell— Cla. This Man (I fear me) by and by Will drop into Narcissus Well. Since now I came, where I am Witness to The Worlds Ambitions, I have no content. Flo. Not, that your self you disinchanted view. Cla. Thou nam'st the thing which I do most resent. Till then, I liv'd in jollity, On others dangers looking down, Form the serene Tranquility Which my Soul truly term'd her own: For, plac'd above what Man calls Bliss, And (into her self retir'd) By a heavenly Ecstasis Ravish'd, elevated, fir'd; She saw the multitude of Woes, A fair one on her self bestowes, When 'tis her Riches, and her Pride, To see her Lovers multiply'd. Who, ev'n to qualifie disdains (For, not disdaining, Beauty's dull) Must be content to take the pains To be reputed Beautiful. And, if with beautiful disdain To let Men fall, it be her stile; Ev'n by Refusals this they'll gain, That she hath thought of them the while. I look'd, if underneath the Cope Were one that lov'd, and did not hope; But from his Nobler Soul remove That modern Heresie in Love: When, hearing a shrill voyce, I turn, And (loe!) a sweet-tongu'd Nightingal (Tender adorer of the Morn) In him I found that one and all: For that same faithful Bird, and true, (Sweet and kind, and constant Lover) Wond'rous Passion did discover From the terrace of an Eugh. And, though ungrateful she, appear'd Unmov'd with all she saw and heard; Ev'ry day, before 'twas day, More and kinder things he'd say. Courteous, and never to be lost, Return'd not with complaints, but praise; Loving, and all at his own cost, Suff'ring, and without hope of Ease: For, with a sad and trembling throat, He breaths into her breast this Note, I love thee not, to make thee mine; But love thee, 'cause thy Form's Divine. Here now was candour! Here Faith strove! How rul'd a pain! how full of duty! Not his own happiness to love; But to love anothers Beauty! Where (O how base!) the Man, whose flame Soars highest, if he spy no Game, Aurora's self (so fresh so gay) Shall see him late a second day: And I was scandaliz'd at Love (If, since the thing did hence remove, The name remains) to find one can Believe a Nightingale, and not a Man. Flo. Believe't (when he does love) a Man Loves more than Bruits or do, or can: His tow'ring Passion scorns to vale T'a silly short-wing'd Nightingale. The Nightingale loves nothing else But the presence of his Dame; Love (like Faith) in this excels, That see, or not, it is the same. The Morning hears his Roundelaies, Which though she do not thank him for; A Dame, that listens to her praise, May be presum'd not to abhor. The diff'rence then is very great: For, where there is most diffidence, A Cause that can a hearing get Will pick an Eye of Hope from thence. But Oh! the space (Madam) the space Betwixt his passion, and relief, Who suffers, and restrains his Grief, Nor open'd to the Judge his Case. For once I will discover mine, Not to perswade thee to incline The least, but only let thee see What silence thou hast ow'd to me. O, how it sweeten would my pain, Could my Cause hope but to be cast Out, after formal sentence past, In the fair Court of thy Disdain! For, though I have a Patience Which needs not this experiment, Yet I would owe experience It self to being a Patient. Cla. Henceforth thou shalt not to my face Tell me I would not hear thy Case; Nor me with thy dumb Passion twit, For thou hast disinvelop'd it. Him, who his silence for respect Obtrudes upon my estimation, For punishment I will direct To speak in nothing, nor no fashion. For, if he persevere not mute, I'll tell him, and I'll (smiling) do't, What time his pain hath speechless been, 'T was 'cause (being small) he bit it in. Which if he now could do no more, But Love brake ope his prison dore; Though with dark-keeping he was mad, He's tame, since he began to gad. I make no diff'rence 'twixt a wrong, And telling me thou do'st despair; Love haulks at hope, when in a Tongue He walks abroad to take the Air. If nourish hope thou ought'st not, Thou Do'st thy self wrong, as well as me, Confiscating by speaking now The merit of thy Secrecie. He, that of honour understands, Pain'd, hath his cure in his own hands: The glory of concealing it, The smart of suff'ring it doth quit, And (Floranteo) for the Truth Of thy Affection, I should doubt it, But that one thing confirm me doth, That I desire to be without it. Flo. My Errour did not think to be So much beholding unto Thee: And faintly hop'd, from thine own mouth The undeceiving of my Youth. I, better than I look'd for, fare; Though I presum'd to entertain Some thought, that to compleat despair I might be help'd by thy disdain. Be not so prodigal of scorns, On me thy Rigours do not wast; With such a deluge of good turns I may grow insolent at last. And I to thee would owe no more, Meaning to dye to pay this shot, And set thee something on my score— Cla. I hear thee, and I hear thee not. Flo. My death will bring some good to thee In ridding thee of me. Cla. I doubt it: Thy death will bring no good to me, For I'll be rid of thee without it. Offers to go away. Flo. Into the Garden comes a Knight. Cla. Withdraw, that I may see, unseen, Whether, or no, he doth acquit The promise of his Princely Meen. Exit Floranteo. Cla. No Man was born to be my Husband, no Man Deserves a Love. For as, when this Man's scorn'd, His everlasting whining deafs a Woman; So that grows sawcy, if his Love's return'd. The best unjustly blames the worst of Fate, Is it unjust to give to all their due? He is a Man; enough to merit Hate: He loves me; that's unpardonable too. Nor let fair Virgins murmur at their chance Of being entit'led to ill luck. O dull, Though frequently repeated, Ignorance! Is't no good luck then to be beautiful? For if to make us happy, Men were able; What needed more to make us miserable? Enter Felisbravo. Fel. A second Argo, fraighted With Fear and Avarice, Between the Sea and Skies. Hath penetrated To the new World, unworn With the red footsteps of the snowy Morn; Thirsty of Mines, She comes rich back, and the curl'd Rampire past Of watry Mountains, cast Up by the winds, Ungrateful shelf near home Gives her usurped Gold a silver Tomb. A devout Pilgrim, who To forreign Temple bare Good pattern, fervent prayre, Spurr'd by a pious Vow, Meas'ring so large a space That Earth lack'd Regions for his Plants to trace; Joyful returns, though poor, And, just by his aboad, Falling into a Road Which Laws did ill secure, Sees plunder'd by a Thief, (O happier Man than I!) for 'tis his Life. Conspicuous grows a Tree, Which (Wanton) did appear First fondling of the Year With smiling Braverie, And in his blooming pride The lower house of Flowers did deride: When his silk Robes, and fair, (His Youth's imbellishing The Crownet of a Spring, Narcissus of the Air) Rough Boreas doth confound, And with his Trophies strews the scorned ground: Trusted to tedious hope So many months the Corn, Which now begins to turn Into a golden Crop; The lusty Grapes, which (plump) Are the last farewell of the Summers pomp; (How spatious spreads the Vine! Nurs'd up with how much care! She lives, she thrives, grows fair! 'Bout her lov'd Elm doth twine) Comes a cold Cloud, and lays In one, the Fabrick of so many days: A silver River small In sweet Accents His Musick vents (The warbling Virginal To which the merry Birds do sing, Timed with stops of gold the chrystal string) He steals by a green Wood With fugitive feet (Gay, jolly, sweet) Comes me a troubled Flood, And scarcely one sand stays To be a witness of his golden days. The Ship's up-weigh'd; The Pilgrim made a Saint; Next Spring recrowns the Plant; Winds raise the Corn was laid; The Vine is prun'd; The Rivulet new tun'd; But in the Ill I have, I'm left alive only to dig my Grave. Lost Beauty, I will dye But I will thee recover, And that I dye not instantly Shews me more perfect Lover: For (my Soul gone before) I live not now to live, but to deplore. Cla. (This is he that was more stout.) Aside. Fel. In these blind Paths I go, To hunt my Foe; Whom having once found out, His Blood shall purge the soyl Of a short nap, and an immortal spoyl. Cla. (Aside.) (Well (believe't) the Man's no Fool, Nor a boist'rous Sword-man solie: For Wisdom (taught in Sorrow's School) Is the Child of Melancholy.) Fel. Am I a Prince? or am I vile? Am I a refined Lover? Am I stout? yet all this while Not the Picture to recover? Cla. (Heav'n be juster then that he Have a Picture had of me!) Aside. Fel. Fairest Madam, well 'tis seen I was ignorant indeed, That durst wrong so bright a Queen— Cla. (Wrong'd he me in word or deed?) Aside. Fel. Yet wise enough I am to know Losing my painted Mistress, The unpainted one will after go— Cla. (Else she her self a Statue is.) Aside. Fel. A Voice! Cla. He has me in his Ear, Therefore will I my self unshroud, And try his Wit too—Knight. Fel. Who's there? Claridiana shews her self. What Heav'n! what Sun breaks through a Cloud! Cla. Though my presence All admit, Thy presumption wants much Wit, If, before the Enterprize Be wholly finish'd, thou suppose To pry into the Mysteries Which these inchanted Walls inclose. To tame two Dragons you account Is one Woman to subdue; But, upon an Audit, true, It will not to so much amount. Lovers are Heroical When they sigh, and when they weep, When before our Feet they fall, When they stand in studies deep. Manhood I despise not (This, And justly, all the World approve) But show, what kind of Manhood 'tis Which conquers in the Wars of Love: And, the great odds if Thou regard Betwixt My Self and this dire Spell, To vanquish It Thou found'st it hard; But Me it is impossibel. Aside. Fel. Respect may to this Dame be shown, Though Mistresse I another call: For, though the Heart can lodge but one, Civility hath Room for all. To Her aloud. Claridiana (Theam of Fame) I am a Man would blush my lame Should own an Object, but the most Accomplisht one the World can boast. And know my Spirit is so high, That at less Game it scorns to flye Then where the greatest difficulties lye. This, which my lucky Sword hath lately reapt, Was not the Victory I did design; Whose Valour for a Shield is kept To bear the brunt of scorns divine. Over strong Spells to be victorious, Guilds (I must confess) a name, But, to submit unto a Dame, This to me seems much more glorious. For there, my valour takes my part, My strength, and my good Sword, befriend me: But in this War I have no heart, No steel Brest-plate can defend me. If, first the Foe's invincible, And I betray'd by my own fear; T'o'recome how is it possible Where arms against my self I bear? In the glorying of my Love I abide no Competition, Nor in the cause whence it doth move, Nor of the pain in the fruition; Yet, so great Love my grief exceeds, And this grief likewise owns a chief: For a lost Lady my Heart bleeds, But't will not break, and that's my grief. Aside. Cla. Equally witty, and discreet; He covers, but not hides his Flame; Holds his Game so, that I may see't, Yet I'll not seem to see his Game. To him. With what end lov'st thou? Fel. With what end? My Love is the perpetual moving; No end in loving I pretend, No end will ever make of loving. Love is of Love the only scope: Love scorneth to be mercenary: You find not such a word as Hope In all the Lovers Dictionary. Nay, Love alone doth scandal me: For the silent'st and most wise, From sights, from peeping is not free Out at the casements of the Eyes. See, 'twill now, and now 'twill hear; And the least of joy it gits, Whether at the Eye, or Ear, Puts it clean beside the wits. First know, I have a Misteriss; Then, that to her true Faith I bear: And, where Faith once through kindled is, Superfluous are the Senses there. Cla. Hop'st thou nothing? Fel. Nothing I Either hope, or yet desire. Yes I do, to live and dye In this elemental fire. She, in her self, is proof 'gainst all: Then, for me to aim at her, Were to add a Brazen Wall; So successless is my Star. Nor so alone in things of Love; But my Life over and above, Because on her it doth depend, I have no power to make it end. And (the full Case to understand) My Life and Death, because in fine Love hath put them in her hand, Both are therefore out of mine. Aside. Cla. From the mark I shot not wide, When him of folly I did quit: For the sharp Sword that arms his side Hath much to envy in his Wit. 'Tis not against Majesty His discretion to approve; Nor, if his good parts I spy, Must it presently be love. His goodly shape, his flowing meen, His talk, and what his valour wrought, May claim attention from a Queen, Yet ne're sink deeper in her thought. A leaning (Knight) I do confess— Enter Zelidaura and Roselinda in the habit of Shepherdesses, their Faces muffled with silver Scarfs. Zel. In this Countrey-tone and dress Disguised rudely, safe we are. Ros. Man-like bent to feats of War Of a Woman's left in thee Only Curiositie. What boots it thee to understand Who a Man is? Zel. What doth't boot? When I my picture found in's hand, And now may opportunely do't? To Felisbravo. Cla. Lies your happiness in this, To overcome the other Knight? Fel. Madam, all my life and bliss. Cla. In the name of MARS then, fight— Aside. Who grant (say I) thou maist subdue! Zelidaura spies them together. Zel. Bless me! who is this I see? (Is it?—'Tis not—) Ah! 'tis He: With Claridiana too: O Sigh! base brat, not of the Royal Mind, With which I'm lin'd, But of this Clown's false cover I have drawn over. What matters it?—Much, the contempt—In Love The least misprission doth High Treason prove. This hath a tang of Jealousie. I, disorder'd? Plaintiff, I? Should any thing the Heav'ns beneath, Make me a mean complaint to breath! I, resentments! I, in wroth! I, concern'd in breach of Troth! I? who, to make fond Love depart, Hung padlocks on my Eyes and Heart. Though in this war, I feel beginning, I doubt not in the end of winning The victory; one moments wasting This way, I pay with blushes everlasting. Claridoro scorn'd, and curb'd, Not for neglect, but too much Love? Am I asleep to one I have disturb'd? Doth one, that sleeps at me, my Larum prove? Odd figaries hath this Cupid; Strangely kill'd, and strangely born; If kindness make him dull and stupid, And if that he be rows'd with scorn. But what have I to do with LOVE, And the frailer Woman's Law? Cla. Women are there in this grove? Then 'tis time that I withdraw. Aside. Fel. 'Twas for manners I forbore To take leave of her before. Ah! Zelidaura, (Mistress fair) No joy is, but where you are. Aside. Cla. Of Valour thou maist justly boast, That conquer'st wheresoe're thou go'st. Claridiana goes away by degrees casting looks back at him. Zel. So is split in twain a River, And the streams (bound sev'ral ways) In a kind of am'rous maze Back at one another gaze: As this melting Couple sever. Cla. Inclination, not so fast: For from me one gracious look, Speaks more in that diminutive book, Then other Women in a Volume vast. From me then (Love) enough is wrung: For where Honour tyes the tongue, She, who doth a Suppliant hear, Makes him answer with her Ear. To Him. Knight, to overcome endeavour. Fel. Lady, I shall do't, or dye. Aside. Cla. Disinchanted, more than ever Re-inchanted now, am I. Exit Claridiana. Zel. Just there, where I did point thee, stay: But come, if any bend this way. Ros. Alone you'll be, if I am gone. Zel. By my self, is not alone. Ros. True: The Man doth still remain. Zel. Then, I am alone again. Exit Roselinda. I'll see, whether his wit keep pace With his valour, garb, and face. Fel. What a spanking Labradora! Zel. Yow (th'unkent Knight) Godyegudmora! Fel. (The time of day thou dost mistake) Zel. —And joy— Fel. Of what? Zel. That I discover, By a sure sign, yow are awake. Fel. Awake?—the sign? Zel. Yowr being a Lover. Fel. In love am I? Zel. And very deep. Fel. Deep in love? how is that seen? Zel. Perfectly: yow do not sleep Fel. Rustick Excellence, unskreen, And discover that sweet face, Which covers so much Wit and Grace. Zel. Yow but dreamt so: sleep agin, And forget it. Fel. Why now (Saint?) Zel. Why? the Lady, that went in, Lukes, as if that she did paint. Fel. What has that to do with sleeping? She is, indeed, Angelical. Zel. That Picture now's well worth yowr keeping: For why? 'tis an Original. Fel. Is this Shepherdess a Witch? Or saw the sleeping Treason, which I committed against Love, Erst, in the Inchanted Grove? Me, hast thou ever seen, before? Zel. Seen? I, and know thee, for a Man That will turn him, and sleep more Than a dozen Dunces can. Thow kenst little, what Sighs mean! Fel. Unveil (by Jove) that Face serene. Zel. What, to make thee sleep agene? Fel. Still, in Riddles! Zel. Now, he sees: This pinching wakes him by degrees. Fel. Art thou a Nymph. Zel. Of Parnass-Green. Fel. Sleep I, indeed? or am I mad? Zel. None serve thee, but th'Inchawnted Queen? I think what dull conceipts y'have had, Of the Bird Phoenix, which no Eye E're saw, an odoriferous Lye. How, of her Beauties spells, she's told; That by her spirit thow art hawnted; And, having slept away the old, With this new Mistress worse inchawnted. Fel. I affect not, Shepherdess, My self in such fine terms t'express; Suffizeth me, an humble strain: Too little happy, to be vain! Vnveil— Zel. Sir Gallant, not so fast. He offers at her Scarf. Fel. See thee I will. Zel. See me yow shall: But, towch not Fruit, yow mun not tast. What says it, now the leaf doth fall. Unmuffles her self. Fel. It says, 'tis worthy to comprize The Kernel of so rare a Wit: Nor, that it grows in Paradice, But Paradice doth grow in it! The tall and slender Trunk no less divine, Though in a lowly Shepherdesse's Rine! Aside. This should be that so famous Queen, For unquell'd Valour, and disdain. In these Inchanted Woods is seen Nothing but Illusions vain! Zel. What stares the Man at? Fel. I compare A Picture, I once mine did call, With the divine Original. Zel. Fall'n asleep again yow are. We, poor humane Sepherd-lasses, Nor are pictur'd, nor use Glasses. “Who skip their rank doe'm selves, and Betters wrong: “T'our Dames (God bless them) such queint things belong. Here, a tiny Brook alone, Which, freng'd with borrowed Flowers (he has Gold and Siller enough on's own) Is Heavens proper Looking-glass, Copies us; and Its reflections Shewing natural perfections, Free from soothing, free from Errour; Are our Pencil, are our Mirrour. Fel. Art thou a Shepherdess? Zel. And bore On a Mountain called, There— Fel. Wear'st thou ever heretofore Lady's Cloaths? Zel. I Lady's Gear? Yes (what a treach'rous Powl have I!) In a Countrey-Comedy I once enacted a main part (Still I have it half by heart) The famous History it was Of an Arabian—(let me see) No, of a Queen of Tartaree: Who all her Sex did far surpass In Beauty, Wit, and Chivalree: Who, with invincible disdain, Would fool, when she was in the vain, Princes, with all their Wits about them; But, and they slept, to death she'd flout them. And, by the Mass, with such a Meen My Majesty did play the Queen: Our Curate had my Picture made In the same Robes in which I Play'd. Fel. And what's thy name? Zel. Laura, forsooth. Fel. O pleasant Play, and bitter truth! That I, who dreamt of Zelidaura, Should wake, should wake, and find her Laura! Aside. O beauteous Counterfeit of Majesty! Nature, what made thee make so fair a Lye? Where is that crowned Beauty now become? That Lyon's Courage, kindling at a Drum? Those manly Deeds? Those Papps, which Armour prest? Achilles once more in a Kercher drest? Semiramis 'is Mode, who not with Box, But Teeth of Laurlel, comb'd her golden Locks? Where, my heroick and dear Flame, which sprung From Painters Pencil, and a Captives Tongue? Consum'd to ashes of a Rustick Love, Rude Goddess of these Rocks, and this wild Grove? Is't come to this? I then absolve thee, sleep; And blame my high thoughts, that so low could creep. To Tartary will I, But I am mad If I do love that Queen, unless she add This Beauty to those Virtues; and shall rave If both this Body, and that Soul, she have. Aside. Zel. What stands he mutt'ring to himself? May be He likes me not. If he sought after me Under the notion of a Queen, I'd have Him find me a mean Shepherdess: I save My Honour so. The Traitor shall not think He (ZELIDAURA in his hand) could wink. Hence Women learn, for all your Lovers brags, Men are no friends to Beauty cloath'd in Rags. If Beauty strike Love's Fire, why should it, less, Than in a Queen, plac'd in a Shepherdess? Nor does; but (when it seems the World to set On fire) where dowry wants, the tinder's wet. To Him. Mought I entreat yowr Worships Name, And the bus'ness yow have here? Fel. Squire of a forreign Prince I am, Who to this glorious Theatre— Zel. Not a Master? By my troth My own tongues end it was upon: A mischief take thee, by thy sloth I thought thou wert a Zerving-mon. Fel. No more that string. Zel. He goes conceal'd: Aside. A Knight he is I'm certain; At Th'Inchanted Castle I saw that; And, by his garb too, 'tis reveal'd. To Him. Follows he (saidst thou) this Emprize? Fel. In love, upon the score of Fame, With the most accomplisht Dame That ever murther'd Man with Eyes, And the Worlds greatest Queen; to this Inchantment came he, where an envious Thief (The Coward Rival of his Bliss) Found means to rob him of his chief Delight, and Glory, in that thing From which his most Heroick thoughts did spring. Zel. O Usage, courser than my Coat, and more Then I could bear, were I as Lambkin meek! That one, who Zelidaura wore, Should Claridana seek! 'Tis to apostatize from Reason, To think more of him. Treason! Treason! To enter my Benevolence, At the back-gate of an Offence! Enter Roselinda. Ros. Claridoro comes—he's here: Muffle thee quickly. Zel. What disgust? Fel. One, to be born a Mountaneer, That ows such Beauty? how unjust!— Who is't Zel. A Man, of whom I stand In awe a little. Fel. (O, that hand!—) Rural Goddess, keep'st thou Sheep? Zel. Yes, and my self I better keep. Enter Claridoro. Claro. I'd love without reward, and cannot do't, To love, is Love's Reward; I would endure For her, what not? and that such joy to boot That in my smart I play the Epicure. I pray 'gainst Life, and with the self same breath Unpray that Pray'r, lest it the Gods should hear 'Tis to be out of pain; I then fly death, And Valour councels me what others fear. If I do live, my wound may seem but slight; And if I dye, Loves Trophy I remove: To live, 's to pine; to dye, 's to lose her sight; My two supporters then, are Grief and Love: For where Grief's Dropsie, and Love's Feaver strive, Though either kill, both often keep alive. To Felisbravo. Zel. In fine, aspir'st thou to be glorious By conqu'ring thy Competitor? Fel. 'Tis that my Love contendeth for. Aside. Zel. O, maist thou never prove victorious But do: for mine own self, I conquer will, And whom thou conquer'st then, it doth not skill. Claridoro turns and sees them. Claro. What's this? what feel I there? Is't not Zelidaure, who (meanly clad) Hath her own Majesty forgot, And affronts my Love too bad? What jealous thoughts surprize me? I do fear She (bent to Arms) affects the Valianter: But he was not so; if to dare things high Be Valour, who was valianter than I? I, who her first of Alms am yet to gain, Of her facility shall I complain? Was not enough for me my own distress, But I must dye of others happiness? My Soul contending with so many Foes, I would not have it link with Envy's blows. “More gen'rous wounds were made for nobler Hearts, “and in base blood are steep'd pale Envy's darts. Thus, jealous I should be, and know not how. Envy I could, but Envy disallow: Then must I bear it? must I? let me think— 'Twere monst'rous tameness to look on, and wink. Nor Love, nor Honour, such a Scene approve: I'll chide then, mixt yet with respect and Love. To Her. Ho! Shepherdess, is this well done To mind thy Recreation In Gardens, whilst another way Thy flock doth on the mountain stray? Although head-shepherd thou have not, Yet nothing is by gadding got. Perdie, to see thee in this plain, Grypes many a sprunt and jolly Swain. Back to the field, and Brooks return, And Pastures graz'd in heretoforn, Nor mell with any others sheep, Sith thou a flock of mine do'st keep. To Him. Nor Thee, th'ambition of whose fire Doth (soaring) to a Queen aspire. Beseems it stoop from so high place, A Rustick Shepherdess to chase. Zel. How courteously the cares that do him press He hath cut out, and measur'd by my dress. Fel. In rustick phrase his jealousie Of her he vents, and pike at me. Then I suspected not in vain He stole the Picture; in the face (When he espy'd it) reading plain The features of this Rural Grace. Undoubtedly she is his own— To Claridoro. You will not now, Sir, face me down, But that, when I bad watch did keep (Surpriz'd, e're by the foe, by sleep) Thy treach'rous Envy came an stole (Not more out of my hand than soul) A Jewel which I then call'd mine, Though much despise it since 'tis thine. Yet must and will I have it back, Not that I It esteem, or lack; For, the whole gust I take therein, Is now, to take't from thee agin. Claro. I think thou art not yet awake, But I shall rowse thee—Do'st thou stare? Zel. A truer word yow never spake: He sleeps with spread Eyen like a Hare. Fel. Traitor I'll be reveng'd— Claro. Rude Man! Aside. Zel. Must I step in to part you than? If I do rear it, on my word, This hook shall be a two-hand-sword— This she must say Majestically like a Queen, without Felisbravo's perceiving it. Hold both, or I— To Felisbravo. Claro. Though not thy Quarrel, mine I understand— Zel. Hold, Claridoro: It is I command— To Claridoro. Fel. In fine, do'st thou deny it still?— To Zelidaura. Claro. I obey thy unjust will. Enter Claridiana and Floranteo, with Attendants. Cla. Zelidaura was't you said, Like to a Shepherdess array'd?— Turns and sees them quarrelling. Swords drawn i'th'Garden? who are we?— Flo. Why Gentlemen, it cannot be, Whilst yet th'Inchantment is not brought T'an end, in Court a Duel fought Unlicenc'd? when with licence too Ye may the same thing shortly doe? To Felisbravo. To Claridoro. Claro. I come— Fel. Or do but stand me there— Zel. I'm rent with doubt. Cla. I dye with fear. To both. Flo. Provide ye Arms, and fight it out— Zel. (O how fiery! Cla. O how stout!) Claro. I never provide any thing— Within me I of all am stor'd— Fel. And I both a sharp stomach bring, And a long knife to fall abord. Fight again. Zel. How implacable! Cla. How cruel They do a fresh in Battail join! Zel. May neither conquer in this Duel. Cla. Yes, one! and then the Conquest's mine. Zel. In either Valour doth abound. Cla. Discretion is in neither found. To Claridoro. Zel. With thee how little I perswade? Cla. Our Guard! Of Monarchs that last Reason will be heard. She stamps, and sallying out, the Guard parts them. Claro. Madam, if now you stop our rage— Fel. The promis'd Combat— Cla. Take our gage— Throws her Glove to Felisbravo. Exeunt Claridoro, and Felisbravo at several doors, and Claridiana turns to Floranteo. To Floranteo. Would'st thou have me believe a Queen, whose name In Tryumph sits over the wings of fame, Lurks now disguis'd in Arabie? Flo. If her such manly virtue decks, That she's the wonder of her Sex, Were't not another wonder, she (Greedy of Knowledge, as of Arms) Should leave unseen these sights, and charms, Thy Realm too being so neer her own? Cla. Withdraw I'll talk with her alone. Exit Floranteo. Ros. Claridiana this way doth make To speak with thee— Zel. Two short words take— Your Count'nance hold, what e're you hear; Stop your mouth, and ope your ear. Cla. Hola! sprightly Shepherdess. Zel. What commands thy Ladyness? Cla. Discover, by thy life, that face. Zel. Now by the facks) this of your Grace Needs no comfort, nor no foyl, For Skies and Meads it doth revile. Or see (if thow mun needs have one To set it off) yon cloudless Sun! Then for thy Beauty (challenging Of Heav'n the witness principal) O're me a Gloria to sing, Would prove a conquest very small. Cla. Art thou fowl? Zel. But envious not, And so civil (markst Thow that?) That to acknowledge I'm not squeemish Her to be fair, who hath no blemish. Nor, where it is, will hit a Blot. Cla. Whom loves an ugly woman best? Zel. An uglier woman—Was't well guest? Cla. Thou, a Shepherdess? Prompt Lass, What is thy Bus'ness in this Place? Zel. Marry (no Treason 'tis I ween) To zee the fair Inchawnted Queen, And the brave dundring of Alarms: For, from my very Nurses arms, According to our Country word, I lov'd the slish-slash of a Sword. Cla. Loe, half thy Errand! I am she: And therefore, give consent that we Our Eye too with the sight may bless Of so divine a Shepherdesse. Zel. Highness, mock on:—Behold the Wight! Takes off her silver Scarf. Cla. O Golden Morn of Silver Night! What modest confidence! quick Air! What Spirit! what excess of fair! What queint, and more than courtly dress! What exquisite neglecedness Of those curling billowy Locks Flowing round two Ivory Rocks! What hands! that have to take their part Not care it self (so far from Art) Yet conquer all the World: wherein A red Soul peeps through the white Skin! Sol might envy her least grace. Zel. I knew, yow'd mock me to my face. How easily are People got To praise, that which they envy not? I am not yet a Clown so much, But, when I see yowr Beauty such, I find, into my Crown yow beat The part, I should to yow repeat. Nothing beneath, or in the Sky, Holds beautiful when yow are by: Possessing not so much in common, As Envy, with an ugly woman: But, when the splendor of your Rays Is more than all the World can praise, Releasing much of what should come to you, Yow pay to all the World above their due. Cla. A new delight her words provoke By the rare grace with which they'r spoke Zel. I know, why Lady likes my wit; And why my Face remains her debter. Cla. Why? Zel. I know— Cla. Then out with it. Zel. Vaith, because her own are better. I'd have all fair ones discommend My Face; I would upon my word. Cla. Why so, my understanding friend? Zel. O! then, they are with Envy sturd. Cla. But Envy croaks, and Snake-like stings— Zel. Believe me (Princess) no such matter: No Sycophant so sweetly sings: “For she that envies me, doth flatter. “This back-hand praise goes homest still, “'Tis strucken with so good a will. Cla. Envy is Adulation then? Zel. Thou hitst the Nail on the head right: And I have heard from Book-learn'd Men, “'Tis courtly Rudeness, and kind spight. Cla. Prethee, what wouldst thou counsel me to doe, If me for Goodness Envy should pursue? Zel. Be ten times better than thou wert before, That Envy may pursue thee ten times more. That is the way which I affect, No treason lurks, no malice there, If I my self alone correct, To be at full reveng'd on Her. Cla. In every point she doth perform— Zel. Envy, a piteous creeping worm! “A brave, and happy Pride it is, “To envy neither Worth, nor Bliss. Cla. Do'st thou happily know Love? Zel. Who is his Worship? Is it not A forreign Prince, who, they said, dy'd above A twelve-month sin of a great Cold he got? Yes, by hear-say, I do know him, Not that any spleen I owe him For mischief he to me, or mine hath done: Though I have heard a long-long-while agon The Court he troubled, and the Countrey spoyl'd, Till he both Court and Countrey was exil'd. Cla. Do'st thou not Love? Zel. A Question To ask a fool, have I not youth? Cla. Whom lov'st thou then? Zel. My sell alone— Nay, I have a curious tooth— Love? what a base disgraceful word! The sound is harsh, and shrill. Lyes all the Valour in the Sword? No conquest o're the Will? Nor it a decent part hold I (So much unto my self I owe) To speak of that thing knowingly, I do not, nor I will not know— But do yow love? Cla. What is to Love? Zel. To deny't. Cla. A Rustick Lasse? Hard question to one bred in Court't would prove— Zel. Not when she's in her Teens my word I'll pass. If yow do love, with wond'rous Care Hide that unfortunate disease: For (feggs) declar'd Affections are The Mother of Unthankfulness. I knew a Gallant (from zuch keep) Who, having zome how made his prize, But a Dame's Picture, dropt asleep With that Sun shining in his Eyes. Cla. Troth, let them sleep or let them watch, All Men alike are cheap with me: To whom (for favours none they catch) They never can ungrateful be From Love (a contemptible Foe!) My retreat make I by broad-day; And look on Suitors just as though They were Mad Lovers in a Play: No, Fear not me, in such a way. Zel. Kenn'st thou the Tow're where Confidence doth dwell? Repentance lives hard by in a low Cell. Cla. Ill dissembling Shepherdess (For now dissemble Shepherdesses too) If thy Courtesie's not less Than thy Beauty, thy Name shew. By my Life. Zel. A powerful Spell! This now would make a Gallants heart Leap out, much more his name Cla. Well, well, Tell me both what, and who, thou art. Zel. Fairest Claridiana, than, I say I am no Shepherdess— Cla. A Woman asks not like a Man— Tell me thy Name— Zel. I am—(suppress My name I will—) a great Lord's Daughter, Nor a less Soldier; taking after My Father so much, that his Trade I follow in the Mountain-shade: For such do I take Hunting for; Not counterfeit, but substitute of War. Rev'rence I bear to thy Command— But, Madam, do not ask me more: The Keys are in a sullen hand, And Porter Silence keeps the dore. Cla. I will not press thee 'gainst thy Mind: But since thy Soul hath manly scope, And that great MARS, and PHOEBUS (joyn'd) Are Masters of thy Horoscope; I will that thou, in habit fit, Come streight to witness with thine Eyes, And by Our Self in Judgment sit Betwixt the Valiant, and the Wise: And I shall then make my Election More by thy vote, than my own Eye; “For more (and chiefly in affection) “Than Gamesters, see the Standers by. Zel. Madam, my part is to be rul'd. To whether stand'st thou most inclin'd? Cla. To him that loves me most. Zel. I should To him that bears the bravest mind. Cla. My liking upon thine depends— (Thus I shall dive into her ends.) Aside. Zel. I'll study the contentment of your Grace— (But (with your leave) mine own in the first place.) Aside. Exeunt, and enter Rifaloro crippled, between two Gyants. Rif. Charitable, loving, sweet, Good fac'd Gyants and discreet, Spight of so many lying Books That paint you Fools with ugly looks. Orlando, and the Knight o'th'Sun, Pay you this good work ye have done; And peaceably dye in your beds, With all your senses in your heads; No Errant Knight, in hideous duel, Be so unconscionably cruel, Armour and all, with Blade in fist, To cleave you down from poul to twist. Squires (inconsiderable Wights) That bind your selves Prentice to Knights, Mark well this doleful Story all, And take Example by my fall: Leave Erranty to those staid Wags Who charge upon their running Nags, Who enter ne're the Lists, though sore Threat'ned above a Month before. To those too, who do there appear, Having nothing to do there: Their Gennets Bells, and their own Gulls: The Peoples laughter, and the Bulls; Leave it— Gy. 1. Leave satyrizing thou. Rif. If I am not abusive, How Shall I in reputation git, And be canoniz'd for a Wit? A Drole, and not satyrical? I never knew but one in all My life, and 'twas a precious Fool, The never-enough-prais'd O Tool! Gy. 1. Sas! Coward, bustle up thy self. Gy. 2. Ah! Brother, do not harm the Elf. Rif. O Gyant of my Guard! into Thy hands I recommend me do. Gy. 2. Then Persian entertain no fear. Rif. I do not, but it will be here. Gy. 2. Shall I heal thee in a trice By Magick? Rif. Hast thou that Device! Gy. 2. See! thou art whole. Rif. Hah! I am well: A Miracle! A Miracle! St. Sacrapant! I run, leap, skip And fly, like Beggar cur'd with Whip. Let not the Doctors know of this, For they will take it much amiss If any's cur'd without their aid; Yet where's the Cure that they have made? The Church hath Doctors too, and they Complain of wrong too in their way: That Emp'ricks Doctors are become, And Doctors Patients now—but Mum. Enter the General. Gen. Horrid confusions do I tread: And Mazes upon Mazes thred In this new Court, where Felisbrave Transported with his Conquests brave, In the pursuit thereof suspends The progress to his amorous Ends. Gy. 1. Rifaloro, wilt thou eat (For I would give thee some choice meat) A salv'ry Leg, or little Wing Of a Camel which we bring? Rif. I would not rob your Grandiships: We say, Like Lettuce to like Lips. This, if you please (having been sick) A Chine of Beef, but not too thick. Gen. Of Rifaloro somewhere near The whining Ecchoes strike my Ear. Gy. 1. Say, shall we post thee through the Air in nimble Egg-shell, to Persia, or in vagrant thimble. They go about to lay hold on him, and he crys out. Rif. No, no, a sober Mule: the Spanish pace On foot, or mounted, not the Wild-goose Chase. Gen. 'Tis he, and those same Gyants dire About to murther the poor Squire: Hold, Cowards! what is this ye do? Gy. 1. Slave, who are we, and what are you? Rif. Hold, tardy succ'rer of distress! These are Gyants of the Peace. Gy. 2. Consider, valiant Knight— Gy. 1. With those That raunt, my Courtesie is Blows. Loose me that I may kill him. Gen. Come, Presumption; but be sure strike home: Those Rebel-Gyants I would scorn to fear, Whose Mountains, to scale Heav'n their Ladders were. Rif. Gen'ral, y'undo me with your wroth, These Worthies are my friends in troth, I tell you true, done more for me they have, Than my good Grandam who is in her Grave, I owe (and shall acknowledge whilst I breath) A thousand favours to their Worships: Sheath Thy Blade, and be advis'd to be more plyant: The Knight's not always sure to kill the Gyant. Gy. 2. This more: Since the dissolving of the Charms, Know, that we Gyants must now lay down Arms. Rif. Well fare thy heart, O Gyant well inclin'd, Holy and sage, and of a peaceful Mind! He tells you true, the Books are clear in't all; To wit, Parismus, Amadis de Gaul, And Cavalier del Phebo—Then 'tis rare, To unpick quarrels, when Laws studied are. Enter a Gentleman called Zelindo. Gent. Prince Floranteo willeth you From Claridiane to shew Unto the Noble Strangers, all This Inchanted Court. Gy. 1. We shall. Mark; and thereof ye shall be show'd Each Rarity, and every Mode. Rif. Are there Complaints? Are there Ambitions? Lyes are there? Are there ill Conditions? Are there Envyings? Are there Words Sweeter than the Tunes of Birds Before one's face, behind the door Back-racket-strokes of a left-handed Moor? Gent. How e're inchanted, Court 'tis still, Here they do lay their sick and ill, Of vast extent their Spittle is: The Quarter of the Grumblers, This. Rif. Bad men they are; yet have they had much wrong; Reaping Rewards, which to the Good belong. Gy. 1. There are the enviouus. Rif. Good Lads those, They kill themselves: Give me such Foes. Gy. 2. There, those, good Fortune puffs. Rif. To morrow I'll talk with them. “Such never can bear sorrow. Gy. 1. There, those, who judge by the successes still. Rif. May all their Actions be condemn'd by Ill. Gy. 1. Here, those, that trust in Princess Favour. Rif. Presumption! bind them to their behaviour. Gy. 2. A swarm of Duenias, there. Rif. With things I will not meddle that have stings. Duenias, Mondongas, Dwarfs and Pages, I leave to bold Plebeian Stages. In Court is sacred ev'ry Lawn, Each setting Beauty, or which now doth dawn, I there adore: Each Tyar a Diadem, A weilded Scepter each shak'd Fan doth seem. I call each Quoif, nay ev'ry Bib, a Cloth Of State, and all for fear I'll take my Oath. Gent. Of Court Diseases talk no more, for there Of others weal we all are sick I fear. Gen. What, not one honest Man in Court then? Gent. Yes, A Thousand in the Spanish Court there is: Whom you shall see in Magick Perspective, Applaud the Golden Age they now retrive. Gy. 1. What is that old short Man we spy? Rif. I take't he writes a Comedy For the Meninas. Gy. 1. Who are they? Rif. A flight of Birds the first of May. Whose chirping Bills (which true Division run) Will flout, and out of Countenance dash the Sun: And I can tell a Secret of them too: But if thou tell't again, By all that's true— Gy. 1. (I tell?) Rif. They would have Husbands, and exact From him a Farse, themselves intend to act On that high day which to the World did give Their Royal Master on whose Beams they live. And four hundred Columns terse, And a conceipt in every verse, And a disdain to each eight feet, And a Sonnet in each sheet, And to every part, they ask: To comply with which huge task, The foresaid Poet by main strength Wire-draws his Play to such a length, That, for a life 'twould serve, of one That does no good under the Sun, Or after whom there's an Advowson, Or before whom there are a Thousan, Or of a Suit in Chancery, Or of a Court Expectancie, Which is th'Eternal of Eternitie. Gent. Four hundred howers last let it, And he who so is wearied wo't, The name of tedious shall git Unto himself, with Clown to boot. For a Festival, set forth To celebrate Phileno's years, By Beliza's Royal worth, Should stop the motion of the Sphears. And merits to last evermore, As do the years it doth adore. Come, see Wonders that surpass, In this inchanted Looking-glass! Relates, as seen in the inchanted Glass, the Festival which the Queen of Spain made at Aran Juez for the Birth-day of the King. Gen. Here view I (with what sweetness blest!) Beauteous Cytherias Nest: And a Babylon of Flow'rs 'Mongst so many pleasant Bow'rs. What an illustrious Pallace fair! Such a Play-fellow the Air Hath not elsewhere: None so nigh And splendid-neighbour hath the Sky. If DRAGONS kept the Golden-Fleece, And Apples of th'Hesperides, In the Fable: In this Truth (Fairer than the Morning's youth) HARAMA (a glib Chrystal Snake) A Girdle to her Fields doth make; TAGUS (a silver Gyant) falls At the feet of her proud Walls. —This Seat To whom belongs it? Zelind. To the Great Shepherd Phileno, who appears Fuller of fame, and Worlds, than years. Whose foot, whose hand (Both) temp'rate in Command) The one an easie yoak doth sit, The other is a prudent Bit. Gen. —Who Leads to this Bow'r of Bliss? Zelind. That new Phoenix of Spain, swathed in fire, Son of himself, and his Great Sire. Fair seav'nteen Springs hath he compleat, Whose understanding is so great, That in his pupillage appears Th'expecience of an hundred years. And in these fields is celebrated That happy day unto the Earth When he receiv'd his Royal Birth, Whence Good Mens hopes, and Bad Mens fears, are dated. Him his two Gallant Brothers follow, Luminaries bright of Spain, Sparks that fly out of his Flame, For they are Stars, if he APOLLO. On whom both Purples we shall view, Of Tiber, and of Danow too; The one his Crosier glorifie; The other raise his Scepter high. The Festival you see doth come From his Illustrious Spouse; in whom (Of two Worlds sitting at the Helms) Earth more perfections sees, than Realms. For but of one Ray of her Hair (Since seldom Kings have Kindred waigh'd) On the meer score that she is fair, A Clasp for two Crowns might be made. Not Lilly of France, but Rose of brown Casteel, that to our Sol shall bring A Spanish Violet to heir his Crown; 'Sted of a Flemish Jesamin. Another equally divine Sheperdesse, that, stead of those Flocks of Swans, which TAGUS shows, Shall reign the EAGLES of the RHINE; Fair Sister of the Master-Swain (Whose parts betwixt respect and fear The proudest merits do constrain To strike their sayls) consorts with her. And of an hundred Nymphs beside (The love and envy of the Sun) Accomplishments so multipli'd, So without earthly Paragon, That not her Train, and less her Eye Fill'd up to the brim with Glory, Either her Royaltie belye, Or leave imperfect Beauties story. Majesty, and sumptuous Cloaths, And the Art to put them on, And variety of those All without comparison. The Valleys sing, the Mountains skip, The Elms and Poplars dance and trip, APRIL himself a part rehearses, And pricks his flow'rs in all the verses. NIQUEA's GLORY (whose strong Spells Even conjure up Impossibles, And Miracles of Wit do muster) Is the Theater's first lustre. The second is the golden Fleece, Which having first begun in Greece, The way to Troy did after find, And ends in Spain with Ilium's fire refin'd. And now the Play without doors is A dull Man's (who his homely Quill T'excuse in part) can tell you this; Without command he writes not ill. Sound a Trumpet. A world of People flock together To be spectators of the sight: And from this Instrument I gather Th'approach of one, and t'other Knight They sound another Trumpet near. To the crown'd Lists.—Let's go, to gain A sight of them: And live this Morn, And rising Sun, and Stars of Spain, Till crippled Time be made their scorn. Exeunt. Cornets. Sound Drums and much Harmony; and Enter at one dore, with a splendid Train, and very brave in Apparel, Prince Claridoro; and if they will they may be arm'd, or leave that till the last Act; and at another dore King Felisbravo, with a splendid Train likewise, &amp;c. and the General, with many others by his side; and let a Curtain be drawn close, Cornets sounding, and on a high conspicuous Throne behind it, let Claridiana and Zelidaura at her right hand, appear, as gloriously clad as may be, and in the fashion they like best; and many Ladies seated upon the Strada, and Floranteo standing at the bottom of the foot pace upon which the Throne is, and the Gyants like two supporters at the Ends thereof; and enter Rifaloro with his Master, and with Claridoro a Servant of his, receiving instructions for something from his Master. Claro. Be sure this part now be well plaid, Ent'ring as if thou wert afraid. Serv. Put no, if, to't, I shall be so. Claro. (By this Invention I shall know If Zelidaura's stay here, be Love, or Curiositie.) Aside. Serv. I go. Claro. This is the War alone Exit Servant. In which I fear to be o'rethrown. Now let the Curtain be drawn back, and each make a profound Reverence to the Queens, and the Queens rise from their seats, as likewise the Ladies, and then the Knights make a Reverence each to other. Company. With what a careless Bravery They One another do survey! Gen. And how compos'd, like honourable Foes, They interchange Salutings before Blows! Cla. Both are gallant. Zel. Gallant, both: Yet I with each am in such wroth, That I to neither side incline, Though I am one's, and t'other's mine. Claro. Hah! Zelidaura on the Throne? She doubtless hath her self made known To Claridiana. Fel. I Am made up of perplexity! The Picture went at first for Zelidaura, TARTARIA's Liege! then represented Laura! A Shepherdess! and now again one seen In Soveraign posture by a Crowned Queen! Once more sleep I bolt upright: When shall I wake, for I do move Like one that's waking, and my sight Equivocates, but not my Love? Who will this glorious Woman prove? Flo. Knights, the Queen stays; and now the last Dice of Fortune both must cast. Dispute, if that untye it not, Your Swords must cut the Gordian-knot. Claridoro takes off his Hat, covers again, and begins. Claro. Madam: (Since you remitted have to words, That which at first were better try'd with swords) I argue thus; By Books Wars Art is taught, And without WISDOM no great thing was wrought. Thus the great Son of Thetis (dire annoy And ten years Plague of miserable Troy) Had his Head arm'd with Prudence more than Steel, Or than his Mother left unarm'd his heel By the learn'd Centaur: Thus King PHILIPS Heir (Who envy'd t'others TRUMPET more than SPEAR) Instructed was, in Aristotles Cell, To understand the World, and then to quell: Thus March'd high CÆSAR through the heart of FRANCE, A Pen in one, in t'other hand a Lance, And, in the Pride of that Success, did show To Brittons bold an armed CICERO. With the same weapon (to abridge disputes) Men conquer Men, with which Men conquer Brutes. Of Beasts, more fierce, more strong, more arm'd are many Than Men; and Barbarous Men as stout as any, More num'rous far. But WISDOM tames the Beast, And Wisest Nations master'd still the rest, Until the Brutish World its own strength knew, And with their Maxims fell their Empires too. 'Tis not the brawny vigour of an Arm, But inward courage (which the heart doth warm) Makes Fortitude: A Life-despising Eye, And (not to conquer, but) to dare to dye. Strength makes it not. If I like strength did want, And met like dangers, I'm more valiant; Because my Soul was of a larger growth, And, when her Second fail'd her, fought for both. He that out-lives his Honour is a Fool: To Cure a Coward send him then to School. But many Valiant have out-liv'd their Fame, For lack of Wit to play an after-game. The Wise weighs all things, who sometimes doth know The Souldiers Praise is to decline a Foe; And (slighting Rumors) his safe glory sums In this, that, “He fights best who overcomes. “Who rashly fights (though he the World amaze) “A valiant Fool will be his best of Praise. When a great Chief his Squadrons up hath led, With others hands he fights, but his own head; Therefore (and fitly) for such valiant wile, His head hath Bays, his Souldiers hands the Spoyl: And when the Sword decides a bloody Fray, Their Hands that one, his Head fights ev'ry day. “Thus only Prowess unto KINGS pertains, “Who ought to wear their Valour in their Brains. As, though ten thousand hands a Palace frame, Yet he, whose Head contriv'd it, bears the Name: Just so a Prince, who acts with others hands, (His own Head steering) Earth and Sea Commands. Upon a Couch the Continent he awes, And from a COUNCIL gives the OCEAN Laws. To hack wild Beasts is not a Soveraign's part: Kings fight not with their Hands but with their Art. I end: In Iron WAR, in PEACE's Down, Their MAXIMS Conquer, and their COUNCILS Crown. A Flourish. With the noise whereof Felisbravo rowses as out of a deep Muse. Fel. (Little of all he said heard I, Such a diversion have I had Of Beauty, like a Rustick clad Sometimes, sometimes with Majesty!) Aside. The SWORD— Takes off his Hat, makes a Reverence, then, covering again, proceeds, speaking to the Throne. —Made Empires; VALOUR guards rich Wisdom's Coffers, As Fear betrays the succours which it offers: He then whom Danger mazes, may for Brain Go to the Camp, he went to School in vain. When a great Leader, a great Rest doth play, Prudence gives aim, but Valour wins the day: And, though he's not oblig'd a Breach to enter The first, his Men must know that he dares venter. If Valour he ne're shew'd, what's truly Wise Will be in him reputed Cowardize. Coward is a Disease bred in the Liver, Which qualifi'd may be, but cured never. Wise Men (and therefore they are Wise) do know How to seem valiant, if they are not so. Who venters farther than is fit, a Sot, A Mad-man may be call'd, but Coward, not. And, who his Valours Proof doth long forbear, Would be thought wise, but will be thought to fear. To dye is very well; but yet to kill, Is more; the Victor is the Victor still. A Souldier boasted to a King his gashes: But give me him (quoth he) that gave such slashes. A valiant Prince, he is his Empire's Wall: Safe without Armies, Terrible to all. Of Realms acquested, These the SWORD did Win, We say, though Policy did most therein. Now, to whose Name the Fecit put you see, The Master-Builder, past all doubt, is he. Council may moderate a Prince that's rash: But who shall fortifie a Spirit lash? High Mettles, like strong Wines, may water bear: But Council's vain, where there's the Traitor FEAR. No King should so presume on Wit, to think To govern Lands with Pens, and Seas with Ink: Better than at a COUNCIL-TABLE, He In TENTS the Land, in CABBINS rules the Sea. Well may a Prince be learned, Perfect none Who wants that best supporter of a Throne. But (for we skirmsh'd have too long with words) Prepare to feel that Scepters live in SWORDS. Trumpets. They Draw: The Queens rise in their Seats, sound a Charge, the Gyants put themselves between the Knights: A Cloud descends, and in it the God of Love with a Nymph, who in a Bason brings many fresh Flowers, and amongst those some withered. Cup. How's this! Suspend your Furies. Zel. Heaven With wonder new lets down the Skies, And crowns the Earth with Prodigies. Cla. The Valianter did much out-go, Zel. That is because you wish'd it so: But the Dispute was ballanc'd even. Cornets. Cup. Claridiana fair and bright, I am LOVE who come to light Thee out of this dark Wood th'art in, And if thou wouldst have him to win Who loves thee best, I'll let thee see Which infallibly is He. But (will or nill) the soveraign Decree of Heav'n doth thus ordain, That he by whom th'art most ador'd, Shall be thy Husband, and thy Lord. Aside. Cla. Since he that was the Valianter Loves me, I'm sure, what need I fear The sentence, but may well submit My Soul and Will to Heaven and It? Thus cut I with my People's grain, Nor can the losing Knight complain. To Cupid. Great LOVE, my Glory 'tis that thou To clear my doubts to Earth wouldst bow: With thee I trust them. Cup. Then, that Man Who these wither'd Flowers can (Put into my hand) recover To pristine state, is thy best Lover. Zel. Who but that stranger Knight there can it be, That came to fight for her, and injure me? Claro. In me what venture is't, if I Do for ZELID AURA dye? Fel. If ZELID AURA I adore, I may venter upon that score. Cup. Noble Claridore, advance. Let him take a dry Flower, and put it in the hand of Cupid, and let it dissolve to ashes. Claro. In Name of the Arabian Queen Let this wither'd Flower grow green. Cup. 'Tis faln to ashes. Cla. What good chance! Zel. What ill luck! Cla. The Victory Stays, with my wishes wings to fly. Zel. O maist thou ne're victorious prove! Cup. Glorious Inconnu, move. Fel. I deliver thee this same In Claridiana's name. This Flower too falls to dust. Cup. Dust it is, and transitory. Cla. This is Treason. Zel. This is Glory. Rif. Into my Countrey I will carry A Receipt so necessary, To prove all Men what ever Lyars, Who blind poor credulous Women with false Fires. Cup. Brave Floranteo, draw thou near. Cla. Avaunt! Cup. If he in worth and birth is peer Unto the proudest of them all, in vain, Claridiana, dost thou him distain. Draw near— Flo. In name of fair, but merciless Claridiana (who contemns Much Love, and little Happiness) Receive this Flow'r. Cup. See how it gems, Smiles, and recovers! Noble Youth, Loe, Love in person doth reward thy truth! Offers to join them; and Claridiana flyes back. Cla. I'll lose my life first. Cup. Thou hast said Thou't obey Heaven; and Heav'n will be obey'd. All. Live Floranteo. Cla. Live (say I) Claridiana, and All dye. Cup. To Floranteo 'longs Arabia's Throne: Give him the joy, and homage every one. Cla. Is Heav'n become a cousener too? What ill Example!—Trait'rous Crew!— Citizens. Of Floranteo Wife thou art, And he our King. Fel. Dare none to start From his Allegiance. Claro. Cowards stay, In her defence do I this Sword display. Enter the Servant of Claridoro, as in a great fright. Serv. Claridoro without peer, Mixest thou in Quarrels here, When in Tartary they are All in confusion, all in War? For Zelidaura being self exil'd In uncouth Mountains, and in Forrests wild, Nor chusing any Husband out, Her Subjects to uncrown her go about. Thou then (since of her Blood thou art) Draw thy Sword to take her part, And thy faith, and prowess high In that just Cause alone employ: If thou linger— Claro. 'Tis enough. Fel. Heav'ns! I shall be sure accurst If my Sword aid her not the first, For an eternal Love, and tough Revenge, for Cause declared now, Me furiously into that War doth throw. Exit in a Rage. To Rifaloro. Gen. Let's follow Felisbrave. Rif. You know I trundle Under you Gen'ral—By my Persian faith This sweet inchanted Creature is a Bundle, And Nosegay, of Aurora's. Claro. There's my path To serve you Madam: So Love wills, that I Who dye his Martyr, should your Souldier dye. Cla. What an unlook'd for Change! Zel. The Rout (Heav'ns) in my absence, without doubt, Is blown up into Tumults—Queen and Laws Of Hospitality, perdon the Cause. Now no more curious Fooleries, in old And valiant Earnest let the World behold Arm'd Zelidaura, and Tartaria feel The dire effects of her provoked Steel. Exeunt Zelidaura and Roselinda. All. For Floranteo Victory! Flo. Villains, in your Throats ye lye. Citiz. To Floranteo, Madam, yield your Hand, Or all Arabia falls from your Command. Cla. Coward and Raskal-Heard, that shall be try'd. This is my Hand—Who? who, will give the Bride? Approach that dare—See, Traitors (whom my breath Draws. Should drive like chaff) It holds the Key of Death! And Floranteo draws in defence of her. Flo. Retire: His Sword for whom ye mutiny Defends Claridiana. Citiz. Enemy To thine own Heart! Thy self, and all the Gods Thou dost oppose, provoking their just Rods. Flo. Insolent Varlets— All. Kill him. Flo. I had rather Serve her, than have her. Cla. O, my deep-read Father, Permit'st thou this? Now save me by thy Art: Now is the moment. Flo. Madam, Take good Heart. He drives them out, and returns to Claridiana. The Cloud's dispers'd; y'are safer in my Guard Then if the Stars all own'd you for their ward. Trumpets. Exeunt. The End of the second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE THIRD ACT. Enter Aurelio, and others, as receiving with joy, Zelidaura, with her Roselinda, in Tartaria. Zel. This is t'entrap me; well, my Foot Within the City I'll not put, Till a full Tryal make it clear, Whether things are, as they appear. Aur. Great Madam, 'tis enough the Realm Thy secret wand'ring did incline To murmur at thee, and repine; Our Pilot absent from the Helm. But, to be censur'd once disloyal, TARTARIA merits not. What Tryal Would'st thou have more, than the Applause And Joy, which thy Return doth cause; Both this, which meets thee on the Bounds; And that, which from yon Walls resounds? Though, as to lighting us, some time, Abscence eclips'd thee to our Clime; Not as to Influence; for, to Faith, No Back at all a SOV'RAIGN hath. Since the false news did thee no harm, And now thy Beams TARTARIA warm; This Errour's debtor we remain, For giving us our Queen again, Enter the City (we implore) Nor let thy Anger cost it more. Zel. First, in that Rural Palace hid with Bow'rs, I'll rest—But what's this noyse? Rif. Help, Heav'nly Pow'rs! Trumpets. Within a great noyse of Swords. The World sinks with their stroaks. Zel. Make hast, hast make. Enter Felisbravo and Claridoro fighting, and much People endeavouring to part them, and with them the General, Rifaloro, and a Captain. Fel. Now, on thy treach'ry will I take A full Revenge. Claro. Now, on thy Head Shall be reveng'd what I have bled. Zel. Rule me those Swords, two lives defend, Which th'Owners prodigally spend. (O Heavens!)— Fel. Leave, of all his Train, Not one alive. Gen. Cowards, in vain Ye muster Regiments of Hares: The more you are, the more your fears. Aur. What Fury! Tide encounters Tide. (Vain Labour!) Rif. I am by thy side: None of your petty Clownlings, we; The Bombast of a Comedie. Zel. Part them, I say. The two that fight Are Claridoro, and the Knight Of the Picture. Rif. There's thy score— Rifaloro hits one of them. No fencing it with Rifalore. The Knights are parted. Fel. That, e're so many People came, I kill'd him not; I blush for shame. Claro. That I, by these should hind'red be From killing him, it vexes me. Capt. Both are hurt. Zel. The Stranger bear First to be Cur'd: And, Officer, Quarter him in the Mansion Of Laura's Father, Coridon. Capt. I shall. Zel. Prince Claridoro too (Whose Life I fear less of the two) Place in an equal Quarter near. Aur. I shall. Zel. Before you go (d'ye hear!) Clap in such wise on both a Guard That they perceive not their way barr'd. I would secure them each from either, Yet not be seen to do it neither. The Captain comes to Felisbravo, and Aurelio to Claridoro. Aside. And how (O Love) how shall I know, Whether he fought for me, or no? Capt. Please you to come where they may cure you? Fel. The wound is nothing I assure you. Capt. By your Life (Sir) consider't more. Aur. Prince, reply not, y'are hurt sore. Claro. A scratch, believe't. Aur. You'll find it none: Howe're, the Queen will have it done Claro. A spark of pity now from Her! Then look for quarter from a Murd'rer. Fel. Captain, how far from hence to Court? Capt. Your Cure (Sir Knight) doth more import You, than that knowledge. Fel. To secure Zelidaura, is my Cure. Capt. What Faith a groundless lye will win! And O! how late it is call'd in? But, come along, and you shall see How well this Care may spared be. Fel. To my Revenge I do prefer The greater sweet of serving her. Exeunt Felisbravo and Captain. Aur. Come, Prince. Claro. 'Tis so: Now, Madam, I do find You (who ev'n then are cruel, when y'are kind) Because from Life, I sue out a divorce, To punish me will make me live perforce. Exeunt Claridoro and Aurelio. Rif. Do they bear them Pris'ners hence? Gen. Pris'ners? I'll follow my dear Prince, Resolving by his side to dye. Rif. That's not for me; and yet I lye; For I (to give my self my due) Do whiff the smoak of Honour too. Exit General, and Rifaloro offers to follow him, but is staid by Roselinda. Zel. Stop that Servant. Ros. Gentleman, I come to call you. Rif. Virgin, can You pick out of this face, and meen, No higher Title? Well 'tis seen You know me not, you don't in troth, You don't—How low our Market go'th?

Where's de Froe? Rifaloro turns, takes off his Hat and falls at her Feet. Zel. Approach. Rif. Now let me never stir, What diff'rence 'twixt the Sun, and hir? A Clustre of ripe Stars she is: Let me that hand, adoring, kiss;— That hand, by which the Lillies brown appear, And the Crystal is not clear, Lac'd with Saphyr, tagg'd with shell In which the Orient Pearl doth dwell: Give me that pretty foot, which goes Knitting sweet flow'r with Ivory Toes, But none so short as It; for thine Is Breviat of a Jesamine: Give me— Zel. Withdraw, and let him stay. Roselinda goes aside. —Art thou the Stranger's Servant? Say. Rif. I am, nor of him do complain. Zel. Is he so good? Rif. So bad; w'are fain At ev'ry turn to be made friends: But seldome in this World meet Ends: Ill Masters have good Servants, Good Are answered with Ingratitude. Zel. What Place? Rif. An Office of great trust. Zel. How great? Rif. His Mute. Zel. His Mute? I must Confess, that's not for a Fool. Rif. There's an Exception to each Rule. For (let me tell you) I do blend 'um, Holding the latter in Commendum. Zel. Thy Conceipts like me past expression. Rif. 'Tis incident to our Profession That (let it miss, or let it hit) We Fools are off'ring still at Wit. Zel. Who is thy Master? Rif. He is one Whose Countrey I'll to you make known, His merit, humour, disposition, But his Name, on no condition. Zel. And why his Name wilt thou not tell? Rif. For doing of a Miracle: That once this saying may be true, A Servant told not all he knew. Zel. 'Tis not worth thanks to hide his name, When all things else thou dost proclaim. Rif. Of the old Apple a new slice! Mother Eve's inquisitive Vice! His name? in troth it may not be. Zel. Hola! Rif. Why call you? Zel. Thou shalt see. Enter Aurelio. “With a base mind, what gentle courses “Cannot perswade, that Rigour forces. Aur. Ordein your pleasure. Zel. (Anger me!) Hang presently— Rif. Upon a Tree Say not, by thine Eyes; for I Shall then prevent the Rope, and dye Of the unkindness. Zel. Away take him. Layes hold of him, and he struggles. Rif. In earnest is't? Zel. A pattern make him To Fools, who shall pretend to hold hereafter A Secret—(My Intreaties made a laughter! I, pray in vain!) Rif. By this good day I think thou know'st not how to pray. In fine, I must be hang'd. Zel. Thou must (Without his name) forthwith be truss'd. Rif. Then drive on, Cart, Note World, a Woman hung A Man, because he held his Tongue. March, March. Zel. (For once it shall be told, A Woman could from knowing hold A Secret, which she dyes to know; withall, Which a Man says, he'll dye, before she shall—) Aside. Leave him at large—What Countrey-man Aurelio goes aside. 'S thy Master? Rif. He's a Persian: For whom great Mars bids make already All his tryumphal Charets ready. Zel. Is he high-born? Rif. And so discreet, Valiant, bountiful, and sweet In his deport, that he's the great Idea of a Prince Compleat. Zel. Is't Felisbravo? Rif. Unto thee Is that Name known? No, 'tis not He. 'S precious! that Royal Prodigy Above the bounds of Man doth fly. Zel. And what's his bus'ness? To this Coast What Wind brings him (for thou know'st?) Rif. O Women! Zel. Speak, go not about The bush. Rif. Then, turn me inside out, Seraphical Examiner. They say there's in Tartaria here A Mad-cap Queen, that kembs you wyre, And wears a Helmet for a tyre; Who, 'sted of a wide Vardingale And reverend Apron, puts on Mayl, And glitt'ring Arms, in which are writ The valiant Deeds she did commit; Who nothing but the Spear, and Rest, And Pouldron, minds; She hoops her breast With Brass, and her long fingers fair, The deserts of the Needle are. A mischief take the Woman! Let her Resign to Men (whom it suits better) Incampings: Let her Kerchers hem, Leave hemming in of Troops to them. If a Spider cross her sight, Let her take a famous fright; And purse her Mouth when she says, Man, Or Husband, like the Nimphs of Spane. Let her tremble at a Rat, More than it doth at a Cat. “She, for a Beauty who would pass, “Must be as nice as Venice glass; “And, if one hold his hand up, wink, “For fear he brain her with a pink. In fine, to see this Queen we came: When a Knight (Rival of his Fame) His Fury would have kill'd: They both Lie hurt, and I am so in wroth With this Man Woman, Angel-Devil, (Who to the Sun would scant be civil) That could I light upon her Grace, I'd tell her roundly to her face, Spin Highness, Spin (as good as you have spun) For y'are a Woman, not an Amazon. Zel. (He serves me right—) Who sent him? Rif. (No, you sed You'd have me hang'd)—He came of his own head. For he hath Valour, Birth, and All With which a Queen in Love should fall: And I (his Servant) shall not bate Much of a Countesse for my Mate. I know too in the World a QUEEN (I name her not, but) she hath been Late disinchanted, for which pains Such favours upon Him she rains, That—But I stop— Zel. Say, prethee, does he love? Rif. Is he a Brute? Zel. And is he lov'd? Rif. You move A curious Question—This (shall I be free?) Is a graft too of the forbidden Tree. From me no more is to be got, And therefore (pray you) press me not. Good faith, 'twere much more like a Friend To hang me, as you did intend. Zel. This one thing wilt not let me know? Rif. Pray, why should you desire it so? Zel. Only to keep it secret still. Rif. Forbear to know it, and you will. Zel. How mainly thou art giv'n to scoff! It is not noble to put off With a light jest a serious suit: Rif. No? as great Men as I will do't. But come (since you will have the truth) He is a Man much lov'd by many, Yet one of such a curious tooth, That in his life he ne're lov'd any. White Hands black Eyes, curl'd Looks, have no more force On him, than Physick hath on a dead Horse. From some dry Mother-in-law the Man did learn Not to relent—He? He hath no concern, Cannot discourse of love, though in his prime, Though on all other Theams his tongue's a Chime, Though none so drest, none dances so, none pours Himself so out; for He's a rock of Flow'rs. Aside. Zel. A Knight that's so accomplish'd, not To love, appears to me a knot. I must undo it by some Art: For at this secret hangs a Heart. To Rifaloro. Pleas'd me thou hast exceedingly: And I unthankful shall not be. Rif. I kiss thy foot, and am thy slave. Zel. Here me Aurelio, take this Knave To prison. Rif. Me to prison? Zel. Yes, For being a Blab. Rif. Ah! Traiteress, Horrible Inquisitrix, Are these thy thanks? and do'st thou fix The name of Blab upon me too? O! take by me example, you That are Gallants, you that love: Thus do Ladies thankful prove. He is carried away to Prison. Ros. Should your Highness be more cruel Than you are to this sweet Jewel; Never was't so well bestow'd, Or so like a Mercy show'd. Exit Roselinda. Zel. Dissolv'd in Tears, and languishing delight, The whisp'ring Fountain is a tale of Love, The Rosie Morn, inam'ring at first sight, Sweet Philomela's Oraisons doth move; The smiling Flow'r, the tender peeping Bud, April importunes with soft show'rs; the Dove Lives vow'd to everlasting Widdowhood, Temple of Loyalty, and Soul of Love. Love grasps both Globes: Love all below inspires: Love guides with constant change the sphears above: Mars feels Loves darts, Apollo feels Loves fires, Ev'n He that hurls the thunder, yields to Love. All these to me no warrant; whose intent Is not to vouch, but make a Precedent. Exit Zelidaura. Enter Claridiana in Mans Apparel, with her Floranteo, and Florinda Lady of Honour to her. Cla. Leave haunting me, and leave thy vain And impertinent desire; The more thou do'st of me complain, The more's the honour I acquire: For (credit me) I more approve That all the World should be my Foe, Than I defended by thy Love: It is a debt I would not owe. Though Heav'n with plaguing me tire never, I hope yet it will use me better Than (to compleat my Plagues) that ever I should be my Tormentors debtor. Return, and let Arabia gather Her Rebel-Armies in thy Name: Be kindling there seditious, rather Than kindled here with amorous flame. The cause of this disguise you see, Is, that your self and me, You now no more may vex, But look on me as one of your own Sex. Be gone, provoke me not too far, This field presume not to transgress; For, if my Eyes such Murth'rers are, My Hand will be a greater Murtheress. Flo. Bellona, armed with the Sun; That Conquest which thy Face hath sure, Some hazzard in thy Sword may run, Although its temper too be pure. For Hearts ignoble (which your sweet Majestick Eye cannot command To lie down trembling at your Feet) Reserve the anger of the Hand. Not revilings so well spoke, Not the pain with which I'm stung, Not thy scorns can me provoke; “For want of luck is not a wrong. Nor merit I to be exil'd From the dear place which thou art in, Though scorn'd, tormented, and revil'd; For, nor is want of luck a sin. T'obey, I do not ask thee now High Heav'ns by thee despised will. But that (abhorring Me) yet thou Would'st give me leave to Love Thee still. Nor do I so much thank the Gods That they were pleas'd to vote thee mine, As that from all the World the odds They judg'd to me of being thine. But, since thy hate I constant find, This Cruelty hath op'd mine Eyes To see that all the Stars are blind, And thou than Heav'n it self more wise. Return into thy Kingdom free; There, at the Altar, I'll refuse thee: Let not Arabia lose Thee, It is enough that I do lose thee. Forreign Succours thou need'st none: Return, thou hast (if thou canst see) Champion enough in me alone, And in thy selfe a Victory. Cla. On thee I lay not all the fault, For (Floranteo) without doubt, That, against which I bend my thought, Heav'n is too prone to bring about. Now, as for Beauty, I pretend To none, and, if I had such lot, My Beauty's Conquests should extend To something that I hated not. That thou art object of my Hate To impute's erroneous vanity, Unto thy being unfortunate, And not unto my knowing thee. Makes a streak on the ground. Step not an Inch beyond this line. For, should the World arm all agin me, And all the Elements combine, I have my Victories within me. Flo. Most Beautiful, Illustrious, Generous, Divine Claridiana, whom t'excel Self-Rival'd Nature being ambitious, With flesh and blood found it impossible. New Phoenix of Arabia, Miracle Greater than She, who in of Her Self lyes, Dies when she rises, rises when she dyes. Celestial Princess, able to make Wars Out of the private stock of thy Perfections: (For thou might'st press full Regiments of Stars, Would'st thou but give thy foot those bright directions.) Advance, thy Beauty's Royal Standard spred; Beat up thy Drums in Hearts that freedom plead; Give out Commissions under white and red To kill and slay, to burn, and to make prize, And let thy Foes look Armies in thy Eyes. See, how thy fugitive feet, by calling Strangers To thy assistance, steal the Victory Thy face (if shew'd) would gain, dispersing dangers More than the Gorgons Head! that sparkling Eye, The whiteness of that Hard, without a Blow, All that contrast with thee, must overthrow In a celestial War of Fire and Snow. Beauty pretends not warring with a Sword, But with a gentle look, or a kind word; To be robustious, furious, warlike, are Not Graces, but distortions of the Fair. A scorn that sweetly balsoms when it wounds, A word that striking courteously rebounds, An am'rous Frown; these tye Men to their duty With cords; for “A perswading War is Beauty. Cla. Thou seest I ask no Prince my part to take (How brave so e're) none such my Champion make. But beg (how meetly!) Zelidaura's Aid, A Maiden Queen to right a Crowned Maid. She (the illustrious Bulwark of her land, And Mistress of a Soul white as her Hand) Disdains her Name, and her Heroick Sail To such a trifle as a Man should vail. Since then the Tartars unrevolted are, And now in Peace, though always prone to War, Their Martial Spirits let her exercise, T' undoe a wrong which loud for Vengeance crys: I, by a Woman or by none, will rise: Too proud, my life (if sav'd b'a Man) to own, Or with my Freedom to redeem my Throne. To be robustious, fierce, and arrogant, They are not Beauties proper Arms, I grant; For her smooth rigidness her slack comptroll, Cloath not with steel the body, but the soul. I grant, Cheeks swoln with choler have no hooks: That no temptations are in furious looks: For the Brest's inward softness (without doubt) Is Beauty's soul, which seasons that without. But, ceas'd Semiramis, to be a Dame, Penthasilia ceas'd she to inflame, (Their Helmets off) because, when on they were, This Hectors Sword, That shook Achilles Spear? Discreet, prompt, active, gallant, happily Are they entayl'd upon Deformity? And evermore must Beauty bear the taunt Of luckless, cowardly, and ignorant? To a discreet and an obedient Lover Her self in her own shape let her discover, (“For when all's done, to pierce a Wiseman's breast “Beauty's the sharpest sword.) But for the rest, Who vex, who cross me, them, not with a white, But armed Hand, I'll take, kill, burn, in fight. Here 'tis, that Beauty quits her native charms; And plays the Souldier with those borrowed Arms. Shall I those People that would suck my blood, Slay with a Lady's Weapon? (That were good:) And Rebels, shall so sweet a death o'rewhelm, As by my Beauty? No, the impious Relm Shall rue their work—What talk'st thou of my Face! It is my Sword must right me in this Case. My Hands must quell those that against me rise: For other are the Conquests of my Eyes. Flo. Peace: Zelidaura comes. Cla. I blush; although Transform'd Claridiana who can know? Flo. Thy Beauty in such Characters is writ, That a dull Eye may soon discypher it. Cla. By thee (who art my shadow) me it may: Back therefore, Floranteo. Flo. Though thou play The Tyranness, I am thy subject still: Then cease thy Anger if I do thy Will. Exit Floranteo. Claridiana and Florinda remain. Florin. In her superlative perfections, Thou wilt see a peerless Dame. Cla. Of her Beauty faint Reflections Are rendred by the Glass of Fame. Enter to them Zelidaura, Aurelio, Roselinda, and others. Zel. Here leave us. Ros. Madam, are you well? Zel. I ayl nothing Roselind— Aside. What new Disease!—I cannot tell, This disinchanted Queen is wond'rous kind, Or wond'rous grateful—Thought, thou 'rt not my Friend— To her Train. Leave me thou too—we would be left. Ros. A weight Hangs there—and, it that Heart beneath it bend, Believe me it must needs be great. Exit Train. Zel. What tyrannous resentments move Such monstrous billows in my brest? Jealous am I, before I love? And before I fear, opprest? If Claridiane is Queen Of Araby, what makes she here? Is it to see only, unseen? That much unlikely doth appear. If for the Love she bears the Stranger, ill Did he to leave her, though worth spurr'd him on: But, if he reign'd as King in her good will, She did as good as bid him get him gone. —Fool, Fool, to be concerned so In wrongs her Beauty doth sustain; When all the pity I can show Is not enough for my own pain. Flor. Approach, what fear'st thou? Cla. Strange confusion! —Whom see I? Zel. Yes, I know that Fame, Claridiana knows Zelidaura when she sees her, and Zelidaura knows her. And that gate too— Cla. 'Tis no delusion; She, whom I saw in a course case, Was Zelidaura— Zel. My suspition's true; The wrong'd Claridiana doth pursue The Stranger whom she loves—Downflames— Cla. Troy's ours: My Name but sounded, brings me all her Pow'rs. To Zelidaura. Couragious Queen, bright honour of thy kind, At these tryumphant Feet thy Slave's inclin'd. Falls at her Feet. Zel. Rise, and inform us what thou art. Cla. I am (Fam'd Zelidaura) an Arabian Knight, Who beg thee drown'd with pity in the name Of my dread Mistress, brought into sad plight By Rebels—If thou art the blew-ey'd Maid, Who is the Deity of War; Aid, Aid, Injur'd Claridiana— Zel. (Part well plaid!) Aside. Cla. In her dear Countrey, in her Throne replant Claridiana; then thou shalt not want New Decades to thy Story, and give Fame (Who loves to sing thy Praises) a large Theam. Arm; let thy valour freeze th'Usurper's veins: Nor let thy hand kill less, than thy disdains. Thy Beauties in their dazeled faces shine, And teach thy Sword to conquer, though 'tis thine. On Spanish Gennet hang 'twixt Earth and Air: Nor Mars, but Sol, be now the God of War. To Cowards, and to Valiant, fatal prove: Making those dye for fear, as these for love. Aside. Zel. In flatt'ries wrapt, her purpose close she bears: How well they 're call'd, the poison of the Ears! Another now (thus jealous) would be thought In love, but I'm not guilty of that fault, Yet here are sighs would make me think I were, And never lye, did so like truth appear. I'll answer coldly, till I know if War Be in her land, or love do make't on her. If Treason drave her thence, without delay My conqu'ring Flags in her Cause display. But, if (a frantick Lover) she pursue The gallant Stranger, I will make her rue She e're came hither; and upon them both (Though I should dye for't) wreak my burning wroth. Cla. What is your answer? Zel. Is there, did'st thou say, Such a Rebellion in ARABIA? Cla. Madam, there is. Zel. And did that Queen send thee To make request for succours unto Me? Cla. 'Tis very certain. Zel. And as certain, this, That she doth hope them from me? Cla. Madam, 'tis. Zel. And for my Answer wert thou bid to stay? Cla. Madam, I was. Zel. La Reine Sauisera. Exit very stately. Cla. How's this? An Answer how unlike her Fame? Are these the Actions that cry up her Name? Is this that they call Manly? This to be Invincible? What an Indignitie! Upon how slight an Errand Fame will go? And how it gathers like a Ball of Snow! When I suppos'd her Valour would burst out, And sow with Squadrons all my fields about, To reap, for our two heads, a twofold Crown, Of Gold for mine, of Laurel for her own: When the two sweetest things Earth can afford I made account to owe unto her Sword, Revenge and Empire; paying me in brief The common Wages of a light belief, She answers (neither brave, nor pitiful, Nor courteous, but pitifully dull) She'll think of it. And if her Bowels yearn'd Not now, will she with thinking be concern'd? What shall I do? Flor. Sue to some King, and chuse Him such a King, as you did most abuse. If you obliged Any heretofore, Take heed of him upon that very score. How well your Entertainment she doth quit! Cla. Her rustick weed bely'd not her Soul yet. “The worst of Foes are thankless Friends; for those “One ne're did good to, are at worst cheap Foes. Ingratitude is cruel. Seek I must (I see) to my wise Father, though unjust. Ah Zelidaura, thou hast a Man's Heart, Because untouch'd with sense of Woman's smart! Exeunt. Enter Claridoro with his Arm in a Scarf. Claro. From this deep Vale, with horrour crown'd, Whose bottom not the Stars can sound, I breath up sighs no less profound. Where, if hard trees, and harder stones, Hear my moans; Never again Will I to cruel Womankind complain. Silence not still respect implies: For he from whom, when rack'd he lies Nothing is wrung, Slights his Tormentor whilst he holds his tongue. What need of silence hath respect? It looks to me as if the Flame Were held a shame, Which all the Care is how not to detect. Here, here, let me let loose my groans, Let the great Bell out be rung: Here safely all my Love at once Unload thy self into my tongue. If she should overhear it, Crime 'twere none; Faith is alive, but hope is dead and gone. If our Predecessors Passions Had been regulated thus, Beauties new Fortifications Had not been rais'd against us. For who could take a just offence At an humble Patience, At a true Hearts silent aking, Or ev'n a suit presented quaking? Zelidaura Star divine That dost in highest Orb of Beauty shine, Pardon'd Murd'ress, by that Heart It self which thou dost kill, and coveted smart: Though my walk so distant lyes From the Sun-shine of thine Eyes, (Into sullen shaddows hurl'd, To lye here buried to the World) 'Tis the least reason of my moan, That so much Earth is 'twixt us thrown. 'Tis absence of another kind Grieves me: For, where y'are present too, Love's Geometry doth find I have ten thousand Miles to you. “'Tis not absence, to be far; “But, to abhor, is to absent. “To those, who in disfavour are, “Sight it self is Banishment. But I love thee with all my heart, Whom therefore thou canst never fly; Since, in whatever place thou art, Th'art present to my Fantasie. As th'Optick's turn'd, the Object comes and goes: Disdain no presence, Love no absence knows. Custom of Ills is poor relief, It only stands on the defence: The faint Compounder of a Grief After the first violence. Nor hath that place in a new Wound, And my Wound is ever new, And ev'ry day is more profound, And ev'ry moment festers too. Only one Woe (for't were a Crime) I never can be guilty of: To love her less than at this time, Or not to love only to love. Nor would I quench the fire in which I dye, To be the light of any other Eye. Enter Zelidaura in a Rustick Habit. Zel. The wounded Knight I come to see: Let no one stop me—Is that he? Claro. Who is so out of fashion, as to look Upon a Man whom Fortune hath forsook? What a sparkling Shepherdess! (Here may be more than I yet guess.) Zel. Ay me! 'Tis Claridoro, This. Claro. Through her disguise how fair she is! 'Tis Zelidaura (for my sight Hath found her out by her own light) But 'tis a Happiness, and I In that may ev'n mistrust my Eye. Possible in nature is it, That to me can be this visit? Or, so beside my self am I, To think ought mine that is Felicity? Zel. He knows me, but I'll face him down I am not I: But he is such a Clown He'll not believe me, should I swear it: Aside. Claro. Why might not my immortal passion merit, And force thus much, from Her? It might do so, If I were not a Man made sure to Woe: Nor would it the first glorious tryumph prove O're scornful Beauty, by submissive Love: Though I do mainly doubt it, and should say 'Twere a great wonder, were it true: I'll pay My truth her wages with believing 'tis: And so deceive my self into a Bliss. Addresses himself to her. Shepherdesse, whose Sheep-Walks reach From China's Wall to the Muscovian Beach; Who to a thousand Flocks do'st look, And rul'st them with a Golden Hook; Whom Title, Beauty, Wit, combine To render in all points divine: Humane only toward me, Nor that till thou these hurts didst see; As if (to dye) that I had need By other hand than thine, to bleed. Such pity Zelidaura keep: For all these Wounds I long may live: A Foe's Weapon cuts not deep: Pity that, a Friend doth give. For this high Grace, thou now bestow'st— Aside. Zel. (Were't meant, I see it were not lost. But yes: It were an Ill-plac'd Boon On one, that can believe't so soon) To Him. Where's any Zelidaura here? Dost thou a simple Body jeer? 'Tis well— Claro. You over act it Zelidaura: Zel. Zelidaure not me, I Laura Am, the Daughter of thine Host. Thou, little, Zelidaura know'st. A Majesty so proud, so grave, To come and visit thee? do'st rave? With me thou double-wrong'st her Grace; In her Discretion and her Face. I'm pitifull a little, much at home: To see thee (hurt) on these two scores I come. Claro. Thou art my Health, when Health's away, And of my Hopes the only stay. Zel. Thou 'rt of the Sect of Hopers than? Claro. Fair ZELIDAURA, if you can, In this sweet truth, or errour, dye let me. Zel. Either I am not, or will not be she. Claro. Goddess of snow, fair Copy of the Sun, Ecclipsing this, and making that look dun; Whose piercing sight (predominant in Souls) Two Globes of Light, two Sphears of Beauty, rowls; 'Bout which ten thousand flutt'ring Cupids swarm, And sindge those wings they there presum'd to warm: Whom with one gracious smile if thou requite, Thou kill'st with Life, and strik'st them blind with Light. Thou, from whom (arm'd with steel and love are sent Thy Billets into every Element (Inraged) (rending.) and Adorning (Fair) The Earth with Stars, with Cannon-shot the Air. The Woods (from which all other Sun is shut) (With Lilly Hand, with odoriferous foot, (Speeding unerring Shafts, recruiting Bow'rs) Thou robb'st of Beasts, and pay'st again in Flowers. Celestial ZELIDAURA, fair Comptrol Of all that share an understanding Soul, (For 'tis the least of Praise thy Beauty boasts To trample outward force, and vanquish'd Hoasts.) Though, 'twas the dream of one that ill did rest To fancy gentle pity in thy Brest, (The wrack of Hearts, and temple of a Saint Whose Walls can boast not one reliev'd Complaint.) It was a vanity my Love brought forth, When I consider'd that, and not thy worth. Nor dare I so much wrong that noble Passion, To think it might not merit a Compassion, Though not return: Yet, Bliss on any score, Which knock'd at mine, it seems mistook the dore. For when Thou com'st (and then That comes) to Me BLISSE, is not Bliss, nor ZELIDAURA, She. I know thee not (let not thy choler rise) For I believe Thee more than my own Eyes. Zel. Alack! alack! much loss of Blood Hath turn'd his Brain, and makes him wood. Claro. O Love (thou well maist be call'd blind) The happier Stranger came she not to find? O Heav'ns! with this suspition I do pass To be envious and base. But if blind Love made me conceit Fondly of her, as to me: Stranger, the wonder's not so great, If I think meanly of her, as to thee. Here me, Laura. Zel. Now't's too late: Poor Soul, thou talk'st at a strange rate! Besides, I do not like thee half so well, Since I perceive thy thoughts so vastly swell. Exit Zelidaura flying away from him. Claro. Why (ungrateful) fly'st thou me, And seek'st my Rival? Was disdain (O Heav'ns!) too little, without Jealousie? Envy, was't not sufficient to complain? Kill'd with anothers Happiness? Suffic'd not for a Wretch his own distress? I took another Bliss for mine (A wise Conceit!) That harms themselves cannot my Wits refine! That from my ill, that good I could not get! That I should, not be able To make some use of being miserable. My Soul shall follow thee, Too fleet for me: For from my Soul I'm sure thou canst not go, And I know all the paths that lead to Woe. O Life, with Sorrows rife, Only to Misery thou art a Life! Exit. Enter Felisbravo with his Arm in a Scarf. Fel. Lash'd by the Winds, the Ocean raves, and craves To be a Star, and not an Element: The Winds cry Freedom from their horrid Caves, Not clogs of Mountains can their scape prevent. The Mountains crack; the crouded Air upheaves The Pillars of the Rocking Firmament: For none, to that which smart or loss receives, Forbids a sigh, a tear, or a lament. I only (a dead mark of Fortune's spight) Stand on the highest pinacle of Grief Firm as a Diamond, silent as Night. O Smart well disciplin'd, without Relief For a poor Lover to support his woe! So much a sorrow doth to custom owe. Immortal, doubtless, is the thing Which me doth pain, And that again Which doth eternally remain From a Celestial Cause must spring. My Soul is short as unto Me, 'Tis Epigram: But, Madam, to the World I came Eternal, as to loving Thee, For unto thee, all Soul I am. The greater torment I sustain, The less I wou'd My days conclude; For, dying to be out of pain, Is the Cowards fortitude. Grant, I should (my pain to cure) Suffer Smart Break Thee, Heart; Can I another Heart procure To love with, when thou broken art? But little skill in love thou hast, Who e're thou art that think'st or Bliss, Or Valour is, In dying for't; since, Life once past, Neither Love, nor his Pangs, last. Therefore would I alive remain, 'Cause (dead) impossible 'twould prove To obtain Either more Love to cause sweet pain, Or more time in which to love. I do not with presumptuous Heart Value my self on Fortunes Frown: He, that's o'rethrown For want of taking his own part, Gets no Honour by being down. The Man that merits not good Fortune, If he complain, Is not in vain Complain'd of: For, in due misfortune, To murmur, is t'offend again. I hold it for a wither'd Bays. For which I nothing have to show, But that proud Fortune is my Foe: A poor it is, and heartless praise, Which to my misery I owe. Heav'nly Zelidaura, I Am my own Confusion: And blame not thee, my Misery Being ow'd unto my self alone. From others pity I could ne're Extract a Bliss; nor fit Imagin it, That others should the sorrow bear, When I the folly did commit. In thy regard, alive or dead, I cannot be Comforted: For, whil'st I live, thou 'rt lost to me; And, dead, I lose the loving thee. When shall these Eyes behold the light For which I Languishing, dye? When?—But what needs corporeal sight? Love can see without an Eye. That I, a Persian, should Adore the Sun, Is no wonder; But, in some Pool 'tis safest done, Or when a Cloud 'tis under. For, my best Sun, if Thee I should see, 'Twould scorch me with the heat, 'twould blind me with the Ray, Unless (as thee I once survay'd) 'Twere in thy Picture's cooler shade; Or thus, by strength of fancy, when ev'n that's away. Stands or lyes down, with his Eyes fixt towards the door, as upon the dear object. Enter Zelidaura in the Habit of a Shepherdess. Zel. The Patient stays in pain, make room, A goodyer take you, let me come. To Him. Will your Worship be drest now? Fel. The Chyrurgioness art thou? Zel. Yes, and might be too the wound. Fel. Thou might'st indeed: For the most sound, If with this object he did meet, Might dye of a Disease that's sweet. Zel. Art smit? Fel. Not I. I'm prepossest. Zel. But a new, outeth an old guest. He looks upon her amazedly. What do yow gape at? Fel. If eternally I do not sleep, nor All Inchantment be Which I do lay my Eyes upon, This Face I've seen, with wonder, in another place. She's like the Sun in all: save that the Sun Is sole, but Zelidaura is not One. Did Nature dote so on her pieces worth, As to give sundry Copies of it forth? Or (which no less upon my wonder calls) Hath that one Picture four Originals? Zel. Now his Brain works like Wax, and his five Wits Relapse into their. Apoplectick Fits. I am resolved I will know his Name, Having already broke the Ice of shame. What so becalms thee? Grievous is the wound? Fel. Not, now, that of my Body. Zel. More profound That of thy Soul is, thou inferr'st. Take heed Of Sleep, for that will make it inward bleed; And the Man's giv'n to Sleeping. Fel. I shall dye, If but of wonder. Zel. Where doth thy pain lye? Fel. Just at my Heart: Inchantments are the Cause, And absence of a Queen that gives it Laws. Zel. Peace: I would be contented to know less. Fel. 'Tis she, or else her Shadow.—Shepherdess Come hither, have I seen thee before now? Zel. Can I tell what thy Eyes have seen? Fel. Hast thou Been ever in Arabia happily? Aside. Zel. (Once, but no Happy Araby to Me.) To Him. How curious to know all! I ne're was out Of these sweet fields— Fel. And therefore past all doubt, They are so sweet—And how art thou call'd. Zel. Laura: Coridon's Daughter. Fel. Know'st thou Zelidaura? (I fear a new Intrigue) Seen thee hath she? Zel. Tell me thy Name, and here I promise thee A Secret which may fully recompence A Courtesie of greater consequence: For to this Graunge comes Zelidaura oft. And these dumb flow'rs, these murmuring springs, this soft. Consort of Nightingales, this Garden Wall, Those circumjacent fields, Laura and all, Are witness to a pain she doth deplore— But till thou have oblig'd me first, no more. Fel. (O jealousie! and was not Love enough? Jealous so soon? Am I such catching stuff?) Zel. If it import thee to know more of this, Say what thou art, and why thy coming is. Aside. Fel. Forgive me Modesty, it doth behove I lay thee by, to seek (not Praise, but) Love. To Her. Friend have your Wish. Zel. Begin not with (Attend.) Fel. Nor with (O yes.) Zel. You have a merry Frend. Fel. A King hath PERSIA (Felisbravo hight) High Envy of the Gods, Mankinds delight, His birth-day a few Mays have mark'd with Flowers: The same (join'd with the drops of April show'res) Summe up his virtues. As in Logarism Nine figures makes of numbers an Abysm: So a few Springs (as he hath order'd it) Have multiply'd his Years to Infinit: Who, though not full eight thousand mornings strong, He that now wrote his Life would find it long: His Body and his Soul are so well met, That the best Gem, hath the best Cabinet. A Veil of Love his Majesty doth shroud; Which yet is so seen through, that the most proud Tread upon fears, and hear their faults aloud. He walks through the wide Fields of History: North-Star of Kings, to steer a true Course by; And, for their Faults, a Glasse that will not lye. His Hand is of two Natures: It doth hold Steel, that is clapt into it, lets go Gold, Yet strong submission wrests there out the Sword; And, frank of Deeds, he's niggard of his Word: Lest bashful Bounty make him say the thing Which will not hold: For that's unlike a King. Lets no base whispers misinform his Youth, Nor thinks it thrift on Trust to take up Truth. Vice he hath none, nor any Age hath seen Amongst so many Flow'rs so little green. He looks on Beauty (pleas'd) and passes on: A Free Prince still, ev'n where she plants her Throne. The light thereof he takes, the Fire he doth Reject: A temperate and a glorious Youth! Till some just War shall wake his sleeping Sword, And splendid Theams to Tongues and Pens afford; He follows peaceful War, breaks truce with Beasts. Sloth Foe to All, but most to Royal Breasts. The second Sol without his radiant Hair, He sacks the Woods, dispeoples the wide Ayr: The first Adone, without his Venus, Groves He doth adorn, and peoples those with Loves. This Prince felt never, never he Love's smart, Nor his most Golden Shaft durst wound his Heart; Until a Captive did in Persia thunder Such Praises of a Princesse (the Worlds Wonder) As stunn'd his senses, set his Heart at Bay, 'Twixt trembling boldness, and 'twixt bold dismay. Of Wounds less mortal dy'd the Royal Slave, Who Zelidaura's Picture to him gave, Mute Circle of two Suns. Th'inamour'd King (Whil'st he, impatient, settles ev'ry thing In order to come after, that his Realm Lament not his short abscence from the Helm) Commands my Journey to Tartaria poast, T'inform my self whether the Picture boast Real Perfections of her Queen. I fly, And reach in a few days to Araby, Where (Mortal Frailty yielding to Sleeps pow'r) A villain steals it. An Inchanted Tow'r Is interpos'd 'twixt our drawn Swords (at once That thund'ring with its fall, and I with groans) Thence to this Forrest we adjourn the War, His Treason's Altar, my Revenge's Bar. We meet; when ours so many Swords repel, As if each Blade of Grass were one of Steel. To lose my Picture, and not lose my Life, I pierc'd with Woe; And that to Poison, that to Sword, nor Knife, My Death I owe. To Persia dare not (for the King) return (For coldest Hearts, when fir'd once, fiercest burn) Who, sweetly snar'd with Zelidaura's Fame, No Love else answers, hears no other Name. Rare Shepherdesse (whether thou be the Flow'r Of forreign Plains, or of these Hills the Tow'r) If help thou have, or help to thee be known, If more thou art, or canst, than thou dost own, Pity my Woes, set my Confusions right, Ease so great pain, shew day to so great night. Aside. Zel. Most undoubtedly 'tis He, Because (for more disguise) I see His proper Praise he did not spare. To Him. I shall soon find it.—Thy great Care And Courage (Persian) I admire. Couldst thou the Picture know again? Fel. If it take up my Thoughts entire, And Copied in my Heart remain, Must I not know it? Zel. Look on this: And mark it well. Fel. Had I no Aim By any feature, whose it is The matchless Beauty would proclaim. Aside. What Bon-fires (Heart) wilt thou now make for Joy? I would not have them less Than my Love's Flame, or those of Troy; And monstrous, as to me, is Happiness. A Lover is not glad, Unless withall he's Mad: Nor can my Gratitude expressed be With any thing that's less than Lunacie. I do not celebrate my Good With so much splendour as I ought, Nor its full worth have understood, If this effect it have not wrought. Zel. He's like a Man that talks t'a Spirit— To the Picture. Fel. Beautiful and injur'd Shade, More blame (I must confess) I merit, Than past his Hour a Lover who hath staid. To Her. Shepherdess, who gave it thee? For, amidst varietie, Seeing the self-same Beauty ever, I credit, what I tremble to assever. Zel. Then, Persian, of a Countrey Lass Perceive an Act a Queen might do; Through this blind Labyrinth to pass My Pity giving thee a Clew. I am the Woman thou didst see, In several shapes, in Arabie; And who from thee this Picture stole; And whom, if that rare King (the Soul And Martial Glory of the Chase) Merit the Praise thou giv'st His Grace, Wish thee return to Persia faster Than thou cam'st hither, and thy Master (The Gen'rous Felisbravo) tell; He shall to Tartary do well To come with wings, where (if he prove As humble, and as much in love, As great in Courage, and high-flown) Queen Zelidaura is his own: The most exempted Heart reserving For the Person most deserving: And say, thou heard'st it from one Laura, Who heard it in this place from Zelidaura. Aside. Fel. Shall I think my Senses true? Zelidaura 'tis I view. No, no, it is not; 'Tis my Eye Flatters my Wishes with so sweet a Lye. To Her. Angel I go; and shall the King Quickly to Tartaria bring. Zel. It is not Felisbravo, no; For he his Mask now off would throw. What have I done? My being kind I will retract, unless I find This Face, this Courage, and this Meen, In a Kings Person, to deserve a Queen. Compares her with the Picture, interchangeably regarding either. Fel. That, of the Hand which made us all, Picture, is thy Originall, None, that before appeared such, Did Face to Face avow so much. An Egg is not more like an Egg, Nor the Left to the Right Leg. Nature, that drain'd her Stores to do One Face like this, despair'd of Two. They descant to themselves upon each other. Zel. Is this a Servant? Fel. Is this Laura? I ne're was in a Maze till now. Zel. Then art not Felisbravo, thou? Fel. Art thou then, Zelidaura? Aside. Zel. (His fear compels him to conceal, My love shall prompt him to reveal, Himself—) Sir Knight— Fel. Fair Shepherdess, Thy divine commands express. Zel. The Picture's mine, I am not Laura: If thou art Felisbravo, follow To the Temple of Apollo: I am relenting Zelidaura. Exit. Fel. Suspend thy steps: With all my Heart (Beauteous Queen) I follow thee: (But that's already where thou art—) As going after her, when Enter hastily, Claridiana in Mans Apparel and stays him. Cla. Valiant King, come back to me. Fel. Off, Remora— Cla. Whom hurlst thou fro thee? Fel. Youth, for this ill turn beshrow thee. Cla. Hear me, thou new Alcides. Fel. What Wouldst thou with me? Cla. Know'st me not? Fel. No, nor would. Cla. So soon (unkind!) Claridiana out of mind? Fel. Me, that the Sea burneth, tell. Cla. Look upon me, Stranger, well. Fel. The Cloaths and smartness, thou put'st an, Speak the bold language of a Man; But that Complexion, and that Grace, Woman write upon thy Face: And one, whom I have elsewhere seen. Cla. Ah! Wonder not, the most distrest Of Women, seeks of Men the best: Of Arabia I am Queen, On which the Gold, that therein is, The Name of Happy did bestow, And, of Perfumed, from her Trees The Aromatick Tears that flow. My Father (through whose Magick Lore The shook Earth groan'd, and on whose back, As on strong Atlas'is of yore, The Heaven was a Golden Pack) Erected there th'inchanted Tow'r, For curious and magnificent, Proportioned to Regal Pow'r, And Art's Divine Astonishment. Th'intention was to thee made known, Then, when thou couldst not keep by Wit That, which by Valour thou didst git; So many Monsters overthrown. The Duel was abruptly done, Abruptly was the War begun, Feign'd to be here in Tartary By Claridoro's Jealousy. Certain Eyes were thy North-Stars, Which directed thy Course hither: If Ruth, or Love, or love of Wars, The Cause, thou know'st; I know not whether. I staid alone: My Subjects (broke Loose from their Duty) They, require T'an Idol I should offer smoke, For whom my Altar had no Fire. Up-sighing, to the Gods, Complaints; Heav'ns sacred pity I implore; The Sun, surpriz'd with darkness, faints; The Thunder in the Ayre doth roar. My Magick Father (reconcil'd By her misfortunes to his Child) Informs me how this Cabin mean Inshrines the Persian King serene. Thou art the Man, thou Felisbravo art, In Praise of whom Fame sings her well conn'd Part Two Worlds already with thy Name doth fill, And makes both Poles hear plain her Trumpet shrill. Thy Aid I crave, to thee my wrongs discover, As thou art brave, not as thou art a Lover: (For, tell not me of constant Lovers; such I have heard much of, but believe not much.) Restore Claridiana to her Crown: Thy Name will make the Loyal (who are down) O'retop the rest. These, are the spoyls thou ow'st To Fame's bright Temple; These, are deeds to boast Thee, for their Author: Leave, fam'd Prince, soft thoughts, Leave Cupid's vain Caresses, and tame faults Of Idleness; thy Damask Blade unsheath; In Rest couch Ash; on which when North Winds breath It bends (a Twig) but now (more stubborn Wood) Shew's Beak of Steel, made drunk with Crimson Flood. Arm'd, let the Field behold thee; and make blush The shoulders of thy digg'd Bucephalus With Foamed Spurs: In thee Apollo bright Be dy'd with Blood, Red Mars be guilt with sight. My Truncheon weild with that victorious Hand. Two Phœnixes shall then the Arabs Land (As to immortal, as to glorious) have; But (as to valiant) only FELISBRAVE. Aside. Fel. Love, and Honour, pull two ways; And I stand doubtful which to take: To Arabia, Honour says, Love says, no; thy stay here make, Honour (like to lose the day) Pity throws into her scale Love, Gratitude in his doth lay; Fearing else not to prevail. Fair Zelidaura shall I flee, Just now, when in her Grace I stand; One of those happy fools to be, Who prize no Bird that's in the hand? Aside. So (your less Fool) a Child too, cryes For a rich Gem, which got, the Boy Runs after something else he spies, And leaves his Jewel for a toy. Deaf then to loud Musick of Mars, To his spread Flags let me be blind. I'm summon'd here to higher Wars. And those are cruel, these are kind. To wrong'd Claridiana, than Discourteous Coward shall I prove? Knowing my Heart (as I do) can, Dare I, to it, such baseness move? Not, by Courtship, not on Doun, Is acquir'd sublime Renoun: But Prowess indefatigable Scales Alpes and ploughs up Seas unstable. Cla. How long he doth debate it in his Brest? “Slow comes Relief, where little Love doth rest. Aside still. Fel. Pardon me, Zelidaure, this way I take And (which is more) I leave thee for thy sake: For, of thy Lover none deserves the Name, Who will not succour a Distressed Dame. Stand me, Arabia: If I gain the day The Spoils at Zelidaura's Feet I'll lay. Enter General. Gen. Leave Felisbravo, leave the vain Alarms Of a false Honour, and Love's vainer Charms. These pull proud Pontus on thy trembling Relm. Ev'n Courage fears, the Pilot from the Helm: Hast home: 'Tis brav'ry past my skill t' admire, To quench another's house, thine own on Fire. Once let not appetite prevail, not still The worst be chose, and Reason stoop to Will. Waste not thy years in Love, or cruel Ruth, And weed betimes ev'n Flow'rs that choak thy Youth. Return to Persia, leave Romancing, leave Disnerving Loves, and all that may deceive The Harvest of so fair a Spring. “The Birth “Of Kings is to be Patterns to the Earth, “Not blotting-papers, but to write fair by; “Nor pleasures Slaves, or tryumphs of an Eye. Cla. This seems a trick. Heav'ns! That a Man should dare To forfeit his good Manners to my Pray'r! Fel. Gen'ral, well urg'd: But first I'll pay two scores: One here, another where my Soul adores— To Her. Claridiana comfort thy soft Brest, Heroick Minds are try'd when they are prest. List me thy Captain, or thy Souldier: Come Live thou, though I dye here, and lose at home. Gen. Bright Persian Prince, The World will hang the Temple of thy worth With all the Vows Oppression shall rack forth. T'Arabia then; thy look will conquer there, And thy Fame strike the Pontick King with Fear. Aside. Fel. Good Courtier, but ill Lover, now am I: I know it, but I know no Remedy. Aside. Cla. I carry thee, to War against my Land: Against my Heart to War too, underhand. Exeunt. Enter Zelidaura. 'Tis not, the Persian Felisbrave; He would have follow'd: And if Fame With a true Mouth his Worth proclaim, He (if he lov'd) my Love might have. For he that will my Hand deserve, Must, in a constant Soul, comprize The understanding of the Wise. The diligence of those that serve, Perfections of a King discover, And the tremblings of a Lover. Enter Claridoro habited like a Countrey Gentleman. Claro. For the Queen now To Court to call me is no pleasure To one who wisely minds the Plow, And rowls in Leisure. Sweet Solitude! still Mirth, that fear'st no wrong, Because thou doest none! Morning all day long! Truth's Sanctuary! Innocency's Spring! Invention's Limbeck! Contemplation's Wing! Peace of my Soul, which I too late pursude! That know'st not the Worlds vain Inquietude: Where Friends (the Thieves of Time) let us alone Whole days; and a Mans Hours are all his own. Happy art thou, that, unsupplanted, plantest; Nor seest in Court (which to thy Harm thou hantest) Th'undoing Truth of rigid Honesty; The profitable Lye of Flattery; The sweet Disease of Hope the Potion, And bitter Health of Undeception. Turns to her. Madam, your pleasure (for, in haste, A Servant call'd me, to wait on Your Highness.) Zel. Diligence goes fast: As for haste else, there was none. The wounded Stranger, is he gone? Claro. Just now. Zel. (I ask'd that which I grieve to know) Aside. Went he Cur'd fully? Claro. Truly, No: He stumbled o're his Health, because a Woman, In a Mans Habilliment (Invited by his Fame) did summon Him, to some Action; and with Her he went. Zel. With a Woman? Caro. Yes, and one Whose spriteliness, whose Beauty's Rays, Whose every way perfection, I never to the worth can praise: And the valiant Felisbrave (For so she call'd him) went with her, So contented, brisk, and brave— Zel. Peace: It is too much to hear. Treason against Love, nay High- Treason? Together did they go? Clar. Together. Zel. How you lye, you lye— But (ah!) 'tis true, because it grieves me so. Bid them that Fellow hither bring I caus'd be seiz'd on. Claro. What means this? But Duty says, know not the thing, Which hidden by thy Sov'raign is. Exit. Zel. A Man denies to me his Name; Leaves me, and for another Dame, And have I yet so much good nature As to complain of such a Creature? Go, thou cruel Man to me; Hope not, I'll my self deplore Upon thy score: For, to form Complaints of Thee, Were to make my favours more. If, the meer thinking thou wert lov'd, To remove Thee could move, Well thou might'st have not remov'd, For thou wert not yet belov'd. If my Will inclin'd a little, Well that deserv'd thy hope to swell, Confidence, well; Well, thy Vanity to tickle; But it not deserv'd thee fickle. Thy thus forgetting, doth confess Thou held'st the victory, secure, Thy Tryumph sure; For (whil'st you live) a Happiness Is Mother of Forgetfulness. O, froward Stars! What I, betray'd? How can I suffer such a strange And sudden change? That I, whom Love fear'd to invade, Object should of Scorn be made! Ignoble Knight! Lover unkind! Inconstant as the Wind! If she thy Love requite, In mid'st of Joyes be sterv'd, And let unhappiness be once deserv'd. Art thou a Prince? Fame lies: “Plain dealing is for Majesties. “A Prince will falshood flye, “If but because it argues fear, to Lye. Seem only wise, in that Thou be unfortunate; Earn neither Brass, nor Pen, To make thee live with Men; And let thy Name (if it in Fanes they kerve) For scorn, for pity, nor for pattern, serve. In thee just jealousie move A thousand ways, Another Less lovely, less a Lover. So short let thy sweets prove That thy felicity May be an inch to measure Beauty by. This (who, thy Wife to be, Seeks, by supplanting Me) Maist thou love her, like those that foul ones chuse: May she love thee, as courted fair ones use: And, if she prove a Bane, In being immortal, let it seem my pain. If ye shall disagree, Live to Eternitie; If ye love, live a year; An hour, if fondly dear; But, do not live a jot; And let a Faulchion cut your Nuptial Knot. Enter Rifaloro trembling. Rif. O that in fooling tune I were! But, I am not in tune to fool. By Hercules, I have a fear, Withall my strength, I cannot rule. And, if Rewards for fear were set, I those from all the World should get. They say, 'tis Zelidaura's Grace, Whom I call'd Mad-cap to her face: So now, must I expect the pay Of those, who Truths to Great-Ones say. Give me, Madam—(I recoil) Offers to approach her, and dares not. Thy Feet—No— Zel. The Servant vile, He, for that Lye, shall feel my Thunder— But—If a King could lye, what wonder? Rif. A Devil, Angeliz'd, is shee. I tremble like an Aspine Tree: Each joint's a leaf. Zel. What makes this Rascal stay? Sees him. Oh! Is he there? Rif. Give—Give me (I say.) Zel. I'll give thee Death, Impostor. Traitor— Lifts up her hand, as if to strike him. Rif. Hold Thunderbolt of Lillies— Zel. Traitor, How is thy Master call'd? Rif. Things seem, And are not: Man's Life is a dream— Zel. His Name— Rif. A Servant is all Ear, and sight— Zel. I'll have his Name— Rif. And reason good: Persiano. (I'm not understood.) Zel. Villain, His Name— Rif. I say the same Don Persiano is his Name. Zel. Thou triflest with thy Life: Confess— Offers at him with a Dagger. Or— Rif. Hold then— Zel. His true Name express— Rif. Per—si—a—no—Angel, stay: Playing with Hands, is the Clowns play. In Cypher is his true Name writ: And I have lost the Key of it. Falls on his knees. Weary not thy self, Queen mine: Racks shall not force it from this Brest: For, though to Jesting I incline; I ne're though Knavery a good Jest. Zel. A Rogue on Honours points to stand! In thee it is a sauciness: ('Tis well I knew it before hand:) And yet, withal, I must confess, This Servant, with the Soul he hath, Might teach his Master to keep Faith. What a foul shame 'tis! Rif. By the Gods, Those Sages, who do boast such odds Of all the World, shall find—We Fools Are most considerable Tools. Zel. The ill-deserved Name to Me Of Felisbrave is known already: Who, of Arabia, is gone to be The petty King, and the Gallant unsteddy. He Travail'd with Claridiane. Follow him thou (this Royal Hand With servile Blood I scorn to stain) And let thy Master understand; Though he pretend t'invincible, that I Will make him, for my trampled footstool, lye; A Woman, in Revenge; a Soveraign, In Courage; and a Mistresse, in Disdain. Rif. With Claridiane (by Jove) Did he go? Zel. I think thou 'rt glad. Rif. Have I not cause, if he can love A pair of Queens, and make them both run Mad? The Spanish fashion hath my Vote, In Mistresses, though not in Diet: One goes but dully down the Throte, Six in a Dish the modern Riot. Zel. If thy Doctrine, Knave, Men follow; They had need of a great swallow. Rif. Two at a clap! why, now he's somebody, He 'as laid already the trunk-breeches by. One, was the stint of old; our Fare now mends: To thy Twin-Sister hast thou no Commends? Zel. Away, like Light'ning; tell them their Fate comes: Scorn clears the Ways, and Ancer beats my Drums. Rif. This Queen knows how her Poast to chuse, That sends a Fool with an ill News. Exeunt. Trumpets and Drums Sound a March, and Enter Felisbravo, General and Claridiana, Armed, and People as an Army Marching. Cla. This is Arabia. Fel. Yon Adamant Wall, With its proud Tow'rs, at thy kiss'd feet shall fall: For so resolv'd (though slender) are thy Bands, To Ammunition they will turn these Sands. Gen. A flying Squadron meets us on the Border, In a loose way, without all Martial Order: It looks like Peace. Fel. To overcome, procure: “In Traitors looks no signs of Peace are sure. Trumpets and Drums, and Enter Floranteo with People. Flo. Thy warlike Preparations (Queen) suspend: Gay Purple button, clasp not glitt'ring Steel; Since now, the People neither Wall defend, Nor with Usurping Grasp, the Scepter feel. Enter thy lofty Palace, Roof'd with Gold; Thy little-spoil'd though much profan'd Abodes; Chuse, where thou lik'st; and in calm Peace grow old: “'Tis ill Rebelling against Kings, or Gods. Not, to disturb it Floranteo came; But, thy disturbed Kingdom, to recover: To kiss thy hand, as of his Soveraign Dame; Not, challenge it, as thy presumptuous Lover. Cla. Rise, and be second to thy thankful Queen. Flo. Wear this Gold Crown first, wreath'd with Laurel-green, And Olive, which thy Birth, and Virtue, give: Live long our Queen! All. Claridiana, live! Enter Rifaloro with a Poast-whip in his hand. Rif. Rare Post-horses! in less than half an hour To bring me hither from Tartaria? My own Barbs (lay'd) would have conveigh'd me slower: Nor could I have come sooner in a Play. The Woman is a Harpie: O! that I Were one of your Wind-mongers, that Cry News; To relate mine, with strange Romancery: But, I have no Alliance with those Jews. Here are Soldiers—That, is hee! Sir, your Foot; and take my Knee. Fel. These Armes, my Rifaloro—Where hast been? What hast thou done, since thou by me wert seen? Rif. The Story's long: Some other tell it Thee, Who hath no Wit to spoil his Memorie. Rowse, Sir, with thicker Steel your Breast immure: Nor Felisbravo, nor Arabia now, Nor the spectator World, can be secure From Zelidaura; who, because that thou Deny'st to her thy Name, and she's alarm'd With your joint-journey, comes with Terrours Arm'd. Fel. Thou Slave (it seems) made of the coursest Clay, A Secret so important didst betray. But, I'm right serv'd— Rif. This 'tis now, to know any Secret, of one, who tells it unto many. Fel. This 'tis, when Kings consort themselves with Grooms. Rif. Help (Masters) or, if not, Might, Right o'recomes. Gen. What is the matter? Rif. Nothing, but the King Pays Honesty her Wages: A fine thing It is, to look on; a rare decking (sure) For a Rich Man; but, 'twill undo a poor; And be suspected too. So counterfet Seems the best Jewell when 'tis meanly set. All, I have gain'd, by being true, was (There) A Jayl, a Dagger at my Bosome; (Here) This, which you see. 'Tis time to rest (say I) And cast safe Anchor upon Knavery. Fel. In what a leaking Butt Have I my Secret put! No (angry Fair One) No: Not, of thy Blade, My Life; but, of thy Doubt, my Love's afraid. Rif. Thus, do good Actions shine? Is this, the Meed To faithful silence is decreed? This of being an honest Man, Is a lean Office; with Fees none: It will not keep a Gentleman, Without some other good Means of his own. The Foe, in Reason, cannot far off be; For Zelidaura Marches furiouslie. Cla. Come all Tartaria with her; here she stands, Will welcome Her, more Valiant, and less vain: That barb'rous Warriouress shall, of these Hands, The Trophy be, the scorn, and the disdain. Our Self is General. Gen. Great Atlas quakes, A trepidation of the Spheres it makes, To hear that sound from thee; who, in these Wars, Wilt Muster Flow'rs, and Lead an Host of Stars. Fel. I'll view their Camp, and compt the Enemy. Cla. Such a Spy is quickly spy'd: I fear thy danger. Fel. 'Twas Wisdom put out Polyphemo's Eye; That Mountain of swoln Pride. Come (Rifaloro) by thy Masters side. Rif. I fear thy Anger: Thou tell'st it in this Audience; would'st go hid: Points to the Spectators. They, tell it Zelidaura: Then I'm chid. Gen. What Audience? The Man dreams—I go with thee. Rif. Yes, Let my Fellow go; and I will be Thy Leidger here. Flo. Sir, let me beg the Honour— Fel. By no means (Floranteo:) Wait upon her Fair Majesty. Fear it to me unknown: And mine's a Business best perform'd alone. Aside. Cla. (I think no less, and hide my fear in vain Under the silence of my Virgin shame.) Fel. 'Tis Fear, makes Mortals peep through their disguise: Unseen, we'll thrid Our Person through their Eyes. Come, Rifalore. Rif. Not I, one of course Earth Consort with Kings? A Slave of Dunghil Birth? I renounce Honesty, I pray your Grace Chuse a new Fool, and tye that to the Place. Cla. Less of the Lover than the Brave it shows, Thy self to such wild dangers to expose. Let common Soldiers hazzard in this kind: “Valour, within due bounds, should be confin'd. Fel. If known, I would not fear an Hoast of Men; Though Arm'd with Fire and Horrour: March on, then. Dangers I court, and all that Dangers brings: “For Bullets bear a Reverence to Kings. Trumpets. A March. Exeunt. Sound Trumpets and Drums, and Enter Zelidaura, Claridoro, Roselinda, and Soldiers. Zel. Now, Claridoro, on Arabian Mould We tread, and have the Enemy in view. Claro. Since so much Beauty fights thy Cause, be bould To write; I Came, was Seen, and did Subdue. Zel. Not Love, but Honour, made me March thus far. A Queen's it is, and not a Woman's War. If I o'recome, I'll scorn them, as I live: “Two Victories; to Conquer, and Forgive; “On ground that's hard, 'tis easie ground to win: “But feet, which tread upon the soft, sink in. Claro. The Cause I never Zelidaura scann'd, It must be good which thou dost take in hand: And, doubt the Conquest, where thou present art, No more, than whether I should take thy part, Whose Services are Debts to thee; and when Thou lett'st me pay thee one, that one grows ten. Thy heav'nly force is unto me so known, That, though great MARS in SOL's bright Armour shone, I'th'adverse Camp; I should not fear the day: For Beauty stole one's Sword, the other's Ray. But, for thy pardon—That, may spared be: What greater Death, than to be scorn'd by thee? Enter a Captain bringing Felisbravo in the Habit of a Countrey Boor or Clown. Capt. Madam, This Clown, who seems a Spy, I bring before thy Majesty: That thou, from him, maist draw, and know, The Strength, and Posture, of the Foe. Zel. Whom see I? Is't not FELISBRAVE? 'Tis Anger, and not Love, did grave His Visage here, and my Revenge's Eyes Have pick'd him out of his obscure Disguise. Ros. A Spy thou well might'st think him; feel, He hath his Cassock lin'd with Steel. A Gentleman, at least, by this. Zel. No, no, a Clown I'm sure he is. Speak for thy self, art thou not one? Fel. A Clown in my Attire alone. Zel. In one thing more ('twixt me and you) Thou sleep'st to One, and wak'st to Two. Fel. Me, does your Worship know? Zel. At last; For there is a distance vast Betwixt a Clown's Tongue, and his Mind: And his Faith is hard to find. Fel. Dissembling words, and little faith, Boast, they Courtly Vices are: “Nothing more Clownish is, than wrath; “And Revenge, that none will spare. Wade not in doubts too far, th'effect Of which, is bitterness, and rue: “For (let me tell you) to suspect, “Is, a kind of sleeping too. Do not wake Jealous: For, indeed, 'Tis courteous baseness, and no other. Nor borrow, of thy Clownish Weed, The Malice, that, is us'd to cover. He never fled, who wheels about: And He, who (born for higher Ends) Did best, when he lay under doubt; Gallantly his Faith defends. And He, whose worth in ev'ry thing (In this I will appeal to LAURA) Proclaims him not a perfect King, Deserves not to love ZELIDAURA. Zel. Clown, or Spy, or what thou wilt, Think not t'appease me thou art able: For justifying a known Guilt, With Women is impardonable. Aloud. Tell me Lab'ring-Man) how strong Is CLARIDIANA? Fel. Hear— Aside. (Heavens! how it thunders Vengeance from her Tongue? Yet still 'tis Musick to my Ear.) Aloud. Arabia being reduc'd to her obedience, She hath two Armys of old Soldiers, Beat to the Trade of War; valiant, and disciplin'd; In suff'ring, noble: and in acting, bold: The Goddesse-Queen (whose Beauty doth eclipse The brightest lustre of the mid-day Sun) Comes for the General; and in her alone is Narcissus joyn'd with Sol; Mars with Adonis. From a Sphere, crown'd with plumes (like Summers Clouds When the Day feels a Light'ning before Death, Or Gardens in the Air) Arm'd with a heav'nly Anger, she discovers In Thetis Body great Achilles's Soul. Her Sword cuts more than all those of her Army; Her Beauty more victorious, then her Sword: For where's the life so sure that Love can pick No hole in it, which would not soon surrender It self into her hands, without more strife, To sue out a new grant to be a life? With gallant grace she traverses the Field Upon a Horse, that pays the vanity, Infus'd into the Bruit by his fair Burthen, With mettle, and with motion that keeps time: His swiftness calls him Dart, his striking fire A Thunder-bolt, his colour and his gate Majestick Swan. Like a Ship under sail, Tossing the foam up, proudly he doth go, With Plumes for Streamers, Argosie of Snow. Zel. With great Latona's Off-spring do not brag, Least thou be turn'd t' a weeping stone. Say, 'tis a fine fore-handed Nag, That hath his paces every one: And lacks (to do a thousand pranks) Only, to have been foal'd on Betis Banks. Here's trapping out a Horse withal my heart, Why, 'twould make one his Bridle break: Snow, Ship, Swan, Streamers, Thunderbolt, and Dart? Troth, go but one step more, and make him speak. A Description call'st thou this? In blank Verse (of all four lame) With equal Tropes, and Emphasis, To Cry a Beast up, and a Dame? Fel. Her Beauty then she brings along: And that's ten thousand Graces strong. Zel. Flat jealousie in my Face hurl'd? (The greatest Clown'ry this i'th'World!) If, that, I brought, I by did throw; Shall I catch this he throws me? No, Let Claridiana come; With her, her Beauty, and her Felisbrave; In ev'ry thing I'll her o'recome: Ev'n in this too, that less of vain I'll have. Back, Felisbravo; put into each Troop As much of Courage, as I hope to quail: To whom thy Fear, and not thy Love, shall stoop; And I, by Force, not Beauty, will prevail. Thou art my Pris'ner (foolish Man) Conquer'd by putting this shape an. But 'tis not thou shalt pay me: 'Tis my boast, To pay my self, that which to me thou ow'st. Fight well to day: Since thou dost love Claridiane; Let not Twain Thee reprove; One Woman call thee Coward, t'other Twit thee with perfidious Lover. But, this I'll say; had I lov'd thee, Thou would'st not thus have used mee: Nor durst have acted such a valiant Sin, As unto Me Ungrateful to have bin. Fel. Madam, how high an obligation This lays on me, and on my passion! A Servant now, that takes no Wages of thee: But Loves Thee (why?) only to love thee. In the hearing of the rest. —Hear me, ZELIDAURA— Zel. Turn This Fellow back to his own Camp: And (with my glitt'ring Bands) though these Woods burn, Though, on these plains, my numbers strike a damp. Tell Felisbravo; Claridore, and I, Without or Mars, or Sol, their Pow'rs defie. Aside. Fel. Ev'n her Anger, O! how sweet! I hope my self yet, at her Feet To prostrate Victory—But no, To Her. Her Eyes will snatch it first—I go. Set thy People in Array. Zel. This, Claridoro, is thy day. Claro. Where thou art, all things must go well. Zel. Sound an Alarum. Fel. Tole my Knell. Trumpet a little. Exeunt. Enter General with his Sword drawn. Gen. Bloody perdition tyrannizing make, Grim War, that Strewd'st with Carcases the way To th'first Injustice, which free Mortals broke, And Iron Scepter plac'd in hand of Clay: Barbarous Trade, so murmur'd at in vain, To spur the fiery Coursers of pale Death, As if Time flagg'd, as if to be humane Were not Disease enough to stop our Breath. But, though thou (War) art dire, art full of dread; There is a Feud more dire, more dreadful far, When Beauty's bloody Flag (hang'd out and spread In Virgins Cheeks) proclaims a scornful War. Love, let me rather be a rough-hand's Prize, Than the soft Captive of insulting Eyes. Enter Rifaloro with his Sword drawn. Rif. They March to shock these Girls, some small Wit now Would Lids of Marchpane call, Cæsars of Snow. Gen. Why, Rifaloro, Went'st not with Him, Thou? 'Tis not well done to fail thy Duty so. To jest out faults is an uncomely thing. Rif. Can I (that from the Trojan Brutus spring) That vaunt great Blood, I have much Blood I spill, Be wanting to the Huff, to the Punctil Of Honour? Being of the Mountains too, In which the Heculesses always grew? Gen. Art thou a Britton then? Rif. So brags each one That would write Gentleman, when he is none. This day shall set the King high on my score; For, such an honest Man is Rifalore, So faithful to his Master, that a Trim Map of Misfortune might be made of him. And (see the fate which still attends upon it!) The scurvy Poet, giving each a Sonnet, Leaves only me without—But, by the faith Of a Mahumetan, since thus he hath Provok'd me to't, upon his skirts I'll sit: Damme all his Matter, 'cause in Verse 'tis writ: And, in defiance of the Triple Three, Promote a Law, importing, that, to bee, Or not to be, a Poet; shall suffice To prove, past doubt, one is not, or is, wise. Gen. Stand, Rifaloro, to thy Arms: The Drums Do beat a Charge, and Felisbravo comes. Rif. St. whom invoke they? Gen. MARS, the God of Wars. Rif. St. GEORGE for Us, the Garter'd English Mars. Exeunt. Enter Marching at one Door Claridiana, as with an Army, Drums and Files, and her self in the Reare with a Truncheon, and Felisbravo by her side; At the other Door Zelidaura in like manner, with Claridoro before her all Armed, Cla. Valiant Arabians, let these barb'rous Troops (Men built to serve) their bending Foreheads yield: As, with a fierce South Wind, an Army stoops Of drowsie Poppies in a barren field. Zel. Food for your Steel brave Sons of Tartarie) Let these soft Peasants of Arabia be: For, ill can brook the glitt'ring of a Sword, A Countrey only famous for a Bird. Cla. In our contention now, not Mars, But Cupid is the God of Wars. And (turn'd to tears) thy proud disdain Puts Love in Arms, makes Heav'n complain. If thy coming be to wring From me the famous Persian King; Though I do love him, I esteem From thee t'have got him, more than him. For, 'mongst my Glories, I less prize My Conquest, than thy Hue and Cryes. Zel. To pull this fickle Prince from thee, Is Honour, and not Love, in me: For, with so false a Lover, know, I'll part at all times to a Foe. To give to him, no hand I bring; But feet, on both your necks to print: For, in my greatest Conquering, And utmost of tyrumphing in't, Having first punish'd his Inconstancie, For more Revenge, I'll after give him Thee. Offers to Charge and Felisbravo throws himself at her Feet. Fel. Zelidaura, hold thy Hand: Conquer not twice a Man unmann'd. She needs not Weapons, that is fair: He needs not Death, who hath despair. Already, of thy generous Feet I kiss the yoak. In the most sweet And glorious Cause of Love, let my life owe To me, the divine choice to lose it so. Zel. Rise; hence; begone; I will not have thee dye At thy Election, nor in Courtesie, But, by my Fauchion: Not, like Felisbrave, Not, my devoted, but my conquer'd Slave. Cla. Stay, Traitor, where thou art: Reveng'd I'll be Both on the proud, and on the humble: Thee I'll conquer, and forget; and both your Hearts (Transfixt with other, than with am'rous Darts) Under my vext feet trample— Rif. Well plaid, Girls: Mastiffs of Ivory! Dragons of Pearls. Fel. I'll have no Battail. Cla. The whole Earth a Lake Of Blood, and Scene of Horrour, I will make. Rif. O how Sir Poll, my Grandsire would cry ('S Bears!) Kings and Queens seen together by the Ears! Well, there's no flinching now; my strengths I summon: To see the last Man born and the last Woman. Zel. Sound, Sound a Charge. Cla. Lock with the Foe. Fel. Hold— Claro. Charge them home—But, the Heav'ns (loe!) Rash the Clouds open. Rif. Monsieur Jove Throws (thund'ring) 'twixt them his steel Glove. Sounds Drums and Trumpets, and let Mars pass over the Stage in a Chariot drawn with Lyons, having in his hand a fiery Lance. Mars. CLARIDIANA (second Phœnix of Arabia) and thou Tartarian Queen (In whom alone pride is not folly) I Who (General of Heav'n, and Earths Protector) Suppress'd the proud Rebellion of the Gyants In Phlegra's Plains: I, who in burning Troy (Supplying the bold Greeks with fire and sword) Saw frighted Xanthus scud 'twixt banks of Cyndars: I, who (through Romes revenging fury) saw Of the great Carthage scarce one stone remaining For a dumb witness that she once had been: I, who upon Iberian Walls beheld Turbants for Battlements, and Barb'ry Mares Turn'd loose into the Andalusian Corn: Now (a Peace-maker) bring, not signs of Wars, But Leagues confirm'd with Characters of Stars. The Gods (who call you by a hid impulse To people the grave Temple, and wast Grove Of the most chast best Goddess) know, the World Has not a Prince deserves so high perfections: For Heav'n is stuck all o're with injur'd Beauties. Thou, gallant CLARIDORO, Rule (as King) Great Tartary; and FLORANTEO, thou Reign in the famous and the fair Arabia. For the most Valiant Knight, and perfect Lover (Though ZELIDAURA know not this, or will not) Let the Great KING of Persia be Crown'd. Queens lay down Arms; for (to make War on Beasts) From painted Quivers, at your shoulders hung, Of Shafts a flying Squadron will suffice. Diana's Nuns are coming to receive you, Their Heads with Olive, Flowers, and Laurel bound. This, in the rolling chambers of the Spheres, The glorious Heptarchie of Heav'n ordains By a Law always just, always inviolable. Drums and Trumpets. Fel. Hold, MARS divine; for thou (both Judge and Party) Envy'st my Flame, whose object doth as far Outshine thy Mistress, as the Sun a Star! Claro. Stay, Soveraign MARS, I'd rather be, than have The whole Worlds Empire, ZELIDAURA's Slave. Flo. I, from this sentence, to those Gods appeal, Who feel more love, or more compassion feel. Zel. Princes, resist not Heav'n; for still ye may Love, without hope; and that's the noblest way. Cla. I reverence it, and adore its Laws. Rif. A foolish ending! Were't not just (Into a Cloyster if they must) Heav'n for these Virgins, did reserve Some portions, that they may not sterve When they repent them? And, must not, After their Dames the Damsels trot? Ros. The Damsels stay, for visible Example To a bad World, in which they are a Temple And Cloyster to themselves, meaning to live Not less austere, though less contemplative. Fel. I always lov'd thee only, for Love's Cause And Joy, a glimpse of Hope once blest mine Eyes Which on his Altar I may sacrifice. Claro. Thou, Zelidaura, shalt still guide the Helm: Whilst I am still the Defender of thy Relm. To Claridiana. Flo. And thou shalt be Arabia's Queen, and mine. Zel. “Virtues are Kingdoms at Diana's Shrine. If so, then their Possessions greatest call Who dispossess themselves of All. Cla. Crown Floranteo. Soldiers. Thy Feet kisses Crown Him. Arabia: Live Crown'd with Blisses. Crown Claridoro. Live, Claridoro. Claro. Cry Dye, Claridoro, dye. The Temple opens. Cornets. Gen. The Temple opes, the Air rejoices, Gay Nymphs present sweet Flow'rs and Voices. They sing within. Live, Fair Ones, for your Selves, whilst the Men do Think it enough, if They may Dye for You. The Queens enter the Temple, from whence many Nymphs come forth to receive them, and therein let Diana appear. Zel. I, born was, for my Self alone. Cla. The Altar now shall be my Throne. Claro. My Love doth no reward pretend. Flo. My torment ne're will have an end. Fel. “To Love only to Love, is Love “Like that w'are lov'd with from above: “He that hopes, no Love doth bear. Claro. Then what should he, that hopes not, fear? Rif. It remains now— Gen. What now remains? Rif. That the Magnifick Poet give Some Thirty Mannours all with large Demains Amongst the Actors upon which to live; And do in any Case declare That All our Worships Cosen Germans are. Gen. What a Conceipt of a stale date! Rif. Sir (for now Men say not, State) Here endeth the Play Of for Ever and Aye; Tiring Female and Male, Without a Marriage in the Tayle; And this it doth git By being Penn'd without Wit. Immediately upon pronouncing the last words, the Temple or Throne ascended to the Place where it was before (viz the upper Tower of the Castle) and in it Zelidaura and Claridiana seated on either side the Goddess, also some Nymphs; and at the same time (Trumpets and Drums Sounding) the two Armies went Marching off at several doors, the Comedy ending there; and the Festival in a Dance, after the manner of a Tournament by The Lady Mary Gusman, The Lady Anne Sandi, The Lady Margarite Zapata, The Lady Margarite Tavara, The Lady Mary Cutinio, The Lady Frances Tavara, All Armed in Mens Apparel, and the Dance being ended all the Instruments Sounded out at once.
