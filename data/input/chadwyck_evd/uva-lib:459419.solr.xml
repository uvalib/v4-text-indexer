      <field name="fulltext">FILLI DI SCIRO. OR Phillis of Scyros. An Excellent PASTORALL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GENTLE READER, The Pastor Fido, Translated by some Author before this: And both of them neer twenty years agone. Elder Sister of this Blushing Maid, Long kept in darkness, and severely staid From looking forth, by him who thought the dress He cloth'd her in, too homly to express That native Beauty, which by birth she drew, From her first Parent, who exactly knew How to attire her in so rich a Trim, As might win honour both to her, and him: Greeving perhaps to be so coursely us'd, So long pent up, and as she thought abus'd: Resolv'd to try if yet her ancient Fame, Could raise her up to a more glorious Name: And guided by the Star which rul'd her Fate, At last she met with one more fortunate, Then her old Foster Father was: And he (Fraught with the store of rich ability.) Bravely adorn'd her, taught her how to speak Translated by Mr. Rich. Fanshaw, and dedicated to the Prince that then was. A Courtly Language, and thereby to break Through all the Mists of dark obscurity, As one now fitted for a Princes Eye. This rare adventure, wrought a strange conceit In this'more lowly Minion, that my streit, And rigid resolution held so long, To Coop them up, had done them both some wrong For whilest I gave her Sister leave to walk, From hand to hand by stealth, she heard men talk Of gracious Favours, and Aspects, cast on her By Noble persons, and by men of Honour; And thence concludes, 'twas onely want of scope To fly abroad which thus destroid her hope. And that her self (though meanly pris'd by me) Might have attaind the same felicitie: These fond ambitious Thoughts; and sad Laments Grounded upon her groundless discontents, Have forc't me yeild unto her mournful plaint And loose the Fetters of her hard restraint. Granting her leave to roam abroad at large, Yet not without this strict, and serious charge That she should not presume to think her Name Could purchase her, or me, a lasting Fame; Nor yet expect, that her best industrie Could raise her up unto the least degree Of Grace and Favour, with judicious men, Who know the failings of my erring Pen; But rather that she should conform her mind To my mean fortune, as unlike to find A way to better hopes, as I am free. From those aspiring thoughts, which use to be In men of greater Parts, whose merits may, Challenge a due respect, where worth bears sway: And since she could not be content to dwell In my poor quiet, though but homely Cell, Where she might have been free from all the wrongs Of envious hearts, and of malicious tongues, That yet she would put on an humble guise A modest garb, without desire to rise Unto an higher pitch then well may sute With the bare purchase of a fair Repute.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my much Honoured Friend, Mr. J. S. upon his Translation of Filli di Sciro. How hath thy cruel modesty betray'd To dark Imprisonment this beautious Maid. And rob'd thy Country of so rich a piece. As honoured Italy, and out did Greece, While in obedience to thy strict command She silent languisht, This Comedy was Translated long ago by M. [illeg.] S. and layd by, as also was Pastor Fido, which was once Translated and set forth by Mr. R. [illeg.] Fanshaw. yet could understand And speak our Language perfect, as her own: A virtue not oth' Sex, but hers alone. Her Sister in Imprisonment got free But ow'd to other hands her Liberty, And had such taking Ayres, that she was grown The Courted Beauty here as soon as known: Nor needst thou fear, this meets unequal grace, Being her equal both in birth and Face: She's no exposed Issue, but as we When Pastures shewen, done by great hands, do see Without severe examining apart The Colours, Postures, Symetrie and Art. Crie a rare-piece, so much to Fame we owe Of th' Authors skil confirmed long ago; So when her Fathers name as great as theirs, For Limning souls, and painting loves and sears Is read upon her Front the Noble piece Hath double estimate, that's Go d, and His. Break forth then Innocent sweetness, and shine bright As the fair Morn, The Night supposed immediately to precede the opening of this Scene, and the Morn immediately succeeding in which this Pastorall begins, being one full of horror, the other of bright light, both described in the first Scene. which did succeed that Night So dark and hideous, that men thought the Sun And Nature at a stand, their last course run; When taught by fear th' amazed world did say There needed new Creation to make day, Which yet sprang with such sweetness and delight They wisht there never would succeed a night Shine forth so fair; and teach our wanton youth To hate their perjuries, and honour truth. That the soft Virgins may no more complain, Mens falshood, and their wronged loves made vain; But let thy great example strike an awe Into their souls, as binding as the Law. Which may into both Sexes still dispense In Love, success; in Wisdome, innocence. Taught by thy virtues thus, they both will pray No Night may ere ore-take thy glorious day. Which long and fair I as a Prophet could Foretel should last, and as a Poet would Create new Fate for thee, were thine not great. But thou hast perfect temper, and thy heat Drawn from the Sun and purer part oth' Sky Predicts, and causes immortality. And not to be by lines describ'd and shown Less Artful and Immortal then thine own. I. H.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. NIGHT. Stay now my quick wing'd Coursers, stay your flight So long at least as till I may find out What strange unusual wonder hath possest This earthly Globe, and what rare virtue lives Which hath the power, within so short a space, Thus to transform the world. And in the interim let th' Antipodes, These strange unknown inhabitants which dwel, Below this Sphere, injoy the pleasing light Of the daies burning Lamp, beyond their wont; And you swift-wing'd Damsels that attend Still on my person, for a time suspend Your hasty flight (as once before you did, When the renown'd Alcides was conceiv'd) And let the restlesse Spokes and whirling Nathes, Of my Eternal Chariot on the proud Aspiring back of towring Atlas rest; Nor let the shining God which by his beams, Makes such a difference in your borrowed lights, Seem discontent that I usurp a while, Upon the time prescribed for my raign, In our devided Empire; for himself Whil'st once he needs would stay, to be a kind Spectator of anothers Victory, Held in his hand his burning torch beyond The limits of his hours, so to befriend That brave Heroick Hebrew in the fight. He made against the opposers of his might: But least perhaps the knowledge who I am, Should seem as dark to any, as my looks, And this my gloomy visage seems obscure, Let them that do desire to know my name, And what the truth of my condition is, Behold this Sable Chariot and observe, These golden trappings, and from thence collect, Both who, and what I am: The heedlesse rout Of the self-heady multitude, do call Me impious Nurse of Error, mother of Enchantments, and foul horror, and a friend To Vice, and wickednesse: But I am she, That do produce true Mirth and Jollity, The quaint allayer of unquiet thoughts, The sole dispencer of sweet pleasing dreams, And Universal rest. Great Queen of Shades, Eternal Warrior, That lead under the Colours which I bear, Adorn'd with silver spangles, Legions of Bright shining Stars, which do incamp me round; Whilst I arm'd all in darknesse do destroy, The glorious day, and after crown'd with lights, And carried through this spacious Hemisphere, In this eternal Chariot do triumph, Over the day so foild. 'Tis I, that to you Mortals shew the Mines Of precious Saphires, and the treasure of Immortal Carbuncles, and so divide Into a world of sparks, one fire alone, As shews a thousand shining Suns for one. Night, night, the daughter of the earth I am, Do you not know me you blest lovers? Can You now forget her? whom you oft have call'd, The faithful Secretary of your close, And amorous thefts? how many times have I Conceal'd you under my black gloomy shades, Whilest you have secretly past free from sight, To reap your stoln delights? And you young Damsels, what sweet hidden joys, What private pleasures have you of't injoy'd Under the shadow of my dusky raies? How often by the gentle virtue of This my sweet gentle son, although he be Deaths elder brother; have I chear'd your faint And wearied spirits, and restor'd you to The powers of life again: and shutting up Your dull dim eyes, have let your fancies see Those pleasing Images of Loves best joys, Which rapt your souls into a Paradice Of amorous delights. To you at least, I cannot but be dear, (If I be not deceiv'd) Magnanimous Brave Heroes, since I alone am she By whom your everlasting monuments, Describ'd in glistering characters of gold, And written in the spacious volume of The vast celestial sphere, amongst my clear, Bright shining signs, do live eternally: Environ'd there, with troops of glorious Stars, Amongst a thousand others clearly shines He that so many cruel Monsters queld: Nor can I doubt, but I shall be as dear To you my amorous spectators, who Within your sweet aspects, do sweetly bear Beauty and Love, since all my care is how To imitate in my bright shining Lamps, The glorious beams which shine out of your eyes, And since the Goddesse of rich beauty, and That lovely Star, which gently doth inspire Into your gentle hearts the flames of Love, Is not the least of those bright Sisters, which Attend upon my train. From you I therefore do desire to know, The cause of this so rare an accident: What is it I behold here? is not this, The Isle of Scyros, this the River where, Led by the power of Fate, the Thracian ship, All rent and torn, so lately furled up Her weather-beaten sails? 't is not long since I saw the brinish Waves, fall swoln with pride, So raise their fierce aspiring rage, against High Heaven it self, as that together with Those other Fishes which instead of Scales, Are all adorned with bright shining stars, The swift Celestial Dolphin might have swum, Within the neighbouring Sea. 'T is not long since I saw those flashing beams, With blazing Ensigns of hot burning flames, Run through the spacious Region of the Air, And every minute threaten this whole Isle, With endlesse Battels of confounding blasts, And ever showring Rain. Loud claps of Thunder, with their roaring noise, As Trumpets of the universe were heard, Now here, now there, in those confused wars, Of all the troubled Elements to sound The bold defiance of the winds. Impetuous Whirl-winds, with most horrid flaws, Those blustring Combatants might then be seen, With fearful Shocks to Just and Tourney both In a fierce Duel 'twixt them two fought here, Within the circuit of this Hemisphere: Then tell me Mortals, tell me who is he, To whom high Heaven hath vouchsaf't that Grace, To reconcile the disagreeing jars, Of such fierce enemies, and settle them Thus in a friendly peace. Who is it that clears up my duskie looks? Dries my now humide Mantle? and thus gilds My sable hair? that was so lately hung, With dangling Pearls of cold congealed hail, And moistned in the fogs of cloudy mysts? What new created light thus forceth me To change my innate quality? Behold The late distemper'd Heavens seem to smile, The waters smile, the earth adorn'd with flowers Opens her fruitful bosome, and displaies Her various store, in emulation of My brighter April stars. I see no more now of a Tempest here, But flashing beams of Honour, blazing lights, Of Love and Beauty: O rare Miracle, What cannot the all powerfull virtue of Divine Celestial beauty bring to passe? Yours be the thanks blest eyes, in whose Serene Triumphant Arches, still so clearly shines A gentle Rainbow, which can pacifie, Not winds and storms alone, but all the Gusts Of a disturbed Soul. But Oh! what glorious raies now dart their light Upon my gloomy visage? What bright Lamp, With too much splendor blinds my feeble sight? Though like an immense Peacock I do bear, Within my train the sparkling glory of A thousand glittering eyes, yet all come short Of this so bright an object, and as one That still'd sires to gaze upon so clear, So rich a Paradice of beauty; now I wish I had a thousand more. But stay! for there me thinks I see the Sun, Eternal Painter, now begin to rise, And Limn the Heavens, in Vermilian Dye, And having dipt his Pencil, aptly fram'd Already in the colour of the Morn, With various temper, he doth mix in one, Darknesse and light: And drawing curiously, Straight golden lines, quite thwart the duskie skie, A rough draught of the day he seems to yeeld, With Red and Tawny in an Azure Field. Already by the clattring of their Bits, Their gingling harnesse, and their neighing sound, I hear Eous, and fierce Pirous, Come panting at my back: and therefore I, Must flie away, and yet I do not flie. But follow on my regulated course, And those eternal Ordors I receiv'd From the first mover of the Universe, I do not flie the dawning of the day, For envy of the light, or those bright raies, Which deck the beauty of the blushing morn; I do not flie the Sun, because I think It any shame to me, that he should thus Follow, and drive me now away from hence; No, no, I flie (white snowy foreheads) from Your clearer morning light, I flie, I flie. (Fair beauteous eyes) from your bright shining beams; Not that I scorn to be o'recome by them, By whom the Sun is proud to be out-shin'd, And dazeled with their light: but I am loath To break the laws of Love, and 'tis Loves law, That all the turns of Nature should subject Themselves to change; and I should not retard My quick return too long, to them that live Beyond this Sphere, and now expect me there. Thou then kind sleep, free those dull eyes that lie, Opprest with slumber; and thou silence tie, Mens busie tongues, that this day all the world, May with kind looks, and tacite thoughts behold, The admirable fortune and rare fate, Of Thirsis and fair Phillis those two blest, Procurers of this Islands happy rest, And you dear daughters of the humide air, Begotten by the influence of the Moon, You fruitfull nourishers of herbs and flowers, Fresh morning Dews, now shut your silver Urns; For now the fields have satisfied their thirst, And meads have drunk their fill: Flie you swift hours And lightly hasten to the latest step, Of that large scale, by which I use to passe, Beyond the bounds of this Horizon, Flie. And you bright followers of Cinthia, now Pursue the dance which to the Harmony, Of the Celestial Spheres, you use to tread Upon the Airs vast Theater, and whilst Sweet pleasing Musick fills the courteous ears, Of all these beautifull Spectators here.

Behold the dawning light, give ear unto The gentle murmurings of the morning Air, Which is high Heavens sacring Bell, that calls The drowsie birds, to pay their homage to The rising Sun. And tell me then, if ever man yet saw, So fair a morning, breath so sweet a gale, Out of the gloomy bosome of so foul a night? See with what dear delight it seems to steal The Stars from Heaven, and store the earth with Flowers, O blessed Banks! do not these Roses look, Like stars sent from their sphere to adorn this Brook? Sir. It seems a dream Melisso, for of late The world was out of course; the troubled Clouds Labour'd, as over-whelmed with the Sea; And the bright Heavens as darkned with her Waves, Thunder-bolts shot themselves through furious Gusts, Which threatned nothing but a boisterous storm, And ever now, and then, a fearfull light, Blaz'd from the skies; which by those flashing beams, Seem'd in a triumph to shew forth their power. The blustring winds strove by their whirling blasts, To shake the deep foundations of the earth: Instead of rain, the rivers swoln with pride, And scorning to be kept within the Banks, Of muddy clay, seem'd to out-face the Air; And I amazed cried, shall then the earth, Be by another Sea from Heaven o're-whelm'd? To tell the truth, I durst not then presume, To stir out of my Cell surpris'd with fear, To look upon the Weather-beaten fields: Or see these flowers all torn up by the roots, And view the Corn lie shaken with the storm, Here boughs torn from the trees, there trees rent up, And every where th'unhappy Trophies then Of Heaven warring against sinfull men. And yet, behold I see these gentle Plants Adorn'd, and deckt, with their green tresses still. There's not a leaf, which faln from off a Bow, Lies withered by the tree, from which it fell. Each Valley, Meadow, and each fertile field, More fruitful now then ever, do I see, Enamel'd with fair flowers, mixt with green hearbs, And braging as it were, of heavens high Grace. O Wonderfull! shall then the injuries Of heaven, become Earths greatest happiness? And such foul stormes produce such fruitfulness? Mel. Sireno, heaven never varies from these Laws, And these Eternall bounds, to which its ty'd; But it foretels some fearful prodigie; For 'tis the Master of all future chance. And all the lights, and all the turns it brings, Are tongues which talk in a celestial tone: And if it Thunder, or send lightning forth, Even that's a muttering language, which it speaks. And haply, this vain terrour, which the night Brought upon us fond men, to which succeeds, Beyond all humane hope, so blith a morn, Is sent from thence, to tell us that we may, After a short tempestuous storm of sad annoy, Hope for the chearfull beams of unexpected joy. Sir. Alas, Melisso, can it be beleev'd? If Heaven had care of us, the Sun would sure; Rather then thus display his glorious beams, Conceal himself under those watry clouds, From looking on these certain miseries, Which now attend us. Know'st thou not then, that on this wofull shore, Oronte is arriv'd, the Minister Of the Great King, and of our endlesse Woe? Mel. I know it not, who came but yesternight, Just at the setting of the evening Sun, With Cloris my dear daughter from the holy Isle, Whither we went, as you know very well, At the beginning of the youthfull spring: And since in Scyros I have made abode, Where I already have beheld the fields, Three times wax yellow with the Summers heat And thrice grow hoary with the Winters Frost. I cannot call to mind, that ere I saw, Any such man come here. Sir. 'Tis true he comes not, but each fifteen years, Yet leaves a sad remembrance here behind Of an eternal Woe. O Melisso, Melisso, ere thou see'st Th' unlucky Batt, flie through the dusky air, Or hear'st the night Owl shriek, thou yet shalt hear, The wofull plaints of silly Infants, sound The deep laments of Scyros. But I must go, for time calls me, to hast Unto the Temple, to adore the Gods. Mel. The Temple is yet shut; and is not far Distant from hence, here we may stay a while, Under this bright and spacious Hemisphere, Untill the Sun send out his golden raies, To gild the silver skies, and so extract The morning beams, out of this dawning light: Then with the rising Sun, and not before, The sacred Priest sets ope the Temple dore: And in the interim, thou may'st here inform Me, who this man is, what those ills he brings, From whence and wherefore he arrived here. For loves-sake, let me know, our common greeves, That whilest all others mourn, I may not be Carelesse alone to wail our misery. Sir. I'le tell thee then Meliss' and thou shalt hear, In two short sighs, our long continued woes; Thou canst not but already understand, That when the Thracian bold, Grand Signior first Mel. O sad beginning from a Tyrants name! Sir. Subdu'd unto his barbarous Empire all, The Towns and Cities seated round the Coasts Of the Ãgean Sea. He a most cruel tribute then impos'd. Not of fine Wool, nor of our woolly flocks, Not of our horned Heards, of Gold or Gems, The baser off-spring, of Dame Natures Womb; But of our proper Children, which to us Are the dear gifts of Heaven, of those sweet Imps, And tender Infants, which from two years old Had not yet breath'd out five years of their Age. Mel. I know it well. Sir. He then doth every fifteen years imploy A Captain, from these Coasts, to bear away Those pretty little slaves, who from each place, Some ten, a hundred, or a thousand takes; According as the place abounds in store. And from this most unhappy Island here, Great onely in the sorrows which it feels, Twenty, and twenty, he exacts by course, Such as amongst a thousand chosen first By his own will, shall by a cursed lot, Be destin'd to his power: That cursed lot, which fifteen years agone Made poor Ormino, and my self, become, Above all forlorn Parents, most forlorn; (Alas I cannot hold from sad laments, Each minute that I think on't.) Then, then, I say, this self same man, this same Oronte, snatcht from him Thirsis his son, From me my daughter Phillis, and from both Our very hearts; O me most wretched man! Mel. Could not the children of Ormino then, And of Siren, which are descended from The great Achilles, those young Imps of love Through whom all Scyros is so famous grown Be spar'd in Scyros? Is there no regard In Kings, to those that are deriv'd from Kings? Sir. O no Melisso, no; Kings Royal blood, Without a Royal Scepter brings smal good: And who dos't thou beleeve, would think to find Under a lowly Hut, a Shepheards Weed Amidst our simple manners, Royal Seed? Mel. If men cannot, Sireno, yet Heaven should, Bright Heaven, which sees, what yet the Sun nere saw And Heaven may one day yet some pitty take, And some Compassion of our Misery: But tell me then, is he that's here arriv'd, A Thracian Captain, and a Thracian born? Sir. A Thracian of Bisantium, and the great Servant, and Favorite of the Thracian King (If all be true, which when his fatal foot Last trode in Scyros, I was made beleeve) And his great charge it is to take a care, Of all these tributes upon which his thoughts Are so intentive, as he hath not past One day of his due time since fifteen yeers Are this day just compleat, and he return'd Hither again, to renovate our woes. As if both Winds and Waters had conspir'd, To bring him flying hither. Mel. No more, new cares even now suggest themselves Unto my thoughts, and bid me hast away. Sir. Go, and be happy, as thy heart can wish, And I will to the Temple bend my steps: And thence unto the place, where under Tents Oronte lies lodg'd by the Ocean shore, To learn at least, if my poor Phillis came Alive unto the Thracian strand. Scen 2. Cloris. Melisso. Clo. Celia, my Celia: But shee's not here, nor answers to my call. Mel. Ah daughter Cloris! Clo. Alas my father! whither now so fast? Why with so sad a look? Mel. To thee I come my child. Clo. To me so troubled? woes me what's the cause? What is the sad misfortune that you bring? Mel. Thracians arriv'd in Scyros: to this shore, Death comes conducted by thine enemies: Thou know'st too well, how that great Tyrant seeks, And thirsteth for thy bloud. Clo. Ah me Thirsis, Ã´ Thirsis! Ah my dearest Soul! Mel. But fear not daughter; and yet prithee fear, Fear, yea and tremble too; a surer Guard, Then fear is, cannot now preserve thee safe; In thine own hands thy welfare then consists; And to a tender maidens heart, an easier help Cannot be well prescrib'd then fear. Clo. You are deceiv'd Sir: Heaven yet denies To grant me such a favour, as to fear: Whil'st I am unresolv'd, and cannot learn, Whether my Thirsis be alive or dead. I cannot well tell whether I should fear, Or rather seek mine end, O Thirsis, Thirsis! If I a thousand times on thy loud name Have cal'd in vain, at least in this so great, So suddain danger, answer me, and say, Art thou alive or dead? Dead or alive my Thirsis, tell me, Dear Where must I seek thee out, amongst the cold And naked shadows of uncloathed souls, Or amongst living Men? Mel. Poor silly fool; See how her fancy raves Still upon love: Dost thou beleeve that death Bears such an Amorous look, that thou darst play Thus with thy love, whilest he sits on thy Brow? Clo. If my lov'd Thrisis be amongst the dead, Death cannot but seem lovely then to me. And if perhaps (dear Father) you have sought Out of a needless pitty to my woe, Still to conceal his death: High Heaven then (I know not which to say) Reward, or pardon, this your pious fraud, For what is past already: But since Fate By these rude Thracians hands, doth open now, So large a Path unto my wished end; Cease then at last that merciful deceit, Which is to me so cruel: For if death Have seiz'd upon my Thirsis, then I know That Death and He expect me both below. And since he sees me now so neer the Bark That may transport me thither, loe me thinks I see him come to meet me: and whilest he Kinde loving soul, puts forth his hand to me, Shall I turn back from him? Ay me! Mel. With those deep sighs, let all thy fancies end, Thy Thirsis lives, I say, thy Thirsis lives; But thou art too incredulous: I oft Have sworn by Heaven and Earth tis true; yet thou Wilt not beleeve it; see I swear again, Again he lives, and to thy love he lives, And to thy Spousal Rites, and to thy Life His Life he still preserves. Clo. Is it then true, and may it be beleev'd? Lives yet my Thirsis? shall I ever see That day, when I may see him once again? Mel. Thou shalt, if thou wilt but attend the time: Clo. But when, how long, how long shall that time be? Mel. Not long: Dost thou not see that Heaven which brings And Marshals all our days, is restless still, And in continual motion hastens on With all the speed it can? Suffer the Fates then to produce their Will In their appointed time, and force them not By an abortive Birth to bring thy Hopes, To an untimely end. Clo. What shall I doe then, where, which way shall I Defend my Life from cruel Thracians Hands, Already I do fear and tremble. Mel. Even Hope it self, hath taught thee now to fear. Clo. Will you that in the Fields, the Woods, the Caves I hide my self, or seek remoter parts? Mel. But what remoter Parts can be found out, Where thou mayst follow either Beasts or Heards, And not a Thracian trace thee by thy steps. A Fair young Maid, if she remain alone In secret places, cannot be secure Where Thracians walk the Round. Clo. Will you that then I Sail-unto the Rocks? Thither 'tis certain neither Beasts nor Heards Can draw the greedy Thracians to pursue me, Ile go, and if I cannot finde a Barke Ready to waft me from this luckless Shore, Though yet the troubled Sea, be not at rest Ile Swim to save my Life. Mel. Fear makes thee now too bold: shal a weak Maid By swimming, dare to press the angry Waves Of a tumultuous Sea? Swim to the Rocks? No, no, my Child, not in a well Rigd Boat. The Coast is full of People, on the Shore The Thracian Captain, keeps his Residence. Clo. Is there no way left for me to escape? Mel. I with my Hooks and Nets, will towards the Sea, Direct my steps, pretending there to fish, And so shall spie which way the Thracians tend, And 'ert be long return to thee again With a more sure advice. Clo. And wretched I, what shall I do the while? Mel. Wait here abouts, in open view of all, Th' art yet secure, and till I shall return Leave all the care to me: Let none perceive That either flight or fear, sits on thy Brow: If Nimphs come here for shade, doubt not to put Thy self into their company, discourse, And laugh, and play, and pass the time away. If thus the Thracians finde thee with thy fears, Thou mayst perhaps pass unregarded. And yet I know not how those eyes of thine Send forth a sparkling light, which cannot shine, In any eyes besides; it shewes it self But too too glorious, such resplendant beams Cannot remain conceal'd. Let fall thy hair in some quaint wanton guise Over thy forehead, that in part it may Cover those darting looks: The less thou shewst, Fair as thou art the less thou shalt appear Like to thy self. Clo. See not my hair alone dis-cheveld, but My Vail let loose; Oh me I'm too too rude. Mel. And yet th'art not less fair, but thy best guard Consists in the discretion of thy words. Dost thou remember what was taught thee, when Thou wert a little pratling Girle: Canst thou Answer to him shall ask thee who thou art? Clo. Yes, very well. Mel. Answer me then. What is thy name? Clo. Cloris, Mel. Where wert thou born? Clo. In Smyrna. Mel. Who begot thee there? Clo. Melisso of Armilla. Mel. Thirsis? Clo. I know not who you mean. Mel. Eillis? Clo. I understand you not. Mel. Thracia? Clo. I never yet was there. Mel. Right, right, 'tis right, such thy Answers be Beware of faultring if thou love thy life. Does no man here us? See there comes a Nymph Down from the Wood. Clo. Oh, oh 'tis Celia, Shee that hath my heart, Shee whom I wandred up and down to find. Mel. Stay then with her. Scen. 3. Cloris. Celia. Clo. O my sweet Celia, Scarce had I rob'd The Fertile Earth of a few fragrant Flowers. Before I lost the sight of the: But why Turn'st thou away those eyes, and why those steps In such a troubled guise? dost thou disdain That I should look upon thee once again? What suddain change is this? when first I came, This morning to thy Lodg, scarce didst thou deign To entertain me with a seeming smile: Which yet discovered plainly that thy Heart Answered not to thy looks: and when thou then With thy neglecting Arms didst make a shew, As if thou wouldst embrace me, thou didst not Hug me close in thy bosom: but at last From thy cold frozen Lips, thou didst let fall; Not dart a kiss at me, and with a soft Dull fainting voice, I knew not if thou saidst Th'art welcome Cloris, but 'tis sure enough, I could not here thee say, as thou wert wont, (Whilst I was dear to thee) my life, my heart, My gentle Cloris welcome. After all this thou gav'st thy self to stray, And wander up and down, troubled and sad, I follow thee, thou flyest, I speak, thou wilt not answer me, I look upon thy lovely Face, thou weepest, And dost thou hate me then ingrateful Wench What have I done, that could deserve thy hate? Or rather, what 'ist that I have not done To make thee love me? Are we still the same That we were wont to be? Am I still Cloris, art thou Celia? Celia. O grief that Wounds my Heart, Ah grant me but So short a respit as may give me leave To answer her, and yet conceal my grief. Clo. And wilt thou thou then discurtious as thou art, Deny to me a part of these lost words which thou so freely spendest in the Ayr? Who must I speak to now, since thou deniest To give me Answer? What 'ist I must doe? Ayme, since thou, who only heretofore, Wert wont to lessen my tormenting pains, Art now she that torments me? but allas, This happily is some prodigious signe, Of my more desperate ruine, and perhaps High Heaven hath decreed, my tears shall be Eternal, since it now denyes to stay Her that was wont to wipe them all away. Celia. Ah Cloris, Ah my Life! Clo. That same, my Life, comes from thy mouth per force. I know it well enough, 'twas not thy Heart That sent it thither. Celia. Let them dissemble then that can, my Tongue Cannot tell how to give my heart the lye; Hear me then Cloris, and I do not say Life, of my Life, because my Life to me, Is now a burden; but thou art not so. I am no more that Celia, that I was. Tis true: but what so ere I am, I fly, And hate my self, not thee: Thus far thou mayst know of me, but no more; Permit me then to wander still alone, In secret horrors of the savage Woods, Where through obscurity of darksome shades I may not see my self. Clo. Ahyme, what new malignant Star Hath Heaven produc't that can compel thy grief, Thus to neglect it self? and shall I then Forsake thee too? Not till I know thy ill. Yet what but love, and his most intricate Turmoyls, can trouble thus thy happy state? I oft have heard the wisest lovers say He knows no grief, that knows not loves delay. For else what can it be? unless perhaps, (And can that bring so great a misery? Mongst other Nimphs upon some solemn day; Thy Darts or Arrows, have not cleft the Mark; Or by misfortune, happily thou hast lost Thy goodly Ivory Bow: I see it not Hang by thy side: Or is thy gentle Kid Thy dearest dear delight (and this 'tis true Is the most sad mishap ill luck can send) Is he, I say, come to untimely end? Celia. He was at least the cause of all my woe For by his means I did become the prey Of Eurito the Centaur: whence arose The spring and sourse of all my misery, Clo. Wert thou the Centaurs prey? and how? and when? Do not conceal so strange an accident. Colia. Ile tell it thee, but ask me then no more. Clo. Be it as thou wilt have it. Celia. Hear then, and when I have declar'd, The mournful story of my ravishment Be thou content to leave me here alone. Clo. Go on I prethee. Celia. That very day when thou (about to take Thy journey to those Solemn Festivals, Which in the Holy Isle they celebrate To the great Goddess) camest to take thy leave, Of me at my poor Cell: I to restrain Those Tears which thy departure forct me to, (As if I had foreseen (woes me) that soon, I should have have far more urgent cause to give Full scope to their impetuous Torrent) I gave my self the liberty to sport And dally with that nimble frisking Kid: Whose gentle Gamesomeness, was wont to chear All my sad froward thoughts; whilest they were such, As could admit of any gamesomeness. That harmless Beast, or in his harmless shape My perverse fortune, by a thousand trains Of wanton sports, entic't me to that Shore Where the proud Sea hath wrought it self so near Unto the Woods, that shaddows seem to swim, And flouds repose themselves under the shade. There whilst I spent some time to gather up Such Cockle Shels, as Nature had adorn'd With various pride, that I might weave them streight, Into a collor for my pretty Kid, Behinde me I could hear the rushing noise Of a rude boisterous creature, and ere scarce I well could turn mine eyes, I might perceive Close at my back, I know not which to say A man or beast: Whose fury came so fast, As flung the smaller Sands into my face, And forc't me shut mine eyes: Thus neither seeing how, nor yet by whom, I felt my self snatcht up and born away. Fain would I have cryed out, but my weak voice, Not daring to put forth it self, retired And fled in silence to my throbbing Heart. Whilest I, as one half dead, could not recall My straggling sences back, till I was brought Into the inmost parts of those thick Woods. And found my self become the wretched prey, Of a most horrid Monster. I found my self (and tremble yet to think What then I found) close graspt within the Arms Of that mishapen Centaur, that foul fiend, Whom thou mayst yet if thou hast so much heart, Lodg'd in thine eyes, behold and wonder at Thy self, within the Temple. Clo. Alas my hair stands upright on an end To hear him but describ'd. Celia. There, to a sturdy Oak, he bound me fast And re-enforct his base inhumane bonds With the then danglinst Tresses of my hair, Ingrateful hair, ill-nurtur'd wicked Locks! The cruel wretch then took up from the foot Both my loose tender garments, and at once Rent them from end to end: Imagine then Whether my crimson red, through shame was chang'd Into a pale wan tincture, yea or no. I that was looking towards Heaven then, And with my cries imploring ayd from thence, Upon a suddain to the Earth let fall My shamefac't eyes, and shut them close, as if Under mine eye-lids, I could cover all My naked Members, but considering well His fell intent, with a deep groaning sigh, To him I said, behold me ready now Fit for thy ravenous throat, come quickly, come, And satiate thy beastly hunger. Clo. And why his hunger, say, poor silly wretch? Celia. That being once devour'd, I might at least Within his paunch conceal my nakedness. Clo. And dost thou then beleeve, that Centaurs use To feed upon young tender Maids? Celia. Nerea beleeves it not, but laught aloud When first I told it her; but prithee say, Why should he so desire to have me bound, And naked as I was but that he might Swallow me up alive, and with more ease Conveigh me piece-meal gliding down his throat? And even then he came with open Arms, And snatcht to gripe me by the naked Brest, When, lo, two Shepheads running fast for hast Came in unto my rescue. Clo. Oh! how my heart's reviv'd! and who were those Whom Heaven in pitty chose out for thine ayde? Celia. Amyntas, old Sirenos Son, whose joy And whole delights in Hunting, with his friend Niso, a stranger, whom thou dost not know. Ay me poor soul! Clo. What! art thou sighing still? Celia. I have good cause. Clo. But how came it to pass that in a place So far remote, two Shepherds should arrive Both at one instance? Celia. Amyntas, was within the Valley where He stood to Watch his Toyls, and Niso came From the Sea shore, whither but then the Winds Had brought him from a Country far away, And both brought thither by my shrieking cries: They both arriv'd together; where the one Lets fly his Dart, the other shoots a Shaft, And neither one nor other mist his aime. The cruel Centaur thus but lightly hurt In his left shoulder, and in his right arme Lost some small blood, which was supply'd with rage: And so betwixt them three, there soon begun A fierce and bloody fight, till that proud beast Scorning that two such Stripling should have power So to withstand his fury, thought at once To strike a deadly blow, by which he meant To speed them both, and brandashing his Beam, The Tree which happily some pitty felt Of my sad state, did so involve it in The knotty intricacies of his boughs, As it fell from his hand: And he that found his Arme thus without armes, And without heart, his heart betook him streight To a most shameful slight, and from the Woods Whilest he up towards the Mountains took his way It was his fortune to fall in those Toyls Which to catch other beasts, Amyntas had Before plac't in the Vale. Clo. And so the insolent proud villain was Himself made now their prey. Celia. The Shepherds followed him; but yet not far Ere they fell to the Earth, through loss of blood, Which from their wounds did like a Torrent flow, And ran even to my feet, sad Messenger Of their approaching ends, to crave mine ayd. I shall now tell thee Cloris, what will seem A wonder to thee, yet it is most true: Pitty to see their case, made me to strain My self with so much force, as I got free From all my bonds, even from those self same bonds I freed my self, to give another aide, Which I a thousand times had tried before For mine own safety, and could not unloose. When I was free, I had almost for hast Run to them naked; but consider now A strange affection. Clo. And what hast thou told yet, that is not strange? Celia. When I was got where those two Shepherds lay Half dead, half living, and in reason should Have stopt their bleeding wounds up with my Vail, I first beheld the one, and then the other, To this I went and afterwards to that, Desiring still to help them both at once, And yet gave help to neither, as not well Resolv'd to whom I first should lend my help; At last I did begin, but knew not where, And whilst my hand, was busie about one My heart ran to the other, so that I Could not well know to which I wisht more ease. Clo. What didst thou do at last? Celia. All that I could, yet all was nothing worth: Till those same fearful howlings, which 'gainst Heaven, That horrid Monster sent up from the Toils Made all the Valleys far and neer to Ring, And drew both Nimphs and Sheapherds to those parts, Where when they came, too soon to them appears Two over-whelm'd in blood, and one in tears. They speedily conveigh'd the wounded pair To old Sirenos House, the Father of Poor young Amyntas. Clo. And live they yet? yet their strength restor'd? Celia. I cannot tell. Clo. And canst thou take so little care for those Who for thy safety thus ingaged their lives? Sure thou art too ingrate. Celia. Cloris, no more, this is the Period, when I must enjoyn thee silence, thou hast heard All that thou didst demand, now let me part; Ay me, what do I see? Clo. What hath she espyed out there? why did she turn Her steps so suddainly another way? Ho! Celia, it is a Shepherd, and I think, It be Amyntas. Scen. 4. AMYNTAS. Thanks be to Heaven, I am now return'd Once more to Sollace in these fertile Fields To breath in open Ayr, and to behold This glorious Sun again; Ye Sacred Gods, If when to you I sent my humble prayers, You did restore life to my liveless Limbs, Give now a lively spirit to my soul Whilest I with true devotion pay my vows, And lowly thus adore this blessed Sun. I do adore the Sun; but where alas, Where is the Suns fair Idol, which above This Sun I must adore? I pay my vows Unto the Sun that hath restor'd my life? But woes me, where is she that is my life? I cannot see thee my sweet Celia, and yet Thou art alone the life I must implore And thou the Idol which I must adore. Where art thou then, where dost thou hide thy self? Celia that art the brightness of the Spheres, Sent like a flash of lightening, first to smite My tender heart, and then to vanish quite, Thou fleddest from me then, when I could not Remove my foot from deaths infernal snare: But into what part canst thou wander now Whither I will not follow thee, through Woods Through lowly Valleys, and ore Mountains Tops: I will pursue the still, though still in vain, I hunt thy footsteps with Eternal pain. It shall be my delight to lick the Earth, Where thy fair foot hath trod; it may be known, By the sweet Flowers, where they do thickest grow. It shall be my delight to suck the Ayr, Which once hath kist thy Face; it may be known By the calm blasts where they do sweetest blow. It shall be my delight still to admire, And still admiring, seek thy beautious Rays Amongst Vermillian Roses, and amongst The whitest Lillies, and the fairest Flowers; Amongst the glittering Stars, and in that Shpere, Where the bright Sun most glorious doth appear. But yet fond fool in vain mine eyes do gaze First up to Heaven, and then down on Earth; I see the Sun, Roses and Gilliflowers, But cannot see my Celia, without whom The Sun in all his glory gives no light, Nor the best colour'd flowers can please my sight. O you dead semblances of lively worth, You are too dull displayers of her rich, Of her diviner beauty; come my dear, My dearest Celia come, for thou alone Art to mine eyes, thine own true Paragon: But hear I not one whistle here hard by, Is it not Niso? sure it must be he: And then he's in pursuit to find me out; My dear beloved Niso, he cannot Without me well stay long in any place: For since he lately came to make abode With us in Scyros here, the Sun by day, Nor yet the Stars by night have never seen Him far off from my side. What then shall I doe now, or how can I Conceal from him, what turns love hath produc't Within my amorous Soul? I yet am but Young in loves school; but he hath learn't to love From his first infancy, and now he bears Grave ancient love, in lusty youthful years; I may do well then to disclose my self To him, whose long experience is fit To give me good advice, and so procure, Some help to ease me in my misery. But shall Amyntas then, Amyntas who Hath ever been a hunter, and profest Himself an open enemy to love, Confess himself to be a lover now? I am in love, but shame to say I am; I therefore will take her advice that was The Mistress of loves School, I will make known The love, but not the lover, and so frame Means to conceal my self, yet shew my flame. Scen. 5. AMYNTAS. NISO. Amyntas. Whether Oh Niso? Nis. To Amyntas, but Whether without his Niso, doth Amyntas go? Amyn. Unto the Temple, I: Niso. And thither I will bear thee company. But let me here Amyntas breath a while, For I begin to faint; my hurt is cur'd, But yet my feet tread not a steddy pace: They tremble still, and still my dazling eyes Deceive my sight, so that it seems my heart Dare not rest confident on either part. Amynt. No marvel, since we scarcely yet have left Those beds of sloth, wherein we both have lien Wounded, and kept in dark obscurity So long, that thrice the love-sick Moon hath woed The Sun to re-inforce her borrowed light. Niso. Yet thou so lightly o'r these rugged fields Do'st hast away, as I can scarce pursue Thy foot-steeps with mine eyes. Amynt. O Niso! such a sweetness seems to breath Of late, me-thinks, from earth and heaven both, As 'tis no wonder if it do deceive My trembling limbs, though faint with loss of blood, Since it already hath deceiv'd my heart; Which, as if I had never touch'd the ground, Hath brought me flying hither. Niso. Some woody Deity perhaps hath caught My gentle young Amyntas in his arms, To waft him o'r the Plains. Amynt. Mock not, dear Nisis, no, it was a God, Beleev't it was, but a celestial God; No Godhead of the Woods, a God with wings, That without wings can teach us men to fly. But I disclose my self too far. Niso. Some jest or other now thou fain would'st put Upon poor love, to laugh him stil to scorn: But do not jest too far, Love is no Boy, Beleeve me, Friend, that will be jested with. Amynt. Niso, thou do'st me wrong, I'm no such man; Or if I be, 'tis thou led'st me the way. Niso. Who I? no, no, whilst we lay wounded both, Nor Nymph, nor Shepheard came to visit us, In whose discourse I found not something still That did not point at thy neglect of love, They told me that thou never mention'dst him Without contempt and scorn, that in disdain Of his great power, as Trophies of thy pride; When other Shepheards in the long liv'd Oak, Or in the tender bark of some young sprout Had grav'd the marks of their eternal flame, Thou there wouldst carve thy name, inlaced with Th' inhumane title which proclaims the still To be Amyntas the young Hunter, and to Love An Enemy profest. And wilt thou now Profess thy self a Lover? Amynt. This did I never do; but say I did, Am I the first of Loves professed foes Whom he hath overcome? Niso. I would thou wert, so I might see thee once By Love in triumph brought into the troops Of his sworn servants; then perhaps I might With confidence unfold the wound that now Lyes hid within, and grates my bleeding heart, Whereas I yet dare scarce let go a sigh, Lest thou shouldst once take notice when it breaths. Woes me, how many have I forced back, Even from my lips into my heart again! And if at unawares one hath stoln out, How have I fear'd lest while thou shouldst deride My feeling passion, Love should in his rage Let fly his Dart at me, for having spent His treasures so profusely before those Who do despise his power. Amynt. Niso, thou art deceiv'd; for even I Can pitty others sighs, O that I could As soon give ease to him that sighs for love! Perhaps I might a Shepheard then restore To life again, who now lyes at deaths door. But thou that long hast learn't to know Loves wiles, Hear but his case, and tell me then if yet In all Loves kingdom there may be found out A means to cure his ill. Niso. I in loves Kingdom nothing know, but how With art to drop Salt tears upon the flame That burns within my heart. To weep and burn is all I know of love: But is that Shepherd one whom I have seen? Amyn. Yes, thou hast seen him, and dost love him too, As dearly as thy life. Niso. What's she for whom he mourns? Amyn. The fairest Nimph that ere these fruitful fields Of Scyros here, have yet beheld display The dangling Tresses of her golden Hair, That every gentle blast might therein weave A net to catch poor loving souls withal: But more of her anone. Thou first shalt hear The mournful story of her dying love: Mournful indeed it is, and yet but short, Since one short hour, brought him to misery: Yet even he did once profess himself Loves open enemy, till at the last, His fate would have it so that by mis-chance He too was wounded in his Nimphs defence: Niso. But for what cause? Amyn. That thou shalt know hereafter; now observe The Nimph thus far took pitty of his hurt That many a time and oft, she bath'd his wounds In the distilled flouds of lukewarm tears, And sweetly breathing on them with her sighs She seem'd to murmur out some powerful charme, With which she hop't to mitigate his pain, But whilst his tender hearted Surgeon thus Applyed her salves of pitty to his wounds She struck him to the heart, when he poor soul, Finding he had receiv'd a mortal blow, Su'd for relief, but in an instance she Turn'd all her pitty into cruelty, And flying thence, as from a Basilisque, Could never since be drawn to see him more. Niso. Oh my belov'd Amyntas, I must needs Hug thee within these Armes, and kiss thee for This pretty quaint disguise. Amynt. Canst thou imagine then who 'tis I mean? Niso. And canst thou think, I can be ignorant Of him thou wouldst decipher, though his name Be lock't up still in silence? Amyn. Do thou pronounce it then, for I confess I blush so for him, that I dare not do't. Niso. I will, and (if thou do'st desire it) in a voyce That's audible to all the world. 'Tis Niso, Niso, do not blush for me, For I shall bless my fates that it is so. Go thou that livest free from loves command, And from his amorous bonds, lift up thy proud Untamed Crest, to me this yoke is sweet, And Niso doth profess himself to be The Shepheard thus subdu'd to loves behest. She that with pitty wounded him at first, And kills him now with cruelty, is cal'd, The fairest Celia, for Celia, alas For Celia I burn, for her I sigh It cannot be deny'd. Amyn. Though sigh for Celia? sure it cannot be, Nor can I yet beleeve it can be so; It is another fuel feeds thy flame, And all thy sighs sound out another name. Niso. Wilt thou not then beleeve me? or is this A gentle Artifice for my new love To tax my fault, blame mine inconstancie? If I have other fuel to my fire, Or other heat to warme my fainting soul That fuel is to Ashes burnt by this. And all that heat extinguisht by this flame. If any other name sound in my sighes, 'Tis barely then a name, a shaddow void Of any subject, or a beauty spent And long agone extinct, But now for Celia in lively flames I burn indeed, and so shall burning die, Unless Amyntas help me speedily. Amyn. See, see, alas, he seeks to me for help That gives me my deaths wound: But I cannot beleeve thee yet; say how, And when did Love possess thee thus? Niso. Whilst wounded there I lay, almost extinct, Within the arms of death, the gentle gale Of her sweet breathing sighs, under th' aspect Of two heart-killing Stars (O fatal birth!) My love at first took life, And Love becoming thus the Son of Death, In imitation of his Mothers power, Kils me, and yet remains himself alive. And thus I dye, yet even after death My love must live, and love eternally. Amynt. Thus Love hath in one strait, and by one toyl Within in one instant gain'd a double spoyl. Niso. As well then as thou feignest, thou do'st know That under other shaddows thou hast now From point to point declar'd my malady: Nor can I tell how long my silence should Thus blazon forth my wo. Unless perhaps I told it in a dream, Or talking idly at the point of death, The Soul which then doth commonly reflect More truly on her self, and so becomes Far wiser than she was, hath publisht it Of purpose, so to free her self from pain. Or else, perhaps, to glory in the pride Of that fierce cruelty that vanquisht me, Fair Celia her self hath made it known. Wilt thou not answer me, Amyntas, is't not so? Amyntas, whither art thou gone out of thy self? Thou seemest stupify'd, do'st thou not hear? What strong imagination thus transports Thy sences from their sence? Amynt. Doth Niso burn in love for Celia? And is it true that he dissembles not? But tell me then, what if another should For love of Celia burn as well as he? What saith thy heart, could it then leave to love? Niso. No, rather leave to live; ah me! Thou strick'st my through, and through, if this be so There is no way but death. Amynt. No, I'll dye first my self; clear up thy brow, I spoke it but in jest. Niso. I prithee good Amyntas leave to use Such bitter jests as these, they come too near: I'll pardon thee this once, because thou hast So little sense of Love. Amynt. What now is in my power shall be employ'd To work thee some relief; but time goes on, The Sun already from our Zenith bends His course, to view the lowly Vales again, And near the Temple old Narete staies Attending, there to celebrate the pomp, And solemn ceremonies of our Vow. Come let's away, perhaps already he Blames us for this delay. Niso. Go on, I'll follow thee: But if thou do'st Desire indeed here to prolong my daies, Defer not then a speedy remedy. He that already hath shakt hands with death, Hath little time to draw an idle broath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Scen. 1. Oronte, Perindo, Sireno, Ormino. Oront. Let all the rest stay there: And thou Perindo follow me, and see Those two old Shepheards come along with thee. Siren. Quickly Ormino come, do'st thou not hear? Orm. Where fear of danger wounds a trembling soul The foot goes slowly on. Perin. Great Sir, we all are ready, but will you Without attendance, or without your Guard Thus wander here alone? Oronte. In such sweet fields, amidst a sort of men So harmless as these are, we have no need With armed Squadrons to secure our Guard. I left my Tents that here I might enjoy The fresh delightful air, which in these fields Breaths with a gentle gale, and so allayes The horrour of the rough tempestuous blasts Which did infest the Sea And he that will enjoy the pleasure of Such pleasant fields must not be troubled with The State and Pomp with which we use to grace Our City Train. O blessed Meddow! O delightful Grove! See with what pleasing shadows it doth shield The flowers from withering in the scorching heat Of the Suns burning beams. Behold a true, A perfect Pastoral Scene, wherein we see The Sea on this hand, and the Hills on that; And round about us, Flowers, and springing Plants, Fresh Rivers, Shades, and the bright Heavens above Have fram'd a glorious Theater. Come forward friends, and whil'st the gentle Ayr Thus sweetly breaths, I will pursue at length The sad relation of your Childrens Fate. Orm. For pitties sake, great Sir, tell me, doth yet My Thirsis live? tell me but that, and then The rest tell at your leisure. Oron. Give ear I say; When I within the spacious Hall had plac't Those Troops of little Infants, so to be Presented there to the grand Signiors view, As if the World had then grown young again: Whilst he beheld them all attentively, And view'd them severally one by one; Amongst the rest who seem'd more rudely bred, Saucie and bold: Your children gave themselves With such a comely wantonness to play The little momes, and with such activeness, To beautifie their harmless innocence; That his great spirit mollifide therewith, Seem'd with a smile somwhat to qualifie The terrour of his more severe aspect; And reaching forth his hand (that hand which us'd Onely to manage Scepters, and rude Arms) Gently he stroakt them underneath the chin: And though he kist them not, yet men might see Upon his lips th' affection of his heart, And that to me he said, Mark me Oronte, Me-thinks I see in these two little Imps The signs of two such admirable souls, As that it seems (if in the outward shape Of humane visage, heaven use to write The marks of Fate, or I ought understand) (And more than he doth no man understand) That these two children are by destiny Design'd to more than ordinary ends, And to some great atchivements; therefore see They be not with the rest conducted to The Grand Serraglo; but be it thy care To see them Educated by themselves; And here in Court, instructed in more free, And generous Arts, and taught to spend their time In studies, fitter for their Genius. I undertook the charge, and they became So dear to me, as though I never saw, Child of mine own, nor had the joy to know A fathers happiness, yet did I feel, My heart possessed with a fathers care. And fraught with as much love to your young babes As they had been mine own. And whilst your children thus encreast in years, Above their years in them did still increase Beauty and judgement: but beyond all this, Ile tell you now a wonder: That quaint boy The little God of love, as it should seem, And as I verily beleeve it true, Playing with them as children use to play: By chance did hurt them both, and with his darts. Made large wide wounds, in their small tender hearts, Oh what a dear delight it was to see, Two little pretty loving souls express, Their pretty childish loves, with tongues which yet Could hardly mutter either Pap or Mam, For scarcely could they draw their vital breath, Before they both had learned to breath out Deep sighes of love: and scarcely were their eyes, Open to see the Suns bright shining beams, Before they knew with sweet delight to gaze And dart forth amorous looks. Sometimes you might behold those tender hands, Which scarcely yet knew how to smooth the Tears Of their beloved Nurse, already grown, So pompt and nimble in loves gentle art; As they had Learnt to strooke each others cheekes And frame unto themselves Rings quaintly wreath'd Within their curled Locks. And if at any time that native grace Which deck't their lovely faces did appear, More beautiful then other, they would then As if it were by stealth run to embrace, And hug each other with delightful kisses: So that whilst they thus wantonly did woe, Love seem'd himself to play the wanton too. And hence the King enamoured with their wiles, One day cal'd to me, and bespake me thus: So ripe a love as this cannot be held The meer effect of such young tender years. It must proceed from Heaven, and Heavens power Doth never work in vain: It is decreed. These two must one day be made man and wife And I am pleas'd with what the Heavens will. But ah the Heavens are too far esloign'd, Above our reach, nor can our humane sence. Attain to see what is decreed above: For long it was not, ere a sickness seas'd The bold grand Signor, and possest him so, As he already thought his fatal hour Approaching neer, already he dispos'd Himself to take his last farewel on Earth. And yet among his greater cares, and when His heart was thus encumbred with thoughts: He could not then forget to think upon His two beloved lovers, whom he caus'd, To be conducted to his Royal view, And placed there, where he thus unto them spake. My little children, I must shortly pay The debt I owe to nature, nor shall I, Live here to see you both enjoyn'd in one. I am too old, and you of too young years, Yet I will see you both betroth'd; this knot Doth neither pass your judgement, nor your age. Reach each your hand to other, and let Heaven Prosper the plighting of so pure a faith, Confirm'd with hands of so much innocence: Thus they t'wixt joy and grief, joyn'd both their hands And weeping seal'd their promise with a kiss. Whilst that great King drew forth a Hoop of Gold. Which underneath his Pillow, he had plac't. In whose round Circle were engrav'd by art Certain Egyptian Characters, and to confirm What there was writ, with more authority: His Sacred Image, was cut out thereon: The Hoop was double, so that either part When it divided was, made one entire And perfect circle, but the Charracters Were then defac't, and cut off in the midst. Whose half on this part was, and half on that. The King devided them, and then begirt With either parts the naked tender necks Of his two spoused Imps: And to them said This one day shall be witnesse of your Love And of the favour which I bear you both. Which said he turn'd his face as it appeares Or to restrain, or to conceal his tears, And I remov'd your children streight from thence And with such goods as then most precious were Conveigh'd them to my Castle, as afraid, (Oh fond and foolish humane providence!) Of those foul broyls and rapines, which are wont Most commonly to wait upon our funerals, At such great Princes falls. In this mean space a false alarum spread As false a rumour that the King was dead: And those that wish't it did beleeve it true. 'Mongst whom the King of Smyrna past for one, Who thus emboldened on a suddain flew, Upon the Thracian confines, and advanc't His armes so far, till at the last he came Unto that Castle and begirt it round By night, took, sackt, and burnt it to the ground. Orm. And were our children there, (Ay-me consum'd) In that so fatal flame? Oron. One of my servants whom the darksome shade Of gloomy night befriended to escape The enemies fierce hand, assur'd me that One of the Smyrna souldiers snatch't them both Alive out of the flames. Orm. And live they prisoners then in Smyrna still? Oron. I fear it much. For mark, The news of all this barbarous excess Arrived soon at Court, when yet the King Had onely so much sence and livelyhood As serv'd to hear it told: He heard the wrong And injuries he suffer'd, and his heart Inflam'd therewith. Just anger did so warm His frozen blood, as that it soon recal'd His flitting soul, that it might once more prove, A trusty Minister to execute, His just revenging wrath: But his faint enemy when once he heard That he yet lived, the rumour of whose death Had onely given courage to his fears. Betook him quickly to a shameful flight, And to appease the Kings just anger first, And next, that with more ease he might escape. Unto Bisantium, he sent the spoyls; And all the prisoners he had. Orm. And our poor children too? Oront. Those onely wanted, those were onely they Were missing whom alone the King desired, And for this cause, a far more mortal war, And a more deadly hatred he proclaim'd Against the King of Smyrna, if ere long Untouch't uncharm'd; he did not send him back Those pretty slaves, whom he alone did lack. The one denies to have them in his power, The other will by no means give belief To such a lean excuse: but needs will have His children or a most severe revenge: Thus both sides vow themselves to Armes again. And by the fierceness of a cruel War, The fruitful fields of Smyrna are layd wast And buryed in destruction, so that now, Smal hope remains that ever we shall see Your children more whom we have thus in vain Laboured to finde under the ruines of That poor decaying Kingdom. Orm. O most unhappy children! Sir. But parents more unhappy far then they. Oront. Unhappy children, and unhappy Sires. But yet in this more happy then the rest, That their unhappiness hath been bewail'd With floods of tears sent from his sacred eyes, And blood of thousand shed in their revenge. Orm. Unhapy tears, unhappy blood so shed, Unable to restore life to the dead. Per. These poor old Shepherds weep, and at their plaint, Oronte seems a little troubled. 'Twere not amiss then to divert them: Sir, The Sun already mounts the highest track, Of his most glorious Sphere, that to the West He may descend with a more swift carreer, And yet (as you know well) no choise is made Of such young Infants as we come to finde. No Trumpet yet accustomed to proclaim Your safe arrival here, hath summon'd them To meet you in the Temple. Oront. Let us return then to our Tents, and you Sad Shepherds lead us to some shady path, Towards the Sea, and let this comfort you. Dead or alive, where ere your children be, In Heaven or Earth, they needs must win the love Of men below, or of the gods above. Sir. Kind, gentle, Sir, The gods above vouchsafe To you that comfort which cannot be found, For us on this uncomfortable ground. Scen. 2. Serpilla. Celia. Serp. VVhat ho! Celia. Celia. Woes me, speak softly. Serp. Why what i'st that thou fear'st? Celia. Do'st thou not see my Father there? Serp. Hee's going hence, and cannot hear us speak, But thou in vain do'st hide thy self from me: Those very sighs which now thou breathest sorth. Into the ayre, (whilst yet thou do'st beleeve That nothing in these Woods can hear thy plaints, But Heaven it self) have told me thy distress. And courage Wench, 'tis a disease of love, Which is not mortal, 'tis a pleasing ill, Which generates encrease, but doth not kill. But whereon do'st thou look, turn, turn again, Thy face this way, alas poor silly soul Thy blushing cheeks speak what thy tongue for shame Dares not profess; and in that language which Nature permits them, tells me that their part, Lies in the flame which doth consume thy heart. If thou do'st love, then why do'st thou for shame Conceal thy love? Why do'st thou keep it clos'd Within thy brest? and bear a rugged brow: A fair smooth cheek, is a rich Theatre On which true love ascending from the heart. Glories to such his power. Even I my self once lov'd Ergasto well, And thy fair Mother lov'd Ormino too: Yet neither of us both are now asham'd That still the valleys eccho out our loves. Ãgeria, burns in young Armillo's flame. Urinda loves Licandor, and thy dear Beloved Cloris: that fair lovely Maid. Cloris that once profest her self to love So great a stranger; if thou know'st it not, Lives onely now, and onely sucks in ayre, To breath it out in sighs of sad despare. And though from thee she doth conceal her flame, Because she thinks thee so insensible, Of loves kinde heat, yet unto me she tells Her amorous thoughts: And whilst I with disdain, Reproov'd her once for too much cruelty In living without love she sadly said, Oh no, Serpilla no, poor Cloris lives Without a lover, but not without love. I love a Shepherd in another world. And such an one as though for ought I know, He now lies buryed in an earthen Urn. Yet I resolve the ashes of his bones, Shall be the onely fuel to my flame, Oh happy maid whom fate hath so far blest To burn in one love, and no more: Celia. Oh me most wretched then! Serp. What doth afflict thee, is the falshood of Thy faithless lover cause of this despair? Celia. Oh peace Serpilla, peace, press me no more To tell the horror of my deadly sore. Serp. Wilt thou not apprehend me then? The world goes so (dear Daughter) that thou see'st, Young tender loves breeding in youthful hearts, Like to young harmless Doves, whilst one hath wings And dares to fly; anothers downy plain: But even then buds forth: Whilst one swoln up with pride, bears out his Brest, And in a murmuring tone, breaths out his love Expressing by the circles which he makes, The endless Labyrinths of loves great maze. Another with his belly on the ground Goes creeping on, and by his whining noyse Sets out the passions of a childish love; One peeps but even now out of the shell, Whilst others sit to hatch their tender Chicks. Do not then, do not cruel maid conceal Thy passion still, though late, yet at the last Heaven showrs down vengeance on a faithless love: Knowst thou not what Pelorus, that Pelore, Then whom yet never Nimph in Scyros knew A faithfuller true lover; us'd to say? Faith is a Deity by which true love At first possest a place in Heaven above. Love voyd of faith (quoth he) is neither love Nor yet a God, but an infernal spirit Which having in the foul sulphureous Lake Of burning Phlegeton, kindled black flames, Doth counterfeit therewith loves glorious light, And so goes breathing forth his feigned fries: For whose most horrible and wicked sin, (Oh just and most deserved punishment!) Which in the bottomless infernal Pit, Disloyal lovers are tormented still By those infernal Monsters in the shape, Of their betrayed loves. Do not then still delay to tell thy woe, And if from grief I cannot set thee free, Pitty at least shall bear thee company. Celia. What's that to me, that neither hope for help Nor wish for pitty in my misery. Serp. At least, yet let me know thine enemie, And I will never leave thee till he leave, Either his life, or else that faithless love Wherewith he thus torments thee. Celia. Life if thou wilt, but love must ne'r be left. Serp. Would'st thou then have him dye. Celia. By all means possible, and if I find, No other hand to execute my just And lawful vengeance, reason then perswades, That mine own hand should take the due revenge Of mine oppressed soul. Serp. Oh cruel jealousie, can then thy fierce And poysonous bait possess a Maidens heart: (But if I mean to mollifie her rage, I then must sooth her in her own desires.) Take courage Celia, for if there be need Even I my self will with these hands pull out That faithless heart of his: But tell me then, Who is that false disloyal man, and how Hath he disturbed thus thy quiet thoughts? Celia. Now that I finde thee bent to my desires, Ile tell thee all, but see thou doe not change. Serp. Thou sooner shalt observe me change my soul, Then any thing that I have now profest. Celia. And whosoe'r it be, see that thou take No pitty to thy heart. Serp. I would be cruel to my very self, Were I my selfe unfaithfull to my Love. Celia. Heare then, and I will tel thee now, What rests conceal'd from all the world besides How shall I find a tongue to utter it But yet it bootes not to refrain my tongue When I want power still to restrain my heart: Look here Serpilla, look, here is that foul That impious wretch, even here within me rests My horrid enemy, Loe, I am she Even I am she that carry in my brest A faithless love, a foul infernal spirit. Burnt in a two-fold flame. Ser. As sure as can be, this unhappy Nimph Carries two youthful loves within her brest 'Twas long ere she conceiv'd, and now brings Twins. Oh just revenge of love, and could he not Make one shaft serve as able to subdue Unto his Laws thy stiff rebllious heart? But tell me then who are those fatal loves? Celia. To what end should I now conceal their names? Know'st thou not Niso, and Amyntas yet. Serp. Who they that lay for thy delivery, Wounded almost to death? Celia. Those very men. Serp. But how could love inflict a double wound, Just in an instant, in thy stubborn heart? Celia. Ile tell thee now a wounder. Love that before had ever found me arm'd, Against his shafts and all his subtile trains By others wounds, and through anothers heart, Found passage into mine. And whilst that they, Wounded to death lay breathing forth their souls, Love all besmeared with their goary blood, Usurpt the shape of pitty, and then arm'd Under this quaint disguise, the traiterous boy Found means to wound my heart: and after that Neglecting both mine Arrows, and my Bow, Despising, Earth, the Sea, and Heaven it self, I found no rest to my tormented soul, Longer then I stood languishing, besides Those wounded Shepherds, and with weeping eyes Mixing my plaints with theirs. There from their fainting foreheads, I did wipe, The cold distilled sweat, there with these hands Did I still dress their wounds, Oh cruel wounds That whilst I drest them, could thus wound my soul, Yet had I then some Truce with sorrow, when I said within my self unhappy Maid, What new found sighs are these, whence can proceed This unaccustomed heat which boyleth thus In thine inflamed heart? Ah silly fool (Said then my heart to me) this is nought elese But pitty; well deserved pitty: canst thou be So ignorant, as not to know it then? Or dost thou grudg them pitty, who to save Thee from a fearful death, lye dying now? Thus whilst I thought it pitty, and not love Flatring my passion, I still nourisht it, And still encreased my unknown desire, But when I after came to know it well, (Oh too too late discovery) when once, I found them lovers, then too late I found I was my self a woful lover too: And by the light of their bright burning flame. I saw mine own heart burning in the same. Serp. And art thou then with equal love belov'd? By both of them again, this may abate The wounding sorrows of thy troubled soul, But how did'st thou discover their desires? Celia. By many, many, tokens, for me thought I heard within my self a murmuring sound Which eccho'd out their love, and then my heart Answer'd that sound again, and yet deceipt I know not how, did so obscure my sence As I could not at first beleeve it true, Till one day it fell out, that whilst the poor Amyntas lying in tormenting pain, Which day and night afflicted him so sore, That he could hardly finde an hour to rest, Pitty so wrought, as I obtained Truce, Sometime with sorrow, that I might invite With the soft accents of my slender voice His heavy eyes to sleep. When he with a sad sigh sent from his heart, Darted a look at me, and to me said, Ah my dear Celia, when I see thee not I am but as one dead, and canst thou think? That when I see thee then, 'tis possible For me to sleep, before those glorious beams Which shine out of thine eyes? I thus surpris'd, Straight fled feom him, and ran unto the place Where wounded Niso lay, opprest with pain, And calling for mine ayd. Where whilst I gently did unbinde his wound, A stream of blood, I know not how gusht forth. And stain'd my naked breast; which seen he said Oh Celia, do not disdain the blood Which by instinct of Nature flies to thee, Thou art my heart, and when man dies 'tis known That to his heart his blood descendeth down: Thus in an instant both their loving souls Lay open to my view, and I who then Scarce knew that I did live, felt in my heart (Which yet could not be angry at their love) Those Maiden thoughts, which labour'd to awake That usual disdain, which Maidens use Against loves first assault: but then, alas, I could not use it, but instead thereof, Found that in spite of me those amorous plaints Made in my soul an amorous eccho sound: Yet did I fly with speed, but all too late, For all the speed that I could seem to make, I then fled from them, and will never see Again my hearts desir'd felicity: But though I fly them, 'tis impossible To fly from love, who traces still my steps By the cold drops of my distilling tears, Even through most darksome shades, whereof I hide My self from all besides, and sure I think He knows me by my voice, and groaning sighs: But to shun love, I yet can fly to death, Why then Serpilla dost thou still delay To ease me of this sad tormenting grief? As ever thou didst pitty one distrest, Pluck thou this faithless heart out of my brest. Serp. Poor miserable Maid, ah Celia! My dearest Celia, dry up those tears. Take comfort my sweet heart. although thy wound Put thee to pain, it may be cur'd again: Art thou asham'd that double love infests Thy wounded soul? Love thou but one alone, And let thy future faith take vengeance so Of all thy former infidellity. Celia. Thy counsels vain Serpilla, for my wound Is every way incureable, shall I, Love onely one, and which, Ahme! and which Shall I then leave to love? Serp. Love him of both, who best deserv's thy love. Desert in love, hath an attractive power. Celia. But I cannot descern a difference: For in mine eyes their merits which exceed All othes mens, seem equal in themselves. Serp. Love him then whom thou first didst love thy self: Time gives the priviledge to elder love. Celia. Both at a time, and in one instant both My twin-like loves were born, and gathered strength. Serp. Love him alone then, who best loveth thee, For love must ever give the Law to love. Celia. With equal freedom I have seen them both For me shed tears, and breath heart wounding sighs Yea both for me have spent their dearest blood. Serp. And yet it cannot be but that sometimes Thy amorous thoughts like waves tost to and fro, Must needs bend this way, rather than to that, Pursue then him that conquers, love him best To whom thy heart seems oftest to encline. Celia. In vain, I tell thee, still in vain thou tryest To alter what the heavens have decreed. 'Tis true indeed that whilst I seem to stray Out of my self, amidst my troubled thoughts Me-thinks by stealth, Amyntas, or perhaps Niso perswades me wholly to himself: But scarce then can I say, Love I am thine, When suddenly the other shews himself All torn and wounded in my just defence, And forceth me to pitty his distresse. Thus in perpetual Wars the victory Still flies from one to other, and remains So small a while with either, as I doubt, And know not unto whom to give the Crown, But leave them both far short of their desart, A poor reward, the conquest of my heart. Serp. I am convinc'd, and therefore must give way. What can be urged more? If needs thou must Be still unfaithfull, yet high heaven hath For thy discharge made infidelity It self seem innocent; nor can I find Another refuge, thou canst fly unto, Since thou mayst not love one still love them both. And let this be thy comfort, thou mayst find Within these fertile fields, others that feed More than one sucking Infant at their breasts: And see where Nerea comes just in the nick: She that whilst any would beleeve her vows Had both her hands full, and her lap of loves: And with her comes Amyntas. Celia. Or stay, or follow me, for I must go Like to the Bird of night, which still doth shun The gladsom rayes of the bright shining Sun. Serp. Turn, turn again my Celia, hark a word. But she nor turns, nor hearkens what I say, And therefore I will follow her. Scen. 3. NEREA. AMINTAS. Ner. And wouldst thou then that I should speak of love To Celia, and that for Niso too? A hard employment to perswade a heart Estrang'd from love, to love a stranger streight. Amynt. O gentle Nerea, full well I know No enterprize in Love can seem too hard For thee to undertake, who canst dispose Of Loves great Empire as it pleaseth thee. Ner. Courteous Amyntas, time once was, 'tis true, I could doe much, when in these lips I bore Vermilian Roses, and in these curl'd locks A golden treasure; but when beauty fades All force of love decaies. Amynt. What then thy beauty for thy self could do Thy wit can now procure for others too, Amongst those locks where gold then glittering shon, Love hath sowen judgements now, and on those lips Where formerly Vermilan Roses grew He hath plac'd honey, and the pleasing sound Of sweet perswasive words, for where thou goest, The most ingenuous Bee brings to the hive The honey sweets of love. Ner. O true, but yet unpleasing Simile, I am the Bee, which now to others bring That honey which my self must never tast. Such is the will of love, great love, who frees No age from love, but hath decreed that those Who in their younger yeares themselves did love Shall in their age be others instruments, To win their loves, that so all Ages may, And all men living serve his powerfull will, Either as tinder to endure his fire, Or steeles which send out sparkles to raise that fire, Either as burning flames of love to all, Or bellows to encrease those flames withall. O what soft, delicate, and tender things In things of love, did Nature shoure on me! In fine, I never brook'd, nor ever shall To be entreated in a case of love, And to deny my help. Behold me then Amyntas ready prest To do whatever thou canst ask of me. But yet (my Son) how much more willingly Should I receive those prayers which now thou mak'st To me for others, were they for thy self. Fond youth (I needs must call thee so, Though I am sure I speak but to the air) How canst thou without shame, without disdain And just displeasure 'gainst thy self behold A new come stranger, one who scarce arriv'd E'r yesterday within our native soyl, And one that never looked since he came But with his eyes still rowling in the dark And gloomy shades of his approaching death? Who yet could know how with delight to gaze Upon that beauty, and desire it too. Which thou, who first were born here, and bred up Still in her sight, wouldst never look upon. Amynt. O Nerea I am not blind. Ner. But at the least thou'rt purblind, so is he, And lookes on all a squint that can behold So rich a beauty, and yet knows not how Or which way to conveigh it to his heart. For thee, Amyntas, O against thy will, Happy Amyntas, yea for thee alone, And yet thou know'st it not, do'st not care for't, For thee the heavens sent fair Celia, Do'st not beleeve me? look on her fair eyes, Look on thine own, love gave them to you both, That both of you might still admire and gaze Upon your native beauties. Those her fair curled locks, these crisped hairs. Seem onely fram'd that each of you might tye Each others soul in them eternally. Her fair plump rising cheecks, thy downy chin, Were made that each on other might repose, After the stormy blasts of loves sad woes, Her rosie mouth, and thy Vermillion lips, Invite you both with mouth to mouth to taste Those purple Strawberries which there are plac't: Seest thou not how in her white bosom rests, Those tender swelling, and well raised brests, Which challenge thee into the lists of love. And thou like a Coward dost refuse To answer to their call? discurteous youth Canst thou invited thus, refuse to try Their loving force? and so in love withstand, Eternal Fate which all things can command. Amyn. Ah me most miserable! Nerea. What's that thou saiest? Amyn. Nothing: Ah me! I scarce can breath a sigh. Nerea. And dost thou sigh? alas wherefore? Thy heart devoyd of love, deceiv'd perhaps, Borrows those sighs, that sighing thou maist seem To be in love, why do I call them sighs? Thine are no sighs: he that sighs not for love, Sighs not but Yawns, such sighs no love can move. Amyn. But if those sighs be too too truly sighs, Which issue from the bottom of my heart, And such as I need seek no other where, They then perhaps break out onely to shew The secret grief enclos'd within my breast; O Nerea, Nerea! Perhaps the very rocks perceive ere this That heart which thou deceived thus dost call A heart devided? of Love, so set on fire And burning in the lively flames it feels, As without other help, it may find out Cause in it self to spend these sighs about. Nerea. Behold a new Amyntas lately come Out of the bosom of his Silvia, And from beyond th' Arcadian Hills ariv'd. Newly in Scyros here, How feelingly he can discourse of love. A breast, a heart, love, flames, and burning fire: Sighs and Ah me's, all these are proper words Taken from loves best language, and thus all True lovers speak which are Inhabitants Of loves great Empire: But when wer't thou there? Or where Amyntas didst thou learn so well To speak their mother Tongue? Amyn. Even in the very Center of that blest And happy Kingdom, where loves Septer rules, There have I been, and so that country ayre. Pleaseth my sense, as though it seems to me, Still turbulent and cloudy, yet no other skye Can ever be more welcome to my eye. Nerea. Thou speak'st in such a tone Amyntas, and so well Dost mix thy sighs together with thy words, And make sad looks accompany thy sighs, As I could almost swear thou wert in love. Amyn. True love cannot be feign'd: 'tis true that once I fled from love, but since he overtook Me in my flight, I follow him as fast. Nerea. Oh admirable power against whose will Nor flight nor pollicy can ought avail. Now blest be lov'd, great love that thus can give Unto thy stony heart a lively sence: But wilt thou not then tell me who she is Whom love hath chosen for a worthy means To do so great a work? Amyn. No I have told too much already, but The tears which spring out of my heart, do cause My tongue to glide so fast: and now 'tis time To teach it silence. Nerea. Silence to me? well then be silent still. But yet if I be she, which can dispose Of loves great Empire, as it pleaseth me; Perhaps one day thou wilt entreat me hear The story of thy love, and lend thee help, When I will be as deaf unto thy prayers, As thou art silent to me now. Amyn. Good Nerea, let us talk of somewhat else, Let us discourse of Niso, and for him Employ thy care, for as for me, I yet, Nor seek, nor hope, nor can desire thy help. Nerea. What a rude rustick lover have we here? If love be lodg'd in a rough savage heart, Poor love himself becomes a savage too, And so hath neither hope nor yet desire: But be it as thou wilt, for Niso then I will employ my cure, and if or will, Or Art, have any power to win a love In his content thou shalt learn first to see, And then repent thine error, when thou shalt See that cold Celia, that Mass of stone, By my endeavours, and but easie cure, All burning in loves flame, and in these fields. In these same very fields wherein she now, Like a unwearyed huntress beats the ground With her still erring foot, when thou shalt see Her in the Arms of lovely Niso. Print Upon these flowry banks more tender steps, And gentler signes, of a more pleasing choice: What then alas, what will become of thee? I know too well that then I shall thee see, Crying Oh help me Nerea, Oh help: But all in vain, for then I will not help, But laughing scorn thee for thy foolery. Amyn. And dost thou then Ah-me, with Celia hope: Dost thou with Celia hope to do so much. And that for Niso too? Nerea. Hope? Yes with Celia, or with any else, More out of love, with love then she can be, And that for Niso, or for any else, Unhappier in love then he can be. This I can do, and this I will doe too, Make Niso to enjoy his Celia. Amyn. Ah me! I'me dead. Nerea. And I will make her thine, who ere she be Whom thou desirest so, if thou wilt but Disclose thy love to me. Amyn. That Niso my enjoy his Celia, That's all I ask. Nerea. But wherefore dost thou then lament? in time Demand my help, and thou shalt have it. Amyn. Shall Niso then, Ah me, have Celia? Nerea. Hee's much perplext, and certainly this man Deceives me yet, and wisheth somewhat else, Then he seems to desire: Ile sound his thought Which very hardly can conceal it self: Thou troubled soul, what i'st that greeves thee now? Celia shall be for Niso, as thou dost desire. Though it be true, that with less pains I could Procure her for Amyntas, if Amyntas would As Niso doth, burn for fair Celias love. I know well what I say, but 'tis not fit I should so easily discover yet, The secret thoughts of a young virgin maid, To him that cannot apprehend them. Amyn. Dost hear me Nerea? tempt me no more, For Niso 'tis I speak, and 'tis for him That I would have thee speak. Nerea. He shakes already, and will quickly fall; Well I will do't, but if she shall be found To him inexorable, wilt thou then Permit me try what I can do for thee? All women are not cruel to all men? Amyn. She moves my very soul, nor can I tell How to withstand it: But poor Niso then, What will poor Niso say? Nerea. Amyntas did for me more then he would Do for himself, and therefore I rejoyce, His bliss can rise out of my misery, This will he say: But whereon dost thou think? Why dost thou scratch thy head, when all the itch Thou feel'st is in thy heart? Amyn. Mercy, Oh Mercy, I am overcome, And hear me Nerea: Yet peace, Peace tender lover, but unfaithful friend: But I were best be gone: Nerea adieu, Thou knowst what I desire: I speak for Niso, dost thou conceive me? Scen. 4. NEREA. Either I nothing understand in love, Or else Amyntas loves fair Celia: But wherefore speaks he then for Niso thus? It is perhaps a lovers folly that Under a feigned affection seeks to prove The faithful heart of his beloved love: Oh ill advised youth, how darst thou tempt A womans faith by forging new loves still? Darst thou trust fuel in a burning flame? Or feathers to the winde? full ill thou knowst, How many I have seen these tryals cause Soon to repent them of their former love; But it may be the pitty of a friend, Perhaps it may be so, and Niso doth, Himself too burn for love of Celia. And yet the simple soul Amyntas speaks Onely for him, and doth not know that love, Values no friend when once his force doth move: But be it as it will, I'me glad to see Them both sad frequent lovers yet, that so I may be double arm'd and with more force Give on a brave assault to that hard heart Of pittiless, but lovely Celia. For I will kindle in her Virgine brest, Both these hot flames, that one at legst may take: And pittifully paint before her eyes Them both for love of her, brought to deaths dore, And both from love, and from her father too. I mean to tell her that in her own hands The power of choice doth lye. Th'art but a fool my Celia, if thou starve For want of love, when to such lovers bring Such dishes to the feast: Oh that I could, But change, change fortunes with thee cruel Nimph. Change and take thou my hot inflamed brest, Or lend one thy soft golden glittering hair, White snowy locks, with an heart all on fire. Soft golden hairs, with an heard Iron heart, Are Monsters too too cruel, but Ile go And seek her out, sure I shall conquer her, For I ner'e knew a fair young maid deny, To love at last, if su'd to constantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Scen. 1. Celia. Oh Nerea, thou hast kil'd my woeful heart, And from thy lips death shot his fatal dart. Woes me, 'twas long ere I did burn, but now I am all fire, nor can there be Ah-me! A way to quench the fury of my flame, Love be my guide Amyntas! To thee my dear Amyntas, unto thee I do submit my self, I will be thine, And thou shalt be my love, my life, my all, Ah-me: what did I say? And can I then without my Niso live? No, No, but for Amyntas, I can dye And dow behold me given over quite Unto my wonted fury, Oh Celia! Unhappy Celia, still dost thou rave What dost thou think, and whether dost thou tend, In this estate, depriv'd of all my bliss. It cannot be I should continue long. Enjoy but one? Love will not give me leave To enjoy both, both Heaven and Earth forbid. Then I must dye, for other remedy Then death this death cannot invent. Must I then dye? But lately born and must I dye so soon? Sad mourning eyes, the time is short which fate, Allotted to you, to behold this Sun, And yet alas I have but seen too much. Fool that I am, what i'st I greeve for for thus? Loss of my life? and what can I expect To gain by living here? nought else but woe Nothing but grief: and doth it greeve thee then To part with grief? Oh no, let death, kinde death Come then, and with his hand close up mine eyes, And dry up all my tears: And yet alas, Those tears, nor all my sad despairs cannot Call out so loud for death in my poor soul, As others torments do, Oh Nerea, Nerea. For love of me then doth Amyntas burn? And Niso too? for me doth Niso dye? Yea and Amyntas too? and I who love you both. Unhappy lovers, is it I whom love Too cruel love hath set against you both? And is it I that kill you? then 'tis I, 'Tis I must dye, and fear not, I will dye, That so my death may either give you ease, Or else revenge your cruel suff'rings. Oh direful voice! And yet base Coward heart, Fear'st thou one death, that dost not fear two loves? No, no, vain pitty! pitty pittyless Base trembling fear, and you cold frozen thoughts, You can no longer lodge within this breast. Behold my hand full armed for the deed, Oh vile and cowardly hand! what trembling thus Dost thou discharge thy darts? Woes me, I want Force that will second this my just revenge: Let then my feet do what my hands deny, Oh my sad furies! Oh despairing grief! Be you my faithful guide, lead on, lead on, Shew me another way to finde out death. Conduct me to a Precipice where I Shall need no force to press me to my fall: But if a bush, or any stub should stop My fatal fall? for so Amyntas was Sav'd when he would have dyed for Silvia: That would be my misfortune then, that was to him A happy blessing: What then shall I do? Oh you Celestial Gods! and you sad powers, That govern in the deep infernal Lake. You that inspir'd me with desire to dye, Shew one the way to do it speedily. Scen. 2. Filino. Celia. Felino. Oh me most miserable. Oh my dear pretious, and my lovely joy! Oh my lost treasure! Celia. What mournful voice thus sounds within mine ears? Is not this Filino? Filino. Oh Celia weep, weep gentle Celia, Do not so much as stay, till I have told What cause thou hast to weep. Celia. And to what new misfortune can the Gods, Preserve me yet in this smale hour of life. What can there be that can disturb me more? Speak quickly Filino, for well I know The grief which hath already seiz'd my heart Can leave no place for any new supply. Fil. Distressed Filino, unhappy Celia! Thy joy, and all my wonted bliss, The beauty of the Meades, flower of the fields, The love of all thy flock, thy gentle kid (O me! my heart will break to tell it out) Thy gentle Kid is dead. Cel. O happy boy, since all thy sorrows are Compriz'd within so poor a loss as this. But say who was't that kild him? Fil. Beleeve 'twas neither Shepheard nor wild beast: For I would then have dyed in his defence. Cel. What was it then? Fil. The noysom feeding of a poysonous hearb, Ah me, was the cause of all. Cel. What of a poysonous hearb? then this way sure The heavens have shew'd me now a means to dye. O all ye gracious Gods can it be true That any pitty to my lasting woes Should then ascend to heaven? Fil. The Kid ascend to heaven? what butting then Will there be seen 'twixt him and Capricorn? Cel. But let me yet beware lest the mistake Of a poor silly boy should bring my thoughts Of death into a by-word and a scorn. Tell me, my boy, how do'st thou know the Kid Dyed by a poysonous hearb? Fil. Ile tell thee. When the Suns hot burning beams About the mid time of the day gan rage, I led thy flocks unto those shady Meades Not far from hence, do'st thou not know them? those Which 'twixt the Rivers and the Woods are fraught With such fresh springing grass, and ever green, Where being once arriv'd, observe me Celia, And whilst the bellowing of the heards apply'd Unto the sound of my small Oaten-pipe, Seem'd to salute the fresh green pasture there, Thy pretty Kid, Ah my dear pretious joy! Thy pretty little Kid, all full of play, Running and Skipping, with such wanton frisks. Playd with the grass; in such a pleasing way As that, I do not say my self, no, no, But to say true, even all thy gentle flock Left off their feeding, and stood gazing on The pretty sport he made. Celia. Be brief, be brief, my Filino, I have no time To tattle now, tell quickly what I ask, Filino. Softly! give ear, Within the twinkling of an eye, he ran Quite cross the Meadow, till at the last he came Unto that little streaming Brook which runs, Next to the Hill, and there began to feed Upon an Hearb, which yet I never saw, Grow any other where, and there did graze, With such an Appetite, and eat so fast, As it did fatten me to see him taste, And relish it so well. But on a suddain, Oh sad heavy chance, I saw him trembling fall, and think you not, That in an Instant, I flew to him straight? I look't upon him, cal'd him, prest his Limbs: He look't on me again, and seem'd to moan His sad estate, and trembling seem'd to say, Ah Filino I dye. Thus did I see his eyes grow dark and dim, Those pretty eyes of his, I saw retire, Into his head, his eye-lids closed up. And thus alas I saw him dye: Celia. But yet I am not satisfied perhaps, He did but faint, and onely seem'd to dye: Perhaps it came too by some other means, Then by the hearb he fed on: Th'art a child, Poor Filino as yet, and little knowst What doth belong to cattle or their food. Filino. Well! but Nerete, that grave hoary Beard, That reverend peece of age, is he a child? And knows he nothing too, what doth belong To hearbs and beasts? Celia. What did Nerete say? Filino. He at my cryes came running in, and found Me standing by the Kid with weeping eyes, To whom when I related had the cause, Of all my moan, Oh wicked hearb, quoth he: Drive Felino, go drive thy flock from hence, Unto some other place: which said he straight Ran to the Kid, and drew him from the place Where then he lay, unto the Rivers side: But I had not the heart to see him thrown Into the water so: But wailing ran To find thee out. Celia. Nerete doth deserve to be beleev'd, The death then of my Kid is certain now, And so's the cause thereof, come Filino, Come lets away. Filino. And whether? Celia. To find out that same Hearb. Filino. And what to do? Celia. Let not that trouble thee. Filino. Ah! with what eyes shall ever I behold That Meade again? Celia. Come quickly Felino, what i'st thou dost? Filino. I look at Nerea, that's coming here? Ah let me stay a while, for she is wont, For every kiss I give her to bestow An Apple on me. Celia. Nerea? follow me quickly and take heed, Thou dost not anger me. Filino. I come, I come, see if she fly not hence, Like to an arrow from a Bow. Scen. 3. NISO. NEREA. Niso. Ah were but now Amyntas here That he might know the story of my death, And of her cruelty. Ner. He hath already heard, and griev'd to hear it. I met with him when Celia went from me, And told him all the sute that I had made To her, and how unkindly she refus'd To give an ear thereto, and him I left Close by the River, mourning like a friend For thy misfortune. Niso. Go on then, tell me, what didst thou reply? Ner. Ah cruel Nymph, said I then to her straight, And wilt thou not admit a loving soul Unhappy in his love, at least to tell The nature of his grief? Niso. And she? Ner. There's not a Shepheard, she made answer then, Whether a strange or a native born, There's not a Shepheard that dares be so bold As to importune Celia for her love, Each man flies from me, every man thats wise Locks up his words in silence, and if yet There be a man that suffers for my sake Let him relate his sorrows to the trees, And be assur'd that trees and plants will prove Less deaf than Celia, and more apt to love. Niso. O cruel and most savage heart! Ner. Tush this was nothing, her fierce angry looks Spake more than did her tongue; for all her speech Was full of such obscurity, as I Could hardly understand her what she meant; But then I saw her cheeks grow pale as death, Her ruby lips too lost their colour quite, I did not see her weep, but yet I saw Her eyes full fraught with grief, though free from tears. And then as if she had disdain'd her self, And such fond looks as those, she shakt her head, And suddainly her eyes grew red with rage, And shot out flames of anger, till at last I could perceive her in a threatning wise Brandish her dart; I know not well at whom. Niso. At me without all doubt, and I my self, Even I my self will straight present her with This naked breast, and with this hand tear up This wound again, which is but newly clos'd, That so her Shaft may find a shorter way, Yea and a wider passage to my heart: And since that cruel she denies to hear The story of my woes, she yet shall hear The sad relation of my fatal death: And so perhaps in that same point of time When her fair hand shall fling her dart at me, In that same happy point of time I may, At least before I dye, say that I dye. Ner. Unhappy Shepheard! ah! alass, those eyes, Those lovely eyes of thine must not alone Drop brinish tears, but even I must needs My self weep with thee too for company. But Niso, my sweet youth ('tis fit I should Give him some comfort) I will not deny But it is true that Celia shew'd her self Beyond all measure cruel, yet who knows But that she may for all this counterfeit? For my part Ile not swear she doth not so. The art of feigning is by nature taught To women, so said one, and she said true: For from their very birth they can conceal Their inward thoughts and though but children, yet Under a frowning brow they have the art In secret to conceal a loving heart. But be she as she will, who yet can say She may not change her mind? For women are Like to the Moon, and vary both their looks And shapes as well as she, if then they love, Yet trust them not, despair not though they hate, But give them time at least to change their thoughts. Do'st thou not see the heavens in a trice Both burn and freeze? It was but yesterday When thou beganst to love, and scarce hast yet Learnt to breath forth a sigh, 'tis not then time Already to despair; a short breath'd sigh Cannot through Loves vast ocean drive a soul Into the port of rest, and full content: Thou didst but now begin, and canst thou then Despair already to attain thy wish? Niso. 'Tis true, alass, my love but now begins, But yet my life's already at an end: For this confounding flame scarce kindled yet Already hath consum'd my heart. Ner. But yet take heart again, and live by hope: For be assur'd, no art that can be found To rouse up love where most he lyes asleep, Shall be left unattempted for thy sake. Let's search out all Loves engins then, and try The utmost of their forces one by one. Tell me then, didst thou never yet make known Thy love to her by any other means? Didst thou not yet so much as in thy looks. Or in thy sighs send to her frozen heart The first embassages of love? Niso. Yes! but what profit have I gain'd? When all my sighs breath'd through the empty air, Were by the wind disperst ere they could come Unto the breast to which I sent them forth? And Looks, the messengers which lovers send To them they love, are ever strucken dumb, When onely he that sends them looks in vain, And she to whom th'are sent looks not again. Ner. Didst thou say nothing to her when thou lay'st Wounded, and hadst her ever by the side? Niso. Ah me! would death had shackled up my tongue, Which love unhappily did then let loose: For then it was she fled away so fast As I could never see her since. Ner. And didst thou never since present her with Some amorous token, pretty loving gift? Niso. Gift? heaven defend, tempt Celia with gifts? To use a gentle Nymph as one would use A covetous base croan? I should beleeve With gifts to make a well bred heart become Sooner an enemy than yeeld to love. Ner. If thou beleeve so, thou beleev'st amiss. The heavens themselves are pleased with our gifts, And hell is pacify'd, nor canst thou think Women less covetous than heaven, nor yet Less cruel than the deep infernal pit, A gift, beleeve me, Niso, a rich gift Is the great instrument of love, or tyrant rather, Which doth command and rule love as it please. Knowst thou not what Elpino, wise Elpino said? That in the worlds first infancy when truth, And pure simplicity made heart and tongue Speak both one language: Nymphs that were in love Could sing no other song but dona, dona, Which in our later language sounds, give, give; And therefore since, with double N (because One gift will not suffice) a Woman is In the Italian tongue call'd Donna now. And if there be such wandring beggars stil, As think it no disgrace unto their kind To beg Love as an Alms: Then say not thou That none but covetous base women will Beg or receive a gift. Niso. Thou telst me wondrous things. Ner. But yet as clear as is the Sun, and know That man is covetous that in his love Spends, though by thousands, nothing else but sighs, And looks, and words, and prayers, and trickling tears. Yea though he joyn some little lyes to boot, And make no conscience to be perjur'd too, Let him but give a poor lean sucking lamb, And he shall give therewith a greater proof Of his true love then all the rest can bring: For women now adaies can onely trust A giving love, all else are but deceit, And 'tis but reason that his love who gives Should conquer all, their greatest cruelty, Since it hath conquer'd his base covetise, A monster far more cruel. Niso. Alass, if it be true then that a gift Contains that power in it to overcome Her yet untam'd, unconquer'd cruelty, This heart, this soul, this all, what e'r I am, Even all my self, I give unto her will. Ner. Alass, poor man, this is the gift which all Poor Lovers give their loves with open hands, A heart, a soul, are of too great a price, I would not for a world (my Son) no, no, I would not have thee be so prodigal; Keep them (love) for thy self, and let thy gift Be of less value, but yet more desir'd. Niso. I, a poor stranger in these parts, devoyd Of lands and flocks, from whence shall I obtain A gift that's worth the sending? here, Give her this dart, 'tis not to be despis'd; Mark both the pile and shaft. Ner. The pile is sharp and piercing, and the shaft Pithie and straight, fitted as they should be, To dart at savage beasts in the wild woods, But for fair Celia's hand (to speak the truth) For her soft tender hand it seems too big, And sure she cannot weild it. Niso. What thinkst thou of this horn? Ner. Oh! I of horns am a great Mistress too, And did present her one the other day; And with your patience be it spoke, perhaps Farier than that. Niso. Then now I have bethought me of a gift, May happily seem not unworthy of Fair Celia her self. Ner. Is it about thy neck? Niso. Is't not a fair one Nerea? see. Ner. What's this that shines so? take it off, that so I may the better view it. Niso. Have patience; so, 'tis now undone. Ner. Ah, what a pure white neck he hath! I scarce Could hold from kissing it. Niso. O sad remembrance of my former love, And of my by-past happiness: Go now, For heaven ordains thee to a better fate: Behold it Nerea. Ner. Ah! who did ever see a braver thing? It looks, as 'twere all gold. Niso. And 'tis all gold: But go and see if thou With it canst purchase me my life again: Defer no time, what do'st thou muse upon? Ner. Niso, to tell thee true, she went from me So troubled, and so full of high disdain As I have cause to fear she never will Give ear to me again; or if she doe That, yet I shall not have the power to win A favour from her, therefore it were fit Some other should present this gift to her. Niso. If Nerea thou forsake me, I am lost. Ner. Have patience, heaven it self is on our side: Seest thou that Nymph that yonder comes that way? If the bright glistering of her scattered hair With too much beauty dazle not mine eyes 'Tis Cloris, or 'tis rather she, because Mine eyes do dazle, and from thence I know 'Tis she indeed; for there is none that can Display such golden locks before the Sun. It must be Cloris, who alone is she That hath fair Celia's heart: Cloris it is, Than whom in Scyros Celia never knew A true friend: Oh happy thou if she Will but conveigh thy gift. Niso. But I am no way known to her, do thou Do thou speak for me, and entreat her help. Scen. 4. CLORIS. NISO. NEREA. He comes not yet, and I must here attend The old mans leisure. Niso. Why do'st thou stay? Ner. For loves sake peace. Clor. But what shall I do here alone the while? Sigh out my love? then let us turn again Unhappy love unto our wonted pains, And sighing still breath out my luckless wo Into this amorous air. Niso. Go yet at last, what do'st thou fear? Ner. She plaies the wilie wench, I know her well By many proofs: be stil a while. Clo. But where, alass, O where are you lost sighs? And whether do you wander through the air? If yet you know not where to find the heart To which love sends you erring messengers Of most unhappy news? Niso. Woes me! go on, and try her though my case Be ne'r so desperate; for whatsoe'r befall, I can but dye. Clo. Ah! shall I never live to see the day When once before I dye I may behold My beauteous Sun again? 'Tis but a look I beg, and then Ile dye, And dye concent; for one look and no more I would give up my life, and its worth that. Niso. Ah Nerea! Ner. Have patience, now I go. Clo. O heavens! Ner. The gracious heavens satisfie. Clo. Ah me! Ner. Thy just desires, my gentle Cloris? Clo. Thy unexpected voice made me afraid. Ner. But pitty then anothers just desires, Use thou that pitty which thou do'st implore Thy self from heaven. Clo. What should I say? I doubt she hath heard all: Thou seest me, Nerea, here all alone, Sighing for that blest day, when I shall once Behold again in heaven above that Sun Which I in Smyrna saw. But what do'st thou desire of me? what is't? Ner. The life of a poor Shepheard. Clo. Farewel, I'm gon: Thou knowst I never lend an ear to those That speak to me of Love. Ner. O spightful soul! do'st hear? fly not away. The thing whereof I speak, 'tis true, is love, But such as thou wilt not denie to hear, Beleev't it is, and by this hand I swear, This fair, this tender hand which now I grasp. Clo. Whats that? for loves sake give it me. Ner. Sh' hath snatcht it from my hand. Cloris look on't, Is't not a fair one? but thou shalt have time Hereafter to look on it long enough. Now hear what I would say. Clo. 'Tis none of mine, for thats about my neck. It must be that of Thirsis: O ye Gods! Whats this I see? Ner. Bear up my Niso, and resume again Thy late lost courage, see shee's pleas'd beyond All measure with thy gift, and she will bring Fair Celia to like it too If she but take in hand to give it her. See how she looks upon't. Niso. Follow it then, Nerea, O follow it. Thou onely canst revive my hope again. If yet my hope can ere revive again. Clo. But if my Thirsis should be dead and so The Ring be faln into some others hands: Who gave thee, Nerea, this golden ring? Ner. A gentle Shepheard gave it me. Clo. A Shepheard hereof Scyros? Ner. No, but a stranger born. Clo. And to what end then did he give it thee? Ner. He gave it as a token of his love, And his eternal faith. Clo. Of love to thee? Ner. To me? Look I like one whose love is to be bought With others gifts? O no I am too old: 'Tis not for me to sell my Merchandise, She that is rich in years must buy, not sell, If she intend to please her self in love. But thou dost know this, and dissemble it: His love is of a higher nature fram'd, Unhappy he loves a despairing hope, Saving that fortune in this hooped ring (But mark in what a narrow space) still moves And turns his fainting hopes to her he loves. Clo. I prithee ease my pain, and let me know What name that Shepheard bears, where he abides, Or let me see, or let me speak with him. Ner. 'Tis that which he desires, Niso stand forth: Behold the Shepheard here for whom I plead, It cannot be but he is known to thee, As one of those (whom if thou didst attend The solemn pomp which was this morning held In payment of his vow) thou needs must see Triumphing in the Temple. Niso. Yes I am he fair Nymph, who did triumph This morning, and this very night must dye, If love be not my help. Clo. Both name, and voice, and look all different, But yet what doth not time and fortune change? And still me-thinks he doth resemble him: But yet my heart goes faster than mine eyes, And therefore I am fearfull least desire, Too much desire should mock my fawning hopes. Say gentle Shepheard is this ring thine own? Niso. It is mine own, save onely in as much As I am vow'd unto anothers will. Clo. When, where, or how didst thou come by it? or Who gave it to thee? excuse my bold demand. The thing it self deserves it, as a rare And unseen jewel in this Isle before. Niso. For loves sake doe not press me to relate So long a story now, when I have left So short a time to live. I had it when I was a child, and when My better fates made me live happily, I had it from a hand that swaies the rule Of somthing else than beasts, or horned heards, I had it (nor will I deny it to be true) I had it as a pledge of love, Of faithfull love, which I long since have lost, And now within these fields (Ah me! fond hope) Go still pursuing the recovery. Of my old wonted pains. Clo. 'Tis Thirsis, it is he, 'Tis Thirsis without doubt, and to this hour Lamenting still my loss, he rangeth thus These fields to find me out: O faithfull heart! O me above all else Most happy lover! This is that blest day Which I have sigh'd for long, and this the bliss The want whereof I have lamented so, Now sighs and tears adieu, here ends my wo. Niso. Seest thou not Nerea, how she (woes me) At every pause still turns her self about, And reasons all alone? And now if I mistake her not, she seems Strangly confounded, and I know not why. Cloris. As yet he knows me not, is not assur'd, And therefore takes advice of Nerea. Nerea. Perhaps she yet suspects, and is in fear, The gift is meant to her, thou never saw'st A more reserved Wench. Clor. How can it be that love doth not ere this, At least in secret tell it to his heart? Nerea. Or else perhaps delighted with the fair: Rich beauty of the gold (as who can tell) Perhaps she may desire it for her self; For old in those that are the nicest, can Both blear their eyes, and dazle too their hearts. Niso. What ere it be, 'tis more then time my soul, Should be resolv'd at last. Clo. But foolish I, why do I thus retard My happiness? too long, too long, alas! My torments have endur'd: Nerea. Stand off, a while, Ile put her out of doubt. Clo. I will disclose my self. Nerea. Cloris. Clo. Do not disturb me Nerea, for my heart Cals me another way. Nerea. Yet stay a while, thou art too squeamish now. What i'st thou fear'st? That in this ring some train of love is layd Against thy self? be confident there's none: This gentle Shepherd here for Celia. And not for thee, for Celia, I say. And not for thee; do'st thou conceive me? For Celia he sighs, and burns, and dyes: To Celia to whom he gives his heart, To her this gift is sent, but yet thou mayst In pitty be a means to give it her. This is a smal request, and more then this Is not desir'd of thee; do thou but grant, To be the Messenger, and then let love Himself work out the rest. Cloris. Thersis, Thersis for Celia? Nerea. Niso, not Thersis: Cloris. Ah-me. For Celia doth he sigh, and burn, and dye? To Celia doth he send the Ring? and I, Must I conveigh his sacriligious gift? Niso. Cloris is troubled, and undoubtedly Will nocon sent. Nerea. Ah! though thou still be cruel to thy self, At least to others, yet be pittiful. One gentle word to do another good, Cannot, it cannot sure impeach the height And Majesty of thy just rigor. Niso. I hear Amyntas voice, but see him not, Amyntas. Cloris. Oh false perfidious love! Oh faith betrayed, Oh perjur'd Heaven! Oh most wretched I! Nerea. Ah me! and why so troubled? wherefore thus Distracted do'st thou look? and Cloris whether, Whether away so fast? at least restore The Ring again, hark, stay awhile: Scen. 5. Niso. Amyntas. Celia. Niso. Thou com'st in time, in time, Amyntas, sure The Heavens did conduct thee to this place, My lifes in question here, Amyntas, see, But whether, (woes me) whether are they gone? Vanisht so soon? What Cloris, Nerea? Cloris I say! they have abus'd me both. Follow, Amyntas, follow. Amyn. Which way shall I follow? Niso, That, And I will follow them about this Hill. Celia. Oh most delicious drink sweet to this taste Which thirsted after death. Amyn. They do not keep the path, and if they chance, To take into the Wood, I gaze in vain. Celia. I am here all alone, now in the hands Of death, why do not I then dye? Niso. This way they are not gone, is there left yet, Another way to find? Celia. Ah me! what do I see? Niso. Amyntas look! look there's my Sun. Amyn. Ah peace, if she perceive us, she will straight 'Vanish out of our sight, and then those rays Will rather seem a flash of lightening, then The chearful beams of this bright shining Sun. Niso. Already she hath spyed us, and it seems That even very now, she looks this way, But yet with high disdain: And see'st thou not! Me thinks she looks as she were full of woe: I see in that fair face, the Gilliflowers, And Roses withered, and look wonderous pale. Celia. They go not hence, nor I cannot remove Nor yet doth death come to deliver. Amyn. She reasons with her self, and happily, Shee's angry that she findes us here. Niso. But yet amidst those woes, there may be seen, A smiling beauty and a flourishing Amidst those withered flowers: Oh heavenly! Oh thou diviner beauty! can it be That other fair ones, have the fairness of The richest coulours, and the fairest flowers? But she not as from them, but from her self is fair. Celia. Unhappy eyes, what ere the world hath fair May there be seen but not by you, and then What more then death, can you desire to see? Niso. Ah me! before so fair a fire I burn, And fry in scorching heat, and canst thou then Look on it and be mute? and look again, And yet not burn? Ah! I cannot contain My self within this heat Amyn. Stay, whether wilt thou go? Niso. I must perforce, I will speak to her straight, And at the least, Ile tell her that I dye. Amynt. Speak to her man? and do'st thou not then fear The force of her reproach? hast thou forgot The cruel prohibition which she sent, Did Nereas not tell it thee? if then thou lov'st Beware thou do not move her to disdan. Cel. But from a sight so pleasing (wo is me) Mine eyes doe drink new poyson, and perhaps That may retard the operation of The drink I drunk before. Niso. Shall I then dye in silence? shall I dye Without a breathing fit? no't shall not be, The Plants at least shall hear, the Plants shall hear The mournfull accents of my sad laments, For they will be less deaf unto my moan Than Celia is, to them hard hearted she Forbids me not to speak. Celia. What do'st thou death, what darst thou not close up These eyes of mine, which love keeps open thus: Yet I must dye, and though mine eyes delay, My heart makes hast to goe that dismal way. Shepheards doe you remove unto some other place, Or I of force must flie from this. Niso. Ah! thou most cruel Nymph! Amynt. Peace Niso, peace, do'st thou not see That with her foot already in the air She threatens to be gone? lets leave her then, Lets leave her here in peace, and go our way, The Woods doe not want trees to which thou mayst As well as to these Beeches here complain, And in thy depth of sorrow sigh in vain. Niso. Lets goe, O cruel Nymph! Amynt. Ah me! most miserable! Scen. 6. CELIA. Cel. Souls of my soul, away from me you fly, And 'tis but reason, since I needs must dye: And now I dye, but you dear lovely sights Which even now gave light unto mine eyes, If ever you by chance on earth behold These most unhappy limbs here lye extinct, Depriv'd of heat and motion, not so much As one poor sigh, no nor a tear I crave. This only I entreat, that your proud feet As just revengers of your injur'd hearts, Would kick these bones unto the savage beasts, And fling the dust thereof into the air, But with that dust let then the air conveigh Into the den of deep forgetfulness All memory of my black sin. O happy death, If with my life my faults may vanish too! But I still live, and 'tis perhaps because A few small hearbs cannot prevail with death, He must have more, and therefore I have here My lap full of them, and I will renew Their poyson once again. Ah me! I dye, Amyntas! Niso! Ah I dye, O love, Betrayed love! O falsified faith! Come now behold, and see the just revenge, See and triumph, behold the vengeance due Unto my fatal error, see the end Of all my torturing pain. Come gentle plant And stay the ruins of this falling bulk, And since under thy shaddow I must dye, Ah! with those leaves, those withered leaves at least Which with the wind are tossed too and fro, For pitty cover these unburied limbs: But thou do'st fly me and so doth the earth, The heavens hide themselves, and wretched I Since neither earth nor heaven will receive This wofull soul, where shall I then remain? See, see, behold th' infernal deep there plac't; You borrid furies whereon doe you gaze? And thou black Cerberus why bark'st thou so? Make room, I come to bear a share in all The torments you endure, or rather leave, Leave all your pains to me, begon and tell That I alone will here alone make hell. Ah me! ah me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Scen. 1. SERPILLA. CLORIS. Serp. I can no more, stay here a while, and give If not unto my legs, yet to my heart A poor short breathing fit. Clo. Stay where it like thee best, for all vain Hither and thither I remove my steps, But cannot find nor hill, nor lowly plain, Nor open air, nor darksom shade that can Bring the least comfort to my wounding pain; No place can give me ease, but all alike Seems fitted to torment my wearied soul. In this same very place my woes begun, There first I view'd again my cruel foe, And here I first discover'd it was he, Here was I glad and here as suddainly, With the short sound of one sad killing word, Even in this very place, unhappy I Slipt back again into my former pain, And fell so swiftly down that precipice, As death to me cannot but now appear Tardy and slow. Serp. Phillis! ah my dear daughter, mitigate This fierce tormenting grief which thus infests Thy soul with fury: for in fine, if thou Consider well, Thirsis is still thine own, Nor lives she can deprive thee of thy hopes: True faith betwixt your gentle hearts hath knit A lasting and indissoluble knot; And love sometimes perhaps may be forgot, But never a true faith, that faith which once Jove with his thundring hand hath firmly writ, And deep engrav'd in heaven. Clo. But yet alass what can I gain thereby? For faith depriv'd of love ties up our hands, But fetters not our hearts, and thus fast bound The bonds are too too hard: For my part then Let them be loosed quite, and let me live Free from that hand that lives without a heart. No, no, Serpilla, no, if he deny His love to me, his faith I do defie. Serp. But thou dispairest yet before 'tis time, Thirsis beleeves thee dead, and justly may Within his youthfull breast then entertain New flames of love, and yet therein be free From the least shew of doing injury To that rich beauty which he thinks extinct, And happily hath mourn'd for long ago. But when he shall perceive thee here alive His old lost love will then with the revive. Clo. That love Serpilla which can be remov'd With the light breath of an imagin'd death, Is but a faint weak love, nor care I much Whether it live again, or still lye dead. Even I my self beleev'd him long ago Dead, and enclosed within an earthen Urn, And yet abhorring any other love, I only lov'd that pale-fac'd beauty still, And those dry bones dissolved into dust, And underneath their ashes kept alive, The lively flames of my still burning fire. Thou knowst it well, who oftentimes hast seen, And griev'dst to see my miserable state, My misbeleeved death then cannot make His fault, or yet my sorrows seem the less: Ah me! it cannot; no but he is false, Alass hees false, and I most wretched am, Nor can his faithless error be excus'd, Or my sad grief admit the least relief. What shall I do then? who shall counsel me? Shall love? alass it cannot; when love meets With infidelity, it rests depriv'd Of all advice; then I must now repair For counsel to my fury and despair. Serp. Come with me daughter, or at least consent That I may go and seek thy Thirsis out; Ile have him know thee once again, I must Once see you both confronted face to face, And thou shalt hear then what himself can say, And thence wee'l take advice. Clo. That ever he shall look on me again? No, I have not the heart, I know too well, That whilst I look upon his once lov'd eyes, Their beams will mitigate my just disdain, That just disdain, which I must keep entire For mine own safety, therefore peace no more, No more of that Serpilla. Serp. Yes but I must, and he must once again See thee (my heart) I will not be denied, He shall come see thee, I will have it so, If not to ease thy sad perplexed thoughts, At least to aggravate his biting wo, And now I go, but Thirsis sojourns yet At young Amyntat house, and this the path That leadeth, thither by the shortest way. Stay then at home, or for me there leave word, Where I may come to thee. Clo. Yes, yes, go on, go on. Serp. O! if I could now be so blest to free Phillis and Celia both from misery. Clo. I will leave word where thou mayst come to me. But thou must come then to deaths darksom Cell: For thither I perceive my sorrows will Bring me e'r long: Thirsis, thou nere must see This face again; for there remains no more Comfort for me; nor do I wish thy pain, For false and cruel though thou be to me, Yet I must love thee still: Ah me! I love, And if my love can for no other cause Be dear to thee, yet cruel! let it be Dear, as it will be cause of death to me: Oh my ingrateful Thirsis, Ah false man. Phillis for thee was born, liv'd by thine eyes, And now for thee forsaken Phillis dyes. Scen. 2. NISO. I here the name of Phillis, and but now, Me thinks it eccho'd through the empty ayre, Unto my lovesick soul: but whence then comes This faigned voice, which thus recals again, The cold dead ashes of my dying heart, Unto there wonted flames? can it be thou? Or i'st not rather the fair gentle shade, Of my lost Phillis? is it that which strays, Depriv'd of rest about these fields to draw My erring heart unto her love again? Alas what wouldst thou have of me? thou know'st That since thy death, no part of me remains, But tears and sighs, and if thou take delight To see me greeve, thou mai'st when ere thou please. Whilest I live here, renew the funeral pomp, Of my sad tears, and heart consuming sighs; Take then these brinish drops, rest satisfied With these deep groans, which here I consecrate, Unto our love, and to thy sweet repose, And rest, Ah me! poor soul, now rest in peace. Scen. 3. Amyntas. Niso. Amyn. Hee's all alone: Niso, whom speak'st thou to? Niso. To empty shadows my Amyntas, Ah! I know not how the mournful memory, Of my first, earnest, but unhappy love Is even now, in mid'st of my new flames. When it should least have troubled my sad thoughts Renew'd within my soul? and whilst now this, Now that, and each within an instant press Sighs from my heart, and tears out from mine eyes Tears overflow, and sighs confound me so, As my poor heart doth faint. Amyn. And so thy heart amid'st such ardent flames Such fervent heats, serves onely now to be, The hot consuming furnace of true love: Oh miserable soul! when Celia darts One flashing beam, hath it not power enough To burn one silly heart? Unless love force New flames out of a beauty now extinct? Is she not dead (if I remember well What thou hast said) who now revives thy heart. Niso. O yes she died a child, and in the East My rising Sun, declined to the West, She died a child, and if a beauty since, And such a beauty as perhaps did not Seem coy to me (such as thou seest me here) Offer'd me love, I in an instant turn'd Mine eyes another way, or dull'd their sight With the full flowing streams of showring tears; Onely the unkind beauty of my Celia, Had force to work that strange effect in me, Which the most loving beauty else could not: Nor can I tell how it was brought to pass That I could neither flye, nor yet withstand Her all commanding power: and thus new flames Without confounding of my former heat, Incense my heart a fresh, whence I am forc'd Still to bewail my Phillis, still to sigh. For Celia's love she is already lost, And her I cannot hope ere to enjoy. This then is all I can expect to gain, To lose my sighs, and spend my tears in vain, Amynt. Whilst thou do'st thus bemoan thy sad mishaps, Grief grows into excess: Let us discourse Upon some other subject: I can learn No news of Cloris, nor of Nerea, From that young Goatheard, with whom for that end I stayd behind thee talking in the wood. Niso. Which way shall we pursue them then, depriv'd Of all the helps that may direct our course. Amynt. Why should we follow thus their steps in vain? I am already weary, and 'twere best To rest us here in this large open plain. From whence we may discover round about What passeth too and fro, and underneath These spreading Beeches here we may attend In hope to meet them, and refresh our selves In this cool breathing shade, where we may dry The trickling sweat from off our melting brows, And take a sweet repose. Niso. Agreed. Amynt. But what is't I behold there in the skirts And entrance of the wood, betwixt those twigs And the round body of that tree? Niso. It seems a Nymph sure by her cloaths. Amynt. Oh! 'Tis fair Celia, see her Azure gown, Those silver buskins, and that golden Bow Shew it is Celia, which lyes here retir'd Under this gentle shade: 'Tis she. Niso. Lies Celia in the shade? behold then you That wish to see the Sun conceal his beams Under a shadow, here enjoy your wish. Amynt. Speak softly, for I think she sleeps. Niso. Sleeps she? O if some pittifull (I will not say Or God or man) but some kind gentle dream, Some wandring spirit would but whilst she sleep Securely thus present before that soul, That cruel soul, the lively image of The poor tormented Niso, with his cheeks Bedew'd with tears; his grisly pale-fac'd looks, Brought to the very point of death, and beg Some spark of pitty for me: Who can tell What hope it might produce? for sure I am That whilst I sleep I feel love waking still Even in the very shaddow of my dreams: But wretched man! to what pass am I brought When dreams and fancies must sustain my hopes? Yet now at least I may for once behold That lovely visage, unsurpris'd with fear, To see her flye me straight. Amynt. And I alass, must every moment hear Anothers woes, and yet conceal mine own, But I am silent still, because I dye Each minute that I breath, and no man cries At that same very instant when he dies. Niso. I look on every side, yet cannot come To view her beauteous face. Amyntas, see, Me thinks that Bramble-bush still craving seems With too much love to stretch his thorny twigs Too near, as if he meant to kiss The sweet vermilion Roses of her lips; O impudent bold rival, thy base briers Though arm'd with spiny prickles, shall not thus Prevent me in my happiness. Amynt. Softly, dear Niso, that thou wake her not. Niso. Ah me! so near to my beloved fire, I am all Ice, and in a shaking fit: Wonder of men! Yet thus we ought to fear The beauty we adore: I dare not move, Me-thinks great love from thence darts forth at me Invisible, strong, powerful shafts, do thou, Do thou Amyntas, who art out of fear Of all his Darts, with freer boldness try To let me see her face. Amyn. I will: But yet alas to me 'tis not a task, So easie as he deems. Niso. Amyntas, Ah! Amyntas, do'st not feel Thy trembling foot, march an uncertain pace? Stay, stay awhile, me thinks thy pale-fac't looks Tell me thy fears: yet thou art not in love: From whence then come these frights? Amyn. I cannot tell, perhaps some god-head sent From Heaven to gard these sleeping members, may Strike terror to my soul. Niso. No, no, the beauty of that face can work Awe in the boldest heart. Scen. 4. Narete. Amyntas. Niso. But go, Silvanus, go, and take a care The Kid escape not from thee, if thou meanst To keep poor Filino alive. Amyn. It is Narete. Narete. See then from him thou fly to Celia, And tell the happy tidings of her love. Niso. Ah me! do'st thou not hear Amyntas? Ha! Amyn. Narete welcome, but what happy news Hast thou for Celia, that concerns her love? Narete. That her beloved Kid is yet alive. Niso. Thanks be to Heaven, I am restor'd again Amyn. What that young Kid, which Filino, ere while Went all about Lamenting with such tears. Narete. The simple boy, beleev'd him surely dead, And he had surely dyed, had I not come, Led thither by his cryes; for he had fed Upon a poysonous herb, whose mortal juyce, First casts into a sleep, then sleeping kills, If ere the venome seize upon the heart, The visage be not bath'd, or sprinkled with Some moystening drops, which may recall again From depth of sleep, the cold benummed soul, And therefore I to whom the hearb is known Straight ran unto the Brook, and therein bath'd The dying Kid, and drew him forth alive. But what (my sons) were you beholding there Some beast within his den? Niso. O my Narete, 'tis a savage beast, I dare tell thee, no will I keep it hid; For thou art old, yet with those snow white locks Know'st how to pitty simple youthful love: Here lyes a savage beast, more savage far Then is the Basilisk, more deadly too, For he doth onely poyson with his looks: But she doth kill whether she looks or no: For see Narete, see, she sleeps secure, Yet I stand dying here: Narete. I see. And now both know the beast, and understand The poyson that she brings: and my kinde son, Would I were as well able to give help To thy disease, as I can pitty thee, 'Tis true, I'me old, but I remember yet Mine own young wanton joys, and envy not Anothers youthful love. Niso. If thou canst do nought else, yet prove at least If with thy hand though trembling thus for age: Thou hast the courage to remove those twigs, And let the beauty of her face appear: We both have tryed in vain, so sweet a task, For thence I know not how, there still breaths forth, A secret vertue; which when once the foot, But tends that way, doth stupifie the hand, And nums with cold the vigour of the suol, Even in the very Center of the heart. Narete. Hear a bewitching beauty, and a work, Done by enchantments: Womens beauty is (If yet you know it not) the Magick power Of Heaven above, by which it works on Earth, Those stranger wonders which weak men admire: And that same heat and cold that courage, and That trembling fear, with which when Heaven is pleas'd To bridle and restrain a lovesick soul, Are bare effects of her great Magick art; 'Gainst which, nor charm, nor hearb, nor pretious stone, Hath power to help, for scarce can it avail, To bear a rugged visage cover'd with, A wrinkled skin, which many years agon Was partch't with heat of the Suns burning beams: Yet I that am thus armed, may perhaps, More boldly venture on this enterprise Then you can do, and bring to happy end What you see unsuccesfully begun. Niso. Go on and prosper then. Narete. And stay you there. Niso. But hark Narete, hark, take heed thy noise Do not awake her, for thou then shalt see Her like a flash of lightning vanish straight, And after her my silly heart will run So hastily, as I shall not have time To say, poor heart adieu. Narete. Stand you concealed then, for if she wake And see not you, she will not fly for me. Amyn. Do'st hear, do'st hear. Narete. Good Heavens guard me. Amyn. Take heed least whilst thou do'st remove those thornes, No prick do race her gentle tender skin. Narete. Thou seem'st more tender far then she: Go back, and look, but yet be silent-still. Niso. Now he is there, and now he goes to work: But ah! me thinks that hand whilst thus it moves, Afflicts my jealous heart. Narete. Alas dear Shepherds, Oh! dear Shepherds run Run quick, Ah me! for Celias either dead, Or will be by and by. Amyn. Ah me! Niso. O fates! fair Celia dead? Narete. Here is no shadow, which can darken thus Her clearer colour'd face. Niso. Oh Celia! life of my life: Amyn. But I have not the courage to behold Her dying looks. Niso. Wilt thou not answer us? Ah me! sweet Celia. Nar. Niso, break thou those boughs, from off that bramble Bush, And I will draw her forth upon the grass, Amyn. Say good Narete, doth she live or no? Narete. For all this motion, I cannot perceive That yet she breaths again: But let us lay her here. Scen. 5. Niso. Narete, Amyntas. Celia. Oh my sweet Celia, Oh my dearest soul! Nar. Give way, that I may let her Bodice loose And give ease to her breast. Amyn. Lives she Narete? say? Narete. Now I may feel her heart, What leaves are these which in her bosome thus Lye here conceal'd, as if they had of late Been gather'd by her hand? Amyn. Comes she not yet unto her self? Niso. Oh sad discouler'd Roses, mixed with This perfect snowy white: loe here the shape, Which death should take, if death could then be made Subject to love. Narete. O miserable, strange unheard of case! O most unhappy Maid, unusual death! O most cruel homicide! Amyn. Ah me! then is she dead? Niso. And who was he that was the Homicide? Where is the wretch? Amyn. In what foul den, or in what horrid Cave May the most hateful Tigre be found out? Niso. Let us pursue him straight. Amyn. Lets go, Already I have kil'd him in my thoughts, And now me thinks I tear him with my teeth Down to the very heart, Narete. Fond frantick men, what fury thus transports Your erring minds? or whither will you go? Niso. To seek revenge. Narete. Ah turn again blinde men, the murderer, The Homicide is here. Niso. Come back Amyntas, her's our enemy. Amyn. And where? Niso. Where good Narete, where? Narete. See here at once, both she that did the deed, And she that suffers under it, extinct: Observe what here with her own proper hands The unhappy maid hath written in these leaves: For Niso and Amyntas, I did burn, But I was cruel, and a faithless love; And that I might not still be false to them, And cruel to my self: Lo thus I dye. O thousand, thousand times, most wofull chance! Amyn. Ah me! Niso. Ah me! so loud that Heaven it self may hear Amyntas! ah Amyntas, was this fair? Amyn. Niso, for loves-sake peace, by all the Gods Thou do'st me wrong thus to complain of me: I lov'd by force, yet never made it known. Niso. And this thy silence now brings death to me. Amyn. Ah me! no more. Niso. But since fair Celia's dead, 'tis fit I dye; And yet alas my death's not worthy hers. Amyn. Ah me! Narete, Yet I would see at least, how 'twas she dy'd. Niso. Amyntas ah! since thou did'st help to make Me thus unhappy, help me now to mourn, Narete. Her fair white neck carries no guilty signe, Of any strangling cord. Amyn. Ah me, poor soul, my grief is all shut up Within my broken heart, and there it feeds Onely on tears, and will not suffer one To spring out of mine eyes. Narete. Nor is this place neer any precipice. Amyn. But cruel Wo, insatiable griefe, Do thou devour my heart, and let my tears, Distil out of mine eyes, give way at last To pitty, that it may break up The deep abyssus of my sad laments. Narete. Her dart is innocent of this offence. Niso. Sweet Celia, wilt thou not hear me yet? Poor naked soul, to what place art thou fled? Could'st thou endure to leave this comely frame Here all alone, benum'd, and frozen thus? Narete. Her garments are untouch't: Niso. Come back, return, and look but once again Upon this lovely feature, and then fly From it, the second time, if thou hast power. Narete. What hearb is this wherewith her lap is fild? Niso, Amyntas, run, run, quickly run, Unto the nearest fountain: Niso. What neerer Fountain can there be found out Then the fresh springing current of mine eyes? Let us lament, our office is to mourn, Let bathes, and funeral piles, be others care: Narete. Alas 'tis now no time to weep in vain, Go, go, I say, fetch me some water straight To bath her face withal, leave off, begon. Amyn. What other water needs there here to bath Her face withal, which thou seest all bedew'd. With our distilling tears? Narete. Then I must go my self. Amynt. Come, come, Narete, come, me-thinks she stirs. Niso. Quickly, Narete, come, fair Celia lives, And 'gins to breath again. Nar. O blest eternal providence! O happy tears! strange, powerful Antidote! Which trickling down upon her face, prevails Against this poysonous hearb, and so recals Her wandring soul into her breast again. Niso. Ah Celia! Amynt. Celia! Nar. Disturb her not, see, she makes shew to rise; Lend her your help. Cel. How hard and wearisom's the way to death? I am quite tir'd; all my visage melts Into faint drops of sweat. Nar. Amazed yet she raves, and thinks your tears Are drops of sweat upon her fainting face. Cel. I am arriv'd at last within the skirts Of the vast shady empire, and these are The baleful Stygian fields. Nar. Go both of you and hold her up. Cel. Who presseth on me thus? now out, alass, Behold th'infernal Monsters which are wont In form of their abused Lovers to torment False faithless souls, Niso. Ah Celia! Cel. Ah me! Nar. Go from her shepheards, go, and silent stand Conceal'd apart, till I can undeceive Her poor distracted fancie thus abus'd. Cel. And yet their looks renew within my soul The wonted fire of love. Ah me, can then Th'infernal Monsters breath out loving flames? O hell is too too cruel, if it burn With the hot flames of love. Nar. O daughter! Cel. But who is he with that white hoary beard? Perhaps 'tis aged Charon, am I not Yet past then to the other side? Nar. Celia, thou talk'st idlely, call again Thy wandring sences, thou art yet alive; And if thou wilt not credit what I say, Look up and see the heavens turning round, The Sun descending down into the West, Which not long since thou sawst rise in the East: Observe that with the motion of the air, These fading leaves doe fall: In the infernal region of the deep The Sun doth never rise, nor never set, Nor doth a falling leaf there ere adorn Those black eternal plants; Thou still art on the earth 'mongst mortal men, And still thou liv'st: I am Narete, these Are the sweet fields of Scyros, know'st thou not The meddow where the Fountain springs? this wood? Euro's great mountain, and Ormino's hill? The hill where thou wert born? why do'st thou look So wistly round about? thou know'st them all; Speak then, leave musing, art not yet awake? Cel. I am alive then, it is too too true, Narete saith it, yet my sence of grief Makes me beleeve it rather true then he, But I was dead, and once I was below Within deaths empire, and there one by one Saw all the hellish furies, horrid hags, And fearful torments which doe there abide, Who then had power to draw me thus by force Out of th'infernal deep? Nar. Thy wofull lovers mourning for thy death, Were able by their tears to give thee life. Cel. 'Twas ill for me, their tears had power to make Even hell it self seem pittifull; but sure 'Twas not their tears; for I am well assur'd Where Hydra's hiss, and bawling Cerberus Sends out his howling noise, no other voice Can there be heard. It was the horror of this faithless soul Which horrid hell it self could not endure But sent it back: And woes me do I live? Doe I live still? and is my hatefull life The vomit of th'infernal pit? Niso. Mark good Narete how she is involv'd In the chymeraes still of hell and death. Cel. Unhappy life, when even death it self Proves false to thy desires. Nar. Do you without disturbing her take heed She doe not come again to her despair, And act a second death. Cel. But thou eternal justice of the heavens, Thou happily art pleased to decree That being doubly false, I should return Into this life again, that once again I might submit to death, and double death, Might so revenge my double hearted sin. Niso. But thou, Narete, whither do'st thou go? Ah leave us not here all alone to act So hard a part as this. Nar. I goe into the valley of Alcander, and Will straight return with hearbs to purge the brain, And free her from this extasie. Cel. To death then let us go, to death. Scen. 6. Amyntas, Celia, Niso. Amynt. To death my Celia? to death again? If thou wilt needs be dying, take this soul, This grieved soul of mine, and dye with it, For thou canst never dye unless it flit Out of this wounded breast. Niso. He speaks to her, yet she flies not away. Celia. Why art thou so unwilling I should dye? Wilt thou deny me then a remedy Against my wo? wilt thou contend against The just decree of heaven? Niso. Nay more, she hears him, and doth answer him. Amynt. The heavens prescribe another remedy Now to thy woes, then by a second death. Cel. What other remedy canst thou beleeve My woes can find, since even death it self, Which is the end of all mans ill, cannot Yet put an end unto my miseries? Niso. But I will soon break off this their so sweet And amorous discourse. Amynt. My death, not thine, and with my death the lo Of Niso, now the heavens have decreed To be the remedy for all thy ills. Niso. But I will not disturb them, I will first With silence hear them speak. Cel. Ah! ah! Amynt. Do not disdain me, first with favour hear The reasons I can bring. Dear Celia, If thou do'st love thy Nisoâ Niso. He pleads against me now. Amynt. With reason thou do'st love thy Niso the, Niso deserves thy love, Niso that knew How to take fire so quickly from thy flame, Even then when dying he did open first His dazled eyes to gaze upon thy light: And happy he, though late he saw the sun, Yet late it was not ere his fire begun. So that in Scyros he may rightly be Esteem'd a new come guest, but cannot yet Be tax'd for tardy love. Niso. Where will he pitch? what is it he intends? Amynt. In me, alass, what canst thou well discern? Which may deserve thy love? who every way Voyd of desert, do love and burn 'tis true; But like a sensless block that's good for nought, Such sensless blocks are long ere they take fire, But burn to ashes straight; and such am I, That could for many years behold those eyes, And never yet take fire: So late a love Cannot deserve such speedy pitty then, I am not worth thy love, nor doe I crave Thy smallest pitty, such a blessedness Great love denies me, I do onely beg That thou wouldst let me dye, and that my death, Thrice happy death may so restore thee to Thy perfect health again: then mayst thou love Amyntas and thy Niso too, and yet Be neither cruel, nor a faithless love; For loving one alive, the other dead, Him thou mayst love, enjoying love again. Me thou mayst love in mourning for my pain, Nor shalt thou mourn too long, one gentle tear Shed for my death, shall pay for all my sighs, And thou thy self shalt then with endless joy Enjoy thy Niso's love. Niso. O unaccustomed piety both of a friend And of a faithfull love, I did him wrong To doubt his truth, but now I do repent. Amynt. Then live still both, and may you happy live Whilst I dye for you both, and here I make A solemn vow to sacrifice my life To thee great love, and in thy Temple there Let this poor carkass rest. Niso. There is no longer time for silence now, 'Twere baseness to continue still reserv'd, I have a heart can die Amyntas, too Yea and a soul that can desire to dye, Nay life it self is onely dear to me, That I may live to dye, and by my death Make both my love, and friend live happily. Cel. Shepheards forbear, be silent both, and both Content your selves, 'tis I, 'tis only I That have transgrest, and only I must dye, Live both, still live, and take no pitty on A cruel, pittiless, and savage beast, Let not the love of a most faithless love Warm either of your hearts: Can you beleeve This face, these eyes, these hapless dangling locks Oregrown with grief, refus'd by palefac'd death, Can ever now be worthy of your love? Or love still if you will, Ile not gain say't: But yet love so, that love may breath disdain, No pitty in your hearts: I love Amyntas, doth not Niso then Hate me therefore? And I love Niso, can Amyntas then Be free from jealous hate? Ah me! if both, If both of you hate not my falshood now 'Tis too too sure you doe not love me then; Love is not there where when just cause doth move He breaths not fury 'gainst a faithless love: Woes me you injur'd lovers do not strive Betwixt your selves, which of you dying now Should giue me life; rather contend for this, Which of you both should be the first to strike Me dying to the heart; for 'tis high time That I my self should now conspire with you Against my self, and each of us should bring His talent to the work: you hands of wrath, And I my naked breast; you your just darts, And I my guilty soul; and when you first Have pierc'st my heart I will breath out my life. Thus you by wounding, I by dying shall Revenge your wrongs, and crown my funeral. Scen. 4. Filino, Celia, Amyntas, Niso. Fil. And art thou here? whom I had almost past Without perceiving thee, I ran so fast: Ah Celia! dost thou not know thy Cloris? ah! What heavy news of Cloris dost thou bring, Which may deserve these sighs? Say, doth she live or dye? Filino. Ah me, she dyes. Amyn. Unhappy fate. Niso. What's that he saith? Celia. Woes me! and where? and how? Filino. Within the Vale. Celia. Quickly dispatch. Filino. Gently, for I can scarce recover breath. Within the Valley of Alcander, there I left her even now, and there she lyes, Not in the shade, or on the new sprung grass, But in the parching heat, of the Suns beams, Amongst rude rugged stones: there with sad sighs, She took her leave of Heaven, and this fair light, And with a mournful voice, bad death make hast: But he was too too near, I saw him there, Where he already with his wings abroad, Had cast a gloomy shaddow ore her face. Niso. O most unhappy day! Celia. Ah me! what sad occasion wrought, This sad effect in her? Amyn. Perhaps the rumour which is spread abroad Of thy late death, Oh Celia! was the cause: For if thou dye, who would remain alive? Niso. Amyntas! is this Cloris, unto whom, I gave the Ring. Amyn. The very same. Celia. O sad misfortune! most unhappy chance! Niso. Let us go thither Celia, and perhaps We may find some relief. Celia. Filino, lets go. Amyn. Where is it that thou say'st she lies? Filino. Within the Valley of Alcandor, close Within the wood, and yet not far away, From the fresh springing fountain, there You cannot miss: but I will now return Unto my flocks, to play with my young Kid. Celia. Ah! Cloris, my sweet soul, the Heavens grant, That I may find thee but alive, and then, I cannot doubt, but when thou hear'st what cause I have to dye, thou wilt approve of all, Give thy consent, and parting kindly say: Rest my dear heart in peace. Filino. Ho! Niso, hark, a word with thee. Niso. What i'st? Fil. 'Twas almost quite forgot. Niso. Speak quickly then for Celio flies away. Folino. Stay, take it away thy self, She put it on, but I cannot undo't. Niso. Yes, yes, this is my Ring, thanks to the Gods: But yet what's this I see? here is the part Which Phillis had to boot: 'tis certain true, For round about it plainly do appear, The figures now entire, which in mine own, Were but by halves before. My Filino where hadst thou this? Filino. Cloris did give it me. Niso. And where had she it then? Filino. I know not that; but when I softly came Unto the place where she did mourning sit: I saw it lye before her on the ground, And with her weeping eyes still fixt thereon, She bath'd it with her tears, and often cryed, O false ungrateful Thirsis! O unhappy Phillis! Amyn. Ah me, what can this be? go on, go on. Filino. And whether wouldst thou have me go? Niso. How did she give it thee? what did she say? Filino, She saw me and cal'd to me, I obey'd, And with her hand, but a faint trembling hand, Cold as a stone about my neck she clasp'd This hoop of gold, and weeping to me said, But in a tone that I could scarcely hear, So weak her voice was: gentle boy, quoth she, Go, and the Heavens guide thee, go with speed: Carry this Ring, that none my see it else, Unto the Shepherd whom men here do call Niso, and say to him,â Niso. What should'st thou say to him? Filino. Disturb me not: Yes, yes 'twas even so, Say that in this entire round hoop of gold: He in Egyptian Charracters may read The falsified faith of Thirsis: say I wish That he may still live happy in his love, As I unhappy dye. Niso. Ah me, 'tis Phillis, out of doubt, What need I fear? yet see me now become In my best fortune, most unfortunate: O my sweet Phillis, is it then decreed, That I should finde thee once again alive: Onely to be th'occasion of thy death? Was not thy death sufficient in it self, To make me miserable every way, Unless my self became thy murderer? Filino. If thou wilt nothing more with me, I'me gon. Niso. But thou unhappy Ring that all at once, Art both th'accuser, and the guilty cause, Of my foul fault, go thou into the depth Of dark oblivion. Filino. Alas 'tis thrown into the stream. Niso. There, there, accuse my fault, prepare my pains And thither er't be long ile follow thee. Filino. He's grown so furious, and so without sence, As I begin to be amaz'd with fear, And therefore Ile be gon. Niso. Fool that I am, what have I done? I err'd For happily my Phillis, is not dead, But say she be not yet, 'tis too too sure That I have given her a mortal wound, And what i'st, I can hope for, can I think To hide the foul injustice of my Crime? Under a faint dismal? No: See then The just revenge of love that made me thus, With mine own tongue, and that before her face With thousand wicked sighs, and faithless tears, Accuse my self of infidelity: But be it as it will, alive or dead I wil go seek her out, and so will dye Just at her foot, that for my death at least If for nought else, I may seem dear to her. O Celia, Celia, love Amyntas now, Faithful Amyntas, live with him, and leave Me to dye for my Phillis, if I can Do nothing else, yet I can dye for her, I will dye for my Phillis: lead the way, Where art thou Fillino? but he is gone, Who now shall be my guide? Ile take my chance To him in whose vext heart despair resides Fury and rage are the most certain guides.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Scen. 1. PERINDO. O sacriledge! the royal image of Our mighty Lord, the King of mighty Kings, Before whose throne so many knees doe bow His Image on the ground? See thou divine, Thou sacred Idol, low to thee I bend, And prostrate at thy foot thus lay my head; But thou unhappy wretch who ere thou art, Out of whose hand the sacred image fell: Who ere thou art, thou dyest, nor can he live 'Gainst whom high heaven is so far incens'd As to permit him cast his life away With his own proper hands. But who was he Who was that impious wretch? how shall we learn A way to find him out? This Task must be Orontes care, within whose power doth rest The law it self, much more the punishment; To him I flye, and 'tis enough for me If I make him acquainted with the fact. But I may wander well out of my way. Yet I was here (if I mistake it not) This very morning with Oronte, yes, This is the very place, and this the path By which we came, by this we did return, And tis the shorter way. Shepheard, O ho! The ready way unto the tents? Scen. 2. Narete, Cloris. Nar. Directly forward Sir: Though to such beasts Such barbarous beasts as thou, the better way Were that which leads unto the horrid den, Of an accursed death. I did beleeve I should come short of finding Celia here, But it imports not much, since she was left In so good hands, and now my care must be Imployed here. Come on good daughter, come. Clo. Courteous Narete let me now return Alone unto my wonted solitude. Nar. No, no, thy grief is such I will not trust Thy life in thine own hands: Ile see to that, High heaven for thy safety more then hers, Guided my steps to seek for wholsom hearbs, There where I found thee dying in despair. Clo. What a strange pitty's this, Narete, know I am already dead, nor have I left Or heart, or soul, and whilst thou dost deny Me leave to dye, thou onely dost restrain This body from a tomb, not me from death, And canst thou take delight then thus to drag About the fields unburied carkasses? Nar. Thou shalt not have thy will, unless at least Thou tell me first the cause of thy despair. Clo. See where he comes, ah me! Nar. Who comes? why dost thou hide thy self? Scen: 3. Narete, Niso, Cloris. Look daughter it is Niso; Niso, ho! Where hast thou left thy Celia? whats become Of young Amyntas that I see him not? Niso. O my Narete, in how short a space How great a change is wrought in me, 'tis strange That thou shouldst know me now, I am no more That Niso that I was, nor can I say That now I live: fair Celia's no more mine, Amyntas is with her, and they are gone To seek out Cloris; and 'tis Cloris I Am seeking too, canst thou then tell me where Alive or dead fair Cloris may be found? Nar. She is alive, and is not far from hence; But what is this thou sayst? and whats the cause That thus doth trouble and perplex thy thoughts? Niso. That thou shalt hear anon, but tell me first Where Cloris is; and is she then alive? Is she not far from hence? Clo. And yet I cannot but behold his face: O with what sweetness under those fair locks Lyes maskt so false a heart? Nar. See where she is: Cloris come forth, 'tis Niso, child, come forth. Niso. Ah me, Ime dead! Nar. Thou heardst but even now, that Celia, he, And young Amyntas ran from place to place To seek thee out, and thou from thence mayst see How Nymphs and Shepheards are perplexed with The rumour of thy death. Niso. And could I see the light of those fair eyes, Blind that I am, and yet not know them straight? Clo. Thou dost not know this man, Narete, if The rumour of my death have troubled him, It is delight, not pitty doth disturb His fancy then: 'Twas he that caus'd my death, And he but comes to glory in it now. Nar. Caus'd he thy death? Niso dost thou not hear What 'tis she saith? Niso. Alass, what shall become of me? can I Yet have the heart to speak to her? can she With patience hearken unto what I say? Nar. He answers not, nor can I understand What 'tis he mutters to himself apart. Niso. Love at so great a need inspire my heart, Grant me those looks are worthy of my grief, Do thou direct my words: Phillis! ah my dear Phillis! Ah me! Nar. Phillis, art thou, or Cloris? Niso. Ah me I cannot, sighs will stop my words. Narete. Shee's so besides her self, she takes no care What 'tis I say: But tell me Niso, then. Niso. Phillis, my dearest soul: Narete. My dearest soul? this phrase too sounds of love, But sure my voice decays, and that's the cause, I am not understoop. Niso. I was deceiv'd, poor soul, I was deceiv'd. Narete. I may be yet a silent looker on, And see a wonder here. Niso. O do not turn thy face another way, Perhaps thou thinkest by denying thus That lovely visage to these eyes of mine To punish my misdeeds, but think not so, Look on me still, and mark me what I say, For, if thou knowst it not, Ile tell thee then A more severe revenger of thy wrongs, Thou canst not have then those fair eyes of thine, Which by those shining beams that wound my heart, Punish me more then all the world can do. What greater pain can'st thou inflict on me, Then still to keep as fire before my face That lovely beauty, which I have betrayd? That beauty I have lost? I have done ill, Wretch that I am, I have done very ill: And though I do complain, beleeve not yet I hope to purchase pardon by my plaints: I know too well, that from this breast of mine, And from these eyes, which could both sigh and weep For others love, No sigh, no tear can fall, Which can have power to purchase ought of thee And since that nothing but my death can please, Let then my death beg pardon for my fault, Such powerful Sutors should not be deny'd. Deny not then the thing it onely craves, For I will dye, and do thou pardon me, That's all I beg, both for my wandring soul And for this frame when it is turn'd to dust. Cloris. Shepherd the Heavens know, and love can tell Whether thou hast done ill, or no, he can Punish thy fault, and let him pardon thee, I a mean Silly Shepherdess, a poor Abused maid, forsaken, and forlorn. Have no disdain, which he need to regard, Who did so slenderly regard my love. Niso. Ah me! Clo. Ah Thirsis! Thirsis! Narete. Phillis was she before, now Thirsis he. Clo. Thou falsifier of those amorous sighs, Can it be thou that mournest? can it be? And thou that hast already kill'd me thus; Can it be thou that with such fervent zeal, Desirest now to dye, and dye for me? Cannot thy stony heart rest satisfied With my tormenting pain, unless thou strive Even in thy pitty to be cruel too? 'Tis faigned pitty, and those sighs are faign'd: I know them too too well, faign'd are thy tears, Thy grief is feign'd, and feigned thy desire; Yet can I not endure to see thee greeve, Thou I am sure thou dost but feign to greeve, The very naming of thy death affrights My poor afflicted soul: be quiet then And live, since thou hast one will dye for thee: Live and in peace enjoy thy new lov'd love, In which if thou hadst freedom by the bruit, Of my supposed (and perhaps, by thee Long wisht for death) I do not now desire My life should be the accuser of thy faults, Or interrupt thy joys: No I will dye, Take courage then, Ile dye, and pray the Heavens They may not arm their fierce revengeful wrath, Against thy faults, for if thou didst offend This heart endures for thee such horrid pains That heaven may well accept my sufferings For all thy foul offence: Why say I mine? No they are thine I had them all from thee, And I endure them all to set thee free. Scen. 4. Melisso, Niso, Cloris, Narete. Mel. O Cloris! how I tremble yet!) Dost thou not know (my child) nor do not you Kind Shepheards, know who is that wofull wight That most unhappy wight that on the ground Did cast the proud insulting image of The Thracian Emperour? Niso. And why with so much fear dost thou desire To know the man? Mel. Ah if thou know him, go and bid him fly, Fly swift away, or he's but a dead man; And shall we not be gone too daughter? for Here come the Thracians hard at hand: And now In greater rage than ever. Clo. Why should I fly away from Thracians now When Thracians are to me my best beloved? Niso. But why should that man dye? and for what cause? Mel. Their barbarous Law condemns him, thats enough. Cloris lets go; dost thou not know too well? Hast thou forgot? lets go. Nar. I prethee stay and tell me what new wo Their barbarous fury brings us, which is still Fruitfull in bringing forth our miseries. Mel. Ile tel you then, but yet do you mean while Look well about lest any of them come. The Thracians have a Law, that wheresoere The royal image of their tyrant Lord Shall be by any seen, it shall be there By him ador'd. And 'tis no less than forfeit of his life, Who shall by chance on set purpose shew The least contempt to it whoere he be. Nar. Inhumane Law, see if proud man cannot Exhalt his horns so high, till towring up At last he doth confront even heaven it self. Niso. Shepheard proceed. Mel. The Captain with his troops was going up Unto the Temple there to see brought in The tribute of our children which we pay, And I conceal'd within the bushes sate To view them as they past, when one of them, Who sure did come this way, addrest himself Unto their Captain, and thus humbly said, Behold, great Sir (and gave him in his hand I know not what, but sure it was of Gold, For in those bushes I could see no more, And scarcely could perceive the gold to shine) Behold (quoth) he the sacred image here Which even now, I found upon the bank Of a swift running stream, O sacriledg? I found it there cast down upon the ground Without respect to him whose shape it bears. At which the rest foaming with rage and ire, I know not whether out of custom, or As an effect of fury, rent their clothes: And then the Captain taking by the hand Him that had brought the news of that misdeed Withdrew aside, and talking with him there, I by a secret path thence stole away: And sure they cannot be far off; but see, See where they come: ah daughter lets away. Nar. No, for by going thus, they may conceive Thee guilty of the fact. Scen. 5. Oronte, Niso, Cloris, Melisso, Narete, Perindo. Oront. For ceatain this is it, this is the Ring, I know't exceeding well: but yet the Law, The Law is plain against the faulty man, And he without all hope must lose his head Who cast the royal image on the ground. Niso. Now Phillis thou shalt see whether my grief And my desire be feigned yea or no. Oront. If I can find the wretch, if I can find But who it was that did possess this Ring. Niso. He's found already, Sir, and comes to take At thy great hands deserved punishment. The Ring is mine, and I am he that threw The royal image here upon the ground: This is the faulty hand, and this the head Condemned for the fact to be cut off. Send for the sword then that it may revenge So capital a crime. Mel. O desperate attempt! come let us flie, Lets fly, my dearest Cloris, hence from death. Clo. Fly thou unto the place that likes thee best; For I must seek my life by meeting death. Sir, this man labours but to find the means To dye for me. The Ring is mine, and this the neck which now It hath encompast many years; for see It bears the fresh impressions of it still. The Ring is mine, and Iâ Niso. Ah Cloris! Nar. Ah me! Perind. Shepheards forbear, keep silence, and take heed That no man dare to move his foot or tongue. Oront. Thou Nymph goe on. Clo. The Ring is mine, and I was she that threw The royal image here upon the ground: And if by dying I may satisfie For such a foul offence, let no man else Pay for the forfeit I have made; for I, Even I too have a head, which once cut off, And separated from this liveless trunk Can find a way to fall, and drench in blood The fatal sword which shall revenge the wrong Offer'd unto this sacred image here. Niso. O peace a while! great Sir she raves for love, And it will not become you to give ear Unto the dreams and fancies of a Soul Grown frantick in her Passion; it is true And I will not deny but that she hath Her part in that same fatal ring, but yet No share at all in the offence; for when, Or where was it she threw it, or who can Bear witnesse of the fact? I threw it there, Just there before you, on that craggy cliffe Which to the River lends a rugged Path, I know the place full well. Per. 'Tis true, and there close by the River side I took it up. Niso. Fillino saw me when I threw it there, Poor simple Fillino, who wants the wit To frame a Lie, and he will witnesse it. Clo. Cruel! though thou hast rob'd me of Both life and soul, permit me yet at least The liberty to die. Oro. What do'st thou say Perindo? me thinks now In these their riper looks, I do perceive The lively semblance of that sweet aspect Their younger age did bear. Niso. Do'st thou my Phillis haply grieve to see That I that am thus guilty of thy death, Should die for any other cause but thine? Per. See what a strife love works, sure these are they These are those pretty little Lovers, mark How love himself is grown up with their age, And he that like a Child in Thracia, seem'd To play the little wanton in affection, now Shews forth a perfect love, which draws them thus (Do you observe it) to contend and strive How death in one may th'other keep alive. Oron. Tel me young maid thy name, where wer't thou born? Who was thy father? tell me that. Mel. Her name is Cloris and Melisso mine, She is my daughter, and we both were born Within the fruitful fields of Smyrna. Cloris. Cloris of Smyrna, and the daughter of Melisso, I was cal'd, whilst I desir'd, Under these feigned names, to fly from death, But now I am no more that Cloris, no I now am Phillis, and in Thracia Some time I liv'd, that Phillis I am now, Whose death thy cruel Lord so much desires. More of my self I know not, this may serve If onely now thou aymest at my death. Oron. Cheating old dotard, darst thou then to me With such an impudent, and shameless face Vent thy pernitious lies? Mel. Mercy great Sir, mercy I crave, my life, Lies now within your power. Arban of Smyrna, tursted to my care The charge of this young maid, and to avoyd Both hers, and his, and mine own danger, thus I labour'd to conceal the truth. Oron. Thou speak'st confusedly still, nor am I yet Well satisfied in what I did demand. Tell me in plainer terms, how first she came To live within thy power. Mel. Sir, I will tell you, but restrain a while, Your just incensed rage: Ah me! Oron. Leave off those sighs, and answer me with speed. Mel. Then when the King of Smyrna did assault The Thracians confines with his armed Troops, One of his men (that Arban, whom but now I named to you) took as prisoners. This Nimph then but a child, and with her too, A Boy about her age. Niso. And lo. Oron. Peace, not a word, but thou go on. Mel. Their looks, their cloaths, and their behaviour Seem'd to declare their fortune was not mean: And therefore Arban much delighted with So rare a booty, fearing least the King Might afterwards deprive him of his joy, Keeps them conceal'd: Nor cares he to obey A strict decree that every souldier should Deposite in his Royal hands such spoyls, And all such prisoners, as he had got. Mean while the King of Thracia, full of rage, With threatening terms, demands his children back. Nor can I tell whether that strict demand Proceeded from desire to see them dead. Clo. Oh? did not Arban, tell thee that it did? Hast thou not told me so a thousand times? From whence then on a suddain rise these doubts? Mel. Arban 'tis true, did tell me so, but yet Perhaps with art he feign'd it purposely, You Sir, are like to know. Oro. I know full well, proceed Mel. The King of Thracia, urgeth his demand The King of Smyrna, hears no news of them, And yet desires to send them back to Thrace, So to appease the high displeasure of His now incensed enemy, and to obtain A speedy wisht for peace. And therefore straight proclames just punishment To him that should conceal, and large reward To him that should discover what he sought. Arban that fear'd his yet conceal'd theft, At last might come to light, conveighs them both By night unto the neighbouring mountains, where He oft times us'd to hunt, and there be chang'd Their habit, and their names, fully resolv'd They should unknown lead a rude ruttick life, In country base attire, and that the one Might not be by the other sooner known: To me he gave this maiden and the boy, Unto Dametas, an inhabitant Of a remoter tract: Besides as one that knew 'twas ill to trust Two loving souls in two such tender breasts, He made the two young lovers each beleeve, The other surely dead. Oron. And how from Smyrna then, art thou become A dweller here in Scyros? Mel. The fury of the War increased still, And as if it intended to assault High heaven it self, it first ascended up Into those towring hills, and I, Poor I alas, when I beheld with grief, An inundation of fierce armed men, To break in round about, when I beheld Troops of proud furious horsemen swarm below, And fill the neighbouring Vales, when I did hear The shril mouth'd Trumpets eccho from the hills, With fearfull Birds, and harmlesse heards of Beasts, I took me to my flight, and hither came, Where my Progenitors at first did live, I flying came to Scyros, but Ay me! Where can we flie from that which Heaven wills, Since the great power of Heaven all places fills? Oro. And of the youth? Mel. I can tell nothing more of him. Niso. If for his death thou askest after him, Great sir, he is not far, behold me here, I am that Thirsis whom Arbano gave Unto Dametas, and with him I liv'd Untill last April, when the warmer Sun, Return'd again to melt the Icy snow, Then I alone within a steerlesse Bark, By an impetuous torrent far from help, Was driven off to sea, where onely fate Provided me of Sails, and in short space I know not how, but I was safe convey'd, And cast upon this Shore. Clo. Sir I begin to faint, grief breaks my heart, And if thou make not hast, it will deprive Thee of the honour of my death. Niso. Give ear to me, Sir, and let her alone At least till I be dead. Oro. I do both hear, and understand enough, I see that both of you desire to die, And I wil give you both content. Per. Alas, what wil you do Sir? Oro. Perindo peace. Mel. Ay me, I go, for 'tis not possible That living I should here behold my death. Oro. But let us go unto the Temple straight That in a place of greater eminence, And with more solemn pomp, th'Imperial will Of the Grand Signor may be there fullfil'd, And see you follow me. come on. Niso. O Phillis! Clo. O Thirsis, ay me! Niso. Sir, if it be resolv'd that by your hand I shall receive my death, you must resolve To kill me then, before she dying, force My soul out of this breast. Clo. No, no, if you kill him before I die, Your Pomp will be but short, for at one blow, We both shal fall to ground. Nar. O cruel strife of love! where cursed death Leads him in triumph that proves Conqueror. Scen. 6. Narete. And is it true? and am I not trans-form'd With cold amazement yet unto a Stone? Have I a voice still, and yet do not send Loud exclamation up to Heaven above? O wretched off-spring! Oh unfortunate Unhappy Lovers! you are carried now Unto the Temple, harmlesse innocent, There to be made a horrid sacrifice, And love that sees this, who would ere beleev't? Even love himself doth put the fatal knife Into the Tyrants hand. Could not our own sad miseries suffice, Woes me! but strangers too must come From forreign parts, to adde the mournfull Pomp Of their sad ruine to our endlesse Woes? Why do the Heavens lend their glorious light Still to these Fields? And why about this shore Doth still the sea, contain his angry Waves? And neither heaven yet doth hide his light Nor yet the Sea ore-flow this wretched Isle Alass for pitty let these sinful fields Now made the horrid stage of wrath and ire Be overwhelm'd by inundation, And so conceal'd under the raging waves Of a tumultuous Sea. Scen. 7. Ormino, Sireno, Narete. Orm. Whence dost thou come Sireno? Sir. From the Temple straight. But from that Temple dear Ormino which Is now become to us the Theater Of wo and misery, I fly from thence, From whence and from the sorrows which it brings. Pitty it self, for pitty flies away. Nar. Do'st thou Sireno from the Temple fly? And from the horrid spectacle it shews? But how couldst thou have notice with such speed Of that sad sight? have they then wings to fly So soon unto their death? It cannot be That when thou camst from thence, Oronte should Be with th' unhappy couple there arriv'd. Sir. Oronte, no; but with their ill born babes The mournfull mothers are already brought To pay their tribute in the temple, O sad sight! They there are drawn together in a troop, Like to feerful heard that stands amaz'd, Encompast round with cruel forragets Ready to seize the spoyl; They clasp their little children in their arms, And with sad weeping eyes behold them so, As whilst their sorrows sends distilling drops Down to their bosoms, the poor infants suck More tears then milk from their unhappy breasts: And that same troop of cruel hellish curs Encircle them about, and view their prey With devillish delight, impatient yet Of any small delay, since now the wind Sends prosperous blasts to fill their wicked sails. Orm. O most inhumane tribute! endless wo, And infinite misfortune, that men should Thus generate their children to become Slaves to their foes, and fathers be constrain'd To mourn more at the birth then at the death Of their unhappy ofspring. Nar. But I speak of another misery, The tribute is inhumane, 'tis most true, But yet a more inhumane cruelty Is like to make the temple now become A bloody Theater, whereto the fierce, The hellish Idol of a pittiless Inexorable Godhead, to th'incens'd And raging fury of those snarling dogs, For having here despis'd the image of That proud insulting tyrant, even now Oronte is gone up to sacrifice Two young unhappy lovers. Or. O you celestial powers shall then mans blood Thus guiltless shed, defile those altars which Are dedicated to your deities? Sir. Alass, me thinks I see the Temple shake, And totter under their revengefull hand, As too too weak to undergo their rage, It needs must fall to ruin, and the walls Must of necessity by tumbling down As from a precipice, upon their foul, Their wicked heads, revenge the lasting shame Of such a horrid fact. Orm. But what occasion, or what wicked rite Doth move their impious sword to offer up So infamous a sacrifice? Nar. 'Twere too too long to tel, I scarcely have Breath left enough to sigh. Orm. Yet tell me who those woful wretches are. Nar. Niso and Cloris, poor unhappy souls. Orm. O cruel destiny! Sir. Cloris the fair young daughter of Melisso here? Nar. The very same, but Niso is no more That Niso that he was, nor Cloris now Is Cloris or Melisso's daughter but They both have other names, and both were born To other fortunes, other strange events. Orm. What names? what fortunes? or what strange events? Nar. The name of Niso now is Thirsis. Orm. Ay me! Nar. Of Cloris if I well remember it, Is Phillis. Orm. Ay me! Sireno. Siren. Ormino! Thirsis and Phillis were our children call'd, Whom in their infancy they took for Slaves And carried into Thrace. Who knows but they are they, for if they live Still to this hour, they must be of their age And like to them youthfull and fair. Nar. Your children these, fie fie, restrain your fears, Leave off so fond a thought, I blush for shame, Your children (mark me) those young Imps whom once They carried into Thracia for Slaves, Must now with in the grand Seraglio, If now they live, amongst those Troops of Slaves With shaved heads, lead a most slavish life, Dis-figured so as they can scarce be known By those that gave them suck: where these Richly adorn'd, within the Thracian fields Were in the Wars there by a Souldier Of Smyrna taken Prisoners; and are not then Poor Shepheards children, but of that discent, As that their fortunes have had power to move Cares, and disdains, desires, and fears, and wars And that in mighty Kings. Sir. Ay me! no more Narete. Orm. Ay me! they are the same. Nar. Ay me! how can that be? Scen. 8. Serpilla, Ormino, Sireno, Narete. Serp. What mournful Ay me's, what indiscreet Importunate laments, does thus per turbe, Our comon joys, in which both earth &amp; heaven Do seem to smile upon this happy Isle? Narete, Siren', and Ormino too. You happy Shepheards of these happy fields, You blessed fathers of an issue blest, Cease from your sad laments, and chear again Those mournful voices now grown hoarse with cryes, Dry up those eyes, and let them weep no more, Or if they weep let them weep tears of joy, And not of grief, for lo behold I come The cheerfull messenger of happy news. Orm. Siren' what can this be? Sir. Alass I cannot see which way to hope For the least shew of comfort. Nar. O soul abased by excessive grief, Canst thou repose so little confidence In heaven which can do wonders? Serp. Go presently unto the temple, go And there see Thirsis and his Phillis too, See both your children there, whom long ago You gave for lost, and mourn for now as dead. Go to the temple, and you there shall see Amyntas and his Celia, both of them Your children too, and enemies before, Profest to love, who yet were even now For love both hasting to a wilful death: Why do I hold you thus, and one by one Declare your joyes? go to the temple straight, And there behold this Isle, this little Isle, Fill'd with as great a joy, as much content As such a little Isle can comprehend. The sad despairing lovers are espous'd, This Island from an horrid tribute freed. The day is come, O thousand thousand times Most happy day, the day is come when once This little Isle is set at liberty. Sir. O you supernal powers! Orm. Serpilla! Ser. But Why doe you still delay the time, the hours, The flitting hours of mans quick fading life Are too too short, and too too long the woes That doe attend it still, doe not retard your bliss, Go to the temple straight, go you your selves And their behold your joyes. Sir. Lets go Ormino, lets go, that once Yet ere we dye these eyes of ours may be Blest with this unexpected happiness. Orm. Lets go but whither? thou Sireno guide My fainting steps, for I know not which way To move my trembling foot. Scen: 9. Narete, Serpilla. Nar. Here me Serpilla, stay, I held my peace With pain 'tis true, but yet I held my peace, Nor would I let my doubts disturb the joyes Of these two good old Shepheards here, but yet I understand them not, thou do'st let loose With too too large a stream, the torrent of So many comforts on a narrow heart, Infuse it gently therefore drop by drop, And tel me first, that Thirsis, and that Phillis which Before were Niso, and fair Cloris call'd, Those whom but now the Thracian Captain led To a most certain death, shall they now live? Serp. They both shall live, and are become withall The most contented happy lovers that Ere yet did sigh for love. Nar. And was it not then true, that for desire, Cruel desire of their long wisht for death, The Thracian Emperour did with such rage Demand them of the King of Smirna? Serp. That I cannot tell, but sure I am that Thrace Is th'onely authour of their happiness. Nar. Yet Cloris did affirm it here, but she Was certainly deceiv'd by the fraud Of him in Smirna that conceal'd them both, And with good cause Melisso did suspect That he did but dissemble what he said, That so they both of them for fear of death Might labour with the greater art to keep Themselves from being known. Serp. 'Tis true Oronte saith it too. Nar. O then how vain is humane providence? He sought to cover that by fear of death Which now desire of death hath brought to light. But for the fault about the hoop of gold Which here was carelesly thrown on the ground For the contempt against the image shewn, How could Oronte find a means to save The guilty person thus against the Law? Serp. Their case was dangerous and for my part I gave them both for dead, and mourned for Their hard mishap; but see how it fell out, Wearied with following Niso whom I sought, I sate me down close by the temple side, Where straight a rumour was disperst abroad, I know not well from whence, that all in hast Oronte then was coming, and did bring Unto the temple two unhappy wights, Before condemn'd to dye for their contempt Unto the royal image of his Lord: At whose sad coming the proud Thracians seem'd To laugh for joy, and so from thousand tongues Sent forth one cry that reacht to heaven it self, Exclaming let him dye, O let him dye: But presently Oronte darts about A fierce imperious look, at which they all Amaz'd in silence mutter'd not a word When he reply'd, Hear O you Thracians, hear The supream Laws of Thrace have onely force Within the Thracian Empire, and against Those that do serve the Thracian Emperour, But Scyros is not as you now beleeve Subject unto that Empire, hear your selves Th' Imperial decree which in this Ring, This very Ring it self, in which engrav'd The royal Image stands, is written here In fair Egyptian Charracters, and then Ile read it with a voyce so audible, And I with that attention heard it read, And have it fixed so within my heart, As I dare confidently swear I can Repeat it word for word. Nar. O then repeat it as thou hop'st for bliss. Serp. âPhillis, and Thirsis, two descended from âSireno, and Ormino, when they come, âWhere ever Heaven shines, there let me know âLove made them lovers, faith combin'd them so âThat they were both contracted: Destiny âHad made them slaves; the King hath set them free âAnd for their sakes, Scyros is from this day âFree'd from the tribute which it us'd to pay, Thus he: (and casting then a look that way) These (he replied) these are those happy two Whom their more gracious stars could make so dear To Heaven, and to their King, these same are they I know them very well, let that suffice To you O Thracians: And do you two live (Quoth he) then turning with a gentle smile To those two happy lovers) live you still And live still to enjoy your constant love, By free possession of your spousal rites. Let these sad Mothers take into their Arms Again their little children, and let all With chearful acclamations sound aloud, The liberty of Scyros. Nar. O amongst all whom the blest sun doth warm With his reviving heat, and when the Sea Bathes with his quiet waves, dearly belov'd, And by Celestial providence now made Most happy Isle! the winds shall now no more Conveigh thy mournful sighs, above the waves, After thy dear lost children: but the babes Whom thou do'st generate, shall bless their birth, And be by thee sustained whilest they live, And when they dye rest in thy graves in peace, That so thou mayst to thy dear issue be A fruitful Mother, and a careful Nurse, And left a Tombe to free them from the curse, Of wandring souls, that find no sepulchres, But Phillis, then and Thirsis, what said they, Or how did they behave themselves? Serp. Their first encounter was, (like such as seem'd Retir'd for fear, and much perplexed with The suddain tremblings of a doubtful heart) Bashful and nice, and being thereto drawn Even by Orontes self, who joyn'd their hands They seemed to embrace unwillingly, And kiss as 'twere by force; But having fuel thus put to their fire, It quickly then encreased to a flame, And each hug'd other so, as you may see, The twining Ivy when it seeks to clasp, A full grown Elme, as if it seem'd to say It could not well subsist without that stay. Then might you see from one to others mouth A thousand kisses in an instant sent, And whilst their amorous lips as overcharg'd Stood sucking here, and there loves Nectar thus, That sweetness, followed, and that Rubie Die, So grac't those lips as that they seem'd to me Flowers that did bear both honey, and the Bee, So that at last you might perceive the cleer, And lively beams of their quick piercing eyes, Grow faint and dul, as overcome with sence Of too much pleasure, and extream delight, And I that saw it, sayd within my self Ah me! 'twere to be fear'd these two would dye, But that ther's hope that in a skirmish of So many kisses, neithers soul can find A way to vanish, and leave them behinde. Narete. And could poor Phillis then so soon put off The thought of her disdain? could she so soon Forget the injury of that new flame Wherein her Thirsis burnt for Celia? Serp. It seems that yet thou do'st not understan The laws of loves kind duels, thou must know A venie of sweet kisses one to one is able to give satisfaction For any injury love can sustain: But if thou dost consider all things well Tirsis did her no wrong, he was deceiv'd, And did beleeve her dead; and tis well known That loves great empire though't be vast and larg, Doth not extend beyond the bounds of life, Love hath no jurisdiction ore the dead, Nor can his fire raise any kindly heat Amongst those frozen reliques, those cold bones: Besides all this, if any mark can rest Of fault in Thirsis, he hath shed those tears That may suffice to wash away the stain, And what can she have more? poor soul in deep Repentance for his errour, he did here Submit himself to death, and happy was That Errour that could find a way to make So generous amends. Or rather happy was that errour which By erring thus could find a way to make So many blest, whom it did not offend. His love to Celia was the happy cause Of all our happiness, for thence it came That Thirsis was first known to Phillis, then Phillis to him, and last of all, that both Were to the Thracians known. Nar. Thou saist exceeding true, and now behold How full of windings and obscurity Those secret wayes are, which the Gods do use. Who would have thought them so? in sum 'tis true That heaven is a labyrinth, in which Who seeks to spy out what th'eternal fates Have there decreed may easily lose himself. But then I fear least Celia's fervent love Which yet is fuming hot, should still disturb If not young Thirsis with his late quencht heat, Yet Phillis with a jealous freezing cold, 'Tis not a task of easie labour thus Within an instant to extinguish quite Both love and jealousie. Serp. What is it thou do'st dream? if Thirsis be Son to Ormino, must he not then be Brother to Celia too? Nar. Forgetfull that I am! these many strange And unexpected changes, have almost Depriv'd me of my sence: Thirsis it is true A brother unto Celia, and their love Must now be at an end. But what becomes Of Celia and of Amyntas then? I cannot yet conceive a way to find A wisht for end to their despairing greef. Serp. In that same very point of time (behold A fatal point of time) they came unto The Temple: Where fair Celia sees fast tied Within the arms of Phillis her belov'd, And yet beleeved Niso, guess you then What posture she was in: She straight grew pale With jealous rage, and cold as any stone And that she died not then, I think the cause Was onely that her grief pend up her soul Within her frozen heart. Thirsis that saw it, quickly freed himself From those imbraces wherewithall he held His Phillis in his Arms: And running straight Unto her said. O my dear Celia. My dearest Sister, but no more my love, I am Ormino's son, Thirsis, and so Become thy brother, our affections er'd For nature should have guided them, not love, Let us submit then to a lawfull love, And spend our erring flames, where they may find Fit objects for their heat. She whom I did beleeve dead long ago Is sister to Amyntas, and my spouse, Espoused to me in her infancy, Thou that art now my Sister shalt enjoy Amyntas for thy husband, both your loves Deserve it well, and I am well content All that did hear him, smil'd, and she that yet Amaz'd perhaps at such a sudden change Well understood it not, when more at large And more distinctly she had been inform'd, Her fancy freed her heart inlightened with The sence of truth, made her clear up her looks And give a cheerfull smile. Nar. But then what said she? Serp. Nothing but half asham'd she did cast down Her eyes unto the ground, when yet her heart Sent through her eyes, two gentle tears that fell Like tears of joy and gladnesse, to declare The sweet content she found. Nar. O thou most blest Amyntas who hath kept The laws of love, and friendship so intire As that 'mongst friends and lovers thou may'st raise Statues of joy, and of eternal praise. O thou most blessed Celia! see the Hervens Have hitherto been pious lookers on, And pittifull beholders of thy woes O heaven! O earth! O sea! O we most happy all! But you dear lovers above all the rest, Phillis and Thirsis, O for ever blest! Serp. Since thou art satisfied, I now will go And tell these joyfull news in other parts. Nar. See how the heavens in an instant have Dissolv'd the most intricate hard knots, That ever turning fortune yet did knit, And that when unto humane reason they Appear'd indissolable: such the strange Eternal power is of high providence, And now may future ages fill their Scenes With stories of our unexpected joy Such is the Will of heaven, in disport, And in th' Abissus of his secret power, Thus to confound poor silly mortal men, You therefore that with high presumption think By humane wisdom to discover all The secret workings of eternal fate. Learn from this wonderfull successe, to know That he alone can see these sacred things Who shuts his eyes, and trusts what heaven brings. FINIS.</field>
