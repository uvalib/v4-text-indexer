      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE Scene: The main-deck of a ship on the Irish Sea The mast, on which the great striped square-sail is set, L.; the forepart of the poop, with ladders leading up from the deck, appears R. Between the ladders, in the bulkhead of the poop, is the curtained door of Isolt's cabin. Across the back of the stage runs the port bulwark, the closed gangway in the middle. Left of the gangway, under the bulwark, is a large loose coil of rope. Under the poop, between the door of the cabin and the farther ladder, is placed a movable seat. Abaft the mast, a great curtain of painted canvas hung from a rope, which runs from shroud to shroud across the deck, shuts off the forepart of the ship. A gloomy dawn is breaking, the poop lanterns still burning. A dark expanse of sea is visible over the bulwark. The curtains of the cabin, of some rich stuff, are closed. Three sailors of the watch pace irregularly fore and aft. In the tops a young sailor is on the look-out. Caradoc. Blow wind, sail ship! A glad man I will be with this voyage well over. Llewellyn. Cheer up, Father Caradoc! 'Tis the Cornish land will be our bed to-night, my old seal of the sea. Cara. O ay!âif Cornwall be within cry of these waves. I have heard tell of the ships that sail for ever, yet never make port. Mardoc. It is wicked freight they will be carrying. Llew. What about this fair cargo Sir Tristram is bringing King Mark? [Points to cabin. Cara. [Mysteriously.] Isolt of Ireland? Since she sailed with us I have heard things on the blast, seen things in the seaâterrible thingsâO ay! Llew. A fair face she has; but a foul temper, I doubtâ eh, Mardoc, lad? Mar. Och, man Llewellyn, but I would sooner see the frowns on her than the smiles on any other woman whatever! Llew. Yet Sir Tristram keeps well out of shot of her smiles or her frowns. Spin us the yarn of that; for 'tis five year gone since I have seen a Cornish daisy. Cara. There is the blood-feud between themâO ay! Llew. The blood-feud? Cara. She was troth-plighted to yon Irish giant that Tristram slewâwhat will be his name? Mar. Morough. Cara. O ay! This Morough was her lover. When he came from the Irish king, Angus of the Black Ships âIsolt's fatherâto get for him the tribute from King Mark, young Tristram challenged him; and they fought in lists on a sandy isle of the seaâO ay! âa sandy isle of the sea. And there did Tristram slay him; and in the casket he brought for the tribute his own head went back to Ireland. Mar. And in the bone of its brow a splinter of Tristram's sword. Cara. O ay! And at the sight of it the life went out of the Irish king, for the wrath and shame that was on him. And so ended a bad custom, O ay, indeed! a very bad custom! Llew. No love is lost then between our new queen and Sir Tristram? Mar. Love or no love, she will have put spells on him. Llew. Spells? Mar. Sir Tristram took a wound from Moroughâa magic wound it was, none but an Irish witch could heal; yet healed he was, and the secret of his healing tongue has never told. But from that day the glad song is no more in his heart, and he himself will be looking like a death-doomed man. Cara. Death-doomed he isâO ay! Llew. They say there is the second sight in that one eye of thine. Cara. I saw the shroud at his feet, and now it is risen to his knee. And the death-shroud is at her knee too. They will die the one dayâO ay, indeed! Llew. Well, Death will get us allâsome day. Mar. But, Sir Tristram he will be marrying himself against the other Isolt, when King Mark has got this one. [Points to the cabin. Llew. The other Isolt? Cara. Isolt of BrittanyâIsolt of the White Handsâ O ay! Look-out. [From the tops.] Land ho! Land on the lee bow! Llew. [Seizing the shroud and leaping on the bulwark.] Bravely blown, North Wind! There stands old Dundagil. How about your bodings now, mate? Cara. There is no end to Irish Druidries. I have my bodings still. Pilot's voice. Stand by your braces, men! Ease away the sheet! [Sailors trim braces and sheets and exeunt L. [The ship's course is altered and a distant headland appears on the backcloth L. Brangwaine comes out of the cabin, looks over the bulwark, and returning quickly to the cabin calls to Isolt. Brangwaine. Land, land, Isolt! Isolt of Ireland. [At the cabin-door.] What means this cry? Where are we? Bran. The clouds give way, rent by the rushing north, and the ships strain for port. I feel my feet almost on Cornish land. Is. of I. [Rushing out.] Land, land! O never come safe to land the ship that bears Isolt to Cornwall and King Mark! Bran. A black wish on us all! Is. of I. How long have we been sailing, days or years? Bran. Three days, three nights, and now the fourth morn breaks. Is. of I. Three days, three nights of sailing; and this dark hour The first I have looked in the sea's wizard face! Hark how the keening wind sweeps from the shroud Lamenting tones, and plays upon the ship As on a Druid's harp! [She draws Brangwaine to the bulwark Look down, Brangwaine: See how the subtle water, flecked with foam, Darts from the plunging prow, and speeds by us Writhing and hissing softly like a snake. Its horror fascinates. Dost thou not dream Of rare and delicate deaths, gentler than sleep, Down, fathoms down, through the green glimmering sea Following the diving eye, till wandering light Swoons, mazed and lost in perilous ways obscure? Bran. Hush! for the sea may hear. Your mother's spells Have sunk, ere now, brave ships. Is. of I. [Stepping back from the bulwark and sinking down upon the coil of ropes.] O forlorn mother! Her sorceries have grown tame since Ireland cowers Before her tributary: she can but brew Love-drinks and bale-broths every witch-wife knows, Not storms. Where are thy spells, mother, That whispered lightly to the purring surf Could sink us now? Bran. Tempt not the sea, Isolt! Is. of I. [Coming forward.] Winds, winds of the sea, can ye not hear The storm within my breast with sister's cry Call you to rage? Hound on your hungry pack Of howling waves, white wolves of the grey waste, To hunt the staggering ship; whelm in one wreck A hundred guiltless, with one guilty head! Bran. Call not the winds to chafe the spleenful sea. Is. of I. They hear me not! No more weak blustering words. I have a thing to doâa thing to do! Bran. What sleepless worm gnaws at your hidden heart? Is. of I. Blood cries for blood. My bridemaid, Vengeance, wakes! Bran. Did you so love Morough that for his deathâ Is. of I. Who told thee I loved Morough, that I hate him? [Indicating Tristram.] My heart has grown so poor in natural hate That for mere shame I must abhor myself Till we rest even with them, head for head. Tristram. [From the poop.] Deck out the ship in all her bravery, Ancients and pennons to the following winds, Hoist on the poop the standard of King Mark! [The sun shines out. Sailors hoist flags. Is. of I. [Looking at the flags.] See how this haughty vassal of King Mark Triumphs above my captive head, and tames The servile waves to be the ministers Of his insulting pageant! Bran. He ordains But fitting honours for the chosen bride Of his great uncle. Is. of I. O how he honours me! Three days and nights the melancholy fields Of ocean we have sailed, and yet not once Has he with knightly homage kist my hand. Bran. The custom of his office bids him show A liege's dread in distant courtesy. Is. of I. [With scorn.] Ay, morn and eve his blunt squire, Kurvenal, Comes with scarce-hidden malice in his smile, To spy if tamely I endure my cage. I am a queen by proxy, proxy-wooed, And proxy-wedded; and by rule of state Should love King Mark by proxy. Bran. Idle words! What would you have? Is. of I. Bid Tristram come to me. Bran. [Looking towards the poop.] How great must be King Mark, lord of such knights! Is. of I. [Turning her back towards Tristram.] A doughty champion trulyâdares not look His captive in the face. Bran. Dares not? Is. of I. Ay, dares not! Bid him on his allegiance come to me, And with his harp make music that can steep The present in oblivionâGoâdefy him! Bran. Defy him! Wherefore? Is. of I. Spend not thy breath, but go! [Exit Brangwaine. Isolt turs and looks at Tristram. Set are the lists of fate, the herald hour Blows a stern summons on the hastening winds, And vengeance claims yon death-devoted head, This death-devoted heart. Would it were done, And peace for ever sealed between us twain! Re-enter Brangwaine. Well? Dares this Cornish lion look on me? Bran. He lays his homage at his lady's feet, But duty to his sovereign chains his hand Fast to the helm, till we ride safe in port. Is. of I. [Laughs.] His sovereign is pale fear, he dares not look A woman in the face. Did he not blench, Hearing my name and message? Did he not blench? Bran. His face grew pale; but stern his fearless eyes. Is. of I. 'Twas not so once. His face in peril's face Kept its own manly red. Many a strange tale Sleeps in a woman's heart, untold, untold! He will not come, then? Bran. He but keeps his vow. Is. of I. What wilt thou wager he will keep it still, Though I again demand his presence here? Bran. My girdle against yours. Is. of I. I'll win my stake. Bran. Are you so sure? Is. of I. Brangwaine, dost thou remember That nameless knight whose magic wound I healed? Bran. I heard the tale, the man I never saw. Is. of I. Once, while he slept, his sword did I unsheath And the gapt blade showed its own secret wound. Then from my breast, where burning cold it lies, I plucked this fateful splinterâwhich gave death To Morough in his last inglorious field; And by the token of the sword made whole I knew his deathsman. [Showing the splinter in an embroidered case. Bran. Tristram! Is. of I. Ay, Tristram. Bran. What ransom paid he then his deadliest foe, To keep his perilous secret so well? Is. of I. He woke from sleep, and saw me with the sword Stand like eternal vengeance over him. Yet on the sword he looked not; but his eyes Looked into mineâand after that long look The sword fell, and I wished him scathe no more Bran. What spell took hold on you? Is. of I. Was it not some spell? Are there not dark enchantments shot in a look? Yet the new faith bids âlove your enemiesâ; Fools may! This Tristram took his life from me But as a loan I might require again. Bran. His life? Is. of I. So hath he sworn. His tenure holds But while I keep this shred of his own sword, [Showing the splinter. When I put in this pledge I claim in full. Bran. O fling that ghastly token in the sea! Is. of I. That splinter gave Ireland to grey King Mark. Bran. King Mark is yours. Is. of I. Carrion for kites! This bond Shall yield me in its quittance blood for blood. Bran. The blood-fine has been paid for Morough's death, His bones with reverence buried. Is. of I. Let him rest! But for my country's honour gored and slain, What blood-fine? For my father's head gone down In shame, what blood-fine? For their slights to me, What blood-fine? Bran. Is this passion love or hate? Is. of I. There was such parting twixt us as when two Who haunt each other in the soul of sight Must smile with hidden hearts; when every word Is dark with things unsaid. It maddens me To think how then we parted. And this man Comes backâthis man to whom I gave dear lifeâ And haughtily demands me for King Markâ O death, death to us both! Bran. Wedding King Mark you heal not one red wound, But many wounds which drain two bleeding lands. Surely his very fame blown in her ears Might win a woman, though your mother's care Had brewed no love-drink for King Mark and you. Is. of I. [Scornfully.] The love-drink! Bran. None shall sunder whom it binds! Is. of I. O careful mother with her beldame's charms! I would herself had wed this ancient king, And drunk with him; or thouâNow by the rood This is thy dream! Bran. [Laughing.] May fate no worse be mine! Is. of I. There is another potion in thy care, That which, when it shall spice the brimming mead, Lives are but bubbles at the mead-horn's brim. Fetch me the casket which contains that drinkâ The death-drink! It enshrines the last stern word Of mother's love to the new-wedded brideâ It fills my heart with whispers. Darest thou speak That word, Brangwaine? Bran. âBetter be dead than false!â Is. of I. O tenderly my mother counsels me! Fetch here the casket. [Exit Brangwaine into cabin. Better dead than false! Enter Kurvenal. He brusquely salutes Isolt. Kurvenal. My service to you, Princess! Is. of I. Well sir? Your message? Kur. Fair landing after foul voyage! 'Twill be anchor down with us anon, and then after long tossing we shall ride safe in the shadow of King Mark's land. Is. of I. What more? Re-enter Brangwaine with the casket. She remains in the background. Kur. My noble master, Sir Tristram, bade me say, that being safe over the sea we must now go ashore; and as we have decked the ship out in all her bravery, so we must make ourselves brave in holiday weeds and holiday faces. Is. of I. Oh, for that you must trust my vanity! Kur. I thank you, madamâand so I take my leave of you. [Going.] Is. of I. Stay, sir! Can you vouchsafe me a word more? Kur. As many as you please, an they be brief. Is. of I. I would speak with Sir Tristram. Kur. That's as it may be. Is. of I. What must be shall be. As thou lovest thy master, give him this token [gives the splinter], and say I await his coming. Kur. As I love my master? I'll do it. May all your days be happy! [Exit Kurvenal. [As Brangwaine comes forward with the casket, a rocky promontory appears close to the ship on the backcloth R. Is. of I. The casket! [Brangwaine gives her the casket. She opens it. In which phial hides the juice That gives to mortal hearts immortal sleep? Bran. The death-drink! Ask not that! Is. of I. I need not ask; For now I well remember 'tis the golden. Is it not so? Bran. Yes. Is. of I. 'Tis well shrined. The best Should hold the best. Pale silver is too mean To shape the flower whose honey cloys desireâ [She takes the golden phial and gives the casket back to Brangwaine. Have this still in thy care. There lurks more danger Within, than in this physic for hot blood. Bran. You tread the ways of madness! Is. of I. Peace; no more! Fill me with sparkling mead my golden cup. And set my table here, the cup upon it! Bran. Isolt! what would you do? Is. of I. Drink peace with Tristram. Away! [Exit Brangwaine into cabin. To die! To still the bounding veins Of passion in full ache! In the sick world Where age binds youth, and the false marriage bed Is but love's death-bed, what is there left to do But stop the beating heart? [Calls.] Brangwaine, the cup! Re-enter Brangwaine. She places the table and sets the cup upon it. Is. of I. 'Tis well. Now, quick, Brangwaine, my broidered mantle My royal brooch, my tire! I must make ready To meet my royal bridegroom like a queen. [Exit Brangwaine. Isolt gazes at the phial. O shrine of rest! My eyes looking on thee See but blue lurid flowers, my bridal flowers, That ominously wave o'er drowsy roots Whose clotted venom I hold cloistered here. I see my mother dig them at full moon In her witch garden, muttering magic wordsâ Come, Wolfbane, whose blue flowers with trembling hand I dared to pluck, a child, be thou the bale Of Tristram and Isolt! [She pours the contents of the phial into the cup. 'Tis done; and now This empty tribute to thy waves, O sea! [She flings the phial into the sea. Re-enter Brangwaine with mantle, etc. Bran. [Looking at the cup.] Isolt! Let me but knowâ Is. of I. Be wise, know nothing. [She casts off her mantle. Slip off this belt! My girdleâset it straight. Good haste, no hurry. Bran. O, my fingers tremble! Is. of I. I tremble not; have thou no dread! [Brangwaine clasps the girdle, brings forward a chair and Isolt seats herself. My mirror! [Brangwaine gives her the mirror, and proceeds to adjust her tire, and fix the golden apples at the ends of her long plaits of hair which she brings over her shoulders. Is. of I. Do I not look the bride for a great king? Bran. I never saw such stern eyes in a bride. You cannot think of death? Is. of I. [As Brangwaine puts on her armlets.] Nay, of rich life That bursts the bondage of this common clay And wings eternity. [She rises. [Brangwaine puts on the mantle, etc. Isolt laughs. This Tristram scorns us. [Suddenly clasping Brangwaine in her arms and kissing her. Farewell, Brangwaine! [Kissing her again. This kiss take to my mother. Tell her how dearly I thank her for her cure For wanton blood. Better be dead than false! Bran. [Struggling to reach the cup.] O, this is madness! Is. of I. Touch not that sacred cup! If thou but spill from it one golden drop, May devils dash thee from thy hopes of heaven! [She thrusts Brangwaine away to C., glances at the poop, and takes the cup. Sir Tristram quits the helm! These weeds away! [Brangwaine takes up the old mantle, belt, etc., and exit into the cabin as Kurvenal enters from the poop. Kur. Sir Tristram comes! Is. of I. I am here to give him welcome! Enter Tristram moodily, Isolt's token in his hand. He salutes Isolt. Kur. [Aside, and plucking him by the sleeve.] Ware danger, Tristram! Trust not woman's tongues! Tris. Leave us alone. See all prepared for anchoring. [Exit Kurvenal, L. Madam, you send for me in pressing terms. Is. of I. Nay, in more pressing terms I sent before, And yet you came not. Why am I flouted thus? How is it, sir, that for three weary days You break not, to beguile my melancholy, With harp or song, or any cheerful speech, The long monotonous chanting of the sea? Tris. Even as you know, I am dear honour's thrall. Is. of I. What hold'st thou in thy hand? Tris. My, life, I know, Perchance my death. If so, here is my swordâ Avenge your lover! [Kneels and offers his drawn sword. Re-enter Brangwaine. Is. of I. Sheathe itâthat blade remembers It once from my weak hand fell at a look. The past is dead, drowned in this loving-cup. [She takes the cup. He rises and sheathes the sword. Come, drink forgiveness of thy thousand wrongs! Bran. [Aside.] It is the love-drink! Tris. Though it be death, I'll pledge thee! Bran. [Who has drawn gradually nearer.] Tristram, drink not! Is. of I. Peace, fool! See, Tristram, thus I drink to thee! [She drinks. Brangwaine sinks back on the seat and covers her eyes. Tris. Hold! I demand the cup! Is. of I. Nay, have no fear! I will not stint thee of one rightful drop. [She hands him the cup. Tris. [Raising the cup.] Peace be between us two! [He drinks. Is. of I. That peace is madeâ Now, Tristram, look thy last upon the sun, For there thou hast thy death. Tris. [Setting down the cup.] That needs no word. Pilot. Clear the anchor! Bring her to the wind! Strike sail! Sailors. Ay, ay, sir! [They lower the sail. The ship comes round. The rocky promontory disappears L. and Dundagil Castle appears on the backcloth R. Short symphony during which Tristram and Isolt remain gazing at one another. Tris. Can this be death, which fills my veins with fire, And chants within the chambers of my brain Forgotten songs of love? Isolt! Isolt! What hast thou done? Is. of I. I know not whatâblind work! We are the fools of fate! Tristram! Tris. Isolt! [They embrace passionately. Is. of I. Sink, world, away; this is the glorious dawn Of love's eternal morning! Honour and shame Are but grey ghosts, the minions of dead Time, And we, Time's outlaws, on a mightier stream Than sweeps down his vain tide customs and kings. Tris. Isolt, my bride, my queen! There is no law Can bind us now, save one, laid on us two By Love, the first and last and best of gods! Pilot. Let go the anchor! Sailors. Ay, ay, sir! [The anchor is let go. The ship gradually gets sternway on her until brought up by the cable. Distant trumpet heard. Tris. [Starting.] Yon trumpet breaks my dream, I must be gone! [Tearing himself from Isolt, he rushes on to the poop. Isolt reels backwards, sees Brangwaine and seizes her by the arm. Is. of I. Traitress! What drink was that? Bran. It was the love-drink! Blame your dark thought: in fear I changed the draughts. Is. of I. This is thy sin, not mine; thou shalt atone it. Bran. Oh, kill me not! Is. of I. Nay, thou shalt live to save me. Bran. Ah, how? What must I do? Is. of I. That thou shalt know; But first swear by the stone of Destiny That stands on Tara's hill; by heaven and hell, To do my bidding. Bran. Yet, before I swear, Tell me what dreadful thing I have to do. Is. of I. [Clutching her by the throat.] Swear! Swear! or by the rood I'll strangle thee; Tear thy false heart from that white breast of thine, Or hale thee by the hair to the ship's side, And fling thee to the sea! Swear! Swear, I say! Bran. I swear. Is. of I. By every oath! Bran. By every oath! Is. of I. [Releasing her.] Save me, Brangwaine! There is no second way. By thee I have become the thing I feared, His, his, body and soul, his brideâunwed. Be thou King Mark's. Bran. What would you have me do? Is. of I. But a light penance. Fill, in my place, the arms of Cornwall's king. We have one height, one mien, almost one shape, Complexion, Irish voice. Day barely knows Each from the other. Night's dull eye confounds us. Bran. This cannot save you from suspicious eye; My fault will come to light. Is. of I. What if it should? Bran. This were foul sin; show me some innocent way! Is. of I. Where all is foul the lesser foul is fair; Come, thou hast sworn. Bran. [Weeping.] I knew not what I swore! Is. of I. Yet thou didst swear! There is no other way. Tris. [From the poop.] No! clear the gangway! Guards ho! man the deck! The king comes! [Isolt and Brangwaine retire to the cabin. The gangway is opened, and the guards rank themselves on either side. Enter Tristram and Kurvenal bearing Tristram's shield and pennon. A loud flourish of trumpets is heard, and is answered from the poop. Go, Kurvenal, be herald to the queen Of the king's near approach. Kurvenal. [Goes to the door of the cabin.] Madam, the king! Re-enter Isolt and Brangwaine. Tris. [Aside.] Isolt, the world's upon us, full of eyes. [Isolt bows. The king's barge appears at the gangway, and while the bridge is being prepared for the king to come on board, the fool Melot skips over the bulwark and approaches Isolt and Brangwaine with quaint gestures and grimaces. Melot. My fair greeting to King Mark's queen! But by my cockscomb I have two minds in me which of you to choose for my mistress; for one of you is as like the other as two swans on a lake! Is. of I. What misshapen piece of God's handiwork art thou? Melot. [Strutting about.] The king, madam. Is. of I. Or the king's fool? Melot. Say the king's king, lady; for when the king's a fool, the fool is king. Tris. Begone, fool! [As Tristram raises his hand to strike the fool, he ducks with a shriek of laughter, and runs up the steps to the poop on the front of which he sits with his feet dangling over the deck. Enter King Mark from his barge, leaning on Mariodoc, two pages bearing his train. Soldiers and Sailors. Hail to King Mark! [A flourish of trumpets. As Tristram leads Isolt forward to meet King Mark, the curtain falls. End of Prologue</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Scene I A great hall in King Mark's castle. Low vaulted ceiling, roof supported on thick columns, with Celtic capitals formed of grotesque heads with quaintly interlaced beards, intertwined monsters, etc. In the middle of the R. wall an arched doorway leading to Isolt's apartments. In the L. wall, more towards the back of the stage, three great arches open upon a corridor. Between the springing of the R. and middle arch is an image of St. Germain of Cornwall, a hanging-lamp burning before it. Over the central arch hangs the banner of King Mark (a white horse argent upon a crimson ground). Over the door of Isolt's apartments, the banner of Ireland (a golden sunburst on a dark blue ground); over the door to the apartments of Isolt of Brittany, Tristram's banner (a golden lion rampant on a green ground). All the entrances are hung with rich curtains embroidered with Celtic patterns. On a dais against the wall, L., are two chairs of state with the arms of King Mark emblazoned on a shield on the wall above them. Time: Afternoon Three knights, Sir Utred, Sir Hoel and Sir Hugh, discovered standing by the dais, on the steps of which Melot sits, cracking and eating nuts. Enter from the back, Mariodoc. Mario. Well, sirs, what do you think now of this dotage of King Mark? Utred. We have seen it with amazement. Mario. This Irish witch plays with him as if he were her hooded falcon. Hugh. And Tristram, they say, wears her like a glove on his hand. Mario. Oh, he is still the king's proxy! Hoel. But are these rumours true? [Melot cracks a nut and laughs. Mario. Trust the fool to pick the kernel out of the nut. Melot. [Throwing away a nut.] This should be the King Mark of nuts. 'Tis a blind one! Mario. You see how Tristram flatters his uncle, fawning the hand that slew his fatherâif old tales be true Hoel. If he held the king guilty of his father's death, he would have avenged it openly. There is no baseness in his nature. But who heeds this old wives' gossip? Mario. Oh gossip is the crude gold of truth, which the, monks alloy in their chronicles! Hoel. If Tristram be in fault, as you say, it is some strange love-madness has fallen upon him. Mario. Love is but a toy! Can he still believe the monkish story of his father's death? Do you think he plots no revenge, dreams no ambitious dreams? Hoel. He lives in fantasy, and plots nothing. Hugh. Yet he may be dangerous. There is wild blood in him. His father was an unbaptised heathen when the monks came in with King Mark, and the Druid gods fled before the blessed Cross. Hoel. Well, sirs, it is you who brand King Mark with the mark of Cainânot Sir Tristram. Mario. Oh, sir, I hold King Mark fully justified in anything he may have done in the cause of true religion, though he had slain a score of brothers, Christian or Pagan. He stands assoiled of our Holy Church, and we pledged to guard his saintly head from treachery. Well, we have had a month of wanton revelry over these two marriages, King Mark's and Tristram's. Hugh. But now the honeymoon begins to wane. Mario. Ay, if the king were as tired of Isolt of Ireland as Tristram is of Isolt of Brittany. What should a man do who sees his sister so neglectedâhis king so betrayed? Utred. Put a sword in his tongue, and a tongue in his sword. Hoel. Can he so deceive the king, and so abuse your sister? Tristram! Mario. Why not, man? There is nothing so bad it cannot be done in this world of unchastened flesh. Tristram? This vainglorious maker of love-songs loves Isolt, my sister, merely by the bond; Isolt the queen, par amour! But my sister shall be avenged, and myself, too. I am as near in blood to the king as this upstartâand his elder in arms to boot. [To Melot.] And now, my little cock-sparrow, what news of that Irish sweetheart of thine? Melot. If no news be good news, it will not be so bad. It is no news that Enna is the queen's woman, therefore a woman, whoever makes an offer for her. It is no news that you are a bigger fool than me; for you would send a fool to woo a woman with two empty hands. [Holds up his hands.] She may come peeping here, to spy if the coast be clear for her mistress, before you have time to grow much wiser. Mario. [Giving him a necklace and armlet of pearls.] Shut thy fist on these. Melot. Aha! The first pearls of wisdom you ever let fall when I was by! [Trumpet heard. Mario. The king's trumpet! [Mariodoc and knights move up stage and are about to go out, when Melot sees Isolt of Brittany, who appears at the door of her apartment, R. Melot. [Plucking Mariodoc by the sleeve.] Here comes your sister, with salt water in her eyes. [Mariodoc makes a sign to knights, who bow and exeunt at back. Melot skips up to Isolt of Brittany. Melot. Fair princess, I kiss your white hands! How does your noble husband, Sir Tristram? There is a fear on me that though a married man, he would be still a knight-errant. Is. of B. Begone, fool! I am in no jesting mood. [She sighs. [Exit Melot. Mario. [As she approaches him.] A month's bride, and more full of sighs than a week's widow. It meansâ what? Is. of B. I cannot tell. Mario. Tristram neglects you? Is. of B. He is always gentle and courteousâyetâ Mario. He loves you not too well? Is. of B. HeâI know not what to think. Mario. Think that your man has roving eyes. Is. of B. Roving eyes? Mario. Ay, and a roving heart behind them. There is more than one Isolt in the world. Is. of B. No, noânot that! I'll not believe it! [Flourish of trumpets heard. Mario. The king comes. If Tristram be in his train, speak to him. Bid him take you from the court. Is. of B. Oh, if he would! Mario. I will draw the king away. Retire and watch. [Exit Isolt of Brittany, L. Enter from the corridor, King Mark, Tristram, king's page, knights and attendants. King M. [To page.] Say to the queen that I would speak with her. [Exit page, R. Tristram, I owe thee debts whose mounting sum Only my love can pay; and this thou hast. In blood almost my son, thou art to me More than to many a father many a son, For thy desert is more; and those broad lands Of Lyonesse, which I have given thee now With my fair niece, Isolt of Brittany, Count but thy patrimony. Tris. Oh, my dear uncle, Your gracious goodness far outpays my worth! King M. Pay but thy worth, and all I have were thine! For thou hast given me youth, youth in the heart And youth's bold fires renewed in every vein. Tris. If I bear fruit, I am but a fruitful tree Set in your orchard, yours with its increase. Re-enter page with Brangwaine. King M. What now, Brangwaine? Bran. The queen, my lord, entreats you To pardon her a while. King M. Why tarries she? Bran. [Smiling.] To-day, Sir King, we find her hard to please, Her tire-women have used their utmost art; Yet naught contents her. Thrice within this hour She has changed her robes and jewelsâall's amiss. King M. [Good-humouredly.] Then when she comes she should abash the sun. Bran. She bids me say that when you take the air Upon the bastion, she will wait you. King M. She shall be warned. Let her not fail me then. [Exit Brangwaine R. [King moves down stage followed by Mariodoc and knights. Tristram remains in the background absorbed in thought. King M. Well, sirs, how looks it for our sport to-night? Utred. O'er the sunk sun the clouds in lurid glow, Menace a tempest from the Irish Sea. Hoel. The fishermen come scudding from the banks, Following the sea-fowl, that with inland scream Whiten the coast with wings, lured by the herring. Mario. Till the moon change the tempest holds aloof. What if a capful gather in the clouds, Enough to wrestle with the murmuring boughs And scatter dancing moonlight thro' the woods? King M. Our horns shall blow, then. All assemble here. What, Tristram, sad? Turning to him. Tris. [Still in the backgroundâstarting.) My lord, like the sweet fall Of a remembered tune, the gentle thought Of your most royal bounty wakes in me That sadness which still haunts the soul of joy. King M. I know the tune of thy most loyal heart. Mario. He is but a harp for brooding fantasy To sweep with wandering fingers into song. Humour his mood, my lord. King M. In happy time! Tristram, we leave thee to thy mystery. Tris. With your good leave, my lord. [Bows to king. [Exeunt king, Mariodoc, knights and attendants. [Tristram stands before Isolt of Ireland's apartment R., then turns away with a sigh and seats himself in one of the chairs on the dais, L. Isolt of Brittany appears at the door L. and watches him while he remains in thought. Then she comes timidly forward a few steps and speaks. Is. of B. Tristram! dear lord! Tris. [Shuddering.] What are thou? Is. of B. Thy Isolt! Tris. [Without looking at her, his head supported on his hand.] Isolt? 'Tis a sweet name. Is. of B. [Coming round and facing him.] It is my name. Tris. [Looking up.] Will the king hold his purpose for to-night? Will he go hunting? Is. of B. That should'st thou know best. But wherefore? Tris. [Rising.] Wherefore? I would hunt with him. [He comes down from the dais and paces restlessly. I love a noble burst under the moon, When I sit horsed upon a dream, and hear The hounds, far off, bay through the steaming woods. NayâI am sick of hunting, sick of dreams; Would there were wars, new wars! Is. of B. That would not I. Dost thou not love me, Tristram? Tris. Ay, by the bond That makes us one, I love theeâas myself! Is. of B. Why am I then killed with cold looks? Tris. Why? why? That is the world's one everlasting wail, It sighs in every wind, and the vext sea Speaks it in thunder. Why? Silence itself Is vocal in that never-answered word. [He stands still and listens. Hark, how the sea-fowl scream about this tower! There will be storm at changing of the moon. Is. of B. [Laying her hand on his arm.] O, Tristram, thou dost love me! Must I beg Even for the crumbs of love's own daily bread? Tris. Why shouldst thou beg? Women should grant, not beg. [Looking sadly at her. A woman's love! What is a woman's love That it should make men traitors to themselves? [He gently disengages himself, and again paces to and fro. Is. of B. Is this my Tristram of the pleading harp? Tris. Time is too short with his revealing hours To bare the mysteries of our mortal clay. What women be I know not; but I know Each man is double. Thinkest thou I am Tristram? Poor child, thou art deceived! I am not he. Where is thy lord? Go seek him in thy chamber! Is. of B. My chamber? Tris. Ay, let him not find me here. [Looks round him with increasing agitation. That other Tristram frights me. Is. of B. Oh, what means this? Tris. It is a warning of near death, when men See their own spectres. There! He comes again! With my own face he sternly looks on me! Speak to me! Call me traitor! [To Isolt of Brittany. Dost thou not mark How his rebuking eyes abash me? Go! He becks thee from meâgo! Is. of B. Nay, I see nothing. Is this but madness feigned to put me by? Tris. Ask me not what it isâlet me get hence! [As Tristram is about to go out at back, re-enter Mariodoc, meeting him. Mario. A word with you, Sir Tristram of Lyonesse! [Tristram impatiently pushes past him and exit. Oho! Sir King that is to be; but we are not king yet! [Mariodoc comes forward observing Isolt of Brittany who stands in dumb amazement. Mario. Well, sister, what of your suit? Is. of B. Oh, do not ask me! [She grows faint, Mariodoc leads her to the door of her apartments and speaks as she goes off. Mario. Something's amiss; but it shall be righted. [As he comes back Melot skips in from the corridor. Melot. Hide, hide, if you would see sport! She will come now. [He drags Mariodoc into the corridor, and they hide behind the curtains. Enter from Isolt of Ireland's apartments, R., Enna. As she looks cautiously round Melot runs up to her; Mariodoc remaining, observes them from the back. Melot. My thousand welcomes to you, my Irish daisy! Enna. [Starting with a scream.] Oh, you ugly little scorpion! What is it you want with me? Melot. It is your love I want, thief of my heart! Your love! Enna. It is the white wish of my heart you may be hanged! Melot. Hang me first, so you will love me after. But it is yourself is the gallows I would like to be hanging on for ever! [He winds a long plait of her hair round his neck and looks up at her with mocking entreaty.] Have pity, beauty of the world! Have pity! [Enna struggles to free herself, and he kneels, clutching at her skirts. Melot. You have taken the heart from my breast, and left a stone in the place where it was. [Pretends to weep. Enna. Leave me go, you foul goblin! [Melot rises and looks at her with threatening grimaces, then takes his bauble and draws a circle round her on the ground. Melot. Oh, go! If it is leaving me you would be. But out of that magic circle you'll never stir till I say Almodoth! See how it flames! Enna. [Terrified.] Flames? Oh, you have put sorcery on me! Melot. Oho! Will you be cruel still? [Grimaces.] Well, I have been cruel in my day. [Struts round her.] Many's the fair woman I have betrayed. It is the gay goblin I have been. Enna. [Laughing hysterically.] Where was the woman could love a misshapen thing like that? [Points at him. Melot. [With a touch of real feeling.] Take your finger from me! The more should be your pity for my misfortune, you swan of the sweet music! Faggots and fire were my mother's gossips when I came into this bad world. But what's that to you or me? [Laughs bitterly.] Will you dare to scoff at Creation's master-piece? [Struts and leers.] Am not I a man? Enna. Ay, if a man would happen to get made in the Devil's image. Melot. [Seizing her hands.] It is an enchanted prince I am, charmed in this ugly shape by a Druid's curse. Kiss me thrice, and you shall see me transformed. [He pinches her arm. She screams. Kiss me, Beauty of the World, and I'll let you go. [She bends to touch his forehead with her lips; but he draws her head down and kisses her on the mouth. Enna. Ugh! Melot. The first kiss! The other two may wait. I wouldn't give the scraping of a trencher for a woman's love; but do my bidding, and you shall haveâ Enna. What? Melot. Stoop the rosy shell of that little ear to my mouth. Enna. Is it bite me you would? Melot. Noânot even kiss you, on the honour of a king! [She bends down. You shall haveâTristram's love. Enna. [Startled.] Sir Tristram's? Melot. Oh, I can read your thoughts, my hidden flower of the woods! But first it is that proud witch, Isolt, we must put out of your road for you. Enna. My mistress? Melot. She is a crow to a swan when you are in the one place with her. But 'tis black the swan will be getting that consorts with crows. [With solemnity.] If you hate sin, give me a clue that will lead the king to find out falsehoodâand you shall have all that women desire. Enna. Oh, you imp of the devil! Let me go, out of this! Melot. Oh, you lost angel! Stay and be tempted back to grace! [Showing the pearls.] You shall have these. Enna. I would not sell my mistress forâfor anything you would offer me. [Exit Mariodoc behind, laughing. Melot. Sell? Small fear I have you would do that. But will you see a noble king betrayed, and you eating his bread? And you holding the tongue you say your prayers with, and helping her to deceive him? Enna. I am in two minds what to do. Melot. Do rightâwalk in the path of virtue, and you will find it your path to fortune. Here are the first drops of the shower of good luck that is over you. [Clasps the armlet on her arm.] Look how well they become that white armâand this, my swan of the white neck!âthis [shaking the necklace before her] âthis for proof ofâyou know what. Enna. Wellâto none but the king will I tell it. Melot. To the king, thenâto the king! [Waves his bauble.] Almodoth! You are free! Go and tell her the coast is clear! [He makes her a mocking bow as she steps out of the circle and exit R. Melot. I must wipe the silly magpie's kiss from my lips for fear it would corrupt my virtue. [Wipes his lips with his cuff. Enter R., Isolt of Ireland and Brangwaine. Melot dances before them with ape-like grins and gestures, then exit at back. Is. of I. This elvish dwarf had malice in his face, His eyes are death's cold beacons. Bran. You sport with danger Using the king with such a frank disdain. Is. of I. I have no skill in feigning, and grow sick Of breathing sleek hypocrisy for air. O God! I must break forth or die! Bran. Fly then! While time holds back the blabbing hourâfly now! Is. of I. Perhaps?âThe king suspects me, does he not? Bran. And with good cause, madam. Is. of I. How now, Brangwaine? What ails thee? Bran. Oh, I cannot bear it longer, Would I had died, ere sworn myself your slave, To practise treason the most damnable! Is. of I. Worse didst thou do to me, changing the draughts. 'Tis but soft penance I have laid on thee; For the grey king has found my proxy fair! Thou hast a woman's craft to play for power, And art half amorous of the greybeard's fame: Play well, thou winn'st a crown. Bran. I would not win With such a crime the crown of all the worldâ Feel myself such a wanton! Is. of I. [Kissing her.] Thou art none. There is no wanton, save the bride who loathes To yield herself, yet yields. Bran. My sin's as foul! Is. of I. Not thine the fault, nor mine. His, his, 'tis his Sin against youth and love. Think what foul wrong This dotard does me, binding my young lifeâ Bran. Dotard? I tell you were ten thousand Tristrams Laid in one scale, the king but touched its brother, His worth would make them but a feather's weight. Is. of I. Ha! Thou dost love this king? Bran. That love redeems me. You have torn my secret bleeding from my heart. Would I could tear that heart out of my breast To lay in expiation at his feet! Is. of I. Pay with my blood, not thine! I might have seenâ The more fool Iâa woman trust a woman! Bran. I never wronged you, nor will wrong you now, Though sick with fear I play your desperate game. Is. of I. Forgive me then, I'll trust theeâone bold stroke Even now may set us free. [Tristram's harp is heard preluding. 'Tis Tristram's harp. It speaks in sad accords. Go, bring him here! Say I must speak with him. [Exit Brangwaine. He comes as though the longing of my heart Thrilled all the air with its one ceaseless cry: âI want thee; come to me!â Re-enter Brangwaine with Tristram and page. Tris. Take my harp, boy; wait in the corridor. [The page takes the harp and exit into the corridor. Isolt motions to Brangwaine. She retires R. and watches. Isolt! I live once more. Is. of I. Oh, my life's lord! My breast is earth waiting the touch of spring; Comfort its cold, for I am sick with longing. But now, no time for solace of sweet words, Each moment is a traitor. Oh, my love, We must fly, fly to-night! Tris. To-night? 'Tis sudden. Is. of I. It must be dared. Tris. I was o'er-ruled by thee, When in our first glad hour under green boughs I whispered: We must fly! Is. of I. I was a fool, Ten times a fool, to bid thee wed that woman. Tris. Why didst thou? Is. of I. Oh, thought of thy coming years Made me in this too hard against myself! I was too weak. These long, long days I have raged A jealous woman, jealous, Tristram, jealous! Tris. Thou hast no cause. O for a word of flame That should outlive the stars, to speak my love! Is. of I. The sun is back in heaven. But hark! Tristram, I doubt Brangwaine. Tris. Brangwaine? Is. of I. She loves the king. Tris. We should have feared this. We must fly. Is. of I. To-night. May it be done? Tris. [Calling the page.] Here, boy! It may be done. [The page enters. Tristram gives him his dagger. Off like an arrow! This to Kurvenal, And wait me at the fountain by the wood With what he gives thee. [The page about to go. Stay! Hast thou, Isolt, One woman thou canst trust? Is. of I. Enna, my maid; A simple thing that came o'erseas with me. Tris. Then at the fountain let her meet my page. Is. of I. [Calls.] Enna! [Enna comes. Isolt speaks to her aside. Tris. [To page.] Give her the token sent by Kurvenal. Page. I will, my lord. [Enna bows and withdraws. Tris. Off, then, wings at thy heels! [Exit page, L. Is. of I. What signifies this dagger message? Tris. âDanger!â This month, by Kurvenal's hut in the woods Swift horses in their stalls stand day and night, And in a lone cove of the southern coast, Manned and in trim for sea my warship waits. Is. of I. O bravely done! And I? What is my part? Tris. The king will hunt to-night. Keep thou thy chamber Till the loud horns grow faint in the far woods, Then steal to Kurvenal's hut. I'll meet thee there, And then to sea, for love and liberty! Is. of I. The sea! O listen, Tristram, how it calls us! The waves grow wild, seeking us on the shore, And the wind whistles, eager for our sail. I'll trust no soul, but go alone. Tris. So best. Is. of I. But for the token sent by Kurvenal? Tris. If all be well, two aspens twined in one, Their heart-shaped leaves like lover's trembling hearts. Is. of I. Our old sweet pledge of secret meeting! [Laying her hand on his shoulder.] Tristram, Can all the future hold diviner bliss Than those brief hours that wereâso long ago? Tris. Has Love no word but one, or that one word May he not speak it in a thousand tones? Death steals into the heart when passion cloys. Is. of I. A great word, death; familiar to my soul As love's most inward songâ [Draws phial from her bosom. See, Tristram, here I keep that love-drink we have drained not yet. Tris. There are fresh fields to walk in ere that day. Life on the budding moment richly lives; Let us not sicken o'er to-morrow's fruit. [Isolt returns the phial to her breast. Is. of I. To-dayâto-night! What is the sign of danger? Tris. A dead branch. [Trumpet heard. Bran. [Coming down stage.] The king's trumpet! [Exit R. Tris. We must part! Is. of I. 'Till night, then nevermore perchance. Tris. Farewell! Is. of I. Farewell! I shall be sick and sick indeed, Until I kiss my ease in those green hearts. And then into the air, Tristram, with thee, Out, out, into the air, freedom and love! Tris. Good speed! Is. of I. Farewell! [Exit Tristram behind. [Re-enter Brangwaine with Isolt's ladies in waiting. As she places a splendid mantle on Isolt's shoulders she says in a low voice. Bran. Rememberâyou may trust me! Curtain End of Act I</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene I. The Great Hall (as in Act I) Time: Evening; torches in sconces on the walls are lit. Knights, ladies and courtiers discovered awaiting the king's entrance. Three knights of Mariodoc's party stand together near footlights, R. Enter from the back Mariodoc and Melot, laughing. They come down stage to where the three knights are standing. Mario. [To knights.] Tristram to be the king's heir, if he should have no son! How do you like that? Knights. Not at all. Mario. Give me your hands, then, and Tristram shall go down. [To Melot.] Out with thy news, changeling! Melot. Crown me king of all fools; for the fear is on me I may be catching the plague of love. But the maid is ours, and I am not half as much married as my uncle Mark or my cousin Tristramâas yet. Mario. [Laughing.] Oh, you should have seen this goblin wooing. The Devil making love to Eve in the bishop's miracle-play was but a blind worm to this little snake. Well, I have sown the seeds of suspicion in the king's mind; yet they do not thriveâ the soil is so rankly overgrown with folly's weeds. But now we shall have proof, if the world last another night. Hoel. You are certain? Mario. Enough to convince a saint. But he will hear no truth from me. You must lead the onset, and I'll spring the ambush. Utred. I will broach it to the king, myselfâif you do not. [Flourish of trumpets. Enter King Mark and Tristram attended. Melot stands whispering to Mariodoc. King M. 'Tis such a perfect night as well might shame Even sluggards from their beds. Is it not, sirs? Mario. Perfect, Sir King, for woodcraft. [The king seats himself on dais. King M. How swift the clouds Drive past the sailing moon! I love to hear The hounds' bold music in the sighing woods On such a night. Now, Tristram, thou and I Will try our final match of gallant craft. Tris. You are two points ahead, my lord. King M. Three, three! I promise thee that if thou winest of me 'Twill prove a feat of labour. Come, confess I am as young a fellow for my years As thou for thine. Tris. Younger, my lord, in heart. King M. In this I fear thou art a courtier, Tristram. Will the queen hunt to-night? Why comes she not? Bran, her great hound, is brother to the winds; We cannot breed such dogs in Cornwall here. Why comes she not? Tris. My lord, I cannot tell. Enter Brangwaine from Isolt's chamber, bearing the king's cup. She stands before the king below the dais. The knights whisper furtively and smile. King M. 'Tis but Brangwaine. Comes not the queen, Brangwaine? Bran. The queen is sick, my lord, and keeps her chamber; But with her duteous homage sends this cup. King M. By heaven, I'll take it from no hand but hers! Pardon this heat; the deputy is fair: None fairer or more worthy, if in sooth It must be so. Bran. It were, my lord, I know, An honour to my loyalty and love, Too far beyond my merit, thus to serve you. King M. Tristram, go thou; say I await the queen To send me to the saddle blithe of cheer. If she be sick indeed, I will not ride. [Exit Tristram, R. King M. Brangwaine! [He beckons to herâshe ascends the dais and they converse apart. Bran. My lord? King M. If rightly in thine eyes I read thy heart, I have one faithful friend. Bran. Oh, my dear lord! King M. I am sore perplext, Brangwaine. With such base whispers in the air, the queen Should for no petty cause give envious tongues Such theme to wag upon. I have grown grey in wars, am nothing skilled In women and their ways; and yet, believe me, In the white sanctuary of a pure heart Have knelt to womanhood, as the Holy Grail That holds the world's redemption. But now, now, These scurrile whispers wake some doubt in me. Bran. Of what, my lord? King M. What should thy innocence know Of thoughts like these? What mystery's here, Brangwaine? Enter Tristram, Isolt of Ireland and Enna. Isolt whispers to Enna, who goes out at back. As she passes Melot, he shows her the necklace, with a meaning glance. Bran. The queen, my lord! King M. [To Brangwaine.] I'll talk with thee again. Isolt, I thank thee for this courtesy Though it be somewhat tardy. Is. of I. [Seating herself languidly.] Oh, my lord, I crave your pardon that I am not well. [Melot laughs and slips out behind. King M. That needs no pardon. Think me not unkind That I have asked thee for one gracious glance Of thy sweet eyes. If thou be sick indeed I would not rob thee of one moment's rest. Is. of I. My lord, I am your handmaid. King M. Nay, my love, Thou art my queen; not in mere outward state, But in the cloistered stillness of my soul Where every lovely and most loyal thought Is thy perpetual homage. Is. of I. My lord, I pray you spare me from your train to-night; My present languor would but mar your sport. King M. Be free in this, as in all else that's honest. But thou art pale. I fear thou art not well. Is. of I. 'Tis nothingâit will pass. But I am here To be your cupbearer. [Takes the cup from Brangwaine, and the king and she stand up. Health to the king! [She sets the cup to her lips. Good luck, good sport, and prosperous return! [She hands the cup to the king. King M. To thee, Isolt! [He drinks. O, my sweet wife, my heart is in that pledge! Our sport will lack its choicest of delight, Lacking thy presence. Is. of I. I am sorry, sir, To vex you; but I pray you give me leaveâ [He hands her down from the dais. King M. Since it must be, good-night, and healing sleep Wait on thy pillow! [He kisses her. Is. of I. You are kind, my lord. Good-night! [Exeunt Isolt of Ireland and Brangwaine. Tristram accompanies them to the door of Isolt's apartments and then returns. Enter a herald, who approaches the king and kneels to him. Herald. My lord, two Knights of King Arthur's Table, Sir Brian and Sir Bors, bring you gentle greeting from their lord, King Arthur, on the occasion of your marriage, with many precious wedding gifts. King M. My brother Arthur! My most gracious lord! This is a happy omen. Bid them welcome! Let them be feasted well. Thanks for thy news. [Herald rises, bows to the king and exit. King M. Go, Tristram, greet for me these noble knights; Give them great thanks; see them well entertained. Anon I'll come in person to the board, And pledge them in a spicy loving-cup. [To the courtiers.] Attend Sir Tristram! [Tristram bows and exit, attended by the courtiers. [Mariodoc and his party linger in the background as King Mark comes down stage. Enter Melot, who converses with Mariodoc. Mariodoc then nods to Sir Utred, who approaches the king. King M. [Aside.] This sickness of the queen! How like a cloud It hangs o'er all the house and o'er my spirit! Utred. My lord! King M. What, what? Utred. I am very loath, Sir King, To break upon your hour of merriment; But duty, and the love I bear your person Make longer silence merely treachery. King M. Speak out, Sir Knight, and quickly, as thou lov'st me. Utred. Give me a gracious hearing, then, my liege, For your own honour's sake. King M. What of my honour? Utred. In plain words, you are much deceived, my lord, By those you hold most dear. King M. I have heard such things From currish tongues; but from a loyal knightâ Make good thy word, or I am bound to hold thee But a base recreant and a slanderer. Utred. You have heard truth, my lord. You hear it now, I dare maintain it. King M. Scandal grown so bold! This must be sounded to the very mire. Sir Mariodoc! Mario. My lord? King M. Hast thou set on This knight of my own train toâOh, 'tis foul If envy, brooding o'er its base conceits, Spit its own spleen to blacken innocence! Mario. Your knights, as I, in loyalty and love Would have the king to know what most concerns him, And what all know save one, the king himself! Sir Tristram loves the queen, the queen, Sir Tristram! King M. What! All know this? Speak you, and you! Hoel. My lord, This I have heard, and I believe 'tis true. Hugh. It is the common talk! King M. The common talk? The common scandal! [Aside to Mariodoc.] Yet it well might beâ Her beauty? O, what may not beauty do, To drive a young man mad! But she, my wifeâ Young, young, and ripe, warm, amorous flesh and blood; And I am old. Mario. My lord, is there no whisper in your mind That secretly chimes with the common tongue? No memory of a tone, a sigh, a look, That may give challenge to your dauntless trust? King M. She should have hated Tristram, as I deemed Blood-feud between them. Mario. Yet she hates not him. King M. [To Mario.] This have I seen loom in the vague of thought, Marvelled, and let it sail aloof. I have been Too trustful, given temptation a free walk. This fault was mine. [Sadly.] Well, sirs, I thank you all For timely warning. Tristram shall go hence, Home with his bride, beforeâ'tis not too late? Mario. It is too late, Sir King. King M. I'll not believe it. [Mariodoc makes a sign to Melot who goes out and presently returns with Enna. Men may be tempted sorely, yet not sin, Being in graceâ'Tis malice in your eyes Makes you see the full-blown flower of sin In the close bud, perchance not even the bud. Mario. Our malice is but faithful love to you. I here impeach Sir Tristram as a traitor. Ay, King; and dare avouch it in his teeth If such need were. King M. Proof, proof! Give me some proof, Or, by the holy oil of mine anointing, Thy head shall pay the slander! If this be true, Death! aim thy swiftest arrow at my breast! Mario. You shall have proof, my lord. [He motions to Melot, who brings Enna, who wears the necklace, forward. King M. [To Mario.] Tristram! I read no falsehood in his face When he was here but now. And she, she, she, Can sin so black inhabit form so fair? [Seeing Enna. The queen's own woman! Well, what is thy tale? Enna. No tale that I will be long telling, my lord. Thisâ[showing the aspen twigs]âwas given me by Sir Tristram's page. King M. And the meaning, the meaning? Enna. The token of the green heartsâthat they will be meeting to-night. King M. Meeting? Who? Enna. Sir Tristram and the queen. King M. For the first time? Enna. No, nor the second either, my lord, by the hand of my truth! [Holds up her hand. King M. The worst, tell me the worst. Have they metâoften? Enna. Often, my lord! King M. Met oftenâwhen? Where? Enna. At nightâin the queen's chamber. King M. [Aside to Mariodoc.] The queen steal from my side. That could not be! Unlessâthere are enchantments that may make The senses specious liars, cheat the brain To give a body to its bodiless thoughts. She comes of Druid race. [Aloud to Enna. If thou be perjured, wench, the fiery stake Were scant requital for so torturing me. Enna. It is the white truth, great king, I am telling you. King M. Where do they meet? Enna. In the queen's chamber; but to-night, my lord, I think They will be planning to go from you. King M. I will not hunt to-night. Mario. My lord, are you yet convinced? King M. Not yet, not yet. Mario. Then, my lord, I most earnestly beseech you, let the hunting go forward. Send this girl to her mistress with the token in her hand; and if I give you not full proof of their guilt ere dawn, take my head. King M. This must I do, or live upon the rack. Thou wretched go-between, offâdo thy task! If what thou sayest be false, by heaven, I'll have thee First strangled and then burnt; if thou speak'st true I will enrich thee with a marriage-portion, That thou mayest fool some husband. Get thee gone! Melot. [To Enna, as she goes out.] Get but this portion, and I'll have thee; and take a husband's chance of being fooled. [Exit Enna. Mario. My lord, your noble guests await you. 'Twere well You strove to meet them with a smiling face. King M. Sir Knight, a king can bear him like a king. End of Scene I Scene II A glade in the woods. Kurvenal's hut, L., a great stag's antlers fixed over the door. Before it is an open space with heather in bloom. From the door a path leads through the heather into the wood at the back of the stage R. R. C., under tall bracken which stretches away into the woods beyond, lies a felled oak-log, and behind it in the bracken stand some young oak-trees. Another path from the door of the hut passes in front of the felled tree, and leads out into the woods R. The backcloth shows an oak-wood with undergrowth of bracken and holly. It is early autumn, the bracken is just beginning to turn. Moonlight from R. illumines the front of the stage and Kurvenal's hut, the back and R. of the stage being in shadow. A high wind is heard in the trees. Enter from the hut, Kurvenal. He looks anxiously round and sees Caradoc who enters R. upper entrance. Kur. Ho, Caradoc! Cara. It will be just me. Kur. The horses are saddled these two hours or more; and yet they do not come. What a night! Cara. And it will be wilder yet, for the autumn gales are upon us. [Horns heard in the distance. Kur. There goes the hunt. Will they pass this way? [Listens. Cara. May be ay, may be no. [After a pause the horns are heard more faintly. Kur. No, they are taking the way by the wolf's glen. Well, this is a mad business. How's the sea? Cara. O, ay, the seaâI was justâ [He slowly sits down on the log R. C. Kur. [Listens again.] Hark! someone comes. [Goes up stage with his sword drawn. Enter Tristram from behind the hut. Sir Tristram! Tris. Ho, Kurvenal! Has she come? Kur. Not yet. [They gradually come down stage as they talk. Tris. Not here? It grows late and time presses. Where is my page? Kur. At watch in the woods. Did you think to go aboard to-night? Tris. Aboard? To sea, to sea! Kur. Then the Lord have mercy on our souls! If we needs must go to sea, let us take our swords in our teeth, and swim for it at once. Tris. Is it so bad? [Caradoc approaches Kur. Here comes our old sea-dog. Ask him what he has seen. Tris. Well, friend, what news? How looks the sea? Cara. [Taking off his red cap and fumbling with it as he speaks.] Oh, the sea! I was just coming from our skipper to tell your honour how it looks. Oh, master, but it looks bad enoughâbad enough it looks. Oh ay! Tris. What, there's a sea on? Cara. A sea, master? Oh, ay, there's a sea on to frighten a mermaid or a bull seal. Kur. What did I tell you? Tris. [Makes an impatient gesture.] And the ship, the ship? Cara. Oh ay, the shipâthat's what I came to tell your honour. She began to drag her anchors, and the skipper he ran her ashore and beached her. Tris. The ship ashore! No putting to sea to-night, then, with treble pay for all hands? Cara. Put to sea is it? A right whale could get no offing such a night as this. No, nor for a week's time if this blows its bellyful. There are things crying in this gale, bless you, thatâOh, ay! Tris. What things? Cara. Drownded souls, maybe, or maybe worser things. Voices and prophesyings they have, for the ears that can hear them. Tris. Where are the men? Cara. Safely housed, master, in the boat-house, asleep or spinning yarns over a driftwood fire. There are things to be seen in a fire of wreck timber, master, eerie thingsâoh, ay! I saw a bloody sword in the flames to-night. Kur. Well, I have seen many a bloody sword in my day; but not in a driftwood fire. Tris. [To Cara.] Go forage in the hut for some food, and a draught of good mead. Cara. [Aside to Kurvenal, as he goes to the hut.] The shroud at his breast already. It mounts apace, oh, ay! [Exit into the hut. Tris. How the lone moon fights with the scudding rack! 'Tis a wild night; the wind leagued with the sea, The sea with the rude rocks, and all with fate. Kur. Where did you leave the hunt? [The moon is obscured. Tris. In the Wolf's Glen. This gathering darkness chills like heaven's own frown. Not come! What subtle treachery of the woods Stays her entangled feet? The wings of night Beat slow with leaden languor, like the pulse Of a man dying, every weary throb Counted upon my heart. What unseen eye Is fixed on me with furtive malison? Kur. No more sick fancies! I'll go watch. [He retires up-stage, looks round and again comes down. The queen! Enter by the path R., Isolt of Ireland. As she approaches Tristram, the moon shines out. Tris. Isolt! At last! [Kurvenal retires and keeps watch. Is. of I. O night, sweet secret night, Seal treachery's eyes! [They embrace passionately. Free, free, and in thine arms! Tris. Thou dost renew the world, and budding spring Invades again sere autumn's fated realm. Yon trees, that loomed but now like spectral foes Ambush'd in darkness, bend their guardian heads Through the enchanted gloom, where glows thy face, To keep love nested in sweet solitude. Is. of I. Come life, come death, I give myself to thee, My rest, my homeâsole haven of my heart! Tris. Come life, come death, I pledge myself thy love, Whelmed in the bliss of one adoring thought. Thou art the eternal bride my being claims. Is. of I. Thou art my life and I am lost in thee. Tris. Heart to heart, spirit to spirit, two mingling flames! Is. of I. One life, one love, one pulse, one ecstasy! [Symphony. [Tristram releasing herâthey move apart. A pause âIsolt looks round her. Is. of I. O blissful night! As through the woods I came, the forest balm Breathed to my quickened sense one splendid word, Liberty; life's full pulse stormed in my blood, I never lived before, ne'er loved before. Tris. O that this moment might stretch out long years, And we live on as now! It would fill time But to behold the rapture of thy face. Is. of I. I stood and listened to the chanting wind That bowed the trees, and searched me through and through Like the invasion of some glorious thought. I flung myself upon it, let my soul Be lifted as a leaf, and, borne away, Rest on its passion like a soaring bird. I seemed to wing winds, free as themselves. O Tristram take me, let me sail with thee Beyond the utmost reaches of the world. Away with thee, awayâsail evermore! Tris. The wildness of the winds is in thy words, My ocean child, and the salt ocean wind Has revelled in thy hair. The sea, the sea! There sounds the note of danger, which thy sight Had lulled to sleep with old forgotten things. Sit down awhile. [He leads her to fallen tree. Isolt, our destiny Hangs in time's murmuring loom, a web half woven, That in a moment may be ravelled up. Is. of I. [Half rising.] O, we must fly! 'Tis late, we must begone! Tris. [Restraining her.] Nay, sit and hear. We cannot sail to-night. Is. of I. Not sail! Tris. The wind's our jailer, and the rocks, The mad waves thunder on, our dungeon walls. But now a gaunt, grim-favoured mariner, Came to me, like a wraith out of the sea. Our ship's ashore. [A pause. Isolt sits brooding. Is. of I. The sea, the sea! Tristram, the sea's our fate. What must we do? Tris. Get presently to horse And push for Launcelot's hold. [Sheet-lightning begins to flash in the background. Isolt starts up. Is. of I. The lightning! See! Tris. The king's great angel draws his threatening swordâ That was the flash. Is. of I. No, no, it is my heart That fills all heaven with palpitating flame; Its own defiant lightnings are unsheathed For battle with the thunderbolts of doom. 'Tis but the pale reflection thou seest there. Tris. Thy blood made bold the Irish warrior-queens, Their haughty spirit lives again in thee. [Distant thunder heard. A vivid flash shows the face of Melot who peeps out from the tree-stems at the back, makes a gesture of triumph and retires. Is of I. Let us take horse, and through the gathering storm, Ride forth rejoicing. Tris. Ho, there! Kurvenal! To horse, to horse! [Distant horns heard. [Kurvenal comes down-stage. Kur. 'Tis the returning hunt. They make for home before the blinding storm. Let them go by. Here's safety for a while. Tris. That is good counsel. [He takes Isolt's head in his hands and gazes into her face. O my matchless one, That rapture of revolt is in thine eyes, Those glorious eyes, that might abash the stroke Of Death himself! Is. of I. My love! Pulse of my heart! I dare not think what thou hast lost for me! Tris. All's nothing, wanting thee. I would lose heaven For that new world I find within thine eyes. Is. of I. Tristram, dare we live on? Can love endure The changing seasons of our aftertime, And fear no winter? Tris. Oh, love lives in change, And every moment holds eternity, A babe re-born upon its passing breast. Is. of I. They say men die at turning of the tide. Comes there no hour at turning of Love's tide, When lovers ought to die? Tris. Let life make answer! [Tristram's page suddenly rushes in from back. Page. Sir Tristram, arm! The wood is full of men, Bowmen and spearmen in a deadly ring Close in on every hand. Tris. Ha! Treachery! Quick, Kurvenal, my casque and coat of mail! [Kurvenal runs to the hut. Is. of I. And arms for me! I'll be thy squire. Arms! arms! Tris. My warrior love! Break through? Perhapsâor die! [As Kurvenal brings Tristram's armour, Melot skips in laughing. Caradoc stands at the door. Melot. Faggots and fire for the witch! Faggots and fire! Kur. [Stabbing him.] That for thy currish tongue! Is. of I. Hold! [Melot falls with a shriek. Kur. He betrayed us! Melot. Curses upon thee, coward! O that I might live to seeâ [Isolt looks at him scornfully. Is. of I. Poor heap of malice, thou art paid too late! Melot. O pity me, lady pity me! I am but a poor fool âa childâa sick child. Hide my blood, I faint at the sight of it. [He dies. Kurvenal hands Tristram his helmet. He throws it down as the king enters, surrounded by Mariodoc and knights, with drawn swords. Tris. Too lateâthe king! Now is love's doomsday come. Is. of I. One kissâthe last! [They embrace hastily, then remain standing side by side. Mario. The proof, Sir King! [King Mark approaches sorrowfully and stands gazing silently at Tristram and Isolt of Ireland. I here proclaim thee, Tristram, A most foul traitor. [He goes up to Tristram who draws his sword. Yield thy recreant sword! Tris. To the king only. Back! I would not slay thee. [As Tristram lowers his sword, Mariodoc makes a hasty thrust at him, wounding him in the side. Tristram disarms him. Mariodoc retires leaving the sword where it fell. Is. of I. O Tristram, dost thou bleed? Tris. A scratch, no moreâ Dealt by a trembling hand. No hurt at all. King M. Here is my breast. Stab, Tristram! Aim that sword Which gave thee knighthood, at my heart. Let forth With its last desolate drops, the bitter grief Thy sin hath planted there. The stroke of steel Were but my ease, weapons can wound no more. Tris. My liege! my liege! [He surrenders his sword to the king, who takes it mechanically. King M. What word is native to the lips of men, Keen as an angel's falchion that can pierce The mail of sin that sheathes thee, prick to life Conscience, where yet perchance she sickly dwells. O Tristram, Tristram, what a fall is thine! Worse than man's first from Eden; yea, more like His, who betrayed his Master with a kiss. [Tristram remains silent with bowed head. Thy treachery poisons the sweet air of heaven, Makes life a wandering horror, and the earth A quagmire overgreened with rank deceits. I stand amazed at it. Is God a lie? Tris. I am a tree, by a resistless flood Uprooted and swept down! No man more true, Till Fate unsphered me with a mightier love! King M. Thou dost blaspheme the sacred name of love In such vile use. Is. of I. [With scorn.] How canst thou know that spirit, That wind, that fire, that hurrying destiny? King M. O thou unblushing shame, thou subtle plague, Painted so fair, sin hath a face like thine! Is. of I. Sin, sin! I had forgot that doleful wordâ That name, that spectral fear. Talk'st thou of sin? Sin follows sin, as wolf the wolf to prey, Thy own grey sin the leader of the pack. King M. Oh, thou hast made my heart a torturing cell, Where only groans inhabit. Murderess of love, Murderess of trust in man, and faith in God, Look on the wreck thy wantonness hath wrought! Is. of I. Count it but vengeance, vengeance for my land, And my own wrong. Thou won'st me as a slave, The slave will take the slave's way to be free. Tris. Enough of words. Uncle, the fault is mine, Yet, were all told, I never meant thee wrong. Is. of I. Tristram, thou didst me wrong. A man may give All to his friend, his goods, his hopes, his life, Not his own bride. But now we two must die. Tris. Mine is the sin, uncle! Now, as thou lovest me, Strike; let my blood cleanse my dishonoured sword. King M. My hand would honour thee in such a death, As when I struck thy knighthood on thy shoulder. It were no punishment for thy foul deed, If tempting rage moved me to smite thee now. [Tristram suddenly reels back and points to the sword used by Mariodoc. Tris. Isolt! What sword is that? [Mariodoc laughs. Is. of I. [Picking up the sword]. Morough's! [She flings it away. Fate, fate! Tris. The venomed blade has done its work anew. Its fire is in me! King, I demand my death; Let one atone for both! Oâwere all told! [He sinks on the ground. Isolt with a cry of despair throws herself down beside him, and takes his head on her lap. The king sheathes his sword and stands over him. King M. Be banished to thy lands in Brittany; And if thou livest, yield thee to my mercy. [Tristram faints. The spectators close around as the curtain falls quickly. Curtain End of Act II</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene I Isolt's chamber. The scene represents a small vaulted chamber. In a recess at the back, Isolt lies on a couch. A silver lamp suspended from the ceiling lights the chamber. An arched doorway L. leads to an ante-room. Another R. to an inner room. Enter Brangwaine, L. Bran. Madam! Isolt! Is. of I. [Without stirring.] Who speaks that woeful name? Bran. 'Tis I. Will you not rise, and let me robe you? Is. of I. Is there no rest for me even in this grave, Where I lie ages dead? Let common souls Garment their bones in flesh, and rise again, When the great angel sounds; I will not rise Till he can bid the yesterdays of time Troop at his summons, wake the hawthorn-buds Of summers dead, wake my dead hopes, dead joys, To breathe and sing in the glad world I knew. Bran. The kingâthe king comes now to visit you. Is. of I. The king! Poor ghost! It is a thousand years Since last I heard him gibber. O Brangwaine, What horrors throng the grave, the lonely graveâ And thoughts, thoughts, thoughtsâmy God! what horrible thoughts, And rages: yet no deeds! Bran. Shake off these dreams From your sick soul, and rise; for Tristram's sake. Is. of I. [Sits on the couch.] For Tristram's sake? That name sounds like a spell. What shall I do for Tristram's sake? Bran. Live! Live! Speak fairly to the king. Tell him but all, Unseal the founts of mercy in his breast. All may be well. Is. of I. No, all cannot be well. Tristram is dead, I know; though I suppose His face is changed by death. I could not find him, In all the trackless waste beyond the grave. Bran. He livesâI know it. We shall have news ere long. Is. of I. Perhaps? Ruined, Brangwaine, and by my love! What baleful drop of hell's corrupting fire Curdles, like poison in a sacrament, The honey of love's flower? Bran. Vain question! Comeâ Isolt, arise! front the stern face of life, Be bold and live! [Isolt rises and Brangwaine robes her. Is. of I. For what, then, should I live? The saint has her white robe; dearer than life She guards its whiteness from the smutch of sin; I was the saint of joy, and clothed myself In love's supreme delights; and now, now, now, Behold my splendid robe tattered and frayed, Not to be patched again. [Sinks back on the couch. Enter Enna, L. Enna. Madam, the king! Is. of I. Let the king enter! Enter King Mark alone, L. He motions to Brangwaine, who retires, followed by Enna. King M. Isolt! [Isolt rises and faces himâa pause. Is. of I. I am here. You come, I know, to pelt me With stones of righteousness. Pelt and begone! King M. I see thee, and just anger bows the head To weep in pity's train. Is. of I. I ask no pity. Prepare the stake, the faggots; let me leap Into the core of fire, burn out this pain Within me, life! What fire can sting like this? King M. There's grace in true remorse, my erring wife. Is. of I. Erring? I erred, indeed, erred into wedlock! King M. Mad words! Is. of I. That was my only sin. King M. Still shameless? Is thy heart flint? Hast thou no word, no tear, Not one, to announce in thee repentant mind And justify forgiveness, which still yearns, Like a grieved angel, o'er that fallen head, And bids me, sinful man, show mercy now. Is. of I. Sir King, I am innocent. King M. Innocent? Oh! Yet thou didst love me once, by all sweet tokens That ever woman gave. And then, turn wanton! Is. of I. You are deceived! I never loved you, sir. King M. What! never loved me? Sorceress, for what end Hast thou enslaved me? Is. of I. Speech is vain. The curse Of Babel heaps confusion on our tongues. King M. If there be witchcraft here, it must be purged. Is. of I. The fire, the fire, ay, give me to the fire! So man's vile justice still on woman falls. Take my defiance and begone from me! Re-enter Brangwaine. King M. [To Brangwaine.] There is madness in her looks and in her words! Bran. My lord, a holy friar waits without. Sent by the archbishop. King M. In good time he comes, So, let him enter, bring him here, Brangwaine. [Exit Brangwaine. A pause. Re-enter Brangwaine with Kurvenal disguised as a friar. He salutes the king. Kur. I am armed In faith, my lord, and trust to win the fight. King M. [Looking at Isolt of Ireland.] May God have mercy on this erring soul! [Exeunt King Mark and Brangwaine, L. Is. of I. Well, friar, be brief, if thou wouldst have me bear, Without a groan, the torture of more words. Kur. Madam, I will be brief. Is. of I. In what saint's name Comest thou to conjure devils out of me? Kur. [In a low voice.] Tristram lives. Is. of I. Tristram! Bait'st thou with his name Some holy snare to mesh my unwary feet? That were foul treachery, friar. Kur. [Putting back his hood.] Beware of me If the hood make the friar! If not, why, trust me. Is. of I. Kurvenal! Thou here? And Tristram, Tristram lives? Or dost thou lie? Didst thou not say he lives? Kur. Lives, madam, but in such unhappy case, Death were a life more wholesome. Is. of I. Sick of his wound? Kur. It preys upon his body, as remorse Upon his soul, defying surgery. It is but Tristram's ghost that thinly pines On his pain-shaken couch, whereby weak life, Pale as death's handmaid, faltering stands. Is. of I. O God! And I not there! Where lies he sick? Who tends him? Kur. In his wife's castle by the Breton shore, Nursed by his wife, Isolt. Is. of I. His wife, Isolt! Ayâ'tis her right: she tends him night and day, Looks on his dying face, and when he calls Upon her name, she comes and smilesâbends o'er him With ministries of love, and feels him hers. I see it, and am in hell. Why comest thou hither To fill my breast with its eternal fire? Kur. He prays you, by your love, to come to him. She adds her prayer. Is. of I. Sheâadds her prayer? To me? How if I will not come? Kur. Then frankly, madam, I can but pray that you may live in bale. [Isolt laughs bitterly. Kur. If this be woman's love, a plague upon it; I'll keep my cowl. Is. of I. Still blunt, my trusty squire? Kur. Your artâyour art aloneâcan heal this wound, And will you let him die, the world's best knight, Like a sick hound? Shall I go back and tell him I sued to you in vain, that he must die? Is. of I. Dieâin her arms? The thought's a red-hot knife Stabbing my breast. How may I scape from this? Kur. Change garments with Brangwaine. Re-enter Brangwaine. Bran. Time flies! Is. of I. [To Brangwaine] Brangwaine? Oh, may I trust thee? Kur. May you trust her, madam? Would every woman were as staunch as she! Is. of I. Tristram, I come, I come! O winds and seas, Be gentle now, and waft me to my love! My true Brangwaine! Bran. 'Tis the last sin, Isolt, That even my foolish love may do for thee. Kur. Come, Night sweeps forward on her sable wings, We must ride faster than her hooting owls Swoop under branches, till we reach the coastâ And then, ho for the sea! [Isolt and Brangwaine change mantles. Kur. O Tristram, Tristram, Live but to-morrow by, and fill thy years With famous tales of mighty deeds achieved! [Symphony. Is. of I. [Embracing Brangwaine.] Farewell, dearest Brangwaine, never was woman To woman true, as thou, sweet friend, to me. Bran. Farewell, Isolt. Ride fast, all must be told When the king comes, and finds me in thy place. Is. of I. Then with my mantle take my place indeed, Reign here in Cornwall. Bran. Ah! What shrift may follow Upon confession is a thing to dread, Not to be jested on! Is. of I. I did not jest. May all good angels give thee all the bliss Thy dreams e'er promised, so farewell! Bran. Farewell! [Exeunt Isolt and Kurvenal, R. How oft I have mused upon the fateful hour Somewhere in ambush for me, dreamed it by, Moment by moment. Now it comes, I know 'Twill come in alien guise, looming more strangely For the fantastic visions of my mind. Well, well Isolt, I yet may wear thy crown. Enter Enna, L. Enna. Madam, the king! Bran. I wait upon his will. [Exit Enna. Grant me, sweet saints, courage and woman's wit! [She throws herself on the couch. Enter King Mark. He pauses, gazing at her. King M. Isolt! [Brangwaine prostrates herself at the king's feet. O can thy haughty spirit bow In true repentance? Miracle of grace! But kneel to heaven, not to me; who am bowed low Under the whips of shame. Rise up, and speak One mitigating word, that may atone Thy fatal beauty with my outraged love. Bran. Let me lie here in penance at thy feet, I dare not even look on thee. King M. Rise, Isolt! Thou hadst strange accusation in thine eyes, When last they blazed on me; give it a tongue, That I may stand accused of mine own conscience, If e'er in act or thought I have done thee wrong. God has so humbled me, I would cut off The hand of my offence, and enter maimed The kingdom of His grace. Bran. No wrong, my lord, Ever didst thou me! King M. Rise, then rise! [He raises her and recognises her. Brangwaine! Where is the queen? Bran. My king, curse, kill me; But first hear out my taleâ King M. [Sternly.] Where is the queen? Bran. Fled with the friar. King M. The friar? Bran. 'Twas Kurvenal Disguised. King M. Fled, fled! To horse! Bran. [Clinging to him.] King, hear me first! The queen is innocentâmine is the fault. King M. Innocent harlot! What! are ye devils both? Bran. Mine was the sin. Hear from a soul in torment The utter truth; not Tristram and Isolt Are false, but I, Brangwaine. King M. Riddles, more riddles! Enna! Re-enter Enna. Go, bid my page summon the grooms To saddle my best horse. Call out my guards And bid them mount in haste to ride with me. [Exit Enna. And now thy tale. Isolt is innocent, Thou guilty? Make this plainâay, make this plain. Bran. As o'er the seas we came, she drank with Tristram, Knowing not what she did, the magic draught Her mother had prepared for her and thee. King M. What was this draught? Bran. A cup of sorcery, A love-draught brewed with potent spells, and spiced With magic herbs; which when they drank, their blood, Quick with the flame of love's eternal spring, Ached in their glowing breasts, till the sweet sin Seemed but the passionate flower of life's delight. King M. How came they by that cup? Bran. They took it blindly From these weak erring hands, drank, and so fell. King M. Thou hast done this! O for what spite, Brangwaine, Hast thou made league with devils, in fair souls To sow this crescent flame? Thy deed confounds The ken of insight with its traitor face. Bran. I was the handmaid of my evil star. Isolt, in wifely duty, would have drunk The cup of peace with Tristram, and mistook The phials. King M. [Apart.] Fate! O Fate! O my lost wife! She never loved me, never, never, never! Yet she could sing the very tune of love In my enchanted ear, in her young arms Fold me, tillâO false harlot! Fool, O fool! I will turn anchoret. Let me never more Feel the sweet softness of a woman's breast. Lewd fires of hell seethe under, and its touch Is mere damnation! [He moves towards the door. Bran. Oh, stay! my lord, my lord, Hear me once more! [Clutches his mantle and falls on her knees. King M. What, woman, art thou there? I had forgot thee. More? Ha! Is there more? What worse abomination makes thee pale? Bran. The queen is innocent. King M. Darest thou so lie? Bran. She never did deceive thee with false love. King M. Not she? Bran. [Rising.] I swear to thee it was not she Thatâloved thee so. King M. Not she? What sorcery then Out of the impassioned air bodied her warm? Bran. I was that guilty, yet most loving woman Who gave theeâwhat she ne'er even feigned to give. King M. Thou, thou, Brangwaine! Bran. Thou hast my secret now. King M. What shall I do with thee? Bran. [Sighing.] Even what thou wilt, I know that I have lost the dearest thing Ever I had. I stole it like a thief, And like a thief must answer for my deed. I knew I had to suffer; but I lovedâ O how I loved! King M. Yet like a living lie, Didst thou creep to my breast, flatter me blind. Bran. The sins we do, we see but from withinâ See through the thick heartbeats, plumed like eagles, That were in others carrion birds. But oh, Here I lay bound, the slave of secrecy! King M. I must have full confession from thy lips. How came this crime to pass? Bran. To save worse sin, The sin thou didst in ignorance deem the queen's. She with fierce threats, by solemn oaths, constrained me To hide her love's default. But soonâay, soon, I sinned with all the passion of my heart. King M. Thy fault is but the blemish of a flower, Matched with the ghastly horror that but now O'erwhelmed me. Yet I am like one suddenly waked, Who finds the ravishing music of his dream But the sweet inward echo of a tune Of the mere world, that woke him. Woman, woman, Give me that dream again! Bran. Would I could give thee More, more thanâI have given, my blood, my soul, I, but the mere occasion of thy dream, Not even that dream, which fades and nevermore I can make live again. Well, cast me forth Like Hagar. Righteous Abraham had less cause. King M. O tangling briar, whose blossoms were so sweet, I cannot drive their odour from my sense! Bran. Then a last grace, I'll not be banished now. I am mad for some swift death, demand it thus! [She throws herself passionately into the king's arms. He puts her away gently. She sinks on the couch and covers her face with her hands. King M. Thy love may win thy pardon, be content! âSin follows sin, as wolf the wolf to preyââ So by her sinful tongue was I rebuked. Enter Enna. Enna. My lord, your knights are mounted. King M. Let them wait! [Waves his hand to Enna. [Exit Enna. Shall I, a sinner, stained with my brother's blood, Which now Tristram, his son, blindly avenges, Be slower than just God, who has pardoned me, To pardon? Yet my crime gave, by God's grace, This realm to Christ. Marvellous are His ways! Bran. [Not looking up.] Sir, I know all, know you for what you are. Repenting sin, the sinner grows a saint. King M. Come, rise, Brangwaine; for thou shalt ride with me. The Holy Church must counsel me for means, That may redeem this ruin of our lives. [He raises Brangwaine. As the stage is darkened the scene changes. End of Scene I Scene II A weed-grown platform in the castle of Isolt of Brittany. The sea with coast-line of receding cliffs is seen over a ruined parapet in the background. L. a tower of the castle with arched doorway. On an angle in the parapet R., a small turret with steps leading up to it. Tristram lies upon a couch L. C., Caradoc watching beside him. The sunset-glow falls from the R. upon Tristram and the tower at the L. side. Cara. The sunset, O ay, the sunset. I have seen many a one in my day; but never a one like this. The dumb spirits of the air speak to me now, gathering and whispering, over Tristram's sleep. Night and sleep, night and sleep! Every morning brings at last but night and sleep. That is the weird of man. [Distant tinkling of cow-bells heard. They come nearer gradually. Bag-pipe heard. The cow-bells, O ay, the cow-bells. That is evening's voice. [He looks over the parapet.] So, my pretty little milkers, there you come; and there you will come, to-morrow and to-morrow, though Tristram live or die. [The herd-boy sings. Herd-boy 's Song I King Hoel sailed with his warmen bold, Ulalu! Sing Ulalu! To woo the Queen of the Isles of Gold, Elalu loro, Ulalu! II He sailed away in the days of yore, Ulalu! Sing Ulalu! But home to his land came nevermore, Elalu loro, Ulalu! [As the song ends Tristram wakes. Tris. Isolt! Cara. What cheer, dear master? You have slept long. Tris. Ho mate! How heads she now? Are we making land? Cara. On land, master. 'Tis shore we are now. O ay! Tris. [Half rising and looking round.] Where am I? Oh, I remember. Go watch, go watchâscan the sea for a sail. Comes she not yet? Cara. Ay, she will come sure enough. She will come to you even if it were from the ends of the earth. But 'tis early to expect her yet. The channel is full of baffling winds, master, O ay, baffling winds. But she will come sure enough. Tris. Awayâaway! Scan the sea! [Caradoc mounts on the turret of the parapet and looks out. Comes there no sail? Cara. I see but the lonely waste of blue water, and the channel swell breaking on the cliffs, as the tide makes to the flood; and the white companies of the gulls. 'Twill be slack water anon. No sail, yet, master. But she will surely come. O ay! she will come sure enough. Tris. She does not come, she does not come! [Sinks back on the couch. Cara. [Approaching him.] Master! Sir Tristram! Gone back to the land of dreams. Well, 'tis better so. But Death will keep his offing from him till she comes. Enter from the castle L., Isolt of Brittany. Is of B. Tristram! Still sleeping? Caradoc, is this but sleep? Cara. He spoke to me but nowâbade me look out over the sea for a sail. Is. of B. Leave me now, good Caradoc, I will watch alone. Go back to the landing-place. See that all is ready. [Exit Caradoc. She comes now. Will she come? Do I desire it? O God! in my devotion's agony I schooled myself to humbleness, and prayed That she would come, begged her to heal this wound Which gave him to my arms, to have him, hold him, Care for his wants, tend him as a mother tends Her sick child! Oh, he stirs. Tris. Isolt! Isolt! Is. of B. I am here, Tristram! Tris. Go, go! scan the sea! Ye have no eyes. Is. of B. [Retiring, but looking back at Tristram.] She hath stolen before my face The jewel of my love, left me to clasp This ruined casket; with my unpitied tears Claim what is most mine own, bitterly know I am but his body's gaoler, while she reigns, Queen of the world of dreams wherein he lives. Better still sicken with him day by day, Ebb with his life, ere healing come through her. Tris. Caradoc! Kurneval! Where are these traitors? Is. of B. Tristram! what wouldst thou? Tris. [Starting up.] Hark it is her voiceâ She calls me o'er the seas. Launch my swift galley, Run out the oars, men, hoist the bellying sail; I'll rove till Doomsday o'er the waste of waves, And the black rover, Death, shall board me never, Until I find her. Ho! To sea, to sea! [He rises and walks feebly towards the centre of the stage. Is. of B. [Supporting him.] Nay, thou art still too weak! Tris. [Struggling with her.] Lay not thy cold white hands upon me. Off! Is. of B. Let me but lead thee to thy couch again. Tris. Thou art a ghost, thy touch chills my sick blood. I will not dance with thee. I know the measure Which thou wouldst have me tread, down to the grave. The music ends in dirges, and the lights Are but corpse-candles held in dead men's hands. Off! Off, I say! [He thrusts her back and stands alone. Is. of B. Tristram! Tris. Where is the sea? I'll dance there with the waves. They leap for ever To the brave tune of life. O weak! too weak! [He staggers, and Isolt of Brittany supports him to the couch. Is. of B. I will go watch the sea. Tris. I hear its voice! The winds blow fair? Is. of B. O yes, the wind blows fair! [She ascends the parapet and looks out. [Aside.] A sail! Almost in port. That ominous bird Of the blue waves, so small a hand's-breadth hides it, The ship of doom! It should o'ershroud the skies With night, appal the deep with moaning thunder! The silence is more fearful. O for a spell To sink it now, though with it sank the world! Tris. Comes there no sail? Is. of B. [Coming to himâaloud.] Patience awhile. I thoughtâ'twas fantasy! Tris. What hast thou seen? Is. of B. The white wing of a gull. Tris. No more? [Groans. Is. of B. If 'twere a sail? Tris. Do not lie to me. It is a shipâshe comes! At last! At last! Is. of B. I thought but now I saw a distant sail. Tris. Death aims his last keen arrow, winged with joy, Against my weakness. Come, Isolt, Isolt. Bring me life's healing flame! Tell me she comes! Is. of B. There are an hundred ships upon the sea, And one alone is hers. Tris. Go, look again! [She goes to the parapet. Is. of B. The phantom thing has left the field of sight A void of heaving waves. The near cliff hides Her nearness from mine eyes. Her eager feet Even now are tingling for the touch of earth; Nay, the swift keel has grated on the strand By this; she treads the Breton grass, and speeds Up the slope, to take my citadel With passionate assault. No help, save death! [Looking at Tristram. Tris. [Half rising.] What seest thou? Is. of B. Naughtâonly the waste of waves. There is no sail. Tris. False, false! She will not come. Death winds his final challenge, and the blast Cracks the strong will to live. I plunge alone Into the abyss of night. [He sinks back on the couch. Is. of B. [Rushing over to him.] O leave me not! Love, take me with thee, me, thy wedded wife. [She throws herself down by the couch, clasps him in her arms and lays her head on his breast. Enter Caradoc. Cara. Madam! Sir Tristram! 'Tis the queen, the queen! Is. of B. Ay, let her enter now. [Exit Caradoc. A pause. Then re-enter Caradoc with Isolt of Ireland and Kurvenal. Isolt of Ireland advances quickly to C., then stops, gazing at Tristram. Is. of I. Tristram! 'Tis IâIsolt! Tris. Whose voice was that? Is. of I. [Coming nearer.] Tristram! Tris. [Struggling to rise.] What weight is on my breast? Off! Off! Thou nightmare! It is she, she callsâIsolt! [He flings Isolt of Brittany off, and rises and walks firmly to Isolt of Ireland. They embrace. Is. of I. Tristram, I come to heal thee. Tris. Oh, my love, Thy arms, thy eyes indeed! My queen, my star, My health shines in those eyes, and I am healed. Let us to sea, we'll give the slip to death And sail for everâAh! it is too late! [He staggers and falls back into Kurvenal's arms. Kurvenal lays him down on the couch. Is. of I. He swoons. I have the cordial here. O Tristram! Tristram! [Coming close. Kur. Madam, this clay was Tristram. Is. of B. Death, I thank thee! [She laughs, kisses Tristram and sinks down by the head of the couch. Is. of I. [Passes behind couch and stands near the head gazing at Tristram.] I keep the last kiss of thy living lips, And will not kiss thee, dead. By your leave, lady, I would but look upon the face I loved. 'Tis an old tale, no need for jealous hate. Tristram, we drank together once, but now I drink alone. The love-drink brought us death; I pledge love in the death-drink. [She drinks the death-drink and gazes in Tristram's face. Enter through archway behind, R., King Mark and Brangwaine with knights and attendants. Now I give place. [Isolt of Ireland passes to lower end of couch. Lie by thy husband's side, Let me, his mistress, at my lover's feet Take the great rest of death. Hark how the sea Mourns more divinely than a thousand harps. It is the dirge of Tristram and Isolt. [She kneels at Tristram's feet. Tableau [King Mark approaches and stands behind the couch at Tristram's head, R. He draws his sword, kisses the cross of the hilt and lays it on Tristram's breast. Brangwaine draws near. Isolt of Ireland looks up, smiles and sinks dying at Tristram's feet. King Mark remains standing, extends his hands over Tristram's dead face in benediction. The others kneel: Kurvenal, R. of King Mark slightly up-stage behind and R. of Isolt of Brittany; Caradoc, L. of foot of couch, behind and L. of Isolt of Ireland, by whom Brangwaine has knelt, supporting her in her arms. The knights and attendants form a semi-circle behind King Mark and Kurvenal. Funeral March. Slow Curtain. The End</field>
