      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Court before the Temple of the Sun. An Altar before the gates of the Temple. Villoma. Vil. God of my fathers! hear me. Thou, thron'd on flame! Thou, at whose dawn, the world Thy visible creation, bursts the veil Of darkness, and in new-born life and lustre Sees all that breathe, look up, and bless thy beams: Hear my deep anguish! Now no more, my voice Calls down, as once in happier years, thy ray, Pure source of being, thro' the womb of earth To stream fertility. No more, thy priest Fresh gathering from the spring free tribute, lays The prime of the year, of herb, and fruit, and flow'r Nature's sweet offering on thy bloodless shrine. Far other gifts I bring: receive these spoils, That mournful on thy golden gates I hang, The lance, the helm, and buckler: while I call On thee, once God of Peace, to arm thy sons With dauntless fortitude. Let brave Zamorin Again exultant from Pizarro's host Return: and on thy heav'n-born child, sole heir Of slain Huascar, here, in triumph fix The crown that grac'd his sires on Cuzco's throne! Zama enters, kneels. Zama. My sire! Vil. My Zamaâ Oh may the blessing of a father's voice Assuage thy grief! Zama. Yetâlives my husband? sayâ Deceive me not: I think I could endure From thee to hear his doom: let none less lov'd Say to thy child, âZamorin rests in death.â Vil. How shall I answer thee? Zama. Oh speak. Vil. His doom Is yet unknown. Day after day, in vain I claim the hostage. Zama. Ah! the foot that treads Where the base Spaniard haunts, to Cuzco's walls Shall never more return. Our word was sacred: On the dread day mark'd out for Cuzco's woe, This fort impregnable, yon gold-roof'd temple, Gifts, and exhaustless wealth, and countless gems, Offerings from kings thro' ages to their god, Had grac'd Pizarro's triumph, if Peru, Regardless of the city of her god, Fear'd to confront the Spaniard. Such the terms, And famine forc'd compliance, when Pizarro Proclaim'd by solemn oath, that fresh supplies Should Cuzco's wants relieve, if brave Zamorin Went forth the public hostage, pledg'd for Cuzco: Yea, o'er his banner'd cross the Spaniard vow'd, That, if Peru, ere that dread day, once more Should arm her routed multitudes, Zamorin Again should lead the battle. Thus allur'd From Cuzco's walls the voluntary hostage Went fearless forth. Vil. Yet vibrates on my heart His farewell word. Zama. But, from that day, no succour Has Cuzco's wants reliev'd, no voice has breath'd Word of Zamorin. What avails it now, That to defend the city of her god, And free her far-fam'd chieftain, arm'd Peru Her banner'd rainbow rears, and hosts on hosts Fill all the plain? in vain. The perjur'd Spaniard Basely detains the hostage: and Zamorin, Whose brave resistance rous'd Peru, whose spirit Glow'd thro' the mingled mass, whose arm alone Could guide in war her multitudes, Zamorin, Th'avenger of his country, 'mid yon host Pines in base chains, or now, an untomb'd corse, Feasts their vile dogs of carnage. Vil. Calm thy soul. Zama. Hear me, my sire, nor fondly feign a hope No longer felt. Now grant my only pray'r: let me go forth, And learn Zamorin's fate. Vil. And wouldst thou leave A father's arms, and Cuzco's hallow'd walls, To rush amidst the riot, and flush'd camp Of yon fell spoilers? Zama. To Zamorin's arms I haste, to sooth his soul, or with him perish. Vil. Urge not a vain request. Zama. Must then Zamorin, Who went the public hostage, who reliev'd The public woe, when famine and despair Knelt to the foe for bread, mid ruthless men Perish, of all abandon'd, far from Zama, On whose responsive look his eye might dwell, And while it swims in death's o'ershadowing mist, Catch, ere it close for ever, the last solace Of one fond tear? my father! by that name! Oh by the memory of her who bore me, Whose image, ne'er forgotten, lives in Zama, Whose voice, ne'er heard in vain, speaks in thy heart While her lov'd daughter pleadsâ Orcas suddenly enters. Vil. Why, Orcas, here? Whence this intrusion? Orcas. Zeal to save thy life, And Cuzco's tow'rs, and the sun's hallow'd temple From spoil and profanation. Not alone By the fell Spaniard, by her native sons, Cuzco is doom'd to perishâ Vil. How? Orc. By treason. Vil. Treason! Zama. Oh horror! Orc. Since the perjur'd Spaniard, Regardless of his vow, once more cut off The scant supply, despair and swift revolt Have spread from breast to breast. This day, ere dawn, When wearied from my night-watch I return'd, Thro' the thick mists that swept the mount, I saw A fire-ball from the Spanish camp beneath Flash forth, a second from the southern mound Crost it in air: that was th'appointed signal. A youth by horror struck and deep remorse, Confest the crime. And, here, in that dark cavern Where the sun ne'er sent down a beam, vile traitors Leagu'd with Gulaxaâ Vil. [interrupting him.] Ha! that base usurper! Whom fell Pizarro treacherously has lur'd With Cuzco's promis'd crown? Orc. The same.âAll know His rank, how glorious once, an honour'd Inca, Sprung of the sun's pure race, of royal blood: Butâfrom that day when captur'd by Pizarro, The conqueror spar'd his life, the base Peruvian Thro' fear, or fraud (what recks the worthless motive) Worships the fell invader: so fame rumours: And, in these walls, amid faint-hearted men Dispirited by woe, his vaunted pow'r And favour with Pizarro, each new day Gain him new followers. With that man, the traitors Who, in their turn, this day the fortress guard, Hold secret conference. Vil. What their fell intent? Orc. To fix the hour, when to these hallow'd walls Pizarro shall advance, and on this temple Upraise his blood-stain'd banner. Vil. First, his steel Shall pierce my bosom. Zama. First, the hallow'd stream That warms this heart, a Coya's blood shall flow, And on his brow the daughter of the sun Draw down vindictive fire. Vil. Speed, Orcas, haste: Summon the chosen chiefs that guard the temple: And let the signal wave, and,âso deceiv'dâ The traitors join Gulaxa. I will meet him. Tho' long adversity has bow'd the sons Of Cuzco, tho' consuming famine slack'd Their pithless joints, yet in these walls are men Who in their heav'n-born monarch's righteous cause Will gladly perish. Hasteâ Orc. Be such my death. [Exit. [Loud shouts and cries heard. Zama. Whence that loud shout, those cries? Vil. 'Tis now the time: The guard at my command here lead the Spaniard. Ne'er, till this day, have Cuzco's sons beheld A Spanish chief in chains. Arcal rushes in. Shouts continued. Arc. Priest of the sun! Speed forth, allay the tumult, aid the guard O'erpow'r'd by numbersâ One of the Guard rushing in. Guard. Holy father! haste, Or Cuzco streams with blood. Vil. Zama, retire. Zama. Retire! thy life in danger? come, my father. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Public Square. Peruvians contending with the Guard conducting Almagro in chains. Guard. Drive, drive them back. 1 Per. Think of Peru's slain race. 2 Per. [to Almagro.] Give me my son. [Almagro in silence shows signs of pity and horror. 3 Per. Where is my father's corse? Scorn you to answer? you did rack his age To sport your children, and your hounds lapp'd up The life-blood as it spouted from his woundsâ 1 Per. Your goblets foam'd, and the feast shook with laughter In mockery of our wounds; and when your captives Exhausted sunk, ye rous'd them to new life By pangs unknown before. Peruvians. Force back the guard. Perish, fell monster! [Peruvians forcing Almagro from the overpowered Guard.] Guard. Rescue him. Villoma, Zama, Arcal, enter. Vil. Peruvians. Per. Strike, ere Villoma save him. Per. Die. Vil. My children! Have you no pity? have you chang'd your nature? Oh spare him. Zama. Hear, Peruvians, know ye not His voice who bids you spare. It is Villoma's. Ye are his children, allâ Per. Perish, fell monsterâ Zama. [rushing amid them in act to murder Almagro.] Oh sun, withdraw thy light! murder in Cuzco An unarm'd captive!ânot on himâon meâ Here, on a Coya, daughter of your god, Satiate your vengeance. [They all fling down their weapons at Zama's feet. Alm. Lady! not for me Hazard your life. Oh Spain! are these barbarians? Peruvians. [kneeling to Villoma.] Forgive thy children! yet, oh holy father, Look down with eye of pity on our sufferings. Resistance now is vain. Priest of the sun, Resign the fort. Behold us bow'd to earth With want, and woe, and famine. Vil. How resign it? A solemn adjuration binds my soul Ne'er to admit the Spaniard, till Zamorin Here yields the fort, or, to confirm his will, Sends back the hallow'd bracelet. Zama. Ne'er again Shall Cuzco hail that consecrated chain. Zamorin is no more. Alm. Nay, weep not, lady! Zamorin yet is living. Zama. Living! Spaniard! Vil. My sons, depart in peace. [they go.] Stranger! approachâ Learn from your foe to pity and protect Him whom your pow'r can crush. Alm. Are these, barbarians? They told me that Peruvians were at best, Men but in shape; in soul, of brutal nature. We Spaniards know you not. Vil. And who art thou From whose astonish'd soul the voice of praise Sounds like reproof? say, why hast thou assail'd Basely this fortress, while thy perjur'd chief Detains our hostage? Alm. Bid Pizarro answer: This recks not me: I broke no sacred truce. Vil. Your vows ye break at will: our word was sacred. What but leagued treason urged you to assail This rock in frantic insolence? Alm. My lance Was met by valiant men. Vil. Presumptuous youth! Declare the truth, nor let deceitful words Draw righteous vengeance down. Alm. Cease thy vain threats: I speak not at command. Vil. Proud man! Zama. My father, He looks like one whom gentleness may gain More than harsh force compel. I pray thee, stranger! Aught know'st thou of Zamorin? Alm. He yet livesâ So rumour speaksâbutâby Pizarro, held,â As I amâbound. Zama. A hostage! and in bonds! Inhuman men. Alm. All are not such, fair lady! Vil. Who art thou, and what urg'd thy rash assault? Alm. A passion, haply, to Peru unknown: Glory. Had conquest crown'd me, Spain had rank'd Mine, with proud names, whose mention fires the soul, Columbus, Cortez, and far-fam'd Pizarro. Fair dames of proud Castille, at solemn jousts Had wing'd their knights to victory, with the praise Of young Almagro: and, if here I perish I have not sham'd my sire. Vil. Almagro's son, Whose army fronts our warriors, while Pizarro Encamps beneath these walls? Alm. Brief let me be. Scarce had I landed on this coast, (few days Now past) with men, and steeds, and warlike stores, Trebling Pizarro's battle, when my sire, Yet weak with uncur'd wounds, to me resign'd His host, and high command. Thus, arm'd with pow'r And due authority, I sought Pizarro, With fair proposal, instantly to join Our squadrons, and disperse your numbersâ Vil. [interrupting him.] How! Rash insolence of youth! captive, beware! Look on those bonds. Alm. Your multitudes dispers'd, Then, if that haughty chieftain yet disown'd The signet that I bore, the Emperor's grant Of Cuzco to my sire, to force compliance. I came, Pizarro heard, and taunting, bade me Fix on your rocks my flag; there crown Almagro: And with bold impress charge my maiden shield, Yet bloodless, and but prickt with tilting points. He spake, and smil'd in scorn: my blood boil'd in me: And forth I sallied where your host beheld me, Ere yet my followers join'd, pois'd on my lance Vault o'er the moat, and with adventurous grasp From rock to rock climb up the craggy fort, And chase your warriors, till one daring chief Seiz'd me unawares, and reckless of his life, In the deep flood plung'd with me. More I know not. You best can tell how rescu'd from the flood You drew me forth, and when in swoon I lay, What warriors stript an unresisting captive, And thus enslav'd: you best can tell the death That now awaits me. Vil. Fear notâ Alm. Fear! we Spaniards Shrink not from death. Zama. Thy life redeems the hostage, Almagro for Zamorin, chief for chief. Alm. Noârather than consent to my release, Pizarro, in thy sight, beneath these walls Would stab the hostage. 'Tis not life I seek: A Spanish chief in Cuzco manacled, Almagro's son slav'd by Peruvian bonds, Seeks but the consolation of the grave To hide in death his shame. YetâI will sue thee: And bend the suppliant knee: a father's woe Weighs on my heart. You are a man of mercy; Send back my corseâmy lanceâa father's gift, To old Almagro. It will soothe the warrior To hang it o'er my tomb. And let your herald Say, how I fought, how diedâ Zama. [flinging herself at Villoma's feet.] Oh let me sue For mercy. Such as he, in prime of life, Zamorin: and each tear that falls for him, Pleads for this captive youth. And haply too While on his doom we pause, and calmly weigh What caution dictates, in his native land One, sad as Zama, at the thought of war Presses a bleeding heart, and mourns as dead, Him yet alive. Vil. Zama, pronounce his doom. Zama. Freedom. Zamorin's wife from bondage frees thee. [Unclasping his chains. Alm. Touch not these chains: I am a man disgrac'd. Zama. What mean your words? Spaniard, the sons of Cuzco Deem guilt, and not misfortune a disgrace. Youth, thou art free: in victory's ruthless hour, Remember Zama. To Pizarro go, Say how Peruvian conquerors treat their captives, So bid him treat his hostage. Alm. I will force him To free the hostage, or no more Almagro Will woo renown in arms, nor wield a lance Where love and glory point the warrior's course. Expect thy lord: my life for his is pledg'd. Cuzco, ere night, shall view within her walls Zamorin, or Almagro. [Exeunt. END OF ACT THE FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Pizarro's Camp beneath Cuzco. Pizarro. Piz. Perish the Indian who resists Pizarro! Perish, Zamorin! not to rouse defiance I lur'd that chieftain hither. Had my threats Or proffer'd realms avail'd, not Cuzco's tow'rs And fruitful empire, but the western world Had own'd me sovereign. In that Inca's soul, Tho' mild and merciful, a firmness reigns That knows not fear: but sooner at my bidding Would Andes' rock on its eternal base Than his calm spirit yieldâ Juan enters. My brother! Juanâ Hast thou succeeded? butâanother day!â And on that captur'd fort our chiefs shall grasp Wealth boundless as their wish. Juan. Some I have gain'd, Leaders of note: others, Almagro's gold Heapt from far Chili, and rich realms between, Has brib'd to quit thy standard: Chaves, Fernandez, Haro, and dauntless Lerma. Piz. Dark-brow'd Lerma! Almagro's golden ingots outweigh mine. Juan. No. His stern spirit broods o'er fancied wrongs, He has not smil'd since Cassamarca's fight. I met him mid his squadron, near him stood A herald from Almagro: at my offers Th'indignant chieftain smil'd, and loud exclaim'd That all might hear, âBase souls by gold are brib'd, âBrave men by glory: from wrong'd Lerma's lip, âEre I depart, this day, your chief shall learn âWhat gifts must gain a warrior.â Piz. Haughty spirit! Juan. Your force is much diminish'd. Sixty horsemen: Of pikes and cross-bows full an hundred gone. Had not the flood, in which we saw him plung'd, O'er young Almagro clos'd, and yonder signal That sweeps the rocks confirm'd Gulaxa's word, Despair had bow'd my spirit. Piz. On that Inca My trust is fixt: and, if his art prevail, This day, ere night-fall, yon rock-structur'd fort By strength of mortal arm impregnable, Shall at my summon's yield: and Cuzco's tow'rs, Proud palaces, and mansions of delight, Rich fanes, and gold-roof'd temples, pav'd with gems, Wait my disposal. Thenâthe rebel chiefs Who swell Almagro's numbers, at my feet Shall prostrate fall, and shout Pizarro's name, While from yon battlements I view beneath me, Day after day, Almagro's vaunted host Perish without a blow. Herald enters. Her. [to Pizarro.] My lord! the chiefs Who faithful to your banner yet remain, Now claim your presence. Piz. Claim it! [after deliberation.]âBring Zamorin, Th'unyielding Inca, where my chiefs in council Shall mark his dreadful doom. [Herald goes.] This will, methinks, Sooth them awhile, ere conquest on yon walls Waves my proud banner. Juanâthou attend. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Tent of the Chiefs in Council. Alvarados, Benalcazar, Spanish Chiefs. Alv. Comrades! be firm. Brave Benalcazar, hear me. I grant our loss is heavy, Chaves, Fernandez, Haro, and valiant Lerma: chiefs of proof: Men of wise voice in council, and whose arm Chain'd victory to their standard. They are gone: And we have cause for grief, none for despair, If we who yet are left, view not each other With that cold eye of timorous distrust, That ill befits a soldier. [Towards the conclusion of this speech, Pizarro enters, and takes his seat as Chief of the Council. After long silence, Pizarro rises.] Piz. Why thus silent? Let none despair. Time was, fame-honour'd chiefs! When by pale fear, and woe, and want encircled, On a lone island near this coast I drew Thus, with my sword, a line: âBehold (I said) âOn this side, danger and immortal glory: âThere, safety and dishonour.â Blush, Castile! All, all but thirteen warriors, left Pizarro. There, the heav'n-destin'd conquerors of Peru Month after month obscurely lay conceal'd, And glory knew us not: but, when our foot Once trod upon this coast, our second step Tow'r'd on the neck of monarchs. Alv. On this sword I laid, in pledge of faith, a soldier's hand, Ere victory blazing round Pizarro's brow Had lur'd the fickle noon-swarm. The bright sun Allur'd not me, nor shall the storm appal. Pizarro's cause is mine: and may this arm Wither in battle, when I turn my lance Against his helm. Piz. Brave chief, behold this gem: 'Twas king Ataliba's: he died, and left us Heir to his wealth. Take, and transmit this jewel To thy son's sons, to late posterity, As a memorial that Pizarro knew Thy worth, nor lightly honour'd it. Herald enters. Her. My lord, The hostage waits thy will. Piz. Bring him before us. [Herald goes. Your well-weigh'd voiceâI am but one among youâ Shall fix his doom. Alv. Fain would I, front to front Behold him. Since that hard-contested battle When singly he assail'd me, as I slew His routed host, I ne'er have seen that warrior. You still refus'd me. Piz. I had ever hope So to have sway'd him, that his soul had bow'd Submissive to your will: my threats avail'd not. YetâI have witness'd men who boldly brav'd A single front, turn pale and quake at sight Of chiefs in council. Herald enters with Zamorin. Alv. In his air and form Reigns simple grandeur, and on that calm front I trace the visible impress of a mind That yields not to base fear. [Zamorin regardless of the Council, unclasps a bracelet, and crushes it, link after link. Zam. [to himself.] Oh sacred charge! Pledge of a monarch's love, a nation's trust, Farewell for ever. [Kisses it. Alv. Why, Peruvian, thus Unclasp that bracelet from thy arm, why rend it Link after link? Zam. [to himself.] Not their unhallow'd hands: Their touch shall not pollute thee. So, [crushing it.] escape Their sacrilegious avariceânorâperhapsâ Attest Zamorin's frailty. Alv. Peruvian! We are not by your spoils so lur'd, so slav'd By every glittering toy, that we had stript thee Of that poor ornament. Brave Inca, say, Why dost thou tread that bauble under foot? Zam. I'll answer thee, when it is crush'd to atoms. Say. [To Pizarro.] Have I leave to speak? Piz. We Spaniards, Inca, Do not condemn our prisoners unheard. Zam. Man, man, thou mock'st me. Look, where thou art thron'd, Look, where I stand. And hast thou heart to mock me? Alv. Thou shalt have patient hearing. Piz. We attend. Zam. It ever hath been custom with our kings, From great Huana Capac, our first monarch, The offspring of the sun, when they select A leader of their forces, round his arm To bind the chain which in the hour of peace Circles their neck: that bracelet, linkt by hands Celestial, all Peru so sacred deems, That Cuzco's chiefs beholding it would yield The city, and the temple of their god. Who bears that bracelet, speaks, and is obey'd Like one from heav'n. No eye shall see it more; 'Tis crush'd to atoms. Alv. Wherefore? Zam. I receiv'd it From good Huascar, on the very night He perish'd, by the fell usurper slain, Sent by Ataliba, whom you did murder. [The Council murmurs enraged. Ben. To torture with him. Zam. Whence this sudden rage? Ben. Away with him. Zam. In what have I offended? Or can you not in patience hear the deed That you had heart to act? Alv. Hear, hear him, comrades! The language of plain truth, howe'er it gall me, Is not unwelcome to a soldier's ear. On with your speech. You shall not interrupt him. Zam. When I came forth your hostage, not your prisoner, I charg'd Villoma to refuse all terms If by that chain unvouch'd; for I had heard That ye had instruments of hellish pow'r To force the tongue to utterance: now to feign What the soul knew was false, and now deny The truth that is our birthright from above. I never shrunk, as these deep scars may witness, From wounds in war, but what ye might inflict When cool the blood, I knew not. This I know, That man is frail: and doubts, yeaâfears came o'er me, Lest in the heart here bosom'd, human frailty Might underneath the agony of torture, Betray its weakness. Ben. Then bid yonder fort Instantly yield, or the keen rack shall goad Your quivering limbs. Zam. I now can stand the trial: For what the tongue may rave when nature groans In madd'ning torture, now has no avail. The chain is crush'd. Gulaxa enters in haste. Piz. Gulaxa! Gul. Brave Pizarro, Art thou prepar'd to lead thy host in arms, When I advance the signal? Piz. Yes. Go forthâ And reign at Cuzco. Zam. Reign! noâbase usurper. Piz. Pizarro crowns him. Zam. On his brow your hand May fix a crown: but you are strangers to us. 'Tis not the diadem that awes our souls, Peru reveres her father in her king: Our's is the heart's pure homage. Gul. Hear, Zamorin. Cuzco obeys my signal: yetâI know There are within yon fort who still resist. Alone thy influence sways them: bid them yield: Enough of blood has stream'd. They who oppose me, Shall surely die. Zam. I pity whom thou spar'st. Gul. Think that thou view'st Villoma prone on earth, His grey hairs stain'd with gore: think on thy Zama, When ruthless war unchains his triple fiends, Rapine, and Lust, and Murder. Zam. Lord of Nature! Who in yon orb of living light, to earth, Faint shadowest forth thy glory: pow'r supreme! Who for high ends to man unsearchable, Send'st forth thy dreadful ministers of vengeance, Tempest and spotted plague, and flame-wing'd bolts; And now, along the violated deep Hast sent, more fell than tempest, plague, and fire, From other worlds, the outcast of mankind To waste this realm: to thee, oh Sun! I call: And join my voice to that which mute to man, Pleads audibly in heav'n and in each drop Of innocent blood, spilt upon earth, draws down Dire retribution on the murderer's brow. Henceâmurderer! [Gulaxa departs. As he goes loud shouts are heard. Voices without.] Almagro. HailâAlmagro. Herald enters. Her. [to Pizarro.] My lordâAlmagro's son, on foaming steed, Speeds thro' your camp: with him his far-fam'd leaders, Herrada, Garcias, and renown'd Orgognez. Andâfrom your squadrons, many a fickle soldier Gathers around them. Hark! [shouts heard.] the air resounds With shouts of young Almagro. Piz. Chiefs, be firmâ On you Pizarro rests: and plunder'd Cuzco Shall all your toils o'erpayâ Amid shouts of AlmagroâYoung Almagro, Herrada, Garcias, and Orgognez, enter. Ha! who art thou? Art thou a spirit risen from the dead, To haunt me at mid-day? Alm. None from the dead. Herrada! stay with me: go, trusty Garcias, Haste to my sire: relate what here has past. Orgognez, ere three hours have wing'd their flight, Be it thy charge to lead my chosen squadrons To storm this camp, if yet Pizarro brave us. [Orgognez and Garcias depart. [To Pizarro's Council.] Are these the chiefs whom terror chain'd to earth, When o'er the fosse I sprung, and scal'd the rock? And slept your swords when one of Spanish blood Sunk in your sight? Alv. The sword and lance were pow'rless Gainst that proud fort where our good cannon fail'd. Butâwhen I saw thee mid surrounding foes Rush singly unappall'd, old Alvarados Heard on his back war's iron harness ring. Methought in each old scar the whizzing shaft Sunk, as when first it pierc'd me. Alm. Hear, Pizarroâ Dismiss thy chiefs: let us confer in secret. Piz. Retire awhile, my friends. [The Chiefs depart. Alm. [staying Zamorin.] Is this the hostage? Zam. You see Zamorin. Alm. Go not hence, brave man. Thro' me thy Zama greets thee. Zam. Name her not: The very sound unmans me. Zama, Zama, Oh may'st thou never hear what I have suffer'd! Alm. [to Pizarro.] Tho' thou resist my sire's just claim, and mock The Emperor's sacred signetâ Piz. [interrupting him.] Heav'n forefend! Alm. Yet we may meet on terms: and, in that hope, Before thy warriors I reproach'd thee not, But face to face here breathe my just rebuke. Yet know I to forgive, and once aton'd, Remember not th'offense. Piz. Thenâwe are friends. Declare the terms. Alm. First, free this hostage. Zam. Me? Spaniard! art thou aware of thy demand? Piz. Why free this man, alike thy foe and mine? Alm. Their fortress I assail'd, they spar'd my life; The sire of this brave man unclasp'd my chains, The wife of this brave man spake comfort to me, And when I seem'd in sorrow, look'd on me As one who views a brother. Zam. Zama saw Distress, nor ask'd when misery pierc'd her soul, Whether a friend or foe requir'd relief: 'Twas human nature suffer'd, Zama pitied. Spaniard, beneath our roof, in Cuzco's walls, The life of man is sacred. Piz. [to Almagro.] You did promise To free this chief. Alm. My life for his is pledg'd. Piz. Say, we release him, you require no more. Alm. Nought, but our right, the Emperor's grant. Juan enters. Juan. Pizarro, The beck'ning signal waves from yonder fort. Shall I array the troops? Piz. Haste, quickly arm them. I, I will lead them. [Juan goes. Alm. Trust not to that signal. Piz. You plead the Emperor's grant! behold my title, Not penn'd in characters that man can forge, Make and unmake at will. [Takes his helmet off.] 'Tis charter'd here, Imprinted by the iron hand of war, On this time-furrow'd front: and till thy sword Has raz'd it out, look not to rule at Cuzco. Each dent, and honour'd scar that seams this head, Will yawn afresh, wide as when first the blood Gush'd from the wound, whene'er Pizarro yields What conquest gave him on the well-fought field. Here ends our conference. Guard! confine this Indian. END OF ACT THE SECOND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Court before the Temple of the Sun. Villoma and Zama. Zama. Oh! go not forth; to others trust the charge: 'Tis not a woman's fear: each voice reports Signs of dire portent. Vil. Earth has rock'd ere now, And red volcanos roar'dâ Zama. Not these alone, Nor lakes that heav'd when not a light leaf wav'd, Nor fiery armies clanging in the skies: But from the southern turret one who watch'd Last nightâ [Priests burst in. Priest. Hear, hear, Villomaâ Vil. Why thus burst Unbidden? Wherefore shake thy limbs? Priest. Good father! Vil. Speak, holy manâ Priest. It was our charge this day, To watch the heav'ns: noon's solemn hour drew near, When, as we gaz'd observant of the God, To hymn his mid-day pomp, at once from view, While not a cloud obscur'd the golden sky, The sun withdrew his light: and wide o'er heav'n From the dark orb thick gathering vapours spread Ceaselessly streaming. As our hearts died in usâ Oh horror! Vil. Speakâ Priest. The temple's ponderous gates Mov'd by an unseen hand, and dreadful groans, As from a struggling spirit loath to part, Burst from the riven shrineâ Zama. These, these are sent Dire warnings from above. Oh, go not forth. Vil. At this dread hour when treason shakes the realm, And brother against brother arms his hand, I will not to another trust that charge Which duty binds on me. The will of heaven, More audible than prodigies and portents, Bids me defend my country. Orcas enters. Orc. Haste, Villoma! The secret signal floats above the rock: Now, mid the traitors, in the cavern's gloom Where the sun never shone, Gulaxa leagues The murderous band. Vil. Say, are th'appointed guard Drawn forth, and well advis'd? Orc. They wait thy word, And call on thee to lead them. [Orcas goes. Vil. Say, I comeâ Thou, if this hand, oh Sun, that clasps thy shrine, Has ne'er from youth to age been rais'd to thee But to invoke from heav'n, on all beneath, Thy universal blessings, hear my pray'r! Accept this life, a sacrifice for all! Strike here, and save thy realm!âMy child, farewell! Zama. I will not leave thee at this dreadful hour: Zamorin's wife has sway among the chiefs, Zamorin's spirit breath'd in softer tone, E'en in a woman's voice has pow'r to daunt The soul of guilt. Vil. Think of thy boding fearsâ Zama. I have no fear: thy life, thy life's in danger. [Exeunt. Scene, a Cave. Gulaxa, Rimac, Conspirators. Gul. Your stations are assign'd, and ye have sworn What time Pizarro's trumpet rends the air To yield the fortressâ Rim. Yes, 'tis sworn, Gulaxa, But where is Arcal? Gul. On the middle rampire That skirts the ledge of rocks, his eye o'erlooks The Spanish camp. Rim. Trust not that man, Gulaxa: His life, methinks, is bosom'd in Villoma, That he so fears to wound himâ Villoma, Zama, Orcas, Guard, burst in. Vil. Seize their weapons. Rim. Noânot if this avail. Zama. [catching his lifted hand.] Here, traitor! strike.â A daughter's hand has sav'd thee. [To Villoma. Vil. Drag them forth, Drag forth these serpents from their darksome cave: Th'all seeing sun shall glare upon their shame. [They drag them forth. Traitors, your doom is death. Kneel not to me. [To Gulaxa. I cannot pardon thee. Gul. Nor do I ask it, But on such terms as shall redeem my soul From galling infamy. I boldly claim Not mercy, but high praise, and just reward Due to a deed that to remotest time Shall consecrate my memory. Vil. Say on. Gul. The signal waves; the Spaniards soon will march: I know the impatience of Pizarro's soul: That chief will lead them. At the lower fort Fix me to guide his foot-step up the rock: Then, ere he cross the outward bridge, this hand Shall pierce his breast. Zama. Oh more than serpent fell, He only wounds, instinctively, in rage, The foot that bruises him: but thou, oh man! Thou with deliberate thought, pondering the means, Would'st stab the friend who leans upon thy breast, And fell him with thy hand, held forth in act Of seeming kindness. Vil. And for this thou claim'st Praise and reward: such recompense as suits Such actions, be thy meed. When guilt, like thine, Stalks forth unpunish'd, he who pardons it Incurs the wrath of heav'n. Thy doom is death. Orc. [looking out.] Almagro's son, who left this morn our walls, Returnsâand with himâoneâ Zama. PerhapsâZamorin. Vil. [To Orcas who goes out.] Conduct them hither. Oh! all gracious heav'n! Thro' dark and intricate mazes hid from man Thy mercy lightens, as the golden sun Bursts from the veil of clouds. Orcas enters, conducting Almagro and Herrada. Zama. It is notânoâ 'Tis not Zamorin. Why that look of woe? [To Almagro. Why art thou silent? oh! he is no more. Alm. I left him living: butâyou see me hereâ Zama. I understand you. He will not live long. Alm. I left him at the mercy of Pizarro. Oh, if thou wish to hear his last farewell, Or see him more, away: this chief [Herrada.] shall guard thee. Rely on him, as on this willing victim, Pledg'd for Zamorin's life. Gul. [as Zama is rushing out.] Stay, Zama, stay! But grant me life, [to Villoma.] and I will mark the means To free the hostage. To her heart again Zama shall clasp her lord. Vil. Speakâthou art pardon'd. Gul. [pointing to Almagro.] Lo, in this chief, Pizarro's fellest foe: The wish most harbour'd in Pizarro's heart, Is this man's death: haste, proffer in exchange His corse, and hail Zamorin. Zama. Noâfell traitor! First, let Zamorin die, and with him, Zama. [To Herrada.] Spaniard! in thee I trust. My sireâfarewell. [Zama rushes out, accompanied by Herrada. Vil. Haste, haste, restrain her flightâmy daughter: Zama! Perfidious murderer! [to Gulaxa.] No. Thou shalt not die: It now were mercy. When Pizarro, swol'n With pride of promis'd victory, leads his host Against this fort, and summons forth his slaves, Thenâto confound the conqueror, cast before him This traitorâchain'd. So in thy doom, that chief Shall dread his destiny. [To Orcas.] Be this thy charge. [Exeunt. Scene changes to Pizarro's Camp. Pizarro comes from his Tent, at the sound of Trumpets at a distance. Piz. Here will I cross their marchâ By Saint Iago, Would that smooth sounds, or words of lofty tone Might cool these fiery spirits! 'till yon rock Barr'd my free progress, their resistless course Swept o'er Peru, from realm to conquer'd realm, Following from the east on Victory's eagle wing The sun, that like a harbinger before us, Lit our long march of glory. [a trumpet.] Harkâa trumpet! The sound of men in arms. Lerma and his Host enter Ler. Pizarro. Piz. Lerma! Ler. Pedro de Lerma. [lifting up his vizor.] Look upon him. Halt! Comrades in arms! Piz. Brave warrior! at this hour Why cas'd in steel with these thy valiant men? No herald summon'd thee. Ler. I march, Pizarro, To join Almagro's standard. Some have fled Like men, guilt-sham'd, as if they fear'd thy frown. I come, as chief meets chief, as foe fronts foe, To say that thou hast wrong'd me. Piz. Noâbrave warrior. Ler. How. Thou remember'st not? The injurer Can smile on whom he wrong'd, and calmly tender His hand in pledge of friendship! Say, Pizarro, Hast thou forgot the memorable day, When swol'n by autumn floods, th'Apurimac Barr'd our pursuit? when, on its crags, your host Shrunk back, and nought was heard, when paus'd the gust, But the flood's ceaseless roar, who, foremost, spurr'd His steed careering on the pendulous bridge, Which, o'er the torrent, wreath'd from rock to rock, Shook its light net-work waving with each wind? Piz. 'Tis fresh in my remembrance. Valiant Lerma, Thy steed first cross'd it. Ler. You remember that! Thenâwhen the Indians ambush'd 'mid the cliffs, Fell on our struggling rear, you bad Henriquez Charge with the lances. Was not that my post? Piz. I saw thee not. Ler. The routed Indians saw me, Who hemm'd Alvarez round: I rescued him: And heard, at my return, Henriquez' name Echoed from rank to rank. Piz. Forget th'offence. Since then long time has past, and Lerma's merits Have not been unrewarded. Ler. Years on years Heal not the wound where injur'd honour bled; Once felt, and ne'er forgotten. So, farewell. You know this raven plume, that oft in fight Has wing'd your troops to victory: Pizarro, Avoid it, and beware of Lerma wrong'd! Piz. Farewell, stern Lerma, nor forget this blade When it unplumes thy helm. Avoid Pizarro! [They part different ways. Scene changes to another part of Pizarro's Camp. Zamorin. Zam. The stir and shout of the tumultuous camp Loud ring from tent to tent: ere-long yon fort, Impregnable by pow'r of mortal arm, Shall yield its strength, and treason ope its gates At stern Pizarro's voice. Oh heav'n-born babe! Sole relic of the race sent down to earth To bless this realm! no more my arm shall guard thee. VillomaâZamaâhold my madd'ning brain! Not thatânot thatânoâthe fixt earth shall first Fall from it shatter'd base: and thou, oh Sun, Rush from thy sphere, ere guilt's foul touch pollute Her pure and sinless bosom. [Juan's voice heard without. Juan. When the trumpet Summons the warriors, to Pizarro lead them: Now strictly guard the tent: let none approach. Zama speaks in entering. Zamorin! Zam. 'Tis her voice. It cannot be. Once, once again charm'd Fancy! breathe that sound! Zama. [embracing him.] Zamorin. Zam. 'Tis herselfâangel of light. Zama. Yet, yet thou liv'st, and these fond arms enfold thee. Oh I had fear that never, never more This eye had gaz'd on thine. Zam. YesâI will clasp thee, And, ere we part, in thy celestial look Taste the pure transport of a world, where love 'Mid spirits of the blest, links soul with soul In everlasting union. Yetâmy Zama! I would we had not met. Zama. Oh say not that! Zam. Why gaze thus on me with unsated eye? Zama. Oh! thou art strangely alter'd, since we parted. A few, few days. Keen grief has wrung thy soul, And each worn feature, as I gaze on thee, Wounds me with mute reproach. Had I been here, Thou had'st less keenly suffer'd. Zam. That alone, I had but that alone to sooth my anguish: Thou knew'st it notâ Zama. Yet, sure, had I been here, Thy soul, tho' pierced with anguish, had found peace While pillow'd on my breast thy brow repos'd. And I had watch'd thy sleep, and if my tears Shed in mute wretchedness, had chanc'd to stray Down thy pale cheek, my lip had kiss'd them off, And met thee with a smile. Zam. The past, oh Zama! Wakes not a pang. Would thou wert now away! Zama. Never, Zamorin, will I leave thee more: None, none shall part us. Thou wert once unkind, Yet was it kindly meant! but never more Force me to quit thee: nor dissolve the dream So sweet, of hope, that whispers to my soul That I may sooth thy grief. Alas! Zamorin, You hid from me the woe that nature suffers, But left me to the nameless agonies Of fear's unreal shapings. Yetâmy husbandâ Zam. Why that dread silence? Speak thy inmost wish. Zama. The fond indulgence of a woman's weakness Must not unman thee: these are ruthless men; And, if thou deem, that death's unpitied pangs Will less severely wound thee, if thy Zama Be far away: I, now, tho' loth, will leave thee. And, yet, mid these rude men, whose brutal rage Ends not with lifeâ Zam. Cease, cease: you wring my heart. Zama. To leave thy untomb'd corse expos'd to scorn And insults that the tongue wants strength to utter! Oh by that love which made this earth a heav'n, By the blest vow that made us one, refuse not My last request!â Zam. I was prepar'd for death: Thou hast unman'd me: 'tis for thee I fear. Zama. Thou weep'st, nor longer can'st deny my pray'r: 'Tis what religion prompts, and these bad men, Unhallow'd as they are, will not refuse it. 'Tis but to close the eye which cannot see The hand that weighs it down, and smooth the brow Insensate to the touch which presses it. Nor will they envy me a little spot Where I may hide thee in the grave, and pour O'er thy cold corse a pray'r, while death steals o'er The lip that breathes farewell. [Trumpet sounds. Zam. Hark! that dread signal! Juan enters with a Guard. Juan. Bring the Peruvians forth. Zam. Art thou prepar'd, My Zama? Zama. Yes, Zamorin, thusâ[embraces him.] to perish, And hail the stroke that shall in death unite us. END OF ACT THE THIRD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Fort of Cuzco. Pizarro, Alvarados, Benalcazar, Zamorin, Zama. Soldiers arrayed. Piz. Comrades in arms! Who here have watch'd, while through each labouring change The cold moon slowly toil'd, and at the base Of these vast rocks, seen the red balls ye launch'd Fall from the unscath'd fortress! Ye, whom war, By irksome trials in the lingering seige Has taught to bear the iron yoke that galls Proud valour, while your spirit glow'd within you, Like the train'd war-steed, balancing his pace While his eye flames with fire; lo, there your spoils! [Pointing to the Fort. Drag from unfathom'd caves exhaustless wealth, And jems that pale the noon-beam: on yon height Repose, and one by one tell o'er your scars: And where the arrow pierc'd your batter'd mail, Close it with plates of goldâ Ben. Now, give the signalâ Thy troops demand the spoil. Piz.

[to his herald.] Sound the trumpet. Summon the fortress. Alv. First, Pizarro, hear meâ This corselet bears the dint of many a wound That bought thee conquest: gold and gems I ask not. I claim his freedom. Zama. Thou wert born of woman, And drops of pity mingled in the breast That gave thee milk. Alv. [to Zama.] Hang not around me, thus; Mine is no heart of flint: since she who bore me, Wept o'er her farewell blessing, this old cheek Has never felt a tear: the drops would scald My eye unwonted to themâ Ben. Hear, Pizarro, Our followers murmur at this long delayâ Alv. [to Ben.] When Alvarados speaks, he will be heardâ In the last action, when his army fled, I found this Inca with the fight o'erdone Stretch'd on a heap, Indians and Spaniards slain. I bad him yield: he answer'd not, but swiftly As one just fresh in onset, wrench'd my lance From its firm rest: and, as I grasp'd my sword, With my own weapon, thro' this iron gauntlet, Thus, pierc'd me: and may venom lurk in the wound, If Alvarados see him basely slain As he had ne'er known valour. Zama. [kisses his hand.] Zama's lip Shall head the woundâ Piz. [to Alv.] Pizarro is thy debtor. When the proud fortress yields, release the hostage. Summon the placeâ Zam. [advancing.] Pizarro, stayâThat fort Hangs on my word: be warn'd, and now release me: Or rage will prompt strange deeds, which shall outlast The fame that waits on victoryâPeru Once more in arms demands her chief: release him, Him whom you cannot fearâ Ben. Free him, Pizarroâ Our scanty band scatters at will their myriads Like dust before the blastâ Zam. Boast not, proud warrior! We are not cas'd in mail, we forge not swords Edg'd to cut steel, we launch not hidden fires That flash, and man is dead, nor mount on steeds That crush the foe beneath their iron hoofâ We fight, as nature dictates: ye are train'd To slaughter as an art: and in mid fight Ye speak, and are obey'd, and turn the tide Of battle with a word. But, with our shields Twin'd rushes of the brook, reed shafts, and spears Unbarb'd with iron, and for high-plum'd casque A wreath of flow'rs pluck'd from our native soil, Arm'd in our country's cause, we will once more Front you without a fearâ Ben. [to Piz.] These valiant men Have earn'd rewards beyond a monarch's ransom, And claim the promis'd spoil. We come not hither Thus to be mock'd by slaves. Piz. Draw your brave swords, Wave your triumphant standards, peal the trumpet. Yield to Pizarro's power! Orc. [on the battlement.] Where is the chief Who thrones and unthrones kings? Piz. [advancing.] Behold Pizarroâ Orc. [to the guards within the fort.] Now cast the traitor forth, then, close the gates. [Gulaxa is cast forth. He kneels to Pizarro. Ben. This is no harbinger of victory. Alv. [to Gul.] Why dost thou clasp his knees? why prone on earth Thus shrouded close from view, as if thou fear'd'st That the abhorrent eye should turn from thee As from a sight unblest? Zam. Is this the monarch Whom great Pizarro crown'd? Piz. Ye mountains! crush me! Gape earth that I have drench'd with blood, and hide me In central night! Ben. [to Pizarro.] Where are the promis'd spoils? Piz. [confusedly to his army.] This is not as it seems. It moves your wonder. Be not alarm'd, my friends: art oft beneath The semblance of repulseâOh heav'n and earth! By all my former fame, and the proud hope Of greater glory, now for ever gone, Thou [to Gulaxa.] shalt not live. [Going to stab him. Gul. Stay thy impetuous hand: I was myself betray'd. Send back your troops. Yet, yet thou shalt succeed. Piz. Comrades! retire A little while: here soon to meet again. I pray you to the camp. [All go but Pizarro, Juan, and Gulaxa. Gul. Grant me but life, Villoma shall obey me. Piz. Mark me, traitor, Ohâif false hope deceive me, thou shalt die In lingering agonies. There, fix my banners, Now, ere Almagro's swift advancing host Pluck conquest from my grasp. Gul. 'Tis in thy pow'r. Piz. No trifle turns Pizarro from his course. Gul. You need but feign the act. Piz. Be briefâreveal itâ Gul. You mark'd that woman whom they lead away. Piz. Most beautiful. In form, and face, and air, Peerless, and rarely grac'd. Gul. You know her rank. Piz. Zamorin's wife. Gul. Know you nought else? Zam. No more. Gul. She is a daughter of the sun: a Coya. Piz. [impatiently.] Well, well. Gul. You heed me not. She is a Coya. Pure in her veins, from our first monarch, flows Her blood by mortal mixture unprofan'd. Her father, in yon rock-built temple, serves The sun, his sire and god,âher life is sacredâ You understand me: let me add no more. Piz. Her life is sacred. I have heard such tales; But these vain dreams and visions of weak fancies, Past with the hearing. Gul. Oh you misconceive it: So sacred are their lives, that he who wounds them Unknowingly, nay, tho' devoid of sense, Idiot or lunatic, no longer dwells With man, but from the social tie cut off, Strays lone on earth, amid the beasts of the wild. Who slays a Coya, is entomb'd alive, His race from earth swept off, and e'en the ground That fed him, hid with stones, which he who passes, Casts with a curse upon it. Piz. Thenâyou mean That I should slay this daughter of the sun, If her stern sire refuse to yield the fort. Gul. You need but threaten it. But ne'er Villoma Will yield the fort, unsanction'd by Zamorin. A solemn vow restricts him. Free the hostage: Let him once more to Cuzco's walls return; And when Villoma and Zamorin view The Coya in thy pow'râ Piz. [interrupting him.] It cannot failâ Juanâdelay notâto Zamorin haste; Release the hostage: this the sole condition, That young Almagro in yon walls remain A captive: here, with us, the Coya rests, Pledge of Zamorin's words. [Juan goes.] Guards! seize this traitor, [Gulaxa.] And underneath yon rock that view'd our shame, In torturing pangs inflict his doom of death. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Camp. Zamorin and Zama. Zam. Oh hapless country! by thy native race Betray'd to merciless men! Zama. Yet some remain Unshaken: from the rest, when thou went'st forth, Hope fled: from thee the general spirit flow'd As light from heav'n. Thy influence reign'd in all; Thou wert their voice in counsel, strength in war, In woe, sole prop: thou went'st, and dark despair Fell on the brave: while strange extravagant tales That made the Spaniards, gods, found sure belief In the base fear that forg'd them. Zam. Lost Peru! Oh could they hear my voice! e'en now, ere night, Spaniards 'gainst Spaniard, arm'd by demons, clash In unforgiving contest. Knew they this, Hope would revive, and with reviving hope, Th'unconquerable will, and pow'r to quell Th'invader. Oh! how gladly would I pour My willing blood upon my native earth, If my blest voice, in death, might warn Peru Of fate to come! Juan enters. Juan. Zamorin, thou art free: Go to yon fort, and as becomes the brave, Defend thy country. Zam. Gracious heav'n! I thank thee! Yet much I fear thou mock'st me. Juan. Thou art free. Yetâhear the terms. Zam. I knew that thou did'st mock me. You need not name them. Juan. Had thy will consented To young Almagro's death, the western world Had own'd thy rule. Zama. He came, a willing victim Pledg'd for thy life. [Zamorin.] By his kind aid I stand Here at thy side. Zam. You may depart. Juan. Yetâhear me: Nor price of blood, nor aught unjust I claim: This only, to detain him in yon fort A prisoner: Zama, hostage for thy word Here, in our guard, remains. [after a long pause.] You answer not. Zama. Yes. He consents. Oh, linger not, Zamorin. Away, [aside to Zamorin.] and warn Peru of fate to come. Farewell. Zam. Oh man! thou hadst not hope to move me. Juan. I understand thee not. Zam. Then briefly this, We love our wives, and in that name comprise All that earth holds most sacred. Thou art answer'd. Zama. Good Spaniard! I may move him: pray retire. [Juan goes. [After a long silence.] You will consent. Zam. Never. Zama. You love me not. Zam. Far beyond life. Zama. More than thy country's freedom, Than virtue, self-esteem, vows fix'd in heav'n, That vow, which when Huascar's spirit fled, Left on his corse a smile? thee I have lov'd With that pure ardour, which to rightly name it, Seems likest adoration: for in thee, Virtue in human shape, gave me on earth The foretaste of hereafter. I have liv'd In that persuasion blest: so let me die. Oh say, you will consent. Zam. Art thou aware Of their intent? Zama. I think I shall not live. Zam. 'Tis plain as if Pizarro's voice proclaim'd it: Thee, they will drag thee underneath the fort, And in a father's sightâ Zama. [interrupting him.] Oh name it not. Zam. The fiend will pierce thy bosom, if Villoma Refuse to yield the fort. Zama, a father Can ne'er endure that sight. Zama. Thou wilt be with him: Control himâand thenâsooth him, that he feel not That he has lost a child. Zam. How shall I stand Unshaken, when a father's heart drops blood? Zama. Thou art the column that supports Peru. Zam. It is thy voice, but thou hast chang'd thy nature. Thy eye, that gazes on me, sheds no tear, While mineâ Zama. Spare, pity me, consent, farewell. Zam. Is it a trivial thing to part with life, That we no more shall meet as once in bliss? Zama. Husband! clasp, clasp me in thy arms, then ask That question, and my heart shall answer thee. Thus, [embracing him.] we will die together. YetâI fear Peru's deep curse will load our parting breath. Zam. Thou more than woman. Zama. No, a weak, frail woman, Who has not chang'd her nature: one, from love Who borrows strength beyond her pow'r, to utter What breaks her heart. Say, that we live, Zamorin, And yield the fort; the earth will groan beneath us; The sun withdraw his light that we have hymn'd, Both when it rose and set; for still it blest Our love, whose bond was virtue. We may shun A scornful world: how shall we shun ourselves, The worse despisers? Say, we die together; My father to redeem our corse from insult Would yield the fort, butâas he tomb'd our bones, Shame would suspend his blessing. Fix our doom: My soul, high-strain'd beyond its nature, leans On thee for aid: oh, by thy virtue, husband, Give strength to mine. Oh let me die in peace, And make my memory blest. [Rushes out, but returns. Zam. Farewellâbe blestâ Yetâyet. I have a fear. How shall I speak it? these are bad, bad men. When he, who should protect, is far away, When most his aid is wantedâ Zama. Spous'd in heav'n! Let not a fear for me disturb thee more! I can protect myselfâdepart in peace! Zam. What thy intent? Zama. Ere the good Spaniard went, Who brought me hither, I entreated him One favour for Almagro's sake: he gave it: Uncertain as I was what doom might wait me, I begg'd this steel. I will not rashly use it. But when all else shall fail, 'twill be no crime To rescue a pure daughter of the sun, Thy wife, from touch unblest. Zam. [embraces her.] We meetâin heav'n. END OF ACT THE FOURTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Sanctuary of the Temple of the Sun. On each side of the Sun, blazing over his Altar, the embalmed bodies of the Peruvian Emperors, from Manco Capac their first Sovereign, seated on golden thrones. Villoma, Zamorin, Peruvian Chiefs. Vil. Defenders of your country! Approach, and on this bloodless altar lay Your hands, the plighted witness of your vow. Peruv. We lay our handsâ Vil. Now vow ye will perform Whate'er Zamorin urges. Peruv. Hear our vow! Zam. [to Vil.] Thy duty now is o'er. Oh holy father! Retire, I pray thee. On their souls I bind A dreadful charge: their country's freedom claims it: A charge of blood, whose utterance were unfit For thy pure ear. [Vil. departs. Zam. Defenders of Peru! Who here in awful ecstasy adore High wonders ne'er expos'd to eyes on earth Save the Sun's hallow'd race: ye, whom pure zeal, And that great cause which consecrates your vow, The freedom of your country, here unites In holiest league: by him, who on yon [Manco Capac.] throne, Now o'er you bends, the founder of our country, Who from their rocks first drew our sires, and tam'd To social life, when lone, dispers'd, they wander'd O'er earth's wide wilderness, where man and beast Grappled for nature's sov'reignty: by him Who first unclos'd the unaccustom'd heart To pity, tenderness, and gentle joys, Who to the woods and wilds brute passion chas'd, And taught the interchange of soul with soul, And sympathies of kin that make on earth Each home a blissful heav'n:âBy Him, my voice Adjures you, to resist the fell invader, Or with your realm, religion, freedom, laws, In one wide wreck expireâ Peruv. We will resist Or perish.âLead us forthâ Zam. No, not to war; 'Tis not to battle that I urge you forth, To combat with a foe whom hell has arm'd With its own fires.âThey told you they were Gods: You found them hid beneath their iron mail Men sensible of pain; and I have found them Men viler than the beast that roams the wild. Hear, and rejoice, and hymn the song of praise: Ere night, their hosts by rival chieftains arm'd In merciless combat meet. Thou stand, Peru, Aloof, and when th'exhausted victor mourns His conquest, sweep from earth that groans beneath them The wretched remnant of these Gods distain'd With kindred murder. Peruv. On their head our vengeance! Zam. Be firm; ye must endure a dreadful test: I cannot speak it. Yet, whate'er ye view, E'en tho' Villoma in the dust before you Strew his grey hairs, and pray you spare his age: E'en tho' the chief whose charge now binds your souls, Should, slave of human frailty deny The oath that past his lip, swear ye will guard The fort till death.âVow this, or now resign Your lives, your liberty, your king, your God, At fell Pizarro's word. Peruv. Our oath is fix'd. Zam. Then ye are conquerorsânow, friends! farewellâ Each to his separate charge, and guard the gates, Lest rous'd to frantic agony, Peru Burst them, and yield the fortressâ Peruv. We have vow'dâ [Peruvian chiefs depart. Zam. [falls on the altar.] Oh thou, who view'st the heart! thou, to whom thought Speaks without tongue; to thee is no disguise. Therefore, accept for incense, this deep sigh; For sacrifice, these tears wrung from the heart And streaming on thy shrine. These now may fall Blameless, unseen of man. Yet, not the less Sustain me to th'accomplishment, and fill With dauntless force, that in thy cause my soul May triumph: and when free Peru shouts forth The hymn of praise, rejoin my bride in heav'n! [Exit. Scene changes to Pizarro's Camp. Pizarro, Alvarados, Soldiers. Piz. [to Alv.] Speed, speed, brave chief! the field may yet be ours. Lead forth thy charge, and, as the foe ascends Yon mound, where our brisk cannon shall confound them, Assail them unawaresâ Benalcazar enters. Well, Benalcazar! Ben. Candia contemns thy offer; he is gone, With him his valiant pikemenâ Piz. Then, brave chiefs, We shall have more to conquer. Haste, Alvarez: Bring Zama hitherâ Alv. What now thy intent I do not look to fathom; but, bewareâ 'Tis loudly rumour'd thro' th'unquiet camp That from yon fort releas'd, Almagro's son Heads his fleet squadrons. All, with eager voice Count and recount his force, and, as fear reckons, Swell them at every numb'ringâ Piz. Brave Castillians! The lion counts not when he thins the herdâ On you brave chiefs, Pizarro's glory rests: Lead forth your separate charges. [Alvarados and Benalcazar go. Zama enters. Zama, say, If Cuzco saw beneath her sacred walls A daughter of the Sun, and o'er her breast The quivering dagger gleam, in act to strike, Would not thy race to rescue her from death Resign the fort, and hail with grateful shout The foe who spar'd her life? Zama. A crime so fell Would draw down fire from heav'nâ Piz. Thou art the victim, And Iâ[Zama kneels.] kneel not to me: beneath yon walls Urge thy request. Thy race are prone to pity: A father, and a husband will avert The threaten'd deedâ Zama. They will not yield the fortress. A daughter of the Sun now bows before thee, Who ne'er has bow'd the knee to mortal man. Grant my requestâ Piz. Thy life depends on themâ Zama. Of life I have no hope: I urge no pray'r That thou, Pizarro, may'st not justly grant. I shall not live: nor will Zamorin long Survive my loss: but it will sooth Villoma, And seem like shew of solace to his tears That they are shed upon his daughter's corse. He is a time-worn man, bow'd by sore grief, And ere he close my last sad rites, he too May rest with me. He is a holy man, And heav'n till now has smil'd upon his pray'r; Grant this, and if indulgent Heav'n will hear The voice of one who for her murderer pleads, Pangs less severe in death's dread hour shall rack Thy struggling spirit. A Spanish Chief enters. Chief. As the gale comes on, An intermingled noise of neighing steeds, And troops that shout to battle, mark the advance Of fierce Almagro's force. Juan enters. Juan. Haste, Pizarroâ Summon Zamorin: bid him yield the fort, Or view his Zama perishâ Piz. Speed, brave Juan, Lead forth my chosen guard, and, if avail Or skill or courage, yet awhile resist Almagro's numbers.âZama, to yon fort. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Fort. Zamorin and Almagro in a watch-tower. Zam. Look o'er yon rising mound. Again they rally: Again they charge the foe, and bravely combat As men who fear not deathâ Alm. No more detain meâ You sav'd my life, for you my blood shall flow: Mine to confront the danger, yours alone The fruits of victory. Zam. On either wing They hem them round, and bear down all before them. See, from your numerous squadrons, once again Their routed lances flyâ Alm. Another troop Rush from the camp: the men who fled but now Turn back on their pursuers. Steed on steed Confus'dly clash, and mix in doubtful fight. I will not tamely see my warriors slain: Detain me not: this arm shall turn the battle: This arm shall rescue Zama. Zam. No, brave knight, My word is pledg'd: I trust th'event to Heav'nâ But no false word shall stain Zamorin's lipâ Ah! who yon chief? [a trumpet is heard. Piz. [behind the scenes.] Zamorin. Zam. Hold, my heart! 'Tis he: 'tis fierce Pizarro, to these walls Swift he advances. Aid me, Heav'n! Pizarro, Zama, Spanish Chiefs, Soldiers, enter. Piz. [entering.] Villoma, Zamorin, yield the fort, or now the Coya Bleeds in your sight. Peruvians! yield the fort, Or now the sacred daughter of the Sun Pollutes with blood your consecrated walls. [Villoma, Zamorin, Almagro, Peruvian Chiefs, People, &amp;c. rush to the lower battlements.] Vil. My childâmy child! Zam. Sustain me now, oh Sun! Remember, chiefs! your vow: keep back the throng! Piz. [standing over Zama with his drawn dagger.] Consent, or now she dies. Vil. Hear! Pizarro! Draw back the steel: the fort, the fort is thine. Release me from my vow! [to Zamorin.] it is thy wife, It is thy wife, Zamorin! hear, Peruvians! Her blood be on your head: the Sun's pure blood! By these grey hairs! I kneel to you, my children. Oh spare a wretched father, spare my age. I have but her. [Villoma faints. Zam. Convey him from the walls. Chiefs. [to Zamorin.] Release us from our oaths. People. Oh horror! horror! Come onâforce back the bars. Resist us not. [To the Chiefs. Pizarro! sheath thy blade: we yield the fort. Piz. Haste, soldiers! fix your standards on yon walls. Zama. There is no other aid. Zamorin, turn Thy eyes away. [going to stab herself, is prevented by Pizarro.] Oh feeble arm! Piz. Peruvians, Unbar the gates, or now the Coya dies. Voices without.] Almagro! victory, victory, Almagro! Orgognez rushes in with Almagro's conquering army. Alm. Pizarro, free the Coya, or thou diest. Piz. [his lifted dagger in act to strike.] Nayâif thou threaten. Benalcazar and Alvarados, brought in Prisoners and wounded. Benalcazar, bleeding! Thou too, [to Alvarados.] disarm'd? Alv. His forces o'ermatch'd ours. Alm. Hear, Pizarro! Release her, or thou diest, and these thy chiefs Perish in lingering agonies: restore her, And in exchange receive their ransom'd lives. Piz. And may I trust to thee? Alm. [to Orgognez.] Brave chief, release them. Alv. [after being released.] Free her, or Alvarados joins Almagro. Piz. [sheaths his dagger, and frees Zama.] Pizarro knows thy worth. Alm. Descend, Zamorin, Thy firmness has prevail'd. In friendly league, Beneath Almagro's pow'r, bear rule o'er Cuzco. Butâif the league with Spaniards seem offence, Almagro shall confirm Pizarro's word. I will relieve the fort: thou, arm Peru: The rest is Heav'n's. Now, bid the gates unclose: Descend, and from a Spaniard's hand receive Thy peerless bride! [The gates are flung open, Zamorin descends. Zam. Spaniard! in thee I trust. Zama. [They rush into each other's arms.] Thou more than mortal! Zama. My Zamorin! Zam. Once more, once more on earth we shall be blest. And thou, [to Almagro.] who hast redeem'd the name of Spaniard From ever-during guilt, hear the last sound That from Zamorin's voice shall reach thy ear, Till in the van of battle, front to front, Each leading on his host to death or conquest, Our shouts immingle. Hear me praise thy virtue, While I renounce thy friendship. We are foes. Ye have destroy'd my country, have defac'd A realm on whose untam'd fertility The sun look'd kindly down, and prosperous show'rs Pour'd forth perpetual harvests: ye have outrag'd A people, whom content, and peace, and love, Had bound in purest bliss, that gave to man In this terrestrial paradise, the pledge Of heav'n's assur'd beatitude. Oh, stranger! This race, this realm, this paradise, your steel And ruthless flame have wasted: I oppos'd: Nor shall this arm, till death relax its vigour, Fail to avenge the outrage. Can you say, âForgive the offence, be it no more remember'd?â Go, gather up your host. Hence, as you came: And when th'unfathomable deep that severs Our hostile worlds, rolls all its strength between us: And when our blissful brides, who ne'er have heard The name of Spaniard, to their bosoms press A new-born race: and new-born flow'rs and fruits Hide every spot whereon your foot found rest, You are forgiven. Till that day, Zamorin Feeds in his heart just vengeance. Nowâfarewell. THE END.</field>
