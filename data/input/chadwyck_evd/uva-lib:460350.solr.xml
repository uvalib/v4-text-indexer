      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCEN. I. Sabina and Julia. SABINA. Excuse my weakness, and my grief permit In that distress, which so much merits it: When such a storm does its approaches make, It may become the strongest heart to shake; And Constancy will now admit dispute, Ev'n in the Breast that is most resolute: But yet how rude so'ere the shock appears, Though not my Sighs, I can command my Tears; Though so much sorrow may my heart surprize, Yet Vertue still is regent in my Eyes: If to my heart, I can confine my woe, Though less than Man, I more than Woman do. To stop my tears in an assault so rough, For our weak Sex will sure be brave enough. JULIA. It is for vulgar Souls I must confess, Who create grief from every slight distress; But a great Heart would blush at that defect, And all things dares from doubtful Fate expect: Under our Walls two Armies we survey, But Rome ne're yet knew how to lose the day; Applause, not grief, we to her Fortune owe, Who whilst she fights must needs the mightier grow. Then let vain terrours from your breast depart, And find out Vows worthy a Roman heart. SABINA. My heart I gave to Horace, and 'tis true, Since he's a Roman, I must be so too: But yet that Knot a Fetter would be thought, If my dear Country should be quite forgot. Alba where I began to see the light, Alba my native place, and first delight, When I behold a War 'twixt us and thee, As much as loss, I dread a Victory: Rome if by this thy anger I create, Find out a Foe whom I may justly hate; When at thy Walls two Armies in thy sight, Shew me my Brothers with my Husband fight, What Prayers can I make? how can I be Without impiety concern'd for thee? I know thy growing Empire, yet so young, By War alone must make her sinews strong; Thy future grandeur is by Fate design'd, Not to the Latines to be long confin'd: The gods the suppliant World for thee intend, And 'tis by Arms thou must attain that end: Far from repining at that noble heat Which serves thy Stars, and helps to make thee great; I wish thy Troops may still new Triumphs claim, And over-run Pyrenian Hills to Fame. Go, Eastern Conquests for thy Sword design, And settle thy Pavillions in the Rhine; Let all Lands tremble where thy Ensigns go, But her to whom thou Romulus dost owe; Subdue the utmost Regions of the Earth, But spare the Town where Romulus had birth; Forget not her from whom thy City draws, Her Name, and all her strength, but Walls and Laws: Alba's thy Parent, let that thought arrest Thy greedy Sword, nor pierce thy Mother's breast, For thy triumphant Arms make other choice, And in her Children's Fortune shee'll rejoice, Nay, would with natural concern disown All Enemies of thine, were she not one. JULIA. This Language much surprize to me affords, For since these Cities first unsheath'd their Swords, You have so unconcern'd for Alba stood, As if your birth had been of Roman blood; I wonder'd at a Vertue so refin'd, Which to your Husband, Alba had resign'd, And therefore so proportion'd my relief, As if our Rome alone had caus'd your grief. SABINA. Whilst such a shock my reason did assail, As was too weak to weigh down either Scale; Till all my flattering hopes of Peace were lost, To be entirely Roman was my boast. If at Rome's Fortune I displeas'd have been, I quickly chid that mutiny within: And when her destiny was not so kind, If, for my Brothers, joy seduc'd my mind, By Reason's help that motion I suppress'd, And wept for all the glory they possess'd. But now these Cities must be lost or sav'd, That Rome must sink, or Alba be enslav'd; And after battel there no hope remains To the subdu'd, nor stop to her that gains: I should too barbarously my Country treat, If I could be a perfect Roman yet. A little less to one man's love resign'd, To neither City I will be confin'd; I fear for both, and whilst their Fate is try'd, I still will be on the afflicted side; Equal to each, whilst they unequal are, And must their Grief, but not their Glory share. For I resolve in such a sharp debate, To mourn the Conquer'd, and the Victor hate. JULIA. How oft does Fortune with an equal blow, On different Souls different effects bestow! How distant is Camilla's way from this? Your Brother loves her, her's your Husband is, Yet in each Army with another eye, She can a Lover and a Brother spie: When in Rome's Fortunes you were most involv'd, She was as much confus'd and unresolv'd: She feard the storm from every cloud would spread, And the success of either side did dread: The most unfortunate she did bemoan, And whosoe're prevail'd she was undone. But when the day, she knew, was drawing nigh, And one great Battel should the Quarrel try, A sudden gladness breaking from her browâ SABINA. Ah Julia! how that joy allarms me now, Valerius yesterday she smil'd upon, And for his sake, she Curtius will disown; A nearer Object snatches her esteem, And two years absence hath deformed him! But though my Brother be to me so dear, By care of him, I must not injure her; My groundless jealousie concludes amiss, Who can change love at such a time as this? How can a heart, receive a wound that's new, When such great shocks give it so much to do? Yet from joy too, this fatal day deters, And from contentments which resemble hers. JULIA. In me it equal wonder does produce, Nor do I know what can be her excuse; 'Tis Constancy enough, if we can wait Without impatience so severe a Fate, But 'tis too much, if we shall chearful grow. SABINA. See some good Genius sends her hither now, Her thoughts on this, engage her to reveal, From you her Friendship nothing can conceal; I'le leave youâSister talk with Julia now, For I'm asham'd my weakness to avow; And so much sorrow does my heart invade, That I must hide it in some secret shade. Exit. SCEN. II. Julia, Camilla. CAMILLA. Why does she wish I should with you converse, Does she believe my trouble less than hers? Or more insensible of this sad day, Does she conclude I have no tears to pay? With equal terrour I am threaten'd too, And I shall lose as much as she can do: The man to whom I did my heart resign, Must for his Country die, or ruine mine: And all that I can love (such is my fate!) Must now deserve my sorrow or my hate. Alas!â JULIA. Yet her affliction is more strange, We may a Lover not a Husband change; Receive Valerius love, Curtius forget, And you'l no more the other side regret; But wholly Ours, and recompos'd within, You'l nothing have to lose, when Rome does win. CAMILLA. Ah give me Council more legitimate, Nor teach me with a Crime to shun my Fate; For though my tide of Woes I scarce can stem, I rather would endure than merit them. JULIA. Can you believe a prudent change a fault? CAMILLA. And can you think a Perjury is not? JULIA. What can engage us to our mortal foes? CAMILLA. But what can disengage what honour owes? JULIA. You would in vain disguise a thing design'd, And which Valerius yesterday did find; For the reception you to him did give, Hath made his late repining hope revive. CAMILLA. If to Valerius I then paid respect, You nothing thence must for his hope collect; Another subject did my joies produce, But I your errour now will disabuse; And for my Curtius keep a flame too sure, Such a suspicion longer to endure. You know his Sister was no sooner led, By happy marriage, to my Brother's Bed, But that my Father (prest by him) desir'd, I should reward the love I had inspir'd: That time produc'd happy and fatal things; At once our marriage, and the War resolv'd, Our hopes created, and those hopes dissolv'd; It promis'd all, and then snatch'd all away, It makes us Foes, and Lovers in a day: How violent our grief did then appear, How many blasphemies Heav'n then did hear, And from my Eyes how many Rivers fell, I tell you not, you saw our last farewell. The trouble of my Soul, you since have seen, And of my vows for Peace have witness been; At every news in my distracted breast, My Country and my Lover did contest; Toss'd with uncertain thoughts, I fled for ease To the relief of sacred Oracles: Judge if what yesterday I did obtain, Might not assure my drooping heart again; That famous Greek who at the Aventine dwells, And Heav'n's dark purposes to men foretels, He whom Apollo never yet betray'd, By this reply my stormy thoughts allay'd. âAlba and Rome to morrow changing face âShall to thy wish'd for peace at last give place; âAnd to thy Curtius thou shalt then be ty'd, âSo as no Fortune, ever shall divide. I wholly on this answer did depend And finding it my utmost hopes transcend, My Soul to raptures of Contentment flew, Beyond what happiest Lovers ever knew. Judge of their height; Valerius then I met, And could ev'n him behold without regret: He spoke of Love too, and I that could hear, And never thought Valerius had been there; His Courtship could from me no anger draw, For every thing seem'd Curtius that I saw. I thought all sounds told me how he did burn, And all my answers Eccho'd my return. The general Field which must to day be fought, I yesterday had heard, but minded not; My Soul those fatal Objects did reject, And still on peace and marriage did reflect: But Night those charming errours has expell'd, And made my Soul to dreadful Visions yield, Wherein vast heaps of horrour, Floods of Gore Did rob my Joy, and all my fear restore: I saw men dying, and then lost the sight, A Ghost appear'd, and then it took it's flight; The fatal shades, each others shape suppress, And by confusion terrour did increase. JULIA. An opposite construction dreams require. CAMILLA. I would believe what I so much desire; But I and all my hopes of good success Find this a day of Battel, not of Peace. JULIA. 'Twill end the War, and then a peace is sure. CAMILLA. The pain is less then such a guilty cure. If Rome, or Alba must defeated be, Dear Curtius can have no pretence to me; No it Camilla never can become To wed the Conquerour, or Slave of Rome. But what new Object does my sight surprize! Is it thee Curtius? may I trust my Eyes? SCEN. III. Curtius, Camilla, Julia. CURTIUS. Camilla doubt it not, that Man is come Neither the Conquerour, nor Slave of Rome; Nor think he could before your face have stood With Roman Fetters charg'd, or Roman blood. Glory and Rome, you love at such a rate, You would despise my chain, and Conquest hate; And since alike in an extream so great I fear'd a Victory, and a defeatâ CAMILLA. 'Tis enough Curtius, I can guess thy aim, Thou fly'st a Field so fatal to thy Flame; Rather then me, thy amorous heart would lose, It to thy Countrey does thy Sword refuse. Let others make reflections on thy Fame, And if they please, so great a passions blame; I can no quarrel have to this design, What most thy Love shews, most obliges mine: And if to Alba succour that denys, 'Tis to make me the greater Sacrifice. But hast thou seen my Father? and could he Allow his house should thy retirement be? Does Policy or Nature him o'recome? And which is dearest to him, me, or Rome? And to assure our Fortune let me know, Did he appear a Father, or a Foe? CURTIUS. With as much Kindness my approach he saw As could be challeng'd by a Son-in-Law: But me, he hath not by a treason seen, Which had unworthy his allyance been. I quit not Alba, by adoring you, But keep my passion, and my honour too; And all the War, your Curtius hath not been A better Lover then a Citizen; Nor to his Countries Cause could Love prefer, But whilest he sigh'd for you, he Fought for her. And if we must that sad contest renew, I still must fight for her, and sigh for you. Yes, and in spight of all my passions charms, Did the War last, I should be now in Arms. But a new Peace gives me this free access, And 'tis to that, we owe this happiness. CAMILLA. O! Who can faith to such a wonder give? JULIA. At least you may, your Oracle believe, And may discover by this good success, This day of battel ha's produc'd a peace. CURTIUS. Who could have thought it? the two Armys met, And Both to Fight resolv'd with equal heat, When our Dictator 'twixt both Armys stands, And a short audience from your Prince demands. âRomans (said he then) whence comes all this rage? âWhat fury makes us thus in Arms engage? âAt least let Reason our Instructor be, âOur daughters are your Wives, your Neighbors we; âHymen so much our union did pursue, âThat our Sons challenge Grand-Fathers in you: âWe but one Kinred, and one People are, âWhy should we tear our selves with Civil Wars? âWhere he that Conquers loses too, and wears âHis noblest Lawrel water'd with his Tears. âOur common Foes expect this Bloody Day, âThat they that win it, may become their Prey; âNor can the Guilty Conqu'rour that avoid, âHaving himself his own defence destroy'd. âThey smile to see us thus our Force abuse, âWhich against them we should more Nobly use: âLet us these little discords then forsake, âWhich so bad Kinsmen of good Souldiers make. âBut if a thirst of Empire be the Cause âWhich either People to this madness draws, âIf with less Slaughter that may be supply'd, âIt will unite us, rather then divide: âLet either City Combatants design, âAnd all her Fortune to their Swords resign, âAnd as of them the Gods shall then ordain, âLet the weak yield, and let the stronger Reign; âBut so, as blushes to the Loser sav'd, âThey may Subjected be, but not enslav'd, âAnd to no shame, or Tribute condescend, âBut on the Victor's Standards to attend. âThus our two States, we may one Empire call. He said no more, but this affected all: Each on the hostile Ranks casting his Eyes, A Friend, a Kinsman, or a Brother spies; They wonder how their greedy anger flew, In their own blood their weapons to embrew; And this reflection on each brow did write, Heat for the choice, and horrour for the Fight. At length this offer through the Squadrons born, On these conditions the wish'd peace was sworn; Three fight for each, but the Commanders take More leisure this important choice to make: Ours to the Camp, yours to the Senate went. CAMILLA. Oh Gods! how much you study my Cotnent! CURTIUS. 'Tis the agreement, that within two hours Our Champion's Fortune must determine Ours Till they are nam'd, we freely go and come, Rome in our Camp is, and our Camp in Rome: And since no Orders now access refuse, His old acquaintance every man renews. I (by my passion led) your Brothers found, And my Love since with such success is Crown'd, That now your Fathers word my hope allows; We shall to morrow joyn our Marriage Vows; You'l not, I trust, dispute what he commands. CAMILLA. A Daughters duty in obedience stands! CURTIUS. Come then that pleasing Order now receive Which must an end to all my sufferings give. CAMILLA. I go, in hope my Brothers there to see, And know the Period of our Misery. JULIA. Be that your way, the Temple shall be mine, Where for you both, I'le praise the powers divine. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCEN. I. Horace, and Curtius. CURTIUS. Thus Rome hath not divided her esteem, Another choice to her unjust would seem You, and your Brothers, this proud City calls, The greatest Souldiers that are in her Walls; And whilst before all, she you three prefers, She all our Houses braves with one of hers; And one may think as this Election runs, Rome hath no Souldiers, but your Fathers Sons: By this, three Families must raise their Name, And nobly consecrate themselves to Fame: Yes, by this choice we so much Honour see Giv'n to one House, as might Eternize three; And since in yours, my Fortune and my Flame Hath plac'd a Sister, and a Wife does claim, You justly may expect Concerns in me, From what I am, and what I am to be: But yet another reason does constrain My Joy, and mingles with it much of pain; For your fam'd courage to that pitch is flown, That Alba's fall already I bemoan. Her loss is certain now; and naming you, Ev'n Destiny her self hath sworn it too. In this Election I read Alba's doom, And count my self a Subject now of Rome. HORACE. 'Tis Rome, not Alba, your compassion claims, Viewing whom she rejects, and whom she names; Her partial favour may her Fortune lose, Who having so much choice, so ill does chuse: A thousand braver Sons she had then we, Who might with more success her Champions be. But though my ruine in this choice I find, With noble Pride it elevates my Mind; My Heart's assurance gathers mighty scope, And from my little courage, much I hope; Which howsoever fate intends to treat, I cannot think my self your subject yet: Rome hopes too well of me, and therefore I Will answer that great trust, or for it dye. He yet will dye, or vanquish, seldom fails; That brave despair most commonly prevails: How e're it be, she never shall obey Till my last gasp says, I have lost the Day. CURTIUS. Alas! my Fortune only calls for Tears, Since what my Countrey hopes, my friendship fears. Cruel extreams! Alba must be subdu'd, Or else her Triumph with your blood embrew'd, And all the Glory for which she has fought, Can onely with so dear a Life be bought! What can I wish, or what event desire, Since either so much sorrow will require? And every way I see my hopes deny'd. HORACE. Would you regret me if for Rome I dy'd? A Death so noble, lovely does appear, And is too Glorious to endure a Tear: Nay I should court it, and my ruine bless, If Rome by my defeat would suffer less. CURTIUS. But yet you may allow your friends to fear What will to them at least be so severe; They suffer in your glory, and one fate Makes you Immortal, them unfortunate. He loses all, who such a Friend must lose. But hither Flavius comes, and brings us news. Hath Alba's Councel yet her Champions chose? SCEN. II. Horace, Curtius, Flavius. FLAVIUS. I come to tell you. CURTIUS. Well, and who are those? FLAVIUS. You, and your Brothers. CURTIUS. Who? FLAVIUS. Ev'n they, and you: But why so stern, and so unpleas'd a Brow? Does this offend you? CURTIUS. No, but does surprize; The honour much above my Merit flies. FLAVIUS. Must the Dictator (who me hither sent) Be told you hear it with this discontent? This cold reception me too does surprize. CURTIUS. Tell him in spight of Loves and Friendships ties, Yet Curtius, and his Brothers mean to fight Against the Horaces, for Alba's Right. FLAVIUS. Against them! 'tis too much! but tell me how. CURTIUS. Carry my answer back, and leave me now. Exit Flavius SCEN. III. Horace, and Curtius. CURTIUS. Let Heav'n, and Earth, and Hell, now all engage To act against us their united rage; Let Gods, and Men, and Fate, and Devils too, Prepare against us all that they can do; Yet to reduce us to a worse Estate, I dare defie Heav'n, Earth, and Hell, and Fate: Horrour it self, hath somewhat less severe Then this our dismal Honour does appear. HORCE. Fortune hath careful of our Glory been, And gives a noble Scene to shew it in; Laboriously she forms us a distress Somewhat proportion'd to our Courages: No vulgar thought she does in us survey, And therefore treats us in no common way. For publick safety to attaque a Foe, And singly fight a man we do not know, Is what a vulgar vertue may beget, Thousands have done it, and may do it yet; Who would not for their Country lose their breath? Nay would not factious grow for such a death? But to resign her all that can be dear, And from our bosoms half our hearts to tear; With a destructive fury to pursue A Sister's Lover, a Wife's Brother too, And breaking all these knots to fight with him, Whose life we would, with our own blood, redeem; This is a vertue only fit for us, And for which few will be sollicitous: Few men have hearts of that exalted frame, That dare at such a rate pretend to Fame. CURTIUS. 'Tis true, time never shall our names deface, And we the brave occasion must embrace; Of a rare Vertue we shall mirrours be, But yours seems somewhat barbarous to me: There are not many Heros would grow vain By this harsh way, Eternity to gain. How much soe're you prize that empty noise, Obscurity were now the better choice: I dare avow it, and you might have seen I have not doubtful in my duty been: Nor could my friendship, nor my love prevail, To hold my Mind in an uncertain Scale. But since my Country by her Vote does shew She values me as much as yours does you: I hope to do, what you, or dare, or can, My Heart's as great, but I am still a man. I see my death alone your Fame secures, And that my honour lies in acting yours; I must shed blood, with which I would combine, So cross are all my Country's Stars to mine: Though no weak terrour can my heart disswade, Yet dismal horrour does it now invade; I mourn my fate, and envy theirs that are Already swallow'd by this greedy War. I would not call this sad, fierce honour back, Which can't o'rethrow the heart it does attaque; What I gain thence I like, mourn what I miss, And if Rome calls for firmer thoughts than this, I thank the Gods that I no Roman am, Lest all things humane I should then disclaim. HORACE. Though you're no Roman, yet deserve to be, And better shew how much you equal me; That solid Virtue which I make my boast, By any weaker tincture would be lost: His race of Honour is but ill design'd, Who at first start begins to look behind; Our suffering to the highest pitch is brought, I can see through it, but I tremble not. Where e're my Country will my arm employ, I must accept it with implicite joy; The glory of receiving such Commands, Every reflection but it self withstands; He who room then for other thoughts can find, Does what he ought with too remiss a mind; That sacred tie, must others uncreate, Rome arming me, I nothing must debate; Nor did I wed thy Sister with more ioy, Than now I'le seek her Brother to destroy: And this superfluous language to give o're, Y'are Alba's choice, nor must I know you more. CURTIUS. Yet to my torment, I must still know you, But this rough Virtue yet I never knew; And in this sad extremity of Fate Let me admire it, but not imitate. HORACE. No, no, embrace not Virtue by constraint; And since you find such pleasure in complaint, Freely enjoy it, and for your content, My Sister comes to help you to lament: I'le visit yours, and hope to make her know What generous things becomes my Wife to do; That if I fall, she may to you be kind, And bear her sorrows with a Roman mind. SCEN. IV. Horace, Curtius, Camilla. Horace to Camilla. Know you how glorious Curtius is to be? CAMILLA. Alas! how treacherous is my Destiny! HORACE. Now by your constancy your birth confess, And if my death allows him the success, Let him not be your Brother's Murtherer thought, But a brave man that does but what he ought, Who serves his Country nobly, and does shew By that great way how much he merits you; Conclude your match as if I were alive: But if this Sword shall him of life deprive, My conquest then with equal candour use, Nor of your Lover's death my hand accuse. I see your grief by your approaching tears, Exhale with him your sorrows and your fears; Quarrel with Heaven and Earth of Fate complain, But the fight done, no more regret the slain. You but a minute must with her bestow, (To Curtius And then where Honour calls us let us go. SCEN. V. Camilla, Curtius, CAMILLA. But wilt thou go, and this sad Fame possess At the expence of all our happiness? CURTIUS. Alas! what'ere I do, I find that I Must by my grief, if not by Horace, die; But as my Torture I this Honour see, And curse the favour Alba does to me; I hate that courage which she so esteems, Nay my despairing passion impious seems, And dares accuse the gods for all this woe, I mourn our Fortune, but yet I must go. CAMILLA. No, thou would'st have me all my interest use, And thee to Alba by my power excuse: Thy former Acts have thee so famous made, That to thy Country all thy debts are paid; None better hath than thou the War upheld, Nor with more deaths cover'd the guilty field. Thy Name can be no greater than it is, Suffer some other now t'ennoble his. CURTIUS. What shall my Eies anothers Temples see Bound with those Lawrels Fame prepares for me: Or by Posterity shall it be thought, Alba had conquer'd, if I would have fought? No, since to me she dares entrust her doom, She shall by me or fall, or overcome: A good account I'le of her Fortune give, And die with honour, or with conquest live. CAMILLA. But to betray me then, thy love endures! CURTIUS. I was my Country's e're I could be yours. CAMILLA. Wilt thou thy Sisters misery create, And widow her?â CURTIUS. Such is my cruel Fate: Brother and Sister, names so sweet before, By Alba's choice, and Rome's, are so no more. CAMILLA. Wilt thou present me with my Brother's head, And on that step mount to the Bridal bed? CURTIUS. All I dare think (so dear my fame will cost) Is still to love, though all my hope be lost. You weep my Dearâ CAMILLA. How can I tears avoid, Who by my cruel Lover am destroy'd? When Hymen would his kindled Torch have lent, He puts out that, to dig my Monument; This savage heart, my ruine can decree, And says he loves, when yet he murthers me. CURTIUS. How eloquent are tears from eyes we love! How strong does Beauty with that succour prove! My heart dissolves at such a mournful sight, Nor against that can all my vertue fight: Strike not my Fame in this subduing shape, But let my honour from your tears escape; I feel it shake, and scarce defend the place, For Curtius to the Lover yields apace; With Friendship it hath had enough to do, And must it strive with Love, and Pity too? Go, love me not, nor one tear more expose For him that dares offend such charms as those; I better with your anger should have fought, And to deserve it all, I love you not: Punish this treacherous, this ingrateful heart, At such an injury do you not start? I do not love you, can you me endure? Needs there more yet? my Faith I here abjure. O! rigid Virtue! at whose shrine I fall, Must thou a Crime to thy assistance call? CAMILLA. Commit no more, and I the gods attest, My love shall not be lessen'd, but encreas'd, My kindness shall ev'n in thy falshood live, All but a Brother's death I can forgive: Why am I Roman? or why art thou none? That I my self might put thy Lawrels on; I should thy valour heighten not forbid, And treat thee just as I my Brother did: But ah! how blind I now those vows esteem, Since against thee were all I made for him! But he returns, O! may Sabina be More prevalent with him than I'm with thee. SCEN. VI. Curtius, Camilla, Horace, Sabina. CURTIUS. Sabina too! my heart to undermine, And with Camilla must you Sister join? Leaving her tears her Brother to attaque, Hope you by yours to call my purpose back? SABINA. No Brother, no, I only visit you To give you my embrace and last adieu; Your blood's too good, nor need you apprehend From me what can your great resolves offend; If either were by this brave shock o'rethrown, He that first yielded, I should first disown. But may not I one favour beg of you, Worthy this Brother, and this Husband too? I wish your quarrel might less impious grow, And would refine the glory of the blow, That free from guilt, it might no splendour miss, I would fain make you lawful Enemies: I the sole link am of your sacred knot, Which will unty, assoon as I am not; Break then the chain whence that alliance grows, And since your Honour now will have you Foes, Buy by my death right to each others hate, And Rome's and Alba's Vote legitimate; Your hand destroying, his revenging me, Your Combat will appear no Prodigy; And one at least will justly stake his life, That he may right his Sister, or his Wife: But what? you think your Fame would be less bright, If for another quarrel you should fight; Your Country's cause will no new heats admit, Did you love less, you would act less for it. A Brother you must kill, a lov'd one too, Well then, defer not what you ought to do; But by his Sister him begin to kill, Or by his Wife his blood begin to spill; And by Sabina's blood, if her you prize, Make your own lives the braver sacrifice: You are a Foe to Rome, to Alba you, And my aversion to them both is due. What must I live to such a Victory, Whose highest triumph will but let me see A Brother, or a Husband Lawrels wear, Reaking with blood that is to me so dear? How shall I then decide my inward strife, Or well express the Sister and the Wife? The Conqueror embrace, the conquer'd grieve? No, no, Sabina's death shall her relieve, From whomsoe're my grief that blow procures, And my hands must bestow it, if not yours. Go then, what does your savage hearts restrain, Against your will, I my desire shall gain, For you no sooner shall begin your blows, But you shall see this bosom interpose: Nor shall your impious Swords your rage pursue, Unless through me they make their way to you. HORACE. O Wife! CURTIUS. O Sister! CAMILLA. Courage! they dissolve! SABINA. What can you sigh? paleness your cheek involve? What makes you shrink? are these the hearts so brave Who in their hands the fates of Empire have? HORACE. Tell me Sabina what thy quarrel is, That could deserve so sharp revenge as this? Or against thee, what could my honour doe, That thou shouldst it so cruelly pursue? But be content t'have forc'd it to a Bay, And let me finish this important day; Thou hast o're me a strange advantage got, But as thou lov'st thy Husband triumph not; Go then, a doubtful Victory were here unfit, 'Tis shame enough to have dispatched it. O let me bravely end my daies at least. SABINA. Go, fear not me, thy party is encreas'd. SCEN. VII. Old Horace, and all the rest. Old HORACE. How's this my Sons? trifling with Womens charms, When Rome and Alba call you to your Arms? You must shed blood, then why should tears surprize? But shun th' infectious sorrow of their Eyes: For if you stay, their cunning tenderness, Will on you both, obtain the first success; And in such Wars to flie is to subdue. SABINA. Fear nothing, Sir, they are too worthy you, In spight of us, you in them both shall see, All that your Son, and Son-in-law should be; If our tears could an impression give, We'll them to your severer vertue leave. Come Sister, come, let's no more sorrow lose, These Rocks will still resist such floods as those; 'Tis to despair alone that we must flie; Go Tygers fight, we'll find a way to die. SCEN. VIII. Old Horace, Young Horace, Curtius. Young HORACE. Sir, by your prudence their escape prevent, Or they'll pursue us with their discontent, And with a noise unwelcome and abrupt, Their love and grief our fight will interrupt; Which may give envy a pretence to stick Upon our names, that poor and crafty trick: And our great choice would be too dearly bought, If we were charg'd with one unworthy thought. Old HORACE. I shall be careful, go, your Brothers stay, Think only what your Countries claim to day. CURTIUS. How shall I bid adieu, or by what artâ Old HORACE. Ah! do not quite dissolve my trembling heart, My tongue so sad a farewel does deny, Nor can my heart thoughts strong enough supply; See! ev'n my Eyes swell with unwilling tears, Go, do your parts, and let the gods do theirs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCEN. I. Sabina alone. I must my party chuse in this sad strife, And either be all Sister, or all Wife; I'le no more vain divided cares express, But somewhat wish, and fear a little less: Yet ah! what party in this dismal Fate? Can I a Husband, or a Brother hate? Nature and love for each does intercede, And sence of Honour for them both does plead: Let their sublimer thoughts yet govern mine, And so my different duties will combine: Their Honour is the Object I'le adore, Their Vertue imitate, and fear no more. Since there's such beauty in the death they court, I must unmov'd encounter the report, And no more think my Fate compassion wants, But weigh the Cause, and not the Combatants: The Conquerors I'le with that gladness view, As will from all their Family be due; And not reflecting at whose bloods expence, Their Vertues raise them to that eminence, I'le in their Houses fame concern'd appear; Here I am Wife, and am a Daughter there, And to each party am so strictly ty'd, That I must be on the triumphant side: Fortune though thou art studious in thy spight, Yet I have learn'd thence to extract delight; And now can fearless see the fight, the slain Without despair, the Victors without pain. Flattering delusion sweet, but gross deceit, My labouring Spirits, weak and flying, cheat; By whose false light my dazled Soul's misled, Alas how quickly is thy comfort fled! A flash of Lightning thus relieves the night, Making that darker by its hasty flight; As these faint beams of joy my Soul betray'd, But to involve it in a thicker shade: For Heav'n which saw my griefs, by this decrease, Hath dearly sold me this short minutes peace, And my griev'd heart from no one wound is free'd, At which a Husband, or a Brother bleed; Which sad reflection so much terrour draws, I onely view the Actors, not the Cause: Nor can the Conquerours fame salute my thought, But to remember with whose Blood 'twas bought; The vanquish't Family claims all my care, Here I'm a Wife, and am a Daughter there, And to each party am so strictly ty'd, That I must be on the unhappy side. Is this the Peace I thought so long deferr'd? And thus great Gods have you my Prayers heard? What Thunder-bolts then can you anger find, Since y'are thus cruel when you would be kind? Or which way will you punish an offence, If thus you treat the Vows of innocence? SCEN. II. Sabina and Julia. SABINA. Is it done Julia? and what fatal news? Must I a Husband, or a Brother lose? Or to their impious Arms does this befall, That angry Heav'n has sacrific'd them all? And lest my horrour for the conquering side Should ease my woes, must that too be deny'd? JULIA. To what is past are you a stranger yet? SABINA. I am; and can you be surpriz'd at it? Know you not Julia, that the House you see, A Prison for Camilla is and me? They here confine us both, and are afaraid Our pious tears their fury should disswade, And that the sorrows of our spotless love, Should in both Armies some compassion move. JULIA. They needed not such Orators as you, For they were hinder'd at their interview: No sooner they appear'd prepar'd to fight, But either Army murmur'd at the sight, To see such friends, persons so near ally'd, Their Country's quarrel chosen to decide; This man's with pity, that with horrour fir'd, Another highly their brave heat admir'd; One with his praises imps their spacious Fame, Another calls it by a guilty Name. But yet their different thoughts have but one Voice To blame their Leaders, and detest the choice. All did this barbarous Combat so condemn, That with united haste they parted them. O Gods! what Incense my contentment owes! JULIA. Stay yet Sabina, e're you pay your Vows; You may increase your hopes, abate your fears, But there's enough still to deserve your Tears. In vain, alas! the Champions they would save; For they remain as obstinate as brave; And their ambitious Souls were so much touch'd With the great Glory which they now approach'd, That what the Souldiers pity'd they ador'd, And seem affronted, when they are deplor'd: They think that kindness does their fame no right, And with both Armies they will rather fight, And by the hands that sever'd them be slain, Than give their Countreys honours back again. SABINA. Can so much cruelty their bosoms fill! JULIA. It did, but yet both Armies murmur'd still, And universally their purpose held To ask new Champions, or a general Field: The Leaders presence they no longer fear'd, Their power scarce valu'd, or their Voices heard. Th' amazed King this mischief to oppose, Since every one (says he) enraged grows, Let us on this consult the powers above; What impious man dares their command disown, When they in sacrifice have made it known? He us'd no more words, but these were commands; They snatch the Arms from the six Champions hands, And that blind thirst of Fame they so intend, Sence of Religion does a while suspend; By some new scruple, or a great respect, Our Princes Counsel they resolve t'effect; Which in both Camps so great a Reverence found, As if both Nations had our Tullus Crown'd. The Victims death will give us farther light. SABINA. The Gods will never own that Guilty Fight: From this delay some new hopes may be drawn, And sure my happiness begins to dawn. SCEN. III. Camilla, Sabina, Julia. SABINA. I have news Sister, that will please you much. CAMILLA. I think I know it, if you call it such; My Father heard it now, and so did I, But nothing thence my hopes can fortify: This delay'd mischief threatens sorer blows, And does but lengthen out too certain woes; And by the hinderance of this new Contest, Our tears are but suspended, not supprest. SABINA. This Tumult was not vainly sure inspir'd. CAMILLA. But vainly they have of the Gods enquir'd; For the same Gods guided our Princes choice, Nor speak they often in the Peoples Voice; Their counsel shines not in a Vulgar Brest, But Kings that represent them know it best; In whose Supream Authority we see A secret Ray of their Divinity. JULIA. You will contribute to your own distress To seek their will, but in their Oracles; And that which yesterday reliev'd your Care, May serve to day to banish your despair. CAMILLA. An Oracle is so wrapt up in doubt, The more we guess, the less we find it out; There's nothing certain in this remarque, Who thinks all clear, must know that all is dark. SABINA. Let's give our confidence a larger scope, And entertain a reasonable hope; When Heaven begins to grant what we have sought, They that distrust its smiles deserve them not; We hinder often what we so suspect, And send back comfort by that rude neglect. CAMILLA. Heaven governs us, without our own consents, And we are passive in these great events. JULIA. Hope then with me, that when we meet again, A gentler Theam our thoughts shall entertain, And that this evening with a welcome care, We for your marriage only shall prepare. SABINA. I hope as much. CAMILLA. 'Tis more than I dare do. JULIA. Th' event will shew us whose presage is true. SCEN. IV. Sabina, Camilla. SABINA. Sister, your sorrows I must needs condemn, Unless their causes did more warrant them; What would you do, and at what rate lament, Had you my reason for your discontent, And if from what these fatal Arms design, Your losses could be thought as great as mine? CAMILLA. Let both our sorrows equally be known, For we are all too partial to our own; But when compar'd to my distress'd extreams, Your griefs will seem but melancholy dreams: A Husband's danger is your only care, With whom your Brothers never can compare; When to another Family ally'd, From our own kinred we are quite unty'd: Parents with Husbands no dispute admit, To follow these, we those can gladly quit: But love when by a Father's will made good, Is less than marriage, yet not less than blood; And so betwixt them our concern is tost, Our choice suspended, and our wishes lost. But you may find a way amidst your fears, To raise your wishes, and restrain your tears: When if Heav'n still its cruelty intend, I can wish nothing, but all apprehend. SABINA. Against each other when such foes are bent, There's small conviction in your argument; For blood as well as marriage is a Knot, We quit our Kindred, but forget them not: Never does Hymen Nature undermine, Who loves her Husband, does not hate her Line. Since neither tye will their pretensions lose, When life's concern'd, one knows not what to chuse; On this side, and on that, by turns we fall, Extremity of sorrow equals all: Whereas a Lover most esteem'd, is still But a dependent on your sovereign will, And a capricious or a jealous hour May make your rigour equal to your power; What fancie can, your reason may perswade, So love no more will Nature's rights invade; For 'tis a crime to pay no more respect To tyes born with us, than those we elect. Thus if Heav'ns angry cloud will farther spread, I nothing have to hope, but all to dread. But duty offers, (to dry up your Tears) Aim for your wishes, Limits for your fears. CAMILLA. Ah! Sister, I perceive your setled Heart Never knew Love, nor felt his venom'd Dart: At first indeed we may the Boy resist, Who once receiv'd, can never be dismiss'd; When Duty to his flame does fuel bring, He grows a Tyrant from a Lawful King; He enters gently, but by force he reigns; And when a heart once wears his golden chains, To cast them off our wills too weak are grown, Because that will no longer is our own: The fetters glitter, but are fetters stillâ SCEN. V. Old Horace, Sabina, Camilla. Old HOR. Daughters I bring you news that's very ill; But it would be in vain now to forbear, Since you the fatal story soon must hear. Your Brothers fightâfor so the Gods ordain. SAB. I must confess it horrour does contain; And the Divinity had once my trust To be more kind at least, if not more just. Comfort us not, for reason tedious grows, When such a tide of sorrow 't would oppose: In our own hands, our remedy we have; For who dares dye, may all misfortunes brave. Perhaps we our despair might seem to scorn, And with false constancy our selves adorn; But when without a blush we may admit Of grief, 'twere weakness to dissemble it: We to your sex can such a cunning spare, And will pretend only to what we are; Nor expect we a courage of your strain Should stoop by our example to complain: Receive this cruel news without a groan, Behold our tears, and never mix your own; And in a Fortune that is so Forlorn, Be still unmov'd, but suffer us to mourn. OLD HORACE. I think your tears so due to your distress, That all my Courage scarce can mine suppress; And ev'n that Virtue might surrender too, Were I as much concern'd in it, as you. Not that the Alban choice makes me so stern, [To Sab. To rob your Brothers of my first concern; But friendship would in vain pretend to sway, When Love and Nature will dispute the Day; And my heart no such tenderness receives, By which a Sister, or a Mistress grieves; I can look on them as the publick Foes, And give my Sons, my undivided Vows; I thank the Gods their Countrey without shame May assert them, as they have done their Fame; I saw what Glory all their Brows adorn'd, When the compassion of both Camps they scorn'd; If any weakness had that pity sought, Nay had they not abhorr'd so poor a thought, My arm for such a wrong to Vengeance bent, Had punish'd that degenerate content. But when the Field would needs the choice renew, I must confess, I then desir'd it too, And if relenting Heav'n had heard my voice, Alba had been reduc'd to other choice; The Horaces had then triumphant stood With Swords unstained in the Curtian Blood, And by a Combat less to Natures shame, Had sav'd the Honour of the Roman name. But otherwise the mighty Gods design, And their high pleasure must determine mine. With generous thoughts I build my great resolve, And in the publick Int'rest mine involve; Take you that course to stop your sorrows growth, Rememb'ring this that you are Romans both. to Cam.You are by birth, what to Sab. you by vows became And there's a noble Fortune in that Name. Rome shall hereafter to that Empire grow, That the whole World shall to her Ensigns bow; The trembling Universe her Yoke shall bear, And Kings shall court the Title that you wear. This our Ãneas from the Gods obtain'd.â SCEN. VI. Old Horace, Sabina, Camilla, Julia. Old HOR. Well, Julia know you, who the Day has gain'd? JULIA. I know how Fatally it does conclude, Rome now must stoop to Alba's servitude: Two of your Sons are by the Albans slain, Sabina's Husband only doth remain; Who startling at this too unequal fight, Himself preserv'd hath by his speedy flight. Old HOR. Ah fearful Courge! heat without a flame! Thou to thy house hast brought Eternal shame! I those regret not who for their Country's slain, But him whose fear suffers to live; in vain He hopes, by this base act, his Life to save, I'le quickly send him to his Brother's grave: I to Revenge am now so fully bent, My steady heart will never it relent. JULIA. Can you him blame, in this unequal strife, When hope is gone, to flye to save his life? Valour o'repower'd, who will of fear condemn, To shun that tyde of woes he cannot stem? What would you have had him done? HORACE. Have dy'd, And spent his life by his brave Brothers side. Ah treacherous Destiny! that thou should'st give A Son to me, Rome's freedom to outlive. The fight, true Courage never will forsake, When his own Country's freedom lies at stake. CAMILLA. But has his hasty flight his life then sav'd? Is famous Rome by Alba quite enslav'd? JULIA. After this passage I made no delay, To tell you th' news I hastened away. Old HORACE. His fearful flight has so my honour stain'd, That it by him can never be regain'd. JULIA. He fled not 'till all hopes were lost and vain, His want of courage you need not complain. Old HORACE. He should have fought still, rouz'd his Valour now, Trusting to what the Pow'rs above might do; If he had fallen, he had with honour dy'd, And to his Name eternal Fame had ty'd. But since he's fled, if I him ever see, This hand his Executi'ner shall be, And by that deed shall to the world make known, At what a rate his action I disown. SABINA. Ah Sir! a little check this generous heat, And do not make our miseries compleat. Old HORACE. Your grief Sabina easie help endures, Since our afflictions are no longer yours; Heaven in our Sorrows yet excusing you, Hath sav'd your Husband, and your Brothers too: We are betray'd, but they have overcome, And 'tis your Country hath subjected Rome; And in the lustre of your Brothers fame, You lose the sight of all our loss and shame: But your concern for this unworthy Man shall give You quickly cause as well as us to grieve; Your tears for him will no protection prove, For here I swear by all the powers above, These very hands, e're night invade the day, Shall in his Blood wash Romes disgrace away. Exit. SABINA. Let's follow him, lest rage his reason blind; O Gods! and will you never more be kind! Must every hour new blows to us impart, And still from hands that much increase the smart? Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCEN. I. Old Horace, and Camilla. Old HORACE. Go, no more breath for such a Coward lose, Let him flye me as he has done his foes; To save that wretched Life he held so dear, He has done little; if he now appear, Sabina may prevent it, or I vow By all the Powers to which we mortals bowâ CAMILLA. Oh Sir! this cruel thought no more pursue, Or Rome her self will kinder be than you, And she as much as she by this does lose; Valour opprest by number will excuse. Old HORACE. I'm not concern'd what mercy Rome confers, I have a Father's rights distinct from hers; And know what genuine Vertue would have done, It might be worsted, but not trampled on; True valour never knows a base allay, And though it lose, can never yield the day. But let us hear what does Valerius bring. SCEN. II. Old Horace, Camilla, Valerius. VALERIUS. I'm sent to wait upon you from the King, Who mourns your lossâ Old HORACE. That merits not his care, And I the needless complement can spare; I my Sons deaths rather than shame would know, And tears than blushes better can allow; They that are slain, like men of honour dy'd, And that's enoughâ VAL. But they are all supply'd By him that lives, and his immortal Fame. Old HOR. Would he had perish'd too, and all my Name! VAL. Can only you his Virtue dis-esteem? Old HOR. 'Tis I alone that ought to punish him. VAL. And what offence has in his conduct been? Old HOR. But what great Vertue in his flight was seen? VAL. Flight in this case wears an illustrious Name. Old HOR. Why do you cover my gray hairs with shame? Th' example's rare indeed! and few would die, If men could catch bright honour when they flie. VAL. Do you a shame, and a confusion call, T' have had a Son who has preserv'd us all; Who with new triumphs did Rome's Empire save? What greater honours could a Father have? Old HOR. What Honours and what Triumphs brings he home, When Alba must dispose the Fate of Rome? VAL. What great success of Alba has appear'd? Or have you yet but half the story heard? Old HOR. Was not the Combat ended by his flight? VAL. So Alba thought at that mistaken sight, But she soon found, he fled but as became A man entrusted with his Country's Fame. HOR. Does Rome triumph? VAL. O! his great story hear, To whom you so unjustly are severe. When he against three Foes was left alone, Each of them having wounds, he having none; Too weak for all, too strong for either's rage, He dext'rously himself did dis-engage; The stratagem of seeming flight he try'd, And so th' abused Brothers does divide; They all pursue, yet not with equal haste, But as their wounds permit them, slow or fast: Horace looks back his scatter'd Foes upon, Whom he already thinks half overthrown: He waits your Son-in-law, for he was first; Who much incens'd to see that so he durst, His utmost braving does in vain express, For his lost Blood denys him the success; Alba, whose hopes with Curtius strength decay'd, Soon his next Brother summons to his aid, Who hastening to his rescue finds too late, He was preceded by his Brother's fate. CAMILLA. Alas! VALERIUS. Yet breathless his revenge begun, But quickly gives new conquest to your Son; Who soon defeated all the Arts he try'd, And laid him gasping by his Brothers side: The Air resounds with noises thither sent From Roman Joy, and Alban discontent. Our Hero, when so near his triumph drew, Not only conquers now, but braves them too: I to my Brothers shades give what is past, But to thee Rome I sacrifice this last; Accept dear Country, this so noble Blood, (Says he,) and flies to make his promise good. The victory did scarce admit suspence, The wounded Alban making small defence, But as a Victim to the Altar goes, And his Throat offers to the deadly blows; So he gave up his undefended breath, Securing Rome's Dominion by his Death. Old HORACE. O! my brave Son! true heir of all renown, Onely supporter of a falling Crown! O Vertue worthy of Romes boast and mine! Thy Country's succour, glory of thy Line! When into tenderness shall I convert, All my injustice to thy great desert? When shall I my repenting kindness show, And with glad tears bathe thy victorious Brow! VAL. That your Endearments may soon find a place, The King will hasten him to your Embrace; And therefore till to morrow is delay'd The Sacrifice which must to heav'n be paid; This day no other Gratitude allows, But Songs of Triumph, and the publick Vows; Where Horace waits the King, by whom I'm sent To ease your Grief, and heighten your content: But this is not enough for him to pay, He'll come himself, and that perhaps to day. This noble action does oblige him so, That his own thanks he will on you bestow, Who have resign'd your Sons to save his Throne. Old HOR. That honour is too great for me to own; And I'm requited, by what you have said, For all the Blood my Sons have spilt or shed. VAL. The King, who no imperfect bounty knows, His rescu'd Scepter from insulting Foes Values so much, that all that he can do, He thinks below either your Son or You: But I shall tell him with what noble fire Heroick Vertue does your Soul inspire, And how much Loyal Zeal to him you bear. Old HOR. You'l much oblige me by so kind a care. SCEN. III. Old Horace, Camilla. Old HOR. Daughter, your Tears are out of season now, And misbecome the place where Honours grow; Domestick losses we may well excuse, When they do publick Victories produce: It is enough, Rome does o're Alba sway, And all our sufferings that one word must pay: You but a man lost when your Lover fell; Whom you may quickly now repair as well. What noble Roman after this success, But would be proud to make you an address? But to Sabina I this news must bear, Whose blow must needs be very rude to her; And her three Brothers by her Husband slain, Will give her much more reason to complain: But I despair not to appease her yet, And she who is so brave, and so discreet, Will without pain her generous Soul dispose To that submission which her honour owes. Till when suppress your grief you now resent, Nor entertain him with this discontent: In brief, let him a Sister meet, and find In the same blood, the same heroick mind. SCEN. IV. CAMILLA. Yes, I shall quickly to that Brother prove, That none can fear to die, who dares to love; Nor can submit to those stern Parents sway, Whom cruel Heav'n condemns us to obey. You blame my grief, you call it mean and poor, But in revenge I'll cherish it the more. Relentless Father! and my tears shall flow, Till their streams rapid as their causes grow; Never did Fortune shift her treacherous part So many times to break a single heart; Sometimes she flatter'd, and sometimes did fright; Never in one day, did one heart appear So toss'd, from grief to joy, from hope to fear: An Oracle assures, a Dream torments, The Battel threatens, and the Peace contents. Just on my Marriage Eve, the Cities chose My Lover and my Brother to be Foes: The Souldiers murmure, and revoke the choice, The gods again confirm it by their voice; Rome seems subdu'd, and with my Brothers blood, My Curtius only unpolluted stood. But did my Heart too little grief contain, To see my Country stoop, and Brothers slain? Or did my Fancy give too large a scope, To love yet guiltless, and yet living hope? His death revenges on me that abuse, With the sad way wherein I heard the news: Valerius tells it, and to brave my Fate, The sad event does odiously relate: An open gladness did his visage dress, Less by Rome's glory caus'd than my distress; Since by his Rival's death his hopes renew, He seems to share my Brother's triumph too. But this is nothing to my present wo, I am requir'd, with joy, to meet the blow: I to the Conqueror must my praise impart, And kiss a hand that stabs me to the heart: And when my grief so justly great appears, They place an infamy upon my tears: I must rejoice at what afflicts me thus, And to be noble, must be barbarous. But from this Father I'll degenerate, And will deserve this gallant Brother's hate: For humane frailty sure illustrious grows, When brutishness, for vertue they impose. Appear my griefs, why should you now forbear, When all is lost, what hath one left to fear? This savage Conqueror I will not flye, But will upbraid him with his Victory; Offend his Conquest, irritate his rage, And if ought can, let that my grief asswage: He comes, let my just sorrow now disclose, What to a Lover slain a Mistress owes. SCEN. V. Horace, Camilla. HORACE. Sister, this arm our Brothers has reveng'd, And Rome's declining Destiny has chang'd; Has to Rome's sway subjected Alba's Fate, And in one day dispos'd of either State. Behold what Trophies I have won, and pay What's due from you to such a glorious day. CAMILLA. Receive my tears then, which are all I owe. HORACE. Rome in her Triumphs will not those allow: Bloud hath too well appeas'd our Brothers slain, For you by tears to wash away their stain. A loss that is reveng'd, should be forgot. CAMILLA. Since then our hapless Brothers need them not, I shall not think my tears to them are due, Who are so fully satisfi'd by you. But who will make my happiness return? Or call that Lover back for whom I mourn? HORACE. How's that? CAMILLA. My Curtius, ah too brave! too dear! HORACE. Ha! what are those audacious words I hear? Can my degenerate Sister then retain Love for a publick Foe, whom I have slain? Thy guilty passion to revenge aspires, But govern better thy unjust desires; Remove my blushes, and thy flame suppress, And be in love only with my success: Let these great Trophies thy delight confine. CAMILLA. Give me, Barbatian, then, a heart like thine; And since my thoughts I can no more disclaim, Restore my Curtius, or excuse my flame; All my delight, with his dear life is fled, I lov'd him living, and lament him dead. If thou the Sister seek'st thou left'st behind, An injur'd Mistress only thou wilt find, Who like a Fury still must thee pursue, And still reproach thee with his murther too. Inhumane Brother! who forbid'st my tears, To whom my ruine such a joy appears: Who of thy cruel slaughters growing vain, Would'st have me kill my Curtius o're again: May such incessant sorrows follow thee, That thou may'st be reduc'd to envy me, And by some wretched action soon defame, Thy so ador'd, and yet so brutish Name. HORACE. O Heavens! who ever saw such raging love! Believ'st thou nothing can my temper move? And in my blood can I this shame permit? Love, love that blow which so ennobles it; And the remembrance of one man resign, To th' interests of Rome, if not to mine. CAMILLA. To Rome! the only object of my hate! To Rome! whose quarrel caus'd my Lover's Fate! To Rome! where thou wert born, to thee so dear, Whom I abhor, 'cause she does thee revere. May all her neighbours, in one knot combine, Her yet unsure foundations t'undermine; And if Italian Forces seem too small, May East and West conspire to make her fall; And all the Nations of the barbarous World, To ruine her, o're Hills and Seas be hurl'd: Nor these loath'd Walls may her own fury spare, But with her own hands her own bowels tear; And may Heaven's angel kindled by my wo, Whole deluges of fire upon her throw; May my eyes see her Temples overturn'd, These Houses ashes, and thy Lawrels burn'd; See the last gasp which the last Roman draws, And die with ioy for having been the cause. HORACE. CAMILLA. Ah Traitor!â HORACE. Perish, and be that their doom, Who dare lament an Enemy of Rome. SCEN. VI. Horace, Proculus. PROCULUS. What have you done? HORACE. An honourable act, Such an offence does such revenge exact. FINIS.</field>
