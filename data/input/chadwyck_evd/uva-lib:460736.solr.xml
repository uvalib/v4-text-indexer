      <field name="fulltext">‘Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?’</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene: In the capital of Sigismund's Kingdom in Germany, and in or near a Ruined Castle on its Northern Frontiers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Time: The Last Twenty Years of the Sixteenth Century</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART I. ACT I. SCENE I. The Audience Hall in Sigismund's Palace. Enter a Herald, followed by a Pursuivant. HERALD The King is risen, and the day begins. PURSUIVANT This is the marriage morn of Sigismund! Let cannon tell the cloud, cloud tell the stars, Till, on the pealing echoes of our news, The sun-ball, floated in its lake of air, Is jarred, and trembles! (A burst of ordnance.) [Enter rather hurriedly the Count of Gemmingen and a Courtier. Other Nobles and Courtiers begin to pass confusedly across the stage during their dialogue frequently whispering together. COURTIER (in a low voice) Arnheim fell this morning. COUNT OF GEMMINGEN Art perfect upon this? Who told thee so? COURTIER 'Tis blazed already; there is a pack of troopers Cursing anent these tidings: honest fellows, They mint ingenious oaths in their dismay. COUNT OF GEMMINGEN Conrad must ride to rescue. Think you, friend, This upstart harbours any martial pith? COURTIER Trust me, no cantle! 'Tis a moodish youth Propt on the favour of our shallow queen. COUNT OF GEMMINGEN She doth affect him? Why? COURTIER Some rusty Count Begat this Conrad, who a world of years Ago was our Queen Bertha's quondam true-love. They say, she was contracted half to him; But Sigismund cast favourable glances, And her wise kin snapped the pre-nuptial ring, And shelved the musty Count. COUNT OF GEMMINGEN Court favour runs Upon the strangest wheels. COURTIER That knowledge came Before my first court-suit had dropt a button, Or moulted one gold tag. Our life is crammed Here with surprises. No man may predict Upon what veering eddy, what rash wind, This royal pair, Bertha and Sigismund, Will launch their paper boats. COUNT OF GEMMINGEN I find him altered Rarely of late. Last night, after his ride, He seemed more like a charnel-shelf's dry mummy Than a live, breathing king. COURTIER Our eye-shot tallies— He cannot last much longer. COUNT OF GEMMINGEN If he die— COURTIER (whispers) You are the next in blood. COUNT OF GEMMINGEN That nearness makes me So faintly welcome here. But I regard These things as naught; a cup of good canary Is sweeter than ambition. COURTIER Sir, you are wise— Our sultan, he sleeps late! COUNT OF GEMMINGEN He quaintly chooses His morn of over-rest. His doting wits Replace themselves in cradle, and want pap-meat, To find an opiate syrup in this news, Which rends our realm as earthquake. SECOND COURTIER (coming up from behind and tapping his shoulder) Curb your tongues: Hush, he is coming: duck your heads and go. COURTIER (to Gemmingen) Shall we make exit or remain? SECOND COURTIER Go, quickly; Our Emperor comes with an angry eye; 'Twere better to defer our salutations. (He turns to withdraw.) A NOBLE Sir, you are on my foot. SECOND COURTIER Sir, you have caught Your sleeve-lace in my sword-knot. [Exeunt Count of Gemmingen, Courtier, Nobles and Courtiers, hurriedly, jostling each other off. Sigismund and Bertha enter from different sides of the stage. They meet in the centre. BERTHA Nay, both hands, Both hands, my husband: shall our wedding morn Enter our halls ungreeted? Dear old Day, A little weaker and more white each year He comes from roaming in the void with stars; Humbly returns, true to his time, knocks once Feebly upon the panel, sighs, looks round, And takes his annual seat beside our hearth, Revives his withered fingers at our fire, Warms in his corner, chats with us his hour, Then shoulders up his fardel, nods good bye, And stumbles out again for one more year, Lame, blind, and grey, to wrestle in the march And radiant onset of more mighty stars. The vast and burning pathways of the void Vex his old feet: severe with golden eyes The strong young planets with their consort moons Despise and pass him. But the old wanderer Crawls round his orbit somehow with the best Of Ether's rolling children: and once more He comes into his chair, and whispers, ‘Hail,— I made you one some forty years ago, And, like an ancient swallow, I return, To the old wedding-nest beneath your eaves. I go and I return—if I return— For such a blindness deepens round my eyes, I fancy, I may never come again,— And, therefore, this time welcome me the more. For in that steep and labyrinthine void, Stars drop, like summer flies, and are not found. So shall I sink down somewhere in that night, And feel the beaming wheels of God's elect New lights, that churn and grind me into haze— So I may come no more!’ SIGISMUND Old day of bells, Welcome! There goes the minster's thunder growl, As some great mastiff peals the lesser mouths Of fellow watch-dogs down. A furlong east, Second in emphasis and harshness, rocks The swinging tongue of Holy Sepulchre. Then, with her pert white steeple perched in air, Sweet little Sainted Emily chimes in, Like the sudden laughter of a girl surprised; Or the repeated tinkle of a thrush Before he settles into his stream of song. The wind shakes with the music of them all Giving me joy: joy on this sable morn, When the mute knell should be unchained and break This carillon with dirges. Shall I send And chide their irony of triumph dumb, Because we know— BERTHA Nay, let that rest, my lord, For the division of a day. SIGISMUND It shall. This is my wedding morn: I claim an hour Before I cope with this vexation. Come, And let me kiss thy kindly wishes back, My Bertha, best old bride with silver hair; Trouble will keep, so let them clash their bells, Like children laughing in a house of death;— Come to thy old man, read how worn he is: Kiss out the wrinkled lines across his brow: Relume the faded eyes which found thee fair On this day forty years—(a pause). Merciful God! Four times ten slow long years! How are they gone? Wife, wife, how dare we sit outside our graves After such lapse enormous? Can we dream To see another anniversary? BERTHA God keep you, Sigismund, for many more. SIGISMUND Nay, sweet, that cannot be. My feet tread down The ruined brinks of bone-pits. A bruised thing, My instinct is to hide and crawl away Out of the strong reproachful stress of light Into dark places. For the noon begins To sting with an intolerable beam My haggard eye-balls. Others, fair and young, Wide-eyed out-stare the vivid Phœbus, hold Orbs, that wink not, full on his disc, and dare Ascend a staircase ladder broad in beams; And the god teems out amber aureoles On their ascending foreheads, till they burn As daffodils just level with the sun Steeping blue distances of April dawn; So in a shaft of the great planet's fire They bathe their heads, new Memnons in whose curls Auroral torches bicker. Up they go To reach down stars! BERTHA And presently descend Foul-handed as the folk who rake at fires; They went to glean the starry floors for gold, And found some lumps of clay, no better grained Than the red mud caked round the hoofs of swine, Whose styes are near the hovels of their birth; Wherein their wiser brothers dwell content, And heed their hogs with unaspiring hearts, And mock these sky-explorers on return With a sneer baleful, saying, ‘It is best To take thy fate in quiet. Feed and rot After thy feast in chambers with the worm; Why wilt thou scale the stars in thy desire? Clay art thou, and clay only shalt thou find; For, as the hand that seeketh, so shall be Its treasure trove; and thou, impure, shalt rake Pollution from the living herb of heaven.’ SIGISMUND Alas, my Bertha, thou hast imaged well, How youth aspires to wrench his crown off God, And presently is tumbled out of heaven, Lucifer fallen. Yet in my horny eld, I fain must lift my withered voice and cry, How beautiful is Youth, despite its folly, Despite its mad presumption; glory of God, Gloss of the flower-face, whither art thou gone? Thou movest with such beauty in thy limbs, That, ere we understand one tithe of the grace In which thou glidest o'er us, thou art past, And with thee go garland, and feast, and song, The cup-wine is exhausted to its grounds; The very hand, which holds the beaker, aches. Spectre of man, limp home: thy turn is done: Thy foot-hold feeble, all thy fingers numb; Thou tremblest as a feather on a pool, Where there is hardly any hint of wind Moving the level water just at eve, And yet it twists and drives and has no peace. BERTHA Hale are you yet near others of your age. SIGISMUND I know, that we are both of us quite grey, And, that I sit more near the shore of shade By half a decade than this wife of mine, Who is not young to shake so with her hand: Ah, poor old love, cold are thy lips indeed, And grey thy cheek; I miss its patch of rose. BERTHA My roses brought me thee: their use is past; Let them go then: old husband, thou art mine, Rosy or grey, fast till the final dawn. Let the bloom perish, I can laugh; for Love Is stronger than the poppy's petal shed After an hour's expansion. Smile with me, Old sweetheart, for the most triumphant river Runs into briny death, and spring's best leaf Awaits the wormy ground. So smile or weep! SIGISMUND I am out of tune for smiling with the cold; The East lays silver crust on palace pipes, Whence wary swallows long have flitted home. The shrewd wind pinches my old shoulder-blades: These halls of mine used to be weather-proof; But now in legion icy currents creep Through mason-work and window lozenges— A sorry palace; we could warm our bones As well inside a wind-mill on a moor. The year is ebbing and the land is sad With blots of vapour. Sere leaf-terraces Shudder beneath the black breeze stinging them, And grind their rusty masses, leaf on leaf, Branch against branch. And over all the rack Rides paler than a moon-mist, and its cloud Swings with an iron face: you call this summer! This make-believe, whose few belated flowers Stare numbly upwards at the place of stars, Born after time. Come hither, love, and gaze Out at my side across the frosty lands; Lo, at our oriel, this old lover pair, Bridegroom and bride, link frozen fingers, set Chill palms together, as in rose-time once In that long yesterday since we were one. Does not this prospect emblem our life well? Nearly a waste, outspreading its gaunt sides Of flat, coarse herbage to the region hills; A scrub of woodland, bushes more than trees; A huddled hamlet, like a broken comb With half the teeth gone. Bertha, search this waste, Sweeten its ragged unfertility, I am sick of such a kingdom: I am shamed That we have journeyed by so mean a road: Have all those miles we came no land-mark? BERTA One— There is a bourn, whereby one mother found Infinite weeping. Far, far off it lies; When on its heavy grasses the light turns, Then it burns out, one small white sepulchre, The shallow grave of our sole baby son— There lies the child, who should have ruled for us, When we were dust, in purple. SIGISMUND Peace, have peace! You break me on your words as with a wheel. Why do you bring this up? Well, my son died, Who had a realm to give him; while among The fetid lanes and pestilential stews, My hinds are overrun with rats and sons, And have no crust for either! BERTHA God changed that; And gave us afterwards another child. SIGISMUND A girl he gave us, which in heirless halls Is changing rubies for red tinselled glass, Or nightingales for lapwings. BERTHA Petulant! Use better words; the girl is well enough. SIGISMUND Ay, in all else save boyhood amply well, Which wanted, we remain in need of all. We love our daughter. Pure as Hesperus, Across our leaden evening life she moves; A golden star, beneath whose tender beams The shepherd of the shadow quietly Shall call us to our pens and fold us both In for the night. O Bertha, were this all, And had we hope of limping to our graves In peace, the girl would do. But hark! out there, The turbulent hoarse trumpet, the wild drum, The stained and shaggy pack of soldier wolves Raise hymns to Discord. Up, our armies, out: Stem back this cloud of furies! Ah, my queen, Our host is ready, who shall captain it? A girl! And is our house dwindled to this, Who nursed so many warriors in her day? Can Adelheid encase her limbs in iron? Steel gloves would strain her wrist and nerveless hand; Her long hair would not pack inside a helm;— And so the full sting of our loss bites home. O for a son, to back my battle steed, And make the air sing round my falchion's sweep! O for some kindred hand to catch this slave By his crisp beard, and toss him prone to earth, And trample on this hireling captain's head, This Conrad, whom my penury of boys Makes me endure detestable and trust With all my armies; though I read him plain Rebel in all but opportunity, Traitor in all but daring to rebel! BERTHA You lead whole funerals of weeping words Along the dusty purlieus of your past; And in their midst, as on a dead man's car Hung round with answerable garlands, lies One thought, which cannot speak with upturned eyes, The dreadful thing we dare not talk about, Or name out plainly yet. While, to divest Our minds of this dread image, which we bear, We wail aloud for others long since dead; And, with this hireling retinue of woe, These weepers paid to pull lip-corners down,— We deign to pitch our grief. O shame, my king! Turn round and face the bier, strip back its pall, Envisage close, peruse the lineaments Of this disaster. 'Tis a child pretence To bear it shrouded on its graveyard way, And by a tacit compact to pretend We carry nothing dustwards. SIGISMUND Bertha, Bertha, Give me a little time. I will be brave Soon. Do not chide me. I am nearly ready: Anger shall be my courage. Let the wave Break on me now. BERTHA Like a drowned foeman's face, The more we try to cram it under the flood, The more it rises up at us—and stares! So with this topic most detestable, It will recur—Good Sigismund— SIGISMUND I say, Tell me the news, for there is news. I am knit And resolute to hear it now: speak on! BERTHA Well, well, if you be calm— SIGISMUND So calm I am, That not this storm of tidings can unleaf One branchlet of my patience! BERTHA They have told you? Ah, but I feared they would. SIGISMUND There is no fear, I have not heard it! In the utter hush Just ere the auroral gale began to heave, Just when the doze lay sweetest at my heart In pulses of supreme beneficence Bland as an angel's feather—in it rolled A hustle and a clamour, at my head A scraping of great heels, and they flowed in, Scared varlets, rubbing open their dazed eyes, With one big word tripping their drowsy tongues, ‘Arnheim is lost, is sacked, is overthrown, Is fallen, is blazed into fine cinder-dust!’ Pealing the dismal changes like a pack Of bellmen, ‘dole, death, dust:’ roaring it out Above my pillow with no more concern Than if they haled a ploughman from his crib To quench his rick a-burning. By Saint Paul, To rouse a king so roughly was ill done: To crush in on me, like a cry of hounds, Without the prelude of one usher's knock, And snap my precious spell of morning sleep— Arnheim is lost! Why, lost then let her be: They might have surely let an old man doze! BERTHA And thou art wise, my king, who canst salute Tidings of harm with one calm ‘is it so?’ Why should we rave? why reach up hands at God To alter, which He cannot, yesterday? The lost is lost to angel as to man, The finger of their King alone is strong Now and to-morrow. Ah! no tear redeems Our little frontier town. My sole regret Is, that these ravens of ill-omened news Should flap across the morning we were wed: And I lament that almanacks next year Will have black crosses at its number set, And prick our feast for reprobation out, Changing its daring, ruby-lettered name Into a sentence like an epitaph. So shall they change our day, as its wreaths alter, Whose pale dry buds—I save them even now— Crumble to dust—and we shall follow them— Then is poor Arnheim lost! SIGISMUND Why, so she is; And I can say, ‘she is gone;’ and then sit down; And find we are fallen into a chiller year, And chafe my palms, and chatter trifling things. Only time has been—not so long ago— When at this news I should have hurled my limbs Into the saddle blindly with a roar. And dug my spurs in backwards, shaken reins And ridden charger after charger dead, Until, my armour flaked with blood and foam, And all my plumes caked close with dust and rain, I thundered on her gates with gloves of steel And dragged her back or died! BERTHA Love, be content; See, how you cough and shake! SIGISMUND Ah! town, my town, I played among thy streets: my mother died Up in the grey gaunt castle near the well And chestnuts. I have lost even her grave: Another kingdom's earth holds her, not mine; They might have left me this one cantle of grass, This turf or two of daisy roots. Gone, gone! Ah! Bertha, but indeed I loved the town; My little city clean as a child's toy, Set in a square with hooded corner towers And white bright walls, the turf swells up at them; Then in a heap the quaint dun-gabled roofs Crowning it all. Why, you could take it up Almost into the hollow of your hand. So snug it lies, compacted in its nook, Here where my crutch goes, in a scoop of pine-wood— For, you must know, the forest clings about it To north and east, borders and hems it in Most narrowly; till here the river swings Suddenly round the corner, sees the pines And plunges off among them with a wail— They must have bridged it since; but I recall Spitting a bayed red wolf where my shoe rests; We pricked him in the pines, he scambled down, And here he made his stand, and snapt and whined Against us in a crimson flash of tide. My Arnheim! No, their Arnheim! O my God! Leave me not rusting in this crust of age; Waken me up, flash anger into my brain; A poor old feeble king, hard on his grave, Dull, weary, almost blind; turning his cheek To any smiter. Out, hot tears, and flow At thy dishonour. In thy name thou art Monarch and great, but in all strength to save A phantom with a crown. For Arnheim weep; Ah, city, fair and lost—Who yielded her? Who flung her gates wide with such ready wrists? Whose hireling hand beckoned the alien in So easily? I scent Rebellion here, And Treason winds her finger in this web, Or never trust me more. All comes out plain. Traitors, it seems, are crawling round and in, Frequent as flies along our corridors. They will betray a mistress or a friend, A town, a king, a sister, or a secret, To any man who pays them well enough: Push greasy gold across their prurient palms, And they will cringe and smile and call thee god— Hounds of the gutter, kennel dogs, lean curs, Who will be-slaver any master's heels, Detestable. Ah, sweet saints up in heaven, Rend them and ruin their accursèd herd, Fall in blue forks and split their houses up, Singe all their faces like a bed of reeds, And let them burn, burn slowly and burn long! BERTHA Leave them to God and let these curses rest. SIGISMUND Let them beware, I say, let them beware! The aged lion is a lion still, Ay, and a king, and dreadful to his last; Although he roams the desert-side no more Among his tawny sons, but bides at home, Grey-golden, breathing thunder, in his lair. Let no man say, ‘He drowses, hath no harm, His fangs are worn away; turn in our dogs, And let us bate him like a village steer!’ BERTHA None deem thee thus; none dare to nurse this mind. SIGISMUND Nay, by those starry seven that watch the pole, You need not travel to the brink of the world, Or search the steep of Thule to unearth Such gracious vipers; native to this room They bask among our bedding, nest in floors, And honey-comb the palace as their own. I know them, and indeed you know them well; And some are courtiers, and a captain one, But adders, Bertha, adders all of them. Mark, how they slide about on audience days, Veiling their sneers at one old man enthroned With varnish of unwilling deference. They push about in careless unconcern, As if they were at market; they ignore The presence of the deputy of God; They loll against the columns quite at ease; They shrug, they nod, they whisper at their will, To inform the general herd below the ropes,— That, with protesting laughter in their sleeve, These gentlemen are good enough to come, And flash in radiant plumes along our halls. Still, while this moth of worm-worn palace fringe, This maggot of old velvet, Ceremony, Seals up their lips just now, let gestures speak And tell the honest rabble all they mean; Which would run thus could dumb thought gain a tongue: ‘Observe, good people, this is merely form: Be not deluded if we bow and cringe: We are content to pay a little show Of reverence to this regal dotard pair: Usage exacts this serious pantomime, And Custom, which is God to gentlemen, Says, so it has been, therefore let it be; And we obey: but notice well, good hinds, Who turn our furrows and crowd in to stare— We are your rulers, not this king of straw. He is our puppet: all his tapes and wires Are in our hand to tighten: showmen we Of this old majesty, this bunch of capes: We put him on a crown, set straight its rim. And wedge the sceptre ready for his fist: Then we arrange his mantle, drape its folds To mask the shrivelled kernel of the man. So, bravely he begins to shine in gold And purple. There he sits against the blue Like an incarnate sunset flushing gems: It is a pretty sight. No harm is done. The delvers are impressed, go home and dig The better, howl no more for civic rights, And with meek spades divide their cousin worms, Since they are clothed in fustian, he with Heaven! Not useless are these pageants, you observe; Merely remember, that one master hand Unseen doth dress the doll and deck the stage. The nerve and full prerogative of rule Rest and remain in our most righteous hands. We are the state, not this old spectre, we!’ BERTHA Why dost thou weapon crude Rebellion's lips With such an armed audacity of words? Who does thee wrong, my king? No soul of all. SIGISMUND O, they are mighty, captains of renown; They sit at home and wage big wordy wars— Why, such a feeble phantom as myself Could yield a town at the first bugle-call, As in their valour they with Arnheim did. But I will break the slumber of my age, And flash in panoply on Arnheim yet. We are none so broken as these boasters deem— O, we have supped with men on battle-eves, Who were as gods to these rash puny boys; Insolent boys, who gibe and dare not smite, Who fill my halls of peace with blaring words, And at the crack of danger crouch meek dogs; Who snarl and sneer. O God, wise God in rest, Breathe back into my arm its ancient iron; Fill me with lusty battle for a day; Sough off this scaly pestilence of age; Make me the man I was for one hour only To teach these children how their fathers fought Who thought no coffin sweeter for their bones Than, if they lost a citadel, to lie Under its fallen rampart; overthrown, Yet with no hint of shame upon their shield! O Arnheim, Arnheim! BERTHA Peace, my husband, peace! Our sorrow is our sorrow. But a king Should seem above the wound of mortal harm, And rear himself more upright in his chair, And nurse a prouder eye. He royalest Can mutely watch his once calm sea upcurling To such a head of hurrying tempest-wrath, That it must whelm and snap him like a reed; And yet with no lament can dumbly see His liquid grave swing on. SIGISMUND You bid me perish More tamely than a sheep. But wolves are round, And one lamb of my cities have they torn, So I will bleat and bleat. These raveners, Hearing me wail, may drop her from their jaws, For not a clown will budge! BERTHA Vex not thy soul. One finger only of thy realm is reft. One town thou art the poorer; no great woe, And nothing shameful. In the game for land Kings lose and win, like dicers tossing cubes, Lose one day, win to-morrow. Sup one eve With Crœsus, beg with Belisarius The morning after. Thou shalt win. SIGISMUND Enough Red earth to roof my face in silver rain, And keep my feet unfrosted in the snow, When I do sleep dishonoured. Let those rest Upon the pillow of whose dying bed Victory lays her chaplet; who have earned. Mighty in hand, their haven of repose. But I, the last page of whose clean-writ life Is blotted with defeat, how shall I doze Yet in my grave until my name be clean? Shall I desire to lay my harness by Amid this rumour of beleaguered towns, Loss and reproof? when traitors perch their nest, Like martins, flat against my window sills And in the hinges of my very doors, Breeding and sitting watchful;—when I wake To find that knaves have in the darkness shorn My kingdom of a limb; and no man goes To stanch her bleeding? If I had a son— My son is in his grave these many years, He keepeth bitter silence and is cold— Could he arise and ease my shoulder-blades Loaded with many burdens. Could he hear The laughter of the rebel as I strain And stumble, breathing hard,—I think the dead Would gather tear-rain in his dusty eyes, At such forlornness! To no living man Will I commend my sorrow. Look around; Holpen of none, abandoned, almost scorned, Whence shall we hope for love, whose ears are tired With empty deference of many mouths? Can we find one to trust, whom all obey? Who shall be worthy of our seat, our sword, And wear our empty robes when we are gone? Who shall weigh life and death as grains of sand, My doomsman with my signet on his hand, My frown across his forehead, almost mine The gesture, mine the voice? Who shall be son Of my hereafter? who shall woo a girl, And find a kingdom in a virgin's ‘yea,’ And raise, as monarch from her nuptial bed, Graft of my daughter's love, replacing us, With hurry of little feet, that patter down As rose-leaves from the rose's face? Whose brood Shall sit like little sparrows in the sand And watch the fountains? Whose this youngest bud, Who fills the dusty cradle covered up In the closed chamber where our baby died? Where is the prince of promise, where is he? Are his feet weary with the mountain glens, And doth he dally with the vineyard girls? Or laggard, on some river-island, turns His boat, and slumbers in the wild swan's home? One thing I know, our chosen is not here. I search the narrow faces round my throne, Between these apes and goats I cannot choose; There is no brow among the lordlings here Meet to sustain the intolerable load Of splendour in this irksome diadem, As consort to our child, king that shall be. But I take oath upon the cup of Christ, That men shall never stamp our ducats here With Conrad's hateful face. BERTHA What voice in the street, What cupboard whisper, what bird's note in the air Hath made thee harp on that? This man defamed Hath done thee service and shall do thee more. Thy soldier, watching for thy word, he slays. Thou callest on him, ‘Fight,’ and he fights well; ‘Peace!’ and he sheathes again his duteous sword. None lead men out as he does: no man's word Is better with the host. Regard, O King, Thine other captains; he, as Hesper, shines Among a flock of leaden clouds: he soars A golden drifting eagle of the foam Over the cackle of the hoarse grey gulls. As to our youngling daughter, this poor bird Would shudder at the clash of marriage bells; Leave her in freedom for a few more moons: If she has fancies—and all girls have some— She knows her duty and will lay them by In lavender with other childish gauds; When the right royal lover clatters in, With a cloud of plumes, barons and pursuivants, She shall say ‘Yes,’ if policy says so; And leave that blind attraction men call love To common girls and milkmaids. Adelheid Will give one sigh for Conrad and say, ‘Come, Royal and great and husband, I am here; The bride is ready, Come! Poor Conrad!’ SIGISMUND Plague And pestilence increase his poverty, Who is rich at least in dupes, who tire their arms By dressing up this traitor as a god— Ay, traitor; I do mean it; I speak plain, And teach how far a traitor, how untrue, How arm-pit deep in treason's pasty mire; While Loyalty, which should ascend to God, Benumbed by serpent fascination trails Its heavy wings: for all Kings under Christ Watch the great Python, who with hungry eyes Sits coiled beneath our thrones, to whom we toss Morsels and sops, when he puts up his flat Lean head and faintly flickers with his fangs,— And lull him back to sleep, whose bestial name Is Liberty; and many fools run mad At his faint hissing, which in crazy ears Sounds like the laughter of a mermaid's song; And this worm may have bitten Conrad's hand;— For I do know him sour and malcontent, Cruel and cold, bitter and bloodthirsty,— One measuring us daily with steel eyes, As if he chose the knife-spot. Ay, you wince, For this it comes to; neither less nor more— Brief would our session be, if Conrad's love Knew how to make its briefness shorter still. The love of my supplanter chides my stay: Away, old man, hide somewhere, out of sight! Hast then no refuge? Nay, not one: my heaven Is wanted for the young new star, my sea Suits a gold eagle of the foam. My land Alone remains, my spacious outspread earth: But here not less my rival's glory needs Such elbow-room, such freedom for its stride, That he would push me under with the mole, Lest, scarecrow-like, my insignificance Should vex him, as he swings along our meads— You do commend me a meek son-in-law— BERTHA There, out you flash again! SIGISMUND Great patient Lord, Hesperus, Osprey, Conrad—by what name We may approach thee unapproachable— We do confess that we are grown quite grey: We have been unmolested on our throne Too many days, so long. Thou hast forborne Divinely, deeply tried. O wax not wroth, O be not very angry, that we breathe And take our meat; Death is in fault, not we, Who have outpast the customary term. We know 'tis hardly decent to be here, And yet, young Phœbus, spare us! See, I kneel— BERTHA Have done: you are a child. SIGISMUND At which last word Another sorrow, thick as Hell, glooms out, To herald me such news as Œdipus Heard once at Thebes, and trod his crown in mire. But thou, our heiress, maid of many woes— Better be born of our least vine-dresser, Rather be cradled in a swineherd's hut, Than be one step in the ladder for this knave To scale up at the sun with; spurned away, When he sits supping in the golden halls; Heiress of evil, orphan of content— When we are in our graves! BERTHA Who talks of tombs? We yet can guard our heads; this shaft of sorrow Sings towards us, and we shelter till its barb Bite the dull ground and quiver harmless there. SIGISMUND You argue ill: the blind God mischievous Hath twanged his arrow to a hair's-breadth true. Laugh, if you list. You women are all one. I cannot simper at this inference; Our shrewd suspicion, almost certitude, That the detestable—I name him not— At the expense of half-a-dozen leers, And half-a-hundred gilded sugar-plums Of lover lies stale as the Deluge dove, Wins for his easy kingdom our meek child's Most unsuspicious bosom. O these girls Are won with feigning all days in the year— You hardly need put bait upon the barb, So briskly in all weathers will they come. Why should I break my heart with discontent About so stale a thing? God made girls fools For some wise purpose. With their shallow hearts An honest wooer will most poorly speed— A rogue of lies and tinsel always wins. And, since to name the sun brings out his beams, Here, nothing loth, our gentle treason comes Primed with disaster to the very beard. And, as first beadlet on his string of woes, Lo, he begins with Arnheim! Enter Conrad and Raban CONRAD King and great, Disaster needs no usher to thy throne, Peril and Death tread ceremony down, And at thy footstool we unbidden kneel, Arnheim and duty our excuse. Sire, Sire! Thy city is up, hot at her inmost heart With anger, and, astonished at this news, Wakes up, looks scared, and asks each passer-by, ‘Am I awake; or do I, dreaming, hear The chances of a dream?’ They toll the bells: No wagons swing along the public ways: None sell or buy; the market baskets stand Deserted; and the painted mountebanks Forget their poles, and crowd to read the news. Pale children, haggard women at their doors, Gather and whisper. In the public squares The men in noisy clusters, up and down, Discuss the portent, point, gesticulate; And, if a soldier passes, a low growl Tells him the solid burgher grows afraid For his fat bales at home. One cry goes out, That even now the spoiler on thy walls Is marching. As before him Arnheim fell, So shall this mother-city in his snare Be broken, be abolished. As I came, I heard a drunken fellow on a cask, Under a tavern-porch, wine on his face, Wine on his hands, sawing them emptily Over a swarm of boors, to whom he made Oration, roaring out, ‘Ye are dead dogs, One cometh with a halter for you all. Lap the sweet wine a little longer: none Drinks when the lips are worn off from his skull. Clatter your glasses to the King—King Death, Whose heralds are at Arnheim, cutting throats For the red yule-tide of their master's birth.’ So sings he out, and some catch up the cry, Of how the spoiler in his glory comes: As on between the clouds some golden light Rolls down the dawn; or, great with silver rains, A lordly river, swollen in its pride, Wipes at its tread the harvest-promise prone, And, on the hill-sides tearing, fills and fills The earth with deluge. If our Arnheim died At the mere lifting of his banner's wing, At the first crash in ether of his flutes, At the storm shaken from his trumpet tubes, Without one arrow sailing, one bow strung, How shall our gates resist his whirlwind arm? Arise, for it is time, our lords, and save us! SIGISMUND We thank them and their meek ambassador, It is a fair complaint.—Am I a god, To hold all sorrow from your doors and mine? To sweep the world clean of this cobweb Care Will be my duty next. Answer these hounds— They are not worth my saving, if I could; So they may yap and yell. Save such, indeed Hath no king ever lost a town before, That such a staring and a wailing crowd Should dog the hearse of this one? Save the boors! How save them? Is there magic in our robes? Or is our sceptre a diviner's wand, That all these mouths should roar and rate at us For being merely human? Are ye come, Revolters, disobedient, malcontents, At the first gleam of steel and crack of danger, Crowding as abjects round my purple knees? Must the King save you? Have you done your King Such service? Hath he profit at your hands? What tribute have you brought these many days? None, save that one sour berry from a tree Grown in your devil's garden, full of tares— The apple of death and treason. Have your bills In at the rind, and crunch it, kites and ganders! In your good days ye kick against my throne, More ready none to pluck its sides away, And tear its slabs up into breaches; when Sour Tribulation, bound about with flowers, Snores in the lap of Peace; while Goblin Fear Dreams at a barrel-head, and damns the King. But when each phantom wakens, rubs its lids, Hungrier, out of temper, from its sleep, Then, then begins their furious festival To tune of crackling villages a-glare, To light of leaping cloud in lurid globes, With mad complexities of moribund And wild-haired women, with long lines of girls In helter-skelter flying, who feel Death Come at their refluent ringlets, twisting in The stealthy fingers, ere his backward clutch— Then, when you cannot step in the street for dead, These cravens cry on me. Lo, then it comes, That to one goal they hustle, wrestle, crouch, Crawl on one point in heaps of prone despair, Toss themselves in before me, strew my floors, A jumbled sea of arms and writhing limbs, Come to be saved, healed, coaxed and comforted— Whither? By Chaos, to their mocked-at King! Can he, your ridicule of yesterday, Become the pivot of a reeling earth? Ye pray to one ye spat upon before To shield your faces and to save your hides, Because—he is paid to do it, being King, Else why should they maintain a King at all? They dare rush in and roundly tell me this— For all entreaty savours of command When they entreat. They bully when they pray, Saying, ‘O lord, the oppressor is coming on, The vale-heads tremble with his instant wheels, He reaches out his hand to rend our gates, His fingers almost scrape their brazen tires; Before him fans his breath as furnace-air, And in it we are shrivelled up and rolled Together as a beech-leaf. Now begins Thy duty, who art over us: array Thy battle, lead and vanquish, up, prevail! Wipe him away; snap off his charger's hoofs, Break up his chariot wheels, strike off his helm— Or else beware, a thing of greater fear, Our formidable curse!’ The curse of hares, Who mouth against the lion in his sand! These are my most obedient burghers, they Who, when their garners burst and teeth are tired, Will haggle with me on each silver disc And doit of tribute. Blunt and honest souls, Plain men are they. We tax them overmuch. Why should their sweat pay for a world of pageant, A costly court, a useless army too? They are plain folk, care not to pick their phrase. But only let a dozen helmets gleam Under the walnuts in a frontier pass, Their note is rarely altered. Ah, the sneer Becomes a howl of ‘save us!’ Curs, curs, curs! O, but they chafe and chafe me. ... You do well, Conrad, my lord, to let us largely hear, How the town gutters mock the palace vane! CONRAD O, Sire, dismiss this anger. We must act Before the dial creeps another hour, Or lose this city always. SIGISMUND Lose or win, How can they push this loss inside my doors? If my mere wish can save beleaguered towns, Which cranes, rams, ladders, arrows, catapults, And men with iron backs, like burnished flies In number and persistence, day and night Settle around and try to creep within— If such effect from my volition flow, I shall learn soon that 'tis my royal task To keep the demi-dead in hospitals Quick and alive, to redden leathern cheeks, To polish up lack-lustre filming eyes, To find new breathing cells for putrid lungs, To heal whole wards, lest if one cripple die The rabble roar, ‘Depose him!’ CONRAD In this view Thy hands are clean, my King, of Arnheim's fall! The event came on us like a sudden knife, Too swift to catch the assassin at the wrist. Hearten us, King, in saying, ‘So it was: All rumour else is idle. God came down And smote this city from us at a blow.’ The shepherd wakes in vain, if, as of heaven, A sudden blot drops earthwards out of the sun, Strikes down through air, that sings as to a sword, And rises up an eagle with a kid. If in this way the foeman's iron heels Fastened on Arnheim, we, thy remnant herd, Reproach thee nowise for the missing lamb. But there are whispers, and disloyal ones,— Rumours which make allegiance mutineer,— How, faint with famine, half her garrison On crutches at the loopholes, eating rats And drinking tainted wells, day after day She wrote for succour; and each morning rose, And yet her iron girdle narrowed in, But no help came. Once more she wrote, and fell Cursing—ah, whom? Forgive her; she is dead! SIGISMUND Now, by my sword, this moves my soul to flame. Beautiful Arnheim, did they leave thee, then, To wail aloud so long in agony? Could thy tear pluck no dastard from his chair In my great comfortable hall? Would none Turn out into the whitened roads austere, And ride their faces red against the flakes? And these are—well, God save the mark—my soldiers, And not a bevy of white dancing girls Who play at mock assaults with bullrushes ... I am the worst served monarch in the world, And the most disobeyed. ... By God's own cross, I do adjure you, Conrad! Raban! all! Why did no succour march? CONRAD By Christ his tree, I, King, reply that, till this morning, pealed No hint of Arnheim's peril on my ears. For aught I knew, our northern frontier lay Still as a child is with a cherry bunch. RABAN They say, the townsmen sent a piteous scroll, That should have groaned if parchment had a voice. SIGISMUND Is Arnheim's letter melted into air? RABAN Melted or lost! They say his wits are both, The loon, who brought this sorrow in his pack; Who rode and rode, until the land grew dark Before him, fainting at thy palace gate, Blind from the saddle. Some one picked him up, And wisely put him into hospital, Where now he most uncomfortably raves; Wits has he none to speak of, yet avers That, ere his mind went, some one left thy gates And drew the parchment from his feeble gripe, Saying, the King should see it presently. And now—being merely madman—he enquires If ‘presently’ means ‘never’ here at Court? SIGISMUND Who bade you speak? RABAN My lord, I am reproved, And kiss thy footstool! SIGISMUND Thou, a crippled scribe, Born in my stable, littered with my dogs, To speak so pertly, when these gentlemen, Leaders and lords, are in this audience dumb. ... As for this letter ... it is surely lost. ... And yet how lost ... our judges shall enquire. ... Now for the town: ride, Conrad, hurry and ride: Take men, men, men: my army—take it all. Do what you will; you are named General. Be absolute as I am in this war: Hurry and ride: I gird my sword on you; Redden it well and bring it home: ride, ride— You will get Arnheim once again, good Conrad— I say you will—now go. CONRAD It shall be done. [Exeunt Conrad, Raban, and Captains. SIGISMUND Let me get air and breathe. ... Are they quite gone? I am well rid of them ... the pack may ride To Erebus; I care not. Hearken, sweet, I was in peril, yet I baffled them— Warily, ay. Thank Heaven, I hold a brain: That Raban nearly nosed my secret out. Indeed, I made a kind of slip. ... Saints, kings, St. Peter, David, suffered lapses each. ... Well gone are they. How shall an old man keep A clear, cool head in this new whirl of time? A tinsel age of mock and make-believe, Of strange wants and reverberate emptiness! But in my father's days a King was King, Able to feel his feet and have his way With reason or no reason, wrong or right: That I call reigning: but these modern ways Of asking leave and ducking to the crowd Disgrace the ermine. If thou be a King, Bear a King's nature: art thou reptile born, Crawl on contented in thy wormy rings. Had I but ruled in those gone, worthy days I had built my throne into such adamant, That, when we had grown old as we grow now, Not one mere slip due to these failing eyes Should shake its fabric like a weanling's toy! BERTHA Speak out, my King: deal not in devious phrase: Hast thou misread their letter craving aid? Safe ears are mine and faithful. SIGISMUND Hearken then— Bury this secret in sepulchral lips Never to come again out at the air. When Arnheim wrote ... come nearer, lean thy ear .. Thus it befell ... did you hear something move Behind yon curtain'd door? Up! Fling it wide ... No one? The wind among our tapestries Is like a mocking bird, and takes the sound Of feet and heavy breath and crumpled gowns. Well, caution, best of watch-dogs, oft must bark At nothing. .. You shall hear it from the egg Without more prelude. Know, these untried boys Sneer at the pilot, whose worn heavy eyes Guide on the vessel through the floating miles Night after night; while they in easy beds Dream of the shore and curse the laggard keel, He must watch always, wakeful, unrelieved, Threading the myriad perils of their path. At length the harbour: cabled to the side Safe rocks the ship: out they leap: hurry home: Who turns to thank the helmsman? Surely none. Grateful? Not they: this loon was paid to steer; And, though they might have provendered the shark And supp'd the dog-fish, if his eyes had closed— Who now fears drowning, sure of steadfast earth? But if a little thorn of twinkling rock, Undotted in a chart of devious seas, Scratch out a plank or drill an eyelet hole In the good timbers of our floating home, Whereby these drowsers in the cabin find Salt in their mouths, and Neptune gushing chill Round their warm berths. On whose devoted head Do execrations thicken? Rend and tear The silly pilot. To a man the crew Rush up and rate him, author of their bale. Dismiss the parable and learn the fact— Upon a certain night, when three or four Great stars begin to rule the vacant heaven; They, that is some one, cram a paper in Beneath my palace gate. No fool of mine Informs me whence it came, who wrote its lines; My pursy seneschal, dull as a mule, Pompously enters, sets the missive down, Bows and retires with a flourish of his leg. I take the bundle up and scrutinise; I find its seals are difficult to rend, That it bemires my fingers with red mud, That, even as I clasp it, warmth exudes Yet from the haste of some ignoble hand; I shudder and I set it down to dry. O, I supposed it naught; some petty wrong; Some boor, who beat his fellow in a ditch About a freckled wench or glass of ale; Whereon, the weaker and the worsted hind Must have at least a royal arbiter To salve his bruises and restore his trull. Add, that the missive came at my dull hour Inopportunely; when my senses ache, And I am chiefly drowsy, mad for rest. Who shall impeach me, if I thrust the scroll Yet unperused beneath my pillowed head? That night I slept, a miracle for me, As soundly as a woodman or a girl; The bundle lulled me like a sack of hops. Night passes; and a budget of new cares Clamour with dawn against my bedroom doors, And, ere I well be wakened, cry, ‘Hear us!’ So in the crush and jostle of affairs, Which strive for audience in my kingly mind, This one poor letter is unheard, thrust out, And sheer forgotten.—Now my breast is clean And I am sad. Alack and well-a-day! Sure I am old: do I deny my age? I will not be perused with such blank eyes: What have I done to draw these glances out? Bertha, say something: look not thus at me: Make some reply. Why, many scores of towns Have sent appeals and letters by the ream In the long years of my most weary reign To which I gave no answer; and no brick Has loosened out of any of their walls For my anterior silence. It is strange And pitiful. Thy arm, my Bertha; come: No hint of this to Conrad: let us go. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. A dimly-lighted Corridor in the Palace. Conrad alone, waiting. CONRAD Will my sweet come? Listen! I think, I hear The singing of her robe along the ground, As the whisper of a far-off little wave Crisping and trembling at the lip of land— It rustles there! Alas, it comes no more; The arras swings, and the old elms outside Brush their harsh leaves together. The grey roofs Pipe through their crannies to the floating moon. Indoors, small breezes, like belated children Of that large full-blown storm-blast in the air, Roam, whining down deserted passages; And seem to cry aloud upon their father, Some giant in the moving mist, who rocks The onward cloud,—howl out on him to feed them; Who, eagle-like, in the havoc rides, and seeks Some airy prey to bring his bantlings home— I wait in vain. Fantastic images Swarm on my soul's impatience. All is still; Yet on the buzzing air I forge her footsteps, And conjure the extremity of silence Into the sound which Love's most hungry ear Pines after, till it draws into itself The echo of a nothing. Adelheid, Come, or I perish! How the ticks of time Swing on their slow and laggard pendulum Dragging the hateful seconds out to years! Will she come never? Ah, some chance of Hell Has caged her in from coming. See, she beats, Dove-like, in vain her little wings to come, And strains her bright breast on the door of wire, And wounds her throat against the flimsy grate That holds her in from love and larger air! O had my hand its rending! Come, O come, I faint with asking God to send thee soon: My lips burn with petition, and my eyes Glaze with delay. It is thy very time: And yet I hear no rustle, nor discern Under the dim lamps, moving like the moon, My queen in her great golden hair. All still! Yet the blood maddens and races in my veins; I can hear nothing; yet she must be near. She will come. [Adelheid enters. ADELHEID Conrad! CONRAD Darling! ADELHEID Look at me; You bear no wound? CONRAD Not any. ADELHEID O, thank God! CONRAD I have no scratch of iron. ADELHEID I could weep I am so blest. My soul is so surcharged With benediction, that, as a wood-blossom Whose cup is heavied with excess of dew— She leans it over and spills some drops of it. CONRAD Thus will I brush aside this happy rain, And never give you any time between For tear-shedding. My love, with feet of down, How could you creep to me and come unheard? I found you at my side: you have coaxed silence To strew your path with wool: I caught your footfall No more than a bird's wing upon the air. ADELHEID The echo of the drums around your brain Have beaten out my steps. CONRAD They did not so; Thy step, thy voice, thy form, thy pictured eyes Went out to battle with me; and endured, Like presences of quiet heaven near one, Who stumbles on the sulphur crust of Hell, And beats the swooping demons from his head. For the mid fight ran every way as foul, When Mars on many thunders splashed and roared Among a horrible coil of wounded limbs, And maimed distortions: who, as severed worms Drag ghastly bulks a few red inches on, Crawled, and lay prone, and quivered, then were still. There the unwholesome sun, like some vast star With edges strangely blurred and copper face, Melted meteorous on the side of heaven, And from its rent and ragged under-rim Seemed to drip foully out upon the clouds: While on the verge an awful luminous haze Thickened and sickened upwards from the field— Like steam and breath of fighters, quick and dead— Not very high this vapour swayed in flat And heaving strands; turned like a heavy wave Rolling and yellowed; as some river is When flushed with loam at flood-tide from torn fields. And in that lurid twilight wrought and raged The fight with onset after onset, till All its hoarse noises at a clap flared out To sudden silence, dreadfuller than sound. Then we drew breath; and, lifting up our eyes, Searched the expanse of death from north to noon, And saw its surface dotted with great forms Shining; who, as they bent to wipe their swords, Flashed fairly once or twice like golden stars: But seemed mere scythemen cleaning scythes of dew In a morning meadow peaceful. For it all Looked most unreal, like an acted fight, Or a dream movement, soon to snap and end. Then went there out a whisper we had won. Then some leant panting on their stainèd spears; Some flung them down to sleep, some stared wide-eyed Upon their fellows: one man gratingly laughed For very shiver and sadness—such a laugh In such a silence, pathos in it past All pitch of groaning. Thus we drew long breaths. Round us the battle lay like roods of plough, Haze in their outskirts, in their furrows death. And I arose to count their loss and ours, And roamed from group to group, saying, ‘Well done.’ Till in my round I reached where they broke earth In the easy sand of an old torrent bed, And scooped two parallel wide ditches out For the last service a man needs, who till That brink be reached for much plagues men and God. And here I found them, busy as black bees, The white-cowled priests and waist-stripped grave-diggers, These with the slain, these with the demi-dead, Whispering, digging, praying, shovelling. The gaping trench lay handy for its guests, Half full already: thick within its sides They lay pinned down, like dead sheep in a ditch, With a snow of quick-lime on their brow and hands, Till the next layer of death packed over these Should mask them out of sight, and stamp them down, Done with for ever. And for pity of them Mine eyes began to glisten, and the soldiers Began around to whisper, and I was shamed; When it rose on me wave-like, all at once, Thy thought, my darling; and I told my soul, That could I change places with one poor knave, Whom at that instant I saw shovelled in, With wide lip and eyes earnest in their films, Whose most enduring hatred twisted in His long nails cat-like in a foeman's hair— So that for want of time to free the twain They shot them in together. ‘Ah!’ said I, ‘If hate out-last the rigour of the end, Shall love be weaker? Let the wretch lie there, Who would debase the eldest-born of heaven, By such a blasphemy of unbelief.’ Nay, were I him, so rolled into my grave, I know that my last thought which caught at time Would steep itself wholly in Adelheid; I know the last convulsion of my lips Would make the name in moans out if I could, As I slid down those brinks to my death-place In the pit, my dark hot grave! ADELHEID Ah, Conrad, peace! You slay me with such syllables: have done. CONRAD Ah! but indeed I thought so— ADELHEID God has laid That woe behind us. You are surely come. That is enough, you are safe: I hold you here. I might have also died had you been slain. I think, I must have shortly followed you, Like a poor child who goes wild in the dark, Losing the comfort of one candle flame With whose companionship, it only dared Sanely to face the circumambient gloom. CONRAD And were you then so anxious? ADELHEID Let that pass: The sorrow of it is over and over well. I have prayed and cried—so much. CONRAD The track of tears Has worn the gracious colour from your face; I note it somewhat wasted since I went. You are gone pallid as the fleecy cloud That cushions morning's star. In your regard The echo of your lover's danger lives Still written white in rose-loss. ADELHEID That comes back On the wing of the blush which, now you kiss me, darling, Repairs the past: see, am I altered now? I shall spoil all and weep. CONRAD O eyes of rain, Your dew-drenched rays are precious in my sight, And you are more than lovely so bedimmed With pity of my absence. Should I care To hear my little bird had chirped as well While I was gone away? ADELHEID In my cage here I drooped and not a note came. Out a-field O'er lengths of clover late incarnadine Shivered a line of equal-mounted larks. The jay dodged grating in and out the dells. The mutinous republic of the rooks Scolded the rising beam. Above the dome, Thrice nearer heaven than its top pinnacle, I saw a giant bird take northward wing, And to my heart I said, he goes to Arnheim Scenting the slain of the great battle there— And that dread thought held me quite dumb all day. CONRAD He did not tinge his talons in this heart Which is my darling's. Did you credit him With such a dismal errand for his flight? Nay, silly one, you did. ADELHEID It was so sudden: You were here—you were gone—no leave-taking: Then the suspense of sitting with clenched hands, To count the limping seconds, till they told me You were among the heroes or the dead. CONRAD I am returned, so kiss— ADELHEID What hast thou brought me? CONRAD Honour! Nothing but this. On that red field No other morning flower had leave to grow. Some of its leafage I have brought thee home; See, dove, a wreath; if thou art caged here, hang it Against thy wires. I think some men have died In reaching after worse wreaths for their loves. ADELHEID I never bade thee go and gather such. CONRAD Are they not lovely when between our hands? ADELHEID The bloom is honey and the berry death. So my nurse told me, when my child-lips craved That pretty thing called shadow of the night. CONRAD Is glory such—my glory? ADELHEID God forefend! I jested only, lest my happy eyes Should over-brim their silly fountain brinks. Is not thy Fame my fairest earthly good, Except thy Love? One hems me round as air, With subtle, soft, unseen investitude; That is thy Love. Thy Fame works otherwise; This, evident as the fire-fingered Sun, Fans out each liquid branch of trembling gold And bathes my temples with irradiate threads. One makes me live, the other makes me sing! CONRAD Have I done well then? Of all maiden mouths I wish those lips to kiss me with their praise. ADELHEID Hero and Love, in thy new glory hail! How beautiful thou art in laurel leaves, Returned most welcome. CONRAD Thou hast lifted me On wings with thine approval. ADELHEID Shall I hide My joy that thou art famous? Folks in the street Are loud upon it. Noisy market-wives, And sicklemen at swarming tavern-doors, And hinds who rub down horses sibilant— All toss thy name about; blind mendicants Chatter about thee o'er their blinking dogs Broiling upon the pavement, where the fountain Cools the great square in vain. I do believe Its stony nymphs and stucco triton soon Will take the tale up and appraise thy deed; Since with one throat the land says only ‘Conrad,’ And all lips meeting mould this common sound, Except one lady's. She—she dare not breathe That name, which in the casket of her heart Long time lay guarded. No one knew the gem, Or that it was a jewel, save herself, Now all proclaim it for a princely pearl; And yet she may not say, ‘So knew I always’; And only midnight corridors shall hear She cares to see thee great. For she must creep, And whisper out love—as some wretch divulging Crime in the ear of heaven's confessional, With low short respiration, hurrying words, And wild eyes turning sideways at the doors, As though he feared their panels to unroll And toss his victim in, bleeding and tied White in its grave-clothes. With no braver heart I watch here in the shadows and the sounds. I am routed at the footsteps of the wind, And, if a lamp-flame leaps, my blood stands fast. By Heaven, this fearful wooing shames my race; A milk-maid in this fashion should be won At hide and seek between the twilight stacks. But otherwise the heiress of a realm Should render love in such a regal way, As the Moon lays her halo on some cloud In the grey heaven, regarded of all stars, In a great modesty of shameless light Bathing her cloud Endymion with bright dew Of silver kisses; as the woods, and towns, And crisping ocean inlets and round meres Gaze up and give her worship as she burns. CONRAD Child of the many kings, I have presumed Beyond my mean deservings. Who am I To wrap the taint of my eclipsing baseness Around the meteor sweetness of thy way? All is amiss, and all the guilt is mine; Reprove, reproach me, though thy chiding voice Hurts in among my heart-chords like a blade, And sprinkles on these weather-broken cheeks Some girlish dew. Would the grim battle-God Had made one swing at Arnheim with his net, And dragged me to his silent river-shore, Whereby he sits and sorts into his buckets The gasping nations of the newly-dead;— Ere I had lived to shame thee coming home With these vile limbs unwounded. O my queen, Who from the rabble of mean men, no more Than they who scrape the earth-face for their bread, Wouldst catch me up into the rosy clouds With thy celestial preference, there to keep State in their purple loved of gods and kings;— I have repaid thee with a fair return To drag thee down instead into my clay And soil thee with vile secrecies. O sweet, Let us take oath and hand somehow to mend This flinty pathway of our shame-faced love, Whereby he crawls dishonoured, with veiled head, And brows afraid of morning. ADELHEID Mend it now, Ere men forget to laud thee. Thine this hour: Ask, as thou standest on its gleaming floor, With such ripe honour bound about thy helm, With such a blush of conquest on thy cheek, With such a surging triumph at thy heels, Such retinue of throats intoning praise,— What suitor with such urgencies behind Ever went home unanswered? Ask and win: The dial of thy glory points at noon; Ask, for the utmost burnish of the day Endures a moment only. Never or now Press to the audience chamber, boldly speak. None dare refuse thee, who to-morrow may. Ask with thy lips hot from the battle-breath, And wed me in the sight of priest and king, Hero of Arnheim, worthy to ascend And sit beside me, husband, in bright robes, Inheritor and partner of my power In those dumb years which are not born, but shall be As steeds to draw the chariot of our reign. CONRAD I will consider. ADELHEID O my love, beware! For Gratitude no longer than the moon Keeps full and fat, both soon grow shallow-breasted; Yet wasting Luna can repair her outline, And build her time-eroded circle up; Not so poor shrunken Gratitude, she starves For good and all. Her lean sides ne'er re-fill. CONRAD Then I will speak— ADELHEID And speaking you shall win; I seal you thus for second victory. [Kisses him. Farewell, be brave, my darling, and prevail. [Adelheid goes out. CONRAD Gone like the shadow of a rose petal, When the great mother-flower dissolves in fragments Her o'er-expanded beautiful great heart; And all the garden-side is saturate With the incense of her ruin. Gone, my rose, Treasure of April, gone! Why then the air Is subtle with thy presence. Let no hand Move till the echo of thy richness dies.— [A pause. So she is gone; and I remain a fool Fantastical with love, whose mouth drops over With wreaths and rose-buds. Am I surely Conrad, The mercenary Conrad, fierce at heart, The scholar in the blood-school of the world, Who hacks for any king, and laps up lives As thirsty dogs will water? Must this wolf Lick the pink sandal-tip of one meek child And caper in her chains of daisies wound To the pipe of the enchanter, call him Lust Or Love, I care not, he has fooled me so, I am not nice to name him nicely? Mars Is not so fell, and brews of discord less Than this mild cheat, mock god of whining girls; His white fingers unclose like water-lilies To beckon on ravenous ranks of spears, Close as a pine-wood's boles or bulrush beds, The heads of whose advancing shafts divide Into a stream of stars the steady sun. This is God Love, whose hand is weak as rain, Whose touch is tender as a cowslip's cup; Pitiful Love, at whose hest armies slay; Who weeps and gives no quarter, whose least whim Sprinkles dead faces in a wide grass land Thick as the windfalls on an orchard floor. Or as a newly-shaven meadow lies With all its foolish speckled tulip-heads Prone in the math. I cared no feather, none; It mattered not one down of thistle beard To me if Arnheim stood or Arnheim fell. I heeded not whose ring was round her throat; If, as our frontier watch-dog or the foe's, She bayed and strained the tether of her chain. I cared none either way: my trade is war. Let old kings sleep, and famine open gates And turn the virgin city prostitute; I wail not over such a common chance. It will be good for fighting and bring grist To that great mill of onset which I turn, Having no land: my sword is any man's: They call me mercenary, hireling, here; Let the name stick; I shall not alter it: I smite down three while patriots push at one. They lose their cities, I recapture them; Such service is not readily forgiven. They take revenge in—such an epithet! Hireling indeed! What fighter for mere hire Would tilt into this Arnheim, stuffed with foes, With a few horsemen at his back? This ride Savours of madness more than money greed. I wear the livery of this king; I sign Compact to carry arms against fair odds; Doth that bring obligation to go out And fight a legion single-handed? Nay. Yet in the teeth of death, of my free will I chose this venture. Why? O lame response! Because a certain girl named Adelheid Would think me a fine fellow if I won. SCENE II. The Audience Chamber. Sigismund; Conrad. SIGISMUND Room for the victor. Lord of Arnheim, hail! CONRAD I kneel before my monarch, and salute Humbly the hand that gave my hand its sword. SIGISMUND I greet thee, prince of captains, and accord, With much fair love, the audience thou hast craved. We thank the saviour of our frontier town. Our royal lips, unused to such a sound, Do not disdain to say, we owe thee much. The thanks of kings are given reluctantly Once in a hundred years; like aloe flowers, They sit upon the rock, which is their throne, Nor care to show the light their inmost heart, And nurse in thorny foldings their reserve— But rise, my captain; rise, and kneel no more. I augur some petition by thine eyes: Is it not so? Thou colourest! Ah, well; We great kings of the earth are never served For simple loyalty and hearty faith, Who do the right with no eye on reward To follow. So it was in the old days. Now the crown buys obedience: that's no news. We traffic in our kindness; love by scale, And borrow duty at high interest. Nothing in that: the trader's heavy shoe Treads on the royal buskin; merchandise Elbows religion to the ditch; our peers Shoulder the packs of pedlars, and appraise Allegiance as the buttons on a coat— And now thou comest: ask and have, and go! CONRAD Now, by thy sceptre, King, thou hast misread The fashion of my asking. If my prayer Were ducats and more ducats, I could phrase Glibly enough petition for a sack Of such and such dimensions. Any fool Can ask for bread or money; else ere this Half of thy land were dead of hunger pangs. But this my suit is halt, and lame of tongue, Heavily trips, and will not come in words, And on thy doors knocks with a clumsy hand, And cannot tell its name. SIGISMUND You want reward; And kings reward men in a hundred ways. Choose from this century your recompense. Why should your preface, like a blushful girl, Stand craning at its wish? CONRAD If it be well That royal masters measure recompense, Bringing the good we do them into poise With the reward demanded, set the scale, And toss this Arnheim on, thy kingdom's key, Weigh in the risk, the weather, many dead, And estimate the deed. SIGISMUND You have done well For a young soldier well, and well again. I do not blame your valour, but your youth, That in your random onset I discern No settled system and no battle plan, And miss all tincture of stragetic lore. Yet you did well; for in you stoutly rode With a wild flash and crash of deafening drums; Out came your swords: ‘Charge,’ said the trumpet peal. So done; you laid about you, carte and tierce, Hip to haunch, beard to chin, steel crossing steel, Until they yielded, more surprised than hurt. O, you did well—a thought too rashly, indeed, If I must fix my finger on a flaw;— But the event atoned empiric war. Fortune, who loves beginners, smiled you on. Well, I disparage nothing; win by rule First, if you can, but win at any cost. And we have won, with all deductions made, A pretty victory enough, except— But never mind exceptions; they can keep: And you deserve a festival to-night, And in the morning you shall have reward— Proportionate reward. CONRAD If I should say, King, I had set my heart to ask of thee Coined bullion, bars of treasure, silver cups, Nobles, and marks, and angels, and bezants— Why—you would give me some, send me away With both arms full, and finish with my suit. But of such dross, I answer, give me none; But certain gold, more golden than our mines Possess; some treasure of such priceless gleam, That never yet the storehouse of our kings Its equal held! SIGISMUND An eloquent demand! My captain is become an orator: The great mute Memnon of our puny wars Hath seen some rosy-silver Dawn in heaven To which his hand would reach, his heart would climb, And through the silence of his stony lips Pours unaccustomed music, chord on chord. CONRAD Sir, you are right: the Dawn, the Dawn it is That I desire. For never in his waste Did that old Æthiop idol watch the grey Cloud galleries grow fiery from behind With her rich rising that is Queen of dews, Who wraps her glittering shoulders in a robe More amber than the cowslip's;—never did That tawny giant-child of sunrise yearn With hungrier eyes upon his mother's star Than I await her coming, who to me Is morning-beam and music. O my King, Her beauty smooths these rugged soldier lips: On such a theme the blunt mouth of a fool Could cope with those old mighty lords of language, Who strove with Philip and with Catiline. Perfection needs no preface of my praise To seat the highest in the world up higher; And Adelheid, my princess, my beloved, Loves me again— SIGISMUND You rave to tell me so! Fury and storm light on my palace roofs, Crack them and let the wild rain batter in! Insolent boy—lest your blood stain this hall, Out and begone: my sworded arm on high Wavers; creep out beyond its reach and run. CONRAD Smite, King, my breast is ready, and smite sure, Lest laurel of thine Arnheim turn the edge. SIGISMUND I have heard wrong; unsay this quickly and go; Sounds are uncertain in my aged ears— Some echo in the rafters, God knows how, Carried to me such daring syllables, That I beheld a madman with a chain Among the tombs as speaker—no, no, no! Conrad forget his duty and speak thus? I tell you nay. He never dared! CONRAD He did, O Sire; and once again, ready for fate, He must repeat the perilous sweet words: ‘I love her,’ is a sentence like a flower Swaying its head, a leaf on either side. I speak it clear, and I can merely die With these three words laid sweetly on my tongue; And no king's hand or frown can hinder me. In this all rulers are most impotent, To make men love at order or desist From love by proclamation. Love obeys The edict of no mortal emperor. Love and his saints all worship; she is one, My Adelheid, and I to her may bend Uncensured; and none aureoled in love's choir Is purer with more whiteness; save that she, This adoration, still abides on earth, And being with us is more pitiful, And nearer to the worship of our lips, Than her sky sisters—nearer, not less fair. Hence, in her ruth she hath not yet dissolved Her hair into a garland of crips stars, Hath not withdrawn her beauty into cold air Beyond where planets take their pastime, still Is here and draws all love into those eyes Bluer than wells where round rosed angels sit Under a wood of roses! SIGISMUND Braggart hound, Be dumb. You push presumption to its hilt. Avoid my sight—you torture me—away! Better my girl were gone and in her grave Than I should sit in abject greyness still, And hear thy coarse lips praise and catalogue Her pure perfections. Can I keep her name Clean, if all knaves may mouth it as they will? Who gave this mean apprentice of the drum License to judge my daisy? Once I saw A scavenger pick up a fallen rose; He turned its faint leaves over with foul hands, Examined, ruined, soiled, and tore it half, So flung it from him with a shoulder-shrug, And went on carting carrion and rank sludge; And this he understood, but not the rose. Wherefore, my master, you who tell me straight That you will chirp this princess at my ears, Whether I will or will not, all the same,— Listen—I give you but a little word And then much silence. You remind me well That no king's sceptre ever quelled or broke The salt imaginations of a man. Worms creep inside the temple doors of God, And lay their slime along the holy cups And burrow in the bread. Then comes the priest And smears them to the pavement with his heel. Vengeance is done, but still pollution cleaves Around the altar; their enduring harm Survives their paltry death and instant end. So might I— CONRAD Ay, so might you, King, and once Again so may you never. Words are idle, And I have done. When men are full of bread The sower of the harvest is forgot. SIGISMUND Have I not hired you, man, to tread my field And shed the seed of war? Then dare you come And prate and haggle when the ear is full, And sell the very harvest off my roods To me its master? And it comes to this— To-day you ask my daughter, and to-morrow My crown as aftermath of benefits; And so I pay for one lean victory Denuded to a stalk of all my leaves Of honour. Down, all kings, upon your knees And pray to be defeated. What poor king Can keep a decent mantle round his hips Under the clutch and importunity Of such victorious captains? God, my God, Let me be very patient with this knave! I will disdain to spend one fiery pulse Of anger on his slavish head. Go forth, Chafe me with no reply. CONRAD I leave thy face, And ponder on the gratitude of kings In silence; and hereafter as my wage Shall be my service. SIGISMUND Hear this sword-monger, Who sells his valour, bargain! He will bleed So much on such a quarrel and no more. A ducat's hero and a stiver's dastard, As he is paid. O hear him! this is Mars, Who measures valour with a huckster's ell, And honour on the inches of a stave. And, since I underpay this son of fame— Good—he will budge no more, but let my towns Tumble and crash, while he sits lolling near And smiles, ‘I told you so.’ Am I then grown So feeble, demi-dead, irresolute, So crazy in my chair, so out of gear, That you must vent your ironies on me, Sneer at my silver and anointed hairs, And mock me to my face, my bondsman, you, My slave, whom I have clothed and fed to wage The battles of my house? As certain dogs Are fed to turn my spits or guard my doors, Do these come when my joint is roasted well, And whine to be rewarded with my child? But young Sir Valour cannot save a town— Which succour is his duty, nothing grander— But he must rate with princes for the deed, And mate with grand princesses purple-born! Mad with the pride of winning one small field, The wide earth and its increase must be his, By right of that large impudence, which likens A blind mole pushing up a little earth In a wide plain gazed over with great hills; While, in its own conceited estimate, This thing, which sees two inches past its nose, Is Titan piling mountains up at heaven, To get among the gods and wrench their thrones— And you shall never climb into my seat, Whose ancestry bores but with shallow fang Beneath the deep-earthed past, wherein the autumns Of many rotting generations mingle, And whose successions mock immeasurable The newly-gilded leaf, that swings to-day Brave in its little summer. And you dare To this great hall, where kings on kings have sat In the dim years, my fathers, judging men, Push in and vapour out your paltry claims, Who are of nothing, whose ephemeral race Became ennobled somehow yester-year— A mushroom house, rank from the rotten ground, And savoured with the mixen, where its spawn Found orifice to hang with leathern gills, And fester fly-blown ere two evenings old! You, lineaged with a scanty train of sires, Two counts and then a warehouse, and beyond Kith at the wheel and kinsmen at the loom, For all God knows! You, neither more nor less, Must come in roundly, hitch me by the sleeve, Nod and begin, ‘I want your daughter, sire, Here, now, to-day; so you may ring the bells And bid the bishop gird his cassock on: The maid is royal, but who now counts that? These rules of caste are growing obsolete. In fine, I like the princess—that's enough, Who am Achilles, Rowland, Amadis, Stour Hercules and Lancelot in one— And, if I need a thing, who dare say no? Not one old king, whom we shall shovel soon Under the flags of the cathedral floor;— Whom, dead and done with not a sand too soon, I shall succeed, by merit of my own And in the right of this pale rose-leaf thing, His daughter; whom, indeed, I tolerate And greaten with bestowal of my hand; Since such a consort planes my upward road, And snuffs out certain cousins of the blood, Who might become pretenders in my path And shall inherit silence; lest they gibe, When I with gracious ease, robed out a king, Lead Adelheid in one hand to divide The dais awning; bow me left and right, Adjust a certain unaccustomed cap, And nod the signal to a well-packed hall To roar “God save King Conrad!” Shallow fool, I will rip out your thoughts for men to read, And teach the laughing nations how Conceit Postures itself in fancied diadems, And trails along in purple robes of air. My hours may be as brief as you desire, Yet in that briefness I have time enough To chide presumption. Never shall you set A burgher scion in our royal boughs; Therefore, begone; yet with free limbs depart, Because our wrath is mild and merciful. Worthy of many fetters, chainless go. Out of my sight at once: in case I change My clemency, let that rebellious brow Keep exile from our audience, lest I shear Its head, which only Arnheim saves to-day! [The King goes out. CONRAD Upon the board of fate the die has rung, And I rise up a beggar from the game: I who came in full-handed with the coin Of many noble deeds, pass out ashamed, With pouch and pocket empty as the blind Heart of a fool; wherein, if one store kindness, And at a pinch reclaim deposit thence, He finds mere broken benches and an echo Of selfish laughter. Yesterday's rich man, I sit to-morrow ragged in the ditch, And see some new and paltry god of the hour Ride by with roaring throats and streaming flags As I did. Why the market-wives pressed in To pat the very charger I bestrode, And grandams wrestled madly for a niche Whence to discern the feather in my helm. Then all the town, as some vast swarming hive, Buzzed in my wake. Such praiseful echo clashed Around me, that the casements shook like reeds Beside my path of triumph, each of them A bunch of faces craning out, all eyes, To see the victor pass—the man of men— The marvel of the minute. Then night dips The scene in greyness: home the pageant hies: The faded daylight thickens into rain. The wind goes down the empty street and leaves A few great drops in going: the last boys Pull collars up at ears and skelter home. Some folks at windows hitch their carpets in, And rip their pasteboard allegories down; Unfasten limp festoons, roll up long flags, Shake out from balconies the dregs of bloom In the genista wickers; yawning, chain The doors and close the shutters; and so dies My day of glory. For the bravest show Ends, as the dullest of thy days of life, In sleep and supper. Enter Raban. RABAN Is my Conrad here? The King is gone? CONRAD Raban, I am alone Communing with my anger. RABAN Then indeed Your company is bad. I thought as much; Your eyes caught on my face so lofty-earnest As I came in. CONRAD How goes the court? RABAN Why, well; In a calm mood of sleepy shepherd lads Piping among the alders to a lamb; About some honour-nymph, who kissed them once And will not kiss again. 'Tis very pretty! And you? CONRAD I fare as one whose wounded feet Rest in a viper's nest, whose clotted curls Are crawled about with scorpions. RABAN Here's a contrast! Are you in earnest?—Let me search your face: O captain of the thunder-cloud, what cheer, What outlook on the breakers of the world, Can steep your visage in such folds of night That I forget my friend? CONRAD Is this an hour To simper and look sweet, to duck and cringe? When here he stood—the echo of his feet Scarce faded as you entered—here he spake Tricked out in kingly robes a seeming king, And for a season kingly in his phrase, Till, roughened by a stormy petulance, His soul began a rocking like the sea's, And foamy speeches gathered on his lips, And all his mien changed to a parish fool's, Whose vacant forehead wears instead of gold The madman's grasses. RABAN Rain, my masters, rain: These clouds rove out of such a weeping west, I cannot keep the sky-roof's hoarded tears From wetting nature, if this growling god Push his ripe drift about in this fierce way; The air will drench with deluge, as if ocean Fell through its flooring into Satan's house And slaked his half-baked inmates. CONRAD Leave your gibes, And listen: Sigismund, our argument— This ancient sleeper, like a white-faced owl, Drops off to dose at daybreak, snores at noon, And blinks at sunset with half-open eyes; But, if a searching glory of brave deeds Flare, like a fervid sunflake out of heaven, Across his nest and somnolent repose,— Hooting, he raises out white flapping arms, And with a scream is gone. RABAN So let him go, Man, and be merry; you are green at court To turn your mouth down for a few hard names. CONRAD Bitter his face should be whose soul has found Gall of reproof and wormwood of disdain; Who came from doing well for his reward, And found a phantom thing cursing his deeds And mumbling maledictions. RABAN Did he so? Then we must fawn and nurse right humble eyes, And, when his goad bites, scrape and bow our best And look quite cheerful. That's the road to fame. Cringe to this idol—to this puppet kneel— King he must be, though stuffed inside with straw, God he must be, though all his blood is bran. If not within he is just outside heaven— I heard a friar preach so some days since, Who taught the gaping hen-wives all a-row How God and King were cousins: think of that! CONRAD I have no heart for laughter, Raban, none: I am faint with hatred; earth is sick and leer Of all delightful aspects. I discern Only a lame, pale sun grating along Above me in an awful mirk of clouds. The grassy valleys of the landscape seem Red with the knots of interlacing worms, Plum-coloured coils with yellow humpy bands; The garden leaves are drilled away to ribs By the palmer and the locust. There were meadows, But they seem poisoned as with furnace scum. Here went a grass-green mountain rivulet, And now the filthy mother of the stye Would hardly snuff at those polluted waves, Where the green ribbon crusts the stinking ooze. O Raban, wash my fancy, cleanse mine eyes: Extinguish from mine ears this terrible Hiss of a giant furnace: my mouth sweeten Raw with a sick salt taste like mine own blood Welling away, which leaves me faint and fainter. And all my being like a limp dry leaf, Seeks something sweeter than the rainy spring To perished grasses. O my sickness needs One anodyne—Hush! vengeance. Did you hear Vengeance, my comrade? Fancy, how the flower Drains fever-lipped the ardent drench of God, When the cloud cracks at last, so will I slake To the red dregs the hatred of my soul. RABAN You ended in a whisper. CONRAD I was wise. RABAN O wise enough, since any curtain here May harbour in its fold a palace cat. And we have many: well they watch—for birds. CONRAD You heard my almost silence? RABAN The word's flash More than its sound I caught. Methought, I heard A knife drawn cleanly through a mellow pear, And so I guessed your drift. CONRAD A brave word, clear, And keen, and ringing as a glove of steel Flung down against the flags. We muffle it Just now and thrust it back into our pouch Quietly, lest it tinkle; but some day Down it shall sing, a knell to him who hears. RABAN Said like a soldier, purposed like a king. (Half aside) Did he but know what royal makings lay Within him he might rise. He has the stuff And fibre of a king; did he but know— Did he but know! CONRAD (appearing not to hear him) Well! What sour mutter'd purpose Curdles your lips? Speak out: wilt dip an oar Behind my rowlock in these rolling vales Of a huge, hoarse, unnavigable sea? 'Tis a black broth to launch our shallop in. Dare you push out among this seething scum, Where the flake whitens up against the wind, And sighs in wild crests at a few great stars? RABAN My fortunes and thy danger have one helm. CONRAD Then watch my anger's signal to spread sail: Watch! Need I roll my further purpose out? RABAN My soul is as a mirror to my friend, Reflecting clear the double of his will. CONRAD The strong hand to the subtle brain says—done. He who can comrade these may quell the earth. According to our gift we parcel out Our functions in this peril—you agree? RABAN Perfectly; yes. I penman, drudge of peace, Unwarlike chattel, lump of twisted limbs, Weak as a mouse, reared on a king's sour crumbs, Bring the great lion of the forest heart, And whisper, ‘I am with him.’ He can rend And I can nibble. CONRAD Ay, the file is good, When the axe falters blunted. RABAN Thou shalt win, My champion; lo, my prophet wishes tinge Thine onward path with tingling glories. Leave The unwarlike dregs to me of thy great task; Leave me the mean, have thou the valorous half Of this our enterprise. If aid I can By spurting innocent ink, this court shall roll In sepia clouds fuliginous; within Whose canopy, do thou thy will, feel out Wide, ambient arms, soft sinuous rings as iron; My Briareus of the sea, touch, tighten, fold Terribly round thy victim; crush and strain, Till thou reject again into stained waves A pale mass, done with, blurred, a formless pulp, A skin, a bloodless shadow, to be rolled By random waters on to casual shores, Rocked by the aimless and irreverent tides; The rollers' plaything and the breakers' pastime, Till the last sinew rot! CONRAD Thine emphasis Comes like the sudden sea-rush, warm and wild, Salt, windy, bitter-sweet, and full of sun, And sings like the storm water on the beach, Whose petrel at mine ear trills—‘Vengeance!’ RABAN Right! O sweet bird, Vengeance! dove of tender plume; Step gently: she is timid, and sings least At moulting time, red are her wing-feathers, Else is she dusky as a nightingale, Yet stays a household robin all the year, By the window twigs at watch. If anyone Could whistle her to glide down quietly And peck her meal off even from his palm, I think that one were Conrad. CONRAD And his sword Is not a reed, my friend; and wears a hand Not easily unlocked, when round the hilt Are riveted red fingers, that slip least Because they are red. The moister hand-grip holds. RABAN There sang a vulture floating o'er the slain. Why, man, learn milder music. Here at court The fashion is to lisp out silken lines, And tinker sighing ballads to a rose. Suppose some pretty wench of honour heard This gruff broad-chested fury. Here all spring We sit on velvet, simper, and tease lutes, Pretend we are in love, say ‘well-a-day,’ And stretch our limbs and gape. O blare not in, With noises of the camp and kettledrums, Hoarse as the wind and stained with battle-drops. You will flutter all our rose-girls and their fools Who play at kissing blindfold. CONRAD O most right! A secret, by the stars, a secret, Raban— All, to the King himself, play hoodman here, And he plays best. For dotage oft resumes Its childish pranks; so up he binds his brows, And feels his way and knocks his eyeless head On post and column, and the courtiers fawn— Did ever King dispense so well with sight, Was ever Lord so clever without eyes? So witless stumbles he o'er resting lions, And hair-brained kicks dog-dragons in their gills, And sets his shoe on some doe-hydra's tail. So, darkened, he doth curse at those who see, And fallen he will rail at those who stand, Until a dark hand sudden in his hair Tears off the bandage and he sees—a grave. RABAN The voice of one that crieth in the waste, I too will rail at princes: how they doze, How some are half and others quite asleep, All carry golden rings above their ears; And one has crept up to the brink of time, As a lean caterpillar nosing space On the leaf's utmost tip. Suppose he fell Plumb down the gulf. I wonder, who would weep? Would one dog leave his bone, one child stop play In the gutter, one clown in his alehouse sigh? So men lament their gods who have attained Their final consecration. CONRAD Let it come Swiftly: let this grey creature soon resume His more appropriate element of earth. It may be kind to put this moldwarp down Where he can scoop himself a sleepy ledge. RABAN Now or next year? CONRAD The famine of my hate Watches the leaden hours and will not feed. RABAN Faith! Is it come to hours? Then wary men Had better carry cloaks or bide indoors: An evil night begins for hoodless brows. There is a singing in the air of rain. And the dogs creep away beneath the chairs Snuffing the thunder ere it sound. I think, God thunders better than our toothless King: Who minds this mumbler, who? CONRAD His injuries Are mightier than himself. This crumbling ruin, Roofless with broken sides and bulging bricks, Is overgrown with deadly weed, and green With ramping stems whose fat and acrid gum Is in the taster's mouth hot death and fire. And at their root the adder litters young, The warty toad limps; for his wintry sleep The newt craves harbour. So this king ere death Seems to be storehouse and supreme resort Of all corrosive thoughts and wrathful whims; And these things make the old man terrible, And terrible he is. O Raban, Raban, There he stood blinking, there he spake and quavered, The meanest living man I think on ground— O, but he gave me foul reproof, my Raban, Being most helpless; it was hard to bear From one so feeble yet so venomous, Worse in a hundred ways. Had twenty men Young, strong, and noble hounded me with lies, I had borne it with a less tumultuous ire. RABAN What said he then? CONRAD All things which wound and grieve, All shameful things, wild lies, and furious words, From a full urn and cask of bitter sides He shed out bravely. RABAN Let a bed of worms Silence his violent lips; let grass and gravel Choak up his eyes for this; most shallow fool, To curse his great sweet sun with saviour beams And call the night in on his naked side: Let him feel after darkness with his hands, And draw a shroud of shards across his feet, Immeasurable dotard? CONRAD Hear me, friend; I asked, and I was worthy, and he sneered. Raging he would have pelted me away Out of his hall with words like any dog. RABAN How grew this husk of discord, on what kernel? CONRAD You mock me, for you know. RABAN I have cracked many A nut of human sorrow, and have found The same white maggot there. CONRAD You mock me more. RABAN I have seen armies meet in thunder-clouds, And such thick darkness masked their congress, none Knew why they strove. Then to my soul I said, We will see why: so, wading through the fume, We sought into the midmost vapour, passed Through each successive envelope of darkness, Till at the very core of tumult, lo! We came upon a pretty rose-red thing, Weeping her amethyst eyes out, innocent: O, she knew nothing how the turmoil grew! CONRAD Scorn me not, Raban, in my hour of tears;— I loved her very much and told him so, I made my suit right humbly at his knee; His kingdom and his capital he owed me, The very roof over his head he owed me, And I forbore to tell him— RABAN How ere this He might have had for palace some damp rock, A brace of ravens as his seneschals, Square bats for courtiers, who should squeak to him How great he was, king of wild glen and grass, With daffodils for honour-maids, a lily Instead of our adorable, his daughter! CONRAD Were there no lilies in his realm but one? One I demanded: I had saved them all Growing demure in many a forest field, Trembling divine, in orchard avenues Of his great land, on many a woodland floor Nurtured in honour, damsels among flowers, Pale, moist mid shining dew, and folded round With wide hoods sheathing them to the white chins up, Shrinking and holy. God himself had wept, If some rank fox had come with bestial snout, And laid them bare and broken and defiled. RABAN Is this about a lily or a maid? CONRAD Either, or both, or neither at thy will! Wilt hear another image? RABAN Faith, I must: 'Tis penalty for knowing one in love. CONRAD The birds of blood came round my little lamb, As she lay sleeping in her fold. I heard The beating of their feathers in the storm, The grinding of their wings against the hail; I rose and smote the swooping harpies dead, Dead with their talons fastening on their prey; And the old heavy shepherd woke at last, And cursed me for my deed, and laid his staff About my shoulders. RABAN Allegory still! In fine, to strip all feathers off your phrase, You want a wife. Our father Sigismund Hath such a wifely daughter, good at need, And clear as custard. Having done this king Brave service, you demand her, he denies, Adds evil names, and so the quarrel hangs. CONRAD You take my heart like an anatomist And carve it into pieces. Frigidly You reason on its fibres. O my friend, Have you no fairer comfort? RABAN By the mass, I'd rather wish you joy than wrinkle brows Into condolement here. Go to: there is much In such a loss to mitigate despair. It may be, that, denying you a bride, The gods are wholly gracious after all. CONRAD You are merry. RABAN And with reason I rejoice, Who never came off lighter by one tear In Cupid's service. Who would play as soon With a rope-end as a girl's finger tips; Who keeps his lips for wine and flesh of beeves, And never cared how kisses tasted yet— I Raban, hunched and bunched, the crippled scribe, A wart of nature, not a natural man, Thwart spine and twisted limbs and bulging brows— Viler than offal of her sacrifice To lady Venus, eyesore to the herd Of smirking maidens round the queen of fools, The mother of sweet lies and cankered roses. O Aphroditè, in thy prurient fanes, By thy tainted reek, the whispers, and the worms, By the dim candles, and the draggled robes, Thy shameful altars and polluted floors— I cannot find thee god. I rather find thee A leper queen, whose bright unwholesome breast, Sweet at a distance only, is marvellous With the whiteness of her curse; and in whose limbs The poisoned fire of many shameful days Eats on for ever. Horrible thou art; And loathsome as the twelve-month buried dead Are these thy worshippers, love's veterans, Who come with the flat skull-like face of lust To clasp thy knees, vast harlot, spurious queen! Lo! I abhor thee, I whom God has made Ridiculous, for any wayside fool To grin and gape upon, a limping toad Among the lithe and beautiful young men; How the clear brain perfectly formed, intense, Pines in the bestial vesture of such flesh As my untended mother in her throes Pushed me into the light with. O good brain, Be to me for strong hands and graceful feet, Be thou instead of speed and supple sinews; Though locked to lie obscured in such a husk, Yet art thou fair in thy omnipotence, Despised, deformed, rejected. Thou art I, Not these enfoldings, which are only meant To do thy pastime, Love. These crutch-like limbs Will do to move my brain on: more I need not; And as for Love, I will write upon his altar, ‘Let Love be cursed in the lowest!’ CONRAD Friend, my friend, I'd rather bite a finger off my hand, Than jeer at thee, in whom Dame Nature wrought So well within, that careless of the crust, She leaves that rough and wrinkled. Staunch ally, Would I exchange thee for a regiment Of idiots faced as Phœbus, limbed as Mars? Mere Force doth idly beat the unwounded air, But at his elbow Craft sees where and when, And, nodding, with her furtive index shows The rift-place in the armour. I thank God, We are together in this matter, friend; For I should blench, nay by the mass, I should Though retinued with armies, if I saw Thy small unwarlike knuckles wield their pen Against my train approaching. RABAN We are one, One sword of purpose in the hand of doom, I am the hilt and you the blade. My brother, How can we break asunder? In your wrong I see a brother scorned: at your rebuke I feel myself degraded; at your lash I wince, in your disgrace I hide my head. O see, the long day of our patience flags In tired sunset. See, all hands are limp, All hearts are weary. On his palace wall Discord hath ripened as an apple long. The time is heavy with this dotard's reign; And we must mend it, leaving truce to fools And compromise to caitiffs; not as boys Tilting a tyrant down with windle-straws, Or breaking idle reeds against his coat; No, but as soldiers, driving arrows home Up to the feather in his iron heart. We have endured this palsy for a king Through many watches of obedience, now Thy star arises, Conrad, and its name To him is wormwood. One, who saw him, told me That, as thy triumph clashed in music past, He never went to the window; each acclaim That pierced his deafness, huddled at the fire, Stung him like eager pain. Each ringing cheer Lengthened his parchment face in envious seams. Be not amazed, if after such repast On a young rival's praises, when you met He gave you peevish curses. Kings regard Their kingdoms as their wives, in whose meek mouths A husband's commendation may be heard, But no man's else. Look up, my prince of spears; What remedy in hanging down the head, What help in sighing is there? He may die To-morrow, or the next day, or the next! CONRAD I think his tedious briefness will wear out Some wagon-load of moons. His saying good-bye Will last a cycle. Till I see the mould Stamped down upon the box of his last rest, I shall believe him here. The spice of power Keeps him from rotting; till the latest last Will this bald bully clutch his bauble rule, And prove himself alive by teasing us, Until the coffin plate is on his heart. Death has forgotten him. He will not die. The spectral hunter on his hackney Time, Whose game-bag is the grave, has seen him often, And finds him as familiar to the sight As those grey dogs, disease and war, who follow And lick the phantom's heels. As soon would he Draw arrow upon Sigismund as these. RABAN For Death and he have lived in one small house So long together, that, as cat and dog Both in one narrow cottage born and fed, They lick each other lovingly, and share The hearth in perfect friendship. CONRAD You are right; Death in his memory does not bear the name Of Sigismund. RABAN Then Death must be reminded; And we might gently nudge his shadowy wrist, And point the way where this old creature sits, Playing with straws and mowing at the moon, An insult to the purple and the light. CONRAD Meaning—O friend, my very anger pales, When in thy words I see my thought take form, Vestured as one at midnight, who returns With red hands and wild eyes and silent feet Out of a sleeping chamber: as he glides, He leaves a track behind him, like a man Who has bathed; the lamps are low, but in the morn Will these be drops of water? RABAN Is my captain Become a girl? Then, Sigismund, retain Thy throne, for they, who questioned on thy claim, Are turned such babies, that they fear to enter The dark room of rebellion; quickly quell them. CONRAD I am no weakling, yet my nature quails; As at the portal of some hideous cave We take slow farewell of the upper air, Creep in, and feel on downwards to our deed. As we descend the wide and awful deeps Grow palpable beneath us; dimly unrolled Are giant rocks and a vast midnight sea, Whose lengths of spume are rocking terribly Against the brinks of blue-black terraced cliffs; And in their nooks and ledges, sheer in air, Are built huge kilns, which redden and grow pale Alternately, making their flame beat time To the pulse of the waters under them; as if Within the cliff walls unseen channels fused Water with fire, and wave with lambent flame. So to the mountain furnaces that sea Rocks up in time its dreadful tidal wave And roars and draws and soughs—(a pause)—horrible vision! RABAN The nightmare of a day-dream, bred on thoughts Which are distempered; air, and smoke, and megrims Of no validity to scare a sparrow. These visions are as vapour in the eye; Whistle them off. If dreams can blanch thy brow, 'Tis time to sheathe the sword and take the distaff. CONRAD Raban, I may be rebel but no butcher. Pure is my palm, my thought alone is red. Let him alone: Death's hand is on his heart. A worm and moribund, shall I feel rage At such a creature? Let him crawl away Into a crack of earth. RABAN A pretty change! We leap into smooth weather; Boreas Transformed to smirking silvery Zephyrus In the moulding of a moment, at one clap; O, let the birds upon the vanes beware, And shift their iron tails in season round. CONRAD I will not turn assassin at thy sneer For a few weeks of patience; I am human And in my anger placable—But thou— RABAN Let me conclude—am something in my spirit Not humbler than a worm, not wholly cowed; Something which carries purpose in its teeth To close upon and rend the insolent heel That spurns it in the face. CONRAD Thou hast no Love: He is at least her father. RABAN A most fair Remorseful afterthought. Our talk began, Whether to use a pillow or a poniard. We questioned on the fashion of his exit; That we must dress him somehow for his grave, Methought, was most abundantly conceded, Ere we began to clatter teeth and tongue On this conspiracy. Now through my Lion Peeps out the lover Lamb! You are but dough Moulded by this girl's knuckles any way! CONRAD My mood is ended: I am patient now. RABAN This patience is an estimable mule; Load her as Atlas she will not repine. The lash by day is music in her ears, A bag of rye at nightfall her reward. Her livelong toil brings money to his pouch, Who scores his thanks in wheals upon her hide; And, when her joints are stiff and eyes are scaled, She rests among the thistles, and attains That paradise of donkeys, pasture grass. CONRAD Goad me not, Raban— RABAN Nay, there is no need. Thou hast a neck that draws the collar well. CONRAD Be mute! RABAN As thou art patient. CONRAD I have seen The red drops gather on my naked sword, As the fight clashed and lightened at my side: I heeded them no more than dew or rain. But here at home, in the awful hush of peace— An old grey bloodless man— RABAN Must die at once, Who, left alone, would die some early day In a most brief hereafter. Is that stuff To wet an eye-lash on, or stint a smile? Weep not, my friend, the tyrant; but bewail His tyrannies. They are the enduring part Of this old snake soon to be charmed asleep, Soon to be shaken into recordless Dust and oblivion. Then, you want this girl, Or fancy that you want her, which is one;— I cannot find much wisdom in her need; But let that pass;—If I were in your clothes, Pining for such a smooth white piece of plague, Which some old peevish fool in spite withheld, Feebly audacious, shouting to prevent The pathway of the lion to his mate,— When one most gentle push would clear the pass, And let me through the gate to fairy-land, Where my most silver maiden sits and weeps,— Think you, that I,—the hunchback, half a man, Most unheroic, whose lame feet have craft To avoid the nets of passion plainly spread, Which mow the swift ones down and tear their wings,— Think you, that I would pocket up such wrong? Nay, I would have at grey-beard in the pass, And either roll him flatling to the ditch, Or crush him on the flints that fringe the wall, Leaving compassion to more martial souls. CONRAD I will consider. RABAN Meaning you relent. CONRAD It shall be, as he uses me to-night At the great banquet. If I there be shamed Among my soldiers, ere this moon shall wane, Strange sound shall come at midnight in these doors, Fear and a cry. Then moaning shall arise A weeping phantom in a yellow crown, Leaving its royal couch for larger rest; And, where it lay, shall trembling hands disclose A heap of limp robes and white ruined limbs. SCENE III. Adelheid's Chamber in the Palace. Adelheid and Letalda. ADELHEID Whose days are best, mine or a peasant maid's, Born on an alp, who shepherds some few ewes, And from the mountain valleys brings them in When the star rises. Happy heart she bears To see them in their dewy cabins warm, Happy to waken ere the swallow does, And lead them out again where grass is crisp, And rivulets, with music like their bells, Trickle through little orchards of the wild Blue bilberry. My alpine shepherdess, The wolf and eagle are your only cares; Mine are not bred in woods or eyrie rocks, But in such bitter multitudes they come, That I would change into thy humble sphere, And loan thee all my splendour. LETALDA You would tire Of sheep-cotes, sweet, in one long summer morning Their rough farm service sounds much better feigned, And lightly fingered o'er in madrigals, Than crushed between the honest palms of truth. No lover—though his locks were burnished hoarfrost, His lips the tender rose-pale willow-weed, His cheek outgraining the best cheek on all The sunny side of the orchard,—though his breath Were calamus, his sighing air of India,— Not the best boy compact of shining clay Should by defection send me tenting goats, Or watching swine at run, or bulls at stall. ADELHEID You jest to drive this lapwing of my woe From wailing o'er the fallow of its nest. LETALDA Nay, but no care on earth could make me change A palace for a cow-shed. ADELHEID Any beggar Might crave of me the outward husk, and form, The stately shell, which wraps my weary days, And have them all for asking. LETALDA Runs thy wave Up to this inch of sorrow? ADELHEID Ay, my sweet, Beyond the sea-wall's nicks of ancient seas, And all the strand-lines of forgotten floods, And up, my girl, and over them this tide Swims greenly by a fathom, and leaps on To higher desolation. LETALDA It will turn And only tinge thine instep and thy skirt With woolly wash of foam-drift. ADELHEID I would rather Pass from my nature—be an eft, an emmet, A fallow mole, a fountain centipede, Than chidden as I am. A chidden princess! There is no natural marriage in these words, That jar united. Let them save their chiding For boys and girls at school. I think, Letalda, That I am natured proud and resolute, That I would drive a dagger in my side As lief as suffer slighting. I speak strangely For one, whose cloistered girlhood has but seen Men pass in books and quarrel on white pages; Yet, as I read, behind my lattice roses, On worm-drilled vellum of old-world revenges, Done, when a man was nearly dead of shame, For some vast wrong endured—Ah, then, Letalda, I heard an echo-pulse cry at my heart, ‘I should have wrought as they did!’ (A pause.) Hast thou heard How fares the King this dawn? LETALDA He sits, as ever, And chews upon the bitter drug of anger; His worn grey face gleams with a savage leer; He furnaces fresh fuel ever on His glowing piled displeasure. Wait, my princess, And let him burn away. The Queen is with us, She chides in semblance only, dotes on Conrad, And feigns half-hearted wrath: she is bound to echo Thy father to appease him by degrees. She labours on thy side with all her soul, And bends in policy before the storm-blast. To champion thee or Conrad at this nick Would be to drive a taper in dry hay, Or drop a match on brimstone! ADELHEID Woe the while To this poor desolation of myself, This bundle of despair called Adelheid— Whose mother only looks at her and weeps, Whose father wounds her with a cold regard, Or sits with gathered mantle at his eyes Nursing a stormy silence. Daylight turns, And the leaves beat the window; there they sit On in the gloaming like two tongueless ghosts, Or as the marble guardians of a gate At stony watch. Untasted at his hand The wine-cup bubbles. His old hunting dog, Reading the tumult of his master's brow, Forbears to crave his meal. I dare not say— ‘My father, am I dead that you forget To love me? Then the dead should be forgiven. But, since I live and you pronounce me faultful, I bring you tears and sorrow. I could bring No more to God himself—so pardon me.’ LETALDA Thy handmaid yields no succour and no gift; And only says she is sorry with thy sorrow. ADELHEID Come, tell me this—are other damsels doomed To love and see love wither, to admire And find their glory flung a broken heap Under the wheels of time? In my good day I did exalt one lover over all men; I pinnacled his image half-way heaven, And swung from foolish censers many sighs Up to him every morn. He is fallen now, And dusty degradation stains his face. Why is he fallen? Answer, bitter heart: Because thy glance came softly where he stood, And brake him from his pedestal. Ay, surely I have an evil eye, and could blast kine, Give rosy children chin-cough, welter sheep; Let all nail up a horse-shoe where I love, And grow St. John's wort—I am dangerous. If I be deadly when my favour falls, Lord of my youth, forget me, and farewell Last of my lovers. In my father's land Are many graves; among them dig me one: There must be room for one more sleepy face. LETALDA Thy syllables are bitter as the wail Of a girl over her first child born dead. Lady, arise, have comfort, sleep or sing; Unclasp this girdle of anguish, give thy heart Freedom to beat. Thy rose lips were not born Yet to say sorrow; neither were such eyes Made to bear only rounded fruit of tears. ADELHEID I have wedded Desolation with a ring; A graven posy runs inside of it— ‘Tears beget patience.’ Many wives wear such, And cannot make the inward letters out. We can pray also; add this to the scroll, Then will it run—patience and tears and prayer; Woman's epitome; three reasons why We come into this painted field of earth. LETALDA A watcher for a step that will not come; A weeper near a face that cannot smile; A worshipper of saints who never hear;— These are the only parts we girls are given To play in an old time-worn tragedy Called ‘Love belated in a world of sighs.’ ADELHEID I never thought so until yesterday, When suddenly God's hand came out of heaven, And withered up my paradise of dreams, And drave me from the garden where I lived With my girl's heart right merry. I arose Exiled, and, going, heard a foul wind smite The corners of the temple of my past, The dear old easy past; and lo, behold, Ashes and fallen roof and burning beams. LETALDA We did not augur sorrow, when we watched The troopers in from Arnheim; whom among Thy soldier came, chief rose in Honour's crown. ADELHEID Nay, sweet, that morn my heart was bathed in heaven, As the bells clashed, and they came spurring past; And he, the noblest, in his burning mail Rode grandly through the square with thoughtful eyes; And none so poor a maiden in the street But crushed and pushed to get her glance at him. Then in his might and glory I was glad; And in the sombre background of my soul Bright thoughts began to rise, each after each In a fair order, shedding gold; as when The clear and calm procession of the stars Is lifted up in ether, one by one, And the brown twilight sorrowful recedes, And all the coppice and dun under-shrubs Begin to glitter as with showery rain; Though dryer than a road the nightly land. LETALDA The voices of the people praising him Rose as a furnace full of withered boughs. ADELHEID I leant among the swallows at my casement, And watched my lover's triumph wind below; And the pied martins fluttered round my head, And dipped into the street and back again To sun their panting bosoms on the tiles, And bided there a little, then cried out And tossed themselves out swiftly on the air Down and away; then raced their children back Into the necks of their grey wasplike homes, Niched just above my window. Presently There rose an urgent longing in my soul, That one of these that flitted in the void Midway between the martial pomp below And my face wistful, watching overhead, Would carry down a wreath for Conrad's brow And lay it on his passing helm for me, Who could not reach to crown him with my hand, And had not dared to wreathe him if I could. LETALDA Pity, thou hadst no carrier dove to send him A twig of olive down; he gave us peace; Ere the great wave had licked us from the earth And made our kingdom foam, he turned the sea. ADELHEID Lo, at my window, there I had a dream, Searching the lands of sleep with open eyes, That he would halt at our great door, and call With prelude of a trumpet, ‘I return To claim, O King, my chosen and thy child.’ And from our palace should a clarion peal In answer, ‘It is well: thy chosen comes.’ Then should they lead me vestured as a bride, And the old king should follow laying hands Of blessing on us both; whence rising we Should ride away into the morning land, Turning us, ever and anon, to see The old home vapour-melted far behind And its grey towers a streak upon the verge. LETALDA Did thy dream pass at this, or lengthen on? ADELHEID Yea, the trance held; and onward I discerned The married years, as strips of calm rosed cloud Laid one behind the other in the lake, And olive-golden concave of the dawn— Where, linked with him, my nature might achieve With his achievement, weak no more: no girl Mewed in a silken chamber from the air And the great living wind of human deed; But out with him among the whirling leaves Of mortal wishes, letting all the rain Of the world's weeping sweep against my face: Womanly still, yet in his service iron: Watching my hero's eye, waiting his lip; I might transmute my soul by love unslumbering, And colour all my nature to his tone; My neutral self, my ragged lines cut clean And finished after him; till I emerged The copy of his greatness, made indeed At a great distance, vague and blurred in parts, Yet like enough for men to know us one. Did I dream well? LETALDA God's dew was on thy dream, A devil's hoar-frost on thy waking up. The rich dream leaves us in a naked world With idle empty hands. ADELHEID Then let us sew To cure sore eyes: our tapestry was traced In a design of leaning rose-heads bunched With orange globes of myrtle; pansies rubbed In wreaths against the blue-black cheeks of grapes; And strawberries wild, which underpeeped blue arches Of curly hyacinth. We'll change all that. Sad sewers make sad samplers. We'll be sorry Down to our finger-ends, and broider emblems Native to desolation—cypress sprays, Yew tufts, and hectic leaves of various autumn, And bitter tawny rue and bent black thorns. LETALDA And we can feed our birds, peruse our Hours, And count the flies in the window; we can fold Our hands and then unfold them; we can listen To all the tunes in the wind, to the street foot-falls, Where children patter past lighter than leaves, And old men grind along as heavy wains— ADELHEID And think he may be passing, but my heart Is slow to hear her music so removed. He may be glancing up, but these grey walls Shed barrier black; and so the little loves, Which glide along our eye-rays, meet obstruction, And cannot reach each other fondling hands. LETALDA Thy Life is like a phantom with a torch Groping her way in chambers underground To find white ashes, dust in broken urns. ADELHEID Lo, this my Life was light and crowned and sweet, But she shall sicken and doff her festal robe, And wrap around her shining sides instead The sackcloth cincture of a leper's limbs; About her face shall go a dead man's cowl; And hooded so,—as one, who crawls away, Lest he infect his dearest, wife and child, Having beheld the plague-spot on his flesh, And prays to die unfound, apart from all— So shall my Life creep to some charnel-porch, And grovel in the bitter grass of graves, And rest her live cheek on a lettered tomb, And prone reach out her palms beyond her head, And so lie steeped in that strange light, which flares Out of a sun low-swimming, moribund, Just ere the fingers of an ink-black cloud Creep out, and, crawling upwards, grip at him, And drown him downwards in the dark gulf dead. LETALDA These pictures are the pencillings of woe, Weird as the fragments of a broken night Reeling around the moon. Draw down the blind And come away, refuse to see them; sleep Or pray, until thy sun re-enter heaven With a beam milder. ADELHEID Girl, I charge thee, peace! My road is chosen: I must tread thereby In anguish. This inexorable eld, My deathsman, and my father, and my king, Seeing me hunger for the bread of love Gave me the flint rejection. These old men Sit in frost-bitten shadows; Love, the lark, Sails up above their haze, and finds the sun, And flutters warm in gold; but they crouch low With rime around their shoulders and their knees. LETALDA He heard not Pity, Peril he shall hear, And so be reconciled with Conrad; one Is weak at lips, the other is a roar To turn the laden eagle, halfway home, Back in his heaven, though hungry in their nest He hears afar the shrieking of his young.— The land is dangerous: O royal maid, The large affliction of thine innocent eyes Hath made me, daughter of the people, turn A traitor to the people, and divulge Their simmering wrath, their opportunities, Their drawing back to spring. My kith and kin Would burn my blabbing lips off, if they heard me; But weak compassion with strong cords has haled The secret from my most unwilling heart. Approach thy sire; O seek him, sweet, at once, And bid him lean his ear along the ground, And listen—By the Lord, he will do well To listen; for Rebellion at his doors Raises so deep a clarion brazen-bound, Leans back to blow and purses shaggy lips And fills the apples of his cheeks with storm;— The terror of whose trumpet is a blast Full of black wind, hail cloud, and thunder fire, Rending the wide-branched cedar, plucking forth The oak-king like a daisy from the sward. ADELHEID Thy words sweep out over my head as rain. How shall this be? Rebellion! I see none: Listen, around this palace, as of old, The pace of guardian sentinels goes on: Yonder the Host sways past to some sick man: The market fills with ruby-kirtled wives: The burghers bring their tables out-of-doors And in long glasses chink a health to Peace. LETALDA These minnows haunt dead-waters of the stream And guess not how the central current swirls. In their small pools the wave is crystal clear, But yellow flood boils yonder, full of roots, Foam, and the scum of unwashed city sides. ADELHEID Let it roll on. The throne is guarded well. LETALDA How guarded? ADELHEID Why, with hearts of gold, true spears, Who tossed the foeman, like a truss of hay, Out of the walls at Arnheim. LETALDA Soldiers, lady, Are mutable as children; if you wrench The instant's plaything rudely from their hand, They hit at one they kissed a moment gone. Our troops are mutinous: the cause is plain. The king strikes out at Conrad; and, behold, In angry pain his entire army thrills Writhing, and in a shudder of cold sweat With clenched lips tingles. Say you, ‘Can this be?’ I say, 'twere stranger false and likelier true; For Conrad is our soldiers' oracle, Their idol, pattern, conscience; round his brow The rays of these four various reverences Converge into a nimbus. Woe the day, When thy blind father fell at odds with him. Were all his councillors as blind as he? Did all our watchmen sleep? Ye ancient wisdoms, Who stand about the throne, and move your faces To search the four wide quarters overhead Of star and cloud, ye surely slumbered then, Or blind corrosion of some dusty dream Held you in thrall though wakened, and made trees Men and men bushes. Otherwise, I know, Ye ne'er had held such sad-eyed silence, when The wrathful monarch rose with axe in hand To knock the main-prop of his palace out, And leave the fabric rocking in the gale To stand or tumble in as luck decreed. Then at the feast— ADELHEID This morn one of my girls Spake of new quarrels at the banquet risen; But, being sad enough, I asked no more Knowing her news was bad, and all my help Was sitting still. LETALDA Right, O my princess, right: And silence as a chain shall bind my lips. A bad and bitter banquet! Ask no more. ADELHEID Nay, thou shalt speak; there are two agonies, The pain of guessing and the pain to hear: The last is lightest. Speak. LETALDA I loathe the task.— The tables in that high ancestral hall Were triple, furnished bravely for the feast. One for thy sire with those who, nearest him In lineage, office, or sustained esteem, Might break their crust upon a common board With the right regal master of this harvest Of dainties many-sheaved; men weighed and worthy, As his whole garden-realm's selected buds, To bloom at feast in a king's neighbourhood; All circled round and towards him all converged, Who, as a rubious aster, golden-stamened, Held state in midst, or seemed authentic sun To these, who leant as sunflowers to his beam. So they, our nation's noblest, richly dight In capes of vair, and ermine-lappet robes, Looped russet hoods, or amber-purple sleeves, Shone on each hand of where their monarch blazed Utterly crimson save his tawny tiar. And on this table meat was delicate, And viand dainty. Here a queen might eat With her imperial daughters, and fare well. Here overhead the trophies swept and swung; Here Arnheim's hot and newly-gathered spoils Flapped in two wide crossed banners on the wall With laurel and this motto—‘I have won.’ Below, the myriad lights, the costly cups, Huge silver salvers heaped with perfumed fruit, Tankards of wine, the clank of glittering chains, Soft velvet phrases, jewelled hands reached out— Made such a rich confusion, that a guest, Feasting, might think he dreamt of festivals, And presently would waken in his sheets, And, hungry, eyelids rub. Two lesser tables, By some steps sunk beneath the upper one, Were spread in the remote and outward hall, Nearer the entrance, further from the king; A precinct where white scullions thrust in game At kitchen hatches, or bore seething in Trenchers of flesh, all vapour from the pans. Above these boards the lamps, more rarely swung, And wider intervals of clustered candles Gave out less copious starlight. This had use, For some, who feasted there in demi-shade, Seemed like the sons of spiders in their old And dismal splendour, passed from sire to child, And now unfolded, carious from the chest, To grace this day of pomp, more suited surely To a decent twilight gleam. Such numb extremes Made up the ends and fingers of that feast: Paltry officials, ancients, pages, scribes, Minstrels—ignoble all: hedge-company Caught in to fill the forms and pack the hall, Lest Sigismund should note with eye displeased Blank vacancy, misfeatured to the pride Of monarchs flushed with hospitalities. Into this region, where no honour sat, A pursy usher, strutting down the hall, Beckons me Conrad, signs him into seat Hard by the gusty entrance, out of hail Of all co-equals, neighboured in with boors, Crushed up with burghers in their civic tags, Knights without land, and out-at-elbow squires In rusty doublets. Presently, those near Pledge him in horn: in horn he drinks again, Sighs a great sigh and glances up the hall, Rolling his eyes; yet silent, as a shaft Of basalt poised on some sea-ledge above The clangour of the trivial breakers there; Dark as a cloud, when tempest colours him; So stood he all his height, and seemed one frown Above the ripple of laughter, and the sparkles Of agate and of emerald and of gold; Contemplating the far-off dais, where Some of his peers, and many a lesser man, Drank wine around their king in precious cups; And, in great shame at his right humble seat, He sighed again; and loathingly glanced down Between the brace of round-backed citizens, His neighbours in repast. Then down sat he At last with a most sullen emphasis, And all his armour echoed through the hall; And men said, ‘What is that?’ and ushers stared Prying upon him curiously. Whereat, He called the nearest, saying, ‘Good Sir Spy, Since you were placed to peer how I digest My degradation, and to carry word To the arch-ape, whom you his lesser monkeys Beslaver: I will spare your further watch, And of myself send tidings how I feel. My message, this: omit one word and die.’ So the wretch ran in terror and wide-eyed Between the backs of feasters up the hall; He felt the eye of Conrad on him still, He feared his promised death; that drave him on;— Up to the King he came, then halted dumb, But saw, even there, with a corner of his eye Conrad afar across the feasters wave An angry arm: then, kneeling, dead with fear, He plucked this message forth from quivering lips— ‘Conrad, thy captain, pledges thee, O King, Out of his humble horn. Do thou drink back In a great cup and yellow. Conrad cries,— To-night his wine is sour and bitter-thin; Yet in the morning he will brew a cup For thee and thine red as the rolling ray: The rim thereof is clay-bound as the grave; Its depth two fathoms, and its vintage such, That, if a king once drink between its brims, He thirsts no more: so Conrad bids thee hail.’ And, as he heard the message, Sigismund Flushed, and went pale, and flushed, and plucked his robe, And griped his chair. Then, like one out of breath, Turned to his chancellor, and said, ‘My Lord, I am deafer than my wont in all this noise, And the knave gabbles; heard you what he said? I caught some drunken treason in his tones: Old wine between a fool's unseasoned lips Is parent of much drivel. Slave, begone; Sleep off thy rouse forgiven. I cannot rear A gallows on a night of victory, But 'ware thy next offence: fly, knave.’ He fled: And Conrad saw him leap out like a hare Through the great doors, and, seeing, knit his brows; And to his horn bent down, austere and dumb. ADELHEID The insult at this feast was rashly done. LETALDA The gauntlet of his threat as wildly thrown. ADELHEID Nay, he meant nothing; Conrad will relent. I'll laugh him tame: his anger in my hand Shall turn into a very turtle-dove And coo for pardon. Most I fear my sire, Cold in his crust of age, implacable, With one grey shadow steadfast on his face. O foolish youth, to launch at this white head, Inexorable, thine innocuous fire, Sheeting the verge without a bolt or sound. He is a boy and rash in boyhood's right, And his renown is come before his beard. Yet, O my father, how extenuate Folly in thee? Let boys be granted fools; Still, age should load much wisdom on old men, As oaks catch snows when winter air is still; Yet hath unwisdom rained on thee as meal; For what fool ever made a wedding supper, And benched the bridegroom lowest at the door? For Arnheim's winning you carouse: the man, Who won this red bride with the ring of war, Must feast in some dishonoured corner, held Unworthy to dip finger in thy dish. LETALDA O antic pride! I will go sup with clowns; For shepherds do not wrangle for degrees Around a bowl of milk. ADELHEID In this king's house Let all men eat henceforth their bread alone. For yesterday our guests came in as doves With a soft winnowing sound; and, having fed, They rose and went away as tawny wolves, With awkward slouch and one lip-corner raised. LETALDA Your speech is truer than you understand. ADELHEID Then did the banquet grow to worse? LETALDA It did. Certain there were, who in those golden halls Sate with the chief, on whose most royal souls The degradation of our greatest captain Fell like their own disgrace. But lesser things, There seated, smiled, and rubbed insidious hands, And whispered in keen relish, little worms! But those great goodly hearts of generous strain, Seeing their peer so seated, could not taste That royal wine with any more content, And in their mood, abhorring tables spread With loathsome dainties and insipid cheer, Rose up, one-minded all, and out they went; And clashed in gleaming armour down the hall, And turned their shoulders on the royal face, Which, watching their defection, flared up red; As its lord fiercely to his varlets signed To cram their vacant benches with a drove Of more obsequious revellers. ADELHEID And Conrad? LETALDA Hinge of this discord, hero of this storm, Sate in his humble place and did not go. ADELHEID How looked he then? LETALDA Still as a cat, who sits Watching a crevice, mute, with cruel eyes; Disdaining to abridge his shameful penance By the least sand-grain in the hour-glass neck; Seeming to flaunt his insult, as a flag Unfurled on largely-breathing heaven, which bears Revolt in rolling letters on its face. So he sat on, and gave no man a word In dumb endurance. Then, arose the last Of feasters in the slowly-emptying hall, And, with apparent dilatory musing, Gained in no haste the greatly-sculptured doors, And passed out wrathful to the quiet stars. ADELHEID Did none of all that many seeing him In the deep waters offer out a hand? LETALDA One limped into the darkness after him, And plucked his sleeve and tiptoed at his ear,— A wried thing, bitter-dangerous, and small, That maggot speck, that gnaws its way and feeds On ink and vellum—call him nothing, since His very name is poison in good mouths. ADELHEID Did Raban comfort Conrad? Can my love Give heed to such a worm? It cannot be. The twain are sundered wide as vale of heaven And glen of sulphur-land. O poor love wounded! LETALDA And tempted with a snake. ADELHEID O perilled love, Thou art lonely in thy desolation, none But evil mouths are ready at thy ear. The nets are spread to catch my lion's feet; Spears glimmer in the bushes, hounds cry out And have their muzzles stifled. Frightened birds Spring from the branches; hunters narrow in. But thou art in thy slumber, lion-heart, Seëst and hearest nothing; how the gale Is big with whispers of thy death and doom— O God, Letalda, is there time to save him? SCENE IV. A dark corridor in the Palace. Time, Midnight. Enter Conrad and Raban softly. RABAN Is pity yet our watchword in this realm Sick with the trouble of a dotard's reign? Must we endure? When in our utter patience He finds God's finger signing with approval His eldish pranks and crazed audacities. Last night beneath the stars I found you keen; How fares Revenge, that apple of grim night-shade, Wall-fruit of graves, Death's orchard jenneting,— After one glaring daylight intervened? Has it drawn colour swinging in the sun, And from the soft air sucked maturity, As from a mother's breast? Or is it tumbled A crude green windfall in the careless grass For swine to crunch, and boys to play at ball with? CONRAD That I am here is thy sufficient answer. RABAN Ay, ay, the midnight stars are round again; Morning will soon be written in the silver Rift there outside, beyond that sentry's head— This fellow very wisely guards his king: The foes he fears are mainly from without!— The hour you bade me come burns out in heaven; We meet: the time is apt: the place convenient: The chamber of our quarry well in reach, Yet not too near; say now, what shall be done?— By God, I will not trust those milky brows! CONRAD Raban, my face is very firm for vengeance, Flint-like as yours, inexorably set— In my good time I strike—in my good time. Tease me no more with your perpetual note Of now, now, now. My marsh-frog, croak not death, Death, at my elbow all the winter day. Doth the grey field-kite, poising at its prey, Hasten its swoop or expedite its blow, Because some fussing grasshopper looks up, And wonders why it flutters there so long? The injury is mine beyond dispute, And in my hand alone it rests to choose The season for requital. But you prate, As if we held this pain in partnership; Our tenure is a quaint one, if we do, You take the talking, I endure the sting. RABAN You are in love, my hero—with delay. This girl has caught your dagger-arm between Her rose-leaf fingers, meshed she holds it there. Strike! You are past all striking: bedward wishes Tinkle with more alluring emphasis Than this alarum rocking out your wrongs. CONRAD I tell thee, there is time. RABAN And so there is: Just time enough for hiding those huge limbs, And not a moment more to play with mouths, And toy with fingers. Up, man, hide or run! Creep underneath some cavern-lip of rock, Crouch in the fretted oak, or, safer yet, Souse in some peaty marish to thy ears And shiver sweetly. Out the blood-hounds come. They have given them Arnheim's garland for a scent, And on thy road of triumph laid the trail. Fly! Get thee to the heights! Hale from his den The hill-fox, O most martial, and creep in Instead of him, thy need is more than his; For all the mountain-side is full of horns, And men in green to catch thee! CONRAD By God's fire, If this be jesting, I am sick of such, If earnest, I am ready; let them come. And yet 'tis sudden. Can one old black spider Spin such a coil of mischief in one day? Was nothing purposed when I saw you last? RABAN This stormy bantling is a few hours old. CONRAD Baits this old ferreter some rabbit-gin? RABAN This crazy Jove, to whom we press our hands, And only breathe by license from his eye, Whose name is Sigismund, whose brain is pulp,— Prepares a singing thunderbolt to greet The rival of his glory, well-beloved, The captain, who caught cities while he slept, And sealed his name upon the river-town, For which iniquities this leader dies; Jove take thy bolt up: poise, ignite, and hurl, Heave it out torch-like on the night of heaven, Blue at the head, silver between, and last Orange amid its trailing locks of fire;— O, it will crackle rarely launched in the air; Fate grant, it do not scorch the royal fingers. CONRAD Whether it singe the stars or quench its head In the cold sea, I care not. I am here With folded arms and eyes that quail not. Smite, Smite, if thou dar'st, thou palsy called a king! No mock thou canst devise or I endure Can touch me; insult is my daily meat, And scorn the usual raiment of my limbs. Why am I smitten? Faith, I hardly know. RABAN Then must I teach you: your indictment's this. First, you are young, and, next, you are deserving: Then, have you teased King Frost with rebel Fire, And brandished lust of life before the grave; More, you have spoken well of innocence Before a torpid hornet; last, have praised The use of pinions to a wingless worm. Had any man such catalogue of crimes? O, they learn better, who strike root at court: The King comes first and Nature after him, As is most meet. For Nature at her best Is but a nurse of clowns and reaping hooks, A thing as common as the pasture grass. But if a king feel snowy all year through, Good manners will assent, and kindle fires, When Sirius rages. Perfect breeding learns To shiver while it sweats, if Sigismund Come in with chattering teeth. But you, sir, you, Full of the blowsy summer, bundle in Where winter rules by edict; rush in warm, Turbulent, hopeful, pushing in a swarm Of little naked loves and butterflies; Swearing against all taste and precedent, That it is April and you want a wife. Marry indeed, what have you done? Why this— You have reversed the universal order. For every courtier knows, that, if a king Ordain it shall be cold, why cold it is. CONRAD Goad me no longer, Raban; I have fed So much on fury, that its taste is grown Weary and stale and dull. All doings here, All slights, all strifes of this most petty court Seem like the trivial waves of some far sea Fretting and rising full of noise and foam And hushed to-morrow. RABAN Calm as halcyon waves! The petrels home are gone: dame Ocean sleeps; And in her mood my hero watches Fate, Grandly resigned. He will not wail or wince; Though fragments of a broken universe Clatter around his philosophic brain, This shall not move him in his mighty calm. CONRAD Why this preamble? Are you Æolus, And is this bag, you hitch upon your knee, The cavern of some storm-wind. What comes here? RABAN Read and perpend. I draw my treasure out. Merely a written scroll; peruse it well; For each one word—there are not many—leaves Its parchment, like an arrow with a twang, Sailing to find its target in thy breast And burrow there—My young philosopher, Read all, and, if you can, smile afterwards. CONRAD How came this in your keeping? Why, the words Are Raban's writing. Then my hour is come: I am betrayed; and you, this monarch's spy, Have wormed my secrets out, hired scrivener, To stamp me into prison with your pen! RABAN Philosopher, my young philosopher, What is a prison? Why, a wall and bars; Nothing to one, who reasons, how a wall And bars are matter merely, and must perish In the race and wrack of ages. CONRAD By my life, I will be answered. RABAN By that half-cracked nut-shell— Which steads you for a life to swear upon, Through which the enfranchised kernel called the soul Is all but out—my answer is most simple. By luck, the Rhenish of last night's carouse Flowed to the fingers of the king's own scribe, Making his letters stagger like himself, Instead of marching upright, knee to knee, Stiffened in legal buckram to their chins— And so this sottish penman on his knees Entreats as deputy my sober wrist. CONRAD A miracle of most auspicious chance; As yet this warrant lacks the royal name? RABAN That is soon mended. In his closet yonder Our clement king sits long past bedward hour, Blinking, with pen in fist, and rarely fuming At our delay; in goes the parchment, pat His hand dips, like a swallow, at the ink, Poises, and, rising, sweetly signs his name. Then in one royal flourish turns the key On my spruce Conrad, with good night to him. CONRAD So hoary yet so false! So weak and still So full of venom! Dost thou slink, old fox, To catch an eagle in a woodcock wire? Sleep not just yet or thou mayst never waken. The sands our patience gives thee trickle fast. (A pause) Shall I tear up this rag and sow its shreds Upon wild winds to flutter and adhere In filthy corners of polluted lanes? Or shall I treasure this, and bear it in With crawling gait and mildewed deference, Mock-humble, to his majesty; and speak?— ‘Lord of my long and tedious servitude, Great king and wise one, lo, thy slave is here, Around whose neck the rope at thy command Is fastened: let thy hand adjust its ring. I come into thy presence as one slain, Wearing my grave-clothes; in my hand I bring Thy written passport of my journey home. Sign it, thou knowest best: I kiss the pen. For life and death are feathers in thy hand; And we are grigs that chirp before the light Of thy face shining; dumb when it withdraws. I anger thee, so sign and send me down To tell the phantoms of the red profound, That Sigismund is coming; and I come His herald to prepare his couch below, And warm his slippers.’ RABAN Take the scroll and go; But hide the dagger in between its leaves; Both at his breast-bone offer with a sweep. O, the rare sight—repaying in a moment, God-like, the dragging dastardies of years,— To see the tyrant wince, the dotard howl, And grovel gasping; when thy bright wasp springs Out of its yellow leaves, and stings his heart In through the purple and the jewels, deep And deeper. CONRAD O revenge, sweet falcon bird, Mellow and great, with keen wings like the sun, And fierce deep eyes that search all space for prey; Hold her well in, then loosen; she will soar Straight, and her beak will strike the quarry down, And tear this white and fluttering owl-thing dead. RABAN Art thou resolved? CONRAD O, Raban, I have read Too long the book of patience. I have nursed Pity, because his foolish head was grey, And his false hands were wrinkled. In return He winds his wicked fingers round my throat— For so doth royal gratitude embrace us— And in defence, because the law of God Allows it, I do rip the monster's face, And fling him down, clay in a cloth of gold.—(A pause) Give me the parchment: I am ready, Raban,— Thy hand—I am ready (Goes to the window). Look out there, my friend, See yonder moon swims low, a silvern heart Folded in amber; she rolls royally, A creature laughing at eclipse and shame, Strong with the heavens about her for a shield, Fierce with all seas beneath her for a road— Stay and count twelve—Death has gone up at her In a mist, in a wreath; and now black-red she falls Under the horizon dead! RABAN My conqueror, Go and return a king? CONRAD I strike for life, Not for that other bauble. RABAN As you please. Strike deep enough and do not reason why. One sleeper more gives morn to all this land: One who sleeps always now; thou dost but heal Some few and meagre waking-fits in him. Go, with the footfall of a bridesman, go, Who sees ahead the portals bound with flowers, And hears the tinkle of the lutes within. Go! Doth my feaster, raising up the cup, Tremble, because in tasting deeply and long A little red runs over? CONRAD By my soul, I hunger, I am ready, he is slain. RABAN Wave only thy great hand and it is done: I will await thee, meanest of thy slaves, To wipe my master's blade. CONRAD I hear a wind That calls me—and farewell! RABAN It brings the day. There is a noble incense in your speech, Which breathes like battle mornings. On my soul, You shall lead men yet as a king should lead. You have royal makings in you. We have seen Your star arise in our oppressions: come, You, much desired of all your aching realm, Fearless ascend this tyrant's empty seat, Empty it is, raise but your finger, lord. [Conrad goes out, but, after a pause, he re-enters hurriedly. CONRAD Now by that orb which I shall never snatch, All is ruined, all awry. Here's Adelheid Roaming the court to find me. I must pass her To reach her father's rest. O mocking gleam, That shows us for an instant diadems, Then glooms and they are gone. I hear her coming: I think she weeps. RABAN I wish she wept in the grave, For Satan sends her in to tease and baulk us At thy most golden instant. God! these girls Come whimpering in, when earth, air, man, and fiend Would crown thee in the deep and fleeting hush Of opportunity. All things conspire To make this moment ripe to king thee, and, Lo, The whole stupendous fabric of thy onwards Cracks into shards: at what? A girl's tear! Folly Can shear no closer fatuous Samson's curls; Thy Delilah will cord thee nicely! CONRAD Rave not; I will obey thee; speak suggestion— RABAN Dawdler! Brush her aside, be rough and short for once; Roll her against a column, if she block Your onward foot; admit no question. God! This tinted fly spoils the best cup of wine That life has brewed us—She must flutter in. O, snatch her out and drink. CONRAD Shall I turn churl Through peril of my life, and put to use Discourtesies with her I love? No Raban, That's in no soldier's bond. What knight of worth Lives at such ransom? RABAN Fool of love, remain And chatter with your puppet. There's more pith Of purpose in my small distorted body Than in this mountain of an athlete. I, The hunchback, must be man, if you fall kissing; And pocket up vengeance and enterprise, Because a white wench meets you on the stairs— No wiser than a bull!—Give me your knife. CONRAD Insolent! RABAN Nay, forgive me, gracious lord, Why will she come just in the nick of mischief? O friend, O captain, O my King (that may be), See you not how we're each of us dead men? I say, no better; therefore, I must smite, If you will dally. Prithee, give it me, The poniard—now the parchment—That's my Conrad. I, hunched and frail, have might enough for him. He is unworthy carrion for your sword: I am good enough to end him: give the word, So your assent shall arm me like a god With mandate to destroy. CONRAD Go, in my name And slay him: on my head be half the deed. RABAN I go with a light step and merry mind; To knife a tyrant cuts this baby world Clear of another leading-string. I'd rather Do it than build cathedrals. Breathe on me, Such as I am, great mother Liberty! Breathe Brutus' might on thy mis-shapen child. [Raban goes out. CONRAD The end comes swiftly: I have touched the spring, And all the cogs and wheels in Death's great mill Begin revolving, grinding, buzzing; earth Seems trembling fathoms down—My God, he is gone! Shall I recall him? Nay, the chance is timely, Which rinses this red errand off my hands, And gives me, as foul deputy, this toad, Who loves to limp, and trail his bloated paunch In any slimy bloodshed.—Has he reached? Nay, listen, there his halting footfall drags— He pauses at the chamber of the King— He speaks with some one; ay, that's Adelheid: Now silence, and a knock: within that panel There lies the doomed one, in my fancy dead. How will the old man look when it is done, How will the marbled mask and thin grey face Seem then? I know so well its angry turn. Will Raban falter? Hark! He passes in; A door swings and he enters. The great God Sits up in heaven and listens. At whose side, The pale torn Christ with percolating drops Of blood, like black-drawn tears, beneath his thorns— Maimed as we maim our brother every hour, Ghastly and white, as in their road-side chapels— Sits pointing down upon this murder! [Enter an Usher hurriedly. USHER Captain— My Lord—the Princess—instantly must see you. CONRAD I come—as instantly do thou be gone! (Exit Usher.) This green-bronze carrion-fly must haunt our shambles, Just when the ox is hewn.—My soul is sick With all the crowded bloodsheds of the world From Cain's first blow to Raban's latest knife. I seem to see below me the abyss Grinding its rocks with scummy waterfalls; Which, as a cauldron spills o'er pitchy sides Turbulent drenches of wan smoking waves, There simmer interfused from wrestling cups In far-down chasms full of mist, and great With voices of torn tossing floods, most dim Save for some ghostly streaks of heaving pools. And, at the utmost outlet of this gulf, A river shears itself and bounds away With such expanse of turmoil that wings only Not oar or sail could traverse. It soughs up Foul exhalation, and goes swinging on By red-mire banks, sodden with scurf, and set With curled imbedded branches hung with pale Dead drift of grass and rubbish, like old snakes Drowned in the deluge, sun-dried. There are some Back-pools of calmer current, but they harbour Things that should be i'th' ground with broken sides, Who rock and fester, rainbowing with pollution The face of the water, oil-like, on black slime And the rough root-tags of abolished reeds— A sickly dream—Is he about it yet? [Enter Adelheid hurriedly. ADELHEID Thank God, that I have found you— CONRAD (absently) God may claim Some thanks to-day for such a treasure trove. But, by the stars that mete us from to-morrow, You may play hide and seek through all the earth And not refind me then. ADELHEID You're ill—or wounded? Why do you send at me such dazed blank looks? I know you are in peril, woe the day, But Danger never looked through Conrad's eyes In such an eager, wistful, chidden glance, As now I quail beholding. O my best one, What direst bolt, what arrow barbed with ruin, Forged in the devil's stithy of mischance, Hath given you such a face? CONRAD (still absently) 'Tis a rough day, And we who try to keep our feet i'th' gale, Must needs look grim about it. I will simper When the still air returns. ADELHEID (indignantly) I will depart, If biding I displease. Our vaunted love Has only grazed your soul with swallow wings: You're a slight lover; now I know this, sir, All can be mended easily: my father Need bring no prison key. You give me up, And so pass free and harmless. CONRAD (aside) Shall she leave And so misread me? Ay: let her be gone Wide of this cresting skirt of ghastly wave. (Aloud.) Yes, my sweet, go; see, I am ill, am absent; To-morrow I will make my Love's defence, And you shall hear his wherefore and his why; Till then, he can but droop with imputation, But kiss him now in faith—O sweet, go swiftly. ADELHEID Whither? To beat upon my father's doors And beg thee free! CONRAD (aside, with a painful change of manner) Go rather to hell's brink. (Aloud.) Nay, to the west wing of the palace, past The noises of this bustling eastern side. ADELHEID Come, then I'll look thee full into the eyes, And see what I can read. By Mary's babe, This fellow is afraid! (Starts from him) CONRAD Sweet torturer, Spare me an hour and go. ADELHEID Are you so beaten By the wild panic of one stormy hour, That all your love is shaken to the earth Out of your life, as summer dust is shed From an old nuptial garment? You—a soldier— And only love me to the point where Fear Stands sentinel with levelled arquebus, And cries, ‘Halt there: no further!’ CONRAD (throwing off his previously assumed manner) To the winds This counterfeited coldness! I refuse To hear my passion treasoned, meted out By lying landmarks. Fix a fence in the sun, And plant a quickset in Orion's sides, Yet will the boundaries of my vast love Be still unsounded. O you speak to try me, Who love you to the very brinks of death, And in and under through the grave-flag's earth, And out beyond into that fiery void Around God's seat—so far my spirit's arms Will clip and carry up its earthly love Beyond the white point in the burning mist To which, as to a presence without form, The seraphs bend in fear and veil their eyes Stung with tremendous ardours. ADELHEID There again My wonted Conrad spake. But as for him, This cowering hangdog double of yourself, What did it mean? Why must you grieve and mock me With such an abject mask? CONRAD My ruined rose-face, See, how I love you even in this. I stood Scared out of hope and broken out of heaven, Until I heard the ripple of your robes And the echo of your foot-fall. Then, O then, The thunder-veiled seclusions of my deep Began to move with rays. My soul, all cloud, Took in a little day. Until your voice Came thwarting through my mirk, I held myself Brother to fallen spirits. A black bar Seemed laid across the white page of my life. I felt, by forecast and pre-ordinance Of the great God, one of the devil's goats, Who bleat the wrong side of the throne. I said, ‘If I am lost, I will be lost yet more, And I am ripe for any fiery deed, Ready to push in the furnace my fool hands, And reach out roasted fruit for any fiend, Who holds me worth his prompting.’ And one came, And when you joined me he was newly gone, But his black cloud was left. You found me in it. ADELHEID Ah! Raban, on my life— CONRAD But now, love, now, At the mere touching of your innocent hands The veil of my impenetrable ire Cracks o'er my head and on each side slips down; While Heaven breaks out around me, star and blue, And star-points passing into cherub heads, As the gulfed azure arches and melts out To perfect nothingness of white. ADELHEID My brave, You shall not go to prison. CONRAD That's past sureness That I must go there. Mercy's dead and rotten And tossed into the ditch, while her successor In this accursed house has holes for eyes And rows of grinning teeth. He does the office Of our dead Mercy here. ADELHEID O silence, darling; They shall not drag you to this death, unless They hew you out with hatchets from my arms. CONRAD How prettily this passion speaks in sunset Along your cheek; means it my night must follow? Strange is it not, my child, in whose most sweet And rainy eyes compassion, like a gem, Continually glistens? Yet your pity Is perilous and brings no wedding garment; But rather sits beside a grave half-dug, And sews upon a shroud. 'Tis strangely settled, That, if a man think love of you, death comes To love him instantly. Would heart suppose, That in the wondrous lips of my fair peril Resides a subtle foretaste of the ground, And on their curves and in their coral corners, Dust interfused? O, let me press them, sweet, And drink this dangerous vintage: I discern Only a pleasure of faint April dews Rolling buds open. There's no grave-taste here. May be, you carry death-power in your curls As Samson carried might. Come, let me poise them: This hair is full of pale and perfect light, Which lives along it, like the subdued sunshine That saturates a mist. Beautiful witch, In your great fleecy waterfall of tresses, Consider, they are going to shear my neck For playing with these ringlets; they are royal And saved for kings alone. For me remains The narrow porch of clay. You'll weep a little? Give me some tears, I do not ask for many. Nature will dry your eyes in her good time; And I shall lie contented in my tomb Hearing no rival's kiss upon your mouth; Ay, they shall send and fetch you a fine prince, Out of some petty kingdom past the hills, To come and wed you, with a pretty face In a fine suit of clothes. ADELHEID You break my heart. Is my love made of such slight elements, As, in the wasting of one moon, to dance To other wedding pipes? I cannot change, And sea-like catch my colour from the cloud That passes any hour. If I must lose you, And after such a losing move and breathe, I will cast earthly love behind my heel And put my heart to school with solitude, And seek the grey walls of some sisterhood; And speak to no one but the pure white Christ And Mary and the saints; who spring like flowers In the cloud-furrows that go round God's garden. But now I hold you given me of God, And will not slip my cable-knot of arms For any wrench or shock of human danger. These myrmidons of darkness, let them come, And chain us in their foulest prison-cave Deeper than ever mole made winter-house, And strap us there together in the dark; Will not that sweet ‘together’ shed its beam Over us captives like a lamp of God? CONRAD Like a pale snowdrop manacled with chaining Rime ropes and steely links of icicles— So would my darling be. Shall she wear fetters For one poor soldier out of grace with kings? The dungeon bread is sour, its water dim; But that's not all. Some prison implements Remain of direr import. One sore dream I dreamt; that in this sepulchre of cells Waking I found a masked bush-bearded man, Who leaning, large in darkness, tried his nail Along a great axe with an upturned edge. ADELHEID (sinking back) Mother of God! sustain me; is light gone Black all at once before my swimming eyes? Slay thee, who dares to slay thee? My swift curse Wither his wicked head and impious hands! CONRAD Peace, darling, God hath gone away from us. There is no more to say. ADELHEID Then fly at once, And let us palter with no more farewells. Most instantly begone: the stairs are yonder, And at their base free air, the boundless hills; Hurl thyself down with thunder of swift heels, Rush, melt into the night, and be no more Found than a tear of tempest. CONRAD O April face, What can I answer save a foolish sigh? ADELHEID My God, he will be taken—Are you mad? CONRAD O queen of tears, I need no saving, none— [He listens, and continues absently And, if you hear a wind there's nought in that, And, if you hear a raven nought in him, For men are slain at all hours of the twelve, And some bleed very little. ADELHEID Are you mazed To give me riddles here; to stare and tremble? I feel we both are in that frightful hush Which comes before a tragedy; I know The air is heavy with Death's angel sailing In the gale round our turret; I am sure That yonder narrow morn-beam will divulge A day so hideous, that my after years Will blench to see the map of eastern heaven So coloured till I die. I know you're menaced, And, therefore, think this danger strides at you; O, be not tamely taken, by the touch Of our first kisses, by that love of loves Which is between us, fly! CONRAD No flight for me: My place is here to bide and bear thee up; And, when this giant wave of sorrow smites thee, My presence, as a bulwark interposed, Shall break and blunt the gathering rush of surge. ADELHEID Come, bring me with this portent face to face; I will remember of what race I come And never quail ignobly. Conrad, husband, By this first-used, impossible, sweet name, Which God hath said, my empty onward years Shall never find, by this most strong adjuring, By this most tender word; ah, rend the veil, And tell me what is coming? (A pause.) Mute? still mute. Nay, then I've done. There is no more to say. God succour all. For I have shot in vain My sweetest arrow, my last bolt of prayer. CONRAD Adelheid! Adelheid! ADELHEID Merciful Heaven, Are you a man and weeping? CONRAD (with a sudden change of manner) Nay, a dog, Ay, meaner, if you will, a rascal rat, A fool's heart in the armour of a man, Who brings girl's eyes to gauge a warrior's wrong— A babe, a shadow, a most craven hound, One who would lick the thongs of his own scourge, And fawn upon the hand that knots his halter. Who lets his anger flutter, like loose rags Tied in a garden to scare off tom-tits. Who takes a tripod full of embered fury And weeps it out with pity—I am shàmed To let you see me shed this tear-stuff down, To let your love so weaken and woman me, That, like a noisy wailer at a wake, I cannot watch near death in silence—Hist! There—there again—The wind squeals like a mouse; Or the rats fear this tumult in the stars, And scale the wainscots in full cry—All's silent! Surely the end is near. (Aside.) Will he remain Millions of years about it? (Aloud.) Listen—a step Or a groan—which? ADELHEID You blench at any noise. The court is full of rumours. Night and morning Seem at great odds. See, yonder cloud-bulk rocks, Like a great sponge full of black rain. CONRAD The air Seems full of blood. ADELHEID Nay, you are looking out Through the red mantle of that window saint. That colours all the fields. CONRAD Ay, through this pane I see them green enough. ADELHEID So is your face Sick with some giant fear. I think that noise Comes from my father's room. I'll run and listen. CONRAD And you shall go, but hear me first. ADELHEID Your secret Glares in your eyes again. CONRAD O, love, it rends My very soul asunder, cracks my walls Of life, and here it is, a hideous babe To make the midwife shriek. Death is not much, And I will die to save you a little woe, Divulging this, for which I shall be slain. I whistle my great wrong down all the winds. And say, ‘live Sigismund, your daughter saves you.’ Run to your father's chamber, rouse the guards, Awake the palace, break his door with hatchets, Rebellion and Conspiracy inside Hang on his throat like leeches; at this instant I think I hear him fighting for his life. On, like a brave girl, save him. Is there time? Nay, by that groan which rings out, ‘never more.’ You shall not go: another king is clay! ADELHEID (wildly, about to rush out) Nay, not too late, if God sits up in heaven— CONRAD (gently detaining her) Peace, Peace, poor love; God sits there even now, And sees a new soul to his footstool rise,— A pale new soul who shows a wound to him, And frightens all the angels! Love, remain; Abide in shelter of my shielding arms; Here art thou safe at least and peril-free; And he is—as he is—monarch of fate, Beyond rebellion and the dagger's bite, The venomed cup, the envy of the clown— For yonder Raban comes with stealthy tread, And in his vampire face is written ‘blood!’ ADELHEID Conrad! my Conrad! CONRAD O, poor darling, peace! Do not provoke this bat, who slays the sleeper: I must awhile dissemble, speak him fair,— His power is terrible. ADELHEID Whose might, this worm's? I see a baleful cringing weakness only. CONRAD Hist! for thy life, love, hist! ADELHEID I hardly know What I am saying; all the world's a dimness! Enter Raban softly; he draws Conrad aside, and whispers. RABAN I have nicked the grey goose in the neck, and broken The feathers of his flight. (Looking towards Adelheid)—Get her away— He fluttered just a little and croaked twice, And then dropped quietly beneath his perch. It was just nothing; for another spite I would act the play again, find him again, Wake him again— CONRAD More softly, lest she hear— RABAN I reck not if she do; since you are mad To carry female lumber in your arms At your most ripe and golden hour of fate. Push her away, bar her out, bolt her in; We least require this fool of rose-buds here To get in the way and whimper. They must come, And find him in five minutes. Pack her forth! CONRAD (hesitatingly) This gentleman is full of weighty news— And therefore— ADELHEID (fiercely) I must go, and be content To rule my steps, daughter of many kings, At the bidding of one hunchback; neither man Nor gentle, but a slave, a fiend, a Cain, Once cringing at my instep; now erect Rearing his ravenous crest and venomed eyes, Because, because—How shall I speak it out? Dry fire is in my lips—My accents burn me— The world is going—Help me, Conrad—dark, A dark and giddy world—Ah—(She faints.) CONRAD (raising her up) She has swooned, Guessing her father dead. RABAN She has done wisely: I'd rather have her quietly entranced, Than pealing out her panic-stricken yells, Dishevelled through the palace. All goes smooth; Thank our black cherub, blessed among fiends, That at the gusty passion of this grief Her five wits flared and presently went out. May she endure a long trance and a sound one, While we divide the spoil, and garner in This royal orchard's ripe and fallen fruit, Unvexed by female clamour—Heave her down, Shake off this silken burthen from your arms; By Mars, you'll need both hands free soon enough For act more doughty than to pillow round These drowsy ringlets. Up, man; she will do. Bestride this passage. Give all comers steel. Whip out your sword. This knave removed and dead May gather friends; who, present, with his whims Curdled all duty. Pity for his blood, With certainty he cannot plague them more, May make him half lamented by some fools, Who will give trouble. Therefore every second's A kingdom—up and act! CONRAD (leaning over ADELHEID) As beautiful As happy death in its first day art thou! Nearly as still. Did I not count her heart, I might believe, that her pure ghost had flown To uphold and prop her father's weary limbs That stumble on the coasted crags of cloud, Which base an arduous paradise. She breathes A little; yes, she breathes. O pale love, rest And sleep, till this most hideous incident Is covered up and cleansed away. Sleep, bird; Our waking life does not deserve thee back. RABAN Lover and fool, zany and moralist— Unless I anger him our cause is gone—(Aside) Pity will keep and kissing, ay, for that; But, by the prince of sulphur, in an hour Thou shalt be torn in pieces or a king, Have dust between thy fingers or an orb— So shake thy wits together, stand upright, And meet the roaring of this flood, that comes To trample and abolish. CONRAD (rising and coming forward) I am thine now. Weakness is dead. Listen! Like many leaves Roaring along the forest-paths, they come! And I forget my guilt in one great joy And pulse of onset, which along my veins Is leaping, sweet as love. O, let them come, I feel a king already in my heart; (He goes to the window) And yonder, see, the sun in nascent fire Lifts up his orb, and first beholds the realm Of me, King Conrad! Yonder is born in heaven The first day of my reign: I am King!—King! RABAN I draw free breath; hail, safety! Roused at last— But only just in time. See, hell-gates bulge And all the devils leap over and rush in. [Enter many Guards confusedly. GUARDS The King is dead, is murdered, the good King, The poor sweet King; who did it? where hides he? Blood, give us blood! O rare to catch the wretch, O sweet to hunt him down to death with dogs. O joy to crack him slowly upon wheels, To rend his fibres, revel in his groans:— Is he here? is he there? No! Is he yonder? RABAN Hearken and hear me. If one king be slain, Who was a shadow and no king at all— Not for that reason say, the King is dead. The King dies never. Yonder is your King, Who rises as a sun-god glorious Out of the old grey ashes of the Past. Regard him, see the ineffable great smile Of kingship lies already on his lip, Calm as a god's. Is this the man to lead you? Is this the man you love? A hundred ayes Leap from your lips like thunder. O, well done, Roll out upon the dawn with loud acclaim The voice of our election: we have chosen A king, a king indeed, the flower of kings, None more beloved, none fairer, none as brave. And I, my liege, kneel to thee first of men And kiss thy royal hand with duteous lips, And rising cry—and so cry all of you— All hail, King Conrad! GUARDS Hail and live, King Conrad! FIRST GUARD The wise God keep and hold thee in thy throne. SECOND GUARD Come, let us cross our spears and raise him up Over our heads; and then, with one fierce cry, Tell the most distant stars we have a king! GUARDS All hail, King Conrad!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. ACT III. SCENE I. Ten years are supposed to elapse between the first and second part of this Drama. A room in the Palace. Enter Conrad and Adelheid as King and Queen. CONRAD Is Uriel, Count of Gemmingen, to die? ADELHEID Ay so, my lord: I gave you yester-eve A ream of reasons for his instant grave; And his revolted vassals die as well Around the master python of the nest. CONRAD This doomed pretender to our rightful throne Has sent me into gloomy retrospects. I too—aspired. Well, that's a decade since: Time kicks along his foot-ball called the world ADELHEID I saw these filmy musings pass your eyes, And caught your mood infected. I too went Stumbling and scaling through our craggy past A great way back. CONRAD The crisp-foot winters go, And the stars turn in ether. They have danced Ten times, it seems, the bunches into must, Since you and I have taken seat to rule This fluctuant and many-tided realm. ADELHEID You know I love to sit within that oriel Which looks toward Arnheim out across the square And burnished downs, hard in their folds of grey. Well, there I went this morn,—for you had gone, To see the cage of falcons just arrived From Raymond, our king neighbour to the south— And leaning there, I said unto my soul, I will sit down and be alone to muse, And look behind along this road of years; Which, since my father died and you are king, We twain have traversed, rough malignant ways, Where—though we went with faces well composed Before a watchful people, though we wore Spiked gold as garland, and the sea-shell's dye To make our clothes as heaven between its stars, We felt not less the bedded flints and shales Torture our foot-sole like a path of knives. I saw our road had been o'er one great moor, Ploughed into tracts, which intercrossing ran To every point of heaven: vast heathery sweeps, And here and there a bench near one small pool With nothing but a bulrush and a frog. Then came a shelf of tawny dunes which sent The way-sand to our knees. Then a bare plain Of hard cold clay, and in a fenceless garden A black and broken wind-mill, which we made An inn of brief repose. Thence, passing on, We picked our paces through a desperate place, Green-scummed, or else with bald and pasty mire Cracked into net-work seam of hardened marl. There the heath faded to a mongrel marsh, And then the marsh at odds with a red stream Fought for the land between them; then rose up Again bare sand, upon whose limits lay The margin hills in many a ruined heap, Morsels of weathered steep and wasted cliff Tumbled and hoary. O, the land was bad And blind and sodden. Finger, ear, and eye Recall it loathsome and condemn its vileness. Bad, bad; I'm weary of jogging by foul roads To the market-hall of Death! CONRAD Is my queen tired With but ten years of queendom? ADELHEID That I be; And of all earth-fruit, save my husband's love And infant's smile, most sick. I live for these And, losing these, I perish: they inspire Coherence in my elements of life: Withdraw them and I drop asunder, dust And shadow, husk and ashes; in your love I breathe, and therefore you must answer back With burning adorations, and eternal Enormous antiphons, which, if I die, May echo on. For, even in the grave, I think, that I should hear you through my sleep, Leading the hateful rival to my home; Ah, I should hear your kisses, though the earth Lay many fathoms deep against my ear. CONRAD I love you in the frank and silver day-light, I love you in the sullen churlish grave; In the bubble, which enrings this little moment; In the vast iron wheel, which girdles round A thousand centuries. But, good my queen, These are phantasmal sorrows, quite unborn, Who may not gather life to break the womb Of many-childed Future. Will you spend Your strength in fighting air, not husband it To bruise this arched solidity of treason, Coated in hardened mail of steely scales, Who must slay us or instantly be slain? Will you, with such a portent in our doors To be encountered, go out to the waste And beat the bats down? ADELHEID Ay, we swarm with treason. Shall we be never ridded of this old And tortuous Hydra? Will she always dart Her flat and flickering unexpected mouth Of out some new rift in our palace floor? And must we sleep and walk and eat our bread, Knowing that in this chink, or in the curtain, Or in that wall she nestles. Can we set Our lip against no yellow goblet's rim Without a curdling fear, we may gulp down One of her snakelet infants coiled within Among the ebbing wine-lees? Shall we never Brain the blue mother's leprous crest, and fling her Dead out on garden offal? CONRAD Treason is The rust upon the armour of a king; We scour it bright but still the specks recur, Till the good suit wears through. 'Tis a disease I'th' metal of a leader. 'Tis a stain On an imperial breast-plate. Men unroyal Are spared this plague, as lower beasts elude Fever and palsy and the ghastly train That shake the higher man. ADELHEID I'd gladly sell A fathom of my queen disquietude For an inch of clownish peace. CONRAD We live in storm, We breathe storm in at nostrils, on our feet Comes the sea-storm and on our head the sky one. This elemental discord is our home, It pushed us up into our seat and there It holds us in—Still air would ruin us. The ruler is disvalued in the calm. I rode in here on danger's ragged vans, When the grey-browed confusion of the sky Scorched the dim purple morning. I took seat, In the sword-clash and the spear-clash—You remember— I feel your hands a-tremble—ay, you do— One certain hideous night, curtained in blood,— When I reluctantly did first put on This diadem and this most weary robe Of irksome glory, hating each of them And seeking neither. But the palace raved At sight of that red death-bed; and men stood Leaderless, wild with panic, at a word Ready to rend each other. This I saw; And, lest some dozen captains, keen as dogs, Tugging at diverse corners of this realm, Had pulled it piece-meal; and then slunk aside Each with his paltry cantle, mouthing it, And snarling on the rest—I, in this fear Of a split kingdom and divided counsels, Not loving Raban's deed nor yet its fruit,— So far assented for the general good; When I beheld a throne and none to fill it, An army, mad with fear, and none to lead them, A bed of sleep turned into reeking shambles, A hundred lifted arms and glaring eyes Signing me up into that vacant chair,— Wild, wrestling hands pushing the crown at me, A Babel of hoarse throats shrieking me king— Why! Then I yielded. One grim shag-face growled, Who presently did homage on my hand, That he himself had hewn it off at wrist, And sawn his sword across where now his lips came, Had I not yielded. See how mutable And wolfish be these soldiers, full of malice And peril, if you rub their wishes wrong. To save my life I yielded, to acquire A throne I to these butchers said ‘Amen.’ Was there no more to win by nodding ‘ay,’ To lose by thundering ‘never’? One dear head Lay in that turmoil nestled at my heart, To whom the grim deeds of that outer world Were blank as to a girl put in her grave. Wearing this circlet, I should wear her love As appanage more glorious than its gems. Losing this crown, should I endure to see Some brutish Captain leap into my place And gather up my kisses? Welcome hell Rather; and he was dead—not of my hand— Could my refusal breathe him warm again, Or pluck him up from Charon? By God, no. Therefore Love said be king, and king was I: And I accepted royal oil to feed The lamp of Hymen, and these purple robes,— Since in no marriage garment but this one Could I become your bridegroom. Love said plain, ‘Ye twain shall make no nest save in a throne.’ Who blames me then to have seized such glorious ledge, And built our eyrie there? In some deep rift Of stormy rock, twixt pine and snow, where-round The thunder speaks like a familiar friend; The lightning is our nestling's golden toy, And the winds rock him sleepy, pinnacled In peril, which is cradle to the great; Let the mean village sparrow hatch her young Safe in some farmer's thatch. Our eaglet hears The avalanche, the tempest, and the wolves— And if that night recurs— ADELHEID Lord of my soul, Peace of that night; let it and all its deeds Rest: so it was; and silence now is best. Some day we shall hold out our hands to God, And He will answer whether they be clean Or spotted as this Raban's, whom we loathed, Who is gone down whither he pushed my father By a most righteous doom, redhanded eft. And, as the axe sheared his throat scurrilous, Do thou with these, this countship and his pack, Who, as foul beasts in pen, await the hatchet. CONRAD How if I spare him? 'tis a shallow knave. ADELHEID Why, he will put a poniard in our babe, When we are grass and dust. CONRAD I think, you fear Too far about this Uriel, Count of Gemmingen; He is a sturdy rebel, if you will, And a most manifest conspirator. Yet all day long he sits with nose in mug, Soaking his wits, and vapours at the king, A gasconading rascal full of brag; How should I fear this barrel of a man, This keg of countship?—I am tired of signing Men into darkness. Let him go scot-free. All will suppose we sit on granite rocks, If with a careless hand we brush this fly To buzz again over his honey bowl, To sip or smother in the viscid nectar— Either, for all we heed or all we care. As for these rabble cart-boys in his train, Let them be flogged and go. ADELHEID I say he dies, Certainly dies, twice over if he might. This knave was born with danger in his blood, Though his head be a puff-ball full of dust, The lineage of this traitor countervails His lightness with the vulgar. In his cups He chatters ancestry with tavern grooms, And proves the king a clown to Gill and Jack; How, an he chose, and some day too he would,— His friends should live to see it, by the rood— He'd be, where in his right he should have been, Ten years come next November. Did they know, His great, great, great grandfather ruled them all, A monarch, ay, a monarch to his toes? But, as for this paid cut-throat called a king,— His pedigree the gutter, and his crest A dung-hill cock, who crows against the sun With motto, ‘As thou risest, I shall rise.’— A rank usurper—Did they like their wine?— How gat he up? Why this way—being young And handsome, as the wenches reckon looks, This swordsman by his graceful attitudes Catches a suitorless princess's eye, And wins her to his will, and— CONRAD Finish there: His doom is sealed. I thank thee, Adelheid. So let thy purpose steel my weaker heart. Give me the pen. Thou art the stem of rule, And I the light and evanescent leaves. ADELHEID O Conrad, I am tired of dealing death. Branded with age too early, iron care Has wrinkled up my face, and made my eyes Large, strangely-lighted. ‘Hush!’ the people say, ‘Pale as a phantom comes this queen of ours. She looks as fierce and faded as a ghost. Regard her not: regarding vexes her. She carries in those grey abysmal eyes The gloom of many sudden sepulchres. Her hand is like an eagle's wasted claw. God! will she never pass? O Christ, she turns Her eyes upon my baby, and the child Moans in its sleep. I think, her wistful gaze Would draw the very breath out at its lips, And yet I dare not veil it, lest she see And freeze its blood from going with her will. O Mary, make this vampire move away!’ So these poor fools misdeem and quake at me: Who wrap my pity in a tiger's fell, Being unwarlike and compassionate, But goaded and beset and hounded on By one supreme great instinct to preserve My husband and my offspring: motherhood And wifehood quenching fear; and, since our reign Came in no calm, began—as it begun— Some things must not be thought about at all— I saw thy road was thorny; yet I said, Whither thou leadest at thy side I come. Have I not made thee husband, conscience, god, The pontiff of my soul? Thy needing it Tinges an act with virtue. In thy name All service is most righteous. Justice is My Lord's advantage merely. To thy will The keys of all my wishes are surrendered— I hold her nothing in the roll of wives, Who will do less. Help-mate she ne'er will be, But some weak creature with a languid blood, Who cannot hear her heart-beat in these words. Have I said well? Have I done all for thee? Then for my service give me one more grave. CONRAD I mark him from the living with my pen. [He signs a warrant, summons in an attendant, and despatches it.] So this man being done with, clear your brow, And smile a little. We, who rule, deserve To sit with happy faces now and then, As John and Joan in the cottage, shelling peas And plaiting rushes. You were rosy once As sweetheart in the song, but there's a winter Come to your face; as those, who cheat fat sleep, Are thinned in his revenges. All your vigils Would tire Prometheus strapped on naked stone. And, even when you sleep, I think your heart Fearfully wakens—like a pilgrim bird Who leans the outer feather of its wing Upon the sea and dozes as it goes Above the heaving peril. But you are changed With a great changing. Ah, poor altered flower, Scathed in the crushing of this weary wind, Your soft aerial petals harsh and dry; Can Care uncolour splendour in so brief A tale of turning moons? Can some years slided, Unbloom the radiant aspect of my bride Into this haggard mother of my child? ADELHEID I have outworn the polish on my face, Outgrown the bridal plaything that I was Into thy wife. Which means, not less nor more, That prodigal of beauty's tender skin, Reckless of wrinkles prematurely earned, Bare-headed in the snow wind I will sit And listen to thy turmoil. If my lord Goes at a cry of war upon the hill, I'll out as well and wrestle in his wake, Beaten on hand and brows with stinging hail, Disdaining shelter. Is thy path o'er peril? I'll tread on adders too. Dost walk in blood? My feet shall redden to their ankle-bones. Are men at watch to slay thee? Watch they may, They'll need to wake till either eyelid flag With leaden rims of slumber, ere I doze Upon my counter-ambush sentinel. For Love is vigilant, when Hatred snores From utter weariness a bulk of dreams. Are thy foes cruel? I will pass them here, And in the service of mild Love devise Such bitter curious death-ways, that the fools Shall falter back astounded and cry ‘Hold! Thou art the better mechanist of torment.’ But these things age one. She, who'd save her beauty, Must keep it closed within a crystal cupboard, Out of the air-stroke. Had I been a craven, I should have worn my roses longer, King! CONRAD When you are angry, you are beautiful As on the first day. Turn your face a little, Just from the full. You seem Medea now Fuliginous and grandly moved. They say, That we, the world-kings perched so very high Between the frozen zones of drifting honour, Get seldom loving wives. That fruitage grows More in the garden of a delving loon. Well, this wise moralist, the common ‘they,’ Trips now and then. Our story proves it liar, And so Medea's did. ADELHEID And who was she? CONRAD The pathos of a dim and ruined face, Which from the poet's pages, in strange sweetness, Looks down a thousand years, and makes the world Wan with supreme regret and answering tears. A fair great queen of very long ago, Against whose virgin lattice the grey fringe Of the black Euxine withered on her walls, Or crusted in its salt her casement flowers, Or, inland hurled with volumes of rough wind, Made the grass glaucous on the barren dunes. There in the day-beam she grew beautiful, And moonlight gave her softness, till she heard A silence in the garden of her youth, A crisping in the branches of her dreams, And a strange footstep—But this happened, dearest, Far, far away, out of our world almost, And ages back; and, where she lived, her nation Is gone and conquered out; and they again Who vanquished hers like rain are sponged away; And a great cantle of her tale itself Is utterly forgot. But all she left, All for a husband's sake; and slew her kin, And with his people she forgat her own; And, save his love, all wishes left her soul; Till she grew wasted with excess of worship, And from the censers of her own idolatry The incense cloud rolled back and scorched her heart. For to such fierceness and strange jealous ways Her love was waxen, that it irked the man And drave him into falseness; and the tale Flared into tragedies of blood and fire; But, I forget whether through him or her, When the last curtain of the fable fell, Its stage was littered with sufficient death. ADELHEID Why do you beat her sorrows, deluge-old, Into my ears? Why point her wrong at me? Why should I hearken to this woman's pain? Is she then re-incarnate from her dust In Adelheid, slave of a husband's whims?— My kin I slew not, though I saw them slain! CONRAD In no degree. Her story to my brain Swam idly in; as through an open casement A dry leaf flutters wind-borne miles away From the black bough, that in the winter-clad Coppice forgets the budding of its child. Resemblance finds no stepping-stone between you. This fable queen was jealous: mine is calm. And, if I wronged her—just for argument We'll give Chimæra clothing-scale and wings, And let her hawk at gnats that ne'er will fly— My queen would inly pine, weep stillest tears; She would not wave her wrong out, like a flag, For the raw world to see. But she would wear it As a continual sack-cloth next her heart, And, when that pulse of love broke, it should make The cerements of her pure and patient dust. So would she fade to heaven without a word, Saving her secret, loving through it all; And only God should read it in her eyes, Reaching her ghost its crown of martyrdom— That were a wife indeed! ADELHEID These hideous words Rend me their listener. Are our dreams so good,— Who sleep in porphyry chambers with the weight Of many maledictions on our rest, Earth's emperors—that, when we waken wide, We should take mist to mould like potter's clay Into such hellish visions? No, my Conrad, This demon May-be never will beget A fiendling Has-been in his likeness here. Trust in such utter mutuality Is grown between us, child of dangerous days, Nursed at the teats of our calamities, Rocked in the common cradle of the crime, That gave us leave to bear him; sent, when born, To try his reeling baby feet along The reddened floor of our consorted reign. This Trust of ours a hardy nurseling, grown Upon the knees of parents perilous, The scion of a Spartan motherhood, Is waxed and thewed, with no uncertain power, Into the perfect flourish of a god. Is not our Trust so holy and so large, That to imagine its divulsion seems Like laughing at a grave, like poison poured Into the golden cup of sacrament, Like saying, God is dead and flesh is God? Nay, we are one, in spite of fire and rain Or earthquake. I am welded and built in Between my kingly rock; as the white seam Of marble in the granite crag abides For ever in her mountain, part of him Though diverse. Will they quarrel and remove Their interlacing arms? Will they cry out To the hill-torrent, that she speedily come With cold wet touch and white persistent teeth, And gnaw them in divorce asunder? Nay! The twain shall cleave together till Heaven's signs Are sick with rifts of age; and the doom seraph Sails, like an eagle, pealing the great death Among the overwatched and wasted stars. CONRAD I tell thee, wife, we dare not spring apart; A furnace roars up at us on one hand, An ocean at our other side wails plunging. The foam-flakes and the cinders intercross Flung on our narrow ridge: we stand alone. Behind us is a terror of strange water, A smooth lagune laid inland of wild seas, Languidly heaving, in whose silvery threads The heads, the fins, the mounded ebon backs Of sea-brutes palpitate, pass, disappear, Till the deep seems one swarm of serpent shoals— That is our past, wherein such evil memories Paddle and come to surface, it is wise To lock our thoughts from skimming those scummed waves, And turn our backs upon the sighing of them; So, forwards creep by that sea-ruined mole— Dreadful to tread but worse to pause upon— Which we have paven with grey ashes, wrecks Of things that once were men, until our word Came on them and undid God's artifice, Poor broken worms—we crunch them, shudder, pass Into the blackness—onwards! ADELHEID Courage! dearest, See, husband, see, our mirk is riven at last; Our path is sweeter by one morning star, These wayside bones are goldened with its ray; No groundward gazing more: bathe, bathe our eyes In the white splendour and light innocent Of that young orb. O, fresh incarnate ghost, O, tender spirit hardly meshed in Time, O, ether-roaming and aerial feet Just tangled in the gossamer of days; Love's budded evolution, O my child, My infant beam, my rose bedewed with heaven: My little apple, blown a windfall down Out of the starry orchards, gathered up And tenderly brought here by some pale angel— Just sweetly fanning out light pen-feathers To arise again and float serenely back, With dreamy evanescent hints of smile, Their sister, to the stars—O dimpled babe, Pure day-spring in these desecrated halls, Empty so long of childish laughter, since I played a little maid with my dead brother; And then he went, and I played on alone More pensively; until one fiery morn I found myself a woman, at one leap An orphan, and a wife. One night did all, A hideous consecration, ring and shroud— Of all which things I would oblivion buy In your delight, O cradle-treasured curls; O dimly-printed lips, and finger-buds Weaker than rain, make me forget what farewell I had with childhood. See, the iron mother Bending above your innocence, the Queen Unduly old, broken and blurred and stained With taint of hurried graves;—Smile at me, babe: Babble and reach at me with crumpled hands. O'er thee at least this rumoured tigress bends, And makes soft murmur like the mother ewe. Shall not thy baby laughter cleanse the breath Of these polluted chambers, and flush in Virginal air, as sweet as sweeping over The brine-exhaling deep can make it come? We fester here, as in a catacomb Shelved round with acrid bones and pungent dust. Laugh out, babe son; we need thy laughter here. The palace corners rankle phantom-full. The grooved pilasters twist their flourished heads Into a puckered feature, Raban-like. The curtains droop into unearthly folds, Like trappings of some feathered funeral car; And drape out veiled contours and faded bulks, Which, if we touched them, might begin to crawl And move into grey kobolds, moth-like crabs With cobweb faces creeping out of graves. Ah, misery! Come quick, my morning ray, Abolish, purify these atmospheres, And sweeten out those heavy canopies, Steeped in the reek of centuries of sighs. For innocence is great and shall re-chain These emanations, at whose vivid eyes Fire comes in expressed tears. In their despair Thou hadst no lot or finger. Thou art pure, My Prince, my King, who shalt be. God shall build Thy baby sinews man-ward like a tower; And give thee such regality of aspect, As they, who bear themselves in thrones, should bear. Great he shall grow and mightily prevail, And conquer with a clean and wholesome heart, Pure soul, hands spotless. He shall never know The need of doing wrong and speaking guile, Because his seat is sure and certified By our anterior guilt, by all this blood Which cries at us, by all our leprous deeds. Therefore, the passing of his time shall be Sweet as a lute-string, and his spoken name Will taste as sweetly in his people's mouths, As in the April woods the violets are To one, who enters suddenly from the downs And beats into the odour with his face, For the dell burns up fragrance—Reign in peace, No spot need soil thy mantle lily-clean. But we are filthied over, breast and palm; We reek of fire and crust with furnace spume. We hurtle with ill shapes in Tophet vales To set thee on thy purple Olivet. I barely think one live man on this world Has ate his daily bread as we have ours, So shorn of peace, so sistered with despair; So nourished on disasters. Hath one man Gone, in our way, to bed with agonies And wakened with a scorpion on his sheet? I do not think, rest ever can be ours After the stir of all these tossing years; Peace will not steep our eyelids till we die. Toil, that is overtoiled, sleeps never much; So let it be. The reaper seldom eats Bread of the sheaves he gathered. Still the grain Is cut and in its house, and he is glad; And goes away into another land. So in hereafter, when our childish heir Feasts on that well-filled ear, security, Reaped by our sickle vengeance, we shall turn Rejoicing in our grave. Our mighty love Shall say, ‘We saddened to give thee good days, Our darling, it is well: we sleep in joy.’ CONRAD Thy words are sadder than a weary wind, That moans across rank grave-yards done with, closed, Where even Death sees now no more new guests, And seems the sadder for it. There abide Unwholesome sprawling sheaves of great thin grass, And unswept leaves with mildew on their ribs, And putrid docks and sodden hemlock stems, And such an army of black or orange slugs, That if a sheep tried grazing in this close He'd bite less herb than insect—Why, thy words Pipe as in hideous whistle through the chinks Of dead men's broken roof-flags. Ah, my queen, It recks not to remember how we clomb Up at this kingship. Shut thy mind and sleep. We wanted and we won it. That's enough; And we do mean to grip it, while we see, With tight unflaccid fingers. But I tell thee, Action's the bell to scare away these ghosts. Act, and the weary body will claim sleep, And drag the anxious soul to bed with him To share his slumber. But you woman-folk Cannot heal sorrow's shaft with horn and hound; Well, that's your loss. I cheat my care this way; Wade after bitterns in the mountain marsh, Or track the shadows of huge antlered stags; Get lost at night and shelter where I can, Sup on a loaf of rye and goat's-milk cheese, And quite forget I am a king at all. I do divest that weary fellow Conrad, Who seems an Atlas, orbed upon his neck With such a globe of sorrow as my realm. Who staggers up, crushed throat, chest strained, hands dug Deep in his flanks, beneath this giant ball Protuberant with mountainous arrears Of all the knotty cares which tease a king. Ay, so he stands, that toiled and moiling loon, My other self, one Conrad crowned with pain, Whom then I quite sough off and shed aside; And, like a galling robe of ceremony, Ease my free shoulders from and breathe at large. I half believe, I have left this plodding knave, Behind in the great town, more clerk than king, Wearing his eyes on crabbed parchment dim; Making the giant looms of justice spin, Making the lazy brooms of office sweep, Making the weary mills of empire turn— I half protest, there can be no such man, My worse and careworn double, left at home, To whom all viand delicately served In golden trenchers on a stately board Seems cankered with disrelish. Who is this, Who finds the black crust of the peasant sweet? Conrad the hunter. Sound that hunter sleeps; But poor King Conrad, like a shop in storm, Rolls in his sea of heavy purple folds, And never seems to find the haven Rest. ADELHEID Then up, to horse, my husband, and away To-night, at once, to-morrow. If slain stags Gladden the soul to gaze outside her windows, Not inwards at the darkness of her pen— O then, my king, depopulate your forests And leave no hart alive. Crown all your doors With antlered trophies. I can govern here, If our rough people know one bugle-blast Recalls you, panoplied at my right hand, To rake the reddening cinders from the mouth Of this rebellious furnace of a town. So ride away in peace, and gaily tread The scaffold face of this bloat Uriel down Among the shrivelled wood-leaves. Yet ride not With spur so rash, such loosely-gathered reins, As when your charger slipped one Pentecost, And bruised your brow and gashed his ebon side. Only a wife, my monarch, had you then To cheat the grave about. But now this child Added must make us patient of our lives. And, till our babe can cudgel menace back, O bear, my king, your life like a glass cup, Which any heedless footing may destroy. Think, in what scale our weakling would be weighed, If, stiffened on your shield, they carried you Out of your last of battles. Live, dear, live, Have greed of life, be vigilant of danger. My mother instinct turns me from the tomb: My weary queendom says, the grave is well— But now, enough! So, you will hunt to-morrow? Where will you drive your dogs? CONRAD An alp there is, An earth of foxes, foster-nurse of wolves, The mountain garden of the forest bear, Perched on the outward corner of my realm, So far away, so needled thick in pines, That eye sees nothing but brown flaky shafts, And hunters seldom penetrate thereon. Laid in a dog's-ear cantle of my land, It leads no whither. But my huntsmen say, Strange ruins crown those desolated crags, And in one basalt cave the ribbing bones Of an enormous python fester foul. I will ride sheer inside that wilderness And see what quarry I can strike. 'Tis sweet To cast a line into an unknown sea. ADELHEID Go, and my love shall guard thee as a shield; But bring me home some strange new mountain flower, Or plumaged bird unseen in these low lands. Return not giftless, else I shall conclude, That thou hast hunted down all thought of me As forefront of thy cares. SCENE II. A ruinous baronial hall in a retired castle, half-way up an alp, with dense forests around it. The walls are hung with old banners, weapons, and armour. There is a spacious fireplace at one end, surmounted by a carved, coloured chimney-piece. Violet and the Baroness von Minden. BARONESS Child, have you seen the ducklings fastened in, And all the chickens roosted for the night? There's a plank going in our hen-house door, And more's the pity. Somewhen, an' God please, It shall be patched. Remember, how the foxes Gnawed at it all last winter, yet it baulked them, Though, as they bit, their wicked mouths, I'll swear, Ran water at the cackle of our hens, Safe, yet so near their noses. Well, well, well, Who can outwit these hill-thieves very long? Some night—I know it—in what you call your dreams, You'll leave the door agape. Up swims the moon, Lights the red gentry in, and, ere day springs, My office will be this, to wring my hands, And stare at empty coops. Nay, girl, go to— I've dreamt it more than once! VIOLET Saints mend thy rest! That was a grievous dreaming—all came home, Chickens and ducks, damsels and grandmothers, These cooped securely, those well castled in: Robber or fox will take no bite at either For this one night, content thee! BARONESS Malcontent I be, who hear such ominous rash jesting. To boast of safety beckons woe to come, And with misfortune wings to-morrow's heels. VIOLET Fast bind, I say, fast find! Let omens rest. Young hearts ignore foreboding superstitions. To-night my heart is lighter than a bee's And full of honey. God is good and smiles: And not a leaf rosette in all our mead, But promises a silver-rosy daisy Soon to arrive—in the new spring, ay, spring! The word will set me dancing by itself, Kiss in the ring my daisies then will play! BARONESS I heed them not, they serve no kitchen use, Or medicinal purpose. Now your burdock Is good, your comfrey good. But we have wandered: I ask you, are the poultry safe? You tell me, The daisies wax. Lean profit in that news. VIOLET The hens are in their dungeon all secure, The ducks in fortress good of lath and wire. I turned the key and guard it, castellain, On the whole brood of velvety sixteen, The twice eight yellowish daughters of the pond. And, long ere this, their white-rimmed eye-beads black Are veiled in sleep. Round are their pretty eyes, Rounder than mine, which are more looped and long; Unlashed their lids. Pity, no more broke shell; An addled egg the less had made my age. BARONESS That's childish talk. You had better take your wheel Than make such silly computations out. Come, close the shutters, bring the candlesticks. The night draws in with auguries of storm And rainy promise. When I see the crag Of the great worm without my glasses plainly, Then say I to our foresters, ‘Bide in Unless you be fleeced as a wether is At eve of shearing.’ He who treads abroad To-night will bring his back and shoulders home, Soaking and smoking like a cottage thatch. VIOLET Alas, for homeless wanderers in those woods. BARONESS All honest folk are housed: you pity thieves: Such only lie afield on rainy nights. VIOLET Poor thieves, I pity them. BARONESS You are a baby;— But thieves bring up our watch-dog: is he fed? VIOLET Suppered and sound asleep! BARONESS Up here in the clouds, In this old keep with moss-encrusted face And rain-eroded turrets, peeling grey,— 'Tis policy to treat our watch-dog well. And yet I know not: he might wake the better, If that we left him hungrier than we do. For, sated now, he slumbers overmuch: Yet in another view he is stronger fed, And feeble empty. Compromise is best; Therefore, let him be moderately mealed, So will he guard us well. VIOLET He never caught A robber yet, nor will he ever slay one. BARONESS Now Heaven forefend! Who wishes bandits caught? Not I for one. He better knows his cue, And has, or may have scared a many hence. The saint he knows. VIOLET He is too old for fear. The very chickens mock him round his trough, And filch his bones away. The saints know this, Or they know little! BARONESS How you catch me up: You doubt the saints? What next, you heathen girl? So far they have saved us well, you know it, you! But not a nimbus more will shepherd us, If you must fleer and sneer at hierarchies. Who else have guarded these dismantled doors In the great wood? Who else have turned aside The fiend that walks in darkness? (A faint knocking is heard at the outer door.) VIOLET (laughing) There he is! BARONESS Who, grand-daughter? VIOLET Why, Satan; plain it echoed, His tapping finger. BARONESS Do not mock me, child, For all my skin is shrivelled as in fear, And underneath my coif the stubborn hair Seems to uplift in wiry strands. What heard you? VIOLET I heard the blown leaf pattered in the wood; I heard along the sea-ward fell a roar, As of great larches hurtling in the gale: And then the watch-dog gave a sort of moan, Hardly a moan; but, if a hound could sigh, I think ours did. BARONESS You are glad of Hubert now; They named him from the saint of Foresters. It was a pleasant fancy of your father's. That hound is not much younger than yourself; I know you just could toddle when he came. VIOLET Ah, my poor Hubert, kennelled in the cold To watch for thieves: you do your best to guard us, And that poor best is old and feeble-tongued; But once you were as brave as the bare sword, And so I will not laugh against your eld, Which is my youth, my youth! BARONESS He's purely bred: We had him from the kennels of the king, A tawny mastiff of the royal strain; Thy sweet sire begged the whelp,—God rest his soul— A good dog, why of need a right good hound, Kings are too wise to harbour useless curs. VIOLET Then kings are wise. All of them, grandmother? BARONESS Wise of necessity: I think no treason. The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no king— Who is not also foolish, as I be.’ That's flat rebellion, brother sin to witchcraft. VIOLET Then, being wise, must kings be also good, And, if good, very good or rather so? BARONESS You tease me like a brisk recurrent midge! The king is wise and good. No one is bad But very foolish people. VIOLET Grandmother, I think I should so like to see a king. BARONESS Why, bless the girl, you'll want to see the moon Walk, like a lady in a satin gown, Up yonder staircase next. You want and want, And seem to me to live in one great dreaming. You move about wide-eyed yet half-asleep; And, as for freaks and whims, your garnet beads Are less in number than your airy wishes, The last of which is merely for a king: A king indeed! Are you a baby still: Do you suppose a king would notice you? Or waste a second of his royal glances On such a little wood-girl, mean and grey? He has great ladies, very fair and tall, Who wrap themselves in crimson, and who share The love-glance in his eye. VIOLET Besides the queen? BARONESS Hem! I have heard so— VIOLET Then the king does wrong. No king of mine would do so. BARONESS King of thine! Hast spoken with one dreaming? VIOLET Ah, no, no. That would spoil all. He must not even speak. My dream king never does, nor moves his eyes, More than his brother in the picture-book; Who sits upon his steed, full-crowned, and glares In a grand kind of dumbness and disdain,— For so my lord of vision must ride by, Slow-musing, like a god who builds a world; And from his shoulder in the beam behind Shall float a grass-green mantle, like a wave Washed in with rainbow. But his doublet vest Must be an apple-rose, and clothe him round In sheeny closeness, as a serpent's skin. And his great war-horse shall be overlaid With tags and twists of shine, and proudly tread. He shall be dappled over, russet-red, And, like the mountain-strawberry in hue, Shall be his sinuous flanks; and such a mane I'll give him, that shall rustle, as a sail Dishevelled, when the wind goes thwart the field, And turns it back on his rider, like grey foam. My king must be a little stern i'th' face, Yet with the mildness of a weird repose That under-beautifies the sterner man. He'll look as one prevailing and to prevail, Yet with the heed of many coming fields To keep him sad and lovely. His sweet high glance, Whose fury no man living may abide, Shall change to dove-like dream its eagle fire, As, musing on his battles, in a turn Of the bare April wood, the sudden form Of the daffodil, borne on his vision, bends His thought behind him back to that sweet queen, He loves so well at home; and then his eyes Burn, as wells catching first the morning sun. BARONESS And so, being dreamed about, this king of air Is done with, and we waken. VIOLET Grandmother, This was not quite a dream. I saw a knight Just ere the owlet gloom, when windy rain Came up the vale and crows went high in heaven Whirling and waving, prophesying storm, And the great burdock leaves began to flag; So with the other wood-birds I came home, And passed of need, then black in low flared sun, The ruined chapel of our ancestors. I love to muse within its chancel, bare To ether now, a waste of grass and graves: In all our hills there is no holier place, No stiller; and this eve I entered in To strew some crocus o'er my father's tomb, And brush its letters. For a second I saw Nothing—so blindingly the level rays Beat through an ivy-rift of creviced wall, And gave black leaves and myriad-threaded fire Full at my face—Another instant went, And, as it seemed, the sunset opened out Its fanning rays; and, in their core, behold, A knight, a phantom; still as death he stood On graves and never saw me, for his eyes Were seaward, measuring the expanse of woods. I thought he might have slipped out of a tomb, For there is no live man so goodly as he Here, where the men are goat-herds, none sustain So graciously their raiment, and none seem To make their presence master of the ground That bears them up. Assuredly, said I, This is a shadow of the ancient dead Signed with the beauty of the realms of sleep— O, terrible, to meet his turning eyes— And at a bound I fled. But, half way home, I thought, I will return, he surely breathes, Creep will I, touch his mantle with my hand, And, if it melt between my fingers, whisper— ‘Depart in peace, thou beautiful dead man, Forgive and do not hurt me!’ Some few steps I did retrace, but the poor heart in me Died out and sighed, ‘I dare not!’ BARONESS On my soul, Here be a tale indeed! You think of creeping To touch and try the substance of a ghost. Why, it had blasted to its root your arm; Or struck you blind, or scorched off half that hair, We hear so much about, with sulphur-breath. You did not dare! By Paul, you dared enough, And wisely gathered up your skirts and ran. This was a ghost for certain—or a thief— Nay, ghost, not thief, for robbers haunt not graves, And so we tell this blossom by its soil. VIOLET Where do ghosts grow? BARONESS They breed in charnel flags, And hatch in musty shrouds. VIOLET Who lays their eggs? BARONESS The old bronze serpent, king of worms and flies, Who sits inside the bloodred heart o'th' earth, As a leech in the liver of a sheep, As a grey maggot nestled in a nut, Or an old frog whom miners find in rock. These spirits are his spawn, a motley brood Of many names and natures: brown as bees, Or shag-haired as black lurchers, or transpicuous As amber—one and all accursed of God, Crickets, who sing beside hell's furnace mouth— Ah, silly girl, why make me speak of them? A wild bad night to hold discourse on fiends: For, when the world shakes up its cloud and wind, They in such brewage swarm. VIOLET Ah, the wild rain, Hear how it crashes through the woods, and heaves Urns of great waters with a wasteful hand To deluge all the gloom. Beneath its lash The white plain of the immeasurable night Tingles and smokes and rattles like a board. The storm-sheet seems one scream of broken woods. BARONESS Come from the window: I ne'er saw the clouds Ride out the moon and race her bright again At such rash speed. VIOLET There gleams the chapel-gate; Are the graves ever weary of their dead? They might be on such a night. A grand rough night For some old phantom horseman to ascend, And mingle himself with elemental hail, And stride the bellowing rack. BARONESS Peace, prattler, peace— A terror twinges through my brow and palms— Hear you that strange and grinding echo? Once, Twice, and again! VIOLET It is the torn-off boughs, Which the wind blows like feathers down the night, And some against our gateway. BARONESS Are these boughs? God! And the walls are heaving under them, And with a crash our door falls inwards! Child, This is the end and death! [Conrad bursts in his way through the oak door, which drops into the hall with a loud crash. He is dressed as a hunter. VIOLET (hurriedly) See, mother, see; The ghost, the ghost of the chapel! [Conrad advances slowly, both ladies fall on their knees. BARONESS (sobbing) Spare our lives, Sir Robber; we are weak and women merely: Alone in the great storm with one old dog, Who cannot hear thee, he is deaf and sleepy, And we have no one else to guard us here. Two lonely women in a forest lodge, A place quite poor and ruinously old: We have no coin and very little gear, A trinket—one or two; a silver mug, An ear-ring, and a salver—nothing else. All these are freely thine: search, and possess, And go thy way rejoicing. I am sorry, Ours is such paltry plunder! VIOLET (slowly taking out her ear-rings) So we part, Poor little ear-rings, which my mother wore, When first my father saw her: both are dead: Sir Robber, you are welcome. BARONESS (volubly) There is more: Certainly more. This were a stinted all. There's more to come, heavy and solid, sir, Ay and indeed. O, I can hunt out more; But you will spare our lives? CONRAD (smiling) Most freely; give me A moment, lady, of silence— BARONESS Nay, but swear! Swear instantly upon Saint Mercury, Or any other saint who loved your guild— An oath, an oath I need— CONRAD Most worthy lady, If I continued to delude your fears, I were indeed that caitiff at his worst In whose most craven shoes and dastard deed I stand misread: no robber, but a knight In a strange maze of tangled mountain-road Belated, at your gate I wound my horn. I called, none stirred: I knocked, no answering step. Wild crashed the woods: and, in the pelting roar, My voice came as the buzz of some drenched fly Beating a window-pane with feeble wing. Last, in despair, for cruel ran the rain, I tried conclusions with your good oak door And basely broke him. For his timber heart Had provendered the worm ere I was child, And all the staples of his sides were gone; And half his nails were rust and could not bite— So in I drave and crave to be forgiven. VIOLET Right merrily we pardon so reprieved: I be an ear-ring richer! BARONESS Nay, come in, Come in and dry thee, man, and sit thee down. I had talked so long of robbers with this child, And the night rocks my aged brain so hard, That I ran mad on felons. VIOLET Will the knight Come to the blaze? CONRAD (aside) This child is beautiful As a song heard in moonlight. Can such flowers Grow under mouldy turrets? BARONESS Where be I?— Nay, but sit down—You have made me breathless, sir, And set my fingers trembling: my old heart Doth rarely race along: now think of this! I held you for a robber. Violet, quick, Take the knight's cloak and wring the raindrops out— You will be from the city, I expect. CONRAD (as Violet takes the cloak) My child, fair thanks. VIOLET Sir, I am turned seventeen. CONRAD Then let my thanks, misrendered to the child, Kneel at the lady's feet. Ah, little one, Wait till you reach my milestone in the hedge, And you will be less out of love with childhood. Why hurry in your hood of innocent red To that grey wolf, old age? VIOLET Sir, I am told To sit and spin here very quietly, To sit and sew here very peacefully, And thus I do; till, once or twice a year, A hint comes through our door of a great world, With real men and women moving in it: Who have at least a substance in their sorrow. But when I grieve, I grieve here like a ghost At shadowy chances of another planet, Wherein I lived: ere, dying, I revived From death-birth on this continent of sadness. BARONESS Regard her not: she chatters like a jay, And shifts her topic as he shifts his tree; Says a few notes on this, half hops, half flies Into the next behind it; and so on Through the whole coppice wanderingly shrill. That's Violet: you'll excuse her, good sir knight— A child, an evident child. She will discourse you Quaintly enough, if you've a mind to hear. I let her chirp away and spoil her so. She lives under the leaves in solitude, And talks to move her tongue, as a child dances For motion merely. In this nest of crows A maiden's lips might grow almost together, Or gather moss of silence on their rims For want of use. But, sir, your city dames Encounter rosy days, turn in the sun And mellow on the orchard-wall of change. They hear of kings and queens, and what these wear, And how the world rolls and the kingdoms grow. Think, Violet, think, this gentleman comes here From the great city, stranger than your dreams— Has seen the palace and may be a courtier— You serve the King, sir knight? CONRAD I serve him well. None better in the realm. Farewell rebellion, Were I his only subject. BARONESS (aside to Violet) Heard you that? This is a plain and loyal-honest man, We well may trust him. What he makes in the woods, And why he takes this thunder-broken night Of all the good dry days to wander in, Time and his talk may teach us. But he's honest, Upon my wedding ring. There is a shadow Of some one in his face whom I have seen. And now his cloak is gone, his clothes are good And richly guarded: robber? No such thing! You heard how sweet the King's name on his tongue Turned as a plum of sugar; now your thief, Your caitiff thief, give him a king to chew, Will spit and sputter; as a baby wries Its mouthlet at the falsely-bitter breast On weaning day: or, worse, will choke and heave And nearly burst with naming the great name, As some foul imp out of the sulphur land, Who has sucked in holy water unawares. But this our stranger cries, ‘The King for me, I love the King.’ Each of us heard him plain. This man is honest—hungry too I fear; And I must search our empty larder shelves To conjure up some supper for his dearth. O conjuration hard! Had he but come Last Candlemas, when our old sow was slain; Then had our store been level to his need. But now, child, now, how shall this supper be? We keep no jointed sheep for garrisons; Who could have dreamed this soldier must arrive? There may be found a radish or an egg— The Lord he knows—there may be. Hence I sail To gather up and patch into a meal The orts of famine. Sighs ne'er fed a cow Or promises of pasture grass a sheep: So I will up and forage in our pans. But you must with this hunger of a knight Remain; entreat him fair, yet heed him well Out of the corner of a watchful eye: One never knows: this supper! There's the rub! [The Baroness goes out. CONRAD She goes with gathered brow and anxious mien: My coming clearly vexes. I intrude Upon the gentle concord of your lives. As a wrong note, quite out of time and tune, I enter, snap the song and leave you discords— Divulge, O maiden, frankly: is it so? That trouble soon is mended. I discern, Methinks, a lighter accent in the rain: I can depart. Would I had never come To mar my welcome with a gloomy face And clownish ingress! VIOLET Nay, you shall not go. I would not send my dog into the woods. On half so bad a night I would not turn An adder out of doors to wade among The sheets of drenching grass. No, stay you must! CONRAD Why did our hostess press her forehead, sigh A fathom deep; and, piteously upraising Her heavenward palms, so part? VIOLET This gestured grief Is wider than the woe which gave it action. The choir of nuns, whose gates you overthrew As very Samson, is a fasting order; Seven days a week we shed no blood to dine; Our larder proves that this especial night Is meagrely remembered in our calendar: So our good abbess parted, wringing hands, Because a guest, tossed in by rainy Jove Upon our abstinence—a guest withal New from the lavish tables of the great— Must learn to live, as crickets do, on fire: For we have logs, and logs, to dry a man, But wood he cannot eat. Sir, you must dine On stores as slender as the shrew-mouse saves When days draw in. Sir, you will banquet here Much as the squirrel fares, on mast of beech, And musty acorns, and deaf hazel-nuts. Sir, you will go most leanly supped to bed; This indexes my grandam's face with woe— Say not I told you, when she comes again! CONRAD That trouble will not bruise a may-fly's wing, Or beat a bee's mouth from one rose's breast; So, let us smile again; dispreading palms Out at the comfortable heat, we bask Secure of that rough fortune overhead. VIOLET Were faggots gold we should be rich indeed; But, to recount our possible supplies, Bread there must be and milk there often is, And these combined are bread and milk; and then We cross into the region of ‘may be,’ And there, I think, our tower of famine stands. CONRAD I shall not famish—pass that out of mind— And so my little hostess is eighteen: And, since her eyes are deeper than the sea, And since the under-red of her attire Breaks in blue shadows as the twilight wave,— They could not call her any other name Than Violet, and so she Violet is: With what addition, pansy of the woods? VIOLET Von Minden. CONRAD Ah! (A pause.) One Albrecht of that name Fell—let me see—at Arnheim in the breach— Ten years ago he died: I mind him well: A tall, bush-bearded fellow with soft eyes, And forward-hanging tufts of tawny hair. VIOLET (eagerly) O tell me; then you knew him, tell me all! CONRAD I knew him none: yet did I note the man Enough to tax his comrades for his name— I think he died at Arnheim. VIOLET Nay, I know it, Assuredly he did; in Arnheim's field He made his ending as a soldier should. On their crossed spears they bore him from the fight, And laid him yonder at the oriel side In the full tremor of the sunbeam, pale And yet so noble. Then we decked his bier, And on a velvet pillow set his face, Fringed round with myrtle branches full of fruit; Whose orange globes mixed with his amber hair. And we put rosemary and cypress on, And southernwood, and those small fluffy blooms, Hop-headed, which we name flower of the dead. CONRAD This was thy father? ADELHEID Ay, my father, slain, Gone to the greedy grave beyond the reach Of all my orphan kisses: gone, quite gone! I would not be a soldier for the world, And yet I think I never could be wooed Save by a soldier; I should loathe a knave, Who heard the clarion pealing battlewards, And pulled the blanket to his ears and slept! CONRAD These were thy halls, Von Minden; this thy child! Well, it comes strangely round. VIOLET Most weird of all, Your foot was on his grave at sunset, sir. CONRAD You saw me in the chapel? VIOLET That I did, And stole away. CONRAD (aside, as he paces up and down the hall) Von Minden buried there! My land, it seems, is crowded with the slain, Whom I have led to Lethe. May I not plant A foot down without stamping in the face One of the victims of that chariot's wheels Which bore me on to glory? (Aloud.) Gentle girl, Forgive me, that your eyes are sorrow-dim And almost rainy. Let my careless word Effuse no further dew-drop. Weep the shamed, Weep not the honoured dead. For some die well, And some descend to shameful sepulchres: Bewail the last alone. Number not him, Who was your father, in the branded band Of the disgraceful dead. Ah no, he went An honourable soldier into rest, Unstained and full of glory. The grey sleep Of the happy dead laughs at our turmoil here! Why, you are moved?— VIOLET To one mere drop of rain, With a fair sunbeam winning through its mist, To hear his comrade laud the absent host. I live outside the rumour of the world, So far beyond its noises and its way, I never heard my father's praise before. And you, the consort of his peril, speak With worthier lips than others. At his side The same death-edge, that mowed him, grazed your cheek, And, passing, sheared him full across the stem. Ah, you have right to praise him: you were there? I know you fought at Arnheim. Who so mean To bide indoors that day? Traitors and fools! You were at Arnheim, sir? CONRAD By sworded Mars, Was Marathon without Miltiades? Did Fontarabia never feel the edge Of doom-dark Roland in its lurid glens Stained with the veins of kings of tournament?— Peace! (Aside.) I had half-forgotten, that I play The hunter in a wood-lodge. Let my speech Be one in grain with this my masking garb; Shall I unfrock my kingship to this girl With blaring out my battles? (Aloud.) Ay, my child, I simply was at Arnheim. VIOLET That I knew; And I revere the humblest vineyard knave, Who trod the vintage out on those red plains! And saw you Conrad, our head sickleman, Put edge among those living clusters, smite With weaponed palm? CONRAD I saw that reaper's hand, His face I could not see. VIOLET O, pity of that! I should have asked you, how he looked: what brow, Pallid or flushed? Was his eye rolled in anger, Or steadfast in disdain? You cannot tell me? CONRAD I was the most unlikely combatant During that onset to behold our king. I know his favour but at second-hand—(Aside.) They say, King Otho of the Romans took A mirror into battle. VIOLET I would give My necklace—nearly—for one peep at Conrad: But I may wish, and wear into a voice Wishing! What is he like? CONRAD Like other clay, Unless you set him on his crown; a proof That metal makes the king. VIOLET Nay, you deride me: But I would see this captain of my father, If only in gratitude. CONRAD Mis-grateful child, Von Minden gat lean kindness of this king, And dusty favour readily returned; His present was a shovel and some mould: Conrad has given to many such a gift: To death he led him: thither kings lead men. VIOLET I love the King: he shall not be maligned. CONRAD If he could see that fairy flushing face, The King would kiss his pretty championess, And love her back again. VIOLET I shall have done The last of all my blushes in my shroud, Ere I shall gain great Conrad's commendation. CONRAD In the world-play there's an odd scene-shifter, Some call him Destiny, and others Chance: He pushes antic transmutations on; A wood becomes a palace, and a temple Becomes a stye. VIOLET And what is this to me? Who sit i'th' street, and only see the awning Of this great acting-booth. CONRAD Strange passions tread Those stainèd boards. Bless thy exclusion, child; The sawdust of the scaffold, and the torture Which leaves a man mazed in an iron cell, And tears his reason from him into rags And leaves him mindless, as a waxen image, To drivel and rock his chain: all, all such shows Are here enacted; and, by Heaven, they are Most naturally given. VIOLET Ah, terrible! Tell me no more. I will stay here forever; I wish to see no king. The green-wood way Is the best, the lonely best. I will lie down And die among my daisies; one or two Field buds will fill their cups with sorrow near me; And I shall be wrinkled and shrivelled up, And quite, quite grey with seams upon my face, And curious knotted hands, when this same King May ride by once at last, and say, ‘What's here, This lagging leaf of blear humanity, Can women be so old?’ CONRAD When I return, I'll saddle Conrad's horse and hale him here To cheat this piteous picture. VIOLET You shall get Two kisses—if you bring him—Let the jest Endure—I say—two kisses— CONRAD They are won. VIOLET How shall I know him? CONRAD (throwing back his doublet) By this medal, child, Which, in the twisted gold of my knight's collar, Swings as a central badge: it will unclasp, And you shall have it—nay, you shall—'tis yours. Wear it in resting and in rising up At your fair breast. Who knows, but as a charm, Or amulet by eldish wizard blessed, It may draw Conrad hither. There's his profile: You'll know him now? VIOLET Right certainly I must. (A pause, then with surprise Why, this resembles thee! CONRAD So many say. VIOLET But you are older. CONRAD You are right again: Certainly older than this likeness is. VIOLET May not his knights, who serve around our king, By imitation of his princely air, Conform their feature after his great mould, By watching sun or thunder on his brow Evolving in alternate majesty? For, down the scale, assimilation holds, In instances of yearlong servitudes, Where old grey menials liken old grey masters. CONRAD 'Tis well explained: a very fair solution! I soon shall twin my master, as a trout Takes colour from the gravel and the weed He over-sails. VIOLET This king looks rather cruel. CONRAD He has been called so often. VIOLET Is he so? CONRAD One choice have kings—to slaughter or be slain. He takes the wiser: is that cruel, child? VIOLET Are there such plots and pitfalls in his way? CONRAD I've seen a man ride in a darkened field Where rabbits burrow. At each second pace Down went his mare in spite of tightened rein, And, once or twice, her pastern almost snapt. An hour among those perforated lands Only abridged a furlong of his way— That's Conrad in his kingdom! VIOLET Out, alas, And yet it seemed so grand and over-blest To be a great wise king and wear red gold, And wed a queen, as excellent as summer, And spangled with magnificence. Though stars Apparel her, she must lie many nights Wakeful in beating fear. I see the great 'Twixt fear and fear wear out a stormy day. I feel she fears for him and he fears back: Lest, being slain, he leave her desolate And heiress of a wide unmargined sorrow. I pour my pity, through vast intervals And from a long great way, on each of them, On her the most! Retired humility Is sorry for exaltedness in sorrow. Poor careworn soul miscrowned with iron thorns, Poor wakeful face misfeatured with long fear: I hear she is no longer beautiful: But she was lovely years and years ago; Ah, yes, I know she was. Tell me the measure Of her once fairness. CONRAD Child, she was right fair— (He continues abruptly) And in her fairness let that queen remain. Leave her at least her sorrow to herself; Our idle talk concerns her nothing— VIOLET Pardon,— I have offended you? CONRAD Nay, nay, my girl; You cannot reason how the tide erodes A shore you have not seen. You mean no harm, But talk beyond your vision. [Conrad rises and moodily paces the hall. VIOLET (aside, timidly) He reproves me— My grandmother is long and her delay Augurs not plenty. He will get no supper, And so wax crosser still. CONRAD (halting before the coloured and embossed chimney-piece) What have we here; Fables in wood? Figures in allegory Crowning the hearth? 'Tis quaint this sculptured text, For him who warms to read. Lend me the key Of all this coloured triumph, hares and hounds: Lucrece and Cleopatra: each i'th' act Of letting the red passionate life away, She with a point, she with a brace of vipers: 'Tis pitiful to see them stare and do it. VIOLET Old is the carving, and its meaning died And perished with the dusty-fingered clay, Which cut its cunning riddles out in oak, And left posterity to answer them, Here on the screen above the spacious hearth, Fronting the feasters—for they feasted once In merry olden days, where you, sir, sit And starve in this shrunk present beggar-faced— And every banquet saw the figured wall, But found no Daniel to declare its drift. And, if these letters meant divided glory, Glory at eve to go and ne'er refound,— Well they prefigured this worn castle's fate, Our empty hall, our family all dead, And this last girl, who racks her shallow brains With guessing the inscrutable. CONRAD But give me Your guesses. VIOLET They are woven out of smoke And built against a sunbeam, strange as childhood, Fantastic as the colours on a gourd;— Yet hear them, if you will. But, pray, remember That solitude will coin the very air For company; and think—ere you deride— That, lonely as some spider of the dew, I made the rays of every flimsy dream Converge into one centre whence I spun, An egotist Arachne, right and left, My threaded universe; alone in morning, I spread my laddered gossamer and caught This point of leaf, this rock-jut, this sedge feather; And, having bridged my space-gulf to the three, So that my dream might cross and come again With ease, as dew-drops down the trembling threads— I cried, I am the leaf, the rock, the sedge, The universe is compact of us four And we are one. Beyond us Chaos sits, And the abyss, brinked with unsounded shores, Succeeds. My contact bounds the scheme of things, The world extends to my rope end: no more— You smile? CONRAD I smile not: give me more; explain This mystic carving, apex of the screen, Roofing the storied interludes beneath, Dogs, dog-sized hares, and moribund great queens;— Declare this emblem. Here's a naked child Recumbent with an hour-glass in its hand, And the sand-cups are winged as Hermes' heels: While a great human-faced profile of sun Rays in athwart the infant on its bed. VIOLET Then thus—The child begins it. Her I made Clearly myself—I had none else to make her— An orphan in a wilderness of briers Naked and bare of any human love: Her fleet-winged hours are plumed with restless flight, Because they find no pinnacle of hope Or incident of joy, whereon to poize And bring down weary feet to clasp against In ease and satisfied repose. That part Of the image clearly runs, the sequel thickens. For this child's arms and face and feet are moulded, So as to seem equivocally posed Between a slumber and a waking fit, Not soundly sleeping, neither broadly awake; And so the artist drew her eyelids wide, Yet wrought such slumber through and through her limbs, And gave them attitude: as when a nymph Lies down effused with ebbing passion, ere Eyes go together, chained upon her couch With fiery lethargies and lazy sweetness, Seen in the flaccid arm-bend; as she sways Without a will to strengthen her drooped sides, And break beyond the precincts of her swoon, And taste the rough world's edge against her feet, Chill as the steely east-wind—So, until— Until— CONRAD I listen. Do not break the lute In the middle of the music. VIOLET Ah, but the end Is very foolish, though the rest indeed Was a long way from wisdom. Will you promise Not to laugh much? CONRAD Sweet, I would rather weep, So pitiful it is to see a child That always plays alone. VIOLET My fear is past To hear this spoken: I can tell you now: Well, I believe this child will dream and doze, And hold the feathered hour-glass through it all, Until—I broke there—whisper me—the sun, Who is the king of shadows, suddenwise Looks in upon her sleepy day and drives Her shadows dead before his tingling beams— Meaning—for I have worked this rigmarole In circuit round again to our old jest— That a king comes some day to love this child— For, since mere phantoms bear her company, It costs no more to build a king of air Than shape a clown of vapour! [Violet sinks back in her seat, and covers her eyes. Conrad rises and paces perturbedly up and down. CONRAD (aside) God, my God! Are we then flies upon the wheel of Fate, Whirled on in blindness where the driver lists? We cannot say, ‘Where goëst thou?’ Her face Is muffled; and one lean and wrinkled arm Protrudes, yearns forward, shaking out the reins; And from the grey recesses of her cowl, Drawn close, there croons a gibbering undersong Savage and hideous; as she wags her head To the metre of the madding hoofs, and sings To urge her vivid coursers foam-besprent, And give their wide and gasping nostrils air, And hearten their glazed eye-balls. On—on—on— There is a thread of blood set up in heaven Over a hive-like row of burning kilns, And a mad wind-mill, with one broken prong, Ploughs round in night and hisses, gaunt and sere; On these, it seems, that we are straining straight; And, as we batter through, the hedges crunch, And flint-beds churn out fire-sparks in our wake;— On we go. Where? My God, how should I ken? The driver, ay, the driver, ask her plan! VIOLET (timidly) Sir, you are pale, and tremble and speak low; Have I offended in my tale? CONRAD Forbear me— I have an ague-fit: 'twill quickly pass. 'Tis an old ache that lives among my bones. I caught him camping out. In rain he wakens And chatters at my teeth. Naught—naught, I tell thee! VIOLET Let me run out and fetch my grandmother: She knows all herbs, their secret surgery, And how in many a trampled weed resides Drugs to becalm the blood-beat of a man, And give wild fever eyelids. She will find A leechdom for this ague. [Exit Violet. CONRAD Curse of blood! We spill you and we push you fathoms down, And tread the clods against you and the turf, Saying, it is forgotten, let us turn To easeful sleep: no eye the buried sees: And in the morning on our very doors The deed is daubed in red, for all who pass To gape upon and read. I blindly said, The branch of this impenetrable wood Shall cheat the curse, which, as a blood-dog, quests Each footprint of my onwards. Hare-like, here I squeeze inside a form of tussock grass And fancy I am lost, as is a needle Dropped in a river. Am I not secure, As if the foam were rolled above my head, Under this sea of leafage ridged in storm? Here I can close my evil as in a cup And sit beneath the lid in safety, hearing No baying retribution on my track: Which roams my vacant palace like a hound Snuffing the corners for his absent lord. I have slipped him: that is well: I'll take my ease, And seem a kindly man with kindly folk: Talk an hour, chink our glass, laugh on the news, Meaning no harm, shake hands, and pass away, Braced with an interval of innocence, Blessed by the eld in going,—when, lo, here In the great waste of wintry woodland, here In the tree-desert, miles and miles inside it Belated, masked, disguised—at my right hand Pat, through a rift i'th' flooring, up it springs My old Curse; feels me safe, and, nodding gleeful, Whispers, ‘My spirit's brother, I am here, Bone of thy bone and sinew of thy flesh, Sun of thy gloom and shadow of thy joy: Our elements inseparably fused Bind us together; parcel am I and part In the rills of thy blood, in the bundles of thy brain, In the craft of thy hands, in the lusting of thine eyes,— One, till the end shall lead us down together In one grey shroud. Fool, thou shalt leave behind Thy entrails sooner than thy Curse. I follow, And where thou goest I bind thee to this doom— To bring contagion over innocence, Harm over all, and on thyself despair.’ For, as monks say, God passes everywhere, In the sea-deeps, in the star-deeps, in the void: Yet still, behind the footprints of its power, His omnipresent form projects a shade, Which shadow has a name more used than God's. So God proceeds no inch beyond the fiend, And his fiend goes no further inch than God, And either sails to the last abysmal star, And either furls his wing upon one shoal Bounding immensity. [Re-enter Violet. VIOLET (coming gently up behind Conrad) I will stand by; Wild are his eyes, I dare not speak to him, And these strange craggy words and fulgurous murmurs Wreck him like rocks, rive him like levin blasts— I will mark him further— CONRAD (aside) Peace, dark angel, peace: Ghost of the dead grim Raban, rest in thy earth, Rest; in my curse thy sullen feature lives, And is as thou wert: yet not wholly thou, But some strange welding from another sphere, Darker and deeper, is wrought upon thy face; And there's a wistful pity about the eyes Thine never harboured in their living orbs. I know thou gavest me my careful crown, I know thou wast my friend as friends go here, And in return I gave thee bitter earth To chew between thy lips. Why must thou take The innocent mist off some sweet meadow's face, Or burnished vapour of fair fountain-heads, To wrap thy sides corrupted? Darest reprove me, Who in thy day of flesh did worse than I? Tempt me no more. Thou seëst my will is free: The lion may degrade into the wolf, Into the serpent he can ne'er descend. My guilt has ever gone most lion-like, Not sneaking on its belly as did thine. The strong, the fierce, the mighty were my game, And the weak plaintive innocence of girls Passed safely through the trammels of my toils. I need a smack of thy maliciousness— Which ruined lurcher-like for ruin merely— To play this part with relish. Brace the will; I am free! This girl is lovely as the tint Which wakens in the yet uncoloured rosebud, When its faint pursed-up petals loosen out And catch the tinge of its expanded sisters, Who see the morn and draw its burnish in. She is too beautiful to be destroyed By serpent sibilation, this poor Eve In her wood paradise! Her dream-stuff life Makes her thrice vulnerably innocent: And my great office simply reverenced Would flash upon her as a beam of hell, Which she'd mistake for day; and open her arms And bosom to the smile of God, heaven-rolled, And kiss him, as a flower may kiss the sun-ray, In virgin adoration. Base, most base To stain her in the mire of such a passion, As my pre-occupied consorted life Hath only room to render. I have conquered: I have pinned this fiend's head quivering to the ground. My heel grinds in the wicked beating eyes: I am resolute to go. Come, roaring night, I fling myself into your great sweet waters; Purge me with storm, cleanse me with hurricane, Wash me in lustral waves—I win—I am gone! [As Conrad is rushing out, Violet comes forward and interposes. VIOLET You rush upon your death: you shall not go. Hear, how the woods snap like a bed of reeds Wherein a tiger tramples. You cannot count Three between flash and flash. CONRAD My child, my child, You would detain destruction. Loose your hands, Your pure and pitying hands, that pluck back Cain, That strain back Belial, that would save dry-hided Some cattle-minded faun, fit occupant For the rough brakes and rain-dishevelled glens;— O, listen,—on your beautiful pale life That makes your listening eyes so wonderful,— O, hear me, and obey me. Child of the flower, If I remained I certainly should love you; They know that up in heaven. And they know this, That it were kinder office to reach hand And smite you, as you are, the end and sum Of paradisal sweetness ever impressed On woman's limb, face, bosom,—smite you dead, Rather than bring my desecrated love To crawl upon the shrine, which is your heart, Like a toad spotted. This wild swamp of night, Strewn as with crags of torn and weeping cloud, Brothers right well my soul: I'll out in him—(A pause. Sweet, I am speckled so and patched with evil, That, if an angel came to comfort me, She would arise with gore-bedrabbled plumes Re-entering heaven a portent and a shame, Horrible from my contact—Weep, ay, weep,— Weep and farewell: ah, pure white hand, good-bye. It is because I love you that I go. VIOLET I cannot see you going through my tears: Stay till they stint, then go! CONRAD Nay, I will sink Sun-like behind their dim and rainy veil. VIOLET Go then, and God be with thee! [As Conrad is going out, the Baroness re-enters abruptly with a tray. Conrad pauses irresolutely in the broken door-way. BARONESS Ready at last! Fall on: come, eat, man, eat! I bring no feast yet famine I can slay. What, cloak on shoulder, hat-brim over brows! The man is daft: worse moans the night than ever. Be these your courtly ways, to crave repast, And, on its readying, vanish? CONRAD (aside) Miracle, Angel of these lone woods, why will you watch me Parting with such persuasion of soft tears? Why will you draw me back with the corded iron Of such a helpless sorrow? I am human; What can I do? (Aloud to Violet.) O darling, shall I stay? VIOLET I never bade you go. BARONESS There—say no more. The good knight bides, he has no choice but biding. Why should a man get brained with cracking pines? Soldiers are none so plenty for the war, That they should more unreasonably die, Than shrew-mice laid on autumn woodland paths. I draw your chair. Begin! CONRAD So let it be. Fate conquers by one moving instant's gulf. By the division of a hair, an eye-wink: She entered—and I stay! A moment later, Free as the storm, the woods had taken me. God help us all, say I! [They sit down to supper. SCENE III. The ruined chapel in the forest. An altar overgrown with weeds. A stone effigy of a recumbent warrior. In the background a half-fallen oriel window with gothic tracery. During the scene a sunset effect becomes visible over woods and mountains, on the horizon, through an ivied archway. Conrad and Violet CONRAD Back to the windows of my soul's desire, Back to the cote and lattice of my dove! VIOLET Thou steppest out of sunset: art thou here? CONRAD O cushat, on the cypress of my days Who broodest, ringed with rainbow, in a clearing Between two storms, the coming and the past, Am I returned too soon? VIOLET My loneliness Laughs, and my heart wakes up as at a bell: Thou comest unto me as my soul's angel, As dew to drought: I ne'er shall see ‘too soon’ Written across thy morion's frontlet bar. CONRAD When I departed golden words you lavished, And their effect lived in one brief ‘I love you,’ Which crowned me ere I went. Came absence then, Night's wearying gloom and morn's refreshing dew Have had their turn to come, arriving each With varied gift and fingers full of change. And each have rearrayed the sprinkled flowers About the gentle faces of the fields. And each have rearranged the starry host To sweep in newly-ordered onset round. God knows, in all these mutabilities My maiden may have caught a fickle tinge, And turned her love away to roam the wild An orphan and disowned! VIOLET Ask back yourself: Let this mistrust recoil and bite your hand. Love will abide till new love conquer him, Passion endures till passion push her out. New Love, new Passion, in this glen of briars, Hath any held their skirts, or tracked their prints? How should I vary? In whose wilderness The wolves are more than men: the men intrude Chance guests, the wolf is master of the house. For here a stranger's face perplexes us, Much as a meteor head of rippled fire Effused across the olive edge of night Between the lowest rack and heaving trees— How should I change? The memory of your shadow Has sat with me and moved and had its meat. Upon me in my dreams your parting glance Has burnt, and made the dawn ray, when it came, A pale and paltry fire. How can a bird, Who only knows one very short poor song, Forget the two or three lean bars of it? And all my narrow tunelet is of you. But you are from the house of changeful weather; Around whose base the gusty rollers come, And colour, as the vaulted cloud assumes New burnish from the changes of the sun— You have more right to know about forgetting. CONRAD A slander on your phantom, who returns Full-handed, as his soul is full of you. Here once you saw him and ran fearful home. Here you will see him twice and kiss him fearless, Once for the old fear, twice for the new gift! VIOLET A necklace, pale as ice yet full of shining! 'Twill match my garnets well—pomegranate seeds Above this row of dewdrops. I shall go Right queenly now. Love, clasp it on at once. If yonder brook less tremulously dimpled, Straight would I run and view myself transformed. Two necklaces, indeed! Now think of that! CONRAD Ah, but discard this paltry tinsel trash, These reddened beads fit for a peasant's throat: They misbecome your brightness, misadorn The clear imperial marble of your breast. Fling them aside! Joan dancing at a wake, Or Gretchen in a fair-booth cracking nuts, And munching buns beside her ploughman jo, Might find them well enough. But you, my fairy, Whose throat is moulded as a sun-rise wave, And tender-outlined as a sun-down cloud,— Shall hoop it round with such a beaming cord, That not the regal mother of the gods Shall bear such wavering dew-drops at Heaven's feast Between her shoulder ringlets—Clasp them on: Now seem you a piece of sunlight! VIOLET These round crystals Are clear and give no colour save in glancing, But move them and they bicker full of beams: And not one banded sparkle round the string Repeats the ray-blush of his brother's splendour, But hoards his shaft of glory to himself, And rings all changes on the chorded rainbow Each in his crystal lake. 'Tis magical: Can they be glass, and, if not glass, what are they? CONRAD Wear them, and ask no more. They are a gift Worthy of my great love: let that suffice you. As from thy treasury of precious lips With golden kisses I am overpaid. But there are many ladies, ay, and proud ones, Who, for a bauble like the one you wear, Would buss black Urien right across his mouth, Nor mind the reek of sulphur. VIOLET Fairy glances Of coloured fire! And will they twinkle always, Or merely while its newness gilds the toy? The gloss of my last fairing faded soon: A month it shone, and blackened in a year. Must this most gorgeous tremble of tinted stars Melt, like a rocket's crimson burning tears Spilt out o'er purple space and found no more? CONRAD These rays will last a thousand years, and laugh As merrily as ever. VIOLET Wonderful! You mean it? Then I fear this trinket cost More than a golden ducat. CONRAD More than one, And more, I should not wonder, than a thousand Tacked to its golden heels. VIOLET Nay, do not mock me: 'Tis a fair gift, and thus I pay thank's toll, Once and again. The morning we are wedded I'll wear a pure white gown, at bosom these, Lent-lilies twisted crown-wise on my curls, And in my girdle staring pansy-tufts. God give me beauty for that morn at least, For it were pity if, of all my days, I should be found mis-featured on this one, And shame my lord with foulness as his bride— Suppose I hoard thy necklace up till then, Closed in a crafty cupboard. CONRAD Wear it rather At once, in this good wreath of blooming present; For the strange years turn strangely, and God knows, Who shall be wife, and who shall husband her. It is a child's device to hoard aside The sweetest morsel on the trencher's edge, And taste it last of all. 'Tis childhood's heart Alone believes Time trusty and secure. Our wiser years have proved him false and haggard, Thrusting the promised good from many doors, And ringing joy-bells backwards!—Do you love me? VIOLET God knows my life is but a darkened moon, Lit only on that side which turns itself After thy presence! CONRAD As a child you love me: But wenches' love is light and soon foredone, Fills with the moon, then ebbs with her away, In a white tidal fancy. This is maidenish Liking: but woman's love is thewed, and bears Such clinging clutch of pertinacious arms, That not the rudest brand of burning harm Will e'er unrivet them. VIOLET Whence should this come? There is no one to harm me but yourself. Can Love divide his kingdom, kiss at noon And ere the dew-fall slay? CONRAD There are two loves: One is a viper love with viper poison, Which, as a toad does when you look at him, Swells up in spite. One love is wholly lamb-like, Fleeced in soft down, healing and giving comfort, Kissing the tears of time. VIOLET Be mine the last. CONRAD And you the white lamb in a good green field, Whom we may fondle, and tie round its ears With cherry bows. Will it come in a string To the city with its master? VIOLET It will shame thee Before the great and lovely ladies there. CONRAD Nay, though a ring of frowning queens gloomed scorn, I would uphold you flower of all their herd. Child, I have done with queens—'tis a hard breed— Great sweeping damsels of the court, farewell! I heed no gracious ladies, saving one, Who is perfected grace. The rest are scum, Mere tinselled bulks of insincerity; Yet some of their great eyes can look right through you, And some of their deep sighs are soft and dangerous, And, when you go, they make you understand That they are wonderfully sad to lose you!— There is more truth in your least finger end Than in a palace-full of painted nymphs, Whose threadbare artificialities Would make Job in his potsherds yawning-angry. VIOLET Ah, these high dames will hate and gibe at me, And spread their many rainbow-coloured wiles To shame my simple whiteness. They will sneer, Was ever knight so simple? she is nothing: He takes his reckling of the meadow geese For a most crystal heaven-expanded swan; And her poor cackle for the royal notes, Which, like some mighty poet of the cloud, This lily of birds dies singing. CONRAD We can love Without their kindness or assenting brows. For fools disparage, ay, and fiends deride The pearls of Heaven; while Satan's choicest gold Is cankered brass to God. VIOLET O, sweetheart, bide For ever in these woodlands of my childhood; Best are they, after all. For these green twigs Have never learnt ambition: the rose trail Grows without envy of the eglantere: All things are happy. Why should you return? Your knighthood—O, forget to be a knight: The wars are rough and full of useless blood. The limits of the kingdoms never move, Though their graves thicken like a molehill field; While the poor weary kings sit wrapt in fear Or buffet down each other—Stay— CONRAD I dare not; But if I might unclasp these blistering greaves, Unlatch this morion eating into my brow, Uncoat this grinding mail of golden care;— Could I peel off my greatness at your word, And be some woodland fellow cutting twigs And chopping bavins—so you partnered me, And raked the ashes up in our dull home, When the owl's star crept out and called the moon, And loosed their sweating collars off the beeves;— If up the valley, in our doorway, white, Large-eyed and tender, arming on your heart Our yearling child, I saw you watching, heard The music of the mother bird, because Its mate came homewards, sailing through the pines— I swear by those red garden tears of Christ, Which this dropped resin on the fir's side likens— That I would dash aside, detestable, These trappings of my life, that gall me down With heavy splendour. I would pluck in twain The indentures of that cursed regality, Which rivets me with devil-twisted thongs Apprentice to the prince of this world, whom All princes posture after; I would fling The bitter husks of my detested past To burn in rubbish Tophets with the foul Ordures and scums of the wicked city—Free! Free at the last. Then at your feet, my child, I would weep out my heart in ecstasies, Yours and no other's,—while the kingdoms rot, And the great world rolls hellwards as of old! VIOLET What passion is this, my lover? What strange words Of greatness and repentance? Are you great? I know you are to my humility, A girl of the hedge, whom no one ever heeded Till you did. Great? What river feeds your greatness? What mountain-head your fame? what sea receives them? A shudder ripples right across my heart: Dearest and best, I trust you to the end: Do anything, say anything, I trust you! Why should I waver? If you ceased to love me, My elements would crumble into dust: As a dead form, torn from the shielding tomb, Melts in the full fierce ruin of the light. God made me at my birth: my second god Found and remade me at his coming: none Saw me, till he did, in my wood: he came, And simply kissed me, and my light arose, And the evening and the morning were the day! CONRAD O thou, whose love grows soft around my heart, As silken grass invests the arid down,— Demand no more, but merely love me. This Orbit of love includes within its bend A universe of still beatitudes. Who recks, if—wafted on the reeling air, Which sways behind the current of the gloom, Out in the night there, out beyond our garden's Dew-swarded limits—foul and filmy things Cross and re-cross with bat-like ears and hands, Spectrally screaming? Need we watch them? Nay: Nor lean beyond our flowery island's brink To catch the hideous sawing of their wings. Turn rather inwards, where the excess of summer Tangles our garden to so many bowers, We know not round which thicket nectar-yielding We best can play with love at hide and seek! VIOLET This flitter-mouse, which sails the darkened skirts Beyond the roses of our paradise, Is then some secret, which I may not fathom: Well, shroud it up: so potently I trust, That I would wed you here with bandaged eyes, And penetrate the chasm and void hereafter, My hand inside your hand, my eddying hair Brushing your neighboured shoulder, as we go. Veil what you will, unveil what pleases you, I will not vex you with a single ‘why?’ Let this bird-beast of gloom soar round our bowers, And scrape my nuptial lattice with its wing,— Shall I desire to scan it closer? Nay— And yet strange inspiration plucks at me— I seem to hear God speaking in my heart,— Why should our wedding wait another hour, If there is danger in the air against it, And God hath sent its incidents? Behold! (pointing) Are not his feet fair on the crags of time, Who, bearing in his ignorant good hands, Love's final consecration, comes? CONRAD Ah, child, You know not what you ask or what you say ... How can I wed you in this waste of trees ... Where is the book, the priest, the church, the ring? VIOLET I speak inspired: my mother's ring is here, The chapel here, yonder a holy man, Reading his missal, climbs the mountain road. Hath not God spoken in his sending? CONRAD Ay: He comes in strangely pat. But, whence commissioned, I care not to demand. VIOLET But I know best: For up in gracious heaven some rainbow spirit, Belike my mother's angel, silver-eyed And filmy-feathered, winnows to the throne, And tells the story of our loves to Him, The mighty cone of light, black at its core, At whose feet sit the four archangels watching. And the light says—‘So be it!’ And one goes Winging away, like a twanged shaft, in heaven, And touches earth ere one can say ‘He is gone!’ And, earthward lit, seeks out an old grey saint, Who sits at even in a field, whose shoulder He taps, whose ear he whispers. Up the saint Arises, takes his staff, and, lo! is here— Whom I will summon. (raising her voice.) O good ghostly father, Who scalest these rough hills, pilgrim of Christ, As once thy master climbed up Calvary— Pause on thy sacred errand, here turn in Through this arch ruined once a holy place; And, though the altar splits with wilding flowers, God's children, these cannot unconsecrate This precinct of divinity, these walls Made holy with the echoes in dead years Of million supplications. Who shall say, That this is not the table of God's rites, Although the oat-grass and the bryony vine Supplant the elements? O, enter priest, We need thy office. PRIEST Do not hold me long. Northwards I toil, hot speed devours my heart; But my most frail and unresponsive limbs Fail me; as one who goes in shifting sand, The devil hangs a lead weight on each leg To hold me back from those poor dying souls, Who yearn for shrift. Girl, girl, let me be gone! Is this a time for love and meeting mouths? Have ye not heard the blue plague is unleashed Among the Saxon? and the uncarted dead Lie spotted in the sunny market-places, And clog the conduits of the lonely streets. It seems a city of one vast repose, With all men strangely sleeping on their backs In the open, drunk with death; who twists their eyes With the strange glazing of his cup supreme, To which the drink drawn at our mother's teat Was the first drop to lead us—In that town, I tell thee, that the sextons all are dead And the priests all are dying,—and I go! Oh, for the wings of eagles: but I crawl, And creep, and stumble. (To Violet) Ah, fair rose-bud face, So full of joy, the Lord is at the doors, Dash down thy wreath: He smiteth: let Him in. O fairy cheek, the plague-worm may crawl out Upon it from the marriage-garland! come, Since I must wed you, come; brief is my time. Give me thy hand, O maiden: and thou, the groom, Whose face is mantled so with ivy-shade, Stand forth and give me thine. CONRAD (aside, coming forward reluctantly) Well—Be it so! I never sought this mocking rite: some fiend Pushes it at me. Let the lie proceed. She will be purer thinking she is wed, And I not so much blacker. (Aloud) Priest read on. PRIEST (about to join their hands) Wilt have this maid to wife? CONRAD I surely will. PRIEST I join your hands (recognises Conrad). By Heaven, I sever them (flings their hands roughly apart). O execrable tyrant, I discern The cloven hoof of thy oppressions here! Ah, my poor maiden, flee this satyr King, Whom I will curse with thunder straight from Heaven; And God will give my mouth sufficient peal, And wing with levin brands my imprecation, While I repay the mock this crowned dishonour Would heap upon the sacrament of God— Tyrant, seducer, perish in thy sin: Let an eternal doom of worm and fire Be meted to thy bosom. Death, sin's wages, Death, death be thine! A death without death's comfort, And, till it come, a life without life's joy: I do award thee both. My tongue is God's. Could'st thou not have thy lusts aloof from Him, Must cheat Him to come down through holy hands To smear a consecration o'er thy sin? Therefore, I say, seethe in the sulphur brinks, And turn upon a wheel in hell for this! Be Herod's end, here and hereafter, thine: Let the uncoiling worm, who gnaws the grave, Feed sweetly on thy filthy fibrous heart For making Holy Church the procuress, King, of thy lust: Amen! CONRAD Well mouthed, by Mars: Rome's rusty shotless cannon-throat peals well! Boys hit with elder pop-guns quite as hard. Rot, scolding priest! My sword tastes only men, Not railing epicenes in petticoats, Who patter prayers at profit by the ell. Off! while you breathe— [Priest raises his hands and exit sadly. VIOLET (dreamily) Alas, he has gone mad! CONRAD Why, so he has my darling, and so have I; (drawing her towards him.) Come, you will kiss me still. These birds build nests Without a priest to teach them pack the straws. VIOLET But he said—King! CONRAD And I say, Queen of Flowers, And love and bloomy kisses. In whose mouth The ether of a wilderness of summers Drugs nature with delirium; in its fire The strong hills quiver like a paper sheet, And the large clouds reel as a weanling's limbs— Ah—can you love me still? VIOLET Alas, alas, I weep to think how much. Can the white sea, Trembling through all her furrows, sheeting out The silver edges of her soft swift fear, Help loving that strong golden tyrant storm, That almost crushes her with ecstasy .... But he said—King. CONRAD Sweet, if you love me much, He has said well: if little, then suppose him Merely a madman still. VIOLET Merciful God, It breaks—It breaks! Heaven save and succour all— You must be King then? CONRAD Ay, so poor a name; But dowered beyond all other emperors In thy rich love. VIOLET Help me—The world grows dark— King—King—my King! CONRAD Catch up my mouth with kisses, And leave the rest. VIOLET But let me speak— CONRAD Say nothing! Let cold to-morrow tell its want in words, For here the angels are and silence here: As the great heaven's most inward nest of stillness Unfolded, world o'er world, and sphere on sphere, Full of great beating stars, and palpitating Light points beyond them, on and always on— Star roads, rose veils, and galleries of ether! VIOLET O, my King, spare me!— CONRAD Do you love me now, Or hate me, Violet? VIOLET O King, O love, My first love and my last love, though I die; I weep, and weep, and weep to see my sin In daring not to abhor you as I ought, In daring yet to love you as I must; Who loathe your trespass, plainly see you stained With the red leavings of Sin's giant cup; Dead I should drop and senseless, if I dared Think out your baseness. O my spirit's master, Lord of my soul, sweet-base, yet basely dear: False and belovèd, false!—I blame you none. Push me inside a cloister: let me rot: My day is done—Go back to your great Queen— I have kissed you and I love you: 'tis enough. I am ready for my grave! ACT IV. SCENE I. Ten months are supposed to have elapsed. A street in the capital city. A Courtier and a Count meeting. COURTIER Has heard the news? COUNT I have dimly and brokenly received some filtration of tidings. The trumpet twang of rumour is thick with startling yet uncertain echoes. COURTIER This Rumour is an ignorant jade; I have all upon gospel certitude. I move within the golden orbits; and can, therefore, speak like an almanack. COUNT Then let me anatomize in the noonday perspicacity of thy intelligence the how, where, and when— the depth, length, and amplitude of this most delectable calumny. But, imprimis, doth this surely hold, that there is a new tax upon thirst, both bottled and barrelled, ere it passes the barrier? COURTIER Most assuredly. These tidings are frayed and already thread-bare. COUNT And this toll treads into the heel of that recent impost upon eggs and butter? COURTIER Excellency, why not? 'Tis merely another wrench round of the national cheese-press. These things must so soon become palpable to the pocket, that it is superfluous to present them to the ear. Your human atomy is most sensitive in his purse-strings. The ear dulls, the hand numbs, the heart is clouded, but your pocket is perpetually alert. Now let us be logical, and take things in their natural order. Hereby, we shall learn, that these young sucking taxes are mere feeders and sustentations of the new archtax, as recently by royal whim established; to wit, a fair and frail national Hydra with many arms, and, for the instant, unlimited credit. It is confidently predicted, that she must, within certain moons, suck, drain, exhaust, and desiccate State, Church, King, Commons and revenues, into a kind of pulpy pabulum necessary to the existence of this especial and peculiar maiden-handed polypus. COUNT Grows it then to this? How gat he within sail-reach of this wind-mill? This Conrad of ours was ever rather bloody-minded than lecherous. Granting, that these two attributes should usually be cousin-germans, he at least excelled in the predominance of the butcher. COURTIER There it precisely was. In recruiting himself after the practice of one virtue, head-cropping; he runs me his nose into the opposite virtue of wenching. A certain bibulosity of a count, one tun-barrel on leg-stalks, to wit, our late Gemmingen, and certain his pot-companions, need the quietude ensued by separation of their neck-joints. So said, so done; Conrad has earned his holiday and goes a hunting with a good conscience. He must needs try his seventh forest, of lean repute for game. Here, he gets separated from his train through the agency of sudden-dropping darkness and most villainous weather. Hence, more like a drowned rat than a most Christian monarch, he stumbles into a certain tumble-down wood-lodge; wherein abides the newest incarnation of Dan Cupid his deceptitudes, in the shape of a certain pink and white kitten, hardly beyond the nursery, of most dangerous innocency and most beguiling ignorance. The most Christian potentate likes his quarters well, sees no necessity of moving, and omits all tidings of his whereabouts. For three whole days this kingdom resembles a master who has lost his dog. In fact, Her Majesty metaphorically did send round our news-monger and town-crier—to wit, Rumour the aforesaid—with some such proclamation: —‘Strayed out upon immensity—one of Jove's own vice-regents. Can the lamps of space, or the abysses of the profound, proclaim this monarch's whereabouts to his tearful people and sorrowing consort?’ COUNT And that brought up another revolt? I seem now to recall the circumstance; but it was a mere flea-bite of an insurrection. They sacked, methinks, a silver-smith's shop, and hung three bakers. The reason was—the rider missing; though many of the outward vulgar could not guess, why the body politic had begun to rear. I mind me, that then my apricots were barely ripe upon one cheek. COURTIER Sir, you are accurate; the very time. I warrant you, that we of the fringe of royalty had a sufficient handful in pacifying her distracted majesty. Where was the King? In any place but the right one. Would he come back? Most inevitably; as does Phœbus from inter-solar darkness. Why send no messenger? All hands were needed to bear his game home. The people were up, what should she do? Hang a liberal half-dozen. All which duly came to pass; when, look you, at the tag end of the week in sedately walks our missing Emperor; asks for his letters, kisses his wife, and observes, he has been detained! She, poor thing, glad to have him back at any cost, dutifully presses no further, but tearfully mentions the outbreak. Whereon, Conrad swears a spacious oath and orders his horse round. At whose appearance in the streets, the rioters, who had elected him unanimously to heaven, disappear, head first, into rat-holes and drain-pipes. Therefore, examples being necessary, a few folk, quiet and worthy, whose innocency lent no quicksilver to their heels, are caught, suspended, and the affair drops. Time elapses, sun and moon play their old game of leap-frog. Days unroll nothing of consequence. Conrad for a season acquiesces in domesticity, and fairly buckles to national affairs. The wild girl of the woods is, for the moment, shelved and cupboarded. Conrad attends mass with the Queen on Sundays, devises a new dress for his halberdiers, grants the guild of pork-butchers a fresh charter, regulates with the Archbishop the discipline of the minor clergy; and is once more a monarch among ten millions. COUNT Yet, if I mistake not, just in the thick of damson-harvest he once more gave slip to the proprieties. My trees have this year suffered with a kind of evil and grievous worm—but that regards not one who abides in the fan-light of regality. I am apt to reckon state events by garden incidents. Your urbanity will smile at, but excuse my simple computation. It is safer to manure cabbages than to cultivate the political sciences. Therefore, I live somewhat retired, after the manner of sundry classical worthies; hoping in such seclusion to keep my eyes above my neck until my two male brats be strong enough to fend without me. COURTIER Your excellency is a worthy man. For myself, lizard-like, I prefer glare to shade, even at the risk of damsel Fortune noosing me with a ring of horse-hair. COUNT I am beholden for your good opinion. But where were we? Ah, on Conrad's relapse into woodman's ways. Now depose, I pray you, as my ears are of the safest, by what signs or portents was this second exodus of our most royal preceded? COURTIER Hark in your auricle—I had this direct from the palace porter; but—go to—you will say, ‘Fables,’ and indeed the whole matter transcends credibility. COUNT Proceed—Proceed—My ear waters with expectation. COURTIER Thus then—Get ready all your amazement. One sundown a dusty peasant boy halts himself at the grand entrance of our palace. ‘Get you gone,’ quoth our porter, ‘your rags and scent offend me.’ But the boy goes not. ‘Whom seek you?’ yawns Cerberus, after the fluxion of an hour or so. ‘Your master,’ replies the imp, reseating himself with a resolute patience on a dust-heap. ‘Imp, you lie, I have no master but Cæsar.’ ‘Porter, you lie, for to Cæsar is my message.’ COUNT Stupendous! COURTIER Thereon, the porter claps me his hands upon his ribs, and laughs aloud sans interruption for a space of fifteen calendar minutes. ‘Is your message a long one?’ gasped the porter, when laughter allowed him utterance. ‘Say unto your king—Ghost,’ returned the boy, and incontinently sat him down again. ‘This youth is mad,’ said the porter, and to bed he went. But in the morning our boy was there always. At noon must the king ride forth with a retinue. No sooner are gates unhinged than the brat leaps out into the very midmost roadway at Conrad his horse's nostril. The King is nearly over him, and jerks up his charger smartly. ‘Ghost, O King!’ shrieks the boy from under the horse-shoes, and again, ‘Ghost!’ then, shaking himself together, away for his life scours this urchin. Forward comes the porter penitently, for somewhat in Conrad's eye-corner abated his merriment. ‘This is a mad boy, your majesty: these twelve hours gone, have I with difficulty restrained him at bay from annoying your exaltitude.’ ‘Did you so?’ quoth Conrad, grimly, ‘As I hope for salvation, I did,’ faltered the porter. ‘So,’ said the King, ‘strap this beef-witted knave to an elm-plank, and give him twenty lashes with the knottiest cow-hide whip in my dominions.’ Then, turning to his train, ‘Gentlemen, our ride for this morning must stand over.’ And with a grunt he reels round his horse back into the palace. That night again was our King off into space! COUNT These things are prodigious. That a king now should come at the call of an errand-boy! Human belief can barely embosom such a calamitous paradox. Yet in these times one may expect strange events. I found no less than fifty-seven beetles in the act of kind on one cucumber bed yesterday after a violent rain-drench; and, on Thursday fortnight, I by misadventure tore up a mandrake instead of a horse-radish. These things are surely ominous. COURTIER Your excellency is ever penetrant. COUNT I am to surmise, then, that this second vanishing of our anointed put the pale queen into some suspicion that her husband's venison went upon two feet. COURTIER Your mother-wit has surfaced well her Highness's suspicions; it remains to my humility to turn, as under a lamp, your lordship's eyes upon the special tissue and texture of this mystery— COUNT I am fortunate in my instructor. COURTIER I kiss your Countship's hand—Can your acute mind unreel some six years of rope off Time's wind-lass? Can you recall a certain misbegotten churl, whom devils now name Raban, but fortunately in an earthly sense at the present year of grace dust and cinders? COUNT Can I not? I see the eft at this moment in my brain-pan, as lucidly as yonder water-spout. He was a bunch mostly head like a cuttle-fish. None could predict from what point in his anatomy limb-protrusion might ensue. His malice equalled his deformity. He was concerned (was he not?) in our late king's— COURTIER (hurriedly) Sudden illness and precipitately unkind withdrawal. Had not this aged monarch somewhat exceeded the limit of humanity, our sorrowing land would to this day have worn mufflers. COUNT Sir, I apprehend you! The wise mouth blabs not in thoroughfares. But how comes this dead dog Raban into this live royal—Hem! difficulty? COURTIER When about to be strangulated, he must needs vent on his last breath a prophecy. This he despatches with his duty to her Highness; videlicet— that one, who broke friendly compact, would also snap fetter conjugal. Meaning, that Conrad, who would incontinently choke him, would incontinently cheat her. COUNT These abortions of humanity are often lynx-sighted; a feature which they share with idiots, epileptics, albinos, embryos, homuncules, and other hermaphrodites. As for Raban, he was haltered with a general hand-clapping. No popular tear moistened his rope. Yet, whisper goes, Conrad owed him a golden chair and a second-hand scarlet wrapper. If so, was not this extinction in a measure ungrateful? COURTIER Not a whit, sir, not a whit. In this dismissal was Adelheid prime mover. Conrad had hint of something stirring, wisely took a walk, eyelids down, and hands clapped to his ear-holes. Besides, Conrad lacked the patient audacity to snap, at fitting season, the gin of silence upon his quondam accomplice. Conrad's bravery is merely bull-like, and rushes. Adelheid's courage is feline, and waits. Raban had lived—the devil rend him—until now, had Conrad been his only executioner. Let us also note, that during Raban's survival, Adelheid's influence with Conrad was merely second-best. This to a wife is torture and ignominy. Then she owed this same crab-monkey,—how shall we phrase it?—orphanhood. Consider now by analogy their respective attitudes: My children kept a cat and a bird. Such pets are incompatible. It was merely an affair of time. Puss watches and watches again. One day the cage-door is left open. No more song and a flutter of feathers! COUNT I now apprehend your digression to this Raban. I see, that of this forth-coming Siren he was indirectly prophetic. Good! Now as to the creature herself: remains she in her woods? How is she parented? Why these taxes? What does the Queen say? Excuse my quaternion of queries, but curiosity aroused strings questions like larks for the game market. COURTIER Your excellency shall be satisfied. Your why last spoken first pricks memory. ‘What will the Queen say?’ Marry, she hath said on the testimony of her most intimate—nothing; or the merest ghosts and shadows of sentences. Yet hath she looked a whole sky-full of thunder; and hath sown (they tell me) quite enough seed of tears to reap a whole field of armoured resolutions. COUNT Nay, I rather see the dragon teeth in our taxes than in her tears. COURTIER An' please you, in the present conjuncture imposts are inevitable. Royal mistresses sprout taxes as rotten rails do fungus. Lo, I will now grasp two of your questions in one sheaf. Taxes and residence. Residence imprimis. Inasmuch as Conrad had raised this Violetta von Minden to the honourable and well-precedented estate of royal concubinage, and established her therein, he must needs cast about in what quarter to dispose of her. With the Queen in her present mood it would imply peril inevitable, for him to be jogging off wood-wards for whole nights together. Leave a jealous woman to herself, and she will always find tow and torches, resin and saltpetre, faggots, high wind, and a huge mind for a bonfire. Therefore, must Conrad bide at home, and sit in person upon the bungs of his domestic tar-barrels. But, inasmuch as two Lunas may not occupy the same sweep of spangled midnight, to the actual palace cannot this Violetta be—purveyed. Though there is precedent in our annals for such an arrangement; yet no precedent for a queen of such tinder and touch-paper surface as our present governess. In this dilemma or dubiety, Conrad, extravagant in the double right of king and lover, is about to edify out of hand a palace in duplicate. Had this scheme held, our very hides had gone to satisfy the collectors of revenue. But that cloud carried off its rain drily. Luckily, an old summer-palace, just outside the north wall, is remembered. Conrad gave the word Furbish; and to it they went with a will, masons, hodmen, carpenters, joiners, carvers, gilders, tapestry-mongers, and, not to weary your excellency, the whole tribe of such as minister to the lust of the eye and the pride of life. Presently, when the setting is ready, the jewel is sent for and framed. Our archbishop, with infinite tact, tenders his respects in person on the day after Violetta's arrival. She is said to have been greatly re-assured by this ghostly recognition. Our primate is a wary man and a dexterous, keen-nosed and weather-wise. He continually ascends the roof of Holy Church to scent the direction of the aerial currents. Some call him a trimmer and her a Jezebel. But I weary you. Suffice it to say, there she is; and there—for the present—she is likely to continue. COUNT For the present—Hem! Poor little sparrow: the hen-eagle will pick her bones clean—some day. COURTIER Indeed, sir, you be mistaken. This Adelheid's day is done: her turn is served. Conrad never but passably loved her. She was his ladder to splendour. Now, he is in at the window, master of the front door, and his old scaling-tackle may rot. Let Adelheid mutter and mow; Conrad has set his nose as a mule, and means to push on by his own roads and no other. If this queen be worldly-wise, let her make as though she saw not. Then, if the new star be not rancorous, Adelheid may continue to enjoy apart a kind of desolated grandeur; but let not her tongue wag in blasphemy against the newly elect, or I will nowise answer for her continuing to see daylight. COUNT And now, lastly, the favourite's origin? Von Minden, if I caught rightly the smack of your lips. It sounds, somehow, familiar and yet unfamiliar. My memory cannot piece the thread of it. Let me see— Let me see—Von Minden, Minden? COURTIER The original text of this fair transcript of Mother Eve was one certain out-at-elbow Baron, poor as a mole, lean as a greyhound. He intermarried with some rag of a feminine cousin, and begat one child to the national detriment. He goes to the wars, of course, as a trade less dangerous than the inevitable starvation of his own fireside; he serves under Conrad, then Captain of the Forces, here and there, without eminence and without ignominy, in the rank and ruck of Mars his myrmidons; until in the tussle at Arnheim someone pushes a spear through his tissues, and so finis! His orphan lives intermediately on goat-milk and fir-cones, unconscious of higher destinies; until— a rap at the door in the forest, and enter Conrad! COUNT I do not seem to remember this soldier. COURTIER Your excellency will excuse me—but, at this distance of time, with the man underground these ten years, you might safely arrogate an acquaintanceship without troubling memory at all in the matter. COUNT There is much in what you say. My remembrance is ever treacherous. One greeted me in the street yesternight, whom I could not name. Clearly, I may have known this Von Minden; I will go and tender my duty at once to the daughter of—my old comrade. COURTIER So will you prove your prudence. Yet, in our private capacities, we shall retain a certain show of honest indignation. At home, sir, the Queen's wrongs are a healthy topic: wives must be impressed! COUNT Fare you well, fare you well! [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A parterre before the Palace. In the background a fountain and flower-beds. Various statues alternated with orange trees in avenues along the walks. Conrad, Adelheid, Letalda, and several tire-women. ADELHEID Give me thy hand. CONRAD I give it. ADELHEID Bring thine eyes Full upon mine. CONRAD I bring them: and what next? Some foolish show is toward. ADELHEID Now King, now husband, As thy soul means to envisage God, the judge, When it has burst its bulging coffin bars, And sailed a poor thin ghost to meet that eye, Which will dissect all passion and all sin; And, like a prism, in the seeming pure Transpicuous beam of each weak human heart Sort out its blue of malice, green of guile, Its bloodshed red, its yellow jealousies, So must thy soul lie naked in His eye. By which anticipation I adjure thee, As thou, poor moth, then hopest to flutter past The reeking candles of the red profound With unsinged wings—By love, by light, by honour, By wine of blood and flesh of holy bread,— By the last fibre of my breaking heart,— Why dost thou shame me with this harlot girl? CONRAD I shame thee none. Are these things for the air? Silence; go in. Closed doors become such speech. ADELHEID Thou shamest me, and in a bitter sort. CONRAD Then send these girls away, and have it out: If we must reason over this, why well! In God's name, say thy say and get it done. But silence here is wiser than a word. ADELHEID I fear thee: let them bide. My shame is wrought In such an open way, that all thy realm Rings with it, as a chime of steeple bells. CONRAD I fear you none; yet would I condescend, For quiet life and what your station craves, To hint, there is a subject, queen and madam, Which you and I had better, once for all, Determine, that it shall be locked and closed, Between us, when we meet, as meet we must, Though seldom as you please. Try to forget One theme, and all between us may be well. ADELHEID Remove that noisy fountain's weary drip, And, when 'tis gone, thou shalt with ease forget it. But while it splashes on at elbow here, With opalescent hail and thudding wave-drift, Its teasing echo keeps its thought alive. Canst thou forget a tooth-ache till the fang Be wrenched away? canst thou forget a hunger Till meat be come? So, if this hireling wench Were strangled, I would let this theme lie fallow, Not earlier; and, till that desired event, I'll seed and seed it yet with crop of vengeance! CONRAD Ha! ADELHEID That I will. CONRAD He wins, who plays the last. ADELHEID Dost threat me? CONRAD Take it, madam, as you please. Now, get indoors; for you have been the bellman Of what a modest woman scarce would speak With bated breath within a cloistered grate. 'Tis very well: I shall remember this. Kings treasure long a sense of shame endured: As python saves his poison till the time Comes for his fang to fix: then woe the prey! ADELHEID If you do kill me, I shall take it kindly— (Turning to Letalda) I must die soon. God knows that well. Letalda, You'll seek me out a little homely grave, No marble mausoleum in whose sides Rest queenly ashes. I, discrowned in life, Will make a humble bed with daisy thatched, A grass-grown earth-place near some village turret, In a bye-way of my realm, secludedly Shrouded; which she, this light-love wanton snake, May ne'er bring footfall near, or desecrate With her triumphant laughter. Anywhere Will do, so it be quiet and hidden well. I want no name put over me: just say, ‘A mother and a wife.’ You will see it done, Ay, you are leal, you will. LETALDA Ah, Queen, my tears Rush in reply. They have wrenched all words away. ADELHEID My feet are weary with the hills of time: I am going out of tear-reach and of love-reach. I think this lord of mine, who ought to weep, Will hardly cram his smiles behind his lips, When they come saying, ‘She is dead.’ His eyes Will glisten quietly. He will make shift To sigh a shallow once; demurely teasing Downwards the merry corners of his mouth; And then give word with ostentatious gloom— ‘My folk, let her be decently interred; And for a month must all my varlets wear Black ribbon-tags at shoulder and at knee; For truly, gentlemen, the case is piteous; But at the last her life so sorely irked her, We must not wish her back, and Providence Is wise—Bring round my horse, this chance has dashed me Somewhat; unless I gallop in the air An hour or so, ere supper, I may play But poorly with my trencher’—Conrad, Conrad, I served you as a God: I served you more Than ever loving woman in the world Gave servitude to love, wearing away The very fibre of her life in serving. All this I did rewardless. Highest duty Spurns all reward, and laughs at recompense. Wages pollute its pure and lofty name. You loved me in return a few years—well! Well, for a man I mean. Their love is flimsy, And shallow at its best. I had some beauty, To hold you in the young and vernal years After the love-torch and the orange-wreath. But my great office with its scathing glare Burnt age into my heart, and swiftly wrinkled A brow, where slumber's eyelid seldom closed: Then motherhood arrived, and brought in train Sweet nursing sorrows. These sowed grey among My roses. These bedim the lustrous eye, These thin the plenteous ringlet. Thus I faded; And gave your child the bloom and gloss of all My youth. Right joyfully I gave it him. And so you watched me alter as a leaf, And scanned me with a cold and curious eye, Growing less beautiful; as this my baby Throve on my life; and so I lost, I lost you! Now, therefore, let me die. CONRAD Dying and dying! What dismal iteration sour is this To peal out in a happy garden, scented With rose incense? You jar against the golden Music of yonder eddying nightingale. Your robes mislike the summer in this spot. Can this dishevelled railer be a queen? No lady should forget, however wronged, To be majestic in her injuries. A queen through all her woes should queen it still. The stress of your invective overturns All modest self-reserve, all decencies Which even dying women guard. Get home. Rave, if you must, indoors among your girls. Here you disgrace my kingdom and myself: Upon your duty as a spouse, begone! ADELHEID Patient and meek, my women, let us be— O but hear him, this perjury, my husband, Who keeps his word so well, who saves so clean The mirror of his nice untarnished honour,— How he, the pattern and the flower of spouses, Is good enough to read me full of flaws: In what? My God! In wifely duty towards him! He hath such utter right to censure here, He might as well set climax to his blame, And build perfection on his insult up, By bringing here his harlot paragon To preach me homilies on continence, And teach me how to walk with modest feet: By summoning this abject girl to scold And finger out my fault. Can shame, the swine, Roll in a redder ditch, bemire its sides With smokier reek, than, when a lordly man, Heroic once, degrades his lustrous name To soil with such a love? O let her come! And, if the mistress through the husband's lips Admonishes the wife, finds her impure, And this and that, and poisons all his mind— Let us excuse her: we are worlds apart. You might as well instruct the rushlight glow-worm To lift its lamp and comprehend the moon; Or teach some butterfly with bannered wing What thoughts burn in the mother eagle's brain, Whirling around the sun. This trifler know me, This insect see the deeps between my waves? Never, ah; God. Our paths are twain. I brush The stormy stars: her wings are wet with dew Gleaned on a cabbage face. My pinions mount And moisten in the heart of thunder clouds. How can she sound my grief or gauge my joy? This stall-fed heifer, with her shining hide And hard impervious heart, which quickens only At sensual promptings or the lash of fear. Poor painted rubbish, call her as you will, Disguise her traffic in complacent phrase: Give her the roll of sugared epithets To revel through—one name she cannot clutch— Wife! Round this name my dying fingers tighten; O save it from her, God, when I am cold! CONRAD Save all your imprecations; they but weary The summer airs, which serve them for a raft. I heed you less than yonder scolding jay. You want a slave, my Queen, and not a husband; A broken and a contrite mock of manhood. I think, you wish to lead me up and down With eyes demure, tied to your apron string; And, if a damsel pass, my glance must know No wandering save upon my gracious lady. By Vulcan, but I think the market-wives Would crack their kirtled sides, on basket-seats Laughing, to see a King so meanly led. ADELHEID My daily meat is insult. Sir, I think Your very kennel hounds are better fed And more considered than I be. Remember, You did not pick me up to mate with you Out of some faggot-chopper's hut; remember, I am the daughter of this kingdom's kings: The earth itself we stand upon is mine, Mine yonder chain of mountains, mine that palace; And even those poor hinds, who fathered you, Were but my father's villain-slaves to hoe His yard, and cart the rubbish of his kitchens:— King, you may be, by my allowance King, And by your own ingratitude my tyrant: My master and my queller, how began you? There was a common captain, whom my hand Plucked from the gutter of his servitude To bench on gold beside me.—You forget, My father's servant, how I gave you all— And to my cost I gave it—diadem, This orb and sceptred state. Can you uplift A brazen forehead and a tongue of insult Beneath such crushing congregated crags Of obligation, as this gift enormous Involves upon your mean humility? CONRAD Wrench not the truth to sharp your malice sting. Your every sentence staggers with a load Of virulent perversion. So it was not, And never could have been. Take back your tale Amended: hear the right: and perish slander! O'er his own ears your father drew his shroud: His daughter should be wiser. That wild night, That ruined him, crowned me. By merit crowned me. Because our army conquered with my word, But under others wavered or withdrew. So sheer desert won me my golden place; My crowning went before, not came behind Our marriage. Did one soldier say, ‘Rule us, Because you mean to wed this Adelheid, Child of the stark and stricken tyrant there?’ By God in ether, nay: this much you gave me— And hug yourself thereon—your bloodright tightened The preadjusted circlet on my hair. Nearness in blood is naught—be witness Uriel— If yoked with feeble head—His royal vein Found him and left him—toper. More than all, You were unsexed from throning it alone: The loaf your father left you, hard at rind, Needed a sword to cleave it: this was I. You had to share your diadem with some one: The neighbour princelings seemed by Conrad's side— As then you held him—worms. Your other captains As wrens before your eagle. So you chose; And wisely, though I say it, fell your choice. You gave your whiteness to my arms, you gave me Withal the rough possession of a realm, Which a girl's fairy hand and minion fingers Were weak as sand to strain or grapple down. ADELHEID Husband, I will not wrangle any more, If I be first or last; if once my hand Had crowns to give away: that is well over. I am trod down beneath your wrong as grass, And never shall I straighten up my stem For any verdure more. What profit then For one so bruised to boast what she has been? All are unroyal in the grave. Ah, Conrad, They say, that dying folk have oft strange whims, And I am grown fantastic near my end; Suppose—nay, you will laugh—I say, suppose, You were to come some night, and made believe, As in the old days, that you loved me still: Came in and sat beside me, and pretended, And talked a little kindly, nursed the child A bit, and told me he was fair and rosy, That in his dimples your old smile you caught. O try, and humour my poor brainsick fancy To such a pitch of fooling! I believe, That I could almost bear my onward life, For the child's sake, if you would drape your hatred To come in lover's raiment twice or once. O Conrad, grant my whim! You shake your locks, And round the sullen corners of your mouth A scornful sneer begins. I know, I know This faded hair, these dismal leaden lips, These haggard cheeks, this homely-featured face, Make me the strangest suitor on this earth To wait outside the palace courts of Love In the chill withering rain-blast of rejection. That I was ever wholly beautiful, I do not think. Girlhood and gladness gave A certain charm. Our life has been a bad one: And yet the very prickles on Love's road, Which stung our footfall, sweetened in their sting, Because in welded unison we trod A common pain together. Gentlier went That rough ill-weathered day wherein you loved me, Than this more halcyon time of my neglect; My solitude sighs like a sea-face now, Whereover brood infinite muffled miles Of ocean vapour, through whose monotone Not one gay ship comes sailing. That's my life! But, when you loved me, like a strong white star I went from even until dawning full Of golden hope and clomb the heaven around, One will between us. O we went so firmly. I held your hand upon my hand, and fear Became a laughter. Through the smoke of death, The dragon land, the fiery deeps of blood, I saw one face—my husband's—and went on, As though I felt the daisies at my feet In meadowy valleys under quiet woods. It is my glory to have been your mate, Not idle, but another living brain Building your throne beside you: night and day, In rumours of conspiracy, in hours Of chidden armies, still at your right hand Undaunted: when rebellion, bolt by bolt, Played round our royal heads to tear us down,— Did I quail then, did I seem pitiful? Not so: men said, this queen is steel and fire; But they were wrong, I was all love; naught else; My husband was my law and lawgiver, And righteous any deed that helped him best. I bathed my hands in carnage and was glad; For every stain of blood upon my robes Had seated him securer on his throne, Who was my sun in heaven, my oracle, My breath, my soul, my justice. Hear me now, When the long dark is ready for my feet; Love, husband, master, King, almost my God, In whose dear service my whole life, a slave, Has bent herself adoring. I required Only a little love as my reward; On this my soul was nourished, only on this— Now he despises, scorns, and spits at me: Smiles on that other woman, whom he loves, And clothes her in all glory, once my own; Whereby, I weep all night, and only rise To tears—tears—tears; and I discern no end Save that cold common grave, where I descend. Yet, ere I go forth on my darkened journey, Though I be weak, rejected, without realm, Though here my mandate barely moves a child, While at your nod hosts buckle armour on, And speck the night with torches: though I be Here as an emmet to King Hercules,— Yet my vexed soul, spreading her wings for flight, Shall toss herself upon the void, crying out The direst word, that ever dying wife Sighed forth her soul in saying— CONRAD What wilt say? I fear no breath of speech. I have played too long With danger's solid shape to veil my brows At noise or shadow merely. Say thy say And get it done! ADELHEID I can pray God to curse thee! CONRAD Will that do much? ADELHEID It may, most impious man; The curse of one poor broken woman's heart Is terrible enough to overthrow God's own elect archangel crowned with thunder: And dire enough to make this dædal earth Swim in God's eye a lurid blot of plague Among the lucid orbs that roll below Him, Sowing His deep with stars.—Art answered, fool, What my curse dying does? CONRAD You sprinkle death Largely along the furrows of a sea Of hideous speech: whose wild and wordy surge, With wave-head after wave-head following, stings My mind, as some opposing continent, Whereon its small erosions bite and bite. You wring my ears with dinning, you will die: And in the interim you tease and prick me With your continual needles of reproof; To front a forest-road of maddened gad-flies Is better, by the mass! ADELHEID Dissembler, hear! Hear and beware: you push me to the last Inch on the trembling lip of patience: darkness Is under me. I shall not fall alone. I valueless may grapple in my lapse Inestimable things and ruin them. Ah, you may rue my dying for more reasons Than the mock grief, which at my gainful loss. Will ring out joy-bells in your summer palace. I will drag down more grief: must I speak plainer? As you do hope your babe shall come to man— I charge you, hear me! On his life, on mine— A futile adjuration this poor last:— Yet, that you love the child, I well believe, And that you loathe me, I believe the better: But, though I languish in your hate, allow This infant's love to occupy your heart Without infection of the mother's scorn. Cherish him well: forget he is my child. Forget, that his abandoned mother bore him: Let not her detestation sear his grace. I am content with such oblivion: sooner Your slaves shall teach him, that he never had A mother fit for naming; I will bear That he should scorn me lying in my grave, When he is grown hereafter: let it pass. But one affliction cannot I endure, That your abhorrence of poor broken me, As the infusion of some venomed weed, Should tinge with poison his young cup of days. I then adjure you, greatly love this child; Whatever God does with me, you must love him— Swear—promise this! CONRAD You now adjure me idly. We need no clattering oaths on such a pledge. Of course I love that little baby brow, Which, as continuator of my honour, Shall teach the hereafter how his father sate Here diademed in glory, and hand on Some vestige of his face to frown men down with, When the original is dust and silence— Love I the boy? By Christ on cross, I do! ADELHEID (in a low monotone) Suppose, he died— CONRAD Peace, raven! ADELHEID I have said— Suppose, he died! (A pause. After which her manner changes, and she speaks with vehemence.) Conrad, by Mary's Son, Who sees my bleeding breast—we three are standing, Child, King, and Mother on a red gulf's edge: Back, snatch yourself: back, just in time, snatch me! Let not this harlot for an instant longer Divide our loves! Give the word, I will darken Her swift pernicious eyes, ere that sun goes. You would not miss her after one week's mourning: She is a mirage, merely an enchantment, A song of music in your ears, a charm! O glance aside, and give me for an hour The signet off your middle finger. Conrad, I swear, that you will thank me in a month, For plucking my Tannhäuser from the clutch Of his dream Venus, shameful. Turn your head, Leave me alone an hour; and, I engage, That, as the sea-face cruelly is smooth, Where just the boat has sunk with all its crew, That not one ripple of her slight existence Shall vex you, where she glided gaudy-sailed. (Slowly and impressively.) You shall be King again. What are you now? This carrion's lackey! CONRAD Fell assassin, nay! ADELHEID The epithet is just. I often earned it In your upholding. You are generous To make it now my label. CONRAD Slew you Raban To prop my throne, forsooth, by sawing through The sturdiest of its columns? Or to feed Some woman's grudge? I wonder, which? ADELHEID (whispering) I slew him For neither cause, but—Hearken in your ear— The story is a very curious one, And, somewhat oddly, you require it now; This Raban slew my father—slew my father! Is that enough, or must I deeper probe Down to the core in this good monarch's murder? For they do say—and partly I believe it— That some one egged this wry-necked butcher on, And stood himself and shivered at the door. Who might this be, I wonder? CONRAD (wincing) Like a sparrow You come at any crumb of gossip stale, And hawk along my gutters for your news. Who told you this? ADELHEID My own heart: none beside. Love wears, my Lord, a mantle round his eyes, And I have seen but dimly these ten years; But now thy hatred hath unbound my brows, And in the hideous backward of my days The true relations of events stand out, Their hard bright sequence out-lined full in dawn. When morning lifts, the traveller looks back And sees the features of his nightly road. CONRAD (more propitiatively) I will consider—Something may be done— And yet you ask too much by ells of prayer And fathoms of request for royal honour To grant, or entertain as possible To be hereafter granted. Can I veer From fondness to the fellness of your mood In one swift afternoon's discussion? Nay. Besides—the Countess has my plighted word. ADELHEID A plight unsoldering a foregone betrothal: A promise to crack faith already sworn: O rarely binding these!—If live she must— I cannot see, why she should spoil more air By breathing longer—But, if she must live, Turn back this peasant thing to her rough woods To crunch at acorns with her sister swine! CONRAD (losing all at once his self-control) Hold there! I will not have her beautiful name Torn on your lips. ADELHEID Why, this transcends belief, And passes wonder. Then her very name Is grown so purely chaste, so chastely noble, That I, thy wife, must lack permission hence, As held unworthy, to beatify My lip with mention of this rustic hoiden, Whose taper hell-ward lights thy netted feet. CONRAD Use better words or leave her from your speech. You cannot rail the colour off her roses, Or scold the coral from between her lips. What sullen woman, since the moon was hung To rule the tides of madness, ere endured A penury of shrewing epithets To lash against the beauty of her rival? ADELHEID My foot-stool, not my rival: you are wrong: How can this minion claim equality? Base-natured, born most base, a forest wench, Just shown a sugared corner of the world, Secluded in a baby-house of dreams: This woodman's offset, peasant's paragon, This doll-like puppet, of whose waking hours A king, an idle king, must rock the cradle, A hero sing this mammet fast asleep. O shame, this rosy surface veils no heart. The eyes are pretty, but no soul behind them Informs their beams. Her brain is as a bird's. Her life is ordered of a song, a kiss, A laughter and a comfit. Still she hears, That she is lovelier than the morning star: That Helen's eyes were owlish to her own: That the divine Astarte's neck would seem A raven's near her more resplendent shoulder— While she, vain simpleton, with greedy ear Drinks in the fulsome rubbish, credits it: Fool! For, beyond the knowledge she is fair, The world with all its agonies and throes, Seems like the painted landscape of a peepshow, A scene she cannot read. Nor can she map The prospect of my heart. How should she scan My nature, catch an inkling of that soul, Which burns out, like a pharos over wrecks, Through these decrepitudes, which crush it in, Behind these haggard faded lineaments? Creature of sense, poor shallow-minded ape, She only sees so far as ignorance Allows her vision. Beast, I pity her! Beast in her exaltation, still a beast, Though all men bend adoring at her car; When, like some empress, this mean forest girl Rides royal through my city on men's necks; While common mire is fitter for my feet, A clarion clears her pathway through the town; And hers to rule in is that summer home, Wherein my girlhood faded as a foam-wreath, And my dead parents came when chestnuts flowered; Now palace of her orgies. I am shamed, And very lonely in your great gaunt hall, Where no one comes. All our court-butterflies Are fluttered on to worship the new sunbeam. I would not chide them back, poor fickle wings, And yet I miss their colours and their forms; When moping here alone with leaden gaze, By the wide hearth, beneath the sombre line Of portraits—all dead kings! You leave me these Brows of the grave; you grudge me living eyes. Broken, forlorn, bereaved, I anchor here With my few girls. When first this rumour rose, How some light lass had meshed you in her wires, I told my heart that slander preyed on kings, And, great in faith, discredited the tale; And once I said, ‘My lord is often gone; If I might learn his whither, it would balm The watches of my solitary rest With wing of slumber.’ Then I gat for answer A frown, a few vague words; and yet my trust Held mooring, though the gale began to rise. Days dragged along: two pages in my ear Spake, how you built a palace. Then I watched, And found one boy apart and questioned him, And my death-sentence in his answer read. ‘Had I not heard, a wonderful bright lady Was coming to the summer palace soon?’ ‘Tell me, good boy,’ I said, ‘when she is there; For I would see her.’ In a week he came And told me, with a smiling cherry face, This adder had arrived. I bowed my head, And all the certainty of desolation Came flood-like o'er my soul. What should be done? Where must I fly? Crying out of such deeps, Whom must I seek? Why, God: how get at Him? Through His deputed mouthpiece, our archbishop, Who is as God's own angel, moving calm Along a world of error; in his lips The oracles of God shall bring me balm; And at his voice this tempest in my heart Shall fall, as did the Galilean waves Before the Master's stilling. On the spur, I sought our bishop's palace: he was gone. Whither? An acolyte looked curiously, And shuffled off: another would not tell. Last came a simpering woman with a rose, His niece or nothing, her garrulity Divulged, our prelate was at present waiting His turn to pay his court to your new devil, For all her spacious anterooms o'erflowed And hours one had to wait. I turned my heel, Livid with indignation. Yet, next morning, I forced myself to come again, I found him, The old man, saint-like in his frosted hair And clear calm eyes. He might have been in heaven The day before, rather than where he went. He heard me out, beneficently bland, Cast up his orbs and trifled with his chair; Then cleared his throat. I looked straight in his eyes, And saw the serpent rising through the saint; For hesitations and equivocations Made him seem hideous. Writhing, I withdrew: At his white mouth I gat no wholesome word. Then my heart sank, and dismally within me I held debate desponding, and exclaimed— ‘This insincerity with mitred brows, Mirage of saintship, mock and mask of goodness, This white face fleeced in grey hypocrisies, Miscalled a bishop, rightlier Satan's goat,— Whose truckling humour bends him to obey The fickle frown and evanescent whims Of one poor earth king, rather than subserve His Master throned eternal in the cloud; Of whose great service this false bishop wears The saintly badge misprinted on his back, A huge red cross; where Mammon's gibbet mark Should ride and stripe him like a raddled ram’— I said, ‘Since this most wordly, wavering prelate Shuffles me off with temporising words, And fatuous consolations vague as dreams; Since he dismisses me, hurriedly blest, And quotes me Scripture tags, which compromise No soul at all, on general good conduct, And meek submission to the marriage bond, Ordained of God—and so forth: all this mouthed By him, this saint, whose feet were even then Foul with the mire that spreads your wanton's courts, Stained with the litter of her palace—pigstye— Why, then I plainly see my piteous plight, And find that earthly help is dirt and straw. No succour shall I gain this side the stars; But how beyond? Ay, thence my aid is sure. Up there are quiet saints, immersed in heaven, Beyond the reach and taint of earth-born fear: One of these saints will hear and do me good, And bring me down hot vengeance on this drab.’ CONRAD Call through the calendar: will one descend? The saints are minded as my bishop is. They know the world—were bishops in their day A many of them—Popes and potentates— They read the age: how monarchs are perplexed With mulish wives: how kings and mates of kings Will wrangle like a bucket's endless drip: They know the weary drag of married lives, And hear the eternal jealousies of fools. Cry to them, call them! Will they answer? No! ADELHEID I thank thee: thou hast given my faltering prayer Direction where to go. Its flight's ascension Well hast thou tracked: I thank thee: it is well. I will no longer supplicate these saints. They are but dead men sitting in God's rays, Tinged with a little lustre of God's eyes— As the heads of a vast cornfield in the moonbeams Now waving lustrous, now subsiding dark— I will appeal to Him and none beside: To One, with whom guilty and glorified Are but as emanations of a breath Peopling the void with worlds. My prayer shall climb Directly to the Father, the dim shadow, The essence and the spirit and the all. I need no mediation to His ear, No priest, though he be mighty: yet He made This heart now breaking. He can understand, How it will break—O presence hid in gloom— LETALDA Refrain, my queen, for awful words are these: I almost veil my brows to hear them breathed. It is a dreadful daring to beat out New roads of prayer. Entreaty such as thine Is ominous and ghastly. Silent lips Aid more than supplication wrongly rendered. Let Holy Church instruct thee how to pray: She formulates in sentences well worn All human needs, all possible desires, Built up in words which Heaven has heard for ages. Can we, the children of a dwindled day, Cope with the mighty past; can we improve The written inspiration of dead saints? ADELHEID Girl, I will pray as my heart prays in me. My mighty sorrow speaks straight up at God, So let the Church stand by and listen awed. In such a moment God and my own soul Are face to face. Right prayer is prayer sincere. Him Churches interposed do mask and blur From those who worship well.—Great Being, hear me! Vast shadow, up and past this temporal veil, These vapour emanations, star and cloud And distance—past them all—O awful ghost, How can I word petition to Thee unknown, How supplicate the fathomless inane? Can I adore, to whom Thy very name Is an abysmal darkness, world-extended; As a ripple on the eternal water-face, Formlessly wafted, felt but not perceived? I know Thee not, yet art Thou in my prayer A living presence, with creative wing Turning the turbid waters, trinitied With Thy Son, Love, and Comfort for Thy dove. As on the morning when the world cohered And striped the void, dark strand and heaving sea. O Thou, who dost all this, and yet concealest The ardours of Thy forehead, and the out-shed Reverberations of Thy trailing locks In ether's inmost chambers. Thou—vast movement— Thou, great of shadows, whom I dare not name, Hear me in right of my great agony— O Thou beyond the darkness and the cloud, How can I make my call, how bring my prayer? Can I appeal, strange even to Thy name? When not one nation calls Thee by the same, And all are wrong, nor know Thy name as sounded In heaven's own language by the seraphim; So all miscall Thee, and no man on earth Means what his fellow means, when he says ‘God!’ Therefore I cry as some blind woman cries, Out in the street on one whose step sounds kind, To give her in her misery some alms. Are not these very weak words that I speak Wrung from my heart like blood, tear after tear? Wilt Thou, O terrible, hear any one? Are our tears pleasant, is our bleeding sweet Before Thee? Are the striving and the void, The throb, and this dark reaching out of hands, Excellent music or unheeded noise? Thou hast made Love, else hadst Thou nothing made; Else had the unformed silence still endured,— Is not Love rightly cruel as Thyself? Love Thou hast made, and beautiful it is, A dream of many lights and shaken waters, Excellent, mortal, unenduring Love! LETALDA This is no prayer of the old days drawled over To a drowsy priest in a chapel by the way. This is no mumbling at a pigeon-hole Of petty sins. But, strong as life desire, And deep as human passion, her words tower, And build a liturgy of agonies, Fearful and formless. 'Tis an awful thing, When a wife comes to praying as she prays: And, be that wife a queen, her kingdom reels! CONRAD She knows not what she says. Her prayers are wind, And wildly winnow on the idle air; Vague, hideous, harsh, they bear no certain sound. She sows down curses with a lavish hand, As loosened oak leaves sink at winter's blast. She recks not where her imprecations light, Or on whose head her bans may flutter down! O, she is madder than a wind in March, And reasonless as some tumultuous sea. Farewell, my queen, when next we meet, prepare A smoother forehead and a milder mouth. [Exit Conrad. ADELHEID Is he gone, Letalda? LETALDA Madam, he is gone— With a sudden twirl of his great purple cloak, With a sudden twist of eyebrows fulgurous; And, as his back goes from us down the walk, I see his inside hand, that fingers round His sword-hilt, and he grinds the gravel going With emphasis of heel. ADELHEID Ah, my Letalda, He is gone! Is he gone? Is this the end? I loved him very much. My bourn lies here. I think my life has no more steps to go. Nay, I will sink down senseless where I am, Among the rose-wrecks and the leaves of autumn; [She sinks down on the gravel pathway. A poor weak woman, a limp heap of robes: I cannot pray, dust thickens in my mouth: I cannot curse; for my old love of him Comes surging back, now he has gone. O girls, What can I do? Where can I go? Sustain me! [She faints. SCENE III. A magnificent room in the Summer Palace. Violet seated, attired in an amber gown with russet sleeves. At the end of the apartment a double fountain is playing, behind large coloured shells and gorgeous exotic flowers. At times Violet takes up an embroidered infant's frock, and works a few stitches on it with her needle. At her feet sits Conrad playing with her fan of peacock feathers. Conrad and Violet. CONRAD These married fountains make a pretty bower Of liquid arching rainbows, when the sun Beats them in blazing through the painted glass. VIOLET A rainbow is like a kiss: why is it like one? I am sure it is—yet why? The answer? Quick! CONRAD I'll have thy statue, as a water-nymph, Made out of purest marble: I will plant thee There in the fountain-drift and dripping flowers, For men to marvel at. Over the hair I will have gold-dust sown, and they shall tint The marble to the colour of thy shoulders, And make them rise out of a river ring Of pouting and swan-shadowed water-buds With golden mealy tongues: above it all The rainbowed water-threads shall leap and shimmer. VIOLET You are become a boy in phantasies. Can Love-stress thus degrade a man in years? Girl as I was before, our mutual passion Found me unwise and in unwisdom left me; But the crowned warrior, you! CONRAD Warrior and crown! O idle warfare, idle diadem, Let these twin words perish, and pulse away As an importunate echo from that wind, Which rocks the silly furrows of the world, And frets the foam, that on Fame's castled steep Beats up in haze. Warrior! A corse in a ditch: Crown! Why, a straw band for an idiot's forehead: Glory! A penny peep-show at a fair: Whereat some staring fools pay in their doit, And peer and find it fine. O Violet, Beyond thine arms this rubbish-heap of Time Holds nothing worth a sigh! VIOLET My love, my glory, King of that bright dream within which I breathe, In such unreal moonlight-banded glory— Amid these splendours, which thy bounteous hand Heaps round my days—that, oftentimes, I fear Lest I shall wake again among the pine-trees In that weird hall; and see once more o'erhead The crumbling banners and the rusted armour, The empty morions full of spider ropes, And spears of unremembered war; and find The old dame nodding by the painted screen, And the old watchdog baying at the woods; And shiver having merely dreamt it all,— How from the vapour of the storm-wind stepped A knight into our castle, rested him, And ate and went, and never came again. And I, the foolish, in some after-sleep Continued him into a king and lover, Who merely came to dry his rainy curls One dripping night; and under our poor roof Told me that I was fair, for compliment, Of kindness only, and went. Then must I fall On sleep, and piece the sequel as I would— Except, alas, in one thing: no, no, no; Were this a dream and had I moulded it, One thing I would alter—ah! CONRAD And one thing I Would crush and will crush like an evil worm, Which dares assail thy heel with shallow fang, When all the other vermin of my realm Keep their obedient distance, and obey. VIOLET I flung this hint out on a sun-mote's raft, As something lighter than a grain of dust, A bubble of talk, a ripple of the mind! Let not this casual wrinkle on love's rose-leaf Veer thy contentment to a vexing mood. I spake my silly heart out as it came, And not to anger thee with—anyone: I think I am happy. CONRAD Sweet, you should be so: For, Love be witness, I would shear my forests, Drain out my lakes, and rip my hills in twain To find you Happiness, this lurking thief, That still eludes the great, who might command him. I would wring out my whole realm, as a cloth, To get you drops of joy. I'd have all seas Searched, till the diver burst his labouring lungs, To bring you neck-pearls large as robin's eggs, While other queens string on their scanted breasts A puny pea-sized row. I'd lose an army, Sooner than your least kiss— [Enter abruptly an Attendant. ATTENDANT Sire, the Archbishop In hottest haste, freighted with weighty news, Implores an instant audience! CONRAD Does he so?— Who bade you tilt inside our privacy Like a bull headlong?—Let this churchman wait, And tell his beads or read his breviary, Blow on his hands or rattle with his heels,— Wait, an he list, or, does he choose, retire. I am busy now—avoid! ATTENDANT He does entreat A single second of thy royal time On thy realm's safety swagging to its fall. CONRAD Must kings speak twice; have I not said, begone? VIOLET Nay, see him, Conrad. [Enter another Attendant. SECOND ATTENDANT King, thy Chancellor Comes sweating on the Bishop's heel to say, There is bad news from Arnheim. CONRAD Tell this lord, That time will cool the heating of his brows. Let him amuse the Bishop—if he pleases— As for his tidings, they are maggot-old: I had them yester-eve. I will not see him. VIOLET O Conrad, see them both: these poor old men Are weary; see them soon! CONRAD Pack, knaves, and say, That I, perchance, may see them, if they wait, And I, perchance, may not, as either mood Holds me. Depart! (Exeunt Attendants.) The raven and the jay Flap hither, birds of bodement: the black lawyer, And his bedizened priestship. I will wager, His parti-coloured cope outcosts your mantle, His ring episcopal this dainty ring On daintier finger. Prettily, i' faith, These blue veins mimic rivulets in your hand, And lose themselves in meads of milky rose— Arnheim! Bad news: I did expect no other— I have seen this colour on the underlip Of a sea-shell—Bad news! Well, walls must stand Till cannon tilt them down. (Rises suddenly.) God, let me go, Saddle my charger; bring my spurs, and armour, Sword—any sword will do—All may be mended Yet, off, to horse!—O Heaven, I dare not leave her! [He sinks back irresolutely on the couch beside Violet. VIOLET Nay, up at once, my hero, and begone. I think, that I can bear your going now; I am not near so languid as I was; And, if I cry a little, why, for that I shall do well enough. All girls must cry! Away, and succour Arnheim: take no leave— I cannot bear it—If you go, part swiftly And say no more, yet hurry back on wings, Ere I have missed you—But have no farewell, For that's the worst of all! CONRAD My golden queen, I swear by Love's most tender satin feather, That I will never leave you on this side Of your sweet childing sorrow. VIOLET Let me weep A little—only one least droplet, gay And bright, the tear of fair content and laughter. Sweetheart, I gladden to my finger-tips To feel you are not going. Let us be Happy as children! CONRAD Ay: let Arnheim split Her citadel, and toss her loosened stones, Or tumble, one huge heap of rattling bricks, Into the upturned faces of her foes— Before I budge! VIOLET I have so many round me; And yet without thee bitter solitude Reigns in my splendid halls. I shall not be So lonely, when—O love, I may not call thee Husband, and yet we breathe together, move Together, sigh and laugh in unison: Are merry each, are sorry both at once, In such a blended mutuality, As shames the frigid name of spouse and groom. O let the other woman, if she list, Brag of her tinsel title. She retains The husk of Love, mine is its sweeter kernel. ‘I am his wife!’ she cries: ay, and detested! Queen of his love noways, thou art the queen Of his abhorrence. Pride thyself thereon, And leave my lord to me. O Conrad, husband, For art thou not in essence thrice my husband?— CONRAD Ay, and that thrice made million: as indeed I shall be, when the black-mouthed halting bell Tolls her wild face inside the catacombs Among the narrow shelves of dusty sleep— Then shalt thou be in name as in desire— Mine: (what a music the word brings with it!) And death shall ease us of this whirling plague, This headlong, noisy, stupid, boisterous fly, Which brushes at our eyes and swings itself Against the mirror of our dulcet days— Winter will numb her wings! VIOLET Peace, Conrad, peace: The picture of her burns into my soul: I only saw her once and yet she haunts me, This unqueened queen! She wore a faded mantle: And limped along; her raiment might have been Made on the very loom where cobwebs grow, So poor it seemed and dusted. In her wake Came a few moth-like women, eyed as owls, Grey as their mistress, crawled and crept behind her, As if they were a retinue of spiders. Sheer in their faces the harsh steel-tongued east Sawed piteously: as through their very bones It seemed to glide, it tossed and tore them so. Thus to hear minster mass they picked slow way Along rain-deepened roads; and barely one Heeded or did them reverence, as they went. But in my track, as I came litter-borne, A long and mighty concourse flowed behind; And, round me and before me, such a sea Of faces thickened, that my bearing guards Went step by step; and they, who cleared the way, Cried, ‘back,’ and bruised the people with their halberts, Fearing a tumult, and to bring me through Safe to my palace portals: yard by yard, They had to cleave out passage, till I shrank Flushed back into my nest of arctic furs, And reddened over like a holly bush, Half pleased, half frightened to be gazed at thus. Then my proud scorn upon that careworn queen Was rendered back with bitter interest, And shame tenfold redoubled. For a crone Pushed in her chin and peered. Her first breath blessed me, Because I was so pretty; but her next Came thick with piteous sobs: she turned away And wrung her wrinkled hands out, sobbing aloud. And, as they heard her weep, a shivering growl Made the crowd-faces hideous and austere: And one, he seemed a hybrid blackamoor, Hissed out of blubbered lips these vitriol words— ‘Kneel, vermin people, to this mammet kneel! This is the last doll of our emperor, The fire-new plaything of the tyrannous hand. Above the heads of men she rides on air, Who should ride swiftly to the death of fire, Were I the people of this queen of worms; But ye are dogs and dumb, and, therefore, kneel And pay your soldiers to bear round this jade!’ He ceased; and then a mighty bulk, who seemed Coloured as earth, his face, hands, eyes, and clothes Besmeared with tawny loam, antiphonally Shrieked from the crowd across—‘Well said, black mastiff, Thou canst yap yet. They tie our watch-dogs' noses To keep them civil to this female thief. This is the leech, who sucks our commonwealth Dry with her lancet teeth. She lives in light. Her beauty doth require as jewelled frame The rosy rays of day. Her regal fool Would chop the sun-sides into rushlight candles, Rather than have her darkened, if he could! I travail in the entrails of the ground To dig out ores to deck her dainty bareness. In her behest I burrow down in gloom And scrape my way to hell. So, when the roof Falls in and pins me flat, I shall be near My journey's end. But she, this silken fitchet Sniffs on the nosegay's musky face, reclines Her ivory heels in swan's-down. Her sweet hide Endures no glint of sun, no brush of breeze To tan or roughen o'er its rosy marble. She curtains out the beam with muslin veils. But common faces saw I, splashed with mire, Gaze on her shrouded litter reverently. I looked, and, lo, the people bent, and nearly Set in the mud their knees to worship something. “The Host is coming certainly,” said I; But, when the proud procession breasted me, I found—O dismal anti-climax poor, They carried one in triumph for her skin, And rabbles howled their worship in her wake! But I, whose dark days dig up her bright gems, Will not caress the sandals of her guards. If I must howl, then will I vent this prayer— “My Satan, my good Satan with black nimbus, Remember, thou art glorified to-day In this the person of thy serving maid; Lo, we adore thy fair ambassadress, And, therefore, smile upon our happy land; Reward us rarely, for we love thee well!”’ Then in the air he flung his cap and ended. Whereat, a hundred keen derisive glances Smote, like a sheaf of arrows, on my brow, And sent me writhing back. ‘Soon, soon,’ I sighed, ‘This agony must finish: I shall clear Their tumult in a moment, win to haven, And get beyond curse-reach and slander-shot. There gleam my palace gates.’ But worse remained; For a fierce woman, with bedrabbled flowers Stuck piteously awry in faded curls, With hard high cheek-bones raddled to her lids, Took up the cry—‘Ah, sister, hear and hail! You move beneath the sun of sweltering pride, I roll among the ditches, slimy-foul, Of desolation and decrepitude. Newts hover at my lips, and leeches float Across my bosom; all my humid hair Is greenly mixed with little duck-weed rafts. You are the lily of a golden garden, I am the nettle on some plague-pit grown. Kings by your beauty take delicious hours: The very lazar curses me for stinging His barefoot heel. Of weeds I am the snake. Yet, with this gulf between, we're sisters still, As I shall prove; and so hear sisterly A sister's word, our traffic being one. Heed well the burnish of your mirrored face: Heed well your lucid cheek and dainty lips; Lest Adelheid break in with eager nails, And crack the crystal surface of the glass, Wherein her king sees Love's reflected eyes.’ And then a tawdry weather-beaten girl, With eyes wine-swollen, caught her up and cried, ‘You prate mild measures: wench, the knife is best: The good blue blade like butter in it glides, And makes sweet silence round a rival's heart. Give me such wronging as our worthy queen, I should not merely scratch my reckoning out Upon the walls of vengeance.’ Then a guard, Who listened, smote her full across the mouth, And felled her bleeding in the kennel prone, And the mud mingled with her tinsel flowers, And matted hair, and miserable head; And, quailing, on I passed, and reached my home. CONRAD Scum of my streets, they sting their little hour, And vent out envious poison on the great, And rot like dogs to-morrow in the drains. Heed them, thou rosy-royal pearl of kings! Heed sooner the foul slug thy chariot wheel Grinds into slimy earth. But these, thy railers, An African, a delver, and a drab,— My guards will know them. They shall catch the three, And, like trapped carrion crows, on their own doors Shall each be pinned; so shall civility Increase among the herd. But these three jokers Have grinned their last grin, japed their latest jeer: Quick! Brush them from thy mind; they are quite done with; Cancelled, mere earth, top-dressings for our fields, Or powder for the grave. To such fools blatant Time is a tavern merely, on whose screens The chalky records of their thirsty days Are settled at a sleeve-brush. With such loons I can right swiftly reckon. As for her— In the wide circles of whose discontent These minnows dare to leap and show their fins, Puddle leviathans!—By star and thunder, She cannot be so readily repaid. Let her alone, awhile: let her alone! But, at no distant hour, I will devise Such echoing scourge for her insurgent whims, As other queens shall note, and, grown obedient, Under their monarch's eye be mild, and quail! VIOLET O Conrad, is she crazed or does she feign? They tell me, she runs wild on misery, And must be soon secluded. CONRAD Sane enough To play with poniards dangerously well: Keen-eyed at need, and crafty with the best To finger rift or find an eyelet hole, Whereat to prize in opportunity Wedge-like against us both. No mother fox, Whose hungry cubs starve in the lean mid-winter, More deftly gnaws in twain a hencoop wire, Than she would file and fret opposing chains, Which held her victim and her presence parted. And, though one half her wits are stormed away Ejaculating curses, she retains A mighty silent sanity of mischief Amid the gibbering incoherences Of her hag-ridden life. Concede her crazy, That doth not blunt her fangs but whet them more. I dare not leave you in her wolfish way, Next as she was in old authority Through this unstable kingdom to ourselves. And, though I've barred you in security, And hooped you round with armoured satellites, And halved my body's guard to guard your own— Yet might she steal my signet, bribe my men, And come, a tiger-cat, outside your wires, And squeeze within electric reaching paws, Weaponed with scythes: while her long-templed brow, And massive jowl, impending near the cage, Hardened the tigerish outline of a face, Whose cold, implacably dilated eyes From grey to green lengthened in fasting vengeance. Would not to have her rubbing at your windows Scare my bright fluttering dove from wall to wall? And,—though her sickled hand sawed empty air, And reached and reaped in nothing, till the beast, Wailing and wauling out her strident hatred, Grated the music of a baffled rage— Yet to envisage her most fiendish eyes,— Though gloating impotence and glaring malice Were all the harm her liquorish whiskers gleaned,— Might almost on the phantasy of terror Bereave your brain of life, and blast the bud Of our renewed affection, bringing pain And peril on my darling ere her day. Therefore, though Arnheim be as one who sighs And, ere his death-sleep, makes his testament: Though through her flimsy walls all cannon-rent The life in her seems likely soon to fly: Though, seeing my inaction, these sweet subjects Howl ‘dastard’ at my doors, and brand me craven For biding here, and tinker scurril ballads On you and me—Yet, for all this I stir not. Stand or fall Arnheim, here I peg my tent, And budge no foot for any of their howls; Though, in this night of sea-drift setting round us, This fortress be sheet-anchor at whose chain My tossing realm bites into steadfast ground, And stems the tide and barely holds her own, While wrecks and rudders of drowned neighbour kingdoms Float by as feathers on the ocean face— Even for this I move not but abide. You are my kingdom, and this one, who calls me, Is but a plain division of poor earth Dotted with cities, meted into fields, Sprinkled with farms, and varied into woods, Or humped to mountain chains. Hath this realm brought me A fragment of that immortality Which to be near you brings? My kingdom's here. What fear should tice abroad the father bird Above the mossy circle of whose home The grey impending shudder of the kite, Like a dark cloud-suspended murderer, Makes hideous all the happy blue of God? God help you, child, if she could have me dead, Or safely locked within those rotten walls Of that beleaguered city, out of reach And out of aidance—By the living Christ, She would not stay to tell her beads twice over, But smite and swiftly smite. Poor Raban's ghost Sighs in his bed of shadows answering—Ay! I merely turned my head one summer morn And found my comrade slain, my signet gone To be his hangman's warrant. This she did: And this again, chance smiling, she will do. Therefore must Arnheim keep her reeling feet Without the fulcrum of my shoulder reared To stay her staggering bulk; and, if she fall, Why, let her crash! VIOLET My Conrad, in your ear— You think not now, this river Happiness Flows with too large a head upon my days? My splendour burns me: it is terrible. CONRAD Not happy? Save this woman—whom God quell— I say you shall be happy, if the veins Of my broad kingdom, packed with jewelled ore, Can sow your couch with lustre sapphirine And blood-red rubies. VIOLET What is happiness? To say, I seek, and change it to, I find. To make my wishes instantly my havings. To feed my sense with perfume, eyes with gems, My touch with velvet foldings, ear with music, Bird-song and water-song—like the fresh drip Of that old river in my pine wood. Happy? Ah, yes, to find reflected in your eyes My pleasure in these pleasures, all of them Wormwood without you. Oh, yes, I happy seem, Happy enough. And yet (how shall I phrase it?) At times, it grows a little wearisome To have no wishes save accomplished ones! CONRAD You pretty grumbler! (Kisses her.) You will hale the soul Clean out of my poor mouth, if you put up Such pouting lips at mine! A quaint complaint! This little flower-white witch must rail on me, Complaining that I leave her no complaint, And grieving that she is not grieved at all. She shall go back into the woods, and starve To teach her better manners—Were you singing When I came in? VIOLET An old and rusty song, A song of faith forsworn—like swept up leaves In bare woods, when the robin comes, and rime Just fringes round the prickled holly leaf— The lover is exposed and proven faithless: The song says how, but I forget those verses; And so the lady answers somewhat harshly, And tyrannizes in the melody— Thus singing, as I sing—(She commences.) Take back your suit. It came, when I was weary and distraught With hunger. Could I guess the fruit you brought? I ate in mere desire of any food, Nibbled its edge and nowhere found it good. Take back your suit. Take back your love. It is a bird poached from my neighbour's wood: Its wings are wet with tears, its beak with blood. 'Tis a strange fowl with feathers like a crow: Death's raven, it may be, for all we know. Take back your love. Take back your gifts. False is the hand that gave them: and the mind That planned them, as a hawk spread in the wind To poize and snatch the harmless rabbit doe, To ruin where it dares—and then to go. Take back your gifts. Take back your vows. Elsewhere you trimmed and taught these lamps to burn: You bring them stale and dim to serve my turn. You lit those candles in another shrine, Guttered and cold you offer them on mine. Take back your vows. Take back your sighs. Unmasked you pray, unveiled you vainly plead. For grain you thought to bring me thistle seed. New flour is ground in Love's mill every day, But you can never beat bread out of hay. Take back your sighs. Take back your ring. You laid your sacks at Love our miller's door, Good corn to grind, red wheat in plenteous store; But soon the piteous godhead stayed his wheel, My bran was bolted with another's meal. Take back your ring. Take back your words. What is your love? Leaves on a woodland plain, Where some are running, and where some remain: What is your faith? Straws on a mountain height Dancing like demons on Walpurgis night. Take back your words. Take back delight, A paper boat launched on a heaving pool To please a child, and folded by a fool; The wild elms roared: it sailed—a yard or more. Out went our ship, but never came to shore. Take back delight. Take back your lies. Have them again: they wore a rainbow face, Silvered with sin and goldened with disgrace: Their tongue was like a mellow turret bell To toll hearts burning into wide-lipped hell. Take back your lies. Take back your kiss. Shall I be meek, and lend my lips again To let this adder daub them with his stain? Shall I turn cheek to answer, where I hate? You kiss like Judas in the garden gate! Take back your kiss. Take back your wreath. Has it done service on a fairer brow Fresh, was it folded round her bosom snow? Her cast-off weed my breast will never wear: Your word is ‘love me.’ My reply ‘despair!’ Take back your wreath. CONRAD The sorrow of our talk has perished well In this melodious ending, like a swan. My nightingale, I am well heartened now To see this chancellor. VIOLET That is my king! SCENE IV. A chamber in the Archbishop's Palace. The Archbishop is leaning out of a bay-window in a raised recess, which overlooks a court-yard, and commands a spacious prospect beyond it. Below him, in the body of the room, the Chancellor is writing at a table littered with documents. CHANCELLOR (looking up) A clatter in the court-yard! Who rides in? ARCHBISHOP A sweltering post, booted with urgency And spurred with fresh misfortune, errand-man From Arnheim, I assume— CHANCELLOR (joining him at the window) 'Tis certain, Arnheim! This fellow and his horse seem clad in vapour, And halt as through a cloud. As he draws rein How curiously the idlers gather in Round his tired charger's head. The beast coughs sorely, And hangs its jowl: the lame knees tremble fast. How wearily the man flings himself off! Now his spurs rattle as they reach the stones, And startle off its knees the porter's child, Who has crawled near, and draws a listless finger Through one of the round foam-flakes on the flags. [Enter an Attendant with a packet; this the Chancellor opens and peruses. ARCHBISHOP What do they say? CHANCELLOR The same old tale recurs— Arms—Ammunition—Reinforcements—Go! Lie there among the rest. (Flings the packet to the other papers on the table.) Had I my way, I'd answer thee to-morrow in such thunder, As a great army marching onward churns— But our Lord sleeps, ay, sleeps! ARCHBISHOP Another comes Riding afar on yonder mountain side: Small in the distance, greater momently. These frequent messengers of Arnheim's danger Come like ejaculations of despair Breathed forth by yon imprisoned citadel. Or rather you and I, my Lord, sit here, As Job did on the day his fortunes cracked— To watch the incoming harbingers of woe, Post at the heels of post, on yonder road-line, Slanted across the mount from cope to spur, Coursing, as dew-beads down a spider's string. CHANCELLOR I yet could save this slumber of a king, If he would rub the love-drug from his eyes, And feel his feet. The ruin of our plight Is, that this Lord is locked in lethargies. Ours is no common wave-wreck of affairs: We see the rocks but cannot rouse the pilot; So deeply is he tranced with opiate charms, So tight has Circe in her hell-toils snapt him; That, like a bird whom some snake's gaze benumbs, Full on his white witch he must chain his eyes, And find the back-ground of the world beyond her As tedious as a dunghill, or a yard Full of spoilt straw and rotting in the rain. His mind is charmed from woe: all evil tidings, Though big with bulging danger presently To crack, seem nothing in his lazy ear; Seem lispings of calamities betid An immaterial hundred years ago, Away a thousand furlongs: O quite sad In some old childish tattered story book: Ay, sad enough, and is there more to come Or does the tale end there? Then, faith, 'tis sad! Is your recital done? We thank you: go! You are dismissed; and, waving us away, He turns him with a lip-curl to his doll; As some huge school-boy smiles from idle heart To find his lesson done and play-time near— And the enchantress bows us slightly out With a mock-serious air. Her cornered eyes Watching the while his piteous-weary face With barely undivulged amusement; then, As inward-folding portals roll us out, We hear inside a titter, first of wrens, Expanding into shameless merriment; As the pert jay's, who seems to jeer at God, Alone in the holy woods, when nothing else Dare break the dewy silence. ARCHBISHOP God, fair God, Requite her these things in the shape of dust Upon her rosy mouth, where kings come kissing, As a sour shroud taste in her tender teeth; And may her miracle of girlish flesh Pasture the never-sated crawling worm Soon, very soon. And let his writhing brothers— Who in corruption hatch their myriad eggs, And people the vast vale heads of the tomb— Tug her to pieces; as an otter pack Breaks the wet quarry, ere the creature die, And strews the shore with bits and coils of him. CHANCELLOR A good stiff curse, you overseer of God, And here's an echo to it in the smack Of my palm on your hand-sole. This grip means— ‘Amen, Confound her!’ But, mean-hour, he pushes Such absolute dominion to this girl, That all our realm seems as a book's blank page, Whereon she may inscribe in black and red Her whims and wishes. Even you, my Lord, State-pilot, keeper of our souls, grey-haired, And aureoled with rays from Peter's chair, Speak this thing fairly, wag no word her way, Bow in the house of Rimmon with the rest— For fear no brow be left you to incline,— And wisely bow. Spite of our wintry heads, We shall outlive this despot of eighteen, For all her roses and her moonlight eyes. Because there is no wretch so near his grave, So wasted, dwindled, gone to lees and skin, But he may trust to sit outside his earth, And hold his bedward shovel in suspense,— Until the hot broth of a monarch's fancy Be cooled enough to spoil in gusty time. ARCHBISHOP God sees, I know, that she will swiftly pass As dried hay down the oven, as one leaf Upon the booming wind, as one poor gnat Scolding and buzzing on the window-pane; Then, as the swift air shuts behind a bird, So will her scathing course across this land Be wholly unremembered. In one night She came, this locust, born at yester-even And slain before the morrow's spring of day; Our vines lay tender in their leaves: she nipped them, And left mere branches of re-wintered bareness; But yet the dry stock of this worm-eat realm Has sap within its cells to push new buds: While she, this grig, having devoured our best, Fulfils her fate and rots, and the great world Will drink new wine, when she is dross and dust. CHANCELLOR Ay, ay, my Lord, we sit as men in the snows, Seeing full fires in the distance. Day shall break Abundantly hereafter—that's most sure— But the rub is to keep our hearts alive Under this chill and deadly veil of air, That cramps us till the sun lift. O my friend, The present of this desolated land Is as the writing of a skilless child, Soiled at the edges, inked between its lines, Torn cross-wise, blotted, dirty, and dog-eared. ARCHBISHOP And yet there's hope. I sat up in my tower A watchman and alone—alone with God— And I looked forth, and saw our brainless King Drink with his harlot out of yellow cups, Kissing her glove and softening her bright hair; While, on his northern frontier, watching him, The heights grew black with foemen; and each hour This silly play endured, crept up behind New men, new morions, new great clanging squares Of forms in mail: these deepened on the first, Who in the front ranks, craning from the cliffs, Watched without breath; as these over their shoulders Watched without breath, a wall of living eyes, Importunately patient: till the cup Of the adulteress shall have made him faint Enough—this fool beside her in the crown— For their swift avalanche to rush below, And clasp the panting wretch in easy cords, And hale him through their cities like a bear To skip to a creaking flute. CHANCELLOR So shall it be. So they sit watching his ineptitude, Now, even now, where hoary mountains lift Their frowning brows o'er Arnheim's river-bend. Here lies the very keyhole of our realm; The needle-eye through which a foe must crawl To win inside our heaven. ARCHBISHOP Now, by the the rood, What garrison has Arnheim? CHANCELLOR Men enough To hold a place castled by nature's self Into such sheer impregnability, That, if the assailants lack the feet of flies, And cannot go as agile woodlice climb Up the rough face of some old orchard wall— The polished basalt of its parapet Will make assault to each up-crawler—death! Or as a virgin with brave brown oak hair, Bosomed in breastplate of bright living rocks, Arnheim would mock their ineffectual spasms To be up and at her throat, and shake them off Her slippery sides; as the small summer worms Roll down the wind-rocked birch's satin greaves, And strew the precinct, barrened by her shade, With litter of coiled broken throbbing things!— That is the fortress—Heaven's own battlements, Whereover the old dragon's beaten angels Went into boiling chaos,—were no stronger, And yet— ARCHBISHOP Speak out thy thought—I hear the stars Rushing through glorious arcs of airless void, The trembling worlds of ether floating by; I hear a sea that shatters, and a noise, As of the earth's foundations broken through: As of iron, as of grinding rock, as the hiss Of rivers seething into furnace mouths;— As the tramp of a great multitude abroad On a vast plain in darkness; at the verge One thread of lurid sea, above it straightly Another of blear cloud. I seem to see The beaded outline of the myriad heads, To catch the shuffle of their on-coming; I seem almost to fear the swoop and scream Of wild great birds, who, now and then, in the dark Turn out their shining sides, instantly passing Back into a giant column of black haze Hung like a blight o'er those advancing heads— These things I see being similitudes; And all this kingdom's night is foul with dread, And bad with desolate shapes. Speak! Thy worst fear Has in my soul a brother, elder born And huger in his limbs. CHANCELLOR Turn up thy lip— I teem the rough wine of my tidings in. The time is gone for wincing, and mincing words, The hour is come to crush the grape of truth, And turn her keen tart must inside our mouths, Though it draw tears at the eyelids.—I have said, Arnheim is strong; meaning, the inanimate Arnheim is steep and difficult to scale— But for the living and the soldier stuff That cram her stony sides—why, weak she is, As one old woman in a hut of reeds With half-a-dozen curs for her allies To keep the lion out. So Arnheim is Packed full of troops, who quarrel, snarl, and sleep, Insult the citizens, are mutineers And turbulent. Her menace lies within; And, though the mountains bristle above with spears, She could deride them, did no recreant heart Within her whisper ‘lost.’ Not adamantine Bulwarks, nor Nimrod's citadel itself, Not walls Cyclopean, Alps heaved in between, Can keep a dastard safe. Stout hearts can hold Walls like an egg-shell, hearts it is save towns, Not wheelbarrows or mortar. ARCHBISHOP Will not gold Bribe these curs into courage? CHANCELLOR You have struck The very keynote of their mutiny. These soldiers watching menaced battlements With bloodshot eyes and empty vitals, leer And clung with gnawing hunger, almost fainting Each in his heavy shell of rusty steel Have had no pay for months. They watch and growl,— ‘Why should I serve this king, who starves me here To keep his harlot plump?’ ARCHBISHOP The end comes swiftly: Canst show me any ray of dawn? CHANCELLOR I can. All this I saw, and to my heart I said, Is the world broken, and its shadow gone Forever from the moon-face? Must we say To this old lion of calamity, Take us and ours and at thine ease munch both? Or can I gripe him by his tawny mane And fling the monster sideways? In my tower I pondered many a night; till, like a planet, The scheme of this betrothal rose in air. So vapour-vague at first, so dimly specked On the utmost edge of darkness, the last brink Of the illimitable coast of stars;— That half I feared, my vision's weariness Had conjured up a point by straining for it. But presently this globe swam out defined In ether; and, I thought, in thy fair beams, O planet, may our sickly world grow hale And wholesome. Be Urania shedding dew, Distilled in purest heaven, to sanctify The compact of these children. Their betrothal May strew a halcyon silence o'er that deep, Wherein we fast are breaking.—Hear my scheme. I will espouse with Conrad's baby heir The no less infant heiress of this Raymond, Who kings it on our borders towards the noon. And I do think, that bell, which rings their marriage, Will, with its soft vibrations, melt away The ragged edge of that Cimmerian war, Whose cloudy masses thicken over Arnheim, And roll this blight back to its arctic home, Workshop of fog and domicile of gloom-drift. For I intend against this realm of icebergs, Whose wintry monarch on our frontier thunders, To march the kingdom of the olives up, And clash against him with united armies, Swelling our feeble ranks with friends behind; And so prevail—though weak as jaded hackneys, Burst at the knees, and whealed with lash and thong By the vexing of this shallow governor, Who calls himself our king and is God's scourge. Let the good thews of this alliance win, When our poor palsied fingers drop the sword. If Raymond fail us, then the prince of snow-drifts Will litter down his nags in Violet's splendours, And water his great charger at her fountains, Ere yonder moon grow slim. ARCHBISHOP I well believe it. And what said doting Conrad, when you spread The map of this new marriage on his knees? What, when you showed him all the vales and hills, The new discovered inlets of a scheme, Which his crass soul and flaccid indolence Had raised no foot to find? CHANCELLOR He rose at once, When I had shown him the least silver side Of my new bait. Up came he with wide jaws, Keen as a pike, who for a mile of river Has met no shoaling dace. He merely snapt, Stayed not to chew upon the scheme, but said, ‘'Tis good and it will do.’ ARCHBISHOP The rumour runs, He made you write upon the spur. CHANCELLOR He did; And jogged my writing elbow with his chin, And like a gaoler rubbed against my side, And looked across my shoulder, chose the pens; And held me fast imprisoned with his presence, Till the imperishable parchment bore My fleeting thought, stampt in clear sentences, For his most royal brother in the south To nod to or renege. Then out goes Conrad, And gets his own steed saddled, a mare roan, Lithe as a snake, with lion-coloured mane, Shod with the swiftness of a blush's wing; Fleet as the sound, half shiver and half breeze, Which sets the bushes crisp, a little hour Ere the day tingles out between the cloud ways. He chose a knight, flower of his retinue, To back her swiftness: him he bade ride on Right into the red rift of future dawn: Through the long leagues of midnight, on and on; Until, arriving, when the day was broad, He galloped in among the dewy streets, And unawakened eyes of shrouded casements,— Rode with one final push of spurry heels, And one last rattle of his foamy rein, Into our Raymond's palace-citadel; And, planting there a trump against the ear Of Raymond's sleeping self, pealed loud and clear ‘I want thy daughter!’ ARCHBISHOP Good! And what says Raymond To our most sudden challenge of appeal? Hath he rent friendship from us as a sleeve, Or sewn our lands together like a hem? Which? In that ‘which’ we wither or revive. CHANCELLOR He flutters, as a stock-dove is perplexed Between a scarecrow and a field of beans. A spacious champaign for his girl to queen Is well enough, where rich grain ripens gold, And merry rivers roll abundantly, Rich-mouthed along the meads. These tempt him on. But then the rugged clapper of rough war. With drain of men, and more appalling still, With drain of treasured gold, whose yellow discs His miser fingers itch to hold, and pine To pay away on thews of fighting men— These fear him from alighting in our corn. So doth mean Raymond balance chance with chance. But in the end, believe me, we shall win him. For nothing is so sweet to any man, As meddling at his nearest neighbour's house; And in an ancient friend's embarrassments To intervene with lofty patronage, And help him—just a little. ARCHBISHOP I believe you. Our peril preaches credence in your scheme. The land is halt, and you a crutch have found it, Wherewith to reach the healer Safety's doors. If Raymond will not marry us his girl, We were a realm, but we are one no longer Swallowed as Jonas by this arctic whale— So reassure me, saying, ‘All frames well!’ CHANCELLOR The mainspring is well oiled, a side-wheel hitches. Is it not strange, that, talking here together, We seem agreed to drop one name out quite? A name of power it was not long ago; You have not yet found heart to speak it, Bishop. 'Tis now the barking stock of any cur; They call her in the taverns—(Whispers.) ARCHBISHOP Such a jest Is bridegroom to the grave and the worm's cousin. I would not whisper this into the reed-beds, Lest at one sweep I should lose ears—and head. CHANCELLOR Cheer up, man, 'tis in vogue to scatter mire, Where our most gracious Conrad plasters it. The crowned arch-hunter brought the eagle down: But, fallen as she is, the scurviest knave Can spirit show and loyalty at once In rending forth a plume to write his gibes Upon those wings, that once disdained the cedars, And moved among the stars. So this poor princess, Who once sat up between the sickled moon And the bright bundle of the Pleiades, Is tumbled from the air of royal favour Prone on the plain, a seraph castaway, Her vans all broken! Let us bravely come And add our kick. ARCHBISHOP You bring her wisely in. She on this rite may claim a casting voice. She made the limbs of this young master, who learns Love with his whistle-pipe; who may wear willow In leading-strings, and furnace out a sonnet, Before he knows a letter in his horn-book— What says the queenly mother? Right is hers To interpose opinion. CHANCELLOR Nay, for that, She said the merest shadow of a nothing, And wept to say that much. For, when these nuptials Grew into shape, and half the realm had inkling, That such an egg of royal policy Would soon be laid by our great ostrich Conrad,— I took occasion with this secret bird. To say—‘Most royal master, may thy slave Inform thy wisdom with one little hint? Were it not wise and easy and politic, And after thy magnanimous great heart, To give the Queen, my lady, one kind word; Wheedle and coax her into saying “Ay”; Pretend to make her counsel launch the boat, Which stems, already far, the central tide; And mother this our scheme on her assent, Who at its birth stood extern and apart. I tremble, lest she thwart us at the last, If left to brood outside thy council-doors A cipher; when the whole land's ringing lips Canvass the bargain of her weanling sold To bring its country peace, and loose the zone Of menace from the forehead of the realm. Shall she, with her large mother share in him, Have neither hand nor lot in all this stir? But rock the cradle like a hireling nurse, Whom the high destinies of that small mouth, To which she sells her breast, concern noways: Pushed sidelong, as a cow, when nature's office Is served, and held no higher in our Rome, Than was that Capitolian wolfish mother, Who lent her teats to Remus. Fie, my king, Enwind her in thy councils, ask her mind; Let her arrange some trivialities To balm the sense of slight: seem to concede Something not worth concession: mould her so Into our projects, that she push our way And not athwart us. Shallow womankind Forgive a year of wrong for one kind day. ARCHBISHOP He did thy council. CHANCELLOR Ay, with meagre grace: Said a few niggard words, that he was sorry For the raw past between them, roughly told her, That, if she chose, the coming years might mend; Her hand had been too hard upon his mouth: He was a king, no jade to set his paces At anyone's direction: wife she was, Not despot: guided he would be, not mastered:— And in this tenor more. She asked him mildly, Whither his converse tended, why he came To mock her desolation? For he came So rarely now, the cause that drew him then Should be indeed right urgent. Had he come To let her know, that she was doomed to die? If so, she thanked him for civility And found his tidings sweet. At this he laughed A harsh forced laughter, to his lip-roots pale, And kissed her hand. She seemed so lost and careless, She did not even snatch the hand away, But like a dead weed let it lie in his. Whereat he answered, ‘Marriage and not death Brings me to-day.’ She with a bitter smile, Leaving the hand still with him, flashed reply,— ‘You cannot marry until I be dead, So, if you come on marriage here to-day, You come not less on death, a trivial one, That must precede her crowning.’ ‘Nay, you are mad,’ He said and trembled. ‘Will you sanely speak, Or shall I go, and send my Chancellor To say what I would say?’ She snatched the hand Fiercely and flared—‘I bear no go-betweens; Say mouth to mouth your business or be dumb. Are we not, as God sees us, wife and man? Can twenty rosy harlots hinder that By brazen intervention: rive our chain By baying, curs, in chorus?’ ‘Dame!’ he cried, ‘Be civil.’ ‘King,’ she answered, ‘deeds which lie Creep under civil cloak and speak you sweetly In honey syllables and mouths of meal. But honest anger when it deals with dogs, Does not go bowing and scraping for a phrase, But simply names the nature of the cur, And gets the matter done.’ He chewed his lip Fiercely and fingered at his hilted side, And flowed in equal thunder, ‘Mad-woman, Hear, mad-woman; deaf sleeper in the storm, Rise up and wake, rouse you and feel ashamed; Who, in the boom of sky-rack and cloud-clash, Hear but your own small grievance, egotist,— The miserable wail-chirp of one grig, When all the meadowy vastness of the realm Is wild with tossing elms, and waving grass, And churned crops flatling laid with hammering hail; While all the distance, a red tempest smoke, Reeks up in anger. Will you listen, listen? I have such peril on my foreland north, Such mutiny within my kingdom's veins, Such stint of feeding gold to nourish her, That there is left one safety from the death, Which creeps in at her heart. Strengthless we may Ally ourselves with strength; and baffle doom By setting other sinews than our own To grapple with this angel of the dark In the great plain of shadows. We encounter Death by vicarious onset with his edge; So will our limbs elude his swinging scythe, Which, feeble-jointed, are too shrunk and lean To be marched up against these sons of snow; Broad, turbulent, and blood-distended knaves, Ruddy with rapine, solid as their beeves; Impenetrable as the boles of oaks To arrow-head or spear or brandished sword. Therefore, I wrote in my extremity To Raymond, saying, “Let my foes be yours, And whom I hate, hate also. Let us join Front warlike with the world. Let him, who cribs A rood of either, feel the lash of both.” Then in the midmost of the letter came The kernel of request, for there I proffered, As a strong cord to wrench alliance tight, That we betroth our infants, son and girl, His girl with my son—our son, I would say— What say you, Queen, to this?’ The shallow King Made such an abrupt ending and curt close, That all the woman in his consort's heart Grew fiery at the slighting: round she turned, And knitted up the fingers in her hand, And made a silent motion with her mouth, But did not look at him. Again he asked her About this child-betrothal, ay or no, As at her lips he must have yes or nay; Whereat, she merely said,—‘Your child, at first, And our child after. Lo, the kinder last Allows me a little corner of my babe To make me proud withal: delusive pride, For he is sold already like a sheep With no leave taken from the mother ewe. Child, O my child! Is he my child at all? I did not dream that you had left me him. Then I be richer by one baby's heart;— Nay, you do wrong to leave me this rich thing, Who have despoiled me of all else held dear. All good things have been taken long ago Out of my life and heart, and air and eyes. Complete my spoliation. Leave not one. Love is gone, honour followed, self-esteem Went afterwards: hope, joy, content, repose, Sat once like starlings in the boughs of Time: But now the tree is dead: and, with a whirl, They are gone into the red divided disc Of sunset: they are gone? Must the child go? Earth has a many sorrows: I fear one— That on some morning you will come, my Lord, And claim your child, and bear him to your love, To be a little page to lift her skirts And tend her lap-dogs. Ay, my Lord, thus do! You have taken her my life, take him as well: For I am such a beggar in this world, It seems unequal with my other fate To be so richly childed. It were simpler To play the sonless Niobe as well As Ariadne on the Naxian dunes:— So take the child, and wed him—if you list— Or strangle him: I care not!’ There she ended, And in a storm he left her. ARCHBISHOP Did he so? Nay, but this brews to mischief, by my crozier! CHANCELLOR God knows the issue of all this; not I! Meantime, do you with me, as duty leads, Grasp the state's helm and stormwards keep her head. And, while this dotard King and frenzied Queen Drill in the ship's side holes, let us take heart, And pilot her to haven—if we may! ARCHBISHOP Sir, I will second you and pray to God. [Exeunt. ACT V. SCENE I. The cathedral, gorgeously decked and illuminated for a church festival with wreathes, flags, and tall candles. The Archbishop in full pontificals stands at the High Altar. Behind him are bishops and priests in rich vestments. On the altar-steps appear boys in white with red sleeves, swinging censers. The organ plays and the bells are ringing. To the right of the Archbishop is King Raymond's Ambassador; on a raised dais at his side is set a cradle with lace curtains, containing an infant asleep. On the Archbishop's left is placed Conrad. Near him is a similarly constructed dais, but on this no cradle is yet rested. At each side of the altar are ranged ladies, nobles, guards, pages, heralds, &amp;c. In the outer portion of the dome a vast concourse is densely packed, watching the ceremony. ARCHBISHOP Lo! in the name of God I cite thee, Conrad, And thou, who in the person of thy lieger Appearest, Raymond, thee I summon also; Twain kings upon this holy morning met At the high altar of a greater Lord, In this vast dome crammed with the entire realm, To see this nuptial done; whose living faces And bent eyes watch me innumerably round! Now let the rite proceed. Fling incense up, And make the ribbed roof crack with organ throbs; For never in our annals came a day Grander than this. The boys in your vast crowd Shall wag, years hence, their winter-hoary heads And chatter, ‘I was there!’ The little maiden, Just old enough to keep unstable perch Upon her father's shoulder, half afraid Yet more delighted, blinking like a bird Into the blur of lights—shall tell hereafter Her grand-daughter about the golden show; When of the breathing mass within this dome Two-thirds are dust. O beautiful live men, And comely breathing women fresh as spring, O ye that listen to me and feel so elate, So sure upon the pivot of your days, So firm upon the planting of your heels; Who feel at life so strongly with your hands, Who root yourselves so deep in human love, In hope, and pomp of earth; who in your veins Feel throbbing stuff sufficient at this instant To keep your eyes open a thousand years— You acres of earnest faces, over whom I stretch my ancient arms and number you, One, ten, a hundred, and the hundreds roll To thousands, and dim thousands swell behind— Lo, I the ripest apple on Time's bough, The soonest to drop dust-ward, cry to the child, Saying, ‘A little while and a little wind, A few more swathings of the head in sleep, A few more changes of the crumpled leaves, A few more airy mornings fed with sun,— And all these glorious creatures, whom I see So excellent in loveliness, shall come To lie down very darkly in the dust Without sweet words, eye-wish, or brain-endeavour, Till in the rounding earth their atoms mingle;— As, if one pour a wine-cup on the sea, A few short rockings does the stain remain Insoluble and separate, and then The liquid giant changes the red patch With the inroads of his salt immensity, And rolls the red speck blue. So shall ye fade In the ocean of the grave, when the wind raving Rocks up in air the roots of Death's own yew, And mingles in the ashes of our bones With inorganic dust. But, though the man Wither, and though his hand rot off the wrist; Yet, if it cut the rock deep with his name, The after generations will go by And read of him for ever. A great deed Burns in a stormy turret wave-beset: And bright ephemeral vessels come and go Over the waves at foot, like butterflies, And, wafting soon their short-lived pomp away, Sink in rude seas or rot in harbour sides; Yet still that great light steadies on the sea, And the new fleets roll in it and rejoice. Therefore, not one day or a thousand years Will wash the bond we consecrate to-day Out of Time's annals. Two great lands are come Under this dome, two lands of vengeful past And immemorial hate—in wedding robes Are come to fold each other with tight arms, And kiss away that past on mouths which hunger From abstinence of love. Press palm on palm; And round each wrist I will such cordage wind, Such interchange of fatherhood to-day, That Raymond wound in brother-bond with Conrad, Shall plan no war apart, no truce alone; But they shall bid the vulture-bearing storm-blasts Of their hereafter battle-fields unroll One ensign, on whose silky billowing sheet The arms of either monarch interlaced Shall crimsonly expand o'er miles of spears. Let hand lock hand, till Time, which is Love's shadow, Build up in sweet maturity the limbs Of either childhood, his with manly bloom, Hers softer than a rose-leaf; until both These wedded flowers be ripe for mutual fruit, And mould an infant bud, who shall be grandson To Raymond as to Conrad. I have said, And may God send a rapid angel down To catch my words before they fall to earth; And feather them with strong prophetic plumes To sail the kingdoms till fulfilment come. And now, my Conrad, stand up here on high The central star-point of all watching eyes, Greatened in incense fume, rise out alone— And lay thy right hand on the cup and bread, Thy left on the black altar crucifix, Which bears aloft the nailed God in His woe,— And, grasping each, swear with a great voice, swear! On the wood of His passion, on the chalice of His blood, On the crumbs of the incarnate sitter on stars,— That, while He give thee eyes to light thy brain, Good hands to feel thy fortunes, and stout feet To bear thee bravely o'er thy kingdom's soil,— That, till the grave end eye-light, touch, and going, Thou wilt to this alliance bear thee true, So Christ thee succour! CONRAD With a firm true heart I swear, I will be faithful to this bond, Touching the flesh of Him, who left His stars To be a baby in a trough of kine— Handling the blood, which fed the hyssop roots On Calvary; whereby the souls, that swam In the wide stake-nets of Hell's fisher-fiend, Expecting fire, brake mesh and flapped away With joyous fins erect into the fruitful Rivers of paradise—Hereon I swear; By my soul's hope of climbing into Heaven, By all that consecrates a monarch's days, By wafer, wine, and crucifix, once more,— I will love Raymond with a brother's love Now, and hereafter, till I drop to dust! AMBASSADOR And I for Raymond on these elements Swear with an equal emphasis the echo Of his loud adjurations. For my king, I say, these seething proffers of your loves Are cold to our vast incandescent heart, Which here out-rays on Conrad and his realm Whole atmospheres of kindness; as the sun Turns his abounding warmth across the globe, And gives, and gives, and gives. Never to end We stablish here alliance. Never to snap We hang in angels' sight a golden cord From Conrad's star to Raymond's. O ye faces, Eyes earnest, and innumerable brows, Reach forward in your crowding, crane and see; (Pointing to the cradle) Have I not rightly said, she is a star, This infant planet cradled in her heaven Of cloudy down: which rises, as she sleeps, On either hand of the small head, rose-rare, And gently breathing in her flushes, pure, Waxen, and warm, clad with the gloss of flowers, And beamed upon with the mixed light of morn And the last faded moon-ray? Bud of kings! See, as I part the cradle-curtains, shines This wonder to be wedded! Ah, in her sleep Doth the bride know the terrible sweet hour Slides out of Heaven, and, winging towards her bed, Hovers and poises, one hand on its lips? Ah, does she tremble, catching through her dream, Some rustle of his silent vans, some sigh, Some drip of a tear? Will she wake, and find day Torn as a leaf, and night poured on the ground,— When the bridegroom knocks? Ah no, she will sleep child-like, And years and years shall push this picture back, Until it shall be limned in love and fire. But she is ignorant, poor thing, to-day, That on her tiny hand whole empires lean; She saw not many faces heretofore, Except her nurse and mother. She recoils Into her pink cream-coloured cradle-shell, And buries down her forehead in the lace Among the satin sides and broidered fringes, And marvellously sewn and folded lawns. She shrinks at such a storm of sudden eyes,— As some small tender snail held up to light Contracts inside the cavern of its home. O King and people, I am here to-day: My arms are treasured with this breathing gift, The royalest, which ever Lieger bore From the bosom of his King, to give away; Because his brother in the purple here Said, ‘Give me of thine innermost and best: That which thou sparest readily I refuse. Give me thy very flesh, rend it away, And in the ache of this great loss sit thou Dazed, dull, and bleeding: thus I shall make sure, Thus deeply prove thy love commensurate With my exorbitance. Thus shall I sound The fathoms of thy generosities: So, thirsting, shall I gauge, how large a bowl Contains the measure of thy kingly trust. Therefore, I now exact no less a thing Than thy one child.’ Whereon, my master said, Not even in this have I refused thee, brother; Take her yet shining with a father's tears As after rain a lily. Ere these dry, May some one in that other garden kneel And kiss with greater right the brow they chilled! So, from the weeping face of him I serve, Bearing this wonder in my arms, I came Through the deep valleys to her nuptial day. Lo! she is here. Clash bells: call in the groom! ARCHBISHOP All things are ready for our sacrament Of spousal benediction. Holy Church Steeped to her lips with blessings, brinked to flow, Says to her children—‘kneel; and ye shall taste My welding consecration!’ Royal Conrad, Whence comes this tardy tarriance of thy queen? Why is our yearling lover's cradle absent? The bride keeps better time. This little lady Will rate her true-love laggard as a toad, To hold her waiting at the altar rails!— Comes not the Queen? (Aside to Conrad.) CONRAD By our Redeemer's tree, She trifles, ay, she trifles.—You and you, Why stare ye dumbly at your neighbour's nose, And budge no foot? Rush out and fetch her here: Begone, an army of my satellites, Instead of trembling there before my face, Useless, without expedient. Instantly Scour to this moody Queen; in thunder say, That, if she comes not hither in an eye-wink, I will out and push her here with battering rams, And hoist her in upon a catapult. Fly, run, tear up the flags! [Exeunt Attendants hurriedly. CHANCELLOR There is no need: A hushing wave of silence smites the crowd Around the giant door-ways of the dome; Stiller and stiller grow the wrestling heads, How pale the people at a clap seem gone! Now a hoarse ripple of wild whisper comes, Crisping across their blank astonished brows— That's a strange buzz, which deepens on us inwards, As shivers, which begin at finger tips And to the heart roll on. I feel, the Queen Has reached the doors and comes; but I do fear She comes in no good fashion. (Aside.) CONRAD Coming—coming! By God, I say, 'tis time indeed she came. These women must be late for everything, And dawdle out their lives. I do believe, That at the day of judgment they will creep Too late out of their grave-brinks. Coming—coming! She takes her leisure fairly over it, And up the aisle drags on her leaden steps, Pausing and panting. Can these robes be black; Or does the shadow tinge them? At this pace, She will burn down the day-light getting here, Through the divided lane of bowing heads: She snuffs up adoration like a goddess, And lingers out its taste. This makes her crawl So crab-like up our aisles. [Adelheid enters attired in black. She walks on feeble steps slowly up the centre of the cathedral. The crowd opens her out a passage. Behind her come Letalda and another lady, bearing between them a completely white satin-covered cradle; of this the lace curtains are closely drawn across the front, so as to veil its child occupant. The cradle is deposited facing that containing Raymond's daughter on a similar dais. Adelheid takes her stand over it. CONRAD So, Madam, you at length do condescend To greet our pining gaze. We fear, you derogate, Though late you come, in being here at all. You hoard your presence in such high seclusion, You fear to waste upon our trivial show The aroma of your rose-bud privacies. The slight occasion of a son's betrothal Is hardly worth the wear of shoe-leather, It may have cost you coming! We have watched And wearied for your advent,—that must please you. A King has waited in his Lieger's person,— That sweetens on the palate of your pride! The whole mute realm—King, Commons, Army, Church— Have held suspended breath; and, straining ear, Yearned, ‘Will she never come?’ And that must please you! For, by the Mass, I speak, good Madam Queen, For this assembled concourse, as its head, And we allow, that you have made us all A thousand Jobs to dog behind your whims, As humble scholars in your school of patience. Sweet Queen, 'tis well and very wisely done: 'Tis burnt across our souls in lines of fire, That you are so insufferably great, That, though the pot of empire over-boil, We must not jog your pace into a run To lift it off the blaze. You take occasion Of a wise day and an auspicious one, To flaunt these ragged whimsies of revolt, To daub your discontents o'er sacred walls; 'Tis well to advertise this face-crammed dome The ductile wife your good man has in you! How bland his sleep must be, what dreams of heaven Must visit Conrad in that hornet's nest, Miscalled his marriage bed. All this you have told us, And sweetly and most sanely blared it out! And, as your deeds are lunatic at core, And whimsical as pieces of a dream, Harsh as a braying mule or wheezing boar, Ill-sorted as a hay-rick, out of tune As a frayed fiddle or a squealing brat:— Black in a word—black as your arrogant heart— So is your garb one-coloured with your act. Why come you here arrayed to mock our rite In such audacious dissonance of sables? Why do you spill this ink on the fair page Of our most clear and candid ceremony? Why do you stalk in here, like some dead nun Lashed from her grave by devils for her sins? She could not come in inkier than you do! Whom are you here to bury in that weed? Came you to hide in earth your shrewd ill-humours, No grave more blessèd ever yet was dug, No sepulchre more golden for us all, Grassed with the snow-drop peace! No, no, 'tis merely The moonish itch to be at odds with all men, To give offence, rub time against the grain: To say, ‘when folks are laughing, I will weep. If they wind orange wreaths, I gather cypress;’ And make them stare and say,—‘How grand she is!’ And in such rank unweeded insolence You dare to treat us to this antic guise: Where are the crows, whom you intend to scare By mimicking their rusty backs so well? Most gracious dame, have you misread the bells? It were sheer merriment and insult laughter To ring them at that canter o'er a coffin, And to dance music shovel in the dead. No, Queen of sullens, there is some mistake: We celebrate no obsequies to-day: A wedding this, a wedding, and a grand one! ADELHEID One thing is grander—death! I came in hearing His plumes above my head—I seem to see him— Some folks have died upon their marriage morn! As for my robe—I am sorry it mislikes you. I merely thought to match the mind I wear. Best is she robed, who robes for any chances, Who, if those merry metals in the roof Calmed down to intermittent drag of iron, Need not trudge home and shift her garish fleece; But in good time prophetically mourns First in the ranks of sorrow! CONRAD And I am sorry, Most sorry, my good Lord Ambassador, That on the rainbow of this fair occasion So sour a cloud should set its inky brow. That in this beaming pomp, this vast assembly— A concourse, which in varied glory vies Almost with the emparadised sweet scenes Of our expected saintship!—I am sorry, That, when all hearts throb to one pulse of concord, And in their myriad beatings hold one time— That this forlorn, distraught, desponding woman, Who anguishes in the gate of agonies, And in corrosive madness eats away Her own heart's fibres, gnawing at herself, A vulture cannibal; as if Prometheus Needed no bird of Jove to come and rend him, But did its hideous office on himself. I am sorry this distracted shadow Queen Should intervene among these sanctities, And stain the crystal of felicity With ravings worthy of a madhouse chain. The pity of her state, my Lord, is this: She ebbs and flows, like an afflicted tide, At any moon's impulsion. Moon at wane: You might as well in fetters case a dove! After a sennight, Luna growing round, More wisely shall you rob a wood-bear's young Than baulk her flimsiest whim. What man or spirit Can say her dove days or her tigerish hours, Or chain her variance to prediction down? Meek-eyed and piteous, yesterday she came And craved permission to attend. I urged Her frequent illness: she insisted, promised No tumult should ensue. I, easy man, Nodded reluctant leave; in fear I gave it: For in the perilous balance of her brain A hair will overset her swagging wits: A dry leaf grating on a gravel path Will lash her into frenzy: rivet eyes Upon her face, she shivers like a reed. So in the exaltation of this day's Great serious rite, her fit recurs in rigour. I might have known as much. But, being so, She must be borne. We have no choice but bearing. Proceed, Archbishop, and regard her not. Get quickly through the rite: betroth these children: Catch not her eye: keep thine upon thy book, And mumble on despite of interruption. Ignore her accents, thine can beat them down— Read, at a gallop, read! [Adelheid presses forward in front of Conrad and the Archbishop, and addresses the crowd from the edge of the altar platform. ADELHEID O bitter wolf, Mad am I then? Ay, carrion fox, you tear The sane sun of my reason from my breast, That in its darkened absence you may take Your lecher ease, and feed on sinning hid. Of outward honour you long since bereft me, And now you come to swear away my soul; And to crush out that last, that latest spark, Which keeps my miserable body sweet, And strong enough to count your perfidies: Which gives my miserable body rushlight Enough to singe this creature of the stews. CONRAD (to the Archbishop) Man, read her down in thunder— ADELHEID God read him Black in the last book, if he dares: be silent. (To the Archbishop.) If I held not one riving arrow strung, (To Conrad) And nearly twanged against thy panther heart,— I could weep—could weep— ARCHBISHOP Madam, be temperate: You have strangely moved the King. ADELHEID He shall be riven More strangely yet.—Sides then the Church with vipers? Doth she push down the bruised and broken lives, And help them into the fanged mouths of tyrants? You hold your bishoprick on gracious service To wait in harlots' ante-rooms. Be dumb, Or I will hold your varnished holiness Up as a muddied mirror, cracked and flawed, To the wild people. ARCHBISHOP Madam, I have regretted Always the King's new—ties: I will be silent. CONRAD On thine allegiance—read! ADELHEID God will reward Thy dumbness. (She addresses the crowd.) O my people and many faces, Save me a little silence, for, God knows, I think, that I have ended, almost done My day of earthly speech. O patient folk, Like calm contented oxen roped and harnessed To pull along one paltry tyrant's plough, To drag his shares across your mother land, And make her bosom bleed to profit him. O Titan folk, who ear this weakling's field, Who hold your mighty-thewed great hands abroad, Your myriad-wrinkled palms, supreme in toil, For the lean wage of one weak man's oppressions— I have seen your shameful servings, I have seen You reeking under huge laborious loads, As waggon horses stream in frosty air. All this I saw, and in this hound's behoof I wronged you much in once my golden day, And ask you at my last to pardon one Abolished out of queendom, near her end, And hardly mistress of her own sad soul, As Conrad rightly tells you: mad in much, And chiefly in this delusion lunatic, That I laid down best love, best blood, best service On a hound's kennel. Now discrowned I wake Sane to revenge. God's winnowing fan in hand, God's word inside my brain-beat, sane to act My wrong's unwronging. Very sane to know, When the last stone is built into the pile, And the arch stands for ever, monument For any wife and any mother here To plant with grateful flowers, when I am gone. Some mother out among you there, come near! I would have such an one approach and scan me. It seems an idle fancy, but I would Press the live blood within her hand on mine, Once more, because she is a mother merely. Is not that strange? But dying folk have whims. Forbear me for a little and allow them! Here, mother, you I want: peruse my features. These (would you now believe it?) once made up A pretty face enough. You see such faces On many rosy maidens of eighteen; And some of these, when their poor bud sniffs spring, Will conjure up mad dreams in multitude, Which, as we sane-mad grave-brink people know, Come true by opposites. These girls persuade you— Poor hearts, they know no better, pardon them— That Love is not a lie—We know he is! That the chance congress of swine meeting swine Is not called wedlock—But we know it is. That motherhood is not a curious wheel, Whereon our husband tyrants tie our hearts, And break them, nerve by nerve, and string by string, Through years and years of married agony— That much the stupid world knows very well, And sees it every day, and shrugs, and cares not Even to break a scurril jest thereon, So wholly stale the wrong.—I do not speak To all who front me: nay, to mothers only. Ye, ye shall judge me alone: since o'er our patience The same toothed harrowing wrong has torn and past, And ye have bled and shuddered as I bleed. On you I make my cry, mothers, who hold Live babies at the fountains of your milk, I charge you by your love to these—avenge me! I pray you every wife in this great crowd To mark this fellow: he is adulterous. I clasp this nailed Christ by these bleeding feet, And swear on them my death lies at his doors, At Conrad's, Conrad's doors! I feel your hearts Bound up in answer, ye are moved: I see it. O joy, God speaks out plainly in your faces. Come in your millions, crush him at the altar, Rend him asunder with his harlot girl, And sow the mangled pieces of each swine Over the altar face, good sacrifice, Sweet to the nostril of an angry God. [A hoarse and ominous murmur rises from the outermost portion of the crowd. A fierce movement commences from behind. Those in front are pushed inwards. The guards endeavour to drive them back. CONRAD To the winds patience! I do fling it from me, As useless scabbard to the sword of courage. Is this a rabid woman dog, who flings Such mortal poison from her foaming teeth? Who can use ceremony with a tigress? She works the people up to murder us. In self-defence brief ending this deserves: Out we must hale her like a drunken drab. On her, my guards! A hundred marks to him, Who plucks her up and bears her wrestling door-wards. You need not be too tender of her head Against the columns, if she grapple fiercely. Out, at all cost, she goes! A hundred marks! Remember: now, men, with me: all at once— [As Conrad advances fiercely with his guards to seize the Queen, Adelheid draws forth a dagger. Conrad and his satellites recoil in confusion. ADELHEID The show is nearly done. A little patience And we shall get the curtain of death down, And put the lights of the world out. Mothers, see, I am the best of all you mothers round me. The proof is easy: ye shall grant me this Dearest distinction ere my night clouds come. Draw in and learn my vast solicitude. I am more tender of my infant's peace, I love to lap him longer in my arms Than any mother here. Sweeter to me It is to give him suck, to rock him sweeter To sleep upon my heart. O mothers, mothers, So have I rocked him now. This is the day Of his betrothal, and I have betrothed him— Only my bride and Conrad's are not one. The father made his choice, the mother hers: Neither asked neither, both were swift and silent: But my bride first is with my little son— No lass of veering Raymod's: earthly wives Are not so soft and dark and wholly good, As is my choice—Nay, ye shall see her swiftly— Mine is a virgin young as yesterday And old as God's beneficence, who made her. She does not sigh or murmur or talk at all: And, once she gets her arms about her groom, She is too loving ever to unclasp them. To her I have given this baby, not to thee, Heiress of mortal monarch. Can you guess The name of the new bride? He lies in there Wedded already. Strip the curtains back, (suddenly unveiling the cradle-head) And crowd in, all of you, and crack your eyes With gazing.—See, nay, see! Why start ye back? Her name is Death! He is asleep with her— Fools, will ye waken up the blessed bridegroom? Fools, will ye see, that he is dead—dead—dead! I cannot find a tear. This strange betrothal Is done. You may go, all of you. (Waving her arms.) [Great confusion in the cathedral. A rush takes place towards the doors. Other surge violently forward. CONRAD (clasping his brow) Murderous demon! Thou shalt be torn into the grave for this With such ingenious pangs, such writhing torment, That the worst death, which traitress ever died, Shall seem to thy fierce agonies a bed Of downy sleep. My judges shall unearth All records of the direst cruelties, Which ever hatred's torture-teeming brain Proved on the limbs of weak humanity To glut stupendous vengeance, which has fed For ages like a leech of painful veins. They shall rake through and harrow up that hell, Which in the bitter death-books of the past Lies chronicled with shrieks and ghastly sobs. And they shall crush their essence from all woes, And pour it on together, till thy carcase Be one great boil of suffering. ADELHEID Prithee, husband, Be cruel a little quickly, else I fear I may outstrip the laggard faltering wings Of thy benevolence. Poor foolish ape, Lord of one little patch of wintry ground Misnamed a kingdom. Thou the slave thereof, I cannot call thee King, whom paltry passion And abject lust crown with the cap of fools, And hang with bells that clouded diadem Thou stolest. Hear my words, and, as thou hearest, Grind round upon a wheel of fiery pain— Listen! I kissed my angel all night long, But I had promised with the morning light That he should drink. I rose up quietly— Made no great fuss—I did it, as I had done A thousand common household things before— I merely went and laid some deadly poison Upon my breast: I kissed him as he drank. I did not weep. Who weeps in real sorrow? My beautiful, ah my beautiful, how I felt him Drawing the death in from me. The sweet made A quiet holy end. I laid him there I'th' cradle. I am poisoned too, my husband! We slew each other: his dear lips diffused The drug into my bosom. Prettily I' faith he killed me. I've an hour to live, And, maybe, half an hour. Is that not strange? I can laugh and pinch his cheek. Now torture me, Who am nearly with my darling. We shall sleep Beyond thy kindness.—Liar! Listen: I seem Endued with fire prophetic, as my eyes Begin to swim with darkness, and strange thrills, Forerunners of the end, begin to clench And rive my withering frame—Hearken, I hear A sound of vengeance singing down from God, I hear His curse, winnowed on giant wings, Slide out of heaven on thee. (A noise.) It strikes. Thank God! I thank Thee, gentle Christ. [Adelheid sinks back exhausted on the ground, supported by Letalda. Renewed tumult succeeded by a dead hush; during this a lane is cloven through the crowd, by which a Messenger rushes up the church to Conrad. MESSENGER The Countess Violet, Scared by a letter from thy furious Queen, Fell into bitter pangs an hour ago, And in her swoon died—(pants) died— CONRAD (veiling his head) Thou hast said it—died! ADELHEID (on the ground, rocking the cradle vacantly) My treasure, my poor treasure, could we live, You and I, once again, and let me feed you, And with my kiss unpoison your sweet lips! But they are hard here, child, and death is softer— 'Tis better where we go! (She dies.) [A second Messenger here enters, and comes rapidly up the aisle amid increasing panic and confusion. SECOND MESSENGER To arms, to arms— Arnheim is taken, sacked, and overthrown. The garrison hungry, betrayed, surprised, Are cut into the fragments of a worm; And I, alone out of the jaws of hell, Fled on with dripping wounds before their lances, To warn my King. O man thy bulwarks briefly; The foe are marching hither like a sea, With thousands and with thousands. By the noon They will be here. CONRAD Thou hast said it. We can die. A CAPTAIN Nay, my King, up and wrestle for our lives. I followed thee to Arnheim years ago, And then we got her back, quelling worse flood Than surges on us now. Lead us once more, And rescue Arnheim; thou art young as then: Captain, King, father! Once thy soldiers loved thee I kneel to thee: brush off these hideous sorrows: Lead us again. CONRAD (flinging himself on the body of Adelheid) I cannot lead you now! (The curtain falls slowly.) THE END.</field>
