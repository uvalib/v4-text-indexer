      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Almachilde. Ildovaldo. Rosmunda. Romilda. Soldiers. Followers of Ildovaldo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Palace in Pavia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Rosmunda, Romilda. Ros. Perfidious woman, put up to the skies Thy unavailing vows; address to Heaven, Which hears thee not, thy ineffectual prayers. Meanwhile the sanguinary battle rages On the Ticinus' shores; e'en to this place I hear its clamour: nor in doubtful hope Doth my heart waver: certainty of conquest Do I infer from the high martial virtues Of my new consort. Rom. Yes, if in the camp Thy Almachilde be as much distinguish'd, As he himself distinguish'd in this palace, Then when he sacrificed with trait'rous hand My father Alboino, he will conquer: But Clefi, who is now his adversary, Does not now lie immersed in indolence, Clasp'd in a guilty consort's arms, as lay Thy husband Alboino on that night Of memorable horrors. Round his standard The noblest heroes Clefi hath collected: He with his warriors doth at once maintain The sacred cause of violated faith, Of outraged heaven, of multitudes oppressed, And of the infringed laws of Lombardy: And fervently I pray for his success. Ros. The dregs of Lombardy alone have flock'd Round Clefi's mutinous standard; he counts not One man of noble blood among his followers: Indeed, he well deserves that thou shouldst be So strenuous in his cause. For art not thou The daughter of a king? Oh! fortunate My fate, in truth, that made me not thy mother! Sprung from a monarch, canst thou entertain The vile desire to see the royal power Cast with the throne to earth? Rom. Upon the earth Rather would I behold the throne, than fill'd By a contaminating, guilty upstart. The consort and the daughter of a king, Say, wert not thou? Thou, who hast dared to give Thy hand in marriage to a trait'rous subject? Ros. To any man, that dared avenge my cause This hand of mine was a due recompense. I was constrain'd by dire necessity To luckless nuptials with thy cruel father. Yet reeking with the life-blood of Comundus, My wretched father, Alboino gain'd me Orphan and captive: the impious Alboino, He that discomfited my partizans, The spoiler of my patrimonial realm, The insultor of my wretchedness. At length From this inexorable fatal yoke, 'Neath which I languish'd for so many years, I breathe. And now the rancour will burst forth Which with so many conflicts I suppress'd: Now thee, the abhorred child of Alboino, (Of whom, for my especial happiness, I'm not the mother,) I will banish thee For ever from my sight. Thee I dispatch A spouse to Alaric. Rom. I? ... I the spouse Of Alaric? Ros. Yes. This appears to thee A small revenge, and small indeed I deem it, When set against the injuries I endured From Alboino: but it pleases me Thus from my sight for ever to remove The impious remnant of thy father's blood. I, for the covenanted aid received From Alaric against the troops of Clefi, Have, to the former, pledged my royal faith, As an equivalent, to yield thyself. Exult: thou wilt have, as thou dost deserve, A spouse magnanimous: and though a realm Vast as the one usurp'd by Alboino, The Eruli on Alaric bestow not, Yet he assuredly may vie with him In frantic cruelty. Thee, Alaric Happy will make, as Alboin' made me. Rom. Do not expect that I should ever yield To nuptials dire as these. If thou'rt victorious, And thirstest for a plenary revenge, Amid these very walls (round which doth stray The unavenged spectre of my father, Where the vile traitor, by whose hands he fell, Lies by thy side e'en in his very bed,) The daughter thou shouldst immolate: and there Opprobrious torments, and protracted pangs, On her inflict. But thou presume to yield My hand in marriage? ... Ros. Thou, with Alaric, Wilt find the furies of a cruel step-dame Join'd to the furies of a barbarous consort. Those whom, at once, I fear and execrate, With death I punish: thee, whom I fear not, I would chastise with life. Rom. Say, who can be Thy rival in barbarity? Not I. There are no tears, no cries of innocence, That can thy bosom pierce: yet, save my tears, I now have no defence ... Oh Heaven! but no: I can, and I know how to, ease myself Of the intolerable load of life, So that I go not to this destined marriage ... Perhaps 'twould be more expedient for me, Bringing thy dagger, and thy noble arts, To Alaric as a dowry, thus to make My coveted alliance cost him dear: But am I Rosamund? Ros. I am; and feel Proud in the consciousness that I am she. The world knows well that I was not the first To practise cruelty. Rom. If towards thyself My sire was cruel, rights of war produced That cruelty; but thou since ... Ros. Rights of war? In the most cruel and inhuman clime, Say, was it e'er a right, that impious rage And sacrilegious scorn should violate The unburied relics of the dead? E'en now Doth Alboino not before my eyes For ever glare at that unnatural banquet, (Banquet of death to me!) with pride, and blood, And fury drunk, at his dire table placed, Wantonly gibing! Do not I behold him, Sated with wine and beastly gluttony, (Ah, horrid sight!) with a malicious coolness Quaff his protracted and intemperate draughts From my slain father's skull? Then send to me, Mantling with the abhorred beverage, The execrable chalice? In my ears Doth not that scornful sanguinary challenge Eternally reecho? âDrink, Rosmunda; âDrink with thy father,â tauntingly he cried. And thou, from such a monster born, dost stand Before my eyes? If having first slain him, I had suborned the vilest miscreants First to contaminate, and then murder thee; If having burn'd your bodies, I had then Scatter'd your ashes to the winds of Heaven, Yea, even thus, I never had obtain'd A vengeance equal to the wrongs I've suffer'd. Go; vex me now no more. 'Twill be to me A grateful spectacle to see thee dragged, Spite of thyself, to this abhorr'd alliance: Now thou in vain resistest; thou by force Shalt go. Be other hands, rather than mine, Polluted with thy blood. But, go meanwhile; I do not wish thee here, now I expect My Almachilde conqueror from the camp. Go; and prepare thee by to-morrow's dawn For thy departure: 'tis my will: obey. SCENE THE SECOND. Rosmunda. Ros. How much I hate her not e'en I can tell ... There are sufficient reasons for this hatred; But it too nearly doth concern my peace The cause most irrefragable and valid Not to investigate. A dreadful doubt Distracts my heart ... But perhaps I am deceived ... Ah! no; there is no doubt; the certainty Is no less positive than desperate. My consort, with those alienated looks, Beholds her not, with which the murderer Should contemplate the daughter of the murdered. He speaks sometimes without aversion to her; And also speaks without aversion of her. Perhaps by her false insinuating arts, For I can ne'er impute it to her charms, He is entangled? ... This suspicion never Shall ripen into certainty. Far, far, From hence, for ever be Romilda; far ... At such a thought I feel my burning blood Rush through each throbbing vein. Must I, in thee. Oh Alboino's execrated child, A rival also find? Suspicion, hence ... Hither comes Almachilde ... Let us see Whether or not I am deceived. SCENE THE THIRD. Rosmunda, Almachilde, Soldiers. Ros. Already the acclamatory shouts, The festive banners waving to the wind, And the demeanour of the stately ranks, All, all proclaim it; thou art conqueror. Al. Saved, and secure, and victor, thou dost see me; But not by my own prowess. Life and power, Freedom and conquest, Ildovaldo only Confers on me this day. He was my shield; He my magnanimous defender: he, In my behoof, such proofs of valour gave As far surpass my powers of recompense. Ros. If I conjecture rightly, thy sublime, Impetuous valour had impell'd thee thither Where most the danger raged. Ah, little then, Didst thou recall to mind the agonies, The tears, the apprehensions of Rosmunda. Thou know'st how much I fear'd thy too great valour. Yet in the promise which thou mad'st to me Before the battle, not to expose thyself Incautiously or vainly, I confided. This I besought of thee; and thou to me Didst swear compliance; ah! what should I be, Tell me, bereft of thee? My throne is nothing, My life is nothing, if with thee not shared. Al. Thee, and thy fondness, I recall'd to mind. But I was forced, by bravely meeting death, To shew myself Rosmunda's worthy spouse, And worthy of the crown of Lombardy. How could I, in the camp, save with my sword, Make an atonement for that fatal blow Wrought by my guilty hand? Ros. What? dost thou dare Profess repentance that thou hast avenged me? Al. Ah, yes! 'Tis not the vengeance, but the mode By which that vengeance was obtain'd, that grieves me: And which I shall eternally regret. To cleanse my character from such a stain, I was compell'd, e'en to the latest drop, With reckless prodigality, to spill My tainted blood. I heard myself proclaim'd, With fulminating vehemence, a traitor, By Clefi and his heroes: I confess, That to the centre of my guilty heart The well-deserved, insufferable name Resounded. I deny it not, that then, Mindless of all except my impeach'd honour, Where most the combatants and weapons thicken'd, I fling myself: with unimaginable rage Desperate, I wheel in circles my bright sword; And with its trusty blade give ample proof That I far less deserved the name of traitor Than that of hero. Instantly around me, Of slain, and of disabled warriors, Mountains are piled: when my good charger falls, Beneath my weight transfix'd; on earth I spring; But on the ground, slippery with blood, my foot Ill planted, slips, so that I fall again. Swiftly the hostile troops conglomerate, And with their strength collected rush on me. In vain my impotent and baffled sword Gives ill-aim'd proofs of its expiring prowess. When swifter than the lightening's vollied flash, 'Mid troops, and spears, and shrieks, and swords, and blows, With a few followers, Ildovaldo opens, E'en to my side, opens a fearful track. The assailants instantaneously disperse; To right and left they fly; in complete rout, Broken, they slink away. My followers Having resumed their courage, on their heels Press irresistibly; their griding swords Obtain an ample harvest; whence, at once, The uncertain fortune of the day is changed To overthrow, and universal carnage. Ros. At length I breathe: at length thou'rt safe: I fear'd No other obstacle to thy success Than that of thy imprudent hardihood. Already 'mid the chiefest of this realm Was Ildovaldo rank'd; now will he be Second to none but thee. Al. And towards him So much more grateful I am bound to be, E'en in proportion, as before the fight Some envious miscreants sought to render him By me the more suspected. He it was Whose foresight warn'd me not to trust the aid Of Alaric, long deferred, and haply faithless. More than the assistance of a thousand others His sword avails: he is my chosen champion: And he not only has with triumph closed The fortunes of the day, but of the war. Fame, though with different and discordant tongues, Yet with them all speaks prodigies of him. That Clefi now is in his hands a prisoner; Now that he's wounded mortally by him; And there are those who furthermore affirm That he is slain already. I refused To trace the footsteps of the fugitives: I am accustom'd only to behold The faces of my foes: but their defeat, By Ildovaldo's lofty hardihood Ere now is consummated. I rely On him implicitly; he, in one day, This menacing array of hostile strength Hath utterly abolish'd by his skill. Ros. I grieve that Alaric's retarded arms Had not a share in this day's victory. Yet not the less with him will I preserve My faith inviolate. In future times He may assist us; and, which is a point Of more importance for us to remember, Us he can always injure. 'Tis decreed Romilda should be his: this I to her Already have announced. Wouldst thou believe it, She dares deny her hand to Alaric! Al. Oh! can I hope so much? ... And can she dare So much to hope? Ros. Yes. But in vain denies it: I have inform'd her that to-morrow's dawn Must witness her departure. Rather would I Forfeit my throne than thus betray my faith. Al. But yet ... compassion for the unhappy daughter. Ros. Daughter of whom? compassion, dost thou say? What do I hear? Should she who is the child Of him who slew my sire be aught but wretched? Al. It seems to me, that by severe commands We should not sadden this victorious day. Romilda is the last remaining issue Of the ancient kings of Lombardy: e'en yet We on the throne are insecurely seated: Each subject here doth cherish in his heart The recollection of the martial virtues, And of the rapidly increasing power Of Alboino, their legitimate lord. The Lombards, led by his victorious steps, Have ravaged, bound in fetters, or have burn'd The whole of Italy, far as the Po Doth water her, far as the Appenine, The Alps, and the Adriatic sea extend. The slaughter of a king so prosperous Entails on us a mighty stress of care, Inveterate hatred, and incessant peril. Tired of an arbitrary king, the people Presumed to raise the standard of revolt: 'Twas easy to repress them: since the veterans Preferr'd the undivided sway of one. But if the troops should see the daughter wronged Of their once great commander, who could then To their allegiance trust? And what are we, Tell me, bereft of them? Ros. To me it happens, Without a precedent, and unexpected, That thou to-day, in an affair of state, Shouldst feel discordantly from what I feel. Arms I resign to thee; but, in my palace, Who shall prevent me from being absolute In arts of peace? Ah, do thou come to give To nature the repose it so much wants! 'Gainst open hostile arms thou art to me A shield: but each less noble care, unmeet For a proud warrior, to me belongs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Almachilde, Ildovaldo. Al. Come, Ildovaldo, to my arms; embrace me; Thou of my glory art the chief support. Subdued, I must confess, by thy deserts, I have no recompense that equals them: But yet, if I am able ... Il. Good, my lord, Ascribe it not to merit in myself If near the royal standard I have fought Against the banners of the faithless Clefi; From my first unripe years, my ancestors Have in my breast instill'd such principles, That still the cause, whate'er the cause might be, Of him who reign'd, seem'd sacred in my eyes. Al. Thy modest speech gives of a loyal heart A pledge most unequivocal: I know it; A man of prowess, ready to do more, Esteems what he has done already nothing. But what more now remains for thee to do? Thou hast completely routed, or destroy'd, Those my perfidious foes, whom cowardice Imp'd with such rapid and fugacious wings. Breathless myself I left them in thy hands: I knew that thy sword, where it was at work, My sword would supersede. Il. Fortune resolved To smile on my endeavours. In thy power, Clefi comes manacled before thee; smitten, But with no mortal wound. If at his fall Some sparks of valour glimmer'd in the hearts Of his adherents, soon were they extinguish'd; And with their leader all their spirit fell. Al. My heart, oh Ildovaldo, put to proof. Is there, in all the world, a favourite object To which thy wishes tend? Ah! speak; I dare not Offer thee any thing; but yet (who can Except thyself?) say what were that reward Which least would wound thy virtue. Il. Prince, I will not, Since such to thee I am not, in thy presence Assume the semblance of a passionate friend. The throne, rather than thou, I sought to-day To rescue by my arm; the throne, whose safety To-day in thy existence was involved. Some one in future perhaps may fill that throne For whom I should account I yielded little, In yielding life itself: hence, in its cause Was I a hardy combatant. Thou seest That to serve thee was not my chiefest thought. Hence thou art not my debtor; and already From the importunate load of gratitude Thou art by me released. Al. The more I hear, The more do I admire thee. Yet by thee, In this high contest, I will not be conquer'd. Myself thou lovest not, and this to me Have others said; yet hence to trust to thee A portion of the fight, nay, e'en the posts Of greatest confidence, I never doubted. I blame thee not; since thou wert rather urged By the attainted honour of the throne, Than by my peril, valiantly to fight. I know that to a hero like thyself, The means by which I sit upon the throne Cannot seem worthy: I myself am first Those means to execrate: but thou dost know, My generous enemy, what horrible And stern necessity to them impell'd me. E'en me, another's subject, e'en myself Once as thy equal thou didst see: nor then (I dare to challenge thee to this) seem'd I Unworthy thy esteem. Alas! my fame Is now no longer spotless: learn thou now, That I, in heart, far far more infamous, E'en than I'm deem'd by others, deem myself. But on the bloody throne in indolence I do not sleep; and hope to clear myself, In part, of the intolerable blot, (Never, oh never, to be quite effaced!) Th'excruciating epithet of traitor. Il. I thought assuredly thy heart had been Far more corrupted by the name of king: But yet it is not sound. To feel remorse, And yet retain ... Al. And wish I to retain? Ah! long ere now ... Il. But yet this throne; thou know'st ... Al. I know that to another it belongs; And that it is not mine ... Il. Then ... Al. Listen to me. 'Tis in my power to make myself to-day Far less unworthy of the throne I fill. Hear me; and afterwards, if thou canst do it, Refuse to countenance my purposes ... But whither does my blind desire impel me? I have not yet a recompense discover'd For thy past services, and yet presume New ones to seek of thee? Il. Ah! yes: speak on. Deeming me one that for magnanimous deeds Expects no recompense, thou dost alone, By this conviction, recompense me amply. Speak; wherein can I serve thee? Al. Do not hope That I shall tell it thee on other terms, Except thou first, if in the world there be Aught wherein I can serve thee, at my hands Challenge that benefit. If of the realm Thou wishest a great part (by merit all Is thine,) or if some less ambitious thought, Some gentler impulse, agitate thy heart, From me conceal it not: I know full well All blessings are not centred in a throne: I know that there are other things, which gain'd, Would far more constitute my happiness. I know that much is wanting to my peace. I know that in my heart an impulse lives Which is the master-spring of my existence; And more it burns in me, the more it meets With obstacles. Ah! do thou then to me Thyself unbosom, that I somewhat may Benefit thee, now that thou canst so much, Though others rights thou hold inviolate, At once my cause assist. Il. I will speak out, Since thou wilt have it so.âI wish not power; Ah no! ill couldst thou this confer; and gifts, These always are of penitence and blood. But since thou hast promised to unfold to me Thy inmost thoughts, I will not of my own Be niggardly. That which alone I wish From thee would nothing take, and to myself Were life. Al. Name it; 'tis thine. Il. For a long time In love I've lived. Rosmunda can alone Prevent the accomplishment of my desires, And thou alone persuade her to relent. Al. And she that has inflamed thee? Il. Is Romilda ... Al. What do I hear? ... Lov'st thou Romilda? ... Il. Yes ... But whence in thee such wonder? Al. To myself Thy love was utterly unknown. Il. But why, Now that I tell it thee, art thou thus troubled? Why thus dost hesitate? ... Al. I? ... pardon me ... I'm not perturbed.âRomilda! and hast thou Thus for a long time loved her? Il. What means this? Perchance my love displeases thee? Perchance That love doth not become me? Though she be Of royal origin, I am not vile. Rosmunda is the daughter of a king, And she disdain'd not to bestow her hand On thee, my equal. Al. Is there any rank For thee too lofty? ... But thou know'st ... Rosmunda Disposes of Romilda; ... and that I ... Il. Canst thou, perchance, gain nothing from Rosmunda, And yet from thee she can obtain so much? Enough.âI am already satisfied: Thou hast already royally rewarded All my much-vaunted merits by ... a promise. Al. Ah no! ... believe it not ... I will ... But speak ... Romilda ... and doth she return thy love? Il. Romilda ... See, she comes. SCENE THE SECOND. Almachilde, Romilda, Ildovaldo. Rom. Oh, Heaven! with whom Do I behold him?âOh, my baffled wishes! Hast thou, at last, entwined thy spurious crown With laurel wreaths? Does treachery to-day The palm of conquest gain? And be it so. But thou, oh warrior, of a noble soul, Oh, Ildovaldo, wherefore dost thou waste Thy lofty efforts in a cause like his? Should so much virtue stoop to make itself A shield to so much infamy? Al. Towards me, Lady, eternally implacable, Is there no length of time, then, and no mode Of assiduity, that may avail, E'en in the least degree, to calm, or sooth, Thy just disdain? How in the camp I sought That death, from which himself delivered me, Can Ildovaldo tell thee. Ah! thy pity Towards me was ill directed: I should there Have died, since her my victory offends. But Heaven, who knows the innocence of my heart, (Ah, were my hand as pure,) Heaven, perhaps, today Gave me not vainly conquest and renown, There where I sought for death. Il. Accuse me not, Romilda, that I fought. Clefi with arms Came not to yonder camp to avenge thy father; Himself the exterminator of the throne He haughtily proclaim'd; and for that throne I combated. Rom. To this oppressed race, Clefi, as he profess'd, once more design'd To restore freedom, or himself to reign. And he adopted, to obtain his purpose, Means far less infamous than those employed By thee his predecessor. In the camp, In the broad light of day, he boldly challenged Man to meet man with soldier-like defiance: And if the fates decree that an usurper Should fill my empty patrimonial throne, Let it, at least, belong to the most valiant. Al. Breathes there the man who dares to call me coward? In their invasions of the throne, have others More bravery shewn than I in its defence? Dost thou eternally resent? The error That I committed with unwilling mind, (This all well know) I only can repair; Yes, I alone. To yield thee good for ill To me will be delightful: with my blood I have meanwhile the empty throne defended; Thine is that throne, I know; I swear to thee, Thy rights I ne'er forget. Long, long ere now, Had I obtain'd my wish, thou had'st possest it. But now Rosmunda fills it, and it is ... Rom. Polluted throne, thou meed of treachery, Without regret to others I resign thee; Be by Rosmunda fill'd; she, with thyself, Of such a heritage is well deserving. But if thy penitence be not dissembled; If to magnanimous words the practices Of a degraded soul could e'er accord; Obtain for me, I pray thee, not the throne Of my unnatural mother, but obtain For me alone the empire o'er myself. I ask a free life; or I ask for death. As if already in my murder'd father She had not fully satisfied her rage, The impious Rosmunda, to inflict Torments more exquisite, protracts my life, And sends me as a spouse to Alaric. Il. What do I hear? Al. Listen, oh Ildovaldo! Thou now canst judge thyself, if without cause I answered thee with doubts ... Il. Of barbarous Alaric? Al. Ah! no ... Rom. To Alaric hath she betroth'd me; And of assistance never sent am I The recompense: and she, who of my throne, And of my father, robb'd me, hath to this Plighted her faith: and (who would e'er believe it?) Rosmunda will, on no condition, now Betray her promise. By to-morrow's dawn, I to these nuptial rites am doom'd to go: But that to-morrow's dawn is not yet come. Ah! if than she thou canst be less atrocious; If 'tis indeed my fate, that I to-day Must be a suitor to my father's murderer; Ah! try at least to wean her from this purpose ... Al. Shall I try this? to thee I freely swear That thou shalt never go. Il. And, by this sword, I swear the same. Rosmunda, thou shalt hear me. Rom. Behold; she comes in rage. SCENE THE THIRD. Rosmunda, Almachilde, Romilda, Ildovaldo. Ros. Dost thou thus here Loiter with her? thou, also, dost thou lend An ear to her seditious words? This is A day of joy; what boots it then, my champions, To tarry 'mid the everlasting groans Of this devoted daughter of misfortune? Sigh'st thou, poor girl? and wherefore dost thou sigh? Ragauso, with a royal retinue, Prepared to obey my orders, waits already There to conduct thee, where auspicious nuptials, And where another more illustrious throne, Court thy acceptance. Al. But of Alaric? ... Ros. What, does not such a king deserve her hand? Al. So cruel ... Ros. Cruel e'en as Alboino? She from a blood doth spring, in whom the sight Of cruelty, whatever shape it wear, Can ne'er excite surprise. Il. Such marriage rites ... Al. To all disastrous ... Ros. Dost thou disapprove them? Al. She her consent refuses. Ros. And dost thou Refuse it? I consent. Rom. Does it annoy thee That he is less inflexible than thou? Ros. And dost thou think that he for thee feels pity? Pity for thee? What darest thou to say? For thee he feels no pity: woefully Thou art deceived ... Al. As far as human breast Can, in its fullest force, I feel it all; And I avow it; and, if thou compel me, I also will display it. Who can see, Nor feel compassion for her, who can do it, Such insults heap'd upon a royal virgin? ... Ros. All men may pity her, save Almachilde. Il. If yet thou bear'st in mind the plenteous laurels Which, for thyself, my sword has reap'd to-day, My councils thou wilt hear. Much loss to thee, If thou dost wrong Romilda, may accrue. Al. Yes, fatal loss. Il. Thou wilt, if wise, abstain. Ros. Wise is Romilda; and she will obey me. Keep thou for others thy advice. Dost thou Already magnify thy services? What hast thou done? thy duty. Thou, my husband, Dissentest thou from me? and dar'st thou say it? And must I lofty arguments of state Discuss with thee before these witnesses? Let us depart; ah come: for a short time Leave her to penitence and wiser thoughts: Her fears will give her, when she is alone, Suggestions more judicious. Leave her now.â Romilda, heard'st thou? Or by dawn of day Go willingly from hence, and thou shalt have An honourable escort by thy side, Led by Ragauso; or refuse to go, And he shall be enjoined to drag thee hence. SCENE THE FOURTH. Ildovaldo, Romilda. Il. Drag her? ... what do I hear! Ah, kill me first ... Oh Heaven! Romilda ... must I lose thee then? ... Rom. Ah! since the moment that my father died, And I beheld myself within the power Of such a step-dame, in my breast I cherish No other hope, except the one of death. Il. But, while I breathe ... Rom. Believe me, there remains Nought else for me. I am prepared to die, More than perhaps thou thinkest: in my heart I wished to see thee yet once more, and give thee The last farewell of love ... Il. Ah, hold thy peace! Loving thou'rt loved, and speak'st to me of death While I breathe vital air, and wield this sword? My soul, indeed, with sorrow is oppress'd, Yet I despair not. Rom. Say, from what quarter then Can I expect relief? Il. From hands like these, And cannot I avail to rescue thee? Rom. Yes, thou may'st do it; but what will ensue? They have a throne; and, in abundance, hence The instruments of persecution: fierce, Yet at once subtle, is Rosmunda's wrath. Can that be baffled? ... And should I once more Fall in her power? ... Now flatter not thyself: My faith I cannot keep, except by death, Inviolate to thee: thy sword, thy valour, Thy life, do thou preserve, blows to inflict, By which my father's shade may be appeased, And my shade also. Live; I leave to thee T'avenge a father and a king betray'd, And thy most faithful mistress. Il. What do I hear? Oh, Heaven! my heart thou rendest. Ah! ... if thou Shouldst ever leave me ... certainly for vengeance, And nothing else, I live. But yet I hope That thou wilt see fulfill'd, with thy own eyes, The vengeance of my king and of thy father. 'Tis true, that kingly power I do not boast: But much the terror of my name can do. I in the bosoms of the valiant reign; The abject I despise. Beneath the banners Of Alboino I have fought already. I, in the camp, have many partizans In arms accoutred; in the ranks of war Oft have the Lombards witness'd my exploits. Each living man the venerated name Of Alboino with a sigh pronounces; And thou'rt that Alboino's only child. And, as respects the multitude, if all That I now say were not; speak, if thou canst, Whether, 'mid those who shew thee violence, One man can be adduced, who, in his heart, So as to bear comparison with me, Burns with an elevated flame like mine. Rosmunda, much as step-dame can, indeed, Hates thee; but I love more than she abhors, I, who at thy least nod would rush to death, To give it or receive it. Rom. Oh sublime, Incomparable lover! ... Yet though great, Thy fondness hath no strength to countervail Her frantic and inexorable hate. Il. Think not preposterous hope doth make me blind: I am sustain'd by valid arguments, Add too, that Almachilde, as thou heardest, Dares to oppose the execrable rite. Rom. From him what canst thou hope? Il. Were I constrain'd To stoop for thy deliverance to deceit, I on his aid should ground no trifling hope. I see already that his guilty consort Is become irksome to him. To remorse He yet appears to me accessible; The fear of her alone, in which he lives, Renders him timid and irresolute. That which he feebly counteracts in words, I can induce him more effectively To counteract in deeds. I do not doubt My skill to fortify his half-resolves With my entire resolves. Rom. Thou little knowest Rosmunda. Dost thou dream that force can be A hindrance to her will? Prayers I address'd To Almachilde, (and I now repent it,) That he would intercede for me. Vain hope! Shall that man, who to a flagitious wife Has sold his reputation and himself, That man who owes whatever he possesses, Nor to another owes it, to his blind, No less than infamous subserviency, Shall he, I say, assist, against the wife Who holds him thus in thrall, her hated rival? Il. Ere it be night, let prayers, or menaces, Or blows take place, let fate determine which, So that I lose thee not: still of this day Enough remains my purpose to mature. Quickly shall I discover if in others Or in myself alone I must confide. Hither shall I return to thee ere long: If then our only remedy is death, Death is decreed. Then, then will I receive The last farewell which thou would'st yield me now; But thou no sooner shalt to me have given it, Than, drunk with love, and anger, and revenge, I swear to open with my own right hand A horrid path of blood ... At least the death Of many victims shall precede my own. But can it be that others can exult In our extinction? No one do I see Betwixt the throne and thee, except Rosmunda. Rom. And Almachilde? ... Il. Almachilde, sayst thou? To-day this sword of mine his life preserved: And should he be ungrateful, this my sword May also give his death wound. Time and chance Shall shape my independent purposes. Meanwhile, a swift return, eternal faith, A lofty vengeance for thy murdered father, I swear to thee. Rom. I would not rob thy heart Of all its hope; but in myself one hope Alone still lingers, once more to behold thee; And on that hope I live. That I should now, If thine I am not, drag on life, in vain Wouldst thou desire. And that I should be thine What expectation can I now retain? ... But in returning here to me be not Tardy, I do conjure of thee. Il. I tremble When I behold how desolate thou art. No not to live, I ask of thee alone Delay, till death be indispensable: This swear to me. Rom. I swear it. Il. I believe thee. To give my last instructions I fly hence; And here I speedily return to thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Almachilde, Romilda. Al. ... Ah pardon me, if perhaps inopportunely I dared to ask of thee in this thy threshold A transient audience; but to prove to thee How thoroughly my heart doth disavow The cruelty of thy malignant step-mother, Is of deep import to my bosom's peace. Rom. And shall I trust thee? Ah! if this were true! ... But what, am I so wretched that I ought To owe the smallest solace to thy bounty? ... Oh my hard fate! I am, alas! too wretched!â From these abominable marriage rites Ah do thou respite me; and I perchance To thee shall owe my peace. Al. Far more than this, Far more, I'm ready to perform for thee ... The prey of Alaric thou, by whom we've seen Two wives already slain; one by the sword, The next by poison? Thou, oh Heaven, design'd Of every virtue, each accomplishment To be the recompense; and who couldst make Every man happy only by thy presence!â âAh, no; this, while I breathe, shall never be! E'en if thou wished'st it, I would prevent it: Infer from thence, if I will suffer it, When unexampled violence is doom'd To drag thee there. First arguments and prayers, Then shall Rosmunda witness menaces, And lastly deeds. And if I cannot win her, She shall be wrested from the monstrous project. There lives not one more ardent in the cause Of thy defence than I: or thou shalt spend Thy days within these walls, or I will lose My kingdom with my life. Rom. And wherefore thus Generous art thou towards me? Al. I never felt Torment more exquisite from any cause Than from thy hate. Rom. But can I ever cease To hate thee? In indignant menaces My unavenged father ... Al. What sayst thou? I kill'd him not: Rosmunda murder'd him ... Rom. All are convinced that, by her menaces, Thou to the horrid treachery wert compell'd: But yet the alternative 'twixt thy own death, Or of inflicting death upon thy king, She gave to thee. 'Tis true, that thou already, Ignorant thyself of the dire stratagem, Hadst stain'd thy monarch's bed; but with thy blood, And with the blood of thy immodest mistress, Thou wert required to wash out such a stain; That was the sole atonement for thy crime: But thou dar'dst make atonement with a crime Of a far deeper dye. That death which thou Gavest another, to thyself was due: Yet thou still sleepest in the injured bed; A subject thou, the consort of thy king, And the usurp'd and blood-besprinkled throne Thou keepest still; and, doing this, dar'st thou Boast of thy noble heart? speak of kind deeds? And dost thou hope that I should trust to thee? And dar'st thou hope that I should hate thee less?â Portentous, melancholy as they are, Let me no more from the everlasting night Of silence such remembrances recall: I may suppress them when I hear thee not.â Rescue me now from this extreme distress, And perhaps thou mayst appear to me my saviour. But, if I think of thee, what art thou else To me except the murderer of my father? Al. Must then my tears, my penitence, remorse, Avail me nothing? Rom. To this subject now Wherefore direct thy thoughts? Can I hurt thee? What signifies to thee my enmity? The powerless daughter of a murder'd king, What profits it to flatter her? Al. To fail Is human; but contrition for a fault Distinguishes the virtuous from the wicked. Thou canst not know the anguish of my heart; Ah, if thou knew'st it!âFrom the day I weep, That I became the inhabitant of these Lugubrious walls, where always I behold thee Immersed in tears; yet thou at once art seen Mild in thy anger, modest in thy grief, In suffering magnanimous ... What heart Is there so hard that doth not feel for thee Emotions of compassion? Rom. Thy compassion! 'Tis too humiliating for me to bear it ... Yet ah, my destiny ... I am not able Entirely to despise it. Al. Ere that aught Which I can do challenge thy gratitude, Say, is it that he is accounted cruel, The only cause of thy antipathy To Alaric? Rom. And Alboino's daughter, Doth she not, in accepting thy assistance, Betray herself sufficiently? Wilt thou Also that she participate with thee The secrets of her heart? Al. There then exists With thee a motive for reserve towards me? Perhaps thus the means of an effectual aid ... Rom. And if there were another? ... But thou art ... What saidst thou?âHitherto I here have lived, And here 'twould sooth me by my father's side To share his tomb: art thou not satisfied? All my thoughts now are centred in the grave; But death to me would be more welcome here: Hence this I ask from you, to you a light, But to myself a most important gift. Al. Death! Ah, Romilda! I to thee repeat it, Here shalt thou have a cheerful dwelling place; And more I say to thee, I hope to see thee Here reinstated in thy usurped rights. I can, if not thy sire, thy throne restore; I ought to do it, and I will; and I Will make thee, by no doubtful proofs, behold The bias of my heart ... how deeply there ... Nay how indelibly ... I bear impress'd ... Thy image ... Rom. What is this I hear? Alas! What looks! ... What meanest thou to say to me? Al. ... That which I cannot how conceal from thee ... That which thou mayest on my trembling face Now read engraved ... I burn, and long I've burned With love ... for thee. Rom. What dar'st thou to confess? Oh cruel destiny! hast thou reserved me For such an outrage? Al. If thou dost esteem My love an outrage, I have ample means Myself to punish ... Rom. Ah, thou wretch! dared'st thou Colour with virtue thy atrocious passion? Al. Alas! ... Oh hear me ... criminal desires ... But criminal effects thou ne'er shalt see ... For thee I will do all; but from thyself I demand nothing. Rom. Peace. Shall thou, defiled Still with my father's blood, name love to me? Thou love to me!âthou art Rosmunda's spouse, And of no other worthy. Al. Ah! what name Of execration do I not deserve! ... Yet that I love thee is my destiny, Inevitable destiny; and never, Never will I this prostrate posture quit, If first ... Rom. Arise, be silent, and depart ... But here comes one who quickly will extinguish A flame like this ... Al. Who is it I behold? SCENE THE SECOND. Rosmunda, Almachilde, Romilda. Rosmunda. Me thou dost see, perfidious traitor! me.â Ye are well match'd in turpitude: to learn The certainty of your disloyalty Stabs me the deepest: but I will not bear Its penalty alone. Your guilty plots I come to disappoint.âMiscreant, dost thou Render me such a recompense?âAnd thou, With thy feign'd virtue ... Rom. Keep them all for him, Those names appropriate to himself alone: He is the sole delinquent; he the traitor, He the dissembling liar; he maintains With thee such faith as thou deservest; such As should the guilty with the guilty keep. I the delinquent am not; he suborned me, With base contrivances, to hear his words ... Al. I will myself, since thou hast learn'd a part, Divulge the whole to thee. I love, adore Romilda; nor is this a flame at which I need to blush. Seek in thyself, and thou The conscious reason speedily wilt find, Whence thou hast not my love, as thou pretendest. I, not for crimes design'd, could I e'er love Her who seduced me to them? Space immense Betwixt Rosmunda and Romilda lies; Thou feel'st that it is so. I love Romilda, And traitresses abhor. In what perdition Thy fierce and haughty vengeance can o'erwhelm me, I know already; yes, thou art to me But too completely known! Ah, could I thus, As I have slain her father, could I die! Could I appease Romilda's just disdain Expiring! Ah, that I had never been To thee a husband! That I were not now A traitor and a regicide! and then Romilda had not had her heart so closed Against my love. Rom. I! I should hate thee still, Not the assassin of my sire, not girt With his ill-gotten crown, and not espoused To a fierce step-mother. Far greater merit, Far greater than thy own, far nobler heart, Do I require to make me hear of love. E'en as my murder'd father renders thee To me abominate, so much and more, Thy wife betray'd, though such a wife she be, Makes thee in my esteem contemptible. Renown'd by her means, your united guilt, That blood which thou hast spill'd, should have joined thee To her in everlasting fellowship. I cannot, even in my own behalf, Treason endure; how much less then can I Endure a traitor! In my breast I bear Another flame more noble, whence my face Is not discolour'd with the blush of shame. I am prepared to die, but not prepared, No, never, never to resign my love. Al. Thou lovest? Rom. Ildovaldo. Al. This indeed, This is indeed the blow that quite unmans me. Ros. Speakst thou the truth, or dost thou still deceive me? Dost thou love Ildovaldo? Rom. I adore him With such affection as not e'en in thought Ye can conceive, much less then feel in heart: We are not for participated crimes Scourged with remorseful visitings; our souls Unspotted, 'twixt each other have no strife Save that of which shall love the other best. To him those mournful days, those days in which I have perchance unluckily survived My murder'd sire, to him I consecrate: To me his life, his lofty fame, his sword, His sword invincible, he consecrates. But should our life be cheated of its objects; Should we of all deliverance, all revenge Be disappointed, yet e'en then were we Eternally less desolate than you. Death were our refuge then, and unsubdued Shall we obtain it; for to abject minds The noble never yield: exultingly Shall we embrace him since betwixt us shared, From penitence and from reproaches free, From terror and remorse; and finally We shall obtain a death a thousand times More sweet than your appalled, degraded lives. Ros. Enough; depart. Thou soon shalt know thy fate. SCENE THE THIRD. Rosmunda, Almachilde. Ros. Perfidious, infamous, disloyal, perjured!â At last without constraint, I may pour out On thee my curses. Dost thou love another? ... But heaven hath well ordain'd; and such return Awaits thy passion as that passion merits. Oh joy ineffable! For who could bear, Who, save myself, the love of such a miscreant? Almost Romilda hath my fondness won Since I have heard her speak to thee. Oh why, As much as she does, cannot I detest thee? To me dost thou return such recompense, To whom thou ow'st so much?âTo me, oh vile! Who even from the throne to thee have stoop'd? Now answer me ... but what canst thou adduce That may extenuate thy turpitude? Al. Extenuate! Delinquents always seek, And seldom find, a plausible excuse. But to love virtue such as never heaven Lodged in a lady's bosom, I account A glory, and no crime. Ros. Dost thou then add Insult to perfidy? Al. Thou dost esteem All homage that to virtue is awarded An insult to thyself; I know it well; But what of that? Where I discover worth, Should I, on this account, admire it less? Romilda hates me; this I've heard too clearly; And with a fresh wound hath she pierced my heart. Hence in myself a sorrow do I feel Surpassing every sorrow. To the winds I know my sighs are scatter'd; all my hopes Are baffled and betray'd: yet not for this Can I e'er cease to love her!âThou canst not Reproach my want of faith, who knowest well Where, how, and wherefore I on thee bestow'd it. Thou, who know'st well that thou didst there constrain me Death to receive or give; that thou didst arm My wavering right-hand with the murderous sword: Dost recollect? and there, 'mid tears and treason, Darkness and blood, didst thou, exacting love, Swear love to me; but say, does love permit Her oaths to be exchanged where foul revenge Her altars has erected? That I there Was criminal I cannot contradict. But couldst thou, lady, e'er esteem the faith Required, and given, at such a horrible time, The genuine offspring of a lasting love? Ros. Yes; I deceived myself: I should have known That never is the bosom of a traitor With one perfidious action satisfied. 'Twould have been wiser to have avail'd myself For my revenge, of thy imperfect courage, And afterwards, by immolating him That slew his circumvented king, have sought To appease that murdered king's vindictive shade. This was the recompense befitting thee; Not my right-hand; not my imperial bed; Not a participation of my throne; Not of my heart. Al. Illustrious penitence! Thou art indeed Rosmunda.âWhy not now That which thou didst not perfectly perform, Accomplish utterly? Send forth thy spies; Another Almachilde fix upon (There will not such be wanting;) let him quickly Make me the counterpart of thy first lord: And in the blood of me, thy second spouse, Tell him to cleanse thy matrimonial sword, Still reeking with my predecessor's gore. Not for betraying thee, that were no crime, For having served thee, a far greater fault, I merit, and expect such recompense. But while the heavens still keep it dubious Which of us two shall first the other punish, I, by the shade of murdered Alboino, Swear, that Romilda of thy violence Shall not be victim. Meanwhile let us try, Myself, and Ildovaldo, which of her Can prove ourselves most worthy; which most burns With ardent fondness; which in enterprise Is most intrepid; to obtain her, which, To danger and to death, most dauntlessly Will bid defiance. SCENE THE FOURTH. Rosmunda. Ros. What canst thou accomplish?â Who ever saw such mad temerity?â But yet what can he not effect, since I Have dared myself all military power In him to lodge? ... To thee am I then known, E'en as I am? No, no, thou know'st me not, Not half my power thou know'st.âAnd I have loved thee? ... That love is at an end, and thou shall see it.â Rage, hatred, jealousy, and frantic passion, And haughty contumely, my bosom quit; Ye mixed and contradictory desires Evacuate my heart: and thou, revenge, Return, return, and make me wholly thine; Fill me with all thy influence; if I Have evermore accounted thee my first And only deity!âBut do I spend My time and rage in inefficient words? Rather should I anticipate his schemes, And frustrate all his impious machinations ... Whom do I see? SCENE THE FIFTH. Rosmunda, Ildovaldo. Ros. Here have the heavens themselves Sent thee to me; come, Ildovaldo, come, The avenger of my wrongs; the minister Of thy eternal joy, and my revenge, I hope, at once, to make thee. By Romilda, Loving, thou'rt loved; I know the whole, nor blame it; But transport inexpressible from thence Rather derive. But thou dost not yet know That the perfidious Almachilde, he For whom thou hast such difficulties braved, For whom, to-day, confronted death and dangers, That very Almachilde, to thyself Ungrateful, and to me perfidious, Himself Romilda loves. Il. Ah, miscreant! He by my hand shall die. Ros. Nor doth he love her With lukewarm passion; no; for he betrays For her each sacred duty; stands prepared For violence the most extravagant: He boasts of this excess, and I believe him. 'Tis true Romilda hates him fervently; 'Tis true that she, this instant, swore to him Eternal hate; and, in my presence, swore, At the same time, to thee eternal love; For thy sake, she profess'd that death seemed easy ... But Almachilde, though he heard her words, Was not discouraged. Rather he derives From every obstacle a fresh incentive.â Who will restrain him if thou dost not do it? I hope to find in thy persisting ardour A prevalent hindrance to his base desires: This to thyself thou owest; and to this Do my commands excite thee.âI desist From every other project for Romilda; She is no longer Alaric's, but thine; I will that she be thine. My ancient hate Yields to this more engrossing enmity; May she with thee be happy; take her thou; And from my eyes eternally remove her. Il. Is then Romilda mine? Exquisite joy! Whence could I not with this arm rescue her? ... Is she then mine?âBut who meanwhile fulfils My unaccomplished vengeance? Ros. Go, collect Thy faithful partizans; arm them forthwith; Menace, deceive, use force: at all events Rescue thy lady from the miscreant's hands; But leave to my discretion final vengeance. First let the guilty traitor see his prey Snatched from his grasp; first in his rival's arms Let him behold her placed; and at the sight Let him despair, and impotently chafe ... Il. What? Is Romilda in his arms already? Ros. He is forestall'd; yet is he not less bold, Nor less a lover than thyself ... Il. He is In all things my inferior. Ros. Thou shouldst then Prevent him, and delude him. To thy choice I leave all projects; I would not expose Thy passion to a dubious issue. Il. Fraud Is irksome to me; for in fraud alone Could Almachilde conquer me. Meanwhile Watch thou o'er him; I to the camp repair, There arm my forces, and, ere it be long, Return here to Romilda. Ros. Quick; dispatch; Reflect on all things, and for all provide; And be alike in mind and body arm'd: Thou'rt a true lover. Go, fly hence, return. SCENE THE SIXTH. Rosmunda. Ros. Meanwhile my measures I will here adopt.â But shall I make her happy in her love Whom I abhor? Happy?âThou art not yet so: And I yet live.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Romilda, Ildovaldo. Rom. I've seen Rosmunda. Can I now believe? ... Il. All is at length disposed: thou'rt safe already, Provided that thou wilt at fall of night To me repair. Scarce from the fatal walls Shall we have parted, ere we shall discover A guard of chosen champions: afterwards All obstacles will vanish with our progress. Rom. Oh thou, my true defender! Who indeed Could have imagined this? Where I expected Death, as the least of ills, shall I receive Life and enjoyment from the same Rosmunda? Say, should my bosom welcome such a hope? We, who were erewhile in the depths of woe, Are, in a space incalculably swift, Raised to the pinnacle of happiness? I join'd to thee? I free? exempt from danger? ... Can this be true? Il. That I should rescue thee I was convinced, but in a different manner: Yet this involves less danger to ourselves. In this Rosmunda doth befriend herself, E'en more than us; she is compell'd to do it. It grieves me, for the present, to be forced To drag thee from thy kingdom; but, in safety Provided that I see thee, hopes I cherish To reconduct thee in another fashion One day to thy hereditary realm. Rom. Where'er with thee I am my kingdom lies. Hence I've such transports that all seems unreal ... But yet such ecstacy scarce counteracts The new forebodings that assault my heart. The traitor Almachilde is my lover; I have not merited his impious love; All unexpected to my innocent ears It came; but yet I heard it; nor in him ... Il. I should have understood that miscreant better: But for my gifts I swear I will exact A recompense; the victory, the realm, His life that I defended with my blood, He shall repay to me. But, for the present, I ought to shun him, and I will, while thou Art not in safety. Rom. Ah! thou canst not know What agonizing wounds my heart sustain'd In hearing his base words! How all at once I seem'd less worthy in my own esteem, Since I had pleased a nature so ignoble! Oh how I hate him!âBut Rosmunda is The origin of all my wretchedness; She has oppress'd and laden me with insults, And evermore degraded me. I feel An inauspicious presage in my heart That she will never, never prove to me The instrument of safety; I know well The infinite abhorrence, which, in her, By her ferocity, her deadly crimes, And rankling jealousy, is now redoubled. But all, whate'er they be, all the effects Of her wild passions, as a lesser ill I rather chuse to bear, than the base love And insolent addresses of her minion. Il. His foolish hardihood shall cost him dear: Appease thyself; it was no crime of thine That thou didst hear him. Rom. I, but for one moment, Should ne'er have seem'd accessible to him; Behold my fault; should never have endured That he for my misfortunes dared to seem Impress'd with pity; never should have made him The witness of my tears; a joy by me To proud Rosmunda evermore denied. Often my eyes with tear-drops ill suppress'd, My heart with sorrow fill'd, the miscreant saw; Hence rose his boldness; ... hence my guilt arose; And a disgrace I ever must deplore. ... Il. To make thee e'en exult in this, leave me; And him in tears of blood to weep his crime. To him who never blamed thee yet, Romilda, One look of thine, in which thy innocent soul, And thy most pure and ardent heart, shine forth, More than exculpates thee.âLet this suffice. Be thou here ready at the approach of night To follow me; of nothing else take thought. Meanwhile the sight of Almachilde shun; Thus his suspicious wilt thou best defeat. Rosmunda equally do thou avoid, For she, perchance ... Rom. I understand thee well; Lest in her bosom for a pitying deed Remorse arise. Il. Farewell. A longer stay Our projects may defeat. Rom. Dost thou then leave me? Il. Ere long, and never more shall we be severed. SCENE THE SECOND. Almachilde, Romilda, Ildovaldo, Soldiers. Al. Oh stop! Rom. Oh Heaven! Il. Who brings thee here before me? Rom. Circled by soldiers! ... Al. Whither dost thou fly? Oh stop. Much have I to impart to thee. I do not come, although I have the power, By violence to restrain thee. In the camp Thou hast, by stealth, arm'd thy most faithful followers: Tell me the cause? Perchance, on the same day Thou wouldst defend thy monarch and betray him. Il. That I defended thee no more recall; This is the only stigma on my honour; Do not remember it: if no one else Can wash it out, assuredly canst thou By such a recompense as thou hast given. Rom. Traitor, dar'st thou, where I am, come in arms, And feign conciliatory purposes? Al. No, no, I do not feign. Since I have tried With words in vain, 'tis needful now with deeds That I should prove to thee my love. Il. Thou wretch ... Rom. And dar'st thou yet? ... Al. If 'tis your will, ye hear From me no more the language of a king: But if ye do refuse, ye shall be forced To hear my words. The time is now gone by For me to moderate my fatal love: In vain I will'd it, and in vain ye hope it. I scorn to have recourse, for thy possession, To circumventive stratagems; yet never, That others by such means should win thy charms Will I endure. Thou mean'st to drag her hence; This seems to me unworthy of thy valour; Pursue a wiser plan; I am prepared, I swear to thee, beneath my kingly power To seek no refuge. Il. If thou dost not make Thy ill-gain'd power a refuge from my rage, Say, as a refuge from what danger then? What lying pomp of noble sentiments Dar'st thou assume, while here on every side Begirt with armed satellites? Al. 'Tis true I keep these at my side, lest thou shouldst not Consent at present to appear my equal. These are a monarch's train; this likewise is A warrior's sword; the sword alone I keep; These, if thou fear'st not, at one nod of mine Shall disappear. Bestir thyself: to thee I give the challenge: let Romilda be The guerdon of the most successful valour. Il. Do thou then die beneath this hand of mine! .. Rom. Your swords! ... oh heavens! ... why are ye thus outrageous? Cease, Ildovaldo; does he merit, think'st thou, That thou shouldst join with him in single combat? Il. Thou speakest truth. To what indignity, Heated with rage, would I demean myself! Rom. Canst thou endure the look of Ildovaldo, Much less the opposition of his sword? And if untoward fate to thee should yield The palm of victory, dost thou fondly think That I should e'er be thine? Dost thou not know That I love Ildovaldo more than life, And that I hate thee more than I love him? Il. Should he, then, most a veteran in arms, Or most a veteran in treachery, gain her? Al. What? While I make myself thy equal; while I hold myself in readiness to fight For that which I could wrest from thee, thou dar'st To a magnanimous challenge make reply With taunting words?âThou wilt not be my equal? Then thou art not so: then to-day, I ought, As fitting from the greater to the less, Thy insolence to punish. First by right, And afterwards by every other means, If thou compel me to them, have I fix'd To gain my purpose. On no terms will I Romilda yield to thee. I loved her first: The outrage which my right-hand did to her, My right-hand only can repair once more: I can avenge her: to her ancient rights, To all her lost possessions, can restore her; I can do this; and this thou canst not do, Nor any one but me. Rom. It is most true; Thou canst add perfidy to perfidy, And thou alone canst do it. Traitor, go: Wert thou ungrateful only to thy wife, More than enough e'en that would be to make thee Detestable to me. I heed not death: What do I say? far rather would I go A certain sacrifice to Alaric; Far rather here remain a slave, exposed To the dire malice of my cruel step-mother, Than e'er as my defender suffer thee. Il. And I profess to thee, that never thou Didst a more deep opprobrium cast on me Than in the attempt to make thyself my equal. Thou hast not with this foolish love of thine As yet offended me. Art thou, perchance, A rival to be fear'd, except, indeed, The prize disputed be Rosmunda's love? And she is verily thy counterpart.â Nor doth thy dark ingratitude inflict A deeper wound: in this I recognise In thee a real king.âBy hands most vile Be my head severed from my lifeless trunk On the dire scaffold; but to single combat No longer challenge me; in doing this Thou dost alone offend me. Have I stain'd My sword, as thou hast, with nocturnal blood, So that I could, exempted from dishonour, With thy sword measure it? Al. Enough, enough. Save with thy tongue thou wilt not combat? wilt not Receive me as thy rival? As thy king Thou shalt receive me then.âArrest him, soldiers. Rom. Ah! no ... Il. Vile sword, that didst defend a tyrant, Lie on the earth. My hand, and not another's, Shall strip me of my arms ... Rom. Your leader bound In fetters! Ah, vile sycophants! ... now hear me; Suspend ... perhaps I ... Oh horrible state! ... Oh hear me ... Il. What art thou doing? Wherefore pray'st thou thus?â I love thee; and thou lov'st me in return. What cause have we to fear? Al. Without delay From my sight drag him. Il. My sole punishment Arises from thy presence. Let us go.â Provided that I never more should see thee, At once I leave to thee my last farewell, Beloved Romilda, and the solemn vow Of love eternal, e'en beyond the tomb. SCENE THE THIRD. Romilda, Almachilde. Rom. Ah! let me fall exhausted at thy side ... I will pursue him ... Wretch, dost thou prevent me? At all events ... Al. Ah! hinder not, that I, A little while at least, detain thee here. Rom. Oh rage! oh grief! ... Permit me at his side ... Al. Hear me. Rom. Too much already have I heard thee ... My lover ... Al. Thou canst not pursue him now; ... But fear not: I, for liberty and life, Spite of my wishes, for thyself, perchance, Preserve him yet. In a dark dungeon he Shall never be immured; nor shall endure, I swear, from my hands any misery. I well remember yet, that by his means I am alive to-day: he hath sustain'd Transient coercion. But ... oh Heaven! ... to suffer Another thus to seize my only good On earth, thy precious presence ... Rom. Yet of love? ... Ah, why have I not here a sword to free me From thy unwelcome words! Al. Ah! pardon me; I will not utter more. I hope, in short, Amply to rescue from this transient wrong Thy lover, (envied name!) and hope, at once, Of what I owe him to discharge myself. Rom. Dost feign humanity? So much art thou More in mine eyes an object of abhorrence. What canst thou give? what debt canst thou repay? Restore our liberty; and never more Molest our presence, never; the sole gift Is this, which thou canst yield to me. Al. Oh never Can I surrender thee to any one: But, spite of thy consent, I may obtain thee. Rom. I think it not: and shall that ever happen While I've a dagger to defend myself? To cheat me, or to wrest me from my purpose, In vain thou hopest. One with Ildovaldo ... Al. Of him, of me, and of thyself, the mistress I wish to see thee: in my bosom, fraud I harbour not. Only prevent not thou That I exert myself for thee. If I Already have bereft thee of thy father, And neither tears nor penitence to thee Once more can bring him back; I will to-day, Aught else of which thou hast been robb'd, restore. Rosmunda is an everlasting blot To my good fame: in seeing her alone I feel the incurable and festering wound Of dire remorse, within my heart become More insupportable from day to day: The bed, the throne, the love of such a woman, (While I am doomed to share them,) render me More guilty in the eyes of other men, And in my own more vile. The time is come ... Rom. The time for what? ... Speak; speak ... Oh, worthy thou, Worthy Rosmunda, nay, far worse than she, Thou wouldst, perchance, at a command of mine Thyself destroy her? Now, thou miscreant, know, That most intensely as I do detest her, I rather would on thee, than her, obtain Meet retribution. True it is, the death Of my ill-fated father was, at first, The project of Rosmunda; but the wretch Who dared to perpetrate it, who was he?â Go; for I well perceive, by thy discourse, That no great stress of words were needful now To goad thee on to new enormities. Al. I have committed one; but, in my mind, More than one great and expiatory deed Do I revolve; and it shall be the first To disencumber my unworthy brows Of this unlawful crown, and give it thee, For it is due to thee; whate'er the risk, Thy champion, the defender of thy rights To make myself, beneath thy feet to lay Prostrate the pride (and be it whom it may) Of thy oppressor: afterwards, when safe I shall behold thee on the throne, e'en then Of all thy vassals to profess myself The most submissive, the most culpable, And the most reverential; then to hear My final sentence from thy lips; to see (Ah sight of woe!) enthroned, and at thy side Thy Ildovaldo, my liege sovereign: And drag, so long as it seems good to thee, In desolation my opprobrious days, The laughing-stock of all; and 'mid such woe Retain no other solace in the world Than that of seeing thee: a crime not mine, As far as in me lies, by means like these, I shall have expiated ... Rom. Cease, oh cease. I do not at thy hands require a throne: Restore to me my lover, he is mine More than the throne is mine, and more I prize him. If thou deny this, thou shalt see me fall By my own hands. Al. Thy lover then shall be To me the surety of thy life. I swear I will inflict on him the direst tortures If thou lay'st violent hands upon thyself. Take heed: ... With too much fervency e'en now I hate my rival ... in my breast I bear A rage too desperate; do not add, I pray thee, Fury, to fury too intense already ... I ask no other boon, than leave to act An humble instrument in thy behalf; And at the expense of my eternal woe, To make thee fortunate in thy allotment. And what reward do I require? Towards me Somewhat to mitigate thy fierce aversion, And somewhat my own infamy. And this, Whether thou wilt or not, I will perform. I fly to consummate my purposes. Ah! perhaps my deeds may be more prevalent To soften thy aversion than my words. Meanwhile I yield thee time for meditation ... My baseness thou alone canst verify, By persevering to esteem me base. SCENE THE FOURTH. Romilda. Rom. Ah wretched me! ... What evils does he threaten? To what do hatred and my rage impel me? He in his fetters holds my love: I will Save him, whate'er the risk ... Wretch that I am! I am compell'd to feign with this fell monster ... Oh Heaven! if he deluded me? I freeze ... I tremble ... Ildovaldo in the power Of an offended rival; thou hast not A sword, with which illustriously to die ... Nor can I give thee one ... what should I do? To whom recur for aid? ... SCENE THE FIFTH. Rosmunda, Romilda. Ros. Where is the traitor? With thee erewhile he here held conference: .. Where has he flown? Rom. Now hear ... Ros. I have heard all. In guilty fetters Ildovaldo groans. Where, where is he, that in my palace thus Usurps the royal power? Perfidious woman, He was erewhile with thee ... Rom. Ah! do thou hear me. Yet thou know'st not the whole; his impious views Thou hast not yet discover'd: to myself Is ill applied the stigma of perfidious. But yet deem me perfidious still, if that In any wise can solace thee; and make An exhibition cruel as thou canst Of my devoted person: but only now From his accursed hands, without delay, Wrest Ildovaldo; thence ... Ros. Thou shalt behold That I will wrest him quickly. Rom. May just Heaven, If thou dost this, be to thy reign propitious; And may the calm shade of my murder'd father No more thy nights disturb; may the new villain That thou hast foster'd at thy side, alone Fall victim of his own atrocity! But if 'twould be a task too difficult To loose my faithful lover's impious chains, At least allow, that in his dungeon he Obtain a sword, by which to free himself From the fierce rancour of a cruel rival. And at the same time grant, ere he expire, That he may learn that I defied all force; That in myself secure, worthy of him, I by no hands, except my own, here fell Transfix'd; and here, invoking his loved name, Breathed forth my latest sigh. Ros. Lov'st thou so well? And is thy love so fervently return'd? Oh rage! ... and I ... Be pacified; ere long Thou shalt behold thy lover disenthrall'd; ... Go ... and my presence carefully avoid: Amply on me art thou avenged already; I am most wretched, and am I compell'd To make thee happy ... thee? Rom. Although thy rage Alone dispose thee to espouse my cause, On that account I shall not be less grateful; Nor will I hide from thee the precipice Towards which thou art impell'd. Madden'd with love, The ungrateful Almachilde would at once From thee thy sceptre and thy freedom wrest, Perhaps take thy life away: and further dares To tempt me with the infamous reversion Of these abominable gifts. Ros. 'Tis thou, Thou vile enchantress, that hast thus seduced him. Rom. Then murder me; and save, without delay, My Ildovaldo only ... Ros. For thy sake Is such commotion raised? Ah! who art thou? Are thy deserts so great? Thou liest. Oh rage! And am I doom'd from thy lips to receive This horrid secret? ... Must I then by thee Be saved? If to thy vows the heavens be kind, Go thou so far from me that I no more Tidings of thee may hear: Oh never, never, May I behold thee happy ... Hence ... away! ... Rom. But ... Ros. Didst thou hear me? SCENE THE SIXTH. Rosmunda. Ros. Oh despair! oh death! And am I then, am I, compell'd to fly To loose, myself, her lover from his chains?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Rosmunda, Almachilde, Soldiers. Ros. To the camp goest thou? Al. But I shall thence ... Return ... Ros. And I expect thee from the camp A conqueror here: here keep for thee thy victims. Al. Time now is wanting to reply to thee. First would I shew myself to Ildovaldo. Ros. Go, fly, and fight: I have myself unloosed His fetters. Thou, erewhile, in single combat Didst wish to encounter him: but if his hands With chains were laden, how could he resist thee? Released, already he expects thee; run To triumph over him. Al. Thy trait'rous arts, My rival, and the disaffected camp, All equally I scorn. At length, for once, Thou hast afforded me a valid reason, Whence with good right I may appear to thee A foe avowed: irrevocably now Thou hast released me from thy interests. Ros. Go Conquer, return; and menace afterwards. Al. I shall be victor; Heaven supports my cause: Who, if I fall, remains to punish thee! SCENE THE SECOND. Rosmunda. Ros. Go, go; in Ildovaldo's rage and valour Far more do I confide. Miscreant, I grieve That I have chosen for thy punishment A far too honourable hand. But what? Say, is that punishment accomplish'd yet? The issue yet is dubious: and there want not, Although the men of valour are the friends Of Ildovaldo, base adventurers Who, averse to him, for their private views, Still to the king adhere. This impious man Has still a multitude of partizans; And from the infatuation of his love Are force and hardihood in him increased ... Oh Heaven! should fortune favour his designs, Always propitious to the criminal? ... Ah! let me not delay ... Blind confidence Might now be detrimental. Speedily, Guards, drag Romilda hither. From my side Let her not e'en the distance of one step Be sever'd now. Oh, precious pledge of peace! Oh most preposterous origin of discord! Is she the royal guerdon of the victor?â If she indeed a royal guerdon be, Let her come here; to give her is my province. SCENE THE THIRD. Rosmunda, Romilda. Ros. Advance, advance, incomparable virgin; Come; and securely in my sight remain, While war is waged for thee in yonder camp. Come near, approach ... Thou tremblest? Rom. Merciful Heaven! Around the city horrid shrieks are heard, And seem advancing towards the palace gates ... But, ah! with what new fury do I see Thy troubled countenance inflamed? ... no more Is it allowed to me to hope for joy ... Only that Ildovaldo is released ... Ah! may he yet be living! ... I beseech thee From such a doubt deliver me. Ros. From doubt Deliver thee, while I myself exist In deadly doubt? Ah, mayest thou for ever Drag on a life as horrible and wretched As these wild hours, by thy means, are to me! For thee all rush to arms; a second Helen! A prize unparallel'd! For thee are shed Rivers of blood to-day: husbands for thee Are perjured: cowards for thy sake are valiant, And haughty the dispirited.âOh thou, The arbitress of heroes, hither come; Sit by my side in queen-like majesty; Now in the camp is battle waged for thee, That thou mayst have a throne ... or death. Rom. And what? Wouldst thou deride me still?âart thou not yet With such unnumber'd insults satisfied? Ros. What sayst thou? I alone am here derided: Of all my fury, of the just revenge That I against thee cherish, of my deep Immitigable jealousy, art thou Prepared to reap the precious fruits: 'tis I That crown thee with supreme contentment; I That place thee in thy wish'd-for lover's arms. Thou seest in such a tempest of my heart What small alleviation words afford. Me, me thou mockest, and with too just cause.â I've burst the fetters of thy Ildovaldo; And his invincible right hand have arm'd Already with the sword; he now fulfils My just revenge; and while fulfilling mine, Thine, thine a thousand fold he consummates. Rom. Oh may at least that arm invincible Be now triumphant! Thus thou canst alone Cancel the stigma of thy former crime. Yes, now a ray of hope illumes my prospect, Since in the camp, released from shameful fetters, My Ildovaldo stands. Ah! may the heavens Grant thee a life less turbid ... Ros. I survive To drag along a horrible existence, Whate'er the event. Do thou enjoy my grief; Already over thine have I exulted; Enjoy that grief since I forbid thee not ... But perhaps ... What prayers shall I put up to heaven? ... I am bewilder'd ... Hitherto I know My supplications have all been for blood; Yet do I see no blood that can appease me ... And shall another where I'm cursed be happy?â Soon shall we see ... But who approaches here? ... Rom. A little armed band ... And Ildovaldo Is at their head. Oh joy! .. SCENE THE FOURTH. Romilda, Ildovaldo, Rosmunda. The Followers of Ildovaldo. Rom. Ah! come art thou Victorious?âam I thine? Ros. Hast thou fulfill'd The task that I enjoin'd? Hast thou destroyed That traitor? Il. I? He is not for my sword A worthy victim. Almachilde fights Uselessly in the camp: I have imposed The task on other faithful partizans To conquer him; an easy task to them. Not to a warrior's sword, to a vile axe His life is due. On thee I thought alone. Romilda; and have consecrated first To thee this sword. Come; let me lead thee now From these abominable walls. My heroes Are competent to clear for thee a passage. Come with me, thou art truly mine at length. Ros. Stop: she is not yet thine: I bid thee stop: I should bestow her with my hand. Romilda, Thou art mine only while I hold thee here; And hence thou shalt not stir. And thou, oh coward, When I release thee from thy chains, and promise Whate'er thou wishest in the world, to give thee, Recreant, dost thou refuse to serve my fury? Thou shunn'st, instead of murdering, thy rival? For an unmerited reward, while he Is living, com'st thou here? Rom. Oh from her hands Now drag me quickly, Ildovaldo. Il. Come, Cease, oh Rosmunda; loose her; 'tis in vain: Thou canst not now suffice to be a hindrance To her departure hence. Enough of foes Has Almachilde; in his recreant blood Others will not refuse to soil their hands. Be not perplex'd, Rosmunda. Ros. What!âDost thou Intend to cheat me? Rom. Loose me ... Il. Yield, or I ... Ros. I loose thee? no, no, never.âBut already I hear approaching shouts ... fierce and more fierce, And nearer they approach ... Oh joy to me, If thus perchance thy hope may be deceived! Rom. Alas, alas! Il. Who comes thus arm'd? Ros. Oh joy! See Almachilde: I perceive he's victor: And he, I hope, will punish thee. SCENE THE FIFTH. Almachilde, Ildovaldo, Rosmunda, Romilda, Soldiers, and Followers of Ildovaldo. Il. Com'st thou In quest of me perchance? Behold me ... Al. Check, My heroes, check your swords: we have atchieved Enough of slaughter. Let us now desist From further violence. Il. It yet remains For thee to murder me: but first ... Ros. Dispatch him. Al. Hear me, strong Ildovaldo, hear, Romilda. Retreat from hence, ye soldiers; I command it. Here all whom I have sought I meet at once. Thou seest, Ildovaldo, vainly now Wouldst thou defend thyself against my power. To every individual of thy train I can at least oppose an hundred here. Thou hast to-day my life preserved; to-day Life I give thee. More thou deservest not. I will that thou, Romilda, be alone The arbitress of thy own destiny; The sovereign of ourselves, and of that woman. Thou seest now clearly whether I have sought To plot against thee. Ros. She my sovereign! Mine!âIn her breast I plunge at once this dagger ... Il. Ah! stop ... Al. Desist ... Ros. Let no one dare approach, Or I at once the dagger plunge. Rom. And plunge it: Thus Ildovaldo's I at least shall die ... Ros. Now, which of us is sovereign here? Al. Thou ... thou .. Ah, cease ... Il. Oh heaven! ... Distraction ... Oh Romilda! And cannot I deliver thee? ... Ros. Oh thou In name alone a king, that sword surrender. Al. Behold me weaponless ... Ros. From forth the palace Dismiss now all thy soldiers ... Al. Go, disperse, Make haste, all, all ... Ros. And thou who didst refuse, Cold lover, with a crime to acquire thy mistress, Dismiss thy troops at once. Il. See, they are vanished. Ros. So far well done.âRagauso, instantly Hither return, and all my armed guards ... Al. Come, come, ah quickly, come ... Ros. Behold Ragauso.â âI am, yet I am here then, queen? Al. Thou art, Thou only. Ah! .. Il. Accomplish thy revenge On which of us thou first wouldst immolate ... But oh Romilda! ... Wouldst thou I should die? ... Behold I turn the sword against my breast ... Ros. My fury cannot even in your blood Be now appeased. When I commanded it Thou shouldest then have aim'd the mortal blow: Thou knewest well what blood from thee I sought. But yet, in time, do I repent that I To thee, base recreant, such a vengeance trusted; Or ever placed a confidence in thee, Poor perjured palterer.âBut wholly now, In my own keeping, chastisement I hold; So that I venture to promulgate it Without reserve.âOh thou, in whom are centred All my aversions, who so well as thou Their ravening turbulence canst satiate?
