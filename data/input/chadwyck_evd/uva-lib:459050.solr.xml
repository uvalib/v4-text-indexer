      <field name="fulltext">LVMINALIA, OR The Festivall of Light. Personated in a Masque at Court, By the Queenes Majestie, and her Ladies. On Shrovetuesday Night, 1637.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The names of the Masquers. The Queenes Majestie. Duchesse of Lenox. Countesse of Southampton Countesse of Newport. Lady Katherine Howard. Lady Dorothy Sidney. Lady Elizabeth Fielding. Mr s. Victoria Cary. Countesse of Oxford. Countesse of Carnarvan. Countesse of Portland. Lady Elizabeth Cecil. Lady Rich. Lady Frances Howard. Mr s. Nevill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Kings Majesties Masque being performed, the Queene commanded Inigo Iones Surveyor of her Majesties works, to make a new subject of a Masque for her selfe, that with high and hearty invention, might give occasion for variety of Scenes, strange aparitions, Songs, Musick and dancing of severall kinds; from whence doth result the true pleasure peculiar to our English Masques, which by strangers and travellers of judgement, are held to be as noble and ingenious, as those of any other nations: This being suddainly done and shewed her Majestie, and shee approving it, the worke was set in hand, and with all celerity performed in shorter time, than any thing here hath beene done in this kind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The invention consisting of darknesse and light, the night presents the first Antimasques and sleepe with his three principall children, the Antimasques of dreams: The subject of the maine Masque of light, was thus introduc'd. The Muses being long since drawne out of Greece by the fierce Thratians, their groves withered and all their springs dryed up, and out of Italy by the barbarous Goths and vandals, they wandred here and there indecently without their ornaments and instruments: The Arch-Flamines and Flamines their Prophetick Priests being constrained either to live in disguises, or hide their heads in caves, and in some places, whensoever they began to appeare, they were together with peace driven out by warre, and in the more civiliz'd parts, where they hop'd to have taken some rest, envy and avarice by clipping the wings of Fame drave them into a perpetuall storme, till by the divine mindes of these incomparable Paire, the Muses and they were received into protection, and establisht in this monarchy, to the incouragement and security of those well-borne wits represented by the Prophetick Priests of the Britanides. The Scene where this goddesse of brightnesse was discovered, was stiled the garden of the Britanides, or Muses of great Brittaine, not inferiour in beautie to that of the Hesperides, or that of Alcinous, celebrated by Homer. The conclusion of all was an applause and confirmation of those Deities or second causes by whose influence at this prefixed time, the Britanides and their Prophetick Priests were to be establisht in this garden, by the unanimous and magnificent vertues of the King and Queens Majesties making this happy Island a patterne to all Nations, as Greece was amongst the Ancients. The ornament which serv'd as a Bordure to enclose the Scene, was raised on two round Basements, on which were Satyres bigger than the life, bearing baskets of fruits, and knots of young Satyres clinging about their leggs in extravagant postures: above these ran comicements, which made the ground of a second order, wherein were termes of women fained of silver, and children in their naturall colours standing on arches, some wantonising about those termes, and others holding great vizards before their faces: On the heads of the Termes were cushions which served for capitals, that bore the finishing of composed frontispices of great scrowles with frutages, from whence hung lighted Lamps. In the Freeze above was other young Satyres, which seem'd oppress'd with the burthen of great festons, the husks of which were tied up in knots to a double compartiment composed of scrowles, quadratures, and Masque heads, in the midst hung a drapery fained, of cloth of silver, and in it was written LVMINALIA: under all this ranne a large valens of gold embroidered with flowers and great Tassels. The Kings Majestie being seated under the State, the curtaine in an instant disappear'd discovering a Scene all of darknesse, the neerer part woody, and farther off more open with a calme River, that tooke the shadowes of the Trees by the light of the Moone, that appear'd shining in the River; there being no more light to lighten the whole Scene than served to distinguish the severall grounds, that seemed to run farre in from the eye, with this Scene of darknesse was heard the voyces of Birds of Night. This strange Scene having a while entertained the sight of the spectators, there arose out of the hollow caverns of the earth a duskie cloud, and on it a Chariot enricht and drawne by two great owles, on this sate a matron in a purple robe, with starres of gold and large black wings displaied, her browne haire loose, and on her head a vaile of russet cipresse, with a picked crowne and a golden Scepter in her hand; Representing night: she tels she came to give repose to the labours of mortals: but seing all things here tending to feasts and revels, shee with her attendants will give her assistance, though it serve but as a foile to set off more nobler representations. Nights first song. (1) In wet and cloudy mists, I sloowly rise, As with mine owne dull weight opprest To close with sleep the jealous lovers eyes, And give forsaken Virgins rest. (2) Th' adventrous Merchant and the Mariner, (Whom stormes all day vex in the deep) Beginne to trust the windes when I appeare, And lose their dangers in their sleep. (3) The studious that consume their brains and sight, In search where doubtfull knowledge lies, Grow wearie of their fruitlesse use of light, And wish my shades to ease their eyes. (4) Th'ambitious toyling Statesman that prepares Great mischiefes ere the day begins, Not measures day by houres, but by his cares; And night must intermit his sinnes. (5) Then why, when my slow Chariot us'd to clime, Did old mistaking Sages weepe? As if my Empire did usurpe their time, And houres were lost when spent in sleep. (6) I come to ease their labours and prevent That wearinesse which would destroy: The profit of their toyles are still miss-spent Till rest enables to enjoy. There came out from the sides of the Scene six persons, Oblivion, Silence, and the foure nocturnall houres or vigils, all attendants on the night. Oblivion a young man naked, and a greene mantle tucked about his shoulders, and upon his head a cuckoe. Silence an old man in a skin coat close to his body set full of eyes, his mantle tawny, and a girland of Peach-tree about his head. The first vigill in a robe of blue, with a red mantle, her haire hanging downe in locks, and a bat setting before. The second habited as the former, but the colours somwhat darker, on her head a scritch-owle. The third in purple, and black, on her head a dormouse. The fourth in watchet and carnation, her haire mixt with silver like dew, and a little Swan on her head, all these colours were appropriated to the severall nocturnall houres. The Chariot of Night being arrived to the middle of the aire, staid, and after some dialogue with her attendants, shee ascends singing, and is hidden in the clouds. Nights second song. Silence. Why dreadfull Queen dost thou appeare, So early in this Hemisphere? 1 Vigill. Where all to triumphs are addrest, As they did need as little rest As wandring Planets have above; Who ne're are tir'd, yet ever move. Oblivion. As little wearie as are they; As free from suff'rings and decay, Or feare of fleeting times expence; Not tir'd, with weight, or vex'd with sense. 1 Vigill. Why would Oblivion mix with these that strive, To raise new joyes, and keep the old alive? Vigill. What is the use of silence here? Thou see'st (great Empresse) ev'ry eie, Doth watch for measures, ev'ry eare Doth hearken after harmony. Chorus of all. Why are we come to give their labours ease? That reckon sleepe a death, rest a disease: And all this Isle their triumphs now expresse, Not to beget, but shew their happinesse: A precious signe, they know their owne estate, And that makes Nations chiefly fortunate: For it alike should often valued be, To know, as to deserve felicitie. The third song. (1) You just, and carefull Registers of houres, And you whose sev'rall ever usefull powers, Dispose and make me pleasing whilst I sway, Produce fantasticke creatures of the night, Though not t'advance, yet vary their delight; Perhaps these triumphs may defer the day. (2) All that our striving mistery presents Will be but foiles to nobler ornaments, Yet I so trust the causes of their joy, And am so envious of those glistring showes The Sunne in pride, not favour doth disclose, That I would lengthen what I can't destroy. Antimasques produced by the Attendants of Night. 1 Entry. 2 Theeves. 2 Watchmen. 1 Belman. The two Theeves enter to share a booty, the watchmen and Belman first affright them, as they are dividing their booty, but in the end they were contented to share with the Theeves, and so they all joined in a dance. 2 Entry. 1 Wafer-man, and 4 Lacquyes with torches. 3 Entry. Five Fayries, of which Master Ieffery Hudson, the Queenes Majesties dwarfe, presented Piecrocall a principall Captaine under King Auberon. 4 Entry. Coyners. Most of these Antimasques were presented by Gentlemen of Qualitie. These Antimasques being past, the scene of night vanished; and a new and strange Prospect of Chimeras appear'd, with some trees of an unusuall forme, Mountaines of gold, Towers falling, Windmils, and other extravagant edifices, and in the further part a great City sustain'd by a Rain-bow, all which represented the City of Sleepe. One of the Vigils in song called forth Sleepe, who appeared comming out of a darke cave, with three of his principall sonnes. Morpheus the presenter of humane shapes. Iceles, of fearfull visions. And Phantaste, of any thing that may be imagined. Sleepe, a fat man in a blacke robe, and over it a white mantle, on his head a girland of Grapes, with a Dormouse sitting before, in his hand a golden wand. Morpheus in a robe of cloth of gold, his mantle Blue, on his head a girland of Poppy. Iceles, in a brownish flesh colour close to him, like the naked, a red mantle, great Bats wings on his shoulders; on his head a bend set with flames. Phantaste, in a white robe of cloth of silver, a greene mantle, and on his head a dressing of severall coloured feathers. The fourth Song. 1. Vigill. Why (as if guilty) dost thou hide thy head (Dull sleepe!) in gloomy shades with Poppy spread? If thou dost steale our houres, is it a crime? Thou dost but lay them by for mens releefe, And art at worst a profitable theefe; Pay'st Nature double what thou steal'st from Time. Invoke thy chiefest sonnes, and straight appeare, To make these pleasures fit to last a yeare! Sleepe. I come! I come! and that I more may please, My Morpheus I have brought, and Iceles, With wilde Phantaste; each of them hath pow'r To raise Ideas from my shady Bow'r: Those dreames of humane formes; of worse estate That reason want, and things inanimate. Chorus. How we shall fill each mortall with delight, To shew the soules fond businesse ev'ry night; When she doth inwardly contract her beames, To figure out her influence in dreames! How they will smile, that mans immortall part, Works things lesse perfect than if rul'd by Art! The song ended, the sonnes of Sleepe bring in these Antimasques of dreames. 1 Entry. An Ignis Fatuus, leading 4. Clownes that seeme to walke in their sleepe. 2. Entry. 4. Witches. 1. Devill in the shape of a Goat. 3. Entry. Robin-goodfellow. 1. Dairy-maid. 1. Kitchin-maid. 4. Entry. Of five feathered men, inhabitants of the City of Sleepe. Presented by Master Thomas Howard. Master Henry Murrey. Master Charles Murrey. Master Charles Brunoe. Here an Antique ship was seene farre within the Scene, sailing in the aire. 5. Entry. From the Temple of the Cocke, seated by the haven of the City of Sleepe, the principall Mariners or Masters Mates in rich habits, but proper to the subject, come forth and make their entry. Presented by The Duke of Lenox. Earle of Carlile. Lord William Hamilton. Lord Russell. 6. Entrie. Five Sentinels guardians of the Ivorie gate of the Citie of Sleep: Presented by Earle of Devonshire, Lord Philip Herbert, M. De la Vieuville, Mr. Francis Russell, Mr. Thomas Weston. 7. Entrie. A cavilier in a dreame being enamord of a beautifull Gentlewoman, seeks by his Page to winne her to his love, which she seems to entertaine, but hee comming neere to court her, shee sodainly is turned into a furie, which much affri'ghts them. Represented by The Earle of Antrum, and Mr. Bartholomew de Mountacut his Page. These Antimasques being past, the Heaven began to bee enlightned as before the Sunne rising, and the Sceane was changed into a delicious prospect; wherein were rowes of Trees, Fountains, Statues, Arbors, Grota's, walkes, and all such things of delight, as might expresse the beautifull garden of the Britanides. The morning Starre appeares in the Aire, sitting on a bright Cloud, in forme of a beautifull youth naked, with a mantle of watchet Cipresse, on his head a Star. On the other side of the Heaven came forth Aurora in a Chariot touch'd with gold, borne up by a rosie coloured cloud, her garment white trim'd with gold, loosely tuck'd about her, and cut downe on the sides; her armes bare with bracelets of gold, with a vaile of Carnation flying, as blowne up by the winde, her wings white spotted with gold, her faire haire disheveled, and on her head a Girland of Roses. Hesperus askes Aurora, why the Sunne is so long in comming, and whether being weary of his last journey; he is gone to take his rest. Aurora answers, that her brother the Sunne hath for this time given up his charge of lightning this Hemisphere to a terrestriall Beautie, in whom intellectuall and corporeall brightnesse are joyn'd, and therefore bids him descend and summon the Arch-Flamines and Flamines to celebrate with divine hymnes: this Goddesse of brightnesse with those faire Nymphs dependants on her splendor. The fifth Song. Hesperus, Aurora. Hesperus The bright perpetuall Traveller Doth now too long the day defer, Can he grow old, Or, in his fierie chariot cold, Or weary cause he still one course doth runne? Aurora Bold Hesperus thou dost mistake the Sunne: Though's journeyes never can be past, But must for ever last, Though 'tis not limited how far, Because it still is circular, Yet sure he cannot tire, Nor mortally wax old, Nor's universall beames grow cold, Since fed with immateriall fire. Hesperus What is the cause he then so long doth stay? Aurora He hath resign'd the pow'r of making day Throughout this Hemispheare, To a terrestr'all beautie here. Hesperus Now I perceive why Poets call him wise He knowes the way how to preserve his eyes, This earthly Star (long since the boast of Fame) Is both become his envy and his shame. Aurora 'Tis true, should he appeare, he were undone, And eclipsed though in his pride of noone. Hesperus Yet in her lookes he'le least of danger finde, She darkens those with beauties of her minde. Aurora If thou wilt ever shine above, And in thy Spheare still safely move, Descend, and summon strait Apollo's Priests that wait I'th garden o'th Britanides. Hesperus Enough, Ile rowse them from their ease, That they with Hymnes may celebrate Her vertues ever bless'd estate. Both Her Nymphs (whose beauties can't expire,) 'Cause dayly kindled by her fire, Must needs be ravish'd with those layes, Since as their owne they love her praise. The Song ended, the morning Starre descends singing, and Aurora passeth through the Aire: As he descended the Chorus of Arch-Flamines and Flamines of the Britanides come forth, they were habited in rich habits of severall colours, as they are described by the Ancients. Hesperus leads them downe into the roome neere to the State. The sixth Song. To the King, by Hesperus and Chorus of Apolloes Flamines. [1.] Wisely did Arts great Lord That rul'd Mythologie, No vest for Truth afford, But to each eye Ordain'd her body naked still, to show Some kind of truths men bashfully should know; Thy praises being truths are silenc'd so. (2) Yet mightie spirits raise Their actions up to Fame, When lifted high with praise: Then who will blame Great vertue for ambition when it strives To feed on praise (the food by which it thrives?) Who earn'st, yet hat'st, himself of truth deprives. Saraband as they move back. (1) We know it is more lawfull farre Than possible to sing your praise, Who shewes how gentle, wise, and just you are, Must trace wide measures, not in common wayes. (2) As some in warre neere a defeat, Confesse betimes th'are overcome, To save their desp'rate honors by retreat; so wee retire, lest wonder strike us dumb. After this song they returne backe in a measure, and mount the degrees, and stand on each side of the Sceane. The seventh Song. When the Queene and Masquers appeare. 1 How dull and uneffectuall is that rage, Which swels our Poets when their numbers flow? Resembling sillily, in ev'ry ago, Things excellent, to what they least doe know. 2 How poorely have they done, when they compare A beauty that can rule severest eyes, Vnto some pretty twinckling senslesse Starre? Yet thinke they mend her by such similies. 3 If it be safe to gaze on beauty in extremes, Look there, correct your judgements by your sight! Those beauties neare her, are made up of beames, They gather'd from her uselesse scatter'd light. 4 Now judge (if fairest Starres no more containe Than what is certaine to th' Astrologer) Whether compar'd to Starres she so much gaine, As Starres have gotten when compar'd to her? Here the further part of the Garden opened, and the Masquers are seene, the Queenes Majestie being seated high, and the Ladies somewhat lower on two degrees, the figure of the seat was halfe an Ovall, about which were Termes, the upper parts like Cupids, and the under part enricht with leaves. At the two ends of this seat were figures of women like Syrens converted into Foliage and Scrowles, all which seemed to be enchased of Gold-smiths worke; behinde all was a bright skie, and in the midst about the Queenes Majesties seat was a Glory with Rayes, expressing her to be the Queene of Brightnesse. The habit of the Masquers was close bodies, open before the breasts, of Aurora colour, richly embroidered with silver, about the waste ran a short Basis, cut in starre-like beames of white, and under these were lower labels, large at the bottome, and cut in a Trefoile, tacked together with small twists of gold, the ornament at the shoulders comming down to the bowing of the arme, was of the same colour and forme as the Basis, their arming-sleeves and skirts of their gownes as that of the bodies; they wore well-proportioned ruffes, and on their haire stood a small bend or diadem of jewels and starres betweene, which in the hinder part had a scrowle, large at the bottome and narrow toward the top, to which their fals of white feathers were fastned. The song being ended, the Masquers came downe from their seat into the roome and made their entry, betwixt this and the second dance was this song. The eighth Song. After the first Dance. 1 Was there no other way Our wonder to allay But thus to falsifie reliefe? For seeing quickly tir'd, What moving we admir'd, You turne our wonder into griefe. 2 Renew your measures now Though but awhile, to show This respite was not wearinesse; But you by that did please To give our pleasures ease, Which if continu'd, had growne lesse. The Masquers dance their second dance, which ended, and her Majestie seated under the state by the King, in the further part of the Scene appeared a heaven full of Deities or second causes, with instruments and voices, which together with the Muses of Great Britaine and Chorus of Arch-Flamines and Flamines sing this last song. The ninth Song. To the King and Queene. 1 You that are chiefe in soules, as in your bloud, And nothing better'd by your high descent, Ev'n in your passions as in reason good, To whom vast power can adde no ornament. 2 Though Men the blest estate of Angels praise, 'Cause not perplex'd with what we sexes call; Yet you by such a humane diff'rence raise Your vertue more, because 'tis conjugall. 3 Be long expected in your Thrones above! And stay on earth untill our judgements know The noble use of that we so much love; Thus heaven still lends what we would ever owe. After this song, the upper part of the heaven opened, and a bright and transparent cloud came forth farre into the Scene, upon which were many Zephyri and gentle breasts with rich, but light garments tuck'd about their wasts, and falling downe about their knees, and on their heads girlands of flowers: These to the Violins began a sprightly dance, first with single passages, and then joyning hands in rounds severall wayes. Which Apparition for the newnesse of the Invention, greatnesse of the Machine, and difficulty of Engining, was much admir'd, being a thing not before attempted in the Aire. The Masquers dance the Revels with the Lords. FINIS.</field>
