      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. MEN. Vulcan, Crump, Mr. Quick. Jupiter, Stud, Mr. Mattocks. Apollo, Wiseman, Mr. Robson. Mars, Pike, Mr. Reinhold. Bacchus, Gauge, Mr. Battishill. Adonis, Joe, Mr. Leoni. Mercury, Drub, Mr. Mahon. WOMEN. Venus, Maudlin, Miss Brown. Grace, Miss Dayes. Huntsmen, Soldiers, Mob, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The lines distinguished by inverted commas, are omitted in the representation. A Saloon supported by Clouds, with a Table, Bottles, Glasses, Bowls, &amp;c. where Bacchus, Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, and Mercury, are sitting, singing Catches and Glees. CATCH. Join your right hands, to your glasses, boys, And let the bowl go round. Fill a bumperâhigher, Steady, steady, Let mirth abound. Charge your glassesâpoise, Recover! make ready! Present! fire! RECITATIVE. Jupiter. Bravo, my boys! bravo! bravissimo! Charming! delightful! exquisitissimo! Apollo, boy, tip us your manus; How went our fortes and pianos? Apollo. All right; but, I say, bully hector, Why don't you push about the nectar? Bacchus. That's right, my worthies, charge your glasses: Come, give us one of your absent lasses. [To Mars. Mars. Here's Venus, Jupiter. âZounds, that's Ã -propos, The strangest thing's fallen out: d'ye know Vulcan's gone madâ Mercury. âThat's no great wonder. Jupiter. 'Tis true, or may I never thunder: Horn mad! Mars. âThe fool! Mercury. âOh, dear, Oh, dear! Apollo. Tell us the story. Jupiter. âYou shall hear. [Takes a petition from his pocket. AIR. The humble prayer and petition Of Vulcan, who his sad condition, In hopes of satisfaction meeting, To the God Jupiter sends greeting. That your petitioner has a wife, The plague and torment of his life; That prudent, kind, and constant wishing her, Humbly sets forth your said petitioner, That might they but reside on earth, The many ills that hence have birth, Would then subside, and Mars, Adonis, And divers others of her cronies, At distance, all his cares might end, And she, his wife, take up and mend: To this request don't say him nay, And your petitioner shall ever pray. RECITATIVE. Mars. And have you your permission given? Jupiter. Yes, yes, they're bundled out of heaven; The Cyclopsâheâone of the graces, And she, in a stage-cloud, took places; Which diligence soon set them down Hard by an English country town. I took a twinkle through the ether, And saw them settled all together. ACCOMPANIED. Vulcan, no more; but, goodman Crumpâ Here, you behold his anvil thump; While Venus, where good souls carouse, Hight Maudlin, keeps a public house. RECITATIVE. Mars. Zounds! to what end? Jupiter. âGood bully Mars, To furnish subject for a farce. Suppose to earth we make descent, And plague them for their discontent; Some mortal shape let each assume, Mars. I'll be a serjeant with my drum. Bacchus. I, an exciseman. âAdonis. ââI, a swain, âWill pipe and whistle o'er the plain.â Jupiter. A country 'squire, the stag I'll follow, And echo rouze with whoop and hollow; Thus Vulcan all his pranks we'll tell of, And make the black know when he's well off; But first let's roar another chorus, And drain the nectar that's before us. GLEE. Those mortals say right, in their jovial abodes, That a glass of good punch is the drink of the gods. Take only a smack of The nectar we crack of You'll find it is punch and no more; The ingredients they mingle, Are contraries single, So are ours, they're the elements four. Then, Bacchus, for thou art the drunkard's protector, Issue instant a fiat, And let who dare deny it, That nectar's good punch, and that good punch is nectar. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Skirts of a Country Town; on one Side a Blacksmith's Shop; on the other, a Public House, the sign of the Horns. Crump and his Men are at Work. Huntsmen behind. CHORUS AND AIR. Blacks. Strike, strike, ton, ton, ton, ron. Hunts. Sound, sound, tan, ran, ran, tan. Blacks. Let the hammer resound, While we take the stroke round, Ton, ton, ton, ton, ton, ton, ton. Hunts. Let echo resound The cry of each hound, And the horn reply, ta ran, ran ton. Crump. Here, Maudlin, Grace, plague take you all, Till I am hoarse you make me bawl. Enter Grace. Grace. Lord, Sir, you rouse us all so soonâ Crump. You baggage would you lie 'till noon? Come, come, bestir youâlight the fire, 'Tis late in the morn, And the merry horn, Says we may soon expect the 'squire. [Crump goes to the Shop, and Grace to the House. Cho. Strike, strike, &amp;c. Re-enter Grace. Crump. Grace, is your mistress yet come down; Tell her I'm going up the town, But want to see her firstâ Grace. âI go, Sir. [A flute heard behind. Crump. Hey-day, what piping's that? Grace. â'Tis Joe, Sir; The shepherd Joe, who lives just here, He plays so charmingly, Oh, dear! Not better, Sir, pip'd Mercury, When, one of the sister-graces, I On Ida with the laughing lovesâ Crump. Peace, jade, and fetch my hat and gloves. Cho. Strike, strike, &amp;c. RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED. Crump. Here, take these shoes to farmer Swine, I've heard the folks laugh at that sign; And one cried boo: another chuckled, That's sure the house of some old cuckold. George, go mend farmer Hedgestake's plough; I dream'd last night, that on my brow, Large horns grew out; and then, to-day, Scarce to the door I'd found my way; But perch'd upon that tree, my bane, The cuckooâZounds! he's there again. AIR. [I.] Tell me, am I laugh'd to scorn? Have I on each brow a horn? This I suspect, and if 'tis true, Quickly answer meâCuckoo! I have my cue, Alas! 'tis true, Hark, she answers me Cuckoo. II. That answer's yes, the murder's out, At least I shall no longer doubt; But tell me, if to one or two, Or more I am oblig'dâCuckoo! What more than two? Alas! 'tis trueâ Hark, she answers meâCuckoo! III. In vain then do I beat my pate, A cuckold am I dubb'd by fate, Beholdâhere are my antlersâboo! Am I not right, my friendâCuckoo! Then plain to view, My fears are true; Hark, she answers meâCuckoo! RECITATIVE. To what humility I've buckled! And shall a god be made a cuckold? That Joe the shepherd, all her tone is, He looks smooth-fac'd so like Adoms! Then we've a serjeant brings his drums; A sportsman tooâbut here she comes. Enter Maudlin from the House. AIR. [I.] Venus now no more behold me, But an humble village-dame, Coarse and homely trappings fold me, And mistress Maudlin is my name. II. Yet here no less is paid that duty, Ever due to Venus' worth, Not more insensible of beauty, Than gods in heaven, are men on earth. RECITATIVE. Maudlin. Dear Mister Crump, you make me rise, Before I scarce have clos'd my eyes. Crump. Nay, nay, 'tis not so soon, good mate. Maudlin. The serjeant kept me up so lateâ Crump. The serjeant! ay! ay! Maudlin. âHey! how now? Why, what a grumbling elf art thou? You're never easy, ill nor well; In heaven you thought yourself in hell. Crump. 'Tis true, good wife, and now I curse The earth, for some place ten times worse. âAll worlds for me have plagues alike; âHere shepherd Joe, and Serjeant Pike, âSupply, to make me curse my stars, âThe place of Jove, Adonis, Marsâ Maudlin. âUngrateful villainâ'pon my credit, â'Tis a base lie, who ever said it.â I see how 'tis, it stops the breath o'me, 'Deed, Mr. Crump, you'll be the death o' me; Your false suspicions sink so deep inâ Crump. Dear me, I've set my wife a weeping. AIR. [I.] When I've been working in my shop, You many a time have seen me drop Some water on the doubtful fire, When I've been, &amp;c. &amp;c. Which damp'd at first, more dead has grown, But quickly, by the bellows blown, Has chang'd from brown to dusky red, Then brighter heat and lustre shed, And flam'd, and sparkl'd up the higher, Which damp'd at first, &amp;c, &amp;c. II. Thus trickling tears from you that part, Have often damp'd my doubtful heart, And quench'd a-while my passion's heat; Thus trickling tears, &amp;c, &amp;c. But soon arous'd by kindling eyes, I've felt a-new my passion rise, While sob and sigh, and sigh and sob, Have made my bosom throb and throb, And like sledge-hammers on it beat. But soon arous'd, &amp;c, &amp;c. âIII. âThe ir'n too, from the fire when ta'en, âI've thumpt, and thumpt, and thumpt again, âAnd shap'd by sure, though slow degrees; âThe iron too, &amp;c, &amp;c. âSo you, by persevering well, âHave found a means my strength to quell, âAnd all by dint of practis'd art, âHave thumpt, and thumpt, and thumpt my heart, âAnd moulded just which way you please, âSo you by persevering, &amp;c, &amp;c.â [Exit Vulcan. Maudlin. He's off, thank heav'n, a while at least; Oh, how I loath the filthy beast! Such husbands! would the devil had 'em! Here, Grace! I want you. Enter Grace from the House. Grace. âComing, Madam. Maudlin. Grace, lose no time, but instant sally To shepherd Joe, in yonder valley; Tell him, I'll come to him the moment I have eat my dinner. Grace. âWhat a foment! Lord, Madam, you're in such a magram! And all for that poor tatter'd wagram! If for the 'Squire you made a fuss, One should not wonder! Maudlin. âSaucy puss! I tell you, I am set upon it; Go, and put on your cloak and bonnet. AIR. Grace. I'd have you to know, Good Madam Venus, The difference is not so great between us: Men, if you need 'em, In this land of freedom, At will, a pretty girl secures; And as for all your airs and graces, If you come for to go To talk of faces, I fancy mine is as good as yours. You are not with your Jupiters, Ma'am, and your Mars's, With whom you used to play such farces; You are here in the region of liberty. So let us have none of your fine commences; Why, surely, good Madam, you've lost your senses: For if so much you think yourself better than me, I'd have you to know, &amp;c. [Exit. RECITATIVE. Maudlin. The saucy baggage! What a clatter! But privy-counsellors will chatter; And, faith, in this my situation, She is of service in that station: For scarce had I been twenty hours On earth, but lovers came in showers. âSportsmen would stop, at me to stare, âThough coursing in full speed a hare; âSerjeants recruiting in the street, âLay all their laurels at my feet. âThe young, the old, the grave, the gay, âTo me their adoration pay. âBut have they won me? Alas! no, âNone has my heart, but shepherd Joe; âForm'd to receive and give delight, âAdonis-like, he meets my fight; âAnd for his sake I'll make a jest, âJeer at, and laugh to scorn, the rest.â AIR. [I.] âThat nature's every where the same, âEach passing day discovers; âFor that, in me âSome charms they see, âBehold me, though a country dame, âLeading a crowd of lovers.â II. My sporting 'Squire to keep at bay The course I'll double over; While he intent On a wrong scent, Shall always find me stole away, When he cries, Hark, to cover! III. With new-coin'd oaths, my grenadier May think to storm and bluster, And swear, by Mars, My eyes are stars That light to love: he'll soon find here Such stuff will ne'er pass muster. IV. Thus will I serve those I distrust, First laugh at, then refuse 'em; But, Ah! not so The shepherd Joe; He like Adonis look'd, when first I press'd him to my bosom. [Maudlin goes into the House. Enter 'Squire Stud, Huntsmen with dogs and a dead hare. Stud. Hoics, hoics, my boys! House, house, here, hey! Zounds! why, they are all stolen away. Enter Maudlin from the house. Maudlin. Not all, 'Squire; I'm at home, at least. Stud. So broke the morning from the east. Maudlin. For shame! Stud. âWhat have you got to eat? Maudlin. Who's there? Bring hither the cold meat. Stud. Do, that's my hearty. And, d'ye hear? A tankard of my favourite beer. We'll drink it as we sit in th'air. Maudlin. The morning has been pure and fair. Stud. As fair and lovely as your face. Maudlin. Pha! Did it prove a pleasant chase? What stiles and ditches have you pass'd? Stud. I'll tell it you from first to last. AIR. [I.] The moment Aurora peep'd into the room, I put on my cloaths, and I call'd for my groom: Will Whistle by this had uncoupled the hounds, Who, lively and mettlesome, frisk'd o'er the grounds. And now we're all saddled, fleet Dapple and Grey, Seem'd longing to hear the glad sound, Hark, away! II. 'Twas now, by the clock, about five in the morn, And we all gallopp'd off to the sound of the horn; Jack Gater, Bill Babbler, and Dick at the Goose; When, all of a sudden, out starts Mistress Puss. Men, horses, and dogs, not a moment would stay, And Echo was heard to cry, Hark, hark away! III. The course was a fine one, she took o'er the plain, Which she doubled, and doubled, and doubled again; 'Till at last, she to cover return'd out of breath; Where I, and Will Whistle, were in at the death; Then, in triumph for you, I the hare did display, And cry'd to the horns, My boys, hark, hark away. [Exit to the house. Enter Grace. MAUDLIN. So, mistress confidence, you're there? [To Grace. GRACE. Yes, Ma'am, I come from you know where; How can you doat on such a clown! MAUDLIN. If you expect that old silk gown, You'll change your toneâyou understand me; GRACE. Ma'am, to be sure, if you command me; And now I think on him again, He is the handsomest of men, His eyes so tender are, and brightâ Is it the blue, Ma'am, shot with white? STUD. Here's that, my boys, speaks all men's lingo; Maudlin, your healthâ'Tis rare good stingo. Hey, what the devil's all this drumming! GRACE. As sure as eggs the Serjeant's coming? Enter Serjeant Pike and Soldiers. AIR. PIKE. [I.] Come all you gemmen volunteers, Of glory who would share, And leaving with your wives your fears, To the drum head repair; Or, to the noble Serjeant Pike, Come, come, without delay; You'll enter into present pay. Come, come, the bargain strike; A golden guinea, and a crown, Besides, the lord knows what, renown; His Majesty's the donor; And if you die, Why then you lie Stretch'd in the bed of honour. II. Does any 'prentice work too hard? Fine clothes would any wear? Would any one his wife discard? To the drum head repair. Or to the, &amp;c. III. Is your estate put out to nurse? Are you a cast off peer? Have you no money in your purse, To the drum-head repair. Or to the, &amp;c. RECITATIVE. PIKE. Bring out a flaggon of strong beerâ What, lovely Maudlin, are you there? May I ne'er conquer, if I bam ye, You're handsomer than Venus, damme! STUD. Have you pretensions to that lady, Sir? PIKE. For love or war, I'm always ready, Sir? And, should that lady say the word, To answer you, I'd draw my sword. STUD. Damme, you'd eat it up as soon: Come, come, friend, you are some poltroon! Enter Crump. AIR. Pike. Poltroon! Damnation! Zounds, unhand me; Either you villain, eat that word, Or down your throat I'll cram my sword. Squire. Put by your spit, you understand me; And if I do not make you roar, Louder than e'er did calf beforeâ Pike. Let me come at himâblood and thunder, Be sure you keep us both asunder. Squire. Let me come at him, I'll soon convince him, Pike. Damme, I'll cut him to piecesâmince him. Squire. Coward! Pike. âHack him. Squire. âBraggart! Pike. âHew him! Squire. Bully! Pike. âTear him! Squire. âScoundrel! Pike. âStew him! Squire. Swaggering puppy! Pike. âBang and beat him! Broil him! fry him! roast and eat him. Crump. I'll try to get them both well basted. [Aside. Pray let them go, this time is wasted; Instead of all this prittle prattle, Let's have a good old English battle. Squire. I'll trim your jacket, Serjeant Swagger. Crump. Come form a ringâ Squire. âWell, are you ready? Pike. I never fight before a lady; But if you'll meet with sword and dagger, Or o'er a barrel of gunpowder, I am your man. Squire. âHark, in your ear, You'd be, I believe, a little prouder, To have the barrel full of beer. Pike. Sir, I shall find a time, and soonâ Squire. Go, you're a cowardly poltroon. Pike. Poltroon! &amp;c. Crump. See of your conduct, wife, the fruit! Maud. Come, come, I'll finish the dispute. Squire, do you love me? Squire. âTell me, do, If hounds the timid hare pursue? Maud. Then with the Serjeant, o'er a cup, For my sake, make the quarrel up. Serjeant, d'ye love me? Pike. âHonour bright! Far better than I love to fight. Maud. Then with the Squire o'er a cup, For my sake make this matter up. You've said, you'll follow my commands, Without more fuss then both shake hands. CATCH. Then cease all bickering, Pour the liquor in, Put about the quart, To make the quarrel up, Drink a barrel up, And love the better for't. End of the First Act.</field>

While thus a rustic swain I rove, I envy not the realms above; What more can Jove himself bestow, Than what I now enjoy below? Freedom to chaunt my rural strains, And sing my love around the plains. AIR. [I.] A shepherd become, with my pipe and my crook, What pleasure to loiter beside the clear brook; While carelessly lying, Fond birds round me flying, The sun's glowing fervor allay'd by the breeze, Oh! who would forego such enjoyments as these! II. Ye roses and woodbinds, so sweetly that bloom, Preserve all your charms till my fairest shall come; With beauty inviting, With fragrance delighting, Your brighest perfections to greet her display, Oh! say 'tis for her you look lovely and gay. RECITATIVE. Enter Maudlin. JOE. May hills and dales a plain appear, If my dear Maudlin is not here; May sheep ne'er bleat, nor oxen lowâ MAUDLIN. âNay, nay, no raptures, dearest Joe; But come to me at nine at night, I've manag'd all things for our flight; When Crump gets drunk, as soon he will, I easily can seize the till: But if I ever am forsookâ JOE. Oh! may I loose my pipe and crook; May Cupid break his bow and quiver, Wither'd be grass, dry be each river; May all the sheep die with the rot, When Maudlin is by me forgot! MAUDLIN. I faithfully believe thee, sweeting; But I must goâthe club is meeting. JOE. Ah, Maudlin, Maudlin! that there club Is in my way a monstrous rub; For Pike, and Stud, and all those fellowsâ I own it makes me dev'lish jealous. AIR in DIALOGUE. Joe. When the serjeant, encourag'd by wine, To your lips once presum'd to advance, Oh! how did I sicken and pine, That you deign'd to bestow him a glance! And again, when the 'squire from the chace Returning, bestow'd you the spoil; From my mem'ry I cannot erase, That the prize you repaid with a smile. Maud. Ah, my Joey! one day in my place, (The truth on't you cannot gainsay) When I sent my suivante, pretty Grace, You kiss'd her all on the new hay; Nay, for selfish designs, dar'd to own, You pretended a passion for me; But attractions and charms I had none, For Grace was your favourite she. Joe. The charge to be true, I allow, 'Twas to try if you jealous could prove; For no other purpose, I vow, They alone can be jealous who love. Maud. And, for me, if I smil'd on the squire, 'Twas in hope of the profit in view; Or from Crump to conceal the fond fire, Which I bear in my bosom for you. Both. We have each other on the hip, Be jealous then no longer; But rather let a little slip Tie the knot the stronger. [Exeunt Dancing. SCENE II. A Drinking-Room in the Ale-House.

[I.] Young Hebe slept on verdant bed, An arm thrown here, an arm thrown there; Leaves were the pillow for her head, And thus how free one rests from care! Colin watching when she'd wake, His tired patience scarce could keep, But close did creep, but close did creep; Then touch'd her hand, and then drew back, Then close did creep, then close did creep, And criedâshe will for ever sleep. âII. âSuppose we on the sleeper throw âThe flowers here, the flowers there; âAlas! I have no more to strow, âAnd yet how free she rests from care! âSure should I give a tender kiss, âThus sound she could no longer keep; âLet's gently creep, let's gently creep, âOne, two, three; what, not wake at this; âNo need to creep, no need to creep, âAlas! she will for ever sleep. âIII. âBut Love who to the shepherd's aid, âCame fluttering here, came fluttering there; âCried, lance an arrow at the maid, âAnd see if then she'll rest from care. âHere, Colin, take my sharpest dart, âYour arm in this position keep; âNow near her creep, now near her creep. âWell done, you've shot her through the heart; âNo need to creep, no need to creep, âYou've wak'd her, Colin, from her sleep! âIV. âYoung Hebe startled with the fright, âAn arm threw here, an arm threw there; âAnd cried to Colin, quit my sight, âAnd let me rest again from care. âIn truth, cried he, I've seen the morn, âLess beautiful rise from the deep; âAh! let me creep, ah! let me creep, âWhile you, sweet Hebe, put off scorn; âNear let me creep, near let me creep, âAnd watch you while again you sleep.

Grace. âNo, no, dear 'squire; My Mistress, bid me, Sir, desire, You'd presently come to her. Stud. Hush! Gemmen, the bowl about let's push. Here's love and opportunity! Pike. Well, child, what says the lovely she? Grace. She'll see you, Sir, after the club. Pike. I'll come, and beat, love, rub-a-dub. Gauge. What going, 'squire? Stud. âI must be jogging. Gauge. Nay, pr'ythee, toss off t'other noggin. Stud. 'Tis little hoursâ Gauge. âBut 'tis fair weather, One crash, and we all go together. AIR. [I.] Gauge.

Why, Ma'am, he said, he'd shortly follow, And give his Maudlin the view-hollow. MAUDLIN. And pray, what news from Serjeant Bluff? GRACE. When I had spoke, cries heâEnough; The signal is thy lady's charms, And I'll be instant under arms! But now, good mistress of mine, If I may ask, What's your design?

Ha! my divinity, art thou there! âNever was Venus half so fair; âNay, look not on me, lest I die?â Thousands of loves my hearts ensnare; âTheir darts twang through my very marrow, âAnd every twinkle is an arrow:â In short, like Sweden's king at Bender, O'ercome by numbers, I surrender. MAUDLIN. Well, get you into number sevenâ But you'll be true. PIKE. âI will, by heaven! MAUDLIN. Do you then love to that degree? PIKE. I'd hang! I'd drown! I'd starve for thee! Count all the shot that fly in battle; Count all the strokes on drums that rattle; Count every flash; count every pop; Count all the groans, the wounds!âStay, stop; Count!âDamme, I've no more by heart! I say, Ma'am, metaphor apart, I love you more than life, believe me. MAUDLIN. And will you, Serjeant, ne'er deceive me? AIR. PIKE. [I.] Madam, you know, my trade is war; And what should I deny it for? Whene'er the trumpet sounds from far, I long to hack and hew; Yet, Madam, credit what I say, Were I this moment call'd away, Were all the troops drawn in array, I'd rather stay with you. II. Did drums and sprightly trumpets sound, And death and carnage stalk around; Did dying horses bite the ground, And we no hope in view; Was the whole army lost in smoke, Were they the last words that I spoke, I'd say, and damme if I joke, I'd rather stay with you. III. Did the foe charge us front and rear; Did ev'n the bravest face appear Impress'd with signs of mortal fear; Though never veteran knew So terrible and hot a fight; Though all my laurels it should blight, Though I should lose so fine a sight, I'd rather stay with you. [Exit. Enter Joe. RECITATIVE. MAUDLIN. Now stir not for your life!âSo, soâ What noise is that? 'Tis my sweet Joe. Make, dearest love, what haste you're able, And take two horses from the stable. This key, I fancy, will unlock it, And I've some money in my pocket. AIR. JOE. [I.] What are Plutus' gilded toys, What, compar'd to Love's rich joys! Toys that wordly mortals prize, Souls of finer sense despise; Free together let us rove, Heart for heart, and love for love. II. Free from tumult, frowns and strife, Free from all that burthens life, Blythely let us seek the plains Where eternal pleasure reigns; Free together let us rove, Heart for heart, and love for love. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Enter Crump. RECITATIVE. Here, Maudlin! Grace! what are you doing? I'm sure there is some mischief brewing; Upon the stairs I met the Squire, And Grace criedâMount, Sir, one pair higher. Then, as below I close kept sentry, The Serjeant glided through the entryâ Was ever usuage half so scurvy! They turn my house here topsy-turvy! âMortals thus hamper'd have resources, âThey've Doctor's-Commons and divorces: âBut we poor cuckolds of the sky âMarry to all eternity; âHowever, I'm a little in for't, âAnd damme if I care a pin for'tââ I will no longer bear this raillery: But see a light comes through the gallery. Enter Grace. Here Grace; i'th'dark this hour I've grop'd. Where is my wife? GRACE. âSir, she's elop'd. CRUMP. Elop'dâelop'd! and have I then Left gods to be thus used by men? Adieu, my forge, the anvil's clangor, The red-hot iron's fiery anger! Ye one-eyed Cyclops! Ãtna's roar! For Vulcan's occupation is no more. AIR. O! that a gem'man shou'd thus be ty'd Unto a vixenish wanton wife! I wou'd in heaven that she had died, And never seen this life. Flirting, flirting, flirting; Sporting, sporting, sporting; Courting, courting, courting; All, all by turns: With Stud, or with Pike, Coquetting alike; While this poor little head Dreams nightly in bed, Of something here that burns and burns, And feels like sprouting horns. GRACE. Lord, Sir, don't take it so to heart; Was I as you are, for my part, I'd let her go for one more kinder. CRUMP. That's true, indeed; but where to find her!â GRACE. And you don't know? A likely story! Sir, she I speak of stands before you. CRUMP. Will you then on me take compassion? GRACE. Yes to be sure, Sir, 'tis the fashion, When Madam such a trick has play'd, The husband always takes the maid. AIR. CRUMP. [I.] Let thundering Jove lead a boisterous life, Out-thunder'd each hour by the voice of his wife; Like a Harlequin, let him, disguis'd, play the fool, A swan, or a whirlwind, a crow, or a bull; Of such shifts in no need, of no wife's tongue afraid, Hereafter, I mean to take up with my maid. II. âLet Apollo, sonata's hum-strum on his harp, âTo please listening gods, who can't tell flat from sharp; âLet him follow his Daphne, and welcome for me; âAnd instead of a bedfellow clasp a cold tree. âMy Daphne, thank heav'n, I can easy persuade; âAnd I'm wisely resolv'd to take up with my maid. âIII. âLet Mars and let Bacchus, two birds of a feather, âOf wine talk and war, till they're both drunk together, âThe terror of all who live peaceable lives, âBeating watchmen, and picking up other men's wives, âI've no wife, so I cannot such projects be play'd, âWho would not like me then take up with his maid?â IV. Henceforth, then my wife may parade through the skies, Like nymphs in the Strand to pick up some new prize, Of Mars and Adonis and Jove at the call, For now, thank my stars, I have done with them all. Of your tricks and your fancies no longer afraid, Good-night, all ye gods!âI'll to bed with my maid. [As he is going towards a chamber with Grace, a clap of thunder is heard. RECITATIVE. Why, what the devil's this I wonder? [Thunders. Nearer and nearer comes the thunder, Some plot against me I'll lay odds! SCENE the last. Changes to Olympus, where all the Gods and Goddesses are discovered. CRUMP. My rib again, by all the gods! GODS AND GODDESSES. Ha, ha, ha, ha!â CRUMP. âI smell a rat, A pretty game they have been at! JUPITER. How, master Crump! What don't you know, Your old friends, Serjeant Pike, and Joe? Squire Stud, Ned Gauge, and Master Drub, And all the good folks of the club? VULCAN. I've nothing for't, but brazen't it out! [Aside. MARS. Come, come, old boy, you must not pout; 'Tis over now; but, pr'ythee, tell us, Was not you most confounded jealous? Did we not finely fret and stew you? VULCAN. Ha, ha, ha, by the lord I knew you! JUPITER. Well done, old Vulcan, not to flatter, You put a good face on the matter: Then what was meant well, well receive, To men, through you, advice we give; This little frolic was design'd, A wholesome lesson for mankind. FINALE. Cho. Then be content, ye mortal race, Nor wish to change, nor fate, nor place; You must of good and ill have share, And nature's nature every where. Jup. Once on a time, when men complain'd They were with ills too tightly stain'd; I publish'd in a certain town, That each might lay his burden down, And take up that, more to his mind, Some other mortals left behind. When soon (to see the ways of men) Each begg'd to have his own again. Cho. Then be content, &amp;c. Mars. I heard you once the tale relate, A son took up his dad's estate; But when the youngster had found out The packet held old age, the gout, The rheumatism and the stone, He quickly begg'd to have his own; And swore he'd never ask for wealth, So he might have again his health. Cho. Then be content, &amp;c. Venus. A lady too, who at a rout, (Dire chance!) had dropp'd her false teeth out, O'erwhelm'd with shame, soon chang'd her lot, With the poor inmate of a cot; But when she found, on a straw bed, She must repose, and eat brown bread, Wear a plain coif, and russet gown, She wanted false teeth, and the town. CHORUS. Then be content, ye mortal race, Nor wish to change, nor fate, nor place; You must of good and ill have share, And nature's nature every where. FINIS.</field>

You toast your wife, and you your lass, My boys, and welcome, here's the wine; For my part, he who fills my glass Shall be my toastânow give me thine. VII. Gauge. Spirit, my lads, and toast away, I have still one with yours to join; That we may have enough to pay, This is my toastânow give me thine.</field>
