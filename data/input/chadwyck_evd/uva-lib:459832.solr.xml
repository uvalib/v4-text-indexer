      <field name="fulltext">THE USURPER, A Tragedy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE TO THE USURPER. As new made Pilots when they first Take Sea, Fear makes 'em think each Wave a Storm they see. And when Arriv'd, at the Appointed Land; Mistrust the Shoar, is some devouring Sand: So here our Poet; having brought his Play Unto the Stage, the Muses fatal Bay. Fears even the Coast, he labour'd most to Steer; Doubting his Danger will he Landing here. But this same Itch of Wit, so fain would thrive; Just as some Merchants, still with Losses strive; That no successless Voyage made before, Writers forewarns from Coming to this Shoar. Who though here Beggar'd, still Design and Try How to deserve, or get a Charity. But in Good faith, 'tis held as hard a Task To pardon Wit, as Give to All that Ask. For here's the Difference, and the Danger too; Wants will Presume, but Wit's oft poor from you. In these Extreams, 'tis Difficult to say; Which is most safe, a Good, or Bad, new Play. Since 'tis his Danger, now who ere does writ, To want a Pitty, or to meet a Spite. Such strang Antipathies we well may fear, Both from your failings, and our Authors here; Yet I dare swear, He'l Count it his Good Hap, Though Envy strike, if All of you will Clap.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS PRIMUS Scena prima. Enter Demaratus, and the two other Senators. Dema. I cannot expound the Riddle. 1. Sen. It is a Trick, some new Device to insnare us. 2. Sen. I cannot tell: It wants a President. Resign his Power and Greatness, at a time, When every Stratagem has had Success, And all things Stoop to his Ambition. It puzles me, Dema. I wish he were in earnest. 1. Sen. If his Inclinations be for a private Life, He shall have my Vote; and let him make What hast he will to the other World. 2. Sen. If it were in my power, I would lend him A Lift to Heaven, and that's more Charity Than he deserves, when the Accompts, are cast between us. Enter Colonel, Strato, and a Soludier. Soul. What shall we do, Colonel? they say We are like to be Disbanded too. Str. Is there no Hemp? Go Hang your selves. 1. Sen. This is not the usual Dialect. Str. Your Servant Gentlemen. 2. Sen. Noble Colonel, you are melancholy. Dem. A Simptom of our Cure. [aside. Str. Your Wisdoms apprehend the Cause; If the Generals Humor holds, You three Will not take my single Security for a thousand Crowns. 1. Sen. You are merry now. Str. If you were no Senators I could tell you, You lye now: But bewo'ye Gentlemen, You are like to have a fine time on't. [Exit. Dem. I like this well. 1. Sen. Another discompos'd to. Enter Alexius. Dem. I am acquainted with him Colonel. Alex. My grave Senator: Hark! you promis'd Me a Kindness; We may be undone, if the General hold his purpose: We shall Be marching off shortly. Dem. Whither? Alex. To our old Trades agen. Dem. Why, do you believe his Excellency Has any serious thoughts to lay down his Commands. Alex. You will easily Consent: Are you not all desir'd To meet him at Timoleons Tombe? Dem. We are. Alex. Where he'l resign his Commission to the Senate. 1. Sen. 'Tis very strange. Alex. And which is worse in my Opinion, It will be true, And which is worse than this, There's little hope the Army will be continued. The Enemies (Pox on 'em) are all quiet, And we that fought for this peace, must Starve and Stink, For ought I know, suddainly. Dem. Nay, prithee be clear with us, and tell us Thy own thoughts of the General. Alex. By the Word of an Officer. Dem. Who'll take it? Alex. If you cannot take my Word, to what purpose Should I answer your question? Why I'le tell you, And you shall judge your selves, what will Become of him: These two days he hath Drunk nothing but Water, Eat nothing but Sallads, Talk'd nothing but Religion, and now and then falls. Into a long Fit of Prayer, that signifies nothing: If these be not Prognosticks of a falling General, Then would I had all my Arrears. Dam. Why? for your comforts, the Senate may hold fit to keep The Army up still, and though the General lay down.â 'Tis not impossible to find another will take up. Will it hurt you to Receive your Money? Alex. Nay, nay for my part, I shall be contented, so I be paid amongst a great many more, That shall be happy to be retain'd in your Thoughts, As men that dare empty their best Veins to serve you. 1. Sen. We have experience of your Valour Colonel. 2. Sen. And shall deserve it. Alex. Your most humble Servant. Exit Alexius. Dem. What think you now? 1. Sen. My Faith settles apace. Enter Cleomenes. Dem. 'Tis he: my Lord Cleomenes, my Heart Leaps to congratulate your safe return. (Gentlemen of the Senate of my Principles) Your Victories were here before your Person; Our Enemies in Affrick are all tam'd. Cleo. And Dionysius marching Home in Triumph. I shall take an Opportunity after I have seen the General, to give you a more particular accompt. Dem. One Word, Sir, We have Wonders here, that You expect not, strange Revolutions. Cleo. How? Dem. I dare not tell you aloud, and it will ask Your stronge Faith, the General. [Whispers aside. 1. Sen. He is a most Noble Gentleman, and has Preserv'd the Honor of his Family, And still maintain'd his Current clear, not mix'd With foul rebellious Streams. 2. Sen. 'Twas his Fortune to be abroad when Damocles began his Faction here; and, but since his Return, And the Kings loss engag'd with Dyonisius,â [Aside. Cleo. But that I know the Wisdom and Friendship Of good Demaratus, I should Suspect He would abuse my Faith; It frights my Reason: Resign his interest in the Army? But who are those approach us with grave Ceremony? Enter Hugo and others. Is not this Hugo de Petra? Dem. The same: One that may write himself Knave General. Hugo. My most Noble Lord: I know not whither I should First deliver my Message from the General, or Bid you Wellcom home from my self? But 'tis good manners to Obey his Excellence. Cleo. You preserve your ingenious Humor still. Hug. Sir, I was Commanded to wait your Entrance into The City; and in the Generals name, to. Congratulate your return. Cleo. He was ever gracious. Hug. But that's not all, By his Command I am to Salute You by the Title of Grand Master of the great Castle of Syracuse, which is a Signal Mark of His Confidence I will assure you: Leave off your Wonder, And Read there. [Delivers him a Commission. Cleo. It were no manners to distrust his Act, Or your Relations, who have always been A friend to truth. Hug. Let me Kiss thy honorable Hand upon my own Accompt; If I have a Soul? your Honor shall Command it to your Service. 1. Sen. If he have a Soul? he makes a doubt on't. Cleo. But 'tis too great an honor to Cleomenes: His goodness thus would prompt me to a worth; Who finding only some desires in me To serve his just Commands, would quicken them. To some becoming Action; but my Duty Is not performed, till I wait upon him. Hug. And we shall attend you; my good Lord, Demaratus, and Gentlemen. [Exit Hugo and Cleom. Dem. This, beyond all confirmes me. 1. Sen. A good Preface. Dem. Excuse me Gentlemen, if some great affair Call me hence: I'le not fail to meet you at Timoleons Tombe: where, if things succeed To expectation, I shall tell you something to startle you, And you shall thank me for't. [Exit Demaratus. 1. Sen. But 'tis not without my Wonder, That Cleomenes,â 2. Sen. There's the policy: 'Its frequent, When Princes fear a popular man, they labour To gain him to their party by preferments: Nor is it safe yet to Irritate the Souldier, To whom Cleomenes stands Pretious. 1. Sen. I know not what to think. 2. Sen. Think no more, let the gods play their Game out; They are wise, and Mankind is their mockery: But we loose time; I am for Timoleous Tombe. 1. Sen. The Scean of our whole Fate lies there. 2. Sen. I wait upon you. Exit. Enter Damocles, Cleomenes, Hugo, Colonel Strato, Alexius, and Proclus. Dam. The Place I have confirm'd, is but an earnest Of that great debt is owing to your Services: You have made my Son a Souldier Cleomenes; He cannot fail of Victory, that lives Near the example of so much Honor. Cleo. I have perform'd my Duty, All above it, Sir, is your Bounty. Dam. But is Timandra within his Train of Captives? Heir to the great Numidian, King Ophella, whose unquiet Armes kept us so much in Action. Cleo. But his fall procur'd you many Victories. Dam. A Princess of much Beauty by my Sons Description, so much excellency of Person And bravery, I guess there's something in't, Beside the naked Story: He does write as He were prompted by Affection. Cleo. His Deportments have been fair to her, And like himself. Dam. We shall see this Wonder. But what's the Moore he talks off? Cleo. A person of no mean Extraction, That came to shew his Valour in her Cause, Whom the impatient Courage of your Souldier Compel'd to wait upon Timandra's Fortune, And fills a place now in her Train. Dam. 'Tis well Cleomenes: The present state Of things requires you, take possession Of the Castle, where I shall soon give you a visit: I have trusted you with Siracuse, and my self. Cleo. To both I shall be faithful, Sir.â [Exit Cleo. Dam. What think'st thou of him Hugo? Hug. You have done wisely to Secure him thus; This will Cajole the Citizens. Dam. How now Gentlemen? I thought you would have waited on Cleomenes To his new Charge: Your looks are Sullen: Ha! This shews like an Affront to me; as you Meant to dispute the Justice of my Fav-vours. Col. Str. We know Cleomenes is a Noble Gentleman, And think your Excellence hath not been sparing In your Reward: We hope you do remember, We have fought for you too; In all your Fortunes Shew'd both our Love and Courage. Dam. Now I see, and pity your Envies; y'are not wise: Can you remember this, and think I can Forget my Veteranes, to whose constant Valour I owe my Growth, my Glories, and my Self? Yon cannot loose mein a Wilderness: Though you should make no pursuit after me, It would become my Care to finde you out, To honour and reward you; and in confidence That you are still the same Men that dare Execute When I command; This day I have determin'd The Harvest of your Fortunes. Col. Alex. We dare Execute whatever you Command. Dam. Hugo, the List; acquaint 'em with my purpose; Thou art fit to be a Minister of State. I will peruse their Faces. Hug. Can you read Colonels? Col. Alex. Dost make a question? Hug. I cannot tell, 'tis not in your Commissions. You must be acquainted with these Names: They'r Men That must (Where sits the winde?) be knock'd o'th' Head, And your work's done; all but examining, What Baggs, Plate, Jewels, and such Trifles, they Have at Home. I cut out this work for you. Proc. Excellent witty Hugo, thy designs oblige us all. Hug. When you have done, I look for my Reward. Sir, the Officers are very Reasonable, and will do any thing You shall commandâFor their own good. [to Damocles. Dam. Their Smiles assure my Happiness, and their own; Which shall grow uplike Twinns. Hug. If any will go off civilly and Compoundâ Col. Str. What shall's do with 'em? Dam. Give 'em Wings, to fly to any Region Of the Air, or Earth, so we be rid of 'em. This day I lay all down, and like the Sun Set in my Evening Cloud: But yet may Rise. Hug. Or my Astrology fails.â Poroc. More bright and glorious.â Dam. That to the gods and you.â [Exit Damoc. Hug. You must not be drunk till the work be done. But hark you Gentlemen: You are to Act great things, Where's your Commission to Secure you? Str. That's true. Hug. When you have done this dangerous Service; Where's Your Order to defend you from the Gallows! Str. My thoughts were so taken up with the Hope Of Plunder, I minded no Security. Hug. I must provide for you all: 'Tis here then Under the General's hand: This is your Commission Peremptory, d'ee mark? This you must do, And more you may do: For many things Are left to your own discretions. Colonel. As how? Hug. If in that Company, or as you March, you see Any man, whose Look, Fashion, or Beard, you Like not; 'Tis enough to make him a Delinquent, And qualifie him for a Composition. Colonel. Most ingenious Hugo: We are all bound to thee. Hug. I shall see that by my Share in your Plunder. [Exeunt omnes. Enter Demaratus and Calanthe. Cal. You tell me wonders, Sir. Dem. Let me Repeat 'em Madam. This day will Damocles deliver up His guilty Greatness, and lay by his Sword, Hath been so fatal to your Family, I am transported with my Hopes, and Prophecy; The hour approaches Madam, when you may, Like a bright Star (too long Eclips'd) Advance Your glorious Head, and wear upon your Brow, Those Beams, that best become your Name and Birth; Daughter and Sister to a King. Cal. Alas! both those Relations cease; my Father's dead, And my dear Brother drown'd. Dem. Yet still you are Calanthe, Next of Blood, for whom the Stars Have finish'd their Consult to make you happy. Cal. By Damocle's Resign? call home your Reason My Lord, you gave me a preservation, When my misfortune knew not how to find, Or parallel in Story, a more sad Image, Than mine did Represent. Do not undo That goodness you have wrought by wishing me: Believe, there can be truth or hope in Damocles At this time, when Success Courts him abroad, And not a breath at home so bold, to murmur At his Ambition, now lay down his Power? He will sooner part with his right Arm. Dem. When I remember, Madam, who you are, And what your Royal Brother suffer'd; 'tis A fair excuse, if you admit not this To your belief. We all knew him a Villain: But what's all this, if heaven have now decreed He shall be a Convert? Cal. Till the Earth witness it, For whom 'tis partly meant, let us not throw Nature and Reason off, the greatest Argument You can assign, is, that he has advanc'd Cleomenes to so great a Place of Trust. A person of much Honour, and by fate Employ'd at Carthage, when the Flames broke out At home, in whose black Clouds my Brother Vanish'd. A man of the best Race of the Nobility, Whose Valour hath endear'd him to the Souldiers, And rather of the Generals Fear than Choice, Call'd to the Power, which he can soon take off. Dem. You are too full of Jealousie. Cal. My Lord, you must not to Timoleons Tombe; My soul presages, it will prove the Scean Of some black Tragedy. Dem. Hear me, Madam. Cal. I know 'tis your Affection joyn'd with Duty (That flatters you with Hope to see me prosper) Invites you from me: But i'le not consent To loose you so; my Father, Brother, all My cruel Stars have left me. Dem. I could chide your busie fears: To wave my Resolves now, were to be false to you and to my Country: The Gods and Justice call me; and you, Madam, To expect the Glories that your Blood doth challenge. Which I shall timely urge, when Damocles Lays down his Interest in the State and Army, And when your Name is mention'd.â Cal. Still I fear. Dem. Prepare for news Madam, to cure the tremblings Of your affrighted Heart. They stay for me; permit me to Kiss your Hand. Cal. Since there's no Remedy.â Dem. You are gracious to dispence. [Exit. Dem. Cal. Farewell my honest Lord; my soul divines We have had our last meeting in this world: 'Tis time to call a Counsel of my thoughts, I am lost else.â (Exit. Cal. Enter Officers solemnly, one after another, carrying a Sword, and other Armes of the General's Commission upon a rich Cushion, a Page before Damocles, attended by Hugo and others. Dam. Hugo, How dost like this Ceremony? Do not I look now like a walking Hearse? Hug. Most rarely; but 'twere fit you made a halt, You will arrive too soon, before the Knaves Be all met at the Tombe: A thin Convention Will spoil the sport, I always lov'd to see Full Audience in the Theatre; 'tis the credit And glory of an Action, and I must Applaud your Brain for this Design, who might Have done your business without half this trouble. Dam. There's the Delight, the mischief is my Luxury: To Raise 'em high, then Crush 'em in their Swelling. I do not wish my self Born to the Inheritance Of this great Island: Hang long Pedegrees, Titles of Blood, and empty Fables of Our Ancestors: A Ladder by which Fools And Changlings may ascend to greatest Empires, I will create a Claim to every Kingdom Within my Reach: It speaks the greater Power; And frights a Nation, which should be us'd To terror, lest their saucy pride and ease Make cheap the Person of their Soveraign. Hug. How every thing becomes you? We arrive Timely: Do you not hear a Noise and Outcry I'th' Temple; Sir, the Gates are spread: So, so, The Souldiers have been at it. The Scean Timoleons Tombe, where things appear in some confusion, the Souldiers knocking down Senators, and some are carried off wounded. Dam. Whether most Reverend Fathers? Hug. Sir, the press of People is so great expecting Your Excellency, that these venerable Gentlemen Did faint for want of Air; and are Now led forth to Breath.âtheir Last. [Aside. Dam. Alas! Convey 'em gently to a Refreshing. 2. Sen. Impudence! 'Tis thy Treachery: Expect A black Reward. 1. Sen. Dost thou not fear a Thunder-bolt? Officers. March, March on. Exeunt Senat. Hug. Those that remain are your own Creatures Sir, And most of 'em my Cuckolds, their Wives, Shall bear me witness. [Aside. Dam. They Represent a Counsel of the Gods. Hug. Had they all Provinces in Heaven, they would Resign 'em to you, and be damn'd to serve you. Dam. Grave, honour'd Gentlemen, True Patriots and Preservers of your Country, VVhose Bosome was late panting, and her Check Pale with the loss of Blood, the Punick Sword Had Ravish'd from her: I come not to shake you VVith Terrors of new War, nor to ask Pay For your bold Souldiers, by whose Valour you Enjoy your Shade: Sleep quietly, and Foes Abroad calm as the Dust that covers 'em: At home no Relick of the publick Enemy That fil'd your Streets with blood. Young Cleander Is out of Capacity to give You Alarum in this World, unless he can, After so long a sleep i'th' Waves, break from His gloomy habitation, and his Sister (In her self inconsiderable were she alive) Hath to my knowledg been long since a Tenant To her cold Grave in this Conjuncture of Affairs; your weary General Doth at your feet lay down his Sword, and all That power to Act you gave him. 1. Sen. How's this? 2. Sen. It must not be Sir. [The Senators rise. Hug. So, so; they are perfect I see, and he dissembles To my own Heart: The Devil cannot match him. [Aside. Dam. It remains only that I humbly beg (Grave Fathers) your consent, that I may now (There being no further use of me, already Tyr'd with the careful conduct of your Arms, Retreat into a private life, and spend My rest of days in Prayer, that you may live A flourishing State. 3. Sen. Will you desert us then; Dam. Good Heaven avert so foul a Thought: I shall Be near you still, and after refreshment, If danger dare approach, at your first call Take up my Sword again, and in your Cause Give up my Life, your Safety, or your Sacrifice. 1. Sen. However your great soul will not allow A sense of danger, Sir we are not safe, If you will not resume your Sword and Power, I speak the General Vote. 2. Sen. You doe not Sir (VVith pardon of your Gravity) Reach VVhat we most desire: In justice Sir To your great prudence of so eminent Valour To which we owe our Lives, our Liberties, And what else we enjoy. We humbly pray You would exchange the Title of our General, And take from us the offer of a Kingdom. The Crown cannot be plac'd upon a Head So much deserves it. Hug. Thou Boy! 3. Sen. As it were, Ingratitude in us to Court your Virtue VVith any less Oblation; So it will be The great Unhappiness within our Fate If you refuse it. Sir, in mine, you hear The Breach of all. Omn. All, All. Hug. Now must he Cant a little. [Aside. Dam. I doe not understand you Gentlemen, Pray speak agen. Hug. He cannot hear't too often. 3. Sen. Here we divest our selves of Power and Name Of useless Senators, and all Bow to you As humble Subjects. 2. Sen. All ready with our persons to attend, And declare it to the People. Dam. You amaze me Gentlemen; Collect your Wisdoms, I am consum'd already with less Cares, Too feeble to sustain a Crown (I think, VVith pardon you did Name the Word.) My sleeps Under that little Province I enjoy'd Before were thin; and those poor slumbers full Of Trouble and Destraction: 'Twill be justice, That under such a Weight I never sleep; So much will the Concernment of my Cares, For you oblige me to perpetual waking? I dare not Gentlemen give Entertainment To such ambicious Thoughts, Among your selves How many worthier men to sit at Helme, Not one in all this Circle but is qualified, To Guide a Nation: I have no Name, No Birth, no Images: Nothing in Annalls To speak the Glory of one Predecessor: Sen. This is your modesty, which cannot be Greater then the Necessity upon us To live under a Royal shade: You have An influence upon him: pray Sir speak: Hug. You hear what Necessity there is: You'l break their hearts if you deny'm. Dam. Gentlemen, Vouchsafe me. But some few Hours to Consider. Hug. Hours? They will be dead within this half hour If you refuse it. Pity the Venerable Gentlemen: Observe they Weep, and I doe melt to see'em. Dam. I cannot stand the storm of this Affection, Doe with me what you please: Although you make Me King, I hope I may take leave to Call My self your Servant in my Heart, and study By all the duties of a Princeâ 1. Sen. Wee are all satisfied. 2. Sen. Sir we all wait on you, And think our Happiness Incompleat, till VVe hear the Voyce of all the Citizens, Out noise the Trumpets at your Coronation VVith long live Damocles King of Scicily. Dam. The works done. [A shout within. Hug. Heark the noise is Catching. Dam, He that Aspires, must know no Conscience. I see 'tis easier to be great then good: Some Trees thrives best whose Roots are warm'd in Blood. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Hugo, Strato, Proclus. Hug. Come let me see your Bills of Mortality: How many Have dyed this week of the Bloody Sweat? [Reads. Three Senatours knock'd o'th'Head at Timoleons Tombe, and four in the Street for not holding Their peace; Six Senatours drown'd, thrown From a Precipice into the Sea. Two and twenty buried alive. How buried alive? Pro. Why, these were Totally plundred, or Compounded At so high a Rate for their Liberty; they must Starve presently; Which we call burying alive. Hug. That's right: Well Gentlemen, I have been Studying for you, and have found out more Employment, Unless your Conscience have enough, and in that want Of wit have an inclination to live Honest. Stra. You have better thoughts of us. Pro. What is't dear Sir? Hug. Observe me: I will procure you Commissions VVhen you please to talk witty Treason. Stra. Thank you; and so when the State please we may Be ingeniously hang'd for't. Hug. Y'are dull Officers, and doe not Reach the Knack; Yet I'le tell you: You shall insinuate into The Company of discontented Persons. Pro. So, Sir. Hug. You will have the Wit to choose men of a sound Kidney; that have Estates I mean, and can Endure to bleed in the Mettal Vein. Stra. What then: We understand this. Hug. Comply with their discourses, and Humour every Complaint upon this turn of State: Aggravate The Insolence of the Court, the want of Trade In the City, and the heavy oppression of the People. Can't Weep, Drink with'em, Winde up Their pity into Anger, and with the t'other Cup Pinch up their Anger into Curses of the present Government: After you see'em Ripen with some Impertinent Cautional Parenthesies, which you Must use (As I hope their's none but Friends) Whisper a Health to the Confusion of the Usurper. Stra. To his Confusion? Good, and what Follows? Hug. When this is done, or so much as Opportunity VVill give way too: Embracing some One affectionately, Dropping into a melancholly posture, Call the Drawer And pay all the Reckoning. Stra. We pay it all? Hug. By any means you must seem honourable: their's The Trapan, it will create their Confidence to other Meetings, to which they may invite more Of the forlorne Tribe, and perhaps beget a design, Or some Engagement for the Cause: To be short, VVhen you have wrought the business to a Height, Or Schrew'd'em into an Action; send for Souldiers At the next Guard: Charge'em confidently with High Treason, and bring'em before me. Pro. But they may Recriminate upon us. Hug. Where are your memories? You shall have a Commission To be Knaves, talk Treason cum privilegio, like good Subjects to find out the States Enemies: and if they Escape climing the Tree for't, their Estates shall Suffer. Out of which shall be defalk'd large sums for your Honest Services: And what harm's in all this Now? Stra. None in the world most ingenious Hugo. [Exeunt. Pro. Admirable Hugo. [They embrace him. Enter Calanthe disguis'd. Cal. Farewell Demaratus; and Farewell Calanthe, For I am lost too although I walk thus In this thin shadow that doth shroud my Being, Compell'd by Tyrany of my Fate like some Vessel distrest to shift all Sail, and stand VVhat Windes are pleas'd to Blow: Nothing is left now, But in this Cloud to attempt Cleomenes: VVhose Faith must either guide my Will to live, Or his neglect lead me a nearer way. Enter a Servant to Cleomenes. To death; Sir, do you serve my Lord Cleomenes Serv. Or I am paid to no purpose. Cal. I'le not examine that: pray give him knowledge, A Gentleman desires to speak with him. Serv. To avoid impertinent Errands, I'le consider VVhether your business may be worth his Trouble or no. Cal. That's out of your Commission (I suppose) to Judge. Serv. Young Gentleman, you are mistaken, in such Cases As yours, I have heard and determin'd my selfe: Hnm! The Governour is at this Time is engag'd to Serious Business. Cal. I know yours then: Hereâprethee acquaint him That I wait. [gives money. Serv. Cry you mercy, Sir: I find your Business Weighty. [Exit. Cal. I tremble at my self before I see him. What if this Lord should now prove false? Since Friendship but too often follows Fortune, Perhaps he is involv'd to Act which those That Rule; and neither Will, nor Dares beyond it. Where am I then? And which is worse then all Accounts of Danger, should he when I am known Give up my Honour, or my Life, to gratifie The Tyrants Lust! Enter Cleomenes. 'Tis He: His looks are troubled, but I see no Line within his Face to doubt his honour. Cleo. With me Sir? Cal. Sir, I have a business to you of great Concern. A Secret too not fit for every Ear. Cleo. Withdraw. [Exit Servant. Cal. I am a stranger to you, and perhaps You may want Faith to Credit my Relation At first; but when you have heard me outâ Cleo. Proceed. Cal. It is believ'd in Siracuse that a Sister To the late King (by name Calanthe) 's dead. Cleo. Calanthe! 'Tis so, or at least this Island Contains her not: But grant her dead. Cal. I must not. Cleo. How? Cal. Sir, She is living: to my knowledge, living: I know upon what Bosom I Repose This Trust: You have been held a noble Lord, And Friend to Innocence. Cleo. I Smell a Snare. [Aside. The Devil is at work already, But He shall find me Arm'd: To your knowledge living? Young man, if thou can'st make this clear, and that The Person thou hast nam'd by any Art Of thine may be invited hither, Ask Thy own reward: The King shall thank the for't, To whom thou canst not doe a service more Acceptable: and I shall think it Happiness By thy Consent to be an instrument To settle his unquiet Thoughts. Calanthe, After so strict an inquisition Brought to our Hands? No Reward can be enough. Cal. Reward, for What? Cleo. Betraying to our Justice the Person of Calanthe. Cal. Oh my Heart! My Fears are come about. Cleo. Where is she? Speak: I will command a Guard To wait upon her. Cal. Command all the Furies. I am mistaken, you are not Cleomenes, Upon whose Heart I durst have laid my Soul, VVhose Fame was never Staind with a dishonour: You are some Monster of the Time: Good Heavens, VVhy doe you allow him such an honest Face? Cleo. How's this? You will discover VVhere this fair Lady is? Cal. Not to Redeem thee From that dark place thy Soul is meant for, Hell; Though I am young I have Fortitude Above thy malice, and give my self A Sacrifice to Virtue with more ease Than thou canst name it: I already see My confidence hath betrayed me to a Man That hath sold all the Honour of his Family To buy the Favour of a bloody Tyrant. Cleo. Be not so loud. Cal. Be you less impious, good Heaven! Open thy Azure Curtain and permit My Brothers Soul to look down to see me now Bleeding and panting, at the Feet of once His Friend Cleomenes. Doe not think bad man One tear of these speaks any grief to die, But to have found thee false: Here, Take Calanthe, And carry her a Tryumph to the Rage Of your new Master. Cleo. There's tremblings in my blood: Calanthe! ha! Though sorrows have endeavoured to destroy Her Beauty; She retaines enough to make me Believe she lives: 'Tis the distressed Princess, Howere that Habit would Obscure her. Madam, (for I dare call you so) admit Cleomenes to your Charity and forgive me. We neither seem'd our selves: You for your safety, And I suspecting a design upon me From Damocles Agents. Cal. Are you honest then? Cleo. And shall be ever: Madam, my Eyes cannot Be weary of this Happiness to see you. Cal. And dare you Sir protect me? I am too blame To tempt you with a Care of my Distress That have been fatall to those Hands preserv'd me: Honest Damaratus, If I drop a Tear when [Weep. I doe mention him, you'l be so kind To excuse me, and to pardon my Rash Language. Cleo. Dare protect you Madam? For your sake I will dare the worst of Fortune, And Act what Honour can expect or dictate: I think it a high Favour from the Gods, And could even bless the miseries that brought you, But prudence will be necessary, till Things Ripen to your Freedom and just Merit. Cal. You may own me as Page. Cleo. It will be safe. Cal. I shall observe my distances. Cleo. Ha! Enter Hugo. Hug. The King is come to Visit you. Cleo. It is a grace to his unworthy Servant. Enter Damocles attended. Dam. Let one ascend the Platform of the Castle, and Give me notice when they approach the City. Cleomenes, I am come to bid a joy To your new Government. Cleo. You are ever bountifull. [He spies Calanthe. Dam. Hugo, What pretty Boy is that? Hug. I know not Sir, a very handsome Face, but if you have a mind to have a Boy, know a Face Will tempt you. Dam. Cleomenes, What Youth is that? Cleo. A Page of mine. Dam. A very prety Boy, he shall wait on me. Cal. Defend me Goodness. [Aside. Dam. Come hither prety Youth, What's thy Name. Col. I am called Polydore. Cleo. 'Tis well he ask'd not me. [Aside. Enter Alexius. Alex. Sir, The Prince Dyonisius and the Army are now Marching within clear view of the City. Dam. Alexius and the rest Rid forth to meet 'em, Salute my Son from me, and tell him it is my VVill So soon as he Reach the Out-works of the City, that He. And the Prisoners of greatest Quality attend me here I'th'Castle, the rest Rendevouz without the VValls Till further Order: I'th'mean time, I'le take Some prospect of their March. Exeunt Damoc. And Alexius Cal. VVhat can secure me now? Cleo. Madam, I'le send one to convey you hence. Cal. And what will you do then? Cleo. So you be safe, Let all the lives of Danger Meet here, and center in my Heart. [Cleom. officers to go off. Cal. My Lord come back, and hear me; I have thought a way. Cleo. Things must not be delay'd; Oh speak it. Cal. It may preserve us both, till some kind Star Smile on us: Come, you shall present me to him. Cleo. I will present this sooner to my Heart. [Points to his Sword. Did you propose Cleomenes your Defence From the fierce Tygar, and do I hear you Bid me now give you up his prey: Did you So late accuse me in your Jealousie Or my lost Faith, and after so few minutes Advise me to betray you? Cal. Alas, my Lord, There is necessity, I must be undone; And let me chuse my VVay. Cleo. Consider better. Cal. I have to keep the safe, who by denial Of this small gift maist draw his Rage against thee, And ruin both. Cleo. And i'le be rash as Passion to Oppose it. Cal. VVell that help me in such a straight: who must Upon his least Command be compel'd from you. Your Courage is not now my Friend: there is No time for more dispute: By all thy love, By thy own Duty, as thou lov'st my Life And Honour I command thee. Cleo. I am charm'd to Obedience, Madam. Cal. I have not Suffer'd to that Height of misery To throw off all Hopes in Providence: This Will confirm thee in the Tyrants thoughts, who may Suspect me else a VVoman, and perhaps The same thou would'st preserve: He is Return'd, be Confident. Enter Damocles and Hugo. Dam. Now my good LordâHa! still methinks that Boy. Is full of Beauty: VVilt thou change thy Master? Cleo. He cannot Sir, but be ambitious of it, And I am proud if you accept him from me. Dam. He shall be my Page: Thou hast too good a Face to be a Boy. Cal. You make me over happyâThis talk frights me. [Aside. If any blessed Spirits be design'd To guard poor Mortalls, let 'em Hover here Calanthe's Aid. Hugo. I'le search him if you please. Dam. No 'tis a Boy. Hugo. VVould I were sure of a Female with no worse Face for this nights Bed-fellow. Enter Dyonisius, Alexius, Strato, Dion, Scrophilus. Sir, The Prince. Dam. VVelcome to Siracuse my Son, and to Thy Fathers best embrace, who thinks no Blessing Can drop from Heaven so welcome, as to Hear Thou hast a Name in VVar. Dio. Sir, I must Owe To Heaven, and your great Precepts what hath made me Seem worth your Favour; and next them a Debt We must acknowledge to Cleomenes, Whose Counsel, and Example made us Fortunate. Dam. Again my thanks to you Sir: But where is The Queen Timandra? and the more you character'd So brave an Enemy? I desire to see'em, Attend'em hither. Enter Timandra and the Moor with Attendants. The Treasures of the East can't afford So rich a Present. Madam, you are welcome. She weeps, and yet looks fair as doth the Face of Day, [She weeps. VVhen it's wash'd with morning Dews. Madam, I hope my Son hath made no forfeit Of his Honour, Since you left your Country Under his Conduct. Tim. Your Son hath us'd me honourably, abating what The Laws of War oblige him too: You can't Bar the Resentment of my own condition, That thus contributes to your Tryumph; A Queen, your Prisoner. Dam. Nothing can have here: The face of a Confinement to your Person, Your are Queen Timandra still; and let me tell you So far from being a Prisoner, that you have made Your self a Conquest. Tim. How? Dam. A Victory of me, by those fair Eyes; So that what Spoil my Souldiers made within Your Kingdom, you have Reveng'd this very minute By making me the Conquerour, your Captive. Tim. I know not what this means. Dam. It shall appear (if you will give a little Truce to your Passion, Madam) that you were Sent hither by the Gods to make you happy And greater. Tim. Still beyond my Understanding, I cannot be more miserable: Death Hath not a sting beyond what now afflicts me. Dam. Be wise and tame those Fears: Nothing is meant Here, but your Honour and a Liberty Beyond what you enjoy'd: The Crown you wear, If you but smile shall have a double Lustre, And call to it another bright Companion; This Island to Obey you. Dionisi. Oh my Fate! He Courts her: Have I for this Stifl'd my thoughts of Love so long, in Hope [Aside. To gain him for my Advocate? and do I hear His passionate Addresses? [Aside. Tim. Now I conclude you mock me Sir, this shadow You have in your pocession, but my Soul Can never be your Captive Clea. Brave Timandra. [Aside. Dam. In this Angelique form I see you have The passion of a Women: You are Angry, When you have better thought upon't you may Call in this cold neglect, and think me worthy Your highest Favours:âSon, you may attend the Queen, Call back that Moor: your Name? [Exit Dionisius. and Timandra. Clea. Hiarbas. Dam. Your Condition? Clea. A Lybian born: my Extraction Honourable, I was bred up in King Ophella's Court, After whose death (before unripe for Action) It pleas'd the Queen to think me worthy of Her chief Command of Horse against your Army: How I behav'd me in that Trust your own Souldiers inform you; I am now your Prisoner, Ready for Death or Ransom. Dam. It may be in your own power to deserve [Whispers Your Freedom: Think on't: Withdraw. [Exit Moor. Enter Dionysius. Dionis. Sir, I have an humble Suit. Dam. I must deny thee nothing: But deferr it, I have something that is near me to Consider. Dionis. Near you Sir, I am your Son. Dam. Do you affect the Queen? Dionis. 'Tis in my Heart confest: and Sir, I hope, You will consent to make me further happy. Dam. Call in those thoughts, and be your self Remove.â [Exit Dion. I bid him be himself, and canot Curb My own effeminate Passion.âNow she's gone, I am at ease: Why, how now Damocles? Hast thou beheld the Horror of a Battle? Stood all the danger of the Sea and Fire? Heard grones that shook the Dead unmov'd and constant? And shall the magick of a Voice or Face, That perhaps owes its Beauty to a Pencil, Betray thee into paleness, and a fear Of every frown, and think it Happiness, If she but Counterfeit a Smile upon thee? Wake, wake, my Soul, and do thy noble Office Upon my Heart, that now is Shrunk and Creeping To be a Females Scorn. Who will Obey me, When I Un-king my self? Ha! I am arm'd Against her Charmes: It is too like a Virtue To be Love: Who waites? Where is the Queen? Enter Dionysius and Cleomenes leading the Queen by the Hand, with Cleander. The Devil has a Claw within me still. [Starts as their Approach. There is some Witchcraft in her Eyes and person That softens me agenâDionysius. Now I commend thy prudence that dost offer With thy own Hand what is so pretious to me. Dionis. If you please, this may have other Application: I can Challenge no Affection from the Queen, But for your Kingdom I wonot leave my Hopes, she may at last look kindly On my Intentions. Dam. What if I love her? You will not be my Rival? Dionis. With your pardon; If you be not Cruel to your Son, Deny me not what every Souldier looks on, The purchase of his Sword: She is my Prisoner; The Law of Armes gives her to me, Dam. Fools will be Clerks before they Read: I blush at thee; The Law of Armes gives no propriety Of persons: when we make 'em Prisoners, The Ransome they may Challenge: If thou hast An Avarice so low it shall be paid thee. Cherish no other Hopes, lest I be angry. Dionis. This my Reward? Tim. Sir, I intreat, your Son may not, for his Civilities to me, meet with your Anger. Dam. His best Regards to you became his Honour, I hope, you will not Frown on mine. I have This Madam only more to say; You shall But change your Pallace for my Court, Which will Receive new Honour by your presence, Whilst I change the name of King to be your Servant. Tim. This I expected not, and blush a little, [Aside. To find my self deceiv'd: I only pray, This noble Moor, whose Fate hath suffer'd much In mine, may have a part in your high Favour And Freedome. Dam. Sir, you have it: Now, Madam, I'le wait on you. Exeunt Dam. leading Tima. and Cleandra. Dionis. Cleomenes, hast thou Art to give a name to this Affront? Cleo. I am sorry Sir to witness it, his passion wonot last, pray let me follow you. Dionis. My Lord, I have found your Love; Loose not the King. O my enraged Soul beats to get forth: [Cleom. goes off. It is too full of Flame to come abroad yet, But I must not grow old with this Dishonour, His Act hath disoblig'd my Blood, which will Admit no Calm, until by Force or Art, I tear the fair Timandra from his Heart.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Cleander and Timandra. Clean. How shall I give my Grief a name that Live, And yet am worse than lost? misfortune never Declar'd me miserable, till this Hour. For while I Read bright Comforts in thy Eyes, See my self lov'd and promis'd to be once The happy Owner of thy self, and Virtue; I do Behold a Hand would Snatch thee from me. Tim. It must be the cold Hand of Death. I promis'd My Love to you with such devotion, As with our last Breath gives up our Souls To Heaven: And those that dare lay Violence Upon our mutual Vows shall Reap the fruit Of nothing but their Sins. Clean. Thou art excellently good: Perfection has No name in Nature large enough for thine, And what am I, to merit so much Goodness? Thou canst not chuse but see how much I am A darkning to thy Lustre: every Smile Bestow'd on me, is but a Sun-beam cast Upon a Rock, which cannot pay the Gift With any thing but Barrenness: The gods For some offence are Angry all with me, So much, that 'twere a Sin almost to ask A kindness from above for thee, least they Punish thy Virtue for my sake. Tim. Or yours rather for me. Clean. My Stars have made a Faction in Heaven, And poison'd all the Influence of thine, Which else would be less cruel, and take thee Into their kinder Conduct. Is't not then A Justice to Remove me from thy Love? Then all thy Grief would Vanish soon with me, Or else command me to Act something for Thy sake, which in the doing may destroy me. Tim. You do not think I can be so unkind To impose a danger upon you, whom I Have Beg'd of Heaven; and whose misfortunes I have Wept for as my Sins, and wish'd 'em wholly mine, So I might ease your Breast: You have forgot, I only Live in you, and when you dye, Timandra is destroy'd, I shall despise The Tyrants Policy and Rage.â Clean. Thou hast nam'd the Reason, Why 'tis fit I should not Live. Tim. To see my Constancy? Clean. And what must follow; A constant persecution of thy Innocence. Tim. 'Tis Conquest that way to be Overcome: I am sure you won me so. Clean. I know thy Blood will throw severe Disdains Upon this bold Usurper, who neglected, May by his Rage be prompted to more Wickedness, While I must be an idle Looker on. And See thy Goodness war against thy Safety, Like a tame Cipher, keep a place within Thy Breast, to encrease the number, when thou hast A mind to sum thy Griefs. This is not all; thou art to Combat with Another Serpent of a softer mould, Perhaps more dangerous, when deceiv'd his Son, When t'other canot by his fiercer Nature. This may Attempt to catch thee with an Art, Betray thee with a Charme of seeming Innocence, And with Civilities attempt to Cheat, If possible, thy Virtue. Tim. How I could chide you now: It is not well At this Time, when our Loves, our Lives, and Honours Are most concern'd, and ask our wisest Counsel And strength to guard 'em, to take off our Courage, By numbring up our dangers; as if Death, Which sums them all, were more Considerable Than our own Honour to be arm'd against it. Clean. Thou hast awak'd My Soul and Reason: I have said too much, Which not Consider'd, Springing from my Love And Fear of thee, were above all Forgiveness. Thy pardon will Restore me to my self: Here I throw off my melancholy dream. Tim. Heaven will have care of both. Clean. Thy words are Prophecies. Enter a Lady. Lady. Madam, the Prince Dionysius. [Exit. Clean. It may advance something, if you speak kindly To the young Highness, who may be Honorably Preserv'd, and be of use to our Necessities: The gods allow us prudence. Tim. I'le withdraw. [Exit. Enter Dionysius. Clea. Your Highness humble Servant; I rejoyce To see you cheerful Sir; the Queen was thinking, The late unkindness of your Father, might Have made too deep Imprission in your thoughts. Dionis. 'Twas an Affront shook my Obedience.âBut you see I wear a quiet Face. Clean. I see you can Retain, Your filial Piety. Dionis. I preserve My thoughts in their own purity to the Queen, And came to kiss her Hand. Enter Timandra. Clea. She's coming forth. I'le leave you. Dionis. Your near Relation may do me a Favour When I am absent, by some friendly mention.â I may deserve it. Clean. You have already Sir. [Exit Cleander. Dionis. Madam, it was not A want within me of that most Religious Esteem I owe to your person, that I did not shew more of passion in my late Affront, And you concern'd. Tim. You shew'd a noble temper And piety to your Father. Dionis. I hope Madam, You wonot think my soul so much a Coward To quit the least thought of my Honoring you, The Pride and Glory of your Sex: I hold it A greater Blessing to call you Mistris, than him Father. Tim. But with your Highness pardon; Here's nothing of ill Consequence consider'd, Or to your self or me: And dangers have But ill Invitements to Affection. Though you have made me Captive, I am not So weary of my self to wear new Chains. What is your Father's Court to me? A Prison, But with more Paint and Ornament: I take The Garden Air, sometimes the Fields, or Grove. But not without your Father, in whose absence I want not spies upon me: In each Cham ber And Gallery: And this he calls by Liberty, And glorious Freedom: But you cannot help it.â Dionisi. Madam, I came to tell you that I can And will, if you consent.â Tim. To what, Dion. To accept it as my Service and my Duty, I know you look upon me now with wonder, Forgive me, and forget I brought you hither To exercise the greatness of your Virtue, And when I kiss this sacred Hand, let it Bind like an Oath (that's sworn by all the Gods) I will not rest 'till you are free again Out of the reach and force of Siracuse In your own Kingdom; where your Subjects eyes, To see you agen Surpriz'd with your blest presence, Shall weep their sudden joys, and dye contented. Nay, in your own Court, Madam, where I found you, When you were praying unto stubborn Heaven That heard you not. If all this be not done By mee, and ere the Sun three times Rejoyce The world with Day, Conclude that I am dead. And one thing, Madam, more; I scorn to make A Price, or name my own Reward: when this Is perfect, you may please to think I lov'd you. Tim. You have nam'd such things Sir, (give me your pardon) I have not hope eneough to think'em possible; But such an Act would merit much.â Dion. I must Seem calme and easie to my Father 'till It come to Action: the method is already Form'd in my Brain: All that is good attend you. [Exit. Enter Cleander. Clean. I am glad to see these Smiles aboard. Tim. I have a story will concern our happiness This Dionisius may be noble. Clean. I mainly doubt it, Madam: If the Devil Should spawn a Saint it would be wonderful. Enter a Lady. Lady. Madam, a young Gentleman from the King, Humbly desires Access. Tim. We are interrupted; I guess upon what Embassy he comes: Please you, Withdraw. Enter Calanthe. Clean. He's young and handsome; What great pity it is He should be a Knave so soon? But the Usurper Is cunning to engage such Innocent Faces, To abuse our fond Belief: How the Urchin throws His eyes upon me? As he would stare me Out o'th'Presence. [Exit Cleander. Clean. Madam, I hope you will vouchsafe your pardon If to express a Service for your just. Concerns, I beg a Freedom. Tim. You attend the King? Cal. Madam, I do, but am not now his Messenger. Tim. I like it better. Cal. Though I bring with me what is fit for Princes To hear, the Language of an humble Heart, That in the general interest to Virtue Comes to unlade it self, and do you service. Tim. Thou givest thy business a spacious preface, And by thy looks it should be fair: But yet Sweet youth take heed the Court (thou com'st from) do not Instruct thee wrong: Thou serv'st a Master wise Enough to Teach.â Cal. My attendance on the King, Madam, doth carry No early date, and if you dare believe me My time hath been to mourn, not to admire Transactions of the Court: Some tears I have wept, (Though a stranger to your Person) for your sake. Tim. Prethee take off my wonder, and be clear: This Language would invite me to believe There were some Danger near. Cal. I would give it a Name That should not fright you: for it is Within your choise, timely to scatter all Those hovering Clouds that may involve you in Too late Repentance. Tim. Still thou art obscure. Cal. It is no secret in the Court; The King (For that he has made his Title now) does love you. Enter Damocles. Dam. Ha! what makes that Boy hereâIle observe. [He obscures. Cal. And cherishes a hope by marriage To fix his never satisfyed Ambition. Tim. This is not thy Concernment. Cal. But it will Be yours too soon, and justly may be mine Who have a Heart that inward bleeds to see So great a Queen, and more than great in Virtue Made a Tyrants hopes. Tim. Thy duty to the King obliges thee To wish him well although my Ruin Follow, Alas, I have no favours to Reward thee. Cal. To serve your Virtue is above Reward, Save what Heaven gives. Tim. This boldness wants example. Cal. I confess it, And in that answers his impiety; You cannot choose but know it. Fame has not Yet lost his Tongue abroad, and it might reach Your ear: Or if you have not been so happy, 'Tis not too late to tell you he is false To Heaven and all mankind: Within his Breast Dwells no ingredient of Love or Honour, And though he carry Bolsome in his Lip, 'Tis to betray you at last a Sacrifice To his unruly Greatness. Tim. I am a Queen. Cal. But in a Tyrants power, which knows no Law, When he has secured your Crown to his Ambition. Tim. I have heard too much of him, he dares not Act A Violence, although I be his Prisoner. Cal. He that durst act a Sacriledge upon His King, will think it but a petty Trespass, To bruise, or break a soft Heart, such as yours. Tim. All this I know is Truth: But why from him! [Aside. But that he speak so passionately the Vices Of this great man, I should believe I had A Rival, that obscur'd within that Habit: There's something more than my weak Eye can Reach, His words do speak a greater Soul, than what He seemes to enclose. Cal. I hope 'twill prosper: She seems to Resent it. [Aside. Madam, I dare not trespass more upon you: I have discharg'd my duty to your merit, To Justice and to Heaven; And now I cast My self on Providence for what must follow. If I have given a light to see the Danger, You might incurr with this bad King, I am happy. But if my want of years or Eloquence, To cloath my Honest meaning better, make it Less acceptable, You may soon Revenge it, I have put a poor unworthy Life within Your Breath, which you may throw into the Air, Or call the Usurpers Cruelty to punish it. You shall see Madam, then, I fear not Death; And in my last devotions will pray, Heaven may forgive you. Tim. Stay noble Youth, and Take my thanks: I know not when thou meanst To visit me agen. The King comes forth. Enter Strato and Proclus. Dam. Our Guard lay hold upon that Traytor; that Impudent Young Villain, Yesâ He shall visit you, when he can crawle from tother world. Cal. My Stars have done their worst: be you perfect Madam. Dam. Let his Tongue be cut out immediately. Tim. Sir, I beseech you, let not your Anger fall With so much Cruelty. Dam. Madam, though you have not merited so much If the Story be consider'd, to incline me To any mercy for him; Yet that part Of his punishment I Remit. Drag him to The Common prison till further Orderâ Stay, I have thought better on't. Carry him prisoner to the Castle, and tell Cleomenes, I have sent back his pretious Page, but bid him, As he will stand clear in our Thoughts, look to him, And place him in some Dungeon, dark and deep enough, Where he may Howl unpitied: He may afford him The musique of his Chains to make him merry. Cal. And when you have done all your Cruelty, Death will, at last (spight of your Rage). Release me. [Exit Calanthe and Officers. Enter Hugo: Stops, and goes off. Dam. Madam, you may be wise yet, to consider I honourably Court you: What is past, Is in your wisdom to Redeem by Smiles Upon your Servant; pray think timely Madam.â [Exit. Enter Cleander, and observes Timandra going of weeping. Clean. Weeping? Shall I kill him now, and Oblige The world by taking off this hated Monster? Yet he spoke kindly when he parted from her. [Exit Tim. Enter Damocles. But he Returns. Dam. Hiarbas: Nearer yet. You may Remember, I said 'twas in your power to deserve Your Liberty, and me your Friend: The way Is this: Use all your Interest or Art To make the Queen more soft to my desires. Clea. How Sir? Dam. I would have a marriage of our Crowns and Hearts. You understand? Clean. I must acknowledge You much honour me, But Sir, you have chosen a weak Orator In the affairs of Love: I wish I had An Interest in the Queen so great to serve you To your own merit; but in what my Power Or Language can effect, in Reference to Your wishes, shall appear. Dam. Thou art prudent: she has newly took the Gallery. [Exit Clea. Enter Hugo again. Hugo, I thought our favours would have made you Be near us still: I wanted thee. Hug. I was here within these Six minutes to attend you, Sir. Dam. I saw thee not. Hug. But I did you Sir, with the beautious Queen, And knew my duty better, than to interrupt you When you are private with a Lady. Dam. You can be a Courtier. Hug. I have news for you. Dam. What's that? Hug. Your Son presents his duty to you. Dam. My Son? Hug. Yes, your obedient Son, as I have Order'd him, He begs your pardon, for his bold intrusion Upon the Queen Timandra's Love, he has Done with her. Dam. Done with her? How? Hug. He has disengag'd her from his thought, and now Wisely foresees your Care and deep Contrivements Are for his good and Greatness, when it shall Please Heaven to call you hence, which I hope Will never be whilst I live Sir. Dam. I thought he had been stubborn, and resolv'd An expedition far enough to tame him. Hug. The People will not thank you, Sir, for that, They have no mind to part with him. Dam. The People! Hang the shabbed multitude. Hug. Oh! they love him Sir, and he is more endear'd To their kind thoughts since his Return. Dam. And I grow less, ha? Hug. The more's the pity Sir. Dam. But tell me Hugo.â Hug. The many headed Beast will talk Sir,â Dam. Of me? Hug. I Sir, of you. Dam. What dare they say? Hug. E'en bad enough: They were ill before, but The bloody Nose you gave the Senate, Sir, Has turn'd their Tongues wild. Dam. I must know what they say. Hug. I beseech you do not: Do not desire to hear it. A pox upon 'em, what can you expect from Rogues And Rebels? Dam. I have a prospect of their Hearts already; I know they love me not: But I do long To hear how the Slaves talk, and belch their poison: Come, Gi't me therefore in their own pure Vomit. Hug. I am very unwilling: I know 'twill make you angry. Dam. With thee? Do't I command thee, as thou lov'st me. But let me have no mincing of the Treason, Nor washing a fowl word; the Sports lost then, I'm in the Humor for't. Hug. You know I am the Creature of your Smiles, And must obey when you Command; Butâ Dam. There's no Retreat, Begin, now I am ready. Hug. Why, Sir, the people call you a Bold Knave: Yes By my troth, which in their opinion is a worse Name than Traytor, and more suitable to Their understandings. They that would be Thought less Soluble in their own Tongues, Say, you are but an Usurper, and though you Have the luck to dye in your Bed; nay, and may Have the liberty to stinke in your Grave, Yet they hope before they dye to make it a Holiday, and see you hang'd after all this, to The great Comfort of the Nation. What Rogues are these? Dam. The Rascals would be witty: On good Hugo. Hug. Another says, the Flames you have kindled Can never be quench'd, till some of your principal members Be committed to the Fire. The name Of your Quarters has been terrible; and therefore They wish, that every Post, that now carries A Libel, had also a Limb of you. Dam. Good, Good. Hug. For your Soul, they think the Devil will Scarce have any thing to do with it, though It be his due; lest your impudence should Out-face him in his own Dominions, and by Some Faction and Conspiracy there, Cheat Him of his Kingdom, as you have done your Soveraign here. Dam. Ha, Ha. Hug. They say, beside other gifts, you have two Virtues Most remarkable: Pity, and Devotion. Dam. 'Tis well they will allow me any thing. Hug. They say you can Out-weep the Crocodile, when You have the Humours to dissemble, and can eat Up any mans Heart with tears in your eyes For your devotion: the people never tremble more Than when you look upwards to Pray: Your days Of Humiliation are a certain preface to some Notable mischief: for if they scape a Tax, the Murder of some honest Men must follow: after Which you commonly Order a Thanks-giving. Dam. They observe me right Hugo: If they have any Malice left, a little more, 'tis excellent Mirth. Hug. They that speak favourably of you, say you are A brave Villain: In conduct fortunate and full Of Courage, but all misappli'd to serve your design Of enslaving a Kingdom, to Master a Crown, Which they say will shew upon your Head, but as A brighter mark of your Rebellion, till your Noddle ake with the weight of it, and both fall From your shoulders in a great storm; In which They prophesie the Devil means to come, ere it be Long and fetch your Soul away. Dam. A storm? I shall go off with loud musick then, Ha, ha: So, so, let'em talk on; and when their Breath Is spent, their Heirs may take up their quarrel And kill me in a Chronicle; where they shall read That all their Fathers were my slaves: Ha, ha, Farewell honest Hugo. [Exit severally. Enter Parmenio and an old Servant. Par. And didst thou wait that day upon my Father At Timoleons Tombe. Serv. 'Twas my last service Sir: Par. Didst see him murder'd too? Serv. I saw your Father, the good Lord Demaratus On the Pile with other Senators, Bleeding his Life away, and with the first, Thought it my duty, though it were sad news, To acquaint you Sir by letter. Par. And I find The story now confirm'd: I am lost to all the World: No man dares own me but this poor old Servant. To my Fathers death this Cruelty is added, That me they devour'd alive: All that my Father And his old Predecessors had been gathering So many years to keep alive our Family; They have torn and Ravish'd from me. Why do I breath this Aire? Enter Hugo at one door, at the other two Colonels, Calanthe, and a Souldier, leading her as a Prisoner. Hug. How now Colonels? Why in this posture? Sir. We are commanded to carry this young Traytor to the Castle. Hug. I ever thought he was a Rascal: You were Cleomenes Page Sirra, were you not? Well, I suspect Hugo whispers with the Colo. That Lord too: But what has he done Colonels? Serv. If I mistake not, those two Feather Caps Are of the military Tribe, that brought Commission to Plunder your Fathers House Sir, And one of 'em quoited me out of the dining Room. Hug. Ile bear you Company, I cannot serve the State too much, I love to have My hand in every Treason. Proc. You were ever active. Parm. Leave me I charge thee. [Exit Servant. Hug. What's he that comes confidently towards us? Parm. I have an humble suit to you Gentlemen. Hug. It may be so, but I use not to carry single mony, And these Colonels have nothing but Gold about 'em. Parm. I scorn your Charities, unless it be to kill me. Stra. How kill thee? upon what acquaintance? Parm. And to that I must have you consent, Ile shew You Reasons, and then I know you'l do't. Hug. Friend, your Reasons. Parm. I was late Son to an unfortunate Senator. Hug. Son of a Senator, That's somewhat: He deserves To be run through the shoulder for that: Look to The Prisoner; I do not like this despirate fellow. Parm. My Father was murther'd at Timoleons Tombe And by some marks given me, you may be two Of the Barbarous Villains. Proc. The young man's Angry. Hug. Look to the Prisoner I say. Parm. I could not reach the City at an hour to die with him, but time enough to hear, That since his death, that Fortune, which his Care Meant mine, is seiz'd upon: All my hopes lost, I have a Total Ruin. Hug. What dost thou tell us of Ruins, and killing of thy Father? Come to the point: Tell us something of Consequence; We have other business to attend. Parm. In short I must prevail with one of you to kill Me presently: Hug. Art thou in earnest? Look to the Prisoner, I say. Parm. By all my better hopes of to'ther World, I hate to live in this, Stript of all Comforts. Who draws? Ile stand a fair mark for his Sword. Hug. Sir, we have something else to do, then To kill a man that hath lost both his Friends And his Fortune: you must 'en live 'till you dye, If you had had the luck to have been with your Father, These Gentlemen would have done you Reason. But now the State is satisfyed, and for ought I see, you must live a little longer, unless you will Be impatient, and hang your self. Pro. We do not use to exceed our Commissions Sir. Parm. Why then my Sword shall try what I can force. Hugo. Look to the Prisoner. Ah! They fight: Calanthe runs away, The Souldiers follows her. Enter Cleomenes. Cleo. Ha! I have known that Face, 'Tis Demaratus's Son. Hug. Hold! I am a naked man: One of you kill him at my Peril, Ile save you harmless; Here's a mad fellow Indeed, O my Lord Cleomenes save me, defend me, there's An impudent Rogue, he calls himself The Son of a Senator, set upon us, [Two Colonels. My self and another Souldier Cleo. Not to have Rob'd you? Hug. No, no, the Rascal had a plot to have his own Throat cut; and because we would not do him the Courtesie, Like a Brazen-fac'd Fellow, he set upon four on's. Cleome. What's become o'th Colonels? Hug. Nay, nay, he has kill'd 'em for ought I know. Cleo. These are the men Of mighty noise and Husk, when there's no danger, Most nimble at a Throat, when they are numerous. [Hugo looks about him. But leaves tremble not more in a Rough Wind, Than they to Guard themselves, when they are call'd Upon the Accompt of Honour. Hug. He's here agen. Enter Parmenio with his Sword drawn, and puts it up. Parm. It is the Lord Cleomenes. Cleom. Come hither desperate Gentleman.â [Whispers. Hug. Ask him what he hath done with the two Field Officers? Thank Heaven Sirra, I had no Sword, As I do heartily: I think it sav'd my Life, I had Been paid else: I am in a sweat to think whether I should have gone if he had kill'd me. Cleo. So, no more, the Colonels made their retreat fairly; He did not know your Person and Employment And does ask pardon for the Fright he put you to. Parm. I humbly beg your pardon to my passion: The memory of my undoing was too fresh within me. Alas I was transported with rage, more for My Fortune then my Father, and I am.â Cleo. Of our own Principles, and for the Cause, which made His Father send him to Travail.â Hug. Saies your Lordship so? But Sir he has Rescu'd a Young Villain that was sent hither by the Kings command to be your Prisoner. Parm. I rescue a Prisoner? VVhom? or VVhen? Hug. That did you Sir, you were weary of your life before: Now the Law shall hang you to your own Hearts desire. Parm. Upon my life I know not what he means. Hug. The thing that was your Page my Lord: O he's Prov'd an impudent young Traytor. Cleo. Ha! VVhat has he done? Hug. Nay, I know not.â Enter the Souldier leading Calanthe. 'Tis he: by good Fortune he is recovered: honest Souldier Look for a reward: my Lord, it is The King command you, put this Rogue into a Dungeon. Cleo. 'Tis she, my Heart dares not look forth.â [Aside. Hug. He shall want no Charge I warrant him. I am Sorry he had no more Grace for his Relation once To your Lordship: the Crimes are high.âYou shall Hear more, my Lord I know you are honourable: He has an honest Face, but your Lordships wisdom Will be concern'd to use him like a Rascal, and so I take my leave. My most Honourable Lord. Enter a Guard of Souldiers. Cleo. It shall Speak my Innocence And Duty to the King: Take him away, I hate to look upon him. [The Guard take off Calan. My Soul's upon the Torture. Hug. Farewel, Son of the Senator, thou mayst live now To be an honest man, and see what will come on't. [Exit. Cleo. Parmenio, thou shalt not Repent to Live, I see thy Courage, and in thy Name And Blood have an Assurance of thy Faith. Parm. In all I am your servant. Cleo. Bid an Officer of the Guard bring the Boy back, And wait me at my Chamber to be examin'd, And be your near to Observe my further Order. Parm. I shall my Lord. Cleo. I have a narrow path To walk on: Guide me Honour and thou great Soul of the World: Things now for Action call: This Tempest looks as it would drown us all. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Sicanus, Dorion, Scrophilus. Scro. I do not like the present Face of things. Dor. Nor I. Scro. I did expect a finer Time on't. Sic. The Triumph quickly Vanish'd. Enter Alexius. Alex. Your Servant Colonels: Where's his Highness? Sic. In's Bed-chamber writing Letters. Alex. What to his Mistriss? the Queen Timandra? She's a Rare Beauty. Sic. Would Affrick had kept this admiration To it self: I fear she will be fatal, And undo us all. Dor. For my part, I think, no woman in the World is worth a mans melancholy. Scr. I am sure it hath thrown us into a melancholy Posture: The Prince does not enjoy himself. Alex. And the King is strangely alter'd. Sic. I have heard one man possess'd with many Devils, but I never heard of two men possess'd With one and the same evil Spirit before. Well, I fear a Storm's not far off: the Clowds Are gathering: This outward Reconcilement Between Father and Son, is but a dream of Fair weather. Dor. I wish his Highness well: Sic. So we do All. Enter Dionysius. He's here. Dion. Fellow Souldiers, welcome. Sic. Your Highness humble Servants, who should be all Happy to kiss your Hand, and see you chearful. Dion. Why, so I am: Am I not chearful Gentlemen? Look well upon me. Scr. Your pardon, Sir. Your Servants canot chuse but be concern'd, When any Cloud's upon you: Sir, we are Men that truly Honour you, and see through all The Sun-shine you put on, that something Has got too near your Heart and darkens you. Dion. I did not Sleep well.â Alex. We Believe it Sir, And something is the cause: Change but your Fancy, And it will Vanish like a dream. Dion. Your Remedies are pleasant. Alex. You'd say so, if you knew my Frolicks, And yet I must Confess, I have had my Fits As high as a Mistris, but never Ventur'd Love Above a Moon: Took notice of my Tides Of Love, yet made my Voyage off and on Without a Storm, or straining the least String About my Heart. You'l pardon Sir the freedom.â Dion. But you mistake the Cause. Alex. I wish I did Sir; But this disease, call'd Love, has a most certain Symtome, and wears his Night-cap so visible, That the distempers still appear, although The Cure may sometimes fail. Dion. Gentlemen, 'tis no woman hath discompos'd My thoughts. Scr. Why, is't a Man? Who in the name Of nature can be so weary of his Life, As to disturb our Freedom. Dor. If my counsel may be offer'd Sir, no matter what's the Cause: Drink Wine, and bear up above all the thoughts Of Friends or Enemies. Would we were I'th' Camp agen; this Drowsiness and Ease Will Tarnish all our Souls. Dion. You love me Gentlemen, and I hope I have deserv'd it. Dor. Is there one here that stands suspected? A man that will not Sacrifice his Life, And in your Service fight in any Cause, 'Gainst any Person? Dion. None: I believe. You would contribute all your Courages T'assist my Honour, if it shall Require A worthy Vindication. Therefore, Gentlemen, In the Evening I shall communicate a Secret, In which I shall desire your Faith and Counsels, Till when I ask your pardon noble Colonels. Scr. We'l wait you Sir. Alex. And shall be proud to serve you. [Exeunt Colonels. Enter Hugo. Hug. What make all these Officers here? I like it not. Dion. Hugo, to my wishes; thou hast kept thy promise. Hug. Pardon the boldness of this interruption; My duty may want method, but not zeal, To serve your Highness. Dion. Thou hast given me proof. Hug. I came to give you account Sir of your Father. Dion. How is it with the King, dear Hugo? Hug. Much the better, since I sweetn'd him with your Resolve to quite Your Hopes in fair Timandra: I found him Raving at first, and a Commission drawing up For your present expedition to Corinth. But I soon qualified that cold Unkindness And he expects your Visit. Dion. Thou hast Oblig'd me Hugo; and to justifie The truth of thy Relation, and Confirm him That all is my Obedience and clear Duty, Here is a Letter to the Queen from me, With full Resign of my Pretensions to her: And that there may be nothing wanting Hugo, To uncreate his Jealousie of either, Thou shalt deliver it thy self, and give him Thy own accompt of all things. Hug. I applaud Your Care to satisfie him, 'tis excellent; and I Shall take it as a great Honour, to carry this express to her. Dion. Honest man: What can Reward thy Faith, And care of me? Hug. My duty pays it self. Dion. Farewell dear Hugo, I expect no Answer.â Hug. I think you need not: This will do your work Sir. Dion. I canot chuse but Smile: that I shall make [Aside. This cunning Knave my Engine. I'le not trust him Too much: Parasites are a Race of dangerous men, Especially to Princes, who abuse Their Beams, as Serpents do the Sun-shine; Thrive, And yet Infect the very Light they live by. [Aside. [Exit Dion. Hug. So, I have an Office; his Highness Letter-carrier. But I consider the Circumstance carried a Gloss Of Cunning. That nothing may be wanting Hugo, Thou shalt deliver it thy self. Hum! And why my self? I am not Concern'd I take it: I'le be sure on't. With your Highness leave, I must make bold To peep into the Belly of your Paper kite.â If any body should see me, He would think me Little better that a Knave now: But 'tis not The first Time I have been bold with a Trust. [He opens the Letter, a Scroll drops. What's here! a loose parcel of paper inscrib'd Palermo! What should this signifie? [Reads the Letter. Madam, I have not not time to enlarge: Prepare Your self and your Friends this night for your Escape: I have sent you the Word enclos'd By which you may pass the Guards, from whence I will wait you to my Quarters; where With a considerable Train I will be your Conduct: and in all other Commands Shew the Obedience of, Your most faithful Servant Dionysius. I this the Letter of Defiance? Are you good at This young Prince? If I had not made a Knave of my self before Hand, what a Fool would he have made me now, and His own Father. The Word for their Escape! Conscience be quiet; I am Resolv'd to carry this Letter to her, but his Highness shall excuse me, if I keep To the Father's side; He's my elder Acquaintance. We were bred up Children in Villany; and when we Came to Age, the Devil swore us into a Brother-hood; Saving that mischief advanc'd him to be a King, and let me rise no higher than a Parasite. A little Art will make this Letter sound agen. As for the enclosed, a word to the Wise; I can But laugh to think what a Rogue I am. [Exit. Enter Cleomenes and Calanthe. Cal. My Lord, I have told you all the Story, and Canot acquit my self of some Impudence, Although I felt a Tempest in my Soul, To see this black Usurper hold so fair A Hope in the Queens Love, which by one Act, Might make him Master of her Crown and Beauty. Clen. It did concern your Interest to break The Rise of such a Fortune, and there is No despair Madam, but it may work A noble Sence within her Breast. Cal. She heard me. And in my apprehension (though Silent) Yet seem'd to pity both her self and me, But kept her passious even, and in order; At last she gave me thanks, and turn'd aside, As being, perhaps, not willing I should see A Tear was breaking from her Eye: And at This instant Damocles Surpriz'd us. Cleo. 'Tis high time, Madam, to consult your Safety, Which hath a sad Complexion; the perils That I have been acquainted with near shook My Frame so much; I labour with the Weight of your Concerns. Cal. My Life's indeed a Burthen, And 'twere a mercy, if the Heavens took back Their unregarded gift, since I have liv'd To be destructive to my self, and all That undertook my Safety. Cleo. There's something offer'd to my Thoughts: Ha! 'tis gone agen. Cal. Cast not thy self into a Storm for me. Cleo. 'Tis come agen. Madam, I have a Servant, Honest and Valiant; you may trust your Person To his Attendance, who may this Evening Convey you to place Secure; for here You are expos'd to death inevitable. There, nor his Anger, nor his Eyes shall Reach you: Leave me to answer your Escape. Cal. That were Without enquiring, whether you design, To make my safety my Ingratitude: Do's not my Reason tell me, he will make Your Life the forfeit of my absence. Cleo. Could I Deserve so well of Heaven as to be made A Sacrifice for you; How would my Blood Conspire and Crowd into a Flood, to shew A Chearful Ebb: 'Twere but duty Madam. Cal. My Lord, I allow a duty, but like not the The way; Since I'le accept defence, but on Such Terms as Honour would embrace a Victory. The Dangers are my own, and I'le be near 'em. Cleo. Then be it so; and be as safe as I, This Fort, my Life, and all my strength can make you: If I and they fail, You shall see and witness. O'th' sudden, I could prophecy, but dare not With prophane Lips, but yours are sacred, Madam, And you may say, there is a hand, that guides Your Safety: that great Fate that brought you hither. And it doth raise my thoughts that you must prosper: I find the People willing to shake off The Usurpers Chains, and then your bright appearance Will compleat their Joys, and make A Mourning Throne Rejoyce, to see it self Restor'd in you, to all just Glory. Enter Parmenio. [Cleom. Spies him. He has observ'd my Order. Be pleas'd, I may commend to your attendance This Gentleman: A person, on whose faith You may build a Confidence: It is the Son Of good Demaratus; Parmenio. Cal. I have heard his Father mention him; He was Sent to Palermo for his Studies. Cleo. 'Tis the same, by his good Fate sent hither now To do you Service; I must take my Leave, Affairs throng in my Brain. [Exit. Cal. You need not wonder That these few tears break thus unruly forth, They are a just debt to your Fathers memory, Who lov'd me well. Parm. Mine have been paid already, And it remains to shew my self his Son: I know not who you are, more than a Gentleman, Whom the Usurper persecutes, and a person My Lord Cleomenes would preserve: And I Presume you have Virtue to deserve all this, And shall think Death an Honour, when I meet it, With his Commands upon me. Cal. I attend Sir. [Exeunt. Enter Cleander leading Timandra. Clea. Madam, This Story of the Boy amazes me: Why, he so unconcernc'd should take the Boldness To venture so much Counsel to his Ruin? Tim. It is no less my wonder: But I never Observ'd a greater sense of Honour, nor Read so much Virtue in so small a Volume. Clea. I had other Thoughts When I consider'd his Relations To the Usurper, and had no Charity To think him more than one of his black Agents, And the worse too for his good face, It put me In the mind of the fallen Angels. Tim. I grieve for his sad Fate, but can't help him: Indeed I never felt within my heart So great Commpassion to a stranger, and It is but justice, since his care of me Made him so miserable. Cle. Dear Madam, Quit this sad Argument, and give me leave To tell you another story that concerns you. I have a message to you. Tim. To me! from whom? He must be a bold man, made you his messenger. Clea. From Damocles. Tim. Forgit it I beseech you; He's full of Love no doubt. Clea. Full of the Devil; And would engage me his, dark instrument, To bring you to his wishes. O the Favours And Treasures shall be mine: Have not I An excellent Office! Tim. What answer did you make? I fear his words Awak'd your angry blood, in which you made A Return, did not please him. Clea. Yes, yes, Madam, He hopes Ile do't. Tim. What witchcraft could encourage him? Clea. Being thus put to't, As the Oracles are wont to Answer, when They are consulted what shall come to pass, I wanted not ambiguous words that pleas'd him, As wishing I had so much interest, And strength to do him service to his merit, That would do all our work, and his too; Madam, He should be hang'd but once, and high enough: But let me humbly beg your pardon, Madam, That I have mentioned him, his very Name Carries a secret poison in the Breath, That must create a Melancholly, and Dull Those Christal images within your Soul; Let us Look back upon our hopes in Dionysius; VVhose promise kept, will pour a welcome Balm Into our wounded Loves, and Banish all Our sullen Contemplations. Tim. I Fear Those great things are beyond his power to Accomplish. Clea. O punish not your self with one such Thought, I confess, Madam, it is a mountainous promise, But hee's a Prince now, belov'd i'th' Army, And at home popular: The Rising Sun: Ador'd, and flatter'd: And who knows what Miracles His Love, and Power may Act. Enter a Lady. Lady. Madam, a Gentleman desires access, He hath some business of Concern (he says) From the Prince Dionysius. Tim. He must be admitted. Clea. Ile withdraw. [He obscures. Enter Hugo. Hug. Madam, I approach your Royal hand VVith as much Reverence as to an Altar. Tim. Have you affairs with me Sir? Hug. VVith you most Royal Madam, I think I have; But pardon me if I be slow to tell you what Commands I have from the sweet Prince; Ah My eyes are not yet satisfyed: There are so Many beauties in that Face, I could stand A whole day to gaze upon't. Tim. Pray come to the business. Hug. Come to the business? Ha, most gracious Madam, The Prince.â Tim. Be not so tedious: VVhat from him? [He gives a Letter. Hug. VVhat from him? That from him: And in that I have said all, and done my Duty, and now most gracious Madam, can Tell him what you say. Tim. I have said nothing: It does require no Answer. Hug. In that Smile I carry a thousand. Cleander observes, Hugo going off, and comes towards Timandra, but Hugo looking back obsucres himself. Hum! Is't e'en so black Gentleman, you are very familiar, I shall do your errand, How she Titters at the Letter, and he laughs And looks through the Paper: If I say I shall betray my self. [Exit. Clea. The thing has kept his word, and we must take This Opportunity; I like his Project. But, Mandam, though we make use of the Word, It will concern our wisdoms not to Trust His Conduct after: That were but to shift, A person, not the Danger, since his power Abroad may equal what is threatn'd here: Tim. Wisely thought on. Clea. We must Remember this Mock Prince is still The Son of Damocles; but our time is narrow, Leave me to th'care of Outward things: If we Without a Check but reach the Sea, we have A Friend from every Prospect; not a Wind Can blow from Heaven, and hence, but for our safety. The world's before us: Who can fear to drown, VVhen every Coast, and every Wind's our own. [Exeunt. Enter Damocles, and Attendants. 1. The King's troubled. 2. And he will be so, VVhile this unmanly Ague shakes his Temper. [He waves his Hand for them to leave him. Dam. Have I by my great Arts from a despis'd Prodigious Lowness of my Birth and Fortune Advanc'd my self to Honour, and to Empire? And now fix'd like a Piramy'd, upon Whose Top my Name stands the admired Object, And envied mark of Princes round about me, VVho fear what Crown of their's I'le next attach, As I have done this Kingdom, where I have VVith bloody cost rais'd to my self a power Upon my Princes, and the Nations fall; Both which I Ruin'd, with a factious Flame, And made this Clime too hot for temperate Laws: The Dull Defenders of a drowzey State, That slept too long, while my Ambition wak'd, And undiscovered brought this fatall Change; And as those subtile Favours that design The Bodies Ruin, by the Vitals first, So I began against the Life of Power, My Iawful Soveraign, whom I fought and forc'd In Battle to Retreat and save himself, 'Till in his flight he met an Angry stream That swallow'd him, and his great Horsmanship. [Waiters puting on one another at the Door. 1. I dare not speak to him, He carries Ponyards both in his Eyes and Pocket. 2. We must stay till he call Dam. The Senate then a lazy lump of Power, With forcked Heads threatn'd to sit heavy Upon my Heart: But I found ways by purge And bleeding to Remove 'em, and constrain'd The dull Remains to humble their proud necks For we to walk on: All things that Oppos'd, Until this period, I made tame and stoop, And shall at last a Woman baffle me: Defie my Love, my Anger and my Conquest? I will disolve that Magick that she trusts to, And make her know 'tis in my power to take (If she be obstinate) more than I have ask'd: And that bold talking treacherous Boy shall live To see her pride and stubbornness tormented. And should my Son Rebel agen, and offer at An interest with me: I have an engin [Handles his Dagger. That wakes at my first call, shall strick him to Eternal Silence. Enter again one of the Waiters. 1. Sir, I beseech your pardon. Dam. VVhat Tumults this? 2. Hugo, Sir, says, he must speak with you. Dam. O, is it Hugo? [Enter Hugo. Why was he not admitted presently! You can be officious when you please. Leave us agen, and let none interrupt us, Honest Hugo. Hug. The business, Sir, is done. Dam. VVhat business? Hug. I have explor'd each Fibre of your Son. Dam. And How? and How? Hug. All things are well and in an excellent posture. Dam. Thou art i'th' dark. Hug. But I have brought to light a Plot, you'l Thank me for. Dam. A Plot? What is't? Hug. Your Son most violently proceeds to Cross Your interest in the Queen, and has most Impiously contriv'd away for her escape. Dam. He dares not? Her Escape? Hug. I skrew'd my self into his Soul, and he, In his Confidence of my honesty, would have Me carry a Letter to her. Dam. And didst thou? Hug. Yes, but had the Grace to break it open. Dam. Excellent. Hug. Which gave her to understand that this night By Virtue of the Word, a scrowl enclos'd, without Any difficulty she might pass the Guards. Dam. O Rebel, Traytor, It will be then necessary to Change the VVord immediately. Hug. Do not trouble your self Sir, I have sav'd that labour, For most artificially I trim'd up the Letter, and changing the Scrowl, baited their Ambition to be gone with a word of my Own divising; Did I not very well Sir? Dam. Admirably: I could kiss thee for't, Thou hast done A Service never to be sufficiently Rewarded. It tickles my spleen; Thou hast done rarely Hugo. Hug. In this one Act I have out-witted your Son, and it was high time to give his disobedience A Check, Clip'd the wings of his precious Pigeon, who is wild with the immagination of Taking the fresh Air; but when she finds her self In our snare, I hope she will be tame Enough, and stoop to any Conditions your Heat of blood will propound to her. Dam. The pleasure comes to fast: Ha, ha, ha. Now are they (having already swallow'd their Liberty) laughing at us.â Hug. To think how we are gull'd? I should have told You Sir, I have discover'd the Moor to be a Raschal, A near friend of hers; A saucy Sun-burnt Devil, And your Rival. Dam. The Sooty slave shall dye for't: Not all his black Relations in Hell shall rescue him: The evening Creeps upon us: I dare not trust the Aire with our Discourse, my Stars, I do forgive you all, y'are Kind; and next to them, I owe my thanks to The VVise, Honest Hugo: VVe'l be in at the Sport. Hug. By any means Sir, I must wait upon you, My presence will add much to their Vexation. Dam. The strength shall be recruited at each Guard. Hug. I canot but laugh to think how they will look upon me Sir, when they see themselves in the snare, And how the Moor will Blush Sir. Dam. Let's away: no change of Countenance: Carry all Smooth until the storm surprize 'em. [Exeunt. Enter Captain of the Guard, and a Serjeant. Cap. Where's the Corporal? Ser. He's ordering the Centries. Cap. So, 'tis well. Enter Corporal with two Souldiers. 1. Soul. Well: If I miscarry this bout Corporal, Ile lay My death at your door, that made me leave my Drink behind me. Corp. There's your spot: Two hours hence expect Releif, You may lye down and listen, but take heed, when The Round comes that you be not taken Napping, [Exit Corporal and two Souldiers. 1. Soul. I warrant you, in my first duty, I thank my Stars, (When I left my own Trade to follow Man-killing) I had a Benefit from my Fears, and could wake At the Motion of a Field-mouse, now I am an old Souldier, and us'd to't, I can do my duty in my Sleep: Rise, Bid stand: Ask who goes there? Have All my Questions and postures as ready as the Most waking Centry of 'em all. Capt. I had a Scurvy dream last night Serjeant. Ser. 'Tis well for you Captain. Capt. A Scurvy dream well for me? Why prethee? Ser. 'Tis well for you that you can dream: Time Was within our memory we have not slept In ten nights: hard duty, little drink, and no Pay, do not much Corroborate nature: But What was your dream Captain? Capt. Why, I dream't we had an Alarum given us, And that the Enemy (having taken our Redont Upon the River) were entring the Town, Against them I march'd; and at last, when I was Beset by a Party of theirs, and in The Condition of engaging with 'em: Two Rats That had a quarrel behind the Hangings in My Chamber, waken'd me. Ser. And so you came off? Enter Strato. Str. Where's the Captain of the Watch? Capt. Here Colonel. Str. I had Orders to Recruit the Guards to night. Capt. What Enemy? Str. I know not, but there is something expected. Capt. A pox on't, my dream's out: Come Serjeant, I attend you Colonel. [Exeunt omnes prÃ¦ter 1. Sould. Enter Cleander, Timandra, and Arisba. Clean. Look how the night's already drest, and for Thy fair attendance hath put on her best And brightest Lustre, while every Star (Though not with so much Sparkling as thy Eyes) Pays his willing shine to light thee To some more happy Coast. Tim. I cannot fear Success, while you are Conduct. Clean. Arisba, this last Act Will perfect thy fidelity, and make it Fit for Reward. Aris. Be confident of my duty: But Sir, contemn your self, I heard something Move; the Centry is near. Clean. Be careful of the Queen, I will approach And give the Word. 1. Sould. I hear a Voice: Stand: Ha! What's this? Clean. Call your Officer. 1. Sould. Corporal: by this moon-shine 'tis the Devil. Coporal: Come quickly and be damn'd, here's one Stays for you: I charge thee, come no nearer. Corporal, ha! So. Enter Corporal. I'le e'en leave you together, and Alarum the Guard. Corp. The Word. Clean. Siracuse. Corp. You are mistaken, and must along with me. Clean. Must Rascal? [They fight. The Guard's Alarum'd: I doubt we are betray'd [He kills the Corporal. Enter Souldiers: one Seizeth upon Timandra. Tim. Villain unhand me. Clean. It had been safer to have touch'd a falling Thunder-bolt. Enter Captain of the Guard. Capt. The Corporal kill'd?âThen 'tis time To try my Sword. [He also is beaten off by Cleander. [They fight; he makes 'em Retreat. Clean. We must face about. Enter Strato and Proclus with more Souldiers at one door. At the other Dionysius, Sicanus Dorion. Str. The Court's Alarum'd: where are these Traytors? Pro. Here. Str. Let's help to take 'em. Pro. Agreed; Souldiers, we assist your duties. Dioni. Whence this Alarum? Hiarbas and Timandra. There is no time for cold enquiries; Accept our Swords Hiarbas to your Service. Clean. Dionysius, can this be Real? There is some Hopes yet. Enter Parmenio and others. Dion. I think this Coast is safe. Clean. Had the Souldiers grow out of the Earth Like Cadmus Teeth, Defend the Queen on that hand, I on this. Dion. I cannot fall in a more glorious quarrel. Souldiers d'ee not know me? Pro. Dispatch: the King commands you Seize 'em. They fight. Strato and Proclus fall in the Skirmist. Sicanus and Dorion beaten off. Dionysius taken, and Cleander surpriz'd behind by Parmenio. Parm. Th'art a brave Moor Enter Damocles, Cleomenes, and Hugo. Dam. Where's the Queen? Tim. Here Tyrant. Dam. Ingrateful woman; was your Heat so mighty, None but this Son of night was fit to mix And walk Companion of your Love and Fortune? A Dog? a Moor? Clean. Thus Mungrils snarl at Lions: Damocles, 'Tis not our Crimes, nor any good the Gods Foresaw in thee, nor Valour of thy Guards, Nor our own Sleeping Stars, but thy great Sins, Not yet mature for Vengeance, hath made Our design fruitless. Dam. Ha! Dionysius! my Son turn'd Rebel? 'Tis time to check his Speed: And whose fine plot Was this? Tim. Sir, it was mine: I could not hope a Life here Without Stain to my Honour. Dam. And Madam you may dearly count for this. Clean. It was I contriv'd it. She does abuse her Innocence, let me That have a Soul prepar'd sustain the punishment. Dio. They have both accus'd themselves unjustly, The plot was mine, I must agen Repeat, But not Repent it, mine; I sent a Letter, And the Word enclos'd for their escape. Dam. You did?âCleomenes.â [Dam.] and Cleom. whisper. Hug. Sir, I desire no body may be Believ'd, but my self: The Plot was mine, the Cream, the Knack of It my own. Clean. Thine? Hug. Yes, and shall please thy Sooty Phisnomy. Dion. Cursed Villain. Hug. As sure as your Highness gave me your Letter to That Lady, which I deliver'd with my own Hand; But it was after I had broke it open, and made Bold to put the Change upon your own Trick.âAltering Only a word or so.â Clean. Remember he's your Son. Dam. Thus I blow off that name: I expect your duty: You need not Strive for your Rewards. Parm. I am commanded to attend you Sir to the Castle. Tim. I am sorry my unhappiness should thus Involve your danger; But I hope your Father Has a Reserve of kinder thoughts. Dio. Timandra, your fair Hand.âThis Kiss Is bought too cheap though I dye for you. Farewel noble Hiarbas. [Exit. Dam. Come nearer Moor: Dost thou not Read Death Within this Frown? Clean. I am above it Damocles: Keep those Bugs Upon thy Brow to fright tame Fools, and such As born from Worms do Crawl about thy Court, And lick thy dusty Pavements: Snakes that live And lap the blood of Innocents: I despise Thy mercy to my self; But if thou hast A sense of Honour, or of any thing That's man within thee, Look with softer Eyes On this distressed Queen. Dam. Yes, your Mistris? Clean. Ambition cannot aim at greater Honour. Dam. This saucy Competition (Hadst thou no other Crime) shall make thee Curse Thou hast a Being. Clean. Saucy Competition with thee? Thy Pride Provokes my Smile: I tell thee Damocles, Thou mayst by number, and thy Crouds of men, Steal an Inglorious Victory: But were Our Persons singly arm'd, and we two plac'd Upon a Cliff, or some Star-kissing mountain: All thy abused Legions round about us Staring to see us fight for Love and Honour: The Gods should not be weary to look down, And thy own Armies undeceiv'd should Judge Who best deserv'd Timandra. Omnes, This Moor has a brave Soul. Clean. But I loose breath in talking to a man Whose very Soul's a Coward, and his Heart False as his Title to the Crown. Dam. No more: We'l try how he can talk without a Head: The morning Sees him dye: For her.â One Convoy serve 'em both, and look you trifle not With my Commands as you will keep your Head on. Thus all my Troubles vanish; I was never A King till now. Hug. I hope you'l take my word another Time. [Exeunt Damacles and Hugo. Cleo. Madam, I grieve for your misfortune. Clean. For thy self Cleomenes: And yet thou hadst An honest Fame. Cleo. You do not know me Sir. Clean. But I forgive thee: Come, mourn not Timandra. Tim. I should not weep were we to dye together. Clean. 'Tis not Resolv'd above so; do not envy me As man to lead the way: 'Tis my Honour To bleed a chearful Martyr to thy Love. Forgive me if I hope thou mayst not stay Too long behind: For when I shall arrive Among those blest Shades; and have my Seat Where only good inhabits: Yet I fear I shall not think it Heaven till thou art there. Conduct now where you please. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Enter Parmenio and Calanthe. Cal. Thou hast told me a sad Story: the Queen's made A Prisoner? and Hiarbas doom'd to loose His Head this mourning? They are then both As miserable as I: But she is firm I see to her Honour. How does he bear himself? Parm. With a most manly Temper, not i'th' least Dejected for his thought of suffering Death, But as it separates Timandra from him; For 'tis presum'd they Lov'd. Cal. Her knowledge of His worth may make the Cloud upon his Face More lovely to her Eyes. But how doth She Take this affliction? Parm. At first most sadly; And yet his Courage and his wisdom has Almost perswaded her to part with him. Cal. Might I not see him before he dye? Parm. He made it his request to my Lord Cleomenes, That he might Visit you, petending something That might concern you and himself. Cal. On that account I wish he were permitted. Parm. His stay will be but short. [Exit Parm. Cal. I limit not the Favour, and shall thank you, I wonder I have been so long forgotten In the Usurpers anger, but his Fury When it does fall perhaps will recompence The slow approach it makes. Enter Cleander, and Parmenio. Sir, I am told you would speak with me. Clea. Yes, sweet Youth. Cal. Your business pray with me? Clean. I must be thrifty of my Time, my Life wonot Allow us many minutes, and I would not Put off this earth without a peace about me. I come to Ask thy Pardon. Cal. How! My pardon? You never Injur'd me. Clea. Yes Polydore, I did abuse thy Innocence. Cal. Not mine. Clea. And gave thee up To my own thoughts an impious Boy, when I Conceiv'd thee late a wicked Agent from The Usurper to the Queen: But she has told me Since, a large volume of thy Virtue, That I am oblig'd to carry thy Forgiveness, Or doubt my Passage to a better World. Cal. Sir, I have Charity to pardon all The ill you thought of me. Clea. I thank thee, and trust me, if I were to live I would study thee a better Recompence Then naked Prayers: But as it is, I wish Thou maist out-live the Tyrants malice, Farewel. Cal. Is this all? Clea. I should say something, from the Queen, of sorrow, That for her sake thou suffer'st, But when I'm dead She'l tell the all at large. Cal. Pray tell me Sir, Do you expect to die so soon? Clea. I know not, The precise minute, but cannot think I have Many more to tell that number time, but By a Tyrants glass. Cal. And can you part with Life so evenly? How did you work this noble mastery Upon your Soul? I wish I may do so, When the approaching minute Comes. Clea. It is an ease to die: a Blessing Boy. Cal. My bless: The choise part of my Life is gone Before, yet I am confin'd to a tedious Life And make no hast to follow it, But 'tis The Tyrants fault not mine. Clea. Thou wert then in Love too. Cal. Heaven will forgive me, if I say, I lov'd A Brother, in whose life was all my Comfort But Death snatch'd him away maliciously, I know not where, nor how. Clea. His Name I prethee. Cal. You shall excuse that, you are a stranger And will not be at all concern'd to know him, But here is all that's left him, his shadow, [Shews the Picture. Which when his cruel Fortune call'd him from me, He gave me a Companion in his absence, But that my tears are pious to his memory; The frequent Drops, and kisses, I have paid it, Might have long since defac'd and drown'd the Image. Clea. My labouring Soul: The very same I gave [Aside. Calanthe, 'tis my Sister, but I must not Discover. Cal. You are troubled. Clea. Polydore. [He restores the Picture. There is some secret magick in thy Sorrow Makes me forget my own: If I could think The Tyrant would not punish thee with Life Too long, I'de wish to stay and tarry for Thy company that we might die together. Enter Timandra, and seeing them, stands at some distance. Thou art young, and by the example of my dying I would instruct thee to a Flight above The worlds Ambition, and though I be A stranger here, there we should be acquainted, Where we might live and love to all Eternity. Tim. What do I hear? Cal. The Queen Sir: [Cal. spies the Queen. Clea. Ha! Timandra, I am but The shadow of my self: those two divide All that I was between 'em. Art thou come! I'le tell the Secret, Polydore's a woman; A Princess my Timandra, One that lov'd me Before my Happiness of knowing thee, And yet I dare not tell her who I am Though a dear part of my self; nor dare I kiss her For fear my Soul dissolve upon her Lip. Cal. He has some strange Contention in his Breast. Tim. What killing Language do I hear? Have I for this made forfeit of a Kingdom, And what is dearer, Liberty? Puld on me A Tyrants Rage, and given my heart to one That in my presence owns another Mistriss? Clea. I see the Clouds are gathering to make A storm within thee: Let one word disperse 'em: It is Calanthe, my dear long lost Sister. Tim. And will you not uncloud your self to her? Clea. Take heed. Cal. I canot blame their passions high at parting. [Aside. Clea. It were a wickedness the Gods Would never pardon, Ile give the a Reason: She knows I am to die; O let me vanish I'th' dark: for but to tell her I am Cleander That must within few minutes bow my Neck T'th' Hang-mans Ax, to please a bloody Tyrant, 'Twould strik her dead immediately before us, And I should be her Murtherer: No Timandra, Let the Usurpers Soul own all that guilt, When I am past the miseries of Life, Ile tell the Angels, who are coming after, And that's enough. Tim. I would say something, Speaking to Calanthe. But so many Seas of sorrow meet within mee, They drown my Tongue and Heart. Enter Cleomenes Reading a Paper. Attendant. Cleom. Your duties. 1. Atten. I am commanded to attend you, Madam, To your Chamber. Tim. Where you please. [Exit. 2. Atten. Sir, I have Orders to wait upon you. Clean. Thou call'st me to my death, 'tis welcome. [Exit. Cleom. Madam, your Retirement is concern'd. Cal. How soon, we are all divided? [Exit. Cleom. She must not know this Warrant for her death: He has remembred her at last; Let Polydore dye to morrow Timandra will be next, and then his Son, [Reads. And then my Head brings up the Rear, I see The method of his Tiranny. Enter Parmenio. Parm. Sir, I am very much Importun'd by the Moor, Hiarbas Servant, now your Prisoner. Cleom. To what? Parm. To let him speak with you: He says he will discover Something to your private Ear you'l thank him for: A secret will be wellcome to the King, And worth his pardon, if you will promote it. Cleom. Prithee admit him. [Exit Parmenio, and enter with Arisba. Have you any thing to say To me? Aris. My Lord, I have something to reveal to your Lordship, And in Hope you will mediate for my pardon.â Cleom. Be brief. Aris. There is a person in the World. Cleom. One person in the World? take him away, The Fellow trifles, and is tedious. Aris. Not so quick; I'le come to the Business. My Lord, I'le tell you: The Gentleman you Call Hiarbas. Cleom. What of him? Aris. Is no such man: No Moor. Cleom. How! Aris. No more then your Lordship; these hands temper'd The Ingredients, that gave him the Complexion He wears; I dare not speak too loud: It is the King Sir. Cleom. Ha! the King! Aris. King Cleander. Cleom. Make it good, and be for ever Happy. Aris. I knew it would be wellcome news; upon my Most certain knowledge he has walk'd in that Obscurity, since the Defeat he had i'th' Battle: The Queen only knows of it, beside my self; There are few could have kept a Secret so long, And so sweet, as I have done; but the fear Of Hanging has had the better of my Conscience. Cleom. Thy Liberty is too little Recompence For such a Service; The King shall Honour thee. Aris. Nay, let him give me what he will beside, I hope You do not conceive that I have done this out Of any ill Principle, only the Gallows Was too strong for my Imagination. Cleom. Art sure this is not Reveal'd to any else? Aris. Upon my Life your Lordship is the first. Cleom. Then I'le take course to be the last: It shall go no further. [Cleomenes kills Arisba. Aris. Oh. Cleom. Take thy Reward base Villain: Betray thy King and Master? Parmenio, throw him Into that Lobby; and dost Hear, cut off his Head, I shall have use on't: So, good Heavens I thank you, Parmenio, we have much to do. [Exit without Parmenio. Enter Timandra and her Attendant. Tim. I thank you Sir, only I shall Request This favour, when Hiarbas with his Blood Hath satisfied the Thrist of Damocles, That you would bring me word. Serv. I shall. [Exit. Tim. That news may give a period to my Life, And break my Heart: What benefit have Princes To be born great? To have a name and power Above the common Tribe for a few minutes? When they'r expos'd to the same Strokes of Fortune, Which renders them but still the more unhappy; And their fall so much the greater, as they are Thrown from the taller Precipice. Enter Attendants. Atten. Madam, the Prince Dionysius, by some favour Of my Lord Cleomenes, is come to visit you. Tim. Alas! this is no season for a Visit; And yet he has deserv'd all my Civilities. I pray admit him. Enter Dionysius. Dion. Pardon, dear Madam, that I have presum'd To make intrusion upon your Sorrow: I have only to present you my sad Heart, That sees and mourns your Fate. Enter Cleomenes hastily. Cleom. Madam, the King is come into the Castle; Sir, as you weigh my Safety or your own, You must not be seen here: That way you'l meet him; You may Obscure (I know not where) within That Bed-chamber, his Jealousie at your Sight, Will turn him into a Flame to all our Ruins. Dion. You shall perswade: Though it be worse than death To shew this Fear. Cleom. For the Queens Honour there Sir; I hear him [Dionysius obscures. Coming up the Staires; One word more Madam, I dare not trust your tender Heart [To Tim. Without a Caution, let no Object fright you, Hiarbas shall be safe upon my Honour, By your fair self he shall, until you speak with him. Enter Damocles and Hugo. Is't done? Cleom. He is dispatch'd Sir; You ne'r shall see his Face agen. Dam. Not see it, I must Cleomenes, therefore when I send for't Let it be ready. Hugo attend. Cleom. 'Tis at your Service Sir. [Exit Cleom. and Hugo. Dam. What says the fair Defier now? Have you consider'd? And throw off all your unbecoming Wildness, The very thought and memory of Hiarbas, Or any other that durst take the Boldness To offer at Affection as my Rival? Are all your sullen humors tam'd and vanish'd? And in that stubborn Heart have I a name? Lord of that Empire by thy Choise and Gift To my desert? This I expect to hear, Or nothing, and that too without much preface. This is a new and shorter cut of woing Than I have us'd: But since t'hast Slighted all My kinder ways, Anger is only left To instruct thee how to Love? Say, and be brief. Tim. Then briefly thus; Know I do hate thy Love, As much as I despise thy Anger, Tyrant. And had I guilt but of one loving Thought Within my Heart to thee, I'de say, That Honour there had bid farewel, and left Me fit to be a Prey to Falshood. I have not been much tedious in my Answer. Dam. You have been nimble I confess, but I will Use the same Brevity: Bid Cleomenes send in Hiarbas Head? Tim. Hiarbas Head? Dam. A Present for you Madam. Enter Hugo with the Moors Head cover'd. Tim. False Cleomenes. Dam. His lips are cold, And want much of that noble Heat, wherewith They were wont to entertain you Madam. Tim. Inhumane Tyrant! Dam. I will not leave any thing alive that loves thee, My Son is next: But now I thing on't Madam, I have not done yet: I wo'not leave, Till I have made thee leprous and unfit For any mans Embrace: Come, you know the way To your Bed-chamber: Move, or I'le drag thee to it.

Lay down your Fears of an Usurping Tyrant, Whose Lust of Empire hath committed such Horrid and high Impieties, I tremble But to Remember: And at the last hath added Unto his many Paricides, the murther Of his own Son: A Person that was only Unhappy, that he had so vile a Father. Who though not at present dead; Yet,â Omn. Sen. How, not dead? Cleom. Not dead Fathers, but by the Providence of Heaven, that heard our prayers, he is now Within your power, and timely shall appear To be the Object of your Justice first. 1. Sen.

Clean. Most Honour'd Subjects, I read firm Loyalty in every Face, I should else think the Crown a Burthen to me.

What I should think, if she were not your Sister, Were soon resolv'd; She is the wonder of her Sex: A Princess To be with Reverence look'd on a far off. Clea. My Lord, if I should bring her nearer to you. Cleo. She is in my Soul already. Clean. Come Calanthe, I see thou only canst Reward Cleomenes And nothing else left worthy of his Faith And Honour: I must give thy self to him. Take her Cleomenes from me: your Hearts will meet And make no difference. Cal. I Confirm my Brothers gift Cleomenes: Thy Blood is from the Race of noblest Ancestors, Thy Virtue makes the greater: and let Envy Talk it self dumb, thou dost deserve a Princess, And shall't be Read in story to thy Honour, When some that boast great Empires shall have dark And common Mention. Cleom. 'Tis too much Grace. Clean. The Command Of all our Forces both by Sea and Land Are thine, with what can be hereafter found Worthy of thy Desert, and fit to add unto Calanthes Dowry. Cleom.

Ask the King mercy: Speak for your self Hugo. Hug. To what purpose? Let me say what I will, I Knew they will hang me. [They lead him off. Dam.

I thank your good advice my Lord. Cleom. And in their number let me, Sir, present (To kiss your Hand) this noble Gentleman, Son of the Lord Demaratus; who Bleed A Martyr for you. Cal. He was my second Father. Clean. And my Friend: you shall be [Parmenio kisses the Kings Hand. Restor'd both to his Honour and his Fortunes, Beside the Addition of some employment (That may be worthy) near our Person. Cleo. What shall be done with Dionysius Body? Clean.

      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE TO THE USURPER. The Moral use of Plays, does make us know Actions, which virtues Raise, and vice lay Low: Teaching the Bad, though even dead, to fear They may be Reviv'd, to be punish'd here. As now this Play, by some such Magick Call Has rais'd a bold Usurper up, to Fall. And if I may advise you Gentlemen, Faith let him live, if but to dye agen. His Crime was horrid, and it is not fit, One death of the Usurper Expiate it: Let him dye often, He's content that way, Still to be punish'd, so you'l spare the Play Which by our Authors aim was meant to be Here, a Record of all such Loyalty; That after long Contests, did safely bring, Subjects to Rights, and to his Throne our King.</field>
