      <field name="fulltext">WILLIAM TELL; OR, THE CIVIL WAR IN SWITZERLAND. A DRAMA FOR THE PEOPLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Characters. AUSTRIANS. Gesler, the original Austrian butcher. (Not likely to be quarrelled for by the actors, as he is unquestionably the worst character in the drama.) Policeman A 21, his Official Representative. Guards, Attendants, Police, &amp;c. SWISS. William Tell, a Demagogue in a constant state of Agitation. Verner, Repealer. Furst, Repealer. Michael, Repealer. Albert, Tell's Son.—(The original Merry Swiss Boy.) Peasants, Blackguards, Hereditary Bondsmen, &amp;c. Scene—Switzerland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE THE FIRST. A romantic pass, somewhere out in the cold. Verner, solus, trying to warm himself, by blowing on his fingers. Ver. It's time the sub-committee met, that's clear; I've got no watch, although I keep one here, And so can't tell the time. Had I a ticker I'd tell it—to move on a little quicker. Here's Furst, at last. I thought I heard his shout. Enter Furst. Fur. I'm warm with walking. Ver. Ah! I'm cold without. Where's Michael? Fur. All behind, of course; the bore! Ver. Behind! He promised to be here by four. Hast met Bill Tell? Fur. No, Verner; no such treat. Bills in these times are difficult to meet. But see; here's Michael. Enter Michael. Ver. Welcome, Mike! Mic. Alas! It seems we've all come to this precious Pass. Ver. Your news? Mic. The Daily News! It's all alike. Wouldst hear it? Ver. To be sure. Fur. Cut away, Mike. Mic. Gesler, whose tyranny knows ne'er a truce, Still rules the roast, and cooks the Switzer's goose, With corn and malt tax makes the quarterns dear, And robs the poor man of his cherish'd beer (For the once merry Swiss boy of the vale No longer of a morning “takes his pale”). With new Wrongs, Outrages, Coercion Bills, Each late edition of the papers thrills: Cabins, in flames, our native mountains crowd; Cabins, where smoking shouldn't be allow'd: Business is at a stand-still—stocks are falling; The daily emigration's quite appalling. This social problem puzzles every one; For us—the People! what is to be done? Tell. (Outside.) Holloa! Ver. Our leader comes! my friends rejoice. Mic. He sings out bravely. Fur. Yes; he's got a voice— All throat, though. In these times—he's so distress'd, He's not a single good note in his chest; Yet for his skill in planning revolution, Few Austrians would blame his execution. Enter Tell in a great-coat and woollen comforter. Tell. My friends and patriots, I hope you're well. Ver. How fares our liberator?—William—tell. Tell. (Unwinding his comforter.) Striving the chilling influence to prevent, Of this, the winter of our discontent; Though, thanks to tyrants, for our blood who've thirsted, Our only bosom comforters are worsted! But we're all here—for business, let's prepare. Mic. I move that William Tell do take the chair. Tell. (Bitterly.) Chairs, stools, all! Gesler's bailiffs from us wrench, Till nought is left for Switzers but the Bench! No matter though; to work—which is the chair? Ver. Sit on that rail instead. Tell. What, that one there? It's not a first-class rail, but it'll do. Now who begins the evening's business? Mic. You! Move on. Tell. I shan't; I'm comfortable here. Mic. Stuff! Make a motion. Tell. Now you're meaning's clear. [Mr. Tell rises to address the meeting. Hereditary bondsmen! Don't you know that, Who would be free, themselves must strike the— Mic. Blow that! Try something new. Tell. Oh! certainly. Here goes! The haughty Gesler's domineering nose I'll soon disjoint; remove our country's curse, Or die upon the floor of— Mic. (Disgusted.) Worse and worse. Tell. Then here's a proposition—that a rent Shall be collected—something large per cent. On what the people really have n't got. Mic. Ah! now, I own, you seem to know what's what. Fur. I like the plan extremely, I confess. Ver. I'll be collector with great willingness. Fur. But when we've got it, how should it be spent? Tell. As Mrs. Glass would say, first catch your rent. We four, the spending of it, will enforce. Ver. The resolution's carried then? All. Of course. Fur. Then let's dissolve. Tell. (Lachrymously.) A motion to my mind, For to the melting mood I feel inclined. Mic. Then we break up. Tell. Let's mind and not break down. I must be off, they're wanting me in town. Ver. Then is the evening's business finished? Mic. Quite. Tell. Carried unanimously. Gents, good night. [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE THE SECOND. The market place at Altorf—In the centre a new four-and-ninepenny hat (in the original brown paper and string) is elevated on the top of a pole. Citizens cross the stage and bow to it. Policeman A 21, in full uniform, exerts his truncheon and authority to bring the people (several of whom are refractory) to their knees. CONCERTED—(A 21 and Chorus.) (Tune—The Row Polka.) Bow! bow! bow! bow! bow! Down upon your/our marrow bones. Now! now! now! Now! now! you'd/we'd best, I vow. Ri tol de riddle iddle, bow! wow! wow! SOLO (A 21). (To another Air.) “All round my hat I would have them bow and kneel, oh!” (Such was the words which Gesler used to me to day;) “And if any body axes you, The reason why I rears it— You can tell 'em they may go to Bath, or further still away!” [He loses himself in a cadence, but is recalled to a sense of duty. Chorus (resumed). Bow! Bow! &amp;c. A 21. Haste to the pole! [Tell crosses the stage, taking no notice of the hat. Now, then, where are you off to? Tell. Dinner. A 21. Quick! yonder hat, your bonnet doff to. Tell. Bow to a hat? A 21. Yes! need no more reproof! Remove your tile when under Gesler's roof. [Points to hat. Tell. Gesler's! I see. He'll drive the people mad— Bow to his hat! it's really shocking bad. A 21. (Pointing to the ground.) Down! with the dust; or else I'll make you, clown! Tell. Not e'en Sir Peter's self shall put me down. A 21. If in this rudeness you persist, I'll stop it— So, if you've any court'sy, please to drop it. Tell. My cup of anguish over 'gins to swim, Fill'd by yon hat—yes, to its very brim! (Firmly) Kneel to a hat, from Gesler's greasy pole: No! on my feet I'll stand—aye, on my soul! And thou, vile post! I'll smash thee all to shivery: All Switzerland shall bless this Post Delivery. [He rushes to the side, and fetches an axe, with which he chops the pole down. Great confusion—which may be taken advantage of, by any wag in the audience, to make a joke about the Pole being one of the Distressed Poles. Thus would that I could make the Austrian thieves Cut all their sticks, and never axe their leaves. A 21. (Coming forward.) He's broke the whole on't! let alone the peace. A voice within me calls “Police!” “Police!” True as the needle to yon pole, I'll boast— A—Twenty-one—would not desert his post. [He springs his rattle. Policemen appear from the neighbouring kitchens, and surround Tell. CHORUS (resumed). How! how! here's a row! Drag him to the station—Now! now! now! How! how! refuse to bow? Ri tol di riddle iddle—Bow! wow! wow! [Tell is vanquished, and dragged off in custody.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONCERTED—(A 21 and Chorus.) (Tune—The Row Polka.) Bow! bow! bow! bow! bow! Down upon your/our marrow bones. Now! now! now! Now! now! you'd/we'd best, I vow. Ri tol de riddle iddle, bow! wow! wow! SOLO (A 21). (To another Air.) “All round my hat I would have them bow and kneel, oh!” (Such was the words which Gesler used to me to day;) “And if any body axes you, The reason why I rears it— You can tell 'em they may go to Bath, or further still away!” [He loses himself in a cadence, but is recalled to a sense of duty. Chorus (resumed). Bow! Bow! &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE THE THIRD. The Austrian Camp—Gesler reading the paper. Tell is brought in handcuffed, guarded by A 21 and auxiliaries, the populace following. Ges. What's this? Another case of beer?—I see: Fine him five shillings, and don't bother me. Yet, stay! that haughty form and features bold! Who art thou, slave? Tell. I'm Tell. Ges. So I am told. How old are you? Tell. Why, forty! as I'm guessing. Ges. (To his Clerk.) Write “Forty—and of looks unprepossessing.” Your business? Tell. If my trade you would inquire, I draw the long bow— Ges. (Aside.) Now he is a liar. You've learnt to read? Mind you're before your betters. Tell. Read! Well, I'll let you know I know my letters. SONG (Tell.) (Tune—Derry down.) A, was an Archer, who shot at a frog, B, was a Butcher, who went the whole hog. C, the Contempt that B brought on his place, D, the Defiance A hurl'd in his face. Down, derry down, &amp;c. Ges. I know you well, and what you're always arter, Lecturing folks about the People's Charter, From casks and platforms; thundering and bawling With all your lungs; a most disgraceful calling. But what's he charged with? Law I'll soon dispense! A 21. Contempt of hat. Ges. A capital offence! Yet stay—those Bluchers! that indignant pose! That look! that eagle eye! and parrot nose! He's very like that little vulgar boy, Whom, dressed in button-over corduroy, I've had lock'd up for crying “whip behind” As I rode out. Ho! Justice is n't blind. I see a way to make this tough one tender. Before us place the juvenile offender! [Albert is brought in, guarded. Alb. (Aside, recognising Tell.) Dad! I'll not own him, though! the deuce a bit; Though torn in half, I wo'nt be made to split. Tell. (Aside.) My Albert! Ges. Let's examine him forthwith. Your name, boy? Alb. Albert. Ges. Albert what? Alb. (Winking at his father.) Hem! Smith. Ges. Ah! that wo'nt do. Feel in his pockets, quick! [A 21 searches Albert's pockets. A 21. Two tops, an apple, and a half-sucked stick Of barley-sugar. Ges. Stop! give us a bit. This spoil becomes the conq'ror's perquisite. [Sucking the barley sugar. A 21 is proceeding to bite the apple; Gesler snatches it from him. Stop! no, you do n't, my buck; that's ours as well. We mean to have some fun with it. Here, Tell. Tell. I am here. Ges. Of your jokes pray have a care, Your whereabouts is neither here nor there. You ought to die—but yet I do n't mind giving You and your son a chance to earn a living. Tell. You're very kind; anything I can do— Ges. We want to see a little sport; so you At fifty yards off, with an arrow straight, Must shoot this apple from young Albert's pate. Tell. (Agonized.) That apple! What, is this your mercy's fruit? No! rather, upon me, your own bolts shoot. Think you your tyrant powers me can force To cook his infant goose—with apple sauce? Alb. Nay pa; I'm game. Tell. Could I make game of thee I would preserve, not shoot thee. Alb. Why shoot me? You'll hit the apple— Tell. (Maudlin.) He—his mother's joy! She's always saying, “Tell, do n't hit that boy. How, with maternal anguish, would she cry out, To see him homeward going—with his eye out. (With a sigh of resignation.) But it's my dear boy's wish, I must not foil him, Though p'rhaps, through my indulgence, I may spoil him. [Albert is led out by A 21, holding the apple. Tell takes his bow and his aim. Slay my own son! Our dearest friends to shoot us; My hair stands straight—I feel a perfect Brutus. Alb. (Outside.) All right, my venerable. Do n't say die. Ges. Go it my pippin! Tell. Albert, mind your eye! [He shoots. A shout of triumph. Tell falls into somebody's arms—it is immaterial whose. Ges. He's sent a hole through it. Come, that's a bore! Alb. (Running in with the apple, the arrow sticking in it.) He's pierced the rosy apple to the core. Ges. Rosy! young upstart. Come, that's like your cheek. Well, for your life you've had an arrow squeak. (Aside.) They'll doubtless claim our promise to be hooking. We can't be off it well. Alb. (Aside.) There's no one looking. [Commences eating the apple. Tell. I've paid my shot, so p'raps you'll let me go. Ges. But there's an old score not yet clear'd, you know. Say, if you'd missed it, what would you have done? Tell.
