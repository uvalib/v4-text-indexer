Nowe god be here who kepeth this place Now by my fayth I crye you mercy Of reason I must sew for grace My rewdnes sheweth me no so homely Wherof your pardon axt and wonne I sew you as curtesy doth me bynde To tell thys whiche shalbe begonne In order as may come beste in myndy I am a palmer as ye se Whiche of my lyfe much part hath spent In many a fayre and farre countre As pylgrymes do of good intent At Hierusalem haue I bene Be fore Chrystes blessed sepulture The mount of Caluery haue I sene A holy place ye may be sure To Iosophat and Olyuete On fote god wote I wente ryght bare Many a salt tere dyde I swete Before thys carkes coulde come there Yet haue I bene at Rome also And gone the stacions all arow Saynt peters shryne and many mo Then yf I tolde all ye do know Except that there be any suche That hath ben there and diligently Hath taken hede and marked muche Then can they speke as muche as I Then at the Rodes also I was And rounde about to amyas At saynt Toncomber and saynt Tronion At saynt Bothulph and saynt Anne of Buckston On the hylles of Armony where I see Noes arke With holy Iob and saynt George in Suthwarke At Waltam and at Walsyngam And at the good rood of dagnam At saynt Cornelys at saynt Iames in Gales And at saynt Wynefrydes well in Walles At our lady of Boston at saynt Edmundes byry And streyght to saynt Patrykes purgatory At rydybone and at the blood of Hayles Where pylgrymes paynes ryght muche auayles At saynt Dauys and at saynt Denis At saynt Mathew and saynt Marke in Uenis At mayster Iohan shorne at Canterbury The graet god of Katewade at kynge Henry At saynt sauyours at our lady of Southwell At Crome at Wylsdome and at Muswell At saynt Rycharde and at saynt Roke And at our lady that standeth in the oke To these with other many one Deuoutly haue I prayed and gone Prayeng to them to pray for me Unto the blessed trynyte By whose prayers and my dayly payne I truste the soner to obtaye For my saluacyon grace and mercy For be ye sure I thynke surely Who seketh sayntes for Crystes sake And namely suche as payne do take On fote to punyshe thy frayle body Shall therby meryte more hyely Then by any thynge done by man Pardoner. And when ye haue gone as farre as ye can For all your labour and gostely entente Yet welcome home as wyse as ye wente Palmer. Why syr dyspyse ye pylgrymage Pardoner. Nay for god syr then dyd I rage I thynke ye ryght well occupyed To seke these sayntes on euery syde Also your payne I nat disprayse it But yet I discomende your wit And or we go euen so shall ye If ye in this wyl answere me I yray you shew what the cause is Ye wente al these pylgrymages Palmer. Forsoth this lyfe I dyd begyn To rydde the bondage of my syn For whiche these sayntes rehersed or this I haue both sought and sene Iwys Besechynge them to be recorde Of all my payne vnto the lorde That gyueth all remyssyon Upon eche mans contricyon And by theyr good mediacyon Upon myne humble submyssion I trust to haue in very dede For my soule helth the better spede. Pardonar. Nowe is your owne confessyon lyckely To make your selfe a fole quyckely For I perceyue ye wolde obtayne No nother thynge for all your payne But onely grace your soule to saue Nowe marke in this what wyt ye haue To seke so farre and helpe so nye Euen here at home is remedy. For at your dore my selfe doth dwell Who coulde haue saued your soule as well As all your wyde wandrynge shall do Though ye wente thryes to Iericho Nowe syns ye myght haue spedde at home What haue ye wone by ronnyng at Rome. Palmer. If this be true that ye haue moued Then is my wyt in dede reproued But let vs here fyrste what ye are Pardonar. Truly I am a pardoner. Palmer. Truely a pardoner that may be true But a true pardoner doth nat ensew Ryght selde is it sene or neuer. That treuth and pardoners dwell together For be your pardons neuer so great Yet them to enlarge ye wyll nat let With suche lyes that oftymes Cryste wot Ye seme to haue that ye haue nat Wherfore I went my selfe to the selfe thynge In euery place and without faynynge Had as muche pardon there assuredly As ye can promyse me here doutefully Howe be it I thynke ye do but scofte But yf ye hadde all the pardon ye kepe of And no whyt of pardon graunted In any place where I haue haunted Yet of my labour I nothynge repent. God hathe respect how eche tyme is spent And as in his knowlege all is regarded So by his goodnes all is rewarded Pardonar. By the fyrste parte of this laste tale It semeth you come late from the ale For reason on your syde so farre doth fayle That ye leue sonyng and begyn to rayle Wherin ye forget your owne parte clerely For ye be as vntrue as I And in one poynte ye are beyonde me For ye may lye by aucthoryte And all that hath wandred so farre That no man can be theyr controller And where ye esteme your labour so muche I say yet agayne my pardons be suche That yf there were a thousande soules on a hepe I wolde brynge them all to heuen as good chepe As ye haue brought your selfe on pylgrymage In the leste quarter of your vyage Whiche is farre a thys syde heuen by god There your labour and pardon is od With smale cost and without any payne These pardons bryngeth them to heuen playne Geue me but a peny or two pens And as sone as the soule departeth hens In halfe an houre or thre quarters at moste The soule is in heuen with the holy ghost Potycary. Sende ye any soules to heuen by water Pardoner. If we dyd syr what is the mater Potycary. By god I haue a drye soule shulde thyther I praye you let our soules go to heuen togyther So bysy you twayne be in soules helth May nat a potycary come in by stelth Yes that I wyll by saynt Antony And by the leue of thys company Proue ye false knaues bothe or we goo In parte of your sayenges as thys lo Thou by thy trauayle thynkest heuen to gete And thou by pardons and relyques countest no lete To sende thyne owne soule to heuen sure And all other whome thou lyste to procure If I toke an accyon then were they blanke For lyke theues the knaues rob away my thanke All soules in heuen hauynge relefe Shall they thanke your craftes nay thanke myn chefe No soule ye knowe entreth heuen gate Tyll from the bodye he be separate And whome haue ye knowen dye hostlye Without helpe of the potycary Nay all that commeth to our handlynge Except ye happe to come to hangynge That way perchaunce ye shall nat myster To go to heuen without a glyster But be ye sure I wolde be wo If ye shulde chaunge to begyle me so As good to lye with me a nyght As hange abrode in the mone lyght There is no choyse to fle my hande But as I sayd into the bande Syns of our soules the multitude I sende to heuen when all is vewed Who shulde but I then all togyther Haue thanke of all theyr commynge thyther Pardoner. If ye kylde a thousande in an houre space When come they to heuen dyenge from state of grace Potycary. If a thous?de pardons about your neckes were teyd When come they to heuen yf they neuer dyed Palmer. Longe lyfe after good workes in dede Doth hynder mannes receyt of mede And deth before one dewty done May make vs thynke we dye to sone Yet better tary a thynge then haue it Then go to sone and vaynly craue it Pardoner. The longer ye dwell in communicacion The lesse shall you lyke thys ymagynacyon For ye may perceyue euen at the fyrst chop Your tale is trapt in such a stop That at the leste ye seme worse then we Potycary. By the masse I holde vs nought all thre Pedler. By our lady then haue I gone wronge And yet to be here I thought longe Potycary. Brother ye haue gone wronge no wyt I prayse your fortune and your wyt That can dyrecte you so discretely To plante you in this company Thou palmer and thou a pardoner I a potycary. Pedler. And I a pedler Potycary. Nowe on my fayth full well watched Were the deuyll were we foure hatched Pedler. That maketh no mater syns we be matched I coulde be mery yf that I catchyd Some money for parte of the ware in my packe Potycary. What the deuyll hast thou there at thy backe Pedler. Why dost thou nat knowe that euery pedled In euery tryfull must be a medler Specyally in womens tryflynges Those vse we chefe aboue all thynges Whiche thynges to se yf ye be disposed Beholde what ware here is disclosed Thys gere sheweth it selfe in suche bewte That eche man thynketh it sayth come bye me Loke were your selfe can lyke to be chooser Your selfe shall make pryce though I be looser Is here nothynge for my father Palmer Haue ye nat a wanton in a corner For your walkyng to holy places By cryste I haue herde of as straunge cases Who lyueth in loue or loue wolde wynne Euen at this packe he must begynne Where is ryght many a proper token Of whiche by name parte shall be spoken Gloues, pynnes, combes, glasses vnspottyd Pomanders, hookes, and lasses knotted Broches, rynges, and all maner bedes Lace rounde and flat for womens hedes Nedyls, threde thymbell, shers, and all suche knackes Where louers be no suche thynges lackes Sypers swathbondes rybandes and sleue laces Gyrdyls, knyues, purses, and pyncases. Potycary. Do women bye theyr pyncases of you. Pedler. Ye that they do I make god a vow Potycary. So mot I thryue then for my parte I be shrewe thy knaues nakyd herte For makynge my wyfe ys pyncase so wyde The pynnes fall out they can nat abyde Great pynnes must she haue one or other Yf she lese one she wyll fynde an other Wherin I fynde cause to complayne New pynnes to her pleasure and my payne Pardoner. Syr ye seme well sene in womens causes I praye you tell me what causeth this That women after theyr arysynge Be so longe in theyr apparelynge Pedler. Forsoth women haue many lettes And they be masked in many nettes As frontlettes, fyllettes, parlettes, and barcelettes And then theyr bonettes and theyr poynettes By these lettes and nettes the lette is suche That spede is small whan haste is muche. Potycary. An other cause why they come nat forwarde Whiche maketh them dayly to drawe backwarde And yet is a thynge they can nat forbere The trymmynge and pynnynge vp theyr gere Specyally theyr fydlyng with the tayle pyn And when they wolde haue it prycke in If it chaunce to double in the clothe Then be they wode and swereth an othe Tyll it stande ryght they wyll nat forsake it Thus though it may nat yet wolde they make it But be ye sure they do but defarre it For when they wolde make it ofte tymes marre it But prycke them and pynne them as nyche, as ye wyll And yet wyll they loke for pynnynge styll So that I durste holde you a ioynt Ye shall neuer haue them at a fall poynt Pedler. Let womens maters passe and marke myne What euer theyr poyntes be, these poyntes be fyne Wherfore yf ye be wyllynge to bye Ley downe money, come of quyckely. Palmer. Nay by my trouth we be lyke fryers We are but beggers we be no byers Pardoner. Syr ye maye showe your ware for your mynde But I thynke ye shall no profyte fynde Pedler. Well though thys yourney acquyte no coste Yet thynke I nat my labour loste For by the fayth of my body I lyke full well thys company Up shall this packe for it is playne I came not hyther al for gayne Who may nat play one day in a weke May thynke hys thryfte is farre to seke Deuyse what pastyme ye thynke beste And make ye sure to fynde me prest Potycary. Why be ye so vnyuersall That you can do what so euer ye shall. Pedler. Syr yf ye lyste to appose me What I can do then shall ye se. Potycary. Than tell me thys be ye perfyt in drynkynge Pedler. Perfyt in drynkynge as may be wysht by thynkyng Potycary. Then after your drynkyng how fall ye to wynkyng Pedler. Syr after drynkyng whyle the shot is tynkynge Some hedes be swymmyng but myne wyl be synkynge And vpon drynkynge myne eyse wyll be pynkynge For wynkynge to drynkynge is alway lynkynge. Potycary.

Now be ye all euyn as ye begoon No man hath loste nor no man hath woon Yet in the debate wherwith ye began By waye of aduyse I wyll speke as I can I do perceyue that pylgrymage Is chyefe the thynge ye haue in vsage Wherto in effecte for loue of Chryst Ye haue or shulde haue bene entyst And who so doth with suche entent Doth well declare hys tyme well spent And so do ye in your pretence If ye procure thus indulgence Unto your neyghbours charytably For loue of them in god onely All thys may be ryght well applyed To shewell you both well occupyed For though ye walke nat bothe one waye Yet walkynge thus thys dare I saye That bothe your walkes come to one ende And so for all that do pretende By ayde of goddes grace to ensewe Any maner kynde of vertue As some great almyse for to gyue Some in wyllfull pouetie to lyue Some to make hye wayes and suche other warkes And some to mayntayne prestes and clarkes To synge and praye for soule departed These with all other vertues well marked All though they be of sondry kyndes Yet be they nat vsed with sondry myndes But as god only doth all those moue So euery man onely for his loue With loue and dred obediently Worketh in these vertues vnyformely Thus euery vertue yf we lyste to scan Is pleasaunt to god and thankfull to man And who that by grace of the holy goste To any one vertue is moued moste That man by that grace that one apply And therin serue god most plentyfully Yet nat that one so farre wyde to wreste So lykynge the same to myslyke the reste For who so wresteth hys worke is in vayne And euen in that case I perceyue you twayne Lykynge your vertue in suche wyse That eche others vertue you do dyspyse Who walketh thys way for god wolde fynde hym The farther they leke hym the farther behynde hym One kynde of vertue to dyspyse another Is lyke as the syster myght hange the brother.
