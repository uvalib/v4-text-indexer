      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Xerxes, King of Persia. Themistocles, an Athenian General. Aspasia, Daughter of Themistocles. Neocles, Son of Themistocles. Roxana, a Princess of the royal blood, in love with Xerxes. Lysimachus, Ambassador from the Greeks. Sebastes, Confidant of Xerxes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene in the city of Susa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The palace of Xerxes. Themistocles, Neocles. Them. What would'st thou do? Neoc. Permit me to chastise That haughty Persian,âseest thou not, my father, How little he attends to thy demands? What further insults must we yet endure? Them. Restrain thy ill-tim'd ardour? Thinkst thou still We tread the soil of Greece; and that thou see'st Thy father circled with the flattering crowds, That ever throng to him whom Fortune favours? All things must change; and, Neocles, the wise Submit to present evils. See in this The palace of our foe: no longer now Am I the hope, the darling pride of Athens; A poor, a wandering exile, shunn'd of all, An outcast of mankind, what have I left, Save this, (the greatest good) I still retain My constancy unshaken. Neoc. Pardon, Sir, Such constancy I scarce with temper bear. I see thee driven, excluded from those walls, Which late thy blood preserv'd; in every part To find the hatred of thy cruel country Pursue thee still, and with insidious policy, Forbid thee an asylum. Malice seems To grudge thee even a fostering spot of earth, To feed the wants of nature; yet I hear No murmurs pass thy lips: I see thy looks Unmov'd and placid. Is it possible? How canst thou thus support the unnatural stroke Of man's ingratitude? Them. Alas! my son, Thou'rt newly enter'd on the path of life, And all to thee is strange: I blame thee not; For wonder is the child of ignorance, And mother still of wisdom. Know the hatred, Thou see'st in human breasts, is mostly found The recompense of every good conferr'd; The ungrateful hate (and many such there are) The galling weight of benefits in him From whom they come; while he, from whom they come, Loves, in the man he serves, the benefits By him bestow'd; and hence, my son, proceeds My country's hate to me, my love to her. Neoc. Were only men unjust to thee, my father, I might support the thought; but even the Gods Seem mindless of thee. Them. Mindless? Neoc. Can we call This wretched state, thy virtue's due reward? Them. Of good or evil, know'st thou which to name, Reward or punishment? Neoc. What means my father? Them. By suffering, virtue is refin'd, but grows Corrupt by prosperous fortune. Limpid flows The stream midst broken rocks, but in a pool Stagnates impure; the weapon, that in war Resplendent blazes, rusts in lazy peace. Neoc. But thus to change from triumphs past to meet With trials such as these. Them. Futurity Perhaps may envy more my present trials, Than all my former triumphs. Neoc. Be it so: But say, what cause has brought thee to this place, In search of other perils? Is the hatred Of Greece so little? Would'st thou stand expos'd To Persia's fury? Dost thou not remember That Athens, when assail'd, led on by thee, Oppos'd the united force of Asia's arms, And scoff'd at Xerxes and his idle bridge? Ah! think not that such transient anger swells The heart of kings.âHere should'st thou be discover'd To whom wilt thou recur? In other parts Thy foes are many, here thy foes are all. Each, from thy counsels, has in battle lost A friend, a relative, a son or father. Ah! let us fly, my lordâin pityâ Them. Peace: Some one I see approachingâLeave me; hence And wait for me apart. Neoc. And shall I not Remain with thee, my father? Them. No: I dare not Confide in thy forbearance; and our state Requires it much. Neoc. And nowâ Them. Obey. Neoc. At least, In such a dreadful tempest, O! take heed And guard thy safety. Them. Hence and hope the best. Neoc. And can I say, O! fire belov'd! That hope will e'er be mine; Or stars, that late have cruel prov'd, Will now benignant shine? I dread the frowns of Fate severe Against thy peace combin'd; But more than all her frowns I fear Thy constancy of mind. [Exit. SCENE II. Aspasia, Sebastes. Themistocles apart. Them. [aside.] This stranger, by his looks and bearing, seems Of high concern and manners more refin'd: Of him I may enquireâbut soft, what maid With him appears; and by her vests a Greek? Asp. [to Seb.] Yet hear me. Seb. No; I cannot, fair Aspasia, Now longer here remain: the king expects me. [going. Asp. Yet one short moment: is it true the king Has made this cruel edict? Seb. 'Tis most true: Whoe'er to Xerxes brings Themistocles, Alive or dead, shall gain immense reward. [going. Asp. Unhappy father! [aside. Them. [to Seb.] Tell me, gracious lord, (If thus far may be known) can all alike Presume to approach the feet of royal Xerxes, And when and where such honour is permitted? Asp. [aside.] How shall I warn my father? Seb. [to Them. haughtily.] Hence and learn From others what thou seek'st. Them. If I perhaps Have err'd unweeting, courteous deign to instruct me; A stranger am I; and to me unknown The country's customs here. Seb. Farewell, Aspasia. [Exit, without attending to Them. Them. What senseless pride! SCENE III. Themistocles, Aspasia. Asp. [to herself.] Conduct not, mighty Gods! My father to these shores! Them. [aside.] Then let me seek Some better knowledge from this Grecian dame. [to her.] Fair virgin, if the HeavensâAlmighty Powers! What features do I see! Asp. Eternal Gods! 'Tis sure my father, or some form like his! Them. O! sayâ Asp. Themistocles! Them. Aspasia! Asp. Father! Them. My daughter! [embrace. Asp. Fly, O! flyâ Them. And dost thou live? Asp. Ah! fly, my dearest father.âO! what star In evil hour has brought you to this palace? Ah! Xerxes seeks your life, and vast rewards Are promis'd him who brings you to his sightâ Alas! delay notâsome one may discoverâ Them. Thou wilt thyself discover me, Aspasia, With this excess of fear.âSay, when to Argos I sent thee for a shelter from the dangers Of war and tumult, was not then thy ship Engulph'd in roaring waves? Asp. It was; and none, Save I alone, surviv'd the cruel wreck; By wondrous chance escap'd from stormy seas To pay with liberty my ransom'd life. Them. Say how was this? Asp. A vessel from the wavesâ (O Heaven! I freeze with terror!) from the waves A hostile vessel took me, scarce alive, And bore me prisoner to this fated land. Them. Is here thy birth disclos'd? Asp. No.âXerxes gave me (My race unknown) a present to the princess, The fair Roxana.âHow I oft invok'd A father's name! How oft I wearied Heaven With vows to see him! But I little thought To find my vows so fatally fulfill'd. Them. Compose thyself, my daughter; joy and grief Are plac'd with bounds so near to each, the passage Is but a moment's work. This day our fortune May take a different aspect; finding thee, Already do I feel my sufferings less. Asp. But how! how have you found me here? A wretch, In servile bonds! And how are you arriv'd? A fugitive proscrib'd! A lonely exile! Alas! my father, where is now the splendor That once encircled you? The pomp, the menials, The wealth, the friends?âO! Deities unjust! O! most ungrateful Athens! and does earth Support thee still? And still the thunder sleep In Jove's eternal hand? Them. Forbear, Aspasia! And learn, more wise, to keep thy grief in bounds; Know, she, who calls for vengeance on her country, Can ne'er be daughter to Themistocles; Nor will I bear thou should'st one moment harbour Such impious thoughts. Asp. When you defend her cause, Your country's guilt is doubled. Them. Hold! no more. Asp. Yet, let me beg you fly!âAh! quit this land. Them. Whence is thy dread, if there to all unknownâ Asp. To all unknown? And where! ah! where, is then Themistocles unknown? The character Of majesty impress'd upon his brow, That speaks his soul, suffices to betray him. This day the peril threatens more: from Athens At Sufa an ambassador arrives: From him and from his followers, who shall now Concealâ Them. âBut tell me, know'st thou yet his business, And what his name? Asp. I know not; but the king Will give him speedy audience.âSee already Where yonder throng the impatient populace To reach the destin'd place. Them. May each that wills it Be present at the meeting? Asp. Doubtless each. Them. Remain thou here: I haste to satisfy A wish I long have cherish'd in my breast, Thus face to face to meet my ancient foe. Asp. ForbearâUnhappy me! What would you do? You kill me with affright! O! if you love me, Forego the thoughtâBy this unconquer'd hand, On which, a trembling and a suppliant daughter, I now impress the kiss of filial duty; Even by that country, which, to you a foe, You still have reverenc'd; which you have defended, Howe'er to you ungrateful. Them. Lov'd Aspasia, Come to thy father's breast: full well in these, These fond emotions of an anxious daughter, I read thy heart; but sink not thus beneath Thy birth and virtue.âLeave to me the care To guard myselfâFarewell; and from thy father Learn to despise the frowns of niggard Fortune. Amidst the rage of adverse fate He neither fear nor tumult knows, Who, still prepar'd for every state, A heart to all undaunted shows. Those evils that attend on life Are lessons to the noble mind; As from the winds and waves at strife Their useful school the seamen find. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter Roxana. Asp. [to herself.] Alas! through all my trembling breast I feel Each fibre shake with fear! Rox. Permit me now, Aspasia, to complain; and why conceal Thy happy fortune thus? Though not a friend, I hop'd at least to find thee more sincere. Asp. [aside.] Alas! she knows it all. Themistocles Too surely is discover'd. Rox. Thou art pale! Thou answer'st not? And have I truly heard, And have I near me then my deadliest foe. Asp. Ah! princess!â Rox. Peace, ingrate, to thee I told My secret soul, to thee intrusted all, And thou, mean time, hast us'd each art to win From me the heart of Xerxes. Asp. [aside.] What I fear'd Employs not now her thoughts. Rox. Is this, Aspasia, The recompense for all my friendship shewn? Asp. Such taunts and insults ill become Roxana. Possess, without a fear, the heart of Xerxes, I never shall dispute itâno!âtoo well I know myself; think not Aspasia's hopes (Beyond her rank) aspire to mount the throne. Rox. Dissimulation all! A thousand thoughts Confirm my fears, since Xerxes first beheld thee, I find a daily change, while cold indifference Succeeds declining love. I mark his looks, Intent on thee; I hear his converse dwell Too oft on thee; and when I speak of love, He seems confus'd; then seeking an excuse To veil his luke-warm passion, lays the blame On all those cares that vex a monarch's peace. Asp. Not love, but generous pity warms his breast, For poor Aspasia's fortune. Rox. Pity oft Is but a specious name. Asp. Reflect, Roxana, How great the distance twixt myself and Xerxes. Rox. Love equals those more distant. Asp. But a stranger?â Rox. 'Tis that I fear. Sometimes the fancied value Outweighs the true; those gems are little worth Where Nature heaps them with a lavish hand, But from their scarceness oft are treasures deem'd. Asp. For pity's sake, Roxana, be not thus Ingenious to your pain? You wrong Aspasia, You wrong yourself and Xerxes: if the cares Of love can find admission in this breast, ('Midst all the sufferings of my present state) Not Xerxes is their object. In this heart Another form is grav'd; and learn, Aspasia Has not a heart that knows how love can change. Rox. And wilt thou thenâ SCENE V. Enter Sebastes. Seb. [to Rox.] If, princess, you would see The Athenian envoy, he prepares to take His audience of the king. Rox. I come, Sebastes. Asp. Hearâknow'st thou yet his name? Seb. Lysimachus. Asp. [aside.] Eternal Powers! 'tis he, my heart's dear lord! But wherefore comes he? [to Seb. Seb. As I learn, he comes To seek Themistocles. Asp. [aside.] And is HE then, Is then my lover too my father's foe? All, all the earth conspire in waging war With one unhappy exile! Rox. Go, Sebastes, Before me to the kingâfarewell Aspasia. [to Asp.] Betray me not. [Exit Sebastes. Asp. Ah! banish from your mind These jealous doubts?âAh! how can thoughts like these E'er find admittance in a noble breast? Rox. A lover I! too well I know; From jealousy what torments flow, The bane that heightens every woe, And poisons every joy. The monster with an hundred eyes, Creates the bad, the good belies, And every cruel pang supplies, To work the soul's annoy. [Exit. SCENE VI. Aspasia alone. Can this be true! And is Lysimachus, Is he too leagu'd against a wretched father? O! faithless man! already he forgets me; He thinks me dead; and thinks that to the dead 'Tis folly to be constant:âCruel stars, Midst all my sufferings this alone was wanting. What maid, alas! has ever seen Her stars more adverse shine? What tender heart by fate has been Condemn'd to pains like mine? My sighs succeed each other still: One woe another breeds; And each succeeding grief I feel, The former grief exceeds. [Exit. SCENE VII. A magnificent place for public audience. A throne on one side. View of the city at a distance. Themistocles, Neocles. Neoc. My father, whither goest thou? Still in vain I would divine thy purpose; while I mark Each look with fear, and think that every eye Is fix'd alone on thee. Behold the guards! The king is near at hand; let us depart. Them. Here, mingled with the crowd, we may remain. Neoc. Think of the danger, sir. Them. No more!âbe silent. Neoc. [aside.] I tremble for th' event, [they retire to one side. SCENE VIII. Enter Xerxes and Sebastes with a numerous attendance. Xer. Go, call before us The ambassador from Greece; he shall be heard. [a guard goes out. Sebastes, tell me, does Themistocles Still hide him from my vengeance? Have I then In vain held forth such hope of high reward? Seb. He cannot long be hid: too many snares Are laid for him to escape them. Xer. While he lives I cannot rest,âsay, has he not beheld The flight of Xerxes? Midst the unnumber'd ships, With which oppress'd th' Ãgean billows groan'd, He knows, that chac'd by him, (O! shame to think!) My life was trusted to a single bark, Poor and defenceless; that, by thirst constrain'd, I drank the scanty water, foul and putrid; And prais'd with eager lips, the savoury draught: And shall he live, who lives to boast of this? O! no!âit ne'er shall be, and in my heart The thought alone is madness. [ascends the throne. Neoc. [aside to Them.] Hear you this? Them. I do! Neoc. Then let us fly. Them. Peace, Neocles. SCENE IX. Enter Lysimachus with a train of Greeks. Lys. Great king! in whom, though in a foe to Greece, Athens not only pays the honours due To regal majesty, but, from thy virtue (Unbounded as thy empire) now expects A gift beyond the noblest. Xer. Let it not Be peace thou seek'st:âthen sit and freely speak. Neoc. [to Them.] Is that Lysimachus? [Lys. sits. Them. It is? Neoc. The friendship Of one so dear, may stand you so much in stead. Them. [to Neoc.] Be silent or depart. Lys. [to Xer.] To sweep from earth A rash disturber of the public peace One common interest claims from all that rule; Even foes should here concur: the single state That shelters one proscrib'd, must injure all; For hope of an asylum ever tempts The mind to each excess. Themistocles, (Forgive me, hapless friend!) is now the criminal That Athens seeks. Within these palace walls 'Tis thought he dwells; she could of right demand him, But rather asks him as a gift from Xerxes. Neoc. [aside.] O! cruel embassy? O! faithless friend! Them. [aside.] O! loyal citizen! Xer. We shall not now, Ambassador, explore the secret purpose That hither turn'd thy steps, nor what our trust Due to the Grecian faith; but this I know, Not all thy studied artifice of speech Can hide the boldness of a claim like this. Say, what imports to me the peace of Athens? Must I be made the power subservient here To do your bidding? Who shall thus presume To frame new leagues to bind contending foes? And com'st thou now to give me laws or counsel? The last I little trust, the first I spurn. Let not a single victory swell you thus With transient pride; for know, the fate of Greece Is little yet secur'd; and know, to Athens The way lies open still for Xerxes' arms. Lys. But what imports to you Themistocles? Xer. Learn that, when Xerxes finds him in his powerâ Lys. And dwells he not in Susa? Xer. Were it so, Of him I hold no conference with thee. Lys. My lord, your hatred of the Grecian name Blinds you too far, and if I now begin On peaceful termsâ Xer. No more: I have forbid thee To speak of peace. Lys. 'Tis true; but yetâ Xer. Enough: I know what thou would'st say, and have reveal'd To thee my thoughts at fullâthou may'st depart. Lys. I go; but since so little weighs With thee the name of friend; Think not a boast can win the praise, That must on deeds depend. Foes may be felt, though lightly priz'd, As Asia late has tried; Foes, that the more they seem'd despis'd Have dangers more defied. [Exit with train. SCENE X. Xerxes, Sebastes. Themistocles and Neocles apart. Attendants. Xer. The Greeks, Sebastes, think Themistocles Is now in PersiaâLose not then a moment To explore the truth, and ease thy anxious master. This victim can alone appease the hatred That preys upon me and consumes my peace. Neoc. [aside.] And yet my father flies not. Them. Now's the time To make the trial. [making his way through the guards. Neoc. [aside to him.] Hear me, O! my father. Them. [before the throne.] Great king. Seb. What means this frenzy? Madman, hence! Guards, take him from the presence. Them. Human prayers Offend not even the Gods. Seb. Away! Xer. Not so: He shall be heard.âWhat would'st thou, stranger? Speak. Them. I seek a shelter here from adverse Fortune, And only Jove or Xerxes can protect me. Xer. Who art thou? Say. Them. At Athens was I born. Xer. And dar'st thou then, a Greek, appear before me? Them. Yes, Xerxes, though full well I know that name Is here a crime; but now a mighty service Absolves in me that crime.âThemistocles Thou seek'st, and him I here conduct before thee. Xer. Themistocles? Can this be true? Them. With kings What lips shall utter falsehood? Xer. Such high service No recompense can answer.âWhere, O! where Is this long-sought-for object of my hatred? Them. He stands before your sight. Xer. Where is he? Them. Iâ I am Themistocles. Xer. Thou! Them. I am he. Neoc. [aside.] Where shall I hide me? [Exit. Xer. Dost thou fear so little To meet my just resentment? Dar'st thou thusâ Them. Hear me, and then determine.âSee before thee Capricious Fortune's sport.âIn me, O! king, Behold that same Themistocles who shook So late thy throne, who now resorts to thee For succour and support.âHe knows thee mighty, Nor is he yet to learn a foe's resentment Enkindled long against him; yet the hope To find in thee a guardian and protector Conducts him hither.âIn thy virtue, king, He thus confides.âBehold me in thy hand, 'Tis thine to save me, or 'tis thine to take A wish'd revenge.âIf love of noble fame Glows in thy breast, behold an ample field For virtue worthy thee: subdue thyself, And stretch thy hand to raise a prostrate foe. If hatred sway thee, pause a moment yet: What praise to conquer unresisting weakness? How useful to acquire a faithful friend. Think that thou art a king, and think that here Thou see'st an exile who confides in thee, And came a willing victim to this land; Reflect, and calmly then decide my fate. Xer. [aside.] Ye righteous Gods! was ever known a soul More firm and more unshaken! What intrepid, What unexampled virtue! Thus alone, Disarm'd, an enemy, to stand before The face of Xerxes! Thus in confidenceâ O! 'tis too muchâ[to Them.] Tell me, Themistocles, What would'st thou? With my hatred make my glory Dispute the victory?âO! now at least Thou shalt not conquer.âLet me clasp thee then Close to my breast: whate'er thou hop'st is thine; Take what thou wilt.âMy treasures shall be open'd [descends from his throne and embraces Them. To give thee aid; my kingdom shall be arm'd For thy defence; and from this happy hour Themistocles and Xerxes are the same. Them. O king! but now my hopes appear'd excess, And yet thy generous heart out-goes them all: What can I offer then? My toils, my blood, My life? For such transcendent grace bestow'd, My life, my blood, my toils were worthless all. Xer. Be thou my recompense; Themistocles Is Xerxes' friend.âYes, our contention still Shall not have end; though here I cast aside All hatred for my injuries of old, I mean with thee to wage a nobler war. Do thou consent, a nobler part Hereafter each may prove; Since glory now in either heart Has hatred chang'd to love. Thy former enmity forget; My vengeance I resign: Do thou support my regal seat, Thy safety shall be mine. [Exit attended. SCENE XI. Themistocles alone. How oft, unstable Fortune, dost thou shift Thy aspect thus; and vainly now would'st tempt me To trust thy treacherous seeming.âNo: too oft I've prov'd thy smiles and frowns: thy favour still I little heed, and hold thy wrath in scorn. Uncertain Fortune ne'er beguiles, Nor lures me with her harlot-smiles, Nor warms with hope nor chills with fears. I know that oft in vernal bowers The serpent glides amidst the flowers; I know that oft in midnight hours We praise a star, when none appears. [Exit. SCENE XII. Aspasia alone. Where am I? Who will now, ah! hapless maid, Shew me my father? Here in vain I seek him, Yet self-discover'd here but now he stood Before the kingâso Neocles declar'd: He could not be deceiv'd. SCENE XIII. Enter Roxana. [Asp.] Ah! princess, hear, In pity hear me, and protect my father From angry Xerxes' vengeance. Rox. Say'st thou?âFather? Asp. O! yesâbehold in me, immortal powers! The wretched daughter of Themistocles. Rox. In thee? Can this be possible? Asp. No more It aught avails to keep my birth conceal'd. Rox. [aside.] Alas! my rival now has stronger charms. Asp. Go, generous princess, plead, implore his pardon. Rox. Pardon for him? Then sure thou know'st not all. Asp. I know my father here to angry Xerxes Disclos'd himself: my brother, who in vain Oppos'd his purpose, fled in terror hence. He saw me since, and from his trembling lips I heard the fatal truth. Rox. Now learn the rest: Know thenâ SCENE XIV. Enter Sebastes. Seb. Aspasia, hasten; Xerxes now Requires your presence; for Themistocles Has own'd you for his daughter: never yet The king appear'd to hear more grateful tidings. Rox. [aside.] Death to my hopes! Asp. [aside.] O Heaven!âIs then his hatred Rooted so deep in Xerxes? Seb. Hatred? No: Themistocles is now his only joy. Asp. What do I hear, Sebastes! 'Twas but now He sought his death. Seb. And now, with all the warmth A friend can feel, he clasps him to his breast; Calls him his life; directs all eyes to him, And only speaks of his Themistocles. Asp. Farewell RoxanaâO! the heart-felt rapture! Th' excess of joy which now I find Becomes a pleasing pain; A joy like this my suffering mind Might long have hop'd in vain. With Fortune's smiles my soul appears So rapt in bliss extreme; I tremble still with anxious fears Lest all should prove a dream. [Exit. SCENE XV. Roxana, Sebastes. Seb. [aside.] Take courage, heart, and hope, since jealousy Has touch'd Roxana's breast. Rox. What means, Sebastes, The impatience shewn by Xerxes now to seek The converse of Aspasia? Seb. What suspicion His thoughts suggest, Sebastes fears to speak. Rox. And wherefore? Freely speak. Seb. To me it seems That Xerxes loves her: when he heard her birth, A sudden pleasure brighten'd in his features, And told the secret workings of his heart. Rox. O! noâit cannot beâ'tis but a dream Thy fancy shapes. Seb. Heaven grant it prove no other! But yet 'tis ever well to fear the worst. Rox. Ye powers! Should this be true what course befits Roxana then? Seb. What course? To seek revenge. What may not beauty such as yours achieve? 'Tis joy to punish a perfidious lover. Rox. Revenge at first may yield a short relief, But ne'er can recompense our hopes destroy'd. Amidst a thousand hearts to choose A heart in whom our hopes repose; Yet there betray'd, our peace to lose, Is sure the worst of human woes. You best can tell, whose bosoms know The pangs from faithless lovers found: Of all afflictions felt below, Misfortune gives no deeper wound. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Sebastes alone. Heaven smiles upon me, since Aspasia now In Xerxes finds a lover, and resentment Has warm'd Roxana's breast.âThe care be mine To cherish love in Xerxes, and in her To increase the jealous fury.âShould she once Be rous'd to wish revenge, I then may risk A deed of high import.âMy numerous friends With her's united soon might make Sebastes Even fear'd by Xerxes.âTo the Persian throne I may perhapsâWho knows?â'Tis true I own That hope is ever daring; but we find That fortune and that boldness oft unite. Though rash was he who durst explore The threatening waves unplough'd before, And sought to find a distant shore In regions long unknown: Yet had the sailor ne'er defied With venturous oar the roaring tide, What treasures still, in lands untried, Had ne'er been made our own. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A magnificent apartment destined for Themistocles. Vases with gold and jewels. Themistocles alone. Behold thy fortune chang'd! Behold thy station, How different now, Themistocles! But late Oppress'd with every want; thou soughtst in vain The shelter of a cottage: now possess'd Of this rich dwelling, blazing round with pomp Of wealth and splendor: Thou behold'st in heaps Unbounded treasures: to thy will subjected, A kingdom and a king. Upon the stage Of this vain world, who knows what part may next Themistocles be thine: too well I see That human life, at best, is but a tale; And mine as yet unfinish'd. SCENE II. Enter Neocles. Neoc. Once again Father belov'd, on innocence and virtue The stars propitious shine: from every danger We now are freed. When Athens shall receive These wondrous tidings, how will terror shake Her citizens ungrateful! Now begins Our fortune's happy course: I see it all. And now, with thee, I seem to reap my part Of wealth and honours, share with thee the praise Of palms and triumphs; pass Alcides' bounds, And conquer kings and give to kingdoms laws. Them. Hold, Neocles; and trust not yet too far Our present state. Thy ardour now exceeds, As late thy fear? When adverse winds prevail'd, Thou trembledst near the port; and now they shew A moment's favouring change, at once, my son, Thou open'st all thy canvas to the breeze, Ill tim'd in both. Thy confidence of soul Is now a fault, but then had been a virtue: And that distrust, which once so far depress'd thee, Was then a fault, but would be virtue now. Neoc. And what have we to fear? Them. In what to trust? These treasures? These a moment has bestow'd, A moment may resume them. In the friends Thou saw'st me late acquire? These are not mine, They come with Fortune, and with her depart. Neoc. But royal Xerxes' favour will suffice To make our state secure. Them. And Xerxes' anger, Suffice to be our ruin. Neoc. No: the king Is far too wise and just. Them. A king so great, Beholds not all himself, too oft deceiv'd When wicked men besiege the royal ear; And wicked men abound in every clime. Neoc. Thy virtue still must make thee rise above The calumny of courts. Them. O! no, where each Attempts o'er all to make his merits shine, The virtue, most admir'd, is least secure. Neoc. What then remains?â Them. DepartâThe king approaches. Neoc. In all thy words what magic seems conceal'd! But now I thought us bless'd, and now I fear A thousand perils. In a few short moments, All, all to me assumes a different form. Before the pleas'd spectator's eyes Thus various forms successive rise, Which oft the mimic stage supplies, With every art bestow'd. A prison, dark as dreary night, Becomes a palace fair and light; And groves of verdure cheer the sight, Where late the billows flow'd. [Exit. SCENE III. Enter Xerxes. Xer. Themistocles. Them. Great king. Xer. I still am bound To thee in grateful ties, and owe thee much. I promis'd recompense to him who brought Themistocles to Persia. I have now My utmost wish, and with impatience come To make my promise good. Them. So many gifts Already lavish'dâshall not these suffice? Xer. No, every recompense too little seems For such a friend obtain'd, as swells my heart With generous pride. Them. And meansâ Xer. I mean to amend The injuries of Fortune, and to raise thee In her despite. Miuntes, Lampsacus, The city, wash'd by fair Meander's stream, Are from this instant thine: hereafter Xerxes Will give more shining proofs to mark the love, With which he justly honours thy deserts. Them. O! sir, be moderate; use not thus your triumph, Nor call my blushes forth: what have I done That thus from you may claimâ Xer. What hast thou done? And dost thou think it little to confide In Xerxes' generous faith? To intrust with him A life like thine? To open him a field, Will make his name immortal? To restore To Persia's kingdom in Themistocles, In him alone, whate'er before was lost. Them. Reflect, from me, what ruin, bloodâ Xer. The glory To honour thus the virtue of my foe, Compensates all: the first was Fortune's work, And Fortune's blameâthis glory is my own. Them. O! generous sentiments! that well befit The substitute of Jove. Oh! happy land, To such a king subjected. Xer. Hear me further. I mean to follow now the grateful contest Of mutual friendship. To my power thy life Thou hast intrusted; to thy valour I Intrust my power. Thou shalt be sovereign leader Of Persia's armies: come, and take before The assembled troops, the ensign of command, Thou first shalt hence to punish the presumption Of restless Egypt. Greater deeds we then May hope to achieve: with thee, Themistocles, I trust to triumph o'er the world in arms. Them. And will my generous king so farâ Xer. Away, Prepare for other triumphs. Let thy deeds Speak what thou mean'st to say. Them. Benignant Powers! Preserve for me a prince so like yourselves, O! let me still remember all his goodness, For Xerxes triumph or for Xerxes die. I seem to hear, with loud alarms, The trumpet's wakening breath, That calls me forth for thee in arms To encounter fields of death. Undaunted let me meet my fate, And view, with fearless eye, My tomb prepar'd, but ne'er ingrate To thee, my king, I'll die. [Exit. SCENE IV. Xerxes alone. 'Tis ever true: a regal diadem Is heavy to support, and with it brings A thousand troubles; but the power it gives To recompense the good, set virtue free From the blind empire of capricious Chance; To make the worthy happy; is a privilege Atones for all, and opens to the soul The purest joys of frail humanity; And (if a mortal boast may thus presume) Can make a monarch equal to a God. Such have I prov'd it, since the day in which I gain'd Themistocles? It now imports me To make this gain secure. I mean to raise Aspasia to the throne: her birth, her virtue, Her beauty well deserve it. In my empire Themistocles will then assert the rights Of all his future offspring, whilst the ties Of blood shall make our mutual love increase. Yet would I first consult Aspasia's heart: Already, at my will, Sebastes goes To sound her secret purpose. But as yet, I see him not returnâperchance he's here, O! Heavens!âIt is Roxana!âlet me now Avoid her presence, [going. SCENE V. Enter Roxana. Rox. Whither goes my lord? Do you then fly me! Xer. No! but other cares Of high concernment call me now away. Rox. And yet amongst those cares Roxana once Has borne a part. Xer. But now they claim me wholly. Rox. 'Tis true, and well I understand thee, Xerxes. I see how far Themistocles must now Employ thy thoughts; and just it seems, a guest So noble should engross the heart of Xerxes. Thy mind (nor strange I deem it) is perplex'd Between the father's merits andâ Xer. No moreâ Princess, farewell. [going. Rox. Yet, hear me, cruel man! Xer. [aside] She must be undeceiv'd, [to her]âattend Roxana; 'Tis time I should to thee disclose my thoughts. Know thenâ SCENE VI. Enter Sebastes. Seb. My lord, the Ambassador from Greece Once more demands an audience. Xer. Wherefore, say? Then is he not departed? Seb. No, he learns That here Themistocles resides in Susa, And means to make large offers to obtain him. Xer. O! 'tis too much; he trifles with my patience: I will not hear himâcharge him to depart, Nor dare to disobey me. [Seb. going. Rox. [aside.] This resentment, Alas! proceeds from love. Xer. Yet hear, Sebastes; I've better thoughtâGo, bring him to our presence, I'll punish his presumption. [Exit Seb. Rox. Speak at length Your secret purpose. Xer. 'Tis no longer time. [going. Rox. You promise, Xerxes, first to tell me all, Then, cruel man! you answer not, but leave me. Xer. Alas! when speechless I depart, Could'st thou, Roxana, read my heart, My thoughts would then unfolded lie. For oft we seem but to conceal Those truths which looks too well reveal, When silence only makes reply. [Exit. Rox. In vain, alas! I would deceive myself. Aspasia triumphsâbut behold she comes, The haughty fair-one. SCENE VII. Enter Aspasia. [Rox.] [looking at Asp. with attention.] Where's the mighty charm That thus in her my Xerxes so adores? Asp. At length, Roxana, all your doubts are ended. Rox. [aside, looking at her.] I cannot find a cause for chains so binding. Asp. What dost thou?âWherefore gaze in silence on me? Rox. I seek the wonders of that face, Those powerful eyes, and every grace, That risk a king's repose. A lover whom such charms assail, Must find excuse if e'er he fail In faith of former vows. [Exit. Asp. What harsh reproaches! Tyrant Jealousy, How dost thou torture hearts! I too, O Heaven! Have prov'd no less for my Lysimachus. SCENE VIII. Enter Lysimachus. Lys. [entering.] O! let me for a moment but behold her, And thenâ[seeing her.] But sure I dream!âIt is my love! Asp. [to herself, not seeing him.] He surely knows I live; for public fame Must widely spread the chanceâAlas! he glows With other flames than mineâungrateful man! And yet I cannot shake him from my thoughts; But henceâit shall be soâthese ties dissolv'dâ [going. Lys. Hear me, my life! Asp. [turning.] Who calls me thus his life? [seeing him.] O Heavens! Lys. Thy own, thy true Lysimachus; Yes, fair Aspasia, once again my fate Has brought me to my lov'd-one's sight. Asp. Aspasia? I am no longer sheâAspasia's dead. Lys. So fame, I know, declar'd; but well I know The tale was false; I know how Heaven preserv'd thee. Asp. Then add to this, what yet thou hast not learn'd, And further knowâfor thee I live no more. Lys. Ah! wherefore thus transfix my bleeding heart? Asp. So true a lover and so firm a friend Must merit sure from me a tender greeting. And hast thou dar'd, ingrate! my father's foe, To meet Aspasia now and speak of love? Lys. Thy father's foe? Alas! thou little know'st The conflict that I feel.âA sacred duty Compels me to obey my country's mandates; While every moment, in my tortur'd breast, The lover with the citizen contends. Asp. Thou must relinquish one. Lys. Ah! one I cannot, And one I ought not.âEvery hour I strive, With agonizing pangs, against my peace, And seek to gain what, gain'd, must make me wretched. Asp. The Heavens be prais'd! thou yet hast nothing gain'd. Lys. Alas! Aspasia, I have gain'd too much. Forgive me, O! ye guardian Gods of Athens! If to her griefs I pay this tender sigh. Asp. I trembleâspeakâsay, what hast thou obtain'd? Lys. The king gives up Themistocles to Greece. Asp. Wretched Aspasia! Lys. Even this very hour He plights his word to send him hence. Asp. O Heavens! [aside.] Ah! Xerxes thus will punish my refusal. [to Lys.] Lysimachus, have pity! Thou alone Canst save my father. Lys. O! what power is mine? Perhaps already may the king expect me, Where now the people and the troops are met. Before them all he means to render up The victim to my hands.âO! think what power Can rest with me. Asp. All, if thou wilt, is thine: Consent that by a secret flightâ Lys. Aspasia, What would'st thou ask? Asp. I from a lover ask A certain proof of love: thou canst not sure Reject my prayer. Lys. Alas! before I lov'd My duty was prescrib'd by other laws, A citizen of Athens. Asp. Does the name Of citizen compel thee to pursue A guiltless exile? Lys. O! I seek it not: I but fulfil my duty. Asp. Be it so: We have our several dutiesâthis is mine. Farewell for ever! [going. Lys. Whither, whither goest thou? Asp. I go to Xerxes' arms. Lys. What says Aspasia? Asp. Yes, Xerxes loves me, and to assist a father All nature pleads within me.âEre I lov'd My duty was prescrib'd by other laws, The daughter of Themistocles. Lys. Yet hear me. Give not the world, Aspasia, this example Of broken faith. Asp. I follow where thou lead'st, And but fulfil my duty. Lys. Does the struggle So little cost thee? Asp. Little cost? Then learn To thy confusion, 'tis to punish me That Xerxes gives my father: but even now He sent to offer me his hand and throne; And she, to whom it little costs to leave thee, Has, for thy sake, refus'd the Persian throne. Lys. What say'st thou, O! my love? Asp. Nor is this all. Hear, cruel man! thou know'st I've many a cause, And yet I cannot hate thee: now reduc'd To this extreme, to part from thee for ever, I feel my heart divided from my breast. I should conceal my weaknessâbut in vain, In vain I striveâBehold, ungrateful man! In spite of all, my tears will find a way. Lys. Ah! weep not thusâI yieldâWhat have I said? Farewell, my life, farewell! Asp. And whither goest thou? Lys. I fly from trials which my virtue fears. Asp. If any spark of pity yet remainâ Lys. No moreâI dare not trust my wavering duty. What magic power the fair attends, Who lost in grief appears; What then the sternest heart defends From lovely eyes in tears? I fly, my love, an exile hence; If still with thee I stay, No more my virtue makes defence, Nor Athens I obey. [Exit. SCENE IX. Aspasia alone. Then all my hope that now remains, is this, To give my hand to Xerxes.âO! Aspasia, What grief, ye Powers! what cruel fate is thine. The heart that gentle love retains, Must mourn when doom'd with other chains Of tyrant bondage to comply. Life is not life in such a state, Compell'd to yield to vows we hate. And pity, where we love, deny. [Exit. SCENE X. A magnificent pavilion, open on all sides; a throne on the right hand adorned with military ensigns. View of a vast plain, with the Persian army drawn up. Xerxes, Sebastes. A train of Satraps, Guards and People. Xer. Sebastes, is it true? Does then Aspasia Reject my profferr'd nuptials? Seb. Every beauty Is coy when first we woo: perhaps in secret Aspasia may have felt an equal passion, But blushes to confess; and only waits A father's sanction to declare her love. Xer. That sanction soonâ Seb. Behold the illustrious exile; And with him comes the ambassador of Athens. Xer. Sebastes, see that now to me be brought The ensign of command. [Xerxes ascends the throne, Seb. stands next him, and one of the Satraps brings the staff of military command, with which he stands near the throne. SCENE XI. Enter Themistocles with Lysimachus.âLysimachus, as he advances, speaks to Themistocles, not heard by Xerxes. Lys. Alas! my friend, To what a cruel task has Heaven assign'd me! How must I blushâ Them. And wherefore should'st thou blush? Themistocles can judge between the friend, And citizen of Athens: well he knows Our country is the Deity, to which Must all be sacrific'd.âWere I as you, Themistocles had been Lysimachus. Xer. Draw near. Themistocles: See here assembled The bravest, chosen troops of Persia's host: To these selected warriors only wants A general worthy them: that charge be thine. Take this, and with this ensign I elect thee Their chief and leader.âIn my stead, dispense Rewards and punishments.âGo, fight and conquer: To thee I trust my fame and Persia's fate. Lys. [aside.] The king has then deceiv'd me, or Aspasia Has found the means to appease him. Them. [receiving the staff.] Mighty king! Confiding in your goodness I accept The weight of this high charge, and here I swear Eternal faith.âThe Gods decree that Fortune For thee may ever combat on my side! Or should the stars forebode disastrous chance, Themistocles be doom'd, and he alone, To meet their anger: let the squadrons conquer, And let him perish!âSo may Xerxes see, Return'd with laurel, not with cypress wreaths, Amidst his conquering bands their leader slain. Lys. Is this the way, O! Xerxes, that to Athens You give Themistocles? Xer. I only swore To send him back to Greece.âThen hear if now I shall fulfil my promiseâ[to Them.] Valiant chief! At length I mean to punish this presumption. Another may conduct our arms in Egypt: Be thou my scourge in Greece.âGo, burn, destroy, Spread desolation; heap our galling chains On Sparta, Corinth, Argos, Thebes and Athens. Them. [aside.] Now am I lost! Lys. And was I call'dâ Xer. Go, bear These glorious tidings to thy countrymen; Say how their exile will revisit Greece, And what companions on his steps attend. Lys. [aside.] O! my unhappy country! false Aspasia! [Exit with Greeks. SCENE XII. Xerxes, Themistocles, Sebastes. Them. [aside.] Themistocles a traitor! Xer. What employs Our general's thoughts? Them. Ah! change, my king, your purpose; For many nations yet are unsubdued. Xer. If first I trample not on hostile Greece, The conquer'd world can give me little pride. Them. Reflect againâ Xer. Already 'tis determin'd; And he who dares oppose this enterprise Encounters my resentment. Them. Then elect Some other leader. Xer. Wherefore? Them. At the feet Of Xerxes I lay down this honour'd ensign Of Persia's high command. [lays down the staff at the foot of the throne. Xer. What can this mean? Them. And would'st thou have Themistocles a rebel To o'erturn his native walls?âMisfortune never Can change me thus. Seb. [aside.] What unexampled daring! Xer. Not Athens now, this palace is thy country: The first proscribes thee and pursues thy life, The last receives, defends and gives thee being. Them. Whoe'er defends me, I was born at Athens, And 'tis by nature's instinct that we cherish Our dear paternal seats.âIn forest glooms The savage beasts will love their native caves. Xer. [aside.] I burn with rageâ[to him.] Then Athens still remains The mistress of thy heart? But what in her Can still Themistocles so highly prize? Them. All, sovereign lord! the ashes of our fathers, The sacred laws, the tutelary Gods, The language, manners, my repeated toils For her endur'd; the honours heap'd upon me; The very air, the trees, the soil and walls. Xer. Ingrate! and dost thou thus before my face [descends from his throne. Thus proudly boast a love so hateful to me? Them. I still amâXerxesâ Xer. Thou art still my foe: In vain, with benefits conferr'd, I stroveâ Them. These in my heart for ever fix'd remain In characters indelible.âLet Xerxes Point out his other foes: for him my blood Shall freely flow; but if he still would hope To employ my courage for my country's ruin, With rebel arms, then Xerxes is deceiv'd: For her I've ever liv'd, for her will die. Xer. No moreâreflectâresolveâthou canst not live The guard of Athens and the friend of Xerxes. âChoose as thou wilt. Them. Thou know'st my choice. Xer. Remember: This moment seals thy fate. Them. Too well I know it. Xer. Thou anger'st him whose power can make thee wretched. Them. But not a rebel. Xer. 'Tis to me, thy life By me preserv'd, is due. Them. But not my honour. Xer. Greece hates Themistocles. Them. But Greece I love. Xer. [aside.] Ye Gods! what insolence!â[to him.] Is Xerxes thus By thee rewarded? Them. I was born at Athens. Xer. [aside.] I can no longer holdâGuards! from our presence Remove the ingrate for future punishment: We yet may see that dauntless courage tremble. Them. Where guilt is not, there never harbours fear. These placid features, midst my chains, Shall still unmov'd appear; 'Tis guilt alone, not threaten'd pains, Can mark this cheek with fear. If truth the name of guilt can wear, I justly yield my breath; While, suffering for a crime so fair, I triumph in my death. [Exit guarded. SCENE XIII. Enter Roxana. Rox. I scarcely, Xerxes, can believeâ Xer. Ah! princess, Whoe'er could have believ'd it? In my palace, Before the world Themistocles insults me. He worships Athens still; he boasts for her His faith unshaken; for her sake, with scorn Foregoes the friendship and the gifts of Xerxes. Rox. [aside.] My hopes reviveâ[to Xer.] Who knows? Perhaps the daughter May change his will. Xer. The daughter and the father Alike to me are foes.âYes, every Greek, By natural instinct, bears to Xerxes hatred: I will on both have vengeance. Rox. [aside.] Happy change! [to Xer.] All have not, sir, the heart of your Roxana. Xer. I know it well, and blush at what is past. Rox. And yet I fear that if again Aspasia Should now returnâ Xer. Aspasia? O! she dares not So far presume. SCENE XIV. Enter Aspasia. Asp. Have pity, gracious lord! Rox. [to Xer.] See if she dares so farâbut listen not To her seducing words. Xer. Yes, let us hear What she would urge. Asp. O! Xerxes, save my father; Give him an offering to your noble nature, And give him to my tears. Xer. [aside.] Enchanting sorrow! Rox. [aside.] I fear the trial now. Xer. And art thou come To implore my pardon? Thou, who seem'st o'er all, To scorn my bounty. Asp. No! you are deceiv'd. Shame prompted my refusal. Should you now Restore my father, modesty would find A specious veil to hide a maiden's blushes,â My heart might then be yours. Rox. [aside.] O! patience, Heaven! Xer. And shall I then forgive the ingrate, who loves My deadliest foe? Asp. O! no!â'tis less I ask! Suspend your angerâI perhaps may bend His will to yours.âCan you deny me this? Oh! I was born unhappy! Ne'er till now The wretched went from Xerxes unreliev'd: I am the first to prove his crueltyâ Alas! it cannot be,âI'll ne'er believe it, You do but feign a rigour not your own, And, while you pity, only seem severe. O! mighty king! indulge your generous heart, Yield to its feelings, to Aspasia's hopes, Or see her with Themistocles expire. Xer. Aspasia, riseâ[aside.] What power enchants me thus! Rox. [aside.] Again am I deluded. Xer. Let thy father Obey my will, I pardon all the past. Say, that on him his fate depends, Whate'er his choice may guide, Say that my arm the bolt suspends, But lays not yet aside. Then let him merit to obtain The pardon I bestow; For anger stay'd, when rais'd again, Will give the weightier blow. [Exit. SCENE XV. Enter Roxana, Aspasia, Sebastes. Rox. [aside.] I feel my spirits sink. Asp. Forgive, Roxana, The duty that compelsâ Rox. Go, haughty maid, Avoid Roxana's presence. Thou hast conquer'd: I see, I own it allâI yield him to thee. What would'st thou further? Seek'st thou greater triumph? This insult is too much!âI'll bear no more. Asp. Thine anger patient I sustain, I pity thy distress; Thou canst not see my inward pain, What griefs my heart oppress. Ah! who shall tell, since none can view The thoughts I only know, If envy for my bliss is due, Or pity for my woe. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Roxana, Sebastes. Seb. [aside.] This anger may avail me. Rox. Oh! Sebastes, Could I revenge myself for Xerxes' falsehoodâ Seb. The means are ready. If my faithful friends But join with yours, your vengeance is secur'd, And Persia's sceptre is at our disposal. Rox. What friends hast thou to offer me. Seb. The bands Of numerous malecontents, in Egypt rais'd, On me depend: Orontes is their leader, By me elected, and at my command: Peruse this paper late from him receiv'd. [gives a paper. Rox. Go, friend; await me now in my apartment, I'll join thee soon. 'Twere dangerous here with thee To hold such converse. Seb. May I then presume To hopeâ Rox. Away.âFear not, I will be grateful: I owe thee much and well I know thou lov'st me. Seb. [aside.] At length my hopes have found a happy hour. [Exit. SCENE XVII. Roxana , alone. And canst thou, O! Roxana, then resolve To crush the man whom late thy soul ador'd? Yes, let him fallâthe ingrate contemns my love, And he shall pay the forfeit to my wrongs: O! I could see him to a thousand foes Expos'd, and see him with a tearless eye; Would at his latest hourâO! Heaven, I boast Of anger, while my trembling heart belies me. The bosom now with anger burns To punish an ingrate: But soon to love our anger turns, And softens at his fate. We seek revenge on him who pain'd The fond believing breast; But when we find it near attain'd, The vengeance we detest. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. An apartment where Themistocles is confined. Themistocles alone. O! Athens! O! my country! sacred name To me so fatal. Sweet till now it seem'd For thee to bend my cares, for thee to shed My dearest blood. With patience I endur'd Thy harsh decrees: amidst my woes resign'd, I rov'd from shore to shore; but to preserve My faith to thee, I find myself compell'd To appear ingrate; and to a king so generous, Who, powerful and incens'd, forgets the claims Of past resentment; clasps me to his breast; Heaps honours on me; and to me intrusts His dignity and empire. Pardon, Athens, This is too much. Thou still shalt be the God Of all my thoughts, as thou hast ever been; But now I feel, and first begin to feel How dear my duty costs me. SCENE II. Enter Sebastes. Seb. Xerxes sends By me, Themistocles, and wills to know At once thy final choice: he trusts to find thee Repentant of thine error: this he hopes; And says, he never can so far believe Themistocles ungrateful. Them. Never, never Shall such reproach be mine: this witness, Heaven! That sees my heart,âO! could my king as well There read Themistocles.âConduct me, friend, Conduct me to him. Seb. 'Tis not now permitted. First on the sacred altar come prepar'd To swear eternal enmity to Greece, Or hope no more to view the face of Xerxes. Them. And must I, at no other price, obtain To see my benefactor? Seb. No.âswear this, And thou art Xerxes' friend; but this refus'd, I tremble for thy fate: in this thou know'st The king implacable. Them. [aside.] Then must I prove A rebel to my country, or be stain'd With base ingratitude? Before the world Might I not plead my love, my faith to Xerxes, Or dying own his benefits conferr'd? [thoughtful. Seb. Resolve. Them. [aside.] It shall be soâlet us escape This cruel labyrinth, and be the means Worthy Themistocles. [to Seb.] Go now, prepare The altar, beverage and the sacred vase, Whate'er the oath requiresâmy choice is made: I follow thee. Seb. With speed I bear to Xerxes The gladsome tidings. Them. Hear me.âSay, is yet Lysimachus departed? Seb. From the port His anchors now are loos'd. Them. O! haste, detain him; Let him be present at the solemn rite: Sebastes, bear my wishes to the king. Seb. It shall be so. Thou now may'st rule at will The heart of Xerxes. [Exit. SCENE III. Themistocles alone. Be my life's last hour With splendor clos'd; and, like a dying torch, Quench'd in a blaze.âHo! guards, call hither to me Neocles and Aspasia.âLet me thinkâ What is this death? Is it a good? We then Should haste to welcome it.âIs it an evil? We then should shorten our expectance of it: The greater evil.âHe deserves not life Who rates his fame beneath it.âLife is still The privilege of every mortal born, But fame th' exclusive privilege, the treasure Of noble minds.âThe vile may fear his death, Who, lost to others, to himself unknown, Died at his birth, and with him carries all Unnotic'd to the tomb.âHe dauntless yields His latest breath, who can, without a blush, View how he liv'd, and viewing, calmly die. SCENE IV. Enter Neocles and Aspasia. Neoc. My dearest father. Asp. O! my much-lov'd lord. Neoc. Is it then true, that you will choose a life Of gratitude to Xerxes? Asp. Is it true That you at length have yielded to compassion For us and for yourself? Them. Be silent both, And calmly hear meâKnow ye well the obedience A father's will requires? Neoc. That law is sacred. Asp. A tie that nothing can dissolve. Them. 'Tis well. I charge you to conceal what I impart Till all I have determin'd with myself Shall be mature. Neoc. His promise Neocles Most firmly plights. Asp. To this Aspasia swears. Them. Sit then; and give me each a proof of courage In listening to my words. [sits. Neoc. [aside.] I freeze with terror! [sits. Asp. [aside.] Alas! I tremble. [sits. Them. Hear me, O! my children, 'Tis the last time we e'er shall speak together: Till now I've liv'd with glory; if my life Be still prolong'd, I lose perhaps the fruit Of every toilâThemistocles must die. Asp. What says my father? Neoc. O! what thoughts are these? Them. The noble Xerxes is my liberal patron, My country, Greece: to him my gratitude, To her I owe my truth.âEach duty now Opposes each: if either I infringe, Rebellion or ingratitude must stain Your father's name: by death I may avoid The dread alternative.âWith me I carry A potent friendly poisonâ Asp. O! my father, Have you not given but now your word to Xerxes To meet him at the altar? Them. In his presence The deed must be completed. Neoc. But Sebastes Affirm'd, that at the altar you would take A solemn oathâ Them. I know he so believes: This suits my purpose well; with such a hope Xerxes prepares to hear me.âI would wish All Persia to behold the glorious deed; Would call, to every thought my breast conceals, To all I feel for Athens and for Xerxes, As judge and witness, a recording world. Neoc. [aside.] O! wretched, wretched we! Asp. Undone Aspasia! [they weep. Them. Ah! children, whence this weakness? Hide from me Such unavailing grief, nor make me blush That I'm your father.âYou indeed might weep If e'er Themistocles had fear'd to die. Asp. When you are dead, ah! whither shall we fly? Neoc. What then remains for us? Them. For you remain The love of virtue, the desire of glory, The guardian care of Heaven and my example. Asp. Alas! my father. Them. Hear me: I must leave you, Alone and orphans, in a foreign land, Amidst your foes, without the due support That nature claims; and little yet experienc'd In all the fickle turns of human life. And hence (I well foresee) you both must suffer, And suffer much; but ever bear in mind You are the children of Themistocles: Let this suffice; and may your deeds proclaim you In every trial worthy of the name. Let the first objects of your thought be honour, Your country, and that duty which the Gods Have call'd you to fulfil; and know the mind In every state can make itself illustrious, And still employ the choicest gifts of Heaven, To grace no less the cottage than the throne. Sink not beneath the weight of adverse fortune: Evils too great to bear will never last, And evils we can bear, may be subdued. Let virtue urge you still to deeds of praise, And not the recompense.âAbhor the guilt, And not the punishment; and if your fate Should e'er impel you to an act unworthy, One way remainsâand learn that way from me. [rises. Neoc. O! do not leave us yet. [rises. Asp. My dearest father! And shall I never, never see you more? Them. Here break we offânor vainly thus prolong These last adieus.âIt is too much, my children, Too much for feeble natureâour affections Too far will weakenâIâI am a father, And O! I feelâfarewell my dearest children! [embrace. Ah! cease these unavailing tears, Nor think that now to death I go: I go to triumph o'er the stars, And every ill that mortals know. I go to crown my last of days With added wreaths of virtuous spoils; I go to ensure, with endless praise, The fruit of all my former toils. [Exit. SCENE V. Aspasia, Neocles. Asp. O! Neocles. Neoc. Aspasia. Asp. O! my brother! Neoc. What dreadful stroke is this! Asp. O! most unhappy! And whither shall we go? Neoc. To prove us worthy Of such a father, [firmly.] Let us hence, my sister, And see, intrepid see, Themistocles Thus triumph o'er himself.âOur noble bearing Will make his death more pleasing. Asp. Let us go: âAlas! I cannotâstill my trembling feetâ [sits. Neoc. And will you thus disgrace the birth you boast? Asp. And can your constancy support the sight? Neoc. What I may want his virtue shall supply. While from his features, pale in death, The beams of virtue shine, The courage in his latest breath Shall give new force to mine. A father calls me hence to show A son's undaunted breast; To obey a father's call I go, And leave to Fate the rest. [Exit. SCENE VI. Aspasia alone. Then shall my brother bear a firmer mind Than I, alas! can boast?âDoes not the blood His father gave him warm Aspasia's veins? Like his my birth was from Themistocles. Yes, we will pay him every pious duty: And let him, when he breathes his last, repose On this sad breast, while on his clay-cold hand An orphan daughter prints the farewell kiss, And closes with her hand his dying eyes. âO Heaven! what cruel image!âAh! what chillness Through every fibre creepsâI fain would go, And yet I still remainâI freeze with horror, And glow with fear and shame: at once I'm urg'd, At once repuls'dâI lose the time in tears, Resolve on nothing, while my father's lost. While honour bids me hence remove My trembling feet detain me here; And still distressful change I prove, By courage rais'd, depress'd by fear. Ye Gods! from this unhappy breast Bid wearied life at length depart: Enough, alas! by woes depress'd, That long have rent my bleeding heart. [Exit. SCENE VII. Xerxes alone. Where is my general? Where Themistocles? Let him no longer keep from his embrace A king that loves him. SCENE VIII. Enter Roxana with a paper. Rox. Xerxes, I am come In search of thee. Xer. [aside.] Unfortunate encounter! Rox. Hear me; and let this hearing be the last. Xer. Full well I know, Roxana, that your anger Is kindled now against me: well I know You threaten me with vengeance. Rox. 'Tis most true, I would revengeâI am indeed the offended: Then learn my vengeance. Xerxes, know thy life And sceptre are in danger. In this paper Read all the black design: prevent the treason, Preserve thyselfâfarewell. [going. Xer. Yet hear me, princess: At least permit me for this generous giftâ Rox. Let this sufficeâRoxana is reveng'd. What sweet revenge the generous mind Will ever prove, a wrong design'd With friendship to repay? This shall Roxana's heart restore To every joy it knew before, And all her pangs allay. [Exit. SCENE IX. Xerxes alone. This paper to Sebastes is consign'd, And written by Orontes.âLet us nowâ [reads. O Heaven! what impious treachery! Sebastes Is then the secret author of the tumults In Egypt rais'd; while ever at my side, With well-dissembled zealâBehold him here; And dares the traitor now appear before me? SCENE X. Enter Sebastes. Seb. At length I come, O Xerxes, to request A recompense for all my truth and toils. Xer. So great indeed, Sebastes, are thy merits Thou well may'st hope for every thing from Xerxes. What would'st thou? Speak. Seb. Themistocles departs To conquer Athens: but for Egypt's bands No chief as yet is nam'd: of these I ask From Xerxes the command. Xer. Would'st thou no more? Seb. Sebastes only seeks to give to Xerxes Proofs of his zeal. Xer. Already have I many. This task is worthy thee: but know'st thou well The soil of Egypt? Seb. All her mountains, rivers, Her forests, ways, defiles; I could describe Her very rocks. Xer. All this will not suffice: It much imports to know the names of those By whom the tumults have been rais'd. Seb. Orontes, And he alone. Xer. I deem'd that other chiefs With him were join'd: this paper bears the names; See if to thee they're known. [gives the paper. Seb. And whence, my lord, Receiv'd you this?âO Heaven! what do I see! Xer. How now! thou art disturb'd; thy colour changesâ What, art thou silent? Seb. [aside.] Ah! I am betray'd. Xer. Ungrateful vassal! pale with dread, Too late thy looks appear; When first thy dark design was laid, 'Twas then a time for fear. But ever wise are Heaven's decrees, Which nothing can withstand: The traitor ne'er his danger sees Till shipwreck is at hand. [Exit. SCENE XI. Sebastes alone. Disloyal princess! hast thou then betray'd me? Insensate! shall I rashly dare to accuse her? And does a traitor now complain of treason? This have I well deserv'd.âAh! fly, Sebastes, But whither? From myself I cannot fly, And in my breast I bear my own tormentor. Where'er I go will terror and remorse Pursue my steps and set my crime before me. Ye cruel pangs that mortals know, When these on guilt attend; Ah! wherefore, heavenly Powers, so slow A traitor's heart to rend? Ye dreadful voices! ever near, Whose sounds my bosom chill, Why not till now my trembling ear With warning terrors fill? [Exit. SCENE XII. The palace. An altar with fire kindled, and upon the altar the cup prepared for the oath. Xerxes, Aspasia, Neocles, Satraps, Guards and People. Xer. Why, Neocles, so sad? Whence, fair Aspasia, Those starting tears? Now, when the father comes To swear to me his faith, the children mourn. Are then the friendship and the love of Xerxes By you disastrous deem'd? Speak. Asp., Neoc. O! ye Powers! SCENE XIII. Enter Roxana, Lysimachus and Greeks. Rox. What would'st thou with Roxana? Lys. Xerxes, say, Why am I summon'd hither? Xer. 'Tis my will Roxana and Lysimachus be present. Lys. To witness now some new affront to Athens? Rox. To bear again my injuries unmov'd? Lys. To see the inconstancy of false Aspasia? Asp. You are deceiv'd: afflict me not unjustly, Cruel Lysimachus. Believe me still The same Aspasia, nor oppress a mind Already sunk with grief. Xer. What do I hear! Are you then lovers? Asp. To conceal it longer Were hopeless: I've already said too much. Xer. And didst thou not, Aspasia, promise Xerxes To give to him thy hand? Asp. A father's life Requir'd this sacrifice. Xer. [to Lys.] And didst not thou Seek to his foes to render up the father Of her thy soul ador'd? Lys. So Athens will'd. Xer. [aside.] Transcendent virtue! Rox. See the Grecian leader Is now at hand. Neoc. [aside.] Why wears not Neocles A look like his, intrepid and serene? [looking out on his father. Asp. O! feeble heart, how dost thou tremble now! SCENE XIV. Enter Themistocles. Xer. At length, Themistocles, thou hast resolv'd To be the friend of Xerxes: once again Return to meet the embraces of a king Who honours thusâ [advances to embrace him. Them. Forbear. [drawing back respectfully. Xer. And why forbear? Them. I am not worthy yetâMy merits now Rest on the solemn act that brings me here. Xer. See on the altar, for the rite prepar'd, The cup with beverage crown'd.âThemistocles, Approach, and, with the vow requir'd, begin The chastisement of Greece. Them. Attend me, Xerxes: Know first, thou art deceiv'd: I promis'd here My presence, not my oath. Xer. How! Them. Hear me, Xerxes, And thou, Lysimachus, hear all ye people, Assembled thus spectators, hear and judge Themistocles with truth; and each be now His witness and defender.âAdverse fate Compels me here to incur the guilt of treason, Or black ingratitude: no choice remains But this, to hold or to relinquish life, The liberal gift of Heaven.âTo keep me still Without a crime I see one only way, The way that leads to deathâthat choice be mine. Lys. What do I hear! Xer. Eternal Gods! Them. This poison, [takes it from his bosom. Companion ever in my mournful exile, Mix'd with the draught yon sacred cup contains, Shall make the work complete. [pours the poison into the cup. âAnd every God, That reads my heart, be present at the offering A willing victim makes; a victim here To loyal truth, to gratitude and honour. Asp. I feel my senses fail. Xer. I'm struck with wonder. Them. Lysimachus, my friend, do thou assure My country of my love, and plead at least Indulgence for my ashes.âI forgive The worst of fortune if I find a tomb Where first I found a cradle.âMighty king! Repent not of thy benefits conferr'd, The admiring world shall be their recompense. All I can now repay thee (cruel Fate!) Is to profess my gratitude and die. Ye gracious Powers! if e'er the dying vows Of those who know not guile ascend to Heaven, Protect your Athens! To your care receive This king and kingdom: in the heart of Xerxes Inspire the wish to war with Greece no more: Yes, Xerxes, with my life conclude thy hatred. Friend! children! king and people, all farewell! [takes the cup. Xer. Ah! holdâwhat dost thou? Touch not with thy lip The deadly cup. Them. And wherefore? Xer. Never, never Shall Xerxes thus permitâ Them. And why, my king? Xer. Too many causes rush upon my mind To speak them now. [takes the cup from him. Them. Thou canst not, Xerxes, take From me the means of death: this power alone Is not allow'd to kings. Xer. Ah! live, the hero, [throws away the cup. The glory of our age! Still love thy country, To this I now consent; she's worthy of thee. Even Xerxes' self almost begins to love her: And who could ever hate the happy soil, The glorious mother of a son like thee? Them. Ye Gods! can this be true? So far beyond My best of hopes! Xer. Hear then the great effects Of virtuous emulationâOn this altar, For you prepar'd to swear eternal hatred, I vow eternal amity with Greece. Now let her rest, and owe, illustrious exile, To such a citizen her wish'd repose. Them. O! generous king! what art hast thou attain'd To triumph o'er Themistocles? Such virtue Exceeds a mortal's aim.âO Greece! O Athens! O! happy, happy exile! Asp. Rapturous moment! Neoc. O! prosperous day! Lys. Permit me, noble friends, To sail for Greece, and there to all proclaim Your generous strife of honour; well I know Alike for both her gratitude will warm; For him, who thus asserts his country's cause, And him, whose godlike gift ensures her peace. SCENE LAST. Enter Sebastes. Seb. For all my crimes, my sovereign lord, I here Entreat the punishment: I hate a life That thus to youâ [kneels. Xer. Sebastes, rise: this day Shall only know content: I pardon thee. I render back Aspasia's promise given, And leave her heart her own: my royal faith I plight to recompense Roxana's love. Asp. My dear Lysimachus! Rox. Ah! generous Xerxes! Them. O! grant, ye Gods! Themistocles may prove Still grateful to his king. Xer. Implore the Gods To guard thy life, and I shall find thee grateful; And if my virtue kindle from th' example Thy virtue gives, thou render'st back to Xerxes Far more than Xerxes ever gave to thee. Chorus. From emulation virtue grows With added splendor bright: So torch to torch united glows, And yields redoubled light. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
