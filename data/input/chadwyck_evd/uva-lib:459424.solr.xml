      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Julius CÃ¦sars Ghost. What not one prodigie to rouze thee, Rome, And give loud warning that great CÃ¦sar's come? What not one peale of thunder to proclaime, And echo from thy seven proud hills the fame Of my arrivall? is my weight so light It cannot force one dismall grone t'affright And wake thy Genius? is the ground thus rent, And Julius like an exhalation sent From the black womb of hell, yet cannot strike An Earthquake in thy brest? I like, I like Such dire forerunners. What? before my fall, In Romes great Forum, upon every stall, A bird of Night was percht in midst of day, And when black Night her mantle did display (As if the Stygian people had forsooke Their pitchy harbours, and possession tooke Of th'upper world) the Aire was fill'd with streams Of rowling fires, and the presaging dreams Of Citizens were broke by dismall frights Caus'd by the confus'd noise of walking sprights: And is my rise so full of silence? Thunder. So, Now stubborne Rome I'l thunder forth thy woe. CÃ¦sar must be reveng'd, and to thy cost. Alas thou canst not bribe my wronged Ghost, With the vaine fiction of thy Julian starre; VVere I but stellified indeed I'd mar Thy pride with such an influence should convay Submission through thy blond, and cast a ray Should light a Sun to rule the Roman world Without a Colleague: yet this fate is hurl'd Through thy own blindnesse on thy cursed head, And with such plagues to usher't, as thy dead, Thy butcher'd Julius from his soul abhor'd; My glory was, that Fortune did afford That royall power to doe thee good I would, And Nature heart to will the good I could. But I was too too mild; a heavier hand Shall make thee stoop to Soveraign command, And kisse the yoak, though sullied first and died In thine own gore; a sourge shall check thy pride; The dayes of Sylla shall return, and bloud Swim down thy streets in as profuse a floud, As ere his black proscriptions made, the sword Shall be as free as then, the Slave his Lord, The Wife her Husband shall betray, the Son Thinking the vitall thread of's Father spun To a too tedious length, and that his feet Travel too slowly to the grave, shall greet His age with death; The Senators shall drink Of the same cup of slaughter too, and think The burden easy, for, A sudden death Is sweet to them that scorn a slavish breath. Each Proscripts head shall bear a weighty rate, And Piety be treason to the State. Thus, Rome, shalt thou be plagued, and among Thy other evills lose thy sacred Tongue, The great Patritian of the speaking Art, Then shal thy griefs lie fettered in thy heart, And speak no other language but of tears; Words shall be strangled by thy stupid fears. Exit. Enter Marcus Cicero. Now ought we to give thanks unto the Gods That now at length the Fathers of the Publick With free unforced judgments dare lay open The sick distempers, which disease and trouble The body Politique? me thinks in this I see some gleame of liberty break forth And promise to the State a milder sunshine, Then, since our late unbridled Phaetons Usurpt the Roman heav'n, we have been blest with. As for my self, though now grown old and feeble In my lov'd Countreys service, I have yet As good a heart as ever to defend her. What though my voice did seem a while supprest? My heart did nourish an untainted love Of the Republick, which in zealous flames 'Has now discharg'd it self in th'face of Antony That Traitor to the freedome of his Countrey; I did defend while but a Youth, the State, I will not now I am grown old forsake it; I have contemn'd, the swords of Catiline; I will not now fear his. Some twenty yeers agoe I well remember I said Death could not to a Consular Be immature; how much more truly now May I pronounce unto an aged man? Now may I wish for Death, yet from my heart Two things I doe desire, and pray for; one, That I may leave the Roman people free, Th'immortall Gods cannot bestow upon mee A greater blessednesse: the other's this; That all may meet with a proportion'd fate, As their deserts have been unto 'the State. Enter Laureas. Laur. Your Brother Quintus Sir. Marc. Intreat him hither. Enter Qu. Cicero, and Philologus. Brother you'r welcome: How does thy Pomponia, And my young Cozen? Quint. Both my Wife and Sonne Are (heaven be thankt) as well as my best wishes Can fancy they would have them; and my Wife Presents her love, my Son his duty to you. Marc. They cannot by a better messenger, For you are Monarch of Pomponia's love, And Sov'raigne of his duty; these are titles Good in Oeconomy, but once thrust out Make heavy hearts in State when they return; You have not heard of Antony's proceedings Since he departed to Brundusium? Quint. Not one word. Marc. I collect the Consuls drift; But why doe I the State that injury To style him Consul that so governs it, That leads his life so, and was so created? His aim I know's at those four Legions Transported from the Macedonian Province At his appointment thither by his brother; Twere dangerous he should win them; but I have A surer confidence in the Martiall Legion, For it has ever been extoll'd as much For its integrity toth'State as prowesse; The fourth is under conduct of the QuÃ¦stor Egnatuleius, a brave Citizen And valiant man, so that I cannot doubt But hee'l be partly frustrate. Then CÃ¦sars posting to Campania Puts me in hope, 'tis to procure the Colonies There resident, to side with him, against Antonius; for you know the Noble youth Will not bee checkt by him. But Brother Quintus I have some private matters: which require A more retired conference; take a seat. Laureas. How does my fellow Academick? canst Digest my Lords discourse of Summum bonum? Philol. 'Tis somewhat tough, methinks; but Laureas Which hadst thou rather be? An Epicure? A Stoick? or Peripatetick? tell mee. Laur. Why faith before I was infranchiz'd boy, The Stoick would have furnisht mee compleatly, I should have laugh'd a cudgell in the face, And swore a bed of straw had been as soft As wool, or doune of Ermins. I should then Have stood as stout as Atlas with a burden Weighty as his upon my brawny shoulders; But since I did with thee shake off the Name And Nature of a slave, and serve my Lord More for affection then constraint, I could Sometimes methinks shake hands with Epicurus. Marc. It must be so. But brother since your hast Hinders your longer stay, let me entreat you Philologus a while may bear me company. Quint. With all my heart. Marc. My love unto Pomponia. Quint. I will; Farewell. Marc. Farewell good brother Quintus. Exit. Qu. Philologus and Laureas come let's hear How you have relisht your Philosophy. Phil. My Lord, your Laureas relishes extreamly, For he is almost turn'd an Epicure. Cicero. An Epicure! Laur. Not I my Lord, I told him Virtue which in a proud conceit neglected The due preservatives of the weaker nature, And was estranged from that first-born dictate Of making natures union, if'twere possible, Immortall, by a competent cherishing Of either part, and in an extasie Like an Intelligence, all Soul and Reason, Was wholly taken up with mentall beauties; Was like a table furnisht with rare viands, But not a dish prepar'd with Condimentall Provocatives to make the relish kind; For Virtue is, we know, a fruitlesse, rude, Impolisht treasure, without use and action, Which give it taste and life, now to the use Health, wealth and liberty are requisite, Though not essentiall unto Virtues self, That root of goodnesse. Thus you may see my Lord, Laureas is neither Epicure nor Stoick; 'Twas only the comparison which made Your shallow-brain'd Scholastick think I was One of the Kitchen; but were I a hog Of Epicures fraternity, yet his brain Should not be th'Atalanta to unhead me. Cicer. Why here's no sign of Epicure in this, 'Tis currant and Authentick. Phil. True, but Sir, He harpt upon another string even now. Yet, since he is so cunning, pray my Lord Let me be Stoicall a while, and try Whether he be sound as he pretends. Laur. Pish, there's a face to act a Stoick with! Make me beleeve the Goddesse Venus thought She was embrac't by Mars, when 'twas young Adon With whom she dallyed. Give me one shall look With as severe a countenance as Cato When he unshackled his Heroick soule. Cicer. No more of him, I pray, unlesse yu would Make fountains of my eyes; but Laureas You have the fittest visage for a Stoick, It shall be your part. Laur. Then my Noble Lord, Suppose I had ingrost the Stoick wisdome Within my bosome, and were now brought forth To some unheard of torture: thus I'd stand, And thus I'd dare the utmost of their furies. Vain Mortalls, doe you think my fearlesse soule Is capable of pains? why, tear this flesh From off my bones; you touch not mee: for know This is not Laureas but his robe. Extract The very quintessence of the strongest poisons, I'l quaffe it as I would divinest Nectar, And think it but a draught of Immortality: Cast me alive into a den of Lions, I will embrace my destiny, and deem The loudest accent of their spatious throats But as a trumpet to proclaime my triumphs. I would not bellow in Perillus engine, But like the Swan in Tybers silver streams Sing my own dirge with an unwrinckled note. Nay, more then this, the disunited Heavens Tumbling upon my head should not affright me, Yea the confused ratling of their ruines Should be as ravishing harmony to my ears, As now they make in their cÅlestiall sphears. Now, Sir, suppose the anger of some tyrant Had thrust me from the bosome of my Countrey, From the embraces of a faithfull spouse, And the sweet pledges of our mutuall loves, And I were wandring in some wildernesse, Within whose gloomy shades was never heard The Daulian minstrell, but the boding tones Of Owles, and Night-ravens, and in every bush Lay coucht a Lion, Tiger, or a Wolfe: Would I sit musing in a dumpish passion? And cry, O Times! O Manners! no my Lord, A wise man does not tie his house, or home To the tuition of one private I ar, Nor does he bound what men their Countrey call To the straight limits of one State or Kingdome; Though Thule were the place of my Nativity, Yet should the Gades be my countrey too. I have a little world within my selfe, And shall one narrow Landskip claim me hers? Now for those petty dangers I defie them, A wise man carries in his sacred front The character of Majesty, which brutes Though ne'r so wild and savage must adore. As for my Wife and Children they were given mee Not for Ã¦ternity, and as good be sever'd By exile as by death: had I still liv'd Dividing my indulgent soule among them, I might perhaps have seen my loving Wife Ravisht before my face, I might have seen My Childrens brains knockt out against the stones, And dasht in my own wounded eyes, but now I shall not view those clouds. Thus had I been Unhappy, had I not unhappy been. And now my honor'd Lord, with wonder hear, How in a yet unparallel'd Affliction Your Stoick Laureas would demean himselfe. Suppose my Lo.âO how my heart-strings ake To utter't! yea it makes me clean forget The Stoick whom I personate: I say SupposeâO hold me good Philologus. The very thought will strike me deadâsuppose My bosome Friend, my faithfull Pylades, My second selfe, even my Philologus, Were whipt clean through the streets of Rome &amp; cudgel'd Till his bones crackt again, d'yee think I'd weep? Lift up my eyes, and cry, O cursed Heavens Which suffer innocence thus to be afflicted! Now, my Lord, I'd doe an Act of wonder Which after Ages should admire; I'd down And in the Cellar all my sorrows drown. Cicer. I'st come to this? you are a wanton Laureas. Laur. 'Tis Stoicall my Lord. Cicer. Well let it be so. But since you think you could so sweetly sing In th'engine of Perillus; let me hear you Out of't. for I'm perswaded you might frame Your voice a great deal better to a song In a far colder place. Laur. 'Tis true my Lord; But I spoke like a Stoick. Cicer. Be not modest. Begin: but let your song be sage, and grave, Such as a Vestall need not blush to hear. Rip up the Vices of the State, that while You sing, my wounded heart may bleed for sorrow. Song. Laur. How happy was the Roman State? When her chiefest Magistrate Was rais'd to the fasces from the plow? When such as Cincinnatus sway'd The helme of th'Common-wealth, and made Her proudest Adversaries humbly bow To th'self same yoak wherewith they us'd to check The stubbornnesse of th'toiling heisers neck? How sacred was the Roman Name? How shining was our virgin fame? When in their homes our bravest men Had nothing glorious but themselves? When he who now in quarries delves, For golden ore as low as Pluto's den, Was deem'd a Paricide, and had the doome Of one who rent his Mothers sacred wombe? How happy were we then, how blest, When the Republick was possest Of those ancient Palinures? When Curius and Fabricius led Her Armies, which for dainties fed On boiled Turneps? then the easie cures Of her more temp'rate body soon were wrought, Her health with little losse of bloud was bought. But since the Asian luxurie Has crept into our veins, and we No lesse for fame in dishes strive Then if we had the conquest wonne Of the stout Hamilcars sonne, Or brought the treacherous Syphax home alive To grace, our Triumphs: now a thousand paines Lie brooding in the States corrupted veins. The Common-wealth is ful of tumors, And each day repugnant humors Threaten the downfall of this frame; Her constitution is too weak To harbour such gueste, and not break, Unlesse some pitying Deity quench the flame. Bee thou our Ãculapius mighty Jove, And send some healing influence from above. Philologus and Laureas together. Be thou our Ãsculapius mighty Jove, And send some healing influence from above. Cicer. So here's a Song has fire in't, Poetrie; O 'tis the language of the Gods when Virtue Is made her theam; they prostitute the Muses, And turn Parnassus to a stews, that cloath Their unwasht fancies in these sacred weeds. Enter Quintus Cicero. Marc. Brother so soon? your countenance me thinks Tells me your bosome travails with some newes, And fain would be deliver'd. Quint. Sir, Octavius Is with an Army at the gates. Mar. Octavius? Why, that's not Hannibal. Quint. But the Citizens Suspect a more then Panick treachery; For those that saw the Consul and Octavius So lately reconcil'd in the Capitoll, Will not beleeve these forces are contracted To oppose Antonius; but that covertly Both have complotted one to aid the other In the promotion of their aimes; that Antony May gain the Soveraignty, and Octavius Revenge on those which slew his unkle Julius. Enter Tyro. Tyr. Carnutius, Sir, the Tribune of the people Desires some conference with your Lordship. Mar. Quintus, He's a profest foe to Antonius, And friend to CÃ¦sar. Bring the Tribune in. Enter Carnutius. Car. Octavius is return'd. Mar. I, so I hear, Car. And brought along with him ten thousand souldiers. I have explor'd his aimes, and they are whole For opposition of the Consul Antony Whom he has much endamag'd. Mar. How Carnutius? Car. By spies, which he has closely had about him Still crossing and opposing his proceedings, And with such good successe, as now the Legions Are even upon desertion of his party Especially the Fourth and Martiall. Mar. Tribune, Informe the people how the youth's affected, And Ile procure he shall be straight brought in; For I'm perswaded, since he is return'd Antonius enemy, the provident Senate Will not be so injurious to the State And their own safeties, as deny him entrance, Yea, I presume they will with glad consent Meet the first motion of his entertainment. Car. They wil no doubt; Come let's dispatch my Lo. Exeunt. Enter Piso and Salvius. Salv. Me thinks th'admittance of Octavius, Will much endamage Antony. Piso. I fear it, And doubt not but he will be shortly here: But what dost think of this young upstart, Salvius? It cannot enter Piso's head, that zeal, To the Republick do's incite him to it. Salv. 'Faith Piso my opinion's this; I doubt The boy will prove at length another Iulius. Piso. And so think I. Salv. Was't ever known a youth Of his hot spirit, was so much devoted Unto his Countrey cause without some plot To strengthen his ambitious aims? well Piso, I am perswaded CÃ¦sars heart and countenance Are not Correlatives. Pis. And I fear our Orator, Although he think himself a profound Statist, Is but as 'twere a visor, which Octavius Covers the face of his close projects with: Well, mark the end, these now are but surmises, But they may prove oraculous. Let this passe. I think if Antony come he will not stay, You know he has determin'd to be Master Of the Cisalpiue Province. Salv. True, he has. Pis. Now when he's gone to Gaul, if Cicero Advice the Senate any thing against him, It must be our parts to oppose their counsells. Salv. It must. I'l second you, you know I may Doe much by virtue of the Tribuneship. Pis. 'Tis true, you may doe much indeed. Enter Messenger. Mess. The Consul Antonius is arriv'd; and, Lucius Piso, Desires your presence; to you, Salvius, He sends his love, and prays you to repaire Unto the Senate, which is newly convocated. Salv. Piso return my love, Ile thither straight. Ex. Enter Quintus Cicero. Pomponia. Pomp. How do's my Brother Marcus Cicero? Quint. Well my Pomponia, but would be far better Could he once see the Common-wealth in health. Pomp. Why, husband; what have States diseases too? Quint. They have my Sweet, and as old fathers die To make roome for posterity, so Chance Quits ancient States, that from their ruines may New ones arise. States have their severall ages Which carry some analogie with ours: Their small beginnings are their infancies. Their bold exploits to propagate their glories, Are like the flashes of ambitious Youth; When they are mounted to the highest pitch Decreed them in the starry Consistory, They are arriv'd to a state much like That which in us doth bear the name of Manhood. They stand not long on this high tower of Glory. But stealingly, as wee, doe fall away; Their sprightly vigour like a full-blown Rose Droops and decays, they suddenly contract Distempers; grow diseas'd, and finally Sink down into the grave of their own ruines The Babylonian and the Persian Monarchies Di'd of a Surfet; then the Macedonian Of a seditious quarrell in the Humours Striving to be predominant; Greece of a Meagrim; Carthage first was caught With an unruly Feaver, which at last Degenerated to an Ague, and Was quickly seconded by Death. But Rome (Only she never felt an Ague yet, Unlesse when Hannibal was at her gates) Is whole infected with a various mixture Of all together; she's ev'n grown a Spittle, An Hospitall of diseases which will sink Her glories to the first and ancient Nothing: But may that day be leaden heel'd, nor fall Within the compasse of this Age. Pomp. Fie Husband, This passion is not Roman. We may raise Our spirits with hopes of better times; CÃ¦sar affords us comfort. Quint. True Pomponia, But Rome has had a long succession Of State-usurpers, when this Hydra's head Is cut away, another may bud forth; Pray heaven we have no cause with that old Beldam Of Syracusa, in our fruitlesse wishes To dig our Ancient tyrants up again. Enter Marcus Cicero. Welcome from the Senate Brother, pray what news? How were things carryed? Mar. Nothing done at all. The Consul Antony came without all doubt To censure CÃ¦sars doings, but his mind It seem's was chang'd; for having said a little Touching the Provinces and Marius Lepidus, But not a word of CÃ¦sar, he departed. Quint. And what will follow think you? Mar. Sure he will not Stay long in Rome, for, as I hear, 'has sent His Army to Ariminum, no doubt With an intent to follow, then besides I think he dares not stay for fear of CÃ¦sar; For he return'd though proudly, yet but weakly With only one PrÃ¦tocian cohort with him. But 'tis grown something late, I must intreat you To let my Cousen Quintus guide me homeward. Quint. He will be proud to doe you such a service. Exeunt. Enter Antonius. Ant. What evill Genius crosses me? the Fourth And Martiall Legions sided with Octavius? For so I have receiv'd Intelligence; Well I'l to Alba, whither, as I heare, The Martiall Legion have betooke themselves. I will not thus be thwarted by a boy, Enter Fulvia. A mungrell; sooner shall a Bee or Gnat Stop the proud Eagle in his airy course, And heaven be scaled by a band of Pygmies. Let Cicero call him Romes Junonian boy, And truly golden off-spring of his Mother, Let the whole Senate hug him, as they doe; Yet will I choak and ruine all their hopes, I'l send him naked home to his first Nothing, And make him answer to Thurinus: what? Is not the Family of th'Antonii Deriv'd from Anton son to Hercules? And shall these sons of Earth confront mee thus? The stellifi'd Alcides shall not lose The cheerfull lustre of his rays, to see His bloud run muddy in his issues veins. Fulv. I like this spirit, Mark, methinks I see The world already prostrate at thy feet, Cherish this fire: Ã´ wer't thou all compos'd Of these Heroick flames, Fulvia would be To such a Jove another Semele. Anton. Spoke like thy glorious self: yet, Fulvia, Passion or indiscretion may contemn him, But when I weigh his Actions in the ballance Of serious and more accurate Construction, I find he has no base or common soul, And does as well inherit CÃ¦sars heart, And courage, as his name: besides he has The counsells of experienc'd heads to steer His Actions by; so that he's now above The pitch of my disdain: with strong-nerv'd eys, Like a young Eagle, he confronts our Sun. Fulv. What cool'd so soon? Octavius an Eagle? A Scarab rather. He an Eagle Antony? He's but a Ganymed in an Eagles claw: The Octavian family never yet was nest To such a kingly bird. But who I pray Are those experienc'd heads you talk of? what? Is that Tongue-valiant Cicero worth the fear Of Fulvia's Antony? No doubt but he who has of late divorc't His Wife Terentia, and in her place Made a young Girle his consort, may as soon Supplant Antonius, and set up that boy: O 'twas great policy to exercise Himselfe upon the weaker sex at first; Your turne is next: the Hawk thus tries his talons Upon some meaner prey, before he ventures To grapple with the Eagle or the Heron. Anton. I think Minerva's self dwells in thee Fulvia, Such words as these might fire the coldest bosome, And by strong Alchymie transmure a heart Of Leaden temper, to a golden Purity. Were young Octavius indeed an Eagle, And nested in the bosome of Great Jove, I'd pluck him thence: As for that Cicero, My feare, if I had any, should not be Pitcht on so base an object: I will make That Inmate know what 'tis to write my life, H'ad been as good have publisht to the world The mystick name of Rome. But let that Cerberus Proceed to belch his poisonous vomit forth At view of light; yet shall his unwasht mouth One day repent that biting impudence. Fulv. And there may come a time when Fulvia Shall be revenged on his wormwood jeers. O how my entralls boil! my heart's on fire: Had I his damned tongue within my clutthes, This bodkin should in bloody characters Write my revenge. Ant. Come Fulvia, be content, Let him triumph, and in his proud conceit Frame to himself a conquest great as Joves Over those sons of Earth, and parallel His verball thunder with the voice of Heaven, Yet may I one day be that stronger Typhon Shall cut the sinews of his insolence, And place thee Juno in this Romes Olympus. Come kisse me Sweeting, though the drousie Sol Have not yet left the bosome of his Thetis, Yet here's no nightly shade, for from thine eyes Breakes a more glorious day. I could, my beauty, For ever dwell in thy divine embraces, But I must leave thee, yea and that before Aurora's first blush gilds, the East; thou knowst My Armie is sent before unto Ariminum, And I must follow; I will have the Province Of Decimus Brutus; I, I will, that's certain, By fair or foul means; Julius my Colleague Return'd from Gaul so happily establisht, Great Pompey's selfe was vanquisht by his Eagles. I know an Army will be soon sent after, And war proclaim'd against me as an enemy To th'State, if once I offer violence To Decimus, but I'm resolv'd, and should The whole world rise against me, what I've said I'l prosecute to ruine or fruition. Only my Fulvia doe but thou molest My foes at home by opposite authority. There's Lucius Piso, Lucius, Philippus, Fusius Calenus, Salvius, Lucius CÃ¦sar, Servius Sulpitius too, and many others My speciall friends: thou maist solicit them, They'l not be backward in my glorious cause. Come I'l goe kisse the pledges of our bed, And then for Mutine; there my hopes are fed. Exeunt. Chorus. Is there such sweetnesse in dominion? Or is it only fond opinion? Is there such pleasure in the height Of greatnesse? or is't meer conceit? Sure if the glories of a throne Were in their proper colours shown, It would appear the highest place Is pleasant only in the face; A King is but a Royall slave, And Rule a Vassallage more brave; A Scepter's but a glorious name, A Crown the burden of the same Proud front which it adorns; but Peace And stedfast joy with full increase Salute the cottage of the Swaine; There Quiet harbours, where Disdaine Doth fix a scornfull brow, but where The eye of Envy's feasted, there A thousand discontents dor dwell, O 'tis a second second Hell. Why then, O why distressed Rome, Doe thy Vipers rend thy wombe, To be possessors of a light So prejudiciall to the sight? Unhappy Rome, did Julius die For affected Tyranny? And must Antonius inherit The aimes of his Ambitious spirit? Yet in this thrice happy State, That thou hast an Advocate Dares plead thy Griefs, and to his face Tell thy proud Enemie be is base, Base in his life, and base to thee, An hater of thy liberty. O bug so rare a Stalists worth, Let thy Matrons Caroll forth His praise, and crown his aged haires: Not with Laurell wreaths, but prayers. Long maist thou live brave man, &amp; have When dead a soft and peacefull grave!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus. Cicero. So now methinks I see our common Foe Already crusht with ruine; he shall know Ambition is a precipice, and the sky At which he aimes his shafts to be too high. Were it the cause though 'twere ground enough To build a setled confidence upon. Air honest cause in mouth of ruine sings, 'Tis the good genius of a State, and brings Down Jove himselfe to side with her: but more 'Tis Brutus whom Antonius copes with, Brutus The Omen of whose very name, and bloud Fatall to State-usurpers were sufficient To fortifie our drooping souls, and raise them From thought of servitude. But then besides; Three Armies have we sent to succour him; Two under Aulus Hirtius, and Pansa, Our late elected Consulls. Young Octavius Have we made Generall of the third; A youth Ordain'd by Heaven to doe his Countrey good. And yet before this war was brought about, What oppositions did I meet withall. Piso withstands it, Salvius seconds him, The Consular Calenus makes a third. The matter is adjourn'd. Till at the last Ambassadours must be sent to Antony To treat of Peace; A thing, in my conceit, Of little credit to the Senatours; For what could bee more base, more full of levity Then to send messengers of Peace to him Whom, but a little before they had condemn'd As enemy to's Countrey, and Republick, By severall decrees, as CÃ¦sars Honors, The great Rewards of th'Legions that forsook him, Th'Assignment of the Consuls to the wars? As also their most ample commendations Of Brutus and his Army, which the Province Of Gaul did plainly intimate: moreover There was great danger in't; for could the City Be safe, when it should Antony immure, Or rather Antonies within her bosome, Which like a nest of Serpents would torment her, And never cease to stab with banefull stings Till they had wrought a passage to the heart? Lastly, it was not possible there should Be peace confirm'd with him, for not the Senate Nor Citizens could affect him, nor he them, Both had condemn'd him, he injur'd both. Well, Legates are dispatcht; yet nothing done; Antony is still as insolent as ever: Then must a second Embassie be enter'd; And I am one elected for that service. O Heavens! with what distempered wounded eyes Should I have lookt that Monster in the face? Who in a publick Concion had decreed My goods unto Petissius of Urbin, One who but newly from the utter shipwrack Of a no mean but rich inheritance Was crept to those Antonian rocks for shelter? My tender eye-balls never could have born The hated sight of Saxo, Capho, Bistia, Hostilius and Vesenius. O I should Have seen the very visage and aspect Of Civill war it selfe. But this Legation Was found at length a meer device and trick To hinder with delays the Senates care In preparation for the war. Yet see A new demur obtruded; M. Lepidus Our Generall beyond the Alps, cohorts The Senate by Ambassadors to th'peace; Hereat the former Advocates take heart, And plead th'authority of Lepidus, As if that plea could quench the zealous flames Which were then kindled in the Senates brests. But all in vain. Our armies are launcht forth 'Gainst that Arch-pirate of the State Antonius. And now we daily with our prayers solicite The ears of heaven to free the Common-wealth Of such a dangerous and infectious plague, Which like a gangrene would run on and spread To the destruction of the body Politick: But to strike down such monsters Jove has thunder, And wee have armes to presse this viper under. Exit Enter Pomponia. Pomp. Phillis come hither. Phil. Madame. Pomp. Are the Roomes Perfum'd as I commanded? Phil. Yes. Pomp. And all things Done as I gave directions? Phil. All things Madam. Pomp. Well. Exit Phil. But I need not be so punctuall, My Brother Marcus, as he is no stranger, So not so curious, as our other Romans. As for my selfe, I'm none of those which waste Whole Mornings in the fruitlesse contemplation Of their supposed beauties in a glasse; I have not learn'd to paint and daub my face With borrow'd colours, mine's a native grace, And, if it please my Quintus, 'tis enough. Nor am I in the list of those which spend Their husbands faculties on loose attires, On rings, and bracelets, or a glittering toy To dangle in my eare, my Ornaments And Jewells are the Vertues of my Quintus. Enter Philologus. Phil. Madam, my Lord your Brother's newly enter'd. Exit Pomponia, Manet Phil. Enter Laureas and Tyro. Laur. Here's a triplicity of Libertines! How does my little Phil? Phil. O Sir the better To see your Stoickship in health: but, Sirrah, What is yon Tyro doing? Laur. Ha! let's see. Why, poring on a fragment of Heradotus The Grandfire (as he calls him) of Historians A kind of vermine he's enamour'd with: And he himself has got an itching humour To be of that fraternity. Phil. I'faith! Nay then we'l furnish him. Most learned Tyro Have you not heard the news? Tyro. Ha. News? What news? Phil. Why tis reported, and that credibly, How Atlas being weary of his burden, As sure he well may be, and if you ever Beheld his picture with that mighty globe Upon his back, hee looks but sowrely ou't: Well, Atlas being weary as I told you, To ease his shoulders, lifted up his arme, Some say it was his right arm, some his left, But that's not so materiall; you observe! Lifting his arm above his head to keep The Sphear a while from's back, he chanc't to thrust His thumb into a star, and burnt it off. Laur. Tyro, he's missinform'd; 'twas thus old boy. About the time when the all-seeing Sun Mounted the raging Lions back, this Atlas, This living Columne of the arched Heavens, Distilling from his hot and sweating brows As much Salt waters as might turn a Sea Fresh as our Tiber, to a brinish sowrnesse. And truly, were that scorching season constant, Well might the Nation of Philosophers Cease their intestine broiles about the saltnesse Of the vast Ocean, and determine safely The sweat of Atlas were the genuine cause. Well Atlas sweltring, as I said, and sending Whole clouds of vapours from his boiling entrails, Erects his brawny arme, and so sustaines That azure fabrick, while he stoopes to reach A draught or two of Nilus in his palme; But as he stoops, he thus behind him throws His leg, and by ill fortune popt his foot Into the hot Trinacrian hill; and so (O sad dystaster!) burnt his little toe. Ty. I thought your Mount at length would be deliver'd Of a ridiculous Mouse. But what's this all? Phil. I, here's enough at once, too much wil glut you. Tyro. Glut me! by Castor I'm as lank and thin As if ChamÃ¦leon-like I had been fed Of nought but Aire. This have I only chew'd on Since (to usurp Laureas inspired Notion) The Sun lashe up his fiery Teem from the Blushing Ocean. Laur. How the Rogue hobbles! 'slight he makes the Muses Halt, and their God Apollo goe on crutches. Phil. No matter Laureas, you must attribute it To th'faintnesse of his stomach, which I'l quicken With some supply. Stay here, while I goe in, And if I meet with an extravagant Capon, Or some such Pilgrim, I'l direct him hither. Laur. Well said; but Sirrah, you know what I love, A cup of rich Falern, you Rogue, or some Extracted Nectar of the Formian grape. Phil. Ile furnish you immediately. Exit. Laur. I wonder What foolish humour Pindarus was in, When he begun his Poems with the praise Of that weak Element Water: 'slight blind Homer Was an old Soker at it, and the Father Of our brave Roman Laureats Ennius, Before he dipt his sacred quill in bloud, Would steep his braines in this Castalian liquor; Drencht in this juice he could more proudly look Bellona in the face, then ere Achilles Dipt by his Mother in the Stygian lake. Enter Philologus. Laur. So soone Philologus? Tyro. What's here? Phil. Why, Tyro, The remnant of a martyr'd quarter'd Goose. Tyro. I thought introth this would be one of your Extravagant pilgrims; for it is reported, That Geese have travail'd on their feet to Rome Ev'n from the Marishes of the Morini. What bird is this? 'tis a young Goose I warrant. Laur. How, a young Goose? Phil. He's one that said so rather. Tyro. No Rogue, Ile leave that title to Philosophers, With whom the Geese are so enamoured. For I have read in story of one Lacydes, Of your bald tribe affected by a Goose, With such an ardent zeal; that day and night Abroad, at home, at board, and in his bed, She would be with him: and I am perswaded There are but few of that profession Can leap a Span from Goose. Laur. The Rogue's Satyricall. Tyro. Nay there are Poets too of this Affinity. Know you not Anser, he who sings the praise Of Antony in verse? Laur. And witty too. Phil. But 'tis a Partridge Tyro. Tyro. Ha! a Partridge. Laur. Come leave this prattle, he will tell you now How Mulciber the Ferrian Prince was Hawking, And a poor Partridge, such a one as this, Mewted in's mouth, only for sincere dread Of the pursuing Hawk: but you young Rascall Here's that has life in't. Phil. Come. Drinks to Philolog. Phil. Historicall Tyro. Drinks to Tyro, Tyro takes it. Tyro. What's this? Laur. 'Tis wine, pure wine. Tyro. But Romulus The Father of this City knew not wine, Milke was his drinke. Laur. That was in Romes infancy, Come drink you Coxcombe. Tyro. Ha, methinks it smiles Like an ungirdled Maiden. Laur. Are you there? Phil. I see these scribling. Fablers are fly creatures Laur. There's my Lords biting Mastix Salust, last Was found at th'sport. Phil. I, and I think belabour'd To th'purpose for his paines. Tyr. 'Tis something pleasant. 'Twere good this Vacuum were again replenisht. Laur. Come, come let's fall aboard. They eat. Tyro. I see you Rascals, you are no Pythagoreans. Phil. Why Tyro? w'are as still as they. Tyro. 'Tis true. But they t'enure themselves to abstinence Would cause a Table to be richly furnisht With costly viands, and then sit them downe To feast their eyes upon the severall dishes, But not to tast a bit, for when their mouths Had watred long o'r the inticing dainties, A waiter was commanded to remove, And so with empty stomachs all departed. Laur. A fine device to make a living Ghost on. But Tyro, Here boy. Drinks. Wine, why 'tis the Soul Of History; me thinks in this small glasse I see a Volume of brave Heroes Acts In Letters capitall: here I read the Trophies Of Bacchus fetcht from the remotest India; Here I peruse the battail of such fame, Between the Centaures and the Lapathites, The sack of Troy, and many other things As well recorded in this fluid Monument, As in the strongest Adamantine tables. Tyro. I may in time make use of this sweet doctrine Enter Marcus Cicero, Quintus Cicero, Quintus jun. Laur. My Lord by PhÅbus. Mar. So, so, I perceive You have been at it, 'tis well done, but Tyro What news from Mutine? you were ever wont To be inquisitive. Tyr. None but this my Lord: 'Tis for a truth given out, that Decimus From the besieged Town convey'd a Letter To th'Army of the Consulls by a Kestrell. Mar. How weak alas, to what small purpose tend The plots of State-usurpers in the end? How are Antonius projects crost? he thought With scouts and trenches to cut off intelligence Between the Consulls and the Town, and spread Nets o'r the surface of the neighbouring river, Lest the swift waves should carry Brutus counsels. But all in vain, if through the yeelding Aire A winged post his embassie may beare. Enter Pomponia. Pomp. Alas, my Lord, the Town is full of uprores, Some cry out Antony, some, Wee are undone; Some, Marcus Brutus must be called home. Mar. Tyro, Go see whence springs this sad confusion. Exit. Tyro. Pomp. Some answer it is now too late, and others Affirm it were best to fly to him for succour. There's not a throat but hoarse with cries; An eye But drown'd in flouds of tears. The cause I know not. But yet I feare. Mar. If Antony have won the day (which heaven And heavens all-seeing Monarch Jove forbid) Wee are undone, there is no hope of succour Except in Brutus, which must be attain'd Not by his coming, but our flight to him, Unlesse the common voice mistakes; and danger Be not so nigh our dores, as it infers. But yet my soule is quiet, which was ever Wont to anticipate the common ills In her oraculous auguries. Ent. Tyr. Tyro. My Lord, There is a rumour spread throughout the City That Antony has overthrown the Consulls, And is now coming with his Troopes to Rome. Quint. Great Jove defend us. Marc. Heaven avert this evill. Tyr. And the Antonians within the City Are flockt together into Pompeys court. Mar. No doubt to broach some mischief 'gainst the State. Tyro. My Lord 'tis broacht already; for ther's rais'd Another bruit without all doubt by those Pernicious Citizens, only to divert The concourse of the people from your Lordship, That on the Ides of Aprill you've determin'd T'usurp the Fasces. Cic. Sure thou art deceiv'd, 'Tis meant some Ambitious thief, or sword-player, Or some new minted Catiline. Tyr. No my Lord; You are the man. Mar. O Heavens, that I who ruin'd The Counsells of base Catiline, should now Turne Catiline my selfe! is any man So lost, so wicked to raise this of me? So rash, so furious to beleeve it? Heavens! Enter Publius Apuleius. Alas good Tribune, how is Cicero wrong'd? Apul. I know you are, and therefore in a Concion Before the poople have I urg'd your innocence, And partly choakt the rumour. I propos'd All your endeavours for the Publick State Before their censures, and the whole Assembly Pronounc't they never yet could find you guilty So much as of a thought against the welfare, Of the Republick: but what noise is this? Qu. Hark, the late cries are turn'd to shouts me thinks. Quin. jun. I hear a cry of Victory in the streets. Marc. Tyro, Go see again, my heart presages Some sudden good. Ex. Tyr. Pomp. Hark, hark, the noise increases. Quint. I, and approaches neerer too me thinks. Apul. 'Tis at the dores. Enter Tyro and a Messenger. A shout. Tyro. Here's one my Lord can tell you. Mess. The Consuls (worthy Sir) have won the day. These will inform you better. Letters. Cicero reads. Marc. Brother Quintus A word or two in private. Antony Is put to flight, but Hirtius flain, and Pansa Dangerously wounded; for some private reasons Best known unto my selfe, I will conceale The Consulls death, which I may doe compleatly, For here's a Letter sent from Hirtius Unto the Senate of a former victory: This will remove suspect. Shout. Tyro. The Roman people Wait at the dore to bring you to the Capitoll. Mar. Thanks to the Gods, this day wee'l dedicate To Jove and Mars the savers of our State. Exeunt. Laur. Nay Madam stay, I feel an extasie Steal through my brest, and fire my plyant soul, You shall not goe without a Hymn of Victory. Pomp. Phillis, Clarinda, Galla, quickly come, Laureas begin, and these shall sing the Chorus. The Song. Laur. Have you not heard the Cities cry, How the people vent their joyes In the welcome welcome noyse Of victory? The Capitoll returnes their shout againe, As if it selfe would learn their joyfull straine. Chorus. Let Echo sing with long-spun notes, And Philmels caroll from their lubrick throats; Let Hills rebound, And vallies sound Io triumphe. Laur. The streets are fill'd with cheerfull glee, And the common mirth is showne In the pleasant pleasant tone Of Liberty; For now our Consuls have delivered Rome, And the disturber of her peace o'rcome. Chorus. Let Echo sing with, &amp;c, Laur. Great Jove we blesse thy Patronage; By whose high auspice Rome is sav'd The Roman State, and kept unslav'd Frominbred rage. And Mars we praise thee, by whose aid have stood The Roman walls so long, though built in blood. Chorus. Let Echo sing with long-spun notes, And Philmells caroll from their lubrick throats; Let Hills rebound, And vallies sound Io triumphe. Exeunt. Enter Senate. A shout. Cicer. Honor'd and Conscript Fathers, if those days Appear to us with far more welcome raies Wherein we are preserv'd, then those wherein To breath this common Aire we first begin, Because our safeties have a sure fruition Of gladnesse, but our births a frail condition, And that we doe our safeties entertain With pleasure, but Nativities with pain: How ought, we then t'embrace this happy light Which has redeem'd us from that sad affright Rais'd by domestick furies? yet we will not Return unto our civill robes, till tidings Be brought of Brutus safety, for this warre Was undertaken for his aid and succour, Against those enemies of the State, and is not Compleat but with his freedome first recover'd. Servilius. Although I am not Cicero of your mind Concerning the retaining of this robe Of war, yet I determine publick prayer Be made to all the Gods for twenty dayes In the three Generalls names. Cic. Which twenty dayes Publius Servilius I inhance to fifty, Since they are granted not to one but Three. Piso. But, M. Tullius, my opinion is This day to put our civill garments on, And to resume the Sage again to morrow. Calenus. And 'tis my judgment too. Cic. Yes, 'twould be gratefull To the immortall Deities to depart To put the Sage on from their hallowed Altars To which we came aray'd in civill robes? 'T were most enormous, and against Religion. Calen. Then Cicero your terms are too too harsh. You brand them with the name of Enemies; 'Tis too severe a style. We will allow them To be call'd wicked and audacious Citizens, But not their Countreys foes; and for this cause The Consulls Hirtius, Pansa, with Octavius Are not to be entituled Generalls. Cic. If the Antonians are not enemies, Then 'twas a great impiety to slay them; And if it were impiety to slay them, How can we hope our solemn supplication, Decreed for their destruction, should be pleasing To the immortall Deities? But Calenus Know I am not contented with a word Of such a slight conceit; if any man Will furnish me with one of deeper stain, I'l burn't into their names; for even by those Which spilt their sacred blonds for us at Mutine I know they doe deserv't. As for the Consulls And young Octavius whom we made our Chiefs, Their brave deserts have made them Generalls, For now that Prince of out-laws is or'thrown; The very Sun was happy, which before He hid his beams, beheld the breathlesse trunks Of those dead Parricides, and Antony For very feare with few Associates fly. Therefore I thus decree, That in the names Of the Three Generalls, fifty days together Be supplications made, which I will frame In the most ample words I can contrive. Then for the Legions, we renew the promise Of their rewards, which we decreed before, Should be performed when the war was finisht: But as for those which perisht in the battail, We will the Pensions were decreed for them Be (as 'tis just and requisite they should bee) Paid to their Parents, Brothers, Wives and children. Some of the Martiall Legion to our grief But their own glory fell with Victory. O happy death which being Natures due, Was for their countreys welfare suffer'd! you Borrow your glorious names from Mars, that hee Who for the Nations good did Rome decree, Might seem to have ordained you for Romes. Fame shall erect you MausolÃ¦an tombes: Death caught in flight is backt with infamy, Tis glorious to die with Victory; For in the fight Mars to oblige the rest, Is wont for pledges to select the best. Therefore those impious foes whom you have slain, In hell now suffer their deserved pain; But you who poured forth your latest spirit In sacred Victory, shall now inherit Those blessed fields where pious souls are sainted. What though your lives were short? they were untainted. And the blest memorie of your deaths shall climbe Beyond the confines of all-wasting time: Therefore most valiant while you liv'd, but now Most holy Soldiers it goes well with you, Your shining Vertues shall not clouded lie In the black dungeon of obscurity; Not your surviving kindred, but all Rome, Senate and People shall erect your tombe; There shall be built a stately monument With words ingraven, whose meaning shall present Your deeds unto Ãternity; that they Which see that frame, and read your acts, may say These were the men that lov'd their countreys good, And bought her freedome with their dearest bloud; And now for guerdon of their Loyalty Have seis'd a crown of Immortality. Exeunt omnes. A shout. Chorus. How wildly Fortune sports with Mortalls? now She shews a face as black as Night, Anon becalmes her stormy brow, And outvies Apollo's light. VVee float upon the surface of this Main, Now sinking into Scylla's jaws, Anon we check our fears again With hope and comforts milder laws. The worlds great Empresse, the blind Queen of Chance, A fairer pattern never drew Of her own unconstant glance, Then our Native Rome can stow. Alas! how did we whilome fear the wasle Done in the poor Brundusium? VVhen CÃ¦sar with maturer hast Strikes all those bleeding sorrows dumb. Then what a sad confus'd distraction late VVith horror did surprize our ears? How each heart did antedate A tempest in their troubled fears? VVhen on a sudden (mighty Jove be prais'd) The welcome news of Victory Seren'd those storms, and shouts are rais'd VVhich echo'd from th'harmonious sky. O may this fleeting fickle Goddesse here Securely softly sit her down, And sleep as long as PhÅbe's Deare On towring Latmus sacred crown. O that the wakefull Genius of this place VVould but present her with a potion From Lethe fetcht, might make her face Forget its frown, and feet their motion. Now Rome is Mars his darling Aphrodite; O that some Deity would set To take them in this happy plight A lasting Ademantine net! Listen Great Jove with what devotion sings The Voice of new-born libertie; O that some God would clip the wings Of unconstant Victory!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus tertius. Enter Antony in a morning gown; the haire of his head and beard very long and unkembed. Soldiers. An. Come fellow Sold. cheer your drooping spirits, Behold the campe of Lepidus. This weed Black as my Fortunes, these unkembed locks, This rusty long-grown beard, this meager visage, Emblems of my distresse, might make the bowells Of ravenous Wolves and Tygers yern with pity, But they are Romans, and have Roman hearts; Come, come, the day may shine, when with delight We shall recount the sorrows of this journey; When by our fires, in bosome of our wives, Our children too, and faithfull friends about us, We shall discourse unto their greedy ears Our travails through the Alps, and glory in them, How every weary step presented us With some new precipice; how we eas'd our limbes Not on the soft repose of downy beds, But on a frigid and congealed heap Of snowy fleeces, with some rugged crag To be our pillow. You shall then deride The Roman pomp, and when you see an ear Mung with a jewell, tell them 'twas not so With you, when whilome on the Alpine cliffs Your hairs were linkt with chains of dangling Isicle; What a brave glory will't be at a feast, Amongst th'abundance of the Roman luxury, To tell them how your welcome drink was once Not the sweet Nectar of the Lesbian grape, Or Formian wines presented in a cup Of Gold ingrav'n with Anticks, or in crystall Priz'd more for its fragility then worth? But, that which once Darius so esteem'd, The muddy water of a tainted puddle Scoopt with a hollow palm into your mouths; And that your Viands were not Lucrine oysters, The dainties of Cercei, or wild fowl Procur'd as far as from the River Phasis, But beasts whose stinking flesh would make the stomach Of your luxurious citizen disgorge, Roots, wild fruit, and the very barks of trees. Thus faithfull Partners of my travails shall wee Solace our selves, when these unwelcome clouds Are blown away. I'm now to throw the Dice, Pray heaven the chance be good; Retire you something. Exeunt Soldiers. Enter Soldiers as in Lepidus camp. 1 Sold. What discontented wight is this approaches Our trenches in this mournfull garb and habit? 2 Sold. By Mars he looks like a Memento mori. 3 Sold. Sure I have seen thy face. Ant. You have no doubt. And if my eyes deceive me not, I see Clodius and LÃ¦lius there among you, Two That would have known me once. Clod. It may bee so. LÃ¦l. But if we cannot call you now to mind, I hope you will impute it to your habit And our forgetfulnesse, but not to pride, Or scorn of misery. Ant. No I doe not LÃ¦lius. For I may well seem strange to thee, who am Grown almost out of knowledge with my selfe; Yet have I not forgot my Name, which while I was more happy was Antonius. Clod. Alas, I know you Sir to my grief. Ant. But now I will not arrogate that name, For being faln from what I was, I must not Make my self what I am. Alas I thought not, Then when Antonius was Antonius, Fortune would ere maligne me so as make me An eye-sore to my selfe. Brave Romans, here You see a wretch thrown from the height of greatnesse To feed on carrion, and, in fellowship Of Beasts, drink water out of tainted quagmires. Some remnants of my Army are surviving Which have with many a weary step past ore The rugged Alps, and here attend the sentence Of life or ruine from your Mouths. Omnes. Alas! Enter Lepidus. Lep. How's this? Antonius in a mourning habit Close at my Trenches, and with fawning words At parly with my Soldiers? Sound the trumpets, And drown this Syrens language, or w'are lost. Ex. Trumpets sound. Anton. I had but two poor Engines by whose help I thought the fortresse of these Souldiers hearts Might be subdued, my habit and my speech; And one's already frustrate, tis no matter. Though with this more then Corybantian noise My words are swallow'd, yet my miseries Shall speak as loud as thunder in the ears Of these relenting Romans, for I see Tokens of pity in their looks, well here Like a decayed statue will I stand And speak a mute Oration, that may chance Advance my hopes to th'height of wisht fruition. Enter Souldiers as in Lep. camp. 1 Sold. See where he stands. 2 Sold. Is that Antonius? 1 Sold. The same, or rather not the same Antonius. 3 Sold. 'Fore Jove 'tis pity, he's a proper man. 4 Sold. Me thinks he looks vile thin about the gills. 2 Sold. He stands by Heaven like a Mercuriall Index. 4 Sold. Ev'n such a meager face for all the world Has Saturnes statue in the Capitoll. Enter Clodius and LÃ¦lius in womens attire. 4 Sold. But stay, what's here, a brace of Cockatrices? Whither so fast, my pretty mincing Damsels? Wee must not part thus, Come, come. Clod. Say you so? VVith a box on the eare strikes him down Soldiers. Ha, ha, ha! 4 Sold. What female devill tro was't? by Jove My ear's as hot as limping Vulcans anvill. Souldiers. Ha, ha! Exeunt. Clod. Now, Noble Antony, I see wee are As much unknown to you in this disguise, As you to us, when first you did appear So far unlike our late renowned Consul; But Sir to put you out of doubt I'm Clodius. LÃ¦l. And I am LÃ¦lius. Clod. Both come to recomfort Your wretched fortunes. Ant. Friends I can but thanke you. LÃ¦l. 'Tis more then wee deserve yet. Ant. 'Tis as much. As my forlorn estate can now afford. LÃ¦l. Your state's forlorn no longer then you please, Take heart, the camp is ready to receive you. Clod. I, and to kill the Generall Lepidus If you'l but say the word. Ant. Again I thank you, And will not die a debter; nay I must Die both a debter, and ungratefull too. The courtesie's so great, my best endeavours Will bee too feeble ever to requite it. Yet shall the Generall Lepidus live for mee, I will not raise my fortunes by his fall. Clod. Then Sir to morrow morning shall our campe Expect you with your Soldiers, and the Trench Bee levell'd 'gainst your coming. Ant. Clodius, And LÃ¦lius the restorers of my life, I were a foe to my own happinesse, And which is more, respectlesse of your kindnesse, If I should fail. Clod. Then Antony till then Farewell. Ant. Farewell, farewell good LÃ¦lius. Ex. Clod. &amp; LÃ¦l. Why now me thinks I'm Antony again; I gratulate my Alpine travails now. Who in a state so hopelesse as was mine Would not for such an issue feed on dogs, Or cats, or worse then both an age together? Well I'l unto my fellow travailers, This news will make them frolick. Thus the day Usher'd with darknesse sends the sweeter ray. Exit. Enter CÃ¦sar. Now CÃ¦sar summon thy whole self, thou art But yet a stripling, and must arm thy self With providence unknown in these few years. The Senators, those Nestors of the State, Disturb the fair prÃ¦ludium of my Glories: They have created Decimus their Generall Against Antonius, robb'd me of my Triumph, And jealous of my fortunes, closely practise To win the Soldiers from me, but I am not So weak a Politician, on such termes To part with these fair hopes: if this contempt Be cast upon me, Antony yet living, What would they doe if he were once extinguisht? Well I'l no longer be deluded thus. I'l doe what Pansa on his Death-bed wisht nie; Even this, acquaint my self with Antony, And Lepidus, to whom no doubt he is join'd. Then will I send Centurions to the Senate, To ask for me in name of the whole Army The Consulship. If't be denyed, I am determin'd To march my selfe to Rome, and gain by force What fair means cannot win. They who intend Betimes to compasse their wisht journeys end Must take the day before 'em; so must I, Set forth at morning of my age, and ply My youthfull sinews in this task of glory, Crowning my spring with harvest, that the story Of CÃ¦sars forward years, may be as bright As others lives, and send as fair a light. Exit. Enter M. Cicero, and his brother Quint. Mar. Brother, I'm much perplext about this CÃ¦sar, He has so fixt his hopes upon the Consulship Ther's no removing him. Quint. I alwaies fear'd, What the Immoderate Honors which the Senate Confer'd upon him would at length produce. For if Antonius from deceased CÃ¦sar, Took his occasion to usurp the State; What hope, may we suppose, will he put on The Author of whose confidence is not A murdred Tyrant, but the Senates self? And truly brother you are to be blam'd For the same flux of Honors with the rest. Mar. Why Quintus, he deserved them and more While he stood constant to his countreys cause; As for my self, the dignity which I Decreed him, was but just and necessary; For you well know the name of Generall, Though it was somewhat too much for his age, Is not convenient only, but essentiall To the well governing of so great an Army. Now since Octavius has abus'd both that And other favours, 'tis his own ambition And not my fault, unlesse I must be censur'd As guilty of another misdemeanours. Quint. You must, if you might have prevented it, Which moderation would have done. But now That CÃ¦sar who (as you were wont to say) Flow'd from the fountain of your Counsells, sullies All your intendments; for alas what good, What profit gain we by the overthrow Of Antony, since for reward Octavius Requires succession in his Tyranny? Since he who vindicated one, begins Himself another ill, as black as that, And like to take a deeper root and footing? Mar. Nay, prethy Quintus, doe not aggravate. The youth I hope is not so lost to goodnesse, So desperately given, but I may win him To have some pity on the State, to tender The safeties of well-minded Citizens, Especially of my beloved Brutus. Quint. What if he will not? shall we not be safe But under his protection? Heaven defend us, What would the noble Brutus say of this, Should he but hear it, doe you think hee'd brook His Safety should be so demissely begg'd Of him that's heir to Julius, whom he slew? Why now you put the reins of Tyranny Into his hand, and indiscreetly kindle The fire already glowing in his brest. Hee'l raise his thoughts to fancy certainties, And hasten to maturity what yet Is scarce conceiv'd in th'womb of his Ambition; When he perceives the authors of our liberty Commended to his care, and that by you Who have been hitherto the chiefest prop And pillar of it. Why consider Mark The very name of CÃ¦sar seems t'encite him 'Gainst those which flew his Unkle. Mar. Cease Good Quintus, You wrack me too severely. Enter Tyro. Tyro. My Good Lord, The Centiner Cornelius, from the Generall Octavius CÃ¦sar waits to speak with you. Mar. He must be mildly handled. Quint. As you please. Mar. Well, bring him in. Exit Tyro. Enter again Tyro with Cornelius. Corn. The Generall Octavius Salutes your Lordship not by me alone But by these Letters. Delivers and Cic. reads. Sir I must intreat you In name of the whole Army to repair To th'Senate. Cic. Yes Cornelius I will, And glad I am to hear the noble CÃ¦sar Is in good health. Corn. Farewell my Lord. Cic. Farewell. Exit Cornelius. Marc. Brother here's that I fear'd so much, there are Four hundred Soldiers in the Armies name Come to intreat for him the Consulship. 'Tis CÃ¦sars own device I fear, although He makes it not his, but the Armies suit. What's your advice? Quint. Why are you doubtfull brother? Ne'r give your voice, lest what you have atchiev'd Against Antonius now degenerate From the fair glory of a valiant mind, To an opinion of slavish fear; Nay worse, 'twill occasion to the world To brand you with hypocrisie, and say Your deeds have tended not to root our Tyranny, But rather to obtain a milder Master. You know the times; a Magistrate is made, Doe what he can, the common mark of slander; The best State-pilots oft are overwhelm'd With the foul sea of an opprobrious mouth; Their Vertues branded with the name of Vice, Their diligence of deceit; but to consent To this Ambitious suit for CÃ¦sar, were T'expose your self to a deserved censure And such a one would taint your worthiest actions. Exeunt. Manet Tyro. Takes out a Table-book, and writes, Cal. Sex. An. ab urb. cond. D. CC. XX. Cornelius with other Centurions and Souldiers, to the number of 400 came in the behalf of the whole army to Rome, to ask of the Senate the Office of Consull for their Generall Octavius CÃ¦sar. Now, as it is the custome of Historians, Let me a little descant on this businesse. There is a whispring rumour, that Octavius. Slew Hirtius in the tumult of the battle, And poyson'd Pansa at Bononia, By his Physitian Glyco; now me thinks, This sudden suit for th'Consulship confirms, At least makes more suspitious that report. Nay more, I hear he's reconcil'd to Antony. Upon a sudden; this is something too. I know not what will follow; but 'tis doubtfull. So, how I care not, if I goe and read Two or three pages of that liquid volume Commended to me by my Cousen Laureas. Enter Senate, Cornelius and Centurions. Cornel. My Lords the Senators, we here are come, To ask for CÃ¦sar our victorious Generall, In the behalfe and name of the whole Army, The Office of the Consul, and expect Your present answers to our just request. We hope his Age will be no greater barre To him, then it has been before to others, Cervinus was but yet a youth, and Scipio No more, when they were both created Consulls, And yet the State repented them of neither. We might produce the examples of great Pompey And Dolabella, but we hope 'tis needlesse. Cent. Cornelius speaks the language of us all. Cor. And the whole Army, Fathers, speaks in us. Cic. What is your counsell Conscripts? 1 Sen. Marcus Tullius Our Liberty's at stake in my opinion. And would be ruin'd should we grant the suit. 2 Sen. 'Tis palpable. 3 Sen. We must not give such reins To this Ambitious Youth. 4 Sen. I know not one In all our Order will consent unto it. 5 Sen. The Tribunes are against it. Cic. Salvius too? 5 Sen. I, he especially. 6 Sen. And I. All. And All. Cic. Inform him good Minutius. Min. The Senators doe all intreat the Army To be a while contented with the honors Already heaped on your Generall, The worthy CÃ¦sar, and the States preserver. When they shall judge it timely and convenient He shall, I know't Cornelius, have both this, And other dignities with a full hand. While others rule, yet those that doe obey Are no lesse part o'th'Common-wealth then they. Cor. Minutius you may keep your sentences, For they nor your fair language shall perswade us To leave the prosecution of our suit. It seems the Conscript Fathers are against it; But this shall doe it, if the Senate Will not. shews them the pommell of his sword. Minut. Hence traitrous varlet dost thou threaten us? Exeunt Cornel. &amp; Cent. 1 Sen. How's this? 2 Sen. So boistrous? then I fear a storm. Cic. A strange affront. Min. What heavy Tyranny Must we expect from CÃ¦sars Consulship Whose agents dare thus check this sacred Order? Exeunt. Enter Pomponia, Philologus. Pomp. What is the Senate yet broke up Philologus? Phil. Yes, newly Madam. Pomp. Where's my Husband Quintus? Phil. Gone but t'accompany my Lord your Brother Home to his house, he will be with you straight, For so he bad me tell you. Pomp. 'Tis enough. Exit Phil. Why what a peece of idle Vanity, Is Woman to be so inquisitive? My ear now itches, till I hear th'affairs Debated in the Senate.âI have read A very prety fiction now I think on't; How the first mover, being, cause, or Nature, Or Fate or Fortune, call him what you will, When he first fram'd the fondling sexe of Women In his Promethean shop, did form the Heart, The Mind, the Soul, or whatsoere you call That inner Pilot of this floating Clay, Of strange and various matters, whence they did Derive their as strange qualities and conditions: A slut was formed of as foul a sow; A subtil Huswife of a crafty fox; A gluttonous and lazy Crone of earth; A woman turning like a weathercock, With the fond wind of crosse and foolish humours, Smiling and frowning oft-times in an houre, As false as winter sun-shine or a showre In summer, was composed of the Ocean. And so of all the rest, but she whose ears Tingle as mine with this inquisitive itch, Had, as the Fable fancies, for her Sire A dog; but yet me thinks I cannot find My selfe in all this brood; for though I have A fond desire to hear, yet say I little, I bark not, mine's a harmlesse folly which Is never like to change me to a bitch As't did the Trojan Hecuba. Exit. Enter Piso and Fulvia. Pi. Come, Fulvia, cease these sorrows, for thy husband Has now shook off the chains that kept him down, The frozen Alps have brought him to a Fortune Which may weigh down the thought of past afflictions; He's fellow Generall with Lepidus, Nay, he alone rules all, and Lepidus Has but the naked name and title only; And now they have repast the Alps together, With seventeen Legions, as I am inform'd, Besides ten thousand Hors-men; nay Octavius And he are now for ever reconcil'd; Here's that will adde Authority to my words. Delivers a Letter. She reads. Fulv. Octavius is our own; confirm'd, confirm'd. By a more naturall tie then Friendship. Piso. How! Fulv. He must now call me Mother; for the daughter Of Fulvia is decreed his Spouse. Piso. indeed! Fulv. I, and Octavius too has past the Rubicon, And is now marching hither with 8 Legions. So Cicero I think has lost his shelter. Now shall my Husband Antony, and I Be for his stabbing jeers at length reveng'd. Piso I thank you, all my cares are vanisht. Exit. Piso. This woman's now secure, but I have eyes Which stay not at the Superficies, But pierce to th'center and the heart of things. I am afraid this friendship is not reall, And but to compasse his own ends. He creeps Into acquaintance with Antonius, That by his aid I doubt himself may win A good successe to his Ambitious aymes; As first to seat himself in th'Consulship, Next to root out the Macedonian Chiefs Brutus and Cassius; but will this bee all? Will he sit still and on this height determine To fix the pillar of his hopes? No, no, Ambition cannot brook Plurality. Only one Neptune in the Sea doth dwell, One Jove in Heaven, and but one Dis in Hell: Heaven, Hell, and raging Sea have each but one, And He or Antony must rule alone. Ex. Enter Salvius, Cicero. Salv. Alas good Cicero, 'twas not hate to you Nor love unto Antonius that I did it, But pure devotion to my Countreys cause. Cic. But my immoderate hate of Antony (I now confesse it) blinded my discretion, And carried me too inconsiderately Unto this dangerous planting of Octavius. Salv. 'Twas that I fear'd, and therefore did withstand you. You favour'd CÃ¦sar, and maintain'd his youth In opposition of Antonius, Lest Antony should get the upper hand; I favour'd Antony, and oppos'd your counsells, Lest CÃ¦sar should ascend too high a pitch; Your aim was to beat down a reigning Tyranny, Mine to keep down springing Ambition; Yours to oppresse Antonius culminant, Mine to suppresse rising Octavius; both Good in th'intent, though in effect pernicious. Cicer. Sure some superiour power has order'd this, And made us instruments of our own subversion; But this afflicts me most, that these calamities Should happen at a season so unfortunate, When Brute and Cassius are so far remote, Nor furnisht neither to oppose such violence, Enter Apuleius. You look, good Tribune, as if horrour dwelt Upon your browes; what tydings Apuleius? Apul. My Lord Octavius is directly coming To th'City with an Army of 8 Legions; Antonius too and Lepidus are come With mighty forces into Italy Only with this intent, to second CÃ¦sar; The streets are fill'd with tumult and confusion Some run about not knowing what to doe, Others remove their families and goods Into out-villages, or stronger places Within this City. Salv. Heaven defend us, Cicero, Alas we are undone. Apul. The Senate, Sir, Is now in consultation of some course Whereon to pitch. Your presence is expected. Cic. No doubt it is; but Ile absent my selfe, The Conscript Fathers may themselves determine What's best in this necessitating straight For their own safeties, I should say the States, But there the choise is crost; as for my self Nothing can come amisse. I'v liv'd too long To see this day. The Fathers forc't to yeeld (As now they must) to th'ruine of their liberty: O 'tis a corrosive to my soul to think on't. Twere good you two would goe and take your place. Both. We will, and that with speed; Farewell. Cic. Farewell. Ex. Enter Senate. 1 Sen. Wee must bee speedy Fathers. What's counsells? 2 Sen. Twere best in my opinion to dispatch A message to him to present him with The Consulship. 3 Sen. I, that's the safest way. 4 Sen. But th'Armies fired for the late repulse How shall we stay their furies? 2 Sen. Wee'l decree To th'whole 8 Legions twice so much in As wee have promis'd to the two. 1 Sen. How say you? Are you content? Omnes. Content! we must of force. 1 Sen. See what the Tribunes say to't. Sen. They consent, Forc't by the same necessity as wee. 1 Sen. Come then, let's speedily dispatch the Legats. Exeunt. Enter Cicero. Cic. How will this royall City now become A nest of Vultures! and her Senatours Be made a wretched prey to rav'nous talons! Will CÃ¦sar think himself secure, while men So much addicted to the State survive? No; Tyranny's suspicious, hee'l unhead them, Lest happily they should beget young Brutes. Enter Salvius. Salvius what news? Salv. What news! why CÃ¦sar's Consul. Legates are sent unto him with the offer. Cic. Heavens! what a tide of woes must Rome expect, When she must lift the axe to her own head? That Brutus were at home now! we would loose Our dearest bloud, before our liberty. Thrice happy you, which in the Mutine field Gave up your lives! you breath not with the rest, To taint your former glories with black treason To your own Countreys freedome; in soft peace Rest your immortall souls. But wretched we, That for one Tyrant, now are plagu'd with three. Enter Qu. Cicero. Quint. Brother, the Africk Legions are arriv'd. Mar. Arrived Quintus? Quin. Marcus 'tis most certaine. Marc. Nay, then we will not on such feeble terms Part with our Countreys freedome, Salvius come. Exeunt. Enter Senators. Senator. What have we done my Lords? given up our liberty, Without the shedding of one drop of bloud? Twill grow a custome for Ambitious men T'usurp the offices of State, if thus The Consulship be made a prey to force; Nay rather let's oppose and bear th'assault, Till Decimus or Plancus come and succour us. Let's fight till our lifes latest breath be spent, Rather then leave a gap for Tyranny, Never before attempted with successe. There was, there was that virtue once in Rome, When her brave Worthies would not stand agast: At such a threatned storm as this, but strike The bolt from hand of that usurping Jove Durst venture once to raise it. Conscripts, what Have we let dull and rust the glorious edge Of that heroick boldnesse? or is't only Imprison'd in the sheath? let's draw it out: Nor faile our Countrey, but uphold her cause, While we have hearts, and hands, like true-born Romans. Enter Cicero. Cicer. Fathers you were too forward inth'dispatch Of your Legation to Octavius. You will repent it. 1 Sen. M. Tullius, why? Cic. The Africk Legions are arriv'd. Sen. Arriv'd! Then let the Messengers be called back. Ex. Cic. Fathers, I need not urge how bright and glorious Is zeal unto the common cause. I know You prize it as the jewell of your lives, And you doe well; for 'tis a Musick which Will, like the note of the Caystrian bird, Stick by you till your latest gasp; and then Be your good Genius mounting to the skies Your winged souls, where being stellifi'd You shall with shining Opticks see how weak A nothing is, this molehill earth whereon Poor Mortalls toil so; there you shall behold How feeble, how ridiculous a madnesse Is fond Ambition. But I lose my self In this divine and pleasing contemplation, Come let's dispose our selves for opposition. Senators. With all our Hearts. Heaven prosper the attempt. Exeunt. Enter CÃ¦sar, Captains, Soldiers. CÃ¦s. How's this? the Senate so unconstant? well. Cornelius take some certain Horsemen with you, Post to the City, and assure the people, I come not with intent to raise a tumult, But on faire terms of peace; make hast before, And I will follow with all speed I can. Exit. Enter Pomponia and Young Quintus. Pomp. So studious Quintus in such times as these? Quint. Yes, Madam, therefore 'cause the times are such Though CÃ¦sar be a youth as well as I, Yet he is one of deeper undertakings Then can be sounded by such heads as mine; Pray heav'n they puzzle not the piercing judgments Of our grave Senators. Pomp. And 'tis my prayer, But what is't you are reading? Quint. 'Tis a book My Unkle Marcus wisht me to peruse. Pom. You cannot better spend your mornings leisure Then after his prÃ¦scriptions. Time's a treasure. âA day is like a costly ring of Gold, âAnd morning is the Diamond of that ring. But tell me something which your book containes Worthy our hearing. Quint. Madam, the whole volume Is like a gallery hung about with pictures Of filiall piety. Here on trembling shoulders More fam'd then those of Hercules, which upheld The heavenly orbes, one bears his aged father Through midst of flames, and so conserves that being Which was the Spring of his. Another bears Her on his pious back who in her wombe Bare him. Here one sustains her mothers life With the same food wherewith her own first breath Was by that mother cherisht; these were deities In Natures heaven, and have now an Elysium Not to inhabit only but to rule. Yet that which makes me most admire, is this, That the mute son of CrÅsus should unlose The fetters tyed by Nature to his tongue, And cry, Kill not the King. Pomp. To save our Parents Is the first law and dictate Nature writes In our hearts fleshy Tables, therefore did she Articulate the undistinguisht murmurings Of his chain'd tongue, left by her fault that law Should vent its force and vigour in the youth. Quint. Methinks I envy the example. Pomp. What? Would you your father should be so indanger'd That you might save him? Quint. No, not for a world. But who knows what this age doth travail with? Pomp. True, But the President coheres not; You, The heavens be thank'd for't, were not born dumb. Quint. Tis a great benefit; but yet me thinks I could incarcerate, as he freed his voice, To save a father. I could win by bridling As great a name, as he by giving reins To stupid nature; such an act would come Within the verge of praise, whereas his does not Without th'internalls. Pomp. Goe, you make me sad. Exit Quintus. What Genius has inform'd my Quintus fancy, That he still meditates on such examples? Pray heaven my husband never prove an object For him whereon to exercise this piety. Exit. Enter M. Cicero. Still doe I strive against the stream, and like A silly Lark mount the inraged wind, Which i I doe not poise my actions well Will carry me away. We thought the Gods By their auspicious providence had sent The Africk Legions to our succour; but They are revolted from us, and their Captains Taken to favour. Only one Cornutius Scorning to beg life from this second CÃ¦sar Has like a second Cato slain himself. And I would follow him, but that the good And safety of my Countrey is my Remora. I will for th'present seek Octavius favour, It cannot be a stain to Cicero Since all have don't already but my self. Enter Senators. Sen. Have you made peace wth CÃ¦sar? Cic. I have sued it By mediation of his friends, and now Wait to accost him, sure he is at hand. Sen. He is indeed; Hark how the people shout. Shout. Enter CÃ¦sar and others. Sen. Health to the worthy and victorious Consul. CÃ¦sar. Fathers I thank you. Cicer. Haile to Noble CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. My Honor'd Father! Cic. Tis too high a Title For M. Tullius Cicero. CÃ¦s. Now you wrong me, The Parent of my country must be mine. But yet I must be bold to tell you Sir, You have been something sparing of your courtesies; You are the last of all my Noble friends That come to wellcome my return from Gaule. Exeunt. A shout. Chorus. O what awoundiug shout was this! Tis even as banefull as the Mandrakes note, The shrieks of damned souls, the hisse Of Scorpions, Adders, or the Sirens throte. Let it be strangled, 'tis a sound Will wake pale death from his Cimmerian Cell, Twill rend a passage through the ground, And bring the Furies from their Court of Hell: The barbarous Thracians though they sing Their dead unto their graves, would howle to see So black, so venemous a sting Enter the body of their State, as we. For these are but Sardonian smiles Which dance upon our browes; this fading mirth Will prove an Embryon, and beguile's When wee shall find it still-borne at the birth. O what a golden age w'enjoy'd Under the Reverend Saturnes of the State! But now an upstart scarce unboyd, Unto an age of iron gives new date. What power this ruine on us slings? Julius is turn'd his Genius, we fear, And lent him Tityus Vultures wings T'enhaunce the swiftnesse of his proud careere If such a little time as scant Full twenty Summers have a Consul bore Of such a growth, so culminant; What may we think alas of twenty more? Others when in this sacred way Of honor, they had travail'd but so far, Would sit them down, and sagely say, Death was mature unto a Consular. But this young Minion of blind chance, Like a skie-climbing Eagle still will tower Untill he shall himself advance Unto a Sov'raign Independent power. Heavens! if it be your sacred pleasure To put a period to our Tibertie, O let the Scepter know some measure, That being servile we may yet seem free.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. M. T. Cicero. Now we are past recovery, lost for ever. Our new-made Consul, made indeed, but not Elected, for Election is an Act Of Will not Voice, of an internall suffrage, Not outward sound; this Consul, whom our fears, Not our Consents or Votes have dignified, Hangs o're us like a full and pregnant cloud Ready to pour a tempest on our heads. Our forced hands delivered him the Axe To punish State-maligners, but alas He whets it for the necks of our preservers. I, only I am blam'd: ungratefull City; They are not CÃ¦sars honors which afflict us, But his new-entered friendship with Antonius, Which was the only rock my best endeavours Were ever prest t'avoid, lest the Republike Should suffer wrack upon't. I thought the way To keep him distant with Antonius, Was to advance him to a requisite power Of opposition: 'las we but conjecture And guesse at the events of things; our knowledg Cannot arrive to an infallible certainty Of the successe of matters; 'tis a priviledge Peculiar only to the Gods, and is Deriv'd to us, weak mortalls, not by nature, But extraordinary participation. Since therefore 'tis th'unknown event alone, Not the perversnesse of my soul, which crosses The seeming good appearing in my counsells, Why am I made the mark of accusation? But tis the custome of the times, I will not Deject my self for this; the innocence Which I am arm'd with is enough to raise me From such servility, but yet I'm griev'd For the sure ruine of my countreys freedome, For my Dear Brutus, and the Noble Cassius. The other Consul Quintus Pedius Has publisht a decree wherein they're sentenc'd With interdiction of Fire and Water. Of Fire and Water! can they then constrain The fountains of our eyes to cease their course? Brutus shall have these waters, till we have wept Their currents dry; and then our hearts shall send Whole clouds of vapouring sighs to feed new showrs. But as for fire, they want it not; their brests Cherish the flame of an unmoved zeal Unto their countreys liberty, which cannot Be quencht but with their blood; this CÃ¦sar knows, And therefore that he may with doubled power Oppresse the heroick bravery of their spirits, Has reconcil'd Antonius and Lepidus, Those two pernicious monsters with the Senate, And now he is return'd again toward Mutine, No doubt to join with those two plagues, and there Contrive the ruine of the Common-wealth. For State- usurpers think of nought but blood, When they consult tis to devour the good. Enter Q. Cicero. Quint. Brother, How dost? Mar. Thinkst my beloved Quintus I can be healthfull when the State's diseas'd Whereof I am a Member? Quint. 'Las tis true, Too true; the Common-wealth's diseas'd indeed, Sick at the heart, faints, can no longer stand, Lies bedrid, and like fierce Procrustes guests Must be distended or abbreviated To th'pleasure of her Lord the worst of theeves; For CÃ¦sar, Antony, and Lepidus, Are met together not far off from Mutine, And in an Island round environed With a smal river, without any company, Are as I hear consulting. Marc. What a Hell Will this poor City be, when such a Three, Like Minos, Ãacus, and Rhadamanth, Sit on the life and death of her best States-men? Quint. Tis to be fear'd indeed they will play Sylla's. But who can help it? if the Gods will throw Destruction on us, we must not complain, For they're above us, and it were but vain, For who can alter the decrees of fate? Alas we are but mortall, and the State Of this lifes pilgrimage is full of woe, Better die once delivered with one blow, And in ones countreys cause, then living dy Wounded with sight of bloody Tyranny. Marc. Now Quintus speakes like his own virtuous self, This language melts me into fire and aire; I am sublim'd, and ready to take flight In extasie from this unwieldy lump; Come, let's retire into my garden; there Proceed in this divine discourse, 'twill make My soul disdaine with Earthly mould comply, And raise her thoughts to immortality. Exeunt. Enter CÃ¦sar Solus. How full of fate and horrour is this morning? She comes not tripping on the mountains tops, But moves with drooping pace, and leaden heels, Her eye-lids are not rosy, nor her brow Gilded with that sweet beauty it was wont; What has she changed colours with her Memnon? Or is she sick, and so has bound her head, In this black vail of clouds? Alas, alas, Tis lest her eyes behold our blacker deeds. My self, Antonius, and Lepidus Have, like the three Saturnian brothers once, Amongst us shar'd the Roman world, as if It were our own inheritance, and now We must complot a Tragedy; the Proscripts Must be culled out; shall Cicero then dy? Alas, how piety struggles in my brest. This mouth, this tongue which now must speak his death, Was wont to call him Father; shall I then Become a Paricide? Suppose I doe; He that aspires to govern without check, Must set his foot upon his fathers neck. It is a maxime long since practised By Jove himself upon his father Saturne. But words oblige not to a naturall duty. I did but call him Father; and if now I yeeld consent unto his death, I doe it As he is Marcus Cicero, a stranger To CÃ¦sars blood. But Cato thought him worthy The honor'd title of his Countreys Parent. And shall Octavius ruine so great worth? Be still my melting passions: He must die, And therefore 'cause he is his Countreys parent, He that is CÃ¦sars friend must be a foe Unto his countreys freedome, which he prizes Above his life, and for this cause must lose it. Shall he then die? Ambition sayes he must. But piety forbids; but Piety Must not be sided with Ambition. It must be so. Antonius shall have Cicero, Antonius then shall give me Lucius CÃ¦sar, And Lepidus shall yeeld his brother Paulus. Ambition thus must thought of pity smother Even toward a Father, Unkle, or a Brother. Exit. Enter Laureas. Heavens! What a dismall time is this? the dogs As if they were transformed into wolves, Gather together, and doe nought but howle; And wolves as if they were changed into dogs, Have left the woods and traverse through the streets. A Bull was heard send forth a humane voice, An infant newly born to speak; A showre Of stones descended from the troubled skies; And in the aire was heard the cries of men, Clashing of armour, and a noise of Horses, Shrill trumpets sounds; the statues of the Gods Swet drops of bloud, and some were toucht from heaven, Many of th'Temples too are Thunder struck. Enter Tyro. Tyro were ever known such Tragedies? Tyro. Never was imminent calamity Threatened to Rome, but 'twas thus ushered, Laureas. I might alledge the wretched fall of Crassus, When such a purple floud of Roman gore Discoloured Lucans field. But the not yet cur'd dire Pharsalian blow Shall speak for all. Rome scarce ere knew a prodigie Which was not prÃ¦vious to that bloudy day, The Sun and Moon eclipst, Ãtnean flames Obliquely darted on th'Italian shore, The Vestall fire extinct, the Native gods Weeping; State-changing comets, monstrous births, The grones of Ghosts from out their troubled Vrnes, With many more. Laur. But the Hetruscian Soothsayers Will descant better on these things then we. Tyro. 'Slight thou saist true, and now I think on't La. Wee'l try if we can search what they determine, Sure they have done by this their immolations. Exeunt. Enter Senate and Soothsayers. Cicero. You the most Reverend of Hetruscian Vates, To whom is known the births and deaths of States, You who by art unlock the Pole, to whom Is made apparent fates intended doom By entrails deep inspection, or by thunder, A hairy star or some such boding wonder, Inform us what the angry destinies, Threaten in these portentous prodigies, But be not Ãnigmaticall, nor shroud Your Speeches in a dark mysterious cloud, As did the Sibylls and the Delphick Nun, Let your inspired Numbers evenly run With obvious and unfolded sense, that so We may conceive the essence of our woe. The Ancientest of the Soothsayers. Then fathers, hear your dismall fate, Your freedome shall be lost, your state Converted to a Monarchy, And all be slaves but only I Sen. What means the Aged Prophet? Stops his breath, and falls down dead. Cicer. Fallen down? Is it some powerfull extasie or death? Second Soothsayer. Our brother from his clay is flowne, And seal'd your destiny with his own. Thrice happy he, that now is blest With a true Elysian rest, And shall not see the tide of woe Which on Survivers heads will flow. The third. Like our brothers Vitall thread Who now lies before us dead, Your twine of liberty is broke, And Romans must expect the yoke. The fourth. What the destinies have made A firm decree, and he hath said, No humane power can disanull, Tis signed in your speaking bull. The fift. When Romulus first founded Rome, He fixt his Crowne by Remus doome, And built his Monarchy in bloud; Now shall return that antique power Not re-establisht with a shower Of that salt humour, but a floud. Cic. Well, what the fates have destin'd, humane power Is not of strength to cancell; if I dye, (As sure my bloud must help to make the stream) I will dye willingly; 'tis a noble death Not to survive ones countreys liberty: If Gods might tast of death, then would they die. The Soothsayers over the dead corpes sing this Song. 1 Brother, 2 Brother, 3 Brother, 4 Brother, 1. Art thou dead? 2. Art thou fled? 3. Art thou gone, 4. All alone? 1. To the shades below, 2. To the desert cells, 3. Where glooing darknesse dwells, 4. And cloudy woe; 1. Where ne'r was knowne; 2. A cheerfull tone, 3. Where wretched Souls 4. Like Stygian owles, Together. Have no joy of one another? 1 Brother, 2 Brother, 3 Brother, 4 Brother. 1. Thou art dead; 2. Thou art fled, 3. Thou art gone 4. All alone, 1. To the groves below, 2. Where sacred Quires 3. Inspir'd with holy fires 4. In triumph goe, 1. Where songs of mirth 2. Are caroll'd forth, 3. Where blessed Souls, 4. In Nectar bowles, Together. Drink and solace one another. Exeunt with the carkasse. Enter Cicero reading. O Vitam vere vitalem! sed beatam etiam mortem, alla a be atissimam vitam aditum aperiat! Most true, for did we like savage beasts Returning to a former aiery being, No one part of us free from dissolution, Death were a plague, and did not harbour in it The sweetnesse which they talk of; for I think To be, is better, though in restlesse troubles, Then not to be at all; 'twere senselesse, impious To say the power that's President of Nature, Infus'd into us such a love of Union In this compounded frame; without some blessing In the continuance; but a meer cessation, A sinking into nothing, though it pains not, Yet 'tis no blessing, nor can properly Be said to take our cares and sorrows from us, Or us from them, but rather and more truly Us from our selves. I cannot think the Gods Were so unkind, so sparing of their blessings, Or feebly stor'd, as to bestow a Nothing On the two pious sons of Argia, On Agamedes and Trophonius; For, pray, what goodnesse can be coucht in that Which cancells being, that is one with goodnesse? But doe we live then? can I think the soul Survives, when in an urnes forgetfull chest The mournfull treasure of our Ashes rest? See how my panting struggling soul contends To harbour the belief! Alas, me thinks Tis no small argument to ground our hopes on, To see how sweetly good men entertain The weakest motion for a future life; To see them, how even shaking hands with death, They are more sprightly and repleat with vigour, Yea oftentimes oraculous, as if Something lay cag'd within that was not mortall, But were new-rapt with joy of better state, And even then seizing on Divinitie, When wicked men are full of discontents; Tortur'd with furies, which their consciences Present them in the ugliest shapes: is't fancy? Or is't a feare their sullyed names will stink In th'nostrills of posterity? 'tis neither. For if the first; why then are not the good Subject to th'same commotions, whose diseases And bodily distempers are the same? But if the second; then might they be free To whose enormous actions darknesse only And secret Angels have been conscious; Therefore by this it seems that Tityus vultur, Ixions wheel, and the Tantalian fruits Are not meer bug-bears; but some mystick Emblemes Of the succeeding pains of guilty souls. Thus have I argued, yea and partly satisfied My own weak reason. Yet our great Philosophers In the discussing of this weighty matter, Fare much like naked men in stony fields, They can with ease beat down anothers reasons, But cannot save their own, alas, from falling; They can offend a wise Antagonist Weaken his grounds, but not defend themselves. Whither, alas, shall our endeavours tend, When we are blind in knowledg of our end? Enter Laureas. Laur. My Lord, there's one without would speak with you From the Triumvirs. Cic. The Triumvirs Laureas? Laur. Yes, so he sayes. Cic. O from Antonius, CÃ¦sar and Lepidus. Send for Quint. to me, For Salvius, Otho, Publius Apuleius, And other of my friends, you know. Lau. I fly. Cic. But charge none enter till they hear from me. From the Triumvirs? have they then usurpt Ex. Lau. A new-coyn'd office? what will now become Of those that have the old ones? what! why have Their Reverend heads struck off like Tarquins poppie. Enter Quintus Cicero. Marc. Brother, how is it you are here so soon, Since 'tis but now I sent to intreat your company? Quint. A Brother should not stay till he be sent for, When he suspects his presence will be usefull; I had some doubtfull notice of this messenger Which now within waits for admittance. Mar. Quintus, How I am blest in such a carefull brother! Thus when the Argive King was vext with doubts, And call'd a councell of the GrÃ¦cian Peers, Only his brother Menelaus came. Of his own free accord. Quint. It should be so, Why had we else one father, why one mother, If not to live like brothers? Mar. True, good Quintus, I could even weep to see this piety Flow so divinely from thee, now if ever Our states require our mutuall aids and counsells. But what dost think this messenger may bring? Quint. No good I warrant you, perhaps our deaths. Can we expect from those three Roman furies A milder sentence? Mar. Why, I will embrace it. Father and Ruler of the lofty sky, What way thou pleasest lead, and grant that I May follow with no sad or grieved blood, Nor like an ill man bear what fits a good. Enter Salvius, Apuleius, and other friends of Cicero. Mar. Friends, you are welcome. You shall hear anon Why you were sent for. Now call in the Messenger. Enter Messenger. Mess. I cannot, Sir, say Health unto your Lordship, Untill your self confirm it, which you may As will appear by this, (Delivers a Letter.) Nay good my Lord, Give these the hearing of it, for the affair May crave their judgments. Mar. Then you know it. Mess. Partly. Mar. Read you it Quintus. Quint. No, my mouth shall never Speak my own Brothers sentence, Marc. This is fond. Quint. Pray heaven it prove so. Marc. Will you read it Salvius? Salv. You must excuse me Cicero. Cic. Say you so? Then Apuleius you must be the Man. Apul. Sir, by no means, if your own brother dare not; Pray pardon me. Cic. Indeed! then read it you. 1 Friend. Not I my Lord, 2 Nor I, 3 Nor I, 4 Nor I. Marc. Then Marcus Tullius sit thee down and read, No doubt, thine own proscription. Omnes. Heavens defend! (Cic. Reads.) M. Antonius Imperator, Augur, Triumvir, to M. Tullius Cicero, Consular, Greeting. Wee the Triumviri M. Antonius, M. Lepidus, and Octavius CÃ¦sar (Ventidius being chosen Consul in his roome) Mar. Ventidius Consul in Octavius room, And he Triumvir? this afflicts my soul. (Reads.) Cic. are for the space of five whole yeers appointed with full and absolute authority for the re-establishment of the Common-wealth; and you Cicero are now in my hands; yet have I so mitigated my just conceived indignation toward you, that if you will but burn your Orations which you call your Philippicks, compiled only out of malice and rancour against me, you shall live; otherwiseâ Yours, if perversnesse make you not your own foe. Mar. You shall be soon informed which way I am resolv'd to take. Mess. Ile waite your Lordships pleasure. Exit. Mar. Friends, here you see the slender twine whereon My aged life depends. Salv. Too true my Lord. Marc. Your counsell brother. Quint. Mine is resolute. Marc. The better, let me hear it. Quin. This it is;â Defie him. Salv. Hold, I hope you will not, Quint. Be your own brothers heads-man, that but now Could not be won so much as read the Letter, Lest you should speak his sentence. Apul. Good my Lord, Preserve your self for better times; the State Will lose its soule, when tis depriv'd of you. Salv. Twill be a breathlesse trunk, a livelesse carkasse, When you are gone; which were the only blood And sinews of her liberty. 1 Friend. Alas! We shall be prey'd upon by ravenous Vultures, And those insulting Eagles of Ambition. 2 Friend. Think but of this when Catilines arise, Where shall we find new Cicero's to oppose them? 3 Friend. Where shall opprest and wronged Citizens Find upright Patrons, that will stick to justice, Not fearing to incur a great ones frown? They may as soon climb up to heaven, and bring AstrÃ¦a down again; unhappy Rome! Quint. I do confesse good friends the common-wealth Will misse a Cicero; and that my brother, If we respect the wishes of the people, And wants of the Republick, has not yet Liv'd half of half his time; but if we cast A backward eye upon his glorious actions, Has liv'd a goodly age, and cannot now Die immaturely. Look upon the state Of present things, the downfall of our liberty, (And heaven knows what calamities will follow) I think you cannot be so much his foe, As not to say, he has now liv'd too long. Apul. Ah! but the publick good's to be preferr'd Before respects of private consequence. Quint. But Publius, the State is now so wounded That there's no hope of cure, and therefore may Our old Physitians safely give it o're; Were he an Ãsculapius that could put New life into a State, as once that son Of PÃ¦an did to Virbius; I should then Blaspheme Great Jove himself, should he but aim His triforkt flames against him; but for one Now sinking of himself into his grave, And such a one as Cicero, in these times, When such mens ages are but vain, what sepulcher Can be more fit, more glorious then the same Wherein his countreys freedome lies enclos'd? If he now die, hee shall be buried With the renowned Pompeys, son and father; With Catulus, Petreius, and Afranius, Yea with Antonius that brave man, unworthy His noble stock should bear so foul a branch. But if he live, with whom I pray wilt be But Capho's, Saxa's, and Ventidii? Therefore good brother, (I confesse my eyes Doe swim with tears, yet shall my words proceed From a couragious mind) be still thy selfe; To the huge volume of Antonius faults Adde one crime more, even Cicero's death; 'twill stick Upon his name with a more lasting blot Then the most hainous of his other villanies. For should his future deeds pronounce him parallel To the great Alexander or Alcmena's son, From whom he fetches his vain pedigree; Should after ages wonder at his Acts, And say, why this, and this, and this he did, Built such a City, conquer'd such a Countrey, Thus and thus many rimes triumpht, with Kings And Queens to follow his victorious chariot; Yet, for a period to each glorious sentence, Some honest stander by will sighing say But he kill'd Cicero; Cicero shall still Much like Prometheus Vulture read and tear The very heart and liver of his name. Let Antony proscribe thee, let him Marcus, Why, he can do't but once, and that's some comfort; But thou shalt proscribe him unto eternity; It is not thy proscription he remits, But closely sues a pardon for his own. Beleeve me Marcus, 'tis the meanest part Which can be given, or taken from thee; that, That's the true Cicero which Antonius knows Cannot be proscrib'd but by Cicero. If Antony deceive, and break his faith, (As faith is seldome found in such as hee) Then thou must die. Suppose he doe perform it; Then must you live a vassall to his tyranny; Now which is to be chosen, death or servitude, I leave it to your self, and your own judgment. Yet my beloved Brother, by our Loves, By thy now well-spent three and sixty years; By thy renowned Consulship, the sacred And (if thou wilt) the everlasting memory Of thy admired Eloquence, by these And all that's dear unto thee, I adjure thee Die not confessing that thou wouldst not die. Mar. Friends, I am bound unto your cares, &amp; thank you That not affection only, which were fond, But the Republicks good, has been the motive Of your perswasions. Well; I promise you I will doe nothing unbeseeming Cicero. Frame your hopes complement by this. I shall Dispatch the messenger my self. Salv. Good Cicero Remember us and Rome. Apul. We were not born (Tis your own saying) for our selves alone, Our Countrey claims a part. Cic. Farewell, farewell, Farewell my Friends; but Quintus, let me have Your company. Quint. You shal. Apul. Nay then I fear. Exeunt Mar. Come Brother Quintus, thou hast bravely argu'd; Why weep'st thou? Quint. Doe you then approve my language? I will unsay it. Mar. Nay, thou shalt not, canst not. Come, come, let's in, thy self shall only hear How I will send defiance to Antonius. Exeunt Enter Laureas and Tyro. Laur. What thinkst thou Tyro that my Lord admits None but his brother Quintus to th'delivery Of his reply? Tyr. I cannot guesse the reason. Laur. Me thinks he should not bar their longing ears The hearing, if he does intend acceptance Of the Triumvirs proffer. But I fear He does not prize his life at such a rate. âTyro. Tush, life is precious. Laur. But honor more; âAnd what is life? Tyro. Tis Natures gift. Lau. A poore âAnd worthlesse jewell fastned by a hair âTo th'ear of vanity. Tyro. It is the fair âAnd sprightly shine of this compendious world. âLaur. And from what PhÅbus is that lustre hurld. âTyro. The soul. La. A short liv'd day, a twi-light sun, âWhose fading beauties cease when scarce begun. âBut honor is a day, that knows no night, âAnd ever triumphs in immortall light. I think Antonius might have done more wisely, And might have sooner compast his desires, If he had only sent him life, without The intimation of those harsh conditions; For so he could not in my slender judgment, On such applausive terms have contradicted The proffer'd benefit of his life, and then I am perswaded fully that my Lord Would ne'r have let posterity have known His hate to Antony, from whom he should Have daign'd th'acceptance of a slavish breath. Tyro. Come, prethy leave, I shall despair anon. Exeunt. Enter M. Cicero solus. Now I have seal'd my fate, I must expect The second message for my head. I must? What, may not man unlock this Cabinet, And free the heavenly jewell of his soul? A wise man stays not Natures period, but If things occurre, which trouble his tranquillity, Emits himself, departing out of life As from a stage or Theatre, nor passes Whether he take or make his dissolution; Whether he doe't in sicknesse or in health. Tis base to live, but brave to die by stealth, This is the daring Stoicks glorious language I was my self too of the opinion once; But now I find it impious and unmanly. For as some pictures drawn with slender lines, Deceiving almost our intentive eyes, Affect us much, and with their subtilties Wooe us to gaze upon them, but are found By skilfull and judicious eyes to erre In symmetry of parts, and due proportion; Even so the Stoicks Arguments are carved With seeming curiousnesse, almost forcing judgment, And carry with them an applausive shew Of undeniable verity, yet well scann'd They are more like the dreams of idle braines, Then the grave dictates of Philosophers: The wise Pythagoras was opinion'd better, For most divinely he forbids us leave The corps due guard without our Captains license. And to speak true, we are but Usufructuaries, The God that governs in us is proprietary. A Prisoner breaking from his Gaol or hold; If he be guilty, aggravates his guilt; If innocent, stains even that innocence Which might perhaps have brought him cleerly off. Tis so with us; our Magistrate, I mean The power that's soveraign of this naturall frame, Has sent us (Plato saies from heavenly mansions) Into this fleshy prison; here we live, And must not free our selves, but patiently Expect our summons from that sacred power By his Lieutenant Death. For otherwise We become guilty of a greater sin Then Parricide it self, no bond of Nature Being so neer, as of one to himself. The GrÃ¦cians knew this, when they judg'd the body Of Ajax who had slain himself, unworthy The common rites of buriall. Carefull Nature Has fenc'd our hearts about with certain bones; Fashioned like swords; and shall we break the guard? No, rather let us wait the will of th'heavens, And, when we hence are warned by their Ordinance, Let us depart with glad and joyfull hearts, And think our selves delivered from a gaol, Eased of gives and fetters, that we may Remove unto our own eternall dwelling; For, without doubt, that power that gave us being, Did not beget and foster us for this, That having suffer'd on this stage of life Thousand afflictions, infinite calamities, Quotidian toiles, and all in Virtues cause, We should for guerdon fall into the gulph Of an eternall death, and non-subsistence. Yea, rather let us cherish this belief That there's another haven provided for us, A blessed refuge for our longing souls. Arm'd with a setled confidence of this, Like Socrates I will outface my death, And with the same fixt spirit resign my breath. Enter Quintus. Marc. How now? Quint. O brother, there's no remedy But die we must, or save our selves by flight. Mar. Why, if the Destinies have so determin'd, Welcome the easer of our woes, Sweet Death. But what's the matter Quintus? Quin. The Triumvirs Are posting with a threatning speed to Rome; They come like thunder, and are bringing with them A bloudy tempest. Marc. Who can help it brother? Yet wee'l incline the times malignity; The heavens must not be tempted; we are to keep This fortresse of our lives safe from invasion; Why did they else intrust us with it? now That cannot be without the use of means; We must not look to escape the jaws of Scylla, When by our own improvident carelesnesse, We are ingulpht already. He that thinks Surrounded with his enemies to scape (As Homer fables in the Trojan war) Inveloped with a cloud, may be deceiv'd. No Quintus, we will fly, or, if that word Be, as the Stoicks prattle, not beseeming A prudent man, we will give way to th'times, We will depart. Qu. But whither? Marc. Whither, Quintus, But into Macedon to my dearest Brutus? Prethy see all things suddenly prepared; Wee'l first unto my house at Tusculum; Thence to Astyra, so to Macedon. Exit. Qu. Marc. I have a heart dares meet a thousand deaths, But yet my soul is griev'd to see these days. Are all my labors come to this? my watchings? My cares and services for the publick good? The dangers which I daily have incurr'd By opposition of new-springing Tyranny? Are all, all my endeavours come to this, That they now seem to have precipitated This ruin on us, rather then withstood it? Unhappy Rome! the Deities decreed This downfall of thy liberty; for never Could all our labours have been so pernicious, Unlesse there had a greater power dispos'd them To this sad end; which was the sole Charybdis, Whence we directed thy now shipwrackt bark. This sinks me in a sea of grief, thy Senators Shall die like Victimes, Ruffians be the Priests; And thou the Altar, in their wretched entrails A dismall horrid augury shall be written, Even thy eternall bondage to oppression. Enter Quint. Pomponia. Quint. jun. muta persona. Marc. Are all things ready? Quint. Yes, or will be straight, But the Triumvirs are not with such hast Posting to th'City, as I was inform'd, Yet there are certain Centiners they say Coming as Harbingers. Marc. Beleeve me Quintus, We have the greater reason to be packing; These are the lightning previous to that thunder, Whereof you spake before. And lightning strikes not The humble cottage, but the towering edifice. I see the loved objects which imprint, Those characters of sadnesse in thy visage. Grieve not Pomponia, Thou art happy, Sister, Thou maist remain in thine own native Rome, No Antony thirsts for thy blood, thou maist In peace adore the deities of thy countrey, Yea and the Lares of thy private house; When such as we, must leave our ancient homes, Yea and our Country to a heavier woe. Pomp. And that 'tis grieves me brother; what content, What pleasure can I take in any thing, When my beloved Quintus is departed? My life will not be vitall. O my Quintus. Soul of my soul. Quin. Pomponia, doe not weep, Tears are an ill presage to such a journey. Enter Laureas, Tyro, Philologus. Marc. What are the Litters ready? Laur. Yes my Lord. Quint. My life Pomponia, now farewell. Pomp. Nay husband, I'l see your setting forth, I will enjoy As long as possibly I may thy sight, Heaven knows if ever I shall see you more. Marc. Nay Sister, now your grief is too extream, Pomp. It cannot brother. Marc. Yes, for though you part, Thy loving spouse shall leave behind his heart, Exeunt omnes. Chorus. Where is that ancient beauty, Rome, Was wont to shine About thy head? where are become Those rayes divine? Survey thy Fortunes, stupid City, Look, look and know Thy selfe turn'd monument of pity, A map of woe. But thou art deaf; well vaunting stand And tell't about, It was thy once renowned hand Thrust Tarquin out; Proclaim it, Citizens, that you Did Melius quell That Cassius and Manlius too, Your Victimes fell. Boast this, and more, doe, but withall With horrour say, You did it only to install Worse plagues then they, That you one viper of the State Have chang'd for three; And for a worse Triumvirate A Monarchy. Alas, Alas, where shall we shroud Our wretched heads? For this threatning pendulous cloud Wide ruine spreads. Our ship upon a rock is cast, Our saile yards mourn, The Northwind has beat down our Mast, Our sheets are torn; Our Cables too (alas!) are lost, Oares have we none, And that which grieves and cuts us most, Our Pilot's gone. What helps, weak Vessell, on this shelfe Thy birth divine? In vain, in vain, thou vaunt'st thy selfe, A Pontick Pine; In vain thou invocat'st thy two Tyndarian Gods, They are t'anticipate such woe Too weak by ods. Then since poor wretches, ah! we must Our selves compose To bear each rigid storm, each gust, Each wave that flowes; O let us pray, this dangerous floud Doe not become A dead sea, or a sea of bloud, And its own Tombe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Enter Salvius and others. Salv. Friends, you are welcome, why so sad, I pray? Those looks be sit not feasts; invest your browes In the glad livery of smiles; be merry; Mirth is the only essence of a feast. But ah, how ill do's this dissembled jollity Suit with my inside, or the times? I have Invited you this night unto a supper, The last, for ought I know, that I shall tast In your desired companies. Tis true; The Tribuneship was ever till this day Esteemed holy, and of sacred power; But from those men which coyn new offices, What must the old expect but foul misprision? Should Jove himself come down from his Olympus, Not shadowing his Deity with a vaile, But in's most God-like majesty, I think For one Lycaon, he might now find three, And such that would with more unheard of savagenesse Feast his divinity; not with some poor infant, But even their Mothers flesh, I mean their countreys, And 'stead of Nectar give him bloud to drink; You know how fraught with zeal unto the cause Of the Republick, I have now cashier'd And quit that sink of villainous Rebellion Antonius party, and have stuck to Cicero, The truest Patriot Rome was ever blest with; And can I hope to meet with milder stormes Then those who's only distant apparition Has made him timely seek another harbour? Which from my soul I wish he may obtain; Nay rather if that good man fear'd a shower, I must expect a tempest; for our nature Hates more implacably a declined friend Then a continued foe. Since therefore Antony And his two fellow plagues are now approaching, Since there are Centiners arriv'd already, Their fatall Mercuries, perhaps, t'extinguish Those carefull eyes, whose restlesse vigilance Has been imploy'd in service of the State, (As sure they come to some such bloody end) Let me enjoy you with the same solemnity As parting friends take leave of one another. Yet mingle something of the Thracian mirth Among your sighs; let's laugh away our sorrow, We may perhaps with Pluto sup to morrow. Exeunt. Enter Centurion, Soldiers. Centurion. Come Soldiers, Salvius Otho, as I hear, Is frolick with his neighbors at a feast, Wee'l spoil their second course. You know the price Whereat the heads are rated by the Triumvirs. Come follow me. Exeunt. A Table discovered. Salvius and his friends. To them the Centurion. Centur. Nay stir not, Sirs, be still, and keep your places, Lest your own folly make your selves copartners In this mans fall, which must be sudden.âTribune. Pulls. Salvius o're the Table by the hairs of the head. A Curtain drawn. Enter Centurion with Salvius head. Cent. Now for Minutius. Exeunt. Enter Minutius disguis'd. Minut. Nay leave me Serjeants, I am still Minutius Although disguis'd, and if you longer stay Those very ensignes of my PrÃ¦torship Will soon betray me, and perhaps the Axe Which you there carry may strike off my head. Exit. Lictores. Alas, alas, but left our too much piety Prove our own Lords destruction, let's be gone. Exeunt. Enter Centurion, Soldiers. Cent. He cannot be escaped far, that's certain. What should the Lictors else doe here? goe search. Yet M. Tullius, with whose execution Exeunt milites. We were most strictly charged, is escap'd, With Quintus Cicero. But the Colonell Popilius LÃ¦nas, and Herennius I hope will overtake them. Enter Soldiers with Minutius head. Sold. Here's the head Of that tall Poppy. Centu. Why, 'tis bravely done. Come, there are more such Cedars to be lopt. Exeunt. Enter Quintus Cicero. Quint. They say the golden and the silver age Was then, when frugall mankind was content With those displayed riches, which the earth Invests her self with, and her conceal'd entrails Were not rent up in quarries deep as hell, For those pernicious world-disturbing metals; But sure this is the age of gold and silver. When those two precious perils, are the poles And hinges of the world, whereon it moves; I might perhaps with my beloved brother Have been secure and safe, whereas being forc'd For lack of money to return, each step I take, is ready to surrender me Into the hands of death. Enter Quintus jun. Quint. jun. O Father, Father, Your treacherous Servants have betray'd you, come For heavens sake, come, death, death is at your heels. Exeunt. Enter Centurion, Soldiers. Cent. Bring his son hither, though you find not him. Exeunt Sold. Quintus return'd! I wonder where's his brother. Enter Soldiers with Quintus jun. Sold. Himself we cannot find, but here's young Quin. Cent. Come yongster, where's your father, quickly tel me. Quint. jun. O that I knew, my ever honor'd Sire, The place of thy abode, alas; or whether Thou art yet living, or hast now breath'd forth Thy sacred spirit! for a thousand pains, My breast all gor'd with darts, hands cut with chains, Famin, or sword, or all should never move Me make a rupture in my filiall love. Cent. Cease this dissembling language, and reveal him, Or by the Heavens thou diest. Quint. jun. No, villainous Centurion threaten life, If I knew where my reverend father were, That would extort it soonest. Tis my wish I may soon quit this life. Cent. With stripes, with wounds, With torments worse then death; impetuous pains Shall rend thy secrets from thy stubborn brest. Qu. jun. Pish! these are nothing, threat more &amp; heavier, Expose me to the ravenous Lyons paw; Fling me into some common Jakes, or Dungeon, Wind off my flesh with pinsers, doe and cram Young Vultures with the bits before my eyes; Yet had I hid my father, as you deem, I never would betray so dear, so sacred, So glorious a treasure. Cent. Take him thence, And torture this fond else till he confesse. Quint. sen. Above. Exeunt Soldiers with Quintus jun. Quint. sen. O what a virtuous son have I, was ever Such piety in so few years? he dares Th'extreamest of their tortures, with a spirit Constant as Virtue's self. See how they wrack him! My melting bowells yern within me; oh! Each stripe they give him cuts my very soul. See, see, they are even weary of tormenting, And yet the youth stil firm. O Piety! Enter Soldiers with young Qu. as from torture. Cent. What? where's his father? has he yet confest? Quint. jun. Confest Centurion! no I will not, cannot, I am not Juno's Iris, that my eyes Should reach from hence to Macedon. Cent. To Macedon? Why his own servants say he is return'd. Q. ju. Such slaves as they that would betray their master, If he were in their clutches; may not they Cheat thee as well? Cent. Tis folly to conceale, What force shall soon unbosome: speak, Where is he? Qu. ju. What's that to thee? I dare the worst, Centurion, Thy malice can inflict. Cen. Nay, then I see I must my self chastise you; come ye weesell. Enter Quint. sen. Qu. sen. Nay hold Centurion, here I am before you, Quintus the father whom you seek for. Qui. ju. Ah, What mean you father, that you thrust your self Into the jaws of certain fate? I could Have spit defiance in the face of cruelty. Though she had harbour'd in her friendlike looks A thousand deaths. Quint. sen. Indeed I doe beleeve it, And let me kisse thee for thy piety; But old unfruitfull stocks must be cut down, When their decaying, and now saplesse heads Keep off the quickning sun-beans from the young And hopefull tenderlings which they overtop. Suppose, my son, I had still liv'd, and thou Been made a prey to their relentlesse rage, I should have died too: for my bloudlesse loins Are dry and barren; but in thee my son I shall survive my self. Cent. Ha, ha, ha! Qu. sen. I hope you doe not mock at my calamity. Cent. Survive in him? I, so you shall, and both Be ferryed o're the Stygian lake together. Qu. sen. What! must my son then die? what has he done, Alas? Cent. Tis crime enough to have a life. Qu. sen. Then kill me first, for sure I shall anticipate Your bloody hands, if I but see him slain. Q. jun. Nay on my knees with suppliant breath I beg I may die first, it is a boone I shal Prize even above my life. Cent. Wee'l soon decide you controversie, you shall die together. (Both slain.) Cent. Take hence the bodies and unhead them quickly. Exeunt. Enter Popilius LÃ¦nas with Marcus Tullius Cicero's head and hands. A princely gift, by Jove; Popilius LÃ¦nas, Thou hast now play'd the royal butcher, on; And let Antonius blesse his longing eyes With sight of such a welcome present. Ha! Is this that Cicero's head that thunder'd so In our Tribunalls? Ha! is this that mouth Was wont to spit such lightning? or are those, Those hands which whilome thumpt our Rostra so? I, even the self same head, and mouth, and hands. Then Antony triumph, thy foe is dead, The trophies of his fall, these hands, this head. Exit. Enter Pomponia, Laureas, Tyro. Laur. Dire, horrid, bitter fates! did Rome ere see A cruelty of such a high degree? Whose griefs shall I first publish? thine, Unhappy Widow? or the States? or mine? Thine that hast lost so excellent a brother? The States, that cannot now produce another, So reverend a Patriot? or mine own, That have now lost so good a Lord? I grone Under the burden of my losse, nor can Summon the smallest character of Man Into my wounded brest. Pomp. Come, Laureas, come, Expound the series of his death; my heart Is turned adamant, I cannot weep, Stupidity has seiz'd me, and me thinks I feel a kind of pleasure in the story Of woes compleat and perfect, I am even Transformed to a statue: Smal griefs mourn, But great ones, such as mine, much like the head Of the deformed Gorgon, turn to stone, And make us our own sepulchres. Laur. Good Tyro, Tell thou the Tragick story, for my voice Is strangled by a throng of strugling sighs, Crouding from out my wounded brest. Tyro. Then thus. Departing hence we went to Tusculum, Where hearing of these Outlawries and proscriptions, They suddenly determin'd for Astyra. So we convey'd them both into two Litters Weak as they were alas; but on the way Your husband calling to his sad remembrance That at his fatall setting forth he took But little money with him, and his brother My Lord had scarce sufficient for himself; He thought it best in such an urgent straight, His brother should hold on, while he himself Returned home to furnish him with necessaries, And so to hast and overtake him; this They both agreed upon, and so embracing Tears trickling down their cheeks, they took their leaves Of one another. Laur. Thus departing soules Doe bid adue unto their fading mansions, For never nature strove so much, as when This honor'd pair sigh't forth their last farewells. Twas a sad Omen that they ne'r should meet. Tyro. My Lord being come at length unto Astyra, Found a ship ready and imbarqu'd immediatly, And with a fair and prosp'rous gale of wind Sailed along the coast unto Mount Circe, And there he landed; but on other thoughts He went aboard again, for 'twas his mind To be convey'd by sea unto his farm Which is by Capua; but before we landed, Rowing securely by the pleasant shore, Our linnens swelling with th'Etesian gales, Which in the Summer season fan that tract, A shole of Crowes came waving through the aire, As we conjectur'd from a little Temple Standing upon the shore, and dedicated To God Apollo; these most strangely crying Lighted upon our Saleyards, with their bills Pulling the cords, which made our heavy hearts Presage some sinister and dismall luck Then imminent, yet being come a land, We brought him to his house, where he repos'd Himself a while, to see if he could sleep. Laur. Unhappy sleep! for straight this drouzy brother, Was seconded by his pale sister Death. Tyro. But loe, the former shole with louder crye, Came hither also, beating 'gainst the windows, Till some of them got in, and never ceas'd. Till with their bills they had pluckt off at length The cloathes wherewith his face was covered. We, seeing this, were angry with our selves As too too negligent of our Masters safety, Saying we were more vile then savage creatures, Should we still tarry in that fatall place, And see perhaps our Lord, before our eyes Cruelly butcher'd, wherefore with all speed Partly by force, and partly by intreaty, We cary him again unto his Litter, And so in hast departed toward the sea; But being come into a shady wood Which the Sun never pierces with his beams To glad the widowed earth. Laur. A place decreed By fate, I think, for such a villany; For should the Sun have seen so foul an act, Ile would have turned retrograde, and hid His visage from such cruelty. Tyro. Well here, In this same gloomy canopy of horror, Popilius LÃ¦nas overtook the Litter. Pomp. Who, he whose cause my brother Marcus once Pleaded before the Judges, when he was Accused for his fathers death? Tyro. The same. We stood prepar'd to spend our dearest bloud, Before we would have seen our Master slain; But ah! my Lord commands us not to stir, And to speak truth, it was in vain, for LÃ¦nas Had armed Soldiers with him, and was followed By other Centiners. Then, O then my Lord Thrust out his aged head from forth the Litter, And taking, as his manner was, his beard In his left hand, and looking manfully His Headsman in the face, he stoutly said, Come Soldier, come, strike off this head of mine. Laur. We stood like statues with our trembling hands Before our wretched eyes, for 'twould have struck A Tyger with remorse to have beheld him. Tyro. Then LÃ¦nas with a thrice repeated stroke Hackt off his head; there was scarce bloud enough Fell from those aged veins to stain the sword, And prove it conscious of so foul a murder. Laur. Thus was divided from his breathlesse trunk That sacrary of Learning, where the Graces, Graces that never had a Cytherea To be their Mistresse, mov'd in their right sphears. Where Hermes was inthron'd, that winged. Patron Of heaven-born elocution, but without His filching Art; for that State-piracy The bribing Science was as far from him As Themis self; where Pallas too was lodg'd, Not she that strove with Venus for an apple On the IdÃ¦an hill, but such a one That deem'd externalls but as chaffe and dust, In lieu of inward beauties, which inform The Intelligences of our souls, and make them Comply with Heaven and Immortality. Lastly, where all the Deities invested In their divinest purities, did dwell As 'twere in a compendious Capitoll. Tyro. But Cicero's reverend head was not enough; The hands that wrote those glorious Philippicks Must be cut off too. Laur. Those illustrious hands Which once held up this tottering Common-wealth, And see her on her feet, when she was falling From her proud or be into a gulph of Fire. Tyro. That head, those hands, are both divorc't, &amp; sever'd From his now moldred carkasse, and no doubt Are by this time Antonius game and sport; For LÃ¦nas posted with them to the City. Pomp. Why, here's a story at whose sad relation, Democritus might change his laughing humour And fide with Heraclitus. As for me I cannot weep; but Laureas, prethy tell me How came Popilius to find you out? Me thinks he could not, without information, So shrewdly light upon the self same way Which you had took before him; was it fate? Laur. Twas fate, that's certain Madam, 'twas, but ah There was an engine which the Destinies Did make their agent. Pomp. Whom? Tyro. Philologus. Pomp. Philologus? Laur. I, he betray'd your brother. The Oracle from which he learn'd the mysteries Of pure Philosophy. He, he it was Who, being left behind us at the house, Reveal'd the way we took unto the Colonell. Pomp. And where's the villain? Laur. Brought by LÃ¦nas hither To be rewarded of Antonius As for a service of egregious merit. Pomp. I, so he shall, I'l see his wages paid. Exit Pomp. Laur. Come Tyro, since our day is set for ever, Wee'l live like owles, those Citizens of Night. Like Owles indeed, but like Athenian owles; Thou shalt sublime thy pen, and write the life Of our deceased Lord, that spotlesse life, Which Vertue's self might mahe her meditation. Tyro thou shalt, and I poor Laureas, I Will sit and sigh forth mourning Elegies Upon his death, he while he liv'd good man, Delighted in my Muse, and now my quill Shall consecrate his name toth'Muses hill. Exeunt. Enter Antonius, Fulvia. Popilius LÃ¦nas crowned, Cicero's head in one hand, and his hands in the other. Ant. LÃ¦nas, 'twas nobly done, and thou hast well Deserv'd that crown which circles in thy Temples. The head of Marcus Tullius Cicero! Takes it of Popilius. Why 'tis a Kingly present, Ha, ha, ha! Derides and misuses it. Fulv. To mee. Ant. Rub and a good cast. Ha, ha, ha! Fulv. Bravely bowl'd, i'faith. Come up here. Takes it up, and sitting down places it upon her knees. Now I'l be revenged For your tart nipping jeersâyes Reverend Sir, Fulvia's indebted to the State:âtoo long. Ex. 2. Phil. The no whit covetous wife of Antony, Whom you describe without all contumely, Owes the third pension to the Roman people. Indeed! but does shee? yes, nor will I wrong The people of their due, the debt's thy tongue. Cuts out his tongue. Here tak't. I warrant him for barking now. Twill make a better foot-ball then a bowle. Kicks it away. Ant. Have at it. (Coytes the hands to the head.) Take them good Popilius, And place them on the Rostra, where he vomited His Philippicks against me. Let his head Be set betwixt his hands, 'twill be a brave And goodly spectacle. Popil. I will my Lord. Exit. Ant. Doe Fulvia stab it; give't as many wounds As Julius CÃ¦sar had, whose horrid murder, That worme extoll'd as an heroick deed. Well I must leave you for a while to meet My Colleagues, Lepidus and Octavius CÃ¦sar. Exit. Fulv. That such a paultry thing as this should make So great a bustling in a Commonwealth? I heard my husband once compare his lungs To Vulcans bellows, and his head to Ãtna, His words to flame, and this his tongue to fire. But now I think 'tis quencht, it burns not now; Nay, 'tis as cold as stone, no thunder in't, No lightning flies from't. Sure this is not that Herculean tongue that lately was so weighty, That it could crush such Gyants of the State As it hath done to Nothing. Yes the same. Then Fulvia march along, and banish fear, Thou hast that tongue upon thy silver spear. Exit. Enter Pomponia. Pomp. Anger will give me strength, Bloudy Antonius Thou shalt not thus evade; as once the stout And stern Amazon foil'd the GrÃ¦cian rout, Or as th'enraged MÃ¦nas arm'd with thyrse, With pace directed by inspired force, Affrights the woods, and quite distract makes gush, The bloud which she perceives not; wil I rush Upon these Roman Canniballs; if I die I shall enjoy my Quintus company. Alas, alas! what foolish rage is this? We must appeal to heaven when we are wrong'd, And not be our own carvers. Such State-gyants Must have a Jove to curb them. Yet Philologus, That traitrous villain, that ungratefull wretch, Whom not my husbands Manumission, Nor the divinest precepts of my brother, Could keep within the bounds of faith and piety, He, he shall rue it if I live, base Caitiffe! Flourish. Enter Antonius, Lepidus, Octavius, Piso, and others. Pomponia. Cruell Triumvir, though thou hast unliv'd My honour'd husband, my beloved son, Though thou hast slain my brother, and with him Rent up the very groundwork of our Capitoll. And shown more cruelty to those sacred reliques Of his dissolved corps, then Victory Did perpetrate on the Ãmathian Perseus On the triumphed Jugurth, and King Syphax, Or Hannibal himself, not one of whom Was sent defective to the lower shades With members violated, yet I come not, Like the poor widow'd Hecuba, to raile And tell thee to what depth thou hast transgrest The laws of goodnesse, and religious Nature, Making thy self the hate of men and Gods, Nor doe I come to beg thy infamous sword To rip that wombe whose fruit thou hast destroy'd, Though I would hug my destiny. No Antony, But only to put up a fair Petition, Whose grant will somewhat wipe away the rust Which sullies thy bad name, and make posterity Say thou didst something worthy of a Roman, And thy renowned stock; and this it is, By all that's dear unto thee, I beseech thee Shelter not treason, but deliver me The villain that betray'd my brother Marcus. Ant. Philologus? Pomp. I, hee Sir. Ant. Bring him forth. Though such a treason was expedient, Yet such a Traitor must not live. CÃ¦s. My Lord, You are most just in't. Lep. So says Lepidus. Piso. Tis god-like equity. Enter with Phil. Ant. Pomponia take him, he's at your disposing. Pomp. You heard that, Varlet, now you're mine again; I'le make you prey to a more hellish vulture Then that of Tityus, thou thy self shalt slice Thy own foul flesh by morsells off, and make Thy own gaunt entrailes thy own sepulcher; Nay 'tis in vain. Phil. For heavens sake, good my Lord. She drags him out. Enter Popilius LÃ¦nas. Popil. My Lord, the Tribune Publius Apuleius Is with his wife escap'd away by flight. Ant. No matter, my long wisht for aim is wonne, And Cicero slain, the whole prescription's done. FINIS.</field>
