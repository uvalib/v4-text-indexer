      <field name="fulltext">TO MY WORTHY FRIEND THE AVTHOR VPON HIS TRAGÃ-COMÃDY, THE MAID OF HONOVR. Was not thy Emperor enough before For thee to give, that thou dost give vs more? I would be just, but cannot: that I know I did not slander, this I feare I doe. But pardon mee, if I offend: Thy fire Let equall Poets praise, while I admire. Jf any say that I enough have writ, They are thy foes, and envy at thy wit. Believe not them, nor mee, they know thy lines Deserve applause, but speake against their mindes. I, out of iustice, would commend thy Play, But (friend forgive mee) 'tis above my way. One word, and I have done (and from my heart Would I could speake the whole truth, not the part) Because 'tis thine; it henceforth will be said, Not the Maid of Honour, but the Honour'd Maid. Aston Cokayne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Scene. 1. Astutio. Adorni. Adorni. Good day to your Lordship. Astutio. Thanks Adorni. Ador. May I presume to aske if the Embassador Imploy'd by Ferdinand, the Duke of Urbin Hath audience this morning? Enter Fulgent. Astu. 'Tis uncertaine, For though a counsaylor of state, I am not Of the Cabinet counsaile. But ther's one if he please That may resolve you. Ador. I will move him Sr. Aulgen. If you have a suite, shew water, I am blinde else. Ador. A suite, yet of a nature, not to prove The quarrie that you hawke for: If your words Are not like Indian wares, and every scruple To be waigh'd and rated, one poore sillable Vouchsaf'd in answer of a faire demand, Cannot deserve a fee. Fulgen. It seemes you are ignorant, I neiher speake, nor hold my peace for nothing: And yet for once, I care not if I answer One single question, gratia. Ador. I much thanke you. Hath the Embassador audience Sir to day? Fulgen. Yes. Ador. At what houre? Fulgen. I promis'd not so much. A sillable you begg'd, my Charity gaue it. Move me no further. Exit Fulgentio. Astu. This you wonder at? With me 'tis usuall. Ador. Pray you Sr. what is he? Astu. A Gentlemaan, yet no lord. He hath some drop: Of the Kings blood running in his veines, deriu'd Some ten degrees off. His revenue lyes In a narrow compasse, the King eare, and yeelds him Every houre a fruitfull harvest. Men may talke Of three croppes in a yeare in the fortunate Islands. Or profit made by wooll. But while there are sutors, His sheepe sheering, nay shaving to the quicke Is in every quarter of the Moone, and constant, In the time of trussing a point, he can undoe Or make a man. His play or recreation Is to raise this up, or pull downe that, and though He neve yet tooke or ders, makes more Bishops In Sicilie, then the Pope himselfe. Enter Bertoldo, Gasparo, Anthonio, a servant: Ador. Most strange! Astu. The presence fils. He in the Malta habit Is the naturall brother of the King, a by blow. Ador. I understand you. Gasp. Morrow to my Vncle. Antho. And my late Guardian. But at length I have The reignes in my owne hands. Astu. Pray you use 'em well, Or you'll too late repent it. Ber. With this Iewell Presented to Camiola, prepare This night a uisit for me. I shall have Exit servant. Your company Gallants I perceive, if that The King will heare of war. Antho. Sr. I have horses Of the best breed in Naples, fitter far To breake a ranke, then cracke a lance, and are In their carere of such incredible swiftnes They out-strip swallowes. Ber. And such may bee usefull To run away with, should we be defeated. You are well provided Signior Antho. Sr. excuse me. All of their race by instinct know a Coward, And scorne the burthen. They come on like lightning, Founder'd in a retreat. Ber. By no meanes backe 'em. Vnlesse you know your courage sympathize With the daring of your horse. Antho. My lord, this is hitter. Gasp. I will rayse me a company of foote, And when at push of pike I am to enter A breach, to shew my valour, I have bought mee An armor cannon proofe Ber. You will not leape then Ore an out-worke in your shirt? Gasp. I do not like Activity that way. Ber. You had rather stand A marke to try their muskets on? Gasp. If I doe No good, I'll doe no hurt. Ber. 'Tis in you Signior A Christian resolution, and becomes you, But I will not discourage you. Antho. You are Sr. A knight of Malta, and as I have heard, Have serv'd against the Turke. Ber. 'Tis true. Antho. Pray you shew vs The difference betweene the city valour. And service in the field. Ber. 'Tis somewhat more Then roaring in a taverne, or a brothell, Or to steale a Constable from a sleeping watch; Then burne their halberds; or safe guarded by Your tenants sonnes, to carry away a Maypole From a neighbour village; you will not finde there Your Masters of Dependencies to take up A drunken brawle, or to get you the names Of valiant Cheivaleirs, fellowes that will bee For a cloake with thrice died veluet, and a cast suite Kick'd down the stairs. A knave with halfe a britch there, And no shirt (being a thing superfluous, And worne out of his memorie) if you beare not Your selves both in, and upright with a provant sword Will slash your skarlets, and your plush a new way; Or with the hilts thunder about your eares Such musicke as will make your worships dance To the dolefull tune of Lachryma, Gasp. I must tell you, In priuate, as you are my princely friend, I doe not like such Fidlers. Bertol. No? they are usefull For your imitation; I remember you When you came first to the Court, and talkt of nothing But you rents, and your entradas; ever chiming The golden bells in your pockets, you belieu'd The taking of the wall, as a tribute due to Your gaudy clothes; and could not walke at mid-night Without a causelesse quarrell, as if men Of courser outsides were in duty bound To suffer your affronts: but when you had beene Cudzell'd well, twice or thrice, and from the doctrine Made profitabe uses, you concluded The soveraigne meanes to teach irregular heyres Civility, with conformity of manners, VVere two or three sound beatings. Antho. I confesse They did much good upon mee. Gasp. And on meeâthe principles that they read were sound. Bertol. You'll finde The like instructions in the Campe. Astu. The King. A Florish. Enter Roberto, Fulgentio. Embassador. Attendants. Rober. VVee sit prepar'd to heare. Embas. Your Majesty Hath beene long since familiar, I doubt not, VVith the desperate fortunes of my Lord, and pitty Of the much that your confederate hath suffer'd (You being his last refuge) may perswade you Not alone to compassionate, but to lend Your royall aydes to stay him in his fall To certaine ruine. Hee too late is conscious, That his ambition to incroach upon His neighbours territories, with the danger of His liberty, nay his life, hath brough in question His owne inheritance: but youth and heat Of blood, in your interpretation, may Both plead, and mediate for him. I must grant it An error in him, being deni'd the favours Of the faire Princesse of Siena (though He sought her in a noble way) t'endeavour To forte affection, by surprisall of Her principall seat Siena. Rober. VVhich now proves The seat of his captivity. not triumph. Heaven is still just. Embas. And yet that justice is To be with mercy temper'd, which heau'ns Deputies Stand bound to minister. The injur'd Duchesse By reason taught, as nature, could not with The reparation of her wrongs, but aime at A brave revenge, and my Lord feeles too late That innocence will finde friends. The great Gonzaga, The honor of his Order, I must praise Vertue, though in an enemy. Hee whose fights And conquests hold one number, rallying up Her scatter'd troopes, before wee could get time To victuall, or to man the conquer'd City, Sate downe before it, and presuming that 'Tis not to be releev'd, admits no parley, Our flags of truce hung out in vaine, nor will hee Lend an eare to composition, but exacts With the rendring up the towne, the goods, and liues Of all within the walls, and of all Sexes To be at his discretion. Roberto. Since injustice In your Duke, meets this correction, can you presse us With any seeming argument of reason, In foolish pitty to decline his dangers, To draw 'em on our selfe? Shall we not be, Warn'd by his harmes? The league proclaim'd between us. Bound neither of us farther then to ayde Each other, if by forraigne force invaded, And so farre in my honour I was tied. But since without our counsell, or allowance, He hath tooke armes, with his good leave, he must Excuse us, if wee steere not on a rocke We see, and may avoyd. Let other Monarchs Contend to be made glorious by proud warre, And with the blood of their poore subjects purchase Increase of Empire, and augment their cares In keeping that which was by wrongs extorted; Guilding unjust invasions with the trimne Of glorious conquests; wee that would be knowne The father of our people in our study, And vigilance for their safety, must not change Their plough-shares into swords, or force them from The secure shade of their owne vines to be Scorch'd with the flames of warre, or for our sport Expose their liues to ruine. Embas. Will you then In his extremity forsake your friend? Roberto. No, but preserue our selfe. Bertol. Cannot the beames Of honour thaw your icie feares? Roberto. VVho's that? Rertol. A kinde of brother, Sir, how e'er your subject, Your father's Sonne, and one who blushes that You are not heire to his brave spirit, and vigour, As to his Kingdome. Roberto. How's this? Bertol. Sir, to be His living Chronicle, and to speake his praise Cannot deserve your anger. Rober. VVhere's your warrant For this presumption? Bertol. Here, Sir, in my heart. Let Sycophants, that feed upon your favours, Stile coldnesse in you caution, and preferre Your ease before your honour; and conclude To eate and sleepe supinely, is the end Of humane blessings: I must tell you Sir, Vertue, if not in action, is a vice, And when wee move not forward, we goe backeward; Nor is this peace (the nurse of drones, and cowards) Our health, but a disease. Gasp. VVel urg'd my Lord. Antho. Perfit what is so well begunne. Embas. And binde, My Lord, your servant: Rober. Hare-braind foole! what reason Canst thou inferre to make this good? Bertol. A thousand Not to be contradicted. But consider VVhere your command lies? 'Tis not, Sir, in France, Spaine, Germany, Portugall, but in Sicilie, An Island, Sir. Here are no mines of gold, Or silver to enrich you, no worme spinnes Silke in her wombe to make distinction Betweene you, and a Peasant, in your habits. No fish liues neere our shores, who's blood can dy Scarlet, or purple; all that wee possesse VVith beasts, wee have in common: Nature did Designe us to be warriours, and to breake through Our ring the sea, by which we are inviron'd; And we by force must fetch in what is wanting, Or precious to us. Adde to this, wee are A populous nation, and increase so fast, That if we by our providence, are not sent Abroad in colonies, or fall by the sword, Not Sicilie (though now, it were more fruitfull, Then when 'twas stil'd the granary of great Rome) Can yeeld our numerous frie bread, we must starve, Or eat vp one another. Adorn. The King heares With much attention. Astut. And seemes mou'd with what Bertoldo hath deliver'd. Bertol. May you live long, Sir, The King of peace, so you deny not us The glory of the warre; let not our nerves Shrincke up with sloth, nor for want of imployment Make younger brothers theves; 'tis their swordes, Sir, Must sow and reape their harvest; if examples May move you more then arguments, looke on England, The Empresse of the European Isles, And unto whom alone ours yeelds precedence, When did she flourish so, as when she was The Mistresse of the Ocean. Her navies Putting a girdle round about the world, When the Iberian quak'd, her worthies nam'd; And the faire flowre Deluca grew pale, set by The red Rose and the white: let not our armour Hung up, or our unrig'd Armada make us Ridiculous to the late poore snakes our neighbours VVarm'd in our bosomes, and to whom againe VVe may be terrible: while wee spend our houres Without variety, confinde to drinke, Dice, Cards, or whores. Rowze us, Sir, from the sleepe Of idlenesse, and redeeme our morgag'd honours. Your birth, and justly, claimes my fathers Kingdome; But his Heroique minde descends to mee, I will confirme so much. Adorn. In his lookes he seemes To breake ope Ianus Temple. Astut. How these younglings Take fire from him! Ador. It works an alteration Vpon the King. Antho. I can forbeare no longer: Warre, warre, my Soveraigne. Fulg. The King appeares Resolv'd, and does preapare to speake. Robert. Thinke not Our counsel's built upon so weake a base, As to be overturn'd, or shaken with Tempestuous windes of words. As I, my Lord, Before resolv'd you, I will not ingage My person in this quarrell; neyther presse My Subjects to maintaine it: yet to shew My rule is gentle, and that I have feeling Of your Masters sufferings, since these Gallants weary Of the happinesse of peace, desire to taste The bitter sweets of warre, wee doe consent That as Adventures, and Voluntiers (No way compell'd by us) they may make tryall Of their boasted valours. Bertol. Wee desire no more. Robert. 'Tis well, and but my grant in this, expect not Assistance from mee. Governe as you please The Province you make choice of, for I vow. By all things sacred, if that thou miscarry In this rash undertaking, I will heare it No otherwise then as a sad disaster, Falne on a stranger: nor will I esteeme That man my Subject, who in thy extremes In purse or person ayds thee. Take your fortune: You know mee, I haue said it. So my Lord You have my absolute answer. Embas. My Prince payes In me his duty. Robert. Follow me, Fulgentio, And you, Astutio. Exeunt Roberto, Fulgentio, Astutio attendants. Gasp. VVhat a frowne he threw At his departure, on you. Bertol. Let him keepe His smiles for his state Catamite, I care not. Antho. Shall wee aboord to night? Embas. Your speed, my Lord, Doubles the benefit. Bertol. I have a businesse Requires dispatch, some two houres hence I'll meet you. Exeunt. Scene. II. Signior Sylli. walking fantastically before, followed by Camiola and Clarinda: Camiola. Nay Signior, this is too much ceremony in my owne house. Sylli. VVhat's gratious abroad, must be in private practis'd. Clar. For your mirth-sake Let him alone, he has beene all this morning In practice with a perugd Gentleman vsher, To teach him his true amble and his postures, Sylli walking by, and practising his postures. VVhen he walkes before a Lady Syll. You may, Madame, Perhaps, beleeve that I in this use art, To make you dote upon mee by exposing My more then most rare features to your view. But I as I have ever done, deale simply, A marke of sweet simplicity ever noted I'the family of the Syllies. Therefore Lady, Looke not with too much contemplation on mee, If you doe, you are i'the suds. Camil. You are no Barber? Sylli. Fie no, not I, but my good parts have drawne More loving hearts out of faire Ladies bellies, Then the whole trade haue done teeth. Cam. Is't possible? Sylli. Yes, and they live too, marry much condoling The scorne of their Narcissus, as they call mee, Because I love my selfe. Cam. VVithout a rivall; What philtres or love-powders doe you use To force affection? I see nothing in Your person, but I dare looke on, yet keepe My owne poore heart still. Sylli. You are warn'd, be arm'd, And doe not lose the hope of such a husband In being too soone enamour'd. Clar. Hold in your head, Or you must haue a martingale. Sylli: I have sworne Neuer to take a wife, but such a one (O may your Ladiship prove so strong) as can Hold out a moneth against mee. Cam Never feare it, Though your best taking part, your wealth were trebl'd I would not wooe you. But since in your pitty You please to give me caution, tell me what Temptations I must flye from? Sylli. The first is That you never heare mee sing, for I am a Syri. If you observe, when I warble, the dogs howle As ravish'd with my D tties, and you will runne mad to heare mee. Cam. I will stop my eares, And keepe my little wits. Sylli. Next when I dance And come aloft thus, cast not a sheepes eye Vpon the quivering of my calfe. Cam. Proceed, Sir, Sylli. But on no termes, for 'tis a maine point, dreame not Of the strength of my back, though it will beare a burthen With any porter. Cami. I meane not to ride you, Cam. Nor I your little Ladiship, 'till you have Perform'd the Covenants. Be not taken with My prettie spider fingers, nor my eyes, That twinckle on both sides. Cami. Was there ever such One knocks. A piece of motlie heard of! who's that? you may spare The Catalogue of my dangers. Exit Clarinda. Syl. No good Madam, I have not told you halfe. Cami. Enough good Signior, If I eate more of such sweete meats, I shall surfet. Who is't? Enter Clarinda. Clar. The brother of the King. Syl. Nay start not, The brother of the King! is he no more? Were it the King himselfe, I'll give him leave To speake his mind to you, for I am not jealous, And to assure your Ladyship of so much, I'll usher him in, and that done, hide my selfe. Exit Syl. Cami. Camiola if ever, now be constant This is indeed a sutor, whose sweet presence, Courtship and loving language would have stagger'd The chast Penelope. And to increase The wonder, did not modestie forbid it I should aske that from him, he sues to me for; And yet my reason like a tyran, tells me I must nor give, nor take it. Syl. I must tell you Enter Sylli, and Bertoldo. You loose your labour. 'Tis enough to prove it, Signior Sylli came before you, and you know First come first seru'd yet you shall have my countenance To parley with her and I'l take speciall care That none shall interrupt you Ber. You are courteous. Syl. Come wench wilt thou heare wisedome? Clar. Yes from you Sr. Steps aside kisseth her. Ber. If forcing this sweet favour from your lips Faire Madam, argue me of too much boldnesse When you are pleas'd to understand, I take A parting kisse, if not excuse, at least 'Twill qualifie the offence. Cami. A parting kisse Sr.? What Nation envious of the happinesse Which Sicilie enjoyes in your sweet presence, Can buy you from her? or what Climate yeeld Pleasures transcending those which you injoy here, Being both belou'd and honor'd. The North-star And guider of all hearts, and to summe up Your full accompt of happinesse, in a word, The brother of the King. Ber. Doe you alone, And with an unexampl'd cruelty, Inforce my absence, and deprive me of Those blessings, which you with a polish'd phrase Seeme to insinuate, that I doe possesse, And yet tax me as being guilty of My wilfull exile? what are Titles to me? Or popular suffrage? or my neerenesse to The King in blood? or fruitfull Sicilie, Though it confess'd no Soveraigne but my selfe, When you that ate the essence of my being. The anchor of my hopes; the reall substance Of my felicity, in your disdaine Turne all to fading and deceiving shaddowes? Cami. You tax me without cause. Ber. You must confesse it. But answer love with love, and seale the contract In the vniting of our soules, how gladly (though now I were in action, and assur'd, Following my fortune; that plum'd victory Would make her glorious stand upon my tent) Would I put off my armour, in my heate Of conquest, and like Anthonie pursue My Cleopatra! will you yet looke on me With an eye of Favour? Cami. Truth beare witnesse for me, That in the Iudgement of my Soule, you are A man so absolute, and circular In all those wish'd-for rarities, that may take A Virgin captive, that though at this instant All sceptr'd Monarches of our Westerne world Were rivalls with you, and Camiola worthy Of such a competition, you alone Should weare the ghirlond. Ber. If so, what diverts Your Favour from me? Cami. No mulct in your selfe, Or in your person, mind or fortune. Ber. What then? Cami. The Consciousnesse of mine owne wants. Alas Sr. We are not parallells, but like lines divided Can nere meete in one Centre, your Birth Sir (Without addition) were an ample Dowrie For one of fairer Fortunes, and this shape, Were you ignoble, far above all value; To this, so cleare a mind, so furnish'd with Harmonious faculties, moulded from heaven, That though you were Thersites in your features Of no descent, and Irus in your fortunes, Ulisses like you would force all eyes, and eares To love, but seene, and when heard, wonder at Your matchlesse story. But all these bound up Together in one Volume, give me leave With admiration to looke upon 'em, But not presume in my owne flattering hopes, I may or can injoy 'em. Ber. How you ruine. What you would seeme to build up! I know no Disparitie betweene vs, you are an heyre Sprung from a noble familie, faire, rich, young, And every way my equall. Cami. Sir excuse me, One aerie with proportion, nere discloses The eagle and the wren tissue, and freese In the same garment monstrous: But suppose That what's in you excessive, were diminish'd, And my desert supply'd, the strongest bar, Religion stops our Entrance, you are Sir A Knight of Malta, by your order bound To a single life, you cannot marrie me, And I assure my selfe you are too noble To seek me (though my frailtie should consent) In a base path. Ber. A dispensation Lady Will easiely absolve me. Cami. O take heed Sr. When, what is vow'd to heaven, is dispens'd with, To serve our ends on earth, a curse must follow, And not a blessing. Ber. Is there no hope left me? Cam. Nor to my selfe, but is a neighbour to Impossibility: true love should walke On equall feete, in vs it does not Sir. But rest assur'd, excepting this, I shall be Devoted to your service. Ber. And this is your Determinate sentence? Cami. Not to be revok'd. Ber. Farewell then fairest cruell. All thoughts in me Of Women perish. Let the glorious light Of noble war extinguish loves dimne taper That onely lends me light to see my follie; Honor, be thou my everliving Mistresse, And fond affection as thy bond-slave serve thee. Exit Ber: Cam. How soone my Sun is set: He being absent, Never to rise againe! what a fierce battaile Is fought betweene my passions! me thinkes We should haue kiss'd at parting. Syl. I perceive. He has his answer, now must I step in To comfort her, you have found, I hope, sweet Lady, Some difference between a youth of my pitch, And this bug-beare Bertoldo, men are men, The Kings brother is no more: good parts will doe it, When Titles faile, despaire not, I may be In time intreated. Cam. Be so now to leave mee, Lights for my chamber, O my heart! Exeunt Camiola, &amp; Clarinda. Sylli. She now I know is going to bed to ruminate Which way to glut her selfe upon my person, But for my o th-sake I will keepe her hungry, And to grow full my selfe, I'll straight to supper. Exit.

Astutio. 'Twas strange! Roberto. Are we growne so contemptible? Fulgentio. 'Tis far from me Sir, to adde fuell to your anger, That in your ill opinion of him, burnes Too hot already, else I should affirme It was a grosse neglect. Roberto. A wilfull scorne Of duty and alleageance, you giue it Too faire a name. But we shall think on't: can you Guesse what the numbers were that follow'd him In his desperate action? Roberto. More then you thinke, Sir. All ill affected spirits in Palermo, Or to your government, or person, with The turbulent sword-men, such whose poverty forc'd 'em To wish a change, are gone along with him; Creatures devoted to his undertakings In right or wrong, and to expresse their zeale, And readinesse to serve him, ere they went Prophanely tooke the sacrament on their knees, To live and dye with him. Roberto. O most impious! their loyalty to us forgot? Fulgent. I feare so. Astut. Vnthankfull as they are. Fulgen. Yet this deserves not One troubled thought in you, Sir, with your pardon I hold that their remove from hence makes more For your security, then danger. Roberto. True; and as I'll fashion it, they shall feele it too. Astutio, you shall presently be dispatch'd With letters writ, and sign'd with our owne hand, To the Duchesse of Siena, in excuse Of these forces sent against her. If you spare An oath to give it credit, that, wee never Consented to it, swearing for the King, Though false, it is no perjury. Astut. I know it. They are not fit to be state agents, Sir, That without scruple of their conscience, cannot Be prodigall in such trifles. Fulgentio. Right, Astutio. Roberto. You must beside from us take some instructions To be imparted, as you judge 'em usefull, To the Generall Gonzaga. Instantly Prepare you for your journey. Astut. With the wings Of loyalty and duty.

So melancholy say you? Clar. Never given To such retirement. Adorn. Can you guesse the cause? Clar. If it hath not it's birth, and being from The brave Bertoldo's absence, I confesse It is pass'd my apprehension. Sylli. You are wide, The whole field wide. I in my understanding Pitty your ignorance: yet if you will Sweare to conceale it, I will let you know VVhere her shooe ringes her. Clar. I vow, Signior, By my virginity. Sylli. A perillous oath In a waiting woman of fifteene, and is indeed A Kinde of nothing. Adorn. I'll take one of something If you please to minister it. Sylli. Nay, you shall not sweare, I had rather take your word, for should you vow: Damne mee, I'll doe this, you are sure to breake. Adorn. I thanke you Signior, but resolve us. Sylli. Know then, Here walkes the cause. She dares not looke upon me, My beauties are so terrible, and inchaunting, Shee cannot endure my sight. Adorn. There I believe you. Sylli. But the time will come, be comforted, when I will Put off this vizor of unkindnesse to her, And shew an amorous, and yeelding face: And vntill then, though Hercules himselfe Desire to see her, hee had better eate His clubbe then passe her threshold, for I'll be Her Cerberus to guard her.

Disemboge! I talke of Hercules, and here is one Bound up in decimo sexto. Pag. Answer wretch. Syl. Pray you little gentleman, be not so furious, The Lady keepes her chamber. Pag. And we present? Sent in an Embassie to her? But here is Her gentlewoman, Sirrah hold my cloake, While I take a leape at her lips, do it and neatly; Or having first tripp'd up thy heeles, I'll make Thy backe my footstoole. Page kisses Clar. Syl. Tamberlaine in little! Am I turn'd Turke! what an office am I put to! Cla. My Lady, gentle youth is indispos'd. Pag. Though she were dead and buried, only tell her, The great man in the Court, the brave Fulgentio Descends to visit her, and it will raise her Out of the grave for joy. Enter Fulgen. Syl. Here comes another! The divell I feare in his holi-day clothes. Pag. So soone, My part is at an end then, cover my shoulders, When I grow great, thou shalt serve me. Fulgen. Are you Sirrah An implement of the house? Syl. Sure he will make A joynes-stoole of me! Fulgen. Or if you belong To the Lady of the place, command her hither. Adorn. I do not weare her livery, yet acknowledge A duty to her. And as little bound To serve your peremptorie will, as she is To obey your summons.

Not so Sir, However in his life, he had dependance Vpon my Father, He is a gentleman As well borne as your selfe. Put on your hat. Fulgen. In my presence, without leaue? Syl. He has mine Madam? Cam. And I must tell you Sir, and in plaine language, How e'r your glittring out-side promise gentry, The rudenesse of your carriage and behaviour Speakes you a couser thing. Syl. She meanes a clowne Sr. I am her interpreter for want of a better. Cam. I am a Queene in mine owne house, nor must you Expect an Empire here. Syl. Sure I must love her Before the day, the prettie Soule's so valiant. Cami. What are you? and what would you with me? Fulgen. Proud one, When you know what I am, and what I came for, And may on your submission proceed so, You in your reason must repent the coursenesse Of my entertainement. Cami. Why fine man? what are you? Fulgen. A kinsman of the Kings. Cam. I cry you mercy, For his sake, not your owne. But grant you are so, 'Tis not impossible, but a king may have A foole to his kinsman, no way meaning you Sir. Fulgen. You have heard of Fulgen. Cam. Long since Sir, A suit-broker in Court. He has the worst Report among good men I ever heard of, For briberie and extortion. In their prayers Widdowes and Orphans curse him for a canker, And caterpiller in the state. I hope Sir, You are not the man, much lesse imploy'd by him As a smocke-agent to me. Fulgen. I reply not As you deserve, being assur'd you know me, Pretending ignorance of my person, onely To give me a tast of your wit; 'Tis well and courtly, I like a sharpe wit well. Syl. I cannot indure it, Nor any of the Syllies. Fulgen. More I know too, This harsh induction must serve as a foyle To the well tun'd observance and respect, You will hereafter pay me, being made Familiar with my credit with the King, And that, containe your joy, I daine to love you. Cam. Love me? I am not rap'd with't. Ful. Hear't againe. I love you honestly, now you admire me. Cam. I doe indeed, it being a word so seldome Heard from a courtiers mouth. But pray you deale plainly, Since you finde me simple. what might be the motives Inducing you to leave the freedome of A batchelers life, on your soft necke to weare The stubborne yoake of marriage? And of all The beauties in Palermo, to choose me, Poore me? that is the maine point you must treate of. Ful. Why I will tell you. Of a little thing You are a prettle peate, indifferenly faire too; And like a new-rigg'd shippe both tite, and y'are Well truss'd to beare. Virgins of Gyant size Are fluggards at the sport: but for my pleasure, Give me a neat well timbred gamster like you, Such neede no spurres, the quickenes of your eye Assures an active spirit. Cam. You are pleasant Sir, Yet I presume, that there was one thing in me Vnmention'd yet, that tooke you more then all Those parts you have remembred. Fulgen. What? Cam. My wealth Sir. Fulgen. You are i'the right, without that beautie is A flower worne in the morning, at night trod on. But beautie, youth, and fortune meeting in you, I will vouchsafe to marrie you. Cam. You speake well, And in returne excuse me Sir, if I Deliver reasons why upon no tearmes I'll marrie you, I fable not. Syl. I am glad To heare this, I began to have an ague. Fulgen. Come, your wise reasons. Cam. Such as they are, pray you take them. First I am doubtfull whether you are a man, Since for your shape trimmd up in a Ladies dressing You might passe for a woman: now I love To deale on certainties. And for the fairenes Of your complexion, which you thinke will take me, The colour I must tell you in a man Is weake and faint, and never will hold out If put to labour, giue me the lovely browne. A thicke curl'd hayre of the same dye; broad shoulders, A brawnie arme full of veines, a legge without An artificiall calfe, I suspect yours, But let that passe. Syl. She meanes me all this while, For I have every one of those good parts, O Sylli, fortunate Sylli! Cami. You are mov'd Sir. Fulgen. Fie no, go on. Cami. Then as you are a courtier; A grac'd one too, I feare you have beene too forward, And so much for your person. Rich you are, Divelish rich, as 'tis reported, and sure have The aides of Satans little fiends to get it, And what is got upon his backe, must be Spent you know where, the proverb's sta'e, one word more And I have done. Fulgen. I'll ease you of the trouble, Coy, and disdainefull. Cam. Save me, or else he'll beat me. Fulg. No, your owne folly shall, and since you put mee To my last charme, look upon this, and tremble. Cam. At the sight of a faire ring? the Kings, I take it. I have seene him weare the like; if he hath sent it Shewes the Kings ring. as a favour to mee. Fulg. Yes, 'tis verie likely, His dying mothers gift, priz'd at his crowne, By this hee does command you to be mine, By his gift you are so: you may yet redeme all. Cam. You are in a wrong account still. Though the King may Dispose of my life and goods, my mind's mine owne, And shall be never yours. The King (Heaven blesse him) Is good and gracious, and being in himselfe Abstemious from base and goatish loosenesse, Will not compell against their wills, chaste Madiens, To dance in his magnious circles. I believe Forgetting it, when he washed his hands, you stole it With an intent to awe me. But you are coozin'd. I am still my selfe, and will be. Fulg. A proud haggard, And not to be reclaim'd, which of your groomes, Your coach-man, foole, or foot-man, ministers Night phisicque to you? Cam. You are foule-mouth'd, Fulg. Much fairer Then thy blacke soule, and so I will proclaime thee. Cam. Were I a man, thou durst not speake this. Fulg. Heav'n So prosper mee, as I resolve to doe it To all men, and in every place, scorch'd by A tit of pen-pence? Exit Fulgentio and his Page. Sylli. Now I begin to be valiant Nay, I will draw my sword. O for a butcher! Doe a friends part, pray you carry him the length of't. I give him three yeeres, and a day to match my Toledo. And then wee'll fight like Dragons. Adorn. Pray have patience. Cam. I may live to have vengeance; My Bertoldo Would not have heard this. Adorn. Madam. Cam. 'Pray you spare Your language; Pre'thee foole, and make me merry: Sylli. That is my Office ever. Adorn. I must doe, Not talke, this glorious gallant shall heare from me. Exeunt. Scene. III. The chambers discharg'd: A flourish, as to an assault. Gonzaga, Pierio, Roderigo, Iacomo, Souldiers Gonzaga. Is the breach made assaultable? Pierio. Yes, and the moate Fill'd up, the Canonier hath don his parts, We may enter six a brest. Roderig. There's not a man Dares shew himselfe upon the wall. Facom. Defeate not The souldiers hop'd-for spoile. Pier. If you, Sir, Delay the assault, and the Citie be given up To your discretion, you in honour cannot Vse the extremitie of warre, but in Compassion to 'em, you to us prove cruell. Iacom. And an enemy to your selfe. Roder. A hindrance to The brave revenge you have vow'd Gonz. Temper your heat, And loose not by too sudden rashnesse, tha Which be but patient, will be offer'd to you Security ushers ruine; proud contempt Of an enemy three parts vanquish'd with desire And greedinesse of spoyle, have often wrested A certaine victory from the Conquerours gripe, Discretion is the tutor of the warre, Valour the pupill, and when we command With lenity and your directions follow'd With cheerefulnesse, a prosperous end must crowne Our workes well undertaken. Roderig. Ours are finish'd Pier. If we make use of fortune. Gonz. Her false smiles Deprive you of your judgements. The condition Of our affaires exacts a double care, And like bifronted Ianus, wee must looke Backward, as forward: though a flattering calme Bids us urge on, a sudden tempest rais'd, Not fear'd, much lesse expected, in our reere May foully fall upon us, and distract us. To our confusion. Our scout! what brings Enter Scout. Thy ghastly lookes, and sudden speede? Scout. Th'assurance Of a new enemy. Gonz. This I fore-saw, and fear'd. What are they, know'st thou? Scout. They are by their colours Sicilians, bravely mounted, and the brightness Of their rich armours doubly guilded with Reflection of the Sunne. Gonz. From Sicilie? The King in league! no warre proclaimed ! 'tis foule, But this must be prevented, not disputed Ha, how is this? your Estridge plumes, that but E'n now like quills of Porcupines seem'd to threaten The staires, drop at the rumor of a shower? And like to captive colours sweep the earth? Beare up, but in great dangers, greater mindes Are neuer proud. Shall a few loose troopes untrain'd But in a customary ostentation, Presented as a sacrifice to your valours Cause a dejection in you? Pier. No dejection. Rod. However startl'd, where you lead, we'll follow Gon. 'Tis bravely said. We will not stay their charge, But meet 'em man to man, and horse to horse. Pierio our absence hold our place, And with our foot-men, and those, sickely troupes, Prevent a sally. I in mine owne person, With part of the cavallery, will bid, These hunters welcome to a bloody breakefast, But I lose time. Pier. I'll to my charge. Exit Pierio. Gonz. And wee To ours. I'll bring you on. Iacom. If we come off It is not amisse, if not, my state is settl'd Exeunt, alarme. Scene. IIII. Ferdinand. Druso. Livio. above. Far. No aydes from Sicilie? Hath hope forsooke us? And that vaine comfort to affliction, pitty By our vow'd friend deni'd us? we can not live, Nor die with honor: like beasts in a toyle Wee waite the leasure of the bloody hunter, Who is not so farre reconcil'd unto us, As in one death to give a period To our calamities, but in delaying The fate wee cannot flie from, starv'd with wants, Wee die this night to live againe to morrow, And suffer greater torments. Druso. There is not Three dayes provision for every soldiour, At an ounce of bread a day left in the Citty. Liv. To dye the beggers death with hunger, made Anatomies while we live, cannot but cracke Our heart-strings with vexation. Ferd. Would they would breake, Breake altogether, how willingly like Cato Could I teare out my bowells, rather then Looke on the conquerours insulting face, But that religion, and the horrid dreame To be suffer'd in the other world denyes it. What newes with thee? Enter Souldier. Soul. From the turret of the fort By the rising clouds of dust, through which, like lightning The spendor of bright armes sometimes brake through, I did descry some forces making towards us, And from the campe, as emulous of their glory, The Generall, (for I know him by his horse) But bravely seconded. encounter'd 'em. Their greetings were to rough for friends, their swords And not their tongues exchanging courtesies. By this the maine Batralias are joyn'd, And if you please to be spectators of The horrid issue, I will bring you where As in a Theater you may see their fates In purple gore presented. Ferd. Heaven, If yet Thou art appeas'd for my wrong done to Aurelia, Take pitty of my miseries. Lead the way, friend. Scene. V. A long charge after a Flourish for Victory. Gonzaga. Iacomo. Roderigo wounded. Bertoldo. Gasparo. Anthonio Prisoners. Gonz. VVe have 'em yet, though they cost vs deer. This was Charg'd home, and bravely follow'd. Be to your selves True mirrors to each others worth, and looking With noble Emulation on his wounds, (The glorious Livery of triumphant war) To Iacomo and Roderigo. Imagine these with equall grace appeare Vpon your selfe. The bloody swsat you have suffer'd In this laborious, nay toylesome harvest, Yeelds a rich crop of conquest, and the spoyle Most precious balsum to a souldies hurts Will ease and cure 'em. Let me looke upon To Gasparo and Anthon. The prisones faces. O how much transform'd From what they were. O Mars! were these toyes fashion'd To undergoe the burthen of thy service? The weight of their defensive armor bruiz'd Their weak, effeminate limbes, and would have forc'd em In a hot day without a blow to yeeld. Antho. This insultation shewes not manly in you. Gonz. To men I had forborne it, you are women, Or at the best loose carpet knights, what fury Seduc'd you to exchange your ease in Court For labour in the field? Perhaps you thought, To charge through dust, and blood, an armed foe, Was but like gracefull running at the ring For a wanton mistrisse glove, and encounter A soft impression on her lips. But you Are gawdie butterflies, and I wrong my selfe In parling with you. Gaspa. Ua victis. Now we prove it. Rod. But here's one fashion'd in another mould, And made of tougher mettall. Gonz. True, I owe him For this wound bravely given. Ber. O that mountaines Were heap'd upon me, that I might expire A wretch no more remembred. Gonz. Look up Sr. To be orecome deserves no shame. If you Had falne ingloriously, or could accuse Your want of courage in resistance, 'twere To be lamented: But since you perform'd As much as could be hop'd for from a man, (Fortune his enemy) you wrong your selfe In this direction, I am honor'd in My victory ore you: but to have these My prisoners, is in my true judgement rather, Captivitie then a triumph; you shall finde Faire quarter from me, and your many wounds (Which I hope are not mortall) with such care Lookt to, and cur'd, as if your nearest friend Attended on you. Ber. When you know me better You will make void this promise: Can you call me Into your memory. Gonz. The brave Bertoldo! A brother of our order! By Saint Iohn, (our holy patron) I am more amaz'd, Nay thunder strooke, with thy Apostacy, And prÃ¦cipice, from the most solemne vowes Made vnto heaven, when this, the glorious badge Of our redeemer was conferr'd upon thee, By the great master, then if I had seene A reprobate Iew, an Atheist, Turke, or Tartar Baptiz'd in our religion. Ber. This I look'd for, And am resolv'd to suffer. Gon. Fellow Souldiers. Behold this man, and taught by his example Know that 'tis safer far to play with lightning, Then trifle in things sacred. In my rag Weepes. I shed these at the funerall of his vertue, Faith and religion; why I will tell you He was a gentleman, so trayn'd up, and fashion'd For noble uses, and his youth did promise Such certainties, more then hopes, of great atchievments, As if the Christian world had stood oppos'd Against the Ottoman race to trie the fortune Of one encounter, this Bertoldo had beene For his knowledge to direct, and matchles courage To execute, without a rivall, by The votes of good men chosen generall, As the prime souldier, and most deserving, Of all that weare the crosse, which now in justice I thus teare from him. Ber. Let me dye with it, Vpon my breast. Gonz. No, by this thou wer't sworne On all occasions, as a knight to guard Weake Ladies from oppression, and never To draw thy sword against 'em, where as thou In hope of gaine or glory, when a Princesse And such a Princesse as Aurelia is, Was dispossess'd by violence, of what was Her true inheritance, against thine oth, Hast to thy uttermost labour'd to uphold Her falling enemie. But thou shalt pay A heavy forfeiture, and learne too late, Valour, imploy'd in an ill quarrell, turnes To cowardice, and vertve then puts on Foule vices vizard. This is that which cancells All friendships bands between vs Beare 'em off I will heare no replie. And let the ransome Of these, for they are yours, be highly rated. In this I doe but right, and let it be Stil'd justice, and not wilfull cruelty. Exeunt. The end of the second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. III. Scene. I. Gonzaga, Astutio, Roderigo, Iacomo. Gonzaga. VVhat I have done Sr by the law of armes I can, and will make good. Astutio. I have no commission To expostulate the act. These letters speake The King my Masters love to you, and his vow'd service to the Duchesse, on whose person I am to giue attendance. Gonz. At this instant. Shee's at Pienza; you may spare the trouble Of riding thither: I have advertized her Of our successe, and on what humble termes Siena stands: though presently I can Possesse it deferre it, that shee may Enter her owne, and as she please dispose of The prisoners and the spoyle. Astut. I thanke you, Sir. I'the meane time, if I may have your licence, I have a Nephew, and one once my ward For whose liberties and ransomes, I would gladly Make composition. Gonz. They are, as I take it. Call'd Gasparo, and Anthonio, Astut. The same, Sir. Gonz. For them you must treat with these, but for Bertoldo, He is mine owne, if the King will ransom him, He payes downe fifty thousand crownes, if not He liues, and dies my slave, Astut. Pray you a word. The King will rather thanke you to detaine him, Then give one crowne to free him. Gonz. At his pleasure. I'll send the prisoners under guard, my businesse Calls me another way. Exit Gonzaga. Astut. My service waits you, Now Gentlemen do not deale like Merchants with me, But noble Captaines, you know in great mindes Posse, &amp; nolle nobile. Rod. Pray you speake Our language. Iacom. I finde not in my commission An officers bound to speake or understand More then his Mother tongue. Roder. If hee speake that After midnight 'tis remarkable. Astu. In plaine termes then, Anthonio is your prisoner. Gasparo yours Iacom. You are i'the right. Astu. At what summe doe you rate Their severall ransomes. Rod. I must make my market As the commodity cost me. Astut. As it cost you? You did not buy your Captainship? your desert I hope advanc'd you. Rod. How? it well appeares You are no souldier. Desert in these daies? Desert may make a Serieant to a Colonel, And it may hinder him from rising higher, But if it ever get a company, A company, pray you marke mee, without money Or private seruice done for the Generalls Mistresse, With a commendatory Epistle from her, I will turne Lansprizadoe. Iacom. Pray you observe, Sir: I serv'd two prenticeships, just foureteene yeere, Trayling the puissant pike; and halfe so long Had the right hand file, and I fought well, 'twas said too: But I might have serv'd, and fought, and serv'd til doomsday And never have carryed a flagge, but for the legacy A buxsome widdow of threescore, bequeath'd mee, And that too, my backe knowes, I labour hard for, But was better paid. Astut. You are merry with your selves But this is from the purpose. Roder. To the point then. Prisoners are not tane every day, and when We have 'em we must make the best use of 'em. Our pay is little to the part we should beare, And that so long a comming, that 'tis spent Before we have it, and hardly wipes off scores At the Taverne, and the Ordinary. Iacom. You may adde to Our sport tooke up on trust. Roder. Peace, thou smocke vermin. Discover commanders, secrets! In a word, Sir, We have requir'd, and find our prisoners rich: Two thousand crownes a piece, our companies cost vs, And so much each of us will have, and that In present pay. Iacom. It is too little; yet Since you haue said the word, I am content, But will not goe a gazet lesse. Astut. Since you are not To be brought lower, there is no evading I'll be your pay-master. Roder. Wee desire no better. Astut. But not a word of what's agreed between us, 'Till I have schoold my gallants. Iacom. I am dumb, Sir. Enter a guard: Bertoldo, Anthonio, Gaspero, in yrons. Bert. And where remov'd now? hath the Tyrant found out Worse usage for us? Antho. VVorse it cannot be. My grewhound has fresh straw, and scraps in his kennell, But wee have neyther. Gasp. Did I ever thinke To weare such garters on silke stockings? or That my too curious appetite, that turn'd At the sight of godwits, pheasant, partidge, quales Larkes, wood-cocks, caluerd sammon, as course diet, Would leape at a mouldy crust? Antho. And goe without it; So oft as I doe, O how haue I jeer'd The City entertainment. A huge shoulder Of glorious fat Ramme Mutton, seconded With a paire of tame cats, or conies, a crabbe tart With a worthy loyne of veale, and valiant Capon, Mortifi'd to grow tender. These I scorn'd From their plentifull horne of abundance, though invited: But now I could carry my owne stoole to a tripe, And call their chitterlings charity, and blesse the founder. Bertol. O that I were no farther sensible Of my miseries then you are! you like beasts Feele onely stings of hunger, and complaine not But when you are empty: but your narrow soules (If you have any) cannot comprehend How insupportable the torments are, Which a free and noble soule made captiue, suffers: Most miserable men! and what am I then, That enuy you? Fetters though made of gold, Expresse base thraldome and all delicates Prepar'd by Median cookes for Epicures, When not our owne, are bitter quilts fill'd high With gossamire and roses, cannot yeeld The body soft repose, the mind kep't waking With anguish and affliction. Astut. My good Lord. Ber. This is no time, nor place for flaterry Sir, Pray you stile me as I am, a wretch forsaken Of the world, as my selfe. Astut. I would it were In me to helpe you. Ber. I if that you want power Sir, Lip comfort cannot cure me, pray you leave mee To mine owne private thoughts. Astu. My valiant Nephew! walkes by. And my more then warlike-ward! I am glad to see you After your glorious conquests. Are these chaines Rewardee for your good service? If they are You should weare 'em on your necks (since they are massie) Like Aldermen of the war. Antho. You jeere us to! Gasp. Good uncle name not (as you are a man of honor) That fatall word of war, the very founde of't Is more dreadfull then a Cannon. Antho. But redeeme us From this Captivitie, and I'll vow hereafter Never to weare a sword, or cut my meate With a knife, that has an edge or point. I'll starve first Gasp. I will crie broome or cats meate in Palermo; Turne porter, carrie burthens; any thing, Rather then live a souldier. Astut. This should have Beene thought upon before. At what price thinke you Your two wise heads are rated? Antho. A calves head is More worth then mine, I am sure it had more braines in't Or I had never come here. Roder. And I will eate it With bacon, if I have not speedy ransome. Ant. And a little garlick too, for your own sake Sir Twill boyle in your stomacke else. Gasp. Beware of mine Or the hornes may choake you. I am married Sir. Antho. You shall have my row of houses neare the pallace Gasp. And my villa all. Antho. All that we have. To Astutio. Astut. Well, have more wit hereafter For this time you are ransom'd. Iacom. Off with their irons. Rod. Do do If you are ours again, you know your price. Antho. Pray you dispatch us: I shall nere beleeve I am a freeman, till I set my foote In Sicilie agen, and drinke Palermo, And in Palermo too. Astut. The wind sits faire, You shall aboord to night with the rising Sun You may touch upon the coast. But take your leaves Of the late Generall first. Gasp. I will be briefe. Antho. And I, my lord heaven keepe you. Gasp. Yours to use In the way of peace, but as your souldiers never. Antho. A pox of war no more of war. Ber. Have you Exeunt Roderig. Iaco. Anthonio. Gasparo. Authority to loose their bonds, yet leave The brother of your King, whose worth disdaines Comparison with such as these, in irons? If ransome may redeeme them, I have landes, A patrimony of mine owne assign'd me, By my deceased sire to satisfie What ere can be demanded for my freedome. Astut. I wish you had Sir, but the king who yeelds No reason for his will, in his displeasure Hath seas'd on all you had; nor will Gonzaga, Whose prisoner now you are, accept of lesse Then fiftie thousand crownes. Ber. I finde it now That misery nere comes alone. But grant The King is yet inexorable, time May worke him to a feeling of my sufferings. I have friends, that swore their lives and fortunes were At my devotion, and among the rest Your selfe my lord, when forfeited to the Law For a foule murther, and in cold blood done, I made your life my gift, and reconcil'd you To this incensed king, and got your pardon. Beware ingratitude. I know you are rich And may pay downe the Sum. Astut. I might my lord, But pardon me. Ber. And will Astutio prove then To please a passionate man, the kings no more, False to his maker and his reason? which Commandes more then I aske? Ã´ summer friendship, Whose flattering leaves that shaddowed us in Our prosperity, with the least gust drop off In th'Autumne of adversity! How like A prison is to a grave! when dead we are With solemne Pompe brought thither, and our heires, (Masking their joy in false dissembled teares) Weepe ore the hearse, but earth no sooner covers The earth brought thither, but they turne away With inward smiles, the dead no more remembred. So enter'd in a prison. Astut. My occasions Command me hence my lord. Ber. Pray you leave me, doe; And tell the cruell king, that I will weare These letters 'till my flesh, and they are one Incorporated substance. In my selfe, As in a glasse, I'll looke on humane frailty, And curse the height of Royall blood: since I In being borne neare to Ioue, am neare his thunder. Cedars once shaken with a storme, their owne Exit Astutio. Waight grubs their rootes out. Lead me where you please; I am his, not fortunes martyr, and will dye The great example of his cruelty. Exit cum suis. Scene. II. Adorni. Adorn. He undergoes my challenge, and contemnes it, And threatens me with the late Edict made 'Gainst duellists, then altar cowards flie to. But I that am ingag'd, and nourish in me A higher aime then faire Camiola dreames of, Must not sit down thus. In the court I dare not Attempt him; and in publike, hee's so guarded With a heard of Parasites, Clients fooles and sutors, That a musket cannot reach him, my designes Admit of no delay. This is her birth-day, Which with a fit and due solemnitie Camiola celebrates; and on it, all such As love or serve her, usually present A tributary duty. I'll have something To give, if my intelligence prove true, Shall find acceptance. I am told, neare this grove Fulgentio very morning makes his makets With his petitioners. I may present him With a sharpe petition. Ha, 'tis he: my fate Be ever bless'd for't. Exit Fulgen. Fulgen. Command such as waite me Not to presume at the least for halfe an houre To presse on my rettirements. Page. I will say, Sir, you are at your prayers. Fulg. That will not finde beliefe, Courtiers have something else to do, be gon, Sir, Challeng'd ! 'tis well! and by a grome! still better ! Was this shape made to fight? I have a tongue yet, How e'r no sword to kill him, and what way This morning, I'll resolve of. Exit Fulgentio. Adorn. I shall crosse Your resolution, or suffer for you. Exit Adorni. Scene. III. Camiola: divers servants with presents: Sylli, Clarinda. Sylli. VVhat are all these? Clar. Sevants with serverall presents, And rich ones too. 1. Serv. With her best wishes, Madam, Of many such daies to you, the Lady Petula Presents you with this fanne. 2. Serv. This Diamond From your Aunt Honoria. 3. Serv. This piece of plate From your Vncle, old Vincentio, with your armes Graven upon it. Cam. Good friends they are too. Munificent in their love, and favour to me. Out of my cabinet returne such jewells As this directs you, for your paines; and yours; Nor must you be forgotten. Honour mee With the drinking of a health. 1. Serv. Gold on my life! 2. Serv. She scornes to give base silver. 3. Serv. VVould she had beene Borne every moneth in the yeere! 1. Serv. Moneth? every day. 2. Serv. Shew such another maid. 3. All happinesse wait you. Exeunt Sylli, Clarinda, Servants. Sylli. I'll see your will done. Cam. How, Adorny wounded? Enter Adorni wounded. Ador. A scratch got in your service, else not worth Your observation; I bring not Madame In honour of your birth-day, anticque plate, Or pearle, for which the savage Indian dives Into the bottome of the Sea; nor Diamonds Hewne from steepe rockes with danger: Such as give To those that have what they themselves want, aime at A glad returne with profit: yet despise not My offering at the altar of your favour; Nor let the lownesse of the giver lessen The height of whats presented. Since it is A pretious jewell, almost forfeyted, And dimn'd with clouds of infamy redeem'd And in in its naturall splendor, with addition, Restor'd to the true owner. Cam. How is this? Ador. Not to hold you in suspence, I bring you, Madame, Your wounded reputation cur'd, the sting Of virulent malice, festring your faire name, Pluck'd out and trode on. That proud man, that was Deny'd the honour of your bed, yet durst With his untrue reports, strumpet your fame, Compell'd by mee, hath given himselfe the lye, And in his owne blood wrote it, you may read Fulgentio subscrib'd. Cam. I am amaz'd! Adorn. It does deserve it, Madam. Common service Is fit for hindes, and the reward proportion'd To their conditions. Therefore looke not on mee As a follower of your fathers fortunes, or One that subsists on yours, you frowne! my service Merits not this aspect. Cam. Which of my favours, I might say bounties, hath begot, and nourish'd This more then rude presumption? since you had An itch to try your desperate valour, wherefore Went you not to the warre? couldst thou suppose My innocence could ever fall so low, As to have need of thy rash sword to guard it Against malicious slander? O how much Those Ladies are deceiv'd and cheated, when The clearnesse and integrity of their actions Doe not defend themselves, and stand secure On their owne bases? Such as in a colour Of seeming service give protection to 'em, Betray their owne strengthes. Malice scorn'd, puts out It selfe, but argu'd, gives a kinde of credit To a false accusation. In this This your most memorable service, you beleev'd You did me right, but you have wrong'd mee more In your defence of my undoubted honour, Then false Fulgentio could. Adorn. I am sorry, What Was so well intended, is so ill receiv'd, Yet under your correction you wish'd Ente Clarinda Bertoldo had beene present. Cam. True I did: But he and you, Sir, are not parallells, Nor must you thinke your selfe so. Adorn. I am what You'll please to have mee. Cam. If Bertoldo had Punish'd Fugentio's insolence, it had showne His love to her, whom in his judgement hee Vouchsafe to make his wife. A height I hope Which you dare not aspire to. The same actions Sure not all men alike: but I perceive Repentance in your lookes. For this time leave me I may forgive, perhaps forget your folly, Conceale your selfe till this storme be blowne over. You will be sought for, yet for my estate Gives him her hand to kisse. Can hinder it, shall not suffer in my service. Ador. This is something yet, tho I mist the mark I shot at. Exit Adorni Cam. This Gentleman is of a noble temper. And I too harsh, perhaps in my reproofe, Was I not Clarinda? Clarind. I am not to censure Your actions Madame: but there are a thousand Ladies, and of good fame, in such a cause. Would be proud of such a servant. Cam. It may be; Enter a Servant. Let me offend in this kinde. Why uncall'd for? Serv. The Signiors, Madame, Gasparo and Anthonio, (Selected friends of the renowned Bertoldo) Put a shore this morning. Cam. Without him? Serv. I thinke so. Cam. Never thinke more then. Serv. They have beene at Court. Kiss'd the Kings hand; and there first duties done To him, appeare ambitions to tender To you their second service. Cam. Waite 'em hither. Eexeunt Servant. Feare doe not racke me, reason, now if ever, Haste with thy ayds, and tell me such a wonder, As my Bertoldo is, with such care fashion'd, Enter Anthonio. Gasparo. Serv. Must not, nay cannot, in hev'ns providence, So soone miscarry; pray you forbeare, ere you Take the priviledge, as strangers to salute mee, (Excuse my manners) make me first understand, How it is with Bertoldo? Ber. The relation Will not I feare deserve your thankes. Antho. I wish Some other should informe you. Cami, Is she dead? You see, though with some feare, I dare enquire it. Gasp. Dead! Would that were the worst, a debt were pay'd then, Kings in their birth owe nature. Cami. Is there ought More terrible then death? Antho. Yes to a spirit Like his. Cruell imprisonment, and that Without the hope of freedome. Cami. You abuse me, The royall King cannot in love to vertue, (Though all springs of affection were dri'd up) But pay his ransome. Gasp. When you know what 'tis You will thinke otherwise; No lesse will do it Then fifty thousand crownes. Cam. A prettie sum, The price waigh'd, with the purchase, 50. thousand? To the King 'tis nothing. He that can spare more To his minion for a masque, cannot but ransome Such a brother at a million, you wrong The Kings magnificence. Antho. In your opinion, But 'tis most certaine. He does not alone In himselfe refuse to pay it, but forbids All other men. Cam. Are you sure of this? Gasp. You may reade The edict to that purpose, publish'd by him, That will resolve you. Cami. Possible! pray you stand off, If I doe not mutter treason to my selfe My heart will breake; yet I will not curse him, He is my king. The newes you have delivered, Makes me wearie of your company, wee'll salute When we meete next. I'll bring you to the dore, Nay pray you no more complements. Gasp. One thing more And that's substantiall. Let your Adorni. Looke to himselfe. Antho. The king is much incens'd Against him for Fulgentio. Camio. As I am For your slownesse to depart Both. Farewell swoet Lady. Exeunt Gaspa. Antho. Cam. O more then impious times! when not alone Subordinate Ministers of justice are Corrupted, and seduc'd, but kings themselves, (The greater wheeles by which the lesser move) Are broken or disjonted; could it be else A king, to sooth his politique ends, should so far Forsake his honor, as at once to breake Th'Adamant chaines of nature and religion, To binde up Atheisme, as a defence To his darke counsailes? will it ever be That to deserve too much is dangerous, And vertue, when too eminent a crime? Must she serve fortune still? or when stripp'd of Her gay, and glorious favours, loose the beauties Of her owne naturall shape? O my Bertoldo! Thou onely Sun in honors Spheare, how soone Art thou eclipsed and darkened! not the nearnesse Of blood prevailing on the king; nor all The benefits to the generall good dispens'd Gayning a retribution! But that To owe a courtesie to a simple Virgin Would take from the deserving, I finde in me Som sparks of fire, which fann'd with honors breath Might rise into a flame, and in men darken Their usurp'd splendor. Ha! my aime is high, And for the honor of my sex to fall so, Can never prove inglorious. 'Tis resolv'd: Call in Adorni. Clar. I am happy in Such imployment, Madam. Exit Clarin. Cam. Hee's a man, I know that at a reverend distance loves me, And such are ever faithfull: What a Sea Of melting ice I walke on! what strange censures Am I to undergoe! but good intents Deride all future rumors. Ador. I obey Exit Clarin. &amp; Adorn. Your summons, Madam. Cam. Leave the place Clarinda, One woman, in a secret of such waight, Wisemen may thinke too much, nearer Adorni. I warrant it with a smile. Adorn. I cannot aske Safer protection, what's your will? Cami. To doubt Your ready desire to serve me, or prepare you With the repetition of former merits, Would in my diffidence wrong you. But I will And without circumstance, in the trust that I Impose upon you, free you from suspition. Adorn. I foster none of you. Cami. I know you do not. You are Adorni by the love you owe me. Adorn. The surest conjuration. Cami. Take me with you, Love borne of duty, but advance noe further, You are Sir as I sayd to do me service, To undertake a taske, in which your faith, Iudgement, discretion, in a word, your all That's good, must be ingag'd, nor must you studie In the execution, but what may make For the ends I aime at. Adorn. They admit no rivalls. Cam. You answer well, you have heard of Bertoldo's Captivity? and the kings neglect? the greatnesse Of his ransome, fiftie thousand crownes, Adorni, Two parts of my estate. Ador. To what tends this? Cam. Yet I so love the gentleman (for to you I will confesse my weaknesses) that I purpose Now, when he is forsaken by the king, And his owne hopes to ransome him, and receive him Into my bosome as my lawfull husband, Adorni starts and seems troubl'd Why change you colour Ador. 'Tis in wonder of Your vertue, Madam. Cami. You must therefore to Si na for mee, and pay to Gonzaga This ransome for his liberty, you shall Have bills of exchange along with you. Let him sweare A solemne contract to me, for you must be My principall witnesse, if he should. But why Do I entertaine these jealousies? you will do this? Adorn. Faithfully, Madam. But not live long after aside Cam. One thing I had forgot. Besides his freedome He may want accomodations, furnish him According to his birth. And from Camiola Deliver this kisse, printed on your lips kisses him Seal'd on his hand! you shall not see my blushes, I'll instantly dispatch you. Exit Camiola. Adorni. I am halfe Hang'd out of the way already, was there ever Poore lover so imploy'd against himselfe To make way for his rivall? I must doe it, Nay more, I will. If loyalty can finde Recompence beyond hope, or imagination Let it fall on mee in the other world, As a reward, for in this I dare not hope it. Exit The end of the third Act.</field>

But was not Kneeles by him. Borne to such happinesse. No he breaths, come neer, And if't be possible, without his feeling Take off his yrons, so, now leave us privat [His yrons taken off. He does begin to stir, and as transported Exit Iaylor. With a joyfull dreame, how he stares! and feeles his legges, As yet uncertaine, whether it can be True or phantasticall. Ber.

His face Speakes him Adorni! but some glorious Angell Concealing its divinity in his shape, Hath done this miracle, it being not an act For wolvish man. Resolve me, if thou look'st for Bent knees in adoration? Adorn. O forbeare Sir, I am Adorni, and the instrument Of your deliverance; but the benefit You owe another. Ber. If he has a name, Assoone as spoken, 'tis writ on my heart, I am his bond-man. Ador. To the shame of men, This great act is a womans. Ber. The whole sex For her sake must be deifi'd. How I wander In my imagination, yet cannot Ghesse who this PhÅnix should be! Ador. 'Tis Camiola. Ber. Pray you speake't againe, there's musicke in her name Once more I pray you Sir. Ador. Camiola, The Maid of honor. Ber. Curs'd Atheist that I was, Onely to doubt it could be any other, Since she alone in the abstract of her selfe, That small, but ravishing substance comprehends What ever it, or can be wished, in the Iudea of a woman. O what service, Or sacrifice of duty can I pay her! If not to live, and dye her charities slave, Which is resolv'd already. Adorn. She expects not Such a dominion ore you: yet ere I Deliver her demands, give me your hand: On this, as she enjoyn'd me, with my lips I print her love and service by me sent you, Bert. I am orewhelm'd with wonder! Ador. You must now (Which is the sum of all that she desires) By a solemne contract bind your selfe, when she Requires it as a debt, due for your fredome To marrie her. Ber. This does ingage me further, A payment! an increase of obligation! To marry her! 'twas my nil ultra ever! The end of my ambition! O that now The holy man, she present, were prepar'd To joyne our hands, but with that speed, my heart Wishes, mine eyes might see her. Adorn. You must sweare this. Ber. Swear it? Collect all oaths, and imprecations Whose least breach is damnation, and those Ministred to me in a forme more dreadfull, Set heaven, and hell before me, I will take 'em: False to Camiola? Never. Shall I now Begin my vowes to you? Ador. I am no Church-man, Such a one must file it on record, you are free, And that you may appeare like to your selfe (For so she wish'd) her's gold with which you may Redeeme your truncks and servants, and what ever Of late you lost.

So much Sir As I am ever your's for't, now me thinkes I walke in ayre! divine Camiola, But words cannot expresse thee. I'll build to thee An altar in my soule, on which I'll offer A still increasing sacrifice of duty. Exit Ber. Ador. What will become of me now is apparant! Whether a poniard, or a halter be The nearest way to hell (for I must thither, After I have kill'd my selfe) is somewhat doubtfull? This Roman resolution of selfe-murther, Will not hold water, at the high Tribunall, When it comes to be argu'd; my good Genius Prompts me to this consideration. He That kills himselfe, to avoid misery, feares it, And at the best shewes but a bastard valour, This lifes a fort committed to my trust, Which I must not yeeld up, till it be forc'd, Nor will I: Hee's not valiant that dares dy, But he that boldly beares calamitie.

Wise Poets faine that Venus coach is draw'n By doues, and sparrowes, not by beares, and tygres. Ferd. I spare the application.

You shall have just cause To say it hath. The charge of the long siege Defraid, and the losse my subjects have sustain'd Made good, since so farre I must deale with caution, You have your liberty Ferd. I could not hope for gentler conditions. Aurel. My Lord Gonzaga. Since my comming to Siena, I haue heard much Of your prisoner; brave Bertoldo. Gonza. Such an one, Madam, I had. Astut. And have still, Sir, I hope. Gonz. Your hopes deceive you. He is ransom'd, Madame, Astut. By whom, I pray you, Sir. Gonzag. You had best enquire Of your intelligencer. I am no informer. Astut. I like not this. Aurel. He is, as 'tis reported, A goodly gentleman, and of noble parts, A brother of your order. Gonzaga. Hee was, Madam, Till he against his oath wrong'd you, a princesse, Which his religion bound him from. Aurel. Great mindes For tryall of their valours oft maintaine Quarrells that are unjust, yet without malice, And such a faire construction I make of him. I would see that brave enemy; Gonzaga. My duty Commands me to seeke for him. Aur. Pray you doe: And bring him to our presence. Exit Gonzaga. Astut. I must blast His entertainment; may it please your excellency. He is a man debauch'd, and for his riots Cast off by the King my Master, and that, I hope, is A crime sufficient. Ferd.

How soone mine eye had found him! what a port He beares! how well his bravery becomes him! A prisoner! nay, a princly sutor rather! But I am too sudden. Gon. Madame, 'twas his suite, Vnsent for, to present his service to you, Ere his departure. Aurel. With what Majesty He beares himselfe! Astut. The divell I thinke supplies him, Ransom'd, and thus rich too! Aurel. You ill deserve Ferdinand kneeling, kisses her hand. The favour of our hand; we are not well, Give us more ayre. She descends suddenly. Gonz. What sudden qualme is this? Aurel. That lifted yours against mee. Bertol. Thus once more, I sue for pardon Aur. Sure his lips are poyson'd, And through these veines, force passage to my heart Aside. Which is already seaz'd upon. Bertol. I wait, Madam, To know what your commands are; my designes Exact me in another place. Aurel. Before You have our licence to depart; if manners, Civility of manners cannot teach you T'attend our leasure, I must tell you, Sir, That you are still our prisoner, nor had you Commission to free him. Gonz. How's this, Madam? Aurel. You were my substitute, and wanted power Without my warrant to dispose of him. I will pay backe his ransome ten times over, Rather then quit my interest. Bertol. This is Against the law of armes. Aur. But not of love: Aside. Why, hath your entertainment, Sir, beene such In your restraint, that with the wings of feare You would flie from it? Bertol. I know no man, Madame, Enamour'd of his setters, or delighting In cold or hunger, or that would in reason Preferre straw in a dungeon, before A downe bed in a Palace. Aurel. How, come neerer; Was his usage such? Gonz. Yes, and it had beene worse, Had I foreseene this. Aur. O thou mis-shap'd monster! In thee it is confirm'd, that such as have No share in natures bounties, know no pitty To such as have 'em. Looke on him with my eyes, And answer then, whether this were a man, Whose cheekes of lovely fulnesse should be made A prey to meagre famine? or these eyes Whose every glance store Cupids empti'd quiver, To be dimm'd with tedious watching? or these lips, These rudie lips, of whose fresh colour, cherries And roses were but coppies, should grow pale For want of Nectar? or these legges that beare A burthen of more worth, then is supported By Atlas wearied shoulders, should be cramp'd With the weight of yron? O I could dwell ever On this description! Bertoldo. Is this in dirision Or pitty of me? Aurel. In your charity Beleeve me innocent. Now you are my prisoner You shall have fairer quarter, you will shame The place where you have beene, should you now leave it Before you are recover'd. I'll conduct you To more convenient lodgings, and it shall be My care to cherish you. Repine who dare; It is our will. You'll follow mee? Bertoldo. To the centre, Such a Sybilla guiding me.

They come againe, Smiling, as I live: His arme circling her wast: I shall runne mad: Some fury hath possess'd her. If I speake, I may be blasted. Ha, I'll mumble A prayer or two, and crosse my selfe, and then Though the divell fart fire, have at him. Aurel. Let not, Sir, The violence of my passions nourish in you An ill opinion; or grant my carriage Out of the rode, and garbe of private women, 'Tis still done with decorum. As I am A Princesse, what I doe, is aboue censure, And to be imitated. Bertoldo. Gracious Madam, Vouchsafe a little pawse, for I am so rapt Beyond my selfe, that 'till I have collected My scatter'd faculties, I cannot tender My resolution. Aurel. Consider of it, I will not be long from you, Bertoldo walking by musing. Gonzaga. Pray I cannot! This cursed object strangles my devotion! I must speake, or I burst. Pray you faire Lady, If you can in courtesie, direct mee to The chaste Aurelia. Aurel. Are you blinde? who are wee? Gonza. Another kind of thing. Her blood was govern'd By her discretion, and not rul'd her reason: The reverence and Majesty of Iuno Shinde in her lookes, and comming to the campe, Appear'd a second Pallas. I can see No such divinities in you. If I Without offence may speake my thoughts, you are, As it were, a wanton Helen. Aurelia. Good, ere long You shall know mee better. Gonz. Why, if you are Aurelia, How shall I dispose of the Souldier? Astut. May it please you To hasten my dispatch? Aurel. Prefer your suites Vnto Bertoldo, we will give him hearing, And you'll finde him your best advocate. Exit Aurelia Astut. This is rare! Gonz. What are we come to? Roder. Grown up in a moment A favorite! Ferdi. He does take state already. Ber. No, no, it cannot be, yet but Camiola, There is no stop betweene me and a crowne, Then my ingratitude! a sinne in which All sinnes are comprehended! Aide me vertue, Or I am lost. Gonz.

The king your brother will thank you for th'adv?cment Of his affaires Bertol. And yet who can hold out Against such batteries, as her power and greatnesse Raise up against my weake defences! Gonz. Sir, Enter Aurelia. Doe you dreame waking, Slight, shee's here againe. Ber. Walkes she on woollen feete! Aureli. You dwell too long In your deliberation, and come With a criples pace to that which you should fly to Ber. It is confess'd, yet why should I to winne From you, that hazzard all to my poore nothing, By false play send you off a looser from me? I am already too too much ingag'd To the king my brothers anger; and who knowes But that his doubts, and politick feares, should you Make me his equall, may draw war upon Your territories, were that breach made up I should with joy embrace, what now I feare To touch but with due reverence. Aureli. That hinderance Is easily remov'd. I owe the king For a royall visit, which I straight will pay him, And having first reconcil'd you to his favour, A dispensation shall meete with us, Ber. I am wholly yours. Aure. On this booke seale it. Gon. What hand and lip too, then the bargaine's sure, You have no imployment for me? Aurel. Yes Gonzaga, Provide a royall ship. Gonz. A ship? Saint Iohn, Whither are we bound now? Aurel. You shall know hereafter, My lord your pardon, for my too much trenching upon your patience. Ador. Camiola. Whispers to Bertoldo Aurel. How doe you Ber. Indisposed, but I attend you. Exeunt Adorn. The heavie curse that waites on perjurie, And foule ingratitude, pursue thee ever. Yet why from me this? In this breach of faith My loyalty findes reward! what poysons him Proves Mithridate to me! I have perform'd All she commanded punctually, and now In the cleare mirrour of my truth, she may Behold his falsehood. O that I had wings To beare me to Palermo!

You mistake me, I come not (Lady) that you may report, The king to do you honor, made your house (He being there) his court, but to correct Your stubborne disobedience.

I will not wrong my innocence to begge one, What is my crime Sir? Rob. Look on him I favour, By you scorn'd and negelected. Cam. Is that all Sr. Rober. No minion, though that were too much. How can you Answer the setting on your desperate brauo To murther him? Cam. With your leave, I must not kneele Sir. While I replie to this: But thus rise up In my defence, and tell you as a man (since when you are unjust, the diety Which you may challenge as a King, parts from you 'Twas never read in holy writ, or morrall, That subjects on their loyalty were oblig'd To love their Soveraignes vices, your grace, Sir, To such an undeserver is no vertue. Fulgen. What thinke you now Sir? Cam. Say you should love wine, You being the King, and cause I am your subject, Must I be ever drunke? Tyrants, not Kings By violence, from humble vassalls force The liberty of their fooles. I could not love him. And to compell affection, as I take it, Is not found in your prerogative. Rob. Excellent virgin! How I admire her confidence? Cam. He complaines Of wrong done him: but be no more a King, Vnlesse you do me right. Burne your decrees, And of your lawes and statutes make a fire To thaw the frozen numnesse of delinquents, If he escape unpunish'd.

Who hath committed more then sacriledge In the pollution of my cleare fame By his malicious slanders. Rob. Have you done this? Answer truely on your life. Fulgen.

Adde this, if you please, The distance and disparity betweene Their births and fortunes. Cam. What can inocence hope for When such as fit her jugdes, are corrupted! Disparity of birth, or fortune urge you? Or Syren charmes? or at his best in mee, Wants to deserve him? Call some few daies backe, And as he was, consider him, and you Must grant him my inferiour. Imagine You saw him now in fetters with his honour, His liberty lost; with her blacke wings despaire Circling his miseries, and his Gonzaga, Trampling on his afflictions; the great summe Propos'd for his redemption; the King Forbidding payment of it; this neere kinsmen, With his protesting followers, and friends, Falling off from him; by the whole world forsaken; Dead to all hope, and buried in the grave Of his calamities, and then waigh duly What she deserv'd (whose merits now are doubted) That as his better Angell in her bounties Appeard unto him, his great ransome pai'd, His wants, and with a prodigall hand suppli'd, Whether then being my manumised slave, Hee ow'd not himselfe to mee? Aurel. Is this true? Roberto. In his silence 'tis acknoledg'd Gonzag. If you want A witnesse to this purpose, I'll depose it: Cam. If I have dwelt too long on my deservings To this unthankfull man, pray you pardon me, The cause requir'd it. And though now I adde A little in my painting to the life His barbarous ingratitude, to deterre, Others from imitation, let it meet with A faire interpretation. This serpent, Frozen to numnesse, was no sooner warm'd In the bosome of my pitty, and compassion, But in returne, he ruin'de his preserver The prints the yrons had made in his flesh Still ulcerous; but all that I had done (My benefits in sand, or water written) As they had never beene, no more remembred. And on what ground; but his ambitious hopes To gaine this Duchesse favour, Aurelia. Yes, the object, Looke on it better (Lady) may excuse The charge of his affection. Camiol. The object In what? forgiue mee, modesty, if I say You looke upon your forme in the false glasse Of flattery, and selfe-love, and that deceives you, That you were a Duchesse, as I take it, was not Character'd on your face, and that not seene, For other feature, make all these that are Experienc'd in women, judges of 'em, And if they are not Parasites, they must grant For beauty without art, though you storme at it, I may take the righ hand file. Gonzaga. Well said i'faith; I see faire women on no termes will yeeld Priority in beauty. Camiol. Downe proud heart! Why doe I rise up in defence of that, Which, in my cherishing of it hath vndone mee. No Madam, I recant, you are all beauty, Goodnesse, and vertue, and poore I not worthy As a soyle to set you off; enioy your conquest But doe not tyranize. Yet as I am In my lownesse from your height, you may looke on me, And in your suffrage to me, make him know That though to all men else I did appeare The shame and scorne of women, hee stands bound To hold me as her master-piece. Roberto. By my life You have show'n your selfe of such an abject temper, So poore, and low condition'd, as I grieve for Your neerenesse to mee. Ferd. I am chang'd in my Opinion of you Lady, and professe The vertues of your minde, an ample fortune For an absolute Monarch. Gonzaga. Since you are resolv'd To damne your selfe, in your forsaking of Your noble order for a woman, doe it For this. You may search through the world, and meet not With such another PhÅnix. Aurel. On the sudden I feele all fires of love quench'd in the water Of compassion, make your peace; you have My free consent; for here I doe disclaime All interest in you: and to further your Desires, faire Maid, compos'd of worth and honour, The dispensation procur'd by mee, Freeing Bertoldo from his vow, makes way To your embraces. Bertol. Oh, how have I stray'd, And wilfully, out of the noble tract Mark'd mee by vertue! 'Till now, I was never Truely a prisoner; to excuse my late Captivity, I might alleage the malice Of fortune; you that conquer'd me confessing Courage in my defence was no way wanting But now I have surrendred up my strengths Into the power of vice, and on my forehead Branded with mine owne hand in capitall letters Disloyall, and Ingratefull, though barr'd from Humane society, and hiss'd into Some desert nere yet haunted with the curses Of men and women, sitting as a judge Vpon my guilty selfe, I must confesse It justly falls upon me, and one teare Shed in compassion of my suffrings more. Then I can hope for. Cam. This compunction For the wrong that you have done me, though you should Fix here, and your true sorrow move no further, Will in respect I lov'd once, make these eies Two springs of sorrow for you. Ber. In your pittie My cruelty shewes more monstrous, yet I am not, Though most ingratfull, grown to such a height Of impudence, as in my wishes onely To aske your pardon. If as now I fall Prostrate before your feete, you will vouchsafe To act your owne revenge, treading upon me As a viper eating through the bowels of Your benefits, to whom with libertie I owe my being, 'twill take from the burthen That now is insupportable. Cam. Pray you rise, As I wish peace, and quiet to my soule I do forgive you heartily, yet excuse me: Though I deny my selfe a blessing that By the favour of the Dutchesse seconded, With your submission is offer'd to me Let not the reason I alleage for't grieve you, You have been false once. I have done. And if When I am married (as this day I will be) As a perfit signe of your attonement with me You wish me joy, I will receive it for Full satisfaction of all obligations In which you stand bound to me. Ber. I will doe it, And what's more, in despite of sorrow, live To see my selfe vndone, beyond all hope To be made up againe. Syl. My blood begins To come to my heart againe. Cam. Pray you Signior Syl. Call in the holy Frier. Hee's prepar'd For finishing the worke. Syl. I knew I was The man. Heaven make mee thankfull Rob. Who is this? Astu. His Father was the banker of Palermo, And this the heyre of his great wealth, his wisdome Was not hereditarie. Syl. Though you know me not, Your Majesty owes me a round Sum, I have A feele, or two to witnesse, yet if you please To weare my colours, and dance at my wedding. I'll never sue you. Rob. And I'll grant your suite, Syl. Gracious Maddona, Noble, Generall, Brave Captaines and my quondam rivalls wear 'em Since I am confident you dare not harbour A thought, but that way currant. Exit Aurel. For my part I cannot ghesse the issue. Enter Syl. with Syl. Do your duty, And with all speed you can, you may despatch us. Paulo. Thus as a principal ornament to the Church I sease her. All. How. Rob. So young and so religious. Pau. She has forsooke the world. Syl. And Syllie too, I shall run mad. Syl thrust off Rob. Hence with the foole, proceede Sir Pau. Looke on this maid of honor now Truely honor'd in her vow She payes to heaven, vaine delight By day, or pleasure of, the night, She no more thinkes of this faire haire (Favours for great kings to weare) Muw now be shorn. Her rich array Chang'd into a homely gray. The dainties with which she was fed And her proud flesh pampered, Must not be tasted, from the spring, For wine cold water we will bring And with fasting mortifie The feasts of sensuality. Her jewells, beads, and she must looke Not in a glasse, but holy booke; To teach her the nere erring way To immortality. O may She as she purposes to be A Child new borne to piety, Persever in in it, and good men With Saints and Angels say Amen Cam. This is the marriage! this the port! to which My vowes must steere me, fill my spreading sayles With the pure wind of your devotions for me, That I may touch the secure haven, where Eternall happinesse keepes her residence, Temptations to frailty never entring. I am dead to the world, and thus dispose Of what I leave behind me, and dividing My state into three parts, I thus bequeath it. The first to the faire Nunnery, to which I dedicate the last, and better part Of my fraile life; a second portion To pious uses; and the third to thee Adorni, for thy true and faithfull service. And ere I mytake lust farwel with hope To finde a gran, may suite to you is that You would for my sake pardon this young man And to his merits love him, and no further. Rob. I thus confirme it. Gives his hand to Fulgen. to Bertoldo Cami. And as ere you hope Like me to be made happy, I conjure you To reassume your order; and in fighting Bravely against the enemies of our faith Redeeme your morgag'd honor. Rob. I restore this The white crosse. Once more brothers in armes, Ber. I'll live and die so. Cam. To you my pious wishes. And to end All differences, great Sir I beseech you To be an arbitrator, and compound The quarrell, long continuing betweene The Duke and Dutchesse. Rober. I'll take it into My special care. Cam. I am then at rest, now father Exeunt Paulo. &amp; Camiola. Conduct me where you please. Rob. She well deserves Her name, the Maid of Honor! May she stand To all posterity, a faire example, For noble Maides to imitate. Since to live In wealth and pleasure is common; but to part with Such poyson'd baites is rare, there being nothing Vpon this Stoge of life to be commended, Though well begun, till it be fully ended. Exeunt. The END.</field>
