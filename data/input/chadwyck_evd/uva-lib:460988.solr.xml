      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. —A Chamber in Zenora's House. Basso. There is nothing so cruel as love. My master said to me a day ago, ‘Basso, thou growest thin; what ails thee, man?’ I answered, ‘If I knew my ailment I should be far toward a cure.’ Said he, ‘Then I will inform you. I have observed of late that you have forgot to warm my shoes and to cleanse my hose of dust. You have omitted to put a keen edge on my razor, till it was as blunt as a sick man's appetite’—(Ah, said I, there lies my complaint)— ‘and once you would have brushed out my hair with a horse's currycomb had I not perceived it in time, and saved my pate and thine own. Now all this argues a distracted mind and a distempered condition, whence resulteth languor and emaciation!— those were his very words—languor and emaciation— ‘therefore thou art in love.’ Ah, my master is a rare scholar. But she approaches. Surely she will compassionate my emaciation. Enter Nita. Nita. How now, Basso! Where is thy master, that thou hast leisure to do nothing? Basso. My master, seeing my emaciation, is moved with more pity than some, and leaves me to myself and my melancholy. Nita. If thou wouldst eat less and walk more, thou wouldst have less emaciation. Basso. Ignorant girl! what dost thou conceive to be the signification of the term emaciation? Nita. A burden which thou carriest without profit, and much against thy will. Basso. Not so far out. Thou conceivest it to imply that of which in truth it signifies the result. Love is indeed a burden, but emaciation signifieth not love. Nita. Nay, but fat. Basso. What? Nita. Fat, flesh, stupidity, that come of sloth and high feeding. Basso. Does she mock me? Then I will waste away yet farther. Nita. Thou canst afford to waste, having, like a rich spendthrift, much to lose. Basso. I will lose half my flesh. Nita. Do, and thou wilt yet be twice as big as another man. Basso. I will pine to death, and then they will bury me. Nita. When they have found a churchyard big enough. Woe is me! the people passing will take the grave for the foundation of a house, and the contract of wood for thy coffin will enrich two timber merchants. Basso. How hast heart to jest about it? If thou shouldst die, I would plant a rose-tree over thee, and bedew thy tomb daily with my tears. Nita. A good thought—give me the freehold of thy grave. Basso. Wherefore? Nita. Then, when thou diest, I will plant an orchard and an olive grove upon thee, and build a farm and grow rich. But for tears, I have not enough to bedew so many acres. Basso. Cruel, cruel! Enter Livia. Livia. How dare you, slut, revile my Basso? Basso. Thy Basso, forsooth! I am Nita's. Nita. Then I will give so great a piece of good to Livia for a small matter. Livia. Abuse him not. He is worth many of thee. Nita. Ay, if we were sold by the pound. Farewell, Basso. [Exit Nita. Livia. Shame on her, impudent wench! Basso. Speak but one other word against her— Livia. I will. She knows not when she is flattered. Are there two such men in the world that she should chance on such another offer? Basso. Thou art a sensible girl. Livia. Trust me to know a fine manly fellow when I see him—none of your elegant fine-waisted gentlemen, but a good solid piece of work. Basso. I think I am all sound and solid. Livia. Indeed thou art; and then such a sweet smile! Such noble pity when the half-finished skeletons, thy brother-men, look enviously upon thee. Basso. True, true; thou speakest well: but Nita is better favoured. Livia. Cruel, cruel! Basso. I have no patience with women. I will go look for my master. [Exit Basso. Enter Zenora. Zenora. What, crying, girl? Come, dry those scalded eyes, And send Teresa hither. [Exit Livia. Oh, these girls! When does a girl begin to think of lovers? Here is a question for physicians, who Dispute the time when infants quicken first, But never yet have dressed my doubt in Latin. I never knew one that had not yet reached The stage to think of lovers. Ere she talks, A child will choose some boy of two years old Out of a family. Around his neck She wreathes her arms and kisses him: the rest, His brothers and his sisters, bites and kicks,— The sisters chiefly. Soon as they can see To know one from another, this they do And show their love by little brutish cries. But what they think before they clearly see, I have had many and I cannot tell. If I may guess, they're thinking of no good. One only girl I know with wit enough To hide her folly (though, be sure, 'tis there), And here she comes. Enter Teresa. Teresa. You sent for me—but pardon; I had forgot my duty and respect, And have no child's right to break ceremonies. Zenora. You silly chick! so that you find a place Under the old hen's wing, how differs it Whether you be or be not of her brood? Teresa. You honour me too far: but now, being come, How many I serve you, that you sent for me? Zenora. I wished to speak with you. Teresa. Ah me! I fear You have observed some fault in me. 'Tis true That I have many—more than other maids. I leave my broideries about the rooms, Each day forget a thousand little things, And weightier duties twice or thrice at least. I let the moths eat through my newest robe, Leaving it by i' the press unpeppered, break Thrice more than all my savings can repay, And let the rents run in my gowns unstitched. Then, too, I am impatient o'er my tasks, And leave religious books, soon as your eyes Are turned some other way, for pages strewn With follies of romance. Zenora. 'Tis not of these, The rifer faults in girls of your crude age That I would speak with you. Teresa. Have I then more? Alas! I thought these same were full enough, Nay, far too many, and repent them sore. But now I have some new fault yet unlearned. Tell me, dear mistress, that I may make haste In season to reform it. Zenora. Duteous girl! Know then this fault is much the contrary Of that which most befalls young maidens set In your condition, and, though 'tis a sin Against all nature, yet may it be called A virtuous failing. Teresa. 'Tis some strange default That so makes one the unmingling elements Of extreme vice and venial offence. Zenora. Well, know that when, some few days past, my son Came back from Paris home, his studies o'er, I said within myself, Ah, foolish dame, To graft into thine house a portionless And orphan child of such a comely face, A barren plash with such a flush of flowers Of other sort than goes with gilded fruit. (Nay, blush not): surely, looking on thy son, So manful-fair, so fraught with golden bales Of wisdom, sailing to so rich a port Upon the impulse of all favouring winds, So wide an harbour of fair heritage, She will work mischief to her best of power, And shake down all her petals at his feet. So deeming, I bethought to closely watch Thy ways, and guard against what well thou know'st Would be disaster to our noble house, When lo! the wind blows from the other pole An ice-flaw cutting to the bone with frost, And my fear's very opposite befalls In such excess as to become a vice. I would not have thee so forget thy station To pay lewd and o'erreaching courtesies Unto my son; nor can I well abide To mark thee, with an equal arrogance, So scorn and hold him cheap as now thou dost. I see the young man is much grieved thereat, And he so manful, virtuous, and wise, A princess might take pride to speak with him. Teresa. I will reform this to my best of power. Zenora. So! you deny it not! Why, I had thought Some light, unwarranted, foolish vanity Had made it seem the young man fancied you, And, being modest and of humble mind, As I have found you hitherto, and chaste, That you of purpose slighted him, for fear You else might seem approve his too mean choice, And so of fostering it, considering well The breach of custom set betwixt your fates, Albeit approving—as how should I doubt?— His form to match his mind, and loving him, But deeming all too high to honour one So stinted as yourself in fortune's gifts. If so it proved, I meant to comfort you By showing (mixed with wholesome bitters culled Of choice advice and sweets of hinted promise How some day I should find you your fit match) Of my son's mind, how it was built too firm On pride and reason's solid marble-blocks, No shifting sands of changeful phantasies, To fall at storm of aught so silly a maid, And bury in its ruin all our race, Nay, of no lady so beneath his rank. But now it seems your pert young vanity Has pitched a higher and a higher flight, And that you scorn where prayer would be profane, And dare hate where you should not dare to love. Teresa. Dear lady, for the gratitude I owe, I cannot blame thee for so bitter taunts, Who know myself beneath thyself and son In all that makes man envied of his kind. I have nor rank, nor riches, nor high birth, And owe thee all; though, to be frank, I deem A mindful benefactor scarce less vile Than a forgetful heir of benefits, And to do good offencefully more cruel Than generous evil; for that the other binds Your enemy's hands to peace with chains of honour, Which if he break, he wounds himself and thee, But more himself, since fame is more than life. Zenora. Ungracious girl! do you requite me thus? However this your o'erstrained frowardness T'ward me shall not yield less my charity. How came you, though, to bend your scorn so high, To shoot its venom upward at my son? Teresa. I know not if I flouted him. Perchance My heart shone through in action all too clear. Zenora. Your heart! a proper seat to harbour scorn, Of him too! In the ocean where all praises Empty themselves what bitter brook falls here? 'Mid such a scene what blemish can yours find Where other's eyes can see but virtues sown In that fair rose-garden, his opening life, Like flowers, so thick that not a weed can sprout, Or it is quickly smothered by the throng? Teresa. I know not, madam. Far as my sight carries He seems all honour, wisdom, courage, truth. Zenora. What here for scorn? Teresa. Indeed, I scorn him not. Zenora. That's well, at least. Then wherefore hate you him? Teresa. I know not. Zenora. But you do. Teresa. It is not hate. He never wronged me. Zenora. Must that be for hate? Hate may be where no cause, then bitterest. It is a plant that grows without a seed, Or, if there be a seed, oft in the breast, Of him who harbours hate, a curse self-fed Upon his heart, a fire upon his house. Men hate most whom they have injured. Injury Begets the scorn of self, which scorn begets The hate of him who made us scorn ourself By hurting him (we say he made us do it, So just!) If this of yours, then, be not hate, Which shows so like hate, what then is it, child? Teresa. I cannot tell that neither. I am but A foolish girl, and make all estimates More by main instinct than by reason, and At the first glance. Why, I have known myself Hate one who had red hair, only for that, No other cause. Zenora. Well, wear more courtesy, And, with what flimsy gauze you can, inveil Your misformed feelings, if to mould them straight, To need no veil needs more wit than you own, And be this warning of its kind the last. But what's the proverb of an angel's wings? I have a glimpse. Enter Raolfo. Raolfo. What, mother, not alone? But in sweet converse with our lovesome guest. Why, this is well! You live too much apart; And women have a thousand whims to tell To other women, which in solitude Must well nigh burst their heart with holding them. Leastwise when you are met your tongues run on Like prattling brooks or birds, or children's talk. Nay, mother, frown not so; you know they do. Is it not fact, fair lady? Teresa. So you say, And it becomes us not to praise ourselves. Raolfo. Why, 'tis no self-praise to disown this charge. 'Tis but a slight fault of great virtue born; A wild-rose sucker from the double rose; Waste that makes riot with luxuriant growth, To breed fair vices of excess of virtue, That make the pruner's hand shrink from his task, Spare half, and every stroke a sweet regret; A wild spray from the root of social joy, The pleasure in his fellow's company Which causes man alone of all the beasts To live in cities and to bow to laws, For “man by nature is political,” As Aristotle saith, and woman more. Teresa. You talk above me. Raolfo. Lady, say not so. My talk is apt to relish of the schools, For where the treasure is, you know, 'tis said The heart is also. But pray pardon me. Teresa. It needs no pardon. Raolfo. Mother, plead for me. Zenora. Nay, I will leave thee make thine own excuse. It is the one sole flaw I find in thee, And will depart when thou art more acquainted With foolish company and empty talk, Which schooling cannot lack, if thou live here, And troubles me to think of, lest how much With this blameworthy go worth praise to ruin: For ah! we lose our virtues with our faults, Like plants with the close-kissing parasite, Too fast embracing to unwreathe their arms And let us slay the weed and leave the flower, So subtly are they woven each with each: And when the last fault left in generous youth, As pride of heart or mind, is rooted out, 'Tis weighty odds some ranker vice grows up. Farewell, and seek me in the oratory. [Exit Zenora. Raolfo. A mother sees her son through mists of tears, With eyes love-blinded. Pardon her and me. My banter and my craving grace for it, That neither meant thee pain, gave pain alike. Teresa. It wounded not, kind sir. Raolfo. Ah, say not so: For when such words wound not they oft breed scorn, And I had rather wound than be despised. Teresa. I should condemn myself in scorning you. Raolfo. Not so, but rather me. Teresa. What fruit could grow Of the rash judgment of an untaught girl? Raolfo. Such know a many things veiled from our souls. Know you the words so often read at mass These words of Matthew are not to be found in the order of the mass. Of wisdom that escapes the wise and learned? Teresa. And is revealed to sucklings and to babes. Raolfo. Indeed, I meant not that. Teresa. But it is true, For I am young and foolish. Raolfo. Once again, My meaning was your soul soared nigher heaven. Teresa. For being foolish? Raolfo. Nay, for being pure, Purer than purest men, who at the best Must soil their hands in battle, which your fate Spares you; and though they beat down sin and self, And come out like the pure gold tried with fire, Yet must they hear and see the sin of the world, Which you need not; and therefore does their soul Make harmony in dissonance, while yours With one consent sings with the circling stars, An hymn more acceptable, though less praised By the great maker. Teresa. Once again you speak Above me, sir. Raolfo. Alas! how should we take Thoughts that lie out of our experience? How should she catch by the thin gossamer wing, The filmy fleeting wing, and hold light hints, A moment in our reach, then gone, of things She knows not, and is blest in knowing not, For as I think my mother keeps her close— Once more I beg forgiveness. Teresa. And for what? Raolfo. For troubling thee. Teresa. Seek out some worthier ear, And waste no wisdom on so shaly soil. Raolfo. Why shame me so with what I most would be? I am not wise, unless love makes us wise, As some say. Teresa. How, sir! Raolfo. Look not on me so. Indeed I love thee, loved thee heart and soul Since first our eyes kist. Wherefore leave me thus? Teresa. It ill becomes me, sir, being that I am, To list love tales from so unequal tongue. Raolfo. What! am I scorned, then? Teresa. I denied it once, But now I am not sure. You see my state, A poor man's orphan in your mother's home. You cannot mean the love of married names, And so to stain my cheek with flatteries Redder than shame, and blow on the frail flower Of my good name, your mother's alms-woman, Under the guise of high philosophy, Feeling your way with hints of nameless things, Is treacherous and cruel, yea, and base. Raolfo. By Heaven, I never meant but lawful love! And when I wooed thee 'twas to marry thee. Teresa. Have I not heard that vows like these are rife, And read how men with hooks catch innocence By such fair baits? No truth bears leaning on. Indeed I now begin to scorn you, sir. Raolfo. 'Tis I am wronged. What root lurked in my words For such suspicion? And where found you cause Believe my virtue lighter than your own? 'Tis ill to put such books in young maids' hands Which make them deem the jewel chastity Hath no place in the virtues of a man. Hence comes it that so many cast their love For swine to trample. Teresa. Trust me, when I love I will choose well. Meanwhile impute to pride My quick suspicion, not to sin in me; And leave me now, and speak no more of this. Raolfo. No more. Your words have wounded me too deep. [Exit Raolfo. Teresa. I fear I missed his meaning wide: nor know Cause why to loathe him so, as yet I do, Who is good and true—nay, on truth's further side. But from the eye's turn when I saw him first Aversion whelmed me, deepening into hate. Quicker than stream e'er deepened t'ward the sea, If one whom conscience quits of sin can hate Another full as pure and higher poised Upon the nobler virtues of a man. 'Tis strange, this loathing: but we do not love, I at least do not, by main weight of merit. Perchance 'tis well, for else the sin-stained soul, Baffled alike of virtue and of love, Might find life's desert all too desolate. Give me a man less perfect. Enter Fausta. Fausta. How now, child? I met but now my cousin in a fret. He scowled upon me darkly, and I knew 'Twas some fresh slight of yours. Why, are you blind? Can you not see he is not one to scorn? Or blinder still, and cannot see his love? Teresa. He told me of it but a moment past. Fausta. And you would none of it? Teresa. What else should I do? Fausta. Why should he throw his jewel at your feet? For what so honour you o'er all our sex? And to be scorned at last! Teresa. Why blame you me? I did not make him love, or, if not so, Can you, of all that breathe, find cause of blame In my refusal? Fausta. Nay, I will be frank, As I am ever. I do love the man, And hate thee for so turning of his love. I read his soul; I see his high-pitched aims, Matched with his strength to give them living shape: My life beats with his life; I first of men Knew and believed in him: I ever burned To be his wife, to help him bring to birth All noble acts and fill his destiny. I am half mad to see him bent on one Who cannot so do for him as I would, Or value him e'en at man's market price, Far less as I do: and though, as thou say'st, Small cause have I to hate thee for that act Which leaves the race to me, yet is it cold To creep in second into his high heart, Thou having left it to the rats; o'er all It goads me but to think a witling girl Should flout my hero. Teresa. Evil was the fate That brought me here a discord in your house! Forgive me. Fausta. Nay, speak not, speak not of that, Or thou wilt soften all my rage. I know Thy lot is hard; mine aunt is coarsely kind: But know at least in me an enemy Open and honest as the burning fire Or foaming sea. We stand on equal ground; Thy manners speak thy birth no worse than mine; And I believe them, and for that the more Have cause to hate thee as a rival, not To overlook thee as a toy of his. Teresa. I thank thee, and I thank thee not—the first For thy respect, the second for thy hate, Which I have scarce deserved, for, trust my truth, I ever looked on thee with tenderest love. So thou art crueller than is thine aunt, For my love pours a poison in each stab Which thy tongue deals me. Farewell. Let me go. [Exit Teresa. Fausta. Go, and for thine own like thy friendship keep, For friendship was not made for souls diverse As thine and mine, but somewhat same demands To o'erbridge those inconstant properties, Which change from man to man, with kindred link. I will bestow mine better than on thee. Enter Raolfo. Raolfo. What! quarrelling with our sweet guest? Fausta. What cause Have you, sir, pray, to deem our guest so sweet? Raolfo. Is she not pure and— Fausta. Yes as many more, Women of all degrees of idiocy. When cynics charge the frailty of our sex, I marvel much they choose inconstancy To aim their shafts at and impurity. Are not pure women plenty as white flowers, Sweet fruit, or any other natural thing? It is a virtue built on weakness, and Most lack bare courage to be otherwise, Or, having this, lack wit to think of it; Or, having that, yet lack enough to find The means of pleasure. So much for that praise. And for inconstancy, when have you known A fool to change his mind? for stubbornness And folly keep each other well in touch, More kin than blind whelps littered at a birth. Women are mostly cowards, therefore pure, And fools, and therefore constant; virtues these Common enough: but seek the higher sort, Justice and prudence and true fortitude— How many women will you find have these? Raolfo. It may be, few enough, and properly. These are the things commended in a man. Women have other virtues, other faults. We praise the hound for fleetness, and the ox For strength, and all things for their proper grace; And finding that, we should go thank high Heaven. None ever blamed an ox for lack of scent, Or hound for that he could not draw a plough. Fausta. But higher creatures higher virtues owe, Therefore are fortitude and prudence more Than purity by all the difference 'Twixt man and woman: and if, as may hap, One of the baser ore should chance possess The virtues of the nobler, which more just, To honour her as miracle, or loathe As a deformity? Raolfo. Show first to me This woman, and then will I answer you. Fausta. Perchance I could. But were not such more meet Than the other sort to be a hero's bride? Raolfo. Nay, but to be the wife of some weak will. Fausta. How so? Raolfo. The wise man needs no counsellor, The strong no strong will to bear up his own. Fausta. You deem, then, that true friendship should patch up Gaps and deficiencies on either side; The strong will lending strength unto the weak, The weak returning grace unto the strong. Raolfo. You reason close and readily conceive, So is it written by the sage. Fausta. Come now, I will refute your sage. Raolfo. Ye gracious Heavens! Fausta. Come now, sir, tell me have you once yet found A man o'ertopping others in all arts So that the supreme soldier should likewise Be mightiest painter, sculptor, poet, sage, Or otherwise? Raolfo. Indeed far otherwise. Fausta. The fount whereof, as some would deem it, springs Solely from brief duration of our days. Think you so? Raolfo. Thus the sages bid me think. Fausta. You mean, with ampler scope of years the sage Should prove best hero, poet, painter, all; Or, in the strait and closure of our lives, Had virtue beckoned from another mount, The sculptor had quelled armies, and in turn The hero tamed the stubborn marble's will Till icy chaos yearned to cosmic life. Raolfo. I do. Fausta. So do not I, for I have seen In virgin soil of children's untilled minds A thousand differences. But deem that waived. Have you yet found, for you have many friends, One mind that stood right well in divers arts, Though he o'ertopped not others in them all? Raolfo. I have. Fausta. Now answer me this one time more. Hath he o'ertopped all others e'en in one? Raolfo. Nay; but to what end all this argument, My lady Plato? Fausta. Just to this, my friend. If for scant power or time we may not pass All ways our fellows, were it not far best Climb to the summit of one art? That so, 'Twere wise to seek a friend less powerful To fill demerits up, than with more stress To cumulate our merits? Raolfo. I must crown Thy brows with laurel; but for answer this. I know not if the man who perfects one, Or he who tills all gardens of his soul, Be higher in God's sight; though thine in man's Be first, and in this life, in God's my hero, Climbing from life to life through deathless days, Might win at last to complete excellence. Fausta. Hast no ambition? Raolfo. 'Tis a fault. Fausta. Yet still Thou would'st win triumph here, and leave beyond, With all its doubts, to others. Raolfo. It is true, Such is my strongest craving. Fausta. Choose a friend To help thee gain it. Raolfo. What! abandon me To one whose vice by mutual sympathy Should grow into and double mine, and lose In feverish thirst of fame that soft “well done” In him who seeks but God's approof? Fausta. Go to. I am made foolish in thee. Go, turn priest Or true philosopher. Renounce the world, And when thou hast renounced it boast thereof. None will believe thee. All will say, “This man Glosses bare weakness with self-sacrifice.” Raolfo. I say I care not for esteem of men, Save where it tallies with approof of God; Nor with less scorn put by their blame, save where God's censure and my soul's in chorus sing With it, to damn some vice all know for such. Farewell, my cousin. I will seek my book. [Exit Raolfo. Fausta. Now am I madder than I was before. O noblest soul that ever woman loved! It were more privilege to share with such That wise retirement, than with vainer hearts The esteem of princes and the crowd's applause. But with increased love comes increased despair, For now I see him past my furthest reach. But is Teresa worthier than I? Faugh, patience! We shall see that by-and-by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene.—The same. A Room in Zenora's House. Basso. As if there were not work enough already for a man in my condition, here must needs come a stranger with his lean, lazy vagabond of a servant, who doubtless will leave his master's work to sweeten my own. It is a blessing if I have not to wait on the knave himself too. Enter Guido. Guido. Kind sir. Basso. Kind sir. Guido. Honoured sir. Basso. Honoured sir—(aside) why, is this a barber or a dancing master?—your highness. Guido. I perceive you are an accomplished gentleman. May I presume you are the gentleman in waiting upon the gentleman, your master, Signor Raolfo? Basso. The same, at your service. What a fool is this! Guido. Pray, sir, have you ever been at the French court? Basso. Why? Guido. I perceive you have, so to speak, the same polish of manner as I myself learnt there. It is, indeed, the only school of true chivalry and knighthood. Basso. Why, is it the custom there for every knave of a serving-man to address his fellow as sir,—kind sir,—honoured sir,—are you the gentleman in waiting upon the gentleman your master? Guido. Why, where else could you have learned this courtesy? Basso. Of you. Guido. Of me? Come now, you have not known me long enough and closely enough to mould your graciousness on my model. Basso. Have you learnt so little at the French court that you know not when one is making a jape of you? Guido. Nay, sir, but I can afford to pass over such things. My courage is undoubted, and I would think shame to soil my ruffles chastising an unmannerly menial. Basso. Oh! [Exit Basso. Guido. The plebeian porpoise! The untamed elephant! Enter Raolfo and Ilario. Ilario. What do you here, sir? Go, prepare my chamber. Guido. Sir, on the moment. [Exit Guido. Ilario. Now, my gentle host, For you are son of my kind hostess, and My mother's friend, we should be better known, Since you denied me privilege at Paris, And never sought me out at the King's court. Raolfo. My hours were little mine. Ilario. Ah yes, you studied. 'Twas a strange freak in one so shaped by nature For better things.—Your pardon, though. Raolfo. Of course. I understand. Ilario. The chase, the tilt, the dance, Tennis, and fencing should have been your books. You know what frolic parties were made up. You must have seen us go forth many times Into the country with our steeds and dogs. Why, had you come, I should have made you known To all the other pages, and the dames Who made our life so merry. Raolfo. Like to like. I should not much have loved them, nor they me. Ilario. Why, you are prone to sadness. Give it up; It is a bad companion; and make use Of all life's seasons in their fitting way. I mean to take to grief, and books, and gout When I am fifty, if I live so long, Which is not like to happen, if I spare My health no more than some time past I have. Raolfo. And herein would you have me copy you, Or live my time out? Ilario. Why, to wear a skin Like an eared field with furrows, or a tunic Ill cut that hangs in bags, or a dried snake? To totter and to shamble to and fro, And drivel folly with a slobbering tongue, While all diseases harbour in your flesh? Raolfo. This is the life you run some risk to bear, If death upon the threshold of old age Should play the jilt and leave you in the lurch. But I look forward to another sort Free of disease and ripe in wisdom's fruit. Ilario. Give me the flowers of May. Raolfo. Well, as you will. Tastes vary. Ilario (aside). Now, was ever such a youth? He might change places with his grandmother, And she grow older and he more a man! Well, sir, I am no match for you, I see, In strifes of bickering wit; but let us meet At some fit time with two good bowls between, And frothing burgundy for argument, Who swallows more to be the better man, And I will match you. Raolfo. Ay, no doubt, no doubt. Ilario. Or I will fly a hawk, or back a steed, Or make a song and set it to a tune, Upon the cithern or the mandolin, Or run a tilt, or hit a mark— Raolfo. Or boast. In all these things I yield pre-eminence. Ilario. Sir—but no matter. Let us e'en be friends. For I would love you well if you would let me. Raolfo. None hinders. Love and friendship must go free. Ilario. But who comes here? You never told me, friend, What angels make your house a paradise. Your sister, pray? Raolfo. No, but my mother's friend, One of our family. Ilario. So ho! Raolfo. Excuse me. I will go tell my mother you are come. [Exit Raolfo. Enter Teresa. Teresa. Your pardon, sir, I had not seen you. Ilario. Nay, Go not, fair lady; hold me, as I am, But nothing, and o'erlook my presence; or, Since I must be a guest here for some space, And you must bear with me till by main wont You learn my sufferance, pray begin at once. Raolfo is but gone to seek his mother; She will be here anon. Teresa. I thank you, sir; I came but for these broideries, and now Must go, for which I beg you pardon me. (Aside) Pray Heaven he may not let me! Ilario. Broideries! I have some skill in these things. May I see? A good device, and admirably wrought! By you of course? Teresa. Ay, sir, the work is mine. Ilario. I have some such the labour of a countess. You shall have all to copy if you will. Teresa. How can I thank you fully? Ilario. Nay, for that, They shall be honoured by your touch for me, And henceforth so possess a double worth. Teresa. Half for the giver, half— Ilario. For thee? Not so: I said not so; but half for thy sake, half For a friend's sake, the giver's only son. Nay, I will alter that, and hold them dear An hundred times for thee, and once for him. Teresa. You flatter me too much. Ilario. Where anything Cannot be done, it cannot be too much. Teresa. Why, worse and worse. Ilario. You mean, my gracious one, That I draw near and nearer to the truth. Teresa. Nay, further from the truth, in drawing near To merit I possess not. Ilario. Why, then, truth And goodness are not one. Teresa. I miss your drift, But only see you mean more flattery; But they stay long. Permit me lead you, sir, Into your hostess' presence. Ilario. Joyfully. And blessèd is the way when angels lead. Teresa. Oh, fie! [Exeunt Ilario and Teresa. Enter Nita on one side, Guido on the other. He pursues her. Guido. Sweet lady, shun me not, I pray. Nita. Why, he is almost as fine a young gentleman as his master, let alone as ours, who is more beautiful in his person than engaging in his speech. Guido. Sweet lady. Nita. Well, sir? Guido. Be not so coy. Fold not thyself up in bashfulness as the flower at night-fall, or as the oyster closeth up his shells at shadow of the pearl-diver! Nita. How beautiful! Guido. Yes, my words are beautiful. I and my master are both poets. Nita. Not your words, but your hair. Who curled it? Guido. Why, it was last curled by a countess. What think you of that? (Aside) I shall soon be as good a liar as my master. I heard him—the rogue. Nita. Give me that beautiful handkerchief. Guido. It is hard to part with it, for a duchess bestowed it upon me. There is another for you. But let me first weep a few tears on it, and I will then present it to you. Nita. Do not blubber on it, if it is to be mine. Guido. Pretty untrained rose, thou shouldst have said, “I will kiss thy tears from it, and restore it to thee.” And then I would have said, “It shall now be ever doubly dear to me.” And thou shouldst have made reply, “What! half for me, and half for the giver?” But now you have spoilt it all. Nita. How well you follow your master! Guido. What! were you listening too? Nita. For what do you take me? Behind this door. Guido. And I behind that. Was it not an enchanting pastoral? On this side gallantry, on that simplicity; court ease, and home-bred bashfulness; elegance and native decorousness;—he learnt it all from me. I taught him upon what principle to make love. Hence the resemblance. He is a good pupil, a fair pupil. Nita. What! Have you but one way? Guido. Why yes, usually. When versatility is needless, why put yourself about to invent new stratagems? Nita. Then Basso could instruct thee. Guido. What! the fat serving-man? Nita. The same. He makes love every time a new way, and each time worse than the last. Guido. Makes love! To whom? Nita. To me. Guido. To you! I will challenge him, and spit him like a fat ox. Nita. You may spare yourself the pains. I like you better. Guido (aside). How rapid my conquests are, to be sure!—Come, a kiss. Nita. Here is my mistress. Let us away. [Exeunt Guido and Nita. Enter Zenora, Ilario, and Fausta. Zenora. Now I will leave you until dinner-time: And you, dear niece, shall entertain our guest, Since poor Teresa, who should help you here, Is taken with some sudden bashful fit (She calls it illness) and withdrawn from sight Into her chamber, and my strange dear boy Pleads he hath business of such pressing call It may not be waved off or put aside. Farewell. [Exit Zenora. Ilario. Sweet lady, if I trouble thee, I prithee tell me. Fausta. Sir, I shall as well As courtesy permits. Ilario. Your cousin, lady, Is very strange and distant. Fausta. It were strange If he should seem not strange to you. Ilario. Indeed, Court life so customs all the palate's touch To nicety, that this you say is fact; Yet I could e'en put by fastidiousness, Nor quarrel with strong wine if it be sharp, In this case; and it numbs me thus the more That the deep friendship I had felt for him At first sight, should meet such November welcome. Fausta. I said 'twere strange if he should not seem strange To you, but it is stranger you can love him. Ilario. It may seem so; but 'neath the rugged rind Of rude harsh bearing and unsoftened manner I seem to see that lurking, so to speak, Which bids us look for mellower fruit anon. Fausta. Indeed. Ilario. Indeed I do. Believe me, lady, I am sincere. A week at court or so Would mend him and would make him. Fausta. Such as you? I think not. Ilario. Nay, perhaps not: but you flatter. Fausta. 'Tis the first time. Ilario. That makes the flattery Too flattering. Fausta. Pray ease your mind on that. Ilario. I will, and when I go again to Paris, Will tell the duchess how a lady here Could give a compliment as graceful turn As any at the court. Fausta. And add to it That the receiver had a shrewder scent To catch the perfume of the folded words, And so extract the quintessence of praise Thrice cohobated and reclarified, As bees find honey hidden in the flower, Than any courtier: though they lack not wit If e'en their wittiest have this superflux. Ilario. You are my match, in truth you are my match, And bandy courtesies with equal fence. Fausta. Nay, I disclaim the equality. Ilario. Not so. Pray, draw the game, believing me sincere When I confess my loss as great as thine. Tiros, sweet lady, have beat veterans In their first battle. Fausta. Nay, I yield the ground, And draw my rude recruits out of the field. The prize I cannot win, which, if I might, Would suit me ill. Ilario. And what is this fair prize? But here, see back your cousin in good time. Enter Raolfo. Raolfo. My mother sent me here to walk with you And show the beauties of our native town (If you approve) till dinner. Ilario. Willingly: But, sir, this lady and myself have been Contesting hotly with our keenest wit, And leave the event disputed: but the prize She, as the strong should still be merciful, Hath yielded me. Farewell awhile, sweet foe, I'll wear the wreath. [Exit Ilario with Raolfo. Fausta. Of folly; 'twill become thee. Had ever vanity till now such power As so transform a man not quite a fool, But with a kind of vulgar craft and cunning, Into a downright credulous idiot, To take all satire down in compliment With greedy gulp, as a fish sucks the hook in. Enter Teresa. Why, how now, girl? your sudden fit of vapours Has robbed you of a treat. Teresa. What treat? Fausta. The sight Of the most complete puppy littered yet. Teresa. Whom point you at? Fausta. Whom but our new-come guest. Teresa. Indeed, I think you wrong him much. Fausta. So, then, You know him. Teresa. I have seen him. Fausta. Since he came? Teresa. A short while since. Fausta. Why, then, you must be deaf Or blind. Teresa. Why? Fausta. Had you known him years agone And deemed him not a fool, then had I deemed That either he had changed or you forgot. But now— Teresa. Well now? Fausta. I know not what to think. Teresa. Think yourself right, and me, as ever, wrong. Fausta. Here's sudden mischief. Now, if he could know You fought his battles thus, I dare be sworn He would enlarge his conquests with your name, The fellow is so vain. Teresa. Well, say your will. Fausta. So now the tempest rises, it grows hot, The air is sulphurous, and the clouds blush red. Teresa. Now, truly, you presume too far. Fausta. Presume! 'Tis a new word. I like it on your lips. You never were but tame until this hour. Let me commend the change, and thank the cause When he returns. Teresa. I say you go too far. I will not sit with you. Fausta. Nay, as you will. Yet stay a moment. I have words for you. Have you that hardihood, that effrontery To flout Raolfo under all our eyes, And turn on us who give but things their names In matter of this youth? Will you, on whom His love stooped downward, having brushed it off, Grope in the gutter for this mite of manhood, This filthy brass thing, soiled from hand to hand; This lady's man, this curled effeminate fop, His velvet bonnet on his empty pate; This swaggering bravo with the well-oiled tongue That clatters in his mouth like a bell-hammer With empty jargon, bare unmeaning noise? Teresa. Now I have heard you to the end. I hold This bravo better than your pedagogue, His jargon less unmeaning than the other's. Keep to your choice, and let the world choose too. When I make mine, I shall not envy yours, Nor use detraction, envy's instrument. Farewell! [Exit Teresa. Fausta. Yesterday's drudge is empress of to-day. Pride is a mushroom grows up in a night, And quickliest ever in the foulest soil. Well, we may thank God, beauty and true wealth, Worth in a friend, and happiness in life, The fairest art, the noblest of deeds done Bear difference to different men. So all Have scope and running, where if all agreed We should have small agreement else, I wot, But one man be the sought of womankind And torn to pieces in their rivalry, While now, who flouts at a philosopher, Your lady, may go marry with her cook, And the sage make requital of the loss With the cook's cast-off scullion love, and each Shall deem that choice the nobler. Be it so. Enter Raolfo. Most welcome cousin, I have news for you. Raolfo. Nay, you have none. There is no news for them Who have made peace with hope and with despair. Such men dwell in a dim enchanted wood Of broken moonlight, shut out from the world, Where round and through their life's main memories, Like trees, their circling windy thoughts make moan; Trees fixed they see mid ever-eddying air, They only hear the rushing of the wind; And the all-vital things of healthsome men, Who live and hope, these in their sanctuary Hear like dim noises of the outer world, Faint buzzings of the far-off murmuring town, Dull dreary boomings of the distant sea, All meaning lost by distance. Fausta. You make hope Too cheap to barter it at second hand Ere it be worn out: and you rest it on Too weak foundation, building it on love, Or on the shifting sand of maid's caprice. Raolfo. Chide me not, cousin. Let me have your news. Fausta. My news is—that a horse brought forth a hare; An eagle left his paths of soaring strife To strut gold-feathered at the homestead door; A lion, weary of ranging after prey, Came fawning on the hands of men for food; The wild ox bowed his horned head 'neath the yoke Of his own will, and drew the plough for hire. Raolfo. Tell me no fables. I am sick at heart. Speak plainly. Fausta. Then a man put off his manhood, And bowed him to a woman, and became Such as the many who have nought of man Saving the outward shape and counterfeit. Raolfo. You speak of me? Fausta. Indeed, good friend, I do; Choose whom you will to make your duteous wife, And feel no shame for honest passion's cause, But be no sickly lover, for God's grace. Leave that to us poor women. Raolfo. You hit hard, And on the unshielded side between the plates. Fausta. Pluck out the steel. Set Reason on her throne, And make desire her footstool. Root out pity For others or thyself. Give thought her food, And turn the forces of thy life that way, So shall there be none left to feed disease; For love is but a canker of the soul, That eats up all her honest nutriment, And yields no recompense, a spongy weed That sucks the juices from the thirsting flowers, And leaves them choked with drought. Raolfo. You speak but fact. I am ashamed. Fausta. And I ashamed for thee, And pitiful. Raolfo. Why pitiful? Fausta. For this. Thou hast so fallen for nought. Teresa loves. Raolfo. For nothing, and she loves? Fausta. She loves not thee. If I may speak, not as an eye-witness Of how they met, but guessing by clear signs, Scarce had her eyes, which ofttimes turned from yours (How wearily indifferent!), as men, Born blind to beauty, turn from peerless art, Or from brief gazing on a sunset sky, Lit on the stanger, the pert courtling imp, Than like two bees they ransacked all his face For honey, and she drew nectar from his lips To treasure in the hive of memory. Her breath was bated while she spake, her cheek Red as of one who talks with loftier souls, Abashed and reverent her mien and gesture. What, jealous! Be this rather but thy cure, Learning how deep a spirit hath thy love, How keen perception ground and whetted on, How stern self-judgment to how fine an edge For probing others, how high sense of truth, Of reason, virtue, manhood, modesty, True breeding. Raolfo. Peace! You burn, and chafe the sore— First lay me low, then trample on my pride, Harrow with heavy censure that sown sneers May strike more root. You speak you know not what In jealousy. Fausta. What of Teresa, sir? Envy comes not to greater hearts from less, And jealousy to great minds not at all. Raolfo. You speak in hatred then. Your tale, forsooth, Rings credible of those but met an hour! A sole short hour! I do not trust it, no, Not in a single word. Fausta. In brief, I lie! Flatter thee not, friend, that for love of one Thrice truer than thou art, nay, even wast Before this folly, I could learn to lie. Whom measure you me by? Is it yourself, Or your Teresa? Go to her and see If this I say be fact. Meanwhile farewell. [Exit Fausta. Raolfo. Malignant woman, treacherous, traitorous, false! What is a man's hate for his brother man Beside a woman's for her sister frail? As well a judge might vouch the witnessing Of one who testifies against a foe, As I believe this partial satirist. Yet it disturbs my peace, as, whiles, the word Of a known liar somewhat moves deep faith In provèd innocence. The doubt I'll clear— But dread the truth more than to keep my fear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene.—The same—A Room in Zenora's House. Teresa. And do you really love me? Ilario. Ay, dear child. Teresa. I have a strange thought. Ilario. Why, what is it, love? Teresa. I fancied—'twas but fancy—for a moment You could not love me. Ilario. Why so? Teresa. Love, I said, Soars heavenward like sweet incense ever, akin To gratitude, and worship, and despair. At least 'tis so I love thee. Ilario. Well, what then? Teresa. You could not then love me, being more than I. Ilario. My happiness is perfect. I have hoped For love like this from when I first was man. Teresa. Are you so happy? Ilario. Yes. Teresa. Then you have stolen My happiness and added to your own. I am less happy than uneasy. Ilario. Wherefore? Teresa. Lest you should tire of me. Ilario. How should I tire? Teresa. I am so foolish, such a tedious child. Ilario. What, love? (Aside) Why, now this conquest passes all. I would my friends could see this lovely girl, How she adores me. They would burst with envy, And never more dare rival me again.— That makes me like you more, sweet innocence. Teresa. How so? Ilario. Because you are not proud and vain Like wittier women with a nimbler tongue. Teresa. Well, you have wit's full rations for us both. Mine shall all go to help love thee enough. The task, I fear me, will absorb it all, Nay, prove too vast for all the powers I own, Since, if I but half pay my debt of love, Nor time nor strength will serve for aught beside; I must be like a nun to prayer devote, That has no thought for earth. Ilario. What! pray to me? Teresa. Ay, what saint better? Ilario. Why, your pretty self. Teresa. Nay, I must have a hero for my prayers. Ilario. Am I a hero? Teresa. Greatest ever lived In my sight; and, I doubt not, in the world's, If it saw truly. Ilario. Here is one at last Who knows me, and who rates at my true worth! Sweet girl, be thou the first to earn the praise Of saying thus. Teresa. I shall lay claim to it When none can doubt its truth. Ilario (aside). Ah, were they here, My rivals! Never was a man so loved. To think it all is wasted and none sees it!— Come, sweetest lady, let us go and talk In the rose-arbour, of our two months' love. Your zealous guardian ever seeks us out And separates, upon some small pretext: There we are safest,—curse his prying eyes! [Exeunt. Enter Guido and Nita. Guido. Come this way, fair lady. Not a soul about. We may promenade in seclusion for an inconsiderable interval. Nita. Tell me again, dearest; do you love me? Guido. I tell you in sincerity, you have melted a heart never vanquished before. I have been gay and heartless, less loving than loved: but now I succumb to the humiliating flame. And you, I need not ask if you love me? Nita. Of course I do. Guido. Of course. I never failed yet. All women love me. But I hear footsteps approaching. Let us retire. [Exit Guido and Nita. Enter Zenora and Raolfo. Zenora. Fear not, my son, but he will quickly go, And plague you with his rivalry no more. Raolfo. But then,—Teresa?— Zenora. Son, you know not woman. What should a girl do when her sweetheart flits And proves a sorry jilt, forsaking her? Break heart and die? Why, if she have a heart Then she may break it, true; but having one, Let her be called some other name than woman, Being more devious from the ruts of nature Than a hot-blooded fish, flesh-eating ox, Or lion ravenous upon herbs and fruit. What should she do, I say, but cast about To find another and console her loss? Raolfo. So you would have me fill a widowed heart, And crawl in as an afterthought, for lack Of better. Zenora. No, my son, or yes. Choose you. No, if your choice were fit, the chosen worthy. But then I should not need advise, for such Had taken or left you, and no change of will In either case. But yes, if you would choose A slight mean will to couple with your own, For then 'twould be but fitting punishment. In brief, I wish that that which is, abide; That that which shall be, shall be; and that nature Continue in her course now as of old. I cannot pity you if you will thrust Your hand into the mangling iron wheel Men call necessity; nor need I praise If you will use that wheel to turn your mill And grind the corn of your felicity. Choose you. Raolfo. My mother, 'tis to thee I owe What sterner metal plates my heart with proof: But sweet Teresa is not of the type Whence nature copies vulgar womanhood. I do not think that, having once loved him, She would, e'en if I wished it, turn her love On me. Zenora. Love blinds you. For this first of times I see your judgment (winged by thought's rebound From mighty tension of the strong bent mind Upon its whizzing way, but lest that flight Should overshoot the target, fletched with plume Of steadying and retarding doubt) fly wide. Why, you were wont to weigh with weights minute, In scales that doubted the beam's trembling will, That not a sandy granule 'scaped the test, The gold and dross of all men's character; And, if you erred, 'twas like a trafficker Who buys the precious dust from swarthy hordes Upon the burning Ethiopian coast:— You reckoned less, than truth turned out, the gold A cautious judge. But now you overshoot The target, and the tree to which 'tis nailed, And the whole wood, and your spent shaft comes down A rod beyond. Indeed, I am amazed. Raolfo. Nay, mother, you but wrong my judgment, and The lady. For the former, it is naught. The other is a cruel thing. Zenora. Well, see. And if she prove not but the shallowest heart That ever gave love for a string of beads, Nor bring some shame on you and all of us, Then tell me (and you may then, as I marvel That you should now, with an unblushing face Or credulous) that this weak ill-governed girl Is worth your fretting. Raolfo. Think not but of me. A little think of her. If you believe This gallant means an honourable suit, Then you deceived me,—pardon, for I mean But such deceit as from the self-deceived Issues like plague into another's eyes, Pure truth being purposed,—saying he would quit, And leave the field to me. If you believe He means not so, why, duty then speaks clear. 'Tis a hard task for me to say this thing, Since it may seem 'twas for my profit. Zenora. Son, What would you have me do? Raolfo. Mother, you know. Zenora. Bid him begone? You are silent. Well, what then? Rouse strife betwixt our friendly families All for this girl? Insult this gentleman All to withhold temptation from the heart Which else were tried by touchstone, so that you Should take untested and believe it pure What tested would have fallen? Am I then To be the instrument to find my son A wife unworthy and against my wish, That, soaring higher, still finds no equal yet For my son's merit or my count of it, All that a stranger's path be made more smooth Of stumbling-blocks that others have to pass And do pass every day? Raolfo. Ah, talk not so, Or for this first of times force me confess You, you are cruel; you, my mother, you Who have so—loved me. Zenora. Yes, and love you still, And now am working for your good; but you Repay my love with this ingratitude, Which would that rather I had died that day When, you first wailing met my gaze, than prove; And let a stranger, one that loves you not, And shows by biting now my hand that fed her, In biting yours, that she for grateful care Is well matched with you, and what manner wife, How sweet, how thankful she will prove for love, Be an impediment betwixt our wills; And when I spurn it from my way, you turn And curse me. Raolfo. Now my mother is unjust. I never cursed you; no, nor never shall Whate'er you do to me, and worse than this You cannot do. Yet must I not forget, In honouring you, my duties to this maid, So brought up with me as she were my sister; And if you will not warn her, or remove The cause, then, hateful as my act may show And gross, yet I must warn her. Zenora. 'Twill come well. The cast-off suitor, out of sheer goodwill, Warns the deluded maiden of the villain, His more accepted rival. 'Twill come well. [Exit Zenora. Enter Fausta. Fausta. Eavesdroppers, by the proverb, should not hear Harm of their enemies, but of themselves; But I have heard— Raolfo. Why, this is fortunate. I sought my mother's help, but failing her Would next have prayed for yours, but that the service Could scarce be well explained by me to you. But now that you know all, the task is easy. Do this for me, dear cousin. Fausta. No, not I. Your pattern of all virtue needs no help, And least of all should come to me, your scorn. Watch her and mark the issue: then applaud Your wise choice and her constancy of soul. Raolfo. A noble woman now would put by hate And jealousy, and fence with woman's love Her weaker sister and sweet sympathy. Fausta. So think not I, and scorn such offices Of maudlin pity. Let the weak go down. It is the law with men. Why not with us? Raolfo. Why, then, I must e'en do the thing myself. Fausta. Do then, fair knight of dames, and earn her thanks. And see, fate wills you show yourself a fool. [Exit Fausta. Enter Teresa. Raolfo. Welcome, dear friend, if you allow the name. I was about to seek you. Teresa. Sir, I thank you, But this is too much honour. Raolfo. Nay, dear friend, The time is past for sneers and compliments, Idle alike and born of idle tongues. I would befriend you all that in me lies In a great matter. Teresa. Well, speak on. I hear. Raolfo. Will you not help me say what I should say? Teresa. What! will you have me court myself for you? This over-bashfulness is a new toy: Time was you were not burdened with it, sir. Raolfo. Last time my task was clear, straightforward, open, And every manful heart leaps forth to such. Now it is otherwise. Teresa. Come you to me With aught may not be uttered face to face, With undrooped eyes and with unstammering lips? A blush had suited, if a blush were yours, The words you spake that time. You cannot now Bring aught less acceptable. Speak, then. Raolfo. Friend, I wooed you for myself. You said me nay. 'Twas well, for so you wished it: nought remained For one not stinted of his proper pride. But when I forced my heart renounce that joy, I swore that who would reap it should be worthy: I swore it. Shall this warning be enough? Teresa. No, sir, it shall not. You shall not insult My youth with hints and warnings: but speak out Whate'er you have in mind, in manful sort, In clear words, not to be misunderstood. Raolfo. Well then, you love Ilario? Teresa. So you say. But what of that? Raolfo. He is not worthy you. Teresa. Sir— Raolfo. Let that pass. I came not to accuse Your choice. Teresa. You were best not. Ilario Is twice the man you are. Raolfo. That may be. Teresa. Ay, It is so. Turn your insults upon him, And learn how he will brook them. Raolfo. Hear me out In patience, for I came not to dispute Or match my worth with worth of other men. Ilario is your choice. That is your matter: But this I will not suffer, not endure, That he should make his sport of you and us. My mother feared it: Fausta fears it: both Refused, though I should kneel to them, to speak. I then, howe'er it please you, must make bold To warn you of your peril, ere too late. Teresa. Sir, you astound me! Words break down beneath My answer. You outgrow all insolence. You have no gentle blood. Say this to him, And take his answer in your teeth. Raolfo. Teresa— Teresa. You hereby call him traitor; me impure! Raolfo. Not so. I call him traitor, but you pure. Teresa. Tell him as much. Raolfo. I have. Teresa. And he said— Raolfo. That Which, for, howe'er I may despise the man, I cannot deem him equal to a lie, I do believe the truth—else had I struck him— And would have still remain the truth, to which I bade him pledge his honour, or depart. He neither swore, and for the rest appealed To her who took his part, my mother: then I threatened him: and now I have warned you. Both which, were you another, I had done For duty's cause: how much more then for love? I loved you once: I'll guard you, sweet, for ever. Teresa. I need no guardians, thank you, but my virtue And true Ilario's sword. Raolfo. The event shall show. But if you need, count on me to the death. Meanwhile still hate me. Since love cannot be, I do accept thy hate. I'll pay it back With ever-constant love. 'Tis better thus. I can endure hate, but indifference—no, From any heart, and least of all from thine. [Exit Raolfo. Teresa. How came they all so to suspect the truth? We must be swift now, or we are betrayed. To-night it must be. 'Tis not safe to wait. I will on the instant seek Ilario, And tell him this. He cannot wed with me, I see it all too well, a poor mean maid, Too far divorced in station and in birth From her who should aspire to wear his love As a proud bridal wreath. Yet, why for that Need he neglect my wild-flower coronal, Or I not stoop to be his own heart's bride? Her he shall deck in silks, and me in praise: To her give courtesy, to me the grace Of undisguised and frank familiar love: From her keep secrets, yield them up to me: Share wealth with her, give me his whole great heart: Keep her at court, me in some lowly cot. All dedicate to love and liberty: Pass tedious months with her, sweet days with me: Quarrel with her, and make it up with me: Forget her present, absent think of me. This is my life, and I am well content. [Exit Teresa. Enter Livia and Basso. Basso. I tell you, torment me not. I am mad with jealousy. That a mustachioed stick of a fellow, like a bramble hung with sheep's wool, should undo me! Livia. Think not of her. If she prefer the rascal to the roebuck, that is her taste. Basso. A little bit of a canting court barber: a lackey that apes the manners of a fine gentleman (as if every solid honest fellow that works with his hands should not be above that!): a valet, with a dancing-master thrown into the bargain, to make up short weight! Livia. Yes, it is monstrous; but forget her. Basso. A lanky poplar-tree, with a tuft of leaves on the top of it: a mop, with its shock head in curlpapers: a skipping, sniggering, sniffling, shambling, bowing and scraping master of ceremonies for the kitchen! See the fellow smile, till you would think the ends of his mouth would meet behind and his head drop off! A pair of laths in a yard and a half of cloth, a limp washed-out shred of unstarched linen! Livia. Compose yourself, dear Basso. You are getting black in the face. Consider your size, and beware of the apoplexy, dear. Basso. Woman, what is it to you if I burst? Livia. Why, I shall lose half my husband. Basso. Your husband! Livia. Yes, did you not promise to wed me? Basso. No. There should be some equality in these matters. A wife, look you, is the yoke-fellow of her husband. Now, if we two were set to draw the plough, which, think you, would draw the heavier? A man should have a wife of his own weight, or as many wives as he can balance in the scales. Livia. But Nita is no heavier than I. Basso. Love is a rogue of a merchant. He puts lead in with his light goods, and passes them off on the unwary. Livia. Could you not love me? Basso. Not while I have a chance of Nita: but I think I could love any woman. Livia. If you marry me, sir, I will take care that you get no chance of showing your love for any woman. Basso. What! am I not big enough to share with some others? Livia. No; I want all my husband to myself, even if he does weigh twenty stone. [Exit. Basso. Then you are not the one for me, Mistress Flare-up. [Exit Basso. Enter Teresa and Ilario. Ilario. Then let us lose no time. But tell me, child, Can you, exchanging home and peace for me, Be happy in the barter? Teresa. Home—what home? I have no home but on thy loving breast. Ilario. Be ready then against the time of night. Then, e'er the hollow horns of the half-moon Pour in the cup of heaven their watery wine, Dispensing to the search a dangerous light, We must go far. Procure you some disguise To baffle keen detection. Wait for me Under the terrace at the garden end, Among the oleanders. Now farewell! Yet stay! 'Twere best we should start separate ways. Here's gold enough. I'll bid one wait for you With horses, and appoint him where to meet me Some miles upon the road. Nay, not a word. Farewell! It must be so, or not at all. [Exit Teresa. Ilario. I must not go with her, for that would bind My life to hers before the world too closely, And make men busy with my fair repute. Were she a cottar's child, 'twere different now,— But to remove her from this noble roof— It cannot be: the thing would get abroad. Then, too, a journey with her could but make Harder to bring about or break to her The severance inevitable at last. But she must go, and quickly, or her shame Will become manifest. I wonder now If this she says be fact, and they divine Somewhat already? Well, it may be so; And I must put a bold face on the matter, Though 'tis unfortunate. But no. It is A trick of hers to hasten on my plan: She hungered to flee hence, and fabled this To compass freedom some days earlier. If this be so, then all goes well. She flies. They raise a dust. Who knows the cause? Not I. What easier, then, than to wash hands of it And never see her more? I hope 'tis so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene.—The same. A Room in Zenora's House. Zenora. Well, well, the girl is gone. I feared as much. Perhaps 'tis best: this folly of my son Will wake to disillusion. Raolfo (entering wildly). Mother! Zenora. Son— Raolfo. Tell me, is't true? They say Teresa fled Last night. Zenora. Alas! my son, the news is true. That I should thaw a viper at my hearth To poison the repute of our fair house! Raolfo. I will go straight and kill this ruffian, Scenting him out o'er all the face of earth By the pollution following on his feet Until I find him. Zenora. Wherefore hunt so far? Raolfo. To seek Ilario. Zenora. Ilario! Why, he is even now within this house. Refrain yourself. Raolfo. What! can he dare to stay And brave out crime with bland and womanish smiles? Dares he defy me with his leering face Now he has brought this ruin on her life, Just as he lisped and languished in my sight With his cursed maddening sweetness to defy My jealousy? Zenora. Dear son, refrain yourself; Think—you have no sole proof of it. Doubt not If he 'twas worked in truth her shame and flight (Think not the one could 'scape my woman's eye This some while past, to lead me half scent out The other), he must needs have fled with her. Think, too, what was this maid to thee? Thy sister? That so, myself would bid thee slay the man. Thy bride or thy betrothed? I would approve. But now? Raolfo. Mother, this maid was all to me. Zenora. She dealt you but scant courtesy. Raolfo. So be it— Which what but nobler makes my care of her, And my revenge clears from the taint of self? Zenora. Makes it a laughter-stock, you mean. Raolfo. How, mother? Zenora. No man but may fight battles for his friend Howso ungrateful, or avenge the shame, His own blood's in a sister, though she hate him— Tasks by main love or kinship sanctified, But scarce in sole behalf throw down the gauntlet Of one who slighted him, below his rank, And 'neath his mother's roof of her own will Herself dishonoured with a stranger. Raolfo. Ay— There lies it,—'neath thy roof—the thing so done Insults both thee and me. Zenora. There now, my son, You touch more solid ground. But this young man Is of a family much loved by me (Whereas the girl was hateful to my sight). If, then, I can forgive him, as I shall, What cause in thee to meddle? Raolfo. Still much cause. He has insulted no less me than thee. Zenora. Son, I beseech you keep this matter still, And favour me, if but because your life Should not for so frail loss be hazarded. Raolfo. Mother, 'twas you that taught me scorn of life. Will you unteach me all nobility? Zenora. Well then, by thy obedience due to me, Let this thing sleep, I charge you, son. Raolfo. That debt Was paid up when I put on manhood's trappings. Zenora. Then for my love. Raolfo. Mother, I loved her more. My love to thee, though thine to me, less strong, Refused what late I asked, and, granted, might Have saved these troubles, yet my love to thee Would outcall duty with its thunder-voice, All duties save this one, whose loud command Makes that voice sound a small brook heard far off Among the mountains through the groaning pines. This must be, mother; speak no more of it. Zenora. Well, go your way. Recall too late my words. My part is done. I leave you to your will. [Exit Zenora. Raolfo. Would God my frenzy and pure ignorance Had not informed my mother of my purpose. She will seek means yet, now once 'ware of it, To spoil my end, nor rest through fear for me. Fool that I was! Enter Fausta. Fausta. Why, that is very true. I cannot now deny it. Raolfo. Is this time To taunt me for my folly, when you see I am scarce on the hither side of madness? Fausta. So you repent? Raolfo. Yes, for the mischief's cause, My pride, or at the least its help's prevention. When she so scorned me, had I stood off less, Kept silence and enwrapt me in myself, But made my suit, an humble suppliant, I, through more frequent habit of approach, Might, howso oftener slighted, more abased, Have learned this sooner, in time to guard her peace. Fausta. Oh most magnanimous hero! Raolfo. Cousin, go And leave me to my own sad company. You cannot heal me with these bitter drugs, If such your will be, nor one whit the more Inflame the canker eating out my heart, If such your aim be rather, having changed Your love for hate. Fausta. Not you, but her I hate. Did I not prophesy of this? Raolfo. You did. A better and more a Christian's part had been To reach your hand out, the sole way to stop The shame that then was doing, than rejoice So in it done, and dance on her soul's grave. Fausta. Nay, 'twas but fair my rival of herself Should keep, e'en as I would, her virtue clean, Or losing it, confess my loftier stand. Raolfo. They who have never known temptation boast, And call it conquered by main will. Fausta. Try, then, The fieriest temptation of my soul, And, for thou only hast the power to tempt me, All others I but scorn, exert thy power, And fiercer bliss enticed not those of old To sin with angels, when the sons of God Came down to earth taken with golden hair, And see how I, a woman, can resist. Raolfo. 'Tis you now that would tempt, if I had will. Fausta. Nay, what I mean I say; I would withstand E'en thee. Raolfo. But 'twas not I that tempted her. Fausta. And was he more alluring? Raolfo. Ay, to her. Fausta. Not more to her than thou to me. Why, how Could love like mine invade so shallow soul, E'en for an equal object? And but weigh,— Heaping that difference with the difference 'Twixt thee and him, the objects of our love, A wider gulf than heaven from Erebus,— The stress of storm upon our several souls, And then think how my love is more than hers. Yet I would tear it with my heart-strings forth, And fling it in the face of the live hope That bore it ere dishonour came near me Or stooped to base incontinence my pride. Raolfo. 'Tis easy so to talk. Our own deep minds Are as a book laid open to our eyes, But writ in characters of a strange tongue Imperfectly known to us. We can read, As by dim light, the motives of our deeds, Say this we did for this, that for that cause; Here two conflicting storm-winds shook our hearts; The mightier conquered, but the weaker's power Was not in vain; the victor storm fared on, But not that way it started, and the blast Shaped its changed course betwixt the opposing roads: Here on another part some five or six Pent blasts contended in a straitened space For egress, and we knew that they must pass Along that path where least obstruction stood; But where that path lay till they searched it out We knew not. Thus imperfectly we read The book of our own minds. There is another Writ in a tongue whereof the alphabet Is yet to learn—a book, if opened to us, We could not scan a line of—and that book Is further shut and clasped with brazen clasps, And sealed up from us. It is called by name The mind of other men. Fausta. To what end this? Raolfo. To this end: and the moral is, if stale, Still precious—“Judge not, thou shalt not be judged.” Who knows thee as thyself? Thou dost an act, And dimly knowest wherefore. She did this— Thou canst not know wherefore or to what end. Fausta. So be it. Let her go. But of my mind You grant me some dim knowledge, and I know That I would not do so. Raolfo. Not in her place? Fausta. Not in her place and with my proper soul. Raolfo. But there, there lies the issue. In her place Means having her same feelings, thoughts, and power, Her judgments both of general right and wrong, And thather special deed, her life, her love, Her memories, the traditions of her blood And silent heritage of all her sires, And last, her so forlorn and orphan state. Fausta. If that be all, I grant your thesis proved. But see how little is the sum of it— If I were she, I should have done as she! I do not doubt it: did not from the first. But I am not, and never could be, such; And being as I am I would keep chaste. Your long excuse, sir, is too wide: it covers The whole sin of the world. We asked not this, If all sin be done freely, or proceed From tyrannous fates, from nature of each man, Who cannot be but as he is. Waive that. Madness doth breed avoidance in mankind, Yet is no fault of madness. Ugliness Is water to the fiery kiss of love, And yet is born with men and women. Sin Is hateful equally with all these things E'en though the sinner could not help but sin. Men shun the mad, the hideous, surely then Far more the sinner. There be sane and fair And sinless folk enough. Why choose the worse, The better put aside? Raolfo. The sum whereof Is this, that Fausta is a better maid Than sweet Teresa. Yet I know not this. There be frail women in the streets, I hear, Who, if all virtues were well reckoned up And balanced fair, and the excess of good Or evil taken as in judging men, So also in women ('stead of which, mankind And womankind, with purblind idiot eyes Seeking one virtue in a woman's heart, Judge by that sampler-proof of all things there) Would fairer show than many a dainty dame Whose milk-white honour never knew a spot. Brave, generous, kind, frank, honest, and unchaste, They blush, frowned into shame by hardened eyes Of sisters cowardly, ungenerous, harsh, Deceitful, false in word and act, but chaste. Fausta. Opinion seems the child of circumstance. But I have ever thought as you do now On this: yet where no other virtues shine Conspicuous, and the full-summed complement Shows small, there we demand, at least of asking, Courage in man, in woman chastity, The commonest twain, and most of nature's making, And easiest virtues,—nay, the other of which Seem vice unnatural,—and the most in need. Raolfo. Opinion seems the child of circumstance. But this she did was not unchastity Save in the blear eyes of the world. Fausta. Most true. But mark the issue in her feeble soul. She will not love him long: and so, love gone, Will drift an oarless and a sailless boat Upon the crossing tides of many lusts, Desire the steersman, self-contempt the goal. Raolfo. This is to prove yet. Prophecy is dead. The future is but known to God, and you But guessing at that second book I spake of. The world to come is child of the world now, An offspring like its parent. If we knew What is, then we should know what is to be, And be as God: but now we grope in night. Ponder this well, and learn more charity. Meanwhile I leave you. [Exit Raolfo. Fausta. Oh supreme, calm, scorn! How godlike! How he grappled with my mind And cast it panting, and then passed away With that still look of pale indifference! Love other women cringing flatteries, And give their hand for fawning dogs to lick, Looking to be befooled with yielding ways; If false then hateful, and if true then weak. Give me that man who teaches me, though strong, That I am weaker, sets his kingly foot Upon my will's neck, and so passes forth Indifferent. But here comes Iscariot. Enter Ilario. Ilario. Fair lady. Fausta. Come not with your smooth false looks, I love them not. Where is Teresa? Ilario. Nay— I know not. Fausta. Know not? Have you sought? Ilario. Why sought? Fausta. Ten thousand reasons. 'Twere more meet for you To hide your face here than thus brave the truth Set in the eyes of all of us. Begone! Take hence your odious presence. Ilario. Lady fair— Fausta. Lay my advice to heart. Meanwhile farewell. [Exit Fausta. Ilario. How queenlike! Why, this maiden frankly speaks As a man might, and yet so proudly pure As I have known her! How far different From that poor bashful yielding child! Till now I have found women weaker still than me, Have led them, loved them, scorned them all the while, And found ere long the scorn consume the love Impetuously, and bare mild pity left. But this imperious heart takes hold on mine In an embrace more equal; strikes and scorns Where others flattered, spurns where others lured. By Heaven, it spurs both love and pride to life, Love to possess so high a heart, and pride To quell a pride that trampled now on mine! I will subdue this woman. I will crush Her manlike will—and then high ecstasies! What bliss to clasp a serpent grown a dove! What high delight to feel resistance, burn, To hate and then to love, to maddening love, And torture sweetly all her conquered frame! 'Tis like the pride of breaking a wild steed That never bowed his neck to other lord, To mount and know that saddle safe to us Scarce safer to another than the brink Of tallest crag or topmost treacherous branch Of some sky-reaching tree. It must be done. Why, I begin to love with thinking thus: Nay, I do think, for all my boastful strain, I could become this woman's slave. Thy slave! Forfend it, Heaven! And yet that fierce embrace Were worth e'en crouching for. Yes, I would give Pride, honour, all things else, for but one kiss Of lips so lofty. I have sometimes heard Of mighty women whom a man might love With soul's devotion. Surely here is one. But I must quell her or subdue myself; This sudden thirst is more unbearable Than famine. I must prove free man again One way or other shortly, and I will. [Exit Ilario. Enter Livia and Basso. Basso. Pester me not. Livia. Why, husband? Basso. I say, pester me not. I married you of sheer weakness, to escape hearing your tongue persuading me to it. And now I hear more of it than ever. Livia. Have I ever spoken unkindly to you? Basso. No, that's it—always like a sick dove cooing. It makes my gorge to rise. Sweet cowslip-ball—dear little mountain—tender feather-bed—I have them all by heart. Enter Nita. Here's Nita—here's the girl I should have had. Livia. You are very cruel. Basso. Oh, be off with a plague! This ceaseless jarring makes me grow thin. [Exit Livia. Nita. How now? Your wife in tears? You are a precious husband, sir! I had a good escape at least. Though for that, I fare not so much better. Basso. Poor girl! Is he, then, unkind to you? 'Tis monstrous cruelty, you being his wife. But I pity you. I am sorry; indeed I am. Nita. Fins off, porpoise! Do you think that because my husband is cold to me you are to be allowed liberties? A pretty substitute! But you men are all alike. You neglect your own wives, however comely, and must come running about after other men's. Leastways, my husband does: and the example is not lost on you. Basso. And you women are all alike. You make a man's head swim at home with your jargoning, and when he looks abroad you fall a-weeping. Nita. That shows we love our husbands. Better weep than do worse. Basso. When your mind is fully set to forbear weeping, give me early notice. Nita. Well, I shall weep no more. Basso. Why, then, do worse—better, I should say— smile on your Basso. [Goes on his knees. Enter Guido. Guido. What scoundrel's here! Begone, balloon, or I will take a bodkin and let you out! Away, sperm-whale! [Kicks him out. Basso. Be gentle, sir. My skin blisters easily. Guido. And you, vile woman! Nita. Husband— Guido. Why do you suffer that blow-fly to buzz love to you? Nita. I did not. But suppose it waived that I did, how many women do you make love to? You leave me night and day alone. Guido. I doubt not you are cheerier company to yourself than to me. Nita. Dear husband— Guido. Oh begone! Nita. No, let me stay by you a little. Guido. Begone, I say! Enter Raolfo. Raolfo (aside). So is it ever. One heart bleeds to death For a little love. The other gives it none. What! Guido, Nita, quarrelling so soon? Guido. Save your lordship, 'tis nothing. Nita. Ay, sir, he speaks truth. He is a good husband to me. Raolfo. See, bear this letter to your master, sirrah, And say who gave it you, and that it brooks No long delay in the perusal. There, Bring me his answer. Lose no time. Begone! Guido. Ay, sir, I'll go with it at once. Come, wife. [Exeunt Guido and Nita. Raolfo. He must accept. I have so worded it That he may know the charge my mind prefers Against him, without word of her. That name I could not bear to couple with such thoughts. Moreover, I have never known him loth To any deed of manhood. Enter Fausta. What! returned? Fausta. Ay. On the stairs but now I met his man, Ilario's man. He bore a letter sealed. I guessed it came from you and what is said, And I am come to thank you in the name Of all our house. Raolfo. For what? Fausta. For this just act Toward one who put an insult on our name. Whate'er her worth (we will not wrangle more), She dwelt beneath our roof. You are most right, And I am come to thank you. Raolfo. Spare your thanks. I did but what seemed just to me and best. Fausta. And therein did but that you ever do— True to yourself and us. Raolfo. And what is here For thanks? You make yourself too busy with My secret dealings. All I do is known, As soon as done, to you. It is not fit A young maid should so closely watch a man. Men's lives are not most commonly the books For maids to study in. Fausta. There you speak true. But your life is not as another man's, Or, as I scorn such lives, so should I it, And give but scanty study. But here comes Ilario's man. The rogue is expedite. Enter Guido. Raolfo (opens letter and reads). A curse on him! (Dropping letter, Fausta picks it up.) Fausta. Why, how? He will not fight. So we must plume upon his other virtues The coward's honours. What a paltry soul! What manifest excuses! You, forsooth, Have never done him wrong, nor would he you. He knew not that the thing would anger you. The maid was not your sister, nor your mistress, And so forth. Take my counsel. Raolfo. And it is? Fausta. Why, write again. Say you will spit on him If he fight not. Yet I go far to loathe That you should cross swords with so dastard slave. Raolfo. My purpose and your word strike friendly hands. I go hence with the letter. (Showing another letter.) Fare you well. [Exit Raolfo. Fausta. He would have done this had he loathed the girl. A curse on her! the slight ungoverned life, To come 'twixt mine and that great heart of his. And for this smooth-lipped wretch—But see him come. Enter Ilario. Ilario. Empress, and will you chide me yet once more? Fausta. Why? Ilario. 'Tis so sweet, so better far than praise From meaner lips. Fausta. The law of love is still Like unto like. Mean lips and flattery Should better match thee than my chastisement. Ilario. But they do not. Lay on the lash again. Fausta. Each act you do should leave you happier If you love scorn of mine—a traitor first, A coward next—and now a woman's slave (If you speak fact, and I care not to know). You cannot sink much further. Ilario. Coward? When? Fausta. You sent Raolfo this. Ilario. Your cousin, then, Takes counsel on these matters with young maids; And with his mother too, perchance; and if He had a wife, would show his challenges To her, and crave advice. Fausta. Go to, vain fool! I snatched it from the floor where he let drop. Moreover, he well knows 'tis not my mood To bid him play the coward. Were I a man, By Heaven! I'd take thy chastisement myself, And deal it roundly. Ilario. You have done so now. All sins my doing towards your family Are by the pain you deal atoned for thrice. The selfsame words wherewith you tear my soul Make me but see your noble worth more clear And know what jewel I might once have earned But for this loathèd fault. Fausta. Be whole of heart— You never could have won me. Pay yourself All sleek self-compliments but that. Ilario. My queen, Leave me this tithe of comfort, but to think It might have been. Or, if your will run so, Take this too. Leave me nothing. I will go Comfortless to the grave, and feed upon Mine unrequited love for nutriment. To love you shall be all my happiness; And you shall hate me for my sole return. Fausta. I cannot hate nor love you—only scorn. To love you were as easy as to hate. I know not which I would the liefer do. I must not listen further to your talk. [Exit Fausta. Ilario. 'Tis clean as I foretold. I am her slave. I thought to crush her will: she supples mine. Her influence bowed me like an iron weight E'en as she spoke. But, for this fighting man, Her cousin, I must take his challenge up. She calls me coward for but pitying him. I must put off that pity in some part And write again. But grieved at soul I am To put his life in so much jeopardy. An honest man but strange! Thus do our sins Scruple to swallow the foul brood they spawn, But haunt us in their loathly progeny. And so the first rent runs right through the robe And leaves our life a ruin. Be it so! My conscience I can brave, but scarce her scorn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene.—A Grove near Zenora's House. Raolfo. Here is the place. Now spur thy coward's heart, Seducer, to confront infuriate love And high impartial Justice iron hand! This once they join, unwonted so to join, And both cry for thy blood. Ilario. It grieves me sore That you will draw this doom down on your head. I have no quarrel with you. For that deed— I do regret it just in so far forth As it grieves you. I would not add to it By taking of your blood. Raolfo. What! coward too! You should have cast the dangers of your suit Ere well in court. You are too far in the coils Now to slip forth from under punishment By fawning, grovelling, base apologies. If you have one drop of man's blood in all Your body, let it leaven so the rest That you be able to hold up your guard Untrembling. Ilario. Bookish fool, beware! and cease To more provoke me, lest my patience fail. But come, sir, are you a philosopher? And will you make a quarrel for a toy, A woman's heart, a trifle to change hands Weekly, the current coin of Cupid's mart? You should know more the frailty of their heart To deem this thing dishonour, and apprize At juster rate the value of such hearts Than make a fray about one, when 'tis lost. I too would fight over a woman's favour Before I won it or some other man, Not after, just as two cocks for the hen, Ready to fight as fiercely for a worm. Both are enjoyable, favour and food. And each would have them; therefore the two fight, No further said, when one has seized the prize. Raolfo. From the dung-heap. Thus men philosophize Who have no part in knowledge. Bare your sword. Small time for me to waste more words with you, And less desire: plead like the ass and horse With what brute strength you have; a dastard else, Lacking the virtue of the cross-bred cur, That quarrels for the offal in the street, Or of the barn-door fowl, your model— Ilario. Sir, You shall have fight enough, since so you must. Defend yourself. I pray you choose your ground. [They fight. Raolfo. Take that, and that. A curse on your cold blood To mock my rage with calm! Damned smiling devil, Take that! Have you no wrath, man, to be roused With all that lust you could not govern? Ha! That went home, did it? May this follow it. [Raolfo thrusting, runs on Ilario's point and falls. Ilario. Fool, angry fool, I told you 'twould be so! You have your death, I doubt. Raolfo. Get from my sight! I could curse God for failure of that thrust, And that I die so baffled. Kneel on me That I may reach your throat. One grapple more. Are you afraid of a weak dying man? Detestable, contemptible— Ilario. Rave on. I hear approaching steps. I must away. Blame but yourself. I meant you not this harm. God rest your soul. [Exit Ilario. Enter Fausta. Fausta. Just Heaven, what have we here? Raolfo. A strong hate unrevenged, God's greatest curse; A soul insatiate passing out of life Hard by the brink of the cool mocking wave, With nature's strongest thirst unslaked. Fausta. Good God! But let me find the wound. I can but bind it— I fear me there is no more to be done. My fault, my fault. I urged you on to this. I am the murderess of the man I loved. On me be all the blame. The deed was mine. Yet if you had but slain him, and could die, Justice accomplished, with an easy mind, I should not grieve the less, but less reproach My share in this. Forgive me, friend, forgive. I loved your honour better than your life; I wished to see you play the nobler part, As ever of yourself you did. If now I had to make for you the choice again, Of risk or death in hand with action high, Or baseness married to security, I think I should choose still as then. But see, This comes of it—death, and myself the cause. But ah, forgive me, noble, gentle heart! Raolfo. Will you still plague me with your amorous speech And boldness ever thus unmaidenly? My near-approaching death may plead excuse, But let this very thing refrain your tongue. I would have some short peace before my death To tune my mind to stillness of the grave. Fausta. Death is but little nearer thee than me. Have pity on me for my love. Raolfo. I have; For I too have much suffered from that cause. Fausta. Have pity on me; say ere yet thou die Thou lov'st me but a little, less perchance Than man ere loved a woman, but a little. Raolfo. Dear friend, you make me pity you; but love— I cannot love but her. Fausta. What! her your shame? Raolfo. Who spake thus of her—who has dared? Nay, friend, I am almost spent. Pray let me pass in peace. I would not be provoked to wrath, and die Cursing. I would not grieve thee with harsh words For speaking thus of her. I pity thee. There, leave me, in God's name. Fausta. I will not leave. I will love her for thy sake, nay, will strive To honour her. But say thou lov'st me now Only a little, for my love, my faith, My meek obedience, nay, if these be slight, The life which I will soon pour over thee As wine upon thy funeral—a little, Only a little, the least drop of love Lips ever tasted or heart ever gave. It will be to my tongue as the sweet drop Of water Dives prayed for in hot hell. I am grown one great famine, fever, drouth, Nay, hell itself, with thirsting for thy love. Raolfo. You would not have me lie to you, poor friend? I cannot love you. Fausta. Good God! Say not so. I would God you had died first ere those words, Those last words,—as I soon shall die, and rest. But yet, but yet I have a little boon. Be not so cruel but to give it me, If I ask meekly. Raolfo. What is this you ask? Fausta. To kiss me. Let me die upon thy lips. Or if this be too much, to kiss me once, And so bid farewell to my flitting soul. Raolfo. I would be loth to keep this trifle back If boon it be, or aught of comfort give— Fausta. Comfort! It is my life, my all, my heaven. Raolfo. But I have sworn, I swore thou knowest when, That never woman's lips should touch mine own. Thou wouldst not have me dying be forsworn Who ever kept my word through life? Fausta. Nay, true. Though thy kiss were the gate of heaven, if thou Hadst sworn to hold it back from lips of mine, I would go rather down to hell than break Thy knightly word or oath, and so deface My life's true hero. Raolfo. Noble woman,—why Have I been ever blind to thy great soul? I may not kiss thee, but take this my hand. I cannot love thee, but I honour thee. Fausta. It is enough. Come, peace! [Stabs herself.] Here will I lie. My body is too frail to hold this love— This great love that torments me. Thus and thus I give it vent to mingle with the winds, To break from the cold clay, a soul set free To wander with the tempests of the night. Enter Teresa. Teresa. I wonder have they slain him that he came not? I will not yield to grief till I have vengeance. Or they may but have charged him to the Duke. But what is here? A man. Alas! too late. Dead, dead! my loved one, my Ilario! And who art thou, cursed woman, to be graced With touch of his dead hand? Off, off! I say. Ilario! Raolfo. Is it an angel speaks, Deluding my dulled ear with strains of heaven In likeness of the sweetest strains on earth? No—it is she—in death brought back to me. Poor wanderer! I still love thee. Kiss me, love. Fausta. Would that the mists of death would blind these eyes. Teresa. Raolfo! 'Tis Raolfo. Wicked man, Where is my love? Are you his murderer? Fausta. Base harlot! your vile minion slew this man, Worth more than thousands of his bastard breed. Raolfo. Fausta, you have forgot. Words such as these But ill beseem lips soon to close in death; And I would sooner hear the saints blasphemed Than her thus chidden. Teresa. Spare your courtesy. I need it not. But tell me, where is he? Raolfo. That way he went. Teresa. Then true it is he slew you? Raolfo. As I had slain him if I could. Teresa. You have— For he must die or leave the land for this. Why must he spread his eagle-wings and stoop On such a thing? Poor slave, what is thy life That he should honour thee with taking it, Or that its loss should harm a hair of his? Fausta. I cannot bear it. Most ungrateful wretch, For this he died, died to avenge thy shame! Raolfo. No word of that, or by great Heaven— Fausta. Oh God! Teresa. My shame! insulting man. What shame have I? Or what is it to you to search my ways? Who gave you charge over my chastity? Or who has taught your manhood to defame A lady's honour with such words? Raolfo. Enough! Spare me. I cannot bear it. Teresa. Spare thee what? Raolfo. Have not I lived to worship thee? Have not Mine eyes, lips, thoughts, hands, nay, my very soul, Been thine to take or cast away? Forbear, Forbear these cruel words. Cruel they are, Crueller than death. And yet I love thee still. Thou art my better angel still; to me Pure as the day-spring, holier than heaven. Give me thy blessing ere I go— Fausta. Sweet God, Hasten my death! It loiters. O sweet saints,— Quick, quick—I cannot bear it. Teresa. Out on thee! Thou wouldst have slain Ilario, my dear love, Hast led him into crime and misery, And cravest now my blessing! Out on thee! Enter Ilario. Ilario. This way she came. Teresa. Ilario! Ilario. Stand off— Teresa. Stand off! Ilario (to Fausta). What's this? Infatuate, cruel girl, To spoil that temple where high beauty dwelt, To take thy loveliness from the dull heaven. Teresa. Just God! Ilario. Speak, speak, for yet I see thou art not dead. Why didst thou this? Fausta. Look on this murdered man. Who slew him? Ilario. I. Fausta. Why, then, didst thou slay me Ilario. I would he had drunk my life-blood first. Fausta. Too late. Thou, that wast all unworthy to be slain By such sweet hands, with thine ignobler ones Hast done this sacrilege. Ilario. Reproach me not. 'Tis done, and I repent for thy sweet sake. Yet what was he that thou shouldst love him so? A creature of poor spirit. Fausta. May thy mouth Be blighted and sealed up with leprosy! Ilario. Amen, since I have grieved thee. Teresa. I am stunned. Surely this is a dream. My brain is turned With all these horrors, and I live in dreams And picture that which is not. O sweet love, Come to me, and awake me from this dream, This ghastly, lying dream. Ilario, Come to my bedside wheresoe'er I am, And breathe on me, and wake me with a kiss, And say this is not true. Ilario. Out, strumpet, out! Thou art the cause of this. Raolfo. Oh for some strength To kill this villain! Love, he casts thee off. Turn now to me. I am the same—to death. Teresa. Ilario! Ilario. Out, strumpet!—dost not hear? I love thee not. Teresa. O God! then let me die. Kill me. Be quick and merciful. Raolfo. Dear love— She hears me not: her thoughts are all on him. Fausta. And his on her. Sweet God, have mercy—quick! Ilario. She clings to him in death. I am alone. Fausta, look up on me. Fausta. Traitor and slave! Teresa. Dost hear her? Love me still, Ilario; She will not love thee. Ilario. Why, dost mock at me? Teresa. Nay, God forbid! Sweet Fausta, pity me. Fausta. I pity thee! Look on this work of thine. Teresa. Nay, but thou must. [Drawing out Fausta's knife and stabbing herself. Thy pity is most sweet. Raolfo. Madman, support her. [Teresa falls. I shall die with her. Our spirits shall take wing at once. Who knows But when they quit together the frail husk Her eyes may open on the heavenly shore, And know me and my love? and she, thus clear Of mortal blindness, may forget this life, And love me even as I love her. Fausta. But then There is a third soul hungry and desolate Following your flight with ever-anxious eyes. Is no room for me in your Paradise? Am I shut out, I only? Raolfo. Speak, dear child. Teresa, wilt thou love me now? Teresa. No, never. I am going where no love is any more Sick of life's treachery. Yet, Ilario, I die your faithful slave. [Dies. Raolfo. God take my soul! [Dies. Fausta. He is gone. He thought not of me. On thy lips Thus will I breathe my life out;—Sweet, sweet death. [Dies. Ilario. Nor gave she thought to me:—and I alone Am left, sole author of this tragedy, The main first cause of all these aching griefs, Left to my own remembrance and contempt. No, never! Shall these women act great parts, And I forbear the Roman's death? Out, friend, My last true friend, and comfort my despair. [Enter crowd of Citizens. 1st Citizen. Murder! 2d Citizen. Seize on him; bind his arms. Ilario. Good friends, You do but delay justice. Have your will. Citizen. How his eyes rest on her! Citizen. Poor lady! Citizen. Ay. But wherefore did he slay her, or who slew? And who reft this one of his life? And here, Here lies Raolfo, noble gentleman, Dead too. All dead. 'Tis a mysterious business. 1st Officer. You, sir, how came it thus? 2d Officer. He hears you not; His eyes are fixed. See how he looks on her. 1st Officer. Come, tell us how the thing befell? Your words Can scarce make darker your suspicious case, But may do good. Ilario. What good? 1st Officer. Why, save thy life. Ilario. And if I do not wish to live? 1st Officer. Why, then, I know not. Ilario. Grant me, then, a little boon. 1st Officer. What? Ilario. Loose my hands a moment. 1st Officer. They are loosed. Ilario. Give me my sword. 1st Officer. Nay, it has done enough Of mischief for one day. Ilario. Then turn its point Towards my breast and strike. 1st Officer. Nay, justice strikes On deep consideration, not to ease The guilty wretch of life, when life is pain, Nor yet to rob him of the joy of breath, But calmly, for the good of civil life And common safety of mankind. Look you, I am no murderer. Ilario. As a starving man, A ragged beggar kneeling begs for bread, So I beg you for death. 1st Officer. It cannot be. You asked not this man if he wished for death: You slew him, taking law in your wild hands. Now you desire to die, insulted law Has no weak pity for you. You must live— At least a while. Lead off the prisoner. Take up these bodies, and convey them home.</field>
