      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF CROESVS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his Sacred Majestie. Disdaine not mighty Prince, those humble lines, Though too meane Musicke for so dainty eares, Since with thy greatnesse, learnings glory shines, So that thy brow a two-fold Lawrell beares: To thee the Muses, PhÅbus now resignes, And Vertues hight eternall trophees reares; As Orpheus Harpe, heavens may enstall thy pen, A liberall light to guide the mindes of Men. Although my wit be weake, my Vowes are strong, Which consecrate devoutly to thy name My Muses labours, which ere it be long, May graft some feathers in the wings of fame, And with the subject to conforme my song, May in more lofty lines thy worth proclame, With gorgeous colours courting glories light, Till circling Seas doe bound her ventrous flight. Ere thou wast borne, and since, heaven thee endeeres, Held backe, as best to grace these last worst Times; The World long'd for thy birth three hundreth yeeres, Since first fore-told wrapt in Propheticke rimes; His love to thee, the Lords deliveries cleeres, From Sea, from Sword, from Fire, from Chance, from Crimes, And that to him thou onely might be bound, Thy selfe was still the meanes foes to confound. I doe not doubt but Albions warlike coast, (Still kept unconquer'd by the heavens decree) The Picts expell'd, the Danes repell'd, did boast (In spite of all Romes power) a state still free, As that which was ordain'd (though long time crost In this Herculean birth) to bring forth thee, Whom many a famous Sceptred Parent bring: From an undaunted race to doe great things. Of this divided Ile the Nurslings brave, Earst from intestine warres could not desist, Yet did in forraine fields their names engrave, Whilst whom one spoil'd the other would assist: Those now made one, whilst such a head they have, What world of words were able to resist? Thus hath thy worth (great IAMES) conjoyn'd them now, Whom battels oft did breake, but never bow. And so, most justly thy renowned deeds Doe raise thy fame above the starry round, Which in the world a glad amazement breeds, To see the vertues (as they merit) crown'd, Whilst thou (great Monarch who in power exceeds, With vertuous goodnesse do'st vast greatnesse bound, Where, if thou lik'dst to be more great, then good, Thou might'st soone build a Monarchie with bloud. O! this faire world without the world, no doubt, Which Neptune strongly guards with liquid bands, As aptest so to rule the Realmes about, She by her selfe (as most Majesticke) stands, Thence (the worlds Mistris) to give judgement out, With full authority for other Lands, Which on the Seas would gaze attending still, By wind-wing'd Messengers their Soveraignes will. The Southerne Regions did all Realmes surpasse, And were the first which sent great Armies forth; Yet Soveraignty that there first founded was, Still by degrees hath drawne unto the North, To this great Climate which it could not passe, The fatall period bounding all true worth: For, it cannot from hence a passage finde, By roring Rampiers still with us confinde. As Waters which a masse of earth restraines, (If they be, swelling high begin to vent) Doe rage disdainefully over all the plaines, As with strict borders scorning to be pent: Even so this masse of earth, that thus remaynes, Wall'd in with waves, if (to burst out when bent,) (The bounding flouds o're-flow'd) it rush forth, then That deluge would o're-run the world with men. Then since great Prince) the torrent of thy power, May drowne whole Nations in a Scarlet floud, On Infidels thy indignation powre, And bathe not Christian bownds with Christian bloud: The Tyrant Ottoman (who would devoure All the redeemed souls) may be withstood; While as thy troups (great Albions Emperour) once Do comfort Christs afflicted flock which moanes. Thy thundring troups might take the stately rounds Of Constantines great Towne renown'd in vaine, And barre the barbarous Turks the baptiz'd bounds, Reconquering Godfreys conquests once againe; O, well spent labours! O illustrious wounds! Whose trophees should eternall glory gaine, And make the Lyon to be fear'd farre more, Then ever was the Eagle of before. But, O thrice happy thou that of thy Throne The boundlesse power for such an use controuls! Which if some might command to raigne alone, Of all their life they would be bloud the scrouls, And to content the haughtie thoughts of one Would sacrifize a thousand thousand souls, Which thou do'st spare, though having sprite and might, To challenge all the world as thine owne right. Then unto whom more justly could I give Those famous ruines of extended states (Which did the world of libertie deprive By force, or fraud, to reare Tyrannick seats) Then unto thee, who may and will not live Like those proud Monarchs borne to stormy fates? But whil'st frank-sprited Prince, thou this wouldst flee, Crowns come unsought, and Scepters seek to thee. Vnto the Ocean of thy worth I send Those runnels, rising from a rash attempt; Not that I to augment that depth pretend, Which heavens from all necessitie exempt, The Gods small gifts of zealous mindes commend, While Hecatombes are holden in contempt: So (Sir) I offer at your vertues shrine This little incense, or this smoke of mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Author of the Monarchicke Tragedies. Well may the programme of thy Tragicke stage, Invite the curious pompe-expecting eyes To gaze on present shewes of passed age, Which just desert Monarchicke dare baptize. Crownes throwne from Thrones to Tombs, detomb'd arise To match thy Muse with a Monarchicke theame, That whilst her sacred soaring cuts the skyes, A vulger subject may not wrong the same: And which gives most advantage to thy fame, The worthiest Monarch that the Sunne can see, Doth grace thy labours with his glorious Name, And daignes protector of thy birth to be: Thus all Monarchicke, Patron, Subject, stile, Make thee, the Monarch-tragicke of this Ile. S. Robert Ayton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jn praise of the Author, and his Tragedy of Darius. A Sonnet. Give place all ye to dying Darius wounds, (While this great Geeek him in his throne enstals, Who fell before seven-ported Thebes wals, Or under Ilions old sky-threatning Rounds. Your sowre-sweet voyce not halfe so sadly sounds, Though I confesse, most famous be your fals, Slaine, sacrific'd, transported, and made thrals; Thrown headlong, burnt, and banish't from your bounds: Whom Sophocles, Euripides have song, And Ãschylus in stately Tragicke tune: Yet none of all hath so divinely done As matchlesse Menstrie in his native tongue. Thus Darius Ghost seemes glad now to be so, Triumpht on twise by Alexanders two. Io. Murray.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument. At that time when the States of Greece began to grow great, and Philosophie to be thought precious, Solon the first light of the Athenian commonswealth, like a provident Bee, gathering honey over many fields, learning knowledge over many Countries, was sent for by CrÅsus King of Lydia, as famous for his wealth, as the other was for his wisedome. And not so much for any desire the King had to profit by the experience of so profound a Philosopher, as to have the report of his (as he thought it) happinesse approved by the testimonie of so renowmed a witnesse. But Solon alwayes like himselfe, entring the regall Palace, and seeing the same very gloriously apparrelled, but very incommodiously furnished with Courtiers, more curious to have their bodies deckt with a womanishly affected forme of rayment, and some superficiall complements of pretended curtesies, then to have their mindes enriched with the true treasure of inestimable vertue, he had the same altogether in disdaine. Therefore after some conference had with CrÅsus concerning the felicitie of man, his opinion not seconding the Kings expectation, he was returned with contempt as one of no understanding. But yet comforted by Ãsop (Author of the witty fables) who for the time was resident at Court, and in credit with the King. Immediately after the departure of Solon, CrÅsus having two Sounes (whereof the eldest was dumbe, and the other a brave youth) dreamed that the yongest dyed by the wound of a Dart, wherewith being marvellously troubled, he married him to a Gentlewoman named CÃ¦lia, and for farther disappointing the suspected, though inevitable destinie, he discharged the using of all such weapons as he had dreamed of. Yet who could cut away the occasion of the heavens, from accomplishing that which they had design'd. The spiritfull youth being long restrain'd from the fields, was invited by some Country-men to the chace of a wilde Bore, yet could very hardly impetrate leave of his loving suspicious Father. Now in the meane time there arrived at Sardis a youth named Adrastus, Sonne to the King of Phrygia, one no lesse infortunate then valorous, he having lost his Mistrisse by a great disaster, and having kill'd his brother by a farre greater, came to CrÅsus, by whom he was courteously entertained, and by the instancy of the King, and the instigation of others against his own will, who feared the frowardnesse of his infectious fortune, he got the custodie of Atis (so was the Prince called) whom in time of the sport, thinking to kill the Bore, by a monstrous mishap he killed. After which disastrous accident standing above the dead corps, after the inquiry of the truth, being pardoned by CrÅsus, he punished himselfe by a violent death. There after, CrÅsus sorrowing exceedingly this exceeding misfortune, he was comforted by Sandanis, who laboured to disswade him from his unnecessary journey against the Persians, yet he reposing on superstitious, and wrong interpreting responses of deceiving Oracles, went against Cyrus, who having defeated his forces in the field, and taken himselfe in the Citie, tyed him to a stake to be burned, where by the exclayming divers times on the name of Solon, moving the Conquerour to compassion, he was set at libertie, and lamenting the death of his Sonne, and the losse of his kingdome, gives a ground for this present Tragedie.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene in Sardis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 1. Solon. Loe, how the stormy world doth worldlings tosse, Twixt sandy pleasures, and a rocky will, Whil'st them that Court it most, it most doth crosse, To vice indulgent, vertues stepdame still: This masse of thoughts, this animated slittie, This dying substance, and this living shadow, The sport of Fortune, and the prey of Time, Soon rais'd, soon raz'd, as flowers are in a meadow. He toyles to get (such is his foolish nature) A constant good in this inconstant ill: âUnreasonable reasonable creature, âThat makes his reason subject to his will! VVhilst on the height of contemplation plac'd, I weigh fond earthlings, earnest idle strife, âAll (though they all have divers parts imbrac'd) âWould act a comicke Scene of tragicke life: âThe minde (which alwaies at some new things aymes) âTo get for what it longs, no travell spares; âAnd lothing what it hath of better dreames, âWhich (when enjoy'd) doth procreate but cares: âYet to a Soveraign blisse which they surmise, âBy divers meanes, all pregnant wits aspire, âBut with strange shapes the same so much disguise, âThat it we scarce can know, much lesse acquire: Some place their happinesse (unhappy beasts, Whose mindes are drunke with momentary joyes) In gorgeous garments, and in dainty feasts, To pamper breath-toss'd-flesh with pleasures toyes; Some more austere, no such delights allow, But reyne their passions with advis'd respects, And by no fortune mov'd to brag nor bow, Would make the world enamour'd of their sects; Some bathing still in vertues purest springs, Doe draw Ideas of a heavenly brood, And search the secrets of mysterious things, As most undoubted heires of that high good: Thus with a dream'd delight, and certaine paine, âAll seek by severall wayes a perfect blisse; And let none wonder though they toyle in vaine, Who cannot well discerne what thing it is, What happinesse can be imagin'd here, On painted grounds though we our hopes repose, Who dearely first doe gaine, what we hold deare, Then what we once must lose, still feare to lose? Thinke (though 'mongst thousands scarcely one of all, Can at this point of happinesse arrive) One fortune have (whilst so to fortune thrall) To get the thing for which a world doth strive: What though he swimme in Oceans of delights, Have none above him, and his equals rare; Eares joying pleasant sounds, eyes stately sights, His treasures infinite, his buildings faire? Yet fortunes course which cannot be contrould, Must mount some meane men up, throw down the great, And (still in motion) circularly rould, From what it is, must alter every state. âThough of his wealth, the greedy man doth boast, âWhil'st treasures vaine his drossie wits bewitch, âWhat hath he gain'd, but what another lost? âAnd once his losse may make another rich. âBut ah, all lose who seeke to profit thus, âTo found their trust on trustlesse grounds whil'st made: âWe may be rob'd from them, they rob'd from us, âGriev'd for their losse, as when first purchas'd, glad: âThose are but fooles, who hope true rest to finde âIn this fraile world, where for a while we range: âWhich doth (like Seas expos'd to every winde) âEbbe, flow, storme, calme, still moving, still in change; âEach wave we see doth drive the first away, âAnd still it whitest fomes where rockes are neare, âWhile as one growes, another doth decay, âThe greatest danger oft doth least appeare. âTheir seeming blisse, who trust in frothy showes, âWhose course with moments fickle fortune dates, âAs to a height, so to confusion growes: âA secret fate doth manage mighty states. But I scorne fortune, and was ever free From that dead wealth, depending on her power; My treasure still I beare about with me, Which neither time nor tyrants can devoure: That Lady of events, though still she rave, Scarce can her course to mocke my minde advance, For (if not trusted first) none can deceive, And I attend no certainty from chance; Then I have learn'd to moderate my minde, Still with contentment crowning my desires. My garments course, my food such as I finde: âHe hath enough, who to no more aspires. VVhat satisfaction doth o're-flow my soule, (The world all weigh'd) while high accounts I cast, And in my memories unblotted scroule, Doe match the present time with others past? Those worldly mindes, whose weaknesse wealth doth cloake, (Though others happy) I them wretched thinke, For, whil'st that passions base all reason choake, The bodies slaves, their soules surcharg'd, doe sinke; Yet loath I not the world as loath'd by it, Like those who when disdain'd, pretend disdaine; No, no, I had (as Athens must admit) What riches, birth, or reputation gaine. And if that I would vaunt of mine own deeds, Faire Citie, where mine eyes first suck't the light, I challenge might what most thy glory breeds, For fame or power, as due to me of right: When Salamina had our yoke remov'd, With follies garments, wisedome to disguise, What none durst else attempt, I boldly mov'd, And seem'd a foole to make the people wise. Then having thus by policy prevail'd, My Countries squadrons leading to the field, Whil'st both by strength and stratagems assail'd, I forc'd that Ile (though wall'd with waves) to yeeld; But when renown'd, by that advent'rous deed, And turn'd victorious, charg'd with strangers spoiles, â(No perfect blisse below) worse did succeed, The peace that was abroad, bred civill broyles; âWhat with more violence doth fury leade, âThen mut'nous commons when they want a head? The meaner sort could not their mindes conforme, Those things to doe which great men did command: And (whil'st distracted with a dangerous storme,) All joyn'd to place the Rudder in my hand; I re-united that divided state, And with good successe manag'd matters well, Which further kindled, had been quench'd too late, That Hydra-headed tumult did so swell. VVhen I my worth by those two works had prov'd, And trod the path of power (as Prince) a space, The peoples Minion, by the Nobles lov'd, None could be great, save such as I would grace. Thus carried with the force of fortunes streame, I absolutely acted what I would; For, the democracy was but a name, The Cities raines my hand in trust did hold; I might (a tyrant) still have rul'd in state, But my cleare minde could no such clouds conceive, But gladly left what others urge of late, âIf I may rule my selfe, no more I crave; Yet some whose thoughts but for fraile glory car'd, Said that my sprite could not aspire to raigne, And that my errour could not be repair'd, Since so to erre meanes come not oft againe. My soule in this a more contentment findes, Then if a Diadem adorn'd my brow, I chayn'd th'affections of undaunted mindes, (Though barbarous earst) which did to order bow, Yet hardly could rich Citizens advise To keep the statutes which my lawes contain'd, Whil'st what one prais'd, another did despise: Some lov'd, some loath'd, ev'n as they thought they gain'd. At last, at least in shew, all rest content, Ev'n those who hate me most, lend their applause: âA worthy minde needs never to repent, âThe suffering crosses for an honest cause. Whil'st travelling now with a contented minde, The memory of this my fancy feeds, Though to great states their periods are assign'd: âTime cannot make a prey of Vertues deeds. Where seven-mouth'd Nile from a concealed source, Inunding ov'r the fields, no bankes can binde, I saw their wonders, heard their wise discourse; Rare sights enrich'd mine eyes, rare lights my minde. And if it were but this, yet this delights: Behold how CrÅsus here the Lydian King, To be his guest me earnestly invites, The which to some would great contentment bring; But I bemoane that world-bewitched man, Who makes his gold his god, the earth his heaven; And I will try by all the meanes I can, To make his judgement with his fortune caven. Chorus. VVhat can mans wandring thoughts confine, Or satisfie his fancies all? For whil'st he wonders doth designe, Even great things then doe seeme but small; What terrour can his sprite appall, Whil'st taking more then it can hold, He to himselfe contentment doth assigne; His minde which monsters breeds, Imagination feeds, And with high thoughts quite headlongs rold, Whil'st seeking here a perfect ease to finde, Would but melt mountains, and embrace the winde. What wonder though the soule of man, (A sparke of heaven that shines below) Doth labour by all meanes it can, Like to it selfe, it selfe to show? The heavenly essence, heaven would know, But from this masse, (where bound) till free, With paine both spend lifes little span; The better part would be above: And th'earth from th'earth cannot remove; How can two contraries agree? âThus as the best part or the worst doth move, âMan of much worth, or of no worth doth prove. O! from what fountaine doe proceed These humours of so many kindes? Each braine doth divers fancies breed, âAs many men, as many mindes: And in the world a man scarce findes Another of his humour right, Nor are there two so like indeed, If we remarke their severall graces, And lineaments of both their faces, That can abide the proofe of sight? âIf th'outward formes then differ as they doe, âOf force th'affections must be different too. âAh! passions spoile our better part, The soule is vext with their dissentions; We make a God of our owne heart, And worship all our vaine inventions; This braine-bred mist of apprehensions The minde doth with confusion fill; Whil'st reason in exile doth smart, And few are free from this infection, For all are slaves to some affection, Which doth oppresse the judgement still: âThose partiall tyrants, not directed right, âEven of the clearest mindes, eclipse the light. A thousand times, O happy he! Who doth his passions so subdue, That he may with cleare reasons eye, Their imperfections fountaines view, That so he may himselfe renew, Who to his thoughts prescribing lawes, Might set his soule from bondage free, And never from bright reason swerve, But making passions it to serve, Would weigh each thing as there were cause: O greater were that Monarch of the minde! Then if he might command from Thule to Inde.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 2. Scene 1. CrÅsus, Ãsope, Solon. What Prince hath been so fav?ur'd by the fates, As could like me of full contentment boast? Lov'd of mine own, and fear'd of forrain states, My foes have faln, my friends were never crost; For having that (which thousands seek, at will) My happinesse in all things hath been such, Heavens favorite, and fortunes Minion still, I know not what to wish, I have so much; Mine eyes no way did ever grieve my heart With any object that their sight did draw; My name applauded is in every part, My word an Oracle, my will a law: What brest can well confine this floud of joyes? Whose swelling current doth o'reflow my minde, VVhich never dream'd that which the soule annoyes, But did in all a satisfaction finde; I scorne vaine shadowes of conceited feares, As one whose state is built on marble grounds: In all my horoscope no cloud appeares, My blisse abounds, my pleasures passe all bounds. Ãsope. That Grecian (Sir) is at the Court arriv'd, VVhose wisedome fame through all the world records. CrÅ. And to extoll my state, have you not striv'd, VVhil'st bent to sooth his eares with courteous words? Ãsope. In all the parts where he hath chanc'd to be, In forrain bounds, or where he first saw light, He never did such stately wonders see, As since this Court enriched hath his sight; VVhen regall shewes had ravish'd first his eye, As mountains nurslings, little simple swaines, VVho us'd with infant flouds them never spy Sport, portative (like Serpents) through the Plaines, When one of them first comes to view the vailes, And wanton water-Nymphs there (wondring) sees, The rarenesse of the sight so much prevailes, That rillets rivers seeme, the rivers Seas: So all the guards that garnisht Solons way, Did to his minde a great amazement bring, The gallants (golden statues) made him stay; Each Groome a Prince, each Esquire seem'd a King, And now he comes to gaine your long'd-for sight; Whom in his minde no doubt he doth adore, He gaz'd on those who held of you their light, Sunne of this soile, he must admire you more; Now he o're all will spread your praises forth, A famous witnesse of your glorious raigne: âThe record of one wise man is more worth, âThen what a world of others would maintaine. Solon. Great Prince, doe not the loving zeale reject, VVhich a meane man, yet a good minde affords: And who perchance doth more your good affect, Then those who paint their love with fairer words. CrÅ. Thy love (sage Grecian) gratefull is to us, Whom fame long since acquainted with thy worth, So that we long long'd for thy presence thus, To spy the Spring which sent such treasures forth; Would God that many such would here resort, Whose vertues beames would shine in every brest, VVhose count'nance grave, would grace so great a Court, And like a Lampe give light unto the rest. Solon. Spare (courteous King) that undeserved praise, I am but one who doe the world despise, And would my thoughts to some perfection raise, A wisedome-lover, willing to be wise: Yet all that I have learn'd (huge toyles now past) By long experience, and in famous Schooles, Is but to know my ignorance at last; âWho think themselves most wise, are greatest fooles. CrÅ. âThis is the nature of a noble minde, âIt rather would be good, then be so thought, âAs if it had no ayme, but fame to finde, âSuch as the shadow, not the substance sought: Yet forc'd to give that which thou wilt not take: The world, what thou hold'st down, doth raise more high, That which thy face thus shunnes, shines on thy back: âPraise followes them, who what they merit flye: And now I thinke, on th'earth no creature lives, Who better can instruct what I would learne, Then thou to whom franke Nature largely gives A minde to see, a judgement to discerne. Solon. To satisfie your suit, my dutious care Shall it, or then my ignorance disclose. CrÅ. Loe, you have seene my pomp, my treasures rare, And all the strength on which my thoughts repose. âSolon. Those be but dreams of blisse which fortune brings, âTo breake (by bending) foolish mortalls mindes, âI saw but sencelesse heapes of melting things; âA waving wealth, expos'd to many windes: âThis but the body serving to decore, âAs foolish owners it, it th' owners spends, âWhere mindes more circumspect seek better store âOf wealth from danger free that never ends. CrÅ. I wot not what you meane, whil'st thus in love, With fain'd Ideas of imagin'd blisse; By fancies drawn, such portraits doe but move Sicke braines to dreame, that which indeed they misse; But more I have then their conceits can show, Whose rich conjectures breed but poore effects, And (I beseech you) did you ever know A man more blest then I in all respects? Solon. I, Tellus knew, a man whom Athens lov'd, Who to doe good, at no occasion fail'd, And in my judgement hath most happy prov'd, Since while he liv'd, belov'd, whil'st dead, bewail'd; And last (that he might reape all fruits of blisse) His Countries beaten bands, neere put to flight, By him encourag'd, scorn'd to be submisse, Who dy'd victorious in two Armies sight; More glorious now then when he was alive, As he in heaven, on earth his happy rest, To trace his steps, who led by Vertue strive, Heires of his worth, and honour'd by the best. CrÅ. Since this first place a private person gaines, Whose fortunes treasure in short time was told, Now next in ranke, who registred remaines, Whose happinesse you most accomplish'd hold? Solon. Of Cleobis, and Bitons vertuous way, The prosp'rous course doth to my thoughts approch: Their mother wanting on a solemne day, The horses which were us'd to draw her Coach, Them to supply the place, love kindely rais'd, Who drew her to that place of publike mirth, Whil'st both of them abundantly were prais'd, They for their piety, she for her birth: This charitable worke, when brought to end, Both dy'd, whil'st offering incense to the Gods. Who (favour'd so) to draw them did intend, From further danger of afflictions rods: O happy mother! who (with true delight) Of labours past such pleasant fruits enjoy'd, And happy children! who did thus acquite The mothers paine, and dyed whil'st well imploy'd. âAh, ah, our lives are fraile, doe what we can, âAnd like the brittle glasse, breake whil'st they glance, âThen oft the heavens to curbe the pride of man, âDoe inter-sowre our sweets with some sad chance. CrÅ. Is there no place appointed then for me? Or is my state so abject in thine eyes, That thou do'st thinke me blest in no degree, As one, whose best in fortunes ballance lyes? Or think'st thou me (of judgement too remisse) A wretch expos'd to want, to scorne, or paines, The bastard childe of fortune, barr'd from blisse, VVhom heavens doe hate, and all the world disdaines? Are those poore creatures then to be compar'd, With one who may consume such in his wrath? Who (as I please) doe punish or reward, Whose words, nay ev'n whose lookes give life or death. Solon. Let not your judgement thus from reason shrinke, To glose on that which simply comes from me; âThey who doe freely speake, no treason thinke, âOne cannot both your friend and flatterer be. To us who Grecians are, the Gods doe grant A moderate measure of an humble wit, So that our Country yet did never want Some whom the world for wise men did admit. And yet amongst us all the greatest number (Whil'st living) looke not for a perfect rest, Though Fortunes minions in her bosome slumber, And seeme to some, whom this world blindes, most blest: Yet ov'r all mortall states, change so prevailes, We alterations daily doe attend, And hold this for a ground that never failes, âNone can be throughly blest before the end: âI may compare our state to table-playes, âWhil'st Iudges that are blinde, give onely light; âTheir many doubt the earnest minde dismayes, âWhich must have happy throwes, then use them right: âSo all our dayes in doubt, what things may chance, âTime posts away, our breath seems it to chace, âAnd when th'occasion comes us to advance, âIt of a thousand, one can scarce embrace. When by a generous indignation mov'd, Two fight with danger, for a doubtfull praise; Whil'st valour blindely, but by chance is prov'd, That ones disgrace, anothers fame must raise: O! what a foole his judgement will commit, To grace the one, with a not gain'd applause? Where fortune is but to give sentence yet, Whil'st bloudy agents plead a doubtfull cause: âThis world a field is, whereas each man fights, âAnd arm'd with reason, resolutely goes âTo warre, (till death close up the bodies lights) âBoth with externall, and internall foes; âAnd how can he the Victors title gaine, âWho yet is busied with a doubtfull fight? âOr he be happy who doth still remaine In fortunes danger for a small delight? âThe wind-wing'd course of man, away fast weares, âCourse that consists of houres, houres of a day, âDay that gives place to night, night full of feares: âThus every thing doth change, all things decay: âThose who doe stand in peace, may fall in strife, âAnd have their fame by infamy supprest: âThe evening crownes the day, the death the life; âMany are fortunate, but few are blest. CrÅ. I see this Grecians sprite but base appeares, Which cannot comprehend heroicke things: The world of him more then he merits heares, At least he knowes not what belongs to Kings: Yet fame his name so gloriously array'd, That long I long'd to have him in my house; But all my expectations are betray'd, I thinke a Mountaine hath brought forth a Mouse. Scene 2. Solon, Ãsope. This King hath put his trust in trustlesse toyes, Whil'st courting onely temporary things, And like a hooded Hawk, gorg'd with vaine joyes At randon flyes, born forth on follys wings: O how this makes my griefe exceeding great, To see ones care, who lives for dead things such, Whil'st shew-transported mindes admire his state: Which I not envy, no, but pitty much. âThus wormes of th'earth (whil'st low-plac'd thoughts prevaile) âLove melting things, whose shew the body fits, âWhere soules of clearer sight doe never faile, âTo value most the treasure of good wits. âThose worldly things doe in this world decay, âOr at the least we leave them with our breath, âWhere to eternity this leades the way, âSo differ they as farre as life and death. Ãsope. And yet what wonder though he wander thus, Whom still by successe treacherous fortune blindes? Though this indeed seem somewhat strange to us, Who have with learning purifi'd our mindes; Was he not borne heire of a mighty state? And us'd with fortunes smiles, not fear'd for frownes, Doth measure all things by his owne conceit? A great defect, which fatall is to Crownes; Then from his youth still trusting in a Throne, With all that pride could crave, or wealth could give, Vs'd with entreaties, and contrould by none, He would the tongue of liberty deprive; Though to his sight I dare not thus appeare, Whose partiall judgement, farre from reason parts; I grieve to see your entertainment here So farre inferiour to your owne deserts; That matchlesse wisedome which the world admires, And (ravish't with delight,) amazed heares, Since not in consort with his vaine desires, Did seeme impleasant to distemper'd eares: Eares which can entry give to no discourse, Save that which enters fraughted with his praise, He can love none but them that love his course, And thinkes all fooles who use no flattering phrase: This with the great ones doth the gods displease, Though spreading all her heavenly treasures forth, They (if not in their livery them to please) Doe vertue vilifie, as of no worth. Solon. I care not, Ãsope, how the King conceiv'd Those my franke words which I must alwaies use; I came not here till he my comming crav'd, And now when come, will not my name abuse; Should I his poys'nous Sycophants resemble, Whose silken words their Soveraigne doe o'rethrow? I for his Diadem would not dissemble, âWhat hearts doe thinke, the tongues were made to show. And what if I, his humour to content, The worlds opinion lost by gaining ones? He can but give me gifts which may be spent, But nought can cleere my fame if darkned once; That so he might my reputation raise, If I sooth'd him, it would procure my shame; âWhil'st those who vitious are, our vertues praise, âThis in effect is but a secret blame. âThough as a simple man he me despise, âYet better simply good, then doubly ill; âI not my worth by others praises prize, âNor by opinions doe direct my will. That praise contents me more which one imparts, Of judgement sound, (though of a meane degree) Then praise from Princes voyd of princely parts, Who have more wealth, but not more wit then he. Ãsope. Who come to Court, must with Kings faults comport. Solon. Who come to Court, should truth to Kings report. Ãsope. A wise man at their imperfections winkes. Solon. An honest man will tell them what he thinkes. Ãsope. So should you lose your selfe, and them not save. Solon. But for their folly, I no blame would have. Ãsope. By this you should their indignation finde. Solon. Yet have the warrant of a worthy minde. Ãsope. It would be long ere you were thus preferr'd. Solon. Then it should be the King, (not I) that err'd. Ãsope. They guerdon as they love, they love by guesse. Solon. Yet when I merit well, I care the lesse. Ãsope. It's good to be still by the Prince approv'd. Solon. It's better to be upright, though not lov'd. Ãsope. But by this meane, all hope of honour failes. Solon. Yet honesty in end ever prevailes. Ãsope. I thinke they should excell (for vertue rare) All men in wit, who unto men give lawes; Kings of their kingdomes, as the centers are, To which each weighty thing by nature drawes: For as the mighty rivers, little streames, And all the liquid pow'rs which rise or fall, Doe seeke in sundry parts by severall seames, The Oceans bosome that receives them all. It as a Steward of the tumid deeps Doth send them backe by many secret veynes, And (as the earth hath need of moisture) keepe These humid treasures to refresh the Plaines. Thus are Kings brests the depths where daily flow Cleare streames of knowledge with rare treasures charg'd, So that continually their wisedomes grow, By many helpes, which others want, enlarg'd: For those who have intelligence ov'r all, Doe commonly communicate to Kings, All th'accidents of weight that chance to fall; Which great advantage, Greatnesse to them brings. They (jealously dispos'd) comment on mindes, And these who Arts, or Natures gifts enhaunce, (Whose value no where else a Merchant findes) Doe come to Kings, as who may them advance. No doubt great Iove, since they supply his place, (So with their charge to make their vertues even) Doth give to them some supernaturall grace, Vice-gods on th'earth, great Lievtenants of heaven. Solon. As you have shown, Kings good occasion have To sound the deepes and mysteries of wit, And those who so their states from ruine save, Doe well deserve upon a Throne to sit, But ah those rivers are not ever pure, Through tainted channels which oft times convaid, By flatteries poyson rendred are impure; âOft Princes hearts are by their eares betray'd: For impudent effronted persons dare Court with vaine words, and detestable lyes, Whil'st men of minds more pure must stand afarre, âThe light is loathsome to diseased eyes. But with amazement this transports my minde, Some who are wise grosse flattery can digest, And though they know how all men are inclin'd, Yet please the bad, and do but praise the best. Is't that such men no errour can controll, Nor will not crosse their appetite in ought, But (nothing censuring) every thing extoll, Where better wits would argue as they thought; Or since the world of worth in all esteemes, They never like a pregnant sprite to raise, So to have none who but to help them seemes, Or may pretend an int'rest in their praise: This self-conceit is a most dangerous shelfe, Where many have made shipwrack unawares, âHe who doth trust too much unto himselfe, âCan never faile to fall in many snares. âOf all men else great Monarchs have most need âTo square their actions, and to weigh their words, âAnd with advice in all things to proceed; âA faithfull Counsell oft great good affords. âLoe, how th'inferiour spheares of force do bend âAs the first mover doth their courses drive, âThe Commons customes on the Prince depend, âHis manners are the rules by which they live; âAs for himselfe none onely is brought forth, âKings for the use of many are ordain'd, âThey should like Sunnes cleare Kingdomes with their worth, âWhose life a patterne must be kept unstain'd: âAll vertuous Princes have a spatious field âTo shew their worth, though even in Fortunes spight, âWhere meane men must to their misfortune yeeld, âWhil'st want of power doth cloud their vertue quite; âAs pretious stones are th'ornaments of rings, âThe stone decores the ring, the ring the hand, âSo Countries are conforme unto their Kings, âThe King decores the Court, the Court the Land; âAnd as a drop of poyson spent alone, âInfected fountains doth with venome fill, âSo mighty states may tainted be by one: âA vitious Prince is a contagious ill. Ãsope. It easie is anothers faults to spie, And paint in th'aire the shadows of our mindes, Whil'st apprehending with the inward eye A high perfection which no practise findes. Solon. I grant, those grounds which we imagine may, Will move no charmed man, much lesse a Prince, To disenchant himselfe, and seeke some way At Reasons Court, his passions to convince; Ere CrÅsus can refraine from this his fury, He must forsake himselfe (as one renew'd) And in the lethe of oblivion burie The vanities that have his soule subdew'd; Those his prerogatives he first must bound, And be a man, a man to be controll'd, Then all his faults (as in another found) An arbiter with equall eyes behold; Could he cast off this vaile of fond self-love, Through which each object Pride too grosly spies, He would these ravenous Parasites remove, Vile instruments of shame that live by lyes; The onely meanes to make such people part, That he might judge more freely of his state, Were to cast out the Idoll of his heart, Which (when o're-thrown) he must disclaime too late: For, forraine flatterers could finde no accesse, If not that weighing his owne worth too much, He first concludes (to sooth himselfe inclin'd) That all their praises should of right be such; And when those hireling Sycophants have found A Prince whom too secure opinion makes, His noblest part they by smooth weapons wound, âAll spoyle by pleasing them whom flattery takes: Ore rulers, rule when such a person beares, Of vertuous men the rising to prevent, From wholsome counsell they close up his eares To crosse the better sort in all things bent. Ãsope. If you at Court to credit would arise, You must not seek by truth to gaine renowne, But sometime must applaud what you despise, And smile in show whil'st in effect you frowne. Solon. From hence in haste I will my selfe retyre, I hate Courts slavery, it my freenesse scornes, Nor am I one whom CrÅsus doth desire, Since I detest what him (he thinks) adornes; O how light Fortune doth his folly flout, While as he glories in this flying show! With greedy harpies hedg'd in round about, Which gape to be made rich by his o're-throw. Not all the wealth that his great kingdome shows, Can make me from my resolution shrinke; Nor can the terrour of a Tyrants blows Enforce my tongue to speake more then I thinke; Nothing so much as doubts doth vex the minde, Whil'st anxious thoughts to fix no where can come, Yet every one the way to rest may finde, A resolution all things doth o're-come. âAnd since my thoughts in Innocency rest, âNo outward warre can inward peace surprise, âWhat can imagin'd be to brave a brest, âThat both doth death, and povertie despise? Exeunt. Chorus. Of all the Creatures bred below, We must call Man most miserable, Who all his time is never able To purchase any true repose; His very birth may well disclose What miseries his blisse o're-throw: For, first (when borne) he cannot know, Who to his state is friend or foe, Nor how at first he may stand stable, But even with cryes, and teares, doth show What dangers do his life enclose; Whose griefes are sure, whose joyes a fable; Thus still his dayes in dolour so He to huge perils must expose; And with vexation lives, and dyes with woe, Not knowing whence he came, nor where to go. Then whil'st he holds this lowest place, O! how uncertaine is his state? The subject of a constant fate, To figure forth inconstancy, Which ever changing as we see, Is still a stranger unto peace: âFor if man prosper but a space, âWith each good successe fondly bold, âAnd puft up in his owne conceit, âHe but abuses Fortunes grace; âAnd when that with adversity âHis pleasures treasures end their date, âAnd with disasters are controll'd, âStraight he begins for griefe to dye: âAnd still the top of some extreame doth hold, âNot suffering Summers heat, nor Winters cold. âHis state doth in most danger stand, âWho most abounds in worldly things, âAnd soares too high with Fortunes wings, âWhich carry up aspiring mindes, âTo be the object of all windes; The course of such when rightly scan'd, (Whil'st they cannot themselves command) Transported with an empty name, Oft unexpected ruine brings; There were examples in this Land, How worldly blisse the senses blindes, From which at last oft trouble springs, He who presumes upon the same, Hidde poyson in his pleasure findes; And sayling rashly with the windes of fame, Doth oft times sinke downe in a Sea of shame. It may be fear'd our King at last, Whil'st he for nothing is afraid, Be by prosperity betray'd: For, growing thus in greatnesse still, And having worldly things at will, He thinks though time should all things waste, Yet his estate shall ever last The wonder of this peopled round; And in his own conceit hath said: No course of heaven his state can cast, Nor make his fortune to be ill; But if the gods a way have lay'd That he must come to be uncrown'd, What sudden feares his minde may fill, And in an instant utterly confound The state which stands upon so slippery ground? When such a Monarchs minde is bent To follow most the most unwise, Who can their folly well disguise With sugred speeches, poisnous baits? The secret canker of great States, From which at first few disassent, The which at last all do repent, Then whil'st they must to ruine go; When Kings begin thus to despise Of honest men the good intent; Who to assure their Soveraignes seats, Would faine in time some help devise, And would cut off all cause of woe, Yet cannot second their conceits: These dreadfull Comets commonly fore-go A Kings destruction, when miscarried so.</field>

Huge cares (suggesting harme) my joyes controul, Whose minde some comming crosse charactred beares; And credulous suspition (too too wise) To fortifie my feares doth meanes invent; Whil'st sudden trouble doth my sprite surprise, A presage sad which boasts some bad event; âI thinke the soule (since an immortall brood) âHath by inheritance an heavenly power, âWhich some fore-knowledge gives of ill, and good, âBut not the meanes to scape a fatall houre; âThough with this mortall vaile, when made halfe blinde, âNot well fore-seeing what each time forth brings, âYet it communicates unto the minde âIn cloudy dreames true (though mysterious) things; âImagination wonderfull in force, âThe judgement oft foiles with confusion so, âThat (then they prove things presupposed worse) âEre time distress'd, man multiplies his woe: âFor as the shadow seemes more monstrous still, âThen doth the substance whence the shape it takes; âSo the conjecture of a threatned ill, âMore then it selfe some to be troubled makes; This alteration too seemes more then strange, Which suddenly so moved hath my minde. I see (more then I thought) all states may change, âWhen heaven pursues, th'earth no defence can finde; My soule all pleasure is already loathing, This hath indeed so deep impression left, A dreame, a fancy, froth, a shadow, nothing Hath all my mirth even in a moment reft. Adrast. Whence (mighty Soveraigne) can this change proceed, Which doth obscure the rayes of Princely grace? Those who are school'd in woe, may clearly reade A mighty passion written in your face; And (if a stranger may presume so farre) What friend is false, or who are fear'd as foes? For I imagine in what state you are: A secret sympathie imparting woes; Two strings in divers Lutes set in accord, (Some say) th'one onely touch'd both give a sound; Even so souls tun'd to griefe, the like afford, Whose airie motions mutually do wound. âCrÅ. No doubt, it must disburden much the minde, âA Secretary in distresse to have; âWho by his owne, anothers griefe can finde, âWhere glad mindes scorne what they cannot conceive: And I (Adrastus) would the cause declare, With which I so torment my soule in vaine, But yet I blush to tell my foolish care: The fond illusion of a drowsie braine. Adrast. As bodies temper'd are, or souls inclin'd, All dreames by night th'imagination makes, Or else th'impression thoughts worke in the minde, By which (when wakening) one most travell takes. CrÅ. By sleepe arrested as o're-come by death, In Natures bosome I imbrac'd true rest, And in that Masse where nothing mov'd but breath, Lifes faculties sleep for a time supprest; Then whil'st the sprite most pow'rfull did remaine, Since least distress'd by this terrestriall part. Adrast. Souls at such times their strength so strongly straine, That oft their burdens as astonish'd start. CrÅ. To rarifie the aire from vapours pow'rs, When first Aurora rose from Tithons bed, Ere PhÅbus blushing stole from Thetis bowres, This apprehension in my braine was bred: I onely have two sonnes, and th'one (you see) The signe of Natures indignation beares, And from his birth-day dumbe is dead to me, Since he can give no comfort to mine cares; The other Atis (all my lifes delight) In whom the treasures of my soule are kept, I thought (vaine be my thought) in the twi-light, (I know not whether yet I wak't or slep't) Whil'st he was sporting, void of worldly cares, And not in danger, which could threaten death, A pointed toole of iron fell unawares; And from his body banish did his breath; Whil'st the pale carkase did upbraid mine eyes, The horrour of the sight my sense re-call'd, Which when I thinke of, yet my courage dyes, Such an exceeding feare my sprite appall'd; This touch'd my state so much, it hath me mov'd To match my Sonne in marriage at this time With vertuous CÅlia, whom he dearely lov'd, That both might reape the pleasure of their prime; And if the heavens his o're-throw have decreed By destiny which cannot be revok'd, So may we have behinde some of his seed, Ere in his blossome all our hopes be choak'd; Thus, ere his soule lodge in the lightlesse shade, Some of his off-spring may content my minde, âI cannot hold him altogether dead, âWho leaves his Image in some one behinde; And though we do what ever seemes the best To disappoint those but surmiz'd annoyes, Yet for all this my minde hath never rest, Some secret terrour doth disturbe my joyes. Adrast. Ah (Sir) if such a dreamed ill as this, Hath plung'd your soule even in the depths of griefe, Unhappie I, who waile a thing that is, Whil'st hope (though rack'd) dare promise no reliefe; Though all those dreadfull fancies took effect, (Which heavy chance th'almighty Iove with-hold) None can compare them, no, in no respect With those mis-fortunes which my state enfold: For though your Sonne dye by anothers hand, You shall but waile his death, and not your crime; The heavens of me my brothers bloud demand, His fate, my fault, mourne must I all my time. CrÅ. In what strange forme could this disaster fall, From which there flow salt flouds of just distresse? Tell on at length the fatall cause of all, âA greater griefe makes one forget the lesse. Adrast. My sorrows ground I smother'd still till now, As too offensive food for dainty eares, But since of such discourse you do allow, Ile tell a tale that may move stones to teares; Of Phrygian Princes my great Father come, Had in my growing age a tender care, That all my education might become One whom he might for mighty hopes prepare; As yet foure lustres scarcely had begun To grace my witness'd sex with blooming cheeks, When I (fond youth) that lab'rinth could not shunne, Whence backe in vaine the straying Entrer seeks. I lov'd, O fatall love, unlovely fate! The vertuously faire, yet fairest Dame That ever was enshrin'd in soules conceit, Or ditties gave to grace the sounds of fame; Straight were my fancies to her beauties ty'd, âNone can paint passions, but in feeling mindes, I burn'd, freez'd, doubted, hop'd, despair'd, liv'd, dy'd, With actions chang'd as oft as Autumnes windes; Yet many conflicts past 'twixt hopes and feares, To feast, at least to nurce my starv'd desires; She granted had a truce unto my teares, And temper did with equall flames my fires: For as she was the most esteemed Saint, Whose image Love erected in my minde, So when her eares had harbour'd once my plaint, It pitie first, and then did favour finde, But ah triumphing in mine owne conceit As one whose love his Lady did preferre, I was corrivall'd (O disastrous fate!) By one who lov'd, but was not lov'd by her, He looking as I look'd, saw what I saw, Saw Natures wonder, and the worlds delight, And straight as that blinde god (blinde guide) did draw, Still (like a Lizard) liv'd upon her sight. Then labour'd he that Iewell straight to wonne, Whose matchlesse worth he priz'd above his breath, And loath'd all light which flow'd not from that Sunne, As life without her had beene worse then death; Yea, Fortune seem'd to favour his desire, And where to build high hopes did give him ground. The Nymph her parents daily did require, That she might furnish physick for his wounds; Of my distracted thoughts strange was the strife, Who threatned thus with eminent mishap, Was like to lose a thing more deare then life, Whil'st others striv'd my treasure to entrap; The man who sought my joyes to undermine, I could not justly wish his state o're-throwne, Nor blame the sprite that sympathiz'd with mine; I envi'd not his lot, but wail'd mine owne. Now in my breast a mighty rage did raigne, Which forc'd my soule with inward wounds to bleed, Some fancies fear'd what once his love might gaine, Since it was possible that he might speed, Then others call'd her constancy to minde, Which would not yeeld by such assaults though prov'd, Yet forc'd to feare the frailty of her kinde, âA hearing woman may in time be mov'd; Thus toss'd with doubts amidst a deep of woe, Which with suspition did my joyes supplant, I blam'd the thoughts that durst accuse her so, As vertues patterne could one vertue want; And, nor I hop'd, his toils no further wrought, â(Affliction oft affection doth enflame) She of her sex who was the wonder thought, Would thus not wrong the glory of her name, Though in my absence they had oft assai'd, That from her minde they might have me remov'd, (The Sunne burns hotest when his beames are stay'd) The more they cross'd her love, the more she lov'd; For finding that delay no end affords, And how faire Generals onely flow'd from Art, She did upbraid him with disdainefull words, To raze those hopes that had abus'd his heart; âLove is a joy which upon paine depends, âA drop of sweet, drown'd in a sea of sowres; âWhat folly doth begin, oft fury ends, âThey hate for ever, who have lov'd for houres: When all his arguments prov'd of no force, Straight with disdaine his soule in secret burn'd, And what he thought was ill, to make farre worse, That Apostate to furie favour turn'd; Through love preposterous procreating hate, His thoughts amongst themselves could not agree, Whil'st what was best he deeply did debate, To see her dead, or then enjoy'd by me: What (said he) when he first had mus'd a space, (So hard it is to quench affections fires) Shall I disfigure that Angelike face, And cloud those beauties which the world admires? Shall she by me be to confusion brought, To whom I vows, and prayers did impart? To whom I sacrifiz'd each secret thought, And on her beauties altar burn'd my heart? Or shall I see her in anothers pow'r, And in his bosome laid, upbraid my losse, Whil'st both with scornfull smiles; then death more sowre, To point me out for sport, report my crosse? That sight which sometime did me sweetly charme, Should it become a cause of griefe to me? No, none who lives shall glory in my harme, Since she will not be mine, she shall not be. The hatefull lover having vow'd her death, Did with a cup of poyson drowne my joyes; The fairest body from the sweetest breath Was parted thus (O ocean of annoyes!) That Monster Fame, whose many mouthes and eares Must know, but not conceale a rare thing long, And prodigall of ill, most chiefly beares The worst news first, inform'd me of this wrong: For neighbouring neare the most unhappy part, That had beene spoyl'd of such a noble guest, As death had hers, the furies seiz'd my heart, Whose paine did spring from that which bred her rest; How huge a weight did first confound my soule No tongue can tell; it still my minde torments, Rage did of griefe the outward signes controll: âWhen great windes blow the fire, the smoak worst vents; Whil'st generous furie did disguise my griefe, I ranne transported with a mighty rage, Bent (by revenge, or death to get reliefe) A tragicke actor for a bloudy stage: For I was come no sooner to the place, Whereas I thought the Murtherer to have found, But I did meet (O ruine and disgrace!) Too deare a friend to catch an enemies wound; Ah! passions dimn'd mine eyes, wrath led my hand, I was no more my selfe, Griefe had me kill'd; The first by Night, who did before me stand, (As one whose breast with rage Alecto fill'd) By chance encount'ring, ere he spake a word, I bath'd his bosome with a crimson floud, And in his breast did drowne the cruell sword, That in anothers body drank my bloud; But when a Torch had partly rob'd the night, Proud of suppos'd revenge (ah bitter gaine) I saw, I knew, black knowledge, cruell sight, My brother was the man, whom I had slaine; O bitter losse, which nothing can repaire! My soule with two such monstrous deeds annoy'd, Griefe, rage, spite, shame, amazement, and despaire, Gall'd, toss'd, burn'd, dash'd, astonish'd, and destroy'd; The thought of my offence doth grieve me most, Yet am I sometime by loves verdict cleans'd; And straight my brothers violated ghost, By dreadfull dreames doth bragge to be reveng'd. CrÅ. Now whil'st this great disaster did occurre, What had the author of your anguish done? Adrast. He having heard this lamentable stirre, Whom self-accusing thoughts convicted soone, Straight (wounded by a wonderfull remorse) Led by mad love, or desp'rate feare to death, He bent to follow her, or dreading worse, (Stab'd by himselfe) dy'd to defraud my wrath. CrÅ. Those strange mishaps your enemies eyes must weet, And force compassion from your greatest foe, Since many monstrous circumstances meet To make a horrid harmony in woe; âBut what doth touch ones selfe, most force doth finde, âFor ills when felt, then heard, griefe more abounds; This extasie hath so o're-whelm'd my minde, A melancholy huge all mirth confounds; âYet such disasters past, we must omit, âAt least no more immoderately lament, âAnd as for those which are but comming yet, Use ordinary meanes them to prevent. Adrast. No wonder (Sir) though by all means you strive, From dangerous actions Atis to restraine. CrÅ. I will unto his youth attendance give, Which in my age may guerdon'd be againe; If it be possible for mortall states To strive against the Starres, and be more strong; I Fortune must unarme, and crosse the fates, By barring both all meanes to do me wrong: I have commanded under paine of death, That no such weapon be within my walls, As I suppos'd extinguish might his breath, To scape a storme which oft by Fortune falls; He to frequent the fields must oft deferre; And without guards his lodging never leave; Loe where with Countrey-men he doth conferre, We will go try what they of him would have. Scene 2. Chorus of Countreymen, CrÅsus, Atis, Adrastus, CÅlia. Lend (Sir) a willing eare to humble words, Let not our basenesse barre us from your grace, Which still it selfe alike to all affords, Who blesse their sight with that Majesticke face; âFor simple subjects Monarchs must take care, âThough this our state be thought but abject now, âYou are our head, and we your members are, âAnd you must care for us, we care for you; âOur poverty to us is no reproach, âWhich innocent integrity adornes, âOn others states we never do encroach, âBut live by labours, prickt with many thornes; âAnd ever busied for the Countries good, âWe have no time to muse of vaine conceits, âBut (earning with continuall toile our food) âMust entertaine the pompe of prouder states; âAnd (Sir, though plaine) thinke not our meaning ill, âWho thus dare speake so freely as we do, âWhil'st Mediatours do dilate our will, âThey wrest it as they will, and spoile us too; âTo count'nance such as us, you need not shunne: âA great man too well grac'd may do more harme; âAnd it stains not the glory of the Sunne, âThough oft his beams an abject object warme. CrÅ. Be not discourag'd by your base estate, Ye are my people, and Ile heare your plaint, âA King must care for all, both small and great, âAnd to do good (like God) should never faint; âThe Scepter such as those should chiefly shroud, âNot Cotages, but Castles spoile the Land, âTo spare the humble, and to plague the proud, âA vertue is that doth make Kings to stand. Cho. Sir, our estate some hastie help requires: In Misia neare the celebrated rounds Of great Olympus which the world admires, There haunts a Boare the horrour of these bounds: His body bigge, and hideous is his forme, Whose foamie jaw with tusks like javelins strikes, And in deformity all parts conforme, His backe hath bristles like to iron pikes. This Natures Monster, wondred at by men, The forrests Tyrant, and the Countries terrour, Doth murder all, and draws them to his denne, Who chance to crosse his way by fatall errour; In teares whil'st melting, tender mothers waile, (The goared infants tumbling in their bloud;) This beast to be abhorr'd doth them assaile, And in his bowels buries both for food; Then when we flie the field where he doth haunt, To have his hunger, or his rage allay'd, He all our labours quickly doth supplant, And poore mens hopes are strangely thus betray'd; Ere this, of true repose we were the types, And pasturing on each plaine our fleecie flocks, Did make a consort of our warbling pypes With moving Crystals, playing on the rocks; And oft to ease our toils (all rang'd in bands) With garlands guarded from Apollo's beames, We gaz'd upon Pactolus golden sands, Glass'd, bath'd, and quench'd our thirst, with his pure streames; Whil'st we preferr'd, the river seem'd amaz'd, Even to his golden bed his grassie banke, And lay and look'd whereas our cattell graz'd, Farre from all envy of a greater ranke; That to represse oppression you take care, Though we were dumbe, the publick rest may speake: Your Laws, like Spiders webs are not a snare For little flyes, that them the bigge may breake; Meane men by them from great mens pride are sav'd, The heavens continue long your prosp'rous raigne, And let us not by such a beast be brav'd, Which by our ruine would your Scepter staine. CrÅ. What would you then that should be done by me, That may repay your losse, repaire this wrong? Cho. We crave none of your wealth, but wish to see This Boare be-bloud the staffe of the most strong: Let valorous Atis worthily your Sonne, With Lydian youth incapable of feares, Go to the fields before the rising Sunne, To quench his thirst have drunk the mornings teares, And we shall leade them crown'd with lawrell forth, Where in strict bounds, yet a theatre large For men to make a triall of their worth, They with advantage may this Monster charge; So shall we reape repose, and they delight, Whil'st that prodigious body justly smarts, Though fearfull once, then made a pleasant sight, When like a wood it planted is with darts. CrÅ. I may not spare my Sonne for a respect, Which is not needfull now to be made knowne, But others shall be sent for that effect, That this out-ragious beast may be o're-thrown; The stately gallants who attend our grace (That by the world their valour may be view'd) This enterprise will willingly embrace, And not returne, till with his blood imbru'd; I sweare, this monster shall when he is dead, A memorable monument remaine; In Phebes church men shall admire his head, As Pythons spoiles, when by her brother slaine. Atis. Ah! wherein Father did I thus offend? Or what vile signe of a degener'd minde Have you but mark'd in me, whose course may tend To the reproach of our imperiall kinde? An abiect dastard, who for nought availes, Whose worth the world must trust, but never trie! As one whose strength, or then his Courage failes. Must I in vile repose inglorious lie! Lie like a wanton by vaine thoughts bewitch'd! Who spoild of force, effeminately lives, A Peacok poore, with painted pennes enrich'd? Yet bare of every thing that glory gives; What glory give those titles unto me, Which by succession fall, not by desert? Should but my fame with borrow'd feathers flie? For, come of kings a kingdome is my part; âWho honour as hereditary claimes, âLike bastards base, doth but his birth-right blote, I scorne to beg my worth from dead mens names, Or to gaine credite onely by my Coate; What comfort's this to have the highest seate, And all the blisse that Majestie imparts, If those whom onely we exceed in State, Be our Superiours in farre better parts? âMore then a Crowne true worth should be esteem'd, âTh'one fortunes gift, the other is our own, âBy which the minde from anguish is redeem'd, When fortunes goods are by her selfe o'rethrown. CrÅ. I see what brave desires boile in thy soule, And make thee thus magnanimous to be, This high-bent courage nothing can controule, All Lydia is not large enough for thee: Goe, seeke an Empire equall with thy minde, Of which a Crowne is due to every thought; But Glories love whilst courting in this kinde, I feare by thine, our ruine may be wrought: And pardon me (deare Sonne) great is the love Which makes me watch so warily thy wayes; A Fathers care what kind of thing can move, Whom such a danger not in time dismayes? The Heaven of late advertis'd me by dreames, That some sad fortune threatned thee too soone, Each day some ominous signe attendance claimes, Which out of time are mark'd, when all is done: This was the cause that hastned us so much, To have thee bound to Hymens sacred law, This was the cause that all our care was such, Out of our sight all weapons to withdraw: Scorne not those Comets which amazement notes, âThe starres to mortall states a bounds designe, And doe not thinke t'is but my love that dotes, For if thou fall, my fate depends on thine. Atis. Would God I had some meanes once ere my death, To satisfie that infinite desert, Which I shall hold, so long as I have breath, Deepe registred with reverence in my heart; âYet (sir) we see this is a naturall thing, âThat too excessive loue engenders feares: A sport like this can no great perill bring, Where either all delights the eyes, or th'eares. If from my former deedes I now should shrinke, (As voide of vertue) to soft pleasure thrall, Of your two Sonnes what might your Subjects thinke, Th'one wanting but one sense, the other all? What fancies might my late spous'd love possesse, To see her husband hatefull in mens sights, And honours bounds thus basely to transgresse, As womaniz'd still wallowing in delights? âThough women would have men at their devotion, âThey hate base mindes that hatch no noble notion. CrÅ. Well, well, my Sonne, I see thou must prevaile: Goe, follow forth the chase, use thine owne for me, Yet stay, or let my words this much availe, Walke with more care to scape this threatned storme; Thy hawtie sprite to tempt all hazards bent, I feare transports thee to a fatall strife, I wish to erre, yet the event prevent, Lest that thy courage but betray thy life; And (deare Adrastus) I must let him know, What benefits I have bestow'd on thee, Not to upbraid thee, no, but so to show How I may trust thee best thus bound to mee; When thou from Phrygia cam'st defil'd with blood, And a fraternall violated love, When desp'rate quite thou as distracted stood, Fled from thy Fathers face; curst from above, Thou foundst me friendly, and my Court thy rest, A Sanctuary which thy life did save; And dangers scap't (when one hath beene distress'd) A wary wisdome by experience leave; Yet all that favour past, was but a signe Of generous greatenesse, which would gratious prove; But in thy hands my soule I'le now consigne, And give the greatest pledge that can binde love. Behold how Atis of our age the shield, Whose harme as you have heard, I fear'd ere now, Is for his pastime to goe range the field, And with his custodie I will trust you; I must (my friend) even fervently exhort, Waite on my Sonne, remember of my dreame. This dangerously delectable sport, Doth make mee feare the griefe exceeds the game. Adrast. I never shall those courtesies neglect: It grieves me not to thinke, nor heare the same, For whilst this sprite those members doth direct, All shall concurre to celebrate your fame; Yet were you pleas'd, I would not hence depart, Who doe all things that mirth may move abhorre, But with my passions here (retir'd a part) Woe past would waile, and shunne all cause of more; If to converse where not one crosse annoies, I feare my fellowship infect with woe, Those who themselves would recreate with Ioyes: Still strange mishaps attend me where I goe, But since you will commit this charge to mee, Your Majestie I'le studie to content, At least my faith shall from defects be free, And all my paines shall as you please be spent. Atis. Now bent to see this monsters ougly shape, With an inflam'd desire my thoughts doe burne, And Father feare not, dreame of no mishap, I hope with speed victorious to returne. CÅlia. Returne? from whence deare love? O deadly word. That doth import thy parting from my sight, I heard the name mishap, Ah! (my deare Lord) Should such strict limites bound so large delight? O cruell to thy selfe, unkinde to me! And can'st thou condescend to leave me soe? If (ere in doubt) abandon'd thus I be, It may deferre, but not defraud my woe; This might indeed to thee yeeld some reliefe, To have thy eares not wounded by my mone, But would wound me with a continuall griefe, To feare all things, where I should feare but one; Desist in time from this intended strife, A course too rash, and not approv'd by me, Remember I have int'rest in thy life, Which thus to venter I doe not agree; Hast thou not given a proofe in thy greene prime, That may content the most ambitious heapes? Whilst Atis was his own, then was it time To follow fancies unconfined Scopes; Thy selfe then onely camp'd in fortunes bounds, Thou do'st endanger CÅlia likewise now; You sigh her breath, she suffers in your wounds, You live in her, and she must die in you. Atis. Life of my soule, how doe such broken speaches, From troubled passions thus abruptly rise? I know (my love) thy love my minde o're-reaches: âAffection (Schoold with feares) is too too wise; I goe alongst the fields, for sport to range; Thy sighes doe but my soule with sorrow fill; And pardon (deare) I finde this wond'rous strange, That thou beginst now to resist my will; If I trespasse in ought against my dutie, Which makes thee thus my constancy mistrust; Mistrust not yet the Chains of thine own beauty, Which binde all my desires, and so they must; Are wee not now made one? such feares o'recome, Though I would flie, my selfe my selfe doe fetter, And if that I would flie, from whom? to whom? I can love none so well, none loves me better; Have pitty of those pearles, (sweet eyes, soules pleasures) Least they presage what thou would'st not have done; The Heavens had not given me those pretious treasures, Of such perfections to be spoil'd so soone. Chorus. Those who command above, High presidents of Heaven, By whom all things doe move, As they have order given, What worldling can arise, Against them to repine? Whilst castell'd in the skies, With providence divine; They force this peopled round, Their judgements to confesse, And in their wrath confound Proud mortalls who transgresse The bounds to them assign'd By Nature in their mind. Base brood of th'earth, vaine man, Why brag'st thou of thy might? The Heavens thy courses scan, Thou walk'st still in their sight; Ere thou wast borne, thy deedes Their registers dilate, And thinke that none exceedes The bounds ordain'd by fate; What Heavens would have thee to, âThough they thy Wayes abhorre, âThat thou of force must doe, âAnd thou canst doe no more: This reason would fulfill, Their worke should serve their will. Are we not heires of death, In whom there is no trust? Who toss'd with restlesse breath, Are but a dramme of dust; Yet fooles when as we erre, And heavens doe wrath contract, If they a space deferre Iust vengeance to exact, Pride in our bosome creepes, And misinformes us thus, That Iove in pleasure sleepes, Or takes no care of us: âThe eye of heaven beholdes, âWhat every heart enfoldes. The Gods digest no crime, Though they (delaying long) In the offenders time, Seeme to neglect a wrong, Till others of their Race, Fill up the cup of wrath, Whom Ruine and disgrace, Long time attended hath; And Gyges fault we feare, To CrÅsus charge be lay'd, Which Iove will not forbeare, Though it be long delay'd: âFor, O! sometimes the Gods âMust plague sinne with sharpe Rods. And loe how CrÅsus still, Tormented in his minde, Like to Reeds on a hill, Doth quake at every winde! Each step a terrour brings; Dreames doe by Night afflict him, And by day many things; All his Thoughts doe convict him; He his Starre would controule, This makes ill not the worst, Whilst he wounds his own soule, With apprehensions first: âMan may his fate foresee, âBut not shunne heavens decree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Scene 1. Adrastus, Croesus, Chorus. Can Heaven behold one stand to staine these times, Yet to the Stygian streames not headlong hurld? And can th'arth beare one burden'd with such crimes, As may provoke the wrath of all the world? Why sends not Iove, to have my course confin'd, A death-denouncing flash of rumbling Thunder? Else (roaring terrour) clouds of circling winde, By violence to teare me all a sunder? What corner yet unknowne from men remoov'd, Both burn'd with rage, and freezing in despayre, Shall I goe now possesse, to be approv'd, Where none but monsters like my selfe repaire? I'le goe indeede whom all the world detests, Who have no intrest in the fields of blisse, And barbarize amongst the brutish beasts, Where Tigers rage, Toades spue, and Serpents hisse: But though in some vast Zone, I finde a field, Where melancholy might a monarch be, Whilst silent deserts not one person yeeld To shrinke for horrour, when beholding me; Yet of my deeds which all the world doe tell, This cannot raze the still proclaimed Scroule, Since in my brest I beare about my hell, And cannot scape the terrours of my soule. Those fearfull Monsters of confus'd aspects, ChimÃ¦ra, Gorgon, Hydra, Pluto's Apes, Which in the world wrought wonderfull effects, And borrow'd from th'infernall shades their shapes, Their devillish formes which did the world amaze, Not halfe so monstrous as my selfe I finde, When on mine owne deformities I gaze, Amid'st blacke depths of a polluted minde; No, but my minde untainted still remaines, My thoughts in this delict have had no part, Which but by accident this foule fact staines, My hands had no commission from my heart; Yet, whether it was fortune, or my fate, Or some Hel-hag, that did direct my arme, The Lydians plague, I have undone this State, And am the instrument of all their harme: Then mountaines fall, and bruise me by your rounds, Your heights may hide me from the wrath of Heaven; But this not needes, since mee my fault confounds: With my offence no torment can be eaven. Ah! of what desert shall I now make choice, To flie the count'nance of an angry King? I know the venging sword of CrÅsus voice, To wound my soule, hostes of rebukes doth bring; The patterne of distresse, I'le stand alone, A memorable monster of mishap; For, though Pandora's plagues were all in one, All were too few, so vile a wretch to trap. Cho. O how the king is mov'd at Atis death! His face the portrait of a passion beares, With bended eyes, crost armes, and quivering breath, His Princely robe he desperately teares; Loe, with a silent pittie-pleading looke, Which shewes with sorrow mixt a high disdaine, He (whilst his soule seemes to dissolve in smoke) Straies twixt the corpes, and him who hath it slaine. CrÅ. Thou ruthlesse tyrant ruine of my blisse, And didst thou so disguise thy devillish nature, To recompence my curtesies with this? Ah cruell wretch, abominable creature! Thy Tigrish mind what wit could well detect, In mortall brests so great barbarity? What froward Sprite could but such spight suspect, In hospitality hostility? Did I revive thee when thy hopes were dead, When as thy life thy parents had not spar'd? And having heap'd such favours on thy head, Is this? Is this? Chor. He would say the reward. Adrast. I grant what you alledge and more is true; I have unto the height of hatred runne: A blood-stain'd wretch, who merit not to view The rolling Circles, nor the Rayie Sunne; No kind of art I purpose now to use, To colour this my crime, which might seeme lesse, Whilst painted with a pitifull excuse: No, it is worse then words can well expresse; Nor goe I thus to aggravate my crime, And damne my selfe to be absolv'd by others, No, no, such Rhetoricke comes out of time. I'le not survive his death, as earst my brothers. O! had that high disaster kill'd me straight, (As then indeed I di'd from all delight) I had not groan'd, charg'd with this inward weight, But slept with shadowes in eternall night: Yet must I die, at last (though late) growne wise, This in my mind most discontentment breedes, A thousand torturing deaths cannot suffice, To plague condignely for so haynous deeds. If that revenge th'Elysian Guests delights, The tombe of Atis shall exhaust my blood: No fitter offering for infernall sprites, Then one in whom they raign'd, while as he stood: The furies oft in me infus'd their Rage, And in my bosome did their Serpents place, Whose indignation labouring to asswage, Huge hellish horrours spoil'd my thoughts of peace. CrÅ. I find (poore wretch!) when I have search'd, and seene The fatall meanes which did inflict this wound, That not thy malice, but my fault hath beene, Of that which grieves us both the reall ground. âWhilst barely with a superficiall wit, âWee weigh the out-side of such strange events, âIf but the mediate meanes our judgements hit, âWe seeke not the first cause, that much contents: âBut when prodigious accidents fall out, âThough they amaze our mindes, and so they must, âThe cause of all comes from our selfe no doubt: âAh! man hath err'd; the Heavens are always Iust: In judgement now whilst entring with my soule, (Those partiall thoughts which flatterd me declin'd) Loe, marking of past wrongs the burd'nous scroule, Free from false colours, which did mocke my minde: O! then I see how heaven in plagues exceedes, Whilst vengeance due save ruine nought can end; Thus once the Gods must ballance worldlings deedes, Both what we did, and what we did intend? Sonne, Sonne, my faults procured have thy fall, For, guilty of thy blood, I gave the wound Which gave thee death, and whose remembrance shall My life each day with many deaths confound. Of Iove injust the Statutes I contemne, And if I were confronted with the Gods, Their providence (as partiall) would condemne, Who in such sorte doe exercise their rods. He thus now kill'd, with life to let me goe, May breed reproch to all the pow'rs divine: But ah! they knew no death could grieve me soe, As that, which through his heart was aim'd at mine; Now all the world those deities may despise, Which strike the guiltlesse, and the guilty spare; Cease haplesse man to plague thy selfe thus wise, I pardon thee, and pittie thy despaire. Adrast. O rigorous judgement! O outragious fate! Must I suruive the funeralls of my fame: All things which I behold, vpbraide my state, Too many monuments of one mans shame; All (and none more then I) my deeds detest, Yet some waile want of friends, and I of foes, To purge the world of such a dangerous pest, (Which still contagious) must taint hearts with woes; To wound this brest where all hells hosts do raigne, Seiz'd with just feare none dare a hand forth stretch, Else this base charge (as odious) doe disdaine, To deale with Death in favour of a wretch; Or must I yet (till more detested) stand, And fill the world with horrour of my name? What further mischiefe can require my hand? Must it ingrave on others graves my shame? Or would some bastard thought lifes cause debate, Which in the blasted field of comfort gleanes? No, no, in spite of Heaven I'le force my fate, âOne, when resolv'd to die, cannot want meanes: Proud Tyrant Death, and must thou make it strange, To wrap my wearied soule in further strife? Vnlesse my courage with my fortune change, (Though nothing else) I can command my life; But this (ay me!) all hope of helpe devowres; What gaines my soule by death in those sad times; If potent still in all her wonted pow'rs, Shee must remember of my odious crimes? What though un-bodied she the world forsake, Yet from her knowledge cannot be divorc'd? This will but vexe her at the shadowie lake, Till even to grone the God of Ghosts be forc'd, But welcome death, and would the Gods I had Lesse famous, or more fortunately liv'd; Then knowne if good, and kept obscure if bad; Of comfort quite I had not beene depriv'd; Ah! have I liv'd to see my Lady die? And die for me, whose faith shee never prov'd? Ah! have I liv'd (unnaturall I) to be My brothers murtherer, who me dearely lov'd? Ah! have I liv'd with my owne hands to kill A gallant Prince committed to my charge? And doe I gaze on the dead bodie still, And in his fathers sight my shame enlarge? Ah! have I liv'd whilst men my deeds doe scan, To be the obiect of contempt and hate? Of all abhorr'd as a most monstrous man, Since thought a Traitouror (farre worse) ingrate? Yet with my blood I'le wash away this staine, Which griefe to you, to me disgrace hath brought, Would God my name from mindes night raz'd remaine, To make my life as an unacted thought; Brave Atis now I come to pleade for grace, Although thou frown'st on my affrighted Ghost, And to revenge thy wrong this wound embrace; Thus, thus, I toile to gaine the Stygian coast. Cho. Loe, how he wounds himselfe despising paine, With leaden lights, weake legs, and head declin'd, The bodie beates the ground, as in disdaine, That of her members one hath prov'd unkind; The fainting hand falles trembling from the Sword, With this selfe slaughtering blow for shame grown red, Which straight the blood pursues, with vengeance stor'd, To drowne the same with the same floods it shed; Who of those parties can the combat show, Where both but one, one both strooke and sustain'd? Or who triumphs for this most strange o'rethrow, Where as the victor lost, the vanquish'd gain'd? CrÅ. Curs'd eyes, what suddaine change hath drown'd your lights, And made your mirthfull objects mournefull now? Ye that were still inur'd to stately sights, Since seated under an imperiall brow, Ah! clouded now with vapours drawn from cares, Are low throwne down amid'st a hell of griefe, And have no prospect, but my soules despaires, Of all the furies which afflict me, chiefe. O dead Adrastus, I absolve thy Ghost, Whose hand (I see) some destiny did charme, Thou (hated by the heavens) wast to thy cost A casuall actour, not intending harme, No doubt some angry God hath laid this snare, And whilst thy purpose was the Boare to kill, Did intercept thy shaft amidst the Aire, And threw it at my Sonne, against thy will, Ah! Sonne, must I be witnesse of thy death, Who view thee thus by violence to bleede, And yet want one on whom to poure my wrath, To take just vengeance for so vile a deede? This wretch, whose guiltlesse minde hath clear'd his hand, Loe, for his errour griev'd, unforc'd doth fall, And not as one who did in danger stand: For still he liv'd till I forgave him all. Thus have I but the heavens on whom I may Blast forth the tempest of a troubled minde; And in my soules distresse I grieve to say, That greater favour I deserv'd to finde. Scene 1. Sandanis, Croesus. Why spend you (Sir) with sighes that Princely breath, Whence Soveraignty authority should take? âO weake revenge for one when wrong'd by death, âTo yeeld him homage prostrated in blacke! That Tyrant pale (so hatefull unto us) Whose fatall shaft so great a griefe hath bred, Where he triumphs should you reare trophees thus, And weare his livery, as his captive led? No, though he might this outward blisse o'rethrow, And you (save you) of all things else might spoile, Yet whilst of one, who yeelds, no signe you show, You are victorious, and he gets the foile; Those floods of sorrow, which would drown your soule, In brests more base might better be excus'd, Since wanting sprite their passions to controule, As from their birth still to subjection us'd. But you, in whom high thoughts by nature grow, To this decay, how is your vertue come? I blush to see my Soveraigne brought so low, And Majestie by misery o'recome; Nor doe I thus to make you stupid strive, As one unnaturall, wanting sense to smart, âNo, none a Prince of kindnesse can deprive, âThe honour'd badge of an Heroicke heart. âThat pow'r supreme, by which great States doe stand, âAffections order should, but not undoe; And I could wish you might your selfe command, Which though you may not well, yet seeme to doe. CrÅ. I will not here rehearse, enlarging woes, On what just reasons now my griefe I ground, But still will entertaine my comforts foes, Whilst many a thousand thoughts my soule doe wound; What pensive pensill ever limm'd aright The sad conceipts of soule-consuming griefe? Ah! words are weake to shew the swelling height Of th'inward anguish desperate of reliefe, âThough many monarchs jealously despise âThe rising Sunne that their declining staines, And hate the Heyre who by their fall must rise, As griev'd to heare of death, or others raignes; My love to Atis otherwise appear'd, Whome, whilst for him I did my cares engage, I as a Father lov'd, as king not fear'd, The comfort not th'encombrance of mine age; And had he me (as reason would) surviv'd, Who glanc'd, and vanish'd like to lightning flashes, Then death could me not have of life depriv'd, Whilst such a PhÅnix had reviv'd my ashes. San. Let not those woes ecclipse your vertues light. CrÅ. âAh! Rage and griefe must once be at a height. San. Strive of your sorrowes (Sir) to stop the source. CrÅ. These salt eye-floods must flow, and have their course. San. That is not kingly. CrÅ. And yet it's kindly, âWhere passions domineere, they governe blindly. San. Such woefull plaints can not repaire your state. CrÅ. âVnhappie soules at least may waile their fate, âThe meanest comfort that you can returne, âIs in calamity a leave to mourne. San. what Stoicke strange, who most precise appeares, Could that youths death with tearelesse eyes behold, In all perfections ripe, though greene in yeares, A hoarie judgement under lockes of gold? No, no man lives, but must lament to see The worlds chiefe hope even in the blossome choak'd, âBut men cannot controll the Heavens decree, âAnd what is done, can never be revok'd. Let not this losse with griefe torment you more; Of which a part with you your Country beares: If wailing could your ruin'd state restore, Soules charg'd with griefe should saile in Seas of teares; Lest all our comfort dash against one shelfe, And his untimely death but hasten yours, Have pitty of your people, spare your selfe, If not to your own use, yet unto ours. CrÅ. When Sandanis I first thy faith did finde, Thou div'd so deepely in my bosome then, That since thou still (entrusted with my minde) Didst know what I conceal'd from other men: Behold I goe to open up to you, (Chiefe treasurer of all my secrets still) What high designe my Thoughts are hatching now, A physicke in some sort to ease my ill; This may unto my soule yeeld some reliefe, And for displeasures past may much content, Or else must purchase partners in my griefe, If not for me, yet with me to lament. San. This benefit must binde me with the rest To serve your Majestie, and hold you deere, And I'le be free with you, yet I protest, That what I friendly speake, you freely heare. CrÅ. Since that it hath not pleas'd the heavenly pow'rs, That of my off-spring I might comfort claime, Yet lest the ravenous course of flying how'rs Should make a prey of my respected name, I would engender such a generous broode, That the un-borne might know how I have liv'd, And this no doubt would doe my Ghost great good, By famous victories to be reviv'd: I hope to soare with fames Immortall wings, Vnlesse my high-bent thoughts themselves deceave, That having acted admirable things, I death may scorne, triumphing o're the grave; Yet have I not so setled my conceipt, That all opinions are to be despis'd; âA good advice can never come too late; This is the purpose that I have devis'd: Some Scythian Shepheards in a high disdaine, As trusted fame yet constantly relates, To plague some Medes with horrour and with paine, Did entertaine them with prodigions meates, And to content their more then Tigrish wishes, They with the Infants flesh, the Parents fed, Who not suspecting such pollute dishes, Did in their bowels bury whom they bred. Then after this abhominable crime, They fled with haste unto my fathers Court, And (first informers courting trust in time) Did as they pleas'd, of what was past report; Whil'st they (save what them help'd) all things suppress'd, Milde pitty pleading for afflictions part, His generous minde still tend'ring the distress'd, Was wonne to them by this deceiving Art. âSan. Oft men of Iudges thence have parties gone, âWhere both their eares were patent but to one. CrÅ. Then Cyaxare, Monarch of the Medes, To prosecute those fugitives to death, In indignation of my fathers deeds, Did bragge them both with all the words of wrath; My father thinking that his Court should be A Sanctuary supplicants to save, Did levie men to make the world then see, In spite of pow'r that weakenesse help should have. Thus mortall warres on every side proclaim'd, With mutuall trouble did continue long, Till both the Armies by Bellona tam'd, Did irke to venge, or to maintaine a wrong: It chanc'd whil'st peace was at the highest dearth, That all their forces did with fury fight, A sudden darknesse curtain'd up the earth, And did by violence displace the light. I thinke the Sunne for Phaeton look't sad, Else blush'd (reflecting bloud) like them he saw: For (as when wrong'd of old) with griefe gone mad, He from the world his chariot did with-draw; Yet Ignorance, which doth confusion breed, By wresting natures course, found cause of feares, Which errour did so happily succeed, That it a concord wrought, and truce from teares; Then straight there was a perfect peace begunne, And that it might more constantly indure, Astyages the King of Media's sonne, To be his Queene my sister did procure. âSan. A deadly rancor reconcil'd againe, âWith consanguinity would seal'd remaine. CrÅ. He, since his fathers age-worne course expir'd, Hath rul'd his people free from bloud or strife, Till now a Viper hath his death conspir'd, Who from his loynes extracted had his life; I meane this Cyrus, (base Cambysos brood,) Who by a Bitch, nurst with the Country swaines, (No signe observ'd importing Princely bloud:) The doggish nature of his Nurse retaines. He came against his Grand-father to field, And unexpected with a mighty pow'r, His forces forc'd, did force himselfe to yeeld, Who (captive kept) now waites for death each houre. That you may marke how great my int'rest is, This ruthfull story I did largely touch; Those circumstances shew that shame of his Doth from our glory derogate too much; Dare any Prince presume to trouble thus One whom our kingdomes favour should defend? In strict affinity combin'd with us, Yet not regarded for so great a friend. This with some joy doth smooth my stormy minde, Whil'st I for Medes against the Persians goe, I hope that both by brave effects shall finde How kinde a friend I prove, how fierce a foe. âSan. Though natures law you car'd not to transgresse, âNor this your wrong'd ally would not repaire; âYet the regard to Monarchs in distresse, âShould move the mighty with a mutuall care; âThose terrours too which thunder in your eare, âI thinke the Lydians will not well allow: âFor when the Cedar falles, the Oake may feare, âThat which o'rethrowes the Medes may trouble you. âAnd when a neighbours house they burning view, âThen their owne dangers men may apprehend; âIt better is with others to pursue, âThen be when but alone, forc'd to defend. âAh! this is but the out-side of your course, âA dangerous ambush which ambition plants: âThere may come Rivers raging from this source, âTo drown your state, whil'st such high thoughts nought daunts; âI know those new-borne monsters of your minde âHave arm'd your ravish'd heart with faire conceits, âYet may those wonders which you have divin'd, âProve traiterous projects, painted for deceits; âAnd (pardon Sir) it is not good to be âToo rashly stout, nor curiously wise, âLest that you leave that which we certaine see, âAnd not attaine to that which you devise. CrÅ. I grant indeed (this very few shall know) Though I professe but to relieve my friend, My thoughts conceive, as successe best may show, And not without great cause, a greater end: You see how fortune nought but change affects, Some are reproach'd, that others may be prais'd, And every age brings forth some strange effects, âSome men must fall, that others may be rais'd: I doubt not, you have heard who was the first, For warring with the world, whom fame revives, Who had of soveraignty, so great a thirst, That it could not be quench'd with thousands lives: Even he who first obtain'd the name of Iove, And rests reputed for his glorious acts, The most imperious of the pow'rs above, Who vowes and offerings of the world exacts; He all his time in state did terrour breath, Borne to acquaint the world with warre and dearth, Whil'st fertile still in misery and death, Two fatall furies that afflict the earth; Yet since his course (the worlds first plague) was past, When his proud race had many ages raign'd, That Empire too did perish at the last, And what it lost, by martiall Medes was gain'd; This was the cause of that great kingdomes fall; A Prince who could not judge of Princely parts, With losse of Scepter, honour, life, and all, To buy base joyes, sold all his Subjects hearts; To that disastred Monarchies decay, Th' aspiring Persians purpose to succeed: But I intend their lofty course to stay, And that in time, ere that it throughly speed; The Persians once the Lydians force must prove, And O! who knowes but that it is ordain'd At the tribunall of the States above, That I should raigne where famous Ninus raign'd? This all the hoste of heaven oft-times foretels, To this the Gods of Greece my minde have mov'd, And he that in Arabia's desart dwels, By his response this enterprise approv'd. âSan. Thus still in love with what we minde to doe, âWhat we affect, we fairest still conceive, âThis feeds our humour, whil'st (selfe-flatterers) loe, âTo shew our wit, we would our selves deceive; âVaine hopes so maske all doubts, you cannot spy âWhat secret danger this designe doth beare; âBut whil'st well view'd with an indifferent eye, âThere want not grounds, where fore-sight may find feare: âYou unadvis'dly purpose to pursue âA barbarous people opposite to peace, âWho but by robbery to their greatnesse grew, âAnd would for each light cause, the warres embrace; âNo dainty silkes, dipt in Assyrian dye, âDoe decke their bodies, to abase their mindes: âSkinnes reft from beasts them cloath, who danger ply, âNot mov'd by flattering Sunnes, nor bragging windes; âThey simply feed, and are not griev'd each day, âWith stomackes cloyd, decocting divers meates, âThey fare not as they would, but as they may, âOf judgement sound, not carried with conceits. âThose ancient customes which they strictly hold, âMake all things easie, that they feele no paine, âThis cooles the summers heate, kils winters cold: âThis makes the Rivers dry, the Mountaines plaine. âThey whose ambition poverty did bound, âOf Lydia's dainties if they once doe taste, âWill have in hatred straight their barren ground, âAnd all our treasures insolently waste; âTo governe such, although that we prevaile, âYou shall but buy vexation with your bloud, âAnd doe your selfe, and yours, if fortune faile, âFrom Soveraignty (by time secur'd) seclude; Yea, though this rash desire your judgement blindes, I for my part must praise the Gods for you, Who have not yet inspir'd the Persians mindes, To waste with warre all Lydia long ere now. CrÅ. Those flames, which burn my brest, must once burst out, Your counsell for more quiet mindes I leave, And be you still thought wise, so I prove stout, I'le conquer more, or lose the thing I have. CÅlia. Ah! am I forc'd out of afflictions store, For my mindes ease a few sad words to straine? But yet unlode it now, to lode it more, I empty but mine eyes to fill againe; My soule must sound even as my passions strike, Whil'st sighes and teares would faine afford reliefe; My brest and eyes are both accurst alike, The Cabinet of care, the Springs of griefe; O cruell heaven, fierce starre, unhappy fate, Too foule injustice of celestiall pow'rs! Whose high disdaine to me with partiall hate The comfort of the world (poore world) devoures: Curst be the day in which I first was borne, When lying tongues affirm'd I came to light, A monstrous blasphemy, a mighty scorne, Since where darke sorrow breeds an endlesse night; Would God I then had chanc'd this life to leave, The tombe straight taking what the wombe did give, Then alwayes buried, changing but the grave, I had not liv'd to dye, but dy'd to live. What profited to me my Parents joyes, VVho with such pompe did solemnize my birth, Since still my soule must flote amidst annoyes, So to defray one dramme of tasted mirth? And it did onely serve to make me know The height of horrour, threatning to succeed; I was but rais'd up high, to be brought low, That short liv'd joyes might endlesse anguish breed; Whil'st nothing did for my confusion lacke, All my best deeds did but betray my State, My vertues too were guilty of my wracke, And warr'd against me, banded with my fate; For whil'st my Virgin-yeares with praise I past, Which did (ah that it did) too much import, My modest eye told that my minde was chast, Which gain'd the warrant of the worlds report: âAnd all should have a great respect to fame, âNo greater dowry then a spotlesse name. Faire beauties Goddesse, thou can'st beare record, My offring never made thine Altar rich; Lascivious fancies highly I abhorr'd, Whose free-borne thoughts no folly could bewitch; Till happily (ah so it seem'd to some) O but unhappily the end hath prov'd, All this, and more, to Atis eares did come, Who straight did like, and after liking lov'd; He to our eares, his purpose did impart, Not lip-sicke-lover like, with words farre sought, Whose tongue was but an agent for his heart. Yet could not tell the tenth part that it thought; And lest his travels should have seem'd to tend My honours fame by fancies to betray, He brought his wishes to a lawfull end, And in effect, affection did bewray; There Iuno, president of wedlockes vow, And Hymen with his odoriferous cote, With sacred customes did our love allow, Whil'st th'ominous Owles no crosses did devote; The blessing that this marriage did procure, It was too great to have continued long: âA thing too vehement cannot endure, Our joyes farre past the reach of any tongue; We ever did full satisfaction finde, Yet with satiety were never cloyd, But seem'd two bodies, manag'd by one minde, Such was the happinesse that I enjoy'd; He lov'd me dearely, I obey'd his will, Proud of my selfe, because that I was his, A harmony remain'd betwixt us still, Who each in th' other plac'd their soules chiefe blisse: This mov'd th'immortals to a high disdaine, That thus two worldlings, who of death were heires, Should in a Paradise of joyes remaine, Which did exceed, at least did equall theirs; But chiefly Iuno did despight it most, Who through a jealousie still jarres with Iove, That body-prison'd soules of that could boast, Which she (although heavens Queen) had not above; Thus even for envy of our rare delights, The fatall Sisters (by the heavens suborn'd) Of my soules treasure clos'd the lovely lights, By which they thought the earth too much adorn'd. O but he is not dead, he lives in me. Ah, but I live not: for I dy'd in him: How can the one without the other be? If death have set his eyes, mine must looke dimme; Since to my sight that Sunne no more appear'd, From whom my beauties borrowed all their rayes: A long eclipse, that never shall be clear'd, Hath darkened all the poynts of my sad dayes; Aye me, I live too long, he dy'd too soone, Thus still the worst remaine, the best depart, Of him who told how this curs'd deed was done, The words (like swords) shall ever wound my heart. Fierce tyrant death, who in thy wrath did'st take One halfe of me, and left one halfe behinde: Take this to thee, or give me th' other backe, Be wholly cruell, or be no way kinde; But whil'st I live (beleeve) thou canst not dye, O! even in spite of death, yet still my choice, Oft with the inward al-beholding eye, I thinke I see thee, and I heare thy voyce; And to content my languishing desire, To ease my minde, each thing some helpe affords; Thy fanci'd forme doth oft such faith acquire, That in all sounds I apprehend thy words: Then with such thoughts my memory to wound, I call to minde thy lookes, thy words, thy grace, Where thou didst haunt, yet I adore the ground, And where thou stept, O sacred seemes that place! My solitary walkes, my widow'd bed, My driry sighes, my sheets oft bath'd with teares, These shall record what life by me is led, Since first sad newes breath'd death into mine eares. Though for more paine, yet spar'd a space by death, Thee first I lov'd, with thee all love I leave: For my chast flames, which quench'd were with thy breath, Can kindle now no more but in thy grave. By night I wish for day, by day for night, Yet wish farre more, that none of both might be; But most of all, that banish'd from the light I were no more, their constant change to see. At night whil'st deeply musing of my State, I goe to summe with sighes my wonted joyes, An agony then (in a sad conceit) Doth blot the blubred count with new annoyes; When Sleep, the brother most resembling death, Of darkenesse childe, and father unto rest, Doth bound (though not restraine) confused breath, That it may vent, but not with words exprest; Then with my sprite thou dost begin to speake, With sugred speeches to appease my griefe; And my bruis'd heart which labour'd long to breake; Doth in this comfort fain'd, finde some reliefe; Yea, if our soules remain'd united so, This late divorce would no way vexe my minde, But when awaking, it augments my woe. Whil'st this a dreame, and me a wretch I finde. If never happy, O thrise happy I! But happy more had happinesse remain'd, Yet then excessive joy had made me dye; Since such delights, what heart could have sustain'd? Why waste I thus, whil'st vainely I lament, The pretious treasure of that swift past-time? Ah, pardon me (deare love) for I repent My lingring here, my fate, and not my crime: Since first thy body did enrich the Tombe, In this spoil'd world, my eye no pleasure sees, And Atis, Atis, Loe I come, I come, To be thy mate, amongst the Myrtle trees. Chorus. âLoe all our time even from our birth, âIn misery almost exceeds: âFor, where we finde a moments mirth, âA month of mourning still succeeds; âBesides the evils that Nature breeds, âWhose paines doe us each day appall, âInfirmities which frailty sends, âThe losse of that which fortune lends; âAnd such disasters as oft fall, âYet to farre worse our states are thrall, âWhil'st wretched man with man contends, âAnd every one his whole force bends, âHow to procure anothers losses, âBut this torments us most of all: âThe minde of man, which many a fancy tosses, âDoth forge unto it selfe a thousand crosses. O how the soule with all her might, Doth her celestiall forces straine, That so she may attaine the light Of natures wonders, which remaine Hid from our eyes! we strive in vaine âTo seeke out things that are unsure: âIn Sciences to seeme profound, âWe dive so deepe, we finde no ground; âAnd the more knowledge we procure, âThe more it doth our mindes allure, âOf mysteries the depth to sound; âThus our desires we never bound; âWhich by degrees thus drawn on still, âThe memory may not endure; âBut like the Tubs which Danaus daughters fill, âDoth drinke no oftner then constrain'd to spill. Yet how comes this? and O how can Cleare knowledge thus (the soules chiefe treasure) Be cause of such a crosse to man, Which should afford him greatest pleasure? This is, because we cannot measure The limits that to it belong, But (bent to tempt forbidden things) Doe soare too high with Natures wings, Still weakest whil'st we thinke us strong; The heavens which hold, we do them wrong To try their grounds, and what thence springs, This crosse upon us justly brings: With knowledge, knowledge is confus'd, And growes a griefe ere it be long; âThat which a blessing is when rightly us'd, âDoth grow the greatest crosse when once abus'd. Ah! what avaiels this unto us, Who in this vaile of woes abide, With endlesse toyles to study thus To learn the thing that heaven would hide? And trusting to too blinde a guide, To spy the Planets how they move, And too (transgressing common Barres) The constellation of the starres, And all that is decreed above, Whereof (as oft the end doth prove) A secret sight our wel-fare marres, And in our brests breeds endlesse warres, Whil'st what our horoscopes foretell, Our expectations doe disprove: Those apprehended plagues prove such a hell, That then we would unknow them till they fell. This is the pest of great estates, They by a thousand meanes devise How to fore-know their doubtfull fates; And like new Gyants, scale the skies, Heavens secret store-house to surprise; Which sacrilegious skill we see With what great paine they apprehend it, And then how foolishly they spend it. To learne the thing that once must be; Why should we seeke our destiny? If it be good, we long attend it; If it be ill, none may amend it: Such knowledge but torments the minde; Let us attend the heavens decree: For those whom this ambiguous Art doth blinde, May what they seeke to flye, the rather finde. And loe of late, what hath our King By his preposterous travels gain'd, In searching out each threatned thing, Which Atis horoscope contain'd? For what the heavens had once ordain'd, That by no meanes he could prevent; And yet he labours to finde out Through all the Oracles about, Of future things the hid event. This doth his raging minde torment: (Now in his age unwisely stout) To fight with Cyrus, but no doubt The heavens are griev'd thus to heare told Long ere the time their darke intent. Let such of Tantalus the state behold, Who dare the secrets of great Iove unfold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 5. Scene 1. Cyrus, Harpagus. Let us triumph o're them (though proud of late) Whose glory now doth with their greatnesse faile: Since with their fortune forfeiting their state: No warre 's approv'd unlesse that it prevaile: The world, that whil'st we fought, did doubtfull stand, As for the one, ordain'd to be a prey, Saw how the heavens plac'd lightning in my hand, Those thund'ring downe, who would not us obey: Goe pay our vowes, ere enterprising more; The Gods detest a minde that is ingrate; And who delight their Deities to adore, Are alwaies bent to stablish their estate; Cause burden Altars, smoke each sacred place With Bullockes, Incense, Odours of all kindes; âBut none can give the Gods (still great in grace) âA sacrifice more sweet, than thankefull mindes. Harp. Though all who partners are of th' earth and ayre, Still whil'st tapestred with this azure pale, If for nought else, yet for those gifts least rare, To serve th' all-pow'rfull pow'rs, should never faile; Yet there are some whom successe hath design'd, Whose names are written in respected scroules, Whom benefits (not ordinary) binde To love them more then life, yea, then their soules: Of those that you are one, your deeds declare, Of whom amid'st innumerable broiles, Even from your cradle they have had a care, And led you safe through many dangerous toiles; Though of the troubles of your youth I see, You have not heard the wonderfull discourse, I them remember, who did chance to be An actor in your Tragicke-Comicke course. Cyrus. The accidents which in our nonage chance, A ripened age not to remembrance brings, Like fabulous dreames which darkenesse doth advance, That are by day disdain'd as frivolous things: For, our conceptions are not then so strong That they can leave impressions long behinde, Yet mixe (deare friend) old griefes new joyes among, And call afflicted infancy to minde. Harp. Who would not wonder at thy wondrous fate, Whom (even or borne) destruction did attend, Whil'st ere thou could'st offend, pursu'd by hate, Even then to end what now shall never end? Your mother first her fathers minde did sting, Whil'st once he dream'd, which yet his soule confounds, That of a tree which from her wombe did spring, Th'umbragious branches, darkened Asias bounds; Then to the Magies straight he gave in charge To try what this strange vision did presage, VVho having studied their darke Art at large, Gave this response with a propheticke rage: That once his daughter should a sonne bring forth, Who should (by valour gaining great renowne) Make vanquish'd Asia witnesse of his worth; But from his grand-father first reave the Crowne. This to Astyages a terrour bred, Who (vainely bent to scorne the heavens decree) His daughter (out of policy) would wed, To some weake stranger of no great degree. And to Cambyses, who of her made choice, He, for his Country (then contemn'd) gave eare, Whom by your birth the Princesse did rejoyce, And gave her father further cause of feare, âThus tyranny (their brood whose courage failes) âDoth force the Parents in despaire to fall, âTo fight a dastard, proud when it prevailes, âBut yet (as fear'd of all,) doth still feare all; âAnd tyrants no security can finde, âFor every shadow frights a guilty minde. This Monarch then who could not dreame of harmes, Whose guards did glance all still with steele array'd, Then whil'st he liv'd secure from forraigne Armes, A babe, scarce borne, and his, did make afraid. And whil'st Lucina the last helpe did make, As if some ugly monster had beene borne, A Minotaure, a Centaure, or a Snake, The peoples terrour, and the Mothers scorne; The Grand-childes birth, which justly should impart, To grand-fathers the greatest cause of joyes, Did (long ere wounded, making him to smart) Involve him in a maze of sad annoyes; And to prevent what did him fondly fright, By giving cause of a deserved hate, He sought by robbing you the new-found light, To make your birth and buriall of one date. Soone after this he sent for me in haste, Whom at that time (and not in vaine) he lov'd, And told the summe of all things that were past, By which his marble-minde seem'd nothing mov'd; Yet in the same, as he would let me know, Though pitty none, some horrour did remaine, Whil'st damn'd in substance, to seeme cleere in show, Your bloud his heart, but not his hand should staine. âThus having lull'd asleepe their judgement still, âThe wicked would extenuate their crimes, âNot knowing those who but allow of ill, âAs actors guilty, differ but in times. With his vile fault he would have burden'd me, Whom straight he charg'd an Innocent to slay; I promis'd to performe his rash decree, Well weighing whom, not what I should obey; When I had parted from his Highnesse face, And carried you (then swadled) with me too, Whil'st horrour did congeale my bloud, a space I stood perplex'd, not knowing what to doe, And (as to purge my part) even shedding teares, By troupes of passions griefe, my soule assail'd, Thus (when distress'd for easing others feares,) Th'intended death of you, your murd'rers wail'd; For him I sent a servant of mine owne, VVho for the time was heards-man to the King, To whom I made all my Commission knowne, But as enjoyn'd to him, shew'd every thing; Delivering you with an unwilling breath, Whom of pure gold, a glistring robe array'd, I threatned him with many a cruell death, If that your death were any way delay'd; Straight then to execute the Tyrants doome, He from my sight did all astonish'd goe, Too great a charge for such a simple Groome, The shew of Majestie amaz'd him so; What man (not wondring) can by deeds behold The providence of all-commanding Iove, Whose brazen edicts cannot be contrould: âFirme are the Statutes of the States above: âThat mortall whom a Deities savour shields, âNo worldly force is able to confound, âHe may securely walke through dangers fields, âTimes and occasions are to serve him bound: For loe, before the heards-man was come home, His wife had chanc'd a breath-lesse childe to beare, Who wondred so to see her husband come, While by his conscience crush'd, he quak'd for feare; And straight she curious grew to know the forme, How he a babe so beautifull obtain'd; Who her of all did suddenly informe, And to what cruelty he was constrain'd; She quickly then th' occasion to embrace, (No doubt inspir'd by some celestiall pow'r) Pray'd that her infant might supply your place, Yet where no beasts his body might devoure, So shall we have (saith she) a double gaine, Since our owne childe shall get a stately tombe, And we a Princely brood, which may remaine, Still nurst with us as th'issue of my wombe. The husband lik't so well his wives designe, That he perform'd all what she did require, And when I had directed one of mine, This Tragedies last act, who might enquire: My man who spy'd a babe there breathlesse lye, With that rich funerall furniture array'd, Told what the fellow told, (a generous lye) So that thus try'd, I trusted what they said. In end, Time (posting with houre-feather'd wings) Had given you strength, with others of your yeares You haunted games, not nephewes unto Kings, But for that time admitted for your Peeres, They faile call fortune blinde, she sight bewray'd, And your authority by lot enlarg'd, In pastorall sports, who still the Scepter sway'd, And as but borne for that, that best discharg'd: With other children then, as once it chanc'd, A Noble-man of Medeas Sonne remain'd, Who swolne with envy to see you advanc'd, Your childish charge with scornfull words disdain'd; You raging at that proud attempt of his, Did punish him, as it became a Prince, I doubt now (Sir) if that you thinke of this: The rest of rashnesse did your deed convince. Cyrus. Though now my breast doth greater thoughts embrace, Of youthfull sports, yet do not spare to speake; âLet cares alternatly give pleasure place: âThat which is bended still, must sometime breake. Harp. The childes great Father did inform the King, How that so base a boy his Sonne abus'd, And of the guard one hasted you to bring, As for an odious crime to be accus'd; But when the King (expostulating long) By terrours striv'd to cast your courage downe: You boldly said, that you had done no wrong, To punish one who had contemn'd your Crowne; You so magnanimous amaz'd to finde, Whil'st pausing long with an attentive Eye, That speech imperious told the King your kinde: Whose brood but th'Eagles durst have soar'd so high? The fained Father to the King was brought, Who (fear'd for torture) telling truth in time, Where he reward deserv'd, but pardon sought, As if the saving you had beene a crime. Then (as it seem'd) delighted with the rest, The King did cause a sumptuous feast prepare, And me desir'd as his most speciall guest, That with my Sonne I would to Court repaire; When I was come, the King great joy disclos'd, And sooth'd my words which did his chance applaud, But for another end then I suppos'd: âWhat fairer cloke then courtesie for fraud? When th'absence of the Sunne did darknesse breed, The Candles light inheriting his place, On my Sonnes flesh they caus'd my selfe to feed, Then did upbraid me with his bloudlesse face; VVhat anguish, or what rage o're-flow'd my soule, A loving Father may imagine best, Yet at that time I did my rage controull, But laid it high up in a stormie brest. Cyrus. Some of the wise-men then I heard remain'd, VVho from their former sentence did recoyle, And said, no danger was, since I had raign'd, Then did dismisse me for my native soile; VVhere when I had my blooming season spent, To weakened wrath your lines did strength afford, Informing us that many Medes were bent For his great cruelty to leave their Lord; And wish'd (if to their Scepter I aspir'd) That I should move the Persians to rebell, VVhich did succeed even as my soule desir'd: For they disdain'd in bondage base to dwell; VVhen my encourag'd troups all arm'd did stand, Ere they from Strangers could attend releefe, I quickly march'd, encountring with that band, Of which the King had chanc'd to make you chiefe. Harp. âLoe how those wretches whom the heavens would wrack, â(To plagues expos'd) of judgement are unarm'd: âThe King of me his Captaine straight did make, âAnd look't for help of him whom he had harm'd; âYet was th'old wrong so rooted in my heart, âMy Countries thraldome, and mine owne disgrace, âThat all the horrours mischiefe could impart âSeem'd nought to me, so my disdaine took place. Cyr. âOn those whom they have wrong'd, none should relye: âIust rancour unreveng'd, can never dye. Harp. This enterprise at first so well did speed, That since, your Greatnesse still began to rise, Which may by time Io brave a story breed, As may be pretious in all Princes eyes. Cyr. Behold how CrÅsus with his riches blinde, Durst even encounter with my warre-like band; And whil'st a prosp'rous course betray'd his minde, Did not suspect what pow'r was in my hand; But he and his confederates have seene How victory doth still my troupes attend, And Persia must be once all Asia's Queene, On whom for servants Princes shall depend; Now CrÅsus is o'recome, this Towne surpris'd, And Lydia charg'd with gold, doth yeeld rich spoyles; The League unprosp'rous, Ãgypt hath despis'd, This is the happy end of all our toiles. But ah! one sowre unseasons all my sweets, That gallant man who was my Mate in armes, Whose praise through all the peopled circuit fleets, And with his love each generous courage warmes; Then when (though weake in troups) in courage strong, Th'Ãgyptian Chariots desperately he charg'd There (whil'st he fought infortunately long) Mars from terrestriall bands his soule enlarg'd. Harp. No doubt that Dame this trouble hardly beares, Who onely seem'd for him to like of life, I heard him (whil'st she bath'd his breast with teares) Oft wish by proofe to merit such a wife. When their farewell was seal'd, last speeches spent, She kiss'd the Coach that did containe her trust, And with eyes bigge with pearle, gaz'd where he went, Still till her sight was choak'd with clouds of dust. Cyrus. And have you then not heard, his death but prov'd The black beginning of a bloudy Scene? His wife Panthea at the first not mov'd, Seem'd as she had some marble image beene; The body that had oft her fancies fir'd, She caus'd beare out of sight, still deare, though dead; But where the River ranne, when once retir'd, She 'twixt her bosomes Rounds entomb'd his head; And then from Rage she borrowed some reliefe: For sorrow by degrees, a passage seeks, Vapouring forth sighs, which made a cloud of griefe, A mighty storme of teares rain'd downe her cheeks; Then, whil'st her Eyes the wonted object miss'd, With heavy looks resolving fatall haste, Pale senselesse lips she prodigally kiss'd, With as great ardour then as in times past. I posted thither, bent to have releev'd This Lady of a portion of her woes. Heaven beare me witnesse! I was greatly griev'd, Who would to save one friend, spare hosts of foes, She first a space me passionately ey'd, Then with those words, her lips did slowly move, My husband, loe, hath valorously dy'd, As of your friendship, worthy of my love. âMy comming but encreas'd griefes starving store: âFor, till that passion of it selfe expire, âAll kinde of comfort but augments it more, âLike drops of oyle thrown on a mighty fire. A constant count'nance though I striv'd to make, And what her woes diminish might, did tell; That comfort which I gave, I could not take, And scarcely could throw forth my last farewell; When I had left her but a little space, She did discharge the Eunuchs from her sight, Then pray'd her Nurse to bury in one place Her and her Lord, as they deserv'd of right; Last, looking on his corps, she drew a sword, And even as if her soule had flown in him, (Pure snows in Crimson dy'd) imbrac'd her Lord, Whil'st beauties blubbred Starres were waxing dim; Then bent to fall, when her they could not raise, (As scorning to survive their prosp'rous state) In emulation of their Ladies praise, The Eunuchs did precipitate their fate. O sweet Panthea, rich in rarest parts, I must admire thy ghost though thou be gone! Who might'st have made a Monarchy of hearts, Yet loath'd unlawfull loves, and lov'd but one; O wond'rous wonders, wonders wond'rous rare! A woman constant, such a beauty chast, A minde so pure, joyn'd with a face so faire, With vertue beauty in one person plac't; Both were well match'd as any could devise, Whose death confirmes the union of their life; He valorous, she vertuous, both wise, She worthy such a Mate, he such a wife. And Harpagus, lest that it should be thought, That of brave mindes the memory may dye; Cause build a stately Tombe with Statues wrought, Where both their bodies with respect may lye. Harp. I'le raise a Pyramide of CrÅsus spoils, Where of their worth each part shall be compris'd, But how to do in these tumultuous broils, Now time requires that you were well advis'd: Your adversary doth attend your will; This hauty Towne for feare to fall doth bow, And therefore pardon, ransome, quite, or kill, Do what you please, none can controll us now. Cyr. As for old CrÅsus, I am else resolv'd, He with some captives whom I keep in store Shall have their bodies by the fire dissolv'd, As offerings to the Gods whom I adore. My Souldiers paines this City shall defray, Since by their meanes it hath beene gain'd for us, I yeeld it unto them, as their just prey, Who taste the sweetnesse of their travels thus; Of other things we shall so well dispose That our renowne through all the world shall shine, Till Cyrus name give terror to all those, Who dare against his Soveraignty repine. Scene 2. Nuntius. Chorus. Ah! to what part shall I my steps addresse, Of bondage base the burden to eschue? Loe, desolation, ruine, and distresse With horrour do my native home pursue; And now poore Countrey, take my last farewell, Farewell all joy, all comfort, all delight. Cho. What heavy tydings hast thou now to tell, Who tear'st thy garments thus? what forc'd thy flight? Nunt. I tell the wracke of us, and all who live Within the circuit of this wretched foile. Cho. A hideous shout we heard the Citie give, Have foes prevail'd, do they her beauty spoile? Nunt. They may it spoile. Cho. And is our Soveraigne slaine? Nunt. No, but scarce scap't doth live in danger still. Chor. Then let our mindes no more in doubt remaine, And must we yeeld to that proud Strangers will? Nunt. You know how CrÅsus at advantage lay, Still seeking meanes to curbe the Persians pride, And how th'Assyrians had assign'd a day When led by him, they battell would abide; But Cyrus having heard how that they would Against his State so great an armie bring, Straight raising forces, providently bold, Prevents, invades, o're-comes, and takes our King. âCho. This shews a Captaine both expert and brave, âWho wisely doth advise, performe with speed, No circumstance (friend) unrelated leave, Which with our Kings did our confusion breed. Nunt. When CrÅsus saw that Cyrus came so soone, He stood a while with a distracted minde, Yet what time would permit, left nought undone, But made his musters, march'd his foe to finde. Our stately troups that for rich armes excell'd, And with umbragious feathers fann'd the aire, With insolency, not with courage swell'd, A triumph dream'd, scarce how to fight took care. The Lydian horse-men never stain'd, but true, And for their worth, through all the world renown'd, Them chiefly Cyrus labour'd to subdue, And this device for that effect was found: Untrussing all their baggage by the way Each of the Camels for his charge did beare A grim-fac'd Groome, who did himselfe array With what in Persia horsemen use to weare; To them th'infantery did follow next, A solid squadron like a brasen wall; But those in whom all confidence was fix'd, The brave Cavallery came last of all, Then Cyrus by the raines his Courser tooke, And bravely mounted, holding out his hands With an assured, and imperious look Went kindling courage through the flaming bands; He them desir'd, who at deaths game would strive To spare none of their foes in any forme; But as for CrÅsus to take him alive, And keep him captive for a greater storme: Where famous Hellus doth to Hermus post, To give another both his strength, and name; Our army ranne against a greater host, To grace it likewise with our force and fame. Each troupe a time with equall valour stood, Till giving place at length we took the chace, While as the River ranne to hide our bloud, But still his borders blush'd at our disgrace; For when the Camels to the field were come, Our horses all affrighted at their sight, Ranne raging backe againe, and of them some Disordering ranks, put many to the flight; Yet some who had beene us'd with martiall traines The stratagem (though out of time) perceiv'd, And lighting downe (red heights rais'd from green plains) Did vengeance urge of those who them deceiv'd; There whil'st the world prov'd prodigall of breath, The headlesse tronks lay prostrated in heaps; This field of funerals sacred unto death, Did paint out horrour in most hideous shapes: Whil'st men unhors'd, horses unmastred, stray'd, Some call'd on those whom they most dearly lov'd, Some rag'd, some groan'd, some sigh'd, roar'd, promis'd, pray'd, As blows, falls, faintnesse, paine, hope, anguish mov'd. Those who then scap'd (like beasts unto a den) A fortresse took where valour none renownes, âWalls are for women, and the fields for men, âNo Towne can keep a man, but men keep Townes; And we were scarcely entred at the Ports, When straight the Enemies did the Towne enclose, And quickly rear'd huge artificiall Forts, Which did to the besieg'd more paine impose: All martiall Engines were for battery found, At like encounters, which had ear'st prevail'd, Whil'st both they us'd the vantage of the ground, And borrow'd help from Art, where Nature fail'd; They alwayes compassing our Trench about, Still where the walls were weake, did make a breach, Which (straight repairing) darts were hurled out, To kill all those who came where we might reach; There all the bolts of death, edg'd by disdaine, Which many curious wits enclin'd to ill, Whil'st kindled by revenge, or hope of gaine, Had skill to make, were put in practise still; Yet as we see it oft-times hath occurr'd, Where least we did suspect, we were surpris'd, Whil'st Fortune and the Fates in one concurr'd, That in Fames rolls our fall might be compris'd: That side of Sardis, farre from all regard, Which doth next Tmolus lye, thought most secure, Through this presumption, whil'st without a guard, All Lydia's o'rethrow did with speed procure: As one of ours (unhappily it chanc'd) To reach his helmet, that had scap't his hand, Alongst that steepie part his steps advanc'd, And was returning back unto his band; He was well mark'd by one, who had not spar'd To tempt all dangers which might make us thralls: For Cyrus had proclaim'd a great reward To him whose steps first trod the conquer'd walls; And this companion seeing without stay One in his sight that craggie passage clime, Straight on his foot-steps followed all the way, And many a thousand hasted after him; Then all that durst resist, were quickly kill'd, The rest who fled, no where secure could be: For every street was with confusion fill'd; There was no corner from some mischiefe free. O what a piteous clamour did arise Of ravish'd virgins, and of widow'd wives! Who pierc'd the heavens with lamentable cryes, And having lost all comfort, loath'd their lives. Whil'st those proud Victors would themselves have stain'd With all the wrongs that Pride, or power could use, They by a charge from Cyrus were restrain'd, And durst no more their captives thus abuse. Chor. No doubt but high mishaps did then abound, Whil'st with disdaine the Conqu'rours bosome boyld, As some the sword, disgrace did some confound, Not onely houses, Temples too were spoyld. âWhat misery more great can be devis'd, âThen is a Cities when by force surpris'd? But whil'st that stately Towne was thus distress'd, What did become of our unhappy King? Nunt. Then when the Enemy had his state possest, And that confusion seaz'd on every thing: He scarcely first could trust his troubled sight, (The Fortune past transported had him so) Yet having eyes who can deny the light? He saw himselfe inferiour to his foe; And apprehending there whil'st left alone, How that his judgement long had beene betray'd, (As metamorphos'd in a marble stone) His ravish'd thoughts in admiration stray'd; But such a weight of woes not us'd to beare, He first was griev'd, then rag'd, and last despair'd, Till through excessive feare, quite freed from feare, He for his safetie then no further car'd; And never wishd he so to have long life, But death farre further was affected now, Still seeking danger in the bounds of strife, So he were sure to dye, he car'd not how; Whilst furies thus were fostred in his brest, Him suddenly a Souldier chanc'd to meet, As insolent as any of the rest, Who drunk with bloud, ran raging through the street; And wanting but an object to his ire, He sought to him, and he to him againe; I know not which of them did most desire, The one to slay, the other to be slaine; But whil'st so base a hand to wring aloft, Did to so great a Monarch threaten death, His eldest Sonne, who (as you have heard oft) Was barr'd from making benefit of breath: I cannot tell you well, nor in what forme, If that the destinies had so ordain'd, Or if of passions an impetuous storme Did raze the strings that had his tongue restrain'd; But when he saw his Syre in danger stand, He with those words a mighty shout did give: Thou furious Stranger stay, hold, hold thy hand, Kill not King CrÅsus, let my Father live; The other hearing this, his hand retyr'd, And call'd his Kings commandement to minde; High were those aymes to which his thoughts aspir'd, Whom for great fortunes this rare chance design'd; Now when that CrÅsus, who for death long long'd, Was quite undone, by being thus preserv'd, As both by life, and death, then doubly wrong'd, Whil'st but by fates for further harme reserv'd; He with sad sighs those accents did accord: Now let the heavens do all the ill they can, Which would not unto me the grace afford, That I might perish like a private man, Ah, must I live to sigh that I was borne, Charactring shame in a dejected face? Ah, must I live, to my perpetuall scorne, The abject object, pointed for disgrace? Yet this unto his soule more sorrow bred, He (scorne pretending state) as King array'd, Was with great shouts ridiculously led Backe to the Tent, whereas their Emp'rour stay'd: Then that he might his misery conceive, Those robes so rich, were all exchang'd with chains, And prisons strictnesse bragg'd him with the grave, So soone as death could make a choice of paines; They caus'd in haste a pile of wood to make, And in the mid'st where all men might him spie, Caus'd binde the captive King unto a stake, With fourteene others of the Lydians by; There (as if offerings fit to purge the state) Foes sought with flames their ruine to procure, Though Iove prepostrous piety doth hate: âNo sacrifice is sweet, which is not pure. Now whil'st the fire was kindling round about, As to some pow'rfull God, who pray'd, or vow'd, With eyes bent up, and with his hands stretch'd out: O! Solon, Solon, CrÅsus cry'd aloud; Some hearing him to utter such a voice, Who said that Cyrus curious was to know (When dying now) what deity was his choice, Did him request his last intent to show: His exclamation was (said he) on one, With whom he wish'd (their frailty so to see) That all who ever trusted in a Throne, Had but conferr'd a space as well as he; Then there he told what Solon had him showne, Whil'st at his Court (which flourish'd then) arriv'd; How worldly blisse might quickly be o're-throwne, And not accomplish'd was, while as one liv'd; Whil'st forth salt flouds attending troupes did powre; He shew how much the wise-man did disdaine Those who presum'd of wealth, or worldly pow'r, By which none could a perfect blisse obtaine; This speech did Cyrus move to ponder much The great uncertainty of worldly things, As thinking that himselfe might once be such, Since thrall'd to Fortunes throne, like other Kings; Then such a patterne standing him before, Whom envy once, then pitie did attend, He to our King did liberty restore, And with his life did Solons fame extend; Yet him the fire still threatned to devoure, Which (rising high) could hardly be controll'd, But O devotion! then appear'd thy pow'r, Which to subdue the heavens makes worldlings bold! To quench the flames, whil'st divers toild in vaine, (Iove mov'd by prayer) as CrÅsus did require, The azure Cisterns open'd did remaine, And clouds fell downe in flouds to quench the fire. Then whil'st the Souldiers did the Citie sack, To save the same (as to his Countrey kinde) The hopelesse CrÅsus thus to Cyrus spake, With words which pitie melted from his minde: Great Prince, to whom all Nations now succumbe, And do thy yoke so willingly embrace, That it some comfort gives to be o're-come By one whose glory graces our disgrace; Since now I am constrain'd your thrall to be, I must conforme my selfe unto my fate, And cannot hold my peace, whereas I see, That which may wrong the greatnesse of your state; Your state is spoil'd by not suspected pow'rs, If this rich Citie thus do rest ore-throwne, Which now no more is mine, but is made yours: And therefore (Sir) have pittie of your owne; Yea, though the losse of such a populous Towne, Both rich, and yours, your minde could nothing move, Yet thinke of this, which may import your Crowne, A peece of policy which time will prove: The haughty Persians borne with stubborne mindes, Who but for poverty first followed you, Their matchlesse worth in armes large Asia findes, Their feare is falne upon all Nations now; But if you suffer them in such a sort To be made rich with plenteous Lydia's spoiles, Not able then their conquest to support, The vanquish't by their fall the victor foils; Let not vain pleasures entertaine their sights: âRest wealth, wealth pride, pride warre, warre ruine breeds, Whil'st (faint through pleasures, weakened with delights) No thought of honour from base breasts proceeds. Then Cyrus straight approving what he spake, His souldiers were from pretious spoyls restrain'd, Whil'st he the tenth part did pretend to take, A fatall off'ring for the Gods ordain'd; This is the summe of our disastrous state, We must a Stranger serve, as thrall'd long since; With losse of all which he possest of late Our King bought breath, a poore thing for a Prince. Chor. O wretched people! O unhappy King! Our joyes are spoyl'd, his happinesse expir'd, And no new chance can any comfort bring, Where destinies to ruine have conspir'd, Go wofull messenger, hold on thy course, For, to have heard too much, it irks our eares; And we shall note of this thy sad discourse, With sighs each accent, and each point with teares. Croesus. Loe! I who late did thunder from a Throne, Am now a wretch whom every one disdaines; My treasure, honour, state, and freedome gone; No kinde of comfort, no, nor hope remaines, And after me, let none whom greatnesse shrouds, Trust tumid titles, nor ostentive shows: âSailes swolne with windes, whil'st emulating clouds, That which puffes up, oft at the last o're-throws. O! had this pretious wit enrich'd my minde, Which by experience I have dearly bought, Whil'st fortune was within my Court confin'd, And that I could not thinke a bitter thought; Then satisfi'd with Soveraignty ear'st prov'd, I had disdain'd new dangers to embrace, And cloath'd with majestie, admir'd, and lov'd, Had liv'd with pleasure, and had dy'd in peace. âBut what more wonderfull in any State, âThen power (when courted) that is free from pride? âBut chiefly those who live securely great, âThey oft may erre, since Fortune is their guide, What could the world afford, or man affect, Which did not smooth my soule, whil'st I was such? Whom now the changing world doth quite neglect, By prospr'ing plagu'd, starv'd onely with too much; Long lull'd asleep with scornfull Fortunes lyes, A slave to pleasure, drown'd in base delights, I made a covenant with my wandring eyes, To entertaine them still with pleasant sights; My heart enjoy'd all that was wish'd of late, Whil'st it the height of happinesse did cloy, Still serv'd with dainty, but suspected meat, My soule with pleasure sicke, was faint for joy; All, with much care what might procure mine ease: (My will divin'd) obsequiously devis'd, And who my fancy any way could please, As prais'd by me, was by all others pris'd. Save serving me none else could have deserv'd, Of whom what ever came, was held of weight, My words and looks were carefully observ'd, And whom I grac'd, were had in honour straight; For pompe and pow'r, farre passing other Kings, Whil'st too secure with drowsie thoughts I slumbred, My coffers still were full of pretious things, Of which (as wealth least weigh'd) gold scarce was numbred; I rear'd rare buildings, all embost with gold; Made ponds for fishes, forrests for wilde beasts; And with vain thoughts which could not be controll'd, Oft spent the day in sport, the night in feasts. I toss'd the Elements with power like Ioves, Driv'd water up, aire downe, a pleasant change: For, stately fountains, artificiall groves, As common things were not accounted strange. With me (what more could any Monarch crave?) In all the parts of pompe, none could compare: My Minions gallant, Counsellours were grave, My guards were strong, my Concubines were faire; Yea, whil'st light Fortune my defects supply'd, I had all that could breed (as now I finde) In others wonder, in the owner pride, So puffing up the flesh to spoyle the minde. Thus with delight (long pressing pleasures grapes) With Fortune I carrows'd what men deare hold, But ah! from misery none alwayes scapes, âOne must be wretched once, or yong, or old; Then weary to be well, and tyr'd of rest, To waken trouble, I th'occasion sought; And yet to cloake the passions of my brest, Did with devotion long cloud what I thought: Of all the Oracles I did enquire What was to come of this intended warre, Who said (as seem'd to second my desire) That I a mightie Monarchie should marre. Those doubtfull words I wresting to my will, In hope to breake the hauty Persians pow'rs, Did ruine quite (whil'st all succeeded ill) What many a age had gain'd, even in few houres; And this may be admir'd as more then strange, I who disdain'd an equall of before, (What cannot Fortune do, when bent to change?) Then servants lesse, must dreame content no more; What eye not bigge with scorne my state surveyes, Whom all do pittie now; or worse, do blame, And bound even to my foe for some few dayes, Which borrowed are with th'intrest of my fame. Though this sweet gale of life-bestowing windes Would seeme a favour (so it seemes to some) Who by the basenesse of their muddie mindes Shew from what vulgar stock their kinde doth come; I scorne unlike my selfe thus to be seene, Though to my comfort this appear'd to tend, As if misfortunes past had onely beene A Tragick entry to a Comick end. Of all that plague my State, what greater pest Then servile life, which faints from th'earth to part? And hath in one united all the rest To make me dye each day, yet live to smart; Life in my brest no comfort can infuse: âAn En'mies gift could never come for good, It but gives time of misery to muse, And bathe my sorrows in a bitter flood: Ah! had my breath straight vanish'd with my blisse, And clos'd the windows that gave light to life, I had not borne (to misery submisse) The height of those mishaps, which now are rife: Whil'st with a thousand sighs I call to minde The death of Atis, and mine owne disgrace, In such an agony my soule I finde, That life to death would willingly give place; But since I see reserv'd for further spight, I with sad thoughts must burden yet my soule, My memory to my distracted spright Of all my troubles shall present a scroule, Of which, while as th'accounts I go to cast, When numbring my misfortunes all of late, I will looke backe upon my pleasures past, And by them ballance my (now) haplesse stare. Chorus. âIs't not a wonder thus to see âHow by experience each man reeds âIn practis'd volumes penn'd by deeds, âHow things below inconstant be; âYet whil'st our selves continue free, âWe ponder oft, but not apply âThat pretious oyle, which we might buy, âBest with the price of others paines, âWhich (as what not to us pertaines) âTo use we will not condescend, âAs if we might the fates defie, âStill whilst untouch'd our state remaines; âBut soon the heavens a change may send. âNo perfect blisse before the end. When first we fill with fruitfull seed, The apt conceiving wombe of th' earth, And seeme to banish feare of dearth, With that which it by time may breed, Still dangers doe our hopes exceed: The frosts may first with cold confound The tender greenes which decke the ground, Whose wrath though Aprils smiles asswage, It must abide th' Eolian rage, Which too o're-com'd, whilst we attend All Ceres wandring tresses bound, The reines let from their cloudy cage May spoile what we expect to spend: No perfect blisse before the end. Lee, whil'st the Vine-tree great with Grapes, With nectar'd liquor strives to kisse Embracing Elmes not lov'd amisse, Those clusters lose their comely shapes, Whilst by the thunder burn'd, in heapes All Bacchus hopes fall downe and perish Thus many things doe fairely flourish, Which no perfection can attaine, And yet we worldlings are so vaine, That our conceits too high we bend, If fortune but our Spring-time cherish, Though divers stormes we must sustaine, To harvest ere our yeares ascend: No perfect blisse before the end. By all who in this world have place, There is a course which must be runne, And let none thinke that he hath wonne, Till first he finish'd hath his race; The Forrests through the which we trace, Breed ravenous beasts, which doe abhorre us, And lye in wait still to devoure us, Whil'st brambles doe our steppes beguile, The feare of which though we exile, And to our marke with gladnesse tend, Then balles of gold are laid before us, To entertaine our thoughts a while, And our good meaning to suspend: No perfect blisse before the end. Behold how CrÅsus long hath liv'd, Throughout this spatious world admir'd, And having all that he desir'd, A thousand meanes of joy contriv'd; Yes suddenly is now depriv'd Of all that wealth; and strangely falles: For every thing his sprite appalles, His sonnes decease, his countryes losse, And his owne state, which stormes doe tosse: Thus he who could not apprehend, Then whil'st he slept in marble walles, No, nor imagine any crosse, To beare all those his brest must lend: No perfect blisse before the end. And we the Lydians who design'd To raigne over all who were about us, Behold how fortune too doth flout us, And utterly hath us resign'd; For, to our selves we that assign'd A Monarchie, but knew not how, Yet thought to make the world to bow, Which at our forces stood afraid, We, we by whom these plots were laid, To thinke of bondage must descend, And beare the yoke of others now; O, it is true that Solon said! While as he yet doth breath extend, No man is blest; behold the end. FINIS.</field>
