      <field name="fulltext">THE TRIUMPHS OF LOVE and HONOUR, A PLAY,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO Her Grace The Dutchess of DEVONSHIRE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The PROLOGUE, Written by Sir Robert Henley, Bart. And spoke by Mr WILLIAM MILLS. The tragic Muse, full twice a thousand Years, In the big Scene has rais'd our Hopes and Fears; By unexpected Turns she gives Surprise; Now Joy she gives, then fills with Tears the Eyes; A War of Passions in their Breasts they feel, As the Muse fires, who have not Hearts of Steel. Old Ãschylus, in tragic Numbers bold, The Griefs of Mortals, and Immortals, told; He, leaving Nature and terrestrial Plains, Sung Jove's Revenge, and bound the Gods in Chains. Next Sophocles, majestic in his Rage, To Admiration charms a knowing Age; In all the Pomp of Words He greatly sings The Wreck of Empires, and the Woes of Kings. Euripides, sententious and serene, Bright, tho not blazing, grac'd the tragic Scene. Proud Rome, that gather'd of old Greece the Store, Compar'd with her, in Tragedy was poor; In Nero's Reign the moralizing Sage Drew but faint Copys of the Greecian Page. To these succeeds a Race of monkish Days, In which no learned Brow was crown'd with Bays; One dismal Cent'ry to another yields; No Sound is hear'd but the loud Clash of shields. Huns, Goths, and Vandals, from the northern Clime, Swarm o'er the Earth, and fright the Land of Rhyme: Mute are the Nine; Virtue and Learning sleep, While War and Zeal their wakeful Vigils keep. At length the tragic Muse again appears, And gives the Promise of successful Years; Britain and France the sacred Influence feel From Shakespeare, Fletcher, and the great Corneille. Their bright Examples other Bards inspire, And to the Road of Fame their Bosoms fire: In Virtue's Cause the Sons of Verse engage, And most instructing most they charm the Age. This Night our Bard the glorious Tract pursues; New to the Stage he courts the tragic Muse; By an invented Tale, a Tale of Love, Without the Guilt of Blood he strives to move; To their own Peace he shews the Parents blind, Who disunite the Hearts which Love has join'd; With Candour he intreats ye to attend, And begs no Favour but as Virtue's Friend.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Scene the Palace of Aristarchus. Enter Aristarchus, Philocles, Philander, Dion, and Attendants: Aristarchus places himself on his Throne, Philander standing at one Side, and Philocles at the other. A Symphony of war-like Music is performed as they enter. Aristarchus. Thrice has the morning Sun beheld the Foe Bidding Defyance fierce to Cyprian Arms, And threat'ning Ruin, 'e're the Noon of Day, To this our fruitful Isle; Philander thrice Repell'd the bold Intruders from the Land, And drove them to the Waves; we saw their Sails Courting the Winds to bear them from our Rage. Accept, thou brave young Man, the humble Thanks Of Royalty; and if our Isle contains Ought worth thy Wish, ask, and 'tis thine. Philander. My Liege, Embolden'd by your Leave, thus on my Knees, I beg a Treasure that my Soul has sought With Pray'rs incessant, and that mutual Vows Have made my own; and when confirm'd by you, The Measure of my Joy will be compleat. Aristarchus. Speak; my Impatience tells me I'm too slow In my Returns to thee: Ingratitude Will be my Curse, if I refuse to grant Whatever you can ask, and I can give. Philander. You have a Daughter whose superior Charms Can draw the Hermit from his peaceful Cell To gaze upon her; whose bright Excellence Can fire to Glory ev'ry manly Breast: E'en while I speak, I feel the sacred Impulse That urg'd me early to the Fields of Blood. Aristarchus. Ah! thou wou'd'st ask what is not mine to give: This Morn, by solemn Contract, I assign'd My dear Urania to the Prince of Rhodes. Philander. His Merits may, perhaps, more strongly plead Than the pass'd Service of my faithful Arm; His future Prowess may, perhaps, enlarge The Empire which my Sword preserv'd from Ruin: Now, Philocles, 'tis thine to blaze in Arms, And drive th' Invaders from the Land of Love. She that gave Courage to Philander's Heart, Strength to his Arm, and fought her Father's Cause By no ignoble Proxy, is no more The Prospect of Delight; no more my Eyes Must gaze desirous on thy Charms, Urania; Thy Father has bestow'd thee on another; Nor have I left, the Wretch's Portion, Hope. O! Aristarchus, for the Fair I bled, For her rush'd on where most the Danger lay, Resolv'd on Conquest, or a glorious Fall: My Pride, O! King, was to reward her Love With high Renown, that she might justly boast She took no vulgar Hero to her Arms; And if I fell, with Pleasure I foresaw The lovely Maid, your lov'd Urania, wou'd Bedew my Ashes with the Tears of Love. Aristarchus. Then to my Daughter did I owe thy Service? Philander. Yes, most to her; and happy is that Prince Whose Leader's Motive to the War is Love. When Beauty bids th' enamour'd Hero fly To gather Honours on the martial Plain, The bright Idea he preserves in View, And scours with double Force the Scenes of Death: His Valour then encreases with his Love, And Cupid triumphs in the Field of Mars. [Philocles approaches Philander, and speaks. Soldier, thy Deeds want not the Boast of Words To blaze thy Fame; this Truth a Rival owns, Who pants to rival thee in Feats of Arms Well as in Love: O! bear me to the Scenes Where the brave fall, and Death in Ambush lys; There Philocles shall strive to be the foremost, If Beauty is the Prize, or Virtue calls. [Aristarchus comes from his Throne, and speaks to Philander. Think not, young Warrior, that I rate thy Deeds Beneath their Merits: to thy Arm I owe That I am now a King, and like a King I wou'd reward the Bulwark of my State. Had thy Request been made before this Morn, So much I prize thy Worth, thou'dst been my Son; Blame thy own Silence now, not my Refusal; For as my royal Word this Day was giv'n To Philocles, I must not stain my Fame: I shou'd descend with Sorrow to the Grave, If I was conscious that a Man surviv'd To charge my Memory with Wrongs sustain'd From Aristarchus. Philocles, the Maid Is thine by Contract; may the Hand of Heav'n Be always over thee, to guide thy Steps To Acts of Virtue; may thy Wife, my Daughter, To thee be what her Mother was to me, The Blessing of my Days. Philander, ask What is in me to give, ask Half my Realm, I'll give it thee, and be but Half a King. Philander. O! cou'd'st thou, Prince, exert the Pow'r of Gods, And bid me gaze on the blue Vault of Heav'n, And make each Star therein a World of Gold, Then bid those Worlds be mine, an humble Shed In a fair rural Scene, Urania there, Would lay Ambition waste. [Philocles to the King. Remember, Sir, The Hour in which your royal Word to me Must be fulfill'd. The Temple is adorn'd In all the Pomp of Majesty and Love; And the Priest waits to join us. Philander. Let him wait: O! Aristarchus, weigh the mutual Love, That has cemented long the faithful Hearts Of thy Urania, and thy loyal Soldier, Weigh it against the Wealth and Pomp of Rhodes; Then let thy Justice, and paternal Love, Determine thee to pass thy Sentence on me. Aristarchus. My plighted Word is not to be recall'd; And shou'd I forfeit that, my Age wou'd wear What in my Youth I shun'd, Disgrace; in that The Dignity of Kings wou'd suffer. Philocles. Sir, By my Impatience judge my Love; no more Descend, by Reason, to convince the Man Whom by a Word you may command to Duty. Philander. Patience no more is Virtue; here I'll fall, Or with my Sword I will oppose thy Way To Joys which Nature never mean'd for thee. [Philander and Philocles draw their Swords; Aristarchus interposes, and speaks. This Violence committed to my Face Deserves a Term severer than I'll give it, And a Rebuke, young Man, thou shalt not have. On your Allegiance, Dion, I require, As you're my Subject, and Philander's Friend, That you will guard him well: to thee I trust That my pacific Roof be not disturb'd By that young Brawler in the Gust of Love, While we attend the HymenÃ¦al Rites; When they're perform'd your Charge is over: then We shall expect you to partake the Joys Of the gay Festival, to crown the Night With honest Mirth, and hail the wedded Pair To the bless'd State of Union, State of Love. Rash, inconsid'rate Youth, after this Hour, Tho my Heart grieves that I must drive thee hence, No more within my palace Walls be seen: Be thy Estate thy Bounds, and there remain Till thou hast hear'd from me. Now, Prince of Rhodes, I wait thy Nuptials. [Aristarchus, Philocles, and Attendants, go. SCENE II. Philander. Dion, see thy Friend, Like the firm Cedar that defys the Rage Of Wind and Rains, but by the Fires of Heav'n Is forc'd to yield his noble Trunc to Ruin: Behold, and pity, me. Dion. Yet, cherish Hope. Philander. Alas! that Comfort is deny'd to me: A restless Exile to the Plains I'll go, And wait the Day that shall conclude my Sorrows. Go, Dion, shine beneath the royal Smile, And leave thy Friend abandon'd to his Griefs, Who to the neighb'ring Hills shall make his Moan, And now and then admit a Glimps of Joy To steal upon his Soul, when he reflects On the fair Fortune that attends thy Worth. Haste to the Festival, where Beauty sits To heighten ev'ry Joy. Haste, shun an Exile; This Brawler shall not interrupt their Peace; He will not, Dion, heap the King's Displeasure On thee for a Neglect of Duty; no, My Soul now sickens; and I feel the Hand Of dire Affliction on me, that divests My Breast of all my Strength, and tells my Heart His fairest Guest is fled, is lost, for ever. Dion. When I forsake thee, may the good Man's Blessing, His greatest Comfort in the Day of Sadness, The Consciousness of having pass'd his Time Blameless in Reason's Eye, forsake me quite. In War, or Exile, I am still your Friend; Nor will I leave you for the Smiles of Courts. Alas! Philander, thou can'st not conceive What Pains I suffer when I see the Man, My other self, whose noble Spirit press'd him Foremost to front the boldest Sons of War, Drooping beneath a disappointed Love. Philander. True, thou hast seen me in the Hours of Blood, Unshock'd amidst the various Forms of Death; Yet, I must own, this unexpected Blow Has quite subdu'd me. Lo! Thalia comes; I will not stay to wreck her tender Soul With the Recital of her Brother's Woes: O! tell her, Dion, that I bear my Pains As a Man shou'd: say what thou canst to ease her. Now I obey thee, King: O! Court, farewel, Thou base Seducer of ambitious Youth: Welcome, Ritirement sweet, where ev'ry Hill Shall witness to my unsuccessful Love, While thou, my Friend, the Inmate of my Heart, Shalt sooth Affliction, and expel Despair. [After going some few Steps he returns. This I'd forgot: charge her to tell Urania, That, while she fills my happyer Rival's Arms, I'd have her cast into Oblivion all Our Vows of mutual Love, lest the Rememb'rance Shou'd prove destructive to her rising Joys. Dion. But few the Moments which divide me from thee. [Philander goes. SCENE III. Thalia enters. Thalia. For what Offence, say, for what Crime unknown, Philander flys me? Are my fond Desires To ease his Sorrows, or to share his Griefs, Rewarded thus? Soon as the King's Commands Were rumour'd to me, eager to perform The Duty of a Sister and a Friend, I hasten'd hither; and at my Approach Unkind he fled. Dion. Nor Hatred, nor Neglect, Forc'd him to shun thee, but a just Concern, Such as those know who feel what others feel; Judge from his Words: Thalia comes, he cry'd; I will not stay to wreck her tender Soul With the Recital of her Brother's Woes. Thalia. And cou'dst thou, Dion, let Philander go A lonely Exile to the gloomy Shades, Where Melancholy reigns, where sad Reflection Shall prey uninterrupted on his Mind? Dion. Reproach me not, my Fair; to Love and Friendship I give this Moment; by his own Request I here attend thee: he intreats, by me, That you will charge Urania not to throw One Thought away on him. Thalia. That Charge is vain; For when her Father press'd her to the Temple, Sighing she cry'd Philander is not there. Dion. Ill-fated Virgin! and unjust Decree! O! my Thalia, we must now conspire To drive the Pains of disappointed Love From our Philander's Breast; a Friend and Sister May prove Physicians to his troubled Mind. Haste, my Thalia, to the Solitude, Where Innocence and Love secure may rest; Where I'll forget that e'er I shin'd in Arms; Where ev'ry Hour shall be employ'd for thee, To find new Ways to please: thy Brother there, No longer kept a Stranger to our Passion, Shall join our Hands, and bid our Hearts rejoice In our successful and our virtuous Love. Thalia. Haste to the Scene, where thou shalt quickly meet The Maid who gave her virgin Heart to thee; And whose first Pride is that she chose so well. Tho my Soul ill can brook the short Delay, Yet some Regard is due to poor Urania, My true, my royal, Friend; who, now distracted Betwixt the Tys of Duty and of Love, Wants a kind helping Hand: when I have pay'd The Debt I owe to Friendship and to Virtue, To Courts I'll bid adieu, and hail the Plains, Where Love, where Innocence, securely reigns. Dion. There shall your Smiles, my Fair, relieve your Slave Of all the Torments which your Absence gave. The End of the first ACT.</field>

Enter Shepherds and Shepherdesses, who dance, while another Shepherd addresses himself to a Shepherdess sitting by him on a Bank: after the Dance is over the Shepherd and Shepherdess sing: another Shepherd pipes while they dance and sing. Shepherdess. Take me, O! Damon, take me to thee, I thy Vows no longer shun; Selena in her Turn shall woo thee; Take the Prize thy Virtue won. Shepherd. The Hills which answer'd to the Measure Of my sad, complaining, Song, Shall now return the Notes of Pleasure, Which to Love and thee belong. Shepherdess. When to thy Brows I leave the Willow, And from thee and Honour stray, May from our Isle an angry Billow Wash me as a Stain away. Shepherd. Beauty and Fortune may forsake thee, But thy Damon never can; Nor Age, nor Poverty, can make thee Hateful to thy faithful Man. Shepherdess. May my lov'd Shepherd never languish, Raptur'd for a fairer Maid; For fatal soon wou'd be the Anguish Of Selena once betray'd. Shepherd. With no Ambition, Gods, perplex us; All Contention hence remove; May no dishonest Passion vex us; All our Strife, and Pride, be Love. Chorus of Shepherds and Shepherdesses. With no Ambition, Gods, perplex us; All Contention hence remove; May no dishonest Passion vex us; All our Strife, and Pride, be Love. [The Shepherds and Shepherdesses go, when Philander and Dion appear. SCENE II. Philander and Dion. Philander. How happyer, Dion, are my Vassals here Than is their Lord! They never felt the Pangs Which the ambitious feel, when their proud Hopes Are vanish'd like a morning Dream away; They never, ne'er like me, unwisely left Their Beds of Vi'lets, and their Shades of Lime, For the vain Glory of the Camp or Court. O! righteous Heav'n, you've heap'd Afflictions on me, And I deserve them all: you gave this Wretch A goodly Heritage, a Land of Plenty, That pays the Lab'rer's Toil, who smiling comes, And gives his first and fairest Fruits to me; Yet I ingrateful left the Scene of Bliss To range about the World and gather Woe. Dion. Cease your Complaints, and, as a brave Man shou'd, Bear your Misfortunes with an equal Mind. You know not what is in the Womb of Time Reserv'd for you. Philander. Urania's lost to me; And that's a Loss which Time cannot repair: That is the poyson'd Arrow which adheres Close to my Heart, and preys upon my Life. Dion. From this bright Eminence, where Nature smiles Untainted by the Luxurys of Art, Philander, cast thine Eyes on yonder Spires, Which proudly rise to speak the Wealth of Cyprus, Cast thine Eyes on them with Contempt and Pity: Beneath those golden Roofs Ambition waits To tempt the heedless Youth; there Falsehood lys, And Envy there, with damn'd Ingratitude. Here Nature with a lavish Hand adorns The Scene with Objects to delight the Eye; Here rising Hills, and here the flow'ry Vales, And silver Brooks, invite to Meditation: Here may the philosophic Soul indulge Her Thirst for Knowledge undisturb'd by Noise; And here, by reas'ning, may the love-sick Mind Find out a Cure. Philander. Indeed you talk, my Friend, Like one that never groan'd beneath the Pangs Of disappointed Love. O! flatt'ring Hope! I once had treasur'd all my Views of Joy In my Urania; still I call her mine, So ready speaks my Tongue the usual Words: In her I center'd ev'ry Wish: I fram'd In my fond Mind no Scheme of future Pleasure, Propos'd no Comfort in my Days to come, Without consulting what I thought wou'd please My dear Urania most: she was the Soul Of ev'ry Act, of ev'ry Wish; and when, Invited by the Mistress of the Feast, I was prepar'd to taste the luscious Banquet, An unkind Hand repell'd me, flung me down Upon Despair, and shatter'd all my Hopes. Perhaps beneath the Roofs we now behold, The Prince of Rhodes is rifling all the Sweets, Which with a thousand thousand Sighs I sought, Which with my Blood thro armed Bands I courted. [A Woman sings near them, but is not seen by them. To me in vain The Suns arise, And deck the Plain With various Dys, While my belov'd's away. Philander. This, Dion, is a wretched Maid, whose Case Is not unlike my own. Whoe'er thou art, Approach me, mournful fair one, and improve This Scene of Lamentation, and Despair. [She sings again. [Woman] Ye Minutes run, Bring on the Hour, That gives my Sun, That has the Pow'r To make the Midnight Day. Philander. Again, thou charming Minister of Sorrow! This is a rich Repast for wretched Lovers. [She sings again. [Woman] To me in vain The Suns arise, And deck the Plain With various Dys, While my belov'd's away. Philander. 'Tis she, 'tis she, or a Delusion sent To mock my Griefs, and to compleat my Ruin! [He runs out, and Dion follows him. SCENE III. Urania and Thalia enter, both dressed like Shepherdesses, Urania singing as she goes forwards. Which-way-e'er I turn my Eyes, Lo! the gilded Prospects rise; Flow'rs the Hills and Vales adorning, Giving Fragrance to the Morning, Music warbling from the Mountains, And the sweetly murm'ring Fountains, All delighting, All inviting, Here to feast the ravish'd Senses. SCENE IV. Philander and Dion enter. Philander. The Voice of my belov'd, but not the Form! Urania. But in vain the Prospects rise To my sadly weeping Eyes, Till Philander comes to chear me; All is Bliss when he is near me; He can make the warbling Mountains, And the sweetly murm'ring Fountains, All delighting, All inviting; He alone true Joy dispenses. [Philander hastens to her, and embraces her; and while they are speaking Dion addresses himself to Thalia. Philander. Thou Wonder of thy Sex, Life of my Life, Speak, answer me, for my Heart pants to know, By what supprising Chance I see thee here? Urania. A Flood of Joy breaks in upon my Soul, Too strong for me to bear. Thalia speak; Inform thy Brother how I shun'd the Snare Lay'd for my virgin Heart. Philander. My Sister too! Welcome thou friendly Maid! O! quickly tell me To what I owe that I am now redeem'd, From all the Miserys of black Despair, To Joys unspeakable? Thalia. Soon as the Priest Began the nuptial Rites, Urania droop'd Like a fair Flow'r beneath a Storm; the Blood Forsak'd her Cheeks: Life seem'd a-while retir'd; And all was suddenly one Face of Sadness. No Care was wanted, and no Art untry'd, To bring her to herself: to me the King Committed her in Trust, and cry'd the Hand That saves my Child from Death preserves my Age From Woes incurable: before the Morn Arose to glad the Swains, we fled from Court, Attir'd as you behold. Philander. O! my Urania, I gaze upon thee like a Wretch exil'd From the fair Mansions of eternal Bliss, Shut out from Day to blackest Scenes of Horror, And in an unexpected Moment call'd Again to revel in the Fields of Light: A fairer Prospect meets his ravish'd Eyes Than he before beheld; each Beauty seems Doubly improv'd, and dazzles ev'ry Sense. [Dion, holding the Hand of Thalia. Amidst the Joys which now surround my Friend, Dion with great Humility prefers This one Request. Long has this heav'nly Maid, Press'd by repeated Vows of Love from me, Plighted her virgin Heart; my Friend's Consent Alone is wanted to compleat our Joy. Philander. You ask no more than I rejoice to give. Dion. Bless'd be the Hour that to your Eyes restores The Object of your Wishes, who alone Can reconcile you to yourself, and make Life worth preserving, bless'd the Voice that gave A Sanction to my Love. Thalia, now The Glory of the Camp, and Pomp of Courts, Cease to allure me; all my future Pride Shall be to wear out Life in pleasing thee. Thalia. And all my Days to come shall be employ'd In striving, Dion, to deserve thy Love. Philander. Still, my divine Urania, I've my Fears; Methinks I now behold the aged King Extravagant in Grief; and soon perhaps Thou may'st again be torn from thy Philander. So often, Dion, I have try'd thy Friendship, That I despair not of thy kind Assistance In what I ask of thee. While I remain In this Retirement with thy lov'd Thalia, And with the Fair whose Presence gives me Life, Return to Court, and there awhile reside, That your Intelligence from thence may aid us. Dion. I go, and may th' Event not cross our Wishes. [Dion goes. SCENE V. Philander. My lov'd Urania, ever constant Fair, Whose Presence wou'd adorn the Desart wild, Since you have grac'd these Plains, and bless'd my Eyes With thy dear Form, the Lilly fairer blooms, The Rose now blushes with a lovelyer Red, And a more chearful Verdure glads the Sight; The gentle Gales with richer Odours fly To feast the Scent; from ev'ry Hill and Vale, From ev'ry Grove, a sweeter Melody Dys on the ravish'd Ear: the Soul, before Employ'd in grieving for an absent Love, Senseless to all that courted her to Pleasure, Exults, and grows luxurious in Delight. Urania. Now mutual is our Joy: e'en Paradise, Where all Things fairer bloom, as Sages say, Without Philander, cou'd afford no Bliss. Philander. Was I, Urania, doom'd from thee to stay, Tho in Elysium's fairest, sweetest, Bow'rs, Each Hour to me wou'd seem a tedious Day; And with thee Ages I shou'd count but Hours. The End of the second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shepherdess. Take me, O! Damon, take me to thee, I thy Vows no longer shun; Selena in her Turn shall woo thee; Take the Prize thy Virtue won. Shepherd. The Hills which answer'd to the Measure Of my sad, complaining, Song, Shall now return the Notes of Pleasure, Which to Love and thee belong. Shepherdess. When to thy Brows I leave the Willow, And from thee and Honour stray, May from our Isle an angry Billow Wash me as a Stain away. Shepherd. Beauty and Fortune may forsake thee, But thy Damon never can; Nor Age, nor Poverty, can make thee Hateful to thy faithful Man. Shepherdess. May my lov'd Shepherd never languish, Raptur'd for a fairer Maid; For fatal soon wou'd be the Anguish Of Selena once betray'd. Shepherd. With no Ambition, Gods, perplex us; All Contention hence remove; May no dishonest Passion vex us; All our Strife, and Pride, be Love. Chorus of Shepherds and Shepherdesses. With no Ambition, Gods, perplex us; All Contention hence remove; May no dishonest Passion vex us; All our Strife, and Pride, be Love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Scene the Palace of Aristarchus. Philocles and Dion. Yes, Dion, I beheld the royal Maid With Adoration; all my Thoughts by Day, And all my Dreams by Night, were of Urania; Th' Ideas of my Soul were all confin'd To her; her ev'ry Gesture, ev'ry Word, Enrich'd my Mind with Images of Love. Dion. The more you lov'd the brighter shines your Glory: Who but a Prince with ev'ry Virtue crown'd Cou'd act like you? That Title which you claim'd, From a King's Promise, from a Parent's Word, You greatly have resign'd, and forc'd your Tongue To plead Philander's Cause. Philocles. The good and brave Are always Friends; nor was I e'er his Foe. While I might hope to make Urania mine I stop'd not my Pursuit; but now I find The Cement of their Love so strong, my Joy Shall be to make them happy, and myself Less wretched than I shou'd be, if I striv'd Still to divide them. With this Sigh I give My unsuccessful Passion to the Wind. The Prince of Rhodes, Philander, is thy Friend, And will be foremost, when he meets thee next, To give thee Proofs of his avow'd Esteem. I'd rather, Dion, take the marble Form, To my Embraces, than the living Maid Cold as the Marble to my eager Love. Have you prepar'd to let Philander know How much I prize his Worth, and seek his Ease? Dion. I have; and he's, 'e're now, arriv'd at Court. Behold the mournful Majesty of Cyprus: In solemn Sadness comes the aged King, With Grief depress'd, yet aweful in his Sorrows. SCENE II. Aristarchus enters with Attendants. Aristarchus. If she is lost, the Idol of my Eyes, The richest Jewel that adorn'd my Crown, If she is lost, within my Walls no more Be hear'd the Voice of Joy; henceforth may Peace Forsake my Dwelling: let these hoary Locks Henceforth be circled with a Crown of Thorns, This purple Robe, the Badge of Royalty, Be chang'd to Sackcloth. Till my Child returns Nightly the marble Floor shall catch my Tears, This aged Body shall no more enjoy A gentle slumber on the Bed of Down. Philocles. Be patient, Sir, the Hand of sad Affliction May soon withdraw, and the lost Maid may come To bless your Age with greater Happyness Than ever yet you tasted. Aristarchus. Wou'd she come, And was Philander but an humble Slave, He shou'd receive her to his longing Arms. [Philocles aside to Dion. Haste, Dion, to relieve the wretched King, And wipe the Tears from weeping Majesty. [Dion goes. SCENE III. Philocles. Let not the Majesty of Cyprus droop While you have Room for Hope: your faithful Slaves, Obsequious to your Will, are now employ'd In searching out the Fair; nor has my Care, As soon perhaps th' Event may witness for me, Been wanted to restore that Peace of Mind, Which you enjoy'd while your Urania smil'd Beneath your Eye, and charm'd the Heart of Age. Aristarchus. O! Philocles, perhaps the love-sick Maid, The darling of my Soul, now frantic roves Over the desart Heath, her Tresses loose, And talks romantic to the whistling Winds! E'en now perhaps she loads my Age with Curses, Or is perhaps no more: support me, Prince. [He leans on Philocles. SCENE IV. Enter Philander, Dion, Urania, and Thalia. Philocles. Welcome, Philander, to the Court, and me; May all our Meetings give you Joy like this. Lift up your Eyes, great Sir, and see the fairest, The purest, Work of the creating Hand; Behold your own Urania. Aristarchus. Bless the Tongue That nam'd Urania, who alone can raise Desire of Life in my declining Age. [Urania goes towards the King, and kneels. If, royal Sir, you can forgive a Maid, That left a Court, my Father, and my King, To be Companion to an exil'd Man, Pour down your Grace on me: that I repent I cannot say, or if I shou'd, that Word Wou'd sink the Merit of my Love; a Love, Which nor the Baits of Empire, nor the Frowns Of Majesty, a Parent, nor of Fortune, Nor any Pow'r, except the Foe of Life, Can drive from my sincere, afflicted, Heart; A Heart too fix'd, too faithful, to admit A Rival to Philander. Aristarchus. Rise, my Child, And be uninterrupted Joy your Dow'r. Here, with this Kiss, which a fond Parent gives, I freely grant thee Privilege to ask All that the Fondness of thy Soul can wish; Which I will answer, to my Stretch of Pow'r, With all th' Indulgence of a tender Father. Urania. My late Offence, I cannot say my Crime, May tell my royal Father what Request Is nearest to my Heart: why did I fly The Court and you, but for Philander's Love? Aristarchus. O! had I known thee safe beneath the Care Of thy belov'd, Affliction had not layed Her Hand so heavy on me: my fond Fears Fram'd the sad Image of my Age's Darling Roving regardless of herself, no Guide But her own Frenzy, and uncertain Chance: Now I have found thee, I with Joy bequeath thee Another's Right thro Life. Philander, take her, And, in bestowing her, think that I give thee What's dearer to me than my Crown. Thou know'st My strict Attachment to my royal Word, Plighted to Philocles, was the sole Cause Of our late short, but tedious, Separation: Be that forgot; and let one Face of Joy Now thro our Isle be seen. The Prince of Rhodes, Gen'rous as royal, has subdu'd his Heart, And pleaded for his Rival. Now, my Son, With a glad Mind, and an unbroken Vow, I give her to thee: be your Hours of Joy According to your Virtues. Philander. Royal Sir, Words cannot well express the Worth supreme Of the fair Gift; and since they can not speak My Sense of Gratitude, my Actions shall: To her Desires I will devote my Days, And by my future Deeds approve myself A loyal Subject, and a duteous Son. Forgive me, Philocles, thou bright Example Of princely Virtue, my too long Delay Of rend'ring Thanks for thy Benevolence. Prince, from this Hour you may command my Sword; To you my Heart's in sacred Friendship join'd, And Gratitude's my Bond, which Death alone Shall cancel from my Heart. Philocles. My Fate deny'd That I shou'd be successful in my Love, But, in Exchange, has bless'd me with a Friend, Whose Virtues will adorn the great Allyance. Urania, fruitful be your nuptial Bed: You only cou'd deserve the Man, whose Worth Gives him a Title to the lovely'st Maid. When I have seen the marriage Rites fulfill'd, I'll sail to Rhodes, where ev'ry rising Sun Shall witness to my zealous Pray'rs, preferr'd For the Continuance of our mutual Safety. Philander. For which I'll breath my dayly Vows to Heav'n. Now that my Friend may be as bless'd as I am, Dion, receive what your unsully'd Faith, And your brave Soul have merited from me. Thalia, now in giving thee to Dion, I give thee, what thou can'st not prize too much, An honourable Husband. The same Hour, In which the Priest shall join me to Urania, Shall give my much lov'd Sister to my Friend. Dion. All that I beg'd of Heav'n I now receive From you; without your Friendship and her Love The Pomp and Wealth of Empires wou'd but serve To dress Affliction with the Face of Joy. Philander. Urania, heav'nly Fair, from our Example May future Lovers learn to persevere In Constancy and Virtue: tho awhile The Parent may oppose the growing Passion, The kindly Workings of paternal Love, Urg'd by the voice of Reason, plead too strongly To be withstood; or shou'd a Father prove Deaf to the Dictates of th' unerring Guide, Immortal Reason, sad Experience soon Wou'd teach him his Mistake, wou'd load his Age With Woes, the Fruit of his obdurate Heart: This Truth the godlike Aristarchus knows, Who wisely listen'd to the Voice divine, That pointed out the Way to Happyness To us and to himself. Honour and Love Now triumph Hand in Hand; and my fond Heart Bounds raptur'd with Extravagance of Bliss. With Joys unnumber'd are their Moments crown'd, With Virtue whose sincere Affections move; Pleasures, by Vice unsully'd, wait around Where spotless Honour makes the Bed of Love. The END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE, Spoke by Mrs Charke. This Prince of Rhodes, methinks, did not discover The genuine Tokens of a perfect Lover; He seems to me much of the dangling Kind, Such often as at Court, andâ Pointing to those behind the Scenes. here we find. The Dangler is that Species of the Beaus Whose Commendation most is in his Cloaths, Who, of a Lover to obtain the Fame, First on a publick Whisper builds his Name, And, when he 'as dangled thro a tedious Year, Gets full Possessionâof the Lady's Ear; He aims no farther; for a close Caress Wou'd chafe his Skin, and discompose his Dress: He never will, poor Thing, himself betray, Like Lady Grace, who once was hear'd to say The Pettycoat is an improper Place For Bugles: why? Because they scratch'd her Face: A Dangler isâin short, he is a Noâman, That loves himself too well to love a Woman. Give me the Man, (say, Ladys, am I right?) Who, rather than resign the Maid, wou'd fight, Who wou'd, with Sword in Hand, the Fort invade, And shew the Virtues of aâpushing Blade: But hold: what can I of our Princess say, Who seems to love out of the modern Way? She might, to please her Sire, and end all Strife, Have yielded to be made the Prince's Wife; Then of two Arrows to her Bow secure, She shou'd have us'd that most that shot most sure, And might have, when catch'd tripping in her Game, On her hard-hearted Father lay'd the Blame. Our Poet says, perhaps more nice than wise, Such Objects are unfit for virgin Eyes; He, by Example, rather chose to prove That they are happyest who with Honour love. The END.</field>
