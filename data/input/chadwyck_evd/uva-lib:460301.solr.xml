      <field name="fulltext">TO GEORGE COLMAN, Esq; DEAR SIR, I can never forget the time, when our literary amusements were so intimately blended, that we seemed to have one invention, one sentiment, one expression. The regularity of a periodical publication led us to a constant intercourse and communication of ideas: and whatever may be the fate of this present undertaking, I shall never regret my having dipt in ink, since it gave me an opportunity of cultivating a social as well as literary connection with you. Instead of prefixing your name to this work, with the distant air of a dedication, I wished to have had it coupled along with mine in the title-page: I wanted you as a comes jucundus, an agreeable companion, in this new unbeaten track of translation, which you have so happily struck out before me. It is therefore in some measure your own fault, if the present attempt should fail of success; and the publick, I fear, as well as myself, will have too much reason to regret your not joining with me. I, however, heartily excuse you, as you continue to turn your thoughts to original composition. I own, indeed, I shall feel a more than ordinary disappointment, if I should be judged unworthy to rank with you in this humbler branch of literature: for I confess, in the pride of my heart, that one great inducement to my engaging in this task was the hope, that our names would be mentioned together as the translators of Terence and Plautus, though I cannot aspire to an equal share of reputation with the author of the Jealous Wife, or the joint authors of the Clandestine Marriage. I am, Dear SIR, Your most affectionate Humble Servant, BONNELL THORNTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. I have been induced to publish these two volumes of my intended translation of the whole of Plautus's comedies, in order to try how far such an attempt may meet with approbation. The success of Mr. Colman's Terence led me to hope, that I could introduce Plautus to public notice in the same agreeable form and manner; and I was the more encouraged to the attempt, by Mr. Colman's readily offering to forward me with one play, which was at once a proof of his regard and good opinion. In consequence of my having advertised this design, I had a still further incitement to proceed in it; as a gentleman, to whom I was then a stranger, was pleased to decline all thoughts, which he had before conceived, of prosecuting the same intention. To him I am indebted for his assistance in one play, as well as for communicating to me whatever he thought might be of service in the undertaking, with that heartiness which endears him to all who have the happiness of being acquainted with him. The same gentleman also took upon himself the trouble of translating the life of our author from Petrus Crinitus. I have purposely avoided following the arrangement of our author's plays, which is alphabetical in the editions of the original, because I found, by observing that order, I should tye myself up to the unnecessary task of translating on, just as the book directed me; though the choice I have made has been purely accidental, without any immediate regard to the particular merit of each play. For this reason the reader must not expect to find, in the volumes now presented him, a select collection or chef d'œuvres of our author's works: the learned reader will be sensible, that as many, if not more, which are equally admired, among our author's twenty plays, are to follow; and it is intended to complete the whole with all possible expedition, if the design should happen to meet with the approbation of the publick. As for the notes, they would perhaps have been fuller, with respect to the conduct of our author as a dramatic writer, if I had not intended a particular dissertation on that point, but which cannot with propriety appear, till the whole of the translation is completed. I shall then examine into the respective merits of our author and Terence, between whom there is not perhaps so much difference, but that we may apply to them the words of Terence, in his prologue to the Andrian. Qui utramvis rectè nôrit ambas noverit: Non ita dissimili sunt argumento, sed tamen Dissimili oratione sunt factæ ac stilo. Know one, and you know both; in argument Less different than in sentiment and stile. Colman. I have thought it necessary, for the satisfaction of the less learned reader, to add some notes, which those who are conversant in the ancient writings might deem superfluous; and though I do not mean directly to write for schools, I have had them in my view, where I have quoted some peculiar or remarkable expression or passage of my original; and sometimes I have done it in order to justify me to the learned reader in the use of some common expression or phrase in our own tongue. I have followed no particular edition of our author; but where there have been various readings, I have always prefer'd that which seemed to me the most simple and least forced. It is true, indeed, there are some passages, the sense of which it is hardly possible to determine, and of which we may almost say with our author in his Pœnulus, or Carthaginian, Isti quidem herclè orationi Oedipo Opus conjectore est, Sphyngi qui interpres fuit: If in these I should happen to be mistaken, I can only plead in excuse, that I find the commentators as much puzzled as myself; and I cannot help frequently crying out, after having consulted them, Incertior sum multò quàm dudum. Ter. Phorm. I'm more uncertain Now than I was before. Colman. I flatter myself, that a translation of Plautus may be acceptable at least to the English reader, as he has never appeared entire in our tongue. Echard, indeed, has given us a translation of the three plays, which had been selected by Madam Dacier. Cooke published proposals for a complete translation of our author, and has printed one play, the Amphitryon, in Latin and English. There is likewise an old translation of the Menæchmi of our author, by W. W. printed in 1595, in the collection of Mr. Garrick, of which I shall take further notice, when I come to that play. These are in prose; and how little soever I may appear to go beyond them in other points, I have at least one considerable advantage over them, from the new and elegant mode of translation in familiar blank verse, which Mr. Colman so happily hit upon in his Terence; the propriety and use of which he has so fully set forth in his preface to that work, as makes it needless for me to say any thing here concerning it. As I profess to give nothing more than a translation of my author, it is necessary to mention some peculiarities in his manner, which may appear strange to the English reader. Those who can read and relish him in the original, will be sensible how much these peculiarities are against the translator, who, while he is obliged to be faithful to his author, is obliged likewise to take upon himself in some measure his author's faults. But that I may not be thought to palliate or exaggerate these his seeming defects, I shall extract part of what is said on this point by M. Gueudeville, in his preface to a translation of our author's plays. “Plautus, (says he) like all great men, is not without his exceptions. He has an unbounded inclination to moralizing on every thing in his way. An affectation perhaps of knowing every thing, and of making a parade of that knowledge, often leads him into such perplexity and obscurity in his reflections, as have baffled the pains and endeavours of his commentators to make them intelligible. “Neither is his propensity to the equivoque less pardonable:—he is often playing upon words; but in a manner so low and insipid, that good taste is surfeited even to nauseating. One of these must have been the case; either the old Romans were a set of such jolly fellows, that a little would make them laugh, or else our author had as much of the low as of the high in his judgment . . . “Is not our author also censurable for his indecencies? In my opinion he can in this be no otherwise excused, than by supposing that in so doing he conformed himself to the unpolished taste of the age he lived in. It is probable, that the Romans were not then arrived at elegance in point of delicacy: much less polite than they became afterwards, their ears with pleasure attended to indecent expressions and immodest words . . . “Another fault of our author is, that he abounds in tautology and needless repetitions. His thoughts are often like flowers hid under a multiplicity of weeds: they are like fruit, which the quantity of surrounding leaves obscures the beauty of. Too liable to repeat the same phrase and the same word, one might say he liked the produce of his thoughts too well not to give it more than once; or he imagined his readers and his audience had too limited a discernment to understand them at once . . . “But what gives me the most concern is the little regard he has to probability. Instead of measuring the time by the duration of the action which ought to fill it up, he is thinking of nothing but the action itself, and often supposes things to be done, the execution of which necessarily demands a long space of time. A person goes to the market-place, does his business, and returns again in a minute or two; another, in as short a space of time, marches over a whole town to find his man. Twenty other examples of this kind might be produced . . . “But in the article of probability there is one instance extremely disagreeable. On the stage you see messengers of good news; they usually come from the port; they run quite out of breath to declare the arrival of a father, an husband, or a son of those who are in expectation of them with the utmost impatience. And what do these Mercuries, when they are talking of the haste they are in? 'Tis pleasant to think of it:—they bawl out, that every one should make room for them; they tell you frankly, they will knock down every impertinent fellow that shall be rash enough to obstruct them in their passage; . . . yet these very messengers, that quake for fear lest they should not arrive in time, give themselves leisure to review all that come in their way . . . “Another defect I pass over, which is, confounding the representation with the action. The actor sometimes speaks in his own person and in character at the same time: in the middle of the speech he tells you, that he is not what he appears to be; joining his own personal qualifications with his part, and with the character he is personating” . . . Thus far M. Gueudeville, who, however, concludes with saying, that “all the shades of Plautus do not cloud over the brightness of his sunshine: all his irregularities cast no veil on his original beauties.” To the above it may be proper to add, for the information of the English reader, another circumstance, which may seem strange to him, on account of the difference between the antient and modern stages.—“Some (says Echard in his preface to Terence, as quoted by Mr. Colman) object, that in the beginning of many scenes two actors enter the stage, and talk to themselves a considerable time, before they see or know one another; which, say they, is neither probable nor natural. They, that object this, do not consider the difference between our small scanty stage, and the large magnificent Roman theatres: their stage was sixty yards wide in front; their scenes so many streets meeting together, with by-lanes, rows, and allies; so that two actors coming down two distinct streets or lanes, could not be seen by each other, though the spectators might see both; and sometimes, if they did see each other, they could not well distinguish faces at sixty yards distance. Besides, on several accounts, it might well be supposed, when an actor enters on the stage, out of some house, he might take a turn or two under the porticoes, usual at that time, about his door, and not observe another actor on the other side of the stage.”—These observations, relative to Terence, are no less necessary to be remembered with respect to our author; and I cannot too much caution the modern reader constantly to bear in mind the extent and scenical decoration of the antient stage. Without this it will be impossible to reconcile many particulars, that continually occur, to any kind of probability. Having already declared, that I profess to give nothing more than a direct translation of my author, I shall only add, that the English reader will not, I hope, be displeased at my adhering so strictly to the sense of the original with respect to those customs, manners, ceremonies, &amp;c. which differ from the modern. In other respects, universal nature is and has been so much the same in all ages and countries, that the characters, dispositions, and passions of men, as set forth by our author, will be found very nearly to resemble those of the present times.</field>

As ye would have me in your merchandisings, Buyings and sellings, prosper you with gain, And forward you in all your undertakings; As ye would have me turn to your advantage All your concerns in business, and accounts, At home here, and abroad; as ye would wish, That I should crown your ventures now on foot, Or which shall be hereafter, with encrease Of fair, and ample, and continual gain; As ye would have me be the messenger Of good to you and yours, and tidings bring Such as shall most advance your common interest; (For ye well know, that by the other gods 'Tis giv'n me to preside o'er news and trade) As ye would have my favour in these points, Still to supply you with perpetual gain; So shall ye silently attend this play, So shall ye all be fair and upright judges. By whose command, and wherefore I am come, I'll now relate, and likewise tell my name. I come by Jove's command: my name is Mercury. My sire has sent me to implore your favour, Though by his pow'r he knew he could perforce Constrain you so to act as he should order; For he is not to learn how much ye fear And reverence high Jove, as is your duty: Yet has he order'd me with mild petition To use entreaty, and in gentle terms; For that same Jove, by whose command I come, Has not less dread of harm than any of you: Nor is it marvellous that he should fear, Born of an human sire, an human mother: And I too, even I, who am Jove's son, Have of my father caught the dread of harm: Therefore in peace I come, and bring you peace. I would entreat of you what's just and easy: For I am come a supplicant from one That's just himself, sent justly to the just: For to require what's unjust from the just, Is unbecoming; and to ask what's just From the unjust is folly, since they neither Know what is right, nor pay observance to it. Now lend attention to my words. Our will Should be your will: we both have well deserv'd, I and my sire, of you and your republic. And wherefore should I mention that I've seen In tragedies how other deities, Neptune to wit, Virtue, and Victory, Mars and Bellona, have with boasts recounted The good that they have done you? all which benefits My father wrought, the ruler of the gods: But it was never yet a custom with him To twit the good with any good he did: He thinks your gratitude repays his kindness, And that ye well deserve the good he does you. Now what I'm come to ask I'll first premise, Then tell the argument of this our tragedy. Why are your brows contracted? Is't because A tragedy I call'd it? I'm a god, And I will change it, if it be your pleasure; I will convert it from a tragedy To comedy, the verses still the same. Would ye it so, or not? But I'm a fool! As though I did not know, who am a god, What ye would have. Your minds I understand, Respecting this affair.—It shall be so; Our play shall have a proper mixture in it, So shall it be a Tragi-comedy. For, as I think, it is not right in me To make it wholly comedy, where kings And gods are introduc'd. What then remains? Why, since there is a slave in't plays a part, I'll make it, as I said, a Tragi-comedy. Now Jove has order'd me to beg of you, That the inspectors, each of them, may go Among the audience into all the seats Throughout the theatre; and if they find Any suborn'd and planted partially To clap an actor, let them take their gowns Upon the spot as lawful perquisites. Further, if any should the palm solicit For a performer, or whatever artist, Or by themselves, by writing, or by message; Or if the Ædiles should the prize decree, In violation of their oath, unjustly; Jove has commanded, that the self-same law Be put in force against them, as if any one Should seek by indirection to obtain An office in the state or for himself, Or for another. You, he said, were conquerors Through worth, not by ambition, or by perfidy. Why should the law less hold against the player, Than the chief persons in the common-wealth? From merit, not by favour, we should seek To gain the prize. He who acquits him well Will find enough to favour him, if they Are honest, to whose hands th'affair is trusted. This likewise has my father giv'n in charge, That there should be inspectors o'er the players; So that if any of them should suborn A party to applaud them, or prevent By unfair practices another's pleasing, Their dresses may be stript from off their backs, And skin too in the bargain.—Wonder not, That Jove concerns him now about the Actors: Himself will play a part in this our Comedy. Why should ye be amaz'd, as though it were A thing unheard of until now, that Jove Should turn a stage-player? Upon this stage, 'Tis but a year since,—when the actors call'd On Jupiter, he came, and lent them aid. He surely may appear in tragedy: I say then, in this play will Jove himself Perform a part, and I together with him. Now lend attention, whilst that I unfold The argument of this our Comedy. This city here is Thebes, and in that house Amphitryon dwells, an Argive by his birth, Sprung from an Argive father, and with whom Alcmena married, daughter of Electryon. This same Amphitryon now commands in chief The Theban forces; for there is a war Betwixt the Thebans and the Teleboans. Ere his departure hence to join the troops, His wife was pregnant by him. Verily Ye know my father, how he is inclin'd, How freely he indulges in love-matters, With what excess he doats, where once he loves. He for Alcmena entertain'd a passion Unknown unto the husband, and possess'd her, Whence she grew pregnant from his stol'n embrace. That ye may rightly read her situation, Know she is pregnant with a double issue, Both by her husband and by highest Jove. My father is now with her in this house, And for that reason is this night prolong'd, Whilst with his love he takes his pleasure: yet In form he seems as though he were Amphitryon. Be not astonish'd then at this my habit, That I come forth thus in a servile garb. I shall present you with an ancient tale, [Set forth in Greek, now in the Latin tongue] Made new; and therefore do I come apparell'd In a new fashion. Jupiter my father Is now within, chang'd to Amphitryon's form; And all the slaves, that see him, think he is The same, so readily he shifts his shape, Whene'er his godship pleases. And I too Have taken on myself a servant's form, The form of Sosia, he who went from hence Together with Amphitryon to the army; That in this guise my father I might serve In his amour, and no one of the family Ask who I am, when they shall see me here Frequent about the house; but as they'll think me Their fellow-servant, none will question me Or who I am, or wherefore I came hither. My father is indulging now within His heart's desire, and her, whom most he loves, Clasps in his fond embrace; recounts to her What was transacted in the army; she, Mean while, mistakes th'adulterer for her husband. He tells her how he put the enemies troops To flight, and that they gave him many gifts. These gifts, bestow'd upon Amphitryon, we Have stolen; for my father can with ease Do what he will.—Now on this very day Amphitryon will arrive here from the army, Together with his slave, whose form I bear. That ye may then distinguish us more readily, I on my hat these little wings shall wear, My father, he will bear a golden tuft; Which mark the right Amphitryon will not have: And no one of the family will be able To see these marks; ye only shall discern them. But Sosia yonder comes, Amphitryon's slave: He's from the port, and bears him hitherward, A lanthorn in his hand: he makes for home, But I shall drive him thence.—So—here he is; And he will soon be knocking at the door. It will be worth your while to mark how Jove And Mercury will play the parts of actors. [Mercury places himself before Amphitryon's door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SOSIA advances with a Lanthorn. Is there a bolder fellow?—Is there any one More stout of heart than I am?—I, who know The humours of our wild young sparks, yet dare Walk by myself at this late hour of night. What shall I do now, if the watch should seize And thrust me into prison?—Why, to-morrow I shall be serv'd up from that dainty larder, And well drest with a whipping:—not a word Allow'd me in my own defence;—no master To take my part;—and ev'ry soul will think, I've my deserts:—So shall eight sturdy fellows Bethump me like an anvil.—In this sort They'll greet me on my coming, thus receive And entertain me at the public charge!— These honours has my master forc'd upon me, Who sent me from the port so late at night Against my inclination.—Could he not Have waited till 'twas day-light to dispatch me?— This is the hardship of a great man's service, Wherefore his servant leads a plaguy life on't: By day, by night, there's work enough and more, That will not let him rest. The master, he Being free himself from labour, thinks his slave Can drudge and drudge still on, what'er befalls him; Nay, thinks it just, and never counts the toil, Or once considers, whether his commands Are right or wrong. Wherefore in servitude We suffer much oppression: yet the burthen Must be endur'd with pain. Merc. On this account I have more reason surely to complain Of servitude,—I, who before was free, Though now my father has me for his slave: This fellow, who was born a slave, complains! But hold—I only am a slave in name. Sos. Stay,—now I think on't, I should thank the gods For my arrival.—Would they recompense me As I deserve, they should commission some one To welcome me with douses on the chaps: For all their goodness has been thrown away On an ungrateful rascal. Merc. His deserts He knows then, which such fellows seldom do. Sos. Well,—To come home in a whole skin!—'twas what I never thought, or any of our people. The foes subdued, our troops are marching homeward, The war extinguish'd, and the enemy slain, That wrought such bitter troubles to our Thebans. Their town was storm'd and taken by the strength And valour of our men, but chief of all By the command and conduct of Amphitryon, My master, who has since distributed The booty, lands, and corn among the soldiery, And firmly fix'd king Creon in his throne. He has sent me home before him to acquaint His lady with the news,—with what command And conduct he discharg'd his public trust. Now let me study how to frame my story.— What if I tell her lies?—I act in character: For when the armies fought with all their might, With all my might I ran away. However, I'll make pretence that I was in the action, And speak from hearsay.—Well—but in what terms, What method it were best to tell my story, First let me here consider with myself.— (After pausing.) I'll begin thus.—“Soon as we were arriv'd, And touch'd the earth at landing, strait Amphitryon Picks out the chiefs among the chieftains, sends them Upon an embassy, commanding them To tell the Teleboans this his mind.— “If without force or war they'd willingly “Deliver up the plunderers and their plunder, “If they'd restore what they had carried off, “His army forthwith he would homeward lead; “The Greeks should quit their country, left to them “In peace and quiet: but if other-minded, “They slighted his demands, he'd then attack “Their town with all his force.”—When his ambassadours Had told this to the Teleboans, they Stout-hearted, proud of their own strength, relying On their own prowess, roughly chid our delegates. Their answer was, “they could defend themselves “And theirs by war, and counsell'd us to lead “Our army back with speed from off their borders.” This answer brought by our ambassadours, Amphitryon draws his troops from their encampments, The Teleboans theirs from out the town, Clad in bright arms: and when on either hand The armies had march'd up with all their force, The ranks were form'd; we drew up in array Our men according to our rule and practice; The enemy on their part did the same. Both generals then advanc'd before the ranks In the mid space, and there confer'd together: It was agreed, whichever should be vanquish'd In the engagement, should surrender up Their city, lands, gods, houses, and themselves. This done, the trumpets clang on either side; Earth echoes; shouts arise; the generals make Their pray'r to Jove, and here and ev'ry where Their troops encourage: each man lays about him To th'utmost of his strength; the faulchions smite; The lances shiver; and the welkin bellows With th'uproar of the soldiers: from their breaths And pantings rises a thick cloud: they fall Oppress'd with wounds and violence. At length, According to our wish, our troops prevail: Fast fall the foe: we press upon them: thus, Fierce in our strength, we conquer'd. Not a man Yet fled, or started from his post, but each Fought and maintain'd his ground: they'd sooner lose Their life, than quit their station: each that falls, Falls where he stood, and keeps his rank in death. Amphitryon, seeing this, orders the horse To charge upon the right: they quick obeying With outcries and brisk onset rush upon them, And tear and trample on the impious foe. Merc. He has not utter'd yet a single word, That is not true; for I myself was present, So was my father, when they fought this battle. Sos. The foe betook themselves to flight, which added New spirit to our men: the Teleboans Had, as they fled, their bodies fill'd with darts. Amphitryon's self with his own hand cut off King Pterelas's head. The fight continued From morn to evening:—I the more remember it, Because I went that day without a dinner. Night interpos'd at length, and broke it off. Next day the magistrates, all drown'd in tears, Came to us from the city to our camp; With cover'd hands intreat us to forgive Their trespass, and surrender up themselves, Their city, children, with all things divine And human, to the Thebans, all to be In their possession and at their disposal. Lastly, my lord Amphitryon was presented With the gold cup King Pterelas us'd to drink from, In token of his valour.”—Thus I'll tell My story to my lady. I'll proceed now T'obey my master's orders, for which purpose I'll take me home. Merc. Ah, ha! he's coming hither: I'll meet him then. I must not let him enter Within the doors to day: but since I bear His semblance, I'm resolv'd to play him off. As I've assum'd his form and garb, 'twere fit I should resemble too his deeds and manners: I must be sly,—a cunning knave,—and fight him With his own weapons, drive him from the door By villainous craft.—But, how now, what's the matter? He's staring at the sky.—I'll watch his motions. Sos. As I have faith in any thing, as sure As I know any thing, I think and know, That Night this night went drunk to bed: for see! The seven stars are motionless, the moon Has stir'd not, since she rose; nor is Orion, The evening-star, or Pleiades yet set: The signs stand stock still; and the night don't budge A jot for day. Merc. Good Night, as you've begun, Go on, obsequious to my father's pleasure: 'Tis the best service, for the best of beings, Best done; and you will find your interest in it. Sos. I think I never saw a longer night Than this, except one night, when I was drub'd, And hung up by the heels: yet this methinks Exceeds e'en that in length.—Faith I believe The Sun has drank too much, and dropt asleep. Merc. Say you so, varlet? Do you think the Gods Are like yourself?—You hang-dog!—but I'll pay you For your vile deeds and speeches. Come but hither, You'll find your ruin. Sos. Where are those gallants, So loth to lye alone?—A rare night this, To have their penny-worths of their doxies. Merc. Faith This fellow hits my master father to an ace, Who now is lying in Alcmena's arms, His heart's desire indulging. Sos. I'll go in, And tell Alcmena what my master bade me. (Advancing discovers Mercury) What do I see? a man before the house, So late at night? I like him not. Merc. The rogue Has not his equal for rank cowardice. Sos. What is he?—By his motions he should seem A weaver, and would fain now trim my jacket. Merc. He's frighten'd: I'll have sport with him. Sos. I'm ruin'd: How my teeth chatter! sure he's posted here To give me a reception with his fists. Troth he takes pity on me; and because My master now has made me keep awake, He'll lull me with his fists to sleep.—Look, look— I'm lost for ever—what a swinging rogue! How brawny!— Merc. I'll draw nearer, raise my voice That he may hear me, and from thence conceive More terrible fears within him.—(Loud) Come my fists, To action;—stir ye;—'tis a long long while Since ye have made provision for my belly. Methinks it is an age since yesterday Ye stript four men, and laid them dead asleep. Sos. I'm sore afraid, that I shall change my name; No longer simple Sosia, but be stil'd Sosia The Fifth.—He says, he laid asleep Four men: I fear, I shall augment the number. Merc. (Throwing about his arms.) There I could have him; Sa—this is the way, This does the business. Sos. He's prepar'd for action: He puts himself in posture. Merc. He sha'n't scape Without a drubbing. Sos. Who? Merc. Whoever comes This way, shall eat my fists. Sos. Pshaw! I don't like To eat so late at night—Away with them.— I supt just now—Then pray bestow your supper On them that have more appetite. Merc. This fist Is not of trifling weight. Sos. I'm a dead man: He's weighing of his fists. Merc. What if I stroak him Gently to sleep? Sos. You'll do me a great service; For I have watch'd these three whole nights together. Merc. That's but a paultry action:—No, my fist, Thou hast not learnt to smite a cheek so poorly. One glance of thine would make a man put on Another form. Sos. He'll vamp me up a-new, New mould my face. Merc. If lustily thou strik'st, A mercy on his bones! Sos. Why sure he means To bone me like an eel. I wish him further With these his boning tricks.—I'm a dead man, If he should see me now.— Merc. Some fellow stinks To his destruction. Sos. How now! do I smell? Merc. Nor can he be far off, though he has been so. Sos. Sure he's a conjurer. Merc. O how my fists Itch to be at it! Sos. If you mean on me To exercise them, prithee cool them first Against the wall. Merc. A voice flies to my ears. Sos. Unlucky, that I did not clip it's wings, Since 'tis a bird-like voice. Merc. The wretch! he calls for't, He claims it of me, a most heavy lading On his beast's back. Sos. Not I;—I have no beast Of burthen truly. Merc. Yes, he shall be loaded Well with these fists. Sos. In troth I am fatigued With coming from on shipboard, and e'en now I am so crop-sick, I can scarcely crawl, Even without a lading. Do not think then, That I can carry burthens. Merc. Certainly 'Tis Some-one speaks. Sos. I'm safe; he sees me not. He says, 'tis Some-one speaks: now verily My name is Sosia. Merc. As it seems, the voice Upon the right here strikes my ear. Sos. I fear, I shall be beaten for my voice that strikes him. Merc. He's coming tow'rds me—Good. Sos. I'm sore afraid; I'm numb'd all over.—Now could I not tell, If any one should ask me, where I am: Nor can I budge a foot, I am so frighten'd.— All's over; I have lost my master's orders, And Sosia with them.—Yet I am resolv'd To face this fellow, and bespeak him boldly; I'll seem as valiant as I can, that he May keep hands off me. (advances towards the door) Merc. You, Sir, whither go you? You there, that carry Vulcan in your horn? Sos. Who made you an examiner? you, who bone Men with your fists? Merc. Are you a slave, or free? Sos. Whichever likes me. Merc. Say'st thou? Sos. Ay, I say it. Merc. You want a drubbing, Sos. Now you lye, I don't. Merc. I'll make you own it. Sos. Wherefore? Merc. I must know Whose you are, where you're going, what's your errand. Sos. My way lies here: I am my master's servant: What are you now the wiser? Merc. I shall make you Hold that foul tongue of your's. Sos. You cannot do it: I keep it pure and clean. Merc. How! prating still? What business have you at this house? Sos. And pray What business have you here? Merc. King Creon sets A watch here ev'ry night. Sos. 'Tis gracious in him To guard our house, the while we are abroad. But prithee now go in, and tell the family Some of their fellow-servants are arriv'd. Merc. Whose fellow you may be I know not; but if You don't be gone this instant, I shall give you Such a reception, fellow, as you will not Take in good fellowship. Sos. I tell you, I Live here, and am a servant of this house. Merc. D'ye mind? unless you take yourself away, I shall exalt you. Sos. How? Merc. You shall be carry'd: If I but take a cudgel, you'll not walk, I promise you. Sos. Nay, but I do affirm, That I'm a servant in this family. Merc. Look to't—you'll have a drubbing, if you don't Be gone this instant. Sos. Would you then desire To drive me from my home, when I am just Arriv'd here from abroad? Merc. Is this your home? Sos. It is, I say. Merc. Who is your master then? Sos. Amphitryon, general of the Theban troops, The husband of Alcmena. Merc. Ha! what say you? What is your name? Sos. Our Thebans call me Sosia, The son of Davus. Merc. To thy sore mishap Art thou arriv'd, thou monster of effrontery!— With made up lies, and patch'd up knaveries. Sos. I'm come with patch'd cloaths it is true, not knaveries. Merc. You lye, 'tis with your feet you come, not cloaths. Sos. Ay verily. Merc. Ay verily then take This drubbing for your lye. (Striking him.) Sos. Indeed forsooth I don't desire it, I. Merc. Indeed forsooth But you shall have it, though you don't: indeed 'Tis so resolv'd, and 'tis not in your choice. (striking him.) Sos. I cry you mercy! Merc. Dost thou dare affirm That thou art Sosia, when myself am he? Sos. Murder! (Still striking him.) Merc. This is but little in respect Of what you'll have in future. Now whose are you? Sos. Your's: for your fists have mark'd me for your own.— (Mercury continues to strike him) Help, help, good Citizens! Merc. Still bawling, Sirrah? Speak, wherefore came you here? Sos. That you might have Somebody to belabour with your fists. Merc. Whose are you then? Sos. I say, Amphitryon's Sosia. Merc. You shall be drubb'd more heartily for this, You talk so idly.—I myself am Sosia, Not you. Sos. I would to heav'n you were indeed, That I were beating you! (Aside) Merc. What! muttering? Sos. I'll Be dumb now. Merc. Who's your master? Sos. Whom you will. Merc. Come prithee, what's your name? Sos. I have no name, But what you shall command. Merc. You said you was Amphitryon's Sosia. Sos. I mistook: I meant To say, I was Amphitryon's Associate. Merc. I knew we had no servant of the name Of Sosia but myself.—You've lost the use Sure of your reason.— Sos. Would that you had lost The use too of your fists! (Aside.) Merc. I am that Sosia, You said you was. Sos. Let us discourse in peace, I pray you,—without hazard of a beating. Merc. Well, for a while then we will hold a truce, If you have ought to say. Sos. I will not speak, Till peace is ratified, for you are mightier In fists than I. Merc. If you have ought to offer, Speak; I'll not hurt you. Sos. May I trust your honour? Merc. You may. Sos. But what if you deceive me? Merc. Then May Mercury's displeasure light on Sosia! Sos. Mark.—Now I am allow'd to speak with freedom, I am Amphitryon's Sosia. Merc. What, again? (Offering to strike.) Sos. The peace is made, the covenant's ratified: I speak the truth. Merc. Beware thee of a beating. (Threatening.) Sos. Do as you please, and what you please;—'tis true, In fists you are the mightier,—yet I'll not Be silent on this point, do what you may. Merc. Nay, you shall never make me, while you live, Other than Sosia. Sos. Nor shall you make me An alien here.—We have no other Sosia But me, who went to th'army with Amphitryon. Merc. The fellow's mad. Sos. 'Tis you that are distemper'd. Why, what a plague! Am I not Sosia, Amphitryon's slave? Did not the ship, that brought me, Arrive this night here from the Persian port? Did not my master send me? Do not I Stand here before our house now? Have I not A lanthorn in my hand? Do I not speak? Am I not broad awake? Did not this man Bethump me with his fists?—In troth he did; My cheeks smart to my sorrow still.—Then why, Why do I doubt? why don't I go directly Into our house? (Makes up to the door.) Merc. (Stepping between.) What! your house? Sos. 'Tis so truly. Merc. Tis all a lye, all, ev'ry syllable That you have said.—I am Amphitryon's Sosia: This night our vessel left the Persian port: The city we besieg'd, where Pterelas reign'd, The Teleboan forces we o'erthrew By dint of arms: Amphitryon's self cut off King Pterelas' head in battle. Sos. I can scarce (Aside.) Believe myself, when I thus hear him talk: He tells it off hand, as it were without book, What was transacted in the war.—But heark ye, What present from the Teleboan spoils Was given to Amphitryon? Merc. A gold cup, King Pterelas us'd to drink from. Sos. He has said.— But where now is the cup? Merc. 'Tis in a casket Seal'd with Amphitryon's seal. Sos. What's the impression? Merc. Sol rising in his chariot.—What, you rascal, Are you upon the catch? Sos. His arguments Have overcome me: I must e'en go seek Another name.—'Tis strange, where he could see All this.—But I shall trap him now most rarely: For what I did alone, when no one else Was in the tent, that he can never tell.— (to Mercury) If you are Sosia,—tell me,—while the armies Were in the heat of battle, what did you Do in the tent?—Tell that, and I knock under. Merc. There was a cask of wine.—I fill'd a cup— Sos. He has hit it. Merc. —Suck'd it down unmixt, and pure As from the mother it was born. Sos. O wonderful! He must have hid him in the cup.—'Tis fact: I drank a cup-full of sheer wine. Merc. What now? Have I convinc'd thee, that thou art not Sosia? Sos. Do you deny it? Merc. Can I but deny it, When I am he? Sos. By Jupiter I swear, I am, nor do I lye. Merc. I swear by Mercury, Jupiter won't believe thee; for I know He'll sooner credit me without an oath Than with one he will thee. Sos. Tell me, at least Who am I, if so be I am not Sosia? I ask you that. Merc. My pleasure when it is No longer to be Sosia, then be thou Sosia, and welcome. Now that I am he, Begone, as thou would'st 'scape a drubbing.—Hence, Thou fellow! Sos. Now I view him well, by heav'ns I see my very figure, such as I Have often seen it in a glass.—'Tis certain, He's very like me.—The same hat, same coat— He is as like me as I'm like myself.— The shanks, feet, stature, shorn pate, eyes, nose, teeth, Lips, cheeks, chin, beard, neck—'tis myself all over! Need I say more to't?—If his back be scar'd, There's nothing can be liker than this likeness. —Yet surely, when I think on't, I'm the same I ever was: I know my master, know Our house: and verily I have not lost My wits nor senses.—I'll not heed this fellow, Say what he will, but knock here at the door. Merc. Whither so fast? Sos. Why, home. Merc. Tho' thou wer't now To mount the car of Jove, and fly from hence, Scarce should'st thou 'scape destruction. Sos. May I not Deliver my master's message to my mistress? Merc. To thine deliver what thou wilt, I care not: But I'll not suffer thee t'approach our lady.— And now, if once thou dost provoke me, fellow, Depart thou shalt not without broken bones. Sos. I'll be gone rather.—Heav'ns have mercy on me! Where did I lose myself? where was I changed? Why did I lose my form? or was I haply So thoughtless as to leave myself behind here? For certainly this fellow is possest Of my whole image, which was mine before. [My statue is erected in my stead:] What never will be done when I am dead, Is done, while now I'm living.—I'll return Back to the port, and tell this to my master.— But if he likewise know me not!—O Jupiter, Grant that he may not:—so shall I directly Cover my shorn crown with the cap of freedom. [Exit Sosia. SCENE II. MERCURY alone. Well!—our affair goes prosperously on. I have remov'd the greatest obstacle; So that my father may indulge his love Securely with Alcmena.—Now this fellow, Soon as he sees Amphitryon, will tell him, That Sosia drove him Sosia from the door. What must his master think, but that he lyes? He'll not believe it, that his slave has been Here, as he had commanded. Thus shall both, And all Amphitryon's family, be fill'd With error and distraction, till my father Has full enjoyment had of her he loves E'en to satiety.—Then all will know What has been done: my father in the end Will reconcile Alcmena with her husband, Holding their ancient concord: for Amphitryon Will make an heavy bustle with his wife, Accusing her of foul incontinence.— This strife my father will appease.—And now As for Alcmena, (for of her as yet I've said but little,) she'll to-day bring forth Twin-sons; one born ten months from his conception, The other sev'n: the one Amphitryon's is, The other Jupiter's: The younger owns The greater sire, the elder the inferior.— D'ye comprehend the mystery?—Yet more,— So tender is he of Alcmena's honour, My father has provided these shall both Be born together, that one painful labour May serve for both, and that she might not fall Under suspicion of unchastity, But their clandestine loves remain conceal'd. Though as I said, Amphitryon shall know all:— What then?—There's no one will impute it surely As scandal to Alcmena: for it would not Be acting like a God to let the blame Of his offences light upon a mortal.— I must stop here,—the door creeks,—and here comes The counterfeit Amphitryon with his wife That he has borrow'd. (Retires from the door.) SCENE III. Enter JUPITER and ALCMENA. Jup. Farewell, my Alcmena: Take care of that, in which we both have interest; And O! be sparing of yourself, I pray you: You've gone, you know the full time of your reckoning.— I must away hence of necessity:— Whatever child is born, you'll bring it up. Alc. My lord, what business can it be, that you Should quit your home so sudden? Jup. By my faith It is not, that I'm wearied or of you, Or of my home: But when the chief commander Is absent from his army, 'tis more likely Things will be done, which help not, than which ought. Merc. A crafty cousener he, this sire of mine! Mind ye—how sweetly does he smooth her o'er! Alc. Ah! I do find indeed now by experience, How much you prize your wife! Jup. Is't not enough, I love her more than any of her sex? Merc. Faith; if your wife but know your tricks, I warrant You'd rather be Amphitryon than high Jove. Alc. 'Twould please me more to find it than be told so. You leave me ere the bed, in which you lay, Could well grow warm: you came at midnight to me; And now you're gone again.—Say, is this kind? Merc. I will approach and speak to her, and second My father in his wheedling. (To Alcmena.) Never sure Did mortal man so doat upon a wife! He loves you to distraction. Jup. Rogue! I know you:— Out of my sight.—What business is't of your's? Hang-dog!—how dare you chatter?—If I take A stick in hand— Alc. O don't be in a rage. Jup. Do, mutter, sirrah. Merc. (Aside.) This my first attempt At wheedling has, I find, but ill succeeded. Jup. Sweet wife, you ought not to be angry with me For that which you complain of.—I withdrew In secret from the army, stole this interview, That you might be the first to learn from me, How I succeeded.—I have told you all.— This, if I had not lov'd you to th'extreme, I had not done. Merc. (Aside.) So—is't not as I said? See, how this stroking cheers her! Jup. I must now Return from hence in secret, left the troops Should scent my absence, when they'll say, that I Prefer'd my wife before the public good. Alc. I cannot chuse but weep for your departure. Jup. Come, come, no more bewailings: do not spoil Those pretty eyes: I shortly shall return. Alc. Ah me! that shortly will be all too long. Jup. 'Tis with reluctance I must leave you here, And part thus from you. Alc. Ay, I do perceive it: For on the very night you came to me, On that same you depart. (Hangs about Jupiter.) Jup. Why do you hold me? 'Tis time; and I would leave the city ere It waxes light.—Alcmena, with this cup I now present you, giv'n me for my valour, The same king Pterelas drank from, whom I slew With my own hand. Alc. (Taking the cup.) Done like your other actions: As you are always wont to do.—By heavens A noble gift, and worthy him that gave it! Merc. A noble gift indeed, and worthy her To whom 'tis giv'n! Jup. You rascal! what again? Why don't I put an end to you at once, And your impertinence? Alc. Nay prithee, love, Do not be angry for him with my sake. Jup. Sweet, you shall be obey'd. Merc. (Aside.) How plaguy cross. His wenching makes him! Jup. (Going.) Would you ought else? Alc. This—that you'd love me, though I am away, Me that am your's still, though you're absent from me. Merc. 'Tis almost day, Sir: come, Sir, let's be going. Jup. Go you before: I'll follow you this instant. [Exit Mercury. Would you ought else? Alc. Yes, one thing—that you would Return, and presently. Jup. It shall be so: My presence shall forerun your expectation. Be of good heart, my love. [Exit Alcmena. SCENE IV. JUPITER alone. Now, gentle Night, Who long for me hast tarried, I dismiss thee; Yield thee to Day, that he at length may break On mortals with a clear unclouded light: And in proportion, Night, as thou wast lengthen'd Beyond thy next career, by so much Day Shall shorten his, that the disparity Betwixt you may be squar'd, and Day to Night Duly succeed.—I'll go, and follow Mercury. [Exit Jupiter. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter AMPHITRYON and SOSIA, at the further End of the Stage. AMPHITRYON. Come, follow me. Sos. I do, I'm after you, Close at your heels. Amph. Thou art the veriest rogue,— Sos. For why? Amph. Because you tell me what is not, Nor was, nor will be. Sos. Look ye now,—'tis like you— You ne'er believe your servants. Amph. What!—how's that? By heav'ns, thou villain, I'll at once cut out That villainous tongue of thine. Sos. I'm your's, and you May use me as you please, and as it suits you; But as I've told you the plain fact, you cannot Make me recant my story. Amph. Why, you villain,— Dare you affirm, that you are now at home, And here too, at this very time? Sos. 'Tis true though. Amph. A plague confound you!—which the Gods will order, And so will I. Sos. I'm your's, and in your power. Amph. Slave! dare you put your tricks upon your master? Dare you affirm, what man yet never saw?— What never can be?—that the self-same person Should at one time be in two different places? Sos. Indeed, 'tis fact I tell you. Amph. Jove confound you! Sos. In what have I deserv'd ill at your hands? Amph. Villain, d'ye ask, who make me thus your sport? Sos. With reason you might curse me, were't not so: I do not lye, but tell you the plain fact. Amph. The fellow's drunk, I think. Sos. I would I were! Amph. You have your wish already. Sos. I? Amph. Yes, you.— Say, where have you been drinking? Sos. No where truly. Amph. What sort of fellow is it? Sos. I have told you Ten times already.—I'm at home, I say; And I,—d'ye mark me? I, that self-same Sosia, Am here with you.—What think you? do I speak Plain enough now, and to the purpose? Amph. Hence, Avaunt,—go, get thee from me. Sos. What's the matter? Amph. The plague has seiz'd you. Sos. Why d'ye say so?—Faith I feel, Sir, very well. Amph. But I shall make you Feel very ill, and very miserable, As you deserve, when I get home.—Come, follow me, You, who abuse your master's easy nature With vain and frantic stories; who, because You have neglected to perform his orders, Come to deride him.—You relate such gross Impossibilities, such as before Were never heard of—Knave!—But ev'ry lye Your back shall answer. Sos. Of all grievances This is most grievous to a trusty servant; That, though he tell his master truth, the truth He is beat out of by authority. Amph. How this can be, convince me, thou vile plague, With arguments.—I fain would have explain'd, How you can be at home, and yet be here. Sos. Troth I'm both here and there.—Well may one wonder! Nor can it seem more strange to you than me. Amph. As how? Sos. I say, it cannot seem more strange To you than me; nor, as I hope for mercy, Did I at first believe Me-Myself Sosia, Till Sosia, t'other I-Myself, convinc'd me. He told distinctly ev'ry thing that past During our sojourn with the enemy:— Then he has robb'd me of my very figure Together with my name.—One drop of milk Is not more like another than that I Is like to Me: for when you sent me home, Before 'twas day-break, from the port— Amph. What then? Sos. I at the door was standing long before I came there. Amph. Plague! what trifling stuff is this? Have you your senses? Sos. I am as you see me. Amph. Sure, since he left me, he has been bewitch'd, And work'd on by ill hands. Sos. Ill hands, I own; For he has maul'd me with his fists most sadly. Amph. Who beat you? Sos. I-Myself beat Me-myself, I that am now at home. Amph. Be sure you answer Nothing but what I ask you.—First of all, I willingly would learn, who is that Sosia? Sos. Your servant. Amph. In good sooth I have one more By you, than I could wish; nor ever had I, Since I was born, another servant Sosia Besides yourself. Sos. But I do tell you now, You'll find, when you go home, another Sosia Besides myself; the son of Davus; sprung From the same father as myself; in form, And age, the same too with myself. In short, You've here a double Sosia. Amph. Your account Is wondrous strange!—But have you seen my wife? Sos. He would not let me come within the door. Amph. Who hinder'd you? Sos. That Sosia, He I spoke of, Who maul'd me with his fists. Amph. Who is that Sosia? Sos. Myself, I say:—how often must I tell you? Amph. But what is't you are talking?—Have you not Been sleeping all the while? Sos. No, not the least. Amph. Haply you saw, if any such you saw, That Sosia in a dream. Sos. I am not wont To dream o'er your commands.—Awake I saw him, Awake I see you now; awake I'm talking; And with his fists just now did He awake Maul Me awake. Amph. What He? Sos. I tell you, Sosia, That I-He.—Prithee, don't you understand? Amph. How is it possible, that any one Should understand such jargon as you jabber? Sos. But you will know him quickly.— Amph. Who? Sos. You'll know That other Sosia. Amph. Follow me.—'Tis needful, I should first sift this matter.—See that all things Be brought from ship-board, as I order'd. Sos. I am Mindful and diligent t'obey your orders. I have not drank up your authority Together with my wine. Amph. Now would to heav'n, The fact may turn out different from your story! [They keep aloof.] SCENE II. Enter ALCMENA attended by THESSALA. Alc. How scanty are the pleasures in life's course, If plac'd in opposition to it's troubles! For in the life of man to ev'ry one 'Tis thus allotted, thus it pleases heaven, That Sorrow, her companion, still should tread Upon the heels of Pleasure; and if ought Of good befal us, forthwith there should follow Of ill a larger portion.—This I feel, And know it of myself now, unto whom A little spice of pleasure was imparted, In that it was permitted me to see My husband but one night:—he left me, and Departed on a sudden, ere 'twas day.— Here seem I now deserted and forlorn, Since he I doat on, prizing above all, Is absent from me.—I have ta'en of grief From the departure of my husband more Than I receiv'd of pleasure from his coming. In this, however, am I blest at least, That he has conquer'd, and is home return'd With honours heap'd upon him:—that's a comfort. Let him be absent; so that he return Crown'd with the acquisition of bright fame, I'll bear it, his departure, with a mind Resolv'd and stedfast:—If this recompense Be giv'n me, that my husband shall be stiled A conqueror in battle, I shall think I have enough.—Valour's the best reward: 'Tis Valour, that surpasses all things else: Our liberty, our safety, life, estate, Our parents, children, country are by this Preserv'd, protected: Valour ev'ry thing Comprises in itself; and ev'ry good Awaits the man, who is possess'd of Valour. Amph. I am persuaded, that my coming home Most eagerly is wish'd for by my wife, Who loves me, and by me no less is lov'd;— But more especially, seeing success Has crown'd our enterprise, the enemy Subdued, by all men deem'd invincible:— (Them by my conduct and command we vanquish'd In the first battle.) Of a truth I know, She much expects, and longs for my return. Sos. And don't you think my Dear expects me too? [Amphitryon advances, with Sosia.] Alc. Sure, 'tis my husband. Amph. Follow me this way. Alc. Wherefore returns he, when he said just now He was in hurry to be gone?—And is it His purpose then to try me?—Would he prove, How I affect his parting?—By my faith To me he's always welcome. Sos. We had best On board again, Sir, Amph. Wherefore? Sos. Nobody. Will give us here a dinner. Amph. How came that Into your mind? Sos. Because we're come too late. Amph. How so? Sos. See there before our house Alcmena Stands with her belly full. Amph. At my departure I left her big with child. Sos. Alas, poor me! Amph. Why? What's the matter? Sos. O I am come home Just in the nick of time to fetch her water: For she is gone, according to your reckoning, Ten months. Amph. Have a good heart. Sos. Nay, do you know What a good heart I have? If I but take The bucket once in hand, now never trust me From this day forward, if I do not draw The well's heart's-blood up, when I set about it. Amph. Follow me.—Never fear: I will appoint Another to that business. Alc. (advancing) I shall shew My duty more, if I approach and meet him. [Amphitryon and Alcmena meet.] Amph. With joy Amphitryon greets his wish'd-for spouse, Whom he accounts the best of all in Thebes, Whom all our Thebans so extol for virtue! How have you far'd this age since?—Did you long For my return? Sos. (ironically) O yes, extremely long'd!— One could not take less notice of a dog. Amph. It joys me that I see you burthen'd thus, Bearing your load so well. Alc. Prithee, my lord, Why do you thus salute me in the way Of mockery? why address me all so strange, As though you had not seen me very lately, As though it were the first time you return'd Home hither from the conquest of your foes? Why, why do you accost me now, as though You had not seen me for a long time past? Amph. By all that's sacred, never till this hour Have I beheld you. Alc. Why will you deny it? Amph. Because that I have learnt to speak the truth. Alc. He who unlearns what he has learnt, does wrong.— You'd try my disposition!—But what makes you Return so soon?—Has any ominous thing Retarded, or the weather kept you back?— How comes it to the army you're not gone, As lately you declar'd that you was going? Amph. Lately! how lately was it? Alc. Do you try me?— A while ago, just now, this very instant. Amph. How can that be, I pray you, as you say,— A while ago, just now? Alc. And can you think I'd play the fool as you do, who maintain This is your first arrival, when e'en now You parted hence? Amph. How wild she talks! Sos. Have patience, Till she has slept out this one dream. Amph. She dreams With her eyes open. Alc. No, I do not dream; But am awake, and waking I relate That which is true: for now ere break of day I saw both him and you. Amph. Where? in what place? Alc. Here, in your own house. Amph. No, it could not be. Sos. Hold, Sir.—Who knows but that the vessel brought us From the port hither, while we were asleep? Amph. Will you too join in her extravagance? Sos. What would you have me do, Sir? Don't you know, If you oppose a Bacchant in her rage, You'll make her desperate; she'll strike the oft'ner; But if you humour her, one stroke contents her. Amph. By heav'ns but I'm resolv'd to rate her, since She will not welcome me. Sos. Do, thrust your hand Into an hornet's nest. Amph. Hold your tongue, sirrah.— Alcmena, I would ask one question. Alc. Ask, And welcome. Amph. Is it frenzy, or is't pride, Which thus possesses you? Alc. My lord!—How came it Into your thoughts to ask so strange a question? Amph. You were wont hitherto to welcome me On my return, and greet me in such terms, As virtuous wives use to their husbands.—Now I've found your practice other. Alc. By my faith, My lord, most certainly on yesternight I welcom'd you as soon as you arriv'd, And ask'd you at the same time of your health, And took you by the hand, and gave a kiss. Sos. How! yesternight you welcom'd him? Alc. I did;— And you too, Sosia. Sos. Sir! I was in hopes, She'd bring you forth a boy; but now, believe me, She is not gone with child. Amph. How do you mean? Sos. Far gone with madness. Alc. No, I am not mad, And pray to heav'n to speed me in my labour;— But if your master treat you as he ought, You'll be rewarded for your ominous words.— 'Twill hap ill to you. Sos. It should be to you: An apple's proper for a pregnant woman, That she may have something to chew upon, If she begin to faint. Amph. You saw me here Last night? Alc. I did, I say:—must I repeat it Ever so often? Amph. In a dream perhaps. Alc. No, we were both awake. Amph. Alas! alas! Sos. What ails you, Sir? Amph. My wife is gone distracted. Sos. She's troubled with black bile, and nothing sooner Works men to madness. Amph. (to Alc.) When did you perceive Yourself first seiz'd? Alc. By heav'n there's nothing ails me. Amph. Why then d'ye say you saw me, when we came But last night into port; and there I sup'd, There rested the whole night on board the ship; Nor have I set my foot here in the house, Since with the army I march'd hence against Our foes the Teleboans, and o'ercame them. Alc. With me you sup'd, with me you pass'd the night. Amph. How's that? Alc. I speak the truth. Amph. No, not in this, Howe'er in other matters. Alc. You departed Back to the army at the dawn of day. Amph. How could that be? Sos. She's very right: she's telling you Her dream, while now 'tis fresh upon her memory. Indeed, good dreaming Madam, when you wak'd, You should have offer'd a salt cake or frankincense To Jove, disposer of strange prodigies. Alc. A mischief on your head! Sos. On your's, unless You have a care. Alc. This Fellow dares again Speak rudely to me with impunity. Amph. (to Sosia.) Hold your tongue, sirrah. (to Alc.) Tell me, did I leave you At break of day this morning? Alc. Who but you Recounted to me, how the battle went? Amph. And know you that too? Alc. Surely,—since from you I heard it; how you took their capital city, And slew king Pterelas yourself. Amph. Did I, I tell you this? Alc. Yes, you;—and Sosia here Was by too. Amph. (to Sosia.) Did you hear me tell her this? Sos. Where should I hear you? Amph. Ask herself. Sos. In troth No, never in my presence, that I know of. Alc. Ay to be sure,—he'll contradict you doubtless! Amph. Come hither, sirrah:—look me in the face. Sos. I do, Sir. Amph. I would have you speak the truth Without or favour or affection to me.— Say, did you hear me give her such account, As she affirms? Sos. Prithee art thou too mad, To ask me such a question?—when it is The first time I have seen you here together. Amph. Now, Madam!—do you hear?— Alc. I hear him utter That which is false. Amph. So—then you won't believe Or him, or me your husband? Alc. I believe Myself,—and know what I have said is true. Amph. Will you affirm I came here yesterday? Alc. Will you deny you went from hence to-day? Amph. I do;—and do affirm, that this is now My first arrival. Alc. And will you deny too, That you presented me with a gold cup, You told me had been giv'n to you? Amph. By heav'n I neither gave it you, nor told you of it;— Though I was so dispos'd, and am so now, That cup to give you.—But who told you of it? Alc. I heard it from yourself,—from your own hands Receiv'd the cup. Amph. Hold, hold, I do beseech you.— Sosia, I marvel much how she should know I was presented with a golden cup;— Unless yourself have lately been with her, And told her all. Sos. Not I;—I never told her, Nor saw her, till with you, now. Alc. What a knave!— Would you that I produce the cup? Amph. Produce it. Alc. It shall be done.—Go, Thessala, and bring The cup here, which my husband this day gave me. [Thessala goes in, and Amphitryon and Sosia walk on one side.] Amph. Step hither, Sosia.—Of all wonders I Should wonder most, if she should have the cup. Sos. Can you suppose that possible, when here It's in the casket, (shewing it) seal'd with your own seal? Amph. Is the seal whole? Sos. Look at it. Amph. 'Tis secure,— Just as I seal'd it. Sos. Should she not be treated Like a mad person? Amph. On my troth there's need on't; For sure she is possess'd. [Thessala returns with a Gold Cup.] Alc. Need there more words? See, here's the cup. Amph. O give it to me. Alc. There,— Look at it well, you that deny your deeds: But this will openly convince you.—Say, Is't not the same, with which you was presented? Amph. O Jupiter! what do I see?—It is The very cup.—Sosia, undone for ever! Sos. Sure she's the greatest juggler that e'er breath'd, Or else the cup must be in here. Amph. Dispatch,— Open the casket,—quick. Sos. Why need I open it? 'Tis seal'd securely:—so far all is well.— You have brought forth, Sir, an Amphitryon; I A Sosia:—If the cup bring forth a cup, Then shall we all have doubled one another. Amph. I am resolv'd to open, and inspect. Sos. Look if the seal be right,—that afterwards You may not lay the blame on me. Amph. Come open it This instant; for she means to drive us mad. Alc. Whence could I have this present but from you? Amph. That must I find. Sos. (Opening the casket.) O Jupiter! O Jupiter! Amph. What ails you? Sos. There's no cup here in the casket! Amph. What do I hear? Sos. The truth. Amph. Sad truth for you, Unless the cup appear. Alc. (Shewing it.) It doth appear. Amph. Who gave it to you? Alc. He that asks the question. Sos. You're on the catch, good master!—You have stole Some other way in private from the ship Before me, took the cup out, giv'n it her, And seal'd the casket up again. Amph. Ah me! You help her frenzy too.—(To Alc.) You say we came Last night here? Alc. So I say, and on your coming Strait you saluted me, as I did you, And met you with a kiss. Amph. (aside) I do not like That kiss in the beginning.—Well—go on. Alc. You bath'd. Amph. What after bathing? Alc. You sat down To table. Sos. Bravo! excellent! examine her. Amph. (To Sos.) Don't interrupt,—(to Alc.) Proceed you in your story. Alc. The supper being serv'd, we supp'd together. I sat me down— Amph. On the same couch? Alc. The same. Sos. So then!—methinks this banquet is not relish'd! Amph. (to Sos.) Let her go on.—(to Alc.) What after we had supp'd? Alc. You said you found yourself inclin'd to sleep: The table was remov'd: we went to bed. Amph. Where did you lye? Alc. With you, in the same chamber, In the same bed. Amph. You've utterly destroy'd me! Sos. What ails you? Amph. She has giv'n me my death's wound! Alc. What have I done, I pray? Amph. Don't speak to me. Sos. What ails you? Amph. O I am a lost, lost wretch, Since foul dishonour, while I was away, Has stain'd her chastity. Alc. My Lord!—I pray you, Why do I hear such language from your tongue? Amph. Am I your Lord?—Thou false one!—do not call me By that false name. Sos. A pretty business truly, If she has chang'd him now from Lord to Lady! Alc. What have I done, that you should talk to me In terms like these? Amph. When you yourself proclaim What you have done, why ask of me in what You have offended? Alc. Is my being with you, Who are my husband, an offence to you? Amph. With me? was you with me?—O impudence Unparallel'd!—If you are void of shame, You might at least have borrow'd the appearance. Alc. The crime, with which you charge me, ne'er disgrac'd Our family; and though you mean to fix The imputation on me of incontinence, You cannot trap me. Amph. O immortal Gods!— At least you know me, Sosia? Sos. Pretty well. Amph. Did I not sup last-night on board our ship In the Euboean port? Alc. I have at hand Witnesses likewise, ready to confirm All that I say. Amph. How! witnesses? Alc. Yes, witnesses. Amph. You produce witnesses? Alc. Yet one's sufficient: For nobody was by besides ourselves, But Sosia. Sos. Troth I know not what to say In this affair.—Haply there is some other Amphitryon, who takes care, Sir, of your business, And does your office here, while you're away. 'Tis very wonderful that other Sosia,— But this Amphitryon is a greater wonder! Alc. Now by the kingdom of the Pow'r Supreme, By Juno, Matron Goddess, whom to fear And reverence is most fitting, here I swear, That never mortal man, save you alone, Has had my love,—none wooed me to dishonour. Amph. Would this were true! Alc. I speak the very truth; But all in vain, since you will not believe. Amph. You are a woman, and can boldly swear. Alc. Bold may she be, who no offence has wrought, And with a confident and haughty spirit Plead her own cause. Amph. You're bold enough. Alc. No more Than does become a modest and a virtuous. Amph. As far as words can make you, you are honest. Alc. I hold not that my portion, which is call'd so, But honour, modesty, subdued desires, Fear of the gods, affection for my parents, And friendship with my kindred,—that to you I am obedient, bounteous to the good, And ever ready to assist the virtuous. Sos. Now by my soul, if what she says is true, She is the very model of perfection. Amph. I scarce know who I am, I'm so bewilder'd. Sos. You are Amphitryon doubtless: but beware, You do not lose yourself; for men, you find, Are strangely metamorphos'd since our coming. Amph. I am resolv'd to search into this matter. Alc. With all my heart. Amph. How say you?—answer me. What if I bring your kinsman Naucrates, Who in the same ship bore me company:— If he deny all you assert for fact, What treatment is your due?—Can you shew cause, Why you should not be punish'd with divorce? Alc. Prove me delinquent, then there is no cause. Amph. Agreed.—You, Sosia, lead these captives in.— I'll find out Naucrates, and bring him hither, [Exit Amphitryon. Sos. (To Alc.) Now there is no one here besides ourselves, Tell me in sober sadness, is there not Within another Sosia, like to me? Alc. Go, fellow—a fit slave for such a master! Sos. I will be gone for good, if you command. [Exit Sosia. Alcmena alone. 'Tis wondrous strange, my husband should be pleas'd Thus to accuse me of so foul a crime, So wrongfully.—But I shall learn it soon, Whate'er the cause be, from my kinsman Naucrates. [Alcmena goes in. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. JUPITER addresses himself to the Spectators. I'm that Amphitryon, whose slave is Sosia: The same is Mercury, when there's occasion: My dwelling's in the highest loft; and I Am also Jupiter, whene'er I please: But now that I descend, I shift my garb, And strait I am Amphitryon. For your sakes I now come hither, that I might not leave This play imperfect. I am come besides To bring the innocent Alcmena aid, Whose husband has accus'd her of dishonour:— The crime myself contriv'd, to let it fall Upon her guiltless head, were baseness in me. Now will I feign me, as I did before, To be Amphitryon, and confound the house; The mystery I'll afterwards disclose. I will afford Alcmena timely aid; And at the self-same birth the child by me, And that with which she's pregnant by her husband, I'll cause her to bring forth without a pang.— I order'd Mercury to follow me Forthwith, if haply I should want his service.— But see, Alcmena comes—I must accost her. [Jupiter retires back. SCENE II. Enter ALCMENA. I cannot bear to stay here in the house— O that my husband should accuse me thus Of wanton prostitution and dishonour! Facts he avers on facts, and loudly clamours, Whilst to my charge he lays things never done, Never by me admitted, or allow'd. He thinks too I shall bear it with indifference:— No, by the Gods, I will not: I'll not suffer The imputation of dishonesty To lay against me without cause; for I Will either leave him, or from him receive Due satisfaction: further, he shall swear, That he repents him it had e'er been said, What he alledg'd against me innocent. Jup. I must consent to do what she requires, If I would meet reception as a lover. And since it is imputed to Amphitryon What I have acted, and my love for her Has wrought her trouble although innocent, I that am innocent must feel th'effects Of his reproaches and resentment t'wards her. Alc. But lo! behold him here,—see, see the man, That charges me, unhappy as I am, With shameless prostitution and dishonour. Jup. (Advancing.) Wife, I would hold discourse with you.—Ah why, Why do you turn away your face thus from me? Alc. It is my nature.—I have always loath'd To look upon my foes. Jup. Your foes! Alc. So is it,— I speak the truth,—although you will pretend, This too is false. Jup. (Offering to embrace her.) Nay, now you are too angry. Alc. Keep your hands off:—for sure, if you are wise, Or in your senses, you would never hold Parley with her, in earnest or in mirth, Whom you imagine and pronounce a strumpet; No, no,—unless of all the fools that are You are the veriest dolt. Jup. It does not make you A whit the more so, for because I said it:— Nor do I think you such: and therefore am I Hither return'd, to clear myself before you. For nothing ever did I lay to heart So sore as the report of your displeasure. Why did you mention it? Yourself shall say, I can acquit me of design.—By heav'n I did not think that you was false; 'twas only To try your temper, see what you would do, And with what ease you would be brought to bear it. All that I said indeed was said in mirth, Only for sport: do but ask Sosia else. Alc. But why not bring my kinsman Naucrates, To testify you was not here before? Jup. It is not fair to turn to earnest what Was only spoke in jest. Alc. But yet I know, And feel, how much it pains me to the heart! Jup. By your right hand, Alcmena, I intreat, Implore, beseech, you'd grant me this request:— Forgive me, and be angry now no longer. Alc. I by my virtue render your reproaches Vain, and of no effect; and though you now Acquit me of dishonour, I'd avoid The very imputation.—Fare you well; Keep your own things, and give me mine. You'll suffer My women to attend me? Jup. Are you mad? Alc. Or if you will not, I will go without them, Bearing my virtue with me for companion. (going.) Jup. Stay:—I submit this oath to your discretion. “I do believe my wife is truly virtuous:”— If I deceive in this, then, highest Jove, I do beseech you, let your anger fall With unremitted vengeance on Amphitryon. Alc. Ah! may he rather be propitious to him! Jup. Trust that he will: The oath, that I have taken, Is a sincere and true one.—Now, I hope, You're no more angry. Alc. I am not. Jup. 'Tis well. For in the life of men full many a chance Befals them in this wise: and now they take Their fill of pleasure, then again of misery: Now quarrels intervene, and now again They're reconcil'd:—but when these kind of quarrels Haply arise betwixt two loving souls, When reconciliation's made again, Their friendship doubles that they held before. Alc. You ought not to have said what late you did: But, as you clear yourself, I am content. Jup. See that the sacred vessels be prepar'd, To pay the vows I promis'd to perform, If I return'd in safety. Alc. I'll take care. Jup. Call Sosia hither. He shall go to Blepharo, The master of our vessel, and invite him To come and dine with us.—As for himself, (aside.) He shall be fool'd so as to lose his dinner; And when unwittingly Amphitryon comes, I'll drag him by the throat from hence. Alc. I wonder What he is talking to himself about! But the door opens—Oh, 'tis Sosia comes. SCENE III. Enter SOSIA. I'm here.—Command me, if you want my service: I will obey your orders. Jup. You are come Most opportunely. Sos. Is it peace betwixt ye? For I am glad, and 'tis a pleasure to me, To see ye in good humour. It becomes A trusty servant still to fashion him So as to be himself as is his master, To set his face by his face, to be grave If he is grave, and merry if he's merry.— But come now, tell me, are you reconcil'd? Jup. You jeer me sure,—as if you did not know, That what I said before was but in jest. Sos. In jest you said it? By my troth I thought You spoke it seriously in sober sadness. Jup. I've clear'd myself: we've made peace. Sos. Best of all. Jup. I have a solemn business to transact Within, which I have vow'd. Sos. Ay, I suppose so. Jup. Go to the vessel, in my name invite The master, Blepharo, to dine with me After the sacrifice. Sos. I shall be here, Ere you can think me there. Jup. Return with speed. [Exit Sosia. Alc. Would you ought else? or shall I now go in, That what is needful be prepar'd? Jup. Pray go, And to your best see ev'ry thing be ready. Alc. Come in, what time you will: I'll take due care, That nothing shall be wanting. Jup. 'Tis well spoken: Like an observant wife. [Alcmena goes in. SCENE IV. JUPITER alone. So—both of these The servant and the mistress, are deceiv'd, In thinking me Amphitryon: much they err. Now, thou immortal Sosia, be at hand:— (You hear me, though not present:)—You must bar Amphitryon's entrance, and contrive to fool him, While I indulge me with this borrow'd wife. Look to't,—you know my pleasure,—and assist me, While to myself I offer sacrifice. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter MERCURY running, at the further End of the stage. Stand by, make room, all clear the way before me, Nor any be so bold to stop my speed. [To the Spectators.] Why may not I, who am a deity, Have the same licence as a slave in comedies, With threats to bid the people clear the way? He comes to tell th'arrival of a ship, Or the approach of an enrag'd old man: I am Jove's messenger, and hither now Have hied me at his bidding: therefore is it More fitting, they should clear the way for me. My father calls, I follow him, and pay Attention to his orders: I'm to him, Such as a good son should be to his father. I second his amours, encourage him, Assist him, counsel him, rejoice with him: If any thing's a pleasure to my father, The pleasure is to me the greater far. He loves, and he is wise; and he does right, When he persues the bent of his desire; Which all men should, in a legitimate way.— Now would he have Amphitryon play'd upon:— I'll do it rarely,—here before your eyes, E'en now.—I'll place a chaplet on my head, And sham the drunkard, get me up above, And drive him hence, this husband, with a vengeance. As soon as he approaches, from above I'll give him such a sluicing, ye shall say, He's sober, yet in liquor. Sosia then Will suffer for't, accus'd of having done What I shall do.—But what is that to me? It is my duty to obey my father, And be subservient to his will and pleasure.— But lo! Amphitryon comes.—Now, if you'll lend Attention, ye shall see him bravely fool'd.— I'll in, and strait equip me for my part, Then to the house-top, and thence drive him off. [Mercury goes in. SCENE II. Enter AMPHITRYON. This Naucrates, whom I did wish to meet, Was not on board; nor found I any one, At home, or in the city, that had seen him. I've crawl'd through ev'ry street, been at the ridinghouse, At the perfumers, the exchange, the market, The wrestling ring, the forum, at the barbers, Th'apothecaries shops, at all the temples.— I'm tir'd with searching;—no where can I find him.— I'll now go home, and of my wife proceed To make enquiry,—who 'twas, for whose sake She gave her body up to prostitution; For it were better I were dead than leave This search unfinish'd. (Going to the door, finds it shut.) They have bar'd the door! 'Tis very fine!—just like their other doings!— But I'll make bold to knock, and soundly too. (knocks) Open the door—Hola there—Who's within? Open the door, I say—Will no one open? SCENE III. MERCURY appears above, with a Chaplet on his Head, pretending to be drunk. Merc. Who's at the door? Amph. 'Tis I. Merc. I? who is I? Amph. 'Tis I, I tell you. Merc. Jove and all the Gods Owe you a spite, you bang so at the door. Amph. How? Merc. How?—that you may live a wretch for ever. Amph. Sosia. Merc. Ay, I am Sosia:—you don't think That I've forgot my name?—What is't you want? Amph. Ask what I want, you villain? Merc. Yes, you fool! You've almost tore our door here off it's hinges: Think you we're furnish'd at the publick charge With doors?—You numscull! why d'ye stare so at me? What would you have?—Who are you? Amph. You whipt knave, D'ye ask me who I am?—You hell of elm-rods! I'll make you burn with smart beneath the scourge For these affronts. Merc. Why sure you must have been A spendthrift in your youth. Amph. For why? Merc. Because In your old age you beg a choke-pear of me. Amph. Slave! I will have you tortur'd for this language. Merc. I sacrifice to you. Amph. How?—what d'ye mean? Merc. I offer a libation of ill luck. (Throwing water.) [What follows is supplied by another hand, the original being lost.] Amph. Is this your off'ring, rascal?—If the Gods Preserve me what I am, your back shall bend With many a leathern thong, laid heavy on it; Victim of Saturn!—Yes—I'll sacrifice you— With torture on the gallows.—Come you out, You hang-dog.— Merc. Apparition!—What, you think To fright me with your threats?—But if you don't Take to your heels, if you dare knock, or touch Our door here even with your little finger, I'll beat about your pate so with this tile, You'll sputter tongue and teeth out all together. Amph. You rascal! wo'n't you suffer me to come Into my own house? knock at my own door?— I'll pluck it off the hinges. (Beating vehemently.) Merc. You persist? Amph. I do. Merc. Take this then. (Throwing a tile.) Amph. Villain! at your master? If I but catch you, to such misery I will reduce you, you shall live a wretch For evermore. Merc. You've play'd the Bacchanalian, Old grey-beard. Amph. Why? Merc. To think I am your slave! Amph. Not think it? Merc. Plague confound you! for I own No master but Amphitryon. Amph. Have I lost My form?—'Tis strange that Sosia should not know me! I'll make a further tryal.—Hola! tell me, Whom do I seem? is't plain I am Amphitryon? Merc. Amphitryon?—Are you mad?—I told you, dotard, That you had play'd the Bacchanalian, To ask another, who you are!—But go, Go, I advise you, and make no disturbance:— Amphitryon is return'd, and is at rest A-bed now with his wife. Amph. What wife? Merc. Alcmena. Amph. Who is? Merc. How often would you have me tell you? Amphitryon my master.—Don't be troublesome. Amph. Who is he with? Merc. Beware you do not seek Your own mischance in trifling with me thus. Amph. Nay prithee tell me, my good Sosia, do. Merc. Now you bespeak me fairly!—with Alcmena. Amph. In the same chamber? Merc. The same chamber,—yes, And the same bed too. Amph. O I am most wretched! Merc. (Aside.) What he counts loss, is gain.—To lend one's wife, Is to let out a barren land for ploughing. Amph. Sosia! Merc. Well—what a plague now would you have With Sosia,—Sosia? Amph. Don't you know me, sirrah? Merc. I know you for a wrangling saucy fellow. Amph. Yet once more,—tell me,—am I not Amphitryon, Your master? Merc. You are Bacchus,—not Amphitryon. How often would you have me tell it you?— Must I repeat it?—Our Amphitryon's here, And hugging his sweet spouse.—If you persist, I'll bring him hither,—to your cost I warrant you. Amph. I would that you would call him here.—Pray heav'n, (Aside.) I may not lose for my good services My country, house, wife, family, and Myself! Merc. I'll call him!—But mean while get from the door.— The sacrifice is ended, I suppose, And now to dinner.—Prithee don't disturb us,— Or I will make a sacrifice of you. [Mercury withdraws. Amph. Ye Gods! what madness has possess'd our house! What wonders have I seen since my arrival!— Now do I hold those fabulous tales for true, Which I have heard of old, that Attic men Were in Arcadia turn'd to savage beasts, So that their friends could never know them after. SCENE IV. Enter BLEPHARO and SOSIA at a Distance. Bleph. How, Sosia!—'Tis most strange what you relate. You found at home another Sosia, say you, Resembling you? Sos. I did, I say.—But hearkye, Since I myself have spawn'd another Sosia, Amphitryon an Amphitryon, how d'ye know, But you too peradventure may engender Another Blepharo? Would to heav'n, that you Were thump'd and bruis'd, your teeth knock'd out, and kept Without a dinner; then you might believe me: For I, that other Sosia, who am yonder, Maul'd me most grievously. Bleph. 'Tis wondrous strange! But we must mend our pace; for, as I see, Amphitryon's waiting, and my empty guts Begin to grumble. Amph. (To himself.) Wherefore should I talk Of foreign legends, when they tales recount More wondrous of the Founder of our Thebes? This mighty searcher of Europa lost, Having subdued the Mars-engender'd beast, Rais'd on the spot a troop of armed men By sowing of the serpent's teeth:—these parted, And 'twixt the two bands a dread fight ensued; With spear and helmet brother press'd on brother. Nor is this all. Epirus has beheld The author of our race together with His spouse Hermione, fair Venus' daughter, Creep in the form of serpents. Jove supreme Did thus ordain from high, thus will'd the Fates. All, all the noblest chieftains of our house Have for their bright atchievements been persued With dire afflictions; and the same sad fate Now presses me:—yet could I stand it's force, And suffer miseries scarce to be endur'd, Were but Alcmena honest. Sos. Blepharo! Bleph. What? Sos. I fear there's some mischance or other. Bleph. Why? Sos. Look you,—our door is shut, and there's my master Sauntering before it, like an humble courtier Waiting to bid good-morrow. Bleph. Poh! that's nothing:— He's walking only for an appetite. Sos. A curious thought indeed!—to shut the door, Lest it should come too early. Bleph. Cease your yelping, You puppy you. Sos. I neither yelp nor bark. If you'll be rul'd by me, pray let's observe him: Something he's musing on, I know not what: He's reckoning some account methinks: I here Can over-hear him.—Don't be in an hurry. Amph. O how I fear me, lest the Gods should rase The glory I have gain'd in vanquishing Our foes the Teleboans! All our family I find in strange confusion and disorder: My wife too!—O she kills me, she's so full Of stain, of prostitution, and dishonour.— But I do marvel much about the cup; For yet the seal was whole.—What shall I say? She told me the particulars of the fight, And how king Pterelas I bravely slew With my own hand.—Oh, now I know the trick! 'Tis Sosia's doing, who has had the impudence To get before me here. Sos. He talks of me, And little to my liking.—I beseech you, Don't let us face him, till he has discover'd What 'tis broils in his stomach. Bleph. As you will. Amph. If I but lay hold on him,—a whipt slave! I'll teach him what it is with tricks and threats To put upon a master. Sos. Do you hear him? Bleph. Yes, very plain. Sos. The burthen on't will light Upon my shoulders.—Prithee let's accost him.— Do you not know the saying?— Bleph. Troth I know not What you'll be saying, but I shrewdly guess What you'll be suffering.— Sos. An old proverb—“Hunger “And a slack guest breeds anger.” Bleph. By my faith A true one. Let's accost him then directly.— Amphitryon! Amph. Sure 'tis Blepharo's voice I hear. I wonder wherefore he should come to me! He comes though opportunely to assist In proving my wife's baseness.—Blepharo! What brings you hither? Bleph. How! have you forgot So soon your sending Sosia to the ship This morning, to invite me here to dinner? Amph. I never did. But where's the villain? Bleph. Who? Amph. Sosia. Bleph. Behold him. Amph. Where? Bleph. Before your eyes. There—don't you see? Amph. I can scarce see for anger. The rascal has distracted me.—(to Sosia.) Don't think Thou shalt escape—I'll sacrifice thee,—villain! (Offering to strike Sosia, Blepharo holds him.) Suffer me, Blepharo. Bleph. Hear me, I beseech you. Amph. What is it? Speak, I hear you.—There—take that. (To Sosia, striking him.) Sos. And wherefore do you strike me? Am I not Come time enough? I could not have gone quicker, If I had borne me on the wings of Dædalus. (Amphitryon offers to strike Sosia again.) Bleph. Hold, I beseech you. 'Twas not in our power To come a quicker pace, believe me. Amph. Whether He strode on stilts, or crept with tortoise speed, I am resolv'd to be his death,—a villain! (Striking him at every sentence.) This for the tiles!—this for the house-top!—this For barring of the door!—this for your making Sport of your master!—this for your foul language! Bleph. What harm pray has he done you? Amph. Done, d'ye ask? He shut the door against me, from the house-top Pelted and drove me off with tiles. Sos. What, I? Amph. What did you threaten you would do, if I But touch'd the door?—Can you deny it, villain? Sos. Why not? Here's ample witness, he I'm come with, Whom I was sent with speed t'invite to dinner. Amph. Who sent you, rascal? Sos. He that asks the question. Amph. Ha! when? Sos. Just now,—lately,—a moment since,— When you was reconcil'd here with your lady. Amph. Bacchus has turn'd your head. Sos. May I not see Bacchus to-day, nor Ceres!—You gave orders The vessels should be clean'd, that you might make A sacrifice, and sent me to invite Him here to dinner. Amph. Blepharo, let me dye, If I have been within yet, or e'er sent him.— Where did you leave me? Speak. Sos. At your own house, And with my lady,—when I parted from you, Flew to the port, and in your name invited Blepharo here to dinner.—We are come,— I never saw you after till this instant. Amph. How! villain, with my wife?—You shall not hence Without a drubbing. (Strikes him.) Sos. Blepharo! Bleph. (interfering) Good Amphitryon, Let him alone now for my sake, and hear me. Amph. Well—speak your pleasure. Bleph. He has lately told me Of things most strange.—Some juggler peradventure Or sorcerer has enchanted all your family. Enquire into it, see what it can be, And do not torture this poor wretch, untill You've learn'd the truth. Amph. You counsel me aright: Let's in: I'd have you for an advocate Against my wife. [They move towards the door. SCENE V. Enter JUPITER. Jup. Who is it with such vast And vehement bangs hath almost shook our door From off it's hinges? Who is it hath rais'd Such foul disturbance for so long a time Before the house? Whom if I once can find, By Jove I'll sacrifice him to the souls Of slaughter'd Teleboans.—Nothing now Speeds, as they say, right with me. I left Blepharo And Sosia to go seek my kinsman Naucrates: Them I have lost, and him I have not found. Sos. Blepharo! That's my master, just come out; But This here is the sorcerer. Bleph. O Jupiter! What do I see? This is not, but That is Amphitryon; or if This be he, That cannot; Except indeed he's double. Jup. See—here's Sosia And Blepharo with him: I'll accost them first. So, are you come at last?—I dye with hunger. Sos. Did not I say, this other was the sorcerer? (Pointing to Amphitryon.) Amph. That is the sorcerer, my fellow Thebans, Who has seduc'd my wife, and stor'd my house With shame and prostitution. Sos. (To Jup.) My good master, You may be hungry, for my part I've had My belly-full of cuffs. Amph. Still prating, rascal? Sos. Hie thee to Acheron, thou damned sorcerer! Amph. Ha!—dost thou call me sorcerer?—Then have at thee. (Strikes him.) Jup. Stranger! what wild distemperature is this, That you should strike my servant? Amph. Thine? Jup. Yes, mine. Amph. Thou liest. Jup. Sosia, go in, and see the dinner Got ready, whilst I sacrifice this fellow. Sos. I'll go.—Amphitryon will, as I suppose, Receive Amphitryon with like courtesy As I, the other Sosia, did receive Me Sosia.—In the mean time, while they're squabbling, I'll to the kitchen, there lick all the platters, And empty all the cups. [Exit Sosia. SCENE VI. Remain JUPITER, AMPHITRYON, and BLEPHARO. Jup. Say'st thou, I lie? Amph. Thou liest, I say,—corrupter of my family! Jup. Now for these scurvy terms I'll throttle thee. (Takes him by the collar.) Amph. Oh, Oh! Jup. You should have look'd to this before. Amph. Help, Blepharo! Bleph. They are both so like each other, I know not which to side with; but I'll try To finish their contention, if I can.— Amphitryon, do not kill Amphitryon: pray Let go his collar. Jup. Call'st thou Him Amphitryon? Bleph. Why not? He was but one, but now he's double. What though you say you are, the other too Is still Amphitryon in his form. Then pray Let go his collar. Jup. Well;—but tell me truly, Does he appear to you to be Amphitryon? Bleph. Both verily. Amph. O highest Jupiter! When did you take away this form of mine?— But I'll examine him.—Art thou Amphitryon? Jup. Dost thou deny it? Amph. Surely, since there is No other of that name in Thebes but I. Jup. No, none but I:—then, Blepharo, be thou judge Betwixt us. Bleph. I will make this matter clear By tokens, if I can. (to Amph.) You answer first. Amph. Most willingly. Bleph. What orders did you give me, Ere you began the battle with the Taphians? Amph. To hold the ship in readiness, and stick Close to the rudder. Jup. That in case our troops Were routed, I might find a safe retreat. Amph. And for another reason:—to secure The bag, well loaded with a store of treasure. Jup. What money was there? Bleph. Hold, you:—'tis for me To put the question. (To Jupiter) Do you know the sum? Jup. Yes, fifty Attic talents. Bleph. To a jot. And you—(to Amph.) how many Philippeans were there? Amph. Two thousand.— Jup. And of Oboli twice as many. Bleph. Both hit the mark so truly, one of them Must needs have hid him in the bag. Jup. Attend. With this right arm, (as you are not to learn,) I slew king Pterelas; seiz'd on the spoils, And in a casket brought the golden cup, Which he was wont to drink from: This I gave A present to my wife, with whom to-day I bath'd, I sacrific'd, I lay. Amph. Ah me! What do I hear?—I scarcely am myself! Awake I sleep; awake I dream; alive, In health, and in my perfect mind, I perish. I am Amphitryon, nephew of Gorgophone, Commander of the Thebans, favourite Of Creon, conqueror of the Teleboans, Who vanquish'd with his might the Acarnanians, And Taphians, by his warlike prowess slew Their monarch, and appointed Cephalus Their governor, son of Dëioneus. Jup. I by my bravery in the battle crush'd Those hostile ravagers, that had destroy'd Electryon, and the brothers of our wife. These wand'ring through th'Ionian, the Ægean, And Cretan seas, with pow'r piratical Laid waste Achaia, Phocis, and Ætolia. Amph. O ye immortal Gods! I scarce can have Faith in myself, so just is his relation.— What say you, Blepharo? Bleph. One thing yet remains: If that appear, be double,—both Amphitryons Jup. I know what you would say; that scar you mean Upon my right arm from the wound by Pterelas Deeply intrench'd. Bleph. The same. Amph. Well thought on. Jup. See you? Lo! look! Bleph. Uncover, and I'll look. Jup. We have Uncover'd: look! (They both shew their arms.) Bleph. O Jupiter supreme! What do I see?—On both of you most plainly, Upon the right arm, in the self-same place, The self-same token does appear,—a scar, New closing, of a reddish wannish hue! All reasoning fails, and judgment is struck dumb. I know not what to do. [Here ends the supposititious part.] Between yourselves You must decide it: I must hence away; I've business calls me.—Never did I see Such wonders! Amph. I beseech you, Blepharo, stay, And be my advocate; pray do not go. Bleph. Farewell.—An advocate how can I be, Who know not which to side with? Jup. I'll go in: Alcmena is in labour. [Blepharo goes off, and Jupiter goes into Amphitryon's house. SCENE VI. AMPHITRYON alone. Woe is me! What shall I do, abandon'd by my friends, And now without an advocate to help me?— Yet shall he ne'er abuse me unreveng'd, Whoe'er he is.—I'll strait unto the king, And lay the whole before him.—I'll have vengeance On this damn'd sorcerer, who has strangely turn'd The minds of all our family.—But where is he?— I doubt not, but he's gone in to my wife.— Lives there in Thebes a greater wretch than I?— What shall I do now, since all men deny me, And fool me at their pleasure?—'Tis resolv'd: I'll burst into the house, and whomsoe'er I set my eyes on, servant male or female, Wife or gallant, father or grandfather, I'll cut them into pieces:—Nor shall Jove, Nor all the Gods prevent it, if they would, But I will do what I've resolv'd.—I'll in now. [As he advances towards the door, it thunders, and he falls down. Thunder and Lightning. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter BROMIA, AMPHITRYON continuing in a swoon. Brom. I have no means of safety left; my hopes Lye in my breast extinct and buried; I Have lost all confidence of heart and spirit; Since all things seem combin'd, sea, earth and heav'n, T'oppress and to destroy me.—I am wretched!— I know not what to do, such prodigies Have been display'd within!—Ah, woe is me! I'm sick at heart now,—would I had some water,— I faint, my head aches,—I don't hear, nor see Well with my eyes.—Ah me! no woman sure Was e'er so wretched, an event so strange Has happen'd to my mistress!—When she found Herself in labour, she invok'd the Gods:— Then what a rumbling, grumbling, flashing, clashing, Straitway ensued! how suddenly, how quick, How terribly it thunder'd! All that stood Fell flat down at the noise: and then we heard Some one, I know not who, with mighty voice Cry out, “Alcmena, succour is at hand: “Be not dismay'd: the heav'n's high ruler comes “To you propitious and to yours. Arise, “(Says he,) ye who have fallen through the terror “And dread of me.”—I rose from where I lay, And such a brightness stream'd through all the house, Methought it was in flames. Then presently Alcmena call'd me, which afflicted me With horror; for I fear'd much more for her Than for myself: I ran to her in haste, To know what she might want, and (bless my eyes!) Saw she had been deliver'd of two boys; Nor any of us knew, or did suspect, When she was thus deliver'd.—But what's this? Who is this old man, stretch'd before our house? Has he been thunder-stricken? I believe so: For he is laid out as if dead: I'll go, And learn who 'tis.—(Advancing to Amph.) 'Tis certainly Amphitryon, My master.—Hoa, Amphitryon! Amph. I am dead. Brom. Come, rise, Sir. Amph. I'm quite dead. Brom. Give me your hand. Amph. (recovering.) Who is it holds me? Brom. I, your maid, Sir, Bromia. Amph. I tremble every joint, with such amaze Has Jupiter appall'd me! and I seem, As though I were just risen from the dead. But wherefore came you forth? Brom. The same dread fear Fill'd us poor souls with horror. I have seen, Ah me! such wondrous prodigies within, I scarce am in my senses. Amph. Prithee tell me, D'ye know me for your master, for Amphitryon? Brom. Yes, surely. Amph. Look again now. Brom. I well know you. Amph. She is the only person of our family, That is not mad. Brom. Nay verily they all Are in their perfect senses. Amph. But my wife By her foul deeds has driv'n me to distraction. Brom. But I shall make you change your language, Sir, And own your wife a chaste one; on which point I will convince you in few words. Know first, Alcmena is deliver'd of two boys. Amph. How say you, two? Brom. Yes, two. Amph. The Gods preserve me! Brom. Permit me to go on, that you may know, How all the Gods to you are most propitious And to your wife. Amph. Speak. Brom. When your spouse began To be in labour, and the wonted pangs Of child-birth came upon her, she invok'd Th'immortal gods to aid her, with wash'd hands, And cover'd head; then presently it thunder'd, And with a crack so loud, we thought at first The house itself was tumbling, and it shone As bright throughout, as if it were of gold. Amph. Prithee relieve me quickly, since you have Perplex'd me full enough.—What follow'd after? Brom. Mean time, while this was done, not one of us Or heard your wife once groan, or once complain; She was deliver'd ev'n without a pang. Amph. That joys me, I confess, however little She merits at my hands. Brom. Leave that, and hear What more I have to say. After delivery She bade us wash the boys: we set about it: But he that I wash'd, O how sturdy is he! So strong and stout withal, not one of us Could bind him in his swadling-cloaths. Amph. 'Tis wondrous What you relate: if your account be true, I doubt not but Alcmena has been favour'd With large assistance and support from heaven. Brom. You'll say what follows is more wondrous still. After the boy was in his cradle laid, Two monstrous serpents with high-lifted crests Slid down the sky-light: in an instant both Rear'd up their heads. Amph. Ah me! Brom. Be not dismay'd. The serpents cast their eyes around on all, And, after they had spied the children out, With quickest motion made towards the cradle, I, fearing for the boys, and for myself, Drew back the cradle, stir'd it to and fro, Backwards and forwards, on one side and t'other: The more I work'd it, by so much the more These serpents fierce persued. That other boy, Soon as he spied the monsters, in an instant Leaps him from out the cradle, strait darts at them, And suddenly he seizes upon both, In each hand grasping one. Amph. The tale you tell Is fraught with many wonders, and the deed That you relate is all too terrible; For horror at your words creeps thro' my limbs.— What happen'd next? Proceed now in your story. Brom. The child kill'd both the serpents. During this A loud voice calls upon your wife— Amph. Who calls? Brom. Jove, supreme sovereign of Gods and men. He own'd that he had secretly enjoy'd Alcmena, that the boy, who slew the serpents, Was his, the other he declar'd was your's. Amph. I now repent me, an' it pleases him, To share a part with Jove in any good. Go home, and see the vessels be prepar'd For sacrifice forthwith, that I may make My peace with Jove, by offering many victims. [Bromia goes in. I'll to the soothsayer Tiresias, and Consult with him what's fittest to be done: I'll tell him what has happen'd.—But what's this?— How dreadfully it thunders!—Mercy on us! SCENE II. JUPITER appears above. [Thunder and Lightning.] Be of good cheer, Amphitryon; I am come To comfort and assist you and your family. Nothing you have to fear; then let alone All sooth-sayers and diviners: I'll inform you Of what is past, and what is yet to come, Much better than they can, since I am Jove. Know first of all, I have enjoy'd Alcmena, Whence she was pregnant by me with a son: You likewise left her pregnant, when you went To th'army. At one birth two boys together She has brought forth: the one, sprung from my loins, Shall gain immortal glory by his deeds. Restore Alcmena to your ancient love: In nothing does she merit your reproaches: She was compell'd by my resistless power, To what she did.—I now return to heav'n. [Jupiter ascends. SCENE the Last. AMPHITRYON alone. I'll do, as you command; and I beseech you, That you would keep your promises.—I'll in Unto my wife, and think no more of old Tiresias!—Now, Spectators, for the sake Of highest Jove give us your loud applause. The End of Amphitryon.</field>
