      <field name="fulltext">THE SELF-TORMENTOR, There is, perhaps, no play of Terence, wherein the Author has pointed out the place and time of action with more exactness than in the present: and yet the settling those two points has occasioned a most furious controversy between two learned Frenchmen, Hedelin and Menage. Madam Dacier, in her remarks, has endeavoured to moderate between them, sometimes inclining to one side, and sometimes to the other. I, perhaps, in my turn, shall occasionally differ from all three, not doubting but I shall become equally liable to the reprehensions of future criticks. I shall however, endeavour to found my remarks on an accurate examination of the piece itself, and to draw my arguments from within rather than from without. The principal cause of the different errors of Hedelin and Menage, seems to me to have been an idle parade of learning, foreign to the purpose; together with an obstinate adherence to their several systems, which having once adopted, they were resolved to square all their arguments to the support of their opinions, rather than to direct them towards the investigation of truth. The matters in dispute between them, though drawn out to a great length of controversy, lie in a very narrow compass. But there being in both an apparent jealousy of their characters as scholars, both were induced to multiply quotations and illustrations from other authors, instead of turning their attention sufficiently to the text, and making the poet a comment on himself; which every writer, especially those who attempt the Drama, ought to be. Each were in some instances wrong; and even when they were in the right, having condescended to maintain their opinion with false arguments, each in their turn afforded the opponent an opportunity of cavilling with some appearance of justice. Many examples of this will, I think, appear in the course of these notes, from which it may be concluded, that there is no point whatever, that lies so plain and level to the understanding, but it may be rendered obscure and intricate by learned and ingenious disputants, who chuse it as a subject for the exercise of their talents and a display of their erudition.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Lest any of you wonder, why the Bard To an old actor hath assigned the part It appears from this passage that the Prologue was usually spoken by young men. Dacier. Sustain'd of old by young performers; Terence has been accused by some criticks of being worse than his word here; for, say they, he does not first explain why he has chosen an old performer. But this accusation is unjust, for it is the first thing which he does: what he says before is merely to make the piece known, which business he dispatches in two words, and that too in a parenthesis. Dacier. This passage is also vindicated by Scaliger in his Poeticks, chap. 3. book 6. That I'll first explain: then say what brings me here. To-day, a whole play, wholly from the Greek, We mean to represent:âThe Self-Tormentor: Wrought from a single to a double plot. Duplex quÃ¦ ex argumento facta est simplici. This passage has greatly perplexed the Commentators. Julius Scaliger was of opinion that Terence called this Comedy Duplex, double, because it was acted at two different times: the two first Acts at the close of the evening, and the remaining three on the following morning; and that it therefore served as two distinct pieces. But this conjecture is not admissible: Terence only meant to say that he had doubled the characters; instead of one old man, one young gallant, one mistress, as in Menander, he had two old men, &amp;c. he therefore adds very properly, novam esse ostendi,âThat our Comedy is New,âwhich certainly could not have been implied, had the characters been the same in the Greek poet. Dacier. Now therefore that our Comedy is new, Terence pretends, that having doubled the subject of the Self-Tormentor, his piece is new. I allow it; but whether it is better on that account, is quite another question. Diderot. It is impossible not to regret that there are not above ten lines of the Self-Tormentor preserved among the Fragments of Menander. We are so deeply interested by what we see of that character in Terence, that one cannot but be curious to enquire in what manner the Greek Poet sustained it through five acts. The Roman Author, though he has adopted the title of the Greek Play, has so altered the fable, that Menedemus is soon thrown into the back-ground, and Chremes is brought forward as the principal object: or, to vary the allusion a little, the Menedemus of Terence seems to be a drawing in miniature copied from a full length, as large as the life, by Menander. And what it is, I've shewn: who wrote it too, And whose in Greek it is, were I not sure This is a remarkable proof how careful the Romans were in the study of the Greek Poets. S. Most of you knew already, would I tell. But, wherefore I have ta'en this part upon me, In brief I will deliver: for the Bard Has sent me here as Pleader, not as Prologue: You he declares his Judges, me his Counsel: And yet as Counsel nothing can I speak More than the Author teaches me to say, Who wrote th'oration which I now recite. As to reports, which envious men have spread, That he has ransack'd many Grecian plays, While he composes some few Latin ones, That he denies not, he has done; nor does Repent he did it; means to do it still; Safe in the warrant and authority Of greater bards, who did long since the same. Then for the charge, that his Arch-Enemy Maliciously reproaches him withal, That he but lately hath applied himself The Ancients called that Musick, which we now term the Belles Lettres. Aristophanes more than once calls the art of dramatick writing, Musick. Dacier. To musick, with the genius of his friends, Rather than natural talents, fraught; how true, Your judgment, your opinion, must decide. I would intreat you, therefore, not to lean To tales of slander, rather than of candour. Be favourable; nurse with growing hopes The bards, who give you pleasing novelties; Pleasing I say, not such as His I mean, It must have been a very wretched piece, if this was the most beautiful passage in it. Yet such an incident is often necessary, as may be seen in the Amphitryon of Plautus, where Mercury runs in crying, Concedite atque abscedite, omnes de viÃ¢ decedite. Terence therefore only blames those authors, who, like Luscius, made it the capital circumstance in their plays. Dacier. Had Madam Dacier quoted the whole passage in the Amphitryon, I think, it would have been evident that Plautus also meant to ridicule the like practice. Concedite atque abscedite, omnes de viÃ¢ decedite, Nec quisquam tam audax fuat homo, qui obviam insistat mihi! Nam mihi quidem, hercle, quÃ­ minus liceat Deo minitarier Populo, ni decedat mihi, quam servulo in ComÃ¦diis? Plaut, Amph. Act 2. Sc. 4. Give place, make room, and clear the way before me, Nor any be so bold to stop my speed! For shall not I, who am a Deity, Menace the croud, unless they yield to me, As well as Slaves in Comedy? Who lately introduc'd a breathless slave, Making the croud give way:âBut wherefore trace A dunce's faults? which shall be shewn at large, When more he writes, unless he cease to rail. Attend impartially! and let me once Without annoyance act an easy part; Statariam agere. The word Statariam has not not been thoroughly understood; in order more fully to explain it, we must have recourse to its original meaning. The Greek Poets divided their choruses into two different sorts of verse, the ??????? ????, statarios versus, so called, because the actor who repeated them never moved from his place; and into the ???????? ????, motorios versus, because the performer skipped and danced about while he was repeating his part. This has been perfectly well explained by the Scholiasts upon Ãschylus and Aristophanes. The Romans made the same distinctions, and called those Pieces StatariÃ¦ which were grave and composed, and required little or no action. The MotoriÃ¦ on the contrary were lively and full of business and action.âThis Play is of the former kind.âSome Commentators imagine Terence means one character only by Statariam, as if personam were to be understood; though the Ancients did call the actors statorios et motorios, according to the different parts they were engaged in, I am convinced that it is not in this place at all applicable to them, but to the whole comedy: how else are we to explain the 45th verse. Sin levis est, ad alium mox defertur gregem. To apply it to any one of the other actors of the company, would be overstraining the sense of the text. Dacier. Being entirely of a different opinion from Madam Dacier, concerning the sense of the words Statariam agere, I have translated them as referring merely to the character, which the Prologue-Speaker was to play, (which I apprehend to have been Menedemus) and not to the whole comedy: and the lines immediately subsequent, I think, confirm this interpretation, as they contain a description of the laborious characters he usually represented, Clamore summo, cum labore maxumo; and which he urges as a plea for his being allowed to act an easier part at present. ? date potestatem, mihi Statariam agere, ut liceat per silentium. As to the difficulty started by Madam Dacier of reconciling Sin levis, &amp;c. to the rest of the context, it is a difficulty, which I must own I cannot entirely comprehend. Lest your old servant be o'er-labour'd still With toilsome characters, the running slave, The eating parasite, enrag'd old man, The bold-fac'd sharper, covetous procurer; Parts, that ask pow'rs of voice, and iron sides. Deign then, for my sake, to accept this plea, And grant me some remission from my labour. For they, who now produce new comedies, Spare not my age: If there is aught laborious, They run to me; but if of little weight, Away to others. In our piece to-day Terence with great propriety commends this play for the purity of its stile; he knew it to be very deficient in point of action, and therefore determined to repair that defect by the vivacity and purity of the language; and he has perfectly succeeded. Dacier. Here I have again quoted Madam Dacier merely to express my dissent from her opinion. The play is, in my mind, far from being destitute of action: the plot being as artfully constructed, and containing as many unexpected turns and variety of incidents, as any of our Author's pieces, as may perhaps appear in the course of these notes. The Stile is pure: Now try my talents then In either character. If I for gain, Never o'er-rated my abilities; If I have held it still my chief reward To be subservient to your pleasure; fix In me a fair example, that our youth May seek to please You, rather than Themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. CHREMES, MENEDEMUS. CHREMES. Though our acquaintance is as yet but young, Since you have bought this farm that neighbours mine, And little other commerce is betwixt us; Yet or your virtue, or good neighbourhood, (Which is in my opinion kin to friendship) Urge me to tell you, fairly, openly, That you appear to me to labour more Than your age warrants, or affairs require. Now in the name of heav'n and earth, what is't You want? what seek you? Threescore years of age, Or older, as I guess; with an estate, Better than which, more profitable, none In these parts hold; master of many slaves; As if you had not one at your command, You labour in their offices yourself. I ne'er go out so soon at morn, return So late at eve, but in your grounds I see you Fodere, aut arare, aut aliquid ferre. This passage is of much greater consequence than is generally imagined, towards the understanding the true intent and management of this play; for it is material to know what Menedemus is about when Chremes first accosts him; whether he is at work in the field, or is returning home loaded with his tools. Two very learned men engaged in a very elaborate disputation upon this subject. If Menedemus is still at work when Chremes first meets him, Terence would certainly have been guilty of a very gross impriety in the conduct of his comedy; for, as the scene never changes, Menedemus must necessarily be ever present. Terence could never be so absurd as not to guard against falling into so gross an error. He not only takes care to acquaint us with the situation of Menedemus, but also with the hour of the day, at which the piece commences; which is plainly marked out by these words, aut aliquid ferre, which decides the whole point in question. Menedemus having been at work all day, and being unable to see any longer, takes his tools on his back, and is making the best of his way home; Chremes at that very instant meets him near his own door, where the scene lies: the beginning of this play therefore is evidently towards the close of the day, when Menedemus had quitted his work. Dacier. There is certainly a great want of accuracy in this way of reasoning, with which Madam Dacier espouses Hedelin's argument: for why, as Menage justly says, should the words aut aliquid ferre refer to the manner in which Menedemus was then actually employed, more than the other words, fodere, aut arare? or if they were so interpreted, still they must be applied to his carrying burdens in the course of his laborious occupations, while at work in the fields. One word of marginal direction, setting down the Pantomime of the scene, according to Diderot's plan, would have solved all our doubts on this head. On the whole, Menage, I think, fails in his proofs that Menedemus is actually at work, though he labours that point exceedingly: and Hedelin is manifestly wrong in maintaining that the scene lies within the city of Athens. One of the principal objections urged by Hedelin (and referred to by Madam Dacier in the above note) to the Poet's having intended to exhibit Menedemus actually at work, when Chremes accosts him, is that the scene evidently lies between both their houses. Were the scene laid in town, as Hedelin contends, indeed it could not be: but if in the country adjacent, as Dacier agrees with Menage, why might not Menedemus be at work on a piece of ground lying between the two houses? It is natural enough that the fight of Menedemus thus employed, might urge Chremes to presume, under the privilege of good neighbourhood, to speak to him.âThere is a brevity and sullenness also in the answers of Menedemus, that seems in character for a man employed, and unwilling to be interrupted, though he relents by degrees, and reluctantly suffers Chremes to force his tools from him.âHis being at work too forms a kind of theatrical picture on the opening of the piece.âThese, I think, are the strongest arguments, deduced from the scene itself, which can be urged in behalf of the notion of Menedemus's being exhibited as at work on his farm; and some of them, I think appear weighty and plausible: but a further examination, with an attention to the conduct of the rest of the piece, determined me to the contrary opinion.âAt the end of the scene, it is evident that Menedemus quits the stage, and enters his own house. It cannot be said, that he is prevailed on to desist from his labour by the arguments of Chremes; since he will not even accept the invitation to supper lest it should afford him a respite from his misery. It is plain therefore, I think, that Terence meant to open the first act with the close of the day, together with the labours of Menedemus; as he begins the third act with the break of day and the coming-forth of Menedemus, to return to his toils and self-punishment. The length of this, and some other controversial notes on this comedy, will, I hope, be excused, when it is considered that this dispute has filled whole volumes. I thought it incumbent on me to clear up these points to the best of my abilities; since none can be so justly reproved for having omitted to explain an author's meaning, as those who have attempted to translate him. Dig, plough, or fetch and carry: in a word You ne'er remit your toil, nor spare yourself. This, I am certain, is not done for pleasure. âYou'll say, perhaps, it vexes you to see Your work go on so slowly;âdo but give The time you spend in labouring yourself To set your slaves to work, 'twill profit more. Mene. Have you such leisure from your own affairs To think of those, that don't concern you, Chremes? Chremes. I am a man, and feel for all mankind. Homo sum; humani nihil a me alienum puto. It is said that at the delivery of this sentiment, the whole theatre, though full of foolish and ignorant people, resounded with applause. St. Augustine. It is said this sentence was received with an universal applause. There cannot be a greater argument of the general good understanding of a people, than a sudden consent to give their approbation of a sentiment which has no emotion in it. If it were spoken with never so great skill in the actor, the manner of uttering that sentence could have nothing in it which could strike any but people of the greatest humanity, nay, people elegant and skilful in observations upon it. It is possible he might have laid his hand on his breast, and with a winning insinuation in his countenance, expressed to his neighbour that he was a man who made his case his own: yet I'll engage a player in Covent-Garden might hit such an attitude a thousand times before he would have been regarded. Steele's Spectator, No. 502. We are not to take this, as hath constantly been done, for a sentiment of pure humanity and the natural ebullition of benevolence. We may observe in it a designed stroke of satirical resentment. The Self-Tormentor, as we saw, had ridiculed Chremes' curiosity by a severe reproof. Chremes, to be even with him, reflects upon the inhumanity of his temper. âYou, says he [or rather he implies] seem such a foe to humanity, that you spare it not in yourself; I, on the other hand, am affected when I see it suffer in another.â Hurd's Dissertation on the Provinces of the Drama. I cannot dismiss this long note without expressing my concurrence with the last cited critick in his explanation of this passage: but I cannot agree with Sir Richard Steele that sentiments of humanity are suffered to pass unnoticed on our Theatres, any more than I can conclude with the pious St. Augustine, that the Roman theatre was filled with foolish and ignorant people. A modern audience seems to be on the catch for sentiment; and perhaps often injudiciously: for nothing can be more opposite to the genius of the Drama, whether in Tragedy or Comedy, than a forced detail of sentiments, unless, like this before us, they grow out of the circumstances of the play, and fall naturally from the character that delivers them. The original contains a play of words between homo and humani, and a retort of the word alienum, which makes it rather difficult to be given with its full force in a translation. My version, I am conscious, does not comprehend every word; but I hope it will be found to include the whole meaning of the sentiment. It is easy to open it still further by a more diffused expression; but I thought that conciseness made it more round, and full, and forcible. If there are any readers of a different opinion, let them substitute the two following lines; though I must own I prefer that in the text. I am a man; and all calamities, That touch humanity, come home to me. Think, I advise, or ask for information: If right, that I may do the same; if wrong, To turn you from it. Mene. I have need to do thus. Do you as you think fit. Chremes. Need any man Torment himself? Mene. I need. Comedy relates to the whole species, Tragedy to individuals. What I mean is this, the heroe of the Tragedy is such or such a man; Regulus, or Brutus, or Cato, and no other person. The principal character of a Comedy, should on the contrary represent a great number of men. If by chance the Poet should give him so peculiar a physiognomy, that there were in society but one individual who resembled him, Comedy would relapse into its childhood, and degenerate into satire. Terence seems to me to have fallen once into this error. His Self-Tormentor is a father afflicted at the extremities to which he has driven his son by an excess of severity; for which he punishes himself by rags, hard fare, avoiding company, putting away his servants, and condemning himself to labour the earth with his own hands. One may venture to pronounce such a father to be out of nature. A great city would scarce in an age furnish one example of so whimsical a distress. Horace, whose taste was of a singular delicacy, appears to me to have perceived this fault, and to have glanced at it in the following passage. Hic? vix credere possis Quam sibi non sit amicus: ita ut pater ille, Terenti Fabula quem miserum nato vixisse fugato Inducit, non se pejus cruciaverit atque hic. Noâ'tis amazing, that this man of pelf, Hath yet so little friendship for himself, That ev'n the Self-Tormentor in the play, Cruel, who drove his much-lov'd son away, Amidst the willing tortures of despair, Could not, with wretchedness like his, compare. Francis. Nothing is more in the manner of this poet, than to have given two senses to pejus, one of which is aimed at Terence, and the other falls on Fufidius, the immediate object of his satire. Diderot. Perhaps the reader will imagine the latter part of the above note, relative to Horace, is rather a refinement of the ingenious critick, than the real intention of the satirist. Chremes. If there's a cause, Si quid laboris est, nollem. This passage has not been rightly understood. After Menedemus tells Chremes that he is resolved to torment himself, Chremes unable to account for so extraordinary and whimsical a humour in his neighbour, says, si quid laboris est, nollem, and means to be understood to proceed with te deterrere. Something very shocking, even bordering upon desperation, must have happened, to give Menedemus cause to behave in this manner, and this obliges Chremes to be so pressing with his neighbour to quit this toilsome and fatiguing work, and the rather as it would in a great measure contribute towards his forgetting the cause of all his troublesâa piece of complaisance and politeness, which I have always been charmed with. Dacier. I'd not oppose it. But what evil's this? What is th'offence so grievous to your nature, That asks such cruel vengeance on yourself? Mene. Alas! alas! [in tears. Chremes. Nay, weep not; but inform me. Be not reserv'd: fear nothing: prithee, trust me: By consolation, counsel, or assistance, I possibly may serve you. Mene. Would you know it? Chremes. Ay, for the very reason I have mention'd. Mene. I will inform you. Chremes. But meanwhile lay down Those rakes: don't tire yourself. Mene. It must not be. Chremes. What mean you? Mene. Give me leave: that I may take No respite from my toil. Chremes. I'll not allow it. [taking away the rakes. Mene. Ah, you do wrong. Chremes. What, and so heavy too! [weighing them in his hand. Mene. Such my desert. Chremes. Now speak. [laying down the rakes. Mene. One only son I have.âHave did I say?âHad I mean, Chremes. Have I or no, is now uncertain. Chremes. Wherefore? Mene. That you shall know. An old Corinthian woman Now sojourns here, a stranger in these parts, And very poor. It happen'd, of her daughter My son became distractedly enamour'd;â E'en to the brink of marriage; and all this Unknown to me: which I no sooner learnt Than I began to deal severely with him, Not as a young and love-sick mind requir'd, But in the rough and usual way of fathers. Daily I child him; crying, âHow now, Sir! âThink you that you shall hold these courses long, âAnd I your father living?âKeep a mistress, âAs if she were your wife!âYou are deceiv'd, âIf you think that, and do not know me, Clinia. âWhile you act worthily, you're mine; if not, âI shall act towards you worthy of myself. âAll this arises from mere idleness. âI, at your age, ne'er thought of love; but went âTo seek my fortune in the wars in Asia, âAnd there acquir'd in arms both wealth and glory.â âIn short things came to such a pass, the youth, O'ercome with hearing still the self-same thing, And wearied out with my reproaches; thinking, Age and experience had enabled me To judge his int'rest better than himself, Went off to serve the king in Asia, Chremes. Chremes. How say you? Mene. Stole away three months ago, Without my knowledge. Chremes. Both have been to blame: And yet this enterprize bespeaks a mind, Modest and manly. Mene. Having heard of this From some of his familiars, home I came Mournful, half-mad, and almost wild with grief. I sit me down; my servants run to me; Some draw my sandals off; while others haste It will not be improper to say something here of the antient manner of eating among the Greeks and Romans: they sat, or rather lay, in an accumbent posture: the beds or couches, on which they lay, were round the table, which was raised but a little from the ground. Cooke. To spread the couches, and prepare the supper: Each in his way, I mark, does all he can To mitigate my sorrow. Noting this, âHow, said I to myself, so many then âAnxious for me alone? to pleasure me? âSo many slaves to dress me? The better sort of people had eating-dresses, which are here alluded to. These dresses were light garments to put on as soon as they had bathed. They commonly bathed before eating; and the chief meal was in the evening. Cooke. All this cost âFor me alone?âMean while, my only son, âFor whom all these were fit, as well as me, âNay rather more, since he is of an age âMore proper for their use; him, him, poor boy, âHas my unkindness driven forth to sorrow. âOh I were worthy of the heaviest curse, âCould I brook that!âNo; long as he shall lead âA life of penury abroad, an exile âThrough my unjust severity, so long âWill I revenge his wrongs upon myself, âLabouring, scraping, sparing, slaving for him.â âIn short I did so; in the house I left Nor Nec vas, nec vestimentum,âancillas, &amp;c. Among the fragments of Menander's Heautontimorumenos, is a line much to this purpose. ???????, ??????????, ??????????. The bath, maid-servants, silver-utensils. There are also two other lines, which seem to be descriptive of the miseries of being driven into exile. ????? ??????, ??? ?????? ?????????, ? ????? ?????, ??? ????? ?????????. Let him remain at home, and free remain, Or cease to be, who wou'd be truly blest! May we not conjecture from these passages, that this first scene is a pretty close translation from Menander; especially as it contains no part of the fable, but what is merely relative to the Self-Tormentor, which, we know, occupied the whole play in the Greek poet? cloaths, nor moveables; I scrap'd up all. My slaves, both male and female, except those Who more than earn'd their bread in country-work, I sold: Then set my house to sale: Inscripsi illicÃ² Ã¦des.âIt appears by this, that the Greeks and Romans used to fix bills on their doors, as we do now.âÃdes vendundÃ¦ Ã¦des locandÃ¦, a house to be sold, a house to be let. Patrick. In all I got together about fifteen talents; A talent, according to Cooke, was equal to 1931. 15s. English money. Purchas'd this farm; and here fatigue myself; Thinking I do my son less injury, There is much resemblance between this character of Menedemus, and that of Laertes in the Odyssey. Laertes, unhappy and afflicted at the absence of his son, is under the same trouble and anxiety. Thy Sire in solitude foments his care: The Court is joyless, for thou art not there, &amp;c. Pope's Odyssey, Book XI. V. 226. Laertes lives, the miserable Sire, Lives, but implores of ev'ry pow'r to lay The burden down, and wishes for the day. Torn from his offspring in the eve of life, &amp;c. Book XV. V. 375. But old Laertes weeps his life away, And deems thee lostâ The mournful hour that tore his son away Send the sad sire in solitude to stray; Yet busied with his slaves, to ease his woe, He drest the vine, and bad the garden blow, &amp;c. Book XVI. V. 145. While I'm in mis'ry too; nor is it just For me, I think, to taste of pleasure here, Till he return in safety to partake on't. Chremes. You I believe a tender parent, him A duteous son, if govern'd prudently. But you was unacquainted with his nature, And he with your's: sad life, where things are so! You ne'er betray'd your tenderness to him; Nor durst he place that confidence in you, Which well becomes the bosom of a father. Had that been done, this had not happen'd to you. Mene. True, I confess: but I was most in fault. Chremes. All, Menedemus, will, I hope, be well, And trust, your son will soon return in safety. Mene. Grant it, good Gods! Chremes. They will. Now, therefore, since The Athenians celebrated several feasts in honour of Bacchus, but there were two principal ones; one kept in the Spring, the other in the Autumn season. The AbbÃ© d'Aubignac [Hedelin] has been very minute in his account of these feasts, and yet after all has unhappily pitched upon the wrong one; for he thinks the feast Terence is now speaking of, was that held in the Spring season, called by the ancients Anthesteria, where he also places that called the Pythoigia, because they then broached the wine casks; and he grounds his opinion upon line the 50th, of the first scene in the third act. Relevi omnia dolia, omnes serias. I have pierc'd ev'ry vessel, ev'ry cask. But this manner of reasoning is by no means conclusive; for, could they not have done just the self-same thing at any other time of the year? And in fact they did so upon all their grand festivals, in order to entertain their guests with the best wine their cellar afforded.âBesides, we may here observe that the broaching all the vessels was not in compliance with custom, but that Chremes was forced into it by the importunities of Bacchis; neither does he mention it to Menedemus, but with an intent to let him see to what a monstrous expence he is going to expose himself: This mistake is of greater consequence than it may at first appear to be; for it is productive of many more, and led the AbbÃ© to place the scene of this comedy erroneously. The feast in question was that celebrated in the Autumn season, and was called Dionysia in agris, the Dionysia in the fields. Neither is the scene in Athens, as Mr. d'Aubignac supposed, but in a small village, where Chremes and Menedemus had each of them a house. The only difficulty remaining, is to account why Chremes says Dionysia hic sunt, the Dionysia are held here to-day. The reason is obvious. This feast continued for many days, but not in the same boroughs or villages at one and the same time; to-day it was here, to-morrow there, &amp;c. that they might assemble the more company together. Dacier. Menage observes that it is not clear on what authority Madam Dacier pronounces so absolutely, concerning the fluctuating manner of celebrating this feast, to-day here, to-morrow there, &amp;c. and though he differs with Hedelin about the place in which the scene lies, yet he defends the AbbÃ©'s opinion concerning the Pythoigia in opposition to Madam Dacier. Non nostrum est tantas componere lites. The Dionysia are held here to-day, If 'tis convenient, come, and feast with me. Mene. Impossible. Chremes. Why so?âNay, prithee now, Indulge yourself a while: your absent son, I'm sure, wou'd have it so. Mene. It is not meet, That I, who drove him forth to misery, Should fly it now myself. Chremes. You are resolv'd? Mene. Most constantly. Chremes. Farewel then! Mene. Fare you well! [Exit. SCENE II. CHREMES alone. He draws tears from me.âHow I pity him! âBut 'tis high time, as the day goes, to warn My neighbour Phania to come forth to supper. I'll go, and see if he's at home. [goes to Phania's door, and returns. There was, It seems, no need of warning: for, they tell me, He has been gone to my house some time since. I keep my guests in waiting; so I'll in. But my doors creak. [Clitipho appears. Who's this? I'll step aside. [retires. SCENE III. Enter CLITIPHO, speaking to Clinia within. As yet, my Clinia, you've no cause to fear: They are not long: and she, I'm confident, Will be here shortly with the messenger. Prithee, away then with these idle cares, Which thus torment you! Chremes, behind.] Whom does my son speak to? Clit. My father as I wish'd.âGood Sir, well met. Chremes. What now? Clit. D'ye know our neighbour Menedemus? Chremes. Ay, very well. Clit. D'ye know he has a son? Chremes. I've heard he is in Asia. Clit. No such thing: He's at our house, Sir. Chremes. How! Clit. But just arriv'd: Ev'n at his landing I fell in with him, And brought him here to supper: for, from boys, We have been friends and intimates. Chremes. Good news! Now do I wish the more, that Menedemus, Whom I invited, were my guest to-day, That I, and under my own roof, had been The first to have surpris'd him with this joy! And I may yet. [going. Clit. Take heed! it were not good. Chremes. How so? Clit. Because the youth is yet in doubt: Newly arriv'd; in fear of ev'ry thing; He dreads his father's anger, and suspects The disposition of his mistress tow'rds him; Her, whom he doats upon; on whose account, This diff'rence and departure came about. Chremes. I know it. Clit. He has just dispatch'd his boy Servolum ad eam in urbem misit. This plainly marks the scene to be in the country; though M. d'Aubignac treats this argument with ridicule. But it is in vain for him to assert that there is not one comedy of Plautus, or Terence, where one may not meet with this expression taken in his own sense of it. He will persuade none to think so, except those who have not read them. For my part I do not recollect one instance of it, and I will venture to say it is impossible to find one. Dacier. Into the city to her, and our Syrus I sent along with him. Chremes. What says the son? Clit. Says? that he's miserable. Chremes. Miserable! Who need be less so? for what earthly good Can man possess, which he may not enjoy? Parents, a prosp'rous country, friends, birth, riches. Yet these all take their value from the mind Of the possessor: He that knows their use, To him they're blessings; he that knows it not, To him misuse converts them into curses. Clit. Nay, but he ever was a cross old man: And now there's nothing that I dread so much, As lest he be transported in his rage To some gross outrages against his son. Chremes. He!âHe?âBut I'll contain myself. 'Tis good For Menedemus that his son shou'd fear. [aside. Clit. What say you, Sir, within yourself? [overhearing. Chremes. I say, Be't as it might, the son shou'd have remain'd. Grant that the father bore too strict a hand Upon his loose desires; he shou'd have born it. Whom would he bear withal, if not a parent? Was't fitting that the father shou'd conform To the son's humour, or the son to his? And for the rigour that he murmurs at, 'Tis nothing: The severities of fathers, Unless perchance a hard one here and there, Are much the same: they reprimand their sons For riotous excesses, wenching, drinking; And starve their pleasures by a scant allowance. Yet this all tends to good: But when the mind Is once enslav'd to vicious appetites, It needs must follow vicious measures too. Remember then this maxim, Clitipho, A wise one 'tis, to draw from others' faults A profitable lesson for yourself. Clit. I do believe it. Chremes. Well, I'll in, and see What is provided for our supper: You, As the day wears, see that you're not far hence. [Exit. SCENE IV. CLITIPHO alone. What partial judges of all sons are fathers! Who ask grey wisdom from our greener years, And think our minds shou'd bear no touch of youth; Governing by their passions, now kill'd in them, And not by those that formerly rebell'd. If ever I've a son, I promise him He shall find me an easy father; fit To know, and apt to pardon his offences: Not such as mine, who, speaking of another, Shews how he'd act in such a case himself: Yet when he takes a cup or two too much, Oh, what mad pranks he tells me of his own! But warns me now, âto draw from other's faults âA profitable lesson for myself.â Cunning old gentleman! he little knows, He pours his proverbs in a deaf man's ear. The words of Bacchis, Give me, Bring me, now Have greater weight with me: to whose commands, Alas! I've nothing to reply withall; Nor is there man more wretched than myself. For Clinia here, (though he, I must confess, Has cares enough) has got a mistress, modest, Well-bred, and stranger to all harlot arts: Mine is a self-will'd, wanton, haughty madam, Gay, and extravagant; and let her ask Whate'er she will, she must not be denied; Since poverty I durst not make my plea. This is a plague I have but newly found, Nor is my father yet appriz'd of it.</field>

This passage, as well as the circumstances of the next scene, are a further confirmation of the scene's lying in the country.

What eating, and what drinking will there be! How miserable our old gentleman! But here are those I wish'd to see! [seeing Clit. and Clin. Clin. Oh Jove! Where then are truth, and faith, and honour fled? While I a fugitive, for love of you, Quit my dear country, You, Antiphila, For sordid gain desert me in distress: You, for whose sake I courted infamy, And cast off my obedience to my father. He, I remember now with grief and shame, Oft warn'd me of these women's ways; oft tried In vain by sage advice to wean me from her. But now I bid farewell to her for ever; Though, when 'twere good and wholsome, I was froward. No wretch more curst than I! Syrus. He has misconstrued All our discourse, I find.âYou fancy, Clinia, Your mistress other than she is. Her life, As far as we from circumstance could learn, Her disposition tow'rd you, are the same. Clin. How! tell me all: for there is nought on earth I'd rather know than that my fears are false. Syrus. First then, that you may be appriz'd of all, Th'old woman, thought her mother, was not so: That beldam also is deceas'd; for this I overheard her, as we came along, Telling the other. Clit. Other! who? what other? Syrus. Let me but finish what I have begun, And I shall come to that. Clit. Dispatch then. Syrus. First, Having arriv'd, Dromo knocks at the door: Which an old woman had no sooner open'd, But in goes Dromo, and I after him. Th'old woman bolts the door, and spins again. And now, or never, Clinia, might be known, Coming thus unexpectedly upon her, Antiphila's employments in your absence: For such, as then we saw, we might presume Her daily practice, which of all things else, Betrays the mind and disposition most. Busily plying of the web we found her, Texentem telam studiose ipsam offendimus. This line of our author agrees almost literally with the following Greek one preserved by Le Clerc among the fragments of Menander. ?? ?????? ???????? ????????? ????. Decently clad in mourning,âI suppose, For the deceas'd old woman.âShe had on No gold, or trinkets, but was plain and neat, And drest like those who dress but for themselves. No female varnish to set off her beauty: Her hair dishevel'd, long, and flowing loose About her shoulders.âPeace! [to Clinia. Clin. Nay, prithee, Syrus, Do not transport me thus without a cause. Syrus. Th'old woman spun the woof; one servant-girl, A tatter'd dirty dowdy, weaving by her. PrÃ¦terea una ancillula erat: ea texebat unÃ , pannis obsita, neglecta, immunda illuvie. This passage is equally close to the sense of the following, taken from the same book. ???? ?????????? ?? ???, ???? ?????????? ??????? ??????????. Le Clerc took these Greek lines from Victorius; and Victorius copied them from a book of Politian, who had written them in the margin, not (as it should seem) of his own composition, but from a fragment, which he had somewhere met with, of Menander. Supposing the lines in question to be genuine, may we not fairly conclude that all this fine narration is a very close imitation of Menander, as well as that other beautiful one, which opens the first Act? Clit. Clinia, if this be true, as sure it is, Who is more fortunate than you? D'ye mark The ragged dirty girl that he describ'd? A sign the mistress leads a blameless life, When she maintains no flaunting go-between: For 'tis a rule with those gallants, who wish To win the mistress, first to bribe the maid. Clin. Go on, I beg you, Syrus; and take heed You fill me not with idle joy.âWhat said she When you nam'd Me? Syrus. As soon as we inform'd her You was return'd, and begg'd her to come to you, She left her work immediately, and burst Into a flood of tears, which one might see Were shed for love of you. Terence's Comedy of the Self-Tormentor is written as if he hoped to please none but such as had as good a taste as himself. I could not but reflect upon the natural description of the innocent young woman made by the servant to his master. When I came to the house, &amp;c.âHe must be a very good actor, and draw attention rather from his own character than the words of the author, that could gain it among us for this speech, though so full of nature and good sense. Steele's Spectator, No. 502. Clin. By all the Gods, I know not where I am for very joy. Oh, how I trembled! Clit. Without cause, I knew. Here we enter upon the other part of the fable, which the poet has most artfully complicated with the main subject, by making Syrus bring Clitipho's mistress along with Antiphila. This part of the story, we know, was not in Menander. But come; now, Syrus, tell us, who's that other? Syrus. Your mistress, Bacchis. Clit. How! what! Bacchis? Tell me, Where d'ye bring her, rogue? Syrus. Where do I bring her? To our house certainly. Clit. My father's? Syrus. Ay. Clit. Oh monstrous impudence! Syrus. Consider, Sir; More danger, the more honour. Clit. Look ye, sirrah, You mean to purchase praise at my expence, Where the least slip of yours would ruin me. What is't you drive at? Syrus. Butâ Clit. But what? Syrus. I'll tell you; Give me but leave! Clin. Permit him. Clit. Well, I do. Syrus. This businessânowâis just as ifâ[drawling. Clit. Confusion! What a long round-about beginning! Clin. True. To the point, Syrus! Syrus. I've no patience with you. You use me ill, Sir, and I can't endure it. Clin. Hear him: peace, Clitipho! [to Clitipho. Syrus. You'd be in love; Possess your mistress; and have wherewithal To make her presents: but to gain all this You'd risque no danger. By my troth, you're wise, If it be wise to wish for what can't be. Take good and bad together; both, or none; Chuse which you will; no mistress, or no danger. And yet the scheme I've laid is fair and safe; Your mistress may be with you at your father's Without detection; by the self-same means I shall procure the sum you've promis'd her, Which you have rung so often in my ears, You've almost deafen'd them.âWhat wou'd you more? Clit. If it may be soâ Syrus. If! the proof shall shew. Clit. Well, well then, what's this scheme? Syrus. We will pretend That Bacchis is his mistress. Clit. Mighty fine! What shall become then of his own? Shall she Pass for his too, because one's not enough To answer for? Syrus. No. She shall to your mother. Clit. How so? Syrus. 'Twere tedious, Clitipho, to tell: Let it suffice, I've reason for it. Clit. Nonsense! I see no ground to make me hazard this. Syrus. Well; if you dread this, I've another way, Which you shall both own has no danger in't. Clit. Ay, prithee, find that out. Syrus. With all my heart. I'll run and meet the women on the road, And order them to go strait home again. Clit. How! what! Syrus. I mean to ease you of your fear, That you may sleep in peace on either side. In AUREM utramvis, otiosÃ¨ ut dormias. Literally, on either EAR. A Latin proverb, used by Plautus as well as our author, and borrowed from the Greek. We have an instance of it among the fragments of the ???????, or Necklace, of Menander. The subject of that comedy, if we may judge from the small, though precious remains of it, was much the same as that of the George Dandin of Moliere, the marriage of a poor man to a rich heiress. An extract or two, may perhaps not be disagreeable to the reader, and serve to relieve the dryness of the controversial notes to this comedy. The very first line contains the proverb. ??? ???????? ?? ?? ? ????????? ????? ?????? ???????????, ??????????? ???? ??? ?????????? ?????Â· ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ??? ???????? ?? ????????, ??? ?????????? ?????? ??? ?? ????????? ????????, ? ?? ????????? ? ?? ??? ????, ???????? ??? ??? ????, ?? ????????. ???? ?? ???????? ???? ?? ?? ?????????. ????? ?? ?????? ???? ???, ?? ??? ????????. ??????????? ??? ????? ?????? ??? ????? ???????Â· ?????, ????????? ?????? ???, ??? ??????? ????, ??????? ????? ??????. ???? ???? ?? ??????? ??? ?? ?????????? ?? ????????????? ??? ??????, ???????. ???????????? ????????????, ??? ????? ??????, ???????, ??? ????? ??????????. Now may our Heiress sleep on either ear, Having perform'd a great and mighty feat, And satisfied the longings of her soul. Her, whom she hated most, she has cast forth, That all the world may henceforth look upon The visage of Creobyla, and thence May know my wife for mistress, by the print Of stern authority upon her brow. She is indeed, as the old saying goes, A proverb to signify those, who are proud among those, who laugh at them. An Ass among the Apes.âThis can't be kept In silence, even tho' I wish'd it so. Curse on the night, the source of all my ills! Ah me, that I shou'd wed Creobyla! âTen Talents, and a wife of half-a-yard! And then who is there can endure her pride? By Jove, by Pallas, 'tis intolerable. A maid most diligent, and quick as thought, She has cast forth, to introduce another. There is another passage extant, containing part of a dialogue between the husband and an old neighbour, on the same subject; but, for the sake of variety, I shall subjoin an extract from the same comedy of a different colour. ? ???? ??????????, ????? ?? ????? ?????, ??? ?????????????Â· ?? ???????? ???? ????, ?? ???? ??????? ??? ????????? ????, ???? ?? ???????? ??? ?? ????? ??? ????, ??????????? ????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?? ????????, ??? ????????? ??? ???????????? ??, ??? ??? ??????? ???? ?????? ????? ??, ??? ?? ?????? ?? ?????????. Thrice wretched he, that's poor and takes a wife, And doth engender children!âOh fool, fool! Who undefended, bare of necessaries, Soon as ill fortune comes, that comes to all, Can't wrap his miseries in affluence; But in a naked, wretched, poverty Freezes, like winter; misery his portion Too amply dealt, and every good denied. What Menander has in the above passage considered metaphorically, our own Shakespeare has very finely realized: Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm! How shall your houseless heads, and unfed sides, Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you From seasons such as these? King Lear. [going. Clit. What shall I do? Clin. E'en profit of his scheme. Clit. But, Syrus, tell me thenâ Syrus. Away, away! This day, too late, you'll wish for her in vain. [going. Clin. This is your time: enjoy it, while you may: Who knows, if you may have the like again? Clit. Syrus, I say. Syrus. Call as you please, I'll on. Clit. Clinia, you're right.âHo, Syrus! Syrus, ho! Syrus, I say. Syrus. So, he grows hot at last. [to himself. What would you, Sir? [turning about. Clit. Come back, come back! Syrus. I'm here. [returns. Your pleasure, Sir!âWhat, will not this content you? Clit. Yes, Syrus; me, my passion, and my fame I render up to you: dispose of all; But see you're not to blame. Syrus. Ridiculous! Spare your advice, good Clitipho! you know Success is my concern still more than your's: For if perchance we fail in our attempt, You shall have words; but I, alas, dry blows. Be sure then of my diligence; and beg Your friend to join, and countenance our scheme. Clin. Depend on me: I see it must be so. Clit. Thanks, my best Clinia! Clin. But take heed she trip not. Syrus. Oh, she is well instructed. Clit. Still I wonder How you prevail'd so easily upon her; Her, who's so scornfull. Syrus. I came just in time, Time, that in most affairs is all in all: For there I found a certain wretched captain, Begging her favours. HÃ¦c arte tractabat virum, ut illius animum cupidum inopiÃ¢ accenderet. There is the same sentiment, and much of the same turn of expression in Shakespeare's All's Well that Ends Well. She knew her distance, and did angle for me, Madding my eagerness with her restraint, As all impediments in fancy's course Are motives of more fancy. This sentiment is also finely touched upon by Ben Jonson in his Every Man in his Humour. The occasion on which it is employed by Shakespeare, is almost parallel to that in Terence, but in Ben Jonson's play it is applied to the education of youth. I am resolv'd I will not stop his journey, Nor practice any violent means to stay Th'unbridled course of youth in him; for that Restrain'd, grows more impatient; and in kind Like to the eager, but the generous grey-hound, Who ne'er so little from his game with-held, Turns head, and leaps up at his holder's throat. Every Man in his Humour, Act. I. I do not say that the above fine lines were struck out from this passage in Terence; but it is plain that the remainder of Knowell's speech, as the late ingenious editor of Jonson has justly observed, was borrowed from another part of our author's works, which shall be pointed out in the notes on the next comedy.She, an artful baggage, Denied him, to enflame his mind the more, And make her court to you.âBut hark ye, Sir, Be cautious of your conduct! no imprudence! You know how shrewd and keen your father is; And I know your intemperance too well. No double-meanings, glances, leers, sighs, hems, Coughing, or titt'ring, I beseech you, Sir! Clit. I'll play my partâ Syrus. Look to't! Clit. To your content. Syrus. But see, the women! they're soon after us. [looking out. Clit. Where are they?â[Syrus stops him.] Why d'ye hold me? Syrus. She is not Your mistress now. Clit. True: not before my father. But now, mean whileâ Syrus. Nor now, mean while. Clit. Allow me! Syrus. No. Clit. But a moment! Syrus. No. Clit. A single kiss! Syrus. Away, if you are wise! Clit. Well, well, I'm gone. âWhat's He to do? Syrus. Stay here. Clit. O happyâ Syrus. March! [pushes off Clitipho. SCENE III. Enter BACCHIS, and ANTIPHILA at a distance. Bacch. Well, I commend you, my Antiphila: Happy, that you have made it still your care, That virtue should seem fair as beauty in you! Nor, gracious Heav'n so help me, do I wonder If ev'ry man should wish you for his own; For your discourse bespeaks a worthy mind. And when I ponder with myself, and weigh Your course of life, and all the rest of those Who live not on the common, 'tis not strange, Your morals should be different from our's. Virtue's your int'rest; those, with whom we deal, Forbid it to be our's: For our gallants, Charm'd by our beauty, court us but for That; Which fading, they transfer their love to others. If then meanwhile we look not to ourselves, We live forlorn, deserted, and distrest. You, when you've once agreed to pass your life Bound to one man, whose temper suits with your's, He too attaches his whole heart to you: Thus mutual friendship draws you each to each; Nothing can part you, nothing shake your love. Anti. The character of Antiphila is here finely drawn, and represents innocence in perfection. There is nothing of constraint or emulation in her virtue, nor is she influenced by any consideration of the miseries likely to attend looseness or debauchery, but purely by a natural biass to virtue. Dacier.I know not others; for myself I know, From his content I ever drew my own. Clin. (apart.) overhearing.] Excellent maid! my best Antiphila! Thou too, thy love alone is now the cause That brings me to my native land again. For when away, all evils else were light Compar'd to wanting thee. Syrus. (apart.) I do believe it. Clin. (apart.) Madam Dacier, contrary to the authority of all editions and MSS. adopts a conceit of her father's in this place, and places this speech to Clitipho, whom she supposes to have retired to a hiding-place, where he might over-hear the conversation, and from whence he peeps out to make this speech to Syrus. This she calls an agreeable jeu de theatre, and doubts not but all lovers of Terence will be obliged to her father for so ingenious a remark: but it is to be feared that critical sagacity will not be so lavish of acknowledgements as filial piety. There does not appear the least foundation for this remark in the scene, nor has the Poet given us the least room to doubt of Clitipho's being actually departed. To me, instead of an agreeable jeu de theatre, it appears a most absurd and ridiculous device; particularly vicious in this place, as it most injudiciously tends to interrupt the course of Clinia's more interesting passion, so admirably delineated in this little scene.O Syrus, 'tis too much: I cannot bear it. Wretch that I am!âand must I be debarr'd To give a loose to love, a love like this? Syrus. (apart.) And yet if I may judge your father's mind, He has more troubles yet in store for you. Bacch. Who is that youth that eyes us? [seeing Clinia. Anti. Ha! [seeing him.]âSupport me! Bacch. Bless me, what now? Anti. I faint. Bacch. Alas, poor soul! What is't surprizes you, Antiphila? Anti. Is't Clinia that I see, or no? Bacch. Whom do you see? Clin. Welcome my soul! [running up to her. Anti. My wish'd-for Clinia, welcome! Clin. How fares my love? Anti. O'erjoy'd at your return. Clin. And do I hold thee, my Antiphila, Thou only wish, and comfort of my soul? Syrus. In, in, for you have made our good man wait. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. CHREMES. 'Tis now just day-break. Lucescit hoc jam. This is spoken with the eyes lifted up towards heaven; hoc has reference to cÅlum, which is understood. Thus Plautus in his Curculio. Nam hoc quidem edepol haud multÃ² post luce lucebit. It is beyond all doubt that this play was acted at two different and distinct times; the two first acts at night, after sun-set; and the three remaining acts the next morning, at break of day: the time between the second and third act was taken up with the carousal and supper given by Chremes. Menander, upon account of the feasts then celebrating, had a right to divide his comedy in this manner: Terence took the same liberty, and with the same justice, since his plays were represented at Rome upon the like solemn occasions. Eugraphius, who wrote notes upon this comedy, was of opinion that this method was without precedent; but he is mistaken. Aristophanes did the very same thing; the two first acts of his Plutus were performed in the evening, the three last early the next morning, and the time between the second and third act is employed by Plutus in paying a visit to the temple of Ãsculapius, where he passes the whole night. If we could precisely tell the hour, at which Aristophanes opens his play, we should undoubtedly find he had not transgressed the unity of time (twelve hours) which is requisite to dramatick pieces. It is at least certain that Terence has not exceeded it here, and that he is as exact in this particular as in every other. The play begins a little after eight at night. The two first acts do not last above two hours; they then go to supper; this makes an interval of six or seven hours. The third act begins at the break of day, as Terence has taken care to point out, lucescit hoc jam;â'tis now just day-break.âSo that the three acts, which could not last three hours, must have ended about seven in the morning. But what is chiefly remarkable is, that this third interval is interwoven with the subject matter of the play, as well as it is in Aristophanes. Chremes, during that time, observes the freedoms which pass between Clitipho and Bacchis; and this creates great part of the business of the third act. The critics were little attentive to this, when they cry out,âVasta &amp; hians &amp; inanis comÅdia est;âthere is a void, a gap, an emptiness in this comedy.âWhich is far, very far from being true; for what they call so, has a very material connection with the play, and may be said to be almost the very ground-work of it. Had Terence divided it so, that this interval had not entered into the subject, it would indeed have been ridiculous and insupportable. Were we to act one of Moliere's plays thus by piece-meal, the beginning to-night, and the end to-morrow morning, every body would laugh at the partition; but Terence and Menander, who were perfect masters of the drama, attempted it with success. And indeed it might even now a-days be done with propriety, nay would become necessary, provided it could be executed with equal judgment and address. Dacier. The idea of the above note, as well as of several others of Madam Dacier, was first suggested by Scaliger, who, in the sixth book of his Poeticks, first broached the notion of this division of the comedy in the representation, in order to vindicate our author from the imputation of having left an unwarrantable chasm between the second and third acts. And it is something whimsical, that this great critick, after having depreciated our author's merit in the gross, more than any of his predecessors, should take it into his head to justify him against every objection that had been made to any particular passage in his works. But though Scaliger was ever dogmatical and positive in his opinion, yet that opinion was not always uncontrovertible: In the present instance I am so far from assenting with Madam Dacier that the fact is beyond all doubt, that I will venture to say there is not the least ground for such an assertion. Donatus, who mentions this play in his preface to the Phormio, does not afford the least colour to such an argument; nor do I believe there is any more countenance given to it by the scholiasts on Aristophanes: whose comedies it would be an extremely difficult task to reconcile to an agreement with the Unities. One of the chief points in dispute between Hedelin and Menage, about this comedy, relates to this interval; and great part of the controversy turns upon a very obscure and uncertain part of literature, viz. whether the Athenian month Anthesterion be agreeable to our April or January. Both agree that a night elapses between the second and third act; but Hedelin, who is followed by Madam Dacier in the above note, contends that according to the time of year, and circumstances of the piece, it is an interval of six or seven hours, which Menage extends to thirteen or fourteen. Each of them lays out a deal of learning on this question, but in my mind to very little purpose. It is agreed on all hands, that a whole night certainly passes, and the spectator has not time to enter into a minute disquisition, whether 'tis in June or December: nor indeed could any thing tend to make the observation of the Unities appear ridiculous, so much as such a trifling consideration.âAs to what Madam Dacier says of this interval's being interwoven with the subject; and of the supposed employments of the characters, in their absence from the stage, being made conducive to the fable; it is perfectly just, and every skilfull playwright should contrive his intervals with the like art. But to fill up those chasms by occupying the audience also in the same manner, is, I think, a more curious device than any in the Rehearsal. Madam Dacier herself could not be insensible of the difficulty, and confesses that a play of Moliere's, so divided in the representation, would appear very ridiculous; yet is willing to imagine that even a modern drama might be thus exhibited with propriety. Let us suppose therefore that, at the first opening of the theatre in the Haymarket, Sir John Vanburgh had written a comedy, in which he had introduced a masquerade at the end of the second act. The spectators assemble: two acts are played: then comes the masquerade; and the spectators, in order to fill up the interval, slip on their dominos, game, drink, dance, and intrigue 'till day-light. With what appetite would they return to the representation of the three last acts? However such a partition might be received at Rome or Athens, I think it would never go down at Paris or London: and, were it not for the example of Madam Dacier, I should imagine that even the most rigid French critick would think it more reasonable to be wafted from shore to shore by Shakespeare's chorus, than to adopt this extraordinary method of preserving the Unities.âWhy delay I then To call my neighbour forth, and be the first To tell him of his son's return?âThe youth, I understand, would fain not have it so. But shall I, when I see this poor old man Afflict himself so grievously, by silence Rob him of such an unexpected joy, When the discov'ry cannot hurt the son? No, I'll not do't; but far as in my pow'r Assist the father. As my son, I see, Ministers to th'occasions of his friend, Associated in counsels, rank, and age, So we old men should serve each other too. SCENE II. Enter MENEDEMUS. Menedemus comes out of his house at day-break to return to his work; for he has already declared that he will allow himself no respite. This is well conducted. Dacier. Mene. to himself.] Sure I'm by nature form'd for misery Beyond the rest of humankind, or else 'Tis a false saying, though a common one, âThat time assuages grief.â For ev'ry day My sorrow for the absence of my son Grows on my mind: the longer he's away, The more impatiently I wish to see him, The more pine after him. Chremes. But he's come forth. [seeing Menedemus. Yonder he stands. I'll go and speak with him. Good morrow, neighbour! I have news for you; Such news, as you'll be overjoy'd to hear. Mene. Of my son, Chremes? Terence discovers uncommon judgment in preserving his characters. Menedemus, when he hears of good news, immediately enquires, if they relate to his son, thinking nothing else worthy his notice. Patrick. Chremes. He's alive and well. Mene. Where? Chremes. At my house. Mene. My son? Chremes. Your son. Mene. Come home? Chremes. Come home. Mene. My dear boy come? my Clinia? These repetitions are very natural. There is a passage very like this in the fourth act of the Captivi of Plautus. Chremes. He. Mene. Away then! prithee, bring me to him. Chremes. Hold! He cares not you should know of his return, And dreads your sight because of his late trespass. He fears, besides, your old severity Is now augmented. Mene. Did not you inform him The bent of my affections? Chremes. Not I. Mene. Wherefore, Chremes? Chremes. Because 'twould injure both yourself and him To seem of such a poor and broken spirit. Mene. I cannot help it. Too long, much too long, I've been a cruel father. Chremes. Ah, my friend, You run into extremes; too niggardly, Or, too profuse; imprudent either way. First, rather than permit him entertain A mistress, who was then content with little, And glad of any thing, you drove him hence: Wereon the girl was forc'd, against her will, To grow a common gamester for her bread: And now she can't be kept without much cost, You'd squander thousands. For to let you know How admirably Madam's train'd to mischief, How finely form'd to ruin her admirers, Chremes takes Bacchis for Clinia's mistress, and his own son is her real gallant. This jeu de theatre is admirable. Dacier. She came to my house yester-night with more Than half a score of women at her tail, Laden with cloaths and jewels.âIf she had Satrapes si siet amator. Satrapes is originally a Hebrew word, but in use too among the Persians, who gave this title to the governours of their provinces; who were generally very rich, and so many petty kings in the eastern nations. Patrick. A Prince to her gallant, he could not bear Such wild extravagance: much less can You. Mene. Is She within too? Chremes. She within? Ay, truly. I've found it to my cost: for I have given To her and her companions but one supper; And to give such another would undo me. For, not to dwell on other circumstances, Merely to taste, and smack, and spirt about, Pytissando. Pytissare is a word originally Greek, and is, what we call, a verb of imitation, for its sound very much resembles the noise made by the action of spirting wine out of the mouth. Patrick. What quantities of wine has she consum'd! This is too rough, she cries; some softer, pray! I have pierc'd every vessel, ev'ry cask; Kept ev'ry servant running to and fro: All this ado, and all in one short night! What, Menedemus, must become of you, Whom they will prey upon continually? Now, afore heaven, thinking upon this, I pitied you. Mene. Why, let him have his will; Here we have, drawn in lively colours, the picture of a man hasty in running from one extreme to another. This gives occasion to the expedient offered by Chremes, which comes in very naturally, and insensibly leads to the remaining part of the plot. Patrick. Waste, consume, squander; I'll endure it all, So I but have him with me. Chremes. If resolv'd To take that course, I hold it of great moment That he perceive not you allow of this. Mene. What shall I do then? Chremes. Any thing, much rather Than what you mean to do: at second hand Supply him; or permit his slave to trick you; Though I perceive they're on that scent already, And privately contriving how to do't. There's Syrus, and that little slave of your's In an eternal whisper: the young men Consulting too together: and it were Better to lose a Talent by these means, Than on your plan a Mina: for at present Money is not the question, but the means To gratify the youth the safest way. For if he once perceives your turn of mind, And that you'd rather hazard life, and wealth, Than part from him; ah, Menedemus, what A window to debauchery you'll open! Nay, life itself will grow a burthen to you; For too much liberty corrupts us all. Whatever comes into his head, he'll have; Nor think, if his demand be right or wrong. You, on your part, to see your wealth and son Both wreck'd, will not be able to endure. You'll not comply with his demands; whereon He falls to his old fence immediately, And knowing where your weak part lies, will threaten To leave you instantly. Mene. 'Tis very like. Chremes. Now on my life I have not clos'd my eyes, Hedelin obstinately contends from this passage, that neither Chremes, nor any of his family went to bed the whole night; the contrary of which is evident, as Menage observes, from the two next scenes. For why should Syrus take notice of his being up so early, if he had known that he had never retired to rest? or would Chremes have reproached Clitipho for his behaviour the night before, had the feast never been interrupted? Eugraphius's interpretation of these words is natural and obvious; who explains them to signify that the anxiety of Chremes to restore Clinia to Menedemus broke his rest. Nor had a single wink of sleep this night, For thinking how I might restore your son. Mene. Give me your hand: and let me beg you, Chremes, Continue to assist me! Chremes. Willingly. Mene. D'ye know, what I would have you do at present? Chremes. What? Mene. Since you have found out they meditate Some practice on me, prithee, urge them on To execute it quickly: for I long To grant his wishes, long to see him strait. Chremes. Let me alone. I must lay hold of Syrus, And give him some encouragement.âBut see! Some one, I know not who, comes forth: In, in, Chremes seizes this as a very plausible and necessary pretence to engage Menedemus to return home, and not to his labour in the field, as he had at first intended. Dacier. Lest they perceive that we consult together! I have a little business too in hand. Simus and Crito, our two neighbours here, Have a dispute about their boundaries; This circumstance is a further confirmation that the scene lies in the country. And they've referr'd it to my arbitration. I'll go and tell them, 'tis not in my power To wait on them, as I propos'd, to-day. I will be with you presently. Mene. Pray do. [Exit Chremes. Gods! that the nature of mankind is such, To see, and judge of the affairs of others, Much better than their own! These reflections have double force, when thrown out to the audience, who are conscious how applicable they are to Chremes as well as Menedemus. Is't therefore so, Because that, in our own concerns, we feel Too much the influence of joy or sorrow? How much more wisely does my neighbour here Consult for me, than I do for myself! Chremes returning.] I've disengag'd myself, that I might be At leisure to attend on your affairs. [Exit Menedemus. SCENE III. Enter SYRUS at another part of the Stage. Syrus to himself.] This way, or that way, or some way or other! For money must be had, and th'old man trick'd. Chremes overhearing.] Was I deceiv'd, in thinking they were at it? That slave of Clinia's, it should seem, is dull, And so our Syrus has the part assign'd him. Syrus. Who's there? [seeing Chremes.] Undone, if he has overheard me. [aside. Chremes. Syrus! Syrus. Sir! Chremes. What now? Syrus. Nothing.âBut I wonder To see you up so early in the morning, Who drank so freely yesterday. Chremes. Not much. Syrus. Not much? You have, Sir, as the proverb goes, The old age of an eagle. Most probably a proverb, signifying a vigorous and lusty old age, like that of the eagle; who, as naturalists say, never dies of old age, and preserves its life by perpetual drinking. Dacier. Patrick. Chremes. Ah! Syrus. A pleasant, Good sort of girl, this wench of Clinia's. Chremes. Ay, so she seems. Syrus. And handsome. Chremes. Well enough. Syrus. Ita non ut olim, &amp;c. This is certainly the true meaning of the sentence. Syrus artfully flatters the vanity of Chremes; old men are generally apt to think every thing they have seen or heard in former times, far surpasses the productions of the present. Dacier. Not like the maids of old, but passable, As girls go now: nor am I much amaz'd That Clinia doats upon her. But he has, Alas, poor lad! a miserable, close, Dry, covetous, curmudgeon to his father: Our neighbour here; d'ye know him?âYet, as if He did not roll in riches, his poor son Was forc'd to run away for very want. D'ye know this story? Chremes. Do I know it? Ay. A scoundrel! should be horse-whipt. Syrus. Who? Chremes. That slave Of Clinia'sâ Syrus. Troth, I trembled for you, Syrus! [aside. Chremes. Who suffer'd this. Syrus. Why what should he have done? Chremes. What?âhave devis'd expedients, contriv'd schemes, To raise the cash for the young gentleman To make his mistress presents; and have done A kindness to the old hunks against his will. Syrus. You jest. Chremes. Not I: it was his duty, Syrus. Syrus. How's this? why prithee then, d'ye praise those slaves, Who trick their masters? Chremes. Yes, upon occasion. Syrus. Mighty fine, truly! Chremes. Why, it oft prevents A great deal of uneasiness: for instance, This Clinia, Menedemus' only son, Would never have elop'd. Syrus. I cannot tell, Whether he says all this in jest or earnest; But it gives fresh encouragement to Me. [aside. Chremes. And now what is't the blockhead waits for, Syrus? Is't, till his master runs away again, When he perceives himself no longer able To bear with the expences of his mistress? Has he no plot upon th'old gentleman? Syrus. He's a poor creature. Chremes. But it is your part, For Clinia's sake, to lend a helping hand. Syrus. Why that indeed I easily can do, If you command me; for I know which way. Chremes. I take you at your word. Syrus. I'll make it good. Chremes. Do so. Syrus. But hark ye, Sir! remember this, If ever it hereafter comes to pass, âAs who can answer for th'affairs of men? That your own sonâ Chremes. I hope 'twill never be. Syrus. I hope so too; nor do I mention this, From any knowledge or suspicion of him: But that in caseâhis time of life, you know; And should there be occasion, trust me, Chremes, But I could handle you most handsomely. Chremes. Well, well, we'll think of it, when that time comes. Now to your present task! [Exit Chremes. SCENE IV. SYRUS alone. I never heard My master argue more commodiously; Nor ever had a mind to mischief, when It might be done with more impunity. But who's this coming from our house? SCENE V. Enter CLITIPHO, and CHREMES following. Chremes. How now? What manners are these, Clitipho? Does this Become you? Clit. What's the matter? Chremes. Did not I This very instant see you put your hand Into yon wench's bosom? Syrus. So! all's over: I am undone. [aside. Clit. Me, Sir? Chremes. These very eyes Beheld you: don't deny it.â'Tis base in you, To be so flippant with your hands. For what Affront's more gross, than to receive a friend Under your roof, and tamper with his mistress? And last night in your cups too how indecent, And rudely you behav'd! Syrus. 'Tis very true. Chremes. So very troublesome, so help me heav'n, I fear'd the consequence. I know the ways Of lovers: they oft take offence at things, You dream not of. Clit. But my companion, Sir, Is confident I would not wrong him. Chremes. Granted. Yet you should cease to hang for ever on them. Withdraw, and leave them sometimes to themselves. Love has a thousand sallies; you restrain them. I can conjecture from myself. There's none, How near soever, Clitipho, to whom I dare lay open all my weaknesses. With one my pride forbids it, with another The very action shames me: and believe me, It is the same with Him; and 'tis our place To mark on what occasions to indulge him. Syrus. What says He now? [aside. Clit. Confusion! Syrus. Clitipho, These are the very precepts that I gave you: And how discreet and temperate you've been! Clit. Prithee, peace! Syrus. Ay, I warrant you. Chremes. Oh, Syrus, I'm quite asham'd of him. Syrus. I do not doubt it. Nor without reason; for it troubles Me. Clit. Still, rascal? Syrus. Nay, I do but speak the truth. Clit. May I not then go near them? Chremes. Prithee, then, Is there one way alone of going near them? Syrus. Confusion! he'll betray himself, before I get the money. [aside.]âChremes, will you once Hear a fool's counsel? Chremes. What do you advise? Syrus. Order your son about his business. Clit. Whither? Syrus. Whither? where'er you please. Give place to Them. Go, take a walk. Clit. Walk! where? Syrus. A pretty question! This, that, or any way. Chremes. He says right. Go! Clit. Now, plague upon you, Syrus! [going. Syrus to Clit. going.] Henceforth, learn To keep those hands of yours at rest. [Exit. Clit.] SCENE VI. D'ye mind? What think you, Chremes, will become of him, Unless you do your utmost to preserve, Correct and counsel him? Chremes. I'll take due care. Syrus. But now's your time, Sir, to look after him. Chremes. It shall be done. Syrus. It must be, if you're wise: For ev'ry day he minds me less and less. Chremes. But, Syrus, say, what progress have you made In that affair I just now mention'd to you? Have you struck out a scheme, that pleases you? Or are you still to seek? Syrus. The plot, you mean, On Menedemus. I've just hit on one. Chremes. Good fellow! prithee now, what is't? Syrus. I'll tell you. But as one thing brings in anotherâ Chremes, Well? Syrus. This Bacchis is a sad jade. Chremes. So it seems. Syrus. Ay, Sir, if you knew all! nay, even now She's hatching mischief.âDwelling hereabouts, There was of late an old Corinthian woman, To whom this Bacchis lent a thousand pieces. Chremes. What then? Syrus. The woman's dead; and left behind A daughter, very young, whom she bequeath'd, By way of pledge, to Bacchis for the money. Chremes. I understand. Syrus. This girl came here with Bacchis, And now is with your wife. Antiphila is shortly to be acknowledged as the daughter of Chremes. She is not therefore in company with the other women at the feast, who were no other than courtezans, but with the wife of Chremes, and consequently free from reproach or scandal. Dacier. Chremes. What then? Syrus. She begs Of Clinia to advance the cash; for which She'll give the girl as an equivalent. She wants the thousand pieces. Chremes. Does she so? Syrus. No doubt on't. Chremes. So I thought.âAnd what do you Intend to do? Syrus. Who? I, Sir? I'll away To Menedemus presently; and tell him This maiden is a rich and noble captive, Stolen from Caria; and to ransom her Will greatly profit him. Chremes. 'Twill never do. Syrus. How so? Chremes. I answer now for Menedemus. I will not purchase her. What say you now? Syrus. Give a more favourable answer! Chremes. No, There's no occasion. Chremes is not allowed here to explain himself, being prevented by the coming of his wife; nor have any of the commentators given themselves the trouble to do it for him. What seems most probable to me is this. He finds that Bacchis makes a demand of ten minÃ¦, and offers Antiphila as a pledge for it; a bargain by which he was sure to lose nothing, and wherein Bacchis could not deceive him, the girl being already in his possession. It is therefore likely that he intended to advance the money on those conditions himself. Dacier. The above conjecture of Madam Dacier would be a very ingenious way of accounting for a man's conduct in these circumstances in real life; but in a play where the source of every action is industriously laid open by the poet, had this been the intention of Chremes, I should think it would have been exprest, and the motive, that influenced him to it, also assigned. The following note on this scene gives a much better account of this conference between Chremes and Syrus, and shews of how much use it is in the ensuing part of the fable. âSyrus pretends to have concerted this plot against Menedemus, in order to trick him out of some money to be given to Clinia's supposed mistress. Chremes, however, does not approve of this: yet it serves to carry on the plot; for when Antiphila proves afterwards to be the daughter of Chremes, he necessarily becomes the debtor of Bacchis, and is obliged to lay down the sum for which he imagines his daughter was pledged.â Eugraphius. Syrus. No occasion? Chremes. No. Syrus. I cannot comprehend you. Chremes. I'll explain. âBut hold! what now? whence comes it, that our door Opens so hastily? SCENE VII. Enter at a distance SOSTRATA with a Ring, and the Nurse. Sostra. Or I'm deceiv'd, Or this is certainly the very ring; The ring, with which my daughter was expos'd. Chremes to Syrus behind.] What can those words mean, Syrus? Sostra. Tell me, Nurse! Does it appear to you to be the same? Nurse. Ay, marry: and the very moment that You shew'd it me, I said it was the same. Sostra. But have you thoroughly examin'd, Nurse? Nurse. Ay, thoroughly. Sostra. In then, and let me know If she has yet done bathing; and meanwhile I'll wait my husband here. [Exit Nurse. Syrus. She wants you, Sir! enquire, What she would have. She's grave, I know not why. 'Tis not for nothing; and I fear the cause. Chremes. The cause? pshaw! nothing. She'll take mighty pains To be deliver'd of some mighty trifle. Sostra. seeing them.] Oh husband! Chremes. Oh Wife! Sostra. I was looking for you. Chremes. Your pleasure? Sostra. First, I must intreat you then, Believe, I would not dare do any thing Against your order. Chremes. What! must I believe A thing past all belief?âI do believe it. Syrus. This exculpation bodes some fault, I'm sure. [aside. Sostra. Do you remember, I was pregnant once, When you assur'd me with much earnestness, That if I were deliver'd of a girl, You would not have the child brought up? Chremes. I know What you have done. You have brought up the child. Syrus. Madam, if so, my master gains a loss. Si sic factum est, domina, ergo herus DAMNO AUCTUS est. The most indifferent parts of an author commonly give the most trouble. The sense of the original being somewhat dark, and the best construction not very elegant, several attempts have been made to amend and alter the text. In this, as in most other cases, I believe the common reading to be the right; and that it contains nothing more than a conceit from the slave, founded on the words damno auctus, which I have endeavoured to render in the manner of the original, gains a loss. Some think by his master is meant Clitipho, others Chremes. Eugraphius explains the words to signify that Clitipho will be a loser by a new-found sister, who will be co-heiress; and others will have them to imply the loss to be sustained by Chremes in paying Antiphila's portion. Sostra. No, I have not: but there was at that time An old Corinthian woman dwelling here, To whom I gave the child to be expos'd. Chremes. O Jupiter! Was ever such a fool! Sostra. Ah, what have I committed? Chremes. What committed? Sostra. If I've offended, Chremes, 'tis a crime Of ignorance, and nothing of my purpose. Chremes. Own it, or not, I know it well enough, That ignorantly, and imprudently, You do and say all things: how many faults In this one action are you guilty of? For first, had you complied with my commands, The girl had been dispatch'd; One cannot avoid being seized with a kind of horror, to think that, in a country so polite as Greece, men should be so barbarous, as to murder their own children without remorse, when they imagined it to be for the interest of their family. Philosophy had long before this demonstrated the horror, not only of these murders, but even of exposing children. But philosophy is always weak and unavailing, when opposed to customs authorized by long usage. Patrick. and not her death. Pretended, and hopes given of her life. But that I do not dwell upon: You'll cry, âPity,âa mother's fondness.âI allow it. But then how rarely you provided for her! What could you mean? consider!âfor 'tis plain, You have betray'd your child to that old beldam, Either for prostitution, or for sale. So she but liv'd, it was enough, you thought: No matter how, or what vile life she led. âWhat can one do, or how proceed, with those, Who know of neither reason, right, nor justice? Better or worse, for or against, they see Nothing but what they list. Sostra. My dearest Chremes, I own I have offended: I'm convinc'd. But since you're more experienc'd than myself, I pray you be the more indulgent too, And let my weakness shelter in your justice. Chremes. Well, well, I pardon you: but, Sostrata, Forgiving you thus easily, I do But teach you to offend again. But come, Say, wherefore you begun this? Sostra. As we women Are generally weak and superstitious, When first to this Corinthian old woman I gave the little infant, from my finger I drew a ring, and charg'd her to expose That with my daughter: that if chance she died, The ancients imagined they were guilty of a most heinous crime, if they suffered their children to die, without having possessed some part of their fortune: the women therefore, who are generally superstitious, when they exposed their children, put some jewel or other trinket among their cloaths, by this means thinking to discharge their claim of inheritance, and to clear their own conscience. Dacier. She might have part of our possessions with her. Chremes. The meaning of this passage is this. Chremes tells his wife, that by having given this ring, she had done two good acts instead of one; she had cleared her conscience, and preserved her child; for had there been no ring or other token among the infant's things, the finder would scarce have been at the trouble of taking care of her, but might have left her to perish, never suspecting she would ever be enquired after, or themselves liberally rewarded for their pains of preserving her. Dacier. 'Twas right: you thus preserv'd yourself and her. Sostra. This is that ring. Chremes. Where had it you? Sostra. The girl That Bacchis brought with herâ Syrus. Ha! [aside. Chremes. What says she? Sostra. Desir'd I'd keep it while she went to bathe. Hedelin is grossly mistaken in saying that Antiphila bathed during the fourth act. It is so far from true, that, in the beginning of this scene, Sostrata sends the nurse to see if Antiphila was not already come out of the bath. Dacier. I took no notice on't at first; but I No sooner look'd on't, than I knew't again, And strait ran out to you. Chremes. And what d'ye think, Or know concerning her? Sostra. I cannot tell, Till you enquire of herself, and find, If possible, from whence she had the ring. Syrus. Undone! I see more hope than I desire. Syrus is alarmed, fearing that, by the discovery of Antiphila, their plot on Menedemus would be baffled, and their imposition on Chremes detected. Eugraphius. She's our's, if this be so. [aside. Chremes. Is she alive To whom you gave the child? Sostra. I do not know. Chremes. What did she tell you formerly? Sostra. That she Had done what I commanded her. Chremes. Her name; That we may make enquiry. Sostra. Philtere. Syrus. The very same! she's found, and I am lost. [aside. Chremes. In with me, Sostrata! Sostra. Beyond my hopes. How much I fear'd you should continue still So rigidly inclin'd, as formerly, When you refus'd to educate her, Chremes! Chremes. Men cannot always be, as they desire, This he says by way of palliating the cruelty of his former orders to put the child to death. Dacier. But must be govern'd by their fortunes still. The times are alter'd with me, and I wish To have a daughter now; then, nothing less. Here ends the act, and, by the discovery of Antiphila, to all appearance, the main story of the piece. The following observation on the great art of our poet, in continuing it through two acts more, is extremely just and ingenious. âWhat would become of the piece which Terence has called the Self-Tormentor, if the poet, by an extraordinary effort of genius, had not contrived to take up the story of Clinia anew, and to weave it in with the intrigue of Clitipho?â Diderot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. SYRUS alone. My mind misgives me, my defeat is nigh. Madam Dacier, and most of the later criticks who have implicitly followed her, tell us that, in the interval between the third and fourth acts, Syrus has been present at the interview between Chremes and Antiphila within. The only difficulty in this doctrine is how to reconcile to it the apparent ignorance of Syrus, which he discovers at the entrance of Clinia. But this objection, says she, is easily answered. Syrus having partly heard Antiphila's story, and finding things take an unfavourable turn, retires to consider what is best to be done. But surely this is a most unnatural impatience at so critical a juncture: and after all, would it not be better to take up the matter just where Terence has left it, and to suppose that Syrus knew nothing more of the affair than what might be collected from the late conversation between Chremes and Sostrata, at which we know he was present; and which at once accounts for his apprehensions, which he betrayed even during that scene, as well as for his imperfect knowledge of the real state of the case, till apprized of the whole by Clinia? This unexpected incident has driven My forces into such a narrow pass, I cannot even handsomely retreat Without some feint, to hinder our old man From seeing that this wench is Clitipho's. As for the money, and the trick I dreamt of, Those hopes are flown, and I shall hold it triumph, So I but 'scape a scouring.âCursed Fortune, To have so delicate a morsel snatch'd Out of my very jaws!âWhat shall I do? What new device? for I must change my plan. âNothing so difficult, but may be won By industry.âSuppose, I try it thus. [thinking. â'Twill never do.âOr thus?âNo better still. But thus I think.âNo, no.âYes, excellent! Courage! I have it.âGood!âGood!âBest of all!â â'Faith, I begin to hope to lay fast hold Of that same slipp'ry money after all. SCENE II. Enter CLINIA at another part of the Stage. Clin. Henceforward, Fate, do with me what thou wilt! Such is my joy, so full and absolute, I cannot know vexation. From this hour To you, my father, I resign myself, Content to be more frugal than you wish! Syrus, overhearing.] 'Tis just as I suppos'd. The girl's acknowledg'd; His raptures speak it so.â[going up.] I'm overjoy'd, That things have happen'd to your wish. Clin. O Syrus! Have You then heard it too? Syrus. I heard it? Ay: I, who was present at the very time! Clin. Was ever any thing so lucky? Syrus. Nothing. Clin. Now, heav'n so help me, I rejoice at this On her account much rather than my own, Her, whom I know worthy the highest honours. Syrus. No doubt on't.âBut now, Clinia, hold awhile! Give me a moment's hearing in my turn. For your friend's business must be thought of now, And well secur'd; lest our old gentleman Suspect about the wench. Clin. O Jupiter! [in raptures. Syrus. Peace! [impatiently. Clin. My Antiphila shall be my wife. Syrus. And will you interrupt me? Clin. Oh, my Syrus, What can I do? I'm overjoy'd. Bear with me. Syrus. Troth, so I do. Clin. We're happy, as the Gods. Syrus. I lose my labour on you. Clin. Speak; I hear. Syrus. Ay, but you don't attend. Clin. I'm all attention. Syrus. I say then, Clinia, that your friend's affairs Must be attended to, and well secur'd: For if you now depart abruptly from us, And leave the wench upon our hands, my master Will instantly discover, she belongs To Clitipho. But if you take her off, It will remain, as still it is, a secret. Clin. But, Syrus, this is flatly opposite To what I most devoutly wish, my marriage. For with what face shall I accost my father? D'ye understand me? Syrus. Ay. Clin. What can I say? What reason can I give him? Syrus. Tell no lie. Speak the plain truth. Clin. How? Syrus. Every syllable. Tell him your passion for Antiphila; Tell him you wish to marry her, and tell him, Bacchis belongs to Clitipho. Clin. 'Tis well, In reason, and may easily be done: And then besides you'd have me win my father, To keep it hid from your old gentleman. Syrus. No; rather to prevail on him, to go And tell him the whole truth immediately. Clin. How? are you mad, or drunk? You'll be the ruin Of Clitipho: for how can he be safe? Eh, Sirrah! Syrus. That's my masterpiece: This plot Is my chief glory, and I'm proud to think I have such force, such pow'r of cunning in me, As to be able to deceive them both, By speaking the plain truth: that when your father Tells Chremes, Bacchis is his own son's mistress, He shan't believe it. Clin. But that way again You blast my hopes of marriage: for while Chremes Supposes her my mistress, he'll not grant His daughter to me. You, perhaps, don't care, So you provide for him, what comes of me. Syrus. Why, plague! d'ye think I'd have you counterfeit For ever? but a day, to give me time To bubble Chremes of the money.âPeace! Not an hour more. Clin. Is that sufficient for you? But then, suppose, his father find it out! Syrus. There is a remarkable passage in Arrian's account of Alexander, lib. 4. where he tells us that some embassadors from the CeltÃ¦, being asked by Alexander, what in the world they dreaded most, answered, ????????, ?????? ? ??????? ?????? ???????, âthat they feared, lest the sky should fall.â Alexander, who expected to hear himself named, was surprised at an answer, which signified that they thought themselves beyond the reach of all human power, plainly implying that nothing could hurt them, unless he would suppose impossibilities, or a total destruction of nature. Patrick. Suppose, as some folks say, the sky should fall! Clin. Still I'm afraid. Syrus. Afraid indeed! as if, It was not in your pow'r, whene'er you pleas'd, To clear yourself, and tell the whole affair. Clin. Well, well, let Bacchis be brought over then! Syrus. Well said! and here she comes. SCENE III. Enter BACCHIS, PHRYGIA, &amp;c. at another Part of the Stage. Bacch. Upon my life, This Syrus with his golden promises Has fool'd me hither charmingly! Ten MinÃ¦ He gave me full assurance of: but if He now deceives me, come whene'er he will, Canting and fawning to allure me hither, It shall be all in vain; I will not stir. Or when I have agreed, and fix'd a time, Of which he shall have giv'n his master notice, And Clitipho is all agog with hope, I'll fairly jilt them both, and not come near them; And master Syrus' back shall smart for it. Clin. She promises you very fair. Syrus. D'ye think She jests? She'll do it, if I don't take heed. Bacch. They sleep: i'faith, I'll rouse them. Dormiunt; ego pol istos commovebo. Hedelin interprets these words literally; but surely nothing can be more plain, from the whole tenor of the scene, than that they are merely metaphorical, as Menage justly argues. Hark ye, Phrygia, Did'st note the villa of Charinus, Villam Charini. This passage alone is a sufficient proof that the feast of Bacchis, mentioned in this play, was the Dionysia in the fields; and consequently that the scene is not laid in Athens, but in the country. Dacier. which That fellow just now shew'd us? [aloud. Phry. I did, Madam. Bacch. The next house on the right hand. [aloud. Phry. I remember. Bacch. Run thither quickly: for the Captain spends The Dionysia there. [aloud. Syrus, behind.] What means she now? Bacch. Tell him I'm here; and sore against my will, Detain'd by force: but that I'll find some means To slip away and come to him. [aloud. Syrus. Confusion!â [comes forward. Stay, Bacchis, Bacchis! where d'ye send that girl? Bid her stop! Bacch. Go! [to Phrygia. Syrus. The money's ready. Bacch. Then I stay. [Phrygia returns. Syrus. This instant you shall have it, Bacchis. Bacch. When you please; I don't press you. Syrus. But d'ye know What you're to do? Bacch. Why, what? Syrus. You must go over, You and your equipage, to Menedemus. Bacch. What are you at now, sauce-box? Syrus. Coining money, For your use, Bacchis. Bacch. Do you think to play Your jests on me? Syrus. No; this is downright earnest. Bacch. Are You the person I'm to deal with? Syrus. No. But there I'll pay the money. Bacch. Let us go then! Syrus. Follow her there.âHo, Dromo! SCENE IV. Enter DROMO. Dromo. Who calls? Syrus. Syrus. Dromo. Your pleasure! What's the matter now? Syrus. Conduct All Bacchis' maids to your house instantly. Dromo. Why so? Syrus. No questions: let them carry over All they brought hither. Our old gentleman Will think himself reliev'd from much expence By their departure. Troth, he little knows, With how much loss this small gain threatens him. If you're wise, Dromo, know not what you know. Dromo. I'm dumb. [Exit Dromo, with Bacchis' servants and baggage into the house of Menedemus. SCENE V. After which, Enter CHREMES. Chremes, to himself.] 'Fore heav'n, I pity Menedemus. His case is lamentable: to maintain That jade and all her harlot-family! Altho' I know for some few days to come He will not feel it; so exceedingly He long'd to have his son: but when he sees Such monstrous houshold-riot and expence Continue daily, without end or measure, He'll wish his son away from him again. But yonder's Syrus in good time. [seeing Syrus. Syrus. I'll to him. [aside. Chremes. Syrus! Syrus. Who's there? [turning about. Chremes. What now? Syrus. The very man! I have been wishing for you this long time. Chremes. You seem to've been at work with the old man. Syrus. What! at our plot? No sooner said, than done Chremes. Indeed! Syrus. Indeed. Chremes. I can't forbear to stroke Your head for it. Good lad! come nearer, Syrus! I'll do thee some good turn for this. I will, I promise you. [patting his head. Syrus. Ah, if you did but know How luckily it came into my head! Chremes. Pshaw, are you vain of your good luck? Syrus. Not I. I speak the plain truth. Chremes. Let me know it then. Syrus. Clinia has told his father, that the wench Is mistress to your Clitipho; and that He brought her with him hither, to prevent Your smoking it. Chremes. Incomparable! Syrus. Really? Chremes. O, admirable! Syrus. Ay, if you knew all. But only hear the rest of our device. He'll tell his father, he has seen your daughter, Whose beauty has so charm'd him at first sight, He longs to marry her. Chremes. Antiphila? Syrus. The same: and he'll request him to demand her Of you in marriage. Chremes. To what purpose, Syrus? I don't conceive the drift on't. Syrus. No! you're slow. Chremes. Perhaps so. Syrus. Menedemus instantly Will furnish him with money for the wedding, To buyâd'ye take me? Chremes. Cloaths and jewels. Syrus. Ay. Chremes. But I will neither marry, nor betroth My daughter to him. Syrus. No? Why? Chremes. Why!âis that A question? to a wretch!â Syrus. Well, as you please. I never meant that he should marry her, But only to pretendâ Chremes. I hate pretence. Plot as you please, but do not render me An engine in your rogueries. Shall I Contract my daughter, where I never can Consent to marry her? Syrus. I fancied so. Chremes. Not I. Syrus. It might be done most dextrously: And, in obedience to your strict commands, I undertook this business. Chremes. I believe it. Syrus. However, Sir, I meant it well. Chremes. Nay, nay, Do't by all means, and spare no trouble in't; But bring your scheme to bear some other way. Syrus. It shall be done: I'll think upon some other. âBut then the money which I mention'd to you, Owing to Bacchis by Antiphila, Must be repaid her: and you will not now Attempt to shift the matter off; or say, ââWhat is't to me? Was I the borrower? âDid I command it? Could she pledge my daughter âAgainst my will?ââYou can say none of this; For 'tis a common saying, and a true, Summum jus, sÃ¦pe summa est malitia. This, as Syrus himself says, was a proverb. Menander probably made use of it in this very play, as the same sentiment is to be found among his fragments, â????? ?? ????? ?????? ?????Â· ? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ???? ???????, ?????????? ??? ????????. The law, 'tis true, is good and excellent; But he who takes the letter of the law Too strictly, is a pettyfogging knave. That strictest law is oft the highest wrong. Chremes. I mean not to evade it. Syrus. No, I'll warrant. Nay You, tho' others did, could never think on't; For all the world imagines you've acquir'd A fair and handsome fortune. Chremes. I will carry The money to her instantly myself. Syrus. No; rather send it by your son. Chremes. Why so? Syrus. Because he acts the part of her gallant. Chremes. What then? Syrus. Why then 'twill seem more probable, If he presents it: I too shall effect My scheme more easily.âAnd here he is.â âIn, Sir, and fetch the money out. Chremes. I will. [Exit Chremes. SCENE VI. Enter CLITIPHO. Clit. to himself.] Nothing so easy in itself, but when Perform'd against one's will, grows difficult. This little walk, how easy! yet how faint And weary it has made me!âand I fear Lest I be still excluded, and forbid To come near Bacchis. [Seeing Syrus.]âNow all pow'rs above Confound you, Syrus, for the trick you play'd me! That brain of your's is evermore contriving Some villainy to torture me withall. Syrus. Away, you malapert! Your frowardness Had well nigh ruin'd me. Clit. I would it had, As you deserv'd! Syrus. As I deserv'd!âHow's that?â I'faith I'm glad I heard you say so much Before you touch'd the cash, that I was just About to give you. Clit. Why, what can I say? You went away; came back, beyond my hopes, And brought my mistress with you; then again Forbad my touching her. Syrus. Well, well, I can't Be peevish with you now.âBut do you know Where Bacchis is? Clit. At our house. Syrus. No. Clit. Where then? Syrus. At Clinia's. Clit. Then I'm ruin'd. Syrus. Courage, man! You shall go to her instantly, and carry The money that you promis'd her. Clit. Fine talk! Where should I get it? Syrus. From your father. Clit. Pshaw! You play upon me. Syrus. The event shall shew. Clit. Then I am blest indeed. Thanks, thanks, dear Syrus! Syrus. Hist! here's your father.âHave a care! don't seem Surpriz'd at any thing: give way in all: Do as he bids, and say but little. Mum! SCENE VII. Enter CHREMES. Chremes. Where's Clitipho? Syrus, to Clit.] Here, say. Clit. Here, Sir! Chremes. Have You Inform'd him of the business? [to Syrus. Syrus. In good part. Chremes. Here, take the money then, and carry it. [to Clit. Syrus. Plague, how you stand, log!âtake it. Clit. Give it me. [aukwardly. Syrus. Now in with me immediately!âYou, Sir, [to Chremes. Be pleas'd meanwhile to wait our coming here; There's nothing to detain us very long. [Ex. Clit. and Syrus. SCENE VIII. CHREMES alone. My daughter now has had Ten MinÃ¦ of me, Which I account laid out upon her board: Ten more her cloaths will come to: and moreover Two Talents for her portion.âHow unjust, And absolute is custom! I am charmed with this sentiment, and still more with the good man's application of it. For in fact nothing can be more ridiculous, than that when a father bestows his daughter upon a man, he must also bestow part of his fortune with her. And as a proof, that custom only authorizes such a practice, in antient times the very contrary was the case, money and presents being given to the fathers by those who demanded their daughters in marriage. MADAM DACIER. I must now Leave every thing, and find a stranger out, On whom I may bestow the sum of wealth, Which I have so much labour'd to acquire. SCENE IX. Enter MENEDEMUS. Mene. to himself.] Oh son, how happy hast thou made thy father, Convinc'd of thy repentance! Chremes, overhearing.] How mistaken! Mene. Chremes! I wish'd for you.â'Tis in your power, And I beseech you do it, to preserve My son, myself, and family. Chremes. I'll do't. Wherein can I oblige you? Mene. You to-day Have found a daughter. Chremes. True. What then? Mene. My Clinia Begs your consent to marry her. Chremes. Good heaven! What kind of man are you? Mene. What mean you, Chremes? Chremes. Has it then slipt your memory so soon, The conversation that we had together, Touching the rogueries they should devise, To trick you of your money? Mene. I remember. Chremes. This is the trick. Mene. How, Chremes? I'm deceiv'd. 'Tis as you say. From what a pleasing hope Have I then fall'n! Chremes. And she, I warrant you, These two or three speeches are differently divided in different editions. I have followed that order, which seemed to me to create the most lively and natural dialogue. Now at your house, is my son's mistress? Eh! Mene. So they say. Chremes. What! and you believ'd it? Mene. All. Chremes. âAnd they say too he wants to marry her; That soon as I've consented, you may give him Money to furnish him with jewels, cloaths, And other necessaries. Mene. Ay, 'tis so: The money's for his mistress. Chremes. To be sure. Mene. Alas, my transports are all groundless then. âYet I would rather bear with any thing, Than lose my son again.âWhat answer, Chremes, Shall I return with, that he mayn't perceive I've found him out, and take offence? Chremes. Offence! You're too indulgent to him, Menedemus! Mene. Allow me. I've begun, and must go through. Do but continue to assist me. Chremes. Say, That we have met, and treated of the match. Mene. Well; and what else? Chremes. That I give full consent; That I approve my son-in-law;âIn short, You may assure him also, if you please, That I've betroth'd my daughter to him. Mene. Good! The thing I wanted. Chremes. So shall he the sooner Demand the money; you, as you desire, The sooner give. Mene. 'Tis my desire indeed. Chremes. 'Troth, friend, as far as I can judge of this, You'll soon be weary of your son again. But as the case now stands, give cautiously, A little at a time, if you are wise. Mene. I will. Chremes. Go in, and see what he demands. If you shou'd want me, I'm at home. Mene. 'Tis well. For I shall let you know, do what I will. [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. MENEDEMUS alone. That I'm not over-wise, no conjurer, I know full well: but my assistant here, And counsellor, and grand comptroller Chremes, Outgoes me far: dolt, blockhead, ninny, ass; Or these, or any other common terms By which men speak of fools, befit Me well: But Him they suit not: His stupidity Is so transcendent, it exceeds them all. SCENE II. Enter CHREMES. Chremes, to Sostrata within.] Nay prithee, good wife, cease to stun the Gods With thanking them that you have found your daughter; Unless you fancy they are like yourself, And think, they cannot understand a thing Unless said o'er and o'er a hundred times. âBut meanwhile [coming forward.] wherefore do my son and Syrus Loiter so long? Mene. Who are those loiterers, Chremes? Chremes. Ha, Menedemus, are You there?âInform me, Have you told Clinia what I said? Mene. The whole. Chremes. And what said he? Mene. Grew quite transported at it, Like those who wish for marriage. Chremes. Ha! ha! ha! Mene. What do you laugh at? Chremes. I was thinking of The cunning rogueries of that slave, Syrus. [laughing. Mene. Oh, was That it? Chremes. Why, he can form and mould The very visages of men, a rogue! [laughing. Mene. Meaning my son's well-acted transport? Chremes. Ay. [laughing. Mene. The very same thing I was thinking of. Chremes. A subtle villain! [laughing. Mene. Nay, if you knew more, You'd be still more convinc'd on't. Chremes. Say you so? Mene. Ay; do but hear. Chremes, laughing.] Hold! hold! inform me first How much you're out of pocket. For as soon As you inform'd your son of my consent, Dromo, I warrant, gave you a broad hint, That the bride wanted jewels, cloaths, attendants; That you might pay the money. Mene. No. Chremes. How? No? Mene. No, I say. Chremes. What! nor Clinia? Mene. Not a word; But only prest the marriage for to-day. Chremes. Amazing!âBut our Syrus? Did not He Throw in a word or two? Mene. Not he. Chremes. How so? Mene. Faith, I can't tell: but I'm amaz'd that you, Who see so clearly into all the rest, Shou'd stick at this.âBut that arch villain Syrus Has form'd and moulded your son too so rarely, That nobody can have the least suspicion, That this is Clinia's mistress. Chremes. How? Mene. I pass Their kisses and embraces. All that's nothing. Chremes. What is there more that he can counterfeit? Mene. Ah! [smiling. Chremes. What d'ye mean? Mene. Nay, do but hear. I have A private snug apartment, a back-room, Peter Nannius observes that the beds among the antients were portable, and produces a passage from the Odyssey, wherein Penelope orders the marriage-bed to be produced, to try whether Ulysses was really her husband, or an impostor, by his manner of acknowledging it; because this bed was formed out of the trunk of an olive, wrought into the apartment itself, and therefore, contrary to the nature of other beds, could not be removed. Westerhovius. Whither a bed was brought and made. Chremes. What then? Mene. No sooner done, than in went Clitipho. Chremes. Alone? Mene. Alone. Chremes. I tremble. Mene. Bacchis follow'd. Chremes. Alone? Mene. Alone. Chremes. Undone! Mene. No sooner in, But they made fast the door. Chremes. Ha! And was Clinia Witness to this? Mene. He was.âBoth He and I. Chremes. Bacchis is my son's mistress, Menedemus! I'm ruin'd. Mene. Why d'ye think so? Chremes. Mine is scarce A Ten-days family. Mene. What! are you dismay'd Because he sticks so closely to his friend? Chremes. Friend! His She-friend. Mene. If soâ Chremes. Is that a doubt? Is any man so courteous, and so patient, As tamely to stand by, and see his mistressâ Mene. Ha, ha, ha! Why not?âThat I, you know, Might be more easily impos'd upon. [ironically. Chremes. D'ye laugh at me? I'm angry with myself: And well I may. How many circumstances Conspir'd to make it gross and palpable, Had I not been a stone!âWhat things I saw! Fool, fool!âBut by my life I'll be reveng'd; For nowâ Mene. And can't you then contain yourself? Have you no self-respect? And am not I A full example for you? Chremes. Menedemus, My anger throws me quite beside myself. Mene. That you should talk thus! Is it not a shame To be so liberal of advice to others, So wise abroad, and poor in sense at home? Chremes. What shall I do? Mene. That which but even now One of the great beauties of this scene consists in Chremes' retorting on Menedemus the very advice given by himself at the beginning of the piece. Dacier. You counsell'd me to do: Give him to know That you're indeed a father: let him dare Trust his whole soul to you, seek, ask of you; Lest he to others have recourse, and leave you. Chremes. And let him go; go where he will; much rather Than here by his extravagance reduce His father to distress and beggary. For if I should continue to supply The course of his expences, Menedemus, Your desp'rate rakes wou'd be my lot indeed. Mene. Ah, to what evils you'll expose yourself, Unless you're cautious! You will seem severe, And yet forgive him afterwards, and then With an ill grace too. Chremes. Ah, you do not know How much this grieves me. Mene. Well, well, take your way. But tell me, do you grant me my request That this your new-found daughter wed my son? Or is there ought more welcome to you? Chremes. Nothing. The son-in-law, and the alliance please me. Mene. What portion shall I tell my son you've settled? Why are you silent? Chremes. Portion! Mene. Ay, what portion? Chremes. Ah! Mene. Fear not, Chremes, tho' it be but small: The portion nothing moves us. Chremes. I propos'd, According to my fortune, that Two Talents Were full sufficient: But you now must say, If you'd save me, my fortune, and my son, That I have settled all I have upon her. Mene. What mean you? Chremes. Counterfeit amazement too, And question Clitipho my reason for it. Mene. Nay, but I really do not know your reason. Chremes. My reason for it?âThat his wanton mind, Now flush'd with lux'ry and lasciviousness, I may o'erwhelm: and bring him down so low, He may not know which way to turn himself. Mene. What are you at? Chremes. Allow me! let me have My own way in this business. Mene. I allow you. It is your pleasure? Chremes. It is. Mene. Be it so. Chremes. Come then, let Clinia haste to call the bride. And for this son of mine, he shall be school'd, As children ought.âBut Syrus!â Mene. What of him? Chremes. What! I'll so handle him, so curry him, That while he lives he shall remember me. [ The departure of Menedemus here is very abrupt, seeming to be in the midst of a conversation; and his re-entrance with Clitipho, already supposed to be apprized of what had past between the two old gentlemen, is equally precipitate. Menage imagines that some verses are lost here. Madam Dacier strains hard to defend the poet, and fills up the void of time by her old expedient of making the audience wait to see Chremes walk impatiently to and fro, till a sufficient time is elapsed for Menedemus to have given Clitipho a summary account of the cause of his father's anger. The truth is, that a too strict observance of Unity of Place will necessarily produce such absurdities; and there are several other instances of the like nature in Terence. Exit Menedemus. What make a jest of me? a laughing-stock? Now, afore heav'n, he would not dare to treat A poor lone widow, as he treated me. SCENE III. Re-enter MENEDEMUS with CLITIPHO and SYRUS. Clit. And can it, Menedemus, can it be, My father has so suddenly cast off All natural affection? for what act? What crime, alas, so heinous have I done? It is a common failing. Mene. This, I know, Should be more heavy and severe to you On whom it falls: and yet am I no less Affected by it, tho' I know not why, And have no other reason for my grief, But that I wish you well. Clit. Did not you say My father waited here? Mene. Ay; there he is. [Exit Menedemus. Chremes. Why d'ye accuse your father, Clitipho? Whate'er I've done, was providently done Tow'rd you and your imprudence. When I saw Your negligence of soul, and that you held The pleasures of to-day your only care, Regardless of the morrow; I found means That you shou'd neither want, nor waste my substance. When You, whom fair succession first made heir, Stood self-degraded by unworthiness, I went to those the next in blood to you, Committing and consigning all to Them. There shall your weakness, Clitipho, be sure Ever to find a refuge; food, and raiment, And roof to fly to. Clit. Ah me! Chremes. Better thus, Than, you being heir, for Bacchis to have all. Syrus. Distraction! what disturbances have I, Wretch that I am, all unawares created! Clit. Wou'd I were dead! Chremes. Learn first, what 'tis to live. When you know That, if life displeases you, Then talk of dying. Syrus. Master, may I speak? Chremes. Speak. Syrus. But with safety? Chremes. Speak. Syrus. How wrong is this, Or rather what extravagance and madness, To punish him for my offence! Chremes. Away! Do not you meddle. No one blames you, Syrus! Nor need you to provide a sanctuary, Or intercessor. Syrus. What is it you do? Chremes. I am not angry, nor with you, nor him: Nor should you take offence at what I do. [Exit Chremes. SCENE IV. Syrus. He's gone. Ah, wou'd I'd ask'd himâ Clit. Ask'd what, Syrus? Syrus. Where I shou'd eat, since he has cast us off. You, I perceive, are quarter'd on your sister. Clit. Is't come to this, that I shou'd be in fear Of starving, Syrus? Syrus. So we do but live, There's hopeâ Clit. Of what? Syrus. That we shall have rare stomachs. Clit. D'ye jest at such a time as this; And lend me no assistance by your counsel? Syrus. Nay, I was studying for you even now, And was so all the while your father spoke. And far as I can understand thisâ Clit. What? Syrus. Stay, you shall have it presently. [thinking. Clit. Well, what? Syrus. Thus then: I don't believe that you're their son: Clit. How, Syrus! are you mad? Syrus. I'll speak my thoughts. Be you the judge. While they had You alone, While yet there was no other, nearer joy, You they indulg'd, and gave with open hand: But now a daughter's found, their real child, A cause is found to drive you forth. Clit. 'Tis like. Syrus. Think you this fault so angers him? Clit. I think not. Syrus. Consider too; 'tis ever found, that mothers Plead for their sons, and in the father's wrath Defend them. 'Tis not so at present. Clit. True. What shall I do then, Syrus? Syrus. Ask of them The truth of this suspicion. Speak your thoughts. If 'tis not so, you'll speedily incline them Both to compassion; or, if so, be told Whose son you are. Clit. Your counsel's good. I'll do't. SCENE V. SYRUS alone. The art and address of this stratagem of Syrus is excellent, and cannot be sufficiently admired. Dacier. A lucky thought of mine! for Clitipho, The less he hopes, so much more easily Will he reduce his father to good terms. Besides, who knows but he may take a wife; No thanks to Syrus neither.âBut who's here? Chremes!âI'm off; for seeing what has past, I wonder that he did not order me To be truss'd up immediately. I'll hence To Menedemus, and prevail on him To intercede for me: as matters stand, I dare not trust to our old gentleman. [Exit Syrus. SCENE VI. Enter CHREMES, SOSTRATA. Sostra. Nay indeed, husband, if you don't take care, You'll bring some kind of mischief on your son: I can't imagine how a thought so idle Could come into your head. Chremes. Still, woman, still D'ye contradict me? Did I ever wish For any thing in all my life, but you In that same thing oppos'd me, Sostrata? Yet now if I should ask, wherein I'm wrong, Or wherefore I act thus, you do not know. Why then d'ye contradict me, Simpleton? Sostra. Not know? Chremes. Well, well, you know: I grant it, rather Than hear your idle story o'er again. Sostra. Ah, 'tis unjust in you to ask my silence In such a thing as this. Chremes. I do not ask it. Speak if you will: I'll do it ne'ertheless. Sostra. Will you? Chremes. I will. Sostra. You don't perceive what harm May come of this. He thinks himself a foundling. Subditum se SUSPICATUR. It is odd enough that Madam Dacier changes the text here, according to an alteration of her father, and reads SUSPICETUR, He MAY think himself a foundlingâand assigns as a reason for it, that Terence could not be guilty of the very impropriety which she undertook to vindicate in the preceding scene. I have followed the common reading; because Chremes, ordering her to confirm her son's suspicions, shews that he understood her words in a positive, not a potential, sense. Clitipho, on his entrance in the next scene, seems to renew a request already made; and it would be a poor artifice in the poet, and, as Patrick observes, below the genius of Terence, to make Sostrata apprehend that these would be her son's suspicions, before she had any reason to suppose so. Chremes. A foundling, say you? Sostra. Yes indeed, he does. Chremes. Confess it to be true. Sostra. Ah, heav'n forbid! Let our most bitter enemies do that! Shall I disown my son, my own dear child? Chremes. What! do you fear you cannot at your pleasure, Produce convincing proofs that he's your own? Sostra. Is it, because my daughter's found, Madam Dacier, as well as all the rest of the commentators, has stuck at these words. Most of them imagine she means to say, that the discovery of Antiphila is a plain proof that she is not barren. Madam Dacier supposes that she intimates such a proof to be easy, because Clitipho and Antiphila were extremely alike; which sense she thinks immediately confirmed by the answer of Chremes. I cannot agree with any of them, and think that the whole difficulty of the passage here, as in many other places, is entirely of their own making. Sostrata could not refer to the reply of Chremes, because she could not possibly tell what it would be: but her own speech is intended as an answer to his preceding one, which she takes as a sneer on her late wonderful discovery of a daughter; imagining that he means to insinuate, that she could at any time with equal ease make out the proofs of the birth of her son.âThe elliptical mode of expression, so usual in Terence, together with the refinements of commentators, seem to have created all the obscurity. you say this? Chremes. No: but because, a stronger reason far, His manners so resemble yours, you may Easily prove him thence to be your son. He is quite like you: not a vice, whereof He is inheritor, but dwells in You: And such a son no mother but yourself Could have engender'd.âBut he comes.âHow grave! Look in his face, and you may guess his plight. SCENE VII. Enter CLITIPHO. Clit. O Mother, if there ever was a time When you took pleasure in me, or delight To call me son, beseech you, think of that; Pity my present misery, and tell me Who are my real parents! Sostra. My dear son, Take not, I beg, that notion to your mind, That you're an alien to our blood. Clit. I am. Sostra. Ah me! and can you then demand me that? So may you prosper after both, as you're Of both the child! and if you love your mother, Take heed henceforward that I never hear Such words from you. Chremes. And if you fear your father, See that I never find such vices in you. Clit. What vices? Chremes. What? I'll tell you. Trifler, idler, Cheat, drunkard, whoremaster, and prodigal. âThink this, and think that you are our's. Sostra. These words Suit not a father. Chremes. No, no, Clitipho, I cannot help considering this as a touch of comick anger. However, all the commentators are of a different opinion; and it is generally imagined that this is the passage alluded to by Horace, when he says in his Art of Poetry, Interdum tamen &amp; vocem ComÅdia tollit; Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore. Yet Comedy sometimes her voice may raise, And angry Chremes rail in swelling phrase. Francis. Tho' from my brain you had been born, as Pallas Sprang, it is said, from Jupiter, I wou'd not Bear the disgrace of your enormities. Sostra. The Gods forbidâ Chremes. I know not for the Gods: Nescio Deos. Lambinus, in his admirable letter to Charles the 9th, accuses Terence of impiety: but the charge is groundless. Nay, had Terence been ever so wicked, he would scarce have been so imprudent as to introduce impious expressions in a play which was to be licensed by the magistrates. Nescio Deos does not imply, I care not for the Gods, but, I know not what the Gods will do. This is farther confirmed by a passage in the fourth scene of the second act. Antiphila, in answer to what Bacchis tells her of other women, says Nescio alias, &amp;c. For my own part (says she) I know not what other women may do, &amp;c. and not, I don't care for other women. Dacier. I will do all that lies in Me. You seek For parents, which you have: but what is wanting, Obedience to your father, and the means To keep what he by labour hath acquir'd, For That you seek not.âDid you not by tricks Ev'n to my presence introduceâI blush The Greeks and Romans were remarkably polite in this particular. They would, upon no account whatever, express themselves indecently before their wives. Religion, policy, and good manners forbad it. Dacier. To speak immodestly before your mother: But you by no means blush'd to do't. Clit. Alas! How hateful am I to myself! how much Am I asham'd! so lost, I cannot tell How to attempt to pacify my father. SCENE VIII. Enter MENEDEMUS. Mene. Now in good faith our Chremes plagues his son Too long and too severely. I come forth To reconcile him, and make peace between them. And there they are! Chremes. Ha, Menedemus! wherefore Is not my daughter summon'd? and the portion, I settled on her, ratified by You? Sostra. Dear husband, I beseech you not to do it! Clit. My father, I intreat you pardon me! Mene. Forgive him, Chremes! let his pray'rs prevail! Chremes. What! shall I then with open eyes bestow My whole estate on Bacchis? I'll not do't. Mene. We will prevent that. It shall not be so. Clit. If you regard my life, forgive me, father! Sostra. Do, my dear Chremes! Mene. Do, I prithee now! Be not obdurate, Chremes! Chremes. Why is this? I see I can't proceed as I've begun. Mene. 'Tis as it shou'd be now. Chremes. On this condition, That he agrees to do what I think fit. Clit. I will do ev'ry thing. Command me, father! Chremes. Take a wife. Clit. Father! Chremes. Nay, Sir, no denial! Mene. I take that charge upon me. He shall do't. Chremes. But I don't hear a word of it from him. Clit. Confusion! Sostra. Do you doubt then, Clitipho? Chremes. Nay, which he pleases. Mene. He'll obey in all; Whate'er you'd have him. Sostra. This, at first, is grievous, While you don't know it; when you know it, easy. Clit. I'm all obedience, father! Sostra. Oh my son, I'll give you a sweet wife, that you'll adore, Phanocrata's, our neighbour's daughter. Clit. Her! That red-hair'd, blear-ey'd, wide-mouth'd, hook-nos'd wench? I cannot, father. Chremes. Oh, how nice he is! Would any one imagine it? Sostra. I'll get you Another then. Clit. Well, well; since I must marry, I know one pretty near my mind. Sostra. Good boy! Clit. The daughter of Archonides, our neighbour. Sostra. Well chosen! Clit. One thing, father, still remains. Chremes. What? Clit. That you'd grant poor Syrus a full pardon For all that he hath done on my account. Chremes. Terence's comedy of the Self-Tormentor is from the beginning to the end a perfect picture of human life, but I did not observe in the whole one passage that could raise a laugh. Steele's Spectator, No. 502. The idea of this drama [Comedy] is much enlarged beyond what it was in Aristotle's time; who defines it to be, an imitation of light and trivial actions, provoking ridicule. His notion was taken from the state and practice of the Athenian stage; that is, from the old or middle comedy, which answers to this description. The great revolution, which the introduction of the new comedy made in the drama, did not happen till afterwards. This proposed for its object, in general, the actions and characters of ordinary life; which are not, of necessity, ridiculous, but, as appears to every observer, of a mixt kind, serious, as well as ludicrous, and, within their proper sphere of influence, not unfrequently even important. This kind of imitation, therefore, now admits the serious; and its scenes, even without the least mixture of pleasantry, are entirely COMICK. Though the common run of laughers in our theatre are so little aware of the extension of this province, that I should scarcely have hazarded the observation, but for the authority of Terence, who hath confessedly very little of the pleasant in his drama. Nay, one of the most admired of his comedies hath the gravity, and, in some places, almost the solemnity of tragedy itself. Hurd's Dissertation on the several Provinces of the Drama. âTerence,âwhether impelled by his native humour, or determined by his truer taste, mixed so little of the ridiculous in his comedy, as plainly shews, it might, in his opinion, subsist entirely without it. DITTO. In the passages, selected from the ingenious and learned critick last cited, are these four positions. First, that Aristotle (who founded his notion of Comedy on the Margites of Homer, as he did that of Tragedy on the Iliad) had not so enlarged an idea of that kind of drama, as we have at this time, or as was entertained by the authors of the new comedy: Secondly, that this kind of imitation, even without the LEAST MIXTURE of pleasantry, is entirely COMICK: Thirdly, that Comedy might, in the opinion of Terence, subsist entirely without the RIDICULOUS: And fourthly, that the Self-Tormentor hath the gravity of tragedy itself. The two first positions concerning Aristotle's idea of this kind of imitation, and the genius of Comedy itself, it is not necessary to examine at present; and indeed they are questions of too extensive a nature to be agitated in a fugitive note: But in regard to the two last positions, with all due deference to the learned critick, I will venture to assert that the authority of Terence cannot be fairly pleaded in confirmation of the doctrine, that Comedy may subsist without the least mixture of the pleasant or ridiculous. TÃ©rence, say the French criticks, fait rire au dedans, &amp; Plaute au dehors. The humour of Terence is indeed of a more chaste and delicate complection than that of Plautus, Jonson, or Moliere. There are also, it is true, many grave and affecting passages in his plays, which Horace in his rule of Interdum tamen, &amp;c. and even âthe common run of laughers in our theatreâ allow and applaud in our gayest comedies. I cannot however think that he ever trespasses on the severity or solemnity of Tragedy: nor can I think that there are not touches of humour in every one of the plays, which he has left behind him; some humour of dialogue, more of character, and still more of comick situation, necessarily resulting from the artful contexture of his pieces. The Andrian, The Eunuch, The Brothers, and Phormio, especially the second and fourth, are confessedly pleasant comedies, and the Eunuch in particular the most favourite entertainment of the Roman theatre. Instances of humour have been produced, by the ingenious critick himself, even from the Step-Mother; and the ensuing notes will probably point out more. As to the present comedy, the Self-Tormentor, I should imagine that a man, with much less mercury in his composition than Sir Richard Steele, might have met with more than one or two passages in it that would raise a laugh. Terence indeed does not, like the player-clowns mentioned by Shakespeare's Hamlet, âset on the spectators to laugh, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be to be considered.â He never starts from the subject, merely to indulge himself in pleasantries, like Plautus and even Moliere, for whole scenes together. His humour always arises from the occasion, and flows from him in the natural course of the fable; in which he not only does not admit idle scenes, but scarce ever a speech that is not immediately conducive to the business of the drama. His humour, therefore, must necessarily be close and compact, and requires the constant attention of the reader to the incidents that produce it, on which dramatick humour often in great measure depends; but would of course unfold itself in the representation, when those incidents were thrown into action. In the present comedy, the character of Syrus, bating the description in the second act, must be allowed to be wholly comick; and that of Chremes still more so. The conduct of the third and fourth acts is happily contrived for the production of mirth, and the situation of the two old men in the first scene of the fifth act is very pleasantly imagined. The deep distress of Menedemus, with which the play opens, makes but a very inconsiderable part of Terence's comedy; and I am apt to think, as I have before hinted in another place, that the Self-Tormentor of Menander was a more capital and interesting character. As our poet has contrived, the self-punishment of Menedemus ends as soon as the play begins. The son returns in the very second scene; and the chief cause of the grief of Menedemus being removed, other incidents, and those of the most comick cast too, are worked into the play; which, in relation to the subject of it, might perhaps, with more propriety, have been entitled The Fathers, than The Self-Tormentor. I cannot therefore, notwithstanding the pathos and simplicity of the first scene, agree to the last position, âthat this comedy hath the gravity of tragedy itself.â Be it so.â[to the Audience.] Farewell, Sirs, and clap your hands!</field>
