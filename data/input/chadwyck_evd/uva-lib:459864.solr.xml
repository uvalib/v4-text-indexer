      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue Our Poet wishes, as I heard him say, That all your Criticks would condemn his Play; Since if for him that kindness you will do, He'll leave off Writing, and turn Critick too: He'll find it then a thing of more delight, To damn a hundred Plays, than one to write. Into your mode he'll quickly too have got, Of finding fault where there is cause or not; Nay, be more pleas'd at all your Plays to hiss, Than but to Night to have your Claps at this. He knows, as well as you, 'tis easier far, To be the Judge than Pris'ner at the Bar. He's yet good-natur'd, for he ne'er was known To hiss at Plays, though worse than are his own: Troth, urge him not, for sweetest Wines, you know, Ill us'd, to sharpest Vinegar will grow: And there's no Tyrant's Rage so fiercely burns, As a hiss'd Poet's, when he Critick turns. Then to this Play let your Applause be shown, If not for Justice sake, yet for your own. FINIS.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT YE FIRST. [Scene I.] The scene a dark grove on ye side of a Rock; at ye Bottom ye Ocean with ships riding is seen. Out of the grove Zoroastres comes attended. Severall spirits ascending and meeting him, all with burning lamps in their hands. Strange sort of noises are heard in the air with flashes of lightning and thunder. Zoroastres comes forward and speakes. Zor. How great's my Pow'r! whose hand Hell's throne can shake And Drousey Ghosts from beds of Earth awake. Pluto himself does frightned trembling stand And dreads his Treasure when I wave my wand. Nor can ye aery spirits, when I call, Resist my charms. Great Heav'n itself must fall. A Chaos when I please, I can Create And bee a Destiny to very Fate. All ye great gods doe tremble when I speak, Dipping themselves in ye infernall Lake. âAlmighty I!â Spirits. Dread Sovereign! Mercy. Zor. Bee gon, dull Feinds! and come again to mee, When you th'Amazed world awaked see. Perhaps those Torches, then, which now you have, May Blaze enough to light them to their grave. DescendâBee gon! [They shake their lamps and descend. Hell sure to see mee Reign must take delight, King of ye Day, and monarck of ye Night. Ha! Daemolgoron walking in ye grove, Melancholy, as if hee were in Love. By chance I may discoverâ[Listens. Daem. Â«Oh, that I Could tell her that I love before I dye! Nor can ye great Zoroastres b' Angry sure To see mee Fall a sacrifice soe pure. Yetâlet him say what hee does please to mee, Cupid's as great a Conjurer as hee. What Man e're greater Magick yet could find, Than in Cyane's Breast if she was kind? Heavens, what glorious thoughts I have! What would my Fathers Circles seem to mee When I lay girded and inclos'd by She? âBut oh my Fears!â Great god of love! Send a bright Cupid down To tell mee my too near Approaching doom.Â» [Falls in a Trance on a Couch. Zor. Â«Bless mee! What have I heard? My son in Love? Curses light on him. Is it come to this? Then in vain have I Studied ye Nature of Astronomy. Yee mighty Planets! What can you now doe, When dull, poor Love more influence has than you? In vain have I ye great worlds Chymist been, And search'd ye Nature out of ev'ry Green. Almighty Love can now bee cur'd noe more By ye Juice of Herbs than 'twas heretofore. âOh! that I should live to see this day! Heavens! Why don't you take my life away? âIf I must live, I'le teare him from her Arms, And, after Death, will haunt him with my charms.Â» [Exit. Two spirits in shapes of woemen clad all in white, with Wands, fly down, and stand before Daemolgoron, singing, who all ye while lays asleep on a Couch. Song. 1st Spir. You that here a Lover lye Shall never a trew Lover dye, But shall change, and like ye wind Love ev'ry one that will bee Kind. Chorus. Come then, o Cupid, show thy pow'r Uppon one that changes in an Hour. 2d Spir. Why should not ye Flames of love Prove as strong as those of Jove? For 'tis a greater sin, they say, Not for to love, than not to pray. Chorus. Come then, o Cupid, show thy pow'r Uppon one that changes in an Hour. Cupid appears above, brandishing a dart; ye 2 spirits fly up to him. And on a sudden ye stage darkens, and ye cave and grove vanish. Daemolgoron, as one amazed, rises and speaks. Daem. What shapes, what Forms, what visions of ye Air, Unto my Lab'ring Fancy did Appear? Cold thick drops of sweat from my Brows distill'd And all ye Bloud within my veins was chill'd. The sluggish God of sleep was 'fraid to come, But stood at distance, hov'ring o're ye Roome. Cupid too (I am resolv'd I'le Love noe more) Sent two white Devils worse than all before. Hence then I will indulge my willing mind, Nor e're again from Pleasure bee Confin'd, For why should I ye visions dread of Night? A Woeman in a sheet can never Fright. [Exit. [Scene II.] The Scene shifts into a Pallace. Enter Oroandes, and Phylander. Oro. Why doe wee loyter here, mispend our time, When Action Calls us to things more sublime? Let's wave ye Court, where nought but Rapines dwell, Hell's old Exchange! Here their false wares they sell; Here stately Beauty Tryumphs, bears ye Sway, Leads ye Fine, Easy, Strutting Fopp Astray! And never leaves, till it does spirit him away. 'Twas but once that e're in Hist'ry wee read That ye Bright Venus durst an Army Head. She too came wounded home, would goe noe more; Blushing, she retir'd, when she saw her gore. Young Prince! What say you? Shall wee goe to war, Tame all ye Nations that doe live afar, Teach 'em Humanity?â Phy. You have my Heart, I'me ready to obey. I'le follow, Sir, wheresoe're you lead ye way. Oro. Spoke like your self, and like my Freind. [Embraces him. But yet suppose wee such misfortune have As in our wish'd for Wars to Find our Grave, Wee cannot by a Nobler way bee great Than when wee Falling grapple with our Fate. If ye bold sons of Earth again should rise And with vast mountains scale ye trembling sckys, Jove, I am sure, to see how bravely wee dy'd, Before his Thunder for to quell their pride, Would nobely court our very souls unto his side. Come, then, my dear Phylander, let's not stay, But tread a rougher and more glorious way. Phy. Gallant Oroandes! Whose Active Soul Extends its valour to ye farthest Pole, All ye great western Kings and Monarks Fear; Your very Name with Trembling they doe hear. Proud Persia 'tis alone opposes you, Or else ye world it self you might subdue. Oro. Oh that proud Persia durst oppose my force! I'de Trample her to peices with my Horse. Phy. When once, dear Sir, they did begin to Neigh, You would bee chosen King of Persia. âYet I doe wonder that she now alone Should bee ye last t'adore ye Rising Sun. When Kings and Emperours court you for their freind, She noe obedience at all does send. Oro. Therefore wee'll all her glory's tumble down, Levell her Turrets with ye humble ground. Fate drunk with bloud shall lead us all ye Round. Enter Juliana, Polynice, hand in hand, at ye other end of ye stage. Phy. Hah! what are those fair things which yonder walk? Oh my heart! my Eyes! how pretely they talk! Oro. Oh! they are woemen! shun 'em, Woemen! Phy. Woemen! noe, they're Angels; look how they shine! Ther's ne're a Part they have, but is devine. When e're ye Oracle did at Delphos speak, A sudden Trembling us'd my joints to take. The same fit now uppon my joints is fell, I Tremble at ye very words they tell, As if their lips were to bee m' Oracle. May I not goe kneel and pray?â They seem as if they'de my Petition hear: Such Angels never will deny my Prayer. Oro. Angels! they're Devils, murderers of men. You see they came out of that dismall den. Â«Hee loves 'em sure. I myself too must not stay.Â» Come, O my dear Phylander, come away, Or else wee both shall bee unman'd today. Phy. By Heavens! I am so fix'd I cannot move! [Courts 'em in dumb shew, and Oroandes turns away. O, stay a little! don't soe cruell prove; I've yet not bid my charming Fair, Adeiue. Stay a little, I'le doe as much for you. Gods! can you goe away and leave mee soe? Let dreadfull wars awhile bee out of mind, And let Fair Venus come, who will bee Kind, And mee another God of War you'le find. Oro. Farewell, then, Freindship, you and I must part. I will not stay when you have lost your heart. âÂ«Who ever thought of this?Â» Phy. Ah! what a Killing Look was there! It came Pointed with steel, and armed with a Flame: I Dye! I Dye! Oh, say what e're you can, Hee that resists such Beauty's more than man. Oro. Yet, yet return, before you're vanquis'd quite; The way to Conquer here, is not to fight. Hearken to reason. Ah, you're quite undone: [Phy. moves on. With much more Safety I'de on Canons run. To war, to war I am resolv'd I'le goe, And never think of Love but as a Foe, Whilst you, poor soul, with crooked knee must bend And always on your Mistris's pleasure tend. Our Knot of Freindship too in Love will end. Adeiue!âYou are resolv'dâ Phy. To love. Oro. Farewell For ever too. [Exit. Phy. Â«Oh, now begins my Hell. It was unkindly done to leave mee soe In ye very midst of ye Insulting Foe! If Wars hee'd lov'd, hee might have stay'd with mee, And have fought hard too for his Victory.Â» Whilest Phylander stands talking to himself, ye two princesses goe off ye stage. As hee goes to follow 'em, two Cupids fly down, and stand before him, one like a handsome boy, ye other a young girl. Boy. Stand still, Rash Youth, and listen. Girl. Ah, my dear Lovely Youth. Boy. Ah, Faithless fair. [Hee runs from her. She follows him. A soft air is play'd. Hee sings. Song. 1 Man. Stand off, vain, wretched, gaudy thing: I hate your willing Faces. Noe more shall you mee careless bring, Noe, not with your dear Embraces. That man's a fool, who's mock'd, yet loves again. The Leading'st Fop you have, wont doe ye same. 2 Woeman. You cannot fool, you cannot leave mee. Look up and veiw my Burning Eyes. Then see you, slave, if you can rise? You cannot fool, you cannot leave mee. [Woeman] (To bee spoken) The smallest hair I have, shall bee thy chain, And you shall live my slave, whil'st I doe Reign. [Turns round, and fly's upp again. Man. (Spoken) Let woemen doe what ere they will, Poor doting man must follow still. [Flys upp after her. Yes, Yes, imperious Beauty! I'le obey And my Devotions at your Altar pay. Butâlet my glorious chains eternall bee That I may never have my Liberty. Juliana and Polynice enter to Phylander. Phy. Â«Once more I see ye Sun, but circl'd round Hee shines, as when with awfull flames hee's crown'd.Â» Forgive mee, Ladys! that I thus intrude; It was my Ignorance that made mee rude. It is but fitting that I then retire [Goeing. And leave this place which gods themselves desire. Poly. Stay, gen'rous stranger! I command you stay. Where Ladys come, d' yee use to goe away? Phy. Our ancient Bards did write, men ought to dye When they approach'd Divinity too nigh. Jul. Heav'ns! Polynice, let's away for fear This impudent unknown should come more near. With foolish Preists hee'l now deceive us more Than e're with Fables they did him before. Poly. Fye, sister, you're might'ly injurious grown. Â«I wish hee still had been ye fair unknown.Â» [Apart. Phy. Hah, charming fair! to whome must I now pray? At what bright Altar must my victim lay? Or with th'Athenians must I worship blind Gods, as unknown to mee, as I to them? Ah, let then Ignorance noe more protect What otherwise might well bee thought neglect. Poly. You look on mee soe much, as if you were Train'd up only in ye Rough Courts of war. Tell mee first what you are, and whence you came, Soe you'le obleige mee too, to speak my Name. Phy. Madam, ye thing which made mee here resort Was but to learn ye language of your court. My Name's Phylander and my father Reigns Over ye great and large Pharsalian Plains, Renown'd for Battlesâ Soe many thousands there one day did fall That it could scarce suffice for graves for all, Where Rigid fate, that she might tryumph more, Put on her robes purpl'd with humane gore. âBut why doe I talk of such dreadfull things, Of slauter'd monarcks and of murther'd Kings? Such Subjects are not fit for you to hear. Poly. The telling of 'em, Sir, I never fear. I pity those brave men, which you doe say Soe early and untimely dropt away. A better fate they should have had, if I Had had ye ord'ring of their destiny. Phy. Ah, happy youths! I envy now your fall. I wish that I had perish'd for you all. Poly. Pity's ye least wee ought for to bestow On those, who perish'd by our Countrey's foe. The Gods would doe but right, if they'de restore What by severe decrees they took before. Phy. Ah, then, you charming Fair! compassion shew And something for your wretch'd Phylander doe. Pity those wounds which your fair eyes did dart Nor doe disdain ye off'ring of my Heart. Poly. Â«What shall I doe? Love will prevail, I fear, [Apart. Soe that I shall not half incens'd appear. Bear up, my heart, I'le try.Â» (To Phy.) How dare you, Sir, talk of love to mee! [Imperiously. Wretch! Slave!âthen goe and from my Presence fly. The next minute that I see you you must dye. [Milder. Jul. I told you hee was mad when first hee came. Poly. Who would have thought he durst have told his flame! Court mee? a stranger? one that I don't know? Court mee again!âCome, sister, let us goe. Enter Trivia. Tri. Ladys, your father waits for you within And wonders that you will this day bee seen. Phy. Heavens! that I should live to injure her Whome before all ye Earth I doe prefer. Forgive but now, I'le ne're again declare. I'le wander where ye silent kingdoms are; Thus, Madam, I will free you from my Love. [Draws. (To Oro.) Oh, my dear freind, doe not soe cruel prove. [Looks back and sees Oroandes who hinders him. It is her pleasure and she thinks it good That my bold Crime I expiate with blood. Noe longer, then, my glorious fate withstand, But let mee bleed it all. Poly. Hold! stop your hand. 'Tis not thy life of thee that I require; I am contented, that you would expire. (To Jul.) Come, sisterâ Oh! I have something that lyes heavy here. [Points to her breast. Jul. I wish that Prince Phylander bee not there. [Exeunt, Poly. looking back. [Manent Oroandes and Phylander. Phy. My Angel's gone. Had it not been for you My soul had went unto her Heaven too. Oro. Is this your love? For shame, ne're love again, But put a period to ye Tyrants Reign; Never let Loves false light seduce you soe. If I was you, I'de stab him at a blow. Hee is unwise that once has shipwrack'd been And yet will venture for ye sea again. How great's then your insatiable desire, That being scorch'd doe yet dread ye fire? Phy. Oh, doe not mee soe cruelly upbraid Nor speak against that fair, and charming Maid. Bid men in feavours from their drink dispence Or teach ye Raging mad how to talk sence, As soon may you persuade mee not to love. Oro. There's noe one wise your Passion will approve. Phy. The wise doe love at first, but loose again What their strict former wisdome did obtain. Th'Almighty Jove in love became a sot And that hee e're the Thund'rer was forgot. 'Tis Religion then in us for to approve That which our glorious Gods themselves doe love. Oro. Hold, Heretick to war! I myself will goe. All Cupids statues to ye ground I'le throw, Nor e're to's carved image will I bow. When this I've done, I'le fight th'unbearded boy, With his own flames his Godship will destroy, And with my own, if I him conquer doe, I shall revenge great war's god's quarrell too. [Exit. Phy. If ever any thing could love provoke, You sure can never miss ye dreadfull stroke. [Exit. [Scene III.] The Scene shifts to a pleasant Orange Grove. Enter Cyane. Cy. Shall poor Cyane never bee at rest? Always have ye Tormentor in her breast? Thou Legion Love! Great and Powerfull God! Who rulest the trembling world but with a Nod, If thou would'st have mee pray unto thy shrine, Strike Oroandes that hee may bee mine. To her Daemolgoron. Â«Here's ye worst of all my Tormentors come, One that will never let mee bee alone!Â» Daem. Divine! Adored! Cy. What! are y' about to pray? If that bee your design I'le goe away. Daem. To worship here I came, and here I find [Bows to her. My Glorious Goddess, if she'le bee but kind. May ne're a blast arise that may convey My Prayers, as they doe come to her, astray. My Duty bids mee to ye Gods to bow, But Love won't all my pray'rs to Heav'n allow. Much to ye Gods, but more to greater Love I owe. [Bows to Cy. Heavens! Cy. What silent gods does hee adore? [She stands unconcerned. Who can bee deaf when he soe loud does roar? Daem. Gods! Cy. Methinks they are very deaf today, Or else they will not hear what you doe say. Sure, Sir, you have but small acquaintance there, Or else your gods ill manner'd must appear To dare to deny a Gentleman's Pray'r. Doe yee come soe often? Daem. I'le pray noe more, Nor e're again your Ladyship adore. [Stamps. âWhat an ill Humour you are in today! [Pauses. Cy. 'Tis my ill Genius leads me soe away. Yet since you are soe stout, you this I'le tell: [Turns to him. My spirit ne're with Conjuring you'll quell. [Exit. Daem. If ever I again to Love incline! Mayâhold, how quickly I doe change my mind! Well, I've found a trick I am sure will doe; Her haughty spirit now to mee shall bow. I'le lay her spirit with my Golden Charms And embrace pleasure with my open arms. Heav'ns great Emperour this receipt did use When hee ye guarded virgin did abuse. The great and mighty Brazen walls were torn; Nought could resist ye brave and glitt'ring form; The Port itself was taken in ye storm. And that my pleasure too I may obtain I will call back ye golden age again. Enter one of ye guards. Guard. Your Father, Sir. Daem. Slave! How dare you t'intrude? Guard. The king, Sir, sent mee. Daem. Not to bee soe rude. Retire. [Exit Guard. Let my dull, aged, doting Father come. How long must hee bee troubl'd with a crown? Enter King Zoroastres attended. Hail, mighty Sir! Methinks I see a light shine round your Head, A burning crown with brightest glory's spread. Why should not you, O Father, bee a god? Â«O that in Heav'n you had but your abode!Â» [Apart. For all ye Angels you as God obey, And if you say ye word, they come away. Â«Sure I may tell him now that I doe love.Â» Great Sir, may I a question to you move? 'Tis Easeyâ Zor. Well, what is't? Daem. I dread to tell. If I should say I love ye fairâ Zor. Heav'ns! Hell! Is this your question, a very easy one? Daem. Oh, Sir, bee'nt angry and I will bee gone. Since you condemn my love, I will retire And veiw with scorn, what once I did admire, Yet if you did but know whom I adore, Sure you could not bee angry any more. Zor. S'death, still? Who doe you think I am? Daem. A Father. Zor. If you don't take care, a King. Love! which you know I hate as I doe blood, Nor e're by you would have it understood. Yet in Cyane you can day and night In spight of my Commands take your delight. Goe, Rebell, Slave! goe! to Cyane goe And see, you wretch, what she for you can doe; As long as you a Passion for her own, You'le loose your Title to your Fathers Crown. [Exit. Daem. Cyane! how did hee come to know her Name, Or that 'twas her to whome I paid my flame? Some envious devill of his this needs must tell. O that hee and all his Dev'ls were in Hell! Shall I my love then pass soe silent by, And tamely see my poor Cyane dye? Assist mee, Love, with all thy mighty power, And see what I will act within this hour. Why should I not love?â It is noe policy to lay that down Which may, if manag'd well, bee worth a crown. O, if I in this pious work doe speed, Loves Altars sacrifice shall never need! Give mee but once my love, my Father dead, Let Jove dart all his thunders at my head. I'le act ye Roman and will slip to bedd. [Exit. The End of ye first Act.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE 2D ACT. [Scene I.] The Scene drawn, Oroandes is discover'd laying asleep uppon a Couch, when presently ye Heavens open, wherein ye Temple of Cupid appears. After divers sorts of Musick heard above, Cupid descends with 2 darts in his hands, one of jealousy, ye other of despair. Hee goes round Oroandes, at last sticks 'em both in him; which done he flys upp. Divers spirits meeting him. Hee sings this song when hee goes round Oroandes. Song. Cupid. How sweet is Revenge to our Godship above, To those that bee stubborn, and Rebels to Love! Poor Mortals of Beauty shall stand in such awe, That what is their Pleasure shall hence bee their Law. Chorus of Spirits. May they perish by disdain And ne're bee lov'd again, All they which scorn your flame. Cupid. Let jealousey his Companion bee. When hee too does sob, and cry And at ye feet of's Mistress lye, Let him nere regain his Liberty. For Mortalls of Beauty shall stand in such awe That what is their pleasure shall hence bee their Law. Chorus of Spirits. They shall perish by disdain And nere bee, etc. They all fly upp singing, and ye Heavens close. Soft Musick is heard as they fly upp. Oroandes rises and takes ye darts and breaks 'em, and then speaks. Oro. Why, foolish God, do'st thou torment my breast And soe abruptly break mee of my rest? [Hee falls asleep again. A Vision appears to him in ye shape of Polynice, and pulls him. Hee wakes. Bee gon, fantastick image of ye Night! Thou vain deluder of m'imposed on sight! Aery nothing! [Hee falls asleep again. The Vision comes again and pulls him, and then vanishes; at which he rises and speaks. Hah! Come again! Heavens! for me it sure does something mean, There's something in it yet besides a dream. How my Soul burns and akes! Oh! I have lost my Courage with my Heart, And Love at length has tryumph'd with his darts. Who could resist that dazeling, glorious light? Noe mortall sure could ever shine soe bright. Come then again, thou sweet, deluding fair! And tell mee where thy aery mansions are. Then wing'd with swiftest love, to thee I'le fly, And always in thy bosome melting lye; Noe god shall love soe well in all ye scky. All ye brisck sprights of heaven shall admire, To see us keep soe long our sacred fire. Had but Prometheus stay'd to see us reign, From us he would have borrowed his flame. Enter Polynice. Poly. Ohooâ [Goeing out. Oro. Â«O, this is shee. Ye bright vision's here; With ye same awfull dread does too appear.Â» Stay, glorious Fair! ah, whither doe you goe? Why doe you shun mee who am not your foe? I who against great Love did once design All my high thoughts to bloody war incline, Am now a Votary to fair Venus shrine. [Bows to her. Beleive mee, Madam, and I glory too That to such Beauty I my Conquest owe! Poly. If Polynice you ever yet did see, You durst not, Sir, thus talk of love to mee. Ev'ry petty, forreign Prince that does come here, Although they know before I am severe And use with stricktest rigour to appear, Yet to my face they dare declare their love And feign would have mee what they say approve. By Heavens Thunder I am resolv'd, if ere I can, I'le kill And all their blood unto my Beauty spill. Oro. O direfull words! Poly. Thou wretch! how dar'st thou look mee in the face! I thought I could have kill'd thee in ye place. Sure all my pointed charms are gone today Or you could not soe impudently stay. Oro. 'Tis Oroandes, Madam, does implore, [Kneels. 'Tis Oroandes, Madam, does adore. Poly. Rise, Prince. 'Tis not fit you kneel. Oro. You cannot sure soe tyger cruell prove As for to think that I am not in love. By all th'innumerous gods! Shall I swear? Poly. You may bee perjur'd if you don't take care. Oro. It is impossible in a cause soe just. As soon may Heavens light forgoe his trust. Poly. I must not love, nor can you mee Injoy. Oro. Oh, don't soe quickly all my hopes destroy. Sure a little you may love; doe but try. A little will suffice untill I dye. Poly. By Heavens I can't! what would you have mee doe? I've not a spark of love now left for you; Therefore in time withdraw your fruitless love, And your great soul with nobler Passions move. What souldier would yet fling his life away When ye Commanders did keep back his pay? In vain you lay your seige ye fort to win, In vain you did this enterprise begin. It is already stoutly man'd within. [Exit. Oro. She's gon, she's gon! What shall I doe? She's gon! My eyes grow dark, and can pursue noe longer. [Raving. The mist grows thicker, and rolls in clouds. âOh, my sick heart! [Milder. What seige, what fort, what enterprise had I? And under what commander must I dye? Too late, great Cupid, I thy pow'r doe find. Despair already seazes on my mind, And I'me to melancholy thoughts inclin'd. [Exit. [Scene II.] Scene Ye Pallace. Enter King Zoroastres, Ambassadour as from Persia, with Attendants. Zor. Are these ye reasons hee gives for his invasion? Won't hee goe back?âwhy will hee perish? Goeâunblind his ambition. I pity his youth, Will yet forgive and treat him as my brother King. But if hee will engage and won't retire, Destroy my Kingdomes still with sword and fire, It shall bee war and must! Am. I accept it. It shall bee war. [Exit. To ye King, Phylander, Daemolgoron, Polynice. Zor. News unto you, first sons of fame, I bring From ye proud, insulting Persian King. Grown arrogant because of his long ease, Hee has basely broken our long kept peace, Invaded our Dominions with sword and fire! Goe then, my son, and all our forces call, Muster up old and young, ye low and tall, For like myself I am resolv'd to fall. Daem. Vict'ry soe long, Sir, has been us'd to you That she'le bee asham'd to forsake you now. Zor. On, then, brave Hero's! and with dreadfull sound Like Earthquakes, let your drums tear upp ye ground, And waken Fate. Make Nature startle at your loud Allarmes, And nobely bath in humane gore your Arms. Let not poor pity once come in your mind, Nor ever have a thought of beeing kind. Cut them peices, when they groveling lye; As they basely liv'd, let them basely dye. Daem. All your severe commands I will fullfill. Ten thousand of their lives to you I'le spill. Zor. Yet bee not rash in following your foe. An empire's too much for one single blow. [Exit Daemolgoron. Phy. Nor I, dread sov'reign, will here idle stay; Honour and glory both doe call away. Methinks ye battle is by both begun. My blood does boil within mee to bee gon. Noise of drums and hollowing. Such noises waked mee in my infant cradle, And kept mee from sleeping into softness. Zor. Ha! brave Ally!âgoe, pursue your victory. 'Tis not with men you'le fight, but luxury. [Embraces him. Exit. Phy. Thy declining state, O Persia, I pity. Riches and gaudy arms won't bribe our honest fates. They're not to bee tempted, nor will they spare, And if for crouds, our vict'ry stands at stay, I'le in and with my sword hue out her way. Fate shall rejoice to see soe great a flood, To see them close their dying eyes in blood. Wing'd thus with hopes, unto ye camp I'le fly, Not teach them how to live, but how to dye. Poly. Who then must stay for to defend us here? Phy. There's noe one, Madam, will affront ye fair. Poly. O, my Phylander, can you leave mee soe? Phy. Heaven knows how unwillingly I goe! With what reluctance I doe part with you. Poly. Oh, 'tis easey, very easeyâ Some Persian dame noe question but you'le find. How then should I injure you if she's kind, To make you tarry here with mee behind? Noe, noe, goeâI ne're will stay you sure. [Weeping. Phy. Break, break my heart, how can'st thou this endure? What Pity is't such glitt'ring pearls as these Should bee found always in the wat'ry seas! Weep, fair, noe more. Enough we understand How much ye sea is richer than ye land. OhâMadam, I shall ne're endure to fight As long as youâ Poly. âdoe tarry in my sight. As I doe know I'me troublesome to you, Forever then, forever, oh, Adeiw! [Goeing. Phy. Stay, cruell fair, I doe conjure you, stay. 'Tis glory calls and hastens mee away. Poly. Pursue your glory, but let mee alone. Goe, post away, or else she will bee gon. Phy. Oh, forbear! ev'ry word does stab my Heart. It is ingratitude, I know, to part, Butâ Poly. I doe not ask that you should stay with mee, You then would loose your share in victory. Noe, follow arms; let glory still controul That lordly tyrant of your warlike soul. Yet still remember what to mee you owe, And doe not all your life on fame bestow. Adeiwâ[Exit. Enter Oroandes and overhears her ye two last verses. Phy. Â«She's gon; and now my soul's return'd again, With wondrous vigour does begin to reign. With pride and state I'le view bright beautys charms. Loves tender voice will drown in wars Alarms.Â» [Exit. Oro. Yes, yes, it's trewâit must be soe, I'me sure. Hee loves!âWho can a Rivall freind endure? Is this that mighty foe that was enter'd in? Has Phylander false to Oroandes been? Enter Juliana, Cyane, Polynice. Gods! but I beleive there's none at all. If such, I'le make them come when I doe call, Or unhinge all their temples when I fall. [Goeing out. Jul. Oroandes, stay! [Oro. turns about and meets 'em. Â«How vast a courage does hee seem to have, [Apart. Who dares ye mighty gods themselves outbrave! It will bee hard for to resist, I find, All those rare beautys of his god-like mind.Â» Heaven sure, Sir, sent you for to defend, And to bee our distressed countreys freind. You been't, I hope, for wars. Cy. Enough already to ye wars are gone, Methinks you might stay here with us at home. Poly. Who then must lead our Fainting Armys, And show them victory, if you detain this brave Generall? Then let him goe to war. As well may you ye sun hide in a cloud, As for t'attempt his virtue for to shroud, For war's ye Centre of ye valiant soul, Nor will it let it act what's base or foul. Oro. You need not, Madam, bid mee for to goe, Since I am grown so indiff'rent to you. As soon as e're th'approaching night does come [Raving. And all her sable colours has put on, I'le leave this place and wander o're ye plain Untill I come unto ye Persian camp. There I will kill, and tare all those I meet, Spurning their gasping bodys with my feet; Or leave my carcass on ye heated plain. Their sun, when hee does see that dismall day, Shall bee dismay'd and bee afraid to stay, Shall take his Coach, and wheel, and post away. Heavens roaring Canons shan't sound soe loud As ye dying noise of ye vanquish'd croud. Cy. If as a sacrifice you there should fall, Which Heav'n forbid, what then should wee doe all? Jul. Take care in time, prevent that fatall hour Which all my joys must needs forever sour. Fate when she sees you in such a croud as that, Cover'd with reeking blood and dusty sweat, By chance may not discover who you are. O then betimes bee wise, betimes take Care! Think, think, Oroandes, how dear you bee And see whether you can forsake then mee! For I with blushes this must needs confess, Too well I love you for to tell you less. Oro. This language I could not expect from you, Nor, Madam, can beleive it to bee trew, Soe much it does transcend my hopes. Cy. Â«What shall I doe? I am forever lost! My Love must needs bee by ye Princess crost. His Nature's, too, soe haughty and severe, That my complaints and sighs hee'le never hear. Then to my dying hour I will conceal And ne're that I a lover was, reveal.Â» [Exit. A warlike noise is heard afar off. Poly. Ha! what unusuall noise is this I hear? Jul. Louder stillâsome danger's nigh, I fear. Oro. You need not as long as I have this. [Draws. Stand thus. [Pulls ye Ladys behind him. Now let Heav'n itself with thunder sound th'alarm, I'de keep my station here, my doom await, And 'mongst their thickest swords would seek my fate. Jul. Oh! Heaven send us succour. [Noise nearer and louder. Poly. I scorn to shrink like you when fate does come, I'le out, I am resolv'd, and face my doom. My guard is innocence. [Exit. Jul. Oh, stay, my Oroandes, don't you goe. Sure you, like her, will not forsake mee too. Oro. I'le stay and, Madam, ye whole world defye, Think it an honour too for you to dye, And if by fate I am ordain'd to fall, Before you should for others succour call, My very Ghost shall fright, and kill them all. Jul. I never will desire to live, when you for mee Before could think it nothing for to dye. But look! my sister yonder does appear, Nor loaded does she seem to come with fear. Hah! speak. Must wee dye? or bee all things well? Poly. The happiest news you can expect, I'le tell. That dreadfull noise, which, like agues, shook you And cool'd your running blood, was but ye Eccho Of ye approaching Army. The King leads them To ye temple of ye god of war. This day for solemn rites hee does approve: Tomorrow towards Persia they doe move. Nor will ye King declare his royall mind Whom next my Brother hee has cheife design'd. Jul. Â«Now my foreboding fear comes rolling on, [Apart. Nor can it with ye rising Tempest down. I know hee will my Oroandes take And him ye gen'rall of his forces make.Â» âWhy, what's ye matter that Phylander stays? Or what's ye Reason that ye King delays? Poly. Hee thinks it necessary, before they goe, To ask Heav'n councell, what is best to doe. This too is ye Army's Purgation day, Till which is done they cannot goe away. Oro. From yonder vale they come, clad all in white; Nimbler they seem than the swift sons of light. The Preists with burning Tapers come before, Dipping their unstain'd wands in victims gore, Who, crown'd with garlands, freely come along Nor doe they croud with fear into a throng, Veiwing ye Feilds with scorn as they pass by, As if they knew 'twas good to fast before they dye. These beasts which for their Countreys good are slain Shall shine hereafter as stars in Heaven. Here, here they come. [Noise of trumpets. My soul now burns, for Battles does prepare, And has broke through Love for to goe to war. [Scene III.] The Scene Mar's Temple. To Juliana, Polynice, and Oroandes, enter King Zoroastres, Daemolgoron, Phylander, Cyane, with Preists holding wands. At ye foot of the Altar Tapers stand burning, with dishes of blood. The Divan or High Preist takes a dish of blood, and after ye ceremony speaks. H. P. This blood the fates from dying Persia took, And at ye blow th'expiring Kingdome shook And strugl'd with its fate. Zor. Let Heaven bee propitious to my design And all its altars shall with victims shine. H. P. On, Noble King! and all their gods destroy. Poor subject gods, th'ave none soe great as you. Zor. O sacred Divan, tell us the Event. Shall wee bee glorious conquerours, ride in tryumph? See 'em bow their necks, ye slaves cringe and stoop? That will bee brave, and worthy of our Arms! H. P. Tryumphs, and Tropheys shall your war succeed, If all ye bord'ring Princes too doe bleed. Our God loves blood. Zor. Before the sacred temple here, I swear To perform all th'articles of your war. Nor shall their putrid blood bee spar'd by mee, I'le have a drop for ev'ry Deity. Such mountains of dead corps shall heaped lye That Jove shall fear th'invasion of the scky. Daem. The swelling granick floud shall bloody run With sanguine streams and fright their setting sun. With raging Flames wee'le all their Citys burn; The very Heav'ns with smoke shall clouded turn; All their high marble tow'rs shall scorched bee. Soe much of fire Persia then shall see That she shall mistake her own Deity. H. P. Sound then ye horned trumpets, sound away, Outstrip ye sun, and post it with ye day. For why, dread Monarck, should wee longer stay? 'Twas only Rome could conquer by delay. Zor. Advance our Eagles, bloudy let 'em fly; Perch 'em with ye sun; They le keep the aiding gods from coming nigh. Oro. Thy fate, o Persia, is drawing near. Squadrons of armed men doe now appear. All thy great Nobles in this war must dye, And ev'ry one that helps as an Ally. Thy sacred Magi, Gods themselves, must fall As victims, to attone us angry all. Zor. The sun has almost lost ye sight of day, See how hee gallops down ye Milkey way. Hast then, you sons of glory, hast away! These Royall Youths that here by us doe stand Shall share, if they doe please, in our command. Oro. Dread sovereign, as long as here wee stay, 'Tis yours to command, and ours t'obey. Phy. Yes, I will goe, and if I can, I'le gain All those citys which thicken on ye plain. H. P. May Heav'n prosper this your glorious design And all its forces with your armys joine. [The High Preist makes figures on ye ground while they speak hereafter. Zor. Hear then, brave Youths, since you're resolv'd to goe, What 'fore these Altars I doe solemn vow. Hee of you two which acts ye greatest thing, That can ye fairest spoil unto mee bring, Shall of my Daughters haveâ Poly. Hold, father, hold! Promise them mountains of ye fairest gold That ever yet were seen by Mortal Eye. They'le sooner fight for gold than such as wee. Phy. Oh, MadamâI thought you had better known The worth that's due to such Perfection. Let Cursed Gold in Earth still tombed lye! What has gold to doe with poor love and I? May it below with Pluto still remain And never fright mee from my Heav'n again! Oro. Â«Hell! Furys! where are all my spirits gone? Can I still live? and hear him thus run on? I can't. What's freindship?âNothing when great love appears.Â» Draw, Sir [Draws. Phy. HoldâI'le not draw against ye man I love. I'le never soe ungratefull to you prove. Oro. This will not doe. You must and shall, Sir, draw. Poly. Who ever such ingratitude yet saw? Hold, barbarian, stop thy Hand. Peirce my heart If you must have blood, but touch not hisâ 'Tis sacred. As you love, show your Obedience. [Exit. Phy. Yet doe not think, because I doe retire, I ether fear your arm, or dread your ire. Take, take my life, I'le noe resistance make. You cannot miss unless your hand does shake. The King interposes. Zor. Hold, Oroandes, 'tis I your King command. If you but offer, you shall leave my land. Ramm down ye rising Passions of your mind, And leave no relick of your wrath behind; And this I'le promise on my Royall word, Hee of you two who does deserve ye best, Of ye fair Polynice shall bee possest, But hee, that next of you does dare t' offend, Not only looses her, but mee his freind. [Exit cum Phyl. Oro. By merits only if this saint bee wonn, I'le have her 'fore ye yonder setting sun. Jul. Â«Burst then my Heart, Heavens! What shall I doe? Where can ye wretched Juliana goe? Outrival'd by my sisterâyonger too! Curse on my stars! I'le boldly say hee has ungratefull been. Why should I not, and tell him of his sin?Â» Ungratefull Man! are these ye vows you made? [To Oroandes. Remember how you woo'd mee in ye shade. Did not you say, âNoe, I will never part. How can I, Madam, when you have my Heart?â Are not these truths? Deny 'em if you can. Nay, ne're blush for't, thou trew dissembling man! O Gods! that e're you could perfidious prove! [Weeps. Especially to one who did you love. Sayâwhat was ye cause you did remove? Oro. Madam, you said you'de not accept of mine. You bawk'd my flame which did soe glorious shine. Thank then your self. Jul. I can noe longer stay. His very ingratitude will drive m' away. [Exit. Cy. Alas, poor Princess, sh'as my Pity mov'd, To see how unfortunately she lov'd. Oroandes! can you see ye Princess dye, And at your feet an humble sutour lye? It is not handsome. Conquerours should bee mercifull. Oro. I thought, when first she scorn'd my rising flame, She'd had some spirit, but I see she's tame. Enter again Juliana hastily. Jul. Young Prince, you are mistaken, and shall find I'me not soe tame. I'le scorn, I'le bee unkind, And still I'le, I'le bee a Princess in my mind. [Exit. H. P. Noe more of love! Our god begins to frown, Begins to answer in a dreadfull sound. [A clap of thunder. Away, away, you shall not stay this night; I'le see you all goe marching in my sight. [Exeunt omnes. A Martial tune is playd. Enter King Zoroastres, Oroandes, Phylander, Daemolgoron, with swords drawn, with divers Preists who two and two cross ye stage, and close in a round, and sing. Song. 1. Feirce war, feirce war is a coming. The Enemy already is running. Then ha! gallant boys! Why should wee care for love toys? Feirce war, feirce war is a coming. Chorus. When Monarks dye, and kingdomes fall, 'Tis time to have a care of all. 2. Proud Persia is decreed By our arms to bleed. All her Nobles shall bee found Panting on ye blushing ground, In their Purples rolling round. Dreadfull things ye gods intend And for a sign loud thunder send. Chorus. When monarks dye, and kingdomes fall, 'Tis time to have a care of all. [Exeunt. Six spirits rise and dance an antick dance. [Scene IV.] Ye Scene Shifts to an Orange Grove. Enter King Zoroastres. Zor. Soe now I'le satisfye my love. My son, Who is my rivall, I have sent to wars, For I must own it, that Cyane's beauty Has surprised mee, And heated my age into feircest love. But lest you Beautys should think this a sin, [Bows to ye Boxes. Though age without, Thanke jove, I'me youth within. [Shakes himself. Cyane appears at ye other end of ye walk alone. The King meets her. Zor. Madam, whilest you walk here thus all alone, You seem as if you did some loss bemoan. How strangely you are melancholy grown! Can nothing here divert, or please your sight? Why should dark groves bee only your delight? Speak but ye word, ten thousand Cupids here Shall presently in antick forms appear, Headed with ye wing'd and glorious god, Love. Cy. Soe little I am known unto that God, That I'me affraid he'le fright mee with his sight. Zor. Love never sckares wheen hee comes cloath'd in light. But if you dread to see that glorious god, Like great Jove I'le embrace you in a cloud. Cy. Heavens protect mee! I begin to fear. Zor. Heavens are vain, when I ye Jove am here. But why, dear Madam, should you dread my sight? My godship I'le lay by, if that does fright, And bee again a good substantiall man. Cy. I'de rather have you bee a god agen Than act like those strange things which you call men, For I have heard gods favour woemankind. Zor. Then mee a god, or like a god you'le find. Madam, a godâ [Offers to embrace. Cy. Phoo! pray, Sir, let mee goe, For I'me an Atheist to such gods as you. I meant those glorious gods that bee soe high, All those bright things that twinckle in ye scky. Zor. There's none of those are capable of love; They can't love half soe well as I above. Cy. You are mistaken, Sir. Ye glorious sun Already has his love to mee begun. I'me sure hee is in Love, for when I pray, Hee blushing hearkens unto what I say. Zor. Insulting Persia now is turn'd my foe And I have some pretence for what I doe. The sun my Rivall!âHeaven does conspire T'extinguish quite my new created fire. âBut can you love soe gray a god as hee, An one ey'd god! and Hackney of ye scky? Soe ye Fair Semele did Jove admire, And perish'd in that Love she did desire. Other faults too hee has, which I can name. Cy. Doe if you dare. I'le vindicate his flame. Zor. This thought, Madam, will all your hopes destroy. Hee'le rise soe poor, you can't him half enjoy. Cy. 'Tis false,âhee's a god, and shall bee my Lord, Eternally by mee shall bee ador'd. Not only days, but years hee can make night, If hee but pleases for to hide his Light. And if e're I'me his, I'le walk ye sacred ground, Whilest all ye wond'ring gods stand wishing round, When you, poor Monarck, shall bee mortell found! Hee as ye sun shall have ye Reins by day, Whilest I ye night like bright Diana sway. I'le bee his Heaven, and my arms ye sphere, In which hee walks ye circle of his year. Zor. And is there ne're a star that will love mee? Cy. Noe, as long as I am Queen of Beauty. Zor. Is this ye Recompense for all my care, And must my Age bee slight'd by your Youth? Cy. Age is an inconsiderate plea in Love, Always shoots short and flags his Mark. Zor. Hold, Madam. I'me a king, and have been told A Monarck never can bee thought too old, But 'tis my son, who in your heart does thrive, And Rebell like dares reign, whil'st I'me alive. Yet hee shall find, though to that height hee's grown, I'le bee as abs'lute in my love, as throne. Cy. You and your son are both alike to mee, Therefore pray, Sir, let there noe diff'rence bee, For I'me to all Loves a perfect Enemy. Zor. Could I beleive, my Joy would still remain, To think that Youth noe more than Age could gain. But, Madam, Heaven never would bestow Soe great a Beauty only for a show. Cy. What ye great gods, I know not, have design'd, But I am sure to Love I'me not inclin'd. Free is my soul and ranges allâ Noe tyrant thoughts my heart shall ever move, Nor awfull Greatness dare mee into love. Zor. Your hatred, Madam, has rous'd up that rage, Which Love might soften, and would still asswage. Hee that has pow'r, won't love too long in vain. [Turns away. Cy. How! am I threaten'd? dare you m' honour stain? Zor. Urge it noe moreâ Recant what you have said, and say you love, Or I will force you, by immortall Jove. Considerâ Cy. Doe, Tarquin reviv'd! Force mee if you dare. D'yee think I can't bee a Lucrece and fair? Know Tyrant I doe all thy threats defy. 'Tis not in thee to make mee loveâ Zor. To dye. Cy. Death I would sooner take than life with you. Zor. Too much your anger you doe now pursue. The fair I would not willingly offend. Cy. I don't desire you, Sir, to bee my freind Once more I tell you, you pursue in vain. Zor. Madamâ Cy. Why will you force mee to complain? Woemen are naturally soeâmild, soeâstill, That when we're angry,â'tis against ourâwill, But you must urge us on, and still persuade, That wee are only for your uses made. Ah, if by mee they would but once bee rul'd! I durst engage, they never should bee fool'd. [Exit. Zor. Return, Cyane, I'le bee young again. My smother'd love will kindle into flame. But oh! she's gonâand I must follow. âRemember, Gallants, that you have been told, You'de better love when young, than when you're old. The End of 2d Act.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. [Scene I.] The Scene a Garden. Enter Juliana, and Governess. Jul. Begoneâlet me alone, I will not live. Goeâas you hope that I should you forgive. Yet if you e're would mee a Favour doe, Bee but soe kind to Kill mee 'fore you goe. Gov. You ask that, Madam, which I dare not act: It is a Barb'rous and too bloody fact. A Crime! Posterity would ne're forgive. Soe fair a person should for ever live. Jul. Beauty despis'd is a most abject thing. Without Authority what is a King? O noe, I cannot with my honour live; Therefore in vain you doe instructions give. Death too perhaps may kinder to mee prove. Gov. To you it may, but not unto your love. The utmost you can hope for in your Grave Is that perhaps his pity you may have. Live, Madam, live. Once more your future try. Don't vex yourself. Y'ave time enough to dye. Hee is, I swear, a very hard-hearted man If Youth, and Beauty nothing with him can. Jul. All th'Arts I've try'd that e're I yet could find Did but belong to cunning woeman-kind. I open'd all ye tresses of my Hair, Show'd him ev'ry thing, that wee thought was fair. Hee then would sigh, and swear by all above Ther' w's nought soe dear to him as was my Love. Heavens! how much of pleasure then I took! Then I could heat, and Fire him with a Look. Oh!âwhen hee came and laid hisâBurning hand Uppon these snowy Alps, my breastsâ Hee swore noe Emp'rour should him dethrone! Hee was resolv'd to keep that port alone. But now!âGods! he dares hate mee to my Face, And you would have mee live in my disgrace! Gov. Perhaps hereafter he may Love again. Who knows but now hee smothers it with pain. Jul. It is impossible that Love expir'd With ye same Beauty should again bee fir'd. Gov. He needs must Love, I'me sure, if hee did see Half but those Beautys which appear to mee. Try him again, when hee does come from war, And I myself will bee your Leading star: Hee shan't resist, I'le mollifye his heart; Hee's not invulnerable in ev'ry part. Let him bee rough, and stern, as cold as snow, I'le warrant you at last wee'le make him bow. Jul. O my dear Fairest Maid, could'st thou doe this, What rewards would I give! All that I'me worth I'de give to enjoy such bliss, Butâ Gov. What, but?â Jul. 'Tis impossible to enjoy. Myâsister stands, and does my hopes destroy. Gov. Your sister never will your Loves Annoy, For to my knowledge she does hate him more Than ever, Madam, you did love before. Jul. She can't resist him long, nor can she long deny. Hee'le swear hee loves, and then hee'le swear, âI dye.â And she, poor soul, for fear he should doe soe, Which heaven knows hee never meant to doe, Will presently beleive what hee does say, Nor will again soeâfurious turn away. I know, though she may carry it more high, She can resist such men noe more than I. Don't I blush to say I love, and love him soe, That I can't tell what I had best to doe! Gov. How strang'ly loves disorders 'bout us roul! Th'are like Convulsion fits unto ye soul. In vain strong reason dictates to ye mind Which is to mightier love before inclin'd. Jul. I think, I think, and never think enough; Oh! I'me undone, I am lost in thought. Oroandes! Oh! Oroâanâ [Sinking. Gov. Ah! [Screeks out. Why, Madam!â Jul. Hah! Where am I? your hand! I sink,I drown! [Raving. Hold mee fast! O how ye Heavens turn round! And all ye trees goe dancing on ye ground. Yonder's damn'd Venus has my lord by th'hand. AnotherâGoddess does there kissing stand. Gov. Oh, Madam! for Heavens sake, bee more mild. Jul. What? another Rivall? I'le have you too kill'd. Alone I will him have, by all above; None of you all shall cheat mee of my love. Love if you dare: I'le kill you if you doe. The gallant Oroandes you shan't know. Come then, my dear, let's vanish out of sight And wander in ye Labyrinth of Night. [Exit. Gov. Who e're, o Love, can hope unhurt to goe, When they that love soe much are punish'd soe? But hark! ye Royall Musick leads this way. The King is coming, and I cannot stay. [Exit. Enter King Zoroastres, Polynice, with Attendants. As the King enters a Flourish is plaid. Zor. Retire and wait without. [Ye guards goe off. Poly. But, Father, won't you tell mee this your greife? You doe not know but I may find releife. My dear Father! Zor. Forbear, Fond Child, to know. It is a mystery too deep for you. Goe, call Cyane hither. [Exit Polynice. I! whom ye cares of Empire could not move Am forc'd at last to bend t'inglorious love. All my heap'd Glorys must now scatter'd lay, And to this Tyrant love become a prey. [Sits down. Soft Musick above. Enter Polynice. Well, my child, hast found her? Poly. Yes, but soe chang'd, you can't know her. Uppon a mossy bank she sat, and cry'd, âAll this for thee I suffer,â and then Soe many tears gush'd out, that I vow I pityed her, and said you would pity her too. Zor. O child! this pretty thing, when first I took her, And rescued her from her Angry Fathers arms Was perfect innocence, all white, all smooth, Nothing but good, till she was grown upp, And then she was all, allânothing but woeman. Poly. Why? is there any harm in them? pray, Sir, Must not my sister and I bee woemen? Zor. Noe, I'le stop your Age. Poly. Then wee shall never bee old woemen, Father, shall wee? But here Cyane comes. Enter Cyane. Zor. Madam.âÂ«Heav'ns, how I dread her anger now! What dreadfull storms are thick'ning on her brow! S'death, how imperious she looks!Â» Madam. Cy. Sir. Zor. May I ever hope to have your love? Cy. How dare you, Sir, this question to mee move? Love you! after you have such threatnings us'd! How can I love when I am soe abus'd? I cannot, Sir. You are too rough for mee. I have a mind to keep my liberty. Zor. Your scorn too long does last. I cannot stay; Therefore in vain my Pleasure you delay. Cy. Your Threatnings I scorn; I would have you know I'me born with Majesty as well as you. Zor. Since soe ingrateful to my care you prove, By Burning Stix I'le have thy life or Love. Guards! seize that Witch there. [Enter guards and seize uppon Cyane. What think you? Speak. Will you love, or noe? Poly. O dread sir, what d'ye intend to doe? Â«Heavens! What will my dear Phylander say? When hee hears thisâÂ» Zor. Wee are soe kind, that yet repent and live. Cy. Noe, Tyrant, noe! Thou never shall'st forgive. Base! mean spirited king! Thy Passions slave, En'my to all who are truly good, and brave. Do'st think thy guards can ever force my mind, Or make mee ever otherwise inclin'd? They sha'ntâDeath is thy utmost, I am sure. My soul and love are both above thy pow'r. Poly. Â«How gallantly she speaks! S'has mov'd mee too.Â» Sir! Can such Beauty nothing with you doe? Oh! as you ever hope eternall bliss, Free this Fair Creature from her Miserys. Look there, and if you ever lov'd, you must, I'me sure, to soe much innocence bee just. Cy. Noe more, Fair Freind, I'le suffer all alone. You'le make mee greive indeed, should you bemoan. Let ye Old, Lustfull Tyrant have his Will, Nor ever hinder him from doeing ill; I know hee Longs my blushing blood to spill. Zor. Don't think, soe fair one, you shall still have life; I never did intend thee for my wife. Pale death would now a blessing to her bee; Therefore she shall live, but live in misery. Hence with her to ye darkest Cell I have, And after that, perhaps unto her grave. But first I will injoy, and thenâ[Offers to embrace. Cy. You mee enjoy? You ne're shall mee injoy. Arm'd with this weapon, I thy hopes destroy. [Plucks out a dagger. Impotent Tyrant! I can brave thee now, And dash thy love, with a contracted brow. Is it for this you sent my Brother hence? To kill his sister under Loves pretence? For shameâ There's ne're a Tyrant of ye Former Age, Exasperated even with malitious rage, But blushing, would condemn when hee heard told How you mee young did love, when you were old. Zor. Ye gods! Unhand her, slaves! shee must not dye; She's guarded with too great a majesty. Â«Who would have thought I could have cool'd soe fast At a false woemans tearsâfor I'me sure they're false! Soe dropping clouds doe lay ye strongest winds And hollow ye weather'd stone.Â» Quickly, yee Dogs! Madam! can you forgive this crime in mee? Cy. I thank you, Sir, that you have set mee free. Poly. Now, Father, yourself a king you've shown, Nor shall it ever bee by mee disown'd. (To Cy.) O my dear Freind! ye storm is now blown ore, The Roaring Winds lay Breathless on ye shore, And silent sigh that they can rage noe more. Cy. Â«This only Act of his mee more has mov'd Than all his oaths, and vows before, But yet I cannot love, nor can I bear Any of's love intrigues again to hear. I'de first submit to my severest hate.Â» (To Zor.) I merit not your love, nor, Sir, your hate. Your Crown on mee you would but ill bestow; Some Richer Beauty's destined for you. Zor. Madam, is't possible you still can hate? Can all my service nought at all create? Have I robb'd Heaven's gods for this? Of all their tribute pray'r, considerâ Cy. I'me sorry, Sir, I can't repay your love. All your importunitys can't mee move. Pity is all I can, Sir, to you give. Zor. I must have more, I can't on pity live. Poly. Father, you now grow old, you should not love. 'Tis enough for us that passion t'approved. You should think of heaven, and your kinder stars. Zor. To ye great Heav'n love is ye only way: Hee that goes any other, goes astray. (To Cy.) And this is mineâ For I am sure to her may bee given All ye titles that are dewe to heaven. Cy. In vain you doe this Heaven bestow on mee Which you will find a place of misery. You'le find mee, too, as difficult to gain As that great Heaven is. Nay, I'le maintain Earths sons might scale ye Battlements of jove, As soon as you ye Fortress of my Love. [Exit. Zor. Goe, daughter, follow her if you would save Your now despairing Father from his grave. Goe streight, and tell her that for her I dye; Tell in what torments you did see mee lye. Poly. And will she love if I doe tell her soe? I'le tell her all exactly as I know, I'le tell her that you say you're mighty ill, That her unkindness will at last you kill. Zor. Make hast, and presently your sister call. Poly. My sister too? Well, I'le remember all. [Exit. Manet King Zoroastres solus. Zor. O baffled king! [Walks discontentedly about ye stage. Won't she love? dare she tell it to my face? Must all ye Kingdome know of my disgrace? What doe they call mee king for, to bee fool'd? Or that I should bee by my Love controul'd? It shall not bee. I won't myself dethrone To court a subject in my own dominion! By all ye gods! I am resolv'd this night To please myself and surfet in delight, Or I'le break her heart. I! who above and all below command, Can fathom destiny and see ready stand Myriads of spirits, yet can't conquer love. All my great magick can't a woeman move. It is impossible, do what e're you can, A woeman th'rowly should bee tam'd by man. [Exit. Enter Juliana and Polynice at severall doors. Juliana turns away as her sister speaks. Poly. Sister? Nayâsisterâoh what have I done, That you soe mightily should my presence shun? Jul. Sister?âNoeâyou're unworthy of ye Name. Degenerate Ofspring! Poly. What doe you mean? What have I done? The only fault I know, If 'tis a fault, is that I love you soe. Jul. What have you done? You've robb'd mee of my rest, Made mee unhappy ever, and unblest. Poly. Oh! I? Jul. Despair is my companion in the day; The Night with horrour too does pass away. Strange visionary shapes doe murm'ring come; Ghosts haunt my bed as if it were a Tombe. With hollow groans they all beset mee round, And I like Eccho answer to their sound. Whil'st you Narcissus only doe enjoy, To mee hee always is ye scornfull boy. For your dear sake Narcissus only dyes, [Weeps. And what hee lov'd before, does now despise; Hee scorns to see his face in wat'ry eyes. Hee'de still been mine, had it not been for you. Still my dear Oroandes had been true. But now, cruell sister, what have I done? Poly. With patience I have heard you this relate, And am myself ye most unfortunate. Heav'n knows that your suspitions are unjust; If not mee, yet our Freindshipp you may trust. Jul. Why, don't you love Oroandes then? Poly. Noe, I don't, yetâ Jul. Hold, you'le kill mee if you speak, But 'tis noe matter, for my heart will break. Â«Yet! oh! too sure I am she loves him now.Â» How could you tell mee that it was not soe? Poly. I never yet to him did seem soe kind. Did you ever mee alone yet with him find? Why then d'yee think I love him in my mind? Leave then these raving thoughts which only bee Th'effects of mad distracting jealousey. Jul. May I beleive that's reall what you say? Poly. May Heav'n else never hear mee when I pray, When in this thing I am false to you, Or if all that I have said, bee not trewe. Jul. O my dear sister, now I live again, Now I am free from all tormenting pain. Adeweâ Poly. But I forgot to tell you, The King our Father loves, and in's old age Appears possessed with a Lover's rage. Who d'yee think 'tis? Jul. Some Beauty, to bee sure. Poly. One that is not soe old as I, is she. Jul. Can you a yonger than yourself endure? Poly. The King will have it soe, and it must bee. 'Tis ye fair Cyane, and you're to speak. Tell her ye King is dying for her sake; But first you must have his commands. Jul. I'le goe, And my obedience in my pity show. [Exit. Poly. Now to my love some idle hours I'le spend, Think on ye tedious absence of my freind. How long it seems since hee did leave this place! Sure time grows old, and cannot mend his pace. Heavens grant that hee may speedly return, That I his absence may noe longer mourn; For noe one knows but they who lovers are Either what absence is or what despair. Judge, all you lovers, I appeal to you, What 'tis to love, and to bee absent too. [Exit. [Scene II.] Scaen ye Pallace. Enter King Zoroastres. Zor. The Fatall hour is now approaching near, On which my happiness, or her fate depends. My love's soe high, I can noe longer stay. If she was wise, she would not soe delay. She fears my age, and yet she is how cold! 'Tis her damn'd Modesty that makes mee old. With a false Majesty she braves my love And talks as high as Goddesses above. But my bright soul I'le rescue from her hand, And plant it in more kind and fruitfull land. To him Juliana. Speak, messenger of fate, must wee live or noe? Bee not affraid, but tell mee if 'tis soe. Jul. I'me sorry, Sir, that I am forc'd to bring Soe cruell words from her to you, my King. She says, by half she'de rather wed her grave Than ever any of your embraces have. She vows she cannot love. Zor. Then she shall dye. Goe, bid her prepare herself instantly; She has her wish. To her I'le bee soe kind: Tell her ye grave her Husband is design'd. Fool! to neglect my love, and then to dye, As if ye grave was not as cold as I! Jul. You are a Monarck, Sir. Zor. I am. What then? Jul. You should not treat your loves as other men. Zor. I know ye Reason why she won't mee take, She scorns mee only for Oroandes sake, But I willânay, she shall, I'me resolved, dye. Jul. Won't it seem, Sir, an Act of Cruelty? Zor. Noe, 'tis not! If she won't obey my will, What cruelty is't if I her doe kill? Jul. Try gentle means first. Court her with your crown. Put too all your glorious Titles on; Fine things win woemen. Zor. I have already offer'd her my throne, But she does scorn it. Therefore hold your peace, For I'me resolv'd I'le poison her myself, And she shall find, tho she bee proud and fair, What angry and despairing Monarks dare. [Exit. Manet Juliana. To her Cyane and Polynice. Jul. Did you not meet ye King? how did hee look? Poly. Sad omens from his countenance wee took. Hee star'd uppon us, and walk'd still away, Cursing ye Sun that hee did shine today. Into a dismall Cave hee then did goe Mutteringâ âThis night, this night I'le rid mee of my foe.â Cy. This storm, I know, is against mee design'd. Hee thinks for to threaten mee to bee kind, But hee shall know to my eternall fame I only am a Woeman in my Name. Poly. By this, fair freind, yourself ye first you'le prove That ever could resist a Monarks love. I wish my Father would more calmer bee And not use force to love, which is born free. Jul. That you doe love elsewhere, if hee but knew, And Oroandes, perhaps hee would leave you. Because by him you are beloved too. Poly. Fye, sister, 'tis poor to laugh at misery And below your self. Cy. Hah! fair, handsome Princess, you doe not know But I may have his love as well as you. I do not question, mee tho hee should hate, But that on you hee would revenge my fate. Yet, if he wont, I'me sure that Heaven will; Heaven hates bloud, and will revenge it still. Ther's ne're a god but will my cause defend; Therefore repent before they thunder send. Jul. Repentence only does belong to you. If I were to dye, I'de repent then too. Enter Trivia. Tri. Your Father does your presence hence require, And from Cyane that you'de now retire. Poly. Oh my prophetick fears! Fair soul, farewell. I fear that you'le on Earth noe longer dwell. Tri. Make hast. Your father said you should make hast, And not your time in idle prayers wast. Cy. O help mee, Polynice, before you goe, To teach my dying soul what she must doe. Poly. Your life soe strict and soe exactly here You have led, that you need not shed a tear. With this embrace you have my last farewell. Cy. Â«The word departure bares a sence of hell. I see my fate stand yonder with a Bowl Ten thousand spirits waiting for my soul.Â» (To Poly.) 'Tis hard to dye, but much more hard to part; Methinks I goe as if I had noe heart. Oh my sick soul! but, Madam, all is past, And now I'me resolv'd to dye at last. Poly. Blest soul! you'le now forever live above. Bee ever happy in seraphick love. Jul. I dare noe longer stay. Rivall, farewell, And your wrong'd love in ye Elysium tell. Poly. Again farewell! Don't fear by death you'le prove Yourself a Martyr in ye flames of love. Heav'n thinks you're dead, and with its loudest bell [Thunders and Lightens. Already has begun your Funerall Knell. [Exeunt. [Scene III.] The Scene changes [to a Palace Chamber.] Cyane is discovered laying on a couch with a book in her hand. Two tapers burning by her. A terrible Clap of thunder is heard. Severall streams of fire cross ye stage, and ye Heavens open, from which a spirit descends, and sings. Song. 1. From Oresmades ye Great And from Alha, lord of fate, To you, bright Beauty, am I come To tell you your approaching doom. For Venus is angry, who rules all above, And swears you shall dye, because you'le not love. 2. For your fate then doe prepare, And I'le guide you through ye air. Without directions Heav'n to find I'me sure is hard to woeman-kind. Prepare then yourself; I'le bee within call. Methinks it is hard, but Beauty must fall. Hee flys up singing. Soft Musick is heard all ye time, and ye Heavens close again with thunder. Cyane rises from her Couch. Cy. Hah! drops of bloud! my end does now draw nigh, And I perceive by this, that I must dye. Welcome then fate, but know thou can'st not fright, With all thy spirits and with masqued Night, My soul, when she is cloth'd with glorious light. Enter ye King Zoroastres with a Bowl. Come, Tyrant, come. What makes you soe delay? You have your wish. There's nere a sun today. Zor. Madam, I come your Answer now to take, Which will mee happy or you wretched make. Cru'lty and Blood I hate, but must them use If you my offers doe again refuse. But come! I know by this you 'ave chang'd your mind; I'me sure you are too wise to bee unkind. Cy. Ah, cruell Tyrant! doe you think wee can Bee ever kind to a hard hearted man? 'Tis lust predominates thy deformed will, For Love, I'me sure, is more courteous still. Zor. 'Tis you that makes mee such hard measures take, And I am only cruell for your sake. Nothing shall bee more calm if you'le but love; Try mee and see how gentle I will prove. Come, Madam, come. Bee not I gentle now? What is it more that you would have mee doe? Cy. Ah, Sir, I'me sorry that it is too late, For I am now resolved on my fate. Yes, Sir, I am resolv'd. Zor. To love? Cy. To dye. I shall obleige you, Sir, to Cruellty, Your dear Attribute. Come! Zor. Then take thy fate, Mix't with th'ingredients of a lovers hate. [Gives her ye Bowl. She drinks. 'Tis ye first thing I e're to you did give, And am proud, Madam, that you'le it receive. Will you accept too, Madam, of my Heart? I'me mighty liberall before wee part. Cy. Soeânow I shall bee free from all thy rage, From all ye dull, insipid thoughts of age, But stayâI have not yet of Heaven thought. It will not kill mee yet, I hope. B' you sure 'tis death what here to mee you've brought? Zor. Not fate herself can kill more sure than I; Therefore prepare, and bee resolv'd to dye. But yet, lest death should seem serene and kind, Remember what dear things you've left behind: Mother! Sister! the world itself, nay all That you excessive or could happy call. Remember these, and then if you dare, dye. Cy. My soul above such thoughts as these must fly. But goe, that I may have this hour alone And all ye crimes of my past life bemoan. Oh!ânow it gripes! Zor. Then I see 'twas good And was not cheated in't. Cy. Heavens! I feel it raging in my blood. Tyrant! Curst Devill! goe, I hate your sight. Zor. Soe! these are good dying prayers. Cy. What harm did ever I yet doe to you, That your revenge you should with death pursue? Know thisâ If e're a star I should in Heaven bee, Thou too shall'st dye by th'influence of mee. Zor. Thy crimes will hinder thee from coming there, Nor doe I thy poysoning influence fear. Thou can'st not kill, thy beauty now is gone; Noe eyes will dazell at a setting sun. Cy. Upbraiding King! unworthy of thy crown, How long is't since thou tremblest at my frown? Soe great and ill thy crimes have been to mee That at my death they can't forgiven bee. But oh! I come. I can noe longer stay. [Sinks on her Couch. Time calls mee on and hastens mee away. I goe, I goe, but whither I don't know, Whether 'tis above, or whether 'tis below. [Dyes. Zor. Soe now my quiet, sure, I shall possess. There's none can now disturb my Happiness. The Conquering Princes too for fear shall bee At their return imprisoned by mee. Hah! allready I hear their trumpets sound And neighing horses trampling on ye ground. But oh ingratitude! forgive mee now, 'Tis for my interest to have it soe. A troubl'd mind this action cannot bring; 'Tmust bee a stout conscience concerns a King. [Exit. The End of ye 3d Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE IV ACT. [Scene I.] The Scene Bactria. Ye streets all hung with rich tapestry, in which may bee represented ye wars and overthrow of Persia. After severall sorts of Musick heard and acclamations, Daemolgoron and ye 2 Princes enter through a Guard of Souldiers, the Captives following them with their sword points downward. Enter King Zoroastres, attended with his Nobles, meeting them. Zor. Welcome, dear Son! thy Countreys joy and mine. Daem. All to these Princes, Sir, I must resign. Twice did ye brave Phylander save my life Whilst my own men stood looking on ye strife. Great Oroandes, when I was captive led, Restor'd my freedom with ye Gaolers head. The Persian King himself hee slew that day, And opime spoils in tryumph bore away. Zor. Welcome, brave Princes! Guardians of my Crown! You've rais'd my Eagles bleeding on ye ground. Not ye Pellaean Youth breath'd greater Joy When hee subdued the Persian Monarchy; Unhappy Persia who too now dost owe To ye Prince of Macedon thy Overthrow. Phy. If yee proud Persians, Sir, wee did subdue, 'Twas by the Influence wee had from you. With Justice's sword wee fought, and for our Laws. Who ever yet was beat in such a Cause? Oro. Since, Mighty Sir, I've conquered for you And in pitch'd battles did our foes subdue, I hope at last to mee you'le prove soe kind That noe resistance I at home may find. Zor. Great is ye service which for mee you've done, Conquered my foes, and preserv'd my son. Large are your Conquests, but your merits more. Your Crowns and Scepters therefore I restore. Persia is yours. Oro. 'Tis not your gold and scepters I desire; Gold is but dross in loves almighty fire. Nor part of Conquer'd Persia doe I crave; The world itself in this is but a slave. Phy. I ask ye same, and with some justice too, If you remember what I've done for you. Zor. I know my Daughter you doe both desire, But both of you can't have what both require. Oro. In vain Victorious Arms abroad I bore, Since for such mighty deeds you'le give noe more. With unrelenting sword alone I stood And purple dy'd it in whole streams of blood. Their King and all their Gods I captive led, 'Gainst all their thunder did my Army head. Phy. I will not say ye Gods I captive took Or at my stroaks that ye whole fabrick shook, But this I may: through Clouds of smoak I flew And ye whole Army did myself pursue; The stoutest trembled when they heard my Name; All ye great Cytys yeelded as I came, Whilst this, my Rivall, did ye temples take And all ye silent gods with fury break. Helpless Images hee took, but what did I? I took those gods who, when they speak, men dye. I fought soe long that none were there to yeeld; Honour and I together left ye feild. Daem. Both, Sir, soe gallantly themselves behav'd, They scorn'd by each other to bee outbrav'd. Zor. Hast then, my Son. Unto ye Pallace goe And on rich banquets all your Care bestow. Bid my two daughters come, that they may share My Joys with mee, and for rewards prepare. Oro. Stay, Prince Daemolgoron, for I must goe To pay that tribute which to them I owe. Phy. I too will waite on them. Great King, adeiwe. [Exeunt. Manet King solus. Zor. Hee that ye Laws of Empire will maintain Must never think by vertue for to reign. Weak is that Crown set on by vertue's hand; Walls built with blood doe allways longest stand. Arise then, spirits able for to fright, The blackest forms that ever sprung from Night, Arise, ariseâ[Stamps at each word. Severall spirits arise all in black, with ghastly Vizards. 1st Spir. What is't, Dread Lord, for us that makes you send? Pluto was angry, but bid us to attend. Zor. Millions of years to rocks you shall bee chain'd If you bee n't readier when I doe command. Goe then; with hast unto my Pallace fly. I have two princes there by you must dye. Use all your pow'rfull drugs that may them keep; Try watchfull life to captive with your sleep. Secure their bodys. Then cast Magick round, And that noe place at all for flight bee found, Let all ye world bee made inchanted ground. 2d Spir. It shall bee done. Omnes. It shall bee done. [The spirits vanish. Exit King. [Scene II.] The Scene changes to a Rock with woods adjoyning. Enter Oroandes following ye shape of Polynice who still flys from him. Oro. Stay, fairest Nymph! Poly. Oh, stop not, Sir, my flight, But vanish if you can, and fly my sight. Three savage men but now did mee pursue, Who, if you ha'nt a care, will murder you. Fly thenâbut quickly flyâah! [Runs away. Oroandes follows her. Oro. âFly, Oroandes, fly,ââwhat does it mean? My vertue will not stir where nothing's seen. But coward heart! Cans't thou here idle stay, When thy adored mistress calls away? Run then, and succour give, if not too late; Who knows but yet you may redeem her fate? The savages lead Polynice swiftly over ye stage into one of the alleys. Poly. Oh! help me, gentle sir!âAh! [Crys out. Oro. Gods! if soe much innocence you doe neglect, What mortal ever will your aid expect? But hold, I'le goe, for I will ne're give leave That from ye Gods she her Protection have. My then Rivall Godsâ [Hee pursues the savages to a cave which is at ye foot of ye rock. They all vanish and leave him chain'd after dancing round him. Heavens! what magick's this? I cannot move. Sure there's some conjuring today above. All things with walls enclos'd doe seem to mee And I am made a Pris'ner when I'me free. [Sets down. Enter Phylander following ye shape of Polynice. Phy. Bright beauty, stay! you know not where you goe. D'you see those rocks and dangerous seas below? Poly. For Heav'ns sake, let mee my own ends pursue: I shall bee murther'd if I stay with you. Phy. Ah, Madam! noe one sure dare you prophane, Noe one below a god will at you aim. An Atheist would be damn'd without repreive, Should hee such glorys see and not beleive. Poly. Forbear these praises, Sir, for you will see 'Tis not impossible for mee to dye. Ah, yonder come those Monsters. Let's away Unless y' intend that wee should bee their prey. Phy. Fly, Madam, fly, and I will fight them here. [Phylander fights the savages. Polynice runs away. The savages seem to fly and draw him off ye stage. Trew Courage ne're with greatness does appear. Dogs! I would not quarter to you now give If I ye Empire of ye world might have. How could you, Sons of Earth! success expect When you 'gainst Heaven did your arms direct? Noe mercy, slaves! your Actions that deny. Justice asks vengeance, and you all shall dye. [Hee pursues the savages opposite to a cave where Oroandes is. They all dance round him and sing. Song. 1st Spir. Unhappy Prince! who here must stay, Till our great King is call'd away, And that shall bee before ye sun Six times about ye world has run. Chorus. With Patience then wait till ye clouds rent asunder. There's nothing can wake your sleep but loud thunder [The savages all descend. Phy. What means these fogs? I'me stopt by unseen arms; All things I touch are turned into charms. [Sits down. [Scene III. Ye Pallace.] Enter Juliana and Trivia at severall doors. Jul. Trivia, undone! my father knows I Love. Tri. And won't he, Madam, too your love approve? Jul. Ah, noe! noe cruell father storms more high, Hee is resolv'd ye Princes both shall dye. With mighty charms hee does them fetter'd keep In ye Lethargick Labyrinths of sleep. Six watchfull spirits tend them night and day, That 'tis impossible for to slip away. Tri. Some way, dear Madam, sure may yet bee found. Is there noe spell can force inchanted ground? A woemans wit can ne're bee baffl'd sure. I'le pawn my life; for this I'le find a Cure. Jul. Unjust to them are rigid fortunes frowns. They're now inglorious slaves, who once wore Crowns. This land to my Great Prince does Safety owe And ought more noble guifts on him bestowe. Tri. Ah, Cursed, Madam, bee this Magick art That can trew Lovers keep soe long apart! Jul. But Oroandes yet, if he was free, Would scorn perhaps to bee a slave to mee. His Heart's soe full of glory there's no room For wretched, poor, and forlorn love to come. Tri. If glory bee the mark at which hee aims, Hee'l headlong shoot himself into your chains. What tho his lofty spirit tow'rs soe high, There's something may him please below a scky. Jul. Nothing below an Angell can him move, Nor will hee stoop to ye gay lure of love. Oft have I panted, and have often cry'd, And still as often has hee mee deny'd. Tri. Let him still soar, and still let him mount high, Higher if hee can than th'ambitious boy. 'Tis nothingâ Together all your beauty's forces call And you shall see how's waxen wings will fall. If you too can, I'de have you get him free That hee may thank you for his liberty. Jul. Heavens! I dare not freedome to him give. First in my easy fetters let him live. But oh! if once by mee he was beset, If once hee should bee tangled in my net, Like ye feirce Lyon hee should starve away Before hee would grow tame and mee obey. Tri. Can you then see him such base fetters wear, Loaded with worst of misery's dispair? Jul. Something I'le doe, but nothing can resolve. I'le ask my Brother. Enter Polynice. Poly. Ah, sister, fly. Our Brother's furious grown, Has murther'd half ye People in ye town. A thousand captives have receiv'd their doom This day to bleed at fair Cyane's tomb. Soe far his furious passion has him led That 'gainst ye King hee dares his Army head. Consider then what will bee the event Unless his actions wee by care prevent. Jul. Can Sacred Majesty command noe charm Against ye shocks of a bold Traytours arm? Kings ought ye cheifest care of Heav'n to bee, For they are stamp'd with the same mark as they. Fortune to all ye gods does favour show, But to poor Kings does nought but frowns bestow. If I was King, before I'de wear a Crown Loaded with such cares, I'de leave my throne, Into heav'ns hands restore my right again, All my bright glorys, with the golden chain, And see what god would turn a Tenant for to reign. Poly. 'Tis blood which does these ills from Heaven send And unto us does some strange fate portend. Blood shed unjustly ne're does speechless lye, But still for vengeance does to Heaven cry. Unto our Altars then let us repair And treat ye gods with sacrifice and prayer. [Exit Poly. To Juliana and Trivia, Daemolgoron with his sword drawn. Daem. Young imps of hell! Where's my Cyane gone? Speak then! how could you let her fall alone? The lustfull Tyrant too you should have slain And with his blood have wash'd our honours stain. Jul. Alass! hee was our Father, Sir. Daem. Hee lost that Title wheen hee virtue left. Besides, when Fathers sin, and goe astray, Heav'n wont require you should obedience pay. Ah! could you see her dye, and know I love? How could you soe ingratefull to mee prove? Tri. Ah, indeed it was hard. Jul. Heav'n knows I did withstand her cruell fate, Preach'd virtue to him, till I urg'd his hate. Daem. Barbarous Feind! Jul. But nought would doe. Ye dreadfull bowl hee gave, With blackest poyson sent her to her grave. Tri. Yes indeed, as dead as could bee. Daem. Peace, Beldame hagg! And what did heaven doe? was heaven still? Could heaven see him soe much vertue spill? Jul. Not without mighty signsâ Nothing but Clouds were seen that day she fell; Heav'n in her robes look'd like deformed hell. Daem. Kind Heaven! Jul. Thunder on Tempest's wings flew all around, Streams of bright fire broke from ye ground. The Angry gods did their own Temples shake, The stubborn images themselves did quake. Pale ghosts did rise from ye rent womb of Earth, And from disorder'd fate took second birth. Nature fell sick, and stagerr'd at ye blow. Nothing there was but seem'd to mourn for you. Yet nought could fright him from ye bloody deed, Soe Death's hand seal'd what hee before decreed. Daem. Hold, hold, enoughâ[Kneels. Bright saint, if you my Rivall gods can spare, Descend, and visit once again our air. The only recompense I beg of you, For all my love, I beg, but not as due. Soft Musick is heard above. Ye heavens open. Cyane descends all pale. Four Cupids hang o're her head weeping, crown'd with cypress garlands. Juliana, Trivia run off ye stage, frighted. Daemolgoron stands gazing on her, at last speaks. Am I awake? and are my senses free? That my adored comes again to mee? [The heavens open, and Cyane ascends with soft Musick. How short's ye bliss which wee on Earth receive? 'Tis gon before wee know that it had life. Noe sooner jove hangs down his golden chain But's by some envious god pluck'd back again. Noe one can bee more wretch, and live than I, Born to a crown, and press'd with misery. Cyane still does scorn, and still looks high; Her very ghost has learnt from mee to fly. But oh! it is revenge that she would have, 'Tis that which makes her wander from her grave. Yes, Yes, I will, I will revenge thy Cause, And for thy sake, will break Great Natures laws. Love is ye quarrell which I will maintain, But 'tis noe longer, then, ye throne I gain. [Exit. [Scene IV.] The Scene opens and shows ye 2 Princes chain'd to 2 Rocks, King Zoroastres talking to them. Zor. What News from Persia? will they yet submitt? Own mee their Conquerour? or think they fitt Still in their Arms to live? Oro. Thank mee, ungratefull man! for all you have. I've made you king, and you make mee a slave. How dare you come, and look mee in ye face, After thou hast loaded mee with disgrace? Goeâfetter slaves!â[Shakes his chain. Zor. Set down, thou caged thing! Something above a man, below a King! [Kicks him. Soe Tamerlane, when hee in Triumph rode Mounted on Necks of Kings, hee look'd a God. Phy. Gods! Can you suffer this? look tamely down? Or are you too affraid, when hee does frown? Lend mee your Thunder if you are. I'le spend It all, by Jove, and dart it at that feind. Nor all ye lawrells which from mee you took Shall save you then from my Almighty stroke. Zor. Rage on, Poor Prince! Your Gods don't yet appear. Shake, shake your chain that they at length may hear, But 'tis not fit that they to you should come. To them you then shall goe.âExpect your doom. Oro. O that I could poison thee with my breath! [Turning away. Or kill with Basilisks! I'de give thee death! Int' ev'ry joint thou hast I'de shoot thy fate; All men should pity, but none change thy state. Zor. By Asmenoth! you both shall dye. Appear, My guardian spirits, but first I'le show Such sights shall make you stiff with horror grow. [Spirits arise. Goe, take Cyane's head. Rent her black grave And bring her hither. Bee gone! [Spirits goe out muttering. For know she's dead, and by this hand she fell. (To Phy.) I glory too that I sent her to hell. Hark! how ye doors crack! [A clap of thunder. Here, here she comes. O what a perfect white Is there! Show himânearer. [The spirits hold Cyane's head against Phylanders face. Phy. Enough! Enough! gods take my life away! Why don't you, Tyrant, seize uppon your prey? O! don't that dearest object from mee turn Till I have gaz'd myself into an urn. Zor. Take 'em away. Scourge them with burning whips, Till their souls shrink, and bee noe more! Phylander and Oroandes set down and ye Scaen shuts uppon them. [Scene V. Ye Grove.] Zoroastres solus. Daemolgoron enters with a guard, all their swords drawn, comes upp and speaks to his Father. Daem. Thereâseize the Monster, dragg him to ye Cell. 'Gainst your great charms I'le find a mightier spell. Let Nothing with him but his Conscience dwell. May'st thou with horror, and unpittyed, fall, Who'st been the dreadfull ruin of us all! As much of Beauty as ye gods durst trust On Earth, thou'st basely sacrific'd to lust. Tygers and lions, who noe pity own, To Beauty stoop, and lay all fury down, But you more savage, and more curst than they, Listen'd to your Rage, and devour'd your prey. But knowâI've promised revenge, and will Thy blood, thy soul, unto my fairest spill. Zor. Gods! can I hear this, and from m'only son? Is't thus you pay mee, Sir, for what I've done? Goe, take him henceâlet him too have his chain. [To his spirits. (To Daem.) Your disobedience shall not long remain. Unto my Blackest altar lead ye way; [To his spirits. Take these slaves too. They all shall bleed today. [Pointing to Daemolgoron's guards. I'le riot all ye Gods. Away! As the spirits are a leading Daemolgoron and the guards off, a spirit flys down, and speaks. Spirit. Hold! Thy Power, O King, is now expir'd. I open'd ye Golden Legend and there saw Thy leas'd soul run out, and forfeited. Your spirits I discharge, by a command above. Daem. Â«Say you soe? then I'le turn about.Â» [Aside. Zor. How! Expir'd?â'tis false, it cannot bee. You must and shall bee govern'd still by mee. [The spirits shake their heads. But if I can't, and ye great gods doe call, Heav'n, hell, earth, shall wait uppon my fun'rall. Spirit. Know then that this is ye last Night you'le have. To Morrow's sun will see you in your grave. Zor. By all ye gods, it sha'n't. I will not dye, I all their damn'd malicious power defye. 'Tis not one single Comet that shall light My Fun'rall torch. I'le have all Heaven bright With scorching Fires, and all ye Earth shall shine, And then, when all's dissolv'd, I'leâthink of mine. The spirits all vanish singing: Let us goe, let us goe to ye hollow Tree [Shaking their heads at ye King. And there rejoice, for wee are free, As you, as you shall see. [They vanish. Daem. I wish your Fate may bee recall'd again That you may here amongst us longer reign. Â«For if hee dyes, hee'le then Cyane see [Apart. And who can tell but hee may rivall mee? But oh! may hee see herâÂ» Zor. 'Tis false! My death I know you doe desire, But when I doe, you with mee shall expire. I'le open all thy veins, and you shall dye, By all ye Angry gods, as well as I. Enter Messenger hastily. Mess. Hast, Sir, and see. Your Pallace flames all o're. A Voice was heard i'th'air this hour, this hour. Your mighty statue too is fallen down, And when it fell, 'twas heard to give a groan. The Heavens open'd, and from a rented cloud Legions of spirits flew, Led by their God, Who on ye highest Pinnacle did stand, Pouring in falling Comets with his hand. Daem. O Mighty Prodigys! Zor. Let heaven doe its worst. I can but fall. Thunder, yee Gods! I dare defye you all. Mess. Oh, Sir, repent! Ye Gods may yet forgive. How easy is it for to ask, and live! Zor. Curse on my stars! that gave mee soe short time. Is there noe safety in another clime? Daem. Noe place of safety, Sir, can now bee found. Heav'n has itself beseig'd you all around. Zor. Come then, and lead the way that I must tread. I'le see the gods before they strike mee dead. [The stage darkens. A clap of thunder. I come, I come. [Exit cum Mess. Manet Daemolgoron Daem. Happy's the man who's born below a Crown, And wants those cares, which weigh us Princes down. Give mee an humble Cottage, Shady Cell, Where never yet from Heaven Thunder fell. âBut 'tis too late to wish; that day is gone. The best of life is past, the worst to come. And I must fall t'attend my father to his tombe, For Kings to show that they have liv'd in state Will have attendance even in their fate. But if I can I will prevent it. [Exit. [Scene VI.] The Scene shifts to ye Rocks where ye Princes were chain'd. Their chains drop off, and ye spirits vanish. Phy. Blest bee this day which us from chains has freed, And the Tyrants sudden fate has decreed. Virtue oppress'd still rises at ye last Like the great sun when hee is overcast. Hee gathers all his heat into one globe, Then shoots himself through th'interposing cloud. To you, just Gods! all humble thanks I pay [Kneels. That I doe live to see this happy day. Oro. Come, let us goe, and leave this hatefull place, Where wee soe long have suffer'd our disgrace. Soe may all Tyrants fall, and it is just That they doe perish, who betray their trust. Phy. Blood, and oppression still destroy a Crown, And from just Heav'n, pluck swift vengeance down. [Exeunt. The End of ye 4t h Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT YE V. [Scene I.] The Scene Bactria. Enter Juliana, Polynice, and Governess. Jul. Whoever saw such dreadfull sights as these? Can nought the Angry Deitys appease? Poly. Ah, Noe! their own Great Altars they don't spare, Nor will they hearken to our wretched prayer. The Sibill's now fulfill'd. Wee must expire, And all our world must perish in this fire. Block'd up by fate wee stand, and can't retire. Soe shipwrack'd men, when on ye rocks they stand, With wretched looks they veiw ye distant land, Seeing their fate come rolling all around, And that noe place of harbour can bee found, Curse their ill stars, and with their dropping eyes, Hasten on their fate, which they now despise. Jul. Ill Manner'd Pow'rs! who dare soe soon deface Such stately Fabricks, doe destroy this place, Where your own Father Gods have Reign'd. Poly. Ah! don't let us at ye great gods repine! Nor our last breath with murmurings resign. Who knows but Heav'n at last may pity show? Jul. It comes soe late, I care not for it now. My love is lost. You'le that secured see, And what worth life will then bee left for mee? Poly. I thought such proofs of that I'de giv'n to you That mee again you'd never think untrue. Why should this Jealousy return again? The curse of life, and an eternall pain! Of all ye plagues with which wee now are curst, Jealousey! Jealousey is far ye worst! But oh my Father!

Undone! noe mercy from above! The blood of infants torn from their mothers womb I offer'd uppon ye blackest Altar (Where I never offer'd yet in vain), But now noe relenting god appear'd. For ye soft Musick which came charming down, And ye still voice of the Answering God, Came Thunder, usher'd in with Flashes Which outshin'd ye day, and made ye Morning pale. Such Prodigys aged Time ne're saw Nor History ever left recorded. I had a spirit once would tell mee What ye Gods above design'd to doe. I'le try to raise him. [Hee makes a Circle and goes in ye middle of it. After some muttering ye spirit Ariell descends. Ar. What makes you, holy Father, send for mee? H. P. To Know ye Intention of ye Gods. Ar. Hear thenâ For I am commission'd to tell you all. Your King who once was Heavens Care, Whom I have guarded in greatest danger, Who never ask'd for any thing, but had it,â Nay, such power to him was given That even us hee did equally command,â Grew to that height of Pride, to think himself a god, And dar'd Heaven with all sorts of Crimes, For which hee now must suffer. Nothing can stop it. 'Tis too late to Ask. Therefore submit, and wait ye event. H. P. Will his offspring too bee all destroy'd? Ar. All but ye Youngest shall this night bee slain, Who with Phylander shall for ever Reign. But HarkâI'me called away. [Flys up again. H. P.

Such a night was never yet beheld And universal Ruine sure must follow. Let every King, by this, fair warning take How hee ye Laws of Justice does forsake.

The Guard bring Daemolgoron in, chain'd, and place him by his Father. Severall claps of thunder, and Lightning. Streams of fire cross ye stage. Zor. Soe now I'me ready, and prepar'd for fate, And thank ye gods, that I doe dye in state. Severall Furys and spirits arise, and dance round ye throne, shaking their torches at him, and singing.

Conscience does a witness prove, And you are damn'd for Lust, not Love. Cho. The Gods you doe see are greater than you, And can when they please, a Monark subdue. Song. 1 It is not greatness can defend Nor Longer Life to Mortalls lend; It's Virtue only is ye Freind. 2 The grave, which always rest does give, Rest! which wee cannot have and live, To you denys her common Right, For you'le be dead, and Plagu'd to Night. 3 Hark!

I'me now well satisfy'd with ye Powers Above, Who all our Actions see here below With even hand, and ye just ballance hold To punish vice, and reward vertue. Pardon mee then, o Mighty God of Love! And take this Vultur from my growing heart, That I once more may sweep the dusty Feild And bee my self. To him Trivia with her hair all loose. Tri. Who are you that are now alive And can outlive ye Ruines of your Countrey? Did you not see ye storm, that bloudy storm Which wash'd ye Royall Family away? I think you are ye Prince Oroandes. If you bee, hearken to my wofull story. Juliana was once my Mistress, and once yours, But that is Nothing, for she is noe more. After she'd seen her wretched Father fall, Whom ye gods burnt alive with Flames, And her dear Brother perish by his side, She cry'd, âIt is enough, yee Gods! I come,â And with a more than masculine courage She leap'd into her funerall Pile. But I have done. Adeiw, and must goe forward. [Exit. Oro. This but confirms my former Resolution Of Travelling over all the world Till my tyr'd soul, weary of uneasy life, Withdraws into Natures darkest Room, For Polynice, I'me sure, will ne're mee take, Nor her Phylander will she e're forsake, And Nothing else shall bribe mee for to live. Hence then to Camps, and Bloudy feilds I'le goe, Where Death does Reign, and all Mankind's my Foe. [Exit. [Scene IV.] The Scene changes to a Temple. Enter Phylander, Polynice, and High Preist. Poly. Nay, never Argue that, Most holy Father. The Gods forgot when they left mee here behind. But sure they expected I should Follow: Nature asks this. Phy. Madam, if you to perish are resolv'd, And satiate ye Gods with your diviner bloud, Let mee goe first, And tell 'em you are Coming. But why should Virtue leave the world Again? When you are gone, noe Footstep will remain. Poly. Nay, my dear Prince, for I must call you soe, I'le never stay behind when you doe goe. H. P. Come, come. You both must live, and happy live, For all your Faults, ye Gods, I'me sure, forgive. Poly. My Father, Brother, Sister, all are gone To their eternall, everlasting Home. Oh, that I live to speak it! NoeâLet mee goe, but stay, Phylander, here. I charge you live, and all my crowns to wear. Phy. Without you, Madam, I'le no sceptre take, But all ye glorys willingly forsake. H. P. Stay, glorious pair, I'le ask ye gods. Descend, Bright Ariel, from Above And tell us what ye gods Approve; If they would have those Princes live Or if they will not them forgive. Descend! Descend! After soft musick Ariell descends, clad all in white, and speaks. Ar. Hail, Mighty Princes! Hail, most Happy Pair! The Gods are willing, and delight to spare. Forget what's past, and think of it noe more. Your Royall scepters they again restore, And you, High Preist, by a Command above Are to join those in strictest bonds of love. These Kingdoms then in peace shall still remain And none bee troubled with such wars Again. [Flys up. Phy. Inlarge my soul, ye gods, and make it fit To receive soe vast a gift as this. H. P. Happy's this day. Our troubles now are ended. I'le write it down in leaves of hardest Brass, But keep it Annually for ever. Hail then, Great Princes! I'le goe before And prepare all things for soe great a Ceremony. Poly. Come then, Great Prince; and I thank ye gods They think mee a reward sufficient for your virtue. With Crowns and Scepters willingly I part Since I doe Reign in my Phylanders Heart. Phy. Now I may truly say I happy am, And before deathâ Goe, thou most Holy Father, lead the way, For this shall bee my coronation day. FINIS.</field>
