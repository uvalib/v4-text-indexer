      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âThe New Forest: by a charcoal-fire. Beowulf and Wilfrith. Leofric in the distance. Beowulf. They turn our bread-lands to a pleasant ground. Nature will never bear it: the fierce earth Will rend the foreign, sacrilegious hands As a great mastiff, humble to his lord, Is fatal to the fondling wayfarer. Where now I sit there was a sound of bells, The sight of curling smoke from cotters' roofs; I feel the undergrowth above my chin Where there was browsing common. All the wood Is savage, rank, o'ergrown, pestiferous, Depopulate of man, and teeming with The rampant, wild, unprofitable beasts That forage on him. Ah, there is a sound, A merry, merry horn, a laughing cry; Let's wait. Wilfrith. Grandfather, you should trust in God. Beowulf. It's the earth I'm trusting to, I've planted it; It feels the tie of blood down to the pith; It will not fail. Wilfrith. But Bishop Wulstan says That we should love our neighbours. Beowulf. So I do; I love them so, I'd sniff about their graves If they were here. How can we love the dead That drop forgotten, and just rot in soul And body, cut away from burial And peace-endowing prayer? We must avenge. Wilfrith. We are so helpless. Beowulf. You have eyes and youth. Age in despair is weaker than a child; Its weather-beaten hope is mightier Than any fitful ferment of the blood. From the first moment of the rimless dark In which I wake, slumber, and feel the sun, A hope struck root, I felt it in the soil Of my blocked brain, where thought went burrowingâ A tedious moleâand sense writhed underground. The fibres of this hope took hold of me, Pierced, ramified my subterranean life; Now it has heaved out to the upper light And spreads I know not whither.âI am blind. Wilfrith [aside]. He frightens me: it's like one in the grave Who can lie quiet till the judgment-day, Brooding his wrongs. [Aloud.] But must we not forgive? The Conqueror Left our king Harold's body on the beach In his great battle-fury. Afterward He buried it at Waltham, penitent. Beowulf. We must submit, be penitent, forgive!â But that's to change your mind; I never thought That God changed His.âI thought within myself The seasons were not surer than the Lord, You might depend on Him. It's altered now; He's God of Battle Abbey; ... on the beach He let them huddle up King Harold's bones, He's strewn our prayers as ashes to the wind, Suffered such resurrection of men's bones As modest Death cries shame of.âHe repents, His past is not prophetic of to-day; But at the breaking-places of the wave All keepeth constant to its habitude; There is no change of custom in the air; Yon oak drops acorns; I am comforted. The earth is English still; the soil gives suck; It will not rear strange children. What's that noise? I hear a whistling and the splint of wood. Art sharpening arrows? Leofric. Why, they have an aim. I'm carving, grand-dad, could you only see;â Here is that leering abbess to the life. Oh, I'll shoot from the gargoyles and not miss. I'm moulding such a lot of funny curves About the mouthânot wrinklesâit's more soft. ... The change is gradual as youth to age. Look, Wilfrith! ... here's a soul forgets itself, Popping an eager face from out the cowl, A blaze of curiosity. Can guess? Wilfrith. Not Uncle Godric. It's the curious dean That frighted Twynham's canons ere his rule, And longed to build. Why should you mimic him? He gave you learning. Leofric. Bless your mother-wit! Mock him, you numbskull! 'Tis the very life. It's clear that he got thwarted yesterday By the drawn brows: clear too he'll overcome, By this huge, dominant, aggressive chin. I've caught the very moulding of his smile; Smiles have so many shapes. Beowulf. Where's Harold, lads? Leofric [aside]. Ah me, it's bitter seeing with the voice. The half-blank, blundering visage overgrown With sorrow, all the faculties shrunk down To pollard, and a fevered ignorance Writhing the sightless gaze. If I might notch Those wrinklesâ [Carves. Wilfrith [to Beowulf]. Harold will be here anon, Dear grandfather. [To Leofric.] You have no shame at all To hew a blind man's face from out that block.â [Enter Harold, followed by Purkis.] He's here, and looking sullen. Who's behind? Why, father! Purkis. By your looks you have not seen What's lying underneath the splintered fir. Now, grand-dad, clap a great fist to your ear And take the news. ... A Norman 's dead, I found him lying stiff down in the glade; And it's a prince, his cloak all broidered o'er Thick as the May-buds, and that blasted red Streaking his golden hair. Leofric. Where does he lie? Purkis. Up higher half a mile. Don't start, ye fools; No meddling with him. One might feel him o'er As if he were a dog; when we are dead We are all peasants, churl and prince alike, Except they carry us to Winchester. And yet I dare not touch him for my eyes. [Old dad, they gouged yours out; I had to keep You grumbling through a night of twenty year.] We must not smell about a fallen stag; Just let him wither like an autumn leaf. I think he died by nature, sort of struck. [To Beowulf.] Ay, chuckle, grand-dad, there's an eye in Heaven Peering at loophole, though our chinks be bunged. [To himself.] He finds a sort of comfort in it like, To feel there's some one scanning; for my part This staring at misfortune in the way It pleases Providence to practise,âwell, It's like the cattle; they'll stare by the hourâ They never move: the watching simply galls, If there's no heave of rescue in the eye. But all the same I'm pleased this happens pat To cheer the old man up. [Aloud.] A pretty lad, We think it's young Prince Richard. Harold. Half a child, And, curse him, such an innocent young face,â Out ravaging; he could not understand. Wilfrith. Should we not bury him? Beowulf. Are there no beasts To feed on him, no rain, nor loosening wind To help him to mortality? Forbear! We may not touch the quarry. Leofric. I must go See him myself. Purkis. You have a cunning eye That copies like smooth water; go your ways, It's early yet; but come back stealthily. [Exit Leofric. [To Harold.] Harold, you're in the sulks. Harold. He looked so helpless and so innocent I could not hate him. Could we rise in hordes And storm their castles; but to cut one offâ Beowulf. Is it the work of any native hand? Harold. No; there are hundreds who would gladly do 't For lack of something nobler. Purkis. Bide your time. Come, you are gossiping like wenches; work. I soon shall have to keep you, dad, and all. Three sturdy lads, these faggots still to stack, And that old waster trunk to hew away. Come, Harold! I find Wilfrith on his knees, Praying our Lady with his tools before; And Leofric gets out a curious knife And peels the bark;ânot one can deal a blow. Harold. Firewood to warm mere slaves, to be put out At curfew-bidding. Oh the weariness! There is no choice 'twixt murder and the tools; No soldier's part, no fearless happy death, No hope of honourable home and love. I have seen trees cut down for building ships, The bonnie waving branches overhead Straightened to twigless timber. Father, if I could so perish for the land's defence, All wantonness of youth I'd put away, All sap of pleasure, all sky-peering pride, To be a seasoned keel, an implement, A common plank for Freedom's foot to tread; I will not see my manhood's goodly powers Rated with monkish imbecility. Wilfrith may saw the wood and say his prayers, I'll do some mischief, and so earn my death. [Exit. Purkis [looking after him]. The devil, ah! Ne'er misdirected to a gallows. If The boy will turn from wholesome work and prayer And live on curses, I shall find him caught Like Absalom up yonder in the bough. My son, my son!âI laugh when my heart aches; Like stretching out a weary stiffened leg, The change of posture brings a little ease. Wilfrith. Father, hear! Let me set out for Twynham, tell the tale Of the young prince's death; these holy men Will bring a litter, bear the corpse away, And no suspicion. Purkis. Make an end of it, A decent end; I do not grudge the child Some pretty burial chaunting and a mass. Keep God in thought; He's haply hereabout. Grand-dad, I'll leave you by the charcoal-fire To watch; there's nothing else that you can do. Beowulf. Nothing at all; I'm best here by the fire Hid in the turf, the oven where the wood Is packed, and all is changed by patience. There's nothing else to do. Purkis [looking back at his father]. Sometimes he'll sit Seven days and nights in the thick oozing smoke, Noiseless as clay, and on his countenance A fiery revolution. Nothing comes Peaceful across; his passions harry him, And from their ravaged homestead in his eyes Flee to make murderous havoc on the brow. He'll not recover; like the Yorkshire wolds He's scarred effectually,âno hope of corn On the once pleasant uplands of his face. All's bleak and desert. ... Poor old rambling dad, They think he is a prophet! [Exit. Scene II. âTwynham. Christchurch. The Priory Court. Enter Godric, Canons, and Wilfrith. Godric. Alas, Prince Richard lies beneath the trees, His May o'erlaid with death's untimely snow. Much will Duke Robert mourn his lusty son,â The second Richard whom the hunt hath slain. So learn we how sin works the vengeance That's properly its curse. A father spread A net of tangled boughs to hold the deer He loved as they were children of his bone; Therein his royal issue is entoiled, Slain with the arbalest. Woe dogs the pride That took the people's earth in lust of sport, And banished God from the deep forest-glades. 1st Canon. An awful deed to burn each holy church! 2nd Canon. But shall this child receive no sepulchre Because his fathers sinned? Godric [to Canons]. Go, get a bier, And Wilfrith shall be guide to where he lies. He took not up with conscious blasphemy His race's wickedness. To Winchester He shall be gently borne. [Exeunt Canons.] Wilfrith, your heart Hath some petition. Speak it openly. Wilfrith. I found you fishing in the shallow streams That spread a purity about these meads, And glass the sky which you have vowed to serve. Your lips were moving happily: methought You lay in shelter of a lovely peace I sigh to enter. Here the weight of life Is taken from the shoulders of the world.â Oh, might I join your dedicated band, And share their simple days 'mid lowly scenes Beyond the forest's hateful witchery. Godric. My son, your heart hath heard the heavenly call; Be patient. You are bidden and will come Soon as the time is ripe. Wilfrith. I'd live and die At this sweet place, in your sweet company. Godric. In God's good time! [Re-enter Canons.] There come the brothers back. 1st Canon. All is prepared. Godric [to Canons]. Go, four of you, to lift With song and supplication the fair prince To mistimed funeral. My blessing! Wilfrith. Give To me peculiar benison. I go To living death in yon accursed bounds. Godric. Hope and religion purify your heart, And keep it ready! Benedicite. [Exeunt. I'll work that he may join our humble Church. But who comes here? [Enter more Canons.] 3rd Canon. O father! woe is me! That man of wrath, that spoiler of the Church, That dark blasphemer with the fiery name, Flambard, is at our gates. Godric. Now Heaven help! He means the house no good. [Enter other Canons.] 4th Canon. Alas, sweet Dean! He enters with a proud and dancing eye, That inventories all it looks upon, And smirches all it sees. 5th Canon. Each door and chink Draws his observance, and he marks each man As he would buy him into slavery. His mouth commands as doth a trumpet-blare, By clamour brazen-voiced; his ruddy face Burns like a beacon prophesying strife; His stubborn form is irresistible; The weak air flies before it. ... 4th Canon. A low churl, A hag-begotten priest. 5th Canon. We'll never bow And cringe beneath his trampling insolence. 4th Canon. Never! Godric. God give me strength and soldiership! 4th Canon. Listen! His voice along the corridor Crashes the covered silence. Flambard [within]. Where's this dean, This Godric? [Enters with other Canons.] Godric. Here. Flambard. I come to claim my own. Godric. Then no man who is just may hinder you. Flambard. Sense in a churchman! Wonderful! The king Hath granted me the church and convent. 5th Canon. Lord! Flambard. Ay, so I am thy lord, thou tonsured fool. The church is mine; the priory too is mine, And mine, ye shivering souls, the revenue. 'Tis all at my disposal, and I will To build me a new church of richer stones, And ampler stretch from sacred East to West, With higher roof and more exalted tow'r. Godric. I'll tell you of the building of this church.â In ancient days upon St. Cath'rine's hill The workmen laid foundations; every night Beneath the moon a thunder moved the air; The stones were scattered, and then lost to sight: But soon as morning trod with silver feet Upon the shining pavement of the streams Meadowy Stour and Avon, on a strip Of land, a cape of river-lavÃ¨d earth, The builders found their blocks. So every night The new foundation on the lofty hill Was carried by still influence away To the low bed of waters. The command, Thus clearly issued, was at last obeyed; The builders plied their craft; but every day A Stranger came and bore the heavy hours. He never broke the necessary crust, Nor stayed for payment when the sun went down, And on the day of consecration none Could see Him near nor far.âThey named the church Christ Church. ... You'd give His finished work to men, Throw down the walls He spent Himself to build, Whose corner stones He laid? Flambard. Our modern tastes Judge such a hole unworthy as the home Of the angelic King. Godric. Ye judge for Him Who gave His judgmentâfools! Flambard. Chain up thy tongue, Old man; its surly bark Must back to kennel. Godric. The unhallowed witch Who bore thee to the devil, trained thy tongue Thus to detraction and malignity. Flambard. Beware, vile Saxon! If I catch that laugh Sneaking about the corners of your face, I'll fire it like a fox from every hole Of eye and mouth. Sir Dean, you shall not eat My bread till you are humbler. Godric. Never fear! Your meat I will not taste. 1st Canon. Alas, he raves; We cannot face the desert. 2nd Canon. We must yield With sad submission. Flambard. Will ye? All. Yes, alas! Flambard. Then certain moneys shall ye put apart To keep you, and all fasts shall be observed. The rest of your good treasure I shall hold For sake of the new church that I shall build To cover you with beauty. Well, Sir Dean, Will you not rule the dinner I provide For modest stomachs? Godric. No, I'll never touch Hell-offered bounty: rather will I go To yon wide shades, where corn and apple-tree Are exiles, and the beasts have treasured limbs 'Tis death to roast. Flambard. The king would blast your sight For such a speech! You, canons, I forbid To seek to turn him from his foolishness. My wrath will burst its sides if longer kept In fume. We'll drink. Draw forth your choicest wines And parchments of the priory, the key Of every store and coffer. While I feed I'll cast the sums up. Then I'll say adieu, And pass the gates, and shut them, dean, on you. [Exeunt. Scene III. âMalwood Lodge, in the New Forest. Enter Walter Tirel, William of Breteuil, and Robert Fitzhamon. Tirel. 'Tis strange he loves the forest with a lust The green leaves wake to madness; yet its shade Hath been a brother's hearse, a nephew's doom: Fate spins beneath its beeches. Breteuil. True, the king Pants with ungoverned joy within its ways. He loves to scent the honeyed, sylvan air, To break the greenwood holly with a cry That peals above the comely-headed trees, And pierces the remote and quiet deer Before the dart is through them. Fitz-hamon. 'Tis a weald For royal pleasure. Tirel. Doubtless; yet methinks About the silver trunks and mossied paths There is a noiseless awe, an influence That passes to the heart and sits within Unasked, unwelcome, irremovable. Fitz-hamon. Our Tirel is besprited in the glades. 'Tis said they swarm with magic shapes and sounds That make the Saxon chatter with dismay And superstition. Tirel. Well, our Norman woods Are sunnier and sparser and more soft In entertainment to the traveller Than this gigantic forest. I am strange To such dense multitude of vaulted boughs As keep the healthy sun from entering. Breteuil. We hunt to-day. To-morrow we take horse For distant Gloucester where the Council meets. God grant we get a primate; for the king Still holds the sainted visitor from Bec, Sweet-featured Anselm, prisoned in the land, And will not let him sail. Tirel. 'Tis strange, most strange; The king is unmoved in his blasphemy And pride against the Church, and yet he keeps Its brightest jewel by him. Fitz-hamon. Hark! the horn, The press of dogs, the steed's uneasy pace, The burly prickers and the merry knaves! [They enter singing.] Song. To the forest, ho! Where the tall deer run, We'll go, we'll go, And every one Shall bend his duteous bow. To the forest, heigh! Where the green oaks stand, We'll ride away, A jolly band, With, ho! for a greenwood day! [Enter the King with boisterous following.] Rufus. Here I breathe free; here am I over-lord Of man and wold; here the subservient soil I privilege, or starve to barrenness, As my caprice resolves. I punish here. Ha, ha! Here am I absolute. I roar A lion through the woods, and fugitive Slinks the unmanÃ¨d and offenceless herd; Or scans me with a trembling constancy, Too much appalled for flight. My will is law, Fair Forest-Law,âthat is my perfect will. It dooms the poacher to the swinging bough, The hound to cringing service, and the deer To the large liberty of wide confine. I'm generous here to my brute prisoners, Yielding them charters with a liberal hand,â License to lord it on this noble vert At the king's pleasureâthe condition.âAh! The Church herself must hold her revenues As ebbs and flows my treasury's yellow tide. I am the source of all munificence. When I confer a primate on my realm The halo will be beaming on his brow, And he in saintliness excel as far As I in sovereign empire. [The King's horse is led in. Noble roan! This master-stirrup, fitted to my foot, Confirms my pre-appointment to excess In natural dominion. I am stout In body and gigantic in desire Of sport; the meagre meshes of this wood Chafe me; its dwarfish pleasures mock my pride. I will afforest more; there shall be dark Through flawless umbrage of serene arcades From dawn to sunset, ere my hunter's lust Confess satiety. Mount, gentlemen! [Exeunt. Scene IV. âThe Forest. Leofric carving a piece of wood. Wilfrith digging. Leofric. A horn! Methinks the forest hath another use These precious hours of morning, when the world Is at some process of its perfecting 'Twere well to learn the trick of. Wilfrith toils, Tearing yon fibre from the ground a-sweat With effort; while for me!âmy eyes are full; I have no want; the world is excellent; There is no prickle in the holly wrong. How bossily it clusters! Fool to try Reckon its notches;âa few sturdy twists With strength of mid-rib chronicles the typeâ The burly spread of the wall-building tree, Its bristling leaves compact, well to the fore; Behind, the rampart's azure secrecy. Well, Wilfrith, are you satisfied? Wilfrith. If now I might go in hot from my work and pray. O brother, tell my father of my need. I'm bidden to the cloister. What is wrong Is in our souls; we suffer for our sins, And must afflict ourselves. Leofric. Oh, do not think We travel so untreasured in resource We needs must earn the bread of every joy By sweat of soul. If life 's a desertâah! There's manna in the waste; it lies about, And the wise idle soul is satisfied.â What is 't? An adder curled upon the bough? You stare and shake. [A spectre passes. Wilfrith. Brother, you saw it pass ... ? A mist with bony outlines ... and an eye Cross'd by a bloody streak. Leofric. Such often glide About the coloured stems or twist around The blank tree-shapes of midnight. Wilfrith. Oh, we live Within accursÃ¨d bounds; the insolence Of pleasure hath unsanctified the Church, Unbuilt the home, ungirdled field from field, And made this tract an uncouth wilderness Where demons jeer and sooty spectres hunt With flamy-visaged hounds. I must escape; The very air is sinful. Leofric. In God's time I'll range the dirty faces of these ghosts About His tow'r, that men may see their foes And know them. So I'll turn to righteousness What poisons you. There's one that's half a cat, With human eyes and howling fringe of teeth About its monstrous yawn; one, rough and plump As knarl upon an oak, is animate With jollity; one hangs his fiendish jaw Demure and lustful; one through chink of lid Gloats on the holy sky. I've learnt them all, And men shall see them in eternal stone, And fear and watch.âHere wend no sprites of Hell, Our uncle and our father. [Enter Purkis and Godric.] Wilfrith. Grave and slow. Godric. My sons, my sons, the very Church herself Gives but uncertain shelter. I am cast Forth from my house of Twynham, sent to find A strange asylum for my agÃ¨d grief. Wilfrith. Never! Godric. Alas! 'tis wicked Flambard's will, That torch of God that brands on us our sins With flaming judgment. Wilfrith. How my heart is sore! There was sure healing in the holy place You kept in righteousness across the bounds Of this sin-blighted purlieu. Godric. Comfort lies A placid child on every sorrow's breast; It wakes to laugh us into hope again. All will be well with me. I have no fear. The homeless in their land are ever watched By ministers of Grace. Take heart, my son. At my entreaty, as my parting charge, The new dean will receive you to the peace And blessedness of holy brotherhood. Purkis. Ay, Wilfrith, never quake and hang your head. For shame! Become the monk, lad, like a man. Wilfrith. I am unworthy. ... Purkis. Pooh, it was thy wish. There's no brave muscle in that puny thought That makes a man unworthy of his aim. Wilfrith. I cannot speak: good uncle, come to me;â The ruined chapelâthere I will give thanks. [Exit. Godric. They think my church is mean; they have proud souls That will not stoop in pray'r nor rise in chant Save under mighty column and jagged arch. Leofric. The church to be re-built? Godric. And you are named To work its stones to shape of beast and plant, To twist the column, to endue the wall With dragon's flinty scales. Leofric. I will transplant The forest and its phantoms to the church. I'll make our ivy's locked and solid stems Grip and o'erspread the pillar. [Enter Harold and Beowulf from another part of the forest.] Purkis. Grand-dad comes, Half-fog, half-thundercloud his poor blurred face. Why, Harold, you are hot. Harold. There's feast to-day At Minstead; the good buck that Malf may carve Once in the year is served. Heav'n choke the churl! Purkis. He ever loved good dishes. Have you heard Flambard is lord of Twynham? Leofric. And the church To be re-built. Godric. The canons dispossessed Of the revenue. Beowulf. There they christened meâ In the old church of Twynham. It's washed out. Harold. Grandfather, do not mind your christening. Edwin and Aldric both are dead For shooting at a stag, like Malf, who now Is chewing at his savoury haunch unhurt. I loved them. Oh, the sweet, big, comely boys! Such giants they were growing. Godric. Let us go And learn if we may bury them. Purkis. Kind soul! [Exeunt Godric, Purkis, and Leofric. Beowulf. The air has been a-milking; it smells sweet As a lass fresh from the udders. The young trees Shoot up; the king grows over-fond of it, The fatal mazy place, Prince Richard's grave. Ay, there's a noise of tears. What, Harold, lad! [Feeling him.] His sturdy hair. Harold. I'll take to woman's work. To be a man has no significance. Beowulf. Eh! But there's change of weather in your voice. Who suffers? Are they mutilated? Harold. What! You have been deaf and imbecile? You're dull. I've heard you eloquent. Beowulf. These troubles, lad, Are over-pressing me; I'm like an old O'erladen cart that cracks beneath the sheaves. They put too much upon me. In the wood, Under the oak-boughs they are hanging them? Harold. Oh, you have mighty memories to climb; Away in the great passes you are safe. There's no remembrance in my youth's routine, No sweet denial for fair freedom's sake, No passion-hoarding for the prodigal Spendthrift fulfilment of a great desire; No fine asperities of hope, no thrill, Awe, and exhilaration of a joy That toils a-hung'ring towards its blessedness. You cannot know the pang, the helpless love For my own England that has cast me off, That will not have me live or die for her. What is one's country? The sole woman-child, Rosy and prattling daughter of a Past Too winnowed in experience, too grave For blood's desire to mix with reverence; While she, in tender prime, no grace of youth Awanting to her, ravishes the heart, And teaches wisdom in the ecstasy Of nuptial consummation. Oh, to breathe The name that she hath taught with her own lips, To know it is the Norman's heritage, To know that she herself will change! Before She plays the harlot, I will seal my soul From agony; the beasts in spotted heaps I'll slay, and cast their corpses o'er the fence Of Malf, the Saxon guardian of the deer. I'll rot before his eyes, hung on the oak That branches toward his door. I'll spoil the edge Of his slave's appetite. Minstead no more Shall cook and eat its mess of felon's meat; There shall be some recoil. [Breaks through the boughs. Beowulf. He'll put it down, This fattening on the people's provender. There's nothing done except at cost of life. My lad ... His voice rang free, a bird upon the wing, The lark's victorious pinion in the trill Of his young note. The linnets on the twig Jar me with insect twitter. By-and-by I'll sit beside the gallows; I've the time. [Exit. Scene V. âGloucester. A Room. Enter Bishops Gundulf, Walkelin, and others; Robert Fitz-hamon, Robert of Meulan, and other Nobles. Gundulf [showing a petition]. From holy Anselm comes this blessÃ¨d leaf Of healing and assuagement to the land Fevered with ulcerous sore. Pray Heav'n this balm Soften the rancour of the royal heart. Fitz-hamon. I fear me it will irritate: the king Hath heard on th' instant that by traitors' hands His Ralf is put to sea. The storm on 's face I fled from: there was lightning in its clouds, And they were ranked for vengeance. Walkelin. He hath heard Of this petition, and will doubtless sign. He blesses even now in secrecy The tranquil abbot hither journeying. Believe me. ... [Enter the King.] Rufus. Where is Ralf? The rumour goes He is arrested and borne over sea. Now listen, gentlemen, by Lucca's face, I'll throw that torch still hissing from the wave, A brand shall set your bishoprics in flames. My churls!âit shall be worse for them; I'll throw A rope across the land,âwhether it yield Or not, it shall be taxed. I'll make myself The heir of every benefice,âthe monks Shall starveâtheâ Fitz-hamon. We, my lord, are ignorant Of any misadventure. Gundulf. But, if Heav'n Deign to chastise a base misgovernor, Beseech your Majesty in holy fear Receive the dreadful warning and repent. Walkelin. My liege, there is another raging sea Waits to engulf us allâthe people's hate. This See of Canterbury ... Rufus. Ha, ha, ha! You jest, Sir Bishop. I will walk this sea In royal progress. Gundulf. Stay that reckless tongue, Ere for its sin a sudden leprosy Snow-like envelop your affrightÃ¨d soul. Fitz-hamon. Here comes a messenger! [Enter a Messenger.] Rufus. With dripping clothes. A mariner. How now! From the whale's belly hast extracted him, The mighty woe-pronouncer on you all, My pious lords? Messenger. Sir Ranulf greets his liege, Bids me reportâfrom great calamity Being delivered, to the castle gates He journeys swiftly. Rufus. Give him welcome, lords! Escort him to the presence. Bishops, go! [Exeunt some of the Bishops and Lords. Ha, ha! They shall receive their ravisher As the chief nurse and pastor of the flock. He's chuckling with them now. Gundulf [aside]. Heav'n save the king From a deservÃ¨d chastisement. Fitz-hamon. He hath Some ground for his displeasure. Rufus [ascending his throne]. To my throne! Place for the chancellor beside. Make way. [Enter Flambard and Bishops.] What! back again, My peerless chancellor, my jovial Ralf! My sometime kitchen-clerk, my jolly priest, Most scrupulous financier, and lord Over God's heritageâthe virtuous way Of estimating to an ounce the fleece, The silky-hided revenues that 'long To my fierce crosier-bearing royalties. Art wet, storm-frosted, naked and despoiled? The murderers! Had they extinguish'd you, My fire-brand to the foxes, my gay flame, My tâtâtâorâch, myâ Flambard. Stop that stuttering, my liege. 'Twas I outwitted them. To see the fools, When they had made me captive, fail to fix How to despatch me;âshould they drown or slay? I recommended that the prisoner Should, by compression of the thumb to throat, A bloodless corpse, resign his rich attire Unsullied to his captures. They laughed, Fell to the survey, and grew quarrelsome, While friendly winds rose higher. In the gale My seamanship [is there, my liege, a craft Of which I am not master?] awed the men, Coupled with just a sly, malicious, half- Retaliating, pious hint of how They were delivered to my hand, and must Cry mercy! would I pray them into port. At landing, I had pow'r to pack them all In prison for the hangman's courtesies; But plucked them by the beard and bade them drink Health to my body and their damning souls. So blessed them and departed. What's the news? Rufus. Why, Ralf, a pray'r, a loyal loving pray'râ Ha, ha!âthat I should strictly give command The people shall entreat the Lord to change My heart. ... Sweet Ralf, here is my signature With laughter's palsy somewhat tremulous. [Signs the paper. Conceive it! ho! a thousand muffled mouths To change this heart and force me cast you off. I warrant they would sweat at it. Ho, ho! Flambard. Good jest, i' faith! Rufus. And since ye now have warrant for your knees, Committing you to fasting's penury, And much hard labour of the lips, I pray Begone! [Waving his hand. While I await the issues of this war, This sally, this celestial enterprise. Like a good tow'r I stand, resistant, firm; Seek ye to undermine me with your pray'rs, Who bootless batter my thick-wallÃ¨d will. Ay, but I swear, by my own mother's soul, Tho' you should summon the great Overlord, To quadruple your forces in this siege, You will not ... Flambard. Leave them threatless to their pray'rs. Beseech you give me an hour's audience; Embrace me as your new-restorÃ¨d heir. Let us make merry. Rufus [to Attendants]. Pack the churchmen off! And you, my lords, the council is at end. [Exeunt Bishops. Some two hours later and we meet at hunt. My Ralf, your king himself shall slay the deer That with full, feastful Norman courtesy Confirms your welcome at our board to-night; The rich and savoury meat of your return. Meanwhile I feed on gluttonous. [To Lords.] Retire! [Exeunt Lords. What knitting still your handsome brows? Uncrease! Let us to laughter. Flambard. They betake themselves To pray'rs, the beldam's refuge. Nought to fear; We may retain the See of Canterb'ry. I have no further scrupleâthat isâdread. We may to work. Rufus. My pretty Publican, Too rigorous in sooth you rate the dues And issues of this action to enjoy Its perfect rustic innocence. Conceive This heart, this prodigal, rapacious heart, This wine-warmed bosom, this gold-hardened breast, This bubbling fount of life that feeds and fills Must be dried up to dribble of the monk! Let's cut our ruddy curls and grow austere As pious Lanfranc, for whose soul I pray, Being so affluent in his revenues. My rosy Ralf, let us resemble him, And love these hinds and give them liberties, And pray that we may think upon the Church, And lay our jewels 'mid be-sainted bones. Oh, let us pray that this may come to pass, And show our humbled faith in miracle. They have permission; let them pray their best, While I perform my worst.âWhat didst thou say Of this vile Purkis and his more offence Against our forest-laws and honest Malf, The guardian of our deer? Flambard. He slaughters them. You know there is a custom that the lord Of Minstead claims with every summer's sun A stately buck or doe at Llammas-tide, Provided only that, if either fall Within the forest-bound, he leave a haunch To show the antler'd beast's true overlord. This Purkis, chafing one of Saxon blood Should servile eat our royal venison, Heap'd Minstead-tracks with gory haunch and head, And, breaking all restraint, defiantly Dared Malf to meddle with his sport. Rufus. A dog To be unclaw'd! Hot-irons! Torture, man! Don't trust to the ordeal. God's no judge Of forest-laws; He never followed deer. A cord about his throat! Within my bounds, My bâbâbâouândâs! Flambard. My lord, you grow too sudden red. Chafe not so angrily.âHe's in a fit. [Beckons and whispers to a Servant Name but a forest-treason to this House It foams i' the mouth half-lunatic. How now? A rope shall perch the medd'ling clown tree-high From further mischief. Rufus. Itâit drives me mad. I will have every inch of earth;âthe half My realm in hands of priests, and my fair woods, My noble deer! ... I will be absolute While there is any breath Left in my body: no competitor Shall rival me. King William shall be sole ArchbishopâAnselm they are praying forâ Curâcurâse him!âof Canterbury. Flambard. Tut, my liege, We'll bleed you of these humours. You're perverse. [Enter John de Villula.] Good my lord bishop, help me raise the king; He's stiff and speechless. De Villula. Short, too, i' the neck! These sudden cholers ... with profanity. ... Heav'n looks not kindly on the arrogant. A little water. Ay, ay! he revives; The Lord looks on his people. ... This is sent Doubtless in mercy to admonish him. [Exeunt, bearing Rufus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âDusk: a windy cleared place. Harold's body bleaching on a gallows: near it Beowulf. Beowulf. I feel it's here; I have no need to see. I'm glad they murdered him, not made him dark; For now he's dead the Earth will think on him As she unweaves his body bit by bit. She'll have time like the women-folk at work To turn all over in her mind, and get His wrongs by heart. He never trusted her; He thought her slow ... she's old, It's true; and no ambition for herself: When the corpse lies where she has given suck The lusty days stir in her. [Enter Wilfrith.] Who is here? Wilfrith. Wilfrith! I often come to pray for him; I loved him; it's like standing by the cross, The thief'sâand he my brother! As a child He pushed me from him; I was timorous. I have more reason now to be afraidâ He died impenitent. [Aloud.] O grandfather, Let us go home; we can pray better there! Beowulf. Pray! pray! Are you a wench to chatter so? Does not your tongue grow rigid in your head, A corpse to bear that silence company? Have you no death in you? Oh, say your prayers; I will keep mourning in my ruined ears The passing of his voice. Wilfrith. But, father, think! We're praying for his soul, that it may rest. Beowulf. Is it a monk? Do we all take to cells In our walled coffins? Wilfrith. Rumour's in the air King Harold lingers still a penitent At Chester, wailing sore his people's pride, Whose uncurbed spirit still refuses peace With William, the true heritor. Beowulf. How like This sounds to the king's voiceâin woman's clothes! Trickle your puny lies. Wilfrith. It may be true. They say he frees us from our loyalty; And bids us tend the land in quietness, Yielding the Church her dues. Beowulf. The land, O God, The soil! ... The people's common earth They trench and furrow for their sustenance, Let fall their sweat in, put away their dead For the cool dark of ... [Enter Purkis.] But I hear a step.â I'll have your lying words put to the sword. Purkis. Why, grand-dad, whew! find you in company Of our young priest to keep the devils off My poor lad's corse? [Aside.] He'd better keep the crows. Oh, it's insufferable the way he snuffs This carrion. I'm his father; I have eyes. Harold, my boy, we're hidden in the womb When we're a-making. Faugh, these processes Infamous in exposure! [Aloud.] Come away, And if I catch you sneaking hereâ Beowulf. You'll swear King Harold lies at Waltham. Purkis [aside]. He's confused Betwixt the great King Harold and my son. He's growing childish with his long confine I' the constant dark; new trouble 'mazes him. [Aloud.] Come off, I can't stay here; there's pestilence. Wilfrith [in an undertone]. Speak to him, father; he can't see it right, And if I argue, he's so terrible, My mind is laid like corn; we shall be lost If thus we break the fences of the law, And harm the unoffending gentlefolk. The sight of him [pointing to Beowulf, who walks apart] unsettles all our youth. We lost our Harold through his vengefulness; He cuts our lads off faster than the king Fulfils his dreadful threats; we're perishing, The Normans gaining ground. Purkis. Oh, never fear, We will be masters; there's the stuff in us; We're used to the pace of Nature and keep step; Our habits are not conquered; like the fowls We flap our wings at eventide and roost; Breed, too, uncommon fast. We'll grow anon A forest of stout youngsters for the old Plantations they have put the hatchet to; And force the king protect them tenderly As the pleasure-trees now filling into wood. He will not have a choice. Wilfrith [pointing to Beowulf]. His sinful soul! Purkis. He's damning daily as men reap the corn By armfuls, if a monk should measure him. Heaven clothes itself in our infirmities; And I, who am his son, make bold to hope That God will take upon Himself those eyes [Turning to Beowulf. To look upon his faults;âHe's merciful. But hold you off awhile; he's mumbling now; His tottering lips are haply setting out In age for holy land. Beowulf [aside]. I breathe the air; The tongues of free men should inhabit it; It is infested by the shackled speech Of base petitioners. Wilfrith [to Purkis]. But, Harold, think! He died without God's body; all our lives We must say masses for him fearfully. There is a King in heaven we must serve, Or die as traitors. Beowulf. Is God called a King? I'll never, never trust Him. Purkis [to Wilfrith]. Tut, my lad, You're over-anxious; as I take it now, Our souls were never private property A man might call his own;âI rather hold Our duty's simply a stupendous fief Our Overlord lets out to us in bits To plod at peaceful, putting armour on When His old quarrel with the devil needs Sword-settling; but the more part of our days It's produce He requires, not skirmishing. These sins of ours Let's put 'em in as muck about our roots, Not fling to waste. Those early Norman years I had a murderous heart; I plucked it out, Flung to the refuse; now it's rotted down To just a sturdy holding to my rights. If you will put away your baser parts, You'll grow a slender crop. Feed full the field If you desire the hundred-fold increase, I say ... but you, religious, cannot learn The right use of your sins. It's wasting breath To speak to you. [Exit Wilfrith.] [Looking at Beowulf.] Can't say it's growing dark; [Aloud.] Why stars are all a-throbbing overhead; Now we may sleep, and safe: Heaven's sentinel. Beowulf. Send off the youngster to his rushes. Hark! It has been pouring on my brain; they found A corpse, a counterfeit; they buried it I' the Norman Minster: he is on the beach Where the waves join in battle; in the cairn Of England's stones the treasure of his heart. The winds blow over him; he hears them pass Fresh from this gibbet, and the mound's aheave ... He's under the great Standard! ... Purkis [aside]. Prophecy Is just a leak o' the spirit, drains the head O' the angry, bubbling waters that would lash The afflicted lunatic: he's merry now For come two hours,âa-chuckling at his dreams.â Ay, dad, we'll gather round the Fighting Man. [Exeunt. Scene II. âA Monastery near Gloucester. Anselm and Eadmer. Anselm. God gives His bread to children who are sweet With golden faith; to thinkers and to men Of striving reason He presents a stone, That they should toil and find the heav'nly food The sinews of the brain have strength to win. O Edmer, when my thought was weak and glad As a young bird that only knows the nest; When as a child of Italy I lay Asleep, the mountains lifted round my home, My spirit wandered from my little bed, And walked upon the heights; 'twas harvest-time, And maidens paused above the plenteous sheaves. Methought I'd climb to Heaven and complain How slowly they were binding the red corn. I reached the hall of Heavenâit was still; The Lord and His good butler keeping house, But all the angels were a-harvesting. A childish tire was plaintive in my voice That told Him of His servants' negligence; He smiled, and bread was brought; He stooped and put A silver-bleachÃ¨d morsel to my lips; 'Neath His kind brows I ate, and never yet Have lost the strong renewal of that meat. Eadmer. The sweetest story I have ever heard. My pen shall keep it for all future days To learn how Heav'n dealeth with the child. Anselm. How glorious its dealing with the man! It gives not, that his reason may attain, And like a casket in possession hard Close round the gem of absolute belief. Faith is the child's gift, and Philosophy The man's achievement. BlessÃ¨d toil, to walk Where babes are carried past on angel-wings; To compass Mystery, to conquer Space, Subjugate cunning Time, Eternity's Protean shapes, and changes to illude Man's recognition: in our mind to clutch The veritable Being, force it yield And re-assume itself. Eadmer. Too high your thoughts. I cannot reach the level of your joy. Anselm. Nay, Edmer, hark! It is Philosophy That knocks at Heaven's gate; Faith finds the door Wide openâ'tis the hand of Thought that calls St. Peter to his charge; he opens wide; And the mind enters with the awful tread Of deep assurance that vast home sublime Of the Supreme Idea, and beholds Th' ineffable Existence. I have toiled And fasted, in the midnight watches cried, Consumed the light within me nigh to ash, And desolated human frailty 'neath The march and stress of battling Intellect, To reach that certain knowledge of my God, Clothed in perfection of reality. Eadmer. O rare and mighty thinker, and withal A holy, loving saint, I can but write The chronicle of your loved destiny, That walks along the earth; when you aspire To God, your pen is sole historian Of beatific life beyond mine eyes. Anselm. Dear English Edmer, thy meek, fervent soul Hath often rested where I toil to stand. My life's disciple, we will never part, Till Death give promise we shall ever join In bond that no mortality assails. The King of England holds me in his realm; But when he grants me passage to my home At streamy, wooded Bec, thou too shalt come, And write the tale of Man for men to be; And I will follow to its virgin source The soul that makes his being's sacred worth. So will we work in cloister'd peace, no storm Of outward passion piercing our still days. [Enter Monks with a Messenger.] 1st Monk. Most holy fatherâ 2nd Monk. Blessed Anselm, hear! 1st Monk. This man is from the king, who lieth sick Well-nigh to death. Messenger. He groans and cries for help As he were drowning in the fear of death. Anselm. I cannot go. Messenger. A cruel word to pass From lips reputed kind. He sobs for aid Against the demons mocking at his soul. Anselm. I cannot go; a fear I may not name Stands in the path you show me. There are men Of comfortable spirit nigh the king. Why will you pierce my heart with augury Of doom to all my hopes? Messenger. Nay, never fear He'll give us our archbishop: there he's stiff As yew, and fatal to his people's pray'r. Anselm [aside]. The peace, the wooded monastery. Oh! My books, my problems, and the lonely strife With mystery, the joyous blessing won!â Seek for another comforter. My fate Is sealed with condemnation if I go. Messenger. No other man can save our lord the king From anguish such as makes his dying hour The vestibule to Hell. 1st Monk. Oh, pity him. 2nd Monk. Have mercy on his wicked panting soul. Anselm. I cannot goâyet, Edmer, think of it! No soothing, no access of grateful peace As herald of Death's perfect silencing; All conflict, insurrection, and affright, That put to shame the calm invincible Whose presence stills the threshold. I must go, To shed some dew before the coming night, And make its shade more gentle. Eadmer. He is won. The stricken king will feel upon the air The benediction of his gracious age. Anselm. The poor aghasted soul. 1st Monk. Ay, think of it; The terrible, black exit. 2nd Monk. And the lone, Fire-beaconed journey. Eadmer. And the final death.â Tears make his eyes more precious. He is won. Anselm. The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, draws My feet to carry its sweet messages. I come.âEadmer, how the future hangs Its chains upon my calling, which is thought And meditation on eternal truth. Thus could I freely serve, and yet my God, I know, will bind my lot to slavery. [Exeunt. Scene III. âThe King's sick-room at Gloucester. Round the bed, William of St. Calais, Bishop Walkelin, Bishop Gundulf, Bishop John de Villula, Flambard, Bishops, Nobles, and many Attendants. Rufus. He has me down; He's bending over me To give my soul the death-grip; but I yield.â Good Villula, fling that vile potion down, And pray for me. Your king is perishing Th' eternal way. De Villula. Imagination Conjures the devil; 'tis a fatal case. Rufus. Fie, fie, the devil! I could fling him off; God's overpressing me ... and I confess. I sore repent my many grievous sins. Oh, oh! the sickness strangles me at heart. I will amend.âThis cold is damning me. De Villula. Put yonder skins about his feet. My lord, This little potion hath a kindly heat, Is cheery against shivers in the blood. Rufus. Plague strike you! you are for the gallipot; There is no bishop in you. Oh these brârâriâbes. ... Gundulf. God strikes him in the mouth. Walkelin. His blasphemy Brought on this stuttering. Gundulf. To seal your groans As those of penitence, dismiss your sins By righteous reparation for all wrong. Set free the captives, with death-chainÃ¨d hand Undo the living fetters. Meulan. And forgive The debtor. Gundulf. Yield her pastors to the Church. Rufus. I'll do all this. Good souls, deliver me. Gundulf. To God belongs deliverance, my king. But dare you lose His mercy by the sin Of keeping in a wailing bondage drear The Church of Churches, Christ's most holy Church Of Canterb'ry? Rufus. I never soldâ De Villula. Forbear. The pulse is flapping like to dying wings; And what an eagle perishes!âBut see, Here comes the doctor to the stricken soul, The good physician, who with holy words Can heal the spirit's ulcer, and refresh With draughts celestial. Holy Anselm, peace And benediction! [Enter Anselm, Eadmer, Eustace, and Baldwin of Tournay.] Anselm. Doth the king still live? Gundulf. In penitence he toils to breathe his last. Anselm. What counsel have ye dropped into his ear, How made its chest the treasury of grace? How have ye moved him? Gundulf. 'Tis the might of God Hath cleft his stubbornness; our feeble lips Have urged confession, reparation, all The duties of the dying penitent. Anselm. 'Tis well. Walkelin. Our lips are weak, but thine are strong. Urge thou the only hope, the only means. Gundulf. Lord Anselm, holy father, speak to him. He lies with sickened cheeks and haunted eyes. Speak. Walkelin. We beseech thee, speak. Flambard. Nay, comfort him; A cup of good red wine. De Villula. Inflammat'ry! Damnation! not a drop. Lord Anselm, speak: He sees you. Anselm. Peace be to the penitent. My king, I have strange hope that you will live And leave this lowly bed of languishing, If with a hearty will you turn from sin, And rule your people with mild righteousness. Will your soul promise this? Rufus. All, all. Anselm. To rule With justice and with mercy, to unbind The links of bondage, pardon every debt, Restore its shepherd to each mourning Church, So help you God. Rufus. So help me God, I will. Renew this promise made in His dread Name To God before the altar. Bishops, go. Anselm. Let the clerks write a proclamation, sealed, Lord Chancellor, by you, to tell the land That deeds will flow from promise unto God. Gundulf. There is one other sin upon his soul: He gives the Church no primate. Walkelin. Fill the See. St. Calais [aside]. Perchance my time hath come. Gundulf. Receive our pray'r. Rufus. So do I purpose. St. Calais. Ha! Walkelin. He will. Flambard. Attend. Gundulf. Laus Deo! Let our lord the king make known Whom he deems worthy. St. Calais. See, he tries to rise! De Villula. 'Tis perilous. Rufus. I choose this holy man, Anselm. The Nobles. O joy! The Bishops. A blessed word! Praise, praise! Joy, joy to England! Bring the past'ral staff. Hail, our Archbishop, hail! Eadmer. How wan he grows, And shivers like a tree against the axe. Anselm [aside]. 'Tis on me! I am victim of this hour. Cover me from the conflict! Clear as sightâ The silent cloister, and my brazen lamp, The vaulting that I look to in my thought, The seven ribs that cross it! [Aloud.] No, no, no! I am not your Archbishop. Peace!âNo more Would meditation visit me.âNo pow'r Shall make me your Archbishop.âAnd the care And conflict.âI am old, unworthy, weak. Walkelin. Lay hands upon him. Meulan. Drag him to the bed. Anselm. I am the subject of another realm; I owe allegiance to his Grace the Duke; To mine Archbishop all obedience. Walkelin. Fight not the will of God, nor cast aside His choice; a work is ready to your hands. Abominations breed and multiply; Christ's holy faith is well-nigh dead and gone From English shores. Gundulf [aside]. By that man's tyranny We, and the Churches that we ought to rule, Fall into danger of eternal death. [Aloud.] Wilt thou, when thou canst help us, scorn our pray'r? Anselm. I may not grant itânever. Walkelin. Cruel saint, The mother Church of Canterbury kneels. Wilt thou not raise her up? Anselm. I am unused To worldly business. Let me lead the life And keep the peaceful calling that I love. Gundulf. Show us the way of God, and pray for usâ Discharge of business be our humble trust. Anselm. All that ye do and purpose is but naught. Walkelin. Our lord the king, the abbot is self-willed And obstinate. We pray you speak to him. Rufus. O Anselm, you condemn me to the flames. Recall your faithful friendship to my sire And mother. By that friendship, save their son; Save, I adjure thee, soul and body. Death For ever will confound me if I die Still holding the archbishopric. O help, Then help me, lord and father! Anselm. Would to God That I might die! Good brothers, help me, help! Baldwin. If 'tis the will of God that so it be, Who shall withstand His will? Rufus. Kneel, bishops, kneel. Bishops [to Anselm]. You scant his dying breath, fulfil with gall His moments' strait enclosure. All the sins, Oppressions in the land will heap the door Of your most ruthless, closed, and barrÃ¨d heart. Our knees are round its threshold. Anselm. Lo, I fall Before you in my soul's extremity. You are a bitter crowd to force my mind Against its inborn judgment that my life Was meant to be a temple to God's thought, A shrine for Truth, who seeks her worshippers Where silence is as marble round the air. I am a still old man. Upon my knees I pray you break not on God's solitude That's reared about my brain. Gundulf. He fights with God. The king holds out the staff. Walkelin. Which he shall take, Tho' clenched his hand. Meulan. Raise his forefinger. So! [They force the staff into his hand. All. Long live the Bishop! Walkelin. Take him to the church. Anselm. Ye act in ignorance. The king will live. Why will ye yoke an old and feeble sheep With a young bull untameable and fierce? Your joy will sink to sorrow. I shall fall A victim, and the king will trample you Beneath his unchecked feet. Alas, alas! [Exeunt, dragging Anselm and chanting Te Deums. De Villula. The pulse is firmer and the breath more sure. Scene IV. âHastings. A Street. Enter Bishop Gundulf, Eadmer, and Baldwin. Gundulf. Alas! the dew of penitence is dry, And parched the healÃ¨d soul. Once more the blood Swells through the kingly veins with shining red; But in its triumph grace is overthrown. The king is hard and healthy, and his strength, New-knit by God, is braced to threat the sky In horrible revenge. With him I strove, And prayed him cherish in his days of sun His roughly-scattered, precious, winter seed. His visage fired and deepened till the gem Of darkest blood within his crown was pale To the swart blush of fury as he swore: âA good man God shall never find in me; I have too deeply suffered at His hands.â With that he sent to bind about the limbs, Slack with sweet-breathing freedom, the close chains; His gifts were straight recalled; each debt was held Due as of old, and all that he had sworn Undone in doing. Eadmer. Save the heavy grant To our dear master, who hath borne hard days And looks for no relief. Gundulf. How suffers he? Eadmer. The king is bent against the Norman duke, And hath much need of money. To his feet Cometh our master with the ready gold, Which, sweetly tendered, is received with grace. But afterward, thro' lust of wealth, the gift Is scorned as small and sent unkindly back. But he who is a father to the poor, A most sweet mother to the sick and pinched, Would take no further from his lacking churls; But poured the spurned gold in the beggar's lap Compassionate. This moved the king to wrath, Which still sits cloudy on his thankless brow. Here by the sleepy verge of this green strait The ships await the rising of the wind, And holy Anselm stays to bless the fleet. Baldwin. The breeze will sleep, while the Court reeks with sin, Monstrous and strange. Our dear Archbishop grieves, Resentful, with armed looks. Eadmer. A seraph's zeal Is sworded in his eyes; his stainless brow Is Faith's own shield. Gundulf. The people love him well. Eadmer. He is their blissful advocate. Our race Ties round his heart its locks of flaxen hair As once they bound the Roman Gregory. Baldwin. Methinks your king's damnation pains his soul; Eadmer says that he will seek his side With moving low entreaty. Gundulf. Let us hence, And see how looks the ocean's sterile plain That with our fair fleet should be forested. Baldwin. A wind! Methinks a tiny brook of air Steals down the parchÃ¨d channels of this calm. Gundulf. Too fond a hope! Let's to the water side. [Exeunt. Scene V. âHastings: a Room. The King moodily pacing to and fro, and from time to time flinging his head out of the window to feel the wind. Rufus. Curse the still winds, as huswives they keep close And dare not stalk abroad to work my will. They are for Robert: were they tangible, I would uneye and mutilate the knaves. I must take ship for Normandy; subserve, Ye elements; it will be worse for you If now ye palter with me. I will rule O'er England, Normandy, the stubborn sea, And you, ye lurking cravens. To mine aid Or, by the Heavenly Feetâ [Looks out, cursing wildly. [Enter Anselm.] Anselm. BelovÃ¨d son. Rufus. Father, you caught me in profanity. This calmâ Anselm. On Saturday you were at prayers. I would hold counsel with you: let us sit Together, while I tell you all my heart. [They sit together.] You go to war; it is an enterprise On which you need God's blessing, and He looks Upon a realm that through your wickedness Is left unfenced to Satan. Dare you ask For favourable winds from Him you mock And in each action of your life blaspheme? Rufus. How sayest thou? Did I not hear the mass At Battle Minster? Showed I impious? Anselm. Nay, for in heart you trembled at the thought Of your great sire whose will you reverenced Rearing a church that should confirm his praise For Senlac's fight victorious. I marked The struggle in you; for the wailing souls We prayed, who on Calixta's awful day, Passed unabsolved to Christ. More bitterly, As one who hath long fasted for your sake, Importunate as widow to the judge Slow in reprisal, I laid hold on God, Firm not to loose Him from the bond of prayer, Till He had blessed me with your penitence. The tears you dropped men said were for your sire; I, looking up, beheld the angels' eyes Dewy with joy; and knew the weeping king Was praying for the servant's hire in place Of the lost rank and nearness of a son. Rufus. Lost, lost, yea damned! If there were any hope I dare not curse. God has a memory For old offences, and they spring up fresh With every vicious phrensy of the blood. Mend me? I am incorrigible. Speak! What remedy is in your conscience? Anselm. Let me hold synod ere the council part. We will denounce the sins effeminate That spread corruption on this English ground; And scourge with spiritual whips the slaves Bartering their manhood's birthright-liberty. Help me to stay this curse; and for your soulâ I'd part with all the riches of my faith So I might offer it a precious pearl To Christ the treasure-seeker. Cleanse yourself, Bow in the dust; then peaceful as a child That waits in patience the authority That honours him with business or command, Pause for the favouring wind. Rufus. And did I choose Stir in the matter, what would come of it For you, Archbishop? Anselm. Nothing: but for God Much, and for you. [Enter Eadmer.] Edmer! He brings some news Of import, thus to break our privacy. [To Eadmer]. Seek'st thou the king? Eadmer [to the King]. Oh pardon, that I thus Present the mariners' impatient prayer For instant embarkation. All's astir; The sails already flutter as 'twere March, And the sea wrinkles. Rufus. Jolly messenger! I was about to get me to my prayers, But find my royal menaces suffice To earn the traitor-winds' submission. I stood and cursed them at the casement there, And now they throng with halters round their necks, Craving my pardon, humble to fulfil My instant order;â'tis Embark for France. I'm with you. [To Anselm.] Good Archbishop, do not stay To bless our sail at Hastings. We are safe Under the Devil who walks to and fro About the earth, and snorts out mighty winds. Farewell! [Rushes out. Anselm. My Edmer, we will quit the court With speed, and [looking after the King] henceforth leave him to his will. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âDusk: a Glade of the New Forest. Enter from the shade the King, Gilbert of Clare, Walter Tirel, William of Breteuil, and Attendants. Rufus. My horse dead in the hunt; and you dismount! It was an ugly omen; we will leave His carcase in the forest: men will say His rider next will fall, a merry jest! Breteuil. My liege, I pray you put away this mood; I am pursued by a fell lunatic, A strange distempered man, who dogs my steps Importunate as sinner for his shrift; And all his burdenââWoe, woe to the king In the thick shade:âit is the seat of woeâ The leaves drop poison on him; bid him seek His safety in the hall of Winchester.â And oft as I rebuke him he grows wan, As if with fearful prophecies withheld; His silence so appalling me I turn And desperately ravage on his thought, Which yielded dumbs me with its ghastliness. His utterances keep no steady pace; They flit and flicker as a spirit's form Checked and recurring. Give the omen heed. Tirel. I've snapt my bow-string, sure our sport is crost. Clare. It's growing dun, and these accursÃ¨d leaves Thicken the texture of the dark. Our path Is broken into bog; unless we chance Upon some peasant tramping through the gorse To his embowerÃ¨d cot, we shall keep watch Till season of these apparitions 'rise. Rufus. Tush, Gilbert; you're too often on your knees: These taxes make men superstitious; Extortion is unsettling to the brain. At cost of a few harmless idiots We'll fill our câcâoâoffers . ... Gilbert, you are dull, You cannot grasp my huge ambition; In kingship I have yet my spurs to win. What, king of England, Scotland's overlord! Robert is penniless; I'll buy his lands From these pinched peasants; I require more coast, More land, more races under sovereignty. I covet; and defy the great command To earth's horizon: my rapacity Knocks at the very gates of Rome itself. I'll not be baulked. Breteuil. Oh, vaunt at Westminster; But here there is miasma in the air; 'Tis not a spot for blasphemy. Rufus. Let's lure Our lord archbishop down to bless the place; And while he makes it wholesome, may the pest Of a marsh-fever blast him! It grows dark. The busy twilight 's weaving bushes now, And all we know of Malwood's vicinage Is that the forest girds it; and the trees [Enter Beowulf.] Here multiply about us. In a word, I'm hungry, gentlemen; I'd drink the health Of this wood-genius that is dogging me In a fair flagon. Clare. Yonder! Curb your mouth. [Beowulf disappears Did you not see a monster? Tirel. Hollow-eyed, Ghostly about the temples, terrible. [Aside.] Heaven will send instruments to punish him, If he thus fronts audaciously the threat Of these dire portents. [Aloud.] Let us to our prayers; Hell's habitants are rousing from their sleep. Rufus. Our prayers? You shall say grace before we dine; Starving, my lips shall never trudge to Heaven. [Re-enter Beowulf.] Let's question yonder spectre in the mist. A burly shade! Tirel. He'll trap us to our death. I'll back to horse. Rufus. My gallant followers! Breteuil. We ne'er have been aghasted on the field; When God draws shapes upon the air, no eye Can look upon the doomful images. Clare. It is a fresco from the wall of hell To fright us to repentance. Rufus [approaching Beowulf]. Eyeless knave, Look toward me with your knees; I am your king. Tirel. He's taller than a man; he's stalking close. Breteuil. Now I discern it is some blinded hind, With treason lurking in the hollowed cells Of his orbs' cavities. Keep watch on him. [Standing near Beowulf with a whip. Beowulf. You are my king? I dare you strike at me. You're out a-hunting? Rufus. I don't trap my game; You're not for royal sport who cannot run. Come now, mine honest yeoman, I'll forgive That ancient treason that hath cost thy sight, And re-instate thee in my royal love, So thou wilt snuff the track to Malwood lodge. Beowulf [goes a little apart]. It must be here: your voice has lit the torch Of the very moment; yes, it must be here, Where earth has soaked your curses up like rain To feed the swelling fibres of your fate. Here have you planted your malignant sway; Here have you taught us resignation; Here are you absolute. [Breteuil with his whip cuts Beowulf's forehead.] It must be here Where your vile hand ... Breteuil. The king hath struck you not. I caught my whip across the insolence Of your audacious brow: leave prophecy Or I will lop your lifted hand. Rufus. Let be: His fearlessness assuages me; I'm used To threats of holy men. [To Beowulf.] Presage your worst. [Aside.] I have not cringed to Anselm; here's a power I would not grapple with; it's like the town My limbs shook at the siege of ... just a fit. [Enter Purkis.] Here is another, and a merrier fiend. How now? wilt fright us? Purkis [to Beowulf]. You old torment, come! What has the moon to say to you, i' faith? Will you not home till curfew? [To Attendants.] Used to be A bell at the little church; they cut its tongue At time of the great clearing; doesn't pay, This mutilation, makes us all confused To have to look about for eyes and hands. One needs one's senses pat. [To Beowulf.] Old lumber-brain, The frogs are croaking; I must haul you home. Rufus. Stay! As I am a knight, my merry knave, Your voice hath something of the lantern in 't And promises good guidance. Jovial churl, Your king is tangled in his forest-boughs; Release him from his toils: direct his train The nearest way to Malwood. Purkis [to Attendants]. Keep the trees Well to the left; the lodge is on the height. [To King.] My liege, this is my father; he is old; And though the dark's indifferent to his eyes, He's open to the chill. By your good leave I'll take him off to roost. [Purkis retires with Beowulf. Rufus. My mother's soul, He's a rare son! This filial reverence Shall be rewarded. [To Attendants.] Do you know this knave? Attendants. Purkis, the charcoal-burner. Rufus. Let him own His bit of blasted ground: he's duteous. [To Attendants.] Convey our pleasure to the churl. I'd fear I tell you, gentlemen, to wrong a piece Of so sweet filial courtesy: let's on. I've laid the spectres;ânay, that is the moon Smiling benignant on us. [Exeunt. Scene II. âEnter St. Calais, conning a parchment, and at intervals writing. St. Calais. William is CÃ¦sar of our island-world: This must be emphasized; the Scots expel His proffered king, and Wales triumphantly Throws down his barrier-castles. 'Tis the hour When faith is feeble to enforce a creed. The king is Emperor, though evidence Err in defect, and to refuse a Pope Is his prerogative. [Enter Robert of Meulan and Flambard conversing.] Anselm shall bow. Abjure his Urban, or resign the staff I would receive submissive. [Looking up as he perceives Robert of Meulan and Flambard.] Think ye not Our king doth suffer loss of dignity From the Archbishop's scruple? He remains Unconsecrated till the pallium From Rome invest him. Meulan. We are full of it; And come to urge you press the just complaint. Flambard. The treasuryâthe famine of the purse Makes me most secular. A vacant see Would feed it, if the king were pastoral In his authority. Meulan. Bold prater, peace. Flambard. Nay, but my talents are for candlestick, Not bushel-hiding. I deserve some praise. Know you how grew your truce with Normandy? Did I not summon troops,âstout Englishmen, Each with the money of his maintenance, Loyal to serve the king beyond the sea, And at the water's edge dismiss the fools, Their good bread-money garnered in my handâ Ten thousand pounds, with which we bribed the French? You shall give honour to my arguments; For reason must express necessity As if she had a choice: it is her art, And I have learnt it. Money we must have. Is there not talk of a crusade? May be We shall buy Normandy, while Robert fights In Palestine: our king, not covetous, But of fraternal love and piety Must pour his crowns down for the holy cause. This he can do, if Canterbury yield Her due revÃ¨nues. Meulan. Openly, our aim Must be devotion to the royal will In everything. [To St. Calais.] Now, my lord bishop, come. You are our spokesman, and must presently To our rebellious primate read a scroll From your own lips that clearly shall present Choice 'twixt submission and stern banishment. [Exeunt. Scene III. âRockingham. A Hall, divided by folded curtains. In the outer chamber, Anselm, Eadmer, Baldwin, and other Monks, Clerks, and Laymen. Within the presence-chamber, the King, Robert of Meulan, other Nobles, and Bishops. Anselm. Come forth, ye lords and bishops.âI will stand. Edmer, my stole is falling; set it right. Good friend, my thanks. [Enter from within Bishop William of St. Calais, Bishop Walkelin, Bishop John de Villula, and other Bishops and Nobles.] Walkelin. A seat of easy slope. We're like to be long sitting. St. Calais. Peace!âMy lord Of Meulan, to the right there's room. Anselm. Attend. I fain would take from hands pontifical The woollen scarf, the cross-marked pallium, That sets its final honour to the rank And office ye have forced me to assume. My king denies me, tells me with harsh breath My wish would snatch his crown, and that my faith Plighted to him, and mine obedience To Urban plighted, are as day and night Opposed beyond all harmony. To sin Against that faith and this obedience Were heavy condemnation. But I hope That you will bring them side by side as friends And linkÃ¨d true associates. I pray Your help and counsel in my strait; but chief, My brother bishops, help me of your love, For you have laid this strange perplexity Upon my burthened soul in choosing me To rule your Church. St. Calais. You are a man of God, A lover at the feet of holiness, Why ask our counsel? But if so you ask, Throw yourself wholly on your monarch's will, And we'll essay advice. De Villula. But if you plead A call on God's behalf to thwart the king, We cannot give you help. Eadmer [aside]. The spaniels cringe As if the air were parting for the lash. [Looking at Anselm.] How reverend his face! his raisÃ¨d eyes Are jewels of God's light. Anselm. And thus you speak, Shepherds and princes, and no counsel give Save as the will of one man shall allow; Then to the Shepherd and the Prince of all I turn for aid. I unto CÃ¦sar give The things of CÃ¦sar; unto God the things Of God. In what is godly and divine I to God's Vicar owe obedience; To what is earthly in the dignity Of CÃ¦sar I yield reverence, and bow My vassal-will submissive. St. Calais. Hear! His speech Is traitorous. Walkelin. His words are full of pride. St. Calais. His gross disloyalty is worthy death. [To Anselm.] We will not bear such message to the king. Anselm. Then will I go, for none will speak my words. Eadmer. Dear master, I will bear them to the king, And faithfully uplift them to his ears. Anselm. No, Edmer. Of yon lion I've no dread, Am fearless of his den beyond that bar; [Pointing to the arras dividing the Hall from the presence-chamber. And none but I shall enter. [Passes into the presence-chamber. Curtains drawn back. Rufus [aside]. Here he comes! Now, by the Face of Lucca, this is good. To Anselm.] Your answer, father? Anselm. I to CÃ¦sar owe The things of CÃ¦sar; unto God the things Of God. In what is holy and divine I to God's Vicar owe obedience; To what is earthly in the dignity Of CÃ¦sar I yield reverence, and bow My vassal-will submissive. Rufus. Traitor! bâback! Thou shalt reâreâreturn with other words. [Exit Anselm. Call in My lords and bishops. Meulan. Hither, to the king! [They go into the presence. The curtain falls. Eadmer. Here is a seat. Anselm. I'll lean against the wall.â I am a stranger! Eadmer. Master, though I bear An English name, and have an English face, In thee I have a part. Anselm. Thou hast indeed. My life is like a book before thine eyes; But, Edmer, there are times when men and things Are foreign to the brain and heart and soul, And have no common language and exchange Of sympathies; yet, Edmer, I am still God's fellow-countryman, and by Him known, And never left, avoided, or reviled: So on the Universal Love I rise Above the dreary severance from man. Eadmer. Baldwin, I hear the voices in debate, The king's high stutter and the bishops' whine, And Meulan's serpent-sliding oratory, Ahithophel's own speech. Baldwin. How long they stay: Yet the discussion waxes. Eadmer [pointing to Anselm]. Holy sleep Is on him. It hath left some infant's brow To nestle to his temples. Such a smile As God would light the lamps of Heaven with Is on his face. Baldwin. It is a miracle. Good brother, see! no dream possesses him; He is intent on some reality. Eadmer. The lids close in their treasuries; all here Is left untenanted; he's turned the key On sense, to pace the walks of Paradise Awhile in recreation with his God. Baldwin. They come. [Re-enter from the presence Bishops and Nobles.] Eadmer. I'll touch him gently. Meekest sleep, Here come thy brawling enemies. Anselm. How strange, Unlovely!âEdmer! Eadmer. They are coming back, Forth from the presence. Anselm. There was golden light Before my Judge invisibleâthe light Was feathered close with wings. Eadmer. O master, hear; King William sends them back. St. Calais. Your lord the king Bids you all other words put by to yield Your more confirmÃ¨d answer. Anselm. I attend. St. Calais. You work to snatch the glory of his realm From off your monarch's brow. Who takes away His dignities and customs, takes his crown. Leave thou the useless service of thy Pope; Embrace the fruitful friendship of thy king. Be free, and wait the bidding of your lord In all things; pray for pardon, and your foes, The mockers, shall be put to shame as deep As is your honour high. Anselm. Unto the head And vicar of the Church I will be true. If any man would prove that this my faith To Urban breaks my oath to William sworn, Let him stand forth and I will answer him. [A Knight steps forward.] Knight. Our lord and father, by my humble lips Your suppliant children pray you keep good cheer. Let not your heart be troubled: blessed Job O'ercame the devil on his ashy dung, And thus revengÃ¨d Adam whom the tree Did snakily beguile. Anselm. Thy words are balm. Eadmer. Oh joy, the voice of God, the people's voice, Is lifted in our cause. Rufus [within]. Bishops and lords. What answer? [Curtain rises. St. Calais goes to the King. St. Calais. Oh, I know not what to speak! I cannot say ... Rufus. How now, thou fool, art dumb? Damnation! not a word? St. Calais. 'Tis only force Can put him down; if he is obstinate Strip off the ring and staff and drive him forth. Meulan. What! Strip your primest vassal of his fief; 'Twould loose the pack of troubles from their case, Nor leave one hope of remedy. Your realm Would rage with high seditions. Never thinkâ Rufus. Will nothing please you? While I live I'll have No equal in my kingdom. Meulan. All our guiles, Close-hanging counsels, like a spider's web, His sleep-refreshÃ¨d lips with single touch Have broken to poor shreds. Rufus. What can be done? I'll tell ye, bishops. Go, and to his face Declare that ye withdraw your fellowship And loyalty. Ho, ho! He will be shamed, And groan that ever he has left his lord To follow after Urban. Hence! St. Calais. We go. Eadmer [to Anselm]. They come again with nodding brows and eyes That shrink before thy countenance. St. Calais. Henceforth We no more love nor serve you, and the king Withdraws protection. Anselm. Ye are wrong. Your love And service are my right, withdrawn from me Because I yield my love and fealty Where yours and mine are due. I will not deal As ye have dealt.âTo you and to the king I'll show a father's love, though you and he Reject me thus. Yet for God's service I Will keep the name, the office, and the power With which ye did endow me, though the press Of outward things is iron on my brain. St. Calais. Proud man, we will report thy words. Rufus [within]. How now? St. Calais. He scorns our harsh rejection. Rufus. All he says Is clean against my pleasure; not a soul Shall be my man who chooses to be his. Barons, withdraw from him all friendship, faith, That he may see his gain in holding thus Against my willâmy will. Meulan. Our gracious lord, We're not his men, we cannot take from him What we have never given. Rufus. Curse themâugh! Meulan [to St. Calais]. Judas! Fitz-hamon [to Walkelin]. Arch-Herod! [To De Villula.] Pilate! St. Calais. Would to God The earth would open! Shame is in my limbs That are base shivering traitors to my will. Walkelin. Fall, fall the roof and hide me. Rufus. Bishops, say! Have ye abjured your whole obedience To Anselm, or but such as he would claim By Rome's authority? St. Calais. All, all, my lord. Rufus. Friend, to the place of honour.âAnswer thou! Walkelin. I have abjured but such obedience As he by Rome hath claimed. Rufus. Go, turn your face To yonder corner, till your chastisement Be ready for your back. Walkelin. My lord, my lord! Rufus. Hence to the corner you who think with him, And those against him welcome to our side. Walkelin [aside]. With heavy coins we'll lighten punishment [They talk together apart in a corner. Rufus [aside]. I know not how to loose him with the staff Still glued between his fingers. [Enter Walter of Albano.] Meulan. See who comes! The Papal Legate, and a pallium Is like a starry night upon his arm, Black, blanched with crosses. Rufus. Hail! You come in time. Place for the Bishop. Albano. Blessings on the king Whose might is such that Urban by my mouth Vows that no legate adverse to thy choice Shall cross the English borders. Rufus. Ha! He doth. [Aside.] Then I'll acknowledge Urban, and this man Will strip old Anselm of his ring and staff; And then we'll pack him safely over seas, And be sole tyrant of his trembling Church. [Aloud.] We for that grace acknowledge Urban Pope. Clerks, write a proclamation to the land And spread it through my empire's length and breadth. [Aside to Albano.] Gold, flaming bullion, burnished mighty mass I'll yearly pay to Rome, if thou wilt take His honour from that traitor. Albano. Yon old man, The pious Anselm, with his gentle lids Between the world and his own holy thoughts!â His mother Church, I warrant, ne'er will lift One grace from off his years. Rufus. By Lucca's Face, I have gained nought through my acknowledgment. Albano. Peace with the Church, peace with her holy son; [Pointing to Anselm. For now ye are conjoined, and in your hearts Is no contention. Meulan. Call him to your love. Rufus. Cursed be my folly,âexecrable tongue That hath betrayed its master! Fetch him up. [Anselm approaches. This holy legate with his honey speech Hath made me Urban's. There is no offence Between us. See, there hangs the pallium; No weary journey, but a step between Possessor and possession. Of the joy You have in this escape from pilgrimage You'll pay the sum our courtesy hath saved To us who spare you? Anselm. Not a coin, my liege. Rufus [aside]. Miser! damned miser!âGive me then your word That you'll obey all customs of the realm And guard them from infringement, so once more We'll call you ghostly father, and return The honours of your title. Anselm. I will swear According to the service of my God. Rufus [aside]. Beshrew you! How I hate the words.âArise, And sit beside me. From my royal hand You shall receive the pallium. Anselm. Not so; The staff I took, for it was yours to give; The other gift is from his hand who sits In Peter's chair. Albano. I'll lay it on the shrine Of Christ in your cathedral, and from thence, Dear, saintly primate, with your proper hand You'll take it from Saint Peter. People. Yea! Anselm. I will. My king, your friendship is the highest boon God's earth could give. Rufus. 'Tis yours. Albano. Behold how good And joyful is the union of twain In brotherly affection. Peace to all. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. âBorders of the New Forest. Enter Beowulf and a crowd of Peasants. 1st Peasant. Still they afforest, still they take our land; They tax us into hunger, and our bread Is in the purse of gold for Normandy. 2nd Peasant. Father, the land is ours? Beowulf. The land is his Who finds in it himselfâhis toil, his time, His hope, his sweat, his sorrow. 1st Peasant. So he prates. I'm sick to death. 3rd Peasant. A tombstone of a man! He comforts with big words and prophecies, And thinks he fools our misery. Because His bonnie eyes of English blue were charred, We put our faith in him. He's dark as night, No cheer nor meaning in him. 1st Peasant. And no aid For famine-stricken mouths. 2nd Peasant. The Ãtheling Will have some heart to help us. 1st Peasant. Michael's Mount Held him in prison. Now he rides the woods With the king's troop and keeps him company: Who loves him loves us not. There is no hope. Beowulf. Wait without hope. I wait till this mute dark Numbers its doomful hours. No tender fall Of light will dissipate its dull excess; 'Twill break up in the imbecility, Confusion, undiscernment of the grave. So will my blindness end; I have no hope, I suffer. ... Hope's a maggot eats the heart From the stout timbers of endurance. Starve. [Enter Old Man: in the distance Officers measuring the land with ropes.] 2nd Peasant. There are the officers. Let's bring him word What they are marking off. If it's the land They're hurting ... 3rd Peasant. Ay, he says the Earth's himself, He put his flesh and blood in 't, just as if He'd dug a grave within it for his child. [They go apart. Old Man. It's sore to see him; he stands like a tree Infect with autumn. I will speak with him. [To Beowulf.] Art thinking of the grave? Beowulf. Why, man, your voice Minds of the russet-apples that I stole With Edgar in the orchard. Are you he? Old Man. Ay, ay, your ancient play-mate. Beowulf I fear you're clouded by these ominous Murmurs and threats, and in your suffering Sigh for the humble strewings of a grave. Beowulf. I'm not impatient; if by rotting down One might break earth of her sterility! ... As for the rich they're misers of their mould; No crumb of their corruption will they fling The famished earth. Old Man. Nay, nay, you're with the worms! There are tombs clean and dry, though a poor man May not inhabit such, the thought of them Is pleasant; they are strong and quaintly cut. One may lie there With all one's bravery. 'Tis even said The moth doth not corrupt. Could a man dwell In such a tomb till resurrection-morn He were lodged peacefully. Beowulf. I will not rise; I'm used now to the dark; a flare of saints Would hurt me like the scorch of the hot brass That withered up my sight. Old Man. Be comforted. The Lord will judge the tyrant. Beowulf. How you talk! Do you think the Earth's a thing that makes your flesh Soft for the worms?âthe harvests lie asleep Upon her bosom; she has reared the spring; The seasons are her change of countenance; She lives; and now for many thousand years Hath ruled the toiling and the rest of men. There's none like her for judging the true way, Quick'ning the weeds, setting the twitch to work, Or blasting with sterility: she'll judge. Old Man. In sooth there have been prodigies and dreams. I have had one most marvellous; methought As I was fishing in the Stour, the tide Grew ruddy, and the milky placid stream Heaved turbulent, while in my weighty net Smirk'd finny demons; but I drew the haul, Crossing myself, untrembling to the shore. Eh, eh! I drowned the devils with the sign Yet verily these portents show the earth And sea and sky are must'ring for a curse. You do not mis-interpret. [Re-enter Peasants.] 1st Peasant. All is gone. My little plot, my home; they'll turn it all To forest for the king. 3rd Peasant. And what is left To till is taxed where plough can never reach, And spade were choked with furze. 2nd Peasant. We'll beat them off. An' teach them they're not hunting deer to-day, But men with staves and children. 1st Peasant. Beat them down! [Exeunt in tumult. Old Man. He's sicklied as he were about to die; The still-born curses hang upon his lips; Yet I believe he's praying. Beowulf, Do thou make known this matter to the Lord; He will avenge. Beowulf. The Lord! Oh, He's above! There's something lying at the roots of things I burrow for. Old Man. Good brother, one is down In the encounter and they beckon me. Think on your sins, for I must succour him, And by the pallor of your face I judge Your end is come. [Exit. Beowulf [supporting himself against a rock-bound oak]. O mighty in resource, Earth, wilt thou suffer loss of liberty Unquivering? A rope about the land! [A noise heard: the Officers advance.] 1st Officer. Make way, you blundering lout. 2nd Officer. Oh, he's a stump, Let him be bound'ry! Trail the cord along. Measure from this blind peasant to yo oak Ten rods. [Looking at Beowulf.] He's unresistent. Beowulf [clasping the rock]. Oh, revenge! Scene II. âA Room. Enter Flambard with a letter. Flambard. This from my mother. [Reads.] âI am pelted, stoned, Hooted, bedraggled, cursed at for a witch. Save me, sweet Ralf, bid me come over seas; Under my son's protection I am safe: But here in Bayeux, naked, sorrowful, I creep about the corners of the streets, And spit upon the Christians like a Jew From my dark covert.ââAh! the evil eye, The malice of the woman! Very like She is a witch. The devil certainly Is my true sire. [Enter Messenger.] Messenger. So please you, she entreats For money, and due escort, till she touch The land where she may safely walk abroad; Since by the terror of your name men's tongues Wag circumspectlyâthis she urged me add, Fearful the penman had not set her plaint As eloquent as from her tingling lips It issued voluble. Flambard [giving a paper]. Despatch. I send This paper and these bags. Looked she in health When she dictated this? I know her way,â Her speech warmed at the embers of her eyes, She never paused till bursting in a laugh To see the scribe with tortoise, toiling hand A-cramp to copy all. [Exit Messenger.] She's given me My ready tongue. How should a man serve God By his fine wit? God has no work for him; Whereas the devil turns to good account All lies, concupiscence, and avarice. He keeps the brain at labour all the day: I like employment; haply in my age I may take lighter service. [Enter William Rufus.] Rufus. Serious! Now by my mother's soulâ Flambard. Most opportune The oath; both you and I are filial: We can't forget the look in parents' eyes, The victor's triumph and the miser's lust Softened to such a human coveting As empties the brimmed coffers of the eyesâ Rufus. True, my fair Chancellor. I can't forget The Mora bore a figure-head, a boy Vermilion-cheeked, with clust'ring golden hair. My father held me up to look at him; His kiss rubbed harsh against my pouting lips Agape in wonder, frighting me,âI screamed And kicked, but heard him whisper, pressing close, âThis the man-child upon whose head I fix The English royaltiesâa stalwart son!â Ralf, my ambition ripes; 'tis harvest-time; The Conqueror's prophecy must be fulfilled, Surpassed;âaccomplishment exceed presage. I must have all becomes an emperorâ Wealth, vassals, territory to the steep Of mountain ramparts inaccessible; Where with the pasture fails the shepherd's flock, Be first my name unfrequent. Solitude Ridge my supremacy. How grows the gold? I must be prodigal; my nature sweats Munificence; 'tis healthy to perspire. Come now, let's look into thy register. Flambard. Sire, it exceeds belief how priests will rob The churches, melt the consecrated gold, Expose the saint a shamÃ¨d penitent Stripped to the shirt, and from the skeleton Pluck the loose, dusty ring: they have no awe, And the revenue waxes. Rufus. Hoo, hoo, hoo! [Throwing money on the table. A bellyful of laughter! Thirty marks I cast down on this table, as my mite Toward the ten thousand owed for Normandy. How thinkest thou I earned them? Flambard. Honestly? Nay, but by pious subterfuge. Rufus. A Jew Came to me weeping o'er his recreant lad, Subtle St. Stephen drove to baptism, As Christ the swine to perish in the sea. Would I command the convert to abjure (Here shook the knave his lusty money bags), He would show grâratitude. So I professed Compassion, fronted the rebellious boy, And darted on him such a fiery look As half-fulfilled my threat to rend his eyes. He feigned to think I jested. My shrewd Ralf, The youth was shameless in his piety, And would not be abashed. But afterward I claimed, as payment of my royal pains, Half the fore-promised fee; and Abraham, With his lost child, lost gold, lost impudence, Turned stubborn on his heel. Flambard. Sire, I predict The heavy Anselm will resign his staff, So groans he at the vast extortion Of the oppressÃ¨d Church. If he retire And leave you wolfish pastor of the flockâ [Enter Anselm unseen at a distance.] Anselm [aside]. Alas! I'm tired in soul, and for the south I pine to death as winter-stricken bird; There is the pain of thwarted wings within The care-barred prison of my cÃ²nfined brain. Oh, I must fly to Rome, where comfort, rest, And light would fall as summer on my grief. Rufus. Anselm! The name offends me. He hath lost My Welsh campaign. The pious gentlemen, His duteous addition to my ranks, Took field more like the drooping garrison Of a surrendered city than a troop Of knights, fresh, emulous, and fair-disposed. His sheep are for the slaughter. Anselm. True, my lord. They have a deathly look; their means of life Is swallowed by your officers; their blood Is shed with their last coins. Rufus. Shut up your jaws! Anselm. My lord, I comeâ Rufus. The rot consume your sheep Anselm. To ask a favour for myself. Rufus. For you? Anselm. That I may journey for a little space To Romeâthe shrine of comfort raised aloft On seven-pillared hills. My native skies Have lately dyed my memory. I long For cloudless sun and heaven-tinctured peace. My spirit fails for counsel and relief Of holy love and guidance fatherly. Thought leaves me, and the level mists of life Envelop vision and distort all truth, Till I am lost and weary. Rufus. Am I mad? Look I insane? No, by my mother's soul, You shall not leave my billow-guarded shore. No, no, good father. Have you done a deed So black and deadly that the Pope alone Can give you absolution? By God's face, I never will believe it. Would you ask The Pope for counsel? You might give him such With far more fitness than receive 't of him. You have no need to go. Anselm. All pow'r is yours, And as you will you speak. Another day What you refused you royally may grant. I'll multiply my pray'rs.âAnd patience rule The fever of my soul. [Exit. Rufus. Ho, ho! Well heard. Ay, now he's sick and shall be penitent. How I will taunt him! Sick of hearing bleat His hungry lambs, he's off to quiet feed On the green pastures of the Roman slope. I will be bitter. Go you after him, Say his petition has much moved the king, Who threatens worse oppression. [Exit Flambard. It is odd; I plague this saint and cannot part with him. The company of fiends is tedious; One must have something holy to torment, Andâand ... if fever struck me down again, I should have hunger for the face of God, Though it should damn me. He's a remedy Not to be loosed from hand. I'll make him smart. [Exit. Scene III. âWinchester: a Street, leading to the Council Chamber. At the door a crowd of Townsfolk. Enter Purkis, with a cart laden with apples, accompanied by Godric. Purkis. So now they think the world's whole business is being settled within four walls. And they stand gapingâ never see it's the harvest, and the harvest-men who break the ground and build fuel that determine things. Can't you gape at me? I'm the charcoal-burner; 'twas a trade before that of the bishop or the tax-gatherer, and is likely to continue, though my Lord Anselm show his whims. 1st Citizen. It is come to Council; 'tis the great event. Purkis. Ay, whether the Archbishop may take a holiday in Rome. 2nd Citizen. Oh, the bishops are with the king, and most of us townsfolk in a wonder one of so gentle a disposition as our Lord of Canterbury should grow restless for his pleasure, while the people endure the bitter onslaughts of calamity. Whom have you here? Purkis. Why the good canon Godric, my brother. But my lord of Twynham liked not the fashion of his piety, soon as he found his purse needed endowment. Out he whips him, tumbles over the stones of the old church, and now is himself dean, patron, architect, and most marvellous mendicant in one. 1st Citizen. Ay, the men of God are mightily abused. Good father, we hope to see you righted. Purkis. There's my boy Wilfrith, never watching the crowd, stuffing his eyes in at the keyhole. So monks and priests misinterpret. All a pother if there's blight on the rose-tree: the smut o' the corn-field never strikes 'em. Well, Wilfrith, what brings you from Twynham? Wilfrith. Love of the holy man we fear to lose. Godric. You have rightly marked himâyet if he fleer at the king's authority he must be punished. He must be an Englishman with the rest of us, drink the air of custom, or as a foreigner he'll suffer our misliking. 2nd Citizen. He's for the Pope. 3rd Citizen. He's just for his own ease. He's fleeing away from us, as a woman flees from her man when he catches her lad by the shoulders, with a rod in his other hand. She hasn't strength to resist him, nor pity to stay dress the blue stripes of her beaten brat. She'll just to a neighbour's and recover. 2nd Citizen. For my part I think it's no more than a lunacy. When we're mazed we always want to go back to where we came from. It's natural. But I doubt whether anything turns out well, tried over again. The meat may be the same, but there's age in the appetite. Purkis. Right, man; blue skies are excellent; one leaves them, has the heart-ache and returns for cure to stare heavenward. Our blessings are rarely our remedies. It takes something medicinal in the way of sorrow to restore us. Wilfrith. Father, hush! Here comes good brother Baldwin full of news. [Enter Baldwin from within the Council-chamber.] Baldwin. They have deserted him, he stands alone. His bishops whom he gently did adjure, Choked by the cares of kinship, and the sweet Flesh-woven bands of this entangling world, Refuse to pass beyond the fealty Owed to the king. 2nd Citizen. Good, good! Wilfrith. But the Archbishop will be firm? Baldwin. A martyr's constancy is in his eyes, And a confessor's cheerfulness. He sends Word to the king that he will cleave to God. Soon as the messengers again assail His weary ears, I will return to you. Meanwhile, pray for him. [Exit. Wilfrith. That he may be firm. [Kneels apart. Purkis. Now, la! at a crisis what's the use of one's knees. Muster your wits, man, and leave mumbling. If Father Anselm need a holiday, he should come down to our playground, see the king at his royal sports. Oh, it's merry in the greenwood, and dad roaring like a lion when the officers come near his lair. I should like the Archbishop to encounter him. He's disordered, past my management. 3rd Citizen. He's grown infirm. Purkis. Ay, but not silly, like a dotardâdoes too many things in 's mind at once, and then sits idle like a huswife in the midst. 4th Citizen. I mind me of old Beowulf, the lad Who would sit throwing stones into the pond; We shied them at the birds, the rest of us, And laughed that all he cared for was to see The circles on the water grow and spread All day; by rights he should ha' minded sheep. 3rd Citizen. Well, I can't picture him growing peevish and old. Seemed to me he had senses hidden in himself, as a miser a bag of gold beyond reach. I warrant he'll not sit by the fire and wheeze till bed-time. He's ne'er known the ague. Purkis. No: he's not the litter of ageâinfirmities. Godric, that boy [pointing to Wilfrith] can give you tidings of your absence. How fares it? Is it made much of, or slighted? Wilfrith. We are full of hope, Dear uncle, you will be restored to us; For, since the Bishop of St. Calais pined, Sickened, and died, our restless overseer Grows discontented with his deanery, Neglects to thwart the canons, and repines Our Church should exercise so slenderly Pow'rs of design that for expression need The wealth and domination of a see. All this is from his mouth; the brethren smile And nodding whisper, âFiery Flambard builds, But we shall have our dean to consecrate The beautiful new minster.â Godric. Can it be The bishopric of Durham shall be seized At the king's private pleasure as a boon To Flambard? Purkis. Fortune, imitating Providence, misplants her crops that all in the soil of circumstance may receive the discipline of adversity. This holy man, who in Normandy grew like a watered oak, must now look for his aliment from the heavens. English earth is too impoverished for his nurture. Wilfrith. Oh, father, by his ghostly help he cheered St. Calais, who so deeply wounded him. Each living creature he includes in love; England in him will lose the advocate, The single righteous man, who might prevail To stay the must'ring vengeance of the Lord. Purkis. And dost thou love thy country? Wilfrith. Ay, the souls It breeds for hell and heaven. Purkis [to Godric]. Brother, you? Godric. Sooth, I love it for what is not, the old worship and the old waysâthe Saxon Church. Purkis. Dad, I think, loves it corporeally, for the very mould's sake; while I never fret till the babies pule and the young lasses wear the brows of widows. That enrages me. Anything unnatural in the seasons of life: Youth uncomplaining; Age unquerulous; women too weary-like to use courtesy to their dead; and the only strange thing happening, an encounter with the devil. [Re-enter Baldwin.] Baldwin. Dear brethren, list! a joy is in his eyes; He hears that he may go: the harsh reserve And grasping petty rancour of the king That will condemn him to trudge penniless, He doth not hear: his cheek already glows Ardent, as with the sun of Italy Sooth-tinctured. 3rd Citizen. The good bishopâhe will flee? How said the brother? Godric. Let us be resigned. The king will have his way with us, extort Till life is drained away from us: of men There will be dearth for slaughter. Wilfrith. Our last hope Is gone. Purkis. Nay, lad, look cheerily; God 's everywhere about. The priest may frighten the crows from the harvest; it's the Husbandman knows what He put in the ground and what will come out. Let the Italian back to his blue skies! things will settle, if we've patience. Scene IV. âWithin the Council-hall. The outer chamber. Anselm and Eadmer. Anselm. Edmer, that I should not appeal to Rome, They ask this of me? I appeal to God To guide me to the threshold of His saints. I must away. ... It is an agony That urges me. I must behold the face Of Christ's great soldier, hear of holy wars. It is insufferable I should be fined For sorry trim and escort of my troops, Or bear reproach from any over-lord Save Him who may most righteously complain That I have wronged Him in my negligence. Eadmer. How bitterly you weep!âsevenfold your grief Like the dear Mother's. Anselm. I must flee the world; Necessity is on me. I will start Barefoot and naked to the holy hills, A penitent, and pray for my own peace. Eadmer. The flock, my father, the unsheltered souls? Anselm. O Edmer, I went lonely as a child To pour my angry heart out unto Heaven, And the Lord smiled, and set me down to feast Who paused not by the idling harvesters. I must complain to Him. Eadmer. 'Tis marvellous. You speak of Rome as 'twere Jerusalem. Anselm. There God hath left His shadow upon earth; There is the Bride, the Church; there shall I hear The Bridegroom's voice delighting over her; There is the door to the warm-breathing fold, The Shepherd's blessing, and the pasture's peace. Eadmer. Dear master, I am eager to be gone. Anselm. Nay, but the pang and the extremity, The joy that is too much. [Enter Messenger.] Messenger. My lord, the king Conveys his pleasure thus:â Anselm. My will is fixed; I cleave to God. Messenger. He graciously allows You leave his kingdom; in eleven days Be ready at the haven to receive A messenger, who duly shall provide You and your escort for the pilgrimage. Eadmer. Then shall we onward? You are sick at heart, Home-sick for holiness: you languish here. We'll straightway to our quarters, and be glad In happy preparation. Anselm [to Messenger, pointing to inner chamber]. Is he there, The king? Messenger. The audience is broken up; The bishops and the courtiers intermix, And, past the boundary of our monarch's ears, Lament the land's bereavement. Anselm. But the king? Messenger. He is not wrathful; he sits moodily And meditates beside your grace's chair Without an oath or gesture. I ne'er saw His busy face so still. Anselm. EdmerâO God, Why dost Thou set my love upon the damned? Do not I nightly wrestle for the soul Of Osbern, my beloved? Now in mine age Must I take on my heart the infamies Of this blasphemer? [To Messenger.] I will speak with him. [Aside.] Alas! how oft He hath broke in upon my happy hours Of contemplation! Can it be, in Rome I shall forget him? I will say farewell. [He signs to the Messenger to conduct him to the King. A curtain is drawn back, an inner chamber discovered The King on a throne; a vacant chair beside him. At some distance the retiring Bishops and Courtiers are seen conversing. Rufus [after a long pause]. He shall be banished; from this holy man I will break loose. God is but poorly served In His omnipotence. His hirelings flee Being a-hired, and care not for the flock. I and the devil in duality Will sceptre England, haply Rome itself, And mock this Anselm with his scallop-shell I'll gird him now. He hath stood over me (My neck beneath his foot) we have changed place; He shall make restitution and amends For this annoyance and the sorry aid He furnished me; and I will banish him. ... True, his dove's spirit lay among the pots Of my foul nature, and ne'er soiled her plumes. I liked to feel him close: now in his stead I'll plant Beelzebub. [To his Clerk.] You, William, there, Meet the Archbishop at the water's marge; Search well his baggage: let the crowd look on; Expose the treasons of the runaway. [Aside.] This empty chair ... [Enter Anselm, followed by Eadmer.] Anselm. My liege, I'm starting; if with your good will It had been better; even as it is, I cannot part from love of your soul's health; And now as ghostly father to his son, As Anselm to the king, beseech you take My blessing. Rufus. Father, I refuse it not. [Anselm silently makes the sign of the cross over the King, and blesses him. Anselm [to Eadmer]. Come, Edmer, we are pilgrims, and my shell Is my own yearning heart. [Exit with Eadmer. Rufus. Now he is gone. ... What! my eyes wet? I warrant he shall weep He ever left me. [To Clerk.] William, you are slack; Turn o'er his goods; and we will bâbâbanish him. [Exit Walter; the King buries his face in his hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âThe New Forest. Beowulf (restlessly pacing to and fro). Enter Purkis. Purkis [aside]. There's alteration in the face. His brow, That had the quiet of a leaguered town, Growing a little stiller day by day, Is now a blaze of sortie and assault. [Aloud.] Why, dad, you're looking busy; what new scheme Are you hatching? Is your sight come back again? Beowulf [pulling down a bough of acorns]. One fell down on my head; they're growing ripe. Where is the king? Does he have quiet rest? Purkis. Don't shake like a conspirator. Beowulf. It's come; It's at the doors, and I must witness it. I was at Senlac. Look you well aboutâ I must not miss it; I must see him fall; I saw King Harold. Purkis. Well-aâwell-a-day! We'll to the show and you shall lead me on, Unfold me how the players gib and mince: You are the seeing man. Beowulf. Let's walk about. What is the time of day?âThe August gules ... Purkis. You're mixing things. Beowulf. What was it that I wrought? We must not one be idle. I must help.â I'm young again: my boy, it's coming back, My sight is comingâat the set of sun. Purkis. This is fresh prodigy; he's radiant. There's very twinkle in the leaden sky Of his old eyes; but let them out of cell, He'll be a maniac.âCome, come, to-bed! Beowulf. I'll sleep when it is dark; it's shining now, And I must watch. I am a sentinel;â Ay, that's the word; all things are pressing back. A watch; they chose me for my piercing sight By the hoar apple-tree ... I built the fence. Where is the place? I can't see clearly yet. Let's feel the trunk. Purkis. It's supernatural. I'll haul him to the oak: he's riveted To this one bark.âWe will encamp here, dad. Beowulf. There's a great prospect, even over sea. Ay, it stands well. Purkis. One looks to Pevensey; The sea is glist'ring.âNow he's dulled again. Beowulf. Another time; that was another day. It's overspread with leavesâa better light, And not too dazzling. I will guard the wood. Scene II. âTwynham. The Church completed. Enter Leofric, meeting Old Man. Old Man. Ah, sir, your face is full of happiness; But should they knock that down [pointing to the tower] like the old church? Leofric. Nay, when a mother sees her perfect babe, She thinks not of the doomed calamity To strike his hoary head. Come now, confess It is a goodly pile. Old Man. Ay, a fair heap Of masonry. Young man, you've done your best; I'll not deny itâand the rest is slow. God and the winds must care for it; it needs To be thick-planted with the dead before It will look old enough for worshippers. The Lord Himself, they say, will make all new;â I marvel at Him; but He's fit to judge.â Our forefathers lay still; men had good thoughts In the old place: it seemed a heathen thing To hack it up. Leofric. Nay, it was rough and plain; Not better than a homestead. Old Man. Well, you see God had been there; He did a deal for it. You rumbled up the dead. When there's more graves It will be better. I shall make one soon. You must not think, young man, you do it all. We do our part just rotting in the ground; The saucy urchins feel it's wonderful; We frighten 'em. I do not think the walls Do much; it's what's outside and what is in, Plenty of living sorrow and a Past, Makes one look up.âYou will excuse me, sir,â There's a little girl I buried years ago Here, where the nettles press. I let it be While they were building; now I'll put it right; That's what I'm come for. It is difficult; The weeds so intermix. Leofric. We'll find it out. You have no headstone: I will carve you one, If you would care. Then you will not mistake. Old Man. My little lass was shy of strangers, hid Behind the chair, if they but looked at her. I'll keep her to myself. [Disappears. Leofric. It's useless toil. The people come here to reclaim their dead, Or just to mass. [Enter Flambard.] Flambard. Good even, Leofric. Fair news, my cunning craftsman, do you hear? Your uncle Godric I will reinstate, And allâexcept the beauty of this churchâ Wear its old form. Nay more, my bonnie ladâ I am translated to a northern See; And, hark ye! good St. Calais brought him plans From Normandy, by which we'll raise a church; Ay, Leofric, a dominant, dark pile, That shall express the State's stability, And keep the fortress in its very mould; A mighty, militant, majestic mass. You shall notch out the saint, the populace Outside, the grinning devil and vile beast, Who sets his paw-mark on the simpleton Living for this world's praise.âI'm altering, My Leofric; Zaccheus from the fig Came down at summons and restored his gain, Ill-gotten, to the poor. I will provide Good hospitable lodging for the Lord, And you shall furnish it with ornament. Leofric. There is no joy ... oh, my lips fail like tools Blunt-edged; I cannot carve the words I would. This sudden surety of a noble toil, Not unimmortal like the labourer's, Good as the earth to the Creator's eyes, And excellent as nature unto man, Is better to me than a promised wealth, More even than a marriage. Flambard. [looking at Leofric] Ah, to say Let there be summer in a human face, And straightway there is summer, gives a man, In sooth, an inkling of omnipotence Not to be scorned. Here comes a malcontent. [Enter Wilfrith.] I ever shunned such; you may deal with him; Cheer him with my departure. Leofric! [Aside.] He's lost. How happy are these artistsâwell! [Exit. Leofric. A minster-church, a pile to block the air, And throw steep shadows on the tiny roofs; It's built now. I behold it. Wilfrith. Leofric, I had a dream, a cruel, ghastly dream, An apparition. I must see the king. Leofric. What ails you? Wilfrith. God will bring deliverance, And yet by fearful means. The instrument ... But what has happened? You have surely seen A comfortable vision, for your eyes Look as they never more could shed salt tears. Give me your message. Leofric. Wilfrith, you are scared. Listen, good uncle Godric is restored, And dear routine will give you back the health That days uneven agitate. Wilfrith. The kingâ You do not seem to careâdeliverance; We shall be free. Leofric. The devil gave you dreams, And in imagination you are bond. What want you with the king? At Malwood Lodge He earns his daily feast of venison. Let be, and listen to my saner news: Flambard is Durham's bishop, and I go To buildâ Wilfrith. What boots it I am hounded on Of fiends? I cannot tell what it portends, I am distracted; but you have your artâ It's nothing to you. Leofric. Wilfrith, it is less To be possessed of devils that are dumb, Than dwell the mate of undelivered power, A stricken thing divine, another self, Kingly and crippled as great David's son. Wilfrith. All that is fantasy; these fearful dreams Are real. Yet, if England in his death Gain freedomâ Leofric. It's the spirit that is free. Wilfrith, you cannot know, when first I took These logs of wood and stared at them, it was As God Himself lay captive at my heart, And I must burst His withes and worship Him, His jailer, who could give Him prison-bread, Not liberty. I perished in His chains: I could not speak;ânow He has utterance, And all my nature subjugate to joy Of His authority, I am at peace. You have religion; let it make you bold To bear the strange convulsions of the world. Be happy in your consecrated thoughts; Look on the church; in its vicinity You shall spend blameless years, till 'neath its stones You sleep in death's immured tranquillity. Wilfrith. No, no. I'll to the king to save his soul. [Exit. Leofric. And I'll to Durham to my lattice-work. [Exit. Scene III. âCastle Malwood. The King's Chamber. Rufus [starting from sleep]. Maria! Light! Help, help! [Enter Chamberlains.] 1st Chamberlain. A fearful cry! My lord, what is 't? 2nd Chamberlain. His eyes like shooting-stars Blaze all about. 1st Chamberlain. And dew is on his brow. Speak, speak! My lord! Rufus. Bring me the candle, closeâ Near, near! 1st Chamberlain. 'Twill fire the bed. Rufus. There hangs my cloakâ My hunting horn. And who are ye, black louts? Those yonder are my boots? I must have dreamt; Nearer, the light!âthe comfortable light, The earthly light, the light that shows me life. And who are you? 2nd Chamberlain. Your faithful chamberlains. Rufus. Show me your faces; they are dim and red.â My dreams are bloody.âHa! your pimpled nose And your slant eye-lid, I have known them ere I went to sleep. You are my chamberlains, My common servants, born as other men, And subject to like terrors with myself; So do not leave me. Sit on either side, And watch my pillow. Varlets, if you stir Your haunches from each side of me, the day Shall never dawn for either. 1st Chamberlain. We will stay. Rufus. Hath the cock crowed? Ay! now his throat's at work. You'll never hear that when your blood is shed; 'Tis of the earth and waking to the sun; There is no clarion of judgment in 't. 1st Chamberlain. A pleasant household noise! The day is near; She's melting the cold east. 2nd Chamberlain. And shadows wane How fares my liege? Rufus. It was a sleep diseased. I'm well.âThis heart is full, and yet they drew Medicinal red drops; they bled me, andâ Snuff the light, villains! Do you see, 'tis dull, And ruddily the flame's obscured! Now sitâ For as they bled me, lo! my blood gushed up To Heaven and put out the light of day.â Maria! 2nd Chamberlain. O my lord!âhe calls again. There is damnation in his face. Rufus. Look, look! Out through the window is my blood, it glows Across the sky, incarnadines the clouds, And there is day behind it. Red, red, red! Gules! Oh, blood-red! 1st Chamberlain. It is the sunrise. Rufus. No!â Is my heart rushing out? 2nd Chamberlain. My lord, my lord! Thus daylight comes. You've heard of rosy morn? 'Tis here. Indeed, the colour of the sun Envermeils all the east. Rufus. Not mine, not mine? It renders me my dream. 1st Chamberlain. Yea, like the sun You'll lift on high the scarlet of your reign, That it will clothe the Heavens with its pride And quite outdo yon PhÅbus. 2nd Chamberlain. So I think. Such my interpretation of your dream. Rufus. Ha, ha! you teach me reason. From my heart The ruby stream of empire shall expand Until it dyes the vision of the world With glory yet beyond.âI'll raise myself. Ah! now I see the tree-tops, dingy, dun, With just a spot of foliage down there That's lurid with high blush from off the sky. It's earth, familiar outlook, just the wood Where I shall hunt to-day; I'll lie and rest; I have a heavy head-ache. Who comes here? Hamon! [Enter Robert Fitz-hamon.] Fitz-hamon. Good day. You have a haggard look; I fear that sleep hath been unmerciful, As all soft wantons can be. Rufus. I have dreamt, Have been appalled and shaken by a spark, Until I called it doomsday. Fitz-hamon. Very strange. Dreams multiply. Did aught of death invade Your slumbers? Rufus. Ay, such hovered through the fog Like Jack-o'-lantern. But these cunning knaves (As nimble Joseph cheered the Court of Nile) Make me a merry prophet. Fitz-hamon. Pray you, keep From hunting in the forest. There's a load This morning on my spirits. Rufus. It is hot; And August weather makes a fool of you. [Enter the Ãtheling Henry.] Well, Harry, shall we hunt? Ãtheling Henry. So please you, yes. Fitz-hamon. I pray him notâfor portents are about, And I have waked uneasy. Ãtheling Henry. Do not, then. If CrÅsus had attended to his dream (The golden king of Lydia), he ne'er Had lost his son, the hunter, from the dart Of the young man's own friend. Rufus. Now none of that, Your clerkly nonsense, Harry. Ay, we'll hunt, But after meat. The fore-noon we'll devote To business, for I plan a march to Rome. I'll go where Anselm journeysânot with scrip, But ringing shield, no staff, but ready spear. Bring me cold waterâI must freeze my head To have it cool for projects! 'Tis full day. Harry, the sun is after you, I'll swear You stand a man of gold.âGet out, I'll dress. [Exeunt. Scene IV. âCastle Malwood. The Banqueting-hall. Enter Servants with dishes. 1st Servant. The feast is ready. Flagons glow with wine Hotter than summer's veins. 2nd Servant. The steam of joints Is dense across the breath of basking noon. The feasters come. 3rd Servant. Hast noted how the king Falls into silence after each brave speech, And is so noisy certain that he'll hunt Before the day is out? 1st Servant. Yet puts it off, And plunges into business recklessly. 2nd Servant. The chamberlains at cock-crow heard him call The Holy Name. 1st Servant. I'll swear he never did; He scoffs at all religion. 2nd Servant. Ay, my son, A mocker is a mendicant at pinch. [Enter the King, the Ãtheling Henry, Walter Tirel, Robert Fitz-hamon, William of Breteuil, and others.] Rufus. A goodly meal, A fat repast. Be seated, gentlemen. My hearty Tirel, lean you to my right, I'll have you served with primest venison; For, gentlemenâbe patient with my freak, It is not worth your jealousy, good ladsâ I'm smitten with this Tirel, and my love Must have him near, at meat and in the chase. For ere the sun is slanting through the glades, And taming with its soft decline the brutes That range these woods, we'll huntâ Tirel. We will, we will! I'll bring to earth rich quarry. Rufus. So thou shalt.â I wish I did not love thee.â[To Attendants.] Serve him well. Drink, pot-companions, to my sovereignty. I'll hold my court at Poitiers next Yule. The Hall I've built at Westminster is nought,â A pigmy temple for my empire's shrine. Drink, compeers, to our revels in the south, Where Christmas shall be hot as is to-day. A rouse! Lift up thy cup, thou fool of France. Ãtheling Henry. Is Walter tame with this blank airless noon, Or will he flash retort? Tirel. Talk, talk, all talk! The way is clear. Breton and Angevin Bow to his sway, and yet he nothing does But wag his forward tongue. Rufus. Ho! saucy mate! We'll be across the Alps and back again Before our belfries ring the old year out. Tirel. If ever they submit to English rule, An evil death may every Frenchman die! Ãtheling Henry. A patriot! He's flame and vinegar. Drink to our merry sport. These beechen glades And golden mossy plots, where shadows lie Asleep like satyrs, will be exquisite In mellow warmth of sun-down ere we start. Fitz-hamon [to the King]. You still incline to hunting? Rufus. Hunt I will. My brain is dull and clotted with affairs; The evening will be cool. Tirel. Oh, very cold. Rufus. Why say you so? Tirel. Sooth, as a flatterer I magnify your language, for you prate Like a big tyrant. You say coolâI, cold. Rufus. My bosom-friend! [Enter Wilfrith.] Breteuil. Who's here? A staring monk, With sooty rings about his fevered eyes? Wilfrith. Where is the king? Breteuil. He crowns the feast up there. Rufus. More venison, you niggards! Wine, I say! I will not hunt till I am full of meat, And jocund with the madding blood of grapes. Pour! serve!âI pledge you, Walter. Tirel. In red wine I challenge you. Breteuil. This monk has had a dream. Rufus [aside]. Cursed be these visions and these haunting sights That fool my health to qualms. Let's hear this trance. We have no jester at the feast to-day. We will make merry with this cowled buffoon. Wilfrith [to the King]. Hither, my lord, I've travelled through the sun To reach your living feet and hold them back From the dark threshold of your coming doom. I saw the throne of Judgment, and the night Flared to annihilation, while the beams Of moonlight gathered round a kneeling form, A woman, lily-vestured, sad and white, The Church that grieved most sorely to her Lord. I looked and saw a coal-black figure rise, With grizzly raiment, scintillating dartsâ A man, the swarthy witness to his forge. One shaft the mystic Hand omnipotent Took, turned, and pointed earthwards.âOh, my lord, The bow is bent. Rufus. Ho, ho! He is a monk. Monk-like, he dreams for money. Give him coinsâ A hundred shillings. Wilfrith. O my lord, my lord ... I will not take a penny for my pains. Only believe my words. Oh, look not on me with hot merry face That Death may strike to stone and kill with cold At any wretched moment. [Enter a Smith.] Heaven! Christ! 'Tis heâthe sable minister. Good Lord, Have mercy!âfor the darts are in his hand, And death becomes reality. Dark man, Did you not walk along God's hall last night? Smith. The monk is crazed. I am an honest soul Who wrought last night these arrows for the king. He makes me fear that I am marked to die. Wilfrith. Not you. Rufus [to Smith]. Approach. How many dost thou bring? Smith. Six, my good lord. Rufus. They are not for the bow, You mean them for the deadly arbalest. They're finely wrought, most cunning Master Smith. Four I will keep; and two I'll give to thee, My Walter, for 'tis meet that sharpest steel Be gift to him who dealeth deadly strokes. [To Smith.] My thanks, and praise. Wilfrith. There is a further doom. The murky hands are empty. All is vain. Woe, woe! [Enter a Messenger.] Ãtheling Henry. Your news? Messenger. A letter, gracious king, From Abbot Serlo. Rufus. Harry, read the scrawl. What says it? Ãtheling Henry. That another monk hath dreamed Such things as this. [Pointing to Wilfrith. Rufus. Is every brain a cave Of silly visions? So the Church complains Among the clouds as well as on the earth. Walt, do thou justice, even with the things Which thou hast heard. Tirel. I will. Ha, ha! I will. Rufus. I wonder at Lord Serlo's fantasy,â A good old abbot, but a simple soul,â When I am torn with business and great cares, To send this nonsense of his snoring monks. What! Am I like the English, who are scared From deed and office of necessity By any whining crone who nods her head? Ãtheling Henry. The sun declines, and still you linger on. Tirel. You are afraid. Ãtheling Henry. Fie! fie! I think you are, You have such craven hold upon your chair. By Jupiter, I swear you will not hunt; But break your promise to the forest-ways To make them rich with sport. Tirel [aside]. He drinks again, As if he'd weary Time from tempting him With what he fears to act. [Aloud.] A coward! Ay, Thy liver blanches, though thy cheek's afume. Fie, thou art fearful of the bunchÃ¨d trees, And the deer startle thee. Rufus. I'll hunt, I say. But I am sick and sad a hundred-fold, More than ye wot. The end is comeâI mean The feast is over! Rise. I do not think I stuck more closely to my mother's teat Than to this table. Nay, I will not go. Tirel. He's mocking! Rufus. It's a heavy air. ... The dogs Are baying with a pleasant vulgar sound That shames my inner strangeness. Seat, farewell! I feel as I should fall!âAll's right. We'll go. [Exeunt. Scene V. âThe New Forest: a Glade. Enter the Ãtheling Henry, William of Breteuil, and Gilbert of Clare. Ãtheling Henry. We're solitary. Clare. Ay, these tangled brakes Confuse companionship. Ãtheling Henry. Their giddy boughs, Like sirens' hair, enwind the charmÃ¨d sense Until it lose its function. Let us on. Breteuil. We have encountered little sport. Ãtheling Henry. Rich chance Wait on our sundered friends, for we to-day Are not Diana's favourites. Clare. Methinks I hear across the air the chime of dogs Rejoicing the green distance. Breteuil. I hear nought. Ãtheling Henry. There leaps a squirrel! 'Tis too small a goal For arrow's flight. Contemptuous is Fate To send us such small prey. Beat down the fern! I caught the glimmer of a couchant side Gold in the evening beam. A deer! To chase. [Exeunt. [Enter from the other side, Robert Fitz-hamon and Gilbert of Laigle.] Fitz-hamon. Where is the king? Laigle. I cannot even guess. I saw him turn about a clump of oak In company with Tirel; when I reached The spreading corner he was gone. Fitz-hamon. The pack Is just below. But we are in a maze, And there's no thread to guide us. I will blow My horn. Laigle. Stay! Yonder is a grazing herd, Soft victims for our onslaught.âWhere the dell Stoops to a stony brook, I hear response. We have not far to seek. Fitz-hamon. Within a wood We're far and near; perchance may never meet. Laigle. We'll work to share our favours with the rest, And call the dogs around us. In this shade The air is cloistered. It is very hot. [Exeunt. Scene VI. âAnother part of the Forest: a Glade below Malwood. Enter the King and Walter Tirel. Rufus. Tirel, I am a man again; these leaves Breathe life; the rattle of the quiver shakes My heart to palpitation and sharp joy. This freedom makes each throbbing art'ry bold, And clears my blood of phantasy. I stand The jolly hunter, with my steadfast bow, And bosom unconfined with secret thoughts That girdled my good spirits to this hour And kept them tight at dinner. Tirel. You were sad. But who could help rejoicing, that is lord Of these deep forests! Rufus. Every inch of ground Is mine; yon wide-set beeches, mine; the deer All mine, my father's heritage. Like him I love themâto the death. One comes. Soft! soft! I'm readyânow! [Shoots, and slightly wounds the deer. Tirel. It runs. Rufus. The light is broad; It blinds me. Tirel. 'Tis the setting of the sun. Rufus. I'll shade my eyes.âHe's there! Tirel. See, see, my lord! Another one! Rufus. Shoot, in the devil's name! [Tirel shootsâthe arrow glances from an oak, and pierces the King. Tirel. God save me! He is falling on the dart. It breaks; he grasps the fragment with a groan And pulls out death from hiding in his breast. Christ! He hath found his doom. Wretch, wretch am I! [Coming up to the King.] For mercy's sake, lift up thy face! The lips Are speechless; but there's vision in the eyesâ Their egress nearly dumbâand yet they say: âPain is my portion; all is lost.â I'll seize These flow'rs and herbs; perchance the Lord above Will hold them for a sacrament. He's gone. Too late! He's clay, and lifeless. I could thinkâ He looks so stout and proof against his fallâ He'd rise again, and bend once more his bow, Bend it to slay his murderer. I'll fly. They'd call it murder though I did it not. The tree, the oak, was Nimrod in this chase, And mightily hath hunted.âI am chilled; There is a wind as if the woods breathed free. ... There is a terror round me and this man, A gathering of voices through the shades, A vengeful trooping of screened witnesses, A judge's tension in the very air, As it would aim a sentence 'gainst my soul. God! I must fly. If I escape with life, To Holy Land I'll bear my ransomed blood.â Cold image of dead fellowship, good-bye!â I dare not pause; so fearful is the spot. To horse! [Exit. [Enter on the other side Robert Fitz-hamon and Gilbert of Laigle.] Laigle. Ho, ho! We shall not meet this eve. There's Friar's lantern unseen in the wood, Or we should never wander thus like fools. The sun is down; dew falls and shadows grow. Fitz-hamon. What's thatâyon heap with glitter on the grass? Some hunter sorely hurt.âAlas!âthe king! And dead as what he lies on. Ah, too true The visions swelled around the banks of sleep; He would not see the warning. Now he lies In dreamless slumbers that will never wake Till every night is done. Laigle. Alas! alas! His hands were full of gifts. [Enter William of Breteuil and Gilbert of Clare.] Look here and see Our fortune dead! Clare. The king! Breteuil. Lift up his bulk. Fitz-hamon. Too late. The dart hath scattered all his breath, And we are ruined. Breteuil. Let us to our holds And gather booty in! Clare. Whose deed is this? Fitz-hamon. Some churl's offence. Laigle. 'Twas Tirel rode with him. Breteuil. Tirel I saw at gallop even now, As if the fiend were hindmost. Clare. Curse the fool! We'll follow to revenge this regicide. Off, off, and after! [Exeunt Clare and Laigle. Breteuil. Nobles of the land, This is a pause of moment in affairs. You all declare for Robert. I'll away And seize the hoard at Winchester. [Exit. [Enter the Ãtheling Henry.] Ãtheling Henry. Well met. I've had my bow-string mended where a dame, As brown as Earth, was full of prophecyâ Jove! What is this? Fitz-hamon. Your royal brother dead. Ãtheling Henry. Who knows? Fitz-hamon. Some three. De Breteuil's on his way To Winchester. Ãtheling Henry. I am your kingâHe's gone. [Fitz-hamon rides off. The king that is, left with the king that was, Both the crowned fruit of one imperial womb. William, I'll be a wiser prince than thou, And yet as proud.âMy coming fate must have The heels of Atalanta.âEnglish oaks, Farewell; ye've crowned the Ãtheling. Now I'll race To Winchester, where all the gold is bright. [Exit. [Enter Purkis and Beowulf.] Purkis. A sunny eve. I'll prop you 'neath this trunk You know the girth of, while I gather clods For the oven.âHow his face works! Does he smell The hunters here about? There is no sound. [At a little distance he perceives the body of Rufus. Beowulf. What do you stand so still for? Purkis. Farther off! [Kneeling before Rufus, and speaking low.] The very crown of England in the dust; Those royal eyes sunk in the savageness Of death! My kingâwhat, no retainer here? They say thy father lay upon the floor:â That was in Normandy. We Englishmen Have awe. Well, well,âa freeman and no churl Shall bear you to your burial. All soaked With bloodâthe very Earth! A majesty Is on him, and my heart's allegiance Is his. 'Tis pity that he broke with God. Such quarrels have one ending. I will kneel, And humbly as the meekest chamberlain Put thee to rest, and kiss and fold thy hands Cross-wise,âthe posture's good for judgment-morn, It turns the Lord's eye off to Calvary To come back moist with mercy.âHow to lift? Dad can't assist. Beowulf. I will have charge of him; Give him to me. It was the oak that struck; He wounded it; it gathered up the wrongs Of generations in its storied pile, And for the people hath poured out revenge. The Earth shall leper him; each trampled blade Of grass shall bear a drop of blood for dew; Nature shall part the spoil; the gallows fowl Must not be left unsummoned, the maimed dogs Must mutilate the quarry. Purkis. Father, hush! Satan has hold of you; you would not curse A murdered man. I'll fetch the cart to bear His bones to Winchester; he must be laid 'Mid the old royal tombs. Beowulf. Is he not damned? Purkis. We are poor folk, and he has rated us. God 's king; He'll have a fellow-feeling like; No vengeance in His heart. Leave Him to judge. Beowulf. Yea, bear him through the woods like a gashed boar, Present him dripping to your angry God; He may not be implacable. In haste Cloak the foul thing beneath the minster tow'r; Heap soil on him; choke your rememberance Of his unnat'ral crime; establish him In the untaxed dominion of a grave;â Earth will unhouse him from his tenement; He shall be dispossessed. The crumbling tow'r Shall spread in ruins over him: his vault Shall crack her walls, and open up her roof To let foul, rushing weather on the clay That shall rot down with refuse and be lost, The land-mark broken down, the boundary And guarding hallowed precinct of a tomb. Purkis [aside]. La! he is terrible. I cannot doubt He's some great advocate to press his wrongs. It's odd now I should tremble to entrust A dead man to the keeping of a blind. Great king, you're in the clutch of Destiny! Death looks a strong-ceiled house; ah me! I fear It is a sorry sanctuary from sin. There's much remains. Some hoary influence Sits at the chimney-corner of our lives, Holding a rightful end in store for all. There's little we can alter. All the same It's simple we must give him burial. I'll fetch the cart with Wilfrith. [Exit. Beowulf [carefully feeling the corpse]. There are worms About his darkness. I am satisfied. [Leaving the body, he props himself against the oak. Earth, Earth, O Earth! the tyrant is struck down. Thou drew'st the arrow from Fate's sluggish hand; Thou sped'st it mortally. Though thy blind sons Dishonour thee, seeking the younger love Of Country, swayed by her caprice, to strive For law or liberty, while thou art bond, Far off thou hearest Freedom's yeanling cry, Orphaned, necessitous; thy motherhood, O Earth, is prophecy! Thou wilt prevail.</field>
