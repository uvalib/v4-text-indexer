Ralph, Son to Cecil. George, Son to Cecil. Jasper, a Country Hind. Cubbin, Son to Jasper. Church Warden, &amp;c. Caroline Cecil, only Daughter to Lord Cecil. Esther, her Nurse and Tutress. Kate, Wife to Jasper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT FIRST. SCENE I. A Room. CarolineâTo her enter Esther. Est. Hah! what's th'ado to-day, that I am teazed And call'd thus early from my grateful rest? Where sits the wind o'th'morning? Have you read The beagle of the air, and noted me Where points his nose, and bends his golden eye? Car. Still at thy old conceits!âthough now I should Be right well versant in quaint similies, I know not what you mean. What must I read? Est. O what a slow-paced intellect!âIf thou Had'st been as apt in mental energies, And the fine semblances that fancy draws, As thou art in thy pleasures, thou had'st been A very phÅnix, CarolineâWhat read! Go read the vane, dame Light-head, read the vaneâ Dost understand me now? and note thou well The very point to a hairs-breadth which his comb Patiently points at. Car. Pray out with it, Esther; Or troth your jest will hang so long i'th'wind 'Twill lose its relishâWhat imports the vane, Or from what point the breeze o'the morning blows? Est. Much it imports to thee, and all the fair Fond fluttering things that sigh beneath the load Of maiden fears, tremors, and jealousies. 'Tis to the very home of love he points. For, trust me, whencesoe'er the wind o'ernight Has blown on thee, it has been from the land Where love holds revelry, and keeps his wake Mid thorns and rosesâNay, his very breath Hath fann'd thy cheek and flush'd it to a glow. Thy humid lip, the lustre of thine eyeâ That living lustre from the soul that flows, And turns the dews of heaven to sprinkled dust, All blab the burning secret ere thy tongue Has power to utter it. Car. Thou guessest shrewdly! Est. Ah, my Caroline! Nor precept nor example will thee stay From rushing headlong on those flowery toils; But thou may'st vainly struggle to get free Once thou art meshed. Car. Thou art so pleasant, Esther, And yet so kind withal, thy accents seem The very soul's own elixirâI'm indeed Love's bondmaidâyea, his very slave I am; And for his sake have done a deed whichâ Est. Caroline!âWhat hast thou done? If thou hast done the veriest trifling levity, Or given up even the least proportion Of aught distinguishable that becomes Thy maiden honour, name, and noble lineage, Give it not utterance, but let me slumber In happy ignorance, or hopeful doubt. Car. Done?âWhat have I done! Ah, Esther, Although the time's not long, since I last saw you Love has done much, but not the thousandth part Which he has yet to do!âO, I look onwards To such long years of blissâof generous rapture, So pure and unalloy'd, that every sense Seems framed to feelings all sublimed and new! You say, if I have given up aught unmeetâ Sooth, Esther, I have given up all that love Can give or askâfor I have given myselfâ I'm wedded. Est. May the great God of Heaven forefend! Car. Esther!âWhat mean'st thou? Say not so again. Est. Did I hear rightly?âSaid'st thou wedded? Car. As truly and as solemnly as union On earth was ever seal'd. Est. The die's then cast! O rash, rash, frantic girl, what hast thou done? Thou'st struck me to the heart! Car. Pray do not plain, nor grieve thyself and me, For now 'tis past and cannot be undone. I dreaded to apprize thee, for I knew Thy anxious fear of all that me concerns; But now I know thou wilt conform thy love And care to my most nice and perilous state. Est. Yes, thou wert predetermined, and durst not Trust my remonstrancesâthou wert resolved To have thy loverâAh! the prospect chills me! It will notânay, it cannot come to good. Car. 'Tis doneâ'Tis doneâBe that your first regardâ Your comments afterâWhy look you so sad? 'Tis done, I say, and I exult in it. Would that my case had been a thousand times More critical. Then had I manifested Some shadow of the love I bear my husband. My husband! that's a new and thrilling term! O, my old Esther, if you knew the half Of that high love I feel for him, you would not Thus blame me. Est. Ah, too generous Caroline! Thou art all love and easy tenderness; But, O fond girl, thou hast done far amiss! I scarce know what I dread, but the impression That thy discovery on my mind has made Is so mishapen and repulsive all, That I am sure of woeful consequence. Our day of bliss is past! Car. (weeping.) I see you do not love me; There is but one in all my father's house That I dare trust, and she upbraids and blames me. It is not well. Est. The hate, the deadly feud Between your sires, can never be cancell'd. No, all the world will never reconcile The haughty Cecil to Sir Anthony. O I am sick at heart!âPardon me, love; Indeed, I'd not have seen you wed another, Nor for a nobler husband wish'd, for I Hold Moore unequall'dâ Car. Is he not, Esther?âHa! Say, is he not unequall'd?âO that was A word that my ear loved!âSay it again. Say't often, Esther, for indeed there is No detriment of truth in'tâIf I wist That ever women loved with half the love I bear Sir Anthony, I would take blame For that I've done; but all the love e'er sway'd The female soul must come far short of mine! O had I more to give, and more to risk! And more!âand more!âI've read of dames who wept, And pined, and some who died too for their lords; But I hold light of these, for I would do them All every day for brave Sir Anthony. Speak sometimes of him to me, Esther, And O let it be kindlyâSpeak his worth, And then my ears shall drink the welcome sounds, And hang upon them with such grateful pause, As pilgrim on the distant melody, That wanders from his long and far-sought shrine. Est. Think'st thou he will prove true? Car. Ah! can you ask That with a serious eye? Please you refrain From such insulting question. Est. He's noted for a fickle changeful mind. Car. But not in love!âO no! they know him not That would insinuate such sickly stuff. Est. You're crazed with love, poor girl, most wofully; But I'll be plain with youâWith all his bravery, Honour, and virtue, still he somewhat lacks To make him greatâHe's easy in th'extreme, And credulous as a childâhe's rather one To cast a sudden and a dazzling beam, Than to sit burning with a steady light I'll lecture you on this. Car. Pray not just now, Or if you lecture, let it be on love. Est. It shallâbut list, thy brothers are astir. Come to my chamber, for thou hast much need Of a sound lessonâI will show thee truly What love isâand what thou art. My sweet Cecil!â Pride of the land! what art thou More than a tender flower of form and hue Too delicate and lovely to maintain It's blossom all unsullied? 'Tis a world Where every blight hankers round purity! The dust may fall upon the hyacinth, The sullied eves-drop on the wall-flower crust, The stain may fester on the violet, Yet none of these be mark'dâthey blossom on. But when such light upon the lily's breast, Or the soft foldings of the virgin rose, By every eye the blemish is beheld, And that aloneâThou art such flower, Which suns have warm'd, and southern breezes fann'd, Till all the glowing tints of nature burn Both in thy mind and mein. O, my loved child! I fear the blossoms of the virgin gem Are fallen and blighted in untimely day!â Come with me, my love-blinded Caroline. SCENE II. Benendine Castle. Moore and Collier meeting. Moore. Welcome, my gallant friend, Sir Richard Collier, I joy once more to greet you here at Benendine. What news from Cumberland?âIn one word, say How our rash sortance there gives countenance, For I am all impatience. Col. All well, my lord; And to your timeous aid, and most prompt measures, The land its safety owes. Moore. Have you already rid the west of all The Scots that did infest it? Col. Some are gone home to keep their Lent, Sir Anthonyâ But more remain in Cumberland. Moore. Remain!âHow?âWhere? Why have you left the army then?âBy heaven, Had I been there, I'd not have left a man! No, not a weather-beaten bare-kneed thief, Should have turn'd up his brown and moor-burnt visage, Or cock'd his bonnet to an Englishman. Col. Patience, good knightârestrain your indignation. Those that remain in Cumberland will not Do much mischief. Moore. Ha? What? Col. One half remain, 'tis trueâ Moore. Remainâ Col. (Stopping him.) But there is not A Scot on this side Solway unsecured In gaol or cemetery. Moore. Ha, ha, ha!âPardon me, Collier.â Give me thy hand, brave knight. Where is our friend, the gallant Faucet? Col. I left him on the Border, actively Viewing the forts, and doubling every post At ford and causeway. In this business he Has done most noble service. Moore. I know no knight On English ground that may compare with Faucet. Col. He overcame and slew the bloody Gordon With his own hand. He will be here anon. Moore. I'm sick till then. Myself have cleared the Tyne, And forced the mighty Liddesdale to seek For shelter in his fens and pathless woods. I'll warn the king of our unween'd success, For he is hasting north with all his power. Give me description of these Galloway warriors; 'Tis said they lack the honour, and the might Of the staunch Scottish borderer, but that They fight with hellish ire. Col. Yes, when they're hungry they will fight for food; And when driven desperate they will fight for life,â Most sternly will they fight! but as for honour, That's from the questionâa most rare conjunction. O, such a set of raggamuffin thieves These eyes did never look onâBy my troth, 'Tis a rare thought, honour in Galloway! Moore. (Laughing.) Forgive me, Collier, for I needs must laugh At you and these your western warriors. Col. Nay, by the Lord, Sir Anthony, when I First saw the dogs approaching rank and file I laugh'd outright, they looked so rascally. And yet I felt a chillness at the sight Of human creatures so unflesh'd and gnarl'd. Seeing their kilted hams and matted locks, Red-crested flap-caps, brows, and long peel'd jaws, I deempt them beings of some horrid nature, Who feasted on old sinewy goats and serpents, And drank distilled mustard.âI did laugh, But thought not once of honour! By my knighthood, Had thought of Galloway and Honour cross'd me, I had o'erlaugh'd the battle. Moore. Out on thee, knight, This is too much. (Laughing.) Farewell a while. I'm bound To secret meeting, which I yearn and pine for. (Aside.) (Why should I not acquaint my brother knights With that concerns me most? Certes I will.â Sir Richard, knowest thou young Caroline, The pride of all the Cecils? Col. Full well, my lord. Moore. She is mine, My own true wedded spouse, whom I love more Than all this world beside. Col. I give you joy with all my heart and soul,â She's a most rare and precious jewel. Moore. 'Tis yet a secretâgive't no breath, unless To our beloved Faucet.âFare thee well. (Exit Moore.) Col. Married to Caroline!âAllied to Cecil! I little wot how this will suit the growth Of our yet thriving scheme of mastership. It is a moteâa most unseemly speck In our fair prospect!âWould it were to do! It should not be consummate else than by Surmounting high obstruction.âBut 'tis done, And I must wish it thrive, for I do love him With my whole heart. Enter Faucet. Ha! brother captain, do I see you here, And that so early? Fau. I've posted all the way; For that fierce earl, redoubted Liddesdale, Is but retired to come again more dreadful. The Merse and Tiviotdale are up in arms, And all the dalesmen of the western border; And from the shelter'd glades, and castled steeps Of that impervious forest, where the Scotts Hold ample sway, a thousand warriors come, Whom fame reports as scarce controllable. I fear we earn but sere and scanty laurels From such staunch troopers.âWhere is Moore? Col. Gone on a fond and foolish expedition. O, Faucet, our high branching honours must Soon be cut short and dodder'd to the trunk. Fau. How dost thou mean?âI swear it shall not be, Ere thou go'st farther.âWe're in such a way That honours must accumulate and flow Upon us still; the current now is such I scarcely hold it changeable by man. Col. Sir Anthony, the very soul and stem Of our o'erwhelming influence and power, Guess what the fool hath done? Fau. I know notâspeak, for thou amazest me. Col. Espoused fair Caroline Cecil. Fau. Collier!âDost thou not jest? Col. Sooth, not a jot. I tell you they are wedded; and his love Seems past definement; all his feelings else Are swallowed up in that. Fau. O fool! fool! Most incongruous fool! Damn his precipitance!âIf I had ween'd Aught of such paralizing gross effect, I had roused earth and hell in mix'd array Against such fatal and abhorr'd conjunction. Col. If reconcilement 'twixt their houses should From this ensue, thenâ Fau. If!âLet me not hear your ifs, We'll have no ifs in such a case as this. Collier, dost thou not see all we have done And brought to bear with so much patient labour, At peril of our honours and our lives, Is by this vile collusion frustrated And levell'd?âscatter'd to the winds at once? Col. Certes 'tis most unmeet? Fau. 'Tis we have given this Moore the precedence, Unknown even to himself; and now I tell thee, If ever my name be syllabled between Their houses in adjustment, all is lost. And our deep pioneering policy will Flash on the day at once.âIt must not holdâ No, and it shall not holdâthis cursed cement. Men must not fall, and houses must not sink, That women may be kiss'd. Col. Nought can be done. He's now at Exeter to visit her, In guise most secret, which besteads him well. Fau. But he shall ne'er go backâNo, neverâ This is the last time he must e'er behold That witching polish'd play-thing. Col. Thy threat's unmeet; Nought shalt thou do against our noble friend. Fau. Nought do!âI'll dizzy them!âHell, but I will! Yes, all this golden palace of delight I'll countermine, and sapping its vile base, Set it coranting on the eddying air Till all its corbells and dight garniture Sink shatter'd in the mud.â Nought do!âI'll pluck the heart away From this voluptuous and rank-feeding passion, And give it to corruption, till it greet The sicken'd sense with loathing.âSee thou to it; For if thou flinch, thou art the first that fall'st.â I'll do it, or dishonour blast my name! SCENE III. A Hall in a Castle. Cecil, George. Cecil. Come hither, boy.âSee'st thou this charge that bears The royal seal and signature? Geo. I do: Pray what imports it? Cecil. Imports it, son! Thou art a fallen, ruin'd, abject slave, A vagrant on the earth's lean commonage; Doom'd haply to manure or delve the soil Thy father call'd his own.âSave this old heritage, Our broad domains, our honours, and commands, Are all bestow'd upon that varlet Moore, That mean, that drivelling, undermining wretch! I am outwitted, duped, and sore beset.â But ere I'll stoop to bow the neck to him And his old dotard sire, I'll brave the worst That kings, mean parasites, or fiends, can muster. I'll not be gallow'd by a royal thief, With all his axes and his scaffoldings, From most consummate vengeance.âNote me, son: Small are the bounties I can now bestow; But go, proclaim it 'mongst my followers, I'll give my daughter, my loved Caroline, With half of those poor lands I yet call mine, To any one, the meanest of them all, That will bring me the heart of that damn'd cozener,â That Anthony Moore. Geo. The heart of Anthony Moore!â Oh, honour'd fatherâ Cecil. His heart, I say!âOther equivalent I'll none ofâI'll not take head, hand, limb, Nor any superficeâI'll have his heart!â I'll have his heart!â Enter Ralph. Avaunt, thou dull intruder. How darest thou rush upon my privacy, Thus madly staring, without ceremony? What is't alarms thee now? Ralph. O, honour'd sire, Here do we stand in momentary peril. Some hellish plot has crept within our walls And there finds fosterage; for, by this light, I saw young Moore, the heir of Benendine, Our most avow'd and mortal enemy, Steal from our porch in deep disguise, and fly Like thief across the field. Cecil. Hah! He within my walls, and 'scape with life! Out on thee, craven!âTo your arms!âHolloa!â Get me a steedâLet all the bloodhounds looseâ Ye're traitors all!âSpeed the pursuit, I say. Ralph. My lord, pursuit is vain; before this time He's past the bounds of Exeter, and safe. Cecil. Ay, ay, I ween'd soâIt is always thus. Each one of you combine to thrall your father,â To mortify and wound him.âIt is well!â It seems as if the fiends of darkness were Let loose, and did combine with God and man To wrack and crush the old grey-headed Cecil.â He'll brave them all!âWill he not do it?âYes. He braves them all!âUgh!âDo all your worst! Geo. O patience, my loved father. Cecil. Canting driveller! Thy soul was motion'd for some crazed monk That reads dry homiliesâTalk to me of patience! Who late held king and country at my nod, And now am caged and trampled on by dogs. Go call up all my slavesâI'll search their souls, And learn who's in connivance with this Moore. Ralph. That thou hast need to do. I'll bring them all. (Exit Ralph.) Cec. To me this stratagem's inexplicable. 'Tis for no goodâHere have I taken hold In my old patrimonial home, and must I Be ferreted from thence, and hunted down Upon the open field!âbay'd at by curs! Enter Ralph, with Male and Female Servants. George, seek the blockmanâSee that he be nigh, Hell's usher with his clinchers and his tools Yare at a carbonadoâBring the leech, His is the only antidote for treason.â Now, my right worthy liegemen, and chaste maidens; Well tried and trusty gang! Who of you have Leagued with my foe, that Moore of Benendine, Against my life?âDeclareâfor see who comes. Enter George with the Executioner. 1st Man Ser. It was nought me, my guod luord, I wote. 2d Man Ser. Nor me, plaise your guod luordship. 3d Man Ser. Nor me, &amp;c. &amp;c. 1st Maid Ser. (Coming forward curtseying.) Believe me, my good lord, it wes not I. Cecil. (Enraged, mimicking.) âAh! wes it not, good madam? None more likeâNo one more like Than such as you to league with such a flasher. (Growls.) Ugh!âGet thee gone, thou stalk of gilt corruption! Thou mouse!âthou doll!âthou babyclout!âaway Out of my sight!âSo! 'Twas not you? Nor you?âNor you?âNor you?âNo, no, 'Twas none of you!âHe of himself alone Got in and out; and with himself held converse Throughout the night.â'Tis plain 'twas none of you! âDamn'd knaves! you're guilty all, I see it in your looksâI'll have you manacled, Rack'd, and, one after one, your heads chopp'd off Till you confess your plot. Omnes Servants. (Crying aloud.) Oh!âOh what shall we do! Enter Caroline. Car. What means this rout?âMy father, thou hast been Doing somewhat in wrathâin blindfold rage, Which ever and anon thou dost amissâ Where lies the offence? Cecil. O my loved Caroline! Thou only sweetener of my lifeâwe're sold. That herd hath leagued with our insatiate foe, Cursed Moore of Benendine, to slay us all. Late was he seen among them; meanly skulking Among that scum, planning our final ruin. O, I'll have such ripe vengeance on the crew! Car. Now, on my life, 'tis wide misprision all. Are these the looks of guilt?âthese guilty things? Would I were sure of bliss as of their honesty; They have not so much mind among them all As fathom plot for robbing of a roost. Servants. What madam says is true, good measter. Car. Go, go, poor knaves. Dismiss them to their work, I stand their bail till farther proof appear. Cecil. Thou art the only one on earth, my Caroline, That I think loves me; therefore at thy suit I free them now, but they shall well be look'd to. (Exeunt Servants, who bow to Caroline, and kiss her hand or robe as they pass.) Ah, Caroline! thy heart is blameless pure. Thou feel'st thou would'st not league against thy father, Nor with his hated foes hold intercourse For nought on earth, and thou think'st all are so. Poor girl! thou little know'st the ways of men, Their craft and their deceit!âWe must beware, For this intrigue is of no trivial kind. Enter Servant, giving a letter. Ser. My lord, a henchman gave this in great haste, Then turn'd and rode as it had been for life. Cecil. This is a poor device, to turn the blame On those are innocent, and all suspicion From the real caitiffâHear what this informer, This nameless, foul impostor writes to me. (Reads.)ââMy Lord,âTo crown all the injuries you have sustained, and as a last and final indignity, young Moore of Benendine hath seduced your daughter by means of a sham marriage. While I write, he is, to my wotting, in her chamber; and, if my page's steed holds good, this may reach your hand before he quits it. The power and influence of Moore are now so rank and unpruned, I am forced to conceal my name, but am ever âA Friend to the house of Cecil.â (Long pauseâCaroline trembles and droops.) Cecil. How's this, my children?âSayâRalph, didst thou see him? Art' sure thou saw'st him steal from hence this morning? (Ralph bows; and Cecil turns his eyes slowly and fearfully round on Caroline,âthen with fury.) Ha! Dost thou tremble, girl?â No, no! It is my aching sightâ Thou dost not trembleâbut if thou dost, fly, fly, fly. No, no! I wrong thee muchâthou dost not tremble. Come near me, smile on me, and swear to me, Swear by all sacred, and last by thyself, Thou art not wed, nor sawest Moore last night. How!âWhat!âArt thou about to kneel? (Caroline kneels.) O do not kneelâpresume not, for thy soul!â Art' going to confess?âO God! O God! O God! (Raising his closed hands and eyes slowly upwards, and repressing his voice.) I braved you late, but little ween'd the pangs You had reserved for a weak proud old man! This is the last shall reach him thusâSon George, Bring me my swordâIndignity! Final indignity, the writer term'd it. 'Tis well!â'Tis consummate!â Did I kiss that polluted thing to-day?â Did I embrace her?âI have seen the time That I would shudder if I saw a toad! I erst have never seen one!âOut on't, boy! Why bring'st thou not my sword? Can'st thou not see That some of us are too long here?âA father! He that to morrow says I am a father!â Father to what?âOh! Oh! (Exit frenzied.âCaroline still kneeling, her Brothers greatly affected.âScene closes.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT SECOND. SCENE I. Benendine Castle. Moore, Faucet, Collier. Fau. I give you joy, noble Sir Anthony, Of those high honours, lands, and offices, The king hath heap'd on you. Moore. I'll none of them; Those that are wrested from the house of Cecil Shall ne'er by me be own'd. Fau. By whom then shall they? Cecil hath forfeited, and by the king Those lands to you are giftedâthey are yours; And think you Cecil will accept these lands As largess from a Moore, or hold them so? No, trust me, were he begging out the way, Want-worn and weary, you the while low kneeling, And proffering him a kingdom, he would spurn you; Ay, with his foot he'd spurn you and pass on. Moore. He is a great man fallen; and his high spirit, Unknowing how to stoop, outbears itself, And hate and rage ungovern'd on him prey. I pity him.âO he does wrong me much In weening I have wrought this dire disgrace Unto his house.â'Tis true that I have risen Over his headâupon his ruin risenâ But never by plot of mine. Fau. (Aside.) Some plotted for you, knight, And that right deeply. Moore. In spite of all the opprobrious names That he bestows on me, I love old Cecil. O there's a secret charm that binds me to him; A tie so delicate, so undefinable, I know not how to name it.âI could even kneel And clasp his knees, though he should spurn me thence. If he would smile on me, and shake my hand, And call me son, and give me son's applause, My feelings might be envied.âHave you heard Of my late venture in the realm of love, And of my goodly prize? Fau. Partly I have, but nought distinctly learn'd. Moore. Why do you not, then, give me joy on that, Dearer to me than wealth and titles are? And you too, Collier, when I told you of it, You seem'd astounded.âWherefore this reserve? Fau. I know of no event so requisite As union of your house with that of Cecil. Moore. Ha? Say'st thou so?âGive me thy hand, brave Faucet. Thy valour only parallels thy wisdom. Thou never said'st a word in all thy life I loved so well to hear.âI rightly judged That thy discernment could not overlook This high impediment to England's weal. Fau. The reconcilement's much to be desired; And any way but this I would support it With all my powerâbut 'tis impossible!â Would I had ne'er been born, rather than known That I do know, and hear what now I hear! Moore. Impossible!âHow is't impossible?â What hast thou known and heard?âAm I in truth In my right mind? And do I hear and see As I was wont?âDo I look Barnard Faucet, My dearest friend, i'the face, and hear him speak? If so, I comprehend no share of it. Fau. Knight, thou hast done a deed the most unmeetâ The most pernicious to thy peace and honour, That headlong passion could have urged thee to. We'll talk no more on'tâ'Tis a theme that bars All patient converse; the bare mention of it Wounds in the tenderest partâname it no more. Moore. Ay, but we must, and shall talk on it, Faucet; For thou hast touch'd the tenderest chord that breathes Its music to the soul, which, when 'tis jarr'd, It is not to be borne. Fau. If we must talk on't, Prithee, not seriously, but let us turn it To what I ween it is, a goodly jest. Moore. Thy words are dreams to me; I cannot grasp In them substantial object, nor discern The slightest shade or outline of their tendence.â Can'st thou, Sir Richard, give me cue to them? (Collier shakes his head and turns away.â Moore looks confounded.âPause.) Fau. Come let's be gay on't.âIf you'll not look gay, And laugh, and jest, I bar all farther converse. That thing that finally must be a jest, The sooner so the better.âSay, Sir Anthony, How brook'st thou wedlock?âIs the golden chain So rivetted it galls and festers thee? Or hangs it on thy neck so loose that thou Can'st slip the noose, and run whene'er thou wilt? It must do so; I need not ask that question.â Still in the clouds?âWhy starest thou so, Sir Anthony? I'm serious now; whene'er I jest I'm serious. I give you joy of your right gleesome spouse, And much I'm sure you found, for you had vantage That many a good man lacks. Moore. Prithee be plain; Thy friend requests it.âWhat advantage mean'st thou? Fau. Thou had'st not to o'ercome that bashful modesty; That trifling, trembling, teazing delicacy, That many an honest man full sore hath plagued, For thou didst clasp a right complaisant bride. Moore. No more, I say.âIf thou presumest to vend More of such garbage counterfeit, I'll pay it In coin thou hast not palm'd. Fau. Nay, then I'm dumb. If you'll be serious on so light a subject, I've done with it.âBut if you'll laugh as I do, And you must shortly do, why then I'll tell you A secretâa most nice and witching secretâ A bride-bed secret.âI'll give you the words, The very words, and manner of those words Which one address'd to youâBut in your ear, (He mutters in Moore's ear, who starts in astonishment, and puts his hand several times on his sword.) And when she said thus, she did throw her arms Around your neck, and kiss'd you; and you trow'd These words had never before been said to man, Nor such a kiss bestow'd, and it did melt you. Once she misnamed you, seeming as she ween'd You other man; that somewhat startled you, But it was soon forgot.âIs this not true?â PatienceâNo blustering nor rage, I say. Speak as I speak to youâIs this not truth? Moore. Beshrew my heart, but what thou say'st is true, As far as memory gathers to a grain. How thou hast come possest, is far beyond The fathom of my mind.âBut this to me Thou shalt explain. Fau. Shalt!âNone of your Shalts. SayââPlease Sir Barnard Faucet to explain This point obscure,â or mystery, you may call it. Yes, call it mystery, or motley jest, Or some such matter beg me to explain; But do it cheerly, else you never shall Learn farther.âList to me, Sir Anthony:â If I can prove the feeling scene just named, Which so affected you, was then enacted, Though not with youâsay for the eightieth, Or for the hundredth time, will you then laugh At your right gleesome and ridiculous match? Moore. Wretch!âVillain! if thou darest insinuate One other shade of such blasphemous hue, Thou speak'st thy doom or mine. Fau. I'm dumb. I've said too much, if thou indeed art serious. Moore. Serious! Sir KnightâThe name of Caroline To me is sacred; for her spotless honour I'll brave the proudest eye o'erlooks a beard. Fau. 'Tis a bold threat, but safe; for well I ween There's none will lift the quarrel.âI'll not do it. Fight for the honour of Dame Caroline, And that to blood!âNo, by the scarlet queen That rests upon the waters!âFor 'tis more Than she herself e'er proffer'dâthough I've braved That honour's creamy front oftener than reckon'd. Come, Collier, come; our foes advance apace, And we have much at stake.âWe came not here To rail and banter about woman's honour; Sir Anthony, who values it, may claim My right in the fee simple of the whole For three brass Edwards.âHe who throws the glove In guard of that, will have warm work of it And stunted thanks.âI'll fight for woman's life, Her freedom, and her rights, even to a tittle; But not her honour!â I will fight for aught, Even to a grey stone or an English heath-bush,â But not for women's honour!âNo!â (Exit Faucet.âMoore lays hold of Collier, who is following.) Moore. O Collier, stayâallay this burning heat By some solution cool and rational. Does Faucet rave?âOr whereto bears his scorn, Unfold to me, Sir Richard. Col. I may not say Even that I know of this.âMy heart's more wrung Than yours by the event; but question not, For I'll not answer further word than this, Would it had been to do! (Exit Collier.) Moore. Would it had been to do!âHe may not say Even what he knows of it!âSuch hints I've had, So broad and so dismantled, that my mind Stares on a blank.âOur closest bride-bed converse Mouth'd in foul jest!âYe fountain-springs of madness! What does this mean?âI need not pause, nor scan, Nor lay position, for my mind's benumb'd,â The very dwarfs of calculation flout me. I see before me only sterile void, A waste of misery and despair, that leads Either to nothingness in mind's avail, Or something worse which language has not term'd. I'll seek those knights againâI know their love Unbiass'd and sincereâand force them speak All that they know.âI'll rather feign to laugh, And turn it to a jest, than suffer thus. (Exit.) SCENE II. An Apartment in a Castle. Cecil sitting on a Chair guardedâhis Sons standing by him, one on each side. Geo. Pardon, my loved and ever honour'd father, This harsh entreatmentâother course was not To bar thee from a deed most impious. Cecil. Thou puny passive surcle, darest thou say I had not right and ample cause to slay her? Geo. Haply, my lord, they both meant honourably, And ween'd their marriage might unite our houses, Whose rivalry has caused such grievous woes. Cecil. Such word to me again, thou shallow dunce, And I'll dislodge thy beingâAy, though prison'd, The man who speaks of union with the Moore To me, I'll crush himâwith my foot I'll crush him. And for prevention I will have her life; I say I'll have my daughter's life. Geo. Rather we'll hold thee Immured or bound for everâCould you see Our darling Caroline bathed in her blood By her own father's hand, and her dim eye Turn'd to the heaven to seek forgiveness there? Even for her murderer to ask forgiveness? Ah! could you bear that sight? Or could the afterthought By man be suffer'd? Cecil. Thank you, Sir Priest, For that divine and beautiful remark. Damn'd chattering sycophant!âthank you, sirâ I'm much beholden to youâpray go onâ Bestow thy sage advice on me, and say What's due to Caroline? Geo. Turn her from hence a beggarâ Disown herâsuffer none to shelter her. Let her go seek her Moore, since she preferr'd him To him who gave her life and loved her so. If he acknowledge her as his true spouse, And lady of his princely fair domains, Why, he deserves herâand, I needs must say, Claims our respectâBut should he shun, or flout, Or finally reject her, then he shows In his true colours to the worldâa wretch! And all the power of England shall not shroud him. Cecil. By heaven and earth, boy, thou say'st notably, Moth, pedant as thou art. Straight go and see This executed with the utmost rigour. And that old hag, her nurse and tutoressâ O lash me her!âI thirst to see the crone Scourged to a gangreneâand her very tongueâ Enter Esther suddenly. In hell's name, where goest thou? Est. Ah! Is he confined? Cecil. No, he's not confinedâ He's at thy earsâthy throat, old night-mare! Avaunt, thou portrait of pollution! Est. Alas! my lord, Till all was done, I nothing knew of this. Cecil. Thou did'st, thou did'st, thou did'st, thou knew'st it all, Plann'd, urged the encounter, and enjoy'd the fall Of innocence, as thy great master did When mask'd in EdenâAll of it was thine, The scheme and the fulfilment!âO thou brand! Thou hemlock hag! I'll have thee sear'd and toasted To a pure mummy, and preserved in oil, That not one atom of thy guilty frame Be lacking at the doomâO for this deed, Thou yet shall steep in the blue depth of hell, The sport of scavengers!âLet me come at her. I ask but of the witch one twist. (They hold him and make signs to herâShe runs offâThey lead him off at the opposite sideâ saying, as he retires,) She knew it allâshe knew it all, &amp;c. (Growling.) (Exeunt.) SCENE III. A Grove. Collier, Faucet. Col. Faucet, this is the most outrageous wrong That ever on two honest hearts was practised. Fau. Yes, and it grieves me; but thou art aware Our final ruin is the consequence Of such unition. Col. It is too apparent. Fau. Therefore it us behoves with all our power To frustrate and undo the fatal match. Col. It is a most cruel and unfriendly game! Fau. Ay, but the stake we play for, think of that, And judge if woman's sighs are countervail. A maid's regret is quickly overpast. I love Sir Anthony, nor would do aught Against his goodâbut I avouch this step Tends neither to his honour nor his peaceâ He's safer far without herâKeep we there. Col. Thou did'st astonish me not less than himâ How camest thou by their secret chamber converse? Fau. I have a cue none wots of; and, besides, So long an inmate of her father's house, I know her bye-words and her pretty oaths, And all the sly unmeaning terms that hang Upon her flexile tongue, and nothing lack But syllables to give them birth in music. A woman's tongue's the mere machine of feeling; Nor motive needs of ripen'd thought to move itâ It wags of willâso well I know all this, She could not in nice circumstance be placed, That I would not recite some words she utter'd. Though not precisely, he was then in mood To have believed it, whether true or not. Words said in transport barely are remember'dâ I knew I could give that would make the whole Like truth direct. Col. Whom do you mean to blame As her seducer? Will you criminate A stranger, or yourself? Fau. Nay you, perhaps; If you affect, you shall the honours wear Of this high envied prize. Col. I would rather not, If you so pleaseâ(Bowing.)âI humbly thank you, knight. Fau. But here the hero comes in woeful guise; Leave it to me, Sir Richard. Col. I do most cordially. Enter Moore. Moore. You left me too abruptly, brother warriorsâ You do not wish that women thus should part us? Fau. Therefore we left you. Moore. Thou wast short, my Faucet, Obscure, and harsh, and I must beg thee solve Thy hideous riddle, for its folds have nigh Reft me of reason. Fau. On my life, my lord, This is too much!âI, in my turn, must beg Of thee never to name the subject more. Talk of aught else, of battles, or alarms, And I'll consort thee, for such talk becomes us. But thus to harp on such a theme as woman! That puling, puking, garnish'd levity! I hate them all, yet never so as now. Moore. Few words will serve:âIn pity, Faucet, say All that thou know'st, for something thou dost know Of most vile import. Fau. Dost thou think I love thee? Moore. Did I e'er doubt it? Fau. I have set my life On a dead hazard, even for thine honour; Not once or twice, but often. Moore. Yes, thou hast. My generous friend, I cannot doubt thy love. Fau. Then, in one word, this sickening love engagement Must go no fartherâIt must either pass For trick of gallantry, else you and I Meet not againâThe feeling's much beyond What I can sufferâMust I tell you all? Moore. All, every thingâI am prepared for it. Fau. Thou know'st her chamber in the eastern turret, And the fruit-ladder's needful aidance well? Into that midnight chamber I've been welcomed, I need not say how oft. (Moore draws his sword slowly out of the sheath, eyeing him the while.) Nay, strike, my lord; If I have wrong'd thee, strike, for this is true. Could I bear this?âCan I see you enthrall'd By one that mocks you?âThis is not the whole: I have heard patterings at her window-board, And her smooth sounding name breathed by the sash, Soft as the whisper of the autumn breeze. (Calls in a whisper) âCaroline, Carolineâwakest thou, my Caroline? âChill hangs the night-dew on thy lover's cheek, âAnd scarce a star peeps through the rack of heaven! âO take him to thy bosom, Caroline!â Did'st thou thyself aye gain admittance there? Moore. Damnation on't! Why do you ask whether I did or not? Fau. Finding my conquest shared, I stranger grew; But late, returning from the wars, I went Unknowing aught of thee, and was receivedâ Moore. Hold, hold! no more! I see it all, and know How you possest our converseâInfamous! Fau. She told me all, and laugh'd at youâI fled As from a serpent's touchâAm I to blame? Moore. No, no, in friendship thou art honourable. Most infamous, abandon'd cub!âshe shall Pay dear for this!âCurse the whole sex!âI loathe them! Faucet, think'st thou that hell had ever been Unless for women? Fau. Pray view this as it is, A jestâsheer gallantry!âSuch things are done In England every day. Moore. (Furiously.) A jest, Sir Barnard! Did'st thou say jest?âNow, by the soul of him thatâ I was about to swear a dreadful oath, But I'll not do itâ(Feigns carelessness.)âView it as a jest? Why, so I doâit is a jestâHa, ha! (Laughs in his throat, then starts and looks serious.) 'Tis but a dream, a phantasyâbut then 'Tis such a pressure on the soulâa blight Upon the harvest of fair purposes, The reaper's paralizedâDid'st thou say jest? Then 'tis no dreamâDamn him that says it is One or the otherâhe that ever said Or framed such perilous blasphemy as this Within his heartâOh, I forgot; It is a jest, ha, ha!âA goodly one That soon will set mankind even to the lees, Grinning like monkies!âOut upon them all, The neighing chattering raceâand youâand you! (As they support him off, he alternately laughs franticly, and looks enraged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THIRD. SCENE I. An open Country. Caroline, Esther, in mean tattered habits. Est. Oh! I am ruin'd!âHapless, wayworn Esther! 'Tis hard that thou should'st victim fall to love, Now when so far beyond his arrow's range! Car. Be comforted, dear Esther; better days Await us nigh.â'Tis but a pilgrimage, A short one, and will end in happiness. Est. Ah me! I sorely dread the event, my Caroline! My race is nearly run, and for myself I care not; but for thee my heart is sick. I see nought but mishap and misery Awaiting on us.âWhat are we two like? I've studied all this day for simile, But none can find so low.âOnce on a time I cross'd the Stanmore waste; the day was cold, Chill, chill and barren, for the eastern blast Was hazed with driving hail; a feeble ewe, Outworn with age and famine, had sunk down By the way side.âSuch look of misery And hagard want in brute I never look'd on. A pretty lamb stood hanging over her, A mute meek innocent, that seem'd to share In all her sufferings; and I ween'd her looks Betray'd that half her pains were not her own; For ever and anon, as we drew nigh, These looks were rueful turn'd upon her lamb. She could not rise, for she had sunk to earth To rise no more; but, lifting her lean limb, Presented to her starving brood the dug. Fond it assayedâbut vainlyâfor alas! No kindly juice remain'd!âWith hopeless eye It turn'd around and patted on its dam, As urging her to rise.âAll unavailing, It tried to pick the scanty frozen shrubs, Then crept down in its feeble parent's bosom, With her to die. Car. Did you not rescue them? Ah, Esther! could you leave the hapless pair To perish thus? Est. Anon there came a hind Of brown uncourteous meinâhe pass'd the dam With slight regard, but took the yeanling up Below his plaid, while the old dying thing Look'd after him with many a tremulous bleat. âThou most unfeeling boor!â enraged I cried, âCan'st thou thus leave the feeble of thy flock, Ruthless, to perish?â Mildly he replied: âAlas! dear madam, it is o'er with her, And I must needs her little orphan save. Poor beast!â'Twas a good sheep to me and mine; Not nice of food, but pick'd upon this waste For many a year, and I will miss her sore. But she has served her time to us.ââThe tear Stood in the good lad's eye when he said this. Car. Prithee give over, Esther. Whether 'tis My poignant feelings at this time, I wot not, Or the incitement of your simple tale, But never did I feel so much disposed To play the child and cry. Est. And well thou may'stâ And well may Iâit is our archetype. Here we are on the wasteâthe world's wide waste, Turn'd out to pine with famine and repentance. Some pitying hind, when we are far from hence, And sinking under misery, will come, And, seeing thee so young and beautiful, And fit for useful life, will take thee up And shield thee in his bosom; but poor Esther He'll scarcely deign to look on, but pass by, Saying the while, in feigned mournful mood, âAy, let her lie thereâshe has served her time.â Car. No more, dear Esther. Know'st thou that I rejoice in this? Est. I give you joy on't then, With all my heart.âBut lately you did wish That you had more to give and more to suffer, In token of your love to your dear lord; As to the giving part, 'tis somewhat baulk'd, For neither of us two can give one mite To save us from perdition; but no lack Of suffering presentsâYou shall have roth Of that indulgence, I stand warrantise. Car. 'Tis sweet to suffer ill for those we love. O it will make me doubly dear to him! And you shall see the kindness of the knight You dared to doubt of constancy in love. Est. God grant my fears are vain. Car. Where shall we go to wait his coming, Esther? Think'st thou that he will place me in the north, Where he has lands and towers, that I may be Nigh him in this approaching northern war? Or leave me with my retinue at home At beauteous Castle-Benendine? Est. Then list:âFirst I arrede you haste From off your sire's domain, for we are watch'd, And none dare shelter us or give us bread. Come, Caroline, we must, like other beggars, Take rest a whileâcomplainâand journey on. (Exeunt.) SCENE II. A Cottage. Jasper, Kate. Kate. Ha, my old Jasper, hast thou heard the news? The wondrous news? Jas. Not that I know of, dame. But every thing's so wonderful with thee, I cannot tell whether I have or not. Kate. Well, since you're in your taunting, testy moods, You shall not hear a word on't. Jas. Oh, alack! What a sore pity!âGreat misfortune that! Kate. Dost mock? Or are you serious, Master Jasper? Jas. Mock! I am serious as religion is. Kate. Oh, then I'll tell you allâBut had you mock'd!â Jas. 'Tis much the sameâ'twill out. Kate. Come, be good-natured, Jasper, and give up That quippish way with me. Jas. Well, that I will, my good old KateâAs erst I'll hear this wondrous mighty secret out, And smile, although it should be a full hour Before you reach the point, and haply then I may not mark, or find the secret out; Yet I will list well pleased, and say, âIndeed? That is most wondrous!âAy!âand is it thus?â I'll do all this. (Sits down and puts himself all right.) Now, prithee, Kate, go on. Kate. Thou shalt not be so triedâThe story's this, We've changed our master. Jas. (Starting up.) Eh?âWhat? Kate. Is that a trifle? Jas. NoâEh? What of it?âsay. Kate. We've changed our master. Cecil, our lord, hath forfeited and fallen, And all the land, farther than I know where, Is given to that young Moore of Benendine, And now we hold of him. Jas. I'm sorry for't. A pest upon that Moore, if he hold on He'll soon possess all England.âIs this truth? Kate. Most pointed, upright truth. Jas. I'm sorry for it! Kate. Why, Cecil was a tyrant. Jas. He was. Kate. And took our horses and our sons to service Whene'er he listed. Jas. He did. Kate. Then why regret that we are freed of him? Jas. I like not innovation so express, Ere men have time to think on'tâNor to see Old families pull'd down that long have borne The credit of the land, through good and evil. I'll not pay doit to Moore. Kate. Jasper, you're crazedâOft have I heard you curse Cecil, our lord, in bitterness of heart. Jas. 'Tis falseâI ne'er did soâand, if I did, 'Twas very wrong. Kate. Besides, remember we're in deep arrears, Which we can ill repayâthis frees us all. Jas. No, dame, it does not free usâtrue it is, Mid such combustion it will ne'er be claim'd; But something here tells me I am not free. Hard though my ancient master was, I'll pay him, Ay, to the utmost mail-mite. Enter Cubbin. Cub. Ha, feather and muother! Here's such a tragedy to be transacted! O, it will be a garland for the maids An' hundred years agoâwhen they shall hear The Reldon tragedy how they will pipe! Jas. How now, son Cubbin?âstand, I pray thee, still, And give us key to this your tragedy. Cub. (Pulling them.) Come, come along, they're just a dying, sir. Jas. Who?âPray, who are dying, boy? Cub. The women, sirâthe womenâcome along, What devil makes you stay? Jas. HoldâStayâWhat women mean'st thou, boy? Cub. Why, the poor dying womenâsure, I told you. Jas. Not that I mark'd. Cub. I found them starvingâone is the most lovely, The other the most queer of all the seck. She scarce had voice remaining when I went; I look'd at her, and thought her gone indeed. Poor wife, said Iâand I was weeping tooâ I fear thy glass is runâ'tis o'er with thee! But 'tis less matter, thou hast served thy time! I must take care of thee, thou pretty young thing. And, when I said so, the old creature laugh'd. Jas. Laugh'd!âDid she laugh? Cub. She laugh'd outright. And though 'twas like the cackle in the dawn Of starving hen that hatches in the wood, Yet still she laugh'd. (Mimicking.) I told you so, cried she. Did I not tell you so, love Caroline? And then she held her sides, and laugh'd, and cried. Come, feather, muother, have you christian souls, That you'll not run to save the dead?â (Exit, pulling them.) SCENE III. A Grove. Enter Faucet. Fau. I've scaled a dubious venture, and yet won, Turning the beam by throwing in mere sound, By some unform'd, unsubstanced things call'd words, Born of the passing airâAy, but the air That woos the heart and tongue of policy Issues with matter in't, and sets the world In bustle or in flame. Enter Collier. How does our general, brave Sir Anthony? Does he hold calmâor is his mind unfix'd, No more to square? Col. Heaven knows, Sir Barnard! My heart misgives me grievously in this; To see a noble mind so overpower'd By machinations of such vile proportion With honest truth.âNow he is reasonableâ Anon the current of his mind recedes Back on a gloomy vale, and stagnates there. Hard then the task to drain it to its channel, In which it flows still with uncertainty. Fau. But is his hate and indignation fix'd? For that's our first concern. Col. He shudders at the very name of Caroline, And all that tends to Cecil. Fau. That's well, that's wellâOn that continued hate, And that alone, rests our stabiliment. All passions else must to our purpose yield. And to secure our point beyond control, He needs must wed another, and that shortlyâ Ay, and more publicly than he did Caroline. Col. Ah! grief!âWhere will this end?âWould I had had No hand in itâfarther I will not have. Fau. One single glance will shew thee how decisive This stroke must beâCome, we will jointly go And break the matter to him. (Exeunt.) SCENE IV. Before a Cottage. Jasper, Kate, Cubbin. Jas. I tell thee, wife, no moreâpray let them go. Can we afford to keep two idle vagrants, Who have nought wherewithal to recompence? We scarce can help ourselves. Kate. But they are distress'd, And kind, and goodâpray, my good Jasper, shield them, Though but a little whileâheaven will reward it. Jas. I fear they are not better than behoves. We know them notâBut you're so newfangled! Yes, all your sex are soâWell, keep them, Kate. If I aught know of you, you shall the first Urge their dismissalâPrithee, keep them, Kate, Long as you will, you have my free consent. Kate. That's my kind husbandâNow let's visit them. SCENE V. Inside of the Cottage. CarolineâEsther, looking at a letter. Est. The letter's very wellâjust as it should be. This sets his love and honour in true light. Seal it, and I will send it by the youth As from myself. Enter Jasper, Kate, Cubbin. Jas. Give you good morning, folkâ Are you restored and well? Car. Refresh'd and well, thanks to your generous hearts, And might I farther on your goodness tread, I would beseech short sanctuary here, Till rescued from this plight. Kate. Pray, Jasper, welcome them. Jas. I leave that office to yourself, good Kate; They are your guests, I do not like them much. Kate. Good folk, my husband says you are most welcome To make this house your own and all that's in it, While your convenience suits. Jas. I never said such wordâyou're mad, old wife! Oh! you slim women folk!âye're all so newfangled! Car. Know'st thou, good Cubbin, where the army lies? Cub. Yes. Est. Is't far from hence? Cub. No. Est. And is the general with it? Cub. Yes. Est. Wilt thou go ere he moves into the north, And give this letter to him? Cub. Yes. Est. And he will well requite you for your trouble. Car. Yes, he will pay you wellâO you will be A welcome messenger to him. Jas. (Aside.) Wife, is it thus? Does our new noble lord consort with beggars? I do not like them, Kate! Kate. Some great ones, husbandâ Some great folks in disguiseâAh, you've a head! Jas. I do not like themâsee how beautiful That young one is. Kate. And what harm can her beauty do to you? Jas. But, Cubbin, you knowâmayâ(Nods.) Eh? Kate. Go! ye're a weak old man! Est. Now, have you noted these directions, Cubbin? Cub. Yes. (Going out, returns.) But are you sure there is not small mistake? Is it the general, Sir Anthony, To whom you send me? Est. The sameâHave I not told you? Cub. (Aside.) This is beyond me!âMy capacity Cannot about it!âMother, do you ween She's quite well hereabouts? Jas. Peace, boy, and go thy message. Cub. Yes. (Exeunt Cubbin, Jasper, and Kate.) Car. O, Esther, I am sick till his return! Would it were over, for I dread my heart Can scarcely bear such burst of tenderness, And kind endearment.âIf you loved as I do, Then would you feel how the rapt soul is thrill'd, And all the sensous filaments of mind Steep'd in delirious agony, the while We anxious wait the long-wish'd lingering moment That gives us to the arms we love for ever. Our day is now o'ercast with lowering clouds; But when the sun breaks through the darksome folds, O it will be more sweet! SCENE VI. A Grove. Enter Moore. Moore. It is not true.âMy mind does not get mazed Whene'er I talk of women.âI can talk, And think, and reason, well as heretofore, And more to th'point, which now I state for trial, And will maintain itâFemale Purity!â Noâthe position's false.âMen are flagitious, And every libertine lets go the rein, Arms him with lures and guilt insatiate, And spurs the steed to havock.âDown amain What numbers mark his course!â Make then the estimate, and where remains The sacred spot where female purity Grows uncontaminate?âO misery! Is this most fair and goodly heritage,â This garden which the hand of God hath planted With flowers of life, one half of them so lovely That but for them beauty had never been, Nor term to know it by,âOh, are they all What I now deem them!âThere was one that bloom'd So pure, that on its opening breast I ween'd I saw the dyes of heaven; that I watch'd, And, ere full blown, with tenderest guidance cropp'd And took it for my all.âBut then I loved it!â O God! how I did love it! But in its folding buds I found enclosedâ Ay I found that, will blur the world's fair face, And turn it to a hell to me for ever! Enter Collier. Col. Give up these toilsome thoughts, my lord, for they But madden and distract you. Moore. 'Tis false; I am not mad whene'er I talk Of women and their ways. I love the sex Well as I oughtâI'll wed the Lady Ellen Whene'er you list, because I love the sex Just as I ought.âBut O, that purple flower That grew upon the wall, the eastern towerâ Did you not say it was the eastern turret? Ah, that can never be replaced again! The wounded stem will never heal, but bleed, And bleed, and bleed! and then the brain will burn! Should I not therefore love her?âI but said, That in her mould there was a flame would spread And scorch the soul to films, or to a vapour. But that's no cause I should not love her, Collier; For when the thunder breaks, thou wot'stâ Col. What then, my lord? Moore. Why then, 'tis Heaven that thunders; For I have seen't myself work such deray, And pour forth liquid fire to sear and waste; And should we not love Heaven?âOh fie!âGo to! Thy reasons will not hold. Col. (Aside.) Wretch that I am, Thus to connive in grossest calumny, And see two precious minds uprooted quite, And their possessors doom'd to misery. I'll give the truth to light, for I set not My life or my possessions at a pin In such heart-breaking case.âCheer thee, my lord, For the foul tale thou heard'st of Caroline Is false as hell.â Moore. Hush! thou know'st nought of hell. If thou had'st stood thus on its brink as I do, A thousand, thousand years, breathing thin flameâ The tale's equivocal, and fits thee not. (During the following speech Moore listens with eager and unstable attention.) Col. My lord, give heed to what I say to thee: It thee befits thy broken heart to heal; Dispel that gloom and be thyself again; For all the shameful charges thou hast heard Against thy blooming bride, fair Caroline, Are framed and impious lies.âI do not ween That in the list of living dames there is One so unstain'd and pure as Caroline Cecil. Enter Faucet behind, who hears part of the speech. Fau. (Aside to Collier.) Thou baby-hearted fool! what hast thou said? Col. I'll say more yet, Sir Barnard. Fau. My lord, the fiery Douglas is advancing, Before him terror spreads with withering breath, And ruin sleeps behindâwe must begone. Moore. Douglas advancing?âIt is well remember'd. To-morrow Pembroke warriors will arrive, Then forthwith hie we to the north to meet That restless Douglas.âHa?âWhat said'st thou, Collier? Fau. (Aside to Collier.) If not for thy own sake, for mine refrain. Moore. What did you say, Sir Richard? Col. Nought, my good lord. Moore. Then what said I?âFor something sure was said, Or was to say, I would not for an empire That I had lost. Fau. We talk'd of Douglas, captain, And of the havock that his army makes Among our friends and countrymen. Moore. Douglas?â'tis trueâNo, this was not of Douglas. Can none of you remind me what we talk'd of? Was it not of a blossom'd stem?âA wall-flower? Or something that took flame?âI have it here, Yet it lies folded in my soul so deep That memory cannot reach it.âAh, is it gone? Then I would travel to the utmost verge Of the green world to regain that thought, Or word, or tale, or whatsoe'er it was. Fau. My lord, these thoughts that in a moment fly Leave shadow of importance on the mind, And set it hunting after them intense; But if by chance, or by associate word, The anxiously regretted thing is caught, It is so trivial we're ashamed to own it, Or give it utteranceâpray let it pass, The search is unavailing. Moore. Well, well, 'tis lostâI would it were not so. But it is lost, and haply it avails not. I'm somewhat feverishâlet us mount our steeds And view our warriors' rendezvousâlead on. (Exeunt.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT FOURTH. SCENE I. A Cottage. Caroline, Esther. Est. At length the anxious moments are outrun; There comes our youth, with slow and sullen pace, Switching the ling with's staff, and ambling so As if he had forgot his thought behind him, And walk'd from instinctâHe is much unlike Love's messenger, with tidings of success. Car. Do you receive him, Esther; my weak heart Is all so tremblingly alive and full, I will retire a moment, and give vent To feelings hitherto unknown to me. Receive him, Esther, and converse with him, I will return anon. (Exit.) Enter Cubbin. Est. Well, Cubbin, hast thou seen Sir Anthony, And given my letter? Cub. Yes. Est. How look'd he?âHow was he affected by it? Cub. Most wickedly affected. Est. I'm glad of that. Cub. Glad!âO, here's a carline for you! Does it rejoice thee so that men go mad? Est. What message does he send? Cub. None. Est. None! Cub. No, none that's known to me. Est. What did he say?âHow look'd he?âTell me all. Cub. YesâFirst, then, he look'd most like a madman; And what he said was so confused and contrary, I could not eke't to senseâSee, I will shew you Pat how he look'd and spokeâHe oped the letter. âAh, wretch!â said he, âwhat's this?âI'll run! I'll fly! Get me my steedâHolla!âGet me a steed! Speed the caparison.â With that there came A gruff and stately knight, with aspect deep, And link'd his arm in his, leading him off Into a chamberâShort time did I wait Ere he return'd, and strode athwart the floor, Fuming and uttering incoherent stuff Of fruit-ladders and windowsâThen he said, âSo thou keep'st common women at thy house, And runn'st their errands tooâIs it not so? Are they not common women?â Est. And, booby, what said'st thou to that? Cub. I said, yes. Then he gave me this letter. âGo back to them,â said he, âgo back to them; Give her that sent you, this,â which thus I do. Then with a laugh, like gaoler in his sleep, He strode away, and more of him I saw not. Est. Oh my foreboding heart!âI like it not. All, all depends on thisâOh Caroline! Come in, love Caroline, and read our fate, If it be joy, or misery condign. Re-enter Caroline, who takes the letter. Car. It is his hand and sealâLeave us, good Cubbin. (Kissing the letter.) Bless his kind heart!âBut yet he might have been Here ere this time himself. (She opens the letterâbecomes still as a statue, and lets the letter fall.) Est. Ha! is it so indeed?âIs there on earth A monster can desert thee, Caroline, In such a plight? (Lifts the letter and looks at it.) O beast!âO ruffian!âIf a voice from heaven Had spoke and said that such a man did live, I'd not have trow'd it.âAh, if he but knew The value of the heart that he is breaking!â Yet, yet he could not do't, fiend as he is! (Reads.) âMadamâMy conduct, regarded as cruel, is not once to be set in comparison with that the Cecils have done to me. Our marriage was a sham, a mere trick of love, which I hope you have sense and spirit enough to forgive. I'll have no wivingâif you list to follow the camp in another light, the credit be yours.âThe prior claims of my friend may haply be relinquished.â I know you well enough. âAnthony Moore.â O might I once but conjure up the fiends Of vengeance at my instance!âYe dark powers, From your eternal portals of despair, Rise on your baleful wings with gleesome speed To your well-earned preyâand, first of all, Inspire my tongue to curse him in the name Of all the saints that influence the Godhead. NoâI'll not spend a single curse upon him; For he has that already in his heart Shall burn unquenchable, while earthly mould Mures his devoted soulâAy, and while last The vital yearnings of the heaven-born mind, And that they say's long, long.âCheer thee, my love, And teach thy heart such baseness to despise. Car. O Esther, make my bedâand make it dark; Shut out that light that moves the busy world, And all the din of natureâshut them from me, Kind Esther!âmake my bed and make it soft, For I would fain go sleep. Est. No crime is thine, Dear injured angel! thou may'st sleep in peace With heaven, with thy own heart, and all mankind. Car. Nay, do not weep for meâSee, I weep none; But haste and make my bed, for oh, I long To lay my head upon its rush-wove pillow, And deeply, soundly sleep. SCENE II. Jasper, KateâTo them enter Esther. Est. Good dame, my poor young friend is gone to sleep, Much indisposed, I fearâwatch how she rests, While I for one hour seek yon lonely dell To ponder and to weep.âDame, our last stay, The only rest to which we lean'd is broke, And left us gall'd and woundedânow we are Most wretchedâFor the love of gracious heaven, Good dame, look to my friend. (Exit Esther.) Kate. Husband, you're a wise manâ I seldom, in the run, have ever found you Far out in estimate of man or woman. Now I bethink me of your honest fears. 'Tis meet we pack these women to the door, And let them shift as we do, for themselves. Jas. Ah, Kate!âAh, Kate! it was not then, I fear, For love of heaven, or pure benevolence, You took these hapless wanderers to your home; But some mean selfish motiveâTrust me, Kate, You'll never win heaven by such a game as that. Kate. But then, say they are wicked creatures, husband, As wisely you suggested?âThink of thatâ And then cast-off too!âPray let them be going. Jas. That case I leave to Him who knows the heart And secret ways of menâthus much I know, That they are wretched, that is plea enoughâ Nor will I turn them hence while I have bread, And household-room to share with them. Kate. O yesâI see how the land liesâthe young one, You have some hankering thereâI see, I see! Jas. Go!âYou're a weak old woman!âWell, I'll go And tend on her myself. Kate. Nay, with your leave, One step you go not thereâBut that you lack All sense of honour and propriety, You would not profferâ Jas. Then may I trust that you'll be kind to her? Kate. Certes I will, since 'tis my husband's wish, I will be kind as if she were my own. Jas. That's my good KateâGod bless thee, my old wife! If she is sick, thou hast a blessed cordial, Which often sooth'd our pains in soft oblivion, When we were all so illâGive her of that: None can administer that drug so well, For none so oft as you hath proved its power. Kate. No moreâmy heart is now all bent on kindness. SCENE III. The interior of a Cottage.âA flock-bed at the farther end. CarolineâTo her enter Kate softly. Kate. I fear'd to wake you, but I see you're up; I hope you are not ill. Car. I am not sick, Only a kind of drowsiness hangs on me, And yet I cannot sleep.âI should be well Could I but sleep one hourâIs there no balm, No elixir to sooth the aching sense In deep forgetfulness a little while? Kate. Of all the ailments that beset our nature In virulent array, and stint the alms Of niggard happiness, there is not one I can so well gainsayâI have a drug, Sent from afar, when we were visited By grievous sicknessâOne small drop of it Will bring the boon you askâA night, or day, Will so o'erpass in downy dancing slumber, You shall not miss itâIt will make you dream Of thousand garish freaks, all unconnected; Two drops will lull you deeper, and your dream Will be far-fetch'd and regularâBut three, Three drops, not bigger than the tear that hangs On a young eye-lash, will o'erpower all motion Of fancy or of frame; and one whole day Outslept, shall only as a moment seem; But all beyond is deathâShall I bring you that? Or dare you trust my hand to pour it for you? Car. Bring it, good dame. (Exit Kate.) O how I long for it! If I could cease to think, why I might wake; But nature is so changed unto mine eye, That I must either learn to think anew, Or not at all.âI cannot think of mankind, Therefore I'll sleep and dream of them. Re-enter Kate with a cup, vial, and water. Give me it, dame, I'll drop it for myself. Kate. I'll watch you then, and if you are not cautious, One drop you shall not swallow. Car. I'll take but one, It is enough for meâI long to dream Of things my mind is used toâI have dream'd So long on them that fancy cannot frame Or image aught that grows not on one base. Kate. You're over cautiousâtwo such other drops Will more effective proveâtrust me, they would. Car. One is enoughâI'll take no more of it. Let nought disturb meâlet me neither hear, Nor see, nor feel, for one short hour or two. Kate. Since I perceive thee timid of thy life, Even to a fault, I will this cordial leaveâ If you prove sicklyâif that still you feel Feverish and restless, two small drops will bring Most blissful restâpeace to thy heart a while. (Exit Kate.) Car. Ah! peace can never more revisit it! No, I may sleep, and dream, and sleep again; Still I must waken to the blasting view Of images I have not strength to look on! Oh, never did the thirsty traveller, Across the parch'd and burning desert, long So much to rest beside the cooling spring, As I do now to steep my every sense In deep and far forgetfulnessâ'Tis strangeâ Is it not strange that on my heart should press This fervent longing for oblivious sleep, And lo, the power, unsought, presents itself?â Already 'tis decidedâAll enquiry Will only add new pangs.âCome, thou sweetmeathe, I thirst for thee; nor do I dread the dreams Of unexplored existenceâAh! retract!â No more!âno more!âWould I not give this world, If this fair world were mine, had other hand But mix'd that drug for me, and I not known it. Or were I mad as is the raving whirlwind, Then would not the high Everlasting blame A poor heart-broken injured sufferer. I do not brave thee, Fatherâbut even thus, Thus dare I trust thy mercy. (Drinks out the vial.) (Pause.) I'll go as calmly to my last repose As if 'twere but a night; nor shall they know How Caroline Cecil died.âCome, Lethe, come; Again I'll fill thy sleepy bowels up. (Fills the Glass.) Thou little minister of sweet oblivion, Thou hast already heaved my drooping mind Above the grovelling petty ills of life. Even but to-day there was no thing on earth So absolutely wretched and undone, But nowâNow!âAh, what now?âI do not know, Nor can the tongue of mortal man disclose, What I shall be to-morrow.â (Pause.) Oft have I thought of it; and deeply too! But I can form no image of perfection! I've thought of lingering on the green hill-side Amid the watchful deer, by them unseen; Like quivering Ã¦rial thing, stand by, Noting their comely port, watching their eyes, In pleasing wonder how they could not see me. Or on the sward, beside the sleeping lamb, To sit and muse on innocenceâto love itâ Kiss its unweening lip, and stroke its fleece With my light shadowy hand; and on its side And woolly cheek lay me in mimic slumber. And I have thought of sitting on the fringe Of some white cloud that travels in the skies, Fleeting, incumbent on the summer gale, O'er isles and seas, and o'er the dappled vales Of this fair pendant world.âYes, I have dream'd Of these and thousands more, but never yet Could frame one thought of pain or misery As coming from that all-benevolent source Of mercy and of life.âO never! never! And with the self-same feeling I take leave Of life and all its treacherous promises. Enter Esther, George, Kate, Jasper. Est. Pardon, dear lady; here comes one whose love And care brooks not delay. Geo. O, my dear sister, do I find thee thus, An outcast and forsaken!âMy heart bleeds To see thee in this guise, my Caroline. Car. Art thou so kind to seek me?âI scarce deem'd That any heart beat with regret or love For poor forsaken Caroline. Geo. Alas! Our house has been one scene of dark despair From that sad hour you left it.âOur old sire Is sinking underneath a load of grief, Even to the gates of death.âHis rage is gone, Subsided to a soft depressive woe That vents itself in sighs and bitter tears For thee his darling.âTrust me, Caroline, Thy presence, and thy ever-loved embrace, Would now delight his soul far more than all The bliss that proud ambition e'er did yield. I've sought thee out with joy, to bear thee back To thy paternal home. Car. It is too late! Back to my father's house I ne'er return. There is but one home now can hide my shame, And soon I will be there.âO, my dear brother, The hand of death is on me!âMy heart's broke. Before that sun that journies down the west Hath reach'd the line of yon extended waste, I shall be in the walks of mortal life, As I had never been. Geo. Thou say'st that word With such a mein, and such a voice, that I Am moved with horror. Car. Be not moved, my brother. See I am calm as is the setting eve Of a spring day, fit emblem of my fate! Thou know'st how well I loved the setting sun; And I could wish to live one other hour To see that sight againâBut it is o'er! Even but last night, full of blithe hope and joy, I saw him in his rubied glory burn Across the golden windows of the west, And lean his glowing cheek upon the moor As if to set its darken'd bulk on flame; And I rejoiced, yet wept, I knew not why. I did not ween it was the last time I Should ever see that sceneâHe'll set to-night, And through that lattice pour his ruddy beam, But not on me!âOr only on the dust That late was Caroline. Geo. Let not thy grief O'erpower thy reason, sister; thou shalt live, Long long and happy. Car. (Taking his hand.) Fare thee well, my brother. I feel the grasp of death; I lay me down Upon that bed to rise no more.âI have One little boon to askâTo save my memory From brand I cannot name, let me be laid In Moore's own tombâit is my last request Of him to whom my sacred vow was pledged Before high Heaven. Geo. O, every wish which thy loved lips can frame, I hold as sacred. Car. Come thou near me, Esther. Thou hast been true to me; farewell, dear Esther. When thou shalt fit the dead-clothes on this form, Which thou hast oft embraced, let it be deck'd In all my bridal robesâthey're bootless now, None after me must wear themâpromise this. Est. O! I can promise nought, nor aught perform, My feelings all are thereâand if thou diest, I shall not stay behind. Car. (Heavily.) My tie to nature's brokeâJasperâgood dame, Give me your handsâRemember them, my brother, And give me one last kissâfor when I lie Down on that bed, I speak no more. (They embraceâCaroline stretches herself on the bed, and sinks asleepâPause.) Geo. Is this illusion?âNoâyou all behold it, And are amazed as I am.âCaroline! O, my loved sister, lift those eyes again, And speak to me! (She stretches forth her hand feebly, they all embrace itâit lies still on the bed till they lift it to her side.) Jas. O let us cry aloud to Heaven, for now There is but one that can restore her to us. Kate. Hold, hold. Or if you pray, pray for the dead. She breathes no moreâOft have I look'd on death, And dreaded it till now; but such a sight I never thought to see.âO, 'tis most strange! As calmly hath she enter'd death's domain As child when rock'd to slumber. Give us leave Few minutes, till we lay the lifeless form In decent guise, then bring our neighbours in, And let us join and sing the hymn of death. (Exeunt Jasper and George.) (Scene closesâafter a minute or two, an Hymn is sung within.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT FIFTH. SCENE I. The CountryâA Battle-Field in the distance. Moore, Collier. Moore. Ah, it has been a day of desperate strife! Sanguine and stern!ânor is the victory Yet certain; for I saw our right borne back, Reeling and cumber'd, to yon hollow dell. Let henchman speed to Faucet, and return Swift with the tidings. Enter Messenger. Mes. Captains, the day is ours! The Scots, for all their desperate might, are foil'd, And hie them for the Border. Moore. Then to the spoil, brave fellow. Mes. Spoil, my lord! They have not left in all their camp one thing An Englishman would liftâsome flabby shoes, Most villainous of make, with goatskin wallets, And meazled bags stuff'd with unseemly bran. Moore. Ah, they are yare And hardy knaves!âWe are well rid of them. Is Faucet safe?âAnd Howard, is he well? Mes. Howard is well, and urging the pursuit; But ah, my lord, it grieves me to inform you, Brave Faucet is no more. Moore. Has Faucet fallen? 'Tis then a costly victory for England! We have no braver captain left behind. Mes. By the resistless Douglas he was slain, Who bore down all before him.âWhen they met, O never was such dread encounter seen! The ranks paused and look'd onâBut Faucet fell! We bore him off, for at that time our troops Began to reel amainâI by him stood Till his last breath, and found him sore amazed, And grievously perplex'd about somewhat That did concern yourself, Sir Anthony: âAh, could I see him!âOne short word with him Would give my heart reliefâBut Collier willâ Collier will tell him allâAh, should he not!â Say unto Collier, he must tell him all;â Were the last words he utter'd. Moore. What can this mean?âCan'st thou unriddle it? (Collier beckons to the Messenger, who departs.) Col. Full wellâCaptain, thou hast a tale to hear Will chill thy heart!âIt is of Caroline. Moore. Talk not of her. Col. Yes, I must talk of her; For ne'er was beauty, purity, and love So foully, and so impiously belied. Ay, thou may'st stare! List me, now thou art calm. To hide the boldest and the deepest plot That e'er by man was framedâa plot that brought Proud Cecil to the dust, and raised up thee With all thy friends, the falsehood was devised. I knew it all. Moore. Then, Collier, thou art damn'd If thou knew'st thatâOh, if this tale be trueâ Col. Sooth, my good lord, it isâThere is no mind, Nor mould that love can frame, or fancy draw, More pure than Caroline Cecil. Moore. Then what a dolt, and what a wretch was I! But I will love her in amends for this, O doubly dear!âThere is no speech nor tongue Can paint how I will love my injured bride! And I'll again love all the human race For sake of Caroline!âNow I can think With calmness on our nature, which erewhile For days and nights hath quite unhinged the powers Of memory, and shook the throne of reason. Go, Collier, find her out and comfort her: Say I have labour'd under sad derangementâ Say any thing to cheer her; but do not Re-wound that kind and virtuous heart, by hint That I believed her false.âI'll post away To Benendine, and speed preparative Such as hath never welcomed English bride. Now I am well again with all mankind! Set that intolerant spirit of ambition Aside, and men are beings of regard. And woman!âThere is not on nature's face Aught half so pure, so loving, and so sweet, As I deem womanâand my heart exults That such a feeling now revisits it. SCENE II. The Cottage. Cecil, Ralph, George, with Artificers and Mourners âA splendid open Coffin is seenâCecil kneeling beside itâAs the Scene draws he rises slowly. Cecil. Forgive me, boysâI've play'd the woman here Haply too longâClose up that gaping urn. Shut, shut its raven jaws, and spread the pall; For now the face of my dear child is hid, I cannot bear to look on't.âAll that blaze Of heraldry o'er its funereal mould Is hateful mockeryâLet it be pall'd Forthwith, that eye of man may not behold Such flummery of device. (To the artificer.) Hold thee, good friend, Thy haste's officiousâWho bade thee put forth These knuckled paws upon that sacred bier With such important bustle?âStand aside Till thou art ask'd. Geo. My lord and sire, remember The day wears on apace, the rites are o'er, And death's pale visage suits not with the eye Of kindred and the sunâO! it is best Shrouded from view!âNow the artificer Must needs have doneâRestrain your ire, my lord. Cecil. Alas! my ire and pride of heart are o'er! I cherish neither: I consign them both, With every earthly passion to that urn. No more shall nature's bustle trouble me!â Adieu, my childâa short adieu I bid thee. So good and so beloved was never yet So injured and abusedâO, I list much To sit and watch thee stillâto look on thee; But I'm restrain'd and check'd.âI have no ire, But that I hate to see such knaves as that Thrust their officious and important snouts Upon the griefs of men, as much as saying, Keep all aloof, I'm hereâFor that you say That I am ireful.âAh! you little weigh The cause I have for other feelings here Than aught of ire! But it is always thus; I cannot utter word but I'm in ire, And check'd by boys.âFor failings of old age, And such misfortunes, some regard is due. True, I am proud!âO, thou departed saint, My pride hath kill'd thee! That calm face of thine Will haunt me on the bed of death.âFarewell!â This is the lastâI cannot bear to see thee Closed from the light for ever. Enter Collier. Whom seek'st thou here, false knight? Thou art abettor Of low deceit and perjury.âAroynt! Thou look'st upon thine enemy. Col. I dread To ask what this may mean.âIf that I fear Has happ'd, then guilt hath wrought its masterpiece. (Reads the inscription.) O horror!âCaroline! Cecil. Does this suffice thy malice? Is that Moore Now glutted with revenge? Or is there still Farther device that may depress old Cecil? There is but one step lower thou can'st thrust him, And that's into his grave. If thou hast soul Or might to do it, both of which thou lack'st, (Drawing.) The sooner so the better. Geo. Is this becoming, father?âThou may'st see Sir Richard grieved as we are.âWhy this heat? Cecil. Heat! Heat again!âGrieved, did you say? No, he rejoices in'tâhe and his friend, The most redoubted MooreâO, how they joy In this dear sacrifice! Col. Ah! Moore is blameless; Would Heaven that I were so!âI might have saved That precious life. Cecil. Thou might'st have saved that life, And yet then did'st not do it!âO, thou fiend, Does that neglect alone not charter thee In endless torment? Geo. Consider, honour'd sire, If none else might have saved her. Cecil. There struck the pang!âDid'st thou advise it not? Was it not thine?âO, all of you are blameless, Save her unhappy father!âall the guilt Lies heap'd on his grey head!âBut short the space That his worn frame shall totter under it. Knight, I had boon to ask of your high friend, That demi-god of EnglandâOn my knees I meant to beg it of himâCan'st thou save My age the toilâthe pleasureâwhich thou wilt? My daughterâshe that was my daughter there, That victim of thy malice, did request With her last breath, her body might be laid In Moore's own family vault, to save her name From stain that might attach it. Col. I ensure My hapless friend's assent. Alas! his mind And frame will never this deep loss survive! I'll go and warn him.âIs't not meet, my lord, An husband should be guest, and see deposed The dust so dear to him? Cecil. It is, it is; but let him bring his sword; She was a warrior's child, and ween'd herself A warrior's bride, and therefore it is fit. No wordsâBear forth the bodyâWarn our train, The day's too far advanced. SCENE III. Benendine Castle. Moore and Page. Moore. The time moves heavily!âAre all my halls And bowers richly bedight? Page. They are, my lord. Moore. And all my yeomen ready to take horse? Page. They're all array'd and tending in the court With arm on mane. Moore. How bears my milk-white steed his new array, His side-saddle and belts? Page. He stands caparison'd in burning gold And broider'd silk, much wondering at himself. But ah, how proud!âIt is a noble beast! Moore. 'Tis now high noon, and not a word from Collier! Nor know I yet the route that we must take! I cannot brook this pause!âMount and away; By the Cross-church we ride, belike that way We'll meet himself or messenger. SCENE IV. A Burial-ground, with an Aisle, Monument, and Escutcheons behind, the Coffin standing covered with a pall. Cecil, Ralph, George, Mourners, Church-warden, &amp;c. Cecil. I tell thee, foolish warden, in that aisle The body shall be laidâI've warrantise, Therefore give up the keys without demur, Or, in one word, I'll twist thy shrivell'd nape, And force our entrance. War. I had no previous note of this, Lord Cecil; Therefore I dread some plot, and do protest Against such outrage.âBut dispute must cease, For here our brave young lord is hard at hand, With nine-score gallant yeomen in his train. Cecil. Ha! we're betray'd!âStand to your arms, young men. (Looking back as to warriors behind.) Though twice our number, they shall dearly buy The last blood of the Cecils. Geo. The chief himself approaches, and his train Are left behind.âAccost him with respect. Enter Moore. Cecil. Comest thou to fight, Sir Anthony? Or comest thou To mock the funeral in that array? Moore. The Cecils here!âMy lord, I nothing knew That any branch of Cecil's noble stem Was lopp'd by death.âThus far upon my way I've come with purpose of the kindest love To Cecil and his race, and o'er the dust That once was relative to that, trust me, I'll shed the kindred tear. Cecil. A tear from thee! No; the ingredient is not in thy nature From which a tear distils, else we had never Stood at thy aisle-door begging for admission To lay our dead. Moore. And who is't dares refuse?â Lord Cecil could not favour ask of me, Within my power to grant, and be refused.â Throw ope the aisle. (The Church-Warden opens the Aisle. They take the pall from the Coffin, in order to deposite it, and Moore sees the inscription.) Caroline!âO horror!â O say it is not so, I do conjure you! This is some snare for an unstable soulâ A hydra sight to wring the troubled mind And drive to utter madness.âAh! you weep! Then well may I.âBut my poor brain is seared Never to weep again.âO every sense Revolts from the dire tale I now must hear! Geo. Reproach from me thou hear'st not, nor from mine, Which I this time can quell; to thy own heart And conscience be it left.âHere lies the dust Of our loved sister, Caroline, who deem'd Herself thy spouse; and though thou brokest her heart, It was her last request she might be laid Here in thy vault, to save her memory. Moore. Can you all stand gazing on such a wretch, And not, with unity of feeling, rush And hurl him off from nature?âOh! in ruth, Plunge all your swords in this devoted breast, For such a hateful and detested thing Ne'er crawl'd upon the surface of the world, Fouling the elements with poison'd breath, And shaming the blest image of his Maker! If the earth open not and gorge me down Into its burning entrailsâif the bolt Sleep still in heaven, and stream not on this head, There is no eye that overlooks the world, Nor arm that can avenge the innocent.â Ah! I forget me!âDeath would now be mercy! 'Tis conscious existence is my bane!â O, Caroline! the heavens and earth shall strive In vain to sunder us.âIn that vault too With thee in death I'll lieâThou art my own, And thou diedst pure, my love, pure as an angel! Therefore the sacrifice I make is sweet.â No! I'll not lag behind thee! (Forcing off the lid.) I'll but take One last look of that form I loved so well, And of that face that I so oft have look'd on With raptures of delight; and then I'll prove To all the world how much I loved thee, Caroline. Calm and serenely sweet!âWho is it says That death is hideous?âOne look on that face Would make a thousand proselytes to this, That it is lovely.âThere was once a soul Of such benignant purity and love Lighted that heavenly face, that yet remain All the soft lines of beauty!âPardon me, Ye weeping friends! My soul clings to that dust, And I must reave one kiss from those dear lips; Pale though they be I love them! (He kisses the Corpse, then, after a solemn pause, starts.) Cecil. What moveth thee, thou frantic sufferer, That thou dost bend thine eyes upon the corse, And strain them so as if their orbs would burst From out their sockets?âHe is crazed, I ween, And verging into madness. Moore. 'Tis the illusion of my aching senses That mock and tantalize me.âI did think I saw those rose-leaves heave with earthly breath, And those cold eye-lids move.âYes, I am mad. Nor is it wonderful I should be so!â It was a strange delusion!âBut, alas! It was no more; for thou art cold and still, Dear saint, and soon shall this perturbed heart Be still as thine!âAdieu, my Caroline. This is the last!âI'll fold the dead robe up, And hide that wan but comely face for ever. (He starts with horror, and retires some paces.â Caroline sits up slowly in the Coffin, pulls a white Scarf from her face and breast, and appears in her bridal-robes, pale and quite insensible to all around her. As some of the objects begin to attract her eye, she shrinks down againâfeels for some time with her hands, and then, rising a second time, returns gradually to sensation.) Cecil. This sight so far transcends all human thought, That even surmise avoids it. Geo. Eternal God! but this is wonderful! I've heard that death hath yielded up his prey, In ages long agone, at the behest Of good men, and of Him who master'd it, But ween'd I e'er to see it!âNo!â This outdoes calculation!âIf 'tis done By the great Lord of life, in sympathy Of our deep woe, how ought we all to feel! Moore. I've learn'd of late to put discredit on My every sense, for they have baffled me; But sure I see those eyes, that late I saw Stedfast in death, now open to the day; And that pale cheek, that in the bier I kiss'd, Regaining fast the hues of virgin-rose; If this is an illusion, O, kind Heaven! I have but one request to make of theeâ Let it remain.âO, God! let it remain, Though but no longer than till I obtain One kind embrace from those dear arms, and hear Her speak my name once more in earthly tongue. Child of amazement, be thou phantasy, Spirit, or cold reanimated dust, Thou look'st so like my Caroline, that I Will raise thee up, and take thee to my heart. (Lifts her out of the Bier, and leads her forward.) My life, my wedded spouse, my Caroline, Dost thou not know me? Car. Hush!âI dare not speak.â I know not if this be a dreadful dream, Nor in what world I sojourn.âSure I heard The sound of my own voiceâand feel thine armâ What being art thou? And what dost thou here? Moore. Dost thou not know me, love?âAre all around Strangers to thee? Car. I know theeâthou art he Who did betray my wareless youth, and left me To misery and death.âArt thou alive?â Where am I?âWhere is Esther?âSpeak to meâ What does this mean?âThese monuments of death And weeds of woe, what do they all portend? And these wan moveless forms of friends beloved, What may they be? O speak to me. Moore. Speak on, speak on, fair vision, for thy voice Is music to my soul!âMove, breathe, and look; Give all thy vital functions exercise, Lest thou return into thy trance again; For O, I cannot yield thee back so soon To death, and to that narrow chilling urn! Yet I am thineâIn life or death I'm thine! 'Tis fix'd and absolute. Car. I gather nought from thisâAll, all is dark, Dark and uncertain! Geo. List me, my sister, but embrace me first; I'll speak with temperance.âDost thou remember The cot of Reldon?âof the farewell kiss Thou gavest me there?âThere did I close thine eyes In death, and there thy body was enshrined; And hither, at thy last request, was brought To Moore's own sepulchre. Him here we met Upon his way to bear thee home a bride, With all yon proud array.âIn agony He burst the lid from off thy funeral bier, And at his plaint of woe and burning kiss The dead awoke!âThe spirit, that had fled To its unearthly sanctuary, return'd, And renovated life dawn'd on thy face, Slowly and pale as opening morn of spring. Whither by latent searchless work of nature, Or the immediate influence of Heaven, He only knows who framed and rules them all; But never did event so wonderful, In these late ages, greet the eyes of men. Car. O I remember all; and trace it all In regular consequent.âBut never mind Shall fathom the dark depth, and the extent Of this strange miracle, but mine alone. Let never the most wretched soul despond, Doubting the guidance of th'Almighty arm, Or take that destiny in his erring hand That not to him belongs.âHe only knows The woes that he has borne, but little weens The fortune that awaits him.âWhen the cup Of bitterness seems to our eyes most full, 'Tis often nearest out.âO grant me now Thy blessing, honour'd sire! Cecil. Not as a MooreâNo!ânever!â Geo. My father, thou hast seen his poignant grief, And his exalted love.âLet me entreat thee To bless his union with thy Caroline, Thy child to thee so wondrously restored. Ralph. Though hitherto I've been a foe to Moore, I humbly now entreat thy acquiescence In this desired union. Moore. We all entreat thee. See, we all kneel to thee, and only wish To call thee father. Cecil. Give o'er thy mumbled pesterous requests, It may not be.âThe Moore hath rent my heart, And ruin'd me and mine.âI'll never yield To call him son. Moore. God is my witness, I never yet, by action or by word, Did aught against thy house, nor did I know Whence grew your deadly hate.âI loved you ever, And ever did respect you, as my friends, My bosom friends can witness. Collier, (who, during part of the foregoing Scene, has been standing behind.) Forgive, my lords, your lingering messenger: I see with wonder what I see; but farther Not now I questionâOn this theme I'll speak. Sir Anthony did ever pay respect And high regard to you.âThe knight is dead Who practised on your feelings, with effect To you pernicious. He it was who staid Your troops from battle, 'gainst the king's command, By which the realm was put in jeopardy, And he so much incensed; and every word Which in unguarded anger you have spoke, Have all been register'd, and to the king Sent with high aggravation.âMe he held So much his friend, and honour'd me with trust, I never could betray him, though my heart Abhorr'd his subtle plots.âThat this is truth, I'll make appeal to God, or proof to man. Cecil. Faucet!âAh, I bethink me! and I see At once the progress, and the moving cause Of our debasement. It was life to him This double-working cursed policy, So potent in the governance of things. Yet none of you could see it, but went on Brawling and scheming 'gainst the innocent! O ye're impediments to all that's great, Noble, or eminent!âYou'll carp and breed Great coil at fault or failing of old age; But you lack that; the source of high remead; Both of you lack itâ'tis not here in either! For thee, my child, my loved, and wronged child, Thou never gavest offenceâMy love for thee Was well requited.â (Embracing Caroline.) Though I have misconstrued Of you, sir, here the blame attaches not. (Taking his hand kindly, and joining it with Caroline's. May you be blest as father's heart can wish. The blame was not with meâ'Twas theyâ'Twas they. (He strides off deeply affectedâThey all embrace âCurtain drops.</field>
