      <field name="fulltext">OCTAVIA. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Nero. Seneca. Tigellinus. Octavia. PoppÃ¦a.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Palace of Nero in Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Nero, Seneca. Sen. Lord of the world, what dost thou covet? Ne. Peace. Sen. 'Tis thine, if thou destroy'st it not in others. Ne. I should possess it fully, if I were not Bound to Octavia by a hated tie. Sen. But thou, the CÃ¦sar's successor, couldst thou Inherit and increase their power and lustre Without Octavia's hand? 'Twas by her means That thou enjoyest this throne: yet in a hard And unjust exile, this Octavia pines; She, though thus robb'd of thee, although she knows A haughty rival clasps thee in her arms, (Unhappy lady!) loves, adores thee yet. Ne. Grant that she were the instrument to raise me, She since has proved the instrument alone Of my misfortunes; and e'en now, alas! Since her divorce, her baneful influence reigns. The faithless people dare espouse her cause, Dare speak of her with pity? dare, oh rage! Around my very throne to breathe their murmurs?â I would not only that Octavia's name Were never loudly thunder'd in my ears, But that no trembling lip in timid whispers Scarce audibly dared mutter it around me.â âI am not Nero if I suffer this. Sen. My lord, thou hast not always in contempt My councils held. Thou knowest well how I Boldly, with weapons of sage argument, Have check'd the ardour of thy youthful passions. I threatened thee with shame, reproach, and mischief, If thou persisted'st to divorce Octavia, And from her cruel banishment still worse. Octavia's image is devoutly cherish'd In the recesses of the people's hearts: I told thee this: and added that all Rome Accounted as ill-omen'd gifts the fields Of Plautus, and the bloody house of Burrhus, On her so cruelly expelled, bestowed, In the esteem of all men, as the types Of predetermined outrage: and I said ... Ne. Amply hast thou exhorted me; but yet Thou hast obeyed my will. Perhaps formerly Thou taughted'st me to reign; but neither thou Canst teach, nor man can learn, to be exempt Always from error. Let it now suffice me, That Rome has given me a timely warning. 'Twas no light fault that I expell'd Octavia, For never should she have, no never long, A dwelling far from me ... Sen. Thou then of this Repentest? and 'tis true what I have heard? Octavia returns? Ne. Yes. Sen. Thou dost feel Pity for her? Ne. Pity? ... yes; I feel pity. Sen. And she will be companion of thy throne, Perhaps of thy royal bed? Ne. Within my palace She now returns. Wherefore, thou wilt behold. Oh Seneca, thou wise among the wisest, In manifold emergencies of state More urgent and more difficult than this, My guide and minister, I flatter me Thou wilt not now deceive the implicit trust That I have placed in thee. Sen. Counsel from me, Alas! 'tis ever thus! thou only seekest, When in thy heart thou hast already fix'd The fatal sentence. I guess not thy thoughts; But for Octavia, hearing thee speak thus, I tremble. Ne. Tell me, didst thou also tremble That day when, dragg'd to necessary death, Her brother fell? And on that day when thou Didst with thy lips pronounce my haughty mother, Who was become thy foe, worthy of death, Say, didst thou tremble? Sen. What is this I hear? That infamous, that execrable day Dar'st thou recall to mind? My hands were not Bathed in that blood of thine; thou drankest it, I held my peace; constrain'd, I held my peace, 'Tis true; but from my silence I was guilty, And shall be while the vital air I breathe. Fool that I was! I trusted to thee then, That Nero thus would with maternal blood Close his career of blood. Now I perceive This scarce was a beginning. Each renewal Of thy dire deeds to me brings tribute large Of hated gifts, with which, I know not why, Thou hast o'erwhelm'd me. Thou constrainest me To take them; price of blood thy gifts wilt seem To the malignant people: ah! resume them; And leave to me my self-esteem entire. Ne. If thou possessest it, to thee I leave it. Thou art expert in all the milder virtues: But thou art aware, however plausible, These virtues are not always fit for practice. If thou didst wish to keep thy fame untouch'd, And incorrupt thy heart, why didst thou quit, For this alluring splendour of a court, Thy obscure birth-place? Thus thou seest that I, Myself no stoic, can teach thee who art; And yet my wisdom I owe all to thee. Since by thy station here thou hast thyself Impaired thy candour; since the name of good, When tarnished once, can never be regain'd, Thou mayest assist me. Of my former faults Thou hast diminish'd, or wiped off, the foulness; Proceed; applaud and varnish o'er my failings; Thy judgment yet is held in some esteem. Less criminal than other men, the people Esteem thee yet; thou always art supposed Over my heart great influence to possess: In short, thou'rt so install'd within my palace, That when thou blamest me, thou blam'st thyself. Sen. I know it pleases thee that other men Should bear the burthen of thy trespasses. A load divided thus becomes more light. Yes, I, though guiltless of thy numerous crimes, Bear all their punishment; and thus incur That royal privilegeâuniversal hate. What infamous new task canst thou impose On me that can increase ... Ne. Thou art required To alienate the people from Octavia. Sen. The people change not, as their masters do, Their partialities; and ill they feign. Ne. The wise man shapes his language and his deeds To the occasion: and art thou not wise? Go; on that day I shall avail myself Of all thy virtues, whatsoe'er they be, When I can say the empire is my own. Meanwhile I am the master of the art, And thou the pupil, to obtain that power: See that I find thee pliant to my purpose. I do not menace thee with death; I know That death appals thee not; but of thy fame The small remains with which thou yet art burthen'd, Ah think, 'tis all at my supreme disposal. I can take from thee more than thou possessest. Be silent then, and aid my purposes. Sen. Absolute words I hear, and words that breathe Rancour and blood. But I wait the event, Whatever it may be. To thy designs All my assistance now is vain and guilty. Who is not well convinced that Nero now Suffices unassisted to shed blood? SCENE THE SECOND. Nero. Ne. Thee and thy pomp of simulated virtues, Proud stoic, I will quell. Till now with gifts I have contrived to punish thee: I keep The axe to fall upon thy abject neck When to the very refuse of the people I've render'd thee contemptible. What now Is this my absolute tremendous power, If on all quarters it is thwarted thus With fresh impediments? I hate Octavia; PoppÃ¦a I adore beyond all words; And shall I stoop, I, to dissimulate Aversion and regard? That privilege Which to my vilest slaves the law forbids not, Shall the envious whispers of the multitude Attempt to-day to interdict to Nero? SCENE THE THIRD. Nero, PoppÃ¦a. Pop. Mightiest of monarchs, source of all my joy, Opprest with care, and banish'd from my sight, Thou leavest me to bitter anguish. What, Shall it ne'er be that I shall witness thee Blest by our mutual love? Ne. I, far from thee, Am sometimes banish'd by our love, PoppÃ¦a, And by our love alone. Thee I secured With long and perilous toil; to keep thee now I should assiduously strive: thou knowest, That even at my very sceptre's risk, I will that thou be mine ... Pop. Except thyself, Who would, who could dissever me from thee? Each nod of thine, each will of thine, in Rome, Is law supreme. Thou, as a recompence Of my regard, bestow'dst thyself on me, And thou from me may'st take thyself away; And as thou canst effectively do this, So could I ne'er survive the loss of thee. Ne. Take thee from me! Not heaven itself could do it. But guilty popular insolence, not yet Utterly smother'd, dares meanwhile to blame The affections of my heart: hence I'm constrain'd To take preventive measures ... Pop. And dost thou That popular insolence heed? Ne. I hope, ere long, To shew how much I heed it; but I fain Would leave without a head this frantic hydra: Scarce will its last head tumble on the ground, Whence Rome derives her hope, ere broken, mute, Torn, and annihilate, to earth will fall Her haughty multitudes. Rome has not yet Discover'd Nero's heart; I from her thoughts Her fond traditionary tales of freedom Will utterly expel. Octavia, now The last survivor of the Claudii, Resounds in every mouth; the multitude, In my despite, deplores her destiny, Not from affection; in the people's heart Love never enters: but the insolence Of popular licentiousness it sooths To recollect the weak and infirm sway Of inept Claudius, and to sigh for that Perversely, which no more they can possess. Pop. 'Tis true: the tongues of Rome can ne'er be silent; But have they any power except to prate? Should this alarm thee? Ne. For Octavia A too auspicious place of banishment Incautiously I've chosen. For the name Of Agrippina, the entire armament Now station'd on Campania's shores, retains A partial recollection. In their breasts Desire of novelty, a specious pity For Claudius' daughter, disaffected thoughts, And traitrous purposes, have taken root. I have ill-chosen such a place of exile; And should do worse in suffering her to stay there. Pop. And should Octavia in thy mind excite Such keen solicitude? Why not dispatch her Beyond the confines of thy mighty empire? What exile more effectual than this, If that indeed suffice? What trackless desert Is so remote that it can sever her Too far from thee, preposterously who dares To attribute to herself the foolish boast Of giving thee the throne? Ne. Till she has lost, Entirely lost, the power to injure me, In Rome, and in my palace, she will have A residence least perilous for me. Pop. What do I hear? Octavia come to Rome! Ne. Now hear my arguments. Pop. Am I then she? ... Ne. Ah! hear me ... Pop. Yes, full well I understand; ... Quickly must I depart ... Ne. Listen to me: Octavia doth not to thy detriment Return to Rome: but surely to her own ... Pop. That she returns there to thy detriment, Quickly wilt thou behold. Meanwhile I tell thee That not one city, much less then one palace, While we are living, can at once contain Octavia and myself. Let her return That seated Nero on the world's proud throne; To make him abdicate that throne she comes. For thee I grieve, not for myself, ah no; I am most willing to return once more To my beloved Otho. Much he loved me, And with no lukewarm fondness loves me still: Ah that I could contrive to love again That so devoted lover! But PoppÃ¦a Her heart could ne'er divide; nor would accept Thy heart divided with her hated rival. I was enamour'd of thyself alone, Not of thy throne, and still, alas! I am: The love, not of the monarch of the world, But of my much-loved Nero, was to me An irresistible enticement: then If but in part thou tak'st thyself from me, If undividedly I do not reign In thy great heart, I yield the whole, I yield And spurn at all the rest. Alas! could I Tear as effectively from my fond heart Thy form, as I'm inflexibly resolved On total alienation from thy presence. Ne. PoppÃ¦a, I adore thee, this thou knowest; With what affection, that which I have done, And that which I design to do, will prove. But thou ... Pop. What wouldst thou? Can I at thy side Behold that odious rival, and remain there? Can I admit the thought? Unworthy lady! Who knows not how, who will not, cannot love, And yet dare feign to love. Ne. Ah tranquillize Thy mind, thy heart; banish each jealous fear. But yet respect my sovereign will. 'Tis now Impossible that she should not return. Already she towards Rome advances: here To-morrow will behold her. Thy repose Not less than mine demands Octavia's presence. But why enumerate reasons if I wish it? I, not accustomed, if my will is fixed, To meet with obstacles. Believe me, lady, I am not satisfied with such a love As thou displayest, of all fear exempt. Who most obey and fear me, know that they Love me the best. Pop. Alas! my very boldness Proceeds from the intensity of fear. Oh how much may'st thou injure me! Thy love Thou may'st withdraw fro me ... Ah! rather first Take thou my life: that punishment were milder. Ne. PoppÃ¦a, cease; confide in my affection. Doubt never of my faith; above all things Fear to oppose my will. E'en more than thou, Her, whom thou call'st thy rival, I detest. Completely sever'd from her turbulent friends, Thou here shalt see her by my guards surrounded, No more thy rival, but thy abject handmaid. And, finally, if I have any skill In arts of ruling, she herself shall give thee Over herself the entire ascendency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. PoppÃ¦a, Tigellinus. Pop. To-day a common danger we incur; Oh Tigellinus, it behoves us then, To-day, to seek a common remedy. Ti. And what? Fear'st thou Octavia? ... Pop. Certainly Not her allurements; hitherto have mine Prevail'd in Nero's eyes: I apprehend Her feign'd affection, her feign'd gentleness; The arts of Seneca, and his reproaches, The violence of the people, the remorse Of Nero; these I fear. Ti. Long has he loved thee, And dost thou not yet know him? His remorse Springs from an incapacity to injure. Believe me now, 'tis but to consummate A more complete revenge, that he to Rome Thus draws Octavia. Let it work in him That innate rancour, fathomless and bitter; This, added to the inveterate abhorrence His fruitless bed inspired; these are alone The sure preventives to our common danger. Pop. Feel'st thou secure? Not I.âBut thy frank converse Induces me to speak. I know full well The soul of Nero; of compunctious workings It is not capable: but terror, say, Is terror not omnipotent in him? Who did not see him tremble at the sight Of his detested mother? Was he not Wholly possest with love for me; yet dared he, While she was living, give to me his hand? By the mere sternness of his silent scowl Did not e'en Burrhus awe him? Finally, Of all power destitute, and garrulous, Does Seneca sometimes not even yet Affright him with his magisterial prate? These are the mirrors, whose reflection forms The semblance of a conscience. The remorse Is this, of which I think him capable. Now add to these the uproar of the rabble, The menaces of Rome ... Ti. These will consign Octavia more quickly to the fate Which fell on Agrippina and on Burrhus, To which so many, many more were doom'd. Suffer that to his ancient enmity Fresh fears be added, in a breast like his, T'inspire the wish, and lastly to mature it, For the destruction of thy rival. He Has not discover'd yet to me his thoughts, But I'm aware that nothing sharpens more Nero's fierce cunning than his boundless fear. Rome, clamorous for Octavia, kills Octavia. Pop. Yes; but meanwhile Octavia may usurp A transient glimmering of capricious favour? Octavia hates us both: what would defend thee From such effective wrath? Th'irresolute, And frail reluctance of a trembling lord? One untoward instant may alone suffice To o'erwhelm us both; what consolation then To us, if we are doom'd to fall the first, That she fall after us? Ti. Fear not, oh no! That she secure e'en a brief flash of favour. The way to Nero's heart Octavia knows not. Her weak parade of austere virtue frets him; Obedience, love, timidity, in her, Alike displease him; and that very bait With which by us he's caught, in her he hates. But yet, if I can any thing perform, What ought I now to do? Pop. Sagaciously Explore, and warn me of, the smallest trifles; Exert keen foresight; to his rage bring fuel; Invent contrivances, propose to Nero A thousand, for the ruin of my rival; Tax her with faults where she has none: in short, As far as thy dexterity suggests, Apply a thousand means; go, come, assail him, Work on his passions, blind them; and watch always:â This shouldst thou do. Ti. This will I do: fear not: But the best instrument for such effects Is Nero's own dark heart; he in the lore Of vengeance is a master; and, thou knowest, If others shew in this an equal skill, He is incensed. Pop. That all conspires to inflame His rage, I know full well. With my excess Of love erewhile he reprimanded me; And spoke to me already of the throne Like a ferocious despot. Ti. Take thou heed Not to provoke him ever: o'er his heart Thy power is great; but impulses of rage, Intoxication of supreme command, And a fierce thirst of vengeance, can controul, Far more than love, the workings of his heart. Depart: he wished to speak with me alone In these apartments: all thy interests Implicitly confide to Tigellinus. Pop. I swear to thee, that, if in this thou serv'st me, None that approach the person of the emperor, Shall equal thee in power and confidence. SCENE THE SECOND. Tigellinus. Ti. 'Tis certain, if Octavia triumph'd now, That fatal injury would result to us. Nero himself assures me. Too intense Is his disdain; Octavia's innocence Too manifest; no refuge has she left. Yet I'm constrain'd to summon up to-day All my dexterity. I must persuade him That all his fear is provident precaution; And make him fancy that the guiltiest vengeance Would be pronounced, even by sages, just. Lord of the world, I hold thee; I alone Hold thee, and absolutely. To myself Shall it belong, in time, t'intimidate And to encourage thee. Woe, if thou lose This salutary fear! To evil deeds, What further impulse, or to virtuous deeds, What further hindrance would remain to thee? SCENE THE THIRD. Nero, Tigellinus. Ti. Great emperor, why didst thou not come before? Thou wouldst have heard the sobbings of a lady, Who loves thee too intensely. In the bosom, The true and tender bosom of PoppÃ¦a, A conflict fierce, doubt, fear, and love, have waged. A lady who adores thee so, canst thou Thus cruelly afflict? Ne. She will not see, Blinded by unjust jealousy, the truth. I love her only ... Ti. This I've said to her; But who could better calm the bitter pangs Of jealous fear than a beloved lover? From her, ah hide, in pity to her sex, That terrible majesty, that in thy face Conspicuous shines. Thou with a word, a smile, A look, couldst calm the tempest that assails Her trembling heart. I, in thy name, have dared To swear to her, that in thyself the thought Hath never entered to abandon her. That, though I know them not, for mighty reasons, Thou summonedest Octavia to Rome; But never to PoppÃ¦a's detriment. Ne. My faithfullest interpreter, for me The truth thou swaredst. This I also swore To her: but deaf she stood. What avail words? The day that rises, will, perchance, scarce be Completed, ere Octavia's destiny Shall be, and irrecoverably, seal'd. Ti. May all thy cares be wound up in her fate, Provided thou wouldst condescend to prove How criminal she is to Rome. Ne. To Rome? As guilty as 'tis possible to be Is she, since I abhor her. Is it needful That I by proofs legitimate my will? Ti. 'Tis but too needful. Thou canst not yet hold The impious multitude in the contempt Which it deserves. 'Tis true, it held its peace At Agrippina's and at Claudius' pyres: That of Britannicus it saw in silence: Yet at Octavia's fate it dares to-day Murmur and weep. Reveal Octavia's crimes, And all men will be mute. Ne. I never loved her; She evermore displeased and wearied me; She had the boldness to lament her brother; I saw her too implicitly obey The turbulent Agrippina: oft to me I heard her name her sceptred ancestors: These are atrocious crimes, and they suffice. On her already have I sentence passed: To execute it there is nothing wanting Except her presence. That she is no more Rome shall discover: this is the account Which of my purpose I shall give to Rome. Ti. Emperor, thou mak'st me tremble for thyself. It is not prudent in thee thus to brave The boisterous people. If thou canst on her With justice death inflict, why wouldst thou now That she of thy despotic will alone Should seem the victim? Were it not more wise Of her authentic crimes to drag to light The most enormous? As she is, in fact, To prove her guilty, while she is esteemed Reproachless? Ne. Other ... more enormous ... crimes? Ti. No man presumed to mention them to thee: But should they be concealed from thee, since now She is, by her legitimate divorce, No more thy consort? The unworthy lady Yet held her station in thy court; with thee Yet shared thy bed and throne; and yet usurp'd The homage due to an imperial princess; When lower than the most abandon'd woman She had herself degraded; when, alas! She had conceived the thought to prostitute To a vile minstrel, that had caught her eye, Her noble blood, her honour, and herself, And her imperial ancestors ... Ne. Oh infamy! Ti. The slave Eucerus pleased her: hence she bore Her banishment from Rome, and her divorce, With so much resignation. He sufficed Amply to compensate for Nero's loss; Companion, and inseparable solace, He, of her exile was; ... why call it exile? The soft Campania, exquisite retreat, In their voluptuous wallowings shelter'd them. There on the flowery turf, or on the brink Of crystal stream, she listened to the notes Now drawn in symphony from the sweet lyre By his effeminate hand, in concert now To his melodious voice: hence she resign'd The dazzling splendour of her former state Without regretful thoughts. Ne. Could she belie The blood of Messalina, who her birth From her derived?âNow say; could proofs be brought To certify the deed? Ti. Yes; to this fact Are more than one of her attendants privy; And, if appeal'd to, would depose the truth. If e'er Octavia had possess'd thy love, I ne'er had spoken thus. What do I say? Had she possess'd, had she deserved thy heart, Such an offence she ne'er could have imagined, Much less have perpetrated. To thy arms, Reasons of state, in spite of thy dislike, At first consigned her. Well she knew herself Of thee unworthy; hence her abject heart Thus abjectly she fix'd. Ne. But yet I fear That were I now to opprobrious light to drag This obscure crime ... Ti. Their's is the infamy Who did the crime. Ne. 'Tis true. Ti. Thus their deserts Will all obtain: she that of culpable; Thou that of just; and so thou mayest be Without incurring risk. Ne. Thou speakest wisely. Be bold in deeds as thou art wise in words. SCENE THE FOURTH. Seneca, Nero, Tigellinus. Sen. Emperor, already hath Octavia passed Thy royal threshold: whether I to thee Bring unpropitious or propitious news, I cannot tell. But no one emulous Of such a task, anticipates my coming: A luckless omen this. Ne. Go, Tigellinus; My orders execute:âand thou retrace Thy previous footsteps; meet Octavia, tell her That I await her coming here alone. SCENE THE FIFTH. Nero. Ne. Guilty, and greatly guilty, is Octavia; What doubt is there of that? I grieve alone That I suggested not this project first Thus to convict her. Can it then be soâ That Nero should from others learn the art To crush an enemy? But the day comes When to get rid of those that I abhor, A signal from my throne will be sufficient. SCENE THE SIXTH. Nero, Octavia. Oct. In the deep horrors of a gloomy night By armed guards surrounded, I am dragged Into this very palace, whence I saw Myself, two months ago, by violence torn. May I presume now of my lord to ask The cause of this? Ne. For lofty purposes Our parents joined us in connubial ties From our most tender years. Yet since that time I never saw thee, as thou wert in words, Conformable in actions to my will: For a long time thy contumely I bore; And should, perchance, have borne it longer, hadst thou Made me the father of a royal offspring, Numerous and lovely; in whose cheering presence I might have found some solace to my cares. I hoped for this in vain; a sterile plant By thee the throne remain'd devoid of heirs; By thee my hopes of being a father cross'd. Hence I divorced thee. Oct. Emperor, thou didst well; Provided that another happier consort Than I, alas! e'er was, could render thee The joyful father of a numerous offspring. I know thou hast not found, nor e'er wilt find, One that, as I love, loves thee. What of this? Have I perchance e'er murmur'd at thy will? Seeing my husband in another's arms, I've wept, and still I weep. Except my tears And silence, and obsequiousness and sighs, Has aught been heard from me? Ne. Perpetual sweetness Dwells on thy lips; but not within thy heart. Thy words betray thy rancour: ill thou hidest The anger thou conceivest in thy breast Against PoppÃ¦a. And far less hast thou Concealed thy other proud remembrances Of unauthentic rights. Oct. Ah, couldest thou Also forget, as much as I forget These not imaginary rights of mine, Since no imaginary ills they cost me! ... Hatred and fury glisten in thy eyes. Ah! I too plainly see that thou dost hate me, More vehemently hate me, than a husband From mere sterility could hate a wife. Unhappy lady that I am! I most, When most I love thee, have offended thee. What have I asked of thee? What ask I now? An obscure and a solitary life, And liberty to weep. Ne. And I, indeed, Assured that thou wouldst in an obscure life Be better satisfied, to thee prescribed The life; but afterwards ... Oct. But afterwards Thou didst repent of this: didst feel remorse Since I was not sufficiently unhappy. Thou wishest me to live a witness here Of thy new ties: thou wishest me to be The handmaid of thy consort; to the world A laughing-stock; derision of thy court. Behold me then submissive to thy will: What should I do? Speak. Issue thy commands. Yet even in thy court entirely wretched Thou canst not make me, if with my misfortunes I satisfy thy heart. Say, art thou happy? Reigns in thy heart a placid calm? Dost thou Beside another spouse that tranquil sleep, Of which thou robbest me, securely taste? Does that PoppÃ¦a, whom, like me, thou hast not Robbed of a brother, more than did Octavia Ensure thy happiness? Ne. At what a price Thou ought'st to hold his heart who rules the world, Thou never knewest, and PoppÃ¦a knows. Oct. PoppÃ¦a knows how to esteem the throne To which she was not born: I to esteem Thyself: nor can she ever try to cope With me in loving thee. She has, 'tis true, Obtain'd thy heart; but I alone deserve it. Ne. No, no, thou canst not love me. Oct. Rather say, That I ought not to love thee: but from thine Judge not thou of my heart. I know, that now The blood from which I spring, except in me, Is everlastingly extinct; I know That in my heart, thy image, with the blood Of all my family contaminate, Ought never to have found a place: but this Is force of destiny. Now, if my brother, My father, slain by thee, I ne'er remember, Dar'st thou allege against me as a crime That brother and that father? Ne. As a crime, The vile Eucerus I allege against thee. Oct. To me? ... Eucerus! Ne. Yes; to thee Eucerus; The lover thou deservest. Oct. Ah, just Heaven! Dost thou hear this? Ne. There are who dare to charge thee As guilty of adulterous servile love: For this alone I bring thee back to Rome. Prepare thyself for which thou likest best, Or to refute it, or to suffer for it. Oct. Oh unexampled, horrible imposture! Where is the infamous accuser? ... Ah ... Fool that I am, what questions do I ask? Nero accuses, judges, and condemns. Ne. Behold thy boasted love! ... Yes, yes, the poison At last flows freely from thy bursting heart; Now that I have, at least in part, discover'd Thy secret turpitude. Oct. Ah wretched me! ... What more remains for me? Driven from my bed, My throne, my palace, and my country; this Suffices not! ... Oh Heaven! my fame alone Remain'd to me entire; alone consoled me For every ravish'd good: this precious treasure In vain, by her who lightly prized her own, Was seen with envy: now or ere my life, My fading life is gone, my fame is tarnished. Haste, haste, oh Nero, why dost thou delay? Peace, (if that blessing ever can be thine,) Peace, I know well, thou never wilt enjoy So long as I exist: can the means fail thee To slay a helpless and a friendless lady? Within the deep recesses of this palace, The fatal dark abode of fraud and death, Drag me at will: and let me there be slain. Moreover, thou thyself may'st with thy hands Cut short my life: not only will my death Please thee, but it is necessary now. Ah be appeased then with my death alone. All other slaughter of my friends already I have forgiven thee; I now forgive The slaughter of myself; yes, kill, reign on, And kill again: thou know'st all means of death; Already Rome is skilful in the art Of blazoning forth thy crimes in virtues' symbols; What dost thou fear? In me of all the Claudii The last survivor dies; all the remembrance, And all the love the people ever bore them. The gods are now accustomed to the fumes Of thy ensanguined incense; at their altars Still the memorials hang of every death: And private massacres have been to thee As trophies and as triumphs. Let my death Suffice then to appease thee: why allege, When death I do not shun, nay ask of thee, Aspersions as iniquitous as false? Ne. For thy defence I wholly yield to thee This dawning day. If thou art innocent 'Twill give me joy. My hate thou need'st not fear, But thy own crime, which far surpasses it. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Octavia. Oct. Ah wretched me! ... Ah cruel Nero, fed, For ever fed with blood, yet always craving.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Octavia, Seneca. Oct. Oh Seneca, approach; let me at least Shed tears with thee: hard lot! I find not one, Not one to pity, and to weep with me. Sen. Lady, and is it true? This infamous And lying accusation ... Oct. Save this last Dire outrage, all from Nero I expected; And this alone increases all my suffering. Sen. Were ever folly and atrocity So mingled in fatuity of guilt? Thou paragon of innocence and faith, Thou modest, gentle, and compassionate, Thou, though accustomed to consort with Nero, Pure and unspotted: shalt thou of thy fame Be thus despoil'd? Oh no, it shall not be! I yet exist, the living evidence Of all thy virtue; Rome shall hear me yet Proclaim thee innocent with my last breath: What heart so hard as not to pity thee? Ah! tell me not (what words can ill express) How bitter are thy tears: I feel it all, And share thy grief. Oct. But thou dost hope in vain. Nothing, till he has robb'd me of my fame, Does Nero deem that he has taken from me. All at his mercy lies: thyself wouldst share Ruin, and all in vain: ah! thou indeed Makest me tremble for thyself. But yet Thy fame beyond the reach of man is placed By a long series of virtuous deeds: Ah, were it so with mine! ... But young, a woman, In a flagitious court brought up, oh Heaven! Guilty I may be deemed of shameful crimes. The world believes not, nor should it believe, That I preserve a love for Nero still: Yet though a thousand times in thousand forms He has infix'd the dagger in my breast, Still is the seeing that he loves another The grief surpassing every other grief. Sen. Nero still spares my life: I know not why; Nor do I know what destiny of mine Withdraws me from the track that Burrhus trod, And a few others eminent for virtue, That he has slain. Yet Nero, though he spare, Has not yet cancell'd from his book of death My proscribed name. Already had my hand Cut the precarious thread of my frail life, Had not the hope restrain'd me (ah deceived, And scarce remaining hope!) that I one day Might reconduct him to the path of virtue. Yet, at the risk of this poor span of life, At least I hope to rescue from his hand Some innocent. Ah, mightest thou be she! Oh might I spare thee infamy at least! Having done this, oh, how exultingly Should I expire! Oct. At once I laid aside All thoughts of life when I these thresholds pass'd. Not that I fear not death; whence should I gain Such strength of mind? 'Tis true, I fear to die: And yet I wish it; and, with anxious thought, I turn to thee, thou master in the science. Sen. Ah! ... think ... Thou tear'st my heart ... Oct. Thou canst alone Deliver me; from infamy at least ... Infamy! now thou seest whence it falls On me: PoppÃ¦a dares impute to me The most disgraceful love. Sen. Oh worthy spouse Of cruel Nero! Oct. Virtue certainly Does not enamour him: audacious, free, And overbearing manners, act on him, At once, as an incentive and a yoke: Tenderness wearies him. What have I not done To please him? I respected, as a law, His smallest intimation; and held sacred His every wish. Clandestinely I wept My murdered brother; for that act of his, If from my lips Nero obtain'd no praise, Censure he never heard. I wept in silence; And feign'd to think him guiltless of that blood: But to no purpose: 'twas my cruel fate, Whatever I attempted, to displease him. Sen. Could Nero ever love thee if thou wert not Impious and cruel? Calm thyself a little. The day now dawns. Soon as the multitude Of thy return shall hear, 'twill wish to see thee, And give thee proofs of its entire attachment. From it I draw much hope; at thy departure Its outcries were most turbulent; nor ceased During thy absence discontented whispers. Greatly depraved, but still more greatly fearful, All that he would do, Nero dare not do. He fears the people. Fierce and proud he is; Yet hitherto the throne beneath him totters: And perhaps one day ... Oct. What noise is this I hear? Sen. Methinks the people ... Oct. They approach the palace ... Oh heavens! Sen. The cries of an insurgent people I seem to hear. Oct. What will become of us? Sen. What fearest thou? We are the only persons That in this horrible palace need not tremble ... Oct. Louder and louder does the tumult swell. Ah wretched me! Perhaps Nero is in danger ... But who do I behold? Sen. Nero; he comes. Oct. In his ferocious and ensanguined eyes, Oh! with what rage he burns!âI tremble ... SCENE THE SECOND. Nero, Octavia, Seneca. Ne. Who, Perfidious woman, who art thou, that thus All Rome is up in arms at thy return, And dares to shout thy name? What dost thou here? What plottest thou with that pernicious traitor? Ye both are in my power. The foolish people In vain demands to see thee. Ah! I hope, At least, if I am forced to it, as thou Deservest to be shewn, to shew thee dead. Oct. Dispose of me, oh Nero, as thou wilt. But of each popular commotion, ah! Believe that I am innocent. I ask, (I swear to thee) I neither ask, nor hope, Aught from the people's love: in spite of me, When it might injure thee, do thou prevent Th'involuntary error by my death. Ne. I would that every one, or ere thou'rt punished, Should know thee as thou art, a malefactor. Sen. And dost thou hope the people to deceive With such a base untruth? Ne. Thou also, thou, Thou cowardly fomenter of disturbance, Which thou thyself avoidest; occult source Of these rebellious movements; thou shalt be Ere long the puny victim of my vengeance. SCENE THE THIRD. Nero, Octavia, Tigellinus, Seneca. Ti. Emperor ... Ne. What bring'st thou, Tigellinus? speak. Ti. More and more fervently the tempest rages: Thy judgment must apply the remedy. Scarce heard the people that a sovereign mandate Recall'd Octavia to Rome, than each Is emulous to see her. Foolishly They deem that thou hast changed thy first resolve: And there are who assert that thou again Hast in thy bed received her. Wild with joy, These in the capitol prefer their vows; On the neglected statues of Octavia Those replace chaplets of triumphal laurel: Others, with transport drunk, dare to cast down Those of PoppÃ¦a; their audacity So far has risen, that, 'mid cries and shouts, Dragg'd in the dust and filth indignantly, Broken they lie. With epithets of scorn They execrate her name: and to the skies, Nero, with acclamations loud, extol: The greater part demands PoppÃ¦a's exile; And some more cruel imprecate her death. Triumphant hymns, and threatenings, thou wilt hear; Then prayers and threats again, and prayers once more. Each bosom burns: authority is fled. The soldiers and commanders tried to stem The irresistible, impetuous torrent; In vain they tried; a moment saw them all Confused, dispersed, discomfited, or slain. What shall we do? What is thy sovereign will? Ne. What shall we do? ... The people must behold This their Octavia:âLet her then be slain. Oct. See my defenceless bosom: if it please thee Slay me at once. Ah, may my blood appease thee. Shew me to th'inflamed multitude when dead: Thou wilt at once, by doing this, repress All culpable rejoicing. Let the urn, This is my sole request, receive my relics, That holds the ashes of Britannicus. So may thy throne find in our monument A sacred and an everlasting base. Why dost thou now delay? receive my life; I owe it to thy fury. Sen. If at once Thou wouldst to-day both lose thy throne and life, Certain the method is: Octavia slay. Ne. At all events on her I would take vengeance. Oct. Not only one death, I would have a thousand, Ere the least detriment I caused to Nero. Ti. But the time presses more and more. Hear'st thou Those savage howlings? I have never seen So furious an attack; and so much less Surmountable, as 'tis th'effect of joy. 'Tis needful to decide. Oct. Can it be doubtful? Nero, henceforward, to prevent all tumult, 'Tis indispensable to slay or love me. The one, thou couldst not even feign to do; The other, for a long time thou hast wished: Let courage crown thy wish; slay me; be bold: Or if this be not the propitious moment For such decision, temporize awhile; Thou easily may'st do it. Credulous The people are, and if their sudden movements Be from their channel turn'd, their force is lost. This will be easy; 'twill alone suffice That I with placid looks present myself, As in thy favour I were reinstated; That I but feign that I am thine. The crowd Will thus be soon dispersed; all tumult quell'd. Thus to unsheathe thy sword wilt thou gain time, And to destroy thy victims. Ne. Yes, to Rome Will I present thee: but first will discover Whether I am in Rome the real master. Thou, Tigellinus, to the camp repair; Silently the pretorian bands assemble; Thence with a terrible, unexpected force, On the refractory fall; and by the death Of whomsoe'er thou meetest mark thy steps. Ti. I will attempt it; though the consequence Be most precarious. 'Twill, indeed, appear A harsh expedient to repress with swords A sudden gust of joy. And should it turn To indignation? brief is the transition. 'Tis no light task to cope with a whole city: Suppose that with my partisans I fall; Who then remains in thy defence? Ne. 'Tis true ... But yet to yield would seem ... Ti. Now trust to me: Do not incur a mighty danger lightly: Thy single presence might perchance at once Disperse them all. Ne. The guardian of Octavia I remain here. In my name do thou go, Shew thyself to them: what the people are Thou knowest well; to temporize with them Will be the worst. At thy discretion feign, Grant, promise, cheat, destroy, and put in practice Gold, terror, weapons, flattery, menaces, So that they be o'ercome. Go, fly, return. SCENE THE FOURTH. Nero, Octavia, Seneca. Ne. Woe on thee, Seneca, if from this palace Thou dost attempt to stir! but keep thyself Out of my sight, let my eyes never see thee. Meanwhile prefer at will nefarious vows; Hope and desire; thy day of retribution Also approaches quickly. Sen. I expect it. SCENE THE FIFTH. Nero, Octavia. Ne. And thou, Octavia, this thy final triumph Fully enjoy; for soon ... Oct. The day, too late, Will also come when thou wilt know Octavia. SCENE THE SIXTH. PoppÃ¦a, Nero, Octavia. Pop. Say, Nero, hat thou placed me at thy side, And on thy throne, that I should be the scorn, The laughing-stock of thy audacious people? But what do I behold? while I am thus The victim of derision, unavenged, Irresolute, and silent dost thou stand In presence of the author of thy wrongs? In truth, fit master of the world is Nero! Yet notwithstanding does the multitude Prefer his wife to him. Oct. Thou hast alone The heart of Nero: what dost thou then fear? I, a vile prisoner, I the hostage am Of the audacious people's wavering faith. Do thou rejoice: soon as all things are calm, The transient wounds of thy ambitious heart Will find a sovereign balsam in my blood. Ne. Soon will thy shameful deeds be brought to light; The paltry idol Rome will soon behold Which for herself she raised. Thy outrages, PoppÃ¦a, will to honour be ascribed; Her honours only to her infamy. Oct. And if there are who could convict Octavia, By fair and open proofs, of infamy, I have already in my secret heart Chosen PoppÃ¦a as my only judge; To thee do I appeal. Thou knowest well What criminality it is to change The affections of the heart, what punishment Those who are guilty of the crime deserve. But I am innocent, alas! too much so, E'en in your eyes. Yes, quit my presence, thou Who standest here so haughty in thy virtue; Thou darest not e'en now sustain my looks. Ne. How dar'st thou thus? Respect thy emperor's wife; And tremble ... Pop. Heed her not. She chuses well In me her judge: what judge can she e'er find More merciful? What other punishment To her who has betray'd my Nero's love, What other punishment can I inflict Than that of losing him eternally? What punishment to thee can be more light? That vulgar love, which thou in vain concealest, Thou hast obtain'd my free consent to publish. Yes, worthy mistress of Eucerus, I Would worthily to him affiance thee. Oct. Alas! Eucerus only is a veil To guilt compared with which e'en he is noble. But I with thee contend not: to that honour I was not born; I am not so audacious ... Ne. To whom art thou now equal? Thy base flame Makes thee more vile than e'en the vilest handmaid: Yes, from thy rank, and from thy noble birth, Thou art entirely fallen. Oct. Less wouldst thou hate me, If I had fallen thus to the lowest pitch; Or if thou couldst believe it. But I yield, If thus thou willest, every thing to thee Except my innocence. Oh, cruel Nero, Nor can I cease, whate'er thou be'st, to love thee, Nor for that love to blush: immense disgrace, 'Tis true, I feel it to proclaim myself The rival of PoppÃ¦a: but I am not; Never did she love thee: thy rank, thy throne, And all the splendour that encircles thee, These, and not Nero, have secured her heart. Ne. Perfidious woman, now, e'en now ... Oct. And thou, When I began to love thee, such thou wert not: Perhaps thou wert born for virtue: never, never Didst thou discover in thy early years Such dire propensities. Who has thus changed Thy nature, changed thy heart? she that bewitch'd Thy faculties; she first instructed thee To thirst for blood; she is the curse of Rome. My own wrongs I suppress, which are the least; But by thy means the very Tyber runs Distain'd with blood; brother, and mother ... Ne. Cease, Be silent, leave me, or I ... Pop. Does she merit The indignation of my lord? Abuse Is the accustomed idle subterfuge Of the convicted. If she could offend me, Or thou couldst yield belief to what she says, One of her words alone had wounded me. What said she? that I love thee not? thou knowest . . Oct. Better than he thou know'st it; he would know it If he should lose the throne; then would he fully Behold thee as thou art. Ah why, oh throne, The only cause that Nero hates me thus, Wert thou my cradle? Ah! why sprung I not From obscure blood? to thee had I then been Less hateful, less suspected, less displeasing. Ne. To me less hateful? Thou wert always so, And now thou art much more so: but that hate Will now be transient. Pop. And if I boast not Imperial ancestors, dost thou infer My blood is thence obscure? Yet if it were, 'Twere a sufficient solace not to be Daughter of Messalina. Oct. My forefathers Sat on the throne; from thence to all the world Their failings are divulged; but who e'er heard Of thy obscure and unknown ancestors? Yet if betwixt us any one should dare To make comparisons, could he allege Against Octavia an exchange of husbands? Am I perchance the refuse of a Rufus, Or of an Otho? Ne. For a little while, Of death art thou the refuse. Now, the mode Of thy destruction is alone uncertain; Thou canst but change it for the worse.âDepart; Meanwhile keep thou to thy apartments; go; And let me no more hear thee. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Nero, PoppÃ¦a. Ne. Learn, PoppÃ¦a, To know thyself, to know thy Nero, better. Should I abandon Rome to fire and sword, And should I bury with myself my throne, I swear to thee, this outrage is the last That thou shalt bear from her; nor from my hands Shall she be ever rescued.âCalm thyself; Resume thy confidence; confide in me ... Pop. I have no fear except to die not thine ... Ne. Ah! cease. The tumult rapidly has risen, And quickly will subside: I also now Prepare myself for action. Be secure; Of all the indignities that thou hast suffer'd, Me wilt thou speedily behold th'avenger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. PoppÃ¦a, Seneca. Pop. Of me what wouldst thou? Sen. Pardon me, I come Inopportunely; but, perchance, I come For thy advantage. Pop. Wherefore, now, in thee Springs such solicitude for my advantage? Say, wert thou ever, art thou now, my friend? What other reason than to injure me? ... Sen. I never would, assuredly, assist thee, Did not the means of least risk to Octavia, With means of thy advantage, coalesce. Pity for th'innocent, illustrious lady, A love of justice, and long weariness Of my disgraceful and unfruitful life, Lead me to speak; and from no other source Except thy interest, claim I, or expect, From thee a patient hearing. Pop. Let us hear: What canst thou say to me? Sen. That thou wilt soon Become displeasing to the heart of Nero, If he perceive the multitude persist Tenaciously in hating thee. In this I speak to thee the truth: I know PoppÃ¦a, Nero, the times, and Rome. Pop. Thou knowest all Except thyself. Sen. Men at my death will see Whether I know myself. Hear me meanwhile; Hear me, I pray thee. To thy own destruction, With too much wishing to destroy Octavia, Thou hastenest now. Rome taxes thee alone Both with her exile and divorce: to thee 'Twill always be ascribed, if infamy, Or greater punishment await her. Hence The aversion 'gainst thyself, intense already, The rancorous whisperings, a thousand-fold Will be increased. The people, mutinous, Are not dispersed; yet, grant that it were so, Does not the day return in which 'twill be Still more tremendous? Tremble for thyself, PoppÃ¦a; for thy Nero has a heart, If self-defence required the sacrifice, To immolate the whole to save himself. Perhaps a light obstacle allures to love; But quickly one that's insurmountable Destroys it in a bosom not sublime. Then flatter not thyself: for Nero holds (And for a long time has he held) the throne, Far, far more precious than thy love, or thee. And woe on thee, if he is forced by Rome, To chuse betwixt you both. Pop. And I hold Nero Far, far more precious than the throne. If I Fear'd, on my own account, to risk his safety ... But, what dost thou suggest? Is Nero not The absolute lord of Rome? and shall he heed A vile and apprehensive multitude, Which silently, implicitly, obeyed Tiberius and Caligula? Sen. Thou shouldst heed it, If thou wilt not that Nero for himself Should tremble at it; yes, defy all fear, Remove the last remaining check from Nero; And thou of this wilt be the first to feel The sad effects. Useless is all the blood Which solemnized thy fatal nuptial rites, If ye dare add to-day Octavia's blood. Reflect on Agrippina: her fierce son She loved, but well she knew him; she would never, From the apprehension of his rival brother, Never exempt him. His ferocious cunning At last prevail'd; and the unhappy youth Imbibed the guilty poison in his breast. Vain were the mother's arts, and soon for them She paid herself the penalty. From thence More resolute in crime, Nero we saw Day after day more deeply plunge in blood. Octavia now remains to such a monster The only check; Octavia, Nero's terror, Idol of Rome. Octavia take away; Let him possess thee in tranquillity; Soon wilt thou see him cloy'd. He loves thee now, Because he has purchased thee with so much blood; But if a danger, though a feeble one, Thou cost him, love is gone. Ah then expect That meed of which Nero was never sparing; To those who love him most, the death most cruel. Pop. He comes; proceed. Sen. 'Tis what I most desire. SCENE THE SECOND. Nero, PoppÃ¦a, Seneca. Ne. Obey'st thou thus my prohibition, rebel? ... Pop. Ah come! ah come! and thou shalt hear ... Ne. Hear what? Ere long and he shall also hear from me The self-same arguments which I prepare For all the people. But, oh rage! E'en yet That execrable tumult ceases not: Fruitless are prayers: ere long the sword shall come, And it shall clear away an ample passage. PoppÃ¦a, calm thy spirits: thou shalt see Thy images to-morrow rise again To heaven: and in the same filth, but bedaubed With noisome, sable gore, thou shalt behold Thy rivals dragged. Pop. Whate'er from this ensues, Let Rome from thee now know that I have not From thee exacted blood to expiate This offered outrage; though it cost me much To bear it. Yet the guilty people dares Allege against me cruel views; and he, This thy preceptor, dares to second them, Though he believe them not. Thee I attest, Thee, my first deity, of this: thou knowest If I from thee have ever asked for aught Except Octavia's exile. Evermore To see her near me, who, without desert, My Nero first possest, afflicted me: But, with her exile satisfied, I deem'd That she, for her so many crimes, received, In losing thee, an ample punishment; A punishment which I ... Ne. Let Seneca, And, with him, let the vulgar prate at will. Soon by convincing proofs I'll shew to Rome What this her idol is. Sen. Nero, take heed; It is more easy for thee to alarm, Than to cheat Rome: the one thou oft hast done; The other never. Ne. But of thee, thou knowest, I often have avail'd myself to cheat her; And thou in this wert tractable ... Sen. I too Was often culpable; but I abode In Nero's court. Ne. Vile slave! . . Sen. I was, so long As I was silent; but now the day arises When I unloose, to words ne'er heard before, My tongue, no longer parasitical. 'Tis true, that words will be a poor atonement For my delinquency; but perhaps my fame May be recovered by a lofty death. Ne. I will give thee the fame thou meritest. Sen. While still I hear the murmurs of the people, Which by the salutary check of fear Soften thy fury, thou'rt constrain'd to bear me. Meanwhile my heart exults to irritate Thy haughty passions; and to make thee hear, So make thee hear, the truth; that when again Thy courage thou resumest, I shall fall Its victim first; and if on me the blow Of thy revenge first fall not, on Octavia, I swear to thee, it never shall descend. The already mutinous people I can raise, And to more fury I can raise than ever; I can and will fully reveal to them Our infamous contrivances; and thus, More than thou thinkest, to the extremest edge Of fathomless perdition hurry thee.â I was the counsellor of Nero once; And mail'd my heart for him in borrow'd steel; I, grovellingly, believed to flatter him, Or rather feign'd belief, (alas too much!) That circumventive arts for the lost throne Rightfully cost Britannicus his life; That Agrippina, since she gave to thee The throne, was guilty; Plautius, and Silius, Guilty in being reputed worthy of it; And lastly feign'd that Burrhus too was guilty From having many times preserved it for thee. But guilty more than all the rest I deem'd, And still I deem myself: and will proclaim it, In life and death proclaim it openly, To every creature that my voice can reach. Satiate thy rage on me; thou mayest securely; But tremble, Nero, if thou slay'st Octavia: To thee I do announce it, all her blood Will turn, with large addition, to o'erwhelm thee.â I've spoken; it behoved me once to speak.â Thou wilt hereafter in reply bestow On meâand at thy greatest leisureâdeath. SCENE THE THIRD. Nero, PoppÃ¦a. Pop. Emperor, appease thy rage ... Ne. For words like these I'll make thee pay ere long.âOh insolence! . . Then am I here of all men least, the slave Of every braggard, till my army come? Of contradictory and diverse schemes On every side I have a stress: and those, Whom by a sudden blow I would o'erwhelm, By long elaborate contrivances, And one by one, I'm forced to immolate. Pop. Oh what compunction in my heart I feel! What conflict in myself! Of all thy cares I am the guilty reason, I alone. Ne. The more thou costest me, the more I love thee. Pop. 'Tis time at length, oh Nero, it is time, That, by myself, a lofty remedy Should be applied, since I alone possess it. Ne'er hope the audacious people will be tranquil While I am with thee. Ah, Rome now disdains That generous progeny of the mighty CÃ¦sars Which I shall give her soon. 'Twere better far That on the miscreated lineage Of an Egyptian slave the imperial sway Hereafter should devolve. A powerful mind, Such as perchance I have not, could alone Tear up this evil by the roots. Although A pretext I afford, and nothing else, To popular commotions which arise Elsewhere, yet have I in my heart decreed ... Ah, yes, but too irrevocably fixed! ... I ought to do it, and I will ... Ne. Ah! cease.â It was my business to gain time with time, And somewhat of it I have gain'd already. What fear'st thou now? Depend upon it, we Shall be triumphant ... Pop. Ah permit that I, If at thy feet I do not now expire, Give thee my last farewel ... Ne. What sayest thou? Arise! Shall I leave thee? Pop. What profits it To feign with me? Do not I plainly see, Emperor, that thou, alone to calm my spirits, Forcest thyself to hide from me thy fears? Do not I read thy heart's most secret movements In thy beloved face? A lady's eye, Sharpen'd by love, sees all things at a glance.â At the audacious popular commotion Octavia's coming caused, thou wert at first Astonish'd; now thou hear'st the hardihood Increasing, which affrighted ... Ne. I affrighted? Pop. I know thy firm heart still persists in vengeance; But doubtful are the means: meanwhile dost thou Remain obnoxious to repeated insults. Thou wert constrain'd e'en now to hear with patience The irreverent babblings of a Seneca: Thou seest clearly ... Ne. I affrighted? Pop. Yes; For me thou art so:âof another fear Thou'rt not susceptible: thou feel'st alarm'd, Lest on my head the popular storm should fall.â Couldst thou now love, and not be apprehensive? For me, 'tis easy from my own distress, To infer thy state. Distracted by thy danger, Full of thy image, mindless of myself, The transient flash of a precarious peace Suffices not to calm me. To our fears I wish to put an end, and extricate Thee from all risk, by my own sacrifice.â For ever I will lose thee, to preserve Entire for thee the affections of thy people. Ne. But what? dost think me ... Pop. Nero, say no more: I will, in spite of thee, promote thy good: I am resolved to abdicate thy throne; To chuse a voluntary banishment From Rome; and, if need be, from the vast empire. Her, whom the multitude would now enthrone, Let her be empress, since the multitude Is made the arbiter of thy affections: Yes, let her have the throne, (this is the least) But she will have my Nero's bed and love ... ... Unhappy that I am! ... Thus wilt thou have Security and peace.â'Twill be to me A solace, if a solace I deserve, And if I cannot, while I live, possess thee, 'Twill be to me an ample solace, thus, By quitting, to have snatch'd thee from all danger ... Ne. Yield, lady, to the entreaties of thy consort; Or the injunctions of thy lord respect. From me thou canst not, no, not e'en thyself Can, take thyself away; except my life, And my vast empire should be first snatch'd from me, No human force can do it. To my vengeance, Which ought to be so memorably fierce, And to th'ungovernable rage that boils Within my breast, (e'en I am forced to own it) Compared with their intensity, the means By which they operate are slow; and perhaps They seem more tardy than they really are: But is a vengeance resolute like mine, Because suspended, dead? Pop. To save thyself, Or to acquire more time, believe me, Nero, My banishment is indispensable.â Wouldst thou that I should by constraint depart, While now I can with a good grace? The people Dare menace even this; and this will be The mildest of its threatenings. It pretends To chuse another husband for Octavia, And that he reign with her. Thus, thou dost see, Sovereign arbitrement in her is centred. Shall I permit thee for PoppÃ¦a's sake T'exchange the throne? Ah! Nero, take at once My last farewell ... Ne. Cease, cease: this is too much. Pop. And even should the day arrive, when thou Shalt, o'er Octavia, and the people, gain Sovereign ascendency, thou wilt incur Thence, in no small degree, eternal hate. And then, who knows? thou mightest blame for this Wretched PoppÃ¦a. That which now thou feel'st, Genuine regard for me, who knows, if thou Repentant, wilt not then, for hate, exchange it? Oh heaven! At such a thought my blood runs cold. Ah! let me sooner die afar from thee ... But thus, at least, I carry to the tomb Thy love, with me, entire ... Ne. Let this suffice; My rage already is too much inflamed ... Dismiss all projects of abandoning me. Rome, and the world, and heaven, permit it not, Mine shalt thou always be: this Nero swears. SCENE THE FOURTH. Tigellinus, Nero, PoppÅa. Ti. Long live the emperor. Ne. Hast thou slain, dispersed them? Am I the lord of Rome?âBut what? thou comest With an unbloody sword? Ti. The time for blood Is not yet come; but it approaches swiftly. But yet the greatest art is necessary; Various reports I spread among the people: Now, that thou perhaps didst meditate once more To reinstate Octavia; if she could From some aspersions of malignant tongues Exonerate her fame: now, that the wild, And frantic insults to PoppÅa shewn, Had, even in Octavia's bosom, roused A noble indignation; and that she Returns to Rome the harbinger of peace, Not of disturbance ... Pop. Thinks the foolish people That I, for her, feel pity? ... Ne. Always art, Always? Never the sword? Ti. The circumstance The most improbable, sometimes appears True to the people. At these various tales, Whether convinced, or wearied, it repress'd, In a great measure, the extravagance Of its rebellious joy. Meanwhile the day Declines; and night's lugubrious shade will be A signal to far other arguments. Already the pretorians noiselessly Have mustered; many are proscribed already. The sun to-morrow will arise in blood; And thence in silence. Yet if thou dost wish Complete extinctions ere to-morrow's close Of all refractory broils; if thou dost wish A desolation long and terrible, Should, to a false and transient joy, succeed; Thou art constrain'd now to full light to bring The heavy accusations urged already Against Octavia: by another method Thou ne'er wilt fully consummate thy purpose. Thou canst not slay at will ... Ne. So much the worse. Ti. But thou mayst all convince. This, I assure thee, Is the last massacre where art is needful. Ne. Go, Tigellinus, since we are constrain'd to't, And the projected accusation urge With cautious vehemence. PoppÅa, now, Let us depart; soon shall we both obtain A complete triumph o'er this impious woman. Meanwhile the day will come, when my revenge Shall be secured without the aid of others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Octavia. Oct. Behold, already is the people hush'd: All tumult ceases; and a silence reigns, As fall the shades of night, like that of death. Here I'm commanded to expect my fate: So Nero will'd.âWhile I thus weep alone, What is he doing? In disgraceful revels Is he already ushering in the night? Feels he in safety then? So quickly? Fully? ... And lives he in security! But, prompt To fear, and prompt to banish fear, he yields No credit to a distant danger: Ah! May such an error not to him prove fatal!â Now midst the obscene, and inebriate revels Of an intemperate table, he prepares, There is no doubt, an agonizing death For me. Thus did I see my brother slain Amid nocturnal orgies; character'd, In bloody symbols, at the nightly banquet, Was Agrippina's fate: the trembling limbs Of all his family, are now become The holocaust most savoury to his sense; The sacrificial requisite to illustrate, And give a poignance to his festal triumphs. But the time passes; and no one approaches ... And I know nothing ... can e'en Seneca With all the rest abandon me? Perchance He breathes no more ... Oh heaven! ... and he alone Pitied my sufferings ... Nero perhaps on him Has wreak'd his fury ... But, oh joy! He comes. SCENE THE SECOND. Octavia, Seneca. Oct. Oh joy! art thou then living, Seneca? Oh come, my more than father ... What is this? Thou wear'st a less dejected countenance: What tidings dost thou bring me? Sen. Unaspersed, Enjoy eternally thy innocence. Thy unexampled goodness with its warmth Has touch'd the obduracy of servile hearts, Inflaming them to virtue. 'Mid the pangs Of the most cruel martyrdom, thy maidens, All, with one voice, the invented crime denied. Distinguish'd by her firmness from the rest, Marcia, with masculine and free-born aspect, (Enough to make us trembling slaves ashamed) Fixing on Nero her undaunted looks, Now Tigellinus, and now Nero, she, With a loud voice, alternately proclaim'd Impious impostors: rapt with generous rage Triumphantly she chaunted solemn hymns, Commemorative of Octavia's virtue, 'Mid torments seemed incapable of pain, And thus heroically breathed her last. Oct. Ah victim, worthy of a better fate! ... But what boots this? To redeem mine, what blood Can now suffice? Sen. More difficult than ever Will Nero find it now to spill that blood. Thou hast gain'd fame and honour, where the tyrant Hoped to draw on thee infamy and death. Even Eucerus his approaching fate With benedictions hail'd. Now horrid oaths, By which his spirit to the infernal gods He consecrates; now free ferocious words, He utters, which attest thy innocence; And now he swears that ropes, and swords, and axes, To him are far more welcome, than the gold Which, as the price of calumny, was proffer'd. To every man around him he revealed The ineffectual bribes of Tigellinus: The very executioners themselves, Smitten with unaccustomed horror, listened, And e'en in spite of their ferocious office Kept him at bay, and dallied with his death. These grateful tidings to impart to thee Swiftly I came. Oct. See, who approaches now: See him, and hope. Sen. Oh heaven! SCENE THE THIRD. Tigellinus, Octavia, Seneca. Ti. The emperor Sends me to thee. Oct. Ah! bringest thou my death? Now that my innocence is proved, 'twill be To me acceptable. Ti. Thy emperor yet Holds thee not guiltless; and to make thee so, 'Twas not enough to fortify with poison, Eucerus, and thy accessory handmaids, And baffle thus the instruments of torture. Thou hast exempted them from pangs, 'tis true, But thou hast taken from thyself the means Of exculpation. Oct. What new subterfuge? ... Ti. Nero now interdicts, that trespasses Not clearly proved should be alleged against thee. Another now, another accusation, Far different to the former one, awaits thee; And this delinquent, not constrain'd by torture, But free, unquestion'd, comes to ask for mercy. Oct. And what delinquent? Tell me. Ti. Anicetus. Sen. The executioner of Agrippina! Oct. What do I hear? Ti. The same that Nero saved From imminent danger: to his emperor then Faithful he stood; thou, lady, afterwards Mad'st him a traitor. He, repentant, now, Flies on thy steps; first he himself accuses, And all discovers: but not less for this His punishment awaits him. Oct. What imposture! ... Ti. Perhaps, then, he did not promise that the troops, Of which he is the leader in Misenus, Should, at thy wish, rebel?âAnd, on what terms, Ought I to tell thee? Oct. Oh, forlorn of hope! What do I hear? Oh execrable race! Oh times! ... Ti. On thee does Nero now impose, To clear thyself at once of shameful intrigues, Of instigating leaders to rebel, Of disaffected words, of stratagems So often, yet so fruitlessly, contrived Against PoppÅa; and of popular tumults; Or he insists that thou confess thy guilt: And for this purpose he allows to thee This coming day. Oct. ... Too much he gives to me.â Go thou, return to him: beg him that he Here with PoppÅa come. I would alone To them disburthen my so many crimes: I ask no more: So much obtain for me; Go. Let PoppÅa come exultingly In my disgrace to triumph; I expect her. SCENE THE FOURTH. Octavia, Seneca. Sen. What wouldst thou do? Oct. Expire before their eyes. Sen. What dost thou say? ... Alas if thou dost wish it, He will forbid thy death. Oct. And would I ask Such an inestimable gift from Nero?â From others I demand it; and I hope ... Sen. Nero was once well known to me; but yet, I must confess, that now I am o'erwhelm'd With blank astonishment. Each moment he, Passing all thought of other men, becomes More terrible. Oct. For a most lofty purpose, I in my secret thought have chosen thee, Oh Seneca. Thou mayest prove to me, If love, esteem, or pity in thy breast Thou bear'st for me, to-day. To me wert thou Of incorruptible and spotless virtue The inculcator; thou art call'd upon To be to me this day the minister Of necessary death. Sen. What do I hear? ... Oh heaven! ... A voluntary death should be The offspring of involuntary impulse. Oct. Am I so sunken then in thy esteem, That thou accountest me incapable Of an immutable arbitrement? Now, is not death of all the menaced evils, Perhaps the least? What else remains for me? Speak.âThou art silent? Sen. Oh disastrous day! Oct. Speak; speakâWhat else remains for me to do? Sen. My heart thou rendest ... But can I e'er be Cruel to such a pitch? Oct. Shall wisdom now In thee be so fallacious? Canst thou be So cruel as to see me dragged the victim Of my ferocious rival, who esteems My death an insufficient sacrifice Not join'd with infamy? Hast thou the heart To see Octavia again exposed To the indecent and extorted charges Of every ribald sycophant? To see her Deliver'd over to the insatiable, And frantic rage of Nero? Sen. Why have I Lived to see this? ... Oh inauspicious day! Oct. But what now stops thee? ... And what fearest thou? Perhaps thou hast yet a hope? Sen. Who knows? Oct. Thou, less Than any other, hopest: thou dost know Nero too well: thou for thyself hast fix'd (And certainly wouldst not to me deny it) To escape from him by voluntary death. Thou firm in this, herein dost thou deem me Inferior to thyself; and lovest me? Nero is dreadful to me while I see This wretched and tormented frame of mine, The dwelling of my soul. He may subject it To all that's exquisite in pain and sorrow. And should I yield to menaces and torments? And if from fear there should escape my lips Of not committed, nor imagined faults, A forced confession? ... For a length of time Accustomed to behold death near at hand, Thou art secure: not thus am I; in age Yet immature, and in my heart unbraced; Nursed in the lap of delicate indulgence; Ne'er school'd by nature to the natural virtues; And 'gainst a premature, and cruel death Armed feebly, and imperfectly: by thee, If so thou wilt, I may escape from life; But have not constancy to wait for death. Sen. Oh wretched me! with my declining years I hoped to rescue thine. 'Twas my design That from my lips the people should have heard The hidden, wicked, horrid arts of Nero; ... But I have lived in vain: all Rome is hushed; And only listens to its wretched fears. To me the egress from this fatal place Is now forbidden ... Oh heaven! who can prevail, Himself not impious, 'gainst an impious master! Oct. Thou weepest? ... Me from infamy and pangs Ah save! ... From death, thou seest 'tis in vain To expect it. Save me, pity bids thee ... Sen. Though I e'en were willing ... Now ... in such short space? ... I have no sword with me; and instantly Comes Nero ... Oct. Poison thou hast always with thee: In these opprobrious thresholds, of the just The sole resource. Sen. I, ... with me? ... Oct. Yes; thyself Toldest me this in former times: ah then Like a fond father to a daughter, thou To me revealed'st the most secret thoughts Of thy afflicted soul. Remember, ah! I also wept with thee at thy recital.â But, wouldest thou deny it? I already Am risen above myself. Necessity Makes e'en the weakest valiant. Instantly Comes Nero; at his side he always wears A dagger: I will spring towards it, and grasp it, And with it pierce myself ... My hand perchance May lack address; yet I will make the attempt. Of having sought to murder him, at once I shall be charged by Nero: and thou wilt see me Doom'd to a death of unexampled suffering. Sen. Ah, spare me, lady: this is worse than death! ... Thou would'st by me obtain it ... thou'rt mistaken ... I have no poison with me ... Oct. Dost not thou Wear on thy finger still a faithful ring? Behold it; I will have it ... Sen. Ah! desist ... Oct. In vain ... I grasp it. And I know its use: Its contents yield a swift and painless death. Sen. I call the heavens to witness ... I conjure thee, ... Restore it to me ... If another way ... Oct. No other way remains. Behold it opened ... I have already with my breath absorbed The dust mortiferous ... Sen. Woe, woe is me! Oct. May heaven reward thee for the precious gift, To me so opportune ... See, Nero comes ... Ah hasten ... death ... to set my spirit ... free. SCENE THE FIFTH. Nero, PoppÃ¦a, Tigellinus, Octavia, Seneca. Ne. Thou fatal cause of all that I endure! Who from my hands can rescue thee at last? Who now shouts for thee? Where is all the people?â Thou hast well chosen: 'tis thy last resource To manifest thyself, and so to publish To Rome and all the world thy countless crimes; To clear me to my people, and receive What thou deservest, death with infamy. Sen. The moment was well chosen; I repent No more. Oct. Already art thou fully cleared, Oh Nero; triumph.âThat I e'er was thine, And that I ever loved thee, I have given Myself already the due punishment. Ne. The punishment? What hast thou done? Oct. My veins Already have imbibed a mortal poison. Ne. And whence? ... Pop. Oh, Nero, now thou'rt mine indeed. Ne. The poison whence? ... 'Tis false. Ti. Thou oughtest not To trust her words; a vigilant guard ... Sen. A guard May be deluded; thus with thine it fared. The gods refuse not, to the just, deliverance. Oct. Poison will soon destroy me; thou wilt see it: Behold, who in compassion gave it to me; Rather, to say the truth, I snatch'd it from him. He will exult in it, if thou for this Should'st punish him; thence I conceal it not. See, my salvation in this jewel lay. Thou, on the day of our disastrous nuptials, Shouldest have given me a gem like this. Ne. I see it; yes, this is the last, this is The plot the most atrocious, to make me The abhorrence of all Rome. Ah miscreant, thou Contrivedst it, but soon ... Pop. Thou hast escaped, Octavia, from thy punishment; in vain Thou hopest to escape from infamy. Oct. Shall I reply to thee?âTo my last words Do thou, oh Nero, listen. I now touch, Believe me, on that awful crisis touch, When mortal fears and hopes alike subside, When simulation can no more avail, E'en had I ever practised it ... I die: And Seneca destroys me not: ... thou only, Thou slayest me, oh Nero: though not giv'n By thee, the poison whence I die is thine.â I charge thee not with this as with a crime. Sooner thou should'st have done this; from the moment In which I first became displeasing to thee, 'Twere far less cruel then in thee to slay me, Than to bestow thyself upon a lady, Who, willing it, ne'er could know how to love thee. But all I pardon thee; and pardon thou (My only crime) if I from thee have wrested, By hastening thus my death a few brief hours, The pleasure of unlimited revenge.â All, Nero, all I willingly had giv'n thee Except my honour; and for thee had suffered All mortal pangs save that of infamy ... I hope no injury will result to thee ... From ... my ... decease. The throne is thine; enjoy it: May peace be thine ... Round thy ensanguined bed ... I swear to thee ... to never ... never ... come ... A mournful spectre ... to disturb ... thy ... dreams ... Meanwhile one day thou wilt know her.â Ne. The more I know her, more I love her; and I swear Always to love her more. Sen. These words inflict The last shock on her heart: she dies ... Pop. Oh come, Let us now quit these horrible apartments. Ne. Yes, let us go: and let the camp and Rome Know that I slew her not: and also know The crime and punishment of Seneca. SCENE THE SIXTH. Seneca. Sen. I will forestall thee.âFuture times shall know, Exempt from fear and flattery, the truth.</field>
