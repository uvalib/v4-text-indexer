      <field name="fulltext">IVAN, A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Men. Ivan, the deposed Emperor of Russia. Count Naritzin, Governor of Schlusselburgh. Count Rimuni, Favourite of the Empress. Galinovitz, Sub-governor. Mirovitz, an Officer on guard in the Fort. Feodor, his Brother, ditto. Galvez, Servant of Naritzin. Altorf, Servant of Rimuni. Narshkoff and two sons, Fishermen. Ortosk, Sentinel. Senators, Conspirators, Soldiers. Women. Elizabeth, Empress of Russia. Petrowna, Wife of Count Naritzin. Place, the Fort of Schlusselburgh, an isle in the Neva. Time, fourteen hours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The exterior of the Fort, on the margin of the Neva, Behind, the Castle and Towers of Schlusselburgh. Mirovitz enters. Miro. 'Tis now the morning-watchâfrom tow'r to tow'r Hark! round yon fort's wide circuit, loudly rings The voice of challeng'd sentinels. The time, Th'appointed hour is past. Methinks, I hear Advancing steps.â'Twas but the Neva's flood That round this isle, the abode of woe and horror, Whirls its swift eddies. Feodor enters. Feodorâmy brother. SpeakâFeodor? Feo. The same. Miro. Why this delay? Feo. 'Tis ever thusâthy fervent spirit outruns Th'appointed time. Miro. Speed! speed, ye hours of vengeance! Oh that night's thickest clouds were gather'd round me! Till then where hide my deep disgrace? Feo. Be patient. Miro. Say, was it slight th'offence, that here, so long, In these drear haunts, doom'd for my sire's misdeeds, I still have serv'd inglorious? wrong on wrongâ Insult on insult! nayâ'tis known to all, That when the ruthless minion, proud Rimuni, Had of his honour'd charge depriv'd Naritzin, On me by right and ordinance of service, Devolved the care of Ivan. Vain my claims. Galinovitz, it seems, has won their favour; A stripling, in his boy-hood, o'er my brow Rais'd as in mockery. Be swift vengeance mine! Deep, deadly as their outrage. Feo. Mirovitz, 'Tis in thy power. The guard who serve the night-watch, Now, at my word assembled, wait thy bidding, In secret, in the cavern, delv'd beneath The western bastion, whose huge bulk drives back The wint'ry floods. But not on them alone Our hope is fix'd: all whom this isle contains, At thy first summons will arise in arms To free Naritzin. Such his kindly rule, That when the herald's voice aloud proclaim'd That here the Empress and Rimuni meet This day to seal his doom, the cry of wrath, Of vengeance, and revolt, rang round the isle. Go forthâand head the tumult. Miro. Feodor, The rage and uproar of the populace Burst like the tide, whose refluent waves, ere long, Die off unheard: not such my course of vengeance. Its progress like the Neva's ceaseless stream, That gathering up its strength from thousand rills Sweeps onward, without ebb, and undermines The tower whose shadow slumbers on its bosom In proud security. My art shall gain To serve my deep revenge, all who this night Hold watch and ward o'er Ivan. Feo. Speed, and prosper. [Exeunt. Scene the Second. A Cavern outside the Ramparts. Conspirators. Con. He comes not. Hence. Con. Stay, comrades! wherefore dread In Mirovitz, delay? you, who so oft Witness'd his valour, first to mount the breach, Or singly scale the fortress? Con. Hark, some step Approaches. Comrades! on your guard: be watchful! Nearer it hastens: on your guard, I sayâ Now boldly challenge. [They draw their swords. Mirovitz and Feodor enter. Con. Friend or foe? advance not. Feo. 'Tis Mirovitz. Miro. Put up your swords, brave comrades! Say, are all present? Theodore, I see, Norkots, and Ostralof, and brave Nagotzin. I greet thee, bold Truwarotz, Sulskoi, too, And Voronetz, who never fled from man. Feo. Behold them, brave, determin'd; speak thy will. Miro. My will! not so: 'tis loyalty, 'tis honour Points out their path. Comrades, the prisoner, Ivan, Is Russia's rightful Emperor. 'Tis your king Claims vengeance. By his wrongs, his woes, I urge you: Recall to mind, the day which hail'd him monarch, Saw him a helpless prisoner; call to mind, How, on from fort to fort, they dragg'd their victim, Ere to this spot accurst, this last abode Of horror and despair, Rimuni doom'd him As one entomb'd alive, in yon drear cell To moulder limb by limb. No beam of day Ere glimmers on the cell that hears his groan: And, till renown'd Naritzin here held charge, 'Tis known to allâthe fierce barbarians tortur'd His tender limbs. The sentinels on watch, Tho' us'd to blood and groans of horrid death, Have quak'd to hear his night-shriek. Con. We will free him. Fix thou the hour. Miro. First, yield me patient hearing. You all revere Naritzin. Con. Yesâas children Honour a father. Miro. You would shed your blood To rescue him from wrong. Con. Most willingly. Miro. Naritzin cannot brook such deep disgrace. Thus wrong'd by her. Herâon whose brow his hand Once fix'd the crown! if fam'd Naritzin join us, The realm would rise in arms. Con. Lead to Naritzinâ Miro. [stopping him.] Yet stay. Say, brave associates, if the lord Naritzin Decline our proffer'd aid, are all resolv'd To free their sov'reign? Con. We will rescue Ivan, Or bravely perish. Onâ Miro. Yetâere we speed, Pledge we a soldier's faith, a soldier's honour, That in this cave, ere night-fall, once again We meet, to fix the hour, and give to each Fit charge and separate station. Cons. Yesâere night-fall, Here we will meet. To thee we freely pledge A soldier's honour. Lead us forth. Miro. Brave comrades, I lead where glory summons: fearless follow. [Exeunt. Scene the Third. A rocky shore on the margin of the Lake, overlooked by a Bastion of the Fort. Narshkoff and his two Sons enter, and spread a Net on the Rocks. Son. [to his brother.] Cheer you, my brother: here awhile take rest: You are o'er-tir'd: here in the sun repose. Narsh. Give me the net, and I will spread it out, And on the smooth rock dry its dripping meshes: So, if perchance some soldier cross our way, We shall not breed suspicion, but may seem Intent on our day labour. [He looks round earnestly. Son. Tell me, father, Why do you seem disturb'd? what care comes o'er you? Why point to yon dark nook? Narsh. We have o'er-shot it. Look, my brave boys, our tough oars have o'er-shot The little creekâ'Tis there, beneath that rock, Where yon huge birch bow'd down by weight of years Hangs o'er the Neva. Son. 'Tis a cheerless spot, Gloomy as nightâ Narsh. That was th'appointed place; There we must anchor our light skiff, and wait The signalâWhen, at night, the torch thrice waves On yon tall eastern turretâlookâ Son. I note itâ Narsh. At the third signal, at a moment's warning All must be ready: we must hoist the sail If fair the breeze: if foul, brave boys, your sinews Must not refuse to labour at the oar, Till our good vessel o'er Ladoga's lake Has safely wafted the entrusted chargeâ It was no trifling bribeâ Son. Our life's at hazardâ Narsh. So is it, every day, when we do tempt The wave, and cast our meshes in the flood. Look you, so we but reach yon shore in safety The rest of life we may carouse at will. Take up the netâpush off the boatâawayâ Son. My brother is o'er-tir'd; a little moment, A moment rest. And, tell us, I entreat you, Whom we must land in safety on yon shore? Narsh. I know not: but, no doubt, some high-born prisoner Who has escap'd from chains. Son. Oh! were it Ivan, This hand should from my arm first drop in the wave Ere it let loose the oar. That hapless youth! I know not why it is, whene'er I hear His story, tho' it sorely grieve my heart, Yet doth it chain mine ear. Narsh. 'Tis ever so When miseries unprovok'd command our pity. In sooth his woe would melt a heart of stone. Ivan is rightful emperor: he was crown'd King in his cradleâ Son. Outâalas the day! It had been better, father, had poor Ivan Our brother been, and born like us to labour. Thenâhe had scap'd those torturers. Narsh. Would that Ivan Had perish'd with the monk who lur'd him forth, Ere to yon hideous cave the ruffians dragg'd him! 'Tis now, eight years gone by, and Ivan then Scarce ten years oldâ'Twas a bleak eve, and loudly The Neva roar'd: I never shall forget it. Just as I moor'd my boat yon side the flood, A band of soldiers hail'd me: loud their voice, And fiercely, as in wrath, their swords unsheath'd Wav'd o'er their prisoners. 'Twas a piteous sight, And all was strife and tumult. I full fain Had fled the spot, when one, with whose stern voice I dar'd not parley, bad me to this isle Ferry the prisoners, Ivan, and the monk, Each bound in chainsâ Son. The boy, their king, in chains! Narsh. Sore manacled. The child sunk down oe'rpower'd, Mute, motionless, save ever and anon A big tear trickled, and a deep sigh burst As it would break his heart. Not so the monk: I heard his thrilling outcry, as he writh'd And struggled with his chains, and with clench'd fist In frantic rage oft struck his hoary temples. And as I reach'd the fort, just as my oar Spent its last stroke, the monk, uprising, dash'd From either side the guard that closely grasp'd him, Then plung'd into the flood with all his weight Of fetters.âNever man beheld him more: Save, yearly, on that day, that very hour He perish'd, some have seenâ Son. Seen what? Say, fatherâ Narsh. His very self, that monk, so manacled, Rise from the flood, and point with threat'ning hand To Ivan's tow'r. But, hush! the air has ears, And the whole isle is vex'd with vigilant spies. [Ortosk, a Sentinel, appears on the bastion. Come, let us henceâ Ort. Speakâ Son. 'Tis the sentinel! Ort. I charge you, on your lives, say, wherefore here? Why, on this spot? Narsh. We are poor fishermen Who in these waters seek by daily labour Our hard-earn'd food. We were o'er-tir'd, good soldier, And came to dry our nets, and rest awhile On this smooth beach. Ort. Away, nor loiter here. If, when I challenge next, you here are found, You are for life imprison'd. [Sentinel goes. Narsh. Come, my boys! 'Tis dangerous tarrying here. Son. Oh grant, kind heav'n, That this stout oar may bear poor Ivan hence, And I will prize it as a monarch's sceptre. [Exeunt. Scene the Fourth. Naritzin's Castle. Naritzin. Narit. Wrong'd by Elizabeth! thy offspring! thine, Thou father of thy country! Her, on whose brow this hand the diadem fix'd Reft from the hapless Ivan! Judge of earth! And must Naritzin's conscious lip confess 'Tis righteous retribution? Must I own In bitterness of self-accusing misery Th'eternal truth, âOne deed unhallow'd teems With woe engend'ring woe?â What now awaits me? Death, or drear exile, where Siberia's snows Shall sepulchre my bones. Oh! were it mine Alone to suffer! But, thou ill-starr'd Ivan! To leave thee thus expos'd! And thou, most lov'd Petrowna, whose pure spirit did prefer To pomp and courts, this residence of horror, To share my doom; ah! 'tis thy secret grief That festers in this bosom. Righteous heav'n Heap on this head thy fury! Spare Petrowna! Oh shield the innnocent Ivan! Galvez enters. Galvez here! Why thus uncall'd? [A shout heard. Gal. My lord, and honour'd master, Hark to the voice that loudly calls on you, None, none shall injure you. Voices without. No pow'r on earth Shall wrong the good Naritzin. Petrowna enters. Narit. Ha! Petrowna! I pray thee, love, retire. [to Galvez.] Say, whence this tumult? Gal. All whom this isle contains, th'indignant soldiers Are risen to rescue you. Pet. 'Tis known to all, That here, the woman thy pow'r exalted, She who has basely wrong'd thee, and her minion, The insolent Rimuni, meet this day To seal thy condemnation. [Voices without.] Comrades! onâ Our swords shall guard Naritzin. Narit. [to Galvez.] Go, control Their fury. Gal. 'Tis in vain. Their rage enflam'd, If you deny them audience, will burst forth In maddening insurrection. Pet. Good, my lord, Admit them to thy presence. Thou hast ever Heard, and redrest their grievance. I beseech thee, Vouchsafe them gracious hearing. Narit. [to Galvez.] Give them entrance. [Galvez goes. Yes, I will curb this tumult. Aid me, heav'n! Make firm my mind, that I may yet withstand This dread temptation! Mirovitz and Soldiers enter. Wherefore here? Why, soldiers, This tumult? Who has injur'd you? Miro. My lord, You they have injur'd, basely wrong'd you.âHear us: Your rule has ever been most merciful: Your kindness and humanity have sooth'd Th'abode of horror: and while yet our hands Hold strength to wield a soldier's weapon, none Shall force you from this isle. Narit. Say, what thy purpose? Miro. To rescue you from violence and wrong. Narit. Thou, rescue me! Whence thy authority? Miro. High heav'n, who wills not that the guiltless suffer: The soul's resistless impulse to abase Tyrannic pow'r. Narit. Proud words but ill conceal Disloyal deeds. Soldiers, obey: depart Ere death repress your daring. Henceâ Sol. Speak, Mirovitz: This is a righteous cause. Miro. You see these veterans, Men like myself, grey-headed, worn with service. You know their gallant deeds. Narit. Yes, oft have witness'd. There's not a breast of those who now surround me Undinted by brave wounds. Miro. Shall then the chief Who marshall'd us to conquest, fall a victim To base suspicion? No: their brave right hands Each on his sword, are pledg'd. Speak but the word, The cannon levell'd to announce the arrival Of those weak tyrants, 'neath Ladoga's water Shall plunge in all its bravery their galley Ere it insult the fort. Narit. I'll hear no more. I am unarm'd, or I had plung'd my sword, Bold rebel! in thy heart. Henceâ Pet. Thy disgrace, Thy wrongs inflame their souls. Miro. At will command us: Naritzin's word needs not a sovereign's sanction. Narit. If then Naritzin's word has pow'r, obey it. Soldiers, your zeal betrays you. What your purpose? To shield Naritzin from the iron grasp Of merciless oppression? How? By deeds Whose guilt and dire enormities outswell The vile traducer's malice: deeds that cast Round spotless loyalty the blood-stain'd garb Of treason and rebellion. Here, first plunge Your weapons, ere a mutinous arm be rais'd To strike th'anointed brow. Revere your sov'reign! Each to his home, in peace, and from Naritzin Learn to submit. [Soldiers depart. Miro. [in going.] My lord, in time of peril Here claim redress. [Laying his hand on his sword. [Exit. Pet. [advancing solemnly.] And did I rightly hear thee? Submit! And didst thou speak it? Thine, that word! Narit. None but myself shall vindicate my honour. Pet. What thy resolve? Narit. I will confront the accuser, And shame the slanderous tongue. Pet. Why rush on death? Hear me pour forth my inmost soul, and plead For one in hopeless anguish, one by all Abandon'd: one, on whom no sun by day, Nor moon nor star by night, has sent its beam: Who for the freshness of the vital air, Drinks foul contagion, and for human utterance, Hears but the echo rendering back his groan, Or pestential damps, that drop by drop Burst on his flinty bed. I plead for Ivan. Thou did'st permit it, in the cell unseen Of human eye, I still'd his frantic shriek, The while he knew not whose the voice that sooth'd him. I taught him to adore the awful pow'r Whose chastisement is love: and, year by year Matur'd his virtues, and beheld the flow'r That cruel hands once crush'd, expanding fair Beneath my tendance. Who shall tend him now? The ruthless torturers? Narit. You wound my soul. Pet. Is mine at peace? Oh grant my pray'r. Free Ivan: And fix himâfor thou can'stâthy word has pow'r, King on his father's throne. Narit. I crown'd Elizabeth, The offspring of my lord and much-lov'd master, The father of his country. I enthron'd her, Urge me no more. Pet. Be witness, earth and heav'n! Witness thyself! while on thy sacred word Her throne in proud security repos'd, Tho' my heart inly glow'd, my lip was silent. Forbearance now is base servility, Dishonouring our nature. Thou did'st crown her: What thy reward? Rimuni's word shall answer. Hear, and avenge! To thee, an injur'd nation Lifts up her voice: not this abode of horror That calls down light'ning from indignant heav'n, But, at thy word, a realm would rise in arms, And crush the usurper. Narit. Oh that heav'n's wing'd fires Had pierc'd my brow, or ere I had dethron'd The unoffending child! Pet. Restore him. Free From anguish and remorse thy troubled spirit. Narit. Henceâlest I do a deed whose mere suggestion Rives me with horror. [Cannon and shouts heard.] Heard you not that sound, Those shoutsâthat roar of cannon? 'Tisâ Pet. [interrupting him.] Th'usurper. Narit. [shouts and cannon repeated.] Againâ Pet. That sound announces her arrival This side the Neva. Narit. Now awhile, Petrowna, Farewell. I must prepare and arm my spirit, Pet. [interrupting him.] For insult, for oppression, for dire injuries That mock the utterance. Hear my farewell word: We may not meet again. Thou art the temple Where honour dwelt enshrin'd, and shall thy knee Bend at Rimuni's beck? and must Petrowna, (Spare, spare me that disgrace!) look tamely on And see her lord lift vainly up the hand That crown'd and uncrown'd kings, to that base minion A suppliant for pity? Narit. Neverânever. Bend to Rimuni? Lift to him this hand! Rather its strength shall o'er yon rampart wave War's crimson standard and array the realm In Ivan's cause. My pow'r shall yet prevail: Thro' me the voice of truth shall reach the throne, And silence the oppressor. I this day Will lighten Ivan's doom: yon sun, this day Shall see Naritzin or Rimuni perish. Awhile farewell. Pet. Whate'er thy doom, is mine: Bonds, exile, death. Go thou where honour calls: Th'oppressor shall not triumph. Ivan! reign! END OF ACT THE FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The outward Fort. Galinovitz, Mirovitz, Feodor, Soldiers under arms to receive the Empress. Galin. [to Mirovitz.] The herald is arrived. Here will the Empress A few fleet hours remain. Ere day-light dies All speed away, and in new pomps and pleasures Blot out the memory of these scenes of horror. Miro. [aside] Oh that the Neva in its roaring waters Would their proud bark ingulph! [Sound of trumpets. Galin. [looking out.] Behold, they comeâ Gay as in festal pomp. The sun-beams gild Their streamers, now bright-waving in the wind, Now, as the light breeze falls, kissing in sport The Neva's dimpled wave. Miro. [aside.] Insulting pomp! That flares portentous on these drear abodes, Like some strange meteor that with transient glare, Appalls mankind. [Flourish of trumpets.] Yon trumpets' ceaseless clamour Proclaims their entry. [Looking out.] Ha! Rimuni leads her: Look, how she leans on his proud arm, and smiles Delighted with his flattery. The Empress, Rimuni, Senators, Guards, Heralds, enter in state. Sold. [kneeling.] Hail! long live Elizabeth, our gracious sov'reign! Emp. Riseâ I thank your love, and will reward your zeal. Rim. [presenting Galinovitz.] Galinovitz, now warden of yon fortress, More faithful than Naritzin, kneels before you. Deign to vouchsafe him audience! Galin. [laying at her feet various keys.] Gracious Empress! These at your feet I lay. This guards the gate That bars the outward fortress: this secures All that the inward moat encircles: this The citadel: these close the prisoner's cells: This, from the eye of man and light of heav'n, Hides Ivan. Rim. Lives he yet? Galin. Yet Ivan breathes. Rim. [aside.] Would he were dead! Emp. [to Galinovitz.] Sir, till our further will Resume thy charge. Miro. [aside to Feodor.] We must avoid suspicion. With seeming reverence we will kneel before her. [They kneel to the Empress. Emp. Your suitâyour names. Rim. [advancing, interrupts them.] Ungrateful to your ear. This, Mirovitz, that, Feodor, his brother, Their ancestors of old were fam'd for pow'r And loyalty: but their rebellious father Serv'd with Mazeppa, when that faithless chief Leagu'd with our foes against your godlike sire. The weight of his rebellion crush'd himself And all his race. Miro. We long in arms have serv'd you, And shed our youthful blood in tented fields, Following your standard. Rim. Vaunt not thus your duty. Emp. Merit by loyal deeds our further favour. Miro. We are your slaves [Shouts heard at Naritzin's approach. Rim. [aside.] The proud Naritzin comes. Naritzin enters, followed by Petrowna closely veiled. Sold. [kneeling to the Empress.] Look down with eye of favour on Naritzin. Rim. Peace! nor insult the royal presence. Narit. [kneeling respectfully to the Empress.] Justice. Rim. It shall not be delay'd. Narit. My lord Rimuni, Not unto you, Naritzin deigns appeal. Justice, my gracious mistress! Emp. Sir, it grieves me To see thee thus, here in the face of day A man accus'd, before the public eye Disgrac'd. I leant on thee, my lord Naritzin, As on the prop and column of my empire. Narit. If ere my zeal; I may not add my actions, Your favour won, now in the public presence Declare my crime. Rim. Before the senate answer: There hear thy condemnation. Pet. [aside to Naritzin.] Condemnation! Be firmâfarewell. [Petrowna goes. Narit. Hear, Empress! on his death-bed Your sire, my much-lov'd master, charg'd Naritzin By many a wound, when, side by side, our swords Bore conquest on their edge, that long as life Yet linger'd in these veins, I should uphold The glory of his empire, nor desert His royal offspring. Have I disobey'd My sov'reign's charge? Let this distinguish'd proof, Your gift, make answer. [A diamond cross.] With this high reward, When on your brow I fix'd the diadem, You deign'd to honour me. Suspicion's breath Must not with venemous taint pollute the breast Grac'd by a monarch's favour. At your word This hand resign'd my sword: a monarch's present. Take back your gift, and grant Naritzin's pray'r, Vouchsafe me one request, the plain demand Of justice. Emp. Speak. Narit. That you, my gracious mistress, Would deign your presence when Naritzin pleads Before th'assembled senate. Rim. Proud Naritzin! Mine is the grateful task to free the sov'reign From toils and cares of state: and I am charg'd To search out your misdeeds. Narit. I shall divulge Truths bitter to thy soul, thou man of guilt. Emp. Proclaim themâfreely speak: thy sov'reign bids thee. Narit. The image of my lord, and gracious master, The father of his country, lives in you. I may not here proclaim them. In your presence, Before the senate, at their secret council, All shall be fully told. Emp. There, we will hear thee. On to the council. There, my lord Naritzin, If guiltless, at my throne, before my presence Stand unappall'd. Thy sov'reign is thy judge. [Exeunt omnes. Scene changes to Ivan's Prison, faintly illumed with one central lamp. Petrowna enters with a lamp, and basket of provisions. Ivan asleep. Pet. Forgive my long delay! Ivanâoh answer me. He hears me not, Or, at the breath, the whisper of my word, His voice had giv'n kind welcomeâ[looking on him.] Deep his slumber: Yet, at this hour, such sleep is no repose That gently recreates nature. Gracious heav'n! How will his misery end? will once again Thy beam, oh blessed sun, illume his brow? Will he, in kindly fellowship with man, Feel what the god of kindness has infus'd In human hearts, responsive to the voice Of sympathy: or must this cell for ever Close on his unavenged wrongs? Ivan. [asleep.] Petrowna! Delay not. Pet. I am with theeâat thy sideâ A deep and heavy slumber weighs him down. Hark! in a vision, in some troublous dream His voice did call on me. Again: 'tis hush'd In silence and forgetfulness of woe. Not so with me. Can voice of mortal utter What this day may bring forth? 'Tis horror, all, And dread suspense. Sleep on, and wake no more! Thou, whose harsh doom of unexampled woe, Whose very weakness and infirmity Have link'd thee to my soul. Oh hapless Ivan! How shall I arm my tongue, how frame my words, How tell thee, that, this day th'usurper comes Haply to question thee, and doom to exile My honour'd lord, Naritzin? How prepare thee (If but Naritzin aid the general voice) For freedom, sov'reign'ty, orâtorturing death? Thou! whose high will man's errant thought o'errules, Guide me aright! Ivan. [asleep.] No: they will trace our foot-steps. Avoid me. Look, how slow yon monk steals on. Fie on thee! Shame! A lye on holy lips! Ha! gone. The swoln wave circles o'er his head: They cannot torture him. Pet. His frame, methinks, High-labours, and his features, e'en in slumber, Have lost their winning mildness. Ivan, wake. Ivan. [asleep.] I cannot bear those instruments of torture. All, I confess it all. The monk seduc'd me. Oh mercy, mercy, heav'n? Pet. Ivan! wake. Ivan. [confused.] Ha! Is it thou, Petrowna: none but thou? Pet. There is none else. Ivan. I pray you, turn your lamp There, steadily. No ray of light there gleams. It may be lurking there. Pet. 'Twas but a dream: I heard thee, in thy sleep; forget it all. Here is thy food, and I may yet remain Some little time. Ivan. Oh, ever kind, most welcome! The visionary shapes that vex'd my slumber, Have in thy presence vanish'd all: not so This horror at my heart: unwonted gloom Here presses like reality. Petrowna, May I disclose it to thee? It would sooth, Methinks, my woe, yetâit will pain thy bosom. The sufferings I endure weigh heavy on thee. How shall I thank thee? Pet. Give me all thy woe, So thank Petrowna. Ivan. [alarmed.] Does not that lamp pass wavering by thee? Pet. Ivan! Ivan. [motioning with his hand.] So it past wavering by me. Oh, Petrowna, It was no shadow, no unreal phantom, Such as oft haunt my troubled sleepâI saw it Distinctly, as now flaming thereâlast night, (The day and night to me, alas, are one, One ceaseless misery:) at the stroke of midnight, As on my couch I laid me down, that lamp Past on before me, wavering, as borne By some invisible arm. Behind it stalk'd With pond'rous tread, a form of giant stature. I could not trace its features. In its hand A poniard gleam'd: and, ever and anon, A shroud that reek'd with blood-drops, floated round it. On me, the murderer sprung: yet, yet I hear His hideous yell: I feel his iron grasp. Butâere the blade descended, while I writh'd Beneath th'o'erpow'ring fiend, thou camestâ Pet. [interrupting.] I! Ivan. Such as I see thee now, with seraph brightness Illumining the gloom, and beaming on me Rays of celestial pity. Say, Petrowna, Wert thou thyself then near me? Pet. Noâmy son: Heed not these shadowy dreams. Ivan. Not so, Petrowna, For thrice I laid me down, and thrice the lamp Past on, and ever more that form gigantic Thro' all that long, long night, before me tow'r'd. And, when worn out with misery, at late hour I sank in slumber on my flinty couch, Strange visions of past sufferings in my dreams Confus'dly mingled. Pet. Then I woke thee. Ivan. Yes, Most kindly: and all vanish'd at thy presence, Save this strange gloom, this horror at my heartâ Give me thy hand. Pet. Thy fever'd hand is fire: And now the chill fit shakes thee. Ivan. Raise me upâ My limbs sink under me. Support me. [Looking earnestly on her.] Ha! Petrowna! on thy eye-lid The tear-drop trembles: why, why turn away? Sure more than wonted gloom fills all the cell, Or, if I rightly see, unwonted paleness Has blanch'd thy cheek. Do not conceal aught from me. All I can bear, all suffer, save the pang That preys on thee in secret. Pet. 'Tis for thee Alone I feel, feel all a mother's woe. Oh, Ivan! calm thy soul: call heav'n to aid thee. The tongue of slander has traduc'd Naritzin: Rimuni has accus'd him: and Galinovitz O'er thee holds charge; my urgent pray'r has mov'd him. I know his secret soul, it honours theeâ Ivan, be calm. This day, to these sad haunts, The minionâbase Rimuni, andâthe Empressâ Ivan. [interrupting her.] Th'usurper! the fell fiend, who wears my crown? Pet. Awhile forego these thoughts: no pow'r can save thee, If such rash words reach other ear than mine. This day, the Empress comes to doomâI fearâ My lord to exileâandâit may beâIvanâ We ne'er shall meet again. Ivan. Ye light'nings, strike her! Pet. Oh give me patient hearing! It may please The sov'reign in her pride to look on theeâ Ivan. [interrupting.] Oh never will her stern eye look again On Ivan living. Pet. Yetâif such her will, Be mild, be gentle, then the menacing storm May pass away unfelt. Ivan. I will obey thee. Would that I ne'er again might see that fiend! Noâlet me but behold her, but in day-light Stand up, and front to front, pour in her heart The gather'd fire that inwardly consumes me: Thenâdie. Her gaze of insult shall not rest Triumphantly on Ivan. Pet. I implore thee, I urge thee, Ivan, by Petrowna's love, By years of unremitted tenderness, I do entreat thee by these tears that gush Like life-drops from my heartâ Ivan. [interrupting.] Say, what thy wish? Pet. That thou in presence of Elizabeth, Suppress thy indignation. Ivan. In her presence Conceal my just abhorrence! urge it not: I would not disobey thee. Pet. Else, at once Must perish all Petrowna's high-rais'd hopes. Ivan. Oh! I will kneel before her: sue for pity. Say, what thy hopes? Pet. To 'stablish thee once more, King on thy father's throne. Ivan. Can'st thou deceive me? Pet. Revolt rings round the isle. Where'er I past Before me burst the shout that bad Naritzin Raise thee to empire. While the weak usurper Leant on Naritzin's sacred word, my soul Supprest its ardourâbutâNaritzin wrong'd, Hope, that long slumber'd, like a giant springs Fresh from repose, and urges on to action. The glorious vision fires me: ne'er till now Has bold imagination dar'd to shape The righteous enterprize, that still deferr'd, Transfixt my heart with agony, and bath'd In secret tears my pillow. On Naritzin All now depends: and if my voiceâmy pray'râ If ere Petrowna's tears had pow'r to move him, Thy hand shall wield the sceptre. Ivan. [with dignity.] 'Tis my birthright. Pet. Rule thou the empire, in thy might extend A hallow'd sceptre o'er a willing realm, And fix the column of a nation's strength, A nation's glory, on the immoveable base Of private virtue: be, in blessing, blest: So rightly execute the awful trust Of heav'n's anointed. Ivan. Andâoh bliss of bliss! To be the minister of grace and mercy, To lighten the sad load of human woe, To rescue the oppressed, to search out The world-abandon'd orphan, and the mourner Who sighs in secretâand, then say, âCome forth! âView, in your king, a fatherââThis, Petrowna, Is to be God on earth. Pet. Oh King of Kings, Who in the soul of Ivan hast infus'd A portion of thy spirit, guard from wrong His sacred life! [To Ivan.] Have confidence in Heaven. I may not longer here remain unblam'd. Farewell! forget me not: before th'usurper, Remember thou thy promise: in her presence Be gentle, be submissive. Ivan. 'Tis thy bidding, I will bow down before her. Pet. Nowâfarewellâ Ivan. My motherâ Pet. My beloved son, farewell! [Exit. END OF ACT THE SECOND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Hall of Council. The Empress on her throne. Rimuni, Senators, Guards, &amp;c. Rimuni. Rim. Hear me, my royal mistress! I entreat you: Add, I beseech you, lords! your voice to mine, Let not Naritzin dare profane your presence, Let not the traitor wound his sovereign's ear With insolent speech! Emp. No more; my word is pledg'd: A monarch's word is sacred. 'Tis the grace Of sovereignty, its attribute, its blessing, That Mercy's angel-hand should still incline The scales by Justice pois'dâ Rim. Naritzin never Will sue for mercy.âI entreat you, hear us: Recall your wordâ Emp. No; be his speech most harsh, 'Twill be less poignant far than self-reproach. And, sir, his former services still live Warm in my memory.âBe my will obey'dâ Summon Naritzinâ [Herald introduces Naritzin. You, my lord Rimuni, Search out his guilt.âYet, first, Naritzin, hear me; Deem not thy sovereign, one who in the hour Of injur'd majesty, no more retains The sense and memory of deeds long past Of loyalty and love.âSay, âI have wrong'd you: âYour mercy I implore, forgive th'offence:â And thou shalt find that in this injur'd bosom Mercy doth temper justice. Narit. Gracious sovereign, For those whose conscience inwardly condemns them, For guilt which dreads its doom, reserve thy mercy: Justice alone I claim.âMy lord Rimuni, Of what am I accus'd? Rim. Thou didst project Ivan's escape. Day after day, fresh rumours Disturb the court with tales of Ivan's flight, And Ivan's friends. For, never yet were wanting, How light soe'er the scepter'd hand that rules, Men prone to discontent, and prompt to fill The realm with kindred slaughter. Such the charge: To this make answerâ Narit. What reports unvouch'd, What slander's breath may circulate round courts, I scorn to answer. Yetâ[to the Empress.] I pray your patience! May I proceed? Emp. At pleasureâ Narit. I must date From years long past: and, if my speech, perforce, Tracing time's course, and manifold events, Should lightly touch on trivial services Heav'n pleas'd that I should render to the state: Pardon the mentionâ Emp. It shall aid thy causeâ Narit. My ancestry is known unto you all; My fathers, in their day, for pow'r, for valour, For loyalty renown'd.âScarce had I gain'd My sixteenth year, when first, at glory's voice, Fir'd by the Emperor's fame, I drew my sword. There are, amid this senate, who beheld What battles then I fought, what sieges serv'd, Ere Nystadt seal'd our conquests. Emp. Your brave deeds Enrich our country's annals. Narit. In those wars I gain'd, not lightly won, the Emperor's love: And his fam'd guards,âtho' then the manly down Had scarce my cheek embrown'dâobey'd my word. The Emperor, whose course was like yon sun Illumining the world beneath its sway, Died in his glory. I pass o'er untold The sovereigns, each in turn, who held the sceptre, Till Anne bore rule. Anne nam'd her successor Her elder sister's grandson, then an infant, The prisonerâIvanâMay it please your highness To state what follow'd; what Naritzin's service? My guilt, if such disloyalty be guilt, I freely will discloseâ Emp. [rising.] No trivial serviceâ My glowing heart shall gratefully proclaim itâ When Ivan lay an infant in his cradle, And the whole realm was tumult, Lord Naritzin Felt all a patriot's zeal, a patriot's dread, Lest this our glorious empire, by the toil Of Peter rais'd, and by his blood cemented, Should under foreign faction, and weak sway Of those misguided rulers, Ivan's parents, Be wreck'd, and crumbled to a petty state. The public voice call'd Peter's offspring forth, Call'd me to wield the sceptre: I obey'd: And boldly to the throne my claim advanc'd. At dead of night when I address'd the guard To vindicate my rights, when round me clamor'd Tumult and madd'ning fury, when in vain I lifted up, to awe th'infuriate throng, That consecrated cross, then, lord Naritzin Dwelt on my father's fame, and crown'd my browâ Why hast thou forc'd on me th'ungrateful office To hear thy guilt? Does then thy heart no more Glow at the name of my immortal sire, Nor honour in the sovereign of thy choice His living image? Narit. Still my soul adores The memory of your sire, and thus [kneels] in you, Reveres his hallow'd image. Emp. [with warmth.] On thy faith I firmly rest. They falsely have accus'd thee; Break up the senate.âReassume thy honours: Resume thy governmentâ Narit. First, yield me hearingâ Rim. It may import your throne, my royal mistress! Emp. Do not detain me. Narit. I must pour before you The anguish of my soul, and speak of Ivan, That hapless princeâ Rim. Prince!âRebel! Narit. On thy head That word, base traitor!âThou, who hast misus'd Thy sovereign's favour, else, Naritzin's claims, And Ivan's piercing cry had reach'd the throne. Oh miserable realm! whose ruler yields Th'entrusted rights and duties of the sceptre To smooth-voic'd sycophants! [addressing Rimuni.] Behold our realm, That once by Peter's god-like soul exalted Towr'd proudly eminent, as stateliest pine, That rooted on the ice-cleft rock, out-braves The war of winds, and from its brow majestic Show'rs into dust impalpable, the weight Of winter's snows: now droops beneath the gloom Of luxury and sloth!âVoluptuousness Has mildew'd its fair growth, stern tyranny Lopt each brave shoot, and foul corruption chang'd Its sap and vital nutriment to poison Circling thro' all its viens.âRimuni, dread An injur'd nation's vengeanceâ Rim. [to the Empress.] If my zeal Ere won thy favour, let my word confound The traitorâ Emp. Noâ[aside.] His just rebukeâI feel itâ Plants daggers in my heart. You spake of Ivan; Proceedâ Narit. At this Rimuni's stern command, When savage hands had rack'd the hapless Ivan, When his dire wrongs rang loud on every tongue, And the deep woe that fill'd each heart, in mine Was guilt and condemnation, then, before me, Like a tormenting spirit, day and night The image of the unoffending victim, The heir of empire, by my pow'r dethron'd, Lone, in the unsunn'd dungeon, chain'd, in tortures, Before me rose: nor ever ceas'd the sting Of conscience here to lodge its gather'd venom, Till the sharp goading of remorse compell'd me, In expiation of th'offence, to claim This dreadful charge, and here to dedicate To solitude and sad obscurity, The closing of a day whose dawn was gloryâ Yet, wholly not unblest, so Heav'n vouchsaf'd me To shield the helpless from the oppressor's wrong, And, haply, soothe, if aught on earth might soothe, The suff'rings of the wrong'd, the outrag'd Ivan. Rim. Wrong'd, outrag'd Ivan! Lords. Treasonâ Emp. Peace, be silentâ I too have human feelings, human pity. Narit. Outrag'd! I spake the word. Look at this charge, [takes a paper from his bosom. I would not, for thy sake, my gracious mistress, Before the public eye produce this deedâ Once, when I claim'd the charge of Ivan, once I by constraint perus'd itâ Emp. Lord Rimuni: Read itâ Rim. Compel me not, my gracious Empress! Bid me not speak what wisdom would conceal, Nor deeds recal that after lapse of years By seeming harshness, may too rudely wound Thy gentle nature. Emp. Thou dost wrong thy sov'reignâ My lord Naritzin! this imports thy honour: Proclaim aloud the charge, that all may judge, Blame or applaud thy conduct. Narit. [reads the charge.] âGuard this Ivanâ âClose fetter'd in a dungeon's cell immure him, âFar from the light of day, and every eye, âSave thine. Such food as nature craves, be his. âHis mind is brutalis'd: by means that tame âThe stubborn brute, subdue his savage mood.â Emp. It bears thy signature, thy name, Rimuni. Narit. Would that no other name that deed subscrib'd! Emp. My name! oh heav'nâ I will'd that Ivan should be close immur'd, Not harshly tortur'd. Narit. [kneels.] Hear me! Emp. Wherefore kneel? Arise. Narit. Vouchsafe me audience. If this hand First crown'd your brow, if first I hail'd you, Empress, Have pity upon Ivan. From this scroll Blot out the stain and character of blood. Not of that fiend, of thy own heart take counsel: Then, in the splendour of your sire's renown His sceptre wield. And oh permit that Ivanâ The wrong'dâthe outrag'dâunoffending Ivan, May in some cloister's sanctuary pass Life's tranquil day: the peace, the public weal, The throne's stability, your sacred life, Claim justly such restraint: but all beyondâ Ruthless oppression. Rim. Dar'st thou thus proclaim it Before thy sov'reign's presence? Narit. Sir, I speak Under the terror of no earthly pow'r: [pointing up.] There reigns my judge. Emp. My lord Rimuni, silence. Narit. If, haply to have sooth'd by tenderest cares Him whom my pow'r dethron'd, be deem'd a crime, Be on my head that guilt! the blest offence Will whisper peace to my departing soul. The cell, 'tis true, has Ivan's dwelling been, Nor other eye than mine, save one on earth, Has ever glanc'd upon him. Rim. Ha! anotherâ Mark'd you his word, dread sov'reign? Emp. [to Naritzin.] Who? declare it. Narit. Petrowna. From her lip, day after day, E'en in the tomb that sepulchres the living, Ivan has learnt the words of wisdom, learnt How best to temper passion, and imbib'd The balm of heav'nly solace which religion Mingles in misery's chaliceâ Rim. [interrupting him. Aside to the Empress.] The brute Ivan, Of cultured reason! 'Tis most perilous. Not vain the warning. Were this widely rumour'd, Were it but whisper'd in the public ear, The realm would rise in arms. My gracious Sov'reign! Bid hence the senate. I beseech you, hear me. Emp. My spirit is sore troubled. Rim. I entreat you, Let me dismiss them. Loyal tho' they seem, They must not share this counsel. Emp. Bid them hence. Rim. My lords! awhile retire. [The Senate and Naritzin depart. Emp. What now thy counsel? Rim. It was no idle rumour reach'd your throne Of Ivan's followers, and projected rescueâ All is confirm'd. Andâbut you do not heed meâ Emp. Be brief. Rim. Your throne, your sacred life's at hazard. Be judge yourself: before you, face to face, Bid forth the boy, and witness what his nature. His nature! Who can doubt it? Aptly tutor'd: All mildness! All submission! But beware! Sudden, in full-grown strength, mature for vengeance The lion from his secret lair will spring, And crush you in his furyâ Emp. YesâI dread him. Rim. Were the boy dead, then would your soul know peace! There areâI know the man, whose loyal zeal Would rid you of that fear. Emp. By murder? Neverâ Rim. Youâor the boy. Emp. Oh heap not on my soul That added guilt. Rim. Think not Rimuni's nature Inclines to deeds of blood. The sacred duty To guard your life compels me. Emp. Spare meâspare me. Rim. I wish not Ivan's death: but say, where breathes On earthâI do not know that living manâ On whom my soul in fearless confidence Can rest such perilous charge. Emp. Yes. One I know In whom I firmly trust. Rim. Then I conjure you, Bind on his soul by heav'n-attested vows, This solemn charge, to stab without remorse The boy, if fraud or force attempt his rescue. Till then, as wont, within th'imprisoning cell Closely immure him. Emp. 'Tis most wisely counsell'd. Bid lord Naritzin in yon cloister's cell Attend my summons. Rim. Lord Naritzin! Emp. Speed. Bid him there wait my presence. And, I charge you, At hazard of my deep displeasure charge you, Let none approach the spot. My will is fix'd: Reply not: be thy sov'reign's word obey'd. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Cave of the Conspirators. Conspirators. Mirovitz. Feodor. Con. [to Mirovitz.] Detain us not. Most dangerous this delay. Now fix the hour: give each his separate charge. Butâif you doubt our wordâ Miro. [interrupting him.] I doubt you not. Con. Onâto the altar lead us: There pledge our souls to Ivan's cause, there bind us To slay whoe'er withstands his sov'reign's rescue. Behold us fix'd. Miro. Hear then my last resolve. You know the tyrannous custom of this fort, Month after month, fresh troops the isle surround, And night by night, new guards keep watch and ward Round Ivan's cell. This night that charge is ours. I, when the hour strikes twelve, relieve the watch. Now, one by one, pledge your brave hands with mine. You, [selecting two in turn.] guard the outward draw-bridge: you, the gates Of the first tow'r: the iron draw-bridge, yours: Your charge, the inner fort: you, guard the vaults That wind thro' ways obscure to Ivan's cell: You, bold Truwarotz, and brave Voronetz, You, at his cell take station: thine, my brother, The eastern turret: o'er its crested browâ Be watchfulâIf all favour our design, At stroke of one, a lighted beacon raise; Wave it distinctly thrice:âat the third signal We rush to Ivan's cave, and force our entrance If aught our way oppose. A sail now waits My summons, o'er Ladoga's lake, to waft us To liberty, to wealth, to fame, to honour. [Exeunt. END OF ACT THE THIRD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Cloisters. Empress and Naritzin. Emp. My lord Naritzin, on thy faith I rest: I shall pour forth, as truth and nature urge, My secret soul before thee. Oh! I would That I had never wielded in this hand The sceptre reft from Ivan! Since that hour, However outwardly I bear my pomp, And arm my brow with confidence, within Fear and suspicion that nor day nor night Have rest, possess me. I, by violence The empire seiz'd: declare what voice has pow'r To say in accents that may win assent, âGo, be at peace, repose thou in thy strength, âNor dread the avenger.â Narit. Whom have you to fear? Emp. My successor. I gave the dire example. Yet more, I dread thy charge, the prisoner Ivan. But yesterday I did despise the boy, I rank'd him with the very herd that crop The grassy clodâThy voiceâthe senate heard itâ Profusely blazon'd forth his praiseâThe realm Once hail'd him king, and I before him bow'd, First of his titled slaves. Narit. You are his sovereign, And on your word his weal or woe depends. Give him to breathe the air that breathes on all, And gaze upon the blessed light of heav'n. Mistake me not, it is not my request That you should rashly free him to the gaze And shout of the capricious people. No: Let him have commerce with religious men, Where he may safely harbour: bind his soul By rigid vows all dedicate to heav'n: And to the general voice that shouts thy name, Ivan will add his blessing. Emp. No, I dare not: Young as he is, and beautiful, and mild, Compassion for his fate would gather strength That must o'erturn my throne. I dare not free him: Yet I would fain that Ivan breath'd in peace. Thou can'st secure itâ Narit. How? Emp. 'Tis in thy power That he shall breathe the air that breathes on all, And gaze upon the blessed light of heav'n; And that his limbs bow not beneath their weight, Wanting free space to move in. I dare trust But thee alone. E'en in thy crime confest, Thy treason, disobedience, I remark'd A sense of duty that did shame the vaunt Of smooth court flatterersâIs it thy desire To lighten Ivan's misery? Narit. By my ownâ Emp. Naritzin, reassume the charge of Ivan: Assuage his misery: where'er thou art, Throughout the day, long as thou hold'st the rule Of this dread fort, be at thy side the youth E'en as a son most lov'd: yet, still at night-fall Closely immure him in th'imprisoning cell. This be his lot, so thou yon heav'n attest That thy firm hand shall in his bosom plunge This weapon, [presenting a dagger.] if or fraud or force again Attempt his rescue. Narit. I refuse the charge. Emp. This sacred dagger at Pultowa sav'd My sire, thy lord, from death: this now shall save His daughter, by thy patriot zeal enthron'd. Narit. Recall thy pardon, reassume thy honours, Forget the vow that never blood should stain Thy sceptre, be Naritzin's bold disloyalty By death aveng'dâI will not touch that dagger. Emp. Reflect, a thousand arms, a thousand daggers Will vindicate thy sovereign: force me not On deeds of blood: fain would my soul avoid them. Thy sovereign sues, commands thee. Take it, [the dagger.] Ivan Lives but to bless Naritzin: thy refusal Is Ivan's instant death. Narit. Not on my head Be innocent blood! Emp. [to a guard without.] Bid Lord Rimuni hither. Narit. A moment's pause. I know his ruthless nature. Emp. Bid Lord Rimuni hither! Speedâ Narit. Yet, stayâ Rimuni or Naritzin now shall perish. Pledge but your word, and I accept the charge. Emp. What thy intent? Narit. Your fame, a nation's wealâ Swear, ere another sun shall light the world, For ever from th'indignant realm to banish Rimuni. Are you silent? Plunge the dagger, Murd'ress, in Ivan's heart: so to your grave Go down with charge of blood upon your brow: So, in your sin, at heav'n's dread call, arise Before the King of kings. Emp. Ere yonder sun Resumes his course, Rimuni flies the realm. Take thou this weapon. [he takes it.] Narit. Ivan shall not reign. Emp. Receive thy sovereign's thanksâo'er populous Ingria Thy government extends. Narit. I seek no honours. As yet thou art unstain'd [drawing the dagger.] with innocent blood. Let me depart. Emp. Yet hear meâStayâThy sovereign Ere sun-set quits the isle: but, ere I leave These scenes for ever, My lord, I must hold conference with Ivanâ Nar. Not, I implore you, ere you have made known Your purpose to Petrowna. Emp. Why? Narit. Her voice Tempers at will his spirit: her fix'd glance Holds magic influence o'er him. Emp. Say, her sov'reign Commands her to her presence. Narit. I beseech you, With tenderness, with pity, question Ivan. And, I implore you, spare Petrowna's ear The charge of murder: hide from her the vow That past my lip. From Ivan's doom'd assassin, Her eye would turn abhorrent. Emp. Trust my cautionâ Haste! bid her hither. [Naritzin goes.]âHa! her voice, her glance Hold magic influence o'er him! 'tis most palpable! Tutor'd by her! and who but this Petrowna Has Ivan's misery sooth'd? his weal, his woe, Not mine, her spirit sways. My throne, my life, Rests on this woman: 'tis most hazardous. The boy now ripens into man, with manhood, Ambition, vengeance, his acknowledg'd claim To rule, will rouse ungovernable thoughts. All must be plainly told; the husband's vow Must yoke the wife; so shall Petrowna quench Each latent spark that glows in Ivan's bosom, And I in peace repose. Petrowna enters. Pet. My lord Naritzin Bade me attend your presence. Deign, accept My thanks, how due! that once more on Naritzin His sov'reign's favour rests. Emp. On his obedience, My favour rests. Pet. Yet not th'entrusted charge, Nor gifts, nor high rewards, nor added honours, Have smooth'd his brow. Methought, unwonted gloom Darken'd his cheek, as swift he hurried on To hide in loneliness thoughts ill at ease. Emp. I know the cause: and it doth much import thee To feel its force. His sov'reign to his pray'r Bow'd gracious, when thy lord, at once to lighten The doom of Ivan, and to drive Rimuni For ever from this realmâ Pet. [interrupting her.] Belov'd Naritzin! Heav'n on thy head its choicest treasures show'r! Emp. Vow'dâto prevent by deathâthe prisoner's flight, If fraud or force should ere attempt his rescue. You mark my words. Pet. Too plainlyâmurder Ivan. Emp. His vow is ratifi'd in heav'n. Pet. Sayâratherâ Where demons howl in torture. Emp. Hear, Petrowna! Thy sov'reign speaks. Pet. Naritzin murder Ivan! It shall not be. Emp. Fain would I see the youth: Hold converse with him: and myself observe If rumour vilely has degraded him To the low level of a senseless brute: Or, as Naritzin vaunted it, if Ivan Be grac'd with high endowments. Pet. [aside.] Oh my soul! 'Tis as I fear'd. Her eye shall not glance on him. If fear can curb, or pity melt the heart, They shall not meet. [To the Empress.] You once did look on Ivan: Andâyou rememberâthe wide realm yet dwells On that heart-rending scene. The very soldiers Wept, they who crown'd you, when their rude hands cast The infant, sweetly lock'd in cradled slumber, Beneath thy throne: they wept who heard the shout Of thousands, at whose uproar, Ivan woke, Stretch'd out his little hands, and oft-time clapt In sign of transport. Then thy cheek was seen To bow o'er his, and on his smiling lip Thy tears perforce gush'd down, while round thy neck, (As thine had been the breast that nurtur'd him,) His innocent arms were twin'd. Emp. 'Tis ever present, It troubles my night-vision. Why recal it? Pet. Poor Ivan was not then a senseless brute. Sore misery has marr'd the loveliest being That ere kind heav'n gave birth to. Fell barbarians! Fiends that they were to root out Nature's flow'r, And plant their weeds envenom'd in its place! Do not again look on him. Emp. Why dissuade me? Pet. By the remembrance of that moving scene, By dread of horrors that may yet ensue, If there be pow'r in words to change the will, Thou shalt not look on Ivan. Emp. Not look on him! Pet. Where? on what spot of earth would'st thou confront him? Emp. I understand thee not: explain thy meaning. Pet. Where meet him? In the cell that drinks his groan? Emp. Noârather in the sepulchre of death. Pet. Here? In the light of day? Beneath heav'n's beam Canst thou with still unswerving look, sustain The light'ning of his eye when fix'd on thine? Do not again behold him. Emp. Here conduct him. Pet. Oh never, never more thy tear will fall As once upon his cheek. Emp. Oh! Pet. Thou hast reign'd Triumphant; revelry, and joy, and feast, Shouts of applause, and all that earth most envies, Have made thy throne their dwelling. Think on Ivan. Do your tears fall? turn not away: they fall, Accepted offering to offended heav'n: And every tear mingled with penitence, Will wash and cleanse from off thy secret soul, A spot of deep pollution. Nature form'd thee Kind, gentle, generous. Emp. Presumptuous woman! What prompts thee, rashly daring, to address Thy sov'reign thus? Pet. At midnight, I have wept O'er Ivan's flinty couch, and quak'd to hear, When all was still, his shriek of agony: 'Tis this that makes me bold, and bids my voice Thus warn you: hold not conference with Ivan. Emp. Hear, and obey my word. A secret mystery Perplexes all. I will enquire and judge. Petr. [Aside.] 'Tis vain to move her.âIs then thy intent That hapless Ivan should before thy senate Appear, that those harsh men should probe his weakness: Or thou alone confront him? Emp. I, aloneâ Pet. 'Tis perilousâ Emp. Unfold thy meaningâSay too, (For thou no doubt hast aptly taught the boy,) What are his rare endowments? Pet. Heavn's best gift, The heart's warm sympathies that render back Kindness for kindness, love for loveâNot vainly In fruitless lore I wasted the brief hour Allotted to console him: yet, I taught him, ('Twas all I taught, for I did rate his life But at a moment's hazard) to o'ercome Calamity by patience, to repose In confidence on heav'n, and to resign Not unprepar'd, unwarn'd of violent death, His soul without a murmur unto God. So have I rear'd him. Yet, at timesâ Emp. Why silent? Pet. Are there not wrongs and dreadful sufferings Whose very mention, in each human bosom Stirs righteous indignation? Hence, I dread What may ensue, Ivan and thou, aloneâ At sight of her who from his temples reft The crown his fathers wore, whose stern command Has robb'd his day of light, whose ruthless ministers Have rack'd his tender limbs, will not the fiend Rouse him to madd'ning horror? Thou hast heard itâ If then instructed thus in Ivan's nature, Thy will is fix'd to commune lonely with him, I must not be far distant. Emp. I will see him. [Petrowna goes. Lead Ivan hither. Speedâawayâreply not. How is it with me? What strange fear appalls? Where'er I turn, some victim of oppression Starts up, methinks, before me, and aloud Cries vengeance.âEre yon westering sun descends I will depart: I would not here be found When nature seeks repose.âHark, hark, a footstep! No, 'twas my fear. Why did I wish to see The injur'd Ivan? What is my intent? That I myself should witness what his nature? How judge, when terror fills my inmost soul? I hear them: 'tis a footstep: it draws nearâ Oh spirit of my father! be thou present, Sustain thy drooping child! Pet. [behind the scenes.] Ivanâ Emp. I hear her: It was Petrowna's voice: how mildly sweet! So a fond mother welcomes in her child. Pet. [behind the scenes] Lean on meâdo not lingerâGaze no more On yon bright orb. Ivan enters, looking back, leaning on Petrowna. Ivan. Was that the blessed sun That lights the spacious world? Yon orb of fire? Say, can you stilly gaze on it, Petrowna, With unaverted eye? Mine it o'erpow'rs: All, all is darkling round me. Oh support me! Pet. Lean closer on me. Ivan. Tho' it pains my sight, Let me again behold it! Pet. Turn not, Ivan! The Empress is before you. Emp. [aside.] Hapless youth! How hast thou suffer'd! Ivan. Oh that piercing air! You said it would be pleasant to my sense: But it comes shivering over me, keenly chill: Yet is its breath most sweet. Aid me, Petrowna! My limbs sink under me. I pray thee, hide me In the dark dungeon. Let me not behold her. Pet. Remember thou thy promise; kneel, implore Her mercy. Ivan. 'Tis thy willâLead, lead me to her. Still on my sight the dazzling sun-beams flash. Where is the Empress? Emp. [aside, as Ivan slowly advances.] Fair indeed his form! Most beautiful! of growth beyond his years! Of port commanding!âIvan! Ivan. Whose that voice? 'Tis harsh unto mine ear. Speak, speak, Petrowna! Pet. The Empress graciously extends her hand In sign of kindness. I entreat you, Ivan, Implore her pityâ Ivan. I will kneel before herâ[kneels. Not for myself I sue thee. Hear my prayer! Emp. I am not of harsh mood. Witness these tears! Pet. [to the Empress.] Must I retire? Emp. Leave me not lone with Ivanâ Yet his no brutal natureâ Ivan. Scorn me not. Emp. I cannot longer gaze upon his face. Lead him away. Ivan. No, not till thou hast heard me. Emp. What would'st thou? Ivan. And hast thou the heart to ask it? Emp. Take, take him hence. Ivan. No; to thy knees I cling. None but thyself can give my bosom peaceâ I do entreat thee, as thou lov'st the heav'ns That on thy brow have show'rd felicity, Vouchsafe reply!âLive they, my wretched parents? Emp. They liveâ Ivan. And is their lifeâ Pet. [interrupting him.] Oh, ask no more! Ivan Like Ivan's? How! you answer not! Have mercy! Have mercy! 'Tis for me alone they suffer! For me they are deprived of air, of light, Of liberty. My crown is on thy brow: Wear it, and to thy successor, at will, Bequeath it.âBut, if thou have hope for mercy, Release poor Ivan's parents, and leave me To heaven and to Petrowna. Pet. Oh! assuage The anguish of his spirit! Emp. Hast thou, Ivan, No other pray'r? None for thyself? Speak freely: Nay, dread me notâ Ivan. What should I dread? Behold me. Emp. [aside.] Oh that the voice of truth had reach'd my throne! That I had known his gentle nature! [to him.] Ivan, It may import thee much, the truth declare, Has aught unwarranted by Lord Naritzin Ere in thy cell found entrance? Ivan. Dark and deep My dwelling, far from human sight and sound: And the sepulchral roof that closes o'er me The bound that parts the living from the dead. Emp. [aside.] It wounds my soul. Ivan. The elements alone In their illimitable sweep had pow'r To interrupt my solitude: and oft From unendurable loneliness arous'd, I have giv'n answer to the voice of winds That heav'd the roaring waves; and I have leapt In transport from my flinty couch, to welcome The thunder as it burst upon my roof, And beckon'd, to the light'ning as it flash'd And sparkled on these fetters: while in vain I proffer'd, where the volley fiercely blaz'd, My forehead to its death-stroke. Emp. 'Tis too horrible! Pet. No; not the roar of winds, the thunder's crash, The inward whisper of a guilty spirit Alone is insupportableâ Ivan. Yet, hear me! Not for myself I sue thee, 'tis for them My bosom bleeds, for them, my wretched parents, Imprison'd for my crime: the crime, that Ivan Was born to rule: waste not in vain lament, Waste not on me unfruitful tearsâI know My hapless doom, and am prepar'd to suffer. But, pity those who mourn the living Ivan, And call the day accurst, which gave to light Me, their first-born. Pause you? your silence killsâ Scorn not these tears!â Pet. I dread what may ensue. You heeded not his pray'r. Rage knits his brow. Ivan. Thou call'd a God on earth, hast thou no mercy? Pet. His agitated bosom labours high With violence unwonted. [To the Empress.] I exhort you, Avoid his sight. Emp. The voice of majesty Shall curb his rage. Ivan! Pet. Not thus address him: Not with loud voice of stern command! Hear, Ivan! Withdraw. [To the Empress.] His cheek is fire, his eye darts flame. Ivan. [to the Empress.] Withdraw! Emp. [on Ivan's approach.] He heeds thee not, Petrowna, Stand thou between us: 'tis thy sov'reign calls On thee for aid. Pet. Stay, Ivan! Ivan. [fronting the Empress.] Thou, the usurper! Is this the crowned brow? Let me behold it. I will confront its terrors. Who art thou, Mortal! that mock'st omnipotence? Who, thou, That in the hollow of thy right hand grasp'st Yon orb of light, and with thy left hast yok'd The freedom of the winds; and criest aloud, âSun! shine not thou on that devoted head! âNor let thy pure breath, unimprison'd air! âMake cool those fever'd temples!â Let me trace The signature and majesty of heav'n Stampt on thy front. Emp. [sinking on her seat.] HelpâI am faintâSupport me. Pet. IvanâHe hears me notâI ne'er have witness'd Such violence of rageâHe knows me notâ 'Tis past controlâ Ivan. [his passion gradually rises to frenzy.] Turn not awayâBehold me. What trace I on that brow? Woe, terror, shame. Where now thy pow'r, thy sov'reignty o'er Ivan? Usurper! from thy temples lift the crown, And fix it on my brow, and at my feet Seek pardon. Give the sceptre to my wielding. Mark its just useâHaste! ope the prison gates. Lo! how they issue forth, faint, pale, afraid To look upon the light! Lo! how they creep Bow'd down on the strange earth, like beings unus'd To gaze on heav'n with man's erected front! [to the Empress.] Art thou my mother? Oh! I knew thee not. Let me kiss off those tears that bathe thy cheek: They long have sever'd us. Come! to my arms! Oh shield me from that torturer! [Petrowna.] Shield thy chield! Pet. Ivan! it is Petrowna. Ivan. [struggling with her.] Off, barbarian! They ne'er shall part us more. [Embracing the Empress.] Come: you shall hear Strange tales of Ivan. To my prison stole A monk, a wily man: long years of suffering Have since toil'd by: and the swol'n waveâI saw itâ Foam'd o'er him. Mark how he allur'd my boyhoodâ He told me I should wander in green fields, And wreathe fresh flow'rs and garlands, where gay birds Sing in their bow'rs, and gurgling streamlets wind Thro' sun-shine glades their many-dimpled rills, Butâ'twas to plunge me deeper, deeper-down, In midnight darkness. [To Petrowna.] Hence, thou fiend! away! Why, why pursue me to this sunless cave? Is this too thy doom'd haunt? Emp. [to Petrowna.] Loose not thy holdâ Ivan. [to the Empress.] Weep not, dear mother? By thy tears I know thee; Haply thou know'st not Ivan: not this flesh So strangely mangled. 'Twas not thus, when first Thy tear of joy gush'd on the new-born babe. Butânever shall the torturers vex us more. Hush! hush! No ear must hear itâ'Twas Petrowna, Not that false monk, that spake of freedom, empireâ Hush! hush! Emp. Ha! Pet. Heed not! these are words of frenzyâ Emp. [to Petrowna.] Forget not the dread oath. Ivan. [to the Empress.] Nayâbe at rest. Cloud not thy brow. The usurper shall implore Forgiveness, and kneel prostrate at our foot-stool. Off, off, fell fiend! [to Petrowna.] Emp. Let him not 'scape thy arms. Ivan. I can no more resist. Strike not again. Pet. My son! He falls exhausted: [Ivan falls.] prone on earth. Ivan. Once: twice: they murder me in prison. Help! Strike at th'anointed brow. Beware, fell fiend! The eye of heav'n is on you. Pet. Ivan, Ivan! Hear, my beloved son! it is Petrowna, It is thy mother clasps thee in her arms. My voice has reach'd him. Ivan. [recovering.] Is it thou, Petrowna? A fearful vision had disturb'd my sense. Emp. Hide him from me for ever. From this isle I hasteâfarewell. Think on Naritzin's oath. [The Empress goes. Ivan. My limbs sink under meâsupport me. Pet. Ivan! Lean on me. In these arms once more find peace. END OF ACT THE FOURTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. An unfrequented spot nigh the Castle. Dark night. Rimuni, Altorf. Alt. My lord! here linger not: your doom is fix'd. Now, as the secret senate clos'd, I met Count Olbert. Speed, I pray, your instant flight, And underneath the night's propitious gloom Haste from the isle. The royal word has doom'd you To hopeless exile. Rim. Not behold me! Alt. Neverâ The Empress is inexorable. Rim. Ha! Alt. An oath, a sacred vow has bound her soul To drive you from her presence. Here delay notâ Ere the strong hand of pow'r arrest your flight, Speed, quit the isle. Siberia's wilds await you If but another sun behold you here. Naritzin is restored to all his honours, And with the charge of Ivan, added proofs Of royal favour court him. Rim. Court Naritzin! Then farewell hope! I charge thee, faithful friend, Let it be widely rumor'd that Rimuni Fled suddenly the isle. Farewell! [Altorf goes.] Naritzin! Thou first in favour!âBind by oath her soul To banish me for ever! Wayward woman! I will not crouch beneath the foot that spurns me. What then remains? Insatiate thoughts that prompt Stern deeds, and the unyielding spirit of vengeance That lays the oppressor low. 'Tis known to all That Mirovitz o'er Ivan holds the night-watch: Add tooâso will'd the usurperâthe whole isle Reels, surfeited with wine and revel feastingâ By heav'n! it must succeed, if Mirovitzâ And well I know his natureâaid my purpose. At the north rampart I will cross his roundâ Ivan shall reign, and this ingrate usurper Kneel slave-like at his footstool. [Exit. Scene, the North Ramparts. Mirovitz and Feodor enter. Feo. The midnight hour is past. Say, Mirovitz, Are all prepar'd? Mir. At one, we rescue Ivan. Success must crown the attempt. All now concurs, The guard, the day's late revels, this dark night. Look! how the dull moon labours in her course: Those vapours, streak'd with ruddy gleams, portend The gathering of the winds: and yon bleak clouds That thicken in the south, will quickly waft us To the lone isle; and say, what eye can note us? E'en those whose restless lids, unseal'd by slumber Ope at this hour, are all o'er-charg'd with fumes Of wine and riotous feast. Feo. But how deceive Naritzin's search? His unremitting zeal Visits throughout the fort, from cell to cell, The nightly watch. Mir. His unremitting zeal! How fruitless! All, e'en to suspicion's eye, Shall seem secure. The hour, the occasion urge: These now neglected, say, what hope hereafter? All now is fix'd, and years on years may pass Ere men so leagu'd here meet. It must succeedâ At the high altar I have bound their souls To free their king. Rimuni enters. Ha! at this hour, what spy Here basely lurks? Thy name, thy purpose, speak! Rim. RimuniâVengeanceâ Mir. 'Tis confirm'd, I know itâ That thou art, like myself, a man disgrac'd: The sunshine, whose meridian blaze illum'd thee, Is suddenly obscur'dâ Rim. For ever set. Yet not the less, e'en in the senate lurk Men to my will devote: brave men who scorn The weak usurper; lords of might and pow'r To 'stablish on the empire of his sires The sovereign of thy choice. Mir. My choice! Who? Rim. Ivan. Elizabeth is hateful to thy soul: Take my pledg'd hand. Perish Elizabeth! This night you hold o'er Ivan watch: this night The isle is all dissolv'd in revel feasting. Who, save Naritzin, can control our course? Command this weapon. I have basely wrong'd thee; Yetâif the galling yoke of dire oppression, The bond of common suffering can unite Brave men who brook not wrong, lo one whose hand Fears not to execute the boldest deed Thy spirit dares conceive. Miro. The proof awaits thee. Thou at my side attend; be bold, be faithful: If faithlessâlo thy doom. [drawing a dagger.] Go, Feodor, Speed to the eastern turret: at the stroke Of oneâbe vigilantâthe beacon raise: Wave it distinctly thrice. At the third signal We rush to Ivan's cell, and force our entrance, If aught our way oppose. Feo. I shall not failâ Farewell. [Feodor goes. Miro. Speed, hour of vengeance! if we fail, Better to perish boldly, than contemn'd, Live unaveng'd. Success or death awaits us. [Exeunt. Scene, Petrowna's Apartment. Petrowna. Pet. 'Tis horrible! premeditated murder! Fell fiend, to lodge thy poison in my heart, To force on me the secret, that Naritzin Has bound his soul, by solemn oath confirm'd it, To slay the innocent Ivan! How prevent it? Thy wrongs, oh Ivan! fill the realm with horror: And each new day, each hour in rapid flight, Engenders new revolts. Oh heav'n! I view Him whom I lov'd, rever'd, ador'd, a murderer, Spotted with innocent blood. Relentless demon, To link Naritzin to thy fell design! Our bond of love was interchange of souls, Each in the other center'd: how, how live In uncommunicating wretchedness! Hark! 'tis the tow'r's loud chime, [the chime heard.] 'twixt twelve and one. 'Tis past his wonted hour. Why stays Naritzin? Some unforeseen eventâperchanceâsome tumult! Merciful heav'n! Ho! [Calling the Guard. Guard. Did I hear thy call? Pet. Say, is thy lord return'd? Guard. No foot this night Has past the gate. Pet. Let Albert now go forth, And bid him speed, I charge you, and observe If all is peace and quiet. Bid him speed, And bring swift tidings of thy lord's approach. [Guard goes. Naritzin shuns my presence, and avoids, Bleak tho' the storm, and late th'ungenial hour, This sheltering roof. His painful charge, as wont, Urg'd him to visit in their cells, ere midnight, Th'entrusted prisoners. Has he look'd on Ivan? And told the victim that Petrowna's husband Is doom'd to shed his blood. Galvez enters. Galvez! most welcome, Where is thy lord? Gal. But now we cross'd the draw-bridge: I saw him slowly passing towards the castle. Pet. How! underneath this roof, and still avoid me? Say, was all peace and quiet on your round? No sight, no sound unwonted? Gal. All, methought, Seem'd tranquilâbutâ [A footstep heard. Pet. I hear his footstep. Hence. [Galvez goes. How solemn his approach! Naritzin enters, and lays down his sword and dagger. Narit. Thou here! oh heav'n! Pet. Late is the hour of thy return, and bleak The gales of night sweep round the battlements That crest the fort. You are o'er-tir'd, I fear: The chill breeze, and the night storm's ceaseless fury, Have sorely harass'd thee. Narit. I reck'd them not: 'Tis not the outward stormâ'tis hereâ'tis here. Pet. Come to thy rest. Nar. Thou too, at this late hour? Why art thou absent from thy peaceful chamber? I did not look to find thee waking, love, Or I ere now had urg'd my homeward step. I pray thee to thy chamber. Pet. Butâthou seem'st By misery opprest. I dread to ask theeâ YetâI beseech thee. In thy nightly roundâ Nar. Wherefore this silence? Pet. Say, was all secure? Narit. All seem'd secure. Pet. Butâwas there aught? Oh tell me? Narit. As I drew near the fort that guards the prisoners, Methought I heard the whisper of a voice, In utterance like Rimuni's. Butâin vain I search'd each spotâ'twas idle fancyâ Pet. Whispers! Andâutterance like Rimuni's! heav'n forefend! Yetâfor it closely presses on my soul, Tell me, Naritzin, when your search explor'd The prisoners dungeons, did you look on Ivan? Fain would I know, after this day of trouble, If calm his sleep. Narit. I left his cell unsearch'd. I could not interrupt poor Ivan's slumber. The innocent may sleep. Pet. Since last we parted, Hast thou of aught held conference with him? Narit. No. Pet. [in transport.] Then Ivan knows it not. Narit. Not know it? what? What words have 'scap'd thy lips? unfold their meaning? Pet. How! said I aught? oh heed it not! the tongue At times will murmur words devoid of sense. Narit. Give me, I pray, strict answer. Did the Empressâ Pet. [confused.] The Empress! Narit. Why thus troubled? did the Empress Discloseâ Pet. Oh peace! spare, spare me yet awhile. My spirit is within me bow'd and brokenâ My husband! we will talk of this hereafter. Oh! let us taste the blessing of repose, And to kind angels reconcile our thoughts, Ere deeper woe assail us. Do not linger: Sleep will not on my eye-lid shed its balm, While thou art absent. [Petrowna goes. Narit. Never on my lid Shall slumber shed the blessing of repose. 'Tis as I fear'd, the Empress has betray'd The fatal secret. Underneath the veil Of tempting words, e'en in Petrowna's smile, I noted the sharp pang that rack'd her soul. I am her bane and horror. Thro' the day Her eye will wither mine with frozen look, And in her dreams, her night-shriek will denounce Vengeance on Ivan's murderer. Of his crown I reft the innocent child: I now am doom'd With this infernal gift, to pierce his heartâ So, guilt engenders guilt, till, ripe for vengeance On the offender's brow, eternal justice Heaps retribution. Judge of heav'n and earth, Now ere this blade drops blood, in mercy strike me! Galvez hastily enters. Whence this intrusion? sayâ Gal. My lord, a soldier Seeks instant entrance. Narit. Hither quickly lead him. Galvez and Ortosk enter. Say, at this hour why seek me here? Ort. My lord! As on my watch I duly went my round, About the noon of day, I chanc'd to spy A boat beneath the fort, and on the shore An old man, and two youths, in guise, it seem'd, Of fishermen, who on the Neva earn Their bread by daily toil: as I approach'd (Awhile unseen) I heard their busy tongues: Words indistinct, save that I plainly noted Their conference was of Ivan. Narit. Oh beware! Mislead me not! Of Ivan! Ivan's woe, Ivan's sad tale is rife on every tongue. Ort. But there was further meaning in their words Than idle pity, or I mainly err. I warn'd them from that spot, and on I past So thought they, to my round: but close I watch'd them. Their skiff is moor'd, in secret, underneath The birch, whose hoar boughs overhang the flood: And, my day-duty done, I there observ'd them Watching the flight of the clouds, as men prepar'd Ere long to hoist the sail. Narit. Speed, trusty Galvez! My swordâthat dagger! Take thy weapons with thee. Soldier! attend us. Petrowna! 'tis for thee my bosom bleeds. Oh be deep slumber on her! Speed we forth To Ivan's cell. [They go. Pet. [behind the scenes.] Wherefore this long delay? Petrowna enters. It tortures me. My lord Naritzin? Gone. What ho! Who guards the portal? Soldier enters. Where is thy lord? Sol But now he past the gate. Pet. Alone? Sol. No, Galvez with him. Swift they sped: With them a soldier of the fortâ Pet. Lead on: To Ivan's cell. In thy good guard I trust. [They go. Scene changes to the outside of Ivan's cell. A gloomy vault feebly lighted. Naritzin, Galvez, Ortosk, enter. Narit. Soldier! on yon commanding bastion take Thy stand: that eminence o'erlooks the fortress: Note carefelly if aught unwonted strike Thy wary eye: and give me timely warning. [Stations him on the outside of the scene. I charge you, on your life, keep strictest watch. Galvez, there take thy stand: [Stations Galvez on the opposite side.] and, at my summons Speed quickly hither.âNot a soundâno motionâ Oh that the roar of winds, the crash of thunder Peal'd thro' these noiseless vaults! so might they silence These audible throbs, this tempest in my heart! There, Ivan! there thou slumber'st, [approaching the cell.] in yon dungeon. Now, when I visited the prisoners' cells, Each, one by one, tho' there my main charge lay, I could not break on Ivan's hour of rest. Thrice I drew near the cell, with full intent To warn him of my vow: My heart recoil'd Yet all must be reveal'd, or worse ensues. [He listens at the door of the cell. Soft; 'tis his hour of slumber. Why that sound? What do I hear? His deep groan strikes my ear: And now a quick and agitated step Rings on the echoing flints. Belov'd Petrowna! All hope of bliss with thee is fled for ever. Ivan must know his doomâIvanâ [calling loudly to him. Ivan. Who summons? Narit. [unlocks the cell.] Ah, hapless youth! the horrors of the day Yet haunt thy soul, and from thy eyelids drive Sleep's soothing balm. [Aside.] What then my charge accurst? Why art thou silent? Speakâ Ivan. Thy groans appal me. Oh gaze not on me, so. Narit. Look on me, Ivan: Thou art not wont to turn thine eye from mine. Ivan. Thy glance, methinks, streams fire. Why, at this hour, Say, what thy purpose? Yet I dread to hear. Why dost thou start? Why turn thine eye around As fearful of surprise? Narit. My heart is fraught Beyond its bearing. I have kindly us'd thee: Till now, beneath my rule, no word unkind Has ever reach'd thee, Ivan. Ivan. Thou hast been A friend, a father to me. Narit. How, how utter Words that hang curses on the tongue that speaks them? Yet, all must be reveal'd, all clearly told. Prepare to hear the vow that dooms this hand To murderâ Ivan. Whom? Narit. Thee, Ivan. Ivan. Thou, my father! Thy hand to murder Ivan! Narit. I have vow'd A terrible oathâ Ivan. I am prepar'd to die. Narit. But I am not prepared to murder thee. Ivan. Oh let me fling my arms around thy neck, There breathe the love I owe theeâ Narit. But, forgive me, Deep is my guilt. Oh had it pleas'd high heav'n Or ere thy birth, in mercy to have swept me From off the living land, thou, at this hour, King on thy throne had'st sway'd in righteousness The sceptre of thy sires, and I had lain In peace within the grave. Ivan. Come to my arms: Once more embrace me. Narit. [starting from his embrace.] What that sound? Ivan. I heard noneâ Narit. [half distracted with horror.] A foot-step: ha! away! no earthly pow'r, Shall force him hence.âHave I not sworn his death? Hear, fiend of hell! Ivan. Thick-gathering drops of sweat Fall from his browâ Narit. I heard itâhark, again A foot-step. It speeds on. Hence, traitors, hence. 'Tis hush'd, and all is peace. Ivan. 'Twas but the sound Of the lone sentinel, or gusty night-breeze Sweeping along the vaults. Narit. I must disclose it, While yet my voice has pow'râIvan, 'tis sworn: The solemn vow is ratified in heaven: No, to a fiend my plighted soul is bound That I will fix this dagger in thy heart Ere mortal man shall triumph in thy rescue. Yet, had I not so sworn, Rimuni's hand Ere now had stabb'd thee. [the tower-clock strikes one.] What that sound? Ivan. The tow'r Strikes one. [Galvez rushes in. Gal. My lord, as tow'rds the east I gaz'd, I saw a beacon on the topmost tow'r Distinctly wave: then, suddenly it vanish'd, And all was dark. Narit. Speed, speed, resume thy station: Observe again what passes. [As Galvez goes, a violent knocking is heard at the outside of Ivan's cell. Who thus knocks? Pet. [without.] It is Petrowna; haste, unclose the cellâ Ivan, unclose the cell. Ivan. Conceal that dagger. If thou must slay me, At her departure, fear not Ivan's struggle: My death-groan shall not reach Petrowna's ear. Pet. [without.] Oh do not murder him! unclose the cell. They come. On every side swift-gleaming lights Flash to and froâ Narit. [opens the cell and catches her in his arms.] Petrownaâ Pet. Horror! horror! NaritzinâIvanâwhither shall I turn? I know thy horrid vow: the demon told it. Come to me, Ivan. [Galvez rushes in. Gal. TreasonâI beheld The beacon torch thrice wave. [Ortosk rushes in. Ort. Come forth: arm'd men Rush tow'rds the prisoner's cells. Narit. Ring out th'alarum; Summon the guard. Petrowna to thy chamber. Horror and death surround the cell. Awayâ Ivan. If Ivan e'er was dear to thee, depart. Pet. I stir not hence. A mother's love defends him, My breast, his shield. [The alarum rings, the tumult of the Conspirators is heard. Mir. Force down the iron draw-bridge! Break, break the bars Rim. [without.] Rescue to Ivan!â Cons. [without.] Rescue! Narit. Not if this sword has pow'râGalvez, come forth! Soldier! desert me not. On, boldly on. [they hurry out. Pet. Naritzin! hear. Their multitude o'erpow'rs him, [clash of arms. They close him round on every side. Help, heav'n! [The Conspirators, with torches in their hands, led on by Rimuni, Mirovitz, and Feodor, drive back Naritzin and his friends. Rim. [encountering Naritzin.] Naritzin, 'tis Rimuni now defies thee. Narit. [defeats, and runs Rimuni through the body.] So perish in thy guiltâ Rim. Curse on thy arm. [dies. Miro. Ivan! come forth! 'Tis Mirovitz who calls you To freedom, vengeance, empire. Narit. [draws his dagger, and stands over Ivan, in act to strike him.] Never, never [To Ivan.] Thou must not live. Back, traitors! or this dagger Now strikes him dead. Pet. Oh do not shed his blood. Ivan. [to Narit.] Dread not in me resistance. Miro. [to Feodor.] Wrest the dagger To the Conspirators.] Think of your oaths. Rescue your sovereignâ Narit. [going to stab Ivan.] Never: While I have being. Miro. [wrests the dagger from Naritzin, and is in act to slay him.] Die then. Pet. [seizing the arm of Mirovitz, kneels to Ivan.] Save him, Ivanâ Defend Petrowna's husband! Ivan. [to Petrowna.] Be at peaceâ The wretched Ivan can no more sustain The anguish of thy soulâThus, thus, [snatches the dagger from Mirovitz, and stabs himself.] I end itâ Naritzin! none, save Ivan, could absolve thee From that fell oath: no other arm could rescue Those whom my soul most loves from ruthless vengeance. Petrowna now will bless me: and, Naritzin, Thou on thy death-bed may'st remember Ivan. Support me, oh I faint. Miro. [presenting his sword to Narit.] My hopes are blasted, I seek not mercy: take my sword, Naritzin; Death, instant death. Pet. Ivan, my son! look on meâ It is Petrowna's lip that breathes on thine. Ivan. My sight grows dim, my hand hath lost its hold: Support me: closer in thy arms enfold me! [Petrowna clasps him in her arms. Pet. Here, lay thy head. Ivan. 'Tis sweet to breathe my last On the sole spot where peace once dwelt with Ivan. [He dies, Petrowna faints on him. THE END.</field>
