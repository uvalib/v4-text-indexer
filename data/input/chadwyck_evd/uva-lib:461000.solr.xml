      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. It will be perceived, that the following Drama is not modelled according to the rules which custom has established: It is conformable, however, to those that have stood the test of ages, and to the principles of arrangement which the Author believes true to nature, and to which, in his future labours, he means to adhere. His ideas may be false, but experience appears to justify them; and as Authors, as well as the Public, continue to be influenced by the long disputed restrictions, still regarding every Drama as imperfect which is not formed on one great leading action, he may be allowed to state very shortly his reasons of dissent. He conceives, that as so many various passions and feelings sway the human heart, at the different periods of life, the Author who confines his Drama to the actions of a day, can only display each of his characters under the influence of that one passion, which predominates at the age, and in the particular circumstances, in which that individual may be placed. But when a tale or history is represented, then the Author has opportunities of tracing the effect of the various passions and affections of the human soul from one stage to another, and of depicting their minute and curious workings under every circumstance in life. It is in such delineations as these, that the feelings of an audience become truly interested; but these cannot be effected, unless the imagination of the Poet is suffered to roam at large from scene to scene, and from age to age, sketching every feature that is predominant or striking on nature's face, and selecting a flower wherever it may be found, from the wilderness or from the palace;—when he is authorized to lay open the book of nature at every page, instead of being restricted to one, and of showing to every age and sex something of themselves. We should never have seen a Richard or a Macbeth, had the Author confined himself to any single period of their lives. From these considerations, and a thousand others, the Author of this Drama has been thoroughly convinced, ever since he could either read a tragedy or attend to the representation of one, that a chain of interesting events connected with and arising out of one another, affords infinitely more scope and chance of success to the poet,—more opportunities to the actor, of displaying his powers in the representation of nature, and more interest and delight, whether to spectators or readers, than can possibly be produced, if the rules are adhered to which criticism and custom have established. In a word, that a tale is better calculated for dramatic representation, than any single event with its collateral appendages; and that the lovers of the Drama are affected only by the situations in which the characters represented are placed, disregardful of the lapse of time or any other subordinate relation. He has noted, that as learning and science have advanced, dramatic poetry has decayed, until the very spirit that breathed it seems to have deserted the land; and having long, with deep regret, seen the door standing open and the mansion deserted, he entered, but with fear and caution, and began the following, merely as an experiment in dramatic composition, and in the same way as he believes many of our ancient dramas were begun, without knowing where or how it was to end. Before he had got half through it, however, he thought of having it brought forward on one of the theatres of the Metropolis; but on showing it to a few select friends, who he knew could not be mistaken, he was persuaded that the innovations upon received custom were too palpable to be tolerated at once; and therefore determined not to offer it for representation, but, rather than risk the mortification of a refusal, or the still more painful one which every bad or perverse actor has the power of inflicting, to give it to the Public simply as it is,—an experiment, and a first essay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —Dark Mountains, &amp;c. Pavillion, and Tents. Enter Garnet and Kilmorack. Gar. This is a dull retreat!—What seek we here Amid this waste, where desolation scowls, And the red torrent, brawling down the linn, Sings everlasting discord? where the mists, Drizzly and dank, hang lingering on the bosom Of the bleak wilderness; and winter's flag, White as the speck upon the North's cold cheek, Scutcheons the hill for ever?—Are our minds Estranged from reason's guidance, thus to tilt Against each principle and bold appeal She makes to manhood?—Say, Duke Albany. Kil. Duke Albany! What do you mean? Beware. Gar. Sooth, I forgot, and ever shall;—these pranks Go sourly down with age. Tell me the cause Why we are here, and why our names are chang'd? I like not this disguise. Kil. I'll tell thee all:— These hills are wild, 'tis true; but the dun deer Run there in thousands—they are gloss'd and shy, Fleet and high fed; we shall have royal sport. And then the maids! the blooming mountain maids! Ah! they're so lovely! and so affable! 'Tis pleasant to be nigh them. Gar. I like the maids! Kil. Dost thou indeed, old warrior? I bless thee for it; but I fear the maids Will ne'er like thee. A lip so sweet as one Of Crawford, or of Campdale maidens, A graybeard must not mar.—Didst thou e'er see A fair green stem, in all its blushing hues, Cling to the bosom of a wither'd oak? Gar. Hence, scoffer, with thy jargon: Now I guess The drift of all this deft dissemblage,—vice! Kil. Call't not by name so hard; say love, Glen-Garnet. Gar. Heaven bar such love! Poor girls, they little ween What gins lie hid around them!—From the hall, The steading, and the cot, constant they look To see the green-coat hunter's stately form; Their fair blue eyes, like morning's softest beam, And ruddy lips, opening in cherub smile, Courting their own destruction!—I do fear This wicked hunt will teach to many a maid The grace of true repentance; and the art To sing the sob-broke lullaby full sweet O'er mid-day cradle!—Fie upon it! Now That I perceive your drift, I'll home again. Kil. 'Tis meet we take false names—things may be blabb'd At which our courtly dames at home would jeer. We're all unknown, and these wild northern names Will blind the country knights to our degree, Prove but our pages faithful.—Sure they must; Each has his rustic sweetheart too,—save one. Hast thou not noted one fair page, Glen-Garnet, Too lovely for a boy?—I have strange fancies, Which time will soon unravel.—Soft! Here comes The new redoubted Lord of Badenoch. Enter Badenoch. Hail, gallant brother! Thou sit'st king to-day, And we must wait thy orders. Sooth, yon aim I have not seen outdone. Bad. 'Twas a good hit, But marr'd a noble chase. The stag had sprung, Open'd at once the pack with notes so loud, The breeze of heaven was broke, and seem'd to roll In wavy folds, like billows of the ocean: The mellowed echoes so distinctly spoke, I ween'd that viewless beagles mouth'd the wind, And sung from every hill. Gar. Say how he reach'd The goal so soon. Bad. At first his horns I saw, Between me and the welkin, cut the wind; So swift, they whistled in't, and play'd and toss'd As light as the tall branchy fern, when wav'd By summer gale.—My heart with ardour heav'd! Anon he came, and belted the green hill Swifter than ever raven scoop'd the air! Proud of his matchless speed, he snuff'd the wind, And bore his brow so high, as he disdain'd The earth and heaven. I aim'd afar before him; Just in the shadow of his bawsin'd ear The arrow stuck—headlong he fell; then, rising, Bolted aloft in air, as he would scale The windows of the firmament. The bounds He made adown the steep were aimless quite; 'Twas the last burst of life; the last exertion. He founder'd oft, till in the mead below Grovelling he lay.—His slender limbs, convuls'd, Pawed the green sward, still struggling to proceed, But his fair head, disgrac'd and crimson-dyed, Refus'd to leave its flowery pillow more. Kil. He shall be mated. With the Lord of Crawford We hunt to-day. If the dun deer do sleep, And if their sleep is haunted, Crawford hinds This morn may quake in sad foreboding dreams. Bad. I dream'd of one last night, and she alone; I hope she dream'd of me. Kil. Ah! well I noted Your glances to Lord Crawford's blooming bride, And her's to you.—But, brother, pray beware: I know him well; he's brave and generous, But passion's self is not more violent.— His love, his hate, revenge, and jealousy, Run in extremes: And he is jealous, trust me, Of you and his fair spouse. Bad. O, for her! if I gain her not, I die— Gar. What? The earl's own wife?—you will not— Bad. Or die of love—my heart is on the rack. Gar. What is't you would?—say, wilt thou bear her off, And marry her a second time?—or—surely not! You wont seduce her? Bad. Wont I?—Art thou serious? Thou once wert young like me—In those sweet days When pleasure beckon'd thee with seraph smile, And passion urg'd thee on, did no sweet maid, With burning cheek, and eye more moist and bright Than dew-drop on the hyacinth; whose breast Was fairer than the moving lawn that veil'd it;— Did no such maid ever seduce Glen-Garnet? Gar. No!—never! never!—shame on this age, and thee, That set'st so light by female innocence! My youth was spent in arms:—For Scotland's right I've stood in many a well fought field; my hand Glued to the hilt with foemen's blood; my heart Faint, faint, and weary! I have seen my friends Fall thick; yet every groan that past we deem'd A pledge of freedom. O'er their mangled forms, And wading through a crimson tide, we've vow'd The vow to heaven,—to stand or fall with Scotland! Was that a time for pleasures? Have we bled For such as thee?—Fie! fie! Lord Badenoch! [Exit. Kil. I love to hear him scold. Bad. Old crusty fool! I'll gain that lady, brother: Give me joy; Did'st ever woman see so truly lovely? Kil. Yes; Annabel. Bad. No, no. Kil. Far, far outdoes her! Bad. Yes, as a taper's light the noon-day sun:— Kil. Give me leave To paint the two in fair and just comparison. Matilda's elegant, comely, and tall As is the poplar's stem; and her dark locks, Half curling o'er her eagle eye, appear Like ebon wreaths on polish'd ivory. Her dimpled cheek, like pale rose in the shade; Her lady hand, round arm, and long swan neck, So polished, pure, they almost seem transparent. But what a heart's within! How proudly cold; How dead to gratitude and virtuous love! If ever vanity appear'd on earth In form of woman, 'tis in your Matilda's. Would she not pawn her honour, nay, her soul, For admiration?—But, my Annabel! The simple, fair, and spotless Annabel! O, she outshines the morning!—The chaste snow That falls o'ernight, when neither smoke nor steam, No, not the smallest atom, is afloat To grime its breast, is not more pure than she. Go to thy lov'd Matilda, if thou wilt;— But list me, brother; when you sit at table, Do not as heretofore; sit not so close, The lady's hand in your's, whispering, smiling, Unheeding all things else, while her own lord Sits with a burning face and sullen brow, Talking he knows not what; and when she goes From table to her chamber, sit not thou Listening our talk, without hearing a word. And harkee, brother; go not out at dusk To watch a bower, or haunt the doors and windows. Or if you do, beware; some one may follow!— Pursue your course; but, pray, let prudence sway you. Say, does the Lady Crawford know our secret? Bad. She knows it all: But she is close; you may Rely on her. It could not hap else: She Was reared at court. I mark'd her rising beauty, And had resolv'd to win her to my will; But this great hectoring lord came in, and wed Her without dowery; doats on her to madness. But well I ween she cares as much for him As I do for the cloak that covers me: Her choice had been, rather to live my mistress Than Crawford's spouse. Kil. Thy mistress! Truly I should like to know How many such thou hast.—Stay, sir; thou goest not Till thou hast given the number punctual: I'll copy thee. Bad. Let me see,—(counting his fingers slowly, pausing, and shaking his head.) Kil. Again go over them. What! only those? No more than seventeen? Right moderate! Bad. Hem! hem!—(Shaking his head.) Enter Sir Ronald, Garnet, Squires, and Pages. Elenor dressed as one of them. Ron. Master, we wait thy orders. Bad. To Crawford all, man, horse and hound; away! Kil. I'll first go see the lovely Annabel. Ron. No; not to-day, so please you, sir. Kil. To-day thou art not master—I will go. [Exit Bad. and attendants. (Kilmorack lays gently hold of Elenor's hand.) Stay, pretty boy; I want to speak with thee. Elen. Say on, my lord. Kil. Whose page art thou? Elen. Lord Badenoch's, sir. Kil. Lord Badenoch's!—Indeed! Thou art a pretty boy; dost sleep in's tent?— What?—No answer!—My page sleeps at my feet. Elen. What would you more, my lord? pray let me go. Kil. What is thy name? Elen. Allan, my lord. Kil. Allan—'tis a fair name; thou art a pretty boy. Elen. I must begone—what would you more, my lord? Kil. Only a kiss, that's all. Elen. A kiss? Oh me! (She struggles, disengages herself, and exit in confusion.) Kil. Mark you that, my lords? Ron. Ha! is it thus? [Exit. Garnet. We're in a hopeful way. [Exit. SCENE II. A poorly furnished Hall in an old Baronial Castle. Enter Sir John Drummond, leading Annabel. Drum. No, no, no, no. I tell thee, they're impostors; You must dismiss them. I have made inquiry, And no such knights exist. Anna. Their breeding speaks their rank—it cannot be That men so gallant! so polite! so— Drum. Hold, girl!—you are bewitch'd—you're mad; keep clear! The very air they breathe's infectious; The dew of heaven that falls round their pavillion Has something blasting in't.—The bane has reached thee; It settles round thy wareless heart, and soon Will make it bleed. Base valets! lacqueys! That mimic their superiors. If thus They haunt my child, I'll make foul work with them: The next that comes to flaunt and flourish here, I'll take him by the beard. Anna. Hush!—calm thee, father; you do wrong them much. Enter Kilmorack. Kil. Give thee good day, sir; Heaven bless thee, Annabel. Drum. Amen, say I. Kil. Amen, say you? Drum. I say, amen. Is it not well? And more I say,—Fair sir, what seek you here? Is that not Scottish? Dost thou not understand it? Kil. I came, sir knight, to ask if you would join The hunt to-day? Drum. You know I will not; a feint—come, come; go on. Kil. And— Drum. And— Kil. Pay my devotions to fair Annabel. Drum. Come hither, child—it seems thou'rt a divinity; Will't hear the poor man's prayer? Do, I beseech thee. Kneel, sir, I'll teach thee how to pray; for well I know thou'rt little used to't. Kil. That will I do with my whole heart and soul. (Kneeling at Annabel's feet.) Most lovely! most divine!— Drum. Nay, hold!—that's wrong.—I knew thou could'st not pray. Say after me, thus:— Fair Annabel,— Kil. Fair Annabel,— Drum. Thou art unsuspecting as open truth, Kil. Thou art unsuspecting as open truth, Drum. And innocent as the lamb that gambols on the lonely sward, Kil. And innocent as the lamb that gambols on the lonely sward, Drum. Even though the guileful fox, Kil. Even though the guileful fox, Drum. Lies watching to devour it; Kil. Lies watching to devour it; Drum. Therefore, sweet maid, if you would ward the eye, Kil. Therefore, sweet maid, if you would ward the eye, Drum. That blights thy bloom for ever;—would you save, Kil. That blights thy bloom for ever;—would you save, Drum. Thyself from shame, thy parent from distraction, (Kilmorack pauses, and looks at Drummond.) Spurn off this foul impostor from thy sight. Kil. (Starting up) Sir! Drum. Thou'st not half done yet;—down again, sir, down; I'll wring the truth from out thy guileful heart, Of schemes so rank, so fraught with injury, The very winds that kiss thy shameless cheek Shall flush the air with red. Kil. What bear'st thou on? Said'st thou the tinted winds should fly my cheek? Drum. Ay, tinted deep as blood, and bear the dye Far to yon orient, till the blush of heaven Crimson the morn. Kil. Or you are barely civil, Or I do wrong your meaning much, Sir John. Drum. You need not, sir; my words are heralds aye To my free thoughts.—Would every one's were so! I've been too downright for this fawning world. Thou too art honest, and wilt prove it now: Tell me, then, who, or what you are? Kil. That you knew well before—The Lord Kilmorack. Drum. You lie. Kil. In your own hall you stand; 'tis like you ween The place is sanctuary; but beware! Say but that word again, and all the shields— Drum. You lie, sir; you lie— (Kilmorack draws his sword half out, Drummond takes hold of his wrist, and prevents him.) Keep down thy sword, young man: 'tis good for nought; It cumbers thee; 'twill turn upon thyself, And never wound the breast of honesty. Look at this letter.— (Kilmorack looks at the letter for some time, and starts.) Kil. Give it no credit, sir; 'tis all imposture. Drum. It looks not like it.—Ah! how thou art caught! Come, sir, this work brooks not delay—'tis stale. There, go thy ways, my lord!—(Pushing him out.) What ails my Annabel? Anna. You have Abus'd the noble youth, and wrung my heart. You may repent it: For, if well I judge, He is not one to cope with. Drum. Peace, my lov'd Annabel; a father's eye Is more to trust than your's.—O, I would brave The Scottish throne, to save thy peace and honour.— Ha! who comes here?—another! Enter Coucy. Cou. Sir knight, in proud and liberal commendment Of such high worth and deep research as your's, I give you kindest greeting.—This fair lady Honour and manhood teach me to survey, As one to whom my sword and life's devoted. For such a peerless maiden I would sojourn O'er half the burning zone; then in a moment Pass to extremes, and split the winter storm Of polar seas, unsandall'd on the ice. Nay, more, I would even— (Drummond lays his hand upon Coucy's mouth.) Drum. One moment give me leave, till I inquire Of your commands—With me, or with my daughter? Cou. Both, courteous knight—my reverence is to you; To such unquestion'd lore I shall be proud To pay repeated homage.—For this maid,— The fair, the gentle, blooming Annabel,— O, purity of beauty! I could fold thee Thus, thus for ever, to— Anna. Most worthy, most refined, and courteous sir, Square your approaches by the standard line That civil modesty and right defines. Cou. Pardon, angelic maid; and I will kneel, For thou art all divine, and worship thee! Drum. That well becomes thee.—In approval, I Will lesson thee; I erst have done such things, And thou may'st profit by it. Thus proceed,— Fair maiden! Thou art beauteous as the rose Unblemished by the suns or winds of heaven, While yet the dew quakes on its virgin breast, As if afraid to soil it. Thou'rt so fair,— Say on. Cou. Thou'rt so fair,— Drum. So lovely to my eyes, that I would give Cou. So lovely to my eyes, that I would give (With rapture.) Drum. My very soul, Cou. My very soul, (With rapture.) Drum. To ruin thee for ever. (Coucy pauses, and fixes his eyes on Drummond.) For I'm a fool, vain and unprincipled,— Why dost not say it? Cou. (Starting up) Sir, Such prayers I understand not. Drum. Seest thou that door? Good sir, 'tis like the air Of this fair morn may clear your understanding. Good morning, sir; make the experiment, (Pushing him out.) But let me see that hemlock face no more. Anna. That was well done, I blame thee not for it. Drum. Thou'rt playing with the asp, my Annabel; I charge thee, for my sake, avoid these men. I tremble for thee; and I must be rude To drive them hence.—Another yet!—Good heaven! The men are mad, incontinently mad; The point admits not argument. Enter Ronald, who salutes them respectfully at a distance. Ron. Your pardon, sir, for this untimely visit; 'Twas kindly meant to you, and your fair daughter. Drum. Sir Ronald, I respect you.—Would you hold That due regard at aught, come not to talk Of love to Annabel. My mind's made up: I'll know you first. Ron. I said I lov'd your daughter,— It is my pride. I love fair Annabel Dear as the soul that animates this frame; Not with that frantic passion of the blood, Lighted by novelty and fierce desire, Which calm reflection deadens, and the bourn Of hope when gain'd, extinguishes for ever. With no such flame do I love Annabel; But with a sweet and cherishing esteem, Which beauty, innocence, and simple truth Have shed upon my soul, like dew on flowers, Or like the first beam of the blessed sun, Which, after lowering storm, lights on the world. Drum. Sir Ronald, thou'rt a man which honour fits; 'Tis thron'd upon thy brow, beams in thine eye, And flows in genial current from thy tongue. Ron. And never will I favour ask of her Which you approve not. Never will I use Concealment, falsehood, or deception; Nor slightest witchery of guileful love. Drum. Would God I knew that you were nobly born. Ron. Noble I am, knighted by Majesty; But Scotland holds no poorer knight than I. Drum. Alas! look round you. Ron. All I see is well: Not rich, indeed; but then 'tis all your own. It is not so with me:—My halls are gay; The stag bells in my forest, and the flocks, Like thousand specks of snow, rest on my hills; But nought of all's my own. Drum. Indebted! Then I pity you. I've been so too: 'Tis a bad case; my daughter must eschew it. Ron. We'll speak of that anon. With your good leave She shall not.—To my errand. I have heard A plot amongst my friends, for which I blush. Fair Annabel, I warn you to beware; It points at you, dear maid; your all's at stake: Your peace, your beauty, honour, every thing. Anna. And you're not in the plot, Sir Ronald? Drum. My life for't, he is not. Anna. Whence grows his knowledge then? Is't likely that a rival should be trusted? No; 'tis the counsel of some selfish motive: I'll not believe it. Ron. Thou hast judged hardly of me, Annabel: Come near, I'll tell a simple tale to thee. Once on a lovely day—it was in spring, I rested on the height of that dread cliff That overlooks old Stirling. All was gay; The birds sung sweet; the trees put forth their leaves, So pale, that in the sun they look'd like blossoms: The wild thyme and the violet deck'd the sward On which I lay, scenting the air with sweets. Some children wandered careless on the hill, Selecting early flowers. My heart rejoic'd, For all was glad around me. One sweet maid Came tripping near, eyeing, with gladsome smile, Each little flower that bloom'd upon the hill; Nimbly she pick'd them, minding me of swan That feeds upon the waste. I blest the girl! She was not maid, nor child; but of that age 'Twixt both, when purity of frame and soul Awaken dreams of beauty born in heaven. Deep in a little den, within the cliff, A floweret caught her eye—it was a primrose Fair flaunting in the sun. With eager haste, Heedless of risk, she clamber'd down the steep, Pluck'd the wish'd flower—and sigh'd; for when she saw The depth she had descended, then she woke To sense of danger. All her flowers she dropt, And tried to gain the height; but tried in vain!— I hasted to her rescue; but, alas! I came too late! Anna. O God! and did she fall? Ron. Yes, Lady; far, far, down on rocks below, Her lovely slender form was found at rest! I saw her, middle air, fall like a seraph From out the firmament. The rooks and daws, That fled their roost in thousands at the sight, Curtain'd her exit from my palsied eye And dizzy brain. O! never will that scene Part from my heart; whene'er I would be sad I think of it. Anna. O! it is piteous; past all endurance! Why did you tell it? Ron. Because, my Annabel, You mind me of that child. You walk the verge— Take care how you descend; it may prove hard To gain the height you left. Your danger's great— Greater than her's. Last night I dream'd of it: The scene was all renew'd to fancy's eye, With wo redoubled, all but this one item, That I thought you was she. Anna. Ah, you astonish me!—Now I remember— Father, I'll tell thee something when alone. Ron. I must be gone, my friends wait my return. Think better of me, Annabel: Your hand, sir. Drum. Good sport to you, Sir Ronald; you alone, Of all the rout, I long to see again. [Exit Ronald. He is a generous youth: nay, on my soul, I do think well of Ronald.—Had you aught To say, my Annabel? Anna. He talk'd of dreams—I had a dream last night, And such a one! something it must portend. Grant it may come to good!—Wilt' hear it, sir? Drum. Doubtless I will. Anna. I thought I lay upon a lowly bank, Hid from the world's wide eye: A fairy brook Sung its soft music to the wilderness; The tiny daisies bloom'd around my head With little snowy breasts and pinken fringe; And the wild heath-flower purpled all the hill. Amid that still untrodden scene I lay, And O my heart was glad!—Till by there came A—a—(Hesitating and blushing.) I cannot tell't; I'll tell it to my mother. Drum. Nay, tell it me; I have some faith in dreams. Anna. She has more skill than you—I'll tell it her. Drum. More skill than I!—'Tis an ungracious jest. I, who have spent so many long long nights Reading the stars, and pondering on the way How habitants of incontiguous worlds Are link'd together, and may hold communion. But here she comes: Now let us hear it out. Enter Lady Drummond. L. Drum. What coil you hold! Pray, what has been to do? I've heard the tramp of steeds, the bay of hounds, Strange voices, oaths, and all the gates and doors In thundering motion. Anna. Good mother, you have lost, By your long slumber, what you hold a treat,— Three wooers have been here this morn already. L. Drum. What! from the noble train that hunt the deer? Anna. Even they. And I've had such a dream last night! Will you interpret it to me, good mother? L. Drum. That can I well; but I must hear it first. Anna. I do not like to tell it to my father; Because,—(Whispers her mother.) L. Drum. Well! what of that? 'tis but a dream. Drum. Yes, what of any thing? I did not think You had one thought you could not tell to me. Anna. Nay, nay, my father. Drum. (Aside) I wish to hear her dream; it may discover More than she is aware of.—Your dream, my daughter? Anna. Well, mother, I was lying all alone, And very, very happy! Yea, so glad, I almost wept for joy, I knew not wherefore; Till up there came a man—(Blushing) Drum. Well, what of that? it was most natural. Anna. He rais'd me—held me in his arms; and gave me A most kind kiss. Drum. Sure, for such rudeness you were angry with him? Anna. O! angry!—y—y—No—no. I near had lied;—I was not angry. Drum. Well, well, 'twas but a dream—go on. (Aside) Not angry!—(To her) But it imports much in th'interpretation, Who was this man? Anna. It floats on my remembrance But half conceivable. Pray, cannot you Unwind the mystery without that item? Drum. Nay, we must have the man in our mind's eye, Or known by name or pointed definition. Anna. Perhaps it was not he; but sure 'twas like The young—(Pauses) Now I bethink me, it might not be he. Drum. Who, pray? Anna. The Lord Kilmorack. Drum. (Aside) Good heaven! 'tis as I fear'd; my daughter's lost! Anna. He chided me for lying in the wild, Pointed a lovely bower that seem'd aloft, Shining in all the beauties of the rainbow;— It charm'd my spirit with a new delight. He led me to it in a blissful trance; But when we reach'd the place—'tis strange indeed, 'Tis wondrous strange! no rainbow bower was there, But verging on a precipice I stood, To which I saw no base!—My lover seem'd, I know not what, a thing austere and rough, And strove to push me down, down, down, for ever. Drum. O dreadful! it is bad!—If it mean aught, 'Tis bad in the extreme! L. Drum. It is not evident: Dreams all are dark, and often contrary. Anna. Just at that moment there came one, whose face Was mild as summer sky, when on its breast All slumbering lie the moveless clouds of amber: He snatch'd me from my savage love, and bore Me to the wilderness, where I became A beauteous hind; and all the forest deer Came round to do me homage. Nay, my dream Went on to future ages; for I saw Our progeny extended in a line Farther than eye could reach; and still they grew In grandeur and in glory, till at last Their branchy curving horns hoop'd the wide world. Drum. One thing you miss'd: Who was the man that sav'd you? Anna. 'Twas like Sir Ronald. Drum. I'm glad of that. It is a wondrous vision! If in deep sleep, that temporary death, Congenial spirits, lingering nigh in love, With our free souls hold converse; then it seems Some great events hang on thy fortune, daughter, And dangers great as they.—'Tis a short ride, I'll to the cave of Merlin. If the sage Is not enwrapt in previous fit, he will Demonstrate all, by formal calculation, Easy as I can see the coming storm, The winds, or showers, by dyes that gild the morning. When strangers haunt our home, and spirits warn Our minds in slumber by accordant visions, Caution is prudence.—Come with me: I long To ponder o'er this dream; then visit Merlin. [Exit Lady and Annabel. O, I have journey'd thro' this little world Amid contending elements, and seen The right outfac'd, and ruthless, rank oppression Rise from obscurity.—Once and again I've seen the noxious weed upgrow the myrtle; And the wild bramble overtop the oak. My house is fallen! extinct!—I scarcely hold Semblage of knighthood!—All my sons are slain! I've had poor thanks. Intrigue is prevalent, The bane of courts, that turns fair loyalty, Truth, candour, to the door; while fawning knaves, With glib formality and specious guise, Hold all the sway, and merit pines indignant. There is an ancient oak stands on yon hill; I've seen it cap the forest: Now its boughs Are all lopt off, and its old fading trunk, Shrivell'd and gray with moss, stands bent, alone, Loud groaning to the blast!—One little sprout Alone remains, nurs'd in its scanty shade: 'Tis emblem of myself!—One slender stem Alone remains of all the goodly bush That round me grew! Should that too fall or fade, Farewell to every hope beneath high heaven. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —Court before a Castle. Enter Crawford. Cra. They go on rarely, in despite of me! What fool am I, thus to be brav'd, outfac'd In my own castle, by such foragers; By things like meteors hovering in a wild, To lure the poor inhabitants to ruin, Unknown their frame or substance? If I wist (As much I dread) Matilda knew their lineage,— O I would mince them all!—Thus to be bated By hildings, leechers, nobles of a day! Ah! were that all, 'twere nought! But she I love Dearer than life;—dearer than this wrung heart Can ever feel for aught in earth or heaven— There is a thrust indeed! a killing one! Her hand she freely gave;—mayhap that was Because our good late king so willed it. Gave she her heart? Of that I've had small test! But ne'er till now ween'd I that heart was false. Heaven grant I prove deceiv'd; but 'tis as plain, As proof-abiding that there is connivance, As shines the day. Nay, I have heard them hint Of things long past which both of them knew well. It is so!—Is't indeed? Then what am I? Yes;—How rank I in being's kalendar? Low, low indeed!—The veriest downfallen fiend That preys on anguish, and delights to gnaw The immaterial vitals of the soul, Need not malign my state:—I'll do a deed Shall make the guileful heart of woman quake In future ages;—ay, when not a bone Nor fragment of a scull remains of him That did it,—when the whole of this proud frame Heaves in a molehill!—(Pause) Peace, my heart!—They come. Enter from the Castle, Matilda, Lords, Pages, &amp;c. with bows and arrows. Bad. You're ready first, my lord.—O, you shall see How I'll outdo you with the shaft and bow. Cra. You will! Bad. List, nobles all. 'Tis known, that I, As master-archer, sit your king forthwith Till one outdoes me. Then, good sirs, attend: The tinckell's up from Ganna to Glen-Ocher; Watch we the roads of Daur; and should the deer, By greyhounds bated, or by beagles bayed, To different districts run, we all may part. Well, then, let each man dine as best he may, By chrystal spring or on his saddle-bow; At night we sup here with my Lord of Crawford. Cra. Nay, pardon me, sir king, I do not chuse Thus to be bachannall'd and dinn'd o'nights. Your late wakes and loud catches do not suit With my slow-motion'd soul: My dame and I Would rather be alone.—Pardon, good lords. Mat. That's a fair jest: 'Tis well we know my lord. Trust me, he would not lack your company To-night, for all the deer that range Glen-Ocher. Come all, and welcome, and your cheer shall be The best this wild affords. My lord, you'll come? Bad. Doubtless I will, when you desire it. [Exit all but Matilda and Badenoch. Crawford lingers at the side scene. Mat. I would not lose the news of this day's hunt; I would not miss you at my side to-night, For aught I think of;—I had almost said, (Loud) Not for my lord himself. Cra. (Aside) Shall Crawford bear this? No; by yon heaven, We shall not all sup here to-night! [Exit. Mat. My lord, didst ever see so rude a churl? O, my cheek burns with shame. Bad. He's jealous of us to extremity: See how he looks behind him. Mat. O, I rejoice in't.—Closer yet, my lord, Come closer still; nay, kiss me if you will: O! I will teaze him till his heart-strings crack. Jealous of me!—I'll teach him to beware. Bred in a court as I was, I wont be Domesticated like a jack by him! Bad. Charming Matilda, how I love to see This spirit in you! Let me clasp thee thus! Mat. Nay, now my Lord is gone 'tis not so sweet. Calm thee; but list,—Pray keep his archery down; Claim every hit—outface him—swear you did it. If he sit king to-night our sport is spilt. Bad. Fear not, I'll manage him. Mat. But say, my lord, have you no page nor groom, To bear your bow and quiver? Bad. I had a pretty little wayward boy, But he is missing.—I'm not sorry for't, For reasons known between us. Mat. (Calls) William, I say. Enter Boy. Go tend that gentleman to-day. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. —A Glen of the Forest. Enter Elenor. Elen. Does this world hold a human thing so wretched, So truly low, as poor devoted Elen? I marvel much how man can thus give up To everlasting shame, to woe and want, The heart that loves him. Most abandoned wretch! Ruthless destroyer! how thou hast betrayed me! I've found thee out too late, when all is lost. O! I was happy in my father's home As heart could wish, or innocence could be! Oft by his side I've kneeled, with heart devout, And heard him pray to God for his poor Elen;— Yet I could break that tender parent's heart, Leave him, and yield myself a slave to shame! Slave to a fawning, cold, deceitful villain! I gave him all:—Now I am spurned, despised, My sex discovered, all my shame exposed! O, I am rightly served! and yet my heart Still clings to my destroyer.—'Tis a curse Imposed on woman, guerdon of her guilt, And scourge for inborn modesty infringed. Now I'm without a home in this wide world, Or friend on earth:—O! might I hope, that still I had one yonder! (Looking up) I would lay my head In the cold grave in peace.—(Weeps) Where shall I hide me? Enter Shepherd. Shep. Give you good-day, sweet master; you, I guess, Are a shrewd hunter; sure you may not trow That deer are lurking here. What aileth thee? Thou art not crying, sure? Elen. No, shepherd. Shep. No, shepherd. (Aside, imitating her voice.) How well a lie becomes Some people's mouths! I am very sorry for you, master: Can I be Of any service to you? Elen. No, indeed, you cannot. Shep. What has befallen you, sir? Are you unwell? Or have you done offence for which you grieve? I fear some one has used you very ill. Elen. I have indeed been used most vilely, shepherd; But I may not tell all. Shep. More shame to him that did it. You do not look like one would do much harm; I fear you are right far, too, from your friends. Elen. I have no friends on earth. Shep. Yes, but you have.—Hast thou no home? No parent? Elen. I had both, but I have lost them. Shep. Well, I have both, thank heaven; and they shall be Parents to both of us; and my home thine, Until you find a better.—Come, you shall Be very welcome. Elen. Kind shepherd, I will trust thy honest heart, For thou seemest good:—I am a woman. Shep. A woman! Elen. Yes,—a lady born. Shep. A lady!—I beg your pardon, Madam:—(Pulls off his bonnet, and sets his foot on it.) —Then you will not go to our house? Elen. Ah, shepherd, if you knew me you would fly Far from me: I have broke a parent's heart. Shep. Nay, that was bad; you should not have done that.— Ah, wherefore did you so? Elen. My inexperienced heart, In hour of blindfold levity, was snared By fatal, fatal love. Fondly it trowed The sacred oaths that gilded o'er the toil; But when the fluttering, panting captive lay Coiled in the net, and looked to these for aid, They lessened to her view, and at the last Were given remorseless to the winds of heaven. Shep. It seems your lover has betrayed you then? Elen. I left my father, in concealment lived, Still trusting my false love, in honour bound To make me his; till late he urg'd his suit, (Shameful device!) that I in this disguise Should to these mountains bear him company. Zealous to please, and weary of confinement, I came; and now he spurns at me, derides me, And holds me up to scorn.—Another love, More lawless still, his whole affection sways, And I must hide my wretched head forever. Shep. You have a father: He will not disclaim His poor repentant child. Elen. I would not look my father in the face, Disgraced as I am now, not for this world. Shep. (Heaving his staff in the attitude of striking.) Lady, do you see this? I'll ware it on The man who thus has wronged you; I will bast him Until I leave him scarce the power to cry, Hold, ruffian, hold!—I care not for his sword; I'll smash it all to pieces, thus!—O how I'll knab him! Come home with me, sweet stranger, you shall be Most kindly welcomed. [Exeunt. SCENE III. —Another part of the Forest. A Deer lying, with an arrow stuck in its side. Enter Badenoch and Crawford, from opposite sides. Cra. Thy boasted skill has lagged behind to-day: Brag of thy archery now; thou wert more near Than I was by a third. Bad. Well, what of that? I slew the deer. Cra. You! You slew the deer! Bad. Certes I did, my lord: I slew the deer; And will maintain it.—Who is't says I did not? Cra. Such insolence was never paralleled!— Well, to confute thee, view the shaft; its length Will prove it mine. (Badenoch pulls out the arrow, and breaks it in pieces.) Bad. The shaft is mine, 'tis plain; and shall not be Bone of contention 'twixt us. (Waving his sword) I'll maintain My word 'gainst any he that dares deny it. Cra. Presumptuous, paltry thing! art thou aware Whom thus thou beardest! O, were thy shallow might But worthy of my sword, how I would blast And mildew thy rank flesh!—(They fight.) Bad. My lord, I say; my lord! (Crawford gains upon him, driving him round the stage.) Hold, my good lord!—My lord, I say! Cra. Nay, keep thy fence; trust me, thou scap'st not thus. Enter Garnet, who rushes between them, striking up their swords. Gar. Damnation on thy frenzy!—Madmen! fools! Why this infuriate strife?—Hold off, I say. Cra. Stand back, Glen-Garnet; thou shalt witness be How I will gall this braggart. Gar. Knowest thou, sir, whom thou gallest? Or knowest thou me? Cra. No, faith, I do not; yet thee I honour, Garnet, And often think, that I have elsewhere seen That warrior form, by other name or title. Gar. Yes, thou hast seen me, where— (Badenoch stops him.) Bad. Hold, on thy life!—Thy honour, every pledge That manhood claims, front thee in stern array, And beckon thee to silence.—Sooth, my lord, 'Twas but a jest; a banter: Nought I meant Of insult or of strife.—The shaft was yours:— I'll claim it still; swear it was mine; outface you; You shall not gain the honour of that hit, Do as you will. Have with you for the next. [Exeunt Bad. and Garnet. Cra. So! I am balked again, and my revenge Turned on me for a foil!—That surkle lord Will learn to know his betters: he had nigh Paid dearly for his jest.—My mind is weary Forming conjectures who these strangers are. By what dropt from Glen-Garnet, it is plain That they are men of note. Then, too, 'tis plain, Their motions point to ill—else why disguised? I'll to the cave of Merlin: He'll unfold, In riddles and in rhymes, each guest's degree, And all th'events that on their purpose hang. SCENE IV. —Another part of the Forest. Enter March, musing. Mar. If these sleek menials may be believed, Who waste and riot in yon gaudy tents, Then I am sore misled, and this gay band Are not the men I seek.—I'll not believe't: Plain circumstance and reason both agree In pointing their retreat. I will not hence Till I have seen them face to face, and heard Each yeoman's voice. Not all their borrowed locks, Strange guise, and uncouth titles, shall avail; Nay, though they mask them in the scarf of hell, Some of them I shall note.—And should I find, As sore I dread, my fair ungrateful Elen Disgraced and soiled;—my beauteous virgin rose Torn from its parent stem, just in the bud, Ere yet its glowing breast had dared to ope Its blushing beauties to the summer's eye, Cropt by a villain's hand, and cast aside All sullied in the dust;—O, I will pawn This heart's blood for revenge!—Cold though it be, A parent's feelings warm it, till each drop, Each creeping rill that sheds its living tinge Through this dejected frame, thrills at the thought, And rouses me to action.—Yonder comes A homely swain; mayhap he can inform More of these stranger knights. I'll go and task him. [Exit. SCENE V. —Another part of the Glen. Enter Shepherd. Shep. O my heart's heavy for that beauteous dame! Her case is most unmeet!—All hopeless here; Lost in the very outset of her journey, Ere she had learned to note the onward path From those that lead aside, the shift of winds, The false declivities, the crossing cairns, That overpeer the distant weather-gleam, And all the marks experienced travellers know. Is't not unmeet, that one should thus be marred, Storm-staid in life, ere yet the summer months Are well begun?—It is.—We are unjust; Man's most unjust; and I will prove it on him From every law of nature.—In his progress Man loses oft his path; alas, how oft! But then he may regain it;—he's at freedom, Nor one gainsays.—But lovely, tender woman, Making one step aside; but one false step! Is jostled off for ever.—O, 'tis unjust! Man first decoys her easy heart astray, And then laughs at the helpless wanderer!— Those little flowers along the forest sward, And all those blossoms nodding on the trees, Will soon fall down dishonoured in the dust; Yet these the year will timeously renew. But once the flower of all the world is cropped, Where lives the principle that can renew it? There is no southland breeze can ever blow Again to bid the blemished stem revive; Nor shower, that rainbow beckons from the west, Fall on its opening blossom evermore!—(Weeps) But there's another world to sojourn in, Where lovely woman will not thus be treated! (Enraged) O, what a heart that high-born lord must have! I count him fiend whom honour does not bind; He has less feeling than the savage hind That roams the desart, thus to treat such beauty! (Piteously) When she had given him all that she could give, Trusted his honour with her fame and heart, Her little all!—to make her serve him thus, Disguised as a page, run by his side, And wade the cold deep waters, while the lords That him consort, took each his real page Up him behind.—(Weeps—then enraged) O, I could find, here, so To maul that cruel knight, as not to leave Inch of his frame unskathed.—Yes, I will go, And face the injurious craven this same night. How my brain maddens at him!—By yon heaven! I will so wrong him, his repentance shall Grow to a parallel with his misdeeds: I'll strike his sword to pieces, thus;— (Strikes furiously in the air.) Enter March. And then I'll fly at him, and seize him thus!—(Seizes March.) Mar. Madman, forbear!—Unhand me, maniac. (They part suddenly, and look long at each other.) Shep. I fear I have committed grievous error. Sir, I was raving, and I crave forgiveness: Frenzied with rage, my reason, for a moment, Was overcome.—It was not rage at you, But at those hunters:—Pardon me, good knight. Mar. So, then, you are not mad? Shep. Sometimes a little; when I think of those Who feel but for themselves, it maddens me; But I grow well anon.—I'm not quite safe As yet, for I bethink me of some hunters, That have done deeds of such vile character That nature blushes for them, and directs Each child of hers to shun, or chasten them; And I do shrewdly guess, that you are one Of that cursed gang. Mar. 'Tis absolute misprision. But say, good youth, what quarrel have you there? Shep. What quarrel, sir?—take care how you assay To blow the trembling spark; it lies on tinder. Are you not one of them?—Be sure; for if You are, I would not now be in your place, No, not for—(Puts himself in the attitude of striking March.) Mar. Have I not told you? let your eyes inquire; Hold consult with your memory, if I, In mien or habit, ought resemble them. Shep. You are not clothed in green, 'tis true, as they; But then you're some great man,—haply you seek them; If so, 'tis for no good.—What quarrel, said you? Mark me, sir knight, and give me serious answer. If you had flocks, and were those flocks your all, How would you list to see them driven astray, Maimed, scattered, and destroyed? Mar. Not well, I do confess. Shep. If you had a loved wife, to you more dear Than is your own existence, would you list To see her very virtues, by the power Of studied, deep deceit, turned to her bane, And point to paths of ill? To see her love Estranged from you, and her unweeting heart Lured into slumbers of depravity? Or say you had a daughter, knight, the child Of your breathed vows; one bred beside your knee, Who wont to sit thereon, and clasp your arm In her young bosom, climb your chair, and throw Her little arms around your neck, and kiss you! Nay, say that daughter were your only hope, The sole remaining comfort of your age,— You tremble! had you ever a daughter, sir? Mar. Yes, yes, O yes!—I had a daughter. Shep. Then you can judge.—But did you love that daughter? Mar. Love her?—O yes; he who perceives the heart Knows how I loved her.—(Aside) O eternal heaven, What bears he on? my soul's in agony. Shep. Could you endure to see that innocent Vilely betrayed, disgraced, and then thrown out Derisive on a cold injurious world? Could you bear this, sir?—For my part I cannot; No, and I will not bear it. I will go, And dare such things!—What, are you weeping too? Then you are good, and God will bless you for it. Mar. Shepherd, I do much long to meet those men. Shep. Then so do I.—Come, we'll go seek them straight. Mar. I fain would balk discovery.—If thou Wilt lend me thy attire, then will we go And meet them forthwith. Shep. Thou shalt have suit of mine.—Come home with me. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. —Inside of a Shepherd's Cot. Old Shepherd. Wife. Elenor dressed in clean russet attire. To them, enter March and Shepherd. Mar. Peace to this cot, and every honest heart That beats within it! Heaven's peace be with you! Old Shep. The same to you, sir. Mar. An earnest curiosity impels me To view, unknown, this jovial hunter train That live pavillion'd on the dark Badlewe, And chace the mountain deer. Meeting your son, He proffered me a suit of shepherd's weeds, Which I long much to prove. (Here March discovers Elenor, who sinks down, and leans to the side-scene.) Mar. O, everlasting shame! The blasting truth Bursts on my view, and all my hopes are past!— And thou, old dreg of sin! who could have judg'd Thou wert a pander? Old Shep. A pander? What is that, please you, sir? Mar. Hast thou not for a guilty poor reward, At peril of thy soul and heaven's curse, Lodged in thy cot this most unhappy girl, In fair convenience to a certain lord? O, thou old gangrene, thou shalt smart for this! Shep. What is't you say, sir? one such other word In the same style to that old man, who is My father, or to that young beauteous dame, Who lately here sought shelter, and I'll lay You flat as that same hearth you stand upon; Mark that. Mar. Tell me then calmly, where you found this minx, This shame of maidhood and nobility? Who brought her hither? Shep. 'Twas I, sir; how doth that concern your pride? Mar. Calmly, I say; where did you find her? Shep. I found her in the wild, fled from the scorn Of cold indifference, from guilt and shame; Nursing the rill with salt repentant tears, And sighing woes unto the passing winds, Till the old birch that waved above her head Seemed weeping too. Mar. Then I am sore to blame. Repentant, said you? There was a tone in that soft term, that seemed To sound in unison with every chord That vibrates round this fond corroded heart. (He pauses, and looks at her affectionately. She lifts her eyes fearfully, and withdraws them.) Wilt thou not speak, my lost lamented Elen? Look but that look again, and say, “My father!” And this fond heart that yearns o'er thee will melt. Omnes. Her father!—(She weeps.) Mar. Nay, this I cannot bear.—Come to my heart; For though thy stains were of the Ethiop's hue, Thou art my daughter still! These tears of thine Bespeak thy mind unseared.—(He embraces her.) Elen. O, my indulgent parent, do not! do not! Nor kiss me, nor embrace me: I'm a stain To thee and thine! This kindness wounds more deep Than would thy anger and most stern reproach. Shep. I am very glad to see you, sir; right glad That you are come. Do you remember, once I told you something of a wronged daughter? Mar. Yes, I remember; and I now perceive Thy virtuous kindness.—Blessing on thy head! Shep. You found me raving, sir; it was of Elen. Now you and I shall bring that lord to reason. Mar. Yes, I'll go with thee, shepherd: No disguise I now shall need; my way's perceptible: Where it may terminate is hid from view; But this I know, there is no other one. Tell o'er thy injuries, I yearn to hear them. (To Elenor) Shep. O spare her heart; I know them all, and will Recount them by the way. Suppose the worst; Muster up each abhorrent degradation That guilt may frame, or heart of fiend can hatch, And still you're far, far short of Elen's wrongs. Mar. If I find not redress, there is no rule In this bad world; and heaven smiles indignant At all the petty feuds and woes of man. Lead on, good shepherd. Elen. O best of parents, let me beg of thee;— Yes, on my knees I'll beg,—Go not to-day. What can thy suit avail—when all the floods That roll their chrystal torrents to the main, And fountains of the everlasting deep; Nay, all the blood of his licentious race, Can ne'er wash out my stain?—Stay till your rage Is calmed and softened into reason. Mar. Yes, I'll be calm as night; but it shall be The calmness of a winter evening, Which shifting winds may rouse into a tempest. Comfort thee, Elen: In a cause like this 'Tis vain to sue. [Exeunt Shepherd and March. Elen. O, my foreboding mind!— There was a time when heart could not have deemed That I was born a curse to all my race! [Exit. SCENE VII. —A Pass in the Forest among rocks. Enter March and Shepherd. Mar. Shepherd, 'tis wearing late, and nought appears. Shep. This way they're bound to pass;—No other path Leads from the forest to the halls of Crawford, Or to the tented hill.—They'll come anon. Mar. The sun looks pale to-night, grizly and broad, Blench'd and unsightly like a beamless globe.— What does it bode, good shepherd? Shep. God knows!—'Tis awful! Mar. Dost ever think of this life's end, young man; Or of the world to come? Shep. Certes and oft, my lord.—What is't you aim at? Mar. Think'st thou that many view that parting sun Who ne'er shall see him rise? Shep. Haply there may, my lord.—(Seriously) Mar. It is a weary world; a sad, sad world! A scene of woe, of wickedness, and death: We fume a while, then turn to nought again. Yes, shepherd, many a thought-set eye shall view Yon setting sun, that ere the morning dawn Shall sleep the sleep of death: And many a form, Now sensible and warm, ere then shall lie As senseless as that turf.—O, it is madness To rear such fair forms, to be food of passion And prey of worms at last!—If aught remains 'Tis an unbodied nameless thing, that flies On our last breath, and, mixing with the wind, Flits evermore along the voids of heaven. A dreaming ghost, a— Shep. O, sir, for heaven's sake, forbear, desist! Mar. What is it ails thee? Shep. Thou'st put my frame in motion; every inch Stirs like particular life.—O talk not, sir, Of ghosts in such a place as this!— Good God protect us! Mar. You are surely raving. Shep. Either I am, or else I heard a voice Boom from that rock, where foot of man ne'er trode. Hark, how it speaks again! Mar. By heaven I heard it!—This is wonderful! That the grey columned rock should ope its jaws, And blab in human phrase!—Look to the pass: It is some echo. Shep. They come, my lord; it is the hunter train, Whose clamorous glee has wak'd the slumbering sprites That harbour in the rock, from their day-dream, To mock and mimic them. Mar. Abide thou here unseen; I'll draw him from the throng, and question him With all address.—Watch thou; but come not nigh: Of family secrets we may chance to talk. [Exeunt severally. Scene changes. Enter March and Badenoch. Bad. I marvell'd much to meet you here, my lord; And started, thinking I had seen a spirit. I hope you're come to join us in the chase? Mar. Alas! my lord, I came on worse employ; Grievous to me, and to yourself I ween:— My only child, thy favourite, Elenor, Wo's me, is lost. Bad. Lost! did you say?—how?—when? Mar. Some five weeks past, while I was in the south, A villain came and stole her from my tower; And holds her in concealment, and dishonour. Bad. I'm sorry for't: But till the frame of woman, Her passions and her nature, all are changed, Such things will be.—You must not think of it. Mar. Not think of it!—My lord, you have not proved Such pure untainted love as mine for Elen. Her image was engraven in my frame, And ever present here: Whene'er I toiled, Rode at the ring, or fought In fields of blood, or foraged on the Tyne— 'Twas all for Elen.— Not think of it!— Yes, I will think of it, while the last gleam Of mind lightens this weary waning frame! And when 'tis out, my lips and tongue shall move To the old theme by rote!— Not think of it! Bad. Bootless to pine for that we cannot mend. She was to blame; I own she was to blame: So is the knight who hath transplaced her, Though haply not so much as may be construed. Mar. Think of the heart that could destroy my Elen, Infringe the laws of honour, and of trust, And rob us of our all.—Is not that man Most barbarous, and forever damned, my lord? Bad. (Aside) O pleasure, thou hast shafts abiding thee, That rankle in the heart, and give more pain Than thy most potent ecstacies delight! How shall I rid me of this injured parent? 'Tis not in nature to direct a task More trying or repugnant;—I must do it.— Be of good cheer;—your daughter may be found.— Good b'ye, my lord. Mar. (Stopping him) Found! did you say?—O gender not the hopes You cannot feed!—Know you aught of my Elen? Bad. No—nothing. Mar. Nor seen, nor heard, of one resembling her? Bad. None—that I think of. With your leave, my lord. Mar. Well; list, my lord—I saw her this same hour. Bad. (Aside) Then I am bayed indeed.— (To him) Where did you see her? Mar. Hard by. Bad. Then she's not lost. You best had take her home. Mar. Sir, speak'st thou thus to me? A parent's wrongs Must otherwise be answered. Bad. Am I to blame? She's a sweet playful maid, And given to frolic: hints and jibes were vain; She would not wait behind.—She's a good girl, But volatile and light as morning cloud, Or thistle-down, that dances in the sun: Could I give nayword to her blythsome mood, Of mating me a while?—I'm not to blame. Mar. Jesting apart, my lord—Art thou content To make the best compense that now remains, By honoured spousal? Bad. You'll pardon me, my lord; that cannot be. Wed Elen?—No, as yet you must not name it.— With your good leave, my lord, I must be gone. Mar. No; not yet.—(Seriously) Bad. What! darest thou bar my way, and bend such looks Upon thy betters?—Dost thou brave, old man? (Draws) Mar. Yes; and I'll brave an hundred such as thee, In such a cause.—Thou lost to honour, truth, And every feeling that ennobles man; O, thou shalt feel how this old arm can right An injured child! Bad. (Aside) Curse the old ruffian! I'll not trust his rage; My frame is all unnerv'd; I scarce can grasp The sword within my hand. I did not deem That guilt could so unman me.—Well, I see One of us two must die, else I must yield. I am a prince—the matter is decided— I must get rid of him:—Now for the means. Mar. Thou wretch! thou poltroon! dar'st thou not? Bad. (Smiling) I do not chuse to hurt my Elen's father: I did but jest, to move your honest pride; I mean to wed your daughter. Mar. O, I'm a fool; a headlong, rash old man; But I'm a father, and you must forgive me. My heart's so full I know not— (As he is sheathing his sword, Badenoch springs forward, and stabs him. He falls.) Bad. Take that, old dotard, for thy courtesy. Now blab thy own, and thy lewd minx's wrongs, And mar my honours if thou can'st.—(Stabs him again.) Mar. O wretch! O monster! Coward that thou art! 'Twas hard, thus to take short a poor old man; An injur'd man! Thy cup is full; and thou Shalt drink it to the lees.—My child! my child! My kind, heart-broken, helpless Elenor! O pity her! thou God of mercy pity her!—(Dies.) Enter Shepherd, running. Shep. O shame! O shame! O shame!—(Looking at the body) 'Tis o'er! 'tis o'er!— Wilt thou e'er show that dastard face again Among the sons of men?—I saw it all. Bad. Did'st thou? Then here's for thee. Shep. Hast thou a stomach for more blood? 'Tis well; There's more to do for thee. (They fight. The Shepherd strikes away his sword, knocks him down, and continues to lay on, till enter Hunters, Pages, Servants, &amp;c. with swords. He exchanges a few blows with them, and then flies, pursued by all the Servants.) Omnes. Pursue him! Cleave him to the ground! (They raise Badenoch.) Ron. How is it with thee, sir? Bad. Oh, I am bruised most wofully. Ron. How hap'd this bloody stern monomachy? Bad. That gusty earl, our house's latent foe, Beckoned me courteously aside to talk, Then drew on me forthwith, in furious guise. I warded all his blows, right loath to hurt A rash old man: But, driven to extremes, I gave the wound I rue, but could not shun. Just as I stood in tears for what I'd done, That ruffian came behind, and with a blow Stunned me outright. Ron. It grieves me much this lord's untimely death; Though stern, he was a warrior often tried. What quarrel put he on you? Bad. Nought distinct:— He talked of you, and wrongs, and dire revenge. Ron. 'Tis very strange he should be here Amidst this wilderness, in such a mood! It has been madness all. Re-enter part of the Servants. Have you secured the ruffian? Ser. Sooner you'll catch the wind, or the fleet deer; The swiftest steed that neighs within your stalls Could not o'erhie him on his native steep. He is some hind, a very devil incarnate: When one outstript the rest, he seemed to fail, Urging him on; then turned he round at once, Knocked that one down, and fled. Here come my mates O'erspent and maimed. Ron. He well deserves his life.—Look to the body, And let us on to Crawford. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. —Inside of the Shepherd's Cot. Enter Elenor, Shepherd's Wife, &amp;c. Elen. Have they not staid a weary, weary time? How far is it to Crawford? Shep. Wife. A good way, lady: More than half way gone They cannot be to Crawford. Elen. Where lies the pass they talked of, where they said The hunters needs must come? Shep. Wife. A short way hence, deep in the glen of Campdale; 'Tis scarce a mile. Enter Old Shepherd, who whispers his Wife apart. Elen. Do you not see, nor hear them coming, sir? Old Shep. They've not had time; they will be here anon. Be comforted, dear lady. Elen. The weight that hangs upon my heart to-night Is all unbrookable: Would it were broke! The dead have peace and rest! Have they not, shepherd? Old Shep. Yes, they have rest, peace to their souls, sweet lady. Elen. Their home is very still. Of all beyond 'Tis dangerous to conjecture: Mind is lost On shoreless tides, or wanders darkling on O'er vales immeasurable, till it shrinks Back to the blaze of time, giddy and blind. Yet they do sleep so sound, so peaceably, So calm, so unmolesting, side by side, No one to wrong them, and no sin to lure, That I have often thought they were most happy Whom the Eternal Wisdom chose to call, In early life, from this most wicked world. O yes, the dead are happy: I'll believe't With my whole heart. Yes, yes, the dead are happy! Old Shep. I joy to find thee in this holy frame, Thy mind resigned, and poised o'er worlds to come; For thou hast much to bear. My son's returned; But so o'ercome with grief, he'll not approach.— Thy father—is not with him. (Pause. Elen starts, and fixes her eyes.) Elen. O God!—My father! Old Shep. Thou hast no father, lady; he is slain In most foul wise, by that injurious lord. (Long pause. Elen shrinks, as if wounded, shudders, and stoops forward; then, after some convulsive shivering moans, faints in their arms. Scene closes.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —Hall in a Castle. Enter Matilda, and Hunters. Mat. Well are you met, my noble lords. This day Of healthful toil will cheer your hearts, and lend A triple relish to the social cup. Be boon and happy, all shall yet be well. Gar. The day's events are ominous, and warped By some inexplicable mystery.— One comely page is vanished from our troop; A gallant chieftain fallen in dark affray; Another rudely mauled; and, lo! a third, Our noble host, is missing!—Whereto tends it? Mat. My yeomen are dispatched to every hill, With sound of call and bugle, to give voice To every gale that wanders thro' the night:— The woods shall howl their larum to the rocks, The rocks cry to the desart: If the earl Still lives, he must by this time be discovered. Gar. (to Bad.) My lord, I hope you two met not again? Mat. Met! did you say? not otherwise, I ween, Than as friends meet: Not otherwise than friends, I trust, they met? Gar. Not otherwise than friends have often met;— But such damned tilting betwixt friends, I hold More semblative of savages than knights. Enter Servant. Ser. Madam, my master's steed is just come home, His saddle seemingly bestained with blood; Himself like furnace smoaking, covered o'er With clotted foam, snorting and trembling, As if escaped from mid an host of fiends. Bad. (Aside) Ah! then the earl is slain indeed; 'tis plain. I may as well take merit from a conquest Not hitherto by man achieved.—I'll do it. Mat. This bodes not well.—Nay, good, my lords, the while Dismiss your sadness; 'tis of no avail. Pass to the hall: The banquet chides your stay. [Exeunt all but Mat. and Bad. Thou wicked lord! I trow some one can give Accounts of Crawford: Thou art staunch and true After thy game! Bad. What would I not for thee, Beauteous Matilda! All the world is naught If thou art wanting with it.—Well I knew Of one great bar 'twixt us and tranquil bliss: Had he been friend, or brother, 'twas the same; I'm all for love!—I fastened insult on him, Claimed his first hit, swore it was mine, and proffered Decision by the sword. He drew on me: We fought; I drove him round the den, secure Of conquest; pressed him to the last, and oft Gave potent mark. It was all over with him: Had not Glen-Garnet, with officious haste, Rushed us between, farther he had not stirred. In pride he would not charge his death on me, But sullenly retired to die unseen.— Trust me, his gloom will mar our love no more. Mat. Thou hast wrought horror, and my soul recoils From thee and from thy love: Yet I admire Thy wondrous might!—What! Crawford, March, Both in one day! I did not ween there lived That man could match the arm of my lord Crawford. O, thou fell fiend! thou hast cut off a knight Whom, though I loved not, yet am bold to say, Scotland bears not his equal. Therefore list,— Hope not to thrive in my affection hence: Thou hast effaced thy image in my heart, And placed before mine eye a soul deformed, Bloated and stained with blood. All I concede Is, to keep silence till the event is proved. [Exeunt. Enter Kilmorack and Coucy. Kil. I called thee out, to trust thee with a plot I mean this night to execute. Thou knowest This morn how we were treated by old Drummond; Wilt thou lend me thy aid in bearing off His lovely daughter? Cou. There's my hand on't;—ought To teaze and mortify the old barbarian. Your plan? Disclose.—Hem.—Come. Kil. My page is gone, in woful guise, to say, My heart, unable to controul my love, And sunk before her father's stern displeasure, Hath moved me to abandon friends and sport, And hide me from her sight: That all I ask Is one kind last adieu—one short embrace, Before we part for ever: That I'll wait Where'er she shall appoint.—Her heart's so pure She weens each man's the same, and straight will come. The girl affects me:—we have sighed and toyed; And I have kissed her ruby lips, and talked Of flames, and darts, and most intolerant love:— I even think her simple heart will yield To go where I shall guide. Should she refuse, We bear her off by force. Cou. Well; some few flagons more of Crawford's wine, To front our confidence, and throw a mask O'er the forbidding features of remorse; Then hie we to fair Annabel. SCENE II. —The Hall in an old Castle, as in Act I. Enter Lady Drummond and Annabel. L. Drum. What moves thee, daughter? Thou art sad to-night, Absent, and thoughtful; and I note the tear Steal sometimes o'er thy cheek.—Art sick, my love? Anna. No, I am not sick; but— L. Drum. But sad.—In sober sadness, then, what is it ails thee? Anna. I think of my late dream. L. Drum. Pugh! a vagary.—Rather say, you think Of those your dream concerned. You are in love, child! Your dream shall soon be read as plain to you As Ave Maria, or meek homily. Your father, who, for sundry years agone, Has read the language of each little star That nightly rings the leaden dome of heaven; The humid moon, in all her varied moulds, The gilded crescent, and the full-set orb, Where frowns the giant sinner 'neath his burden, Have each to him a converse of their own. Now fondly would he deem himself a seer, And to the wizard Merlin's cave is past, To read with him the book of fate, and learn Thy fortune, and the fortunes of thy race. Anna. I dread he'll stay too late. L. Drum. He knows the links of Tallo; and will trace Each winding path in murkest hour of night. Anna. I have no heart nor power with thee to feign; It is not in my nature.—The young lord Kilmorack quits the chase for his own home, And begs of me one parting kiss, to mix His tears with mine, and say farewell forever. His page waits in the hall, and pleads full sore For gracious answer. Step I cannot move In this that's not conclusive; and on thee, My mother, I must lean for instant counsel. L. Drum. I knew thou wast in love, for I have marked The languor of thy look: But tell me, child, Is it the calm, the stately knight, Sir Ronald, That piece of virtuous cold formality; Or the untamed, impatient Lord Kilmorack, Sits imaged in your brain, and thereby holds O'er your young core this soft and pleasing sway? Resolve me this, and I can well advise; But, ere you speak, my word is for Kilmorack. Anna. My heart is more engaged than I approve To that young violent lord: I never yet Held slightest dalliance with him, but I felt As if I were in fault, and sore to blame. I have resolved to shun him. L. Drum. Note me, child:— Thou art a cold, ill-mannered, prudish girl. Remember thou art poor,—so is Sir Ronald, Even by his own report,—which like is true. When I was young like thee, O I know well Which should have been my choice! But take this hint,— Such wooers come not every day.—Go thou And say, that thou wilt meet him; send him ring, Or bracelet, as assurance. Go, I say; Maids should not, by constrained coyness, lose Those chances most they covet. Anna. Were it Sir Ronald, Although he moves me not so much, I would Meet him all dreadless: But I dare not trust My inexperienced heart with that young lord; He melts it at his will, and turns it so, I hold not self-possession. I'll not go;— These secret, stolen meetings, scarce become The blush of maidhood. Were my father here He would not sanction it; therefore I go not. What stays my father? it is not his wont To tarry out so late. I will walk forth The path to Tallo; haply I may meet him. [Exeunt. SCENE III. —A dark Landscape; Tower behind. Enter Kilmorack, Coucy, Attendants. Cou. Where do you mean to bear the girl, my lord? Kil. To the first lonely dwelling we can reach. Hast thou thy gown, thy breviary, and cowl? Cou. Yes; but I little wot how they'll become me. Kil. Short be thine office;—join our hands, look up, And speak in unknown words,—it nought avails What be the purport. O! without that potion, That stillient of the soul, which beauty drinks From churchman's hand, we chevaliers of love From many a fruitless foray might return!— She knows not we are here; but she denies All fixed appointment. Yet my page assures me That she is much perplexed:—Her father absent,— Her mother's tongue pouring forth advocation On my behalf.—From such a promised harvest What man would shrink? Cou. My heart misgives me much. If you affect the dame,—she's nobly born,— Why not wed her in mode ostensible? Kil. God bless the apothegm!—'tis the first breath That e'er was shaped to semblancy of virtue By Coucy's lips!—It is sheer envy, knight; I know thee well. Say, is it not more chivalrous To bear her off, which not inhibits wedlock, But often renders it more obligation? Without some travail and combustion In the attainment of delight, 'tis nought,— I would not have it. Ye propitious stars, I worship you! See who comes gliding here, Like the mild spirit of the twilight, sent To shed the odours and the dews of life On panting nature! O, ye suasive powers! That mould the heart of woman by mere sound, Hang on the evening winds, that every breath Which my rapt bosom drinks may be thine own, And flow in strains of wonderful conjurement!— Retire, good friends; and if my suit avail not, Which shall be fashioned to the very frame Of her kind motioned soul, then be you ready. Enter Annabel; Kilmorack steps from the side, and takes her hand. Anna. Ah! Kil. And art thou come indeed? may I believe it? Anna. Kilmorack!—My Lord Kilmorack here! Kil. Here, my sweet angel.—Blessings on thy head For this last kindness!—Here I should have stood Until the day-beam crested green Carleven, Ere I had quit my post. O let me kneel, For I'm unworthy of this holy trust! Anna. Trust! my good lord.—I no instruction had, By word or thought, that thou wast here; and much It doth amaze me. Kil. A resistless hand Still drags me here. Had I but seen thy form From yonder casement, I had weened my pains A thousand times o'erpaid, and should have sped From this beloved retreat more satisfied. Anna. I'm truly grieved that you are bound to leave The chace, the forest, and your friends so soon. Kil. 'Tis thy divine perfections, peerless maid;— The chace or forest has no charms for me Since I'm denied thy presence. I must go To my own home, and sigh for thee in silence. Anna. I could not ween your love for me was such; But you have said it, and it must be so. O stay, my lord! stay but a little while; My father may be won. Kil. Before to-morrow's sun hath tipt the cone Of yon high western hill with burning gold, Or flung the eastern shadows o'er the vale, I shall be gone far from these hills, and all My heart holds dear!—I cannot say the word, That cutting word, forever!—O, 'tis painful This last embrace! but yet that pain is sweet. I see you're moved;—One kiss, and then farewell! Think sometimes of me, Annabel. Anna. Farewell, my lord. Are you,—are you then gone? Kil. O, I could stay thus till the distant morn, The last that wakes o'er this devoted world;— Till the loud peal that waked my kindred dust, Should rouse me from my trance! But what avails? How proud would I have been, could I have borne A bride so peerless to my native vale! The envy of the land!—I'm most unworthy; But if thoul't go with me, sweet Annabel, No lady in our isle in state shall cap Kilmorack's bride. Anna. I have thought of it, my lord; I cannot go. Kil. I will not press it, beauteous Annabel; Thy prudence may judge fairer than my love. Give me a token—one small lock of hair; I'll case't in gold, and wear it next my heart, And press it to my lips each day I live. When the death-bell hath slowly tolled me home, And my last vesper been in requiem sung, My head upon that precious relic pillowed Will make my sleep more sweet. (She gives it him, much affected.) Adieu!—'twill break my heart longer to stay. Anna. But think'st thou their's are safe who stay behind? Kil. O, stay not then!—Your will's your own, and free As the dun deer that wanders on the waste, Or bird that cleaves the firmament: My heart Is solely yours. The thing most wished on earth By me, is to be one with Annabel. Should you leave all for me, kindred and friends, How doubly dear 'twould make thee! Anna. (Looking at the castle) My father and mother— Kil. Think not I urge it, gentle Annabel; 'Twould be too much to say, thou might'st confide In me, or trust my love and honour. Anna. O, I could trust thee with my life, my lord; And if there's any thing more dear to me, I could with that, methinks, now trust thee too: A love so generous has no selfish end!— I wonder at my heart: It is not right,— I know I should not go; and yet there is A little puny elf within, still whispering— “Go with thy lover, Annabel!” What does it mean? Kil. That thou'rt all innocence and purity, And must and shall be mine.—Come,—come! Anna. (Weeping and looking back) I know I'm doing wrong, and yet—Farewell!— (Stops short and starts) Hold, my good lord, a while; Let me deliberate calmly on this act: Short conference with my own heart will serve.— Fair candid maid,—Can'st thou, in time to come, Answer, with open truth and stedfast look, To prudence, virtue, parents, and the world, For this?—Not one:—No; not to one of them! Ah, what a gulf reflection has unveiled!— My lord, I would not thus, in secret guise, Go with thee to be made this island's queen; And, ere th'infection catches me again, I take my leave.—Adieu, my lord! Kil. Nay, stay;—I cannot, and I will not lose thee: Thou needs must go with me. Anna. No,—never; In this clandestine mode I never will.— I pledge my oath; therefore desist, my lord. Kil. Then since it must be so.—(Whistles; enter Coucy and attendants.) Anna. Ha! is it thus? Hold off your impious servile palms from me;— Here do I cling for safety!—My good lord, Since thus I'm in your power, I'll rather trust Your honour than my strength.—I go with you. (Weeps.—Exeunt. SCENE IV. —The cave of Merlin. The Sage is discovered asleep, dressed in a frock of sackcloth, and a white cap on his head; a large book lying open before him, with great red characters, and a dim lamp burning beside it. Enter Sir John Drummond. Drum. Hail to the central habitant who dwells In this dread, hallowed, subterranean home, Sacred to that which human power transcends!— Hail to thee, mighty Merlin!— What!—Asleep! And ope before him that mysterious book Which human eye hath never looked upon! I'll have one peep, though it should freeze my blood. (He goes to the book, looks at it, then starts, holds his head, and returns to the front of the stage.) Ah! what is this? methought one single glance Of these red characters beamed on my soul With such refulgence, its whole powers were dazzled; Its latent principles were waked anew, Expanded like the halo of the moon When wading from the dark and folding cloud, And nigh had melted from my frame forever!— (Pause) Say that I took that wondrous book a while; I should be wise as he,—haply much wiser! 'Tis a great prize!—I would not pilfer ought; But knowledge is a treasure that should charm All bars that circumscribe it into air. Say, that no other way remains but this, Which ever can reveal to mortal man The mysteries of that book—all argument Lags impotent!—Haply a week, a day, May well suffice to open stores of wisdom Yet sealed from man.—And such another chance Ne'er to recur again!—I'll take the book. (As Drummond retires with the book, thunder and lightning, and shades, like spirits, are seen gliding at the further end of the cave; and a voice is heard in a slow lamentable tone) Voice. Wo be to thee, man, that ever thou wast born! (Pause. Then groans and low tones of music are heard.) Voice. (As before) Awake!—awake!—O Merlin, awake! Thou son of a thousand years! (Groans and tones of music are again heard.) Enter Crawford. Cra. Heavens, what a dreadful coil! Hell has been here! I heard strange sounds; and lo! a horseman past, In mad and furious guise, away. The sage Is fast asleep.—Ho! Merlin, rouse thyself; The habitants of hell and earth are mixed In tournament. Arise, and make division! Mer. (Waking) Out on thee, knight! What seek'st thou here? Begone. I pity all thy follies, but to-night I hold no talk with thy preposterous race. I know thee; thou art slave unto a woman;— That thing made up of all the adverse grains Of jarring elements and steams of hell;— And thou art come to prate of her to me! I say, begone! Cra. Great prophet! I'm an injured man, and came To thee for insight and for counsel. Mer. Injured!—by whom? Cra. By some mysterious strangers; But chiefly by a woman, whom I love. Mer. Ay, by a woman;—Injured by a woman! I knew it.—It is very well with thee! The man who takes that scorpion to his bosom, Deserves the worst she can inflict.—Begone! Cra. I say I will not hence, till thou unfold The book of fate, and tell me all my doom. Merlin. (Looking, misses the book) Where is my book?—Wretch! hast thou touched that book? Cra. I touched it not; but ere I entered here I heard unearthly voices, and I saw A knight, with book in's arms, pass on so swift, That he outrode the whirlwind, and brought back The passing gale in's face. Adown the glen His furious courser dashed the pebbled path So fierce, it seemed to rain red fire around him, And spatter from the earth.—Your book is gone! Mer. Gone! saidst thou? Wo, then, to the hapless man; And woe to all that touch it!—Wo,—wo,—wo! Nature will soon be in a stayless uproar, And all the elements in roaring war. Oh! there are openings in that volume, knight, That mortal may not look upon and live! Cra. How, then, dost thou? Mer. Think'st thou the soul that animates this frame Is mortal; or came to this world with me? Ah, no! when first these mysteries I learned, That melted from its earthly tenement, And left this mould a moving, gaping corpse. Cra. O dreadful! dreadful! Mer. Seven days I lay or stalked in ghastly guise, Void of all sense, of feeling, or of mind;— My moveless visage held its ideot gaze, And my two eyes, like globes of burnished glass, Flung no reflected image inwardly; They would not wink even in the noon-day sun. Cra. How was this vacancy of mind supplied? Mer. The spirit, that now directs this faded form, Lived ere the sun or stars of heaven were lighted; Ere the broad world was in the centre fixed Of yon great frame that ever spins around it, Wheeled by the polar angels. She has journeyed O'er the unpaled and diamond floors of heaven; Has climbed the steep brows of the summer moon, To mark her influence on things below; Skimmed o'er her glossy seas, dreamed in her shades, Winged the blue void, and sung the hymns of God On yon green glimmering star. Cra. Sire, my heart quakes, and all my blood runs cold, Hearing thy words.—That awful book!— Mer. I'll tell thee, knight, Some pages in that book, if read by man Unused to guard with spell, will wake the dead! Yes, you shall see the new swollen corpses rise; Unbowelled forms in bloated winding sheets, And ribbed skeletons, shall join the array, With nerveless joints all clattering to the night! Even the dark aisle and churchyard ground shall stir, Heaving, like earthquake, with the struggling throes Of crumbling bones and congregated dust! (Moans, and tones of music are heard.) O God! the book is opened!—(Pause) One other page shall rend the firmament. (Loud thunder, with lightning.) The tumult spreads amain!—What shall be done? Where are my lingering spirits?—One leaf more, And he that looks shall fall a senseless mass; And yet that mass have motion! (Loud groans, and tones of music are heard.) 'Tis done! he'll look no more!—O hapless man!— Good knight, if thou hast pity in thy heart, Or sett'st at aught the miseries of men, Conduct me through this awful night, that I That relic may regain. Cra. With thee I fear not; For thou can'st quell the boisterous elements: But such a night by man was never braved! [Exeunt. SCENE V. —A dark Glen. Enter Crawford, leading Merlin. Mer. Where are we now? Cra. We are past the linns of Tallo, and descend Into the vale. Some habitation's nigh. Mer. See'st thou, (for my old eyes are dim,) where yon Dark cloud impends, and all these thunders jar? Cra. 'Tis not far hence. Mer. There let us bend our course: My book is there.—The sprites have done their work, Spite of the fiends and enemies of man. I'll tell thee, knight,—The great eternal Power That holds the balance of the universe, Is this dire night incensed; and sprites, that lie Chained in the burning stars, have dashed abroad, And with their bolts, blue-burning from the forge, Whiz, boom, and rattle through the foldy night. Cra. Will they not in that pitchy cloud descend, And hurl destruction o'er a palsied world? Mer. Nay, fear not thou,— Nature is roused, and musters proud obstruction; There's opposition in the very winds, And war along the burning firmament. I see the angels of the west approach In shining ranks, on golden chariots borne, So swift, that scarce the liquid element Bends 'neath th'array.—O, couldst thou see that sight! These are their arrows that you see so bright Gleam through the cloud and pierce the eastern heaven. O, for the book!—God! what a coil is here! (Lightning and thunder.) [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Discovers the inside of a Cottage; on one side, at the farther end, part of a Bed in a Recess. A Woman is seen kneeling, as in devotion.—She rises slowly, looks with horror to the Bed, and then to Heaven.—Coming forward. Wom. Confusion is abroad! The world's last day, The awful day that terminates our race, Draws on apace!—Now is the change begun! Had not the Eternal strengthened my weak heart, That heart had sunk beneath th'united horrors Of this dire night!—There lies my good old man: This moment well, the next a ghastly corse! And none but I, no living creature near me, To close his eyes, or lay his lifeless form. Here have we lived these many fleeting years: We knew we had to part—we talked of it— It came familiar, and we were resigned, And loved each other better.—But the time, And horror of the scene, what heart could brook! The wandering rack of the night-heaven wheeled back To one great vortex o'er my lonely cot; The thunders poured their moddering voices forth, Till the earth tottered, and the liquid flame Hissed fluttering o'er the floor!—All this I stood. Yet, desperately resolute as I was, Methinks my head grew crazed, and my mind wandered; For I remember, and the thought distracts,— 'Tis like a cold spear trembling in my breast,— Methinks I saw the corpse rise from the bed, And shake its head, and point with sightless gaze. (Looking at the bed with horror.) It cannot be! my senses are benumbed! But O, that book! that awful book!—It was No mortal man who left it in such horror. (Her eye turns to the bed; she starts, stands fixed in terror for some time, then slowly lifts her eyes to heaven.) O everlasting Father, what is this? Is nature all reversed? And shall the dead Thus rise and motion for their soul's return?— I will be calm—what's life or death to me? 'Tis nature's last convulsion! (She kneels. Thunder and lightning. She appears for some time in silent devotion, with her hands and eyes turned towards heaven.—A loud knock at the door.) If you are beings of this world, approach,— Uplift the latch, and enter;—All is one! Or be you summoning angels, you are welcome; Come in! come in!—All's one! All's one! Enter Merlin, followed by Crawford. No, no!—No human being walks to-night! Whence art thou, grizly form?—Deliver straight Thy dread commission; I am ready. Mer. My name is Merlin—this a friendly knight: Be not alarmed. Wom. Art thou the old mysterious sage, who dwell'st Deep caverned in the wild, and walk'st the night, To read the heavens, hold converse with the stars, And to the dumb and bodiless creation Give earthly voice and semblancy of frame? I fear thee not!—All is confusion here. Mer. Woman, thy speech is born of agony; What so distracts thee? Wom. There my husband lies, Struck lifeless in a moment!—That's not all— Once and again that pallid form arose, Shook its grey locks, and wagged its head at me. Mer. O hapless, hapless man!—Saw you a book? Wom. Yes; sure I did:—know'st thou aught of that book? (As she mentions the book, they all start, and look at the bed with horror.) Mer. See this and tremble, knight.—In that same state Was I for days and nights.—Woman, bring me the book;— All shall be well. (As she brings the book, a dressed corpse is seen to stalk across the farther end of the stage; it goes off a few seconds, then returns to the bed. They seem terrified, and cling to Merlin.) Cra. Great sire, can that form live again? Mer. Ah, no!—not till the awful day of retribution. The human soul is from that body fled, Mixed with the pure celestial flame that burns In other worlds, fed by the vital sparks Which human beings nurse;—from that beatitude 'Tis now inseparable. Should other spirit, Commissioned, come to animate his frame, Unhappy he! I would not undergo That I have done, for empire of the earth. I've been estranged from this world where I dwell, Holding communion with another where I was not habitant, and with its dwellers, Of whom I was not one. Wom. Hast thou no charm, no power to lay the dead, And make cold dust lie still? Mer. Yes; would to heaven I could as easily Lay this old form to rest as I can his! (He takes a cross from under his frock, goes to the bed, and is heard repeating these words:) Cœli fulgentes domus nondum reclusæ sunt: quiesce,—dormi, donec te redemptor e tenebris experget. Peace to his soul!—Now he's at peace for ever. Good woman, say, how camest thou by that book? Wom. Just as the darkness fell, there came one in, A knight; he seemed with shuddering horror pale; No word he spake, but left the book and fled. The storm was on.—My husband oped the book, For he could read;—And aye the thunder roared— And aye he read and read. His looks were changed, And seemed unearthly;—nigher, nigher still The storm approached; but he regarded not, But read, and read; till with a cry that spoke Unbrookable amaze, backward he fell, And grasping with his hands, as if to hold Something that would not stay, that instant died. Mer. I'm much to blame! But nature must decay. Woman, the storm is past, and soon will come Thy inmates, and thy friends, now on their way; And thou shalt live to see a son arise, Montgomery named, that all these bounds shall rule. Knight, thou hast holpen me—Say what thou would'st; By help of this I'll read thy questions. Look not. (Crawford turns round; the woman retires to the side of the bed, and sits down in sorrow and fear; and Merlin bends over the book.) Now, art thou ready? ask. Cra. Is my Matilda false? Mer. (Laying his right hand on the book, and looking up.) O, thou great guardian of the book of fate, Give answer just! Is this knight's lady false?—(The book flies open of itself, and Merlin reads) “Pure and impure, both in kind; What boots the body without the mind? Blind fool! could not ye see, In the hive of the wasp ye sought for the bee; The scaithe to her, and the sting to thee.” (The book shuts with a loud clap; thunder.) Cra. 'Tis true! 'tis true! Mad is that man indeed, Who looks for virtue nourished in a court; And such a court as ours!— O, I have much to ask; but still my heart Hankers on that—How shall I be confirmed? Mer. How shall the knight full confirmation gain? Give answer, spirit, such as man may compass; For thou in power art perverse. (The book flies open, Merlin reads) “The friar he saw, and the friar he knew, He doffed the cowl, and the brand he drew, And the man in weeds the warrior slew; For a chief may be false though a dame be true.” Cra. I understand thee well,—'tis a good hint. Thanks, thou ingenious sprite.—Shall I o'ercome The traitor finally?—(Pause.) Mer. I dread th'event!—Ask him no more; he's sullen. Cra. Shall I o'ercome? Give answer, spirit. (The book opens, Merlin reads) “Thy foes are high, and danger near; But the ostrich shall perch on the horn of the deer, And the rampant horse shall quake for fear.” Cra. 'Tis my own crest! Earl Bute's and Carrick's too! I'll find all out by this. O Merlin, grant me this One question more! Mer. Tempt him no more, good earl; The book of fate is best unsealed to man. Cra. One and no more, I earnestly conjure thee. Mer. With reverence put thy question. Cra. Shall my house long remain, and rule in Crawford? (The book flies open, Merlin reads) “When three times threescore years have been, That neither a king, nor yet a queen, Has grass or corn in Scotland seen, Thy house shall be as it never had been.” Cra. 'Tis dark; but time may yet unriddle it. Farewell, old Merlin: I am well resolved How I shall act by thy familiar's words. Mer. Send the old friar of Bield to this good dame To watch with her the dead.—I must be gone To my dark home, and wait my change in wo. Voice. Merlin, that holy relic thou must yield To him that gave it: Nature must not be Again subjected to such dire confusion By thy neglect. Mer. Then I am blest indeed, And all my woes are past! Voice. Before thou yield'st that book, which all commands, Say, is there aught that we may work for thee? Mer. Yes; heave up all the gray mis-shapen rocks That garnish old Carleven;—bear them high As the thin cloud that settles o'er the wind, Then toss them thundering from the verge of heaven Into yon cavern, till its dew-webbed roof And adamantine piles are jammed in atoms, That mortal ne'er may know what it contains:— Then shall futurity, in dread repose, Lie undisturbed, till the slow foot of time Steal on it, and with heaven-enkindled lamp Uplight it by degrees. Voice. It shall be done. Mer. And when this frame is laid in sweet repose Where I have marked, in green Drumelzier vale, Which thou must do, for man may not behold The exit, or the lifeless eye of Merlin: When white and yellow flowrets o'er me bloom, Come thou on summer eve, and with thee bring Thy gleesome elves, that carol on the steep, And fays that love the wan light of the moon; Tread one slow solemn measure on the sward, And sing a requiem to the soul of Merlin. Voice. It shall be done. Prepare,—thy change is nigh. (Merlin closes the book, kisses it, and stands bent over.) Mer. Farewell, thou dreadful, sacred mystery! Thou art a charge too high for man to bear: Without thee I am nought. (The book is taken up to heaven in a flame of fire; voices are heard at a distance, crying “Farewell Merlin!”) Mer. Farewell!—Now it is o'er!—Come!—O, early, early come! (He retires to the farther end of the stage, stretches forth his hands in the attitude of supplication, and vanishes. Scene closes.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —The Hall, as before, in Drummond Castle. Enter Lady Drummond, and Sir John Drummond. L. Drum. What news, sir John? have you recovered her; Or learned aught of her route? Drum. No, nothing:—she is lost; our child is lost! L. Drum. That is strange, sir John. Drum. Each pass that leads from hence is searched in vain. No trace, no word of her!—I sorely dread, And tremble while I think of it, that she Is borne by spirits into fairy-land: For well I know, that spirits were abroad That awful night. L. Drum. What said old Merlin? Drum. Oh, name him not!—It makes my heart turn cold! I would not witness such another scene For all this world. L. Drum. What did you see? Drum. I saw, and felt malignant spirits' power: A light old book grew heavier than a rock; Low voices moaned within it; beings ran Vengeful around me. My good steed they scared A thousand times; drove him o'er steep, o'er crag, In lake, in fen. They tittered in my ears; And scattered burning sulphur in my path. I yielded up the prize;—a prize by which I might have moved the world; but not before All the wild spirits round the mundane sphere, That swim the cloud or pace the liquid air, Were in commotion. That rash deed of mine Hath given them power over my Annabel. Now all my hope in this vain world is lost; And I'll go mourning to the grave for her. Enter Sir Ronald, wounded, leading Annabel. Ron. There is your daughter, knight: I've rescued her, At peril of my life, and house's peace, From foul and woful infamy. Drum. (Embracing) My Annabel! have I recovered thee? And do I see thee good and pure as ever? Anna. Thou dost; but thank this brave and generous knight: To him I owe my all. O thou said'st truly:— I've been deceived, betrayed!—vilely betrayed! Hence ne'er let maiden trust to her own heart, Or to a woman's skill.—False! false!—all false! Man's the best judge of man. Drum. How happ'd all this, my daughter? Anna. I have been much to blame; but I have suffered: Yes, I have suffered much, since I was borne, Scarce half-consenting, from thy guardian tower. Warned by a page, this valiant knight pursued Our route, and found me in extremity. O, virtue has an awe with it!—They shrunk Before his blade, and yielded me to him, With scowling eyes and many a sullen curse. While I've been in his power, O he has used me With such kind love, such honour and respect, Even as thou would'st have done thyself, my father! Drum. O generous, good Sir Ronald! More we owe To thee than all our worth can e'er repay. Ron. Thou can'st repay me well.—There is one boon, And one alone, can save me from the scorn And rage of those I have offended. Drum. Then name it, and command it. Ron. The hand of Annabel in holy wedlock. Drum. O that afflicts me! Wilt thou not reveal Thy own true name and lineage? Ron. I'm bound by laws of knighthood for a time Not to reveal it.—Trust thou to my honour: Give me that maiden; thou shalt not repent it. Drum. Dost thou love him, my Annabel? Anna. I cannot answer you in that. Drum. Not love the man who saved you? Anna. If it was love I bore for Lord Kilmorack, I cherish it no more. But this brave knight I do respect as I do thee, my father; But that respect is mellowed by a ray Of soft esteem; 'tis sweeter far than love:— That love I felt, yet dreaded. Drum. And would you like to have him, to be his? Anna. (Agitated) Pray, not just now: Forbear to ask;— I would not be another's: But I plead A short reprieve; and if you should request me— Drum. Then take her, knight: I'll trust thy well-tried honour With that which I hold dearest under heaven. (Joining their hands.) Ron. This night a priest shall make us one by marriage, Then hie we all to Lithgow. I'll prepare My friends and sovereign to receive my fair As my true wedded spouse, which shall preclude All intervention or remonstrance. SCENE II. —A Grove near Crawford Castle. Enter Badenoch. Bad. I shall grow weary of this froward dame: Though fair her form as woman's form may be, She has no heart, no sympathy of feeling, In pleasure or in pain, beyond mere self. Self-love, sheer vanity, and self-indulgence! All things are made for her, and she for no one! Ah, how unlike poor Elen!—No reflections; They wont pass current here;—Away with them! Here's the old friar who came last night: I'll wreak Some vengeance on him, for I loathe a priest. How now, old greybeard? thou lookest wondrous wise: If I may be so free, what seek'st thou here? Enter Crawford, habited as an Old Friar, with gray hair, and a long white beard. Friar. I heard of Crawford's most mysterious loss: He was my friend, and my best benefactor; And I came here to shrive his lovely dame, And give her comfort. Bad. Shrive her sure thou mayest: 'Twill be a grateful task; a sweet, sweet task! But such a comforter, for such a dame, Is a shrewd fancy.—Think'st thou not that I May comfort her as well? Friar. Thy talk's unmeet. I know thee not, sir knight; but this I know, The dame is virtuous as she's beautiful; And no familiar converse e'er will hold With such a thing as thee. Bad. Yes; thou art wise, and knowest a woman's mind; Her temper, frame, and ruling energies! She has no violent passions; no desires Of change, new-lighted flame, or adulation! O, it becomes thee well to talk of women! Old licenser, I tell thee, when thou shrivest This lovely dame, I know thy frigid blood Has so much fire remaining, as will urge thee To press, of amorous sins a full narration. Then shalt thou learn what holy cheering comforts This dame hath taken of me. Friar. I've heard there were such men, who loved to boast Of favours from the sex they ne'er received; But till this instant I have deemed it false, A libel on our manhood:—'Tis so mean, And hath in't marks so diabolical! Bad. Say one had tasted of those precious favours; Nay, feasted to satiety;—were't best To add another crime by flat denial, Or tell the honest truth, and say he did it? Friar. Woman is fallible; but her kind heart Is feeling and repentant. He that can First take advantage of her yielding nature, And then expose it, is a wretch, a fiend! A woman's fame's her all; and he that blasts it Is chartered in damnation. Bad. What! thou growest warm, old dotard. Darest thou say That I'm a baffled boaster, and a liar? Friar. Would I were sure of heaven's eternal bliss As I am of thy falsehood: 'Tis sheer vanity, Or downright hellish spite for suit denied. Bad. Woman's denial I have not yet proved: 'Tis pity thou art blind, and canst not see The sexes as they are, and as become them. When falls the evening we shall meet to hold Our obsequies to love;—Pray come thou then, For I should like of all things thou wert nigh; 'Twill please thee much.—From that thick yew thou mayest See all, yet rest unseen. Will't please thee come? Friar. Thou art a wondrous man!—I'll not believe't That thou so soon couldst win her to thy love: Such matchless beauty and unstained regard. It is impossible! Thou'rt a mere braggart. Bad. Will't please thee come? Friar. Haply I may, to prove how false thou art. Bad. I see her coming, and I list not stay To hear her vague conceits; they're tiresome to me. Watch here a few hours hence: 'twill do thee good To witness bliss which thou hast ne'er enjoyed. [Exit Badenoch. Friar. God grant that such unrighteous bliss as thine May never qualm my soul! or such a chalice, As thou hast drunk, be lifted to my lips! Vice, cherished in thy youth, has onward grown, Till ripened to the grossest, last depravity. Nought thou enjoyest, save glorying in thy shame; Or, like the vengeful reprobates from heaven, Enticing others to partake thy guilt. Alas, 'tis all too true! Matilda's false! False as the foulest fiend!—Well, it is meet I should be certified; then my revenge Shall have free vent, and riot in their blood. Here comes that beauteous, most unhappy woman! Enter Matilda, musing. Mat. Should he return, my ruin is assured. I've gone too far to wish for his return: I would I had not, for it lessens me In my own estimation,—even the show Of love and secresy I have constrained To this abandoned prince.—O, that I could Find out th'unblemished truth, if my brave lord Was foully slain by him: O, how I shrink At such degrading thought!—Ha! the old friar! These holy men know much; and they are close In venial faults and family concerns. I'll talk with him.—Come hither, reverend father; Thou'st heard of my late loss. Friar. Yes, and it grieves me: Lord Crawford was my friend and great protector; But this brave stranger will protect your youth Till your own lord return. Mat. He'll ne'er return: Good friar, I am privately assured One gave him his death's wound: He'll ne'er return. Friar. One gave him his death wound! He'll ne'er return! How hap'd it then the body was not found?— I dread black treachery and deep deception. Tell me, sweet lady, is this lord respectful? Does he aspire unto your love and bed? For if he does, and be of equal rank, Trust me, he's a more proper man than Crawford. Mat. Yes, he does love—But, list to me, good friar, And note thy ignorance:—This gay gallant, In manly courage, generosity, Truth, sympathy, and singleness of heart; Yea, every virtue that ennobles man, Sinks farther under my late noble lord Than that rank weed beneath the sovereign oak. Friar. (Aside) Do I indeed hear this from my Matilda? I'll kiss the very dust on which she treads; She has been much abused. Mat. What moves thee, sire? Friar. My heart has wronged thee; and it moves me much To hear thee talk thus of my benefactor. Thou art abused—Lord Crawford is not slain, But gone on secret pilgrimage, and will Return to you anon. Mat. Return!—Ah, were it so—Nay, hold; If you repeat that word 'twill drive me mad! Friar. (Aside) How's this? O, patience, keep subordinate; The character I bear no passion brooks. Mat. But 'tis impossible: His own lips told me He gave him his death wound—He can't return: No, he can never return. Would I knew all! Friar. (Aside, much agitated) O, thou eternal Spirit, who pervadest The empire of existence, let me learn The adverse workings of this woman's breast! Mat. What meanest thou, reverend father; thou lookest wild, And mutterest to the winds? Friar. Lady, thou knowest I am thy servant, thy devoted slave; Tell me the secret workings of thy heart, And I'll assist thee, be there danger, death, Shame, and reproach of privilege in the office. Mat. (Musing) No; he can never return!—That's absolute. Friar. Might I presume to judge, I would suppose Thou hast already given thy hand and heart To this young stranger. Mat. I have given him more than— My heart to him, that once was Crawford's! No; I detest him! But he is no stranger. Friar. More!—mo—No stranger? you then knew him Before your spousals with the Lord of Crawford? Mat. Too well!—we grew together in the court, And loved in youth: He is of royal blood; The prince next to the crown.—Return! Gone on a pilgrimage!—Thou hast appalled My heart, old friar.—I'll go seek the prince, And ask him farther of it. [Exit Matilda. Friar. They loved in youth!—More!—She has given him more!— Than what?—Her speech is most ambiguous; And yet she loathes him!—'Tis a candid picture Of appetite depraved, and vice in cloyment. Who would have weened that beauteous angel form, So young in being, yet so old in crime? O woman, woman! if that vanity, And love of state, inherent in thy nature, Remain unaltered in the world to come, Then may malignant spirits, with the breath Of flattery, and vows that swell thy pride, Lure thee from out the bowers of paradise Into the abodes of wo!—Of royal blood! The prince next to the crown!—I might have known it By his effrontery and licentiousness. O shame! that those in stations dignified, Who stand as patterns to be copied forth By rank to rank succeeding, thus should stain The annals of our land, by open violence Of every precept that enlinks mankind, And marks the bounds of honour and of shame! Misrule, so palpable and so unvarnished, Make's one to doubt of heaven's supremacy, And wrangle with his Maker.—'Tis even said There are some lords, who, for the fattening smile Of royal favour, and the fees of office, Will deign to lay aside the galling helm Of honour from their brows; and they will feast, And smile, and fawn, and set the face to heaven. Perdition on such wretched parasites! When Crawford stoops to this, may his proud name Be blotted from the rolls of chivalry. Yes; I will read to them, if prince or peer Dares trifle with the honour of my house: Down with him to the pit— Enter the Shepherd with his plaid and staff, as formerly. He comes close to the Friar, who is stooping, and looks curiously into his face. Shep. What ails thee, sire?—Thou'rt in a grievous passion; Cursing and swearing too, which is unseemly, But chiefly in an old man and a priest. Friar. Pray, follow out the business thou'rt upon, And don't distract my meditations thus. Shep. Sire, no offence; I meant none, on my soul: But noting your wild passionate demeanour, I deemed it friendly to divert your thoughts To something more befitting your grey hairs, Your life of sufferance, and most mild vocation. Friar. What is your business here, young man? Shep. 'Tis well remembered.—I am come in search Of a poor damsel, whom mishap hath reft Of her true mind.—She had been raving much Of this same castle;—of its dame;—and one Who robbed her of her all.—Escaped o'er night, Her steps I this way traced, and she was seen Enter this glen. Have you observed her, sire? Friar. I saw a beauteous country maiden stand Upon the margin of yon rippling stream, In strange fantastic mood, most pitiable. Her fading cheek was on her shoulder leaned; Her lips just parted, and her full blue eyes Pointed inquisitive into the air, Where nought was to be seen: Yet she there saw Something by wild imagination framed; For still more fixed and curious grew her look, Till, by degrees, her hand stole from her breast, Where it was placed, as with intent to hold The trembling heart within its citadel, Moved imperceptibly into the air, Till it was pointed at the very aim On which her eye was bent.—Then all at once She pulled a flower, and steeped it in the brook; Washing her fair hands with such frantic haste As if the water of the stream were boiling. She's not far hence; we'll seek her conjunctly. [Exeunt. SCENE III. —Another part of the Glen. Enter Elenor in a fantastic russet dress, carrying some flowers; she looks ruefully upward, and motions as with intent of extinguishing a light. Elen. Will none take pity on me, and put out That little lamp, or turn it to one side? Wilt thou not do it? Were't in other point Than just the zenith, I could bear with it; But there it burns, and burns, and burns, And my poor head burns with it! Who hung it there, or how it comes suspended So close above my head, I cannot learn; But it torments me. Oh, sway it aside One little inch! That is a small request,— Yet none will do it!—Yes, I know thou wilt; For thou art kind,—kind,—kind,—kind!— Now,—now,—now,—now,—now;— Uh!—uh!—uh!—There it is off. Now I am well;—quite well!—O, what a weight Is from my heart! 'Tis light,—light! (Laughs feebly and franticly; it dwindles to a kind of crying: comes forward, and sits down in a feeble convulsion of laughter.) I cannot help laughing at the conceit of the poppy being a lord. It was so like! like!—(Laughs, and selects a daisy). It was in hard circumstances the little virgin flower, for it had no one to defend or protect it.—It said, no; and the tear was in its eye.—What could it do more, when it said no, no, to the last? And it wept too. (Weeps)—Then it laid down its head, and died! (Weeping and sobbing.) Enter Shepherd and Friar. Shep. Elen!—Why sit'st thou weeping here alone Over a faded flower? Elen. Dost thou not see How all the virgin gold within its bosom Is stolen away; and all the blushy hues That tinged its cheek? O, I must weep for it! Friar. Kind heaven restore her! She's a gentle dame. And is't all true that thou hast said of her? Seduced, maltreated, spurned away indignant For a new flame! Her father foully murdered! Shep. All by this upstart lord, who governs here. O sire, hast thou no influence with heaven, Whose justice stands arraigned by such misdeeds? Canst thou not bring the forked bolt adown; Or make the earth to ope her furnaced jaws, And gorge him to the centre? Friar. No; but I've power on earth that soon shall make His guilt fall triple on his dastard head. Enter Badenoch, who turns aside and speaks. Bad. A maiden all distract! and the bold hind Who saw old March's death!—If aught on earth Could mar my pleasures, it would be this event. It shall not!—Clown, who brought that creature here? I list not that such maniacs thus should haunt My private walks. Go, take her hence, I say. Shep. Dost thou not know this creature, sir? Bad. How should I know her? Lead her straightway hence, Else slaves shall drag you both into the dungeon. No reply—go off.— [Exit Badenoch. (Elenor views him with a vacant pitiable look; and when he retires, she plays franticly with her hands.) Shep. O, sire, let me come at him. Friar. No, hold, not yet; his cup of wickedness Wears to the brim apace, and he shall drink it. Shep. (Aside to the Friar) See, he returns: O, let me kill him now! I'll do it forthwith; he shall not escape me. Friar. Peace, peace, I say.—Wait the event;—be calm. Re-enter Badenoch. Bad. Who is this maiden, hind? is she thy sister? Some feature sought my heart so forcibly, Missing my recollection, that it drew me To read the trait once more. (Elenor turns round, and looks ruefully in his face.) O soul of agony! Has the eternal and avenging Spirit Another shaft like this?—No, no; 'tis past! I have outstepped the bounds of nature here, Wounding her finest cords, which all the balm Of worlds can never heal.—O God! O God! [Exit. Friar. Ay, thou mayest groan and howl. It is begun; The worm that gnaws the conscious soul has there Begun its work; but oh, when shall it end? Shep. (Weeping) I saw him weeping,—and—I—will not—kill him. No;—I have determined not to kill him; Nor any man—that—weeps—for any thing! Elen. Did he not say, that it would never heal? 'Tis false,—he would deceive me; for I dressed it: These hands have often bound my father's wounds, And they grew well anon. I had a brother, A beauteous brother, and they wounded him: But he lay down to rest, and there was blood Came streaming from that wound—he felt it warm As it crept down his breast; his eyes grew heavy; But he beheld the grass before he slept, And it was wet and growing, but not green.— 'Tis a—ll false—all false! Shep. Wilt thou go home with me, sweet Elenor? Elen. Yes, yes;—(As they are going out she shrinks back) Oh, there it is! there it is!—I can't go now. Put it out, good youth; put it out. Shep. What is it pains thee, gentle sufferer? Elen. Dost thou not see that little golden lamp That burns above my head, dazzling my brain? I cannot bear it!—O put it aside! Put it in any place but that. Friar. O, this is pitiful! It is a ray Of dire remembrance warring with distraction: That lamp that sears her brain is memory. Reason is veering on a verge, and soon Will gain the empire of her wounded breast, And she may live a holy penitent. Elen. Live—live!—No, that cannot be; For the poor babe has neither father nor mother— He cannot live: For if they carry him, the wind will blow in his face,—the sun will parch his lips, and the rain will fall down upon his head!—And his thin auburn locks will be all dripping, dripping wet! (She strikes slightly at her locks, and strains them, as with intent to put wet from them.) Shep. Wilt thou go home with me, sweet Elenor? Elen. Yes, yes;—come—come—come—come. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. —A Grove near Crawford Castle, as before. Enter Friar. Friar. Hold, my wrung heart, hold still thy wonted firmness! The only meed remains is in thy power: Vengeance is thine, and that alone becomes thee. Say she knew I were living, and in health;— 'Twas a bad deed!—What then?—She deems me slain: Does that aught palliate? is't not ten times worse Than were the other? Slain by that same hand Around her pressed in soft and wanton dalliance! The man she swore to love—took to her bosom!— Couched in his blood upon the neighbouring waste, While yet his wounds are green, hardly begun To fester and corrupt—and the red stream Scarce clotted in the sun!—His murderer, Pressed to her bosom, riots in her love:— Is this a palliation?—Soft! he comes. Enter Badenoch, gayly. Bad. Well, father, thou art satisfied, and wiser By one full half than thou wast heretofore. What sayest thou now? Friar. Hast thou no qualm of conscience, no remorse For acts like these? For to corrupt or slander Are heinous both alike. Bad. No, on my soul; not one. Friar. If Crawford should return, I ween thy head Stands in full danger. Bad. I hold light of Crawford: His boasted might already have I proved, And found it nothing worth.—Oh, I relent That I killed him so soon, so easily! Would he were here to-night, that I might shew thee I could as easily subdue his sword As the slim virtue of his facile dame. Foh on such champions!—Would that he were here! (The Friar flings off his cowl, wig, and beard, and stares him in the face.) Cra. Thy wish is granted. Bad. What! Crawford?—Didst thou never ween, my lord, I knew it all the while: The jest was neat. Cra. The honour of my consort and my name Effaced, is a neat jest—a well turned jest! Fair Elenor of March, my old friend's child, Ruined, debased, and driven to distraction! Her father stabbed in semblancy of friendship! Are these all jests with you, brave courtier? Bad. For all of these I'll answer; not to thee. But since I find thee in this querulous mood, This night I quit your towers, and yield you up My wardship, in regard, much as I found it. Cra. 'Tis vastly kind! I'm much beholden to you; And, in return, I beg you first accept The boon you lately prayed.—(Drawing) Here stands Lord Crawford: Thou hast a sword; now use it as becomes thee. Bad. Haply, my lord, when you the truth do learn This rashness thou mayest rue. Cra. I know thy cowardly and hellish nature: Thou wilt not fight; thou listest not such wrong! But when I sheathe my sword, or turn my back, Then wilt thou stab me as thou didst old March. But I'll not trust thee: Draw that sword of thine. (Advancing) Bad. Then to confound thy arrogance, dost know Whom thus thou threatest?—Dost know our Scottish king, Robert the third? Cra. And if I do? Bad. Then know His brother I,—Prince Alexander Stewart!— Now, trowest thou I am one who dare not fight thee? Kneel, and ask pardon for thy rank offence, Steaming in face of potent royalty; Or, by the blessed light, short is thy span Of temporal heritage! Cra. Wo to the land Where princes such as thee hold domination! Think'st thou the honours and the lives of men, Maidens, and dames, were only made for princes? Such precept stands not in my nature's creed. Bad. Few words are best: When thou the catechism Of thy belief hast finished, please betake thee To thy offence most potent. (They fight; Crawford gains upon him, and drives him off the stage: clashing of swords, and groans, behind the scenes.—As they depart, the Shepherd comes stealing on as in terror.) Shep. That's the most wonderful old man on earth! He is some angel in a friar's form! He mastered him as easily as I Would do a lamb.—I'm much deceived in this, If yon abandoned wretch do not receive A sharp requital of our detriment.— Lord! here he comes again! (The Shepherd strides hastily away, cowering as if in terror.) Enter Crawford, masked as before. Cra. So perish all who use their rank and power To purposes so shameless and unholy! I've stayed his course for ever:—And I did it Without remorse,—without uneasiness. But oh, the task awaiting me is dreadful! Enter Matilda. Mat. Saw you the prince, old friar? Cra. Yes, Matilda: I saw him lately in the bower with thee; And if my view belied thee not, I saw thee Lean on his breast; I saw him kiss thy lips, Embrace and fondle thee. Pray, was that meet? Does it become thy present plight, fair lady? Mat. What! in the bower?—Go;—say not so again. Cra. If thou hast neither shame nor sense of wrong, Hast thou no terrors of an injured husband, Should he again return? Mat. Should he again return, (which heaven direct), What then? I'll pack this prince about his ends; For I am weary of him, and despise him. Thou shalt absolve and housel me in secret; Then I shall well stand purely justified To my kind, honoured lord. Cra. No, thou never wilt! Mat. What?—Not persuade him I am innocent? Cra. No;—never;—never! Mat. I comprehend thee not. Cra. Then do it now. (Unmasks, and stares her in the face.) Mat. Lord Crawford!—Thou, my husband!—Oh! (Groans, then starts, and looks with dignity and disdain.) Cra. Matilda! Matilda!—(Pause) Come hither, I will show a sight to thee Will freeze thy pampered blood.— There lies thy paramour!—(Pause) Mat. And is it come to this! Well, what is next to do? Him I regret not, Nor fear I thee. Cra. But I will make thee fear me.— Poor, callous, lost Matilda! whom I took All dowerless from a loose ungracious court, Deeming thy youth and innocence exposed To countless snares.—Ah! little weened I then I took a courtly chamberer to my tower, An adder to my bosom.—(Pause)—What, not a word? Hast thou no grace, no single boon to ask? Mat. Not one of thee. Cra. Then kneel to heaven, proud dame, and ask forgiveness! For thou hast but a short, short time to live. Mat. With heaven I'm not conversant: I ne'er pray, Nor will I now in my extremity: I hate all whining. Cra. Most perverse, perverse woman! Mat. Spare reproach, And glut thy cruel purpose with my blood. Seeing, as I do now, thy jealous nature, Know, I detest thee, loathe thee; and should'st thou Now spare my life, I would right lieve pursue The same unaltered, unrestrained career. Nor have I in my life done single act Which I regret, or would not do again, Save wedding thee. Cra. Thou art a blot upon the cheek of nature; A stain upon thy sex!—Down all compunction! (He draws his sword.) Enter Shepherd, stealing as before. Shep. O, he must be a devil, and no man! Well, be he angel, devil, or a priest, Or all in one, I'll not stand cowering here, And see a woman slain. Cra. What! not one daunted look? thou bravest my rage As if I could not hurt thee.—Take thy guerdon! (As Crawford is bringing a stroke to slay her, the Shepherd runs up to him, and strikes the sword out of his hand, which he lifts.) Strike now, old ruffian!—Madam, haste thee, 'scape Into the castle; call up all your men, And bar the gates: I'll guard this ruthless priest Till you are safe. Pray struggle not, sir priest; In that I'll prove your equal. You shall not Regain this sword you would so much profane: It was not made to slaughter women thus. Cra. Rash youth! though good, thou art improvident: Thou'st marred an act of most consummate justice. Shep. Who! Crawford! is it thee? I bless my God Who made me instrument of this release. Thou nigh had'st done a deed that would have cost thee Remorse, eternal and irremiable! Did'st thou not mark her proud impenitence; And durst thou thrust incontinent to hell A precious living soul?—Could that be justice? Cra. Youth, thou hast roused reflection from its trance, And raised a doubt within me, which before I have not combated.—Pray thee, go on. Shep. Guilty or true, her death could not be justice. If she were guiltless, then the die was cast, And all remede and retribution over. If guilty, death seals up futurity, Debarring all repentance or amendment. Then where's the justice? He who makes one saint Does labour more congenial to his Maker, Than he who shrouds in death a thousand sinners. Put her in ward,—in solitary cell,— Her food be bread and water, till she think Free for herself, and then she'll think aright. O, my good lord! when thou stand'st at that bar Where all must stand,—think, will it best become thee To say, “In passion's heat I slew my spouse, “And plunged her soul in everlasting woe;”— Or to present a blessed penitent Thou rescued'st from destruction? Cra. Thou hast o'ercome me.—O, immortal truth! Still, still thou must prevail, though thy soft balm Drop from a peasant's mouth! Enter a Forester, running. For. My lord! my lord! That wounded stranger knight, with his last breath, Bade me haste to you, and declare, as he Should answer his account, that your fair dame Is most unblemished, pure.—He did belie her; It was not she was in the bower with him;— And howsoever her demeanor seems, She is most absolute and proudly chaste. Cra. How's this, low knave? Art thou suborned to this? For. These were his words, my lord; nor know I aught Whereto they tend. But he so earnestly Delivered them, while in the grasp of death, I judged this message meet. Cra. The burning flame That preyed upon my heart, begins to abate, And mellow to a soft and welcome glow Of love for my too proud, but wronged Matilda. Canst thou forgive me? Shep. Could'st thou ever deem That form majestic, that proud eagle-eye, That mien, so dignified in every line, Contained a soul could ever stoop to bathe In spring so tainted and impure?—No, no; The blame is all thine own. Cra. Matilda, thou hast faults;—nay, grievous faults, Born of a haughty and unyielding soul.— Yet, all those faults reviewed, I now behold thee As something above woman. Shepherd, thou Cam'st like the messenger of God, to save me From that I quake to think of. But if trust, The highest trust, riches and honours, may Avail thee aught, and chain thy long regard To me and mine, of these thou shalt not lack. The poor regretted Elen, too, we'll cherish, And thou shalt be her guardian still. Come with us. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —A Prison-Room. Enter Drummond and Annabel. Anna. Cheer thee, my father; all the ills we bear, Impatience and regret embitter to us. There is some wide mis-aim in our arrestment; Sir Ronald will return and own his spouse: If he prove false, there is no faith in man. Drum. 'Tis all a deep-laid scheme from first to last; I trace it in progression:—A base scheme To rob a harmless maiden of her honour! And now he weens that this severity Will drive us from the court, and cause forego All claims upon his person.—Said he not The hall he left you in was his? Anna. He said it was my own, and I might use it, And all within it, at my will and pleasure.— That the rash vow of knighthood, which obliged Him to conceal his name and dignity For such a term—that term was nigh expired, And he would then present his Annabel To all his friends, as his true wedded spouse. That many times that oath he had repented, Seeing the purposes at which it aimed; But took it in an hour of gayety, With kinsmen, and with friends, and would not break it. Drum. His friends have found that you are poor, my girl, And forced him by persuasion thus to shun you. My house hath long been tottering to its fall, And now that fall's complete. Anna. Cheer thee, my father; I am much assured All shall be well. He must be man of note, If yon proud towers were his. Drum. The steward of that house knew no such man; Nor by his borrowed name, nor by description: And, swearing I had come on base intent, Put me in ward, with many a churlish threat. I sent a messenger unto the king, With a full statement of our injuries:— He's noted for benevolence and justice, And I had hopes that he would stand our friend; But he regards us not, nor answers me. We are deserted, and most destitute; And of our cause I fear there is no hope. When poverty with greatness must contend, The chance is poor indeed! Enter Keeper. Keeper. A messenger from good King Robert greets you. Drum. Bid him approach.—(Enter Messenger.) Mess. Our sovereign lord, King Robert, sends to say, He doubts of all your strange romantic tale. Some knights, he knows, in youthful frolic, went Disguised into the forest; but that now They're all returned, save one, who stays in Crawford. He has given orders for a strict attendance By those, and all the nobles of his court:— If you, or she, can point the man who wronged you, The king will force him to perform his vows. If not, 'tis plain you are a bold impostor, And mean unvalued article to vend By stratagem and guile,—to fasten wrong Upon some nobleman of honoured name,— And both of you shall die. Drum. O hard alternative! Say to the king, That we, relying on the knight's own honour, Will urge our suit no farther, but return To our own home in shame. Anna. That shall not be—I'll mark Sir Ronald's air Though he be ranked 'mong thousands, and in guise Yet undescribed. Mess. Nay, I have orders to convey you straight, Well guarded, to the court—You needs must go. Drum. Our ruin is decreed; and all our hopes Dashed to the ground at once.—Of my own life I'm careless—I am weary!—But my child, My wronged, my hapless Annabel! thy truth, And filial love, deserved a happier fate! Anna. Our plea is good, and wears the badge of truth. If justice is not resident in courts, Where is it to be found? Drum. O simple girl! The poor unfriended wight Who hopes for justice in a vicious court, Hopes that, for him, the wolves will change their nature, Or burning fire blaze harmless round his frame. When once corruption's baleful form appears, Though but discernible, all's foul within! A fiend may for a time deceive mankind, Veiled in an angel's robe; but once is seen The cloven tread, his nature's manifest. Our doom is certain: I perceive it all, And none appears to justify or own us! [Exeunt. SCENE III. —A Royal Hall. Sir Ronald as King, seated on high, in a Chair of State; an empty one on his right hand; a Herald at his left. Nobles, Ladies, Attendants, &amp;c. Enter Drummond and Annabel, introduced by the Lord in waiting. The King whispers the Herald. Her. The king commands, if any knight in court Have wed, or plighted troth to this fair maiden, That instantly he do step forth and own her. (A pause.—The king whispers as before.) No one appears.—Then, lady, be it known, All the court lords who hunted in disguise Are here before thee, save one knight alone, Whose feigned name 'tis deemed was Badenoch. If it was he, or if you point the knight, And bring fair evidence of your accusal, You shall have ample justice. (Annabel and Drummond walk arm in arm around the Court, viewing all the Nobles attentively; then return to the front of the stage, as if to talk apart.) Drum. O daughter, fears for thee hath so benumbed me, I can't distinguish one lord from another! Anna. I noted some I knew for nothing good. Sir Ronald is not there; or if he is, I do not know him. Drum. Then all is over!—I'll move heaven and earth For thee, my Annabel. (They turn to the King: Drum. kneels.) O gracious king, Behold a doating, a distressed old man, And this poor harmless maiden, with compassion! When thou becom'st a parent, thou may'st feel What I now suffer— (The king rises much agitated; Annabel screams, then exclaims,) Anna. Sir Ronald! Drum. (Starting up) What dost thou mean, fond girl? Sir Ronald!—Where is Sir Ronald? Anna. The—the—king—(Leans on Drummond's bosom. —The King comes down, and takes Annabel's hand.) King. My love! my beauteous Annabel, forgive me! Yes, Annabel, Sir Ronald is the king,— Fair Scotland's king,—who has not now done that He blushes to acknowledge.—(Seating her by his side.) Thou art my queen! For love, and not for state, thou wedded'st me; Therefore I love and value thee the more. Thy sovereign is thy husband, Annabel:— My dames and nobles all, this is your queen. (All come forward, and make obeisance at once.) Omnes. Long life to our good king and beauteous queen! King Robert and Queen Annabel of Scotland! (Drummond runs up greatly agitated; kneels at their knees, taking hold of their hands.—Curtain drops.) THE END.</field>
