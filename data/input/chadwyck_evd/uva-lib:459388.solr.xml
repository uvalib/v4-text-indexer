      <field name="fulltext">Actus 1. Scena 1. Gripus. Hegio. VVhen gaudy Flora in her prime Observing it was Summer-time With fragrant flowers of each day Had made our mother Tellus gay, The new borne plumed minstrills fills The smiling heaven and ecchoing hills, With chirping musick, ev'ry grone Was made their quire.âOlympick Iove Commanded Aprels balmy shoures, To refresh the March bred flowers, And May perfection in each field To Aprils suckling babes to yield. The spring perfumed this brood, whose smell The Phenix nest might paralell. Now did approach the festivall Of god Silvanus nuptiall To his groue haunting Clarida, Then all the Faunes keept holyday. The nimble faries danc't, and all The dieties agresticall. Claius and kind Phisipile Vow'd loving Man and wife to be. So Clodin did to Colatine, So Serin to his Eglatine, So Cloris did to Coridon, And so delt sheapheards many a one. At length imploring love to be So propitious vnto me, To Mira the faire sheapheardesse In courteous wise, I did addresse My hand, my heart, my cap, my coyne, With all the good I could conjoyne, But she coy thing, refus'd to prove What gentle Hymen is, or loue. As pevish Daphne fled away From the illustrator of the day; Even so my sight coy Mira flies, My sighes she slights, my suit denies. When glorious Sol hath turn'd his back, And all the world is hung with black. Sleepe (natures soft-nurse) flyes my eyes, My mind's ore-cast as are the skies. When vailes are drawne, and dim fac'd night Have againe resign'd her right. To Phosphorus traine, when Titans head, Is washed from his Sea-greene bed, To shew his hoary looks, my griefe 'Gaine urge my tongue to beg reliefe To ease my minde, you Gods above, Or let me dye, or make her love. Hegio. Propitious more betide the friend, good day, Joves spangled Canopie protect thee still; May he himselfe from's Saphire colour'd throne Descend to be thy guardian, good day. Gripus. Wish me good day? it stands in idle stead, My Mira's coy, all my good dayes are dead. Hegio. Cheare up sad Gripus, or the cause declare, Why thou art thus plung'd in a deepe fit of Unprofitable melancholy, what? Hast made a case of spissified teares For thy swoll'n eyes, which are to limbicks turn'd Through which a running pearly torrent flow That lay the dust thy stamping feet doth raise. What unexpected stratagem have thus Perplext thy minde, exil'd thy judgement, and Condens'd thy understanding, and betray'd Thy spirits to disquiet passions. As frolick and as joviall I have knowne thee, As any of Paris followers, why then Dost terminate the sad Catastrophe And period of each sentence, with a sigh, A deepe, a farre-fetcht-sigh, such as would seeme The stuctures rafters for to cleave in sunder, But where such griefe I find, needs must I wonder. Gripus. Cupid hath fixt a golden shaft in me, Which makes me love, but into Mira's breast Have shot a leaden, a hate-causing dart, To love, and not to be belov'd againe, Is misery counted by each rustick Swaine. Hegio. Is love thy doloriferous disease? Quench, quench those smothring sparks, lest suffered They kindle, and increase into a flame, An inauspicious, and perpetuall flame. And like the glowing Amazonian cell, Scorch all that doe approch it nigh, and last Like fire-spitting Ãtna wast its selfe. Amour la fut jamais ou sans peur, ou sans pleurs. Love never was without both feares and teares. Let then the bucket of thy courage stout, Draw so much reason out of the noble well Of thy understanding, as soone will quench This childish, and unmanly agony. What sad disterous torches Hymens light At every nuptiall? what unfortuate hands Sincke in the circle of the wedding ring, Nought breed in bridal sheets, but pinching feares, Iarres, discontents, suspitions, jelousies, Which nought but parting death can terminate. If kinder Hymen prove propitious, And vexe thee not with these; a barren wombe, A curse as cruell, may annoy thee still, Or else abortive births thy joy may kill. Or if with setled hope her time she goes, And then invite Lucina to her throwes, Or by hood-winkt mischance, or open blame, Why may not Atropos for Lucina come. If that infest thee not, tis small delight To see a little wanton ride a cock-horse Upon a painted staffe, or heare him chatter, Like a taught Sterling, Parret, or hoarse pye. I'de rather fill a barne full then a bed; More profit tis to have a crooked plough Still going, then a tottering cradle rocke. But more then that, these I terme foolish men, (But foolish is the Amorists epithite, Ou peut a peine aymer ensemble estre sage, One scarse can be both wife, and love, together) That ere will trust their honour in a Burke, Made of so flight weake bulrush as woman, Apt every fleeting minute for to sincke it. And how canst thou expect fidelity, In the disloyall sex call'd feminine. Remember fiftie sisters, Belus daughters, Who all (save one) made of their husbands slaughters. And both th' Atrides had their envied lives Endanger'd by the falsehood of their wives. Euriphile (false Hag) her husband sould To Poliayces for a chaine of gould. And Queene Euridice conspired How to deliver to grim visag'd death Her regall Lord, and husband to enthrone In his voyd roome her fancied Sonne in Law. The fierce Medea did delacerate Absyrtus tender members, to escape Her Fathers pursute, if we may rely On the report of sage Antiquity. Grip. Thou pleadst against thy selfe, Ile turn the point Of thy last daggar into thine owne breast. Thou sayst Medea tore in twaine her brother Absyrtus, tis confest, 'twas to discover Her ardent, and firme setled desire To follow Jason, ungratefull Jason, Who after that, left her and all her charmes, To clap another Lady in his armes. So have I seene a Horse-leach oft embrace, Cleave to and hang upon some bloud-swoln face, Till its owne turne be serv'd, it holdeth fast, Untill his panch be full, then drop at last. But to our taske. Penelope liv'd chaste, Though twice five years her royall Lord was gone, Did not Ãneas flie, and leave his sword To let out over-credulous Dido's bloud. When as Hiero blam'd his wife, 'cause she, Never inform'd him of his stinking breath. I thought (quoth she) that all mens breaths smelt so. Arria when Petus was condem'd to dye, First stab'd her selfe, then giving him the steele, This wound (deare Petus grieves me not quoth she) But that which thou must give thy self grieves me. The Minians wives having obtained leave, To say valete to their dying Lords, Exchang'd their habits, and expos'd themselves (In their escaped Spouses roomes) unto The penalty of the offended Law. Dona the partner of her husbands woe, With him a long way (as his Page) did goe. When Conrad gave the Matrons leave to beare, From Weinsberg foe-girt town what best they lik't, Each tooke up her owne husband on her backe. Cornelia Annia did prostrate lye, On her defunct Lords Sepulchre, and dye; For this cause annually a paire of Doves Are sacrific'd to their firme setled loves. And happy Phillacides loyall wife, From death redeem'd him with the losse of life. But in my uncertaine waies hath Phillis gone. To find her runnagate Demophoon. Hegio. Humanum est errare, I confesse, Both sexes then are faulty; but what else Doe thy deluded eyes discover in Thy Mira, that thy heart should fancy her. Ist for her skin-deep beauty (her chiefest pride) That's but times fading flowre, which as tis Most delicate, is as volatious. Its like unto the Colours Phidias drew, Which seemed most admirable to the view, But suddenly did vanish and impaire, At the weake puff of each aeriall breath. A wife is but a faire affliction. Symonides reputed her to be, The Shipwrack of a man, the tempest of A house, the troubler of quiet rest. A prison of life, a plague assiduall, A sumptuous conflict, a necessary evill, A horrible care, an ordinary battell, A dayly hinderance, the humane slavery, A faire Aspe, an inevitable paine, A pleasant damage, a domestick strife. If then coy Mira scorne with thee to dwell, On earth leave her to leade bruit Apes in hell. Gripus. Quote not these Accherontick Anchorites. Those stollid moatheaten Foolosophers, That libell against Angels, those night-birds That doe defile even their owne nests, nay worse, That strangle sacrilegiously the fames Of their owne mothers; Those ungracious brats That impiously requite with Stygian Inke The Nectar which indugently they lent them. Heed not the hissing of that viperous brood Of Parricides to their own mothers names. A female is the second part of man, She is a male i'th the newest edition, A wife's the best of her Lords movable. For such a one fierce Champions have prov'd tame, The stoutest Souldiers trembled, and look wan, Ready to give their ghost up at a frowne, The oracles of wit and Philosophy, Have been loves fooles, and bent their litterature, But to expresse great loves Supremacie, And the extent of its Dominions. Nay under Venus sacred Ensignes march, Etheriall troopes of high mounted gods. Hegio. Well, each man as he likes, but should the mad Disloyall Sycophant, whose spheare is woe, Attempt to shoot a raving shaft at me, In's many peeces I would make't recoile Upon his corps, as there be golden sands, In the Pactolian or Tagean shores. Gripus. Cease, cease, good Hegio, to repine at love, Atlantas pace was staid by golden balls. And gods themselves are oft ensnar'd by love, For they have slipt beyond their skill in that, They have made beauty of a greater force Then they themselves are able to resist. For LÃ¦da, Jove became a wandring Swan, And for Europia a loud lowing Bull, And for Antiopa a Satyre rude, And for bright Danae a storme of Ore. Did not Apollo leave his burnish't throne, Lay by his tresses? and in humane shape, Most humbly beg a boone at beauties gate? Did not Alcides for Jole's sake With huge oft draw the slender threed. He was tane captive by his captives looke, She tooke the Conquerour that had her tooke. Kind Paris for to steale his dainty peece, Travell'd as farre as betwixt Troy and Greece. And Perseus amongst the Negroes sought, And faire Andromade from Jnde brought. Cupid can make the Regall Lyon sport, In amorous dalliance with the frisking Kid. Venus can yoake the ravenous and fell kite, With milder Swans in the same Chariot; Immane rapacious Eagles she can linck And timorous silver-brested Doves together. When she commands all animalls lay by Their contrarieties, and antipathy. Exit. Hegio. Enjoy, sir, your conceit, but for my part, I am invulnerable, thou blind Boy Shalt never take me captive, I am like Achilles dipt in Styx, nor doe I feare Thy boy-ships shafts, goe play with angry Bees And painted Butterflies, and at the Wasps nest, And when th' art stung, in thy mams lap goe rest. Scena 2. Venus. Cupid. Hearke Cupid and revenge, this prophane Swaine Do's slight thy quiver, and blaspheme thy bow, He sayes he's shot-proofe, scornes thy archery, Scoffes at thy skill. Cupid. Ile penetrate his heart, Ile make him be an earnest Votary Unto a marble-hearted female Saint. Ile melt to amorous thoughts his soule of stone, Ile torture 'm in loves torrid, frigid Zone. Ile make him in the same flames freez, and fry, The world shall be inamour'd of his woe, Ile find a Shepherdesse in whom he'le joy, And this his darling I will soone infect With coynesse and with nicenesse, for her sake. His morning Orisons shall nothing be But numbers of innumerable sighs, Which he shall count by pearly teares, not beads. Ile make the cherries of her ruby lips The onely cordials for to sustain His loathed life, and those shall be like to Fugacia poma, which like Tantalus He alwaies shall desire, and alwaies misse. Ile make him view the place where she hath set, And thither he shall repaire, as if he thought, The place some soveraigne vertue did containe To ease him, and to cure his gnawing paine. Venus. Let him not wander far from home to seeke Deepe streames in which to wash his frisking flockes. Let such uncessant flouds flow from his eyes As may supply the want of rivolets, Let his pin'd cheekes and hollow countenance, Affight all wolves from his secure sheepe, Let him spend all his daies in pinching griefe, And melancholy discontents; and looke Like to a wither'd tree o're-growne with drosse. Let his illetable and pensive sighes, Scare all rapacious, and omenous Ravens From picking out the eyes of his young Lambs Bleating for nutriment unto their dammes. Cupid.

Betray'd my mother, and the god of warre. Unto the sooty, black, club-footed dolt, As he was tempering of a thunder-bolt, For to revenge this wrong, I made him prove, The power of my golden shaft and love.

Hegio solus. But sure I was not borne Minerva-like? Nor did fond Paracelsus teach my Sire To make a man without conjunction, What furious madnesse did possesse my brest To flout at love? and wrong the femal sex? And to requite in a sharpe Satyrs straine, The roundelayes, and charming lullabies, That my indulgent genetrix did warble? What are my braines grown dry, or my bloud cold? Or am I on a sudden waxen old? I thought, though Cupids aire-deviding shaft, Soone penetrated the well tempered Corsset: which the hot-halting god of fire, Made for his boysterous rivall, it should not find, Or make a way to vulnerate my mind. And therefore Venus I blaspem'd thy sonne, But now I sing a Palinodia. Alas I have beheld that lovely face That from her eyes shot Cupids into mine, T'abuse my sight, and worke upon my frailty, With their smooth oratory to undoe me, Among thy other trophies let me be, Kind Cupid, Hertan Porrigo to thee, Me thinks soft love hath lately made a breach Into the batter'd bulworks of my breast, And there commandeth all my yeelding powers, Which now insulteth in their vassalage. One looke hath struck my soule into a feaver, Me thinks affection whispereth in my eare Faire Daris name, Daris the shepherdesse; An object beautified with the choice gifts Of liberall nature, and of vertue too, My wandring eye hath made my heart receive So good opinon of the forenam'd Nymph, And hourely it solliciteth my tongue, To trie my fortune, and to let it know, Whether its like in Daris love to rest In happy blisse, and blissefull happinesse; Which if deny'd, its suddenly prepared, To leave my skelliton unto grim death. But courage Hegio, let not cold despaire Chill thy greene, and wide-gaping wounds too fast; She is a woman, and she may be wonne, Venus Adonis lov'd, why may not she Prove love-sick too, and at length fancie me: Shall I be bashfull then, and so expire With griefe; fie, fie, what shall a womans eye Prevaile so farre o're me to cause me dye, And leave my name in the fooles Callender, And there be noted with a rubie letter, For a supereminent Festivall; No, I am loath to leave earth yet, Ile try If I may live, and find a remedie. Exit Scena 4. Chorus of Faires. Bright PhÅbus who with morning light Put'st Hesperus twinckling traine to flight, When as thou rowzest, and display Thy golden locks, and summon day; Thou who dost rest thy drowzie-head, In aged Thetis froathy bed: When as thy gilded Car of day, His glowing axle doth allay. Thou who in twice 6 Months fulfill Thy journall on th' Olympian hill, Illustrious Lord of light, in vaine Thou bragg'st with arrowes to have slaine Thy Python sterne, whose massie bones Were Iron barres, like congeal'd stones His knotty sinewes were, the boughes Wer's shady covers; his great troughes Deepe Rivolets, which he (well nigh) Caroused at one watering dry: His belching shot forth flames, his eye Shin'd like the dapled morning skie. Faire Venus thy young hood winkt sonne More glorious trophies oft have won, Thou that crown'st thy loves with bayes, Inventer of mellodious Layes. Thou left'st Pernassus bifork't hill, And Tempe thy faire domicill, At loves command, and all to be At Daphne's shrine a Votary. Thou that did'st by virtuall heat The happy plants, and herbes create, Couldst find no plant, or herbe to be A medicine for loves maladie. When thou commandst the birds to bring, In triumph to the world, the Spring, The new-clad earth hath quickly lost Her Snow-white roabes, no chilly frost Candies the grasse, no ycie creame Congeale the lake, or pearly streame; No snow lies sheltred in the shade, The earth is thaw'd and tender made: For all thy heat, thy love doth lowre, Nor had thy scalding rayes the power To thaw her Marble yce, and this T'was caus'd her Metamorphosis. Large limb'd Hercules trebly blest With fame, thou who in youth exprest Deedes of honour, thy cradle's crownd With brave achivements, which renown'd Thy name; thy valour was suppli'd With strength, thy haughty spirit defi'd An hoast of men, Heaven ne're conjoyn'd So strong a body, or so stout a mind. 1. Brag not cause you slew and withstood Within the thick NÃ¦mÃ¦an wood A beast, the temper of whose heart Was like a nether Milstone; Dart, Nor threatning Sword, nor frightfull Speare, Could terrifie it with Panick feare: Like knotty wreaths of craggy brasse His sinewes were, a noise did passe From's mouth, which might strike deafe the eares Of mortals, and affright the Spheres; You wore his ruggid shaggie hide About your shoulder, and left side. 2. The Hydra by thy hand was slaine, Whose heads lopt off sprouted againe. The mud was made his downie bed, The stones were pillowes for his head, His speckled jawes which hideous were, Thy brawny armes did boldly teare. 3. Thy club made th' Erymanthean Beare. Lye weltring in his ruddy goare, His sharpened tusks shall spoile no more (As it was wont to doe before) Arcadia, which in antique dayes Did warble out her well-tun'd Layes, And sing loves on her oaten reed, Whilst her secure flocks did feed. 4. The Centaure thou subdu'st by force, Halfe like a man, halfe like a horse. 5. Swifter then wind you ran, or thought, On foot a running Stag you caught. 6. Rapacious bird Stymphalide, Were made a prey to death by thee. 7. Thou mighty Scavinger wert able To clense the foule Augean stable, 8. You made a Bull to crosse the Maine, And graze on Neptunes liquid plaine. 9. And Diomedes fell monster, Who made his captives provender To his proud pamper'd steeds, by thy Revengefull hand did justly dye. 10. False Cacus thou didst crush to death, And 'twixt thy armes squeeze out his breath: 11. Cease the adjuring world to tell Of thy forc't entrance into Hell. You swadled Charon with his oare, The triple-headed ban-dog roare, And yelle: you Pluto ere you're gone Confronted on his jeaty throne. 12. Hesperides fruit, sweet and gay, By thee were stolen, and borne away. By Juno's labours you war'nt broke, And yet you yeelded to loves yoake. Thus Love made Hegio to espie Sweet Daris Phisiognomy, And prove close pris'ner to that eye, Whose frownes make him prepar'd to dye, Love wound her too, that we may all Keepe holyday at their Nuptiall.

My drooping head, my deepe contracted brow, My bloudlesse cheeks, dead eyes, pale lips, faint tongue, Shall strive in each point thine to equalize.

Whilst thus she sung, the winds grew whist, the wild Incensed Beares, and Panthers proved mild, Amazed I a fixed tree did prove, But wonder blasted trees did dance, and move, Each bends his palsie tops to worship her, And turne obsequious Idolater, Her Lyrick ayres intic't the ravish't quire Of birds to come, which (being come) admire. The scaly fish to heare her voice did lay Upon the waters top, and frisk, and play. Ere while I fondly thought love could convay (Although he's deified) no other way, But through the gazing eyes, into the heart His love-infected, keene and fatall dart, But whilst I heard this smooth-tongu'd Syren sing On the harmonious aier-deviding wing Of her sweet voice, it plainely did appeare, That subtile love could enter at the eare. Long time I stood amaz'd, at length vow'd I To live by her propitious smiles, or dye By rigorous frownes shot from her awfull eye.

She mounted sate upon a happy hillock. Clad in the verdent plush of Madam Nature, In twisted braids of silver Lillies knitting, The loose traine of her amber dropping haire.

CÃ¦lia's locks so aptly twin'd, Each haire would bind Olympick Jove, In a strong twisted net of love, If to descend downe he assumes His Eagles plumes, These baires will change their hue, and grow Hoary and cold, as melting snow. 3. Like to a comely field of Snow Now shewes her brow, Rutts shall betray Ere long, and wrinkles deep display, Times plough have furrowed her brow. An Ice shall flow Through ev'ry veine, she shall discry Pale Death displaid in her dimme eye. 4. Each beame shot from her eye so gray Creates the day, That eye oft made By winkes, the noone-day Sunne a shade, Now it is youthfull Cupids nest, 'Tis at the best.

This musick stupifi'd my ravisht eares, And wrought an emulation in the Spheares. The Eccho listned to her warbled tones, And told their Joyes for every word aloud. Whilst she did subtly charme my listning eare, Love emptied his quiver on my heart. Musick so thaw'd my Adamantine mind, That not an arrow did resistance find. Thus did my Tyrant celebrate the prize, Act, and present, the triumph of her eyes, So Nero once with harp in hand survai'd His burning Rome, and as it flam'd, he plaid But to proceed, I begg'd great Iuno's blessing, T'attend my hopefull suite in the suppressing Loves common foes, disdaine, and nicetie.

And I have heard an old blancient boet say that Megander swum through Hell to his Hero, I thinke hee was a Goose to doe so; And yet my Zonne Tom did more the 'tother day, he leapt over a high wall, and waded through a deepe moate past his depth, to git to Margery. As I came up at the butt londs end, I met him in that case, but O, how did I bemire, and wonder, to see his new slop and all his cloathes bejeered with the mud of the pond he ran through. The old Boet I bominated before, said, That when folke fell in love, a blind naked boy, he called him Stupid, shot them, 'Twas he shot my Zonne Tom, by the Maskins I would give the best cow in my yard, to find out this raskall Stupid, and I would thrash him, as I did the Henne last Shrove-tuesday.

What pleasures Poets fame of after death, In the Elizean arbusted groves, Shall spread themselves 'fore you, as if you were Tenants, or Farmers of those blessed shades, It shall be a perpetuall Spring, where you Inhabit, all disasterous dewes, and blasts Shall strangers to your happy pastures be. Come follow me, this my well-lighted flame Shall light you unto Ceres Tempell, where (Expecting you) they Nuptiall garlands weare, That hold your hearts enain'd in their golden haire. Exeunt. Scena 6. Chorus of Fairies. Ring out yee Christall Spheares, Once blesse our listning eares, Let your sweet silver chime (Keeping harmonious time) Carroll forth your loud layes In the winged wantons praise. Mab thou Majestick Queene Of Fairies, be thou seene To keep this holyday, Whilst we dance and play, And frisk it as we goe O'th light fantastick toe. The Satyres and the Fawnes Shall nimbly crosse the Lawnes, O're tawny sands, and shelves, Trip it yee dapper Elves, Dance by the fountaine brim Nymphs deck't with Daisies trim, Come Lovers all in rowes, With your blith and jolly browes, With flowry chaplets crown'd, Come Lovers walke a round This Village, Venus say, Annually this day Her Sonnes triumphs shall be, Lovers expresse your glee. Exeunt cantantes.</field>
