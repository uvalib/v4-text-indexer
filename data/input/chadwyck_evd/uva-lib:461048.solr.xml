      <field name="fulltext">MUTIUS SCÆVOLA; OR, THE ROMAN PATRIOT. AN HISTORICAL DRAMA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Historic page records the most energetic and luminous examples of public and private virtue, while it is also shadowed with the ebon tints of moral delinquency.—Combining thus every trait of human conduct, it becomes an instructive guide, and offers a fertile source for dramatic composition. The reader will no doubt feel an interest in those facts which form the basis of our play, the outlines of which are as follow:— Mutius Scævola, surnamed Cordus, was a Roman famous for his courage and intrepidity. When Porsenna, king of Etruria, had besieged Rome, to re-instate Tarquin in his rights and privileges, Mutius determined to deliver his country from so dangerous an enemy. Having disguised himself in the habit of a Tuscan, and being perfect master of that language, he gained an easy introduction into the camp, and thence into the royal tent; where finding Porsenna conversing alone with his secretary, he immediately rushed on the latter, and mistaking him for his royal master, plunged a dagger into his heart. He then surrendered himself to the guard, who, alarmed at the noise, had just entered the tent. When interrogated respecting the motives that had urged him to so desperate an act, Mutius boldly replied:—That he was a Roman;—that he had thus entered the camp in disguise, to deliver his countrymen from the tyranny of Porsenna;— and that three hundred Roman youths, like himself, had sworn to destroy him, or perish in the attempt. Then sternly fixing his eyes on the king, he laid his right hand on an altar of burning coals, and without uttering a groan suffered the flames to consume it. This extraordinary act of heroism, added to the confession made by Mutius, so astonished Porsenna, that he made peace with Rome, and retired from the city. Mutius obtained the surname of Scævola, for having lost the use of his right hand, by burning it in the presence of the Etrurian king. History farther instructs us, that the generosity of Porsenna's behaviour to the captives was so much admired by the Romans, that to record his humanity, they erected a brazen statue to his memory. The author has deviated in some few particulars from the original story, and has blended other incidents, to form, as he hopes, an interesting Drama. W. H. I. LONDON, June 27th, 1801.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. WRITTEN BY MR. FELTHAM. OUR Bard this night, a foe to German rule, Erects his fabric on the ancient school: He courts ye not with pantomimic show, But wou'd your souls inspire with patriot glow: He wou'd not sorrow's liquid gem controul, But nerve the Briton with a Roman soul. He speaks of Freedom, and that country's laws, Which Europe oft has echo'd with applause; Whose arms maintain'd their gods, their rights, and land, And boldly tam'd a proud invading band. The hero of our play, a Roman youth, Whose god was Virtue, and whose leader Truth, Whose soul, despising death, dar'd still be free, And ventur'd life—to save Rome's liberty. Yes! Mutius, burning with heroic zeal, Made Love subservient to the public weal: Fled e'en from her who own'd his fondest praise, To reap in Honor's field th'immortal bays. The stage of old was form'd to rouse the sire, And virtue in each gazer's breast inspire: Immoral acts, however gloss'd, were seen, As syrens are, not trusted by their mien. The mask torn off, the hideous offspring shown, Was instant banish'd 'mid the general groan. 'Tis practice that inures to deeds of shame; Be ours the task to gain the patriot's name: Let Roman virtues grace the British breast, Let Britons dying wear the Roman crest. Awake, my countrymen! dispel the dream, Nor longer seek delight from Folly's theme; Correct the stage, that so each scene may pass, As Virtue's self, reflected in a glass. So shall each British youth with ardor burn, And twine victorious wreaths around his urn: So shall each virgin by her actions prove, That magnanimity engenders love.— Be you the arbiters; and if to-night The theme of virtue shoud enchant your sight, Usurp that pow'r which you alone possess: Let Thespians once more charm in virtue's dress; Let Mutius' bold example lead the way, And fire each Briton with his godlike ray; That burning with the love of Freedom's cause, Britons wou'd die to save their country's laws.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene—Before Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Etrurian Camp. PORSENNA (coming forward). Propitious Fortune smiles upon our arms: The bold presumptuous sons of Rome are tam'd, And supplicate in vain the angry gods To stir in their behalf. Methinks I see These haughty spirits bow'd beneath the weight Of dire misfortune. Clos'd within their walls, In throngs they pour their lamentations forth, And weary Jove with futile prayers. No more Their conquering legions scour the fertile plains; Their senators, their aged and their young, Their matrons, wives, and virgins, bend alike The stubborn knee, and to their altars cling, Rending the air with vows, with groans, and tears. Gods! how my soul rejoices at the thought, Since in my grasp is plac'd th'avenging rod To scourge this proud and daring race, whose arms So oft have bow'd Etruria's sons in fight, And made us wear the Roman yoke. LENTELLUS. Most royal sir, to you our country owes The glorious conquest of their legion'd hosts: The palsied foe shrinks at thy martial name, And, terror struck, contemplates all thy deeds. Porsenna is at once the Romans dread, And bless'd Etruria's boast. PORSENNA. And what befits the monarch's crown so well As love from those who own the sceptr'd sway, And bow submissive to their country's laws? I seek not to conciliate faction's hate, But live in good men's hearts: the praise of vice Is ever by the virtuous mind contemn'd: 'Tis baneful as the pestitential wind, On which rides meagre death. Th'applause of vice Blots out fair virtue from the soul that's prais'd, And singles it for infamy. LENTELLUS. Such ne'er will prove Porsenna's lot. His acts, Weigh'd in the scale of justice, claim alike The smile of gods, the love of worthy men. PORSENNA. Tell me, Lentellus, are our proffered terms Now forwarded to Rome? LENTELLUS. A messenger, by dawn dispatch'd, bore hence Your summons to the Roman senate. PORSENNA. 'Tis well:— Let them at large discuss the weighty point, Still shall they bow submissive to my will, And own me for a conqueror. If, stern, They dare my clemency deride, and bar Against victorious troops their city's gates, To-morrow's dawn will I besiege proud Rome, And level with the earth its massive walls: Etrurian swords shall bathe in Roman blood; Consuming flames shall rage on every side, And with its spoils my legions will return Triumphant to their friends and countrymen. LENTELLUS. Swell'd with the pride of conquest, even now Each soldier burns with godlike emulation: Their big hearts, eager for the glorious fray, Tumultuous throb against their manly breasts, And nerve them with a more than mortal fire. I would the senate, deaf to our demand, Return'd us bold defiance; for I thirst To root this warlike people from the soil. Ev'n as a gentle stream, by torrents swell'd, O'erflows its banks, and deluges around The fertile plains: so, gradually increas'd, This pigmy tribe, to mighty numbers grown, Against their neighbours bear the hostile steel, And seem to covet universal sway. PORSENNA. Lentellus, hold! Sweet mercy is the attribute of gods, And graces more the hero than his spoils, Or pining captives to his chariot leash'd. My friend, the Roman pride is humbled now, The gods forefend that we should crave more blood. For me, I trust they will not madly spurn The good that's tender'd; but with open arms, Not as victors, but as friends, embrace us. Yet soft! Trumpet sounds. Yon trumpet's clangor speaks the herald near. Enter Etrurian Herald with a Roman messenger. Our fix'd determination being known, What answer bring'st thou from the Senate? ROMAN. Porsenna, as a Roman I shall speak; For well I know your manliness of soul Will not the frankness of my tongue despise. I plead my country's cause,—the cause of Rome. My speech, untutor'd in the whining phrase Of honied flattery, shall quick unfold The answer of our reverend rulers. Porsenna wills that Romans should be slaves— And Romans will defend their liberty: Propitious gods smile on Porsenna's arms— Fate frowns on Rome, still Romans dare be free. You would my countrymen should own the yoke, And place reliance on your clemency— We cannot bend before Etruria's king, Nor shame our gods, our country, and our rights. Such terms as honor dictates we will hear. We know, the worst that can befall is death: And who so base but would resign his life To save him from dishonour? Porsenna would not hesitate in this; His valour and his virtues stamp him Man: Then why should Romans, by a deed of shame, Insure Porsenna's hate?—If, less severe, You proffer terms becoming manly souls, Our senators will purchase peace; if not, Romans know how to die. PORSENNA. Roman, attend! Not to dispraise bold virtue would I speak, For I do reverence thy country's deeds, Yet inwardly lament the tides of blood Wherein Etruria's sons ere long must bathe Their vengeful hands. My injur'd people's cause Hath urg'd me to adopt a conqueror's phrase, Nor can I vary in my fix'd intent; But on this bold defiance must proceed, And hurl destruction on thy daring race. —'Tis thus resolv'd: And to your senate therefore bear my words; Still adding, that Porsenna grants this day For further consultation. ROMAN. Our senators demand no lenity: Porsenna is resolv'd, and so are they. We'll to the last defend our city's rights, And, nobly buried in its ruin'd walls, Purchase a glorious and immortal grave. [Exit. PORSENNA. Conduct him safe without the camp.— Lentellus, they decide as thou requir'st; My proferr'd friendship is with boldness spurn'd, And I must frame my soul to deeds of death. To thy charge do I yield the dread attack— To-morrow's dawn must to our soldiers' rage The spoils of Rome consign. LENTELLUS. Aye, and the senators and people's blood Shall pay this bold presumption.—What is Rome, That it should haughtily defy the foe Whose conqu'ring arms have tam'd its children's pride, And even now, before their walls encamp'd, Threaten with famine, flame, and sword conjoin'd, To lay its altars with the humble dust? What is this race—which boasts descent from gods, That it should contumeliously despise The terms of friendship and the shafts of death? Curse on their pride!—but they shall rue the dawn: Yes, by our gods, to-morrow's rising sun, Crowning yon city with its golden beams, Shall give it, like a gay deck'd sacrifice, To slaughter and eternal ruin. PORSENNA. My friend, thy dauntless courage stands confess'd, And bold achievements claim thy sov'reign's praise: Yet, why this vengeance and this thirst of blood? I reverence the actions thou contemn'st, And rather weep than vaunt their dire effects. Thou must, to gain Porsenna's love entire, Root vengeance from thy breast; it is a vice That blots from out the catalogue of fame The conqueror's deeds, and slurs the hero's name. LENTELLUS. Belike you do forget, most royal sir, Your slaughter'd subjects' ghosts that shriek aloud, And cry for vengeance on their murderers. PORSENNA. They nobly fought their mother-country's cause; They died in her defence; and therefore rest, Freed from the passions of this mortal state, In bless'd Elysium. The soldier's spirit, 'ray'd in honor's garb, Ne'er shrieks for vengeance—Nor fame, nor conquest, Nor spoils of war with multitudinous shouts, So well become the man as Clemency— Without this attribute, the laurel wreath Fades on the victor's brow; but, grac'd with this, The breath of malice cannot blast its bud; It weathers all the rude assaults of fate, And wears an everlasting bloom. LENTELLUS. I shall endeavour so to frame my thoughts, That they may henceforth meet Porsenna's praise. PORSENNA. Think not I'd chide thee, good Lentellus:—no; I would but cull a noxious weed, that mars The growth of virtue's plant.—Thou shalt be all Thy sovereign's heart can wish, not merit half Porsenna's love. [Exit with attendants. LENTELLUS (solus). Curse on his noble qualities, they blaze, And like the noontide sun absorb the beams Of every lesser orb.—Why do I shrink, And like the silvery moon confess his power, Wasting whene'er he darts his godlike rays Athwart my envious soul? I know not why, Yet there's in virtue's tone a 'witching charm That doth unbend the purpose of my soul And make me reverence the theme I hate.— Down, busy thought! and in thy place arise The drowning voice of bold Ambition.—Who But Lentellus now shall lead to vengeance, And thus the soldiers' love obtain? To me Deputed is the slaughter of the foe And sacking of proud Rome—this well shall aid, And onward spur my dread intent—Once gain'd The base plebeian voice, I'll mask no more The love of sov'reignty wherewith I'm fir'd. This hand shall beat the opposing barrier down, And satiate my ambition with a crown. [Exit. SCENE II. (without the Camp.) Enter Silvia, disguised as an Etrurian officer. SILVIA. What mingled sweets and sorrows wait on love: The wounded heart, like one that crops a rose, Forgets the thorn while gazing on the flower, And, pleas'd, ne'er heeds the sting. The giddy boy, Who climbs from branch to branch the lofty tree, Thinks not of danger, till the summit gain'd, He bends his look below. So is't with love, Whose smart yields pleasure, and whose pleasure's pain. [Lentellus entering in the back ground, pauses on hearing Silvia sing. SONG. Love is a soft consuming fire, That stings with bonied dart; A flame that never will expire, When kindled in the heart. Love is more restless than the wave, More varying than the wind; The lover is fell passion's slave; To prudence love is blind. Love is a rosy-winged boy, That lures you with his smile; But should you with the urchin toy, Your peace he will beguile. His shaft is keen, his hand is true, To fly him were but vain, The pleasing smart will still pursue, 'Tis pleasure, and 'tis pain. What will not Love defy?—The season's change, The ocean's perils, and portending death, All shrink before the majesty of Love. Where'er it strikes, 'tis sole divinity, And reigns unrivall'd here. Else why this guise, This bold assumption of the manly port? Why have I sought the rugged soldier's fare? Why for a camp abandon'd is my home, And, in the place of sweet domestic toils, Do I the shield and massive weapon bear, Nor shrink before the blood-smirch'd brow of Mars? For whom but thee, lov'd Manlius, do I thus My womanhood unsex, and, in despite Of worldly custom and a virgin's shame, The converse of the rude licentious tongue, And revelry unbridled, hear?—'Tis Love, 'Tis Manlius that hath wrought this mighty change; Who, by these outward robes deceiv'd, to me, As to a friend, his secrets doth impart. But soft! he comes. Enter Furius Manlius. MANLIUS. My friend, my Junius, I have sought thee long— Why wander'st thou alone without the camp, When Manlius needs thy soothing voice to lull The inward perturbation of his soul? My love-distemper'd mind is link'd to thine By Friendship's sacred bond: thine every word Both calms and nourishes this inward fire: Thy prudent counsels, breath'd into mine ear, Like cooling zephyrs lull my raging breast; But being absent, fiercer burns the flame; Then all is madness, love, and Silvia. SILVIA. Becalm thy troubled mind; let Reason's hand Still temper all thy thoughts: as dew from heaven, The voice of Reason, whispering to thy soul, Will all the feverish heat of Love allay, And rock thee in the arms of gentle peace. What would'st thou, Manlius? Is not Sylvia thine? Did not her virgin heart proclaim its love, When with Etruria's sons thou took'st the field? Hast thou not dwelt with rapture on the thought? Hast thou not told me how she wept, and sigh'd, And the bless'd gods implored in thy behalf? And would'st thou more from maiden coyness? MANLIUS. Yes, my Junius: I would the sum of love were now complete; That Sylvia by the nuptial bond were mine For ever. How long will our conqu'ring troops, Already sated with the blood of Rome, Delay the wish'd-for peace? When shall we greet Our native soil, our kindred, and our loves? SILVIA. Rely on fate, my friend; whose smiles till now Have beam'd upon our arms; whose outstretch'd hand Hath still preserv'd thee from the hostile steel For scenes of future bliss? Think on the day When, with a victor's emulation swell'd, Thine arms will clasp a mistress' throbbing breast, When tears of joy will grace a mother's eye, And rapt'rous smiles to view a conquering son Play on thine aged father's brow! Oh, think— And let the contemplation cheer thy heart! MANLIUS. My Junius, fancy kindles at thy words: E'en now methinks these arms ungirded lay, And naught but sounds of peace and happiness Swell on the passing wind: A father's praise, A mother's and a virgin's joyful tears, Enraptur'd do I picture to my sense: Now 'fore the altars of our country's gods In gratitude I seem to crouch the knee, And offer up my soul in fervent pray'r. Junius, thy words are inspiration fraught, And as I look upon thy beardless mien, In pleas'd amaze I'm lost—such youth, such sense, And friendship tried, co-mingle in thy frame, As almost make me bow with reverence. SILVIA. If friendship thus can act, to what extreme Wou'd love and Sylvia urge thy fever'd mind? I fear me, Manlius, thou'rt a truant grown, And that esteem for one that wills thee well, Slackens thy sum of love. MANLIUS. I prithee cease, my friend. What is impossible to love? For love, I'd hie me swifter than the posting wind; This rugged voice I'd fashion to soft phrase; These arms, forgetful of their nervy strength, Should from the distaff twine the flaxen cord. Alike can love with giant strength inspire. Methinks from out the bowels of the earth The rooted oak I could uprend, or tear The flinty bosom of the rock. This voice Should shame the constant roaring of the surge; These eyes the lustre of the sun defy, Dimming the source of light. Oh! I cou'd act What words ne'er figur'd, nor conception thought, So raging is the love wherewith I burn. SILVIA. If so, in peace thou wilt not heed thy friend, But on the sweet remembrance of the past Junius must live—by Manlius forgot. MANLIUS. Nay, nay; think not so meanly of thy friend— Tho' love's a raging and a lasting fire, Yet there's in friendship's voice a silv'ry sound, That steals upon the soul, and fastens there: Junius, I never shall forget thy faith. SILVIA. I do believe thy friendship and thy love; And cou'd I breathe my thoughts in Silvia's ear, My trumpet-tongue should echo forth thy praise, Still kindling more the flame within her breast. But come; we'll to the camp; for e'er this hour Rome's final doom is fix'd. MANLIUS. Obedient to thy voice, my servile steps Still follow thee. Thou art my faithful guide, Whose prudent words recall my wand'ring thoughts, Conducting them in Reason's sober tract. [Exeunt. LENTELLUS (advancing). It is the noble maid! the beauteous fair, Whose haughtiness once scorn'd my proffer'd love, I knew not why. The myst'ry is no more; For in a Manlius I my rival view, Alike the lover, and the well-beloved. And shall I tamely be a looker on, And yield without a blow the precious prize? Such conduct suits but ill my daring thoughts. Lentellus, if thou canst not gain her love, Let hatred dictate thy revenge—Why so? He knows her not; but link'd in friendship's bond, With brotherly affection opes his soul. This chain must straight be sever'd—Jealousy, Thy blasting power shall work my soul's intent. Should he not swallow treason's gilded bait, And fall an easier prey? It is decreed: My slighted love, my hatred both combine— They fall the victims of my just revenge. [Exit. SCENE III. (without the Camp.) Enter Manlius. MANLIUS. He's gone; My Junius, to assay my prudence, flies, And leaves me to indulge those secret thoughts Which henceforth have prov'd foes to Reason's voice. Let my warm fancy own her sober sway; Nor, like a mettled steed, defy controul, And spurn the even rein. But hither comes, With pensive step, the great Porsenna's friend, Our noble chief Lentellus. Enter Lentellus. LENTELLUS. (apparently surprised on beholding Manlius). Welcome, our army's pride, whom long I've sought— How fares the noble Manlius? MANLIUS. More eager after fame, since thus he hears The lavish'd praise from one so great in power As brave Lentellus. LENTELLUS. Thou hast a soldier's mind; a breast that glows With reverence for Etruria and thy friends. MANLIUS. I'd freely bleed to aid my country's rights, And die to serve the chosen of my soul. LENTELLUS. I know thou wou'dst— And to revenge thy kindred and thy friend. MANLIUS. If treachery dealt the blow, I'd seek revenge, And compass it, tho' in the jaws of death. LENTELLUS. Manlius, thou had'st once a brother— MANLIUS. I had, Lentellus; and a brother's love Still mourns his ashes long inurn'd in death. LENTELLUS. He bravely fell—and by a Roman hand. MANLIUS. He died that death which best befits a man— Covered with honor's wounds; with gashes gain'd In brave defence of all we should hold dear, Our land, our gods, our king, and liberty. LENTELLUS. Wou'dst thou embrace thy brother's murderer, In chains and at thy will? MANLIUS. 'Twas not th'assassin's steel that drank his blood; 'Twas man 'gainst man. A Roman arm oppos'd, And fought his country's cause, as did my brother: Such is no murderer: yet such a man I cou'd not fondly link within my arms; All Nature wou'd cry shame upon the deed. Yet being quite defenceless, I wou'd scorn Ignoble vengeance—To the upright soul, No arms so strongly shield a foe from death, As when in chains he waits upon your mercy. LENTELLUS. But in the field— MANLIUS (hastily interrupting him). I'd hunt him, till he own'd my conquering steel, Or sent my soul to seek my brother's shade. LENTELLUS. Revenge might have been thine. MANLIUS. Ye gods! and did it 'scape me in the field? Then curse the dire mischance. LENTELLUS. But for Porsenna, it might still be thine. MANLIUS. Porsenna! LENTELLUS. Aye! His wav'ring soul to Rome wou'd fain grant peace: He shrinks at slaughter and a just revenge. MANLIUS. What mean'st thou, noble chief? LENTELLUS. But for Porsenna, Rome is in our power, And ample vengeance thine. MANLIUS. Rome at our mercy! LENTELLUS. By famine, flame, and sword assail'd. MANLIUS. And therefore on a fallen foe, must I Most dastard-like deal out revenge?—Never— No—rather wither these my sinews up; Grow stiff my joints, and blast my bud of youth, Ere Manlius stoop to such dishonor. LENTELLUS (aside). His virtues mar my plann'd intent.—Treason, Thy flame will never kindle in his breast: Let love and jealousy my purpose work. (Aloud) Manlius, thy virtues now blaze forth indeed; I've rous'd them into action, and applaud That gentle mercy which thou dost uphold. Forgive me, if to learn thy inmost thoughts I practis'd fraud: but friendship urg'd me thus To teach my tongue the language of deceit. MANLIUS. I'm much beholden to Lentellus' love. LENTELLUS (with apparent feeling). I wou'd thy friendship and thy fervent love Met the desert they merit. MANLIUS. What means my chief? LENTELLUS. Does thy soul own no touch of tenderness? Is no fair form engraven there? MANLIUS (with anxiety). Speak, I conjure you. LENTELLUS. Know'st thou the name of Silvia? MANLIUS (strenuously). I do! I do! LENTELLUS. Thou hast a friend— MANLIUS (fervently). Aye, and a tried one, too. LENTELLUS. Then mark my words, most noble, generous youth! Trust not thy love—and of thy friend beware; Beware of Junius. [Exit—Manlius vainly endeavouring to detain him. MANLIUS. What damning words were those: “Trust not thy love, and of thy friend beware!” What wild contagion thro' my soul they spread, And give me up to racking doubts and fears? Will the bless'd gods to vice propitious prove? Will Justice' even scale preponderate, And with the guilty side? Will Phœbus turn His wonted course? Will Nature sterile prove? Or Virtue copulate with Vice? Such things Were likelier far than that my love and friend Should both prove false.—But see where Junius comes— Beneath that front, can villany reside? See how he smiles—the very seal of Truth Is stamp'd upon his brow.—But why those words? What should Lentellus thus to baseness urge? Again I rage with jealousy and love. Enter Silvia. SILVIA. Why this disordered mien? this glaring eye? Those limbs convuls'd? Oh, speak! unveil thy soul, And let not Junius long entreat in vain. MANLIUS. His voice; his air;—ye gods! 'tis basely false, Else could I all my sum of rage retain? Could guilt the searching eye of truth defy, And not be blasted with the gaze?—'Tis false, 'Tis calumny; my Junius is my friend. SILVIA (feelingly). And did thy mind e'er harbour doubt? Just heav'n! That Manlius ever should mistrust his friend! MANLIUS. That look! that starting tear!—it cannot be— For ever from my mem'ry blot the thought— And take the wanderer Junius to my heart— (they embrace.) SILVIA. Yet why the motive of these doubts conceal? Explain—that I may vindicate my truth. MANLIUS. By our dear friendships, I entreat thee cease, Nor further urge my speech. SILVIA. To prove my friendship, I'm for ever mute, Since Manlius will it so. We'll to the camp, And there forget the past. MANLIUS. Lead on—thy friend attends thee. [Exit Silvia. Lentellus shall the secret source unfold Of this base calumny. I'll question home, And either prove my friend and Silvia false, Or gain the liar's name, and vengeance take For this detested machination. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Roman Senate—Senators seated round. Valerius and Lucretius, the two Consuls. VALERIUS. Romans, the crisis of our fate draws near; The angry gods will be obey'd, and we, As Romans, must their vengeance meet. What man But hath so squar'd his course of life, that now He rather courts than shuns that final boon, Where all his blooming virtues meet reward? If any ignominious slave there be, Preferring coward life to death and fame, Let him from out our city freely pass: He's far more baleful than fell hunger's pangs, Or foul contagion? He's Rome's dishonor; By birth a Roman, with a bondsman's soul. LUCRETIUS. Your looks unruffled, colleagues, shew ye firm: There needs no fuel to augment the flame That rages now within your manly breasts: Else cou'd I deeds rehearse that wou'd have spurr'd And into action rous'd your sluggard souls: Else would I proclaim th'Horatii's brave feats, The saviours of their land; or paint anew The Roman virtue of a Brutus' soul, Who gaz'd, with stedfast eye and mien unmov'd, When death—the recompense of trait'rous minds— Inflicted was upon his sons degenerate: Else should a Roman wife have sham'd your breasts, The offspring of MY blood—Lucretia! These eyes beheld her pierce that dauntless heart— That breast which loath'd existence with dishonor. Like me, ye Senators, be fathers all; Let steady virtue be your darling child, And rather die than yield your honours up To foul pollution. [Enter Roman Messenger. But see, the bearer of Porsenna's answer comes; Let him resolve our doubts; let him proclaim The fate of Rome, its laws and liberty. MESSENGER. Most reverend Senators, as you requir'd, I neither humbly sued for terms of peace, Nor by my language gave the foe offence. I told them, Romans never would be slaves; That Roman souls defied the frowns of Fate, And with their liberties would forfeit life. Detraction never should disgrace the tongue Of rugged honesty.—Th'invading king, Altho' th'inveterate enemy of Rome, Is still a generous and a noble chief; For he can praise the virtues of our race, Tho' we defy his power.—Obdurate still, Porsenna softens not his rig'rous terms, But wills that Rome should yield at his discretion: He to the Senate would accord more time For fresh deliberation—I told him, Procrastination would but fruitless prove; That resolution equally became The conquer'd as the conqueror:— Thus having said, I did depart the camp, To make the sequel of my errand known. VALERIUS. The die is cast; yet to the latest hour Shall Rome its freedom and its gods maintain. LUCRETIUS. The manacles of bondage we defy, And laugh to scorn the conqueror and his threats— We prove ourselves in this more great than they: We smile at death;—they bask in fortune's beam: We die, maintaining still our country's rights;— They conquer those whom Fortune hath subdued; They slaughter men by meagre famine wasted, But never can they setter Roman souls; 'Tis freedom—or 'tis immortality. VALERIUS. Since death's inevitable, wherefore thus Supinely wait the blow:—Let's rouse our youth, And boldly bid defiance to the foe: Let's with our blood bedew our native soil— That land which is the envy of the world, The soil of honor and of liberty. Enter Mutius. MUTIUS. Hail, honor'd men, sage rulers of our land! LUCRETIUS. Welcome the valiant Mutius; welcome he Whose arm so oft hath gain'd his country's praise! MUTIUS. Porsenna's answer thro' the city's spread: Plebeians know the worst—The gods be prais'd, They murmur not, but are resolv'd to die. LUCRETIUS. We will not praise their magnanimity: A Roman's virtue springs not from applause, 'Tis rooted in his soul. MUTIUS. Impell'd by that same virtue, rev'rend Sirs, A Roman stands before you—Mutius comes To serve his country with his heart's warm blood: A godlike ardour swells within my breast; It beats in freedom's cause, and seeks to save The Roman state, by sacrifice of life. VALERIUS. We know thy ardour—Mutius hath a soul, Wou'd fain the laurell'd brow of Mars undeck, And bind the verdant wreath upon his own. MUTIUS. Long has my indignation swell'd to see The high blown pride of this usurping band, That wou'd new-fangled laws on us enforce, And level governments and mighty states. Do they believe that Roman liberty Can crouch the knee to their ambitious views: Ours is a freedom which the gods applaud, Since naught can tear its adamantine root From out the souls of those which it hath nurtur'd. But to be brief, and not in words to waste The precious time which deeds should chronicle, Myself and other Roman youths have sworn To compass freedom by Porsenna's death. Clad in Etrurian raiments, I the first The honor of this enterprize demand, Since 'twas myself that did the feat propose. LUCRETIUS. 'Tis nobly, bravely, and yet rashly thought: We must applaud the mind that cou'd conceive, The soul that thus wou'd bravely dare to act, Tho' Reason doth discountenance the thought. MUTIUS. I bend submissive to superior sense; I own the senate's wisdom, yet am fix'd To act the darling purpose of my soul. 'Twas rashness, when of late Porsenna's arms Even to our city's gates our legions press'd, To see Horatius Cocles stand alone, And guard the passage of the Tiber's bridge 'Gainst conq'ring thousands of th'invading host. Firm as the bold Tarpeian rock he stood, And grimly smil'd upon a cloud of darts, As if his armour were impenetrable. The feeble planks, unable to sustain Accumulated weight, broke sudden down: Horatius, buckled in his massive mail, Still battled with the Tiber's yawning surge, And safely gain'd the city's walls. To this, Rome for a period her salvation ow'd: Then why should Mutius' act be madness deem'd; Why of success despair; since to the gods There's naught impossible? VALERIUS. The senate loves thee, and wou'd fain preserve, Not rashly sacrifice, so great a soul. MUTIUS. And wou'd the senate shew the love it bears, By barring Mutius from the path of fame? Wou'd they preserve him to be made a slave? Or die to-morrow like a sacrifice? If such be Roman love, then farewell Rome, Since, baby like, its children must be nurs'd, Nor suffer'd to exert the native fire That marshals them to glory. LUCRETIUS. Thou dauntless soul, go, gratify the thirst That rages in thy breast; and with thee bear The people's blessings and the senate's praise. MUTIUS. My gratitude's too full—I cannot speak The sum of thanks wherewith my bosom burns. (Kneels) But hear me swear, immortal gods above! Hear me, ye powers who watch the secret springs That animate thy lowly creature, Man! If any purpose but the cause of Rome; If any love, save that I bear my land, Thus urges me, may Mutius be a slave, And wear the bondage of eternal shame! Grant me, great Jove, the sun-defying eye Of thine imperial eagle, lest I fail, And wrongful fix my gaze! Give me, oh Mars, The brassy sinews of thy martial arm, That when I single out Porsenna's form, I plunge the weapon home. More I ask not; For I've a soul defying torture's pangs, When suff'ring for my country and its rights. (Rises.) LUCRETIUS. (descending from his seat, approaches Mutius). The senate's blessings and the people's pray'rs Attend thee, Mutius, in this bold exploit. I too will arm thee with a weapon tried, A blade corroded with the dearest blood Of Roman honor, Roman chastity. (Draws a dagger from beneath his robe.) This was the steel that pierc'd Lucretia's breast, The dagger that bereft my child of life, Which honor's loss made insupportable. I've worn it ever near this throbbing heart: It is the centinel that keeps awake The virtues that befit a Roman soul: Had they but drows'd, re-action should have lav'd Its blade incrusted in my recreant heart. (Presents it to Mutius.) On thee, the sacred weapon I bestow; Its pristine lustre ne'er will tarnish'd be By any act of Mutius. MUTIUS. It is a gift the gods themselves might boast: May Mutius prove he merited the trust!— Sage fathers of my country, now farewell! Till in the shades of peace we meet again, To tell of deeds that gain'd us bliss immortal. [Exit. VALERIUS. May gods propitious prove, and aid his cause! May Mutius to his country peace restore! LUCRETIUS. We'll to the temple, and by fervent prayer Endeavour to appease the wrath divine. Come, colleagues, Virtue's friends can never err! If we must die, none are so well prepar'd, As those who 'fore the altars yield their breath. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A room in Clelia's house. Enter Clelia and Attendant. CLELIA. The dire necessities which press the state Should rouze the Roman soul to energy. Distinction is no more: The great in deeds, The rich and low plebeian are as one— All nurtur'd by the self-same soil; all own The stock from which they sprung; and all alike Submissive bend before their country's gods. ATTENDANT. Porsenna's answer hath not tam'd their pride: E'en now our matrons pace the streets of Rome, And with their words re-animate our youth To face th'unequal numbers of the foe. CLELIA. Give orders that the portals of my house Be thrown wide open, to receive the throngs Of hungry and necessitous;—that all Partake alike the stores my father's gain'd. Who but the wealthy, in a time like this, Should yield their stock to save the public weal? To what but agriculture do we owe Those riches we possess? My granaries No more shall groan beneath the weight they bear: Distribute all I have: it sprung from earth, And cannot better be employ'd than now, To feed the hungry and distress'd. ATTENDANT. Borne on the wings of charity, I fly To make your gen'rous orders known. [Exit. CLELIA. But where's brave Mutius, conq'ror of my soul, Our senate's pride, the boast of Roman youths? Ah, why this weighty pressure at my heart? Is it derogatory to this breast To own itself enslav'd by such a man As noble Mutius? He hath confess'd, My virgin charms and dauntlessness of soul Have made him captive—Then love is noble; Or never wou'd its flame within his breast Have found a sanctuary!—What is love? In souls ignoble, a voluptuous fire; But in the virtuous heart, a glow as pure As that which graces Dian's frosty cheek, But never thaws her snowy chastity. Love is all virtue, honour, tenderness— A passion, when congenial, that exalts And rouses every dormant faculty To deeds that merit the bless'd gods applause. But see the hero comes. [Enter Mutius. MUTIUS. Clelia, thou wou'dst the wreath of honor crop, And leave no spray for Mutius. CLELIA. What means the valiant guardian of our state? MUTIUS. Each time I view thee, some new bud of fame Adorns the wreath of virgin modesty Wherewith thy brows are deck'd. The city rings, And Clelia's name swells on each passing breeze. For who but thou hast stay'd awhile the pangs Of threaten'd famine? Who but our Clelia Hath minister'd alike to every want, And rais'd in Rome the cry unanimous— Of laws, religion, liberty, or death. CLELIA. I merit no such praise—I give but that Which in prosperity were justly mine; But in a time like this, by right devolves, And is the common property of all. MUTIUS. 'Tis nobly said: e'en life is not our own, When Rome demands it. To save Rome's freedom, Thou'dst kiss the hostile hand that grasp'd the steel, And smiling, bare thy bosom to its point. CLELIA. I wou'd do all my country did demand, Or peril picture to my sense. I'd do What even Mutius wou'd not blush to own: I'd act as doth befit a Roman soul:— Mutius could do no more. MUTIUS. Thy words have sanction'd all my soul desires. Twin spirits animate alike our breasts— They burn with love of Rome and liberty. Thou know'st, my Clelia, how this heart adores Those radiant beauties which adorn thy mind: Thou know'st the ardour and the love I bear The altars of our gods—my country's rights. Then, first to merit Clelia's love, I'll act A deed that shall proclaim my love of Rome: I've sworn, and with the senate's sanction go, To slay this bold invader of our rights— To compass great Porsenna's death. CLELIA. The deed is hazardous, and death awaits Alike its failure or success. MUTIUS. Who but expects his death that doth attempt A mighty enterprise? Virtue consists In glory compass'd in the arms of death. I were indeed most covetous' of men, If, seeking fame, I wou'd attain my end, Without so small a sacrifice as life. CLELIA. Brave Mutius, I've a soul as proud as thine; A mind contemning all th'assaults of fate; A breast that's fir'd with all that love of fame, Which blazes forth in thee. I too possess A soul for pity, and a heart for love: Yes; coyness no more shall teach my tongue deceit; Clelia avows she hath a heart for thee. MUTIUS. Gods! have I merited this bounteous gift? Has any deed of Mutius gain'd him thus A bliss that gives him a foretaste of heav'n? CLELIA. Yes: Thine ev'ry act hath pav'd the way to fame; And such alone would have engraven love Upon the heart of Clelia. But, Mutius, Thou shalt be judge; yes, thou thyself confess, That I'm no selfish lover, nor would bar Thy way to glory and immortal praise.— Go:—Clelia bids thee seek for fame in death: Clelia, whose bosom owns love's ardent fire, Shall not retard thy course, nor stain her cheek With one disgraceful tear. Rather my heart Shall burst with aching, than confess its pangs: Rather I'd die a thousand, thousand deaths, Than make thy fame subservient to my love. MUTIUS. I stand amaz'd—a reverential awe More urges me to view thee as divine, Than being of this sublunary earth. CLELIA. Dispel the thought!—Remember that I love As well my country, Mutius, as thyself. Success or failure will alike augment My love of virtue and my love of thee. What if thou fall'st—we part but for a time, A transitory period—which expired, Shall waft me to those plains, where love like ours Will undiminish'd glow, when stars shall fade, And worlds and death itself shall be no more. MUTIUS. Be such our surety that we meet again, And meet to taste that everlasting joy, Which is the recompense of virtue here. CLELIA. Mutius, I seal my faith upon my heart. MUTIUS. And I seal mine in death. Clelia, thy hand; That I may press it with a soldier's lip, And thus attest a Roman's oath, and love. (Clelia giving her hand, Mutius kisses it.) CLELIA. Thus link'd in honor's bond, I'll lead thee forth, Till thro' Rome's portal thou hast safely past: Then with a blessing and a last adieu, I'll yield thee to that fate the gods ordain. [Exeunt. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Gates of Rome. Enter Mutius, disguised as an Etrurian; Clelia; with Soldiers, Plebeians, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. MUTIUS. Let me once more upon our city's gates The look of fondness bend.—Within those walls From prattling infancy was I uprear'd To boyish playfulness: my term of youth In sports was pass'd: but grown to manhood's state, I learnt those duties which adorn the man: I learnt to love my country and its laws; To curse the power of an usurping foe, And die to save the temples of our gods. CLELIA. And by these virtues hast thou gain'd applause From senators and people: thus repaid, Who would not be a virtuous Roman? MUTIUS. He's none, that would not act as Mutius doth.— Hear, oh my countrymen, ye sons of Rome, To you my parting words I would address: Let them strike deep into your noble minds, And firmer link the impenetrable mail Of virtuous courage that enshields your souls. From gods you sprung: they've henceforth guarded Rome— Rome, the common mother of us all. Jove, To try the steady fortitude of man, Will oft assail him with unlook'd for ills: For this, and this alone, he lowers on Rome. Think not he's heedless of our fate, my friends! He'll launch from heav'n his rattling thunders down, And fight the cause of justice and our land. Perils ere now have threat'ned: but the sage And rev'rend rulers that preside o'er Rome, Have stemm'd the boist'rous stood of fate, And still the common weal preserve. But now The meagre form of famine stalk'd in view, When meek-ey'd Charity, with balmy hand, Straight minist'red to all. Doubt not the gods; The virtuous ever meet the smiles of Jove. 1st PLEBEIAN. May heav'n befriend us, as we love the gods! 2nd PLEBEIAN. May Rome so prosper, as in her support Her citizens with one accord will die! CLELIA. Wou'd any, for these bold invaders' laws, Exchange his freedom, tho' 'tis coupled now With perils that assail on every side. ALL. We'll rather die. MUTIUS. Is there a wretch, whose sacrilegious hand Wou'd wrench from Liberty her even scale, Wou'd pluck from out the senate-house those men, Whose wisdom governs, and whose virtues save? ALL. We'll perish to preserve our laws. CLELIA. Then, on my life, the storehouse of the gods Will straight be open'd to supply your wants. Methinks already I behold the foe Driv'n from our fertile soil. Methinks I view The hardy labourer plenteously repaid; And bounteous produce of our mother earth Reward with golden harvest all our toils. MUTIUS. Be such your firm reliance on the gods, Be such your firm dependance on those men Who are the oracles of heav'n supreme. With me it rests to act what Fate decrees, To save, or die for, Rome and liberty! CLELIA. Farewell—for ever—Mutius—in this world. MUTIUS. To Rome, my countrymen, and Clelia too, Mutius now bids farewell.—Ye sacred powers, Whose will omnipotent must be obey'd, Look down with pity on my country's wrongs, And shield thy people from impending ills: Preserve those altars, 'fore whose sacred fires Our vows unceasingly were offer'd up: Preserve our freedom from the spoilers' chains; Preserve our rulers from a foreign yoke: Save them, oh save the soil of liberty— And if your will be so—oh grant that I Restore the blessings of tranquillity: Give peace to Rome and to my countrymen: But should I fail in this, still fire their hearts With love of all that constitutes life's bliss; Still grant them courage in the cause to die Of well-pois'd freedom and their ancient rights— Of that religion their forefathers own'd, And those sage rulers whom their choice approves. Sanction but this, ye powers, and Mutius dies— The friend of freedom, and the lov'd of gods. 1st PLEBEIAN. May Providence to Rome propitious prove, And send in safety its preserver back, That we may testify our soul's best love. ALL. Heav'n preserve our hero. CLELIA (retiring toward the gates). Once more farewell to Mutius! MUTIUS. The gods and liberty attend on Rome, As my fix'd love is Clelia's—in the grave. [Exit at the side. Clelia and Plebeians repass the gate. SCENE II. Interior view of a tent. LENTELLUS (solus). The faith of Manlius to his god and king My speech hath vainly strove to move. But now I've tented the young stripling to the soul: For tho' the gen'rous temper of his blood May urge for awhile to doubt the fraud, Yet there's in jealousy a secret sting That rankles at the heart unseen.—Silvia, By my command will straight attend me here. As to the youthful Junius first I'll speak, Allotting for the morrow's dawn some post Where perils imminent on ev'ry side Shall those await who there commence th'assault: Thus fear shall urge her to unsex herself, And for my mercy sue. This point attain'd, I'll grant her wishes, so her stubborn heart Forswear my rival, and receive my vows.— But yonder timidly behold she comes. Relentless fair one! know, the time is near When thou shalt sue to him who was thy slave. Enter Silvia, (with apparent timidity.) Throughout our camp the tongue of good report Proclaims aloud the feats of youthful Junius. SILVIA. Great sir, They wrong far nobler spirits, thus to praise A being so unworthy as myself. LENTELLUS. It is with virtuous courage always thus: The truly noble build their fame on deeds, Nor ever to the tongue of praise give ear. SILVIA. I wou'd I knew what actions thus have gain'd The mark'd attention of our sov'reign's friend? LENTELLUS. I will not pain a truly valiant breast By dwelling on its worthiness.—Be thou The sole proclaimer of thy glorious deeds. To-morrow gives to carnage and revenge The conquer'd sons of Rome. To thee a post Of peril and of honor I allot. There may the glory-thirsting Junius carve The way to victory and brow-deck'd fame. SILVIA (after a conflicting pause). So Manlius be my partner in the toil, I doubt not, gen'rous sir, to reap success. LENTELLUS. That must not be; already hath he gain'd The laurels which by right were Junius' due. Therefore have I so order'd it, that he A post remote from thine should occupy, That either of his merits may give proof. SILVIA (after an apparent violent struggle, replies with energy). Sir, to the utmost Junius shall maintain That praise which ill accords with his deserts. LENTELLUS (aside). By heavens, her wayward spirit foils my plan. (Addressing her.) Know'st thou, young man, how death in dread array Will compass thee on ev'ry side? Know'st thou The furious courage that impels the souls Of men to desperation driv'n? Then, think Of Roman hardihood to madness urg'd, And then confess if equal courage nerve Thy dawning manhood to attempt the feat. SILVIA (boldly). I know my spirit, but I doubt my pow'r: Still shall my fate avouch that I've a soul Defying danger, and contemning death. LENTELLUS. To-morrow's onset shall the truth avouch. SILVIA. Wou'd great Lentellus any further speech With one so much beholden to his praise? LENTELLUS (aside with passion). What must be done? shall she my purpose mar, And turn upon myself my plann'd intent? Fate wills that I should throw the mask aside, And act no longer in these borrow'd robes. She proves, 'tis true, superior to my arts; She shall not now be victor o'er my power. (Turning to Silvia, and after observing her attentively, advances, and seizes her hand.) Yes, youthful Junius, we must still confer: Such noble virtue must not 'scape so soon The prying eye of him who can discern A martial spirit in a female breast. SILVIA (confused). What means my chief? LENTELLUS. Think'st thou that Junius in these borrow'd robes Conceals the form of Silvia from my sight? Dost thou believe discernment in me sleeps, And that I know not Manlius for thy love? Short-sighted girl!—But I will work my end: His ruin shall avenge my slighted vows. Dost thou remember how I knelt, and sigh'd, And drew down pity from thy rev'rend sire, Who interceded for me, but in vain? Dost thou remember this, and still believe That with my love all vengeance too is fled? If such thy thoughts—thou know'st me not, proud maid! SILVIA. Thou wilt not stain thy soul, nor act a part So unbecoming great Porsenna's friend? LENTELLUS. To-morrow numbers Manlius with the dead, And makes thee mine for ever. Already The heart of him thou lov'st have I estrang'd: He thinks thee false, as Silvia and his friend. Thus doubly have I made my prey secure— He dies with the conviction of thy shame. SILVIA. Oh, despicable man! Think'st thou I'll live To be the wife of one so lost to shame? Think'st thou that Silvia wears this martial steel, And that her arm wou'd shrink in virtue's cause? Lentellus, thou hadst once my best esteem, But now inherit my eternal hate. Thou searst mine eyes, and to my sick'ning soul Thy voice sounds deadlier than the mandrake's groan. Thou'rt all my mind conceives of villany; And Death with all his terrors I'd caress, And think him Manlius, when compar'd with thee. LENTELLUS. This is but the momentary swell of pride; Lentellus heeds it not—'twill soon be hush'd: For violence of passion, as a storm More dreadful for the term, is soonest spent: This rage will all dissolve in sighs and tears. SILVIA. Never—Thy malice shall not swell my rage, Nor all thy deep-laid schemes draw forth one tear. Why shou'd I dread so base a wretch as thee? Are there not gods, and is not Heav'n just? Thou think'st to triumph in thy villany: But know, that even now thou art my slave, So weak is vice opposed by virtue's arm. LENTELLUS. Be such thy consolation then.—Without. Enter Etrurian Soldiers. In chains and bondage thou shalt wait my will. See this young traitor in the tent confin'd Which is allotted for Etruria's foes. SILVIA (disarmed by guard). Thy chains, thy bondage I alike despise, And smile at all which cowardice like thine Dare meditate to work its fell intent. Farewell, vain man! I leave thee to thy fate, And to that monitor which stirs within— Conscience—whose sting the gods on thee inflict. [Exit guarded. LENTELLUS. Insulting maid! thy words at length have rous'd Those passions which but waver'd in my breast. The doom of Manlius now is seal'd; and thou (When king Porsenna's seat I have attain'd) Shall be a base dependant on my will, And power compel thee to receive that love Which gentleness, with terms of honor join'd, Cou'd not enforce thee t'accept.—'Tis sworn; Just vengeance claims it, and shall be obey'd. [Exit. SCENE III. Part of the Etrurian Camp. Enter Guards with Silvia. SILVIA (addressing SERVIUS, the head guard). In pity hear me. SERVIUS. Young man I dare not: Our general's orders have forbid all speech. SILVIA. Is it not painful then to witness grief— To be the partner of thy captive's woe. SERVIUS. The soldier's duty never is a pain, Tho' fate omnipotent and worldly ills Encounter him on every side.—What then Save pleasure must the soldier feel, who thus In ignominious chains a wretch secures, Whose trait'rous soul cou'd harbour black intents, And war against a monarch just and good; A king protected by his country's laws; A king enthron'd in ev'ry subject's love? SILVIA. Next to the rev'rence I owe the gods, Is that I bear my king. To prove myself The champion of Porsenna and my land, I'd face the worst of ills, and smile at fate, That cou'd no tortures find to shake my love. —Oh! let thy reason own the voice of truth, Nor bar soft mercy's passage to thy soul. Give ear, my friend; and if my simple tale Move not thy breast to pity, and relieve, Then henceforth brand me with a traitor's name. GUARD. Thy prayers are vain: Our lives were forfeit did we dare comply; Therefore no more; but patient bear thy lot. SILVIA. It must be so—resign'd, I place my trust Where justice never sleeps. The eye of heav'n, Watchful, can read the very thought of guilt, And for a term o'er virtue give it sway, Till, dreadfully retributive, at once It blast the bloom of vice with virtue's beam, And bury all its glories in disgrace. Enter Manlius. MANLIUS. Just gods! and do I thus behold my friend? SILVIA. Then heav'n's propitious to its votary's pray'rs. Manlius! thy Silvia's true; thy friend sincere, Lentellus is a villain. MANLIUS. There's in thy words a charm that speaks them true: Give way, ye servile ministers of vice, Give freedom to the innocent, nor bar The course of ardent friendship such as mine. [Takes Silvia, and advances to the entrance of the tent, Guard intercepting him. SERVIUS. Dare not advance; for tho' we know thy worth, Yet as the traitor's friend we must regard That being who would intercept our course. MANLIUS (unsheathing his sword). Base wretch, no more. Enter Lentellus hastily, followed by Guards. LENTELLUS. Secure this new found traitor to the state, [Guards seize Manlius. Who boldly would the course of justice check, And free the partner of his villany. SILVIA. Oh, Manlius ador'd, my friend, my love, Not Junius, but thy Silvia, thou behold'st. LENTELLUS. Guards, away, bear him from my sight. [Silvia is borne off by Guard. MANLIUS. That voice, those words! delusion is no more. A thousand fancies rush upon my brain: It must be so. (Addressing Lentellus) Villain, thy base designs Stand naked to my view. I know thee now: Thy lavish'd praises were but wily snares; Thy proffer'd friendship and thy specious words So many lures to catch my thoughtless youth: But now I solve thy traitorous intent: The mystery's clear'd, and in his villain's garb Lentellus stands before me. LENTELLUS. Presumptuous boy! thou may'st awhile indulge This speech unbridled: for thy crimes ere long Shall seal thy tongue in ignominious death. MANLIUS. My soul defies thy threats: for all in vain Shall I be branded with a traitor's deeds, And die the victim of thy tyrant pow'r. My love, my Silvia, never will be thine: Her steady virtue will defy the shock Of malice, treachery, or brutal force: Her bosom beats in honor's sacred cause: She has a mind to prompt—a hand to act, Shou'd dire necessity demand the blow. LENTELLUS (sarcastically). What means this frantic rage? Is this the youth; Is this Etruria's friend, whose deeds in arms Shone forth conspicuous in his country's cause? Is this that Manlius whom Porsenna prais'd? The same that wrought upon my easy soul? MANLIUS. The same that was deceiv'd—but knows thee now: And, tho' in bondage, dares defy thy arts, And tell thee thou'rt a villain. LENTELLUS (to the guards, haughtily). Conduct the strippling traitor from my sight. Remote from the companion of his crimes, Let him in chains against his fortune rail, Till I in pity grant him an ignoble death. MANLIUS (contemptuously). I go; and with thee leave my soul's contempt. My bondage or my death with joy I greet, Since from thy fellowship I thus am freed. [Exit guarded. LENTELLUS. Why, so, my dearest wish is thus attain'd, And Manlius falls an easy prey. His breast, With friendly glow inspir'd, by force of arms Wou'd fain have rescued Silvia from the guard, Spurning the course of justice and his chief. For this bold act he dies; and Silvia thus, Of lover and of friend at once bereft, Becomes the victim of my arts. This night Our sev'ral chiefs within my tent will meet To plan the morrow's sackage of proud Rome. I'll then Porsenna's clemency dispraise, And shou'd I find them apt, in plainer terms The darling purpose of my soul unfold. I've sounded some more lowly in command, But they are all so bounden to their chiefs, That none without their sanction dare to act. Shou'd secret measures fail, this hand at least Shall rid me of Porsenna's hated life, And force enthrone me in his royal seat. I wou'd the time were come: for night decides By general sanction, or my sole resolve, The final doom of great Etruria's king. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Inside view of the Temple of Jupiter. A SOLEMN MARCH. Enter Valerius and Lucretius, the Consuls. Senators, Patricians, with lictors and fasces, &amp;c. The Priest of the Temple, Vestal Virgins, Roman Matrons, &amp;c. &amp;c. Chorus Singers, &amp;c. VALERIUS (advancing). With shouts of general praise he onward pass'd: Beside him, virgin Clelia stately walk'd, Whose brow, tho' stamp'd with beauty's signet, wore A look as dauntless as brave Mutius' self. LUCRETIUS. The gods attend the dangerous enterprise. Ours be the task to supplicate their aid, Or speedy terminate our lengthen'd woes. What if we fall? In honour's urn enclos'd Our mem'ries shall live while time endures— The theme of virtue and the hero's praise. Enter Clelia. CLELIA (addressing the senators). Health to the guardians of our country's rights, The bold defenders of Rome's liberty. VALERIUS. To Clelia welcome, in whose virgin form Sits magnanimity and honour thron'd. LUCRETIUS. The senate's thanks await the people's friend! Whose deeds of mercy, and whose virtues tried, Rank her to valiant Mutius next a-kin. CLELIA. The hero's gone—To Rome he bade adieu, And with his latest words great Jove implor'd To save his country, or its children nerve With patriot glow, that shou'd in death maintain Their firm allegiance to th'immortal gods, Their love of Rome, its freedom, and its rights. LUCRETIUS. Our actions shall attest the prayer was heard: We will not sully by disgraceful deeds, The gen'rous stock from which our Mutius sprung. CLELIA. One mind, one virtue, and one love of fame Be the inherent property of all: One bless'd religion animates our souls With thirst of never-failing bliss to come: One code of laws we boast, and those alone We will obey: one soil exuberant Its children hath maintain'd.—Thus are we one By nature, by religion, and our rights. Then let us unanimity display, And boast one spirit to support our land, And act like Mutius in our country's cause. LUCRETIUS. Senators, patricians, people, are agreed No other gods, nor laws we will obey; 'Tis Rome and honor, liberty or death. CLELIA. Fathers, the eye of heav'n is bent on Rome. E'en now perhaps the gods in conclave sit, Determining the crisis of our fate. Let us before their sacred altars bow: The bold in virtue are the meek in pray'r. THE PRIEST OF JUPITER. Parent of all, by all confess'd Of space the mighty Lord, Whose mercy succours the distress'd, Whose power's by all ador'd. GRAND CHORUS. From Heav'n's high throne thy rattling thunders send, Dismay the foe, thy people's rights defend. VESTAL VIRGINS. Father of peace, eternal Sire, Award the threat'ning fate; Enshield thy vot'ries vestal fire, Preserve the Roman state. GRAND CHORUS. So shall our fervent notes thy praise proclaim! So shall we bend before thy hallow'd name. SINGLE MALE VOICE, TENOR. Oh, source of justice, guard the just; Save those who place in thee their trust; Crown val'rous cause with victory, Mutius with immortality. GRAND CHORUS. Crown val'rous cause with victory, Mutius with immortality. SAME VOICE. Oh, may'st thou sanction his intent, And prove him on thy mission sent; So shall he reap the victory, And merit immortality. GRAND CHORUS. So shall he reap the victory, And merit immortality. PRIEST (base voice). Oh, boundless spirit, at whose dreadful nod All nature trembling owns thee for its God. Oh scepter'd monarch of the air, Supremely good, divinely fair, Behold thy people, succour their distress, Thine arm can conquer, and thy smile can bless. GRAND CHORUS. Jove immortal, just and good, In heav'n, on earth, in fire and flood, Let thine hand repel the wave, And the bark of freedom save. Grant that Rome's expiring breath Call for libety or death. (Curtain falls.) SCENE II. Part of the Etrurian Camp. Enter Porsenna, Etrurian Officers, Guard, &amp;c. PORSENNA. Our chief Lentellus will attend me straight. OFFICER. Your message known, my liege, he bade me say He'd on the instant speed him to your tent. PORSENNA. Are all my legions there assembled? OFFICER. I heard but now the trumpet shrilly sound: It was the signal for their march. PORSENNA. I'll thither to receive my hardy troops; Their brave deserts well merit all the praise Their monarch can bestow. [Exeunt. Enter Silvia. SILVIA. Thus far have I escap'd unseen—But, ah! What rising terrors now o'ercome my mind, And with a chilly terror strike my frame: Methinks the perturbation of my breast Hath led my steps astray. On ev'ry side The trumpet's clangor thrills my inmost soul, And busy hum of marching legions sound, Increasing more my mind's timidity: I know not whither to direct my course; My fears for Manlius quite o'ercome my heart, And my sunk spirits now proclaim the woman. Enter Lentellus. Protect me, gods! LENTELLUS (with astonishment). My captive freed!—where is the traitor guard, Whose boldness dare his chieftain disobey? For this the villain dies. SILVIA. Thy soldier to his trust was true: 'twas I My freedom thus obtain'd. LENTELLUS. Cou'd thy weak hands the fetters disunite, Wherewith thy limbs were manacled? Silvia, Thy words unmann'd the guardian of thy trust. And thou, proud maid— SILVIA. Do with me as thou wilt: be death my lot, But save, oh, spare the vet'ran soldier's life: Be all thy vengeance mine; thy mercy his. LENTELLUS. Instruct me how to pity, and I'll save. SILVIA (kneeling). Then let me touch thee with my fervent pray'rs; Let me thus supplicate, till vengeance sleep, And godlike mercy teach thee how to feel. LENTELLUS. Silvia, for thee the soldier stak'd his life: Be just thyself: his ransom now depends On thy resolve—Be mine, and he shall live: If still obdurate to my wish—he dies. SILVIA. Be merciful, Lentellus. LENTELLUS. As thou can'st pity, even so will I. Enter Mutius in the back ground, stops on seeing Lentellus. MUTIUS. It must be so—I trac'd Porsenna's steps: Hither he bent his course, and this is he. SILVIA. Save him, proud chief, nor slur thy martial deeds With cruelty. LENTELLUS. Swear to be mine— SILVIA. The fate's decreed; I ne'er can plight my vows: Yet still be merciful, dread chief in arms, Whose power alike can pardon as condemn. MUTIUS. That title hath at once his rank proclaim'd; My sword shall aid this suppliant's cause, and Rome's. (Draws his sword and advances.) LENTELLUS. I'll hear no more—force shall compel thee. (Lentellus advances to Silvia, who rises from her prostrate position, and flies him— When on the point of pursuing her, Lentellus is intercepted by Mutius.) MUTIUS. Dare not advance; thou art the scourge of Rome, And now a Roman arm defies thee. LENTELLUS. Presumptuous wretch! who, and what art thou? MUTIUS. Thy deadly foe, whose life I come to seek; To save the freedom of my countrymen. LENTELLUS. Base wretch! give way, nor dare thine hand upraise. Know'st thou my dignity? MUTIUS. Too well I know thee: but of words enough: Oppose thy weapon to my trusty sword, Or as a coward I will strike thee dead. LENTELLUS. My voice might legions summon to my aid: But I despise the coward thought. Though base, I will myself this insolence chastise, And lay thee, villain, with thy kindred dust. MUTIUS. Now, for our gods, our rights, and liberty. (They fight obstinately; Lentellus at length disarms Mutius, and is about to sacrifice him to his rage, when Mutius rushes on him, and, with the dagger given him by Lucretius, stabs him, exclaiming,) Die, Porsenna; and by a Roman hand. [Lentellus falls, groans, and dies. Be thine, ye gods, the noble sacrifice; May Rome be sav'd, and Mutius dies content! (Silvia, during the encounter, is nearly overpowered by contending emotions of hope and fear; but seeing Lentellus fall, and the dagger in Mutius' hand, advances towards him.) MUTIUS. Young man, seek safety in thy flight: nor thus In trembling wait the lot which must be thine, If here discovered with the man, whose hand Hath wrought this mighty overthrow. (While Silvia endeavours to regain her scattered spirits, enter Etrurian Guard, with Manlius and Servius, their prisoners; on beholding them, Silvia shrieks, and is instantly seized.) OFFICER (amazed). Comrades, behold, our chieftain's slain. 2D GUARD. What stranger's this, whose murd'rous hand still grasps The reeking badge of death? MUTIUS. A Roman; One who can vaunt the dreadful wreck he's made, And laugh at that which must requite the act— Your tortures practis'd on his mortal part. OFFICER. Know'st thou the victim of thy bloody deed? MUTIUS. Porsenna was the man whose life I sought; Whose death gives freedom to my native land. GUARD. Perfidious villain! but, the gods be prais'd, Who frustrated the dire attempt. He lives— Porsenna lives—Lentellus bleeds before thee. MUTIUS. Lentellus! My shame o'erpowers me; I sicken at the sight— Welcome, thou steel! thus to my recreant heart. (Endeavours to stab himself, is prevented by Guard, who disarm and seize him.) GUARD. Come, let's conduct these traitors 'fore the king: See that our chief Lentellus be convey'd, And with all honors plac'd within his tent. [Exeunt—Mutius marching with folded arms, in sullen dignity. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Inside view of Porsenna's Tent— who is seated on an elevated throne; numerous Guards, &amp;c. ranged round, and a large tripod before the king in the centre of the stage, in which is placed a blazing fire. PORSENNA. Your toils, my valiant soldiers, well demand Your leader's plaudits and your country's love. At length the final doom of Rome's decreed, And soon with victory crown'd, and rich with spoils, Your mother land shall witness your return. Then, scarf'd in gentle peace, your warlike toils, With wives', with mothers', and with virgin's loves Shall be repaid. To-morrow is the day, The fatal morn that lights to sacrifice Proud Rome, its freedom, and its citizens. Yet, comrades, suffer not unmanly rage To stain with brutal vengeance all your deeds. Remember, that your enemies are brave; That Romans only have maintain'd their rights, All fall defending what yourselves preserve, Their laws, their liberty, and native soil. Enter Guards, with Mutius, Manlius, Silvia, and Servius, guarded. PORSENNA. Speak! Why are these men disarm'd thus brought before me? I thought our camp had been from bondsmen free, And that Etruria was not thus disgraced By soldiers who could swerve from duty. OFFICER. Most royal sir, if so it please you hear, I will in brief the circumstance relate Which thus hath forced me in your gracious sight. PORSENNA. Proceed!— OFFICER. Some hours are pass'd, since for a trait'rous act Against yourself contriv'd, (of which our chief Lentellus was assur'd,) young Manlius here, And Junius, partner of the base design, Were both by his command in fetters bound, And to each captive was a guard assign'd. But Servius straight, unmindful of his chief, Free'd Junius from his fetters, and anon Speeds him to Manlius' tent, where force achiev'd Alike his liberation. Already With hasty step they sought to 'scape the camp, But I, appriz'd, pursued, and both were ta'en. As hitherward I led them back, behold Junius the renegade was seiz'd, with whom This traitor villain to the state was found. His hand a reeking dagger bore, all badg'd With blood of brave Lentellus, who lay stretch'd Dead at the murd'rer's feet.—I question'd him— When, lo, he vaunted the accursed blow Aim'd at your life, my liege; which by mistake Inflicted was upon our chief Lentellus. Thus far, my Lord, I know; and thus was urg'd Into your royal presence. PORSENNA. I do commend thy diligence—Now, speak; What dire injustice hath Porsenna done, That should have prompted thus your trait'rous minds To compass his destruction? MANLIUS. My leige, In vindication of myself and friend, And this good honest soldier too, I'll speak; But for this stranger I can naught advance, Whose person and intents are both alike To us unknown. PORSENNA. Manlius, I've known thy loyalty and truth, Thy courage tried in dauntless feats of arms. This charge against thee, therefore, pains me more Than words can well express. Be thine the task To solve the doubts that crowd upon my mind, And prove thee worthy of my former love. MANLIUS. My honour'd lord! Thus simply runs the purport of my tale: One beauteous maid Lentullus' love inspir'd; Silvia—the offspring of bold Tullus' blood! But she our chief refus'd, and fix'd on me The gracious eye of kind preferment. Still to be firmer rooted in her heart, I foremost offer'd to oppose the foe, And march'd into the field. Meanwhile the maid, Misdoubting of the fate which might befall Myself, th'unworthy object of her care, In manly garments 'ray'd, the army join'd, Where soon, unknown, she did become my friend, And shar'd each anxious thought that swell'd my breast. Of this, by stealth, our chieftain was appriz'd, Whose slighted love, rekindling at the thought, Brooded on dire revenge. He first assay'd To shake the loyalty I bear my king: Th'attempt being fruitless, next by jealousy He sought to compass his design. But firm In the assurance of my mistress' faith, I heeded not the slander. Anon he strove By arts to win my Silvia to his will. This proving vain, our chief, to madness urg'd, Lest she the secret should disclose, then seiz'd And as a traitor led the maid away; In whose defence I drew, as for my friend: For the which deed myself was also ta'en, As partner in the crime. Such was the tale By Silvia told, which won this honest man To stir against Lentullus' villany. Lo, here, my liege, stands Silvia in your sight, By all esteem'd, and by myself rever'd, As youthful Junius, partner of my toils. PORSENNA. Thy simple tale doth well approve its truth, And certify Lentellus' black designs. To Silvia, Manlius, and my vet'ran guard Give instant freedom.—(All released.) Addressing Silvia. Thy worthy parent, gentle maid, still lives In my remembrance; and, 'spite of this disguise, In thee the lineaments of Tullus' child, Oft view'd before, again do I recall, And know thee well for virgin Silvia. For this thy true love shewn, be henceforth bride To Manlius, well deserving such deserts. (To Servius.) On thee, old man, whose life was freely risk'd Supporting innocence and justice' cause, My bounty shall be shower'd. (To Silvia.) Yet, gentle maid, Whate'er thou know'st of this same stranger here, Whose daring hand thy base oppressor struck, Thyself being present—prithee, now unfold, SILVIA. Most gracious sire; with many fears oppress'd For Manlius' safety, and this gen'rous guard, I bent my trembling steps to 'scape unseen Without the limits of the camp—when, lo, Lentellus cross'd my way—in vain I sued; He threat'ned instant death to this old man, If still obdurate I refus'd his love. Still mercy was my plea, till rage at length To brutal force the chief impell'd—I fled; When straight this unknown youth appear'd. Converse Awhile they held; but with my fears oppress'd, I heeded not the sum of their discourse, And from my dread awoke, but to behold The cause of all my terrors stretch'd in death. PORSENNA. 'Tis well: The gods have haply thus his crimes repaid: Now, stranger, speak: what purpose sway'd thy soul, Thus boldly to enact this deed of death. MUTIUS. I struck for Rome and liberty. PORSENNA. Whence art thou, and thy name? MUTIUS. Prais'd be the gods! in Rome I first inhal'd The breath of freedom and of life—My name Is Mutius—Roman Mutius, thy sworn foe. PORSENNA. What act against thyself, thy kin, or friend, Hath in thee rous'd such hate inveterate? MUTIUS. Thou art my country's scourge—the bane of Rome. PORSENNA. Wou'd not thy legions, crown'd with victory, Prove as oppressive to Etruria's race? MUTIUS. And if 'twere so, I trust Etruria boasts A man like me, that for his native rights Wou'd be a voluntary sacrifice. PORSENNA. How wou'dst thou have sav'd thy country and thy friends? MUTIUS. By plunging in thy breast the self-same steel That drank Lentellus' blood. I freely swore, And with the senate's blessings hither came To work my purpose, and contented die. Yet think not, chief, this ignominious hand Shall 'scape the recompense its failure claims. (Gradually advances to the tripod, and raising his hand, thrusts it into the fire, looking with dauntless mien upon the astonished prince.) Thus let it crumble in the scorching flames— Perish the foul dishonor—that these eyes Be never blasted with its hated form. And thou, great chief, by this example learn How I regard thy punishments severe, Which on my mortal frame shall be inflict. Proud chief, a Roman soul knows how to act, And how to suffer—Myself am not alone The only person henceforth thou must fear. Three hundred Roman youths like me conspired, And will accomplish your destruction. Therefore prepare for their attempts.—No dread, No show of anguish shall my mien display, But thus your utmost torments I'll defy: Nor writhe a limb, nor blanch my quiv'ring cheek; But still exulting in my country's cause, Die worthy Rome, myself, and liberty. (During this speech, Mutius bends his eye stedfastly upon. Porsenna, who, together with every one present, observe him in wondering admiration—Mutius, on concluding, withdraws his hand, and wraps it in the folds of his garment. PORSENNA. Brave Mutius! I never was in magnanimity outdone: My death was thine intent—The blow was foil'd, Yet has thine heroism gain'd the cause Which fail'd in action: Mutius, freedom's thine, And for thy valour, still shalt thou maintain Thy gods, thy liberty, and ancient rights. Porsenna grants the senate's terms—gives peace: 'Tis Mutius saves his country and his friends. [Porsenna descends from his throne, and advances to Mutius. MUTIUS. Thy deeds my admiration oft inspir'd: But now this act magnanimous displays A godlike spirit in a mortal breast. Be thou, great chief, for ever lov'd of Rome, For in its walls there breathes not one who boasts A mind more noble, or a soul more just. PORSENNA. Mutius, live henceforth in Porsenna's breast; Thy virtue claims unrivalled my esteem. MUTIUS. Most noble chief; To merit thy mind's praise shall forthwith be The pride of Mutius and the boast of Rome. PORSENNA (to one of his Officers). Dispatch mine herald to the city's gates: Bid him the senate greet with friendly words: Bid him proclaim how Mutius sav'd the state, And gain'd Porsenna's everlasting love: Tell them, their conq'ror now becomes their friend; That virtuous magnanimity transform'd The thirst of vengeance to sweet amity— The deadly steel into the olive bough. Bid him announce the hero's quick return, And that ourself escorts him on the way. [Exit Officer. (To Mutius.) Yes, dauntless youth, with thee I'll straight proceed, And ratify the terms of lasting peace;— My nobles all, brave Manlius and his love, Shall be the witness of thy kindred's joy, And Rome's reception of its valiant son. MUTIUS. I lack smooth words of compliment, to show How much I am beholden to your praise. Yet, brave Porsenna, be assur'd of this: My tongue, whene'er it dwells on virtue's theme, Shall 'title thee the hero of my tale. PORSENNA. Mutius, I crave no more; To be approv'd of such a man as thee, O'ertops the sum of my deserts. But come, Sound forth each instrument of war—sound loud— That, swelling on the breeze, the martial strain Give signal to the senate of our march. [Exeunt all—Mutius marching beside Porsenna. SCENE II. and last. The gates of Rome. Enter in procession through the gates. Valerius and Lucretius, Senators, Clelia bearing a wreath of oak, Vestal Virgins, Patricians, Soldiers, Plebeians, &amp;c. From the side of the stage, enter Guards, followed by Porsenna, Mutius, Manlius, Silvia, Servius, &amp;c. grand march playing while arranging round the stage. Mutius' arm in a sling. PORSENNA. Guardians of Rome, defenders of its rights, Behold the saviour of your native land. In Mutius, view the youth whose virtue gain'd Porsenna's plaudits and your nation's peace. LUCRETIUS. Rome's senators and citizens divide 'Twixt thee, great king, and Mutius, their applause. Thy gen'rous clemency—his patriot zeal— Thy love of virtue and his dauntless deeds, Claim equally our wonder and our praise. MUTIUS. A thousand joys are center'd in this breast, Nor know I how to give them utterance. I feel a reverential glow, and own The deed was none of mine, but heav'n's—Once more Our rights, our temples, and our city's free: Once more I'm welcom'd by my kindred's smiles, And virgin Clelia's love: The senate too Requites my action with its thanks. And here, In majesty array'd, do I behold The friend of virtue and the friend of Rome. VALERIUS. The senate and the people welcome back Their brother, champion, and preserver. LUCRETIUS. And in memorial of the sacrifice, To Mutius henceforth be the title join'd Of Scævola, that so in times to come Thy children, by inheriting the name, May learn to emulate their sires bold deeds. From Clelia too receive the oak-bound wreath: It is the hero's due, and therefore thine— By valor thine, brave Mutius Scævola. CLELIA (advancing—MUTIUS bends on one knee). Mutius, my soul's with exultation fir'd. Again to view thee—and to view thee thus, With more than mortal pleasure glads my heart— Receive the recompense to valour due: Thus Clelia crowns thee with the badge of fame— The wreath, whose verdure time can never blight— Whose bloom shall live the rudest storms of fate, And still transmit thy memory—to be The theme of virtue and the hero's boast. MUTIUS (rising). Virtue ne'er thirsts for praise to come—'tis here: I feel th'immortal glow now fill my soul— Virtue rewards itself.—Yet, Clelia, say, Canst thou behold thy Mutius as before? Look on this scarf, whose folds enclose that arm Which oft was rear'd in Rome's defence—but now Is motionless for ever. CLELIA. Can Mutius stain me with a doubtful thought? Can he, whose honor-crested brow displays The soul magnanimous, thus question me? Think'st thou the body's sears can taint my mind? It is the soul's dishonor Clelia loathes; And such a wound will ne'er be Scævola's. Hadst thou been all one mangled form of blood; Had gashes so thy martial front disguis'd, That lineaments were scarce discernible; Still wou'd I glory in thee, so thy mind Were not polluted by dishonor's touch. Oh, Mutius! think not but in times to come, There will be heroes to defend their land— Heroes like thee—that, in their country's cause, Will forfeit thus a limb; and deem the loss The body's lasting badge of ornament. MUTIUS. It is my glory, since in Clelia's eyes The token is acceptable. PORSENNA. The union of twin souls like these must prove Worthy the admiration of the gods. First in the senate shall be ratified The lasting peace which Rome to Mutius owes. Then twofold nuptials shall the altar grace; Give Clelia to her martial Scævola, Our Manlius to his Silvia.—This done, Let Romans and Etrurians joyful meet; Let festive mirth on ev'ry side proclaim The sweets of amity, the joys of peace. MANLIUS. To offer praises adequate, great sire, To goodness so transcendant, were but vain; Be mine the task by loyalty to prove That I have merited your gracious smiles. SILVIA. If in your sight I have found grace, my liege, Let me be blotted from the line I boast, Be deem'd an alien to brave Tullus' blood, Whene'er in thought or action I forget That love and duty which by right are yours. CLELIA. Great chief; Receive my heart's o'erflowing gratitude. Thy clemency has sav'd my country's rights, And render'd back the hero of my soul. PORSENNA. Who'd ride to victory through seas of blood? 'Tis clemency alone can touch the heart, And link contending souls in amity. MUTIUS. Romans have prov'd they'll die to save their rights. Be ours henceforth the task, great chief, to learn, From thy example, how to feel the woes By fate inflicted on our enemies. Come, Clelia, to the gods we'll offer praise: They guard the valiant and protect the just. Therefore let Roman virtue henceforth prove That Rome is worthy of the gods bless'd love: Let's stamp each Roman breast bright virtue's home, And friends of virtue will be friends to Rome. THE END OF THE PLAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. WRITTEN BY A FRIEND. OUR Play concluded, where's the heart of steel That would not die to save our public weal? Shew me the man whose ardor would not prove, That like a Mutius he would act and love. I see our hero stamp'd on ev'ry face, And British dames array'd in Clelia's grace. To the Upper Gallery: But homage first unto the gods be given; I mean the thundering host in yonder heav'n. What do I see? the sons of Neptune brave— They need not speak; they've prov'd they'll die to save: France, Spain, and Denmark can attest 'tis true, And give each tar the praise to Mutius due. To the first Gallery: Beneath, a strange assortment I behold, Whose industry supplies the realm with gold: They to maintain the state would gladly die, And gain like Mutius immortality. To the Boxes: But now I'm dazzled, as around I gaze, Such grace, such beauty fill me with amaze: No simp'ring now, no languishing is here; Each front displays a bold contempt of fear; Each seems to boast a Clelia in her breast, And pluck a spray from glory's budding crest. Beside them, fathers, husbands, sons, are seen, While Roman energy arrays each mien. The reverend sage, by his forefathers taught, By wisdom still maintains the rights he bought: The father, willing, yields his store to save, And snatches poverty from out the grave: The youths, by their example, burn to show, That rising Britons own the Roman glow. Such is the scene: I gaze upon the book— I read bright virtue in each British look. To the Pit: But soft! a throng sedate I now address, Whose mighty pow'r e'en Mutius doth confess; With whom the critic and the man of wit, From times remote, was always used to sit. (Pauses, and looks round.) Good heav'ns! how strange! the wonted scene is fled: Then Mutius lives—since criticism's dead. Oh, spare me, for I fly to ease the pain; Revive our bard, nor let him hope in vain. Ye gods! in mercy thunder forth your praise— 'Twill Mutius' spirits and your author's raise.</field>
