      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS PRIMUS. Enter Count, Horatio solus. Hor. Diuine inuention, O how I could hug, And like an amorous Louer court thy beauty, That crownst me King of pleasures: were my braine Fordg'd out of vulgar metall without fier, And sprightly motion, my big-swolne hopes, Had bene still-borne, but when deiected minds, Out slept the golden pleasure of the night: My serious meditations haue out-watch'd, The glorious tapers that attend the Moone: I turnd my thoughts into a thousand shapes: Moulded the fashion of ten thousand plots, Lik'd and dislik'd so many, that my brayne The mother of Inuention grew barrayne, Almost past bearing, still my laboring thoughts Conceiu'd a yet more strange and quaint Idea, Gaue it proportion, and I brought it forth: And that blest infant of Inuention Beyond all hope hath my contentment woon, And that's Loues heauen I loue a face more faire Then Cintheas hue that seems aboue compare, But hell, her husband with a iealous eye Vshers her steps, oh wedded slauery! This tender rose, whom artles marriage, Hath grafted on a nettle (testy age) Haue I vngrafted, made himselfe vntie The knot of wedlock: thanks sweete industrie. Enter Count Lurdo. meditating. And here a comes, that which most heaps my fame, His wit's well spoken of. Lu. This wit's a sprightly thing. Ho. For such as haue't. Lu. It not alone doth bring, Publique applause, but knowledge i'the law, Teacheth to speake in distance. Ho. How the daw Scoures ore his rustie phrases? honord Count, How growes your plot? Lu. My thriuing fortunes mount Aboue suppose, euen to my harts content: Wee are diuorc'd. Ho. My hopes are preualent. Lu. You know the cause on't, two sufficient men Swore her a harlot, and the partiall Bench Inspirde by my good Angels (Angels wings Sweepe a cleare passage to the seat of Kings) Seald our diuorce. Ho. But doth her brother swallow This grosse abuse? Lu. Abuse, away, away. They know me rich Horatio, chinke, chinke: Whilst this holds out, my cause shal neuer sincke. Enter Duke Ferneze and Angelo. Ho. See where a comes, his sad complexion weares, Griefs mourning liuery, he is clothde in teares. Ang. Whence springs this sorrow? Fer. For my sisters shame, My sister, oh my sister, whose repute Hung like a Iewell on her sexes forehead. Ang. And what of her? Fer. Shee is, o no she was Pure as the Diamond, cleere as christall glasse, But now, O hell, her credit is more foule, Then speckled scandall, or black murders soule. Ang. I cannot thinke it. Lu. But I know't too true, She was my wife and by her meanes, my head Was fayrely tupt and you will buy a Lanthorne: Bespeake my sconce, tis ready hornd and all. Ho. Not yet, but Ile take order that it shall. Fer. And are yee parted? Lu. What a question's that? Shall I weare crackt rings, Diamonds with a flaw, Ile carry coles and you wil, no hornes, I know the law. An. Is this your griefe? Fer. This is inough, to make Patience turne ruffin, she that was the paterne, To whose proportion all our courtly dames, Cut out their actions, she to fall: a signeâ Lu. More will fall shortly. Fer. Her shameâ Lu. Growes here, who euer broacht the wyne, The butt stands here, my forehead bears the signe, Ho. It merrits none, the shame's nor yours nor his, That foot's euen made that neuer treads a misse, Beauty came first from Heauen, Prometheus, Stole it to make proud women bewteous, Now, stolne goods thriue not: women steale from men Then blame not them to seeke their owne agen. Kings haue for this bene felons, and tis prou'd, He neuer was diuine that neuer lou'd. Lu. I finde no law for this. Ho. Custome you proue, And what's more Auncient then to pilfer loue? Lu. A quillet well applide. Ho. Then bury griefe, Yf this be fellonie, my self's a theife. Lu. A nimble witte, iust of the length of mine, But come my leidge, forget it so will I, Our infant griefs must be old men and die, Fer. Not whilst hir fault suruiues, What newes with thee. Enter Horatio's Page. Pa. I bring your honor comfortable newes, Your sonne's return'd from Pisa, Fer. A comes ill, And yet I hope his blest arriue will kill This monster griefe. Ho. He is a toward Prince. Fe. Toward inough, and yet most strangely wean'd And wedded from this worlds societie. Lu. A parlous youth, sharpe and sattyricall, Would a but spend some study in the law, A would proue a passing subtle Barrister. Hor. Ha's a quick wit. Lur. And a speakes Latin too, Truely and so few Lawyers vse to doe. Enter Prince Polymetes with a Booke. Poly. Health to this honour'd presence: passing good! Ang. Welcome sweet Prince. Poly. Thanks: superpassing good! But honord father, see how he proceedes: Learning was first made pilot to the world, And in the chaire of contemplation, Many degrees aboue the turning cloudes Held in his hand the nine-leaf'd marble booke, Drawne full of siluer lines and golden Stars. Fer. But Sonne? Poly. But father, it was learnings place, Till emptie outsides, shadowes daub'd with golde Pluckt him downe headlong, then alost his wits, And euer since liues Zany to the world, Turnes Pageant-Poet, toyler to the presse, Makes himselfe cheape, detested, hist and stale, To euerie bubble and dull Groome. Who for his out-sides gawdie, will presume To make poore wit a hackney to his pride. And with blunt rowled Iestes spur-gall his side Till his soule bleede, O, I am more then mad, To see meere shadowes censure and controule, The substance, worthier both in sence and soule Fer. Fie Polymetes, though the robe of learning, Sit comely on a Prince, yet weane thy thoughts From this strict contemplation, and embrace Publique assemblies, knightly exercise. Poly. How's that? to sweare and giue the sunden stab? Sell Lands to purchase fashions? O tis base! Bought gentrie, should true-borne worth disgrace. Ang. Practise to hunt. Pol. No, some that vse that sport Giu't ore, being scarce one haire the better for't. Fer. Then practise Reuels. Pol. Reuels sprightly play. Yet euerie yeare, some reuell all away. Lur. All these are triuiall: Prince, be a Lawyer: Pol. Of all Land monsters, some that beare that name, Might well be sparde, whose vultur Auarice Deuours men liuing: they of all the rest, Deale most with Angells, &amp; yet proue least blest. Lur. Wrong not the Law. Pol. I cannot, tis diuine: And ile compare it to a golden chaine, That linkes the body of a common-wealth, Into a firme and formall Vnion. It holds the sword, with an impartiall hand, Curbs in the raines of an vnruly land, Tis twin'd to Iustice, and with holy zeale, Rightly determines the poore mans appeale. And those that are lawes true administers, Are fathers to the wrong'd, heauen's Iusticers. Lur. Fore-god tis true, right properties of the Law But vnder fauour, and with due respect Of that vnualued perle, and the professors, Your selfe and such lacke-Latin Aduocates Infect the heart, and doe their best to change The true intent of sanctimonious law. Turne Churchyards Champions, and make the ground growne rancke with Grandsires flesh, Beare corne to feed the Sonne. Fer. Will this be suffer'd? But Polymetes, in thy stay at Pisa, When heardst thou of thy Sister? Pol. Much to late, The reason, with your patience ile relate. Beautious Emilia, whome I neuer saw, But in the Rhethorique of discoursiue tongues In Sancta Monta, neighbour to Sardinia, Where siluer Arno in her Christall bosome, Courts the fresh bancks with many an amorous kisse. My Sister (as the countrie custome claim'd) With all the choycest virgins of the Land, Met at the Temple halfe a league remote, From all resort of people, which was deck'd With all the Reliques, and the choicest Iemmes, Marcellis, Pisa, or Ligorne could yeeld. Fer. What follow'd this rich preparation? Pol. Whilst they securely tend their Orizons, Three armed Gallies of the faithlesse Turkes, At this aduantage set their men on shore, Enterd the Temple, and prophande their shrines, On the high Altar sacrifiz'd the Priests, Disray'd the Temple of the golden robes, Murder'd the matrons, rauished the Maides, And dragging them by the disheueld haire, Did with their rauish'd bodies fill their boates, Amongst the rest, Emilia whome report Cald by no name but onely beautifull, Was rauish'd, slaine, or taken prisoner. Fer. O Polymetes! thy discourse confounds, Thou healst old hurts, yet giu'st vs deeper wounds, But words are ayre, see our arm'd Gallies man'd, And in them place as many of our Knights As lou'd Emilia and their Soueraignes health. Ile vnto Pisa, and till our returne, Because our widowed Duke-dome shall not mourne. Be thou her minion, and possesse her chaire, Fill that with honour, t'will fill thee with care, Vrge no denialls, Genowaes a dew, Wee leaue old greefes, and goe in quest of new. Exeunt: manent Lurdo and Horatio. Lur. Better and better, now my hopes are fit, The Duke thus gone, what tongue so bold dares say I wrong'd my wife? Ho. That dares Horatioes. Lur. Thou art my self, we both haue but one bosome One tongue, one soule, two bodies &amp; one heart. Hor. I know't my Lord. Lur. Tis true, but let that passe, Wee two are one. Hor. I know your honour's wise. Lur. And I know thee For no small foole, twa's simple pollicie, And not without some counsel of the lawe, That not withstanding my wiues neere allyance Vnto the Duke, I purchac'd a diuorce. Hor. What was the cause? Lur. I tell thee, the moste wrong Was this, my Auarice thought she liu'd too long. I know one man hath coffind vp sixe wiues Since she was mine, and by the poorest, purst A brace of thousand pounds: still good in Law, Men must be rich, by thrift our treasures rise, Giue me the man's knaue rich, take you poore wise, But close, cocke sure ile feed me fat with sport, Gull all, foole all, why? I haue Law-tricks for't. Exit Hor. How Iustice Slender glories in the plot, Which to deceiue him, my full braine begot? But to his wife, true vertue though disgrac'd, Shee's now halfe woo'd because shee's thought vnchast Her sexes credit, or discredit thriues In th'outward shape and fashion of their liues, and be a womans vertues nere so strong, Her honour's weighed vpon discourses tongue. Be her same sullied, were her thoughts as bright As Innocence, the world would count her light. For though mongst women, moste are beautious, They that please time are counted vertuous, And in this hope, ile to the Countesse goe, Shee's counted light, Loue grant I finde her so. Exit. Enter Emilia and Ioculo. Joc. Welcome to Genoa Madam, and to make a short cut of our long trauell, faith tell mee, how doe you feele your selfe since you came a shore? Em. Feele my selfe? why with my hands, what an idle question's that? Ioc. Then pray bee you better occupied in your answere: but Madam, doe you remember what a multitude of fishes we saw at Sea? and I doe wonder how they can all liue by one another. Em. Why foole, as men do on the Land, the great ones eate vp the little ones, but Ioculo, I am great, passing great, and readie to lye downe. Joc. Doe Madam, and ile stand by and doe my good will to deliuer you. Em. Mans death of what? Ioc. Why of your Maiden-head Madam &amp; if you please, or rather of the huge birth of knauerie y'are in trauell of. Em. And in sooth Ioculo at this time I stand in some need of a wittie Mid-wif: but may I trust thee? Ioc. Aboue the girdle-stead, and below the knee Madam without any danger, why Madam, you know at our first meeting in the Turkes Gallies, where we were both prisoners, and in a manner str?gers, I rested faithful when we counterfeited ourselues lunaticke to escape their furie I proued not false when wee were cast naked a shore: I stood firme to you, and neuer since left your companyes now hauing had these tryals of me abroade, neuer mistrust my secrecie at home. Em. I wil credit thee, and now receiue this embrion of knauerie, brieflie as I deliuer it. I vnderstand since our priuate arriuall heere at Genoa, that the Duke my father hearing of my surprisal from Montasancta, attended with a hundred Knights, is gone to seeke a needle in a bottle of Hay. Io. Or rather to catch a quicke Eele by theâ Em. Teeth, as I haue done you sir? Io. Nay, and you breake iestes a my teeth once, I haue done with you. Em. If the breaking of the iest kept your teeth whole, twas well broken: but to the purpose; as well to trie what mettle our Genowaies wits are made of, as also to put my Brothers humor to the test, I intend to dance a prettie change with my name (for by nothing else I am sure they can knowe me, being in my infancie carried to my Aunts at Pisa) then insteed of Emilia, call me Tristella. Io. Agreed, but what man i'th mist is this? Em. I know not yet, lets walke, and take occasion to confer with them. Enter Polymetes reading, and Iulio taking Tobacco. Ioc. Yet keep without eye-shot so long as you can. Poly. O moste Diuine! Iul. Tobacco? the best in Europe, 't cost mee ten Crownes an ounce by this vapor. Pol. Art not asham'd? Iul. Of your foppish humor? yes by this Element villanously asham'd, pox on't, leaue it, you are a scholler, goe but to antiquitie, reade the Chronicles, you may finde some of your Ancestors chronicled for winning a Wenches fauour for loosing their armour, but few for wit and Schollership: Souldiers &amp; Scollers could neuer set their horses together, especially in this kicking age: but who comes heere? one she-Satyre or other to pitch vp her Tent, cast downe her gauntlet and proclaime thee coward for not stabbing her, when shee gaue thee the moste plaine apparant and open lye. Em. Ioculo, we are fallen into their eyes. Ioc. Theile hardly see their way then, for we are shrew'd moats, but al's one, ile giue occasion of quarreil, answert you as you can. iustle Iulio. Iul. Your reason Sir? Ioc. To make thee recoile, or with the Souldier to fall off, i'st your countrie manner to corriue a leader, being vpon or before present seruice as I am? Iul. Pardon me sir, I did not see your charge. Would I had neuer seene her, for her eye Hath set my thoughts in a strange mutenie. Pol. What, in loue Iulio? Iul. No Prince, loue's in me, I like a slaue indure loues tyrannie. Ioc. Madam, your Brother. Pol. Slaue to all slaues be he that snares his eye, In a weake Syrens Cob-web flatterie. Iul. God saue faire sweete. Em. Amen, from such as you. Iul. You had said for such, had your tongue gone true. Em. Why then belike I lye. Iul. I would you did, within my Curtens. Em. Marry loue forbid. Iul. Nay, loue is willing, for he cries lets goe: Em. Then loue hath two tunges, for he tels me no, so pray let's part. Iul. What, and our lips not meete? Em. Now fie vpon't, like Broom-men in the street? Y'are a young wooer, or else much to rude, To shew this kindnesse fore a multitude, But by the blush that colours ore your face, You would scarce doo't in a more priuate place. Po. This same str?ge thing i'th likenes of a wom?, Tastes of much wit, though I not loue her sex, Ile arme my thoughts to cracke a iest with her. What, graueld Iulio? Em. No, but run a Land: Is your wits shipping any better mand? Pol. Yes, will you board it? Em. No, I dare not venter: Pol. Make but a shot in iest and you may enter. Em. You are a Scholler. Pol. I haue seene some Schooles. Em. You came not ore i'the last fleet of Fooles. Pol. You tooke my roome vp. Em. I pray tak't agen, Weele haue no women fooles saile amongst men. Pol. Your wit's much currish. Em. Why't bites not you, It feedes on fooles flesh, so wise men adieu Iul. Please you accept the curtsie of the towne? Em. I need not, I haue curtsies of mine owne: ther's one for you. Pol. How chance your wit's so free? Em. Onely to out-goe Iadish company. Iul. Here are none such. Ioc. Take heede, for if you tire, Sheele keepe her pace and leaue you in the mire. Pol. A womans feature, but a Schollers tongue In quick discourse, Philosophers nere wondred More at the strange conception of the windes, Then I admire how she attain'd this wit: Did not true learning make the soule diuine, She hath spoke enough to make me conuertine. Iul. My loues are sound, &amp; wait but your reply, A short lin'd accent, either no or I. Em. I am not too seueare, nor yet so kinde, To fall for euerie idle puff of winde. But farwell, ile take counsell of my pillow, Pittie fresh youth should wither in greene willowe. Iul. Appoint the place sweete, ile not misse mine houre. Em. At the three fooles. Iul. Ile meete. Em. And make vp foure. Pol. Sweet wordes, kinde lookes, what? and a parting kisse. Words, lookes and lips crie all, the wenche is his. I am possest deuill, loue perswades my minde, That if to him, to me shee'le proue more kinde. What's Iulio made of? hadst thou soule or sence, Thou wouldst not prentise thy affections, Nor tie thy fortunes to a strangers loue. Iul. A little liking my Lord, a ierk a trick or so, but no pure loue I protest, but be impartiall, cast of the furd-gowne of hate, and speake out of the naked Doublet and hose of iudgement: is she not worthy to be beloued? nay, might not she and I liue passing well together? Pol. Yes, if to liue in bondage be no hell, I thinke you two, might doe exceeding well. Iul. Well my Lord, because ile bee no example of selfe-will, ile breake off our meeting at the three Fooles, and send for her to Court, where ile put al my loue into one quart of Maligo, &amp; your melancholly humor into another, and he that hath done last, shall for penance giue her a kicke a the lips, and a pipe of Tobacco be my witnesse, that's all the loue I beare her. Pol. Well Iulio, How ere you iuggle, if you doe agree, You must be pleas'd to weare the keepers fee. Exeunt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Count Lurdo and Adam. Adam. Sir, I doe not loue to double with a wom? if my friend, much lesse with you my most vpright &amp; straight Count, my yong Lord (as I told you) is turnd absolute prodigall. Lur. How prodigall? Adam. Marry thus prodigall, to frequent ordinaries is his ordinarie practise, rubs out whole weekes together in bowling. Allyes, bandies away his pocket full of French-Crownes in a morning, and counts it a prettie sport to procure heate. Lur. Thou telst me wonders, he that but last day, Was neuer seene to walke without a booke, Writ against pleasure, and make bitter iests Of honest recreation, turn'd dissolute, I see no reason for't, the law and I, (I tell you plainely Adam) thinke you lye. Adam. Thinke as you will sir, there's not a tricke vsde in the towne that deserues damnation, but hee desires to deale in't, tis pitty a was not made a tradesman, he loves to follow his occupation a life, &amp; that which makes him doubt most, he is in loue with the Indian punck Tobacco. Lur. Punke! how the foole that doth not know it slaunders a leafe, nick-names a stranger herb. Adam. No herb a grace I hope sir. Lur. Nor good thrift neither, Yet theres one dunce, a kinde of plodding Poet, Sweare's twas not in the first creation, Because he findes no ballad argument, To proue old Adam a Tobacconiste. Adam. I thinke none a the name loue's it, I haue heard olde Adam was an honest man, and a good Gardiner lou'd Lettice well, Sallets and Cabbage reasonable well, yet no Tobacco: Again, Adam Bell a substantial out-law, &amp; passing a good Archer, yet no Tobaconist. Further, Diogenes, whose propper name might bee Adam for ought I know, lou'd Carretts well, Leeke porredge passing well, yet no Tobacco: to conclude, my great Grandfathers Grandfathers father, and my selfe all Gardners, yet could not abide this Chimney-sweeper Tobacco. Lur. They did not: take me with you, what's the cause, They were al plaine folks, &amp; did not know the lawes. Adam. They were plaine indeede, and thereof grew the prouerbe, plaine dealing is a Iewell. Lur. But he that vseth it shall die a begger. Ad. That addition was made by some Lawyer or Poet, to auoid which, they cannot indure plaine-dealing should haue a hand in any of their actions. Lu. Touch no mans functi?, there are ierks &amp; tricks Spurne not the law, for if you doe, it kicks. Ad. So will a spur-gald Iade sir, but to all these misdemeanors, a maintaines a priuate punck, one Tristella that hee had in way of reuersion from Iulio, a twindger, a meere Horsleach, one that will suck out the braines of his treasurie, and make a meere skin of his wealth, I, out of my Loue reprehended his error, and he in a furie kick't me out of dores, and discharged me of his seruice. Lu. I like not this, tis neither right nor streight done with no law-trick, nor no good conceite, but here a comes. Enter Polim. &amp; Emilia. Ad. With Autumne in his bosome, pray God she shake not downe his leaues, and leaue him to make the Duke his father a bald reckoning. Lu. Peace and obserue. Em. Though I be a stranger to you, Yet am I well acquainted with your humor. A Lady cannot liue about the Court Without the enuie of your Epigrams, If she be pleasant, she is counted light, If ruddy, painted, if her ruffes be thicke, They aske much poaking. Po. Trust me, loue hath kild That worme-wood humor, bring th'authoritie Of one true tongue to proue my poesie, Euer wrong'd woman. Em. And you'l doo't agen? Lur. That's a good wench. Em. I pray who ought that pen? That in a stammering Iambick vaine, Glanc'd at Emiliaes loose and gaudie traine. And broke broad iests vpon her narrow heele, Poak't her Rebatoes, and suruaid her steele, tide her fring'd garters, bought her words by weight Lur. Still good in law, and an vpright conceit. Em. Doe you not know that man? Pol. Suppose I doe? Em. You did but flout them, and youle flout me too You wondred not Cornelia being so faire, Would be beholding to her Laundresse haire. Pol. I know not this. Em. True, nor that Florymell, Became a Pages habit passing well, Vsde single Rapier, tooke the rouse and swore, Of all land Beasts she could not brooke the Bore, Nor that Count Lurdo, comming to a fray, Brought not the worth of one poore haire away. Pol. More then his owne. Lur. That iest comes neere to me, Tis out-growne now, a wants authoritie. Em. Nor that Melina whom your Muse renownes Wore out as many suiters as new gownes. And the same day that she was marryed, Vpon her finger wore her maiden-head. In likenes of a Dyamond. Pol. Indeede twa's sed, That for Ring Melina sold her head. Em. But y'are all Ouids. Lur. They are bawdie mates, Touch Lawyers too, indeed abuse all states, Em. Poets are wanton, and no doubt inioy, Their faire Corynnes, though perhaps lesse coy. Pol. Suppose some doe? Em. Each one in this agrees to scandall vs. Lur. And talke of Lawyers fees. Pol. Graunt me but loue, &amp; with my vtmost power, I will defend your sexes stainlesse honour: And with my pen dipt in the iuice of gall, Be his soules terror, that hereafter shall, Cast ynke at honours garments, or aspire To name your sex with an vnhallowed fire. Em. I take your word. Enter Iulio. Poly. Then seale it with a kisse. Lur. That kisse my Lord deserues an Epigram. Pol. Sit downe good Vncle. Lur. An vnbidden guest Should bring a stoole along. Poly. A womans iest. Iul. You meane a lye, for women vse to lye. Em. But not like Schollers by authoritie. Jul. Yet they may produce lying authoritie, and so cannot Poets. Lur. Nor Lawyers neither. Em. Are you a Lawyer? Jul. Ifaith Madam, he hath sit on the skirts of law any time this thirtie yeares. Ad. Then he should bee a good Trencher-man by his profession. Lu. Your reason Adam. Ad. I knew one of that facultie in one terme eate vp a hole Towne, Church, Steeple and all. Iu. I wonder the Bels rung not all in in his belly. Ad. No sir, he solde them to buy his wife a Taffety Gowne, and himselfe a veluet Iacket. Po. What a prou'd Iacke was that? but I wonder at Lawyers for one thing, many of them vse to take their fees afore-hand. Em. For a two-folde pollicy, one is they were commonly greedie, the other for feare if their Clyents follow their Counsell long, they will not be worth a fee. Lau. Tis well said Lady, you doe well to iest with an olde man. Ad. A saies true, for if you shold iest too much with a young man, it might proue earnest, &amp; so the fruites of your ieasts make you both a sham'd on't. Pol. Well said Adam, but leauing at a full iest, Vncle, what earnest businesse brought you hither? Lur. Your honours sudden Metamorphosis, Tolde by your trustie Seruant, and confirmd By publique rumor. Pol. Why what saies Goody Fame, and my trustie Seruant Lu. This is the worst my Lord that you expend Your treasure on that Ladies maintenance. Pol. S'foot say I doe, what, has the worme-eaten bawd Fame: or ere a pander-like foole else to doe with it? giue her maintenance, why she is of my nere affinitie, should I see my shee affinitie goe in tatters? I allow my Seruant rags, &amp; I were worse then a Iew, if I should suffer my shee affinitie to goe naked. Lu. Law takes your part, &amp; if your pursse grow short Rather then spend the publique treasurie, Ile lend your Grace a brace of thousand pounds, Prouided this, that as our Booke-men write I haue securitie. Em. A Lawyer right? Pol. Securitie? Leases and old rents, Castles and Towne-ships, able men, good securitie, Townes are no Starters, theile hold out winde and weather. Lu. I craue no more, let me haue pawnes and vse. Em. How? Lords turne Vsurers? those that should punnish brokeage deale vppon pawnes? If it were once his owne, Hee'de lend him mony on his Duke-domes crowne Po. But faith Vncle tell me, what think you of this Lady? would she not make a prettie peart Dutches? Lur. Shee's faire, nor do I discommend your choise I wish her your's, a priuate friend or so, I know mad Ierks, and know that Lawe allowes, Princes their priuate pleasures, and my selfe Will doe my best to gaine your honours loue, I will not absolutely say there are, But there may be, if so your honour please, Sellers and Vaults, which from your priuate Garden May vnder ground lead to your bed-chamber. Whither, I will not name my selfe, but some close friend, May vnsuspected bring your beautious Lady. Em. Lord what a broaking Aduocate is this? He was some Squiers Scriuenor, and hath scrapt Gentilitie out of Atturneys fees: His bastard actions proue him such a one, For true worth scornes to turne Camelion. Pol. Madam, my Vncle out of tender-loue, Better to shun all scandalous suspect, That might attend on our vnsuiting loues Will lodge you at his house, whither at turnesâ Em. Your Grace may haue accesse. Lur. Tis so indeede. Em. Is there a backe way? Lur. And a priuate doore, A secret vault, and twentie odde tricks more. Em. A Stoue? Lur. And Arbors with sweete violet Beds, That haue bin prest to death with maiden-heads, Where you may sport and breath, and take a rouse Em. Perdy, this Lawyer keepes a bawdie house, I shall be ready to deceiue you all. My Lord, your Law-plot's, most iudiciall. Enter the Countesse. But who comes heere? some one of your cast clyents. Iul. Gods me, the Countesse. Lur. Mum, I cannot stay, There's a clowd rising, driues my Sun away. Em. Is this your wife? Lur. Madam, tis she that was. Em. That was and is not? how comes that to passe? Count. I cannot tell, God &amp; his conscience knowes Lur. And the world sees Colossus on my browes, Hercules Pillers, here's non vltra writ. Iul. Not in brasse Characters? Pol. No, hornes more fit. Lur. Hath not the Lawe diuorc'd and made a bar twixt our affections? wert not thou content to take a pention? Coun. Which you still detaine. Lur. Good wit, Law-trickes and firme, you may complaine. Cou. Complaine I doe, I kneele before the throane and sue for Iustice, but yet can purchase none. Complaine I doe Cousen. Pol. Away. Cou. O, as you are a Prince, and you a virgin. Em. I was one long since, This is no place for passion, drie your eyes, Cou. Greife nailes me to the ground, I cannot rise, Ile grow immodest, iustice is exild, And so shall duetie, patience turne wilde, Po. Come, leaue the Bedlam. Enter Horatio a side. Lu.

The man talkes idely, tell me I am faire, Louely and young. Hor.

In thy smooth chin there is an Iuorie pit, Where blushing Uenus and young Cupid sit, Feathering of golden shafts, the wounding heads, Made of thy amber-tresses finest threds. Co. You will not buy me sure you praise me so. Hor. Yet faire, ile bid faire for you ere I goe, Co. He that bids faire for me deceiues his eye. Hor. By heauen a doth not. Enter Horatios Page. Co.

Hart, a new fashion, A Lady poore, beautifull and chast? cleane From the bias of Custome: to be poore, painted, And proud is as c?mon in Genoa, as felt and feather In the fortunate Iland: but chast and poore, As singuler and rare, as Conscience with the Ana-baptist. Cou. Come hether Boy, didst neuer owe me seruice Pag. Yes Madam, more then euer I paid you honestly, and were a not my Maister. Cou. Thy Maister, who? Pa.

And what resort? Pag. Verie ciuil and moste quiet resort, patients, the house is set round with patients twice or thrice a day, and because theile be sure not to want drinke, euerie one brings his owne water in an Vrinall with him. Cou. Doth a vse phisicke too? that's beyond his warrant. Pa. O Lord Madam, better men then hee straine curtesie with their warrants in this age, besides, you being musicall, shall meet much content, for my mother lodges three or foure Knights &amp; Ladies Daughters that practise musicke and needle-work, and wil no doubt be exceeding proud of your company, wilt please you walke?

My hopes are buried. Enter count Lurdo againe. Lur. My conceited braine, Hath an odde crotchet call'd me backe againe. Hor. To all these bad mis-fortunes should the Count vse any trickes? Lur.

Suppose he tell the Duke he gaue the poison. Hor. He contriu'd her death, and cannot wrong me, Lur. Fie, I feare him not, He doth but father, what my braine begot. Exit. Ho. This comfort yet which many want I haue, To follow my faire fortunes to the graue. Exit</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS QUINTUS. Enter Horatio's Page With a Theeues Lanthorne. Page. Oh, shall I venter? ha, shall I enter? Shield me Appollo, the gro?d it so hollow That euerie step I treade vpon it, Methinkes it sings a dead mans Sonnet. Fates, oh Fates be honest Drabs, Feare giues me ten thousand stabs, I dare not further tis wilfull murther, Thus late to treade the cloyster vaults. For though i'me small, I haue great mens faults, Then gentle Fates, take some remorse, I watch an honest, kinde, quick course. Graunt that no Hobgoblins fright me, No hungrie deuils rise vp and bite me: No Vrchin, Elues, or drunkards Ghoasts, Shoue me against walles or postes, O graunt I may no black thing touch, Though many men loue to meete such. But heere's the tombe, my hopes suffizing, I watch a daintie Duckes vprising, Her cheekes now are chilly, as is the pale lilly, But when her eye vncloses, theile looke like two faire Roses Enter Horatio with a light. A light my maister? or some spright, Yet What neede Deuils haue candle-light, Tis he, all hid, ile not be seene, For once this tombe shall be my screene. He hides himselfe. Hor. I cannot rest, my guilt keepes ope mine eyes. My passion rips my bosome, and my blood Is turn'd to poysoned water, and so swels, That my vext soule, endures a thousand hels. If I chance slumber, then I dreame of Serpents, Toades, altogether, and such venomous euils, As hale me from my sleepe like forked Deuils, Midnight, thou Ãthiope, Empresse of black soules, Thou general Bawde to the whole world, I salute thee, Wishing thy poison dropt vpon my braine, For my so rude, so rash, so heedeles murther, In the ambition &amp; the height of lust, Not giuing my blood libertie to coole. To poison such a beautie, O black Fate! Thus many killd, too soone repent too late. Soft, stay, this sames the chilly monument, That huggs her bodie in his marble armes. Thou gentle soule of my deceased loue; O, wert but possible to inioy thy voice, Thy sweet Harmonious voice, I should be blest, But Eene to dally with thy silables, O tombe. Pa. No tombe but Cesterne fild with teares. Ho. O heart! Pa. No heart, but sinke of greefe and feares. Hor. Countesse, soule shaddow, shadow speak again. Pa. Speake agen. Ho. What should I speake, my hate, or thy huge wrongs? Pa. Hudge wrongs. Hor. Hudge wrongs indeede, but charitable soule, What ransome shall I pay thee for thy life? Pa. Thy life. Ho. My life? Pa. I, I life. Ho. Discourteous ayre, My blood is frozen with dispaire. Pag. Dispaire. Hor. Pardon forgiue me, shall I goe? Pa. I goe. Hor. But shall your hate pursue me, I or no? Pa. No. Hor. Adieu my greefe and ile go sleepe. Pa. Pray God my tongue can my hearts co?sel keep Pa. Ha? are you vanisht? let me see, a may be fallen a sleepe against some pillar, for ile be sworn a talk'd verie idely, Abiit decessit euasit erupit, I would fain know that Wag that can put me down for a womans Ghoast extempore, especially if it were to be performde vnder a tombe cloath, but heere lay the desperate venter, had she chaunc'd to haue risen, and spoke before hir qu, as about this time she must tise, or my sleepie drinke plaies, the drowsie companion with her. Enter Horatio againe. Hart a me, my maister againe, what crosse points are these? I see I must betake me to my late refuge. Hor. It was no Ghoast, subtile opinion, Working in mans decayed faculties, Cuts out and shapes illusiue fantasies, And our weak apprehensions like wax, Receiue the frome, and presently conuey Vnto our dull immagination. And hereupon we ground a thousand lyes, As that we see Deuils ratling their chaines, Goastes of dead men, varietie of spirits, When our owne guiltie conscience is the hell. and our black thoughts, the Cauerns where they dwel: Yet sure this was her shadow, for I heare Her last words sound still dauncing in mine eare. Then gentle soule, if thou beest yet vnthronde, Answere one question and no more. Pa, No more? Hor. May my hearts true repentance satisfie, My wilfull, murther, your replie. Pa. I. Ho. Thanks, thousand and thanks, and so farewell. Po. Farewell. Ho. The bane of murder is dispaire and hell. Exit. Pa. Was euer poore little knaue put to his last trumps as I am? what shall I do now; my heart goes pit a pat in my belly like a paire of washing beetles, should a returne again now, as my hand to a Lobster-pye a will, all the Fat were in the fier, but harke tis one a clock, and iust about this minute she should play the wagtaile and stur. Count. What trance was this? where am I? Pa. Oh she speaks, Fates and be good girles keepe my maister away, and let his man haue a little sport with his mistresse. Count. What place is this? am I in heauen or no. Pa. No. Count. What voice is that? is this place earth? Pa. Earth. Count. Earth? how came I hither? do I liue again? Pa. Liue again. Count. What voice is that? a woman or some youth? Pa. Youth. Count. My feares will murther me, my powers are frighted. Pa. Ahlas poore stirring ghost art ouer sprighted. Count. Boy. Pa. mestresse. Count. Tell mee. Pa. all and more anon. The sleepy drink hath plaid the honest man, Cou. What sleepy drink? how came I in this tombe? Pa. Ile tell you that in a more priuate roome, Away Ile tell you a strange wonder, Then wintes lightning, or Christmas thunder, Then to my fathers trip and go, Nimble preuention ont runs woe. Exeunt. Enter Ferneze the Duke, Count, Lurdo, Angelo, Horatio and Adam with others atendant. Du. No more of mourning brother, we haue laid Our timelesse sorrowes in a quiet graue, When men interre their comfort let them weepe: Not when their crying charme is laide to sleepe. Lu. Great Duke mine eyes are not thus great with teares, For our griefes funerall, but that her shame, And future scandall will out liue her name, Du. Come let mirth kill it, and to your discourse, Is our sonne growne vnto that height of riot Your speeches intimate. Lu. Your highnest knowes, I know the law, if I haue wrongd the Prince, I stand in compas of a prÃ¦monire, And he by writte of ad quod dampuum may, sue his recouery, I know the law. Du. Nay his owne letter partly graunts asmuch, But note his subtle reason, here a writs, That of set purpose a laid by himselfe, And plaid the parte of a wilde prodigall, Onely to put your loue vnto the test, On which aduantage to igrese his wealth, You did indeare him to society, Of carelesse wantons and light Curtezans, Made secret vaults and cellers vnder ground. Lu. Non tenet in bocardo I demurre, Do but send out your Iterum summoneas, Or capias vt legatum to attach, And bring him viua voce tongue to tongue, And vi &amp; armis Ile reuenge this wrong. Du. Leaue that to triall, here a further writtes, That by his skill and practize in black Art, He hath found out and by much toile redeemd, My daughter from the Turkish seruitude. Lo. Redeemde your daughter! an apparent error, Which you by way of melius inquerendum. May soone discuse, he ransome home your daughter As sure as I made cellers vnder ground, Or playd his pandar. Du. How so ere it proue, I meane to try the vtmost of his wit, To see how quaintly he can beare himselfe: But who comes here. Enter Emilia. Ad. Marry my good Lord, this is the greene bur, that stuck so close to the young Princes sleeue, the shoemakers cutting knife, that fitted his boots to the prodigalls last. Lo. If I be Compos mentis, this is shee, Must play your daughters part, my Lord beware, Worke close cock sure, I se the gin the snare. Em. Most reuerend father. Lo. Father? now it fits, Ware an olde Fox, Duke I haue braynes I haue wits. Du. Immodest impudent and shameles girle, Is't not enough thou hast mis-led my sonne, And wrong his reputation? Em. How wrongd him father? I must needs say I haue playd Will with the wispe with my brother and haue led him vp and downe the maze of good fellowship, till I haue made his wit and his wealth both turne sick but for any other wrong, I appeale to himselfe, my vncle honest Iulios where is a? and all the rest of this good Audience, therefore pray good father. Du. Out of my sight, thou art no childe of myne, Em. Y'are the more beholding to some of your neighbours, tut m? looke on mee well, here's your nowne nose, and thick kissing lip vp and downe, and my mother were liuing, she would neuer busse you more, till you confest I were your daughter. Du. What an audatious naughty pack is this? Haue her before a Iustice, Adam. Em. Do, with all my heart good father, send mee to a Iustice, for a pretty woman with a smooth tongue and an Angel's voice, can do much with Iustice in this golden age, but thus much afore I go, if Iustice will not prouide me a better father, Ile haue you, or Ile giue the beadle of the ward a fee to cry, a new father a new, as they do oysters at Callais. Exit. Du. Brother cre you acquainted with this woman? Lo. I must needs say that at my nephews suite, I gaue her a months lodging and her diet. But Nuda veritate in bare truth, &amp; bona fide without circumstance, Splendeuse Sole the bright Sun nere sawe, A wench more capable of wit and law, And how soere she is with bewty grac'd, I dare engage myne honor she is chast, Du. I giue your words good credit, yet tis rare, to finde a woman wanton, chast and fayre, But now vnto my sonne, whose powerfull art, Striues to vngiue his sisters seruitude. Polimetes in his study. Pol. Thanks He eate, thou hast insphearde my hope In a golde circle, o were my father here, This fight would of his age bate twenty yeare. Du. What sight my sonne. Po. Lend mee your watry eye, That swims in passion for my sisters losse, And in this booke prospectiue, let it read, A pleasing lecture. Du. I conceiue two shapes. A ciuill marchant and a bewteous mayd. Their pace is speedy and my slower eye, Cannot keepe way with their celerity. Po. That maid's my sister, whome on magiques wing, To this fayre presence, my rich Art shall bring, Prepare to meete them, for this minutes age, sends with my charme their airy pilgrimage. Enter Iulio like a Marchant, and Ioculo like a Lady. Iu. Whereare are we now? how strangely were we borne Vpon the pinions of the fleeting ayre, And where dismounted? vnto what great Prince Christian or Pagan longs this mansion. Io. Are we in any sociable place? Or in the Cell of some Magitian, Who by his skill in hellish exorcismes, Made vs his thrall? Du. I can forbeare no longer, Welcome thrice wellcome. Iu. Welcome? Io. Whence? Iu. To whome? Du. To mee. Ang. to vs. Du. Thy father. Lu. and thy friendes. Io. do not beguile vs, O Demetrio? We are betraid, see the Magtiian, That by his cunning and strong working charmes, Brought vs vnknowne. Du.

Thy Brothers Arte all further difference endes. Io. Your Citty. Du. Genoa. Io. And your reuerend name. Duk. Ferneze. Io. Father. Lur. Yes the verie same, I doe remember when she went to nurse, What a curst vixen twa's, but now shee's growne. Io.

Lay by discourse, what Gentleman is that comes vninuited to our feast of ioy. Ioc. Pray welcome him father, hee's a Genoan marchant, that with much suite ransom'd mee from the Turke. Duk. My hopes redeemer welcome, but proceede Vnto the doubtfull fortunes of my childe: Twas tolde me she was stolne from Monta sancta. Iul. You helpe my memorie, thence she was stolne, And for her beautie, chosen Concubine To the lasciuious Turke, but by much sute, And meditation of some speciall friends, I bought her freedome with a thousand markes. Duk. Which weele repay with ample interest, Once more weele bid you welcome, and to set A smoother glosse vpon our merryment, There's a quicke Wench that onely liues by wit, Who vnderstanding I had lost my Daughter, Borrow'd thy habit, and Vsurpes thy name, One call her in, now Daughter make thee fit, To combat and dismount her actiue wit. Exit. Adam Lur. A parlous Girle, her wits a meere Snaphaunce, Goe's with a fire locke, she strikes fire from stones, Shee knowes the Law too, a meere murthering peece, Fight lowe, locke close, shee speakes meere, lightning Neece. Enter Adam with Emilia. Em. How now father, haue you put on your c?sidering Cap, and bethought you? or shall I proceede and trauerse my writ of errors? Lur. Ha, writ of errors? Law-trickes, words of Art Demurrs and quillets. Em. All not worth a pinne, will you bethinke you father? Du.

The like of me commaund, Now I coniure thee by the loue You beare Dianaes silent Groue, By Cupids bowe, and golden arrow, Venus Doue, and chirping Sparrow, By all those vowes, the listning windes, Heare when Maides vnclaspe their mindes. By those sweete oathes men vse in bed, Beseeging of a Maiden head. I doe coniure you fore these Lords, To answere truely to my words. Io. By these and more, by all the scapes Of amorous Ioue and PhÅbus rapes, By Louers sweet, and secret meetings, Hand embracings and lip-greetings, I promise you before these Lords, To answere truely to your words.
