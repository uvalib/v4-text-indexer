      <field name="fulltext">THE WEDDING RING. A DRAMATIC SCENE. The old ballad of The Berkshire Lady, which recounts an adventure that actually happened above a century ago to one of the most respectable families in that county, is the origin of the following drama. The names and localities that I have chosen are of course fictitious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Sir Edward Delmont. Arthur Delmont, his brother. The Lady Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, a magnificent Saloon in the house of the Lady Stanley near Reading.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sir Edward Delmont, and Arthur. Sir Edward. Why thus amort, fair brother? 'Tis a rich And princely hall, a palace-like demesne. Seest thou yon stately oaks and those old thorns, The growth of centuries, mingling their gay wreaths Of pearly blossoms with the weeping spray Of the light feathery birch, and darker shoots Of shining holly, while amidst the fern The dappled deer lie couching? Art thou master Of this fair seat? Arthur. I'faith I know not. Sir Edward. 'Twas A gay and glittering coach, drawn by four mares Of the right Flanders breed, conveyed us hither; And she our fair companion mistress seemed Of that proud equipageâthe nameless she! Arthur. Not wholly nameless,âMary;âthe good priest Told us so far. Sir Edward. And in so telling told Full little. Mary! commonest of sounds. Name of all wear! So doth the lordly Earl, So the poor cobbler call his wife; the princess Within her stately bower, and the coarse drudge That milks her kine, both answer to that name. 'Tis general as the violet, now lurking Beneath the white-thorn hedge, now proudly placed I' the garden's southern nook beside the rose. She's Mary Delmont now. Dost shrink to hear Those words conjoined? Arthur. Not I. Sir Edward. Yet thou art sad And silent, brother mine; thy cheek is pale, Thy fiery glance is quenched, and thy smooth brow Contracted into lines of wrinkling care Fitter for me thine elder; though I grant ye The chances of this morning might perplex Even my ripe wisdom. Wilt thou hear them? First To abide a challenge at the rapier point, The cause and challenge unknown; and then Having with some small painâfor true men love not To fight with shadows and for shadows!âhaving Roused thy hot valour to that Quixote strain, To find thy puissant adversary changed To a fair damsel, who doth give thee choice 'Twixt two sharp hazards, wedlock or the sword; To marry in a mask, thou know'st not whom; To come home with thy bride thou know'st not where; And when safe lodged within this goodly chamber The bride to disappear thou know'st not how; Whilst at short intervals come grinning knaves, On thriftless errands bent, to trim the hearth Or close the casement, and young tittering girls Thrust giggling faces through half open doors, And if we ask who brought us here? or where We be, unlucky?âgroom and maid burst forth Into ungoverned laughter and so vanish. Say I not sooth? Arthur. 'Tis over true. Sir Edward. And draws not The day towards noon, whilst we have been astir Since dawn, nor broke our fasts? Arthur. Thrice happy thou Whom such a grief can trouble! Sir Edward. Nay, good brother Thou know'st the proverb says that a full sorrowâ But trust me Arthur 'tis for thee I grieve: I doubt the lady much. Arthur. Yet this fair seatâ Sir Edward. Didst ever see that sport of Fletcher's muse The comic scene where Leon tames the pride Of Margarita? Arthur. Yes; yes; yes. Sir Edward. And dost not Remember how a cunning quean, in the absence Of her rich mistress, cozened a gay gallant To wed her? Arthur. Yes; yes; yes. Sir Edward. And brought him home Even to her lady's dwelling? Arthur. Yes I tell thee. Beshrew thee, Edward, that hast put in words The very thought that woke within my heart Such torture! To have wedded poverty, Plain honest houseless poverty, were nothing, Poor though I be, were nothing! But a cheat, A stale and common cheat! perchance a lewdâ It cannot be, it shall not. Sir Edward. I would fain Prove an ill guesser. But what ground of faith Hast thou? Thou hast not seen her face, scarce e'en Her bearing,âso the veil and mantle shrouded A form of towering height; thou hast not heard Her voice, for surely, nay she owned as much, Her very tone was feigned. Thou may'st have wedded Old age and ugliness. Arthur. She's young and fair; Of that be sure. Didst thou not see the white Smooth dimpled hand, the taper fingers jewelled Even to the joint, the slender wrist with veins Meandering through its snow? Never such hand Pertained to aught save one as finely formed As delicately reared. It trembled too, That soft hand trembled and grew cold in mine With fearful modesty, then warmed again With love, quick fluttering love. Aye and athwart Her very wildest speech, although the words Were daring, and the purport rash and strange, Yet was the manner soft and maidenly, As of one born and nurtured in a pure And gentle dignity, that dared the rather, Because in her bold innocence she guessed not The censure she provoked. I'll trust her still, In all her mystery. Sir Edward. Heaven send her true! How wilt thou know her? Arthur. By the very sign We spake of; the fair hand. Sir Edward. The hand! Why, Arthur, Grant that the hand, so white and violet veined, The small pink palm and taper fingers pass For marks of beauty and of gentle blood; Yet many a gentle dame hath one as fair Asâ Arthur. Pshaw, man! Pshaw! The ring! The ring! Thou know'st How unprepared we came for spousal rites, But I by chance wore on my hand the gem, Sir Rowland's legacy, his famous Psyche, And in default of the plain golden round I slid the storied onyx on her finger;â Hark! (One of the doors of the saloon is thrown open.) Sure I heard light footsteps. Hark! Oh grant It may be she, unmasked, unveiled, disclosed In mind and person. Yet have I a fear Of this strange meeting mingled with my hope. Do thou accost her first. (Arthur retires to the windowâSir Edward remains in the middle of the apartment.) Sir Edward. None enters. Arthur. What! Another mockery? Sir Edward. No. I see her now, Beyond the gothic portal, in the hall, A noble lady, speaking with an air Of mild command to her mute menial train. Look! Thou may'st see her. Look! Arthur. I dare not. I'st The lady? Mine? Speak! Speak! Sir Edward. I know not, Arthur, In truth I know not. Yet it cannot be. She, whom we saw, could never have concealed That queenly shape, that goddess port. Arthur. Methought She too was graceful. Sir Edward. Why this is a Grace, Or rather a young Juno. Even a goddess Wanting the state imperial would lack somewhat Of her calm majesty. How those dark curls, Falling in their rich clusters evenly Adown those damask cheeks and that slim throat Of ivory, add to the placid grandeur Of her fair face. Yet those large modest eyes Have a quick brightness in them; a gay dimple Plays round that finely chiselled mouth,âshe's scarce So awful as she seems. Arthur. How is she robed? Like herâ Sir Edward. No! she was quaintly garmented In weeds of grey and pink,âa shrouding mantle, A black disfiguring mask, a floating veil: This lady hath a rich yet simple robe, Of whitest satin, a long ample robe, Purfled with lace and broidered with rare pearls; Pearls round her fairer neck, and one white rose Mixed with the ringlets whose luxuriant pride The golden bodkin scarce restrains. Arthur. The garb Is bride-like. Sir Edward. It but seems the meet array, The every day attire of that young beauty. Arthur. Her hand? Sir Edward. Is gloved. Sure I have seen that face! Was't in a picture? or a dream? No! no! I've seen her living self. 'Tis the rich heiress, The Lady Stanley. Dost thou not remember The good Lord Stanley, Arthur? the old friend Of our dear father? Many a time and oft Hast thou sate on his knee, a rosy boy, Whilst he hath talked to thee of his fair girl, His pretty black-eyed maid, and laughed to hear How thou wouldst vow when grown into a man That sheâWe were at Florence when he died; But two years since I saw, and scarcely saw, At court the blooming heiress. 'Tis herself! She comes. Stand not aloof, like village churl From that rare beauty, Arthur. Enter the Lady Stanley. Lady! Lady. Sirs, I crave your pardon, if, as I have heard, Ye have waited long untended. The bright sun Tempted me forth amongst the flowers. Sir Edward. Thyself A brighter, sweeter flower! Lady. Beseech ye, Sir, Waiving all compliment to tell at once Your errand hither. I should grieve to fail In courtesy to men of gentle seeming; But being here a maiden and alone, Rich therefore envied, young therefore exposed To evil thoughts and evil tongues, it suits not My state to harbour gallants such as ye Within my house, unless indeed the occasion May justify the visit. Seek ye ought Of me or mine? Sir Edward. Fair Madam, for myself I well may answer, No. My brother yonder Seeks, what full many a man hath vainly sought Of the young Lady Stanley,â Lady. Wherefore pause? What seeks the gentleman? Sir Edward. A wife, fair Madam! A wife! Lady. What mean ye, Sirs? Arthur. Not to offend Such beauty. Gentle lady, 'tis a tale, So wild, so strange, so marvellously true, I almost shame to tell it. Sir Edward. Shall I spare Thy blushes, Arthur? Lady. Nay, methinks the hero Will prove the best narrator. Sir Edward (aside). Say'st thou so? Lady. Pray ye, be seated, Sirs. Now to thy tale. Arthur. Much may befal in few short hours. Last night Whilst sojourning at Reading, thither called With this my kindest brother to attend A kinsman's bridal, and still lingering on In that gay pleasant town, a thriftless truant From law, dull law, and law's thrice dull abode The silent TempleâYesternight, returning Merrily to our Inn, a tiny page Slid in my hand a scroll and disappeared Ere we could ask, Whence com'st thou? 'Twas a cartel. Lady. Alas! Arthur. A challenge from some unknown foe To meet him, hand to hand, and sword to sword, At peep of day upon the Forbury Hill. Lady. Alas! Alas! How wild is man! Unknown too! Didst thou attend his summons? Arthur. Of surety. Lady. And heâ? Sir Edward. Aye now the marvel comes. Fair Madam, No He was there. Arthur. On that small eminence We met the dawn, and saw the morning mists Rise from the valley of the Thames, disclosing The dewy meadows, and the antique bridge, And Caversham's white hills,âbut foe saw none. Lady. Perchance he had repented his rash challenge. Sir Edward. Nay, lady, list the tale. Arthur. Foe saw we none Save a masked damsel pacing silently Beneath the venerable trees, which wave Their verdant plumage o'er the hill's steep brow. Lady. A damsel! and was she the foe? Sir Edward. Good sooth She's like to prove so. Lady. Sir!âMethinks thy brother Can tell his tale without thine aid.âThe Damsel? Arthur. Paced to and fro, fair Madam. Once or twice Drew near, then back again, as awe or shame Strove with some desperate purpose. Lady. Did she speak? Arthur. At last with, as it seemed to me, a forced And acted bravery, she drew a rapier Forth from beneath her cloak, avowed herself The challenger of yesternight, and then In few, brief, hurried words gave me the choice To fight her or to wed. Lady. Well, Sir! Sir Edward. Well, Madam! In faith thou must accept my story, Lady, Or else get none; he's silent from mere shame. But canst thouâfor all women have a gift Of divination in man's weakness,âcanst thou Look in his face, nor read at the first glance His answer? âBenedick the married manâ Is stamped on every feature. Ah! fool! fool! Arthur. Edward, beware lest this blunt mood of thine Carry thee past my patience. Sir Edward. Art thou not A fool? And am not I a triple fool To grieve o'er thy rank folly? Lady. But thy tale! He wedded then with this unknown? Sir Edward. Despite All counsel and all warning. Close at hand, Stood Church and Priest and Clerk in due array For his undoing. They were wedded, Lady, In shorter space than I have known the gallant Waste on the fashion of his doublet. Marry! This garment is for life. Lady. And she still masked? Sir Edward. Masked, nameless and unknown. At the Church porch Waited a gilded coach, which brought us straight To this fair hall; and the she Will-o'-the-wisp, The female Jack-o-lantern, having lodged us Safe in her cage, vanished through yonder door. Lady. 'Tis a strange tale. Sir Edward. A tale would make the fortune Of a score of ballad-mongers, an 'twere but a thought More credible. But, Madam, canst thou give No help in this wild strait, no clue to trace The run-away? Hast thou no damsel errante, No jill flirt in thy train were like to play The bride in this adventure? No pert quean Of a waiting-woman, or wild wanton cousin To cozen our young gallant? Lady. Out upon thee! Thou art uncivil. Sir Edward. Of a younger brother He's none so poor; and I, being, as thou seest, A bluff, unnurtured bachelor, foredoomed To break my neck in a fox chase, he may reckon On my succession. Many a prim she-cousin, The accustomed garnish of your noble tables, That combs my lady's lap-dog, gathers scandal For her diversion, is a skilful loser At every game, a frontless flatterer At every season, many such a pest, However gently born, had dared this venture For freedom and a husband. Lady. Once again Thou art uncivil, Sir. Thank heaven my kindred Are of a nobler temper. Sir Edward. My suspicions Point to the waiting-damsel. Your poor kinswoman Hath commonly a mincing delicate mien, Compound of fear and pride. Hast thou no wild Intriguess in thy train, whom love of goldâ Lady. Thou deemest that it must be love of gold? Sir Edward. Madam, I do. Lady. And thou? Arthur. I hope not so, And as I hope, believe. Woman is generous, Not mercenary. Sir Edward. Man is vain. I hold that The truer axiom. Lady. What did she resemble, This truant bride? Sir Edward. A strapping quean; as tall As the great may-pole on the green; as awkward As ever danced the may-day round; as pertâ Arthur. Hold! hold, good brother. She was of a height Noble, sweet lady, as thine own; as graceful Almost as thy fine form; and for her speech 'Twas frankness mixed with modesty. I trust To find a virtuous wife. Lady. A fair one too? Arthur. So please you, gracious Madam. Not perchance What might seem fair by thee;âfull many a flower Shews like a weed beside the rose. Lady. And rich? Think'st thou to find her rich? Arthur. For that I care not Howbeit she prove not mercenary. Sir Edward. Tush! If she be poor, how can she quit herself Of that suspicion?âMadam, once again, Canst thou end our wild quest? Lady. How should I! Maskedâ And nameless!âYe yourselves might meet this bride And pass her by unknown. Sir Edward. We have one tokenâ Arthur. A white and peerless hand. Sir Edward. A peerless ring! The hand was coarse and sunburnt, housewifely And toil-stained,âbut the ring! an antique cameo, A Psyche, a quaint butterfly, whose wings Rather of gauze than stone seemed springing up In act to fly, a piece of matchless art Found mid the ruins of old Rome, and rated Far above diamondsâTo think that gem Should deck some stale cheat's finger! Lady (taking off her glove). Was the ring Like this upon my hand? Arthur. My bride! my wife! Art thou indeed my wife? Lady. In very sooth No less. Arthur. Sweet ring, I worship thee. My wife! My beautiful! my true! Lady (to Sir Edward). Now, heretic, Was the masked bride a cheat? Sir Edward. Fair Lady Stanley, I cry you mercy! Lady. Nay thou 'scapst not soâ Was she a cheat? Sir Edward. My pretty sister, yes. Not when she wore a mask on her bright face, But when she doffed that mask, and strove to play The stranger!âsimpleton! as if each blush, And downcast look, and sighing smile, and low And faltering accent told not plain as words Her secret.âSister, were that lord of thine Less than a miracle of modesty, He must have known his bride. At the first glance I saw the trick, and instantly resolved To tease the teaser. Lady. 'Twas a strange and bold And venturous hazard;âbut I long had heard All good of Arthur Delmont: as a child From my dear father; as a youth from friends And kinsmen; and when I at last had seen, Had loved, and knew notâ'Twas unwomanly, Unmeet; but ye shall see the wife redeem The errors of the maid. Arthur. O may I merit Thy noble trust. Sir Edward. It was a generous sin And well may find forgiveness. Gentle madam, I have a heavier charge. Here in thy house, And on thy wedding-dayâpray Heaven thou use not To starve thy guests!âI, thy new husband's brother, Am famished. Arthur. Cannibal! Lady. I cry you mercy! But dinnerâ Sir Edward. Breakfast, Lady Stanley! Breakfast! I've tasted nought to-day. Lets in to breakfast And talk at ease of this strange chance. Thy hand Fair sister,âaye the ring becomes it well,â The antique wedding ring, an emblem fit Of happiness and love.âTo breakfast, quick! [Exeunt.</field>
