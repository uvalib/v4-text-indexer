      <field name="fulltext">The order of the dumme shewes and Musickes before euery Acte. First, before the beginning of the firste Acte, did sounde a dolefull and straunge noyse of violles, Cythren, Bandurion, and suche like, during the which, there came in vpon the Stage a King with an Imperiall Crowne vpon his head, very richely apparelled, a Scepter in his right hande, a Mounde with a Crosse in his left hande, sitting in a Chariote very richely furnished, drawne in by foure kinges in their Dublettes and Hosen, with Crownes also vpon their heades: Representing vnto vs Ambition, by the hystorie of Sesostres king of Egypt, who beeing in his time and reigne a mightie Conquerour, yet not content to haue subdued many Princes, and taken from them their kingdomes and dominions, did in lyke maner cause those Kinges whome he had so ouercome, to drawe in his Chariote like Beastes and Oxen, thereby to content his vnbrideled ambitious desire. After he had beene drawne twyce about the Stage, and retyred, the Musicke ceased, and Iocasta the Queene issued out of hir house, beginning the first Acte, as followeth. Iocasta the Queene issueth out of hir Pallace, before hir twelue Gentlemen very brauely apparelled, following after hir eight Gentlewomen, whereof foure be the Chorus that remayne on the Stage after hir departure. At hir entrance the Trumpettes sounded, and after she had gone once aboute the Stage, she turneth to one of hir moste trustie and estemed seruaunts, and vnto him she discloseth hir griefe, as foloweth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Acte. The first Scene IOCASTA. SERVVS. O Faithfull seruaunt of mine auncient sire, Though vnto thee, sufficiently be knowen The whole discourse of my recurelesse griefe By seing me from Princes royall state Thus basely brought into so great c?tempt, As mine owne sonnes repine to heare my plaint, Now of a Queene but barely bearing name, Seyng this towne, seyng my fleshe and bloude, Against it selfe to leuie threatning armes, (Wherof to talke my heart it rendes in twaine) Yet once againe, I must to thee recompte The wailefull thing that is alredy spred, Bycause I know, that pitie will compell Thy tender hart, more than my naturall childe, With ruthfull teares to mone my mourning case. Ser. My gracious Queene, as no man might surmount The constant faith I beare my souraine lorde, So doe I thinke, for loue and trustie zeale, No sonne you haue, doth owe you more than I: For hereunto I am by dutie bounde, With seruice meete no lesse to honor you, Than that renoumed prince your deere father. And as my duties be most infinite, So infinite, must also be my loue: Then if my life or spending of my bloude May be employed to doe your highnesse good, Commaunde (O queene) commaund this carcasse here. In spite of death to satisfie thy will, So, though I die, yet shall my willing ghost Contentedly forsake this withered corps, For ioy to thinke I neuer shewde my selfe Ingratefull once to suche a worthy Queene. Ioca. Thou knowst what care my carefull father tooke, In wedlockes sacred state to settle me With Laius, king of this vnhappie Thebs, That most vnhappie nowe our Citie is: Thou knowst, how he, desirous still to searche The hidden secrets of supernall powers, Unto Diuines did make his ofte recourse, Of them to learne when he should haue a sonne, That in his Realme might after him succeede: Of whom receiuing answere sharpe and sowre, That his owne sonne should worke his wailful ende, The wretched king (though all in vayne) did seeke For to eschew that could not be eschewed: And so, forgetting lawes of natures loue, No sooner had this paynfull wombe brought foorth His eldest sonne to this desired light, But straight he chargde a trustie man of his To beare the childe into a desert wood, And leaue it there, for Tigers to deuoure. Ser. O lucklesse babe, begot in wofull houre. Ioc. His seruant thus obedient to his hest, Up by the heeles did hang this faultlesse Impe, And percing with a knife his tender feete, Through both the wounds did drawe the slender twigs, Which beeing bound about his feeble limmes, Were strong inough to holde the little soule. Thus did he leaue this infant scarcely borne, That in short time must needes haue lost his life, If destenie (that for our greater greefes Decreede before to keepe it still alyue) Had not vnto this childe sent present helpe: For so it chaunst, a shepheard passing by, With pitie moude, did stay his giltlesse death: He toke him home, and gaue him to his wife, With homelie fare to fede and foster vp: Now harken how the heauens haue wroughte the way To Laius death, and to mine owne decay. âSer. Experience proues, and daily is it seene, âIn vaine, too vaine man striues against the heauens. Ioca. Not farre fro thence, the mightie Polibus, Of Corinth King, did kepe his princely court, Unto whose wofull wife (lamenting muche She had no ofspring by hir noble pheere) The curteous shepherd gaue my little sonne: Which gratefull gift, the Queene did so accept, As nothing seemde more precious in hir sight: Partly, for that, his faitures were so fine, Partly, for that, he was so beautifull, And partly, for bycause his comely grace Gaue great suspicion of his royall bloude. The infant grewe, and many yeares was demde Polibus sonne, till tyme, that Oedipus (For so he named was) did vnderstande That Polibus was not his sire in deede, Wherby forsaking frendes and countrie there, He did returne to seke his natiue stocke: And being come into Phocides lande, Toke notice of the cursed oracle, How first he shoulde his father doe to death, And then become his mothers wedded mate. Ser. O fierce aspecte of cruell planets all, That can decree such seas of heynous faultes. Ioca. Then Oedipus, fraight ful of chilling feare, By all meanes sought t'auoyde this furious fate, But whiles he weende to shunne the shamefull dede, Unluckly guyded by his owne mishappe, He fell into the snare that most he feared: For loe, in Phocides did Laius lye, To ende the broyles that ciuill discorde then Had raysed vp in that vnquiet lande, By meanes whereof my wofull Oedipus, Affording ayde vnto the other side, With murdring blade vnwares his father slewe. Thus heauenly doome, thus fate, thus powers diuine, Thus wicked reade of Prophets tooke effect: Nowe onely restes to ende the bitter happe Of me, of me his miserable mother. Alas, howe colde I feele the quaking bloud Passe too and fro within my trembling brest? Oedipus, when this bloudy deede was doone, Forst foorth by fatall doome, to Thebes came, Where as ful soone with glory he atchieude The crowne and scepter of this noble lande, By conquering Sphinx that cruell monster loe, That earst destroyde this goodly flouring soyle: And thus did I (O hatefull thing to heare) To my owne sonne become a wretched wife. Ser No meruayle, though the golden Sunne withdrew His glittering beames from suche a sinfull facte. Ioca. And so by him that from this belly sprang, I brought to light (O cursed that I am) Aswell two sonnes, as daughters also twayne: But when this monstruous mariage was disclosde, So sore began the rage of boyling wrath To swell within the furious brest of him, As he him selfe by stresse of his owne nayles, Out of his head did teare his griefull eyne, Unworthy more to see the shining light. Ser. Howe coulde it be, that knowing he had done So foule a blot, he would remayne aliue? âIoca. So deepely faulteth none, the which vnwares âDothe fall into the crime he can not shunne: And he (alas) vnto his greater greefe, Prolongs the date of his accursed dayes, Knowing that life dothe more and more increase The cruell plagues of his detested gilte, âWhere stroke of griesly death dothe set an ende âUnto the pangs of mans increasing payne. Ser. Of others all, moste cause haue we to mone Thy wofull smarte (O miserable Queene) Suche and so many are thy greeuous harmes. Ioca. Now to the ende this blinde outragious sire, Should reape no ioy of his vnnaturall fruite, His wretched sonnes, prickt foorth by furious spight, Adiudge their father to perpetuall prison: There buried in the depthe of dungeon darke, (Alas) he leades his discontented lyfe, Accursing still his stony harted sonnes, And wishing all th'infernall sprites of hell, To breathe suche poysned hate into their brestes, As eche with other fall to bloudy warres, And so with pricking poynt of piercing blade, To rippe their bowels out, that eche of them With others bloud might stayne his giltie hands, And bothe at once by stroke of speedie death Be foorthwith throwne into the Stigian lake. Ser. The mightie Gods preuent so fowle a deede. Ioca. They to auoyde the wicked blasphemies, And sinfull prayer of their angrie sire, Agreed thus, that of this noble realme, Untill the course of one full yere was runne, Eteocles should sway the kingly mace, And Polynice as exul should departe, Till time expyrde: and then to Polynice Eteocles should yeelde the scepter vp: Thus yere by yere the one succeeding other, This royall crowne should vnto bothe remayne. Ser. Oh thunbridled mindes of ambicious men. Ioca. Eteocles, thus plast in princely seate, Drunke with the sugred taste of kingly raigne, Not onely shut his brother from the crowne, But also from his natiue country soyle. Alas poore Polynice, what might he doe, Uniustly by his brother thus betrayed? To Argos he, with sad and heauie cheere Forthwith conuayde him selfe, on whom at length With fauning face good fortune smyled so, As with Adrastus king of Argiues there, He founde suche fauour and affinitie, As to restore my sonne vnto his raigne, He hath besedge this noble citie Thebes. And hence proceedes, my most extreme annoye: For, of my sonnes, who euer doe preuaile, The victorie will turne vnto my griefe: Alas, I feare (such is the chaunce of warre) That one, or both shall purchase death therby. Wherfore, to shunne the worst that may befall, Thoughe comfortlesse, yet as a pitifull mother Whom nature bindes to loue hir louing sonnes, And to prouide the best for their auaile, I haue thought good by prayers to intreate The two brethren (nay rather cruell foes) A while to staie their fierce and furious fight, Till I haue tried by meanes for to appease, The swelling wrath of their outraging willes. And so with much to doe, at my request They haue forborne vnto this onely houre. Ser. Small space god wot, to stint so great a strife. Ioca. And euen right now, a trustie man of mine, Returned from the campe, enforming me That Polynice will straight to Thebes c?me, Thus of my woe, this is the wailefull s?me. And for bycause, in vaine and bootelesse plainte I haue small neede to spend this litle time, Here will I ceasse, in wordes more to bewray The restlesse state of my afflicted minde, Desiring thee, thou goe to Eteocles, Hartly on my behalfe beseching him, That out of hand according to his promise, He will vouchsafe to come vnto my courte, I know he loues thee well, and to thy wordes I thinke thou knowst he will giue willing eare. Ser. (O noble Queene) sith vnto such affayres My spedie diligence is requisite, I will applie effectually to doe What so your highnesse hath commaunded me. Ioca.

O Gentle daughter of King Oedipus, O sister deare to that vnhappie wight Whom brothers rage hath reaued of his right, To whom, thou knowst, in yong and tender yeares I was a friend and faithfull gouernour, Come forth, sith that hir grace hath graunted leaue, And let me knowe what cause hath moued nowe So chaste a maide to set hir daintie foote Ouer the thresholde of hir secrete lodge? Since that the towne is furnishte euerywhere With men of armes and warlike instrumentes, Unto our eares there c?mes no other noyse, But sounde of trumpe, and neigh of trampling stedes, Which running vp and downe from place to place, With hideous cries betoken bloude and death: The blasing sunne ne shineth halfe so brighte, As it was wont to doe at dawne of daye: The wretched dames throughout the wofull towne, Together clustring to the temples goe, Beseching Ioue by way of humble plainte, With tender ruthe to pitie their distresse. An. The loue I beare to my sweete Polynice, My deare brother, is onely cause hereof. Bai. Why daughter, knowst thou any remedie How to defend thy fathers citie here From that outrage and fierce repyning wrathe, Which he against it, iustly hath conceiued? An. Oh gouernour might this my faultlesse bloude Suffise to stay my brethrens dyre debate, With glad consent I coulde afford my life Betwixt them both to plant a perfect peace: But since (alas) I cannot as I woulde, A hote desire inflames my feruent mind To haue a sight of my sweete Pollynice. Wherfore (good guide) vouchsafe to guide me up Into some tower aboute this hugie court, From whence I may behold our enemies campe, Therby at least to feede my hungry eyes But with the sight of my beloued brother: Then if I die, contented shall I die. Bai. O princely dame, the tender care thou takste Of thy deare brother, deserueth double praise: Yet crau'st thou that, which cannot be obtainde, By reason of the distance from the towne Unto the plaine, where tharmie lies incampt: And furthermore, besemeth not a maide To shew hir selfe in such vnsemely place, Wheras among such yong and lustie troupes Of harebrainde souldiers marching to and fro, Both honest name and honour is empairde: But yet reioyce, sith this thy great desire, Without long let, or yet without thy paine, At wishe and will shall shortly be fulfillde. For Polynice forthwith will hither come, Euen I my selfe was lately at the campe, Commaunded by the Queene to bid him come, Who laboureth still to linke in frendly league, Hir iarring sonnes (which happe so hoped for, Eftsones I pray the gracious gods to graunt) And sure I am, that ere this houre passe, Thou shalt him here in person safely see. Auti. O louing frend, doest thou then warrant me, That Polynice will come vnto this court? Bai. Ere thou be ware thou shalt him here beholde. Anti. And who (alas) doth warrant his aduenture, That of Eteocles he take no harme? Bai. For constant pledge, he hath his brothers faith, He hath also the truce that yet endures. An. I feare alas, alas I greatly feare, Some trustlesse snare his cruell brother layes To trappe him in. Bai. Daughter, god knowes how willing I would be With sweete reliefe to comfort thy distresse, But I cannot impart to thee, the good Which I my selfe doe not as yet enioye. The wailefull cause that moues Eteocles With Pollinyce to enter ciuill warres Is ouergreat, and for this onely cause Full many men haue broke the lawes of truth, And topsieturuie turned many townes. âTo gredie (daughter) too too gredie is âDesire to rule and raigne in kingly state. Ne can he bide, that swaise a realme alone To haue another ioynde with him therin: Yet must we hope for helpe of heauenly powers, Sith they be iuste, their mercy is at hand, To helpe the weake when worldly force doth faile. An. As both my brethren be, so both I beare As much goodwill as any sister may, But yet the wrong that vnto Pollinyce This trothlesse tyrant hath vniustlie shewd, Doth leade me more, to wishe the prosperous life, Of Pollinyce, than of that cruell wretch. Besides that, Pollinyce whiles he remainde In Thebes here, did euer loue me more, Than did Eteocles, whose swelling hate Is towardes me increased more and more: Wherof I partly may assure my selfe, Considering he disdaynes to visite me, Yea, happly he intends to reaue my life, And hauing power he will not sticke to doe it. This therefore makes me earnestly desire Oftymes to see him: yet euer as I thinke For to discharge the duetie of a sister, The feare I haue of hurt, doth chaunge fast My doubtfull loue into disdaynefull spight. Bai. Yet daughter, must ye trust in mightie Ioue, His will is not, that for thoffence of one So many suffer vndeserued smarte: I meane of thee, I meane of Polinyce, Of Iocasta thy wofull aged mother, And of Ismena thy beloued sister. Who though for this she dothe not outwardly From drearie eyen distill lamenting teares, Yet do I thinke, no lesse afflicting griefe Dothe inwardly torment hir tender brest. An. Besides all this, a certayne ielousie, Lately conceyude (I knowe not whence it springs) Of Creon, my mothers brother, appaules me muche, Him doubt I more than any danger else. Bai. Deare daughter, leaue this foolishe ielousie, And seeing that thou shalt heere shortly finde Thy brother Polinyce, go in agayne. An. O ioyfull would it be to me therwhile, To vnderstande the order of the hoste, Whether it be suche as haue sufficient power To ouerthrowe this mightie towne of Thebs. What place supplies my brother Polynice? Where founde ye hym? what answere did he giue? And though so great a care perteineth not Unto a mayde of my vnskilfull yeres, Yet, forbicause my selfe partaker am Of good and euill with this my countrey soyle, I long to heare thee tell those fearfull newes, Which otherwise I can not vnderstande. Bai. So noble a desire (O worthy dame) I muche commende: and briefly as I can, Will satisfie thy hungry minde herein. The power of men that Polinyce hath brought, (Wherof he, (being Adrastus sonne in lawe) Takes chiefest charge) is euen the floure of Grece, Whose hugie traine so mightie seemes to be, As I see not, how this our drouping towne Is able to withstand so strong a siege. Entring the fielde their armie did I finde So orderly in forme of battaile set, As though they would forthwith haue giuen the charge: In battailes seauen the host deuided is, To eche of which, by order of the king, A valiant knight for captaine is assignde: And as you know this citie hath seuen gates, So euerie captaine hath his gate prescribde, With fierce assault to make his entrie at. And further, passing through our frouning foes (That gaue me countenance of a messanger) Harde by the King I spied Pollinyce, In golden glistring armes most richely cladde, Whose person many a stately prince enpalde, And many a comely crowned head enclosde: At sight of me his colour straight he chaungde And like a louing childe in clasped armes He caught me vp, and frendly kist my cheke, Then hearing what his mother did demaunde With glad consent according to hir hest Gaue me his hand, to come vnto the court, Of mutuall truce desirous so he seemde, He askt me of Antygone, and Ismena. But chiefelie vnto thee aboue the rest He gaue me charge most hartely to commend him. An. The gods giue grace he may at length possesse His kingly right and I his wished sight. Bai. Daughter no more, t'is time ye nowe returne It standeth not with the honor of your state Thus to be seene suspiciouslie abrode: âFor vulgar tongues are armed euermore âWith slaunderous brute to bleamishe the renoume âOf vertues dames, which though at first it spring âOf slender cause, yet doth it swell so fast, âAs in short space it filleth euerie eare âWith swifte report of vndeserued blame: âYou cannot be too curious of your name, âFond shewe of euill (though still the minde be chast) âDecayes the credite oft, that Ladies had, âSometimes the place presumes a wanton mynde: âRepayre sometymes of some, doth hurt their honor: âSometimes the light and garishe proude attire âPersuades a yelding bent of pleasing youthes. The voyce that goeth of your vnspotted fame, Is like a tender floure, that with the blast Of euerie litle winde doth fade away. Goe in deere childe, this way will I goe see If I can meete thy brother Pollinyce. Antigone vvith hir maides returneth into hir mothers pallace, hir gouernour goeth oute by the gates Homoloydes. CHORVS. If greedie lust of mans ambitious eye (That thristeth so for swaye of earthly things) Would eke foresee, what mischiefes growe therby, What carefull toyle to quiet state it brings, What endlesse griefe from such a fountaine springs: Then should he swimme in seas of sweete delight, That nowe complaines of fortunes cruell spight. For then he would so safely shielde himselfe With sacred rules of wisedomes sage aduise, As no alluring trayne of trustles pelfe, To fonde affectes his fancie should entise, Then warie heede would quickly make him wise: Where contrary (such is our skillesse kind) We most doe seeke, that most may hurt the minde. Amid the troupe of these vnstable toyes, Some fancies loe to beautie most be bent, Some hunt for wealth, and some set all their ioyes, In regall power of princely gouernement, Yet none of these from care are cleane exempt: For either they be got with grieuous toyle, Or in the ende forgone with shamefull foyle. This flitting world doth firmely nought retaine, Wherin a man may boldly rest his trust, Such fickle chaunce in fortune doth remaine, As when she lust, she threatneth whom she lust, From high renoume to throwe him in the dust: Thus may we see that eche triumphing ioye By fortunes froune is turned to annoye. Those elder heads may well be thought to erre, The which for easie life and quiet dayes, The vulgar sort would seeme for to preferre. If glorious PhÅbe, with-holde his glistring rayes, From such a peere as crowne and scepter swayes, No meruaile though he hide his heauenly face, From vs that come of lesse renoumed race. Selde shall you see the ruine of a Prince, But that the people eke like brunt doe beare, And olde recordes of auncient time long since, From age to age, yea almost euerie where, With proofe hereof hath glutted euery eare: Thus by the follies of the princes harte, The bounden subiect stil receiueth smart. Loe, how vnbrideled lust of priuate raigne, Hath pricked both the brethren vnto warre: Yet Pollinyce, with signe of lesse disdaine, Against this lande hath brought from countries farre, A forraine power, to end this cruell iarre, Forgetting quite the dutie, loue, and zeale, He ought to beare vnto this common weale. But whosoeuer gets the victorie, We wretched dames, and thou O noble towne, Shall feele therof the wofull miserie, Thy gorgeous pompe, thy glorious high renoume, Thy stately towers, and all shall fall a downe, Sith raging Mars will eache of them assist In others brest to bathe his bloudie fist. But thou O sonne of Semel, and of Ioue, (That tamde the proude attempt of giaunts strong) Doe thou defende, euen of thy tender loue, Thy humble thralls from this afflicting wrong, Whom wast of warre hath now tormented long: So shall we neuer faile ne day ne night With reuerence due thy prayses to resight.

My woorthie dame, I fynde that tryed truthe âDoth beste beseeme a simple naked tale, âNe needes to be with painted proces prickt, âThat in hir selfe hath no diuersitie, âBut alwayes shewes one vndisguysed face, âWhere deepe deceipt and lyes muste seeke the shade, âAnd wrap their wordes in guilefull eloquence, âAs euer fraught with contrarietie: So haue I often sayde, and say agayne, That to auoide our fathers foule reproche And bitter curse, I parted from this lande With right good will, yet thus with him agreed, That while the whirling wyngs of flying time Might roll one yeare aboute the heauenly spheare, So long alone he might with peace possesse Our fathers seate in princely diademe, And when the yeare should eke his course renue, Might I succeede to rule againe as long. And that this lawe might stil be kept for aye, He bound him selfe by vowe of solemne oth By Gods, by men, by heauen, and eke by earth: Yet that forgot, without all reuerence Unto the Gods, without respect to right, Without respecte that reason ought to rule, His faith and troth both troden vnder foote, He still vsurps most tyrantlike with wrong The right that doth of right to me belong. But if he can with equall doome consent, That I retourne into my natiue soile To sway with him alyke the kingly seate And euenly beare the bridle both in hand, Deare mother mine I sweare by all the Gods To raise with speede the siege from these our walles, And send the souldiers home from whence they came: Which if he graunt me not, then must I do (Though loth) as much as right and reason would, To venge my cause that is both good and iust. Yet this in heauen the Gods my records be, And here in earth each mortall man may know, That neuer yet my giltlesse heart did faile Brotherly dutie to Eteocles, And that causlesse he holdes me from mine own, Thus haue I said O mother, euen as much As needefull is, wherein I me assure, That in the iudgement both of good and badde, My words may seeme of reason to proceede, Constrained thus in my defence to speake. Chor. None may denie, O pere of princely race, But that thy words are honest, good and iust, And such as well beseeme that tong of thine. âEteo. If what to some seemes honest, good and iust, âCould seeme euen so in euery doubtfull mind, âNo darke debate nor quarell could arise: âBut looke, how many men so many minds, âAnd that, that one man iudgeth good and iust, âSome other deemes as deepely to be wrong. To say the truth (mother) this minde of mine Doth fleete full farre from that farfetch of his, Ne will I longer couer my conceit: If I could rule or reigne in heauen aboue, And eke commaund in depth of darksome hell, No toile ne trauell should my sprites abashe, To make the way vnto my restlesse will, To climbe aloft, nor downe for to descend. Then thinke you not, that I can yeld consent To yeld a parte of my possession, Wherein I liue and lead the monarchie. âA witlesse foole may euery man him gesse, âThat leaues the more and takes him to the lesse. With this, reproch might to my name redound, If he, that hath with forren power spoilde Our pleasaunt fields, might reaue from me perforce, What so he list by force of armes demand. No lesse reproofe the citizens ensewes, If I, for dread of Greekish hosts, should graunt That he might climbe to height of his desire. In fine, he ought not thus of me to craue Accord or peace, with bloudy sword in hand, But with humilitie and prayer both. For often is it seene, and proofe doth teach, âSwete words preuaile, where sword and fire faile. Yet this, if here within these stately walles He list to liue, the sonne of Oedipus, And not as king of Thebes, I stand content. But let him thinke, since now I can commaunde, This necke of mine shall neuer yeld to yoke Of seruitude: let bring his banners splaide, Let speare and shielde, sharpe sworde, and cyndring flames Procure the parte that he so vainely claimes: As long as life within this brest doth last, I nill consent that he should reigne with me. If lawe of right may any way be broke, âDesire of rule within a climbing brest âTo breake a vow may beare the buckler best. âCho. Who once hath past the bounds of honestie âIn ernest deedes, may passe it well in words. Ioca. O sonne, amongst so many miseries This benefite hath croked age, I find, That as the tracke of trustlesse time hath taught, âIt seeth muche, and many things discernes, âWhich recklesse youth can neuer rightly iudge. Oh, cast aside that vaine ambition, That corosiue, that cruell pestilence, That most infects the minds of mortall men: âIn princely palace and in stately townes âIt crepeth ofte, and close with it conuayes, âTo leaue behind it damage and decayes: âBy it be loue and amitie destroyde, âIt breaks the lawes and common concord beates, âKingdomes and realmes it topsie turuie turnes, And now, euen thee, hir gall so poisoned hath, That the weake eies of thine affection Are blinded quite, and see not to them selfe But worthy childe, driue from thy doubtfull brest This monstrous mate, in steade whereof embrace âEqualitie, which stately states defends âAnd binds the mind with true and trustie knots âOf friendly faith which neuer can be broke, âThis, man of right should properly possesse, And who that other doth the more embrace, Shall purchase paine to be his iust reward By wrathfull wo or else by cruell death. âThis, first deuided all by equall bonds âWhat so the earth did yeld for our auaile: âThis, did deuide the nights and dayes alike, âAnd that the vaile of darke and dreadfull night, âWhich shrowds in misty clouds the pleasaunt light, âNe yet the golden beames of Phebus rayes âWhich cleares the dimmed ayre with gladsome gleames âCan yet heape hate in either of them both. If then the dayes and nights to serue our tourne Content them selues to yeld each other place, Well oughtest thou with waightie doome to graunt Thy brothers right to rule the reigne with thee Which heauens ordeyned common to you both: If so thou nill O sonne O cruell sonne, âIn whose high brest may iustice builde hir boure âWhen princes harts wide open lye to wrong? Why likes thee so the tipe of tyrannie With others losse to gather greedy gaine? âAlas howe farre he wanders from the truth âThat compts a pompe, all other to command, âYet can not rule his owne vnbridled wil, âA vaine desire much riches to possesse âWhereby the brest is brusde and battered still, âWith dread, with daunger, care and cold suspecte. âWho seekes to haue the thing we call inough, âAcquainte him first with contentation, âFor plenteousnesse is but a naked name. âAnd what suffiseth vse of mortall men, âShall best apaye the meane and modest hearts. âThese hoorded heapes of golde and worldly wealth âAre not the proper goods of any one, âBut pawnes which Ioue powres out aboundantly âThat we likewise might vse them equally, âAnd as he seemes to lende them for a time, âEuen so in time he takes them home agayne, âAnd would that we acknowledge euery houre, âThat from his handes we did the same receiue: âTher nothing is so firme and stayde to man, âBut whyrles about with wheeles of restlesse time. Now if I should this one thing thee demaunde, Which of these two thou wouldest chuse to keepe, The towne quiet or vnquiet tyrannie? And wouldest thou saye I chuse my kingly cheare? O witlesse answere sent from wicked heart, For if so fall (which mightie Gods defende) Thine enimies hand should ouercome thy might, And thou shouldst see them sacke the towne of Thebes, The chastest virgins rauished for wrecke, The worthy children in captiuitie, âThen shouldest thou feele that scepter, crowne, &amp; wealth âYeelde deeper care to see them tane away, âThan to possesse them yeldeth deepe content. Now to conclude, my sonne, Ambition Is it that most offendes thy thought, Blame not thy brother, blame ambition From whome if so thou not redeeme thy selfe, I feare to see thee buy repentance deare. Ch. Yea deare, too deare when it shal come too late, Ioc. And nowe to thee my Polinices deare, I say that sillie was Adrastus reade, And thou God knowes a simple sillie soule, He to be ruled by thy heady will, And thou, to warre against the Thebane walls, These walls I say whose gates thy selfe should garde: Tell me I praye thee, if the Citie yeelde, Or thou it take by force in bloudie fight, (Which neuer graunt the Gods I them beseeke) What spoyles? what Palmes? what signe of victorie Canst thou set vp to haue thy countrie woonne? What title worthy of immortall fame, Shall blased be in honor of thy name? O sonne, deare sonne, beleeue thy trustie dame, The name of glorie shall thy name refuse, And flie full farre from all thy fonde attemptes. But if so fall thou shouldst be ouercome, Then with what face canst thou returne to Greece, That here hast lefte so many Greekes on grounde? Eache one shall curse and blame thee to thy face, As him that onely caused their decaye, And eke condemne Adrastus simple heade, That such a pheere had chosen for his childe. So may it fall, in one accursed houre, That thou mayst loose thy wife and countrie both, Both which thou mayst with little toyle attaine, If thou canst leaue high minde and darke disdaine. Cho. O mightie Gods of goodnesse, neuer graunt Unto these euills, but set desired peace Betweene the hearts of these two friendly foes. Ete. The question that betwixt vs two is growen, Beleeue me mother, can not ende with wordes: You waste your breath, and I but loose my time, And all your trauell lost and spent in vaine: For this I sweare, that peace you neuer get Betweene vs two, but with condition, That whilst I liue, I wil be Lord of Thebes. Then set aside these vaine forewasted wordes, And yeelde me leaue to go where neede doth presse: And now good sir, get you out of these walles, Unlesse you meane to buy abode with bloude. Po. And who is he that seekes to haue my bloude, And shall not shed his owne as fast as myne? Ete. By thee he standes, and thou standst him before, Loe here the sworde that shall perfourme his worde. Po. And this shall eke mainteine my rightfull cause. Ioc. O sonnes, dear sonnes, away with glittring armes, And first, before you touch each others flesh, With doubled blowes come pierce this brest of mine. Po. Ah wretch, thou art both vile and cowardlike, Thy high estate esteemes thy life too deare. Ete. If with a wretch or cowarde shouldest thou fighte, Oh dastarde villaine, what first moued thee With swarmes of Greekes to take this enterprise? Po. For well I wist, that cancred heart of thine Coulde safely kepe thy heade within these walles, And flee the fielde when combate should be callde. Ete. This truce assured thee Polinices, And makes thee bolde to gyue suche bosting wordes: So be thou sure, that had this truce not bene, Then long ere this, these handes had bene embrude, And eke this soyle besprinkled with thy bloude. Po. Not one small drop of my bloude shalt thou spill, But buy it deare against thy cancred will. Ioc. O sonnes, my sonnes, for pittie yet refrayne. Ch. Good Gods, who euer sawe so strange a sight? True loue and friendship both be put to flight. Po. Yelde villein, yelde my right which thou with-holds. Ete. Cut of thy hope to reigne in Thebane walles, Nought hast thou here, nor nought shal euer haue, Away. Po. O aultars of my countrie soyle. Ete. Whome thou art come to spoyle and to deface. Po. O Gods, giue eare vnto my honest cause. Ete. With forreine power his countrie to inuade. Po. O holy temples of the heauenly Gods. Ete. That for thy wicked deedes do hate thy name. Po. Out of my kingdome am I driuen by force. Ete. Out of the which thou camest me to driue. Po. Punish O Gods this wicked tyrant here. Ete. Praye to the Gods in Greece and not in Thebes. Po. No sauage beast so cruell nor vniust. Ete. Not cruell to my countrie like to thee. Po. Since from my right I am with wrong depriued. Ete. Eke from thy life if long thou tary here. Po. O father heare what iniuries I take. Ete. As though thy diuelishe deedes were hid from him. Po. And you mother. Eteo. Haue done thou not deseruest With that false tong thy mother once to name. Po. O deare Citie. Eteo. When thou ariuest in Greece, Chuse out thy dwelling in some mustie Moores. Po. I must depart, and parting must I prayse Oh deare mother the depth of your good will. Ioc. O Sonne. Eteo. Away I say out of these walls. Po. I can not chuse but must thy will obey, Yet graunt me once my father for to see. Ete. I heare no prayers of my enimie. Po. Where be my sweete sisters. Eteo. And canst thou yet With shamelesse tong once name thy noble race That art become a common foe to Thebes? Be sure thou shalt them neuer see againe, Nor other friend that in these walls remaine. Po. Rest you in peace, O worthy mother myne. Ioc. Howe can that be and thou my ioye in warre? Po. Hence forth n'am I your ioy ne yet your sonne. Ioc. Alas the Heauens me whelme with all mishap. Po. Lo here the cause that stirreth me by wrong. Ete. Much more is that he profereth vnto me. Po. Well, speake, darest thou come armed to the fielde? Ete. So dare I come, wherefore dost thou demaunde? Po. For needes or thou must ende this life of minde Or quenche my thirst with pouring out thy bloud. Eteo. Ah wretch, my thirst is all as drie as thine. Io. Alas and welaway, what heare I sonnes? How can it be? deare children can it be That brethrens hearts suche rancour should enrage? Eteo. And that right soone the proofe shall playnely shewe. Io. Oh say not so, yet say not so deare sonnes. Po. O royall race of Thebes now take thine ende. Cho. God shield. Eteo. O slow &amp; sluggish heart of mine, Why do I stay t'embrew these slouthfull hands? But for his greater griefe I will departe, And at returne if here I finde my foe, This hastie hande shall ende our hote debate. Eteocles here goeth out by the gates ElectrÃ¦. Po. Deare Citizens, and you eternall Gods, Beare witnesse with me here before the worlde, How this my fierce and cruell enimie, Whom causelesse now my brother I do call, With threats of death my lingring steps doth driue Both from my right and from my countrey soyle, Not as beseemes the sonne of Oedipus, But as a slaue, an abiect, or a wretche: And since you be both pitifull and iuste, Uouchsafe O Gods, that as I parte with griefe, So may I yet returne with ioyfull spoyle Of this accursed tyraunt, and he slayne I may recouer quietly mine owne. Polinyces goeth out by the gates Homoloides. Io. O wretched wretche Iocasta, where is founde The miserie that may compare to thine? O would I had nor gasing eyes to see, Nor listning eares to heare that now I dread: But what remaynes, saue onely to entreate That cruell dole would yet so curteous be To reaue the breath out of this wofull brest, Before I hearken to some wofull newes. Rest you here dames, and pray vnto the Gods For our redresse, and I in that meane while Will shut my selfe from sight of lothsome light. Iocasta goeth into hir Pallace. Cho. O mightie God, the gouernour of Thebes, Pitie with speede the payne Iocasta bydes, And eke our needes, O mightie Bacchus helpe, Bende willing eare vnto our iust complaynt: Leaue them not comfortlesse that trust in thee, We haue nor golde nor siluer thee to giue, Ne sacrifice to those thine aulters due, In steede wherof we consecrate our hearts To serue thy will, and hestes for to obey. VVhyles the Chorus is thus praying to Bacchus, Eteocles returneth by the gates called ElectrÃ¦. Scena. ij. ETEOCLES. CREON. Since I haue ridde mine enmie out of sight, The best shall be, for Creon now to sende, My mothers brother, that with him I may Reason, consulte, conferre, and counsell bothe, What shall be best to vse in our defence, Before we venter forth into the fielde. But of this trauayle, loe, he me acquites That comes in haste towards these royall towres. Here Creon attended by foure gentlemen, c?meth in by the gates Homoloydes. Cre. O mightie king, not causelesse nowe I come, To finde, that long haue sought your maiestie. So to discharge the duetie that I owe To you, by comfort and by counsell bothe. Ete. No lesse desire this harte of mine did presse, To sende for thee Creon, since that in vayne My mother hath hir words and trauayle spent, To reconcile Pollinices and me: For he (so dull was his capacitie) Did thinke, he could by dread of daunger, winne My princely heart to yeelde to him this realme. Cre. I vnderstande, the armie that he brings Agaynst these walles, is suche, that I me doubte Our cities force may scarce the same resist. Yet true it is, that right and reason bothe Are on our side, which bring the victorie Oftetimes: for we our countrey to defende, They to subdue the same in armes are come. But what I would vnto your highnesse shewe, Is of more weight, and more behoues to knowe. Ete. And what is that? oh quickly tell it me. Cre. A Greeke prisner is come vnto my hands. Ete. And what sayth he that doth so muche importe? Cre. That euen already be their rankes in raye, And streight will giue assault to these our walles. Ete. Then must I streight prepare our Citizens In glittring armes to marche into the fielde. Cre. O Prince (and pardon me) thy youthfull yeres Nor see them selfe, ne let thee once discerne, What best behoueth in this doubtfull case. âFor Prudence, she that is the mightie queene âOf all good workes, growes by experience, âWhich is not founde with fewe dayes seeking for.

With equall number see you do them matche. Ete. And then commit our men in charge to them? Cre. Chusing the best and boldest blouds in Thebes. Ete. And how shall I the Citie then defende? Cre. Well with the rest, for one man sees not all. Ete. And shall I chuse the boldest or the wisest? Cre. Nay both, for one without that other fayles. âEte. Force without wisedome then is litle worthe.

Cre. As you commaund, so ought I to performe. Ete. And last, I thee and citie both commaund, If fortune frendly fauour our attemptes, And make our men triumphant victors al, That none there be so hardie ne so bolde For Pollinices bones to giue a graue: And who presumes to breake my heste herein, Shall dye the death in penaunce of his paine, For thoughe I were by bloud to him conioynde I part it now, and iustice goeth with me To guide my steppes victoriously before.

Gramercie worthie prince, for all thy loue And faithfull trust thou doest in me repose, And if should hap, that I hope neuer shall, I promise yet to doe what best behoues, But chieflie this I sweare and make a vowe, For Pollinices nowe our cruell foe, To holde the hest that thou doest me commaunde. Creon attendeth Eteocles to the gates ElectrÃ¦, he returneth and goeth out by the gates called Homoloydes. CHORVS. O Fierce and furious God, whose harmefull harte, Reioyceth most to shed the giltlesse blood, Whose headie wil doth all the world subuert, And doth enuie the pleasant mery moode, Of our estate that erst in quiet stoode, Why doest thou thus our harmelesse towne annoye, Which mightie Bacchus gouerned in ioye? Father of warre and death, that dost remoue With wrathfull wrecke from wofull mothers breast, The trustie pledges of their tender loue, So graunt the Gods, that for our finall rest, Dame Uenus pleasant lookes may please thee best, Wherby when thou shalt all amazed stand, The sword may fall out of thy trembling hand. And thou maist proue some other way full well The bloudie prowesse of thy mightie speare, Wherwith thou raisest from the depth of hell, The wrathfull sprites of all the furies there, Who when they wake, doe wander euery where, And neuer rest to range aboute the coastes, T'enriche that pit with spoile of damned ghostes. And when thou hast our fieldes forsaken thus, Let cruell discorde beare thee companie, Engirt with snakes and serpents venemous, Euen she that can with red vermilion dye The gladsome greene that florished pleasantly, And make the greedie grounde a drinking cup, To sup the bloud of murdered bodyes vp. Yet thou returne O ioye and pleasant peace, From whence thou didst against our will departe, Ne let thy worthie minde from trauell cease, To chase disdaine out of the poysoned harte, That raised warre to all our paynes and smarte, Euen from the brest of Oedipus his sonne, Whose swelling pride hath all this iarre begonne. And thou great God, that doth all things decree, And sitst on highe aboue the starrie skies, Thou chiefest cause of causes all that bee, Regard not his offence but heare our cries, And spedily redresse our miseries, For what can we poore wofull wretches doe But craue thy aide, and onely cleaue therto?

Sacerdos accompanyed vvith .xvj. bacchanales and all his rytes and ceremonies entreth by the gates Homoloydes. Sacer. O famous Citizens, that holde full deare Your quiet country: Loe where I doe come Most ioyfully, with wonted sacrifice, So to beseeche the supreme Citizens, To stay our state that staggringly do stand, And plant vs peace where warre and discord growes: Wherfore, with harte deuoute and humble cheere, Whiles I breake vp the bowels of this beast, That oft thy vyneyarde Bacchus hath destroyed, Let euery wight craue pardon for his faultes, With bending knee about his aultars here. Tyr. Take here the salte, and sprinckle therwithall About the necke, that done, cast all the rest Into the sacred fire, and then annoynte The knife prepared for the sacrifice. O mightie Ioue, preserue the precious gifte That thou me gaue, when first thine angrie Queene, For deepe disdayne did both mine eyes do out, Graunt me, I may foretell the truth in this, For, but by thee, I know that I ne may, Ne will ne can, out trustie sentence say, Sa. This due is done. Tyr. With knife then stick ye kid. Sac. Thou daughter of deuine Tyresias, With those vnspotted virgins hands of thine Receiue the bloude within this vessell here, And then deuoutly it to Bacchus yelde. Man. O holy God of Thebes, that doest both praise Swete peace, and doest in hart also disdayne The noysome noyse, the furies and the fight Of bloudie Mars and of Bellona both: O thou the giuer both of ioy and health, Receyue in gree and with well willing hand These holy whole brunt offrings vnto thee, And as this towne doth wholy thee adore, So by thy helpe do graunt that it may stand Safe from the enmyes outrage euermore. Sac. Now in thy sacred name I bowell here This sacrifice. Tyre. And what entralls hath it? Sac. Faire and welformed all in euery poynt, The liuer cleane, the hart is not infect, Saue loe, I finde but onely one hart string By which I finde somwhat I wote nere what, That seemes corrupt, and were not onely that, In all the rest, they are both sounde and hole. Tyr. Now cast at once into the holy flame The swete incense, and then aduertise mee What hew it beares, and euery other ryte That ought may helpe the truth for to coniecte. Sac. I see the flames doe sundrie colours cast, Now bloudy sanguine, straight way purple, blew, Some partes seeme blacke, some gray, and some be greene. Tyr. Stay there, suffyseth this for to haue seene, Know Creon, that these outward seemely signes By that the Gods haue let me vnderstand Who vnderstandeth al and seeth secrete things, Betokeneth that the Citie great of Thebes Shall Uictor be against the Greekish host, If so consent be giuen, but more than this I lyst not say: Cre. Alas for curtesie Say on Tyresias, neuer haue respect To any liuing man, but tell the truth. Sacerdos returneth vvith the Bacchan by the gates homoloides. Sac. In this meane while I will returne with speede From whence I came, for lawfull is it not, That suche as I should heare your secretnesse. Tyr Contrary then to that which I haue sayde, The incest foule, and childbirth monstruous Of Iocasta, so stirres the wrath of Ioue, This citie shall with bloudy channels swimme, And angry Mars shall ouercome it all With famine, flame, rape, murther, dole and death: These lustie towres shall haue a headlong fall, These houses burnde, and all the rest be rasde, And soone be sayde, here whilome Thebes stoode. One onely way I finde for to escape, Which bothe would thee displease to heare it tolde, And me to tell percase were perillous. Thee therfore with my trauell I commende To Ioue, and with the rest I will endure, What so shall chaunce for our aduersitie. Cre. Yet stay a whyle. Tyr. Creon make me not stay By force. Cre. Why fleest thou? Tyr. Syr 'tis not fr? thee I flee, but from this fortune foule and fell. Cre. Yet tell me what behoues the citie doe? Tyr. Thou Creon seemest now desirous still It to preserue: but if as well as I Thou knewest that which is to thee vnknowne, Then wouldste thou not so soone consent therto. Cre. And would not I with eagre minde desire The thing that may for Thebes ought auayle? Tyr. And dost thou then so instantly request To know which way thou mayest the same preserue? Cre. For nothing else I sent my sonne of late To seeke for thee. Tyr. Then will I satisfie Thy greedie minde in this: but first tell me, Menetius where is he? Cre. Not farre from me. Tyr. I pray thee sende him out some other where. Cre. Why wouldest thou that he should not he here? Tyr. I would not haue him heare what I should say. Cre. He is my sonne, ne will he it reueale. Tyr. And shall I then while he is present speake? Cre. Yea, be thou sure that he no lesse than I, Doth wishe full well vnto this common weale. Tyr. Then Creon shalt thou knowe: the meane to saue This Citie, is, that thou shalt slea thy sonne, And of his bodie make a sacrifice For his Countrey: lo heere is all you seeke So muche to knowe, and since you haue me forst To tell the thing that I would not haue tolde, If I haue you offended with my words, Blame then your selfe, and eke your frowarde fate. Cre. cruell words, oh, oh, what hast thou sayde, Thou cruell southsayer? Tyr. Euen that, that heauen Hath ordeined once, and needes it must ensue. Cre. Howe many euils hast thou knit vp in one? Tyr. Though euill for thee, yet for thy countrey good. Cre. And let my countrey perishe, what care I? âTyr. Aboue all things we ought to holde it deare. Cre. Cruell were he, that would not loue his childe. âTyr. For c?m? weale, were well, that one man waile. Cre. To loose mine owne, I liste none other saue. âTyr.

That will I not: But in thy woe to yeelde thee some reliefe, I tell thee once, thou shalt be Lorde of Thebes, Which happe of thine this string did well declare, Which from the heart doth out alonely growe. So did the peece corrupted playnly shewe, An argument most euident to proue Thy sonne his death. Cre. Well, yet be thou content To keepe full close this secrete hidden griefe. Tyr. I neither ought, ne will keepe it so close. Cre. Shall I be then the murtherer of mine owne? Tyr. Ne blame not me, but blame the starres for this. Cre. Can heauens condemne but him alone to dye? Tyr.

Me. You rather ought, O father, to consent Unto my death, since that my death may bring Unto this towne bothe peace and victorie. âNe can I purchase more prayseworthy deathe âThan for my countreys wealth to lose my breath. Cre. I can not prayse this witlesse will of thine. âMe. You know deare father, that this life of ours âIs brittle, short, and nothing else in deede âBut tedious toyle and pangs of endlesse payne: âAnd death, whose darte to some men seemes so fell, âBrings quiet ende to this vnquiet life. âUnto which ende who soonest doth arriue, âFindes soonest rest of all his restlesse griefe. âAnd were it so, that here on earth we felte âNo pricke of payne, nor that our flattring dayes âWere neuer dasht by frowarde fortunes frowne, âYet beeing borne (as all men are) to dye, âWere not this worthy glory and renowne, âTo yeelde the countrey soyle where I was borne, âFor so long time, so shorte a time as mine? I can not thinke that this can be denied. Then if to shunne this haughtie highe behest, Mine onely cause, O father, doth you moue, Be sure, you seeke to take from me your sonne, The greatest honor that I can attayne: But if your owne commoditie you moue, So much the lesse you ought the same allowe: For looke, how much the more you haue in Thebes, So much the more you ought to loue the same: Here haue you Hemone, he that in my steade (O my deare father) may with you remaine, So that, although you be depriued of me, Yet shall you not be quite depriued of heires. Cre. I can not chuse, deare sonne, but disalowe This thy too hastie, hote desire of death: For if thy life thou settest all so lighte, Yet oughtest thou thy father me respect, Who as I drawe the more to lumpishe age, So much more neede haue I to craue thine ayde: Ne will I yet, with stubborne tong denye, âThat for his common weale to spende his life, âDoth win the subiect high renoumed name. âBut howe? in armoure to defende the state, âNot like a beast to bleede in sacrifice: And therewithall, if any should consent To such a death, then should the same be I, That haue prolonged life euen long enough, Ne many dayes haue I nowe to drawe on. And more auaile might to the countrie come, Deare sonne, to holde that lustie life of thine That arte both yong and eke of courage stout, Than may by me that feeble am and olde. Then liue deare sonne in high prosperitie, And giue me leaue that worthy am to dye. Mene. Yet worthy were not that vnworthy chaunge. Cre. If such a death bring glorie, giue it me, Mene. Not you, but me, the heauens cal to die. Cre. We be but one in flesh and body both. Mene. I father ought, so ought not you, to die. Cre.

Oh, fonde is he, who thinkes to vnderstand The mysteries of Ioue his secrete mynde: And for to ende this controuersie here, Loe thus I say, I will we both liue yet: Prepare thee then, my hestes to holde and keepe, And pull a downe that stubborne heart of thyne.

When she that rules the rolling wheele of chaunce, Doth turne aside hir angrie frowning face, On him, whom erst she deigned to aduaunce, She neuer leaues to galde him with disgrace, To tosse and turne his state in euery place, Till at the last she hurle him from on high And yeld him subiect vnto miserie: And as the braunche that from the roote is reft, He neuer winnes like life to that he lefte: Yea though he do, yet can no tast of ioy Compare with pangs that past in his annoy. Well did the heauens ordeine for our behoofe Necessitie, and fates by them allowde, That when we see our high mishappes aloofe (As though our eyes were mufled with a cloude) Our froward will doth shrinke it selfe and shrowde From our auaile, wherewith we runne so farre As none amends can make that we do marre: Then drawes euill happe &amp; striues to shew his str?gth, And such as yeld vnto his might, at length He leades them by necessitie the way That destinie preparde for our decay. The Mariner amidde the swelling seas Who seeth his barke with many a billowe beaten, Now here, now there, as wind and waues best please, When thundring Ioue with tempest list to threaten, And dreades in depest gulfe for to be eaten, Yet learnes a meane by mere necessitie To saue him selfe in such extremitie: For when he seeth no man hath witte nor powre To flie from fate when fortune list to lowre, His only hope on mightie Ioue doth caste, Whereby he winnes the wished hauen at last. How fond is that man in his fantasie, Who thinks that Ioue the maker of vs al, And he that tempers all in heauen on high, The sunne, the mone, the starres celestiall, So that no leafe without his leaue can fall, Hath not in him omnipotence also To guide and gouerne all things here below? O blinded eies, O wretched mortall wights, O subiect slaues to euery euill that lights, To scape such woe, such paine, such shame and scorne, Happie were he that neuer had bin borne. Well might duke Creon driuen by destinie, If true it be that olde Tyresias saith, Redeme our citie from this miserie, By his consent vnto Meneceus death, Who of him selfe wold faine haue lost his breth, âBut euery man is loth for to fulfill âThe heauenly hest that pleaseth not his will: âThat publique weale must needes to ruine go âWhere priuate profite is preferred so.

      <field name="fulltext">The order of the fourth dumbe shevve. Before the beginning of this fourth Acte, the Trumpets sounded, the drummes and fifes, and a greate peale of ordinaunce was shot of, in the which ther entred vpon the stage .vj. knights armed at al points, whereof three came in by the Gates ElectrÃ¦, and the other foure by the Gates Homoloides, either parte beeing accompanied with vij. other armed men: and after they had marched twice or thrice about the Stage, the one partie menacing the other by their furious lookes and gestures, the .vj. knights caused their other attendants to stand by, and drawing their Swords, fell to cruell and couragious combate, continuing therein, till two on the one side were slayne: the third perceiuing, that he only remayned to withstand the force of .iij. enemies, did politiquely runne aside, wherewith immediatly one of the .iij. followed after him, and when he hadde drawen his enimie thus from his companie, hee turned againe and slewe him: Then the seconde also ranne after him, whome he slewe in like m?ner, and consequently the thirde, and then triumphantly marched aboute the Stage with hys sword in his hand. Hereby was noted the incomparable force of concord betweene brethren, who as long as they holde togither may not easily by any meanes be ouercome, and being once disseuered by any meanes, are easily ouerthrowen. The history of the brethren Horatij &amp; Curiatij, who agreed to like combate and came to like ende.

Come forthe, O Queene, surceasse thy wofull plainte, And to my words vouchsafe a willing eare. The Queene vvith hir traine commeth out of hir Pallace. Ioca. My seruant deare, doest thou yet bring me newes Of more mishappe? ah werie wretch, alas, How doth Eteocles? whome heretofore In his encreasing yeares, I wonted ay From daungerous happe with fauoure to defend, Doth he yet liue? or hath vntimely death In cruell fight berefte his flowring life? Nun. He liues (O Queene) hereof haue ye no doubte, From such suspecte my selfe will quite you soone. Ioca. The v?trous Greekes haue haply tane the toune? Nun. The Gods forbid. Ioca. Our souldiers then, perchance, Dispersed bene and yelden to the sword. Nun. Not so, they were at first in daunger sure, But in the end obteined victorie. Ioca. Alas, what then bec?mes of Polinice? Oh canst thou tell? is he dead or aliue? Nun. You haue (O Queene) yet both your sonnes aliue. Ioca. Oh, how my harte is eased of this paine. Well, then proceede, and briefly let me heare, How ye repulst your proud presuming foes, That thereby yet at least I may assuage The swelling sorrowes in my dolefull brest, In that the towne is hitherto preserude: And for the rest, I trust that mightie Ioue Will yelde vs ayde. Nun. No soner had your worthy valiant sonne, Seuerde the Dukes into seauen seuerall partes, And set them to defence of seuerall gates, And brought in braue arraye his horssemen out, First to encounter with their mightie foen, And likewise pitcht, the footemen face to face Against the footemen of their enimies, But fiercely straight, the armies did approche, Swarming so thicke, as couerde cleane the fielde, When dreadfull blast of braying trumpets sounde, Of dolefull drummes, and thundring cannon shot, Gaue hideous signe of horrour of the fight, Then gan the Greekes to giue their sharpe assaulte, Then from the walls our stout couragious men, With rolling stones, with paisse of hugie beames, With flying dartes, with flakes of burning fire, And deadly blowes, did beate them backe againe: Thus striuing long, with stout and bloudie fighte, Whereby full many thousande slaughtered were, The hardie Greekes came vnderneath the walls, Of whome, first Capaney (a lustie Knight) Did scale the walls, and on the top thereof Did vaunt himselfe, when many hundred moe, With fierce assaultes did followe him as fast. Then loe, the Captaines seauen bestirrde themselues, (Whose names ye haue alreadie vnderstoode) Some here, some there, nought dreading losse of life, With newe reliefe to feede thee fainting breach: And Polinice, he bended all the force Of his whole charge, against the greatest gate, When sodenly a flashe of lightning flame From angrie skies strake captaine Capaney, That there downe dead he fell, at sight whereof The gazers one were fraught with soden feare. The rest, that stroue to mount the walles so fast, From ladders toppe did headlong tumble downe. Herewith our men encouragde by good happe, Toke hardy harts, and so repulst the Grekes. There was Eteocles and I with him, Who setting first those souldiers to their charge, Ranne streight to thother gates, vnto the weake He manly comforte gaue, vnto the bold His lusty words encreased courage still, In so much as th'amased Grecian king When he did heare of Capaney his death, Fearing thereby the Gods became his foen Out from the trench withdrewe his wearie host. But rashe Eteocles (presuming tootoo much Uppon their flight) did issue out of Thebes, And forwarde straighte with strength of chiualrie, His flying foes couragiously pursude. To long it were to make recompt of all That wounded bene, or slaine, or captiue now, The cloudy ayre was filled round aboute With houling cries and wofull wayling plaints: So great a slaughter (O renowmed Queene) Before this day I thinke was neuer seene. Thus haue we now cut of the fruitlesse hope The Grecians had, to sacke this noble towne. What ioyfull end will happen herevnto Yet know I not: the gods tourne all to good. âTo conquere, lo, is doubtlesse worthy praise, âBut wisely for to vse the conquest gotte, âHath euer wonne immortall sound of fame.

But yet proceede, and further let me know The finall ende that they agreed vpon. Nun. No more (O queene) let this for now suffise, Sith hitherto your state is safe inough. Ioca. These words of thine, do whelme my iealous mind With great suspecte of other mischiefes hidde. Nun. What would ye more, alredy being sure That both your sonnes in safetie do remaine? Ioca. I long to know the rest, or good or bad. Nun. O let me now retourne to Eteocles, That of my seruice greatly stands in neede. Ioca. Right well I see, thou doest conceale the woorst. Nun. Oh force me not, the good now beeing past, To tell the yll. Ioca. Tell it I say, on paine of our displeasure. Nun. Since thus ye seeke to heare a dolefull tale, I will no longer stay: witte ye therefore, Your desperate sonnes togither be agreed For to attempt a wicked enterprise, To priuate fight they haue betroutht themselues, Of which conflicte, the end must needes be this, That one do liue, that other die the death. Ioca. Alas, alas, this did I euer feare. Nun Now, sith in summe I haue reuealed that, Which you haue heard with great remorse of mind, I will proceede, at large to tell the whole. When your victorious sonne, with valiaunt force Had chast his foes into their ioyning tents, Euen there he staide, and straight at sound of trumpe With stretched voice the herault thus proclaimde: You princely Greekes, that hither be arriued To spoile the fruite of these our fertile fields, And vs to driue from this our Natiue soile, O suffer not so many giltlesse soules By this debate descend in Stigian lake, For priuate cause of wicked Pollinice, But rather let the brethren, hand to hand, By mutuall blowes appease their furious rage, And so to cease from sheding further bloud: And, to the end you all might vnderstand The profite that to euery side may fall, Thus much my Lord thought good to profer you, This is his will, if he be ouercome, Then Polinice to rule this kingly realme: If so it happe (as reason would it should) Our rightfull prince to conquere Polinice, That then no one of you make more adoo, But straight to Argos Ile hast home againe. This, thus pronounst vnto the noble Greeks, No soner did the sound of trumpet cease, But Polinice stept forth before the host, And to these words this answere did he make: O thou, (not brother) but my mortall foe, Thy profer here hath pleased me so well, As presently, without more long delay, I yeld my selfe prepared to the field. Our noble King no soner heard this vaunt, But forth as fast he prest his princely steppes, With eger mind, as hoouering falcon wonts To make hir stoope, when pray appeares in sight: At all assayes they both were brauely armed, To eithers side his sword fast being girt, In eithers hand was put a sturdy launce: About Eteocles our souldiers cloong, To comforte him, and put him then in mind, He fought for safetie of his country soile, And that in him consisted all their hope. To Polinice the king Adrastus swore, If he escaped victor from the fielde, At his retourn he would in Greece erecte A golden Image vnto mightie Ioue In signe of his triumphing victorie: But all this while seeke you (O noble queene) To hinder this your furious sonnes attempte. Intreat the Gods it may not take effecte, Els must you needes ere long depriued be Of both your sonnes, or of the one at least. Nuntius returneth to the camp by the gates Homoloides. IOCASTA. ANTIGONE. Antigone my swete daughter, come forth Out of this house, that nought but woe retaines, Come forth I say, not for to sing or daunce, But to preuent (if in our powers it lie) That thy malicious brethren (swolne with ire) And I alas, their miserable mother, Be not destroide by stroke of dreadfull death. Antigone commeth out of hir mothers Pallace. Anti. Ah swete mother, ah my beloued mother, Alas alas what cause doth moue ye now From trembling voice to send such carefull cries? What painefull pang? what griefe doth gripe you nowe? Ioca. O deare daughter, thy most vnhappie brethren That sometimes lodgde within these wretched loynes Shall die this daye, if Ioue preuent it not. Anti. Alas what say you? alas what do you say? Can I (alas) endure to see him dead, Whom I thus long haue sought to see aliue? Ioca. They both haue vowde (I quake alas to tell) With trenchant blade to spill ech others blood. O cruell Eteocles, ah ruthlesse wretch, Of this outrage thou only art the cause, Not Pollinice, whom thou with hatefull spight Hast reaued first of crowne and countrie soyle, And now doest seeke to reaue him of his life. Ioca. Daughter no more delay, lets go, lets go. Anti. Ah my sweete mother, whither shall I go? Ioca. With me, deere daughter, to the greekish host. Anti. Alas how can I go? vnles I go In daunger of my life, or of good name? Ioca. Time serues not now (my welbeloued childe) To way the losse of life or honest name, But rather to preuent (if so we may) That wicked deede, which only but to thinke, Doth hale my hart out of my heauie brest. Anti. Come then, lets go, good mother let vs go, But what shall we be able for to doe, You a weake old woman forworne with yeares, And I God knowes a silly simple mayde? Ioca. Our wofull wordes, our prayers &amp; our plaintes, Pourde out with streames of ouerflowing teares, (Where Nature rules) may happen to preuayle, When reason, power, and force of armes do fayle. But if the glowing heate of boyling wrath So furious be, as it may not relent, Then I atwixt them both will throw my selfe, And this my brest shall beare the deadly blowes That otherwise should light vpon my sonnes: So shall they shead my bloud and not their owne. Well now deere daughter, let vs hasten hence, For if in time we stay this raging strife, Then haply may my life prolonged be: If ere we come the bloudy deede be done, Then must my ghost forsake this feeble corps: And thou, deare childe, with dolour shalt bewaile, Thy brothers death and mothers all at once. Iocasta vvith Antigone, and all hir traine (excepte the Chorus) goeth tovvards the campe, by the gates Homoloydes. CHORVS. Who so hath felt, what feruent loue A mother beares vnto hir tender sonnes, She and none other sure, can comprehende The dolefull griefe, the pangs and secret paine, That presently doth pierce the princely brest Of our afflicted Queene: alas, I thinke No martyrdome might well compare with hirs. So ofte as I recorde hir restlesse state, Alas me thinkes I feele a shiuering feare Flit to and fro along my flushing vaines. Alas for ruth, that thus two brethren shoulde, Enforce themselues to shed each others bloude. Where is the lawes of nature nowe become? Can fleshe of fleshe, alas, can bloude of bloude, So far forget it selfe, as slaye it selfe? O lowring starres, O dimme and angrie skies, O giltie fate, such mischiefe set aside. But if supernall powers decreed haue, That death must be the ende of this debate, Alas what floudes of teares shall then suffise, To weepe and waile the neare approching death: I meane the death of sonnes and mother both, And with their death the ruine and decay, Of Oedipus and all his princely race? But loe, here Creon c?mes with carefull cheare. Tis time that nowe I ende my iust complaint. Creon commeth in by the gates Homoloydes. CREON NVNCIVS. Although I straightly chargde my tender childe To flie from Thebes for safegarde of hymselfe, And that long since he parted from my sight, Yet doe I greatly hang in lingring doubt, Least passing through the gates, the priuie watch Hath stayed him by some suspect of treason. And so therewhile, the prophetes hauing skride His hidden fate, he purchast haue the death Which I by all meanes sought he might eschewe: And this mischaunce so much I feare the more, Howe much the wished conquest at the first, Fell happily vnto the towne of Thebes. âBut wise men ought with patience to sustaine âThe sundrie haps that slipperie fortune frames. Nuncius commeth in by the gates ElectrÃ¦. Nun. Alas, who can direct my hastie steppes Unto the brother of our wofull Queene? But loe where carefully he standeth here. Cre. If so the minde maye dreade his owne mishap, Then dread I much, this man that seekes me thus, Hath brought the death of my beloued sonne. Nun. My Lorde, the thing you feare is very true, Your sonne Meneceus no longer liues. Cre. Alas who can withstande the heauenly powers? Well, it beseems not me, ne yet my yeares, In bootelesse plaint to wast my wailefull teares: Do thou recount to me his lucklesse deathe, The order, fourme, and manner of the same. Nun. Your sonne (my Lorde) came to Eteocles, And tolde him this in presence of the rest, Renoumed King, neither your victorie, Ne yet the safetie of this princely Realme In armour doth consist, but in the death Of me, of me, (O most victorious King) So heauenly dome of mightie Ioue commaunds, I (knowing what auayle my death should yeeld Unto your grace, and vnto natiue land) Might well be deemde a most vngratefull sonne Unto this worthy towne, if I would shunne The sharpest death to do my countrie good, In mourning weede nowe let the vestall Nimphes, With fauning tunes commende my faultlesse ghost To highest heauens, while I despoyle my selfe, That afterwarde (sith Ioue will haue it so) To saue your liues, I may receyue my death. Of you I craue, O curteous Citizens, To shrine my corps in tombe of marble stone, Whereon graue this: Meneceus here doth lie, For countries cause that vvas content to die. This saide, alas, he made no more a doe, But drewe his sworde and sheathde it in his brest. Cre. No more, I haue inough, returne ye nowe From whence ye came. Nuncius retourneth by the gates ElectrÃ¦. Well, since the bloude of my beloued sonne, Must serue to slake the wrathe of angrie Ioue, And since his onely death must bring to Thebes A quiet ende of hir vnquiet state, Me thinkes good reason would, that I henceforth Of Thebane soyle shoulde beare the kingly swaye, Yea sure, and so I will ere it be long, Either by right, or else by force of armes. Of al mishap loe here the wicked broode, My sister first espoused hath hir sonne That slewe his sire, of whose accursed seede Two brethren sprang, whose raging hatefull hearts, By force of boyling yre are bolne so sore As each do thyrst to sucke the others bloude: But why do I sustaine the smart hereof? Why should my bloud be spilte for others gilte? Oh welcome were that messanger to me That brought me word of both my nephewes deathes, Then should it soone be sene in euery eye, Twixt prince and prince what difference would appeare, Then should experience shewe what griefe it is To serue the humours of vnbridled youth. Now will I goe for to prepare with speede The funeralls of my yong giltlesse sonne, The which perhaps may be accompanyed With thobsequies of proude Eteocles. Creon goeth out by the gates Homoloydes. CHORVS. O Blisfull concord, bredde in sacred brest Of him that guides the restlesse rolling sky, That to the earth for mans assured rest From heigth of heauens vouchsafest downe to flie, In thee alone the mightie power doth lie, With swete accorde to kepe the frouning starres And euery planet else from hurtfull warres. In thee, in thee suche noble vertue bydes, As may commaund the mightiest Gods to bend, From thee alone such sugred frendship slydes As mortall wightes can scarcely comprehend, To greatest strife thou setst delightfull ende. O holy peace, by thee are onely founde The passing ioyes that euery where abound. Thou onely thou, through thy celestiall might, Didst first of all the heauenly pole deuide, From th'olde confused heape that Chaos hight: Thou madest the Sunne, the Moone, and starres to glide, With ordred course about this world so wide: Thou hast ordainde Dan Tytans shining light, By dawne of day to chase the darkesome night. When tract of time returnes the lustie Uer, By thee alone, the buddes and blossomes spring, The fieldes with floures be garnisht euery where, The blooming trees, aboundant fruite do bring, The cherefull birdes melodiously do sing, Thou dost appoint, the crop of sommers seede For mans reliefe, to serue the winters neede. Thou dost inspire the hearts of princely peeres By prouidence, proceeding from aboue, In flowring youth to choose their worthie feeres, With whom they liue in league of lasting loue, Till fearefull death doth flitting life remoue: And loke how fast, to death man payes his due, So fast againe, dost thou his stocke renue. By thee, the basest thing aduaunced is, Thou euerie where, dost graffe suche golden peace, As filleth man, with more than earthly blisse, The earth by thee, doth yelde hir swete increase At becke of thee, all bloudy discords cease, And mightiest Realmes in quiet do remaine, Wheras thy hand, doth holde the royall raigne. But if thou faile, then all things gone to wracke, The mother then, doth dread hir naturall childe, Then euery towne is subiect to the sacke, Then spotlesse maids, then virgins be defilde, Then rigor rules, then reason is exilde: And this, thou wofull Thebes, to our great paine, With present spoile, art likely to sustaine. Me thinke I heare the wailfull weeping cries Of wretched dames, in euerie coast resound, Me thinkes I see, how vp to heauenly skies From battered walls, the thundring clappes rebound Me thinke I heare, how all things go to ground, Me thinke I see, how souldiers wounded lye With gasping breath, and yet they can not dye. By meanes wherof, oh swete Meneceus he, That giues for countries cause his guiltlesse life, Of others all, most happy shall he be: His ghost shall flit, from broiles of bloudy strife, To heauenly blisse, where pleasing ioyes be rife: And would to God, that this his fatall ende From further plagues, our citie might defend. O sacred God, giue eare vnto thy thrall, That humbly here vpon thy name doth call, O let not now, our faultlesse bloud be spilt, For hote reuenge of any others gilt. Finis Actus quarti. Done by F.

Nun. Then know my Lorde, the battell that begonne Under the walles, was brought to luckie ende, Eteocles had made his foemen flee Within their trenches, to their foule reproche: But herewithall the bretheren streightway Eche other chalenge foorth into the fielde, By combate so to stinte their cruell strife, Who armed thus amid the field appeard. First Pollinices turning towarde Greece His louely lookes, gan Iuno thus beseeche: O heauenly queene, thou seest, that since the day I first did wedde Adrastus daughter deare, And stayde in Greece, thy seruaunt haue I bene: Then (be it not for mine vnworthinesse) Graunt me this grace, the victorie to winne, Graunt me, that I with high triumphant hande, May bathe this blade within my brothers brest: I know I craue vnworthy victorie, Unworthy triumphes, and vnworthy spoyles, Lo he the cause, my cruell enimie. The people wept to heare the wofull wordes Of Pollinice, foreseeing eke the ende Of this outrage and cruell combate tane, Eche man gan looke vpon his drouping mate, With mindes amazde, and trembling hearts for dread, Whom pitie perced f or these youthfull knightes. Eteocles with eyes vp cast to heauen, Thus sayde: O mightie Ioue his daughter graunt to me, That this right hande with this sharpe armed launce Passing amid my brothers cankred brest, It may eke pierce that cowarde harte of his, And so him slea that thus vnworthily Disturbes the quiet of our common weale. So sayde Eteocles, and trumpets blowne, To sende the summons of their bloudy fighte, That one the other fiercely did encounter, Like Lions two yfraught with boyling wrath, Bothe coucht their launces full agaynst the face, But heauen it nolde that there they should them teinte: Upon the battred shields the mightie speares Are bothe ybroke, and in a thousande shiuers Amid the ayre flowne vp into the heauens: Beholde agayne, with naked sworde in hande, Eche one the other furiously assaultes. Here they of Thebes, there stoode the Greekes in doubt, Of whom doth eche man feele more chilling dread, Least any of the twayne should lose his life, Than any of the twayne did feele in fight. Their angry lookes, their deadly daunting blowes, Might witnesse well, that in their heartes remaynde As cankred hate, disdayne, and furious moode, As euer bred in beare or tygers brest. The first that hapt to hurt was Polinice. Who smote the righte thighe of Eteocles: But as we deeme, the blow was nothing deepe, Then cryed the Greekes, and lepte with lightned harts, But streight agayne they helde their peace, for he Eteocles gan thrust his wicked sworde In the lefte arme of vnarmed Pollinice, And let the bloud from thinne vnfenced fleshe With falling drops distill vpon the ground, Ne long he stayes, but with an other thrust His brothers belly boweld with his blade, Then wretched he, with bridle left at large, From of his horsse fell pale vpon the ground, Ne long it was, but downe our duke dismountes From of his startling steede, and runnes in hast, His brothers haplesse helme for to vnlace, And with such hungry minde desired spoyle, As one that thought the fielde already woonne: That at vnwares, his brothers dagger drawne, And griped fast within the dying hand, Under his side he recklesse doth receiue, That made the way to his wyde open hart: Thus falles Eteocles his brother by, From both whose breasts the bloud fast bubling, gaue A sory shewe to Greekes and Thebanes both. Cho. Oh wretched ende of our vnhappie Lordes. Cre. Oh Oedipus, I must bewaile the death Of thy deare sonnes, that were my nephewes both, But of these blowes thou oughtest feele the smarte, That with thy wonted prayers, thus hast brought Such noble blouds to this vnnoble end. But now tell on, what followed of the Queene? Nun. Wh? thus with pierced harts, by there owne hands The brothers fell had wallowed in their bloud, Th'one tumbling on the others gore, Came their afflicted mother, then to late, And eke with hir, hir chast childe Antygone, Who saw no sooner how their fates had falne, But with the doubled echo of alas, Sore dymmde the ayre with loude complaints and cryes: Oh sonnes (quod she) too late came all my helpe, And all to late haue I my succour sent: And with these wordes, vpon their carcas colde She shriched so, as might haue stayed the Sunne To mourne with hir, the wofull sister eke, That both hir chekes did bathe in flowing teares, Out from the depth of hir tormented brest, With scalding sighes gan draw these weary words: O my deare brethren, why abandon ye Our mother deare, when these hir aged yeares, That of themselues are weake and growne with griefe, Stoode most in neede of your sustaining helpe? Why doe you leaue hir thus disconsolate? At sounde of such hir weeping long lament, Eteocles our king helde vp his hand, And sent from bottome of his wofull brest A doubled sighe, deuided with his griefe, In faithfull token of his feeble will To recomfort his mother and sister both: And in the steade of sweete contenting words, The trickling teares raynde downe his paled chekes: Then claspt his handes, and shut his dying eyes. But Pollinice, that turned his rolling eyen Unto his mother and his sister deare, With hollow voyce and fumbling toung, thus spake: Mother, you see how I am now arryued Unto the hauen of myne vnhappie ende, Now nothing doth remaine to me, but this, That I lament my sisters life and yours Left thus in euerlasting woe and griefe: So am I sory for Eteocles, Who though he were my cruell enimy, He was your sonne, and brother yet to me: But since these ghosts of ours must needes go downe With staggering steppes into the Stigian reigne, I you beseche, mother and sister bothe, Of pitie yet, that you will me procure A royall tombe within my natiue realme, And now shut vp with those your tender handes, These grieffull eyes of mine, whose daseled sight Shadowes of dreadfull death be come to close, Now rest in peace, this sayde, he yeelded vp His fainting ghost, that ready was to part. The mother thus beholding both hir sonnes Ydone to death, and ouercome with dole, Drewe out the dagger of hir Pollinices, From brothers brest, and gorde hir mothers throte Falling betweene hir sonnes, Then with hir feebled armes, she doth enfolde Their bodies both, as if for company Hir vncontented corps were yet content To passe with them in Charons ferrie boate. When cruell fate had thus with force bereft The wofull mother and hir two deare sonnes, All sodenly allarme allarme they crye, And hote conflict began for to aryse Betwene our armie and our enemyes: For either part would haue the victorye. A while they did with equall force maintaine The bloudy fight, at last the Greekes do flie, Of whom could hardly any one escape, For in such hugie heapes our men them slew, The ground was couerde all with carcases: And of our souldiers, some gan spoyle the dead, Some other were that parted out the pray, And some pursuing Antigone toke vp The Queene Iocasta and the brethren both, Whom in a chariot hither they will bring Ere long: and thus, although we gotten haue The victory ouer our enemies, Yet haue we lost much more than we haue wonne.

Thy sonne our king not long before his death Assigned hath the kingdome should descende To me, that am his mothers brother borne, And so the same might to my sonne succeede. Now I that am the lorde and king of Thebes, Will not permit that thou abide therein: Ne maruell yet of this my heady will, Ne blame thou me, for why, the heauens aboue, Which onely rule the rolling life of man, Haue so ordeynde, and that my words be true, Tyresias he that knoweth things to come, By trustie tokens hath foretolde the towne, That while thou didst within the walles remayne, It should be plagued still with penurie: Wherfore departe, and thinke not that I speake These wofull wordes for hate I beare to thee, But for the weale of this afflicted realme. [Oed.] O foule accursed fate, that hast me bredde To beare the burthen of the miserie Of this colde death, which we accompt for life: Before my birth my father vnderstoode I should him slea, and scarcely was I borne, When he me made a pray for sauage beastes. But what? I slew him yet, then caught the crowne, And last of all defilde my mothers bedde, By whom I haue this wicked ofspring got: And to this heinous crime and filthy facte The heauens haue from highe enforced me, Agaynst whose doome no counsell can preuayle. Thus hate I now my life, and last of all, Lo by the newes of this so cruell death Of bothe my sonnes and deare beloued wife, Mine angrie constellation me commaundes Withouten eyes to wander in mine age, When these my weery, weake, and crooked limmes Haue greatest neede to craue their quiet rest. O cruell Creon, wilt thou slea me so, For cruelly thou doste but murther me, Out of my kingdome now to chase me thus: Yet can I not with humble minde beseeche Thy curtesie, ne fall before thy feete. Let fortune take from me these worldly giftes, She can not conquere this couragious heart, That neuer yet could well be ouercome, To force me yeelde for feare to villanie: Do what thou canst I will be Oedipus. Cre. So hast thou reason Oedipus, to say, And for my parte I would thee counsell eke, Still to maynteine the high and hawtie minde, That hath bene euen in thy noble heart: For this be sure, if thou wouldst kisse these knees, And practise eke by prayer to preuayle, No pitie coulde persuade me to consent That thou remayne one onely houre in Thebes.

If neede require, with him eke will I dye. Cre. Depart, depart, and with thy father dye, Rather than kill my childe with bloudie knife: Go hellishe monster, go out of the towne. Creon exit. Oedi. Daughter, I must commend thy noble heart. Anti. Father, I will neuer come in company And you alone wander in wildernesse. Oedi. O yes deare daughter, leaue thou me alone Amid my plagues: be mery while thou maist. Anti. And who shall guide these aged feete of yours, That banisht bene, in blind necessitie? Oedi. I will endure, as fatall lot me driues, Resting these crooked sory sides of mine Where so the heauens shall lend me harborough. And in exchange of riche and stately toures, The woodes, the wildernesse, the darkesome dennes Shalbe the bowre of mine vnhappy bones. Anti. O father, now where is your glory gone? âOedi. One happy day did raise me to renoune, âOne haplesse day hath throwne mine honor downe. Anti. Yet will I beare a part of your mishappes. Oedi. That sitteth not amid thy pleasant yeares. âAnti. Deare father yes, let youth giue place to age. Oedi. Where is thy mother? let me touche hir face, That with these hands I may yet feele the harme That these blind eyes forbid me to beholde. Anti. Here father, here hir corps, here put your hand, Oedi. O wife, O mother, O both wofull names, O wofull mother, and O wofull wyfe, O woulde to God, alas, O woulde to God Thou nere had bene my mother, nor my wyfe. But where lye nowe the paled bodies two, Of myne vnluckie sonnes, Oh where be they? Anti. Lo here they lye one by an other deade. Oedip. Stretch out this hand, dere daughter, stretch this hande Upon their faces. Anti. Loe father, here, lo, nowe you touche them both. Oedi. O bodies deare, O bodies dearely boughte Unto your father, bought with high missehap. Anti. O louely name of my deare Pollinice, Why can I not of cruell Creon craue, Ne with my death nowe purchase thee a graue? Oedi. Nowe commes Apollos oracle to passe, That I in Athens towne should end my dayes: And since thou doest, O daughter myne, desire In this exile to be my wofull mate, Lende mee thy hande, and let vs goe togither. Anti. Loe, here all prest my deare beloued father, A feeble guyde, and eke a simple skowte, To passe the perills in a doubtfull waye. Oedi. Unto the wretched, be a wretched guyde. Anti. In this all onely equall to my father. Oedi. And where shall I sette foorth my trembling feete? O reache mee yet some surer staffe, to staye My staggryng pace amidde these wayes vnknowne. Anti. Here father here, and here set forth your feete. Oedi. Nowe can I blame none other for my harmes But secrete spight of foredecreed fate, Thou arte the cause, that crooked, olde and blynde, I am exilde farre from my countrey soyle, A nd suffer dole that I myghte not endure. âAnti. O father, father, Iustice lyes on sleepe, âNe doth regarde the wrongs of wretchednesse, âNe princes swelling pryde it doth redresse. Oedi. O carefull caytife, howe am I nowe chang'd From that I was? I am that Oedipus, That whylome had triumphant victorie, And was bothe dread and honored eke in Thebes: But nowe (so pleaseth you my frowarde starres) Downe headlong hurlde in depth of myserie, So that remaynes of Oedipus no more As nowe in mee, but euen the naked name, And lo, this image, that resembles more Shadowes of death, than shape of Oedipus. Antig. O father, nowe forgette the pleasaunt dayes And happie lyfe that you did whylom leade, The muse whereof redoubleth but your griefe: Susteyne the smarte of these your present paynes With pacience, that best may you preserue. Lo where I come, to liue and die with you, Not (as sometymes) the daughter of a king, But as an abiect nowe in pouertie, That you, by presence of suche faithfull guide, May better beare the wracke of miserie. Oedi. O onely comforte of my cruell happe. Anti. Your daughters pitie is but due to you: Woulde God I might as well ingraue the corps Of my deare Pollinice, but I ne maye, And that I can not, doubleth all my dole. Oedi. This thy desire, that is both good and iuste, Imparte to some that be thy trustie frendes, Who moude with pitie, maye procure the same. âAnti. Beleeue me father, when dame fortune frownes, âBe fewe that fynde trustie companions. Oedi. And of those fewe, yet one of those am I: Wherefore, goe we nowe daughter, leade the waye Into the stonie rockes and highest hilles, Where fewest trackes our steppings may be spyde. âWho once hath sit in chaire of dignitie, âMay shame to shewe him selfe in miserie. Anti. From thee, O countrey, am I forst to parte, Despoyled thus in floure of my youth, And yet I leaue within mine enimies rule Ismene my infortunate sister. Oed. Deare Citizens, beholde your lorde and king That Thebes set in quiet gouernement, Nowe as you see, neglected of you all, And in these ragged ruthfull weedes bewrapt, Ychased from his natiue countrey soyle, Betakes him selfe (for so this Tyraunt will) To euerlasting banishment: but why Do I lament my lucklesse lotte in vayne? âSince euery man must beare with quiet minde, âThe fate that heauens haue earst to him assignde. CHORVS. Example here, lo take by Oedipus, You kings and princes in prosperitie, And euery one that is desirous To sway the seate of worldly dignitie, How fickle is to trust in fortunes wheele: For him, whom now she hoyseth vp on hye, If so he chaunce on any side to reele, She hurles him downe in twinkling of an eye: And him agayne, that grouleth now on grounde, And lyeth lowe in dungeon of dispaire, Hir whirling wheele can heaue vp at a bounde, And place aloft in stay of stately chaire. As from the Sunne the Moone withdrawes hir face, So might of man dothe yeelde dame fortune place. Finis Actus quinti.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogus. Lo here the fruite of high aspiring minde, Who weeues to mount aboue the mouing skies: Lo here the trappe that titles proud do finde, See, ruine growes when most we reache to ryse: Sweete is the name, and stately is the raigne Of kingly rule, and sway of royall seate, But bitter is the taste of Princes gayne, When climbing heads do hunte for to be great. Who would forecast the banke of restlesse toyle, Ambitious wightes do fraight their brestes withall, The growing cares, the feares of dreadfull foyle, The euill successe that on suche flightes do fall, He would not stayne his practise to atchiue The largest limites of the mightiest states. But oh, what fansies sweete do still relieue The hungry humor of these swelling hates? What poyson sweete inflameth highe desire? How soone the hawty heart is puft with pride? How soone is thirst of scepter set on fire? How soone in rising mindes doth mischiefe slyde? What bloudy sturres doth glut of honour breede? Thambitious sonne doth ofte surpresse his syre: Where natures power vnfayned loue should spread, There malice raynes and reacheth to be higher. O blinde vnbridled searche of Soueraintie, O tickle trayne of euill attayned state, O fonde desire of princely dignitie, Who climbs too soone, he ofte repents too late. The golden meane the happie dothe suffise, They leaue the posting day in rare delight, They fill (not feede) their vncontented eyes, They reape suche rest as dothe begile the might, They not enuie the pompe of haughtie reigne, Ne dreade the dinte of proude vsurping swoorde, But plaste alowe, more sugred ioyes attaine, Than swaye of loftie Scepter can afoorde. Cease to aspire then, cease to soare so high, And shunne the plague that pierceth noble breastes: To glittring courtes what fondnesse is to flee, When better state in baser Towers rests?
