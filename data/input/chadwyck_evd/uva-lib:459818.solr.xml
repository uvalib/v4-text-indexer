      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Through our last Age has been no Prologue us'd, In which the Audience have not been abus'd; As if the Poet in a railing Way Shou'd beg you, for the Profit of his Play, To come and be call'd Fools on his Third Day. Ours here, by sad Experience grown more wise, Having an empty House before his Eyes, Resolves to be more Civil than the rest, And will not lose a Friend to break a Jest. I told him well writ Satyr wholsome was; And that no worthy Man would break the Glass, That shew'd him handsomely his homely Face. He answer'd, 'twas the Vice of all Mankind To be to their own Imperfections blind. Hump Backs, says he, seem straight to your Town Beau's; The Olive colour'd Phyz, and pimpled Nose, Like Lilies fair, tho' blushing like a Rose. Let Errors ne're so much themselves display, You'l bear no Lenten Lecture in a Play; But hating Satyr leave us in the Lurch, And shun the Play-house, as you do the Church; Severely cry the Poets Labour down, That shows you Vices, too much like your own. How oft have I a sullen Critick seen, Chewing the Cud of an insipid Spleen, That seem'd to say—in troth that Scenes well writ; But I won't like it to be thought a Wit: Good natur'd Judgment seldom is prevailing, There's nothing shews a Man of Parts like Railing. To all compos'd of Courtly Critick Mold These truths must never be at all times told: Plain Dealing's rude, and will provoke their Spight To hiss, like Butchers, when they take delight, To set two snarling Bull-dogs on to bite. Ah, Sirs, this was not your Forefathers Way, When Cloak and Ruff sat snug at a long Play: Actors ne're gave, nor Audience took, offence; What ere could make 'em laugh, was solid Sence. But now you'l scarce stay out one Play in Ten; Nay faith, whats worst, take your half Crowns agen: A barbarous Custome that, almost as bad As your old Hectoring customary Trade, Of giving Chloris for her use ten Pound; Then beating the poor Jade, till she refund. Our Poet then imploring the old way, Intreats you to be civil to his Play, And not at all times show your selves severe But feast for once on solemn Lenten Fare. He shows the Miseries of Marriage forct, Of all Estates in humane Life the worst: A Heroe murder'd too, a Man as brave, As Heaven yet ere to bless a Nation gave: Wit, Justice, Valour, all his Fame advance; And has no fault, but that he comes from France.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. Enter Tamira and Teresia. Tam. Oh, preach no more of Patience, good Teresia! This reverent Counsel and religious Argument I know with Reason would inspire a Heart, That had less knowledge of the Pangs of Love: But I (alass!) have no Religion left, My stupid Soul now wants that Influence, That lately with true Joy inspir'd my Bosome, Where gloomy Sorrows only take possession. Ter. Well, well, still I say, you must have Patience, Let the Snail creep, if it cannot fly; leave off This whining and follow my Instructions, and I tell you once more, you shall have Comfort. Tam. Get me my Freedom then, Unty that knot, that fatal Marriage Band, That Parents Cruelty impos'd upon me, Forcing me from the Arms of dear D' Ambois, To be an Offering to Mountsurry's Wealth: Free me from this, and I'le be all Obedience; I'le hear, I'le vow, I'le pray with more Devotion, Than ever Penitent did to purchase Heaven. Ter. Why there 'tis now, I must get you your Freedom, I must unty the knot, ods precious d' ye make a Death of me already? 'tis true indeed you Have worn me to mere skin and bones; I Have pray'd and pray'd, till I have pray'd my Self into a Consumption about you, and yet I am not quite dead, and nothing but Death Can unty Marriages that I know. Tam. Nor nought but Hell contrive to tye so fast. All other Beings may find some Relief: The wretched Slave, that tugs the painful Oar, Lives still in hopes, he once may get his Freedom. Th'unhappy Merchant toss'd in stormy Winds, I'th'midst of Clouds and all tempestuous Dangers, Shrugs himself up in hopes to find a Calm, When safe he may behold the cheerful Sun. Even Vegetives all feel this Influence: The wrinkled Face of our dear Mother Earth, That Winter furrows with its nipping Frosts, Smiles at th'approach of the Springs youthful God, And decks her wither'd Brow with Buds, and Flowers. All things may have redress, but those that marry: Even Death relieves not us, till 'tis too late. Were I to torture one I wisht were dead, To load her with a Curse, I'de bid her Wed. Ter. 'Gad forgive me, why did you doe it then? I'me sure 'Twas without my Advice: I have told you many and Many a fair time, a Womans Conscience may be Satisfied like a good Christian, without going to a Priest. for a Conjugal Hoop to bind her to her Good Behaviour: besides, was it not done with your Consent? Did you not give your Heart? Tam. I give my Heart! No, all the Saints can witness not one grain, Or atome on't; or less, if less can be: I give my Heart! alass, I had no Heart, No Will, no Sence; was fatally distracted, Tortur'd, and teiz'd by Misers, call'd Relations; Stark mad, they bid me Sign my Death, I did it; And the unhappy Church-man that stood by To joyn our Hands was sure as mad as I. Ter. If he had stript you both, and clapt Breast to Breast, That your Hearts might have joyned, he had cone Wiser; for my part I never liked that old Custom of joyning Hands, there's no luck in't; I made my Daughter Cons joyn Feet with her Husband. Tam. Wou'd I had joyned my self to Death, then sure I had been happy. Ter. Nay, nay, not a word more of Death, if thou Lovest me; thou hast yet a great deal to do With the things of this World, Child: Come, come, I know you have been much distrest by Fortune; I know too you loved, and were betroth'd to D' Ambois, One that, to say truth, was a Man every Inch Of him: nay, to do him Justice, the Gentleman Wanted no parts to recommend him, but that he was poor. Tam. Poorer perhaps for me. Too well I know his riotous Expences: To court me in the dawning of our Love, What Masques, what Rovels, what triumphant Shews, Were still address'd! nor will I be ungrateful. Here, take this purse, prythee seek him out; I hear he shuns Converse and Company, Hates the bright Sun, that smiles upon his Sorrows, And wishes he and that might set for ever. Oh! seek him out, and with thy kindest phrase Assure him of my Friendship, Ter. Well, I hear you, but what says my Prayer book To this? Sure these grateful Actions come all under The notion of Charity! 'tis all Charity; come, set Your heart at rest, the Gentleman shall know the Good Will you bear him. Tam. It may be he'll desire to speak with me, For all wrong'd Lovers still have much to say: If so, then take this Secret; there's a Trap-door To a dark Vault that opens in my Apartment, Which to my Husband never yet was known; To clear his Doubts for once I'le there admit him, Without offence to Conjugal Obligements. Ter. Poor Heart, how fearful she is of offending! Well, I'le go to the Church, and pray for a Blessing Upon my Endeavours, and then I'le try what I Can do to bring you together: It shall go hard But your Scruple shall be satisfied; I think I am bound in Conscience to take care of your Scruple. Come, come, cheer up, at night expect an Answer, I'le about it instantly. [Exit. Tam. That he was Poor, there lies the fatal Plague, That murders Peace, and breaks poor Lovers Hearts. Oh, she is damn'd into the inmost Hell, That breaks a solemn Vow or holy Contract, For Int'rest, or her Lovers being poor. That there's a Nobleness i'th'midst of Want Appears by some Mens Actions; for as we see Mean Habits gracefully adorning some, Whilst others look like Asses in Embroidery: So a brave Man shines out in spight of Poverty. His Mind is great, though scanty be his Store, 'Tis he, that wants the Soul to give, is Poor. [Exit. SCENE. II. A Grove. Enter D' Ambois poorly habited. D' Ambois. Fortune, not Reason rules the State of things; Reward goes backwards, Honour on its head: Who is not poor, is monstrous; only Need Gives Form and Worth to every humane Seed. As Cedars beaten with continual Storms, So great Men flourish, and do imitate Unskilful Statuaries, that suppose In frameing a Colossus, if they make him Stroddle enough, strut, and look big and gape, Their Work is goodly; So Men meerly great, In their affected Gravity of Voice, Sourness of Countenance, Manners, Cruelty, Authority, Wealth, and all the Spawn of Fortune, Think, they bear all the Kingdomes worth before 'em; Yet differ not from those Colossick Statues. Man is a Torch borne in the Wind, a Dream, But of a Shaddow, sum'd with all his Substance, And as great Seamen, using all their Studies, And Skils in Neptunes deep invisible Paths, In stout Ships richly built, and rib'd with Brass, Do put a bridle round about the World; When they have done it, coming near their Haven, Are fain to give a Warning-piece, and call A poor stai'd Fisherman, that never past His Countrys Sight, so waft, and guide 'em in. So when we wander farthest through the Waves Of glassy Glory and the Gulphs of State, Topt with all Titles, spreading all our Reaches, As if each private Arm wou'd sphere the Earth, We must to Virtue for our Guide resort, Or we shall shipwrack in our safest Port. Enter Monsieur, and Page. Mons. Since there's no second Place in Sovereign State, I stand but as a Cypher; in a King All Places are contain'd, his Words and Looks Are like the Flashes and the Bolts of Jove; His Deeds inimitable, as the Sea, That uncontrolable still ebbs and flows: There's but a Thread, betwixt me and a Crown, I should not wish it cut, unless by Nature: Yet to prepare me for that possible Fortune, 'Tis good to get resolved Spirits about me. I follow'd D' Ambois to this green Retreat, A Man of Courage beyond the reach of Fear, Who discontent with his neglected Worth, Abhors the Light, and seeks obscure Abodes. But he is young, and haughty, apt to take Fire at Advancement, to bear State, and flourish; In his Rise therefore shall my Bounty shine, And make his Pride, first Step to my Design, What! D' Ambois! D' Ambois. He, Sir. Mons. Turn'd to Earth alive! Up man, the Sun shines on thee. D' Ambois. Let it shine, I am no Mote to play in't, as great Men are. Mons. Call'st thou Men great in Place Motes in the Sun? They say so, that wou'd have thee freeze in Shades. Who wou'd believe thy Metal cou'd be sloth, Rust and consume? If Themistocles Had liv'd obscure thus in the State of Athens, Xerxes had made both it and him his Slaves. If brave Camillus had lurkt so in Rome, He had not five times been Dictator there, Nor four times Triumpht. D' Ambois. What wou'd you have me do? Mons. Leave the troubled Streams, And live with Thrivers at the Fountain head. D' Ambois. The Fountain head! alass, what shou'd I do With that inchanted Glass? see Devils there? Or like a Strumpet learn to set my Looks, To please the gaudy Court, and practise Jugling? Keep a Slaves double Tongue, and double Heart? Flatter great Lords, to put 'em still in mind, Why they were made Lords? or please humourous Ladies, With Apish Cringes? tell 'em wanton Tales, To make their Physick work? spend a Mans Life In Sighs, and Visitations, that will make His Eyes as hollow as his Mistress Heart? Do no good, but to those that have no need, But gain being forward, tho' your break for hast All the Commandments e're you break your Fast? Shall I learn this there? Mons. No, thou need'st not learn, Thou hast the Theory, go there and Practise. D' Ambois. Yes, in a thread-bare Suite: when Men come there They must have high Naps, and go from thence bare. A Man may drown the parts of ten brave Men In one poor Suit; fine Show and outward Gloss Attract Court Loves, Merit has no Friend there. Mons. Thou sha't have Gloss enough, and all things fit, To free from this dull Cloud thy smother'd Spirit; Be rul'd by me then. Th'antient Scythians Painted blind Fortunes powerfull Hand with Wings, To shew her Gifts come swift and suddainly; Which if her Favourite be not swift to take, He loses them for ever; then be wise, Stay but a while hear, and I'le send to thee. Exit Mons. D' Ambois. What will he send, some Gold? It is to sow upon my Spirits, and make't spring a Crown Worth Millions of the Seed Crowns he will send; For well I know the height of his Ambition. O Providence, how sacred are thy Orders, That this great Devil here, throughout all France Cou'd find no Agent for his horrid purpose But me, whose best Religion is my Loyalty! The only he, that wou'd confound his Mischiefs, Is a clear sign of your Eternal Justice. I am for honest Actions as for great; If I can bring up a new fashion, And rise in Court for Virtue, speed his Plough: The King has known me long as well as he, Yet cou'd my Fortune never fit the length Of both their Understandings, till this hour. Enter Maffe. Maffe. Humour of Princes! can this Fellow here, This sneaking, paltry, tatter'd Ragamuffin Have any Merit worth a Thousand Crowns? His Highness sure is mad, or would make me so. He looks as if he rather wants a Dinner, A good large Bellyful than a full Bag: I must examine this. How now, poor Fellow, Is thy name D' Ambois? D' Ambois. Sir. Maffe. Is thy name D' Ambois, I ask thee; what, Art deaf? D' Ambois. How now? who have we here? serve you the Monsieur? Maffe. What? D' Ambois. 'S death, serve you the Monsieur? Maffe. Yes that I do serve the Monsieur; this Fellow's Sawcy, a right beggerly impudent Rogue, Aside. I'le not give him a souse. D' Ambois. Why then, Sir, I suppose. Maffe. Sir, I suppose—Good Captain Bare-enough, that I am Steward to my Lord, and will be used with More Respect ere I dispose his Bounty, for all You are so hot, Sir. D' Ambois. I cry your mercy, Sir. Now you have open'd my dull Eyes, I see you, And should be glad to see the Bounty spoke of. Pray what might I call your Name? Maffe. My Name! 'tis a sign thou art a fine Fellow Not to know my Name, thou hast been well Bred I warrant; but come, to make thee a Little wiser, know at Court Men call me Monsieur Maffe. D' Ambois. Monsieur Maffe! Maffe. Ay, with your Hat off, Sirrah, Monsieur Maffe, Learn Breeding, Sirrah, learn Breeding. Well, to proceed to a farther understanding, What Countryman are you, Friend? D' Ambois. Why Friend, suppose an Englishman. Maffe. An Englishman! D' Ambois. An Englishman. Maffe. Why then you 're a Madman, Sirrah; and there's Another Reason I'le not give you a Souse. D' Ambois. How! A Madman, Sir. Maffe. Oo'ns you're all so, there's not a sound Brain Amongst you, some with Love, some with Drink, And some with a kicksey-whimsey thing you call Religion; You're bewitcht, the Devils in you all. D' Ambois. Most admirable Steward; what an impudent Dog is this! [Aside. Maffe. I've found this Fellow out, I see quite through Him now: a hundred Crowns will make him swagger, Caper, and get drunk with drinking Healths to my Lords Royal Bounty: So there's nine hundred saved, to give my Wife A Necklace, Ring, or some such pretty trifle; This now is call'd Discretion: here poor Caterpillar, not to defer thy Fortune any longer, His Highness sends thee a whole hundred Crowns. D' Ambois. A hundred, Sir! nay, do his Highness right; I know his Hand is larger, and perhaps I may deserve more than my Outside shows; I am a Poet, as I am a Soldier; And being well incourag'd, Sir, may write His praise for giving, yours for delivering, Like a most faithful Steward what he orders. Maffe. A Poet too, and in this Age of Blockheads! Thou'rt like to be an Alderman; prythee Take my Advice, and instead of thy Poetry Learn to pick a Pocket, or the mysterious Art Of Pimping. But Prythee if thou shou'dst fall a Rhimeing What wou'd thy Subject be? Ha! D' Ambois. Why faith I care not much: If to his bounteous Grace I sing the praise O fair great Noses, and to you of Long ones. [Pulls him by the Nose. Maffe. An odd sort of a Fellow this, a very Odd sort of a Fellow, and Gad I Begin to fear him. D' Ambois. How say you? how dost thou like the Theme, Old Ink-bottle? hah! Come, what Qualities Have you besides your Jacket, and Gold Chain? Can your Worship dance? [Turns him about. Maffe. This is a plaguy Fellow, and I'me as plaguely Affray'd of him: If he shou'd be possess'd with A British Devil now, or carry ere a Gomera Crag-Snuffle-dum-weehee Fiend about Him, that shou'd break my head in old Welsh. I had better have left off playing Tricks, 'Gad I'le venture Him no longer, come, come, dost hear I jested with thee a little to try thy Wit, but Now in earnest bring thee a Thousand Crowns; Sirrah, be thrifty and play the good Husband, And you may make it a good standing Living, 'Tis a Bounty his Highness might perhaps have Bestowed better. D' Ambois. Sirrah, y'are a Raskal, and you lye. Strikes him. Maffe. How, Sir. D' Ambois. Mutter another Word, And by thy Villains Blood it is thy last. Strikes again. Maffe. Oh Lord! D' Ambois. A barbarous Groom, to grudge his Masters Bounty! For well I know he wou'd like Death abhor His Hind shou'd argue, what he gives his Friend. Down, crouch, you Mungrel Cur, crawl to your Kennel, And thank thy sordid Baseness that preserves thee. Throws him down, kicks him and Exit. Maffe. Ah—why this was rather a Belzebub than a Britain, this must Be some damn'd hot Bavarian Flap-dragon, That has been Bombing of Towns, and Comes just now fizzing red hot out of a Mortar-piece; have I liv'd thus long with the Authority of a Controuler, and am I at last Forc't to crawl like a Dog in a Dublet, And at my years too? Well, If this be known, I shall be hooted to Death by all the Boys; Therefore I'le keep it secret, and limp home As well as my Legs will carry me, and The better to disguise it, I'le my old stock of Impudence put on, And look, as well as one that's beaten can.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENE I. The Court. Enter Tamira and Charlott. Tam. I scarce have Sense left to believe thy News. Cha. Madam, you may rely upon't. Tam. O Heavens! That Monsieur has brought D' Amboise to Court! Cha. Most certainly; and hangs about his Neck As if they Twinn'd both at a Birth together: He's now to introduce him to the King. How much concern'd she is! [Aside. Tam. O cou'd he look In some inchanted Glass, and see my Heart, How the poor Inmate struggles to get out; And when my Soul beholds him through my Eyes, How it leaps up in Extasie to meet him! Then sure he would not think I was ungrateful. Cha. She's strangely Rapt! [Aside. Tam. Pray Heaven my Governess have kept her Word: This News affects me strangely: And see, The King and Court appear. Lie close my Joyes, [Exit Cha. Smother'd, and husht like Waters in a Calm: I'le thrust my self into the Crowd to see The Entrance of my Hearts best Deity. Enter King Henry, Guise, Montsurry, Barrisor, L'Annou, Pirrhot, Brisack, Mellinel, Dutchess of Guise, Beaupre, Annable, Pero, Guards and Attendnts. Bris. These bold Confederates crowd about the Guise, As if they'd brave the King here in the Presence. Mel. Oh, you know Faction is a kind of Hydra, That whilst you Lop one Head, another grows. Briss. This new made Peace between the Guise and him I fear wants Power to quench the old Resentments. King. When went the English Embassadors from hence? Briss. Some two days since, Sir. King. That Island once was happy in her Natives; And no one Court in Christendom could boast Of Men more Valiant or more rarely qualified. With Shame, I needs must own it, our French Court Was held a Mirrour of Confusion to it. Guise. I never thought so Sir. Briss. Faith I believe thee: Nor any thing else that ever he thought. [Aside. Mell. Peace, we shall hear more; I see th'Ambitious Vein Is glowing on the front of the Proud Guise. King. How is it then my Lord in your Opinion? Guise. For my part Sir, I think e'm slight and vain, And that they've aped the Model of our Court As they have still out-aped us in our Habits. Never were Snakes so weary of their Skins, And apt to leap out of themselves as they; Who when they Travel to become Rare Men, Come home improv'd with a new foppish Suit, Like Monkies, cover'd with the Garbs of Men. Mount. Nay now my Lord, your Grace is moved with Spleen: For tho the Youth and Gayety of some May shew a little lightness of the Soul, Till Ripening Years has given 'em Grains of weight, Yet no wise Husbandman gives o're his Harvest Because there chanced a Mildew, or a Blast; But Gleans the best and soundest of his Grain, 'Till the next Year repairs him with its Plenty. King. Vain as they were, my Lord, slight as you make 'em, I should be highly pleased by your example To see our Count outdo 'em. Mell. There's a Rub. Briss. The Guise will at him agen; He's studying for another Contradiction, I'le lay my Life. Mell. Hee'd Choak else, Ha! can I believe my Eyes? look, who comes yonder? Enter Monsieur and D'Amboise, Richly Habited. Briss. D'Amboise, by all that's good, and Monsieur with him. Mell. This is an Age of Miracles; How the Guise Ogles him! Mons. Sir, I have brought a Gentleman to Court, and Pray will you vouchsafe to do him Grace. King. D'Amboise I think. D'Amboise Kneels and Kisses the Kings Hand. D'Amboise. That's still my name, Dread Sir, Tho I am somewhat alter'd in my Habit. King. I like your Alteration, and must tell you I have expected the offer of your Service, For I, in fear to make mild Vertue proud, Use not to seek her out in any one. D'Amboise. Nor does she, to seek out every one. Monarchs indeed have a prerogative, And Vertue is their Vassal. Mons. I woo'd her Modesty in him, Sir, And paid her those dues that I think she merits. King. If you have woo'd and won, then Brother wear him. Mons. Thou art mine, D'Amboise, Come now, I'le Enter thee [Governess aside whispers D'Amboise. Among the Ladies; first here's The Guise's Dutchess; the next the Joy of my Soul, The Charming Countess of Mount Surry. D'Amboise. Ha! What says he? the Joy of his Soul? [Aside. Mons. Come, I'le introduce you. Ladies, you are too many to be in Counsel, I have here a Friend that will be glad to Enter into your Graces. Dutch. If he would be enter'd into our Graces, my Lord, Methinks you should give him leave to speak For himself. Beau. Has he never been a Courtier, my Lord? Mons. Never, my Lady. Dutch. And why did the Toy take him in the Head now? D'Ambois. 'Tis Leap-Year, Madam, and therefore very Good to enter a Courtier. King. Dutchess of Guise, you'll find there's one Is not too Bashful. [King goes and sits down at a Table, and beckons Mount Surry to Play at Chesse. Dutch. No, Sir, I rather wish he Be'nt guily of the bold Extremity. Tam. The Gentleman would be a Courtier at First sight; but Sir you are mistaken, you must Learn your Horn-book, and your Psalter, and A scurvy Treatise or two more, before you Come to your Court Grammar. D'Amboise. You shall teach me any Lesson you please Madam, Nay, and whip me, if I grow dull; I'm sure 'Twill be reasonable, and for my Instruction. Dutch. I dare swear, he has assurance enough, To think he does deserve at first. D'Amboise. Faith Madam, that assurance you speak of, I think is the only thing I want of a Courtier; But I shall quickly improve, and would Gladly take Protection Madam, under Your Graces Colours. Dutch. Soft and Fair Sir, do you not know you Must rise by degrees, first being the Servant Of some common Lady, or Knights Wife; Then a little higher, to a Lords Wife; next A little higher, to a Countess; yet a little Higher to a Dutchess; and then turn the Ladder. Guise. How now! they're very familiar methinks. Barr., L'Annou. Ha, ha, ha. D'Amboise. Will you allow a Man then Four Mistresses Madam, When the greatest Mistress is allowed but Three Servants? Dutch. Where find you that Statute, Sir? D'Amboise. Why be judg'd by the Groom Porters. Dutch. The Groom Porters? D'Amboise. Ay Madam, must not they judge of all Games I'th'Court? Dutch. You talk like a Gamster. Guise. Sir, know you me? D'Amboise. My Lord? Guise. I know you not; whom do you serve? D'Amboise. Serve, my Lord? Guise. Hence prating Upstart, your Courtship is Too Sawcy. D'Amboise. Upstart and Sawcy; 'tis the Guise, but yet Those Terms might have been spared Of the Guisard. Sawcy, he's Jealous by This light; are you blind o'that side Duke! I'le To her again, for that: on Princely Mistriss, For the honour of Courtship, another Riddle. Guise. Cease your Courtship, or by Heavens I'le cut your Throat. D'Amboise. Cut my Throat, cut a Whetstone; Butcher Every thing with thy Tongue, or thy curst Agents, Thy Sword I'm sure is slow enough in danger: I wish the King fear'd the cutting of his Throat No more, than I fear thy cutting mine. Guise. I'le do't by this Hand. D'Amboise. That Hand dares not do it; Thou'st cut too many Throats already, Guise, And Robb'd the Land of many Thousand Souls More precious than thy own. Come Madam, I beseech your Grace talk; your Wit does wonders; For as I was saying, Pyrr. There's some strange disorder. Barr. A sudden Transmigration with D'Amboise; Methinks in a minute; from the Court Lobby Into the Dutchesses Closset. L'Ann. You see what wonders a fine Suit can work. Pyrr. Prithee step to the Guise and discover him. Barr. By no means, let the new Suit work; We'll see the Issue. Guise. Leave your prating. D'Amboise. I will not. I say noble Mistress, and I will stand too't, That if a Woman may have Three Servants, a Man May have Threescore Mistresses. Guise. Sirrah, I'le have you whipt out of the Court For this Insolence. D'Amboise. Whipt! such another Syllable out of the presence If thou darst for thy Dukedom. Guise. Remember Poltroon. Mons. What's the matter? prithee forbear. D'Amboise. Oh by the Infernals, were not the King i't'h presence, He should strew the Chamber like a Rush. Mons. But leave Courting his Wife then. D'Amboise. 'Sdeath, Hell and Furies, I'le Court her In spight of him. Not Court her? Come Madam, For Heavens sake talk on, fear nothing; but Let's have another Story. Well mayst thou Drive thy Master from the Court, but never D'Amboise. Mons. His great Heart will not down, come Come away my Lord,— [To Guise, he takes the Dutchess away; then Ex. Mons. Dutchess Ladies and Guise. Guise. I'le find a time. D'Amboise. Pish, Vapour. Tam. Pray Heaven the old Governess Has done her Message; I would fain speak with him, For methinks the Guise looks very mischievously. Barr. Why here's a Lion scared with the Throat of a Dunghill Cock: A Craven That has just shaked off his Gafflets, now does He Crow for the Victory. L'Ann. 'Tis one of the best Farces e're was acted. Pyrr. Who does the Guise suppose him to be, I wonder. L'Ann. Some Countrey Heir, I warrant, and thinks That Suit new drawn out of the Mercer's Book. Barr. I have heard of a Fellow that by fixt Imaginations, looking upon a Bull-Baiting, Had a visible pair of Horns grew out Of his Forehead; so I believe this Gallant Overjoy'd with Monsieur's cast Suit, imagines himself To be Monsieur. Pyrr. Peace, he looks this way. What will you say Now, if the Guise be gone to fetch a Blanket for him? L'Ann. D'slife, how he stares on us! Barr. Bless us, let's away! Briss. D'Amboise is making up to 'em, I hope 'twill Come to something. Mell. The fleering Fops, deserve a beating richly. D'Amboise. I'll say that for 'em. Now Sir, take your full view; how does the Object please you? Barr. If you ask my Opinion Sir, I think your Suit sits as well As if't had been made for you. D'Amboise. So Sir, and was that the subject of your ridiculous Jollity? Pyrr. Perhaps it was Sir. D'Amboise. Sir, I have observed all your fleerings; And though you're now in a place of safety, We shall meet, when this buffoonly Grinning Will cost you the best Blood in your Bodies. L. Ann. Go, go, Sir, Court your Mistress, and bring her to your Party. Bar. Ay, and his Sister too, or else we shall have odds against him. D'Ambois. Pish, Valour stands not in number: I dare avouch One Man may beat three Boys. Barr. Boys Sir! Briss. Nay Gentlemen, you shall have no odds of him neither; He's as good a Man as the proudest of you, and You shall not wrong him. Barr. Not Sir. Mell. Not Sir; tho he have not your Titles, I believe him a Better Man than the best of you, And I'le Justifie him. Pyrr. Will you, Sir? Mell. Yes, Sir, that will I. D'Ambois. I shou'd thank you for this Kindness, Gent. If I thought these perfumed Muskats being Out of this Priviledge durst but mew at us. Barr. Does your Confidence doubt that, Sir? Follow and try. L'Ann. Come, Sir, we'll lead you a Dance. Exeunt. King rises from Play. King. My Lord, your Judgment gets the better of me, I should take odds of you: Mont. A Minute's Chance, Sir: To morrow it will Be your Majesties. King. Perhaps so too. When went the Guise away? Mount. About half an hour since, Sir; and as I guess In some distaste with D'Amboise. King. I know it galls his Envy, to see his suddain Bravery and Great Spirit. Mont. I hope not, Sir, the Guise has many Vertues. King. O my Lord, This Envy is a Creature of strange Nature; She feeds on outcast Intrails like a Kite: In which foul Heap, if any Ill lies hid, She sticks her Beak into it, shakes it up, And throws it all abroad, that all may view it; Corruption is her Nutriment; but touch her With any Sovereign Oyntment, and you kill her. Where she finds any Faults in Men, she feasts, And with loud Scandals bruits 'em through the World, To spread Contagion; but if she tastes The smallest Relish of commended Virtue, She Surfeits of it, and is like a Fly That passes all the Bodies soundest parts, And dwells upon the Sores. Wise Men may shun her, But she has never Power to shun her self. For wheresoe're she flies from her own harms, She bears her Foes still Claspt within her Arms. SCENE The Field. Enter D'Amboise, Brissack, Mellinel, Barressor, L'Annou, Pyrhot, stript for the Duel. Barr. Come surly Sir, whose rough Abilities Would jostle out the Vertues of Mankind, And proudly think yours are the only Worthy; We'll shew you that we are not so much Courtiers, But we can fight as well as we can talk. D'Ambois. I am glad on't, And wish all Courts were furnish'd with such Men; Good ones would then be valued, and Fools find Scorn: We judge of Minds not by their Deeds, but Habits, And gaudy flattering Favourites are esteem'd The wisest in the Land, tho ne're such Blockheads. L'An. Our Swords will best decide our Merits, Sir: Briss. They are the fittest Disputants i'th'Field. D'Ambois. One thing I urge: These Gentlemen are Strangers, And tho they nobly lent their Courtesie To assist me against your mean deriding me; The Injury was Levell'd all at me, And I would right my self against ye all: Let one at once assail me honourably, If I hold out t' th'last, mine be the Praise; Or if I sink by th'first, let it be thine: It will a satisfaction give in Death, That I have not engag'd the Innocent. Barr. This looks like Boast, D'Amboise; but be it so. Mell. I except against the Offer. Briss. And I: Think not, D'Amboise, the Quarrel we espous'd Shall be determin'd, and we not engag'd. Pirhot. Come, no more Words, so we fight, be it any ways. D'Ambois. It must be some way, I wish it might be mine. [They fight, Mellinor kills Pyrhot, Lannou, Brisack.] Barr. Some Pause, D'Amboise, Two of our Friends are gone, preserve the Others, and thee and I decide it. D'Ambois. Agreed. Mellinel. No, I have lost my Friend, and will revenge him. Lannou. Come on then. D'Ambois. It is in vain to stop them. Now Barressor! Barr. I shrink not yet. D'Ambois. Thy Blood flows fast. Barr. I am the lighter for't. Mell. D'Amboise. Farewel. [Mel falls. Barr. I follow thee. [Bar. falls. L' An. Here's more Work yet. D'Ambois. L'Annou, thou'rt brave; I'm satisfy'd; There's Blood enough shed. L'Annou. Too much, D'Amboise; had there been none At all, it had been well; but now there Must be more; thou wer't for fighting us all round, Ar't satifi'd with one? D'Ambois. Think not I'm tyr'd. Oh Tamira, if I fall, Farewel. [Fight, L'Annou falls. L'Annou. Tamira's thine, and thou hast thy Revenge. Gallant D'Ambois! I love thee now, and Grieve for my Affront. D'Ambois. The Rest of Infant Souls uncharg'd with Sin be with thee and my Noble Friends.—Mischief has been too powerful among us; and what my Fate will be who does survive thee, I know not, nor I fear not. Now to Tamira; she sent to me before I fought; and 'tis for her I hope, Heaven has preserv'd me. From Honours Bloody Field I must remove, And hush my Danger in the Arms of Love. [Exit. SCENE III. Enter Monsieur and Tamira. Mons. Madam, regard your own Good, if not mine: You do not know what you may be by me; perhaps I shortly May have the Power to advance, or pull down any. Tam. That's not my Study, one way I'm sure You shall not pull down me. My Husband's Height Is Crown to all my Hopes; and his retiring To any mean State shall be my Preferment; My Honour's in my own Hands, spight of Kings. Mons. Honour, what's that? Your second Maidenhead? Thus all your plaguy Sex will cry when courted By one you do not fancy; but if you like Your Addressor, Your Husband is your necessary Tool, Your Fop, to own Brats which worse Fops beget, And wears more Horns than are in Arden Forest. Tam. Does this Talk suit a Prince? Mons. Do not I know, Madam, You live in Court here by your own Election, Frequenting all our Publick Sports and Revels, All the most youthful Companies of Men? And wherefore do you this? to please your Husband? 'Tis gross and fulsom: If your Husbands Pleasure Be all your Object, and you aim at Honour, In living close to him; get you from Court, You may have him at home. Speak plain, and say, I do not like you, Sir, You're an ill-favour'd Fellow in my Eye, And I am answered. Tam. Then I pray be answered; For to be plain, I do not like your Highness In that way you like. Mons. 'Sdeath! Hell and Furies! could I you please your Eye, You wou'd like me as well e're you would lose me: Honour! and Husband! Now by yon bright Planet, All Hell has not the Mischief of one Woman. Tam. Now by this Light, my Lord, I'le tell the King Your vile and most ungenerous Proceedings; A Lady cannot breath Court-Air, and live As she was born, and with that sort of Pleasure That fits her state, but she must be defamed With an infamous Lord's Detraction. Who's there? Come Diligence; what? you're at your Book, When Men are at your Mistress. Have I taught you Enter Charlotte. Any such Waiting-womans Quality? Mons. Has your Lady taught you to know Men from Men, To squint upon the happy one in Favour, And turn the Fool that's slighted out of Doors? And d'ye forget? For that's I know your Lesson, And so farewel good Husband. [Exit. Tam. Farewel wicked Prince, and yet I scarce can call him so, For in my Conscience he is in the right; And when a Womans Heart is once possess'd, Nothing so nauseous as a Second Lover. Enter Montsurry. My Husband here! If he stays I'm undone. Mont. How does my Love? Was not the Monsieur here? Tam. Yes, to rare purpose, And your Cause is as good to seek him too, And haunt his Company. Mont. Why? What's the matter? Tam. Matter of Death, were I Wife to some Men; I cannot live in Quiet in my House For Importunities, almost to Rapes Offer'd me by him. Mont. Prithee bear with him; Thou knowest he is unmarried, and a Courtier, Ay, and a Prince. Be merry then my Life, and laugh at him; I know my Presence is so dear to thee, That other Men appear worse than they are: Yet I must beg thy Pardon for this Night, Thou know'st how far I am engag'd to th'King, Besides my Promise. Tam. I am so sensible of it, That, my Lord, you shall not stay one minute longer. Mont. I fear thou wilt be Melancholy. Tam. No, not much: Be sure you come I'th'Morning. Mont. With the Rising Sun I'le visit thy more comfortable Beauty; In the mean time Farewel my Love. [Exit. Tam. Adieu, dear Husband. Oh that all Wives, betray'd to this curst Yoke, And forc'd to draw with one they cannot love, Cou'd see this parting 'twixt my Lord and me, And learn the subtile Art of wise Dissembling, Of which I now pretend to be Arts Mistress, And best know how to bear the Clog of Wedlock. Get you to Bed. This coming Night [To Char. I'le trouble none of your Services: Make sure The Doors, and call your other Fellows to their Rest. Char. Yes, Madam; yet I will watch too, [Aside To know why you watch; perhaps I may discover Something, and deserve another Purse Like that the Monsieur gave me last. [Exit. Tam. Oh that as yet my Heart and Inclinations All tend to Vertue, I could sway my Passion, And look on D'Amboise with Indifferent Eyes; But 'tis too late I fear; Love's powerful Influence Has crowded every Corner in my Breast, And there's no Room for Decency or Reason: He comes, he comes— How shall I look on him, how shall I live, And not consume in blushes, if there be In Nature, such a thing as Modesty? [Exit. Enter D'Amboise, Teresia from the Vault. D'Ambois. Is this the Antichamber? Teres. 'Tis next her Bed-Chamber: What? you would be there, Would you? D'Ambois. Ay, ay, Mother, the closer the Devotion the better, you know; Go, go, prithee give her Notice. Teres. Heark! D'ye hear nothing! D'Ambois. No, no. Teres. The Cats are howling and scratching one another; There's no good near hand, when such unsanctified Noises are abroad. D'Ambois. Let 'em scratch and be damn'd: Prithee be gon. Teres. Well, if I am not preferr'd after this, there's no Gratitude in being, that I'm sure of: [Exit. D'Ambois. Now all the Peaceful Regents of the Night, Silently gliding Exhalations, Languishing Winds and murmuring Falls of Waters, Sadness of Heart and Ominous secureness, Inchantments, dead Sleeps, all the Friends of Rest That ever workt upon the Life of Man, Assist me now, and this Charm'd Hour, Fix like the Center, make the violent Wheels Of time and fortune stand, and great existence (The Makers Treasure,) now not seem to be, To all but my approaching love and me. Enter Tamira and Teresia. Tam. O I must see him, tho each step he takes Goes to my Heart. D'Ambois. Madam upon my Knees I wait your doom. Tam. O rise, Sir rise, why would you come thus late? Tho I did send to you to prevent a danger, Why would you take me at my word, and at A time for Visits so unfit? how durst you Enter here? D'Ambois. Where is the harm sweet, since your Honour is secure. Tam. How are you sure of that? what tho my Husband Lye forth to Night, and all our Female Servants Fast bound in Sleep, yet there's one that wakes above, Whose Eye no Sleep can bind; he sees Through Walls and Doors, nay even our Thoughts. D'Amboise. He sees in pity then, and not in Anger: Besides, what can he see, but a wrong'd wretch'd Lover, Taxing his dearest Mistress with foul Perjury, And breach of holy Vows? Tam. O do not break my Heart with talking so, You know I was betrayed. D'Amboise. Then I know too, You should, if you could pity, do me Justice. Tam. Alas, how is it possible? I am now anothers. D'Amboise. By Stealth, by Rapine, Irreligious Force; For sure I am, your Will was not consenting; And to that Will, should joyn this beauteous Body Which once I durst call mine. O by the Gods Here do I clasp thee with a Lovers right, And on thy Breast, the Altar of my Vows, The sweet undoer of a Faithful heart, Swear by the sacred influence about thee, Never to sever or unloose my hold Till I have Comfort from thee. Tam. Let go Rash Man, and since you will persist, Tell me the Story of your Griefs within; For once I'le hear it; but if you grow bold, Never expect to see my Face again. [Exit. Teres. What, I warrant you have angred her now. D'Ambois. No, no, shee'l return presently; I must get this Old Gibcat out of the way. Prithee dear [Aside. Mother, look to the Vault Door; I think I heard A Noise. I must follow her, she has promis'd To speak to Monsieur to beg my Pardon of the King About the Duel; and you know I must not neglect it. Have but a little patience, I'le be with you presently. Teres. Patience, ah Son, Son, here will be fine work; Well, go too, Remember, d'ye hear. D'Amboise. Why canst thou think I'le forget thee? Go, go Prithee make haste into the Vault. So, so, And now I'le bring new Forces to the Siege. Ne're let the Heroe doubt the Fort to win, That Storms without, and Love betrays within. [Exit. Finis Actus Secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCENE Continues. Enter Tamira. [D'Amboise taking leave, descends into the Vault. Tam. He's gone, and with him, all my Courage fled, And I am now left wholly to my Fears; Oh, I have open'd all the Doors of Danger To my encompass'd Honour and my Life. Before, I was secure 'gainst Death and Hell, But now am subject to the heartless fear Of every Shadow, and of every Breath; So confident a spotless Conscience is; So weak a Guilty. No Roof nor Shelter can secure us so, But it will drown our Cheeks in Tears and Sorrow. Enter Mount Surry. Mont. Good Morrow to my Life! what up already? Tam. Ay, my dear Lord, not all this Night have I Undress'd my self, nor could I sleep a jot. Mont. Why, my Hearts Joy, what troubled my dear Life? Tam. Alas, to what end should I go to Bed, That wholly miss'd the comfort of my Bed; My Soul, my Heart, my Life? Mont. Ah dear, dear, Charmer. [Embraces her. Tam. Or how could Sleep possess my Faculties, Wanting the proper closer of my Eyes? Mont. Well, I will never more sleep night from thee; All my own business, all the King's Affairs Shall take the day to serve 'em. Every Night I'le always dedicate to thy delight. Tam. Not so my Lord, that will look much amiss, I can make shift another night like this. Mont. Come to the Presence then, and see great Damboise, Fortunes proud Mushroom, shot up in a Night, Stand like an Atlas under the King's Arm; Which Greatness in him, Monsieur now envies As Bitterly and deadly as the Guise. Tam. What, he that was but Yesterday his Maker, His Raiser, and Preserver! Mont. Even the same. Tam. How can that be? [How my Heart throbs o'th suddain? Aside. Mont. A Duel late was fought of Bloody consequence, In which he being principally concern'd, The Monsieur got his pardon of the King, And for the same, propos'd to him a business Which D'Amboise has refused, and since inform'd our Master In some by-hints th'Ambition of his Brother; Which being secretly observed by Monsieur, Has turn'd his outward love to inward hate. But on the contrary, the King admires him, Designs him for a Count, and stiles him now his Eagle. Tam. Strange Revolution! but I hope my Lord You'll take the Juster side. Mont. Nay, for my part I have no personal malice to the Man, He never did me hurt. Tam. Nor me, I'm sure. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter King, Guise, Monsieur, Dutchess, Ladies, Gent. Guards. King. That I did pardon him, was at your Request, How comes this suddain Revocation? Mons. I had not then consider'd on it Sir. King. Then I have now consider'd of it Brother, And find the nature of his Quarrel Just. Admit him. [Enter D'Amboise. Stand up Count, and let your wary valour [D'Amboise Kneels. Henceforth show, that you deserve our Pardon. Bussy. Royal Sir, I lothe as much a deed of unjust nature As Law it self does, and to insult on others; Because I have as little spirit to dare, And power to do, as to be insulted on; Yet thus low I must humbly beg your Majesty, And hope it will be heard by your high Goodness, That I may justly use what Law and Nature Have given me for defence; since I am free, Offending no Just Law, let no Law make By any wrong it does, my Life her Slave: But when I am wrong'd, this Law fails to right me, Let me be King my self, as Man was made, [Rises. And do a Justice that exceeds the Law, If my wrong pass the power of single Valour, To right and expiate; you are still my King, And can do right exceeding Law and Nature. Who to himself is Law, no Law does need, Offends no Law, and is a Man indeed. King. Brave Man, enjoy thy wish, I'le back it with my Powers. Bussy. The Life you give, Great Sir, is ever yours. King. Thy love speaks heartily, thy Impartial Words Are like brave Faulcons, that dare truss a Fowl Much greater than themselves; Flatterers are Kites That prey on Sparrows. Thou shalt be my Eagle, And bear my Thunder underneath thy Wings. Buss. Where e're I see a smooth Tongu'd Sycophant, I hate him like the Devil, his dear Tutor. King. Fly at him, and his Brood: I cast thee off. And once more give thee Sirname of my Eagle. Buss. I'le make you sport enough Sir, let me have My Lucerns too, my Dogs Inur'd to hunt Beasts of such Rapine, only to put 'em up; And if I truss not then my Quarry, slight me. Shew me a Clergy-Man that is in Voice A Lark of Heaven, in Heart, a Mole of Earth; That Morals reads, yet leads a wicked life, Has a meek Look, but a luxurious Paunch; And tho he preaches vertuous Continence, Shall meet a flesh'd Whore in a Bawdy Corner, And use her, tho the Consequence be Murder. Let me but Hawk at him, and like a Fellon, He shall confess all, and you then may hang him. Shew me a Lawyer that turns Sacred Law, The equal render of each Man his own. The Sanctuary and Impregnable Defence Of retir'd Learning, and distress'd Virtue, Into a Harpy that all things devours, That in a bad cause Bawls till his vile Ears Are Deaf with the very Ecchoes of his Nonsense: Yet in a good one, if the needy Client want Gold to anoint, shall lose it for a Jest: Let me but Hawk once at the Rogue, and then He shall confess all too, and you may hang him. Enter Mount Surry and Tamira. [King and Mont. talk. Guise. Where would you seek such Game as you would hawk at. Buss. I'le Hawk about your House for one. Guise. Come y'are a Glorious Ruffian, and run Mad With the Kings headlong Graces; stop your Breath, Or by that poyson'd vapour, not himself, Shall back your Murderous slander against me. Buss. Oh that the King would make his Presence free But for one Brush betwixt us! By the Reverence Due to the sacred space between Kings and Subjects, Here would I make thee cast that that popular Purple In which thy proud Soul sits and braves thy Sovereign. Mons. Peace, Peace, I prithee Peace. Buss. Let him peace first, that gave the first disturbance. Mons. He's the better Man. Buss. And therefore should do best. Mons. He has more Titles. Buss. So Hidra had more Heads. Mons. He's greater far. Buss. His greatness is the Peoples, mine's my own. Mons. He's nobly born. Buss. What then, so am I; True Nobleness in Blood, has no gradation But in our Merit. Guise. Thou'rt not nobly born, But Bastard to the Cardinal of Amboise. Buss. Thou lyest proud Guiserd: Oh let me fly, Sir. [To the King. King. Not in my Face, my Eagle. Buss. Still shall we rail and foam upon this Bitt? Is the Guise only great in Faction? Stands he not by himself? Holds he the Opinion That Mens Souls are without 'em? Be a Duke, And lead me to the Field. Guise. Come, follow me. King. Stay 'em, stay D'Amboise; Cozen Guise, I wonder Your prudent Disposition brooks so ill; A Man so good, that only would uphold Man in his Native Nobleness, from whose fall All our Dissentions rise; for 'tis most certain, That the Bounteous and Impartial hand of Nature, That all things gave in the Original, Without the definite terms of Thine and Mine, Had nere bin Ravish'd by the Hand of Fortune, Had all preserv'd her in her prime, like D'Amboise. Let my hand therefore be the Hermean Rod, To part and reconcile, and so preserve you As my combin'd Embracers and Supporters. Buss. My Lord, 'tis the Kings motion, and we shall not seem Womanish to any, tho we change thus so soon, Never so great Grudg for his greater pleasure. Guise. I seal to that, and so the Manly freedom That you so much profess, hereafter prove not A Bold and glorious License to desprave To me his Hand, shall hold the Hermean Virtue, To joyn all hearts, in which submissive sign, On this his Sacred right hand, I lay mine. Buss. 'Tis well my Lord, and so your worthy greatness Incline not to the greater Insolence, And make you think it a prerogative, To rack Mens Freedom by your Dignity. My hand stuck full of Lawrel, in true sign 'Tis wholly dedicate to Righteous Peace, In all submission kisses t'other side. King. I thank ye both; and equally invite you To a kind Banquet, where we'll sacrifice Full Cups to Confirmation of our Loves. At which, fair Ladies, I desire your Presence, And hope you Madam, will take off one Glass To the Reconcilement of your Lord and Servant. Dutchess. If I should fail it Sir, some other Lady Would be found there to do that for my Servant. Mons. Any of these here? Dutchess. Nay, I know not that. Buss. Are you of that Opinion, pretty Lady? Tam. I think not on you Sir, y'are one I know not. [Scornfully. Bussy. Cry ye Mercy Madam. Mont. Oh Sir, has she met with ye, ha, ha, ha. Bussy. 'Tis still my Luck my Lord, [Exeunt King, D'Amb. and Ladies. Manent Guise, Monsieur and Mount Surry. Mons. What had my Bounty drunk, when it rais'd him? Guise. Y'have stuck up a very worthy Flag, That takes more Wind, than we with all our Sails. Mont. Oh how he spreads and flourishes! Guise. He must down; Upstarts should never perch too near a Crown. Mons. And as this doting hand Even out of Earth, like Juno, struck this Giant, So Jove's great Ordnance shall be here imploy'd To strike him under th'Ætna of his Pride. To which work, lend your hands. In my opinion 'Tis necessary then, that we attempt The safest means to that discovery, And court our greatest Ladies chiefest Women With shews of Love, and liberal Promises. I have one already, that I think I'm sure of; 'Tis but our Breath. If something given in hand Sharpen their hopes of more, 'twill be well ventur'd. Guise. I'm of your Mind my Lord. Mons. I have broken The Ice to it already with the Woman Of your Chaste Lady, and conceive good hopes Against we meet next. Mont. Ah! there's small hopes there. Guis. Very like—Lord, Lord, how credulous these Cuckcold's are? [aside. —Here, she comes and two of her Companions. Enter Women. Mons. What starting back and from your Friend— [Takes hold of Charlot. Guise. Nay, Faith you are engag'd— [To Pero. Pero. Nay, Pray my Lord, forbear. [Exit Pero. Mont. What, are you skittish? [To Anable. Ana. No, my Lord, I have out liv'd that season long since. Mons. Now my dear Charlotte, hast thou remembred me for the discovery I intreated thee to make of thy Mistriss? Come, speak boldly, and be sure of all things that I have sworn to thee. Charl. Building on that assurance, my Lord, I may speak; and the rather, because my Lady has not intrusted me with what I can tell you, for now I d? not betray her. Mons. Whugh, that's all one; if thou didst so, we reach our aims; come, prithee let's hear. Charl. To tell you the truth, my Lord, I have made a strange Discovery. Mons. Excellent Rogue! how thou revivest me? thou shalt be married this Carnival, I'll make thee a Lady for't; I know a Coxombly Knight of my Acquaintance will do't for a Words speaking. Charl. Well, really your Highness is so obliging, tis this Then: Last Night my Lord lay out, and I, Watching my Lady's sitting up, stole up at Midnight From my bed, and having made a hole Quite through the Walls and Arras to her inmost Chamber, What do you think I saw? Mons. The Devil and she perhaps playing at Picket. Charl. 'Twas one indeed, that you like as ill as the Devil. Mons. I like as ill— Char. To be brief, my Lord, I saw her and D'Ambois reading a Letter. Mons. D' Ambois! Char. Even he, my Lord. Mons. Dost thou not dream, Wench? Charl. I swear, he is the Man. Mons. The Devil indeed, and thy Lady is his Dam; why This was the happiest shot that ever flew, the just Plague of Hypocrisie levelled it. Oh the infinite Regions betwixt a Woman's Tongue and her Heart! Is this our Goddess of Chastity?—But sweet Charlot, Who should she trust with this Conveyance? Or all The doors being fast, how should his Conveyance be made? Charl. Nay, my Lord, that amazes me, I cannot by any Study, so much as guess at it. Mons. Well, we'll forbear that a little— Mont. Prithee resolve me, the Duke will never Think I am busie about his Wife—Has D'Ambois Any privy Access to her? Anab. No my Lord, D'Ambois neglects her, and therefore She is suspitious, that either your Lady or the Lady Beaupre has closely entertin'd him. Mont. My Lady! ha, ha, that's a likely suspition indeed; By Heaven, I dare trust her with a thousand of 'em. Mons. Come, we'll disguise all with seeming only to have courted. Charl. And will your Highness be sure to remember the Knight. Mons. I will, I will upon my Honour— [Exeunt Women. Guis. I shall live to see thee laugh'd at e're it be long, ha, ha, ha. Mons. Well, my Lords, What fruit of our Inquisition? my Lord Montsurry, find you nothing budding, yet? Mont. It makes me smile to think on't, mine suspects that. Your Neice or my Wife closely entertains him! Mons. Your Wife, my Lord, think you that possible? Mont. Ridiculous! I know she flies him like her last hour. Mons. Her last hour, what! that comes upon her the more she flies it; Does D' Ambois so? think ye. Mont. That's not worth answering— Mons. Well, more of this another time, I'll meet you at the Banquet, and afterwards we'll consult. [Exit Mons. Guis. 'Tis miraculous to think, what Monsters Womens Imaginations ingross, when they are once Enamored, and what wonders they'll work for their Satisfaction, they will make a Sheep valiant, a Lyon fearful. Mont. And an Ass confident— [Aside. Well, my Lord, more will out shortly; come let's to the Banquet. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Hall. Re-enter Monsieur and Maffe. Mons. Make the Doors fast and sure, I'll speak with none till I come out. Maff. It shall be done my Lord, but I beseech your Highness, (That I this minute may discharge my honesty,) Be pleased to look on my Accompts. Mons. Dam your Accounts, ye Dunce, is this a minute— Maff. Dam my Accompts, my Lord. Mons. Get thee gone, if thou wouldst save a beating: Away I say, and let none enter, on thy Life. Maff. What the Devil ails him? Mons. Art thou here still? [Gall Page, Maff. Maff. No, no, my Lord, I have been gone this half hour. What the Devil ails him? [Peevishly. [Exit. Mons. Oh the unsounded Sea of Womens Blood! That when 'tis calmest is most dangerous; [Call Dambo. How many Joys are smiling in their Faces, When in their Hearts are Scilla and Charibdis? But what what a Mine of Sulphur have I drawn Into my bosome by this dangerous secret? Which if my haste with any Spark should light, E're D'Ambois were engag'd in some sure Plot, I were blown up, he would be sure my death: Grant therefore, thou bright Angel of my Life, A sure Lease of it, but for some few days, That I may clear my Bosome of the Snake I cherished there: And then I'll defie Fortune, I fear him strangely; his advancing Valour Is like a Spirit rais'd without a Circle, Endangering him that ignorantly rais'd him; And for whose Fury he has learnt no limits: How now— [Enter Page hastily. Page. My Lord, Count D'Ambois rushing in o'th'sudden, Is coming up the Stairs. Enter Maffe, running. Maff. I cannot help it, what could I do more? As I was gathering a strong Guard to line The Passage, and bar fast the Doors, the Man of Blood is entred. Mons. Thou starest as if thou hadst seen the Devil. Maff. 'Oons I had rather have seen a thousand, I Am not able to endure sight of him, I'll goe and hire A fencing Master to fight presently, there is no living else, I shall be murdered three times a day by him;— Here he comes, Gad zooks, I'll begone and hide my self. [Exit. Enter D'Ambois. Mons. Oh! Count, welcome, (pray Heaven he has found Out nothing,) how now, what leapest thou at? Buss. Oh Royal Object! Mons, Thou dreamst, awake, Object! In th'empthy Air. Buss. Worthy the Brows of Titan. Mons. Prithee, what meanst thou? Buss. See ye not a Crown Impale the Forehead of the great King Monsieur? Mons. Fie, fie; no more of that. Buss. Ah Prince! that is the Subject Of these your Melancholy close Retirements. Mons. Wilt thou ne'er leave that wrongful Supposition? On my Honour, I'm overjoyed to see thee; Thy Absence so long suffered oftentime, Puts me in some small doubt, thou dost not love me; Wilt thou do one thing therefore now sincerely? Buss. Ay, any thing, but killing of the King. Mons. Still in that Discord and ill taken Note; How most unseasonably thou playest the Echoe In this Fall thy of Friendship? Buss. Then doubt not, That there is any Act within my Nerves, But killing of the King, that is not yours. Mons. I will believe, to prove which by my Love Shewn to thy Vertues: I charge thee utter, even with all the Freedom, Both of thy noble Nature and thy Friendship, The full and plain state of me in thy Thoughts. Buss. What! utter plainly what I think of thee. Mons. Plain, as Truth. Buss. Why, this swims quite against the stream of Greatness; Great Men would rather hear their Flatterers, And if they are not made Fools, are not wise. Mons. I am no such great Fool, and therefore charge thee Even from the Root of thy free Heart display me. Buss. Since you affect it in such serious terms; If you your self will tell me what you think, As freely and as heartily of me; I'll be as open in my Thoughts of you. Mons. Agreed upon my Honour, and make this, That prove we in our full Description Never so foul, live still the sounder Friends. Buss. What else? Come, pay me home, I'll stand it bravely. Mons. I will I swear, I think thee then a Man That dares as much as a wild Horse or Tiger, As headstrong, and as bloody, and to feed The ravenous Woolf of thy most Canibal Valour, Rather than not employ it, thou wouldst turn Bully to any Bawd, Slave to a Jew, or English Usurer; Do any thing—but killing of the King— [Fleering by. That in thy Valour thou'rt like other Animals, That have strange gifts in Nature, but no Soul Diffus'd quite through to make 'em of a piece; But like a vicious Horse, that wants the sense To know his Master, who when he has gotten head, Leaps bolt upright, and having thrown his Rider, Turns Tail, and with his Hoof knocks out his Brains: And in thy Valour, which I call Barbarity, Thou'rt more ridiculous and vainglorious Than any Mountebanck, and impudent. Than any painted Whore, which not to flatter And glorifie thee like a Jupiter Hammon; Tho' eat'st thy Heart in Vinegar, and thy Gall Turns all thy Blood to poyson, which is Cause Of that Toadpool that stands in thy Complection; And makes thee with a cold and Earthly Moisture, As Plague to thy damn'd Pride, rot as thou liv'st; To study Calumnies and Treacheries, To humane Slaughters like a Screech Owl sing, And to all Mischiefs—but to kill the King. Buss. So, have you said? Mons. Yes Faith, What thinkest thou? Do I flatter thee? Speak I not like a true and trusty Friend? Buss. As ever any Man was blessed withal: Now here's for me; I think you then no Devil, Because you are very like to be no King; Of which with any Friend of yours I'll lay This keen Stiletto against all your Stars, Ay, and against your Treasons, which are more, That you did never good, but to doe ill; But ill of all sorts free and for it self; That like a Cannon making Lanes through Armies, The first Man of a Rank that whole Rank falling, If you have wrong'd a Man, you are so far From making him amends, that all his Race, Friends and Relations fall into your Chace. That y' have a Tongue so scandalous, 'twill cut The purest Christal, and a Breath that will Kill to that Wall, a Spider. And lastly, which I must for Gratitude ever remember My Politique Prince, I do believe and know That of my Rise you were the only Spring In Royal Hopes,—that I should kill the King. Mons. Why, now I see thou lov'st me; let's to the Banquet, And in thy Brothers Posture meet his Majesty, D'Amb. And let Fate judge, that knows what each intends If ever bitter Foes, seem'd better Friends. [Exeunt. [Curtain falls. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. SCENE I. King, Guise, D'Ambois, Mountsurry, Dutcherse, Tamira, Beaupre, Charlotte, Pero, Anabell, Monsieur: As at a Banquet, a Song and Dance performed, which ended, the King rises. King. No Joy can always last, our Griefs and Pleasures, Hold several Sceptres in us, and have times For their devided Empires; and that a Monarch, Guarded with Power, and blest with smiling Beauty: Hem'd round with Friends, and sated with new Pleasures, Cannot controll the ills of waining Nature; Tells us, there is above us something more, And greater that O'er rules us. Guis. Our Melancholly is the Child of Musick: Our Passions are so pleased with it they Surfeit. Bus. Methinks the Lady's Cheeks are pale o'th'sudden, And sure your Grace has lost that quickning Genius, That us'd to influence the Company. Dutch. I leave it now to you Sir, meerly to contradict That common saying, that Women ne'er are silent. Mons. That silence, often is a Sullen fit, That Ladies use oft to introduce their Wit. Dutch. I wish your Mistress were here, my Lord, then We should have, no doubt, a piece of Gayety, I Believe your Highness consults your Doctor always About your Women, who advises ye to chuse a pert Noisie, talking empty Creature, meerly to help Your Constitution, and drive away the Spleen? Mons. Why, faith, a Doctor, is very necessary to Madam, Consult with, about some Women in some Cases. Mont. He's the very Key keeper of their closest Cabinets: There should, in reason, be no other Match-maker. Bus. Then your Reason, in such a Case, would rather Be guided by Interest than Justice: Now in my opinion The Musty Father, that when his Daughter is of years of Discretion, will not let her choose a Husband for her self, ought to keep on her leading Strings, and let the Changling Dance about the World, in her Primitive Bibs and Aprons. Guis. What say you to that Madam— [to Tamira Tam. I think the Man has answered very well? Mons. The Man, why Madam, d'ye not know his Name? Tam. Man, is a Name of honour for a King; Additions often lessen Qualities. Mons. D'ye hear, Count; here is a Bar set to your Valour, It cannot enter here; no not to Notice, Of what your Name is, your great Eagles beak, Should you fly at her, had as good Encounter An Albion Cliff, as her obdurate heart. Bus. I'll not attempt her, Sir? I've heard her Character, And dare not venture, King. So fond she's of her Husband, she uses all men Scurvily: Mons. You would say so, if you knew all, Sir. Tam. Knew all, my Lord, what mean you? Mons. All that I know, Madam, Tam. That you know speak it. Mons. No, 'tis enough I feel it. [Passes from her scornfully. Dutch. My Lord, if I did know any thing that— [to Mont. Concerns him, you should be the last man, I would Tell it too; you were not contriv'd to keep a Secret; I could no more trust a man with that colour'd Eye brow, and Astronomical sort of a Nose, Than I would my own woman, if she were baited With a Husband to trap me in an Intreague: Mons. Sweet-heart come hither, prithee what if a man Should make horns at Monsurry, would it not strike Him jealous through all Proofs of his Chaste Ladies Virtues. Bus. If he be wise, not. Mons. What? not, if I should name the Gardner, That I would have him think has grafted him. Bus. That's as the License, that your Greatness uses, To Jest at all men, may be taught and constur'd; Mons. He could not sure be so blind and stupid, But he must feel a Pang. Bus. And you perhaps might feel a worser Punishment, For doing such a mischief, Mons. How, prithee, how? Bus. Perhaps led with a Train, where you may have Your Nose made less and slit, your Eyes thrust out. Mons. To me such violence, Who dares doe this to th'Brother of his King; Bus. Were you best Brother to the best of Kings, As you are one oth'worst, did all your Pimps and Panders Stand round to aid ye, all your stormy Laws, Spouted by Lawyers mouths, and gushing Blood, Like to so many Torrents; plead against me All your Prerogatives, your Racks and Tortures, The barbrous Engines of your damn'd Ambition: All daring Heaven, and opening Hell about ye; Were I the Man ye wrong'd so, and provok'd, Though ne'er so much beneath ye, like a Box-tree, I would by the firm Toughness of my Root. And the Indulgence of my Radical Vigour, Battel with all your Whirlwinds; and at last, Should you seek shelter in the Earths dark Caverns: Through Flames and Earthquakes, I would find ye there, And like a Bubble blow ye into Air. Mons. Go, thou'rt a Devil, such another Spirit Cannot be still'd from all th'Armenian Dragons. King. Here's nought but whispering with us, like a Calm Before a Tempest, when the silent Air Lays her soft Ear close to the Earth, to hearken. [Call Tamira, Charlot. For what she fears, steals on to Ravish her. It looks, as it forerunn'd some Controversie; Come, my brave Eagle, lets to Covert fly. Bus. Sir, I attend your Pleasure. [Exit. King leaning upon D'ambois. Guis. The King was right in his prophetick Speech, [after them the Ladies. Now stir the Humour and begin the brawl— [To Monsieur. Exit. Mont. The King and D' Ambois, now are grown all one? Mons. No, they are two, my Lord, [makes horns at him. Mont. How's that? Mons. No more. Mont. I must have more my Lord? Mons. What, more than two, [Points agen. Mont. How monstrous is this: Mons. Why? Mont. You make me horns; Mons. Not I, it is a work beyond my Power, Married mens Branches, are not made with Fingers; Your Wife, you know is a meer Cinthia, And she can fashion Horns out of her Nature. Mont. But do's she, dare you Charge her, Speak. Enter Tamira and Charlotte. Mons. Not at this time my Lord, you see who Enters, But when next we meet, I'll have a Paper for ye, That shall unfold it, better then my Tongue; In the mean time be Wise, Tam. What says he? Mont. You must make good the rest. Tam. What is't, my Lord, Takes my Love any thing to heart, he says? Mont. Come you are A— Tam. What my Lord, alas! will you revenge, Your Angers Just, cause given by him, on me. Mont. By him? Tam. I have admired a Thousand times, How you so long could be at Friendship with him. That still has plaid such Discords on your Honour. Mont. If he has plaid, I do suppose your Ladyship Lent him the Instrument. Tam. How's that, my Lord? Mont. Come you will still admire, Till my Head be the Miracle oth'World. Tam. Oh!— Seems to sound. Charl. Alas! She faints, help, good my Lord, and bend her Forward, speak to her, good my Lord. Mont. Look up, my Love, and by this Kiss receive My Soul amongst thy Spirits, I am sorry, I was so Rash. Tam. Oh! I have liv'd too long, to hear this from ye; Mont. 'Twas from my troubled Blood, and not from me, I was not then my self, to tell ye Truth; That wicked Prince, that left me when you entred, Did like a Gorgon turn me, into stone; And stabb'd me to the heart, thus with his Fingers. Tam. The base Effect of the inveterate Malice He owes me, for my shunning his foul suit; You see 'tis plain, my Lord. Mont. I know not whether he will vaunt t' have been The Princely Author of this slavish Sin, Or any other, he would have resolv'd me, Had you not come; and now has Promis'd further To show't in writing, which I'm resolv'd I'll see: I will about it instantly; Oh! Heaven defend; He should speak Truth for Madness, then would follow; And in my Rage there would be found no Limits. [Exit. Mont. Tam. 'Tis most impossible, he should discover it, For no one knows it, but my Governess; And, poor Soul, she is so charm'd with Charity, She thinks our meeting is a Case of Conscience: However, I will strait inform my Love, And then we shall be arm'd, whatever happens. [Exit. Charl. I'm Conscious to my self, here will be— A world of mischief, about my plaguy Tongue now, But the Monsieur has made my Stomach so wamble, Ever since he promised me this Husband, and this Ladyship do's buz all Night in my head: so that I Can't sleep a Jot for't; well, to be a faithful Servant to A Good Lady, is a fine thing, but to be a good Lady, for being no faithful Servant, is a finer thing, and Dignity since thy Face of Honour is towards me; Duty is but a kind of Footman, and I may kick him out of Doors. [Exit. SCENE. II. Enter Dillon, La Foyle, and another Servant. Dill. Where's my Lord Mountsurry's Groom? La Foy. Here, here, are the Maids, and the Sack Posset ready. Dill. All, all; we want nothing, but to get this musty Steward Out oth'way, prithee do but play thy part well now, And the Night's our own, La Foy. I'll warrant thee, let me alone, Dill. Away, away, here he comes. [Exit. Lay Foyle. Enter Maffe. Maff. Is the Fencing Master come yet? Dill. Yes Sir, he's below, and the rarest Fellow in all France; he shall Pick ye out any Button upon your Coat, Sir, and Carry it away upon his Point, without having any Communication with your small Guts; or doing you The least harm in the World. Maff. But, Sir, my Guts are within a hairs breadth of my Buttons, and I'll not venture his Point, so near 'em; I thank ye, if he can teach me without touching me, So; if not, let him keep his Communications to himself. Go call him up, and let none come in else, I charge ye; But carry the Tenants, that wait without to speak with Me into the Buttery, and give 'em Pints a piece of small Beer, to chear their Hearts against they pay their Money. Dill. Sir, there's a pretty young Woman amongst 'em, Must I serve them all alike. Maff. We must be civil to women, Sirrah; now, encourage her Pint with a Gill of Sack, and d'ye hear; tell her, 'twas an especial favour from me. Dill. Out of the Gallon Bottle, that stands by your Bedside, Sir? Maff. Ay, Dunce; what else? Pox on thee get thee; gone, and Send up the Fencing Master. [Exit. Dillon. I have taken a shrew'd opinion, that my being Beaten and kick'd lately, was not so much through my Want of Courage, as want of Skill, in defending My self; and therefore am now resolv'd to learn By Rule and Method, to beat tihs Tarmagant Fellow D'Ambois; as I believe, he has learn't to beat me; for To say the Truth, he did it as readily, as if he had serv'd A Prenticeship, and learn't a Trade of beating People; And therefore, if Art can make a man valiant, I'll Practise hard, but I'll be reveng'd of him; for I am told This Valour is but a meer Trick, after all I have seen One my self, that has Cock'd, huff'd, and look'd as big as If he would have eaten another, at a Morsel; and has Been Cudgel'd by a Third a minute after, and not thought Himself a Jot the worse for't neither. Enter La Foyle. Your Servant, Sir. La Foy. Yours, Sir, Maff. I suppose Sir; you are ignorant why I sent for ye; Therefore before we enter into farther Correspondence, Pray, what is your Name? La Foy. La Foyle, Sir, at your Service. Maff. La Foyle! That's a very good Name for a Fencing Master. And pray, Monsieur La Foyle, how long have you studied this Science? La Foy. Ah! Sir, I almost suck'd it in with my Milk. I had The honour to be employed in the Academy at Rome, At eleven yeas old, where some time after, receiving An Affront, I challenged my Enemy, fought him, whipt Him through the Guts, and killed him, and then [Acts his Speech pushing and striking Maff. Fled into Spain, where meeting with a Courtesan one night when I was drunk, I Made bold to seize her; cut the Fellows Throat that Guarded her; and then with the next shipping came over hither. Maff. Well, well, Good Sir; but pray not too much of your Action,—What a Cut-Throat Son of a Whore have I met with here; 'dsheart, he makes me tremble to hear him. [Aside. La Foy. As to the rest of my Travels, Sir, they are very Quaint and full of Variety, but amongst all places I had The worst success at Venice; the Natives are all there Inclin'd to Luxury and Sloth, and want Mettle to Murder one another handsomely; I was forct there to kill A Man every other Night my self, meerly to force a Trade. Maff. A very pretty Trade indeed; this is the Devil of a Fellow—But you have done none of these handsome Exploits since you came hither, Friend, have you? La Foy. Not yet, Sir; not yet. Maff. No, no, all in good time; Hum! 'dsheart this Rogue Makes no more of killing a Man, than I do of cutting a Corn. [Aside. La Foy. Truly, Sir, Ingenuity must live; I had like to have Signaliz'd my self last Night though, you shall hear How Sir: I went to a Comedy, and intending to Introduce my Parts mildly amongst 'em, I only civilly Pluck'd the next Man, that sat by me, by the Nose. Maff. A great Civility truly; pray go on, Sir. La Foy. Upon this, Sir, he draws, which was the thing I looked for; For instantly, whip was I in with him in Cart thus—clap'd him through the Shoulder, And threw him backwards over the Benches; Slash'd another that was taking his part with A back Blow cross the Face thus—And [Acts his Speech still, kicking and beating, trips Maffe down. Then trip'd up the Heels of a third, that Stood in my way thus; and made my escape in spite of 'em. Maff. Thus, thus, thus, I think the Devils in the Fellow, A Pox can't you tell a Story, but you must break A Man's Bones about it? La Foy. I cry ye Mercy, Sir. Maff. My Mercy; in the Devil's Name; when you have Almost thump'd a Man's Guts out; nay, prithee not A word more, I'de as lieve fight with thee, has hear Thee tell another Story. La Foy. Action is so natural to us, Sir, that sometimes We hardly know whether we are fighting in Earnest, Or relating in Jest. But come, Sir, shall I show ye Any thing, shall I set ye a Lesson? Maff. Why? yes, would willingly you should shew me, If you could, a sure way never to be kill'd; La Foy. I'll don't, Sir; draw. Maff. Draw! what, and be decently whipt through The Guts, as you were saying iust now. Prithee, I'll Not draw, not not I. La Foy. Let the Scabbard be on, Sir. Maff. I'll not trust to that, the Chape may be broke For ought I know, and the Point be amongst my Puddings Before I'm aware; come, come, here are A couple of Bedstaves, these will doe as well. La Foy. Well, Sir; your Guard,—higher a little, keep your Arm streight. Sir; So, Pass, now Pass, Sir; Pass. Maff. Ay, with all my heart. [Goes on to'ther side. La Foy. Pish! I mean, thrust at me,—thus, look ye, [Thumps him. Maff. Thus, look ye; Pox take ye, with a Thump in the Guts agen; prithee where's the Trick all this while? La Foy. Presently, Sir;—your Guard agen; so Parry now, Sir; Parry, Parry, Sir; I'm in your Body else. Maff. The Fellow's mad.— [Thrusts at Maffe, who turns, and runs away. La Foy. Why, Sir; you run away. Maff. 'Tis time to run away, I think, when a man is Like to have a Bedstaff in's Guts. La Foy. There's your Trick, Sir; that's a certain way now, never to Be kill'd now. Maff. I gad, and so 'tis; this is an Arch Rogue, but a Damn'd Bloody minded Dog, for all that. La Foy. Ah, Sir; I have another Trick worth two of this; for Besides my coming to wait on you, I was appointed Here by Count D'Ambois, to show it this afternoon before his Highness. Maff. D'Ambois? [Noise within. La Foy. Ay, Sir; here be hee'r instantly himself: Hark, I think I hear him. Maff. The Devil thou dost, ds'heart, his very Name has Put me into such a trembling, I shall not recover My self this Month; Oh! let me go. La Foy. What! Before you have learn't your Lesson Sir? Maff. Lesson! Prithee don't talk to me of Lessons now; Ay 'tis he, he comes like a Whirldwind. [Noise within. Stand out of my way, don't hinder me; I'm shot like An Arrow, and intend to be at the Indies Within this half hour.— [Runs out, and overthrows, Tables, Stools, and all in's way. Lay. Foy. Ha, ha, ha; Is he safe now? Enter Dillon. Dill. Secure for this Night, I'me sure: And now for the Sack-posset with the Maids. La Foy. Off, my false Beard, and Disguise then. What sayst thou? Did I not Act it rarely? I have beaten the Rogue damnably. Dill. 'Twas admirably done, Faith; for there was no way But this last to get rid of him. [Exeunt. SCENE. III. Enter D'Ambois, Tamira, and Teresia. Tam. Oh! if your Love were ever more than outward; If all your Vows, and Oaths, and soft Endearments, Were not th'Effects of an ungenerous heat, That Broods in Fools, that seek t' undoe poor Women. Be diligent, and search this to the Bottom. For 'tis most certain, that this Devillish Monsieur, Some way or other knows, our close Intrigue. Bussy. What Cold, Dull, Northern Brain, what Fool but he Durst take, like Epimethius, to his Breast A Box of such Plagues, as the Danger yields Incurr'd in the Discovery; he had better Venture his Face to the Consuming blast Of fiercest Lightning, when it rends the Clouds; Or stand the Thunder, which, to purge the Sky, The Cyclops ram, in Jove's Artillery, Tam. The Venome of his Nature; makes him Prophesie And may my Curse, Fill'd with the Poison of a Woman's hate, Torture him for his Labour, if he know it. Pietro. I always thought he dealt with the Devil, for else Which way should he know it, my self being the Only Person concerned; and, I am sure, none knows It by me; for I thank Heaven, I have too much Religion in me, to doe such a mischief. Tam. What further mischief will arise, Heaven knows; But I am still th'unhappy Cause of all. Bussy. Call not thy self unhappy, if my Love Was ever grateful to thee, by thy Beauty, The unvalued Banquet that do's feast my Soul, And all the Joys that swell'd my panting Heart, When, Angel-like, thou gav'st a taste of Heaven, I cannot hear thee blame that Precious Minute, Or show the least repining, without trouble. Tam. How innocent was I, when first I lov'd, How much reserv'd and Chaste my Inclinations! But Fate, alas is strong, and Women weak. And if the learn'd Philosophers say true, None e're can keep a constant Course in Vertue; What's now, alike in all parts, every day Differs from other, nay, each Hour and Minute; Ay, every Thought in our false Clock of Life. Wastes the unvalued Treasure of our Time, Our Bodies are but thick Clouds to our Souls, Through which they cannot shine, when they desire; Nay, all the Stars, and even the Sun himself, Must wait the motion of the humid Vapours, Which he himself exhales; else 'twere impossible, He ever should disperse his Beams to us: How then can, we that are but Motes to him, Wandring like Attoms in his dazling Rays, Overcome our sollid Passions? Bussy. 'Tis impossible, Nor did wise Providence design we should: But having given Free-will, it self stand Neuter, To see how Mortals wear their Jewel, Reason. Tam. Oh! but I fear the wrong done to my Husband. Bussy. Thy Husband! that's to me, I am thy Husband; The Man to whom thy first dear Vows were plighted, Mountsurry, a vile and Irreligious Robber, That breaking to my Garden, stole my Fruit, Devour'd my Eyes, my Lips, my Breast, my Heart, With an unsanctified Voracious Appetite, Gorg'd on ripe Beauty blushing on the Bow, E're I had time to taste my own first blessings. And can'st thou have the Heart to call him Husband, Before my Face, that has thus wrong'd thy Husband? Recant, Recant, and by Love's mighty Power I Charge thee henceforth, style him so no more. Tam. Oh! thou dear Charmer of my too fond Heart, I cannot blame thee, though thou hast undone me; My Soul is so possessed with the strong Passion. [Call Mountsurry, Monsieur, and Guise. And all my Powers, tend so much towards it, That I can forfeit Vertue, Fame, and Honour, To run, and Sacrifice my self to thee; And since my Fate designs me for a Sacrifice, As by my Boding Fears, I find it does, Know I will die for thee without a Murmur: And Fame shall sing aloud, none ever fell So unconcern'd as I, or lov'd so well; Bussy. Can the dear Soul of all I wish in Life, Talk to me thus of Death, and I so near her? No, I have brav'd the meagre Feind so often, He not dares touch one precious Grain of thee; Or think it Savours of Mortality. And for the Monsieur, I'll watch like his ill Genius; A Politician should like Lightning melt The very Marrow, and not taint the Skin. Thus Policy must be flanck'd with Policy, And Henry still be safe; if then meer Loyalty Can me to Acts past Mortal daring move; I'll combat like a God to aid my Love. Tam. Hark, Oh! Curst hour, my Lord's return'd. [Noise within. Mont. Where are ye? Open the Door. [Mountsurry within. Bussy. 'Tis Montsurry's Voice; I'll stay and claim my Right Before his Face. Tam. Oh! for my sake; Love, think not such a Thought; Away, away, into the Vault; nay, instantly, If you love me;—if any ill happens I'll Write ye word. Bussy. Doe, and be sure of safety. Pietro. Come, come, let's be gone; Lord help us, what a Stir's here! [They descend the Vault. Tamira takes a Book in her hand. Tam. Come holy Cover of all humane frailty, lend— Thy Assistance; Godliness now shine In Hypocrites most Vice looks most Divine, Whilst Crimes lie hid, to Heaven we nothing say; But when we fear to be found out, we Pray. Enter Montsurry, Monsieur, and Guise. [Opens the Door. Mont. What! are ye Conjuring, ye are lock'd so close? Tam. The Monsieur here, and Guise; Oh! I am lost. [aside. I hope you'l allow time for Devotion. Mont. Devotion! the Visor of Hypocrisie. Mons., Guis. Ah, ah, ah, ah. [Call Charlot Letter. Tam. Who look ye for, my Lord? Mont. Some kind Assistant, that perhaps might help You in your Devotions. Mons. Heaven may be spoke with privately, without these Locks and Barring up of Doors Tam. Oh! my dear Lord, do not Relapse agen Into your bad Suspicions. Mont. Get ye gone, let me have none of your fawning; Now, be gone, I say. Tam. I know my Duty, and am all Obedience. [Exit. Mont. Oh! Modesty, where wilt thou shew thy Beauty, If it be wanting in that lovely Look. Guis. Craft, Craft; my Lord all Craft. Mons. 'Tis a Damn'd subtil Game, they are all skill'd at; Their Looks are their Trump Cards, with which they win, Of Fools, whate'r they Play for. Enter Charlotte, with a Letter. Here comes one Will pull the Vizor off, and Clear your Eye-sight: Now, dear Charlotte, hast thou stole out the Letter? Charl. I have don't, my Lord; but I vow, I half repent it; I stole her Cabinet keys out, whilst she slept, And found this Paper, but could hardly bring it, So Conscious was I of my Treachery. Mons. Treachery! Fidelity by this Light, and shall be so rewarded; Come prithee let's see't. [takes the Letter. Guis. What! is't a Billet-deux? Mons. A Copy of the last, she sent her Minion. Mont. Can it be possible? Mons. There, my Lord— There is a Glass of Ink, where you may see How to make ready black Fac'd Tragedy; That Scrowl displays her Heart, naked and bare, And pulls the Veil off, that so long abus'd ye. Mont. Her own damn'd hand, I swear! Charl. I beseech your Lordship, let it be a Secret, Mons. Oh! Ay, a Secretes Secret, as thy Maiden-head, Never fear it. Charl. And will your Highness be pleas'd to remember The Knight? Mons. The Knight! why, he is just putting on his Spurs, And coming Post; What! dost think I forget? Charl. Your Highness shall be always welcome to Our house, and in what I can oblige your Highness, I beseech ye command. Mons. Well, well; I am oblig'd to thee; but prithee leave Us now a little, we have some private Business. Guis. Nothing remains, my Lord, but the strange means [Exit Charl. They have to meet, which to find out 'tis fit, We bribe the old Governess. Mont. Oh! Crocodile, Hiana, monstrous Traitress! Mons. All Railing is but vain, do your self Justice A better way; and since the close Conveyance, And which way he got to her is unknown, Force her to write my Lord a tender Letter, To invite D'Ambois to a Midnight meeting. Guise. Do so, my Lord, cry first To make her name her Bawdy Messenger, That manages th'Affair, that subtle Pander, That passes all our Study to find out; Then let her write, and d'Ambois comes i'th'instant, Within the thirsty reach of your Revenge: I'th'interim lodge an Ambush in her Chamber, Behind the Hangings, of your Stoutest Men, All close and surely arm'd, and let 'em share A Soul amongst 'em that will serve a Thousand. Mont. His Fate is cast, but what's his single Fate? Methinks the Frame of the whole World should crack, To see its parts so disproportionate: But why Rove I far? here, here, was she, That was a whole World without Spot to me: Tho now a World of Spots, Oh! what a Flash Is Mans Delight in Woman; what a Bubble He builds his State, Peace, Life on when he Marries: Since then Earths Pleasures are so short and small, To be most Happy is t'abjure them all; Detest a Joy so often proves our Shame, And never trust False Woman with our Fame. [Exeunt. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter Montsurry dragging in Tamira with hair dishevel'd after them Teresia. Tam. Oh! do not kill me Husband. Mont. Cease to be Obstinate, and I may find my Temper: Will you write? Ter. For Heavens sake, my Lord, be not so Cruel. Mont. Oh! trouble not your Charity with my Cruelty, This course I must take for my Honours sake, Till she obeys, and faithfully discloses Who was the secret Manager of this matter. Ter. Oh! 'tis a horrid work to pursue those Secrets; More Mischiefs may arise from such curs'd Knowledge: Nor is't a Path for Christian Feet to tread; But out of all way to the Health of Souls; A Sin impossible to be forgiven. My Lord, you will be Damn'd if you proceed. Mont. Reverend Religion, prithe hold thy peace, And tell not me of Damning; get thee gone, For fear my Passion should forget thy Age. Away, I say, I shall not break the limits of a Man, Till she turn to a Devil. Tam. Be gone, good Governess, my Lord will hear me. Ter. Well, Heaven inspire ye both, I'll go and pray for ye. [Exit Ter. Mont. Who shall remove this Mountain from my Breast [Mont. locks the door. Or stand the opening Furnace of my Thoughts, Or lend fit Outcries for a Soul in Hell; For nothing now is fit to speak my Griefs But Thunder, were the Wind blown from my Throat, Loud as the Trump of Heaven, whose Sacred Blast Must unite moulder'd Earth, and wake the Dead, I could not vent enough my Horrid Woes. Tam. My Lord, my Fault, perhaps, as you are told it With too strong Arguments, is past your pardon; But how the Circumstances may excuse me, May yet appear, and my true Penitence Hereafter, move your Pity. Mont. Hereafter! 'tis a suppos'd Infinite, That from this Point will rise Eternally, When a feign'd Vertue is discover'd Vice. Excuses, Damn her! they, like Fires in Cities, Enrage with those Winds that less Lights extinguish. Sing, Syren, Sing, and dash against my Rock, [Pulls her by the hair. Thy Ruffian Gally burnt with flaming Lust. Sing, I mean write, and then take from my Eyes, The Mists that hide the most instructable Pander That ever lap'd up an Adulterous Vomit, That I may see the Devil and Survive, That I may hang him, and then cut him down, Then Rip him up, and with true Cunning search The Cells and Cabins of his Brain and Study, Like him the Wilderness of a Womans Heart, Where half the World that venture in are lost. Oh! wretched Man, that still will haunt the Coast Of Fatal Marriage, and hunt the dear-bought Game, Till he does find within his Wives two Breasts, All Pelion and Cythæron with their Beasts, Will ye write yet— [Dragging her. Tam. Oh! let me not, Dear Lord, In lieu of my great Faults Ingender greater, And make the suppos'd Breach of Vows cause Murder. Mont. It follows needfully, as Child and Parent, The Chain-shot of thy Vice is still aloft, And it must Murder, 'tis thy own dear Twin, None e'er could add height to a Womans Sin. Tam. Why did you Marry me? Mont. Controling Fate design'd it for my Curse. Tam. Your Griefs were small, 'tis I have felt the worst. Mont. I thought your Heart my own, and wish'd no more. Tam. My Heart, alas, 'twas given long, long before. Mont. The greater still thy Mischief—will you write? For it must be, or by this Fatal Steel, That here shall do me Justice, and the Rage Thy Obstinacy breeds within my Bosom, I'll be a Year a killing thee. Tam. Oh! enjoyn my Sin, A worser Pennance and I'll bear it patiently; Hide in some gloomy Dungeon my loath'd Face, And let Condemned Murderers let me down, Stopping their Noses my Abhorred Food; Hang me in Chains, and let me eat their Arms That have offended; bind me Face to Face To some Dead Body, taken from the Cart Of Execution, till Death and Time To grains of Dust dissolve me; Or any Torture that your worst Invention Can fright all Pity from the World withall; But to betray a Friend with show of Friendship, Is such a baseness I can ne'er consent to: Be Cruel as you please, here are my Breasts, Last night your Pillows, here my wreathed Arms, Lately the dear lov'd Confines of your Life, Now use 'em as you please— Mont. Oh! do not touch me, they have now no Charm, Thy Arms have lost their Priviledge by Lust, And in their Torture thus, thus, they must pay it [wounds her. Tam. Oh! Heaven— Mont. Till thou writest I'll write in wounds my wrongs fit Characters. Will ye yet do't?— [Wounds her again. Tam. Oh kill me! kill me! Dear Husband, be not Crueller than Death; You have beheld some Gorgon, feel, Oh feel! How you are turn'd to Stone with my Hearts Blood; Dissolve your self again, or you will grow Into the Image of all Tyranny. Mont. As thou art of Adultery, I will ever Prove thee my Parollel, being most a Monster; Thus I express thee— [Wounds her again. Tam. Oh! who is turn'd into my Lord, my Husband, Or have I none? Oh! will this Dreadful Vision Last then for ever? Help me, ye Powers above, And pitying Saints, help me, Oh! help me Husband. Mont. VVrite, or I'll be more Cruel in thy Death Than Tyranny can utter— [Ragingly. Teresia ascends from the Vault. Ter. Save, Save her Life, and take the Fatal Secret. Mon. Hah! Ghosts and Goblins; If thou art Air my Dagger cannot hurt thee. [Stabs Ter. Tam. Oh! what have you done? Mont. I know not, killed the Devil I think—Hah— VVhat's here, th'old Governess? Tam. The same, the same— Mont. Author of Prodigies; A Thunder-bolt breaks from the Firmament, And Plows up Counsels never known before: Now is it true, Earth moves and Heaven stands stands still, And the whole Course of Nature is disorder'd; VVas this the way, was she the Imp between ye? Tam. She was, she was, kind faithful wretch, she was. Mont. VVhy well said Sanctity, I'm undeceiv'd By this, in what I never had believ'd; This Praying Saint, that talk'd of nought but God, I'th'midst of strong Devotion was a Bawd; They're all, they're all just so, the VVeed Hypocrisie, Spreads over all the Earth, and Buds and Blossoms; 'Tis Rank, 'tis Rank; come, come, will you write now? Tam. Oh mighty Love! whilst I had strength to bear, I have oppos'd, but now my Fainting Spirits Yield up their Powers; I will write my Lord, But it shall be in Blood, that he may see The Lines came from my wounds, and not from me. [Writes. Mont. Since it is so, why will the Priests take pains To tell us of Rewards for being Good; Since Vice is Sickness Epidemical, And curs'd Hypocrisie swayes Humane Nature; Since no one can be Just, nor so rewarded, There's no such thing as Justice or Reward. [He reads her writing. Tam. Oh my hard Fate!— Mont. 'Tis well, and now Charlott shall be the Messenger, I'll to her straight, and court her with a Bribe; Come Grannum, you must lye a while conceal'd In this dark Cave, wherein I'll enter too, To see the Hellish Cavern; methinks the odd Adventure Revives, and teaches me no more to Mourn. Tam. And me to curse the Hour that I was born. SCENE II. Enter d' Ambois, and Magician. Mag. Since long you have Intrusted to my Care, A Secret of such weighty Consequence; I will at your Request unfold my Art, And leave no point, to help you in distress. Bus. Thanks, Honour'd Father, Oh! if I were alone, The Mark at which the Fates intend to shoot, I would not trouble Art, to give fore-knowledg; But, 'tis alas! for safety of my Love. My dear Tamira, that I seek this Secret, And therefore do Implore your choicest Skill, To show the Plots of subtle Guise and Monsieur. Mag.

My Spirits are Exhal'd, the Air's so hot, As there had been a hellish Legion here; Speak Father, speak my Fate, I am prepar'd. Mag. Oh! thou great Prince of Shades, where never Sun Strikes his farr darted Beams, whose Eyes are made To shine in Darkness, and see ever best, Where Men are Blindest, open now my Breast, And let my Tongue, Interpret what was shown. Bus. What will befall me, and my dearest Mistriss? Mag. When ere thou seest her Face next, thou shalt dye, Bus. Oh! Cruel Destiny, that I must dye? By what gives Light, and Life to all the World, But say then barbarous Oracle, is there then No way left to prevent it? Mag. There is none, Bus. Who is it can hinder such a Grace? Mag. Fate and its cruel Ministers; Bus. Who are Fates Ministers? Mag. The Guise and Monsieur. Bus. A fit pair of Shears To Cut the Threads of Kings and Kingly Spirits. Mag. Yet 'tis decreed, that Sword, Poyson, nor Dagger Shall never hurt thee, but still thou art not safe; I am control'd, and dare disclose no more, farewell. [Exit. Mag. Bus. Nor Steel, nor Poyson, What then can I fear? My Mistrisses Face, where Beauty lies and Smiles, A Thousand Thousand Charms to chear my Vallour; Pish these are Dreams, and this Old doting Wizard, Not knowing with what Purity she Loves, Believes that she'll be Treacherous and kill me; Who's this? Enter Charlot with a Letter. Char. I hope my Business with your Lordship, May well Excuse th'Intrusion; Bus. I guess from whom, but how came you the Messenger? Char. The Governess has catch'd cold, my Lord, the rest You'l know by the Contents. Bus. What Writ in Blood? Char. Yes, 'tis the Ink of Lovers? Bus. Oh! 'Tis a Sacred witness of her Truth, So much Elixir of her Blood as this, Would make a being and Regenerate Death: Oh! How it Multiplies my Blood with Spirits, And makes me fit t'Incounter Fate and Hell; Away dear Creature, be my happy Guide, And on the Wings of Love, let me fly to her. [Exeunt SCENE III. Enter Monsieur, Guise, Montsurry, and Murderers. Mont. Charlot by this time must be coming back, Are ye all Armed and Ready? Murd. All, all my Lord, Guise. Speed us then Vengeance; Mont. Resolve my Masters, you will meet with one, Will try what Proof your privy Coats are made on, But let not that defer your promis'd Action, But when he's Enter'd, and you hear the Sign, Approach, and make all sure. Murd. Ne'er doubt, my Lord, we'l make him tame enough; Mont. And now upon my Sweet Revenge, I'll Feast Love like a Razor Cleanses being well us'd, But fetches Blood still, being least abus'd. [Exeunt. Enter Tamira. Tam. When will my Mortal Griefs be at their height, And Time assure a Period to my Sorrows. Oh! Who can look upon this Stage of Fate, VVhere my dear Bussy must be Sacrific'd, VVithout Convulsions of Heart-killing VVoes; Have I a Heart, and can I see his Bleed, Have I a Soul, and can I fail to hinder This Dam'd Design; VVhat a weak helpless thing Is wreatched VVoman; all our Powers to Live, Is given to no End, but t' have Power to Grieve. He Comes, he Comes, the precious Victim Comes, And I alas! have nothing but this Dagger left, And my weak Cries to help him, or my self. [Shows a Dagger. d' Ambois and Charlot, Assend from the Vault. Away, Away my Love, thou wilt be Murder'd. Bus. Murder'd, I know not what that Hebrew means, There had been no such word were all like d' Ambois. Tam. The Letter sent, was forc'd, that wicked Trait'ress, Brib'd by my Lord, betrays thee to thy Death. Bus. Betray'd to Death; Out Stinking Taper, thou shalt never see it; VVhere are these Bravo's, hah! by Heaven. [Kills Charlot. He is my Murderer that shows me not a Murderer; 'Tis a word the Noble Heart of Vallour does Abhor, Murder'd, who dares in all the Space I see, Come in my Reach, or look with Equal force My Rage in the Face, upon whose Hand sits Death, VVhose Sword has VVings, and every Feather pierces; If I escape Monsieurs Pothecarys Shops, Foutir for Guises Shambles, 'twas ill Plotted; They should have Mawl'd me here VVhen I was Rising, I am up and ready, Let in my Politick Visitants, let 'em in, Fate is more strong than Arms, more fierce than Treason, And I at all Points, Arm'd by Love and Courage. Enter Monsieur, and Guise Disguis'd, and Murderers. [They all fall upon d' Ambois, who kills some, and beats out the rest, all but Monsieur and Guise.] Mont. Come all at once. Tam. Oh! Cowards, barbarous Villains? Guise. Come not they on, Bus. No Slaves, nor go off; I'll see what Heroes Masque there in Disguises. Mon. Death we are finely snap'd. [Fights with Guise and Mon. Bus. Stand ye so firm, will it not Enter here, You have an Eye left still. [Disarms Monsieur, and gets the better of Guise, when Three or Four Attack him behind, whom he Kills, Monsieur and Guise Escape out.] Bus. Chear up my Love, see I am Heart-hole still; Thou art my Buckler, and I fear no Numbers. Tam. Oh! Shame of Honour in the Guise [Embrasing her. And Monsieur. Bus. VVhich were they? Tam. Those in Disguise my Lord, that just went off. Bus. Oh! Curs'd, Curs'd, Fate, had I but known the Fiends, Not all the Powers of Heaven and Earth had sav'd 'em; But where's this Angry Count, Come forth my Lord, And shew your own Face in your own Affair; Take not into your Noble Veins, the Blood Of these base Villains, nor the light reports Of blister'd Tongues, for clear and weighty Truths, But Come and Charge me here, who will defend VVith my last drop of Blood, your wrong'd Lady, Against the VVorld; And to whose Injur'd Fame, I stand here as a Bulwork, and proclaim Long Life to her Renown, that ever yet Has been untainted even in Envies Eyes. Come forth, for shame, and keep your Fear from knowledge; 'Tis not my fault if you don't clear your Blot, Nor Revenge yours, if you perform it not. Enter Montsurry. Mont. Twelve Villains and afraid t'attack one Fury; Since then thou art a Devil, I will try If I can Conjure thee. [They fight, and d'Ambois has Mont. down. Bus. That's bravely said— Tam. Oh! save my Lord, my Love, for my sake, Save him. Bus. I will not touch him, take your Life, my Lord, And be appeas'd: [They rush out behind him, and with [Pistols shoot him; he falls. Ah! then the Coward Fates Have Maim'd themselves, and ever lost their Honours. Tam. Oh! Bloody, Cruel Men, what have you done? Bus. The Chance is thrown, and the Old Wizzards Riddle, That told I should be safe from Sword, Drug, Dagger, Is now resolv'd, yet shall my Fame Survive The Date of time, and 'tis enough for me, That Guise and Monsieur's Death and Destiny, Come behind d'Ambois; is my Body then But penetrable Stuff, and must my mind Follow my Blood; can my Divine part add No Aid to th'Earthly in Extremity. Oh! for one pretious hour of spritely Life, To kill these Foxes I so oft have Earth'd And I will give my Soul up with a Smile; But Fate has bound me fast, turn then to Heaven, And like a Man look upwards even in Death; And if Vespatian thought in Majesty, An Emperor might dye standing, why not I? Nay without help, in which I will exceed him; Prop me, true Sword, as thou hast ever done. [Gets up. The Equal thought I bear of Life and Death, Shall let me Faint on no side, I am up, Here like a Roman Statue I will stand, Till Death has made me Marble. Guise. Since nothing, but your Death would build our Peace, 'Twill now show Noble in ye to forgive. Bus. I do, and on predestinated Fate, Throw all your Ills into't with Charms of Spirit: And now, my Lord, let this my weighty Blood, [To Mont. Laid in one Scale of your more partial Spleen, O'ersway my late unwarrantable Love VVeigh'd in the other, and be reconcil'd VVith all Remorse to your unhappy Lady. Tam. Oh! pardon me, dear Sir, and this base Hand That train'd your Life to this unhappy end; The Blood that stain'd that most accursed Paper, In which I writ the Summons of your Death, VVas all forc'd from me, from this bleeding wound; From this here in my Bosom, and from this That makes me hold up both my hands embrewed Thus for your pardon. Burs. Oh! my Heart is broken: Fate nor these Murderers, Monsieur nor the Guise, Have any Triumph in my Death but this; This killing Spectacle, this Prodigy; Oh! Frail Condition of Strength, Valour, Vertue; Oh! that my Eyes could prove two Basilisks, And dart into your Breasts my Fatal Vengeance; Ye barbarous Tygers, by my hopes of Heaven, For that one Moment I'd forego my Peace. All Heroes then I should in Death out-do, And purchase-Heaven my self for Damning you. [Dyes. Tam. Farewel, Dear Reliques of the bravest Man That ever trod upon this Globe of Misery, Thou art at Peace, nor will I long be from thee; As in a Glass let Cruel Parents see, The Consequence of parting Souls by me: Oh! had their Lenity first given my Hand, Where first my Heart was given. this Fatal hour Had never been, my Fame had been unspotted; My Husband not deceiv'd, nor I undone; But Fate has emptied all her Store of Darts, Destroy'd a perfect Love, and broke both Hearts. Mont. Come, let's away, my Senses are not proof Against her Moans. Guise. Forgive her, good my Lord, since your Revenge Has wip'd out all Offences, 'twill be Manly To suffer Reconcilement. Mons. Death has atton'd for Reputation lost, And now she's clear again. Mont. I do forgive her, and do ask her Pardon For my late passionate and unmanly Riggor; I wish too that we could be reconcil'd, But Honour bars all further Conversation, For as this Taper, tho it upwards look, Downwards must needs Consume, so must our Love; Or as when first the Flame looks spritely upwards, It keeps its Luster, but being thus turn'd down, Its natural Course of useful light inverted, Its own Stuff puts it out, so must our Love; Turn then from me, as here I turn from thee, And may both Points of th'Worlds great Axis be, Conjoyn'd in one before thy self and me. Tam. Stay yet a Minute longer, stay my Lord, There's something to be done for both our Honours; My Niggard Parents gave my Hand to you, But Ah my Heart was still another's due; A Love so perfect gain'd, I had not skill, Tho much I strove to overcome my Will: Now then, to give you liberty to fly From your loath'd Yoke, I thus the Knot unty; [Stobs her self. From all the Marriage Plagues my self I free, And uncontrol'd return, Dear Love, to thee. [Dies. Mons. Curs'd Resolution— Guise. Wrest the Dagger from her. Mont. 'Tis too late, she's gone, she's gone for ever, And I distracted with the unlucky Chance; What's to be done? Fate rains too fast upon us, 'Tis time now to seek Shelter. Mons. Let's retire From this ill-fated place to Consultation, For all our Powers and Friends are yet too few To stand the dreadful Shock of Henry's Anger, When he shall hear his Eagle is destroy'd: Let us then make a strong and solemn Vow, To stand together with our Lives and Fortunes, And vouch his Fall to be th'Effect of Chance. Thus far we prove, and 'tis a Maxim strong, No Favourite liv'd Happy that liv'd long.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. When Infant Wit was in its tender years, And kind Spectators us'd their Hands and Ears; When nought to Plays did a large Audience draw But Pleasure, and to laugh at what they saw; That was the Golden Age, for Poets then Were in the Ranck of the uncommon Men: But now the Times are so Reform'd and Wise, The Satyrs Wholsome Relish you despise, And like great School-boys to their Lessons kept, You think your selves too big now to be Whipt. But since the Ladies your Examples are, Regale for once on Common Lenten Fare; Our Author too, the Roman Vote does wish, And hope they'll not cry down the Lenten Dish, Because at present they're confin'd to Fish: All Poets nat'rally on their side appear, Do what they can, the Times are so severe, The Muses keep strict Lent all round the Year. Pray spare ill Nature now, and let me say, That I have courted ye to like a Play, I may serve you as much another way. Writers sometimes may Interest want, But something's in a Female Supplicant, The Learned tell us, that can never fail To move the kindly Nature of the Male: Our Tragick Scenes are not obscurely laid, But that a Moral use may well be made; For in this Glass ye all without mistaking, May see the dangerous Crime of Cuck old-making. FINIS.</field>
