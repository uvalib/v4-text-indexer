      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A sheltered Valley in Mexico. On one Side a Cottage. Enter Teutile. TEUTILE. Welcome once again, ye blest paternal bow'rs! How gladly do I greet ye, when at eve, My simple labours ended, I return To share that bounty which benignant heav'n Pours down on virtuous toil.â (Shouts are heard.) What sounds are those? Again they riseâand now they seem approaching. Enter Tacuba and Otumba. TACUBA. This way their course they bent. Methought I saw them Ent'ring the grove which skirts this narrow vale. OTUMBA. But there we lost them.âFather, hast thou seen Two fugitives? Their mien and garb are strange, Their heads adorn'd with shining casques, surmounted With shaggy trophies, and their bodies arm'd With strange metallic coatsâ TEUTILE. I saw them not; Yet heard I shouts of war, that seem'd to shake The neighb'ring hills and woods. What stirs ye thus? TACUBA. Hast thou not heard, how lately on our coasts, Convey'd in huge machines with wings, to which The mighty condor's shew but as a speck, Arriv'd a pow'rful host of warlike strangers? Who they may be, or whence they come, we know not, But dreadful seem their faculties: some bear The forms of men, yet not of men like us; While others, monsters of an unknown kind, With hoofs far-sounding scour across the plain, And bear destruction whereso'er they turn. TEUTILE. Of fearful prodigies ye tell, and strange. OTUMBA. More fearful yet have they approv'd themselves. For arms they bear long spears, whose ends surcharg'd With some hard substance strike with fatal aim; And tubes they have of yet more dire effect, Whence issue flames and death. TEUTILE. And are their natures As dreadful as their aspect? TACUBA. Sterner yet. Ferocious are they as the forest tiger; They seek for gold as if it were their food, And quench their thirst with blood. TEUTILE. If such they be, And so superior are their means of mischief, How is't that thus, instead of flying from them, So eagerly you follow up their course? TACUBA. As in array they march'd across our hills, Some ten or twelve, attracted by our dwellings, Remain'd behind their host. With fell intent They rush'd upon us; to our straw-clad roofs Their flaming torches they applied: nor sex, Nor ageânot infancy itself they spar'd. OTUMBA. But on their heads their crimes we well aveng'd. Awhile their mailed coats withstood our weapons; But soon of those who had oppos'd our vengeance All fell, save two, whom now we hope to find. They cannot far be distant.âFare thee well, And pray for our success.âNow to o'ertake them! [Exeunt Tacuba and Otumba. TEUTILE. Hide, hide thyself, oh sun! Let not thy beams Witness such dread enormities.âAlas! Too true an emblem art thou of our state: Like thee, forth bursting from thine eastern bed, We wake to life, and all surrounding nature Seems deck'd with loveliness and coming joy; Like thee ambitiously we make our progress, Now splendid, now by passing clouds obscur'd, Now our beams shorn by overwhelming tempests; Like thee at length, our toilsome journey past, We sink in darkness, and are seen no more.â Defend me, gracious pow'rs! What forms are those Hither advancing? Are they men or spirits? Alas! too sure they are of human sort, And mortal as myself. One of them's woundedâ Are these the strangers whom our youth pursue?â Hither they comeâI will retire and watch them. [He goes aside. Enter Gonsalvo and Alvarado. GONSALVO. Soâgentlyâlean on me, my Alvarado. ALVARADO. Alas, Gonsalvo! from this gaping wound Ebbs the last remnant of departing life. I can no moreâIs there no friendly turf, On which I may repose my stiff'ning limbs? GONSALVO. Hereârest beneath this shadeâI will watch o'er thee. Where in this desert can I look for succour, For some kind hand to mitigate thy sufferings? ALVARADO. Give me some water to assuage my thirst. GONSALVO. No stream flows here. Perhaps within yon grove, Where fresher seems the herbage, I may findâ Hark! heard'st thou not a sound?âSome one approachesâ Is it some new assailant hot for vengeance? Some Indian yet unsated with our blood? TEUTILE (advancing). Stranger, whoe'er thou artâBut wherefore thus Draw forth thy weapon? Why dost start to view me? Can danger daunt thee, wretched as thou art? GONSALVO. Thou chid'st me fairly. For a wretch like me, 'Twere better to forego at once a life, Which holds out nought but perspectives of woe. I fear not for myself: the stroke which ends me Cuts off at most some years of want and pain, And should be welcom'd. But I have a friend, Compar'd with whose distresses mine are small. Good Indian! If thou'st ever felt compassionâ TEUTILE. Art thou not one of those of whom I heard, Who, unprovok'd, have landed on our coast, And spread destruction 'mid our peaceful tribes? GONSALVO. I dare not palliate our offence: 'tis rankâ But let not now thy vengeance be extreme, For mis'ry presses on us. When thou see'st A poor defenceless fellow creature, cast A suppliant on thy mercy, think oh! think Of his distressful state, and pity him. TEUTILE. He listen'd not to pity. GONSALVO. Did high heav'n From ev'ry sinful man withhold it's mercy, Who should find favour?âAs thou art a man, As thou hast eyes to see, and heart to feel, Aid me to bear him to some safe retreat. TEUTILE. Thou mov'st me strangelyâBut it may not be. Thou hast confess'd thyself my country's foe: He too, who justly suffers for his crimesâ GONSALVO. We cannot harm thee now; and, if we could, Thy kindness would disarm us.âLook on himâ He's no one's enemy nowâThe hand of death Presses hard on him. I will kneel to theeâ TEUTILE. Arise, poor youth! Thy pleading half unmans me. I have a cot, where I could shelter theeâ GONSALVO. Oh let it shield us from impending danger! The works of charity are ne'er forgotten, But, when thou most may want them, will avail thee. TEUTILE. My judgment checks me, but my heart prevails. Thou shalt not perish. I will succour thee. Assist to bear thy comrade to my cot. How wan and pale he looks! He gazes on us, And tries to speak, but cannot. GONSALVO. Gently move him. TEUTILE. Now onâThis way, my sonâSoâbear him in. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A wild mountainous Country. Enter Cortez, Velasquez and Soldiers. CORTEZ. Thus far, in spite of all surrounding perils, Our daring enterprize hath well advanc'd. To-morrow's sun shall lead us on to conquest: Proud Mexico, which o'er her subject lake In tow'ring majesty exalts her head, Shall vail her glories and confess our sway. What say'st thou now, Velasquez? Dost thou now Regret the navy, which on yonder shore With minds determin'd we consign'd to flames? VELASQUEZ. Cortez! when first thou spok'st of thy resolve To bar all transit from this western world, I scann'd alone the risk which might attend A plan so bold and daring; now I feel Thy better wisdom, and pursue thy fortunes. CORTEZ. Doubt not their issue. Hath not Zempoalla, With all her tribes, our victor standards join'd? Some fav'ring spirit seems to guide our march, And point the way to empire, wealth and fame. Enter Salceda. Salceda! welcome. Say, from Tlascala What tidings bear'st thou? Do her chiefs refuse Our proffer'd friendship, or, impress'd with awe, Submit they like the rest, and grace our triumph? SALCEDA. I know not which, but shortly thou wilt learn. To meet thee here, Telasco, their cacique, Advances with his host. CORTEZ. Soft ye awhileâ Was it not he, of whom in Zempoalla Of late we heard? SALCEDA. The same. CORTEZ. Who sought the hand Of Montezuma's sister, and who since, His suit rejected by her haughty brother, Th' imperial court had sullenly relinquish'd? SALCEDA. So said our new allies. CORTEZ. Comes he to meet us? Let himâ'tis wellâif in his soul still lodge The ranc'rous feelings which he lately nourish'd, They haply may be turn'd to our advantage. 'Tis worth experiment.âMarches he quickly? SALCEDA. He bad me hasten hither, to announce His speedy coming. CORTEZ. Here then we'll await him. These civil broils promote our great design. Is this Telasco like those other chieftains, On whose unpractis'd minds we have prevail'd? SALCEDA. Expect not so to find him. He appears Cast in a rougher mould. A bolder savage, Or one on whom the hand of nature stamps A character more firm, I have not seen. CORTEZ. 'Tis wellâbut hark! O'er yonder rugged hills Already bursts his uncouth minstrelsyâ And see, descending from their beetling summits, In rude array his forces bend their march. Throughout our host immediate orders issue To hold themselves prepar'd.âThat must be heâ He bears indeed a brave and gallant aspectâ Enter Telasco and Soldiers. TELASCO. Arrest your march!âAre these the wond'rous strangers, Who, borne on flying castles o'er the main, And arm'd with thunder, are arriv'd among us? Where is the daring leader of your host? CORTEZ. Renown'd cacique! I hail thy welcome presence. Behold in me the messenger of good, Who 'cross the foaming waves have held my course, To plant amid your tribes our holy faith, And spread among you Europe's arts and knowledge. TELASCO. Thy faith we heed not, and thy arts we scorn. What can'st thou teach us?âCan'st thou make us stronger? Can'st thou instruct us how to face the tiger, To twang the bowâto hurl the spearâto dare Our foes, or bravely vindicate our rights? These are our arts, and these we know already. CORTEZ. As yet we're strangers to thee. More acquaintance Will prove what are our faculties. I'll shew thee, Ere thou depart'st, the wonders of our pow'r, How at our will around us light'nings fly, How we can rouse the thunder's pealing voice, And with death-dealing energy o'erthrow Whole legions of our foes array'd in arms. TELASCO. Art thou a god, and these thy ministers? Lo! if thou art, and if propitious be Thy purposes, I'll bring thee store of gold, Perfumes and gems. If thou be mortal man, I'll lay before thee fruits to nourish thee, Garments to screen thee from the sun's fierce ray, And plumage to adorn thee. CORTEZ. No, cacique! We boast not godlike pow'r, but by heav'n's favour We have those rights, and that pre-eminence, Which thou wilt shortly learn to recognize. We have no hostile purposes; our wish Is to establish lasting friendship with you. TELASCO. If then ye're men, and mercy be your nature, What leads you thus 'gainst Mexico to march? CORTEZ. We come, by Europe's pow'rful monarch charg'd, To seek th' alliance of your Indian prince. Should he receive us courteously, we mean As friends with equal courtesy to greet him: Should he oppose us, then our king's command With our good arms we doubt not to inforce. TELASCO. Whatâwith a force like thine, a handful merely, T'encounter with his myriads?âLook to it wellâ Think'st thou that he, before whose rule e'en I, Aye I, Telasco, bend, will crouch to thee? Away, away!âLike the thin rack that flits O'er heav'n's expanse, and vanishes to nothing, When from his chamber in the glowing east The sun in radiant majesty bursts forth, Thy puny armament will melt before himâ CORTEZ. I value not his myriads. Let him draw them From ev'ry quarter of his wide domain, Unaw'd would I encounter him. I've pow'rs, Which yet he knows not of, but soon will learn, That render me invincible. Yet wish I In milder guise my mission to perform, 'Bove all with thee. I ask thy friendship, chief. I am no common man, nor is my proffer Of slight avail. I can redress the wrongs Which thou from Montezuma hast sustain'dâ TELASCO. Where heard'st thou of my wrongs? CORTEZ. Thou'rt yet to learn Our wond'rous faculties. Let those, who dar'd Provoke our vengeance, tell thee of our prowess. They witness'd and have felt it. Yet 'tis nothing To the surpassing energies wherewith We are by nature blest. The past, the future, Alike are present to us; earth and sea Confess our lordly sway; the elements Of air and fire are to our voice obedient. Far as the region, where with vivid ray From the vast deep the sun his orb displays, Our dwelling lies; yet not from us conceal'd Thy wrongs remain'd. TELASCO. Such pow'r is more than human!â And wilt thou then employ such gifts for me? CORTEZ. I will, and shortly too. Let the proud tyrant, Who scorn'd thy claims, exultingly display His boasted forces, let him circle round His splendid throne with millions of his vassals, I'll lead thee, gallant friend, to fame and vengeance. TELASCO. Vengeance! The very sound of it transports me. Let me but fairly meet him face to face, And fate may do its worst.âBut tell me trulyâ I would be sureâfor deeply rankles here Remembrance of the wrongs which I sustain'd From that injurious despotâMy Zelama, Array'd in all her native loveliness, By day, by night, still haunts my lab'ring fancyâ I see her as she was, when first her heart Own'd me its lordâI hear her breathe fond vows Of everlasting tenderness and loveâ I see the pangs which rack'd her feeling bosom When her proud brother tore her from my armsâ There's madness in the thought!âCanst thou feel for me? Wil'st aid my just revenge? CORTEZ. Thou need'st not doubt me. I am a Spaniard. 'Tis my nation's boast, Honour and plighted faith to keep unstain'd. TELASCO. I would confide in thee.âThere's that about thee Which bears a shew of honestyâI know notâ CORTEZ. Dost doubt me then? 'Tis sign thou know'st me not. He, who suspects my honour, is unworthy Of sharing in my friendship.âFare thee wellâ I thought more nobly of thee. TELASCO. Nay, thou wrong'st me. CORTEZ. 'Tis thou wrong'st me. I doubted not thy faith, But with a soldier's frankness proffer'd thee My pow'rful aid to vindicate thy causeâ TELASCO. No more, no more! I will no longer doubt thee. Swear that thou wilt maintain my injur'd rights, That thou wilt never meet on peaceful terms Our common foe, 'till all Telasco's wrongs Shall be redress'dâswear this, and with my hand Accept my friendship and the aid I bring thee. CORTEZ. Hear, oh ye heav'nly pow'rs! Record my vow, While thus to Tlascala's brave prince I swear Eternal friendship; hear, while I proclaim Myself th' assertor of his love and glory! TELASCO. Now, Montezuma! shalt thou own thy wrongs, Now shall Telasco, like an angry spirit, Appal thy soul, and force thee to be just! Let us not lose a momentâVengeance, love, Call for immediate action. Lead thine host To join my hardy Tlascalans. See, where On yonder spreading heights they stand. Our clime Boasts not of hearts more valiant or resolv'd. Comeâto our guardian gods we'll altars raise, And in their presence ratify our vows. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Front of Teutile's Cottage. Enter Teutile and Gonsalvo. TEUTILE. Cheer up, young strangerâNourish not a grief So unavailing. Fate may yet relentâ GONSALVO. Alas! good father, what hath fate in store For such a wretch as I am? Flown for ever Are the gay prospects of my op'ning youth; Friends, country, all that give a zest to life For ever lost!âIn the cold earth is laid My brave, my luckless friend. His cares are overâ When mine will endâ TEUTILE. Take courage. Thou may'st yet See thy lov'd country, once again embrace Those whom thy sick'ning heart now yearns to meet. GONSALVO. Could I indeed review them! That were bliss I scarcely dare to hope for. Yet I know notâ There may be meansâ TEUTILE. Would'st thou rejoin thy comrades? GONSALVO. Could'st thou object t' it? TEUTILE. 'Tis an honest wish, Which nature prompts, and man should not oppose. But mark me, youthâShould'st thou with them combine To spread destruction 'mid our peaceful tribes, Oh! think what double guilt would load thy soul. Thou had'st no claim on me; the innocent blood Wherewith thy hands were stain'd bore witness 'gainst thee, And cried aloud for vengeance; yet I sav'd theeâ GONSALVO. May heav'n's dread bolt light on me, if I harm One of thy gen'rous people! While my soul Preserves the mem'ry of thy recent kindness, My voice shall plead for them, my arm shall guard them. TEUTILE. Go, good young man, I will not, cannot doubt thee. Thou hast a feeling heart; follow it's guidance When suff'ring fellow creatures claim thy pity, And heav'n will pay thee tenfold.âComeâprepareâ Take some provision for thy vent'rous course, And then may Providence direct thy way! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A wild mountainous Country. Enter Cortez and Velasquez. CORTEZ. This savage is a brave ally; he brings A force with him which we may well employ. I look'd not for such succour. VELASQUEZ. Never yet Saw I his equal. Bold he is and ardent, Untameable his passions, proud, resentful, But then withal so cred'lousâHad'st thou seen him E'en now, when through our armament I led him, How dumb with wonder he survey'd our weapons, Admir'd our armour, touch'd, examin'd allâ CORTEZ. No marvel things so new should thus amaze him. VELASQUEZ. But what most mov'd and pleas'd him were our horses. 'Twas mine own steed he saw, caparison'd, Champing his bit, and ready for my mounting. âWhat's this?â exclaim'd heââis't a man?âa god?â â'Tis,â I replied, âthe partner of my toils; âBorne on his back, no obstacles can check âMy rapid course; swift as the wind we fly, âSurmount the cliff, plunge through the raging floodââ No more he heard meâwith a vault he bounded Into the seatâ CORTEZ. 'Tis a courageous savage. Thy courser's mettled, over-match'd I fear For such unpractis'd guider. VELASQUEZ. Not a whit. With a loud shout he shot across the plain, Urging the vigour of th' affrighted steedâ Enter Telasco. TELASCO. Such wonders have I seen!âI've held a race With the fleet winds and beat them. Oft I've chas'd The nimble antelope and have outstript him, But ne'er 'till now saw I so brave a creature As that which bore me. He was all fire, all life, All energy! Methought one soul inspir'd us. Then such docilityâWhat country's thine Which boasts such prodigies? CORTEZ. I'll shew thee greater. TELASCO. Thou deal'st in miracles. Turn where I will, Some new enchantment meets my dazzled sight. Why ev'ry element is subject to thee; Thou dost command them all. Thy coats are proof 'Gainst our keen arrowsâSayâWhere grows the metal, Which thy superior pow'rs have master'd thus? CORTEZ. In Europe, whence we come. Thou shalt have store on't. TELASCO. Wilt give me store on't? Thou'rt a friend indeed! CORTEZ. Take from my hand this bright and trusty faulchionâ TELASCO. To me! In very truth dost give it me? Now, now indeed am I invincible. Methinks some spirit doth reside in it, That through my ev'ry nerve and vein diffuses New life and energy. My blood runs quicker, My heart more strongly beats, each faculty Seems as 'twere doubly brac'd for instant action. Now, now let Montezuma summon forth His countless thousandsâLet him dare me now! Thus arm'd, I'll meet himâmeet the proud oppressor, Shake his high throne, and from his vanquish'd hand Snatch my Zelama!âAnd thou giv'st it me? What would'st thou have? Can gold, can gems requite thee? Speak, gen'rous Spaniard, tell me what returnâ CORTEZ. If thou art gratified, return is made. My friendship is not bounded by such trifles. Thou shalt have more. I'll teach thee how to use Those wonder-working tubes, which vomit flames, And like the angry bolt of heav'n deal forth Assur'd destruction on the distant foe. TELASCO. Would'st make me equal to thyself? CORTEZ. In all, In all will we be brothers. Prove thyself True to our friendship, and partake with me In full community the pow'rs I hold. TELASCO. Give me thy handâ CORTEZ. 'Tis thineâNow on to Mexico! Soon shalt thou learn how far my pow'rs extend. Her prince shall bow to our confed'rate force; Glory shall wait on thee; Zelama's charms Shall be the noble guerdon of thy toils. TELASCO. 'Tis transportâecstacy! Let us set forthâ I'll follow thee, thou harbinger of good! Let thy loud trumps proclaim our instant march; Then onâto love, to glory, and Zelama! [Exeunt. SCENE III. Montezuma's Palace. Enter Montezuma, Guatimozin, and Caciques. MONTEZUMA. At this eventful moment, which seems pregnant With Mexico's and Montezuma's fate, I have assembled you, caciques! to scan, If yet we may, the means of present safety. Perils as yet unheard of menace us. Were our foes ordinary men, we need not Fear their attack; sufficient is our force To meet their utmost efforts. But with such We cope not now. GUATIMOZIN. If signal be our peril, Let our defence be correspondent to it. When common dangers threaten, common courage May arm us 'gainst them: ordinary men Grow heroes when their risk is ascertain'd: New perils are the touchstone of our virtue, And prove the sterling value of our spirits. I speak the thought of all your brave caciques. True to their king, their country, and themselves, To guard thy throne, to face these pow'rful strangers, Behold them ready to devote themselves, And rush to action when their monarch bids them. MONTEZUMA. Such sentiments become you. Take my thanks. Could princely valour save our menac'd state, Well might I trust your patriotic zeal; But dreadful are the times in which we live, And destiny itself seems arm'd against us. (To Guatimozin) Give me thine earâThou cans't not have forgotten The prophecy recorded in our archivesâ GUATIMOZIN. Some legend, bred by ignorance, and foster'd By superstitious fearâ MONTEZUMA. Term it not so. 'Tis most authentic, and receiv'd for ages As a mysterious warning of the fate Which would befal our empire. GUATIMOZIN. I'm no friend To oracles and mystic revelations, Couch'd under doubtful words to raise alarm, And dupe the cred'lous.âBut, I pray, proceed. MONTEZUMA. Thus runs the mystic warning of our fateâ That at th' appointed periodâand what time More likely than the present?âshould arrive, From regions far beyond the eastern main, A hardy band, the sons of those who erst The proud foundations of our empire laid, From us to claim their rightful heritage. GUATIMOZIN. And these are they? MONTEZUMA. Too surely such they seem. GUATIMOZIN. If such be fate's decree, our duty is To meet it as we ought. If we must fall, Oh! let us fall like men; let us dispute Our territory inch by inch. By heav'n! When in his country's cause a soldier falls, The little spot which his cold body covers Is richer than an empire! MONTEZUMA. There are times When cooler councils should predominate; And such is this.âNay, be not thus incred'lousâ There are alarming portents, prodigies, Strange voices, hosts embattled in the skyâ Enter Orozimbo. OROZIMBO. Commission'd by our holy priests I come, To give thee notice that the sacrifice In honour of our gods hath been fulfill'd. Thy presence is requir'd. MONTEZUMA. Prov'd all propitious? OROZIMBO. I dar'd not glance within the sacred veil Which shrouds from eyes impure their solemn rite, But a low murmur ran of angry gods, And pale and ghastly were the looks of those Who slowly issuing forth gave me their orders. MONTEZUMA. I told thee soâI knew our gods were adverse, Go not awayâremainâI fly to learn What hath betided, what may next ensue. [Exit with Caciques. Manent Guatimozin and Orozimbo. GUATIMOZIN. Alas! that superstition thus should quench Those energies, which can alone redeem us! Is he a man? Hath he a soul or sense? Is this a time to deal with oracles, To truckle to his priests? OROZIMBO. I greatly fear He hath more solid grounds for apprehension. From the remoter border of the lake A messenger is come, who tells th' approach Of our redoubted foes. GUATIMOZIN. Why let them come! Why should we fear them? OROZIMBO. Vict'ry mark'd their course, Successive provinces confess'd their sway; Nay, what transcends belief, amid their ranks In proud defiance wave Telasco's banners. GUATIMOZIN. Telasco join with them! He, he desert us! Then from the earth are faith and honour flown. Art certain he hath join'd them? OROZIMBO. He who told it Is most authentic. But behold the princess. She looks alarm'd. Pray heav'n she heard it not. Enter Zelama. ZELAMA. What new calamities hath fate in store? Whence all these horrors, which like black'ning clouds Collect around us? Tell me, Guatimozin, Nor fear to speakâI am prepar'd for all. As here I pass'd, I met my royal brother. On his dark brow dread and suspicion sat: When I address'd him, with an air disturb'd He put me from him, and abruptly left me. GUATIMOZIN. I cannot tell thee. There are strange reportsâ He hath enough to move him, real dangers Enough to shake a stronger mind than his: But superstition in his soul hath lodg'd Her deadly poison; deeply there it rankles, Unmans him, and defeats our last sad hope. ZELAMA. Alas! too well I know his mind is prone To credit myst'ries, which his cooler judgment Had taught him to despise. Have then the priests Thus wrought upon him? GUATIMOZIN. Yesâobscure traditions, The frantic ravings of a zealot's brain, Distort his sense, and magnify the perils Which manly valour would disdain to fear. Enter Montezuma, hastily. MONTEZUMA. Save me, protect me, heav'n! Where can I shroud In tenfold shades the horrors which assail me? Oh had some rock torn from its base o'erwhelm'd me, Had the earth open'd and inclos'd me living, It had been mercy! ZELAMA. What alarms thee thus? Why tremble thus thy limbs?âSpeak, I conjure thee. MONTEZUMA. Oh my Zelama! ruin stalks around usâ Our doom is spokenâI have heard such thingsâ ZELAMA. In mercy speakâ MONTEZUMA. Thou canst not bear to hear it. ZELAMA. Try me. My soul is firm. MONTEZUMA. Prepare thee then To hear the tidings of our sure destruction. Scarce had I reach'd the sacred spot, where stood Our holy priests watching the altar's flame, Scarce had I glanc'd upon the bleeding victims Scatter'd around its base, when suddenly The temple shook, as if convulsing nature Rock'd the firm earth; the torches ceas'd to blaze, Loud thunders burst, blue lightnings flash'd around, And streams of fire seem'd pouring from the roof. Suddenâit harrows up my heart to think on'tâ A voice was heardâIt was no human soundâ 'Twas the great spirit's selfââMonarch,â it cried, âHear fate's decree. The vengeful hour approaches âFrom eastern climes arrives the destin'd raceâ âThey come to claim their rightful heritageâ âThy Mexico must fallââ GUATIMOZIN. Be calm, my liege! Brave are your troops and loyal. Summon all To arm against these foes, whom thirst of goldâ MONTEZUMA. Gold, say'st thou: Let them have their fill of itâ What is our gold to us? Dross, baubles, nothing! Let them have more than e'er their av'rice dreamt ofâ GUATIMOZIN. Oh! stoop not thus to bribe them to forbearance. We've strength, we've arms, and courage to employ them. Let them be put to th' proofâ MONTEZUMA. The stake's too highâ Here, Orozimboâhaste thee to their campâ Take with thee goldâgive it them on condition That they retireâBut holdâthou wilt be niggard, When we require profusionâFollow me. [Exeunt Montezuma and Orozimbo. Manent Zelama and Guatimozin. ZELAMA. Ah! lost indeed is Mexico, when thus Her pilot quits the helm, and leaves her driving At mercy of the waves. Alas, my brother! Not thus our ancestors achiev'd their gloryâ GUATIMOZIN. They listen'd not like him to vain reports, They bow'd not to the superstitious sway Of their designing priests.âWhat should appal us? ZELAMA. Trueâall we want is constancy to face A danger, which our constancy may vanquish. Methinks, their numbers ought not thus to daunt us. For ev'ry man they have we have a thousand. GUATIMOZIN. We lack not men. Had we but one to guide them, Glorious success might wait on our exertions. ZELAMA. But one to guide them?âHave you not Telasco? Have you not him, and talk of wanting leaders! His spirit would suffice to stem the march Of our invaders, were their numbers doubled, And, doubled, ten times told.âOh brave Telasco! If Mexico's tame sons should hide their heads, And shrink from peril when he call'd them on, Her daughters would forsake their looms, would snatch From their base hands their unavailing weapons, And rush with him to share the splendid danger! GUATIMOZIN. Would he were here! ZELAMA. Is now that wish but form'd? Knows not the brave Telasco of the perils Which threaten us so nearly? GUATIMOZIN. Ayeâhe knows them. ZELAMA. Then Mexico may yet be safe!âWhen comes he? GUATIMOZIN. Rumour, which still delights in new alarms, Which, though it sometimes may exceed the truth, Doth sometimes tell it, hath brought heavy tidingsâ ZELAMA. Of what? GUATIMOZIN. That many vassals and allies Have leagued against us. ZELAMA. What's that to Telasco? GUATIMOZIN. Nay worseâthe Tlascalansâ ZELAMA. They turn against us? Could not Telasco keep them to their duty? GUATIMOZIN. What if he would not? ZELAMA. Ha! what is't thou say'st? Why look'st thou thus? GUATIMOZIN. How can I speak it to thee? Telascoâmust I tell it thee?âis falseâ ZELAMA. False is the tongue which slanders thus his fame! He false! He rebel! He support our foes! Oh wrong'd Telasco!âWhat! The patriot hero, Who with his blood his loyalty has seal'd! 'Tis false! He lives to succour and protect us. GUATIMOZIN. In yonder hostile camp his banners wave. I would have spar'd you this. You wrung it from meâ Now can I but confirm it. Heav'n support thee! [Exit Guatimozin. ZELAMA. True, said he?âWhat! confirm it?âGracious heav'n! If he be false, o'ertake him in his course, And pour upon his guilty head your vengeance! It cannot beâsome ven'mous tongue hath wrong'd himâ Or if, by momentary passion warp'd, He may have err'd, my warning voice may save him. I'll seek him even in the Spanish campâ Yet holdâAlone, defenceless and a woman, Dare I encounter perils, which to think on Curdles my blood? But have I not a cause, To arm my soul with more than manly spirit? Hence then, vain terrors! Coward caution hence! Love, honour, Mexico, shall drown your voice. I come, Telasco! To thy soul I'll speak. My bosom glows; inspiring hope impels me To save my country and my hero's fame! [Exit. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A Hall in Montezuma's Palace. Enter Guatimozin and Orozimbo. GUATIMOZIN. Gone forth to meet the foe? Hath Montezuma Submitted to become a suppliant? I thought thou had'st commission to repair With splendid presents to the Spanish camp. OROZIMBO. I was prepar'd to go, when to his presence I suddenly was call'd. I found the king Surrounded by his priests. He listen'd eagerly To their discourse of dreams and revelations, Which seem'd to move him strangely. GUATIMOZIN. Yesâto them He listens readily, when they rehearse Their visionary fablesâBut proceed. OROZIMBO. I told him that the treasures were prepar'd. With that, attended by his priestly train Who bore his off'rings, from the gate he issuedâ GUATIMOZIN. Hear'st thou? What means that clamour? OROZIMBO. 'Tis the king. GUATIMOZIN. Comes he as king, or as a captive led By his insulting foes? OROZIMBO. As forth he went In regal dignity, so comes he back. Enter Montezuma, Priests and Attendants. MONTEZUMA. Prepare for the reception of this envoy From Europe's prince! Ye sacred ministers, Hence to the temple; pay to the ruling spirit Your tributary sacrifice of thanks. I will forthwith attend you.âGuatimozin! Rejoice with me: our cause of dread is past. GUATIMOZIN. I would indeed rejoice if it were past. MONTEZUMA. Trust me we did injustice to these strangers: They are not foes; from Europe's prince they come, With us to form alliance. GUATIMOZIN. Come allies As these invaders come! MONTEZUMA. Thou dost mistake them. Had'st heard their leader state the friendly views And peaceable intentions of his king, Thou had'st believ'd him. GUATIMOZIN. I'd believe as soon The hooded serpent would not wound my hand, Were I to stretch it tow'rds him! that the tiger, When crouching for his prey and hot for blood, Would spare his trembling victim! MONTEZUMA. Thou shalt see, And shortly too, how futile are thy doubts. The noble Cortez will ere long arrive, Confiding in our honour and good faith, Within these walls to ratify our treaty. GUATIMOZIN. Within these walls? Shall we thus court destruction? Think on't againâBare if thou will'st thy breast To the tornadoâseek pale pestilence When in the air she hoversâbut beware How thou trust'st him! MONTEZUMA. Why not? There are occasions, When manly confidence is our best wisdom; And such I deem the present. Come with meâ Join in our sacrifice; then talk with Cortez, Hear him detail his friendly purposes, And thou'lt confess that Mexico is safe. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Outskirt of Cortez's Camp. Enter Gonsalvo. GONSALVO. Yonder's our campânow am I safe again. Propitious heav'n, which through surrounding perils Hast guarded and supported me, receive The tribute of my thanks!âBut softâwho comes?â A woman? And alone?âHer garb bespeaks her Of no mean qualityâshe seems disturb'd. [He stands aside. Enter Zelama, veiled. ZELAMA. Oh why, when urg'd by duty and by love Thus far have I advanc'd, does my heart shrink, And all my boasted resolution vanish? I deem'd myself more able to support The hazards of my enterprizeâDefend me, Ye heav'nly pow'rs! Who thus approaches me? GONSALVO. Maiden, why thus alone so near our camp Hast thou adventur'd? Be not thus alarm'd. Thou may'st confide in me. I will not harm thee. ZELAMA. Thou look'st as ifâand yet thy words are friendlyâ Art thou not one of those, who arm'd with terrors Have landed 'mong usâ GONSALVO. Lady, I am one, Who, though to arms inur'd, have learn'd to rev'rence Thy sex's claim; whose heart can feel it's pow'r, And whose best zeal will guard it. ZELAMA. Courteous stranger, I am not prone to doubt, and thy fair words Might well disarm suspicion; yet report Hath told such thingsâThou surely art of those, Whose bold aggression hath provok'd our fears. GONSALVO. Though here with those invaders I arriv'd, My nature is not savage. Had it been so, I had not merited the name of man, If to the kindness of thy countrymen I prov'd insensible. I was at his mercy, And must have perish'd, had not the kind hand Of a good Indian sav'd me from destruction. Can I reflect on that, and injure thee? ZELAMA. I will confide in thee. I need protection, And claim it from thee. GONSALVO. Freely speak thy pleasure, And tax my utmost service. Let us hence, Nor linger here. This precinct of a camp Is not a place where thou may'st fitly stay. ZELAMA. I thank thee. Know'st thou where in yonder lines Telasco's banners wave?âConduct me to him. Ask in return what recompense thou wil'st. GONSALVO. Far from my soul be such ignoble thought! No, lady, noâthe Indian who reliev'd me Ask'd no return; his bounty, like the dew Of gracious heav'n, spontaneously descended, And rous'd my dormant virtue into action. There lies our way. Be of good courage, lady; Whate'er betide, I'll guard thee with my life. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Cortez's Camp. Enter Cortez and Velasquez, with Soldiers. CORTEZ. Is all prepar'd? Have you throughout our line Issued mine orders? VELASQUEZ. Ev'ry thing is ready. CORTEZ. Let us 'bove all maintain strict discipline, And gain firm footing in yon Mexico. We shall have time enough to drop the mask, When we're once 'stablish'd in their confidence. Be this attended to. (He stands musing. VELASQUEZ. 'Tis well advis'd. When once we're safely lodg'd, let 'em look to it. The courtly train that waited on their king Gave us a tempting sample of the wealth We may expect to find within the town. 'Twill be a booty to enrich us all. CORTEZ. And hark, Velasquez! Search Telasco out. That hair-brain'd savage may defeat our plans Should we neglect to watch him. Had the king Met us in arms, he might have serv'd us well: As 'tis, observe him closely; take good heed He go not with us to the town.âHow now! What brings him here o' th' sudden? Enter Telasco. TELASCO. (To the soldiers) âStand asideâ (To Cortez) â'Tis well I've found theeâTell me, thou deceiver, Hath Montezuma visited the camp, While I was unappriz'd, as if I were An abject thing, unworthy of regard? Thou knew'st I would have met him face to faceâ CORTEZ. Be patient, valiant prince! The time will comeâ TELASCO. I tell thee that the time is comeâis pastâ Shame on thy promises! Is this thy faith? Did'st thou not swear thou would'st espouse my cause, That thou would'st ne'er with Montezuma treat, 'Till all my wrongs should be redress'd? CORTEZ. I did.â Charge me with perfidy and breach of faith! But I forgive thee. I was not inform'd Of his intended visit, and so brief Our conf'rence prov'd, had I implor'd thy presence, His quick return had frustrated thy meeting. But shortly shalt thou fit occasion find Effectually to urge thy rightful claims. TELASCO. When wil't arrive? CORTEZ. This day. TELASCO. Comes he so shortly? CORTEZ. He comes not hitherâwe repair to him. He hath with lib'ral confidence invited Me and my friends to visit Mexico. TELASCO. That's wellâexceeding wellâIn Mexico? Within his walls?âI thank thee for the tidings. How could I doubt thee, how suspect thy faith? I do repent meâIf my hasty nature Hath wrought perversely in me, pass it over.â In Mexico!âThen shall I view Zelama, Bask in her heav'nly smilesâOh gen'rous Spaniard! If in thy native clime thou'st own'd the pow'r Of all-subduing loveâ CORTEZ. I have not been Insensible to beautyâI have lov'dâ TELASCO. I knew itâthou'rt too noble and too brave Not to have bow'd to his resistless sway. But when thou seest the virgin whom I love, When thou shalt hear her eloquently speak, Shalt see her eyes beaming with tendernessâ CORTEZ. I shall impatiently expect to meet her. Announce me as thy friend; bid her receive me As one who loves thee. TELASCO. She will love thee thenâ But let's awayâmy soul is on the wingâ Each moment lost is treason to my love. CORTEZ. Forward thenâon to Mexico, to glory, To the completion of thy fondest hopes. Array thy forceâhold them prepar'd to march When the loud clarion breathes its warning note. 'Till then in yonder vale let them remain. FarewellâI hasten to draw forth my line, And thenâ TELASCO. And then for vengeance and Zelama! I pray thee hasteâissue thine orders quicklyâ Let but thy clarion give its welcome call, And swifter than heav'n's bolt we follow thee! [Exit Telasco. CORTEZ. Soâwe're well rid of himâlet him but wait Where I have plac'd him 'till my clarion sounds, And he's secure enoughâwe need not watch him. Ere this impetuous savage shall have rang'd His rude battalions, on yon lofty walls In proud defiance shall my banners wave. Then let him dare me if he will!âVelasquez! Give orders for our instant marchâaway! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Interior of Telasco's Tent. Enter Telasco and Capana. TELASCO. How wears the time? CAPANA. Two hours are nearly pass'd, Since the bright sun his high meridian left. TELASCO. The day grows old, and we are still inactive. What can those Spaniards find to keep them thus? Would Cortez had the spur in him which I have! He would not lingerâGoâenquire the causeâ Bring me prompt answer. [Exit Capana. By my faith, this Spaniard Is of a gallant nature, frank and noble. I was to blame in doubting his good faith: I do repent me of it. With what kindness Did he pass over my impatient chidings, And give me in return the blissful hope Which now expands my heartâ Enter Capana. CAPANA. A Spanish warrior, With a veil'd damsel, earnestly implores Immediate audience. TELASCO. Think'st thou I can waste My time on suitors now? Say I'm employ'd. CAPANA. I told them so. The warrior acquiesc'd, But with augmented earnestness the damsel Implor'd to see thee. Sighing she exclaim'd, âHe must receive meâurgent is my missionâ âHis fame, his hopes, his love depend on it!â TELASCO. Admit her straightâ Exit Capana. My fame, my hopes, my love! What can this myst'ry mean? Enter Capana with Zelama veiled. TELASCO. Leave us aloneâ Exit Capana. Who art thou, damsel? Wherefore seek'st thou thus In phrase obscure and dark immediate audience? If of my love thou know'st, impart it quickly. ZELAMA. Of what, alas! was once thy loveâ TELASCO. What was? ZELAMA. What wasâbut which no longer nowâ TELASCO. What mean'st thou? Keep me not in suspenseâspeakâ ZELAMA. Ask thine heart, Consult that faithful monitor. 'Twill tell thee If thou art constant to thy plighted faith, If yet Zelamaâ TELASCO. If my heart yet love her! There's not a drop, which from that fountain flows Untinctur'd by my love! There's not a pulse Beats through my frame, which owes not strength to her! Witness, ye heav'ns, and ye presiding spiritsâ ZELAMA. Invoke not heav'n to hear thy perjur'd vowsâ TELASCO. Forbearâprovoke me notâmy nature's hasty When 'tis thus touch'd. I do respect thy sexâ ZELAMA. I ask no shield to ward me from thy vengeance; Let it light on me, for my words shall wake it. Know, faithless man! it is Zelama speaks them. (She unveils. TELASCO. Zelama! Gracious pow'rs! ZELAMA. Yes! 'Tis Zelama, Thy once believing, credulous Zelama! She, at whose feet thou'st knelt, and pour'd forth vows Of endless constancy; she, who now finds thee Bankrupt in faith, in honour and allegiance. TELASCO. What say'st thou?âI forgetful of my faith! Not purer is the flame, which from yon sun Pervades this globe, than that which warms my heart. Can'st thou accuse me thus? There was a timeâ ZELAMA. There was a timeâalas! can I recal it?â When I esteem'd thee Mexico's best hope, Our country's guardian, ornament and pride. I priz'd thee then, look'd up to thee for all Which love could promise, honour could fulfil. What art thou now?âLook from thy tent, and tell me! TELASCO. I have not merited this foul reproach. If ever I deserv'd my country's favour, If with thy love I e'er was bless'd, believe me, I'm still unchang'd, still true to thee as ever. What though I hither come array'd in arms, Though 'mid the ensigns of these warlike strangers My banners wave, still is my faith untainted; 'Tis for thy sake I join'd themâ ZELAMA. Mine!âOh wretched, Oh lost Zelama!âAm I the pretext, The flimsy veil to screen a rebel's guilt? Where, where are flown those inborn sentiments Of gen'rous loyalty, that patriot zeal, Which grac'd thee once, for which alone I lov'd thee? Ah! where is now that hero, that Telasco, To whom our Mexico look'd up for safety? Behold him! See the rebel to his king Crouch to th' invading Spaniard; mark his banners Wave in derision o'er his bleeding country! TELASCO. Thy words are daggers to my heart. Thou wrong'st me. Wast thou not torn from me? Did not thy brother Spurn my alliance? Hope abandon'd me; Despair and vengeance occupied my soul: This Spaniard promis'd to assist my love, And force reluctant justice from the tyrant Who kept thee from me. If I gave him credence, If I too rashly yielded to temptationâ ZELAMA. Hath treason then assum'd a novel aspect, Are honour, faith, allegiance, grown mere words, Which thou may'st sport with as best suits thy purpose? 'Tis to thy heart I speak. I know thy nature; 'Tis noble, princely and ingenuous. Thou should'st have known me too; known that my heart, Which felt, which lov'd thy virtues, had the force To cast thee from me, should'st thou prove unworthy. TELASCO. Upbraid me still, but look not on me thusâ Weep'st thou?âI cannot bear thy tearsâOh turn! Reject me notâGrant me a moment's thoughtâ ZELAMA. Hear me, Telasco!âThou hast known my heart, How I esteem'd theeâlov'd theeâNay, forbearâ That heart is yet unchang'd; yet would I rather Plant there my dagger, with my vital blood Wash out thine image, than accept a hand Arm'd 'gainst it's sov'reign and insulted country. TELASCO. I see, I see th' extent of my offence! Conviction rushes on my soulâI stood On the dread verge of a steep precipice, And my next step had led me to destruction. Thy hand arrested me. Forget my faultâ Cast me not from theeâI may yet redeem My error, still prove worthy of thy favour. Thus at thy feet I register my vows, On this dear hand breathe forth my raptur'd soul, And pledge myself to act as thou would'st have me! ZELAMA. There spoke Telasco! Now again I know thee, Now can I look on thee with pride, and hail thee Our country's hero.âComeâthe time demands Immediate action; dangers lour around; To Mexico already Cortez marches. Know'st thou his plans? TELASCO. I had no cause to doubt him. His shew was honest. When he spoke with me, He talk'd of peace and treating with the king. ZELAMA. I fear his purposes. TELASCO. He shall be watch'd, And closely too.âBut we too long delay: My forces are array'd; let me conduct thee To where they stand expectant of my coming. Thy presence will inspire them with fresh ardour, And make them doubly brave. Then to thy brother! Thou hast redeem'd me, and shalt plead my cause. ZELAMA. I'll do such justice to thy princely worth, That he shall take thee to his inmost heart, And with his sanction ratify thy hopes. TELASCO. Oh grant me but occasion to deserve it! Place me 'mid perils great as my past errors, Let death array'd in all his terrors face me, I'll dare the glorious conflict, and, while arm'd With thy approval, meet impending fate! [Exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A public Place in Mexico. Enter a number of Indians shoutingâto them Orozimbo. OROZIMBO. Away! What mean ye thus to raise a clamour, And rush together in tumultuous crowds? Have ye not heard the proclamation, That no one shall presume to bar the way, But leave free passage for the princely train Attendant on the emp'ror, when he marches To meet the Spanish chief on his arrival? (Military music at a distance which gradually becomes louder.) Hark!âthey are at hand alreadyâclear the wayâ (Loud military music. Enter Cortez, Velasquez, and Salceda, with the Spanish army, cannon, &amp;c. &amp;c. CORTEZ. Throughout the line give forth command to halt. (The word is given. OROZIMBO. Illustrious leader of this pow'rful host, Who, from the chambers of the glowing east, Hast o'er the ocean held thy daring course, With Montezuma, our imperial lord, To form alliance and immortal friendship, I hail thy presence at his royal seat. Here for a few brief moments stay thy march, And his approach await.âLo! he arrives. (Wild martial music. Enter Montezuma, on a magnificent litter carried by twelve Caciques; Guatimozin, Priests, Warriors, &amp;c. The Spaniards salute him as he descendsâhis attendants draw up opposite to them.âCortez advances towards Montezuma. MONTEZUMA. Welcome, thrice welcome art thou, noble stranger! Accept this pledge (presents his hand), as symbol of my friendship. CORTEZ. I take it thankfully, most royal sir, And in return presume to tender mine, As surety of my faith and humble duty. I am a plain, blunt soldier, little us'd To courts and all their tinsel braveries: Take me for what I am, for one whose tongue Ne'er was at variance with his heart, who feels With gratitude thy lib'ral confidence, And will with equal confidence repay it. MONTEZUMA. I doubt thee notâI have already proof on't. While here thy sojourn lasts, we shall have leisure To arrange our treaty, and confirm alliance With the great monarch of the eastern world, From whom thou bear'st commission. Know, meanwhile, A spacious palace, in old time th' abode Of my progenitors, is set apart For the reception of thy warlike followers. Within its ample bounds, embattled still, Securely may they rest. All is provided For their fair entertainment. For thyself, My dwelling, like my heart, is open to thee. Thither, I pray thee, let me straight conduct thee. CORTEZ. Feeling thy gracious kindness as becomes me, I must perforce decline the high distinction Thy favour would bestow. I must maintain Strict discipline, lest, as my troops are strangers, And uninform'd of your peculiar customs, As are your Mexicans of our's, some chance Unlook'd-for might occur, which may disturb The harmony which ought to reign between them. For this day, royal sir, grant me thy licence To sojourn with my people, who are us'd To my controul, and will obey my orders. To-morrow will I visit thee betimesâ MONTEZUMA. Do what beseems thee best, and rest assur'd Our royal care shall watch for thy protection. Here, Orozimboâto thy charge I give The noble Cortez and his gallant train; Conduct them to their residence, and see That nought be wanting for their fair reception. Farewellâto-morrow I expect to see thee. CORTEZ. 'Till then I humbly take my leave.âVelasquez Give word to march, and, as our forces pass The royal station, be such honour paid As the imperial dignity requires. [Cortez and his troops march off with martial music, saluting Montezuma as they pass, who then retires as he came on.] SCENE II. An Apartment in Montezuma's Palace. Enter Zelama and Telasco. ZELAMA. Come, my lov'd friend, for so I now can term thee, Beneath this roof, which witness'd our first vows, I greet thee once again our country's champion. Haste hither, Montezuma! to thy bosom Take my Telasco, hail him as thy brother. TELASCO. His brother! Sure there's magic in the sound. Am I so blest? Speak it againâconfirm itâ Tell me that all the visions of delight Which rush upon my aching soul are true, That I indeed behold thee, that this hand, This tender yielding hand, at last is mine. Oh! speakâcompose my agitated senses, Or, if too strong the mighty flood of joy For my swoln heart to bear, let me expire With such a foretaste of eternal bliss! ZELAMA. Oh rather live to justify my choice, To win renown, and save thy menac'd country!â Seeâthe proud moment of my triumph's come, For lo! my brotherâ Enter Montezuma. Welcome, trebly welcome! Now can I hail thee king indeed! Behold Our pledge of safety, Mexico's best hope, Telasco! MONTEZUMA. How! I look'd not here to meet him, Leagued as he was against me. ZELAMA. (To Telasco) âI implore thee, Restrain thyself awhile.âTrue, my best brother; He was misled: for is he not a man, With human frailties and with human passions? Thou know'st the griefs, I term them not the wrongs, Which drove him from thee: in his feeling soul Deeply they rankled; his rejected love, His blighted hopes fermented in his mind, And vengeance fir'd his bosom, when this Spaniard Lur'd him with gay delusive promisesâ MONTEZUMA. Who was't that lur'd him back? ZELAMA. I, I, my brother! Mine was the glorious task, and mine the triumph. I knew his worth, knew that his noble soul Was still untainted: 'mid the hostile camp I sought him, prov'd him, and have found him true. TELASCO. Like a bright seraph from high heav'n descending With my redemption's tidings charg'd she came, Restor'd me to myself, sav'd me from ruin, And broke the compact which despair had form'd. Oh she is all, that in her kindest mood Nature e'er fram'd, or fancy can pourtray! Sense, judgment, fortitude, angelic softness, Whate'er proud man of excellence can boast, Or fascinating woman most can grace, Combine in her. She, she was my preserver, She sav'd my honour, brought me back to theeâ MONTEZUMA. Come to my heart! Henceforth may ev'ry thought Hostile to friendship be for ever banish'd! (To Zelama) âTell me how best I can return the gift Which thou hast brought me. Do I rightly read That eye, which mutely eloquent speaks more Than words can utter? Is not this fair hand Our surest pledge and bond of amity? That smile confirms it.âTake it, brave Telasco, Take it, my more than valued friend, my brother! TELASCO. 'Tis mine! 'tis mine! Now fortune do thy worstâ I am beyond thy pow'r. (To Montezuma) By this dear hand, I am thine own. Command me; tax my service To all that man can do, or nature dare. I'd bare my bosom to heav'n's angry bolt, To ward it off from thee! MONTEZUMA. Thanks, my good brother! But proofs like this the time requires not now. The cloud which gather'd o'er us is dispers'd. With friendly purposes these Spaniards come. TELASCO. I joy to hear it: but observe them still, For they're possess'd of such gigantic means Of working harm, arms of such fatal pow'r, Such potent empire o'er the elements Of air and fire, that, should their projects prove Hostile to Mexico, our utmost force Might fail to oppose them. MONTEZUMA. Are they then so dreadful, So irresistible? TELASCO. Thou'st known me longâ I need not tell thee I've been us'd to war, How often in the bloody field I've fac'd The primest force our Indian clime can boast; But ne'er 'till now did I behold such warriors: They seem above mortality; each man Bears a charm'd lifeâ MONTEZUMA. Whate'er may be their pow'rs, They touch not us. I have their leader's faith, His solemn oath; I hold him as my hostage For its observance; he hath giv'n himself As pledge and warrantry of future peace. TELASCO. I trust he's honest. When I spoke with him, His words were friendly; and, though he express'd A fearless confidence in his own strength, He seem'd dispos'd to shun hostility. MONTEZUMA. So spoke he to myself. TELASCO. And yet I know notâ Perhaps I wrong him; but fair words may cloak A treach'rous purpose. 'Tis for his advantage, If he mean ill, to blind us. ZELAMA. Can ye doubt it? Can ye give credit to a specious fiction, Which the whole tenor of their course disproves? Look round, and trace their devastating progress. They have invaded usâthe calm abodes Of our poor countrymen they have destroy'dâ Pillage and booty are their open objectâ They preach the doctrine of revoltâtheir hands Are reeking with the blood of innocentsâ MONTEZUMA. 'Tis trueâso have we found themâ ZELAMA. Will ye then Repose in false security, while thus Treason and all her direst train of ills Are secretly at work, to raise a storm Which may o'erwhelm you? MONTEZUMA. What would'st have me do? My oath is plighted for these Spaniards' safety. TELASCO. Maintain it firmly, but in time prepare Means of prevention, should suspicion end In dreadful certainty. That task be mine. I will go forth, and make such fit arrangements As caution prompts. MONTEZUMA. Delay not, I beseech thee. I trust myself, my Mexico to thee. TELASCO. EnoughâI go. When danger is foreseen, 'Tis half averted.âFarewell, my Zelama! Wish me success, and 'tis already mine. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Cortez's Palace in Mexico. Enter Cortez, Velasquez, and Officers. CORTEZ. Welcome to Mexico, my gallant friends! Had we on yester morn but dar'd to hope That here our Spanish standard should be rear'd, Who had not mock'd us? VELASQUEZ. Trueâbeyond the scope Of expectation hath our fortune prov'd. But still my mind misgives me.âWe're alone; Telasco's force remains without the walls; These Mexicansâ CORTEZ. Dismiss such idle fears! Trust to our fortune. VELASQUEZ. Fortune! She's a female, And therefore prone to change. She now may smile, But who can tell what she may prove to-morrow? What if she should become our foe? CORTEZ. Why then We'll conquer her.âBut wherefore trifle we? Each to his postâbe watchful.â[Exeunt officers.]âHist Velasquez! Remain.âWhen I reflect, my good Velasquez, On what thou said'st, I must perforce confess Our state is critical and hazardous. VELASQUEZ. Were I sole guider of our enterprize I would insure success. We have the means, If we but dare to use them: but the moments, Which we can call our own, are few and brief. At present, these dull Mexicans believe us Invincible, all-pow'rful and immortal; But rumour speedily will disabuse them, When they shall hear of poor Gonsalvo's fate, Who, with brave Alvarado and his party, Was slain as o'er the mountains we advanc'd. CORTEZ. There's much in what thou say'st. I will think on't, And tell thee moreâ(starts)âMay I believe mine eyes? Lookâ'tis himselfâit is, it is Gonsalvo! Enter Gonsalvo. GONSALVO. Again with joy my gen'ral I salute. CORTEZ. Thou'rt welcomeâI ne'er thought to see thee more. How did'st thou 'scape the bloody crew who chas'd thee? GONSALVO. With Alvarado singly I took refuge In a thick wood, where an old Indian met us, And gave us shelter in his humble cottage. Had we been friends, had not our hands been crimson'd With the fresh blood of his own countrymen, He could not with more kindness have reliev'd us. VELASQUEZ. When last I saw thee, such were not the terms Wherein thou spok'st of Indians. GONSALVO. TrueâI knew not The mild humanity that grac'd their nature. Hads't thou experienc'd half the tenderness, Which this poor savage shew'd me in distress, Thy soul had felt it. VELASQUEZ. Thank my better stars! Such feelings touch not me. I came not hither To whine and whimper like a puling girl, But to repair injurious fortune's wrongs, And in these golden climes to reap my harvest. CORTEZ. What 'came of Alvarado? GONSALVO. Fruitless prov'd Our utmost care. His pilgrimage is o'er. CORTEZ. Peace to his shade! He was a gallant soldier. How cam'st thou here? GONSALVO. With the cacique Telasco. CORTEZ. Is he in Mexico? GONSALVO. Had'st thou not notice Of his intent?âHe seems a pow'rful chief, Of gallant bearing, and expert in arms. I took th' occasion of his coming hither To enter with his train. He's well attended, For with him came the sister of the kingâ CORTEZ. Where did they bend their course? GONSALVO. Straight to the palace. Their presence seem'd to give a general joyâ CORTEZ. No doubt on'tâ'tis too plainâall were confed'rate To take us blindfoldâ VELASQUEZ. What's our fortune now? I gave thee warningâI was sure some devil Would cross our path. How could she get to him? CORTEZ. No matter how. Sure nought could have occurr'd More fatal to our planâHow nowâSalceda! Enter Salceda. Thy looks are ominousâ SALCEDA. They suit my tidings. Telasco marches through the crowded streets, Calling on all the citizens to armâ CORTEZ. Look to our postsâSee that the guards be doubledâ Point our artillery, so that each discharge May mow down hundredsâlet the gunners stand With lighted linstocks, ready for the word! Velasquez! order thy detachment out, And follow me. Now is the crisis come; Our fortunes all are set upon one cast, And death or vict'ry the great stake we play for! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Montezuma's Palace. Enter Montezuma. MONTEZUMA. Thank heav'n! the horrors of suspence are over, And peace, too long a stranger to my bosom, Again revisits my distemper'd heart. Like mine own subject lake, when hush'd the billows That ruffled its smooth surface, my vex'd mind Resumes its customary calm. The Spaniard Commits himself to me, a willing hostage, Bound by strong oaths of lasting amity. Telasco tooâHe is himself a host, Unmatch'd in arms, the idol of the people. While I have himâand he is now mine ownâ I fear no foes; I am invincible, And laugh at the vain legends of my priests, Who in the hour of peril, when strange fears Disturb'd my wayward fancy, wrought upon me, And with their wild chimeras rack'd my brain. Enter Orozimbo. Wellâwhat report'st thou of our new allies? OROZIMBO. When I had executed my commission, I left them to reposee. They seem'd well pleas'd With what thy princely bounty had provided, And, as I came away, their leader, Cortez, Charg'd me to bear to thee his grateful thanks, And humble hope that thou would'st still continue To him and his thy favour and protection. MONTEZUMA. He may rely upon't.âThou may'st retire. [Exit Orozimbo. This gallant Spaniard merits all my care: He shall have ample proofs of my esteem Ere he depart, more than his hopes e'er aim'd at. What if I go to him? 'Twere well imagin'd. An honour so unlook'd for would excite A strong sensation in his gen'rous heart. I'll do it instantlyâBut, as I live, Hither he comes. Enter Cortez, Velasquez, and Soldiers. Welcome, most noble Cortez! Thou hast forestall'd my purpose. I had plann'd To visit thee. CORTEZ. I could not wait thy leisure. Stubborn necessity, which o'erleaps rule, Compell'd me hither.âPrince! thou hast deceiv'd me. MONTEZUMA. I a deceiver! CORTEZ. Yesâthou and thy people With treach'rous purpose 'gainst me have conspir'd. Are not thy troops on ev'ry hand assembling? MONTEZUMA. Dismiss such groundless fears: they are unworthy Of a great soul like thine. Thou hast my faith. CORTEZ. I have, and now can estimate it rightly. But wherefore lose we time in vain discourse? I come not here to parley: no smooth words, No specious promises will now avail thee. I must have more substantial evidence Of thy sincerity. MONTEZUMA. What dost require? CORTEZ. Such as alone can give security: A hostageâan effective pledgeâthyself. Go with us to our fortress. MONTEZUMA. I go with you? Give myself up a captive? This to me, To Montezuma? Am I bearded thus In mine own palace?âHo! my guards! CORTEZ. Be silent! Breathe but a word, and to thy inmost heart Shall pierce my weapon.âCircle him around! Forward!âNow, Mexico, I have secur'd thee! [Exeunt. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. A public Place in Mexico. Enter Telasco, Orozimbo, and Soldiers. SOLDIERS. Long live Telasco! OROZIMBO. Silence! See ye not He waves his hand, as if he will'd to address you? TELASCO. Friends, citizens, rein in awhile the ardour Which thus incites you to assert the cause Of Montezuma, of your menac'd country, Your children and yourselves, and list to me. Should the time come, when, to preserve those pledges, Your service is requir'd, stand forth like men, Unsheath your swords, and cast away your scabbards. Meantime, let prudence guide you. While these strangers Offend us not, while with observance due They keep their faith with us, do not forget They are your guests, who have a claim on you For lib'ral succour and assur'd protection. Here then keep station, under arms remain, With faith untainted heedful of the truce By Montezuma with these strangers made, But ever watchful, vigilant, alertâ Enter Guatimozin. GUATIMOZIN. Where is Telasco?âOh my gallant friend! Fate on our heads its deadliest vengeance pours: Worse than whate'er our anxious fears presag'd, Our faithless foes have perpetrated.âHaste! As thou'rt a man, exert thyself to save Our wrong'd, our captiv'd king! TELASCO. Captiv'd? GUATIMOZIN. Aye, captiv'dâ Scarce had we left him, when the Spaniards cameâ Cortez himself the band perfidious led. With impious hands they seiz'd himâ TELASCO. In his palace? Surrounded by his guard? Impossible! GUATIMOZIN. I marvel not thou doubt'st it. 'Tis beyond All credence.âList to me.âWhen they beheld Their monarch thus insulted, his attendants Indignantly rushed forward to his aid. As they approach'd, Cortez with air resolv'd Advanc'd. With his left hand he grasp'd the king, While in his right his threat'ning sword he brandish'd. âKeep off,â he cried, âif any make resistance, âDeep in your monarch's heart I plunge my blade!â They heard him, and fell back. TELASCO. Oh cowards, traitors! Was there not one, not one among them all Of texture firm enough to dare his threats?â What! All desert him! No one stand by him! Oh shame, shame, shame!âIt maddens me to think Of such unblushing cow'rdice!âWhere is he? Where have the ruffians ta'en him? GUATIMOZIN. To their fort. There he remains, while in array their forces Stand marshall'd 'gainst us. TELASCO. He may yet be sav'd! On to the charge, my friends! Let's strike them homeâ GUATIMOZIN. Stay yet awhile, I pray thee. Are we sure To what extent of dread atrocity These ruffians may be driv'n, should we by force Attempt our king's release?âThey may be urg'd To perpetrate a still more dreadful deedâ TELASCO. They dare not touch his consecrated head: The guardian spirit of our realm will watch Over his life, and sanction our endeavours. One course alone remains for us, and that, Thank heav'n! we've nerves and courage to fulfil. Let us assail them manfully, and teach them What men can do when honour goads them on. GUATIMOZIN. Lead us against them. Him who first deserts thee With endless ruin may the gods o'erwhelm! TELASCO. On thenâOur cause is that of heav'n itself. Oh thou, great spirit! whose protecting hand Rules o'er our destiny, inspire us now! Ward from our sacred king the felon brand Levell'd by treason 'gainst him! But should fate Frustrate our hopes, oh! let us live to glory, Or die like heroes!âForward, my brave friends! [Exeunt. SCENE II. Cortez's Palace. Enter Cortez, Velasquez, and Salceda. CORTEZ. So far, so wellâNow to derive advantage From our great prize.âSalceda, take thou charge Of our illustrious captive, as our hostage To insure us favourable terms, should fortune Grow adverse to us. See thou guard'st him well. [Exit Salceda. Velasquez! are the battlements well lin'd, And is sufficient force drawn up without, Should any try to force a sudden entrance? VELASQUEZ. Ayeâlet them try itâthey shall learn a lesson Will teach them wisdom.âTalk of paltry Indians! They face such men as we!âDid'st thou not note them, When through their ranks we led their trembling king, How with astonishment they gaz'd on us, And shook like aspins in a northern blast? No, noâthey'll not presume to cope with us. CORTEZ. We know not yet what desp'rate men may do. The timid stag, who flies the rav'nous pack, When hardly press'd will boldly stand at bay, And in his turn become aggressor.âWellâ Enter Gonsalvo. What new intelligence? GONSALVO. None of good import. The citizens are up in armsâthe streets Are fill'd with multitudesâfar as the ear Can catch the sounds, clamours and shouts are heard, The clarion's piercing bray, cymbals and drums, As if from ev'ry quarter were assembling A congregated force for their king's rescue. CORTEZ. Such beyond doubt is what they meditate. It is a critical and awful momentâ [He stands musing. GONSALVO. 'Tis now too late to remedy the evil; Yet think I still the better course had been To treat indulgently this friendly people. VELASQUEZ. Indulgence!âBut I do remember meâ Thou art converted. Sympathy, fine feelings, Are now it seems the fashionâ GONSALVO. I shall find A time more fit to notice those proud taunts. CORTEZ. Fie on such jars! Is this a time for squabbles, When a whole empire is combin'd against us? Give o'er, I pray.âWho is it heads their forces? GONSALVO. On ev'ry hand resounds Telasco's name. CORTEZ. Ayeâhe's a leader who will find us work. Hark! heard ye not?âThey are already here. Louder and louder still!âNow is our time: Let us not tamely their assault await. Do thou, Velasquez! sally forth: assail them; To Montezuma's palace force thy way; Maintain it as thy postâ VELASQUEZ. 'Twill be a prize Worth running risk for, and I thank thee for it. I'll forth o' th' instant.âFarewell, moralizer! If thou'rt in earnest, we shall meet again. GONSALVO. We will, be sure on't. CORTEZ. Heed him not. He's rough, But a brave soldier.âI must forth myselfâ We all must bear our parts.âSummon my guardsâ Now may St. James and Spanish valour aid us! [Exeunt. SCENE III. A public place in Mexico. [Shouts, Trumpets, Horns, &amp;c. heard in various directions. Indians running across the Stage, pursued by Spaniards.] Enter Velasquez and Zelama. VELASQUEZ. Think not to 'scape meâThou art fairly mineâ I won thee, and will keep thee. ZELAMA. Oh in pity! If thou can'st feel compassionâif thy heartâ VELASQUEZ. This prud'ry is mistim'dâI hold thee fastâ Let's see who'll rescue thee! ZELAMA. Hear me, oh hear me! VELASQUEZ. What! when thy beauties fire my soul?âNo, noâ Come onâThis is no place to parley inâ ZELAMA. Where art thou, my Telasco! Enter Gonsalvo. (Zelama breaks from Velasquez, and runs to him. Gen'rous stranger! Thou art not like thy fellowsâThou canst feelâ Save me! Protect me! GONSALVO. Heav'ns! Zelama here! By what strange chanceâWho tore thee from thy palace? VELASQUEZ. 'Twas I! Velasquez! As with my brave comrades Through Montezuma's halls I rang'd, I found her. I left to other care his gems and gold, And seiz'd her for myself. GONSALVO. Shame on the deed! VELASQUEZ. Wilt thou dispute her with me? I remember Thou seem'd'st dispos'd to pick a quarrel with me. If yet thy valour be awake, this may be As good a cause as any. GONSALVO. Hence! be gone! I'm her protectorâtouch her if thou dar'st. VELASQUEZ. These words to me?âCome on thenâtake thy fate! (They fight. Enter Telasco, with his force. GONSALVO. Retreat'st thou? VELASQUEZ (pointing to Telasco). See'st him not?âWhat demon sent him Here with his myrmidons?âThis is no time For private tilting.âWe shall meet again. [Exit. ZELAMA. Oh my Telasco! TELASCO. My Zelama here! ZELAMA. Now am I safeâ TELASCO. Have then these ruffians dar'dâ But they shall answer for it. ZELAMA. Stopâforbearâ Aim not thy sword 'gainst himâhe's my protector. When the fierce Spaniards broke into the palace, A stern barbarian seiz'd me as his prey. Deaf to my cries, and reckless of my tears, Here had he forc'd me on, when pitying heav'n Sent this young warrior to mine aid. He sav'd me. TELASCO. Myriads of blessings light upon him for it! How can I thank thee best? GONSALVO. I've done no more Than mere humanity requir'd. The soldier, Who sees a lovely woman in distress And flies not to her succour, is unworthy Of that proud title. TELASCO. Thou art truly noble 'Tis pity thou'rt a Spaniard. I had sworn To hate all those who bear that odious name; But I cannot hate thee. Noâby this hand I love thee, and will recompence thy service. GONSALVO. I ask no recompence but mine own feelings, And those are amply gratified already. Farewellâanother duty calls me hence. ZELAMA. Wilt thou then leave us? GONSALVO. Ask me not to stay. Thou need'st no help; Telasco's arm protects thee. But there's another and a graver cause Which hurries me away. Thy Montezumaâ I know not what new perils may assail him. My presence mayâ ZELAMA. Oh stay not, I implore thee! Lose not a momentâflyâ GONSALVO. I will obey thee. [Exit. ZELAMA. Heav'n's blessing light on thee, thou gen'rous youth!â Where can I turn me now? TELASCO. I will conduct thee Back to the palace. ZELAMA. There's no safety there. The cruel Spaniards are its masters now. I have no friend to save me but thyself. Thou wilt not leave me? TELASCO. No! While this heart beats, Mine arm shall guard thee. Come with me, my loveâ Take courageâNone shall harm thee. Since fate wills it, We will together face the storm of war. (To his followers) âBehold, my gallant comrades, your new leader, Your monarch's sister, now become associate In the brave cause which animates us all! Follow her steps to glory and to conquest! (Loud cries. ZELAMA. Alas! What mean those shouts, those piercing cries? 'Tis from the Spanish fort they comeâMy brother! My hapless brother!âHear'st thou?âThere againâ Enter Capana. CAPANA. Oh day for ever curs'd!âAlas! I come Charg'd with intelligence to rend your hearts. ZELAMA. It was! It was! My boding soul foretold it. TELASCO. Be not thus agitated.âSpeak, I charge thee. CAPANA. When our brave troops had nearly scal'd the fort, The warrior, who commanded on the summit, Brought forth our king, and plac'd him in the front, Where rag'd the strife most hotly. Struck with awe Our host th' assault suspended; when the king Address'd themâsaid he came there willinglyâ TELASCO. It cannot beâHe never could say soâ CAPANA. Our people seem'd confoundedâ TELASCO. Well they mightâ ZELAMA. Oh! interrupt him notâ CAPANA. A mournful silence Reign'd for a moment; but, when they beheld Their king surrounded by his foes, disrob'd Of royal state, and as a captive led To plead against himself, their fury roseâ A show'r of arrowsâCan I say't?âHe fell! ZELAMA. Curs'd be the hand which struck his sacred life! My brain's on fire!âOh brother! Montezuma! [She faints. TELASCO. They fatal words have pierc'd her to the heart. Oh! bear her from this scene of misery, Defend, protect her in this hour of trial, Find, if thou canst, some refuge for her woes, 'Till heav'n the doom of Mexico decide. [Capana bears her off. Now, fate, thy worst is o'er!âCome all the terrors Which our indignant gods can pour upon us! Havock, destruction, horror, and dismay, Now we defy you. On to the proof, my friends! Rush like a torrent on these perjur'd Spaniardsâ See where they come propitious to my wishâ And Cortez at their headâ Enter Cortez and Soldiers. Turn, base dissembler! Behold Telasco dares thee to the proof! This blade shall reach thy trait'rous heartâ CORTEZ. Away! I scorn a foe like thee, thee whom the tongue Of a weak, wheedling woman could seduce. TELASCO. Tax me with breach of faith! Yon heav'n, which witness'd Thy monstrous perjuries, will nerve my arm To wreak just vengeance for a murder'd kingâ CORTEZ. Take then the fate thou temp'stâ [They fight. Telasco falls. TELASCO. Thou hast prevail'dâ CORTEZ. First to thy sov'reign faithless, then to me, What else could'st thou expect? TELASCO. Rail on! Upbraid me For having thought thee honestâhence! begone! Thy sight is hateful to meâ CORTEZ. Fare thee well. On, my brave friends, to conquest and to glory! [Exeunt Cortez and Soldiers. TELASCO. Oh my poor country! Must these cruel spoilers Thus triumph o'er thy downfall?âGuatimozin! Enter Guatimozin and Soldiers. Thou'rt come in time to take my last adieuâ GUATIMOZIN. Oh my Telasco! Is it thus I meet thee? Let me convey thee henceâ TELASCO. Thy cares are vainâ This mortal conflict shortly will be o'er, And I shall rest.âDefend our hapless countryâ Avenge our murder'd kingâand if Zelamaâ Why that averted eyeâthat heaving breast? Is sheâspeak quicklyâ GUATIMOZIN. All her cares are over. Her brother's fate seal'd hers. TELASCO. High heav'n be thank'd! Oh my Zelama! my belov'd! farewell! Farewell a little space!âThough here we part, Ne'er in this cruel world to meet again, In those blest realms of rapturous delight, Where joys eternal wait on suff'ring virtue, Our disembodied souls, again united, Shall meet to part no more!âGive me thy handâ My breath grows shortâa film comes o'er mine eyesâ Our countryâMexicoâprotect it!âoh!â(Dies.) [Exeunt omnes. THE END.</field>
