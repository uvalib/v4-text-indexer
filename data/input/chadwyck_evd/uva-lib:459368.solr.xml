      <field name="fulltext">A most pleasant Comedie of Mucedorus the Kings sonne of Valentia, and Amadine, the kings daughter of Arragon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eight persons may easily play it. The King and Rombelo. for one. Mucedorus the prince of Valensia. for one. Amadine the Kinges daughter of Arragon. for one. Segasto a Noble man. for one. Enuie: Tremelio a Captaine, Bremo a wilde man. for one. Comedy, a boy, an ould woman, Ariena Amadines maide. for one. Collen a Counseller, A messenger. for one. Mouse the Clowne. for one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Comedie ioyfull with a garland of baies on her head. Why so? thus doe I hope to please: Musicke reuiues, and mirth is tollerable. Comedie play thy part, and please, Mak merry them that coms to ioy with thee: Ioy then good gentilles, I hope to make you laugh. Sound foorth Bellonas siluer tuned strings. Time fits vs well, the daie and place is ours. Enter Enuie, his armes naked besmearde with bloud En. Nay staie minion, there lies a block. What al on mirth; Ile interrupt your tale. And mixe your musicke with a tragick end. Co. What monstrous vgly hagge is this, That dares comtrowle the pleasures of our will? Vaunt churlish curre, besmearde with gorie bloud, That seemst to check the blossoms of delight, And stifle the sound of sweete Bellonas breath, Blush, monster blush, and post away with shame, That seekest disturbance of a goddesse deedes. En. Post hence thy selfe, thou counterchecking trul, I will possesse this habite spite of thee And gaine the glorie of thy wished porte, Ile thunder musicke shall appale the nimphes, And make them sheuer their clattering strings: Flying for succour to their danes caues. Sound drumes within and crie stab stab. Hearken, thou shalt hear a noise Shall fill the aire with a shrilling sound, And thunder musicke to the gods aboue: Mars shall himselfe breathe downe A peerelesse crowene vpon braue enuies head, And raise his chiuall with a lasting fame In this braue musicke Enuie takes delight, Where I may see them wallow in there blood, To spurne at armes and legges quite shiuered off, And heare the cries of many thousand slaine, How likst thou this my trull, this sport alone for mee? Co. Vaunt bloodie curre, nurst vp with tygers sapp, That so dost seeke to quaile a womans minde, Comedie is mild, gentle, willing for to please, And seekes to gaine the loue of all estates. Delighting in mirth, mixt all with louely tales, And bringeth things with treble ioy to passe, Thou bloodie, Enuious, disdainer of mens ioye, Whose name is fraught with bloodie stratagemes, Delights in nothing but in spoyle and death, Where thou maist trample in their luke warme blood, And graspe their hearts within thy cursed pawes: Yet vaile thy mind, reuenge thou not on mee, A silly woman begs it at thy hands, Giue me the leaue to vtter out my play, Forbeare this place, I humblie craue thee hence, And mixe not death amongst pleasing comedies, That treats naught els but pleasure and delight. If any sparke of humaine rests in thee, Forbeare, be gon, tender the suite of mee. En. Why so I wil, forbearance shall be such As treble death shall crosse thee with despight, And make thee mourne where most thou ioiest, Turning thy mirth into a deadly dole: Whirling thy pleasures with a peale of death, And drench thy methodes in a sea of bloud This will I doe, thus shall I beare with thee And more to vex thee with a deeper spite, I will with threates of bloud begin thy play: Fauoring thee with enuie and with hate. Co. Then vglie monster doe thy woorst, I will defend them in despite of thee: And thought thou thinkst with tragick fumes To braue my play vnto my deepe disgrace. I force it not, I scorne what thou canst doe Ile grace it so, thy selfe shall it confesse: From tragick stuffe to be a pleasant comedie. En. Why then Comedie send thy actors forth And I will crosse the first steps of their tread: Making them feare the verie dart of death. Co. And Ile defend them mangre all thy spite So vgly fiend, frewell, tell time shall serue, That we may meete to parle for the best. En. Content Comedie, ile goe spread my branch, And scattered blossomes from mine enuious tree. Exit. Shall proue to monsters, spoiling of their ioyes. Enter Segasto runing and Amadine after him, being persued with a beare Se. Oh fly Madam, fly or els weart but dead. Ama. Help Segasto help, help swet Segasto or ele I die. Segasto runnes away. Alas madam, there is no way but flight, Then hast and saue your selfe. Ama. Why then I die, ah helpe me in distresse, Enter Mucedorus like a shepheard with a sworde drawne and a beares head in his hande. Mu. Stay Lady stay, and be no more dismaide, That cruell beast most mercelesse and fell, Which haue bereaued thousands of their liues, Affrighted many with his hard pursues, Prying from place to place to find his praie, Prolonging thus his life by others death, His carcasse now lies headlesse void of breth. Ama. That fowle deformed monster is he dead? Mu. Assure your selfe thereof, behould his head: Which if it please you Lady to accept, With willing heart I yeeld it to your maiestie. Ama. Thankes worthy shepheard, thanks a thousand times This gift assure thy selfe contents me more, Then greatest bountie of a mighty prince: Although he were the monarch of the world. Mu. Most gracious goddesse, more then mortal wight, Your heauenly hewe of right imports no lesse, Most glad am I in that it was my chance, To vndertake this enterprise in hand. Which doth so greatly glad your princely minde. Ama. No goddesse shepheard, but a mortall wight A mortall wight destressed as thou seest: My father heere is king of Arragon. I Amadine his only daughter am: And after him sole heire vnto the crowne. Now where as it is my fathers will, To mary me vnto Segasto, On whose welth through fathers former vsury Is knowen to be no lesse then woonderfull, We both of custome oftentimes did vse, Leauing the court to walke within the fieldes, For recreation esecially the spring, In that it yelds greate store of rare delights: And passing further then our wonted walkes, Scarse were entred within these lucklesse woods, But right before vs downe a steepe fall hil A monstrous vgly beare did hie him fast, To meete vs both, I faint to tell the rest, Good shepherd, but suppose the gastly lookes, The hiddious feares, the thousant hunderd woes, Which at this instant Amadine susteind. Mu. Yet worthy princes let thy sorrow cease, And let this sight your former ioyes reuiue. Ama. Beleeue me shepheard so it doth no lesse. Mu. Long may they last vnto your hearts content. But tell me Ladie what is become of him, Segasto calld, what is become of him? Ama. I knowe not I, that knowe the powers diuine, But God graunt this that sweet Segasto liue. Mu. Yet heard harted he in such a case, So cowardly to saue himselfe by flight: And leaue so braue a princesse to the spoyle. Ama. Well shephearde for thy worthy valour tried, Endangering thy selfe to set me free: Vnrecompensed sure thou shalt not be. In court thy courage shalbe plainely knowne: Throughout the Kingdome will I spread thy name, To thy renowne and neuer dying fame: And that thy courage may be better knowne. Beare thou the head of this most monstrous beast In open fight to euerie courtiers viewe So will the king my father thee rewarde. Come lets away, and guard me to the court. Mu. With all my heart. Exeunt. Enter Segasto solus. Se. When heapes of harmes do houer ouer head, Tis time as then, some say to looke about, And so ensuing harmes to choose the least: But hard, yea haplesse is that wretchesse chaunce, Lucklesse his lot and caytiffe like a courste, At whose proceedings fortune euer frownes. My selfe I meane most subiect vnto thrall, For I the more I seeke to shun the worst: The more by proofe I find my selfe accurst: Ere whiles assaulted with an vgly beare, Fayre Amadine in company all alone, Forthwith by flight I thought to saue my selfe, Leauing my Amadine vnto her shiftes. For death it was for to resist the beare. And death no lesse of Amadines harmes to heare. Accursed I in lingring life thus long, In leeuing thus each minute of an hower Doth pierce my hart with dartes of thousand deathes: If she by flight her fury doe escape, What will she thinke; Will she not say; yea flatly to my face, Accusing me of meere disloyaltie, A trustie friend is tride time of neede: But I when she in danger was of death And needed me, and cried Segasto helpe: I turned my backe and quickly ran away. Vnworthy I to beare this vitall breath: But what, what needes these plaintes If Amadine do liue then happie I, Shee will in time forgiue and so forget, Amadine is mercifull, not Iuno like. In harmful hart to harbor hatred long. Enter Mouse the Clowne running crying clubs. Mouse. Clubs, prongs, pitchforks, billes, O helpe, a beare, a beare, a beare. Se. Still beares, and nothing else but beares. Tell me sirra wher she is; Clo. O sir, she is runne downe the woods: I see her wite head and her white belly. Se. Thou talkest of wonders, to tell me of white bears. But sirra didst thou euer see any such; Clo. No faith I neuer sawe any such, But I remember my fathers woordes, Hee bad mee take heade I was not caught with a white beare Se. A lamentable tale no dout. Clo. I tell you what sir as I was going a fielde to serue my fathers great horse, &amp; caried a bottly of hay vpon my head, now doe you see sir, I fast hudwinckt, that I could see nothing, perceiuing the beare comming, I threw my hay into the hedge and ran away. Se. What from nothing. Clo. I warrant you yes, I saw something, for there was tow loade of thornes besides my bottle of hay, and that made three. Se. But tell me sirra, the beare that thou didst see, Did she not beare a bucket on her arme; Clo. Ha ha, ha, I neuer saw beare goe a milking in all my life. But hark you sir, I did not looke so hie as her arme: I saw nothing but her whit head, and her whit belly. Se. But tell me sirra, where doost thou dwell; Clo. Why, doe you not knowe mee? Se. Why no, how should I know thee. Clo. Why then you know no bodie, and you knowe not mee' I tell you sir I am the goodman ratsson of the next parish ouer the hill. Se. Goodman ratsson why whats thy name, Clo. why I am very neere kin vnto him. Se. I thinke so, but whats thy name? Clo. My name, I haue very pretie name Ile tel you what my name is: my name is Mouse, Se. what plaine Mouse. Clo. I, plaine mouse with out either welt or garde. But doe you heare sir I am but a very young mouse, For my taile is scarce growne out yet, looke you here els. Se. But I pray thee, who gaue thee that name? Clo. Fayth sir I know not that, but if you would faine know, aske my fathers greate horse, for he hath bin halfe a yeare longer with my father then I haue. Se. This seemes to be a merrie fellow, I care not if I take him home with me, Mirth is a comfort to a troubled minde, A merrie man, a merrie master makes. How saist thou sirra, wilt thou dwell with me? Clo. Nay soft sir, tow words to a bargaine, praie you what occupation are you? Se. No occupation, I liue vpon my landes. Clo. Your lands, away, you are no maister for me, why doe you thinke that I am so mad, to go seke my liuing in the lands amongst the stones, briars, and bushes, and teare my holy day apparell, not I by your leaue. Se. Why, I do not meane thou shalt. Clo. How then? Se. Why thou shalt be my man, and waite vpon me at the court. Clo. Whats that? Se. Where the King lies. Clo. Whats that same King a man or woman? Se. A man as thou arte. Clo. As I am, harke you sir pray you what kin is he to good man king of our parish the church warden? Se. No kin to him, he is the King of the whole land. Clo. king of the land, I neuer see him. Se. If thou wilt dwel with me, thou shallt see him euerie day. Clo. shall I go home againe to be torne in peces with beares, no not I, I wil go home &amp; put on a cleane shirt, and then goe drowne my selfe. Se. Thou shallt not need, if thou wilt dwell with me, thou shalt want nothing. Clo. Shal I not? then heares my hand, ile dwel with you, And harke you sir, now you haue entertained me, I wil tell you what I can doe, I can keepe my tongue from picking and stealing, and my handes from lying and slaundering, I warrant you, as wel as euer you had man in all your life. Se. Now will I to court with sorrowfull hart, rownded with doubts, if Amadine doe liue, then happy I: yea happie I if Amadine doe liue. Exeunt. Enter the King with a young prince prisoner, Amadine with Collen and counsellers. King. Now braue Lords, our wars are brought to end, Our foes the foile and we in safetie rest, It vs behoues to vse such clemencie in peace, As valour in the warre. It is as great honor to be bountifull at home, As to be conquerers in the field. Therefore my Lords the more to my content, Your liking, and your countries safegarde, We are disposde in marriage for to giue Our daughter to Lord Segasto heare, Who shall succeede the diadem after me: And raigne heereafter as I tofore haue done Your sole and lawfull King of Arragon: What say you Lordings, like you of my aduise? Col. And please your Maiesty, we doe not onely alowe of your highnesse pleasure, but also vow fathfully in what we may to further it. King. Thankes good my Lords, if long Adrostus liue Hee will at full requite your curtesies. Tremelio in recompence of thy late valour done, Take vnto thee the Catalone a prince, Latelie our prisoner taken in the warres Be thou his keeper, his ransome shallbe thine, Weele thinke of it when leasure shall afforde: Meane while doe vse him well, his father is a King. Tre. Thankes to your Maiestie, his vsage shalbe such, As he therat shall thinke no cause to grutce. Exeunt. King. Then march we on to court, and rest our wearied limmes But Collen, I haue a tale in secret kept for thee: When thou shalt heare a watch woord from thy king, Thinke then some waightie matter is at hand That highlie shall concerne our state, Then Collen looke thou be not farre from me: And for thy seruice thou to fore hast done, Thy trueth and valour proude in euerie point, I shall with bounties thee enlarge therefore: So guard vs to the courte. Col. What so my soueraigne doth commaund me doe, With willing mind I gladly yeeld consent Exeunt. Enter Segasto and the Clowne, with weapons about him Se.

Se. Well sir away. Tremelio this it is, thou knowest the valour of Segasto Spred through all the kingdome of Arragon, And such as hath found triumph and fauours, Neuer daunted at any tyme, but now a shepherd, Admired at in court for worthynesse. And Segastoes honour layd a side. My wil therefore is this, that thou dost find som meanes to worke the shepheardes death, I know thy strength sufficient to performe my desire, &amp; thy loue no other wise then to reuenge my iniuries. Tre. It is not the frownes of a shepheard that Tremelio feares. Therefore account it accomplished, what I take in hane Se.

Ah Tremelio, trustie Tremelio, I sorrow for thy death, And since that thou liuing, didst prooue faithfull to Segasto, so Segasto now liuing shall honoure the dead corpes of Tremlio with reuenge. Bloud thristy villaine, borne and bredde to mercilesse murther, Tell me how durst thou be so bold. As once to lay thy hands vpon the least of mine. Assure thy selfe, thou shalt be vsd according to the law. Mu. Segasto cease, these threats are needlesse Accuse not me of murther, that haue done nothing but in mine owne defence. Se. Nay shepheard reason not with me. Ile manifest thy fact vnto the King: Whose doome will be thy death as thou deserust, What hoe, Mouse come away. Clo. Why how now, whats the matter.

Mu. behold the fickle state of man, alwaies mutable, neuer at one. Somtimes we feed on fancies with the sweete of our desires. Somtimes againe we feele the heat of extreame miserie. Now am I in fauour about the court and countrie. To morrow those fauours will turne to frownes, To daie I liue reuenged on my foe, To morrow I die, my foe reuenged on me, Exeunt. Enter Bremo a wild man. Bre. No passengers this morning, what not one. A chance that seldome doth befall. What not one, then lie thou there, And rest thy selfe til I haue further neede: Now Bremo sith thy leasure so affords. An endlesse thing, who knowes not Bremoes strength Who like a king commander within these woods, The beare, the boare, dares not abide my sight, But hastes away to saue themselues by flight: The christall waters in the bubbling brookes, When I come by doth swiftly slide away, And claps themselues in closets vnder bankes, Afraide to looke bold Bremo in the face: The aged okes at Bremoes breath doe bowe, And all things els are still at my commaund, Els What would I? Rent them in peeces and plucke them from the earth, And each waie els I would reuenge my selfe, Why who comes heere with whome I dare not fight, Who fights with me &amp; doth not die the death; not on: What fauour shewes this sturdie sticke to those, That heere within these woods are combataines with me? Why death and nothing else but present death, With restlesse rage I wander through these woods, No creature heere but feareth Bremoes force, Man, woman, child, beast and bird, And euery thing that doth approch my sight, Are forst to fall it Bremo once but frowne, Come cudgel come, my partner in my spoiles, For heere I see this daie it will not be, But when it falles that I encounter anie, One pat suffised for to worke my wil. What comes not one? then lets be gon, A time will serue when we shal better speed. Exit. Enter the King, Segasto, the Shepheard and the Clowne with others. King. Shephard, thou hast heard thine accusers, Murther is laid to thy charge, What canst thou say, thou hast deserued death; Mu. Dread soueraigne, I must needes confesse, I slewe this captaine in mine owne defence, Not of any malice but by chance, But mine accuser hath a further meaning. Se. woords will not heere preuaile, I seek for iustice, &amp; iustice craues his death. King. Shepheard thine owne confession hath condemned thee. Sirra take him away, &amp; doe him to execution straight. Clo. So hee shall I warrant him, but doe you heare maister King, he is kin to a monkie, his necke is bigger then is head. Se. Com sirra away with him, and hang him about the middle. Clo. Yes, forsooth I warrant you, come on sir, a so like a sheepe biter a lookes. Enter Amadine and a boie with a beares head Ama. Dread soueraigne and welbe loued sire. On bended kees I craue the life of this condemned shepheard, which heertofore preserued the life of thy sometime distressed daughter. K. preserued the life of my somtime distressed daughter How can that be; I neuer knew the time Whrein thou wast distrest, I neuer knew the daie But that I haue maintained thy state, As best beseemd the daughter of a king I neuer saw the shepheard vntil now, How comes it then that he preserud thy life? Ama. Once walkeing with Segasto in the woods, Further then our accustomed maner was, Right before vs downe a steepe fal hill, A monstrous vgly beare doth hie him fast To meete vs both, now whether this bee trewe, I referre it to the cerdit of Segasto. Se. Most trew and like your maiestie. King. How then? Ama. The beare being eager to obtaine his praie; Made forward to vs with an open mouth, As if he meant to swallow vs both at once, The sight whereof did make vs both to dread, But speciallie your daughter Amadine, Who for I saw no succour incident But in Segastoes valour, I grew desperate, And he most cowardlike began to fly. Left me distrest to be deuourd of him, How say you Segasto is it not true? K. His silence verifies it to be true, what then? Ama. Then I amasde dstressed all alone, Did hie me fast to scape that vglie beare, But all in vaine, for why he reached after me, And hardly I did oft escape his pawes, Till at the length this shepheard came, And brought to me his head. Come hither boy, loe heere it is, which I present vnto your maiestie. Ki. The slaughter of this beare deserues great fame. Se. The slaughter of a man deserues greate blame. King. Indeed occasion oftentimes so falles out. Se. Tremelio in the wars. O King preserued thee, Ama. The shepheard in the woods o king preserued me. S. Tremelio fought when many men did yeeld. Ama. So would the shepheard had he bin in field Clo. So would my maister, had he not run away. Se. Tremelioes force saued thousands from the foe. Ama. The shepheards force haue saued thousand, more. Clo. Aye shipstickes, nothing else. King. Segasto cease to accuse the shepheard, His woorthynesse deserues a recompence, All we are bound to doe the shepheard good: Shepheard, whereas it was my sentence, thou shouldst die, So shall my sentence stand, for thou shalt die. Se. Thankes to your maistie. King. But soft Segasto, not for this offence, Long maist thou liue, and when the sisters shal decree To cut in twaine the twisted thread of life, Then let him die, for this I set thee free, And for thy valour I will honour thee. Mu. Thankes to your maiestie. King. Come daughter let vs now departe, to honour the worthy valour of the shepheard with our rewards. Exeunt. Clo. O mayster heare you, you haue made a freshe hand now you would be slowe you, why what will you doe nowe? you haue lost me a good occupation by the meanes, Faith maister now I cannot hang the shepheard, I pray you let me take the paines to hang you, it is but halfe an houres exercise. Se. You are still in your knauery, but sith I cannot haue his life I will procure his banishment for euer. Come on sirra. Clo. Yes forsooth I come laugh at him I pray you. Exeunt Enter Mucedorus solus. Mu.

Whose woordes are these? came these from Amadine? Mess. Aye from Amadine. Clo. Aye from Amadine. Mu. Ah luckelesse fortune worse then Phaetons tale, My former blesse is now become my bale. Clo. What wilt thou poyson thy selfe? Mu. My former heauen is now become my hell. Clo. The worst ale house that I euer came in, in al my life. Mu. What shall I doe. Clo. Euen goe hang thy selfe halfe an nower. Mu. Can Amadine so churelishly commaund. To banish the shepheard from her Fathers court? Mess. What should shepheardes doe in the court. Clo. What should shepherrdes doe amongst vs, haue we not Lordes inough on vs in the courte? Mu. Why shepheardes are men, and kinges are no more. Mess. Shepheardes are men and maisters ouer their flocke Clo. Thats a lie who payes them their wages then? Mes. Well you are alwayes interrupting of me, But you are best looke to him least you hang for him when he is gone. Exit. The Clowne sings. Clo. And you shall hang for companie, For leauing me alone. Shepheard stand foorth and heare thy sentence, Shepheard begone within three dayes in payne of, My displeasure, shepheard begon, shepheard begon, begon, begon, begon, shepheard, shepheard, shepheard Exit. Mu. And must I goe, and must I needs depart? Ye goodly groues partakers of my songes In tyme tofore when fortune did not frowne, Powre foorth your plaints and waile a while with me And thou bright sunne my comfort in the cold, Hide, hide thy face and leaue me comfortlesse, Ye holsome hearbes, and sweete smelling sauours, Ye each thing els prolonging life of man, Change, change your wonted course, That I wanting your aide, in woefull sort may die, Enter Amadine. Ama. Arinea if any body aske for mee, Make some excuse till I returne. Ari. What and Segasto call. Ama. Do thou the like to him, I mean not to stay long. Mu.

Shepheard, although thy banishment already be decreed and all agaynst thy will, yet Amadine. Mu. Ah Amadine, to heare of banishment is death, I double death to me, but since I must depart, one thing I craue. Ama. Say on with all my heart. Mu. That in absence either farre or neere. You honoor me as seruant with your name. Ama. Not so. Mu. And why? Ama. I honour thee as soueraigne with my heart. Mu. A shepheard and a soueraigne nothing like. Ama. Yet like enough where there is no dislike. Mu. Yet great dislike or els no banishment. Ama. Shepheard, it is onely Segasto that procures thy banishment. Mu. Vnworthy wightes are most in ielosie. Ama. Would God they would free the from banishment, or likewise bamish mee. Mu. Amen say I, to haue your companie. Ama. Well shepheard, sith thou sufferest this for my sake, with thee in exile also let me liue. On this condition shepheard thou canst loue. Mu. No longer loue no longer let me liue: Ama. Of lat I loued one indeed, now loue I none but onely thee. Mu. Thankes worthie princes I borne likewise, Yet smother vp the blast, I dare not promise what I may performe. Ama. Well shepheard, harke what I shall say, I will returne vnto my Fathers court. Therefore to prouide me of such nescessaries, As for our iourney I shall thinke most fit, This being done I will returne to thee, Doe thou therefore appoint the place where we may meete. Mu. Downe in the valley where I slue the beare, And there doth grow a faire broade branched beach, That ouer shades a well, so who comes first Let them abid the happie meeting of vs both. How like you this? Ama. I like it very wel. Mu. Now if you please you may appoint the time, Ama. Full three hours hence God willing, I will returne. Mu.

But what me thinks my shephard is not come? I muse at that, the hower is sure at hande, Well here ile rest till Mucedorus come. Shee sits her downe. Enter Bremo looking about, hastily taketh hould of her. Bremo. A hapie pray, now Bremo feede on flesh, Dainties Bremo dainties thy hungry panch to fill, Now glut thy greedie guts with luke warme blood, Come fight with me, I long to see thee dead. Ama.

It was my wil an hower a goe and more, As was my promise for to make returne, But other busines hindred my pretence.

How reare the towne euen goe your selfe, it is more then I can doe, why doe you thinke I can reare a towne, that can scarse reare a pot of ale to my heade? I should reare a towne should I not; Se. Go to the cunstable and make a priuie search, for the shephard is runne away with the Kings daughter. Clo. How? is the shepheard run away with the kings daughter. or is the kings daughter runne away with the shepheard. Se. I cannot tell, but they are both gon together Clo. What a foole is she to runne away with the shepheard, why I thinke I am a litle hansomer man then the shepheard my selfe, but tel me maister, must I make a priuie search, or search in the priuie; Se. why dost thou thinke they will be there; Clo.

Exit. Enter Mucedorus to disguise himselfe. Mu. Now Mucedorus whither wilt thou goe, Home to thy father to thy natiue soile, Or trie some long abode within these woods; Well I will hence depart and hie me home, What hie me home said I? that may not be. In Amadine rests my felicitie Then Mucedorus do as thou didst decree, Attire thee hermite like, within these grouees, Walke often to the beach and view the well. Make settles there and seate thy selfe thereon, And when thou feelest thy selfe to be a thrist, Then drinke a heartie draught to Amadine, No doubt she thinkes on thee, And wil one day come pleg thee at this well: Come habit thou art fit for me, he disguiseth himselfe: No shepheard now, a hermit I must be: Me thinkes this fits me verie well, Now must I learne to beare a walking staffe, And exercise some grauitie withall.

Exit. Bre. Amadine, how like you Bremo &amp; his woodes? Ama. As like the woods of Bremoes crueltie, Though I were dombe and could not answer him, The beastes themselues would with relenting teares Bewaile thy sauage and vnhumaine deedes. Bre.

Oh spare me Bremo loue should limit life, Not to be made a murderer of him selfe If thou wilt glut thy louing heart with blood, Encounter with the lion or the beare, And a like wolfe pray not vpon alambe. Bre. Why then dost thou repine at me? If thou wilt loue me thou shalt be my queene, I will crowne thee with a complet made of Iuorie, And make the rose and lilly wait on thee, Ile rend the burley braunches from the oke, To shadow thee from buring sunne. The trees shall spred themselues where thou dost go, And as they spread, ile trace along with thee, Ama. You may, for who but you? Bre: Thou shalt bee fed with quailes and partridges With blacke birds, larkes, thrushes and nightingales. Thy drinke shall bee goates milke and christal water, Distilled from the fountaines &amp; the clearest springs. And all the dainties that the woods afforde. Ile freely giue thee to obtaine thy loue. Ama. You may, for who but you? Bre. The day ile spend to recreate my loue, With all the pleasures that I can deuise, And in the night ile be thy bedfellow, And louingly embrace thee in mine armes. Ama. One may, so may not you. Bre. The satyres &amp; the woodnimphs shal attend on the And lull thee a sleepe with musickes sounde, And in the morning when thou dost awake The lark shall sing good morne to my queene, And whilst he singes ile kisse my Amadine. Ama. You may, for who but you. Br. When thou art vp, the wood lanes shalbe strawed With violets, cowslips and swete marigolds. For thee to trampel and to trace vpon, And I will teach thee how to kill the deare, To chase the hart and how to rowse the roe, If thou wilt liue to loue and honour mee. Ama. You may. for who but you? Enter Mucedorus. Bre. Welcomd sir, an howre ago I lookt for such a gest Be merrie wench, weele haue a frollike feast, Heeres flesh inough for to suffise vs both, Staie sirra, wilt thou fight or dost thou yeel to die? Mu.

Yet giue him leaue to speake for my sake. Bre: Speake on, but be not ouer long. Mu: In time of yore when men like brutish beasts. Did lead their liues in loathsom celles and woodes And wholy gaue themselues to witlesse will, A rude vnruly rout, then man to man be came A present praie, then might preuailed, The weakst went to walles, Right was vnknowen, for wrong was all in all. As men thus liued in his great outrage, Behould one Orpheus came as poets tell, And them from rudenes vnto reason brought, Who led by reason son some forsooke the woods, Insteade of caues they built them castles strong, Citties and townes were founded by them then, Glad wre they, they found such ease, And in the end they grew to perfect amitie, Waying their former wickednesse, They tearmd the time wherein they liued then A golden age, a goodly golden age. Now Bremo, for so I heare thee called. If men which liued to sore as thou dost now, Wilie in wood, addicted all to spoile, Returned were by worthy Orpheus meanes, Let me like Orpheus cause thee to returne From murder, bloudshed and like crueltie, What should we fight befor we haue a cause No, lets liue and loue together faithfully. Ile fight for thee. Bre. Fight forme or die, or fight or els thou diest. Ama. hold Bremo hold, Bre, Away I say, thou troublest mee, Ama. You promised me to make me your queenne. Bre.

Nay that emet that I saw was bigger then thou art R. Bigger then I what a foole haue you to your man, I pray you maister turne him away? Se. But dost thou heare, was he not a man. Clo. thinke he was, for he saide he did lead a salt-seller life about the woods. Se. Thon wouldest say a solitarie life about the woods Clo. I thinke it was so indeed. R. I thought what a foole thou art. Clo. Thou art a wise man, why he did nothing but sleepe since he went Se. But tell me Mouse, how did he goe; Clo. In a whit gowne and a whit hat on his head, and a staffe in his hande. Se. I thought so, it was a hermit that walked a solitarie life in the woods. Se.

Mu: Vnknowne to any heere within these woods With bloodie Bremo do I lead my life, The monster he doth murther all he meets, He spareth none and none doth him escape, Who would continue, vvho but onely I In such a cruell cutthroates company. Yet Amadine is there hovv can I choose: Ah sillie soule how often times she sits And sighes, and cals come shepheard come, Svveete Mucedorus, come and set me free, When Mucedorus pesent standes her by: But here she comes, what nevves faire Ladie as you vvalke, these vvoods.

Shall my sweete Bremo wander through the woods. Toile to and fro for to redresse my want, Hazard his life and all to cherishe me, I like not this quoth she And thereupon craude to know of me If I coulde teach her handle weapons well. My aunswerh was I had small skill therein, But gladmost mightie king to learne of thee. And this was all. Bre. Whast so; none can dislike of this. Ile teach you both to fight, but first my queene begin, Here take this weapon, see how thou canst vse it. Ama. This is to big, I cannot weeld it in my arme. Bre. Ist so, weele haue a knotty crab tree staffe for thee: But sirra tell me, what saist thou. Mu. With all my heart I willing am to learne. Bre. Then take my stafe &amp; see how canst weeld it. Mu.

Mu. Ay thats a question where of you may not be resolued, You know that I am banisht from the court, I know likewise each passage is beset, So that we cannot long escape vnknowne, Therefore my will is this, that we returne Right throught the thickets to the wild mans caue: And there a while liue on his prouision, Vntil the search and narrow watch be past. This is my counsel, and I thinke it best. Ama. I thinke the verie same. Mu. Come lets begone. The Clowne searches and fals ouer the wild man and so carry him away. Clo.

I cannot keepe thee as thy father did, I haue no landes for to maintaine thy state. Moreouer if thou meane to be my wife, Commonly this must be thy vse, To bed at midnight, vp at fowre, Drudge all daie and trudge from place to place, Whereby our dailie vittel for to winne: And last of all which is the worst of all, No princes then but plaine a shepheards wife.

Clo, I goe maister, I runne maister. Exeunt. Enter the King and Collen K. Break heart and end my paled woes, My amadine the comfort of my life, How can I ioy except she were in sight. Her absence breedes sorrow to my soule And with a thunder breakes my heart in twaine. Clo. Forbeare those passions gentle King, And you shall see twill turne vnto the best, And bring your soule to quiet and to ioie. K.

En. Though stumbled yet not ouerthrowne, Thou canst not draw my heart to mildenesse, Yet must I needes confesse thou hast don well, And plaide thy part with merth and pleasant glee: Saie all this, yet canst thou not conquer mee, Although this time thou hast got yet not the conquest neither. A double reuenge another time ile haue: Co. Then caitifie caitife cursed, stoope vpon thy knee Yeelde to a woman, though not to mee, And pray we both togither with our hearts, That she thrice Nestors yeares may with vs rest, And from her foes high God defend her still.

And forst me stoope vnto a womans swaie. God grant her grace amongest vs long may raigne, And those that would not haue it soe, Would that by enuie soone their heartes they might forgoe. Co.
