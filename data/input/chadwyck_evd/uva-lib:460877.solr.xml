      <field name="fulltext">SCENEâThe Coast of CORNWALL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âThe Shore on the Coast of Cornwall. Enter Philip, Ambrose, and others. Phil. Our craft is scandalized! We strip the dead! But what of that? The dead but want a grave! We give it them. We take what they can spare. Amb. You're right; we do no more! Phil. As to the rights Of the living, whom they leave behind, let men Look to their own! If not, why let it go! Is it for us to stand the drenching rain! Wade to our necks into the sea! perhaps Take boat and pull among the breakers, at The peril, every moment, of our lives, For their behoof, while they lie snug in bed, Loll o'er their fires, or sit around their feasts? Methinks there's reason in the wrecker's trade! Amb. There is. He risks, and toils, for what he gets. Phil. But then he does no mischief to the dead, More than the waves have done!âand if there be Among us, one that does, he's not of us. Those marks of violence, which hands alone, Not rocks, and waves, that have not hands, can leave, Are scandal to our name! Amb. 'Tis clear, foul play Hast oft of late been done, and chiefly there Enter Norris. Where Norris takes his stand! What right has he To make that reef his own? Nor. Who talks of me? What of Black Norris?âHumph!âYou envy him! âWhat right has he to make that reef his own?â The right you all would stand on, if you couldâ The right of might! Phil. Who thought of seeing him? Who dream'd that he was near? Nor. I am a dark And surly man!âAm I the worse for that? May not the heart that's here, be soft as yours? The man that's ever smiling, still speaks softâ And no one here would pass for such a manâ I'd never trust! He'll prove a hypocrite! The sky doth change its 'haviourâ'tis no rogue; And why not man that lives beneath the sky, If he be honest? Marks of violence On bodies wash'd ashore! You want to know How they came there? I'll tell youâWhy, by hands! Is not that frank?âI'll tell you something moreâ 'Twas not by mine. It follows not, because The hair is rough, the dog's a savage one! Amb. 'Tis true. Nor. Come, come, hang no man for his looks! The thing 's disgrace! Let's put a stop to it; And each man do his best, to find him out, That brings the shame upon usâbe it me, Or you, or him, or whomsoe'er it may; And hunt him not by looks! Such houndsâyou know What hounds are, I supposeâare oft at fault! Sleek looks may be companions to rough hearts! I have found it many a time! As for the reef You say I make my ownâyou're welcome to it! But take it if you dare. [Asideâgoes out. Amb. We've done him wrong. Phil. I know not. Amb. Think the best! Come; in the end It may be as he says. Whate'er we've thought, No guilt has been brought home to himâalthough His father is no better than he should be, And sees far lands, by favour of the law. Let's keep awake! Each think the watch his own! Whispers grow loud, and we must silence them, Else we'll be look'd to, and our trade at end! [They go out on different sides. SCENE II. âCliffsâwith the Shore in the DistanceâA Ship in the Offing. Enter Edward and Marian, hand in hand. Edw. Look blithe, my pretty Marian! The true heart Should ne'er be a misgiving one!âMy girl, My gentle girl, look blitheâDidst ever see So fair a day?âThere's scarce a cloud in sight! The breeze is just the one our vessel likes; Jib, spanker, all will draw! Tight-water boat, Stanch crew, bold captain,âMarian, what's to fear? Mari. Absence, that gives to lovers taste of death, And long protracted makes them wish for death, So wearisome to bear! When last you left, So long you stay'd,âlife, from a precious gift, Became a load, methought I could lay down, Nor deem it loss, but gain!âmy constant thought, How time still broke his promise, day by day, To bring thee back to me. Oh! of the sighs I have heaved in an hour I could have found a wind, Had I the cunning to make store of them, Would cause thy ship to heel! There have I sat, From coming in to going out of light, Perch'd, like a lonely beacon, on the cliff, Watching for thee;âand if I saw a speck, I thought thee there; and, when it pass'd away, I felt the pangs of parting o'er again!â How long wilt be away? Edw. A month. Mari. Say two! I'll make my mind up to two monthsâand then, If thou return'st before the time, thou know'st It will be usury of happiness! Thou'lt stay two months!âTwo months is a long time! Edw. I tell thee but a month! Mari. I'll not believe it; For, if I should, and thou beyond shouldst stay, Each hour beyond will be another month! So, for my two months, I may pine two-score! Nay, for two months I will not look for thee! Edw. And then we marry! Mari. So my father says. Edw. O Marian, when thou'rt mine! Mari. Thou wilt not go Again to sea. Edw. No, girl!âAnother trip, We are rich enough! How love hath made us wise! When boy and girl, we talk'd as man and wife; And 'gan to hoard 'gainst days of housekeeping. Our first small ventureâwhat a heap it brought! Its value more than ten times doubled! 'Twas That Heaven did bless it!âMarian, that's the luck! And since that lucky day, whate'er we've tried Has thriven with us still. Mari. Thank Heaven, it has. Edw. Ay!âAnd the saint who taught me, on her knee, âNo life so happy as an honest one!ââ Thy mother!âThy dear mother, Marian.â Mari. She loved thee! Edw. Yes!âWhat were a wrecker's gains Compared to ours? To think that they're our own! None to dispute them with us!âNo, not e'en A dead man's bones! I have kept my watch, on deck, In a gale, the billows higher than our cliffs; That, looking from their tops, you wonder'd how The vessel could go down, and rise again; While, as she heel'd until her yard-arms duck'd. You thought each moment shrowd and brace would crack, And every mast at once go overboard!â Thus have I kept my watch; and then I've found The best of treasures was a conscience, clear! And with my venture in my chest below, Would not have changed that slanting, creaking deck, To take the wrecker's station on the shore, With wind and wave at work, and breaking up A fast and rich galleon! Marian, Why dost thou hang thy head? Mari. My father is A wrecker. Edw. So was mine, my Marian. What then? We're not the children of their trade! Pass but another monthâWell, I'll say twoâ And change of state shall bring us change of scene! We'll quit these haunts, and ply some inland calling! Why turn'st thou pale, my girl? What frightens thee? I only see Black NorrisâFear'st thou him? Mari. Yes!âNo!âI fear, yet know not cause to fearâ No just cause!âYetâThank Heaven he's gone again! Edw. He dared offend thee once, but paid the forfeit; And durst not offer wrong to thee again! Hast other cause to fear him, Marian? Mari. When last you were at sea, the weary nights Thy mother and thy Marian beguiled, As ever in thy absence they were wont, With talk of thee; and growing sad with that, Old tales of marvel, from her ample store, The kindly dame would tellâPeace to her spirit!â I shall not have her now to comfort me! Edw. Don't speak of that! Go on. Mari. One dreary night, A wrecker was the storyâbanish'd son, And worse than banish'd father! that watching was A vessel fast upon the Goodwin Sandsâ Edw. I know!âThe body of a man was wash'd Ashore. The wrecker fell to rifling it, But life was in the body. Mari. That's the tale. The wrecker heard him groanâso, conscience-wrung, The wretch confess'dâand to secure his prey, Destroy'd what Heaven had bade the tempest spare; Stopp'd with his hands the holy breath of life, And watching, for assurance that the work Of foulest sin was done, by the wild glare Of the lightning, which, that moment, rent the clouds, And lighted up the ghastly scene of blood, Beheld the feature of his banish'd boy, On his own beach, by his own father murder'd. Edw. But what hath this to do with him, the sight Of whom recall'd the tale? Mari. His father is A convict, serving in a distant land. His term of shame, almost expired; for crime Done on the storm-strewn shore. Edw. I know he is. Mari. I mused on them, as by thy mother's hearth I sat; which soon, methought, began to spread Into our bayâa furious tempest on,â Men, women, children watching here and there, On the look-out for some unlucky barque, Its wrath might catch, and strand upon the shore! There was the lightning, and the thunder, and The rain and wind, and rattling shingles, as The billows, mountain high, came tumbling in, And there stood Norris, on that reef of his. Edw. Go on, as 'twere a real tale thou told'st, Thou fixest me, with eagerness to hear. Mari. Then came a vesselâa huge hulkâwithout A single mast left standing!âSuch a one Was wreck'd upon the coast three winters gone, When thou wast far at seaâI witness'd it. Edw. Well; but the ship you fancied? Mari. Long she heaved, And sank, and reel'd, until at last she struck Right on the wrecker's reef; where soon she went To pieces.âThen, the body of a man Was wash'd on shore, and Norris sprang upon it; But life, as in the story I had heard, Was in it still; and Norris took that life! He stabb'd the shipwreck'd manâand lo! it was His father!âIn my sleep I dream'd, that night The self-same thing. And often, since, in sleep, Ay, and in waking too, have seen't againâ Have seen the bay, the tempest, and the ship The body floating in, and Norris there, Rifling it of its lifeâthe body of His father! Strange things have been thought of him; And never look I on that scowling man, But with the thought, I see a murderer!â But thou art going, and I talk of him! I know not wherefore, but I never felt So sad before at parting! Edw. Fear'st for me? Mari. No!âThou art goodâHast trust in Heavenâimplorest Its mercy night and morn! 'Twill show it thee! Thou'lt find it 'mid the tempestânear the shoal Off the lee-shore!âor, if thy vessel strike, Or founder, surer than the sea-bird's wing, The sea-bird, it will float thee 'bove the wave, And bear thee to thy native cliff again! I have no fears for thee!âI thinkâI know Thou wilt come back to me! Thou hast no fears? Edw. None, Marian! Mari. But thou hast!âI'm sure thou hast! I see a trouble in thy face!âI do! Thou fear'st for something!âWhat is it? Edw. I would Thou hadst not told me of Black Norris. Mari. Why? See'st aught in what I told thee?âDost thou think My dream bodes ill?âthat something's sure to come? Think'st thou there's aught in dreams? Don't answer me! I don't believe there is! Edw. There is not, girl! Mari. Why wish, then, what thou didst? Edw. He gives thee pain. Mari. I will not see him again! I nothing see When thou'rt away. The sun, the earth, the seaâ All things without are goneâI have no eye, No earâexcept withinâwithin, where, only, Then, can I see and hear thee!âwhere I'm with thee At seaâashoreâand oft in hardest strait Of perilâwhere I'm always close to thee, With superhuman power to bear thee through, In spite of wildest danger! There's the gun! Edw. Farewell!â Mari. I'll see thee to the beach!âI willâ Ay, to the water's edge! That I could go Along with thee!âThe waves might rise and roar, I would not hear or see them!âCome! Edw. Nay, here We'll partâmy messmates, girl, will laugh at thee. Mari. Let them! What! lose a minuteâwith an age To come, of absenceâI, that would brave the sea To go with thee, heed those its surges toss! I'll go with thee e'en to the water's edge! And then mine eyes shall go along with thee! And when thou leavest them, and they give o'er, My thoughtsâmy heartâmy soulâwhich water, land, Air, nothing 'neath the sun can tear thee from! [They go out. SCENE III. âThe inside of Robert's Cottage. Robert seated in the centre, occupied in splicing an oar. Enter Stephenâa lad. Rob. Well, Stephen! what of the ship? Ste. She's under way With every yard of canvas spread. Rob. The wind Is fair? Ste. A point, or more, abaft the beam; A gentle breeze, and steady. Rob. So it seems. 'Twill change ere night! Ste. I see no signs of it. Rob. You do not know them when you see them, Stephen! Though a good sailor, you're a young one yet! But I'm an old acquaintance of the weather. âA point,â you say, âor more, abaft the beam?â Then is the vane north-west. Ne'er heed the vane, Look ever to the cloud, the weathercock Behoves the shipman heed, which tells what wind Will come. How steers the cloud? Ste. North-west. Rob. That's right Against the ship which now sails with the wind! Now mark my words! Ere night the wind will take Her merry sails aback, and talk to her! And bid her clew her gay topgallants up! There will be call for reefs, and work for sheets And halyards! âFore-sheet, fore-top-bowling!â Will keep throughout the night a busy watch! But she'll have sea-room, and no gull more safe Sitteth the wave than she. Here! Lend a hand. [Stephen goes to Robert and assists him. Where's Marian? Ste. I left her on the beach Following the 'parting ship with all her eyes! I call'd to herâThe sands on which she stood Had ears as much as she!âShe heard me not. I turn'd to note if she were following meâ As well expect the sea!âIt moved, but she Stood still, in plight as sad, as barque that's driven Upon a quicksand, settling fast, and sure Never to come away! Rob. Her mother's vein Is in the girl!âSo fond a wife was she, That marriage, which with most is end of love, With me was only the beginning on't!â She had been early sent to schoolâremain'd there Till she could teach where first she had been taught. You see the girl she made my Marian! She made me good, for she was goodness' self; Reclaim'd me from a wrecker, for a time; But evil habits, Stephen, like old sores, Are seldom safe from breaking out again! One night arose the cry âA ship on shore!â I had been out carousing at a weddingâ The love of my old trade came strong upon meâ Down to the beach I slew, and fell to work, Unconscious that she follow'd! Three whole hours Remain'd she standing in the pelting storm! I found her with the blood wash'd out of her, White as our cliffâcold, stiff, and motionless! My ill-got spoil I soon exchanged for her, Nor set her down till in our bed I laid herâ But Heaven well knew she was too good for me; For from that bed she never rose again! [Turns from Stephen. What of the ship?âGo to the door and see! Ste. She's hull down. Rob. Any other sail in sight? Ste. Three to the westward. Rob. Up or down channel?âwhich? Ste. Up channel do they bear. Rob. One of the three May come ashore to-night. Ste. The ship has changed Her course! Rob. The wind has changed!â'Tis right ahead! She's on the larboard tackâIs it not so? Ste. It is. Rob. It looks thick weather round the ship, Does n't it? Ste. Yes. Rob. And 'twill grow thicker! Storm Is in the air, though here 'tis sunshine still. I feel it! It will blow great guns to-night! The scud will gallop and the waves will leap! A cloud has just come o'er the sun. What kind Of cloud? Ste. A streaky one, and black and low, Stretching from east to west, and in its wake A fleet of others. Rob. To be sure!âI know it, As well as you that see it.âGet my axe, Boat-hook, and grappleâLay them here beside me. [Stephen goes out and returns with the things. A storm is coming on from the south-east, Right from the seaâfull on the shore! The ship Is lost that keeps not a good offing, for The sea, in such a wind as cometh on, Rolls in like a spring tide, and surely sweeps Into our bay the unwary barque, that hugs This iron-bound inhospitable shore! What offing keep the ships? Ste. Two miles, the first, And more. Rob. She's safe. The second? Ste. Scarce a mile. Rob. She'll have her work to do, to clear the bay? Behoves her to sail well upon a wind! Lie high! be lively in her stays! The third? Ste. Not half a mile. The first ship is about! Rob. The wind has come to her! That's the new wind I told you of!âthe wind that brings the storm! Will make the tackle sing! the bulkheads creak! Try braces, shrowds and all! The very wind For the wrecker! I could tell 't at one o'clock! Ste. The second ship is now about. Rob. She is? Ste. And bearing from the land. The third shipâ Rob. Ay? Well, what of her?âIs she about too? Ste. No, She misses stays! They ware her! Rob. Is she deep? Ste. She is. Rob. Within the head? Ste. Within the head. Rob. How far? Ste. A quarter of a mile, Rob. A wreck! Sure as she's now afloat! Ste. Here's Marian. Enter Marian, abstracted. Rob. My Marian! My child! Her thoughts are still Upon her lover's ship. How does my girl? Mari. [Coming to herself, and running to Robert.] Well, father, well!âWhat have you there? Your axe, Boat-hook, and grapple! Ah!âa storm is coming! You're for the shore again!âthe heartless shore, That spares nor ship nor shipman! Rob. Did it lighten? Ste. It did. [Robert rises and takes up his wrecker's implement Mari. Stay, father, stay! Sit down again And listen to me. Rob. [Resuming his seat.] Well? Mari. How canst thou bear To strip the seaman, whom the winds may stripâ The wavesâthe rocksâwhich know not what they do; But thou dost know, and ought'st to feel! To live Upon the plunder of the elements! The havoc of whose fury it should be Thy labour to repair! The drowning man Forgot, to get possession of the mite For which he bides the perils of the sea! And, if he sinks, is not his bubbling breathâ That calls upon the friends he leaves behindâ A testament, more strong than pen can write, To make assurance unto those he loves Of aught the billows spare? Thy boat-hook dropsâ Give me thy axe. Ste. The storm is on! It thunders! Mari. It is the voice of Heaven in anger!âcalls On men for pity to each otherâeach Alike in peril placed!âLet go thy axe! Think of the axe that's lifted now above And falling fast!âmight it not light on thee? Let go thy axe.âO the poor shipâpoor crew! That hear the thunder which the ship hears not! O their poor wives! poor children! and poor friends! That pray this hour some help may be at hand! Hear me, my father! Have not you a child? Were you at sea!âwere you within that ship! Give me your axeâand now that coil of ropeâ Your grappleâgive it me! Ste. A gun! Rob. It is The signal of distress. Mari. Thy grapple, father! Rob. I tell thee, Marian, not a soul can live In such a sea as boils within our bay. Mari. And shouldst thou therefore strip the drownÃ©d man? O! at his death-bed, by the side of which No friend can stand, there is a solitude Which makes the grave itself society!â Helplessness, in comparison with which An ordinary death is kin to life! And silence, which the bosom could fill up With thoughts more aching, sad, and desolate Than ever utter'd wailing tongues of friends Collected round the bier of one beloved!â To rifle him! purloin his little stock Of gold, or jewels, or apparel!âtake And use it as thine own!âthou!âthou! whom Heaven Permits to see the sun that's set to him; And treasure ten times dearer than the sun, Which he shall never see!âO touch it not! Or if thou touch itâdrop it, and fall down Upon thy knees, at thought of what he was, And thou, through grace, art still! Rob. Her mother's voice! Her mother's words!âHere, take the coil!âPut by My boat-hook and my axe!âMy Marian, I'll not go to the beach! Mari. [Having laid the things by.] Heaven guard his ship! Rob. Thy lover's?âFear not! She has sea-room!âShe's A bird upon the sea! Mari. I am weary, father! Rob. Go to thy bedâThou art mind and body-worn! Mari. I will! You'll mind! Rob. I will, my Marian. [Marian goes out. Ste. Another gun! Rob. And nearer than the first! She's driving in apace!âWho pass'd the door? Ste. Black Norris. Rob. He will make a mint to-night! Ste. She takes the ground!âHer masts are overboard! [Runs out. Rob. Black Norris will not spare, and why should I? The waves won't spare, and why should he or I? Chests, bales will come ashore!âcordage and spars, Hatchets will go to work!âNo one will spare, And why should I?âNot I!âI'll have my share! [Takes up the boat-hook, &amp;c. Mari. [Rushing in.] Father! Rob. My child, go in! Mari. Thou go'st not forth! Rob. I must! Mari. O father! 'tis unhallow'd work! Rob. Go thou to rest! Mari. And thou at work like that? How wouldst thou sleep if I were doing wrong? I will not let thee forth! Rob. Come from the door! Mari. Father!âwhen Heaven commands me shut the door? Rob. Command who may, I'll open it!âGive way! [Forces her from itâshe falls. Robert and Stephen go out. Mari. Father!âI'm stunn'd! He's gone! How could he go! O vice that's early planted!âHard to weed it! Plant virtue early!âGive the flower the chance You suffer to the weed!âTo hope success Where my poor mother sail'd!âHeaven pity him! Heaven pity himâand I, his child, on earth, And not attempt to save him!âFather!âFather!â [Rushes out. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âThe Vicinity of the Shore. Enter Wolf and Norris, meeting. Nor. Wolf! Wolf. Norris! Nor. For the shore? Wolf. Yes. Nor. Whence I've come. In my o'er-haste, what think you I forgot? My wrecker's gear! I left them all behind? My hatchet, boat-hook, grapple, e'en my knife! [Going. Wolf. [Stopping him.] Tarry a while! Take breath! Your knife and axe, Boat-hook and grapple, are not needed yet. 'Tis but the first of flood. Until the tide Shall lift her o'er the outer bank, she'll hold Together. Tarry here and look at her! I have heard of fine sights; ay, and seen them too! Now what's the finest sight a man can see? Nor. The finest sight?âa ship that, caught in a bay Like ours, ten miles and more from any town; A black sky, a white water, and a shore All iron-bound, and boiling round with breakers! No sight like that for me! What tonnage is she? Wolf. Four hundred and above. I know a ship, And not so large a one, you had rather were Aground than she. Nor. I know the ship you mean: She left the bay at noon. You're right! I hate That ship! I hate her for the sake of one She carries. Were my father in that ship, I'd laugh to see her drown!âOne whom they call A good young manâonly another name For a limb of the devil! No young man can be good! We are young, and know we not what we are?âGood! What should make others better?âBetter natures? There's no such thing!âAll mankind are the same; Circumstance makes the difference. Circumstance Is not the man! Had I that fair-skinn'd girl, Old Robert's daughter!âher of the dainty limb, Round swelling form, and dimpled lady-cheekâ Had I that girl for messmate, or could have, You'd see how soon I'd grow a good young man,â Though devil at the bottom, stillâas he! Wolf. You fancy her.âWhy not make up to her? Nor. I told you, now, the sight which most I love. Wouldst learn the sight which most I hate? Thou shalt. The show of good, in man or woman,âbut, In woman most.âThat's strange!âI hate the sight Of a modest woman! 'Tis an eyesore to me! I never look on one, but straight I fall To gazing on myself! and then I writhe, At thought of what I am, and what she seems; Until I seem, unto myself, a beast!â Yea, a brute beast!âand stand like one before her, Gazing, and stupid,âdumb! Wolf. 'Tis strange! Nor. It is. I have tried to court herâhave accosted her, But ever, as that lady-cheek of hers She has turn'd to me, my speech has fail'd me, and I've stood stock-still, confounded at myself; And like a chid cur, slunk at last away! Strange! that the only show of goodness should So daunt a bold man, that he dares not do The thing he dares to wish! Wolf. You mean her fair? Nor. I do! but e'en for fair ends cannot take Fair means;âas smiling, speaking pretty things, Pretty behaviour, creeping inch by inch! I'd have her at a bound! That's not the way She would be won. With opportunity I'd woo her though. Wolf. What do you mean? Nor. No matter. 'Tis said they'll marry when this trip is done. Now would old Robert take a sail, and leave The girl alone, I'd promise him, that's gone A merry wedding when his ship comes back. How goes it on in the bay? She has moved methinks Since last we look'd. Wolf. She will not clear the bank Before high water, or about it. Nor. And The storm you see holds on! A lovelier Never yet broke a stranded vessel up! And plenty on't! 'Twill last till midnight.âBlack As it can look, and right in the wind's eye! Ay, steady that!âHow slow the tide comes in, And yet the wind to help it! O'er the bank And on the rough ground, she'll not hold together The quarter of an hour! I'll be prepared. Tell them I'm coming! They'll be sure to give A wide berth to the reef! Wolf. I will. Nor. Make haste! [They go out severally. SCENE II. âThe Sea-shore. Thunder, Lightning, and Wind. Enter Marian. Mari. I cannot light on him, and not a soul I pass'd but I have question'd!âWhere is he? My brain will burst!âa horrible oppression Hangs on my heart, foreboding, sure, of ill! Like what I felt, that day my mother died! I hearâI seeâ Things that I should notâForms are flitting by me! Voices are in mine ears, as if of things That areâand yet I know are not!âEach step I fear to tumble o'er the body of Some drownÃ©d man!âThere's one!âA heap of weeds! O what wild work do fear and fancy make! Did some one cry?âWell?âWhat?âWhere are you?âNo! 'Tis nobody! What is't that still keeps up This moaning in my ears, as if of words Utter'd in agony? 'Tis not the sea! 'Tis not the wind!âI hear them both. 'Tis not The wreckers on the shore!âThey utter nought But sounds of gladness. 'Tis not the ship!âShe's out Of hearing. Am I growing mad?âWhat spot Is this I stand upon?âWhat brought me here? 'Tis here they say a girl one time went mad, Seeing a murder done!âshe was in quest Of her brother; and she saw a scuffle, and Approach'd the struggling men, just as the one Did cast the other down. Although 'twas night, She saw a knife gleam in the lifted hand Of the uppermost! She tried to callâso she said, When reason did at last returnâbut power Of utterance was gone. Thrice it descended, With a dull, griding sound;âand then, a voice, Which stabb'd her heart and brain, exclaim'dââHe's dead!â It was her brother's voice. 'Tis strange that fear Should be a thing almost as strong as death! Should shut the lips upâand deprive the limbs Of motion!âYet have I a feeling how The thing may come to pass. The girl aloneâ The men upon the groundâone 'bove the otherâ The knife in his uplifted handâit falls! I feel myself a sense of choking; and My feet do seem to cleave unto the ground. My tongue doth stiffen!âHa!â[Shrieks.]âI have broke the spell! I'm by myself!âAnother minute,ânot The girl more mad than I!âThey are gone!âAll gone! The earth, and air, so thick awhile ago, With things that neither earth nor air do own, Are empty now! Mine ears, and eyes, take note Of nothing but what isâthe booming seaâ The yelling windâthe rattling shingles, as The waves do roll them up and down again; And back my wand'ring thoughts return, to that Which brought me 'midst their uproarâto persuade My poor, misguided father to return And from his lawless work restrain his hands. I have traversed all the westward shore in vain, I'll search the eastward now. [Starts again at the same heap of weeds. Not yet myself!â 'Tis the same heap of weeds I saw before! [Goes out. SCENE III. âAnother Part of the Shore. Enter Robert, followed by Norris. Nor. Old Robert!âHoa!âStop!âArt afraid of me? Rob. I never fear'd a man. Nor. Why shun me then? Rob. I like thee not. Nor. âTwo of a trade!â Is't so? Well! I'm the luckiest wrecker of you all. I cannot help it! Fortune bear the blame! That has her favourites, as all men know She has long made one of me! Is it right to hate A man for his good luck? Rob. It isn't that. Nor. It isn't that!âWhat else?âWhat can you say Against me else? A splinter'd spar the waves Do throw to youâa lockfast chest to me! To me the breakers slue the captain in; Mateâpassenger from the Indies, West or East. A foremast man to youâyou know 'tis so, And like the rest, do bear me envy; most Unlike a man! But fortune ever turns The evil you do wish me, into good. I have no partner in my gainsâwhat comes To hand is all my own! âAfraid of me!â I said it but in sport. I know you're not Afraid of me, or any other man, Or anything!âHave I not seen you leap Into a boiling sea, to save a wretch When his boat founder'd! 'Twas a feat I doubt If any other of the craft would do! Wilt go, or tarry? Nay, there's time enough; She holds together yet. There's lots of time. What speed didst come when drove the last on shore? Rob. Some coils of cordage; and a spar or two. Nor. What then did fortune, think you, throw to me? Rob. I cannot tell. Nor. One hundred guineas, all But one, lapp'd here and there, in various coin, In the heavy vest and trowsers of a manâ I mean, a bodyâthat was wash'd ashore. Here's one of them. Rob. A broad doubloon. Nor. How much Brought you your spars and cordage? How I laugh'd To see you, heavy laden, toiling home With a few crowns' worth, and I going light With a good hundred guineas, all but one! And you don't like me!âWhy?âI'm a rough man; And low'ring as they say!âbut has all fruit A fair outside? How ill-favour'd a one A walnut hasâa chestnutâcocoa-nut! And yet how sweet within!âYea there is milk Within the cocoa-nut!âYou never know Some men by their outsides!âProve them, and then You'll know them. Here's another piece more broad, And heavy than the first. Know you the coin? Rob. No!âit is strange to me. Nor. Examine it. There's something now that I would be about; Yet know not what it is!âNe'er heed! The devil Will prompt me when 'tis time! [Aside. Rob. I cannot tell The coin. Nor. Here; take a look at this. Rob. Another! Nor. Ay!âWill you believe me now? Rob. Black Norris, you're A lucky man! Nor. âBlack Norris!â Well!âit is My nick-name. You may give it meâmore black May go by fairer name! Rob. I meant no harm. Nor. I know you didn't'!âThere's none! I tell you whatâ There's not a man of all the crew, but one, I do not hate. The best were first to peach, When my old father, seven long years ago, Did something which he could not do by law; And was transported, for the lack of learning. He didn't know 'twas wrong!âWell, as I said, I hate them all, but one! and which is he?â YourselfâI say no more!âBelieve it, or Believe it not! Rob. Nay, rather I'd believe it. I never thought before, you were so frank. Nor. How could you think?âGrew samphire on yon cliff, Who'd know't, if no one went to seek it there? You keep aloof, andâstrange!âyou know me not! You, none of you, consort with me, except Young Wolf, another hang-dog, as they say. He's a wrong'd man, and so am Iâwe are friends; For common wrongs make friends of those that share them. Rob. 'Tis natural. Nor. 'Tis right!âas common fortunes, So likewise doth a common vein, make friends, My greatest enemy allows me brave! I cared for thee no more than I did care For any other of the churlish set; But, when I saw thee venture thy own life, With ten to one against thee, for that man, I took a liking to thee!âThat, you may Believe, or not, as well as the other. Rob. Nay, But I believe it. Nor. You can do no good To me!âI have nothing to get by you! Rob. Nothing! Nor. Have I not? What a silly adage that About old birds and chaff! [Aside. Rob. Hereâhere's thy gold. Nor. Nay, keep it, an thou wilt. Rob. Not so, good Norris. Nor. A rare bird I, to turn from black to white! [Aside. Why, I believe you're right; 'Tis doubtful gain, To keep a thing that's not one's own! The ship Is now on the rough ground!âHow fair she lies!â Her broadside to the sea, that not a wave But tells upon her!âWhat a cloud of surf Keeps flying over her!âLook!âThere's a sea! 'Twill take her right a-midshipsâHurra!âHurra!â She has parted in the waist!âOld Robert, where The use of words, when man can talk by deeds! Yon reef you know is mineâthey call it mine, Because I make it mineâSo far it runs Into the bay, it makes a kind of eddy, Whose swirl doth sweep all kinds of lumber in That come within its reachâas prove my gains; 'Tis thine to-day! Go try thy luck upon it. I'll help thee, if thou need'stâbut not to touch A stiver, though ten bodies should float in, With pockets cramm'd with gold. There's something! haste! The waves do snatch as readily as give. The tide is on the turnâthe shore doth shelve A foot in every nine! Rob. I thank thee, Norris. Nor. Off to the reefâHave cause, and thank me then! [Robert goes out hastily. It is a body that is wash'd ashore! I'd know it at twice the distance. A fine torch The lightning! Rain will never put it out! A body!âI begin to see it now. Yes, it is done! Wolf. [Entering.] Well, Norris! Nor. All is well. Run to the nearest group of wreckers,âsay You saw old Robert stooping o'er a bodyâ That you suspect foul playâand bring them to The reef. He's thereâbut holdânot quite so fast; Let me have time to join him.âGo!âdon't say That I am there. Now, pretty Marian, [Wolf goes out. Sure as thy lover is this hour at sea, Thy father takes a trip, and follows him. Bide there my tackle! I had best go bare! [Puts his boat-hook, &amp;c., behind a rock, and goes out. SCENE IV. The Shore close to the Sea. Enter Robert, dragging in a body.âMarian in the distance, slowly coming down a path cut out of the cliffâNorris behind a rock, from which he looks, occasionally. Rob. The surge won't reach thee there! I warrant me No fear thou'lt go to it. Thy lastâlast draught, In this world, hath it given theeâa cold, Unwelcome one! Safe bide thou there! The waves Are in a giving mood! I'd be at hand To profit by their bounty. I did think Some one was near me! Fancy!âHow it lightens! [Goes out. Enter Marian. Mari. The storm distracts me with its din! This roar, This never-ending roar, which round and round, The heavens keep up!âin which the surges join, As though the thunder were not loud enough! No sign, yet, of my father! What with fears For him, and terror of the tempest, I'm Bewilder'd! Let me try and look, above, Beyond the cloudsâbeyond the stars! No storm Is there! no wreck!âno raging sea!âno thunder! But calm, and warmth, and brightness, as befits The dwellings of the blest!âMy mother's there! O, my poor father! Here's the storm again! Sea, thunder, lightningâall come back again! Re-enter Robert. Rob. I have lost my knife! Methinks I dropp'd it here! [Sees Marian. What's that!âIs it a mortal thing? It makes My spirit faint within me!â'Tis the form Of my lost Marian!âEven so she stood In the storm wherein her life was cast away! Can she not lie in her grave for me?âDo my sins Break on her last rest, there, and call her thence? I sent her thitherâon such nights as this I have often look'd about me with a thought That she was near me. There at last she is! It is my Marian risen from her grave! She comes to me!âO powers of grace, preserve me! [Kneels. Mari. The strength of Heaven!âTo see it, yet not feel it! Within its reach to do what it forbids! And it in anger!âsee the weapons of Its wrath in motionâfeel the earth shake at them! And never pay it awe!âstand up to it! Defy it!â'stead of falling on one's knees, And asking it for mercy. Rob. Mercy. Mari. Ha! My father! Rob. Marian! Mari. On thy knees!âThat's rightâ Fear not! Thou dost Heaven's bidding!âDo not rise Until thou risest with its blessÃ©d pardon! Rob. [Rising.] What brought thee here, my child? Thou ne'er before Cam'st after me. Mari. I came to look for thee; And to persuade thee to come home with me. Thou tremblestâThou art paleâas livid as The lightning! Dost thou hear? 'Tis everywhere! Not the clouds only, but the very airâ The very seaâthe very earthâdo thunder! Allâall is din and fire! It is right For man to tremble! Rob. 'Tis not that! Mari. What then? Rob. I took thee for thy mother, Marian! Mari. Think me her still, and what she'd have thee do, Do, by the love thou bearest to her, still! Forswear this lawless life!âThou wouldst not rob A living man!â'Tis manlier to strip The living, than the dead! Rob. This night 's the last! Mari. This night!âO, no!âThe last night be the last! Who makes his mind up that a thing is wrong, Yet says he'll do that thing for the last time, Commences but anew a course of sin, Of which that last sin is the leading one, Which many another, and a worse, will follow! At once begin! How many, at this hour, Alive as thou art, will not live to see To-morrow's light!âIf thou shouldst be cut off! Should thy last sin be done, on thy last night! Should Heaven avenge itself on that last sin Thou dost repentingly!âmy father, come!â O! a bad conscience, and a sudden death! Come home!âCome home!âCome home! Rob. I'll follow thee. I'll fetch my boat-hook, and my other gear, And follow thee. Mari. I'll loiter till you come. I'll rest upon yon rock, and wait for thee; For what with cares for thee, and terror of The storm, I'm almost sped! Enter Norris, cautiously. Nor. Now is the time!âNow! while her back's to me. Is he dead? There's warmth, methinks, about the heart, More than there should be! 'Tis no matter!âCowards May stick at trifles!âCan I find a stone To knock him on the head?âWhat's this?âA knife! 'Tis Robert's! Mari. [Re-appearing and ascending the cliff.] What's that you are doing, father? Nor. She takes me for her father!âGood! She'll see What I do, and think it is her father does it, And when 'tis done, so will I slink away, She can't discover her mistake!âNow for it! [He plunges the knife into the bodyâMarian utters a faint shriek, and falls senseless. She saw it! Marian 's in my power! She's mine! What next?âQuick work, and sure!âWhen he returns, His daughter out of sight, he'll search the corpse; Discover'd in the act, the nail is clinch'd! But other witnesses are needed.âI Were better out of sight. Wolf is at hand, Nor yet alone. I'll speed to him and give him His cue, and he and they will soon be here. [Goes out. Rob. [Re-entering.] To leave it there! And the last time! Where's Marian?âOut of sight! The pockets may be full!âWhy did I quit them Unsearch'd, in greediness for other prey?â Not now too late! I'm all alone!âA minute Will serve to rifle them! I were a fool To leave to others, what of right is mine! [Goes to the body, and empties one pocket. What have we here? Some of the bright broad pieces Black Norris show'd me! What a madness 'twere To leave them in the pockets of the dead, And let the living go with empty ones! I'll count them by-and-by!âAnd this is full! [Empties the other pocket. I'll ease it of its burthen!âGold! All gold! Whence comes that glare? Ha!â'Tis the beacon struck By the lightning, and on fire! Enter suddenly Wolf, Ambrose, and others; led by Norris. Amb. What do you there, Old Robert? Rob. Nothing that I fear to do. Amb. What hold you in your hand? Rob. Gold! Amb. Gold? Rob. Ay, gold! Wolf. Let's look at the body!âHa!âWhat's hereâA knife? Rob. My knife! Amb. Your knife? Why, Robert, it is sticking In the dead man's breast! Wolf. Pull out the knife! Amb. 'Tis Robert's knife!âHow came this, Robert? See;âhe cannot speak! Phil. [Descending the cliff.] What's here?âA woman!âIs she dead? [Lifts Marian. 'Tis Marian! She breathes! She's stunn'd; that's all! 'Tis well the ledge Preserved her from the bottom! She must needs Have miss'd her footing. Wolf. Swoon'd, as likely, at The sight of what her father did. [Marian, recovering consciousness, descends, supported by Philip, who brings her towards her father. Rob. [Restored to collectedness at sight of his daughter.] My Marian! Wolf. You see she swoons again. The sight of him recalls the deed of blood! Rob. My Marian! Wolf. Hold him fast! Help Norris, while he takes him to his hut; I'll help you too! Rob. My Marian! Wolf. She swoons Away again. Rob. Let me go, friends!âI'm innocent! For the love Of Heaven, don't drag me from my child! I'm innocent! Marian! My Marian! My Marian! I'm an old man, lads! Use me gently! No! Don't drag me from my child!âI'm innocent! My Marian! My Marian! My Marian! [They force Robert away, leaving Marian supported by Philip. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âThe inside of a Hut. Robert discovered pacing to and fro. Rob. A murderer!âWhatâI, that sicken at The sight of blood, to do the deed of blood! A murderer!âand with a hand as free From blood as an infant's!âTo be tried for it! Condemn'd, perhaps, and executed!âI!â That never did it!âThen my branded name, That don't deserve the brandâand, worse than all, To leave it to my childâmy Marian! My fair young girl!âgood!âgood!âwhom Heaven sent To save her father; but he would not heed herâ Turn'd a deaf ear unto an angel's lips, To listen to that devil, the greed of pelf! That was my crime, indeedâbut only that. Some one has circumvented me, but who? Black Norris? Him or Wolf I sore suspectâ But what's suspicion only?âNot a thread To bind a man with! Enter Norris. Nor. Robert! Rob. Is it you, Black Norris? Nor. Yes, 'tis IâBlack Norris, as You call meâcome to cheer you. Rob. Well, Black Norris? Nor. I don't believe you did that murder. Rob. No? Nor. Some one has got the better of youâlaid A trap for you, and caught youâwhoâHeaven knows! I say, I don't believe you guilty, but Appearances are all against youâcaught Stripping the body, with the gold in your hand, And your knife sticking in the dead man's breast!â Rob. Who stuck it there? Nor. Why, how should I tell? Rob. [Catching hold of Norris.] Nay, Who stuck it there? Nor. Not I, Nor any one I know!âTake off thy hands, Old man!âI did not come to wrestle with thee; Wish'd I a game like that, I'd tackle to With tougher sinews!âFor another end I cameâto tell thee 'tis my turn to watch, And hast thou goods to run, the coast is clearâ Now, grip me by the throat. Rob. Forgive me, Norris. Nor. Forgive thee!âFiddlesticks!âOffend me first, Then ask me to forgive thee. Here is gold For that they took away from thee.âAway! Make straight for the east coast!âTake shipping there, And where thou settlest, advertise me!âGo!â Rob. [Going, stops short.] My child! I had forgot herâSeek her! Seek And bring her to me! I can't fly from death Without my child!âI can't forsake my child! Nor. Forsake thy child!âA stranger, now, to her Availeth more than thou. What are the dead Unto the living?âNothing!âNot the worth Of a wheaten strawâThat helps to make a light! You can make nothing of the dead!âIf you thirstâ Hungerâgo nakedâsuffer anything; You may for them! There's help in a live mouse More than a dead man!âand what else art thou? Accused of that, the man that doeth which The law condemns to die. Escape the lawâ And then talk of thy Marian. Rob. No more; Thou madden'st me! Nor. I tell thee what thou know'st Must be!âAnd, sooth to say, though a rough man, I've no desire to see thee die the death! Who meets it bravest, but puts on a mask Which only proves the agony 'twould hide, When at the hangman's touch, the sweat-drop starts On the bold brow, so seeming calm; and the blood Flies to the heart, and leaves the valiant cheek, That would be thought to smile, without a drop To vouch for it! Rob. Thou harrow'st me, good Norris. Nor. Yet what I tell, thou know'st! What must it be, When a reprieve, at the last point, has kill'd! I knew a man who narrowly escaped. To think of what he told me, even now Makes me breathe thick, and from my crown to my sole Sets my flesh tingling; and all o'er my skin Spreads the chill, clammy, heavy dew of death!â What at the sight of the huge, living mass Of human faces, all upturn'd, he felt As would a living man, suppose he lay Beside a corpseâfor such, he said, he seem'd To be unto himself. How he began to freeze, To freeze at the heat of the sun, with thought of the grave! How life Stared on him, yea, from lifeless things around him! Fields, houses, walls, stonesâyea, the grisly frame He stood on, his last footing-place in the world! And he living a spectacle of death! The process thenâ Rob. Leave off!âI choke!âI fly!â The door is fast! Nor. Thy fear hath shot the bolt!â You see 'tis open! Rob. [Taking his handkerchief from his neck.] Give my Marian this, And be a friend to her! Nor. I will. Rob. My child! Nor. Soon as the seas are cross'd, what hinders her Take ship, and follow thee? Rob. Thou'lt see to that? Nor. I will. Rob. My blessing on thee, Norris! Nor. Nay!â Rob. Thou'rt the preserver of my lifeâand all That makes it life to me! As thou to me Art kind, may Heaven prove kind to thee! Thy face Why dost thou turn away? Nor. I do not like That any see me weep!âI had as lief Be hang'd as thank'd! My watch is nearly spent, A quarter of an hour; and 'tis the span In which thy coil of life doth lie. Make haste! Why dost thou stand bewilder'd thus? Look, Robert! There is the door!âA minute more 'tis lock'd! Choose on which side on't thou wilt then be found. Rob. I take thy profferâNorris! Nor. If thou breathest Another word of thanks!â Rob. I won't!âYou'll not Forget my child?âYou'll be a father to her? Swear thou wilt be a father to my child! Nor. You note my hand is on the key! Rob. Don't turn it! I am gone!âI fly!âMy Marian!âMy Marian! [Rushes out. Nor. My Marian!âAn open window. Ay! Now a fast door. Who's there? Wolf [outside]. 'Tis I. Nor. What, Wolf? Enter Wolf. Come in! He's off!âhe's fled!âArt sorry, man? I'm not much prone to pity; yet had as lief A man that's innocent should escape as die. Wolf. That's innocent! Nor. Thou fool! Hast known me still Thy master in all kinds of craftiness, Could buy and sell thee, and believest thou yet He murder'd him? Wolf. Who did it then? Nor. By my troth, Thou hast no stomach for a deed of blood! Thy own seems spill'd at only thought of one! 'Sdeath! Is't a frost, man, that thy cheek's so white, And that thou shiver'st so? âWho did it then?â No one! There's fire to warm thee! Be thyself! Wolf. The knife was taken from his breast. Nor. It was!â What ails thy teeth to make them chatter so? Want'st meat, or drink, or sleep, or what? âThe knife Was taken from his breast!â What then? The knife Found nothing there it could not find within A six weeks' buried corpse! Furies and death! Believest me not?âor takest me for a ghost, Still gazing on me thus, with mouth agape? Listen! Whilst he was gone to fetch his gear, Which he had left behind him on the reef, Soon as it served to draw the body in, I, who was all along upon the watch, Stole to the body, thereupon to leave Some mark of violence,âsuch as prates of hands, Found the wreck'd seaman, dead. [Wolf shakes his head.] I tell thee, dead! 'Sdeath! won't believe me still? Searching for something To serve my purposeâlo! my hand by chance Lit on his knife, he had dropp'dâon Robert's knife!â When didst thou get the ague? What a fit!â I say by chance I lit on Robert's knife, For which this hand of mineânot Robert's, as Thou thought'stâThou dog-fish! How I laugh at thee!â Gave it the sheath wherein thou saw'st it sticking. Why, thou wilt shake thee out of joint! What heeds A dead man's breast a knife, more than a pincushion A pin! Wolf. [Stammering.] The body! Nor. What of it? Is it tied to thee? Art in the death-grip of The drownÃ©d man? I would not think thee, Wolf, A chicken heart, yet never saw I man That look'd more like a coward! Couldst thou see Thyself and look at me! What of the body? Did it rise up, and walk, or run, or caper, Or offer thee a hand to shake, or talk, Or troll a song to thee? What did the body To make thee marvel like a man demented? Tell me, that I may play the madman too! Wolf. Pray Heaven thou go'st not mad in earnest! Nor. Man! Wolf!âHave a care!âDon't take me for a child, Because thyself art one! Thou wouldst not say That life was in the body?âIt was warm About the heart! [Aside.]âSit down, good Wolf, sit down; Recover thee a little. Tell thy tale Thy own way. For I see there's somethingâcomeâ Go onâthe body? Wolf. I return'd to it When thou and all the rest were gone, to search If yet a coin or two remain'd. 'Twas bleeding! I thought it strange, for not a drop I saw, Follow'd, when out the knife I drew; and I fancied Life must be in it stillâand so it was! I felt the heart beat slow and dullâmine own Methought would stop! Nor. Kept the blood flowing still? Wolf. It didâmore free; and as it flow'd, the heart Began more free to beat. Nor. It had been wrong To stop the blood. Wolf. I didn't!âI only watch'd The heart, the beat of which grew stronger still, Until methought the chest began to heave; And so it did!âand, presently, I heard A gurgling in the throat of the shipwreck'd man, And I began to freeze, expecting now To hear the body speak. Nor. Did it? Wolf. Almost! A sound between a murmur and a moan. Nor. Was it repeated? Wolf. Yes; but very faint. Nor. Any more? Wolf. Yes; fainter though, at every time; And now the heart beat faint, and presently Came a slight shivering o'er the bodyâthen A sighâand nothing moreâthe soul had fled! Nor. I thought 'twas over warm about the heart! Wolf. O Norris, say it not! Nor. What did I say? Wolf. You thought 'twas over warm about the heart. Nor. Well!âOf what value is a spark of life, More than a spark of any other thing? Wolf. The body was thy father's! Nor. Devil!âImp Of Hell! Unsay it, or thou diest, with A lie in thy throat! Wolf. Were it my last breath, Norris, I speak the truth! Nor. Who else has heard it from thee? Wolf. No one! Nor. I am mad!âNo wonder if I am! Wretch, hadst thou stopp'd the old man's bloodâ Wolf. He had lived! I thought thy interest 'twas, that he should die. I knew not then it was thy father. Nor. Devil! Why had I anything to say to thee! And where's the body now? Wolf. I left it where I found it. Nor. Fool!âThou shouldst have carried it To the cliff, and cast it straight into the sea, Where ne'er the sand is dry. Wolf. Would not the sea Have thrown it up again? Nor. The sea?âThe earth, Though it were buried in't ten fathom deep, Would throw it up again!âNothing can make A grave that's deep enough to keep it!âCast A mountain on't, 'twould heave it off!âThey'll know it When it is brought before the coroner! Wolf. I have taken care of that. Nor. Mangled the features? Wolf. Yes! Nor. Savage!â Wolf. For thy sake I did it! Nor. True! Right!âYou did very rightâand after all What was it but a piece of clay?âNow, Wolf, Where wouldst thou be? Wolf. Why, anywhere but here! Nor. Wilt cross the sea?âThou hadst a hand, thou knowest, In the murderâThou didst finish itâThou lett'st The old man dieâhe were not murder'd, elseâ Wilt cross the sea?âI'll give thee gold enough To pay thy passage wheresoe'er thou'lt go, And set thee down there, as a man,âand more, If more thou want'stâWilt cross the sea? Wolf. I will. Nor. When wilt thou start?âTo-morrow? Wolf. Yes. Nor. At dawn? Wolf. At dawn!â Nor. That's good!âThat's excellent!âI'm much Beholden to thee, WolfâThou'rt a true friendâ Go farâGo very far!âThe wider berth The better! Stop not at a thousand milesâ Or twoâor three!âLook, Wolf! I have a jar Buried in the garden, full of treasureâTake it, And luck go with you!âYou will start to-morrow? At dawn?âTake passage to a distant land, Will you not!âThank you! Thank you, Wolf! I'll ne'er Forget you!ânever cease to be your friend! [They go out. SCENE II. âThe inside of Robert's Cottage. Enter Marian. Mari. My father's house! O would it were, indeed, My father's house, as I knew it!âonce! I were content to be a wrecker's child! But now I have a feeling as I were The loathing of the roof that gave me birth! The threshold, which from childhood, out and in I have pass'dâand O how oft in blithest mood!â Seem'd as it said to me I had no right To cross it nowâmy room would shut me out! The very bed I've slept in every night For eighteen years, appear'd to say to me, âLie on the floor!ââand when in agony I threw myself upon the floor, I shrank, As that would spurn me too, and cry to me, âThou art the daughter of a murderer!ââ Me, that when household use required the life Of a poor brainless bird, would run a mile To get some other hand to take it, nor Could even then look on!âBut where is nature? She has been scared away, but now returns. O my poor father!âO my luckless father! My hapless, guilty father!âWill the day Never more break?âI only wait for it To seek for him, and comfort him, and tell him That I am still his childâhis Marian! Rob. [Rushing in.] My Marian!âWhat! Hold'st thou back from me? Mari. No. Rob. But thou dost! Mari. No!âNo!âSee thereâI have thrown My arms around thy neck! Rob. Yes!âbut you turn Your head away! Mari. Is't turn'd away now? Rob. No! But where's the kiss, you never met me but You printed on my cheek?â Mari. There! Rob. Humph!âI fear I have thrown away both time and riskâI came To seek my daughterâbut she is not here!â She has gone from me!âdeserted me!âI have lost her! Mari. No!âNo!â Rob. You know her?âfetch me her!âmake haste! Mari. She's here! Rob. She's not!âShe's anywhere but here! And I am here at peril of my life, To see her for a minute ere I go Perhaps for ever from her. Mari. Oh! my father! I am indeed thy child!âThy Marian! Rob. These tears are something like herâI begin To think that thou'rt my childâThou art my child! Thou hast heard it? Mari. Yes! Rob. What ponderous thing is âYes,â To take a sigh like that to heave it off? Mari. Thou art in danger. Rob. Great!âTo-morrow, may be, A dungeon! there, most certainly the dock!â There, in all likelihood, the gibbet! but I have a chanceâthat chance is now!â'Tis little! And, every moment that I lose, grows less! But I'm content it should go all!âay, all! If I have lost one fraction of my child That's due to meâgo allâand let it go! Mari. I am all thy ownâThy own hand not thy own More than thy Marian!âThou'rt in flight!âWe'll fly Together! Rob. [Re-assured.] No, but thou shalt follow me, And speedily!âThink kindly of Black Norris!â He set me freeâHe'll be a friend to theeâ He furnish'd me with means of flight. Mari. With means? [Marian goes out, and returns with a little purse. Here, father, here! Rob. Part of thy little store? Mari. The rest 's at sea. To have it with me, now, Though it might grow to millions where 'tis gone, I'd miss the mighty gain! Rob. And thou, my child?â Mari. I have hands!âThere's Heaven!âO father! Rob. Dost thou think Thy father guilty? Mari. I think nothing, now; Except that thou'rt in danger. Rob. Marian, I no more did the deedâ Mari. They will be here, And then thou art lost! Rob. Thou dost not think me guilty? Mari. What matter what thy Marian thinks, when death Pursues thee and thou lingerest here, and not One moment am I certain but the next It may o'ertake theeâhere!âin thy own house! That's now no shelter for theeâhere!âbefore Thy Marian's eyes, that cannot help thee!âFly! Thy life perhaps may pay for the next breath Thou drawest here!âThe thought distracts me!âFly! Rob. It cannot be thou think'st me guilty? Mari. Fly! Terror will take away my sensesâFly! Rob. I do begin to doubt thou think'st me guilty? Mari. O father, fly! Rob. I am innocent! Mari. 'Tis well! Rob. It is not wellâI am innocent! I'll swear it! Mari. Thou need'st not, fatherâDon't!âFly!âFly!â Rob. Byâ [Raising his hand towards heaven. Mari. Stop! [Preventing him. Rob. Thou think'st me guilty!âSpare thy kindnessâThere, Perish thy coin! I will not use it!âfly! Do anything to save my life!âIf it goes, It may go!âHere I'll sit!âE'en here!âAy here!â Here in the cottage thou wast born in, nursed, Brought up inâtill thou'rt eighteen years, and now Tell'st thine own father he's a murderer! Here I'll wait for themâLet them come and take me! Take me before thine eyes!âimprison me! Try me, and hang me! I'll not turn my hand To save my life! Since my own child, that knows me, Believes me guilty. I am guilty!âYes! Let all the world beside believe me so. Amb. [without]. What hoa! Rob. They come! Mari. Fly by the other door! [Knocking at that door. Rob. You hear? It is beset! Mari. Hide somewhere! Rob. Where? They'll search the house!âWere there a hundred doors And all were freeâwere there a cavern, where No foot could follow meâI would sit here And let them take me! Amb. Robert! Rob. [Opens the door.] Here!âCome in! [Ambrose and others enter. Mari. For mercy's sake!â Rob. For no sake!âHere I am: Take me! Mari. My father! Rob. I am guilty! Mari. Nay!â Rob. She says I amâtake me away! Mari. O! stay! Don't take him yet!âGood friends!âYou are neighbours!âDon't! Don't take away my father!âLeave him with me!â PrayâPray don't take him! Rob. I am guiltyâTake me! I am guilty!âAsk my childâmy Marian! Mari. Don't!âDon't!âStay! Mercy! Mercy!âO my father! [They go out. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âA Waiting-room. Enter Ambrose and Philip. Amb. He is committed, and I pity him! To be condemn'd upon the evidence Of his own daughter! 'Tis unnatural To take away the life that gave us ours! This comes of learning!âHad it been a child Of yours, or mine, what heed would she have taken Of a false oath, to save her father's life? Her mother was a sort of ladyâay, The daughter of a broken gentleman, Took up his quarters in the cottage, while Old Robert's father lived. They fell in love, And at the father's death, they married. Phil. So Fair Marian's lady breeding. Amb. Even so She, as her mother used before, it seems, Still quarrels with the freedom that we take With dead men's gear; and to the beach must needs Follow her fatherâShe had better far Have sought her death, for what a curse must life Be to her now! Was it not strange she fainted Soon as her evidence was done, and yet Could give that evidence! Phil. Here comes old Robert. Enter Robert between two constables, followed by men and women.âNorris in the back-ground. Rob. I am innocent! I am murder'd! My own child Has sworn my life away! My Marian! Falselyâmost falsely!âWhen they try me, 'tis By her I die; not by the judgeâthe jury, Or any one but her! She gives the verdict!â Passes the sentence!âputs my limbs in irons!â Casts me into my dungeon!âdrags me thence To the scaffold!âis my executioner! Does all that puts her father in his grave Before his time!âHer father, good to her, Whate'er he was to othersâOh! to have died By any evidence but mine own child's! Take me to prison. First Constable. We are waiting for The order of committal. Mari. [Rushing in.] O my father! Rob. Thy father?âAm I so?âI prithee, girl, Call me that name again! It is a thing Too strange to be believed! Mari. What, father? Rob. What? Why, to be father to so good a child! Mari. So good a child? Rob. So good a child! I say it Again!âSo good a child!âCome, look at me! Give me thy hand!âthe other one, and look Full in my face!âAnd fix thine eyes on mine!â As I do live, thou canst!âAnd yet canst lie To call me father!âThou'rt no child of mine! [Casts her from him, she falls on her knees. Mari. My father! Rob. Up! or I will trample on thee! Fasten my hands in thy dark silken hair, And lift thee up by it, and fling thee from me! Who gave thee those fine locks? Mari. Thou! Thou! Rob. Who gave thee Those hands thou clasp'st to me? Mari. Thou! Rob. I!âIndeed! And the rest of thy limbs?âThy body? and the tongueâ That murder'd meâOwest everything to me? Mari. I do!âindeed I do! Rob. Indeed! Indeed! Thou liest! Thou wast never child of mine! No!âNo!âI never carried thee up and down The beach in my arms, many and many a day, To strengthen thee, when thou wast sickly!âNo! I never brought thee from the market-town, Whene'er I went to it, a pocket-load Of children's gear!âNo!âNo!âI never was Your playfellow that ne'er fell out with you, Whate'er you did to him!âNo!âNever! Nor When fever came into the village, and Fix'd its fell gripe on you, I never watch'd Ten days and nights running, beside your bed, Living, I know not how, for sleep I took not, And hardly food! And since your mother diedâ Mari. Thou'lt kill me, father! Rob. Since your mother died, I have not been a mother and a father Bothâboth to thee! Mari. Oh! spare me! Rob. I was never Anything to thee!âCall me father!âwhy A father's life is wrapp'd up in his child! Was mine wrapp'd up in thee?âThou know'st 'twas not!â How durst thou call me father?âfasten upon me!â That never gave thee proof, sign, anything Of recognition that thou wast my child! Strain'd thee to my heart by the hour!âparting thy hair And smoothing it, and calling thee all things That fondness, idolizing, thinks upon To speak its yearning love!âcore of my heart! I never was a father to thee, so Don't call me father! Thou'rt no child of mine! Mari. I am!âI am!âDon't say I'm not thy child! The child to whom thou didst all this and more. Rob. Thou stood'st not then, just now, in the witness-box, Before the justice in that justice-room, And sworest my life away. Mari. Where thou dost say, I stood!âWhat thou dost say, I did!âand yet, Not in those hours thou namest of fond endearment, Felt, as I felt it then, thou wast my father! Rob. Well!âJustify itâProve thee in the rightâ Make it a lawful thingâa natural thingâ The act of a child!âa good childâa true child! An only one!âone parent in the grave, The other leftâthat other, a fond fatherâ A fond, old, doating, idolizing father! Approve it such an act, in such a child, To slay that father! Come! Mari. An oath!âan oath! Rob. Thy father's life! Mari. Thy daughter's soul! Rob. 'Twere well Thy lips had then a little of the thing The heart had over much of! Mari. What? Rob. Stone!âRock! They never should have open'd! Mari. Silence had Condemn'd thee equally. Rob. But not the breath Mine own life gave! Mari. I felt in the justice-room As if the final judgment-day were come, And not a hiding-place my heart could find To screen a thought or wish; but every one Stood naked 'fore the judge, as, now, my face Stands before you! I could not, in his presence, Deny the thing he knewâthe thing he knew, Was also known to me! I could not take, And in his face, his holy name in vain! Nor could I hold my peace; a stronger will Than mine, than yours, than all the world's, compell'd My lips to open!âI lost thought, that moment, Of everythingâfriends, lover, father, all!â I nothing saw but that all-seeing eye Bent searchingly on mineâthough now I see Nothing but my father! [She rushes towards him, and throws her arms round his neck. Rob. Hold off!âthou adder! Sting me, and think to coil about me still With thy loathsome folds! Think I will suffer thee! Not grasp thee!âpluck thee from me!âdash thee to The earth! Mari. Oh! no! Rob. Unloose thy coil!âmy flesh Creeps at the touch of thee! Let go thy hold, Or I will do some violence to thee! Mari. Do! Rob. Strike thee! Mari. Do!âDead!âDead!â'Twere merciful. Rob. No: suffer thee to live, that thou mayst see My execution. Mari. Is it thy child Thou speakest to! Rob. Let go, or I will curse thee! Mari. Do! so thou sufferest me to cling to thee. You cannot think I swore it with my will! That Iâthy childâthy Marianâall my life Good to theeâwas I not?âand loving thee!â Did I not?âO you cannot think that I, Who would suffer tortureâdeathâten thousand deaths, To save thy lifeâwould swear thy life away Willingly? willingly?âOh! in my heavy straitâ To be an instrument of justice 'gainst theeâ That makes me wishâand I do wish itâthou Hadst never given me being!âbear not thus Unsufferably hard upon thy child!â Thy child as ever! Whatsoe'er she did! Whatsoever thou hast done!âThat loves theeâdotes Upon thee! honours!âidolizes thee, As e'er did child her father! Rob. Let me go! Or sure as I'm a living murder'd manâ Murder'd by thee;âI'll curse thee!âlet me go!â Third Bailiff enters with a paper, which he gives to the First Bailiff. Third Bailiff. The order of committal! Mari. [To Bailiff.] Stop!âa minute! Rob. Or loose thy hold, or bide my curse! Mari. My mother! That is in her graveâwho gave me to theeâgave me, When she had bless'd me on her death-bed, saying, âBe mother, now, and father to our child!ââ For her sake, father! Am I not by her Enough an orphan!âwould I, think you, would I Be more an orphan than I am? Rob. Away! Mari. Bothâboth my parents lose? Rob. Mayâ Mari. [Shrieks.] Don't curse meâbut I cannot let thee go!â [They go out, Marian clinging to her father. Norris. [Coming forward.] Hold on, old Robert! That's the mood! Hold on! Rail at her! Spurn her! Curse her! Drive her mad! The more she's fit for me. Use thy own flesh Like carrion! Foot it from thee! Loathe it! I'm The bird will banquet on't!âA father's blood Must not be shedâalthough unwittinglyâ For nothing!âThat's the price which I have paid For her dark hair, white skin, and shapely limbs; Her lady face and fairly rounded form! And I will have them;ânor do I prize them less Because her heart would give them to another! That is the feast of hate, to taste the joy That's purchased at the cost of those we loathe! And, now, to end the game successfully, The close of which I pant for more and more, The nearer that it draws! She must be mine! 'Tis well I kept aloof. I risk no blame For not disclosing what I was not ask'd To tell. And what my tale? I saw old Robert Dragging the body in. Well, what comes next? I saw him leave it; and, to put a trick Upon the old man, just in sport, although I'll own 'twas somewhat devilish in me, took Occasion of his absence, found his knife, And, knowing that the man was deadâstone deadâ Stuck it, and left it where they saw it. This I'll swear, and who can contradict me? Wolf Is far away! Thus, that he lives or dies Depends on meâon Marian, the choice To save or sacrifice her father's life. One only bar remainsâher love for Edward, And that I've taken care to manageâspread Report his vessel founder'd in that storm, And he and all went down. I managed this In the village where I skulk'd. 'Twill soon be here, And then for Marian. Madden'd as she isâ Her lover fancied drown'd, her father's life In jeopardy; she's certain to consent. Then, my confession, when the prison doors Will ope to him, and Marian's arms to me! Enter Stephen. Whither so fast, good Stephen? Ste. Where is my master? Nor. Fast in prison! Ste. Where His daughter? Nor. Thou hast news,âand it is bad! Ste. It is!âYoung Edward's ship is cast away Upon the coast of France, and all the crew, 'Tis said, have perish'd! Nor. Know'st thou what thou say'st? Ste. As thou that hear'st me say it! Nor. All the crew? Ste. All! Nor. And thou art in search of Marian To tell her this? Ste. I am! Nor. I'll bring thee to her. Stephen, I wonder at thy news!âThe news Which I myself have spread! [Aside.] I'll bring thee to her. [They go out. SCENE II. âThe Outside of a Prison. Marian before the gate, half-reclining on the ground. Mari. Here is my death-bed. Here I'll stretch myself And die! I feel it! I am sure I am about to die. I could have borne The shame of the misdeed that was not mineâ Submitted to it, as the will of Heaven, Incurring which I had not broke its willâ But that the tie of nature should have snapp'd Along with that of reverence for Heavenâ That where I found all loveâall safeguard, onceâ I find all loathingâall desertion now!â That is too hard to bear! No kind of shame That ever made the cheek to redden, while The heart was free, had made me shrink from himâ I would have cleaved to him amid the lightnings Of blasting looks, and voices, thundering scorns!â Shared the dark penance of his dungeon with him! Walk'd with him to the place of execution! Mounted it, step by step, along with him! And, all around him lowering, shone upon him Till his last look, with reverence and love! They shall not shut me from his prison!âHave No right! I am his child! They should not heed His anger 'gainst me which they do not share, But I must bear alone! How high soe'er The surf doth run! They shall not keep me out! Within! within!âWho minds the gate? Enter Jailer. Jailer. What want you? Mari. Admittance to my father! Jailer. 'Tis forbid! Mari. Open the door a little.âDo, good sir, And let me speak with youâgive me but a chink, I'll pass through it! [Aside.] [Jailer opens the gate, she tries to pass it, but is prevented. They advance struggling. Jailer. What mean you? Are you mad? Mari. I am! The fury all, without the trance That makes it bearable! The horror of The dream, without the sleep! Do you know aught About the ties of nature? Have you look'd Upon a living father, mother, brother, Or sisterâor upon a living child That was your own? I have a living father, And he's within that prisonâand I am here His living child, and yearn to go to him! And you say I cannot! Can you say it? Will you? Do you? You do not! Cannot! Will not! Oh, Admit me to my father! Jailer. What's the use? He'll only drive thee from him! Mari. Let me in, I'll find the use! Oh! do you think his heart Could turn to stone, in a moment? Harden so To the very core, and 'gainst his only child? Admit me, and you'll see it still is flesh; All fleshâall beating flesh, and at the core, Its inmostâtenderestâwarmest partâhis child! Jailer. Poor girl! Mari. You pity me!âOh! show me pity thenâ The act it prompts!âwithout which, spite of all Its melting looks and tones, its sighs and tears, 'Tis useless as a very beggar, who Gives all things but the needed thingârelief! You say âPoor girl!ââand you say true! To be An orphan!âto be friendless!âshelterless! To go in rags, and they in tatters! Hang From morn till mornâfrom week's end unto week's end, 'Twixt sustenance and starvation!âall of these, Together, but a little sprinkling make Of suffering, to the torrent hurl'd on me! I can't stand under it much longer.âNow! My reason totters!âreels! Another moment I'm a lunaticâO save me from the jacket, The strawâthe whipâthe chainâopen the door! Admit me to my father! Jailer. It is hard To have no option but the act of duty, When the heart bleeds, and duty fain must let it. Poor girl! Though I consort with stone and iron, My heart partakes not, so, of their condition, That I can see and hear thee with such eyes And ears, as walls and bars on misery turn! Thou must endureâand Heaven support thee under it! All are denied admittance to his cell, And thou, I grieve to say it, chief of all! [Going. Mari. [Stopping him.] Stay! Let me stop at the door of his cell!âat the end Of the passage that leads to it!âin the court on which The passage opens!âon the stairs!âanywhere Within the prison!âso that I may be Under one roof with him! Let me stop with you At the gate! Jailer. It may not be. Mari. Show me the window of His cell!âIs it that?âor that?âwhich is it? Jailer. Neither. Mari. Is it that then? Jailer. 'Tis not in this quarter of The prison. Mari. Which quarter, then? Jailer. I may not tell thee. Don't stop me, girl! I can't stay longer with thee! Thou quite unmann'st me! Mari. Leave the door ajarâ A moment! Let me look into the prison! [He shuts the door. Go!âThou dost weep indeed!âbut 'tis pretence. Thou art no better than the grating bolt That at thy will is shot, and holds the door! I am helplessâhopeless!âWould I were the bolt, Doorâwallsâbarsâanything but what I am! And I have put him there;âand if he dies, I hang him! Who are these that look at me, As they would strike me dead? I couldn't help it! My mother train'd me in the fear of God! I was forced to do it! Just as well might ye blame A rock to split, when riven by the lightning, As my lips to part, when in the name of Heaven The justice bade them ope and speak the truth! I am innocent!âdon't spurn meâI am innocent! [Retreats to the wall, and supports herself against it. Enter Norris and Stephen. Nor. There!âUp to her!âAccost her!âTell your news! What! is it loathing that I feel for her, Not love? It pleasures me to see her thus! Except for her I had not done it! That Is rankling at my heartâsets it in storm! I'm all for havoc! He should dieâbut then It were another murder on my soul! And I should lose the prize I've paid so much for! Ste. Marian! Mari. Well, Stephen! What of misery more? For sure it is your errand, by your looks! Tell me! You can add nothing to the cup Already that o'erflows! Is it of Edward? Is he dead? Ste. He is! Drown'd on the coast of France. Mari. I hear itâand I do not shed a tear! Nor feel the want to weep! I welcome it! 'Tis good news! He has left a world of woe To himâto himâfor what is woe to me, Were woe to him! Would I a heart I love, As I love his, should feel the blight mine feels? Would I put adders where I could not bear To have an insect sting? 'Tis well he's dead! The friends he leaves, should put on holiday, Not mourning clothes for him! His passing bell Should ring a peal, and not a knell! 'Tis best It is as it is. His welcome home had been âHeaven help you!âânot âHeaven bless you!ââWell, he's dead! How was he drown'd? Ste. His ship, they say, went down With all the crew. Mari. With all the crew! He lies In a watery grave! How fresh he look'd the day He went! What hope was in his eye, whose fire You would have thought would ne'er go out? He seem'd In speed to meet good fortune as a friend Already come in sight!âI see him now Stepping with gallant air into the boat, And looking at the sea, as 'twere a thing Stable as the solid earth!âMy sailor lad! Young, comely, manly, good, and fond of me! I little thought the look would be my last Which promised I should see thee soon again. Thou diest in good timeâ'Tis years of woes Saved by a minute's pang! I thought just now I was past weeping! I did love him!âlove him With all my will!âno portion of my heart But what was given to himâno portion on't I ever wish'd were back! Nor. Now is my time! Marian! Mari. What! more?âIs there more misery? There's nothing left but deathâI do not count Death misery! Nor. I come to talk to thee Of life, not death! Mari. Where is it?âshow it me! Life is the opposite of deathâa thing To be preferr'd to it!âshow me that life!â For if thou mean'st such life as now I see, I had rather die than live! Nor. I love thee, Marian! Mari. Does any one love Marian? Nor. I repeat I love thee, Marian, wilt thou marry me? Mari. Marry thee?âYes; when they put on for me My wedding clothesâmy shroud!âand lay me in My bridal bedâmy grave!âThen I'll be wife To thee or any one! Nor. What wouldst thou do To save thy father's life? Mari. Anything! Nor. What To have it proved that he is innocent? Mari. Anything!âpay the felon's penalty Myself!âAbide the gibbet!âMarry thee Now!ânow!âIf now thou couldst heave off for me That mountain on my heartâmy father's plight! That, heavier on my soulâmy father's sin! This didst thou doâand stood my lover there, Of whom to say, that, in his grave, he's dearer Than he was, ever, when in life to me, Is to say truthâI'd give to thee my hand! Nor. I take it!â What! draw'st thou back? Mari. 'Tis but to pause a moment! No!âI'll see nothing but my father!âThink There's no one else in the world!âI'll see but him And the plight he lies in!âdeeperâlonelier Than shipman at the bottom of the sea! Canst thou do this thou sayest? Nor. Yes! Mari. Thou'lt save My father's life? Thou'lt prove him innocent? Nor. I will! Mari. The day thou dost it, I am thine! Nor. Give me thy hand upon it!âDraw'st thy hand back Again! Mari. No!âThere!âOne moment!âEdward!âThere! [Faints in his arms. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âThe Shore. Enter Norris. I stare at my good fortune! Things that seem'd To bar my wishes, help them! First the stop, Was put to Robert's flight; then his committalâ That was the most perverse; but now he's free. My frank confession oped the dungeon-door, At cost alone of smart reproof to me, For what his worship call'd a wicked trick. And now fair Marian, with her own consent, Is mine! This very day we go to church! I would it were to any other place! I dream'd of her last night. I thought it was Our wedding day, and, to the church-door, I Was leading her. 'Twas shut! I knock'd at it. One answer'd from within, âI must not enter!â Whereat I shudder'd, for I knew the voice. And yet again I knock'd. When oped the door, And, fear-congealing sight! a spectre glared Upon me! 'Twas my father!âand he said, âIt is forbidâthou must not enter here!â I woke. It was the first night I had sleptâ To call it sleepâsince that unlucky night. Oh! may I never sleep such sleep again! [Goes out. SCENE II. âRobert's Cottage. Enter Robert. Rob. Better I had died! My child has given her life To cherish mine! E'en while I look at her, I see her wasting!âand what aggravates The pang to watch her fall a prey to death So fast, is the sweet uncomplaining patience With which she bears the tooth that's gnawing her, Working its way into the quick! She looks On me the cause of the inextricable, Unsufferable strait she has fallen into, As one to pity rather than to blame! This is her wedding day!âfar better call'd Her funeral day! I have left no means untried To tempt him to forego his claimâhe cries âI've paid the price, and what I've bought I'll take!â While prayers awaken wrath, and not remorse, And his eye lowers till I think I see His heart laid bare, with evil at the core. The hour!âI must awaken her. Her eyes Were closed when last I look'd!âbefore the time I would not have them open on the day They'll see at last too soon!âshe has waked of herself! Is up, and dress'd, and smiling with a cheek More kin to death than life!âMy Marian! Mari. [Having entered.] My father!âwhat's the matter that you turn Your eyes away? You falter when you speak! Father! be cheerfulâhappyâlook upon me! Rob. My girl, don't smile! Mari. What my face does, my father, My heart does!âIt is calm!âYea, cheerful!ânot That it lacks cause for griefâbut has more cause For gladness! I have done what Heaven approvesâ My duty!âsacrificed a little thingâ Much in itself, but in comparison Littleâto gain a great thingâto preserve My father's life!âI should smile!âLet me smile, And smile along with me! Rob. My childâmy childâ That talk'd to me like an angel!âclung to me! Knelt to me to persuade me to forbear! And, like a fiend, I would not heed, but did The evil thing, whence all this ruin grew! My child, who loving me, as she truly said, And since has proved, beyond her lifeâpreserved Her reverence for Heaven, when, lacking that, She might have saved me!âMy poor child, that I For doing so her duty, as she ought, Thrust from meâused with violenceâyea, suffer'd To trail along the street, hanging to me!â Whom I was nigh to curse!âI did not, Marian! Indeed I did not curse thee!âA child so used!â To blast her happinessâlifeâeverything, For meâand do it with a smile! Mari. My father! No more of this, beseech theeâThese are thoughts That cannot profit us! and they awaken Others, 'twere better for our peace we suffer'd To sleep!âfor they may madden!âGive me thy hand! Don't speak!âMy brain reel'd round just now!â 'Tis over!âFather, go to the door and see If he be coming. Rob. Who? Mari. The bridegroom, father. Since we're to marry, as well marry now As any other timeâO save me!âHide me!â [Rushing to her father, hides her face in his breast. Enter Edward. Edw. My Marian!âMy girl!âMy love!âMy bride! And is thy joy to see me back so great It overcomes thee?âMarian, from the hour We hoisted sail to bring me back to thee, The wind has never veer'd nor flagg'd.âWe've had A merry run of good twelve knots an hour!â Nothingâsheet, halyardâbut the helm to 'tend to, As though the vessel with my heart were racing, That kept before it still!âO turn to me!â Look at me!âSpeak to me!âThe face and voice, I have heard and seen a thousand miles awayâ Now that I'm near theeâwithin reach of theeâ Touching thee, Marian!âlet me see and hear! Has she not power to speak or move? Rob. My boy,â The sight of thee, so sudden, overcomes her. Edw. And does she love me better?âMarian!â Sweetâconstantâfondâcould I believe so fond?â 'Twas never thus with thee before at meeting! Unloose the hands that clasp thy father's neckâ Or let me do it for theeâtill I fold thee To my fond, faithfulâmy adoring heart, That yearns to feel thee near it!âMarian! Know'st thou not Edward's hand?âDoes she resist me? Is it not joy that works upon her so? Does my return give pain?âIs it a thing Unwelcome?âAm I loved no longer by her? Am I forgotten?â Mari. Edwardâno!âno!âno! Thou'rt not forgotten. Edw. No?ânor loved no longer? Mari. Nor loved no longer?âloved more dear than ever!â Than ever, Edward! Edw. Marian! My love! My life!âthe ship is on her course again! Steady! There's nought ahead!âFool that I was To fancy breakers!âCome, my faithful girl! Sit on my knee and talk to me! 'Tis long Since we have talk'd together, Marian! Dost thou hold off? I have been so long away, You are ashamed to sit upon my knee. Well! There! What you like I like? Though you've sat Often upon my knee. Well! I have made My luckiest voyage!âour pence have grown to pounds! Mari. We heard that you were shipwreck'd! Edw. Ay! Mari. Were drown'd! Edw. You took me for my ghost!âno wonder, girl, You ran away from me! O now I see! We've not touch'd ground we did not wish to touch!â Nor shipp'd a sea since first we hoisted sail! And now we marry, Marian!âWhat's the matter? How ill you look?âWhat's this?âYou shrink from me! Has she been ailing, father?âWhere are her eyes?â I left her with a rose upon her cheek, Where is it?âThat is not the form I clasp'd A month ago!âWhat's fallen? Something! Ay! Something! What is it?âBoth are silent!âThen Something I know has fallen! To look at you Is enoughâenough!â'twill drive me mad!âI am mad! Tell me the truth!âNay then I'll seek for it Where I'm more like to find it. Mari. Stop! Come back!â No!âStay!âForgive me, Edward! [Falling on her knees. Edw. Marian! Forgive thee!âWhy? For what? Mari. Don't ask!âTo sea! On shipboard, and set sail, whate'er the wind,â Anything, Edward, but the shore!âTo sea!â Rocks, breakers, sands, are nothing!âall the perils Of leaks, dismasting, canvas blown to threads, Are nothing!âFoundering!âThe dismall'st plight, That ever barque was in, are nothing!âYea Drowning, with thoughts of going deeper down Than ever plummet sounded, or of graves Made of the throats of sea-monsters, that dog The fated vessel!âLeap into them sooner Than trust thy feet on land!âTo sea!âto sea! Edw. What mean you? Mari. I will tell while I can! Edw. Rise up then, and don't kneel to me! Mari. Forgive me! Edw. For what? Mari. Ay, that's the thing, you can't forgive me Until you know for what, and when you know it, Will you forgive me then?âYou will not! Yet, Were it my last breath that I speak with to thee, I love thee dear as ever!âdearer!âdearer! I love thee dearer than I ever did!â Edw. Then where's the harm? Mari. Where?âeverywhere!âThe sun Has turn'd to ice!âThere is a haze in the sky, Chilly and thick, that ne'er will clear away! The earth is wither'd grass, leaves, flowers, and all! Women and men are changed, all cheer and comfort Departed from their faces and their tongues, To me!âfor thou that madest all these to me Art lost!â Edw. Am I not faithful to thee still? Mari. Thou art, and I am faithful still to thee! But!â Edw. What? Mari. Oh, father! Rob. Well thou mayst reproach me! Mari. No!âno! I don't reproach thee; tell it himâ Stop! he will know it soon enoughâHe's here! Enter Norris and others, dressed as for a Wedding. Nor. Marian!âWhat! Edward living!âEdward here! Edw. It dawns upon me! Dawns?â'Tis open day!â A stormy one, the sky all black, the sea All foam, all things portending shipwreck! shipwreck Already come! binnacle wash'd away! Rudder unshipp'd! not a mast standing! nothing But the hull! the lonesome, melancholy hull! With mountains breaking over it!âShe's changed! She's false! she's lost! I live, and she is lost! Nor. Come! Edw. Will she go to him before my face? She will!âShe does!âWill she go forth with him? Go forth with him to church, and leave me here? She's gone!âCome death! Well! I'm ashore againâ That which I long'd for every hour in the day! Every minute!âPray'd for! dreamt upon! lived upon!â More than on food or drink, with hope to get it, I have got at last!âI am on shore again! Better be at the bottom of the sea! What's to be done?âCan anything be done?â My destiny 's too hard to bear, and yet I must bear it!âTo be mad! O to be mad!â How can my senses stand it?âWhat are they made of? Why don't they go to pieces?âNot one plank Holding by another! All toss'd here and there In splinters!âSplinters!âCome, there's comfort in The knowledge of the cause that wreck'd the ship. That I will force from her, and then I'll leave herâ Leave everything!âLeave her, leave everything! [Goes out. SCENE THE LAST. âThe outside of a Church. Enter Clergyman, Norris, Marian, Robert, and others. Clergyman. These nuptials are not things of lucky omen. Nor. I pay no heed to omens! Clergyman. Marriage is A holidayâa day of gladness, though We drop a tear in't!âBright looks are its favours! Lightness of gait, and ease of carriage, are Its proper dress!âThis maid has none of them! Nor. She weds of her free will Clergyman. You are the bridegroom? Nor. There stands her fatherâquestion him! Clergyman. Methinks You look not like a bridegroom; no, nor speak! There's sullenness upon your brow and tongue, Care at the heart's core, if not something worse! His marriage-day is still the merriest A lover keeps. It is his harvest-home, When blights, and winds, and autumn floods are 'scaped, And all the venture of his tillage housed With song and dance and thankful merry-making. 'Tis strange! but it is your affair, not mine. You are her father!âGives the maid her hand Of her free will? Rob. She does; against her choice, She gives her hand, although it breaks her heart! Your Reverence must have heard, he holds her promise His price for service render'd unto me, By which her hand she gives, disjoining it From her heart, long given to another. Tears, Entreaties, prayers, all means I have tried, to shake His stubborn purposes, and to pity bend himâ All thrown away! Yet have resolves the strongest Given way, at last; perhaps the hour, the place, Thy sacred presence, these perhaps may give A sway to that was powerless before! Look on me, Norris! I'm a father; see To what a strait I'm brought, upon my knees Before thee in the dust! Turn to my childâ Upon her death-bed could she look more white? More ghastly, more like death? She loves thee not! To save her fatherâa father less to her Than she a child to himâshe's in the plight That brings her hither! If she marries thee, It is not with her heart! Don't take her hand! Take that, thou takest her life along with it! Thou lay'st a corpse upon thy bridal bed, And not a bride! O, spare her! spare my child! Spare me in her!âthyself! forego thy claim! Release her from the word she will not break, Though keeping it her thread of life will snap! Release her from it!âGive a young girl her life!â Preserve the remnant of an old man's life! And make thyself, if not a happy man, At least a man contented with himself; Who else, must needs become a verier wretch, Than any that he makes!â Nor. I am here to wed!â Clergyman. Stern man, look here!âthine eyes may serve the place Of ears, no need of them to learn the case Of that poor supplicant! What hast thou heard Of misery that e'er came up to that? Plead tears as strong, as she without them plead? Sighs? groans?âall things that serve as tongues to grief? She looks despair, beyond what e'er was told By doleful sound! Art thou a man, or what? What keeps thee rock, when all around thee melt? Shake! fall to pieces at the spectacle Which most ought thee to move? Hast thou no touch Of Earth or Heaven, which all men have beside? So to contrast with all? Thou livest and breathestâ By Him thou livest and breathest by, I adjure thee Forego the hand which He forbids thee take! Nor. I am the bridegroom, there's the bride; she weds Of her free will; though hearts go not with hands, No reason why they may not follow them. I love herâI will have herâand I take her! Edw. [Rushing in.] Angel! I know it all! I thought before, I could not love thee better than I did, But now I love thee more than e'er I did! Self-sacrificed to save thy father's life! The fairest barque that ever mounted wave, From duty, run upon the foulest shore! Art thou a man! [to Norris.]âO reverend sir, to proof, Without the church, let me his manhood put, And see if in my frame that fibre lives, So basely weak, 'twill yield, till at my feet His claim upon the maiden he renounce! It is not reverence to Heaven, to stand And see it outraged in the thing it loves, Through reverence to Heaven's servant or Heaven's house! Norris, come forth;â Nor. Yes! when I lead, a wife, Thy Marian from the church. Edw. She is not mine!â I do forego the maid, do thou forego Her hand! If hate for meâloathing to see The maiden mineâconstrains thee to an act To which a murder were a gentle deed, I give her up! Pluck up my hopes, although Their roots have struck to my heart's core, and cast Away that they shall never flower again, But wither, die, and rot!âOh, give her up, And take whate'er by years of toil I've made! If that sufficeth not, take me along To labour for thy gain to my life's end! To do thy bidding, whatsoe'er it be, On land or seaâhow far soe'er away! To be thy journeyman will labour through The four-and-twenty hours, without repose Or food, and set to work when they are outâ Only give up the maid, her wordâher peaceâ Her patienceâreasonâlife! Clergyman. No violence!âOr is her reason gone, Or she is in a trance! Mari. 'Tis coming!â Nor. What? Clergyman. Peace! Mari. How it scowls all around! The sea is black As the sky! From head to head as black as ink! There comes the wind! You see!âthat streak of white Along the horizon!âit grows larger!âSee!â And larger!âThat's the wind! 'Tis coming on, Pacing the waves, and stirring up the spray, As horses do the dust when they're in speed! You hear it now!âand now the sea is white As it was black before! Rob. Something like this Occurr'd last night, but I aroused her, and Recall'd her to herself. Nor. This is no time For list'ning to a dream! Clergyman. Speak'st thou again! I'll make them put thee from the church by force! I'll hear the dream out, if it be a dream! If that her senses are unsettled, you're Forbid to take her hand!âI charge you, peace! Mari. It lightens! butâ'tis distant!âAnd it thundersâ Only you cannot hear it!âfor the sea That, now, begins to roar! You'll hear it, though, Anon!â'Tis coming, listen! Hold your breathâ Don't speak! I heard a gun!âThere 'tis Again! And there's the ship, rounding the head, Rising and pitching, and no pity takes The storm upon her; but more furious waxesâ And billow after billow, fore-top high, Breaks over her! She strikes! She's fast! She's lost! And now the waves do with her what they will! She's gone to pieces!âPieces!âWhat is this? A body wash'd on shore, and Norris there, Rifling it! Ha! he stops!âHe is alarm'd! He sees that life is in it! What is that He does? He has unclasp'd a knife! He means To murder the poor man!âHe will!âHe does! Stop! Norris!â'tis thy father! Nor. Furies! fiends! What mean you? Clergyman. What mean you? The blood is gone Even from thy very lips! while all beside Look as they look'd before! Thou'rt a bad man! Nor. What heeds a raving girl? Mari. Where have I been?â The church? Oh! I remember!âAll is right!â Here, Norris, take my hand! [They approach the altarâWolf risesâNorris lets go Marian's hand, and retreats several pacesâthe rest pause. Nor. Hell! what is here? Like something from a grave, or from the sea Cast up untimely and unnaturally; Or, worse, a prisoner from the evil place, If such there be, let out to harrow me Before my timeâaffright me into madness! Edw. Speak not!âObserve! Nor. Wolf!âWolf!âIt is his eyesâ Featuresâbut not the life that moved in themâ His form without his blood! Is it a thing That breathes, or only would be thought to breathe? Wolf! I would rush upon it, but my fears Are bolts that pin me to the spot! Is it come To tell upon me? Cause of blame to him I gave not; he went cramm'd with gold away! Edw. [To Clergyman.] Do you hear? That man has been a partner with him In some black deed! Wolf. I have fled over sea, over land, To get away from it! It follows me! I have plunged into riotâI have tried What solitude would do! It talks to me! I see it in the dead of night as well As in the noon of day. 'Tis only here I have got a respite from it yet! In crowds I have been alone, with it glaring upon me, Gnashing its teeth, and yelling in mine ears! But there's another here that comes between With mild regards, and placid shining face, And gentle voice, which makes, albeit so soft, My torturers unheard, crying âRepent! Confess! Repent! Confess!â Nor. Confess! Wolf. I will Repent, I will confess!âthen am I free! I am a murderer. Nor. Be thou the fiendâI'll know thee! [Rushing up and seizing him. Wolf! Wolf. Norris!âWhat, has it been following thee? Nor. Peace! Wolf. [Furiously.] But there is no peace! It howls, and howls, No foot is fleet enough to distance it, To 'scape the horror of its teeth;âthe bloodhound, No stream that you can wade will clear thee from, That never gives you respite!âexcept here! Here is a chance! This is a place methinks He cannot enter; he has hunted me Till he has driven me wild, but since I'm here, His bay methinks begins to die away. Words have been whisper'd me, at hearing which 'Twas told me he would slacken in his chase. âRepent! Confess!â Those were the words I heard. I will!âI do!âI am a murderer. Nor. Coward, where is my gold? Wolf. All clotted o'er, Corroded, crumbled with the old man's blood, Which thou lett'st out, and I did leave to spillâ Nor. Fiend! Wolf. Do not rave at me! I did not know It was your father! Edw. Hear ye? Nor. Villain!âdie! With a lie in thy throat! [Stabs Wolf. Clergyman. Stop, wretch! Wolf. Thou hast murder'd me! And but for thee I had not murder'd him! But in my soul's strait on the brink of death, I'll show thee pity as I hope to me That mercy will be shown!ââRepent! Confess!â I hear not now the hound!ânor wilt thou hear it, If there be mercy for a parricide! [Dies. Nor. You would not listen to a lunatic! Clergyman. At least, unhappy! thou'rt a murderer! Nor. Which of you would not kill a mad dog? Come! You have no right to hold me! Show me first Your warrant, without which you cannot take A man that's free to prison!âJust as well Hang me without a trial!âLet me breathe! Give me a moment's pause!âLet my arms free! Oh, could I use them now! The blackest curse That lips can utterâheart conceiveâalight On all who enter there!âMay the roof fall And bury you aliveâmay it be in flames! And every door and window fast upon you! My blood lie at your doors!âthe best among ye Is worse than I! My blood be on you all! [He is dragged out. Clergyman. Poor sinner! Grace is broad and free enough Even to cover thee, didst thou repentâ Pattern of love, and piety, and duty, Surely in Heaven thou wouldst have been rewarded? But Heaven defers its guerdon for thee there, To give thee one on earth! Be blest in love! END OF VOLUME I.</field>
