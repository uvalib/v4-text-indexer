      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS. Luitolfo and Eulalia, betrothed lovers. Chiappino, their friend. Ogniben, the Pope's Legate. Citizens of Faenza.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Time, 15—. Place, Faenza.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene.—Inside Luitolfo's house. Chiappino, Eulalia. Eulalia. What is it keeps Luitolfo? Night's fast falling, And 't was scarce sunset . . . had the ave-bell Sounded before he sought the Provost's house? I think not: all he had to say would take Few minutes, such a very few, to say! How do you think, Chiappino? If our lord The Provost were less friendly to your friend Than everybody here professes him, I should begin to tremble—should not you? Why are you silent when so many times I turn and speak to you? Chiappino. That's good! Eulalia. You laugh! Chiappino. Yes. I had fancied nothing that bears price In the whole world was left to call my own; And, may be, felt a little pride thereat. Up to a single man's or woman's love, Down to the right in my own flesh and blood, There's nothing mine, I fancied,—till you spoke: —Counting, you see, as “nothing” the permission To study this peculiar lot of mine In silence: well, go silence with the rest Of the world's good! What can I say, shall serve? Eulalia. This,—lest you, even more than needs, embitter Our parting: say your wrongs have cast, for once, A cloud across your spirit! Chiappino. How a cloud? Eulalia. No man nor woman loves you, did you say? Chiappino. My God, were 't not for thee! Eulalia. Ay, God remains, Even did men forsake you. Chiappino. Oh, not so! Were 't not for God, I mean, what hope of truth— Speaking truth, hearing truth, would stay with man? I, now—the homeless friendless penniless Proscribed and exiled wretch who speak to you,— Ought to speak truth, yet could not, for my death, (The thing that tempts me most) help speaking lies About your friendship and Luitolfo's courage And all our townsfolk's equanimity— Through sheer incompetence to rid myself Of the old miserable lying trick Caught from the liars I have lived with,—God, Did I not turn to thee! It is thy prompting I dare to be ashamed of, and thy counsel Would die along my coward lip, I know. But I do turn to thee. This craven tongue, These features which refuse the soul its way, Reclaim thou! Give me truth—truth, power to speak— And after be sole present to approve The spoken truth! Or, stay, that spoken truth, Who knows but you, too, may approve? Eulalia. Ah, well— Keep silence then, Chiappino! Chiappino. You would hear, You shall now,—why the thing we please to style My gratitude to you and all your friends For service done me, is just gratitude So much as yours was service: no whit more. I was born here, so was Luitolfo; both At one time, much with the same circumstance Of rank and wealth; and both, up to this night Of parting company, have side by side Still fared, he in the sunshine—I, the shadow. “Why?” asks the world. “Because,” replies the world To its complacent self, “these playfellows, “Who took at church the holy-water drop “Each from the other's finger, and so forth,— “Were of two moods: Luitolfo was the proper “Friend-making, everywhere friend-finding soul, “Fit for the sunshine, so, it followed him. “A happy-tempered bringer of the best “Out of the worst; who bears with what's past cure, “And puts so good a face on 't—wisely passive “Where action's fruitless, while he remedies “In silence what the foolish rail against; “A man to smooth such natures as parade “Of opposition must exasperate; “No general gauntlet-gatherer for the weak “Against the strong, yet over-scrupulous “At lucky junctures; one who won't forego “The after-battle work of binding wounds, “Because, forsooth he 'd have to bring himself “To side with wound-inflictors for their leave!” —Why do you gaze, nor help me to repeat What comes so glibly from the common mouth, About Luitolfo and his so-styled friend? Eulalia. Because that friend's sense is obscured . . . Chiappino. I thought You would be readier with the other half Of the world's story, my half! Yet, 't is true. For all the world does say it. Say your worst! True, I thank God, I ever said “you sin,” When a man did sin: if I could not say it, I glared it at him; if I could not glare it, I prayed against him; then my part seemed over. God's may begin yet: so it will, I trust. Eulalia. If the world outraged you, did we? Chiappino. What's “me” That you use well or ill? It's man, in me, All your successes are an outrage to, You all, whom sunshine follows, as you say! Here's our Faenza birthplace; they send here A provost from Ravenna: how he rules, You can at times be eloquent about. “Then, end his rule!”—“Ah yes, one stroke does that! “But patience under wrong works slow and sure. “Must violence still bring peace forth? He, beside, “Returns so blandly one's obeisance! ah— “Some latent virtue may be lingering yet, “Some human sympathy which, once excite, “And all the lump were leavened quietly: “So, no more talk of striking, for this time!” But I, as one of those he rules, won't bear These pretty takings-up and layings-down Our cause, just as you think occasion suits. Enough of earnest, is there? You'll play, will you? Diversify your tactics, give submission, Obsequiousness and flattery a turn, While we die in our misery patient deaths? We all are outraged then, and I the first: I, for mankind, resent each shrug and smirk, Each beck and bend, each . . . all you do and are, I hate! Eulalia. We share a common censure, then. T is well you have not poor Luitolfo's part Nor mine to point out in the wide offence. Chiappino. Oh, shall I let you so escape me, lady? Come, on your own ground, lady,—from yourself, (Leaving the people's wrong, which most is mine) What have I got to be so grateful for? These three last fines, no doubt, one on the other Paid by Luitolfo? Eulalia. Shame, Chiappino! Chiappino. Shame Fall presently on who deserves it most! —Which is to see. He paid my fines—my friend, Your prosperous smooth lover presently, Then, scarce your wooer,—soon, your husband: well— I loved you. Eulalia. Hold! Chiappino. You knew it, years ago. When my voice faltered and my eye grew dim Because you gave me your silk mask to hold— My voice that greatens when there's need to curse The people's Provost to their heart's content, —My eye, the Provost, who bears all men's eyes, Banishes now because he cannot bear,— You knew . . . but you do your parts—my part, I: So be it! You flourish, I decay: all's well. Eulalia. I hear this for the first time. Chiappino. The fault's there? Then my days spoke not, and my nights of fire Were voiceless? Then the very heart may burst, Yet all prove nought, because no mincing speech Tells leisurely that thus it is and thus? Eulalia, truce with toying for this once! A banished fool, who troubles you to-night For the last time—why, what's to fear from me? You knew I loved you! Eulalia. Not so, on my faith! You were my now-affianced lover's friend— Came in, went out with him, could speak as he All praise your ready parts and pregnant wit; See how your words come from you in a crowd! Luitolfo's first to place you o'er himself In all that challenges respect and love: Yet you were silent then, who blame me now. I say all this by fascination, sure: I, all but wed to one I love, yet listen! It must be, you are wronged, and that the wrongs Luitolfo pities . . . Chiappino. —You too pity? Do! But hear first what my wrongs are; so began This talk and so shall end this talk. I say, Was 't not enough that I must strive (I saw) To grow so far familiar with your charms As next contrive some way to win them—which To do, an age seemed far too brief—for, see! We all aspire to heaven; and there lies heaven Above us: go there! Dare we go? no, surely! How dare we go without a reverent pause, A growing less unfit for heaven? Just so, I dared not speak: the greater fool, it seems! Was 't not enough to struggle with such folly, But I must have, beside, the very man Whose slight free loose and incapacious soul Gave his tongue scope to say whate'er he would —Must have him load me with his benefits —For fortune's fiercest stroke? Eulalia. Justice to him That's now entreating, at his risk perhaps, Justice for you! Did he once call those acts Of simple friendship—bounties, benefits? Chiappino. No: the straight course had been to call them thus. Then, I had flung them back, and kept myself Unhampered, free as he to win the prize We both sought. But “the gold was dross,” he said: “He loved me, and I loved him not: why spurn “A trifle out of superfluity? “He had forgotten he had done as much.” So had not I! Henceforth, try as I could To take him at his word, there stood by you My benefactor; who might speak and laugh And urge his nothings, even banter me Before you—but my tongue was tied. A dream! Let's wake: your husband . . . how you shake at that! Good—my revenge! Eulalia. Why should I shake? What forced Or forces me to be Luitolfo's bride? Chiappino. There's my revenge, that nothing forces you. No gratitude, no liking of the eye Nor longing of the heart, but the poor bond Of habit—here so many times he came, So much he spoke,—all these compose the tie That pulls you from me. Well, he paid my fines, Nor missed a cloak from wardrobe, dish from table; He spoke a good word to the Provost here, Held me up when my fortunes fell away —It had not looked so well to let me drop— Men take pains to preserve a tree-stump, even, Whose boughs they played beneath—much more a friend. But one grows tired of seeing, after the first, Pains spent upon impracticable stuff Like me. I could not change: you know the rest. I've spoke my mind too fully out, by chance, This morning to our Provost; so, ere night I leave the city on pain of death. And now On my account there's gallant intercession Goes forward—that's so graceful!—and anon He'll noisily come back: “the intercession “Was made and fails; all's over for us both; “'T is vain contending; I would better go.” And I do go—and straight to you he turns Light of a load; and ease of that permits His visage to repair the natural bland Œconomy, sore broken late to suit My discontent. Thus, all are pleased—you, with him, He with himself, and all of you with me —“Who,” say the citizens, “had done far better “In letting people sleep upon their woes, “If not possessed with talent to relieve them “When once awake;—but then I had,” they'll say, “Doubtless some unknown compensating pride “In what I did; and as I seem content “With ruining myself, why, so should they be.” And so they are, and so be with his prize The devil, when he gets them speedily! Why does not your Luitolfo come? I long To don this cloak and take the Lugo path. It seems you never loved me, then? Eulalia. Chiappino! Chiappino. Never? Eulalia. Never. Chiappino. That's sad. Say what I might, There was no help from being sure this while You loved me. Love like mine must have return, I thought: no river starts but to some sea. And had you loved me, I could soon devise Some specious reason why you stifled love, Some fancied self-denial on your part, Which made you choose Luitolfo; so, excepting From the wide condemnation of all here, One woman. Well, the other dream may break! If I knew any heart, as mine loved you, Loved me, though in the vilest breast 't were lodged, I should, I think, be forced to love again: Else there's no right nor reason in the world. Eulalia. “If you knew,” say you,—but I did not know. That's where you're blind, Chiappino!—a disease Which if I may remove, I'll not repent The listening to. You cannot, will not, see How, place you but in every circumstance Of us, you are just now indignant at, You'd be as we. Chiappino. I should be? . . . that; again! I, to my friend, my country and my love, Be as Luitolfo and these Faentines? Eulalia. As we. Chiappino. Now, I'll say something to remember. I trust in nature for the stable laws Of beauty and utility.—Spring shall plant, And Autumn garner to the end of time: I trust in God—the right shall be the right And other than the wrong, while he endures: I trust in my own soul, that can perceive The outward and the inward, nature's good And God's: so, seeing these men and myself, Having a right to speak, thus do I speak. I'll not curse—God bears with them, well may I— But I—protest against their claiming me. I simply say, if that's allowable. I would not (broadly) do as they have done. —God curse this townful of born slaves, bred slaves, Branded into the blood and bone, slaves! Curse Whoever loves, above his liberty, House, land or life! and . . . [A knocking without. —bless my hero-friend, Luitolfo! Eulalia. How he knocks! Chiappino. The peril, lady! “Chiappino, I have run a risk—a risk! “For when I prayed the Provost (he's my friend) “To grant you a week's respite of the sentence “That confiscates your goods, exiles yourself, “He shrugged his shoulder—I say, shrugged it! Yes, “And fright of that drove all else from my head. “Here's a good purse of scudi: off with you, “Lest of that shrug come what God only knows! “The scudi—friend, they're trash—no thanks, I beg! “Take the north gate,—for San Vitale's suburb, “Whose double taxes you appealed against, “In discomposure at your ill-success “Is apt to stone you: there, there—only go! “Beside, Eulalia here looks sleepily. “Shake . . . oh, you hurt me, so you squeeze my wrist!” —Is it not thus you'll speak, adventurous friend? [As he opens the door, Luitolfo rushes in, his garments disordered. Eulalia. Luitolfo! Blood? Luitolfo. There's more—and more of it! Eulalia—take the garment! No—you, friend! You take it and the blood from me—you dare! Eulalia. Oh, who has hurt you? where's the wound? Chiappino. “Who,” say you? The man with many a touch of virtue yet! The Provost's friend has proved too frank of speech, And this comes of it. Miserable hound! This comes of temporizing, as I said! Here's fruit of your smooth speeches and soft looks! Now see my way! As God lives, I go straight To the palace and do justice, once for all! Luitolfo. What says he? Chiappino. I'll do justice on him. Luitolfo. Him? Chiappino. The Provost. Luitolfo. I've just killed him. Eulalia. Oh, my God! Luitolfo. My friend, they're on my trace; they'll have me—now! They're round him, busy with him: soon they'll find He's past their help, and then they'll be on me! Chiappino, save Eulalia! I forget . . . Were you not bound for . . . Chiappino. Lugo? Luitolfo. Ah—yes—yes! That was the point I prayed of him to change. Well, go—be happy! Is Eulalia safe? They're on me! Chiappino. 'T is through me they reach you, then! Friend, seem the man you are! Lock arms—that's right! Now tell me what you've done; explain how you That still professed forbearance, still preached peace, Could bring yourself . . . Luitolfo. What was peace for, Chiappino? I tried peace: did that promise, when peace failed, Strife should not follow? All my peaceful days Were just the prelude to a day like this. I cried “You call me ‘friend’: save my true friend! “Save him, or lose me!” Chiappino. But you never said You meant to tell the Provost thus and thus. Luitolfo. Why should I say it? What else did I mean? Chiappino. Well? He persisted? Luitolfo. —“Would so order it “You should not trouble him too soon again.” I saw a meaning in his eye and lip; I poured my heart's store of indignant words Out on him: then—I know not! He retorted, And I . . . some staff lay there to hand—I think He bade his servants thrust me out—I struck . . . Ah, they come! Fly you, save yourselves, you two! The dead back-weight of the beheading axe! The glowing trip-hook, thumbscrews and the gadge! Eulalia. They do come! Torches in the Place! Farewell, Chiappino! You can work no good to us— Much to yourself; believe not, all the world Must needs be cursed henceforth! Chiappino. And you? Eulalia. I stay. Chiappino. Ha, ha! Now, listen! I am master here! This was my coarse disguise; this paper shows My path of flight and place of refuge—see— Lugo, Argenta, past San Nicolo, Ferrara, then to Venice and all's safe! Put on the cloak! His people have to fetch A compass round about. There's time enough Ere they can reach us, so you straightway make For Lugo . . . nay, he hears not! On with it— The cloak, Luitolfo, do you hear me? See— He obeys he knows not how. Then, if I must— Answer me! Do you know the Lugo gate? Eulalia. The north-west gate, over the bridge? Luitolfo. I know. Chiappino. Well, there—you are not frightened? all my route Is traced in that: at Venice you escape Their power. Eulalia, I am master here! [Shouts from without. He pushes out Luitolfo, who complies mechanically. In time! Nay, help me with him—so! He's gone. Eulalia. What have you done? On you, perchance, all know The Provost's hater, will men's vengeance fall As our accomplice. Chiappino. Mere accomplice? See! [Putting on Luitolfo's vest. Now, lady, am I true to my profession, Or one of these? Eulalia. You take Luitolfo's place? Chiappino. Die for him. Eulalia. Well done! [Shouts increase. Chiappino. How the people tarry! I can't be silent; I must speak: or sing— How natural to sing now! Eulalia. Hush and pray! We are to die; but even I perceive 'T is not a very hard thing so to die. My cousin of the pale-blue tearful eyes, Poor Cesca, suffers more from one day's life With the stern husband; Tisbe's heart goes forth Each evening after that wild son of hers, To track his thoughtless footstep through the streets: How easy for them both to die like this! I am not sure that I could live as they. Chiappino. Here they come, crowds! They pass the gate? Yes!—No!— One torch is in the courtyard. Here flock all. Eulalia. At least Luitolfo has escaped. What cries! Chiappino. If they would drag one to the market-place, One might speak there! Eulalia. List, list! Chiappino. They mount the steps. Enter the Populace. Chiappino. I killed the Provost! The Populace [speaking together]. 'T was Chiappino, friends! Our saviour! The best man at last as first! He who first made us feel what chains we wore, He also strikes the blow that shatters them, He at last saves us—our best citizen! —Oh, have you only courage to speak now? My eldest son was christened a year since “Cino” to keep Chiappino's name in mind— Cino, for shortness merely, you observe! The city's in our hands. The guards are fled. Do you, the cause of all, come down—come up— Come out to counsel us, our chief, our king, Whate'er rewards you! Choose your own reward! The peril over, its reward begins! Come and harangue us in the market-place! Eulalia. Chiappino? Chiappino. Yes—I understand your eyes! You think I should have promptlier disowned This deed with its strange unforeseen success, In favour of Luitolfo. But the peril, So far from ended, hardly seems begun. To-morrow, rather, when a calm succeeds, We easily shall make him full amends: And meantime—if we save them as they pray, And justify the deed by its effects? Eulalia. You would, for worlds, you had denied at once. Chiappino. I know my own intention, be assured! All's well. Precede us, fellow-citizens!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene.—The Market-place. Luitolfo in disguise mingling with the Populace assembled opposite the Provost's Palace. 1st Bystander [to Luitolfo]. You, a friend of Luitolfo's? Then, your friend is vanished,—in all probability killed on the night that his patron the tyrannical Provost was loyally suppressed here, exactly a month ago, by our illustrious fellow-citizen, thrice-noble saviour, and new Provost that is like to be, this very morning,—Chiappino! Luitolfo. He the new Provost? 2nd Bystander. Up those steps will he go, and beneath yonder pillar stand, while Ogniben, the Pope's Legate from Ravenna, reads the new dignitary's title to the people, according to established custom: for which reason, there is the assemblage you inquire about. Luitolfo. Chiappino—the late Provost's successor? Impossible! But tell me of that presently. What I would know first of all is, wherefore Luitolfo must so necessarily have been killed on that memorable night? 3rd Bystander. You were Luitolfo's friend? So was I. Never, if you will credit me, did there exist so poorspirited a milksop. He, with all the opportunities in the world, furnished by daily converse with our oppressor, would not stir a finger to help us: and, when Chiappino rose in solitary majesty and . . . how does one go on saying? . . . dealt the godlike blow,—this Luitolfo, not unreasonably fearing the indignation of an aroused and liberated people, fled precipitately. He may have got trodden to death in the press at the south-east gate, when the Provost's guards fled through it to Ravenna, with their wounded master,—if he did not rather hang himself under some hedge. Luitolfo. Or why not simply have lain perdue in some quiet corner,—such as San Cassiano, where his estate was,—receiving daily intelligence from some sure friend, meanwhile, as to the turn matters were taking here—how, for instance, the Provost was not dead, after all, only wounded—or, as to-day's news would seem to prove, how Chiappino was not Brutus the Elder, after all, only the new Provost—and thus Luitolfo be enabled to watch a favourable opportunity for returning? Might it not have been so? 3rd Bystander. Why, he may have taken that care of himself, certainly, for he came of a cautious stock. I'll tell you how his uncle, just such another gingerly treader on tiptoes with finger on lip,—how he met his death in the great plague-year: dico vobis! Hearing that the seventeenth house in a certain street was infected, he calculates to pass it in safety by taking plentiful breath, say, when he shall arrive at the eleventh house; then scouring by, holding that breath, still he be got so far on the other side as number twenty-three, and thus elude the danger.—And so did he begin; but, as he arrived at thirteen, we will say, —thinking to improve on his precaution by putting up a little prayer to St. Nepomucene of Prague, this exhausted so much of his lungs' reserve, that at sixteen it was clean spent,—consequently at the fatal seventeen he inhaled with a vigour and persistence enough to suck you any latent venom out of the heart of a stone— Ha, ha! Luitolfo [aside]. (If I had not lent that man the money he wanted last spring, I should fear this bitterness was attributable to me.) Luitolfo is dead then, one may conclude? 3rd Bystander. Why, he had a house here, and a woman to whom he was affianced; and as they both pass naturally to the new Provost, his friend and heir . . . Luitolfo. Ah, I suspected you of imposing on me with your pleasantry! I know Chiappino better. 1st Bystander. (Our friend has the bile! After all, I do not dislike finding somebody vary a little this general gape of admiration at Chiappino's glorious qualities.) Pray, how much may you know of what has taken place in Faenza since that memorable night? Luitolfo. It is most to the purpose, that I know Chiappino to have been by profession a hater of that very office of Provost, you now charge him with proposing to accept. 1st Bystander. Sir, I'll tell you. That night was indeed memorable. Up we rose, a mass of us, men, women, children; out fled the guards with the body of the tyrant; we were to defy the world: but, next grey morning, “What will Rome say?” began everybody. You know we are governed by Ravenna, which is governed by Rome. And quietly into the town, by the Ravenna road, comes on muleback a portly personage, Ogniben by with name, the quality of Pontifical Legate; trots briskly through the streets humming a “Cur fremuere gentes,” and makes directly for the Provost's Palace—there it faces you. “One Messer Chiappino is your leader? I have known three-and-twenty leaders of revolts!” (laughing gently to himself)—“Give me the help of your arm from my mule to yonder steps under the pillar—So! And now, my revolters and good friends, what do you want? The guards burst into Ravenna last night bearing your wounded Provost; and, having had a little talk with him, I take on myself to come and try appease the disorderliness, before Rome, hearing of it, resort to another method: 't is I come, and not another, from a certain love I confess to, of composing differences. So, do you understand, you are about to experience this unheardof tyranny from me, that there shall be no heading nor hanging, no confiscation nor exile: I insist on your simply pleasing yourselves. And now, pray, what does please you? To live without any government at all? Or having decided for one, to see its minister murdered by the first of your body that chooses to find himself wronged, or disposed for reverting to first principles and a justice anterior to all institutions,—and so will you carry matters, that the rest of the world must at length unite and put down such a den of wild beasts? As for vengeance on what has just taken place,—once for all, the wounded man assures me he cannot conjecture who struck him; and this so earnestly, that one may be sure he knows perfectly well what intimate acquaintance could find admission to speak with him late last evening. I come not for vengeance therefore, but from pure curiosity to hear what you will do next.” And thus he ran on, on, easily and volubly, till he seemed to arrive quite naturally at the praise of law, order, and paternal government by somebody from rather a distance. All our citizens were in the snare, and about to be friends with so congenial an adviser; but that Chiappino suddenly stood forth, spoke out indignantly, and set things right again. Luitolfo. Do you see? I recognize him there! 3rd Bystander. Ay but, mark you, at the end of Chiappino's longest period in praise of a pure republic,—“And by whom do I desire such a government should be administered, perhaps, but by one like yourself?”—returns the Legate: thereupon speaking for a quarter of an hour together, on the natural and only legitimate government by the best and wisest. And it should seem there was soon discovered to be no such vast discrepancy at bottom between this and Chiappino's theory, place but each in its proper light. “Oh, are you there?” quoth Chiappino: “Ay, in that, I agree,” returns Chiappino: and so on. Luitolfo. But did Chiappino cede at once to this? 1st Bystander. Why, not altogether at once. For instance, he said that the difference between him and all his fellows was, that they seemed all wishing to be kings in one or another way,—“whereas what right,” asked he, “has any man to wish to be superior to another?”— whereat, “Ah, sir,” answers the Legate, “this is the death of me, so often as I expect something is really going to be revealed to us by you clearer-seers, deeper-thinkers— this—that your right-hand (to speak by a figure) should be found taking up the weapon it displayed so ostentatiously, not to destroy any dragon in our path, as was prophesied, but simply to cut off its own fellow lefthand: yourself set about attacking yourself. For see now! Here are you who, I make sure, glory exceedingly in knowing the noble nature of the soul, its divine impulses, and so forth; and with such a knowledge you stand, as it were, armed to encounter the natural doubts and fears as to that same inherent nobility, which are apt to waylay us, the weaker ones, in the road of life. And when we look eagerly to see them fall before you, lo, round you wheel, only the left-hand gets the blow; one proof of the soul's nobility destroys simply another proof, quite as good, of the same, for you are found delivering an opinion like this! Why, what is this perpetual yearning to exceed, to subdue, to be better than, and a king over, one's fellows,—all that you so disclaim, —but the very tendency yourself are most proud of, and under another form, would oppose to it,—only in a lower stage of manifestation? You don't want to be vulgarly superior to your fellows after their poor fashion—to have me hold solemnly up your gown's tail, or hand you an express of the last importance from the Pope, with all these bystanders noticing how unconcerned you look the while: but neither does our gaping friend, the burgess yonder, want the other kind of kingship, that consists in understanding better than his fellows this and similar points of human nature, nor to roll under his tongue this sweeter morsel still,—the feeling that, through immense philosophy, he does not feel, he rather thinks, above You and me!” And so chatting, they glided off arm-inarm. Luitolfo. And the result is . . . 1st Bystander. Why that, a month having gone by, the indomitable Chiappino, marrying as he will Luitolfo's love—at all events succeeding to Luitolfo's wealth— becomes the first inhabitant of Faenza, and a proper aspirant to the Provostship; which we assemble here to see conferred on him this morning. The Legate's Guard to clear the way! He will follow presently. Luitolfo [withdrawing a little]. I understand the drift of Eulalia's communications less than ever. Yet she surely said, in so many words, that Chiappino was in urgent danger: wherefore, disregarding her injunction to continue in my retreat and await the result of—what she called, some experiment yet in process—I hastened here without her leave or knowledge: how could I else? But if this they say be true—if it were for such a purpose, she and Chiappino kept me away . . . Oh, no, no! I must confront him and her before I believe this of them. And at the word, see! Enter Chiappino and Eulalia. Eulalia. We part here, then? The change in your principles would seem to be complete. Chiappino. Now, why refuse to see that in my present course I change no principles, only re-adapt them and more adroitly? I had despaired of, what you may call the material instrumentality of life; of ever being able to rightly operate on mankind through such a deranged machinery as the existing modes of government: but now, if I suddenly discover how to inform these perverted institutions with fresh purpose, bring the functionary limbs once more into immediate communication with, and subjection to, the soul I am about to bestow on them—do you see? Why should one desire to invent, as long as it remains possible to renew and transform? When all further hope of the old organization shall be extinct, then, I grant you, it may be time to try and create another. Eulalia. And there being discoverable some hope yet in the hitherto much-abused old system of absolute government by a Provost here, you mean to take your time about endeavouring to realize those visions of a perfect State, we once heard of? Chiappino. Say, I would fain realize my conception of a palace, for instance, and that there is, abstractedly, but a single way of erecting one perfectly. Here, in the market-place is my allotted building-ground; here I stand without a stone to lay, or a labourer to help me,— stand, too, during a short day of life, close on which the night comes. On the other hand, circumstances suddenly offer me (turn and see it!) the old Provost's house to experiment upon—ruinous, if you please, wrongly constructed at the beginning, and ready to tumble now. But materials abound, a crowd of workmen offer their services; here, exists yet a Hall of Audience of originally noble proportions, there a Guest-chamber of symmetrical design enough: and I may restore, enlarge, abolish or unite these to heart's content. Ought I not make the best of such an opportunity, rather than continue to gaze disconsolately with folded arms on the flat pavement here, while the sun goes slowly down, never to rise again? Since you cannot understand this nor me, it is better we should part as you desire. Eulalia. So, the love breaks away too! Chiappino. No, rather my soul's capacity for love widens —needs more than one object to content it,—and, being better instructed, will not persist in seeing all the component parts of love in what is only a single part, —nor in finding that so many and so various loves are all united in the love of a woman,—manifold uses in one instrument, as the savage has his sword, staff, sceptre and idol, all in one club-stick. Love is a very compound thing. The intellectual part of my love I shall give to men, the mighty dead or the illustrious living; and determine to call a mere sensual instinct by as few fine names as possible. What do I lose? Eulalia. Nay, I only think, what do I lose? and, one more word—which shall complete my instruction— does friendship go too? What of Luitolfo, the author of your present prosperity? Chiappino. How the author? Eulalia. That blow now called yours . . . Chiappino. Struck without principle or purpose, as by a blind natural operation: yet to which all my thought and life directly and advisedly tended. I would have struck it, and could not: he would have done his utmost to avoid striking it, yet did so. I dispute his right to that deed of mine—a final action with him, from the first effect of which he fled away,—a mere first step with me, on which I base a whole mighty superstructure of good to follow. Could he get good from it? Eulalia. So we profess, so we perform! Enter Ogniben. Eulalia stands apart. Ogniben. I have seen three-and-twenty leaders of revolts. By your leave, sir! Perform? What does the lady say of performing? Chiappino. Only the trite saying, that we must not trust profession, only performance. Ogniben. She'll not say that, sir, when she knows you longer; you'll instruct her better. Ever judge of men by their professions! For though the bright moment of promising is but a moment and cannot be prolonged, yet, if sincere in its moment's extravagant goodness, why, trust it and know the man by it, I say—not by his performance; which is half the world's work, interfere as the world needs must, with its accidents and circumstances: the profession was purely the man's own. I judge people by what they might be,—not are, nor will be. Chiappino. But have there not been found, too, performing natures, not merely promising? Ogniben. Plenty. Little Bindo of our town, for instance, promised his friend, great ugly Masaccio, once, “I will repay you!”—for a favour done him. So, when his father came to die, and Bindo succeeded to the inheritance, he sends straightway for Masaccio and shares all with him—gives him half the land, half the money, half the kegs of wine in the cellar. “Good,” say you: and it is good. But had little Bindo found himself possessor of all this wealth some five years before—on the happy night when Masaccio procured him that interview in the garden with his pretty cousin Lisa—instead of being the beggar he then was,—I am bound to believe that in the warm moment of promise he would have given away all the wine-kegs and all the money and all the land, and only reserved to himself some hut on a hill-top hard by, whence he might spend his life in looking and seeing his friend enjoy himself: he meant fully that much, but the world interfered.— To our business! Did I understand you just now within-doors? You are not going to marry your old friend's love, after all? Chiappino. I must have a woman that can sympathize with, and appreciate me, I told you. Ogniben. Oh, I remember! you, the greater nature, needs must have a lesser one (—avowedly lesser—contest with you on that score would never do)—such a nature must comprehend you, as the phrase is, accompany and testify of your greatness from point to point onward. Why, that were being not merely as great as yourself, but greater considerably! Meantime, might not the more bounded nature as reasonably count on your appreciation of it, rather?—on your keeping close by it, so far as you both go together, and then going on by yourself as far as you please? Thus God serves us. Chiappino. And yet a woman that could understand the whole of me, to whom I could reveal alike the strength and the weakness— Ogniben. Ah, my friend, wish for nothing so foolish! Worship your love, give her the best of you to see; be to her like the western lands (they bring us such strange news of) to the Spanish Court; send her only your lumps of gold, fans of feathers, your spirit-like birds, and fruits and gems! So shall you, what is unseen of you, be supposed altogether a paradise by her,—as these western lands by Spain: though I warrant there is filth, red baboons, ugly reptiles and squalor enough, which they bring Spain as few samples of as possible. Do you want your mistress to respect your body generally? Offer her your mouth to kis: don't strip off your boot and put your foot to her lips! You understand my humour by this time? I help men to carry out their own principles: if they please to say two and two make five, I assent, so they will but go on and say, four and four make ten. Chiappino. But these are my private affairs; what I desire you to occupy yourself about, is my public appearance presently: for when the people hear that I am appointed Provost, though you and I may thoroughly discern—and easily, too—the right principle at bottom of such a movement, and how my republicanism remains thoroughly unaltered, only takes a form of expression hitherto commonly judged (and heretofore by myself) incompatible with its existence,—when thus I reconcile myself to an old form of government instead of proposing a new one . . . Ogniben. Why, you must deal with people broadly. Begin at a distance from this matter and say,—New truths, old truths! sirs, there is nothing new possible to be revealed to us in the moral world; we know all we shall ever know: and it is for simply reminding us, by their various respective expedients, how we do know this and the other matter, that men get called prophets, poets and the like. A philosopher's life is spent in discovering that, of the half-dozen truths he knew when a child, such an one is a lie, as the world states it in set terms; and then, after a weary lapse of years, and plenty of hardthinking, it becomes a truth again after all, as he happens to newly consider it and view it in a different relation with the others: and so he restates it, to the confusion of somebody else in good time. As for adding to the original stock of truths,—impossible! Thus, you see the expression of them is the grand business:—you have got a truth in your head about the right way of governing people, and you took a mode of expressing it which now you confess to be imperfect. But what then? There is truth in falsehood, falsehood in truth. No man ever told one great truth, that I know, without the help of a good dozen of lies at least, generally unconscious ones. And as when a child comes in breathlessly and relates a strange story, you try to conjecture from the very falsities in it, what the reality was,—do not conclude that he saw nothing in the sky, because he assuredly did not see a flying horse there as he says,—so, through the contradictory expression, do you see, men should look painfully for, and trust to arrive eventually at, what you call the true principle at bottom. Ah, what an answer is there! to what will it not prove applicable?—“Contradictions? Of course there were,” say you! Chiappino. Still, the world at large may call it inconsistency, and what shall I urge in reply? Ogniben. Why, look you, when they tax you with tergiversation or duplicity, you may answer—you begin to perceive that, when all's done and said, both great parties in the State, the advocators of change in the present system of things, and the opponents of it, patriot and anti-patriot, are found working together for the common good; and that in the midst of their efforts for and against its progress, the world somehow or other still advances: to which result they contribute in equal proportions, those who spend their life in pushing it onward, as those who give theirs to the business of pulling it back. Now, if you found the world stand still between the opposite forces, and were glad, I should conceive you: but it steadily advances, you rejoice to see! By the side of such a rejoicer, the man who only winks as he keeps cunning and quiet, and says, “Let yonder hot-headed fellow fight out my battle! I, for one, shall win in the end by the blows he gives, and which I ought to be giving”—even he seems graceful in his avowal, when one considers that he might say, “I shall win quite as much by the blows our antagonist gives him, blows from which he saves me—I thank the antagonist equally!” Moreover, you may enlarge on the loss of the edge of party-animosity with age and experience . . . Chiappino. And naturally time must wear off such asperities: the bitterest adversaries get to discover certain points of similarity between each other, common sympathies—do they not? Ogniben. Ay, had the young David but sat first to dine on his cheeses with the Philistine, he had soon discovered an abundance of such common sympathies. He of Gath, it is recorded, was born of a father and mother, had brothers and sisters like another man,—they, no more than the sons of Jesse, were used to eat each other. But, for the sake of one broad antipathy that had existed from the beginning, David slung the stone, cut off the giant's head, made a spoil of it, and after ate his cheeses alone, with the better appetite, for all I can learn. My friend, as you, with a quickened eye-sight, go on discovering much good on the worse side, remember that the same process should proportionably magnify and demonstrate to you the much more good on the better side! And when I profess no sympathy for the Goliaths of our time, and you object that a large nature should sympathize with every form of intelligence, and see the good in it, however limited—I answer, “So I do; but preserve the proportions of my sympathy, however finelier or widelier I may extend its action.” I desire to be able, with a quickened eye-sight, to descry beauty in corruption where others see foulness only: but I hope I shall also continue to see a redoubled beauty in the higher forms of matter, where already everybody sees no foulness at all. I must retain, too, my old power of selection, and choice of appropriation, to apply to such new gifts; else they only dazzle instead of enlightening me. God has his archangels and consorts with them: though he made too, and intimately sees what is good in, the worm. Observe, I speak only as you profess to think and, so, ought to speak: I do justice to your own principles, that is all. Chiappino. But you very well know that the two parties do, on occasion, assume each other's characteristics. What more disgusting, for instance, than to see how promptly the newly emancipated slave will adopt, in his own favour, the very measures of precaution, which pressed soreliest on himself as institutions of the tyranny he has just escaped from? Do the classes, hitherto without opinion, get leave to express it? there follows a confederacy immediately, from which—exercise your individual right and dissent, and woe be to you! Ogniben. And a journey over the sea to you! That is the generous way. Cry—“Emancipated slaves, the first excess, and off I go!” The first time a poor devil, who has been bastinadoed steadily his whole life long, finds himself let alone and able to legislate, so, begins pettishly, while he rubs his soles, “Woe be to whoever brings anything in the shape of a stick this way!”—you, rather than give up the very innocent pleasure of carrying one to switch flies with,—you go away, to everybody's sorrow. Yet you were quite reconciled to staying at home while the governors used to pass, every now and then, some such edict as “Let no man indulge in owning a stick which is not thick enough to chastise our slaves, if need require!” Well, there are pre-ordained hierarchies among us, and a profane vulgar subjected to a different law altogether; yet I am rather sorry you should see it so clearly: for, do you know what is to—all but save you at the Day of Judgment, all you men of genius? It is this: that, while you generally began by pulling down God, and went on to the end of your life, in one effort at setting up your own genius in his place,—still, the last, bitterest concession wrung with the utmost unwillingness from the experience of the very loftiest of you, was invariably —would one think it?—that the rest of mankind, down to the lowest of the mass, stood not, nor ever could stand, just on a level and equality with yourselves. That will be a point in the favour of all such, I hope and believe. Chiappino. Why, men of genius are usually charged, I think, with doing just the reverse; and at once acknowledging the natural inequality of mankind, by themselves participating in the universal craving after, and deference to, the civil distinctions which represent it. You wonder they pay such undue respect to titles and badges of superior rank. Ogniben. Not I (always on your own ground and showing, be it noted!) Who doubts that, with a weapon to brandish, a man is the more formidable? Titles and badges are exercised as such a weapon, to which you and I look up wistfully. We could pin lions with it moreover, while in its present owner's hands it hardly prods rats. Nay, better than a mere weapon of easy mastery and obvious use, it is a mysterious divining rod that may serve us in undreamed-of ways. Beauty, strength, intellect —men often have none of these, and yet conceive pretty accurately what kind of advantages they would bestow on the possessor. We know at least what it is we make up our mind to forego, and so can apply the fittest substitute in our power. Wanting beauty, we cultivate good humour; missing wit, we get riches: but the mystic unimaginable operation of that gold collar and string of Latin names which suddenly turned poor stupid little peevish Cecco of our town into natural lord of the best of us—a Duke, he is now—there indeed is a virtue to be reverenced! Chiappino. Ay, by the vulgar: not by Messere Stiatta the poet, who pays more assiduous court to him than anybody. Ogniben. What else should Stiatta pay court to? He has talent, not honour and riches: men naturally covet what they have not. Chiappino. No, or Cecco would covet talent, which he has not, whereas he covets more riches, of which he has plenty, already. Ogniben. Because a purse added to a purse makes the holder twice as rich: but just such another talent as Stiatta's, added to what he now possesses, what would that profit him? Give the talent a purse indeed, to do something with! But lo, how we keep the good people waiting! I only desired to do justice to the noble sentiments which animate you, and which you are too modest to duly enforce. Come, to our main business: shall we ascend the steps? I am going to propose you for Provost to the people; they know your antecedents, and will accept you with a joyful unanimity: whereon I confirm their choice. Rouse up! Are you nerving yourself to an effort? Beware the disaster of Messere Stiatta we were talking of! who, determining to keep an equal mind and constant face on whatever might be the fortune of his last new poem with our townsmen, heard too plainly “hiss, hiss, hiss,” increase every moment. Till at last the man fell senseless: not perceiving that the portentous sounds had all the while been issuing from between his own nobly clenched teeth, and nostrils narrowed by resolve. Chiappino. Do you begin to throw off the mask?—to jest with me, having got me effectually into your trap? Ogniben. Where is the trap, my friend? You hear what I engage to do, for my part: you, for yours, have only to fulfil your promise made just now within doors, of professing unlimited obedience to Rome's authority in my person. And I shall authorize no more than the simple re-establishment of the Provostship and the conferment of its privileges upon yourself: the only novel stipulation being a birth of the peculiar circumstances of the time. Chiappino. And that stipulation? Ogniben. Just the obvious one—that in the event of the discovery of the actual assailant of the late Provost . . . Chiappino. Ha! Ogniben. Why, he shall suffer the proper penalty, of course; what did you expect? Chiappino. Who heard of this? Ogniben. Rather, who needed to hear of this? Chiappino. Can it be, the popular rumour never reached you . . . Ogniben. Many more such rumours reach me, friend, than I choose to receive; those which wait longest have best chance. Has the present one sufficiently waited? Now is its time for entry with effect. See the good people crowding about yonder palace-steps—which we may not have to ascend, after all. My good friends! (nay, two or three of you will answer every purpose)— who was it fell upon and proved nearly the death of your late Provost? His successor desires to hear, that his day of inauguration may be graced by the act of prompt bare justice we all anticipate. Who dealt the blow that night, does anybody know? Luitolfo [coming forward]. I! All. Luitolfo! Luitolfo. I avow the deed, justify and approve it, and stand forth now, to relieve my friend of an unearned responsibility. Having taken thought, I am grown stronger: I shall shrink from nothing that awaits me. Nay, Chiappino—we are friends still: I dare say there is some proof of your superior nature in this starting aside, strange as it seemed at first. So, they tell me, my horse is of the right stock, because a shadow in the path frightens him into a frenzy, makes him dash my brains out. I understand only the dull mule's way of standing stockishly, plodding soberly, suffering on occasion a blow or two with due patience. Eulalia. I was determined to justify my choice, Chiappino,—to let Luitolfo's nature vindicate itself. Henceforth we are undivide, whatever be our fortune. Ogniben. Now, in these last ten minutes of silence, what have I been doing, deem you? Putting the finishing stroke to a homily of mine, I have long taken thought to perfect, on the text, “Let whoso thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.” To your house, Luitolfo! Still silent, my patriotic friend? Well, that is a good sign however. And you will go aside for a time? That is better still. I understand: it would be easy for you to die of remorse here on the spot and shock us all, but you mean to live and grow worthy of coming back to us one day. There, I will tell everybody; and you only do right to believe you must get better as you get older. All men do so: they are worst in childhood, improve in manhood, and get ready in old age for another world. Youth, with its beauty and grace, would seem bestowed on us for some such reason as to make us partly endurable till we have time for really becoming so of ourselves, without their aid; when they leave us. The sweetest child we all smile on for his pleasant want of the whole world to break up, or suck in his mouth, seeing no other good in it—would be rudely handled by that world's inhabitants, if he retained those angelic infantine desires when he had grown six feet high, black and bearded. But, little by little, he sees fit to forego claim after claim on the world, puts up with a less and less share of its good as his proper portion; and when the octogenarian asks barely a sup of gruel and a fire of dry sticks, and thanks you as for his full allowance and right in the common good of life,— hoping nobody may murder him,—he who began by asking and expecting the whole of us to bow down in worship to him,—why, I say he is advanced, far onward, very far, nearly out of sight like our friend Chiappino yonder. And now—(ay, good-bye to you! He turns round the north-west gate: going to Lugo again? Good-bye!) —and now give thanks to God, the keys of the Provost's palace to me, and yourselves to profitable meditation at home! I have known Four-and-twenty leaders of revolts.</field>
