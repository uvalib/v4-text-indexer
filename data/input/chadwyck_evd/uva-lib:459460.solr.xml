      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCENE I. Ormin. alone. Charming aboad, delightfull solitude, Fair places where I first receiv'd my life And love, old trees, cleer brooks, whose shade and murmur Speak pity for my sorrowfull adventure, Sweet Zephirs, Eccho, rocks, and silent forrests, Be witnesses all of my secret griefs: I am no more now that Zelinda sometime Adored by the worthiest Lovers of The country round about; alas! I serve Vnder the habit of a Slave, a traitor With an unparraleld'd fidelity, Traitor in Love, I meane, not otherwise, A Hero, but ingratefull, one who slatters me In my extream misfortune, yet would hate me, If he knew that I Love him. Gentle trees, Happy are you, although the rigourous winter Vseth you hardly, for when the fair Spring Maketh the cold to cease, you suddenly Resume your anci?t verdure, and at harvest, Vpon your branches wee see fruits, where formerly Hung Isicles: my fortune's not so good; Each of the seasons have twice chaung'd, since Love Resolved to afflict me, all which time I've languished continually, and could not Pretend to the repose my heart hath lost: He whom I love with so much constancy Is false and fleeting; o Gods! here he comes. SCENE. II. ZEGRY, ORMIN. Zegry. Ormin, I sought thee. Ormin. Sir, I sought you also. Zegry. Know that to morrow we will depart hence. Ormin. What! will you leave so soon your native country, These cottages, these woods and these fair meadows? Zegry. I have not hid from thee that in those places I love the sweet Fatima, a rich Master-piece Of Heaven, and hop'd to see that Beauty here So cherish'd and ador'd; but I have learn'd That she is now at Tunis with her Father; And though this happy residence may be said To be a second Paradise, I cannot See any fair thing here, since she is absent. Ormin. How happy is Fatima, and how miserable Am I!â aside. Zegry. How grievous is her absence to My amourous soul! to render me by her, To morrow by the break of day we'll take Our way for Tunis, I shall be too happy: If I may see her, and I do believe That she will bear some part too in my joy; She had no little trouble, I perceiv'd, For my departure last, and without doubt I'm not indifferent to her. Ormin. Certainly Her flame will not be quench'd. Zegry. That's all my hope. Ormin. And that is all my feareâ aside. SCENE III. ALABEZ, ZEGRY, ORMIN. Alabez. Cheer up, cheer up, Smother your sighs, I have a counter poison For all your sorrows. Zegry. Speak it then without Holding us long in trouble. Alabez. Give me leave. First, if you please, to take a little breath. Zegry. Speak then? Alabez. I'm not dispos'd yet. Zegry. Oh thou mak'st me. Suffer too much? tell it unto us quickly. Alabez. You might die with it. Zegry. Is't then some misfortune Sent me by destiny? Alabez. I say agiane. You might die with it, but t'would be with joy; Fatima yesterday late in the evening Arrived in these quarters. Zegry. Is it possible, Fatima? Alabez. Yes, assure you, I have seen her. Zegry. Perhaps thou art deceiv'd. Alabez. I am no asse. I did observe her well, and knew her perfectly. Her Slave, who was my Mistresse formerly, Entered just now with her into that wood. Zegry. Good Gods? do I not see her? Alabez. Yes, that's she Which passeth by. Zegry. What lustre hath her eye; What grace her gate? Ormin. Alas? Zegry. I see a thousand new charms there. Alabez. Are you besotted? wil you not salute her? Zegry. No, to perform that complement, I'le give her A visit, when I shall have without doubt My soul lesse in disorder. Alabez. For my part, Who do not love so daintily, I will, Without deferring it, make my addresse. Zegry. Without discovering our selves, we may From hence know by the usage of the servant, In what esteem the Master is at present. SCENE IV. ALABEZ, CHARIFA, FATIMA, Zegry, Ormin. Alabez. Sweet Beauties welcome, from what quarters come you? CHARIFA. What means this insolent? Go on your way Alabez. How's this? instead of kisses and embraces, As I expected, I am quarrel d with: Charifa, whence this change? CHARIFA. Begone, and leave us. Alabez. Thou actest well the scornfull. FATIMA. What's that fellow Which followes us? CHARIFA. Tis an impertinent, Whom I know not. ALABEZ. I am much changed then Since this last voyage; but thy soul is ch?g'd And not my visage, without doubt thy Mistresse Hath better eyes, and more wit; she will know An old, and a familiar acquaintance. FATIMA. Who are you then? ALABEZ. My Masters Slave. FATIMA. What Master? ALABEZ. Should you not know him neither? Is his name raz'd out of your memory? Fatima. Assuredly, Charifa, this man's mad. Alabez. How, Madam, is it possible you can Forget the valiant Zegry? Fatima. Zegry? Zegry. Heaven? What strange inconstancy is this? who ever Could have imagin'd it?â aside. Alabez. That noble and illustrious successour Of those brave warriers who even in Spain Have gathered Lawrells, and brought home faire spoils, Madam, your faithfull Lover, Zaida's brother. Fatima. Oh! I remember him. Zegry. False, and Ingratefull! Alabez. You ask not how he doth. Fatima. What interest Have I in his sweet person? happily He's dead. Alabez. He is indeed. Fatima. We are all mortall; The Prophet hath his soul. Charifa. A faithfull servant Would have accompanied his Master; why Art thou not dead too? Alabez. Only to enrage thee. Zegry discovering himself. Zegry. The Prophet hath his soul, o false Fatima! Is't thus you do expresse your goodness to me? Deceitfull object, my return, I see, Displeaseth you, who would despise me dead, Must hate me living, I disturb with pleasure That faithless joy which the delightfull news Of my feign'd death procur'd you: I live still Ingratefull, but I live no more for you: My passion is transform d all into fury: As much as I lov'd you, I now despise you: My heart shakes of so rigourous a yoak: Love raiseth no more sighs, nor fires within me, Only I sigh that I us'd so much care To please you, and if I burn yet, it is With anger, not with love. Ormin. Oh this successe Answereth my wishes fully?â aside. Fatima. This confession Surpriseth, but no way afflicteth me; My first discourse should make you understand That I'm not very tender hearted to you, And, me thinks, after such a cleer contempt As was expressed there you might believe Nothing should trouble me that comes from you, Vnless your amourous addresse: I have A thousand other Lovers braver far Then you, and therefore I daign not to put you In the rank of my conquests. ZEGRY. Sure, your pride Is greater then your beauty, the charm is Dissolv'd wherein I formerly was held; Tis true, I sometime thought you beautifull; But I was amourous, and therefore not To be believed, having now my spirit No more disordered, you cease to be fair And I to be abused, whereas you Pleased me formerly, it was because It is impossible for me, when I Am lov'd, to be insensible. FATIMA. I love you? Heaven! what a strange opinion is this? I never had but strong aversion for you. All your indeavours serv'd but to displease me; But though I hated you, I lov'd your Sister, And twas for her sake that I feign'd to have Some pitty for your passions; her prayer A hundred times restain d my hate, you sware That your daies did depend upon my sight, And yeelding unto her desites I did Enforce mine eyes to smile, when my heart frown d, To the end not to be cause of your death. Zegry. Your eyes have never made a mortall wound. Fatima. Take heed that your do not revive again, One Only of my looks darted more gently, Can change this violent anger into love; But I am verie nice of such a look, It is too rich a price, Sir, for your conquest I limit my desires to see you never, Adieu, become wise, and leave me in peace. âExit Fatima. SCENE. V. ZEGRY, ALABEZ, ORMIN. ZEGRY. Yes false Fatima, I will become wise, Thy contempt is unjust, but mine is lawfull: Since thou pretendest but to make thee hated, I will obey thee, thy unworthy trophy, My heart shal be no more, his charmes are broken, His flames are quench'd; Alabez, follow her Close at the heels, even unto her house; But have a care not to discover thee. Ormin. Her pride's unjust, and not to be endur'd; Your change herein is but too equitable, O how wel should you do to free your heart From the imperious captivity Of such a cruel conquerour, you are Born with too many fair advantages, To obtain nothing but eternall wrongs; There are Sir, other beauties in the world VVhich would be glad to share their flame with yours, To imitate your sighs, and which would tell you That the resplendent honour of a crown Is beneath that to be beloved of An object that one loves. Contempt in love Deserves to be repayed with contempt, And who refuseth, is not worthy of, For the most part, the person that's refus'd. Zegry. How great my griefs are, and how grievous is This proud contempt? o light, and wavering Sex! O black ingratitude! since love began To trouble Lovers, was there ever torment Equall to mine? I fell my heart infected VVith all imaginary griefs. Ormin, Oh? Sir, Believe me, I know some that are much more To be lamented, and if what I know VVere reveald to you, you should have great cause Of comfort by it. ZEGRY. Oh speak, and divert The grief which doth oppresse me. oftentimes A wretch is pleased in his misery VVhen he sees that he suffers not alone. Ormin. O love, I pray thee make his heart grow tender At the recitall of the evill which he Hath caused me, oh make him Sensible Of my sad sufferings?â aside. A young Beauty, Sir, VVhose name and birth, if you please I'l conceal Through decency, only thus much I'l tell you, That she was neer to me and lov'd me deerly, Scarce yet attained to the fifteenth yeer, When love and marriage was proposed to her, And she commanded to expect for husband A man too lovely, and to much belov'd; And who for his part was so farre from being Warm'd with a mutuall flame, that he unlawfully Took an affection for another object: His faithfull Lover with grief understood it But yet a worse misfortune afterward Surprised her, th'ingratefull brak th'accord Of the approaching marriage, and departed For a long voyage without seeing her; I can assure you that her grief was quick, And anger ardent after this affront; But yet her anger was lesse then her love: Although, th'inconstant left her, she retain'd him Still in her soul, and valuing not her sex, Nor fearing death, ith' habit of a man She followed his steps. Zegry meditating ZEGRY. O barbarous rigour! O lamentable passion! Ormin. You wil be More touch'd when you shall know the rest: scarce was she Embarked on the sea, when by a new, And worse misfortune certain infamous rovers Surpris'd her vessel, and not long time after They sould her unto that ingratefull man, Who falsly and unworthyly forsook her: And so at last it hapened at that Fortune Afwell as Love would put her into chains: But she still without changing heart, or habit, Found sweetnes in this double slavery; Far from desiring to be free, she follow'd Her faithles friend into his native country, And fearing not to be discovered, Serv'd this deceitfull Master without hope, Indeavoured to please him, and therein Prosper d so well, that he esteem'd her zeal, And conceal'd nothing from her; but this kindnes Was not a cure, but corsive to her grief, Because it made her privy to the happines Her Rivall did enjoy in the affection Of him she lov'd, who every day protested Vnto her, that rather then lose her love, He'd lose his life. Zegry still meditating. Zegry. Vnparalel'd punishment! Cruell injustice! Ormin. Gods! he groweth tender, Love be propitious to me,â aside. Sir, what say you, Is not she more then you to be lamented? Compared to her torments, your afflictions Are sweet. You answer not. Zegry. Yes, yes, I grant it I ought to hate her, but I've too much weaknes: Oh fair Fatima! Ormin. Oh my hard misfortune! Zegry. Ormin, what charms she hath? Ormin. You answer nothing To what I said. Zegry. What spak'st thou to me of? Ormin. Of a young maid Oppress'd and injured in love. Zegry. My thoughts Were otherwise imploy'd, and troubled, I heard thee not, at least I have forgotten. Ormin. You seemed to compassionate her grief, And her misfortune very much. ZEGRY, Alas! I onely thought upon my proper grief. ORMIN, What! shall th'ingratefull and cruel Fatima Although she quits your heart thus, have the glory To live still in your memory? oh no, Banish her thence; but if you'l think of her, To ease your evills a little, imploy your thought Onely to think of her defects; remember That she's too proud, and fancy to your self That she's not fair enough, to hould so noble And such a faithfull Lover as you are, That there is nothing charming in her eyes, Nor in her cheeks, that her proportion, Her posture, stature, gate, and carriage Have nothing commendable, that her wittâ ZEGRY. Ormin, no more, I cannot suffer yet She should be injur'd; that ingrateful Beauty, Who laughs with scorn at my sad languishment, Hath no defect at all but her fierce rigour; And I fear that in spight of this defect, My violent love will triumph o'r mine anger. ORMIN. What, shall Fatima be so proud, and you So humble? shall she be compos'd of Ice, And you of fire? must you persist to love her, When she despiseth you? oh fall no more Into that fatall errour. It belongs, Sir But to low spirits to suffer without hate, Such a contempt; to leave what flyeth us, Is little trouble, and when hope is quench'd, Love should be quenched also. ZEGRI. What thou sayst, Ormin, is verie true, I should indeed Follow Fatima in her lightnes to me, I should in her unkindnes trace her steps, I should be as insensible as she's Severe and rigourous, my flam'es an errour, I doe confesse it, but I love this errour, Thy faithfull counsels are not seasonable, Love hath not yet given place unto my reason, I'm born to languish, and to die for her; Although she be ingratefull she is not The lesse faire for it. ORMIN. The false hope that flatter'd me Fled in a moment; miserable Lover, And too unjust!â aside SCENE VI. ALMANSOR, ZEGRY, ORMIN. Almansor. Friend, I am very joyfull To meet thee. ZEGRY. My content is still compleat, When I behold thy face, as in thy absence, Nothing seems sweet unto me: Now I see Th'art habited like us, this garment is Well made. Almansor. I took it just now in th'apartment I have in thy abode. Zegry. This Shepheards habit Becomes thee rarely; but for an Almansor, It is too much abasement. Almansor. Sure the habit Takes nothing from the lustre of the merit, In imitating thee, I cannot erre; Thee, whose heart is as noble as thy race, And unto whose aid in an eminent danger I owe my life. Zegry. The Shepheards of this wood And fair Campania, are descended from Those Heros, who in time pass'd conquer'd Spain From those renowned Moors, whose great exploits Made the Kings of a hundred Christian people Tremble for fear, and who seeing Tunis conquer'd By Charls the fifth, conserve here in these places Their glory and their freedom, secretly Dispose the hearts of the most Zealous Kings To drive the Christi?s fr? this desolate co?try, And are in readines to joyn themselves, And to encrease the first fair levies which Shall be imploy'd on such an expedition. Almansor. I know that this fair desert's like a Court: But hast thou heard yet that Gomella is Return'd heer? suffer me at present, Zegry, To leave thee, he is my familiar friend, And I owe him a visit. Zegry. Then thou know'st Fatima. Almansor. Yes, that Beauty hath receiv'd The light from brave Gomella; friend adiew, I will return to thee with speed, excuse me At present, I must speak with him upon A busines of importance.â Exit Almansor. SCENE VII. Zegry Ormin. Zegry. A busines of importance? oh that word Redoubleth my affliction; to marry Fatima, without doubt, is his design: Oh Heav?? hast thou ordain'd that, to make up The full proportion of my misery, My dearest fri?d should rob me of my Mistresse? Alas! if this be true, grief, sure will kill me; Dear Ormin, let us use our best indeavour To hinder this misfortune; I expect My only remedy from thy advise. The most resplendent wit yeildeth to thine In point of knowledge, I have observ'd in thee Something thats great, and extraordinary; Thy judgment charms me, and thy care surpriseth me. ORmin. Sir, I'm your Slave, and glory to be so. Zegry. No, no, I make thee free, henceforth be thou Thy Masters friend. ORMIN, The sweetest liberty Pleaseth my fancy lesse then the chains which I bear for you. ZEGRY. This zeal so little common, Makes me grow tender, and amazeth me. Quit, quit thy fetters, Ormin, I commmand it, Be free. Ormin. Since tis your pleasure, I obey; Alas! what have I said, Love, can I be At liberty, when my heart is not free?

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. FATIMA, ZAIDA, CHARIFA, MEDINA. Fatima. Enter again, sweet Zaida, ceremony Between us should be banish d, wherefore will you Trouble your self unnecessarily? Zaida. Since you will have it so, I'l go no further. Fatima. I may assure my self then ere we part, That Adibar shall have no free admittance To your society, I have already Told you, that formerly he loved me; But now I know that you give laws to him And I have cause to hope that, if you scorn him, He may return unto his first subjection. Zaida. Fatima, be assur'd that he shall be Repuls'd, his love will be but troublesome; But if you love me, forget not to feign Some kindnes for my brother; I beseech you For my sake give him cause to hope a little. Fatima. Adieu, I promise you that at next meeting I will receive him better.â Exit Fatima. SCENE II. ZAIDA, MEDINA. ZAIDA. What think'st thou Of fair Fatima, and of her request? Medina. I think that Adibar is not a person To be despis'd. Zaida. True, but I am too proud T'accept a heart that hath been conquered By any other, and would now be mine Through an inconstancie, but if I durst To loveâ Medina. Why stop you, Madam? ZAIDA. Oh Medina! I must not speak the rest. MEDINA. But I divine it; You are in love, and I have cause to judge That it is with Almansor, that fair stranger ZAIDA. Who, I in love with him? MEDINA. Why not, I pray you, Is that a crime? ZAIDA. Oh do not name that love, Which is not other but a fair esteem. Medina. There is so little difference between Esteem and love, that often times we take them One for the other, and are so deceiv'd. Zaida. I cannot but remember that my brother In his last voyage did conclude my marriage In Argier, that he who's design'd to be My husband, is heer shortly to arrive, And that my heart ought to reserve it self Wholy for him. Besides in thy opinion. Would it not argue a great weaknes in me To love this stranger, though my brothers friend. Who hath not been above a moneth among us And whose desert as yet's unknown unto me? Medina. Seeing this Stranger, who's not of the vulgar, Deserves to be caressed of your brother, There's reason to believe that he deserves To be your Lover, and I can't conceive Why your mouth will conceal the flame which is So cleerly for him in your eyes and countenance. As often as he commeth with your brother To visit you, your looks seem to be fix'd Wholy one him, and at the same time also I observ'd often that the stranger ey'd you With the same ardour. Zaida. Prethee, speak in earnest, Did'st see him to behold me oftentimes? Medina. You ask it me with very much impressement: I do believe in lesse time then an howr, That you have question'd me upon this point More then a hundred times; your curiosity Gives me a full assurance that his looks Displease you not, nor wound your modesty Zaida. Alas! can one in justice be offended, To be belov'd? Medina. If his love pleaseth you, I think his person Will please you equally. Zaida. I consider him Without interpreter; but perhaps, he loves Elsewhere, and I may be unpleasing to him. Medina. Madam, although you fain would cover it, This fond suspition publisheth your flame, Iealousy alwaies is daughter of love. Zaida. vvould it pleas'd Heaven, that he were free, and that He thought me fair, But I see him come forth Gomella's house, I'l satisfy my self In sounding of his soul, upon this bank I will repose my self, and feign to sleep. Medina. VVhat's your design? I cannot comprehend it. ZAIDA. VVithdraw, anon thou't understand it better. SCENE III. Almansor Zaida. ALMANSOR. Gomella is expecting his return In visit, heer I may conveniently Dream of my new love: Heaven! do I not see Vnder that flourishing shade the beautious subject Of my sad sufferings? Love in this encounter Seemeth to flatter me sufficiently; It is the lovely Zaida without doubt: How sweetly, and with what tranquility Doth that fair one repose, whil'st wretched I Languish with the disease which she procures me? Surely she cannot hear me now, I may Speak at this present unto her of love, And not offend her; but alas! the rigour Of my sad destiny is great, when I Presume to speak, I fear that she may hear me. You that have taught me the true use of sighs, Dear object of my joy and of my griefs; Suffer my amorous and silent soul T'expresse its secret passion before you, And to complain heer of a thousand evills Which you have made me suffer, yet unkrown Vnto your self: and you resplendent sources Of all my fires, from whence I have deriv'd Such violent heats, fair charming eyes, the authors Of my captivity, enjoy the rest, Which your have taken from me: If I see The poppies which shut up your lids, be not Offended that you lose your lights, the Sun Is subject to the same eclipse, and can No more then you, dispense himself thereof. Zaida feigning her self in a dream ZAID. Almansor. Alm. Sure, she dreams. ZAIDA. Oh! rigourous torment! To burn, to languish, and not dare to speak it, Alas! ALMANSOR. O Heaven! what heare I? ZAIDA. We resent One and the same heat. ALMANSOR. Oh! that it were true! ZAIDA. My modesty, excuse me. ALMANSOR. O favourable sleep! ZAIDA. Cruel constraints! When shal we be content, when shal our plaints Have end? ALMANSOR. In this great extasie of joy, All my respects are vain; to give her thanks I'l kisse her fair hands.â He kisseth her hands. ZAIDA. Hold, insolent; whence doth proceed this boldnes?â feigning to awake, ALMANSOR. What have I done?â aside. I came to give you thanks. ZAIDA. For what? Almansor. Tis for your goodnes. ZAIDA. How, I know not: I'm sure I never gave you any matter For this acknowledgment, who ever will Consult th'apparence of the thing, shal find That I have much indifference for you; But though I had lesse, was it fit to trouble My rest, in making your acknowledgement? Almanzor. Excuse my transport, beautious Shepheardesse, If I had lesse lov'd, I had been lesse guilty; In this occasion a Wary Lover Would have expressed little love in shewing Too much respect; and whatsoer my crime be, It would be pardoned, if you slept stil; But, alas! my good fortune is soon chang'd, I find that you awake but to afflict me, Your eyes in taking unto them again Their grace and lustre, take unto them also At the same time their usual cruelty. And that most charming hope which I so little Enjoyed, vanish'd with your sleep. Zaida. This is An ill expression of your self, that word Of hope gives me astonishment, I never Gave it, nor took it yet from any person. Almanzor. If I might dare to credit your discourse, At least you had not an aversion for me, Nothing would be equall to my good fortune, You would not find my presence trouble some, I should be used better, I should be Esteem'd and possiblyâ ZAIDA. Proceed. ALMANZOR. I might be Belov'd. ZAIDA. Belov'd! of whom; if you magine Of me, you are mistaken. ALMAZOR. Notwithstanding You honored me so much to tell me so: If I may but believe your voice, I have Place in your heart, you are my wltnesse and My judge both at one time; oh disavow not That favorable sentence, that fair Oracle Proceding from an adorable mouth, Those words so full of charms pronounc'd in sleep, Which promised me blessings so soon vanish'd ZAIDA. I dreamt, Almansor, and you are not ignorant That a dream oftentimes is a deceiver, And stil a lie. ALMANSOR. True, a dream is my glory; But I have passions which are real truths, The flame with in mine eyes hath appear'd to you Too cleer, to be concealed, and the coldnes Which you expresse unto me, quencheth not My love, although it ruineth my hope. ZAIDA. This love comes very late, and really I'm troubled at it, you know wel that I Am otherwise engag'd. ALMANSOR. Alas! I cannot Deny but I have heard say that a Lover Favoured of Heaven is to come shortly heer To take you from mine eyes, I know you love him Before you see him, therefore I'le not trouble Your pleasures, nor his joy: how great soever His happines be, I do intend to suffer it VVithout complaining of you, but withall I doe intend to die. As soon as you Shall depart hence upon the fatal voyage Ordained, where your happy mariage Must be accomplish'd, Know, at the same time, That you shall see me in my griefs excesse Depart to go unto the grave, where those Remains of fire which sparkle in my bosom, After my death shall still yet warm my ashes. Zaid: Fortune doth ow you, Sir, a happier lot Alm: My good or evill lot depends on you. All other favours would be troublesome: Lastly I do adore you, and not fortune. Zaida. What expect you from me in the condition Wherein I am? ALMANSOR. Immortall heats and torments; I still must love without hope to be loved. ZAIDA. Who loves much, may hope to be loved likewise ALMANSOR. What may I hope one day for better usage? ZAIDA. Consult with your fidelity upon it. Alm: Your soul appeareth too insensible To love. Zaid: A constant Lover may do much; The first refusal ought not to astonish Any one that hath love enough to give it. ALMANSOR. Oh this is plain enough to my glad sense! ZAIDA. The blood strikes up unto my brow; alas! I've said too much, and now I blush for shame on't. Alm: This glorious confession rendereth me Too happy and content. Zaid: Dreams sometimes are not VVithout effect; but the Sun hath already Finished his career, let us go in Yet further to discourse upon this matter I fear that troublesome. SCENE IV. ADIBAR, ZAIDA, ALMANSOR, ADIBAR. Without too much ambition may I hope The honour to take you by the fair hand The one is free, may I presume to kisse it? ZAIDA. I have no need, Sir, of your services. ADIBAR. They may be worth a Strangers, notwithstanding Your scorn of me. ZAIDA. In thinking to oblige me, You may displease me, by this odd expression. AdibaR. The Prophet, who knows how I reverence you, Knows also how far forth I fear your anger, And the cares which I take, should well assure you, That I come heer but for to honour you: May I aside declare a secret to you? Of some importance? ZAIDA. Nothing is so important As decency, which in th'opinion Of every one, allowes we not the Liberty To hear the secrets of such as you are. ADIBAR. I desire nothing of you what another Doth not obtain ZAIDA. His discourse pleaseth me, And yours I hate. Almansor. You take an unfit time To tell your secrets, to the indiscreet Love seldome is propitious; th incivility Which your pride doth expresse, is an ill me?s To gain esteem. Adibar. I am not heer to take Lessons from you. Almansor. I give them to your equals To all intents and purposes. Adibar. This passion. Which carries you away, convicteth you, And doth excuse me of the incivility Wherewith your errour charged me; a man Better instructed, to avoid suspition, Would have retir'd himself out of respect; You are too grosse; but as you are a Stranger, I ought to bear a little with your ignorance. ZAIDA. You have the faults which you c?demn in him; This Stranger doth oblige me, and you trouble me. ADIBAR. Yet you should take away your hand from himâto Zaida. Almansor. If she should do it, you would be in danger. ADIBAR. In quitting her, you might run to your death. ALMNASOR. I respect Zaida, you I do despise. AdibaR. If by the same respect I were not stop'd, In my revenge, your punishment should soon Follow your insolence. Zaida quitting, Almansors hand. ZAIDA. These hasty motions Are sorry passtimes for me; by this violence I know that neither of you doth respect me, But both offend me. ALMMANSOR. Do you take Your hand from me to answer his desires? My Rivall will become too proud at this: Should you affr?t me with design to please him? Zaida. By what right also am I bound to give You satisfaction? ADIBAR. Madam, I beseech you, Vse no constraint to your free inclination In my behalf, I know which of us two Pleaseth you best, I yeild to him in fortune, And perhaps too in merit, his discourse Is acceptable, mine is hatefull to you; Of this truth I cannot be ignorant; Therefore to th'end I may not trouble you, I will retire me, my respect for you Is stronger then the jealousie, wherewith My amourous soul is justly seised now, And I will force all my resentiments for you, Yea ev? to hate my self, if you should hate me. Let here my happy Rivall without trouble Discourse with you, establish, if you please, His happines at the expense of mine; But take this into your consideration That Adibar, who quits you with regret, Though the least lov'd, is not the least discreet. ZAIDA. VVhere go you Adibar? come back again. ADIBAR. My absence will oblige you. ZAIDA. No, once more I say come back again; if you esteem me, You will return, to take away suspitions Opposed to my glory, lend me, pray you, Your hand, and lead me back.â he gives her his hand. ALMANSOR. Oh'! I cannot Suffer this cruell injury. Zaida. Almansor, Stay I command you, on pain of my hate. ALMANZOR. Hear me a word or two, ZAIDA. I can't be mov'd. Reason I hear, and duty is my guide. Exeunt Zaida and Adibar. SCENE V. Almanzor. What unexpected clap of thunder's this, Which ruineth my joy thus with my hope? Reason I hear, and duty is my guide; My constancy, at these words giveth place To my despair; and duty is my guide No, cruell Zaida in following Adibar, Tis Love that guides you: but what! I may be Too rash in censuring her so; perhaps She doth enforce herself in quitting me, And doth pr?fer my Rivall here before me, To take off all suspition of our love. She loves, she loves me; oh! what say I, fool? Without doubt she hath left me through contempt. Love, like to fickle Fortune is inconstant, His Empire, doth resemble his who doth Command the sea, where nothing is secure, To day a calm, to morrow a sad storm, And every minute, the most fortunate Vpon that element, may fear a change. Even in the Port, We often suffer Shipwrack: These are sad truths, whereof I need not doubt: But what maketh my Slave so hastily T'addresse his steps unto me? SCENE VI. ALMANSOR, GAZUL. Almanzor. Hast thou found Gomella? GAZVL. Yes, Sir and I think that he Adv?ceth heer with large steps to embrace you ALMANSOR. Tis that which my care should prevent. GAZVL. Must I Withdraw whilst you discourse? ALMANSOR. Yes, and be sure Thou fail not to prepare for me a consort Of Musick. GAZVL. How! a consort, Sir, so late? ALMANSOR. Go quickly, and without reply. SCENE VII. GOMELLA, ALMANSOR. GOMELLA. Oh! Sir, How glad am I to see you heer again? ALMANSOR. My joy in seeing you is no lesse great: But speak we of my mother. Gomella. Stay her comming; To morrow without fail she arrives here Vnknown. ALMANSOR. Vnknown! and why dares she not to be seen? GOMELLA. The secret only you must know from her, ALMANSOR. Comes not my Sister? GOMELLA. You must not expect her. ALMANSOR. Where is her residence? GOMELLA. I cannot tell you. ALMANSOR. How's this, Gomella, what can I imagine In the uncertainty wherein you leave me? I am astonished at this proceeding; Your obscure language is a cleer presage Of a conceal d misfortune: Oh! my Sister Is dead, I need not doubt it. GOMELLA. Her death is not The evill which should attrist you. ALMANSOR. What, is't then Hapned vnto her? GOMELLA. No, but something worse. ALMANSOR. That word is not sufficient to cleer me: Shall I not know why I receiv'd an order To depart from Tremissa where I was Brought up, to come with al speed to these quarters, T addresse my self to you with confidence, To change my true name of Abencerage Into that of Almansor, and to have A care not to reveale my family? GOMELLA. Vpon this point I must shut up my mouth: I'm not allowed to say more unto you. It is you Mothers absolute injunction, And request to me; have but patience Vntill to morrow, when you shal be satisfied From her own mouth; but the Sun, I perceive, Already groweth pale before the Moon. Enter into my cot, and take with me A poor repast. ALMANSOR. I doe desire to be Dispens'd thereof now, if it pleaseth you. GOMELLA. VVhere will you go? ALMANSOR. Zegry expecteth me On my engagement at his house to night. GOMELLA. Zegry, what say you, what charm doth oblige you To answer so ill to Abencerage name, To that debate which for a thousand reasons Is, between your two houses, as it were, Hereditary? ALMANSOR. A far juster duty Inviteth me to love him: but for him, I'd lost my life in Cairo, treacherous enemies Encompassed me round, and had he not Succoured me speedily, I had been murthered: His name, which I knew well without discovering Mine own, disturb'd my new born amity; But his, goodnes for me, his cares, his kindnes, Soon dissipated all those old resentements; And so in order to the friendship which Conjoined us, at last we came together Into this country, where I was oblig'd By the same frienship to lodge no where else But at home with him. GOM: Oh Heaven! but proceed. Almansor. You know his Sister: at first sight of her, I was her servant: by a powerfull charm VVhose art she only knows, her fair eyes paid But one look for the purchase of my heart; And if the God of marriage.â Gomella. Soft, hold there. Take heed you flatter not your self with such A fatall hope, destroy your passions, Or you destroy your honour. Almansor. How, my honour? GOMELLA. Yes, Sir, your honour, what! doth this discourse Surprise and trouble you? ALMANSOR. I fear the name Of an ingratefull person. GOMELLA. Fear that also Of a low spirited one; these shamefull moti?s Do wound your duty. ALMANSOR. May I know how? GOMELLA. To morrow, when you see your Mother here, You shall be satisfied, in the mean time, Hate both the Sister, and the brother. Alm: Hate them? I who have been so much oblig'd unto them? No, no, I swearâ Gom: Swear not but let us enter; Your mind will change, when you have heard th'adventure. The end of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III SCENE I. Zegry, Ormin. Zegry. The night approacheth, it is time to put This letter with my hope into thy hands: Work on her Slave, and act discreetly, that She take this diamond from thee, afterward Vse all the skill thou hast to know the secrets Of her disdainfull Mistresse, and consider That I expect at thy return to hear The sentence of my life, or of my death. Ormin. Cruell commandment, whereunto I see My felf reduc'd!â aside. One word, Sir, ere I go, Think well upon it yet, what hope have you? Your importunities will increase her anger, And you should do much better, If I durst To tell you so, henceforth to free your self Of this unworthy Empire; as love is The price of love, so hate should alwaies be The recompense of hate, and of contempt. Your soul's are too ill suited to unite, Love loseth his power in Antipathies, And tis an equall crime, Sir, in a contrary Effect, to hate who Loves us, or to love Who hates us. Zegry. Oh! speak no more on't unto me: My evill's invincible, and my soul feels Too sensibly the charms which doe destroy me; To overcome my griefs, which have no equals I seek some gentle succour, and not counsel, My chain, alas! is too strong, and my heart Too weak, as not to yeild unto the torrent Which carries me away.

ORMIN. Sir, if your eyes could penetrate into The secrets of my heart, you would soon find How great an interest I take in them, And that if your lot lay within my power, Your pleasures should soon passe your hope, I call The Prophet, so much honoured amongst us, To witnes, that I feel the counterstroaks Of all your troubles, that I'm grieved for them As much as you, and tremble in like manner, Lastly that you are dearer to me far Then you imagine, that my happines Depends on the successe of your amours, And that it is for you alone my heart Makes its devotions. Zegry. Grant it gracious Heaven That thy zeal happily succeed in touching In my behalf the soul of that ingratefull: My sister hath already been with her, And I believe she hath not fail'd to speak To her for me, their friendship flatters me; And gives me leave to hope that who esteems The sister, may in time cherish the brother.

And though he appeares blind to my disadvantage, Shall I approve my self so more then he? What shall I presse th'effect of what I fear? Shall I give him content at my sad cost, By a constraint so cruell? and shall I Become my self the faithfull Minister Of the injustices which he doth do me? No, no, let us not serve with so much heat To trouble us yet with a new misfortune, A person who cost me so many tears: If I must die, at least let me not give Arms for to peirce my heart; o'th contrary, Let me act so, that he may hope for nothing From fair Fatima, let me without scruple Betray this false one, and deprive him of A good which would become so fa'tal to me. I should ground all the hope thats left unto me Vpon the losse of his. But how is this, That at these words I tremble with affright? I find my heart already riseth up Against me in behalf of this false Master. Alas! how cruel and perfidious Soer he be, I cannot fail of faith To wards him, but must love, and serve him truly. 'Tis so resolv'd, my anger must give place Vnto the love that raigneth in my bosom: An ill example never justisies A crime: let us deliberate no more; But what's the noise I hear? it is Fatima That passeth, and Charifa follows her. SCENE III. FATIMA, CHARIFA, ORMIN FATIMA. This foul contemps which Zaida offers me Provokes me highly, so far was this false one From hindering Adibar to visit her, (As she engag'd herself in promise to me) That she accepted kindly of his hand, To disoblige me; tis an injury Of such a nature as requires reveng. CHARIFA. The affront is known unto your self, you saw it With your own eyes, and to speak truely Madame, The injustice is extream. FATIMA. Know that my anget Is so too; let us enter, it is late, This night shall give us counsell. ORMIN. I'l go one, And stay no longer, las! I dare not open My mouth, nor keep it shut. Love, I beseech thee, Mingle at least some good in the great masse. Of my misfortunes, graunt that in demanding All things of her, she grant me nothing for him.â aside. Madame, shall I find so much goodnes from you As to allow me the sweet liberty To leave this letter heer in your fair hands?

Hath made slaves; and who, not withstanding all The love wherewith his soul is seis'd, hath griven you Some cause of plaint. FATIMA. Of plaint! ist Adibar That writes vnto me? Softly to Charifa. CHARIFA. Without doubt tis he, My heart doth tell me so. FATIMA. What would that false one Desire of me? ORMIN. How cruell is this sweetnes To me?â aside. The end of his desires is to Appear before you, highly to detest His insol?t crime, he would expresse the trouble Wherewirh his soul is press'd, to the Divinity Iustly offended, and receive in making His fault worthy to be forgot, a pardon. Or death at your fair feet. FATIMA. I desire not His death; but I would have him live and hope; How late soever his repentance comes, I love it, and 't is welcome. My heart is Already pacified by thy discourse. ORMIN. I have for my misfortune, too well sped.â (aside. FATIMA. Let see with what, air, in this letter he Vtters his thought, we will go in to read it, And to give answer; since he is no longer Obstinate in his coldnes, I will send His pardon sign'd and seal'd. ORMIN. How full of joy Will Zegry be at my return? FATIMA. What say you? Zegry. ORMIN. Tis he that sends me, he will kisse The words where with y'ave flatter'd him. Fatima tearing his letter. FATIMA. This is My answer, go, and carry it unto him. Exit Fatima. SCENE IV. ORMIN, CHARIFA. ORMIN. This in equality astonisheth And puzleth me,âCharifa! CHARIFA. No, good night. ORMIN. Hear me, I pray thee. CHARIFA. I take no delight To talk with fools ORMIN. Stay yet a little. CHARIFA. I have not the leisure. Adieu, fair prater! ORMIN. Be not so ungentle. My h?d shall speak gould, to supply my mouth CHARIFA. I don't believe thee. ORMIN. Believe the event. From Zegry take this diamond. CHARIFA. To betraye, And sell my Mistresse? God defend, I will not Receive it. Ormin. Be not such a simple creature. Charifa. I take it then to please thee, but accept it Vnto a good intent: the stone's not false, At least I think so. Ormin. Thou mayst be assur'd on't, Tis very fair, and perfect. Charifa. Pardon me, My words might seem t'imply a doubt, that I Suspected thee, but I am innocent. Ormin. Wilt thou not tell me by what fatall errour Thy mistresse humour chang'd so suddenly? And how it came, that only at the name Of Zegry her heart presently grew cold, Although enflam'd with my discourse before? Charifa. I love thee but too well; and if rhou wilt Be secret, I'l discover unto thee This secret of importance, this hid mistery. ORMIN. Thou wilt oblige me much, speak, I'm discreet. And will concea'lt as closely as thy selfe. Charifa. Fatima then loves Adibar asmuch As she doth hate thy Master; but for her, Adibar by a pleasant fair return Hath no, lesse coldnes then thy master love. Thou knowst that thou art not yet known of her, And that love oftentimes troubleth the brain: Hence was it, that at first she did believe That Adibar sent thee to speak to her; But since she knew her errour, she was mad; I hear a noise, let us speak soft I fear We should be heard. SCENE. V. ALABEZ, ORMIN, CHARIFA. Alabez. The Devill! where thinks my Master That I should meet with Ormin? it is night And I can't find my way. Charifa. Prethee be still. Ormin. Let me alone. thy honour is not much In danger with me. Charifa. Foh! my diamond Is fallen from my finger. Ormin. Without doubt The grasse conceals it from our sight. Charifa. We may Seek it a good while ere we find it heer. Ormin. Yes in this manner, I'le go fetch a light, Exit Ormin. SCENE VI. ALABEZ, CHARIFA. Charifa. Return I've found it.â taking him for Ormin. ALABEZ. I should know that voice; It is Charifa, strange! what might she do So late heer in these woods? I will approach A little neerer.â aside. CHARIFA. Thou but jests with me, Kisse me no more, if thou dost, I'l retire. ALABEZ: A rare piece this! I must hear all. CHARIFA. Yes really, Promise me to be quiet, or I'l leave thee. This is a little too much liberty At first, I am a maid that stands upon My reputation, and fear evill tongues, I hold my honour very precious to me. ALABEZ. Thou seek'st to lose it, and invitest him To take it from thee.â aside. CHARIFA. What thou speakest not A word unto me. ALABEZ. Excellent adventure! CHARIFA. How doth thy heart sigh, and thy close mouth murmur? Those liberties, for all what I have said, May be excus'd, if thou will marry me; Thou know'st that one must marry, to love well And if I please thee.â ALABEZ. Oh? what impudence? CHARIFA. What say'st thou? Alabez. I am much surpris'd, by Heaven. Charifa. What! answerest thou nothing? should this be Through a contempt? I think that I'm not yet So torn by time, as not to be thought worthy To be considered; thou knowest well Alabez, if I would have had that fellow. My marriage with him had been already Concluded, but that is a lowt, and hath not The art to please me as thou hast, his faults Are more considered by me, then his services. ALABEZ. The impudent jeers at me to my face. CHARIFA. That troublesome never did any thing Which pleased me, he hath a sottish spirit, And silly carriage; if the fool should marry me I would not passe my word that he should not Be one of those which every one points at With finger, which permit their neighbours to Think their wives fair, ?d which we comm?ly Call cuckoulds. SCENE VII. ORMIN, CHARIFA, ALABEZ. Ormin. See heer, I have brought you light. CHARIFA. What have I done? this is a grosse mistake ALABEZ. What think'st thou; have not I much cause to be Well satisfied? I have done nothing then That ever pleas'd thee, I've a sottish spirit And silly carriage. Thou shouldst die with shame. Charifa. Why? prethee? I have utteted but a truth. ALABEZ. But a truth, traitresse, o thou brazen face! What! If I married thee, thou dangerous beast I should be of the number of those people Which we call cuckoulds? thy impertinent tongue Lied a hundred times, I'd rather chuse A rope then such a bed fellow: Ormin. Whence springs Your quarrel? ALABEZ: Peace a while, I shall in good time Talk with you, friend, companion of ill luck Ormin putting out the candle. Ormin. We must be gone, there's nothing to be gotten But blows heer by a fool.â Exeunt Ormin and Charifa. SCENE VIII. Almansor, Gasvl, Alabez, Adibar. ALMANSOR. Goe see whence comes this noise. ALABEZ. Oh have I met thee,â giving Gasul a buffett. precious Apostle? GASVL. How base traitor! ALABEZ. Pardon me, I took thee for another, in good faith: I sought a raskal that escaped me, To whom I did intend that injury But I shall soon o'rtake him without running. Exit Alabe. ALMANSOR. Hast learnt the cause of those c?fused rumours? GASVI. No, but I have beene beaten by a person, Who afterward made me excuses for't. ALMANSOR. The house is not far of, give order to The voices to advance, and bid them sing Neer to that Little wood. Adibar appearing on the other side: ADIAAR. See, friends, the place Where Zasda dwels, if you are ready now Begin immediately. The first song. Ye deserts, and dark-cells Where night and silence dwells You whom I trust with my sad cares. GASVL. This voice belongs not to our company. ALMANSOR. This Stanza finish'd, let us be prepar'd To sing forthwith the ayr which I compos'd Ye deserts and dark cells, Where night and silence dwells, You whom I trust with my sad cares, With all my deaths, and my despairs, Rocks, forrests, and thick Shades, Which the Sun ne'r invades, You in whose bosomes I enclose My love, my sighs, my plaints, and woes: Alas! when will you be Keepers of my felicity? Second Song. Ye brooks, and Zephirs sweet, Which heer in Spring-time meet To water and perfume these plains ADIBAR. What insol?t voice troubles our confort heer? Th'affront shal not passe without punishment Ye Brooks, and Zephirs sweet, Which heer in Spring-time meet To water and perfume these plains Frequented by the amorous Strains Favour me not to flovv Oblige me not to blow, Vntill my tears their course have spent, And my sighs given my griefs full vent, Then in your Channells glide, And winds breathe, as before, in pride. ADIBAR. Who art thou that dar'st heer to trouble me? ALMANSOR. My name is too well known to be conceal'd, I'm call'd Almansor. ADIBAR. Fear, fear then mine anger. I'm Adibar, thy greatest Enemy Who to meet thee, have made some weary steps Vnto no purpose; now when least I sought thee I've found thee; tell me, how comes it that thou Takest a licence to besiege my Mistresse With so much insolence? dost visit her, As friend unto her brother, or as Lover And servant unto her? Almansor, Content thy self To understand that as the brothers friend, The Sister doth accept my setvices, And that I reverence her: assure thy self That if I were so happy as to be Her Lover, I should be discret enough, Not to acquaint thee with it. Adibar. These refinings, And juglings which thou usest to defend thee, Cannot withdraw thee from my just revenge, Thou shalt die.â Drawes Almansor. Rather fear that my sword heerâ drawes. Peircing thy heart, qu?nch thy love in thy blood. SCENE IX. Zegry, Adibar, Almansor. ZEGRY. For bear, and moderate this barbarous fury, What means this, friends? Adibar. Nothing, since we are parted. ZEGRY. Oh, ist you Adibar? ALMANSOR. This is not the Song Which I desire. Adibar. Zegry, thou dost me wtong. ZEGRY. What cause, dear friend, could animate thee so? Permit me, I beseech you having parted you, To reconcile you too at the same time: I take an interest in your debats: Let me know therfor what your differnce is. Adibar. Zegry in vaine you interpose your felf To hinder the proceeding, my revengt Is just, and your cares but prolong his life For some few minures.â Exit Adibar. SCENE. X. ZEGRY, ALMANSOR. ZEGRY. Deare Almansor tell me Whence comes so strong a hate between you two? Relate the cause on't, ALMANSOR. Tis not worth the labour; This petty difference which troubles thee, Should be determined ere known. ZEGRY. In vain Thou dost persist to hide this secret from me: Almansor, I ghesse at it; sure, some Beauty Embroils you; I've heard heer two different consorts. The rest I do divine. ALMANSOR. Friend, I confesse it; We both at one time gave our Evering Musick To one and the same Mistresse. ZEGRY. May not I Know her name, Friend? ALMANSOR. Heavens how am I put to t? Should I tell him that I adore his sister?â aside. ZEGRY. Friend, this reservednes suits not that name, I did not hide my amours for Fatima From thee. ALMANSOR. He hath already promised His sister; Im confounded; if I dare To name her, what will he not say?â aside. ZEGRY. This confus'd silence should su fficiently Instruct me that he doth adore Fatima, And dares not tell it meâ aside. What! shall I not Know then what object hath subjected thee? ALMANSOR. Her fair name uttered would make us enemies, Instead of doing thee a courtesy I should do thee an injury; adiew; Dispense me to say more on't. ZEGRY. How is this! Wilt thou not go unto my house? ALMANSOR. Excuse me, This night I am engag'd by promise to Lodge at Gomella's. ZEGRY. How! Gomella's, sayst thou? ALMANSOR. Yes, I fear that he stays for me, adiew, I'ue promised him, and I can't fail my word. Exit Almansor. Zegry alone. ZEGRY. The traitor Loves Fatima: and intends To marry her: to judge on't otherwise, Is to abuse my self; yes owing me, His life, he makes use of it to destroy me; But he that could save it, can also ruine it; And his death loudly shall proclaime to all That the same arm which serves the innocent, Can punish the ingratefull insolent.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. ALMANSOR, GOMELLA ALMANSOR. You shall not go alone to meet my mother, I'l follow you, Gomella. GOMELLA. That needs not Her order doth oblige you to expect her Here at my house. ALMANSOR. But nature doth impose A stronger law upon me. GOMELLA. Sir she hath not Vnderstood of your comming yet, your sight Will be too sudden a surprise, for bear Till I acquaint her with it. ALMANSOR. I expect No blame in this encounter; If I should Surprise her, it would be delightfully: GOMELLA. Seeing you will, let's go together then. ALMANSOR. I do but what I ought. GOMELLA. I speak my thoughts. ALMANSOR. Zegry comes forth his house; before I go, I must embrace him. GOMELLA. Stay, you may not do it. ALMANSOR. Constraint's unjust, as much as it is cruell: Ought I to fly a friend so dear, so faithfull? Suffer me to speak to him, and I'l follow you Immediately. GOMELLA. I cannot, for I have an expresse order Vnto the contrary.â Exeunt. SCENE II. ZEGRY, ORMIN. ZEGRY. Ormin, didst thou observe how carefully That traitor shun'd me assoon as he saw me? Did'st mark how he was troubled at sirst, How he advanc'd, a step or two to Wards me, And then went back again, how he resign'd The place unto me in confusion, Press'd with the stings of his ingratitude? ORMIN. What ever I observed, it can never Enter into my thought Almansor should Be guilty of so base and black a crime; And though in shew I find him culpable, I esteem him incapable to commit Any base act; he still appear'd vnto me A person of much honour, and too jealous Thereof, so ill t'imploy the life which he Holdeth of you: besides I find within me A certain secret instinct which I Can't comprehend, that when I should accuse him, Forceth me to defend him. ZEGRY. Seeing me To cheris'h that too much belov'd Ingratefull, Thou art accustom'd also to caresse him. I can't believe, neither that he betrays me, Nor can I doubt ont, that's my punishment. And those sweet motions, which I scarce can banish, Aggravate his offence, instead of lessening it: Iudge then how much I am to be lamented In this condition, the onely good That rests to me, is to fear nothing more. Fortune would not afflict me hcer by halfs; I lose a Mistresse, and a friend together: Both injure me, and I have so much weaknes. That I can't hate the Mistresse, nor the Friend; But could'st thou yesterday learn from Charifa Why fair Fatima hath so much contempt Within her bosome for me? thou hast told me That Adibar doth charm her, but thou hast not Tould me from whence her hatred doth proceed. ORMIN. Fatima, if I may believe what hath Been told me, alwaies did abhore you for Vnfaithfullnes, she hath some reason to Beiieve you false, and this is that as far As I can understand, which doth oblige her To be so cruell to you. ZEGRY. False, sayst thou? I never was so. ORMIN. She hath understood though, That a maid call'd zelinda, faire enough, Very young, and of an illustrious family, And who received sometime many services From you, being almost on the point to see you Her husband, and when all things were dispos d And ready for the mariage was fouly For saken by you and despis'd; it seems That this example toucheth, and doth teach her That who can once, can ch?ge a thous?d times. ZEGRY. Ormin, this change is no inconstancy. ORMIN. It would be very hard to prove it innocent: ZEGRY. VVithout doubt this pretended mariage Made a great noise; but I will tell thee all ORMIN. VVhat will th'ingratefull say?â aside. ZEGRY. Before that mariage was concluded which VVas to unite us to Abencerage blood, And by that means at last to quench the heat Of an old hatred, fair Fatima was Already Mistresse of my heart; to make me Take a new chain, Zelinda, wh? they offered me In my opinion, was not fair enough: So that I saw her without loving her: Her feeble Beauty could not shake the fetters VVhich tied me, yet I indeavoured To have som kindnes for her, but her eyes Or my heart were not strong enoug to work it; And if I did her any services, It was but in design to please my parents: Fatima there fore is to blame to think That I am false: since I had never love For any but for her. ORMIN. Alas! I need not Doubt more of his contempt! I was inquisitive To know too much, and now I doe repent it. âaside. ZEGRY. This is a truth, which easily can bee prov'd? But how comes it my sister,s up so soon? SCENE III. ZAIDA, MEDINA, ZEGRY, ORMIN. Zaida, Brother, have you receiv'd th'intelligence Is given me of the death of him which was Designed for my husband? ZEGRY. Yes, I've heard it; It is too true, he died in Argier O'th spotted feaver. Zaida. I'm unhappy by it; But you are neer you ioy, and may discourse Of mariage and love. ZEGRY. Oh, Sister, rather Say that I must no longer now discourse Of love nor Mariage: say that I must punish A base and an ingratefull spirit with death One that hath wickedly betray'd my fri?dship: Fury alone presides now in my soul, And I must think nor speak of any thing But of destroying a perfidious wretch. ZAIDA. Who is that traitor? let me know, I pray you, What signall crime provoketh you so highly. ZEGRY. Thou know'st too well the Authour of my injury His name's Almansor, his love is his crime, ZAIDA. His love! what hear I? ZEGRY. Sister, tis too true, His insolent love hath stirred up mine anger. ZAIDA, He knoweth that Almansor loveth me, And that is it enrageth him.â aside. ZEGRY. His death, Is just, add he shall die, base, and ingratefull! ZAIDA. Brother, you should examine without passion All that which might be of a friend suspected, And we should never judge of his offence But with much care and much indulgence: alwaies Almansor htth appcar'd too generous To mingle any foul or unjust thing In his affections; and he oweth you Too much, to have a thought to wrong a fri?d That sav'd his life. ZEGRY. Sister, thou dost oblige me; Thy arguments with little contradiction Disarm all my resentments quite; Almansor Is so dear to me, that how ere he wrongs me, Thou wilt do me a couttesie, to stop My anger. ZAIDA. Perhaps, you have accused him unjustly. ZEGRY. Would that it pleased Heaven I were abus'd! But alas! my suspition is too just, I'l tell't thee now; he loveth ZAIDA. Who? ZEGRY. Fatima: ZAIDA. How! should he love Fatima? really That crime is black: ZEGRY. The better to assure thee on't, tis best Thou go to vissit her, I do believe Thou'lt vnderstand fr? her that he adores her, And that he's false to me. ZAIDA. Traitor! Inconstant! Pernitious Spirit! ZEGRY. But, Sister, VVhy appear you So troubled in your eyes and countenance? ZAIDA. The trouble of mine eyes cleerly denotes That my heart feels the evils which your friend doth you, Your fri?d, what haye I said? that name suits ill With his condition, if he be your Rivall, He's not your friend. Goe persently to quench His life and Love, and wash away the crimes Of his soul in his blood. ZEGRY. No, Sister, no; We should examine without passion All that which might be of a friend suspected, And one should never judge of his offence But with much care and much indulgence; alwaies Almansor hath appear'd too generous, To mingle any foul, or vnjust thing In his affections; and he oweth me Too much, to have a thought to wr?g a fri?d That sau'd his life. ZAIDA. In what an errour are you? ZEGRY. If I am in an errour, I receiv'd it From you: these were your sentiments, good Sister, And shall be mine. Zaida. Then knew I not his crime; But now that it is plain, take your revenge, I will no more restrain you. ZEGRY. Stop me rather; Condemn my anger, not my amity. In favour of Almansor I would be Abus'd; I will accuse him, but I would That others should excuse him, I speak of Revenge, but seek it not, and threaten only But to the end to have my arme restrain'd. His passion, perhaps, may be condemn'd Vnjustly: possibly it might be born. Before our friendship, and, perhaps Fatima Answereth unto it, and that to unite them, Gomellas orders do invite him heer; If it be so, to free my self from crime, Sister, tis just I yeild Fatima to him: I'l break my chains, and with a setled heart Will make the pleasures of my friend mine own. ZAIDA, What strange abuse, what secret charm thus softens Your heart in the behalf of an Ingratefull: He owes his life unto you: ought he not T'acquit him self to wards you by all possible Indeavours? if he be your Rivall, can you Without much weaknes tamely give him up Your Mistresse? if he be your friend, as you Esteem him, ought he not to give you up The object which you love. ZEGRY. Without reply Go presently to visit fair Fatima: And fail not fully to inform your self Of their intelligence.â Exit Zegry. MEDINA ZAIDA. Medina. You astonish me; I can't conceive how one can love a man. And presse his death. ZAIDA. Oh! say not that I love Such an ingratefull and inconstant wretch: Believe that if I have fires, they are fires Of rage, and that my heart will ne'r be quiet Till this perfidious Lover be a sacrifice To my just anger. Medina. But you weep, Madam. ZAIDA, True, I weep, Medina: If that false one should perish, I should die; I feel that rage and tendernes, hate and love Triumph by Turns within me: I'm his Enemy, And yet I am his Lover, when my anger Encreaseth, th'other Kinder passion springs: And though that he be louely, and hath falsely Betray'd me, I can neither love, nor hate him MEDINA. Madam, speak softer, you will elce be heard. Adibar comes to wards us. ZAIDA. I'l not stay. SCENE V. ADIBAR, ZAIDA, MEDINA. ADIBAR. Zaida, where go you with my heart? ZAIDA, I pray you, Leave me alone, and do not trouble me, Adieu. Adibar. Receive my services. ZAIDA, I have No need of them. Adibar. I do beseech you, hear me. ZAIDA. You must excuse me, I have other busines. Adibar. With a look onely, consolate my griefs; Tis you I seek. ZAIDA. And tis you that I fly. Adibar. How! treat you such a faithfull Lover so? ZAIDA. Fatima there will be lesse cruell to you. Adibar. Mock not at her, Fatima is as fair, Although lesse proud then you. SCENE VI. FATIMA, ZAIDA, ADIBAR, CHARIFA, MEDINA. Fatima. VVhat Adibar Still with this scornfull? my revenge is just. 'Tis time that it break forth. Zaida, I find and heavy melancholy, That I lose the design which brought me hither: Shall I dare speak of dances, revels, feasts, And of a mariage in the condition Wherein you are? ZAIDA. What say you, of a mariage? FATIMA. Since you presse me, You shall know all; know rhat my Father hath Provided one for me. Zaida, For you, Fatima? FATIMA. Yes, Zaida, and the busines is well forward. ZAIDA. In your contents I claim an interest: I should be glad to know your Lovers name, FATIMA. He's an accomplish'd man, noble, and brave And of a charming presence, and rare merit: I doubt not but you will approve the choice My Father hath made of him. ZAIDA. How she makes me Languish to meet death?â aside. Well, who is the man? FATIMA. You know him very well; He made long time his ordinary residence At home with you, your brother Zegrys fri?d Have I yet said ynough? ZAIDA. Tell me his name too. FATIMA, Divine you not that he is call'd Almansor! ZAIDA, I can no more, but faint and die.â aside. FATIMA. How she Is chang'd, she feels my pain, and I'm reveng'd AdibaR. I have much interest in this event. ZAIDA. This match without doubt cannot chuse but please you. FATIMA. True, I am not of those who through a maxime Of I know not, what modesty, blush at mariage As if it were a crime, feign to sigh at it, And yet in secret are sad at the heart, If it should not be consummate. I assure you. Vpon this point I not dissemble with you: I no way hate the Lover that's design'd me, I prize his love, his services, his merit At a high rate, and if he loves me much, He is no lesse belov'd. ZAIDA. It seemeth then, He loves you very much. FATIMA. I can't expresse it: He lives but for me, breatheth but for me: I am the sole original of his good Or evill fortune: when he sees me not, He is in torments, and when hazard brings me Vnto his sight, again, I have great cause To fear that he might die with sudden joy; Lastly if any truth be in his oaths, All other beauties are contemptible to him. ZAIDA. Oh Heaven! what hear I, where am I? oh traitor! Ingratefull wretch!â aside. But could you so soon love him Before yov knew him? FATIMA. I cannot be blam'd For this quick love, I saw in him at first All things that might induce a maid to love: Besides heerein I execute the order My Father doth ordain, I willingly Obey his will; and since he hath chosen him For son in law and for support, I think That he is worthy of it, and conform My self unto him. ZAIDA. But what are your thoughts Of Adibar? Adibar. I dare not to pretend To her pass'd goodness more. Fatima. He deserv'd not The honour of my love; he changed first, And I change at my turn. ZAIDA. He was not alwaies Vnworthy to please you; can you forget him? Fatima. Yes, and with much justice, and reason too, He is to me the most ingratefull person Vpon the earth; his contempt was unjust, But mine is not so. Let us cease to speak Of that inconstant Lover; I will pay him Hatred for hatred, contempt for contempt. Let us again talk of our mariage, And let me know if I may have the honour To see you there, ZAIDA. Excuse me, I'm oppress'd With a great pain, which is redoubled Since your discourse, so that I'm rendered Incapable to be present there, and am Enforc'd to quit you at this very instant. ADIBAR. I wait you; suffer me to pay the service I owe you.â He leads her by the arm? ZAIDA, I am forced through my weaknes To accept your support. Exeunt Zaida &amp; Adibar SCENE VII. FATIMA, CHARIFA. FATIMA, Zaida feels my discase, but Adibar Flies me; herein my revenge is compleat, Though my hope be destroyd. Charifa. You have lost nothing By that, Almansor's worth a thousand of him FATIMA. Iudge better of my plaint, what I have said Is but a fiction; I perceive Medina And thou are intimate, she could not chuse But tell thee that Almansor's very dear To the ingratefull Zaida, this I heard From thy own mouth. Charifa. Well. Fatima. This devise of mine, In feigning that Almansor was to marry me, Is to revenge me of her for admitting, Contrary to her promise, my false Lover To addresse courtship to her, and to punish her For the evills which she hath procured me. Charifa. How cunning are you! this deccit is notable. SCENE VIII. ADIBAR FATIMA FATIMA. How! quit so soon the object of your heart? Adibar. I studied more her rest then my content. Fatima. You appear seised with an extream sadnes. Adibar. I cannot see that suffer which I love. Without grief: Fatima. Zaida sure, repulsed you. ADIBAR. My respect only put me of, and not Her cruelty, Fatima. If she were just, or generous She would despise a lover that's unfaithfull. ADIBAR. I were to blame, if I should complain of her. Fatima. Almansers fortune is more sweet with me. Adibar. I'm to well satisfied, to be jealous of it. Fatima. You do but flatter you with a vain hope, Zaida hath but disdain, and hate for you. Adibar. Her hate and her disdain are ended now; And our hearts speedily shall be united By mariage. Fatima. But Sir, you may be mistaken In your accompt, and hope; do you not know That Zaida's promis'd? Adibar. Rather you may be Deceived in this point: perhaps you know not That he who was to marry her, is dead. Fatima. How is he dead? Adibar. Yes Madam, and fair Zaida Propitious at last, will render justice To my devout affection, and did Assure me when I took my leave of her That she would marry me, if I could get Her brother to consent unto't; adiew; To obtain this so dear and pretious Beauty, I must addresse me to her brother, and Solicit my best friends.â Exit Adibar. SCENE IX. FATIMA, CHARIFA. FATIMA. What have I done? Alas! my fiction hath only serv'd To dispose Zaida to deprive me of My Lover. Charifa. Madam.â Fatima. Leave me; in a fate So sad as this, every thing hurts, destroyes, And makes me desperate. CHARIFA, Will you not hear me? Fatima. No, I hear nothing but the fury which Raigns in my confus'd spirits, grief seiseth me And anger doth transport me. CHARIFA. Madam, comfort you. Fatima. Oh that I were dead! cease to comfort me In such a just despair put me to bed, Or in my grave there to lye buried. The End of the fourth Act.</field>

In this misfortune I had so much judgment To hide this our dishonour, and her rape: By the advice of the illustrious, And wise Gomella, I spread every where The rumour of her death, and sent thee order At the same time to depart from Tremissa And to come heer: lastly in Tunis staying Thy comming, I passed an unknown life In tears and lamentation: and seeing The time of thy return to be at hand, I came heer to this fatall residence: I find thee, and my grief is charm'd already, To see my just rage in thy soule imprinted, And thy brave arm dispos'd to take revenge, And to deprive that wretch of life, who hath Deprived us of honour. Almaosor. Oh how many Afflictions seise! my heart! Lindarache. Tis time to punish, Not to deplore, in such a fatall fortune Expresse thy grief by bloody brave effects Of rage and courage, vain regrets, and sighs Suit with my sex, revenge belongs to thee. Thou knowest the offender, go repair Th'offence: I would not have reserv'd for thee Th'Imployment, if I could revenge my self Without thee; and I had already seen The punishment of Zegry, If I would Have us d Gomellas service; thy arm only Must wash the stam of from thy brow; take all The reuenge to thee, as th'affront's all thine: Seeme no more until thou hast reveng'd Thy Sister, Goe, seek, find and punish fully Her barbarous ravisher; adiew, perform Thy duty, and make thy self to appear A worthy branch of that illustrions stock Of Heros, from whose loines thou art desc?ded; To end our common miseries and fears, Go thou to shed blood, I goe to shed tears.â Exit Lindarache. SCENE II. ALMANSOR alone. Almansor. Oh heard extremitics! oh cruel violence! Alas! the friend that doth oblige me, is The enemy that wrongs me; I owe then My safety unto him that robs me of My honour, ?d the man that sav'd the brother Hath ruined the Sister! in this case What counsell should I take? shall I become Ingratefull, or be infamous, shal I Break the bond of a holy amity? Shal I let forth the blood which preserv'd mine, That blood in which love will that I have Interest? And to say all, the blood of my fair Mistresse? She comes forth, and without doubt aymeth here Honour will that I fly, but Love restrains me: SCENE III. Almansor, Zaida, Medina. ZAIDA. He dares not to advance, his crime intimidates him. We will passe by the traitor, without speaking A word. ALMANSOR. Deare object of all my affections, Charme of my Spirits! ZAIDA. Surely, you are mistaken. You would speak to some other. ALMANSOR. Suffer me T'expresse my passion unto your faire eyes, Love,â ZAIDA. You take me without doubt for Fatima. ALMANSOR. How for Fatima; this word doth acquaint me Confusedly with the unjust suspition From whence this chang springs: possibly you have Believed that I seck to please her, seeing The league that it between me, and her Father; But Heaven, and Love my conquerour, be witnes, That your fair Image wholy doth possesse My heart, that to remove you thence, Fatima Is altogether incapable, that I look on Al that is lovely in her without love And that as sensible only of the darts Of your rare beauties, I confine my thoughts And actions to civilities for her. ZAIDA. How do you look upon Fatima then With an indifference?âLet me see how far His impudence will go.â aside. ALMANSOR. Can you doubt of it? you that have tied all My senses with such sweet and pressing bonds? Can you suspect with any justice, Madam My heart of treachery, my oaths of falshood, And believe that my soul hath so much blacknes, As to betray my Mistresse, my friend, And my Deliverer? could you imagine, Without being deceiv'd, that having once Beheld you, one could love elsewhere? oh no: For me to be inflam'd with a new fire You are too charming, and I'm too much charm'd. ZAIDA, Too much charm'd, monster of perfidiousnes? Wilt thou abuse me then after thou hast Betray'd me, and with an unworthy love Carried away, wilt thou join impudence To infidelity? ALMANSOR. To infidelity, What say you, Zaida? this discourse confounds me. ZAIDA. I see it plainly, wretch; wer't thou lesse wicked, Thou would'st be lesse confounded; an ingratefull Still blusheth at reproaches. ALMANSOR. An ingratefull? ZAIDA. Doth that word trouble thee? and fearest thou The name of an ingratefull person more Then foul ingratitude it self? ALMANSOR. I know not The eause of this your anger, should I never So much examine me, I still should find My conscience innocent. ZAIDA. In thy accompt then Tis nothing to deceive a maid, to wrong Thy friend, to fail thy faith, to love Fatima, Lastly Almansor, I, say you? ZAIDA, Yes, thee. ALMANSOR. Oh! believe me, I love her not. ZAIDA. Dar'st thou to say it yet? Dost thou not love her when thou dost adore her? Thy false equivocations cannot heer Abuse me, I know that thou art to morrow To marry her. AlmansoR. To matry her! o Heaven, believe it not, I swear. Zaida, No, no, forbeare, I believe not The oaths of one that's perjur'd, every one, Knows of this mariage, ALMANSOR. Who told it you? ZAIDA. A certaine person. ALMANSOR. Whosoe'r it be, That certain person ly'd. Tell me his name, And my just anger presently shall carry him The reward of his false intelligence. ZAIDA. Goe punish then Fatima, it was she Her self that told it me. ALMANSOR. Oh give lesse credit, Adorable Wonder, to such false discourses. ZAIDA. Good God! who ever saw such impudence? ALMANSOR. The mariage which she hath forged, is A falsity; bear witnesse thou dread Master Of Heaven that this I speak is truth; but if I lie, let thy hand with a thunderbolt Strike me unto the center of the earth: Let my name be foreuer odious, If the fire which I feel proceedeth not Wholy from your fair eyes, and if my heart Ever conceived for Fatima any thing Beyond a weak esteem. Zaida. I must sift yet This brazen face more throughly.â aside. How wilt thou prove The truth of thy assertion? Almansor, I can produce. A hundred proofs to disabuse you presently. ZAIDA. I'l have but one, and that too very easie; To put an end to the suspitions, Which I've c?ceiv'd of thee, give me forthwith Both thy hand and thy faith. ALMANSOR. I give it you With an excesse of yoy.âbut what would I, Give her a hand that must destroy her brother, And plung it self in his most noble blood?â aside ZAIDA. What dost thou answer me so ill for such Rare bounties? dost thou murmur to thy selfe, Grow pale and study, as if thou resent'st ill What I propose. ALMANSOR. Madam, clean contrary I was rap'd with th'unexpected honour, And happines wherewith I saw me filled, And th'excesse of my joy transported me: I feare through my obedience to betray you, To make detraction to speak against you, And to treat Zegry too unciviliy In giving without his consent my hand And faith; but this weak fear yeilds to my flame Duty prevails not now upon my soul, And cannot take from me the glorious purpose Of giving you my heart and hand together. ZAIDA. Thou thinkest on't too late, my mind is chang'd, And n'er shall ch?ge again, know that I feign'd, Only to try thee, that excesse of goodnes, And thy fires for Fatima presently Burst forth. ALMANSOR. Oh! I had never any for her! ZAIDA. Thy deceit's plain enough, I'm very well Assured of this fatall mariage: When I press'd thee to passe thy faith unto me, I faw that thy remorses for Fatima Accused thee, and thy confusion Confirmed me in my belieft that she Receiv'd the faith which I demanded of thee. ALMANSOR. I offer it unto you. ZAIDA. No thou caust not Dispose of it. Thou hast already given it, And wilt abuse me. ALMANSOR. You abuse your self Wiih too much warines. ZAIDA. Hast thou the boldnes To reply yet? Go, go to thy Fatima, To morrow is your mariage day, I know it. She hath affections for thee, since thou hast Refused me. ALMANSOR. Hear me, I do beseech you. ZAIDA, No, no? that were too great a weaknes in me: Know that I leave thee, n'er too see thee more. A secret poison's hid in the discourse Of an Ingratefull person, and each word A traitor speaks, destroys worse then the sword. Exit Zaida. SCENE IV. Almansor, alone. ALMANSOR. Strange successe, this! How is my soul possess'd Still with new troubles? must I suffer then The punishment of a fault which I have not Committed? when revenge doth presse me to Destroy a friend, must I at the same time Destroy a Mistresse too? must I lose Zaida? Yes my heart, I must loose her presently, Since in depriving her of a dear brother, My arm will draw her hate and anger on me: I should hence forth no longer be so soft, Tis time to think of Zegrys death, he must Pay his blood to repair the honour which He robs me of. This Enemy so dear Must die, and I must sacrifice him to me; He comes: at his approach some t?der motions Oppose my just resentments, and indeed Render them weak, my friendship combateth The anger that possesseth me, my tendernes Is lesse weak, and my fury is lesse strong. He sav'd my life, he ravished my Sister; Shall I go to embrace him, or to kill him? SCENE V. ZEGRY, ORMIN, ALMANSOR. ZEGRY. At last I've met with him that wr?geth me. Ormin leave us alone. ORMIN. I will retire me. Into this thicket secretly to see What passeth, I doubt there will be a quarrel: âaside. Almansor. You appear troubled. ZEGRY. I've much cause to be so. Almansor: What troubles you so much? ZEGRY. A wretch, a Traytor, Whose crime gives me an infinite regret, And doth deserve more then a single death To punish it. Almansor. May I serve you herem? ZEGRY. Yes, I can't finish my revenge without thee. Almansor. Zegry, you can dispose of all my blood. ZEGRY. It is an offer which I can't refuse. ALMANSOR. Who is th'affronter? ZEGRY. Thou art extream bold: Know st thou not, traitor, that it is thy self? Almansor. I? ZEGRY, Thou; n'er seem to wonder at the thing. Only defend thy felf. ALMANSOR embracing him. Almansor. How much am I. Indebted to thee for this sudden passion, Tis now the chief point of thy amity: Thy anger doth oblige me, though it wr?gs me. I had already in my heart resolu d The design of thy death, and justly too: My arm was ready for it, when inspight Of all my fury, at thy first approach My heart grew tender, and had been reduc'd To balance the fierce darts which I had level'd Against thee, if thy furious transport Had not call'd home my choler unto me, And banished my tendernes. ZEGRY. Il hear No more discourse, once again guard thy self AlmansoR. So fierce a fight can't but be sweet unto me Hononr solicits me more justly to it Then thee, but let me know at least the cause That doth provoke thee; I will make it plainly appear that thou complainest wrongfully, And justify my self in Killing thee. ZEGRY. How! feignst thou to be ignorant, and instead Of making a confession, dost thou threaten me? Thy base crime groweth greater by thy boldnes. ALMANSOR. Let me at Iast know what that base crime is. ZEGRY. Consult thy conscience, and thou shalt know it, It will instruct thee that wirh a false heart In recompense of all my kindnes to thee Thou rob'st me of my Mistresse, and that Through treacheries which cannot be excus'd, Thou art to marry her to morrow privately. Almansor. If I am criminall, assure thy self, It is not in this point: I never did Look on Fatima with desires of love; Only thou mayst reproach my heart for having Sight for thy Sister without thy consent. ZEGRY. How! dost thou love her? Almansor. No, no, it would be An extream errour, I say, I adore her, I dare not say I love her. That which I Resent now for her beauties doth surpasse The thing that's called Love. ZEGRY. By this confession, Dear friend, thou hast restored life unto me. My griefs and troubles now are waited on By an excesse of pleasure; Zaida is Too happy, and her thoughts could never hope A more illustrious husband: she is free. The Lover unto whom I gave my word, Hath seen his destiny determined By death, and my repose shall fully be Setled to meet a brother in the person Of my most deare friend. Almansor. What thou offerest me Should be most dear unto me; but dost thou Know him whom thou mak st choice of for thy brother? ZEGRY. I think, I doe; thy country is Tremissa, Thy name, Almansor, and thy family Is noble and illustrious; and if I May believe thee, thy greatest glory is To be my friend. Almansor. Thou know st me but by half yet; I was born heer, and born thy enemy, More then one just and honest motive doth Engage me to thy ruine; not to hold thee Long in suspence, I am Abencerage. ZEGRY. Abencerage. Ormin. O Heaven!â aside. Almansor. That wotd doth tell thee. Our difference, and my duty. ZEGRY. I aswell Know as thy self the mutuall hatred which In our two houses seemes almost as twere To be immortall; but thy blood which now Thou owest to my succour, should for me Stop the course of it in thy soul; and though My friendship seems to stagger on this point, I will content my self to hate thy name, And love thy person. Yes, pursue thy love Vnto my Sister; by a mariage We may be tied with new knots, and by That holy flame, the irreligious heat Of that so old, and fatal enmity, Will be extinct. Almansor. This mariage would be sweet, But I can't think of it till by thy death I have reveng'd my selfe upon thee. ZEGRY. How! Almanlor. It is not that which thou believ'st provokes me, Thy name I hate not, but I hate thy person, And I cannot but in thy blood repair The wrong which thou hast done me. ZEGRY. I? Almansor. Yes, Thou. How ill thou actest the astonished, Thy base crime groweth greater by thy boldnes. ZEGRY. Let me at last know what that base crime is. Almansor. Consult this letter, read, and thou shalt know it. ZEGRY. reads. You, from whom I derive my birth, Know that a sad fate worse then death Is hapned to me; all our name In my losse bear an equall shame; The false and cruel Zegry is The Authour of my miseries, For he it is that by his charms Hath taken me out of your arms. Zelinda. ORMIN. Without doubt they will both mistake themselves. ZEGRY. I cannot comprehend this dark Ãnigma. Almansor. It is too plain to me here that my sister Zelinda giveth us to understand That thou art her base ravisher. ZEGRY. Canst thou Suspect me of so foule an action? ALMANSOR. Canst thou deny it, traitor? and can I Believe it? ZEGRY. Hear me but a word or two. ALMANSOR. It would be to no purpose, guard thy self, I'l hear no more. ZEGRY. How! dares the man that ows me His life, to assault mine? ALMANSOR. That obligation Cannot divert me from my just reveng: Thou wronght'st my safety, and my sisters rape, And so much as life is lesse dear then honour, So much an affront which reflects upon it, Carries it in my soul upon a benefit, And I am lesse afraid to be ingratefull, Then to be infamous; but let us leave Discourse, and come to action. ZEGRY. Stay, Ingratefull, Stay yet a little. ORMIN. Help, oh help; SCENE VI. And the last, Adibar, Zaida, Medina, Alabez, Lindarache, Gomella, Fatima, Charifa, Almansor, Zegry, Ormin, GASUL. Zaida. What noise Is this I heare? Lindarache. What rumour is rais'd up? Adiber. Hold, hold! Lindarache. No, no, go on, My son, finish thy work. Gomella. Their quarrel, Adibar, Cannot be taken up, therefore let's leave it To be decided. Adiber. No, such a third person As I, shall never suffer them to fight, And to look on. Gomella. Well then, defend your selfe. We't fight all four. Ormin to Almansor. Ormin. Oh! brother rather lift Your arm up against me, I'in guilty only, Zegry is innocent, Lindarache. Whom do I see? Ormin. you see Zelinda your unfortunate Daughter, Who left your family to follow Zegry; And who in changing fate and habit only, Could not enforce her soul to the least change: My heart which was pleased in slavery By him, forgat it self in following. Somwhat too constantly this fleeting Lover; But having known him to be taken with Another Object, I feard in discovering My self, to draw upon me his contempt, And would still suffer the same violence, If his own interest brake not my silence. Linderachi. Oh, Daughter! Almansor. Oh! my Sister! Zegry. Fair Zelinda, Revenge your self, I mourn you, I accuse My self, and yeild my bosome to your stroak. Ormin. Zegry, You need not to fear any thing From my resentments, if you pitty me, I am not to be pittied. ZEGRY. I blush That after so much goodness as you have Expressed to me, I have but one soul Too give you; and is the consent of your Parents and friends will be propitious to us, There's nothing can impede our mariage. Lindarache. This mariage is the chief of all my wishes. ALMANSOR. Friend, thou canst make me happy too, thy Sister Dependeth on thee, thou know'st, I adore her. ZEGRY. I offered her uuro thee, a while since, And now I do again with height of ioy. ZAIDA. All my suspitions are extinguished, And you must know that following my duty. I follow my desires; but Adibar Will complain of it. Adibar. Madam, y'are deceiv'd, When I lose all hope, I lose all my flame: And to expresse unto you that I do not Resent it, I will sacrifice my heart In flames of loue to that fair Saint, for whom I burned formerly; Gomella. may I Hope your incomparable Daughter? Gomella. Adibar, My family is honoured by your choice. Fatima, take your husband from my hand. Fatima. Such pleasing orders I shall willingly Obey. ZEGRY. Come, let us go unto the MosquÃ¨ Together, to give thanks unto the goodnes Of Heaven that set an end to our misfortunes, And made appear by this happy suecesse, That one may be ingrate, yet generous.
