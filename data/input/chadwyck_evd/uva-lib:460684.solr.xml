      <field name="fulltext">THE DAUGHTER OF ST. MARK. The following extract furnishes a warranty for this title:— “In order to satisfy the rigid law, which forbade the marriage of any Venetian of noble birth with a foreigner, the destined royal bride was solemnly adopted by the State, and declared a Daughter of St. Mark: she was then married by proxy, in the presence of the Doge and Signory, conducted by the Bucentaur, to the galley which awaited her in the port, and escorted by a squadron of ships of war, with becoming pomp, and a portion of 100,000 ducats, to the territories of her husband.”—Sketches of Vetian History vol. ii., p. 124. NOTICE. The history of Catarina Cornaro has been recently selected by four composers of distinction, as a fitting subject for the occupation of their talents—viz.: Herr Lachner, in Germany; Monsieur Halévy, in France; Signor Donizetti, in Italy; and Mr. Balfe, in England—on the present occasion. The poem of the eminent French Dramatist, my most esteemed friend, M. de Saint Georges, is the work on which I have based a portion of this Opera, and the remainder, like many parts of his splendid Drama, is mere fiction. The language, I need scarcely add, is my own. I was apprehensive of introducing any representation of those fearful events which signalized Cyprus in 1473, and which, while forcefully delineated by the pen of this able writer, and through that medium too faithfully imitated on the Parisian stage, are repugnant to the taste of an English audience. M. de Saint Georges has annexed the following remarks to his poem, relative to the history of Catarina Cornaro, collated from P. Daru's Histoire de la Republique de Venise, vol ii., p. 482:— “Jean de Lusiguan, plus connu sous le nom de Jean III., roi de Chypre, était un prince faible, gouverné par sa femme Hélène Paléologue. Il n' était issu de leur marriage qu'une fille, unie à Jean de Portugal qui résidait dans l'ile de Chypre. Mais un fils naturel du roi, le prince Jacques de Lusignan, doué d' un esprit actif et entreprenant, effraya tellement l'ambitieuse Hélène par ses prétentions au trône, qu' elle obtint du roi qu'il fut ordonné prêtre, et nommé archevêque de Nicosie, métropole de l' ile. A cette époque, se trouvait à la cour de Chypre un patricien de Venise nommé Andréa Cornaro. “Ce seigneur ayant fait voir au prince Jacques le portrait de sa nièce, Catarina Cornaro, et remarquant la vive impression que causait au fils du roi l' image de cette belle personne, lui conseilla de se faire relever de ses vœux, de s'unir à Venise en épousant la fille d' un des sénateurs de la république, et de réclamer le secours et l'appui des Vénitiens pour succéder à son père qui venait de mourir. “Le prince accuellit cet espoir avec empressement. Andréa Cornaro fut le négociateur de toute cette intrigue. Charlotte de Portugal, qui avait hérité du trône de son père, Jean de Lusignan, fut chassée par les Vénitiens de son royaume et se sauva dans l' ile de Rhodes. “Catarina Cornaro apporta une riche dot à Jacques de Lusignan, élu roi de Chypre. Le ler juin 1469, la jeune reine fit son entrée dans l ile de Chypre sur une escadre vénitienne, conduite par Andrea son oncle. Le sénat de Venise déclara Catarina fille de Saint-Marc.” The subject is also thus referred to, in An Italian Voyage, by Richard Lassels, 1698, part ii., p. 231:— “The kingdom of Cyprus came to the Venetians by Catherine Cornaro, who was made heir of it by her son, the king thereof, who died young, and without issue. The story is this, Catherine was daughter of Marco Cornaro, and neece of Andrew Cornaro, two noblemen of Venice. Andrew was sent Auditoré General into the kingdom of Cyprus, in the time of James, king of that island, and helped to him many thousand crowns. One day, as the king was talking familiarly with him, he let fall (whether by chance or design) a little picture in miniature, of a very handsome lady. The king, curious to see it, called for it civilly, and viewing it well, fell hugely in love with the original of it, which Andrew assured him to be far handsomer than the copy; and, withal added, that if his Majesty liked her, she was his neece, and that, therefore, he offered her freely to him for his wife, with all the money he had already lent him, and an hundred thousand crowns more. The king bit willingly at these two baits, beauty and money, and was not quiet until he married her.” I am aware that the construction of this Drama is open to a charge of “utter disregard of time and space;” but a deviation from the unities having been sanctioned by our most eminent Dramatists, and by their great master, in his immortal tragedy of Othello on the very same scene of action where this opera lies, I am not without hope that so humble a follower as myself may be forgiven. Having been repeatedly blamed, by the ablest critics of the public press, for introducing dialogue in my other Operas, I have determined on presenting, for the first time, one entirely in recitative. The passages to which inverted commas will be found prefixed, are omitted in representation. A. BUNN. London, November 27th, 1844.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —Festal Hall in the Villa Andréa—In the back ground a terrace, at the foot of which runs the Brenta—on the O. P. side a large staircase and gallery, leading to the apartments of Catarina—and on the P. S. the balcony to the terrace which overlooks the surrounding country—two large doors O. P. and P. S. chair on P. S. Enter Catarina down the stairs O. P. Recitative. There is a fond delight much dearer far Than all our other raptured moments are; 'Tis when we picture more than we possess, And fancy coming joys can ne'er be less: When hope unto our earliest feelings brings That charm to which the heart with fervor clings, And which, when broken other ties it nurst, It owns the longest, as it knew the first. That hope is mine, for Adolphe here to-day, My vows with vows as faithful will repay; And on the holy shrine that pledge renew, By him declared, by me received, as true. Ado. (exclaiming outside the balcony) Catarina. Cat. 'Tis he! Adolphe singing without. Serenade. There's sunlight in heaven, There's calm on the sea; Perfume on the flower, And bloom on the tree: With nature as beaming, As beauty can be, And all around smiling, Oh smile thou on me! “With fondness unfading, “With pinion as free “As bird that hath wandered “Flies home o'er the lea: “With spirit as ardent, “As feeling can be; “And its passion renewing, “I come love to thee.” Catarina, running up to Adolphe, who enters at the P. S. door. Recitative. Adolphe! mine own Adolphe— Ado. —My best beloved, From whom one thought an instant ne'er hath roved; My bosom's hope, my heart's delight and pride, With whom each wish alone I would divide. Cat. Adolphe! my husband— Ado. —Ah! unto my heart, That sacred name a transport doth impart, The joy 'tis linked with through my soul doth thrill, And all its vows I hasten to fulfil. Duet. (Ensemble) Be this moment the brightest, That love hath yet known; And its sorrows the lightest O'er love that have flown. Thou art mine! thou art mine! As mine arms round thee twine, “Oh! whose wish would not give for “Such treasure a throne; “When we feel that we live for “One fond heart alone. “Thou art mine! thou art mine!” Ado. The hour is come that union now to see, Which makes us happy while it leaves us free; Free to select a home, to bid farewell To one I seek no longer in to dwell; Where plots by tyranny at freedom hurled, Have rendered Venice hateful to the world. Cat. (with a feeling of reproof) My Adolphe, bear in mind this spot of earth, Is that which gave thy Catarina birth. Ado. Thy land no longer! mine with open arms Would give full welcome to such priceless charms— France now adopts thee.— Cat. —Cans't thou then forget The scenes we've lived in, and where first we met; The place—with spell to me all spell above— Where first I listened to thy words of love? Cavatina. Ado. As the fair world I traversed, The same 'twere to me, What the peril surrounding Where honor might be: And thus, guided by Fortune. Thy young cavalier, Though he sought glory elsewhere, Found happiness here. The chain thy beauty's weaving, The sigh thy breast is heaving, The look so bashful shining Which yields without repining, Despite thy vain endeavour, Make thee mine, and for ever. Solo. Cat. The home I loved so, leaving, O'er those I loved there grieving, I quit with fate unshrinking, Of that tie only thinking Which, while fate cannot sever, Make thee mine, and for ever! Solo. Ado. Ah! the bright land I cling to Will welcome me more, When this treasure I bring to Her well-beloved shore. For, thus guided by Fortune, Her young cavalier, Though he sought glory elsewhere, Found happiness here. Cat. Can deed or language bind me more to thee? Ado. My happiness and fame shall thine achievement be. Cat. (Ensemble) The home I loved so leaving, O'er those I loved there grieving, I quit with faith unshrinking. Of that tie only thinking, Which, while fate cannot sever, Makes thee mine and for ever. Ado. (Ensemble) The chain, her beauty's weaving, The sigh her breast is heaving, The look so bashful shining, Which yields without repining, Despite her vain endeavour, Make her mine, and for ever. At the end of this ensemble, enter Andréa at O. P. door, who crosses, and comes between Adolphe and Catarina. And. (to Adolphe) My noble Adolphe, whom this morning's rite Will with those honors which are mine unite; I bid thee welcome here—(then to Catarina) my much loved child, Around that cheek, which long hath sweetly smiled, Now smiles, as charged with peace and beauty play, In fond approval of this joyous day. Ado. When once my name with thine allied shall be, For all thou dost confer, My arm, my blood, my life, I give to thee— My hand and heart to her. Trio. Ado. &amp; Cat. (to Andréa) (Ensemble) To those whose wisdom is the guiding star Of this happy day, Two hearts with gratitude o'erflowing are A tribute to pay. And. (Ensemble) To thee who looketh from thy realm, afar On this happy day, My thoughts with gratitude o'erflowing are All homage to pay. [In the execution of this trio Andréa crosses to P. S., and Adolphe and Catarina get towards O. P., during the last few bars, Moncenigo has ascended the Terrace, and taken up a fixed position near the P. S. column. And. (aside, and alarmed at seeing Moncenigo.) One of the Council placed within my halls! His hated presence every sense appals— Some strange mysterious purpose brings him here, To awe with wonder, or to chill with fear. (turns to Adolphe) Now, haste thee, Adolphe—hasten to complete This day's great purport—we again will meet Beneath this roof, and consecrate a scene Bright as have any in its annals been. (to Catarina) Go, gentle girl, and standing by thy side Him of whose house thou long hast been the pride, Thou shalt in all his tried affection see, Confirming acts but promised yet to thee. [Adolphe conducts Catarina to the O. P. staircase, by which she returns to her apartments, and he, wrapping his cloak around him, exit at P. S. door, when Moncenigo comes down the stage to Andréa. Mon. Are we alone? And. We are—your purpose speak— And why unbidden thus my halls you seek? Mon. Here from the secret Ten, assembled now, I come—their stated object to avow— To give a message sent by their decree, Alike important to the state and thee! And. (aside, in alarm) The ten in council! horror chills my veins, Whose heart no more its wonted calm sustains. (to Moncenigo) Proceed! Mon. Adolphe de Courcy, to your niece they say Betrothed is, and will wedded be— And. To-day. Mon. Wilt thou obey the council? second, too, The lofty projects which they have in view? To the republic such assistance lend, As Venice looks for when she needs a friend? And. I hear you, sir— Mon. —then acting with the law, Which holds her subjects, as her foes, in awe; And speaking firmly, Venice, by my voice, Bids thee annul this marriage of thy choice! And. Ah! do I hear aright? or do I dream Of things which, waking, I should madness deem? Annul this marriage, violate that bond, Which given once, I prize my life beyond? All ties of feeling thus asunder tear, And bring down hearts, now happy, to despair! To heap upon these hairs— Mon. —The state demands This sacrifice—a great one—at thy hands! To her thine honour doth belong, of right, As doth thy life blood in the hour of fight. And. And wouldst thou have me violate a vow By me and others sacred held till now; With shame my cheek, with grief my soul to charge, And make me hated by the world at large? Never! such outrage Venice would disown; My life is her's—mine honor is mine own. [Andréa crosses to P. S. and leans on the back of the arm-chair. Mon. In lieu of a stranger, a young knight of France, Who neither thy fortune nor state can advance; An offer so brilliant as that which I bring, Thy pride cannot question— And. —I would, wert a King! Mon. (coldly) 'Tis a King— And. —What word now breaks upon mine ear? One, but for other views, 'twere pride to hear. An empire at my feet, my name enrolled With lofty lineage, and achievement bold; But 'tis a vain regret, and why repine O'er dreams of greatness which can ne'er be mine? Mon. The task, however sad or stern, 'Tis mine to speak, Thine is, the end proposed to learn— The truth to seek. Listen! Cyprus has chosen from her shores to chase The high descendant of her kingly race— And Venice ready, in the hour of need, To crush the wrong and bid the right succeed, Would fain the cause of Lusignan espouse In the last scion of that mighty house. And. Well!— Mon. —Though proscribed by them, yet we have shown A fixed resolve to keep him on the throne, And with intent their malice to defeat, That compact of alliance to complete, And bind each state together, Venice now Hath chosen him a wife, upon whose brow The crown of Cyprus once again shall blaze In all the splendour of its brightest days; And having deemed thee loyal, found thee frank, It is THY NIECE she raises to this rank! And. Can it be possible? Mon. On thy consent The council are, in full reliance, bent. And. (aside) The wife of Lusignan! of Cyprus' King! Ne'er on my house may chance such grandeur bring! Mon. (solemnly to Andréa) Relying on thy prudence, now I go, Soon to return, thy choice, and fate, to know— Reflect, while Venice seeks to make thee great, She can revenge an insult to her state: Think not my words are of unmeaning breath— One hour resolves thy glory—or—thy death! [Moncenigo exit at the P. S. door, and Andréa takes C. of stage. And. What's to be done? on one side glory stands, To welcome me and mine with open hands; The power, however fleeting, of a throne, Splendour, my house, though noble, ne'er hath known. Upon the other seems a gulph to yawn, For two young hearts, whose hopes are in their dawn A length'ning sorrow, undefined despair, At once, and ever, 'tis their doom to bear: While in the distance, fixed upon my fate, The council now their victim's answer wait. Here two Pages enter on the terrace by the P. S. stairs. This way the crowd are bending, come to see How happy hearts, without a grief, can be; Hence let me fly, and let me keep unshewn To others anguish felt by me alone! [Andréa exit by the P. S. door, while the Pages make a sign for the company to enter by the P. S. staircase, viz. the Ladies of the Corps de Ballet, who immediately range themselves on the P. S. side, up to the great staircase there —then Noblemen, and Vassals who take up a position behind the Ladies, Esquires, attended by their Grooms, occupy the terrace, one passing down to place the arm chair in order on the P. S. side—the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Court, friends of Andréa, enter at the same time by the P. S. door, and station themselves, on that side the stage. Four Pages enter from Catarina's apartment O. P. and place themselves each side of the staircase there—when Catarina, attended by her Bridesmaids, enters therefrom, and descends the staircase. Chorus, on the entry of Catarina. As pure in ray As early day, Is the vestal beam which lighteth The sacred flame Of woman's fame. When her bridal vow she plighteth. There is no guile Within her smile, Which in maiden beauty shineth; Chaste as a star, That from afar Its light round the earth entwineth. [These ladies remain on the O. P. while Catarina, crossing to the Nobles on the P. S. side, makes them a profound reverence, which they return, when she crosses back to the Bridesmaids. Adolphe, accompanied by his noble friends, enters by the P. S. staircase, preceded by the Banner of De Courcy. Chorus, on the entry of Adolphe. In manhood's bloom With helm and plume, In his pride the chief advanceth— Though love would seem The raptured theme To which still his light heart danceth! His manly form, In calm or storm, All its wonted nerve retaineth, Firm as the rock, In tempest's shock, Which its hold unmoved maintaineth! [Adolphe, then presenting her to his friends who again return her curtsey, he conducts her to the chair placed for her on the P. S. side—her ladies follow her and stand around; she being seated. Adolphe's friends surround him, he being seated on Catarina's right—the four Pages remain on the O. P. staircase, and the others place themselves by the two large columns—the ladies of the Corps de Ballet present Catarina with bouquets, which are taken by her and her Bridesmaids—passing behind the gentlemen on the O. P. and then in front of those on the P. S. and regaining their original places. When all are grouped at the end of this second chorus, begins. THE DIVERTISSEMENT. And as soon as the Divertissement is finished, an Officer of the Household is seen to make his way from the P. S. stairs through the crowd, and to come down the stage. Officer (to Adolphe and Catarina.) The altar is prepared, the incense burns, And to the shrine the bidden beadsman turns. [Exit Officer at P. S. stairs. Full Chorus. Let every voice swell high To the realms of the vaulted sky! Chorus of Men. And the hearts of the brave shall be Enrolled in the cause of chivalry. Chorus of Women. While love's more gentle lay It's melody shall play! Full Chorus. May Fortune's star preside O'er the chieftain and his bride! Quartette. Happy hearts, fond and fair Be your young days! May ye ne'er feel the care Which the world sways! And when Time plumes his flight O'er ye at last, May his wing sweep as light As if ne'er past! And should grief ever mar Scenes that so lovely are, Hope shall still dash afar Clouds o'er ye cast! (Ensemble) Happy hearts, fond and fair Be your young days! May ye ne'er feel the care Which the world sways! Ado. (offering his hand to Catarina) Mine own beloved one, let us not delay One moment more the rapture of this day. Cat. (with uneasiness) But where is Andréa?—one to both so dear! Our joy were wanting, unless he were here. Ado. (to Catarina) Perchance this moment at the holy shrine, True to his word, he waits to make thee mine. Full Chorus. “Ah, well 'twere for Venice, if Venice could see “Each home of her beauty thus happy and free. “Where feelings have power “All envy above; “And the heart they respond to “Breathes nothing but love. “Blest be the hand which unites them for ever, “And curst who the bonds of that union would sever. “There is no human tie “So full of love and truth, “As that one which awakes “The first fond vows of youth. “And well 'twere for Venice, if Venice could see “Each home of her beauty thus happy and free! [Adolphe takes the hand of Catarina, and preceded by the Pages, who have left the O. P. staircase, and followed by the Bridesmaids, Nobles, and the body of guests, has passed round the stage, and is about to go off by the P. S. side, when Andréa, pale and agitated, enters on the terrace by the P. S. staircase. FINALE. And. Hold! stop this marriage; by the words now heard It is my will these rites shall be deferred. (then aside) Deferr'd! this brain will burst, this heart will break, While thus its feelings to their centre shake; (aloud) No! not deferred, for every word I spoke, The pledge I gave ye, I do now revoke. [General movement of the whole group. Catarina, her Maids, and sundry Nobles take up a position on the O. P. side; Adolphe and his friends on the P. S.; Andréa between Catarina and Adolphe; the other Ladies, Nobles, and Pages in the back ground; alarm of all. Solo. Adolphe, Catarina, and Chorus. What mean these words? break off the rites prepared? Defeat the hopes by all so deeply shared? Refuse the vows of honor to maintain, And life's fond ties dissolve at once in twain? To know the cause we seek— Let him speak! let him speak! [Andréa remains silent and absorbed, when Adolphe advances from the P. S. towards him. Ado. Without reproach, or angry thought, Which justly might arise, With mind, a moment overwrought, That now I tranquilize. By friendship's bonds remembered well, By those more dear I feel, The pangs which thus thy bosom swell, In faith to me reveal. And. 'Twere fruitless here such question to resolve, For word and promise, I alike dissolve; Adolphe, farewell, forgive me, and forget The strife we part in, and that e'er we met. Cat. That fate which made thee mine, The tie can sever; Heaven may the knot untwine, But man shall—never! [With this emphatic exclamation, Catarina rushes across to P. S. by the side of Adolphe. Ado. If in some petty plot or state intrigue Thy soul, once noble, condescends to league— If for some shameful motive, unexplained, My country's honor and mine own be stained— That deep affront I will upon this day— Meant to be one of happiness—repay. And. Take all I own, my wealth, my rank, my life, All, saving her, I cannot make thy wife. Ado. And canst thou thus thy solemn oath forswear? Cat. (taking Andrea by her right hand, and pointing to Heaven with her left in a solemn manner. The oath delivered here is sacred there. And. Oh! spare this torture, words are idle all, Vows once inviolate I now recall— A duty both beyond control and will, Whate'er the issue, I must yet fulfil. [At these words Adolphe and his party cross the stage to O. P. leaving Catarina and, her maids on the P. S. The Ladies who had been on the O. P. side ascend the stage and some the O. P. staircase, while the Nobles of Andréa's party, who had been on the O. P. cross over to the P. S., those in the back ground advance two steps. Andréa still keeps in the C. Ado. (to Andréa) (Ensemble) Nought can my fury now assuage— This perjured act to me, Despite my feelings and thine age, Shall soon resented be, Ladies &amp; Nobles (to Andréa) (Ensemble) No words can calm our pride or rage Such perjured act to see, And never doubt, despite thine age, It will resented be. Cat. (Ensemble) Though hearts by honor held in gage No perjured act can free, Better by death this storm assuage, Than thus its victim be. Adolphe's party (to Andréa) (Ensemble) Nought can our fury now assuage This perjured act on thee, Despite all feeling, and thine age, Shall soon resented be. Cat. (with great dignity) Where is thy right, and from what claim derived, To act this part by scheme or fraud contrived? Here before Heaven, whose light doth o'er us shine, Break thine own oath, but bid me not break mine! And. (impressively) The right which thou wouldst question is that power Thy parent gave me in her dying hour; Though from thy mind thou wouldst at once efface All thoughts of him who fills that parent's place, There is a duty which by her was left For thy protection, when of her bereft; And knowing well the web around thee spun, And danger near, that duty shall be done! Andréa, delivering this, firmly towards Catarina. Adolphe and Chorus. False as thyself thy tale, This cheat shall not prevail. Ado. This outrage upon me Shall we resented be. Chorus. By us resented be! Cat. (to Andréa) Aria. From all around apart, Oh, for my sake, On this distracted heart Some pity take! Do not in wilder fears My feelings steep, But dry the burning tears You see me weep. Think how in early days In love we dwelt; And how, with speechless praise, That love I felt! Oh, from these streaming eyes Turn not your sight, Nor let the peace you prize Be broken quite! And. (aside) Oh, grief beyond enduring, When while her life assuring, I rend its dearest tie! Than their regard requiting By their hearts disuniting, 'Twere better far to die. And. and Cat. (Ensemble) Oh, grief beyond enduring, When while my/her life assuring, I rend/He rends its dearest tie! Than his/their regard requiting, By our/their hearts disuniting 'Twere happier/better far to die. Reprise. Ado. (Ensemble) Nought can my fury now assuage— This perjured act to me, Despite my feelings and thine age, Shall soon resented be. Cat. (Ensemble) Though hearts by honor held in gage No perjured act can free, Better by death this storm assuage, Than thus its victim be! Ladies and Nobles. (Ensemble) No words can quell our pride, or rage, Such perjured act to see; And never doubt, despite thine age, It will resented be! Adolphe's friends (to Andréa) (Ensemble) Nought can our fury now assuage, This perjured act on thee, Despite all feeling, and thine age, Shall soon resented be. Towards the last bars of the Finale, when the Music becomes animated, the friends of Adolphe, and the partizans of Andréa, are about to rush upon each other sword in hand, when the Ladies from the back ground interfere between them, keeping back those on the O. P. side, while Catarina restraing those on the P. S. Adolphe prepares to leave the hall, and Catarina, in the agony of her feelings, falls at the feet of Andréa, who turns aside to conceal his tears. TABLEAU. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —The oratory of Catarina. The scene is divided into two compartments. In the front part which goes up to the 2d entrance, is a secret door on the O. P. side, and a smaller one on the P. S. leading to Catarina's apartments, by the side of which is a prie-dieu with a prayer book on it, an arm chair and footstool on the P. S. side, and a square table on the O. P. with a candelabra on it, lighted up. In the inner compartment there is a large centre window opening on a balcony and overlooking the grand canal, with a moonlight view of Venice. There is a door on the O. P. and P. S., a lamp suspended from the ceiling throws a dim light over the room. Catarina is discovered in a recess of the balcony on the P. S. side. Distant Chorus (of Gondoliers.) There's not a sound, however light, To break the calm of gentle night, The latest sigh of morning's gale Hath not a breath to swell our sail, Yet o'er the quiet main The haven we shall gain, For the Madona guides our bark, Whether the sky be bright or dark. [At the end of this chorus, Catarina comes down the stage, takes off her veil, and places it on the arm chair. Barcarole. The Gondolier, to wind and wave His fragile boat confides; Assured the soul that's pure and brave Can stem the rudest tides! While able thus through clime or sea Thy dauntless course to steer, Where thou may'st be, oh, pray for me, Poor Gondolier! The Gondolier, by vesper's chime When bid no more to roam, Contented hails the happy time That wakens thoughts of home— Beneath that roof, on bended knee, With all to thee so dear, When thou shalt be, oh, pray for me, Good Gondolier! Scena (with desperate energy). Oh, when thus they've bereft me Of the only hope left me, And stifled of sorrow the cry, Oh, 'twere best in such anguish Thus no longer to languish, But burst through its torture, and die! [Catarina is about to rush up to the window, when she suddenly stops—hesitates, then sings in a softer tone. Recitative. Forgive me, Heaven, if on this fatal theme Thy sacred edicts I should e'er blaspheme; And, touch'd with pity, mayst thou calm the breast Which those without remorse have thus oppress'd. Oh, see me now in holy prayer Before thine altar kneel, And in oblivion may I there Sweet consolation feel! [She moves slowly towards the prie-dieu, kneels down on it, and, on opening the book of prayers lying on it, she exclaims— Ah! what do I behold? within this page, Whose words should thoughts as pure as them engage, I find this writing traced by Adolphe's pen, To chide, perchance, expressions utter'd then: Whate'er the grief, the joy, the weal, the woe, My trembling bosom now at once would know. Cat. (opens the letter, and reads) At midnight hour, when o'er the lull'd Lagune In peaceful splendour shineth down the moon, If in thy solitude thou chance to hear The mirthful music of the Gondolier, Open thy casement—let no whisper break The calm of night, nor watchful ears awake; And, safely moor'd beneath it, thou shalt see One from thy bondage come to set thee free. Recitative. “Oh, why should I tremble? oh, what can appal me, “When the fond words of Adolphe come hence thus to call me— “The daughter of Venice! Adolphe, thou shalt find “The links of her life with thine own are entwin'd. “I know how to linger if danger be nigh, “To live, to endure, and, if needed, to die, “And I come to thy bidding, whate'er may befal me.” Cab. Oh, what can speak the rapture, can picture the delight We feel, when all that's dear to us once more enchants the sight? He comes to breath again Each well-remember'd word Of that beguiling strain In happier hours I heard; That feeling highly wrought Which once around me cast The heart so loved—it thought For ever it would last! [Listening. Recitative. Is it a bark, which o'er the sleeping tide, With noiseless course so tranquilly doth glide! The truth he will reveal My destiny must seal! 'Tis he—'tis he! He comes to breathe again Each well remembered word Of that beguiling strain In happier hours I heard; That feeling highly wrought, Which, once around me cast, The heart so loved, it thought For ever it would last. [As Catarina is descending the stage, Andréa enters from the P. S. door, and Catarina utters a loud scream on beholding him. Cat. Great Heav'n! And. (with great feeling) The sorrow heap'd on thee Thou may'st believe hath not been caused by me. Think not for thee one grief I could create Without enduring anguish far more great. The act of Venice bad me break mine oath, And brought this scene of sorrow upon both. Thou know'st the might, the vengeance she can wield, To which, in horror, I was forced to yield; And while compelled such rigour to assume, It was to save thee from a darker doom. Cat. He who can read all hearts will thine lay bare, And from its cell each latent secret tear. And. I can before His dread tribunal stand With guileless spirit, and with unstained hand. Alas! thou dost not know what further ill Awaits thy feelings and usurps thy will. 'Tis not enough one cherished heart to break, But Venice wills another thou shalt take. Cat. Another?— And. —Aye, if thou aside can'st fling The thoughts to which thy memory loves to cling, And think no more of plighted faith or vow— To-morrow sees A CROWN upon thy brow. Cat. (with energy) Never !— And. But hear me?— Cat. (forcefully) —I alike despise The threats of Venice and her kingly ties, And though mine own betrothed from me she rends, Yet not on her, nor thee, this hand depends. And. Were it on me alone that Venice sought To pass the outrage she on both has brought, I had all bounds of state or fear o'erleapt, And still my faith beneath her daggers kept; But knowing well the force of her decree, I could not peril him thou lov'st, nor thee! Cat. Adolphe! Though on my doom they now are bent, Oh, what against him can be their intent? And. As from the shrine we can the idol reach, They think through one, that they can master each. (then in a solemn tone) Thou understand'st my words. Oh, slight them not, And Heav'n, that shields the good, watch o'er thy lot! Solo. When all around our path is dreary, And sorrows o'er us sweep— When rest denied is to the weary, And calm to hearts that weep— When those the bitter world neglecteth, But ruin near them see, Then Heaven the innocent protecteth, If pure their spirit be. When friends in their affection falter We deemed before so true And that regard begins to alter Which fond was hitherto; When time, that heals all grief, respecteth, If pure their spirit be. [Exit Andréa, P.S.D. Cat. And can it be? and whom their fury dare To threaten whom, as alien, they should spare? Their chains, their poison, and their prison wall ALarm no more—this night shall end them all— He comes to bear me to that land where those Who love, in peace and freedom can repose, And leaving Venice's ensanguined state, We may be happy, if no more we're great! [At this moment a voice is heard to call “Catarina.” She turns round in alarm, and perceives at her side Moncenigo, who has entered from the secret chamber, O.P. Mon. Through me, who at this hour thy presence seeks, Forget not, lady, 'tis thy country speaks! If thou Adolphe de Courcy's life wouldst save From dangers neither are prepar'd to brave, Tell him thou hast forgot him, and that, lured By brighter prospects to thy heart assured, By light thou ne'er hadst hop'd on thee to shine, The love thou gav'st him is no longer thine! Cat. Vain from my mind that image to efface, And blasphemy to utter word so base! Mon. It rests with thee, thou hast but now been told, While Venice and thyself thou dost uphold The danger to await in which he stands— Cat. And who that life would dare to seek? Mon. (lifting up the drapery of the secret chamber and discovering three Assassins, therein concealed, with uplifted daggers.) Their hands! [He instantly enters the secret chamber, and as the curtain falls over him 12 o'clock strikes. Adol. (singing under the balcony) Oh, lovely is the night. Cat. Oh, heaven! Ado. And tranquil is the sea! Cat. (in agony and terror) He's lost! Ado. Come down and take thy flight Beautiful bird with me. [ Catarina is on the point of falling down at the foot of the table O.P. when she sees Adolphe climb over the balcony. He takes off his cloak, throws it down to the boatman, and seeing Catarina, runs to her. She remains immoveable, with her eyes fixed on the secret chamber. Duet. Ado. Enchantress of my life! Again, 'tis thee I see, My own affianced wife! From foes and from false friends, I come now to thee, And from where thou may'st happy and honored be, bear thee. Cat. (affectionately) Adolphe! Ado. Ah, in their shame and guilt They had two hearts bereaved, Whose hopes were on devotion built, And vows by Heaven received! Cat. (aside) Adolphe!—my tongue expression doth deny— Ado. Ah! why, when near me, do I hear that sigh? Cat. (aside) If happiness be here yet death is there. [pointing to secret door. Ado. And dost thou not this joyful moment share, Partake of that delight, the vast excess Of this fond bosom which to thine I press? Cat. Forgive me should there steal Of grief one latent tear. Ado. What sorrow canst thou feel When thine Adolphe is near? Cat. (aside) (Ensemble) May heaven forgive this seeming guilt Which one so true deceived; Whose hopes were on devotion built, And vows by heaven received. Ado. (Ensemble) Oh! well nigh in their shame and guilt They had two hearts bereaved, Whose hopes were on devotion built, And vows by Heav'n received. Ado. (pointing to the window) My bark, which o'er the tide Shall float with muffled oar, Is watched for by a guide On yonder friendly shore. Come, while the wave is sparkling, Far from the strand— Come, while the shade is darkling Under the land. The moon may guard the night, While all around her sleeps, Yet love, by that pure light, Its constant vigil keeps. Cat. (escaping from the arms of Adolphe, who is attempting to draw her towards the balcony.) No, no, Adolphe, it must not, cannot be, Fly hence, at once, and think no more on me. Ado. And is that oath, which closely linked our lot, Thus disregarded, or remembered not? Cat. (aside) That he should thus upbraid, When I'm the victim made! Ado. Say you no longer love? my life or death, My very being hangs upon your breath! Cat. Have pity! Ado. Speak! Cat. Hold—hold! my madden'd brain! [She perceives the curtain over the secret chamber lifted up, and the glittering of the Assassin's poignards. Then—I confess—I ne'er can love again— I mean—not thee— [Catarina, with a convulsive sob, buries her face in her hands, while Adolphe stands as if nailed to the spot. Ado. (partially recovering) And her own lips proclaim At once her guilt, her perfidy, and shame Cat. (aside) Abandoned and betrayed, Forsaken now by all, I heed no more if ill Or ruin o'er me fall: May my deceitful words Forgiven be above, For 'tis him, only him, That ever I can love. Ado. Oh, let me not believe, while thus I sue to thee, That one I worshipped so, can ever perjured be! Cat. (aside) May heav'n that mercy shew denied to man— (to him) Depart Adolphe, in safety—while you can— [Catarina leaves him, and takes the extreme side of the stage, P. S. Ado. The truth is told, that truth which hath revealed The fearful secret which thy breast hath steeled. Cat. (astounded) What secret?— Ado. —to the (now deemed slender) claim Of deep affection and unspotted fame, A rival offers to thy dazzled eyes Rank, wealth, and station—baubles women prize. Cat. Oh, Heavens! Ado. It is the talk of Venice—from each lip The base and idle do the scandal sip— A Prince!—a King hath offered thee a hand, With gold and gear thy pride cannot withstand. Cat. This is too dreadful. Ado. —If these rumours lie, Say but one word— [Catarina perceiving Moncenigo, who appears at the door of the secret chamber in a threatening gesture, and disappears. (to Adolphe) 'Tis too true! (then aside) Let me die. Ado. (with calm despair) I pardon thee, for whom I cherish yet Unworthy fondness, and a vain regret; But he my heart who rifled, from it tore The peace therein which time cannot restore; Him will I course to earth's remotest part, And at the altar's foot stab through his heart. Cat. (Ensemble) Despite this scorching pain Which seems to crush my brain, One solace is for me; That but for each false word, By him in credence heard, His life would forfeit be! Ado. (Ensemble) Despite this scorching pain Which seems to crush the brain, One thought comes back to me, That with each perjured word, Mine ear too sadly heard, Her heart thus changed should be! Cat. (running to Adolphe as he rushes up the stage) Adolphe, one word before you quite efface— Ado. With thee, who these ties for another can'st sever? Cat. Alas! you know not—were you in my place— Ado. I would not have betrayed— Cat. You go then?— Ado. —For ever! [On uttering this exclamation, Adolphe throws Catarina from him, and rushes off over the balcony, near to which Catarina falls senseless on the stage—at the same moment the curtain of the secret chamber is undrawn, and the Assassins enter at that door, preceded by Moncenigo. Mon. (exultingly) A kingdom and a crown those tears will dry— Catarina!— [pointing to the body of Catarina, then addressing the Assassins. With her to Cyprus hie. [The Assassins go up the stage, as Moncenigo exit at the secret chamber door, and the scene closes them in. SCENE II. —Apartment in the Moncenigo Palace. Enter Moncenigo, 1st. E. O. P. My dream is realized—and greatness now Is mine, as if a crown were on my brow— That gew-gaw I to Cyprus gladly yield, While still the power of Venice I can wield— As her ambassador received and known, I work her object and attain mine own— That object still is, wealth and station there, Without the odium here I'm doomed to bear— And then to carry out the hate I trace Within my breast to Andréa and his race— Some impulse undefined—some latent thought— From jealousy, suspicion, passion, caught, Perhaps unjustly, but imbibed so deep, That vengeance cannot pause, nor action sleep, And these two principles, in force combined, Excite the feeling and direct the mind. Air. Oh, what hopes at their height Now burst forth upon the sight, For wealth and rank, in all their might, Shall both be mine to-night. 'Tis in vain we would hush, All the strifes the heart which flush— An idle dream those thoughts to crush, Which from its sources rush. The course I follow will through the world, Despite the malice by others hurled, Of those thoughts in their might, All my hopes to requite— While pursuit shall be mine, and to-night. Second Verse. In revenge there's delight, With that feeling, at its height— And such revenge, in all its might, I revel in to-night. 'Tis in vain we would quell All the storms the heart which swell, Or seek to calm the griefs that dwell Within that secret cell. The course I follow will through the world, Despite the malice by others hurled, Of revenge, in its might, All my wrongs to requite— Which revenge shall be mine, and to-night. [Exit Moncenigo. SCENE III. —The battlements of the Palace at Famagosta, in Cyprus, with a view of the port seen under them, guards stationed at various parts, and the stage thronged with the populace, sailors, &amp;c. Chorus of Populace. Hail to this joyous day, May the smiles which o'er each cheek now play To all around attest, The hearts they spring from are at rest. The banner of war is furled, and peace Now bids all the feelings of discord cease. Like her the fair, and him the free, Meeting in love and harmony, Let all united be! A DIVERTISSEMENT Here takes place, composed of national sports and dances, between the people and the sailors of the port, after which the heralds advance, and at the sound of trumpet, make the following Proclamation. People of Cyprus in the barque which nears Our port, our monarch's chosen Queen appears; St. Mark's immortal lion gilds her sail, Filled by the breath of love upon the gale; In fervent prayer your voices now unite, That joy and peace her gentle path may light! [March—Then enter the Clergy, headed by the Archbishop of Cyprus, joining with the people in this Chorus. Power divine Before Thee we incline! Humbly we Thee implore, Thou of whom earth and sky Worship the might and majesty, Thy gifts on them to pour! [After the prayer is heard on the sea, in the distance. “Chorus of Sailors. “To land, to land, “To happy land “Our vessel wings its way! “And souls as light “Partake her flight, “Across the sparkling spray.” “Chorus of Priests and People. “Power divine, “Before Thee we incline, “Humbly we Thee implore, “Thou of whom earth and sky, “Worship the might and majesty, “Thy gifts on them to pour.” [During this and the preceding Chorus the fleet which accompanies the state-vessel, with Catarina on board, is seen to pass in the distance, firing a salute, which is returned by the guns of the port—bells are in full ring, and loud flourish of trumpets, &amp;c. heard on all sides, and with a brilliant march, at first distant, then louder, the procession begins. The King, preceded by Pages, Squires, Heralds-at-Arms, and followed by all his Court, meets the Archbishop and Clergy—then enter a body of Knights and their respective banners—then the King's Body-guard, Officers of the Army and Navy, Equerries, Ministers of State, the Municipal Body, and a File of Soldiers. At a given point the state-vessel reaches the port, when Pages lay down a rich carpet the whole length of stage, and young girls strew it with flowers. Catarina then descends, led by Andréa on one side, and Moncenigo on the other (as Ambassador) and followed by a Deputation from the Venetian Senate. She is met by the King, who kneels at her foot, and kisses her hand—then rising, he leads her forward, and presents her to the people, who all bow before her—the King advances, and sings Solo. People of Cyprus! on this solemn day To her, our Queen affianced, homage pay: While, bowed in thankfulness to Him above, You offer fervent prayers— Oh, may the crown she wears Be on her brow supported by your love! Full Chorus. Long live Catarina—long may live the King! Chorus of Priests. Hosanna! glory be to the Most High! Chorus of All. Let our song of joy and duty ring Throughout the gladdened sky. [The procession continues streaming down the battlements—the dancing and sports are carried on in the distance—the vessels hoist their flags, and guns keep up an incessant firing, the bells still ringing—a deafening shout from the whole populace, and the waving of banners on the walls and all elevated parts never cease, until the Act drops.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —The Gardens of a Casino at Nicosia, in Cyprus. On the O. P. side a sort of vine arbour, having the appearance of a green tunnel, extends up the stage from the first to the sixth wing. On the P. S., massive trees, clumps of verdure, &amp;c., two large tables in front O. P. and P. S.. On the P. S., steps leading to the interior of the Casino. Rich moonlight, the arbour lighted with splendid candelabra from the trees, &amp;c. &amp;c. On the rising of the curtain, groups of Cypriots and Venetians are discovered at the tables drinking and playing, while others are standing about. Pages are serving each table. Chorus. The world is only after all A game— Its end—how high the stake, or small— The same. And love and joy, fly off with pace Of wind, And leave not in their flight a trace Behind. Your sage will blame the world, and will with rigour view it Your fool is with it pleased, and all belonging to it. [During the latter part of this chorus a body of Dancers enter down the arbour, mixing with the Chorus, and then retiring from, and returning to, them. Second Verse. Although we may the ills we seek Deplore, Will all that make us live one week The more? If pleasure is, as people deem, Soon gone, And life itself be but a dream— Dream on. [Here the Dancers join in again to the termination of the chorus. Your sage will blame the world, and will with rigour view it, Your fool is with it pleased, and all belonging to it. [As the Chorus and Dancers mingle together, and exeunt, and as the sounds are dying away, Moncenigo enters through the arbour attended by Strozzi and followed by the three Assassins in the distance, in cloaks and masks. Str. (bowing respectfully) Of Venice's Ambassador, the ear I claim one moment— Mon. —Speak— Str. —Adolphe is here! Mon. What dost thou say? At Cyprus dost thou mean? Str. The tongue will answer what the eye hath seen— Thyself be judge—for see where musing there, Beneath yon porch, he stands upon the stair. [Pointing to a Knight who, wrapped up in a cloak, is seen slowly descending the staircase, P. S. Mon. (aside in agitation) Ah, this may mar my plans, for should he dare, The secret of that love, once his, declare, And in some jealous, frantic mood, disclose Things in oblivion, or at least repose, The King, thus undeceived, may break the chain Which Venice will have round him wove in vain— And that great rite the morning's sun had blest (pausing—then to Strozzi) Your poignards? Str. Are at hand— [Pointing to a group of Assassins standing near the P. S. Mon. —You heed the rest! [Strozzi makes a sign to the Assassins to follow the footsteps of Adolphe, who has crossed to the end of the garden. Strozzi at the back listening, Mon. (thoughtful) Air. “Uncertain fate! how blindly is he led “Who deems one moment that he holds thy thread— “The wealth we own, the power we wield to-day, “To-morrow sees despoiled, or wrenched away, “Yet, from her edicts we may learn this fact, “He who would safely live must firmly act! [Here is heard in the distance, the Burthen of the Chorus. “Your sage will blame the world, and will with rigour view it, “Your fool is with it pleased, and all belonging to it.” Second Verse. “Laugh on, laugh on, oh, little do ye know “The puppets here you are, or where ye go— “Before your griefs though young affections fly, “The tears they shed ye have no power to dry, “And soon or late ye will at length discern “All you deemed knowledge you have yet to learn!” [Exit Moncenigo, O. P., making a sign to Strozzi to remain. Chorus. (Heard again somewhat louder) “Your sage will blame the world, and will with rigour view it, “Your fool is with it pleased, and all belonging to it.” [At the termination, a clashing of swords is heard outside. Ado. —Assassins on my track—help, give me aid! Chorus of Assassins. Strike through his heart, each blow will well be paid. [On hearing the noise, Strozzi is seen to go off in the direction of Moncenigo, when Adolphe rushes in sword in hand, followed by Lusignano, who is in armour and masked. Ado. (to Lusignano) Oh let my lip its grateful homage speak For succour, when the strong oppressed the weak. Lus. Sir Knight, I trust that all like me had felt, And turn'd aside the blows assassins dealt— [Here Lusignano lifts up his vizor, and both sheath their swords. Duet. Ado. Oh! you who knighthood's honors grace, Who follow knighthood's laws, Who danger's front can boldly face In glory's dazzling cause, Tell me your name? Lus. The sole reward For this slight service shown, I ask you now, is your accord To keep that name unknown. Ado. May I not ask to whom I owe my life? Lus. A friendly hand. Ado. Your country then? Lus. France gave me birth. Ado. (with transport) Mine own—mine ever lovely land! Oh, joy that few can know, When those of that blest spot of earth Meet on a foreign strand! Lus. Oh, what ennobling thoughts My soul entrance, To clasp here in mine arms A son of France! Ado. (with expression) “And ever blest be Heav'n, “Which deigned to send, “Where all were reckoned foes, “A fearless friend.” Ado. and Lus. (Ensemble) Hail to that noble land, To the free and happy there; The dwelling of the good and grand, Of the spotless and the fair. Ado. “Are you a knight? Lus. “I am! Ado. “In heart and arms “Twofold a brother, whom the double charm “Of country and of honour now unite. Lus. “In feeling constant and in glory bright, “For fate one common parent both ordained, “And gave the same heart, dauntless and unstained.” Ensemble. “Hail to that noble land, “To the free and happy there; “The dwelling of the good and grand, “Of the spotless and the fair.” Cantabile. Lus. Sad exile on the stranger's shore, How often have I sighed For days that can return no more, And hopes that with them died; For scenes whereon my childhood basked, In bliss so far beyond My dreams of joy, I never asked If others were as fond. (then to Adolphe) Oh! do thou, with my words proclaim Though here condemned to dwell, That I've an arm to shield her fame, A heart that loves her well. Ado. (dejected) Vain hope, though gladly I her shores would fly, Yet on this isle fate chains me down to die! Lus. (surprised) To die!— Ado. (burthen of the Cantabile) Like you, upon the stranger's shore, How often have I sighed For days that can return no more, And hopes that with them died; For scenes whereon my childhood basked In bliss, so far beyond My dreams of joy, I never asked If others were as fond. (then to Lusignano) “And with thy words I would proclaim “The pangs my breast which swell,” I had an arm to shield her fame, A heart that loved her well. Ado. (Ensemble) I had an arm to shield her fame, A heart that loved her well. Lus. (Ensemble) Your arm should ever shield her fame, Your heart still love her well. Lus. Are you unhappy?—say— Ado. I must conceal, Save from my God, the grief 'tis mine to feel. Lus. If or my rank or sword can ever speed Thee or thy sorrows, in their utmost need, Come thou and claim them, and thy wishes bring E'en to the very palace of the King. Ado. (aside) The King! that rival who had doom'd my life To the vile thirst of the assassin's knife— “Who broke my peace, my heart with anguish rent, “And for revenge my footsteps here I bent. [Flourishes of trumpets and salvos of artillery are heard. Lus. List to the distant, but the joyous sound Which doth from sphere to sphere thus startling bound. Ado. What signal doth it bear? Lus. It is—to say Unto the empire, that with early day A Queen is theirs, the cannons now give breath— Ado. (aside) For me the signal of revenge, or death. Ensemble. [Accompanied by the distant ringing of bells, sound of trumpets, and firing of artillery. Lus. (aside) (Ensemble) The cannon rebounding Enkindles my soul As, far away sounding, Its loud echoes roll: Beloved and lovely woman, Thy smile doth dispel All the fears of thy people, And monarch as well. Ado. (aside) (Ensemble) The cannon rebounding Enkindles my soul, Whose fury is bounding Beyond my control; Deceitful, perjur'd woman, Whose heart could rebel, And break the vows my sorrows Remember too well. Lus. (to Ado.) Brother in arms, adieu! though call'd away, And forc'd that call of duty to obey, Meet where we may, for ever I extend The faith of knighthood, and the hand of friend. [Lusignano and Adolphe clasping each other by the hand. Ensemble. Yes, here I swear, for ever to extend The faith of knighthood, and the hand of friend! Reprise of the previous ensemble. Lus. (aside) (Ensemble) The cannon rebounding Enkindles my soul, As far away sounding Its loud echoes roll. Beloved and lovely woman, Thy smile doth dispel All the fears of thy people, And monarch as well! Ado. (aside) (Ensemble) The cannon resounding, Enkindles my soul, Whose fury is bounding Beyond my control. Deceitful, perjured woman, Whose heart could rebel, And break the vows my sorrows Remember too well! [Lusignano and Adolphe again grasp each other by the hand—the sounds of the cannon, trumpets, &amp;c. continues, and the ringing of bells, when Lusignano exit O. P., and Adolphe is about to rush off, P. S., when he perceives Catarina descending the stairs, and he reels back to the O. P. side. Ado. (aside) Great Heaven! some film hath shrouded o'er mine eyes, Some chance hath stirred my heart with wild surprise, Almost too much to bear,—'tis she—'tis she! And thoughts of madness and of memory Rush back at once upon me— Cat. —The calm night, The freshness of the air, that solitude On which no sick'ning revel can intrude, Suit best my soul—unfettered, I can think, Amidst the conflicts which my spirits sink, On other scenes, contrasted as they are, Remembered always, though divided far! [Turns round, sees Adolphe, and draws her veil over her. A stranger here! some spy, perchance, to bear The words with which I fear to trust the air; (turning round to Adolphe) What is't ye seek here? Ado. —Nothing more of you! Cat. (recognising his voice and shrieking) Adolphe! (almost falling) Ado. —A principle 'twere vain to guess, Maintained by honor, and despair no less, Has led me here, but Heaven my witness be, The shaft was aimed at others, not at thee. Cat. Have pity on me?— Ado. —I've essayed, in vain, The peace I once could boast of to regain; The dreams of night, the visions of the day Have all, but one remembrance, chased away; Which clings around me, till my senses wake, Then weep themselves to rest— Cat. —Some pity take. Ado. And where each furrow of despair appears, Its lines can never be effaced by tears; But if the darkened light once more should break Upon these aching eyes— Cat. —Oh, pity take! Ballad. Ado. Oh, smile as thou wert wont to smile, Before the weight of care Had crushed thy heart, and for awhile Left only sorrow there; Some thoughts perchance 'twere best to quell, Some impulse to forget, On which should mem'ry cease to dwell, We may be happy yet! Oh! never name departed days Nor vows you whispered then, Round which too sad a feeling plays To trust their tones again; Regard their shadows round thee cast As if we ne'er had met, And thus unmindful of the past We may be happy yet! Cat. (starting up) This is too much, and now despite the oath Which fettered one, and broke the peace of both, I will my soul unburthen—on that night When urged by thee to trust our fate to flight, With thee my honor, hope, and all to lose, I dared myself of faithlessness accuse; When shunning truths I was forbid to tell, I lisped—I could not speak—words false as hell! Ado. Say on! say all!— Cat. —Assassins were concealed Within my chamber, where, had I appealed, Or spoken word, or made one gest, or sign, Thy days were lost (I gave no thought of mine) For thee, I prized e'en then all things above, More than my life, I sacrificed my love! Ado. (falling at Catarina's feet) Forgive me, Catarina! (then rising) (Ensemble) Despite this tortured brain— Each pang I feel— Despite mine honor's stain No time can heal; Although she can her vow No more fulfil, Though lost for ever now, I love her still! Despite his tortured brain— All he can feel— Despite his honor's stain, No time can heal; Although I can my vow No more fulfil, Though lost for ever now, He loves me still! [During this ensemble Moncenigo, attended by Strozzi, has appeared in the back ground—he gives Strozzi directions, on perceiving Adolphe at the feet of Catarina, and exit Strozzi. Cat. (to Adolphe, tenderly) Now fly!— Mon. (advancing between them) —It is too late— Cat. What brought you here Unbidden?— Ado. (to Moncenigo) Face to face at length we meet, And vengeance long delayed is doubly sweet! Mon. Speak on— Ado. —Canst thou deny that all this scene Of torture, madness, injury, has been Thy work, and that, as creature of the king, Her sad consent by menace thou didst wring? That bravo's in thy service and thy pay, Extorted oaths to lie her life away— That spies pursued her steps—and, by thee planned, My days were doomed to the assassin's hand? Canst thou deny— Mon. —I came prepared to tell Each deed and word by thee detailed so well— Cat. This tissue then of horrors now I see, This hellish plot was all conceived— Mon. —By me! Cat. And when these acts, remorseless, as they're great, I to the king, my lord, and thine relate— Mon. The king will not believe you—but when told The scene I chanced this moment to behold— When, bending at your foot, a rival came To stamp upon his crown the mark of shame— When his betrothed, the dame so pure who seemed, Is by the Cyprus laws “adultress” deemed— Cat. Great Heavens!— Mon. —When thy treason to the throne, To him who sways its sceptre shall be known. Monarch and subject, acting then one part, Will, to the world, proclaim thee what thou art! [Adolphe and Catarina stand as if petrified, while Moncenigo makes a sign for Strozzi to advance with the Guards who have entered at the back during this scene. Mon. On to the citadel—in parted cell, See both these traitors watched and guarded well. [Exit Moncenigo up the stage, as a party march off with Adolphe on the O. P. side, and another party, headed by Strozzi, with Catarina, on the P. S. and the scene closes. SCENE II. —Anti-room in the Palace. Enter Lusignano, meeting Andréa, followed by a Page, O. P. Lus. “Lord Moncenigo seeks an audience? Page. “—Sire, “He comes in haste— Lus. “—Admit him, and retire— [The Page crosses, and exit P. S. “—What does this haste imply? comes he to chide “The cold delay which chills a chosen bride? “Or, with some Venice gossip, or some plot “Of rival states, she fears—no matter what— “My heart is light and happy now— [Moncenigo enters P. S., ushered in by the Page, who retires, O. P. “Your hand— “My lord ambassador—I understand “You would confer with us, and none can be “In worth, or service, prized so much by me. “What canst thou ask? thy power, it is known, “To act, is second only to mine own— “To-morrow's work is thine—my throne, my life, “And, what upholds and honours both, a wife; “Endowed beyond what other states bestow, “And any dowry worth, to thee I owe. Mon. “And may that fate, which all our thoughts can sift, “Will, that it may not prove a fatal gift. Lus. “What mean you?— Mon. “—To the point: perchance “You may have heard a chevalier of France “Whilome paid court to that illustrious dame “Whose hand from Venice you now seek to claim. Lus. “Of France?— Mon. “—I had the matter to you brought, “But that I deem'd it scarcely worthy thought; “Now, it must fix attention— Lus. “—Plainer speak— Mon. “And action nerve the heart if that be weak. Lus. “Thou sett'st my blood on fire—I charge thee speak. Lus. “Adolphe de Courcy—he—that knight—was seen “With her whom Cyprus calls to-morrow Queen, “In yon casino's gardens, at her feet, “Mingling those sighs of lovers when they meet. Lus. “'Tis false as hell!— Mon. “—I should have deemed it so had not “These eyes beheld their guilt upon the spot. Lus. “A knight of France—'tis he whose life I saved “Not long ago—has he my fury braved, “And paid me with dishonor? on me cast “Anguish and infamy for years to last. Mon. “This outrage upon Venice, shame on thee, “And treason to the state, atoned must be. Lus. “Did not thy love for me, thy blush for them, “At once revenge the crime thou must condemn? Mon. “Thy kingdom hath its laws, which have decreed “That death alone can expiate such deed. “I placed a guard upon them, and they wait “Thy word to lead them to their fitting fate. Lus. “Accomplished be it then, be death her doom, “And banishment be his. The silent tomb “Shall end her guilt—(aside) but, oh! what time can heal “The deepening anguish it is mine to feel. “Summon the council, not an hour shall stay “My deadly vengeance— Mon. “—I your will obey. [Moncenigo bows to the King and exit P. S. rapidly with exultation. Lus. “Distracted, yet perplexed, my soul still yearns “To spare a crime whose object though it spurns; “But no—no—all shall see, if some beweep, “That heart whose love was fond, has hate as deep—” [As Lusignano is rushing out O. P., he encounters Andréa. Lus. We meet again, but not as once we met, And when and why, the task is to forget. And. What moves your Highness?— Lus. —Sorrow, shame, and guilt, Blood that I fain would save, but must be spilt. “Thy niece, thy Catarina— And. “What of her? “And who upon her name would dare to slur? Lus. Know'st thou Adolphe de Courcy? And. Once I knew A Knight so called, to faith and honor true! Lus. That Knight, thy niece's paramour, has dared To shame the crown, which I with her had shared— Hither he's come, those scenes to play once more Which Venice saw, without a blush, before— “But Cyprus ne'er shall know—for morning's sun “Sees what the headsman, not the priest, has done. And. Not more in her than him do I confide, And any tongue, but thine, had darkly lied, To pass this crime upon them— Lus. —For the fact Lord Moncenigo vouches, and will act! Duet. Lus. (Ensemble) Before these bursting eyes, High in the gaze of all, She, deemed of worth the prize, Shall in her beauty fall: The blow which parts the links of life, Its fondest ties may sever, But better years of lasting life, Than live dishonored ever. And. (Ensemble) She, whom so much I prize, If once contemned of all, Unpitied, in mine eyes, Shall in her beauty fall: In scenes of sorrow and of strife From fond ties doomed to sever, 'Twere better burst the bonds of life, Than live dishonored ever. And. Should Moncenigo's word with thee prevail! For as he told, so hath he forged this tale— Bring him before my face— Lus. —Be well assured That thou shalt see him, and with her secured Now in her dungeons, Cyprus too shall see The doom is just, though dread its course may be. And. Encircled by some plot, pursued by hate That raised at first, and now completes her fate, Has Moncenigo lured his victim still— But there is one can thwart him, and who will, Be thou but just— Lus. —Full justice shall thou find, For though embittered now, this heart was kind! (then aside) Solo. He who has ever felt Those joys the heart which melt The anguish can define Such rapture to resign— That anguish now is mine! And. (aside) If false, her name let none again protect; If true, her honour they shall still respect; For tho' no child of mine, yet fond and dear Her charms of youth have found a parent here— (laying his hand on his heart, with energy) Solo. He who has ever felt Those ties the heart which melt The torture can define, Those ties when bid resign— That torture now is mine! Lus. No more then, and begone! upon the brink Of fate as now she stands, if I could think Thy—mine no longer—Catarina, free From crime, tho' now with crime accused she be, A load were off my heart; but, 'tis in vain, And mine the grief, the madness, and the stain! And. She shall not fall alone (aside) for now her birth Those papers will attest, perhaps her worth. [to Lusignano. Let all beware this shame on me who cast, For those who wrong'd her most may aid her last. Lus. Upon her head the guilt, on mine the grief, Which seeks no solace, and hopes no relief. (Ensemble.) Before these bursting eyes, High in the gaze of all, She, deemed of worth the prize, Shall in her beauty fall: The blow which parts the links of life Its fondest ties may sever, But better years of lasting strife, Than live dishonored ever! And. (Ensemble.) She whom so much I prize, If once contemned of all, Unpitied in mine eyes, Shall in her beauty fall: In scenes of sorrow and of strife From fond ties doomed to sever, 'Twere better burst the bonds of life, Than live dishonored ever! At the end of this ensemble, Lusignano rushes off, O. P., Andréa, P. S. LAST SCENE. —Public place in Nicosia. Scaffold erected on an elevated stage, lined with Soldiers, and an avenue of Soldiers, extending from scaffold to front of stage, where Catarina is discovered kneeling in the centre—on either side are erected pavilions for the King, Court, Archbishop, and Clergy— in the square formed by the Soldiery, Black and Grey Penitents are kneeling—Herald at back—the populace crowd on either side up to the extreme extent and height of stage—the King conceals his face in his hands—Moncenigo stands by his side—deep bell tolling—muffled drums beating. Chorus of Penitents. Pray for the soul's repose, Pray for the peace of those Whose thoughts on Heaven are bent. Cat. That Heaven knows I am innocent. Chorus of Women. Pray for a sister's woes, Whose erring days now close. May Heaven forgive a life mis-spent! Cat. “That Heaven knows I am innocent!” Herald. For treason to the State, Deem'd fatal in the Council's eyes, For dishonour to the King, Catarina Cornaro dies! [Addressing Catarina. Wherefore the law should stop its dread intent, What canst thou plead?— Cat. —That I am innocent. Herald (aloud) Who can allege a reason why The guilty should not perish?— And. (rushing frantically through the Soldiers.) —I! [General movement. The King rises and comes down, Andréa kneels at his feet, then rises. Moncenigo crosses to the centre, while Catarina springs up and reels towards the P. S. followed by the Priest, the Herald retires up the centre. Your pardon, mighty liege, (then to Catarina) poor blighted thing, Almost without a hope to which to cling— Without a hope? 'tis false! this speaking proof May soften hate, and keep revenge aloof— [turning round upon Moncenigo. Inhuman fiend! by lips through fear though sealed In Venice, here the truth shall be revealed— “Not fear of thee, nor for myself, but dread “Of secret death, of blood in darkness shed, “Of rack and wheel, those crimes thy rule hath stained, “In which the limbs of others thou hadst chained— “Now I can speak unfettered.—” Mon. “—Have a care, “And of that rule, diminished not, beware. And. Know'st thou Bianca Sforza? [Moncenigo staggers. —Ha, that name Flings o'er thy cheek the deepened blush of shame. That heiress of her noble house, e'en as she died, Had barely strength her secret to confide: As the last words of parting life she gasp'd, In sudden energy my hand she clasp'd, Gave me this protest, blest her babe to light Just born, then sunk in endless night. Mon. (partially recovering and addressing the King) “Heed not, my liege— Lus. “His tale doth move my soul, “And may the pages of dark crimes unroll. And. “Dark as they can be—see how Heaven hath work'd, “This moral in a soul where guilt so lurk'd— “True to my trust this fondling I have reared, “By love, by youth, by purity endeared, While “poor Bianca Sforza, she whom art Ruined, and left to die with broken heart, She was her mother, speciously beguiled— (pointing to Moncenigo) He the betrayer—(pointing to Catarina)—and there stands their child! (rushing up to Moncenigo with desperation) “Although to me and mine thy hate is known, “She whom thou now would'st murder is thine own!” Cat. (with a convulsion of feeling). What do I hear? Oh, nature, how thy laws Bring back our feelings to their primal cause— Bewildered—almost mad—pursued by hate, Standing through him upon the verge of fate, Whate'er his guilt—whate'er my lot may be, Oh—Heaven—he is my father!— (staggers over to Moncenigo, and falls in his arms. Lus. “—Heaven's decree “Accomplish'd is.” (to Officer) Adolphe de Courcy hither call, And on the guilty retribution fall. [Exit Officer, after bowing to the King, O. Trio. Lus. (astounded) (Ensemble) If true his tale—unstained her name— My deep remorse I would proclaim, Atone for blood my rage had spilt, In deep conviction of her guilt! Mon. (Catarina senseless in his arms) (Ensemble) Too true his tale—her tender fame I spotless deem, and will proclaim; And thus atone for years of guilt And blood a false revenge had spilt! And. (with energy) (Ensemble) Too true my tale—her noble name As spotless, I aloud proclaim— Free from dishonour, and that guilt For which they now her blood had spilt! [At the end of Trio, Adolphe de Courcy is conducted in by the Officer, and escorted by a file of Soldiers; he is greatly excited on seeing Catarina, and beholding the King. Lus. Well may'st thou shrink, when he thy life who gave, Has, for thy baseness, stripped thee of thy glaive! Ado. (erect, and with great pride) I will not now disguise, whate'er the shame, It was, to take thy life, I hither came; “I knew thee not, the pangs alone I knew “That soul and body pierced me madly through— “My Saviour now I see—and 'neath the axe, “In life, till death, thou might'st my service tax—” I do not seek thy pardon, but, to spare Her life, so good, I solemnly declare Before that Judge who hidden hearts can see, Her soul is pure as virtue's e'er can be— Lus. I do believe thee, and the world shall find, To justice, station cannot make me blind. (pointing to Officer, and then addressing Adolphe) Adolphe de Courcy, sheath thy sword again, Which thou hast worn thus far without a stain; “Though I endure what time alone can heal, “Others no more shall bear the grief I feel—” Lord Moncenigo, in oblivion now The past I bury, and do here avow My will, to all announced, by all here heard, Her hand be on the heart loved best conferred. [Here Lusignano passes to the centre, and joins the hands of Catarina and Adolphe, Moncenigo, stands on O. P., Andréa, P. S. Largo. Ado. “O'erwhelmed with thoughts too great, “Crushed by thy nobleness of soul, “I sink beneath the weight “Of feeling I no more control. “My guilty aim—my crime, “Oh, pity and forgive! “My spirit, body, life-blood, all, “Thine own are while I live!” Quintette. Lus. (Ensemble) “All idle rancour now I cast aside, “And give that happiness to me denied. Ado. (Ensemble) “Unshaken fondness to my spotless bride, “And faith to him who gave her, be my guide! Cat. (to Lusignano) (Ensemble) “And while my days in peacefulness shall glide, “All gratitude to thee shall be my pride! Mon. (to Lusignano) (Ensemble) “By thy decision gladly I abide, “Confirming happiness so long denied. And. (exultingly) (Ensemble) “The will of Heaven doth o'er her fate preside, “And grants that happiness so long denied.” Rondo. Cat. (advancing) There is no human joy, No bliss the soul which fills, No hope the heart can buoy, Like that each sense now thrills; My thought almost o'erleaps The barrier reason keeps. Full Chorus. Envied for ever be Her noble name! Afar her purity Let all proclaim! Cat. “This spell too bright to bear, “This sudden vast excess “Of love's beyond the share “Of mortal happiness.” [A long shout from the assembled multitude, the flourishing of trumpets, beating of drums, waving of banners, and a general display of animation continues until the curtain falls.
