      <field name="fulltext">Dedication. TO Mr. WILLIAM McLAREN. Sir, With gratitude I reflect on the happy hours we have spent together, and in testimony of the high regard I entertain for your many worthy and amiable qualities, I take the liberty of INSCRIBING to you this littlle volume: several of the pieces contained in it you have already seen, and if the others afford you any pleasure, it will add much to the happiness of, Dear Sir, With true respect and sincerity, Your Friend, ROBERT TANNAHILL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PERSONS. MEN. The Laird, Colonel of a Scotch Regt. Gaffer, the Laird's Tenant. Muirland Willie, an old rich dotard. Harry, in love with Jean. WOMEN. Mirren, Gaffer's Wife, a foolish old Woman. Jean, Daughter of Gaffer and Mirren, beloved by Willie, but in love with Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A range of hills, o'erhung with waving woods, That spread their dark green bosoms to the clouds, And seem to crave the tribute of a show'r, Grateful to woodland plant and mountain flow'râ A glen beneath frae whilk a bick'rin' burn Strays round the knowes, wi' bonny wimplin' turn, Syne trottin' down-wards thro' the cultur'd lands, Runs by whare Gaffer's humble biggin' stands: His wife an' him are at some family plea, To bear what ails them, just step in and see. Gaffer and Mirren. Mirren. âLove should be free!ââMy trouth but ye craw crouse, You a Gudeman, an' canna' rule your house! Had I a father's pow'r, I'd let her see, Wi' vengeance, whether or no that love be free. She kends right weel Muirland has ilk thing ready, An's fit to keep her busket like a lady, Yet soon's she hears me mention Muirland Willie, She skits an' flings like ony towmont fillyâ Deil, nor ye'd broke your leg, gaun cross the hallan, That day ye fee'd the skelpor Highland callan, We've fed him, clad himâwhat's our mense for't a'? Base wretch, to steal our Dochter's heart awa'! âLove should be free!â gude trouth, a bonny story! That Muirland maun be lost for Highland Harry. Muirland comes down this nightâto tauk's nae use, For she shall gie consent or lea' the house. Oddsaffs! my heart did never wallop cadgier Than when the Laird took Harry for a sodger; An' now she sits a' day sae dowf an' blearie, An' sings luve sangs about her Highland Harry. Gaf. Indeed Gude-wife, the lad did weel enough, Was eident ay, an' deftly hel' the pleugh; But Muirland's up in years, an' shame to tell, Has ne'er been married tho' as auld's mysel'; His locks are lyart, an' his joints are stiff, A staff wad set him better than a wife. Sooner shall roses in December blaw, Sooner shall tulips flourish i'the snaw, Sooner the woods shall bud wi' winter's cauld, Than lasses quit a young man for an auld: Yet she may tak' him gin she likes, for me, My say shall never mak' them disagree. Mir. Ye hinna' the ambition o'a mouse, She'll gie consent this night or lea' the house. Enter Jean in haste. Jean. Father the sheep are nibblin' i'the corn, Wee Saundy's chain'd auld Bawtie to the thorn, An' bauson'd Crummock's broken frae the sta'. Och! a's gaen wrang since Harry gaed awa'. (Aside. Gaf. A house divided a gangs to the devil.â [Exit. Mir. Dochter come hereânow let us reason civil. Isn't siller mak's our ladies gang sae braw? Isn't siller buys their cleuks an' bonnets a'? Isn't siller busks them up wi' silks an' sattins, Wi' umbrellas, muffs, claeth-shoon, an' patons? Our Lady,âwhat is't gars us curtsey till her, An' ca' her Mam? why, just 'cause she has siller; Isn't siller mak's our gentles fair an sappy? Whilk lets us see, it's siller mak's fouks happy. Jean. Mither, ae simple question let me speir, Is Muirland fat or fair wi' a' his gear? Auld croighlin Wight, to hide the ails o'age, He capers like a monkey on a stage; An' cracks, an sings, an' gigles sae light an' kittle, Wi's auld beard slaver'd wi' tobacco spittle.â Mir. Peace, wardless slutâO, whan will youth be wise! Ye'll slight your carefu' Mither's gude advice: I've brought you up, an' made you what ye are; An' that's your thanks for a' my toil an' care: Muirland comes down this night, sae drap your stodgin', For ye must gie consent or change your lodgin'. [Exit. Jean. E'en turn me out, Muirland I'll never marry, What's wealth or life without my dearest Harry? SONG. Set to Music by Mr. Ross, Organist, Aberdeen. Our bonny Scots lads in their green tartan plaids, Their blue-belted bonnets, an' feathers sae braw, Rank't up on the green war' fair to be seen, But my bonny young laddie was fairest of a'; His cheeks war' as red as the sweet heather-bell, Or the red western cloud lookin' down on the snaw, His lang yellow hair o'er his braid shoulders fell, An' the eÃ©n o'the lasses war' fix'd on him a'. My heart sunk wi' wae on the wearifu' day, When torn frae my bosom they march'd him awa', He bade me farewell, he cried âO be leel.â An' his red cheeks war' wet wi' the tears that did fa'. Ah! Harry my love, tho' thou ne'er shou'dst return, Till life's latest hour, I thy absence will mourn, An' memory shall fade, like the leaf on the tree, E'er my heart spare ae thought on anither but thee. [Exit. SCENE II. Harry return'd, as servant to the Laird, Finds, for a whyle, his presence may be spar'd, An' here, his lane, he wanders o'er each scene, Whare first he lov'd an' fondly woo'd his Jean: He sees her cot, an' fain wad venture in, But weel he minds her mither's no' his frien'. Harry. Tir'd with the painful sight of human ills, Hail Caledonia! hail my native hills! Here exil'd virtue rears her humble cell, With nature's jocund, honest sons to dwell; And hospitality, with open door, Invites the stranger and the wand'ring poor; Tho' winter scowls along our northern sky, In hardships rear'd we learn humanity: Nor dare deceit here point her rankling dart, A Scotchman's eye's the window of his heart.â When fate and adverse fortune bore me far, O'er field and flood to join the din of war, My young heart sicken'd, gloomy was my mind, My love, my friends, my country all behind. But whether tost upon the briny flood, Or drag'd to combat in the scene of blood, Hope, like an angel, charm'd my cares away, And pointed forward to this happy day. Full well I mind yon breckan-skirted thorn, That sheds its milk-white blosoms by the burn, There first my heart life's highest bliss did prove, 'Twas there my Jeanie blushing own'd her love. Yon dark green plantins on the mountain's brow, Yon yellow whins an' broomy knowes below, Bring to my mind the happy, happy days, I spent with her upon these rural braesâ But while remembrance, thus, my bosom warms, I long to clasp my charmer in my arms. [Exit. SCENE III. Now Mirren's to the burn to sine her kirn, Here Jeanie waefu' sits an' reels her pirn, While honest Gaffer ay for peace inclin'd, Is ha'flins vext, an' freely speaks his mind. Gaffer. Thy Mither's gair an' set upon the warl, It's Muirland's gear that gars her like the carl, But nature bids thee spurn the silly tyke, An' wha wou'd wed wi' ane they canna' like; Just speak thy mind an' tell him ance for a', That eighteen ne'er can 'gree wi' sixty-twa: A mair disgusting sight I never knew, Than youthfu' folly 'neath an' auld grey pow. Enter Mirren blythely. Mir. Here comes our nei'bour hurryin' frae the muir, Mak' a' things snod, fey haste red up the floor; The like o'him to visit you an' me, Reflects an honour on our family: Now lassie, mind my high comman' in this, Whatever Muirland says, ye'll answer Yes. Jean. Whatever Muirland says! it shall be so, But soon as morning comes I'll answer No. (Aside Enter Muirland. Muir. Peace to the biggin'âhe, he, he. (Gigles.) how's a? Mir. Gayly, a thank youâWilliam come awa', An' tell us how ye fen' this night yoursel'? Muir. He, heâhis name be prais'd! faith unco weel, I ne'er was ha'f sae strang in a' my days, I'm grown sae fat, I'm like to burst my claise! Nae won'er o't! I'm just now at my prime, I'm just now five and threty come the time! Ho, ho, ho, ho. (coughs) I pity them wha're auld! Yestreen I catch'd a wee bit croighl o'cauld. Gaf. (disgusted) I might excuse a foolish, untaught bairn. But second childhood, sure will never learn. (Aside. [Exit. Muirland, half-blind with age, slips on his Spectacles secretly, recognizes Jean, advances to her and sings. SONG. Air.ââwhistle owre the lave o't.â O lassie will ye tak a' man, Rich in housin', gear an' lan', Deil tak' the cash! that I soud ban, Nae mair I'll be the slave o't; I'll buy you claise to busk you braw, A ridin' pouney, pad an' a', On fashion's tap we'll drive awa', Whip, spur, an' a' the lave o't. O Poortith is a wintry day, Cheerless, blirtie, cauld, an' blae, But baskin' under fortune's ray, There's joy what e'er ye'd have o't; Then gies your han' ye'll be my wife, I'll mak' you happy a' your life, We'll row in luve an' siller rife, Till death wind up the lave o't. Mir, Nae toilin' there to raise a heavy rent, Our fortune's madeâO lassie gie consent! (Aside to Jean Muir. Ye'll get a gouden ring an' siller brotch, An' now an' then we'll hurl in a coach; To shaw we're gentle, when we wauk on fit, In passin' poor fouk, how we'll flught and skit! Jean. An' tho' ye're rather auld I'm rather young, Our ages mix'd will stop the warl's tongue. Muir. Auld, said ye! No. Ye surely speak in jest. Your Mither ken's I'm just now at my best! Mir. The lass is blunt, she means na' as she says, Ye ne'er look'd ha'f sae weel in a' your days!!! Wi' canny care I've spun a pickle yarn, That honest-like we might set aff our bairn; If gang wi' me we'll o'er to Wabster Pate's, An' see him weavin' at the bridal sheets. Muir. The bridal sheets! he, he, he, he, what bliss! The bridal sheets! O gies an erl-kiss! Mir. Fey! come awa', and dinna' think o'kissin' Till ance Mess John hae gien you baith his blessin'. [Exuent Jean, Solus. Alas! my Mither's just like Whang the Miller, O'erturns her house in hopes o'fin'ing siller! For soon's I see the morning's first faint gleam, She wakens sorrowing frae her gouden dream. SONG. Air.ââMorneen I Gaberland.â Blythe was the time when he fee'd wi' my Father, O Happy war' the days when we herded the gither, O Sweet war' the hours when he row'd me in his plaidie, O An' vow'd to be mine, my dear Highland laddie, O But ah! waes me! wi' their sodg'ring sae gaudy, O The Laird's wys'd awa' my braw Highland laddie, O Misty are the glens, an' the dark hills sae cloudy, O That ay seem'd sae blythe wi' my dear Highland laddie, O. The blae-berry banks, now, are lonesome an' dreary, O Muddy are the streams that gush'd down sae clearly, O Silent are the rocks that echoed sae gladly, O The wild melting strains o'my dear Highland laddie, O Farewell my ewes! an' farewell my doggie, O Farewell ye knowes! now sae cheerless an' scroggie, O Farewell Glen-feoch! my Mammy and my Daddie, O I will lea' you a', for my dear Highland laddie, O. Thro' distant towns I'll stray a hapless stranger, In thoughts o'him I'll brave pale want an' danger, An' as I go, poor weeping, mournfu' pond'rer, Still some kind heart will cheer the weary wand'rer, [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Gaffer's House. Jean, her lane. SONG Set to Music by Mr. R. A. Smith. Lang syne, beside the woodland burn, Amang the broom sae yellow, I lean'd me 'neath the milk-white thorn, On nature's mossy pillow; A' 'round my seat the flow'rs were strew'd, That frae the wild wood I had pu'd, To weave mysel' a simmer snood, To pleasure my dear fellow. I twin'd the woodbine round the rose, Its richer hues to mellow, Green sprigs of fragrant birk I chose, To busk the sedge sae yellow, The crow-flow'r blue, an' meadow-pink, I wove in primrose-braided link, But little, little did I think I should have wove the willow. My bonnie lad was forc'd afar, Tost on the raging billow, Perhaps he's fa'n in bludy war, Or wreck'd on rocky shallow. Yet, ay I hope for his return, As round our wonted haunts I mourn, And often by the woodland burn I pu' the weeping willow. Enter Muirland. Muir. Faith! Patie's spool jinks thro' wi' wondrous might, An' ay it minds me o'âthe bridal night!â I've rowth o'sheets, sae never fash your thumbâ O! gies ae kiss before your Minnie come. Harry enters,âJeanie kens himâ Fast he grips her till his breastâ Willie gapes, an' glowrs, an' sanes him, Rins an' roars like ane possest; Wild, wilyart fancies revel in his brainâ They baith rin aff an' lea' him a' his lane. Muir. O murder, murder!âO!âI'll die wi' fear! O Gaffer, Mirren!âO, come here, come here! Enter Mirren, in haste. Mir. The peeswip's scraighin' owre the spunkie-cairn! My heart bodes illâO, William whares my bairn? Muir. A great red dragon, wi' a warlock claw, Has come, and wi' your Dochter flown awa'!!! Enter Gaffer, in haste. Gaf. What awfu' cry was yon I heard within? What mak's you glow'r an' what caus'd a yon din? Mir. A great big dragon, wi' a red airn claw, Has come an' wi' our Dochter flown awa! (Crying. Muir. Its head was cover'd wi' a black airn ladle! Black legs it had, an' tail as sharp's a needle! A great red e'e stood starin' in its breast! I'm like to swarfâO, 'twas a fearfu' beast! Mir. The craw that bigged i'the stack yard thorn, Scraigh'd an forsook its nest when she was born; Three pyats crost the kirk when she was christen'd; I've heard it tauld, an' trembl'd while I listen'd. O, dool an' wae! My dream's been rede right soon! Yestreen I dream'd twa mice had hol'd the moon. Gaf. The swurd o'Justice never fa's unwrought for, But come,âalive or dead, let's seek our Dochter. Muir. I'll no' be weel this monthâO, what a fright! I'll no gang owre the Muir, my lane, this night. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A briery bank, ahint a broomy knowe, Our youthfu' loving Couple hid frae view, Their vows renew, an' here wi' looks sae sweet, They set their tryst whare neist again to meet. Jean. My heart shall ever-gratefu' bless the Laird, Wha shew'd my dearest Harry such regard, Restor'd you to our hills an' rural plain, Frae war's fatigues safe to my arms again. Harry. Remote from bustling camps and war's alarms, Thus, let me ever clasp thee in my arms. Jean. But,âhere, my Lad, we darna' weel be seen, Dear Harry! say, whare will we meet at e'en? SONG Set to Music by Mr. Ross, of Aberdeen. Harry. We'll meet beside the dusky glen, on yon burn side, Whare the bushes form a cozie den, on yon burn side, Tho' the broomy knowes be green, Yet, there we may be seen, But we'll meetâwe'll meet at e'en, down by yon burn side. I'll lead thee to the birken bow'r, on yon burn side, Sae sweetly wove wi' woodbine flow'r, on yon burn side, There the busy prying eye, Ne'er disturbs the lovers' joy, While in ithers' arms they lie, down by yon burn side. Awa' ye rude unfeeling crew, frae yon burn side, Those fairy-scenes are no' for you, by yon burn side,â There Fancy smoothes her theme, By the sweetly murm'ring stream, An' the rock-lodg'd echoes skim, down by yon burn side. Now the plantin taps are ting'd wi' goud, on yon burn side, An' gloamin' draws her foggy shroud o'er yon burn side, Far frae the noisy scene, I'll through the fields alane, There we'll meetâMy ain dear Jean! down by yon burn side. Jean. I'll jeer my ancient wooer hame, an' then I'll meet you at the op'ning o'the glen. [Exit, separately. SCENE III. Gaffer's House. With unsuccessfu' search the ghaist-rid three, Hae socht the boortree bank, an' hemlock lee, The nettle corner, an' the rown-tree brae, Sue here they come, a' sunk in deepest wae. Gaffer. Alas! Gudewife, our search has been in vain, Come o't what will, my bosom's wrung wi' pain; I ha'flins think his een hae him mislipen'd, But, Oh! it's hard to say what may hae happen'd. Enter Muirland running. Muir. Preserve's! O haste ye rin,âmak' mettle heels! I saw the dragon spankin' owre the fiel's! (They stop from going out on seeing Jean Enter. Jean. What mak's you stare sae strange! what's wrang wi' Willie? He roars as loud's a horn, tho' auld an' silly. Muir. I'm no' sae auld!âmy pith ye yet may brag on! But Jeanie love! how did ye match the dragon? Jean. Auld bleth'rin' Wight! the gowk's possest I ween.â Gaf. Come, Dochter clear this riddle, whare hae ye been? Jean. Father, rare news; our Laird's come hame this day. His Man ca'd in to tell us by the way, Dress'd in his sodger's claise, wi' scarlet coat, He is a bonny lad fu' weel I wot! Muir. The dragon! he, he, he.âI've been deliered, I'll wear a scarlet coat too when we're married. Gaf. Our Laird come hame! an' safe but skaith or scar? I'll owre an' hear the history o'the war, Us kintra fouk are bun like in a cage up, I'll owre an' hear about that place ca'dâEgypt. I lang to hear him tell a' what he's seen. For four lang winters he awa' has beenâ Wifeâfetch my bonnet that I caft last owk, Here, brush my coat,âfey, Jean tak' aff that pouk. Mir. Toot, snuff! 'bout news ye needna' be sae thrang, Let's set the bridal night afore ye gang. Muir. The bridal night! he, he, he, heâthat's right! The bridal night! he, heâthe bridal night! Jean. I'll hing as heigh's the steeple, in a wudie, Before I wed wi' that auld kecklin' body. Mir. Was mither e'er sae plagued wi' a Dochter! O that's her thank for a' the length I've brought her! (Crying. Gaf. This racket in a house!âit is a shame, I'll thank you Muirland to be steppin' hame. Jean. Auld, swirlon, slaethorn, camsheugh, crooked Wight, Gae wa', an' ne'er again come in my sight. Muir. That e'er my lugs were doom'd to hear sic words! Whilk rush into my heart like pointed swurdsâ Frae me let younkers warnin' tak' in time, An' wed, ere dozen'd down ayont their prime! O, me! I canna' gang,â'twill break my heart,â Let's hae ae fareweel peep afore we part. (He puts on his Spectales, stares at Jean, roars ludicrously, Exit Crying. Enter the Laird attended by Harry. Laird. Wellâhow d'ye do my worthy tenants, pray How fairs good Gaffer since I went away? Gaf. My noble Laird! thanks to the lucky star, That steer'd you hame, safe thro' the storms o'war. Laird. Thanks, honest friendâI know your heart of truth, But for my safety, thank this gallant youth, He sav'd my lifeâto him I owe my fame, And gratitude shall still revere his name. Gaf. May heav'n's post-angel swift my blessin's carry! He sav'd your life!âpreserve me, it is Harry! Thrice welcome lad, hereâgies a shake o'your paw! Ye've mended hugely since ye gaed awa'. Harry. Yes, sodg'ring brushes up a person's frame, But at the heart, I hope I'm still the same. Gaf. Your promise to do weelâI see ye've keepen't.â He sav'd your life! O tell me how it happen't? Laird. 'Twas March the eight, that memorable day Our sea-worn troops all weary with delay, For six long days storm-rock'd we lay off shore, And heard the en'mies guns menacing roar, At length the wish'd-for orders came, to land, And drive the foe back from the mounded strand; Then each a hero on the decks we stood, Launch'd out our boats and speeded all we could; While clouds of sulf'rous smoke obscur'd the view, And show'rs of grape-shot from their batt'ries flewâ A brother Captain seated by my side, Receiv'd a shotâhe sunkâhe quiver'dâdied: With friendly hand I clos'd his life-gone eyes, Our sighs, our tears were all his obsequies. Then, as our rowers strove with lengthen'd sweep, Back from the stern I tumbl'd in the deep, And sure had perish'd, for each pressing wave Seem'd emulous to be a soldier's grave; Had not this gallant youth, at danger's shrine, Off'ring his life a sacrifice for mine, Leap'd from the boat and beat his billowy way, To where I belch'd and struggl'd in the sea; With God-like arm sustain'd life's sinking hope, Till the succeeding rowers pick'd us up. Gaf. Fair fa' your worth, my brave young sodger lad, To see you safe return'd my heart is glad. Ilk cottar round will lang your name regard, An' bless you for your kindness to the Laird. Laird. And when the day's hot work of war was done, Each fight-tir'd soldier leaning on his gun, I sought my brave deliverer, and made An offer, with what influence I had To raise his fortune; but he shun'd reward: Yet warmly thank'd me for my kind regard; Then, as in warmth I prais'd his good behavour, He modestly besought me this one favour, That if surviving when the war was o'er, And safe return'd to Scotia once more, I'd ask your will, for him to wed your Daughter; A manly, virtuous heart he home hath brought her. Gaf. Wi' a' my heart, he has my free consent, Wife, what say ye? I hope ye're weel content. Mir. A Mither's word stan's neither here nor there; Tak' him or no' I'm sure I dinna care. Laird. Accept this trifle as young Harry's wife. (Gives his purse to Jean. Money is no equivolent for life, And take this ring,âgood Mistress here's another, With this I 'nlist you for young Harry's mother. Jean. Excuse me, Sir,âmy lips cannot impart The warm emotions of my grateful heart. Mir. It's goud, it's goud! O yes, SirâI agree. Gaffer, it's goud! Yes, âLove shou'd ay be free.â Gaf. Daft woman cease. Laird. And as for you, good Gaffer, My steward will inform what's in your favour. Mean time, prepare the Wedding to your wills, Invite my tenants from the neighb'ring hills, Then, feast, drink, dance till each one tynes his senses And spare no cost, for I shall pay the expences. Harry. Most gen'rous Sir! to tell how much I owe, I'm weak in wordsâlet time and actions show. Laird. My dearest friendâI pray no more of this, Would, I could make you happy as I wish; From him most benefited most is due, And sure the debt belongs from me to you.â Attend the mansion, soon as morning's lightâ And now my friends, I wish you all good night. [Exit. Harry. Great is his soul! soft be his bed of rest, Whose only wish is to make others blest! Mir. I'll gang to kirk niest Sunday, odd's my life! This gouden ring will vex Glen-Craigie's wife. Gaf. Wifeâfy! let pride an' envy gang the gither, This house I hope will ne'er be fash't wi' either; Ay be content wi' what ye hae yoursel', An' never grudge to see a nei'bour's weelâ But Harry, man, I lang to hear you sing, Ye wont to mak' our glens an' plantin's ring. Harry. My heart was never on a cantier key, I'll sing you one with true spontaneous glee. SONG. Air.ââMy laddie is gane.â From the rude bustling camp, to the calm rural plain, I'm come my dear Jeanie to bless thee again; Still burning for honour our warriors may roam, But the laurel I wish'd for I've won it at home: All the glories of conquest no joy could impart, When far from the kind, little girl of my heart, Now, safely return'd I will leave thee no more, But love my dear Jeanie till life's latest hour. The sweets of retirement, how pleasing to me! Possessing all worth, my dear Jeanie in thee! Our flocks early bleating will wake us to Joy, And our raptures exceed the warm tints in the sky; In sweet rural pastimes our days still will glide, Till time looking back will admire at his speed, Still blooming in Virtue, tho' youth then be o'er, I'll love my dear Jeanie till life's latest hour. Enter Muirland. Muir. That's nobly sung, my hearty sodger callan! I've heard you a', ahint the byre-dore hallan; I see my fa'ts, I've chang'd my foolish views, An' now I'm come to beg for your excuse, The sang sings true, I own't without a swither, âAuld age an' young can never gree the gither.â I think, thro' life I'll mak' a canny fen', Wi' hurcheon Nancy o'the hazle-glen; She has my vows, but ay I lat her stan', In hopes to won that bonny lassie's han'; O foolish thought! I maist cou'd greet wi' spite, But it was sleeky luve had a' the wyte: Nae mair let fortune pride in her deserts, Her goud may purchase han's, but ne'er can sowther hearts. Gaf. The man wha sees his fa'ts an' strives to men' 'em, Does mair for virtue than he ne'er had haen 'em; An' he wha deals in scandal only gains, A rich repay of scandal, for his pains: Ye hae our free excuse, ye needna' doubt it, Ye'll ne'er, for us, mair hear a word about it. Muir. That's a' I wish'd,âI cou'dna bide the thought, To live on earth an' bear your scorn in ocht; My heart's now hale,âye soon shall hear the banns Proclaim'd i'the Parish Kirk 'tween me an' Nanse; I'm no' the first auld chield wha's gotten a slight,â I'll owre the muir,âsae, fareweel a' this night! [Exit. Gaf. Of a' experience, that bears aff the bell, Whilk lets a body rightly ken' himsel'. Jean. May lasses, when their joes are far frae hame, Bid stragglin' wooers gang the gaits they came, Else aiblins when their moonshine courtship's past, They'll hae to wed auld dotards at the last. Mir. Gudewives shou'd ay be subject to their men; I'll ne'er speak contrar to your will again. Gaf. That's right, gudewife,âI'm sure I weel may say, Glen-feoch never saw sae blest a day. Young fouks,âwe'll set the bridal-day the morn,â But Lucky, haste bring ben the Christmas horn, Let's pour ae sacred bumper to the Laird, A glass, to crown a wish, was never better wair'd. Harry. While I was yet a boy, my parents died, And left me poor and friendless, wand'ring wide, Your goodness found me, 'neath your fost'ring care, I learn'd those precepts which I'll still revere, And now, to heav'n, for length of life I pray, With filial love your goodness to repay. Gaf. This sacred maxim let us still regard, That âVirtue ever is its own reward.â And what we give to succour the distrest, Calls down from heav'n a blessing on the rest.</field>
