      <field name="fulltext">THE DEATH OF DARNLEY, A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO MISS JOANNA BAILLIE. Dear Madam, In dedicating a Volume of Tragedies to the Author of the Dramas on the Passions, who can be more aware, than I am, of the hazardous comparison to which I subject myself? that consideration, however will not deter me from thus publicly expressing my high admiration of your poetic powers, and the enjoyment that I have long experienced from a friendship, which has convinced me that the qualities of your heart enhance those of your genius. WILLIAM SOTHEBY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Men. Henry Darnley, King of Scotland. Earl Bothwell. Earl Morton. Earl Ruthven. Sir Thomas Randolph, Embassador of Elizabeth. David Rizzio, Foreign Secretary to Queen Mary. Lindsay, Confident of Rizzio. Siward, Servant of the Queen. John Hepburn, Servant of Bothwell. John Hay, Servant of Bothwell. Herman, a page, Servant of Bothwell. Lords, Guards, Heralds, &amp;c. &amp;c. Musicians, Dancers. Women. Mary, Queen of Scotland. Countess of Argyle, the Queen's natural sister. SCENE, Edinburgh and its suburbs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Antichamber of Rizzio's Apartment at Holy-rood. The Stage crowded with Courtiers and Suitors. Two of Rizzio's Gentlemen Ushers. 1 Gent. Look how they press: their clamorous noise confounds me. All suitors? 2 Gent. YesâYou are but new in officeâ 'Tis ever thus: hither, at dawn of day, All hasten, ere our Lord, high-honour'd Rizzio, Goes forth to greet his sovereignâ 1 Suit. [Presenting a petition to the Gent. U.] SirâI prayâ 2 Suit. My suit isâ 3 Suit. Andâsirâmineâ 4 Suit. Hear, I beseech youâ 2 Gent. Peace, sirs, such clamour would awake the deadâ Think you by thus outvoicing all the rest To gain respect? You do forget yourself, Nor pay due honour to Lord Rizzio's state. This is no place for brawlingâ 1 Suit To your kindness Let me commend my suit: if you but whisper The name of Ronald to lord Rizzio's ears, Claim me for life your debtorâ 2 Gent. Silenceâsilence! Lord Rizzio comesâ [Folding doors flung open. On Rizzio's advance, all in silence bow before him. After a pause, a Suitor speaks aside to the 2 Gent. Usher.] 1 Suit. Forget me notâ 2 Gent. My lord, This much-deserving manâ Riz. [interrupting him.] I ask'd not of himâ If justice urge his suit, 'tis freely granted, If not, who pleads his cause, bears my displeasure. Courtiers. Freely command us. Riz. [Aside.] Worthless allâI know themâ Deem they me proud? 'tis their servility, And they must reap its bitter fruitâcontempt.â I thank your zeal, and, I beseech you, sirs, Bear me not blame that I reject your service: My gracious sovereign's bounty far o'erpays His servant's utmost efforts. Suitors. [presenting petition.] Deign to cast On these our humble suits an eye of favour. Riz. [to a servant.] Receive, and in my chamber duly place them. They shall not be neglectedâ Our gracious sovereign will each wrong redress: Each merit recompense.â[Ruthven enters. Earl Ruthven here! 'Tis an unlook'd for honourâ Ruth. Bid these hence: We must have secret conference. Riz. My friends, Retire! [All but Rizzio and Ruthven depart.]âMy lord, I scarce can doubt the cause Which brings you at this hour to Rizzio's roof; Nor would I lightly hazard your displeasure: But, if your wordâI mean not to offendâ Breathe aught disloyal, aught that slightly touches The honour, peace, nay pleasure of my sovereign, Spare me the utteranceâ Ruth. If to reconcile Her father's son, the brother of her blood To his high-honour'd sovereign, if to bring The sigh of deep repentance to her ear, If to lay prostrate at her throne, the chieftain Whose power has strength to shake it, deem you this Disloyal or ungrateful, I will spare you Th'unwelcome utteranceâ Riz. I entreat you, speakâ Ruth. I will not idly dwell upon the past; Fierce feuds, and civil wars that long have fill'd The realm with woe.âEnough, that now Earl Murray, Mov'd by just sense of his acknowledg'd errorâ Riz. [interrupting.] His guiltârebellionâ Ruth. To his sov'reign's mercy Submits, if Rizzio, by strong motives sway'd, Will plead in his behalfâThe hour's most urgent: This day, the council meet, the states, to-morrow: The ban and proclamation are gone forth; Earl Murray must in person now appear, Answering the accusation, or await A traitor's doom. Your counsel, sir, all know it, Much moves the sovereignâName your terms, command them, Wealth, office, honoursâHere we are aloneâ Take this rare gem, [offering a ring.] sure pledge of Murray's friendship, And mine, and Morton's favour. Riz. No, my lord; I will not touch that pledgeâyet, would to heav'n That Rizzio's words had power to reunite The realm in bonds of peace! But, how persuade The queen to look on Murray? Tho' her soul Incline to mercy, yet, too freshly bleeds The wound inflicted by a brother's handâ Deep weighs upon her heart that day, when Murray, Her father's son, her once-lov'd brother, rais'd His arm in battle, from her realm to drive His sovereign, and with murderous hand unthrone The youth her soul adores. Ruth. Rizzio, reflect, Tho' keen your glance, and vers'd in courtly ways, It cannot read the heart. Those worshippers, Light flutterers in life's sunshine, on whose lip Insidious flattery speaks in borrow'd smiles, Will in your need forsake you.âSir, Earl Murray Has powerful friends, while you, in this rude realm, By jealousy and hate encompass'd, dwell A solitary stranger? Riz. Courts Earl Ruthven A solitary stranger? Ruth. Hear, rash man! Take Ruthven's proffer'd hand, or dread his vengeance. Rizzio, the choice is thineâ Riz. Noâhonour, duty, Faith, gratitude, forbidâThe Earl's return Would but revive a flame that must be quench'd In royal blood. Ruth. Art thou resolv'd? Riz. I am. Ruth. Ill-fated man! be Murray now restor'd, Or, I forewarn thee, slave, when next we meet, Beware of Ruthven. [Ruthven goes. Riz. Ha! Messenger enters. Mes. My lordâthe manâ His name I know notâHe, who oft, in secret, By night here meets you, seeks admittance. Riz. Go Conduct him hitherâ[Mess. returns with Lindsay. Henceâ[to the Mess. We are aloneâ[to Lindsay. Speak freely, faithful Lindsayâ Lind. Look on this, [a paper.] My lord, ere yet you seek the royal presence, Strictly peruse this statement: it concerns More than yourself: a kingdom's weal's at hazard. Riz. [perusing the statement.] Earl Murray, and Elizabeth conjoin'd! [Reads on.] Morton and Randolph leagu'd!âPerfidious traitors! Lind. Soon shall their guilt be manifest. Riz. Good Lindsay! Thro' all their wiles pursue them, and expose To the clear light of day the dark recesses Of Morton's guileful mindâTrace out this plot, And claim of me large recompenseâ Lind. My lord; My friends, tho' few, are firm and eagle-ey'd. There are, 'neath Morton's roof, men gained by gold, Who move at my disposal.âIf I err not You shall obtain, ere night, ere close of council, Sure proofs of their conspiracy. [Lindsay goes. Riz. Farewellâ How? how escape their vengeance?âI must perishâ My spirit is o'erpower'd: guile after guile, Treason on treasonâHere, designing Randolph, Fit instrument of dark Elizabeth, In compact with insidious Morton, labours My sov'reign's vow'd destruction: daring Murray There meditates fierce inroad on her kingdom. Without, impending horrors, and within Factions and feuds and treacheryâBarbarous realm! Farewell! Where'er I pass, hate, envy, malice Pursue my step, and every blameless deed Brand with unjust detraction.âI'll departâ But how bid thee farewell; thou, o'er whose sceptre In vain sweet Mercy bends, attempering justice: Thou, who o'er this dark realm in vain pour'st forth The bright illumination of thy soul, A sun that gleams on frozen solitudes, Lighting up tracts of horror: gracious mistress! How leave thee to their wiles? YetâRizzio's murder Beneath thy palace roof would fill thy soul With horror and deep anguishâBe thou spar'd That aggravated woe! I'll quit the realmâ Yet, ere I go for ever, tho' each word Will pierce her heart, yet must I bear, perforce, The king's contemptuous answerâmuch-wrong'd sov'reign! How will the scene which ends thy suff'rings close? [Exit. Scene changes to Bothwell's House. Bothwell. Both. Deem they, dull fools, that Bothwell tamely labours To work their petty ends? A crown I grasp at, And her who wears it: no light acquisition, Nor by light deeds achiev'dâday after day Matures my high-rais'd hopesâCan Scotland's queen, Whose peerless charms and rare accomplishments From the wide world claim homage, still submit To cold neglect, and the capricious humours Of a vain stripling? who now likes, now loaths, Shifting his fancies with each transient moment. Where now his haunt? not with his beauteous consort In royal palaces: yon lonely roof Conceals this phantom king: his guards, the grooms That wait on his low sports; the hawk and hound, And the field's idle labours.âCrafty Morton! I know thee well, that thou canst sound the heart And draw its secrets forth:âthou dost suspect My daring aim: thine too has not escaped meâ My power must aid them: Bothwell's pow'r must compass Earl Murray's pardon, yea, and their advancement. Shall I then meanly limit the reward That waits such service?âThey shall crown my hope To its o'erflowing height. Page enters. Page. My lordâ Both. Well, boy! Page. The masque but waits your wordâI hear the prelude, Shrill pipe and tabret temper'd to the ring Of harp and cymbal, and melodious swell Of the sweet-voic'd recordersâ Both. Go, my boy, Awayâand like wing'd Zephyr quaintly rob'd, Lead the gay masque, and on the Queen's approach These rhymes present: [gives him a letter:] and say, âthe crowned Moor Who yesterday, at tournay, in her presence, Unhors'd the giant Frenchman, and proclaim'd Proud Scotland's Queen the peerless flow'r of beauty, Making the challeng'd field confess her charms, Now, as a slave, sues at her feet to lay The envied prize.â Away. Page. [Running off.] This will delight her. [Exit. Both. Were it but this, it were an easy taskâ But not by sports and revels, not by show And mimicry of combat, tilt and tournay, Must Scotland's Queen be won: by ruthless war, By deeds more fell than battle, deeds of murder, That prize must be achiev'd, if true the beldam Who watch'd my fated birth, and o'er my cradle Mutter'd strange horrors. Hepburn enters. Hepburn!âWherefore here? Why thus uncall'd? Hep. The cause, my Lord, I trow, Will more than justify my bold intrusion. The gray-hair'd man, the shepherd, that fam'd seer, Whom you in vain so oft have sought to question, Is once again return'd. Both. Mean you hoar Donald? Is it indeed gray Donald? Hep. 'Tis that shepherd, He whom we call the Prophet of the Isles. His beard is whiter than the new-fall'n snow. He is once more return'd: all flock around him! And some bow down before him: yet there are Who cannot bear his aspect, when he fixes His broad eye on them. Both. Why not here?âYou knew How anxiously I sought him. Hep. Good, my Lord, I did entreat him earnestly; I said, A Lord of pow'râI did not name Earl Bothwell, Would lavishly reward him. He replied not, But shook his silver locks, and seem'd to smile Half pitying, half in scorn. Both. Bid Hay close watch His pathâPrepare my Moorish robes; and, Hepburn, Let all my train be summon'd to attend me In Eastern pompâAway [he goes.]âThat seer, hoar Donald, All know it wellâthe kingdom far and near Yet rings of itâdid speak of Beaton's death, Yea, and the manner of the cardinal's murder, Ere he who shed his blood had plann'd the deed. He comes in happiest hour: he shall unfold Th'uncertain issue of these dark events, Morton enters unperceived. Shall speak of Bothwell's crown, of Bothwell's wedlock With his soul's sovereign. Mor. [overhearing him.] Ha! 'tis as I thought. I'll break the charmâHealth to the brave Earl Bothwell. Both. Earl Morton! Pardon my uncourteous seemingâ ForgiveâI heard you notâ Mor. No, you were list'ning To your own words: words that the heart discloseâ Bewareâ Both. My lord, how mean you? Mor. Nayâbut this, That Bothwell's inmost thoughts are known to all. Both. Are they so common that the public tongue May freely descant on? Mor. The very stones That pave our city ring of gallant Bothwellâ Ask them whose trumpet summons to the tournay, Enquire who gives the festival, who leads The gay carousal, whose fleet maskers flash Like sun-beams up and down the dazzled streets? One answer cries, âLord Bothwell.ââ Both. Truce, my lord, No more of thisâ'Twas not for this, I know, To waste the idle hour, and loosely prattle Of revelry and feast, and gay carousal, You brake upon my privacy. Mor. 'Tis true. You know the wish that day and night here weighs. Both. Yesâto recal Earl Murray. Mor. And in this I seek, my lord, your powerful aid. In fame, In wealth, in arms, what chieftain equals Bothwell? Whose voice more sways our sovereign queen? Both. Whose? Rizzio's. Mor. At the approach of Bothwell's foot, that worm Shall shrink beneath the earth. Both. But first 'twill sting me. Mor. If by unmanly terror you invite it. Both. Unmanly terror! are those terms well weigh'd? Is it Lord Morton's wish to rouse my anger? Mor. Yes, to its utmost swell: till it o'erflows, And like a flood resistless sweeps away All that obstructs its fury. Both. Cease this trifling. What would you with Lord Bothwell? Mor. That Lord Bothwell, As friend to friend, would bare his heart to Morton; Do but confide in me, and I will steer you To your soul's haven. Both. Plainly speak. Mor. The king Affects you much. Both. The king, my Lord, 'tis true, For that I love the chase, and with him commune In well-bred phrases of the hunter's craft, Of goss-hawk and of grey-hound, and can wind Smoothly the bugle horn, and know the coverts Where harts are harbour'd, and the roe-buck bedded, Frequents my company. What then! Mor. My Lord, Look on these bonds. I every word have weigh'd With cool and cautious foresight. This confirms Ambitious Darnley's high-rais'd hopes, and binds us To fix and guard the matrimonial crown On his boy-brow: this we must sign. The other By Darnley sign'd, assures the exile's pardon, And to Earl Murray, all his former honours, And princely pow'r. The rest, of course, ensues, Our favour and advancement. Move, thou canst, The king to sign it. Both. Well we know, that crown Is Darnley's fix'd desire: but how persuade him To fetter his free hand, and here be branded Our titled slave? Mor. One artful wordâ'tis done, A look would fire him. Teach his eye to glance On Rizzio's favourâandâif hints avail not, Dwell on his fair queen's minion. To procure That minion's murderâif I rightly reckonâ The king would sign the bond. Both. His hand shall sign it. To Murray and his friends I am inclined: You shall not doubt my zeal. With this good sword, At hazard of my life, I would make smooth His way to all his pow'r, so, in return, Earl Murray and his friends wouldâ Mor. [interrupting.] Favour Bothwell. I am his pledge, I answer for Earl Murray. What are thy views? Both. When Darnley enter'd Scotland, What was his wish? Mor. To wed the queen. Both. No doubt. And is it not, I pray, most right and fitting, That he who weds the queen, e'en at his pleasure Should rule the kingdom, if his rule restore The Earl and his adherents, and advance To pow'r and honours those who hold your faith: Andâfurtherâby the royal seal assure To you, my good Lord Morton, and your followers, The abbies rich possessions. Is not this Fit rule and government? and such a ruler The idol of your worship? Mor. Such a ruler Would prove a nation's blessing. Both. Furtherâsay, Should death untimely sweep this Darnley off, Would you not kindly urge my suit to sooth The beauteous mourner's woe, and her fair hand Ease of the sceptre's weight? Mor. The crown and sov'reign, If Ruthven's, Morton's, Murray's pow'r avail, Shall grace Earl Bothwell. Both. Hand to hand, my lord, We understand each other. Nowâfarewellâ I now in eastern pompâsuch this day's sportsâ Seek whom my soul adores. [Bothwell goes.] Mor. 'Tis death thou seek'stâ Bothwellâbeware. Beneath thy flow'ry path, On watch, with gasping throat, and eye of fire, A gilded serpent lies. There shalt thou perish, Proud man! and on thy ruin Murray tow'r. END OF ACT THE FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Queen's Apartment. Groups of Musicians, Singers, Dancers. Bothwell's Page habited like Zephyr. Page. This is the order. At the queen's first entrance, In silence lay your garlands at her feet, Thenârise at waving of my wand. Andâyouâ [Addressing the different groups. With lute, and cymbal, and the soft-breath'd reed, Salute her: youâattemper'd to the music, Match your clear notes: and, you, my sprightly play-mates, In cadence to the song and music, mix Your fleet steps in the many-figur'd dance, Where Zephyr sports with Flora. [The Queen and Countess of Argyle enter in state, with a courtly retinue. At her entrance the masque of Zephyr and Flora begins. The Queen on her throne at first looks on the dance, but soon sinks back in seeming woe.] C. of Ar. A rare masque! My gracious sov'reign! deign to view their revels. See, like gay-coloured clouds that float around The sun's bright car, their light limbs glance before us, One gracious look vouchsafe them. Page. [To the maskers.] Here pay homage. [Kneels to the Queen. They all kneel. Ariseâblend, blend anew the foot and voice! C. of Ar. [To the Queen.] Such revels once had pow'r to fill your fancy With sprightliest images. Queen. [After a long pause.] Why are ye fled, Ye days so fair, so fleet, that o'er me gleam'd Like an enchanted dream? Why fled away And never know return? C. of Ar. Cease, cease the danceâ The queen is troubled. Queen. Bear with me, my sister. Tho' on my ear their song breath'd melody, Sweet as the night's lone warbler's, tho' the dance Of fabled fairies on the moon-light dews, Scarce quaintlier than their circles, yet these sports But breathe of pleasures past, and on the heart Press like an added misery. With such revels, Such winning fantasies, Love woo'd my smile In the green bow'rs of France. [To the maskers.] Thanks, gentle friends! Let not th'untimely woe that dims my day, Eclipse your cloudless sun-shine Say, fair page, Or, must I rather name you the wing'd herald That welcomes in the spring? Say, gentle Zephyr, Whose is this brave device? Page. [Page kneeling presents Bothwell's rhymes.] Hereâroyal lady, These rhymes may haply tell. The crowned Moor, Who yesterday at tournay, in your presence, Unhors'd the giant Frenchman, and proclaim'd Proud Scotland's queen, the peerless flow'r of beauty, Making the challeng'd field confess her charms, Now, prostrate at her foot-stool, sues to lay The envied prize. Queen. Such suit was ne'er denied. [Page goes out. [Bothwell, as a Moorish king, enters with a stately retinue, kneels, and lays the tournay prize at the Queen's feet.] Queen. Rise, gallant Moor! and, if a lady's plume May grace a warrior's helm, and if you deem The conqueror repaid, whom Scotland's queen Her champion names, champion of Scotland's queen, Earl Bothwell, rise! Both. My wealth, my power, my friends, My life, my soul, command them. May I bid These from your presence? Queen. Wherefore? Both. I would fain Alone address you. 'Tis no idle speech That claims my sov'reign's ear. Queen. Another time. Both. Danger and death surround you. Queen. I can front them. Both. Bothwell shall guard his sov'reign. Royal lady, The traveller who haunts untrodden wilds Where fierce beasts prowl, at every step, by day Casts round his path fear's searching glance, at night Circles his couch with fire. Full fain would Bothwell Be to thy day a sun, whose beam before you Lights all the way: and, ever-more by night Watch as th'undying flame, that o'er the altar From profanation and rude touch unblest, Guards the adored image. Rizzio enters. Queen. Rizzioâ Have you then seen the king? Riz. I bear his words. The public must not hear them. Both. [Aside.] How she greets him! Seeâinterchange they not familiar smiles? Insidious sycophant! Queen. Go, faithful Rizzio, Say to that gallant knight, a fitter time May claim his audience. Riz. My Lord Bothwellâ Both. [Interrupting him.] Cease I mark'd each word: you need not echo it: 'Twill not receive new graces from your utterance. Your champion, [to the Queen.] at the council, gracious lady, Will so sustain your throne, that Scotland's queen Will not, methinks, there chase him from her presence. Stranger! [To Rizzio.] beware: the natives of this realm Are a proud race. Our nobles brook not tamely The rule and nod of minions. [Bothwell and Maskers depart. Queen. Go, my friends! Leave me with Rizzio. Gentle Countess, stay: To thee my soul its inmost thoughts entrusts. Speakâ[To Rizzio.] nought conceal. Riz. 'Twill stab you to the heart. Queen. Perpetual woe has chill'd it. I had once A heart that keenly felt. Oh Darnley, Darnley! Look on me, I entreat you, as a flow'r On whose fast-fading leaves, ere fully blown, The snow-storm has descended, and sore shatter'd In its first fragranceâOn its stalk it withers Reckless of show'r and sunshineâSuch I am Thy sovereign bids thee speak.âWhy pause? Riz. The king Is link'd with traitorsâandâ Queen. [interrupting him.] Bad men deceive him; Not yet this heart is stoneâWhy quit me, Darnley? Why leave the shelter of these guardian arms? And will he not comply with my request? Not that lone roof abandon? It disgraces Alike his state and mineâ Riz. The king no more Returns to Holy-roodâ Queen. What then am I? Some loathsome object?âButâHe loves you notâ Ho! Siwardâ Siward enters. With this man, this skillful horseman, Alone of all the train who tend my person Will he at times deign conference. Go, Siward: With reverenceâwith entreatyâwith submissionâ And, is it come to this?âBad men betray himâ Oh! he is new to life, in the first bloom Of guileless youth, quick-passion'd, slightly mov'd, And in the world's dark mazes all unskill'dâ I will not leave him to their wiles a preyâ My prayers, my tears may move himâI must see him. Once, once his Mary's voice had pow'r to sway him: Again these arms shall shelter him, again My Henry on this bosom shall repose. Sayâ Siw. Whom must I address, my royal mistress? Queen. Did I not name your sov'reign? Go, good Siward, Address the king: Entreat him to return: say, that all honour, Proud retinue, and pomp, and royal state Shall gratulate his comingâ[Siward goes.] This, at least Will sooth his prideâHis pride!âand what am I? To be rejected, scorn'd!âUngrateful youth, Hast thou forgotten all? Thy words, thy vows Yet vibrate on my heart: each graceful feature Still warmly glowing there.âRizzio, you urg'd not With fondness my request, but coldly bore A tutor'd speechâ Riz. Noâfervently I urg'd itâ Zeal lent my lip its eloquenceâIn truth I could not choose but say, how leave those charms, Charms, which uncrown'd, unscepter'd, well might move The masters of the world to wage fierce contest. I could not choose but say, who hails his sovereign, The proudest chieftain who draws nigh the throne Feels honour'd in his homageâThen I dwelt On Arran, Scotland's heir, whose eagle eye Gaz'd on the sun, till reason all-o'erpow'r'd Melted beneath the blazeâWhile yet I spake, The king, who first all graciously, methought, Had bow'd his ear, while from his eye-lid stole A tear of fond regret, on sudden fir'd By scornful rage, exclaimed, âSlave, tell thy mistress âThe king prefers yon solitary roof âTo Holy-rood's polluted court, the haunt âOf low-born minionsâ Queen. Ha! Riz. [Aside.] I'll quit the realm: Rizzio shall never give her soul displeasureâ I liv'd but in her sun-shine.âGracious mistress, Whose kindness ne'er thy servant's pray'r denied, Now grant my last requestâ[kneels.] Queen. Why kneel? Ariseâ You, you alone of all who court my favour I still have found most loyal.âWhat thy suit? What wish youâwealth, or pow'r, or added honour? Demand itâ Riz. Noâobscurity and peaceâ I pray your patienceâHe, who now entreats you, Had birth 'mid rocks and mountains, on whose brow Th'eternal snows have rest, in a green vale Where shepherds tend their flocks, in the brief season When summer looks on Alpine solitudes. Lady, the birth-place of the mountaineer Is twin'd around the heartâWe may, at times, In the pursuit of wealth and pow'r, forget it, But 'tis within the heart: and if, perchance, We hear the horn that call'd the herd to pasture, Or catch a rude note of the green corn-pipe That breathes our native melodies, each day Hour after hour, consum'd by fond regret We waste away, no more revisiting The spot where first our naked footstep sportedâ Do not deny me: let me there return, And close the remnant of life's troublous day In privacy and peaceâ Queen. None left on earth In whom my soul may blamelessly confide? Arm'd guards my state surround, beneath my sight Where'er I gaze obsequious courtiers kneel, And wide and general as the air, the breath Of flatterers hails my presence; yetâin these I trust not. On thy saith I firmly rested: Wilt thou desert thy sovereign?â Riz. Never, never; Here let me rather die.â Queen. What mean you, Rizzio? Riz. ThisâThere are men, beneath your palace roof, Whose daggers will leap forth at sight of Rizzioâ How shall I 'scape their malice? Queen. First their daggers, Shall drink their sovereign's bloodâ Siward enters. Ha! Siward! speak. Siw. If, seeming harsh, let not your servant's words Offend youâI but speak the king's command. Sayââthat my fix'd resolve to her is known, âMy will, in this, unchang'd, unchangeableâ âButâthat if Scotland's queen this day, at council, âObey my word, and at the assembled states âFix on my brow the crown: I will return: âElseânever.â Queen. Fix upon his brow the crown!â Would that I might: and that the glowing image Which fir'd my fancy, were no vain illusion! Angel! that guard'st this empire, hear my pray'r! Make the exalted youth, by me ador'd, The idol of a nation: gift his soul With pow'r to sway a realm: that I may take The crown from off my brow to grace his temples, And greatly glory in my self-abasement Height'ning his exaltation!âScotland's crown Is no vain toy to deck the brow of beauty. 'Tis heav'n's high charge: a proud inheritance From far-fam'd ancestors, king after king, A countless generation. I will guard it. Yea, and transmit its honours to my offspring With undiminish'd lustre. Siward, bear My answer back: say, âthat we meet in council.â [Siward goes. Darnley! thou might'st have wound thyself by kindness Into my yielding bosom. Scornâcontemn meâ Darnley! thou meet'st at council Scotland's Queen. [Exeunt. Scene changes to a Suburb of the City. Donald. Don. I'm o'er-wearied. Old age doth lack repose, and other aid To prop its weakness than this shepherd's crook. My limbs have lost their suppleness, and truly 'Tis the last time that Donald will be found A wanderer from the birth-place of his fathers. My old friends here are gone, the young ones vex And harass me with questions: and some whisper I have a demon, and can raise the dead. Poor silly idlers! here they throng. Common People enter. 1 Man. Say, prophet. Oh you know all. 2 Man. Tell usâ Bothwell enters disguised, and drives them out. Both. Awayâbegone. Don. Why have you driven them hence? Both. Because my soul Seeks commune far beyond their silly natures. I have long sought you. Don. Wherefore? Both. I would fain Hold serious conference with you. You foretold Proud Beaton's death: and, ere the army's flight, Our loss at Solway, when the lords refus'd To serve with Sinclair: andâyou truly addedâ That our brave king, whose front had fac'd a lion, James, would not long that day of shame survive. Time-honour'd prophetâ Don. I am none. You see A simple shepherd. Both. You are rarely gifted With that prophetic quality, which brings The shadowy world, and those that tenant it, As on a living theatre to act Their part before you. Hence, you see me here No common suitor: and, I now entreat you To lift the veil up from futurity, And in the dark abyss of days to come, Point out my fate. Don. Why search it out? Enough, Death and dire woes that make the grave a refuge Wait thee and all mankind: there too shall Donald Rest with his fathers, those who never knew That the prophetic curse hung o'er their child;â Or never had the day that saw his birth Their blessing heard. Leave me. Both. First yield me answer. Don. Misjudging mortal! mark old Donald's warning: Mark what the burden of the woe laid on him: 'Tis mine to view in youth's fair-opening flow'r, Th'untimely worm that wastes it. I beheld My virgin bride, when first I clasp'd her charms, Pale in her winding sheet. And now my mind Is dark with horrors, such as thou must feel, If, ere the hour, thou clearly could'st discern The ills that wait on life. Hast thou a hope? Feed on it: does a wish thy pulse-beat quicken? Indulge it, and thy heart will leap with gladness: Butâwhosoe'er thou art, hear, younger man! The fruits of hoar experience: pass thy days In trust and resignation on heaven's will, But seek not to foreknow what God in mercy Has from man's search conceal'd.â Both. Answer, or meet My vengeful wrathâ Don. Rash man! of him enquire Who in the clay whereon he stampt his image Breath'd a celestial spirit. At his impulse Alone I speakâ Both. Then, can'st thou not, hoar seer, At will call up, retain, dismiss the scenes That prescient float before you? Don. Bid the lake That spreads its mirror mid the range of mountains Draw down the golden sun, when the pale moon And each small star on its dark bosom twinkles: Or back recall the feaster and gay bridegroom When the slow train of burial o'er it flings Its melancholy shadowâShade on shade Succeeds, and passes offâThus 'tis with me; My mind is as the mirror of that water: Before me, forms in swift succession glide, And whispers of the names of men unknown: Some pass away forgotten, some remain Part clear, in part confus'd; others there are Of that impressive nature, that whene'er If but by chance once more I catch a whisper Of names so syllabled, or view in life A glance of those in vision, the whole scene With all th'attendant train of weal and woe Perforce starts up before me. Both. Has the name Of Bothwell, ere so whisper'd, caught thine ear? Don. It rests not on the memory. Both. Has thine eye In vision of the future e'er beheld These features? [Unveils himself.] Don. Henceâbegoneâdark vision, hence! Both. Why groan you? What my fate? Don. Why, man of blood, Why steal you forth in silence and dark midnight? An eye from heav'n beams on thy secret way. The mine is laidâis sprung. Saw you the blaze? The pale moon gaz'd upon it, and withdrew Curtain'd in blood. Heard you the roarâthe crash As of infernal thunder that disjoins Earth's deep foundations? The lone roof, the rock Whereon its strength found rest, in air are vanish'd. There dies the king. Both. By hell, he pictures forth My secret thought. Don. Blow the soft fluteâwith dance, and song, and feast, Bring in the royal bride. So young, so fair; Twice, twice a widow! yet so young, so fair! See how her auburn locks turn silvery grey: Untimely chang'd! see, how the scaffold glows With royal blood. Where art thou, Bothwell?âfled? Thou shield a queen! thou canst not save thyself! Hence, fugitive! hence, pirate! Both. Wretch! be silent. Don. Thy lone sail flaps upon a slumberous ocean. Speed, they o'ertake thee. Both. I will hear no more. Peace, madman! thou wert brib'd to vex my soul. Don. Where is the bridegroom now? Both. What bridegroom! who? Don. They know him not, a stranger to their realm. But I know Bothwell's features in that captive Chain'd in a dungeon, raving. Both. [Drawing his dagger.] Madmanâhence. [Drives him out. Thy grey hairs stand between thee and my vengeance. Ne'er shall the wanderings of a frantic mind Turn Bothwell's spirit from its fixt intent. [Exit. END OF ACT THE SECOND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Near the Kirk of Field. Bothwell. Both. [Pointing to a lone house.] There his lone roofâfit haunt for such a sovereign! King. [Behind the scenes.] Begone, dull fool! Both. He speaks as one in rage. King. [Behind the scenes.] Begoneâfail not to find him. Both. Whence this fury? His roan, perchance, is lame, or favourite falcon 'Scap'd from the mews. And must I calmly witness This boy-king's humours? yes, I like this mood: The easier shall my words pour in his soul The venom that empoisons it. The King enters, habited like a hunter, with attendant Falconers, &amp;c. King. [Speaking to one of his Attendants.] Away. Atten. I do entreat forgiveness. King. By my crown I swearâ Atten. Oh, pardon. King. If you fail to find him, Expect no mercy. Seek me here ere sun-set, Or never more the sun shall find you out, In the dark dungeon where your days shall close. Hence, all, and aid his search. [His Attendants depart. Both. What moves your highness. King. Dull, senseless wretch! that noble animal, With untir'd foot throughout the summer day From sun-rise to the setting of the moon, Searching drop after drop the tainted soil, O'er marsh and moor, thro' the long forest glades, And the dark windings of the under-woods, Would trace the wounded deer, and singly hold At bay the antler'd stag. [To Bothwell.] You know my favourite, The far-fam'd blood-hound, which the king of France, My brother, when he deck'd me with this order, Sent with Lord Rambouillet: his choicest breed, The staunchest of his pack: that senseless churl Loos'd him, but now, in very wantoness: He's gone, and none know whither. By my faith, I shrewdly do suspect some purse-proud abbot, Far fonder of the chase than matin pray'r, Has brib'd the villain. Both. Pray you, be compos'd, The loss, I grant, is heavy: but there are Objects of weightier moment that demand Your deepest thoughts: andâif your majestyâ King. [Interrupting him.] Bothwell. Both. My liege. King. Was it your masks whose revels Rung thro' our streets this morn? Both. I pray attend. This day the council meets. The cause imports The honour of your crown: and if the king But grant my suit, here on my knee, I swear, Your hand shall wield the sceptre. We will free you From the harsh yoke of a capricious woman: Andâmore degrading than that yokeâno longer Shall the king's will be thwarted by a slave, That sycophantâthat minion. King. Ha! Both. Your pardonâ Her favourite, Rizzioâoneâ King. You seem confus'd, You have close access to her, haunt her palace. Know you why Scotland's queen no more, as once, Yields to my will observance? Both. Who can trace The mazes of a woman's varying fancy? This mood, and that inclines it: and the sex, From mutability itself, extract Strange pleasure. Your fair consort can assume All characters at will, and seem in each As born for that alone. Have we not seen her In the brief compass of a day, at council Wise as Jove's sapient daughter: then, at court In grace and gait a Juno: now, at banquet Like Love's gay goddess crown the cup with joy: Anon on her war-steed like arm'd Bellona, Wielding no woman's weapon? Butâthere reigns Thro' all this pliability of mood, Fix'd in her heartâHow shall I rightly name it? Tasteâinstinctâsympathy? King. Nay, speak. Both. My liege, It cannot have escap'd you. If the queen Catch the sweet concord of harmonious sounds, Or wild note of a natural melody, A reed soft-breathed, or lightly-finger'd lute, How will the sound draw forth her very soul, Till every sense, as touch'd by strange enchantment, Dissolves in sweet forgetfulness: the while On her soft-heaving bosom tears will glide, Shed in delicious agony. My liege, I have forgot the time, tell me, I pray, Since when, the man from Savoy, the musician, Came to this court a stranger. King. [Aside.] Means he that? Sometimesâit came across meâI confessâ If it be so, not hell itself can hold The fiend that rages here. Nayâgive it vent. Both. Your wealthiest nobles envy that man's treasure. King. Give it at once the utterance. Is she false? Both. Who loves the lute or smoothly-breathed reed, Or warble of a dulcet voice, no doubt Cannot dislike the hand which tunes the chord, Or scorn the lip that lends the flute and song Their modulated melody, King. 'Tis clear. Both. What? King. Thou hast said that Darnley's wife loves Rizzio. Give me thy dagger. Both. Not in that hot mood. First, be assuredâthe king hath friends. But, sire, Were it not better, first by soothing flattery, Once more to win your way into her heart? You have of late neglected her. My liege, Your looksâyour smilesâa smile from one so grac'd, May fire the coldest bosomâthen demand, As proof of love, this Rizzio's exile. King. [Interrupting him.] Life. Both. Andâif deniedâthere are bold fiery spirits, Men, whom the minion's insolence and scorn Have grievously offended. One I know, A chief of daring valour. King. Who? Both. Bold Ruthven: Nor hard the task, my liege, to gain his aid. Vouchsafe a gracious look on these: [the Bonds. these bonds, Devis'd by cautious Morton. This secures Your rightful claim, and on your brow encircles The matrimonial crown: and, if th'offence And the king's wounded honour urge the deed, Here, in this bond, shall Ruthven pledge his faith, At thy command, to free th'indignant realm Of that base minion. This, my liege, when sanction'd By your authority, to Murray grants Free grace and pardon. King. Rizzio shall not live. Both. Sign this,âthe minion dies. Be this but sign'd The banish'd lords shall kneel before thy throne, Guilt flings the woman on her husband's mercy, And thou artâsov'reign. King. [Takes the bond.] At the council's close, At entrance of the queen's apartment meet me. The slave shall die: my word shall give the warrant. [Exit. Both. The hope that hung upon my gifted birth In golden prospect, opens fair before me. 'Tis fatedâ'tis decreedâI wed the queen. Let me but grasp the sceptre, fiend of darkness! Nor fraud nor force shall hurl me from the throne. [Exit. Scene the Second. Rizzio's Apartment. Rizzio. Riz. Ere yet the council closeâso Lindsay promis'dâ Their guilt shall be expos'd. The time now urges: Ere this, the lords who favour Murray, all, Now at unwonted hour in council meet, By the king's urgent summons. Hapless youth! How bright thy dawn of day, how clouded o'er By pride and erring passion! ah, that Rizzio Might, at life's sacrifice, confound the traitors That urge thee on to ruin. Lindsay enters. Lindsay! Lind. [Presents papers.] Hereâ Here are the proofs: their guilt is manifest. These are the transcripts of their bonds: observe them: Thus interlin'd by Morton. No light treasure, Nor trivial risque procur'd them. Riz. [Considering them.] 'Tis his handâ I reck not how obtain'd, nor what the bribe That counterpois'd the hazard. Here, at midnight Seek me again. Ho! Servant enters. Let my train be summon'd. If I but gain admittance to the queen, At public council, in the royal presence, These shall convict the traitors. Lind. Nayâbewareâ Your life's at hazard. Riz. Be it sacrific'd. Be Scotland's sov'reign sav'dâlet Rizzio perish! [Exeunt. Scene the Third. The Council Room. The King on his throne, in state. Ruthven, Lords, &amp;c. King. Well met, my lords. Are all assembled? Noâ I ask not of Lord Bothwell: his high charge Awhile delays him: butâEarl Morton absent, No cause assign'd. What means it? well we know His wisdom, his experience, his authority O'er all bear powerful sway. Lord Ruthven, answer, You share his bosom secrets. Morton enters much agitated. Mor. My dread liege, I pray your pardonâno light cause detain'd me. Would that the traitor now in tortures writh'd Before my sight! King. Why thus incens'd? Lord Morton, We are not wont to see you slav'd by passion. Mor. Your majestyâLord Ruthvenâhere, apart. Firm as these are, and faithful to our cause, [They come forward. They must not catch my whisper'd words. King. Speak freely. Mor. The transcripts of those bonds which Bothwell's zeal Gave to your highness, some domestic traitor Has from my roof purloin'd. The public eye Must not glance on them. King. Be compos'd: this bond [Producing it. Is yet unsign'd. Butâif the imperious queen Yield notâher minionâRuthvenâ[Stops in doubt. Ruth. Say, my liege. King. Ere a new day, at midnight, in her chamber, This nightâyou understand me! in her chamber, That very chamber where with lute and song They interchange their love-sighs.

All, save the King, rise: the Queen, in passing to her throne, salutes the King.] Queen. I greet your highness. It was my intent First to have met the council, and here waited The king's arrival. Speak your grace's will, Whether Earl Murray's banishment, or England Shall first engage our care. King. Let England first Be heard, thro' her embassador. Queen. Go, heralds: And duly usher to the royal presence The lord embassador, Sir Thomas Randolph, Bearer of England's terms. Randolph enters in state, and kneels to the throne. Ran. I humbly greet Your majesties. King. My lord, arise, declare Your queen's, our sister's pleasure. Queen. How! her pleasure! King. It needs no tedious preface. Queen. Why compel me To seeming disrespect, or base desertion Of heaven's high charge? My lord embassador, The terms of England's queen must be addrest To Scotland's sov'reign ruler. King. Who am I? Queen. My lordâmy husband, whom I love and honour. But there are public duties which compel The soul to their subjection. I stand here An ancient kingdom's representative, Sole sov'reign of the realm. In me, my nation, 'Tis Scotland must be honour'd. Say, my lord, The purport of your mission. Ran. England's sov'reign Sends health, and love, and amity to Scotland. Be all the past forgotten: peace, henceforth, Perpetual. Other terms than these we seek not, That our beloved sister, Scotland's queen, The king, her nobles, and her states attesting, With her own hand and signature, confirm The peace once vow'd at Edinburgh. Queen. Never. King. It meets our approbation. Queen. Say not so: Repeat not that the king to this consents. 'Tis to resignâmy birthright. Ran. Sov'reign lady, Be this renew'd, and firmly ratified, Thro' me my royal mistress plights her oath, That the free suffrage of her parliament Shall by the laws and statutes of our realm, Determine the succession. Queen. No, my lord: Your parliament may in its balance weigh The subject's petty claims: mine must be weigh'd By him who in his balance pois'd the world, And severing the nations, gave to each Peculiar blessings: to the south, fair suns, The maize, and jocund vine, and fruitful olive: To Scotland, glens, and friths, and heath-clad mountains, And 'mid bleak rocks, bold hands, and dauntless hearts, Freedom and independence. Of that race I sprang: and, first in blood to England's monarchs, If England's queen go childless to the tomb, I claim, what none can change, by right divine The sov'reignty, my birthright. King. [Impatient.] We will sign it; Give me the treaty. A king's hand shall sign it. Queen. If not self-reverence, nor my dignity, Nor Scotland's glory aught avail, yetâHenry! Pause! When thy hand has sign'd that deed of shame, It signs away the rights of one unborn, The sacred rights of one whose lips' first utterance Will call thee father. By that honoured name I now address thee: by that hallow'd union Which heav'n has sanction'd, by those tender ties That twine the infant round the parent's heart: By that which gives the dove and timid hind The lion's spirit to defend their young, Sign not that deed of shame. King! husband! hear me: Father! protect thy child! King. [Aside.] Fix on my brow The matrimonial crownâ Queen. The states confer it. It rests not on my wordâ King. I am thy scornâ Sign thisâor never look to see me more. Queen. Farewell!âThe sovereign may resign her sceptre, The mother never will desert her childâ King. I am resolv'd. A sov'reign thus confirms it. [Signs it. My lords, subscribe this treaty. Who refuse, I hold alike foes to their king and country. [All but Bothwell sign it. Queen. Let me behold their signatures. [Considers them.] Oh! Scotland! All, all but one, have sign'd itâ Both. And that one Had rather from his arm this right hand sever, Than sign a deed dishonouring Scotland's queenâ I may not utter in the royal presence All that my heart contains: but, I will say That, save my lord the king, all else, whate'er Their rank, birth, office, whose recorded names Attest that deed, are to their queen and country RecordedâTraitorsâ Ruth. [starting up.] Traitors!â Queen. [rising.] Peace, Earl Ruthven! My lord embassador, return to England, And bear my words:âthat rather than degrade The pride and majesty of Scotland's crown, The crown of many ages:âere consent To sacrifice the rights of one unborn, The child whose blessed lip first calls me mother, I, at the imperious will of England's queen Would gladly perish.âTo this public insult, [holding up the treaty. This ignominious treaty, in whose record No eye on earth shall e'er again behold My husband's shame, bear back the sole reply That honour warrants. [The Queen tears and scatters the treaty.] ThisâFarewell! with England We hold no further conferenceâ [Embassador departs. Messenger enters. Mes. [to the Queen.] Gracious sovereign! Thy servant, Rizzio, earnestly implores Immediate audience.âSubjects of high import Urge his entreatyâ Queen. Will your grace permit it? King. You favour him in privateâMust he mix In our state secrets? Queen. Favour him in private! The man, tho' lowly born, is highly minded, Wise, zealous, firm, in service strictly faithful: Therefore with liberal and unsparing hand His merits I have recompens'd. Yet, truly, If it displease your highness to admit him, I will in secret hear him. Ruth. [To the king.] My dread liege, The snake that we behold not surest strikes. Let him appear before us. Mor. [Aside to the king.] Grant him audience, Rely on Morton. What this favourite utters Shall turn to his confusion. King. Let him enter.â Rizzio enters. Advance not. Speak thy purpose, and depart. AndâI forewarn you, let the cause, bold stranger, Warrant this rash intrusion. Queen. Faithful Rizzio, Stand nigh my throne. King. Be brief. Riz. I pray your patience: I will not long detain you; nor again Shall Rizzio give the realm and king offence: Forâhaplyâere yon sun has clos'd his course, Nought, save an evanescent name, will mark That Rizzio once had being. Let me then Thus prostrate at your throne, my gracious mistress, Here publicly proclaim, that to your kingdom A low-born stranger came, that on his zeal So shone the royal favour, that this wanderer, This out-cast of the world, who here at last Had found a home, a country, for that country Felt what a patriot feels, and freely offer'd His life a sacrifice to shield the sov'reign, And Scotland's realm from ruin. [Rizzio rises. King! unseal Your eyes: behold the throne encompass'd round With treachery and treason. Ruth. [Starting up, draws his dagger.] SilenceâSlave! Mor. [Staying him, aside.] Not now the time. Riz. [Delivers to the Queen the transcripts of the bonds.] Receive, my gracious mistress, The last, last tribute of thy grateful servant, These bonds. 'Tis Rizzio's farewell legacy. These, underneath Earl Morton's roof, were found. Earl Morton fully can the rest unfold. Mor. How found? Riz. Suffice not these? you see the proofs. Mor. Who brought them? Riz. Never shall my voice reveal His name who brought them. For his truth I answer. Queen. [attentively considering them.] 'Tis Morton's hand. Fix on the king my crown! Recall Earl Murray! does my lord the king Know of these dark designs? Mor. Let Morton answer. These are forg'd instruments. Queen. [To Morton.] I'll prove the truth. Thy faith or guilt shall now be clearly shown. Give him the deed [To the Secretary.] that dooms to banishment Or death, the rebels. As the act of all, Sign it, Earl Morton, elseâthou art a traitor. Ruth. [Aside.] Ere that deed pass, blood, blood shall flow. Mor. [Signs it.] 'Tis sign'd. See Morton's name. Who doubts his loyalty? Queen. [Aside.] I yet suspect his guilt. Riz. This is your hand, My lordâandâ Mor. I'll not answer thee, base slanderer. Ruth. Must we then bear his insolence? arrest him. Wait not the law's slow sentence. Vengeance! Lords. [Drawing their daggers.] Vengeance! Queen. Traitors, desist. Both. Lord Ruthven! curb thy rage. King. Bothwell! Both. My liege! Mor. [Aside to the king.] Let not the king be troubled. Rizzio shall surely perish, but not here. Ruth. [Advancing to strike Rizzio.] Vengeance! Both. [Draws his sword and interposes.] Who strikes that man, encounters Bothwell. Queen. Brave Earl! lead thou the way. Break up the council. [To the King.] And wilt thou not return? King. The crown! Queen. Farewell. Approach, my faithful servantâI will guard theeâ Fear notâwho aims at Rizzio, wounds his sov'reign. [Exeunt. END OF ACT THE THIRD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Queen's Apartment. Queen and Siward. Siw. The king requests a conference with your highness. Queen. Speed, Siward: say, impatiently I wait His welcome presence. [Siward goes.] To this roof return! Thus, unrequested! has the fatal truth Flash'd on his soul conviction? grace, ye saints, My lip with soft persuasion, that each word May breathe of love and bliss, and in his heart Re-animate the spark of heavenly flame That lights the soul to glory. The King enters. Henry! welcome, Thrice welcome to this roof! what blissful cause Thus greets me with thy presence? King. Ask thy heart. Will it not echo mine that oft has sigh'd At our long separation? Queen. Do I hear thee? Can this be mockery? if it be delusion, YesâI will cherish it. King. I am not blameless: Youth, and rash spirits, and th'impatient mind, Are evil counsellorsâ Queen. [Interrupts him.] On all the past Let dark Oblivion rest eternally, While on Hope's brilliant star we fix our gaze, And in the lustre of its light embellish Futurity's fair vision. King. [Kneels and kisses her hand.] Thus I clasp Pardon and peace. Queen. Addâhappiness. Oh, Darnley, I am a very woman, and was cast By nature in that mold, whereinâ'tis saidâ Love forms the female heart. It is thy Mary Whose lip now presses on thy offer'd hand, A kiss more warm than panitence ere sought, Or ever seal'd cold pardon. Yes, my husband, Let me gaze on thee. Art thou not the same As in that blissful hour when first we met? When the preventive voice of fame had rumour'd That heav'n decreed our nuptials: that young Darnley, Of royal blood, of rare accomplishments, In air, in shape, majestic grace and beauty, Sole equall'd Scotland's Mary. Thus we met: And ere my tongue had pow'r to form the utterance, My heart exclaim'd, âon that brave arm, the woman âShall rest her weakness, from that eye of fire, âDraw the keen spirit that shall daunt the rebel, âAnd light a realm to glory.â King. I am thineâ The sun, by looking on the world, creates Fruits and fair flow'rs, and in their hues admires The beauty it imparts. So look on me, And gift me with thy graces. Queen. Henry! Henry! Before thee bright the path of glory beams. Love kindly sever'd us the more to heighten The bliss of reconcilement. King. I am blest. And yet there are cold-blooded men, who doubt If Mary yet love Darnley. Now, confound them. 'Tis not to gratify an idle pride, No vain distinction moves me: what I covet Shall 'stablish by my strength your kingdom's glory. Queen. And can you doubt my prompt compliance? Speak. King. Why does a shadowy sceptre mock my grasp? Why are my brows, as in derision, girt By the crown's glittering bauble? Queen. How? King. Be mine The grace, the dignity, the pow'r that guards The matrimonial crown. Honour thyself In honouring me, thy choice. Queen. [Aside.] Was it for this His lip dropt honey? let me not so deem it. Bewareâit is a dangerous gift: 'tis pregnant With unknown evil. King. Grant, at my entreaty, Grace and free pardon to the rebel lords. Queen. You know not what you ask. Bad men betray you. Seek you the matrimonial crown, and with it Grace and free pardon to the rebel lords, Who from thy brow will rend it? King. I have weigh'd, With cautious fore-sight, weigh'd each word I spoke. If love be firmly rooted in thy heart, If no feign'd passion, now comply. Yetâfurtherâ Queen. [Interrupting him.] Is there aught else? King. A trifleâ Rizzio's exile. Queen. Be that request unsaid. He is a stranger; My smile his sole protection. King. Ha! confess it. I do enforce the word. Cast out the slave. HowâhesitateâI hate the man. That minion, Like a malignant spirit hovers round you. He pays no court to me: in secret thwarts me: In public slights: and shall I tamely brook it? Queen. You know him not. Rizzio reveres his king: And, had he e'er unweetingly offended, Mercy, not vengeance, best becomes a monarch. Yetâif again thou urge it, at thy pleasure Rizzio shall quit the realm. King. Such as he came, A roofless vagrant, stript of all his plunder. Queen. That must not be. It never shall be said, That Scotland's queen to beggary and contempt Cast off her faithful servant. King. Shall this minion To the wide world triumphantly expose The beauteous Mary's gifts, and Darnley's shame? Your cheek has lost its colour. Why thus tremble? By heav'n you love the man. Queen. What means the king? I cannot but esteem him. I have found him Wise, zealous, loyal: and, in time of trouble, When others have abandon'd me, his firmness Gave to my soul new confidence. King. Ha! own'st thou To me thy love? Queen. I am not wont thro' fear or fraud, to veil The feelings of my heart. So have I lov'd him, That I to Darnley and to heav'n avow it. King. Will you not understand me? Queen. NoâI would not. King. I say you love him with unlawful passion. Queen. Go, ill-starr'd youth. King. Why this affected calmness? Queen. Ratest thou a queen's, a wife's, a matron's honour, By thine own base conceptions? hence. King. Adultress. Queen. Shameâshame. King. He shall not live. Queen. I will protect him. King. He dies. Queen. Wrong thou that lone defenceless stranger, And I for ever from my soul cast off Thee, Darnley, and thy memory. King. Thy minion Dies. Bothwell enters. Queen. Bothwell, here! Both. [To the queen.] Methought I heard the queenâ Command me. Queen. Darnley, hence. We meet no more. [Queen goes. King. The bond is sign'd. Swear thou, ere one fleet hour Shall pass away: I know their secret haunt, The private cabinet within her chamber: This master key commands the palaceâBothwell, Swear thou, ere one fleet hour shall pass away, That Ruthven, and Earl Morton, with armed men, In secret, on the threshold of her chamber, Stand watchful of my step, when loud I stamp, To rush before th'adultress, and there strike Her insolent minion. Both. Ruthven shall not fail. King. [Gives the bond to Bothwell.] The bond is sign'd.âEre one fleet hour, all arm'd. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Queen's Cabinet. Servants and Pages setting on the Supper. 1 Serv. They will surprise us, yet, ere all is ready. Dispatch, dispatch. 2 Serv. 'Tis all in order now. Mind how you pass that way: be not too hasty: Be wary of your steps. This scanty room Doth not admit of carelessness. I warn you, Thou luckless pageâif you brush down that lute, Or mar its music: will you not observe me? 'Tis Rizzio's favourite: if a wire but snap, 'Twill much displease the queen. I hear their steps: Let us begone. Queen, Lady Argyle, and Rizzio, enter. Queen. Nayâbrood not in dull gloom. Comeâgentle sister! Rizzioâhereâbe seatedâ I would awhile forget all care and sorrow, And feast on my own fancies. [Aside.] I must feign The mirth I feel not, or my tears will gush.â Sister, give me the lute. Riz. Your words are gayâ Your looks accord not with themâgracious lady! Are you, in deed, in very truth, light-hearted? Queen. Nayâyou yourself shall answer your own question. A memory of my girlish days comes o'er me, I know not why: 'twill help you to an answer. When I was yet a little child, at Paris, One eve, at court, for Henry ever lov'd To list my childish prattle, near him stood A brave old mariner, of slender frame, Keen-ey'd, his cheek by winds and suns embrown'd: His ample forehead in its furrows bore Signs of deep thought, and brunt of many a tempest, Butâon his placid brow sat manifest The spirit that bad storms and death defiance, Calm resolution. Close I noted him: For thoughtless as I seem'd, his tale at once Found to my young heart entrance. Riz. What the tale? Queen. 'Tis simple. In a tempest, nigh the rocks, His native shore, he, sole of all the crew, Dar'd trust his body to the surge that rav'd Among the cliffs. Heav'n crown'd his trust with life. There, as he rested on a rock, he saw Beneath him, in the wide and windless depth Of the huge sweep of the ocean roll, the ship, A wreck, fast sinking: but ere yet the wave Clos'd o'er it, in the momentary pause And lulling of the tempest, on his ear From that deep bosom of the ocean, rose On sudden in one roar of many voices, A wild, yeaâwanton song: as if the men Now certain of their fate, with one consent Had vow'd, ere death, to drown all fear of dying In Bacchanalian chorus. So they perish'd. Say, are you answer'd? Riz. Yesâtoo well. Despair Has forc'd this light mood on you. Queen. Take your lute. Why do you strike those dismal chords? Riz. The hand Betrays the soul. Queen. Come, come, a lighter prelude. How you mock me? The wires are all untun'd, or your strange trembling Mars all their music. Riz. No light air, I pray. Queen. A soothing air, then. Oft the lay of woe Is medicine to deep anguish, as, 'tis said, The honey of the bee will in its wound Assuage the venom. Try my favourite air, Thy modulation to the song that heard The sorrow of my soul, as on the deck Where I had wept all night, at dawn I sat, And strain'd my longing eyes that bad farewell To the gay land that made my young heart joy, To France, fast fading from me. Riz. 'Tis in vain. My soul is out of tune. [The king's step is heard ascending the stairs. Heard you that sound? Queen. What sound? Riz. Again! Queen. Methinks I hear a footstep. Riz. Hark! hark, how heavily it labours up The private stairs. Queen. None here can entrance findâ YetâI distinctly hear itâhowâa key Grates, forcing back the wardsâ C. of Ar. I'll bar the door. The King enters. Queen. Hasteâ'tis too lateâ Riz. It is the king. King. NoâDarnleyâ It is but DarnleyâBe not discompos'dâ There was your seat, your custom'd place. Sit, Rizzioâ Riz. Not in your presenceâ King. In the queen's you sat: She is more king than I am. Slave! be seated. [Forces him to sit. Queen. [aside.] He dares not in my presenceâ King. [to the Queen.] Be not vex'd, That here you see an uninvited guest. [Aside] By this time they are come. Riz. I hear the tread The heavy jarring tread of armed men. King. Heard you their jarring tread? Come, crown your glass, To Mary, Scotland's sovereign, beauteous Mary; And, when I stamp upon the pavement, thus, [he stamps. Drink, drink it down. Ruthven in armour, and armed followers enter. Riz. [to the Queen.] Protect meâsave thy servant! Queen. Yes, at life's perilâWho art thou? Why arm'd? Wherefore that unsheath'd sword? Who art thou? Ruth. [Lifting up his helmet.] Ruthvenâ Queen. Why here, Earl Ruthven? Ruth. To obey the kingâ Come forth, base minionâThou, whose ill-gain'd wealth Makes poor the plunder'd realm; whose insolence Outswells thy base rapacity: whose faith, Hostile to ours, each foreign pow'r prefers To Scotland's weal, and Scotland sonsâCome forth. I, Ruthven, for an injur'd realm claim vengeance. King. Add too, that base-born peasant, that vile minion Has Scotland's king dishonour'dâ Riz. King, 'tis falseâ Queen. [to the King.] Thou dost degrade thyself, dishonouring meâ Earl Ruthven! hence: or dread a traitor's doom. I am thy sovereignâ Ruth. I obey the king King. Strike, Ruthven! Queen. On my knees I beg his lifeâ King. Adultress! noâThy minion dies. Riz. Oh shield me. Queen. [to the King.] Oh! by that life which soon will see the light, Thy unborn babe that at my heart-strings pulls, Save him. [King gives Ruthven a dagger. King. Strike, Ruthven! with this dagger strike himâ Queen. Traitor, desistâ [The Queen rushes before Rizzio. Ruthven and his followers struggle with him. Riz. There is no hopeâno refugeâ King. [seizing hold of the Queen.] Now force him from her. Riz. [to Ruthven.] Cease, barbarian, ceaseâ Grasp not her arms: on her no violenceâ [Rizzio goes, followed by Ruthven. Strike, but not hereâ[to the Queen.] Farewell! farewell! for everâ Queen. Hear, for thy soul's sake, mercy!âRuthven! spare him! Ruth. [Behind the scenes.] Dieâdieâ Riz. [Behind the scenes.] Saints! guard her life. Queen. [to the King.] Hence, ruthless murderer! END OF ACT THE FOURTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Queen's Apartment. Queen and Argyle. Queen. Peace to thy spirit! rest, lamented friend! Ah! hapless Rizzio! dearer to my soul, Now, while I weep thy loss, than in those hours When like a guardian saint, thy keen-ey'd wisdom Illum'd my path: far dearer to my soul, Than when thy converse chas'd away my woe. Or thy persuasive song like breath'd enchantment Call'd fancy from her inmost cell, and fill'd Her visions with sweet wonder. C. of Ar. Be consol'd. Queen. [Seeing Rizzio's Lute.] That lute! ha! take it hence! that was my gift. Conceal it from my sight. [Argyle takes it into the inner room.] Ne'er may I hear Again those chords which once had pow'r to sooth The anguish of my spirit! each vibration, Will ring of Rizzio's loss, of Rizzio's murder, Of Rizzio's groan of death. Argyle enters faltering. C. of Ar. Helpâhelp. I faintâ 'Tis fill'd with armed men, and the fresh blood Yet streams upon the floor. 'Tis Rizzio's blood. Queen. Fear not. They shall not harm thee in my presence. C. of Ar. Not fear! they murder'd Rizzio in thy presence. Queen. Dost thou reproach me too, my sister? C. of Ar. Pardon: I know not what I spake; my fear o'erpow'r'd me. Queen. Their queen, their prisoner! none to aid their sov'reign? I had a husband onceâbut Rizzio's murder Has from my soul eras'd him. Bothwell heard behind the scenes. Guards! depart. HenceâI command you. Queen. Bothwell!âgo, my sister, Entreat him to my presence. [Argyle goes.] Hapless Mary! And must I rest on him? AhâMurray! Murray! My brother, where art thou? in arms, a rebel Against thy queen and sister. Both. [behind the scenes.] Gracious Countess, Say, I will quickly come. Argyle enters. C. of Ar. The Earl but waits To see the body of thy servant, Rizzio, Borne decently away, and that no stain Of murder shock thy sight. Queen. Have they then borne The body off? 'Twould soothing be, tho' painful, To breathe o'er Rizzio's corse a farewell pray'r, A requiem to his spirit. C. of Ar. Go not there: Oh shun that scene of horror. Bothwell enters. Queen. Welcome, Earl! I did entreat your presence. Both. I beseech you Now yield me secret audience. Queen. [Aside to Argyle.] How refuse him? A little while here leave us. Go not far: Speed at my call. [Argyle goes.] Both. A melancholy office, But one I deem'd not thankless to my sov'reign Awhile detain'd me. Pardon my delay. I wait my sov'reign's will. Queen. Say, my entreatyâ Such reverence now seems insult. You behold The sov'reign of your kingdom in her palace, A guarded prisoner! Both. Scotland's queen, a prisoner, And Bothwell living!âAll who bear with me Name or affinity, the meanest hind Of Bothwell's clan, to rescue thee, their sov'reign, Would gladly die. Queen. I still have found you loyal. Both. Ere I beheld your heav'nly charms, I vow'd Faith and obedience unto Scotland's queen: But at my eye's first glance, I freely own That faith, obedience, subject's loyalty But ill exprest my ardour. Queen. Armed men Now fill my cabinet; they watch me, hear me: I am a prisoner. Both. No. At Bothwell's biddingâ Queen. [interrupts him.] At Bothwell's biddingâYour's! Both. They, all, retir'd. Queen. Andâam I free? Both. Command. Queen. Here guard the king, The victim of base traitorsâDarnley! Darnley! How could'st thou doubt my love? Deluded youth! Not thirst of blood, not cruelty of nature, Keen Jealousy's infuriate demon plung'd Thy blade in Rizzio's breast. Both. Seek not to see him: Dark Morton sways his soul. But now I left him Slav'd by his fear, his fitful fury cool'd, The more dejected, like his favourite bird, That in the ardour of pursuit, too far Out-soar'd its wonted flight, then, earthward flutter'd With feebler wing dispirited. Forget him. While here the majesty of Scotland wept Unpitied, unaveng'd, that boyâ Queen. [interrupting him.] Earl Bothwell, He is thy king. Both. Not, since that foul offence, Treason to love and Scotland. Royal lady! All must be known: while here you wept a prisoner, That rash boy sped his missive letters forth, Recalling Murray. Queen. Am I free? Both. The states Are by his will dismiss'd. Queen. I, Scotland's sovereign! Both. No, thou art not: thou must bow down to Darnley, And at his footstool kneel, and supplicate His grace, and sue remission for thy crimes. I have perus'd the deed; 'tis vow'd, 'tis sign'd In Rizzio's bloodâ Queen. What deed? Both. Stern Ruthven, Morton, Have sworn, on Darnley's head to fix and guard The matrimonial crown. Queen. And wrest from me The sceptre? Both. Yes: andâfar more dear to thee Than crown or sceptre, yea than life itself, Thy honor. If thy foe's fell malice prosper, Thy name to after ages shall become A bye-word and contempt. The mother's guilt On the fair front and sinless brow of childhood Shall brand th'adultress' shameâ Queen. Bothwell, begone: Thy presence is offenceâ Both. Thou must attendâ The storm now bursts upon thee, and alone One who has lov'd thee long, but ne'er till now, Till that this hand had strength and power to shield thee, Pour'd forth his soulâ Queen.

Scene changes to a desolate spot, near the Kirk of Field. Hay, Hepburn, with a dark lantern, cloaks, and vizors. Hay. This is the place.âHere, by the ruin'd wall, Where the huge buttress props it up from fallingâ Is it not past the time? Hep. The abbey chimes Have plainly mark'd the hour, 'twixt one and two. Hay. I have watch'd here since midnightâKeen the air: Most piercing cold: the sleet-storm drives apace; And, but for this good mantle, I had lain A frozen corse on earthâAnd, might I speak itâ Hep. [interrupting him.] Hist!âhist! Hay. I know you'll call me woman-hearted, Yet, would that I had lain a frozen corse Ere hazarded this deedâ Hep. Five hundred crowns Twice fairly reckon'd upâone thousand crowns, And an Earl's favour. Thou art woman-hearted. Methinks I heard a foot-fall. No. Hay. 'Tis horridâ From its foundation blow the house in air! And must the king so perish? Hep. That I know not. The Earlâhist! hist! his word will all disclose. Hay. It will be heavy on my soul for ever, Yet his the guilt. Bothwell softly enters. Both. Hist! Hepburn! Hay! make answer. Hep. We wait your will. Both. Where are the vizors? Hep. Here. Both. The mantles? Hep. Here? [holds up the lamp. Both. We must alike be cloth'd. Hepburn, is all as I commanded, done? Hep. Strict to your bidding. Both. And the train drawn out Beyond the wall, close to the garden's edge? Hep. Up to the garden's edge. Touch but the train, The house, walls, vaults, foundation stones, all, all, Vanish in air. Both. 'Tis well. Hay, hast thou done Alike thy part? hast thou to feast and song Entic'd his few attendants? Hay. Ere this hour They stagger in their cups. The king, my lord, Lies at your mercy. Andâmight Iâunblam'd, Whisper one pitying word. Think on his youthâ It is a dreadful deed. Both. Hay, look on this. [Drawing a dagger. Obey, nor speak, save when I give command. Hear my last orders. When the abbey clock Strikes twoâ'tis near the timeâwe, thus disguis'd, Rush to the lonely room, and seize the man, There bind him, and so leave him to his fate. Now, strictly mark me: by your lives I warn you, Utter no word: no sound, no whisper heard. ButâHepburn, when the abbey clock strikes two, When its last echo dies among the hills, I charge you, Hepburn, five fleet minutes pause; That we, fore-warn'd, may ere the mine is sprung, Fly from the spot: then, fire the trainâmean-while At different parts, we round the garden watch That none approach. 'Tis time. Hush, hush, be cautious, The city's nightly guard now walk their round. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the King's-House, in the Kirk of Field. King staggers in alarmed. King. I cannot rest. I will not to my couch. Again it glides before me. Hence! avaunt! Spare me, ye ministers of vengeance, spare me! Was it not palpable? I heard his groan. On me, on me, the spectre turn'd his gaze: 'Twas Rizzio: such I saw him, as he writh'd And hung upon the queen, and gaz'd on me, When Ruthven's quivering dagger gleam'd before him. There, thereâagain it glides before me. Lo! It beckons me to follow. Countess of Argyle enters. What art thou, A spectre, or a being of this earth? Speak to me. C. of Ar. Let my liege behold this ringâ From Scotland's queen I come, and bear her words. Speed, if thou value life: quit this lone roofâ Fly to her arms for refuge. King. Can the queen Forgive the past? Pour on her brow, ye saints, Celestial blessings! C. of Ar. Speed, my lord, delay not. I must not linger here. [Argyle goes. King. Haste. Say I comeâ I comeâI will but fling this mantle round me. Keen is the night-air. Harkâa heavier step Ascends the stairs. Three Persons enter disguised. Who are you? hoâmy train. [After struggling, the King is overpowered. Helpâtreasonâmurderâdo you seek my life? Will you not answer? Is my wealth your aim?â You know me not, a kingdom's wealth my ransom. Bind me not so, so close: I will not struggle, I do not struggle. Sirs, have mercy on me! If you are men, if not infernal spirits, Let me but hear your voices. Say you will murder me: so you but speak it, I know youâRizzio sent you: you are ris'n Fiends from the under world before the time, To torture here your victims. Goneâoh hear me! [They leave him boundâdoor barred on the outside. Murderers, or spirits of the dead, return! Leave me not thus in lonely horror! hear me! So did I turn from Rizzio's piercing cry.â 'Tis dreadful retribution. Blood claims blood. Scene changes to another part of the Garden. Queen and Siward enter with torches. Queen. [Rushing in.] Siward, speed on. I am not wearied! Haste! I care not for the gust and freezing night-air. What was that sound? [The Abbey clock strikes two. Siw. The abbey clock struck two. Queen. I am not wearied. Hold the lamp before me. Speed on. Where art thou, Argyle? why delay? Hark! harkâa footstep. Is it thine, my sister? [One of the persons, disguised, rushes by her. Was I deceiv'd? one in swift pace rush'd by me. Speak, Argyle, speak! Hay rushing in. Hay. Awayâawayâor perish. If that thy life is dear, fly, fly this spot. Queen. Why fly? who art thou? speak. Thy queen commands. Hay. Oh heav'n's! the queen!âaway. The king now dies. Speed, if kind saints yet grant one fav'ring moment. The mine is charg'd, the train is laid. Awayâ A demon counts the moment, Flyâ'tis fir'd. [The mine explodes. The wreck will crush us. Queen. Let me here expire. [Falls on the earth, amid the bursting fragments. THE END.</field>
