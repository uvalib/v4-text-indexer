      <field name="fulltext">ADRIAN IN SYRIA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Adrian, Emperor of Rome, in love with Emirena, but betrothed to Sabina. Osrhoes, King of the Parthians, captive to Adrian, father of Emirena. Sabina, in love with, and betrothed to Adrian. Pharnaspes, a Parthian prince, captive to Adrian, friend and tributary to Osrhoes, betrothed to Emirena. Emirena, captive to Adrian, in love with Pharnaspes. Aquilius, a tribune, confidant of Adrian, secretly in love with Sabina.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, Antioch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A square in the city of Antioch, magnificently decorated with military trophies, consisting of arms, ensigns, and other spoils of the conquered barbarous nations. An imperial throne on one side. A bridge over the river Orontes, that divides the city. On the near side of the river appears Adrian borne in triumph on the shields of the Roman soldiers. Aquilius, guards and people. On the further side of the river Pharnaspes and Osrhoes, with a train of Parthians bringing various wild beasts and other gifts as presents to Adrian. Chorus of Roman Soldiers. Live, live for us, for empire live! On fam'd Orontes' banks receive That laurel which the conquer'd give, Great CÃ¦sar! thus to grace thy brows. Hail! father of a happy land! Hail! leader of a martial band! The world confess thy saving hand: In thee our dearest hopes repose. What wreaths for thee shall Ganges frame, What nations shall extend thy fame From clime to clime, 'till CÃ¦sar's name The earth's remotest region knows! [while the chorus is singing Adrian descends, and the soldiers, who bore him on their shields, fall into their ranks with the rest. Aquil. The Parthian prince Pharnaspes, mighty CÃ¦sar, Requests an audience of thee. Adr. Let him come, He shall be heard. [Aquilius goes out, and Adrian having ascended the steps of the throne addresses the soldiers standing. My friends and fellow-soldiers, You offer me an empire with your blood No less than mine sustain'd. I know not well The right of Adrian to receive alone The fruits of general toil: but if your love Brook no refusal, each of you shall find, (Whate'er my title) Adrian still the same. Nor deem yourselves my subjects: no, together We still, as wont, will serve one common cause, To guard the glories of imperial Rome, Your private honours and the public weal. [he sits. Chorus. Live, live for us, for empire live! On fam'd Orontes' banks receive That laurel which the conquer'd give, Great CÃ¦sar, thus to grace thy brows. [while the chorus is singing Pharnaspes and Osrhoes pass the river with all their train, preceded by Aquilius. Pharnaspes and Osrhoes advance: Pharnaspes addresses himself to CÃ¦sar. Phar. On this decisive day, when Rome adores In thee her CÃ¦sar; from that eye, Augustus, On which depends the fate of many a realm, Vouchsafe to cast one look on prince Pharnaspes. But late thy foe; he now at CÃ¦sar's feet Lays down his enmity, and swears to prove His loyalty and truth. Osr. [aside to Phar.] There needed not Such abject, tame submission. Adr. Rome is ever Each nation's common mother, and receives Within her bosom all that would become Incorporate with herself: her friends she honours, The vanquish'd she forgives; with godlike virtue The oppress'd she raises, and she sinks the proud. Osr. [aside.] O! insolence of power! Phar. I come to ask No unexampled act of Roman virtue The royal daughter of the Parthian king Is now a prisoner in your chains. Adr. Proceed. Phar. Release her from her bonds. Adr. [aside.] O! Heaven! Phar. Dry up Her country's tears; to me restore the maid, And take these gifts for ransom. Adr. Here in Asia I wage a generous war: I come not, prince, To barter gold for conquest: think not Adrian, As is the style of barbarous nations, sells The liberty of others. Phar. Let it then Be Adrian's gift. Osr. [aside.] What now will Adrian say? Adr. First let her father come and claim this gift: For him I have reserv'd it. Phar. Since the day, The fatal day, when all the Gods combin'd Fought in the cause of Rome, our monarch's fate Has still remain'd unknown: in other lands He wanders now conceal'd, or lives no more. Adr. Till Osrhoes' certain destiny be heard, His daughter be our care. Phar. Then since Augustus Appears so jealous of his fame, resign That office to her husband. Adr. Ha! her husband? Is Emirena then espous'd? Phar. No more Is wanting but the solemn rite. Adr. [aside.] O! Heavens! [to him.] Where is that husband? Phar. I, my lord, am he. Adr. And does she love thee too Phar. We lov'd each other Before we knew 'twas love: we learn'd together To live and feed our passion: with our years And ripening sense the flame increas'd: our souls Became but one. I sigh'd for Emirena, She for her faithful prince; but then, Augustus, When blissful Hymen should have made us one, Relentless Fate! then was she ravish'd from me. Adr. [aside.] What do I suffer? Phar. You appear disturb'd. Perchance my weakness may offend: I know The sons of Rome are heroes from their birth: I know that every passion glory breeds not, With you is deem'd a crime; but vainly, CÃ¦sar, You seek to find such virtues in Pharnaspes: I am a Parthian, not a Roman born. Adr. [aside.] O! harsh rebuke! But let us now begin To exercise dominion o'er ourselves. [to Phar.] Hear, prince; the lovely captive shall henceforth Be mistress of her fate: I'll lead thee to her, And if, as thou believ'st, she loves thee still, Thenâhold my heart!âthen take her and depart. On those fair lips that love inspire, That kindled first thy bosom's fire, On them depends thy fate aloneâ And, ah! no less depends my own. [aside. In thy distress I bear a part, With thee at Fate repine; And every grief that swells thy heart, Is grief no less to mine. [Exit, followed by Aquil. and the Roman soldiers. SCENE II. Osrhoes, Pharnaspes. Osr. Pharnaspes, didst thou comprehend the meaning Of CÃ¦sar's words? To me they speak a passion For Emirena, jealousy of thee, And confidence in her.âShould this be true; Should she consent to love my deadliest foe, This vengeful sword before thy sightâbut no, I'll not believe itâshe is still my daughter. Phar. What says my sovereign? CÃ¦sar is too just, And she is trueâwhat doubts perplex your peace? Osr. Who doubts of ill but rarely is deceiv'd. Phar. I fly to seek herâyou shall seeâ Osr. Then goâ But tell her not that here I lurk conceal'd Among thy followers. Phar. From your daughter too Would you be hid? Osr. I would, when next we meet, Thou shalt know all my purpose. Phar. Yes, my king, With her I shall return to glad your sight. Already are my sufferings o'er, My soul exulting mourns no more; But all dissolv'd in tender sighs, Impatient to her presence flies. In vain my lips would words supply, My words in broken accents die; My panting heart, no more depress'd, Now bounds and struggles in my breast. [Exit. SCENE III. Osrhoes alone. First let me from the insulting foe redeem The precious pledge, that only makes me fear, Then give my fury wayâYes, haughty Roman! Tremble at Osrhoes' vengeance. I am conquer'd, But not depress'd; for know, to thy confusion, My soul, unchang'd, shall ever war with Adrian. A sturdy oak, which nature forms To brave a hundred winters' storms, While round its head the whirlwinds blow, Remains with root infix'd below. When fell'd to earth a ship it sails Through dashing waves and driving gales; And now at sea, again defies The threatening clouds and howling skies. [Exit. SCENE IV. An apartment destined for Emirena in the imperial palace. Aquilius alone. Unless invention frame some artifice To work on Emirena, I am lost. Yes, generous CÃ¦sar gives her to Pharnaspes. If he, a lover, can expunge a passion Which I with care fomented, he'll return To love Sabina; she, whose image ever Dwells in my heart. Ah! where is Emirena? Behold she comesâNow to my wiles. SCENE V. Enter Emirena. Emir. Aquilius. Aqu. Ah! princess, had you seen the rage of CÃ¦sar: Pharnaspes has requir'd from him your freedom; Confess'd he lov'd you, and was lov'd again; And thus has kindled in the emperor's bosom A thousand jealous pangs. He raves to madness, And vows, unless you quit your former love, He to the capitol will drag you, bound In servile fetters, at his chariot wheels. Emir. Is this the hero of your Tiber? This The boasted idol of imperial Rome? I have his word I should not be expos'd A spectacle of triumph. Is it then With you no shame for heroes to be false? Aquil. When love obscures the sense and blinds the reason, Even heroes, Emirena, change their nature, Emir. Shall Emirena then be led in triumph? O! never, neverâAsia too has those Who dare to die. Aquil. Noâbetter means there are In Emirena's power. Know, CÃ¦sar comes To offer you Pharnaspes, hoping thus To read your secret thoughts: beware, nor trust His seeming friendship: art elude with art. Receive your prince belov'd with feign'd indifference; Reject his profferr'd hand: guard every word, And dress your looks with well-dissembled coldness, As if your breast no longer own'd the lover. Emir. And what of me will poor Pharnaspes say? Alas! thou know'st not how his heart is form'd: At such unkindness I shall see him fall A victim at my feet. Aquil. Farewellâreflectâ And, if you can, embrace some better counsel. Emir. Hear me: at least prevent the princeâ Aquil. He's here. Emir. O! Heavens! Aquil. Now summon all your fortitude; I've trac'd your path to shun the threatening evil. [Exit. SCENE VI. Enter Adrian and Pharnaspes. Emir. [aside.] O! Emirena, what a cruel trial Thy love must here endure. Adr. [entering.] Say, prince, is that The beauty you adore? Phar. O! Heavens! 'tis she Whose charms are ever lovelier in my sight. Emir. [aside.] How my heart throbs! Adr. See, beauteous Emirena, With whom I am return'd; and well I know My presence never was more grateful to thee. Speak, undisguis'd. Emir. What stranger, sir, is this? Phar. What stranger! Adr. Know'st thou not those features? Emir. Heaven! [aside. I know them not. [to Adr. Adr. And hast thou, Emirena, Ne'er view'd their likeness? Emir. NoâI fear to speak; If I betray my love we both are lost. [aside. Adr. [to Phar.] Is this the maid who learn'd with thee to love? Phar. I'm all amazement! Am I then Pharnaspes? Alas! where am I? Emir. [aside.] How I sympathize With all he feels. Adr. [to Emir.] If fear, or doubt of me Restrain thee, Emirena, know that Adrian Is not a tyrant o'er another's heart. Behold thy loverâI restore him to thee; As well befits his eldership of passion. Emir. [aside.] Be constant stillâ[to Adr.] I here refuse the gift. Phar. My princess, say, what has Pharnaspes done? What crime unknown to raise thine anger thus? Dost thou distrust my truth? Emir. No moreâno moreâ Phar. Am I not heâ Emir. [to Phar.] In pity, O! forbearâ For well my state deserves it. Phar. Yet rememberâ Emir. [to Phar.] Remembrance now is lostâI cannot speakâ My adverse fate engrosses every thought: Unless thou mean'st to see me sink before theeâ Leave me in peaceâaway. Phar. Leave thee in peace? Inhuman!âyesâI will obeyâbut look, Look once upon this face, there read the heart Of himâno, cruel, do not look upon me, If thou would'st wish Pharnaspes to obey thee. If once, ingrate! thy looks I meet, I never can depart; Alas! too soon I shall forget Thy faithless changing heart. With blushes then thy face may glow, But ah! my love will claim Less anguish for the wrongs I know Than pity for thy shame. [Exit. SCENE VII. Adrian, Emirena. Adr. But whither go'st thou now? [to Emir. going. Emir. To weep alone My wretched fortuneâtears at least are free, Though all be lost. Adr. O! nothing hast thou lost: I in those beauteous eyes have lost my peace. Emir. I hop'd for more respectâa royal mind, Though stript of empire, still remains unchang'd: My crown is Fortune's gift: but from itself My heart derives its greatness. Adr. [aside.] Lovely pride! [to Emir.] And what offence has now thy virtue suffer'd From Adrian's love? From Adrian, who can give If thou consent, his hand and empire? Emir. No, They're plighted to Sabina. Adr. True; I've lov'd her These twice five years: but must our passions then Endure for ever? Surely in Sabina Such constancy resides not: different far Is Adrian's fortune since. I had not then Beheld thee, Emirena; I was then A private man in Rome, and ever near her. But now I sigh a captive in your chains, And wear the imperial laurel on my brows; Sabina distant treads the banks of Tiber, And I Orontes' shores. SCENE VIII. Enter Aquilius. Aquil. My lord. Adr. What would'st thou? Aquil. Sir, from the Latian city is arriv'dâ Adr. Say, who? Aquil. Sabina. Adr. Mighty Gods! Emir. [aside.] Blest chance For my relief. Adr. What means her progress hither Without my summons? Art thou not deceiv'd? Aquil. No, hear the tumult of the following people, Whose shouts proclaim her empress. Adr. Heavens!âAquilius, Go hence, conduct her to a different part; Let her not thus surprise me: I would ask A moment to compose my troubled looksâ Use every artificeâ Aquil. My lord, she comes. Adr. I'm all confus'd! SCENE IX. Enter Sabina, attended by matrons and Roman knights. Sab. CÃ¦sar, my lord, my husband! Behold the hour that I have wish'd so long At last is come, and I once more am near you: Permit me now to view you crown'd with laurel; With that victorious laurel, which has cost My love such frequent sighs. Adr. [aside.] What shall I say? Sab. You answer notâ Adr. I could not hope, Sabinaâ Might Iâbut thy fatigue must now require A needful restâWho waits?âConduct Sabina To some apartment that befits her rank, And honour her as me. Sab. Must I then leave you? With you I came to seek repose. Adr. Forgive me, Some weighty cares demand me hence. Sab. The time Has been, Sabina was your first of cares. Adr. 'Tis true; but empire now must claim from Adrian A sovereign's duty. [Exit. SCENE X. Sabina, Emirena, Aquilius. Sab. Say, what means Augustus? Aquilius, speak. Aquil. The secret lies not deep To searching eyes. Augustus is a lover, And yonder stands your rival. Emir. Gracious empress, So Heaven preserve you long for CÃ¦sar, hear And succour the distress'dâmy crown, my husband, My country and my father, all are lost. Sab. [aside.] The haughty fair derides me. Emir. On this hand, This royal hand permit me thusâ Sab. Away: I am not yet become the wife of CÃ¦sar, Nor art thou wretched as thy words imply; Since Fortune, leaving still thy wonted beauty, Has little taken from thee. At thy choice Thou may'st acquire even more than thou hast lost, And I perhaps from thee, some future time, May ask that grace which now thou seek'st of me. Emir. My shameful bondsâ Sab. No moreâI would be private. Emir. O! Heaven! what sorrows must this breast endure. Against a helpless maid distress'd No more such rigour show: Ah! wrong not thus your noble breast, To scorn a captive's woe. Trust not too far a prosperous state, I near the throne was born: Thou too may'st know a prisoner's fate, In servile chains to mourn. [Exit. SCENE XI. Sabina, Aquilius. Aquil. [aside.] Now let us prove our fortune. Sab. Say, Aquilius, Does not Sabina's fate excite thy pity? Aquil. Yes, I confess Augustus most unjust: He thinks not that revenge is in your power. Beauty and virtue both alike are yours, What heart so cold but these must surely warm: Before his eyes you shouldâ Sab. [haughtily.] What should Sabina? Aquil. Pursue him still with unabated passion, And make him blush at his inconstancy. [aside.] The tempest threats, let us regain the shore. [Exit. SCENE XII. Sabina alone. And do I weep? Ah! noâat least my weakness Shall be conceal'd.âBut such a cruel stroke Bears down my best resolves. To Asia's clime I came to find my love, and find him false: I find him with my rival; see him troubled At my approach. He scarcely deigns to hear me; He flies my sightâand yet I must not weep: Alas! a rock would weep at woes like mine. Ye powers! if justice mark your reign, To me his heart restore; Nor let these flowing tears in vain A loss like him deplore. You know he's mine, (ah! faithless spouse!) You heard his last farewell, When from his lips, with mingled vows, The parting accents fell. [Exit. SCENE XIII. A view of the imperial palace on fire; the flames breaking out from several parts of the building: some part in ruins. Time, night. Osrhoes comes from the palace, with a lighted torch in his right hand and a sword drawn in his left. A train of Parthians with lighted torches. Osr. Intrepid Parthians! Heaven propitious smiles Upon our bold attempt: turn yet a moment And view the ruins of yon hostile palace. Amidst our loss this shadow of revenge Is some reliefâBehold the bursting fires! What wreaths of smoke and flame ascend the sky! O! would to all the Gods, yon walls that now The Parthian rage destroys, within them held The senators, the capitol, and Rome! SCENE XIV. Enter Pharnaspes. Phar. Osrhoes, my king. Osr. Pharnaspes, lookâbehold The work of Osrhoes' hand! [pointing to the flames. Phar. Immortal powers! Where is thy daughter? Osr. Who can tell?âEven now, There, with her lover, wrapt perchance in flames, She suffers for the wrongs she heap'd on thee. Phar. [going.] O! Emirena! O! my life! Osr. Yet hear meâ What would'st thou seek? Phar. To save my love or perish. [going. Osr. O! noâforget, far rather, an ingrate That has betray'd thee. Phar. O! I know her false, But still my soul adores her. [enters amidst the flames and ruins of the palace. SCENE XV. Osrhoes, Parthians. Osr. Perish then, Unthinking youth, while we, my valiant friends, Preserve ourselves for greater deeds. Let each Cast down his torch to earth, and each again Retire to his concealment. [the Parthians go out. âYet, in spite Of all my rage I feel myself a father; I cannot quit this placeâStill, still I turn To yon devoted wallsâLet me not listen To this unmanly weakness.âAh! even now Perhaps a dying child invokes my name: O! that Pharnaspes may arrive to save her! Could I but learn their fate!âBut whither would My inconsiderate steps? O Gods! look thereâ Ha! who comes yonder? See, the tumult thickens, And all the imperial palace is in motionâ My friendâmy daughterâwhither shall I turn? I lose myself and yet preserve not them. Since, mighty Gods! you've taken all from Osrhoes, Why have you left him still these feeble passions? [Exit hastily. SCENE XVI. Emirena flying in terror, Pharnaspes enters to her in chains, guarded. Emir. Ah! whither shall I fly? Who now will save me? Could I but learnâO! Heaven! Pharnaspes! Phar. Princess! Emir. And art thou here a prisoner? Phar. Art thou safe? Emir. Death comes not to the unhappyâCould thy hand Kindle these flames? Phar. Noâbut 'tis so believ'd. Emir. Believ'd, and why? Phar. Because I am a Parthian, Because I'm lost, abandon'd to despair, Because amidst these walls I was surpris'd. Emir. Say, to what purpose came Pharnaspes hither? Phar. To save thee and to die. Emir. And hadst thou died Think'st thou that Emirena would be sav'd? Phar. Why dost thou mock me thus? This feign'd compassion Exceeds thy cruelty. Emir. My feign'd compassion! Phar. How can I think it true? Far other, princess, Thy words but late imported. Emir. Words, alas! Might differâEmirena was the same. Phar. What meant thy cold reception? Emir. Fear to raise The jealousy of Adrian. Phar. What from him Could Emirena fear? Emir. That shame which waits The vanquish'd at a haughty Roman's triumph? Phar. Did he not nobly offer thee this hand? Emir. All artifice to read my secret thoughts. Phar. Then am I stillâ Emir. My only hope, my life. Phar. And art thou thenâ Emir. Still faithful to Pharnaspes; And to the tomb will still remain unchang'd, And after death, if then the dead retain Of aught in life remembrance, shall thy image Dwell in my constant soul. Phar. No more, my love, Enough; I here detest my jealous doubts. Forgive me, Emirena! Cruel stars! In your despite Pharnaspes shall defy The rage of tyrants and the pangs of suffering. My princess loves meâyes, her lips confirm it; And midst your frowns I shall be happy still. Emir. Ah! go not yet. Phar. Alas! necessity Now tears me from thee. Emir. Gracious powers! Pharnaspes, What fate awaits us next? Phar. My soul is fearless, And death itself has only terrors for me, As I'm forbid, alas! to die beside thee. If I'm denied with thee to die, Thou soul of my desires! Thy name shall mingle with the sigh That on my lip expires. Farewell, dear partner of my breast, Weep not my fate to view: Ah! think Pharnaspes still is blest If Emirena's true. [Exit guarded. SCENE XVII. Emirena alone. If it be true, that from another's grief We find our own reliev'd, contemplate me, Ye wretched sufferers, and regain your peace, In finding all your woes surpass'd by mine. In vain I weep my hapless state, As mourns the widow'd dove, Who, seeking, finds her captive mate Divided from her love. Still hovering near his cage she flies, Where prisoner he remains: Like her I go, with sorrowing eyes, To see my prince in chains. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A gallery in the apartments of Adrian. Emirena, Aquilius. Aquil. Who sooner than yourself can save Pharnaspes? 'Tis yours, at will, to rule the heart of CÃ¦sar; And every female but yourself would better Employ a monarch's love. Emir. Of what avail To me, who love not CÃ¦sar, is the power? Aquil. And must he be belov'd to make him think That he is so? Emir. Shall I proclaim a lie? Aquil. O! noâa lie is now an artifice Held gross and insecure: true policy Is so to work, that whom we would deceive Should prove his own deceiver: let a sigh, Half check'd with art, escape you; or a word Of doubtful meaning; or a glance, that seems As taken by surprise; a winning smile: The smallest action: silence or a blush: Nay, what you do not speak; all, all alike Shall spread the snare; for lovers still are prone To sooth their wishes. He will think you love him, And yet yourself may still retain the power, To say your lips had ne'er confess'd a passion. Emir. I know not where such art is to be found. Aquil. Woman has not to seek it: with her birth It grew and flourish'd. From the languid eye To drop the obedient tear; to dress the lip In smiles that hold no commerce with the heart: To chace, at will, the colour from the cheek: To flush the changing features: these are all The sex's privilege, on you bestow'd, Heaven's voluntary gift: to man they cost Labour and deep design. Emir. Thou, that art grown Old in a court, canst ne'er have cause to envy Talents like these. I deem thou art not found Among the few, tenacious of the ties Of ancient honour. When the time demands, Thou know'st full well with open looks to allure An unsuspecting foe; to place before him The precipice, and then lament his fall: To offer all thy service, but to serve Thyself alone: to clothe an accusation With treacherous praise, and aggravate a fault In seeming to defend it: from the throne To keep the good at distance; make the sovereign Hated for punishments, and to thyself Usurp the merit of rewards: beneath Apparent zeal to hide an impious purpose, And build thy fortune on another's ruin. Aquil. Thou, Emirena, wouldst revenge thy sex: I thought not thus to touch thee, nor complain Of what thou say'st: nay more, to be sincere, It seems to me we both have spoken truth. I meant but to advise. Emir. I ask'd for aid, And not advice. Aquil. Aquilius ever thought, That wholesome counsel gave no little aid. Believe me, princessâbut farewell, I hear Some one approachâ'tis Adrian sure at hand. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter Sabina. Sab. [entering.] O! Heavens! my rival here! Emir. Ye powers! Sabina! Sab. Thou art, indeed, most loyal in thy care, Beyond my utmost thought: the conflagration Is scarce extinguish'd, when we find thee here In thy lov'd CÃ¦sar's palace. Emir. Ah! Sabina, How great is your injustice! CÃ¦sar's love Is not my crime, but punishment. The danger Of poor Pharnaspes weighs upon my soul. Behold the cause that brings me to these walls: Can I, in silence, see him perish thus? Pharnaspes is myself! to him I gave My virgin heart, and time has travell'd long Since first our loves began. Sab. Speak'st thou sincere, Or dost thou feign? Emir. O! I should feign indeed, If thus I did not speak. Sab. Yet see'st thou not That pleading in his cause but angers CÃ¦sar? Emir. I have no other way. Sab. Wouldst thou attend, A better might be found. With thy Pharnaspes, Fly from the palace. Lentulus, the leader, Keeps him in charge: he to my parents owes Whate'er he has; and from his grateful heart I well may rest assur'd of stronger proofs Than this which now I seek. Emir. O! might, indeed, Your thoughts succeed. Sab. Go then; prepare securely For thy departure: to the greater fountain In CÃ¦sar's gardens, I'll conduct thy spouse. Expect me there before the sun attains His mid-day height. Emir. Ah! princess, may I hopeâ I am so us'd to bear the frowns of fate. Sab. Behold my hand; receive this certain pledge. Emir. My breast can scarce contain the mighty joy! O! generous princess! happy Emirena! By thee shall wreaths eternal grow, To deck the Roman victor's brow, And all the adoring world shall bow To Heaven's sublimest gift in thee. While this imperial hand, that deigns To ease a lover's anxious pains, O'er subject realms the rule maintains, And gives to kings their liberty. [Exit. SCENE III. Sabina alone. When Emirena shall be hence remov'd, Perchance my lover may again return To all his former kindness. Every fire, When fuel fails, must perish; and the stream, Divided from the source that feeds it, dries. SCENE IV. Enter Adrian. Adr. [entering.] My life! my Emirena! [sees her.] Heavenly Powers! What have I said? [going. Sab. Why do you fly me, Adrian? Ah! grudge me not your presence one short moment; Then, if you will, return to her you love. Adr. What says Sabina? Does she then believeâ And who should Adrian love? Sab. Ah! hide not from me That candid blush of shame; you know not, Adrian, To me how grateful: conscience never dyes The cheek of him who feels not he is guilty; And he who feels his guilt will soon disclaim it. Adr. O! Heaven! Sab. You sighâgive me that sigh, my lord. Immortal powers! Who once would have believ'd A change like this? The glory of our Rome, The hero's pattern, and my only hope, Adrian inconstant! Is it possible? It cannot beâWho has seduc'd your faith? Give me to know it all. Adr. What shall I say? How is my soul confus'd!âAh! cease so gently To chide my falsehood; call me base, betrayer; Give, give thine anger vent. I own, Sabina, Thou justly may'st reproach me: thy deserts, Our mutual interchange of love; the vows A thousand times repeated, all now rise To my remembrance; but in vain, Sabina, I'm not myself. I know, I prize, thy virtues, Thy every charmâand yetâa single lookâ I hate myself; I loath my own injustice. Thy wrongs cry out for vengeance.âDost thou wish The death of Adrian? Take, O! take his life; 'Tis just, nor will I murmur.âWould'st thou tear The sacred laurel from Augustus' brow, He gives it to thy hand: the happy world With joy will bend beneath thy virtuous sway. Sab. I ask your heart and not your empire, Adrian. Adr. This heart was thine, and, witness Heaven! I strove To keep it all thy own. The Gods, Sabina, Beheld my secret thoughts: all Asia's beauties To me were nothing: long, ah! long I deem'd The loveliest glances cold compar'd to thine. Sab. And yetâ Adr. And yetâI know not how, secure In conscious virtue I forgot defence, And love surpris'd me. Flush'd with victory, My passions warm'd with all the warrior's ardour Was Emirena first conducted to me. The soul in tumult oft imbibes with ease A new affection. I beheld her chain'd Implore my pity, felt her press my hand, And bathe it with her tears, while on my face She fix'd her suppliant eye with such a lookâ âAh! had Sabina seen her then, the sight Had urg'd even her to pardon Adrian's weakness. Sab. It is too muchâNot only to forsake me, But dare avow it; to my face extol The charms of her, my rival for thy heart! And dost thou further hope Sabina, mov'd To hear thy suffering, should excuse thy guilt? Unheard-of tyranny! Have I deserv'd A recompense like this? Barbarian! traitor! Ungrateful Adrian! [sinks on a seat and weeps. SCENE V. Enter Aquilius behind. Aquil. [apart.] Ha! Sabina here! Adr. [aside.] Her tears have touch'd my soul. [to her.] Ah! fair Sabina, Take comfort, Adrian will again return To wear thy happy chains; again be thine. Aquil. [apart.] Malicious stars! Sab. [tenderly.] Indeed! Adr. I yield to pity; Pity, the gentle harbinger of love. Sab. Scarce can I yet believeâ Aquil. [apart.] Now, policy Once more assist me. Sab. Should'st thou yet again See Emirena? Adr. Never, never more Will I behold her. Sab. Canst thou, Adrian, trust Thy bosom's firmness? Adr. 'Tis resolv'd; and all The will determines, soon the deed confirms. Aquil. [coming forward.] The lovely captive princess has requested To kneel before your feet: long has she sought, But sought you, sir, in vain. Sab. [aside.] Now comes the trial. Adr. Aquilius, no; I must no more behold her: At length 'tis time remembrance should recall My faithful, kind Sabina. Sab. [aside.] Joyful sounds! Aquil. 'Tis surely just; but little is the boon Poor Emirena asks. Will you deny To her alone what all obtain? 'Tis true She is a captive, but was born a queen. Adr. 'Tis fairly spoken. Surely, my Sabina, 'Twere cruel not to hear her. Sab. [aside.] O! my heart! Adr. I'll hear her in thy presence: where is then Thy fear? Yet stay and thou shalt seeâ Sab. [rising.] O! no, Thou hast enough deceiv'd my easy faith. Enough for me my love sincere, Ingrate! is thus repaid; But think not still I'll linger here To see myself betray'd. I know thy best resolves are weak Thy passion to control: Thine eyes, that still their object seek, Thy sighs and restless actions speak The feelings of thy soul. [Exit. SCENE VI. Adrian, Aquilius. Aquil. I fly to bring fair Emirena. [going. Adr. No, Forbear awhile. Aquil. Can you to her refuse This justice, CÃ¦sar? Adr. I refuse her not. But at this momentâDidst thou hear Sabina? Love goads me on, while reason checks the rein. I would! but O! ye powers, what pain to thinkâ Aquil. Speak, speak, my lord; unless I know your grief How shall I give you comfort? Adr. Speak? alas! Myself I know not what my thoughts intend. [Exit. SCENE VII. Aquilius alone. Be firm, my heart: though victory be near As yet 'tis not mature. The love of CÃ¦sar, The anger of Sabina, both alike War on my side: the battle is at hand, But let us not too rashly risk the field. Of old the experienc'd warrior tried To watch each motion of the foe; Restrain'd his warmth, each vantage spy'd, And cautious dealt the skilful blow. With hand and foot alike he feign'd, By turns to advance, by turns to yield; Till one propitious moment gain'd The envied laurels of the field. [Exit. SCENE VIII. The gardens belonging to the palace. Emirena alone. Ah! why, my love, this long delay? Each moment seems a tedious day. SCENE IX. Enter Sabina with Pharnaspes. Sab. [to Phar.] Behold your spouse. Phar. My lovely Emirena. Emir. Art thou indeed my prince? I scarce believe The bliss sincere. Phar. At length, my dearest princessâ Sab. The time admits not now such fond exchange Of mutual transports: think of speedy safety. This unfrequented passage, veil'd in gloom, Is open for your flight, by Lentulus Reveal'd to me: not distant from the entrance It branches in two straiter paths: the right Leads to the river, and the left the palace. Avoid the second. Go, my friends, secure; May Fortune guide and Love protect your steps. Emir. O! generous empress! Phar. Most exalted fair-one! What gratitude from usâ Sab. I ask but little: Ah! think of me sometimes, and if amidst Your happiness you recollect Sabina, Afford one pitying sigh to my misfortunes. Ye gentle pair, from realms above Shine every star to bless your love, Nor give your life, like mine, to prove Misfortune's cruel frown. I envy not your sorrows rest, But hope to find, with grief oppress'd, That pity in some feeling breast Which mine to you has shown. [Exit. SCENE X. Pharnaspes, Emirena. Phar. And art thou mine? Alas! I fear, and still Some vision seems to mock me. Emir. Let us fly, Unless we mean to find our bliss a vision. [they go towards the passage. Phar. Stay, Emirenaâ [stopping her. Emir. Wherefore? Phar. Hear'st thou not The clash of arms? Emir. I heard indeed the sound; But whence it came I know not. Phar. From the path Where lies our destin'd way. Emir. Alas!â Phar. My love, Be not dismay'dâconceal thyself, while I Explore the cause of this ill-tim'd alarm. Emir. What can this mean?âKind stars, betray me not. [conceals herself. SCENE XI. Enter Osrhoes in a Roman habit, his sword drawn and bloody, from the passage pointed out by Sabina. Osr. [entering.] Now let the tyrant to the infernal shades Relate the trophies of his boasted Rome. Phar. And whither goes my sovereign thus disguis'd With Roman vest and Roman arms? Osr. My friend, We are reveng'dâthe universe is freed From its oppressorâLo! the happy sword That boasts of Adrian's death. Phar. What says my king? Osr. Know, prince, that oft our hated foe was wont To tread this secret path, which late to me One of his train disclos'd. The power of gold Could find a traitor even in Tiber's heroes. Thus dress'd I lurk'd in ambush, till Augustus Drew near with one attendant, when this hand Dispatch'd the tyrant. Phar. But deceiv'd in darkness, Might not your erring hand have miss'd the foe And slain his follower? Osr. This was well foreseen. As he drew near, his treacherous servant feign'd To fall as if by chance: this wile expos'd The life of CÃ¦sar and secur'd his own. Emir. [looking out.] What is that Roman? In his hand a weapon Seems stain'd with bloodâCould I but view at least His features now conceal'dâ Phar. What course remains? Should we pursue the path you trod but now We may encounter numbers, whom the rumour Has gather'd hither. Every way beside Is watch'd by guards and menials. Osr. Let our swords Then hew a passage through them. Phar. Noâreserve Such desperate hazard for the extreme of danger: First let me prove what means may yet be found For safer flight. Emir. [listening.] My ears attempt in vain To catch their cautious whispers. Phar. Midst these shades Awhile remain conceal'd: with instant speed I will return. Osr. Delay not; if thou dost Osrhoes will hence and tempt his fate alone. [conceals himself in the grove. Phar. This path will lead meânoâI am deceiv'dâ 'Tis surely hereâWhat if I take the way Prescrib'd us by Sabina? CÃ¦sar's fate Perchance is yet unknown, and ere the alarm Is spread, or guards arrive, we may escapeâ âIt shall be so. [going he meets Adrian. SCENE XII. Enter Adrian with a drawn sword and guards. Adr. [meeting Phar.] Stay, traitor. Phar. Mighty Gods! What do I see! Adr. Ho! guards, stop every pass That favours flight. Phar. I am motionless with wonder. Emir. [advancing to listen.] Alas! we are discover'd. Adr. Dost thou gaze To see me yet alive? Ungrateful man! Who hop'd but now to pierce the breast of Adrian. Thy barbarous insults, when the stroke was given Reveal'd thy impious purpose. Emir. [listening.] Yes, the error Is now apparent; he who lurks conceal'd, He is the traitor. Adr. Dost thou answer nothing? Perfidious! wherefore cam'st thou? What design Urg'd thee to this? Who loos'd thy fetters? Speak. Phar. I cannot speak. Adr. Not speak!âLet him be dragg'd By force to prisonâhence. Emir. [discovering herself.] Hold! hold! and hear meâ O! he is innocent. Phar. Alas! Emir. Look there: That grove conceals the traitor. [goes towards Osrhoes. Phar. Heavens! forbear. [to Emir. Emir. Behold him, CÃ¦sar. [pointing to Osrhoes, who comes forward. Osr. Yesâbehold in me The man you seek. Emir. [motionless.] My father! Adr. Parthia's king Cloth'd in a Roman garb! Are all alike In treason leagu'd against me? Osr. I alone Thirst for thy blood: 'tis true my sword has err'd, But, if thou giv'st me life, this hand shall yet Retrieve its first mistake. Adr. To assault me thus With treacherous rage in darkness? Then to seize The moment when I fell. Osr. Malicious fortune! 'Twas this deceiv'd me. Thy attendant's art Had plann'd a fall with purpose to betray thee; But by thy casual fall I miss'd the signal, And slaughter'd him for thee. Adr. Is this, barbarian, Is this my recompense? Depress'd and vanquish'd I bade thee welcome to imperial Rome, And offer'd thee her friendshipâ Osr. Impious Romans! Such is your name indeed for tyranny: Your friends are slaves, and over these you reign. Adr. We are but faithful guardians of the laws: Who seek to league with us are not subjected To us, but justice; though with you I know Justice is tyranny. Osr. And who, proud Romans, Made you her guardians and interpreters? Do you partake with Gods their heavenly councils? Or are you Gods yourselves? Adr. Though far, O! far From us the name of Gods, at least their virtues We seek to imitate; and he, whose mind Is fram'd like theirs, to others is a God. Osr. Are these your marks of deity, to thirst For plunder'd wealth? To desolate a kingdom? To give a loose to lawless love? To oppress A guiltless rival? To betray a womanâ Adr. Thou dost too much abuse my clemency. Ho! guards, to separate dungeons bear these traitors To await their punishment. Phar. And Emirena? Adr. The ingrate shall suffer. Phar. O! unjust and cruel! What crime in her can merit CÃ¦sar's vengeance? Adr. You know on each my wrath should fall, Since all are foes, with insults all Against my peace combine. Here jealous Rage and stern Disdain, Remorse and Love unfeeling reign, Here all their torments join. [points to his breast. The Furies on the dreary shore, Where black Cocytus' waters roar, Can add no pangs to mine. [Exit. SCENE XIII. Osrhoes, Pharnaspes, Emirena, guards. Emir. My father! shall I dare to call thee father? Have I not murder'd thee?âIf yet thy loveâ Osr. Away,ânor shake my constancy. Emir. Alas! Well may'st thou drive me from theeâO! forgive Your EmirenaâSee me here, my father, Low at your feet. Osr. Leave, leave me, O! my daughter; I've no resentment kindled against thee: In this embrace receive my love and pardon. Farewell the dearest part of Osrhoes' being! Emir. O! fatal, last adieu! Phar. O! cruel parting! Emir. That kind embrace, that tender sigh, That pardon given, that speaking eye, But add to all my former pain, And deeper dye the guilty stain! What I have prov'd, what thou hast been My conscious heart with anguish keen Too late laments, and heavier mourns The crime that thus thy love returns. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Osrhoes, Pharnaspes. Phar. O! would to Heaven my blood could yet suffice To free my king and save my Emirena! Osr. Enough, my friend, I was before unmann'd, Why wilt thou too conspire against my virtue? No; let the foe, to his confusion, see me Superior to his threats; behold me fall Unconquer'd still, and dread me even in death. The lion, late resistless found, That sinks beneath a mortal wound, And sees his blood distain the ground, Will unsubdu'd appear. Not death his fierceness can assuage; The hunter, that could once engage The lordly beast, his dying rage Now strikes with panic fear. [Exit. SCENE XV. Pharnaspes alone. How is my soul still bound with mortal ties To this unhappy frame! thus, thus to bear Such load of wretchedness! Unpitying stars! O! take me hence and let me rest for ever. 'Tis false that mortals' vital breath With sorrow must decay; That every ill, which brings not death, Will lightly pass away. No thought that sooths man's suffering kind To me can comfort give: My woes would shake the firmest mind, And yet, alas! I live. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A hall with seats. Sabina, Aquilius. Sab. Must I depart, and is he then so blind, So lost to justice? Say, what guilt is mine That Adrian seeks to punish? Aquil. Adrian found That you were privy to, and first advis'd The flight of Emirena and Pharnaspes. He thinks his guard seduc'd by you; and knows So well to aggravate your fault, that all Who hear the sentence praise his clemency. Sab. I thought but to secure for me his heart By studying only to advance his glory, And make a rival happy; not impell'd By hate or anger, but by love and pity. In this I could not err, or if I err'd, Such error sure was venial. Aquil. Yes, Sabina, I know it well; and CÃ¦sar too perhaps Knows it not less; but gladly thus admits A fair pretence. Sab. 'Tis well; then let him see me, And blush at his own sentence. Aquil. 'Tis his charge That I forbid you now to appear before him. Sab. O Heaven! but must I then depart unheard? Aquil. It must be so. Sab. And when? Aquil. The ships are now Prepar'd for your reception. Sab. Such command It ill befits Sabina to obey. Aquil. Ah! yet submit, or you are lostâdepart. Trust to my faithful care. You shall subdue By yielding to him. I will watch the moment, And urge him to recall you. Sab. Yet, at least Tell him, Aquiliusâ Aquil. Go: there needs no more; I understand whate'er your lips would utter. Sab. Tell him he's faithless and unjust, He breaks with me a lover's trustâ Yet, ah! refrain, and rather say That parting I his will obey, And say how much I love. Should you perceive a stifled sigh, Or tear just starting from his eye, Ah! bid him for a moment turn; And ere I seek the silent urn, His pity let me prove. [Exit. SCENE II. Aquilius alone. I first have plann'd to send Sabina hence, And fondly then repine at her departure. Think better, O! my heart, residing here To thee she's lost; her presence in Augustus Revives his dying virtue. Ill, Aquilius, Thou bear'st thy lov'd-one's absence; but remember Short sufferance now ensures thee years of bliss. The shooting vine more fertile springs Beneath the planter's knife; Her ripen'd clusters larger brings, And blooms with fresher life. In warm Arabia's climate found The odorous balsam trills; But from the bark's inflicted wound Alone the juice distills. SCENE III. Enter Adrian. Adr. What hast thou gain'd, Aquilius? Aquil. Nothing gain'd: Sabina, sir, is constant to depart. Adr. She has indeed too just a cause for anger. Aquil. But yet so gentle her complaints, it seems As if some other must have touch'd her heart; And much I doubt she makes a specious plea Of your inconstancy to veil her own. Adr. I like it not: this temper in a woman Excites suspicion. Let us seek Sabina. Aquil. My lord, you have forgot the Parthian king. My counsel you approv'd, and meant to appease him: I've sent for Osrhoes, and he waits your summons. When all is ready to complete your purpose You still remain confus'd and unresolv'd. Adr. Alas! thou know'st not what a war of thought Now agitates my bosom. Rome, the senate, Sabina, Emirena, love and glory, All, all are present to me, while in vain I seek to reconcile my jarring passions. On every side I fear some threatening rock: I choose, repent, and long perplex'd in doubt, I know not good from ill, till driven at last To sudden choice, I choose from all, the worst. Aquil. Ah! cease, my sovereign, to torment yourself: You have within your arms the fair for whom You sigh, and fear to clasp her to your bosom. I cannot bear your griefs: permit me, sir, To introduce the king. Adr. Yet stayâif stillâ Aquil. No more of doubts, my lord. Adr. Act as thou wilt. [Exit Aquilius. SCENE IV. Adrian alone. What will the world then say? To cherish life Is nature's law; and thus oppress'd with anguish, I cannot live depriv'd of Emirena. SCENE V. Enter Osrhoes and Aquilius. Osr. Why am I summon'd here? Adr. Let Parthia's king Be seated and attend; and though his anger Rejects the peace, he may vouchsafe a truce. [sits. Osr. My nature cannot brook a long forbearance. [sits. Aquil. Aquilius, now thy fate determines. [aside. Adr. Osrhoes, All things on earth must change, and shall we find Our enmity alone endure for ever? Peace is become as useful to the victor As needful to the vanquish'd: food for strife Is wanting now between us: adverse fate So much from thee has taken: bounteous Heaven Has given so much to Adrian, that no more Is left for thee to lose, or me to conquer. Osr. O! yesâmy hatred yet remains unshaken; That still is mine, and shall suffice for Osrhoes. Aquil. Barbarian! savage! [aside. Adr. Boast not that as good, Which, when possess'd, torments its own possessor: Thou hast a better way to sooth thy pride. Know, thou art the arbiter of my repose, As Adrian of thy life. So Heaven directs The events of human kind, that each to each By turns is needful; and the happiest man, From him that is most wretched, often finds Something to hope or fear. Speak thou the word, And Emirena's mine: if I but will it, Osrhoes is free, and once again a king. Let us, my friend, make use of either's power To both our good. I ask from thee in gift Thy daughter's hand, and offer thee a throne. Aquil. [aside.] I tremble for his answer. Adr. Speak: what say'st thou? Thou smil'st, but dost not speak. Osr. And shall I think Adrian so weak? Adr. Alas! too surely, Osrhoes. What boots it to dissemble? If I see not Fair Emirena knit with me in marriage, Nor peace, nor happiness, nor life is mine. Osr. Since then so little serves to make thee happy, I am contentâGo, call my daughter hither. Adr. Thou dost accept my offer? Osr. Who would e'er Refuse such offer? Adr. Thou hast given me back My lost repose. Aquilius, see the princess Conducted hither. Aquil. CÃ¦sar, I obey. [aside.] Sabina is my own. [Exit. SCENE VI. Adrian, Osrhoes. Adr. I now begin To live once more. Guards, from the Parthian king Take off his chains. [guards enter. Osr. Yet stayâI will not, Adrian, Enjoy thy gifts ere thou hast tasted mine. Adr. Vain scruple! Execute my will. Osr. Forbear: Depart my friends. [guards go out. Adr. Fain would I see thee eas'd Of that injurious load. Osr. I am so happy Contemplating the future, that my limbs Feel not their shackles. Adr. Yet the princess comes not. [looking out. Osr. No less is my impatience than thy own. Adr. I go to hasten her. Osr. Behold, she's here. SCENE VII. Enter Emirena. Adr. Most lovely Emirenaâ [meeting her. Osr. Better first It fits for me to unfold our purpose to her. Adr. 'Tis true. Emir. [aside.] What mean their looks and glad deportment? Osr. Amidst our sufferings, still, my dearest daughter, We may rejoice. Would'st thou believe it? Yes, I, in thy beauty, find a recompense For all my losses past. Emir. What means my father? Adr. [to Emir.] The flame sincereâ Osr. First, Adrian, let me speak. Adr. Even as thou wilt. Osr. [to Emir.] Such virtue in thine eyes Indulgent Heaven has lavish'd, that our victor Becomes our slave: he sighs for thee, and offers All for thy sake; forgets our enmity, And stoops to be a suppliant: he abhors His life without thee, and in thee adores His tutelary goddess. Adr. [to Emir.] Yours the powerâ Osr. [to him.] I have not finish'd yet. Adr. [aside.] He tortures me With this delay. Osr. [to Emir.] Now, hear a father's voice, And in the deep recesses of thy heart Engrave his last command: let me at least In dying leave thee my avengerâhate The tyrant with a hatred great as mine, Which unextinguish'd here for ever flames, And this be thy inheritance. Adr. Ha! Osrhoes! Osr. Let neither fear nor hope unite thee to him; View him henceforth in every pang of suffering, With frenzy burn and rage with hopeless love. Adr. Just Gods! insulted thus! Osr. Now, CÃ¦sar, speak: Osrhoes has finish'd. Adr. Rash, unhappy man! Dost thou not know thou call'st the thunder down That soon may crush thee? Osr. Rave, thou haughty tyrant, Thy anguish is my triumph. Adr. Gods! what fury! Can man resemble thus the savage kind? I gaze, and all my anger's lost in wonder. Barbarian! whether rage may burn, Or madness seize thy brain, With horror from that face I turn, Where all the furies reign. The wounded boar, the trodden snake, The lion in the wild; The tigress, when her young they take, Compar'd with thee are mild. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Osrhoes, Emirena. Osr. My daughter, if thou lov'st me, lo! the time To give it proof: assist thy wretched father, Who begs compassion from thee. Emir. If my blood Can give you peace, 'tis yoursâit flows for you. Osr. O! snatch me from the Roman tyrant's power; âBut, ha! I see thee free from chains. Emir. Augustus, Who found us innocent of all attempts Against his life, to me and to Pharnaspes Gave instant freedom. But what aid for you Can I bestow? Osr. A sword! a dagger! poison! Death, death in any shape. Emir. What says my father? Must these be proofs of love? A daughter's hand Supply the cruel means! The thought alone Chills me with horror!â'Tis in vain you ask itâ My heart abhors the task, and though my heart Inhuman should consent, my conscious hand Would tremble and refuse its dreadful office. Osr. Away. I deem'd thee worthier of thy race. And dost thou startle at the name of death? Infirm of purpose! know that Osrhoes' daughter Should learn to view it with a steadier eye. A noble soul no tumult knows, When life draws near its fated close: The trembling coward only knows The fear that gives to death its pain. 'Tis false to name the dying hour, The worst of ills mankind deplore: Which bids the afflicted soul no more The galling load of life sustain. [Exit. SCENE IX. Enter Pharnaspes. Emir. Unhappy Emirena! O! for counsel In this extreme of woe! Phar. [entering.] Haste, Emirena. Emir. Haste, whither? Phar. To Augustus. Emir. To Augustus? Phar. Implore him to reverse his late decree Against thy father. Emir. What decree, Pharnaspes? Phar. He wills that, laden with the weight of chains, Osrhoes be ledâ Emir. To death? Phar. No; worse than death. Emir. Whither? Phar. To Rome. Emir. And what can I to assist him? Phar. Goâweepâentreatâto Adrian offer now Thy hand in marriageâO! forget all ties, All thoughts of love and hopeâO! give up all To save the king. Emir. He charg'd me but even now To bear for CÃ¦sar everlasting hatred. Phar. Alas! you must not think to obey commands In anger given; a momentary madness. No, 'tis our duty, dearest Emirena, Spite of himself to save him. Emir. Shall I then Resign this person to another's arms? Is this indeed thy counsel? Can Pharnaspes So steel his constancy? Phar. Alas! my princess, Thou little read'st my heart: thou little know'st What pangs this conflict costs me. While I speak I feel each fibre in my bosom tremble: Each drop of blood runs curdling through my veins. I know in thee I lose my only good, Whate'er can solace life: I know without thee I drag a wretched and despairing being; A burthen hateful to myself and others. But what must Asia say should Osrhoes fall, When we have power to save him? Let us then To this great duty sacrifice our peace. Go, go, my love, and consort of Augustus, Enjoy the highest rank of earthly greatness. To me at least one comfort will remain Amidst my wretchedness, to say, that she Who rul'd Pharnaspes' heart, now rules the world. Emir. If thou would'st have me e'er consent to lose thee Make not thyself so worthy of my love. Phar. No, Emirena, no, thou shalt not lose me, While life informs this breast I'll still be thine, Thine, as my virtue and thy fame permit. I swear by all the Gods; by those dear eyes, Those eyes that cheer my soul; and thouâbut whither Does passion thus transport me? Time admits not Of mutual sorrow; while we meditate To save him, Osrhoes may, alas! be lost. Emir. Farewell. [going. Phar. Yet hear me. Emir. What would now Pharnaspes? Phar. Go thenâyet pause awhileâAlmighty Gods! I wish thee hence, yet fain would keep thee still. Emir. O! Heaven! in leaving thee I love I feel my powers decay; Less cruel sure the stroke will prove That takes my life away. Our fortune (thus asunder torn) How ill didst thou foresee; That I, my love, for thee was born, And thou wert born for me. [Exit. SCENE X. Pharnaspes alone. The subject's loyalty, the lover's truth Maintain a doubtful conflict in my breast; By turns are victors and by turns subdued. But while with various fortune each contends, And neither triumphs, I myself am lost. The sorrows that my soul depress To cruel stars I owe; Yet, midst my sorrows, hear me bless The cause of all my woe. Light are those ills that meet mankind Without the sufferer's blame, And leave no motives in the mind For penitence or shame. [Exit. SCENE XI. A magnificent apartment of the imperial palace. Steps descending to the banks of the river Orontes. Sabina, attended by matrons and Roman knights. Aquilius. Sab. Hold, insolent, no moreâthough Adrian drives Sabina from his sight, 'tis criminal In thee to aspire to such a heart as mine. Aquil. Ne'er till this hourâ Sab. And be this hour the last To insult me with thy love. [going to embark. SCENE XII. Enter Adrian. Adr. Sabina, hear me. Aquil. [aside.] O! cruel fortune! Sab. [returning.] Ha! what would Augustus? Adr. And am I then so hateful to Sabina That she would leave me thus? Depart unseen? Sab. O! mock me not again: you send me hence; Forbid me ever more to appear before you. Adr. I send thee hence? Ah! when?âAquilius, speak: Did not Sabina ask to leave me? Sab. Heavens! [to Aquil.] And was it not the mandate of Augustus, That I should part from him, and part unseen? Aquil. [aside.] Silence or speech must both alike betray me. Sab. [to Aquil.] Perfidious man! Adr. [to Aquil.] Thou dost not answer. Sab. [to Aquil.] Now I understand thy plots, and Adrian too Shall knowâ Aquil. [to Adr.] CÃ¦sar, 'tis true, I love Sabina, And fear'd her presence might awake thy virtue, Hence far remov'd I hop'dâ Adr. Enough, thou traitor! Base, undermining slave, thou CÃ¦sar's rival! Ho! guards, secure him. [he is disarmed. Aquil. [aside.] Unpropitious fate! Adr. No longer think, my spouse, of thy departure. Sab. Thy spouse, Augustus? Adr. Yes, I find my soul Recovering now apace her wonted calm: My duty, and the scorn of Emirena; Her father's hatredâ SCENE LAST. Enter Emirena and Pharnaspes. Emir. Pardon, CÃ¦sar, pardon. Phar. O! pardon, sir. Emir. Restore to me a father. Phar. Preserve for me a king. Emir. Restore him to me; And, if thou wilt, behold me then thy own. Adr. What do I hear? Phar. Augustus, yes, to thee I here resign my empire o'er her heart. Adr. What says Pharnaspes? Emir. Yes, thou shalt be, CÃ¦sar, My guardian God: by that celestial ray Majestic beaming from thy sacred brow; By that victorious laurel, earn'd with toil; By this unconquer'd hand, the world's support; Which by this kissâ [kneels. Adr. Ah! riseâno moreâSo weeps A nymph or Goddess when she melts the heart. [aside. Sab. [aside.] Alas! what conflict now in yonder breast Of love and honour. Adr. [aside.] If I yield to justice, I lose my Emirena; if to love, I kill my best SabinaâO! my heart! How cruel is thy trial! Sab. [aside.] Though unfaithful, He yet excites my pity. Emir. CÃ¦sar, say: Art thou not yet resolv'd? Sab. [to Adr.] Augustus, hear; At lengthâ Adr. In pity torture me no further; I know what thou would'st say, alas! Sabina, I know it all. Sab. Thou little know'st Sabina: Then hearâSo fatal are our mutual wounds, That one of us must fall. Sabina dies In losing thee, and, Adrian, thou must die In losing Emirena. Heaven forbid, That to preserve a woman's worthless days, A hero thus should perish. Live, my Adrian, Live for thy fame, thy country, and the world; If not for me: I freely here release thee From every tye; forgive thee all my wrongs, And with these lips will ever plead thy cause. Adr. Is't possible! Sab. CÃ¦sar, farewell. [going. Adr. O! stay: O! noble mind! exalted dame! whose merits Might claim a thousand empires. Must you all Bring on my cheek the glow of conscious shame? [to Phar.] The loyal subject yields to me his mistress In ransom for his king: [to Emir.] The pious daughter Does, for her father, sacrifice herself. [to Sab.] And thou, forsaken, injur'd as thou art, Transcendent fair! think'st only of my peace! And I, shall I alone, with such examples, Be feeble as a girl, nor hide this face From every living eye; yet press the throne, And give to earth its laws? O! noâlet all Be happy. To the Parthian king I give His crown and liberty; to thee, Pharnaspes, Resign fair Emirena: I absolve Aquilius of his guilt; to thee, Sabina, More worthy of thy love, myself restore. Phar. Joy unexpected! Sab. This indeed is Adrian; Now he appears himself. Emir. O! whilst I breathe, This breast, Augustus, grateful for thy goodnessâ Adr. If thou wilt shew thy gratitude to CÃ¦sar, Leave, leave his heart in peace; scarce now in safety When thou art near him. Let me then entreat thee To quit me, Emirena. See thy spouse Securely thine: thy father shalt thou find In freedom to thy wish. Live and be happy, And all in deep oblivion drown the memory Of Adrian's errors. Emir. Yet, permit me, CÃ¦sarâ [attempts to kiss his hand. Adr. O! Emirenaâ'tis enoughâfarewell. [preventing her. Chorus. Augustus, while thy sacred praise Ascends the starry way, Our hands a snow-white stone shall raise To mark this blissful day. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
