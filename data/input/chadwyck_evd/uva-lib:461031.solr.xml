      <field name="fulltext">ROSAMOND. A PLAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Maze at Woodstock. Rosamond, Constance. Constance. Take not such thought of it. Ros. Nay, I take none; They cannot put me out of love so much As to take thought for them; yet I am hurt And my sense wrung at this a little. See, If six leaves make a rose, I stay red yet And the wind nothing ruins me; who says I am at waste?âLook, since last night!âfor me, I care not though you get through all they said. All this side dashed with fits of weeping time, See you, the red struck out; an evil year. If such times vex me till no sleep feels good, It is not that I think of such lewd words With wine still hot in them. Who calls it spring? Simply this winter plays at red and green. Clean white no colour for me, did they say? I never loved white roses much; but see How the wind drenches the low lime-branches With shaken silver in the rainiest leaves. Mere winter, winter. I will love you well, Sweet Constance, do but say I am not fair; No need for patience if I be not fair, For if men really lie to call me fair He need not come; I pray God keep him close For fear he come and see I am not fair. Can you not speak, not say if this be true, That I may cease? come, am I fair or no? Speak your pure mind. Const. Nay, madam, for you know Doubtless it was delight to make your face And rippled soft miraculous gold hair Over the touched veins of most tender brows Meant for men's lips to make them glad of God Who gives them such to kiss. Ros. Leave off my praise, It frets me flesh and all as sickness doth Till the blood wanes; yea, and quaint news to hear, That I am fair, have hair strung through with gold, Smooth feet, smooth hands, and eyes worth pain to see! Why once the king spake of my hair like this, âAs though rain filled and stained a tress of corn Loose i'the last sheaf of many slackened sheaves; Or ifâ (ay, thus) âone blew the yellow dust That speckles a red lily off both cheeks Held in the sun, so if in kissing her I let the wind into her hair, it blows Thin gold back, shows the redder thread of it, Burnt saffron-scented;â some faint rhyme of his Tuned round and coloured after his French wise. Const. You learnt such sonnets of him?âA man's stepâ Ah, that girl's binding the wet tendrils there Last night blew over. Ros. See, at my hand's end, Those apple-flowers beaten on a heap, So has the heavy weather trod on them. There are my rhymes all spoilt and blown with wind, Broken like birds' wings blown against a wall. Girl, do you know I lived so quiet once, Leaning whole days in a warmed side-window With the chin cushioned up and soft vague feet Thrust out to sleep, and warm sides couched for ease Full of soft blood, pulsed slow with happiness Such fair green seasons through, with dreams that lay Most blossom-soft between the lidsâand love A little way I thought above my brows, His finger touching them; yea, for whole months I was so patient to serve time and have Love's mouth at last set suddenly on mine; Abode and heard the blood that grew in me More sweet, and the days' motion in my ears Touched audibly. Const. This was a gracious time. Ros. One song you have, I pray but sing me that, I taught it you; and yet I like it not; Trouveres have sweet lips with a bitter heart, And such a gracious liar, I doubt, wrote this; But sing it; it shall do no harm to hear. Const. Sweet, for God's love I bid you kiss right close On mouth and cheek, because you see my rose Has died that got no kisses of the rain; So will I sing to sweeten my sweet mouth, So will I braid my thickest hair to smooth, And thenâI need not call you love again. I like it well enough. Ros. The sick sweet in it Taints my mouth through.âCould the heat make me sleep! My feet ache like my head.âDoth this I say Tire you so hard you cannot answer me? Const. Madam, I would my words were wine to drink That might heal all your better sense and blood; But some hurts ache in the bone past oil and wine, And I do think the words I heard of you Burn you thus hot only with hate of shame. Ros. Shame? who said shame? am I so sick of love That shame can hurt me? there's no shame in the world Whose wound would hurt more than too hard a kiss If love kept by the face of blinking shame To kill the pain with patience. Am I his wife That it should fret me to be trod by shame? Ah child, I know that were my lord at right And shame stood on this left with eager mouth For some preparÃ¨d scornâI could but turn Sayingâlo, here this hand to cover me, Lo, this to plait my hair and warm my lips; I could well pity thee, dull snake, poor fool, Faint shame, too feeble to discredit me. Const. I would I had never come hither. Ros. Are you tired? But I seem shameful to you, shameworthy, Contemnable of good women, being so bad, So bad as I am. Yea, would God, would God, I had kept my face from this contempt of yours. Insolent custom would not anger me So as you do; more clean are you than I, Sweeter for gathering of the grace of God To perfume some accomplished work in heaven? I do not use to scorn, stay pure of hate, Seeing how myself am scorned unworthily; But anger here so takes me in the throat I would speak now for fear it strangle me. Here, let me feel your hair and hands and face; I see not flesh is holier than flesh, Or blood than blood more choicely qualified That scorn should live between them. Better am I Than many women; you are not over fair, Nor delicate with some exceeding good In the sweet flesh; you have no much tenderer soul Than love is moulded out of for God's use Who wrought our double need; you are not so choice That in the golden kingdom of your eyes All coins should melt for service. But I that am Part of the perfect witness for the world How good it is; I chosen in God's eyes To fill the lean account of under men, The lank and hunger-bitten ugliness Of half his people; I who make fair heads Bow, saying, âthough we be in no wise fair We have touched all beauty with our eyes, we have Some relish in the hand, and in the lips Some breath of it,â because they saw me once; I whose curled hair was as a strong staked net To take the hunters and the hunt, and bind Faces and feet and hands; a golden gin Wherein the tawny-lidded lions fell, Broken at ankle; I that am yet, ah yet, And shall be till the worm hath share in me, Fairer than love or the clean truth of God, More sweet than sober customs of kind use That shackle pain and stablish temperance; I that have roses in my name, and make All flowers glad to set their colour by; I that have held a land between twin lips And turned large England to a little kiss; God thinks not of me as contemptible, And that you think me even a smaller thing Than your own goodness and slight name of good, Your special, thin, particular repute; I would some mean could be but clear to me Not to contemn you. Const. Madam, I pray you think I had no will to whet you to such edge; I might wish merely to be clear of pain Such as I have to see you weepâto see That wasp contempt feed on your coloured rind Whose kernel is so spiced with change of sweet; No more, I swear to you by God no more. Ros. I will believe you. But speak truly now As you are fair, I say you are fair too, Would you be wiser than I was with him? A king to kiss the maiden from your lips, Fill you with fire as water fills the sea, Hands in your hair and eyes against your faceâ Ay, more than this, this need not strike at heart, But say that love had bound you like a dog, Leashed your loose thoughts to his uncertain feet, Then would you be much better than such are As leave their soul upon two alien lips Like a chance word of talk they use for breath? O girl, that hast no bitter touch of love, No more assurance of it than report Flaunts in the teeth of blameâI bid you know Love is much wiser than we twain, more strong Than men who hold the pard by throat and jaw. Love's signet-brand stamps through the gold o'the years, Severs the gross and chastens out the mould. God has no plague so perilous as love, And no such honey for the lips of Christ To purge them clean of gall and sweet for heaven. It was to fit the naked limbs of love He wrought and clothed the world with ordinance. Yea, let no wiser woman hear me say I think that whoso shall unclothe his soul Of all soft raiment coloured custom weaves, And choose before the cushion-work of looms Stones rough at edge to stab the tender side, Put honour off and patience and respect And veils and relics of remote esteem To turn quite bare into large arms of love, God loves him better than those bitter fools Whom ignorance makes clean, and bloodless use Keeps colder than their dreams. Const. It may be true, I know not; only to stay maiden-souled Seems worthier to me. Ros. Doth it so? Ah you That tie the spirit closer to the flesh To keep both sweet, it seems again to me You kill the gracious secret of it, and mar The wholesome heaven with scent of ruined things That breed mere flies for issue. Ay, and love That makes the daily flesh an altar-cup To carry tears and rarest blood within And touch pained lips with feast of sacramentâ So sweet it is, God made it sweet! Poor words, Dull words, I have compassion on them, girl, Their babble falls so far this side of love Significance faints in them. This I know, When first I had his arms across my head And had his mouth upon my heated hair And his sharp kisses mixed into my blood, I hung athirst between his hands, and said Sweet, and so sweet! for both mine eyes were weak, Possessed with rigorous prophecy of tears To drench the lids past sleeping, and both lips Stark as twain rims of a sweet cup drunk out. Const. My first word serves me here; this may be true. Ros. Say this, you have a tender woman's face, Do you love children? does it touch your blood To see God's word finished in a child's face For us to touch and handle? seems it sweet To have such things in the world to hold and kiss? Const. Yea, surely. Ros. Yea? then be most sure of this, Love doth so well surpass and foil the sense That makes us pleasure out of children seen, That I being severed from the lips of mine Feel never insufficient sight, or loss Of the sweet natural aim or use in eyes Because they are not; but for only this; That seldom in grave passages of time Such gracious red possesses the full day As leaves me light to look into his face Who made me children. Const. Doth he love you as well? Then two such loves were never wrought in flesh Since the sun moved. Ros. Ah girl, you fail fair truth; He doth love me, would let me take his name To soil, his face to set my feet upon; But love is no such new device we need Boast over that. Nay, are you dull indeed? All stories are so lined and sewn with love, Ravel that gold and broidered thread in them, You rend across the mid and very seam. Yea, I am found the woman in all tales, The face caught always in the story's face; I Helen, holding Paris by the lips, Smote Hector through the head; I Cressida So kissed men's mouths that they went sick or mad, Stung right at brain with me; I Guenevere Made my queen's eyes so precious and my hair Delicate with such gold in its soft ways And my mouth honied so for Launcelot, Out of good things he chose his golden soul To be the pearlwork of my treasuring hands, And so our love foiled God; I that was these And am no sweeter now than Rosamond With most full heart and mirth give my lord up Body's due breath and soul's forefashioned peace To pay love with; what should I do but this That am so loved? Ay, you might catch me here Saying his French wife smites my love across With soft strange lips; yea, I know too she may Pluck skirts of afterthought, kiss pity's feet, Marry remembrance with a broken ring; No time so famished, no such idle place As spares her room next his; a wife, his wifeâ If I be no king's wife, prithee what need That she should steal the word to dress her name That suits my name as well? take love, take all; What shall keep hunger from the word of wife? What praise, if reputation wear thin shoes, Shall keep the rain from honoured women's feet? Wife, wifeâI get no music out of wife; I see no reason between me and wife But what breath mars with making; yea, poor fool, She gets the harsh bran of my corn to eat. Const. Men call the queen an adder underfoot, Dangerous obedience in the trodden head; I pray you heed your feet in walking here. Ros. Fear is a cushion for the feet of love, Painted with colours for his ease-taking; Sweet red, and white with wasted blood, and blue Most flower-like, and the summer-spousÃ¨d green And sea-betrothed soft purple and burnt black. All coloured forms of fear, omen and change, Sick prophecy and rumours lame at heel, Anticipations and astrologies, Perilous inscription and recorded note, All these are covered in the skirt of love And when he shakes it these are tumbled forth, Beaten and blown i'the dusty face of the air. Were she ten queens and every queen his wife, I could not find out fear. Where shame is hid I can but guess when patience leaves me sick; But where the lank bat fear is huddled in Doth no conjecture smell. Const. Mine holds yet out, Seeing the queen is reconciled: their son Ties peace between both hands; she will do much To move him from his care set over you. Ros. I care not; let her bind him heel to head, So she may keep him, clip and kiss him so. For me, I will go in; no doubt he shall Be here to-night; I were best sleep till then And have the sweet of sleep about my face To touch his senses with; for he shall come, I have no doubt of him but he shall come. Kiss me yet, sweet, I would not anger you. [Exit. Const. Yea, I taste through this way of yours; so fair Her sin may serve as well as holy ways, Shall not it so? Let the queen make some tale, A silk clue taken in the king's spur's gold, No fear lest I be taken; and what harm To catch her feet i'the dragnets of her sin That is so full of words, eats wicked bread, Shares portion with shame's large and common cups, Feeds at lewd tables, girds loose garments on? For all this brave breath wasted out of heart, I doubt this frets her; verily I think Some such pain only makes her gibe at meâ Fair fool, with her soft shameful mouth! at least I keep clean hands to do God's offices And serve him with my noose upon her neck. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. The Palace at Shene. Queen Eleanor and Robert de Bouchard. Queen Eleanor. Yea, true for such; but he and I were old Already, though men say his hair keeps black, Ay, black-bright hair, touched deep as poppies' black They cover up in scarlet; that's my lord; Sweet colour, with a thought of black at heart. Some flowers, they say, if one pluck deep enough, Bleed as you gather. Bouch. That means love, I think; You gather it and there's the blood at root. Qu. El. How much, my Bouchard? let your beard alone; You could well strike me, I believe at heart; God help me that am troubled with you so! Feel both hands now; the blood's alive there, beats And flutters in the fingers and the palms. Bouch. True, hot enough; what will you do? the king Comes back to take farewell and hold his way With some thin train that gathers Londonwards; Thence ere he take ship shall my lord make way Among the westward alder-meadows, thrust Between soft Godstow poplars and warm grass Right into Woodstock and pleached rose-places; Shall the queen follow lest he lack a face For welcome, and sweet words to kiss i'the lip? I would go with you lest some harm should fall. Qu. El. No need, for would God let them hurt me? Well, I would fain see the rose grow, Robert. Bouch. Being fair, A woman is worth pains to see. Qu. El. Being fair. Sweet stature hath she and fair eyes, men say; I am but black, with hair that keeps the braid, And my face hurt and bitten of the sun Past medicine of all waters; so his tooth Bites hard in France, and strikes the brown grape hot, Makes the wine leap, no skin-room spares for white,â I know well now; the woman has that white, His water-weed, his golden girl-flower With lank sapped stem and green rind moist at core. Ay, gold! but no crown's gold to all this hair, That's hard, my Robert. Bouch. See how men will lie; They call you hard, this people, sour to bite; Now I will trust your sweetness, do but say You will not touch her if I get you through. Qu. El. I will not hurt her, Bouchard; for God's love, Help me; I swear by God I will not hurt, I will notâAh, sweet Robert, bear me through, Do not make smiles and never move your mouth: When we ride back I will do anything, Wear man's dress, take your horse to waterâyea, Kiss clean your feet of any travelling dustâ Yea, what your page has never done I will For mere love, Robert, for pure love of you; Nay, if I meant to stab or poison her, You might so chide me, Bouchard, bid me back, Not now! I will not hurt her; there again. Kiss me! I love you as a man loves God! Be sorry for me! Bouch. Ah well, well; no doubt But my Lord wrought me with a tender hand, Spoiled half a man in making; there, sit, sit. I felt your teeth come through that bitter kiss. Sit now and talk; it is my service, madam, A man's good service merely, nothing else, To ride for you, to ride with youânot more. Qu. El. I have some help yet of this Bouchard, then? See now, sir, you are knight and gentleman; I pray you that your service fail not here. For wears a man rich office and rich name Nearer than wife about him? so the king Wears me; and so I bid you serve him, sir. I bid you? rather I take prayer to me And catch your faith with prayer; right meek I am, Chide with me, Bouchard, if I be not meek; No child was ever so milk-mouthed, no bird That picks out seed from scented and pink palms. To say soft words is seasonable; and good To think of all men smoothly; else a sin May sting you suddenlyâas him it stungâ Hell's heat burn through that whorish mouth of hers! Bouch. Madam! Qu. El. And God that knows I weep! Bouch. Keeps count (The monks' song says it) of your flitting times, Seals all your tears up safely, doth he not? Hark, there's one singing. Qu. El. But no monk this time. Look, in the garden by the red wall's turn, The king's fool under covert, and steals fruit; Pluck such raw pears and spoil so bad a song, That breaks my patience; a lewd witch-burden! One sings outside:â This was written in God's name; The devil kissed me Mouth on mouth with little shame Under a big tree. He fed me full with good meat, The best there might be; He gave me black wine and sweet Red fruit and honey-meal to eat; Domine, laudamus te. He made straight the lame And fat he made me; So he gat good game, Kisses three by three. He was shapen like a carl, A swine's foot had he; Like a dog's his mouth did snarl, His hands were foul with loam and marl; Domine, laudamus te. Qu. El. Eh, what lewd words so mutter in his teeth? I hear no good ones; bid them see him whipped. Outside:â A bat came out of heaven That had a flat snout; A loaf withouten leaven, Crumbs thereof fell out; The devil thrust up with his thumb, Said tho to me, Lo you, there shall be left no crumb When I and you in heaven come; Domine, laudamus te. There were many leavÃ¨s thick Grown well over me; A big branch of a little stick Is this greenÃ¨ tree; He showed me brave things to wear, Pleasant things to see; A good game had we twain there, The leavÃ¨s weren broad and fair; Domine, laudamus te. Qu. El. Bid the grooms whip him; even a dog like that Can be a fret to me, a thorn-prick. Ah, Such beasts as feed about us, and we make Communion of their breath! I am sick at him. Why, my sweet friend, I pray you of your love Do me some service. Bouch. Nay, the fool's no harm; Let be a little; service was your word? See now, he creeps by nodding his fool's head, With back and shoulders rounded for the sun; Let the poor beast be; 'tis no worse than dogs When the rain makes them howl, soaks to the bone As he is sodden through the wits of him. Now, sweet, sit closer, talk with me; you said Service? what service must I do? the king, It's the king has me at his heels, a dog For service; the best work one does for love; As I do service for my lord the king. Qu. El. Ay, for you love him; I have learnt you, sir, Can say my Bouchard through and turn the leaf. Are you his servant, lackey, chattel, purse, The sheath where he's the hilt? you love him; eh? Bouch. Service and love make lordship stable; well, Suppose I love him; there be such about As would stoop shoulder and fit knee to bear Worse weight than I do, only for pure loveâ Clean love, that washes out so much! Qu. El. Ah, sir, They make you laugh, then? Bouch. Well, not loud; a brush That strikes one's lips with laughter as a fly Touches a fruit and drops clean off, you see. Men love so, pay them wages (ah, not gold, No gold of course, but credit, name, safe room, Broad space to sun the back and cram the sides And shake fat elbows and grow longer beardsâ There's all one wants, now) pay them such, I sayâ Lo, sir, our friend hath never wrought for that, That he should take it; love holds otherwhere Than by the purfled corners of your sleeve, Eats no such food as keeps your pages warm Nor wears such raiment. Qu. El. Ay, my Bouchard, so? I've measure of you somewhere; why serve me? Why sweat and crawl to get me such a rose And save my gloves one thorn? Bouch. Nay, I know not; Find some clean reason for a miry foot Or tell me why God makes the sun get up Pricked out like a tame beast, I'll answer you Why I am pleased to be so serviceable. But why our friend's lip tastes a sweet therein Who serves for honesty? this were more hard to say. Still the truth stands, he'll work some three good hours Outside your hireling; yea, that's much for him; And all to get such dog's wage as a rag To wrap some naked wound's unseemliness Caught serving you, lest the sight turn your blood And swell your sick throat out at him. Qu. El. No more? I doubt you do belie both sides of love. Bouch. But ask him rather; there's Jean Becqueval, King Louis has him throttled up in steel That was a strong knight once, and had broad bones To get the mail shut over, not so tight. A keen sword, madam, makes blunt work in time, For this man struck two blows for you or three Some years back, when your courtiers snarled and spat; Who might have children beat him on his mouth And could not shake about the chin for spite To save their plucking at his beard. Poor fool, I dare well say he hates you not the least, Most like would bite now for you with his teeth, Since both hands could not pull the scabbard straight Or loose the band o'the visor and not let The steel snap on his fingers. Qu. El. If you say truth, I swear by God's blood I am shamed in it, Shamed out of face; but I misdoubt you lie Your old hard way, lie perfectly. Be good, Say you did lie. Bouch. I have said short of truth. Nay, now you find this wound in him of yours, Should you fall weeping? ask our lord so much; He'll swear by God's face, finger his own beard, And twist a hawk's foot round or hurt its neck, And say by God such things are pitiful. Come, is your friend less pinched for his good will? You know he would not, set things broadly down, Sweep this cast up and leave him room to throw, Change his soiled coat to be set clean in gold; He would just choose to serve you his best way Something beyond my warrant. Why, in France Last March the king's friend, Guerrat of SalliÃ¨res, âA good knightâhas that long mouth like a toad's, And eats a woman like a grape with itâ (Spits the husk out I mean and strains the core) Spake thus to me; âSir Robert, there's a man Lies flat with rust upon his lips to chew Who while your Queen touched Paris with her feet Would have plucked out his hairs for cushion-stuff To save her shoes a sprinkle of weak rainâ Burnt out his eyes a-sputter in the head If she misliked their colour.â Qu. El. Not SalliÃ¨res? Bouch. It was my question; at which word thrown out His head went sideways as a big fish flaps And shoves with head and body, showing white I'the black oil of sea-water before storm (You take such off-shore with sides weltering) And the cheeks got quick twinkles of eased flesh And the chin laughed; âBy Mary's hand,â he said, âI think I would not.â Qu. El. Ah, the fool he was! Is he grown fat? he must be fat by this. Bouch. I held to him; what name and ways and work, Where the man hid; whereat my Guerrat rolls And chattersââBy the milk of Pilate's nurse And by the sleeve that wiped king Herod's beard, I hope the place be something worse than hell, Or I shall fare the worse next world, by God!â Qu. El. What noise runs towards us? is the king past Thames Think you, by this?âTake this one word of me; Albeit I lay no heavy thought on it Lest pain unmake me, hold this truth of mine, Sir Robert, which your swordsmen and blank wits, I doubt, would feel for half one's life and miss; I had sooner fare as doth this Becqueval Than as I fare; yea, if a man will weep, Let him weep here. God is no good to me, Nor any man i'the world; I have no love And no smooth hour in those twelve pricks of plague That smite my blood each once a day. Nay, go; Do me some greeting to my lord. Farewell. [Exit Bouchard. I shall find time to hate you; yea, I do Hate him past speech. Let me just cool my head And gather in some breath to face the kingâ I am quite stilled. Enter King Henry. Fair days upon my lord. K. Hen. How does the queen?âThreeânot four provinces To shut one's hand on.âAre you well?ânext month My face at Paris and his hands in mine Touch service; two, three provinces at most; I must have more. Qu. El. I thank you, well enough. How doth my Paris?âThat means ill to me, That beat of his two fingers on the cheek. Will Bouchard make no liar, does one know? K. Hen. Fair news; our Louis to the throat in steel, And cannot clear his saddle at a leap, But slips and sticks there as he did years back, Not in the saddle but across a bed His feet in time drew clear of and made room. Qu. El. Made room for you to slide between and thrust Across the pillows with a sideways head To warm about the corner where his feet Were thrust out late; so God keep heat for it To please you always! K. Hen. Ay, not best at swords, Good Louis; I was eased with swinging steel In thick fields under lusty months of sun; He would play blind, wring back my hand in his, Fall in hard thought. But see now; have I not A dozen French heads broken through the neck Hung at my sleeve here, madam, threes and threes? Guy d'HÃ©ricourt and Guerrat of SalliÃ¨res, Denis of Gordes, Peter of the March, I have their tongues shut with gold coins of mine To seal the lips back; Jacques Becqueval Shows teeth to nibble; if these fail me quite, I'll say we have played at luck with God and lost By some trick's foil; being no such fools of his As chew the lazy purpose with their teeth, Eat and wax full and laugh till hair falls out; Why, all the world lives without sleeping-whiles, God makes and mars and turns not weak one whit, But we must find some roost to perch and blink And wag thick chins at the world; I hate all men That have large faces with dead eyes in them And good full fronts of fool. Qu. El. Am I worth words? K. Hen. So quick, so quick! are you true wife to me? Qu. El. I praise God for it, how loyal I have lived Your soul shall answer. K. Hen. What, I see the blood That goes about the heart and makes you hotâ French blood, south blood! I would not tax you far, But spare my Louis; he did no such wrong As I did when I let you slip my hand In a new French glove you had sewn with gold. Qu. El. This is a courteous holiness of yours That smites so in my face; have you not heard Of men whose swervÃ¨d feet lie delicate In common couches, with beds made to them Where priests shed no fair water? Nay, this breath You chide me with makes treason to your breath That was my promise; if I be your wife, The unclean witness of my well-doing Is your own sin. K. Hen. This is a fevered will That you seem drunk withal. Qu. El. I bond-broken? You lay your taint my way; blush now a little, Pay but some blood; do but defend yourself; It is a double poison in revolt When it deserts the bare rebellion To be half honest. K. Hen. You are not wise. Qu. El. I would not: For wisdom smites awry, when foolishness Keeps the clean way. K. Hen. Have you done yet with me? Qu. El. I thrust your bags out with round cheeks of gold That were my people's; thickened with men the sides Of your sick, lean, and barren enterprise; Made capable the hunger of your state With subsidies of mine own fruitfulness; Enriched the ragged ruin of your plans With purple patched into the serge and thread Of your low state; you were my pensioner; There's not a taste of England in your breath But I did pay for. K. Hen. Better I had never seen you Than wear such words unchallenged. You are my wife; I would the name were lost with mine to it. I put no weight upon you of the shame That is my badge in you; the carriage of it Pays for your gold. Qu. El. Ay, you will tax not me, Being made so whole of your allegiance, you, Perfect as patience? why, the cause, this cause (Be it what you sayâbut saying it you lie, Are simply liar, my lord!) the shame would prick A very dog to motion of such blood As takes revenge for the shame done, the shame I'the body, in the sufferance of a blowâ But you are patient. K. Hen. I will not find your sense. Qu. El. Nay, I think so; when you do understand, Praise me a little then. For this time, sir, I have no such will to trouble you; and here, Even here shall leave-taking atone us twain; Therefore farewell. When I am dead, my lord, I pray you praise me for my sufferance; You see I chide not; nay, I say no word; I will put seals like iron on my mouth Lest it revolt at me, or any shame Push some worse phrase in than âGod keep you, sir.â [Exit. K. Hen. I am her fool; no word to get her dumb? I am like the tales of Cornish Mark long since, To be so baffled. Well, being this way eased, I need not see her anger twice i'the eyes; Get me a hawk to ride with presently. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. At Woodstock. King Henry and Rosamond, seated. Rosamond. Belle est madame, et bien douce en son dire; Dieu lui fit don de pleurer ou de rire Plus doucement que femme qui soupire Et puis oublie. Bonne est madame, et me baise de grace; Bien me convient baiser si belle face, Bien me convient que si doux corps embrasse Et plus n'oublie. Blonde est madame, ayant de tristes yeux; Entre or et roux Dieu fit ses longs cheveux; Bien mal me fait, si l'en aime bien mieux, Et moins oublie. Blanche est madame et gracieuse Ã  voir; Ne sais si porte en corps azur ou noir; Que m'a donnÃ© sa belle bouche avoir Jamais n'oublie. I bade them tell you I was sick; the sun Pains me. Sit here. K. Hen. There's no sick show in you. Sing still, and I will sit against your feet And see the singing measure in your throat Moved evenly; the headband leaves your hair Space to lie soft outside. Ros. Stoop then and touch That I may bind it on your hands; I would Fain have such hands to use so royally. As you are king, sir, tell me without shame Doth not your queen share praise with you, show best In all crowned ways even as you do? I have heard Men praise the state in her and the great shape; Yet pray you, though you find her sweet enow, Praise her not over-measure; yet speak truth; But so I would not have you make her praise The proper pleasure of your lips, the speech Found best in them; yet do not scant her so That I may see you tender of my pain, Sparing to gall my wits with laud of her. K. Hen. O sweet, what sting is this she makes in you? A Frenchwoman, black-haired and with grey lips And fingers like a hawk's cut claw that nips One's wrist to carryâis this so great a thing As should wring wet out of your lids? Ros. I know That for my sake you pinch her praises in, Starve her of right; do not so fearfully; I shall best love you if you praise her, seeing I would not have you marry a worse face, Say, than mine even; therefore be liberal, Praise her to the full, till you shall see that I Fall sick upon your words, bid them be pitiful And bruise not me. K. Hen. I will not praise her to you. Show me a little golden good of yours, But some soft piece of gracious habit grown Common with you, quite new with me and sweet. It is the smell of roses where you come That makes my sense faint now; you taste of it, Walk with it always. Ros. Hark, the rain begins, Slips like a bird that feels among shut leaves; Oneâtwo; it catches in the rose-branches Like a word caught. Now, as I shut your eyes, Show me what sight gets first between the lids, So covered in to make false witness true. Speak, and speak faith. K. Hen. I think this first; here once The hard noon being too strong a weight for us, We lay against the edges of slant leaves Facing the grass, our bodies touching them, Cooled from the sun, and drank cold wine; you had A straight gown flaked with gold i'the undersleeves; And in your throat I caught the quick faint red Drunk down, that ran and stained it out of white, A long warm thread not coloured like a vein But wine-coloured; this was a joy to see. O little throat so tender to show red, Would you not wear my lips as well, be kissed To a soft mark if one but touched you so? I will not touch; only to feel you fast, Lie down and take your feet inside both hands, Untie your hair to blind both eyes acrossâ Yea, there sweet, kiss me now. Ros. Do but stoop yet And I will put my fingers where the hair Is mixed upon the great crown's wearing-place; Sir, do you think I must fall old indeed First of us two? look how between my wrists Even about the purplest beat of them This lean scant flesh goes in. I am grown past love; The breath aches each way in my sobbing sides When I would sing, and tears climb up my throat In bitter breaks like swellings of round fruit From the rind inwards, and my pulses go Like fits of singing when the head gives way And leaves pure nought to stammer in spoilt lips, Even for this and my sad patience here Built up and blinded in with growing green, Use me not with your eyes untenderly, But though I tire you, make you sigh at me, Say no blame overloud; I have flowers only And foolish ways to get me through the day, And songs of yours to piece with weeping words And famish and forget. Pray you go now, I am the abuse of your compassion. K. Hen. I am gone presently; but for this space Give me poor leave to love you with mine eyes And feasted expectation of shut lips. God help! your hair burns me to see like gold Burnt to pure heat; your colour seen turns in me To pain and plague upon the temple-vein That aches as if the sun's heat snapt the blood In hot mid measure; I could cry on you Like a maid weeping-wise, you are so fair It hurts me in the head, makes the life sick Here in my hands, that one may see how beats Feverous blue upon my finger-tips. Touch me now gently; I am as he that saith In the great song sick words and sorrowful Of love's hard sweet and hunger of harsh hours; Your beauty makes me blind and hot, I am Stabbed in the brows with it. Ros. Yea, God be good, Am I fair yet? but say that I am fair, Make me assured, praise me quite perfectly Lest I doubt God may love me something less And his hot fear so nip me in the cheek That I burn through. Nay, but go hence; I would Even lose the sweet I love, that I may lose The fear of losing it. K. Hen. I am gone quickly. You know my life is made a pain to me With angry work, harsh hands upon my life That finger in the torn sad sides of it For the old thorn; touch but my face and feel How all is thwarted with thick networking Where your lips found it smooth, clung soft; there, now, You take some bruise and gall of mine clear out With a cool kissing mouth. Ros. I had a will To make some chafing matter with your pride And laugh at last; ay, also to be eased Of some small wrath at your harsh tarriance; But you put sadness softly in my lips With your marred speech. Look, the rain slackens yet. K. Hen. I will go now that both our hearts are sweet And lips most peaceable; so shall we sleep Till the next honey please them, with a touch Soft in our mouths; sing once and I am gone. Ros. I will sing something heavy in the word That it may serve us; help me to such words. The marigolds have put me in my song, They shine yet redly where you made me it. HÃ©las, madame, ayez de moi merci, Qui porte en cÅur triste fleur de souci; N'est plus de rose, et plus ne vois ici Que triste fleur. M'est trop grand deuil, hÃ©las, dans cette vie; Car vieil espoir me lie et me dÃ©lie, Et triste fleur m'est force, Ã´ belle amie, Porter en cÅur. See the rain! have you care to ride by this? Yea, kiss me one strong kiss out of your heart, Do not kiss more; I love you with my lips, My eyes and heart, your love is in my blood, I shall die merely if you hold to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. Ante-Chapel at Shene. Choir-music from within. In the passage outside, Arthur, a boy of the choir, reading. Enter Sir Robert de Bouchard. Bouchard. She spares me time to think of it; well, so I pull this tumbled matter square with God, What sting can men's mouths hurt me with? What harm Because the savour of undieted sense Palates not me? the taste and smell of love Sickens me, being so fed with its keen use That delicate divisions of soft touch Feel gross to me as dullest accident? That way of will most men take pleasure in It tires my feet to walk. Then for the harder gameâ Joust where the steel swings, fight that clears up blood, I want the relish too; being no such sinewed ape, Blunder of brawn and jolted muscle-work, As beats and bleeds about his iron years, Anoints his hide with stupid lust and sleep, Fattens to mould and dies; rubs sides with dust, Ending his riddle. I have seen time enough, Struck blows and tricked and paid and won and wrought, I know not well why wrought. A monk, nowâthere's right work; Dull work or wise, body and head keep up; I should have pulled in scapular and alb To shut my head up and its work, who knows? Arthur (outside). They told me I should see the king come in; I shall not get the words out clear enough,â No time, I doubt. I wonder will he wear Chain-mail or samite-work? I would take mailâ A man fares best in good close joints of mail. FautorâI seem to catch it up their way; This time I'll come off clear yet. One rhyme sticksâ (He repeats.) Fautor meus, magne Deus, quis adversÃ¹m tibi stabit? ParÃ¹m ridet qui te videt; sponsam sponsus accusabit; Sicut herbam qui superbam flatu gentem dissipabit, Flectit cÅlum quasi velum quo personam implicabit. There, all straight out, clean forthright singing, this; I'll see the king in the face and speak out hard That he shall hear me. Last time all fell wrong; I had that song about the lily-plants Growing up goodly in their green of time With gold heads and gold sprinkles in the neck And God among them, feeding like a lamb That takes out sin; so I let slip his nameâ Euh! I can touch the prints of the big switch; One, six, twelve,âah! the sharp small suckers stung Like a whole hive loose, as Hugh's arm swung out. Good for this king that I shall see to have Fine padded work and silk seats pillow-puft Instead of wood to twist on painfully. Bouch. So comes mine answer in; I thank you, Lord; I'll none of this. Give men clean work and sleep, And baby bodies this priest's blessed way. But, being so set between the time's big jaws To dodge and keep me from the shut o'the teeth, Shuffle from lip to lip, a shell with priest For kernel in the husk and rind of knight,â No chink bit in me, but nigh swallowed wholeâ Who says my trick that, played on either, makes Music for me and sets my head on work, Is devil's lesson? Pity that lives by milk Suckles not me; I see no reason set To keep me from the general use of things Which no more holds the great regard of man Than children spoiling flies. Respect and habit Find no such tongue against me; I but wear The raiment of my proper purpose, not The threadworn coat of use. Even who keeps on Such garments for the reputation's want, Wears them unseamed inside. The boy there nowâ Arth. Yea, I loathe Hugh. Peter he beat, and meâ Me twice, because that day the queen came in I twisted back my head to thrust well through The carved work's double lattice to get sight Of a tall woman with gold clothes and hair That shone beyond her clothes; so sharp he smote, The grim beast Hugh with boarish teeth and hair All his chin long and where no hair should be! And Peter pinched and pushed all vespers through To get my turn and see her. How she went Holding her throat up, with her round neck out Curdwhite, no clot in it not smooth to strokeâ All night I shook in sleep for that one thing, Stirred with my feet and pulled about awry. I think too she kept smiling with her mouth (Her wonderful red quiet mouth) and prayed All to herself. Now that men call a mouthâ And Hugh's begrimed big lips you call the same That make a thick smile up with all their fat Never but when he gets one by the nape To make him sprawl and weep. How all the hair Drew the hard shining of the candle-fires And shone back harder with a flare in it Through all the plaits and bands. Then Hugh saidââLook, You Arthur, that white woman with such eyes Is worse in hell than any devil that seethes; She keeps the colour of it in her hair That shakes like flame so. Wait till I get in And teach the beast's will in your female flesh With some red slits in it, to get out loose In such dog's ways.â But Hugh lied hard, I think; For he said after in his damned side-room What fierce account God made of such a name And how the golden king that made God songs Chid at their ways and called them this and that; And he loved many queens with just such hair And such good eyes, and had more scores of them Than I have stripes since last red week on me. So I can see Hugh lied. For no Jew's wife Looked ever so, or found such ways to hold Her sweet straight body.âBut my nextâthat's hard. (Reads.) Bouch. Yea, there the snake's head blinks? yea, doth it there? O this sweet thorn that worries the kind flesh! Yea, but the devil's seedling side-graft, Lord, That pinches out the sap.âI'll talk to him. Enter from the Chapel Queen Eleanor. Qu. El. Ah, you here, Bouchard? is it well with you When you hear music? I am hot i'the face; Kiss me now, Robert, where the red begins, And tell me, does no music hurt you? Ahâ Will no man stop them? Bouch. Speak me lower then; No time to kiss bad words out on the mouth As one treads flame out with the heel. Well were it, That you should keep the purpose in your lips From knowledge of your eyes; let none partake, No inquisition of the air get out One secret, or the imperious sun compel One word of you. Wisdom doth sheath her hand To smite the fool behind. Qu. El. I pray you, sir, Let be your sentence; O, I am sick to death, Could lie down here and bruise my head with stone, Cover up hands and feet and die at once. Nathless I will not have her eyes and hair Crown-circled, and her breasts embraced with gold, When the grave catches me. It is mere time, The mere sick fault of age I limp with; yea, Time was I had put such fierce occasion on Like a new scented glove; but now this thing Tastes harsh as if I drank that blood indeed Which I'll not even have spilled in dust; it clings, Under the lip, makes foul the senseâha, there, I knew that noise was close upon my head. Arthur (outside). Matrem pater, fratrem frater, iste condemnabit eum; Erit nemo quem postremo tu non incusabis reum; Nihil tactum quod non fractum; fulgor ibit ante Deum; Mea caro prodest rarÃ²; non est laudi caput meum. Qu. El. Say now you love me, Robert; I fear God, Fear is more bitter than a hurt worm's tooth, But if God lets one love me this side heaven And puts his breath not out, then shall I laugh I'the eyes of him for mere delight, pluck off Fear that ties man to patience, white regret, All mixture of diseasÃ¨d purpose, made To cut the hand at wrist; remorse and doubt Shall die of want in me. Bouch. Too much of this; Get your eyes back. Think how some ten days gone He drew loose hair into his either hand And how the speech got room between their mouths Only to breathe in and go out; at times, How she said âEleanorâ to try the name, Found not so sweet as Rosamond to say; Perhaps too, âLove, the Frenchwoman gets thin, Her mouth is something older than her hair; Count by these petals, pluck them three and three, What months it takes to rid the sun of her, And make some grave-grass wealthier;â will you bear This? Qu. El. Do men tie the sword this way, or that? Were I a knight now I would gird it on Strained hard upon the clasp, would feel the hilt Bruise my side blue and work the stamp therein Deep as blood hides i'the flesh. I love pain well to feel; As to wring in one's fingersâthe least pain; It kills the hard impatience of the soul, Cools heat of head, makes bearable all shame That finds a work to do; yea, very sense Tastes it for comfort, gets assured with it, Being strong to smite the flesh, and wear pain well. She must hate pain, that woman; it should jar Her thin soft sense through, tear it up like silk; What, if worms eat me that sweet flesh in time? Arthur (outside). Motu mentis quasi ventis facit maria levari; Ex avenÃ¢ flatu plenÃ¢ facit dulcem sonum dari; Tument colles quasi folles quia jussit exsufflari, Et quÅ deplet manu replet labra calicis amari. Qu. El. Ay, bitter; for it bites and burns one through As the sharp sting of wine curdles the mouth. He would not wed her if I died? I knowâ A laugh with all his teeth in it, the beard So twisted from the underlip aboutâ Eh, said he that he would not marry her? Bouch. Nay, but who deemed else? no man certainly. When the weak lust falls dead and eyeless flesh Is as a beast asleep and sick of meat, What marvel if no spirit there holds out? No appetite, that like the unchilded sea (In whose unprofitable and various womb Fair ships lie sidelong with a fisher's buoy Miles down in water) hungers for such orts As riot spares lean want, is yet so wide, So vast of ravin or so blind in scope, As can abide the chewed and perished meats That relish died upon. Fill famine to the lips, The word of bread shall turn his throat awry; So doth the sense of love all love put out, And kiss it from that very place o'the soul Mere wish made sweet indeed. Qu. El. I am sorry for you; This foolish poison in your tongue forgets All better things to say. Bouch. It is dull truth; This gift found in me should much profit you. Qu. El. I care not for you; I could wish you hanged But for some love that sticks here in my head, Some stupid trick caught upâlike play with straws, Tune-burden twisted over in sick ears That keeps up time with fever; so habit fools me To use you like a friend. Bouch. It is a piteous thing When honesty grown grey has hairs plucked out By such unreverent fingers. Come, let be; I marvel what lewd matter jars your talk So much past tune. Qu. El. 'Tis better talk than do Where doing means actual harm. Perchance this thing Shall trap our souls indeed,âeh? Bouch. Doubt me not; I think so truly. Prithee let us in, Wash hands and weep. Qu. El. You have marred my will to prayer. God is right gracious, maybe he shall help, As we do honourably. I will not go. Arthur (outside). Multo fletu non expletu facit teneras pupillas; Dente tangi, manu frangi jubet nitidas mamillas; Quum amÅnÅ parum genÅ nudas exhibent maxillas, Fiet gravis odor suavis si quis osculabit illas. Qu. El. Who made that hymn? Bouch. Aloys of Blois. Qu. El. Ah priest! You should be priest, my Bouchard, scalp and mouth, You have such monk's ways. If she be foul to God And her sweet breath ill savour in his lip, Then shall her blood-spilling be sacrifice And cleanse us in the blow. I do thank God, I praise the wording of his prayer, will make Fast and sweet words and thereto thanksgiving, Be married to his love, my purpose making Such even wing and way with his. Bouch. Yea, first Show me the perfect fashion of her death. Qu. El. What fashion? feel this flasket next my waist, Full to the wicked lips, crammed up and full With drugs and scents that touch you in the mouth And burn you all up, face and eyes at onceâ They say so; they may lie, who knows? but kill The thing does really; do you kiss me now? Bouch. Some Frenchman gave my queen the thing to keep? Qu. El. I wot well England would not give a queen Six grains of salt she paid in salt of tears. France makes good blood, made Becqueval and me; I bade him get me for love's sakeâyears goneâ Such mortal matter. Ah, poor Becqueval, A good time had we in that pleasance-walk; I with few dames about the white pear-treesâ Spring was it? yea, for green sprang thick as flame And the birds bit the blossom and sang hardâ Now sat and tore up flowers to waste, wet strips Of hyacinth, rain-sodden bellsâthen stood To make them braid my running hair well back, Pluck out the broken plait of March-lilies, Lest one should mutterââHa, the queen comes late, Her hair unwoven and cheeks red as though Fingers and lips had kissed and fondled themâ Ay, pity of her!â so for thatâwhat words I choke with saying! Bouch. Weak in words indeed; See how I shut them back upon the mouth. The king comes here to chapel; let us hence. Qu. El. I am very ready. Nay, this turn it is; I am so free and pleasant of my mood, I can scarce go for simple joyousness. [Exeunt. Arthur (outside). Pater, e me mendas deme, fac ut cingar prece suavi; Pater, e me vinum preme, fac ut purgar fÅce gravi; Tu me bonis imple donis ut implentur melle favi, Tu me rege tuÃ¢ lege, quia mundum non amavi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. At Woodstock. Rosamond. Late summer now, but in the fair blue spring How shall God bear me? Once (men say) Lord Christ Walked between rivers in his rose-garden With some old saint who had a wife by him To feed with apple-pulp and honeycomb, A wife like Mary in king David's time Long afterâbut a snake so stung his foot He came back never, being lame at heel. A story some priest wrote out all in gold, Painting the leaves green, for a king to read; But the king burnt it; whom God therefore took And sold him to some Turk, with eyes thrust out. Here in my garden, now his feet are healed From those twin stains where bit the hanging-nails, He would not come to let me kiss them whole, Wash them with oil and wet fruits bruised to juice, Rare waters stained and scented through with roseâ Though my hair be as long as Magdalen's, As yellow, maybe. Mine eyes and eyelids ache, Too thick to see past, weeping swells them blue; And the veins narrow visibly and waste Where next the elbow neither hand could span; The flesh that wore glad colour is gone grey, And soon the hair will; yea, not milk but blood Fills my breast through, not good for any child To lay sweet lips to; I am as a gold cup With beaten edges and dry mouths of dust, That tears weep into, and that cunning man By whose wit I was fashioned lets them run And lets men break me. If I were well dead, Then were the tears all spilled over the ground And I made empty; also I pray God To get me broken quickly; else, who knows, If I live long till these years too seem grey As a flower ruined, then ere sleep at night I shall be grown too stark and thin to pray, Nor will God care to set me praying then. Maids will keep round me, girls with smooth warm hair When mine is hard, no silk in it to feel,â Tall girls to dress me, laughing underbreath, Too low for gold to tighten at the waist. Eh, the hinge sharpens at the grate across? Five minutes now to get the green walk through And turnâthe chestnut leaves will take his hair If he turn quick; or I shall hear some bud Fall, or some pebble's clink along the fence Or stone his heel grinds, or torn lime-blossom Flung at me from behind; not poppies now Nor marigolds, but rose and lime-flower. Enter Queen Eleanor. Qu. El. (To Bouchard within.) OutsideâoutsideâI bade you keep outside; Look to her people; tell me not of shame; Look to her women. Ros. Ah God! shall this be so? Qu. El. I'll have no man at hand to help her through; Not till the king be come; tush, tell not me, No treatiesâtalk of promises, you talk! I will not strike her; look to them; Lord God! I bade you have a heed; there, go now; there!â Here, golden lady, look me in the face; Give me both hands, that I may read you through, See how the blood runs, how the eyes take light, How the mouth sets when one is beautiful. Ah sweet, and shall not men praise God for you? Ros. I shall die now. Madam, you are the queen. Qu. El. Does fear so speak? Ros. Not so; for pain with me Is a worn garment or that common food That sleep comes after best; what wrath will do I make no reckoning with. Qu. El. What love hath done I keep the count of; did he not hold this way? Did you not set both hands behind his head, And curl your body like a snake's? not set Each kiss between the hair of lip and chin, Cover your face upon his knees, draw down His hands on you, shut either eye to kiss? Then it was âLove, a gold band either side, A gold ring to pull close each knot of hair!â âNay, not so; kiss me rather like a bird That lets his bill cut half the red core through And rend and bite for pleasureâeh! I felt What pinched my lips up after;ââwas it not? Did it not sting i'the blood, pluck at the breath If a bird caught his song up in the leaves? Eh! this was sweet too, that you called the king Some girl's name with no royal note in it To spoil the chatterâsome name like a kiss The lips might loose and hesitate upon? He would weave up this yellow skein of yours To knot and ravel, though his hands might pluck Some plait a little overmuch; your throat, Pure pearl, too fair to swell or strain with sobs, One would not have a rough thing rasp it round, Not steel to touch it, only soft warm silk. Will you not sing now, loose your hair well out For me to hold the gracious weft? Alas, So white you grow, love; the head drops indeed, A moan comes out of that kissed mouth of yours! You harlot, are you sick to look at me? Though my heel bruise you in the gold snake's head I choke to touch you. Ros. I shall die without. But give me time to speak; wherefore am I That am made soft in this my body's strength And in my soul smooth and affectionate So taken in your loathing? you do not right To hate me that am harmless; see my face, You will not smite me afterwards; this sin Was not begot of wilfulness in me To be your pain and a shame burning you; Yea verily, no evil will or wit Made me your traitor; there came not in my mind One thought to gall you past good patience; yea, If you could see the pained poor heart in me You would find nothing hateful toward you In all the soft red record its blood makes. Qu. El. Thou art more fool than thief; I have not seen A beaten beast so humble of its mouth, So shaming me as you; I am ashamed That such a thing can see me in the eyes. You do not think that I shall let you go Being well caught? Ah harlot, have you made Thief's japes at me, lewd guesses on my wrath, Spat towards me? and now God gives me you I shall play soft and touch you with my gloves, Nay, make my lips two kissing friends of yours Because mere love and a sweet fault i'the flesh Put you to shame? Look, you shall die for that, Because you sinned not out of hate to me That have and hate you. Do not shake at it, I will not strike you yet; what hands are mine To take such hangman's matter to their work And be clean after? but a charm I have Quick to undo God's cunning weft of flesh And mix with deadly waters the glad blood That hath so pure a sense and subtleness. This is a gracious death made out for you And praiseworthy; you shall die no base way, Seeing what king's lips have fastened in your neck. Choose me this edge to try your flesh upon That feels so preciousâlike a holy thing Kissed by some great saint's mouth, laid afterwards With taper-flame in middle altar-work, All over soft as your own lips that fed Between the king's eyesâ Ros. Madam, be merciful, You hurt me, pinching in my throat so hard. Alas, ah God, will not one speak for me? Qu. El. Yea, then choose this. Ros. I will not choose; God help! I will not choose; I have no eyes to choose; I will be blind and save the sight of choice. So shall my death, not looking on itself, Fall like a chance. Qu. El. Put me not past mine oath; I am sworn deep to lay no stroke on you. Ros. I will not drink; so shall I make defeat On death's own bitter will. Do not look hard; I know you are more sweet at heart than so. Make me the servant of your meanest house, And let your girls smite me some thrice a day, I will bear that; yea, I will serve and be Stricken for wage and bruised; give me two days A poor man puts away for idleness, Lest my soul ache with youânay, but, sweet God, Is there no thing will say a word for me, A little sad word said inside her ears To make them burn for piteous shame? you see How I weep, yea, fear wrings my body round; You know not hardly how afraid I am, But my throat sickens with pure fear, my blood Falls marred in me; and God should love you so Being found his friend and made compassionateâ Qu. El. I have a mind to pluck thee with my hands, Tear thy hair backward, tread on thee. By God, I thought no sin so sick and lame a fool As this lust is. Ros. But I will drink indeed, I will not yet; give me the sword to see How that must hurt. Qu. El. Yea, this way will you see? Ros. I cannot hold it by the edge; it is Too keen to touch the sides thereof with sight. Yea then, your drink. Qu. El. To spill here in the ground? It were good game to get white iron out As did God's priest with a king's harlot once, Burn up your hair and brand between your eyes That I might have you wear me so in red. Besides to-night the king will look for you, âEh, Rosamond? she hides then closer yet, Maybe for fear of passengers that slip Between those waters; I shall have her now, Ha love, have I said right?â would he kiss you, Spoilt face and all?âYou will die simply then? You do the wiselier. Ros. God be pitiful! No man in this sharp world to speak for me Of all that go and talkâwhy now they laugh, Chatter of me, base people, say foul thingsâ Ah God, sweet Lord, that death should be so hard. Nay, thou fair death, make me not wroth with thee; Use me the best way found in thee, fair death, And thou shalt have a pleasure of mine end, For I will kiss thee with a patient lip Even on this husk of thine; thou tender death, Do me none evil and no shame, that am So soft and have such sufferance of thee And talk such lovers' little talk; fair death, Where thou hast kissed the latest lip of man's None shall drink after. Qu. El. Cease, and be not lewd; Cease, and make haste. What harlot's wit hast thou To play death's friend this way? Ros. Yea, friends we are; I have no breath that makes a curse for you, All goes to fashion prayer that God sow pity I'the grounds of wrath; you see me that I drink; So God have patience. Qu. El. It is done indeed. Perchance now it should please you to be sure This were no poison? as it is, it is. Ha, the lips tighten so across the teeth They should bite in, show blood; how white she is, Yea, white! dead green now like a fingered leaf. Enter King Henry and Bouchard. K. Hen. Is it all done? Yea, so, love, come to me, You are quite safe, held fast; kiss me a little. Speak, hast thou done? Qu. El. So, would you praise me now? It is done well, and as I thought of it. K. Hen. O sweetest thing, you do not bleed with her? She cannot speak. By God's own holiness Each fear put on you shall be as blood wrung From her most damnÃ¨d body. Do but speak. This is just fear. Ay, come close in and weep. This is your fear? Ros. Nay, but my present death. Doth fear so ruin all the blood in one As this spoils mine? Let me get breath to help; And yet no matter; I will not speak at all, I can die without speaking. K. Hen. (to the Queen). Listen to thisâ Thou art worse caught than anything in hellâ To put thy hands upon this bodyâGod, Curse her for me! I will not slay thee yet, But damn thee some fine quiet wayâO love, That I might put thee in my heart indeed To be wept well! thou shalt be healed of herâ Poor sweet; she hath even touched thee in the neck Thou art so hurt. This is not possible O God, that I could see what thou wilt do With her when she is damned! Thou piece of hell, Is there no way to crawl out of my hate By saving her? pray God then till I come, For if my hands had room for thee I would Hew thy face out of shape.âShe will not die. This heat in her is pure, and the sweet life With holy colour doth assure itself In death's sharp face; she will not die at all. Thou art all foiled, found fool and laughable And halt and spat upon and sickâO love, Make me not mad! if you do so with me I am but dead. Ros. Do not so cry on me; I am hurt sore, but shall not die of it. Be gracious with me, set your face to mine, Tell me sweet things. I have no pain at all, I am but woman and make words of pain Where I am well indeed; only the breath Catches, for joy to have you close. I would Sing your song through; yea, I am good you said, Gracious and good; I cannot sing that out, But am I good that kiss your lips or no? That keeps yet sweet; there is not so much pain As one might weep for; a little makes us weep; To die grown old were sad, but I die worth Being kissed of you; leave me some space to breatheâ I have thanks yet. [Dies. Qu. El. So is the whole played out; Yea, kiss him. Ah, my Bouchard, you said that? K. Hen. Ay, keep the mouth at ease; shut down the lids; You see I am not riotously moved, But peaceable, all heat gone out of me. This is some trick, some riddle of a dream, Have you not known such dreams? I bid you stand, Being king and lord, I make you come and go; But say I bid my love turn and kiss me, No more obedience? here at sight of her The heart of rule is broken. No more obedience? She hath forgotten this; were I a man, Even that would slay me; I beseech you, sir, Take no care of me; I can bid you; see, I touch her face; the lips begin to stir, Gather up colour; is there sound or speech, Or pleasant red under the white of death? She will speak surely; for dead flesh is grey And even the goodliest pattern wrought of man Coldness and change disfigure; what was red A new disconsolate colour overpaints, And ever with some ill deformity The secret riddle and pure sense of flesh Becomes defeated and the rebel taste Makes new revolt at it; I pray take note of me, Here comes no new thing; do you not see her face, How it hath shut up close like any flower, With scents of sleep and hesitating sweet I'the heaviest petal of it? Note her eyes, They move and alter; and if I touched her lips (Which lest she wake I will not) they would be As red as mine; yea that pure cheek of hers Turn redder. Qu. El. Will you speak to him? Bouch. Fair lordâ K. Hen. Sir, pardon me, I know she is but dead, She is not as I am; we have sense and soul; Who smites me on the mouth or plucks by the hair, I know what feels it; stab me with a knife, I can show blood: and when the eyes turn wet, There's witness for me and apparent proof I am no less than man; though in the test I show so abject and so base a slave As grooms may snarl at, and your stabled hound Find place more worth preferment. For the queen, See how strong laughter takes her by the throat And plucks her lips! her teeth would bite, no doubt, But she keeps quiet; she should live indeed; She hath mere motion, and such life in her Accuses and impeaches the Lord God, Who wrought so miserably the shapes of man With such sad cunning. Lo you, sir, she weeps; Now see I well how vile a thing it is To wear the label and the print of life Being fashioned so unhappily; for we Share no more sense nor worthier scope of time Than the live breath that is in swine and apes As honourable, now she that made us right In the keen balance and sharp scale of God Becomes as pasture and gross meat for death, Whereon the common ravin of his throat Makes rank invasion. Time was, I could not speak But she would praise or chide me; now I talk All this time out, mere baffled waste, to get That word of her I find not. Tell me, sweet, Have I done wrong to thee? spoken thee ill? Nay, for scorn hurts me, Rosamond; be wise, As I am patient; do but bow your faceâ By God she will not! Abide you but awhile And we shall hear her; for she will not fail. She will just turn her sweet head quietly And kiss me peradventure; say no word, And you shall see her; doubtless she will grow Sorry to vex me; see now, here are two She hath made weep, and God would punish her For hardness, ay though she were thrice as fair, He would not love her; look, she would fain wake, It makes her mouth move and her eyelids rise To feel so near me.âAy, no wiser yet? Then will I leave you; maybe she will weep To have her hands made empty of me; yea, Lend me your hand to cover close her face, That she may sleep well till we twain be gone; Cover the mouth up; come each side of me. THE END.</field>
