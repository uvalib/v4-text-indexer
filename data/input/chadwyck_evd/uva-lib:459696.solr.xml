Our lord doth lyue, these things &amp; these do god vnto me yf Adonias be not slayne this day. let's away presently. Nuncius Now is Adonias slayne euen as Salomon the kinge affirmed by the hand of Bannias, &amp; Abiathar's discharged for beinge the priest of our lord, &amp; as a man of death vnto his field in Amathath is sent where he remayneth vnslayne because th'Arke of our lord before Dauid his father he caryed had, where of Ioab haueinge notice by a messenger he streight into the Tabernacle of our lord did flee &amp; on the Altars horne layd hold beinge a place of sanctuary.

And Simei that Dauid before had curst, confined was to his house in Hierusalem, &amp; that wt h this condition that he should dye, when he went out, &amp; passed ouer Iordan wc h happed after three yeares space: for when his seruants fled to Achis kinge of Geth, he thither went &amp; them backe fetched for wc h Kinge Salomon hym slew by the hand of Bannias: And so the euill to kinge Dauid done requited was And in the hand of Salomon the kingdome ys established &amp; vnto Pharaos Daughter kinge of Ãgipt he ys maryed &amp; in the citty of Dauid they will make their habitation vntill his &amp; gods house be buylt &amp; brought vnto perfection And he our Lord loues, &amp; obserues the precepts of his father Sauinge that in th'Excelses he yet sacrifice doth offer (because there ys no temple built.) &amp; the Excelses ys in Gabaon whither he ys gone, &amp; there hath for a sacrifice offered a thousand hosts. But now he cometh backe this way where fore I'l go: yet listen you &amp; here what he will say Salomon Here I'l sitt downe &amp; take my rest for I am some what weary my pleasure ys yt you my lords a while depart &amp; leaue mee God Salomon aske what thou wilt, yt I the same may geue vnto thee K. Salomon Lord thou hast wt h thy seruant Dauid my father done great mercy in that thou hast me placed in his kingdom &amp; his Throne euen as my father in thy sight hath truth &amp; iustice done. But I a litle child am, indued wt h smale vnderstandinge. in the midst of thy chosen people sett wc h are past numbringe their multitude's so great &amp; many, wherefore o lord bestow on me a duble heart, that I may understand &amp; know how for to Iudge the people &amp; discerne twixt good &amp; euill syth for to iudge so great a people there ys requird great skill God Because yu hast not for thy selfe many days of lyfe desyred nor ryches, nor thy enemyes lyues, but only wisdome asked for to discerne iudgment &amp; truth, Behold I haue done to thee according to thy words, &amp; geue thee a wyse heart &amp; witty in so much that lyke to thee none before the hath bene euer neyther shall there euer aryse any lyke to thee here after Yea &amp; besyds this that thou askt, I haue on thee bestowed Riches also &amp; glory so that no kinge that thee preceeded hath bene lyke thee. And yf thou wilt rightly walke in my ways euen as thy father Dauid did, I will prolonge thy dayes Salomon. O what a dreame haue I had while I did sitt sleepinge here Now I'l vnto Hierusalem go, there Holocausts to offer vnto our lord before the Arke, for there's a place most seemely for sacrifice where god vpon the cherubims sitts in maiesty Nuncius Since that vnto Hierusalem kinge Salomon returned he sacrificed hath to god, &amp; all his seruants feasted &amp; now is cominge forth iudgment to geue about a controuersy betwixt two women: wc h (yf you'l geue eare) you shall heare presently Molina I you beseech my lord vnto my wordes for to geue eare. I in one house together dwelt wt h this woman yt standes here &amp; was deliuered of yt child besydes her in the chamber &amp; on the thirde day after shee deliuerd was of an other no person in the house but only shee &amp; I remayninge her infant in the night tyme dyed, &amp; while I lye fast sleepeinge she secretly in to my bed her infant dead conueyed &amp; tooke away my child, &amp; yt in her owne bosome layd &amp; rysinge for to geue the child some mylke that by me lay I found yt dead, &amp; saw yt was not myne when yt was day Botilla. Yt ys not so: for thy child's dead, &amp; this is myne that's lyuinge Molina Nay thine's dead, &amp; myne lyues. Botill[a]. Beleue her not o king she lyeth K. Salomon Geue me a sworde, &amp; I will cutt the lyuinge child a sunder &amp; geue th'one halfe to th'one, &amp; th'other halfe to th'other. Molina. Hold hold your hand my gratious lord I do beseech your maiesty &amp; geue her the whole child a-lyue rather then yt should dye Botilla. Yt shall be neyther myne nor thine, but let yt be diuided. K. Salomon Shee ys the childs true mother, &amp; to her yt shall be deliuered: vnto thee take thy child molina, for briefly that's my dome People of Israel. Our lord be pray'sd who to the kinge hath geuen such great wisdome &amp; knowledge to fynde out the truth in such a difficult matter Molina Most humble thankes renowned kinge vpon my knees I render vnto your royall grace, because you haue true iustice done. K. Salomon. It was my part so for to doe. But now lett vs begone. Nuncius The iudgment of Kinge Salomon all Israel doth admyre for the wisdome of God in hym most playnly doth appeare wc h makes them all of hym afrayd. And he hath many princes who vnder hym in Israel haue both great &amp; goodly offices besydes twelue gouernours yt do serue ech one in his month yearely for the kings house in their due course. And for hym there's provided ech day floure thirty measures, Three score of meale, Ten oxen fatted &amp; twenty pasture fedde, A hundred rames, besyds the venison of harts, roes, bufles, &amp; fatt foule, for there's in his possession all the countries beyond the ryuer from Thapsa vnto Goza. And all the kings there of vnto hym subiect are: And Iuda &amp; Israel dwell wt h out all feare ech one vnder his fig tree &amp; come from Bersabee to Dan. for he's at peace &amp; vnity wt h all that round a-bout hym are. And Stales of chariott horses he fourty thousand hath: And for his saddle he possesses twelue thousand. And such wisdome god vpon hym hath bestowed that all theirs in the East, &amp; of th'Ãgiptians yt farre passed. And wyser hee ys then all men, &amp; great renowne hath gotten through all the countries round about: And parables he hath spoken Three thousand, And a thousand &amp; fyue seuerall tongues he speaketh And of trees from the cedar that's in Libanus, he disputeth vnto the very Isop that doth come out of the wall. And he discourseth of beasts, creepinge wormes, &amp; fish &amp; foule. And from all the kings of the earth, &amp; people vnto Salomon dayly resort ys made for to heare &amp; admyre his wisdome. And Salomon ys now a-bout, accordinge to the worde of god to Dauid made, to buyld a Temple to our lord. And Hiram Kinge of Tyre, who to his father ay was frend lyke frendship vnto Salomon his sonne doth still pretend as shortly shall appeare, for here they cominge are together To them geue eare &amp; you shall heare what they intend hereafter K. Salomon Hiram thou knows the house that by my father was intended for to be buylt vnto our lord, by hym was not performed because he hindred was wt h warres yt round about hym were but now our lord hath geuen me rest, &amp; none do me incounter Where fore I purpose for to buyld a Temple to the name of our lord god, syth he hath sayd that I shall buyld the same. There fore thy seruants cause some Cedre trees for to cutt downe in Libanus, for in my people there ys not any one for skill in woode lyke the Sidonians: And to thee shall be payed what s'euer shall by thee in thy seruants behalfe be asked K. Hiram Blest be our lord who geuen hath vnto Dauid a sonne so wyse his people for to guyde, &amp; sitt vpon his Throne. And cedre trees my seruants shall from Libanus downe bringe vnto what place you shall appoynt for to performe that buildinge. And for my house you shall agayne allow needful prouision K. Salomon There to I willingly consent: &amp; so let's hence be gone Nuncius Hiram the kinge of Tyre hath now accordinge to his promisse vpon Kinge Salomon bestow'd both Cedre &amp; firre trees. And twenty thousand chores of wheate Hiram agayne receiued &amp; as many chores of Barly were lyke wyse to hym deliuered &amp; twenty thousand sates of oyle, &amp; as many mo of wyne accordinge to the bargayne that betwixt them made had byne for the provision of his house: for well they do agree &amp; betwixt them ys made a perfect league of peace &amp; vnyty And thirty thousand workemen were taskt out of Israel, and ech month by course to Libanus Salomon did send ten thousand: And seuenty thousand also were vsed for burden caryers &amp; in the mountayne there were eighty thousand men stone hewers besydes three thousand &amp; six hundred who the work surveyed: And choyce stones are in the fundation of the Temple placed: and all the walls are of squar'd stones: And twenty cubits in breadth the Temple ys: Threscore in length; &amp; six score cubits in heigth. Before the face there of there's also made a porch proportionable for length &amp; breadth, &amp; windows that do beautify the Temple. Wt h seelinge made of cedre trees the Temples Topp ys couered &amp; plates of most fyne gold vnto ye same throughout are fastened. The flore ys wt h most pretious marble pau'd of wondrous beauty The beames, posts, walls &amp; dores wt h gold are couered rychly And the walls of the Temple are wt h diuerse pictures graued: as cherubs, palme trees, &amp; such lyke, where wt h the Temple's beautifyed. And in the Temple he hath made a place that called ys, Sanctum sanctorum, wc h in English ys Holy of Holyes. &amp; couer'd yt wt h plates of gold, wc h wt h gold nayles are nayled, &amp; fifty sicles euery nayle there in of pure gold weighed And th'Altar that is plac't therein wt h gold is also couered as also the two cherubs are of olyue trees composed, wc h in the oracle placed bee, &amp; wt h their wings do couer th'Arke of the couenant of our lord, the wc h ye priests brought thither from Sion Dauids citty, wt h all the furniture of the Tabernacle beinge accompanyed wt h the kinge, &amp; all the men of Israel. And nothinge in the Arke was putt but ye two tables only wc h were in Horeb vnto Moyses geuen by god almighty: And all that were before the Arke both Rammes &amp; oxen immolated So many that the victimes were mo then could well be numbred. And that while on their Instruments of musike they play'd merely &amp; wt h their voyces songe there to, &amp; praysed god Almighty &amp; presently all of them were wt h a darke cloud invironed for wt h the glory of our lord the house of god was filled. And in the house of god an Altar ys of gold erected &amp; table where on loaues of proposition still be placed And candle sticke there also are fyue vpon eyther hand made of pure gold, the wc h agaynst the Oracle do stand. And of pure gold there also be flesh hookes, Phialls, &amp; morters wt h water potts, hinges of dores, &amp; also golden snuffers. And in the fourth yeare of his raigne Salomon began this buildinge &amp; in th'eleuenth yeare he now hath made there of an endinge. And for hym selfe an other house since also hath erected in Libanus: &amp; for his wyfe an other also builded: And here he comes to geue god thankes now when his worke ys done as shall appeare yf you attentyue bee. So I'l be gone. K. Salomon. Lord god of Israel there ys not the lyke god vnto thee in heauen or earth who wt h thy seruants keepes couenant &amp; mercy. yf they thy laws obserue &amp; keepe: for thou hast all performed wc h to my father Dauid thou in former tymes hast promised. for to thy name I builded haue a house, as to my father thou sayd not hee, but his seede should. And now I make my prayer to the o lord that thyne eyes may vpon this house be fixed both day &amp; night, where in thou sayd yt thy name should be invocated. And who so euer in thy house to thee shall make petition his prayer heare o lord wt h in thy heauenly habitation. Yf any man agaynst his neiyhbour synne &amp; ready bee agaynst hym for to sweare, &amp; wt h a curse bynde hym selfe rashly before the Altar in thy house, thou shalt from heauen heare &amp; iustly as he doth deserue vnto the party render. And yf thy people shall be by their enemyes subdued &amp; penance do, &amp; be agayne truly to thee conuerted &amp; pray vnto thee in thy house, thou shalt from heauen heare &amp; them in-able all their foes for to subdue &amp; conquer. And yf the heauens be shutt vp so that no rayne do fall for the synnes of the people, &amp; they do for mercy call &amp; pardon craue, &amp; pray to thee in thy house for some rayne from heauen heare their prayers lord &amp; rayne send them agayne. yf famine, pestilence, rust, blast, locust or Brach aryse in the land of thy people, &amp; their enemyes wayst their countries, &amp; their cittie gates besige, &amp; in thy house they make their prayer from heauen heare lord, &amp; them from their plagues &amp; foes deliuer. yf any pilgrymes that in remote &amp; farre countries dwell vnto thy house repayre not beinge of thy people Israell &amp; there adore &amp; craue thy help, Lord graunt them their petition &amp; send them help from heauen, wc h ys thy firme habitation. And yf thy people shall go forth to warres agaynst their foe &amp; shall adore &amp; honour thee agaynst way as they goe where in the citty ys, &amp; the house the wc h thou hast chosen thou shalt their prayers heare, &amp; their petitions graunt from heauen. And yf thou haue them for their synnes vnto their foes deliuered (for none there ys yt synneth not) &amp; they be captyues caryed in to a country farre or neare, &amp; there returne vnto thee &amp; for their synne do penance in the land of their captiuyty &amp; thee adore agaynst the way of the citty thou hast chosen &amp; of the house that I haue buylt, thou shalt them heare from heauen, &amp; forgeue them, &amp; bringe them to the land from whence they came that all the people of the earth may feare thy holy name, &amp; know that thou the prayers of thy seruants heares beinge offered in, or towards thy holy temple, wc h I for thee haue buylded. Let these my prayers lord before thee bee both day &amp; night &amp; make vs perfectly to walke for euer in thy sight God. Thy prayer Salomon I haue heard euen from my throne in heauen &amp; the house thou hast built to me for sacrifice haue chosen. Yf heauen I shall shut, &amp; rayne fall not, or shall command plague to consume my people, or Locusts to destroy the land &amp; they conuerted shall do pennance, &amp; invocate my name theyr synne I'l pardon, &amp; no more afflict them for the same. Myne eyes shall open bee, &amp; myne eares to his prayer listen that shall pray in the house wc h I vnto my self haue chosen for I haue sanctifyed that place, that my name there may bee for euer, &amp; myne eyes &amp; heart remayne there for eternity. And yf before me thou walke as thy father Dauid did &amp; my lawes &amp; commandments keepe, &amp; do what I thee bidd I the Throne of thy kingdome will rayse vp, &amp; there shall neuer a prince of thy stocke want in Israel as I told thy father. But yf my iustices, precepts &amp; lawes you shalt forsake &amp; serue strange gods, &amp; them adore, I vtterly will take &amp; plucke you out of the land wc h I haue vnto you geuen &amp; t'house wc h thou hast buylt, &amp; I haue sanctifyed &amp; chosen I'l cast away from my face, &amp; deliuer yt for a parable &amp; to the people of all nations will make yt an example: And to all passengers a prouerbe, who as they do passe by astonished, shall say: Wherefore hath the lord done so strangly vnto this land, &amp; to this house? And they shall answeare make: Because that they the lord god of their fathers did for sake who them out of the land of Ãgypt brought, &amp; haue adored strange gods, &amp; there fore all these euills haue vnto them happened. K. Salomon. Lord I confesse yt fittinge ys that yt should so be done yf we leaue thee, &amp; serue strange gods: But now I will be gone. to Dedicate to the (o lord) the house wc h I haue buylded &amp; for to see that Sacrifice there in be duly offered. Nuncius So soone as the kinge in the Temple had his prayers ended fyre did descend from heauen &amp; his holocausts consumed &amp; wt h the maiesty of our lord the temple filled was so that for yt the priestes into the Temple could not passe &amp; all Israel the fyre did see descendinge, &amp; the glory of our lord on the house, and yt did them so much astony that fallinge flatt vpon the paued stones they all adored our lord, whose mercy lastes for aye, &amp; his name highly praysed And Salomon for hostes Twenty two thousand oxen killed &amp; Rammes an hundred twenty thousand, &amp; the house of god Dedicated. And when the queene of Saba heard how wealthy Salomon was &amp; that all other men in wysdome he did farre surpasse She came vnto Hierusalem to proue hym in hard questions &amp; wt h her brought great store of gold, &amp; spice, &amp; pretious stones. And Salomon hath all resolu'd that she to hym propounded. And when shee saw his wisdome &amp; the house that he hath buylded &amp; the meattes of his table, &amp; t'habitation of his seruants, &amp; th'offices his ministers had, wt h all their pretious garments, &amp; holocausts wc h in the house of god he dayly immolated, no spirit in her any longer was, she was so sore astonyed as you your selues shall shortly see, yf you will shew attention for here the queene wt h Salomon comes alonge: now I'l begone Queene of Saba. Kinge Salomon the fame ys true wc h I heard in my country of thy wisdome, vertue, &amp; wealth, the wc h till I did see wt h myne owne eyes, I could not creditt. But now I see right well that scarsely the one halfe there of they did vnto me tell Blessed thy men &amp; seruants are that do assist before thee &amp; at all tymes thy wisdome heare, &amp; blest thy lord god bee who hath thee placed on this throne because Israel he loueth &amp; will preserue yt euer, &amp; there fore thee on yt sett Iudgments &amp; Iustice for to do, &amp; for the loue I beare thee all the gold, spice &amp; pretious stones wc h hither I brought wt h mee on thee o kinge I do bestow, &amp; that wt h all my heart &amp; so I'l take my leaue of thee, syth I must needs depart K. Salomon. Thankes worthy queene of Saba, &amp; your kyndnes I will recompence before your company I leaue, where fore let's now go hence. Nuncius An hundred twenty Talents of gold wt h spices very rare &amp; pretious stones equall to wc h in value els where none are the queene of Saba hath vpon kinge Salomon bestowed. In recompence where of shee more of hym agayne receiued. for what shee askt he to her gaue: and backe to her owne country shee's gone admyringe much the wealth &amp; wisdome of his maiesty for his ryches &amp; glory farre all earthly kinge exceeded, so that to see his face, &amp; heare his wisdome she desyred &amp; did present hym wt h rych gyftes, as vessels, armour, spices &amp; robes &amp; garments of the fynest gold, &amp; mules, &amp; horses. And all the vessels at his table vs'd of gold were made &amp; as great store he in Hierusalem of syluer had as stones: so that as nothinge gold in that citty was esteemed &amp; cedres were as plentifull as Sicomors while he buylded. And while he serued god, &amp; vnto hym obedient was all things he tooke in hand did prosper well. But now alas growinge in yeares (for so you must suppose) wt h strangers hee agaynst the law of god ys maryed, &amp; fallen to Idolatry. for he hath wyues, as yt were queenes in number seuen hundred &amp; concubins three hundred, wc h away his heart haue turned vnto their godds &amp; goddesses from the true god of heauen for he hath buylt a Temple to th'Idol of Ammons children Moloch, &amp; to Chamos th'Idoll of Moab, &amp; vnto Astarthee Sidonians goddesse, &amp; to them geuen t'honour due to god Almighty for wt h th'Ãgiptians, Moabits, Ammonits &amp; Idumeians he maryed hath, &amp; also wt h the Hetheits, &amp; Sidonians: Wt h whom our lord forbad children of Israel for to mary lest that they should be drawne by them for to committ Idolatry: And wt h what punishment god will hym afflict for his transgression shall streight appeare yf you'l a while geue eare. So I'l begone. God. Salomon because thou hast my lawes &amp; precepts not obeyed thy kingdome I'l asunder rende, &amp; yt shall be delyuered vnto thy seruant: not wt h standinge in thy dayes I'l not do yt for Dauids sake thy father, but from thy sonne I will rende yt, although not all, for I will leaue one Tribe vnto thy sonne &amp; Hierusalem for Dauids sake, who my precepts hath done. of all the rest for thy offence he shall depryued bee K. Salomon. I'l be gone lord &amp; rest content, syth there's no other remedy. Nuncius. The generall peace wc h Salomon had all this whyle inioyed, conuerted was to cruell warres since he god disobeyed. for Adad an Idumean, &amp; Razen kinge of Damascus his enemyes did become, &amp; Hieroboam was rebellious who had his seruant bene before: &amp; to hym yt was tolde by Ahias the prophet that ten Tribes possesse he should of the kingdome of Israel when Kinge Salomon was dead yf he gods lawes &amp; precepts did obserue, &amp; his pathes treade. Wc h when Kinge Salomon heard agaynst Ieroboam he did rayse all the forces he could, &amp; made Ieroboam go his wayes towards Ãgipt vnto Kinge Sesac, where he wt h hym hath stayed vntill he heard of Salomons death, wc h now of late ys happened when fourty yeares he in Hierusalem had reigned ouer all Israell, &amp; he buryed ys in the citty of his father &amp; in his place his Sonne Roboam reignes; but in what fashion here after will apparent be in tyme so I'l be gone.</field>
