      <field name="fulltext">OLYMPIC REVELS; OR, PROMETHEUS AND PANDORA; A Mythological, Allegorical Burletta, In One Act</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not translated from the French, but borrowed from the English of George Colman, the Younger, the HEADS being taken from that gentleman's Tale of “The Sun Poker.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First performed at the Olympic Theatre, 3rd January, 1831.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following address was written at my request by John Hamilton Reynolds, and spoken by Madame Vestris on the opening night:— Noble and Gentle—Matrons—Patrons—Friends! Before you here a venturous woman bends! A warrior woman—that in strife embarks, The first of all dramatic Joan of Arcs. Cheer on the enterprise, thus dared by me! The first that ever led a company! What though, until this very hour and age, A lessee-lady never owned a stage! I'm that Belle Sauvage—only rather quieter, Like Mrs. Nelson, turned a stage proprietor! Well known to the coaching men of that day. Welcome each early and each late arriver— This is my omnibus, and I'm the driver! Sure is my venture, for all honest folk, Who love a tune, or can enjoy a joke, Will know, whene'er they have an hour of leisure, Wych-street is best to come to for their pleasure. The laughter and the lamps, with equal share, Shall make this house a light-house against care. This is our home! 'Tis yours, as well as mine; Here Joy may pay her homage at Mirth's shrine; Song, Whim, and Fancy jocund rounds shall dance, And lure for you the light Vaudeville from France. Humour and Wit encourage my intent, And Music means to help to pay my rent. 'Tis not mere promise—I appeal to facts; Henceforward judge me only by my acts! In this, my purpose, stand I not alone— All women sigh for houses of their own; And I was weary of perpetual dodging From house to house, in search of board and lodging! Faint was my heart, but, with Pandora's scope, I find in every box a lurking hope; My dancing spirits know of no decline, Here's the first tier you've ever seen of mine. Oh, my kind friends! befriend me still, as you Have in the bygone times been wont to do; Make me your ward against each ill designer, And prove Lord Chancellor to a female Minor. Cheer on my comrades, too, in their career; Some of your favourites are around me here. Give them—give me—the smiles of approbation, In this Olympic game of speculation; Still aid the petticoat on old, kind principles, And make me yet a Captain of Invincibles! Alluding to the elder Mr. Morton's farce of “The Invincibles,” in which at Covent Garden Madame Vestris had achieved a great renown.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene I. —Mount Olympus—Jupiter, Neptune, Hercules, and Plutus discovered at whist—Mercury stands behind Jupiter's seat—Hebe and Ganymede in waiting with nectar—on either side are arranged other Deities. Air and Chorus—Jupiter, &amp;c.—“Masaniello.” Jup. Come, mind your play, and cease your joking, Such whist as this I never knew; If, Neptune, thus you keep revoking, I'll charge the points I lose to you. Look sharp, and play your cards with care; Take heed, pri'thee do; The hands I hold would make a parson swear. Chorus. Look sharp, &amp;c. Jup. It's your deal, Neptune—cut the cards, you Plutus. Now, Neppy—turn up something that will suit us. A glass of nectar, Ganymede! (drinks) We're six. Nep. No, honours, were divided—four by tricks. Plu. Come, come, don't cheat us! Jup. Cheat, you stingy frump! Who wants to cheat? Now, Neptune, what's the trump? Nep. The ten of hearts. Her. Then 'tis our turn to croak; For Neptune's hearts, we know, are hearts of oak. Plu. (playing) A little diamond. Her. Diamond! Oh, you brute! Had it been clubs I could have followed suit. Nep. That's a vile pun; and Johnson used to say, Who made a pun would pick a pocket. Her. (rising, angrily) Eh? Jup. Curse you, be quiet, will you, with your tricks? (flinging down his cards) I swear by clubs—poh, stuff!—I mean, by Styx, I'll play no more; and next time, I insist, When you joke—joke; when you play whist—play whist. All. Finish the rubber. Jup. I will not; I say, Turn up the table—take the cards away. Let's have some music. Hermes, where's Apollo? Mer. Gone to the Glee-club, at the Cat and Swallow. Jup. Deuce take the fellow. Where is Bacchus now? Mer. He's at the Punch Bowl, drunk as David's sow. Jup. Where's Mars? Mer. He's gone to drill. Jup. Where's Juno, pray? Mer. She's in the laundry, sir; it's washing day. Jup. The sky's deserted. Isn't Momus there? Mer. No, sir; he's eating fire at Troy Fair. Jup. Where's Esculapius? Mer. Priam's rather queer, And he's gone down to bleed him, sir. Jup. Oh, dear! Then I'll to sleep; bid Somnus step this way. Mer. Lord, sir—he's yawning o'er the last new play. Jup. What! neither melody, wit, wine, nor slumber? Well, then, to business; ere you ten can number, Fly to Mount Etna; seek the God of Fire, Give him my compliments, and just inquire If the last thunderbolt I broke is soldered, And if he's made the lady that I ordered. Mer. (aside) Oho! for some new fair one he's an inkling. Jup. What's that you say? Mer. I fly, sir, in a twinkling. (Exit Mercury) Jup. Immortals, you have heard how one Prometheus Is making creatures out of clay beneath us; And from our kitchen range has pilfered coals, To heat their passions, and light up their souls; But I have formed a project to annoy him, Perplex, confound, and in the end destroy him. I'll feign delight at genius so uncommon, And, for reward, present him with a woman! I have directed Vulcan how to make her, And when she's finished, Mercury shall take her; She'll breed fine mischief, if she's what I think her. Re-enter Mercury. Returned—well flown! How fares the lame old tinker? Mer. Why, sir, his leg appears a little better, But for particulars, please read this letter. Jup. (taking letter by the corner, and holding it up) How dare he send me such a dirty note? He might have washed his hands before he wrote. (reads) “Vulcan's respects, regrets to make Jove wait— The thunderbolt will not be done till eight; The lady all his time has been demolishing, But she's just finished now, except the polishing; Will bring her home himself, as soon as done— Mount Etna—post meridian—half-past one.” The polishing! he works confounded slow; Zounds! I bespoke her full three weeks ago. No thunder! well, then, I must do without it Till eight, that's all that I can say about it. (Laughter and noise without) Peace there, I say—who dares make such a rout? Pray what are all my new police about? Hermes, report—who is it so uproarious? Mer. They're bringing Bacchus home, sir, very glorious. Jup. A nasty drunken dog! Enter Bacchus, supported by Pan and Silenus Two Bacchantes carrying his tub. So, sir, it's you? Bac. Your most obedient, daddy, how d'ye do? Jup. If your poor mother, Semele, were here, 'Twould break her heart to see you look so queer. For shame! you have forgotten all you owed her. Make him sit down—give him some hock and soda. Bac. Indeed, pa—I've scarce touch'd a drop of drink, And what's made me so ill I cannot think; But as to all that stuff about my mother, She took her grog as well as any other. Mer. (aside, to Jupiter) He's play'd the deuce, sir, with his best apparel; He was so drunk he could not sit his barrel. Air and Chorus—“Der Freyschutz.” Jup. Look the reeling rascal after, Yonder comes the God of Laughter, Holding both his sides—Huzza! Enter Momus. Welcome, Momus—ha, ha, ha! Chorus. —Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! ha! ha! Momus. Lo! where from the Cat and Swallow, Comes your sun and air, Apollo. Home's not “sweet home,” when he's awa, Welcome, Phœbus—ha, ha, ha! Enter Apollo, followed by Mars and Esculapius. Chorus. —Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Jup. Now we'll have fiddling and some songs between; We will, by Styx! Momus. By fiddle-sticks you mean. Jup. But here comes Vulcan, fast as he can drive. And with his handy-work, as I'm alive. Now all your voices raise, ye gods combined, To hail this paragon of womankind. Vulcan rises in the centre of the stage, with Pandora. Chorus —“Der Freyschutz.” Victoria! with shouts let Olympus be riven, A forger like Vulcan must needs be forgiven. Jove himself might believe his own deed there he saw, Victoria! Victoria! Victoria! Jup. A very clever work, indeed, son V, And as like life as any thing can be. Vul. It's not for me to sing to my own praises; And yet I may say (as the earthly phrase is) I have seen worse. Jup. Worse? I ne'er saw a better; You've followed my instructions to the letter. Vul. I did my best your wishes to fulfil; I'm glad she pleases; here's my little bill. (giving it) Jup. Your bill, sly rogue! you know the way to thrive. (reads) “To a new lass of metal—five pounds five.” My ready cash just now is all expended; I'll pay you when the thunderbolt is mended. Now all your various powers as gifts I claim, Ye Deities, to deck this dainty dame. Let Love begin, and with his subtle dart Give animation to her eyes and heart. Air—Cupid—“C'est L'Amour.” Yes, 'tis Love—'tis Love—'tis Love; His power that first imparts, Yes, 'tis Love—'tis Love—'tis Love. That hails thee Queen of hearts. (to Pandora) Jup. Now Phœbus give her tongue a gentle swing, And bid the bright belle mettle sweetly ring. Air—Apollo—“Glorious Apollo.” Glorious Apollo, every charm bestowing, Which from the melody of song can flow, When youthful souls are with soft affection glowing, Bids thee it's magic shed, o'er all below. Pan. (taking up the air) To life just awaking, My silence thus breaking, “Lisping in numbers,” all trembling I go. Air—Esculapius—“Punch cures the Gout.” I cure the gout, the colic, and the phthysic, And am known by every one, And am known by every one, To be the God of Physic. I'll give you health, my dear. Plu. I promise wealth, my dear. Bac. I'll think of something, dear, When I am sober. Venus. Lasting thy charms shall be. Momus. Mirth still shall wait on thee. Mars. I commission you, invincibly, To March from October. The usual season of the Olympic Theatre, at that period, extended from the first of October to the latter end of March. Jup. Well sung i'faith!—she blushes like Aurora, What shall her name be? Ah! I have't, Pandora. But ere to earth I send the 'witching elf, I'll sing a song, and make a gift myself. Air—Jupiter—“Count Almaviva.” Marriage of Figaro. (aside) Master Prometheus, thou compound of evil, With thy manufactures I'll soon play the Devil; You couldn't be quiet, and let folks alone, So now, master Pro., you may look to your own. (aloud to Pandora) This pretty casket, fair lady, is yours; While 'tis kept closed, it good fortune ensures. Take it with this caution,—mind, 'tis a strong one! If you open this box, you'll get in the wrong one. (aside) Master Prometheus, &amp;c. Now, Hermes, fly as fast as you are able, Saddle the swiftest cloud that's in my stable; Bear her to earth, the shortest way that you know, And—fire and fury! here comes my spouse Juno. Enter Juno. Recitative—Juno. Monster! forbear! you little thought me listening. But I have overheard this precious christening. Air—“Judy Callaghan.” But don't think me to deceive, I've caught you out again, sir; I do begin to believe, The devil's in all the men, sir. It was but Tuesday last, I granted you my pardon; But tho' your word is past, You mind it not a farden. Don't tell me; I much better than you know, For such as she (scornfully to Pandora) Jupiter's false to Juno. But I'll be revenged, I swear, Or I'm not Saturn's daughter; I'll follow her thro' the air; I'll hunt her thro' earth and water. Concealment shan't avail, I'll find her by my spies out! I'll hold you both to bail, And then—I'll scratch her eyes out! Don't tell me! I've defeated your plan again; You, Miss P., (to Pandora) Please to give me my man again. Jup. (aside) Will nothing stop that angry woman's chatter? (to Juno) My dearest Juno, you mistake the matter. The lady against whom your anger's bended, A wife for young Prometheus is intended. We've one and all been making presents to her, And I'm rejoiced you came in time to view her. Pandora,—my spouse, Juno; pray be friends, And give her something, love, to make amends. Juno. I ask your pardon, miss, if that's the case,— (aside) I hate the jade—she has such a pretty face; (aloud) And for apology my gift shall be, Woman's dear passion—Curiosity. Jup. (aside) As I could wish; now may Prometheus win her! (aloud) Farewell, Pandora; come, friends, let's to dinner. (Chorus—“Oh! the Roast Beef.”) If mortals who cannot exist upon air, Could see us at dinner, ye gods, how they'd stare; See us Hydrogin quaff, and on Oxygen fare, Singing, “Oh, the roast beef of Olympus, And O the Olympic roast beef.” (During the chorus Mercury disappears with Pandora, and the clouds close upon the Deities)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Air and Chorus—Jupiter, &amp;c.—“Masaniello.” Jup. Come, mind your play, and cease your joking, Such whist as this I never knew; If, Neptune, thus you keep revoking, I'll charge the points I lose to you. Look sharp, and play your cards with care; Take heed, pri'thee do; The hands I hold would make a parson swear. Chorus. Look sharp, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene II. —A Street on Earth. Enter Mercury and Pandora. Mer. Well, ma'am, I hope your journey has been pleasant, Pan. Couldn't be otherwise with you, sir, present. Mer. Madam, you flatter me, you make me proud. Pan. How easily one travels on a cloud! Mer. And swiftly, too, ma'am, when the wind is fair, And we'd a very favourable air. They talk of steam upon our royal mail-road, And Juno vows and swears she'll have a railroad. But come, 'tis time for us to look about, And see if we can find Prometheus out; This is the street, I think, and near the spot— But if I know the number, I'll be shot. Pan. There's some one coming—what if we ask this boy? Mer. With all my heart—he seems to be a Swiss boy. Enter Swiss Boy, with milk pails. Trio—Boy, Mercury, and Pandora—“The Swiss Boy.” Boy. Am not I, am not I, say, a big Swiss boy, Weighing hard upon twenty stone? I live free from cares, up three pair of stairs, Beside a young frau of my own. From morn till night my trade I ply, And “milk below!” I call so high. “Milk below, milk below;” still I cry as I go, “Milk below, pretty maids—milk below.” Mercury and Pandora. Prithee say—prithee say—now, my brave Swiss boy, Where Prometheus lives do you know? Boy. I were surely a flat, if I couldn't tell that; For he made me not three weeks ago. Mercury and Pandora. Then, lead us there, you can't say nay; For we have come from the milky way. Milk above! milk above, has prepared us to love. Milk below! milk below! milk below! Mer. Friend, there's strong sympathy 'twixt me and you— I skim the blue sky, you skim the sky-blue. This is— Boy. Some star, of course, sir, by her brightness? Pan. (aside) Sweet milk-boy! he's the cream of all politeness. Mer. You're right—she is a star, and hither flown, To light a little system of her own. Feeling her way—twinkling 'midst hope and doubt, You wouldn't be the man to put her out? Boy. The man who would, deserves to walk in blindness! I trust I bear the milk of human kindness. Trio—Boy, Mercury, and Pandora—“La Galopade.” Come, follow me, I'll lead you straight, Prometheus shuts up shop at eight. And if you wouldn't be too late, Why you must gallop hard. Mercury. In speed to fail I shan't begin, (stumbles over pail) But curse that pail, It's broke my shin. My legs and wings accommodate, Or I can't gallop hard. All. Come along, come along. without more debate. Prometheus shuts up shop at eight, And we shall surely be too late, Unless we gallop hard. (They dance off)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene III. —Prometheus' workshop. Prometheus discovered reading letters. “King Tereus is out of subjects sadly, Prometheus really treats him very badly, He promised him a gross without delay.” Why, zounds! he had a gross the other day; He thinks men made as easily as hay. Let's see what t'other wants—“A batch of peers, Two China courtiers, and twelve grenadiers; The grenadiers may be of delf, but higher Than the last lot, and able to stand fire. The others, as the battle's heat increases, Bounce, break, and fly into a thousand pieces.” Of course, the fool—does he expect such new men, Will stand and be shot at like Waterloo men? It isn't my fault, if they don't last longer, I've got no English stuff to make 'em stronger. But what a roaring trade I'm driving, burn me! But I can scarcely tell which way to turn me. What ho, there. Enter Servant. Lay the cloth, it's time to sup. Serv. There's Mercury below, sir. Prom. Shew him up. (Exit Servant) Enter Mercury and Pandora. Air—Mercury—“Giovinetti.” Jove in etiquette's face boldly flying, Its dictates defying, Condescends first to bid war be stayed; On your future good conduct relying, Your genius espying, He sends you this fair ready maid. Since clay you are clever at moulding, A model like this still beholding, Will surely, your talents unfolding, Soon bring to perfection your trade. Prom. Sir, your good news delights me beyond measure, I shall esteem the lady quite a treasure. Of course, you know that making men my trade is. I've got no clay that's fine enough for ladies. And at the first glance of that witching dame, I felt within my heart a raging flame, Much hotter than the one from Jove I stole; You smile, ma'am, but it's true, upon my soul. Mer. She's yours, sir, if you like her—so good bye, I must away as fast as I can fly. (Exit) Prom. Farewell—remember me to all up stairs. Now, welcome pleasure, and begone my cares, Earth will seem heaven, while we together range it. Tell me your name, that I may haste and change it. Air—Pandora—Tyrolienne—“Guillaume Tell.” My only name is Pandora—a—a—a—a, &amp;c. This morn I came from Mount Etna—a—a—a—a, &amp;c. By Jove I am sent to be, Your chère amie, and so d'ye see, I'll have you if you'll have me, Etcetera—a—a—a—a, &amp;c. My only name is Pandora—a—a—a—a, &amp;c. I've travelled far, On cloudy car,—a—a—a—a, &amp;c. I have no pa—a—a—a—a, I have no ma—a—a—a—a—a, No friend or relation To get me a situation, So have some consideration, For poor Pandora! Prom. Consideration! No, I won't consider A single moment; I'm the highest bidder Against the world. Great Jupiter's decree, And Vulcan's hammer, knocked you down to me. Thy lot of love is mine, thou rosy rogue, The greatest bargain in fate's catalogue. Pan. You'll wed me, then? Prom. Can'st doubt it? I but go To give some orders to my clerks below, And back I'll hasten, like the travelled dove, To sup on wild ducks with my dearest love. Pan. But may I trust you? You vile men betray so. Prom. Upon my honour, madam! By my say so! Duet—Prometheus and Pandora—“Rise Gentle Moon.” Prom. Ere I go down to make out a small bill—O, Promise to wed you I certainly will—O. But cookey hurries on the table to cover; Stay then, and sup on wild ducks with thy lover, Gentle maid, gentle maid, stay and sup with thy lover. Pan. While in such terms you continue to woo me, Sweeter than supper will you be unto me. Let the wild ducks still, the red cook growl over, Thou art the duck of all ducks for a lover! Gentle youth, gentle youth, thou'rt a duck of a lover! Prom. But have you not some luggage with you, dear? Pan. Only one little box—behold it here. Prom. How, nothing else? Nought coming by the carrier? (aside) Oh, what a fool I was to say I'd marry her. (aloud) Can you your wardrobe in that small trunk pack? Pan. Oh, no. My wardrobe, sir, is on my back. Prom. What? then, may be, your fortune's in that case? Pan. You're wrong again, my fortune's in my face. Prom. What! did the shabby Thunderer send you down Without a change of dress, or half-a-crown? (aside) A precious business, neither goods nor money; Confound it—I've the comb without the honey. Well, I can't help myself, so needn't try; She's taken in now—and 'gad, so am I. (aloud) Stay and amuse yourself, since here you are; If you feel heavy, there's a “light guitar.” (Exit) Pan. Alone, by Jingo! Now I'll have a peep At this same box of mine, before I sleep, Not that I'm curious—no—it isn't that, But I must have a peep, and will, that's flat. Air—Pandora—“Gentle Zitella,” Brigand. Pro's in the cellar, Out of the way; Now is the moment, The peeper to play! Too long I've lingered— So open ye locks: There can be no great harm In so small a box! Jove's a sly fellow! Loves hoaxing, I hear; In that case, from this one I've nothing to fear. Can it be lip salve? Or sweet lollipops? Pretty pearl earrings? Or peppermint drops? Things such as these In the case should there be, Jove's prohibition's All fiddle-de-dee! Jove's a sly fellow, Loves hoaxing, I hear; In that case, from this one I've nothing to fear. (speaking) Perhaps it's snuff! upon the truth I've fixed, sure! (smelling to it) It's “Lundyfoots,” I think—or “Prince's mixture.” I'm half afraid—yet wherefore should I flinch? If it be snuff, 'twill serve me at a pinch; It can but make me sneeze—egad, I'll try! If I don't see what's in it I shall die. And did Jove think me such a simple flat? Hoax me with snuff! No. no—I'm up to that. Air (resumed). Thinks he “I'll tell her Of trap to beware; Warn her of some super- Natural snare.” Ah! “sup”—I have it! I see through his fun; 'Tis Macaroni, As sure as a gun! In Vermicelli There's nothing to fear— Up goes the lid, though Old Harry were here! Now then to see the play! Oh, lucky elf, I've got a private box all to myself! Music.—Opens the box—crash without—thunder—clouds fill the stage, and Fiends of every description issue from it tumultuously. Enter Prometheus. Air—Prometheus—“Bonnie Laddie! Highland Laddie!” Here's a pretty kettle of fish, Oh, Pandora, fie, Pandora! All my earthenware they'll dish, Oh, Pandora, fie, Pandora! Would that we had never met, Oh, Pandora, fie, Pandora! I shall be in the gazette, Oh, Pandora, fie, Pandora! (Scene changes) Thunder.—Jupiter, Juno, and all the Deities appear; Prometheus and Pandora kneel. Jup. Aha! my fine man-maker, so I've caught you, And on your marrow bones for mercy brought you; And you, Miss P., I care not for your weeping; By all the powers I'll make you pay for peeping. Air—Jupiter—“Dunce I did but sham,” Midas. Since you've let out the sin, That you might have kept in, To wander and vex the world through, You must own it's but right That my vengeance should light, In the first place, ye worms, upon you. (to Pandora) To an ugly old maid, You shall dwindle and fade, In spite of your patches and paint, (to Prometheus) And to punish your flights, And the theft of my lights. You shall die of a liver complaint. (A vulture descends and fastens on the side of Prometheus) All the Deities. Oh, spare them, mighty Jove. Jup. Peace and knock under! It's eight o'clock, rogues, and I've got my thunder. Min. Hold—hold, papa, your anger please abate; Wisdom can sometimes pluck the thorns from fate. (to Pandora) Look in the box—nor to despair give scope. Pan. Heyday! what's this, pray, at the bottom? Hope rises out of the box. Hope. Hope! Air—Hope—“Hope told a Flattering Tale.” Hope bids ye not despair (to Pandora and Prometheus) Nor yield to idle grief; Tho' earth be filled with Care, 'Tis Hope that brings relief. Then your decree repeal, (to Jupiter) Nor give your anger scope; Or you yourself may feel, Too soon the loss of Hope. Jup. (to Pandora and Prometheus) You're pardon'd. Go to Mrs. Hope, and thank her; Grief disappears, wherever she casts anchor. Prom. Ay, and that grief from all may disappear, (to the Audience) Hope humbly begs she may cast anchor here. Pan. Smile, ye kind gods, on our Olympic Revels; Ye gay gallants, come, banish my blue devils, Let not my grapes be sour as the fox's, But fill with patrons all Pandora's boxes. Finale—“Think not, lewd Jove,” Midas. Pan. Ye belles and ye beaux, Who adorn our low rows Ye gods, who preside in the high ones; Ye critics, who sit All so snug in the pit,— An assemblage of clever and sly ones! Let the smile of content On our efforts be bent; Hope anxiously waits an encora; In the fate-dooming scale, Oh! let mercy prevail, And be kind to poor little Pandora. Prom. Prometheus, poor elf, Manufacturer of delf Men,—begs you'll still allow him to make 'em. Your favours impart To each crockery heart, For your anger will certainly break 'em. Jup. Even Hope must despair, If her hope be baulk'd there, Where most she implores an encora; Then follow Jove's lead, And let Hope intercede For Prometheus and little Pandora. CURTAIN.</field>
