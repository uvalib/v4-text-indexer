      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. SILENUS mounted on his Ass. SILENUS. Strange by my troth 'twould be, if the spectators, Upon their seats, don't interrupt the sport To-day; and cough, and snort, furrow their brow Groan, hiss with serpent tongue, and mutter curses. Actors and dancers beardless, in their prime, Can scarce find room upon the stage; they'll say, Why does this old lethargick go-between Appear, thus riding on an ass's back? I beg you'd hear, and give me your attention. The title of this calm, this quiet comedy I'm going to unfoldâAnd 'tis but right You should be silent, when a god commands. Who come to see, and not to bawl, unfit It is, they use the office of their tongues. Give me your vacant earsâI mean not into My handsâThose vacant ears I would my voice Should strikeâD'ye fear the stroke would give more pain Which opes the ears, than that which shuts the mouth? You're very kind indeedâYour merit claims The blessing of the godsâYour silence is ProfoundâThe very children hold their tongues. Attend to him who tells you this new tale. In a few words, both who I am, and why I come, I will disclose; and what our comedy Is call'dâI'll tell you what you wish to hear, Therefore attendâI'm one of nature's gods, The foster father of the mighty Bromius, Who victories with a female army gain'dâ Of all his great exploits which fame applauds, Many there were by my advice accomplished. Whate'er I like, he does not disapprove. 'Tis right a father should a father please. Ass-carried god Ionian actors call me, Because I'm old, and ride astride an ass. Now, who I am you knowâAnd since you know, Let me disclose the title of our comedy, And then, you'll know why I am hither come. Philemon gave it to the stage in Greek; They who speak Greek call it Evantides. Plautus in Latin calls it Bacchidesâ No wonder I appear to-day before you, Bacchus has sent you Bacchides; who are True Bacchanalian Bacchants; and I've brought them. What! have I told a fib?âIt don't become A god to lye; therefore I'll tell the truth. I brought them notâMy ass with weary pace Brings three, if I remember rightly: one You see.âBut, look what in my mouth I bring, Two Samian sisters, Bacchanalians both, Of the same parents, at the same hour born: They're twins by birth, and buxom merry jades, Not less alike than milk to milk, if you Compare them; or than water is to waterâ You'd think them halv'd should you but see them once, So strangely would your eyesight be confus'd, You never could distinguish one from th'other. Now what remains you long to hearâThen silence, While I unfold the story of the comedy. What country Samos is, is known to all; Whose seas, whose lands, whose mountains, and whose islands Your legions have made easy of accessâ There, at one labour, to Pyrgoteles Her husband, Sostrata twin daughters bore. Bacchus' triennial mysteries were then Performing: they, partaking of them, made As men are wont, the season ominous, And to each daughter gave the name of Bacchisâ The one, a captain carried into Creteâ The other sail'd away to AthensâThis Mnesilochus, the son of Nicobulus, No sooner saw than lov'd; in the interim He made her visitsâDuring this interval His father sent the youth to Ephesus, To bring the gold he had deposited. Some time before, with Archidemides An ancient friend of his, an old PhÅnician. When he had liv'd two years at Ephesus, The cruel news had reach'd his ears, that Bacchis Had quitted AthensâSailors, whom he knew, Brought the unpleasing newsâTo Pistoclerus, Philoxenus's son, his bosom friend, He wrote, with th'utmost care and diligence To search for, and find out his fugitive. While Pistoclerus labour'd for his friend, The twins, who had to Athens just return'd, Rais'd in the enquirer's breast the flame of love. The one, by her allurements, gain'd his heart, The other staid in waiting for Mnesilochus. No wonder, these engaging twins, these bacchants, With all their beauty and their soothing arts, Two youthful Bacchanalians should attract; Since both their fathers bow'd with weight of years, Decrepit, quite worn out, they could ensnare. See! Pistoclerus is returning back To the twin sisters he has lately found, And blows the sparks of love, new kindled in His breastâNow I go inâBe you attentiveâ</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter PISTOCLERUS and LYDUS. PISTOCLERUS. Ye gods! how feel I what I feel!âWhat is it?â I know not, I'm in such a flutterâYet I'm standing stillâHere is no fire, but I Am in a flameâWhat am I but a ship In danger of the rocks and shoals of love? Can the land wreck, and dash a man to pieces?â Bacchis and land I've only touch'd to-day.â If Bacchis is a berry, she's a rough one. Men formerly, 'tis said, rose from the earthâ Would the earth wreck the children of her womb? Whence this misfortune then? And am I shipwreck'd By Bacchis, or by land?â Lyd. [apart.] This man's in loveâ I see it plain; and therefore the piazza's, The temples, forums, theatres, and all The brothels, night-cellars, and stews has search'd With such a prying curiosityâ Pis. I'm shipwreck'd I confess.âBacchis it is, Not Neptune, who my little bark has toss'd; Has tumbled, broke, and dash'd it all in pieces. Lyd. Bacchis has rais'd the stormâ'Tis over with usâ We've lost our courseâ Pis. I'll to the rock whereon We split, and wreck my fortune and my youth. Uncertain is the lot of thingsâThe fates As they list govern menâWhile I, my friend Mnesilochus, assisted with my care, I found his mistress out, where he may ruin His fortune and himselfâAt the same place Perdition to myself, estate and youth I foundâSince 'tis the pleasure of the god Of love, I'm youngâTo indulge myself at some Expence, is better now, than in old age. I hold it for a maxim of wise men, What Lydus blames, if Venus, or the god Of wine, or any sensual god, a youth Contemns, he either is a fool, or will Become a lover, when his hairs are grey. I'll to the rock where I was lostâMy father May now collect the fragmentsâFollow Lydusâ I the twin sisters see, my Bacchides. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter first and second BACCHIS. 1. Bac. Won't it be better I should speak, and you Should hold your tongue?â 2. Bac. With all my heart. 1. Bac. And when My memory fails, do you assist me. 2. Bac. 'Troth I'm more afraid I shall forget, than you. I never shall remember to remind you. 1. Bac. E'en as I fear the little nightingale Will lose her songâFollow this way. Enter PISTOCLERUS. Pis. What are These courtezans, these name-sake sisters, doing? What consultation are you now upon? 1. Bac. [to 2. Bac.] Why, good.â Pis. That don't belong to your profession. 1. Bac. No being's more unhappy than a woman. Pis. What is there that you think deserves it more? 1. Bac. My sister has been praying me, that I Would search some patron out, to be her guard Against this captain, and would bring her home When she has serv'd her time.âAnd now I beg Your patronage. Pis. My patronage?âFor what? 1. Bac. That, when her time's expir'd, she may return, Lest he, the captain, keep her for his maid. Had she wherewith to pay him back his money, She would with all her heart. Pis. Where is this man? 1. Bac. I now expect him here.âBut this affair You'll best transact with us.âSit here, and wait His comingâTake with me a chearful glass, And after, I'll indulge you with a kiss. Pis. Your coaxing is meer birdlime. 1. Bac. How is that? Pis. Because I find, two aim at one poor dove. Undone! [aside] My feathers brush the limed reed. I'm sure such wanton doings suit not me. [To her.] 1. Bac. Marry! Why not? Pis. Bacchis, because I fear, A Bacchant, and your Bacchanal. 1. Bac. What is it You fear?âThe bed won't make you naughty with me. Pis. Your fondness 'tis, more than your bed I fear. You're a sly serpentâSuch a dark retreat Suits not my youth. 1. Bac. If at my house you'd play The fool, I would prohibit you myself. But when the Captain comes, I wish you here, Because before your face, no man will dare To injure her or meâThat you'll prevent, And also serve your friendâBesides, he will, When he arrives, suspect that I'm your mistress. Prithee, why thus struck dumb? Pis. Because, these things Are pretty in the talking ofâBut use them, And put them to the proof, with stings they're arm'd Which our fair deeds, our fame and fortune wound, And pierce our very soulsâAway! away! 1. Bac. Ah! you're too savage. Pis. That is for my interest. 2. Bac. You must be tam'dâAnd what do you fear from her? Pis. What fear I?âIn the hey-day of my blood To enter one of these academies Where people toil and sweat for their undoing; I my own ruin for a quoit shall toss; My running will be my disgrace and shame. 1. Bac. This is sheer wit. Pis. They'll give me, for a sword, A turtle dove to play withâAnd another, 'Stead of the manly cestus, in my hands Will put a cup, and a capacious bowl Will be my helmet, while upon my head, The festive rose, and not a plume will nod; A die will be my spear; my coat of mail A soft voluptuous cloak, my steed a couchâ And I, when I should grasp a shield, shall find A strumpet in my armsâAway! away!â 1. Bac. Ah! you're too savage!â Pis. That is for my interest. 1. Bac. You must be tam'dâI'll undertake the task. Pis. Alas! you'll be a mistress too expensive. 1. Bac. But seem to love me. Pis. Must I be in jest? And only seem? or love you in good earnest? 1. Bac. O fye!âIn earnest to be sureâAnd when The captain comes, I wish you would embrace me. Pis. What need of that? 1. Bac. What need?âThat he may see you. I know well what I doâ Pis. I, what I fearâ But what d'you say? 1. Bac. Why, what's the matter now? Pis. Why then suppose you on a sudden have A dinner, or a drinking-bout, or else Perhaps a supper, not uncommon things In such assemblies, where shall be my place? 1. Bac. By me, my lifeâWe wits will sit together. Come when you will, you'll always find good room. If you with elegance would be receiv'd, But only say, give me good cheer, my rose, For your reception, I'll provide a place, Where to your heart's content you may indulgeâ Pis. Here is a rapid stream; 'tis hazardous To pass this wayâ 1. Bac. You something in the stream Must loseâCome, give your hand, and follow me. Pis. Away!âBy no means. 1. Bac. Why not?â Pis. Nothing can Be more bewitching, than night, women, wine, To one of my warm blood. 1. Bac. Why leave me thenâ Whate'er I've done, 'twas all to pleasure you. E'en let the captain take my sister off, And be you absent, if you like it best. Pis. And am I not a thing of nothing, who Cannot my passions rule. 1. Bac. What is't you fear? Pis. NothingâI now resign myself to you. I'm wholly at your service.â 1. Bac. You're a charmer.â Now this I wish you'd doâThis very day, To welcome her return, I mean to give A sumptuous entertainment to my sister. Be you our catererâProvide a good And splendid treat. The money I will order To be brought to youâ Pis. NoâI'll bear the expenceâ 'Twould be a shame, that you on my account, Meerly to favour me, should for that favour Spend your own money. 1. Bac. NoâI cannot suffer you To pay. Pis. Pray give me leaveâ 1. Bac. I must consent, If 'tis your pleasureâPrithee then, make haste. Pis. I shall return before my love-fit's over. [Exit Pistoclerus. 2. Bac. You'll entertain me well on my return. 1. Bac. Prithee, how so? 2. Bac. Because I think you've had A lucky haul to-day. 1. Bac. He's mine for certain. Now, sister, with Mnesilochus I'll try To forward your affair, that you at home May rather fill your purse, than troop off hence With that same captainâ 2. Bac. That's my wish. 1. Bac. I'll do My bestâThe water's warmâCome, let's go in That you may batheâYour voyage has no doubt Disordered you. 2. Bac. Why yes, a little, sister. Besides, here's some one coming, who I know not, That makes a bustleâLet's begone, my sister. 1. Bac. Follow me in, that you may take some rest. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Re-enter PISTOCLERUS, with provision for the entertainment, followed by LYDUS. Lyd. I've, Pistoclerus, follow'd you some time In silence, and observ'd what you're about In this new dressâAnd may the gods so love me! As I believe Lycurgus might be here Debauch'dâAnd whither now with such a train? Pis. Why to this placeâ Lyd. Why thither? Who is't lives there? Pis. Love, pleasure, Venus, beauty, joy and sport, Jesting, with conversation, and sweet kissing. Lyd. How now!âWhat intercourse have you with these Destructive gods? Pis. Bad are the men who dare Speak evil of the goodâBut you don't spare The godsâYou are unjustâ Lyd. Is then sweet kissing Rank'd 'mongst the gods?â Pis. Do you not think she is? You're a barbarian, Lydus, whom I thought Wiser than ThalesâGo, you're more an ideot Than Rome's Potitius; you don't even know, At your great age, the names of all the gods. Lyd. Your dress offends meâ Pis. 'Twas not bought for you. 'Twas bought for me; and I'm delighted with it. Lyd. And do you make such repartees to me? Had you ten tongues, you should restrain them all. Pis. Not every stage of life is fit for schoolâ I'm thinking, Lydus, now of something else; How these provisions may be nicely dress'd, As their magnificence deservesâ Lyd. You've now Undone yourself and meâMy labour's lost, And all my good instruction's giv'n in vain. Pis. My labour's lost in the same place with yours. By your instructions, neither you nor I Have profitedâ Lyd. O! you are fascinatedâ Pis. And you are troublesomeâSo, hold your tongue, And, Lydus, follow me. Lyd. Observe that, pray. [to the spectators. He does not call me leader now, but Lydus. Pis. When I am here with other guests at table, And sitting by my love and kissing her, Perhaps, 'tis most improper and unfit To have my leader in our company. Lyd. Are these provisions for such doings, pray? Pis. Such is my wishâTh'event I leave to heaven. Lyd. And will you have a mistress?â Pis. When you see, You'll knowâ Lyd. You shan'tâI will not suffer itâ I'm going homeâ Pis. Stay Lydus, and beware A mischiefâ Lyd. What is that?âBeware a mischief! Pis. I'm grown too old for your tuition now. Lyd. Where shall I find a gulf to swallow me? O how much more I see than I would see, And how much better to have died than live! A pupil thus to threaten me his governor! No more hot blooded fiery boys for meâ Vigour to attack worn out and feeble age. Pis. In my opinion, I am Hercules, And Linus youâ Lyd. I'm more afraid by these Your shameless deeds, I shall be PhÅnix soon; And bring your father tidings of your death. Pis. Enough of historyâ Lyd. This boy is lost [aside.] To shameâWhere'er you got the impudence, 'Twas not an acquisition to be wish'd for At your green ageâHe's ruin'd past redemption. Do you ne'er once reflect you have a father? [to him. Pis. Are you my servant then, or am I yours? Lyd. These are the lessons of a wicked master, Not mineâAnd you have made a rapid progress. It was not so when I instructed you, And threw away my labour and my time. Pis. You've hitherto had liberty of speech, And prate enoughâFollow me this way then, And hold your tongue. Lyd. 'Twas an unhappy piece Of craft, these vile debaucheries to conceal, Both from your father and from me, your governor. [Exeunt. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter CHRYSALUS. CHRYSALUS. All hail! my master's native soil! whom I, After a tedious two years absence hence At Ephesus, most joyfully behold.â To thee who dwellest near our town, all hail! To thee, Apollo, to thy deity I make my prayer, that I may'nt chance to meet Old Nicobulus here, before I see My master's friend and crony Pistoclerus; To whom, about his flame, this Bacchis here, Mnesilochus, his friend has sent a letter. SCENE II. Enter PISTOCLERUS. Pis. [to 1 Bacchis within.] 'Tis strange you should request me to return So pressinglyâI can't stir from you if I would, you have me so engag'd, so chain'd By loveâ Chry. Immortal gods! here's Pistoclerusâ Hail to you, Pistoclerus. Pis. Hail to Chrysalus! Chry. I'll save you many speeches, Pistoclerusâ You're glad I'm safe arriv'd, I know you are. You promise me a lodging and a supper, To welcome my returnâI nod assent. I bring you from your friend sincere respects. Ask you me where he is? Pis. Lives he, and is He well? Chry. That question I must ask of you. Pis. How should I know? Chry. None betterâ Pis. And how so? Chry. For if his love is found, he is alive, And wellâIf not, he's sick, and near his end. A mistress is a lover's life and soulâ He's a meer nothing when she is awayâ And if she's with him, his estate will be As meer a nothing just, and he himself An inconsiderate wretchâWhat have you done In our affair?â Pis. What!âShall I not perform 'Gainst his return his orders, sent me by His messenger?âI'd sooner dwell upon The banks of Acheruns. Chry. Pray you, have you then Found out this Bacchis? Pis. Yes, the Samian Bacchis. Chry. Prithee take care you handle her with caution. You know how brittle Samian vessels areâ Pis. What! at your old sport?â Chry. Say, where is she now? Pis. Here, at this house, from whence you saw me come. Chry. Nice that indeedâShe lives almost next door. And talks she of Mnesilochus? Pis. D'you ask? Nay, he's her man of men, the only man She prizesâ Chry. Excellent! Pis. Nay, she's as much Distress'd for him, as he for herâ Chry. That's good. Pis. Nay, Chrysalus, look here, there's not so small A point of time as this, she e'er omits To talk of himâ Chry. So much the better, Bacchisâ Pis. Nayâ Chry. Nay! By Hercules! I'll get me goneâ Pis. Goes it against the grain, to hear how well Your master's business has succeeded?â Chry. Noâ 'Tis the relator gives me such offenceâ Tho' as myself I love Epidicus, No Play disgusts me more, when Pellio acts The partâIs Bacchis handsome? Pis. Do you ask? Had I not got a Venus, I should say She is a Juno.â Chry. Well, Mnesilochus, As things go on, I find here's for your love A mistress readyâAnd for this your mistress Some money must be hadâYou want some gold? Pis. Some PhilippÃ¦ansâ Chry. And you want it now, Perhaps? Pis. Ay, and beforeâFor there's a Captain coming. Chry. A Captain truly! Pis. YesâOne who demands A sum of money to relinquish Bacchis. Chry. So he delays me not, why let him come Whene'er he willâThe money is at homeâ I fear him notâNor will I ever sue To any man, while my own heart is arm'd With treacheryâI'll manage hereâGo inâ And say, Mnesilochus will soon see Bacchisâ Pis. I will. [Exit Pis. Chry. As to the money business, that Belongs to meâFrom Ephesus we've brought Twelve hundred golden PhilippÃ¦ansâAll, A debt to our old master from his host. Hence a contrivance I'll contrive to-day, How to procure some money for my masterâ But our door creeksâWho's this is coming out? SCENE III. Enter NICOBULUS. Nic. To the PirÃ¦us will I go, and see If any merchant-man's arriv'd in port, From EphesusâMy mind misgives me sore, My son has loiter'd there so long, and not Return'dâ Chry. I'll pick to pieces this old chap, An't please the gods! now fairly thread by threadâ Money is wanting. Chrysalus, no sleepingâ I'll go to him, whom I intend to make Phrixus's ram to-dayâFor of his gold I'll shear him to the quickâThe servant Chrysalus Greets Nicobulusâ Nic. O immortal gods! Where is my son?âSay Chrysalus. Chry. Why don't you Return my salutation first? Nic. Well! Save you! But where's Mnesilochus? Chry. He is alive, And wellâ Nic. Is he not come? Chry. He isâ Nic. Huzza! My mind's at easeâHas he enjoy'd good health? Chry. Robust and vigorous.â Nic. But as to the affair I sent him hence to Ephesus aboutâ Has he receiv'd the gold of Archidemides, My host? Chry. Alas! my very heart and brain Are cleft, whene'er I hear that fellow nam'd. Ah! do not call your enemy your host. Nic. Why so, I pray? Chry. Because, I'm very sure Four gods, the sun, the fire, the moon, the day, Have never shone upon a viler rascalâ Nic. Than Archidemidesâ Chry. Why, yes I say, Than Archidemidesâ Nic. What has he done? Chry. What has he not done?âWhy not ask you that? At first he boggled with your son, and then Declar'd he ow'd you not a single groatâ Mnesilochus then summon'd instantly Our antient host, old PelagoâIn his presence Your son produc'd the token you had sent By him, to give to Archidemides. Nic. Well, when he shew'd the tokenâ Chry. He began To say 'twas counterfeit, and not that token. Oh! how did he abuse the innocent! And said, he had counterfeited other things. Nic. Has he the gold?âThat's what I first would know. Chry. Well, as the PrÃ¦tor had appointed delegates, He at the last was castâAnd being compell'd By force, paid down twelve hundred PhilippÃ¦ans. Nic. Just what he ow'dâ Chry. Further; now hear besides Another stratagem he had prepar'dâ Nic. Is there aught else? Chry. Mind yeâThere will be three In allâ Nic. I am deceiv'dâI have intrusted To an Autolycus, a thievish host, My goldâ Chry. Nay, hear me butâ Nic. I never knew The greedy disposition of my hostâ Chry. Well, when the money we had receiv'd, desirous To be at home, we went on board a ship. As I by chance was sitting on the deck, And prying round about, I spy'd a bark, A long one, well mann'd too, and fitted out It seem'd to no good purposeâ Nic. I'm undone! This bark goes to my heartâ Chry. The vessel was Between some pirates, and your host in partnership. Nic. How could I such an ideot be, to trust This fellow, when his very name cry'd out That Archidemides would be arch enough To keep my moneyâ Chry. For our ship, this bark Was watchingâI began to watch their motions. Mean time, out of the port we sail'd, which when We'd clear'd, they instant follow'd with their oars Swift as the swallow, or the swifter winds. Now as I found what scheme they were upon, We drop'd our anchorâWhen they saw us stop They mov'd their vessel round and round in port. Nic. The wicked wretches!âWell, what did you then? Chry. Back we return'd to port. Nic. 'Twas wisely done. And how behav'd they afterwards? Chry. They went On shore towards nightâ Nic. Ay, ay, to seize the gold, Was their intentâThat was their scheme, by Hercules! Chry. Ay, I discern'd it; I was not deceiv'd, And therefore terrified almost to deathâ When for the gold we found a plot was laid, We held immediately a council on it; And publickly, next day before their faces, That they might see it done, bore off the goldâ Nic. Well done, by Hercules! Say then, what did they? Chry. Crest fallen quite, when with the gold they saw us Leaving the harbour, strait they shook their heads, And haul'd their bark on shoreâThe gold, we with Theotimus deposited, a priest Of the Ephesian Dian. Nic. And who is That same Theotimus?â Chry. An eunuch priest Who lives at Ephesus, and to the Ephesians A man most dearâ Nic. By Hercules! I wish He turn not out a man more dear to me; If he should cozen me of such a sum. Chry. 'Tis in Diana's temple safely stow'd. There is a publick guardâ Nic. That hurts me sorely. 'Twould have been safer here in private keeping, But have you brought none of the money home? Chry. Yes sure.âHow much he brought, I do not know! Nic. How's thatâNot know! Chry. Why 'tis, because my master Went to Theotimus at night by stealthâ And neither me, nor any of the crew Would with the secret trustâAnd that's the cause I do not know how little 'twas he brought. But 'twas not muchâ Nic. D'you think that it was half? Chry. In troth I know not; but think scarce so much. Nic. Was it a third? Chry. I don't conceive it wasâ But in good truth I do not knowâAnd troth, The whole about the money that I know, Is only this, I nothing know about it. Now you must take a voyage then by sea, And fetch the gold home from Theotimus. And, hark yeâ Nic. What would'st have? Chry. Do not forget To carry your son's ringâ Nic. What need of that? Chry. Because it is the token; and who brings it Will from Theotimus receive the gold. Nic. I'll not forget itâYou advise me well. But is Theotimus a man of property? Chry. What! ask you that?âHis shoes are elasp'd with goldâ Nic. And why so proud?â Chry. His wealth is so immense, He cannot find out ways and means, to spend it. Nic. Would he would give it me!âBut in whose presence Was it deliver'd to Theotimus? Chry. In presence of the peopleâNot a man In Ephesus but knew itâ Nic. There at least My son was wise, thus to intrust my gold To the safe keeping of a man so rich. From him it may be had upon demand. Chry. Yes, yes, look hereâHe'll not delay you thisâ You may the very day you come receive it. Nic. I thought I had escap'd the sea for life, And, as I'm now grown old, I should have sail'd No moreâWhether I will or no, I find I must, my pretty Archidemides. 'Tis my fine host, has done me this good turn. But where is now my son Mnesilochus? Chry. Gone to the Forum, his devoirs to pay Both to the gods and to his friendsâ Nic. And I'll Go hence, and meet him with what speed I may. [Exit. Chry. The man's well loaded, and besides has got More than his burdenâMy work's in the loom, In order to enrich my master's son. The lover I have manag'd so, that he Just what he pleases of the gold may take, And to his father what he will, return. Th'old man, to fetch the gold, will sail to Ephesus. We, in the interim shall live deliciously. For he will leave Mnesilochus and me BehindâO, what a racket shall I make here! But what will be the case, when our old man Discovers this, and finds he has been sent Upon a wild-goose chace?âand that we've fool'd Away his gold?âWhat will become of me When he returns?âI think he'll change my name, And make it more like gallows than like gold. Should it my purpose answer best, by Hercules! I'll run awayâShould I be caught again, He yet will suffer not a little by it. His rods are in the fields, my back's at home. Well, I'll now inâLay open to my master This plot about the goldâAnd then inform him His mistress Bacchis is discoveredâ Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter LYDUS from BACCHIS's house. LYDUS. Quick, open, open wide this gate of hell; For I in truth can count it nothing less. No one comes here, but who has lost all hope Of being goodâBacchises! No! Not Bacchises, But Bacchants perilousâAvaunt! these sisters, Who swallow human blood! The house is richly, And plentifully furnish'dâfor destruction. I took directly to my heels, as soon As I beheld these thingsâShall I conceal Such doings?âPistoclerus, shall I hide, Hide from your father, these your idle haunts, Flagitious crimes, debaucheries and ruin? On shame, disgrace, and ruin you would run, And wreck us all, yourself, your father, me, And all your friends at onceâYou have no awe Within your breast or of yourself, or me. For these misdeeds, your father, I, your friends, Relations all, by this your infamy, Must bear the weight and burthen of disgrace. Now, ere you add this mischief to the rest, I am determin'd strait to tell your father; So from myself shall I remove the blame. I'll to the old man open this affair, That he may fetch him from this mud and dirt. [Exit Lydus. SCENE II. Enter MNESILOCHUS. Mne. I've turn'd it in my thoughts in various shapes, And this is the resultâA friend who is A friend, such as the name imports, the gods Except, nothing excellsâAnd this in fact Have I experienc'dâFor when I went hence To Ephesus, almost two years ago, From thence I letters hither sent express To my old friend and crony, Pistoclerus, Desiring him to find out my dear Bacchis. I understand he has discover'd her, As Chrysalus, my slave, has just now told me. He too, against my father, for the gold A clean device has schem'd; that I, a lover, May plenty haveâ'Tis just to make return. By Pollux! nothing is, in my opinion, So vile and base as an ungrateful man. Better it is to let a thief escape, Than that a generous friend should be forsaken. And better 'tis to be extravagant, Than call'd ungratefulâThat good men will praise, The latter, even bad men will condemn. On this account must I take greater heed; And be the more upon my guardâNow, now, Mnesilochus, a sample will be seen; A proof will soon appear, whether you are Or are not what you ought to beâOr good, Or badâWhat kind you're of, or just, or unjustâ Penurious, or liberalâComplying, Or not complyingâSee you suffer not A slave to conquer you in doing well. Be what you will, I warn you, 'twill be known. But see, my crony's master and his father Are coming hitherâHence, I will observe What 'tis they are aboutâ [retires apart. SCENE III. Enter LYDUS and PHILOXENUS. Lyd. Now will I try If you have any spirit of resentmentâ Follow meâ Phil. Whither?âWhere do you lead me now? Lyd. To her who has undone, who has destroy'd Your only sonâ Phil. Lydus, fie! fie! Those who Their passion moderate, are deem'd the wiserâ Less strange it is, that age should do such things Than notâI did the same when I was young. Lyd. Alack! alack-aday!âTo his destruction You humour himâHad it not been for you, I should have had him well inclin'd to virtue. Relying now on you, and your indulgence Your Pistoclerus is become abandon'd. Mne. [aside.] Good gods!âHe names my friendâWhat can this mean? Why does he rail at Pistoclerus thus?â Phil. Lydus, it is not for a length of time A youth desires to indulge his inclinations. The hour is near when he will hate himself. Give him the reins:âso he takes care, against The rule of right and wrong not to offend, E'en suffer himâ Lyd. I will not suffer himâ Nor shall he be corrupted while I live. But you, who plead thus for your son's debaucheries So well, was this your custom in your youth? For your first twenty years, I do assert You had not liberty to set your foot A finger's breadth abroad, and your attendant AbsentâAnd had you not, before the sun Was up, attended the academy, You would have suffer'd condign punishment. When that's the case, the mischief is not singleâ The tutor and the pupil, both will lose Their charactersâThe course, the ball, the pike, The quoitâIn boxing, dancing, wrestlingâThese These were their exercises; and not wenching, And kissing girlsâIn these they spent their time, And not in secret lurking holes and corners. When from the course and place of exercise, You home return'd, girt with your narrow belt, Down by your tutor on a form you sat, And read your bookâAnd had you miss'd a syllable, Your skin had had as many spots upon it, As had your nurse's robeâ Mne. [aside.] I'm vex'd at heart, My friend, on my account, should be ill spoke of; And, for my sake, a man quite innocent, Should be suspectedâ Phil. Lydus, now our manners Are alter'd quiteâ Lyd. Full well, I know they are. The time has been, sir, when they did obey Their governors, till such time they were chosen Into some publick office in the state. Scarce seven years old, but touch them with your hand, The brat even in the instant, with his tablet Breaks his attendant's headâWhen to complain You go, what says the father?âThisâ Be thou my n'own dear boy, since thou can'st thus An injury repelâTh'attendant's call'dâ So ho! old good for nought!âon this account Touch not my boy, since he in this has shewn So stout a heartâAway I say, be gone! The tutor sneaks away despis'd, and like An oil'd cloth lantern, with his plaister'd pate Goes off condemn'dâHow can a tutor then, By means like these, keep his authority, When he himself receives the lash?â Mne. [apart.] In troth This accusation is severeâBy what This Lydus says, if he has never felt The weight of Pistoclerus' fist, 'tis strangeâ Phil. Who's this I see, standing before the door? Lyd. Philoxenusâ [addressing himself to him. Mne. [apart.] I'd rather be by gods Propitious seen, than himâ Phil. Who is that, there? Lyd. 'Tis your son Pistoclerus' friend and crony Mnesilochus; but of a different turn From him who lives in brothelsâNicobulus, O happy man, who such a son begot!â Phil. Mnesilochus, all hail!âI joy to see you Return'd in safetyâ Mne. Heavens bless Philoxenus! Lyd. He for his father in a lucky hour Was bornâHe braves the sea; regards The family estate, the house takes care ofâ With all his father's humours he complies, And his commands obeysâOur Pistoclerus And he have from their boyish years been cronies. There is not three days difference in their age; But in their manners, more than thirty years.â Phil. Beware a mischief, and restrain your tongueâ Lyd. Peace! you're a foolâIt is not that I fear. Whose deeds are ill, should ill be spoken of. For my misfortunes, I had rather he Would draw on me, than for my propertyâ Phil. How so? Lyd. Because he'd daily make them less. Mne. Why, Lydus, do you chide my friend, your pupil? Lyd. Your friend is lost to youâ Mne. Pray, heaven forbid! Lyd. 'Tis as I sayâI saw it with my eyes. Mne. What has he done! Lyd. He passionately doats on A wanton strumpetâ Mne. Won't you hold your tongue? Lyd. She's one, that ruins whomsoe'er she touchesâ Mne. Where does she live? Lyd. Why hereâ Mne. Whence do they say She comes? Lyd. From Samosâ Mne. What's her name? Lyd. 'Tis Bacchis. Mne. Lydus, you do mistakeâThe whole affair I know, and how it isâMy Pistoclerus Is innocent, and falsely you accuse himâ The orders of his true and faithful friend With diligence and care he has perform'dâ He's not in loveâDo not believe he is. Lyd. To execute the orders of his friend Was this the way?âTo set upon his lap A girl to kiss him?âBy no other means, Could these his orders be obey'd by him, But ever and anon to lay his hand Upon her breast; and without intermission Join lip to lip?âThat which I saw him do Before my face, I am asham'd to sayâ But he's asham'd of nothingâSir, in few, You have your friend, and I my pupil lostâ Philoxenus has also lost his sonâ For him I reckon lost, who's lost to shame. To say no more, had I staid somewhat longer, An opportunity more fair had offer'd Of viewing himâAnd sure, I then had seen More than was fitâMore than I ought to see, Or he to doâ Mne. [aside.] My friend, thou hast undone me. Shall I not brain this jade?âAnd may I perish, If I don't do'tâIs't come to this? One knows not Whom to confide in, where to find a man Of faith and truthâ Lyd. Observe, how ill he bears To hear his friend your son is so debauch'dâ It grieves his very soulâ Phil. Let me intreat you, Mnesilochus, his disposition guide, His passions regulateâTo me, a son, And to yourself a friend preserveâ Mne. I wish it. Phil. The whole then of this burthen I assign To youâFollow me this wayâ[to Lydus.] Lyd. Sir, I followâ But you had better leave me too behind. Phil. [to Lydus.] Enough in conscienceâWatch and rate him soundly. [to Mnesilochus.] For you, and me, and all his friends, Mnesilochus, He, by his shameful deeds, has brought to shame. [Exeunt Philoxenus and Lydus. SCENE IV. MNESILOCHUS alone. Mne. And now, whether my mistress, or my crony Is most my friend, as yet I am in doubt. Is he her choice?â'Tis best to let her have himâ To her own loss it is, as well as mine, That she has acted thusâWith holy things Let me be never trusted, if I make not A manifest exampleâFor I love herâ She shall not say, that she has found a man To make a fool ofâNow will I go home, And try to pilfer something from my father; And, as a present give it herâI'll be In many ways reveng'dâAnd to such straits I'll drive her so extremely, that my father Shall beg an almsâBut am I in my wits, Who in this manner prate of things to come? 'Tis my opinion, I'm in love; because I know I amâBut I had rather be The poorest beggar in the streets, than she Should be the filing of a pin the heavier For ought that I shall give herâNever, while She lives, shall she make me her laughing-stockâ Now, the whole money I'm resolv'd to pay My fatherâUpon me then pennyless And needy shall she fawnâBut thence, no more Advantage shall she ever reap, than if A dead man in his tomb, she with her jokes Would entertainâI will be sooner starv'd To death, than she shall ever be a whit More pursy, or more fat, for any wealth Of mineâ'Tis fix'd the money to restoreâ At the same time, my father I'll intreat To spare poor Chrysalus, on my account, And not be angry for the gold, which he Has trick'd him ofâHis interest to consult It is but right, who meerly for my sake The fraud inventedâDo you follow meâ[to an attendant.] [Exit Mnesilochus. SCENE V. Enter PISTOCLERUS, from BACCHIS's house. Pist. All other business, Bacchis, I postpone, [speaking to her as he comes out. Your orders to obey; that I may find Mnesilochus, and bring him with me hitherâ But if my messenger's arriv'd, I wonder What 'tis delays himâI'll go in and see, If he's by chance at homeâ SCENE VI. Enter MNESILOCHUS at some distance. Mne. Soâall the money I've paid back to my fatherâNow I'm pennyless, I should be glad to meet this scornful girl. How hard it was to gain for Chrysalus A pardon from my fatherâBut at length I have succeeded, and his passion's calm'd. Pist. And is not this my friend? [apart.] Mne. And is not this [apart.] My foe, I see? Pist. I'm sure 'tis heâ Mne. 'Tis he. Pist. I'll go up to him thenâ Mne. I'll mend my pace. Pist. All hail! Mnesilochus! Mne. All hail to you! Pist. We'll on your safe arrival give a supper. Mne. Supper I relish not which raises cholerâ Pist. How's that?âSince your arrival have you met Any vexation?â Mne. Yes, a dreadful one. Pist. From whence? Mne. From whence?âWhy, from a man Whom I accounted heretofore my friendâ Pist. Many there are, of life and manners such, Who, when you think them friends, are found most false; In promises profuse; in deeds as sparing, Of faith infirm.âNot one, but envies those Whom fortune prospers:âby their indolence, They take good care all envy to escapeâ Mne. You're perfectly acquainted with their manners. FartherâThis one misfortune still attends Their evil disposition; all mankind's Their enemy, nor have they any friends. Others, like fools, they think they have deceiv'd, When they're deceiv'd themselvesâSo is this man, Whom I suppos'd as much a friend to me, As I am to myselfâGreat pains he has taken To do me all the mischief in his power; And my own forces all to turn against me. Pist. He must be a bad man. Mne. I think him so. Pist. I beg you would inform me who he is. Mne. Your friendâFor was he not, I should intreat You'd do him all the harm you could. Pist. Let me But know the man, if by some means I don't Revenge you of him, say I am a coward. Mne. He's a bad man, but is your friend, by Hercules! Pist. The rather therefore, tell me who he is? I set no value on a knave's good will. Mne. I must then tell his nameâI can't avoid it. O Pistoclerus! you have quite undone Me your old crony, and your friendâ Pist. How's this? Mne. How's this?âDid I not write to you from Ephesus, About my love, that you should find her out? Pist. I own you did; and I've discover'd her. Mne. Were there no other courtezans in Athens With whom you might engage, but only her, Whom I had recommended to your care? You fell in love with her yourself, and ill My interest consultedâ Pist. Is your head right? Mne. Deny it notâYour tutor has disclos'd The whole affairâYou've ruin'd me. Pist. What still Provoke me with upbraidingâ Mne. Is it Bacchis You are in love with? Pist. Why, two of that name Are here withinâ Mne. How! two? Pist. And both are sisters. Mne. You tell me idle stories with design. Pist. If you persist to disbelieve my tale, I'll hoist you on my back, and take you in By forceâ Mne. Stay but a moment and I'll go. Pist. That's what I will not doâNor yet shall you Suspect me falselyâ Mne. Then I'll follow you. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter the PARASITE and a BOY. PARASITE. Of a debauch'd, lewd, military man I am the Parasite, who a mistress brought With him from Samos, and has order'd me To go and ask, if she'll pay back the gold, Or will return with himâBoyâYou, who long Have waited on her, which soe'er's the house, Knock at itâHye thee to the door forthwithâ [the Boy goes to knock. Come back, a mischief on thee!âLook you, how The graceless scoundrel knocks!âThou could'st devour A loaf three feet in width, yet know'st not how A door to knock atâHo! Is any one Within there!âHo!âWho is within doors? Ho! [calling. Who opens me the door?âWho is't comes out?â SCENE II. Enter PISTOCLERUS. Pist. What is the matter here?âFor what's this knocking? What plague possesses you, thus to exert Your utmost strength against another's doors? You've almost broke them downâWhat is't you'd have? Par. Save you, young gentleman!â Pist. Save you!âBut whom D'you want? Par. Why Bacchisâ Pis. Which? Par. I only know That I want BacchisâAnd to say no more, Cleomachus the captain sent me to her, That she two hundred golden PhilippÃ¦ans Should strait pay back, or go this very day From hence, with him into Elatia. Pis. She does not goâSay you, she does not go. Be gone, and tell your master thisâShe loves Another now, not himâAvoid the house. Par. You are too hastyâ Pis. Don't you know how much so? Your chaps are in a dangerous situation, These my tooth-breakers itch so to be doing. Par. If right I understand, I must take care My nut-crackers sit safe within their sockets. [aside. At your own peril, I'll return your answer. Pis. What say you?â Par. Why, I'll tell him what you bid me. Pis. Who are you? Sayâ Par. One of his body guard. Pis. Who has so bad a guard, can ne'er be good. Par. He'll come blown up with rageâ Pis. Then may he burst! Par. Would you ought else? Pis. Your absence instantly. It must be soâ Par. Youâtooth-breaker, farewell. Pis. The same farewell to you, you body guard. [Exit Parasite. The business now is come to such a point I know not what advice to give my friend, Who, in a foolish pet, has to his father Return'd back all the money; nor has left A single piece wherewith to pay the captain. But hark! The doors creak!âHither I'll retire. Mnesilochus comes forth; and pensive tooâ [stands apart. SCENE III. Enter MNESILOCHUS. Mne. Born with a froward, inconsiderate temper, Ungovernable, hot, and without mean, Or modesty, or equity or honour, I'm insolent and rude, hard of belief, Ungracious, sour, and scarcely in my wits, By nature ill dispos'dâIn short, I am Myself, the very thing I would not wish Another man to beâAnd is this credible? There's not a more unthrifty wretch, nor one Who less deserves the favour of the gods, Whom none will make his friend or his companion. Not friends, but enemies I ought to haveâ 'Tis fitter I should have the help of knaves, Than honest menâAll the reproach and shame That knaves deserve, no man's more worthy of. Who, madman like, have paid back to my father, The money which I had in handâAnd am I not Myself a wretch?âAnd Chrysalus's plot I've ruin'dâ Pis. It would be a friendly part In me, to give him comfortâI'll accost him. [Aside] How goes it now, Mnesilochus? Mne. Undone!â Pis. The gods forbid! Mne. Undone! Pis. Don't talk so, simpleton. Mne. Not talk!â Pis. You are not in your perfect mind. Mne. Undone!âA thousand sharp and poignant griefs Distract my soulâShould I have credited The charge!âI have been angry, and have had No cause. Pis. Have a good heart. Mne. Whence have it?âSay. A dead man's of more worth than I am now. Pis. The captain's parasite has just been here, And to demand the moneyâI have rattled him; And drove him out of doorsâI've chac'd the rogue Awayâ Mne. And what avail?âWretch that I am! What shall I do?âI've now no money left. He'll carry her off I knowâ Pis. I'd not engage it, Had I but moneyâ Mne. Why, I know you'd give itâ I've known you longâBut, was you not in love, I should not now so readily believe you. You've too much business of your own at present; I can't expect, that you, who are in want Yourself, can possibly assist your friend. Pis. Be silent, and some god will send us aid. Mne. 'Tis trifling! [going. Pis. Stayâ Mne. Well, what's the matter now? Pis. 'Tis your sheet anchor Chrysalus, I see. SCENE IV. Enter CHRYSALUS. Chry. To erect a golden statue to this man, [pointing to himself. Is right and fitâHe's worth his weight in goldâ Two great exploits have I atchiev'd to-day, And by them double plunder have I gotâ How finely my old master have I bit! How he's been fool'd!âI with my crafty arts Persuaded and constrain'd the old crafty cuff To credit every thing I saidâAnd now For my young master, for the man in love, With whom I eat and drink, and sport away, I have procur'd a royal fund of gold; That he from his own heaps may take at home, And not, when he wants money, hunt abroad. Those Parmeno's, those Syrus's I hate Who from their master filch two or three minÃ¦. And the worst thing I know of, is a slave Who wants a headâwhose brains are not well stock'd, From whence, as need requires, he may draw out. None can be wise, who is not as expert In doing mischief, as in doing goodâ With knaves to be a knave, and filchâWith thieves A thief, and steal whatever comes to handâ The prudent man should often shift his shapeâ If he is wise indeed, good with the good He'll ever be, and with the bad, be badâ Just as things are, so will he frame his humour. But now I long to know, what share my master Took of the gold to his own proper use; And what he paid his fatherâIf he's prudent, He serv'd him just as they serve Hercules; Gave him a tenth, and kept nine parts himself. But see! the person I was looking forâ He in good time approachesâ[to him.] So, my master, Why with your eyes so fix'd upon the ground? Is any of your money fal'n upon it? Why see I you so sorrowful and sad? I like it notâNor is my judgement rashâ Why don't you answer me? Mne. I'm ruin'd, Chrysalusâ Chry. Perhaps you took too little of the money? Mne. How! knave, too little!âYes, a monstrous deal Too little.â Chry. Then, why did you, simpleton; When, by my management, I had procur'd So fair an opportunity, that you Might take just what you pleas'd, thus pinch it up Betwixt your finger and your thumbâNot know How very seldom such occasions offer? Mne. Why, you mistakeâ Chry. Ay, and you did the same When deep enough you did not dip. Mne. In troth, Did you know more, you'd blame me moreâI am ruin'd. Chry. My mind forebodes more mischief in these words. Mne. I'm ruin'dâ Chry. How so? Mne. I've paid back the gold, Ay, dust and allâ Chry. Paid back!â Mne. Paid back, I say.â Chry. What all?â Mne. Ay, to an atom. Chry. We're demolish'd. How could it come into your head, to do So foul a deed? Mne. Why, I from Lydus' charge Suspected Bacchis, and that young man there, [pointing to Pistoclerus. Had play'd me false; and in a fit of wrath Paid back the moneyâ Chry. Well then, and what said you, When you paid back the money to your father? Mne. That I from Archidemides his host, Had just receiv'd it. Chry. How!âThat speech to-day Will drive poor Chrysalus strait to the torture. For soon as e'er the old man spies me out, He'll take me into custody at once. Mne. My father I've besoughtâ Chry. What! I suppose To do the thing I have been talking ofâ Mne. Nay, not to punish you, not to be angry; And have, with much ado, prevail'd.âNow Chrysalus, Here is another business for you stillâ Chry. What other business?â Mne. Open a new road. Contrive, devise, invent just what you please. Your own way model it, that artfully This artful man you may deceive to-day, And carry off the gold. Chry. It scarce seems possible. Mne. Go on with it, you'll easily effect it. Chry. Easily!âPlague on't: but this very now He caught me in a downright lyeâAnd if I should intreat him, every thing I say To disbelieve, he'd not trust even that. Mne. Nay, if you heard but what he said of you? Chry. Why, what was't that he said of me? Mne. He said, If you affirm'd the sun to be the sun, He would believe it was the moon; and night, When now 'tis day. Chry. I'll fairly wipe his noseâ I'll warrant him, he shan't say that for nothing. Mne. What would you have us do? Chry. I've no commands For you, only proceed in your amoursâ As to the rest, demand what sum you please, I'll give it youâWhat is't to me to have The name of gold, and not the thingâBut now What is the sum you want, Mnesilochus? Tell meâ Mne. For Bacchis' use, to pay the captain, I want two hundred piecesâ Chry. WellâI'll give it you. Mne. Then to defray common expencesâ Chry. Ah!â Let us go on deliberately; and when One thing is done, we'll set about the nextâ 'Gainst the old man, for the two hundred pieces My engine will I first applyâIf I With help of that can batter down the tower, The outworks; next then at the gate will I Attack the old and antient town itself; And, if I carry it, carry to your friends Baskets of gold, as much as heart can wish.â Pis. O Chrysalus, our hopes are plac'd in thee. Chry. Now, Pistoclerus, go you in to Bacchis, And quickly bringâ Pis. Bring what? Chry. A style, and wax, Some tablets, and some tapeâ Pis. It shall be done. [Exit Pist. Mne. What will you do now? tell meâ[to Chry.] Dinner's ready. Chry. There'll be you twoâAnd then your mistressâShe Will make a thirdâ Mne. According to your way Of reckoning. Chry. Pistoclerus has no mistressâ Mne. Nay, but he hasâAnd she is hereâI love One sister, he the otherâBoth are Bacchis. Chry. What do you say? Mne. But how accommodated? Chry. Where are your couches plac'd? Mne. Why ask you that? Chry. Why so it isâI wish you'd therefore tell me. You know not what I am about to do; Nor what a great exploit I shall attempt. Mne. Give me your hand, and follow to the doorâ Peep inâ Chry. [looking into Bacchis's house.] Huzza! a most delicious place; And just the very thing that I could wish. Re-enter PISTOCLERUS. Pis. Your orders are obey'd with expeditionâ To the obedient, orders are well givenâ Chry. Wellâwhat is't you have brought? Pis. Just every thing You order'dâ Chry. [to Mne.] Take the tablets, and the style: Be quickâ Mne. What then? Chry. Write down then what I bid you. I'd for this reason have you write, because Your father, when he reads, may know the handâ Now writeâ Mne. Write what? Chry. Salute your father, but In your own wordsâ Pis. Suppose now he should write Death and disease? That surely would be better. Mne. Don't interrupt usâ[writing.] I've wrote what you order'd. Chry. Read it. Mne. [reading.] âMnesilochus sends health to his father.â Chry. Be quick, write this besidesââMy father, Chrysalus âAbuses me in every place, because âI paid you back the gold, and did not cheat you.â Pis. Stay till 'tis wroteâ Chry. A lover should write quick. Pis. He's nimbler far to lavish, than to write. Mne. That's wroteâWhat next? Chry. âNow be upon your guard. âHe's forming plots to rob you of the money, âAnd has declar'd he certainly will have it.â Write legibly. Mne. You dictate then. Chry. âAnd promises âThe gold to me, which I may give to strumpets, âAnd eat and drink, and riot in the stews. âBeware he don't impose upon you, father. âI beg you'd be upon your guard.â Mne. Say on. Chry. Well, write then. Mne. Tell me what to write. Chry. âI beg you, âFather, remember what you promised meâ âNot to chastise him, but to keep him bound âAt homeââGive me forthwith the wax and tape. Come, come, be quickâTye them and seal them up. Mne. What is your reason, pray, for writing this? That he should give no credit to whate'er You said, and keep you bound at home? Chry. Because It is my whimâCan't you indulge yourself, And meddle not with me?âTo my own powers Trusting, this business I at first began; And 'tis at my own peril I proceed. Mne. Why you say true. Chry. Give me the letter. Mne. Take it. Chry. Attend then both of youâYou Pistoclerus, And you Mnesilochus, take to your couches; Go both, and with your mistresses recline, And briskly put the glass about, where now Your couches are prepar'd. Pis. Would you ought else? Chry. Why thisâWhen you are once sat down, stir not A foot, till I have given you the signal. Pis. An excellent commander!â Chry. Why ere this, You ought to have drank twiceâ Mne. Well then, away. Chry. See that you do your duty, I'll do mine. [Exit. Mne. and Pist. SCENE V. CHRYSALUS alone. Chry. A matter of great pith I undertake, And how I shall to-day accomplish it I have my fearsâA churlish, crusty chap I have to deal withâ'Twould not suit my plot, At our first interview he should be calmâ Well, if I live, I'll turn him well to-day, And parch him well, as pea was ever parch'dâ I'll walk before the door, and put immediately The tablet in his hands as he comes out. SCENE VI. Enter NICOBULUS. Nic. It vexes me, that Chrysalus to-day Has thus escap'd meâ Chry. [aside.] So, so, safe's the word, The old man's in a passionâNow's the time For me to accost my manâ Nic. Who speaks hard by? 'Tis surely Chrysalusâ Chry. I'll strait accost him. Nic. My honest slave, all hail! How fares it with you? What's on the anvil now? How soon am I To sail to Ephesus to fetch my gold Home from Theotimus?âWhat, art thou speechless? I swear most solemnly by all the gods, Had I not lov'd my son so very well, And wish to please him to his heart's content, Your sides by this had been well lash'd with rods, And at the mill you'd spend your life in chains. All your abominable pranks, I from Mnesilochus have learn'd. Chry. Has he accus'd me?â Why best of allâI am a knave, a curs'd one, A wicked knaveâLook now to your affairs, I will not say one wordâ Nic. Do you threaten, hang-dog? Chry. You soon will find what kind of man he is. He order'd me to bring these tablets to you, And begs, what he has wrote there may be done. Nic. Well, give them me. Chry. Take notice of the seal. [giving a tablet. Nic. I know it wellâWhere is he? Chry. I can't say. I need know nothing nowâI've every thing ForgotâI know indeed that I'm a slave. Ev'n what I know, I am most ignorant of. Now at the worm, the ouzel through the springe, [aside.] Is aiming; he'll be fairly noos'd to-day; So well I've set my snareâ Nic. So, Chrysalus, Stay here a little, I'll return directly. [Exit. Nic. Chry. How he dissembles with me!âAnd how ignorant He thinks I am of what he's gone about. He is gone in to fetch his slaves to bind me. My ship sails right before the windâShe'll safe Arrive in portâBut hush! the doors are opening. SCENE VII. Re-enter NICOBULUS with slaves. Nic. Here Artamo, bind you his hands forthwith. Chry. What have I done? Nic. And, if he dares to mutter, Why, knock him downâWhat says this tablet? Ha! Chry. Why ask you me?âI gave it to you seal'd, As I from him receiv'd it. Nic. Answer, rascal! Have you not frequently in talk abus'd My son, because he gave me back the gold? Have you not said, that notwithstanding that, By your base acts you'd get the gold again? Chry. Have I said so? Nic. You have. Chry. Where is the man, Who dares affirm I said it? Nic. PeaceâNo man says so. The tablet which you gave but now, convicts you. Look hereâ'Tis this commands you to be bound. [shewing the tablet. Chry. Your son has made me a Bellerophon. I am myself the bearer of a tablet, Which orders me in bondsâWellâBe it so. Nic. This I do only, that you may persuade My son, that he may drink and riot with you, You threefold villain. Chry. Fool, O silly fool! You know not now you are on sale, and stand Upon the stone, where stands the auctioneer. Nic. Who sells me? Sayâ Chry. He whom the gods protect. The youth is dying, whilst he is in health, And has his senses and his judgement sound. This man, had any good regarded him, Ten years, ay more, full twenty years ago, Had left the worldâHe crawls, a useless weight Upon the earth, and neither judgement has, Nor yet his sensesâHe's worth just as much As a stale, rotten mushroom. Nic. Do you think That I'm a useless weight upon the earth? Away with him, and tye him to the postâ You shall not take away the gold from me. Chry. No, you will give it me. Nic. I give it you! Chry. Nay, to receive it, of your own accord You will intreat me, when you come to know In what a dangerous situation My accuser is, you'll offer Chrysalus His freedom; nor will Chrysalus accept it. Nic. Tell me, thou villain, tell me, what's the danger Mnesilochus, my son, is in? Chry. Then this way Follow, and you shall know. Nic. And whither follow? Chry. Only three stepsâ Nic. Ay ten steps, if you will. Chry. A matchâCome on thenâArtamo, do you Open the door a little wayâSoâgentlyâ Don't make it creakâSoâThat's enoughâCome hitherâ [to Nicobulus. Do you not see the entertainment? Nic. [looking in.] Yes, I Pistoclerus see, and Bacchis opposite. Chry. And who do you see upon the other couch? Nic. Wretch, I'm undone! Chry. Say, do you know the man? Nic. I do. Chry. Now tell me your opinion, prayâ Do you think the woman handsome? Nic. Very handsome. Chry. And do you take her for a strumpet? Nic. Certainly. Chry. You're quite mistaken. Nic. Well, who is she then? Chry. Discover that yourselfâIn this affair You'll not by me be wiser made to-day. SCENE VIII. Enter CLEOMACHUS. Cleo. How!âNicobulus' son Mnesilochus, By downright violence detain my mistress! What an abominable deed! Nic. Who's this? Chry. [aside.] The captain's opportunely come. Cleo. He deems me A woman rather than a soldier sure, who can't Defend myself nor mine; no, nor Bellona, Nor even Mars, believe me e'er again, If I don't make of him a lifeless corse: If I should chance to meet with him, I'll separate His body from his soul. Nic. Who is it, Chrysalus? This man, I say, that threatens so my son? Chry. The husband of the punk upon the couch with him. Nic. Her husband, say you? Chry. Yes, her husband, sir. Nic. What! is she married then? Chry. You'll know anon. Nic. Wretch that I am, I'm utterly undone! Chry. Does Chrysalus appear a villain now? Come, bind me; and now hearken to your son. Did I not tell you, you'd discover soon What sort of man he isâ Nic. What shall I do? Chry. Why, order me to be unbound forthwith; If I am not, he'll crush him e'en to death. Cleo. To catch these lovers in each other's arms, That I might kill them both, would better please me, Than would a mint of money. Chry. Don't you hear What he is saying?âWhy not order me To be unbound?â Nic. Unbind him, slavesâI'm ruin'dâ [they unbind him. Wretch that I am, O what a fright I'm in! Cleo. Then she, that publick prostitute, shan't say, She's found a man to make a laughing-stockâ Chry. You may make up this matter for a trifle. Nic. Prithee, then make it up for what you will, So he don't catch him in the fact, and kill him. Cleo. If I have not two hundred PhilippÃ¦ans Paid me down rug, I'll swallow both their souls. Nic. Come into terms with him if possible; Agree with him for any sumâ [to Chrysalus. Chry. I'll go And do my bestâ[to Cleomachus.] Why do you clamour so? Cleo. Where is your master? Chry. No whereâHow should I know? Would you have promis'd you two hundred pieces, To make no riot, nor no brawling here? Cleo. Nought I desire moreâ Chry. And that I may Abuse you soundlyâ Cleo. To your heart's contentâ Chry. [aside.] How civilly the rascal fawns upon us! This is the father of Mnesilochusâ [aloud. Follow me thenâDemand of him the money. He will engage for'tâI need say no moreâ Nic. Well, how go mattersâ [to Chry. Chry. I have made the bargain, And for two hundred PhilippÃ¦ans paid him. Nic. Well done!âMy goddess Salus, thou hast sav'd me. How soon am I to tell him I will pay it? Chry. Ask him [to Cleo.] And you now promise him the money? [to Nicobulus.] Nic. I doâ[to Cleo.] Come ask me. Cleo. Well thenâWill you give me Two hundred PhilippÃ¦ans, lawful money?â Say, will you give them? Answerâ Nic. I will give them. Chry. Well, what now, filth, is there aught owing to you? What have you now to plague him with? What now, To frighten him with death? Both he and I Will do you some ill turnâIf you've a sword, We have a spit at homeâIf you provoke me, With that I'll make your skin a cullender. By Hercules! I found, some time ago, What the suspicion was that harass'd you. You thought my master with your wife. Cleo. And so He isâ Chry. And so may Jupiter, and Juno, May Ceres and Latona, Pallas, Spes, May Ops, may Virtus, Venus, Castor, Pollux, Mars, Mercury, Hercules, Summanus, Sol, Saturn, and every god so prosper me, As he reclines not with her on the couch, Nor walks with her, nor kisses her, nor does What fame, that lying jade, reports of him. Nic. Gods! how he swears!âHe'll save me by his perjury! Cleo. Where then at this time is Mnesilochus? Chry. His father's just into the country sent him, And she's gone to the citadel, to visit Pallas's templeâThe doors open now, Go see if she is there. Cleo. I'll goâBut, to the forum. Chry. Or rather to the gallowsâ Cleo. And may I To-day demand the money of him? Chry. Yesâ Demand it, and go hang yourselfâDo you think That I would stay here to intreat you, scoundrel! [Exit Cleomachus. SoâHe's mov'd offâBy the immortal gods! I beg you, master, give me leave to go In hither to your son. Nic. Why, go in there? Chry. That I may, since in such a way he acts, With many words correct him. Nic. Prithee, do so. And, Chrysalus, take 'special care, I beg you, You do not spare him. Chry. You pretend to instruct me! Is't not sufficient, if from me to-day He hear more sharp reproaches, than e'er Clinia Heard from Demetrius.â [Exit. Nic. This fellow here, Is like a watery eyeâwhich, if you have not, You never wish for itâBut if you have it, You can't keep off your hands from rubbing it. For had he not, by great good luck, to-day Been here, his wife and my Mnesilochus The captain had surpriz'd, and her gallant Had murder'd, caught so plainly in the fact. Now in some sort have I redeem'd my son With these two hundred PhilippÃ¦ans, which I promised to give the captainâBut I will not be so rash to pay him, till I've seen my sonâBy Pollux' temple! lightly I shall not trust again this Chrysalus In any thingâBut I've a mind to read These tablets once againâIt is but right That, when they're seal'd, I should give credit to them. SCENE IX. Re-enter CHRYSALUS, with a bag of money. Chry. Renown'd the deed!âAnd Atreus' sons obtain'd Immortal fame; what time, when Priam's Troy Founded by hands divine, with horse and arms, And bands of men, by chosen warriors led, And with a thousand sail of ships, was sack'd In twice five yearsâOld Peleus' son was not An engine of such force as I; who have Without a fleet, an army, or so great An host of men, my master's castle storm'dâ I have subdu'd, and taken from his father The money for my master, who's in love. Let me, or e'er he comes, weep o'er the lossâ O Troy! my country, Pergamus, O Priam! Old Sophister, you're ruin'dâMost unhappily Four hundred PhilippÃ¦ans you are chous'd of. The tablets seal'd, and counterseal'd I bring: They are not tablets, but the wooden horse, The Grecians sent to Troy; and Pistoclerus Epius is. His schemeâMnesilochus Is Sinon, left behindâSee where he is, Not at Achilles' tomb, but on a couch With Bacchis in his armsâSinon had fire To give the Greeks a signalâBacchis is His flameâAnd I Ulysses am, whose counsels The stratagem conductâAnd the contents Of these same tablets are the soldiers arm'd And spirited, inclos'd within the horseâ Thus far our scheme has met with more success Than the Greeks met withâNot the citadel, It is the coffer which this horse attacks; And to the old man's money, will to-day Bring ruin and destructionâWith great truth To this old fool, I give the name of Troyâ The captain Menelaus is, and I Both Agamemnon, and Laertes' son Ulysses: and Mnesilochus is Paris, Who was to be the ruin of his countryâ Helen he took by force.âOn her account I now lay siege to TroyâAnd I have heard, What I am now, Ulysses was, a bold And mischief-enterprizing manâAnd I Am in my stratagems detectedâHe In rags discover'd, narrowly escap'd, Whilst he was searching out the fate of Troy: Not unlike his, has been my hap to-dayâ I have been bound; but by my art escap'dâ So he by artifice preserv'd himselfâ I've heard three destinies attended Troy; Either of which were fatalâIf the image Should from the citadel be stol'n awayâ Another, Troilus' deathâA third, When th'upper lintel of the ScÃ¦an gate Should be demolish'dâSimilar to these, Three fates attend our TroyâAnd for the first, When of the host, the money, and the bark To the old man I told the fabulous tale, Then the Palladium from the fort I tookâ Two destinies remain'd; else I should not Have sack'd the townâWhen I the tablets brought, Then I kill'd TroilusâWhen he suppos'd Mnesilochus was with the captain's wife, With much ado I disengag'd myselfâ This danger I compare to what Ulysses, When he was known by Helen, underwent; And was betray'd to Hecuba, as says ReportâBut by his soothing arts, himself He freed, and his escape his tongue procur'dâ So, by my art, this danger I've escap'd, And the old man deceiv'dâI then engag'd The blustering captain; he who takes, unarm'd, A city with his tongue; and drove him offâ Then the old fellow fist to fist I fought, And with a single lye I conquer'd him, By which one stroke I bore away the spoilsâ Two hundred PhilippÃ¦ans to the captain, According to his promise, will he giveâ Now Troy is sack'd, we want two hundred more, To be distributed amongst the soldiers; That with rich wine they may rejoice their hearts. Our Priam far excells Priam of oldâ Not only fifty, but four hundred sons He has; all without blemish, pick'd and choice. All these, this day, I with two single strokes Will clean cut offâAnd now for our old Priamâ Could I but find a purchaser, I'd sell This venerable piece, whom I shall have For sale, as soon as I have storm'd the townâ But see, our Priam standing at the gate, I'll go and speak to him. Nic. Whose voice sounds near me? Chry. Hist! Nicobulus! Nic. WellâWhat ar't about? Have you done ought in the affair, on which I sent you?â Chry. Ask you that?âCome nearer to me. Nic. Well, well, I do so. Chry. I'm an orator Most excellentâBy rating him with all The bitter terms I could devise, I forc'd The water down his cheeks. Nic. And what then said he? Chry. Why, not a syllableâBut weeping, heard In silence all I saidâNor open'd once His lipsâHe then a tablet wrote and seal'd it; Then bade me bring it youâIt sings, I fear, The same vile song, the other tablet sang. You know the seal, is't his? Nic. I know it wellâ I have a mind to read itâ Chry. Read it thenâ The upper lintel shakesâNow Troy's in dangerâ And rarely well the wooden horse performs. Nic. Come hither, Chrysalus, while I read the tabletâ Chry. What need is there of that? Nic. I'll have it soâ That you may do what I command, and know What here is wrote. Chry. I care not what is wroteâ Nor would I knowâ Nic. But comeâ Chry. Why should I come? Nic. Peace, and obeyâ Chry. I comeâ Nic. Bless me! how small The letters are!â Chry. To one who sees but illâ To those of better sight, they're large enough. Nic. Attendâ Chry. I say, I'll not. Nic. I say, you shall. Chry. What need of it? Nic. What I command you, do. Chry. 'Tis right, your slave should serve you in the way You like.â Nic. Now mind the business. Chry. When you please, Read outâMy ears are all attention to you. Nic. Truly he has not spar'd or wax, or style. But be that as it may, I'll read it through. âSir, I beseech you, give to Chrysalus, [reading. âAt sight of this, two hundred PhilippÃ¦ans, âAs you'd preserve my safety and my life.â Chry. I can't but curse you now, by Hercules! Nic. Why, what's the matter? Chry. He don't send you health. Nic. I do not find that out. Chry. If in your senses, You will not give the moneyâIf you give him Ever so much, let him, if he is wise, Find out some other porterâI'll not carry it, Be your injunctions e'er so strictâYou have Suspected me enough, when I've been innocent. Nic. Well, well, attend while I read what is wrote. Chry. From the beginning, 'tis a saucy letter. Nic. [reading.] âI am asham'd to appear before you, sir; âI'm told, you know of my debaucheries, âAnd my intriguing with the captain's wife.â Troth, that's no jest, but serious, sober sadness. Two hundred PhilippÃ¦ans have I promis'd Because of that foul deed, to save your life. Chry. And everything of this I've told him of. Nic. [reading.[ âI've acted foolishly, I own; but, father, âTho' in my duty I have fail'd, I beg you, âGo not so far, to leave me in my follyâ âPush'd on my fierce desire, my eyes became âMy masters, and I've done a frontless deed âI blush at now, and am asham'd of it.â Better it were that you had taken heed Before, than now to be asham'd. Chry. I said The same to him word for word, not long ago. Nic. [reading.] âMy father, I intreat you, think it is âEnough, that Chrysalus has most severely âWith many, many cutting words reproach'd me; âAnd, as I trust, has, by these precepts, made me âA better manâ'Tis just you thank him for it.â Chry. Is that there in the letter?â Nic. Look and see, And then you'll know. Chry. How humble is to all, And of his own accord, the guilty man! Nic. [reading.] âIf, father, I may now presume to offer âMy humble suit, two hundred PhilippÃ¦ans âI beg of youââ Chry. Not one, unless you're mad. By Hercules! not oneâ Nic. Let me read onâ [reading.] âThat is the sum I solemnly have sworn âTo give the woman, e're at night she leaves me. âLet me not now, my father, be forswornâ âAnd with all speed remove me from her house; âFrom her, on whose account I've spent so much; âAnd have been guilty of so foul a crime. âAnd let not, sir, the money give you painâ âIf I should live, I'll pay you back three-foldâ âFather, farewell, and think upon these thingsââ Now what is your opinion, Chrysalus? Chry. I can give no advice in this affair, Nor will I interfere, lest you should say, If ought goes wrong, 'twas done by my advice. But yet, in my opinion, was I you, I'd rather give the money, than I'd suffer him To be debauch'dâYou have a double choiceâ Take heed which way you take, either to lose The gold, or let the lover be forsworn. I order not, forbid not, nor persuade. Nic. I pity himâ Chry. I wonder not you should. He is your sonâIf more was to be spent, It would be sweeter far to waste your money, Than publish his disgrace among the herdâ Nic. By Pollux! I'd much rather he had been At Ephesus, so he'd been safe and well, Than that to me he had come home again. Since it must go, why don't I speed its going? I'll now fetch twice two hundred PhilippÃ¦ans, Wretch that I am! those which I had engag'd To pay the captain, and these two besides.â You, Chrysalus, stay hereâI'll strait return. [Exit. Chry. Troy's now laid waste, the chiefs have storm'd the town. I knew long since, that I should ruin Pergamus. 'Troth I dare wager no great sum with him, Who says, that I deserve to suffer torture, Such bustle and confusion here I makeâ But the door creaksâThey're bringing out the plunder From this our Troyâ'Tis time to hold my tongue. Re-enter NICOBULUS. Nic. Here, take this moneyâBear it to my sonâ I'll to the Forum strait, and pay the captain. Chry. I'll not receive itâGo and seek one out To bear it to himâI will not be trusted. Nic. Nay take itâNow you teize meâ Chry. I'll not take itâ Nic. I prithee doâ Chry. I tell you but the truth. Nic. You only hinder meâ Chry. I tell you plainly, Trust not with me the moneyâOr at least Provide a guard to watch my motions, sirâ Nic. Enough, enough, you teize meâ Chry. Give it me, Since it must be soâ Nic. Here, take care of it. [giving the money. I'll return hither back immediately. [Exit Nic. Chry. Yes, I have taken care that you shall be A miserable manâWell, this it is To bring a business to a good conclusionâ As in my own case nowâLoaded with plunder, How I rejoiceâThe town reduc'd by stratagem, Ourselves all safe, I bring my army home IntireâSpectators, wonder not, I don't Appear in triumphâ'Tis a common thingâ I do not value itâBut let the men Be entertain'd with a good cup of wine. I'll now bear all the spoils unto the Questorâ [Exit. SCENE X. Enter PHILOXENUS. Phil. The more I twist and turn it in my thoughts, What strange disturbances my son has rais'd; In what amours he has engag'd himself, And headlong rush'd into, the more I fear; The more is my concern, lest he should be Debauch'd and ruin'dâI have not forgot itâ I once was in my prime, and did all this MyselfâBut then 'twas in a decent mannerâ I can't but disapprove the present mode That fathers use in managing their sons. I've had my wench, and brought her home with me, Indulg'd myself in feasts and drinking-boutsâ Have given presentsâBut these things were seldom. So I resolv'd to give my son some liberty To gratify his youthful inclinationsâ I thought it was but right: but not to indulge In sloth and idlenessâI'll now go see Whether Mnesilochus has brought back my son To virtue and sobrietyâAnd that I'm sure he has done, if he has met with himâ For that's his disposition from his infancy. [Exit. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter NICOBULUS. NICOBULUS. Who are, who have been, or from hence shall be Fools, noddies, ideots, dolts, oafs, sots, and blockheads, I, single I, exceed them all in folly, And in absurdity of manners too. I am undone, and am asham'd to say so. Ought I not blush too, at my time of life, Twice in a day to be so gull'dâThe more I think upon the stir my son has made, The more I am incens'd. I'm utterly Undone and ruin'dâVex'd a thousand waysâ All plagues attend me, and I die all deaths. That rascal Chrysalus this day has plunder'd me, Wretch that I am! he has robb'd me of my money. With his keen tricks, just as the villain pleas'd, He has shav'd me to the quickâFor now, the Captain Says plainly, that this Bacchis is his mistress, Whom Chrysalus affirm'd to be his wife. He has inform'd me of the whole affair, That he had hir'd her for a yearâThe sum She had to pay in order to be off, Was what I in the heighth of folly promis'd. 'Tis this, 'tis this, which makes me so uneasy, This is the only thing which tortures me. In my old age to be so gull'd and fool'd! And with a hoary head, and snowy beard To be thus trick'd and cheated of my money! That my own slave should dare to hold me cheap! Undone, undone!âBy other means I could Have lost much more, have ta'en it less to heart, And should have thought the loss not half so great. Enter PHILOXENUS. Phil. Some one, I'm sure, seems talking not far off, I know not whom. But who is this I see? Sure 'tis the father of Mnesilochus. Nic. My brother in affliction and misfortune. All hail! to you, Philoxenus. Phil. The same To youâwhence come you? Nic. From a place, from whence A luckless, and a wretched man should come. Phil. And I'm, by Pollux! in the very place, Just where a wretched, luckless man should be. Nic. Our fortunes, and our ages are alike. Phil. Even soâBut what has hap'd to you? Nic. In troth Much such ill hap as your'sâ Phil. And is this sorrow, Upon your son's account? Nic. Yes truly, 'tis. Phil. I have the same disease at heart. Nic. That Chrysalus, That precious villain has undone my son, And ruin'd me, and all my fortune. Phil. Prithee, Tell me what's this affair about your son? Nic. Why, you shall hearâMy son, and your's with him, Are both undoneâFor each of them has got His mistress. Phil. And how know you that? Nic. I saw them. Phil. Alas! I'm ruin'd. Nic. Why then don't we knock, And bid them both come out? Phil. You've my consent. Nic. Ho! Bacchis! Bacchis, ho!âThis instant order The door be open'd, if you would not have That, and the pillars too knock'd down with hatchets. [Knocks at Bacchis's door. SCENE II. Enter 1 BACCHIS and 2 BACCHIS. 1 Bac. Who is it that with such a noise and tumult, Calls on my name, and knocks thus at the door? Nic. I, and this man here. 1 Bac. What's this business, say? Prithee, who was it drove these sheep to us? Nic. These worst of hussies call us sheep. 2 Bac. Their shepherd Is sure asleep, since from the flock they come Thus straggling. 1 Bac. They look mighty white, and both Are very clean. 2 Bac. They both have just been shorn. Phil. Mark how they seem to flout us! Nic. Ay, ay, let them Go on just as they please. 1 Bac. D'you think they're shorn Three times a year? 2 Bac. Why one has been twice shorn This very dayâThat's fact. 1 Bac. These ancient beasts Love thyme. 2 Bac. I think they've once been in good plight. 1 Bac. See how they cast a sheep's eye at usâLook! 2 Bac. I'll answer for't they have no ill design. Phil. 'Troth we deserve all this for coming hither. 1 Bac. Drive them to fold. 2 Bac. There's no occasion for it. They've neither milk, nor woolâLet them stand here. How valuable so e'er they may have been, They're now grown out of date. The fruit is drop'd Quite off the treeâYou see they stray alone. I fancy they are dumb with ageâThey don't So much as bleat, tho' absent from their flock. 1 Bac. They seem but silly, harmless sheepâCome, sister, Let us go in again. Nic. Stay both of you. The sheep would speak to you. 1 Bac. Prodigious this! Sheep call us in a human voice! Phil. These sheep Will pay you all the injuries they owe you. 1 Bac. If aught you owe me, I forgive it you. Keep it yourself, I never will demand it. But what's the reason why you threaten us? Phil. Because they say, our lambs are lock'd up here. Nic. Besides these lambs, I have a curst cur there. And, if you don't produce; and send them out, We shall be metamorphos'd into rams; And furiously attack you. 1 Bac. This way, sister. I've something to communicate apart. 2 Bac. What pray? [they go apart. Nic. [aside] Where are they gone? 1 Bac. Sister, I yield The old fellow, he that's farthest off I mean, To youâWith art cajole him. I'll attack The angry manâWe may entice them in. 2 Bac. I'll do my part. But 'tis an odious task To embrace a corpse. 1 Bac. Endeavour to succeed. 2 Bac. Perform your partâI'll not go from my word. Nic. What are these two consulting there in private? [to Philoxenus. Phil. What say you, friend? Nic. What would you have with me? Phil. There is a certain thing I blush to tell you. Nic. What is't you blush to tell me of? Phil. 'St! 'St!â There is a certain thing I long to trust To you, my friendâ'Tis past a doubt, I'm good For nothing. Nic. Ay, that I've known long since. But what d'you mean by good for nothing? Say. Phil. I'm hamper'd dreadfully indeedâMy heart Perceives the goad. Nic. 'Twere better 'twas your side. But what is it? Tho' I already think I know, I wish to hear it from yourself. Phil. See you this woman? Nic. Yes. Phil. She's not uncomely. Nic. Troth but she isâand you are good for nothing. Phil. In short I'm fall'n in love. Nic. What! you in love! Phil. You murder me. Nic. Why, you old rotten stump, Dare you turn lover at this time of day? Phil. Why not? Nic. It is a shame. Phil. What need of words? I have no quarrel with my sonâNor yet Should you with your's. To love is to be wise. 1 Bac. Follow this way. Nic. Behold, they're coming this way. Alluring jades, ye counsellors to evilâ [to them. What now?âWill you restore our sons? Restore My servant too? Or must I try, what force Will do? Phil. BegoneâYou're not a man, to treat. A handsome woman so. 1 Bac. Best of old men, Do not, let me intreat you, thus pursue With such severity this single fault. Nic. Altho' you're handsome, if you march not off, I'll do you some great mischief. 1 Bac. I shall bear it. Nor do I fear that any blow of your's Will give me pain. Nic. How smooth of speech she is! Alack!âalack!âIn troth I'm sore afraidâ 2 Bac. He grows more calmâCome in with me, and then [to Nicobulus. If you're inclin'd, reprove your son. Nic. Avaunt!â Hence, harlotryâ 1 Bac. Let me prevail upon you, My dear! my life! Nic. What! you prevail upon me! 1 Bac. I'm sure, I shall prevail on this good man! [meaning Philoxenus. Phil. I beg it as a favour, shew me in. 2 Bac. O charming man! Phil. You know, on what condition, You're to conduct me in. 2 Bac. That you are with me. Phil. You mention every thing which I desire. Nic. Bad men I've seen; but never worse than you. Phil. I'm as you see. 1 Bac. Come, come, go in with me, Where you shall elegantly be receiv'd With wines, with perfumes, and delicious viands. Nic. Fine treats enough you've had at my expence. How I may be receiv'd, it recks me not. My son and Chrysalus have chous'd me out of Four hundred PhilippÃ¦ans; for the which If I not torture him, I don't deserve Ever again to have so great a sum. 1 Bac. Suppose that half the money be return'd, Will you go in, and pardon both their faults? Phil. He shall. Nic. I'll notâBy no meansâI dont care. Let me aloneâI'd rather be reveng'd On both. Phil. You man of nothing, see you lose not, By your neglect, the favour of the Gods. Take half the money, drink, and have your wench. Nic. What! in the place, the very place wherein My son has been debauch'd, can I carouse? Phil. Yes, there we must carouse. Nic. Well, do so then. Altho' 'tis scandalous, I yet will bear it, And bring my mind to do it. [pausing] What! shall she Be with my son on the same couch, and I A looker on? 1 Bac. NoâBy my troth, with you, On the same couch, and you shall be my love, And I'll caress you. Nic. How my head does itch! I'm a lost manâNo, I can scarce deny her. 1 Bac. And don't you recollect the ancient saw, My dear?âThe time you live, indulge your appetite, For life can ne'er last long; and if you miss The opportunity to day, 'twill not Return again when you are dead and gone. Nic. What shall I do? Phil. Still ask what shall you do? Nic. I long to go, but yet I am afraid. 1 Bac. What is't you fear? Nic. Lest to my son, and servant I should expose myself. 1 Bac. A common case, My love! He is your son. From whence, I prithee, Should he d'you think have money, but from you? Let me persuade you then to pardon both. Nic. How artfully the sly jade works upon me! She has prevail'd on me to change what seem'd As fix'd as fate. By you and by your art I'm sunk beneath myself. 1 Bac. No, no, my dear, You ne'er from me shall tear yourself.âAnd that's As fix'd as fate. Nic. The thing I once have said, I'll never change. 1 Bac. The day wears fastâCome in, And let us to our couches. Now, your sons Within expectâ Nic. How soon we may be dead! 1 Bac. 'Tis eveningâFollowâ Phil. Lead us on as bondmen. 1 Bac. [to the spectators] These men who for their sons had laid a snare Are cleverly entrap'd themselvesâInâIn. [to Nicobulus and Philoxenus. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
