      <field name="fulltext">ACT 1. This Act translated by the late Bonnell Thornton, Esq; SCENE I. Enter THESPRIO, followed by EPIDICUS. EPIDICUS. Hark ye! young man. The. Who pulls me by the cloak, When I am in haste? Epi. A friend,—one of the family. The. I think so: for you're plaguily familiar. Epi. But prithee, Thesprio, turn your head, and view me. The. (turning.) Ha! do I see Epidicus? Epi. Most certainly. You have eyes. The. Save you! Epi. Heav'n grant you all your wish, I'm glad you are arriv'd, and well. The. What next? Epi. The custom; you shall have a treat. The. I promise. Epi. What? The. To accept your treat. Epi. How fares it with you? Do things go as you'd wish? The. Behold the proof. Epi. I understand. Well done! You look more plump, More hearty. The. Thanks to this. (shewing his left hand,) Epi. Which long ago You should have lost. The. But now I pilfer less, Than heretofore. Epi. How so? The. I rob above-board. Epi. The gods confound you! what large strides you take! As soon as I espied you at the port, I set a running, and could hardly catch you. The. You are a milk-sop. Epi. You forsooth, I know, You are a knapsack swaggerer. The. Do, be saucy; Say what you will. Epi. Have you still had your health? The. Chequer'd. Epi. I like it not, such chequer'd health; Whence men are mark'd with stripes, like goats and panthers. The. What would you have me tell you, but the truth? Epi. I'd have you answer what I ask you fairly; How is our master's son? Is he in health? The. Stout as a boxer or a wrestler. Epi. So.— You've brought us joyful tidings. But where is he? The. I came along with him. Epi. Where is he, then? Unless you've brought him in your scrip or wallet. The. Confound you! Epi. I would question you.—Hear me, And you on your part shall be heard in turn.— The. You talk like any judge. Epi. It suits me well. The. You play the prætor on us. Epi. Is there any one In Athens better qualified? The. Yet, one thing Is wanting to your prætorship. Epi. What's that? The. I'll tell you what: two lictors, and their fasces Of elm-twigs for your worship. Epi. Out upon you! But prithee, answer— The. What is't you would ask? Epi. Stratippocles's arms, where are they, say? The. In troth, gone over to the enemy. Epi. His arms? The. Ay, in a crack too— Epi. Seriously? The. Yes, seriously:—the enemy has got them.— Epi. 'Fore heav'n, it was a scurvy deed. The. But others, Have done the same before him:—This affair Will turn out to his honour. Epi. How? The. Because. It has to others, heretofore. Epi. In troth 'Tis my belief, that Vulcan made the arms Born by Stratippocles, they took their flight So quickly to the enemy: then this son Of Thetis, let him lose them; Nereus' daughters Will bring him others. Only let him see, The armourers are provided with materials, If the enemy shall strip him each campaign. The. No more now of these matters. Epi. Make an end Of this discourse then, whensoe'er you please. The. Ask no more questions. Epi. Tell me, where's Stratippocles? The. There is a reason why he was afraid To come along with me. Epi. And what is that? The. He would not see his father yet. Epi. And why? The. I'll tell you. From the plunder he has purchas'd, A captive maid of fair and gentle form. Epi. What do I hear you say? The. That which I speak. Epi. Why did he buy her? The. 'Cause he had a mind to her. Epi. How many minds, I wonder, has he got? For e'er he went from hence to join the troops, He bade me purchase for him of a pandar, A musick-girl, with whom he was enamour'd. I have obey'd his orders. The. When at sea, Just as the wind is, we must shift the sail. Epi. Ah me! he has undone me. The. Wherefore? how? Epi. The girl he purchas'd, how much did she cost him? The. A trifle. Epi. I don't ask you that. The. What then? Epi. How many minæ? The. So many. (holds up his fingers.) Epi. What! forty! Thes. Yes;—of a Theban banker he has taken The money up at interest; and pays A silver mina for it by the day. Epi. Strange! The. And the banker's come along with him, Who wants his money. Epi. Gods! I'm finely done for. The. Why how now? what's the matter? Epi. I am lost. The. Lost? who has lost you? Epi. He, who lost his arms. The. Nay, prithee now, why so? Epi. Day after day He us'd to send me letters from the army, But, mum!—'twere best.—'Tis fitter for a servant To know more than he utters.—That is wisdom. The. In troth I know not why you are afraid: You tremble:—yes, I see it in your countenance, You have done something to deserve correction, During my absence, as it seems. Epi. Nay, prithee! Can't you refrain from teizing me? The. I'm gone. Epi. Stay, I'll not let you go. The. Why do you hold me? Epi. Loves he the girl he purchas'd? The. What a question? He doats to death upon her. Epi. I shall have My skin stript off my back. The. He loves her more Than ever he lov'd you. Epi. Now, Jove confound you! The. Now, prithee let me go: for he has charg'd me Not to go home, but to our neighbours here, To Chæribulus; bad me wait him there: Himself is coming thither. Epi. For what reason? The. I'll tell you.—He'd not see, nor meet his father, Till he has paid the money, that he owes, For purchasing this girl. Epi. An ugly business! The. Dismiss me now, that I may hence directly. Epi. When the old gentleman shall know of this Our bark is fairly cast away. The. What matter Is it to me what death you die? Epi. I'm loath To die alone; I'd have you perish with me, Friend with his friend. The. Go hang yourself With this your rare proposal. Epi. Do thou go for me, If thou art in such hast. The. I never met A man I parted with so willingly. [Exit. Epi. He's gone: and now thou art alone: thou see'st What situation things are in, Epidicus: Unless thou find assistance in thyself, 'Tis over with thee: such destructive ruins Hang o'er thee, if thou dost not prop them firmly, Thou can'st not stand; such mountains of distress Threaten at once to tumble down upon thee. Nor can I hit on any likely scheme To extricate myself from my embarassment. A luckless rascal! by my artifices I have prevail'd on our old gentleman, To think that he has purchas'd his own daughter: When all the while, 'tis but a musick-girl, Whom his son lov'd; and order'd me to buy At his departure. Our young chap, forsooth! Has brought with him another from the army, Who struck his fancy. I am flead already. For when the old gentleman shall come to know That I have play'd him tricks, he'll smooth my back, He'll polish it with twigs—Then look about thee, That's nothing. [considering.] Psha, this pate of mine's quite addled. Thou art a fool, Epidicus. [speaking to himself.] But what [in another tone.] Provokes thee to call names, good friend?—Because Thou dost desert thyself.—What can I do?— What?—Do you ask me, you, who heretofore Were won't to lend advice to others?—What?— What?—something must be found.—But I am slow In meeting my young spark, that I may learn How matters are.—O, here he is, quite grave, He's walking with his year's mate Chæribulus. I'll step aside, and listen to their talk. [retires. SCENE II. Enter STRATIPPOCLES and CHÆRIBULUS. Stra. I've told you the whole story, Chæribulus, Giv'n you the sum both of my griefs and loves. Chæ. You are a fool, Stratippocles, beyond Your age and courage. Are you then asham'd, That you have bought a captive from the spoil, Of a good family? who is there, that Will blame you for it? Stra. By this deed, I've found All those my enemies that envy me: Yet have I never offer'd violence, Or stain to her fair chastity. Chæ. In this You, in my judgment, shew yourself most honest: Since you maintain a temperance in love. Stra. The man that comforts a desponding friend With words alone, does nothing. He's a friend Indeed, who proves himself a friend in need. Chæ. What would you have me do to serve you? Stra. This. Lend forty minæ, to repay the banker, Of whom I took them up at interest. Chæ. 'Troth! if I had them, I would not deny you. Stra. What signifies beneficence in words, If you are cold to help me in reality? Chæ. Nay, but myself am teiz'd to death; with duns Am torn to pieces. Stra. I had rather see Such friends at bottom of the sea. But now, Now would I buy the assistance of Epidicus E'en at a precious price. I'll send the rascal To the back-kneaders, and well work'd with yeast, If he procure not for me forty minæ E're the last syllable be spoke.—the money. Epi. [aside.] All's well! his promises are fair. I hope He'll keep them too. [ironically.] At no expence of mine My shoulders will be treated.—I'll accost him. [Going up to Stratippocles.] Epidicus, your slave, Sir, greets you well On your arrival from abroad. Stra. Where is he? Epi. Here.—I rejoice, Sir, at your safe arrival. Stra. I do believe you, even as myself. Epi. Have you been well in health, Sir? Stra. Well in body, But sick in mind. Epi. All that belong'd to me, I've taken care of; what you order'd me I've done; purchas'd the maiden, as you often Urg'd me by letter. Stra. You have lost your labour. Epi. How, wherefore have I lost it? Stra. For she is not Dear to my heart; nor do I like her. Epi. Why, then Was you so pressing in your charges? Why Write me so oft? Stra. I lov'd her heretofore, But now my heart's engag'd another way. Epi. How grievous is it to find a man ungrateful When you have serv'd him?—Thus by a good turn It seems I've done an evil one—'Cause your love Has shifted sides now. Stra. When I sent those letters I was not in my senses. Epi. And must I Atone then for your folly? Shall my back Be offer'd up a second victim for it? Chæ. What signifies this prate? Our youth hath need Of forty minæ piping hot, directly, Which you must pay, and quickly, to the banker. Epi. Where would you have me take it up? what banker Must I apply to? Stra. Where you please: but if You get it not e'er the sun set, my doors You shall not enter, but away to the workhouse. Epi. 'Tis easy talking with a heart at ease, Sans care or danger: but I knew our folks: And when I'm thrash'd, it pains me. Stra. Prithee! now, Wilt let me kill myself? Epi. No, do not that. Rather than so, I'll put me to the hazard, And buckle to the daring. Stra. Now thou lik'st me. Now I commend thee. Epi. I will undergo Whate'er you'd have me. Stra. So.—This musick-girl Which you have bought, what's to be done with her? Epi. Something shall be found out, some way or other I'll disengage, I'll extricate me some how. Stra. Thou hast a pregnant wit: I know thee well. Epi. There is a captain of Euboa, rich And strong in cash; who, when he comes to know That you've bought this, and brought that other home, Will press you straight, to make this over to him. But where's that other? Stra. She shall be forthcoming. Chæ. What's to be done, now? Stra. We will to your house And have a pleasant day of't. Epi. Get you in there. [Exit Stratippocles. Epi. Now will I call a council in my breast On ways and means, and ponder against whom To declare war, and raise the money.—Mind What you're about, Epidicus, the business Is put upon you hastily: the time Is not for sleep, nor yet delay—but daring— The project is resolv'd on.—I'll attack This same old fellow—Go, go, get you in. [to Chærubulus.] And caution our young Sir, to keep within doors, Lest he should chance to light upon his father. [Exit. End of the First Act.</field>

APŒCIDES. It is the way with most men: they're asham'd Without occasion: when they should be so, Then shame deserts them. Such a man are you. What need you be asham'd to take for wife One of good family, though her state be mean? The less, since, as you say, you have at home, A daughter by her— Per. I respect my son. Apoe. In troth I thought, your shame was on account Of your last wife; whose grave you never see, But straight you make a sacrifice to Pluto— Nor without reason, since you had the luck To outlive the vixen! Per. O, while she was with me, I was an Hercules; and his sixth labour Was not more hard than that which I endur'd. Per. Money's the best endowment.—Come— Apoe. I grant you, Could one but have it snug, without the wife. SCENE II. Enter EPIDICUS, [crossing the stage to the door of Chæribulus's house. Epi. Hist! silence! be of good heart: Out I go [speaking to Stratippocles and Chæribulus within.] With most auspicious omen.—I have somewhat here, [pointing to his head.] Sharp as a knife, with which I will embowel The old man's purse.—But lo! I see him at Apœcides's door—Both the old fellows Just as I wanted. Now will I convert me Into a leach, and suck their very blood out. These pillars of the senate! Apoe. [to Periphanes] Marry him Forthwith. Per. I like your counsel. Apoe. For I've heard His heart is fix'd upon a musick-girl, I know not whom. Per. That, that is torture to me. Epi. [aside.] I'm help'd, promoted, lov'd by all the gods! These Dons here ope themselves a passage for me To trick them fairly of their money.—Come, Attire thy self, and o'er thy shoulders throw Thy cloak, Epidicus: and so pretend Thou hast been searching him thro' all the town. About it straight. [aloud.] Good gods! would I could find Periphanes at home! I'm tir'd to death In looking for him the whole city over. At all the bankers, shambles, and perfumers, At 'pothecaries, and at barbers shops, The wrestling place, the forum,—I am hoarse With asking for him, and could hardly keep My legs, I made such speed.— Per. Epidicus! Epi. Who calls Epidicus? Per. I am Periphanes. Apoe. I am Apoecides. Epi. And I'm Epidicus— Oh! master! I am glad I see you both; You're come most opportunely. Per. What's the matter? Epi. Stay, prithee let me breath. Per. Well, rest yourself. Epi. I'm sick at heart—let me recover breath. Per. Keep yourself still. Epi. Now mind me.—All the troops Order'd to Thebes have been remanded home. Apoe. Who knows it to be so? Epi. I say, 'tis so. Per. You know? Epi. I know it. Per. How d'you know? Epi. Because I saw the soldiers march along the streets In shoals with their accoutrements and baggage. Per. That's excellent! Epi. Then what a croud of captives They bring with them: boys, girls, some two, some three, And others five a-piece: the streets are throng'd, Each person looking out to find his son. Per. A brave exploit, by Hercules! Here ends all that was translated by the late Bonnell Thornton, Esq; Epi. The tribe Of courtezans, scarce one left in the town, Appear'd in all their finery, to meet Their lovers, eagerly to run to them— And what I chiefly minded, many of them Had nets beneath their garments. At the port When I arriv'd, and saw her waiting there, And four musicians with her— Per. Her? with whom? Epi. Her whom your son has so much been in love with These many years, is dying for; with whom He's in fair way, to ruin his estate, His honour, nay himself and you. 'Tis true. Why, she was waiting for him at the port. Per. See the inchantress! Epi. She was dress'd! all o'er Bedaub'd with gold, so modish, smart and new— Per. How was she dress'd, then, say? Had she a train Sweeping the ground behind her as she walk'd, Just like a princess in a tragedy. Or was't a robe, perhaps a sack; they have Different attire, and known by all these names. Epi. A woman bear a sack upon her back! That's like a porter? Per. Well, and where's the wonder? There's many bear large farms upon their backs, And make it easy to them. Their gallants, When taxes become due, and are demanded, Have not wherewith to pay them; and yet find Enough to pamper their extravagance; A larger tax by far. And then what names! New ones each year, by which to call their garments! Your stiffen'd gown, your gown without a lining, White linnen gown, embroider'd upper gown, Your night-gown too, your gown of saffron colour, Your gown of marygold! and then your petticoats! Your upper, and your under petticoat, Your hood, your royal or your foreign robe, Your robe sky-colour'd, or stuck o'er with feathers, Your yellow, or your apple-blossom robe! Trifles indeed! They've too, transparent gowns, To these they give like names they give their dogs. Epi. How! dogs! Per. Yes, dogs; they call them their Laconicks. Just as they call their dogs from Lacedæmon. These names breed auctions—Their gallants must feed them.— But on now with your tale. Epi. Two other women I heard behind me, talking to each other Something to this effect: when I, us'd so to do, Drew back a little way, and made as if I took no note at all of what they said. 'Tis true, I heard not every word; but yet I heard enough, to let me fairly into The drift they aim'd at.— Per. That's what I would know. Epi. Said one to t'other— Per. What? Epi. Be silent! Peace— You'll hear it all.—Soon as they'd cast their eyes Upon the girl, that your son loves, says one, What luck that creature's had, to meet a man, Who loves her so, that he will set her free! Who's he? says t'other—then she nam'd Stratippocles, Periphanes' son— Pal. You're broad awake. Phæ. I sleep as I was wont—This is my sleep. Pal. Let me then tell you, 'tis imprudence, Lady, To treat him ill, who has not deserv'd it of you. Pla. You would be angry, if when you're at supper He were to drive you from it— Pal. All is over: They both love to distraction, both are mad. See, how they hug! They'll never have enough. Won't you part yet? Pla. No blessing lasts for ever— That plague is ever to our pleasure join'd. [looking angrily at Palinurus. Pal. What say you, baggage—What, you little toss-pot, With those grey eyes, that see best in the dark; Trifler, am I your plague? Phæ. A slave! abuse My Venus here! A beaten drudge to talk To me! But you shall sore repent your prate. Come here—take that for your abuse. [strikes him.] Now try, If you can hold your tongue. Pal. Assist me now, Night-watching Venus! Phæ. What! persist, you rascal? Pla. Desist, my love—'Tis striking at a stone. Bruise not your hand against it then— Pal. Why, Phædromus, In a flagitious and a shameful act You bear her out. The man that gives you counsel You beat; and her you love. 'Tis trifling all. Is't right to assume the manners of the stews? Phæ. I bet my gold against your modest lover: Here, take my purse. Pal. No, rather give me copper, So I may serve a master in his senses. Pla. Adieu! my dear. I hear the noise and creak Of doors: The priest is opening the temple. Epi. Well—I saw one just come from him, Who told me, he'd be here to morrow morning. Per. Go on then, tell us what we've next to do? Epi. Why this; pretend you gave this girl her freedom, Of your mere will, as loving her yourself.— Per. What good will come of that? Epi. What good? You'll purchase her before your son comes back, And say, your reason was, to make her free. Per. I understand you. Epi. And, the purchase made, You'll pack her off, some distance from the town; Unless you've wiser thought— Per. I think, you're right. Epi. And what think you? [to Apœcides.] Apoe. Why, what else should I think? An excellent contrivance, this you've thought of. Epi. Thus you'll defeat your son's whole scheme of marrying her, And render him obedient to your will. Apoe. Thou art a cunning fellow, and I like thee. Epi. [to Periphanes.] What then you have to do, do quickly, Sir. Per. By Hercules! the very thing. Epi. I've hit on A scheme too, that you'll never be suspected To be the party. Per. Let us hear. Epi. You shall— Attend then. Apoe. [aside.] 'Tis the cunning'st of all fellows. Epi. We want a trusty person, to convey The money for this musick girl; 'twill not Look well, to have you seen in it yourself. Per. Why?— Epi. Lest the merchant think 'tis for your son. Per. That's right— Epi. By which you'll keep her off, and hinder All mischief which might rise from that suspicion— Per. Whom shall we find so fit— Epi. Why, who more fit Than this your friend here? [meaning Apœcides.] He can take good care, All's right and regular.—He knows the law.— Per. You have my thanks, Epidicus. Epi. But I Must lose no time—I'll first go meet the merchant, Carry the money with this gentleman, And bring the girl along with me. Per. But say, What is the lowest price he'll fell her at. Epi. Perhaps you'll get her for—for forty minæ, But if you give me more, I shall return it: You can't suspect a trick in't. And I'm sure, You'll have your money back within ten days. Per. How so? Epi. Why, there's another spark in love with her, One plaguy rich, a great and famous captain, A Rhodian, one that's become rich by plunder— A braggard: he will take her off your hands, And without scruple, pay you down the money. Hold but your peace, you'll be a gainer by it.— Per. Pray heaven, I may!— Epi. 'Twill doubtless be the case. Apoe. Go in then, Sir, and bring me out the money. I'll to the Forum. You, Epidicus, Be sure, come to me there. Epi. Do you be sure, You stay there 'till I come. Apoe. I'll stay there for you. [Exit Apœcides. Per. [to Epidicus.] Follow me in. Epi. Go, and count out your money. You shall not wait for me, I'll warrant you— [Exit Periphanes. EPIDICUS alone. I do not think, that in all Attick land, There can be found a piece of ground so fertile As our Periphanes. Tho' lock'd and seal'd, I shake his box, and rook him as I please. Should the old fellow find me out, I fear, He'd turn his elm twigs into parasites, Who'll lick me to the bone.—But one thing puzzles me, What hired girl to shew Apœcides— That too I've hit on—For this very morning Th'old man bid me bring him home a musick-girl To sing, while he perform'd his sacrifice. One shall be hir'd, and instructed well How to behave in carrying on the cheat— I'll in, and take the money of the gull. [Exit after Periphanes. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter STRATIPPOCLES and CHÆRIBULUS. STRATIPPOCLES. I grieve and fret my heart out, waiting how Epidicus's promises will end— In any thing, or nothing, I'd fain know— Chæ. 'Tis my opinion, you seek aid elsewhere— I from the first, knew you'd have none from him. Stra. Undone! undone! Chæ. Consider how absurd Thus to torment yourself— Stra. By Hercules! If I but once can catch him, he shall know A slave shall never trick us unreveng'd— What can he do, when you, who have at home Money to spare, will not assist your friend. Chæ. Had I the money, I would promise freely— In troth I would—But it is odds that something— Something—will happen—something in some manner— From some place—or some other—from some person— And you may have some hope—to share with me In my good fortune.— Stra. You're a sneaking fellow— Fie, fie upon you!— Chæ. Why to me this language! Stra. Because you're prating to me about something— Some manner—from some place, and from some this— Some that,—some t'other body—And all this Nought to the purpose, nor do I attend to't— Nor from this time shall I e'er more expect From you assistance, than from one not born.— SCENE II. Enter EPIDICUS, [from Periphanes's house with a bag of money. Epi. You've done your duty; mine remains to do.— [to Periphanes within.] This care of mine may lighten you of yours. You hope the loss may bring some good to you. How bright the pieces are!—Trust it to me— Thus still act I—as did my ancestors. Gods! what a lucky day have you bestow'd! How easy, how unlook'd for! But I wast The time, while this supply I should be bearing In safety to our colony.—What's here? Two friends before the house!—It is my master, And Chæribulus—What now?—Take the bag— [to Stratippocles. Stra. What sum does it contain? Epi. Enough and more. I've brought ten minæ more than what you owe The banker—while I can in this oblige, I value not my back a rush.— Stra. How so? Epi. I'll make your father guilty of bag-slaughter— Stra. Your meaning?— Epi. I mind not your common forms; Be you content to lead him by the nose, And pick his pockets, while I pick his bags! The pandar, [coming forward] Sir, has swallow'd the whole sum For this same girl, your father deems his daughter. 'Tis paid—I told the money with these hands— Nay, more—To cheat your father, and help you, I've had some talk with, and persuaded him To take effectual care, at your return, To hinder you from getting at the girl, “By buying her before-hand for himself, “And pack her off into some private corner. “Now will I top another girl upon him, “And she will serve him every jot as well. Stra. Well done! Epi. She'll be directly at your house And pass there for your mistress.— Stra. Oh! I take you— Epi. Your father too has spoken to Apœcides To take it on himself, and seem the purchaser; And he's now waiting for me at the Forum. Stra. That's well. Epi. The biter's bit tho', after all. He has put the purse into my hands himself, And he's at home preparing for your wedding [to him.] As soon as you arrive. Stra. On one condition, And only one, will I consent to that. The death of the dear girl, I brought home with me. Epi. One more device, I've still behind—I'll go In private to the pandar's house, and tell him, If ask'd the price o'th'musick-girl, to say, 'Twas fifty minæ.—That's the very sum I paid him three days since with my own hands, For t'other girl, your father thinks his daughter. On which, he'll wish destruction on his head, If 'twas not for the girl you brought home with you, He had the money. Stra. Subtlety itself!— Epi. Now will I hire some cunning musick-girl Who shall pretend to be the party purchas'd, And well instructed, play on the old men. As such she shall be sent unto Apœcides, To carry to your father.— Stra. Well contriv'd— Epi. And thus prepar'd, and laden with my tricks, I'll send her straight—But I prate here too long, And you too long have waited—What's to come You know.—I'm gone.— Stra. Go, and success attend you! [Exit Epidicus. Chæ. A subtle dog at mischief! Stra. Sure I am His shrewd advice has been my preservation.— Chæ. Then let us to my house— Stra. And better pleas'd Than when we sallied thence—I, by the courage And conduct of Epidicus, return Laden with spoils and plunder to the camp. [Exeunt into Chæribulus's house. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter PERIPHANES. PERIPHANES. 'Twere right a man should hold a mirror up Not only to his face, but to his mind; And see the very heart of his discretion. Whence he might judge its power and extent. Consult that glass, and think what life you led When young yourself, Periphanes—I, who Thus fret and teaze my heart out, on my son's Account, I now experienc'd, feel myself, My own misdeeds in youth stronger than his. But truth it is, we old folks sometimes doat; And such a mirror would be useful to us. But see my friend Apœcides; and with him The prize my son has purchas'd. SCENE II. Enter APOECIDES, with a musick-girl. —Welcome back, My merchant, I am glad to see you safe Return'd. What say you? Apoe. That the Heavens smile Propitious on you.— Per. 'Tis a lucky omen. Apoe. All things succeed as well as we could wish. But order some one to conduct the girl Into the house. Per. Hola! who waits there? One of you Come hither. Enter a Servant. —Shew this girl into the house. And, do you hear— Serv. Your pleasure, Sir? Per. Take care You suffer not my daughter and this girl To meet together, nor to see each other. Mark me—I'd have her lock'd i'the little room Alone. The manners of a modest virgin Are widely distant from a common harlot's.— [Exit Servant, with the Musick-Girl. Apoe. Spoke like a man of sense. No man can be Too careful of his daughter's honour. Troth, We nick'd the time in snapping up this girl, Before your son could purchase her. Per. How so? Apoe. Because a person told me, that e'en now He saw your son here— Per. Like enough, in troth! And ready for his bargain. Apoe. Plainly so, 'Troth you've a servant fit to be enroll'd; One worth his weight in gold—Nor is he dear At gold so weigh'd—How finely he play'd off The musick-girl, that she suspected not The purchase made for you! with what a smile He brought her laughing hither! Per. I'm amaz'd How he could do it! Apoe. Under a pretence That you'd a sacrifice to make at home For your son's safety, just arriv'd from Thebes. Per. An excellent contrivance, that!— Apoe. And then, The reason why he brought her thither, was To assist you in performing it—He said You had a sacrifice to make—While I Look'd silly all the time; and made myself A very ideot. Per. Right— Apoe. A friend of mine Has an affair of consequence, depending Now at the Forum—And I must away To stand his advocate. Per. Go—and return Soon as that's o'er— Apoe. I'll not be absent long. [Exit Apoecides. Per. A friend in need, is sure a friend indeed. Whate'er you wish, is done without your trouble. Now had I trusted this affair to one Less vers'd in tricks, I had been finely fob'd; Then had my son shewn his white teeth with justice. What folly 'tis in me, to blame in him, The follies of my youth!—When in the army, I split the ears of all that I could seize on, With bragging of my feats—But who is this Comes tossing on; waving his cloak in air? [seeing the Captain of Rhodes at a distance. SCENE III. Enter a Captain of Rhodes. Capt. See that you pass no house, but ask at all [to a servant.] Where old Periphanes of Platea lives. And take good care you come not back to me, Before you've found him out. Per. Suppose, my youth, I should inform you of the man you seek, What thanks should I deserve? Capt. Brave as I've been In war, my merits there have giv'n me right To expect that every man should give me thanks. Per. Young man, you've not found out a proper place, To brag of your atchievements. An inferior, When he attempts to publish his exploits Before his betters, does but foul his mouth. But if you seek Periphanes of Platea, I am the man, if you want ought with me. Capt. Are you the man, that in his youth, 'tis said, Was spoke of before kings; and by his arms, And soldier-like accomplishments, acquir'd An ample fortune? Per. I, Sir, am the man; And if you was to hear all my atchievements, You'd drop your hands, and hie you home with speed— Capt. By Pollux! I had rather find the man To tell my own atchievements to, than one To tell me his. Per. This is no proper place. Find some one else to tell your nonsense to. Capt. List to me then, and you shall know my errand— I hear you've made a purchase of my mistress. Per. [aside.] O ho! I now begin to know my spark! The very captain that Epidicus Had told me of. 'Tis very true, young man, [to him.] I made the purchase. Capt. I'd have a word or two, If't be not troublesome— Per. I can't tell that. Speak as you will, it shall not trouble me. Capt. Then let me have her; I'll pay down the money. Per. Take her.— Capt. No need with you to mince the matter. I think this day to give the girl her freedom, And take her for my bed-fellow.— Per. In short, I purchas'd her at fifty silver minæ; Count me down sixty, and the girl is yours Long as your furlow lasts—On this condition You rid the country of her. Capt. Is she mine? Per. Upon those terms she is. Capt. You sell a bargain. Per. [to his servants.] Who's there?—send out to us the musick-girl, You carried in but now.—[to him.] I'll give you too, Her lute into the bargain—and her trumpery. Enter Servants with a Musick-Girl. There, take her, friend.— [giving her to the captain.] Capt. What madness has possess'd you? What, would you blind my eyes? the girl within— Order her forth— Per. This is the girl I bought. There is no other here.— Capt. No tricks with me! Produce the musick-girl Acropolistis. Per. Why, this is she— Capt. I tell you, 'tis not she. Think you I know not my own mistress? What!— Per. I tell you, this is she my son was fond of. Capt. 'Tis not the same. Per. What? not the same? Capt. 'Tis not. Per. Whence came she then? By Hercules! I swear, This is the girl I gave the money for. Capt. You fool'd your money then away, and made A plaguy blunder. Per. Out of doubt, 'tis she. I sent my servant: one who usually Attends upon my son; he made the purchase. Capt. This servant then has fairly bubbled you. Per. How bubbled me? Capt. Nothing: 'tis but suspicion. This wench is put upon you for the musick-girl, You're plainly, palpably impos'd upon.— Per. I'll find her out where'er she is: and so, My man of war, adieu!—Well done, Epidicus! [Exit Captain. A clever fellow!—Bravely done, my man! You've finely wip'd my nose.—[to the girl.] Did not Apœcides Buy thee this very day of the slave merchant! Mus. Girl. Ne'er till this day heard I of such a man: Nor could he purchase me at any rate Who have been five years free. Per. What business here, then? Mus. Girl. Here I was hir'd to sing and play the lute, While an old gentleman perform'd a sacrifice. Per. There's not a greater ideot than myself; No not in Athens.—But you know the musick-girl Acropolistis? Mus. Girl. As I know myself. Per. Where lives she? Mus. Girl. Since her freedom I'm not sure. Per. Freedom!—And who gave her her freedom, pray? Mus. Girl. I'll tell you what I've heard; 'twas that Stratippocles, Periphanes's son, who in his absence Took care to get her freedom. Per. If 'tis true, I am undone, by Hercules!—Epidicus 'Tis very plain, has squeez'd my purse most finely. Mus. Girl. By what I hear, you will no more with me. Per. No more, but death with torture, and your absence. Mus. Girl. You'll let me take my lute?— Per. Nor lute, nor flute— Hast, if the gods will let you, fly. Mus. Girl. I go: But you'll repent this usage some time hence.— [Exit Musick Girl. Per. What's to be done? Shall I, who've had my name Before so many edicts, let this rascal Go off unpunish'd—No—tho' I should lose As much again, I'd rather, than to bear To be thus laugh'd at, plunder'd, unreveng'd. Yes, I'm expos'd.—Yet I'm a fool indeed, To have a worse opinion of myself Than this Apœcides, who brags of being A law-maker so famous—He is still Boasting his wisdom—But, I'd have him know, The hammer is no wiser than the handle. SCENE IV. Enter PHILIPPA at a distance. Phi. If man in all his misery's to be pitied, 'Tis when the malady is in his mind. This I experience in all shapes of ill. Fear, poverty alarm my inmost mind, Nor find I, for the little hope I've left A place of safety.—I have lost my daughter To th'enemy—Nor know I where to seek her. Per. [aside.] What woman's this?—A stranger, full of fears Who thus bewails herself? Phi. They said, Periphanes Liv'd somewhere hereabout— Per. [aside.] She mentions me. Perhaps she wants some hospitable friend. Phi. Would any one shew me the man, or where He lives, I would reward him for't— Per. [aside.] For certain I know this woman: I have seen her face, Tho' where I know not—Is it she or no? My mind suspects 'tis she— Phi. [seeing him.] O ye good gods! He is familiar to me.— Per. [aside.] I've no doubt, 'Tis the poor woman, whom in Epidaurus I well remember to have had— Phi. 'Tis he, Who first enjoy'd my love in Epidaurus— Per. [aside.] By whom I had a daughter now at home.— Phi. Say, I approach him— Per. [aside.] Shall I then accost her, Or no?—If 'tis the same— Phi. O, should it be The man, as length of time has made it doubtful— Per. [aside.] 'Tis so long since, my mind is at a loss. But if 'tis she, I'll artfully address her. Phi. Come to my aid some of my sex's arts! Per. [aside.] I'll speak to her— Phi. I'll have some talk with him. Per. [to her.] Mistress, good day!— Phi. Thanks, both for me and mine. Per. What more? Phi. Good day!—Your compliment's return'd. Per. For your just dealing, thanks—Do I not know you? Phi. If I am not mistaken, I've to say That which will call me well to your remembrance.— Per. Where have I seen you? Phi. That's too hard a question. Per. Why so? Phi. You'd have me prompt your memory. Per. You'd tell fine stories— Phi. Your's were wonders all. Per. And do you recollect that better? Phi. Oh! I do. Per. In Epidaurus— Phi. Ah! that word, That word, a little drop of healing comfort, Has cool'd the burning heat within my bosom.— Per. My taking pity on your mother's poverty, Relieving her, and you, a helpless girl— Phi. Are you the man, who by deceiving me, Have plung'd me into all this misery? Per. The very man—Good day!—You have your health! Phi. The better, that I see you well. Per. Your hand— Phi. Take it—You've here a woman full of misery.— Per. Why so concern'd? Phi. The daughter I had by you— Per. Well, what of her? Phi. When I had brought her up, I lost her. She's a prisoner 'mongst the enemy. Per. Be easy then, and set your heart at rest: Behold, within the house, she's safe and well. As soon as e'er my slave told me her fate, I purchas'd her; in that affair the fellow Acquitted him with diligence, and prudence; As in all else, he has been a very rascal. Phi. O let me see her, if you'd have me live! Per. Hola! who waits there? Canthara, go bid My daughter instantly come out to me, That she may see her mother. Phi. This revives me! SCENE V. Enter the MUSICK-GIRL. Mus. Girl. Your pleasure, father: why am I call'd forth? Per. To see thy mother, child—Go, get thee to her, And meet her with a kiss— Mus. Girl. What mother, Sir? Per. She there, that's dying for the sight of you. Phi. Who's this, you'd have to kiss me? Per. Who?—your daughter. Phi. Who?—This?— Per. The same. Phi. What! kiss this creature, say you? Per. And why not kiss her? Is she not your daughter? Phi. The man's distracted. Per. I, distracted? Phi. You. Per. Why so? Phi. Because I know not who she is; Have no acquaintance with her, nor so much As e'er set eyes on her, before this instant. Per. I see from whence arises your mistake; She has chang'd her dress and put on other cloaths. Phi. Kittens and pigs smell very different, I neither know this girl, nor whence she is. Per. Gods! how is this? what! do I keep a brothel To harbour strangers, and maintain them there? Why did you call me father, and why kiss me? Why stand there like a block? Why speak'st thou not? Mus. Girl. What would you have me say? Per. This woman says, She's not your mother. Mus. Girl. If she's not—why, be it so. In spite of her, I'll be my mother's daughter. It is not fair to force her to be such Against her will.— Per. Why then did'st call me father? Mus. Girl. The fault was yours, not mine—I never call'd You father once, till you had call'd me daughter. And should she call me so, I'd call her mother. As she denies me, she's no more a mother— No fault of mine—I said, as I was taught. Epidicus was my instructor— Per. How! Undone! undone!—I'm ruin'd horse and foot. Mus. Girl. Am I to blame? Per. If e'er you call me father, By Hercules! your life shall answer for it. Mus. Girl. Well, I'll not call you father—when you please, To be my father—so—when not—why, choose— Phi. What! did you buy her, thinking her your daughter? What tokens had you to believe her such? Per. Troth, none at all. Phi. What was't then made you think so? Per. Epidicus my servant told me so. Phi. So, were your servant of another mind, You knew her not yourself? Per. How should I know her, That saw her but one time—and never after. Phi. Wretch, that I am! Per. Weep not, I say, but in.— Have a good heart. I'll find her out, I'll warrant. Phi. A citizen of Athens purchas'd her; A young man too, they say. Per. Be you but satisfied, I'll find her out. Mean time, go in, and watch This Circe here, this daughter of the sun. [Exit Philippa into the house. All other business I'll at once postpone, And go in search of this Epidicus: Whom if I find, this day shall be his last. [Exit. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter STRATIPPOCLES. How ill this banker here obeys my orders! Who nor demands his money, nor brings home The girl, I purchas'd from the spoils.—But see! Epidicus!—Why are his brows so purs'd! Enter EPIDICUS, at a distance. Epi. [aside.] Should Jove himself, with his eleven Gods Come to his aid, they could not save Epidicus, From condign punishment. I saw Periphanes Buying of manacles: Apœcides Was with him; and they're now, I take for granted, In search of me. They've smelt me out, and know I have impos'd upon them— Stra. Ho! how fares My useful rascal, my commodity? Epi. As well as such a wretch as I am, can. Stra. Why, what's the matter? Epi. Prithee now equip me With necessaries for a march, before I'm quite undone. E'en now, the two old fellows, Whom I've been fleecing, are in search of me, With manacles a full half inch in breadth. Stra. Have a good heart. Epi. And, wherefore should I not, When I'm so sure my liberty's at hand—[ironically.] Stra. Well, I'll take care of you. Epi. By Pollux temple! These two old fellows will take better care, If once they catch me. But, what girl is that; And who that red-hair'd fellow that is with her? [seeing the Banker and the Musick-Girl at a distance. Stra. O, 'tis the banker: and with him, the girl I purchas'd from the spoils. Epi. What! is that she? Stra. The same. Is she not all I said? observe her. Epi. Is't she indeed! Stra. But mark her well, Epidicus; From top to toe she is a paragon. Is she not? say. Consider, view her well. There's painting for you! Epi. Yes, you are foretelling A pretty piece of painting on my back, Which our old Zeuxes and Apelles there, [meaning Periphanes and Apoecides. With their elm pencils—will delineate— SCENE II. Enter the BANKER, and TELESTIS. Stra. [to the Banker.] How tedious you have been? why sure, a fellow With his feet swell'd, would have been sooner here. Ban. By Pollux' temple, she it was detain'd me. Stra. Nay, if you staid on her account, if she Would have it so, why, you are come too soon. Ban. Come, come, dispatch me, and count out the money, That I may not detain my company. Stra. 'Tis counted out already. Ban. Take this bag, And put it in it. Stra. Wisely done! Stay here, I'll fetch it strait. Ban. Quick, then— Stra. 'Tis here at home. [Exit. Epi. Have I the right use of my eyes, or no? Do I not see Telestis there, the daughter Of old Periphanes, and of Philippa The Theban, who was bred at Epidaurus? Tel. Who are you, say, that call me by my name, My parents too by theirs? Epi. Don't you then know me? Tel. Not as I recollect. Epi. What, not remember, I brought you on your birth-day, a gold toy, A crescent, and a gold ring for your finger? Tel. I do remember. Was it you then, friend? Epi. I am the man; and there's your brother: both [pointing to Stratippocles. Own the same father, but another mother. Tel. What, is my father then alive? Epi. He is. Compose yourself, and hold your peace. Tel. The gods, Should this be true, have sav'd me from perdition. Epi. I have no interest in deceiving you. Enter STRATIPPOCLES from the house. Stra. Here, take your money; 'tis just forty minæ. [to the banker. If there are any bad, I'll change them for you. Bank. 'Tis very well—adieu, Sir.— [Exit Banker. Stra. Now, my girl, You're mine. [to Telestis.] Tel. Yes, your's indeed. I am your sister. Brother, well met! Stra. Has she her senses? Epi. Yes: And sense enough, if she calls you her brother. Stra. I did but just step in and out again; And in a trice am I become her brother? Epi. Keep your good fortune to yourself: be silent. Stra. You've lost me, sister, lost as well as found me. Epi. Say not a word, you fool! By my contrivance, The musick girl you love, waits you at home; And I have freed your sister. Stra. True, Epidicus, I own it. Epi. In then, order a warm bath: I'll tell you all the rest at leisure. Stra. Sister, Follow me in. Epi. [to Stratippocles.] I'll send out Thesprio to you. But you'll remember, should the old man rave, You and your sister are to stand my friends— Stra. That's a request will easily be granted— [Exit Stratippocles with Telestis. Epi. Thesprio, do you go round the garden way, And when I'm in the house, besure assist me. Great matters are in hand.—Th'old folks, methinks Are not so dreadful as but now.—I'll in; Prepare me for our guests; and tell Stratippocles The whole I know, within—I'll not abscond; I'll stand my ground at home.—Nor shall he say, My feet have done him any injury. I'll enter.—I've stood talking here too long. [Going off: but seeing Periphanes and Apoecides entering, retires. SCENE III. Enter PERIPHANES and APŒCIDES. Per. Has not this fellow play'd his tricks sufficient On two such old, decrepid fools as we! Apoe. Yes, troth! you too have plagu'd me not a little. Per. 'St! 'st! say nothing: but let me alone To find the fellow out. Apoe. You'd beter find A fit companion for you in this business; My legs are swell'd in keeping pace with you. Per. How oft has he this day made us two fools! How has he drain'd the bottom of my purse? Apoe. Plague on this son of Vulcan! in his wrath He burns whate'er he touches: stand but near him, He'll scorch you with his heat. Epi. [apart.] I have twelve Gods, More than there are in heaven, to assist me, And fight upon my side. I've that at home, Will stand my friend, and amply make atonement. I laugh at all my foes— Per. Where in the world Shall I go seek this rascal— Apoe. In the bottom O'th'sea, you may go seek him out for me; So you insist not on my company.— Epi. [advancing.] Why look for me, Sir? Wherefore all these pains? Why plague your friend thus? Here, you see, I am. Have I attempted, Sir, to run away? To leave the house, or hide me from your presence? I ask no pardon. Is it, Sir, your pleasure I should be hand-cuff'd? Here, Sir, are my hands. The thongs are ready; for I saw you buy them.— What is't you wait for? bind me instantly. Per. The affair's all over—Of his own accord He comes, and wants no bail for his appearance. Epi. Why don't you bind my hands, and tye them fast? Per. By Pollux temple! an ungracious slave. Epi. And as for you, Apœcides, I want not [ironically.] You for my advocate.— Apoe. You easily Prevail on me to be excus'd, Epidicus. Epi. Why do you not proceed? Per. Am I to execute Your will and pleasure? Epi. Yes, 'tis mine by Hercules! And not your own. These hands you're now to bind. Per. 'Tis not my pleasure. Epi. What! not have me bound? Per. I would examine you at liberty. Epi. You will get nothing out of me. Apoe. The fellow Is forging means, although we scent them not, To get your head again into his net.— Epi. You but lose time, while I'm at liberty. So instant tie my hands, and tie them hard. Per. I rather choose to examine you at liberty. Epi. You may—But you'll get nothing out of me. Per. [to Apoe.] What had I best to do? Apoe. What best to do?— Why, humour him I think. Epi. Worthy Apœcides! Per. Hold out your hands then? Epi. Ready. There they are. But bind them tight: Spare me not. Per. “There—Both of you, “Say, are they tight enough? Epi. “Yes, yes, they'll do. “Examine me, now ask me what you please.” Per. First then, how durst you say, with what assurance, The girl you purchas'd for me three days since, Was my own daughter? Epi. 'Twas my pleasure; there You have, Sir, my assurance. Per. What! your pleasure? Epi. My pleasure: and now lay me any wager That she is not a daughter. Per. When her mother Owns her not? Epi. That she's not her mother's daughter. Bet me your talent then against my sesterce. Per. That's all a sophistry. Who's this woman then? Epi. To tell you the whole truth, this woman is The mistress of your son. Per. And thirty minæ Did I not give you, say; to purchase her, Supposing her my daughter? Epi. Yes, you did. And with that very money did I purchase This musick-girl, the mistress of your son, And made her pass upon you for your daughter! For thirty minæ, Sir, I touch'd you there. Per. But why then top this other girl upon me? Epi. I have so done; and thought it right to do so. Per. But the last money that I gave you! say, What is become of that? Epi. I'll tell you, Sir. I gave it no bad man, nor yet to one Unworthy of you; to your son Stratippocles. Per. Why did you dare to give it him? Epi. Because It was my pleasure so to do. Per. You rascal! What impudence is this? Epi. I'm scolded at, As if I was your slave. Per. I should be glad To know you had your freedom. [ironically. Epi. I deserve To have it now. Per. Yes, you deserve it truly? Epi. Go, look within doors; there you'll quickly see How I've deserv'd it. Per. What d'you mean by this? Epi. The thing will speak itself—Go you but in. Per. He says not this without a meaning—You, [to Apoecides. Look to the fellow carefully. [Exit into the house. Apoe. Epidicus, What is this business? Epi. 'Tis unjust, by Hercules! That I should stand here bound, when by my means, He has this day discover'd a lost daughter. Apoe. What say you, that you've found his daughter? Epi. Yes. And she's at home too—But 'tis very hard, For my good deeds, to reap this evil harvest. Apoe. How have we toil'd in searching you today! Epi. I am fatigu'd with finding, you with seeking. Enter PERIPHANES, from the house. Per. [speaking to those within.] You need not press the thing so vehemently, I find he has well deserv'd; and I'll take care He shall not lose his recompence. Hold out [to Epidicus. Your hands, that I may loose them. Epi. Touch me not. Per. Hold them out then. Epi. Not I. Per. You are to blame. Epi. Not till you've given me proper punishment. Per. You ask no more than what is just and right. A pair of sandals, vest, and cloak are yours. Epi. What else? Per. Your freedom. Epi. Yes, and something more. A new made freedman should have wherewithal To pick a bit. Per. No more: it shall be done. I'll give you a meal's meat. Epi. By Hercules! You shan't unbind me, till you've ask'd my pardon. Per. If I unwittingly have done you wrong, Honest Epidicus, I ask your pardon— And so—I make you free— Epi. I pardon you— But 'tis against the grain—of pure necessity— Here are my hands, unbind them when you please.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The COMEDIANS. This is the man, who by his rogueries [pointing to Epidicus. Has gain'd his freedom—Give us your applause. Farewell. Rise from your seats, and stretch your limbs. End of The Discovery.</field>
