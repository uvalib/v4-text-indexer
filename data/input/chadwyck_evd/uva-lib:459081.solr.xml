      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primi Scena Prima. Enter, Bassaes Isaack with a Crowne in his hand, Mustapha with a Scepter, Mesithes with a Sword, they Crowne Corcutus youngest sonne to Baiazet. Isaack. Let the world feele thee, and those Demigods, Proud with the name of Kings, debase themselues To honour thee, this Crowne commands as much He crowns him. Wherewith I doe invest thy happy brow, Happy indeed if that succeeding times Shall set vp vertue, so to lessen crimes. Thus from the ashes of dead Solyman Is raised another PhÅnix great Corcutus; Liue equally adored, when Princes bend To better courses, all their subiects mend. Must. Crowns make not Kings, nor can that glittering shew Perfect thine honour, take another signe Giues him the Scepter. Of thy Imperiall dignity, 'tis thine. That addes a God-like grace vnto thy brow, This binds due honour, that prostrates euery knee Before thy throne, then liue, and may that arme Secure thy subiects from all forraigne harme. Mesith. What seasoned knowledge, learnings prudent Queen Hath blest thee with, must now initiate thee In the pathes of warre, all studied Arts Are but degrees vnto some wished end, And steps of hope whereby we doe ascend Vnto the top; and leuell of our thoughts. But Kings then proue most happy when they are Watchfull in peace, and prouident in warre. Those are their vtmost ends, which that they may O're-take, Art, and the sword, make fairest way. The Muses nourc'd thee vp, and thou didst draw The pleasant iuice of learning from their brests, In thy first non-age; here then we bestow The second helpe, to which good Princes owe Much of their welfare; swords are the first ground Of peace, and warre; they both defend and wound. Thus are we vow'd to thee, let thy dread fame Thunder amazement through the spatious world, That when thou lifts thine arme, thy foes may say Showts 3. Not Ioue, but great Corcutus rules the day. Corcut. Which that applause hath crowned, and with it Will euer spight of traytors ioying sit As now we doe; nor shall my watchfull care Be wanting to you, whilst this subtill ayre Feedes mine industrious spirits, I shall fill The good with ioy, by cutting of the ill Corrupted ragges of men; Ioue let me stand An obiect in thine eye, when thy swift hand Failes in the stroke of Iustice, vertue returne From thy sad exile, I will purge the walls From spotted vice, and make this Cittie free To entertaine so faire a Queene as shee. Then (Bassaes) I embrace what you haue throwne Vpon me, and these signes of honour thus Giues them backe. We re-bestow; their power still stayes with vs. Could this vast body of the Common-wealth Stand fast without a soule? each man should see I am not greedy of this dignity: This burdenous waight which some must vndergoe, The gods are busied with diuiner things, And put Earths care into the hands of Kings. Scena Secunda. After some clamors of applause Enter Chersogles, and Achmetes at seuerall doores. Achmet. And is Baiazet arriu'd? Chers. So fame reports Yet how he doth digest Corcutus Raigne, That euerie Bird sings not; but sure with paine. A Turkish Baiazet, and suffer wrong, May for a time conceale his griefe, not long. Eagles soare high, and scorne that shorter Plumes Should reach the cloudes, which their proud wings can touch, Corcutus must not raigne, to keepe his fathers right Due to his father, nor will he if he might, Eenter Isaack. Hee's learned, therefore iust, Arts not allow To were a Crowne due to anothers brow. Isa. Dar'st thou oppose his greatnesse? is not Greece Already wrackt enough? haue thy provd Towers Reard vp their loftie spires? which steep'd in blood, Threw a reflex of red backe to the clouds, And blush't at their owne ruines, are thy crude wounds Already stopt, and is that day forgot, In which the Turkish Mavors Ottoman, Wielded a sword of death within thy Walles? Charon grew weary with hurrying soules to hell, When threescore thousand Greekes in one day fell. Chers. We know their force, and sad experience sayes, Moue not againe, Greece welters still in blood And euery crackling thunder of the heauens Speakes the shrill eccho of the Turkish drummes, Then are we drawne by you, so let it bee, About these great affaires as you decree. Achm. This phrase becomes the Greekes, submissiue states Must bend, the Conqueror must rule the fates. Chers. And such are you, our vanquisht hearts must bend, But bad beginnings haue a fatall end, Me thinkes I see great Baiazet in armes, Spreading his fearefull Ensignes in the ayre, Like some prodigious Comet, wee may feare Speedy revenge vnlesse some quicke aduise Worke a prevention of his future hate, Tis he must sway the Scepter, or wee shall heare A dreadfull defiance ratled in our eare, Hees strong in friends, and power, vve must descend, To our iust dutie, or our latest end. Achm. Renowned Vice-roy, thy perswading thoughts Haue predeuin'd most truely these effects, And we applaud thy Counsell, let vs three Ioyne our best strength, that these ensuing jarres May be compos'd without the stroke of Warres: Corcute is wise, and milde, and being so, He hates the rumour of a publike foe. Chers. Nobly resolu'd (Greece sings) if the event, Proue but so happy, as honest the intent. But stand aside, Baiazet is come. Enter Baiazet. Baia. Am I not Emperor? hee that breaths a no, Damnes in that negative sillable his soule, Durst any god gain-say it, he should feele The strength of fiercest Gyants in mine armes, Mine angers at the highest, and I could shake The firme foundation of the earthly Globe: Could I but graspe the Poles in these two handes, I'de plucke the world asunder; droppe thou bright Sunne, From thy transparant Spheare, thy course is done, Great Baiazet is wrong'd, nor shall thine eye Be witnesse to my hatefull misery. Madnesse and anger makes my tongue betray, The Chaos of my thoughts: vnder this brest, An heape of indigested cares are prest. What is it that I doubt? through every joynt Daunces a trembling agve, this dull blood, That courses through my veines devines no good. shouts of ioy within. Ha, shovts of ioy, at dead mens obsequies? I'me in a maze of woes, what thou wilt throw On me, Ioue, let it come, ile stand thy blow. Chers. Live happy Baiazet. Baia. Happy in my feare, That word sounds sweet in my distracted eare. Happy in what? Ach. In thy friends, He turnes aside to them. That grieve to see thy wrongs. Ba. My wrongs, There sticks the string my thoughts did harpe vpon; But who hath wrong'd me in this high content? The fates doe sometime frowne, yet blesse th'event, And sequell of our woes, it cannot be, I should be thwarted in my jollity. But if I can vnfold itâfor the more, I know them not the greater is my sore. Chers. In that read all thy woes, take there a briefe, He giues him a paper Contract of all thine ills, sad lines of griefe. Baia. How's this? my yongest sonne aduanced to my seate. Corcutus Imperator, sure I dreame: These are but empty apparitions Fain'd by the god of sleepe to vexe my soule, Were they not soâere this blacke night Had throwne her sable mantle ore the heauens To hide me from my shame; but is it so? I doe but flatter vp my selfe, they are true And reall griefes, my Passion sayes they are, Isaack, Achmetes, are they not? Ach. Too true Great Baiazet: Baia. Corentus Imperator, reades againe Would I had seene thy name writ in the booke Of darke damnation, rather then these lines. Crackt not mine eye-strings when I viewed this text? See how each letter spreads abroad in pompe, As if they scorn'd my teares, how I could dwell On these two words, Corcutus Imperator. Hither repaire, the watchfull paper wormes That scan old recordes ouer to a line: Here in two wordes imprinted shall you see, The modell of a dolefull historie; Vertue dishonoured, breach of filiall love, Right shouldered ovt by wrong, nor can you faine, A crime, which these two words doe not containe, But now I rayle, not grieve. O nimble ayre, Let my plaints vanish as they spoken are, Off with this womanish mildnesse, I will finde A shorter tricke then this to ease my mind, Pluto beware, I come to raigne in hell, about to kill himselfe. Fates bid me rule, and birth-right to excell. Chers. Stay Baiazet, that arme can breake a path Vnto thy earthly Monarch, ere thou come To blesse the bankes of sweete Elysium, With thy wisht presence: Mahomet forefend That thou should'st seale a Kingdome to thy sonne, By this vntimely death, Corcutus raignes, But at thy better pleasure; when he shall heare Thou art arrived, then hee'l twixt ioy and griefe, Start from his throne, and nimbly runne to meete, Thy pompe, and throw his Scepter at thy feete: If hee but slacke that duty here are by, Achmetes strong and bolde, Isaacke and I. Devoted to your service, yet the world stands On wavering doubts, ready to clappe their hands. Baia. My desires are crown'd, And from the gate of Limbo, where I sate, I feele my spirits knocke against the heavens. Achmetes? In that name I heare an ease Of all my griefes pronounced, he shall suffice To banish vsurpation from my throne, Did furyes guard it round, hee's able well To reach my Kingdomes from the gripes of hell. Ach. My sword, and life, both which are vow'd to thee, Are still at thy command: walke but along, Corcutus shall resigne, thou haue no wrong. Exeunt Baiazet, Cherseogles, and Achmetes, Mauent Isaack, and Mustapha. Scena Tertia, Isaack. Death, and the furies plunge the obsequious slaues, Would he have joyn'd with vs? we would haue kept Corcutus high, and honoured, where he sits In spight of a whole hoast of Baiazets. Musta. Me thinkes your power might haue bin greater farre Ouer Achmetes, one adict to you By no lesse bond of dutie, then the sonne Is to the father: Isa. Mustapha Ile tell you Had not my daughter beene espoused to him, I had nam'd his death, and by some plot Work't him a quicke destruction long e'r this; Now let vs temporize with Baiazet; Yet keepe thy nature ever, and be true To thine owne profit; Fortune may aduance Some other Prince, worth both thy loue and mine. Musta. Weele stay her leasure, Isaack See more Harpies gathered to catch a Crowne, O tis a charming baite. Exit vter?. Enter Mahomete, Achmetes, Selinus. Mahom. Me thinks these City walles smile on our entrance, As if they knew great Baiazets three sonnes, Were come to grace their beautie. Sel. But We should frowne On them which harbor such blacke treasons, Well, Were I great Baiazet, I'de ring a noyse Of spightfull horrour, that should make the grovnd Tremble beneath their weight at such a sound: A younger sonne enthron'd an Emperour. Achm. Brother containe your selfe, come lets away, To see the end that waits on this sad day. Exeunt As they goe Trizham and Mahomet, two other Sonnes of Baiazet goe to meete them. Selin. What Mahomet? Achm. And Trizham? heers a fight Of one mans issue, Noble Baiazet, Brothers we haue iumpt together? Sel. All save one, And hee's a great deale better so alone. Triz. Corcutus t'is you meane, who though he raigne, Aboue vs now, yet must fall backe againe, Into our rancke, t'is Baiazet must rise, And hee descend, such a report there flyes. Exeunt. Sccena Quarta. Enter Corcutus, Cherseogles, Mesithes. Corcu. Did he not frowne, and storme? Chers. It mooued him much, And wrought strange passious in him, when he read Your name, and found your name so intituled. Corcu. Cling to my temples thou blest ornament, Be ever vnremoued, though all the gods Chide me in thunder for this insolence, Am I in heaven? in state placed on the spheare Of eminence, but barely to appeare, With faint, and borrowed luster, then descend, Rankt with the vulgar heads, first let me feele, The Tition vulture, or Ixions wheele; And the worst torture hell it selfe can bring, To scourge my soule, Ã´ let me dye a King; But stay, I must bethinke me at what rate, I purchase these faire trappings: ha? the curse Of him that got mee: start my daunted spirits, Shall I vsurpe a throne, and sit aboue my father, Whilest the gaping pit of hell, With wide stretcht iawes, yawnes for my fall, O I am strucke with horror, and the slaves of stix, Already sting my wounded soule. Chers. Will you faire Prince reiect all future hopes Of just succession, and afflict your Sire, By your vniust detainment of his Crowne. Corcu. I am distracted, and me thinkes I burne, Vnder these robes of state, a boyling heate, Runnes from them through my veines, Ioues hardy sonne, When he bewrapt himselfe in Nessus shirt, Felt not more bitter agonies, then I, Cloath'd in the trappings of my Maiestie. I am resolved; Bassaes, goe meete our father, Allure him home with this: I am begun Exeunt Mesithes and Cherseogles. To be no King, but a repentant sonne. Pallas I aske thy pardon, I haue straied A gracelesse trewant from thy happy schooles, Whither I'le now returne; theres not a ranke, Place, or degree, can sort vs out true blisse Without thy Temple, there my dwelling is: Amongst the Sacred monuments of wit, Which Classique authors carefully haue writ For our instruction, I will wast my time; So to wash out the spots of this sad crime. Court honors, and you shaddowes of true joy That shine like starres, till but a greater light Drowne your weake luster, I adjure your sight, Even from my meditations, and my thoughts I banish your entising vanities, And closely kept within my studie walles, As from a cave of rest, henceforth Ile see, And smile, but neuer tast your misery. I but as yet am floating on the waues, Of stormy daunger, nor am sure to scape The violent blast of angry Baiazet. Blow faire my hopes and when I touch the shoare, Ile venture forth on this rough surge no more. Enter Baiazet, Cherseogles, Achmetes, Isaack, Mesithes, Mustapha, Mahomet, Achomates, Selymus, Trizham, Mahomet Zemes disguised. See where he comes, oh how my guiltie blood Starts to my face, and proues my cause not good. Our dutie to our father, kneeles. Baia. Ours to the Emperor. kneeles Cor. Why kneeles great Baiazet? I am thy sonne Thy slaue: and if thy wrath but frowne, vndone. Why kneeles great Baiazet, heavens hide thy face, From these preposterous doings. Ba. What, not asham'd To circle in thy brow with that bright Crowne, Yet blush to see mee kneele? though filiall rites, And morrall precepts say the sonne must bend Before the Father, yet your high degree And powre bids you rise, commands my knee. Corc. Those ornaments be thine, Here Baiazet I Crowne thee Monarch of the spatious West, Asia, and Affrica: if ought be mine, Greater then these I here proclaime it thine. Omnes. Liue Baiazet our mighty Prince, Liue, rule, and flourish. Baia. Is this your zeale? is it? did euery voyce Breath out a willing suffrage? I am crowned, My ioyes are fully perfect, and I feele My lightned spirits caper in my brest. Rise thou starre-bright mirrour of thine age, To Corcutus kneeling. By thee our iron dayes proue full as good, As when old Saturne thundred in the clowds. Be an example to succeeding times, How sonnes should vse their Parents: and I vow (When I shall faile) this honour to thy brow. Attend vs Bassaes, Ile lead on to ioy, Neuer was Father blest with such a Boy. Exeunt omnes manet Corcut. Corcu. Freed from a Princely burthen, I possess A Kingly liberty, and am no lesse Princely; obseruance wayte on him, on me Thoughts vndisturb'd, I shall then happy be. Exit. Scena Quinta. Enter Zemes the brother of Baiazet alone. Zemes. Scarce had I set my foote within these walls In expectation of a solemne hearse, Due to the wandring Ghost of Mahomet; But lowd alarmes of abundant ioy Ring in mine eares, and euery seruile groome Congratulates the Coronation A showt within. Of Baiazet: harke how they roare it out. A cold disturbance like a gelid frost Settles my blood within me, and I hate His cheerefull triumphes, more then mine owne Fate 'Tis true indeede, I prou'd not the first fruites, An elder off-spring of my Fathers breede, Yet was it so that Baiazet and I Both tumbled in one wombe, perhaps the Queene Of womens labours doted at our birth, And sent him first abroad, or else I slept, And he before me stole into the world, Must I then loose my glory, and be hurl'd A slaue beneath his feete? no, I must be An Emperour as full as great as he. Exit. Scena Sexta. Enter Isaack alone. Isaack. Deuorc'd my Daughter? fond and insolent man, Ile crush thee into nothing, if I can Endure the noyse of my disgrace I know How to returne it; I am a flame of fire, A chasing heat distempers all my blood. Achmetes thou must coole it, when thy limbes Are emptied of that moysture they sucke in, And thy stain'd blood inchanted from thy veines, Then shall I be appealed, meane while I liue Thy mortall foe: But stay, let me containe Mine anger vndiscouered. Friend how is't? Enter Mesithes. Mesith. Know you not Isaack? Isa. What? Mes. The flight of Zemes Hence to Armenia. Isa. Or Zemes? Mes. Yes he walkt About the Citie disguis'd, and vnseene Till his escape. Is. Tis strange and full of feare. Mes. We meet him frequent in the vulgar mouth. Isaack. Zemes is valiant, and Armenia strong, Here's Baiazet, he must beware the wrong. Enter Baiazet. Baia. VVhat is it thou murmurst, Baiazet and wrong'd? Something it is thou knowest concerning vs: Take thee faire leaue, and speake it. Isa. Yes I know Matter of weight, such as concerne thy life. Baia. Such as concerne my life? Speake out thy tale, VVe are so flesht in ioy, bad newes proues strange, And touch my sense too harshly. Isa. But you must heare. Your brother Zemes, when swift winged Fame Tolde him your father Mahomet was dead, Flew quickly hither first to celebrate His funerall pompe, then to assume his State, His Crowne, and Scepter: which he rightly knew, Vnto your hand, and head, both to be due. But when applausiue ioyes, and peales of mirth, Sounded loud Musique in his troubled eares, Of you enthron'd; then he began too late To brawle at heauen, and wrangle with his Fate. So he went hence and cried; reuenge be mine: Quake thou great Citie of proud Constantine At my fierce anger, when I next returne, VVith cloudes of misty powder, I shall choake Thy breath, and dull thy beauty with it's smoake. This posted he hence to Armenias King, There to implore his ayde, which he will bring To front thy power: nor doth he yet dispaire, To dispossesse, and fright thee from thy chaire. Baiazet. First from my body shall he fright my soule, And push me into dust. Isaack make hast To muster vp our forces, strike vp our Drummes, Let them proclaime destruction through the world, Cleare vp your dusty armour, let it cast Such an amazing lustre on the Foe, As if Bellona danc'd on euery crest. The bright sunne of my glory is eclipsed, Till Zemes be extinct: he must not shine To dull my beames, since the whole heauen is mine. Call forth Achmetes, his vnconquered arme, Shall keepe vs safe from this intended harme. Isaack. My Liege, you haue forgot Archmetes oath, In which he vowed neuer to draw his sword In your defence. Baia. I had forgot it, But now I remember, such was the vaine Heat of my youth, but I recall againe VVhat euer I protested, tell him so. Rash words must be dispensed with. Isa. Then Ile goe. Exit. Baia. My Father once in ordering of a Campe, Preferr'd me to be Captaine of a wing, So when the Battailes ioyned, and life and death VVhere strugling who should winne power of our breath, Our Armies prou'd the stronger; onely my guide Fail'd, and a base repulse fell on my side; At which my Father storm'd, and in my place Seated Achmetes, for which black disgrace, I vow'd a swift reuenge, euen by his shame That wore mine honour, to redeeme my fame; VVhich when Achmetes heard, he deepely swore, Neuer with wit and strength to guide me more. But now he must, see where he comes, and arm'd. Enter Achm. What strange deuice is plotting in his braine? Honored Achmetes. Ach. Royall Emperor. Giues him a sword. Baia. Thine arme must then vphold my Royalty. Why lyes thy valour, prostrate at our feete, When like fierce lightnings it should runne and meete My harmes like a rocke vnmou'd? oppose The course, and headlong torrent of my foes. Achm. I am a man of peace, mistake me not. I made a vow, nor can it be forgot, Till you reuoke your oath. Baia. Which here I doe, Great Mahomet be witnesse, that I meane Sincerely what I speake, Achmetes now Giues him his sword againe. VVe're friends, and thus I nullifie my vow; Heauens on this concord lend a gracious smile. Achmetes I haue plac'd thee in my bosome, Gaue thee an honour'd title in my loue; And of as lasting constancie, as is The sunne which lookes so cheerefully on this Goe fit the Ianizaries to the warres, Kindle new fire of valor in their breasts, Thou art their Genius, euen the breath they draw, Rayse then thy plumes, and keepe thy foes in awe. Achm. Stood there a Pluto at thy citie walles. And with a band of furies had besieg'd Thy people, I would coniure them away, And send them backe to hell: so thou shalt stand As fast as in the skyes, vnder mine hand. Baia. I am Crown'd in thee, nor can I fall, Whilest such a valour breathes within our wall, Zemes depose me? hee must be more strong, Then Mars, that can doe Baiazet that wrong. Exeunt Scena Septima. Enter Zemes, and the King of Armenia. Arme. Wee hate thy brother, therefore lend thee ayde, 'Tis not our dutie to expostulate Thy right vnto the Crowne, on to your warres, Thriue in your proiects, I shall joy to see A quarrell fought twixt Baiazet and mee. Ile second thy encounters, and we two Like the two Roman thunder-bolts of warre, Will with the flashes of our fierie swordes Keepe their composed rankes, that they shall stand Agast, to see two Scipioes in one band, Zemes. Thankes great Armenian King, and when I am Wheel'd to that height, which now my brother holdes, I shall requite these benefits, and vow That kindnesse, which I can but promise now. Arm. Come let's away, our armies are well set, Ready to march, now tremble Baiazet. Exeunt Scena Octaua. Enter Achmetes in his Generalls coate, and Caigubus his sonne. Achm. Caigubus, publike dangers call me forth, And I must leaue thee now vnto thy selfe My sonne, thou seest vnto what height of fame We are ascended, yet the sunne shines cleare, And not one dusky cloude of discontent Dimmes the vnspotted brightnesse of our ioyes, Not Baiazet is more belou'd then I: Such strict obseruance is there shew'd to mee, By all that know my worth, and heare me nam'd, As if I grasp't Ioues thunder in my hands: By all my hopes, I feare some tragicke sceane Will trouble our calme fortune. Sonne beware, The top of honour is a narrow plot Of ground, whither we haue already got, 'Tis brittle, and vncertaine, if thou tread One carelesse steppe aside, thou fall'st downe dead The shute from thence is deepe, and vnderneath, Ruine gapes wide, thy body to receiue. Stand firme Caigubus: though thou start'st not away Yet blasts of envie often force aside The weariest footsteppe: these where e'r they shall, Blow strong, will make them stagger if not fall. Caigu. I shall forget to sleepe, to breath, to liue, Sooner then these thy precepts they are fixt, And printed in my thoughts. Ach. Enough, no more, That Isaack Bassa trust him not too much: I haue divorc'd his daughter from my bed, For her adulterate loosenesse, hence, hee hides A masse of fretting ranchor in his brest, Which he hath varnish't yet, and gilded o're With coloured shewes of love, but he is false, And subtile as a Serpent, that will winde Into thy brest, stinging thee ere thou finde Or once suspect his hatred; I must away, Trumpets sound. Hasty alarmes call me hence, thus, and farewell, Envie growes greater, as our states excell: Exit. Caigu. Father, adiew. Exit.</field>

Trizham, and Mahomet, it concernes you now, To flie hence nimbly to your Provinces, Zemes is come too neere vs to escape, He cannot flye the ground whereon he treads, But through your countreys, hast then, if she wars Cracke not his threed of life, his flight will bee When you may intercept it; if we presume Only on bold Achmetes, and our selues, In beds of downe supinely, sleepe at home, Zemes may scape the tempest of our wrath. Then we hope best, when each event we see, Thwarted with their preventing policie. Trizham.

Enter Achmetes, Cherseogles, Mustapha, Mesithes, drummes and Trumpets. Achm. The battell will prove great and dangerous, But were their number double more then ours, The justice of our cause bids vs goe on, And like a cheerefull drumme strikes panting feare From euery brest. Father, lead you the vangard, The reare-ward be your charge, the right wing yours, My selfe will guide the left, this day shall crowne Your valour in full pride, Zemes must downe. Enter Zemes, Armenia, two Captaines. Zem. Time hath outstript our hast, our foes doe stand, Wauing their golden plumes, as if the gods, Were come to meete great Zemes in the field, Their armies planted, and a distilling cloud, Hovers aboue their heads, as if it wept, At their approaching fate. Armenia's King Leade you the vanguard, vnder your command The reareward shall march on, the Phalance Be your care braue Captaines, as we're inform'd, Achmetes rules the left wing of our foe, Ile rule the right wing of ours, so when I meete, Him in his pride Ile prostrate at his feete. Arme. Our men are ordered, Zemes leade the way, The skies looke duskie blacke on this sad day. Exeunt Trumpets sound to the battaile, dumbe shewes in skirmishes, one of Zemes Captaines and Cherseogles meete, Zemes Captaine preuailes, his second and Mesithes meete, Mesithes retires, she King of Armenia and Mustapha meete, Armenia preuailes, and pursues the battaile. Enter Achmetes with his sword. Ach. Great Queen of chance; but do I call on this Vnconstant St pdame? be thou propitious Mars, Rough god of warre: steele vp this wearie arme, And put a ten fold vigor in my bones; What shall Achmetes fall, and in his losse, Great Baiazet, be wrong'd? it cannot bee Death comes to wound thee Zemes, I am hee. As he goes out, the King of Armenia meetes him, they fight, Achmetes makes him retire from the stage, and pursues him in his furie, enters againe at the one dore, Zemes at the other, they meete, drums and trumpets sounding. Ach. Zemes? Zem. Achmetes? Opportunelie met, Here staggers all the fortune of the field, This houre must blesse me, and a single fight Purchase thee honor, and to mee my right: Honour to thee, to die by Zemes hand, My right to me, an Empire to command. Achm. Braue Prince, I more lament thy case then can thy selfe That runnest with such madnesse on the edge Of desperate ruine, thou art but young and weake, Manhoods soft blossomes are not fully spread Vpon thy downy chinne; but riper yeeres Haue setled the compacture of my ioynts, And they are strongly knit: 'twill vexe my soule In the cleare morne of thine vp-rising hopes, To wrap thee in a fatall cloude of death. Submit thee to thy brother, thou shalt finde Me thy true friend, him mercifull and kinde. Zem. Submit? had I a right to Ioues high Throne, And stood in opposition of his power, Should all the gods aduise me to submit, I would reiect their counsell: much more thine. Guard thee Achmetes, thy stroke abide, I cannot gore thy Prince but through thy side. They fight and breath: fight againe. Achmetes takes away Zemes sword. Zem. The day be thine, and Zemes stand thy Fate; Strike home, I'ue lost the day, and life I hate. Achm. Haue at thee then Offers to run at him with both swords. Not stirre? now by my sword Thou shalt haue fayrer play before thy death: Take backe thy sword, in that I recommit My forfeit to thy charge, thy life with it. They fight againe and Achmetes wounds him on the head. Zemes falls. Zem. Oh! hold thy conquering hand, and giue my soule A quiet passage to her rest; my blood Beginnes to wast, and a benuming cold, Freezes my vitall spirits: Achmetes goe, Tell Baiazet that thou hast slaine his toe. Ach. Farewell, braue sonne of Mars, thy fame shall stay With vs, although thy soule flit hence away. Zemes. I haue not lyed, Achmetes thou hast slaine, My hopes, and therefore me, my woundes art shallow, But my state desperate, Ha? what shall I doe? Armenia's King is fled backe to his home, Cold entertainment will attend me there; The field is emptie, euery man retir'd, Onely a few dead carcasses, and I, Then whither shall I bend my steps? to Rome? To Rome then let it bee: Bishop I come, Th'art a religious thing, and I will trust, My life to one so innocently just. Exit. Scena Quarta. Enter Mahometes, Achomates, Selymus three of Baiazets sonnes. Sely. Indeed we may be thought vpon in time, When there be Countries more then there be men, We may get some preferment: sit at home And proue good boyes, and please our father well. My thoughts are two vnbridled, Baiazet, aside I neither can, nor will endure thy curbe, My comprest valor like a strangled fire. Breakes out in violent flames, and I must rule. Trizham and Mahomet are slipt in hast Each to their seuerall Prouince, we must stay, That are their Elders for another day; This Court will proue our scaffold where vve stand Plac't in the eye of angry Baiazet: Who thvvarts him in his fury is but dead, And in that passions heate, off goes his head. I must not liue thus. Maho. I could bee content, He feares not death, vvhose thoughts are innocent. Sely. I thanke you brother, then belike some crimes Lye heauy on my conscience, and I feare, Vnlesse I shift my station, 'twill be knowne; You thinke well of me kind Mahometes. Maho. As well as of a brother I can thinke. If by a rash applying to your selfe, My words haue beene distastfull, blame not me. Sely. Can I applie them then vnto my selfe? Am I so loose in manners? by heauen and earth, Thou shalt repent this deepelie. Ach. Stop that oath, Brothers agree, or walke hence but along Into my garden, where each springing hearbe Smiles on my faire content, there you shall see, How flowers of one stocke, so twisted are, One in the others twinings, that they shew, One stands by th'others helpe, both ioyntly grow; These shall suffice your quarrels to remooue, And dumbe examples teach a liuely loue. Maho. Come let vs goe. Exeunt Mahomates, and Achomates. Sely. Straight I will follow you. Away fond wretches, Ã´ that every breast Were of so dull a temper as you two. But who come's heere? Enter Corcutus Brother Corcutus whither are you bent, What from the Court so soone? Corcu. My father bids, I goe to vndertake the charge, his loue Hath throwne vpon me; That's rich Jonia. Sely. You goe to rule there? Cor. Yes: Sely. Heauens speede you well. Cor. Deare Selymus adiew. Sel. Brother farewel. Exit Corcutus Revenge and you, three furious twinnes of night, Ascend vp to our theater of ill, Plunge my black soule twice in your Stygian flood, That by it's vertue it may be congeal'd, And harden'd against remorse: Pluto enrich My breast, with a diviner pollicie, Then every trifling braine can reach vnto; Ile fill the world with Treasons, and my wit Shall put new tracts to death: Charon shall see, His wastage still in vse by companie, Sent thither by my care, o 'twill doe well, To blast the earth with want, and furnish hell. Exit. Scena Quinta, Enter Isaack Baiazet. Isaack. Tush, vertue makes men fooles, Isaack be wise, Shake off the tender fetters of remorse, And hugge that chance, that opens thee the way To ruinate Achmetes: did he stand On termes of conscience, neighbor-hood or loue, When he cashierd my daughter from his house, And to the worlds broad eye, opened her crime? No: he was swift and bitter in his hate, And so will I, he is but now return'd In Triumph from the field, as full of pride As I of envy, hence Ile ground my hate. When fierce Bellona smil'd on Baiazet, Amidst the fiery tumults of the Warre, She offered Zemes to Achmetes hand, They fought, Achmetes conquered at his foote, Fell the proud rebell, wounded, but not slaine, There might Achmetes with a blow of death Cut off our feares, continued in his breath: This shall incense the angry Emperor, And crush Achmetes in his fairest hopes. True polititians worke by others hands, So I will by the Prince, my plot stands firme: See where he comes, now sly Mercurius, whet My tongue, to kindle hate in Baiazet. Enter Baiazet. Baia. Isaack how thriu'd Achmetes in his Warres, Fame is of late growne dumbe of his renowne, Surely vnwelcome newes clogs her swift wings, Else had she now bin freqvent in our Court; And we had fully knowne the chance of all. Isa. We had, yet could not the event, Lie so conceal'd, but Isaac found it out, Which when I first discovered, straight it wrought Tempests of passions in me, joy and griefe Raign'd at one instant in the selfe same breast. Baiazet As how? Isa. As thus. I joy'd that Zemes fell, Was sorry he escap'd. Baia. Fell and yet escap'd? Isa. Beneath Achmetes feete the traytor fell. Baia. And yet escaped, good Ioue how may this bee. Isa. Thus it might be, and was so: when sad death Was glutted with the ruine of each side, When slaughtring Mars had stain'd the field with blood, And cast a purple colour o'r the earth, At length some milder providence desir'd, An end of those hot tumults that were seene, To last in Zemes breath; so that their fire Would be extinct, when Zemes should expire Then from the middle skirmish forth were brought He and Achmetes, being met they fought, Zemes was vanquish't by a violent blow, Which strucke him trembling lower then his knees; Now whither flattering, or present gifts Redeem'd him from his fate I cannot show Something they plotted, what, none yet can know. Baia. Canst thou advise me Isaack how to sound The depth of all his mischiefe. Isa. Thus you may. He being come from Zemes ouerthrow, And yet luke-warme in blood, and full of ioy, You may in way of honour and free mind, Call him this night to banquet, then being set, When the hot spirits of carroused healths, Haue spoyl'd his wit of smooth and painted tales, And wine vnlockt the passage for the truth, Bid him relate the manner of his warre, The chances and events; then when he comes To Zemes, if he erre about his flight, His ends are bad, his bosome blacke as night. Baia. Thou art my good Angel, Isaack I applaud Thy faithfull plot, Achmetes were thy soule As darke as hell, and thy enclosed thoughts, As subtill as a winding Laberinth, By such a guide as can remoue each doubt, And by a quill of threed I'de tracke them out. But Isaacke, if we trappe him in this wiles, How shall we kill the traytor? We haue a tricke, Already strange to catch him in the nicke. Isac. Easily thus: our lawes allow a custome, Not vs'd of late, yet firme still in effect, And thus it is; when there doth breath a man, Direfully hated of the Emperour, And he in strickt seueritie of right Cannot proceed against him, then he may Orewhelme him in a robe of mourning blacke, Which we haue cal'd deaths mantle, that thing done, The man thus vs'd, is forfetted to fate, And a deuoted sacrifice to him Whom he had er'st offended, neither can Strength or intreatie, wrest him from his death, Both which are treason, and inexpiable. Thus then you may proceede, vvhen banquets done, And all their comicke merriment runne on To the last sceane, and euery man expects A solemne gift, due to Achmetes vvorth, Call for a robe therewith to decke your friend, And perfect all his glory, let that bee This robe of fate, in which ready at hand, You may intombe the traytor, and be wrappe His pampered body in a vaile of death, So let him dye, dreame not on the event, Vice is rewarded in it's punishment. Baia. I will be fierce and sudden, Isaack inuite Achmetes to a feast: he dies this night. Exit Baia. Isa. I shall: vvould not a private vvarning serue But open penance must correct my child, And a seuere divorcement quite degrade Her other honoured Matrimoniall rights? Were he as strong, as steele-like joynted Mars, As much applauded through our popular streetes, As er'st Dictator Fabius was in Rome, Or great Augustus, yet the slaue should feele The wrath of an inflamed father light Heauy vpon his soule, and that e'r the next sunne Appeare, Achmetes all thy glorie's done. Exit. Scena Sexta. Enter Achmetes, and Caigubus his sonne. Caigu. I fear'd your safety and devoutly prayed The sword of justice, which your hand did swaye, Might be of conquering force. Ach. Thy prayers were heard And I am here as safe as I went forth, Vntouch't by the rough hands of desperate warre, Nor did I once spie danger in the field, But when I fronted Zemes, then there met Two streames of valor, sith on vs was set The chance of the whole combat, others stood Expecting which of vs should loose his blood: But heaven was just, and to compose the strife, This sword at one sad blow tooke thence his life. Caig. The heavens were iust indeed, but who comes heere, Isaack, Mesithes, and Baiazets three sonnes, Enter Isaack, Mesithes, Mahometes, Achomates, Selymus. Ach. They come to gratulate my late successe, I see their errand foulded in their smiles, How cheerefully they looke vpon my ioyes, Omnes. All happines attend Achmetes. Ach. Thankes Noble friends, how fares the Emperor. Isaack. Well by your guard, and he hath sent vs now, All to invite your presence to a feast, We must be frolike, and this following night, Shall Crowne your joy with revels and delight, Or else deprive thy soule of that good light. aside Ach. We must be frolicke Captaines, thinke not then On my loud drummes, and staring trumpeters, Such whose strong lungs roare out a bellowing voyce, Would make a man daunce Antick in the fire, Weele haue a choicer musique, and my feete, Shall tread a neater march, then such harsh straines Can teach them, with more pleasure, and lesse paines. Since it hath pleas'd the Emperor to grace Our slender merrits thus: we shall be there, To taste his bountie. Mes. Weele lead on before. Ach. Ile follow you. Isa. Ne'r to returne more, aside Exeunt omnes, Manent, Achmetes, and Caigabus. Ach. I am happy aboue envie, and my state, Not to be thwarted with iniurious fate, I could disburden all my jealous thoughts, And shake that currish vice supition, off From my sincere affection, I haue wrong'd Sure I haue wrong'd thee Isack thy chast loue, Cloakes not intended mischiefe, blacke deceit Cannot lie hid vnder so pure a white, But it would cast a coloured shadow out, Through such a slender vayle, thy generous thoughts, Nourish no base detraction; thy free loue Thy profest actions, say t'were no just fate That good mens deedes should die by ill mens hate. Caig. Pray heaven they doe not. Ach. feare not, I am guest To Baiazet, expected at the feast, Exeunt Scena Septima. Enter Baiazet, and Cherseogles. Baia. The day's farre spent, is not Achmetes come? Chers. Not yet great Emperor. Baia. Vice-roy of Greece, say now there were a man Whom my mind honored, and I should command, To cloath his body in a suite of gold, Studded with gems, worth all the Indian snore, Durst any tongue gainsay it: Chers. Surely no. Baia. What if I hated him, and should command To wrappe him in a sable coloured blacke, And sentence him to death? Chers. Then he must die. Baia. My thoughts are troubled. Chers. What should these questions meane, Abrupt demands, one to confound the other? My liege, your guests are come. Enter Achmetes, Isaack, Mahometes, Achomates, Selymus, Mesithes, Caigubus. Baia. Blest be the houre in which I see Achmetes safe return'd Bring in our banquet souldiers: boyes kneele round, Enter a banquet, all kneele.

Let's know your whole events. Ach. Great Emperor Scarce had the rosie day-starre through the East, Display'd her silver colours through the heauen, But all the watchfull souldiers ready arm'd, Dim'd her pale cheekes, with their transparent steele, And added lustre to the dull sight morne, So stood we in full pride till the bright Sunne Climing the glassie pauement of the skies, Rouz'd the slow spirits of the backward foe, And vrg'd them to the field; at length stept forth Zemes, in all the trappings of his state: And like a well-taught Hector, rang'd his troupes, Into their seuerall orders, all prepar'd Titan being fearefull stept behind a cloud, Lest when he saw our limbs bath'd all in blood, And purple streames gush't from our wounded breasts, Like vvater from their springs; he in a feare Should be eclips'd, or startle from his spheare, The ayre was thicke and dimme, our armies joyn'd, The skirmishes grew hot, and angry Mars Inthron'd vpon the battlements of heauen, Left either side to tugge with their owne strength, Till their oppressing multitude bore downe, The justice of our cause, and our whole side, Not daring to withstand, scorning to flye, Stood trembling on the vtmost brinke of hope, Then the propitious Gods singled me out Zemes, the life and spirit of our foes: We met and fought, such was my happy fate, That at the first encounter Zemes fell, And I disarm'd him, when in proud contempt, He spit defiance in the face of death, Open'd his brest, and dard me to the stroake, Whereby I might haue sent him hence to hell, But I in admiration of his worth, Arm'd his right hand once more and bad him fight, Chance did direct my sword vpon his head, He fell before me, and cry'd, Achmetes hold; I'me wounded to the death, and Captaine goe Tell Baiazet that thou hast slaine his foe. I left the dying Prince, our warres were done And ceas'd with him, by whom they were begunne. Isaacke. The plot has tooke. aside Baia. Treason by Mahomet. I left the dying Prince. Isaack. Pursue the proiect. Baia. Worthy Achmetes, Well we may giue, but not reward by gifts, And thanke, but not requite thee, I would hate That liberality which would abate The worth of the receiuer, thy true fame, Outstrips the length of titles, and a name Of weightie honour, is a slender price, To grace thy merits with, as for a voice, To crowne, thee after death, thou art the choice, Of euerliuing glory, on thy crest, Is her abode, and when the latest rest Of nature, hath betrayd thee to thy graue, Then shall she print in characters of gold How braue a man thou wast, how great, how bold; Though we be dumb, yet shall the world vplift, Thy name, and thou shalt liue without our gift. Yet thy blest fates, haue not created thee So clearely Godlike, but some other chance, May crosse thy greatnesse, and thy high renowne The envie of some God may shoulder downe, Then thus weele make thee happy, future events Ne'r shall oppresse thy worth, nor enuious chance Blot thy ensuing fame, Achmetes know, Death an immortall gift, we thus bestow. He casts a gowne of blacke veluet vpon him, called the mantle of death. Caigub. Treason, treason. O my Father treason, Helpe Ianizaries. Excurrit. Baia. Stop the furious youth. Exeunt Bassaes. Bring in an Heads-man. Traytor, Zemes dead? He liues to see this hand vntwine thy thread. Enter seuen or eight Ianizaries with swords drawne. What meanes this outrage? Ianiza. 1. Cruell homicide. 2.

Is not thy Guard about thee. Baia. Hemn'd in with death? My friends beset me round Not to preserue my life, but murder me. Blush you pale heauens at this abhorred fact, That they may see their crimes, and be asham'd Of this vnheard offence: Valiant Ianizaries, Sheath vp these weapons of rebellion, Print not that vgly sinne vpon your brow, Let my tree pardon woe you to submit. Keepe your alleagiance firme. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha, ha. 1 One word more damnes thee. 2 How pretily he began to talke 3 Of sinne and pardon. Baiazet behold Here stands a man milde, honour'd, gracious, Valiant, and faithfull; gentle in command, At home belou'd, and fear'd amongst our foes, Yet hath thy hand of cruelty assay'd The hated murder of so deare a friend: Blush you pale heauens at this abhorred fact, That he may see his crimes, and be asham'd Of this new bloudinesse. Wicked Baiazet These admonitions fit the teacher well. Baia. But heare me speake. 4 First set Achmetes free, then speake thy fill. Baia. What shall I be compell'd? 5 And quickly too. 6 We cannot brooke to see him stand thus cloath'd. Baia. Your anger will haue way. Achmetes goe. Takes off the Mantle. There take him. They haue sau'd thee from this woe. Exeunt showting and leaping. Pernicious villaines, they haue crost my plot, 'Twas intercepted eu'n in the last deede: What should Achmetes meane thus to ingrosse The best affections of my Ianizaries? Will he defraud me of my Crowne and life? My life I weigh not: but to loose my Crowne Were to be sentenc'd to a hell of woes. I am full stuft with choller. Slauish Peasants Held I a sword of power in mine hand, I would disioynt them peece-meale; can I not? Am I not Emperour? men call me so: A reuerend title, empty attributes, And a long page of words follow my name, But no substantiall true prerogatiue. Enter Isaack. Isaack. Good health to Baiazet. Baiaz. Indeed that's nothing, since your counsell fail'd. Isaack. Vse your best patience it may be regain'd. Affection in your stubborne multitude Is a prone torrent not to be withstood. Were you as sacred as their houshold gods, Yet when you thwart the current of their will, They'le breake the bands of duty, and prophane That holinesse to which they bound their thoughts. Mine eyes are witnesse with what liuely ioy They bore him through the streetes vpon their necks, Offering the vse of their best strength. Baia. No more. I am already gone. Why did not then His proud ambitious tongue bid them goe fetch My Crowne, and with quick speede disrobe a wretch? 'Twas in his power: we are distracted Isaack, Lend vs thy wholsome counsell to preuent My ruine, and their dangerous intent. Isaack. Mine is a blunt aduice, and deepe in bloud To cut off those base Peasants that withstood The force of your decree. Baiaz. To cut them off? Me thinkes I see my selfe yet circled in With their reuengefull swords, ha? cut them off? Could I but curse the Traytors from the earth, Or were my doome pronounc'd but of effect, I'de rattle such new torments in their eares, Should stagger their high courage; but my feares Strangle my furies, and my enuious fate Forceth my tongue to flatter, where I hate. Isaack. Here lyes the safest course, to rid these griefes Giue out, you'le goe to warre, so to enlarge your territories, And to this end fetch home, Those warlike Souldiers plac'd in Garrison. Let them remaine without the walls; at last, When things shall fit your purpose, leade them all By night into the Citie, and in one stroke Strike off so many thousand periur'd heads, As shall amaze posterity to heare, How many liues redeem'd thee from thy feare. Baiaz. The waight of all mine honour leanes on thee, That or some neerer course shall quell the pride Of strong Achmetes, and confound his side. Scena Octaua.

If your intents be vertuous, and desire Of eminent place quite banisht from your thoughts, My house shall be your Castie: that I denie My men and Armes to ayde you in your broyles, Thinke it kinde vsage: should my Holinesse Feede your ambition, and make strong your hand Against your brother 'twere too light a brand Of flaming hot discention, and to set The world in a combustion: all would then Quarrell by my example: No sweet Prince Romes holy Bishop must not so transgresse.

Hee's not our brother, but our hated foe: And in his death you shall preuent our woe. Returne our seruice back: tell Baiazet What he hath giuen in charge; shall by my hand Be carefully dispatcht. Messen. Good peace attend you. Exit. Bish. Imperious Turke, Am I not Gods Vize-gerent here on earth, And dar'st thou send thy letters of command? Or speake to me in threatning menaces?

Had the iust course of nature wrought thee hence, I would haue made the gods know their offence, And backe restore thy soule: but thou art dead, And 'twas a fiercer hand that clipt thy thread. Fiercer, and bolder, which did euer thriue By mischiefe, and once coffinde thee aliue Vp in deaths mantle, but then would not vse Such open violence, nor durst abuse One of such sacred worth, till fury struck His reason dead, and made his treacherous hand Creepingly stab thee, both vnseene and foule, As if he would haue stolne away thy soule. Enter Isaack. But oh! Isaack. But oh indeede! Caigub. Why what? Isaack. As bad A stroke attends thee as thy Father had: Princes suspition is a flame of fire, Exhal'd first from our manners, and by desire Of rule is nourish'd, fed, and rores about Till the whole matter dye, and then goes out.

We are preuented; see the fates command False deedes, must dye though by the Actors hand. Returne to Baiazet, and beare that corpes. Exeunt. So now I am alone, nor need I feare To breath my thoughts out to the silent ayre; My conscience will not heare me, that being deafe I may ioy freely: first thy hated breath Achmetes vanisht, next Caigubus fell, Thus we clime Thrones, whilst they drop downe to hell. The glorious eye of the all-seeing sunne, Shall not behold (when all our plots are done) A greater Prince then Selymus; 'tis hee Must share with Ioue an equall Maiesty. But for my selfe his Enginer I'le stand Aboue mortality, and with a hand Of power, dash all beneath me into dust, If they but crosse the current of my lust. What I but speake, 'tis Oracle and Law, Thus I will rule and keepe the world in awe. Selym. Noble assistant. Enter Selymus, Mesithes, Mustapha, Asmehemedes. Isaack. Happy Selymus. Selym. 'Tis thou must make me so, for should I stay Wayting my Fathers pleasure, I might stand Gazing with enuie at my Brothers pride, My selfe lying prostrate, euen beneath their feete. Townes, Cities, Countries, and what ere so euer Can giue high thoughts content, are freely theirs, I onely like a spend thrift of my yeares Idle my time away, as if some god Had raz'd my name out of the roule of Kings, Which if he haue, then Isaack be thy hand As great as his, to print it in againe Though Baiazet say nay, Isaack. No more: I will; An Empire be our hopes; that to obtaine Wee'le watch, plot, fight, sweat, and be colde againe. Exeunt. Scena Quarta. Enter Zemes, and Alexander Bishop of Rome. Bishop. Cannot my words add solace to your thoughts? Oh! you are gulft too deepe in a desire Of soueraigne pompe, and your high thoughts aspire. All the vnshadowed plainenesse of my life Doth but contract thick wrinckles of mislike In your Majestick brow, and you distast Morall receipts, which I haue ministred To coole Ambitions Feauer. Zemes. Pardon Sir, Your Holinesse mistakes my malady, Another sicknesse grates my tender breast, And I am ill at heart: alas, I stand An abject now as well in Natures eye, As erst I did in Fortunes: is my health Fled with mine honour? and the common rest Of man, growne stranger to me in my griefe? Some vnknowne cause hath bred through all my bloud A colder operation, then the juice Of Hemlock can produce: O wretched man! Looke downe propitious God heads on my woes: PhÅbus infuse into me the sweet breath Of cheerefull health, or else infectious death. If there an Angell be whom I haue crost In my tormented boldnesse? and these griefes Are expiatory punishments of sinne? Now, now repentance strike quite through my heart, Enough of paines, enough of bitter smart Haue tyed me to't. I haue already bin Bolted from ioy, content can enter in, Not at the open passage of my heart, I neither heare, nor see, nor feele, nor touch With pleasure; my vexation is so much. My graue can onely quit me of annoy; That preuents mischiefe, which can bring no ioy. Exit. Bish. Now I could curse what mine owne hand hath done, And wish that he would vomit out the draught Of direfull poyson, which infects his bloud. Ambitious fire? why 'tis as cleane extinct, As if his heart were set beneath his feet, Griefe hath boil'd out the humours of vaine pride, And he was meere contrition. What's the newes? Enter a Messenger. Messen. Zemes as now he left you, pale and wan, Dragging his weake legges after him, did fall Dead on the stony pauement of the Hall, Not by vnhappy chance, but as he walkt, Folding his armes vp in a pensiue knot, And rayling at his Fate, as if he staged The wounded Priam, or some falling King, So he, oft lifting vp his closing eye, Sunke faintly downe, groan'd out, I dye, I dye. Bish. It grieues my soule: let Baiazet know this Could our owne shortned life, but lengthen his By often sighes I would transfuse my breath Into his breast, and call him back from death. Exit. Scena Quinta. Enter Selymus, Mesithes, Mustapha. Selym. Let not my absence steale away my loue, Or locall distance weaken the respect Which you haue euer borne me; I must fly To shake the yoake of bondage from my necke: My Fathers eyes shall not scan out my life In euery action; then when I am gone, Our loue like pretious mettall shall not cracke In the protraction, but be gently fram'd Into a subtler thinnesse, which shall reach From either part, not craz'd by any breach. Mesith. Returne with ruine painted in thy brow, Pale death triumphant in thy horrid crest, Danger limm'd out vpon thy threatning sword, The Turkish thraldome pourtrai'd on thy shield, Wee'le meete thee in thy horror, and vnfold Our armes as wide as heauen to take thee in. Selym. We trust you: if there lie vnspoken loue Hid in your bosomes? we must bury it In silent Farewells. Mustaph. Noble Prince adiew, Since thy franke deeds haue printed in our hearts So true a patterne of thee, we will feed Our contemplation with thy memory. VVhen thou art really departed, thus A better part of thee shall stay with vs. Exeunt. Selym. So the swift wings of flight shall mount me vp Aboue these walls into the open ayre, And I will towre aboue thee Baiazet. Farewell soft Court; I haue beene kept too long VVithin thy narrow walls, and am new borne To golden liberty; now stretch out you heauens, Spread forth the dewy mantle of the cloudes Thou powerfull Sunne of Saturne, and remoue The terminating Poles of the fixt earth To entertaine me in my second birth. Enter Isaack Bassa. Isaack Not yet rid from our warrs? Faire Prince take heed, Treason's a Race that must be runne with speed: Ãolus beckons, and the flattering windes Ioyne all to helpe our proiect: quickly hence: All's full of danger. Did your Father know Hee'd stop your flight, and breath at one deaths blow. Selym. Friend I am gone: thou hoary God of Seas, Exit. Smooth the rough bosome of thy wrinckled tide, That my wing'd Boat may gently on it glide.</field>

How the obsequious duty of the world Hangs shiuering on the skirts of Majestie, And meils out all her footsteps: I could yet Neuer steale leasure to reforme my thoughts, Since my pale brow was first hoop'd in with gold Till this brest houre: aud now great Baiazet Empty thy breast of her imprison'd ioyes, Which like the smothring windes, could with a blast Rip vp a passage. I am crown'd in blisse, Plac'd on the rockes of strong security, Without the reach of Fate. Envie shall gnash And pine at my full pleasures; the soft feete Of labouring Ambition, shall quite tire Ere touch the starry-height on which I stand. Achmetes and his sonne with my two boyes Are falne, to cleare the sun-shine of my joyes, Achomates I feare not, Selymus Liues cag'd within the compasse of mine eye, All that I doubt is of Mahomates, That blazing starre once darkned, I will throw The lustre of my pompe from me, as cleare As if three Sunnes were orb'd all in one Spheare. What newes brings Isaack? Enter Isaack Bassa. Isaack. Vnwelcome newes. Baia. Be quick in the deliuery. Isaack. Then thus. Young Selymus is fled. Baia. Fled? Isaack.

Wee'le forward in our businesse, which beeing done, Weele coole the hot ambition of each sonne, As mine alreadie is, quicke mouing time Hath cast a snowy whitenesse on my haires, And frosty age hath quel'd the heate of youth, Mine intellectuall eyes, which euer yet Gaz'd on the worlds rich gilded vanities, Are now turn'd inward, and behold within, Dismall confusion of vnpardoned sinne. E'r since I first was setled on this Throne, My cares haue clog'd the swiftnesse of the houres, And wrought a tedious irkesomnesse of life, Murders haue mask'd the forehead of the Sunne With purple-coloured clouds, and he hath blusht At the blood-sucking cruelty of state. Ther's not one little angle of this Court, Whose guiltie walls haue not conceal'd a knot Of traitors, squaring out some hideous plot, Against my safety; now at last I spie The dangers of perplexed Maiestie. And were it not for a religious feare Of after-harmes, which wretchedly might teare And spoyle the body of this Monarchy, Here at this instant would I strike the sayle, And proud top-gallant of mine eminence, Hurle vp my scepter, dis-inthrone my selfe, And let the greene heads scramble for the Crowne. Age hath taught me a stayder prouidence Then my rash youth could reach to; I intend To place this glittering bable, on the head Of some successour, e'r I yet am dead, So giue it out; thereby Ile try the loue And fauour of the people: whom they seeme Most to affect I'le raise to that esteeme, How doe you like the counsell?

Exeunt. Scena Secunda. Enter Baiazet, takes Asmehemides by the hand, a Courtier belonging to Mahometes. Baia. Leaue vs; Wee would be priuate with our friend, 'Tis thou must doo't sweet Asmehemides, Mahomates and thou are two neere friends; He will suspect in others close deceit, Thee, for thy generous vertues he will stand With obuious embracements to receiue Into his bosome; whither when thou art Wound in, be sure to strike him through the heart. I am offended, 'tis just piety To sacrifice his body at the shrine Of my displeasure, doe it, I am thine. Asmehem.

Exit Scena Tertij Enter Achomates. Acho.

VVhat intercedent chance hath made his care So slacke in the performance? by heaven I feare, Delayes will proue delusions of my hopes And that homebred Mercurian Selymus, VVill split the expectation of my blisse, Forefend it Mahomet, or I shall be A sad revenger of indignitie. How now? vvhat speakes this bold intrusion? Enter a Messenger. Messen. Health to Achomates from Baiazet. Acho. From Baiazet? vnfold thy welcome newes, How fares our Noble Father? Messen. In full health; And wils you thus by mee: to muster vp Your surest forces, and with moderate hast, Repaire vnto the Court, where you shall find Employments worthy of a valorous mind. Achom. To muster armes? can'st thou surmise the cause? Messen. VVith confidence I dare not; but tis sayd, Against that haughtie Noble Selymus, VVho of the Tartar King implored ayd, To an vncertaine end: himselfe giues out To fight with Hungary, and stretch the bounds Of the old Turkish regiment; But fame With panting voice, bids Baiazet beware, And whispers in his eare, he is the foe, Proud Selymus intends to overthrow. Acho. Enough, regreet our Father with our love Tell him wee shall not sleepe to his command; Exit Fly nimbly backe: dares the audacious boy, Trouble the world with his tempestuous armes? Ile chastise him with yron whips of warre, If either strength or stratagems shall serue, To spoyle the gavvdy plumes of his high crest, I'le vse the strongest violence of both; I am swolne big with hate, and I could breake Vntimely passage with a wholesome stabbe To vent the monster strangled in my wombe. Father I come, he that detaines a Crowne Bequeath'd to me, must thunder-strike me downe. Enter Corcutus. Corcu. Buzzing reports haue pier't my studdy walles, And clog'd my meditations ayry wings, By which I mount aboue the mouing spheares And search the hidden closets of the heauen, I cannot liue retir'd, but I must heare Mine owne wrongs sounded in my troubled eare: VVhat? will my father falsifye that oath; In which he vowd successions right to mee, VVhen I resign'd my honors vp to him, He deepely swore; when the vprising Sunne Of his bright-shining royallty had runne It's compleat course through the whole heauen of state, And fainting dropt into the VVesterne lapse; My brightnesse next should throw it's golden beames, Vpon the worlds wide face, and ouer-peere The duskie clouds of hidden privacie, And shall Achomates succeed? Shall hee Shine in the spangled robes of Majesty? Then Baiazet is false, let it be so I am secur'd from a huge masse of woe. Yet Ile to th'Court, that when Achomates Shall spie mee, and remember but my due 'Twill staine his lustre with a blushing hue, Enter Baiazet, Cherseogles. Baia. My cares are growne to great to be compriz'd, Within the narrow compasse of my breast, Vice-roy of Greece, Ile powre into thy heart Part of my secrets; which being entred in, Locke them as close vp, as thou wouldst a sinne Committed, yet not knowne: I must impart Things worth thy faithfull silence. Chers. Worthy Sir, By the inclosure of my soule I sweareâ Baia. Ile not heare out thine oth, in briefe 'tis thus The Bassaes are all false and loue not vs; Nor doth my brain sicke fury prompt me thus, I read it in their gestures, conventicles, Actions, and counsells, my suspitious eye Hath found a great breach in their loyalty. Chers. Surely this cannot bee. Baiazet By heauen 'tis true, Each man that guards mine honour is my foe, Ile shake these splendant robes of Majesty From my ore-burden'd shoulders, and to ease My selfe, bequeath them to Achomates. Cherse. Achomates? Baia. Euen he, vnlesse the voyce Of the whole Citie interdict my choice. Enter Isaacke, Mesithes, Mustapha. Cherse. Heere comes the Bassaes, Sure I see bad newes Pourtrai'd on the Index of their fronts. Baia. Bad newes? We haue out-liu'd good dayes too long, We can expect no other, come vnclaspe Volumes of mischiefes, and make deafe my eares With an infused multitude of cares. Bassaes. Young Selymus hath crost Danubius floud, And seiz'd vpon the Provinces of Thrace, And with a Navie plow'd the Euxine Sea. Baia. Peace bellowing night-rauens, with how cheerefull noise Their puffing lungs croke out the balefull note, Are these the warres 'gainst Hungary? you powers Of heauen, brush off your cloddy patience, If you but winke at these notorious crimes, I'le say you dare not check our stubborne times. Well as yet, I'le make vse of his pretence Vize-roy of Greece, beare you this Embassie To that suspected Traytor Selymus, Tell him the warres 'gainst th'Hungarian foe, Are full of dangers and approued harmes, Never attempted by our Ancestors, Without repulse or damage bid him dismisse His rough Tartarian youth, then if he stand Vnmou'd and stiffe, feigne vengeance is at hand. Make thy best speed. Cherse. I shall, 'twill be well done To reconcile a Father and a Sonne. Baia. Thought he tumultuous vprores could deserue The favour of his Prince: h'as troad awry, And mist the path that leades to Majestie. These bright Imperious ornaments shall grace No rebell-monster, nor base runne-away. My resolution's firme, it shall not be; Bassaes, this day an Herauld shall proclaime In the worlds care, my great successours name. Are you content? Exit. Mustapha calls in an Herauld. Bassaes. We are. Baiaz. Call forth an Herrauld. Isaack. As our alleageance bindes vs wee'le obey. But what we graunt, the Souldiers will gaine-say. Aside.

Baiazet the second by the appointment of our great Prophet Mahomet, the onely Monarch of the World, a mighty God on earth, an inuincible CÃ¦sar, King of all Kings, from the East vnto the West, Gouernour of Greece, Sultan of Babylon, Soueraigne Of Persia and Armenia, triumphant Tutor of Ierusalem, Lord possessour of the Sepulcher of the Crucified God, subuerter and sworne enemie of the Christians, and of all that call vpon Christ; proclaimeth Achomates his second sonne next and immediate successour. An alarum of Trumpets Within. None but Baiazet, none but Baiazet. Baiaz. By heauen they are corrupted: none but I? 'Tis no loue borne to me that moues this cry. Mesith. Great Baiazet the cause why they deny This iust proposall, riseth from an vse And customary licence long obseru'd; To wit, when their crown'd Emperour is dead, The interpos'd vacation is a time Of lawlesse freedome: then they dare to spoile The Iewish Marchants of their traffick wares, And prey vpon all strangers: so that should Your Honour be conferr'd vpon your sonne Whilst you your selfe yet breath, then should they loose The long expected gaines; therefore refuse What you propos'd. Baiaz. If that be all the cause, Wee'le giue them such a Kingly donatiue, As doubly shall buy out those ill-got spoiles Fiue hundred thousand Duckets, if they please With my free choise to crowne Achomates, Proclaim'd to be their due. A flourish of Trumpets. Herauld. Baiazet the second by appointment of our great Prophet Mahomet, &amp;c. proclaimeth that hee'le attribute 500. Thousand Duckats if you yeeld alleageance To Achomates his successour. Trumpets sound againe. Within. None but Baiazet, none but Baiazet. Baia. Achomates I sent for, how hee'le disgest These grosse illusions, I may iustly feare: By this I had discourag'd Selymus, And kill'd his hopes; by this I had cut off The growth of hate, and choked discords seed. Exit. Enter Mustapha with a Messenger to the other Bassaes. Mustaph. Beare this to Selymus with thy best care. Mesith. And this. Giue him Letters. Isaack. And this: fly, let thy winged speed Returne a suddaine answere, elie we bleed. Exeunt. Scena Quinta. Enter Selymus, Tartarian King. Attendants. Tartar. Goe on braue Prince; Lead on thy marshal'd troupes, Degrade the Turkish Monarch, let him faint At the deepe wounds, which thy reuengefull hand Shall print vpon the bosome of his land. Goe on; Me thinks I see Victoria sit Triumphant on thy steely Burganet. Exit Tartarian King. Selym. Farewell; now I will meete thee Baiazet With a careere as free as if Heauens Ioue Had bid me goe: bespeake the stoutest gods To take thy part; tell them that thou must meete A Selymus, who when the warres are done, Will scale the Forts and Castles of the Sunne, Breake vp the brazen gates of Acheron, And bury Nature with the world together. Captaines leade on; Now shall the sword and fire By publique ruines crowne my iust desire. Sleepe Hungary, I'le not breake off thy rest With the vnwelcome Musick of my Drummes; I'le turne the edge of my reuengefull sword Vpon the bosome of my natiue soyle; There dwels the motiue of my Tragick warres, Whose ruthlesse sad Catastrophe shall wound Posterity in vs: Infants shall mourne Ouer their Fathers tombs as yet vnborne. But who comes here? I'le meete him. Noble Vize-roy. Enter Cherseogles. Cherseo. Peace and health to Selymus. Selym. Health, but not peace, whilst yonder light can see Mortalls, whom Turkish force could ne're subdue. Cherseo. Yet what if Baiazet our honour'd Lord Bid you roule vp those flaxen signes of warre, And sheath the sword drawne forth against his foe? When duty sayes obey, what shall say no. Selym My courage and a proud contempt of all Corriuall Nations, could send back a no, Able to fright a Parliament of gods. It could so: but if Baiazet gaine-say My plumy valour flags, my thoughts gaue way. Cherseo Then thus he wills you to discard your force, And send the black Tartarians to their home, Withall averring the Hungarian foe (Against whose power, you haue summon'd Armes) Is full of strength and power, ne're oppos'd Without the bitter downefall of our side. Nor would the worlds great Monarch Baiazet Empaire his fame so much, as to be sayd, He tam'd a Foe by Tartars borrowed ayd. Selym. Ha: I am vilely non-plust. Courteous Vize-roy Returne our duty back to Baiazet, Euen in the humblest termes wit can inuent, Tell him he hath a sonne of that high spirit, As doth detest a cowardly retreat. Were all the dead Heroes of our foes All that are now, and all that are to come Met in one age, I'de face them drum to drum. Bid our deare Father be secure of me And my proceedings: then true valour shines Most bright, when busied in the great'st designes. Is not this answere faire? Cherseo. Most true: and yet 'Twill proue distastfull. Selym. No, it cannot be: If there be too much valour in this breast, Blame him that plac't it there, euen Baiazet. My vertues and my bloud, are both deriu'd From his first influence, and I must either hate Disgracefull calumn's, or degenerate. Cherseo. All this I'le tell your Father, yet hee'le rest As much vnsatisfied as at the first, He will expect the head-strong pride of youth Should strike low sayle to his graue providence. Selym. And so it shall: sage Vize-roy I obey, And reuerence his counsell more, then feare An host of armed foes: tell him I'le come To his Court gates with neither man nor drum. Cherseo. I'le tell it him with ioy, which when he heares, Hee'le be disburden'd of a thousand feares. Selym. Remember my just duty: 'tis no matter, I will retaine that till I come my selfe. I am not out-reach'd yet by all these trickes, My hopes are farther strong, I'le to the Court With a close martch, in no submissiue sort, And steale vpon them: Instantly I goe To meete my Father, but a subtill foe. As he goes out, a Messenger meetes him, giues him the Letters. Messen. Good health to Selymus. Selym Good health: From whom? Messen. Isaack, Mesithes, Mustapha salute you. Selym. Those good Trinm vri what is't they speake? Opens the Letters. 1 (To feede on hopes is but a slender dyet) 'Tis short, but full of weight: to feede on hope Is but a slender diet. Let it be. Descants.

Isaack I am thine, And come to finish vp our great designe. Exit. Scena Sexta. Enter Achomates solus. Achom. Vnquiet anguishments and iealous feare Fly from my thoughts, like night before the Sunne: I'me lifted to the highest Spheare of ioy, My top inuelopt in the azure cloud, And starry rich habiliments: my feete Set rampant on the face of Natures pride, The rarest worke weau'd by her handmayd Art Cloathes my soft pleasures, I'me as great as Ioue, Onely I rule below, he raignes aboue. Oh! the vnspoken beauty of a Crowne, Whose empty speculation mounts my soule Vp to an heauenly Paradise of thoughts. Father, I come that thou may'st crowne my head, Whilst apprehensiue reason stands amaz'd, Amidst the blisfull shades of sweet conceit. Then I'le call back my wandring intellect From dreames, and those imaginary ioyes, I'le teach my soule to twine about a Crowne To sweat in raptures, to fill vp a Throne With the bigge-swelling lookes of Majestie, I'le amble through a pleasures Labyrinth, And wander in the path of happinesse, As the true obiect of that faculty. Great Baiazet I come. Thou must descend From Honours high Throne, and put off thy right To build me vp an heauen of choyse delight. Exit. Scena Septima. Enter Mesithes, Mustapha, Isaack. Mesith. The Emperour begins to smell deceit. I know by his ill lookes and sparkling eye That he affects vs not. Musta. I doubt as much. Young Selymus ha's wrong'd our loyalty In his so slack proceedings; we were rash And indiscreetly-forward in consent, When we ioyn'd on to raise his gouernment. Isaack. Peace, 'tis too late to chide at what is done, We haue so deepely waded in the streames Of those procellous plots, nor can reuoke Repentant footsteps, or securely creepe Back to the Throne of safety, 'tis now good To venture on, and swim quite through the flood. Here comes the Emperour. Enter Bajazet and Asmehemedes. Baia. Attend vs Bassaes. Ar't sure hee's dead? Asm. Mahometes is dead. There's nothing mouing of him but his soule, And that robd of his body by this hand. Baia. Enough. That soule reuiues to see him dead That wrong'd the body; Oh! my bloudy heart, Must in his frenzy act an horrid part. Follow thy Prince to hell. Stabs him. Asmeh. To death! Oh deuillish ingratitude: I'me slaine. I dye. Moritur. Baia. And iustly: would each foe And Traytor to my state were thwarted so. Bassaes conuay this hated body hence, The sight of that damn'd villaine moues offence: They carry him out. Now pause a while my soule, and reckon vp What obstacles are yet to be remou'd? Achomates must stay the peoples leasure. Corcutus dally with Mineruaes Nimphes. The last and worst, proud Selymus shall dye. Thus I'le compose a firme security. Enter Bassaes with Cherseogles. Baia. Arriu'd already noble Cherseogles? You'r carefull in our cause: but speake the newes From our pert Souldier. What meanes Selymus? Cherseo. To track the path backward from whence he came, To strip himselfe of martiall ornaments, And to fill vp the duty of a Sonne, Come visite you in low submission. Baia. These are too fairely promis'd, to be meant, Ambition hath already chain'd his soule Too surely in the captiue bonds of pride, Then that he now should cloath his stately hopes In the plaine sordid weedes of penitence, He doth but varnish o're some treacherous plot In this smooth answere: come, wee'le leade along To our Imperiall seat of Constantine, That strongly fortified, we need not feare The weake attempts an home-bred foe can dare. Exeunt Bajazet and Cherseogles. Mesith. Ha! we are sweetly plung'd, if cold despaire Benumme his youthfull courage, and he faint, Mustaph. VVould I were fairely rid of all these cares, Isaack. Dejected Cowards: are you not asham'd Thus to giue vp the goale of dignity To heartlesse feare? Here comes the Messenger. VVhat newes from Selymus? Messen. Euen nothing certaine: Ambiguously he promis'd to be here As soone as I. Mesith. I'st euen so? Musta. We are quite dash'tâvndone. Isaacke Lift vp your downe-cast spiritsâwho comes here? Mesith. Who? Selymus? Enter Selymus. Musta. Where? sweete Isaack doe not tell him, That we were sending forth faith's latest breath. Isaac. Enough, I will notâhappy Selymus. Bassaes. Long liue great Selymus. Sely. We thanke you friends: Your care hath fostered vp our infant hopes Beyond the pitch of expectation. We heare that Baiazet is going now From hence to Constantinople; my men Lie closely ambusht in the middle way, Close by a ruinous city, there expect A sudden on-set, but till then farewell. When we meete next, our ensignes wau'd on high, Shall shine like Meteors blazing in the skie. Exit. Isaac Fortunes best care goe with thee. Mesith. Braue boy y'faith. Musta. I shall adore him whilest I breath for this. Isaac Againe in heart? Let's follow Baiazet, come lads away, The sunne of all his glory sets this day. Exeunt Enter Selymus with souldiers. Selym. Come on the honored youth of Tartary, My brothers and joynt sharers of my woe, Draw forth the weapons of inflam'd reuenge, Against this horrid monsters Tyranny; I seeme like Romes great CÃ¦sar, when opprest With Pompeys grating malice he led forth His noble French-men through the snowy Alpes, I haue my Curio Isaacke in the Court, And Cherseogles like grim Catoes ghost, Soothes the rough humour of fierce Baiazet, These mens examples, were we faint and loath Would set sharpe spurs vnto our slow pac'd wrath, And whet our dull-eged anger: but I see In your smooth brow perfect alacrity; We stand to thwart the passage of a feind, Through whose wide yawning throat hath coasted downe. The blood of Princes, in continuall streames, Ha's fed and pampered vp his appetite With the abhor'd destruction of his owne, And glutted on the blood of innocents. Stood wee like marble statues in his way, And had no vse of policy and wit, Our Irefull Prophet Mahomet would send Sence, life, and valour through our stony joynts, That we might ruinate this gastly bore, Made by some hellish fury to confound The order of this wondred Vniuerse. Ile grapple with the monster, hee's at hand, If you stand firme, the Common Wealth may bee, A slaue to Baiazet, but Ile liue free. Enter Baiazet, Cherseogles, Isaack, Mesithes, Mustapha. Baia. No Drumme nor Trumpet hath disturb'd the ayre, Within the reach of mine attention. Isaac. And I admire it, 'twere a miracle If that ambitious boy intend no harme. Omnes. What noyse is that? A confused noyse of exclamation within, arme, arme, arme. Soldiers. Helpe Baiazet, the vauntgard's almost slaine, The Tartars lay in ambush. Baia. What? so neere? Set vp our standard, Ile giue battell here, Hang out defiance, scorne, and proud contempt, Write in the blood-red colours of your plumes, Summon our Army Enter a drum From these skirmishes, Speake out the traitors doome in thine alarmes. Thought he to daunt our courage? Drum sounds. Enter souldiers seuerally, dropping in sweating, as from fight. Valiant souldiers; When I behold the manner of this warre Then treason copes with awfull Majestie, A gracelesse sonne, with his owne aged Sire, Me thinks to bid you fight, were full as vaine As to bid heauy clouds fall downe in raine: But when I view the Chaos of the field, And wild confusion striking valour dead, I cald you, not (as Captaines doe to boyes) To read a lecture of encouragement, But that your auncient vertue may be showne In this my last defence: I wish to dye Reueng'd, that death sorts best with Majesty, Drums sounding, A confused noyse, with clashing of armour. Exeurrunt Baiazet, and Selymus. Baia. Selymus? Selym. Baiazet? Baiaz. Joue lend me but a minutes patience. Vnnaturall sonne. Selym. Vncharitable Father. Baia. Father? My sword shall hew that title off, And cut in twaine kindreds continued line, By which thou canst deriue thy blood from mine. Abortiue monsterâthou first breath of sinne, We had but slender shaddowes of offence, Till thou creptst forth to the offended light, The very masse, and stocke of villanie. Crimes in all others, are but thy influence. Nature ha's planted viprous crueltie, In thy darke breast, the scandall of her workes Her error, and extract perfection Of vices; the first well-head of bad things From whence the world of ills draw their weake springs, Selym Then heare me speake too: you haue bin to me No Father, but a sowre Pedanticke wretch, One that with frosty precepts, striu'd to kill The flaming heate of my ambitious youth, As vainely as to strangle fire with straw: You sit so dayly houering on your Throne, As if you'd hatch new Monarchies to feed The hungry gulfe of your vnbridled pride, Y'aue surfetted on titles, y'aue ingrost Honor, you are the moth of eminence, And liberall fortunes answered your desires; You had deflow'rd th'infinitie of Crownes, With your adulterate ambition, Y'are Soveraignties horse-leach, and haue spild The blood of State, to haue your owne veines fild. Baia. Hold, hold thy venom'd tongue, if there be hid More of this kind vn-vttred, Ile rip vp Thy full fraught bosome, and to saue mine eare Mine eyes shall ouerview what I'le not heare. Darst thou fight Traitor? Selym. Dare I be cal'd a King? Dare I vnsheath my sword, or gather might? If I dare ought of these, I dare to fight. Baia. Guard thee, I'de not omit the sweete desire And pleasure of revenge, were heauen my hyre. They fight, Selymus is beaten off, Baiazet pursues, re-enters at another doore. The slaue has scapt the power of my wrath, Midst the disseuer'd troups of scattered foes I lost him in a smoky cloud of dust, So thicke as if the tender Queene of loue, Had wrapt her brat Ãneas from my sight. Enter Isaacke, Mesithes, Mustapha. Isaack Ioy to my Liege, of his last victory. Mesith. The bold Tartarians flew like fearefull Harts Before the hunters rage. Baia. So let them fly; Heaven raine downe vengeance on their cursed heads; It is our honour that the frighted slaues Enter a dwarffe Owe their liues deerest safeties to their heeles. How now, whence come you? Dwar. From yonder hayricke Sir. Baia. Didst thou see Selymus when he fled the field? Dwar. No indeed, I was two farre crept in. Baia. O you are braue attendants. Let's forward in our journey; these affaires Achomates must know, his golden wish, The people haue delayd, perhaps heele frowne, And trample filiall duty vnder feete As this hath done: but let them storme their fill Vertu's not shipwrackt in a sea of ill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quinti Scena Prima. Enter Achomates alone, with a bloody sword in his hand. Achom. An honour'd Legate? an Ambassadour? As if that title like MedÃ¦as charme Could stay the vntam'd spirit of my wrath, Had he bin sent a messenger from heauen, And spoke in thunder to the slauish world; If he had roar'd one voice, one sillable Crosse to my humour, I'de a searcht the depth Of his vnhallowed bosome, and turne out His heart, the prophane seate of sawcy pride. Slaine an Ambassador? no lesse: 'tis done, And 'twas a noble slaughter, I conceiue A joy ineffable to see my sword Bath'd in a blood so rare, so precious, As an Ambassadours; must we be tolde Of times delayes, and opportunities? That the base soldier hath gaine-sayd our blisse? Thought Baiazet, his son so cold, so dull, So jnnocently blockish, as to heare An Embassie most harsh and grossely bad The people to deny me? we contemne With strange defiance Baiazet, and them. Scena Secunda. Enter Isaacke, Mesithes, Mustapha. Mesith. Mischiefe on mischiefe, all our hopes are dead, Slaine in the haplesse fall of Selymus. Mustapha I thinke the deuills fought for Baiazet And all the infernall haggs; how could he else With a confused army, and halfe slaine, Breake the well-ordered rancks of a strong foe? Mesith. And vnexpected toânow Isaacke! what Sadly repenting for thy last misdeeds. Plots and conspiracies against thy Prince? Faith we must hang togetherâ Isaacke. Good Mesithes 'Tis nothing so: they say Achomates Disdaining to be mockt out of his hopes, And most desired possession of the Crowne, Ha's in contempt of Baiazet and all, Slaine the Ambassador, and vowes revenge On euery guilty agent in his wrong. Mustaph. I lookt for that; and therefore first shranke back, VVhen Baiazet made choyce of one to send On such a thankelesse errand as that was. Mesith. Grant the report be true: what's that to vs? Isaack Fame in mine eare nere blab'd a sweeter tale, This shall redeeme our lowd dejected hopes, To their full height, no more; be it my charge, To chase out the eventâwhats this comes here? Mustaph. Vpon my life, the body of the slaine Ambassador. Enter the Ambassadors followers with the dead body Mesith. 'Tis so. Isaacke VVe greet your friends, And your sad spectacle. Followers. Tis sad enough To banish peace and patience, from each breast That owes true loyalty to Baiazet. Isaacke And so it shall; lay downe the iniur'd corps. Achomates ha's wrong'd his Fathers loue, To grosly, in the murder euen of him That bore his sacred person, and should stand Inviolably honor'd by the law Of men and nations, But here comes Baiazet. Enter Baiazet and Cherseogles. Baia. A tragicke spectacle? whose trunke is this? Follow. The body of your slaine Ambassador. Baia. Slaine? by what cursed violence? what slaue Durst touch the man that represented me? Follow. Achomates. Baia. Achomates? Follow. The same Highly displeas'd with the vnexpected newes Of a deniall from the peoples mouth, His reason slipt in fury, and contempt Hath thus abus'd your gracious Majesty. Withall, he threatned to maintaine this sinne With force of armes, and so resolu'd to winne Your Crowne, without such tarrianceâ Baia. Oh! no more, I am vnfortunate in all my blood. Hath he thus guerdon'd my faire promises, My dayly sweat and care, to further him, And fix him in the paradise of joy? Nations cry out for vengeance of this fact, I'le scourge this blacke impiety to hell. Muster our forces to the vtmost man, Once more I'le bury this my aged corps In steely armour, and my coloured crest Like a bright starre shall sparkle out reuenge Before the rebels faint amazed eyes. Loose not a minute, Bassaes hence, be gone The chance of warre, or resolutely die. Feare no crosse blow, for with this hand I moue The wheele of Fate: and each successe shall runne Euen with our pleasures, till our hopes are spun Vp to their full perfection, this dayes light That lookes so cheerefully, shall see as bright As it, my crowne and glory. Makes a stand. As they march on, enter Isaack Bassa. What stranger's this? my blessed Genius haunts me. Isaack I take thee in with open loue. What speakes thy Presence? Isaack. Good newes to Selymus. Selym. From whom? Isaack. From Baiazet. Selym. 'Tis strange if good. Isaack. And full as good as strange. March quickly hence. I'le tell you as we walke; if constant Chance Smile on our project e're this Sunne goe downe, We may salute you with a glorious Crowne. Selym. I follow euen to death. Grand Mars to thee I'le build an Altar if thou prosper me. Exeunt. Scena quarta. Enter Achomates and Souldiers. Achom. Revenge my black impiety; each brow Seemes with a scornfull laughter to deride Those empty Menaces of Baiazet. And Baiazet is not our Father now, Sith he hath wrong'd the duty of a Sonne, But a scorn'd Enemy whose prostrate soule Shall make a step by which I will ascend Vp to the heauenly throne of heauenly state, If you but lend your helpe and free consent. Souldiers. Leade vs along the misty bankes of hell Through Seas of danger, and the house of death, We are resolu'd to follow, and by one To second each step of Achomates. Achom. This resolution is as great as iust, Continue it braue spirits: he's a slaue That hauing sinn'd, dares not defend his sinne, The world shall know I dare: For though our cause Be wrong, yet we'le make good the breach of lawes. Exeunt. Scena quinta. Enter Baiazet and Corcutus. Corcut. Would I had slept with Trizham; and that hand That strangled Mahomet, had stopt my breath, Rather then liue to see my selfe thus wrong'd. Baia. Despaire not sweet Corcutus, what I promis'd I'le keepe most true, and here againe I vow When I am dead, this honour to thy brow. I haue call'd home that rebell Selymus, Onely to tame a Traytor: And that done, We haue no other heire, no other sonne Beside Corcutus, to whose free command VVe doe bequeath the duty of this land. Enter Mesithes and Mustapha. Is Isaack not return'd? Mesith. My Liege he is. Mustaph. And Selymus with him. Enter Selymus and Isaack, as they enter speake. Baia. Let them approach. Isa. Let your high spirit shrink below it selfe In a dissembled shew of penitence. Selym. Tush I can bow, as if my ioynts were old, And tumble at his feet. Isaack. Practise your skill. Selymus falls at Bajazets feet. Baiaz. Lesse shew, and more good meaning Selymus. Arise: these crouching feates, giue slender proofes Of inward loyalty. Selym. Right noble Father, Mine expedition to auenge your cause Vpon the head of proud Achomates, Be my iust triall. Baia. Hast then: May thy arme By breathlesse treason raise vp a full ioy, And turne that monster back vnto the earth From whence it leapt, a most prodigious birth. Selym. VVe flie to the performance; who both dare And will correct his boldnesse: now we tread The path to honour, and me thinkes I heare The peoples Viuat, Eccho in mine eare. Exit Selymus with the Bassaes. Baia. New insolence: The Bassaes slipt away, How the obsequious villaines As if he were their Godhead. Cherseo. I suspect Some plotted mischiefe, else they durst not leaue Your person thus vnguarded. Baia. Plot and hang. We weigh not all their treasons at a straw, One must not rule too long, 'tis subiects law. Exeunt. Passe ouer the stage Bassaes and Souldiers carrying Selymus aloft, and crying out Long liue Selymus, Viuat Selymus, Magnificent Emperour of the Turkes. Exeunt. Enter Bajazet and Cherseogles. Baia. Hell and the furies vex their damned soules. What people? Hah? what Nation is't we liue in? Is't our State and Monarchy? good gods Two Emperours at once. Liue Selymus? Can slauish vassailes thus supplant their Prince? What's this enshrines my head? a type for fooles To fleare at a diuided ornament: Faile not my sense and courage, let me liue To finde my selfe againe. Vize-roy of Greece, Didst thou not see a Baiazet withdraw And vanish hence? tell thou most faithfull man, What is become of that forgetfull name? Or who hath stole it from me? Selymus Oh that damn'd villaine with his treacherous plot, Hath rob'd me of that glory. Death a sense If t'haue a soule of Adamant or Steele, Else had that hated noise reft it in twaine: What art thou? or whence com'st thou? Enter Mesithes. Mesith. From a Prince. Baia. Yet I beleeue thee. Mesith. From thine enemie. Baia. Yet I beleeue thee. Mesith. From the Emperour. Baiaz. And I beleeue thee still; yet slaue thou liest, These parts must know no Emperour but me, Vnlesse base vsurpation hath stept-vp Vnto my chaire of honour. Right, 'tis so: 'Tis so indeede. Well then, what will your Emperour? Mesith. That by my hand you yeeld him vp his crowne! Baiaz. Traytor his crowne? so: now I am resolu'd. I haue forgone my selfe, else had this hand Tore out thy spotted heart, and that one word Of yeelding had beene cause enough to spoyle Thee and thy generation. Heartlesse slaue, Why sneak'st thou from our presence? stay, behold Here I commend this gorgeous ornament, These trappings to thy Emperour, as full Bestead with curses as my heart with woes, That it may clogge his eares, and vex his head With daily terrours. Hence thy Prince is sped. Exit Mesith. Vize-roy of Greece, to thee our last farewell, Thou worthiest truest best deseruing man, That euer made vs happy: if thy faith Respect me, not my fortune, Deo this charge, Fly to Achomates, and rather ayde Him then this faithlesse Bastard Selymus, The scandall of our race, the marke for heauen To shoote reuenge. But all in vaine, I striue to word away my inward paine. Cherseo. Nor this nor that I'le fauour, may I speed Baiazet shall liue to see both bleed. Exit. Baia. Maske vp thy brightnesse PhÅbus, louely night, Hurle thy thick mantle ouer all the heauens, Let this black day for euer be forgot In the eternall registers of time: Which of you sacred powers are not asham'd To see a Prince so sinfully abus'd By his owne issue and vnreueng'd. Enter Selymus and Bassaes. But stand we, who comes here? a face of brasse. Else would it blush: now thou Saturnine Ioue, Thou God of great men, thunder that the world Drench'd all in sinne, may shake and feare the noyse That horrid scourge of villanies. Selym. Father? Baia. Slaue Auaunt: I feele a strong Antipathy T'wixt thee and me, thy sight makes my dead heart Distill fresh drops of bloud, and worke new smart. Exit. Selym. What furious Baiazet, and raging hot? I hugge the amorous pleasure that I feele Creepe through my ioynts: obserue our Father, Exeunt Bassaes. Else by some wilfull murder hee'le preuent My purpos'd proiect, I'de not loose the guilt Of his destruction for a crowne: heauen knowes I loue him better then to let him digge Himselfe a graue, whilst I may take the paines. Now mount my soule, and let my soaring plumes Brush the smooth surface of the Azure skie. Crowne in his hand. With this I charme obeysance from the world: Thou golden counterfeit of all the heauens; See how the shining starres in carelesse ranks Grace the composure; and the beauteous Moone Holds her irregular motion at the height Of the foure poles; this is a compleat heauen, And thus I weare it: but me thinks 'tis fixt But weakely on my brow, whilst there yet breath Any whose enuie once reflect on it, And those are three: the angry Baiazet, Puling Corcutus, proud Achomates: One of these three is car'd for, that's Corcutus Who ere the blushing morne salutes the Sunne, Shall be dispatcht by two most hideous slaues, Whom I haue bred a purpose to the fact: The other riuall, wise Achomates, I'le beare aside by force of men and armes, Which ready Mustred, but attend the stroke, Then attend our Fathers. Enter Hamon. Here's one deales for him, Shall send him quick to hell. It is decreed. He that makes lesser greatnesse soone shall bleed, Hamon draw neere, most welcome my deare Hamon, What guesse of your patient Baiazet? Is he all healthfull? Hamon. No my gracious Prince. Neither his body nor his minde is free From miserable anguish. Selym. A sad case. Hamon I loue him, and would rid him from't. Were I so skill'd in naturalls as you. Hamon. All that my art can worke to cure his griefe Shall be applied. Selym. Vnapprehending foole: I must speake broader. Hamon is he ill In minde and body both? Hamon. Exceeding ill. Selym. Then should I thinke him happier in his death, Then in so hatefull life and so weake breath. Hamon. And that's the readier way to cure his ill. Selym. (H'as found me now) but Hamon can thy Art Reach to the cure? Hamon. With ease diligence. Selym. Then let it. Hamon. I'me yours. Exit Hamon. Selym. Walke, and thy paines, Shall be rewarded highly, with the like As thou bestowest on Baiazet: the Court Makes it a fashion now first to bring the event About, and then hang vp the instrument. Scena Sexta. Enter Cherseogles aboue disguised like a common Souldier. Cherseog. Thus Cherseogles hast thou wound thy selfe, Out of thy selfe to act some fearefull plot, By which the Authors of this publique woe, Shall skip into their graues, it is confirm'd A deede of lawfull valour to defeat Those of their liues, that rob'd the world of peace. On this side the false hearted Selymus With his confederate Bassaes lie incampt Iust opposite the proud Achomates; The Sunne now sunke into the Westerne lap, Bids either part, vnlace their warlike helmes Vntill to morrow light where both intend The hazard of a battell: but you powers That with propitious cares, tender the world And vs fraile mortals, helpe me to preuent A generall enemie by the fall of some; Assist my spirits in a deed of blood, Cruell, yet honest and austeerely good. Who? Selymus? as I expected. Enter Selymus. Selym. What? A souldier thus licentious in his walkes, A stranger? Ha? What art thou? Cherseo. A sworne friend, a seruant to thy greatnesse. Selym. Then returne Backe into thy rankes and orders no edict From me hath ratified this liberty, To scout at randome from the standing campe. Cherseo. 'Tis true my honour'd Lord, nor haue I dared For some poore triuiall prey thus to remoue My selfe, but for a cause of greater weight The ruine of our enemies. Selym. How's that? The ruine of our enemies? Cher. No lesse; The quicke fall of great Achomates Can worke it. Sely. Soldier as thou hop'st to liue, Mocke not my thoughts with false and painted tales, Of a supposed stratagem. Cherse. I sweareâ Sely. What wilt thou sweare? Cherse. By all the heauenly powers I speake the trueth, and if I faile in ought, Grind mine accursed bodie into dust. Sely. Enough, vnfold the meaning and the way By which this happy project must be wrought. Cher. 'Tis thus; at the twelfth houre of this blacke night, Achomates I haue induc'd to walke Foorth to this valley weapon'd, but vnmand, In expectation of your presence there, Where being met, heele vrge a single fight, Twixt you and him: after a stroake or two, I haue ingag'd my selfe closely to start From ambush, and against you take his part. Selym. Worse then a deuill, should my heart Haue made that promise with my tongue; But heauen beare witnesse that my inward thoughts Labour his welfare only, whom you powers Haue prou'd most worthy, therefore onely yours. Meete but this foe, whom I haue flattered thus, To his destruction: and great Selymus Shall see my strength imployed to offend Achomates, and stand thy faithfull friend. Sely. Oh wert thou faithfullâ Cherse. If I shrinke in ought That I professe, death shall strike me to the grave. So thriue all falshood, and each perjur'd slaue. Sely, Th'ast wonne our credit, beare a noble mind About thee, then to find me forward trust This night when sleepe triumphant hath subdu'd Her wakefull subjects, and the midnight clocke, Sounded full twelue, in this appointed place, Expect my presence, and till then adiew Our next shall be a tragicke enterview. Enter Achomates. Cherseo. The first is car'd forâhere a second comes, Assist me thou quicke jssue of Ioues braine, And this one night shall make their labors vaine. Achom. It shal be so, my feares are too to great, To joyne all in one on-set: a strong band Shall with a circle hem the traytor round, And intercept the passage of their flight; How now? from whence com'st thou? what at thou? Cher. A Lieg-man to Achomates. Achom. To mee? Cher. Yes noble Prince, and one whose life is vowd To further your desert, and therefore yours. Achom. We thanke you, and pray you leaue vs. Cher. I can vnfold an easie stratagem, Would crowne the hopes of great Achomates. Achom. What means the fellow? Cher. To secure your state By Selymus his fall. Achom. What i'st thou breath'st? Speake it againe, for many carefull thoughts Possesse my soule, that euery blessed voice, Steales in the passage twixt my eare and hast, By Selymus his fall, to secure my state? Cherse. I can: Achom. Delude me not and I will raine Such an vnmeasured plenty in thy lap, Heape such continuall honors on thy head That thou shouldst shrinke, and stagger with the weight. Cherse. Iudge of the meanes; this night I haue induc'd Young Selymus to walke foorth in this groue, At the twelfe houre, in hope to meete you here, Where hauing vrg'd a combat, and both met In eager conflict I haue pawn'd my vow, To rush from yonder thicket, and with him Ioyre against you. Acho. Villaine. Cher. And deuils had, My heart made promise with my tongue, But heauen beare witnesse that my soule affects None but Achomates, try but my faith, And meete this foe, whom I haue bayted thus, With golden hopes, and you will find my deed In your defence all promise shall succeed. Acho. I'm resolu'd souldier, when day is past, And the full fancies of mortalitie Busie in dreames and playing visions, At the sad melancholly houre of twelue, Ile meete thee in this plaine. Cher. And you shall find Me here before you. Achom. Be so; Who denyes To strike in time, can seldome hope to rise, Exit Cher. These two will meete, and I must take both parts. Now for a tricke to send them both to hell, In the full growth of expectation; Heauens know they haue deseru'd it then 'twould be An happy murder: and behold the men Enter Bassaes Whom I haue decreed should doe it, once againe I must betake me to my former note; Health to the friends of our great Emperor, The three strong pillars that vphold true worth. Isaacke Sir, your intrusion is vnseasonable. Musta. And your salute, impardonably bold. Cher. Perhaps the newes I bring, may frame excuse For both these faults. Mesith. Speke out thy mind in briefe. Cher. Then thus: to night here present on this plaine, You may encounter two fierce enemies, Achomates, and Cherseogles, both at the full stroake of twelue. Isaack How (Mesithes) we're blest. Musta. This night at twelue of the clocke? Cher. Vpon my lifeâ Omnes What shall we doe? Chers. But meete mee on this plaine At the appointed houre, and I will place You three aside, from whence you shall oppresse Your foes at vnawares. Mesith. Is it a match? Issac 'Tis done at twelue a clocke. Mustap. See thou proue faithfull. Chers. If I shrinke in ought That I professe, death strike me to the graue. So thriue all falshood and each perjur'd slaue. Exeunt Bassaes How easily base minds are drawne to strike Their foes at least aduantageâbeauteous morne, Pale witnesse to a thousand deeds of sinne Vaile vp thy light, that darkenesse may helpe on These blacke stratagems, and vnhallowed hands Strike in mistaken bodies, euen the soule Themselues adore, and cheerefully defend, But time growes fast vpon me, hit all right Two Princes, and three Bassaes dye this night. Scena Septima. Enter Corcutus with his Lute. Corcu. Heauen whither run these projects? is the thought Of man so sencelesse, void of wit, yet fraught With threatning ambition? to what end Doth this distempered madnesse headlong bend? Blesse me my Genius from these hated toyles Of murdering warfare, and these sweating broyles, Of watchfull policy; PhÅbus let it be That I may know no other god but thee. Learned experience sayes, ambiguous fates Vexe eminent fortunes, and he onely stands Without the beames of enuy, whom the hands Of some propitious power, hath ranckt below Those short delights that troubled thoughts doe know; A Crown's a golden marke, which being hit, Falls not alone, but off the head with it: Honors are smoakie, nothing, then let the Queene Of learning, great Minerua, and the nine Chast sisters, that adorne the Grecian hill, Devote me to themselues, but let me still Within Apollos sacred Temple sit, And spend my body to encrease my wit; Raigne Selymus, for I shall ne're thee hate, Thy supreame power, nor enuy thy state, Corcutus stands diuorced from a life, Engag'd to vaine ambition factious state, And emptie power of Kings; Hee's great in fame Not who seekes after, but neglects the same. Since thou hast grieu'd me PhÅbus, free my wit, That I may ease my griefe by speaking it; If thou deny'st fond god, twill be in vaine, Sorrow can sing, though thou not tune the straine. Sings to his Lute. Then thou sweete Muse from whence there flowes, words able to expresse our ill, Teach me to warble out my woes, and with a sigh each accent fill: Jnfuse my breast with dolefull straines, Whose heauy note may speake my paines, O let me sigh, and sighing weepe, Till might depriue my woes with sleepe. The pleasing murmurers of the ayre, that gently fanne each mouing thing, I being heard, straight doe repayre, and beare a burden whilst I sing, An heauy burden dolefull song, The fathers griefe the subiects wrong, O let me sigh, and sighing weepe, Till night beguiles my woes with sleepe. The grieued Flora hangs the head Of euery youthfull plant and tree And flowry pleasures are starke dead, at my lamenting melody, Then all you Muses helpe my straine To reach the depth of bitter paine. Oh let me sigh, and sighing weepe Till night beguiles my woes with sleepe. Me thinkes I heare the singing spheares, tune their melodious straines to mine, The deawie clouds dissolue in teares, as if they grieu'd to see me pine; Thus each thing ioynes to helpe my moane, Thus seldome come true sighs alone; Then let me sigh, and sighing weepe, Till night beguile my woes with sleepe. He sleepes: Then enter two murtherers Who slaying him, heare him away. Exeunt: Scena Octaua. Enter Cherseogles. Chers. A darke and heauy night, as if the gods Winckt at our projects, and had clad the heauens In a propitious blacke, to blesse my plot; Reuenge, to thee I dedicate this worke, And I will pamper thy wild appetite With blood and murther, thy dull slow pac't feet Shall caper to behold our fearefull sceanes Drencht in a scarlet Ocean, Tis full twelueâ I heare a quiet foot pace, and it beates Directly towards. 'Tis Selymus, Ioy of expectation. Enter Selymus Selym. Thou Queene of shades; Bright Cynthia, and you starry lampes of heauen, What spheare hath told you? oh y'are enuious all, And therefore hate to grace the time, in which I ruinate my latest foe; this is the sand On which I am to wrestle for a Crowne, And I am entred full of greedie lust, To meet my adverse champion; here's my god, Whom I adore with greater confidence Then all those beauties, Sunne, or Moone, or Starres That with malicious absence haue disrob'd, This gracious houre of i'ts due respect. Oh thou the silent darkenesse of the night, Arme me with desperate courage and contempt, Of godsâlou'd men, now I applaud the guile, Of our braue roarers which select this time, To drink and swagger, and spurne at all the powers Of either world, blest mortals, had that mother Strangled her other infant, white fac't day, And brought forth onely night, my limbs are stiffe, And I must bath them in my brothers blood, Ile steepe this grasse in a red purple goare, Scatter the carcasse peecemeale, and that done Ile reare a lasting monument, Ile signe A trophie, which inscrib'd, shall speake my deedes To after ages, that's my chiefe intent, Hee's coldly prays'd that's written innocent; VVhose there? my souldier? Cher. Souldier and slaue, great Prince at your command, Sely. I will jnoble thee place thee my second selfe In all my power for thy rare faith. VVhere's our Achomates? Cher. I heard one softly tracke full hitherwards, And thinke tis he; 'tis needfull that I meete him, And giue some proofe that I continue his, Else jealous of my faith, he will returne, And we be both deluded; when y'are met, Parley before you fight, till I prepare My selfe to runne vpon him vnawares, Meane while Ile goe to meete him. Exit Selymus. Goe, make hast, But if this base raskall should deceiue My trust? a trifleâmy nerues are plumped vp And fil'd with vigor, strong enough to fright, A million of such big backt, drowsie slaues; I heare them both approach. Enter Cherseogles and Achomates. Cherse. See where he stands, I shall not be slow To second your encounter being met, Parley before ye fight, till I prepare My selfe, to runne vpon him vnaware, Meane while I'le withdrawânow for my Bassaes, Exit Achom. A time of dismall blacknes, and my soule Is dull and heauy, as if enuious night, Striu'd to subdue my fatall watchfullnesse. But I haue rush'd vpon my foe: whose there? Sely. Answere thy Prince first I say, what art thou? Acho. He that vsurp's the title of a villaine. Sely. But he that weares it is a Saint, and such am I. Achom. Th'art a treacherous slaue. Sely. Achomates thou lyest, this night shall proue I shrinke not to vnmake what I haue done. Achom. Oh heauens so impudently bad? Selymus Good brother we know your vertues, one that Gayn country, gods, and men, Slew an Ambassadour which here we must reuenge. Achom. Hearke in thine eare, Ile whisper forth thy mischiefes, least the heauens Should teare and snatch them hence from my reuenge, In greedinesse of wrathâthey whisper. Enter Cherseogles, Isaacke, Mesithes, Mustapha. Cherse. See where they stand. Isaacke Achomates and Selymus? Cher. Both: They are two, we foure, lets runne vpon them, 'Tis very darke, be certaine in your aime, And all strike home. Omnes. A match. Mes. Isaack, and I will take the neerest. Must. And we the other. Cher. Strike home, and sure, and here's at them. Stab him. Selym. I haue the Crowne, and I will, Oh, oh, oh. stab him. Achom. Oh, Ã²Ã², O villaine I am slaine. vterque moritur. Cher. It is not Cherseogles we haue slaine. Isa. Not Cherseogles villaine, whom then? speak. They confer. Cher. Achomates and Selymus. Isaack. Ha. Cher. None other. Isaack. Hast thou betray'd vs so? Cher. Be silent, heare me. There lie the Captaines of both Armies dead, Breathlesse, and so stupid to neglect The vse of oportunities. Isaack. What vse? Cher. Are you not rich, wealthie in powerfull gold, Goe whilst the Souldiers lye thus destitute Of any Leader, frankly bribe both parts Buy their vnsetled loue at any rate, And creepe into their bosome, then in this Dead want and dearth of Princes, they will Cleaue to Isaack, and at length salute Isaack. Me Emperour? Cher. You apprehend it right. Isa. What blessed angell art thou? Cher. 'Tis no time for idle complement. Isaack. Thy counsel's good. I would not let slip this sweet occasion, For all the pretious plenty of the world. Come let's away. Cher. First make some quick dispatch with these now riualls. Isa. True, they'le not endure my Soueraignty. Hast no suddaine wits how to remoue them both? Cher. No wile but strength; are not we two? They are no more; we must encounter them, 'tis man to man: The match no whit vnequall. Isa. I am thine: I hate to haue co-partners in my state: There shall not breath a man whose enuious eye Dares looke a squint on my dread Maiestie. Mes. They that bring newes first, are still most welcome. Musta. Experience speakes it true. Mes. Let vs hast, now Selymus we come to gratulate Isaack. Stayâ Cherseo. Stand. Mes. How? Mustaph. What meanes this? Isaacke. Fate to your liues. They fight, Isaack is slaine. Musta. Sweet doings. Isaack. 'Tis no lesse, Sir witnesse this, Traytor I'me slaine. Moritur. Cherseog. Crosse fortune, wicked chance: But I must make the best of it. Is he dead? Mes. Villaine he is, and thy bad turne is next: What deuill did incite thee, to incite Isaack 'gainst friends? Iniurious slaue. Musta. Vrge him to no confession, till the rack Force from his closest thought vnwilling truth, He shall be doom'd for this notorious fact Vnto continuall paines, Hunger, oppression, want and slauery. Mes. That struck me full.âHaue at thee: Hold thou art victor. I haue met the price Of treason death, and as I hop'd to raise By blood, I fall, so haue I mist my scope, Delusion is the end of lawlesse hope. Moritur. Cherse. Mesithes stay one moment, art thou gone, I am not farre behinde I feele the blood By slow degrees ebb, from my fainting breast, I am heart struck, and wounded euen to death, A Sceane of slaughterthis.âO iust heauens Still I plighted faith to each of these, I wisht that if I fail'd in one, I vow'd Death would thus strike me, I haue gain'd my wish, Then you imperiall Fates that intercept The brittle courses of fraile mortality, Continue this firme iustice, and enact A constant law, that all false meaning hearts That thinke of oathes as of a puffe of winde, May as I doe, thus sinke into the graue My dying wish: so thriue each periur'd knaue. Moritur. Enter Souldiers. Sould. 1. The night ouerblowne, and fiue a clocke, I wonder at their absence; what are these Our Generalls murdered, our deere Selymus, With his three Bassaes, and Achomates, Whose bloody hand is guilty of this fact? Sould. 2. A trembling shakes me, 'twas some power That frown'd at our proceedings. Sould. 3. Baiazet is new borne to his Soueraignty. Sould. 4. Let's take their bodies, beare them hence in pompe Vnto their greatnesse, and aduise the foe Of their slaine Generall sterne Achomates, Sound peacefull rumours; we must resubmit To Baiazet, so heauen hath thought it fit. Exeunt. Scena Nona. Enter Bajazet and Haman with a Booke and Candle. Baiaz. Set downe the Booke and Candle, goe and prouide The Potion to preuent my Feauer-fit, Till when I meane to study: goe make ha? Exit Haman. Fortune I thanke thee, thou'rt a gracious Whore. Thy happy anger hath immur'd a Prince Within the walls of base security. Farewell thou swelling sea of Gouernment, On whose bright christall bosome floates along The grauelled vessell of proud Maiestie. Ambition empty all thy bagge of breath, Send forth thy blast among the quiet waues, And worke huge tempests to confound the Art Of the vsurping Pilate Selymus. Treason and enuie like to bickering windes, Shake the vnsetled fabrick of his State, That from my study windowes I may laugh, To see his broken fortune swallowed vp In the quick sands of danger, and the sayle Puft with the calme breath of flattering Chance, By furious whirle-windes rended into ragges, And peece-meale scattred through the Ocean: But peace my chiding spirit; Come thou man Of rare instinct, blest Author of a booke Takes the booke. Worthy the studies of a reading God, Thou do'st present before my wearied eyes, Tiberius sweating in his policies, Dull Claudius gaged by dull flattery, Nero vnbowelling Nobility, Galba vndone by seruants hardly good, Otho o're-whelm'd in loue, and drencht in blood, Vittellius sleeping in the chayre of State, Vespatian call'd to gouernment by Fate, Still as thy Muse doth trauell o're their age, A Princes care is writ in euery Page. Thus I vnfold the volume of thy wit, The chiefest solace of my mouing wit, CÃ¦des eo fuit nobilior, quia filius He reades. Patrem interfecit. Tacit. Hist. lib. 20. Auaunt thou damn'd wizard, did thy god Apollo teach thee to diuine my fall? What hath thy cursed Genius tract my steps Through the Meanders of darke Priuacie, And will he dwell with me in these close shades To vex my banisht soule, banisht from ioy, Remoued from the worlds eye? I am accurs'd, And hated by the Synode of the gods, A knot of enuious deceites, the day will be When they shall smart for this indignity. Enter solemne Musicke, the Ghost of Mahometes, Zemes, Trizham, Mahomet, Achmetes, Caiubus, Asmehemides, with each a sword and burning Tapers, led in by Nemesis, with a sword, they encompasse Bajazet in his bed. Nem. Triumph my Plantiffes, Nemesis your Queene Is Pierc'd quite through with your continuall groanes. See, see, the prostrate body of a King, Clad in the weedes of pining discontent, Lyeth open to your wrath, and dolefull hate: But I coniure you not to touch his skinne, Nor hurt his sacred person, those three Fates (Those frightfull sisters) told me they decree For Baiazet another destinie: But vex his soule with your deluding blowes, And let him dreame of direfull anguishments, Each in the proper order of his Fate, Vent the comprest confusion of his hate. One after another strike at Bajazet with their swords, Nemesis puts by their blowes. Exeunt in a solemne dance. Nemes. Awake, awake thou tortured Emperour, Looke with the eye of fury on the heauens, Threaten a downefall to this mortall stage, And let it cracke with thee, thy life is runne To the last Scene, thy Tragick part is done. Exit. Bajazet awakes in fury, ariseth. You meager deuils, and infernall hagges, Where are you? Ha? what vanisht? am I found? Did I not feele them teare and rack my flesh, And foreamble it amongst them? heauen and earth I am deluded, what thin ayrie shapes Durst fright my soule, I'le hunt about the world, Search the remotest angles of the earth, Till I'ue found out the climate hold these fiends, Or build a bridge by Geometrick skill, Whom lineall extension shall reach forth To the declining borders of the skie, On which I'le leade mortality along, And breake a passage through those brazen walls, From whence Ioue triumphs o're this lower world: Then hauing got beyond the vtmost sphere, Besiege the concaue of this vniuerse: And hunger-starue the gods till they confesse What furies did my sleeping soule oppresse. Ha? did it lighten? or what nimble flame Ha's crept into my blood? me thinkes it steales Through my distemper'd ioynts, as if it fear'd To vrge me to impatience. Hamon, accursed Hamon, stand my soule Aboue the power of these inuenom'd drugges: Am I in hell aliue? the Stygian flames Could not produce an heat so violent As burnes within my body: Oh I feele My heart drop into cindars, I am dust; Ioue for thine owne sake Ioue, confine my soule Within these wa'ls of earth: for in the skie VVhen I am there, none shall be Ioue but I. Still, still I boyle, and the continued flames Are aggrauated: He is done, subdu'd (By the base Art of a damn'd Emperick) VVhose empty name sent terrour through the world: Is not the heauen bespangl'd all with starres, And blazing Meteors, whose bright glimmering flames Like ceremoniall Tapers should adorne My solemne Hearse? what doth the golden Sunne Ride with it's wonted motion? are the waues Bridled within their narrow Continent No deluge? not an earthquake? Shall a Prince, An Emperour, a Baiazet decease And make no breach in nature? fright the world With no prodigeous birth? Are you asleepe You thundring beggards that so awe the world? I'le hasten to reuenge this strong neglect Of my deceasing spirits, mount my soule, Brush off this cloddy heauy element: So Ioue I come excorporate, diuine, Immortall as thy selfe, I must contest With thee proud god, with thee to arme my minde, Onely my soule ascends earth stayes behinde. Moritur. Enter the Ghosts as before him, and beare him out. Scena Decima. Enter Solyman as newly Crowned. Souldiers, Attendants, Warlike Musick. Solym. Is Selymus deceased? Sould. He is my Lord. Solym. Who Selymus? what Fate durst be so bold: Oh, I could act an holy frenzy now Selymus deceas'd? What did not Atlas tremble At such a burden? Can he support the Orbe That holds vp Selymus? is not yet the Pole Crackt with his weight? doe not the heauens preparr His funerall Exequies? Ioue I inuoke thee now, Command the heauens that the prone Chandler shops Command that idle PhÅbus, that he exhale Matter from earth to make thy Funerall Tapers: Or I'le make Torches of the vniuerse In stead of Comets; flaming Countries, Cities Shall be thy ceremoniall Tapers: Or if not this; I'le ransack Christendome, Kings Daughters I'le embowell for a Sacrifice, Their fat with vestall fire will I refine, And offer virgins ware vnto thy shrine. Start back bright PhÅbus, let thy firie Steedes Keepe Holiday for Selymus. tell thy host Proud Neptune now expects anothers deluge, That all the earth may weepe for Selymus. What doe you smile you Heauens? are ye conscious, And guilty of this execrable treason? What dare the fields to laugh when I doe mourne? I'le dye your motly colour'd weedes in scarlet, And cloath the world in black destruction. Nemesis, I'le naile thee to my greedy sword, Destruction shall serue vnder me a Prentiship. Courage braue Selmie, with thy Princely boat Through Styx euen all mortality shall float; I'le leauie Souldiers through the Vniuerse, With which thou shalt beguirt Elizeum; Thus barren Nature shall repent thy fall, Grieuing that shee did not the euent fore-stall; Death I will hate thee: the world shall weare Thy sable liuerie embroydered with feare: Thy Trophies euery where the world shall gaze on: Thy Armes in fable and in gules I blazon. Sould. My Lord this Crowne entreates you leaue off these Ground-creeping meditations, and to thinke Of Majestie, wherefore we inuest your browe With this rich robe of glory, and doe vowe To it our due alleageance: thus you shall Mount vp aloft aboue your Fathers fall. Solym. Thus our deare Father, those bright robes of state. For which so lately thou hast sweat in blood, Thou wearest vpon my shoulders in thy stead: Thus are we crown'd, and thus our labours bee, Made gainefull vnto thine, though not to thee. Sould. Liue then, and raigne most mighty Emperour, Whilst that our care and watchfull prouidence, Shall fence thy safety, and keepe Sentinell Ouer thy sacred person, were black treasons, Hatcht in the Center of the darkest earth, The massie element should be prospectiue For all our piercing eyes; should Pluto send His black Apparator to summon thee To appeare before him, by that Mahomet We would confront him boldly, and excuse Thy absence vnto Pluto, by our presence; Death we'le disarme thee, if thou dar'st arrest Thy fury on our Solyman, or we'le bale his person With our imprisonment. By our death thou shalt liue; our Citie walls May with warlike ruine be battered, But our allegeance, that European Bull, Shall neuer push from vs, with his golden hornes; Nor shall his guilded showers quench our loues: No golden Enginer shall vndermine The Castles of our faith, nor blow them vp VVith blasts of hop'd preferment, were thy walls But paper, were they made of brittle glasse, Our faiths should make them marble, and as firme As Adamant: not walls, but subiects loue, Doe to a Prince the strongest Castle proue. Behold great Prince alleageance mixt with loue Lock'd in our breasts: thou art the liuing key To shut, and to vnlock them at thy pleasure: No golden pick-lock shall e're scrue it selfe Into these faithfull locks, whose onely springs Can be no other then our owne heart strings, Our greedy swords which erst imbru'd in blood, Did seeme to blush at their owne Masters acts, And vpbraid vs with our bloody facts Though peace hath now condemn'd to pleasing rust, Yet at thy beck we'le sheath them in the breast Of daring Christians, thus in warre we'le fight For thee, whil'st thou dost striue for victory: Here to describe such Princely vertues, which Should more adorne thy Crowne then Orient pearles, Were but to shew a glasse, and to commend Thy selfe vnto thy selfe. Be gracious, Magnificent, couragious, or milde, Or more compendiously, be more thy selfe, Raigne then, and Mahomet grant that thou may'st passe Nestor in yeares, as much as now thou dost In wisedome and in valour; Herauld proclaime To the world his title, and let swift-winged Fame Second thy trumpet. Her. Long liue Solymon, &amp;c. Solym. We thanke you friendly Actors of our blisse, Our patience hath at length tired out the gods; Our Empire hath beene rackt enough with treasons, And black sedition, as if no Christians Were left to conquer, wee yeeld our Turkish blades Against our selues, imbowelling the State With bloudy discord, by our strength we fall A scorne to Christians, with our hands we shed That bloud which might haue conquered Christendome; Thus while we hate our selues we loue our enemies, And heale them with our sores, whil'st we lye weltring In bloudy peace: the dy of the publique safety Hath beene already cast by th'hand of warre, Treasons haue made a blot, which may prouoke The enemie to enter, and beare our men To darke Auernus, Enuie might haue blusht, Though alwayes pale at all our projects: now This bloudy deluge is quite past, returne Sweet Peace with th'Oliue branch, enough of warres, 'Tis thou must powre oyle into our scarres. Fly hence Hereditary hate, discords dead, Let not succeeding emnities and hatred liue. Let none presume to couer priuate sores With publique ruines, nor let black discord Make an Anatomie of our too leane Empire, let it wax fat againe; when peace Hath knit her knots, then shall the wanton sounds Of Bells giue place to thundring Bombardes, And blood wash out the smoothing oyle of Peace, Euery Souldier I'le ordaine a Priest To ring a fatall knell to Christians, And euery minute vnto earths wide wombe, Shall sacrifice a Christians Hecatombe: Then shall we make a league with Ãolus, The windes shall striue to further our proceedings, Then will we loade the Seas, and fetter Neptune With chaines that hold our Anchors; he shall quake Lest he to Pan resigne his watry Empire, And three fork'd mace vnto my awfull Scepter; The Whales and Dolphins shall amazed stand, That they shall yeeld their place to Beares and Lyons, Sylla shall howle for feare when she shall see The Sea become a Forrest, and her selfe Mountaine, then let Syrens quake For feare of Satyres, then let the Christians thinke, Not that our Nauie, but the Country it selfe Is come to moue them from the growing earth; Comets, fiery swords shall be my Heraulds, Threatning to th'world suddaine combustion: Let our armes be steely bowes, our arrowes Thunderbolts, and in stead of warlike Drummes, Thunder shall proclaime black destruction; Vulcan I'le tax thee, exercise thy Forge, Prepare to me for all the world a scourge, The Fates to me their powers shall resigne, Which with this hand will rend the strongest twine Of humane breath, first for the I'le of Rhodes Destruction there shall keepe his mournfull Stage: Th'inhabitants shall act a bloody Tragedy, And personate themselues; Then for Nayos Ile Death there shall keepe her Court, then I will make Vienna all a Shambles; yea gaping Famine Euer deuouring, alwayes wanting foode, Shall gnaw their bowels, and shall leaue them nothing Besides themselues to feede on; their dead corpes Shall be entombed in their neighbours bellies. There euery one shall be a lining Sepulcher, An vnhallowed Churchyard; famine shall feede it selfe, Then shall they enuie beasts, and wish to be Our Iades, our Mules, Matrons shall striue to bring Into the hatefull light abortiue Brats; The Infants shall returne, and the leane wombe Shall be vnto the Babes a suddaine tombe. Then shall they hoard carcasses, and striue Onely to be rich in Funerals; I'de reioyce To see them stand like Screech-Owles, gaping when Their Parents should expire, and bequeath To hell their wretched soules, to them their death. All. Long liue great Solymon our noble Emperour. Soly. All this, and more then this I'le doe, when peace Hath glutted our new greedy appetites, When it hath fill'd the veines of the Empire full With vigour, then lest too much blood should cause Armies of vices, not of men to kill vs, And strength breed weaknesse in our too great Empire, Then, then, and onely then we shall thinke good, With warre to let the body politick blood, Meane time we'le thinke on our Fathers Funerall: Oh, I could be an holy Epicure, In teares, and pleasing sighes, Oh I could now Refresh my selfe with sorrow, I could embalme Thy corpes with holy groanes from putrifaction: Oh, I could powder vp thy thirsty corpes With brinish teares, and wipe them off with kisses, And that I might more freely speake my griefe, These eyes should be still silent Orators, Till blindnesse shut them vp were I a woman: But I am Solyman, Emperour, the Turke, Blood shall be my teares, I'le thinke thee slaine Amongst the Christians, and translate my griefe To fury, euery member of my body Shall execute the office of a weeping sonne. Thus in my teares an Argus will I bee, My head, heart, hands, and all shall weepe for thee. Oh, that the cruell Fates were halfe so milde As to driue streames of teares from forth the springs, Great sorrowes haue no leasure to complaine, Least ills vent forth, great griefes within remaine: See Selymus, sometimes a fore-string instrument Feeding his Souldiers with sweet Harmony, Doth now tune nought to vs but Lacrymy, Could n' Ãsculapius be found to tune His disagreeing elements treasons crackt The string which else an headach would vntune. Euery disease is a ragged fort To weare these strings asunder, treason did lend Death, which both age, and sicknesse did intend; What then remaines, but that his Funerall rites With our Grandfather, Vncles be solemnized, That so black discord may be with them buried: But noble Selymus what Tombe shall I prepare For thy memoriall? shall a heauy stone Presse thy innocent ashes? Shall I confine Thy wandring ghost in some high marble prison? Or shall I hither fetch the flying Tombe Of proud Mausolus the rich Carian King? No; Religion shall cloake no such iniurie, No hired Rhethorick shall adorne thy coarse, No pratling stone shall trumpet forth thy praise, The world's thy tombe, thy Epitaph I'le carue In Funerals, destruction is the booke In which we'le write thy annalls, blood's the Inke, Our sword the Pen; A Tragedy I intend, Which with a Plangity, no Plaudity shall end.
