      <field name="fulltext">TO THE HONORABLE AND HIS VERY DEARE FRIENDS SIR William Herbert, AND SIR William Pope KNIGHTS, ASSOCIATES IN THE NOBLE ORDER OF THE BATHE. BARNABE BARNES CONSECRATETH HIS LOVE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGVS. Gracious spectators doe not heere expect, Visions of pleasure, amorous discourse: Our subiect is of bloud and Tragedie, Murther, foule Incest, and Hypocrisie. Behold the Strumpet of proud Babylon, Her Cup with fornication foaming full Of Gods high wrath and vengeance for that euill, Which was imposd vpon her by the Diuill. Francis Guicchiardine. Sent from the Christall Palace of true Fame, And bright Starre-Chamber of eternall soules, Seuerd from Angels fellowship awhile, To dwell with mortall bodies here on earth: I Francis Guicciardine a Florentine, Am by the powerfull and commanding Muse, (Which beareth domination in our soules) Sent downe to let you see the Tragedie, Of Roderigo Borgia lately Pope, Calld the sixt Alexander, with his sonne Proud Cæsar: to present vnto your eyes, Their faithlesse, fearelesse, and ambitious liues: And first by what vngodly meanes and Art, Hee did attaine the Triple-Diadem, This vision offerd to your eyes declares. Hee with a siluer rod mooueth the ayre three times. Enter, At one doore betwixt two other Cardinals, Roderigo in his purple habit close in conference with them, one of which hee guideth to a Tent, where a Table is furnished with diuers bagges of money, which that Cardinall beareth away: and to another Tent the other Cardinall, where hee deliuereth him a great quantity of rich Plate, imbraces, with ioyning of hands. Exeunt Card. Manet Roderigo To whome from an other place a Moncke with a magical booke and all, in priuate whispering with Roderick, whome the Monke draweth to a chaire on midst of the Stage which hee circleth, and before it another Circle, into which (after semblance of reading with exorcismes) appeare exhalations of lightning and sulphurous smoke in midst whereof a diuil in most vgly shape: from which Roderigo turneth his face, hee beeing coniured downe after more thunder and fire, ascends another diuill like a Sargeant with a mace vnder his girdle: Roderigo disliketh. Hee discendeth: after more thunder and fearefull fire, ascend in robes pontificall with a triple Crowne on his head, and Crosse keyes in his hand: a diuill him ensuing in blacke robes-like a pronotary, a cornerd Cappe on his head, a box of Lancets at his girdle, a little peece of fine parchment in his hand, who beeing brought vnto Alexander, hee willingly receiueth him; to whome hee deliuereth the wryting, which seeming to reade, presently the Pronotary strippeth vp Alexanders sleeue and letteth his arme bloud in a saucer, and hauing taken a peece from the Pronotary, subscribeth to the parchment; deliuereth it: the remainder of the bloud, the other diuill seemeth to suppe vp; and from him disroabed is put the rich Cap the Tunicle, and the triple Crowne set vpon Alexanders head, the Crosse-keyes deliuered into his hands; and withall a magicall booke: this donne with thunder and lightning the diuills descend: Alexander aduanceth himselfe, and departeth. Guicchiardine. Thus first with golden bribes he did corrupt The purple conclaue: then by diuelish art Sathan transfigur'd like a Pronotarie To him makes offer of the triple Crowne For certaine yeares agreed betwixt them two. The life of action shall expresse the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS. 1. SCÆN. 1. Enter marching after drummes &amp; trumpets at two seuerall places, King Charles of France, Gilbert Mompanseir, Cardinall of Saint Peter ad Vincula: soldiers: encountring them Lodowik Sforza, Charles Balbiano, the King of France and Lodowike embrace. Char. Renouned Lodowik our warlike Couzen, Auspiciously encountred on the skirtes Of Piedmont, we greete you ioyfully. Lodo. Thrise and foreuer most renowned Charles, A faithfull tongue from an vnfained heart As a iust herrold full of truth and honor On the behalfe of forlorne Italie Needing and crauing at your Princely hands, The patronage and true protection Of such a Potent and victorious King Humbly salutes your royall Maiesty. The shippe of which some-time well guided state, Is through tempestious times malignity By worthlesse Pilots, foolish Gouerners Mutually factious, like to sinck through Schisme. Into the bottome of the blacke abisme Through th'imposition of necessity. Do not! oh do not then (most Christian Charles) Do not forsake hir holding vp hir hands For succor to your royall Clemency: Hir sayles are rent, mastes spent and rudder brooke And vnder water such wide open leakes As vnder water soone will make her sinke. Hauing beene bilg'd vpon so many shelues, So torne, so rotten and so long vnrig'd, And playing with the waues to and againe As one not gouerned with helpe of helme. One then whome nature in his vowes to God, Hath tied to tender her forlone estate With eyes fore-seeing and compassionate. Retenders her to your high Maiestie, A Christian Prince so wise so valiant: Vndoubted heire vnto the Crowne of Naples, By lawfull right of that greate house of Aniou: Of which your grace is well knowne lawfull heire, By th'issues of that Charles the first, that first Of the bloud royall of the Crowne of France, Obtain'd that Kingdome ages manie past. These reasons weare with Lodowik Sforza mou'd, To moue your Maiesty with martiall force To passe these mountaines to possesse your owne. March then most Christian and renowned Prince, Aduance thy lilly standard potent King: And since all skandalls are remou'd and cleer'd, Strike vp your cheerefull drummes and march along In Gods name; with good auspices of Saint Denys, I know you doubt not mine integrity: Can more grosse error rest in pollicy. Then first to raise a turbulent sharpe storme, And vnaduisedly to leaue defence To doubtfull chance and possibilities. To broach strong poyson is too dangerous, And not be certeine of the present vertue Which is contained in his Antidot. Wilde fire permitted without limmit burnes, Euen to consume them that first kindled it: I did aduise you, I inducted you, And Lodowike, which brought you on with honor, Will bring you of with triumph and renowne. Char. Embrace me Couzen Sforza: by the soules Of my forefathers I reioyce as much In thy deare friendship and wise industrie, As in the more parteof my patrimonie: Courage togither let vs share all one, In life, in death, in purchase or in none. Enter a Messenger with letters to Charles. These newes are fortunate for Daubigny, Aduertiseth how that the Coloneses, (Although Alfonso did accord with them,) Declared haue them-selues for France and vs, Without dissembling or hypocrisie. Lodo. Why this was it I did expect great Charles, Our armies and our friends haue beene long sowne, The ground well plowed, the blade is full come vp, And doubt not we shall haue a ioyfull haruest. Char. Coosen Montpansier March with your regiments to Pontremolt. Expect vs, or from vs directions, To meete our forces, when wee come neere Florence, There shall you finde the Swisse with their Artillerie, Newly by sea brought vnto Spetia, Come Coosen march we cheerefully together, Faire is the way, faire fortune, and faire wether, Mompansier with some souldiers and Ensignes before. King Charles with Lodowike and his soldiers after. SCENA. 2. Enter 2. Gentlemen with Libels in their hands. 1. Gent. Nay such prophane and monstrous Sodomie, Such obscure Incest and Adultery, Such odious Auarice and perfidie, Such vinolence and brutish gluttony, So barren of sincere integritie. 2. Gent. In whom there is no shame nor veritie, Faith nor religion, but meere cruelty? Immoderate ambition, guilfull treacherie, Such prophanation and Apostacie, And in all falsehood such dexteritie. 1. Gent. As heauens detest, and men on earth distaste. 2. Gent. Such impious sacriledge, such adulation: 1. Gent. Of all good men such detestation. 2. Gent. Such Magick skill, such diuilish incantation. 1. Gent. Apparant figures of damn'd reprobation. 2. Gent. As in all thoughts is thought abhomination. 1. Gent. Time will out-strip vs; for the morning starre, Portends the mounting of faire Phœbus Carre. 2. Gent. Hast we, for danger drawne on by delay, Admits no time to tarry till cleere day. 1. Gent. Fix on your Papers, these for Alexander And his ambitious Cæsar: set on yours. Hale reuerent I'asquill Idoll of veritie, As hee fixeth on his papers. Accept these sacrifices which we bring. 2. Gent. These be sinne offrings figuring foule vice. Oh glorious guider of the golden Spheres, And thou that from thy pretious lyricke strings Makes Gods and men in heauen and earth to dance With sacred touch of sweetest harmony: Pitty these times, by whose malignitie, We loose our grace, and thou thy dignity. 1. Gent. High Muse, which whilome vertues patronized, In whose eternall rowles of memory The famous acts of Princes were comprized By force of euer-liuing Historie: What shall wee doe to call thee backe againe? True Chronicler of all immortall glory, When here with mortall men nought is deuis'd, But how all stories with foule vice to staine: So that alas thy gratious Oratorie, Which with meere truth and vertue simpathiz'd, Is silent; and wee Poets now with paine, (Which in Castalian Fountaines dip'd our quilles) Are forc'd of mens impietie to plaine; And well thou wotest, wrought against our wills, In rugged verse, vile matters to containe: And herein lurkes the worst of mortall ills, That Rome (which should be Vertues Paradice) Bare of all good, is wildernesse of vice. 2. Gent. How luculent and more conspicuous Euen then the sunne, in cleerest Maiestie, His vehement and more then hellish thirst Soaring to pearch vpon the spire of honour Displaies his bastard wings: and in that nest Where princely Fawlcons, or Ioues kingly Birds, Should hatch their young ones, plants his rauenous Harpies, His gracelesse, impious, and disastrous sonnes, Euen in the soueraigne Chaire of domination. 1. Gent. But chiefly one, that diuelish Cardinall, Proud Cæsar, farst, with fierce impietie: His Oracle and instrument of shame In all nefarious plotts and practises, Is now become as wicked as himselfe: But hast we now, least any should suspect vs. 2. Gent. Much conference with Pasquill may detect vs. Exeunt. SCÆNA. 3. Enter Gismond di Visselli, and after him Barbarossa. Bar. Dio viguarda Signior illustrissimo: whether in such hast my noble Lord thus early? Gis. Signior Barbarossa in happy time well encountred, for I haue some businesse this morning with my brother the Duke of Candie, wherein I would both vse your counsell and countenance. Bar. My good Lord Viselli, the countenance of your deuoted poore friend, is of lesse value then his counsell, yet both of very small validity: such as they be, with his life and best fortunes he sincerely sacrificeth all to your seruice. Gis. Pardon mee deere sir no seruice more then reciprocall, and in due paritie betwixt vs, and since wee be so neere it, let vs not passe Pasquill without an Aue: what scandalous hyerogliphickes haue wee heere? A. S. P. M. Auaritia, Superbia, Perfidia, Malitia, Alexander, Sextus, Pontifex, Maximus. Against my Lord the Popes holinesse such blasphemous impudence, such intollerable bitternesse! M. P. S. A. These are the same letters with the first beginning at the last, Magnum Petrum Sequitur Antichristus, Phy Diabolo, our blessed Alexander (beeing Saint Peeters successor) this diuilish libeller calls Antichrist. Bar. Pause there my Lord a litle, some-what here concernes my Lord the Cardinall Borgia. Gis. Read it good Barbarossa. Bar. Alexander Cæsarem suum Galero et purpura donauit vt menstruoso spiritus sui veneno, vniuersum simul conclaue suffocaret. Gis. Oh most intollerable abhomination? Bar. Alexander adopted his sonne Cæsar into the fellowship of Cardinalls, that he with the menstruous poyson of his breath might choake the whole Conclaue. Gis. By the blessed alter of Saint Peeter this villanie surpasseth patience. Bar. My Lord here's a long libell. Gis. Read it good Barbarossa: more mischeife of my wife nay read it. Bar. Quid mirum? Romæ facta est Lucretia Thais, Vnica Alexandri filia, sponsa nurus. The same in effect inseueth. Welcome good Post from Rome tell vs some newes, Lucrece is turned Thayis of the stewes: In whome her father Alexander saw, His onely daughter, wife, and daughter in law, Shall I read on my Lord? here is much more. Gis. Nay read out all, it is but of a whore. Bar. Francesco di Gonsaga was the first, That married Lucrece Alexanders daughter, And yet the Pope those bains of bridale burst, And made of marriage sacrament a laughter, His reason was because that fellow poore, Lackt maintenance for such a noble whore. Gis. Malignant aspect of vngratious stars, Why haue you poynted at my miseries? Bar. Haue patience good my Lord and here the rest, Gis. Patienza per forza, but this wounds to th'quick. Bar. Iohn Sforza now Lord Marques of Pescare, Was second husband to this ioly dame, Of natures faculties he being bare, In like state with his predecessor came, Because he, when he should haue writ his mind, Paper well might; but pen or incke none finde. Gis. Oh villainies of monstrous people, Fashions and times deformed and vnseasonable, Bar. Yet my Lord a little haue patience in your owne cause. Gis. Mallice performe thy worst least comming late, I with anticipation crosse that fate. Read it, toot man. Bar. Gismond Viselli, nobly descended, Is for his shamefull match much discommended. For neuer was the shamelesse Fuluia, Nor Lais noted for so many wooers, Nor that vnchast profuse Sempronia. A common dealer with so many dooers, So proud, so faithlesse, and so voyd of shame, As is new brodell bride Lucretia, Take to thee Gismond both the skorne and shame, And liue long iealous of Lucretia. With pushing hornes keepe out all commers in, For now thy mortall miseries begin. Gis. Mortall miseries? but we are all mortall, Fortune I scorne thy malice, and thy meed, Keepe them vp safe that I may shew them to his holines, Is this the licence which our citty Rome Hath giuen to beastly Bardes, and satyrists, Ribbaldly Rimesters, and malicious curs, To leaue no state of Church nor seculer, Free from their ordure, and polution. Good Barbarossa beare me Company: Exile and Punishment for such base poets, And stripes with wiery scourges were too litle. Which breathing here in Rome, and taking grace: From the faire Sunne-shine of this hemisphere, Contaminate that ayre with their vile breath, Obumbrating this light by which they liue, If these were truth: this times impietie, May soone sincke downe vnder the diety. Exeunt. SCÆN. 4. Alexander in his study with bookes, coffers, his triple Crowne vpon a cushion before him. Alex. With what expence of money plate and iewels This Miter is attayn'd my Coffers witnesse: But Astaroth my couenant with thee Made for this soule more pretious then all treasure, Afflicts my conscience, O but Alexander Thy conscience is no conscience; if a conscience, It is a leoprouse and poluted conscience. But what? a coward for thy conscience? The diuill is witnesse with me when I seald it And cauteriz'd this conscience now seard vp To banish out faith, hope and charity; Vsing the name of Christian as a stale For Arcane plots and intricate designes That all my misty machinations And Counsels held with black Tartarian fiends Were for the glorious sunne-shine of my sonnes; That they might mounte in equall paralel With golden maiesty like Saturnes sonne To darte downe fire and thunder on their foes. That, that was it, which I so much desir'd To see my sonnes through all the world admir'd, In spight of grace, conscience, and Acharon I will reioyce, and triumph in my Charter. Alexander readeth. Sedebis Roma Papa, summa in fælicitate tui et Filiorum anne; 11. et 7. dies 8. post moriere. Prouiso quod nunquam te signes tremendæ Crucis signo. Astaroth. The diuill prouideth in his couenant I should not crosse my selfe at any time; I neuer was so ceremonious. Well this rich Miter thought it cost me deare Shall make me liue in pompe whilst I liue heere. Holla Bernardo? He tincketh a bell. Call hether my two sonnes the Duke of Candy and the Cardinall of Valence. Happie those sonnes whom fathers loue so well That for their sakes they dare aduenture hell. Enter the Duke of Candy and Cæsar Borgia striuing for priority. Come my deare sonnes the comfort of my life Yours is this earthly glory which I hold. Cannot the spacious boundes of Italy Diuided equally containe you both? From France and Swisserland I will beginne With Naples and those Townes in Peadmont And all the signories in Lombardy From Porto di Volane to Sauona And Genes on th'other side of Italy Vpon the Mediterranean towards Greece; Allotted Candy for his patrimony. And in Romania from Pontremoli And Prato to faire Florence; and from thence In Tuskany within the Riuer Narre And fruitfull Arno those sweete Prouinces Euen to Mont Alto, Naples, Policastro And Petrasilia in Calabria The furthest home of Italy for Cæsar. Gaine dubble strength with your vnited loues Loue one another boies you shal be Kings: Fortune hath beene auspicious at my birth And will continue gratious to mine end. Castor and Pollux would not liue in Heauen Vnlesses they might be stellified togither, You for a little-turfe of earth contend When they togither shine the welkin cleeres: And gentle gales beare fourth the winged sailes, But when they shine a parte they threaten stormes And hiddeous tempests to the Marriners Castor would not be called but Pollux Castor And Castor Castors Pollux: so my Candy Be Cæsars Candy, Cæsar, Candies Cæsar, With perfect loue, deare boyes loue one another So either shal be strengthened by his brother. Cæ. Most blessed reuerend and renowned father, The loue by nature to my brother Candy, Enforceth me some-times in plainer sort To cleere my conscience issuing from pure loue, It is meere loue which mooues these passions, When I do counsell or aduise your good. Ca. I know deere brother when your counsell tends Vnto my good it issueth from pure loue. Cæ. As when I tax your princely conscience Like an vnpitted penetentiarie, Brother with reuerence of his Holinesse Your heart is too much spic'd with honesty. Alex. I and I feare me he will find it so, Your brother Cæsar tells you very true: You must not be so ceremonious Of oathes and honesty, Princes of this world Are not prickt in the bookes of conscience, You may not breake your promise for a world: Learne this one lesson looke yee marke it well, It is not alwaies needfull to keepe promise, For Princes (forc'd by meere necessity To passe their faithfull promisses) againe Forc'd by the same necessity to breake promise. Cæ. And for your more instructi?s learne these rules! If any Cedar, in your forrest spread, And ouer-peere your branches with his top, Prouide an axe to cut him at the roote, Suborne informers or by snares intrap That King of Flies within the Spiders Webbe; Or els insnare him in the Lions toyles. What though the multitude applaud his fame: Because the vulgar haue wide open eares Mutter amongst them and possesse their hearts That his designements wrought against the state By which yea wound him with a publicke hate. So let him perish, yet seeme pittifull Cherrish the weakenesse of his stocke and race As if alone he meritted disgrace. Suffer your Court to mourne his funeralls, But burne a bone-fire for him in your Chamber. Alex. Cæsar deliuereth Oracles of truth. Tis well sayd Cæsar, yet attend a little, And binde them like rich bracelets on thine armes Or as a precious iewell at thine care. Suppose two factious Princes both thy friends; Ambitious both, and both competitors, Aduance in hostile armes against each other Ioyne with the strongest to confound the weake But let your wars foundation touch his Crowne, Your neerest Charity concernes your selfe; Els let him perish; yet seeme charitable. As if you were meerely compos'd of vertue: Beleeue me Candy things are as they seeme, Not what they be themselues; all is opinion: And all this world is but opinion. Looke what large distance is twixt Heauen and Earth, So many leagues twixt wealth and honesty: And they that liue puling vpon the fruits Of honest consciences; starue on the Common. Cæsar can tell thee this in ample sorte. And Cæsar loue him, loue him hartily; Though mildenesse do possesse thy brother Candie, It is a gentle vice, vicining vertue. Can. Vnder correction of your Holinesse, Those warres which vertue leuies against vice, Are onely knowne to some particulers Which haue them wrytten in their consciences. Those are the same they seeme and in such warres Your sonne shall make remonstrance of his valour, And so become true Champion of the Church. Cæs. It is the precious Ornament of Princes To be strong hearted, proud, and valiant, But well attempted with callidity, Brother with reuerence of his holinesse (Whose sacred words like blessed Oracles Haue pointed at your prudence) Cæsar would Haue giuen the like aduise: but (in conclusion) Vndoubtedly to worke out thy confusion. Enter Barnardo. Ale. Vpon my blessing follow Cæsars counsell; It tendeth to thy glory. Bern. Most blessed Lord, Embassadors from Ferdinande of Naples Arriued heere attend your holinesse. Ale. This is a welcome messenger for Godfrey, To make a marriage with the Lady Saunce: And Candy for so much as this requires A ioyfu'l entertainment; take that honor And bid him welcome with due complements. Shew courteous, language laudable apporte; Let them be feasted in more sumpteous sort Then ordinary messengers of state: Obserue his speeches, fathome his designes; And for I know thy nature tractable, And full of courtesie: shew courtesie And good intreatie to them: Gentle Candie Now shew thy selfe a polititian; I neede not giue thee large instructions; For that I know thee wise, and honorable Greete them from vs: Cæsar shall at a turne Giue correspondence to thy courtesie: I as well sitteth with my state and honor Within these ten daies wil admit them hearing: Meane while learne out by lore of policie The substance of their motions, that we may Be better arm'd to giue them resolution. Can. Your holinesse in this shall see my skill, To do you seruice, Exit Candy. Alex. Cæsar now to thee. This taske vpon thy shoulders onely leanes; I rest vpon thee Cæsar: were it not That thou must second it, or first it rather I durst not trust such things of consequence, To feeble spirits: therefore from our stables Six Persian Coursers arm'd and furnished With rich Caparisons of gold and Pearle, With six rich Complet Armots for their saddles, And such a Cabbinet of pretious Iewels As we shall choose within to morrow morning Present from vs in token of our loue. Let for no cost in sumptuous banqueting, Beleeue me Cæsar some-times at a banquet, More ground is got then at a bloudy battell. Worme out their humors, fathom their delights, If they delight in that which Naples couets, Fine, witty, loue-sick, braue, and beautifull, Eloquent, glancing, full of fantasies. Such Sugar harted Syrens, or such Commets, As shine in our imperiall state of Rome, True pick-locks in close wards of policie, Present them with the Paragons of Rome: And spare not for a Million in expence, So long as here they keepe their residence. Cæsar. Cæsar in such a case will prooe true Cæsar, Wise, franke, and honorable. Alex. I doubt it not: And Cæsar, (as thou doost imbrace my loue, More then the world besides) accomplish this, And wee shall Cæsar with high blessings blisse, Exit. Cæs. By this time is my faire Lucretia, Befitted for a businesse of bloud, Neerely concerning her estate and mine. Exit. SCÆ. 5. Enter Lucretia alone in her night gowne vntired, bringing in a chaire, which she planteth vpon the Stage. Luc. Lucretia cast off all seruile feare, Reuenge thy selfe vpon thy iealous husband That hath be raid thine honor, wrong'd thy bed: Feare not; with resolution act his death: Let none of Borgias race in policies Exceed thee Lucrece: now proue Cæsars Sister, So deepe in bloudy stratagems as hee: All sinnes haue found examples in all times. If womanly thou melt then call to minde, Impatient Medeas wrathfull furie, And raging Clitemnestraes hideous fact: Prognes strange murther of her onely sonne, And Danaus fifty Daughters (all but one) That in one night, their husbands sleeping slew. My cause as iust as theirs, my heart as resolute, My hands as ready. Gismond I come, Haild on with furie to reuenge these wrongs And loue impoison'd with thy iealousie, I haue deuised such a curious snare, As iealious Vulcan neuer yet deuis'd, To graspe his armes vnable to resist, Deaths instruments inclosed in these hands. Shee kneeleth downe. You griefly Daughters of grimme Erebus, Which spit out vengeance from your viperous heires, Infuse a three-fold vigor in these armes; I marble more my strong indurate heart, To consumate the plot of my reuenge. Shee riseth and walketh passionately. Enter Gismond di Viselli vntrussed in his Night-cap, tying his points. Heere comes the subiect of my Tragedy. Gis. What my Lucretia walking alone? These solitarie passions should bewray Some discontentment, and those gracious eyes Seeme to be moon'd with anger, not with loue: Tell me Lucretia, may thy Gismond know? Luc. Demaundst thou the cause iniurious Gismond? When like a recluse (shut vp from the world) I liue close prisoner to thy iealousie? The'Esperian Dragons kept not with more watch, The golden fruit then thou my fatall beauty: Thou wouldst exclude me from the sight of Sunne, But that his beames breake through some creuisies Thou wouldst debarre me from the common ayre, But that against my will I suck it in, And breath it out in scalding sighes againe: Were I in Naxos where no noise is heard But Neptunes rage, no sights but ruthelesse rocks. Or in the Libian deserts or exchang'd This Hemisphere of Rome forth' Antipodes, Were not so grieuous as to dwell in Rome, Banish'd from sight and conference of friends. Gis. Banist thou my iealousie? nay blame thy beauty, And loue imprison'd in those amorous lookes: I feare the Sunnes reflections on thy face, Least he more wondring at thy precious eyes, Then any Nimphes which he most honored, Should beare thee to some other Paradice, And rob me, silly man, of this worlds ioy. I feare the windes least amorous Ioue in them, (Enuying such pretious nature amongst men) With extreame passion hence should hurry thee. Oh loue is full of feare all things I feare, By which I might be frustrate of thy loue. Luc. Scoffst thou mee Gismond with continuall taunts? Oh God of heauens, shall I both suffer shame And scorne, with such dispisd captiuitie. Gis. Here in the presence of the powers in Heauen, I doe not speake in scorne, but in meere loue: And further Lucrese, (of thy clemencie, For loue, and beautie, both are riche in bountie) Forgiue me what is past, and I will sweate, Neuer to vex thee with more iealousie. Luc. Thou wilt forsweare thy selfe: Gismond come hither? Sit downe and answer me this question. Gismond sitteth downe in a Chaire, Lucretia on a stoole beside him. When I bestowed on thee this diamond A Iewell once held precious as my life; And with it cast away my selfe on thee Didst thou not promise to maintaine mine honour, Neither in word nor deed to giue suspect Of thy dislike; and hast thou not since then In presence of my neerest Noble friends Rebuk'd me like a Layis for my lightnesse? And as a miser lockes his mony vp So me restraind from speech and sight of them? Gis. When first thou didst bestow this Diamond, It had a precious lustre in mine eye: And was possest of vertue, when I vow'd To maintaine that, which was impossible: But since that time this stone hath had a slaw, Broken within the ring, his foile growne dimme, The vertue vanisht, and the luster lost. She graspeth him in his chaire. Luc. I can no longer brooke these base rebukes. These taunting riddles and close libellings Gis. Oh helpe I am strangled. She stoppeth his mouth, pulleth out his dagger and offereth to gagge him. Lu. Peace wretched villaine, then reciue this quickly: Or by the liuing powers of heauen ile kill thee. She gaggeth him, and taketh a pape out of her boosome. Take pen and incke: tis not to make thy will; For if thou wilt subscribe, I will not kill. Tis but to cleere those scandalls of my shame, With which thy iealousie did me defame. Gismonde subscribeth. So now that part is playd, what followes now? Thou Ribbauld, Cuckcold, Rascall, Libeller, Pernicious Lecher voide of all performance; Periurious Coxcombe, Foole, now for those wrongs Which no great spirit could well tollerate Come I, with mortall vengeance on thy soule. Take this for sclandring of his Holinesse My blessed father and my brother Cæsar She stabbeth With incest: this take for my brother Candy: And this for Noble Sphorza whom thou wrongest; And since the time is shorte I will be shorte: For locking vp of me, calling me whore, Setting espialls tending at my taile; Take this, and this &amp; this to make amends. three stabs togither. And put thee from thy paines; She vnbindeth him, layeth him on the grownd, putteth the dagger in his hand, a paper on his knee, &amp; taking certaine papers out of his pocket putteth in others in their steede: &amp; c?uaieth away the chaire Now will my father Alexander say That I did take the best and safest way, And Cæsar will approue it with his heart, That Lucrece hath perform'd a cunning parte. If others aske who Gismonde kild or why It was himselfe repenting iealousie. Exit Lucretia. Barbarossa knocketh at a dore. Bar. Holla within there? Why fellowes? Seruingman. Heere my Lord. Bar. What is my Lord Uiselli stirring yet? My Lord the Pope expects him and the ambassadors Of Naples craue his company. Enter Bar. and Seruingman. Ser. My Lord I haue not seene him yet this morning. Bar. Is not your Lady Lucrce stirring yet? Ser. No my good Lord I thinke shee be not yet come from her chamber, her custome is not to be seene so soone. Bar. Tis well, tis wel, let her take ease in gods name, But make hast, call vp my Lord thy maister honest fellow. Ser. With patience of your Lordship I will speake: For three daies space I did finde in my Lord Passionate motions, and strange melancholie 'T may be his solitude hath drawne him forth, I will first looke the garden and the galleries. Bar. Do my good friend I will expect thee in this parler here? As Barbarossa goes on hee findeth Viselli murthered vpon the ground, and starteth. Fellow come backe, come back, fellow come back: Your Lord lies murthred here call vp your Lady; Call in your fellow seruants. Deh Santa Croce. This dagger grasped in his fatall hand Reueales some violence, wrought on himselfe: Could nature so much violate her selfe? Was it not wrought by bloudy Borgines race? I doubt in this the diuills hypochrisie, Iustice of Heauens firme and inscrutable Reueale it, oh reueale it in thy mercy. Enter Lucrecia with Moticilla. Luc. Where is my Lord? my deare Lord? Bar. Tarry Lady. Approch not neere this ruthfull spectacle; Approch not neere this spectacle of bloud, This ruthfull spectacle of bloud and death, Least suddaine horror of these bleeding wounds Wound thy distracted spirits to pale death. Luc. What horror or what mortall spectacle. Vpon such suddaine hath astonished me? Oh my deere Lord: Viselly speake to me: Oh most disastrous accident and houre; Ay me most wretched and vnfortunate, My deerest Lord the treasure of my life, The sweetest paradice of my best hopes, Is murthred: seeke out the murtherers Leaue not vnseartcht a corner nor a Crany: Locke vp the dores there least that homicide Escape vs in this passion— Bar. Haue patience Lady Heauens will reueale the murther doubt it not. Luc. Ah Noble Barbarossa much I feare Now with these eyes I see the murtherer, Staind with the guilt of nature; oh my Lord You little know that these weake womans hands Twise rescued haue the violence of his From killing of himselfe before this time: Oh fie vpon the diuill, and melancholy; Which leaue me desolate a forelorne widdow. Mot. Madam these papers will bewray some matter. Luc. Oh might I finde an other murtherer. Bar. These do containe some matter read them Lady. Luc. My heart swolne vp with sorrow, lends no light Vnto mine eyes nor force vnto my tongue To see one letter, or to reade one word, I pray you reade it good Lord Barbarossa. Barbarossa readeth. I Gismond di Viselli through desperate griefe conceiued in iealousie (which I bare against my Lady Lucrecia) hauing found out by much triall, and examination her faithfulnesse and innocency, make this my protestation as the last piacular oblation to her for those wrongs that with mine own vnfortunate hands I haue ended my life, desiring her and all others to forgiue me, and pray for me, subscribed with mine owne hand, and sealed with my seale. Gismond de Viselli. Il veleuo d'amore, A me trafisse il cuore. Mot. Oh Lord of heauens haue pardon on his soule. Luc. This is his hand and seale, speake now my Lord: Did not I soone disclose the murtherer? Told I not that the murtherer was present? Ah neuer neuer shall I liue to see. she soundeth. Bar. Comfort you selfe deere Lady God will send succor Your husband hath paied deerely for these wrongs. Luc. Giue me my Lord againe, death shall not haue him, Come my deere Gismond, come againe my ioye: Delay me not least I preuent thy loue I cannot brooke delay's, Lucrece shall follow. Lucrece offereth to stab her selfe Barbarossa preuenteth her. Bar. Tempt not Gods iustice Lady, fall to praier, Helpe, in the take your Lord out of her sight. Luc. Oh my deare friends that see my miseries, I you beseech in dearest tendernesse Bring in the body of my dearest Lord; That I before my death may (with these eyes) Behold him honor'd in his obsequies. Bar. And I wil beare these papers to his Holines, Whose sorrow wil exceed for Gismonds death. Exeunt. Enter Guicchiardin. Cho. Thus soule suspition, feare and iealousie Of shame, dishonor, and his wiues hot lust, Hath seaz'd vpon Viselli; whose reuenge, Was to restraine Lucrece from Company- But swelling pride, and lust, both limitles, Answer'd his louing feare and shame with death. Attend the sequell. Now successiuely (After such warlike preparations, So many firme hopes found in Italy) King Charles with fifteene hundred men at armes, Three thousand Archers, with six thousand Swisse. French men, and Gascons twise as many more, With martiall measures, ouer Piemont Treads a long march after his drums and fife, With Milans force, and now his trumpets hard, Vnto the gates of Rome giue fresh allarms, Vnto the Pope, who stirreth vp in armes,</field>

In filiall Loue I thanke your Holines, We litle thought it our most holy father, That our alegeance to the Church of Rome, Which we with all our predecessors tendred, Should haue enforc'd you to take sanctuary. Alex. Sonne Charles know then we tooke not to this place, In feare as to some refuge or asyle: But for asmuch as news were brought in post, That you with all your forces did approch. Arm'd and in hostile manner to this Citty, The Conclaue thought it fit tendring the safty, Of holy Church, and sacred priuiledge, To know your meaning first, and then with pomp, To make your welcome in Saint Peters pallace, In the best fashion with due ceremonies. Char. Know then most holy father what we would, Hauing in tedious marcht from France thus far, Past with our forces God stil guiding vs, (As we be deepely bound by lawes of nature. And reason to worke surely for our right) We left noe busie doubts, nor obstacles, Which might preuent vs in our iust imprease, Hence was it that we did Capitulate, So strictly with the crafty Florentines, Whome we well knew fauour'd Alphonsoes part.

So may we put in hazard our whole Church The deere estate of Christes flock militant And bring confusion vnto Christendome. Alex. So may you seaze vpon the Churches rights, If that we should referre all to your trust. Can. This is Saint Peters bul-warke; for my parte Here I will die ere I surrender it. Cha. Now find I true which c?mon bruite proclameth Of your bad meanings and hypochrisie: But I referre your conscience to that Iudge Whom (if my conscience harber any thought To wrong the Church of God, in any thing) I call in iustice to reuenge on me.

Your faith &amp; honor? stay most Christian Charles Men will not yeeld vp Castels vpon wordes Vnles their states, and liues grow desperate. Mount. Why make we longer parlee with this Pope Whose false-hood is so much that neither oth, Nor honesty can purchase place with him. Lodo. Who neuer yet in cause of consequence Hath kept his promise. Char. Tell vs, will yee graunt? Alex. What should we graunt most Christian King of France And tell me truly (were it your owne case) Whether you would (on such slight promises) Accord to such vneuen conditions? Char.

Victorious Charles, such is my trust and loue That neither feare of force nor violence Could any wayes induce me to suspect you. Hence came it that the portes of Rome were opened (At our behests) to giue you guestning. Accept vs therefore with our promises, Which we shall vnder hand and seale confirme Not any way to Crosse your action. Char. If you will yeeld vp Castell Angelo Resolue vs presently without delaies? Cæs. Because it is Saint Peeters Cittadell The conclaue is in doubt to make surrender. Char. You will not yeeld then? Can. We cannot, nor wee will not yeeld it vp. Char. Why then a parle with our ordinance. Sound drummes and trumpets: Alexander with his companie of the walles, ordinance goeing of (after a little skirmish within) hee summons from the Castell with a trumpet; answere to it below; Enter Alexander vpon the walls as before. Alex. What come yee to make pillage of the Church, Which held you deere as her chiefe Champion? For beare your violence in the name of God: Fearing the scourge, and thunder from aboue, Our offers are both iust and reasonable: Cæs. Peeces which are of more validity We meane to tender to your Maiesty. Char. What are those peeces you would tender vs. Alex. To render presently the Cittadells Of Terracina, Ciuita Vecchia, and Spoleto. Char. And we receiue them very thankfully. S. Pad vin. Our voices of the c?claue passe, that Charles Shalbe possest of Castell Angelo. As. And if your meaning with your words accord We dare ingage our soules for resurrender. Ale. Your soules? foh foh they stinck in sight of God &amp; man, Your soules? why they be sould to Lucifer, Your consciences are of so large a last That you would sell Saint Peters Patrimony, As Esau did his heritage for broath. S. Pee. ad Vi. Thou most prophaine &amp; impious Moabite; So full of vices and abominable, No Pope but Lucifer in Peters Chaire. As. Renowned Charles pull downe this Antichrist; Aduance some worthy father in his place. Your fame shall liue with all posterities VVho from a wicked Bishops tiranny Infranchised the Church of God misguided; Euen as (in this worlds worthy memories) The names of Pepin and King Charlemaine Your predecessors, were eternized For helping good Popes, Saints of Holy life, Out of vngodly persecutions. Lodo. A Pope by nature full of fraud, and pride; Ambitious, auaritious, shameles, diuilish, And that and which your experience testifies) One that with mortall malice hates the French: By whome this reconcilation made Was more in feare, and hard necessity Then faithfull inclination, or good will. Alex. Iscraiot, reprobate apostata, I charge thee to desist and make submission VVith pennance to the Mother Church of Rome On paine of euerlasting reprobation. Asca. Blasphemous exorsist, heere are no diuills VVhich thou canst coniure, with thy diuilish spirit. We charge thee render vp that triple Crowne Which most vngodly man thou dost vsurp. Those robes pontificall which thou prophanest, Saint Peters Chaire wherein (like Antichrist) Thou doest aduance thy selfe thou man of sinne. Sa. P. ad Ui. Saint Peeter doth make challenge to those keyes, Which (in those hands defil'd with bloud and bribes) Thou like a prophane deputy dost hold. Ascan. That sword (with which thou sholdst strike Antichrist) Thou like proud Antichrist, conuerted hast Vpon the members of Christes chosen flocke; Saint Paule demaundes his sword, Peter his keyes: Alex. Forbeare your blasphemies, what know yee not Christes Vicar generall chosen on earth? Haue not I power to binde and loose mens sinnes, And soules, on earth, in hell, and purgatory? Come take Saint Peters Chaire proud heretiks; Here take this triple Crowne, oh you would take it: But he, that made it, did not for you make it. Ascanio thou wouldst haue these Golden keies; Here take them with my vengeance on thy head, He throwes his keies. And Pseudo Paulus would haue Saint Paules sword, Ordained for his decollation. Sonne Charles (since we capitulato with you) Me thinkes you should not suffer these t'affront vs. Char. Forbeare your idle velletations, Angring and rubbing vp the festred scarres Of wrath inueterate, and mortall quarrels, We come not here to foster factions, All are in one accorded, all are friends. But yet most Holy-Father, let me craue, Two fauours more, both very reasonable; First that you pardon both these Cardinalls, And other Barons which pertake with me. Then that the brother of great Baiaset, That fled from Rhodes to France, and last to Rome, With the protection of Pope Innocent Call'd Gemen Ottoman, may be deliuer'd Into my hands, when after-time shall serue For my best vantage in those holy warres, Which we pretend against the Turkes here-after. Alex. The sunne shall neuer set vpon my wrath; That Oylie Lampe of blessed Charitie Shall not extinguish in my zealous heart: He that knowes all, knowes this I cannot falter With any brother, all are faithfull friends: Be but submissiue, milde, and penitent, And all is past, as all had beene well ment. Now touching Gemen Ottoman, sonne Charles, When you shall vndertake those godly warres, I will deliuer him as willingly As you demaund: and with a cheerefull heart, Praising your godly zeale on Christs behalfe, And praying for your good successe in warre. Char. I thanke your Holynesse. Lodw: These quarrels are as happily determined As we could wish: call for an Actuarie, And let a Charter Bipartite be drawne Betwixt you: to confirme this amity. And now most blessed Father I beseech, That I may shew the duty which belongs Vnto this place, and see Apostolick. Alex. We will regreete your presence presently. Drums and Trumpets: Charles and his company make a garde, Gasper de Fois, Piccolominy, Cæsar, Caraffa, Cardinals, a Frior with a holy water-pot casting water; the Duke of Candie with a sword, Astor Manfredy supporting Alexanders traine, all bow as the Pope marcheth solemnly through, who crosseth them with his fingers. Alexander being set in state, Cæsar Borgia, and Caraffa aduance to fetch King Charles, who being presented vnto the Pope, kisseth his foote, &amp; then aduancing two degrees higher, kisseth his cheeke: then Charles bringeth S. Peter ad Vincula, and Ascanio, which with all reuerence kisse his feete, one of them humbly deliuering vp his Crosse-keyes, which hee receiueth, blessing them and the rest of Charles his company: The Drum and Fife still sounding. Alex. Sonne Charles, your welcome is as acceptable, As euer was Kings presence into Rome: To morrow we will with the power of heauen, Together celebrate a solemne Masse: After the Senior, Bishop, Cardinall, You must take place: and as our custome is, Shall giue vs water when we celebrate: This done, we will bestow some time in pleasures. A garde for the Cardinals, French King, Frier and Pope: Enter with a solemne flourish of Trumpets, after whom the garde troopeth, with Drums and Fife. Enter Guicchiardine. Heere leaue we Charles with pompous ceremonies, Feasting within the Vaticane at Rome: From thence to Naples, where the peoples hatred Conceiu'd against the former Kings, made way For him, without resistance to the crowne. This done, he marcheth back againe for France, And Ferdinand doth repossesse his state. Meane while King Charles sick of an Apoplexie, Dyes at Ambois: the Duke of Orleance, Lewis the twelfth conioyntly knitting force, Doth march in armes with Ferdinand of Spaine, These regaine Naples and deuide that realme, But this breedes mortall warre betwixt them both, The wily Pope dissembles at all hands, The sequell onely concernes him and Cæsar.

Brother Phillippo what auaileth it, When our state lost the Fauintines compounded, That I should hold both life and liberty, With all reuenues of my proper state, When as my life within the Court of Rome, Is much more loathsome to my soule then death, And liberty more griefe then seruitude. Phil. I rather choose within the riuer Tiber To drowne my selfe, or from Tarpeyan hill, My vexed body to precipitate, Then to subiect my body to the shame Of such vild brutish and vnkindely lust. Ast. He that with fire and Brimstone did consume Sodome and other Citties round about. Deliuer vs from this soule-slaying sinne. To which our bodies are made prostitute, Enter Barnardo. Bar. Deare salutations from my Lord the Pope, I recommend vnto your excellence, With semblable remembrance of his loue, To you my Lord Phillippo, Ast. Good Barnardo. My dutie bound vnto his Holynesse, Returne in paiment from his Captiue seruant. Ber. Ingenious Prince, I bring a friendly message Of tender kindnesse, which I must impart: They draw them-selues aside. This Ruby from our Holy-fathers finger, (In priuate token of his faithfull loue) He bid mee secretly deliuer you: And there-withall, desireth of your loue, To haue with him some priuate conference. Ast. I was now going to our Ladies masse, In Saint Iohn Laterans; where my ghostly father Attendeth me for my confession. But thanke his Holynesse on my behalfe, In all due reuerence and humilitie. Tell him I meane—so soone as I returne, pawse. To come according to my bounden duty. Exit Bar. My case is desperate, what shall I doe? Phillippo, was there euer any man Hunted with such vnsatisfied rage? Phil. What hath he sent againe to visit you? Astor. To visit me, nay to dishonor me, Behold this Ruby sent from his owne finger, Which as a Bawde inuiteth me to shame. SCENA. 2. Alexander out of a Casement. Alex. Astor? what Astor? my delight my ioy, My starre, my triumph, my sweete phantasie, My more then sonne, my loue, my Concubine, Let me behold those bright Stars my ioyes treasure, Those glorious well attempted tender cheekes; That specious for-head like a lane of Lillies: That seemely Nose loues chariot triumphant, Breathing Panchaian Odors to my sences, That gratious mouth, betwixt whose crimosin pillow Venus and Cupid sleeping kisse together. That chin, the ball vow'd to the Queene of beauty, Now budding ready to bring forth loue blossoms, Astor Manfredi turne thee to my loue, Come hither Astor we must talke aboue. Astor. Betraid? a slaue to sinne? what shall I say? Most Holy father. Alex. Doe not mee forget: I am thy brother, and thy deerest friend, And though in age I loue know that desire In riper yeares is pure and permanent, Grounded on iudgement, flowing from pure loue: Whereas the loue lightning from young desire, Fickle and feeble will not long hold fire, It is so violent it will not last. They'r blest whose louers loue when youth is past. Astor. To call you friend were too familiar, To call you brother sorts not with our yeares: To call you Father doth import some feare, Due to that age your Holinesse doth beare. Alex. Tell me not of mine age and Holinesse, Thy sight sufficeth me to make me young: Neither vpbraide me with my sanctimonie, Loue is the purest essence from aboue, And to thy soule I would affix my loue. Come hither then and rest with mee to night, Giue me fruition of those amorous pits, Where blinded Cupid close in ambush sits: Who with his Arrow (when thou laught at Venus) Shot through thy smiling cheekes, and did inchaine vs. Thy Chamber with Ambrosiall odors breatheth, New loues and true loues vnto them that entreateth, And furious Mars made milde his Faulcheon sheatheth At thy delicious aspect: see thy Chamber: The walles are made of Roses, roofe of Lillies, Be not asham'd to mount and venture it, Here Cupids Alter, and faire Venus hill is. Thy bed is made with spice and Calamus, With Sinamond and Spicnard, Arabick, With Opobalsam and rich gums of Ægipt, Musick Angelicall of strings and voyces. With sundry birds in sugred simphony, Where whistling Wood-nimphes, and the pleasant choise is Of Antique action mixt with harmony, Attend thy ioyous entrance to this Chamber. Phil. Is it possible that the Diuil can be so sweet a dissembler? Ast. Yes and play the pleasant part of a conceited Amoret, For he can take the shape of a bright Angell. Alex. Now my sweet friend the ioyes of loue doth mutter Thy mind too bashfull is, speake tounge loues vtter, Thy Corrall gums cud loues pure quintisence, And thou thy selfe faire boy loues purest essence. Ast. Oh blessed heauens let Sathan tempt no longer, His force is powerfull yet thy strenght much stronger, He that with guilefull baites gilded vntruth, So seekes to blast the blossome of my youth. Allex. Delicious fruites diuine Confections, Of hearbes, roots, flowers of sundrie fashions. Preseruatiues drawne from the rich Elixar, Of finest gould pure pearle and precious stones, Prouided for thy diuine apetite, Wines of more price (made by th'industrious art, Insacred distillations) then that Nectar, Which Hebe bare, when Ioue did most affect her. Phi. Sathan false god of lies, and flatterie; How palpable is this grosse villaine? Alex. What wilt thou come Manfredi to my Chamber, And blesse me with thy precious breath of Amber. Asto. After our ladies Masse I will returne. Deare God what furies in his soule doe burne? After the Celebration of the Masse, I come my Lord. Exeunt Astor and Phillippo. Alexander tinkith a bell. Alex. Come then, and let that passe, Holla Barnardo? All busines for this night I will adiourne, Giue good attendance that at his returne, Astor may come to me for my sicke heart, Till Astor with his beauty full embrace, Doe blesse my body wounded with his dart, Can find no rest, loue hath it in hot chase. SCÆ. 2. Enter Cæsar Borgia the Cardinall, and Frescobaldy a ruffaine. Cæs. Wilt thou performe it faithfully? Fre. What I? will I liue to eate, to drinke, to sleepe? Cæs. Wilt thou performe it valiantly? Fres. Will I eate to drinke, will I drinke to sleepe, will I sleepe to liue? Cæs. Will thou be secret, and conceale my plot? Fres. My name is Frescobaldi, as for my pedigree, My mother was of consanguinitie with the Princesse Of Perugia: my father of the noble family of the Oddi, Florentine both: I my selfe Brought vp a Page vnder Rayner King of Sicily, Haue seru'd against the Turkes and Sarazines, Where at Uienna (with my single Pike, Arm'd in a Maly Briggandine of Naples, And with an old-Fox which I kept in store, A monument of Mars when I depart) I did vnhorse three Turkie Ianizaries. Then (in the warres of Ferdinand the King) This Hippe was shott through with a Crocadile, But that it were too tedious I could shew you: Vnder the King of Romaines I was cut, Iust from this shoulder to the very pappe: And yet by fortunes of the warre am heere, I thanke God, and my Surgion, all fix, trillill. I fought at Malta when the towne was girt With Sargeants heads, and bul-beggers of Turkie: And by my plot (niming below the rampier) We gaue th'obgoblings leaue to scale our walls, And being mounted all vpon that place: I with my Lint-stock gaue fire to the traine, And sent them capring vp to Capricornus. Which when the wise Astronomers of Greece, Prodigiously discouered from a farre. They thought those Turcaes fiery meteors. Which with their Pikes were pushing in the clowds, The learned Booke-men writte strange Almanacks, Of signes, and apparitions in the ayre: And by these honors (if I proue a blabbe) Then call mee villaine, varlet, coward, skabbe. Cæs. Then tell mee Frescobaldi Where I may send to thee when time shall serue. Fresc. Faith for the most parte my mansion is in Ciuitanechia nella sirada di san lorenzo, nere the conduict at a good olde Ladies house, la d?na sempronia at signe of the glister pipe, where if you chance to faile of mee. Within three houses more at signe of the frying-panne you may commande mee, at all houres in the fore-noone. Cæs. Well gramercie Frescobaldi I wil take the note of those houses in my tables. But be sure and ready when oportunitie calles vpon you. Fresco. May it please your most reuerend grace (without offence to your Lordship) to deliuer me the parties name vpon whome I should performe this Tragedy. For I may parcase catch him in a gilder my selfe before you are aware; and moylie mufle vp his maistership, with the garotta, or stiletto, perchance the ponyard or pistol, such as I warrant you shal serue his turne. Cæs. Be it sufficient thou shalt know hereafter, My businesse and affaires are very great: One word more, and adue. He rowndeth with Frescobaldi. Fre. Secret as mid-night, sure as the sunne, quick as the waters Cæs. Why? so sayd braue Frescobaldi like a man of some resolution farewell remember the watchward—do not faile. Fresco. My businesse and affaires are very great my gratious Lord, one word more with your grace my good Lord, and so I kisse your foote. He whispereth with Cæsar. Cæs. It was not ingratitud, neither forgetfulnesse in me Frescobaldi: Here take this and remember me. He deliuereth him a purse. Fres. I encounter your munificence with my loue, and your loue with my seruice, my loue and seruice with your mony. Padrone mio multo honorato, More for your loue then your mony, And yet your grace wel knowes, clothes must be wrought, weapons must be bought; and Tauerns must be sought, and all braue exploits must be done, as they should be done brauely. Cæs. But that I keepe my secret to my selfe; I would not vse this slaue for any gold: Yet when I trust him he shall not deceiue me. Exit Cæsar. Fresc. Now skelder yee scounderels, skelder you maggot-m?gers, you pompi?s; you wood-wormes, you magatapipicoes, I am for you, now Frescobaldi, call thy wits togither, let me now see what a clock it is: very neere eight, and almost breakfast time at a cleauen, this very night must I stand Perdue for this bloudy seruice. I know my place and houre; I must confesse and perchance be hang'd, I haue in the Burdelliaes and in other such houses of naturall recreation and agility, receiued three or foure score broken pates in my time: and some bastinadoes for crossing courting spicy-spirited inamoratoes in their humors. Besides I was the first that from the Swisse quarter, in the raigne of king Ferdinand brought vp in his army the fashions of bowsing and to vsing Greeke and Spanish wines by the flagon, with that old stinckard Henrico Baglioni, somtime Alferoes to Capitaneo Piccolomini &amp; my selfe; I remember likewise at Terracina I broake a glasse (contayning some quart of Robollia) vpon the face of Capitaneo Fransesco Boccansacchi a very sufficient souldier in that seruice, and to my knowledge a tall trencherman: howbeit from the teeth down-ward as base a mettled coward as euer was coyn'd out of the sooty side of a copper kettle; so he was: well I will second my Lord in any slaughter for his wages, and if any man will giue me better hiers (when I haue seru'd the Cardinalls turne) I will present my pistoll vpon his sacred person afterward for charities sake: well, now to the drinking schoole, then to the fence schoole, and lastly to the vaulting schoole, to my Lady Sempronia. Exit. Enter the Duke of Candie and Barbarossa. Can. This was an act of such strange consequence, As neuer yet was heard, a man found dead Within a priuate chamber of his house; When all his seruants stird: not one of them That could giue euidence of what befell But that he kill'd himselfe. Cosa impossibile. Bar. I was the first that found him in his bloud; Then warme from slaughter: such a ruthfull sight As yet I tremble to remember it. Can. It is impossible (after a search) No stranger found within Visellies doers, But that some seruant of his family Should haue sure notice how the murther was. Bar. It was his owne hand sure. Can. I cannot thinke it. The gentleman was honest, full of sport, And well affected. Bar. Pardon me my Lord, My Ladie Lucrece told it in great griefe She twise before had rescued his life. Can. Go too, go too. Bar. Besides my Noble Lord. Papers both writ, and sealed with his hand Were found about him't stifying this. Can. Good Barbarossa pray my sister Lucrece, Here to encounter me with her good company: Som-what I would in priuate talke with her. Bar. My Lord I will. Exit Barb. Can. High God be mercifull. Thou that doest know the secrets of al hearts, If Lucrece (as my father doth suspect) Was priuie to this murther of my life Enter Lucrece Barb with her. I can learne all she knowes. But yet I will not either suspect, or vrge her were it true Being indeede a violation of brother-hood &amp; common humanity She maketh towards me—sister how faires it with you? Luc. As with a dead Corse in a Sepulcher Cold liuelesse, comfortlesse, opprest with sorrow. Nor since my ioy did leaue me desolate Euer could I brooke well this open ayre But still lamenting and disconsolate Kept vp in Chamber, mourning for my Lord. Can. What order tooke you for his funnerall? Luc. He that aliue was shrined in my brest, Now dead liues yet intombed in my thoughts, There is a modell of it in my closet. Can. Performe it decently with dilligence. Lu. Brother me thinkes the ayre is cold and raw, And as you please let vs conserre within. Can. Gladly deere sister with what hast you may, And I desire you noble Barbarosa To meete vs at my Chamber after supper. My brother Cæsar hath appoynted with me Some businesse, and I craue your company. Bar. Thankes my good Lord: but matters of much moment, I haue at that time with my Lord Caraffa; And I must speake this night with my Lord Cæsar. Can. Tell him I will attend by nine of clocke. Bar. I will my good Lord. Cand. Farewell Barbarossa. Bar. Ioy to you both. Exit Barbarossa. Can. My trembling liuer throbs, my cold hearts heauy; My mind disturbed and I know not why But all as he will, heauens aboue for me. Exeunt omnes. SCEN. 5. Enter Frescobaldi solus. Fres. This is the black night, this the fatall hand: These are the bloudy weapons which must be Witnesse and actors of this Tragedy. Now Frescobaldi play thy masters prize: Here is a rich purse cram'd with red crusadoes Which doth inspire me with a martiall spirit, Now could I combate with the diuill to night. First did I wash my liuer, lungs, and heart. In Cretane wines and head strong Maluesse (Such as would make a coward fight with Mars) Then least I should with any weapons drawne Be driuen to danger of mine enemy; I practised my martiall feicts of fence: As for example if with armes vnsheath'd, I were to kill this conduct here I come. he fenceth. He makes a thrust, I with a swift passado, Make quick auoydance, and with this stoccado (Although he fence with all his finest force) Bar'd of his body thrust him in the throate. Guardateui bene, signori honoreuoli. Suppose this conduict or my duellist, Should falsifie the foine vpon me thus. Here will I take him, turning downe this hand. Enter Henrico Baglioni looking earnestly vpon Frescobaldi. Il punto verso indrizzato, thus. Admit he force me with his ambroccado Here I deceiue then, with this passado And come vppon him in the speeding place.

Braue man whose spirit is approued well, (As most aprooued panders truly tell) Vnder greene hedges, vnder Coblers stalles, In portall, porches, vnder batterd walles, Which day; by night keepes watch-full centinell To guaze the pleasures of faire Claribell Profane arch patriark of Pancridge steeple, The bauldy beaken of vngodly people.

Noble Henrilico question no further, My meditations are of bloud and murther, I ieasted haue too long, pree-thee be gone. Henrico Baglioni (by this sword) I am to morrow to performe a duell, And practising in this nights melancholie, How to dispatch it with a braue stoccadoe.

I am asham'd thou should'st be generall, To lead those forces that fight for the Church, And heere shew such faint harted cowardize. Can.

Summon thy sences and aduance thy selfe, Ware and Earth haue interpos'd their bodies, Betwixt the worldes bright eye and this blacke murther. Sweete silent night (guarded with secret starres) Keepe silence, and conceale this Tragedie; Saturne is lord ascendant of this hower, Propitious patron of assassinates Of murthers, Paracides, and massacres: Lord of my birth, auspitious to my life, This is my first degree to domination. Who can, or (if they could) who dare suspect, How Cæsar Borgia kild his brother Candie? This is infallible, that many crimes Lurke vnderneath the robes of Holinesse: And vnderneath my Purple tunicle This fact concealed is: Ascanio Sforza Shall strangely (by some wilie policies) Be brought into suspect for Candies death. Sister Lucretia thou must follow next: My fathers shame and mine, endeth in thee. Now shew thy selfe true Cæsar; Cæsar shall Either liue Cæsar like, or not at all. Guicchiardine. Death and bloud onely lengthen out our Scœne, These be the visible and speaking shewes, That bring vice into detestation, Vnnaturall murthers, cursed poysonings, Horrible exorcisme, and Inuocation, In them examine the rewarde of sinne.

I must and will finde him, though he went inuisible, Appeare appeare; not yet; ha and Candy murthered too, Let me looke forth. Alexander commeth vpon the Stage out of his study with a booke in his hand. Oh, oh, very good very good: well I perfectly peceiue. By this descention of Arctophilax, What time of night it is, sorrow giue place; Reuenge in blood and fierie sacrafice, Commaundeth: nature now preuents her current: yeeld, Let vs adore the second eye of heauen, he boweth his bodie. Bright Armatas increaseth she, is not combust. O sacred season for nocturnall Ceremonies. This ioyeous quarter is in Casmaran. ha. he looketh on a watch. What hower of night ist? why tis Salem, twelue a cloke, What are our angells this quarter? Gargatel Tariel Gauiel. How goodly these augurize faire auspices of truth, Now mountes bright Athaman in his goulden ascention, Direct in opposition with our hemispher, he tinketh on a bell. And now there hower with them is Aetalon: Bernardo bring hither thy white robes of sanctity, Hast thou Coles ready burnt bring in my Thurible, And sence about this sanctified place, For heere Festatiui must haue her honor. Candie my sonne is murthered, Candie my sonne, Candie my sonne is murthered: I will raise All the great diuills to shew the murtherer, Euen as thou lou'dst my sonne hast and dispatch, Hast and dispatch it as thou louest my soule. Tis not yet yawne by three quarters of an hower, What are our Angels of this night? Michael, Dardael, Huratipel In a triumphant carre of burning gold, Crownd with a circlet of blacke hebeny, And with a mace of Iet King Varca rides. Attended with his ministers of state, Andas and Cynaball. Fit dismall times for our solemnities. Enter Bernardo. Put on my robes giue me my Pentacle, Cense well Barnardo: bring me some fire in an earthen vessell Now must I laboure like a collyers horse. After Bernardo had Censed he bringeth in coles, and Alexander fashioneth out his circle then taketh his rod. My pretious best approu'd and trusty seruant, Hence in all hast be-take thee to thy beads, Whilst these darke workes of horror are in hand, Red Sand ill is my fumigation. standing without the circle he waueth his rod to the East.

I coniure thee by these aforesaid names, That thou receaue no phantasmatike illusions. Diue. What would great Alexander haue with vs, That from our fiery region millions of leagues, Beneath the sulphuro as bottome of Abisse, Where Mammon tells his euer tryed gould, Thou call'st me from strong busines of high state, From sure subuersions and mutations Of mighty Monarches, Emperors, and Kings, From plotting bloody feilds and massacres. Triumphant treasons and assassinates. Whats thy demand? Alex. I charge thee by the fower recited names, And by the dreadfull title of great Phaa. By which all creatures are sure sealed vp, By which the prince of darknes and all powers, In earth and hell doe tremble and fall downe, Shew me the shape of that condemned man, Which murthered my sonne the duke of Candy. Diu. Keepe a firme station stir not for thy life, Expect a messenger of trust stand fast, The diuell descendeth with thunder and lighning and after more exhalations ascends another all in armor. Diue. Sent from the foggy lake of fearefull stix. Am I comaunded by that puissant monarch, Which rides tryumphing in a charriot, On misty blacke clouds mixt with quenchles fire, Through vnquoth corners in darke pathes of death, To doe what thou demandest. Allex. Then by the dreadfull names of Amioram, Titepand Sadai shew me that damned childe of reprobation. Which this night murthered the duke of Candie. Diui. Keepe a firme station stir not for thy life, He goeth to one doore of the stage, from whence he bringeth the Ghost of Candie gastly haunted by Cæsar persuing and stabing it, these vanish in at another doore. Alex. Hold, hold, hold, hold; per todos santos now no more, Cæsar hath kill'd a brother and a father. Diue. What wouldest thou more shall I descend? Alex. Shew me the person by whose impious hand, Gismond Viselli, was done to death? Deue. Keepe a firme station stirre not for thy life. He bringeth from the same doore Gismond Viselli, his wounds gaping and after him Lucrece vndrest, holding a dagger fix't in his bleeding bosome: they vanish. Alex. Out, out, no more no more, my soule disolues. Deui. Say, say what wouldest thou more? discend, Alex. Beldachiensis, Berolanensis, Helioren, discende, discende, inbeo, mando impero.

Very neere six by Saint Peters bell Alex. Hast thee, then passe thee to my Poticary, bid him prouide those drugges I spoke for yester-day, and beare them in all hast to Dominico Giglio take you those letters with you which are here, bid him deliuer them Lodowick Sforzaes name her lustfull Paramoure; make hast and see that he dispatch it quickly, deliuer him a purse from mee for a token cramd with two hundred ducates, bid him bee secreat as he loues his life, hast and begon. Exit Bernardo. Astor shall follow, I must haue his Lands This thorne must be cut of being but tender Then cut it soone whilst it is yong and slender. Least growing great it prick thee to the bone My lust importunes it and he shall die, Sonnes, Nephewes, Daughters, Concubines, shall die. My conscience is turn'd mercies enemy, He that would rise to riches and renowne Must not regard though he pull millions downe. Exit Alexander into the studie. SCEN. 2. Enter Cæsar Borgia with Caraffa and Bentiuoli. Cæs. Where is his Holinesse? where is my father? Alas your Sonne is slaine; your haples Sonne, My noble brother out alas, alas Is murthered: in tender passion Let curious search and inquisition Be made through Rome to finde the murtherers: I feare that Traitrous Iudas Cardinall Ascanio Sforza with his complecies: I will not hould fraternity with him: And here behold my meaning blessed father: Receiue againe these robes, take here this hat, And in these armes which I haue bucled on I do forsweare al offices of Church, Vntill I be reuenged for his death. He disrobeth himselfe and appeareth in armor. Alex. A foule red vengeance ouer hangs his head Whose heart indurate or whose diuilish braine, Could execute conceiue or meditate So foule a murther of an Innocent. Caraffa with Bentiuoli giue leaue Some-what I would in priuate haue with Cæsar. Cæsar desemble not for that were vaine Exeunt Car. et Ben. Whence comest thou. Cæs. Directly from my Chamber. Ale. Where didst thou here this newes. Cæs. Fishers which found his body brought the newes. Alex. Then he was droun'd Cæsar was he not? Cæs. It seemes he was. Alex. What by some Fisher. Cæs. How should I know that. Ale. Sure by some subtill Fisher that layd nets For Candies life and honor: but say truly, Was it thy brother. Cæs. Are not you my father? Ale. Ah that I neuer had beene any father, But speake againe, man speake the truth and feare not: Who slew thy brother Candie this last night, Who traind him forth who walk'd along with him. Cæs. Am I the keeper of my brothers person. Alex. Execrable Cain; perfidious Homecide, Apparant villaine what canst thou designe? Which I would know that thou canst hide from me. Cæs. A plague vpon your diuills you deale with them, That watch more narrowly to catch your soule Then he which sought my brother Candies death, You know that Sathan is the lord of lies A false accuser and desembler, Tell your falce liers they be lying Diuils. Alex. Cæsar no more, Cæsar no more, thou knowst. Cæs. What know I? Alex. That I know, dissemble not. Cæs. Suppose you know, suppose in wrath &amp; fury I killd my brother; can we mend it now? He was not fashion'd for these busie times: He rests in peace, our peace rests in our swords. Alex. Cæsar thou do'st vnkindly vex my soule, With rubbing vp my secret miseries: Incur'd by seeking to lift vp thy head. Cæs. Pull me not downe good father with your conscience: Your conscience, father of my conscience is. My conscience is as like your conscience, As it were printed with the selfe-same stampe. I know my sinnes are burthenous, and beare them, Your sinnes more hainous, yet your robes conceale them. Alex. Out wicked and nefarious homicide. Cæs. Vpbraid me not, for if that Lampe burne dimme, Which should giue light to men in darkest night; How can they choose but must in shaddowes erre, That follow the blind-glimering thereof: Doth this one petty fault appeare so grieuous? Which if you well consider is no fault; He was an honest man, and fitt for heauen: Whilste he liu'd here he breath'd in miserie; And would haue beene enlarg'd: I set him free. Now if I may compare your state vvith his, Or your condition with my qualitie, Haue you not sold your selfe vnto the Diuill, To be promoted to the Papacie: Haue you not sould the liuings of the Church? Are not your coffers cram'd with beastly bribes. With foule extortion, and base Vsury? Haue yee not (since your inauguration) Poysoned and done to death six Cardinals; In diuilish auarice to get their goods? Haue you not (vvhich is most abhominable) Commited incest vvith your onely daughter; And made me sinne with her for company, That both might raigne in hell for company? Did you not take of Georgio Bucciardo One hundred thousand Ducats from the Turke, To kill his brother Gemen Ottamon? Haue you not kept the Pearle of Italie, Astor Manfredi that young vertuous Prince, In beastly lust, and filthy Sodomie. Blasting the blossome of his toward youth? Haue you not now giuen order for the death Of my deere Sister, whom your passions caus'd To kill her latter husband Di Viselli, And robd the noble Earle of his new spowse, Onely to cloake your vile impiety, Ale. Cæsar the Diuill hath bin thy Schole-maister. Cæs. I passe your secret counsell with the diuill, Your Auarice, ambition, perfidie, Your bloudie plots, inhumane crueltie, Why then vpbrayd yee mee with Candies death? A bastard of our house, degenerate, In whom no sparke or spiracle of honor, Appear'd to raise the race of Borgia. But had I beene Lieutenant of your forces, This arme had conquer'd all Romania, France before this had trembled, Spaine had stoop'd, The Romaine Emperor had faun'd vpon vs. King Charles had beene restraind, Frederick expulsd, And Naples had beene made our heritage. Alex. A triple ioy succeeds a single griefe, I haue engag'd all to make Cæsar great, Cæsar it suteth with thy grace and glory, To cloake my vices, I will pardon thine, Let one of vs excuse an others crimes, And for this bloudy fact so lately done. As thou didst cunningly begin proceed, To lay the guilt or imputation On them whose death may doe thee benefit: And neuer was my soule better contented, Then that our woes are with rich hopes preuented. Cæs. Now stands Romania subiect to my sword. Imola furli, Camerine, and Vrbine Shall haue the first charge, if I there succeed, Haue forward farther with a better speed, Cæsar o nullo written in my guydon, When with my troopes victoriously I ride on. Alex. Holla Bernardo, call in Caraffa with Bentiuoly: Enter Barn: Ay now now now, my precious boy, my Cæsar, Prosecute as thou hast begunne, With Arte, looke sullaine and demure, Hold downe thy head, like one swolne vp with sorrow, Enter Caraffa with Bentiuoly. They come, they come, say that those armes were put on, In reuenge of Candies death. The soueraigne medicine of things past cure, Is for to beare with patience and forget, Cæsar hath vowde reuenge for Candies death, And in regarde of Cæsars piety, I make him generall in his brothers place. Cæs. And neuer shall I sheath this sword in peace Till it haue wrought vpon the murtherer. Caraf. Happy successe accompany my Lord, And in your battles giue you victory. Bent. Is order taken for his funerals. Cæs. Bentiuoli take you no thought for that, That is the greatest care, which troubles me. Alex. Come on my Lords, we will aduise within, For I must haue your counsels in my griefe. Exeunt omnes. SCEN. 3. Enter Lucretia richly attired with a Vyol in her hand. Luc. Kinde Lodowike hadst thou presented me, With Persian clothes of gold or Tinsilry, With rich Arabian Odors, pretious stones, Or what braue women hold in highest price, Could not haue beene so gracious as this tincture, Which I more valew then my richest iewels, Oh Motticilla. Enter Motticilla. Bring me some mixtures and my dressing boxes, This night I purpose priuately to sup With my Lord Cardinall of Capua. Enter two Pages with a Table, two looking glasses, a box with Combes and instruments, a rich bowle. Bring me some blanching water in this bowle. Exit Motti. Shee looketh in her glasse. Here I perceiue a little riueling Aboue my for-head but I wimple it Either with iewels or a lock of haire, And yet it is as white as the pure snow: O God when that sweet Marques Mantoua, Did in Ferrara feast my Lord and mee, What rich comparisons and similies, He with ingenious fantasie deuis'd, Doting vpon the whitenesse of my browes? As that betwixt them stood the chaire of state, Compos'd of Iuorie for the Paphian Queene: Sitting in comfort after amourous conquest. And kist my for-head twenty thousand times. Oft haue I wisht the coulour of this haire More bright, and not of such a Spanish dye, And yet the Duke of Bourbon on his knees, As the diuinest fauour of this world, Did beg one lock to make a Bracelet, For which few haires he garnished my head With Iewels worth six thousand crownes at least. My beaming eyes yet full of Maiesty, Dart loue, and giue bright luster to the glasse, As when the sunne beames touch a Diamond. The Prince of Salerne solemnly did sweare, These eies were quiuers which such shafts did beare That were so sharpe, and had such fierie touch, As Cupids Arrowes neuer had so much, The Rosie Garden of these amourous cheekes, My nose the gratious forte of conquering loue, Breathing attractiue odors to those louers That languish and are vanquisht with desire, Gonzaga calleth it the siluer pearch, Where Venus turtles mutuall pleasure search. Sweet mouth the Ruby port to Paradice Of my worlds pleasure from whence issue forth, Many false brags, bold sallies, sweet supplies, A chinne the matchles fabricke of faire nature. A necke two brests vpon whose cherry niples. So many sweet solcions Cupid suckt, Giue me some blanching water in this boule, Wash my face Motticilla with this cloth, So tis well now will I try these collours. Giue me that oyle of Talck, Take sarsnet Motticilla smooth my forehead. She looketh in two glasses and beholdeth her body. I must delay this colour is it carnation right. Mot. Oh the true tincture of a damask rose, Luc. What is it excellent. Mot. Most full of life. And madame thats a pretious liniment, As euer I beheld to smooth the browes. Luc. I will correct these arches with this mullet. Plucke not to hard, beleeue me Motticilla, You plucke to hard. I feele a foule stincke in my nostrells, Some stinke is vehement and hurts my braine, My cheekes both burne and sting giue me my glasse. Out out for shame I see the blood it selfe, Dispersed and inflamed, giue me some water. Motticilla rubbeth her cheekes with a cloth. Lucretia looketh in the glasse. My braines intoxicate my face is scalded. Hence with the glasse: coole coole my face, rancke poyson, Is ministred to bring me to my death, I feele the venime boyling in my veines. Mot. Ah me deere Lady; what strang leoprosie? The more I wash the more spreads on your face. Luc. Send to my father; call phisitions in, Exit Motti Oh Candie where art thou my comforter, Dead and intomb'd; Lucrece must follow thee, I burne I burne, oh where is my deere Lord. My braines are seard vp with some fatall fire. Enter a seruant and Phisition with Morticila. Ser. Deere Lady cheere your selfe, be not dismayd, His Holines in hast hath sent releife: His owne Phisition to recomfort you. Luc. For our deere Ladies passion bring some water to coole my thirst. Phi. Madam you may not drinke, Till you receaue this one preseruatiue. Luc. A foule vnsauorie loathsome stinke choakes vp My vitall sences: and a boyling heat suppes vp the liuely spirit in my lungs. Phi. This poyson spreads and is incurable, Madame receiue one precious antidote. Luc. What haue I caught you Sforza, Who painted my faire face with these soule spots, You see them in my soule deformed blots, Deliuer me from that murthered man, He comes to stab my soule I wounded him, Oh Gismond Gismond hide those bleeding wounds, My soule bleeds drops of sorrow for thy sake; Looke not so wrathfull I am penitent Loue and remorse did harbour in thine hart, What doest thou becken to me I will come, And follow thee through millions of woes. Phi. Sweet Lady will you take a little rest, It will refresh your spirits instantly. Luc. No rest vntill I see my Lord againe. Mot. Deere Lady doe you loue your life, take rest, Shee taketh hold of Motticila. Luc. From the pure burning coles of true contrition. Me thinkes I see the liuely counterfet, Of catiue Cressed in her misery, Ingenderd out of hir disloyalty, Ah Moticilla whome I trained vp In cunning sleights and snares of filthinesse, Forgiue me for that sinne; liue and repent. Mot: Oh God forgiue me for my sinnes are great, And if his goodnesse lend my life some space, I will with pennance call on him for grace, And spend the remnant of my life in prayer. Luc: I can no more, death summoneth my foule, Open thy bosome father Abraham, Mercyfull father let thy mercy passe Extend thy mercy where no mercy was. Mercyfull father for thy sonnes deere merrit Pardon my sinnfull soule receiue my spirrit. Expirat Lucrece. Phi: Now is her soule at rest tis very strange, As well the cause as manner of her death, I haue beene studied in Hipocrates, In bookes of Gallen and olde Auecine, Obseru'd the cures of diuers learned doctors, In France in Spaine and higher Germany, Yet neuer met with such an accicent, Beare in her body I will in all hast, Bring wofull newes vnto saint Peeters Pallace, His Holinesse will grieuiously lament. Exeunt omnes. SCÆ. 4. Enter Cæsar and Barbarossa souldiers drums and trumpets. Cæs: Fellows in armes after our victories, Had in the first front of our happie warr, With men of hardy resolution, Now must we bend our forces against Furly, Where that prowd Amazonian Katharine, Dareth defiance in the face of warr, And yet our hopes are sure, all passage cleere, And she before I lodge this restles head, Shall beare the bondage of this victorie. Bar: These proud presuming spirrits of vaine women, Whose bloodlesse woundes are only bloody words, Talke without reason, fight without resistance, But on the face of grimme deuouring Warre, With frowning fore-head menacing his force, They fall downe on their backs as Venus did, When Mars beheld her with a Souldiers face, Cæs. Nay we must fight: I know the puissant spirit Of warlike Kate the pride of Italie, Sforzaes braue sister and old Riarioes widdow, Excellent valour, and deepe policie Must winne it, if we purchase at her hands. Bar. And yet we be before-hand with the Lady, Hauing surprized her treasure and her sonnes, As they were making their escape for Florence: What shall we trie renowned generall? And search her resolution. Cæs. Shall wee? doubt you not, Nay though the walles of Furly were of steele, These pledges should make passage for our powers, And what? shall we stoope for those twenty Ensignes, Which this last night haue enter'd their Ports, Nay were they ten to one within those walles, Cæsar (that carries Fortune in his Standerd) Would make them giue ground &amp; subiect them-selues. Bar. Speake then at once renowned generall, Shall we go Souldier-like to worke at first? Shall we salute her with our Cannon? Cæs. What? no Barbarossa not without a parlee, Fore-God I loue her, and admire her valour, And till we finde her words prooue empty squibs, We giue her all the noble rights of warre, Summon a parlee. Sound drum, answer Trumpet. Enter vpon the walles Countesse Katherine, Iulio Sforza, Ensigne, souldiers, Drummes, Trumpets. What haue wee Pallas come vpon these walles, To bring confusion of our companies: Doth proud Penthefilea liue againe, Which some-time raging in the Fields of blood, Made passage with her angry sword through millions. Kat. I tell thee Cæsar sonne of Alexander A booke befits thee better then a blade: Percase in scorne thou wilt reply the like, A distaffe fits me better then a pike. Know Cæsar had I now so many liues As here are stoanes or haires vpon your beards, I would forgo them al before this honor, Which my deere Lord Riario did leaue mee, The pledge of my deere loue his Childrens patrimony. Cæs. Speake in a milder key renowned Kate, I loue you well and all braue Sforzaes race Yet you must yeeld there is no remedy, It is the Churches right and I must haue it. Kath. Me thinkes a pulpet were more fit for thee, But did'st thou euer reade Saint Gregory: That he which hunteth for authority, Himselfe should gouerne direct and know well; He did a deede of danger that aduanc'd thee, For proud ambition violates all right. Cæs. Be not so bitter Kate a friend intreates you, But if intreaties will not, looke vpon mee: Heere standeth Cæsar, the sharpe scourge of Furly And were your fort fenc'd with as many men, As it is girt with stones Cæsar would haue it. Subdue them and make pillage of their goods And in resistance seale it with their blouds. Kat. What are your weapons sheathed in your throates? Is euery word a sword then shake hands Cæsar: Venter no further and we will be friends But if your words haue accents in keene swords, And end in bloud, then Cæsar looke on me: I with defiance turne swords in your throates, You shall not thrust that imputation Vpon our sex, for I will fight it out So long as I can stand vpon these walls. Cæs. You would repent it, if you knew the worst, Consider Kate be well aduised first. Kat. Cæsar at one word to discharge my conscience, Were there a Cannon there to be dischardg'd Vpon this fruitfull wombe the nurse of Children, And I sure peece mell to be torne withall, If I would not surrender vp this forte Your Cannon shot should plowe these bowells vp, That vow to God and my deere husband made: I neuer will infringe with perfedy: I know thee bloudy Cæsar: the dishonor, In yeelding vp thy reuerend purple roabes Which should protect widowes and Orphanes rightes, Appeareth well in taking vniust armes, To wrong the Widowes and the Fatherlesse Either fight Cæsar or forsake the field, Perswade thy selfe aliue I will not yeeld. Cæs. Then I will shew you what warres desteny, Prognosticates, bring forth her ransome hither Barbarossa bringeth from Cæsars Tent hir two boyes. If nature be not quite extinguished These pledges shall enfranchize you from warre I brought them to this purpose; that in them, You with your friends might liue in liberty. Kat. Neuer but with advantages deere Lord. Monster of misery what think'st thou Cæsar That I will yeeld mine honor for their safety? Be not deceiu'd thou hast surpriz'd my Children, Riarioes riches left in my tuition And borne out of these bowells; but deere boyes, Courage your selues I will defend your honors: I tell thee Cæsar these my boyes are taught To beare with patience fates ineuitable These carry Sforzaes spirit and their fathers; I dare gage life and aske them they will chuse, To lack their liues before they loose their honors. Cæs. Cæsar in this hath offered like himselfe, He proffereth to preserue your towne vntouch't: Your goods, your wiues, your liues, your liberties: But marke what fruites thy bitternesse brings forth, To make thine hard heart infamous for euer, Before thy face these boyes shall loose their liues If thou surrender not without more parlee. Kath. Bloudy Buysiris I defie thy malice, I spit defiance in thy cowards face. Traytour to God and man had'st thou beene Cæsar, Insisting on high tearmes of worth and honor Thou wouldst consider that their bloud is Noble, Thou wouldst consider that they be but children, Thou wouldst consider that thou art a warrier And that such noble bloud spilt with dishonor And tram'd in with insideous trechery, By God nor man in heauen nor earth below Can be forgotten or abolished. Barb. Braue generall you parlee with a woman, Whose heart is obstinate, whose hands are freeble, Seemeth in vaine and ouer tedious. Cæsar. Speake at a word cannon is my next parlee, You will not yeeld your state to saue their liues. Kath. I will not Cæsar. Cæs. Cut of both their heads. 1. Boy. Let vs intreat our mother noble generall, For to deliuer vp the state of Furly And will you saue our liues then. 2. Boy. Good Captaine do not kill vs. Cæs. If she will yeeld the state your liues are safe. 1. Boy. Good mother for my fathers sake that's dead, And for mine Vncle, sake part of your bowells And for our owne sakes yeeld your selues and saue vs. 2. Boy. Good sweete mother saue vs. Kat. Poore boies, in heart vnlike Riarioes race, Or Sforzaes warlike linnage by the mother Know what it is die with liberty, And liue with ignomineous seruitude. If you your liues buy with the losse of states It were of all extreameties the vilest But in extreamety to die resolu'd Preseruing state and reputation: Is said to dye within the bed of honour, This is an honor for Riarioes children, And for my part, it neuer shall be sayd, That Katherine being strong vpon hir guarde, Hauing good forces able to defend, In brutish feare should giue away your states, I rather will obtrude my selfe vnarm'd, And meete the thickest ranckes that enter breach, To be tost vp vpon their souldiers pikes, Sooner I will set all the towne on fire, And with my soldiers sacrifice my selfe, Rather then render vp your heritage, Cæs. Oh brauely spoken warlike Amazon. 1. Boy. Mother we scorne death in respect of honor Let him performe his worst, we feare him not, Courage sweete brother, thinke vpon my father, I will dye first, be not affraid of death. Cæs. Why then you are resolu'd to dye? 1. Boy. I to dye Cæsar. Cæs. Bring hether both their heads. Kath. Gods blessing rest with you my deerest sonnes And if I loose your states, my life shall follow, Nothing but violence shall force it from vs, Ere long this quarrell twixt vs will stand euen: Farewell deere boyes, till we three meete in heauen. 2. Boy. Ah deere Mother, sweete mother, good Vncle Iulio saue our liues. Cæs. Away with him. 2. Boy. Let me before I dye, but kisse my mother. Kath. What wouldst thou runne againe into my wombe? If thou wert here thou shouldst be Posthumus, And ript out of my sides with soldiers swords, Before I would yeeld vp thine heritage. 1. Boy. Come brother let vs brauely dye together. Cæs. I tell thee when that these haue lost their heads, I will make sacke and pillage of your state, Man, women, Orphanes, all put to the sword, This hath your obstinacie wrought in vs, Carry them hence, bring hether both their heads. Exeunt with the boyes, And then a charge vpon this valiant Lady, This Thamyris, this proud Semeramis, Whose valour Barbarossa by these heauens, Is very wonderfull and glorious. Kate. Had he more force, what would this tirant do? Cæs. A charge a charge. Kat. For Gods sake charge, a charge let vs to sight. Cæs. A spirit full of vengeance, wrath, and spite, Assault, assault, charge noble hearts a charge. A charge with a peale of Ordinance: Cæsar after two retreates entreth by scalado, her Ensigne-bearer slaine: Katherin recouereth the Ensigne, &amp; sighteth with it in her hand. Heere she sheweth excellent magnanimity. Cæsar the third time repulsed, at length entreth by scalado, surpriseth her, bringeth her downe with some prisoners. Sound Drums and Trumpets. Cæs. Couragious Kate, you that would throw defiance Into the face and throate of fate and Cæsar, Such are the fruites of pride and wilfulnesse. Haue I perform'd my word? are you surpriz'd? Is not your life and liuing in my power? Kat. Now that my sonnes first by insidious meanes, Bereaued of their liues, and their states lost, The date of my calamities is out, Goe forward with thy tyrannie, strike Cæsar, And take away the Mother with her sonnes: This done, recount what is thy victory. A woman with two children vanquished, A prize befitting the renowne of Cæsar. Cæs. Come hither Katherine wonder of thy sex, The grace of all Italian woman-hood: Cæsar shall neuer prooue dishonourable, Behold thy children liuing in my Tent. He discouereth his Tent where her two sonnes were at Cardes. 2. Boy. Oh mother, mother, are you come, wee be not dead. 1. Boy. Good mother, thanke the Captaine, we liue yet, They gaue vs spices, wines, and bad vs welcome, I pray you thanke them. Kate. Oh but your lands and honors are both lost, Had not an honorable death beene better: Then thus to loose your states and liuely-hoods. Heroike souldier, whose deceipt is honour. Thou that hast vnexpected sau'd the liues Of my two children, I submit them here Thy captiues, for their ransome what is fitt. Cæs.

Enter Astor and Philippo in their wast-cotes with rackets. Ast. This set was strangely lost I durst haue wagerd, An hunder'd ducats after the first chase. Phi. You thinke you play well, but beleeue me brother, You cannot take paines nor obserue a ball, With that dexterity which appertaineth. Ast.

Performe his promise we shall soone returne. Ast. This wine was good yet tasteth of the casck, It hath a musty rellish. Phi.

I thinke it good after this little rubbing to repose my body. Phil. I am some what heauy. Ber. I know the cause, Ast. And what Bernardo. Ber.

Sleepe both seeme vpon your fatall bed, Now that the God of silence Morpheus, Hath with his signet of black horne seal'd vp, Your langued eye lids loaden with pale death, Sleepe vntill you draw your latest breath, Poore harmeles boyes strangers to sinne and euill, Oh were my soule as innocent as yours! This office is of highest consequence, In friendship for I consider it, I sent you from a million of sorrows, Into the flowry fields of Paradice. Their to goe habit in the groues of mittle, To feed on Manna and to drinke pure Nectar, A cup of euerlasting happines. Where such sweet musick vn-con-ceiueable, Shall entertaine your senses in sweet comfort, As the delight thereof shall neuer die Astor what Astor speake awake Phillippo, Both fast a sleepe. He stireth and moueth them opening both their bosomes. Now Roderick betake thee to thy taske, What? peace Astor begins to talke I will attend. Astor speaketh in his sleepe. Ast.

Oh goulden light of neuer setting Sunne, Harke brother Astor harke my soule is rapt, Into the ioyes of heauen with harmony. Alex. Doe they not sleepe? are they not yet a sleepe? Be not their sences yet lockt vp in sleepe. he stirreth them. Astor awake awake, awake Philippo. All safe and sure, oh this was but a dreame, Their Genius hath fore told them of their end, And ioyfully they doe shake hands with death. He draweth out of his boxes aspiks. Come out here now you Cleopatraes birds. Fed fat and plump with proud Egiptian slime, Of seauen mouth'd Nylus but now turn'd leane: He putteth to either of their brests an Aspike. Take your repast vpon these Princely paps. Now Ptolamies wife is highly magnified, Ensigning these faire princely twins their death, And you my louely boyes competitors, With Cleopatra share in death and fate. Now Charon stayes his bote vpon the strond, And with a rugged for head full of wrath He thrusts a million from the shore of Stix, To giue you waftage to the Elisian fields, I see their coulors chang and death sittes heauy. On their fayre foreheads with his leaden mace. My birds are glutted with this sacrefice. He taketh of the Aspiks and putteth them vp in his box. What now proud wormes? how tasts yon princes blood. The slaues be plump and round; in to your nests, Is there no token of the serpents draught, All cleere and safe well now faire boyes good-night. Bernardo, Bernardo, the feate is done, Vse thy discretion as I did detect. Exit Alexander. Ber. Tis done in deed alasse they both be dead: Now must I follow my directions, Holla within there. Enter Cardinall Caraffa with Bentiuoli. Car. What newes Bernardo? Ber. Alas my Lord ill newes, But that his Holinesse is fast a sleepe, And this day stir'd not from his bed-chamber I would haue brought him to this wofull sight: Prince Astor with Phillippo was at Tennis, And being ouer-heated at their game, Drinking so suddainly vpon that heate, With much sweete Wine did surfet instantly, And here alas lye dead vpon this bed. Bent. Alas it is a ruthfull spectacle, Two princely boyes of noble disposition, Endued with honorable gifts of vertue. Car. Of gracious fauour, wise, and liberall. Phaerizaes hope: Bernardo beare them in, His Holynesse will much bemone their fate. Bent. My Lord, my Lord, I do not like of this. Caraf. Peace man, no more do I, but beare with patience. Bent. It is suspicious but we may not talke, Come let vs in, oh God! Car. Oh God what times are these. Exeunt omnes. Guicchiardine. After the bloudy Duke Valentinoys Had conquered Furly, with the warlick Lady, By wily force he tooke in Capua, Then through insidious sleights and treacheries, He did surprize the state of Camerine, Where he captiued Iulio di Varana, With his two sonnes all which he strangled, With semblable tyranny proud Cæsar, On termes of trust meetes with the Duke Grauina, And Vitellozzo with the prince of Fermo: Whome he betraide at Sinigaglia, Bereauing them both of their states and liues, He conquereth Urbin; and with violence, Performeth strange and hiddeous outrages. By this time with his forces backe to Rome, Cæsar is marching; what betyded there, Endes in the subiect of this Tragedie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS. 5. SCÆ. 1. Enter Cæsar after a florish of trumpets with Drums, ensignes, soldiers, Barbarossa, Cardinall Caraffa Bentiuogli. Baglioni. Cæsa. Now that by cunning force and pollicie, All the free states and citties of Romania Subiected are vnto the Church of Rome. And that our pikes and swordes in blood and slaughter, Are staind and sheath'd quiet in our scaberds, Our blood and wounds stanch'd and bound vp in scarfs, Let vs for this could season of the yeare, Rest vs and cheere our selues till the next spring. And then march forward with alacrity. Braue Barbarossa take these souldiers, Vnto some quarter where by sound of drum, According to their muster giue them pay, Let them be satisfied and so dischargd. Fellowes in armes faithfull and valiant, I thanke you for your paines and honesties, In token of our good heart to your seruice, Wee giue each common soldier more then pay, Two ducates: and all other officers. According to their place redoubled, With many thankes for your exceeding valor, Assuring you that in these warres with vs, Cæsar shall make you Captaines of your spoyles, And so doth he commend you to your ease. Sold. A Cæsar a Cæsar God saue Cæsar. Exit Barba. Sound trumpets and a florish with drums marching with soldiers. Cæsa. Sirra come hether you must wayte on me. My good Lord Cardinall and Bentiuoli, Much thankes and deere acceptance of your loues, I louingly returne for your great paines. Caraff. His Holinesse gaue vs in serious charge, To giue you greeting and withall prepares A sumpteous feast for that solemnity, To which he doth inuite the Cardinalls With other Lords your fauourers in Rome. Cæs. Humbly commend my duty to my father Tell him this night I purpose to be with him, Pointing at letters in his hand. Tell him I liue in health and touching these, I pray you certifie his Holinesse, I will haue speciall care: and so my Lords For a small season I will take my leaue. Ben. We do congratulate your safe returne. Exit Caraffa &amp; Bent. Casar looketh on his letters. Cæs. Come hither Baglioni speake sincerely, Knowst thou Brandino Rotsi th'apothecary. Bag. What I my gratious Lord? know I my selfe? Cæs. How should I know that sir? Ba. May it please your highnes he serues his Holines. Cæ. He did indeed somtime and for his villanies, Is worthily cast of; but tell me sirra: Thou do'st remember how for breach of armes When thou didst stab a certaine lance-prizado: I pardon'd thee thy life. Bag. True my good Lord I very well remember, He was a lowsie villaine, marry was he, And if he liued yet such is my stomacke, That were he chopt in mammockes I could eate him: But for that honour in a souldiers word Ile spend my life to do your highnesse seruice. Cæs. Hast thou thy peece then ready. Bag. Oh my good Lord lies fix, sound as a bell, With all my warlike furniture beside Good flask and touch-box, a Valentia blade A slauish dagger, powder of Rhemes and bulletes Here they beene. Cæs. Somtime this after-noone within the parke, Next, to the Vattcan, Ratsie wilbe: And as I know thee stout and resolute, Bestow a bullet on him as he passeth; Few words; if any man attach thee for it, By my protection thou shalt be enlarged. Bag. And if I do not my good Lord damme me for it I haue an old grudge at him cole black curre, He shall haue two steele bullets strongly charg'd Nay but heere me my Lord? Ile tell you what, By this true fox of steele I had as good a spaniell for the water, As euer hunted ducke: and this true villaine Because my dog did eate vp a pannado Within his house; what did that Spanish roague? What did he thinke you my Lord? Marry very faire and instantly Poysond my Spaniell with Rosa-solis, A pox on him micher, faith ile pay him his olde fippence for't now. Cæs. Take this to buy thee clothes my trusty seruant, Nay tis gold be not affeard of it. Bag. Affeard my Lord Were it a tempest in a showre of gold I would indure it and adore you for't. Cæs. Then Baglion fit thee, to thy furniture, Watch in a corner close beyond some tree: And when the deed is done repaire to me: Say that thy peece went off against thy will, Keepe a light match in cock, weare flaske and touch-box: And take a murren with thee so fare-well; Thus must I diue deepe in a villaines nature, And thus must saue a villaine from the gallows To play my partes in others purposes. The man whome I to benefit would choose, I must in matters of more moment vse: Or els I will not benefit a man, And cut him of in sequell if I can. Bag. Here me, but my good Lord marke my words well, If old Henrilico shrink in this seruice Casseir him, call him whip-stock, let him perish, For want of Spanish wines, and maluasie. Cæs. Then faile not my true seruant finely, closely. Exit Cæs. Bag. No more, but by this crosse, Why now this Noble Cæsars like himself, Hath fitted me with seruice: if the world, Had sought out som-what to content a man, Nothing could better please old Ballion Then to kill a raskall, coward, curre, A Spanish squirt-vp, a black poysning toade. I like this trading better then the warres For there I serue for two ducates a month, And not a duck egge richer when I march And in continuall hazard of my life For which percase my peece kills twenty persons: Now shall I march in purse with many ducates, For one houres seruice but to kill one man, Free from all danger of mine enemy, I will about it and take vp my stand. Exit. Enter Bernardo. Bern. Thus doth one hideous act succeed an other, Vntill the mouth of mischeife be made vp: Now must I traine my fellow to his death, A deed of ruth and I did sweare the same, Not only for the secrecy thereof. But to conceale a matter of more weight, Of greater moment and high cruelty: When any deed of murther must be done, To serue his Holinesse, call for Bernardo. He must be principall or accessary To serue all purposes; for gold or pardone, The Pope giues both; and I can take them both: Gold can make hard the softest conscience, And mine is harden'd by the practise of it. Holla Signeor Bandino. He knocketh at a dore, Enter Rotsie. Rot. Who calls without there? what my good fellow Bernardo? Very welcome: what newes with you? Ber. My Lord hath sent me for the things he spake of. Rot. Here they be very strong and sufficiently compounded According to directions from his Holinesse, And speciall warrant vnder his priuy signet I tried them on three men condemn'd to death: For rapine and vile murther: but the first Within lesse then one quarter of an houre, Puft vp, grew leaprous and his heart strings broake; Then did I giue allay the second time, Enter Baglioni with his peece. The second prizoner died within three houres I did the third time mittigate, a little, And saw when it was minister'd the third man, Who did within eight houres swell, rage and die. Ber, Well haue you done your part, set downe your bottels, And read this letter from the Duke Valentinoys, He setteth downe his bottels and walking readeth to himselfe. Bag. Well sayd braue Pincoginger, by mine honour Before I do this seruice lie there peece. For I must haue a saying to those bottels, He drinketh. True stingo stingo by mine honour. Oh that mine old friend and Boccadillio Frescobaldi We are heare aliue againe to taste of this other bottle, Well I will venter vpon it, that I may drinke one health To Frescobaldi, I will encounter with this stout Hectorean, Greeke. Were Meleager here that slew the boore. Like a Boracchio armed all in sacke, Or stoute Achilles in a pewter coate, Or old Assaracus armed in a wicker Iyrkin, Or Priamus armed with a leather Iacket, Lin'd and imbost with Alligant and Hollock By forch of armes and Mars his valiant hand, I would encounter them whilst I could stand. The slaues are buisie reading their paphlagonian papers, I must haue a saying to you sir I must; though, You be prouided for his Holmes owne mouth; I will be, Bould to be the Popes taster by his leaue. Now trusty Troylus, base los manos. Rot. Let him alone it is the Dukes pleasure, That if he will taste he shall be suffered, And therefore I was commanded to set them downe, In presence of such a fellow whome for his sawcinesse, I haue pepered. Bern. Oh tis a perilous villeine if you knew him so well as I, beleeue me he would peper you for it if he vnderstood so much, peace man he hath broken vp the bottle let him drinke. Rotsi. Nay let him drinke and burst, for beleeue me I was enform'd before of such a fellowe; for whome I was commanded to lay bate; oh notable villeine, how he sealeth death. Brg. This is a Noble nipster ifaith, so so. He drinckth. Backe againe to kennell slaue. Rot. He hath his full wages dout not Bernardo, to serue him till he die, seeme not to respect him in any case doe I pray you. Ber. Nay but doe not you respect him, least he doubte you suspect him. Rot. Oh doubt you not, doubt you not, I wil neuer looke, let vs turne our talke. Tell his Holinesse tis well compounded and composed of all those drugges mentioned in your letter, giue the Duke right humble thankes for his token, and with all reuerence kisse his excellent hand. Bern. And by this signet you are to deluiuer me the bottles. Rot. Haue a care of them and deliuer them. Bernardo receaueth the bottles. Ber. Farewell fellow Rotsi. Rot. Adieu Bernardo. Ber. Now doe not I pitty this Spanish villaine because hee consented to the poysoning of this soldier, but for that I am innocent. They goe forth two seuerall wayes and Rotsi is shot by Baglioni. Bag. What is the wild goose fallen? haue at you Sir, might a poore soldier speake halfe a score woords to your venemous worship and according to your accustomed surlinesse haue no reply all: I beleeue you sir, your wordes are not offenciue in any sort I must confesse. Now thou infectious slaue, thou compictious Rascal, thou confectionary villeine: where is you sublimatum now sir? where is your Ratsbanatum now? now where are your poysoned pullets in stued-broth? where bee they? you neuer drempt of a poysoned bullet, did you goe too? now Signor currigantino will I romage in the worme eaten keele of your rotten hulke: passion of my soule what papers are these.

I I gaue charge to Bernardo, Hauing them safely seald with mine owne signet, That when feasting I do call for wine, He shall breake vp the seales and fill that out, For the two Cardinalls Cornetto and Modina. Alex. Tis well, now if our plot proue right, Thou shalt be maister of much welth to night, Dying in estate all comes to my share, Caraffa loues a sallet passing well, And I haue fitted one to serue his turne, Their gould will make thy soldiers fight in blood, And winge thy victories with good successe.

Alexander vnbraced betwixt two Cardinalls in his study looking vpon a booke, whilst a groome draweth the Curtaine. Alex. You talke of pennance and of penitence, Compunction with contrition and remission For all my sinnes; I pray you thinke of yours You vex your selues too much I cannot thank you, Haue patience sirs; oh tis a goodly exorcisme Quem penitet peccasse pæne est innocens Giue leaue, giue leaue, come hither when I call Eyther mere fooles or good phisitions all. They place him in a chayre vpon the stage, a groome setteth a Table before him. Nay leaue me good my lords, faine would I meditate, Leaue me I pray you. Caraf. We leaue our praiers with your Holinesse, Call vpon God, thinke of his endlesse bounty. Ale. Pray for your selues, troble not me with praiers, I pray you troble not your selues with praying. Alex. solus. What is repentance? haue I not forgotten? He looketh vpon a booke. Why repentance is a spirituall martiredome, Which mortifieth sinnes and heales the soule: Hauing beene wounded with the spirits sword This sword Gods booke: that booke by me profain'd And by which booke of God my soule is damn'd, I damn'd vndoubtedly. Oh wretched Alexander, slaue of sinne And of damnation; what is he that can Deliuer thy poore soule? oh none but he That when thou didst renounce him cast of thee, Repentance is in vaine, mercy too late, Oh why should miserable mortall man, Whose languashing breath liues in his nostrills Vex and torment himselfe with dayly trauell To scrape vp heapes of gold to gape for honors? What were the conquests of great Alexander: Of Cyrus, Cayus Cæsar? what were it To be possessed of this vniuerse And leaue it all behind him in a moment? Might some one man attaine that happinesse Which our first Adam had in Parradice, Before he did preuaricate? why then It were a worke oflasting worthinesse To rippe the bowells of our mother Ops For treasure; and to conquer all the world, Because eternity would promise it, Out, out alas my paines, my guttes, my liuer And yet I feare it not: though in security Once more I will with powrefull exorcismes, Inuoke those Angells of eternall darkenesse To shew me now the manner of death. Alexander draweth the Curtaine of his studie where hee discouereth the diuill sitting in his pontificals, Alexander crosseth himselfe starting at the sight. Diu. What dost thou start foule child of reprobation Vaine are thy crosses, vaine all exorcismies, Those be no fruites of faith but mere hypocrisie: Signa te signa temere me tangis &amp; angis Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor. Rome Which once was thy gorgeous concubine Hath now forsaken thee: now doth she finde, Thy falshood which did her adulterate What dost thou tremble slaue of sinne and hell? Alexander taketh his booke of Magike, the Diuil laugheth. Alex. I exorcise thee foule malignant spirit In the names of, of, of— Diuil. Of what? foule mouth, poluted soule? Corrupted flesh; God hath forsaken thee, Thy date expired is, thy powre determined. Alex. Dissolue, dissolue, break, breake, black soule dissolue, And poyson all this hemisphere with sinne. Diu. Thy death and dissolution stand at dore, Resolue now to dissolue, thy soule is ours. Alex. Proud Lucifer Traytor, to great Iehouah, Father of lies my time is not expir'd I will not do that violence to God, Taking that which is his from him To be bestow'd on his great enemy. Diu. Thou that hast throwne those graces in his face, How canst thou think vpon saluation? Think that th'art damn'd. I will declare it plainely. They sit togither. Alex. Seauen years are yet to come, I look for them. Diu. Examine thy soule with this counterparte. Alex. Behold it? is it not for eight years &amp; 8. daies? Diu. Thou foole examine in Arithmetik, Numbers without distinction placed thus. Annos with the figure 11. signifying eleuen years, &amp; the figure, Seauen applyed to Dies importing seauen daies. Alex. How? how? how? how? howes that? Deh quella malitia del Diabolo: Deh quello veleno del inferno. And for what stands this figure then? Diu. Why for eighteene this figure stands for octauo referred vnto die last before, signifying th'eight day after, so that Annos vndicem without distinction signifying eleauen years; and this figure seauen added to daies; and that octauo post, importing the eight day following, moriere, thou shalt die. I meane thy bodie with thy soule in respect of Heauen. Thus many daies hast thou continued Pope, And this is thy last day design'd by fate. Alex. Thou canst not mock me with thy Sophistrie, My soule is more diuine and cannot perish. Diuil. Thy soule foule beast is like a Menstruous cloath, Poluted with vnpardonable sinnes. Alex. Know then malignant Angell of confusion, My soule is a diuine light first created In liknesse liuely formed to the word, Which word was God, that God the cause of causes, My soule is substance of the liuing God, Stampt with the seale of heauen, whose Carracter Is his eternall word, at which hell trembles. Diuil. And what of that? thou therein hast no part, I do confesse thy soule was first ordayn'd To good: but by free-will to sinne thou slaue, Hast sold that soule from happinesse to hell. Alex. Marke yet what I can answer for this soule. Mightie Iehouah most exuperant, Two creatures made in feature like himselfe, The world and man: world reasonable and immortall, Man reasonable, but dissoluble and mortall, And therefore man was called Microcosmus, The little world, and second tipe of God, Conteyning those high faculties and functions, And elements which are within the world. Man then that doth participate with all, Through operation, conuersation, and simbolisation, With matter in the subiect properly, With th'elements in body quadrifarie, With growing plants in vertue vegitatiue In sence with beasts; with heauens by th'influence Of the superiour spirits into th'inferiour In wisedome and capacitie with Angels, With Eloym in that great continent, Is without doubt preserued by that God, Finding all things conteined in himselfe. Diuil. Answer me vaine Philosopher to this, Thou that hast planted man in this perfection, Not looking on thy detestable soule, Which first like a pure leafe of whitest Lilly, Cleere from all blemish was bestow'd by God, And thou foule beast didst shamefully polute it. Is it not one of humaine faculties, To propose for your selues the best you can, Where other creatures carryed with blinde force, Make them-selues bond-slaues to the present time. The scope of mans creation was to glorifie The most all potent maker of all things, The Alpha and Omega of all bountie. But he that wilfully betrayes this soule, That pretious Iewell wherein God delights, Dishonors God and doth depriue himselfe, Of all saluation and beatitude. Alex. Rest with this answer, that my soule is Gods Whose habitacle is prepar'd in heauen. First it doth know God being figured According to that Image of himselfe, And then the world whose liuely shape it beares, And to conclude, the soule of man knowes all, Because with all things it doth simbolize, For in this Man there is a minde intelligent, A quickning word and a celestiall spirit, That like a lightning euery way diffused, All things which are made by the mighty power, Vniteth, moueth, and replenisheth. Diu. These things should haue beene thought vpon before, The summum bonum which liues in the soule, Is an eternall pleasure to behold, And haue fruition of the mightie power. Which thou didst neuer see, nor canst enioy. Alex. Pawse yet a little, let me meditate. Alexander holdeth vp his hands wringing and softly crying. Mercy, mercy, mercy; arise arise: vp, vp, vp: fy, fyino, no? stirre stubburne, stonie, stiff indurate heart not yet, vp. why, what? wilt thou not foule traytor? to my soule? not yet? The Diuill laugheth. Arise, arise, aduaunce heart clogg'd with sinne, Oppressed with damnation: vp aduaunce yet. Wilt thou not stirre stiffe heart? what am I damn'd? Yet a little, yet a little, oh yet: not yet? alas. High God of heauens and earth if thou beare loue, Vnto the soule of sinfull man shew mercy, Mercy good Lord, oh mercy, mercy, mercy. Oh saue my soule out of the Lyons pawes, My darling from the denne of blacke damnation, My soule, my doue, couer with siluer wings, Her downe and plumage make of fine tryed gould, Help, help, help, aboue stirre, stirre, stupiditie. Diu. He charmes in Dauids words with Iudas spirit, Alex. It will not, no it will not, yet alas, no, no, no? is that my sentence to damnation? I am vndone, vndone. Diuill. He shall dispaire, vassall of sinne and hell, Prouide thy selfe in black dispaire to dwell. He ceazeth on his face. Alex. I tell thee I cannot be resolu'd, To dwell in darkenesse breake black soule dissolue, And poyson all this Hemisphere with sinne, Heere Alexander is in extreame torment and groneth whilst the diuill laugheth at him. Alex. And if I may not reach that happinesse, Since for my sonnes sake I my selfe inthral'd, Tell me shall Cæsar die this death with me? Diuill. Cæsar; his youth and strength of blood driues out This fatall poyson and shall liue a while. Alex. Oh shew me then the manner of his death, Diu. Attend it time growes short all feare is past. The Diuill bringeth from the doore Lucreciaes Ghost, and after her the ghost of Candie stabbed. Alex. What meanes that ghastly shadow which came first? Diuil. By that which represents Lucretia, Leprous and poisoned is thy death declar'd, By poyson which now struggleth with thy spirits, And by that other which sets out to thee, The murther of thy sonne the Duke of Candy, Prefigur'd is the death of thy sonne Cæsar, Thou for the poysoning of thy daughter poysoned: He for the murthering of his brother murthered. Alex. Thus God is onely iust. Diu. The Diuill cannot deny it. Alex. Man onely false. Learne miserable wretched mortall men, By this example of a sinfull soule, What are the fruites of pride and Auarice, Of cruell Empire and impietie, Of prophanation and Apostacie, Of brutish lust falsehood, and perfidie, Of deepe dissembling and hypocrisie, Learne wicked worldlings, learne, learne, learne by me To saue your soules, though I condemned be. Sound a Horne within, enter a Diuill like a Poast. 1 Diu. Here comes a fatall message, I must hence. Exit. Alex. My roabes, my roabes; he robs me of my roabes, Bring me my roabes, or take away my life, My roabes, my life, my soule and all is gone. Alexander falleth in an extasie vpon the ground. 2. Diuil. From the pale horror of eternall fire, Am I sent with the wagon of blacke Dis, To guide thy spirit to the gates of death, Therefore I summon thee to come with speed, For horrizons now stand thee not insteed. Alexander aduanceth a little. Alex. Horror and horror, feare ensueth feare, Torment with tormentes is Incompassed: Dispaire vpon dispaire, damnation Vpon damnation, hell and consience, Murther, lust, auarice impiety, Vaine prophanation and apostacie, Rage and distraction tiranize: away, Away proud Lucifer, away. Diuill. away, away. The Diuill windeh his horne in his eare and there more diuills enter with a noise incompassing him, Alexander starteth. Alex. Holla, holla, holla, come, come, come, what, when, where when, why, deaf, strike, dead, aliue, oh alas, oh alas, alwaies burning, alwayes freezing, alwayes liuing, tormented, neuer ending, neuer, neuer, neuer mending, out, out, out, out, why, why, whether, whether, thether. Diuills. Thether, thether, thether. Thunder and lightning with fearefull noise the diuells thrust him downe and goe Triumphing. Enter Cardinalls and Bentiuoli. Bent. What is he dead? Car. Dead, and in such a fashion, As much affrights my spirits to remember, Thunder and fearfull lightning at his death, Out cries of horror and extremity. Bent. Cause all your bells to ring my lords of Rome, Rome is redeemed from a wicked Pope. Car. God hath beheld vs with his eyes of mercy, His name be glorified, ioyne all in prayer, And giue him praise that tooke away your shame. Bent. Goe your procession, sing your letinies, And let your Churches through with multitudes, Banquets and bonfiers through the Citty make. In signe our Church is freed from infamy, Car. Euen as his spirit was inflate with pride, Behold his bodie puffed vp with poyson, His corps shall be conuaied to saint Peeters, Open for all beholders, that they may See the reward of sinne, amend and pray. Guicchiardine. Th'omnipotent great guider of all powers, (Whose essence is pure grace, and heauenly loue, As he with glorie crownes heroyick actions, Bearing a taste of his eternall vertue) So semblably doth he with terror strike, In heauie vengeance sinnes detestable: As in this tragike myrrour to your eyes, Our sceane did represent in Alexander, Flagicious Cæsar his ambicious sonne, Reseru'd for more calamities to come, After he was imprisoned by the Church, Escap't into the kingdome of Nauarre, Vnto King Iohn then brother to his wife: Where in an ambush at Viano slaine, Iust Nemesis repaide his treacherie.</field>
