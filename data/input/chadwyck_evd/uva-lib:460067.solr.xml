      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Invited by a Woman, every Guest, No doubt, expects a soft Effeminate Feast, Has set his Appetite for tender Strains Of Maids forsaken, or Despairing Swains; Tho' Sweden's Liberty is in debate, Concludes amidst the War, and Cares of State, Her Hero will not fail your Hearts to move With the dear Virtue of unbounded Love; But she by other means to please design'd, Nor wou'd those Passions sooth, to which all find Frail Nature of it self enough inclin'd: To publick Virtues she'd your Souls incite, A Woman thus may give you safe Delight; Her warmest Scenes will raise no dangerous Flame, A Northern Hero is her chosen Theam, Full of his Countries Fate, to all the Fair, Cold as his Climate, he'll unmov'd appear, Cold as at home the best bred Husband here. Thus liv'd Gustavus, but for him t'attone, Ladies to you a Patriot shall be shewn, In whose more tender Breast a virtuous Wife Rivals his Country, and divides his Life. Nor will she less we hope engage the Fair, Since Publick Good is now that Sexes Care; They must a Noble Heroine approve, Parting with Life, nay what we prize above, To save the Nation, vanquishing her Love. This Pattern may prevail to disingage All the Fair Politicians of the Age, From every Byass that our Feuds increase, Renouncing Private Ends, for Publick Peace. Nor can the vainest haughtiest Man, disdain A Woman's Precepts in Great ANNA's Reign; If by a Woman you to night are taught, Think on that Source from whence th'Instruction's brought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE Gustavus's Camp. Enter Erici, follow'd by a number of Peasants. Erici. What is it ye demand? Ingrateful Swedes! Have ye forgot the Sufferings, Toils, and Dangers, Through which, for you, the brave Gustavus struggled? Whilst tame and hopeless under your Oppressions, He only durst attempt to rouse your Courage, And led you on to Liberty and Conquest; Ev'n this Gustavus whom ye basely wou'd abandon. 1st Peas. We'll return to him when Harvest is over. 2d Peas. We must not let our Families starve for him. Erici. For him! Is it for him you're arm'd against the Danes? Were not your Wives, your Children, your own Lives, At stake? Ye might indeed have had Permission To labour each revolving Season, to bear The Toil of Harvest, whilst the Danes enjoy'd The Fruits; What use of them had ye, unless To pay the Purchase of your Slavery? Are the Oppressions we all groan beneath, So light, or of so long a Date, to scape remembrance? Oh my Countrymen they still are fresh! And nothing but th'increase of Miseries Each day brought with it, cou'd make the past forgot: Look back on all the Cruelties we've born Since that unhappy day, when (by the Death Of our Administrator, slain at the Head Of his Victorious Army) th'invading Danes Gave the first Blow to Sweden's Liberty; Gustavus then a Prisoner in Denmark, By Treachery secur'd, none durst oppose Th'Usurper's growing Pow'r, all Swede submitted On Conditions which the Faithless King No sooner made than broke, regarding neither Treaties, Law, or Justice: But oh remember That bloody Massacre which solemniz'd His Coronation Feast! The Reverend Senate, And every worthy Citizen of Stockholm, Butcher'd by the inhuman King's command; That horrid Scene of Murders, Rapes and Rapine, The Prelude to unparallell'd Barbarities Committed daily since in every Province! These are the Tyrannies, Gustavus arm'd ye To avenge, and free your suffering Country: But if ye'd still be Slaves. 1st Peas. No, no, we're for Liberty. All Peas. Liberty, Liberty. Erici. Pursue your Conquests then, Your Enemies are few and cannot scape ye, Unless by your own treacherous Desertion. Speak ye Dalecarlians, ye whose Mountains first Gave shelter to Gustavus, when scap'd from Prison, To ye he first reveal'd himself, and animated By his Courage and noble Resolution, Ye gave the heartless Nation first Example To hope and make a Generous Attempt For Liberty; and will ye now desert Your glorious Cause, deceive your General's Trust, And leave him to the Mercy of the Danes? A Dalec. We'll rather Dye than forsake him. All Dalec. We'll Dye for Liberty and Gustavus. All Peas. Down with the Tyrant, Down with the Bloody Danes, Long live Gustavus our brave Deliverer. Enter Gustavus attended. Gust. Thanks to my Countrymen, Heav'n grant me Life Till your entire Deliverance ratifie That happy Title; I fear'd some Mutiny Lieutenant, the Peasants oft repeated Acclamations Alarm'd me hither, to enquire the Cause Of this disorder'd Concourse. Erici. My Lord, the Peasants were importunate To be dismiss'd, that they might take the Care Of Harvest, each in their several Provinces. Gust. And why, Erici, was not their Request, E'er now, brought to my hearing? Erici. Because, my Lord, I thought it a Request As much unfit for you to hear, as grant. Gust. Unfit, Erici, wherefore is't unfit, That these who give their voluntary Service To the common Cause, shou'd be allow'd Their Share in Nature's Bounty, th'Advantage of The Season she allots to store her yearly Product, Ev'n needful to our Being? Can we cut off this common Privilege? Deprive 'em of their Right, to make provision For the Support of Life, their own, their Wives, And Families? What cou'd the Danes do more Tyrannick? Far be it from Gustavus To forbid their Pious PurposeâGo, My Friends, I here discharge ye till the end Of Harvest, then as ye prize your Country, Laws, And Liberty, return to their Defence. 1st Peas. We will not fail, my Lord, Heav'n bless your Goodness. 2d Peas. We'll bring the whole Country with us to serve you. Gust. Ye do not all depart? A Dalec. No, my good Lord, Six hundred stout Dalecarlians we ingage To guard you, who resolve to run your Fortune, And never will forsake you. Gust. 'Tis sufficient. Well do my brave Dalecarlians justifie My Confidence in them, I've put my Life E'er this into your Hands, and from my Safety And Success, found first in your Protection, I take the Omen of our future Fortune. Petri, give out my Orders to discharge The Peasants, all save my own Troops of Horse, And the six hundred resolute Dalecarlians, They are reserv'd for my Security, And the Defence of Upsal; see the rest dismiss'd. 1st Peas. Heav'n preserve your Lordship. (All) Long Live Gustavus. Exit Pedri with Peasants shouting Gust. A sullen Cloud hangs on the Brow, Erici, That tells me thou'rt displeas'd with what I've done. Erici. No, I am only angry with my self, For being more concern'd than you would have me, In what regards your Safety; you've chid me oft For loving you too well, and I was trying To correct that Fault. Gust. Not for thy Love, 'Tis that (next to the Zeal thou bear'st thy Country) Endears thee to me, but I cou'd wish thee Less officious, more considerate in thy Service, Some rash Effects of an untemper'd Zeal I have condemn'd, but ever priz'd the honest Plain Sincerity of thy well-meaning Heart. Erici. May you have never cause to wish you'd not rejected The officious Service, I had now design'd you; Never may you repent, or we deplore The negligence you shew of your own safety. Gust. You tax me wrongfully. Were I neglectful of my Life or Safety Why sought I Refuge 'mong the Northern Mountains? Why in the Mines, disguis'd and labouring like The meanest Peasant, lay I so long conceal'd Deceiving my Persuers? No, Erici, When I expose my self to needless Dangers Whilst yet I may be useful to my Country, Whilst I can draw this Sword in its defence, Condemn me as a Traytor. Erici. Yet, my Lord, You have left your self unguarded, ev'n in view Of that important City, which contains The only Enemies you have to conquer. Gust. Erici, we Who fight for Justice, for the Laws, the Rights And Priviledges of our Nation, ought To be most careful that the means we use Be strictly just and pious as our Cause: Suppressing Tyranny's an ill pretect For our becoming Tyrants. Had it been just To have detain'd these Men, who not induc'd By mercenary Pay, no Obligation On them but their Wills, have follow'd me With chearful free Obedience, thro' all the Toils And Hazards of the War? To whom I owe Ev'n that Authority I shou'd have us'd Against 'em. Erici. But what avails their Labours, Hazards Or your Conquests, if in the full career Of your Successes, retreating e'er the course Is finish'd, they resign the Danes th'Advantage You had gain'd? Gust. Not so, Erici, We yet may reach the Goal e'er they retrieve Th'Advantage they have lost. The King of Denmark Grown hateful to his Subjects, by his Cruelty, Injustice and Oppressions, they've refus'd To grant him any Aid that may secure His Usurpation here; And by their Murmurings and Cabals, he'll find Himself too much embroil'd at Home, to think Of Foreign Conquests. Erici. Yet the Viceroy seems T'expect from thence a speedy Reinforcement; At least th'Archbishop endeavours by that Promise To retain the Swedes in their Subjection. Gust. Were that ambitious Prelate no more vigilant, Or powerful, than the Viceroy, we had no further Work; But by the Clergy's dependance upon him, And influence on the People, he alone Detains them from unanimously joining With us. Erici. Whilst the voluptuous Viceroy, shut up In Stockholm, e'er since he shamefully deserted An Army posted to so great advantage, Scarce knows of its defeat; forbidding any To disturb his Pleasures with ill News. As if he thought by keeping out Reports He cou'd prevent the progress of your Arms. Gust. Our selves perhaps e'er long may carry him The first and surest Tidings of his Ruin. Erici. I had such hopes, my Lord, when by approaching Stockholm, you seemd t'intend a speedy Siege, But see not now the means. Gust. Be satisfied, Erici, we shall have means: Count Arwide, with the Forces he commands, Are on their march to join us; and trust me I esteem His single Aid, worth numbers of the Peasants. Erici. 'Tis a brave Man, Who by his Diligence and Resolution In executing your Designs and Orders, Has done such noble Service to his Country, As merits much acknowledgment from both. Gust. Count Arwide owes no part of my Affection To my acknowledgment; a Soul so great, So generous, so just, so firm to Virtue, VVith all that native mildness and render disposition, Needs not th'addition of his Services T'impress a Friendship most indelible. Enter a Soldier. Sol. My Lord, the Canons lately come from Upsal Wait your Commands, intending instantly To enter Stockstolm, if they have your permission. Gust. Most willingly, they have my full instructions, These Canons have assur'd me, they've much influence On the Arch-bishop of Upsal, and hope t'engage him In our Int'rests. Erici. What need my Lord to court that Arrogant, Ambitious Prelate, now when the desp'rate Fortune Of his Party, and your encreasing Glory, Assures our Countries Liberty without him? Gust. Yet may we purchase it at the expence Of many Lives, which I wou'd save on any Composition; nor wou'd destroy one Enemy Whom I cou'd make a Friend; a Victory More noble far, than the most glorious Battle. Erici. Excellant Man! Your Virtue ever thus Constrains me to admire, what my ignobler Thoughts condemn'd. Gust. No Flattery, Erici, thy kind Reproofs Speaks better thy Affection. Merit I praise For that my Thoughts are Human, for that I am a Man? Enter Christina and Laura in Man's Cloaths. Chris. Hither I was directed to the General: This I presume is the renown'd Gustavus. Gust. Wou'd you ought with me? Chris. My Lord, a most unhappy Youth, cast off By all his Family, whom Fear, or Avarice Engages to the Tyrants Interest, Is for the honest Love he bears his Country, Forc'd to implore your generous Protection; Which I more hope for from your native Goodness, Than the recommendation of this Letter; Gust. Christina! Believe me, lovely Youth, thou cou'd'st not come In any Name wou'd more assure thy Welcome. I joyfully receive you, young Fredage, After Reading the Letter. (For so Christina calls you) and do account it; To what before I ow'd that generous Lady, That she entrusts her Nephew to my Ear. Receive this Youth, Erici, as related And dear to Fair Christina, That Lady thou ha'st heard of, who when her Husband Intended to betray me to the Danes, Inform'd me of it, aided my Escape, And found me a more faithful Sanctuary. Erici. All Sweden's Debtor to her for Gustavus; And as my Services to this sweet Youth, May speak my part of our acknowledgment, None shall be more assiduously grateful. Chris. Accept my Thanks, in the Unfortunate Christina's Name. Gust. Unfortunate! Ye Pow'rs! exempt Christina's Life (amidst The general Miseries) from all Misfortune. Chris. Alas, my Lord, she suffers a large share; Scarce had you gain'd the Refuge she assign'd you, When Beron, her ambitious, faithless Husband, Return'd with a strong Party of the Danes; But when he miss'd the Prey he thought secure, Transported with the Rage of disappointed Avarice and Ambition, and in the Thought His Wife had been Confederate to your Flight, He vow'd she publickly shou'd suffer Death, The Penalty denounc'd on all who shou'd Conceal Gustavus; dreading this fatal Vengeance, With difficulty she escap'd his Pow'r, To seek with her Relations some Retreat Conceal'd from all your Enemies and Hers. From which unknown Abode she sent this Letter, To recommend a Youth to your Protection, Almost the only of his Family, Who does not wish your Ruin. Gust. Alas, Fredage, it wounds my Soul with Sorrow, To find I've caus'd my generous Preserver So much Unhappiness. But art thou sure She's safe from Beron's Pow'r? Chris. Some search he made, But having giv'n the Viceroy Information Of your Design against him, he was soon Sent for to Court; where by his subtlety And natural Insinuation, he Int'rely gain'd the Viceroy's Favour; Who supinely trusting to his Faith and Conduct Indulges freely to his lawless Pleasures, In which his Favourite no less assists, Than he relieves him from the publick Cares. Gust. We shortly shall disturb his ill-tim'd Pleasures. Then if our hopes succeed, Christina shall Be safe from all her Fearsâmean while, Fredage, You are my welcome Charge. When you'd retire Be pleas'd to use my Tent, till I give Orders For your Accommodation in the Village, Whether I am now going on Affairs That will not long detain me.âYou must with me, Erici, To Constantia, she may have later News Than ours from Count Arwide her Noble Lord, Which it were fit to learn e're we dispose Of the small Army left us, or determine On Levying new Forces. Erici. What Fund have we, my Lord, for the expence Of raising any Force considerable? Gust. My Patrimonial Fortune, upon which My Ancestors so long maintain'd their Grandeur, Shall more magnificently be expended Now, in the publick Cause, for Liberty, If we prevail. My grateful Country will not let me starve; If not, I've learnt in the Dabecarlian Mines To Labour for my Bread; But, Oh! thou Pow'r Supream, If our return to Slavery is decreed, Ex. Gust. Erici, and Attend. Grant that my Death my Countries Fate preceed. Chris. When I behold this Vertuous Lord, consider him As our Deliverer, whose glorious Name Posterity will Bless, I feel a secret Joy for having been The destin'd Author of his Preservation: But when I view my self, driv'n like a Vagabond About the World, flying a Husbands Cruelty; A Wretch deny'd a Refuge by her nearest Friends, Wandring in a disguise that ill becomes Her Sex, to beg Protection from a Stranger; But most, Oh Laura, when I think how all May be interpreted to my dishonour I must lament my Fate! Was there no means but this? Why was I pointed out the Instrument? Had Sweden been less happy in Gustavus, If I had not been wretched for his Safety? Lau. Your Sufferings, Madam, are your greatest Glory; Yet rather turn your Thoughts on your miraculous Escape from Dangers, with which th'o'erruling Pow'r Has Seal'd the Approbation of your Actions; Enervating the Furious, and deceiving The Subtlest of your Enemies: How happily Your Brother-in-Law believ'd your Journey was, Intended too to your Husband, who he knew Was fix'd at Court. Chris. Alas, I hop'd to find An honourable Refuge with a dear Sister, But, to our Misfortune, we're united To two Brothers, not more ally'd by Blood Than Temper, both Ambitious, Treacherous, And Cunning. Lau. Yet you averted his Suspicions, And were, I think, encharged with Letters from him To his Brother. Chris. Flatter'd by his Ambition, He hastily laid hold on this occasion, Of recommending, by my Husband's Int'rest, His Son into the Viceroy's Service, who being At a College on my way, he beg'd I'd take with me, in order to present him; Warn'd by my Sister, I receiv'd his Charge, And then resolv'd on this Disguise, lest he, Advertis'd of my Flight, should soon pursue me. Lau. Bless'd be that Providence that intercepted The Notice, which no doubt Beron wou'd send him Of your absence. Chris. Yes, Laura, 'tis permitted me, T'ascribe my Safety to the Care of Heav'n, Since I've not involv'd my self in danger, By ought that cou'd offend the awful Pow'r; There's all the Consolation of my Sufferings, That their Cause is truly noble, such As, wer't again in my Election, I'd Repeat, ev'n now assur'd of all the Miseries I feel, or that which more than all I dread, The blasting Censures of malicious Tongues; Which our best Actions draw too oft against us. A hard Condition; And, Oh, how rare that solid Virtue which Alone can stand so dangerous a Tryal? Many preserve their Virtue for a Name, But few for Virtue, wou'd abandon Fame. [Exeunt. The Scene changes to the Viceroy's Palace. The Viceroy sitting, Beron standing by him, Musick plays a while, then the Viceroy rising, speaks. Viceroy. No more, the soothing Notes indulge my Spleen, And add to the Disquiets of my Soul, A Sense of Sadness not deriv'd from thence, Rais'd only in this weak disturb'd Machine. Ber. What can be done to cure, if ev'n your Pleasures Add to your Disquiet? Vice. Our feeble Frame, unable to support Uninterrupted Sadness, or delight, Alike oppress'd by both, Sinks under the Completion of our Wishes, And seeks Relief from Pleasure in disgust, Sated with all my Appetite can ask, nay ev'n in the height Of my Felicity, in spight of all Thy Cares, my faithful Beron; This young Gustavus, This victorious Rebel, come cross my Thoughts, Checks my Delights, and leaves me now no other Sense of Greatness, but as a painful Burden Ready to crush me, sinking with its weight. Enter a Servant. Serv. Th'Archbishop of Upsal attends your Excellence. Viceroy. Ha! my other Plague; But he's a necessary one, admit him. [Ex. Serv. The Pride of this imperious Swede (who slights His Equals, hates all that's superior) were insupportable, Did not his Pow'r make him needful to us; Yet I cou'd spare his presence, that turbulent And restless Spirit entertains me ever On some distastful Theme of Disappointments, Sieges, Battles lost, and Towns surrender'd. Enter the Archbishop. Arch. I fear'd to interrupt your Excellence In some more grateful Entertainment Than a Discourse of War, of Towns surrender'd. Vice. Whatever were the Subject, Your Grace's Interruption must be to an Advantage. Arch. I wish, my Lord, such Subjects were less seasonable, That we might dream away our thoughtless Lives, Or drown our Cares in Luxury securely; But 'tis not so, my Lord, Gustavus will not Sleep, or trifle time away in complaisance To our repose, nor Armies wait the close Of a fine Consort, or elegant Repast, To know if we're at leisure to oppose 'em. Vice. I hope your Grace intends not to reproach me, If I with short Delights relieve my mind Oppress'd with Cares; The publick Business has Not been neglected. Arch. No more of that, my Lord, the past forgot, 'Tis only of Importance to look forward, and with Care united, Take all Precautions for our own Defence; The murmuring City seems irresolute T'indure a Siege. Beron. My Lord, 'tis sure the Rebels have no Fleet; And whilst we're Masters of the Sea, our Strength Can never be exhausted; from every part Of the vast Globe, our Wants may be supply'd; And what Recruits the King at any time Shall send, securely may arrive into the Port, And, without Opposition, be admitted. Arch. 'Tis granted, Beron, yet the long delay Of our expected Reinforcement, discourages The People, scarce are they now restrain'd By our Authority, from yielding up their Gates Unsummon'd, e'er the Siege is yet begun. Loudly they praise Gustavus, talk of his Moderation, Justice, and Piety, yet when the Clergy Exclaim against him as an Excommunicate, Declare, that all who favour him are Rebels To the Holy See, their Zeal and Reverence Of the Spiritual Pow'r, awes 'em to silence, And inflames their Courage to defend it: This is our strongest Hold, which vigorously Must be maintain'd. Viceroy. 'Tis to your Grace's Vigilance and Credit, We still must owe the Peoples firm Perswasion, That Religion is our Cause, that useful Politick, Which serv'd so well our Vengeance, and Ambition, Is necessary to our Safety now. Beron. Nor can it fail to gull The Superstitious Multitude, mov'd only With the Name and Outside of Religion; Be the Design but gilded o'er with that Pretence, the glittering delusive Colour Reflects a Brightness on the blackest Actions, And darkens, on the side that's opposite, The most illustrious Virtues. Arch. That I have not Been wanting on my part to the King's Interests, I need not tell you, wou'd he had less depended On my Pow'r, or been less Dilatory To assist it; The Pastors may retain Their Flock in some Subjection, But can our Rhetorick disarm Gustavus? Can we perswade the Rebels to be conquer'd, Or Preach 'em from our Gates? Enter a Servant. Serv. My Lord, two Canons just arriv'd from Upsal, Being known to the Archbishop, desire admittance To your Excellence, while his Grace is present. Arch. From Upsal? my Lord, with your PermissionâLet 'em Enter. Welcome, my Friends: These reverend Canons have [To the Vice. Been faithful to us, and deserve your Favour. Ent. 2 Can. they kneel to the Arch. who presents them to the Vice. Vic. They need not doubt of it, so recommended. Has ought that I can serve you in, brought you from Upsal? 2 Can. We'ad no intent in leaving it, but of Arch. and 1st Canon talk apart. Retreating to our Primate, from a City Declar'd for his, and the King's Enemies. Arch. A Passport from Gustavus! Did he fear Your Pow'r in the Diocess? or hope, With fawning Arts, to gain you to his Party? 1st Can. The Obligation we have to Gustavus, Is not peculiar, or to be mention'd With those unpresidented Instances Of Generosity and Moderation Which all are Objects of, where he has Pow'r, Whoe'er had seen him when he enter'd Upsal, Not suffering the meanest to be injur'd, Had rather ta'en him for your Substitute, The Peoples common Parent, the Guardian, than The Conqueror of the City. Arch. Ha! Are you sent to be his Panegyrist? Is not Rebellion too among his Virtues? Must not that be display'd to court my Favour, And move my Emulation? 1st Can. My Lord, 'tis not, I think, forbid to do a Rebel justice, But for his Cause, let his own Letter speak, Which with Submission he presents, entreating Gives the Archb. a Letter. You'd coolly and impartially peruse it. Arch. What does the Boy pretend, to School me from my purpose, Or Flatter me to his? After Reading.] No, I am to be Brib'd it seemsâYe Traytors! Thus do you pay Allegiance to your King, And render that Respect ye owe to me? Viceroy. What is't transports your Grace? Arch. Be judge, my Lord, I'll have no secret Treaty with Gustavus, Th'audacious Boy wou'd tempt me to his Party With a Bribe; Upsal is offer'd, All my Estate untouch'd, Submission, and Obedience to my Councils; The fawning Sycophant! I may command his Army too: It seems This formidable Victor needs my Authority, To confirm his new precarious Pow'r. Shallow Politician! Viceroy. This humble Stile Shews he is weaker than our Fears imagin'd; None court an Enemy they hope to vanquish. 2d Can. Some few there are, whose generous Dispositions Incline 'em most to Peace, when most secure Of Victory in War; some Spirits fram'd To Mercy, who account their Enemies Destruction, the most unhappy Triumph Of their Fortune; nor take that last recourse Of slighted Friendship, but with regret, and on Necessity. Arch. Such, you'd insinuate, Is your Gustavus; for ye are both confederate In this Treason. My Reverend Ambassadors, Hence to your Rebel Master, hence and tell him, If he's for Bribing me effectually, It must be with his Head, that's the sole grateful Offer he can make me; nor have I other Counsel for him, or Command to his Plebian Subjects. 2d Can. My Lord, It grieves me. Arch. I know it does, to have so ill succeeded; You had been pleas'd, wou'd I have been the Scaffold For Gustavus t'erect his Greatness on; To be thrown down when he no longer needed My Support. But did you hope it? No, Ye know my Soul's abhorrent to the Man, More than his Cause; this was but your Pretence, Ye're sent for Spies, or to betray the City; My Lord, let 'em be seiz'd and executed instantly, As Spies and Traytors. Vice. Beron, call my Guards. Ber. Permit me first to speak my cooler Thoughts, Your Grace's EarâMy Lords, 'tis to be fear'd, Shou'd ye proceed with Violence 'gainst these Ecclesiasticks, the Body of the Clergy [Canons talk apart. Wou'd resent it as their common Cause; And to offend them now, who are the sole Supporters of our Party, were most Unpolitick. 1st Can. We must resolve on this, or we are lost. 2d Can. There's no deliberating in such an Exigence, Be quick and resolute, I'll second you. Arch. I wou'd not be suspected of holding Correspondence With the Rebels, they must not thus escape. 1st Can. My Lords, wou'd your Resentment permit us A short Audience, ye soon wou'd be convinc'd We are no Traytors, but faithful to your Interests. 2d Can. What can we offer in Excuse for bringing This presumptuous Letter from Gustavus? 1st Can. That had we not accepted it, we cou'd Not have had means to give the Viceroy notice O'th'sudden turn, and weakness of your Enemy's Condition. Arch. Ha! the sound is grateful to me, Confirm it, give it proof, and be restor'd To my most dear Affection. 2d Can. 'Tis not for us, whose Lives are in your Hands, To sooth you with a Falsehood; so be we safe, As is Gustavus, forsaken by his Army. Vice. Is't possible! 1st Can. My Lord, most certain Truth, The Peasants wou'd not be detain'd from Harvest, Scarce are Five hundred left to guard his Person. Vice. My Blessing on them for it, we yet may breath In Freedom then, spight of his threat'ned Siege. Arch. Is that sufficient? Gustavus breaths the Air With equal Freedom. Give me, my Lord, what Forces You can spare, my self will, at their Head, Give this Dissembler answer to his Offers; I'd trust no other Chief against Gustavus, My Hate's alone superior to his Fortune. Vice. Four thousand Danes, the greatest part and Flow'r o'th'Garrison, Shall be drawn out, and order'd to obey you. Arch. With speed and secresie, we must surprize him E'er he's warn'd to 'scape us; now, now, my Lord, Your Feasts, your Mirth and Harmony, will all be seasonable; Exert your Art against our glad Return, to celebrate Our Victory, assur'd this dreaded Hero In Chains, shall wait the Triumphs of this Night, Or once more to the Mountains take his Flight. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE A Forrest. Enter Gustavus, Erici, Fredage, Laura, two Swedish Gentlemen, and Attendants. Gust. That we have 'scap'd so imminent a Danger, Gain'd with so little loss, tho' close pursu'd, The favourable Covert of this Forrest, First let us bow to Heav'n in humble Thanks; Next, my brave Friends, the worthy Instruments Of Providence to save us: Be yours the Praise, And glad Acknowledgment, of every Swede, Who to your timely Notice of the Archbishop's Purpose, ows his Life. Gent. My Noble Lord, All who are present know, the Soldiers owe Their safe Retreat to your sole Valour, each Aiming only to secure himself; Whilst you almost almost alone sustain'd the Fury Of the Enemy: Exposing for, The fearful Herd, a Life more worth than the whole Flock. 2 Gent. Yet may we claim the Glory of their Safety, Since all had been inevitably lost, Had not our Diligence warn'd and preserv'd Their valiant General for their Defence. Erici. 'Twas fortunate, indeed, to have such Friends So near, and unsuspected, to the Viceroy; Else, my Lord, your trusty stout Dalecarlians Wou'd have but ill secur'd you; soon as you left The Village, when yet you scarce had joyn'd your Men, Th'Archbishop enter'd it with all his Forces; And follow'd at our Heels. Gust. Confess, Erici, Since we're now secure, do'st thou not feel A sullen spightful Joy, for that we've been Endanger'd, and prov'd thy Fears Prophetick. Erici. In truth, my Lord, I shall not much deny it, Nor you, I hope, that you have in some Moments Repented of rejecting my Advice. Gust. I never shall repent of being Just, Or judge my Actions by th'uncertain Rule Of their Event. How is't my lovely Charge? [To Fredage. Thou'st been but ill encourag'd to the War, By this Essay; thy Fear had almost lost thee; Scarce had it left thee Pow'er t'avoid the Danger Which had rais'd it. Fred. Methought, my Lord, I ran As valiantly as any of your Heroes, Who had all the Prudence to retire, not hazarding a Blow. Enter a Soldier. Sold. Collonel de Sassi greets my Lord Gustavus, And with Twelve hundred Germans, is arriv'd Within a quarter of an Hours slow March, From the South entrance of the Forrest. Gust. They're welcome; Wou'd they had been arriv'd some few Hours since, We had not turn'd our Backs upon the Danes, But found 'em nobler WorkâNay then 'tis not Too late, my noble Friend, Count Arwide too, [Enter Count Arwide. Without a Warning come t'increase my JoyâBy the Surprize. Arw. No Messenger so swift, Whose tardy haste wou'd not have lag'd behind, And been prevented by my eager Love; Oh how it joys my Soul, to see you safe After th'Alarm I have had of your late Danger, I durst not trust Reports, but left my Forces 'Twixt this and Stockholm, where you order'd me To joyn you; Yet am I well accompany'd: Many brave Swedes Alarm'd and Fearing for Your Safety, met me on the Way, and flock To your Assistance. Gust. They're Friends indeed to seek me in Distress, In my low Ebb of Fortune; nor shall we want Employment for their Love: In a most happy Hour are you come to turn our past Misfortune To much Advantage, and retaliate double On the Foe, the Mischief they design'd us. Arw. How how my Lord? Command your faithful Soldier, Who knows but to obey you. Gust. We're inform'd Th'Arch-Bishop purpos'd to return directly Back to Stockholm. This Gentleman we Credit On your Intelligence. Gent. My Lord I dare Assure you he's engag'd to bring the Garrison E'er Night into the City, whether you scap'd By Flight, or fell into his Pow'r; as with Proud boasting he promis'd to the Viceroy. Gust. Triumphing in our Flight, the haughty Prelate No doubt will March secure and confident Not fearing any Enemy so near Who dare encounter him; E'er this he's on His way, yet may our diligence prevent him. You, Arwide, by the shortest Passage, haste To joyn your Troops, they're posted to advantage, And may with ease retire into the Woods That lie betwixt the Arch-Bishop and the City, Who cannot fail to fall into the Ambush; My self, with the Dalecarlians, and what Supplies Are newly brought me, will observe his motion, And follow him at a convenient distance To fall upon the Rear, and cut off their Retreat. Our time is precious, hast my gallant Friend. Arw. Doubt not, your Orders shall be executed With utmost expedition, and our next Meeting be With double Joy of Friends and Conquerors. Exit Count Arwides Gust. Come my brave Countrymen, each to retrieve This Days disgrace, exert himselfâBut thou Supream Disposer of Events, on Thee we must depend, Confessing Humane Prudence all but vain. Unblest by thy implor'd o'erruling Pow'r; Oh aid the juster side that in the happy Consequence of this Days danger, all May adore the Wonders of thy Wisdom! Exeunt omnes; manet Fredage. Fre. My trembling Heart forebodes I know not what of Terror in this hopeful Expedition; Why do I dread what will enflame The meanest Soldiers Courage? Are our Souls too Like their frail Mansions of weaker frame than Mans? Or can the force of Custom and Opinion Effect this difference? 'Tis so, the Hero Who undaunted, faces Death midst Cannons, Swords and Javelins, sinks under the less Honourable Dangers of Pain, Disease, Or Poverty, below a Womans weakness: And we whom Custom bars this active Valour, Branding it with Reproach, shrink at th'Alarm Of War, but where our Honour's plac'd, we oft Have shewn in its Defence a no less Manly daring. Yet Death is still the same in every Form, And every where my Friend, I'll try to Face him in The dreadfull'st Pomp and Horrors of the Battle. [Exit. The Scene changes to the Entrance of a Wood. Enter The Arch-Bishop, Beron, Officers and Soldiers, with Constantia and Maria Prisoners. Arch. We, whilst our Infantry advance, will keep A slower Pace; These Woods invite us to a short Refreshment Beneath their pleasing Shades; I think we need Not fear the irresistable Gustavus Shou'd disturb us. Ber. No, my Lord, unless He in his fright mistook the way and ran Into these Woods for shelter. Arch. Yes, Beron, He can run, the desp'rate Youth who for a while Brav'd my whole Army, thought fit at last to turn His Back, and fled as nimbly as the rest; Oh that pernicious Forrest that stop'd my Course Secur'd him from my Vengeance and his impending Fate! Beron. Your Grace has gain'd sufficient Glory from This Days success, to hearten our disponding Party, and damp the boldest Rebels hopes; Their General's flight and the Renown'd Count Arwide's Beauteous Wife your Pris'ner, are advantages That bound not in themselves, but guide the view To a large Prospect of Consequences, Far beyond, and of most high importance. Arch. For this we are indebted to thy Prudence, So shall the Viceroy know, that by thy happy Foresight and Advice we seiz'd this noblest Treasure Left by Gustavus with inadvertant Fear, In the Deserted Village, an unguarded Prey. Const. A worthy boast! That with deep Consultation Four Thousand Valiant Soldiers have secur'd A weak defenceless Woman. Arch. 'Tis Glorious Vengeance! Already I behold the lost Gustavus, Sullen, and gnawing on his Discontents; Then Furious, raging at the curst disgrace, Thus to be driv'n by his Mortal Foe! But when forsaken by his dearest Friend, Count Arwide to preserve this valu'd Hostage Forc'd to desert his weaken'd Party. How will he then Exclaim on Fates Injustice! The Treachery of Men, And Curse his rash attempt. Const. The Sacred Pow'r forbid That my poor Country be for my Redemption, Depriv'd of the least Aid against our Tyrants. Oh rather let me fall a Sacrifice To their Inhuman Vengeance! Arch. To our Justice, For 'tis of Right to punish lawless Rebels In their Alliance and curst Progeny. But Interest of State, may bate of right, And grant your Life to awe a powerful Rebel. Const. Wisely that branded Name has been apply'd, For a pretence to such Barbarities, As else must have bare Fac'd confess'd themselves, In their most horrid Form. Is it Rebellion for a wretched People Oppress'd and Ruin'd, by that Power they gave For their Defence, the safety of their Rights, To seek Redress? When Kings who are in Trust The Guardians of the Laws, the publick Peace and Welfare, Confess no Law but Arbitrary Will, Or know no use of Pow'r but to Oppress, And Injure, with Impunity, themselves Disown their Office, tacitly acquit The People, of whose due Obedience, just Protection, is the Natural and Essential Condition. Arch. Excellent Maxims, to perpetuate Confusion! Pernicious Principles! Which ev'n those Whose turn they serve against the Reigning Prince, Gladly disclaim when their own Pow'rs establish'd, Then wou'd they be obey'd as Heav'ns Vicegerents, Accountable to none but him they represent. Const. Wou'd Princes govern as if they themselves Believ'd they were accountable to Heav'n, There had been no occasion to contest Whether their Pow'r be of Divine, or Humane Institution; But when such impious Cruelties Are practis'd, as our Sweden long has been The Scene of (under this too justly stil'd The Northern Nero) strong necessity, Becomes the Peoples Casuist, proves that Piety And Justice must allow that self-defence, to which Nature so universally incites. Arch. Nature indeed, for Mutiny, a Love Of Novelty, and Spirit of Rebellion, Are Nature in the giddy Multitude; Humour and headstrong Will their Casuist, Unknowing of that specious Sophistry, With which their Factious Leaders gild their Cause. Not the Kings Cruelty, but too Imprudent Partial Clemency, gave Rise to this Revolt; Had he not spar'd the Sons of those his Justice doom'd, Had Young Gustavus, when his Pris'ner, shar'd His Fathers Fate, the King had Reign'd securely, And Sweden been in Peace. Const. Most true, My Lord, The Tyrant shou'd have spar'd no generous Swede, Whom breach of publick Faith, the Law of Nations, And Murther of so many Innocents, Cou'd prompt; or to Redress, or to Avenge Their Countries Wrongs.âBut can you thus insulting, Or without Terror, name those noble Victims Whose Blood still cries for Vengeance! They, My Lord, Were sure no Rebels, relying on the Faith Of Treaties; Solemn Oaths, and the smooth Face of Peace, Secure they went as to a Friendly Feast, The Band of Union; but with barbarous Treachery, Themselves were made th'inhumane Banquet, To glut the Luxury of sanctify'd Revenge, And Cruelty. Arch. No, Rebels! Dare you vindicate those Wretches Accurst, with sacred, solemn Excommunication. Was not the Cause of Piety concern'd, The Int'rest of our Holy Faith engag'd, T'expel such Poys'nous Vipers from the Earth? Const. The Cause of Piety! Can that Religion Of which the Spirit, and distinctive Character Is Mercy; forgiving Injuries and Universal Love, Can it e'er authorize Revenge? Incite To Persecution, and Bloody Massacres? Well may Infidels be scandaliz'd At our most Holy Faith, when its Professors Themselves impute to it the most unnatural Impieties? VVell may Religions sacred Name Be fall'n to Contempt, when thus abus'd, To serve the vilest, the most impious Ends! Arch. Is it for you To judge of your Superiors, t'instruct your Guide? When Women preach, 'twill be with Luther's Aid; A blessed Reformation. Const. Not to instruct, my Lord, but to awake; You've shut your Eyes against our present Miseries And future Dangers, else wou'd you not oppose Your Countries Liberty, or give pretext To Luther's growing Schism, which (with its fatal Consequences) will all be set to the Account of those Ambitious Church-Men, who've turn'd The Spiritual Pow'r, to Secular Tyrannical Dominion, and giv'n Libertines occasion In detecting the Usurp'd, to throw off Undistinguish'd, the just Authority. Arch. Insolent Assertions! Such are th'Insinuations which support Your PartyâBut we shall quell these impious ReformersâBeron, lead on your Pris'ner, We shall try if Sweden's great Deliverer Can save himself. [Going, a Soldier enters hastily. Sold. O haste, my Lord! Your Grace's presence Is necessary to re-assure your Men, Who in dismay. Arch. What! Do the Cowards fear A flying Enemy? Sold. An Ambush from The farther Woods, broke suddenly upon Our Infantry, shouting Count Arwide's Name; All struck with Terror, in disorder fly, Or fall without resistance. Const. My Lord arriv'd? Arch. In an unlucky Hour! Curse, Curse on Fortune, that with a random Throw, A Hit of Chance, defeats the wisest Purpose! Oh ConfusionâYou Beron, stay with these To guard Constantia; observe whilst we engage The Enemy, which way you, without Opposition, May gain the City; But on your Life secure her. Going, a Soldier enters at another Door. 2d Sold. My Lord, we are pursu'd, Gustavus with A num'rous Army, has set upon our Rear. Arch. Screech-Owl! Gustavus! this is then my way. Enter a third Soldier. 3d Sold. Where, where's his Grace? We're all lost Men, my Lord, your Army is surrounded, No possibility to 'scape is left us. Arch. Nay then their Victory will cost 'em dear, Valour exasperated by Despair, may prove. More fatal to the Victor, than the Vanquish'd. [Ex. Archb. Const. 'Tis Just, 'tis Just, to humble this proud Prelate; Can such Events as this be accidental, A Hit of blind unaiming Chance? Or is, What Men call Chance, the Hand of secret Providence, Guided by Springs unseen, to a determin'd End? It must be so, 'tis that o'er-ruling Wisdom Detain'd my Lord just to this pointed Hour, By ways so seeming opposite to compass The Tyrant's destin'd Ruin. Beron in dumb shew sends two Soldiers several ways. Enter Christina and Laura. Laur. This place is safe, the Entrance well defended By that close Covert we have pass'd, secures us. Chris. Art sure we're not pursu'd? Laur. Hark, a Noise, no, Wou'd we were farther from the reach of Danger. Chris. Our Fears wou'd still pursue usâThou may'st be Allow'd to fear Death might cut off thy Youth From many Blessings; But wherefore do I fly The sole Reliever of my Miseries? My Reason has adjudg'd Death eligible, Yet I fear himâ What is it thus divides us from our selves? What Composition this, that can desire What it most disapproves, and dread what it esteems? Ber. Ha! What are those? Be on your Guard, They must be Enemies. Two Youths unfollow'd, Seize 'em, we'll know, or disappoint their Purpose. Guards lay hold on Chris. and Laura. Chris. Ha! Whether are we fall'n? What means this Violence? Ber. What brings you hither from the general Battle? Chris. My Husband! Speak, speak to him, I dare not. Ber. Say, What are ye? Lau. Men of Peace, who not intending Hurt to either Party, withdraw from the Engagement: We're no Objects of your Enmity. Ber. That in plain Terms wou'd be, We're arrant Cowards, Howe'er ye seem of Note; And in Exchange, One Prisoner of Rank, will be accounted For many braver Men. Chris. Inevitably lost! Ber. Thou'rt soon return'd, What Tidings dost thou bring? Lau. Oh cruel Destiny! Chris. Oh that I'd perish'd One of the Guards sent by Ber. out, returns, they talk apart. In the Battle! My treacherous Fears have led me To a Fate, far, far more Terrible Than that from which they sav'd me! Now I cou'd Brave those Dangers, encounter any Enemy, But an incens'd, relentless, barbarous Husband. Ber. Desp'rate, say'st thou? Sold. Some few, encourag'd by his Grace, do yet Maintain a vigorous Defence against Gustavus, not in hope of Victory, They only sell their Lives at dearer Rates Than those who fell before 'em. Const. What of Count Arwide, Know'st thou ought of him? Sold. I mark'd him not, But just in entring the Wood, methought I heard confus'dly, the Soldiers shout his Name. Const. Alas I know not what their Shouts import, Perhaps his loss. Beron's 2d Messenger enters at another Door. Ber. Is thy Success no better? Or have we any Hope? Sold. Sir, you with ease May gain the City, there's not an Enemy This way t'oppose you. Ber. How! Is the Fortune of the Battle turn'd? Sold. All's lost, our Infantry intirely routed, Almost all cut off; some few who fled Towards Stockholm, Count Arwide suffer'd to escape, Hasting from their Pursuit to join Gustavus. Const. He yet is safe, Oh guard him, guard him ever. Ber. How may we pass unnotic'd? Sold. This side is clear, Nought to oppose your passage but heaps of Dead, We may securely bear our Pris'ners off. Ber. With Expedition thenâbe thou our Guide, You follow with the Youths, this Lady is my Charge. Let Arwide now account his Gains, with what He has lost, and yield our Prize th'Advantage. Const. You may be forc'd to quit your boasted Prize, Unless in mad Revenge you'll perish with it; Yes treacherous Swede, mark that I have foretold thee, Whate'er my Lord may suffer in Constantia, All that the Tyrant can on me impose, Will prove at last most fatal to our Foes. [Ex. led by Beron. Chris. Is there no Remedy? No Tygers to devour, No Earthquake, to involve me in undistinguish'd Ruins! No gentler Fate to save me from A Tyrant Husband's insulting Rage and Vengeance! Sold. Come, come along. Laur. Be moderate I conjure you, Your Passion will betray you. Chris. Oh 'tis impossible To be conceal'd from Beron, or to endure A Fate so strange as this with Moderation! I'll work it up to Madness, forgetting where, Or whose, or what I am, rush on insensible To all his Rigors, and disappoint the Triumph Of his Vengeance. [Exeunt omnes. Enter Gustavus and Arwide severally. Arw. The Victory's compleat, Not one of the fierce Danes who stood the Battle, But left his Life the Trophy of his Valour, And now our glorious Work is near accomplish'd, Through both the Gothlands all have yielded to us, All have confess'd the Justice of our Cause. Gust. The Progress of my gallant Friend's Success, Has been too swift for Fame. Arw. I've profited, my Lord, by your known Maxim, A Conqueror cannot buy the time he saves too dear. Gust. I'm yet to learn many Particulars Of your late Conquests, but too far have trespass'd After a tedious March, to have engag'd you On the most hard Fatigue of this days Action, And must oblige you now to your Repose. Arw. So near to my Constantia, can I find Repose elsewhere, or wish it but with her! Forgive your Soldier this confess'd Impatience, Not as a Woman, as a worthy Friend I seek Constantia, who with temperate Vertue, And unbyass'd Reason, confirms my Soul, Enforces my Esteem, and justifies My tenderest Affection. Gust. Fear not, my Friend, that I shall tax with Weakness Your Love for such an Object, who constrains The general Admiration, In all her Actions, all her Purposes, Appears a bent to Goodness, greatness of Mind, And a commanding Virtue; yet seems she not Insensible of the most tender Passions. Arw. Oh! she has all that Softness which endears And melts the Soul to transport: But superior Reason holds the Reins, guides and restrains Her most impetuous Wishes, nor suffers 'em To bound her to any indirect, unequal Path, From her determin'd Course. Gust. Such is her Excellence, it shames our Praise, Which has too long detain'd you from a Blessing Words cannot reach; nor is it less Injustice To Constantia, I then was with her when Th'Alarm was brought me, of th'Archbishop's Purpose To surprize us; and left her in the Village, Less anxious for her own than for our Safety; 'Twere cruel, longer to deprive her of Her share in Joy, for this days happy Fortune; Hast, my Friend, Constantia'll meet the News From you with double Welcome. Arw. Oh you are kind, thus to indulge my Fondness, Inciting me to what my Soul most eagerly Desires. Farewel, no other cause cou'd give me Joy, In parting with Gustavus. As Arw. is going, an Officer enters from the other side. Officer. A Trumpet from the Viceroy demands Admittance To the Lord Gustavus, and Count Arwide. Arw. To me? Gust. Conduct him inâ'Tis fit you stay, My Lord, to know the Purport of this Message. Enter Messenger. Mess. Thus to you both, victorious Lords, the Viceroy sends, 'Tis now his turn to take th'Advantage of His Fortune, since the same Chance of War which gave So many Danish Lives to yours, has put Into his Pow'r Constantia, Arwide's Lady. Arw. Ha! What say'st thou? Mess. She is, my Lord, a Pris'ner Now in Stockholm; her Liberty on this Condition offer'd, that you lay down your Arms, And give your self a Pris'ner in her stead; No other Ransom will the Viceroy take, Which if refus'd, her Death is doom'd to morrow. Arw. Inhumane Tyranny! Gust. Then thus return Our Answer to the ViceroyâIf he dares Execute his threatned barbarous Sentence, We vow Revenge by the immediate Death Of all the Danes who now are in our Pow'r; Nor think himself secure, e'er long we may Be Masters of his Fate; and be assur'd, Whate'er Constantia suffers, his Doom's the same, And all th'Adherents to his Party. Arw. Oh! What Attonement, what Satisfaction were The Lives of Thousands? We must not hazard thusâ Gust. Forbear, my Friend, by shewing your Concern, To give your Enemies yet more Advantage, 'Twill only urge their Cruelty, enhance The Ransom of their Prize, and more assure The Fate you fear. Arw. I must my self prevent it, Oh think not I can trustâ Gust. By all our Friendship I conjure you, restrain your Passion but A Moment; leave to my cooler Judgment, How to work on the mean-spirited Tim'rous Viceroy; nor interpose, I beg you: You know our Purpose, so bear it to your Master; Say I have vow'd, and at his Peril bid him Tempt our Vengeance. Mess. I shall, my Lord, and you will find the Viceroy Dares your utmost, expect that your next Tidings be, Constantia's dead. [Exit Messenger Arw. Oh fatal Sound! My Wife, my only Joy, in whom I'd fix'd The Recompence of all my Toils; And must I lose her thus? What's all my Fortune, all My Glory now?âIt cannot, shall not be, Whilst I have pow'r to save her. Gust. Fear not, my Friend, This Menace only shews the Viceroy wou'd Secure a Man he dreads: For his own Int'rest He'll preserve Constantia, whose Death wou'd but Deprive him of an Hostage, that will for ever Awe so dangerous an Enemy as Arwide. Arw. Oh we have long experienc'd the Danish Cruelty, Has the Ascendant of their Politicks, In every Instance of that Tyranny, By which they have provok'd their own Destruction; I dare not hazard on any Possibility, So dear, so irretrievable a Loss; Nor, if you wou'd not see your Arwide wretched, Disswade me from preserving her, whom, If I cou'd out-live; 'twere but to linger out A miserable Being, unbless'd with any Sense, or hope of Joy. Gust. These are the Sallies Of unbridled Passion; But recollect Your Vertue, remember you're devoted to The Publick, think on your glorious Cause, On what you owe your Country: Had I deserted it On Christiern's Summons, Had I laid down my Arms To save a Mother and a Sister's Life, How wou'd you have condemn'd me of Weakness and Injustice? Arw. You, who are the Head, the Soul of our Great Enterprize, shou'd own no private Tyes; I'm not of such Importance, nor can my Country exact more from me than I pay; I have not left her Service but with Life, Nor Life, 'till it was one with Misery, 'Till I no longer cou'd support it. Gust. What Privilege have you to be exempted From suffering your share o'th'common Miseries? Is't only in the Smiles of Fortunes, encourag'd With Success, and flush'd with Happiness, We owe our Country Service? What Traytor Wou'd not be a Patriot on such Terms? But if you truly prize your Countries Interest, Give not our Enemies an Hostage that more Effectually will bound my Pow'r, than all Their Opposition. Arw. Oh, I conjure you, consider not your Friend In any Competition with your Country; Have no regard for me, that may obstruct Your glorious EnterprizeâI know you will not. But is there room for a Deliberation, If I shou'd let Constantia perish, to live A miserable Wretch without her? Or, Only parting with an equal Blessing To lose with it, the Sense that I have lost it? My beating Heart alarms me to Constantia. One more Embrace. Gust. Oh Arwide, must I lose thee! Must the Tyrant Thus triumph o'er Gustavus? Arw. Oh Gustavus! Spare me th'Addition of thy racking Griefs; I cannot bear this Struggling in my Soul, I dare not listen to thee longer: And oh, Too long has my divided Tenderness Detain'd me, already may the murd'rous Steel Be pointed to her BreastâYet a few Minutes Heaven restrain their Cruelty! I fly To save my LoveâThen turn thy Care of me To Blessings on GustavusâI have no more to ask, But that my Death may be Constantia's Safety; And the last Instance the Danes may e'er have Pow'r To give my Country of their Tyranny. [Exit Arwide. Gust. They cannot give another so afflicting To me, or to thy Country! All my Success, The near Accomplishment of my best Hopes, Cannot bear up my Soul, o'erwhelm'd with Sadness At this fatal Loss: Alas, my Arwide, Our promis'd Aid from Lubeck, will, I fear, Arrive too late for thy Relief, On me The Tyrant will at last revenge his Ruin. Oh, cou'd the Pageantry of Pomp and Grandure, Exempt us from the Sense of private Ills, 'Twere worth the coveting;âBut no, my Soul, Thy utmost Expectation now must be, To see thy self a glorious Wretch, the certain Fate Of all, who're destin'd to support the publick Weight. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE The Viceroy's Palace. Enter Christina and Laura guarded. Officer. Here, Gentlemen, ye soon will know your Doom, Beron attends his other noble Pris'ner To the Viceroy, and commanded me to wait You hither, where he's order'd to present you: I'm now acquitted of my Charge, and must Withdraw till farther Orders. [Ex. Guard. Chris. Too well I know my Doom, know it inevitable! Now, Laura, What Pretence of Comfort can'st Thou find for such a Wretch? Lau. Oh Madam!âBut There's still a Possibility of Safety, Since yet you're undiscover'd to your Husband. Chris. Oh vain Imagination! Tho' undiscover'd In his disorder'd hast in 'scaping to the City, (Where, since he has not seen me) Oh what hope When now he comes, with artful and observing Care, To know and rate the Value of his Pris'ner? What possibility to 'scape a Husband's Knowledge, Or to avert the Vengeance of so cruel, So furious, so inflexible a Spirit? Lau. Too just, alas, I own your Fears; yet may Despair be your worst Enemy, somewhat We must attempt for your Deliverance. Chris. Impossible! We are too strictly guarded, And Beron in this instant may be coming T'examine, and present us to the Viceroy; Oh what a grateful Present will it prove, To find within their Pow'r the wretched Object Of their Hate, whom every Hour for each Success Gustavus gain'd, they've Curst and Destin'd To severest Vengeance!âThen what I am to Suffer! Death alone wou'd not alarm me thus, But Oh there is no circumstance of Infamy, Or Terror, I've not cause to fear! Lau. A lucky Thought! Oh Madam, I have yet a hope in probability To save you. Chris. Sooth me not with an imaginary safety, But let me Dye with very apprehension Of my Fate. Lau. Only hear me, Madam, And as what I shall offer seems likely to Succeed, or not, or follow, or reject it; You have a Letter from your Husbands Brother, That recommends to him a Son, desirous Of the Viceroy's Service. Chris. What of that? Lau. I think your Husband never saw that Youth, At least in many Years. Chris. Not since his Infancy, being Educated At a College far distant from us. Lau. What hinders then that you shou'd Personate Your Nephew here, as you have done already To Gustavus, and with as good Success? Chris. A Husband's not so easily deluded In a Wife, whose Image has been long Familiar to him. Lau. True, Madam, but in this pretence, the likeness He observes in you, to that known Image, Will help us to deceive him, confirming him That you are truly Nephew to a Lady Whom you so much resemble; and the assurance Of his Brother's Letter, when not expecting you In such a Place, or Habit, must guard him from suspicion. Chris. It cou'd at best, but for a while conceal me. Lau. That's all you need desire, when once you've gain'd Your Liberty, you soon with ease may 'scape his Pow'r. Chris. Hark! He may be comingâHow my Heart beats! My trembling Limbs too fail me! Oh Laura! My disorder at th'encounter will betray me. Lau. Your Fear shou'd give you Courage for this Tryal, Consider 'tis your only means of Safety; Be compos'd and resolute, or you are lost. Chris. 'Tis He, and there's no possibility To shun him. This Counterfeit is worth attempting, Since if it fail, I cannot be more wretched Than without it. Lau. You must profess Zeal for The Danish Int'rest, pretend you made your self A Voluntary Pris'ner. Chris. I must on, Necessity may instruct, and give me Boldness. Enter Beron. Ber. Now Gentlemen it does concern your selves, T'inform me truly, who, and what you are; You'll find the better Treatment from the Viceroy. Chris. Sir, if you'd represent me to the Viceroy For what I chiefly do profess my self, Say, I am one whom not the chance of War, But a desire of serving him, has made his Pris'ner. Ber. We give not easie Credit to Professions; Were you not fighting on the Rebels side? Perhaps are Spies, employ'd to serve Gustavus. Somewhere too I've seen that Face before; Whence are you? We shall find a way To know you better e'er you 'scape us. Chris. I ask not, Sir, your Credit on my own Report, there's here a Person of no small Note About the Viceroy, nearly related to me, Who'll engage for my Fidelity and Truth. Ber. Who is that Person? Chris. His Name is Beron. Ber. Audacious Traytor! I am He you Name, Whom if you'd known, you had not hop'd to practise on, Or to deceive. Sure I shou'd know this Villain Chris. Sir, if you're He to whom I am directed, This Letter will assure me your Protection. Ber. My Brother's Hand! (Reads) Fredage, my Eldest Sonâ My Nephew!âdepend on your Interestâto serve The ViceroyâYou may confide in himânot less Zealous for our Party, than your affectionate Brother. This doth indeed assure thee my Protection: Welcome, Fredage, the Viceroy I engage Shall give thee Welcome, and grace thee with his Favour. Chris. I shall endeavour to deserve it, Sir. Ber. Thou dost deserve it: My Brother has inform'd me How thou'rt Principled; 'Tis well my Boy Thy Father stamp'd thy Soul, t'attone for what Thou'st taken of thy Mothers Family; Thou'rt wond'rous like that vile Adult'ress, My accursed Wife. Chris. How Sir, Adult'ress? Ber. Hast thou not heard of her disloyalty? Chris. That she discover'd to Gustavus your design Of Seizing him, and aided his escape I've heard; but knew not she had injur'd you So vilely. Ber. What other motive cou'd she have To Sacrifice her Int'rest for Gustavus, But that he was a Youth, Handsome and Amorous, Form'd to her wanton Wishes? Chris. Oh Horrid! Ber. Horrid indeed, my Boy, and cou'd I find the Strumpet, Her Punishment shou'd be as shameful as Her Guilt, I'll have her strip'd, and in the open Streets Fix'd on a Rack, expos'd to publick view, Till she expire, more with the Sense of Infamy, Than Tortures.âI think the Viceroy's coming. Chris. Oh support me, Laura! Lau. Bear up for Honour's sake, There's now no fear of your discovery. Ber. 'Tis his Excellence, I'll instantly address you to him, Nephew, Enter the Viceroy leading Constantia. Maria and Attend. Vice. Had I before beheld my beauteous Pris'ner, I shou'd not then have rated her so lightly, Not Arwide, nor what e'er his Arms have Conquer'd, Had been sufficient to redeem a Prize, That justly may be set above all Ransom! Ber. May it please your Excellence. Vice. Beron, what did'st thou tell me of Constantia? Can this be she whose haughty bold reproaches, So stung the Proud Arch-Bishop? Ber. The same, my Lord. Vice. Oh she appears to me all mild and gentle, Soft as the tender Wishes she inspires! Ber. Your Excellence is happier in her Favour. Your other Pris'ner too will unexpectedly, Be found your faithful Servant. Vice. I had forgot, Thou went'st to be inform'd of their Condition. Ber. That Youth, my Lord, permit me to present you As my Nephew, and one most Zealous for your Interests. Vice. How! Was he not taken in the Rebels Party? Ber. A willing Pris'ner, not having other means Of 'scaping hither; for his Fidelity, And Zeal to serve you, I engageâThe cause And manner of his joyning with Gustavus, Himself can best inform your Excellence; Nor may the knowledge be unuseful to you. Vice. I'll talk with him apart, bid him approach. Ber. presents Fred. to the Viceroy, who talks with them apart. Const. What Pow'r has Love, and Fear for what we Love! That it can thus constrain a Soul like mine, So unacquainted with Disguise, or Arts, To hide it's just disdain, To suffer the detested Adulations, Of this Licentious Viceroy, with seeming gentleness And mild return: Yet scarce is it Dissimulation, Contempt and Hate move weakly in my Heart, Insensible to ought but tender Fear, Fear of my Arwide's Danger. How dost thou think, Maria, he'll return the Viceroys cruel Summons? Mar. I know not, Madam, what to think or wish. Const. Alas thou canst not judge, But I who know the tender movings of his Soul, Know our Affections equal, know to what Mine wou'd determine me, must apprehend The same sad proof of his too fatal kindness! Vice. I'm satisfy'd. Fredage, be near my PersonâYour Pardon fair one. Enter an Attendant. Attend. My Lord, the Trumpet is return'd with Answer From the Rebels. Vice. Bid him EnterâMadam now You'll know on whom your Beauties have most influence. Const. Oh my Heart! Enter Messenger. Vice. Hast thou declar'd our Message to Count Arwide? Mess. I have my Lord, Gustavus too was present, And in the Name of both thus am I bid To answerâIf you dare execute your threatned Sentence, They vow Revenge, by the immediate Death, Of all the Danes who now are in their Pow'r; Nor doubt they to be soon disposers of your Fate, And at your Peril dare you to provoke 'em; Assur'd what e'er Constantia suffers here, Your Doom shall be the same, and all th'adherents To your Party. Const. Bravely return'd! Worthy My noble Lord, worthy our glorious Cause! Vice. What Cause is worthy such a Sacrifice? But 'tis a plausible deceit, that oft Imposes ev'n on our selves, oft we Account to Glory and to Virtue, what's due Alone to our Insensibility; Did Arwide now behold you with my Eyes, He cou'd not thus assume th'unshaken Patriot. Const. Not with thy Eyes indeedâBut Arwide has in view No end of Being but the publick Good; And yields a Life dear to him as his own, To save a sinking Nation; for which he knows Constantia Dies as willing, as He unwilling Lives. 'Twere partial to repine in falling by a Tyrant, Under whose Cruelty my Country bleeds. Vice. For my attempting to disarm a brave Successful Enemy, you cannot blame me, Fair one; But think not, Oh believe I never cou'd Design against your Life. Const. My Death's the least of Ills thou dar'st design, 'Twill pass unmark'd, in thy Black Roll of Murthers Unprovok'd, in that sad Day when none of all This miserable City, but lamented Some tender Friend, or dear Relation Massacred, Under the Sanction of thine and thy Associate Prelates barbarous Sentence! Vice. From you I've not deserv'd these warm reproaches; Judge me Constantia on your own experience, The springs of publick Actions are unseen, And all conjectures on appearances, Rash and uncertain; you have not found me Cruel, And may find I dare the hazard of my Kings displeasure, Nay ev'n of my Life, for your dear Safety; Then think who merits most your Gratitude, Or Arwide, or this Tyrant; and if you can Be just to him who dares most to preserve you, Be Mistress of my Fortune, and my Pow'r. Const. Basely thou offer'st, what thou'st basely gain'd! Yes on my own experience I may judge thee, This Moment's of a Piece with all thy past Licentious Life, spent in indulgence of Thy own, or infamous subservience to Thy Masters lawless Passions. Vice. How art thou chang'd from what I first beheld thee! Oh yet resume that softness in thy Eyes, That sweetness in thy words, that charm'd my Soul! The dear Idea yet defends my Breast, Against the Rage to which thou woud'st provoke me. Yet meet my offers with a grateful smile, Respect my Pow'r at least, nor urge your own Destruction, favour my Wishes and assure your Safety. Const. I know 'tis not in thee To give Life on honourable Terms, Therefore I urge my Fate; Nor can I deign thee That Respect which I shou'd pay thy Rank In any other, Thou whose Crimes alone, Whose servile Conscience, was the only Merit That rais'd thee from the Dregs, the meanest of the People, Art by this Greatness but become to me, A more exalted Object of Contempt. Vice. Ha! 'tis too muchâI may become an Object of your Fear, Thou ha'st extinguish'd one, but ha'st enflam'd A more impetuous Passion, that will not be resisted; My Vengeance thou shalt gratifie, disdainful Woman! Hence, bear her quickly hence, to instant Death! Beron, see thou my Orders executed, Nor give me leisure to RelapseâNow drag Th'Enchantress to her Fate, whilst I have Pow'r to doom her. Mar. Oh, Madam, you have lost your self; Be not thus desperate, one gentle word May yet revoke your Sentence. Const. Forbear, Maria, I've done but what I ought, My Life had been a check on Arwide's Valour, An Obstacle to Sweden's Liberty; Nor was there other means to save my Honour. Mar. Alas! Const. Lament me notâWe're Born to Dye, And when occasion's giv'n us to improve Th'inevitable universal Doom, To Virtue, and a publick Benefit, 'Tis a just cause of Gratitude to Heav'n. I'm ready Officer.âThis only to my Woman, If thou escape the Tyrants Cruelty, Tell my dear Lord I bless'd his Resolution, But Dying beg'd him not to seek Revenge, Beyond what's needful to his Countries Safety; Conjur'd him not to grieveâBut he will grieve, Oh say I had no regret, no pang in Death, But what I felt for Arwide! As she is going Arw. Enters. Arw. Live wondrous Excellence! Thy Arwide comes To save thee. Const. What ha'st thou done! Arw. Viceroy, behold the Ransom of your Pris'ner. Vice. Ha! What art thou? Arw. Thy Mortal Foe, A fitter Object of thy Cruelty; Unarm'd I am come (the only way thou durst Encounter me) on thy own Terms to claim Constantia's Freedom. Vice. We have Conquer'd then That haughty Hero, who defy'd my Pow'r, And soon was to be Master of my Fate! Arw. Insult not, Dane, we know how much thou dar'st Against defenceless EnemiesâBe satisfy'd Thou'st found indeed the means to Conquer me; Set her in safety, then exert thy Pow'r, The worst thou can'st, I came prepar'd to suffer. Vice. What's due to an audacious Rebel thou shalt suffer. Const. Oh insupportable! My Arwide, why, Why ha'st thou ta'n this fatal Resolution? Arw. What cou'd I less, when thy dear Life was threatned? Const. Alas, was this the way to save my Life! Too sure thou hast giv'n me Death, and hast depriv'd me Of all the Consolation, all the Glory of it; I've only now in Death to think my self The wretched cause of Arwides, and my poor Deserted Countries Ruin. Arw. No, my Constantia, Sweden will be deliver'd, and thou may'st live To share it's Happiness, Gustavus is Sufficient for that work; Be satisfy'd My Love thou soon shalt see thy Husbands Death aveng'd. Const. See it aveng'd! No Arwide, if my oppress'd, my breaking Heart Deceive me not, that fatal stroke that gives Thee Death, will doubly gratifie the Tyrants Cruelty, I can't out-live that Moment: And must I live To see it! Oh Arwide, Arwide! Why hast thou been Thus desperately Cruel! If thou woud'st Dye, Thou shoud'st have follow'd me, thou shoud'st have spar'd Thy Wife this dismal meeting, this distracting grief, To see thee Perish for Constantia! Didst Thou think I cou'd support it! Arw. Do not un-man me! Thou know'st the softness of my Nature, And shoud'st not with thy Sorrows move me thus; Our Enemies will Triumph more in this, Than all the Tortures they can make me suffer. Const. Alas what Constancy cou'd stand this Tryal! It is not Virtue, but Barbarian Cruelty, To be unmov'd with others sufferings; I must lament thy fatal Tenderness, And thou shou'd grieve, grieve that thou'st broke my Heart! Nay, do not Weep. Vice. Oh how she fires my Heart with Love and Rage! What Charms, what most transporting Extasie Such Tenderness wou'd raise! But lavish'd on another 'tis insupportable! I have too long endur'd itâMadam, I find Your Presence indisposes Arwide to receive The Fate for which he came prepar'dâRemove This Rebel hence to a secure Confinement, My farther Orders, Beron instantly shall bring you. Const. Hold, let me but stay a moment, The Viceroy gives you leaveâOh say, my Lord, Has not this sad Encounter mov'd your Pity? I see it has, I see you melted to unusual Softness; Oh turn it all to Mercy! You cannot let Him die for having giv'n this wond'rous Proof Of unexampled Love, which wou'd encline The most obdurate Savage to Compassion. Arw. Forbear, my Love, thou canst not hope the Tyrant Will be mov'd to save my Life. Vice. No, well thou know'st Justice demands thy Death; And now, Constantia, we have pow'r by him, To be effectually reveng'd for all Thy Pride and Scorn. Const. You have indeed! Oh too severely you may be reveng'd! And am I then the Murd'ress of my Husband? Distracting Thought!âThe Viceroy is by me Incens'd to thy DestructionâOh how shall I retrieveâ He sees me humbled to this low Submission, [Kneels. Depress'd with Grief, confessing my Offence, With Tears imploring MercyâYet thinks me less An Object of his Pity, than his Hate; Insensible of all my Misery. Vice. Doubtless you wou'd not deign t'accept of Mercy, From the detested Tyrant of your Country. Const. Oh give a Proof that I have wrong'd you, in Those wild Reproaches; Grant me my Arwide's Life, And I will think you never were that Tyrant, That you were ever good as the guardian Spirits that protect us; Or if I cannot, The daily Subject of my Prayers shall be, That this one Act of Goodness may attone For all the Failings of your Life before. Vice. Rise, Madam, Arwide's Fate is not determin'd, And may be to your WishâRetire a while, We must consult on this important Case. My Lord, your Prison's an Apartment in this Palace, To which your Guards are ready to attend you. Be careful of your Charge. Arw. I came not here to Fly, Give Orders for Constantia's Liberty, And be secure of me. Vice. You are not to prescribe us what to order; Nor is't resolv'd how she shall be dispos'd of. Arw. How, faithless Dane, are you not paid her Ransom? What Pow'r, what Right hast thou to Sentence me, But on Condition to release my Wife? Vice. Ask thy own Folly thatâYou're both my Pris'ners, And on our Will your Destinies depend. Arw. Base treacherous ViceroyâBut all are thus rewarded, Who credit Men injur'd like thee, to Perjury, And foulest Treasons. Const. The Viceroy knows he shou'd in vain release me, Whilst thou art here not Death it self shall part us. Vice. Then I have greater Pow'râConfine 'em separately, [To the Guard. Nor suffer 'em to meet upon your Lives. We do not use to give such Grace to Rebels. Const. Is it too much to let us dye together? Oh Arwide, hold me to thee, do not leave me. Vice. Away with 'em. Arw. My poor Constantia! Const. Oh miserable Parting! Arw. Perfidious barbarous Tyrant! [Exeunt, led off severally. Vice. All quit the RoomâYou only Beron stay. How! Shou'd he live because she dotes upon him! 'Tis therefore he shou'd DyeâAnd yetâSay Beron, I need thy Counsel how to use the Power This Rebel's Dotage gives us. Ber. Is that a Doubt, my Lord? Justice, Revenge, And your immediate Interest, require his Death. Vice. Art sure my nearest Int'rest does require it? Oh Beron, thou canst look into my Heart, Spare me th'unfolding of my secret Wishes, And give me Counsel suited to my Weakness. Ber. Wou'd not the Death of a lov'd, happy Rival, give New Hopes to a neglected Lover? Vice. Oh did'st thou not observe, how soft, how condescending, Constantia seem'd, whilst fearing for her Arwide? But when she thought him safe, how haughty, how inflexible? What then is to be hop'd, if the dear Object of her Care Were lost, but Hate of him who had depriv'd her of him? Ber. Works it that wayâ Love ever best discerns the way to please; No doubt, my Lord, the hopes of Arwide's Safety, Will gain upon a Spirit like Constantia's, More than all other Promises or Threats; Suppose you offer Arwide's Life, on the Condition To obtain her Love? Vice. What, to be favour'd for a Rival's sake? The Thought wou'd dash my JoyâAnd yet ev'n now, Tho' pleading for her Lord, the tender Accents Mov'd my thrilling Breast with strange Delight; What then wou'd the Possession of her Beauties? It shall be soâconduct her to me instantly, This Moment I wou'd see her in all that tender, That engaging Softness, that melted me To Love, to new Desire. Ber. So please your Excellence to give me Pow'r, I have a farther Project, that may both Be serviceable to your new Desires, And the Destruction of your Enemies. Vice. What do'st thou drive at? What am I to do? Ber. Insinuate to Constantia, that in this Exigence, Arwide may himself consent t'accept Of Life, upon the Terms you offer. Vice. In vain, She knows his Soul too well to credit it. Ber. Yet if my Politicks deceive me not, She soon shall see that very Article Sign'd by himself, with others most injurious To his Party, which artfully discover'd To Gustavus, may raise such a Commotion Betwixt those Lords, and their Adherents, As must be fatal to their Cause, and give New Life to ours. Vice. Thou talk'st of things impracticable, Arwide's intrepid, obstinate to Honour, Not to be seduc'd by Fear, or Int'rest, To betray his Cause. Ber. He is my Lord, And like all other Honourable Fools, He's unsuspecting, open and unweary, On that I form my PlotâMy Lord, you know I build no Castles in the Air; Trust me, He shall be drawn to sign Conditions, At which you'll be amaz'd; and both Gustavus, And Constantia, deceiv'd, and most incens'd. Vice. If this were possible, her Anger against Arwide Wou'd be a pow'rful Advocate for me. Ber. Doubt it not, my LordâOnly allow Me Pow'r to give him present Liberty, And what Security he may demand For his Wife's Safety. Vice. Give him the dearest Hostage He can ask; make any Terms thou wilt, I'll stand to all, so thou effect thy Purpose. Ber. May Love be as propitious to your Lordship: The Lady shall be now conducted to you, That whilst I'm practising upon the Husband, You may observe where she least thinks of Danger: The firmest Virtue apt to be secure, Unguarded leaves some unsuspected Part, Which gain'd, subdues the best defended Heart. [Exit Beron. Vice. This Beron's native Subtlety, and practis'd Artifices, give me Hopes of what From any other I shou'd slight as empty Boasts, A Project of Impossibilities. [Enter Archbishop. Th'Archbishop! unlucky Interruption! I fear'd your Grace wou'd have avoided me, After your late Misfortune. Arch. Wherefore, my Lord? I have not fear'd to face your Enemies, Nor fled from thrice our Numbers. Vice. Wou'd we had left some farther Work for your Unquestion'd Valour;âBut, what can now be done, When all our Force, reserv'd to save this City, Our last Stake, is sacrific'd? What Hope, what Remedy? Arch. Our way by Sea is open yet, my Lord; Have you no fresh Assurance of Recruits From Denmark? My Advices mention none, What do your last import? Vice. Some Orders which I fear unseasonable now, That we command the Danish Governours, In every Provence where we yet have Pow'r, To put to Death all of this Nation, whom They can secure, assur'd there's not a Swede But has some Kindred, or at least his Wishes In the Rebels Party;âI need not tell your Grace The Clergy is excepted; All our Enemies, Tho' your own Country-men, alike are yours. Arch. Perish my Country men, rather than that Accursed Boy shou'd Rule 'em! Let him Reign In a depopulated Desart, Monarch Without Subjects. Vice. Were we our selves secureâ Arch. When 'tis too late to think of Safety, 'tis time To take Revenge. Vice. They're surest when together: We may keep off the Odium from our selves By a Retreat to Denmark, on Pretence Of bringing Aid from thence. Arch. I like your Counsel, Our Presence there will hasten their Assistance, If any is design'd: And let them here Begin your Orders with the Death of Arwide, And his Wife, as Signal to the rest. Vice. I have some hopes, my Lord, to make his Liberty More advantagious to usâFor his Wife, 'Twill have a better Face, and be of use, To carry her an Hostage into Denmark. Arch. I shou'd not so adviseâHa she is coming, I wou'd avoid th'Encounter. Vice. Your Grace is ready to depart to morrow. Arch. I am,âBut do dot let Gustavus Triumph In our Retreat: If Arwide's Death precede it, We disappoint at once his Love and Hate, He'll curse a Victory obtain'd too late, To save his Friend, or to avenge his Fate. [Ex. Archb. Const. They tell me I am brought to know my Doom, In my dear Lords. Vice. You're come to give his Doom, Nor only his, two Lives upon your Sentence Must depend; Be merciful, and both Will bless your Goodness. Const. Alass, what mean you? Vice. Oh, you know my meaning well Constantia, With one kind word you may preserve your Lord, And make me bless'd beyond Imaginations! Const. What must I say? All that I can I will. Vice. Is it too much to give for Arwide's Life, All you have given to gratifie his Love? Const. 'Tis true, my Lord, you've seen that I esteem My Arwide's Life, much dearer than my own; But think not that I prize him more than Virtue; Nay, to preserve him on dishonest Terms, Wou'd blast ev'n all my Happiness in him, With conscious Shame to be unworthy of him. Vice. Suppose he shou'd, in this Extremity, Himself consent to the Condition offer'd? Const. Not the most shameless Wretch, this Court has hardned, Durst make the vile Proposal. Vice. No matter, Impossibilities may be suppos'd. Const. Vain Supposition, Vain Enquiry, what I wou'd do for Arwide, Were he most opposite to what he is: 'Tis for his Virtues I esteem my Lord, Cou'd he be guilty of a villainous, Dishonourable Action, he'd merit my Contempt, Nor were his Life worth asking. Vice. Then all that Tenderness You've lavish'd upon him, might make another bless'd. Const. Alas, my Lord, Can I obtain no Terms for Arwide's Life, But what are not in Possibility? Why all this Trifflng? If his Death's determin'd, I've but to ask, that we may dye together. Enter Beron. Vice. We've better Purposes for bothâSo Beron, Has Arwide well receiv'd the Grace design'd him? Ber. He has, my Lord, agreed to all the Articles Your Excellence propos'd, tho' with much difficulty On that one relating to Constantia; But well considering, that shou'd he throw His Life away, she'd still be in your Pow'r; And weighing the Advantages you offer, Against a rash unprofitable Death, At length he yielded, and just now has sign'd these Papers, Of whice I've giv'n him the Counter-part. [Gives it to the Vice. Vice. 'Tis well. Ber. Am I to bear your Lordship's farther Orders? Vice. You may give Arwide instant Liberty, 'Tis at his Pleasure when to leave the City. Ber. So I'll inform the Count. [Exit Beron. Const. Oh wondrous Goodness! What has produc'd this Miracle of Mercy! Some Pow'r more than Human has inspir'd, And must reward such Virtue! Vice. You only can reward it, and we hope You'll not be more inflexible than Arwide, Who knows to value Life, and his true Int'rest; Nor have we made him wait your Confirmation. Const. Of what, my Lord? Vice. Part only of the Articles To which he has agreed. Const. I dare engage not to reject one Article, To which he cou'd consent. Vice. Then we're intirely happy, Behold on what Conditions he's releas'd. Const. Reads.] That when the fresh Supplies arrive from Denmark, Arwide shall then deliver to the Danes All the strong Places in his Pow'r; and joyn His Forces with them to subdue Gustavusâ What base Impostor's this! The Character Resembles ArwidesâBut impossible, 'Tis but some artful Counterfeit. Vice. Read on, You know not yet th'Advantages design'd him. Const. Reads.] That the Viceroy resigns his Dignity To Arwide, assur'd the King will readily Confirm him in it, in reward of such A ServiceâThat as Proof of his sincere Design to serve the King, Constantia shall Remain the Viceroy's Pris'ner, to whom Arwide does, in exchange of Life and Liberty, Tho' with regret, resign herâGross Abuse! Arwide disdains a Thought of so detestable, So infamous a Treaty! The Deceit's Too palpable, nor will it serve your Purpose. Vice. We shall pursue the Cheat too far in giving Arwide Liberty; He too will seem Confederate in it, leaving you my Pris'ner. Const. He will not, cannot, no Pow'r, no Threats, no Tortures, Cou'd make my Lord consent to this vile Act; I know his Virtue, which no contagious Baseness can corrupt, nor cou'd be Counterfeit; This may,âIt is, you're practis'd all in Falseness, We are surrounded by a Crew of Villains, Bred up to Treachery, to Tricks, and Snares; Oh Tyrant, wou'dst thou Murder him in Fame! No, by our Death we'll give thy Arts the Lye, Be thine the Curse to live in Infamy. Re-enter Beron. Ber. Count Arwide begs Permission to attend Your Excellence, and give Constantia His last Adieu, e'er he return to th'Army. Const. 'Tis false, my Lord sent no such Trayt'rous Message. Ber. Himself will soon confirm it. Vice. What do'st thou mean? He cannot in reality [Apart to Beron. Have sign'd these Articles; their meeting must Unravel all thy Plot. Ber. Trust me my Lord, as this Design is manag'd, [Apart. I doubt not that their meeting will most effectually Deceive Constantia; And 'two'ud be much Suspicious to refuse that Liberty, Whilst we pretend to Treat in Terms of Friendship. Vice. As thou wiltâ(Aloud.) We can refuse him nothing, He shall see her. We're ready to receive him. [Ex. Beron. Const. What means all this? If there's a Possibility to know The Best, from the most Profligate of Men, Arwide's incapable of such a Baseness; There's no Appearance to be credited, No Proof of Honesty, if he is False (Re-enter Ber. with Arwide. He comes to clear my Doubts, and his own Fame. Arw. My Lord, I cou'd not willingly depart, Without a fresh Assurance from your self, That you will faithfully perform your part Of our Agreement. Vice. Be assur'd I will. Arw. Your Hand, my Lord, is wanting to this Paper, As to its Counter-part I've giv'n mine. Vice. Most willingly I'll sign it. [Takes the Paper. Const. What do'st thou talk of Arwide? Thou didst not, cou'dst not, sign that cursed Paper. Arw. I did, Constantia. Vice. We hope you will not fail in your Engagements. [To Arw. returning the Paper. Arw. I've giv'n my Wife too dear a Pledge, and Proof Of my Sincerity to let you doubt it; And Upsal shall, if I have any Pow'r, Be soon deliver'd up to the Archbishop. Const. Oh 'tis too true! Himself confesses all! Ber. My Lord, you're not sufficiently inform'd [To the Vice. apart. Of this Affair, to stand a longer Conference; I beg you to withdraw. Vice. Thou wou'dst not give them opportunity Of free Discourse together. Ber. 'Tis probable His Ignorance of what he is accus'd of, And her Resentment, will a while prevent An Explanation; However I'll observe, And interrupt 'em, on any danger of Discovery. Vice. I trust to thee in allâMy Lord, we will retire, To leave you more at Liberty in Parting. [Ex. Vice. and Ber. Const. And thou hast then deserted Thy Wife, thy Friend, and thy lost Countries Int'rest. Arw. Deserted! the Terms I've gain'd, and the Security For their Performance, are beyond what we cou'd hope; For what I've granted them, however favourable, I know in such an Exigence, Gustavus Wou'd not have himself refus'd. Const. Is't possible! Can this be he, who not an Hour since Came with transported Love to free Constantia, And resolute to Dye! 'Twas false, 'twas all pretence, He came but to betray Gustavus, and expose his Wife with greater Infamy. Arw. Alas, my Love, coud I in Dying have Deliver'd thee, I'ad freely giv'n my Life; But thou had'st still been in the Viceroy's Pow'r, Who might without Conditions have detain'd thee. Const. The baseness then wou'd have been His, not Thine, Thou had'st Dy'd with Honour, nor have left thy Wife With that reproach, thou'st now entail'd on both. Arw. Thou know'st not sure upon what Terms I leave thee. Const. Infamous Terms! No more of that, it will Not bear expostulation; there are not words T'express what thou ha'st done, or what thou art! But think not I will long remain the Hostage Of thy Treatyâ Arw. Thou need'st not, all will soon Be finish'd, the Danes will speedily embark The Places I surrenderâ Const. Forbear, let me not hear it from thy self, Nor let me live to see my wretched Country Betray'd by Arwide! Oh miserable Change! That now the greatest Blessing I can hope Is the Destruction of my Husband! Never, Never more to see, or think of him, Who lately was so dear to my fond Heart! Oh Arwide I can bear thy sight no longer! [Exit Const. Arw. What means my Love! Stay but to hear thy Arwide, I will not leave thee till I'm justify'd. [Going Beron enters. Ber. My Lord, the Viceroy sends t'intreat your presence instantly. Arw. She must be misinform'dâWhat have you told My Wife of our Agreement? Ber. The whole, my Lord. Arw. Does she know the Hostages you've given For her safety, and that the Danes are all To quit the Kingdom? Ber. She read each Article Arw. Amazing! What can thus insense her! I must be clear'd. Ber. There's time for that sufficient. 'Tis but a Pique Of Love for being left, which will be soon Appeas'd, when she's restor'd.âMy Lord the Viceroy Waits you, on Affairs that need dispatch. Arw. Excuse meâI attend him. Is't possible that just and generous Spirit, That wou'd have giv'n her Life for Sweden's safety, Shou'd thus resent being left a while in Hostage, Or that I yield a part, to save the whole? She has known my Faith, and Zeal to serve my Country, And Oh she cou'd not doubt my tender Love; Nor can I leave her, till she both approve. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE The Viceroy's Palace. Enter the Viceroy and Beron. Vice. Oh curst misfortune, unexpected change! Has this Gustavus been Confederate With Infernals! That we shou'd ne'r be warn'd Of ought in Treaty betwixt him and Lubeck, Till we're block'd up, their Fleet within our Port, That we shou'd find our selves close Pris'ners in A City, which at worst we doubted not Of Pow'r to leave at Pleasure! Ber. That Pow'r you have, Gustavus offers you, and the Arch-Bishop, The Liberty of passing safe to Denmark. Vice. Oh Beron, on what Terms! I must give up My Pris'ners, release Constantia, whom but now I thought securely mine, and Oh what Pleasures Fill'd my imagination! What Hopeâ What might I not have hop'd from her Resentment, In absence of her Lordânow all is lost, All is despair, for ever I must lose her! Ber. My Lord, there are in Denmark, many Ladies As worthy your Affection. Vice. She shall not be releas'd, I'll force her hence. Ber. Impossible, you'll be your self detain'd, 'Till she's releas'd. Vice. Then be it so, I'll stay. Ber. Have not such desp'rate thoughts, my Lord, The Citizens wou'd quickly force her from you, Gustavus threatens them with Fire and Sword, Unless the Pris'ners are return'd in safety; Th'Arch-Bishop too has Pow'r to give her up, And doubtless will, his Liberty depending upon hers. Vice. Cruel necessity! Enter Arch-Bishop, Fredage and Courtiers. Arch. What Consultation now? 'Tis Fated that the Fortune of Gustavus Shou'd be superior, and dispose of ours. Why are the Pris'ners he demands, detain'd? Vice. I thought your Grace wou'd not have suffer'd him To Triumph in their Safety. Arch. Rather than our Destruction. Oh that we cou'd recall, or have retarded But one Day, t'ave scap'd this Destiny! Not to have held our Lives, and Liberty, On the precarious pleasure of this Boy. Vice. When 'tis too late to think of safety, 'Tis time to take Revenge. Arch. My Lord I cou'd retort your words as aptly, But we have now no Pow'r; the City wou'd Prevent such mad Revenge, and turn it on our selves, T'appease Gustavus. Inequitable Stairs! Have I a Soul fitted to such a Fortune? Why was I made impatient of subjection? Why had I not a servile, groveling Spirit, That cou'd have fawn'd, cring'd, and been transported, With a smile of Favour? I might have then Been happy in this change, Gustavus wou'd Have Pardon'd, and receiv'd me into Grace, Despicable Thought! I'll perish rather. My Lord, let's instantly depart, release Your Pris'ners, e'er Gustavus is admitted; We must not stay to see his hated Triumph, Confess his Power, be willing, double Slaves. Vice. Well, what's inevitable must be suffer'd; Arch. 'Twere madness to reject our offer'd Freedom, By which alone we've means to be his Plague, Still to disturb his Peace, and make our Vengeance Lasting, as his Fortune! Vice. Go, Beron. See the Pris'ners conducted to the Gates. Enter Constantia and Maria. Ha! Support me in this Tryal Beron, I shall revoke my Grant, and to Mankind Betray my weakness! Ber. My Lord, consider You'll in vain attempt detaining her, And only run your self on certain Ruin. Vice. It must be so. Const. My Lords, I'm told we're Prisoners no longer. Arch. Ay, you may now insultâBut tell Gustavus We yet have Pow'r of VengeanceâTho' you Triumph, His Mother, and his Sister, still are ours. Const. Alas, I have a dearer part engag'd Among ye, to divide my Soul, my Fate, And turn my wretched Triumph on my self! I came not to insult, but to Petition. Vice. Can we have ought to Grant? Const. That I may with my Woman be permitted To depart, before the other Pris'ners Demanded by Gustavus, are deliver'd. Ber. Mind that, my Lord, consent to her Request, It may be advantagious to our purpose. [Aside to the Viceroy. Vice. Since you must goâthe manner as you please, My Guard shall set you safe without the Gates. But Oh, Constantia, think on the Slave you leave At least with Pity, nor curse me for the faults your self have caus'd. Const. I am not us'd to Curse, and now alas, Baseness and Guilt are grown so universal, Were all just imprecations heard, Mankind Might be destroy'd. The worst I dare implore Against ye now is thisâBe all the Ills ye purpose Disappointed, and all the past forgiv'n! [Ex. Const. and Maria. Vice. Why do I let her go! Death were less painful! Ber. This is the only moment you will think so, Support this Pang, and you've no more to struggle with. Fred. So please your Excellence, I might attend Constantia to the Camp. Vice. Fredage, 'tis true, thou'rt with the rest demanded By Gustavus, but woud'st thou run our Fortune, We'll inform him thou stay'st a willing Pris'ner with us. Ber. My Lord He'll be of better use among The Enemies, whilst unsuspected; none More fit to be employ'd in our design To make a breach 'twixt Arwide, and Gustavus; I've giv'n him the Paper sign'd by Arwide, And have engag'd him to assist our purpose. Vice. 'Tis well, his Service shall not want Reward, But lose no time, Fredage. Fred. I'll do my best, my Lord, but in my Judgment, Discovering Arwide's Treaty with your Excellence, Will rather Prejudice than serve your Cause. Ber. Nephew, be satisfy'd we know our Int'rest, You shall have my Instructions. Vice. Obey your Uncle. You may return with Arwide to the Camp. I wait your Grace. Arch. Think not ye loyal Swedes, [To the Attendants. That we discharge ye of Fidelity, And Duty to your King; we've left our Orders To defend the City, and shortly shall return With Aid from Denmark; mean while remember, I charge it on your Consciences, to keep Your due Allegiance to King Christiern; and do engage He will not less reward his faithful Subjects, Than punish the Perfidious. [All the Attendants bow. Ber. My Lord, if I shou'd seem revolted to The Rebels, be assur'd 'tis with design Of more effectual Service to the King. Fred. Oh miserable Fate! to be so near ally'd To such a Traytor! Vice. I know thee, Beron, Nor can doubt thy try'd Fidelity. Whilst you conduct the Pris'nersâWe'll to the Port. Enter Arwide. Arw. My Lord, I may now claim Constantia from you, Howe'er before refus'd the Privilege to see her. Vice. We'd cause to fear she'd influence you against Your own Intentions, of leaving her an Hostage. Arw. That Reason's ceas'dâYet tho' our Treaty's null'd, My Lord Archbishop, I doubt not that Gustavus Will resign your City Upsal, on condition That you no more disturb your Countries Peace: We have no End but to restore our Laws, And ancient Rights; And to accept a Share Of Liberty, is the sole Terms requir'd For our Alliance. Arch. I despise th'Alliance, To be, like thee, a Subject to my Equal; No, if e'er I submit to a Superior, It shall be one whom Nature gave Dominion. Let thy mean-spirited associate Slaves, Worship an Idol of their own creating; Boast of a Pageant Freedom, I disdain Where those obey who've equal Right to reign. [Ex. Arch. Vice. cum suis. Arw. Sweden may boast her Freedom now, deliver'd From that ambitious, proud, tyrannick Spirit. Beron, we'll not detain the Viceroy longer, I wait Const. to depart this instant. Ber. My Lord, she's gone before, e'er this she's with Gustavus. Arw. Gone! wherefore gone without me? what means this Care, To part me from my Wife? Ber. 'Twas at her own Request, most earnestly She beg'd to be alone remitted to Gustavus. Arw. Ha! unkind, unjust, Constantia! Is it Revenge For my design of leaving her? How much unlike Is this Caprice, to what I've wont to find her? Fred. My Lord, 'tis fit we hasten to the Camp. Ber. I attend your Lordship. Arw. Lead on, I'm most impatient, She Triumphs in each Moment of my stay, And I my just Reproach too long delay. [Exeunt omnes. Scene II. Gustavus's Camp. Enter Constantia and Maria guarded. Const. to the Guard. My Friends, you're now acquitted of your Charge, We're here secureâInform the General Of my arrival; say, if he so please I'd wait on himâAlas, what am I doing? [Ex. Guard. Mar. Madam, may I have liberty to ask, With what Intent you're come without your Lord? Const. I cannot tell thee, know not yet what I intend, Therefore I did not, cou'd not, see my Lord, 'Till I determin'd. Oh Arwide, Arwide, On what a Tryal hast thou set my Virtue! Thus to divide my Duty to my Country, and my Husband. At what an easie Rate we keep our Virtue, When it has no Affection to contest with, But when oppos'd, how weak are our Resolves, Or were they firm, how difficult it is To judge aright, on what we shou'd resolve; So liable are all things to receive a Colour From those Passions, through which our Reason views 'em; I fear 'tis that, the soft Reflection of my Love, That wou'd perswade, I ought not to reveal My Husband's Guilt. Mar. No Law, Divine or Human, Has oblig'd a Wife to be th'accuser of her Husband. Const. 'Tis not perhaps exacted; but cou'd I answer To my Conscience, my Country, or the sole Equitable Judge, and Framer of the whole, That to conceal the Treachery of one, I suffer'd the Destruction of a Nation? Is there a tye so Sacred to be held In competition with the Publick Safety? And yetâOh! can my Heart consent t'expose My Arwide, to the Mercy of an injur'd Enemy? He comes, Gustavus comes, and I am still irresolute. Oh! thou who know'st the combat of my Thoughts, Direct them to preserve in this sad Exigence, Both what I owe my Husband, and my Country. Enter Gustavus, with Attendants. Gust. Forgive me if my Joy in meeting you Is half suspended, till I'm assur'd Your Lord is safe; how comes it you are free, If he's detain'd? What Ransom do they ask, Beyond our Offer? Const. My Lord, he's not a Prisoner. Gust. Then wherefore is he separate from Constantia, Why are you sent without him? Const. Oh I cannot speak it! Gust. Ha! does my Friend yet live? Const. Arwide is living. Gust. Why, is he not with you? why this disorder? Const. He'll soon be here, and I shou'd first impart To you alone, a Secret of most high, Most sad Importance. Gust. Retire within my Call. (To the Attend. who go out. You have alarm'd me strangely, what misfortune, Whilst Arwide's safe, and free, can move you thus? Const. I know not what to say.âThus, kneeling first, I must implore your Pardon for a Criminal, Whom, for the Publick Safety, I'm forc'd t'accuse. Gust. Of what Offence? Const. A most detested Treason, Against your Person, and his Countries Liberty. Gust. Can such a Wretch be worthy your Concern? Madam, you must not kneel. Const. I will not rise, Nor can proceed, till I've your sacred Promise To secure his Life, whom I shall name. Gust. 'Tis granted, be assur'd, whom you Protect is safe. Who is this Traytor, that his Life's so much your Care? Const. Alass, he's one too near ally'd to me! And still, I fear, when you shall know his Guilt, You will revoke your Grant. Gust. What has he done? Const. He'as bound himself in a most solemn Treaty, To betray the Kingdom to the Danes, Deliver them the Places in his Trust, And join his Force with theirs, against your Party. Gust. He must be one in Pow'r; once more I give My Word his Life is safe; nor shall he suffer ought, Beyond what's needful to prevent his Mischiefs; For which, 'tis necessary you shou'd name him. Const. I know it, I must Name him, and with amazement You will hear, it isâOh spare me this! My Tears speak for me,âguess whom it must be, That I, in all this Agony, accuse! Gust. I cannot, dare not think,âOh ease my Doubts! Const. And must I, must I live, to sayâ'tis Arwide! Gust. Impossible! who has traduc'd him to you? On what Appearances have they obtain'd Your Credit, against his well known Virtue? Const. Oh that it were so! that the Guilt were mine, Of a too rash, injurious, Accusation! But alass, too surely is it true! Nor cou'd I have believ'd, nor durst have mention'd it, On less assurance than his own Confession. Gust. Did he confess it, to your self confess it? Const. Till then, tho' I had seen the shameful Treaty Sign'd with his Character, I doubtedânay, Scarce did I doubt, so certainly I thought it A base Forgery, till he confirm'd it; Pleaded in excuse, th'Extremities To which we were reduc'd, and wou'd, but I Abhorr'd to hear, have urg'd th'Advantages. Gust. What Advantages? Const. The Government of his subjected Country, Under the King of Denmark, for which I was In infamous Exchange, giv'n to the present Vice-roy. Gust. Most amazing! were not the Grief and Virtue Of Constantia, too faithful Witnesses, I shou'd pronounce this were not possible; Nor is't in Nature for so try'd a Virtue To fall at once so deep in Villany; The Apprehension of approaching Death, Perhaps induc'd him to profess a Treason That was not in his purpose to perform. Tho' ev'n that were so unworthy him, So distant from that artless, that sedate, Intrepid Constancy, of which he wore The Semblance; cou'd he be guilty of such Weakness, What Judgment can be made of what he were not capable, By what he seem'd? Const. Give it no farther Credit, than to guard Against the Consequence, if he were guilty; Let Sweden be secur'd from e'er returning To the Tyrant's Pow'r, and think your Friend Still InnocentâMy Heart will joyn with you, Ev'n now it wou'd perswade me, Arwide is, He must be, what so oft we've prov'd him, Honourable, Brave, and Honest. Gust. Thus far we owe to such experienc'd Virtue, And to the Sacred Name of Friend, once born, To judge the past with Candour, and impartially Observe his future Actions, nor condemn him Of a determin'd Treason, till we've discover'd If he holds Correspondence with the Danes, Or those among the Swedes who're their Adherents. This with all Diligence and Caution we must learn, And carefully conceal his Guilt, for shou'd It reach the Senate, his Life were much in danger. Const. To you, my Lord, your Wisdom, and your Goodness, All now is trusted; I, alas, have finish'd My unhappy Part, nor is there ought for me, But in Retirement from the World, to spend my days In Prayers for his Repentance, and my Countries Safety. Gust. The World has better use of such Heroick Virtue; Nor cou'd you answer your Retreat To what you owe your Husband, or to Justice; Who wou'd observe him with such tender Care, Or judge so favourably his Proceedings? Nor mingle Malice, nor with too rash a Zeal, Conclude against him. Const. Alas, my Lord, wou'd it not ill become A Wife, to live in a dissembled Kindness With her Husband, whilst, in reality, A secret Spy, a treacherous Enemy? Gust. No fond Dissimulation will be needful, Nor ev'n can I so far disguise my Soul, To meet him with my usual Tenderness; He mayâHe will perceive us both estrang'd, The Cause alone conceal, I wou'd not he shou'd know Of what Particulars I am inform'd, Or that you have accus'd him.âFor the rest Let me remind you, none in judging Arwide, Cou'd be at once so tender of his Honour, And zealous for the Publick, as Constantia, Therefore you ought to stay. Const. You, my Lord, direct me, For in this sad Conjuncture, my Affections, My Reason, my Resolves, are Doubtful all, Nor know I what I wou'd, or what I ought. Gust. So please you to retire, some shall attend you To the Tent prepar'd for your Reception; It were not fit your Lord shou'd meet you here, Nor can we yet determine on our Conduct, In this surprizing, most unhappy Exigence, My Fortune ever knew. Const. What is it then to me! Oh who can judge the Pangs I feel, in combating my tend'rest Affection, To sacrifice it for my Countries good; A dearer Victim than my Heart's best Blood! [Ex. led by Gust. who re-enters with Erici and Attendants. Gust. The Wast and Miseries of Civil War now ceas'd, All are return'd to the first State of Nature, When, uncontrol'd, each had the savage Liberty Of living without Head, or Laws, or Order, A Freedom worse than Slavery, the Seed Of everlasting Broils, where all by turns Oppress, and are oppress'dâ'Tis our next Care That an Administrator be elected, Under whose just Authority our Laws May be restor'd, and the divided Nation Secur'd from a Revolt; for which let instantly The Estates be summon'd in my Name t'assemble. Erici. Who is so fit to form this shapeless Anarchy, T'unite the jarring Members, and become Our common HeadâWhat Hand, what Heart, wou'd not submit To our Deliverer, The Great Gustavus? Gust. Forbear th'injurious Mention. Have I with hopes Of Liberty, incited my suffering Country-men To undergo th'inevitable Miseries Of an intestine War, to throw off an usurp'd, An Arbitrary Pow'r, and shall I With more unjust, and treacherous Usurpation, Invest my self with the same lawless Title? Detested Treason! Be it your charge to have The States Assembled, in them is the sole Right To chuse a Head, whose Legal Pow'r all ought, All must submit to; I'll give the first example, Proclaim that I'll this Day attend the Senate. [Exit Erici Enter Arwide, Beron and Fredage, with Guards. Gust. Arwide! Alas, how ill my Heart's prepar'd For the Encounter! Arw. Again to see Gustavus, is the Joy Of one awak'd from Death, to a new Life Amidst his Friends above; or little less My transport, in this more unhop'd for Meeting. Gust, Most sure, my Lord, I did not think, when last We parted, to have met you thusâFredage, Most welcome, I much fear'd for thee, and know not how, E'er scarce the Battle was begun, we lost thee. Fred. My Lord, 'twas my ill Fortune to advance Too far among your Enemies. Arw. Account not for ill Fortune, that we were destin'd To have a more peculiar share, and larger debt Of Gratitude, for that Deliverance, which with us, The Nation owes in common, to Gustavus. Gust. That Divine Pow'r to whom we owe it, still Defend us, nor permit among us, flatt'ring Undetected Traytors, to ruin his great work! My Lord, I see Beron is with you, comes he To congratulate our wish'd Success? Arw. He says, my Lord, that he rejoyces truly In his Country's Freedom, and much repents His past designs against it; on which Profession, I engag'd the Int'rest I once had in you, To obtain his Pardon. Gust. My Lord, you need not doubt your Pow'r with me T'obliterate any Crime against my self, Or ev'n my Country when repented of; Tho' you must own the Treachery of Beron's Purpose, under the disguise of Friendship, Much aggravates the Guilt. Ber. Alas, my Lord, I was but carry'd with the Current of the Nation, Which seem'd too strong, to be oppos'd with safety. Gust. Then since the Tide is turn'd, we may expect, You'll fall in with itâBe it so, nor ask We more of any Swede, but to consult His Safety, and true Int'rest; on those terms Remember we receive youâAnd you, my Lord, That 'tis at your Request I give him Credit. Arw. I answer not for his Sincerity. Ber. Let me be judg'd upon my future Conduct. Arw. That was the utmost purpose of my promise. Ber. Fredage, a wordâ Arw. Somewhat there is unusual in this Treatment, Yet wou'd I not lightly suspect him chang'd. Ber. Doubtless, Constantia has accus'd her Lord, [Apart to Fredage Gustavus's Behaviour speaks it plain; That's half our work effected,âfollow me, We must compleat this mischief. Fred. What can I think Of Beron's Project, 'tis too sure he means No Favour to Gustavus, yet this seems A real Service both to him and Sweden. I must try to fathom the design. [Ex. Fred. after Beron. Arw. Is't thus Gustavus welcomes a lost Friend! I came in all the tenderness of Friendship, To meet your Arms, and open you my Heart; But on my first approach, with looks estrang'd, With cold reservedness in your words, and action, You check'd my forward Love, and damp'd my Joy. Why do you view me thus with doubtful Eyes, As one you scarce had known, or long forgot? Gust. No, Arwide, I have not forgot thy Form, Nor all that dearness which has pass'd between us, But I wou'd look into thy inmost Soul, To know thee there. Arw. Sure there is not another That wears his thoughts so open, undisguis'd, and artless, You know me, ev'n as I do my self. Gust. Scarce do we know our selvesâwhen last we parted, I thought my Heart incapable of any deeper Sorrow;âAnd you perhaps did not believe When you Abandon'd me, your Country, and Expos'd your Life, to be Constantia's Ransom, That you shou'd e'er repent, or change the purpose Of your rash Surrender. Arw. What means my Friend? Are you inform'd what use the Viceroy made Of my Surrender? Gust. I am, my Lord, too well. Arw. Then wherefore urge you as a Change in me, What was Necessity? Gust. Oh did I think Arwide cou'd be by any strait Induc'd to act a mean, dissembling, shameful Part! For worse I wou'd not call it. Arw. My Lord! Gust. Nay do not seem a Stranger to my meaning, Lest I conclude you hardned, and resolv'd To perpetrate a Guilt, which I still hope You but in shew comply'd with: Wou'd you confess Your Weakness, I can give much Allowance To human Frailty; and I find what is abated In your Worth, my Affection wou'd supply. Arw. Ill does this Treatment speak AffectionâWhat wou'd you I confess? Wherefore these dark Reproaches, Unworthy of our Friendship?âHad I ought Against Gustavus, I'd tax him plainly, Confront him with my Witness, or to be justify'd, Or forc'd to own, I did not causeless break The sacred Tye; were it so held by you, So you'd proceed. Gust. Had Arwide held our Friendship half so sacred, He had not been in Treaty with the Danes. Arw. Is that a Crime against it?âYou treated with 'em too. Gust. I did for Arwide's and Constantia's Freedom, Who else, it seems, must have been left in Hostage. Arw. Ha! Has Constantia been complaining then! Was it for this, she hasted e'er I came, To tell her Tale, and set a Friend to chide me? Gust. Then you are Conscious she with Justice might Accuse you, wherefore else suspect you her? Well you're assur'd Constantia wou'd not wrong you. Arw. I know not what she wou'd, in the Caprice Has newly seiz'd her;âBut since my Wife has dealt Thus with me, I disdain to justifie my self Upon that Point.âLet it suffice I had A Husband's Right to leave, or to dispose her As I pleas'dâIs this, my Lord, the Sum Of what I am accus'd? Gust. No, be assur'd, my Lord, I know the whole Of what you dare not mention, and wou'd not understand. Arw. Then force it on my understanding, speak plain, As Honest Men, who've Reason on their side, Are us'd to speak. Gust. Yes, when they have to deal With Honest Men; for close designing Traytors, To warn 'em that their Purpose is detected, And set 'em on their Guard, is better than they merit. Arw. Ha Traytor! This is vile, Gustavus, Fairly own you have at any Rate determin'd To break our Friendship, and want a just Pretence; I shall not importune you with my Affection, Or Complaints, Time, and this Usage, will Efface you from my Heart, and from this moment I disclaim the Name of Friend for ever. Gust. Beware of that, perhaps 'tis the sole Title By which you hold your Life. Arw. My Life!âI will not hold it on so weak a Tenure, If thou hast Right to take it, do thy worst, Again I quit thee of that empty Title; Do rip this Heart, and rid it of the only Fault 'Tis conscious of, too dear a Love, for an injurious, An ungrateful Man. Gust. Oh Arwide! Wou'dst thou yet confess thy Weakness, My Heart is open to receive thee yet, And cou'd forgive thee all. Arw. I've nothing to confess, and scorn your feign'd Forgiveness. Gust. Then thus we partâBe witness to thy self, I've done all that I ow'd to our past Friendship; Thou'rt warn'd, beware, run not thy self on Ruin; My Country's Safety must be my next Care, And Oh believe 'tis with a bleeding Heart, I'm driv'n to my harsh, unhappy Part. [Ex. Gust. cum suis. Arw. To what am I now fall'n! my Spirits that Bore up against the Storm of undeserv'd Reproaches, fail, and leave me sinking in The Calm of GriefâI cou'd ev'n weep the Change Of two so Dear, as were Gustavus and Constantia to my Soul; whilst they were kind, My Countries Slavery allay'd my Happiness, Now when I hop'd to be compleatly Bless'd, They're lost, and all the poor sad Comfort left me, That I am now, the only miserable VVretch in Sweden. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Enter Constantia follow'd by Arwide. Arw. Why do'st thou shun me thus? Constantia stay, I charge it on thy Duty, since I've lost All hold on thy Affection; stay at my Command. Const. I do obey you: Oh that I e'er shou'd dread Th'Encounter of my Arwide! Arw. Cease thy Fears, I mean not to reproach thee, thy own Heart Will tell thee how unworthily thou'st us'd me; Nor shalt thou long be troubled with my presence, Since I have lost the only Blessings which The World cou'd give me, I've no business with it, And will renounce the Commerce of Mankind. Yet I wou'd ask thee once the ground of all This sudden Strangeness, or if thou know'st, wherefore Gustavus has most roughly treated me. Const. Alas, too well you know the fatal Cause! Urge not the Repetition, Oh that it might Be bury'd ever in Oblivion! Arw. EnoughâI find ye are confederate, Both have withdrawn the Kindness once ye bore me, And no doubt have reason to conceal the Cause, 'Twould speak too much against yeâMay Gustavus Bestow his Friendship where 'tis better merited. For thee, that thou repent the Injuries Thou'st done me, is all the Punishment I wish thee. I go for ever from thee, and if I can Forget thee, shall be happy. [Going. Const. I cannot bear it! Oh yet stay, I beg you. Arw. Do'st thou weep the Miseries thy self Hast caus'd?âWhat wou'd'st thou say? Const. Alas, I know notâMust we part for ever? Arw. You cannot think so poorly of me, that I'd live With one, whose whole Behaviour speaks me her Aversion. Const. Ill does it speak my Heart! Oh do not leave me! I'll hide my sad Resentment, live with you In all respectful Duty. Arw. The Offices of Duty not endear'd By Kindness, are Servile, Cold, and Tastless, I'll accept nothing on Constraint; as surely Will I never see thee more, as thou Hast giv'n me cause to curse the Hour I ever saw thee, As thou hast made my future days most comfortless; Nor can'st attone the Ills thou'st brought on thy lost Wretched Husband. [As he is going, Beron enters. Ber. I came, my Lord, t'attend you To the Senate, e'er this the Deputies Are all assembled, and expect your Presence. Arw. They'll have no need of me, I've done my part, Since there's no farther Business for my Sword, My Counsels may be spar'd; nor mean I more To meddle with the Publick. Ber. I have to inform Your Lordship, Matters that will convince you, You've more Business there than you imagine. Arw. Of what Nature? If I in ought can do My Country Service, to that I'm still devoted. Ber. My Lord, I must desire your private Ear, For what I wou'd impart. Arw. Madamâ Const. Apart.] I retire, my Lordâ Beron's a practis'd TraytorâThis Conference May give a Light to what is farther purpos'd, And justifie my LordâI must observe 'em. [Const. withdraws. Ber. I have such Obligation to your Goodness, By whose sole Intercession I hold my Life, 'Twere black Ingratitude not to be truly Zealous for your Int'rests. Arw. I have none, If you are true to Sweden's Int'rests, Beron, Your Debt is well acquitted. Ber. Of that I cannot give a better Proof, Than by the Service I intend your Lordship. Arw. Then freely speak your purpose. Ber. My Lord, your Friends Already are inform'd, how strange a harsh Reception Gustavus gave you; and much Incens'd at his Ingratitude, not doubting That it springs from Jealousie of one Whose equal Merit, and th'important Services He'as done the Nation, give him just Pretences To th'Administratorship. Arw. Gustavus has not such low, selfish Thoughts. But whether tends this Prelude? Ber. To assure you That all the Deputies of both the Gothlands, Who have been Witnesses of your great Actions, Resolve to vote you our Administrator; And Numbers have engag'd to joyn with them, If you appear a Candidate at their Election. Arw. Far, far be it from me, to raise new Broils And Factions in the Nation, by such unjust Pretentions: 'Tis undoubted we all owe Our Liberty to the sole Conduct of Gustavus; Yet not for his, but for the Publick Good, I wish him at the Helm; There's not another So qualify'd to make a People happy In his Government; And if you're not A secret Favourer of the Danish Interest, You'll not oppose the only Means of our Security. Ber. My Lord, I do not see that your Election Wou'd not equally secure us from the Danes; And what may we not fear for you, for all Who've signaliz'd themselves, and rival'd him In worth, when once he's settled in full Pow'r, Since already (believing you no longer useful to him) He'as cast you off with such Indignity. Arw. I know Gustavus Generous and Just, Nor doubt some artful Villain has traduc'd me On plausible Appearances, which time may clear. But be that as it willâCan'st thou who'ast found me So firm to my Engagements with Gustavus, And to my Countries Interests, when both my own, And my Constantia's Life, were sentenc'd by The Viceroy; Can'st thou think I wou'd desert him To the Destruction of the Publick Peace, For a harsh Word, a trivial Quarrel with a Friend? Ber. Perhaps tis not so trivial, but you yet May find your Life in danger: Yet wou'd I not Incite you to secure your self, with hazard Of the Publick Peace; But be assur'd, my Lord, You'll find your Party strong enough to quell, Or ev'n prevent, all Animosities, Were they encourag'd by your wish'd-for presence At the Senate. Arw. Yes, I will to the Senate, Thou hast convinc'd me I have Business there, T'assure all those on whom I've influence, If they oppose th'Election of Gustavus, Or raise the least Division in my Name, I shall account 'em secret Enemies To me, and to their Country.âAll know me far inferior In every requisite Ability For that high Charge, to which Gustavus seems Design'd by Nature; nor can this be other Than the Project of some Traytor. [Exit Arwide. Ber. He is not to be mov'd. Somewhat I must resolveâ It shall be soâThis must create some discord. Erici's hot and hasty, a fit Tool; And luckily Fredage attends my Orders. I'll about it instantly, e'er things Are quite compos'd, or all our hopes are ruin'd. [Exit Beron. The Scene Changes to the Senate, Shouts of the People, Enter Gustavus with a numerous Train, all the Senators rise. 1st. Sen. Hail to Gustavus, our Deliverer. All. Sen. Hail to the Great Preserver of his Country. Gust. Most Reverend Senate, 'tis a joyful fruit And ample recompence of all my Labours, Thus to Greet ye, a secure and free Assembly; For so I may pronounce ye, since I've now Receiv'd from Denmark certain information, That the whole Kingdom, exasperated by The Cruelties, Injustice, and Oppressions Of the Tyrant, unanimously have Depos'd him: The Viceroy, and Arch-Bishop, Dreaded there, and every where abhor'd, Will hardly find a Refuge; nor can ought Obstruct your Liberty and Right of chusing An Administrator, who under your Authority may give the final blow [Enter Arwide. To Tyranny, and heal the Nations Wounds. 1st. Sen. None has so just a claim to our Election, As the brave Gustavus. Gust. My Youth wou'd ill become th'important charge: Think not, most Honour'd Senate, I design The Services I've done ye shou'd constrain, Or sway your Choice; I'll be the first t'acknowledge Him among ye for our Head, whom ye Think fit t'elect; and in what ever Rank Ye're pleas'd to place me; shall account it Honour And Happiness sufficient to expose My Life in your Defence. 1st. Sen. Generous Gustavus! All Sen. Wondrous Youth! 1st. Sen. This Moderation, this unequal'd Virtue, Gives New and Nobler Lustre to thy Glories. Arw. This Noble Youth whom ye applaud with so Just admiration, and by whose Vigilance, Conduct and Valour, ye this Day have freedom To assemble; Young as he seems, already is consummate In every Princely Virtue, that can render him A Blessing to the Nation: Nor can ye less In Gratitude to him, and Justice to The Interests of those ye Represent, Than instantly confer the Royal Dignity And Pow'r, on your generous Benefactor. Gust. Forbear, my Lord, from you this looks not well. Arw. The Senate will approve it. 1st. Sen. Most Joyfully, I doubt not 'tis the Sence and Wish of all. If none has ought t'object against what by This Noble Lord is offer'd, with one Voice Salute Gustavus, Sovereign King of Sweden. All Sen. We all declare Gustavus King of Sweden, All Attend. Long live our King Gustavus. Gust. Not to be sensible of such Affection From my Country, were Stupidity; I Glory in your Love; but for the Crown ye offer 'Tis too much, there are in this Assembly Many my Superiors; Nor dare I undertake the weighty charge. I thankfully resign your Noble Gift. All Sen. We all beseech you to accept our offer. 1st. Sen. Behold the sad effect of your Refusal, See with what Grief, with what dejected Looks, Your People stand, as if the Danes again Were at our Gates: Oh, Sir, on you depends Our Safety; on Gustavus all our Hopes, Our Hearts are fix'd. All Sen. We must not be deny'd. Gust. If ye will have it thusâThe World's great Ruler Assist me to discharge the mighty Trust, Be it as ye please. All. All Blessings on our King. [The People shout. Gust. Believe me, this affection of my People, Is dearer to me than th'effect of it, Great as it is and Glorious. Arw. Now all is finish'd, Since I have liv'd to see my Country free, And our Deliverer seated on the Throne, I have no more to doâ Gust. My Lord, your Zeal for me was most surprizing On Reflection of what had lately past; Tho' 'tis observ'd, when Men wou'd seem what they Are not, they're apt to overact their Part. Arw. If you believe I meant it not in Friendship, Or to advance your Interests, you do me right. Nor is't for me in ought t'accuse my King Of an injustice; satisfy'd to be The only Man Gustavus e'er will injure; I've but to say that I resign your Army, And all I held in charge to your disposal. 'Tis fit the sole unhappy of your Subjects, Shou'd from the Universal Joy retire; To the all-seeing Judge I leave my Cause, And go to hide me, and my sorrows, from The World for ever. [As Arw. is going Erici Enters. Gust. Oh 'tis half my self, I've lost in losing thee! Erici. Stay, my Lord, you must not thus depart. I demand an Order to Arrest Count Arwide As guilty of High Treason, in conspiring Against the Government and Liberty of Sweden. All Sen. Count Arwide! 1st. Sen. Incredible, Count Arwide is approv'd a Generous Patriot; Upon what Evidence do you accuse him? Erici. This Paper Sign'd by him, I know his Writing. Gives it to the Senate. Gust. takes and shews it to Arw. then returns it. 1st. Sen. Amazing! Arw. I confess t'ave Sign'd that Paper, And by the Articles which it contains, Do on the Judgment of the King, and Senate, Desire to be acquitted, or condemn'd. Let it be read in publick. 1st Sen. Reads. The first Article, That when the fresh Supplies arrive from Denmark, Arwide shall then deliver to the Danes, All the strong Places in his Pow'râ Arw. Ha! My Lords, I know of no such Article, So far from having sign'd, it never was Propos'd, or mention'd to me. I desire Erici be examin'd whence he had that Paper. Erici. 'Twas, my Lords, few Moments since Deliver'd me, sent from a Hand unknown, But with this Intimation giv'n, by which The Truth may be detectedâThat Constantia, Knowing her Husband's Treason, had reveal'd it To Gustavus; And that Fredage, a Youth Who then was Pris'ner to the Viceroy, saw Count Arwide sign it. 1st Sen. That Fredage must instantly be sought. Erici. My Lord, I've sent some of my Soldiers for him, And to intreat Constantia's Presence here Upon this sad Occasion. 1st Sen. We'll wait their coming. Gust. Erici, why hast thou done this? Cou'd'st thou Not trust me with the Care of this Discov'ry? I've giv'n my Word for Arwide's Life, which now I fear thy ever rash, thy hot-brain'd Zeal, Has rob'd me of the Pow'r to saveâWou'd thou Cou'd'st learn to think. Erici. In Truth I know not what To think, if Treason must not be detected. Arw. And has Constantia tax'd me of this Baseness! Did she not know me better! Enter Constantia. Const. Oh, my Lord! Constantia is a Criminal, you can't Too much reproach; nor dare I stand th'Upbraidings Of thy Virtue, ev'n silent as thou art, Thy injur'd Innocence enough condemns me. To you, Great Sir, this guilty Wretch addresses, Who has accus'd the Worthiest of your Subjects; I've been impos'd on by some Artifice, And my poor Lord most wrong'd. Gust. Let not your fear of Arwde's Life, seduce That noble Virtue to desert the Truth. Const. Oh think not I'd retract my Accusation, But on a full Assurance of its Falseness; Unseen, I overheard my Lord in conference With Beron, that known Villain, from whose Hand I had the fatal Writing; yet in all Their secret Talk, 'twas evident my Lord Knew nothing of this base Contrivance; But ev'n To Death, refus'd Compliance with the Danes Against his Countries Int'rests; Arwide boasted this, Nor Beron durst deny it, whose Villany Most sure this Treason is. Oh there the Traytor comes. Enter Soldiers, with Beron and Fredage wounded. A Sold. to Erici. Sir, we obey'd your Orders, and found the Youth We were in search of, flying from this other Who pursu'd him, and e'er we cou'd arrive Gave him a desp'rate Wound: The Youth, Inform'd he was to come before the Senate, begg'd His Murd'rer might be seiz'd, and brought with him, Who was (he said) more than himself concern'd In the Affair, on which you summon'd him. Erici. 'Tis well. 1st Sen. Fredage, What know you of this Writing? Fred. My Lord, 'twas put into my hands by Beron, Who not an Hour since retook it, And sent it to Erici. 1st Sen. Know you Count Arwide's Character? or if he sign'd it? Fred. That I shall speak no other than the Truth, Believe, as they're my dying WordsâThat Arwide sign'd That Paper, is too sureâOh! [Swoons. Erici. The Youth's expiring. Ber. Then all is well. [Aside. 1st Sen. Beron, What can you speak to this? Ber. My Lords, I must, tho' to my shame, confess, I have been zealous for the Danish Int'rest, And then was trusted with this Treaty 'twixt The Viceroy, and Count Arwide: But had since, In true Concern for my poor Countries Safety, Giv'n Fredage the Charge of this Discov'ry; Who still too Faithful to the Danes, conceal'd the Treason; And when I urg'd him now to witness what Already was reveal'd, most obstinately He refus'd; for which, in heat of Zeal, I stab'd him, And in dying now you find, he did not dare Deny the Truth. 1st Sen. Your Action was most rash. Ber. I do confess itâBut since incited By Abhorrence of so Black a Treachery, I hope the Senates Pardon. Const. Subtle Villain! Arw. And dar'st thou say I ever read or heard Of those base Articles? Ber. That let the Senate judge, Men use more Caution with an Enemy, Than to sign Blanks or Writings not perus'd. 1st Sen. The Case is clear, were this a Forgery Of Beron's, wou'd that Youth with his last words, Have injur'd Arwide, to confirm his Murd'rers Accusation? What is the Senates Judgment? All Sen. 'Tis plain Count Arwide's guilty, and deserves to dye. Arw. My Life is in your HandsâBut I appeal To the Tribunal of Eternal Justice, To judge between us, and detect the Traytor. 1st Sen. 'Twere better to confess, since Death's your Doom; Nor can you hope to 'scape it. Const. Oh, my Lords! See at your Feet, a Wife who has giv'n this day A dearer Proof of Faith and Love to Sweden, Than the most worthy Patriot here e'er gave; No partial Fondness sways my loyal Heart, Nor do I kneel for Pardon of a Criminal; But to implore ye wou'd avert those Judgments From your selves, from all, which guiltless Blood Will bring upon the Nation! I attest Against ye, and invoke the sacred Pow'rs To witness that my Lord is innocent, And Beron a pernicious, faithless Villain! 1st Sen. Madam, your Lord is legally condemn'd, And our Decree irrevocable. Const. Ohâ To you, Gustavus, I must then appeal, I have your sacred Word to save his Life, Ev'n when we thought him GuiltyâOn that Promise I claim it now, tho' more a Debt to his wrong'd Innocence: Oh do not leave him to their rigid Forms, But by superior Equity acquit him. Gust. Alas! 'tis past my PowerâMadam, Rise. Const. Oh never, 'till the Senates Mercy raise, Or you revoke the fatal Doom, that roots me to the Earth. Gust. Most Reverend Lords, I do beseech ye, Let not This Day be blacken'd with so sad an Omen, As the Death of one who'as shar'd my Glories, Equally with me expos'd his Life, And oft'ner shed his Blood in your Defence: Give to my first Request, the Pardon of a Man, Who tho' he now appears a Criminal, Has nobly serv'd his Country. 1st Sen. This is the only thing we cou'd deny you: For our Security from future Treasons, He must Dye, t'intimidate all Traytors Who shall hear, that no past Services Cou'd Bribe us from the Nation's Enemies: Nor can your Reign begin with a more glorious Act, Than such impartial Justice. All Sen. Arwide must Dye. Const. Dire Sound! My Husband sentenc'd as a Traytor! Oh that he'ad dy'd long since, when pierc'd with many Honourable Wounds, in the Defence Of these ungrateful Wretches! Gust. Oh my Friend! I fear thou'rt lost! that I must yield thee to A shameful Death, ev'n when I think thee wrong'd: I do, my Arwide, tho' Fredage's words Have struck me strangely, Constantia's noble Spirit, And thy Deportment, plead more strongly for thee; Assure my Heart thou'rt worthy of my Love: And must I see thee forc'd from me with Infamy! Oh Arwide, thus to lose thee! Is there no means to save thee? Arw. I have no Witness but the Pow'rs invisible: 'Tis enough that you believe me Innocent; That Villain will be caught in his own Mischiefs, And the Senate soon repent their Sentence. 1st Sen. He threatens us, shou'd we delay his Execution, We know not what Commotions may be rais'd, What Parties form'd against us.âBear him to instant Death. Const. Now break my Heart! that Arwide may behold Himself aveng'd of his first rash Accusers. [Guards seize Arw. Gust. AwayâLet me receive him to my Arms, I cannot speak my SoulâOh Arwide say, Can'st thou in Death forgive thy Friends Injustice? Arw. Your Tears unman meâBe this the last sad Hour May interrupt the Blessings of your Reign: Yet do not quite forget me; Oh, Sir, do Justice To my Fame, and comfort poor Constantia, My only Dying Care. [Turns towards her. Const. I am unworthy of a last Embrace, A Dying Kiss, or ev'n to ask Forgiveness. Arw. Thou dost not need ForgivenessâRise my Love, With such Appearances against me, what thou didst Deserves the highest HonoursâCome to my Heart. To which thou'rt now more Dear than ever. May my Country Be Juster to thy Worth, than it has been To thy unhappy HusbandâI must leave thee. Const. No, my Arwide, thou shalt take me with thee, I will not spare my Eyes the horrid Spectacle; The cruel Blow that lets out thy Lifes Blood, Will strike the deeper to my Heart; each sever'd Limb Of thy dear mangled Body, tear with it part of me, And sooner rid me of the wretched Fate, The Misery to survive thee. Arw. I cannot bear thy Presence, 'twill distract Thy self, and meâI prithee spare me that, Oh Sir assist meâTake to your Care this tender Dearest Blessing, whose sight wou'd only torture me in Death. Gust. Oh my Arwide! who shall assist thy Friend, When a few Moments hence, thou'lt be no more! 1st Sen. My Lord, we hope you're readyâLead Arwide to his Fate. Fred. Oh hold! Arwide is Innocent. [Fred. revives. Const. What Angel's Voice was that? Ber. Fredage reviv'd! Then I am caught indeed. [Aside. Const. Speak; What dost thou know of Arwide's Innocence? 1st Sen. Be careful Youth, you have confess'd his Guilt. Fred. The Pow'rs of Death had seiz'd and stop'd me short, Just on the Point of uttering the most Important Truth; and I am giv'n to Life, But to do Justice to that injur'd Lord. Const. Support him all good Spirits! Fred. Count Arwide was deceiv'd by Beron's Treachery, By whom he had been shewn a Writing, that Contain'd most Honourable Articles; Which when he'ad well consider'd, and assented to, This Beron unsuspected, in its stead, Shifted that other, like in Form, to which The artless Arwide freely set his Hand, Not doubting it the same he had perus'd. 1st. Sen. How know you this? Fred. By Beron's own Confession. Who thought me of his Party, and t'engage me In his Design t'embroil th'unsettled Nation, Imparted to me what I have related; But when he found me startled at the Treason, Earnestly disswading him from the Pursuit of it; In fear I shou'd betray the guilty Secret, He resolv'd my Death, and added to His other Crimes, the Murther of his Wife. 1st Sen. His Wife! Gust. Christina! Ber. Ha, that Traytress! Oh Curst Destiny! Thus to be fool'd by thee. Gust. Again Christina is my Life's Preserver! This Ladies prov'd Affection to her Country, Leaves no room to doubt what she asserts. 1st Sen. Count Arwide is acquittedâFor that Villain A speedy Death's too mild a Punishment; Secure him till our Justice have prepar'd, Tortures most exquisite, a Doom that fits his Crimes. Gust. Again my Arwide is retriev'd from Death To Honour, and his Friend, to these fond Arms. Arw. This is indeed to Live, restor'd to Fame, And to my King's Affection. How shall I pay My Gratitude to Generous Christina? Gust. What care can be sufficient of her Life, To whom we owe our all?âToo long we have defer'd it. Chris. 'Twou'd be vain, I feel th'Assaults of Death. The Providence that governs all Events Of Human Actions, is too good to let A Wretch appointed to so sad a Part, Survive th'unhappy Justice: The great important Ends Are serv'd, for which my Miseries were Destin'd; And now 'tis giv'n me to Rest Const. To be for ever Happy, Eternal Blessings wait thy suff'ring Vertue. Gust. Alas, my Ignorance expos'd you to all Dangers; Had you confided in me, you'ad been safe. Chris. Arwide had then been lost. Now all is well, My Sully'd Fame wou'd ne'er have let me find That Peace I leave all here, and go to seek withâ Gust, She Breaths no more! [Dies. Oh Arwide! Be our Generous Preserver Never forgot, let Fame Record her Vertue, With her Husband's Villany, to all Who e'er shall hear of Sweden's great Deliverance; And every Nation join in her just Praise. Const. That Recompence Vertue will ever find, To be esteem'd, ev'n by its Enemies. Arw. Yes, my Constantia, thy exalted Vertue Constrain'd my Admiration, tho' a Sufferer by it. Oh wou'd Men emulate thy great Example, Renounce all private Ends, give up their dear Their warmest Passions, to the publick Safety, Each wou'd be happy in the common Good, And find that very Int'rest best secur'd, They wou'd have Sacrific'd, As now thy Arwide is restor'd to thee. Gust. Be every Worthy Patriot thus Bless'd; As all who're rais'd upon their Countries Ruins, Assure their own Destruction in the End; So have th'Oppressors of this Nation found: My Friend, remind me oft of Christierns Fate, Whose Lawless Aim at Arbitrary Sway, Depriv'd him ev'n of his Legal Pow'r: All Monarchs who their Int'rest understood, Have plac'd their Greatness in their Subjects Good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Our Authoress trusting to a Brother's Pen, (As who among us trust not faithless Men) Has been deceiv'dâBut that I need not say She took his word, and thenâyou know your way, Like you he kept his PromiseâYou must know it She has no Epilogueâunless I prove a Poet; But lest that hope shou'd fail, she bid me plead How hard, how useless, is the Tax you've laid; When Judgment you against a Play have past, You'll not revoke for a fine Speech at last: And if you're pleas'dâ How Cruel are you in exacting more, From those who've just exhausted all their Store: This dire Effects has caus'd!âFor want of Matter, Or in Revenge, they've rise in open Satyr, Rail'd at their Tyrants, and if Truth they hit, E'n thank your selves for urging desperate Wit. Shou'd we now tell you we despair to gain you, No Fighting, Shewâor Smut to entertain you, Expose the Beaux, and Criticks, boldly say You judge not by the Merits of a Play; Can you blame us, if in defect of Sense, When forc'd to speak, we stand on our defence; Reproach you, that by Faction you are brought To try ev'n Wit by PartyâHold that thought May be of useâWas nothing on the Stage, That cou'd a Party for our Play engage. Let's seeâ To Beron's Character all must be civil, Who're bless'd with Wives, and wish 'em at the Devil; They'll like the Justice of his Spouse's Fate, 'Tis true he's hang'd for't, and if so you hate, You may be rid of yours at the same Rate. Eloping Ladies we have all bespoke, Christina's Cause wou'd be a useful Cloak; But for her Management they'll all despise her, With a young Hero they'd no doubt be wiser; Expose her Life the Secret to conceal! What Secret wou'd not they rather reveal! Well, by this Pair we hope but few to gain, May Arwide and Constantia more obtain, Let all whom they by Sympathy cou'd move, In their Applause of these kind Patterns, prove That they like Arwide, and Constantia, Love. FINIS.</field>
