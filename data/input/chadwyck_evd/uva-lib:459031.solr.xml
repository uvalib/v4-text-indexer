      <field name="fulltext">The Scene, Byzantium.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCEN. I. Scedasus, Patacion, Epigenes, Terpander, Eudemus, Nicias with the Pictures of three Byzantine Virgins. Sced. But there's no other way. Epi. They must be sent Or we must die. Pat. Wee're no such subtile feeders As to make Meals on Air, sup on a Blast, And think a fresh Gale Second Course. Terp. No verily; Let's see thy Pictures, Nicias. I would the Tyrant had a mind to all the Wenches in the Citty, and would barter Bread in exchange: a Loaf a Wench have at him from one end o'th'Town to the other. Eud. Fond men! You strive to purchase a short Liberty By means more infamous than Servitude; If that a Tyrant's lust do burn, are we Bound to supply that which may quench his fury? If his unruly Passion, kindled by Report of Beauty, doth grow big with flames, And saucily exact what e'r is fair And eminently gracefull, as if Nature Had sent it as a Tribute due to him, Though't be the dowrie of another State, Shall we surrender it, and basely prize Our Innocence below his haughty Anger? Terp. I say the Pictures then shall not be sent. Pat. Had we a Magazine well furnish'd, were Our Granaries charg'd with Corn, there were some Plea Against his practice: but this tedious Siedge Forceth our noble thoughts to other waies, Whiles Famine cals that Lawful which is base. Terp. Why then the Pictures must be sent how e'r. Eud. Will you still owe your vertues to your Bellies? And only then think nobly when y'are full? Doth Fodder keep you honest? are you bad When out of flesh? and think you't an excuse Of vile and ignominious Actions, that Y'are lean, and out of liking? for I must Speak of you now as Cattle, whiles you thus Enslave your selves unto the Paunch, enduring A Tyranny beyond that you complain of. Terp. I say he must speak of us now as Beasts; Say what you will the Pictures sha'n't be sent. Sced. 'Tis better do't than starve. Eud. Well rumbled Belly; There spoke a stomack. Terp. I, there spok a stomack. Sced. We have not strength left to uphold our weapons; Armour, that was e'r while a Garment only, Is now a Burthen. Famine hath imprinted Old age upon the Visages of Children, And Youths appear like th' Ghosts of the deceas'd; Or like some Creatures, whom the Destinies Will not permit to dye; W' have scarce enough Flesh to receive a Wound, no force to give one; Would you have Skelleton maintain a fight That will fall with th' Ayre of the passing Dart? We have not vigour to defend our selves, Nor yet a Sacrifice to win the Gods Over unto our side. Eud. To win the Gods? Have you not Minds, and Pray'rs? 'tis not the Beasts Heart that propitiates Heaven, but your own. Think not that I engage my self in this For a particular end, a private good; 'Tis common what I aime at: 'tis not that My Daughter 's liable to his choice That I diswade. Whiles I deny the sending Of these three faces, I deny your Wives, Your Daughters, nay, perhaps your Sons; for that Which now desires but one, will spread to all; Without distinguishing of Age, or Sexe. Think what a Blot will stain our memory To all Posterity, when't shall be said Byzantium was a Pander to a Tyrant. Let yet our miseries be honest; let us, If that the Gods deny us happinesse, Persist unfortunate without Reproach. Terp. And that's considerable, wee'l be honest sure. Epi. We do approve your reasons; but if he (As it is likely) conquer us, we shall 'Mongst other our indignities, be sure To suffer this too. Then consider with What mind we do't; we yield up one to reskue All other from abuse. Our own misfortunes Are not as yet i'th' Catalogue. What can we Expect so mercifull as death? he won't Indulge a killing torment; we shall be Reserv'd to after miseries, and life Only kept in to keep us longer dying. Terp. Marry God forbid; we will not be mangled sure. Eud. Fear never wanted arguments; you do Reason your selves into a Carefull bondage, Circumspect only to your Misery: I could urge Freedom, Charters, Country, Laws, Gods, and Religion, and such precious names; Nay, what you value higher, Wealth; but that You sue for Bondage, yielding to demands As Impious, as th'are Insolent, and have Only this sluggish aime, to perish full. Terp. Painter, budg not a foot, wee'l stand it out. Nic. You speak most rightly Sir, but we are hungry. Pat. Hunger will be the least of evils, we Shall not be found so Innocent, as only To pine, and dye; our miseries will grow savage: Man will refresh himself on man; the stronger Devour the weaker, till at last one pair Be only left who must be call'd the Citty. Terp. Haste for thy life, we cannot stand it out. Nic. I hope your Worships will dispatch me with 'em. 'Tis my request my pains be only thus Rewarded, to present 'em to the Tyrant. Sced. Most fit, good Nicias. All agree? Epig., Pat. Yes, all. Eud. It is one happiness that he askes no more: And we are blest in that a Tyrant's modest, Being beholding to his wishes, that They've put such limits to our Infamy. There is no Beast more stubborn and unruly Than is the Belly: Th' empty and the full Are both alike in this, that they'll not listen. The Brand be yours, if the Misfortune mine. Pat. Sir, the misfortune cann't be only yours; For I've a Daughter too, that in a love To better education waits on yours; Who hath from thence contracted such a tye Unto her Ladies vertues, that she is Resolv'd to run an equall hazard with her: 'Tis my Euthalpe; whom, were she anothers, I would call fair, and vertuous, and deserving. Ex. Eud. Pat. Sced. Epig. Terp. Go, go, go: follow and take order. Nicias, come hither: I'l impart a secret to thee. The truth is, one of us is much o'rseen: 'twas a most improvident thing, who e'r 'twas did it, to go and beget a fair Daughter, and nere aske the advice of the Common Councel before hand. But let's be now judicious, and weigh reasons. Our Innocence priz'd below his Anger?âCarry 'em not Painter. Yet Famine cals that lawfull which is base.âThou must carry 'em Painter. Still owe our Vertues to our Bellies?âStay Painter. Yet no vigour left to defend our selves.âGo Painter. This sluggish aime to perish full?âStand Painter. Yet the stronger will devour the weaker.âRun Painter. All these wisely consider'd, thou must not go, and thou Must go, and so I leave thee. Ex. Terp. Ni. Now I am Legat Nicias: th' only way If you'd perform an Embassie with just And decent Ceremony, is to last long; This Siedge hath sterv'd me into so good Manners, That when I'm feasted in the Tyrant's Tent I shall not choose but make as many obeysances Unto the Chine of Beef, as he that carrieth it Doth to the Chair of State. My lofty Widdow, Who, if that I had dignity, hath promis'd T'accept my Person, will be hence demerited: For though I be abus'd, and made their mirth, To suffer from a Prince is still thought worth. Exit. Scen. II. Pyle, Elpidia. Pyl. Three sent besides? have I so many Rivalls? I'd thought I'd been the PhÅnix of the Citty: But men have left to judge, not I to be What I was ever, fair, and smooth, and handsome; Look we not bright Elpidia, and Maiestique? Elpi. Truly sweet Mistrisâ Pyl. How, you paltry Baggage? Sweet Mistris? when we only want the Tyrants Approving to be Queen? call us your Grace. Elp. Your Grace, me thinks, would make a very Queen, But that you use to beat your servants so. Pyl. Our Maids of Honour you do meanâ Scen. III. To them Nicias. [Pyl.] âNow Fellow! Nic. I hope your mind is chang'd, you will not lay Such an Injunction on your willing Servant: You punish, not command; what could you worse, If you did hate me? Pyl. Dare you question what We please to will? or carry't, or you come not So near hereafter, as to be commanded Again by Pyle. Nic. 'Twere t'incense the Tyrant, With these three Virgins to present your Picture. Pyl. VVhy not our Picture Sir? we are a VViddow But of the first wrinkle; and yet no wrinkle But that we please to say so. Wee're as faire As any Shee in all Byzantium, If that our Glass and Chambermaid tell truth: Why not our Picture, Sawciness? Nic. And 't please you, This is the very reason, why I say It would incense the Tyrant, that we should Keep so much Beauty so long from him. Pyl. Dare you Offer to daube it with your Commendations? And make it less by your approving? know When you do ought but reverence, you disparage; Wee're only to be prais'd by them that are Worthy t' enjoy us, Kings. Nic. I hope you will not Suffer your thoughts to cut me out. Although I am not o'th' Bloud Royall, yet I am Ambassadour, the first of my Trade, that Ere yet obtain'd that Dignity. Pyl. What? doth not The least of our commands entitle you To as much honour as the bigg'st Employment Of the whole Citty can? If you do hope For our Affection, win't by doing this. Nic. Though you are fit to be a sacred Consorr To Majesty, and yield all Asia Princes, Yet give me leave, ev'n for that very reason Not to perform this your Injunction. It were to lose you, while I strive to gain you. Pyl. You are unmanner'd. Reason's for Mechanicks: Stand we for Queen, and be disputed with? Nic. I'm gonâBut pray y' suffer meâ Pyl. You're troublesome, We do command you hence. That you may see We do't in no great Anger (keep behind Sir,) We do indulge our hand, Nic. Good sweet Elpidia, When that thy Mistris shall go o'r the Citty, And aske thee what thou thinkst of him, and him, Drop one good word for me. She is a Widdow; Put her in mind of this my promising Nose; That, and my long Foot, make up perfect Letters Of Commendation to a Citty Widow. Elp. If you have any other signs pray y' tell me; I'l read her th'Inventory of your good Parts. Ex. Nicias. Pyl. The foolishness o'th' Man! But yet we cannot Forbid these poor Mechanicks to affect us: If that he had not undertook this charge, I'd cast him off for daring to deny it; And now he hath thus undertook it, he Discards himself; for I do know that I Must needs be chosen. To requite his love I'l beg his pardon then, for daring to Be Rivall to a Tyrant. How I scorn All names below the Throne! I do feel something That prompts my new-stamp'd thoughts to Majesty; And saies I shall be Queen before I dye: Shee's more than servile that desires not Rule. Hold up our Train Elpidia as we pass. Exeunt. Scen. IV. Philostratus, Callimachus, Prusias. Phil. Now who would live in peace good Prusias? tell me, Is it not better far to seize your Prey In open field, than to stand whimpring at The Chamber door, like to the little Spaniel? Cal. Or scratch upon the Wainscot like my Ladies Black Cat to gain Admittance? Phil. Here you do not With folded Arms embrace your self, because You can't embrace your Mistrisâ Pru. Rightâ Cal. You do not Stand in as many Postures, as a Painters Servant, when that his Master is to daub Some peopled Bus'ness in a Pyebald Canvass. Phil. You do not lye Perdue under the shelter Of an unmercifull Balcony, to Get the Advouzon of an half kiss, when Her first-born wrinkle shall indent her forehead. Call. You do not stand enchanted at her door, Gaping, and yawning, as if some Apothecary Had hir'd your Mouth, and set it for stray Gnats, And Vagabond Flies. Pru. Sweet Captain, prethee on. Cal. At home there's trick on trick. Celadon he Loves Amaryllis, Amaryllis Daphnis, But Daphnis Cloe, Cloe MelibÃ¦us, Fond MelibÃ¦us Mopsa, Mopsa at last Some body, that loves some body, that I know not: Affection goes like a Pedigree; Heart loves Heart To th' end o'th' Chapter. Phil. No such Labyrinth here: No needles hanging at each others Tailes. No Cupid here preserves the Tears of Lovers To mix 'em with the Ashes of burnt Hearts, To make a Lie to wash his Mothers smock in, Which silly sighs must dry. Cal. You shall not have A wench cry pish, and puh. And is't not better To clap the Bargain up for a brace of Drachma's, Than to be bound to call all Women Nymphs, And Goddesses, and Hamadryades; That, when you are alone i'th' Woods, they'l please To be such willing Worms as Men call Milkmaids. Pru. Troth I ne'r thought 'em Deities: I was Alwaies of this opinion, that they did Consist of Flesh and Bloud. I now begin To like all wellin War, except the fighting. Phil. The bravest sport is yet to come: The Ransack O'th' Citty, that's the chiefest. You shall have This Lord come profer you his Daughter, this Burgesse his Wife, and that unskilfull youth Pray you begin to him in 's trembling Bride. Pri. I'm for your tender Maidenheads: I would not Venture my self with a stale Virgin, or A season'd Widow for a Kingdom. Cal. Shalt Make choice among a thousand; let thy Affection Fly at a Flock, a Cloud of Game: I'm tickled To think how we shall find one toothless Matron Environ'd round, and cheerfully besiedg'd With her Strong-water Cellar; The other compass'd With five or six good large deep-belly'd Bottles, And both of them mumping for Consolation. Phil. Then a step farther, and one fearfull Lady Squatted among her Sweet meats; th' other wedg'd Beeween her Gally-pots and Fucusses; A third perhaps doing her Devotions in Potent Eringo's, or praying to her Gellies Against the good houre comes, and all to find Grace in the Conquerours Eyes, Mine, Thine, or His. Call. Then, for the spoile, we shall come loaded home, Gold, Silver, Garments, Pictures, Jewels, Statues, Great massy Goblets, Chalices, and Gods, VVomen, and Boys, catch he that can, they are His own that first laies hold on them. Dull Peace! Hang her! she doth allow us nothing but Those barren things Statutes, and Matrimony. Pru. I'l to the houses where I think I shall Meet with the best Conserves, and tenderst Virgins; Sweetmeats and Maidenheads are all I aime at: I shall not be so good at spoil as you, Being I am but a new-made Captain: wherefore If you Callimachus, or you Philostratus Meet with a handsome Perruke, pray y' reserve it For your friend PruciasâPeace, here comes Misander. Scen. V. To them Misander, Cleodemus, Timophilus. Mis. Hear you no News yet Captains from the City? Phil. They slight you Majesty by their delaies, Thinking to weary your desire by lingring. Mis. I dealt too mildly with 'em, in that I Did offer to request without the Sword: They shall know what 'tis to delude him that Ne'r threatned twice; whose anger then is base VVhen it admits that respite, as to give A second warning. Cleo. 'Tis below your Highness Thus to expect: were you a private Man It were past suff'rance Mis. Do they mock me then? I'l fall upon them like a Judgement. Plagues And Famines shall be modest; what they count A visitation now, shall be my Custome, One of my slightest punishments, and so Reckon'd hereafter among ord'nary things. Cal. Please you but to give leave wee'l force admittance, And ransack all the Citty ere Sunset. Mis. Traytor, thou know'st not what thou wishest: there's A Jewel in't, which if it should be touch'd By any but my selfe, I should account My Diadem guilty of offending Nature. Be thankfull that I pardon thy request. Tim. They are below your Anger; let no such Vile, abject things disturb your higher thoughts, Unto whose fame you'l add by Conquering; Let them enjoy a Peace of your bestowing. Mis. Think not Timophilus to divert my Fury: I'l raze their City into a solitude; Then, if they please, let 'em call that a Peace. My Reconciliation is by Ruine. Tim. Me thinks y' have executed a Revenge Sufficient by the Preparation to it: Anothers VVar carries less Miserie with it Than your Provision for one; and they suffer As Conquer'd, whiles that you do but approach. Mis. They do but grone divided yet; their sighs Fly yet, as doth their smoak, here and there some; I'l have them make one Cloud, wherein I will Sit like a Deity in a softer Chariot, Triumphing over EarthâBut I do ill To menace such misfortunes to a City That doth contain a Virgin of such sweetness As makes each Place Elysium as she passeth: I must be tender of their goodâYet why, Why shall they dare thus to deny her me To whom all things of price are due? They're stubborn; I'l bring those Buildings of that threatning height As low as their Foundations, and their Minds Lower than them. Callimachus, give order Unto the Souldier for a sudden Assault. Cal. You thought it not excusable, but by Your speciall Pardon, that I only ask'd it. I will not dye for doing your Command. Mi. Am I neglected then? Ph. I'l go, and't please you. Mis. Stay, Villain, or thou dy'st. Among the Throng Of more ignoble Creatures, she perhaps Might perish too; but that her Beauty will Disarm ev'n Cruelty it self, and so Work her escape by conquering with a Look. Howe'r the Sin's too much, if that I should Proceed but so far only, as to fright her. Yet there's no other way of winningâGoâ Do notâWhy stir you not?âCome backâ To suffer thus, Misander, for that Blest one (For sure she must be blest that is so fair) Is chief of all thy GloriesâCaptains, to Your charges; what do you here?âI am not well. Ex. Mis. Cleo. Tim. Pru Cal. He hath two Furies in him, Hate, and Love. Killing, and Making Mortals wholly share him. Phil. A little Red i'th' Cheeks will melt him, when A stream of bloud spilt by his own Command, Moves him no more than if 'twere so much water. Call. This 'tis to have an hunting Eye; as he Pass'd through Byzantium, be survey'd each Virgin With a most eager and committing Look. This one among the rest (who e'r she be) He had no sooner spy'd, but his nimble Soul Did visibly climb up unto her Eyes By their own Beams. Phil. And he will hate as soon; I'd rather be his Jument than his Mistresse: Suspicion makes his Bed an Armory; His head lyes never soft untill he hath Guarded his Pillow with a brace of Daggers. Call. His Feare hath brought him too that custom too, That let a Gnat but buzze, he stabs the Ayr, Strikes out of Habit, and sleeps cruelly. Phil. Peace, let's withdraw, if that we mean to live. Scen. VI. Misander, Patacion, Nicias, Timophilus, Cleodemus, Prusias. Mis. Do y' mock me with a shadow? and present A Baby for a Goddesse? I'l proportion Revenge unto your Crime, and leave nought else To testifie the memory of your City, But idle foolish Pictures, such as these. Pata. Our City sends them not in Policy To keep you longer off. It is not, that They may deny you, but that you may choose; And if it please you but to stoop so low As to design but one of them, and make her More fair by such your choise, there shall be no Delay in fetching her, but what you make In giving the Command. Prus. They dare not mock you; You need not doubt performance, I will warrant The very Father will conduct her to Your Bed, and be glad of th' emploiment too. Tim. There's nothing wanting to them but the Life; Did they but move you, th' had been very Virgins. Mis. How dare you look upon 'em, being I am To make my choice of one?âLet's see the Pictures. Nic. These are the very Stars that gild our City: As for this other, 'tis the Picture of one Whose very sight's an Epigram: to draw her Is only lawfully to Libell her. She is a good well-willer to your Majesty. Prus. A well-willer say you to his Majesty? Let's see't. Nic. A Widdow, that I'm Sutor to: I hope you'l scorn to take my leavings Sir. Mis. Whose Picture's this? Pat. 'Tis one Leucasia's, The Daughter of Eudemus. Mis. That is she. Along with them, Timophilus, and fetch her: I love her in the Picture. Nic. O the Times! Not bid me eat? there is no courtesie I see in Tyrants. Please your Highnesse, I'd Fain tell what house you keep when I come home. Mis. Goe, give him what the Camp affords. Nic. D'y' hear To Prusias. Sir, Be fair condition'd; use that Picture honestly I pray y', and do not make my Pencill Cuckold. Exeunt Pat. Nic. Tim. Mis. I wonder his Affection would permit His Art to shew it self in such a Piece. Could he gaze so long on, as to pourtray, And have so little flame, as not to love? As Misan. contemplates Leu. Picture, Pru. contemplates on the Widdows. Shee's too exactly perfect to be brought Forth by a Woman: Nature sure her self Descending to conceive, travell'd with her. Cle. VVhy do you fasten those large Eyes, which should Shed light, as doth the Sun, on every place Due to the VVorld, upon a silly Tablet? Mis. VVhere the bare shadow's such, what is the Substance? That face which carries Natures favours Printed Upon it in such gracious Characters, By a most lawfull captivating Power Makes all our Senses hers. But take it hence: I have her in my Mind, a Tablet that Thine hands cannot remove; there I behold her Drawn by my Thoughts far better than the Pencill. O! I do feel something that is not Lust; A thing that is more subtle, more refin'd Than to be stil'd Desire. Cleo. I hope you will not Begin to yoak your self at last? It is The love of private men that doth descend To Ceremonious VVedlock. You're t' enjoy VVithout that idle knot of Matrimony. Mis. But that I have not leasure now to punish I'ldâVVell; I'l suffer all. Say what you will. VVhat Torrent is't hurries my Passions thus? Here, hold my SwordâGive me't againâI am Of Merits far to light to ballance hers; She will refuse me sureâPray y' leave me Sirsâ Yet now I think on't don'tâHow every Limb Presents a Goddess! every part a Day Darkning the neighbour Jewell!âLet me have Some Musick PrusiasâPrethee Cleodemus Suffer not any to disturb my thoughts; I would be quietâVVhat a sacred vigor Dwels in each sprightfull Parcell!âLow Misander, A shadow can thy larger Thoughts confine; Hiding a Power that's Tyrant over thine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENE I. Callimachus, Philostratus, Prusias after them. Cal. Pox o'these easie Coxcombs! If he had Ask'd Wives and Children too he might have had 'em. Could not their wise simplicities stand out, And let us conquer 'em? Phi. I feel mine Arms Grow stiff again: I shall employ my strength Only in carrying up of Pasties now. Pru. (Is she not wondrous fair? not wondrous handsome?) Cal. We shall do nothing but drink Healths in Helmets To him and his Leucasia, (as they call her) Whiles he encircles her in amorous folds, And practiseth sweet Battels in a Featherbed. Pru. (What Torrent is't hurries my Passions thus?) Phi. Frailty of Man! These Vices are as proper To your great Ones, as Feavers are, or Surfets: Most Birds of Prey, you know, are still so subject To wicked Cramps, they dare not sleep without A soft warm tender Lark all night i'their Talons. Pru. (And must a shadow thus my Thoughts confine? Cal. His tender Lark hath made us lose our hopes Of that tough Kite you wot of, the old Widdow We thought to cast Dice for. Pox upon Hymen; I'd rather bear a Torch to fire the City Than carry one in his Solemnities. [Pru. steps in to them. Pru. Traytor, thou knowst not what thou wishest. There's A Jewell in't, which if it should be lost 'Mong other spoils, I should account my self Guilty of an Offence 'gainst Heav'n, and Her. Cal. Must you be imitating of your Prince In every thing forsooth? And't please the gods, Who is that worthy Jewell? Prus. 'Tis a Name Fit to be sung by Angels, not profan'd By Mortall Tongues. Phil. Hast thou espous'd thy King's Opinion too in Love? Thou that wert wont To make a Dole of thine Affection By scatter'd Lust, dost thou confine thy Dotage Unto a single Face. Prus. She's too exact He repeats what Misan. said of Leucasia's Pict. To be brought forth by Woman; Nature sure Descending to conceive travail'd with her. Cal. I will be hang'd if thou hast any brains; Somthing there is perhaps that swims i'thy Noddle Like to a little Curd in Posset-drink; But for true Brain, 'tis gon. Prus. Low Prusias, Sure thy deserts will never ballance hers. Low Prusias, thou'rt unworthy. Phil. Pray y' who is't That this low Prusias is unworthy of? Prus. O! do not vex me! Cal. This is like the reading Of a great swelling bumbast Coppy o' Verses, And hiding of the Theam. Prus. T'your Charges, Captains. What do you here? Cal. Faith laugh at you. Where is Your Willow, and your Halter? Prus. Do not put me To th' second WarningâO! I am not well. [Ex. Prusias. Phil. Good faith h' hath conn'd Misander, &amp; we came Just to the Repetition. Come, let's follow: We will not lose this sport, although we have Lost both our hopes, the Widdow, and the Spoyl. Ex. Scene II. Pyle, Leucasia, Chryse, Euthalpe, Elpidia. [Phil.] Do we appear, and yet no Reverence seen? Woman, you are unmanner'd. Euth. This directed To me, or whom? Pyl. Is't not enough that you Were thought so worthy by the City, as To have your Face sent as a waiting Picture 'Mong ours, and so arrive to th' possibility Of lying she-perdieu with some old souldier, To save the use of Furrs and Bearskins, but Forgetfull of your own condition (If it be any to be a Waiting-maid) You must contemn us to our Face, and dare To stand upright, not bowing as we pass. Euth. But that I think this Humor (new put on This Morning with that dresse) will set with th' Sun, Being but a Pageant of one day, I would Trouble my self to answer you good Widdow. Pyl. Good Widdow! Y' are a Creature, who at best Are but a living Utensill, a kind Of Sensitive Instrument, grac'd with the Title Of overseeing your Lady's dear delights: What doe you else but feel the Monky's pulse, And cater Spiders for the queasie Creature When it refuseth Comfits? VVhat doe y' else But set perfidious wiles for simple Flyes To keep game ready for the Parakeeto? You'll tell me, that you place disorder'd hairs, Rank some transgressing Curls, call in the Corner Of some uncivill Ribband that starts out, And will not keep the Discipline. You'l tell me, Perhaps, that you manage the Pencill too, Write white and red, and mend the faults of Nature; Pray y' what of this? where you are best esteem'd You only pass under the favourable Name Of humble Cozens, that sit below the Salt. Eut. This Creature you call Waiting-woman, were She yours, perhaps were all you've said: but there Is difference in Relations, and Things Alter their Nature with their Places. Black I'th' Teeth is Darkness, but i'th' Eye becomes A colour of Resplendency: what is Elsewhere unseemly, beams, and sparkles there. That I obey this Lady (whom I cannot Name without honour) comes not from the Meanness Of Birth, or want of Fortunes, but from that Desire I have to store my mind with good. Endowments are an inbred Soveraignty; Shee that hath more than I, hath more Rule too; Which yet by fit degrees I do partake, As I partake her Vertues. To serve thus, Is but to light my Taper at Anothers, That I see burns more cleer. Pyl. This you have conn'd Out of some wandring Story that you read To make your Lady sleep. Eut. To wipe away This, and what else remains; the Names, and Offices We undergo, take not at all from worth. The Sun doth dress your Gardens, will you stile His Beams from thence Ignoble? Gentle winds That wait upon your Flours, purge, and refine them, And doing, what you please to misname Servile, At once conveigh Perfumes to them, and borrow A Tincture thence, which they had not before, Which makes 'em flie more gratefull: Can you thence Call those pure Blasts dishonourable? will you Think 'em vile Instruments, and Utensils, And rank them 'mongst the Pesantry of things? Common Opinion blinds you. What is this, But to unite good Qualities, and mix Two better Natures to the making of A third in each outshining both. To deal Thus with the Vertuous then, cannot be Service, But sweet Commerce: no Fate, or Force, but only Our free Election. More I could repay In a Comparison of this Condition, And yours; were it not so Ingenuous, As not to give Offence, though't be to those Who do provoke it. Leuc. Pray you bear me too. Those your dishonourable Offices, you please To fasten on her, are a double wrong: For you suppose that there is one so wanton As to enjoyn 'em, when you say there is One so ridiculously idle, as To busie her self in the performance of 'em. Pyl. The first thing I'll do, when I'm chosen Queen By that Judicious Tyrant, shall be to Pronounce both of you Traitouresses. Chry. Pray y' let The common thought of our ensuing Fate Compose this strife. It was an hard Decree Without our leaves to send our Pictures. I Have pray'd unto Diana, that I may Appear most ugly, and, me thoughts, the Image Did seem to grant, and bow'd. Leuc. Some chaster God Cast an unshapen Cloud before his Eyes, And make him loath, as soon as he shall see. Pyl. Come, come, y' are raw: you little think what 'tis To be a Tyrant's Consort. You may get This, or that head you hate, for every kisse. I would not clip him, unlesse 'twere to strangle Some one I was offended with. Be not So sad, I'l warrant you for being chosen. Our Picture's sent; 'tis I must be your Queen. Chry. I hope 'twill be your fortune, being you wish it. Pyl. Do you but hope? It must be so; you wrong us If that you are not sure on't. We will give you All Places in our Court: We will create New Offices; Elpidia, you shall be Lady o'th' Fan; You, Chryse, of the Colours; Leucasia, wiper of our Glasse; Euthalpe, If she repent, may keep our Mercury water. Some Grooms o'th' Teeth, and others of the hair; Mistres o'th' Fricace, one, one of the Powders, One ofâI know not what. Then there shall be A pair of Secretaries to the State For Love-Letters to Forrain Princes, for Whom we will found a Library, which shall Be only stor'd with Play-books, and Romances. Elp. 'Twould be a labour worthy of your Highnesse To bind the liquorish Courtiers to the Peace, As oft as we are drest for Masques and Playes. We cannot keep a Pleat unrumpled, or An Head-tire undisturb'd for them: what we Have been two days in building, in a minute Is ruin'd by their boisterous Foppery. Pyl. Wee'l call a Parliament of women, choose Burgesses out o'th' Matrons of the City: Then wee'l reform all that we think Abuses, Both Male and Female. Not a Courtier shall Dare to pretend to th' understanding of Ought else besides a Play; nor learn a Language Except it be in Fashion; write no Poetry, Unlesse it be an Anagram upon His Mistresses Name, or a thin Distich on Her little Spaniell. Then it shall be treason T'appear with a full Calf before the Ladies. No Lord shall be permitted then to trespasse A bed with 's Lady, but on Festivall Nights, If that he be an Impotent convicted. Women shall be allow'd to tempt and wooe: Especially if that the Man or is, Or else hath lately been a Student in Our Famous University of Athens. Lastly, no Lord shall Authorize a Fashion, It being a Prerogative, that wee'l Wholly reserve unto our self. I swell With Axioms, Methods, Rules; I have as strong A Modell in mine head of Reformation, As they that are most factiousâ Scen. III. To them Epigenes, Scedasus, Terpander. [Pyl.] âHow now Subjects. Epig. What? you expect to hear who 'tis that's chosen? Pyl. God bless you my good People; I perceive You're come to do us Homage: We are Queen. You hear the Tyrant's wonderfully taken With us: It was none of our seeking; Fortune Hath thrown the Dignity into our Lap. Wee'l make your Yoak hereafter very easie. Sced. How came your Mistris mad, Elpidia, thus? Elp. I'm Lady of the Fan Sir; That's my Title. Terp. Truly, good Mrs Tyrant, I'm glad on't, I hope you'l let's have Victuals cheap hereafter. What price hath your Mistris put on Eggs yet, Lady? Pyl. I'm studying now what Government is best; Which of the Species goes on surest Maxims: Democracy that runs int' Anarchy, And Aristocracy into Oligarchy; The Transmigration's Pythagoricall; I think the Common-wealth be best as 'tis. Well, fare you well: they're come to fetch me here; I must away with the Ambassadorsâ Scen. IV. To them Timophilus, Patacion, Nicias. [Pyl.] âHow fares the Partner of Our Throne, Misander? Tim. Most Noble Citizens, his Majesty Accepteth of your profer, and by me Demandeth one be sent that's nam'dâ Leu. O stay. Chr. O speak no further! Pyl. Speak it out aloud; We love to hear the Accent of our Name. Tim. He doth demand one nam'd Leucasia. Terp. O! good wife Pyle you're not Mistris Tyrant. Pyl. Come, come, you forge. Pat. Truth is, Leucasia's chosen. Nic. Ne'r grieve for't, we shall live as merry as they. Terp. Troth, Gammer Pyle, I did even think so. Now what you call'd your Throne 's a Wicker chair; Your Court's a Cottage, your Jewels two penny Beads. 'Twas, as you say, none of your seeking; Fortune, Fortune hath thrown the Dignity' int' your Lap. Pray y' make our Yoke hereafter very easie. Pyl. Are we not chosen then? I'l go and beat All my Maids o'r for this: he had as goodâ I'lâcome away, you baggageâwhat d'you gaze on You filthy Slut? Ex. Pyl. Elpi. Terp. B'w'y'Lady of the Fan. Now will she go and say her Prayers backward Thrice, and turn Witch to be reveng'd upon him. God save your Grace, Leucasia. Leu. O that word, That word Leucasia! I did ne'r mislike My Name till now: I'm odious to my self, 'Cause I thus please another. Must it be My punishment that some do call me fair? Must I place Beauty 'mong the Injuries Of spightfull Nature? did she only give it That there might not be wanting to our City One to enrage a Tyrant? Terp. Let me tell you: saving your Tyrantship, you are a Fool. A Tyrant's Concubine's a pretty thing. You may live well on't if you will your self. 'Tis well you have light upon this Fortune, e'r you are able to judge of a good Leg &amp; Foot. Good Lord to see! she had as fair a promising Table when she was in swadling-clouts as e'r I saw. As my Wife, her Nurse, was dressing her, come next Quinquatria, 'twill be just fifteen years, God bless the time! The Cat sate purring on the little stool, just in the Chimney corner I remember. Saies I unto my Wife Cyne! Ay saies she; This child Cyne will be alive when we are dead &amp; rotten! saies she to me again; the Child's a good Child Husband. Now see the luck on't; how things will come about! Don't cry Leucasia. Leu. No other destiny, O heav'ns, but this? Tim. These froward Plaints do but prolong your Bondage: You onely doe defer your Liberty, Grieving away that time should gain your freedome. Leuc. Seeing that I must go, pray let me be Conducted like a Sacrifice, for I Am Offer'd, not Bestow'd. It is my Death, (For so I think't) but given to my Countrey, And to divert from her a punishment. Though th' Means be ill, 'tis Vertue to consent. Exeunt. Scen. V. Prusias with the Picture of the Widdow, Callimachus and Philostratus after him. Prus. Stay Villain, or thou dyest. Amongst the throng Of more ignoble Creatures she might perish: Yet there's no other way of winning her. Call. Hee's at it in the very same strain. Prus. Goeâ Doe not,âWhy stir you not?âCome backâTo suffer Thus, Prusias, for that blest one, is the chief Of all thy Glories. Phil. Look, the Widdows Picture! Prus. I wonder his affection would permit His Art to shew it self in such a Peece. Could he gaze so long on as to pourtray, And have so little flame, as not to love? Cal. and Phil. step in. Cal. Yes verily I think he could. Must you Be doting on a Picture too? Pru. Take't hence. I have her here. Phil. Then thou'st a Fury there. Pru. O! I do feel something that is not Lust. Cal. In good troth so do I; a perfect hate. You are the Man for tender Maidenheadsâ Ph. âThat would not venture on a season'd Widdowâ Cal. âFor a whole Kingdom Sir. Prus. Say what you will. Phi. She is the verier Picture of the two. Cal. She hath as many Colours in her face, As that Board hath. Phi. Thou err'st to call 'em Colours. Cal. True! they turn Morter when th'are there. Pru. Say on, I'l suffer any thing. Phil. Shee'sâlet me seeâ Cal. An Hag, a Witch, a Fury, ne'r stick at it. Pru. Here, hold my Swordâgive't me againâshe hath A fair white skinâ Phi. âA mangy gross thick hide. Pru. Most Amber Tressesâ Cal. A most ugly Maine. Pru. Lips decent, and most fitâ Phil. To sweep a Mangerâ Cal. âWhich she doth open like a pair of Gatesâ Phi. âAnd then claps down her teeth like a Percullis. Pru. Neat Leg and Footâ Cal. Most durty Hocks, and Hoofs. Pru. Descended from some Kingâ Phi. Some antient Cart-horse. Pru. A sprightly Goddessâ Cal. A foule durty Beast. Pru. Her Eyes like Sunsâ Phi. âDraw vapours from her Breathâ Cal. âWhich in her Nose, as in the middle Regionâ Phi. âAre turn'd to ominous Comets. Pru.

Prethee Philostratus let me have none. Cal. âBetraies her Teeth, which stand one by another. Ph. âAs if that they were Cloves stuck in an Orenge. Cal. Joy, Prusias, Joy: though thou be strucken blindâ Phi. âThou yet canst see her Picture in thy Mind. Ex. severally. Scen. VI. Eudemus, Leucasia, Euthalpe. Eud. Ne'r murmur Girl, 't 's a Service to thy Country. Leu. There was this only wanting to my evils, That you too should approve; that, that good name (Father) should yet inserted be in this My vile disgrace. Call 't you a service to My Country, to turn Whore? What Brand will't be Unto your Liberty, when't shall be said 'Twas purchas'd by a Strumpet? Eud. 'Tis not thou Offend'st, but thine ill fortune, and the City: Rejoice that thou canst make the heavens guilty. Come, thou must love him Girl. Leu. Can I love him That thus will rob me of mine Honour? Eud. 'Tis His tenderness unto thee. Leu. If he be Thus tender, how's he cruell? sure his Hate Is something beyond Death, if he Love thus. Eud. Alas! thou know'st not how to value Fortune; What ever Nature of her own Accord, Or Art by force can yeeld, will all be thine. Leuc. But I shall lose mine Honour. Eud. Thou shalt have Th' Inventions of his Kingdome toyl to please thee; A strife of Wits and Fancies to content thee; And thou reward them amply by one smile: The Silkworm shall spin only to thy Wardrobe; The Sea yield Pearls unto thy Caskinet; Thou shalt come forth loaded with Jewels, like That Body with an hundred Eyes. Thou shalt Take Coach to the next door, and as it were An Expedition, not a Visit, be Bound for an house but ten strides off, still carry'd Aloof in indignation of the Earth. Five hundred Asses shall be daily milk'd To make a Bath for thee, which shall maintain Thy skin in an unblemish'd tendernesse, And make thine Age, in spight of Time, run back. Nature her self shall joy to be thy Slave. Leuc. But I shall lose mine Honour. Eud. Hast a mind To redeem that thou seem'st so tender of? Leuc. I am so far engag'd to my disgrace, That there's no means left for me to escape it; Shew me but any except Death, and I Will hearken to you with as much Religion, As to some Reverend Auncestor, when he In a shape more than Humane doth appear, And dictate holy Oracles in Dreams. Eud. The way, I'l shew thee, will preserve thy Life, And that Life of thy Country, Liberty. But thou'lt not do't I know. Leuc. Think not so ill Of your good Daughter. Eud. Thou shalt kill this Tyrant. Leuc. Heavens forbid! Eud. I did suppose as much. Goe, flye to his Embraces, there produce Monsters, and Plagues: from him and thee there cannot Spring any thing that's ord'nary in Nature. Leuc. Indeed I cannot kill him. Eud. When that he Shall loath thy foul embraces, and avoid Thy sight, as somthing that doth exprobrate His sins unto him: When thou shalt be so Unhappy, as to become fruitfull, and Discarded from his Bed, walk despicable, Loaded with spurious Brats, one in thy Bosome, Another on thy Back, the third i' thine Hand, Just like the Picture of Charity, thou'lt wish Too late, thou'dst took the Counsell of thy Father. Leuc. Indeed I'l kill my self, if that you will. Eud. O! nourish no such thought my good Leucasia. Take not to heart what I have said; my Passion Carry'd my Tongue beyond my thoughtsâButâGirleâ Come, thou shalt kill him, and be famous for't. Leuc. But will you help me then? Eud. Why I'm thy Father. Intreat that thou mayst come alone 'bout Midnight; Pretend thy Modesty wo'nt suffer thee To goe with solemn Pomp to thy disgrace: And when thou'st opportunity strike home. I will be ready when thou'st struck the blow To rescue thee from danger. Fear no stain: A Tyrant's Bloud doth wash the hand that spils it. Leuc. Alas, Euthalpe, how am I distracted! Ex. Eudem. Either I must turn Homicide, or Whore; And if I kill him, twill be said I did Kindle the Flame, and then put out the Man; If not, I kill my self; Shame waits on both; And I (O cruell!) have this only Freedome To choose the lesse offence. Euth. The straight is this, Either you must ruine th' Effect, or else Destroy the Cause; punish his Love, or lose Your Beauty by consenting. But Love is A strong desire of being united to That which is fair, by the most perfect means That Nature yeelds, or Reason teacheth. Hee's Deficient in the way then: Love is good Still in the Fountain, but offends i'th' stream. But this will not be weigh'd by Common thoughts; So that you will be said to punish him, Because your self were fair, and he had Eyes. Leuc. True, good Euthalpe; but yet put mine Honour Into the other Scale, which o'rweighs then? Euth. Love's common unto all the masse of Creatures, As Life and Breath; Honour to Man alone: And amongst Men ('yet narrower) to the Prudent. Honor being then 'bove Life, Dishonor must Be worse than Death: For Fate can strike but one, Reproach doth reach whole Families; and in Our Sex especiall, the chast Sphere of Vertue Being to us as proper as the Aire To winged Creatures Yet I cannot bid you Strike to avoid a blow. Some Virgins Daggers Have been deliver'd up to Fame by Penns; But yet there goes a stain along, in that Beauty could be so cruell. Leuc. Some good God [Soft Mus. awhile. Direct me in my Dreams! But heark! I hear The Musick sounds sad Accents, and the Virgins Are ready to conduct me; and I must Depart without thy wonted Resolution. Let me embrace thee yet; thou art no Tyrant. Farwell, Euthalpe, and when e'r thou shalt Hear mention of me, pay a sigh, and say, The Fate, if Bad, was not deserv'd. Euth. The Gods Leave me when e'r I dare be so ungratefull As to leave you. Some Pow'r may look down yet And help in pitty; we will tread one Path, Obey one Counsell, undergoe one Fate; And resolutely in this mutuall Tye, Either preserve our Honor, or else dye. Exeunt. [Soft Musick.] Scene VII. Leucasia with Euthalpe, and a Company of Virgins, and others of Byzantium, solemnly conducting her with this Song. 1 Virg. Strow we these Flowers as we goe, Which trod by thee will sweeter grow. 2 Virg. Guard her, ye Pow'rs, if any be, That love afflicted Chastity. 1 Virg.

All things are husht &amp; laid, except my thoughts; Somthing puls back my hand, methinks, and tels me 'Tis not a Virgin's Office to be cruell. I would that he were dead, but not by me. I am afraid. But do I only tremble? Is that all I retain of Innocence? Shee's too near guilt that only fears, and she That's come so far as only to be stopp'd By a misgiving Heart, hath don't already. I cannot then retire me from the sin, Though I do leave the Action unconsummate. On then, Leucasia, on: that Tyrant hath The same Design on thee, but that he will Put it in practise by an easier way. Prevent him then, andâwhat? I am afraid To hear it nam'd: I have decreed within me Somthing I dare not tell unto my self. And truly 't hath been told me, that there is A place, where after Death all sins are punish'd. There be my wrongs Reveng'dâBut wilt thou then Betray thine Honour to him, and bequeath Thy self to willing Infamy? Thy Deed Hath Heav'n for its Defence; thine Innocence Prompts thee to do it; it is Vertue strikes, The Blow is none of thineâYet some do say The Ghosts of those that are thus us'd do haunt The guilty after death, and I shall then Be frighted every minuteâBut thy Father, Thy Father doth perswade thee; 'tis not thou, It is Eudemus strikesâYet I shall never Endure to see his bloud gush out in streams: 'Twill be an hideous sight to view his wounds Open, and gaping as it were for her That newly made 'm. Can a Virgin this? A Virgin wrong'd can moreâBut I'm not safe; All things, methinks, have Eyes: this wavering Taper Doth seem to watch, and listen what I say, And trembles now to think what shall be done; It is a Spy; first then extinguish that. Darknesse belongs unto thy deed. Sin never Yet wanted light; there's somthing that directs it Without a Dayâgood Heav'n! how sound he sleeps! I cannot do it for my heartâ'Tis best That I retire unseenâ As she puts out the Light, he starts out of his sleep, and snatching a Dagger from under his Pillow, stabs her. Mis. So perish All that do seek my life. Leuc. O! O! Mis. When Kings Lye down, ev'n Darknesse doth become their Guard, And Night keeps watch. Misander's sleep hath Eyes. Lights here, what lights ho! [Phi. Cal. and Pru. with lights Leuc. O! Mis. Is't thee my fair one? (Quickly, a Surgeon ho! the hurt is mine: Haste; every drop of Bloud's your Soveraigne's.) Said I my sleep had Eyes! O, if it had, Thou ne'r hadst fall'n. This is a deed, that makes Ev'n me asham'd, one, who they say ne'r blusht, But only to cast out all Modesty. Be husht, O Fame, in this part of my Life! Oblivion, seize thou but this deed, and let me Become the talk of all Posterity. What e'r I did before was yet virile, Having this plea at least, that 'twas to Man. The Sex here is my shame, what shall I say The Beauty of it is? That makes mine Act Deform'd beyond expression: 'Tis a sin That puzzles all Invention to outstrip, And comes a Novelty to History. Leu. Why have you us'd her thus, that could not wound you? Mis. And art thou kind yet, fair Leucasia? I dare not call thee mine. My Act's more hainous In that thou still affect'st me, and thy Love Makes me more wicked than the wrong I've done thee. Thou hast found one way more t'augment my fault. Leuc. If I did please you, why am I thus wounded? If not, O why doe not you wound me more? If thus you use those whom you love, your Subjects Will make their pray'rs to heaven to be hated. [Ent. Phil. with a Surgeon.] Mis. Bind up her wound as tender as you can, And be as Gentle, as I have been Cruell. Here Health her self should come and work the Cure. Nature lyes sick whiles she doth. O my Fate! Y're idle O ye Gods! where is your Thunder?â Scen. II. To them Eudemus. Eud. Not far off from thee most unhumane Tyrant. Mis. I am a Tyrant now indeed; this stroke Hath made that Name peculiarly mine. Eud. Was't this she pleas'd thee for? she did deserve it In comming to thee. 'Tis a due that's paid her For that offence. But if I'd thought thou hadst Only requir'd her Bloud 't should have been spilt By me her Father, whiles she yet was honest, VVhiles not yet tainted with so near approach Unto this Crime, as to Consent. I'm only Sorry 'tis done so late. Mis. O do not think This Sin, this Villany, call't what thou wilt, Was done with Counsell; 'Twas a meer Mistake; Suspicion made me Cruell. Eud. Nay, I thank you, I thank you for the Wound: I'm glad her Body Hath only pleas'd to slaughter; you have been Past expectation kind in striking thus. The wound had been far greater had you lov'd her. Put this among your Deeds of Charity; It is the only thing in which the Father, Since thou didst first demand her, can rejoyce in. Mis. If yet thy Voice speak louder than thy Bloud Say this, Leucasia, onlyâ'Twas his Errorâ O take revenge, Eudemus, whiles thy Fury Yet prompts thine ArmâO speak, Leucasia, Curse me, Leucasia, so thou wilt but speakâ O pardon me, Eudemus, 'tis a King, A King thus asks thee pardonâBy those Eyes, Those Eyes, whose sight first Captivated mine, By this thy present Beauty, though thus wounded, Which makes me suppliant to thee, me, who do Acknowledge no Superiour, I entreat Thou think not ill of me howe'râBlest Father, Only unhappy by this Accident, Remit mine ErrorâSweetest Virgin look, Look once upon me, I've no Dagger now, No such curs'd weaponâIf thou yet dar'st trust Thy Daughter with me, all the helps that Art Can yield shall be employ'd; there shall no Prayers Be made to Heav'n but to recover her; No Gums shall fly up in a pious smoak But for her health, although the Gods I know Favour her so, that she ne'r yet had need T' employ a Sacrifice. Eud. Trust her with thee? I'l trust her to Destruction as soon. Give me my Daughter from thy loath'd Embraces. You have done what you would: yet shee's not mine, Whiles thus polluted by thy Love, and Anger. When thou hast made her honest, and has wrought That cure upon her, then return her to me. 'Tis only Innocence that makes the Child. Ex. Eud. Mis. Thou, unto whom I ow this curs'd misfortune, Darkness, enwrap me. Though mine Eyes are blest In viewing her, (too happy if not thus) Yet that they may no longer share this guilt, If thou canst hide one blacker than thy self, Spread out thy Wings; O Night I fly to thee, Strook deeper far, and wounded more than she.

This comes of Love forsoothâThey fool so long Untill at last they ev'n kill one another. The beastly Poets now will fall to work And stab her o'r and o'r again; we shall Have such Leucasiads now come forth I warrant, And such Misandriadsâ Pru. 'Twas no fault of his. He did suspect some Treachery, some design Upon his life; it was not meant to her. Phi. I would 't had been your Widdow, Prusias. Cal. Faith, cut her throat in imitation too. Phi. Sure you may do it safely; she hath no Bloud left that will be spilt; 'twill only make Another passage for her wind. Cal. You may When you have don't take her, and marry her In Recompence: Il warrant you shall find her As warm then, and as moist, as she is now. Pru. You never had that goodness, as to Love. Keep in your Scoffs, or elseâ Cal. âYou'l beat me, won't you? Pru. A man can't be a little Circumspect, And carefull of himself, but you must twit him With Cowardise. Sir, there's a King in Thrace. Cal. Why, th' King shall know we love him Sir as well As you, although we do not walk his Pace, Eate not according to his Palate, Love not, And hate not by Reflection. Phi. There may be True hearty Subjects, though they be not shadows Cast from the Body Royal; and we may Live very well, and yet not live by Rote. Pru. Pray y' be not angry friends: you know wee're Mortals: All have our faults. Phi. And thine is Cowardize. Why, now I see thou'rt coming: I perceive There is some goodness in thee. Let's speak Treason. Pru. Come, come, you're merry Captains: let m'alone; What think you of this Action? Cal. Though I don't Commend it, yet, I'm glad 'tis done. Pru. The King Shew'd himself truly valiant, me thinks, That he durst strike i'th' dark, he knew not whom. Phi. No question but 'twas valiantly done: Misander did it. Troth I like it well, There'l be some trading now. This sneaking Peace Stops all Commerce; a Man grows musty in't. There is no dying out of Course. Cal. Good faith, I do ev'n long to cut a Throat: good Qualities Are quickly lost, you know, for want of practice. To them a Souldier. Sol. The City's up in Arms: away t'your Tents. Cal. This is the first thing that I lov'd 'em for. Now you shall see the difference 'twixt us Captains Train'd up i'th' Field, and you train'd up i'th' Court. Phi. Let's to our charges; how will you bestow Your self most valiant Prusias? Pru. I'l along Unto the King, and do as he doth. Pray you For my sake spare the Widdowâfaith I love her. Exeunt. Scen. III. Misander on a Couch. Mis. Or Nature doth not make the Beautifull, Or takes no care for their defence once made. Where are those now say Beauty is a Guard Sufficient without Weapons? Curs'd Misander: Thou hast not that felicity of ill doing As to offend the Common way. Thou dost Act Crimes, that thwart receiv'd Opinions, And contradict ev'n Truths agreed upon; So that thy facts will be hereafter urg'd As Proofs against Positions. Wretched Man! If any shall hereafter strive t' express A Mortall Malice, let him only say, His Hate's as dangerous, as Misander's Love. Scen. IV. To him Cleodemus, Timophilus, Callimachus, Philostratus. Cle. Leave off this grief; The Citie's up in Arms Sirâ Mis. How does Leucasia? Tim. âThey're almost with usâ Phi. âTheir March is swift; Eudemus is their Captainâ Cal. âThey are resolv'd to kill, or to be kill'dâ Mis. Hath she not slept as yet? Cle. Do you sleep Sir? Tim. Are you in such a Lethargy, that Thunder Cannot awake you? Mis. Doth her wound much grieve her? Tim. You will be Butcher'd Sir within this half hour. Mis. Ha! Phil. You will have your throat cut presently. Mis. Ay! Cal. Pox upon this paltry nonsense Love. Will you be made a Martyr by your slaves? Mis. What is the matter Captain? Cal. Why, the City Is up in Arms, coming to kill you Sir. Mis. Let 'em do what they will. You have not told Whether Leucasia slept or no. Cle. Come Sir, On with this Sword; girt, and bestir your self. Mis. What would you have me do? Tim. Wee'd have you fight, Or else give us directions how we shall. Mis. I charge you make not any shew of Battel; Let there be no resistance; give 'em free And unmolested passage to me: all Is safe I'm sure, if that you'l be contented. He that shall first lift up his hand against 'em Shall be the first that falls. Cle. Then dye alone, And perish sluggishly without resistance. Tim. Come let's away, and each shift for himself. Exeunt all but Misander. Scen. V. To him a Boy in the habit of a Virgin. Leucasia discover'd in a Chair, and Euthalpe by her. Mis. I know, for my sake, that she hates all Men; Who're therfore Miserable 'cause she hates them. So that I've brought a Curse o'r half the world By this one single Action. Prethee sing, And try if in this habit thou canst wooe Her weary thoughts into a gentle slumber. Song. Boy. Seal up her Eyes, O Sleep, but flow Mild, as her Manners, too and fro: Slide soft into her, that yet shee May receive no wound from thee. And ye, present her thoughts, O Dreams, With hushing winds, and purling streams, Whiles hovering silence sits without, Carefull to keep disturbance out. Thus seize her, Sleep, thus her again resign, So what was Heavens gift, wee'l reckon thine. As she fals asleep Misander seats himself just over against her, and looks immoveably upon her, not regarding any thing done in the next Scene. Scen. VI. To them Eudemus, Terpander, Scedasus, Epigenes, Patacion, Nicias, Souldiers of Byzantium. The Attendants flie all but Euthalpe. The Byzantines seeing Misander sit thus, full off amaz'd. Sced. VVhat Policy is this and't please the Gods? Ter. The sign o'th'Tyrant gazing on the Virgin. Nic. Here's more work for my Pencill than my Sword. Eud. What? stand you fix'd as he? I thought there would Have been that loyall strife who should have first Let out that Bloud that covets yours. Epig. Shall we Fight with a Statue? Eud. Flesh and bloud I warrant y'. No part is stone about him, but his Heart. Through which, though hardned so, I'l find a Passage. Eud. makes at him. Euth. steps between. Eut. But through me first: the Sword hath more to do Than you suspect Eud. Will you dye too for Company? Eud. is stopt by Sced. and Pata. Euthalpes Father. Pat. passeth over to defend his Daughter. Pat. You are my Enemy if you wrong my Daughter. Euth. This is a part of Fury, not of Valour. Where heavy sadness hath quite tane away All life and Soul, will you add more wounds yet, And kill him that's already dead? you shall not Disgrace your former deeds with such an Action. Eud. What? a she Champion? Eut. That I am a woman Cannot take off from vertuous deeds; my Soul's As Male as yours; there's no Sex in the mind. Eud. New Tenents to defend new Prodigies. Was't this you went along for? Can you see him Gazing upon these Wounds he made, and yet Not give him one himself? Look how he takes Delight in's Act ev'n to an Extasie. Sced. Wee'l strike when he may feel it: 'twere an Act Of pitty to destroy him now; you see He takes no notice, and makes no resistance. Eud. 'Tis only Beauty moves his wanton Eye; Hee's blind to all besides. 'Tis not his time To strike as yet, his Blow's at Midnight still. Were't dark he would bestir himself; he dares Do nothing when 'tis day: besides wee're Men; He only shews his strength on feeble Virgins. Were we but Women all our Blouds should run Mixt in one common stream. You shall not stay me: I'l sacrifice him to my wronged Daughter, Whom he thus tortures. Euth. If that Love can torture He is her punishment: hee's so tender of her That he hath not once clos'd his Eyes, since first He wounded her, but sits thus musing still, Scarce breathing any time, except it be To set a sigh at liberty: he is Almost run Frantick for this hard mischance. Pat. You see, Eudemus, Heaven hath begun To take revenge upon him, doe not interest A mortall spight i'th' quarrell of the Gods. Leave them to perfect what they've took in hand. Terp. Ne'r let me eat more if I could not cry To see him how he looksâyfaith he loves her. Eud. Think you that this is out of tendernesse He thus takes care of her? he doth but strive To make her fit to fall again; she must Either endure his Anger, or his Lust The worse Plague of the two. If that you love her, Pray Heav'n she ne'r awake. Epig. You are too bitter; You have too much o'th' Father in you; 'tis Your Passion speaks. Eud. You are not Citizens, That think this Injury my private one; Not Souldiers, that let fall your swords, when that Y' are come unto the point of Action; Not Friends, in that you think 't my privat wrong, And yet not strive to vindicate me: 'tis Heaven's will my sword should only be ennobled In this Designe. I will perform'tâ Euth. You shall not. Pat. Keep off Eudemus. Eud. What Patacion turn'd Misander's Bawd? Euth. Most passionate Man, you wrong My Reverend Father, and your Daughter too; I'm certain his Love's good, Lust never yet Could look so quiet and so peaceable. Terp. Well, if it be a trick, he do's't as well As e'r I saw one yet: yfaith hee'd make A very pretty Actor in my Judgment. Perhaps 'tis but his Image, there have been Such tricks e'r now; pull him but by the Nose And we shall quickly seeâBut hold! who's here? Scen. VII. To them Timophilus, Cleodemus, Callimachus, Philostratus, Prusias, without weapons. Tim. Most Noble Citizens, 'tis very kindly Done of you, thus to visit your faire Virgin. Eud. Perhaps you think to complement us out Of our revenge; where are your Swords? your Weapons? Tim. There, in that Chair. Eud. This meerly is a Plot. Cle. I would Misander did dissemble only! Alas! the Passion is too true. I wrong it When that I call it Passion: 'tis a Madness, A Frensie rather. Would he lov'd us so As he doth you, Eudemus, and your Daughter. Eud. I would he did; I'm sure hee'd wound you then. Cle. Heaven can witness, that was his mistake: You must complain of Fortune, not of him. Tim. You would do very nobly to conclude A Truce between both parts till he recover. I'm sure it is not your desire to end The business of a Field in a Bedchamber. Pat. We can't suspect that Treachery can have A lodging in your Brest. Pru. To wipe off all Such thoughts, I am most willing to become Hostage my self. Cal., Phi. And we too if you please. Pat. If you'l consent, Eudemus, I my self, With Scedasus, and Epigenes, will be th' Exchange. Eud. Being you'l have it so, I will. Sced., Epig. And we. Cle. May from these pledges spring such setled Peace That we ne'r need these mutuall Offices For its Assuranceâ Pat. And our strength hence grow Weak to our selves, but potent to our Foe. Misand. desists his contemplation as Leuc. awakens. They depart enterchangeably. Manent Mis. Euth. Leuc. Mis. I am return'd again; I was transported, And drunk in Revelations from the sight Of your diviner Front. Me thoughts I saw Venus, impregnate at one beck of Jove, Deliver'd of a wing'd and star-like Infant; At whose blest Birth the Spheres sung high, and loud, And each thing else rejoyc'd; only a Soul There was, which striving to destroy the Child Presented it a Mixture made of Tears, And Sighs, and Passions, instead of Nectar. For this condemn'd to take it all her self, She drank it, and grew Mad: Being thus distracted, The Father of the World, and Love (that was The little Infant) did forthwith confine her Unto the Prison of an humane Body; And only left her this way to regain Her former Seat, by using the Child well. Euth. Be your own Tutor then; Dyet that Child With pure and simple Viandes; let no Passion Trouble the Cup; or if some one slip in, Purge and correct it, that it only give A pleasing relish to the rest, and thence Prove an Encitement only, no Disease. Mis. Alas! you talk of streams fresh from the chaste Resplendent Gravell of the purer Fountain. The waters that I taste have journi'd through All Minerals, and have stoln somewhat from each; Straying as far in Qualities from the Fountain As they've in space. Euth. The Eye of Love, like that O'th' Body, if distemper'd, is to be Help'd by the Influx of some harmless Color. If then your Soul see ill (for that 's Love's Eye) Cure it, by looking on her healing Vertues. Mis. True, I must take those good Perfections Only from her; I am my self as void Of all, as Tables not yet lineate, And only love to gain 'em. Euth. You love them In a desire of supplement. Mis. Had Heav'n Given me all th' Endowments of my Saint, I should rejoice as much in mine own Beauties As now I sigh for hers. To love her would Be a superfluous thing, my self sufficing My self, as once Narcissus did Narcissus. Eut. You seem to stray Sir from the Common Tenent That Woman is but the defect of Man, In that you make her thus his Complement. Mis. And rightly: 'Tis she gives him operation. Her Beauty 'tis that's Valorous, Liberall, Just: Our Vertues only are but other Names Of her Perfections; some good thing of hers Disguis'd i'th' shape of Action. Thus at first The Servant hath not that great Light and Beauty Of better thoughts, that his blest Fair one hath; But by conversing, and Example, grows Up to the same vigor and force of honour; As the weak Taper that is kindled from The fuller light, shews first a fainter Beam, But by the eager growth of Flames, casts forth A Lustre still encreasing, till both, being At the same measur'd brightness, do combine, And twist by intermingled Beams, uniting Themselves into one Circular flux of Glories. Leu. Who hath inspir'd you thus? me thinks that mind Which ere while like the place below the Moon Had Thunders, Lightnings, Whirlwinds, and such other Unruly Meteors, is now like the State Of that above, where still one equall Calm, One soft continued Quietness doth hush All that wheels round about it, making things Pass without Noise, and yet with Musick too. Had you but ere while shewn such mildness, you Had wounded my Soul then. Mis. Unworthy Wretch! By your instructions yet that name may be Chang'd to a Title equalling ev'n Heav'n. Speak, and I'l listen as some holy Priest To the high Dictates of his whispering God. Leu. Thus then, Love, whether he be found i'th' Fields 'Mong Beasts (where some think he was born, and as He grew up practiz'd shooting upon them) Or else 'mong Laws, and Men (where now his Temples, His Altars, and his Statutes are) is alwaies Each where a thing Divine, and ought as such Be worship'd by all that pretend to good. Love having this Divinity in us Far above other Creatures, in that he Hath chosen out Man's Countenance to place Two sparks of it, whence Hearts are easily kindled, Man ought to cherish this fire by good Reason, And make it burn more cleer, substracting from it All grosser stuff: I banish not the Senses When I name Reason; for as we must please The Mind and Soul, so we must feed the Sight, And sometimes too the Touch; in that we are Not Reason only, but Eye too, and Hand. Mis. I do acknowledge all as Oracle, Let me adore those Lips that utter'd it. Leuc. This doth not yet give way to your Embrace, Or Authorize your Kiss: think not of any Such thing, lest like the impatient Orpheus, you By looking back lose what yo' have gain'd from Death. You are not yet arriv'd at that perfection As to participate those Sweets; your Merits Must grow up to them: to transgress their bounds Would be to wrong your self; for disproportion'd Felicity, is a Misery. First, conceive And think, and Fancy honourably within, And then take leave t' embrace, &amp; Crown those thoughts. For they that love a Lip or Hand, love grosly: Affection compasseth, not enters them; Having, as th' Earth, the Surface scorch'd by th'Sun, Whiles that the Center rests cold and benum'd. Beasts and Plants move to propagate their like; Our Love must then step higher, and contend To make our selves Immortall: which is done When each by dying in himself doth come To live in something made of both these Deaths, As doth the Voice and Lute in a third Musik, Or Musk and Amber in a third Perfume. And this the Gods and we call perfect Love. Mis. One Voice is Heav'n's and yours: now I perceive That as the Earth enlightned by the Sun Sends forth those fumes which after darken him; So our Hearts kindled by our Reason first Cloud the serenity of that by strange And grosser Appetites. But you have drawn The Veyl away that was before Love's Eyes. Which Veyl yet was not his, but ours, he being Said to want Eyes, because we walk in Secret, And unknown Paths. Great Diety of Affections, Thou art first fair and good thy self, and then Mak'st others to be so. O pardon us Blasphemers then, who do the Blame transfer; And say that thou art blind, because we Err. Exeunt.</field>

I know you've got the Widdows promise Captain. Phi. No doubt she gave it you, you did so whisper. Cal. Good faith I spoke for thee most heartily. I told her all thy Parts. Phi. Troth now and then I intermingled thy good Qualities too. All that I did was honest; as I live I ask'd her not the Question all the while. Cal. I'l lay thee a brace of hundreds then shee's mine. Phi. Win her and wear her then, catch he that can. Exeunt. Scen. II. Pyle, and Prusias. Pyl. You have no hopes then to be King? Pru. My Title Is but infirm to th' Crown, All the bloud Royall That I have in me came by sucking of His Majesties finger when he cut it once. But for Nobility I've all the Signs of 't. Pyl. You rate your looks, perhaps, have faces of All prizes, pay your debts with Countenance: Put off your Mercer with your Fee-buck for That season, and so forth; and then you write Your Name in Characters that must be sent About to the Professors, to discover What Language they belong to: All, I take it, Most certain Symptoms that y'are sick of Greatness. Pru. I count your Judgment, Lady, most Authentick. Pyl. Next, you are poor and needy, having been So long a Courtier; you do spend your Pension In oyntment for your Beard; by which cost when You are arriv'd at th' easie Chambermaid, You task your sharp Invention, to find out A passage to her Lady, with as much Care and Anxiety, as another would To find a way beyond th' Herculean Pillars. Prus. Your Ladiship, though young, speaks like a Sibyll. Pyl. That you may see I cannot Prophesie, I must demand a subtle question of you. What was the time that you began to love in? Prus. My Love's Eternall; it did ne'r begin: Tis not a thing subject to Generation. Pyl. I do not like it then. Prus. I know, and't please you, The very instant; June the thirty one, The Sun in's ApogÃ¦um, Moon in Libra, First Quartile, Minutes twenty three, two Seconds, Late in the Afternoon. Pyl. What? you'r a Scholar. Prus. My Scholarship is at your service, Lady. I'l make fine Anagrams upon your Name, Or on your Dogg's; I'l give you a True-Love's Knot In endlesse Verse; ask Questions of my Lute In a most melting Tone, and make that ask Questions of me again, and all in Honour To your fair Self. Pyl. I've vow'd against all Scholars, They ne'r come near to Kings, but when they have A sullen fit o' Philosophy come upon 'em. Prus. I hate a Scholar, I protest, as I Do the sharp Visage of my craving Taylor At Quarter-day: that which I spoke ev'n now, I conn'd out of an Almanack; I'm only A Philomath, sweet Lady. Pyl. I am all For deeds of Prowesse. Prus. Now you come to me. Pyl. What Squadrons do you lead besides your Creditors? What Troups, but eager and despairing Tradesmen? How many Towns, pray y', are you wont to take 'Twixt first and second Course? What Castles do y' Demolish, besides Pye-crusts? What great Breaches Do y' make, and sally in, whiles that you pick Your Ebony Teeth? then when you have bely'd Old Captive Matrons suing t' y', how many Young tender Virgins do you there deflowre In eating of the other slice of Marmalad? Prus. Your Ladiship hath a good grace in Mirth; Your Jests do wear as new a dresse, as any. I had a Feather quite struck off my Helmet I'th' Tilt yard once. Sweetest of Ladyes, speak, Hath any one abus'd you? Pyl. Yes, the King: Dare you assault him? Prus. For a world I would not Offer to violate his Sacred Body, Who is intended for your Loyall Husband. Pyl. There are a brace of Captains here i'th' City, Your Fellow-Hostages; I've suffer'd wrong From them too, they'r below the Throne I'm sure. Prus. In Words, or Deeds? Pyl. Only in Words, that's all? Prus. Fare-you-well Lady, they shall hear of it. I'l go and rayl at 'em most heartily. [Exit Prusias. Pyl. I do beleeve your heart is in your Mouth, Both wayes.

If you'l preserve the Liberty of your City, There is a way now profer'd you: Misander Desires your Daughter. Eud. Very likely Sir, He hath a mind to wound her once again. 'Tis as the Sea looks smooth upon the Shipwrack'd, He doth entice but for a second Booty. Tim. 'Tis in the way of Marriage, honestly: That he may make amends for this his wrong. Eud. Joyn her to him? I'l joyn her first unto A lustfull Satyr; I am sure the knot Will be more innocent. Cleo. You do mistake: His Flames are now as chaste, as erewhile foul. Hee's carefull of Succession. Eud. Heav'n avert The Prodigy! A Tyrant, and love honesty? Doth the great Rank and Line of Nephews now Present it self to his Ambition? I'l give her to my Slave first. Sced. Do not thwart The publike good with a particular spleen. Pat. Hear Reason, good Eudemus. Eud. Will you speak it? Pat. It is not his Sute only, 'tis ours too; Your City asks it; there's a greater good Preparing for us than your Anger sees. Do not provoke those Evils, that are now About to settle. Eud. If he hath a mind to't, I'l condiscend on this Condition Hee'l promise hee'l not kill her the next Morning. Tim. That should be buried now. Eud. Do what you will, My Title's least unto her now shee's publike. Cleo. 'Twill be the more by losing of her thus. Tim.

You'd make a fitter Queen by far than she. Pyl. Nature, 'tis true, intended us for Queen; And 'tis her wrong, not ours, that wee're neglected. Eud. I'd willingly promote your Cause, if that I knew but how; he hath done you more wrong By his Refusall, than he hath my Daughter By's Cruelty. I wonder you'r so slack: Do you not dream of your Revenge? doth not Your sleep each Night prompt you to right your Self? And ev'n that prove watchfull? Pyl. Alas! I Have no Accesse; my Hate knows not to Reach him. I might betray my Self by trying it, Shewing an idle fruitlesse spight, and make A Noise, not knowing where my sting might enter. Eud. Will you assist me with your Secresie And help, fair Pyle? Pyl. Any thing, Eudemus, Loving Eudemus, any thing. Eud. You shall Procure a trifle only, I'l apply it; Somthing to kill a Rat, or some such Vermin. Pyl.

I've wash'd my face in Mercury water, for A year and upwards; lain in Oyl'd Gloves still; Worn my Pomatum'd Masks all night; each morning Rang'd every Hair in its due rank and Posture; Laid red amongst the white; writ o'r my face, And set it forth in a most fair Edition; Worn a thin Tiffeny only o'r my Breasts; Kept Musk-plums in my Mouth continually; Yet have not had one bite at all these baits, But a poor single-sol'd thin meager Footman, One that I could see through. I think I shall Be sav'd by my Virginity, whether I will or no, and lead an Ape in Heav'n. Here she comes now with one of her Fopperies. [Elpid. retires. Scen. VI. Pylo, Philostratus. Pyl.

Than throwing of the Sledg, or Jumping well. Pyl. But Poets never yet prov'd vertuous Husbands. Pru. To please you then, I will speak only grave Sad Morall Sentences; cough sager Proverbs; And live your Yoakfellow in City Prose.

And it will be one comfort to my Fate, If none b' advanc'd whom I may emulate. Exit. Scen. X. Leucasia with the Potion in a Glass. Leu. I'm hurri'd still, and yet I know not whither, But I am hurri'dâO distracted thoughts! Eudemus urgeth Poyson, but I love. Is this a Fathers gift? and to be drank, Before we go t'our Nuptials, that those Souls Which should be join'd, may be divorc'd for ever? 'Twas meant for good Misander, but I'l drink it. I have a thirst that's Loyall. My death will Make no more alteration, than the adding Of one neglected Marble to the Number Of unregarded Sepulchers. His Fate May draw the Veines of all the Kingdom dry, And I commit a slaughter in one Person. Drink then Leucasia; let it not be said In after Histories that any ruine Of a Republick ow'd it self to thee. She drinks. So! now I am in health, and out of danger. No Father now can urge. Ye Pow'rs who look Upon th' Affections of those Hearts you wound, How e're I fall, be you Misanders stay: Wounded by him I cur'd his lawlesse Passions, And by a better way did slay the Tyrant. Some Virgin, who shall be so blest, as to Enjoy his virtues, will perhaps for this Sprinkle a flower or two upon my grave, And wish me Rest. No tongue can blast my Name With just Reproach, when after times shall know, That I, who when his Love was drossie, wou'd Have wrought his death, dy'd for him when twas' good. Exit.</field>

VVith what Contrivance, and Deliberation Am I become a Parricide? whiles that I seek to quit her from a Tyrant, I Am proved one my self, one worse than he; In that I'm Cruell out of Tendernesse. Is this to save thine Honour my Leucasia, To take away thy Life? I would I had Yeelded thee up without all tumult, then Th' hadst liv'd at least. Now I desire thy Guilt. Curs'd be that Fury that I dealt withâ Scen. II. To him Pyle. Pyl. Come, Make haste; conduct m', Eudemus; sleeps Misander? Hath he drunk deep and largely? Eud. Hatefull Woman! If thou hast any poison here about thee Beside thy malice, doe one deed of Charity, Infuse it into me: Shew here the vigor Of that thy damned Art. Vile Sorceresse! Look me to death: for every glance of thine Should carry Fate with it. Thou'rt slack, when that Thou shouldst bestow it where it is deserv'd. 'Twas ready to destroy an innocent Virgin. Pyl. What? hath Leucasia dranke it then? Eud. I'm sorry Thou liv'st to aske the question, that thou dost not Augment the number of the Furies, comming A Plague ev'n unto them. Pyl. Be not so passionate, My good Eudemus; take my Counsell with you, If that your Daughter hath drank it her self, Remove all Company from her whatsoever. Let not Misander see her for a world. I will secure her life: it will not work To death, these two days yet: I've that will cure her. Eud. Sweet Pyle pardon what my rage hath scatter'd: I have not leisure now t'excuse my Fury. For Heavens sake along with me unto her. Exeunt. Scen. III. Leucasia discover'd sleeping, Misander, Cleodemus, Timophilus, Patacion, Scedasus, Epigenes, Terpander, Euthalpe. Mis. Is it still death if I begin to love? Euth. And can I live if she begin to dye? To tear mine hair is Womanish; to forerun And lead the way t' Elyzium but a duty She would not thank me for: if that some God, Envious of honest fires, hath destin'd ruine Unto this fairer Altar where they burn, I'l see it be demolish'd decently, And then my self fall the last Sacrifice. Mis. Call for some Musick one of you; perhaps That may infuse a Peace into her Senses: Her Soul, I'm sure, 's awake. I would this kiss Could suck out all the Poyson that torments thee. Euth. Hold! have you so forgot her sacred Dictates? There is more Reverence due unto her Fate. Had you gone so far now as to embrace, Love would have told her in the other world, And so your Spirits had been divorc'd for ever. Mis. Pardon, Euthalpe; Grief transported me. Why do not Plants desert their Native soyl? And powerfull Herbs put on new Motion, coming Unforc'd unto her help? Nature, thou shouldst Be factious to restore her: I accuse thee; Where are thy Vertues? where thy remedies now? Terp. 'Twere good to knock an Horseshoe on the Threshold; 'T may be that Mother Pyle hath bewitch'd her: Truly she looks as if she were be what led. Mis.

Softly, O softly, Boy! Song. Boy. See how the Emulous Gods do watch Which of them first her Breath shall catch, Ambitious to resign their Bliss, Might they but feed on Aire like this. Thus here protected she doth lie Hedg'd with a Ring of Majesty. And doth make Heaven all her own; Never more safe, than when alone. Thus whiles she sleeps Gods do descend, and kiss: They lend all other Breath, but borrow this. Scen. IV. To them Pyle, Eudemus. Pyl. Make room for heaven's sake; pray y' quit the Place. What, will you stifle her with this Multitude? Mis. Thunder it self shall not remove me hence. [Leucasia awakens and casts her Eye on Misander.] Leuc. O! who disturbs the quiet of my Soul? I'd been by this time at Elysium Had none molested me. But I am glad I am call'd back, being that I here enjoy A pleasure far beyond all those below, In only viewing you. Mis. Canst thou behold Him that did wound thee, and approve the sight? Leuc. It is a favour to me that you would Take so much notice of me. I am not Worthy of any thing that comes from you. 'T had been too great a Blessing to me, if Y' had only lov'd me without seasoning That Happinesse with some Castigation For my intruding boldnesse. I am blest, In that I was once in those sacred Thoughts, Which make all worthy that they think upon. Mis. By what good Pow'r art thou so sudden chang'd? Blest be the hand that laid thee in this sleep. Terp. I beleeve now, and't please your Majesty, This Widdow ne'r had ought to do with her. Pyl. The Art was mine: her Father here came to me, And urging me to take Revenge upon you, Intreated me to help him to a Poyson, Which this Leucasia here was to have giv'n you. I, carefull of your safety, gave him somthing Which I call'd Poyson: but 'twas only an Essence Whose Vertue was to cast him that should take it Into a sleep, and make him fall in Love With the first Object that should offer it self Unto him, as he wak'd; thinking indeed, Because I lov'd you, to present my self. But envious Fates have cross'd my fair Intents, And turn'd my means unto anothers Ends, Leucasia drinking it her self: which yet Out of your Princely Grace you may correct. Eud. Th' hast done thou know'st not what: it is prov'd Poyson, In that she dotes on him. Mis. O would some God Would make thee sleep too, to the same effect. Is it too great a blessing to my Scepter To have the love of good Eudemus too? Eud. Of good Eudemus? how can I deserve This Imputation? for I count all praise From thee Aspersion. Leuc. My most honour'd Father, Think not so ill of blest Misander: for I see him like a vigorous spark among Things tumbling in the Common night o'th' world; Sent to make that we call a Pilgrimage Deserve the name of life: without him, 'twere Onely to stand without doors, till it pleas'd The Gods to call us in. Mis. Fairest of things, And only like thy self, those pleasures, which The laden bosom of this lower world Permits to carefull Mortalls, are too grosse, Too earthy to be ours: Let's mount the wings Of our desires, and take a flight into Nature's sincerer Kingdome, where she mints And shapes refin'd delights, delights like thee. Leuc. Wee'll to those places set a part for Love, Where Trees like Trees, and Branch embraceth Branch; Poplar to Poplar whispers there, and Myrtle Doth sigh to Myrtle. Flow'rs erect themselves, And Boughs encline to meet 'em in salutes With an unquestion'd freedome; no stalk being Made yellow there by jealousie, no Tree With'ring through sad suspition, that this Flower Doth court that Bough, or that Bough serve this Flower. Mis. O! these are joys fresh from the Dugs of Nature. There some Plants shew th'have fire ev'n in their Colors: Some Dialogues make; and some more passionate grieve; Sweet Odors are their sighes; and Dew their teares. Some Leaves, they say, have words of woe inscrib'd, As if that Flowers writ mutuall Letters too. Our ancient Love-Priests say, that in that Garden A Rose and Lilly (to whose sacred leaves The neighboring Flowers do reverence) mingle Roots In a most streight embrace, and thence produce Male Roses blanch'd with th' whiteness of the Lilly, And Female Lillies dipt i'th' blush o'th' Rose; Each borrowing others Beauty so, that 'tis Thought Natures Prophecie of some future times, Which shall fulfill it, and be happy. Leuc. As 'T hath types of things to come, so too 'tis said That Ancient Stories are cut there in Trees; And the mysterious Hedges are the Annals Of former Ages: Thus each thing containing Something that may be read, doth make the whole But one fair Volume to instruct blest Souls. Mis. Among those pleasures we shall walk, and see Here some Girl twisting of her Lovers locks, Weaving, what caught her heart, into a Net; There others making Dialogues with sighs In a sad Parly; these from richer Banks, here Culling out Flow'rs, which in a learned order Do become Characters, whence they disclose Their mutuall meaning, Garlands there and Nosegaies Being fram'd into Epistles; yonder he Watching his sleeping Lady, doth protect her From Rivall Lyzards, and such loving Creatures, And with a Bough of Myrtle guards her slumbers, Lest the Bee should mistake her Beauteous Cheeks: Others perhaps in a dissembled anger Pursue their Coyer Loves, who at each turn Fling Violets in their Faces, thus maintaining Soft Love-rights, like the Parthian, who yet flie, Not to escape, but to be caught. Leuc. And we When we come there, what chaster pleasures shall we Indulge to our Affections? Mis. Thou shalt sit Queen of that Kingdom in a Chair of Light, And Doves with ointed wings shall hover o'r thee, Shedding Perfumes, as if blest Nature reign'd Delights, and powr'd 'em on our tender Loves To make 'em flourish: fresh, and well tun'd winds Shall bring thee Viands in, and at each change Of Service, alter their respectfull Musick. Fountains shall walk upon thy Table, and Birds singing to the fall of their soft waters Shall by the Marriage of their mingled sounds Create an Harmony shall make Syrens sleep. Thence rising thou shalt walk, and view young Nymphs In Currents gravell'd with transparent Amber, Breaking their shapes at every step: thy self Outshining both the Currents, and them too. Then shalt thou sail in one entire rich Shell Through Labyrinths of waters, whose perplex'd And interwoven Banks shall be environ'd With shady Trees charg'd with delightfull fruits, Nature there making one continued Season. Leu. O! I am ravish'd with delight, and could Live on the very thought: but all those joyes Must, like a Morning Cloud pass into nought; My incensed Father not permitting me To enjoy you, who are your self all these. Mis. Consider, good Eudemus, do not nip These buddings of our Souls: thou art that wall That stands between our Hearts, let them but meet, But meet, Eudemus, and the wheel of things Shall turn another way; all that you shall Complain of shall be only too much Joy. All things shall flow according to your mind, And yet before your wishes: when I do not Prevent the earlinesse of your Desires (Not staying so long as to meet 'm) say They come too late, Misander is grown tardy. Eud. I will not dash these hopes. Be she then yours: And be she fruitfull in her Vertues first, Then in her Issue; that she may bring forth Heirs to your Mind, as well as to your Throne. Mis. Thy Prayers must be heard; she is the only Cause, that all Worth goes not upwards; Earth Whiles it containeth her, hath somthing, which The Heav'ns themselves adore. Let's to the Temple, Which will be more a Temple, she being there: [Exeunt as to the Temple. Pyl. I'm slighted then? I would 't had been true poison. [Exit Pyle. Scen. V.

I have not seen the inside of a Temple These twelve Months til this time, &amp; now I come Commanded too: Hell's in this damned Widdow. What doth she mean to make me lye in a Coffin? I am not fit for Death, although I think I'm very forward towards it: Somthing in My Bones doth tell me so. But let that passe. If Death should go to claim me now, I were In a sweet case, he had eleven Points O'th' Law, on's side, Possession. It would mad me To lye Perdue i'th' Grave for a Womans pleasure. Well, 't must be done: here lye Philostratus: Enter a Coffin, to obtain a Carkasse. [He shuts himself in the Coffin. Scen. VI. Prusias drest like an Angell with a Caduceus in one hand, and a Taper in the other. Prus. Thou art an Angell, Prusias, therfore fit To be receiv'd into her heav'nly Bosome. She shapes thee in an Habit, that she'l wed thee. Truly, I think all Courtiers would be Angels, If that they were not giv'n so much to th'flesh, That keeps e'm all from Heav'n. But why should I Be set to guard a Coffin. If there doe Any ill Spirits use to haunt this Temple, The Coffin must defend it self for Prusias. This Rod yet, and this Candle have some Vertue To fright away those Children of the Night. Securely then I'l sit. What need I fear? he sets himself down on the Coffin. Death is already under me. Heav'n blesse me! I do begin to sweat; this Coffin rumbleth. The Body's somthing noysome: 'tis a stale one; Good troth it spurgeth very monstruously. Scene VII. Nicias slinks in, and placeth himself as behind a Pillar to take the sight; Callimachus after him dress'd as a Fury. Call. VVell! a Male Fiend is fit for a She Fury; Like must to like; so I unto this Widdow. If any of my Coat should come and take Acquaintance of me for a reall Fiend, And find me tripping, I've no other way But just to swear him down I am a true one That haveâ(let's see)âlain Leiger in the Indies, And so perhaps am grown out of his knowledge. I wonder who 'tis that shee'l have me carry Away i'th' Coffin: Sure some nasty Raskall. Nic. Lord! how my hand doth shake. I set down one thing, Then blot it out again I know not how. Pray Jove he doth not sent me! If he hath But any Nose, he hath th' Advantage of me. Pru. Heav'n bless me! Yonder's one I'm sure's no Angel. O my prophetick words! that I should promise T'encounter with a Fury! Cal. Hold! yond's something That is not one of us: I would I were A very Fury now indeed, and had All qualities belonging to my shape. The first thing that I'd do, should be to make My self invisible. Widdow, you must pardon me; Sure I shall fall into a Thousand peeces If that this shaking leave me not the sooner. I vow I'm not afraid for all my foolingâ IâIâmust onâ Pru. Good heaven! hee's coming towards me: How blew my Candle burns! I see his feet, Th'are cloven ones for certain. Cal. Yâyâyet I dare notâ 'Tis safest to retire, my joints are loose all, And yet I can scarce move 'em. Nic. He hath found me, He is upon the Train: how his Nose shakes As he snuffs up the Ayre! Cal. My Teeth do châchâchâchatter As Schoolboys in cold weather. Pru. Heav'n defend me! How he doth gnash his Teeth, and make hell here! I would I were i'th' Coffin at a Venture. Nic. All my left side's grown stupid. I'm half stone; I feel a numness steal o'r all my limbs: I shall augment the number of the Statues. It will be Niobe Nicias presently. Cal. Being it is an Angel, 'twill not hurt me. I will make towards it however. Pru. Now, Now he comes open-mouth'd; Lord, what a smoak He belcheth like a Furnace! look! he claps His tail between his Legs, as dogs are wont When they will do shrewd turns; 'tis a sly Spirit; They'l never leave their cunning. Cal. Hee'l not suffer me To talk long with him, hee's so us'd t' Ambrosia, And to's Perfumes, which hee'l not find here sure. Pru. O!â Cal. O!â Pru. Youâ Cal. Youâ Pru. Your Honourâ Cal. Blessed Spiritâ Pru. Yesâ Cal. Iâmust haveâthatâBodyâthere. Pru. You canâ Lay no claimeâunto himâhe is notâyoursâ Cal. He is our due. Pru. How can you prove't? Cal. Dare you Dispute with him that first invented Logick? Pru. No, no, I am no Scholar, I'm a Captain. Cal. You must not guard the dead then, he must down. Philostratus rising out of the Coffin, casts off Prusias, and frights 'em all; they disperse themselves to severall Places; he running out is met by Misander and the rest, who come to celebrate the Marriage there. Phi. I am not he you come for, you're mistaken. Cal. Hoh! Scen. VIII. Misander, Leucasia, Chryse, Euthalpe, Priest, Eudemus, Timophilus, Cleodemus, Patacion, Epigenes, Scedasus, Terpander. Mis. Must there be something still to cross our joys? What is the matter here? Phi. A Fury, a Fury! Yonder he slinks. Cal. And 't please your Majesty I am no Fury, I'm a Captain, one They call Callimachus by daylight Sir; The Angel Sir, the Angel! Pru. I'm the Angell, Your Majesties Court-Captain you made last. Mis. Speak, what device is this? Terp. An Antick only Prepar'd to grace your Marriage night, that hath Mistook the place of entrance. Mis. Are you dumb? Terp. Angels may speak. Phi. The Widdow Sir I thinkâ Terp. Captain you should not speak, you are a Ghost. Phi. That damned Widdow hath abus'd us all. Terp. If she be damn'd, then she is yours grim Spirit. Phi. They call her Pyle; I confess I made A little Love t'her, and profess'd I would Do any thing that shee'd command me, where- Upon she set me to turn Ghost, and lye All night i'th' Coffin there. I think that hee's Her Angel tooâ Terp. (Hee's her Angel.) Phil. âAnd he her Fury. Pru. She transform'd me truly. Cal. The trick was wholly hers. Terp. She is in sight, And looks on yonder. Eud. Go, and fetch her hither. Mis. Who's that behind the Pillar? Nic. Nicias Sir; He that did draw the Virgins. Pyle charg'd me, As I did hope to marry her, that I should Take all I saw this night here, and present her With it betimes i'th' Morning. Eud. Are you all Sutors unto her then? Cal. We do pretend I'th' way of love; shee's wealthy. Phi. But she hath sworn To marry me. Pru. Me. Cal. Me Sir; you're deceiv'd. Mis. How's that? to marry y' all? Terp. Gramercy Widdow! Seeing thou canst not have the King himself, Thou wilt have all his Subjects. [Enter Pyle and Elpidia.] Mis. With what state And pomp she stalks it? Terp. This is she I told Your Majesty I thought o'rlook'd Leucasia. If you will let one of your Captains search her, Hee'l find a Teat about her. Eud. 'Cause you have Abus'd these People in this sort, that did Out of Affection visit you, we charge you To take your choice out of 'em: if they will Agree, 't shall be your punishment. Cal., Phil. We do. Nic., Pru. With all our Hearts. Pyl. Well then, come forth, stand fair, Let's see your faces all. First, Nicias, you Being a Painter can create a Wife With a few Colours whensoe'r you please. I've sworn against all daubers. Elp. Please y' once He bid me put y' in mind of 's promising Nose, And his long Foot. Pyl. But for your former service, And being a Town-born Child, I care not if I join you to my Chambermaid. Pru. Mark her Eye, Mark but her Eye Philostratus, just on me. I'm sure I am the Man. Pyl. For you, good Captain, You are a Ghost, your winding sheet forbids The tumbling in the Marriage one: 'tis said, Let's live and love; the dead can claim no share. Pru. I told you so; mark but her Eye Callimachus. Just upon me still. Pyl. Worthy Captain, I Honour your Vertues and your Courage; but Heav'n bless me from a Fiend; give me a Man, A Man at least, nothing with cloven feet, No Incubus; when I'm a Fury, claim me. Terp. Be rul'd by me, and take her at her word. Pru. Come my most constant Heart: (your Majesty And I do sympathize most strangely in Our Fortunes, that we should both of's be married Just at one very instant.) Speak the word. Pyl. I do admire the Excellence of Angels; They are to be ador'd. Pru. Thy love will serve. Pyl. 'Twere an unequall mixture for vile Earth To join with Heav'n. Besides, I have heard say That Angels have no Sex, I'l none of him. Marriage respecteth Procreation. Pru. And 't please your Majesty she is a Traytor; She would have had me kill you. Mis. We then confine you To Vesta's Temple, there to wait upon The Virgins, and ne'r joyn in Wedlock more. Pyl. Although that Continence enjoyn'd, be only A Death without the Pomp of shedding bloud; Or at the best an holy Persecution; Yet I would willingly embrace the doom, But that I've vow'd my faith to Nicias. You won't adjudge me to a sin that may Draw heav'ns revenge on you, as well as me? Nic. (Pox o' your Craftiness) I humbly beg That you'd remit her faults, and give her me As a reward of my late Services. Eud. Thou ask'st a Torment, not a Gift; thou hast her. Come, joyn those hands, Sebaster, that Religion May perfect what Affection hath begun. The Priest sings. Be thou Hymen present here, And ye O Marriage Gods, whoe'r: Whiles I joyn these parts, joyn you such, As know to meet without a touch. Euth. We may not let this happy union pass Without solemnity; 'tis no dishonour To your great Valours, if you let a Siedge End in a Dance. Mis. Although the only thing I would deny you, be the honouring of me, Yet for my good Leucasia's sake, to whom What e'r sounds joy and mirth is due, I will Sit a Spectator, and think what is done A Sacrifice of thanks to Heav'n for her. They being all set, a Curtain being drawn discovers five valiant Generals standing in severall Postures, with fix'd Eyes like Statues. Mis. Whose shapes are those? Euth. They are the Statues Sir Of five Commanders, the stout Hercules, And he that trod his footsteps, the sage Theseus, The next there Pyrrhus, and Atrides that, The outmost great Achilles. They continuing all this while in the Posture they first appear'd in, the Priest thus sings. Priest. Awake out of this senseless trance, And grace these Nuptials with a Dance. Grow pliant O ye Marbles, Love Is able to make Statues move. The Priest having ended this Song, the Statues by the stealth of a slow Motion, do by little and little as it were assume life; and descending from their Pedestals walk about the Stage in a grave sad March to Trumpets, with their severall weapons in their hands, the Curtain in the mean time shutting: But making at last toward their former station, the Curtain flies aside, and they find five Ladies on their Pedestalls, in the Posture of Amorous Statues; at whose feet they having laid their weapons, conduct them down, and fall into a sprightly dance to Violins, and so depart. Euth. This only is the outward part o'th' feast: The joyfull'st Dance is that you do not see. Each Heart doth move as did those Bodies; were you Spectator there a while, you would perceive A full solemnity outshining this. Mis. This was of your Contrivance, fair Euthalpe. Y' have giv'n your Sex their due: Woman was born To rule, and therefore each might justly change Her Warriour int' a Lover, nay, each one Change the whole five; for as they ought to rule, So ought they to admit of many Servants, As Kings do Subjects to encrease their Soveraignty. Euth. You shew a soul most capable of Rule, In that you thus will part with't to the weaker. Mis. Nature compels me: 'tis the good man's Office To serve and reverence Woman, as it is The fire's to burn: for as our Souls consist Of Sense and Reason, so do yours, more noble, Of Sense and Love; which doth as easily calm All your desires, as Reason quiets ours. Euth. Some say we are Irrationall, and place us 'Mong Beasts, but you now carry us up too high. Mis. Pardon the Vulgar, for they understand not, Thinking that, where there is not Reason, there The Composition's meerly Sensuall, When that the difference is grand between Being Irrationall, and working without Reason, The former making Brute Beasts, but the latter Agreeing to refin'd Intelligences; 'Mong which great Love is one, perhaps the Chief. Love then doth work in you, what Reason doth Perform in us; here only lies the difference, Ours wait the lingring steps of Age, and years, But th' Woman's Soul is ripe when it is young, So that in us what we call learning, is Divinity in you, whose operations, Impatient of delay, do outstrip time. Euth. You make us Sir veyl'd Goddesses, not Mortals. Mis. True! saw you not the Worthies there, though wise And try'd, and Valiant; yet one clouded with An Aged Beard, another wrincled, All Subject to change and variation, when Their Ladies, all of one bright constant clearnesse, Smooth to the last Breath, stood immutable as Some heav'nly thing, which Grace you carry up Unto that place from whence you do descend To make Men happy. But, no more, lest I Be thought to flatter by the undiscerning. Who was that Lady, Euthalpe, that subjected The Great Achilles so? Euth. It was Briseis, One of mine own Condition, an Attendant. Mis. Thou dost renew her honour'd Memory More in thy merits far, than that Presentment. Leu. Sir, she hath been my Cabinet, my Tablet In which I've writ my weightiest secrets; still As faithful, and as silent too, as that: And (if you prize such an unworthy purchase) One, whom you owe Leucasia to. Mis. Fair Virgin, If that my Kingdom hath a Soul that is Worthy to meet with thine, I'l search him out, And beg thee to accept him. Euth. 'Tis reward Enough for me to see you happy thus, There being no content in which I can More rest, than viewing your joyn'd Excellencies. Mis. Now we are one, my fair Leucasia; Made dearer to each other by our dangers; This Marriage sha'n't be single, I will joyn Another Consort to thee. This knot shall Strengthen both Equity, and Love, combine My Throne, and Heart; and so one Tye shall be My Marriage to Byzantium, and to Thee. FINIS.</field>
