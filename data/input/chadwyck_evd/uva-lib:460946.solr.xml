      <field name="fulltext">THE THREE TEMPTATIONS. A Masque for the Moderns, NOVEL, ALLEGORICAL, MUSICAL, AND SPECTACULAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. POSSIBLES. King Arthur, once King of England, now a subject of Burlesque. Sir Lionel, Knight of the Silver Shield. Sir Tristam, his rival, Knight of the Brazen Mug. Sir Agrovaine, of the Rueful Countenance. Bruno, a servant. La Belle Isonde, daughter of Sir Agrovaine. IMPOSSIBLES. Merlin, the Enchanter. Morgana La Faye, the Welsh fairie. The Phantom Bill, a dangerous fiend. Druids, some enchanting young ladies, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene I. Banqueting-hall in the Palace of King Arthur, Pendragon Castle. The Round Table in foreground, with dessert, wine, &amp;c. King Arthur in C., surrounded by his Knights. Sir Tristram at table O.P.; Sir Lionel on couch P.S. Servitors in attendance with goblets, &amp;c. The whole scene as lively, picturesque, and convivial as possible. Opening Chorus: Air, âWho's for Calais?â Who's for a bumper? the glasses are ready now, Fill to the brim with the liquor divine; The table, that feels on its legs so unsteady now, Still, like the king, can stand plenty of wine. Laughing and chaffing and copiously quaffing, From pleasures like these who on earth would refrain? For Cupid's sad heartache that we from his dart take There is not a balm like a glass of champagne. [Rattle of applause on table. King A. Forsooth, a pleasant ditty!âPale or red? The pale, I think, Sir Lionel, you said. [Sends round sherry by Page. Sir L. I rather think you knights are getting âfast;â To this complexion I shall come at last. [Page fills his goblet. King A. Come, gentlemen, get onânay, never spare it; I've in my cellar got some famous claret. [Aloud] John, Thomas, hereâagainst all France I bet itâ We want some claret, [aside to Page] but you needn't get it. In the mean time here's portâjust from the wood. Sir L. A âlogâ before it âmakes its title good.â King A. Come, come, Sir Lionel, won't you join our sports? Sir L. I'm out of what's denominated âsorts.â You really must excuse meâstrange, but trueâ I'm quite fatigued through having naught to do. Sir T. To cure ennui we on adventures go. Sir L. But peradventure there should be noneâno! The great art now, as modern statesmen view it, Is, when there's aught to do, how not to do it. I've seen enough of wonders, and want leisure. King A. Then perhaps you'll tell us what you've seen? Sir L. With pleasure! [Sir Lionel advances to the front. The rest gather in groups around him. Song: Air, âUnfortunate Miss Bailey.â Sir. L. Let others sing of heroes bold in war who have been victorious, Of heroes who each year rose up till they were heroes glorious; Of wondrous stories they had heard they gave you superfluities; Now I'll sing of what I've seen myself, and then you'll know how true it is. Chorus. O, Sir Lionel! wonderful Sir Lionel! No one ever wonders saw like wonderful Sir Lionel! Sir L. I've seen a man, though for the act no doubt he soon was sorrowing, Who actually returned a new umbrella he'd been borrowing. And once I saw a chap who thought our palace parliamentary Would be completedâfancy that!âwithin the present century. [Chorus: O, Sir Lionel, &amp;c. I've seen a lady shopping, whoâI stake my honour on it, sirâ Resisted all temptation in the shape of a new bonnet, sir; And found a draper's shopman who of conscience had a particle, And served without inquiring, âNow, marm, what is the next article?â [Chorus: O, Sir Lionel, &amp;c. Now, though it seems incredible, it's truth what I declare to yeâ I've seen the cabman who would charge no more than was his fare to ye; I've had a house by contract built that wasn't very tottery, And got the prize I raffled for once in a Margate lottery. [Chorus: O, Sir Lionel, &amp;c. Now thisâthe last that I shall tellâmay make the city teachableâ I've seen a country gentleman whose word is unimpeachable, Who says when in a hurry that he takes a cab incessantly From Ludgate-hill to London-bridge, and gets along quite pleasantly. [Chorus: O, Sir Lionel, &amp;c. King A. Remarkable indeed! Each verse so pat, What shall we say, Sir Lionel, after that? Sir L. Than our old toast I cannot give a bettererâ Here's âMay the present moment beââ et cetera. King A. Here's may the present momentâ [Enter Bruno. Ha, you guffin! You've spoilt our toast, you wretched rag o'muffin! Bruno. Pardon, my liegeâmy master waits without; I pledge my wordâ King A. Enough! you needn't spout. [Bruno ushers in Sir Agrovaine melodramatically mournful. Sir T. [aside] Ha, Agrovaine! He here? This grows romantic. Sir A. Your pardon, friendsâexcuse my being frantic. King A. O, on no ceremony stand a bit. Sir A. I won't; so with your gracious leave I'll sit. Just hear my story, and then judge my woe. [Chairs arranged melodramatically in front. It must be nearly eighteen years ago Since first my child, to comfort future years, Burst like a sunbeam on this vale of tearsâ Sir L. [aside] He grows poeticalâa fearful sign. Sir A. I need not say that sunbeam bright was mine. I watched her infant form grow day by dayâ Sir L. [aside] And whipped it very often, I dare say. Sir A. Saw with delight her youth to beauty growâ Sir L. Your story's plain enough. Of course we know You had her photographed by some one who did âThis styleâone shillingâframe and glass included.â Sir A. Alas, some villain, backed by wizard's strength, Went in a âbust,â and took the whole full length; And here I am to ask some cunning file To free La Belle Isonde from durance vile. Sir L. [aside] La Belle Isonde, who turned my head with glee. Sir T. [aside] La Belle Isonde, on whom I turned the key. Sir L. [aside] Whom I adore beyond all words can tell. Sir T. [aside] On whom a door I bolted too as well. I must conceal the interest I take. Sir L. [aside] Upon this hint at rest my head I'll make. King A. Yours is a case, my friend, that's hard indeed; Your long account of settling stands in need. I don't fight now myself, that's very true; But then I know some gentlemen who do. Sir L. Nay, seek no farther, but behold one here In love and war alike a volunteer. King A. 'Tis bravely said. Sir L. And shall be bravely done. I like the fair, and don't dislike the fun. No door shall keep her, if her dress but lies Within the modern fashionable size. Sir A. It must be nearly eighteen years ago Since first my childâ Sir L. Of course, you told us so. But where's the lady? Sir A. Fenced by magic spells, Within the Castle Dolorous she dwells. King A. That castle's well known in this principality. Sir L. I hope they are not improving that locality; For places with new streets and building-ground Are not just now so easy to be found. Sir A. It must be nearlyâ King A. Ah, yes, that's about it. Sir A. Eighteen years ago. Sir L. I do not doubt it. I shall astonish him as he deserves. Sir T. [aside] Perhaps he won't astonish your weak nerves. Sir L. By laws of chivalry his head is forfeit. Sir T. [aside] You first have got to take his body off it. Sir L. I'll dress his joints with sauce piquant. Sir T. Pshaw! Sirrah, You may find sauce, but I'll supply a sorcerer. Quartette and Chorus: Air, âOff she goes.â Sir L. Think no more of the danger run, Consider it just the same as done; In me you behold what some folks call A nice young man for a party small. King A. I really don't like you to go at the price. Sir T. Here's an alarming sacrifice! Sir L. I'm warranted fast! Sir T. But the colours have ran With all who've encountered this terrible man. Chorus. Off to the castle away he goes; He can't mistake, if he follows his nose; But only think of the danger ran, With such a remarkably terrible man! King A. The thought of such valour expands my heart; Take a bit of cold something before you start. Sir T. A taste of cold steel he will have if he go. King A. Wouldn't you rather? Don't say no. Sir L. As for your daughter, fear me not. Sir A. It must be nearlyâ Sir L. Never mind what. The monster shall find that at last he's matched. Sir T. Don't reckon your chickens before they are hatched. [Chorus: Off to the castle, &amp;c. [At the termination of chorus King Arthur, Sir Lionel, and Sir Agrovaine retire up stage with the other Knights, whilst Sir Tristram goes off at side menacingly, when scene closes in upon group.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene II. Stonehenge by sunset, and Merlin's cave. Inscription over entrance, âA Lodge of the Ancient Druids. Meeting every Monday night.â Enter, to âHaydn's Surprise,â four Druids separately. They each give three knocks at caveâto music. With the last Merlin appears, comes forward mysteriously, and sings. Song: Air, âMistletoe-bough.â Mer. The mistletoe hangs in the place where it should, And the wine, boys, to-night is uncommonly good; And some capital fellows are joking away, And keeping it up in a style rather gay. Whilst some, who will sing every song that they know, Soon under the table will speedily go; So from this you may fancy how far I am right When I say that the âDruidsâ are jolly to-night. O, the mistletoe row! O, the mistletoe row! Mer. You know the wayâthe old roomâah, that's it! [Exeunt Druids. O, ain't they going it above a bit! Our noble vice to give advice ain't able, And those who've passed the chair can't pass the table. Enter Druid. Druid. The Noble Grand's required. [Exit. Mer. Ha, ha! ifegs! The Noble Grand is glad to stretch his legs. Enter Sir Tristram. Sir T. All's quiet. Ha! Who's that? Mer. Some knave, I fear. It's a Lodge night, my friend; you can't lodge here. Sir T. What, Merlin! Mer. Tristram! Ha, how don't you do? Why, who'd have ever thought of seeing you? Sir T. Your gait's unsteady, and your style is rough. Mer. I must confess I think I've had enough. Sir T. I've come on pressing business you to tease. [Shaking hands. Mer. Pressing indeed, if judging by your squeeze. Sir T. You aided me a maiden to entrapâ Mer. You want her carried back again, mayhap? Sir T. Not so. But this another strives to do. Mer. But you're not going to let him do it? Pooh! Your castle keeps the knight in check. Sir T. The same; But then that castle will not win the game. Small obstacles won't stop him. Mer. For preventance Just put a full-stop then, and close his sentence. Sir T. That's just the very thing which I'd do now But for one drawbackâthat's, I don't know how. Mer. You're a nice individual, you areâvery; It's very well for you I'm rather merry. Our compact shall be kept. But here's a metaphor You could, or would, or should be all the better for. Sir T. Go onâyour wisdom well becomes your age. Mer. We always stuff a goose with what is sage. Enter Druid. Druid. The Noble Grand has his health drunk once more. [Exit Druid. Mer. The Noble Grand has been drunk once before. Listen: you've doubtless seen at village fair Three prizes poised upon three sticks with care; Whilst here a box, and there a bell is heard, A tempting pincushion will crown the third. The man invites, and thrice the staves you throw; With dextrous aim you give each stick a blow; But down successive as in holes they fall, Nor box, nor bell, nor cushion's gained at all. So thus sink hopes that never more may rise; You lose your patience, and you gain no prize. Sir T. But what's this fable got to do with me? Mer. Moralâahem!âThe stick yourself must be. One shy you've hadâthis is the second blow; The third you're mine, and that's your overthrow. Sir T. I'll shy at everything, let him but fall. But perhaps I tire you? Mer. Dear, no; not at all. With two temptations I'll his road assail: The first is Wine; and then, if that should fail, Woman shall come and tempt him with her flattery; I'll charge him with a full gal-vanic battery. Sir T. Delightful! Mer. Eh? Sir T. I mean delightful plan. Mer. I thought perhaps you'd like to be the man. Sir T. He cannot both escape; it's plain indeed, If wine comes first, the second must succeed. Mer. You're satisfied? Sir T. I am. Mer. Then in we'll dodge; It's a grand night with this our ancient lodge. Sir T. I'm an odd fellow. Mer. Very, I'm afraid; But if you'd like to be a Druid made, I'll make you one. Sir T. No red-hot poker? Mer. Honour! Entranceâa guinea frees the noble donor. Duet: Air, âAll's well.â Merlin and Sir Tristram. Diverted by this whining spoon, Who tries to claim a knight's own boon, Where sherry, port, or tent is found, Of century corks we'll take the round. And should our footsteps haply stray Where tall policemen guard the way, âWho goes there? your name and business tell;â âJohn Smith;â the fine, five shillings. Ah, all's well! [Exeunt into cavern lodge. Scene closes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene III. The Attic of Sir Lionel on the third floor back. Enter Sir Lionel, speaking as he enters. Sir L. Of wardrobe large I am not one to brag, Just pop a cleanâhem!âin my carpet-bag, And I'll be off. Ah, me! it's very true, We single men have double work to do. Husbands no flying cords need ever chase, Wives plead the best in every packing-case; Whilst luckless bachelors their baggage cram In one confused inextricable jam. Ah, me! as with life's stream I vainly tussle, I long to be a âfloat,â like Henry Russell. Morgan La Faye, half fairy, half Welsh peasant, appears. Morg. Not as a float, but as a buoy, you speak. Sir L. Do boards give way? Morg. Yes, when they spring a leak. Hur need not mind, hur has not yet forsook you. Sir L. A sprite! odd rabbit! Morg. Yes, a Welsh one, look you. Sir L. A Cambrian fairy! This is something new. To quote a popular author, âWho are you?â Song: âJenny Jones.â Morg. My name's La Faye Morgan, I live in Llangollen, I'm sent to protect those whom Merlin assails; I know every castle and vale in the mountains, And also know all the great mountains in Wales. So, if you will follow, look you, my directions, I'll bring you at once to the place where you'd rove; For 'deed, goodness knows, I detest that old Merlin, And aiding a knight is a task that I love. Sir L. But how to get there I should now be told. Morg. Hur thus will point the nearest way. Behold! [Waves wand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene IV. Scene changes to the Goblin Glade in the Wood of Wonders. Sir L. Here's a near-cut indeed, and these petitioners Of woods and forests doubtless are commissioners. Morg. Just so. Sir L. Ah, ours have no such rapid movements; 'Twould take with them ten years for such improvements. Morg. There runs your path, and here my power must stay; Hur must alone now venture on hur way. Sir L. But give you no advice ere this I try; Morg. Avoid temptation and bad company. [Exit Morgan. Sir L. The first to be resisted must be shown; The second we hope never here to own. Solo: âThrough the wood.â Sir L. Through the wood, through the wood, looking behind me, I'll loudly hollo for aid in the dell; He must be the prince of pedestrians who'd find me, For she whom I seek shall be sought after well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene V. A dangerous path in the forest of Temptation. Enter Merlin (as Comus), Sir Tristram, and Attendants with drinking-horns. Mer. Ha! ha! if this don't make my man sing small, He's not the one I take him for, that's all; Dare he oppose my will, I'll make him rue it. Sir T. It's very well to talk, but who's to do it? Mer. Why, I am, to be sure! Here's Milton's domus. Sir T. But p'raps he'll brush us ere he comes to Comus. Mer. One glass of wine destroys him as he passes. Sir T. He'd be a spectacle with two such glasses. He's close at hand. Mer. Then our hands we'll keep close; This youth shall find our mixture proves a dose.â Begone, ye slaves! there's leave of absence granted; But mind, like trumps, you turn up when you're wanted. [Exeunt Bacchanals. Mer. Now, lest he take us for a pair of noddies, In garments quaint we'll robe our precious bodies. Sir T. Play your cards well. Mer. Don't fear; I'm rather cute. Sir T. You take the lead, then; and I'll follow suit. [Exeunt. Enter Sir Lionel. Sir L. So far no tempter yet has aught attempted. P'raps, though called out, from serving I'm exempted. I wonder which direction I should follow? I'd shout, but here's already a view hollow; Where none can hear, it must be vain to bellow. Enter Merlin and Sir Tristram as two Medical Students. Mer. Hail, friend! well met! Sir T. Well met, and so hail fellow! Sir L. Medical students! Mer. Yes, does that surprise? Sir T. Bartholemew's. Sir L. I took you both for Guy's. Sir T. [to Mer.] Our guise is vain; he knows us. Mer. [to Sir T.] But by sight. Ahem! Where go you at this time of night? Sir L. To free a captive I'm this toil incurring. Mer. Pooh! you're a spoon at this time to keep stirring. Sir T. Some friend has just got into quod, no doubt And you're the spoon that's going to bail him out. Sir L. Not so; although my friendly mettle's active, At present there's a âmetal more attractive.â Mer. Ho, ho, a damsel! Ah, these sad mishaps! Love plays the deuce with us fine handsome chaps. Sir T. To meet with us, though, you're a lucky dog: What say you to a social glass of grog? Sir L. This hospitality suggests a doubt. Mer. Ha! what d'ye say? The night is cold without, Have some âwarm with.ââHere, waiter, gin warm. Sir L. Humming! Voice without as Waiter. A go of gin, sir? Yezzir. Warm, sir? Coming. [A glass of gin-and-water appears in Merlin's hand. Mer. Don't be afraid of it, there's plenty more; Ay, twenty glassesâhere I run a score. Sir L. [aside] It's tempting, but to drink would now be folly. Sir T. What, won't you? Well, you are green, though not jolly. Mer. 'Tis now the witching hour of night, d'ye see? When life begins with those who love a spree; When gaslights beam and London sparks, being wise, Enjoy the lark with which your yokels rise; When pittites round each theatre's entrance cluster, And half-price visitors their shillings muster; When down the Strand smart gents who throng Pall Mall, Freed from the counter, counterfeit the swell; Whenâbut take all in one expressive line, 'Tis pleasure's hour, and that hour half-past nine. Sir L. Bless me, you're quite a guide-book; yes indeed, ye are A metropolitan encyclopÃ¦dia. But I'm inflexibleâthere lies my track, And I go towards it. Mer. This, then, brings you back! [Merlin raises wand, and Revellers enter. This is the sort of thing for jovial lads, Who take out latch-keys and forsake their dads! Come, join our sports. Sir T. Of course, he's in the right of it. This is what we call âlife;â so make a night of it! Drink! you should leave no drop within the can. Sir L. I drink as much as doth become a man; Who drinketh more is none. Sir T. Then take the cue. Sir L. I have already taken it from you. Mer. What, neither punch nor billiards? Sir L. Not a drop. You never know exactly where to stop. Mer. Pooh! you're a coward. Sir L. Ha! I've half a mindâ O, aid me, genius of the fairy kind, And by your power let me now be shielded. [Morgana La Faye appears. Mer. Confusion! Thwarted! Sir T. Just, too, as he yielded! Morg. Beware! refrain! These are delusions all, Snares into which most youths are apt to fall; Experience, oft too dearly bought, I task Thy power these cheats and juggles to unmask. I'll strip this pageant of its ideality, And show what follows is the sad reality. Music. Morgana La Faye waves her wand, a monumental Tablet rises, inscribed with âHeadaches; ruined fortunes; broken homes.â As Merlin and Tristram rush at Morgana, her fairy troop appear and interpose. Group.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene VI. A very great Waste indeed. Enter Sir Tristram. Sir T. âTo be, or not to beââthat's none so dusty, Although the imitation's somewhat musty. But is it nobler in the mind to suffer The bondage of this necromantic buffer, Or, with this Gordian knot of mystery, whether, Like Alexander, cut it altogether? I'm in a fix! Enter Merlin. Mer. Then fix the fix on me, And I'll unfix the fix in which you be. Sir T. Foul fiend, avaunt! Mer. Ha, ha! When they have won him, Folks seek the tempter, and then try to shun him. By far, too far, you've gone my aid to spurn; You may go on, but never can return. Sir T. Never! Mer. Not never!âit would spoil the moral. Sir T. Won't a duet, then, best convey a quarrel? Duet: Air, âDashing white Sergeant.â Sir T. Had I a conjuror wot wouldn't go, To serve a friend, a mile or so, I wouldn't in the gallery Disburse a sixpence him to see. Mer. It's very well to talk thus big; But I'll make you tremble, dash my wig! Hey, presto, cockalorum jig, Et cetera! Both. For where's there a conjuror wot wouldn't go, To serve a friend, a mile or so, With such a prize at last to show As he's gained already? Mer. Although you missed your second shy, I couldn't help itâno, not I. The chances are with all things prime; We may have better luck next time. Sir T. Then, on this final scheme intent, With such a hope I am content; And what I said I never meant, Et cetera. Both. For where's there the conjuror wot wouldn't go, To serve a friend, a mile or so, When such a prize he has to show As he's gained already? Mer. Advice imparted in a popular strain Isâ Sir T. Hush! break off! See where he stalks again. Mer. Then, that the Knight his mission may forego, Our second bait of woman now we'll throw. But surplus cooks the broth would spoil, you see; So step aside, and yield this task to me. Sir T. Enough! To you I'll leave the rest, and try For once to rest among the leaves close by. If he resist those black eyes here, of course You will supply some from another source. [Exit. Mer. Then now to lull suspicion. Garments, hence!â Here is an outfit at the least expense! [His druidical robes fly off, and he appears as Gamekeeper. Enter Sir Lionel. Sir L. This road's a dreary one, I must confessâ Ha! Who's our friend here in the sporting dress? He knows the road, perhaps.âHo, there! I say, How far to Castle Dolorous is it, pray? Mer. I'm not a milestone. Sir L. That I can suppose; You keep the distance that the other shows. But tell me, runs this road through yonder copse? Mer. It don't run nowhereâwhere it is it stops. Sir L. Sharp, short, and crusty! Mer. Just what those deserve Who try to jam themselves in this preserve. All poachers here we pack off in a trice hence. Sir L. You're sporting with me! Mer. Where's your sporting license? Song: Air, âRose of Lucerne.â Mer. I'm cross, as you may see, For in this land there's danger; Such games won't do for me, For I'm the head-ranger. Of hares I take care, and protect From the stranger; Then be a better boy, Or my blows you'll discern. Sir L. I know no game, save that of me you make; In fact, you're lyingâunder a mistake. I'm but a traveller. Mer. One who tales can weave Marines may hear, but sailors won't believe. Sir L. No, on my word. Mer. That's quite another thing. You to the Castle Dolorous I'll bring. [Aside] I think I've got him this time. Sir L. Is it near? Mer. Why, much too far for you to go, I fear. Sir L. It's dreary, very! Mer. Ay, but when you're near, You'll find more beauties than at first appear. A miss is equal to a mileâthat knowing, I'll show you now the miles you'll miss in going. [Merlin leads Sir Lionel into centre of stage, and a number of Young Ladies appear. Sir L. Gracious, what beauty! Mer. Ah, I thought you'd stare. Sir L. No prospect ever have I seen so fair. What eyes! Mer. [aside] He's mine! Sir L. What grace! Mer. He can't resist. Sir L. These lips eclipse all lips that e'er were kissed! Mer. The scenery here has some delightful features. Sir L. Enchanting forms! Mer. Yes, they're enchanting creatures! Sir L. I must confess this beauty charms my mind. Mer. [aside] Then you're in Castle Indolence confined. Sir L. Yet what are these to me? Mer. Ha! Sir L. At the best, One constant heart's worth more than all the rest. Loving but one, these tempters tempt in vain; They gain a loss. Mer. And I have lost again!â Girls, to the rescue! Bring your shields in action, On which this youth will find each great attraction. [Each Young Lady brings from the side a shield severally inscribed, âDances,â âPlays,â âSpeaks French,â âKnows Italian,â âWorks Berlin-wool,â âSings divinely,â âMakes puddings,â &amp;c. They arrange themselves with the above in front. Sir L. Each fitted to adorn some loftier station; But such self-praise needs little commendation. Morgana La Faye appears. Mer. My hated rival! Morg. Ay, thus learn from me The meaning true of every shield you see. [Each shield is turned towards the audience, and the inscriptions change to ââMiss Application,â âMiss Apprehension,â âMiss Behaviour,â âMiss Chance,â âMiss Chief,â âMiss Demeanour,â âMiss Fortune,â âMiss Hap,â âMiss Leading,â âMiss Management,â âMiss Representation,â âMiss Rule.â Morg. These are the misses that through life betray. In every pause there's danger; hence, away! This vain delusion hath deceived your eyesâ The place you seek, behold, before you lies! Sir L. A thousand thanks! Mer. I here feel rather small. What, ho, my fiery dragon! One and all, Be witness; here I swear to have revenge. My name is MerlinââNumber 1 Stonehenge!â [Young Ladies disappear. Exeunt Morgana La Faye and Sir Lionel. Enter Sir Tristram. Sir T. I wonder what has come of Merlin's tricks! The fabled cat that traversed burning bricks Felt much as I do. In suspense I keep, As one who, venturing on a Derby sweep, Pays for a chance in preference to a dinner, And wonders whether he has drawn the winner! [Letter flies down wire into Sir Tristram's hand. Hollo! what have we here? The postmark, âSkyââ It's Merlin's handânow then for his reply. [Reads] âAll's up! I'm off!ââMy head in rage is whirlin'.â âP.S. You're booked, and will be called for.âMerlin.â No hope! Confusion! Love and vengeance baffled, As hopeless both as though at Margate raffled. Duped, diddled, done for, still I will not flinch! No! I'll dispute possession inch by inch! He comes!âNow, fiend of fearful form and power, Before who's sight the boldest man will cower, I summon thee this stripling to destroy! Dost hear me? [Gruff Voice without] I believe you, my b-boy! Enter Sir Lionel. Sir L. Now yield, or else thy wretched life I take! Sir T. Never! You've got a conquest yet to make. Appear, thou fiend of Whitecross, home of debtorsâ Ensnare this victim in thy crushing fetters! [Sir Tristram goes through scene, and Fiend appears through it. The face represents a paper kiteâthe body like that of a spider, and a kind of train of written paper falls from back. The shield is a Government stamp. Sir L. What horrid monster crosses now my track? A spider's body, and a paper back, Inscribed with many names in various hands! Explain, what fearful form before me stands? Fiend. I never stand, but like a racehorse runâ I'm âAn Accommodation Bill,â just done! Touch me, you're lostâfriends, homes, and hearts I sunder. Come on! Sir L. I will, with one, two, three, and under! [Combat; the Fiend overthrown. Fiend. Stop! you're invulnerable; I cry peccavi! I cannot raise the wind, I'll take my Davy. Sir L. Away, then, vile destroyer! Fiend. Ah, I'm sure, Once taken up, you'll never see me more. [Fiend sinks through trap. Sir L. âUnreal mockery, hence!â Now, fiendish elf, The trap for others set you've found yourself. What farther trial? Morgana La Faye and La Belle Isonde appear through scene. Morg. None, this is your last; Through life's temptations have you nobly past. With this achievement all your perils cease, And here's the prize from thraldom you release! Sir L. [embracing Isonde] A rich reward indeed for what I've done! Morg. Take her; she's yours, and has been bravely won. Sir L. My love alone must testify my joy. Morg. And now this airy fabric I'll destroy. As virtue's meed, behold the friends you miss In thisâthe Haven of Domestic Bliss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene VII. Allegorical picturesque scene representing the Haven of Domestic Bliss. Small cottage festooned with woodbine on cliff. The bay, studded with fairy-like vessels, bounded by the range of hills beyond. Sir L. This is indeed the land of sylph and fay! Morg. Here will your life serenely glide away, Blest as temptations overcome can make it. Sir L. And that's our moral, if our friends will take it. Enter King Arthur, his Court, and Sir Agrovaine. King A. My valiant knightâ Sir A. [to Isonde] My long-lost child, I know It must be nearly eighteen years agoâ King A. Pooh! never mind long stories now. Our care Is for the nuptials of this happy pair. Sir L. My pilgrim's path through life then now is o'er. 'Twas a bold venture; but of that no more. We've all our faultsâgrant mine a kind reception. Enter Sir Tristram. Sir T. If that's the rule, I hope I am no exception! Enter Merlin. Mer. Nay, you've no business here.âAlong with me! Your time has come! Sir T. One moment! Mer. It can't be! Sir T. Inexorable monster, you forget I've got a solo in the chorus yet! Sir L. Burlesque has taken now so wide a field, We would a moral blend with our narration; Let, then, our good intentions prove our shield, And crown our efforts with your approbation. Finale: Air, âRosin the Beau.â Sir L. And now our three perils are over, Let smiles prove our safetyâjust so!â That we may with rapture discover, With you it may come for to go. Chorus. With you it may come for to goâO, O! With you it may come for to go; That each may with rapture discover, With you it may come for to go. Sir T. Young men, shun the snares of temptation, No wine let your wits overthrow; And be sure that you'll have approbation Wherever you come for to go. Chorus. Wherever you come for to go, &amp;c. Curtain.</field>
