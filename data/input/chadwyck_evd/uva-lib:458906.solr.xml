      <field name="fulltext">THE GUARDIAN, A COMICAL-HISTORY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. After twice putting forth to Sea, his Fame Shipwrack'd in either, and his once known Name In two years silence buried, perhaps lost I'the general opinion; at our cost (A zealous sacrifice to Neptune made For good success in his uncertain trade) Our Author weighs up anchors, and once more Forsaking the security of the shore, Resolves to prove his fortune: What 'twill be, Is not in him, or us to prophesie; You only can assure us. Yet he pray'd This little in his absence might be said, Designing me his Orator. He submits To the grave censure of those abler Wits His weakness; nor dares he profess that when The Critiques laugh, he'l laugh at them agen. (Strange felf-love in a writer!) He would know His errors as you find 'em, and bestow His future studies to reform from this What in another might be judg'd amiss. And yet despair not, Gentlemen; though he fear His strengths to please, we hope that you shall hear Some things so writ, as you may truly say He hath not quite forgot to make a Play, As 'tis with malice rumour'd. His intents Are fair; and though he want the complements Of wide-mouth'd Promisers, who still engage (Before their Works are brought upon the Stage) Their parasites to proclaim 'em: This last birth Deliver'd without noise, may yield such mirth, As ballanc'd equally, will cry down the boast Of arrogance, and regain his credit lost.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Durazzo, Camillo, Lentulo, and Donato; two Servants. Dur. Tell me of his expences? Which of you Stands bound for a gazet? he spends his own; And you impertinent Fools, or Knaves, make choice Of either title, which your Signiorships please, To meddle in't. Cam. Your age gives priviledge to this harsh language. Dur. My age! do not use That word agen; if you do, I shall grow young, And swinge you soundly: I would have you know, Though I write fifty odd, I do not carry An Almanack in my bones to predeclare What weather we shall have; nor do I kneel In adoration at the Spring and Fall Before my Doctor, for a dose or two Of his Restoratives, which are things I take it You are familiar with. Cam. This is from the purpose. Dur. I cannot cut a caper, or groan like you When I have done, nor run away so nimbly Out of the field. But bring me to a Fence-school, And crack a blade or two for exercise, Ride a barb'd horse, or take a leap after me Following my hounds or hawks, (and by your leave At a gamesom Mistress) and you shall confess I am in the May of my abilities, And you in your December. Lent. We are glad you bear your years so well. Dur. My years! No more of years; if you do, at your peril. Cam. We desire not To prove your valour. Dur. 'Tis your safest course. Cam. But as friends to your fame and reputation, Come to instruct you: Your too much indulgence To the exorbitant waste of young Caldoroâ Your Nephew and your Ward, hath rendred you But a bad report among wise men in Naples. Dur. Wise men? in your opinion; but to me That understand my self and them, they are Hide-bounded mony-mongers: they would have me Train up my Ward a hopeful youth, to keep A Merchants book, or at the plough, and clothe him In Canvas or course Cotton; while I fell His Woods, grant Leases, which he must make good When he comes to age, or be compell'd to marry With a cast whore and three bastards: Let him know No more then how to cypher well, or do His tricks by the square root; grant him no pleasure But Coyts and Nine-pins; suffer him to converse With none but Clowns and Coblers, as the Turk says: Poverty, old age, and aches of all seasons Light on such heathenish Guardians: Don. You do worse To the ruine of his state, under your favour, In feeding his loose riots. Dur. Riots! what riots? He wears rich clothes, I do so; keeps horses, games, and wenches; 'Tis not amiss, so it be done with decorum: In an Heir 'tis ten times more excusable Then to be over-thrifty. Is there ought else That you can charge him with? Cam. With what we grieve for, And you will not approve. Dur. Out with it, man. Cam. His rash endeavour, without your consent, To match himself into a Family Not gracious with the times. Dur. 'Tis still the better; By this means he shall scape Court-visitants, And not be eaten out of house and home In a Summer-progress. But does he mean to marry? Cam. Yes sir, to marry. Dur. In a beardless chin 'Tis ten times worse then wenching. Family! whose family? Cam. Signior Severnio's. Dur. How? not he that kill'd The brother of his wife (as it is rumour'd) Then fled upon it; since proscrib'd, and chosen Captain of the Banditi; the Kings pardon On no suit to be granted? Lent. The same, sir. Dur. This touches near: How is his love return'd By the Saint he worships? Don. She affects him not, but dotes upon another. Dur. Worse and worse. Cam. You know him, young Adorio. Dur. A brave Gentleman! what proof of this? Lent. I dogg'd him to the Church; Where he, not for devotion, as I ghess, But to make his approaches to his Mistress, Is often seen. Cam: And would you stand conceal'd Among these trees, for he must pass this green, The Mattins ended, as she returns home, You may observe the passages. Dur. I thank you; this torrent must be stopt. Enter Adorio, Caliste, Mirtilla, Caldoro (muffel'd.) Don. They come. Cam. Stand close. Cal. I know I wrong my modesty. Ador. And wrong me, In being so importunate for that I neither can nor must grant. Cal. A hard sentence! and to increase my misery, by you Whom fond affection hath made my Judge, Pronounc'd without compassion. Alas sir, Did I approach you with unchaste desires, A sullid reputation; were deform'd, As it may be I am, though many affirm I am something more then handsom.â Dur. I dare swear it. Calist. Or if I were no Gentlewoman, but bred coursely, You might with some pretence of reason slight What you should sue for. Dur. Were he not an Eunuch, He would, and sue agen; I am sure I should. Pray look in my collar, a flea troubles me: Hey-day! there are a legion of young Cupids At barley-break in my breeches. Calist. Hear me sir; though you continue, nay increase your scorn, Only vouchsafe to let me understand What my defects are; of which once convinc'd, I will hereafter silence my harsh plea, And spare your further trouble. Ador. I'll tell you, and bluntly, as my usual manner is, Though I were a Woman-hater, which I am not, But love the sex, for my ends; take me with you: If in my thought I found one taint or blemish In the whole fabrick of your outward features, I would give my self the lye. You are a Virgin Possess'd of all your mother could wish in you: Your father Severino's dire disaster In killing of your Uncle, which I grieve for, In no part taking from you. I repeat it; A noble Virgin, for whose grace and favours Th'Italian Princes might contend as Rivals; Yet unto me a thing far, far beneath you. A noted Libertine I profess my self: In your mind there does appear one fault so gross, Nay, I might say unpardonable at your years, If justly you consider it, that I cannot As you desire, affect you. Calist. Make me know it, I'le soon reform it. Ador. Would you would keep your word. Cal. Put me to the test. Ador. I will. You are too honest, And like your mother, too strict and religious, And talk too soon of marriage: I shall break, If at that rate I purchase you. Can I part with My uncurb'd liberty, and on my neck Wear such a heavy yoke? hazard my fortunes, With all th'expected joys my life can yield me, For one commodity before I prove it? Venus forbid on both sides; let crook'd hams, Bald heads, declining shoulders, furrow'd cheeks Be aw'd by ceremonies: If you love me I'the way young people should, I'll flie to meet it, And we'll meet merrily. Cal. 'Tis strange such a man can use such language. Ador. In my tongue my heart Speaks freely, fair one! Think upon't, a close friend Or private Mistress, is Court-rhetorick; A Wife, meer rustick Solecism. So good morrow. Cam. How like you this? Adorio offers to go, is staid by Caldoro. Dur. A well-bred Gentleman! I am now thinking if ere in the dark, Or drunk I met his mother? He must have Some drops of my blood in him; for at his years I was much of his religion. Cam. Out upon you! Don. The Colts tooth still in your mouth? Dur. What means this whispering? Ador. You may perceive I seek not to displant you, Where you desire to grow: For further thanks, 'Tis needless complement. Cal. There are some natures Which blush to owe a benefit, if not Receiv'd in corners; holding it an impairing To their own worth, should they acknowledge it. I am made of other clay, and therefore must Trench so far on your leisure, as to win you To lend a patient ear, while I profess Before my glory, though your scorn, Caliste, How much I am your servant. Ador. My designs are not so urgent, but they can dispence With so much time. Cam. Pray you now observe your Nephew. Dur. How he looks! like a School-boy that had plaid the Truant, And went to be breech'd. Cald. Madam! Calist. A new affliction: Your suit offends as much as his repulse, It being not to be granted. Mirt. Hear him Madam, His sorrow is not personated; he deserves Your pitty, not contempt. Dur. He has made the Maid his; And as the Master of the Art of Love Wisely affirms, it is a kind of passage To the Mistress favour. Cald. I come not to urge My merit to deserve you, since you are, Weigh'd truly to your worth, above all value: Much less to argue you of want of judgment For following one that with wing'd feet flies from you; While I, at all parts (without boast) his equal, In vain pursue you; bringing those flames with me, Those lawful flames, (for Madam know, with other I never shall approach you) which Adorio In scorn of Hymen and religious rites With atheistical impudence contemns, And in his loose attempt to undermine The fortress of your honor, seeks to ruine All holy Altars by clear mindes erected To Virgin-honor. Dur. My Nephew is an ass, What a devil hath he to do with Virgin-honor, Altars, or lawful flames? when he should tell her They are superstitious nothings, and speak to the purpose, Of the delight to meet in the old dance Between a pair of sheets; my Grandame call'd it The peopling of the world. Calist. How, gentle sir? to vindicate my honor, that is needless; I dare not fear the worst aspersion malice Can throw upon it. Cald. Your sweet patience, Lady, and more then Dove-like innocence renders you Insensible of an injury, for which I deeply suffer. Can you undergo The scorn of being refus'd? I must confess It makes for my ends; for had he embrac'd Your gracious offers tender'd him, I had been In my own hopes forsaken; and if yet There can breathe any air of comfort in me, To his contempt I owe it: but his ill No more shall make way for my good intents, Then vertue powerful in her self, can need The aids of vice. Ador. You take that licence, sir, which yet I never granted. Cald. I'll force more, nor will I for mine own ends undertake it, As I will make apparent) but to do A justice to your sex, with mine own wrong And irrecoverable loss. To thee I turn, Thou goatish Ribaud, in whom lust is grown Defensible, the last descent to hell, Which gapes wide for thee: Look upon this Lady, And on her fame, (if it were possible Fairer then she is) and if base desires And beastly appetite will give thee leave, Consider how she sought thee, how this Lady In a noble way desir'd thee: Was she fashion'd In an inimitable mould, (which nature broke, The great work perfected) to be made a slave To thy libidinous twines, and when commanded To be us'd as physick after drunken surfets? Mankind should rise against thee: What even now I heard with horror, shew'd like blasphemy, And as such I will punish it. He strikes Adorio, the rest make in, they all draw. Calist. Murder! Mir. Help! Dur. After a whining Prologue, who would have look'd for Such a rough Catastophre? Nay, come on, fear nothing: Never till now my Nephew. And do you hear sir, (And yet I love thee too) if you take the wench now I'll have it posted first, then chronicled, Thou wert beaten to't. Ador. You think you have shewn A memorable masterpiece of valor In doing this in publick; and it may Perhaps deserve her shoo-string for a favor: Wear it without my envy; but expect For this affront, when time serves, I shall call you To a strict accompt. Exeunt. Dur. Hook on, follow him Harpies, You may feed upon this business for a moneth, If you manage it handsomly: when two heirs quarrel, The sword-men of the City shortly after Appear in Plush, for their grave consultations In taking up the difference; Some I know make a set living on't. Nay, let him go, Thou art master of the field; enjoy thy fortune With moderation: For a flying foe, Discreet and provident Conquerors build up A bridge of gold. To thy mistress, boy! if I were I'thy shirt, how I could nick it! Cald. You stand, Madam, as you were rooted, and I more then fear My passion hath offended: I perceive The roses frighted from your cheeks, and paleness T'usurp their room; yet you may please to ascribe it To my excess of love, and boundless ardor To do you right; for my self I have done nothing: I will not curse my stars, howere assur'd To me you are lost for ever: For suppose Adorio slain, and by my hand, my life Is forfeited to the law; which I contemn, So with a tear or two you would remember I was your martyr, and died in your service. Calist. Alas, you weep! and in my just compassion Of what you suffer, I were more then marble, Should I not keep you company: You have sought My favours nobly, and I am justly punish'd In wild Adorio's contempt and scorn For my ingratitude, it is no better, To your deservings: Yet such is my fate, Though I would, I cannot help it. O Caldoro! In our misplac'd affection I prove Too soon, and with dear bought experience, Cupid Is blind indeed, and hath mistook his arrows. If it be possible, learn to forget: And yet that punishment is too light; to hate A thankless Virgin, practise it; and may Your due consideration that I am so, In your imagination disperse Lothsom deformity upon this face That hath bewitch'd you. More I cannot say, But that I truly pitty you, and wish you A better choice, which in my prayers (Caldoro) I ever will remember. Ex. Caliste, Mirtilla. Dur. 'Tis a sweet rogue: why how now? thunderstruck? Cald. I am not so happy: Oh that I were but master of my self, You soon should see me nothing. Dur. What would you do? Cald. With one stab give a fatal period To my woes and life together. Dur. For a Woman! better the kind were lost, and generation maintain'd a new way. Cald. Pray you sir forbear this profane language. Dur. Pray you be you a man, And whimper not like a girl: All shall be well, As I live it shall; this is no Hectique feaver, But a Love-sick ague easie to be cur'd, And I'll be your Physitian, so you subscribe To my directions. First you must change This City whorish air, for 'tis infected, And my potions will not work here, I must have you To my Country-villa: Rise before the sun, Then make a breakfast of the morning-dew Serv'd up by nature on some grassie hill; You'll find it Nectar, and far more cordial Then Cullises, Cock-broth, or your distillations Of a hundred crowns a quart. Cald. You talk of nothing. Dur. This tane as a preparative to strengthen Your queasie stomack, vault into your saddle; With all this flesh I can do it without a stirrup: My hounds uncoupled, and my huntsmen ready, You shal hear such musick from their tunable mouths That you will say the Viol, Harp, Theorbo, Nere made such ravishing harmony, from the groves And neighboring Woods, with frequent iterations, Enamor'd of the cry, a thousand eccho's Repeating it. Cald. What's this to me? Dur. It shall be, and you give thanks for't. In the afternoon (For we will have variety of delights) We'll to the field agen, no game shall rise But we'll be ready for't; if a Hare, my Greyhounds Shall make a course; for the Pye or Jay, a Sparhawk Flies from the Fist; the Crow so near pursu'd, Shall be compell'd to seek protection under Our Horses bellies; a Hearn put from her siege, And a Pistol shot off in her breech, shall mount So high, that to your view she'll seem to soar Above the middle Region of the Air. A cast of Haggard Falcons, by me man'd, Eying the prey at first, appear as if They did turn tayl, but with their laboring wings Getting above her, with a thought their pinions Cleaving the purer Element, make in, And by turns binde with her; the frighted Fowl, Lying at her defence upon her back, With her dreadful Beak, a while defers her death, But by degrees forc'd down, we part the fray And feast upon her. Cald. This cannot be, I grant, but pretty pastime, Dur. Pretty pastime, Nephew! 'Tis royal sport, then for an Evening flight A Tercel gentle, which I call my Masters, As he were sent a Messenger to the Moon, In such a place flies, as he seems to say, See me, or see me not, the Partridge sprung, He makes his stoop; but wanting breath, is forc'd To cancellior, then with such speed, as if He carried Lightning in his Wings, he strikes The trembling Bird; who even in death appears Proud to be made his quarry. Cald. Yet all this, is nothing to Caliste. Dur. Thou shalt finde twenty Calistes there, for every night A fresh, and lusty one; I'll give thee a Ticket, In which my name, Durazzo's name subscrib'd, My Tenants Nutbrown daughters, wholsom Girls, At midnight shall contend to do thee service. I have bred them up to't; should their Fathers murmure, Their Leases are void; for that is a main point In my Indentures: And when we make our progress There is no entertainment perfect, if This last dish be not offer'd. Cald. You make me smile. Dur. I'll make thee laugh outright. My horses, knaves! 'Tis but six short hours riding: yet ere night Thou shalt be an alter'd man. Cald. I wish I may, sir. Exeunt: Enter Jolante, Caliste, Calypso, Mirtilla. Jol. I had spies upon you Minion; the relation Of your behaviour was at home before you: My daughter to hold parley, from the Church too, With noted Libertines? her fame and favours The quarrel of their swords? Calist. 'Twas not in me to help it, Madam. Jol. No? how have I liv'd? My neighbour knows my manners have been such, That I presume I may affirm, and boldly, In no particular action of my life I can be justly censur'd. Calyp. Censur'd, Madam? what Lord or Lady lives, worthy to sit A competent Judge on you? Calist. Yet black detraction will find faults where they are not. Calyp. Her foul mouth Is stopp'd, you being the object: Give me leave To speak my thoughts, yet still under correction: And if my young Lady and her woman here, With reverence they may be edifi'd. You are my gracious Patroness and supportress, And I your poor observer, nay your creature Fed by your bounties; and but that I know Your Honor detests flattery, I might say (And with an emphasis) You are the Lady Admir'd and envied at, far, far above All imitation of the best of women That are or ever shall be. This is truth: I dare not be obsequious; and 'twould ill Become my gravity, and wisdom glean'd From your oraculous Ladiship, to act The part of a she-parasite. Jol. If you do, I never shall acknowledge you. Calist. Admirable! this is no flattery. Mirt. 'Do not interrupt her: 'Tis such a pleasing itch to your Lady-mother, That she may peradventure forget us, To feed on her own praises. Jol. I am not so far in debt to age, but if I would Listen to mens bewitching sorceries, I could be courted. Calyp. Rest secure of that; all the Braveries of the City run mad for you, And yet your vertue's such, not one attempts you. Jol. I keep no mankind servant in my house, In fear my chastity may be suspected: How is that voic'd in Naples? Calyp. With loud applause, I assure your Honor. Jol. It confirms I can command my sensual appetites. Calyp. As vassals to your more then masculine reason that commands 'em: Your palace stil'd a Nunnery of pureness, In which not one lascivious thought dares enter, Your clear soul standing Sentinel. Mirt. Well said, Eccho. Jol. Yet I have tasted those delights which women So greedily long for, know their titillations; And when with danger of his head thy father Comes to give comfort to my widowed sheets, As soon as his desires are satisfied, I can with ease forget 'em. Calyp. Observe that, It being indeed remarkable: 'tis nothing For a simple Maid that never had her hand In the hony-pot of pleasure, to forbear it; But such as have lick'd there, and lick'd there often, And felt the sweetness of't.â Mirt. How her mouth runs over with rank imagination! Calyp. If such can, As I urg'd before, the kickshaw being offer'd Refuse to take it, like my matchless Madam, They may be Sainted. Jol. I'll lose no more breath In fruitless reprehension; look to't, I'll have thee wear this habit of my mind, As of my body. Calyp. Seek no other president: In all the books of Amadis de Gaul, The Palmerins, and that true Spanish story The Mirror of Knighthood, which I have read often, Read feelingly, nay more, I do believe in't My Lady has no parallel. Jol. Do not provoke me. If from this minute, thou ere stir abroad, Write Letter or receive one, or presume To look upon a man, though from a Window, I'll chain thee like a slave in some dark corner; Proscribe thy daily labor: Which omitted, Expect the usage of a Fury from me, Not an indulgent Mothers, Come Calypso. Calyp. Your Ladiships injunctions are so easie, That I dare pawn my credit, my yong Lady And her woman shall obey 'em. Exeunt Jol. Calyp. Mirtil. You shall fry first For a rotten peece of dry Touchwood, and give fire To the great Fiends Nostrils, when he smokes Tobacco. Note the injustice Madam; they would have us Being yong and hungry, keep a perpetual Lent, And the whole yeer to them a Carnivale. Easie injunctions, with a mischief to you: Suffer this, and suffer all. Caliste. Not stir abroad! The use and pleasure of our eyes deny'd us? Mirt. Insufferable. Cal. Nor write, nor yet receive an amorous Letter! Mirt. Not to be endured. Cal. Nor look upon a man out of a Windore. Mirt. Flat tyranny, insupportable tyranny To a Lady of your Blood. Cal. She is my Mother, &amp; how I should decline it? Mirt. Run away from't, take any course. Cal. But without means Mirtilla, how shall we live? Mirt. What a question's that; as if A bucksom Lady could want maintenance In any place in the World, where there are Men, Wine, Meat, or Money stirring. Cal. Be you more modest, Or seek some other Mistress: Rather then In a thought or dream, I will consent to ought That may take from my honor, I'll endure More then my Mother can impose upon me. Mirt. I grant your honor is a specious dressing, But without conversation of men, A kinde of nothing; I will not perswade you To disobedience: Yet my Confessor told me (And he you know is held a learned Clerk) When Parents do enjoyn unnatural things, Wise Children may evade 'em. She may as well Command when you are hungry, not to eat, Or drink, or sleep; and yet all these are easie Compar'd with the not seeing of a man, As I perswade no farther, but to you There is no such necessity; you have means To shun your Mothers rigor. Cal. Lawful means? Mirt. Lawful, and pleasing too, I will not urge Caldoro's loyal love, you being averse to't, Make tryal of Adorio. Cal. And give up my honor to his lust. Mirt. There's no such thing Intended, Madam; in few words write to him What slavish hours you spend under your Mother, That you desire not present marriage from him, But as a noble Gentleman to redeem you From the tyranny you suffer. With your Letter Present him some rich Jewel; you have one, In which the Rape of Proserpine, in little Is to the life express'd. I'll be the Messenger With any hazard, and at my return, Yeeld you a good accompt of't. Calist. 'Tis a business to be consider'd of. Mirt. Consideration, when the converse of your Lover is in question, Is of no moment: If she would allow you A Dancer in the morning to well breathe you, A Songster in the afternoon, a Servant To air you in the evening; give you leave To see the Theater twice a week, to mark How the old Actors decay, the young sprout up, A fitting observation, you might bear it; But not to see, or talk, or touch a man, Abominable! Calist: Do not my blushes speak How willingly I would assent? Mirt: Sweet Lady, Do somthing to deserve 'em, and blush after. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Jolante, Calypso. Jol. And are these French-men, as you say, such Gallants? Calyp. Gallant and active; their free breeding knows not The Spanish and Italian preciseness Practis'd among us. What we call immodest, With them is stil'd bold Courtship: they dare fight Under a Velvet-Ensign at fourteen. Jol. A Petticoat you mean. Calyp. You are i'the right; Let a Mistress wear it under an armor of proof, They are not to be beaten off. Jol. You are merry Neighbor. Calyp. I fool to make you so, pray you observe 'em. They are the forwardest Monsieurs; born Physitians For the malady of yong Wenches, and ne'er miss, I ow my life to one of 'em, when I was A raw yong thing, not worth the ground I trod on; And long'd to dip my Bread in Tar, my Lips As blue as Salt-water, he came up roundly to me, And cur'd me in an instant, Venus be prais'd for't. Enter Alphonso, General, Monteclaro, Attendants, and Captain. Jol. They come, leave prating. Col. I am dumb, an't like your honor. Alph. We will not break the league confirm'd between us, And your great Master; the passage of his Army Through all our Territories, lies open to him; Onely we grieve that your design for Rome Commands such haste, as it denies us means To entertain you, as your worth deserves, And we would gladly tender. Gen. Royal Alphonso, the King my Master, your confederate, Will pay the debt he ows, in Fact, which I Want words t'express; I must remove to night, And yet, that your intended favors may not Be lost, I leave this Gentleman behinde me, To whom you may vouchsafe 'em; I dare say Without Repentance, I forbear to give Your Majesty his character; in France He was a President for Arts and Arms Alphonso receives Monteclaro Without a rival, &amp; may prove in Naples Worthy thy imitation. Calyp. Is he not Madam A Monsieur in print? What a garb was there? O rare! Then how he wears his clothes, and the fashion of 'em. A main assurance that he is within All excellent: By this, wise Ladies ever Make their conjectures. Jol. Peace, I have observ'd him From head to foot. Calyp. Eye him agen, all over. Monte. It cannot royal Sir, but argue me Of much presumption, if not impudence, To be a suitor to your Majesty, Before I have deserv'd a gratious grant, By some employment prosperously atchiev'd. But pardon gracious Sir: when I left France I made a vow to a bosom Friend of mine (Which my Lord General, if he please, can witness) With such humility, as well becomes A poor Petitioner to desire a Boon He delivers a Petition. From your magnificence. Calyp. With what punctual form he does deliver it. Jol. I have eyes; no more. Alph. For Severino's pardon, you must excuse me, I dare not pardon murther. Monte. His fact Sir, ever submitting to your abler judgment, Merits a fairer name: He was provok'd, As by unanswerable proofs it is confirm'd, By Monteclaro's rashness; who repining That Severino, without his consent, Had married Jolante his sole sister (It being concleal'd almost for thirteen years) Though the Gentleman, at all parts, was his equal, First challeng'd him, and that declin'd, he gave him A blow in publick. Gen. Not to be endur'd, but by a slave. Monte. This, great Sir, justly weigh'd, You may a little, if you please, take from The rigor of your Justice, and express An act of mercy. Jol. I can hear no more, This opens an old wound, and makes a new one. Would it were cicatriz'd, waite me. Calyp. As your shadow. Exeunt Jol. Calyp. Alph. We grant you these are glorious pretences, Revenge appearing in the shape of valor, Which wise Kings must distinguish. The defence Of Reputation, now made a Bawd To murther; every trifle falsly stil'd An injury, and not to be determin'd But by a bloody Duel; though this vice Hath taken root and growth beyond the Mountains (As France, and in strange fashions her Ape England can deerly witness, with the loss Of more brave spirits, then would have stood the shock Of the Turks army) while Alphonso lives It shall not here be planted: Move me no further In this. In what else suiting you to ask, And me to give, expect a gratious answer, How ever welcome to our Court, Lord General, I'll bring you out of the Ports, and then betake you To your good fortune. Gen. Your Grace overwhelms me. Exeunt. Enter Calypso, and Jolante (with a Purse and a Jewel) Calyp. You are bound to favor him: Mark you how he pleaded For my Lords pardon. Jol. That's indeed a tye; but I have a stronger on me. Calyp. Say you love His person, be not asham'd of't, he's a man; For whose embraces though Endimion Lay sleeping by, Cinthia would leave her orb, And exchange kisses with him. Jol. Do not Fan A fire that burns already to hot in me, I am in my honor sick, sick to the death, Never to be recovered. Calyp. What a coyl's here For loving a man? It is no Africk wonder, If like Pasiphae you doted on a Bull, Indeed 'twere monstrous: but in this you have A thousand thousand presidents to excuse you. A Sea-mans wife may ask relief of her Neighbor When her husbands bound to the Indies, and not blam'd for't; And many more besides of higher calling, Though I forbear to name 'em: You have a husband, But as the case stands with my Lord, he is A kinde of no husband; and your Ladiship As free as a widow can be. I confess If Ladies should seek change, that have their husbands At Boord and Bed, to pay their marriage duties, The surest bond of concord, 'twere a fault, Indeed it were: But for your honor that Do lie alone so often, Body of me, I am zealous in your cause; let me take breath. Jol. I apprehend what thou wouldst say: I want all As means to quench the spurious fire that burns here. Calyp. Want means while I your Creature live? I dare not Be so unthankful. Jol. Wilt thou undertake it, And as an earnest of much more to come Receive this Jewel, and Purse cramn'd full of Crowns, How dearly I am forc'd to buy dishonor. Calyp. I would do it gratis, but 'twould ill become My breeding to refuse your honors bounty, Nay, say no more, all Rhetorick in this Is comprehended; let me alone to work him, He shall be yours; that's poor, he is already At your devotion I will not boast My faculties this way, but suppose he were Coy as Adonis, or Hippolitus, And your desires more hot then Citherea's, Or wanton Phedras, I will bring him chain'd To your embraces, glorying in his Fetters. I have said it. Jol. Go and prosper, and imagine a salary beyond thy hopes. Calyp. Sleep you Secure on either ear, the burthens yours To entertain him, mine to bring him hither. Exeunt. Enter Adorio, Camillo, Lentulo, Donato. Don. Your wrong's beyond a challenge, and you deal To fairly with him, if you take that way To right your self. Lent. The least that you can do I'th' terms of honor is, when next you meet him To give him the bastinado. Cam. And that done, Draw out his Sword to cut your own throat. No, Be rul'd by me, shew your self an Italian, And having received one injury, do not put off Your Hat for a second; there are fellows that For a few crowns will make him sure, and so With your revenge, you prevent future misthief. Ador. I thank you Gentlemen for your studied care In what concerns my honor; but in that I'll steer mine own course, yet that you may know You are still my Cabinet Counsellers, my bosom Lies open to you. I begin to feel A weariness, nay, satiety of looseness, And something tells me here, I should repent My harshness to Caliste. Enter Cario (in haste.) Cam. When you please, you may remove that scruple. Ador. I shall think on't. Car. Sir, Sir, are you ready? Ador. To do what? I am sure 'tis not yet dinner time. Car. True; but I usher Such an unexpected dainty bit for breakfast, As yet I never cook'd? 'tis not Potargo, Fride Frogs, Potato's Marrow'd, Cavear, Carps Tongues, the Pith of an English Chine of Beef, Nor our Italian delicate Oyl'd Mushrooms, And yet a drawer on too; and if you shew not An appetite, and a strong one; I'll not say To eat it, but devour it, without grace too, For it will not stay a Preface. I am sham'd, And all my past provocatives will be jeer'd at. Ador. Art thou in thy wits? what new found rarity Hast thou discover'd? Car. No such matter Sir; it grows in our own Country. Don. Serve it up, I feel a kinde of stomach. Cam. I could feed too. Car. Not a bit upon a march; there's other Lettice For your course Lips; this is peculiar onely For my Masters palate, I would give my whole years wages With all my vails, and fees due to the Kitchin, But to be his Carver. Ador. Leave your fooling Sirrah, and bring in your dainty. Car. 'Twill bring in it self, It has life and spirit in it, and for proof, Behold: Now fall to boldly, my life on't It comes to be tasted. Enter Mirtilla (with Letter and Jewel.) Cam. Ha! Calistes Woman. Lent. A handsom one by Venus. Ador. Pray you forbear, You are welcome fair one. Don. How that blush becomes her. Ador. Aim your designs at me? Mirt. I 'em trusted Sir With a business of near consequence, which I would To your private ear deliver: Car. I told you so. Give her audience on your Couch, it is fit state To a she Ambassador. Ador. Pray you Gentlemen For a while dispose of your selves, I'll strait attend you. Exit. Car. Dispatch her first for your honor, the quickly doing, You know what follows. Ador. Will you please to vanishâ Exit Cario. Now pretty one, your pleasure; you shall finde me Ready to serve you, if you'll put me to My Oath, I'll take it on this Book. Mirt. O Sir, the favor is too great, and far above My poor ambition, I must kiss your hand In sign of humble thankfulness. Ador. So modest. Mirt. It well becomes a Maid, Sir, spare those blessings For my noble Mistress, upon whom with Justice, And with your good allowance, I might adde With a due gratitude; you may confer 'em, But this will better speak her chast desires Delivers the Letter. Then I can fancy what they are, much less With moving language to their fair deserts Aptly express 'em. Pray you read, but with Compassion, I beseech you: if you finde The Paper blur'd with tears faln from her eyes, While she endeavor'd to set down that truth Her Soul did dictate to her, it must challenge A gratious answer. Ador. O the powerful charms! By that fair hand writ down here; not like those Which dreadfully pronounc'd by Circe, chang'd Ulysses followers into Beasts; these have An opposite working, I already feel But reading 'em, their saving operations, And all those sensual, loose, and base desires Which have too long usurped, and tyranniz'd Over my Reason, of themselves fall of Most happy Metamorphosis! in which The film of Error that did blinde my Judgment And seduc'd Understanding, is remov'd. What Sacrifice of Thanks can I return Her pious Charity, that not alone Redeems me from the worst of slavery, The tyranny of my beastly appetites; To which, I long obsequiously have bow'd, But addes a matchless favor to receive A benefit from me, nay, puts her Goodness In my protection. Mirt. Transform'd? it is Aside. A blessed Metamorphosis, and works I know not how on me. Ador. My joys are boundless, Curb'd with no limits; for her sake, Mirtilla, Instruct me how I presently may seal To those strong bonds of loyal love, and service Which never shall be cancell'd. Mirt. She'll become your debter Sir, if you vouchsafe to answer Her pure affection. Ador. Answer it Mirtilla; with more then adoration I kneel to it. Tell her I'll rather die a thousand deaths, Then fail with punctuality to perform All her commands. Mirt. I am lost on this assurance, (Which if 'twere made to me, I should have faith in't, Aside. As in an Oracle. Ah me) she presents you This Jewel, her dead Grandsirs gift, in which, As by a true Egyptian Herogliphick, (For so I think she call'd it) you may be Instructed what her suit is, you should do, And she with joy will suffer. Ador. Heaven be pleas'd to qualifie this excess of happiness With some disaster, or I shall expire With a surfeit of Felicity, with what art The cunning Lapidary hath here express'd The rape of Proserpine, I apprehend Her purpose, and obey it, yet not as A helping Friend, but a Husband, I will meet Her chast desires with lawful heat, and warm Our HymenÃ¦al sheets with such delights As leave no sting behinde 'em. Mirt. I despair then. Aside. Ador. At the time appointed, say wench, I'll attend her, And guard her from the fury of her Mother, And all that dare disturb her. Mirt. You speak well, and I believe you. Ador. Would you ought else. Mirt. I would carry some love sign to her; and now I think on't, The kinde salute you offer'd at my entrance, Hold it not impudence that I desire it, I'll faithfully deliver it. Ador. O a kiss, you must excuse me, I was then mine own, Now wholly hers. The touch of other Lips I do abjure for ever; but there's Gold To binde thee still my advocate. Exit. Mirt. Not a kiss? I was coy when it was offered, and now justly When I beg one am deni'd, what scortching fires My loose hopes kindle in me? Shall I be False to my Ladies trust? and from a servant Rise up her rival? His words have bewitch'd me, And something I must do, but what? 'tis yet An embrion, and how to give it form Alas I know not, pardon me, Caliste, I am nearest to my self, and time will teach me To perfect that which yet is undetermined. Exit. Enter Claudio and Severino. Claud. You are Master of your self, yet if I may As a tri'd Friend in my love and affection, And a servant in my duty speak my thoughts, Without offence? i'th' way of counsel to you, I could alleage, and truly that your purpose For Naples cover'd with a thin disguise Is full of danger. Sever. Danger Claudio? 'Tis here, and every where our forc'd companion, The rising and the setting Sun, beholds us Inviron'd with it; our whole life a journey Ending in certain ruine. Claud. Yet we should not, howev'r besieg'd, deliver up our Fort Of life, till it be forc'd. Sever. 'Tis so indeed by wisest men concluded, which we should Obey as Christians; but when I consider How different the progress of our actions Are from Religion, nay, Morality, I cannot finde in Reason, why we should Be scrupulous that way onely, or like Meteors Blaze forth prodigious terrors, till our stuff Be utterly consum'd, which once put out, Would bring security unto our selves, And safety unto those we prey upon. O Claudio! since by this fatal hand The brother of my wife, bold Monteclaro, Was left dead in the field, and I proscrib'd After my flight, by the justice of the King, My being hath been but a living death With a continued torture. Claud. Yet in that you do delude their bloody violence That do pursue your life. Sever. While I by rapines live terrible to others as my self, What one hour can we challenge as our own (Unhappy as we are) yielding a beam Of comfort to us? Quiet night that brings Rest to the labourer, is the Outlaws day, In which he rises early to do wrong, And when his work is ended, dares not sleep: Our time is spent in watches to intrap Such as would shun us, and to hide our selves From the Ministers of Justice, that would brihg us To the correction of the Law. O Claudio, Is this a life to be preserv'd? and at So dear a rate? But why hold I discourse On this sad subject? since it is a burthen We are mark'd to bear, and not to be shook off But with our humane frailty. In the change Of dangers there is some delight, and therefore I am resolv'd for Naples. Claud. May you meet there All comforts that so fair and chaste a wife (As fame proclaims her without parallel) Can yield to ease your sorrows. Sever. I much thank you; Yet you may spare those wishes, which with joy I have prov'd certainties, and from their want Her excellencies take lustre. Claud. Ere you go yet, Some charge unto your Squires not to flie out Beyond their bounds, were not impertinent: For though that with a look you can command 'em, In your absence they'll be headstrong Sever. 'Tis well thought on, I'll touch my horn, they know my call, Blows his horn. Claud. And will, as soon as heard, make in to't from all quarters, As the flock to the shepherds whistle. Enter six Banditi. 1: What's your will? 2. Hail Soveraign of these Woods. 3. We lay our lives at your Highness feet. 4. And will confess no King, Nor Laws, but what come from your mouth; and those We gladly will subscribe to: Sever. Make this good In my absence to my substitute, to whom Pay all obedience as to my self: The breach of this in one particular I will severely punish; on your lives Remember upon whom with our allowance You may securely prey, with such as are Exempted from your fury. Claud. 'Twere not amiss, If you please, to help their memory; besides, Here are some newly initiated. Sever. To these read you the Articles: I must be gone; Claudio, farewell. Claud. May your return be speedy. Ex. Sever. 1. Silence; out with your Table-books. 2. And observe. Claud. The Cormorant that lives in expectation Of a long wish'd for dearth, and smiling grindes The faces of the poor, you may make spoil of; Even theft to such is Justice. 3. He's in my Tables. Claud. The grand Incloser of the Commons, for His private profit, or delight, withal His Herds that graze upon't are lawful prize, 4. And we will bring 'em in, although the devil Stood roaring by, to guard 'em. Claud. If a Usurer, Greedy at his own price, to make a purchase, Taking advantage upon Bond, or Morgage, From a Prodigal, pass through our Territories, I'the way of custom, or of tribute to us, You may ease him of his burthen. 2. Wholsome doctrine. Claud. Builders of iron Mills, that grub up Forests, With Timber Trees for shipping. 1. May we not have a touch at Lawyers. Claud. By no means; they may To soon have a gripe at us; they are angry Hornets, Not to be jested with. 3. This is not so well. Claud. The owners of dark shops that vent their wares With Perjuries; cheating Vintners not contented With half in half in their reckonings, yet cry out When they finde their ghests want coyn, 'tis late, and Bed-time; These ransack at your pleasures. 3. How shall we know 'em. Claud. If they walk on foot by their Rat-colour'd stockings, And shining shooes. If Horsmen by short Boots, And riding furniture of several Counties. 2. Not one of the List escapes us. Claud. But for Schollars, Whose wealth lies in their heads, &amp; not their pockets, Soldiers that have bled in their Countries service, The Rent-rack'd Farmer, needy Market folks, The sweaty Laborer; Carriers that transport The goods of other men, are priviledg'd; But above all, let none presume to offer Violence to women, for our King hath sworn, Who that way's a Delinquent; without mercy Hangs for't by Marshal law. Omnes. Long live Severino. And perish all such cullions as repine at his new Monarchy. Claud. About your business, That he may finde at his return good cause To praise your care and discipline. Omnes. We'll not fail Sir. Exeunt. Enter Monteclaro and Calypso. Mont. Thou art sure mistaken, 'tis not possible That I can be the man thou art employ'd too. Calyp. Not you the man? you are the man of men, And such another in my Ladies eye, Never to be discover'd. Mont. A meer stranger newly arriv'd? Calyp. Still the more probable, Since Ladies, as you know, affect strange dainties, And brought far to 'em. This is not an age In which Saints live; but women, knowing women, That understand their summum bonum, is Variety of pleasures in the touch, Deriv'd from several Nations; and if men Would be wise by their example. Mont. As most are. 'Tis a coupling age! Calyp. Why sir, do Gallants travel? Answer that question; but at their return With wonder to the hearers, to discourse of The garb and difference in foreign Females. As the lusty Girle of France, the sober German, The plump Dutch Fro, the stately Dame of Spain, The Roman Libertine, and spriteful Tuscan, The merry Greek, Venetian Courtesan, The English fair Companion, that learns something From every Nation, and will flie at all. I say again the difference betwixt these And their own Country Gamesters. Mont. Aptly urg'd. Some make that their main end; but may I ask Without offence to your gravity, By what title Your Lady that invites me to her favors, Is known in the City. Calyp. If you were a true born Monsieur, You would do the business first, and ask that after. If you onely truck with her title, I shall hardly Deserve thanks for my travel; she is Sir No single Duccat trader, nor a Beldam So frozen up, that a Fever cannot thaw her. No Lioness by her breath. Mont. Leave these impertinencies, and come to the matter. Calyp. Would you woo'd be as forward When you draw for the upshot, she is Sir a Lady, A rich, fair, well-complexioned, and what is Not frequent among Venus Votaries, Upon my credit, which good men have trusted; A sound and wholedom Lady, and her name is Madona Jolante. Mont. Jolante. I have heard of her, for chastity, and beauty; The wonder of the age. Calyp. Pray you not too much, Of chastity, fair, and free I do subscribe too, And so you'll finde her. Mont. Come y'are a base Creature, And covering your foul ends with her fair name, Give me just reason, to suspect you have A plot upon my life. Calyp. A plot! Very fine! Nay, 'tis a dangerous one, pray you beware of't, 'Tis cunningly contriv'd, I plot to bring you A foot with the travel of some forty paces, To those delights, which a man not made of Snow, Would ride a thousand miles for. You shall be Receiv'd at a Postern door, if you be not cautious, By one whose touch would make old Nestor yong, And cure his Hernia? A terrible plot! A kiss then ravished from you by such Lips As flow with Nectar, a Juicy-palm more pretious Then the fam'd Sibilla's Bough to guide you safe Through Mists of perfumes to a glorious room, Where Jove might feast his Juno, a dire plot, A Banquet I'll not mention, that is common; But I must not forget to make the plot More horrid to you. The retiring bower So furnish'd, as might force the Persians envy, The Silver bathing Tub, the Cambrick rubbers, Th'embroider'd Quilt, a Bed of Gossamire, And Damask Roses, a meer Powder plot To blow you up; and last, a Bed-fellow, To whose rare entertainment all these are But foils, and settings off. Mont. No more, her breath would warm an Euenuch. Calyp. I knew I should heat you; now he begins to glow. Mont. I am flesh and blood, And I were not man, if I should not run the hazard, Had I no other ends in't, I have consider'd Your motion, Matron. Calyp. My Plot Sir on your life, For which, I am deservedly suspected For a base and dangerous woman. Fare you well Sir, I'll be bold to take my leave. Mont. I will along too. Come pardon my suspition, I confess My Error; and eying you better, I perceive There's nothing that is ill that can flow from you. I am serious, and for proof of it I'll purchase Your good opinion. Calyp. I am gently natur'd, And can forget a greater wrong upon Such terms of satisfaction. Mont. What's the hour. Calyp. Twelve. Mont. I'll not miss a minute. Calyp. I shall finde you at your lodging? Mont. Certainly, return my service, And for me kiss your Ladies hands. Calyp. At twelve, I'll be your convoy. Mont. I desire no better. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Durazzo, Caldoro, Servant. Dur. Walk the Horses down the Hill, I have a little To speak in private. Cald. Good Sir, no more anger. Duraz. Love do you call it? Madness, wilful Madness; And since I cannot cure it, I would have you Exactly mad. You are a lover already, Be a drunkard too, and after turn small Poet, And then you are mad Katexikene, the Madman. Cald. Such as are safe on shore, may smile at tempests, But I that am embarqu'd, and every minute Expect a shipwrack, rellish not your mirthe; To me it is unseasonable. Duraz. Pleasing Viands, are made sharp by sick palats. I affect A handsom Mistress in my grey Beard, as well As any Boy of you all; and on good terms Will venture as far i'th' fire, so she be willing To entertain me; but ere I would dote As you do, where there is no flattering hope Ever t'enjoy her, I would forswear Wine, And kill this letcherous Itch with drinking Water, Or live like a Carthusian on Poor-John, Then bathe my self, night by night, in marble dew, And use no Soap but Camphir-Balls. Cald. You may (and I must suffer it) like a rough Surgeon, Apply these burning costicks to my wounds Already gangreen'd, when soft unguents would Better express an Uncle, with some feeling Of his Nephews torments. Duraz. I shall melt, and cannot Hold out if he whimper. O that this yong fellow, Who on my knowledge is able to beat a man, Should be baffel'd by this blinde imagin'd-Boy, Or fear his Bird-bolts. Cald. Y'have put your self already To too much trouble in bringing me thus far: Now if you please, with your good wishes leave me To my hard fortunes. Dur. I'll forsake my self first. Leave thee? I cannot, will not; thou shalt have No cause to be weary of my company, For I'll be useful, and ere I see thee perish, Dispensing with my dignity and candor, I will do something for thee, though it savour Of the old Squire of Troy. As we ride, we will Consult of the means: Bear up. Cal. I cannot sink, Having your noble aids to buoy me up; There was never such such a Guardian. Dur. How's this? stale complements to me? when my work's done, Commend th'artificer, and then be thankful. Exeunt. Enter Caliste (richly habited) and Mirtilla (in her first gown.) Cal. How doest thou like my gown? Mirt. 'Tis rich and Courtlike. Cal. The dressings too are suitable? Mir. I must say so, or you might blame my want of care. Cal. My mother Little dreams of my intended flight, or that These are my nuptial ornaments. Mir. I hope so. Cal. How dully thou repliest! thou dost not envy Adorio's noble change, or the good fortune That it brings to me? Mir. My endeavours that way can answer for me. Cal. True, you have discharged A faithful Servants duty, and it is By me rewarded like a liberal Mistress: I speak it not to upbraid you with my bounties, Though they deserve more thanks and ceremony Then you have yet express'd. Mir. The miseries which from your happiness I am sure to suffer, Restrain my forward tongue; and gentle Madam, Excuse my weakness, though I do appear A little daunted with the heavy burthen I am to undergo: when you are safe, My dangers like to roaring torrents will Gush in upon me; yet I would endure Your mothers cruelty; but how to bear Your absence, in the very thought confounds me: Since we were children, I have lov'd and serv'd you; I willingly learn'd to obey, as you Grew up to knowledg, that yo' might command me; And now to be divorc'd from all my comforts, Can this be borne with patience? Cal. The necessity of my strange fate commands it; but I vow By my Adorio's love, I pitty thee. Cal. Pitty me, Madam! a cold charity; You must do more, and help me. Cal. Ha! what said you? I must? is this fit language for a servant? Mir. For one that would continue your poor servant, And cannot live that day in which she is Deni'd to be so: Can Mirtilla sit Mourning alone, imagining those pleasures Which you this blessed Hymeneal night Enjoy in the embraces of your Lord, And my Lord too in being yours, (already As such I love and honor him) shall a stranger Sew you in a sheet to guard that maidenhead You must pretend to keep, (and 'twill become you.) Shall another do those bridal offices Which time will not permit me to remember, And I pine here with envy? Pardon me, I must and will be pardon'd, for my passions Are in extreams, and use some speedy means That I may go along with you, and share In those delights, but with becoming distance; Or by his life, which as a Saint you swear by, I will discover all. Calist. Thou canst not be So treacherous and cruel, in destroying The building thou hast rais'd. Mirt. Pray you do not tempt me, for 'tis resolv'd. Calist. I know not what to think of't. In the discovery of my secrets to her, I have made my slave my Mistress, I must sooth her, There's no evasion else. Prethee Mirtilla, Be not so violent, I am strangely taken With thy affection to me, 'twas my purpose To have thee sent for. Mirt. When? Calist. This very night, and I vow deeply I shall be no sooner In the desir'd possession of my Lord; But by some of his servants I will have thee Convey'd unto us. Mirt. Should you break? Calist. I dare not: Come, clear thy looks, for instantly we'll prepare For our departure. Mirt. Pray you forgive my boldness, Growing from my excess of zeal to serve you. Calist. I thank thee for't. Mirt. You'll keep your word. Calist. Still doubtful? Mirt. 'Twas this I aim'd at, and leave the rest to Fortune. Exeunt. Enter Adorio, Camillo, Lentulo, Donato, Cario, Servants. Ador. Haste you unto my Villa, and take all Provision along with you; and for use, And ornament, the shortness of the time Can furnish you; let my best Plate be set out, And costliest Hangings, and if't be possible With a merry dance to entertain the Bride, Provide an Epithalamium. Car. Trust me for belly timber, and for a song I have A Paper blurrer; who on all occasions, For all times, and all seasons, hath such trinckets Ready i'th' deck. It is but altering The names, and they will serve for any Bride, Or Bridegroom in the Kingdom. Ador. But for the dance? Car. I will make one my self, and foot it finely, And summoning your Tenants at my Dresser, Which is indeed my Drum. Make a rare choice Of th'able youth, such as shall sweat sufficiently, And smell too, but not of Amber, which you know is The grace of the Country-hall. Ador. About it Cario, and look you be careful. Car. For mine own credit Sir. Exit. Ador. Now noble friends confirm your loves, and think not Of the penalty of the Law, that does forbid The stealing away an Heir. I will secure you, And pay the breach of't. Cam. Tell us what we shall do, we'll talk of that hereafter. Ador. Pray you be carefull To keep the West-gate of the City open, That our passage may be free, and bribe the Watch With any sum; this is all. Don. A dangerous business. Cam. I'll make the Constable, Watch, and Porter drunk, Under a Crown. Lent. And then you may pass while they snore, Though you had done a murther. Cam. Get but your Mistress, And leave the rest to us. Ador. You much engage me, But I forget my self. Cam. Pray you in what, Sir? Ador. Yielding too much to my affection, Though lawful now, my wounded reputation And honor suffer: The disgrace in taking A blow in publike from Caldoro, branded With the infamous mark of Coward, in delaying To right my self, upon my cheek grows fresher, That's first to be consider'd. Cam. If you dare Trust my opinion, (yet I have had Some practice and experience in duels) You are too tender that way: Can you answer The debt you owe your honor, till you meet Your Enemy from whom you may exact it? Hath he not left the City, and in fear Conceal'd himself, for ought I can imagine? What would you more? Ador. I should do. Cam. Never think on't Till fitter time and place invite you to it. I have read Caranza, and find not in his Grammar Of Quarrels, that the injur'd man is bound To seek for reparation at an hour; But may, and without loss, till he hath setled More serious occasions that import him, For a day or two defer it. Ador. You'll subscribe Your hand to this? Cam. And justifie't with my life, Presume upon't. Ador. On then, you shall overrule me. Exeunt. Enter Jolante and Calypso. Jol. I'll give thee a golden tongue, and have it hung up Ore thy tomb for a monument. Cal. I am not prepar'd yet To leave the world; there are many good pranks I must dispatch in this kind before I die: And I had rather, if your Honor please, Have the crowns in my purse. Jol. Take that. Cal. Magnificent Lady! May you live long, and every Moon love change, That I may have fresh imployment. You know what Remains to be done. Jol. Yes, yes, I will command My daughter and Mirtilla to their chamber. Cal. And lock 'em up: Such liquorish Kitlings are not To be trusted with our cream. Ere I go, I'll help you To set forth the banquet, and place the candid Eringo's Where he may be sure to taste 'em. Then undress you, For these things are cumbersom, when you should be active: A thine night mantle to hide part of your Smock, With your Pearl embroider'd Pantophles on your Feet, And then you are arm'd for service; nay, no trifling, We are alone, and you know 'tis a point of folly To be coy to eat, when meat is set before you. Exeunt: Enter Adorio, and Servant. Ador. 'Tis eleven by my Watch, the hour appointed. Listen at the door; hears't thou any stirring? Serv. No Sir, all's silent here. Ador. Some cursed business keeps Her mother up. I'll walk a little circle, And shew where you shall wait us with the horses, And then return. This short delay afflicts me, And I presume, to her it is not pleasing. Exeunt. Enter Durazzo, Caldoro. Dur. What's now to be done? prethee let's to Bed, I am sleep. And here's my hand on't without more ado, By fair or foul play, we'll have her to morrow In thy possession. Cald. Good Sir give me leave To taste a little comfort in beholding The place by her sweet presence sanctifi'd. She may perhaps to take air, ope the Casement, And looking out, a new Star to be gaz'd on By me with adoration, bless these eyes. Ne'er happy but when she is made the Object. Dur. Is not here fine fooling. Caldo. Thou great Queen of Love, Or real or imagin'd, be propitious To me thy faithful Votary; and I vow T'erect a statue to thee, equal to Thy picture by Apelles skilful hand Left as the great example of his art; And on thy thigh I'll hang a golden Cupid, His torches flaming, and his quiver full, For further honour. Dur. End this waking dream, and let's away Mirtilla! Enter Caliste and Mirtilla. Cald. 'Tis her voice. Cal. You heard the horses footing. Mirt. Certainly. Cal. Speak low, my Lord Adorio: Cald. I am dumb. Dur. The darkness friend us too, most honour'd Madam, Adorio your servant. Cal. As you are so, I do command your silence till we are Further remov'd; and let this kiss assure you, (I thank the sable night that hides my blushes) I am wholly yours. Dur. Forward you micher. Mirt. Madam, think on Mirtilla. [Goes in] Dur. I'll not now enquire The mysterie of this, but bless kind Fortune Favoring us beyond our hopes: yet now I think on't. I had ever a lucky hand in such smock night-work. Exeunt. Enter Adorio and Servant. Ador. This slowness does amaze me; she's not alter'd In her late resolution. [Within Jolant.] Get you to bed, And stir not on your life, till I command you. Ador. Her mothers voice! listen. Serv. Here comes the daughter. Enter Mirtilla. Mirt. Whither shall I flie for succor? Ador. To these arms, your castle of defence, impregnable, And not to be blown up. How your heart beats! Take comfort, dear Caliste, you are now In his protection that will nere forsake you, Adorio: Your chang'd Adorio swears By your best self, an oath he dares not break, He loves you, loves you in a noble way, His constancie firm as the poles of heaven. I will urge no reply, silence becomes you, And I'll defer the musick of your voice Till we are in a place of safety. Mirt. O blest error! Exeunt. Enter Severino. 'Tis midnight: how my fears of certain death Being surpris'd, combat with my strong hopes Rais'd on my chaste wifes goodness! I am grown A stranger in this City, and no wonder, I have too long been so unto my self: Grant me a little truce, my troubled soul, I hear some footing, ha? Enter Monteclaro and Calypso. Calyp. That is the house, And there's the key; you'll find my Lady ready To entertain you: 'tis not fit I should Stand gaping by while you bill: I have brought you on, Charge home, and come off with honor. Exit. Sever. It makes this way. Mont. I am much troubled, and know not what to think Of this design. Sever. It still comes on. Mont. The Watch! I am betraid. Sever. Should I now appear fearful, It would discover me; there is no retiring, My confidence must protect me, I'll appear As if I walk'd the round. Stand. Mont. I am lost. Sever. The word? Mont. Pray you forbear; I am a stranger, And missing this dark stormy night my way To my lodging, you shall do a courteous office To guide me to't. Sever. Do you think I stand here for a page or a porter? Mont. Good sir grow not so high, I can justifie my being abroad; I am No pilfering vagabond, and what you are Stands yet in supposition; and I charge you If you are an Officer, bring me before your Captain; For if you do assault me, though not in fear Of what you can do alone, I will cry murther And raise the streets. Sever. Before my Captain, ha? And bring my head to the block. Would we were parted, I have greater cause to fear the Watch then he. Mont. Will you do your duty? Sever. I must close with him: Truth sir, whatere you are, (yet by your language I ghess you a Gentleman) I'll not use the rigor Of my place upon you; only quit this street, For your stay here will be dangerous, and good night. Mont. The like to you sir; I'll grope out my way As well as I can. O damn'd Bawd! fare you well sir. Exit Monteclaro. Sever. I am glad he's gone; there is a secret passage Unknown to my wife, through which this key will guide me To her desired imbraces, which must be, My presence being beyond her hopes, most welcom. Exit. Enter Jolante (with a rich banquet, and tapers) (in a chair, behind a curtain.) Jol. I am full of perplexed thoughts: Imperious Blood, Thou only art a tyrant; Judgment, Reason, To whatsoever thy Edicts proclaim, With vassal fear subscribe against themselves. I am yet safe in the port, and see before me, If I put off, a rough tempestuous sea, The raging winds of infamy from all quarters Assuring my destruction; yet my lust Swelling the wanton sails, (my understanding (Stow'd under hatches) like a desperate Pilot Commands me to urge on: My pride, my pride, Self-love, and over-value of my self Are justly punish'd: I that did deny My daughters youth allow'd and lawful pleasures, And would not suffer in her those desires She suck'd in with my milk, now in my waning Am scorcht and burnt up with libidinous fire That must consume my fame; yet still I throw More fuel on it. Enter Severino. Sever. 'Tis her voice, poor Turtle; She's now at her devotions praying for Her banished Mate: alas, that for my guilt Her innocence should suffer! But I do Commit a second sin in my deferring The extasie of joy that will transport her Beyond herself, when she flies to my lips, And seals my welcom. Jolante! Jol. Ha? good Angels guard me. Sever. What do I behold? Some sudden flash of lightning strike me blind, Or cleave the center of the earth, that I May living find a sepulchre to swallow Me and my shame together. Jol. Guilt and horror Confound me in one instant; thus surpris'd, The subtlety of all Wantons, though abstracted, Can shew no seeming colour of excuse To plead in my defence. Sever. Is this her mourning? O killing object! the imprison'd vapours Of rage and sorrow make an earthquake in me: This little world, like to a tottering tower, Not to be underpropp'd; yet in my fall I'll crush thee with my ruines. Draws a poniard, she kneels. Jol. Good sir, hold: For, my defence unheard, you wrong your justice, If you proceed to execution, And will too late repent it. Sever. Thy defence? To move it, adds (could it receive addition) Ugliness to the loathsom leprosie That in thy being a Strumpet hath already Infected every vein, and spreads it self Over this carrion, which would poison Vulturs and dogs, should they devour it. Yet to stamp The seal of Reprobation on thy soul, I'll hear thy impudent lyes borrow'd from hell And prompted by the Devil thy tutor, Whore, Then send thee to him. Speak. Jol. Your Gorgon looks Turn me to stone, and a dead palsie seises My silenc'd tongue. Sever. O fate, that the disease Were general in women; what a calm Should wretched men enjoy! Speak, and be brief, Or thou shalt suddenly feel me. Jol. Be appeas'd sir, Until I have deliver'd reasons for This solemn preparation. Sever. On, I hear thee. Jol. With patience ask your memory; 'twill instruct you, This very day of the moneth 17 years since You married me. Sever. Grant it, what canst thou urge from this? Jol. That day since your proscription sir, In the rembrance of it annually, The garments of my sorrow laid aside, I have with pomp observ'd. Sever. Alone! Jol. The thoughts of my felicity then, my misery now, Were the invited guests; Imagination Teaching me to believe that you were present And a partner in it. Sever. Rare! this real banquet To feast your fancie: Fiend, could Fancie drink off These flagons to my health? or th'idol Thought Like Baal devour these delicates? the room Perfum'd to take his nostrils? this loose habit Which Messalina would not wear, put on To fire his lustful eyes? Wretch, am I grown So weak in thy opinion, that it can Flatter credulity that these gross tricks May be foisted on me? Where's my daughter? where The Bawd your woman? answer me, Caliste, Mirtilla! they are dispos'd of, if not murther'd, To make all sure; and yet methinks your neighbour, Your whistle, agent, parasite Calypso, Should be within: Call when you hem to usher in The close Adulterer. Jol. What will you do? Sever. Not kill thee, do not hope it, I am not So near to reconcilement. Ha! this scarf Th'intended favor to your Stallion, now Is useful: do not strive; thus bound expect All studied tortures, my assurance, not My jealousie thou art false, can pour upon thee. In darkness howl thy mischiefs; and if rankness Of thy imagination can conjure The Ribaud, glut thy self with him: I will cry aim, and in another room Determine of my vengeance. Oh my heart-strings! Exit (with tapers.) Jol. Most miserable woman! and yet sitting A Judge in mine own cause upon my self, I could not mitigate the heavy doom My incens'd husband must pronounce upon me. In my intents I am guilty, and for them Must suffer the same punishment, as if I had in fact offended. [Calypso speaks at the door.] Bore my eyes out If you prove me faulty: I'll but tell my Lady What caus'd your stay, and instantly present you. How's this? no lights? what new device? will she play At Blindman-buff Madam? Jol. Upon thy life speak in a lower key: Calyp. The mysterie Of this sweet Lady; where are you? Jol. Here fast bound. Calyp. By whom? Jol. I'll whisper that into thine ear, and then farewell for ever. Calyp. How? my Lord, I am in a fever: Horns upon horns grow on him. Could he pick no hour but this to break a bargain Almost made up? Jol. What shall we do? Calyp. Betray him; I'll instantly raise the Watch. Jol. And so make me for ever infamous. Calyp. The Gentleman, the rarest Gentleman is at the door, Shall he lose his labour? since that you must perish, 'Twill shew a womans spleen in you to fall Deservedly: give him his answer, Madam. I have on the sudden in my head a strange whimsie, But I will first unbind you. Jol. Now what follows? Cal. I will supply your place; and bound, give me Your mantle, take my night-gown, send away The Gentleman satisfied. I know my Lord Wants power to hurt you: I perhaps may get A kiss by the bargain, and all this may prove But some neat love-trick: If he should grow furious And question me, I am resolv'd to put on An obstinate silence. Pray you dispatch the Gent. His courage may cool. Jol. I'll speak with him; but if To any base or lustful end, may mercy At my last gasp forsake me. Exit. Calyp. I was too rash, And have done what I wish undone: say he should kill me, I have run my head in a fine nooze, and I smell The pickle I am in: 'las how I shudder Still more and more! would I were a she-Priapus, Stuck up in a garden to fright away the Crows, So I were out of the house; she's at her pleasure Whatere she said, and I must endure the torture. He comes; I cannot pray, my fear will kill me. Enter Severino (throwing open the doors violently) having a knife. Sev. It is a deed of darkness, and I need No light to guide me: there is something tels me I am too slow pac'd in my wreak, and trifle In my revenge. All hush'd? no sigh nor groan To witness her compunction? can guilt sleep, And innocence be open-ey'd? Even now Perhaps she dreams of the Adulterer, And in her fancie hugs him: Wake thou strumpet, And instantly give up unto my vengeance The villain that defiles my bed; discover Both what and where he is, and suddenly That I may bind you face to face, then sew you Into one sack, and from some steep rock hurl you Into the sea together: Do not play with The lightning of my rage; break stubborn silence, And answer my demands, will it not be? I'll talk no longer; thus I mark thee for A common strumpet. Calyp. Oh! Sever. Thus stab these arms That have stretch'd out themselves to grasp a stranger. Calyp. Oh! Sever. This is but an induction; I'll draw The curtains of the Tragedy hereafter: Howl on, 'tis musick to me. Exit Severino. Calyp. He is gone, A kiss and love-tricks; he hath villainous teeth, May sublim'd Mercury draw 'em. If all dealers In my profession were paid thus, there would be A dearth of Cuckolds. Oh my nose! I had one, My arms, my arms! I dare not cry for fear: Cursed desire of gold, how art thou punish'd? Enter Jolante. Jol. Till now I never truly knew my self, Nor by all principles and lectures read In Chastities cold school was so instructed As by her contrary. How base and deform'd Loose appetite is! as in a few short minutes This stranger hath, and feelingly, deliver'd. Oh that I could recall my bad intentions, And be as I was yesterday untainted In my desires, as I am still in fact (I thank his temperance) I could look undanted Upon my husbands rage, and smile at it; So strong the guards, and sure defences are Of armed Innocence; but I will endure The penance of my sin, the onely means, Is left to purge it. The day breaks, Calypso. Calyp. Here Madam, here: Jol. Hath my Lord visited thee? Calyp. Hell take such visits; these stab'd arms, and loss Of my nose, you left fast on, may give you a rellish What a night I have had of't, and what you had suffered, Had I not supplied your place. Jol. I truly grieve for't; did not my husband speak to thee? Calyp. Yes, I heard him And felt him ecce signum, with a mischief, But he knew not me; like a true bred Spartan Fox With silence I endured it, he could not get One syllable from me Jol. Something may be fashion'd From this invention: Help me, I must be sudden, Thou art free, exchange, quick, quick, now binde me sure, And leave me to my fortune. Calyp. Pray you consider, The loss of my nose; had I been but carted for you, Though wash'd with Mire and Chamber-ly, I had Examples to excuse me; but my nose, my nose dear Lady. Exit. Jol. Get off, I'll send to thee. If so, it may take; if it fail, I must Suffer what ever follows. Enter Severino (with a Taper.) Sever. I have searched In every corner of the house, yet finde not My daughter, nor her Maid, nor any print Of a mans footing, which this wet night would Be easily discern'd, the ground being soft, At his coming in or going out. Jol. 'Tis he, and I am within hearing; Heaven forgive this feigning, I being forc'd to't to preserve my life, To be better spent hereafter. Sever. I begin to stagger, and my love if it knew how, Her piety heretofore, and fame remembred, Would plead in her excuse. Jol. You blessed Guardians Of matrimonial faith, and just revengers Of such as do in fact offend against Your sacred rites and ceremonies; by all titles And holy attributes you do vouchsafe To be invok'd, look down with saving pitty Upon my matchless sufferings. Sever. At her devotions, affliction makes her repent. Jol. Look down upon a wretched woman; and as I Have kept the knot of wedlock, in the Temple By the Priest fasten'd firm, (though in loose wishes I yield I have offended) to strike blind The eyes of Jealousie that see a crime I never yet committed, and to free me From the unjust suspition of my Lord, Restore my martyr'd face and wounded arms To their late strength and beauty. Sever. Does she hope to be cur'd by miracle? Jol. This minute I Perceive with joy my orisons heard and granted: You ministers of mercy, who unseen, And by a supernatural means have done This work of heavenly charity, be ever canoniz'd for't. Sever. I did not dream, I heard her, And I have eyes too, they cannot deceive me. If I have no belief in their assurance, I must turn sceptick. Ha? this is the hand? And this the fatal instrument? these drops Of blood, that gush'd forth from her face and arms, Still fresh upon the floor: This is something more Then wonder or amazement, I profess I am astonish'd. Jol. Be incredulous still, And go on in your barbarous rage, led to it By your false guide Suspition, have no faith In my so long try'd loyalty, nor believe That which you see; and for your satisfaction, My doubted innocence cleared by miracle, Proceed, these Veins have now new blood, if you Resolve to let it out. Sever. I would not be fool'd With easiness of belief, and faintly give Aside. Credit to this strange wonder? 'tis now thought on In a fitter place and time, I'll sound this further. Unties her. How can I expect my sin? or hope, Though now I write my self thy slave, the service Of my whole life can win thee to pronounce Despair'd of pardon? shall I kneel? that's poor, Thy mercy must urge more in my defence, Then I can fancy; wil't thou have revenge? My heart lies open to thee. Jol. This is needless to me, who in the duty of a wife, Know I must suffer. Sever. Thou art made up of goodness, And from my confidence that I am alone, The object of thy pleasures, until death Divorce us, we will know no separation Without inquiring why (as sure thou wilt not, Such is thy meek obedience) thy Jewels And choicest ornaments pack'd up, thou shalt Along with me; and as a Queen be honor'd By such a stile me Soveraign, already My banishment is repeal'd, thou being present: The Neapolitan Court a place of exile When thou art absent; my stay here is mortal Of which thou art to sensible, I perceive it. Come dearest Jolante, with this breath All jealousie is blown away. Jol. Be constant. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. ScÃ¦n. 1. A noyse within, as the fall of a Horse,âthen Enter Durazzo, Caldoro, Caliste, Servant. Duraz. Hell take the stumbling Jade. Cald. Heaven help the Lady. Serv. The Horse hath broke his neck. Duraz. Would thine were crack'd too So the Lady had no harm. Give her fresh air, 'Tis but a swoun. Cald. 'Tis more, she's dead. Duraz. Examine Her limbs if they be whole: not too high, not too high You Ferrit, this is no Cunniborough for you. How do you finde her? Cald. No breath of comfort sir, too cruel fate! Had I still pin'd away, and lingred under The modesty of just and honest hopes After a long consumption, sleep and death, To me had been the same, but now as 'twere Possess'd of all my wishes, in a moment To have 'em ravished from me? suffer shipwrack In view of the Port? and like a half starv'd begger, No sooner in compassion cloath'd, but coffin'd? Malevolent destinies, too cunning in Wretched Caldoro's tortures. O Caliste, If thy immortal part hath not already Left this fair pallace, let a beam of light Dawn from thine eye, in this Cimmerian darkness, To guide my shaking hand to touch the anchor Of hope in thy recovery. Caliste. Oh. Duraz. She lives, disturb her not, she is no right bred woman If she die with one fall; some of my acquaintance Have took a thousand merrily, and are still Excellent wrestlers at the close hug. Cald. Good Sir. Duraz. Prethee be not angry, I should speak thus if My Mother were in her place. Cald. But had you heard The musick of the language which she us'd To me, believ'd Adorio, as she rode Behinde me; little thinking that she did Embrace Caldoro. Caliste. Ah Adorio! Duraz. Leave talking, I conceive it. Caliste. Are you safe? Cald. And rais'd like you from death to life to hear you. Calist. Hear my defence then, ere I take my vail off, A simple maids defence, which looking on you, I faintly could deliver; willingly I am become your prize, and therefore use Your victory nobly; Heavens bright eye, the Sun, Draws up the grossest vapors, and I hope I ne'er shall prove an envious cloud to darken The splendor of your merits. I could urge With what disdain, nay scorn, I have declin'd The shadows of insinuating pleasures Tender'd by all men else, you onely being The object of my hopes: That cruel Prince To whom the Olive branch of Peace is offer'd, Is not a conqueror, but a bloody tyrant, If he refuse it; nor should you wish a triumph, Because Caliste's humble; I have said And now expect your sentence. Duraz. What a throng Of Clients would be in the Court of Love, Were there many such she Advocates: Art thou dumb? Canst thou say nothing for thy self. Cald. Dear Lady open your eyes, and look upon the man, The man you have elected for your Judge, Kneeling to you for mercy. Cal. I should know this voice, and something more then fear I am Deceiv'd, but now I look upon his face, I am assur'd I am wretched. Duraz. Why good Lady? Hold her up, she'll fall agen, before her time else, The youth's a well timbred youth, look on his making; His Hair curl'd naturally, he's whole chested too, And will do his work as well, and go through stitch with't, As any Adorio in the world; my state on't, A Chicken of the right kinde; and if he prove not A Cock of the Game, cuckold him first, and after Make a Capon of him. Caliste. I'll cry out a Rape, If thou unhand me not; would I had died In my late trance, and never liv'd to know I am betray'd. Duraz. To a yong and active husband, Call you that trechery; there are a shole of Yong wenches i'th' City, would vow a pilgrimage Beyond Jerusalem; to be so cheated. To her agen you milk-sop, violent storms Are soon blown over. Caliste. How could'st thou Caldoro With such a frontless impudence, arm thy hopes So far, as to believe I might consent To this leud practise? have I not often told thee How, ere I pitied thy misplaced affection, I could not answer it? and that there was A strong antipathy between our Passions, Not to be reconcil'd. Cald. Vouchsafe to hear me With an impartial ear, and it will take from The rigor of your censure. Man was mark'd A friend in his Creation to himself, And may with fit ambition conceive The greatest blessings, and the highest honors Appointed for him, if he can atchieve 'em The right and noble way: I grant you were The end of my design, but still pursu'd With a becoming modesty, Heaven at length Being pleas'd, and not my arts to further it. Duraz. Now he comes to her: On boy. Cald. I have serv'd you With a religious zeal, and borne the burthen Of your neglect (if I may call it so) Beyond the patience of a man, to prove this. I have seen those eyes with pleasant glances play Upon Adorio's, like PhÅbe's shine Guilding a Chrystal River, and your Lip Rise up in civil courtship to meet his, While I bit mine with envy: Yet these favors (How ere my passions rag'd) could not provoke me To one act of rebellion against My loyalty to you; the soveraign To whom I ow obedience. Calist. My blushes confefs this for a truth. Duraz. A flag of truce is Hung out in this acknowledgment. Cald. I could adde, But that you may interpret what I speak, The malice of a rival, rather then My due respect to your deserts. How faintly Adorio hath return'd thanks to the bounty Of your affection, ascribing it As a tribute to his worth, and not in you An act of mercy: Could he else invited (As by your words I understood) to take you To his protection, grosly neglect So gratious an offer? or give power To fate it self to cross him? O dear Madam, We are all the Balls of time, toss'd to and fro, From the Plough unto the Throne, and back agen, Under the swinge of destinie mankinde suffers; And it appears by an unchang'd decree You were appointed mine; wise nature always Aiming at due proportion, and if so, I may believe with confidence, Heaven in pity Of my sincere affection, and long patience, Directed you by a most blessed error To your vow'd servants bosom. Duraz. By my holidame Tickling-Philosophy. Calist. I am Sir, too weak To argue with you; but my Stars have better (I hope) provided for me. Cald. If there be Disparity between us, 'tis in your Compassion to level it. Duraz. Give fire to the Mine, and blow her up. Caliste. I am sensible Of what you have endured, but on the sudden, With my unusual travel, and late bruise, I am exceeding weary; in yon grove, While I repose my self, be you my guard: My spirits with some little rest reviv'd, We will consider further: For my part You shall receive modest and gentle answers To your demands, though short perhaps to make you Full satisfaction. Cald. I am exalted in the employment, sleep secure, I'll be Your vigilant Sentinel. Calist. But I command you, And as you hope for future grace obey me, Presume not with one stoln kiss to disturb The quiet of my slumbers; let your temperance And not your lust, watch over me. Cald. My desires Are frozen, till your pitty shall dissolve 'em. Duraz. Frozen! think not of Frost fool in the Dog-days, Remember the old adage, and make use of't, Occasion's bald behinde. Calist. Is this your Uncle? Cald. And Guardian, Madam; at your better leisure, When I have deserv'd it, you may give him thanks For his many favours to me. Calist. He appears a pleasant Gentleman. Ex. Caldoro and Caliste. Dur. You should find me so, But that I do hate incest. I grow heavy, Sirra provide fresh horses; I'll seek out Some hollow tree, and dream till you return, Which I charge you to hasten. Serv. With all care sir. Exeunt. Enter Cario and Country-men, (for the Dance and Song.) Car. Let your eyes be rivetted to my heels, and miss not A hairs breadth of my footing; our Dance has A most melodious note, and I command you To have ears like hares this night for my Lords honor, And something for my Worship: your reward is To be drunk blind like Moles in the Wine-cellar, And though you ne'r see after, 'tis the better, You were born for this nights service: And do you hear, Wire-string and Cats-guts men, and strong-breath'd Hoboys, For the credit of your calling, have not your Instruments To tune, when you should strike up; but twang it perfectly, As you would read your Neckverse; and you Warbler Keep your Wind-pipe moist, that you may not spit and hem, When you should make division. How I sweat! Authority is troublesom.âThey are come, I know it by the Cornet that I plac'd On the hill to give me notice: Marshal your selves I'the Rear, the Van is yours. Now chant it spritely. Enter Adorio, Mirtilla, Camillo, Lentulo, Donato Ador. A well-penn'd Ditty. [Song] Cam. Not ill sung. Ador. What follows? Car. Use your eyes; if ever, now your masterpiece [Dance] Ador. 'Tis well perform'd, take that, but not from me, 'Tis your new Ladies bounty, thank her for't, All that I have is hers. Car. I must have three shares For my pains and properties, the rest shall be Divided equally. Ex. Cario &amp; Rustici. Mirt. My real fears Begin, and soon my painted comforts vanish In my discovery. Ador. Welcome to your own: You have (a wonder in a woman) kept Three long hours silence; and the greater, holding Your own choice in your arms, a blessing for which I will be thankfull to you, nay unmask And let mine eye and ears together feast, Too long by you kept empty: Oh you want Your womans help, I'll do her office for you. Puls off her mask. Mirtilla! Cam. It is she, and wears the habit In which Caliste three days since appeared As she came from the Temple. Lent. All this trouble for a poor Waiting-maid? Don. We are grossly gull'd. Ador. Thou child of impudence, answer me, and truly, Or though the tongues of Angels pleaded mercy, Tortures shall force it from thee. Mirt. Innocence is free and open breasted; of what crime Stand I accus'd, my Lord? Ador. What crime? no language Can speak it to the height, I shall become Discourse for fools, and drunkards. How was this Contriv'd? who help'd thee in the plot? discover. Were not Caliste's aydes in't? Mirt. No on my life; nor am I faulty. Ador. No: what maygames this. Didst thou treat with me for thy Mistriss favors, To make sale of thine own? Mirt. With her and you I have dealt faithfully: you had her Letter With the Jewel I presented; she receiv'd Your courteous answer, and prepar'd herself To be remov'd by you: And howsoever You take delight to hear what you have done, From my simplicity, and make my weakness The subject of your mirth, as it suits well With my condition, I know you have her In your possession. Ador. How! has she left her mothers house? Mirt. You drive this nail too far; Indeed she deeply vow'd at her departure To send some of your Lordships servants for me, (Though you were pleas'd to take the pains your self) That I might still be near her, as a shadow To follow her the substance. Ador. She is gone then? Mirt. This is too much; but good my Lord forgive me, I come a Virgin hither to attend My noble Mistress, though I must confess I look with sore eyes upon her good fortune, And wish it were mine own: Ador. Then as it seems you do yourself affect me? Mirt. Should she hear me, And in her sudden fury kill me for't, I durst not, Sir, deny it; since you are A man so form'd, that not poor I alone, But all our sex like me I think stand bound To be enamour'd of you. Ador. O my fate! how justly am I punish'd? in thee punish'd For my defended wantonness? I that scorn'd The Mistress when she sought me, now I would Upon my knees receive her, am become A prey unto her Bondwoman, My honor too neglected for this purchase. Art thou one of those Ambitious Serving-women, who contemning Th'embraces of their Equals, aim to be The wrong way Ladifi'd by a Lord? was there No forward Page or Footman in the City To do the feat, that in thy lust I am chosen To be the executioner? dar'st thou hope I can descend so low? Mirt. Great Lords sometimes For change leave calvert Sammon, and eat Sprats, In modesty I dare speak no more. Cam. If 'twere a Fish-day, though you like it not, I could say I have a stomach, and would content my self With this pretty Whiting-mop. Ador. Discover yet how thou cam'st to my hands. Mirt. My Lady gone, Fear of her mothers rage, she being found absent, Mov'd me to flie; and quitting of the house, You were pleas'd unask'd to comfort me, I us'd No sorceries to bewitch you; then vouchsaf'd (Thanks ever to the darkness of the night) To hug me in your arms, and I had wrong'd My breeding near the Court, had I refus'd it. Ador. This is still more bitter; canst thou ghess to whom Thy Lady did commit herself? Mirt. They were horsemen, as you are. Ador. In the name of wonder, How could they pass the Port, where you expected My coming? Cam. Now I think upon't, there came Three mounted by, and behind one a woman Embracing fast the man that rode before her. Lent. I knew the men, but she was vail'd. Ador. What were they? Lent. The first the Lord Durazzo, and the second Your rival yong Caldoro; it was he That carried the wench behinde him. Donat. The last a servant that spur'd fast after 'em. Ador. Worse and worse! 'twas she! Too much assurance of her love undid me; Why did you not stay 'em? Donat. We had no such commission. Camil. Or say we had? who durst lay fingers on The angry old Ruffian. Lent. For my part I had rather Take a baited Bull by the Horns. Ador. You are sure friends for a man to build on. Camil. They are not far off, Their horses appeared spent too; lets take fresh ones And coast the Countrey, ten to one we finde 'em. Ador. I will not eat nor sleep, until I have 'em. Moppet you shall along too. Mirt. So you please, I may keep my place behinde you; I'll sit fast, and ride with you all the world over. Camil. A good Girle. Exeunt. Enter Monteclaro and Calypso. Mont. Her husband Severino? Calyp. You may see His handy-work by my flat face; no bridge Left to support my Organ. If I had one, The comfort is I am now secure from the Grincomes, I can loose nothing that way. Monte. Doest thou not know what became of the Lady? Calyp. A nose was enough to part with I think, in the service; I durst stay no longer, But I am full assur'd the house is empty, Neither poor Lady, daughter, servant left there: I only ghess he hath forc'd 'em to go with him To the dangerous Forrest where he lives like a King Among the Banditi, and how there he hath us'd them, Is more then to be fear'd. Mont. I have plaid the fool, And kept my self too long conceal'd, sans question With the danger of her life. Leave meâ The King! Enter Alphonso and Captain. Cal. The Surgeon must be paid. Mont. Take that. Cal. I thank you, I have got enough by my trade, and I will build An Hospital only for noseless Bawds, 'Twill speak my charity, and be my self The Governess of the Sisterhood. Exit. Alph. I may forget this in your vigilance hereafter; But as I am a King, if you provoke me The second time with negligence of this kind, You shall deeply smart for't. Mont. The King's mov'd. Alph. To suffer a murtherer by us proscrib'd, at his pleasure To pass and repass through our guards? Capt. Your pardon For this, my gracious Lord, binds me to be More circumspect hereafter. Alph. Look you be so: Monsieur Laval, you were a suiter to me For Severino's pardon. Mont. I was so, my good Lord. Alph. You might have met him here to have thank'd You for't, as now I understand. Mont. So it is rumour'd; And hearing in the City of his boldness, (I would not say contempt of your Decrees) As then I pleaded mercy, (under pardon) I now as much admire the slowness of Your justice (though it force you to some trouble) In fetching him in. Alph. I have consider'd it. Mont. He hath of late, as 'tis suspected, done An outrage on his wife, forgetting nature To his own daughter, in whom sir I have Some nearer interest then I stand bound to In my humanity, which I gladly would Make known unto your Highness. Alph. Go along, you shall have opportunity as we walk: See you what I committed to your charge, In readiness, and without noise. Capt. I shall sir. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Claudio, and all the Banditi (making a guard) Severino and Jolante (with Oaken-leav'd garlands) and Singers. Sever. Here, as a Queen, share in my soveraignty: The iron toils pitch'd by the Law to take The forfeiture of my life, I have broke through, And secure in the guards of these few subjects Smile at Alphonsus fury, though I grieve for The fatal cause in your good brothers loss That does compell me to his course. Jol. Revive not A sorrow long since dead, and so diminish The full fruition of those joys, which now I stand possess'd of: Womanish fear of danger That may pursue us, I shake off, and with A masculine spirit. Sev. 'Tis well said. Jol. In you sir I live; and when, or by the course of nature, Or violence you must fall, the end of my Devotions is, that one and the same hour May make us fit for heaven. Sev. I join with you In my votes that way: But how, Jolante, You that have spent your past days slumbring in The doun of quiet, can endure the hardness And rough condition of our present being, Does much disturb me. Jol. These woods, Severino, Shall more then seem to me a populous City; You being present, here are no allurements To tempt my frailty, nor the conversation Of such, whose choice behaviour or discourse May nourish jealous thoughts. Sev. True, Jolante, Nor shall suspected chastity stand in need here To be clear'd by miracle. Jol. Still on that string? it yields harsh discord. Sev. I had forgot my self, And wish I might no more remember it. The day wears, sirs, without one prize brought in As tribute to your Queen. Claudio, divide Our Squadron in small parties, let 'em watch All passages, that none escape without The payment of our Customs. Claud. Shall we bring in the persons with the pillage? Sev. By all means, Without reply about it, we'll retire Ex. Claudio and the rest. Into my Cave, and there at large discourse Our fortunes past, and study some apt means To find our daughter; since she well dispos'd of, Our happiness were perfect. Jol. We must wait with patience Heavens pleasure. Sev. 'Tis my purpose. Exeunt. Enter Lentulo and Camillo. Lent. Let the horses graze, they are spent, I am sure I am sleepy, And nodded as I rode: here was a jaunt I'th' dark through thick and thin, and all to no purpose: What a dulness grows upon me. Lent. I can hardly [They sit down] Hold ope mine eyes to say so. How did we lose Adorio? Cam. He, Donato, and the Wench That cleaves to him like bird-lime, took the right hand, But this place is our rendevouz. Lent. No matter, we'll talk of that anon,âheigh ho. [Sleeps] Cam. He's fast already, Lentulo; I'll take a nap too. [Sleeps] Enter Adorio, Mirtilla, Donato. Ador. Was ever man so crost? 1 Wom. So blest. This is the finest Wild-goose chase. Ador. What's that you mutter? Mirt. A short prayer, that you may find Your wish'd for love, though I am lost for ever. Don. Pretty fool, who have we here? Ador. This is Camillo. Mirt. This Signior Lentulo Ador. Wake 'em. Don. They'll not stir, Their eye-lids are glu'd, and mine too; by your favour, I'll follow their example. [Lies down] Ador. Are you not weary? Mirt. I know not what the word means, while I travel To do you service. Ador. You elect to reap The harvest of your flattery; but your hopes Will be blasted, I assure you. Mirt. So you give leave To sow it as in me a sign of duty, Though you deny your beams of gratious favor To ripen it, with patience I shall suffer. Ador. No more; my resolution to finde Caliste, by what accident lost, I know not, Binds me not to deny my self what nature Exacteth from me. To walk alone a foot (For my Horse is tir'd) were madness, I must sleep; You could lie down too. Mirt. Willingly; so you please to use me. Ador. Use thee? Mirt. As your pillow Sir, I dare presume no farther, noble Sir. Do not too much condemn me; generous feet, Spurn not a fawning Spaniel. Ador. Well! sit down. Mirt. I am ready Sir. Ador. So nimble? Mirt. Love is active; Nor would I be a slow thing: Rest secure Sir On my maiden-head, I'll not ravish you. Ador. For once, so far I'll trust you. Lies down on her Lap. Mirt. All the joys of rest Dwell on your eye-lids; let no dream disturb Your soft and gentle slumbers: I cannot sing, But I'll talk you asleep: And I beseech you Be not offended, though I glory in My being thus employ'd; a happiness That stands for more then ample satisfaction For all I have, or can endure. He snores, And does not hear me; would his sense of feeling Were bound up too: I shouldâI am all fire. Such heaps of treasure offer'd as a prey, Would tempt a modest theef; I can no longer Forbear. I'll gently touch his Lips, and leave Kisses him. No print of mine. Ah! I have heard of Nectar; But till now never tasted it: These Rubies Are not clouded by my breath. If once agen I steal, from such a full Exchequer, trifles Kisses agen. Will not be miss'd, I am entranc'd: our fancy Some say in sleep works stronger, I will prove How far myâ Sleeps. Enter Durazzo. Dur. My bones ake, I am exceeding cold too, I must seek out A more convenient Truckle-bed. Ha! Do I dream? No, no, I wake, Camillo, Lentulo, Donato this; and as I live, Adorio In a handsom wenches lap, a whoreson; you are The best accommodated, I will call My Nephew, and his Mistris to this Pageant. The object may perhaps do more upon her, Then all Caldoro's rhetorick. With what Security they sleep! sure Mercury Hath travel'd this way with his charming rod. Nephew, Caliste. Madam. Enter Caldoro and Caliste. Cald. Here Sir, is your man return'd with Horses. Dur. No Boy, no; but here are some you thought not of. Calist. Adorio. Dur. The Idol that you worshipped. Calist. This Mirtilla? I am made a stale: Dur. I knew 'twould take. Calist. False man; But much more treacherous woman, 'tis apparent, They joyntly did conspire against my weakness, And credulous simplicity, and have Prevail'd against it. Cald. I'll not kill 'em sleeping; But if you please, I'll wake 'em first, and after Offer them as a fatal sacrifice, to your just anger. Dur. You are a fool, reserve your blood for better uses. Calist. My fond love, is chang'd to an extremity of hate, His very sight is odious. Dur. I have thought of A pretty punishment for him, and his Comrades, Then leave him to his harlotry: If she prove not Torture enough, hold me an Ass. Their horses Are not far off, I'll cut the Girts and Bridles, Then turn 'em into the Wood; if they can run Let 'em follow us as footmen. Wilt thou fight For what's thine own already? Calist. In his Hat He wears a Jewel, which this faithless Strumpet As a salary of her Lust, deceiv'd me of, He shall not keep't to my disgrace, nor will I Stir till I have it. Dur. I am not good at niming; And yet that shall not hinder us, by your leave Sir, 'Tis restitution, pray you all bear witness I do not steal it; here 'tis. Calist. Take it not As a Mistris favor, but a strong assurance I am your wife. Cald. O Heaven. Duraz. Pray i'th' Church. Let us away, Nephew a word: have you not Been billing in the brakes? Ha, and so deserv'd This unexpected favor. Cald. You are pleasant. Exeunt Durazzo, Caldoro, Caliste. Ador. As thou art a Gentleman, kill me not basely, Starts up; the rest wake. Give me leave to draw my Sword. Camil. Ha? what's the matter? Lent. He talk'd of's Sword. Donat. I see no enemy near us, That threatens danger. Mirt. Sure 'twas but a dream. Ador. A fearful one. Me thought Caldoro's sword Was at my throat, Caliste frowning by, Commanding him, as he desir'd her favor, To strike my head off. Camil. Meer imagination of a disturbed fancy: Mirt. Here's your Hat Sir. Ador. But where my Jewel? Camil. By all likelihood lost, this troublesome night. Donat. I saw it when we came unto this place. Mirt. I look't upon't my self, when you repos'd. Ador. What is become of it? Restore it, for thou hast it, do not put me To the trouble to search you. Mirt. Search me? Ador. You have been Before your Lady gave you entertainment, A night-walker in the streets. Mirt. How, my good Lord? Ador. Traded in picking pockets, when tame gulls Charm'd with your prostituted flatteries, Dain'd to embrace you. Mirt. Love give place to anger. Charge me with theft, and prostituted baseness? Were you a Judge, nay more, the King; thus urg'd, To your teeth I would say, 'Tis false. Ador. This will not do. Camil. Deliver it in private. Mirt. You shall be In publick hang'd first, and the whole gang of you. I steal what I presented. Lent. Do not strive. Ador. Though thou hast swallow'd it, I'll rip thy entrail, But I'll recover it. Mirt. Help, help. Ador. A new plot. Enter Claudio, and two Banditi, (presenting their Pistols.) Claud. Forbear, libidinous Monsters; if you offer The least resistance, you are dead: if one But lay his hand upon his sword, shoot all. Ador. Let us fight for what we have, and if you can Win it, enjoy it. Claud. We come not to try Your valor, but for your money; throw down your sword, Or I'll begin with you: So if you will Walk quietly without bonds, you may, if not We'll force you; thou shalt have no wrong, But justice against these. 1. Bandit. We'll teach your Sir To meddle with wenches in our walks. 2. Bandit. It being against our Canons. Camil. Whether will you lead us? Claud. You shall know that hereafter: Guard 'em sure. Exeunt. Enter Alphonso, Monteclaro, Captain. Alpho. Are all the passages stopp'd? Cap. And strongly man'd, They must use wings, and flie, if they escape us. Monte. But why, great Sir, you should expose your person To such apparent danger, when you may Have 'em brought bound before you; is beyond My apprehension. Alpho. I am better arm'd Then you suppose: besides it is confirm'd By all that have been robb'd, since Severino Commanded these Banditi; though it be Unusual in Italy, imitating The courteous English Theeves, for so they call 'em, They have not done one murther: I must adde too, That from a strange relation I have heard Of Severino's Justice, in disposing The preys brought in, I would be an eye-witness Of what I take up now but on report: And therefore 'tis my pleasure that we should As soon as they encounter us, without A shew of opposition yield. Mont. Your will is not to be disputed. Alph. You have plac'd Your ambush so, that if there be occasion They suddenly may break in. Capt. My life upon't. Alph. We cannot travail far, but we shall meet With some of these good fellows; and be sure You do as I command you. Mont. Without fear, sir. Exeunt. Enter Severino and Jolante. Sev. 'Tis true, I did command Caliste should not Without my knowledg and consent, assisted By your advice, be married: but your Restraint, as you deliver it, denying A grown up Maid the modest conversation Of Men, and warrantable pleasures, relish'd Of too much rigor, which no doubt hath driven her To take some desperate course. Jol. What then I did, was in my care thought best. Sev. I so conceive it; But where was your discretion to forbid Access and fit approaches, when you knew Her Suiters noble, either of which I would Have wish'd my son in law? Adorio, However wild, a young man of good parts, But better fortunes: his Competitor Caldoro, for his sweetness of behaviour, Staidness and temperance, holding the first place Among the Gallants most observ'd in Naples; His own revenues of a large extent, But in the expectation of his Uncles And Guardians entrata's, by the course Of nature to descend on him, a Match For the best Subjects blood, I except none Of eminence in Italy. Jol. Your wishes, Howe'r a while delaid, are not I hope Impossibilities. Sev. Though it prove so, Yet 'tis not good to give a check to Fortune When she comes smiling to us.â Hark, this Cornet [Cornet within] Assures us of a prize; there sit in state, 'Tis thy first tribute. Jol. Would we might enjoy our own as Subjects: Sev. What's got by the sword, Is better then inheritance: All those Kingdoms Subdu'd by Alexander, were by force extorted, Though gilded ore with glorious stiles of conquest; His victories but royal robberies, And his true definition a Thief; When circled with huge Navies to the terror Of such as plough'd the Ocean, as the Pirate Who from a narrow Creek puts off for prey In a small Pinace, from a second place New spoil brought in,âfrom a third party, brave! This shall be registred a day of triumph Design'd by fate to honor thee.â âWelcome Claudio; Good booty, ha? Enter Claudio, Banditi, Adorio, Lentulo, Donato, Camillo, Mirtilla, (at one door) Banditi, Durazo, Caldoro, Caliste, (at another;) Alphonso, Monteclaro, Captain, and Banditi. Clau. Their outsides promise so, But yet they have not made discovery Of what they stand possest of. Sev. Welcome all Good boys; you have done bravely, if no blood Be shed in the service. 1 Band. On our lives no drop sir. Sev. 'Tis to my wish. Jol. My Lord! Sev. No more, I know 'em. Jol. My daughter and her woman too! Sev. Conceal your joys. Dur. Faln in the Devils mouth. Cal. My father, And mother! to what fate am I reserv'd? Cald. Continue masqu'd; or grant that you be known, From whom can you expect a gentle sentence, If you despair a Fathers? Ador. Now I perceive which way I lost my Jewel. Mirt. I rejoice I am clear'd from theft; you have done me wrong, But I unask'd forgive you. Dur. 'Tis some comfort yet The rivals, men and women, friends and foes, are Together in one toil. Sev. You all look pale, And by your private whisperings and soft murmurs Express a general fear: pray you shake it off; For understand you are not faln into The hands of a Busiris or a Cacus, Delighted more in blood then spoil; but given up To the power of an unfortunate Gentleman, Not born to these low courses, howsoere My fate, and just displeasure of the King Design'd me to it: you need not to doubt A sad captivity here, and much less fear For profit to be sold for slaves, then ship'd Into another Country; in a word, You know the proscrib'd Severino, he Not unacquainted, but familiar with The most of you: Want in my self I know not, But for the pay of these my Squires, who eat Their bread with danger purchas'd, and must be With others fleeces cloth'd, or live expos'd To the summers scorching heat and winters cold; To these before you be compell'd, (a word I speak with much unwillingness) deliver Such coin as you are furnish'd with. Duraz. A fine method! This is neither begging, borrowing, nor robbery, Yet it hath a twang of all of them. But one word Sir. Sever. Your pleasure. Duzar. When we have thrown down our Muck, what follows? Sever. Liberty, with a safe convoy, to any place you chuse. Duraz. By this hand you are A fair fraternity; for once I'll be The first example to relieve your Covent. There's a thousand crowns, my Vintage, Harvest, Profits Arising from my Herds, bound in one Bag, Share it among you. Sever. You are still the jovial, and good Durazzo. Duraz. To the Offering, nay, No hanging an arse, this is their wedding day. What you must do spight of your hearts, do freely For your own sakes. Camil. There's mine. They all throw down their purses. Lent. Mine. Donat. All that I have. Cald. This to preserve my Jewel. Ador. Which I challenge; Let me have justice, for my coin I care not. Mont. I will not weep for mine. Capt. Would it were more. Sev. Nay you are priviledg'd; but why old father Art thou so slow? thou hast one foot in the grave, And if desire of gold do not increase With thy expiring lease of life, thou shouldst Be forwardest. Alph. In what concerns my self, I do acknowledge it, and I should lie, (A vice I have detested from my youth) If I deny'd my present store, since what I have about me now, weighs down in value Almost a hundred fold, what ever these Have laid before you, see I do groan under Throws down three bags. The burthen of my treasure; nay 'tis Gold, And if your hunger of it be not sated With what already I have shewn unto you, Here's that shall glut it. In this Casket are Inestimable Jewels, Diamonds Of such a piercing lustre, as struck blinde Th'amazed Lapidary, while he labor'd To honor his own art in setting 'em. Opens the Casket. Some orient Pearls too, which the Queen of Spain Might wear as Earings, in remembrance of The day that she was crown'd. Sever. The spoils I think of both the Indies. Duraz. The great Sultans poor, If parallel'd with this CrÃ¦ssus. Sever. Why dost thou weep? Alpho. From a most fit consideration of My poverty, this though restor'd, will not Serve my occasions. Sever. Impossible. Duraz. May be he would buy his pasport up to Heaven, And then this too little, though in the journey It were a good Viaticum. Alpho. I would make it A means to help me thither; not to wrong you With tedious expectation, I'll discover What my wants are, and yield my reasons for 'em: I have two sons, twins, the true images Of what I was at their years; never father Had fairer, or more promising hopes in his Posterity: But alas, these sons ambitious Of glittering honor, and an after-name Atchiev'd by glorious, and yet pious actions, (For such were their intentions) put to sea: They had a well rigg'd Bottom, fully mann'd, An old experienc'd Master, lusty Sailers, Stout Land-men, and what's something more then rare, They did agree, had one design, and that was In charity to redeem the Christian slaves Chain'd to the Turkish servitude. Sev. A brave aim. Dur. A most heroique enterprise; I languish To hear how they succeeded. Alph. Prosperously At first, and to their wishes: divers Gallies They boarded, and some strong Forts near the shore They suddenly surpriz'd, a thousand Captives Redeem'd from th'oar, paid their glad vows &amp; prayrs For their deliverance, their ends acquir'd; And making homeward in triumphant manner, (For sure the cause deserv'd it.) Dur. Pray you end here, The best I fear is told, and that which follows Must conclude ill. Alph. Your fears are true, and yet I must with grief relate it; prodigal fame In every place with her loud trump proclaiming The greatness of the action; the Pyrates Of Tunis and Argiers laid wait for 'em At their return. To tell you what resistance They made, and how my poor sons fought, would but Increase my sorrow, and perhaps grieve you To hear it passionately describ'd unto you In brief they were taken, and for the great loss The enemy did sustain their victory, Being with much blood bought, they do endure The heaviest captivity, wretched men Did ever suffer, O my sons? my sons? To me for ever lost, lost, lost for ever. Sever. Will not these heaps of Gold added to thine, Suffice for ransome? Alpho. For my sons it would, But they refuse their liberty, if all That were engaged with them, have not their Irons With theirs struck off, and set at liberty with them, Which these heaps cannot purchase. Sever. Ha? the toughness Of my heart melts? be comforted old Father I have some hidden treasure, and if all, I and my Squires, these three years have laid up, Can make the sum up, freely take it. Duraz. I'll sell my self to my shirt, lands, moveables, and thou Shalt part with thine too Nephew, rather then Such brave men shall live slaves. 2. Bandit. We will not yeeld to't: 3. Bandit. Nor loose our parts. Sever. How's this? 2. Bandit. You are fitter far To be a Churchman, then to have command over good-fellows. Sever. Thus I ever use [Strikes 'em down.] Such saucy Rascals, second me Claudio. Rebellious? do you grumble? I'll not leave One rogue of 'em alive. Alpho. Hold, give the sign [He discovers himself.] All. The King. Sever. Then I am lost. Claud. The Woods are full of armed men. Alpho. No hope of your escape Can flatter you. Sever. Mercy dread Sir. Alpho. Thy carriage in this unlawful course appears so noble, Especially in this last tryal, which I put upon you, that I wish the mercy You kneel in vain for, might fall gently on you. But when the holy Oyl was pour'd upon My head, and I anointed King, I swore Never to pardon murther, I could wink at Your robberies, though our Laws call 'em death; But to dispense with Monteclaro's blood Would ill become a King, in him I lost A worthy subject, and must take from you A strict accompt of't; 'tis in vain to move, My doom's irrevocable. Monte. Not dread Sir, if Monteclaro live. Alpho. If? good Laval. Monte. He lives in him Sir, that you thought Laval. Three years have not so altered me, but you may Remember Monteclaro. Dur. How. Jol. My Brother. Calist. Uncle. Monte. Give me leave, I was Left dead in the field, but by the Duke Montpensier, Now General at Millain, taken up, And with much care recovered. Alpho. Why liv'd you so long conceal'd? Monte. Confounded with the wrong I did my Brother, in provoking him To fight. I spent the time in France that I Was absent from the Court, making my exile The punishment impos'd upon my self For my offence. Jol. Now Sir, I dare confess all This was the ghest invited to the Banquet, That drew on your suspition. Sever. Your intent, Though it was ill in you, I do forgive, The rest I'll hear at leisure; Sir, your sentence. Alpho. It is a general pardon unto all Upon my hopes, in your fair lives hereafter You will deserve it. Sever., Claud., &amp;c. Long live great Alphonso. Dur. Your mercy shewn in this, now if you please Decide these lovers difference. Alpho. That is easie. I'll put it to the womens choice, the men Consenting to it. Calist. Here I fix them, never to be remov'd. Cald. 'Tis my nil ultra Sir. Mirt. O that I had the happiness to say So much to you, I dare maintain my love Is equal to my Ladies. Ador. But my minde A pitch above yours. Marry with a servant Of no descent or fortune. Sever. You are deceiv'd, How ere she has been train'd up as a servant, She is the daughter of a noble Captain, Who in his voyage to the Persian Gulph, Perish'd by shipwrack, one I dearly lov'd. He to my care intrusted her, having taken My word, if he return'd not like himself, I never should discover what she was, But it being for her good, I will dispense with it. So much Sir for her blood, now for her portion. So dear I hold the memory of my friend, It shall rank with my daughters. Ador. This made good I will not be perverse. Duraz. With a kiss confirm it. Ador. I sign all concord here, but must to you Sir For reparation of my wounded honor, The justice of the King consenting to it, Denounce a lawful war. Alpho. This in our presence. Ador. The cause dread Sir commands it, though your Edicts Call private Combats, Murthers, rather then Sit down with a disgrace, arising from A blow; the Bonds of my obedience shook of, I'll right my self. Cald. I do confess the wrong, Forgetting the occasion, and desire Remission from you, and upon such terms As by his sacred Majesty shall be judged Equal on both parts. Ador. I desire no more. Alpho. All then are pleas'd, it is the glory of A King to make, and keep his subjects happy; For us we do approve the Roman Maxim, To save one Citizen is a greater prize, Then to have kill'd in War ten Enemies. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. SONG. Between Juno and Hymen. Juno to the Bride. Enter a Maid, but made a Bride: Be bold, and freely taste. The Marriage Banquet ne'er deny'd To such as sit down chaste. Though he unloose thy Virgin Zone, Presum'd against thy will: Those Joys reserv'd to him alone, Thou art a Virgin still. Hymen to the Bridegroom. Hail Bridegroom, hail, thy choice thus made. As thou wouldst have her true Thou must give o'r thy wanton trade, And bid loose fires adieu. That Husband who would have his Wife To him continue chaste, In her embraces spends his life, And makes abroad no waste. Hymen and Juno. Sport then like Turtles, and bring forth Such pledges as may be Assurance of the Fathers worth, And Mothers purity. Juno doth bless the Nuptial Bed, Thus Hymens Torches burn. Live long, and may, when both are dead, Your Ashes fill one Urn. II. SONG. Entertainment of the Forests Queen. Welcome, thrice welcome to this shady Green, Our long wish'd Cinthia, the Forests Queen, The Trees begin to bud, the glad Birds sing, In Winter chang'd by her into the Spring. We know no night, Perpetual light Dawns from your eye. You being near, We cannot fear, Though death stood by. From you our Swords take edge our Hearts grow bold. From you in Fee, their lives your Liegemen hold. These Groves your Kingdom, and our Law your will; Smile, and we spare; but if you frown, we kill. Bless then the hour That gives the power In which you may, At Bed and Board Embrace your Lord Both night and day. Welcome, thrice welcome to this shady Green. Our long wish'd Cinthia, the Forests Queen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. I am left to enquire, then to relate To the still doubtful Author, at what rate His marchandise are valued. If they prove Staple Commodities in your Grace and love, To this last birth of his Minerva, he Vows, and we do believe him seriously, Sloth cast of, and all pleasures else declin'd, He'll search with his best care, until he finde New ways, and make good in some labor'd Song, Though he grow old, Apollo still is yong. Cherish his good intentions, and declare By any sign of favor, that you are Well pleas'd, and with a general consent, And he desires no more encouragement. FINIS</field>
