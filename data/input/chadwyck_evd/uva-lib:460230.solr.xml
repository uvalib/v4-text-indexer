      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. It is but Justice to the absent Author to declare, in contradiction to many idle Reports, and injurious Paragraphs, that in this Piece, as in his former, he only proposed an innocent Burlesque; never thinking Ribaldry, Profaneness, or Personal Satire, a proper Entertainment for the Public, to whose experienced Candour and Indulgence he submits the following Burletta.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. MEN. Jupiter, Mr. Reinhold. Mercury, Mr. Du Bellamy. Momus, Mr. Quick. Paris, Mr. Mattocks. The Dragon, Mr. Burton. WOMEN. Juno, Miss Catley. Pallas, Mrs. Baker. Venus, Mrs. Mattocks. Iris, Miss Valois. Erynnis, Mr. Baker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Curtain rising, discovers a Splendid Pavilion in the Clouds; Juno, Pallas, and Venus at a Card-Table playing at Tredrille; on one Side a Table, with Goblets, &amp;c. Iris, in Waiting. During a Symphony, Venus shuffles and deals. Pallas frets at her bad Cards. AIR. TRIO. Francesco. Pallas, Juno, Venus. Pallas. I passâI've done so all the night. Juno. I take a King, I take a King. Ven. Pray, Ladies, stay. Pray, Ladies, stay.âI'll play alone. Juno., Pal. Again?âBless meâagain!/Again Ven., Pal. Di'monds are Trumps./Bless me!âagain? Juno. (to Venus) You scarcely Pass one hand in ten. Pal. (peevishly) The Cards owe me a spite. (to Venus) This Lady knows you;âso do I. You dealt the Cardsâand we could spy. Ven. (throws down her game) The Vol is won. The Vol is wonâwith Matadors. Pal. Spadille at bottomâO fie! Ven. With Matadors. Juno. (to Pallas) Such hints are shocking, MÃ¢m. Pal. Cheats are provoking, MÃ¢m. Ven., Pal. Lord, such a rout!/Cheats are provoking, MÃ¢m. Ven. Lord, such a rout! Juno. (to Pallas) Quite shockingâO fie! Pal. Cheats are provokingâO fie! Ven., Pal. But losers must have leave to pout./Cheats are provoking, MÃ¢m. Ven. But losers must ha' leave to pout. Juno. (to Pallas) Such terms are shocking, MÃ¢m. Ven., Pal., Juno. But losers, &amp;c./Cheats are, &amp;c. O fie!/Such terms, &amp;c. O fie! (Juno and Pallas rise in heat, and come forward. Venus sits still, counting and pocketing her gains.) RECITATIVE. Pal. (mistily) Hang cards! Juno. You're out o'luck! Pal. As I'm a sinner! I haven'tâsince last Christmasâris'n a winner. Juno. That's hard!âSo bad a run may well chagrin one: Venus is quite a dab. Pal. Dab!âShe'sâa keen one; At all gamesâplays th'whole game. Juno. Aye, aye! Pal. Match none has; For sleight of hand,âwill slip an aceâwith Jonas. Juno. Gambles deep too! Pal. Well mayâwho never loses: At Putt, poor girls!âsh' as beggar'd the Nine Muses; Fine as a Queen o'ginger-breadâparades it; But ne'er has paid the wages of her Maids yet. Juno. (laughing) Like enoughâfor the Graces,âand 'tis scandalous, Go mother-naked. Pal. (with spleen) Skin-flint!âso to randle us! 'Twould vex a saint.â AIR II. Dooralin. A thriving trade The nimming jade Has pick'd up, here, of chousing us; With sly slim flams, And palming shams, At Brothel learnt, or Bouzing-house! [Turning to Ven. insolently.] You must purloin, In duds to shine So dizen'dâthere's no hoa wi' you; But the next coin You nab of mine, By Pam! I'll pluck a crow wi' you. RECITATIVE. Juno. (in disapprobation) NayâPallas! [Venus advances to them, smiling jocosely at Pallas.] Ven. (in banter) Miss,âyou'reâfunny, Poor dear!âhas't lost it' temper with it' money? ha! ha! ha! Pal. (exasperated) Pert chitty face! 'cause leud fops call youâpretty; You fancy thoseâpatch-clenchesâsmartâand witty. Ven. (gibing) Prettyâthe fools!âdo they, indeed?âAh, tell us. Pal. (contemptuously) Conceited moppet! Ven. (waggishly) Sure, Miss,âyou a'n't jealous. [Takes out a pocket-glass, and views herself affectedly.] AIR III. Laschi and Galluppi. Ven. If I have someâlittleâbeautyâ Can I help it?âNo, not I;â Some good luck tooâ'tis my duty Gifts so precious to apply. NatureâFortuneâgave 'em freely; And I'll use 'emâquite genteelly. If the Smarts of the Sky Cringe, ogle, and sigh, Whene'er I pass by; And cry, Looky there! What an air! Gods, how fair! Pray, why (To feed your starch'd pride) Must I go and hide, 'Till you're made a bride? Who, I? No, noâIf I do, may I die. RECITATIVE. Pal. (incensed) Don't rouze me, Bold-face!âif your tongue's so flippant, I'll take y'a chuckâas shall chop off the tip on't. [Pallas advances upon her; she takes shelter behind Juno.] Ven. (in fear, screaming) I'll swear the peace:âkeep at arms-length, Virago! (To Juno, whimpering) She'll brain me, MÃ¢m! Pal. (in spiteful rage) âWell, had I don't long a-go. Ven. (still whimpering) Your tongue's no slanderâfor that, not a button Care I;âbut I can't stand your fist o'mutton. Juno. (Aside, chuckling) Nuts to me, ThisâI hope, 'twill be a scuffle; (to them) My stars! what was't cou'd thus your tempers ruffle? Pal. Her gibes, Ven. Her rants. Pal. Don't snouch then! Ven. Don't you hector! Juno. (taking each by the hand) Faults on both sidesâsit downâcome, I'll direct here. And Iris!âstir, wench!âfill about the nectar. Pal. Venusâyour quips would Patient Grisel canker, Howe'er, shake hands! Ven. (giving her hand) Here, Miss, I bear no rancour. AIR IV. Touch the Thing, you Bastard. (All sit, and Iris serves them with Nectar. Juno (sings). When bickrings hot, To high words got, Break out at Gamiorum; The flame to cool, My Golden Rule IsâPush about the Forum. With fist on jug, Coiss who can lug? Or shew me that glib speaker, Who her red rag In gibe can wag, With her mouth full of liquor. (They all drink.) (Exeunt, merrily singing in Chorus) The Golden Rule IsâPush about the Forum. [Scene closes. SCENE changes to a Wood. Enter Momus, in the habit of the Antique Court Jester. Walks to and fro impatiently. RECITATIVE accompanied. Mom. By Jingo! if Erynnisâfrom the Hesperides, Steals me the Dragon's Appleâwe'll ha'merry days. Augh!âho!âoa!â(yawning and stretching) Court's grown damn'd hum-drum:âJove, poor Noodle! Does nought but muddle.â Juno tooâturn'd soâmim, forsooth, Butter will scarce melt in her mouth. But th'AppleâyesâI'll throwâthat squib among 'emâ Shall stir the humoursâas a wasp had stung 'em. AIR V. Behind the Bush in the Garden. Mom. To set at odds These hair-brain'd Gods, The turn of a straw or a pin does; I make them fret, Take pet, Curvet, And fling Heaven out o'the windows. He, she, foul, handsome, all, On wires I dance 'em all, Jove of my puppets but is chief; Sky, earth, and ocean, I put in commotion; I doat on a snug bit o'mischief. [To him enter running, as from pursuit, Erynnis, holding the Golden Apple in her hand, and habited as an old witch.] RECITATIVE. Ery. Here, Momus, 'tisâat last;âI'm all o'er dripping. Mo. Good Hag!âNow quick, to Juno's palace tripping, Amongst the three Sultanas drop this Pippin. Ery. That Dragon! Oh! we've had a-do most hellish, Burn him!âfor Pippins he has spoil'd my relish. Mo. No fear;âI'll fool him with some rigma-rol,â Pat on his back, and scratch his pol.â Ery. But Iâ(in terror) Mo. Youâmust plump down to Hell,âto Pluto; I've writ a card to him.â Ery. (trembling) Any where,âin tuto. [The Dragon is heard roaring.] Mo. Off! off! [She takes to her heels, Momus skulks aside.âEnter impetuously the Dragon, searching on every side, during the symphony, to find herâthen]â AIR VI. Francesco. Dra. Stop thief! Stop thief! My Pippin!âBoh!âthe varlet!â Hoh!âI'm out of breath!â Boh!âCould I clutch that harlot, Who wrought my grief, I'd be her death; Stop thief! Stop thief! Stop thief! [Momus comes forth, and accosts him familiarly. Mo. Ha,âmy old friend!âhow is't? Dra. Saw you that Beldam Erynnis scamper by? Mo. Faith, Sir,âsheâseldom Visits these parts;âyet pass'dâwithin this half-hour, Hobblingâto Juno,âwith some fruitâyouâgave her. Dra. She lies,âshe stole it:âGave! give her a halter! Her due.âThe thief!â Mo. Stole! ay, an old defaulter.â Sue out a warrantâ Dra. Sue!âthe Queen has got it,â I may go whistleâPiqued,âRepiqued,âCapotted!â Mo. Pluck up,âtalk big to her,â (Aside) I'll egg on this hot-head. AIR VII. DUO. Francesco. Fluster, Bluster, Strut, Sir.â Dra. But, Sir, She'll picker and rail. Mo. Why then roar, and whisk your tail. Dra. Oh, Sir, No, Sir, Fair wordsâ Mo. Bare words Never will prevail. Dra. But I may be sent to Jail. Mo. Mouthy, mealy! Can't I bail ye? Does your courage fail ye? Dra. No; but, Sir, 'Twill make a stir, And Jove may demur. And Jove may demur. Mo. On my word, he won't demur. Dra. Since you say So, I may Skur away. Mo. Skur. And be sure you put it home t'her: Servant, Sir. Dra. I shall pelt on, 'till I come t'her, Whip and spur. Mo. And be sure, &amp;c. Servant, Sir. Dra. I shall pelt, &amp;c. Thank you, Sir. [Exeunt severally, bowing. SCENE shifts to Juno's Pavilion. A knocking; then Juno's bell rings vehemently. Enter Iris running. Juno, Pallas, and Venus, enter on the other side. RECITATIVE. Juno. High time, Miss Lazyboots! where ha' you been lolloping? Iris. Sure, MÃªmâat the first tinkleâI came galloping. Juno. Who rapp'd? Iris. Beau Cupid, MÃªm, ask'd for Miss Pallas. (Exit.) Pal. For me? the Whelp!âI'd see him to the Gallows. Ven. Gallows! MÃ¢m. (rising provok'd) Pal. Ayâ'twill be his prank conclusive, As he goes on. Ven. (to Juno) MÃ¢mâshe's downright abusive. AIR VIII. Giordani. Ven. (to Pallas) But ah! Sweet Miss, your temper keep! Your Peace my Boy shall ne'er invade; Cupid shall not break your sleep, You shall still remain a Maid. All Ever-green Be Pallas seen! Laurels her learned brows adorn! Baleful yew, Cypress too! Roses alone ne'er deck that thorn. RECITATIVE. Pal. I'd mince the blinkardâto a salmagondi. [Enter Iris in a fright to Juno, the Apple in her hand.] Iris. Oh! MÃªm! Juno. Are you bewitch'd, Girl?âWhat has stunn'd ye? Hast seen a Ghostâ Iris. Worse, MÃªmâthat hagâErynnis. Juno. Got in, d'ye say?âI wou'dn't for five guineasâ Iris. In troth, I think, that Witch the Devil-in-is. AIR IX. Sweet, if you love me, &amp;c. 1. Told by the Porter and the Page, Not at homeâ You'd ha' thought she'd burst with rage. 'Skips, I must see the Queen, and willâ Dear Ma'm, says Iâthe Queen is ill, Takes James's Powder, and Ward's Pill. Not at home, Eccho'd they to all her askings. 2.
