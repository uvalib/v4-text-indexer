      <field name="fulltext">Her Begynnes His Resurrection on Pas[c]he Daye at Morn</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pascha Mawdleyne begynnes, sayinge: [MAWDLEYNE]. O, this grete hevynese and payn! Alese, how longe shalle it remayn? How longe shalle it endure, And rist within my most carfulle hart? How longe shalle I feyle this dedly smarte? Who shalle my sorowe cure? How longe shalle I lef in desolation? When shalle Ã¾e houre com of consolation, That my master I maye see, Which opon the Friday laste, Was crucified and nailit fast, Peteosly tille a tree? So pyteose a sight and lamentabille, So dolorose and miserabille, I hop ye shalle neuer fynd! Cursid Kayn was verrey cruelle, And slew his awn brothere Abelle, Of a maliciose mynd; Yit was he not so maliciose Ose the cruelle Jewes most owtragiose Which here has slayn my Lord! The sonnes of Jacob gret envy had Agayns Ã¾er brother Joseph, ?onge, wise, and sad, Os scriptur doth record. Thay intendit to slo hym malishosly, And yit Ã¾ay did not soo cruelly, Os wrought thes Jewes wild! Few ?eres past, Herod the kinge Put to deth many ?onglinge, And many moders child, Here in the land off Israelle; But of such cruelte harde ye neuer telle Ose done was one Fridaye, When so grete rigore and tyrannye Was in theire hartes to garre hym dye, Which was so graciose aye. Abelle and Josephe wer gude and graciose, But theire dedes wer not so gloriose, Nor of so vertuose kynd, Ose of hym which in his humanitee Wrought grete myracles in his diuinitee, Als ye may calle to mynd. For alle his werkes so welle devyside, Emange tham thus to be dispised, And with cruellty slayn! Ales, when I remembere his woo, Scantly may I spek or goo, In harte I haue such payn. I haue bought here oyntmentes preciouse To ensalue his body most graciose, To doo it reuerence. My sister Cleophe saide that shee To the sepulcre wald goo with mee, And doo hir diligence. Of the thrid day this is Ã¾e mornynge, And of my dere master yit herd I nothinge, Wherfor I am moste hevee. Alese, felishipe her is noon! Rathere then I faile, I wille go alone. A, dere Lorde, your mercee! Secund Marye commys in and sais: [SECUND MARYE]. A, my harte, what Ã¾ou art faynt! How longe shalle we thus mak complaynt? So sorowfulle tym neuer was! When shalle comforth com of our desire? What woman is this Ã¾at lyes here? It is Mawdleyn, alese! Sister Mawdleyn, why waile ye on this wise? Gud sister, we pray ?ou, stand vp, arise! Comforth yourself wyslye! MAWDLEYN. Off your commynge, sister, I am glade. Iwise, I knaw welle Ã¾at ?e be sadd; Ye haue cawse os welle os I! SECUND MARYE. Ther is no gud creatur, dar I saye, But inwardly sorowe he may, And compleyn bitterlye, To remembere the felle torment, And cruelle payne of this innocent, Which levit so vertuoslye. Of his meknese hymself he offred, Whatsoeuer payn to hym was profred, This lambe, God[es] Sonn so free; Nothinge ragid he, ne was vnpaciente, But euer most mekly tille his payn he went, With bayne benignitee. From the tym of Abrahame, And Ã¾at our faders from Egip cam, Or when sorow was maste, I am suere was neuer day so piteouse, So doolfulle and so dangerouse, Ose Friday that is paste, When alle the crueltye was owt sought, To distroy hym made alle thing of noght, To sloo hym that gyves life? Owt of my mynd this neuer goo shalle, That for man diete the maker of alle, By his manhed passyve. MAWDLEYN. So doolfulle a day was neuer befor this! But go we to the monyment where his sepulcre is, To anoynte his body there. SECUND MARYE. Sister, I com for that sam intent; Ther is nothinge can me better content; To go, I haue no fere. MAWDLEYN. Then, gude sister, lat vs goo devowtlee. SECUNDE MARYE. Abide! Yonder commes Marye Jacobee! I trow with vs sho wille goo. Thride Marye commys in. [THRIDE MARYE]. O, gude sisters, how is it with ?owe? MAWDLEYN. A, dere sister, neuer soo eville os nowe! THRID MARYE. Gud Mawdleyn, say not soo! This is the third day, ?e remember welle. MAWDLEYN. Ye, bot of my master and Lorde I her not telle, Therfore I can not cease. We were goynge to [the] monyment Wheros lyeth that swete innocent. Loo, here, oyntmentes of swetnese! THRID MARYE. Gude sisters, on yow shalle I wayte. SECUNDE MARYE. Then let vs tak Ã¾e way furth strayte. MAWDLEYN. Sisters, I perceyve the place is her bye. Lat vs ordeyn our oyntmentes accordinglye, With alle humylite. Here lyes he Ã¾at was mercifulle to synners alle; Here lyese he most piteose when we did calle; Com nerr, sisters, and see! Lo, here is the place wher Ã¾e body was laid, Which born was of a virgyn and a cleyn maid. Tille honour it, grete cawse haue wee. Gud sisters, be we not affrayd To do hym reuerence and dewtee. Here he lyeth whose lif surmountes alle oÃ¾er, Which raysed from deth to lyve Lazarus my broÃ¾er, Now a levinge man. He lyese here, which by his powre devyn, In Chana Galilee turnyde water to wyn, Ose many testyfy can. The angelle spekes: [ANGELLE]. Whom seke ye, women sanctifiede? Three Maryes togider sais: [THREE MARYES]. Jhesus of Nazareth crucified, The redemer of mankind. ANGELLE. He is resyne! He is not here! To his disciples he shalle apereâ In Galilee thay shalle hym fynd! Mulier, quid ploras? Woman, why wepis Ã¾ou soo? MAWDLEN. For myn harte is fulle of sorow and woo. My Lorde, Ã¾at was the kinge of blisse, Is takyn away; I wat not wher he is. ANGELLE. Com hidder, women, approche mor nere! Be of gude comfurth and of gud cher, For so gret cawse ye haue! He that ye seke so beselye, With gude mynd so faythfullye, Is resyn here from his grave! The Son of Gode in his humanite Sufferde deth, and by his diuinitee Is resyn the thrid daye. For redemption of man was he born, Displayede on the crose, and alle to-torn, In right piteose araye. The batelle is done and victorye renuyd! The grete enmy of man Ã¾erby is subduyd, That most hatid mankynd. Com hidder, and behold with your eye The place where Ã¾e body did lye. Be joyeos now of mynd! Loo, here is the cloth droppid blud, Which was put on hym takyn of Ã¾e rud, Ose yourself did see. For a remembrance tak it yee, And hy yow fast to Galileeâ For ther apper shalle hee! MAWDLEYN. Yit must myn herte wepe inwerdlye! Yit must I mowrn contynuallye, Myndinge my master dere. O, what myn harte is hevy and lothe When I beholde this piteose clothe, Which in my hande is here! This cloth with blude Ã¾at is so stayned, Of a maydens child so sor constraynid, On cross when he was done! O rygore vnright! O crueltee! O wikkit wylfullnese! O peruersitee! O hartes harde os stone, To put to deth a lamb so meke! Welle may the teres ron down your cheke! Welle may your hertes relent, Myndinge the payn my Lord and master felte! O, in my body my herte now dothe melte! To dy I were content. SECUND MARYE. Sister Mawdlen, to blame ye are, With this dedly sorow yourself to marre, Yourself thus to torment! Ye torment your selfe and crucifye! Ye haue cawse to tak gladnes, and whye, Ye haue proue evident That your master and oures, by his Godly myght, Is resen from deth to lyfe! An angelle bright Schewes thes tidinges tille vs, And shewed vs the place wher his body laye, Which is not ther! ForÃ¾i, let passe a waye Our sorow most grevouse! THRIDE MARYE. Sister Mawdlyen, in your hart be stabille. We shalle here tidinges right comfortabille, And Ã¾at, I trust, shortlye, For that is suth veritabille, Saide so afore suthlye. MAWDLEYN. A! A, sisters! My slewth and my necligence! I haue not don my dewty ne my diligence, Ose vnto me did falle! At my masters sepulcre if I hade gifen attendance, And waytid wisely with humble affiance, Os I was bound most of alle, I shuld haue seyn his vprisinge gloriose Of my swete Lorde, of Ã¾e which desirose I am, and nedes must bee. Alese, sisters! I was to tidiose, That holy sight to see! Than I shuld haue had comforth vncomparabille, Of the which joye to speke I am not abille! Than I hade seyn my Lorde To haue resyn from his sepulture With his bludy woundes; of hym I had ben sure! Ales, when I record How I myghte haue had a sight of your presence, Who then aught of verrey congruence To be mor glad than I, Which ye haue callid by your grace onlee, Beynge gretist synner, vnto your large mercee, And that most curtesly? Whoso wille not wayte when Ã¾at tym is, When faynest he wold, therof shalle he mysseâ So it faris by mee. O, wold to God I had made more haste! My slewthfulle werke is now in wast! ?it, gud Lord, haue Ã¾ou pitee! When Symon to dyner did hym calle, Amonges the gestes and straungers alle, With meknese soberlye, I com in with mynde contrite, For I hade levid in fowlle delite, In syn of licherye. Notwithstandinge the gret abhomynation Of my grete synnes fulle of execration, Yit of his benignite, As with alle mercy he was replete, He sufferte me with teris to wesh his fete! Loo, his mercyfulle pitee! My synfulle lippes, which I did abuse, To towch his blessit fleshe he wald not refuse. And ther right oppenlye, Off his most piteouse tendernese, The pardoun of my synnes and gret excesse He gaue to me hoolye! Now may I wringe, both wepe and wayle, Myndinge on Friday his gret bataile He had on crosse of tree, And tuk opon hym for vs alle To ouercom the fend Ã¾at made vs falle! A, sisters, welle mowrn may wee! SECUND MARYE. Sister Mawdleyn, it is bot in vayn Thus remedilesse to mak compleyn. Therfor it is the best, Ych on of vs a diuerse way to take; His apperinge joyfulle may vs make, And set ouir hartes in reste. THE THRIDE MARYE. Ye, to sek and inquere, let vs faste hye, Sister Mawdlen! This is next remedye, And Ã¾erfore departe wee! MAWDLEYN. O Lorde and master, help vs in hye To haue a sight of thee! Tunc exeunt hee tres Marie. Petrus intrat, flens amare. [PETER]. O, allmyghty God, which with thyn inward ee Seest the depest place of mannys conscience, And knowest euery thinge most cler and perfitlee, Haue mercy, haue pitee, haue Ã¾ou compatience! I confess and knowlege my most gret offence, My fowle presumption and vnstabilnesse. Let Ã¾i mekille mercy ouerflowe my synfulnesse! And yit I knaw welle, No erthly thinge can telle, Nor ?it it expresse, My fawtes and gret syn, Which I am wrappid in With dedly hevinesse! Ther may not be lightly a greter trispesse Then the seruaunt the master to denye! His owne master! His own kind master, alesse! I mak confession here most sorowfullye That I denyed mayster, and Ã¾at most unkindlye! For when thay did enquere if Ã¾at I did hym knoo, I saide I neuer sawe hym! Alesse! Why did I soo? With teres of contrition, With teres of compassion, Welle may I mowrnynge make! What a fawte it was, The seruaunte, alas, His master to forsake! When his grace callid me fro warldly besines, And of a poore fishere his disciple chas mee, I was callit Symon Bariona, playnly to expresse. But he namid me âPetrusââPetra was hee! Petra is a ston, fulle of stabilitee, Alway stedfaste! Alase! Wherfor was I Not stabille accordinge to my nam, stedfastlye? O, my febille promesse! O, my gret vnkindnesse, To my shame resaruyd! O, mynde so vnstabille! Thou hast made me culpabille! Deth I haue deseruyd! It plesid thy gudnese gret kindnese to shew mee, Callinge me to Ã¾i grace and gudly conuersation; And when it pleasid thi Godhed to tak but three To beholde and see the highe speculation Of thy Godly maiestye in thy transfyguration, Thy specialle grace did abille me for on, With the gud blessid James, and Ã¾i cosyn John. Alese, Ã¾at I was so vnkind To hym, so tender of mynd To me, most vnworthye! Ales, the paynes ar smarte, Which I fele at my harte, And that so bitterlye! O Lorde, what example of meknesse shewed yee! On Thursday after supere, it pleasid your grace To wesh your seruauntes fete. Who euer are did see More perfite meknese shewet in any case? I myself was present in the same place. Alese! Of myself why presumyd I, Consideringe your meknese, don so stedfastlye? A, myn vnkinde chaunce! When it commys to remembrance, In my mynde it is euer! I fele owt of mesure Dedly payn and displesure, That I can not desseuere. O mercyfulle redemer, who may yit recownte The paynes which Ã¾iself for vs did endure? Vnworthy if I were, I was with Ã¾e in Ã¾e mount, Where Ã¾ou swet bludy droppes man saule to recure. In that gret agonye, I am right verrey sure, Stony hartes of flint, Ã¾ou wald Ã¾am haue mevid, Seynge thy tendernese to man, by Ã¾e relevid! O, that passion was grete, When blud[y] droppes of swet Ran down apace! That was excedinge payne In euery membere and vayn, As apperit by his face. Of Judas thow were betrayede by and bye, Which was thy discipulle, and familiere with the; It grevid the more, I knew it certanlye, He was fede at Ã¾i burde of Ã¾i benignitee, And ?it [thow] were betrayed by his iniquitee! Yf a straunger had don Ã¾at dede so trayterouse, It had beyn mor tolerabille and not so greuowse. Dauid did say in prophecye, âHomo pacis mee, in quo speraui, Supplantauit meâ. O Lord, your pacience may be perceyvid, Which suffert so to be betrayed Of Judas! Woo is hee! Fulle of wo may I bee, sorowfulle and pensyve, Complenynge and wepinge with sorow inwertlee, And wep bitter teres alle Ã¾e days of my life! My vnstabille delinge is euer in myn ee. I saide I wald not leve my master for to dee; He said I shuld forsak hym or Ã¾e cok crow thris. But I was presumptuose, vnware, and vnwise! Afterwerd, when hee Lokid opon mee With a myld cowntenaunce, Ose he stude on the ground, Emange his enmyse bownd, O, I wepit abundaunce! Then my teres continuelly Ran down most sorowfully, And yit thay can not cesse; How may I cesse or stynte? Yf my harte wer of flinte, I haue caus to wepe, dowtlese! O caytife! O wofulle wreche! From thy harte Ã¾ou may feche Sore and sighes depe! O, most vnkind man! What creatur may or can The from sclaunder kepe? To forsake Ã¾i master so tender and soo gud, Which gaue to Ã¾e Ã¾e keyes of alle holy kirke, And morouer for thy sake shed his own blud! O synfulle caytyfe! Now aught I sore tille irke! Ales, John! Why did not I Folow my master so tenderlye Os ?e did, to the ende? But for ye delt soo stedfastlye, My master gaue you Marye To kep in your commend. Yf this dedly woo and sorowe Endure with me vnto tomorowe, Myn hart in sunder wille breke! Now, Lorde, for Ã¾i tender mercyes alle, Reconcyle me to grace, and to Ã¾i mercy calle! Ales, I may not speke! Et sic cadit in terram, flens amare. [Andreas et Iohannes intrant.] Andreas, frater Petri, dicit. [ANDREAS]. A brothere Peter, what nedes alle Ã¾is? I se welle, good cowncelle wille yow mysse. Dry vp your teres and rise! Comforth yourselfe, I require yow, and praye! We shalle haue gud tidinges! This is Ã¾e thrid day! Sorow not in this wise! JOHANNES EUANGELISTA. Stand vp, gud brothere, and mesur your hevynese! This gret contrition of your hart, dowtlese, To God is plesant sacrifice. PETRUS. A, gud brethere Andrewe and John, Was neuer creatur so wobegon Os I, wrech most vnwyse! For, rememberinge the infinite gudnese Of my Lorde, and my most vnkyndnese Don so writchitlye, At my hart sorow sittes so sore That my dedly payn encresis mor and more! Alese, my gret folye! ANDREAS. Gud brothere Peter, yourself ?e comfort! Ther is none of alle bot comfurth may he hafe, For emonges vs agayn our Lorde shalle resorte! By his passion his purpasse was mankind to saue. This is the thrid daye, in which from his graue He shalle arise fro deth, I haue no dowte. Therfor, lett comfurth put this sorowe owt! Brothere Peter, Ã¾e verrey truth to saye, Few of vs alle hade perfit stedfastnesse, But sumwhat dowtid, and wer owt of the waye, Notwithstandinge of his Godhed the clernesse, Schewed by his miracles, with alle perfitnese. And yf ye remember, brothere, in his last oblation He spak of our vnstabilnesse, and of his desolation, Saynge âOmnes vos scandalum patieminiââ âAlle ye shalle suffer sclaunder for meââ Os who say, âYe shalle forsak me alonly; The hird-man shal be strikyn, and Ã¾e flokkââwhich we beeâ âSchal be disperbilit, and away shalle fleeâ. Loo, gud brother Peter, he knew our frealtes alle; Our gude master is mercifulle and graciose withalle. And yow, brother Peter, the most specialli Hase cause of comfurth, for of his church Ã¾e hed He chace you by order, by his grace frelye; ForÃ¾i, from your harte put Ã¾is fere and dred! Yf ye remember, he said to yow indede, âThy faith shalle neuer faile, whatsoeuer befalleâ. Therfor, haue gud hope, and comforth spiritualle! Ye askit hym ons a whestion, wherwith he was content, How oft to your brother synn ye shuld relese. Ye thought seuen tymmes were verrey sufficient, But he said sevynty tymes and seuen ye suld forgif, dow[t]les. A gret now[m]ber, it plesit hym tille expresse The gret frelty of man he saw in his Godly myndâ Forthy for your trispace pardon may ye find. Howbeit, of yourself to presume, to blame ye were; Man, Ã¾at is freale, of hymself suld haue fere. Your pennance [and] contrition acceptabille must bee; Therfor, in your harte rejoye ye may be fayn, Rememberinge he has put [yow] in gret auctoritee. That he has saide ons, he wille neuer calle agayn; âQuodcumque ligauerisâ, he saidâÃ¾es wordes ar playnâ And gaue yow Ã¾e keyes of hevyn and of helle, So to lowse and to byndâthis can we alle telle! JOHANNES EUANGELISTA. Gude brother Peter, marke ye welle, and note; The wordes of Andrewe beyn sadd and ponderose. In your conscience I knaw welle is no?t so great mot, But that mercy may clere it, of hym that is so graciose. Perauenter it was Ã¾e wille of our master Jhesus That ?e shuld not be present his passion to see, Which he hade on the hille in Ã¾e most crueltee. Peter, if ye had seyn your mastere at Ã¾at poynt, I trov Ã¾at sy?t had beyn to hevy to yow tille endure. He had torment opon torment in euery vayn and joynt, He was so harde nailet to Ã¾at paynfulle lure; His flesh Ã¾at was so tender, born of a mayden pure, And was wont to be towchid with virgyns handes swet, Was al totorn most piteosly from hede to Ã¾e fet, When his body was halid and stritchid with ropes, To caws his armes and fet to Ã¾e holes extend, Then Ã¾e nayles dreffyn in, and of Ã¾e blude dropes Ran owt so plentuosly; his wille it was to spend Alle his precios blude, mannes sor tille amend. Withowt compleint he suffert the nayles and Ã¾e spere; But gretist payn Ã¾at he had was for his moder dere. He sufferd patiently To be betrayed vnkindly, To be accusid falsly, To be intraytid cruelly, To be scornyd most dedenynglye, To be juged wrangfully, To be dampnyt to deth dolfully, With other paynes sere; To be crucified piteosly, To be woundid vniuersally, With scowrges, nayles, and spere. For thes causes he wald be born of a maid most obedient. Now the gret rawnson is paied which was a requirid For redemption of man of the Fader omnipotent. The tyme of desolation is now expirid; The tym of grace is commen, so longe of vs desirid! Hevyn ?eates, so longe closid for gret syn, Our Saueyour gafe yow the keyes to open and to lat in. He knew welle, for his deth we shuld be afrayed, And Ã¾erfor ose ?e remembere, he told vs afore. His Godhed saw welle Ã¾at we shuld be dismaid; Of his resurrection he comfortid vs therfore, He saide he shuld arise, and live eueremore! This is the thride daye: therfor, dowt nothinge, But shortly we shalle here of his gloriose vprisinge! Brether, I wolde tarrye with yow longer here, But nedes I must go to the virgyn mylde. Most sorowfulle is hir hart, most hevy is hir chere; Alle joye and comfurthe from hir is exilde; Alle hir rememberance is of hir dere childe. My master assignyt me to gyve hir attendance, And that is my dewtye, with alle humblye obseruance. Hir sorow increacyse aye, As welle nyght os daye, In most piteose araye; For I dar say suerlye, Sen hir son was betrayed, And in his grave layde, The maid hase me dismaid, For sorow inwerdlye, That sho nowther tuk rist ne slepe, Ne from hevynese hirself cowth kepe, But euermore stille dose sho wepe, That I am verrey sure Hartes harder then stone Wold be mollyfyed anone, And melte to see hire mone, That sho dose endure. To here hir mourn so moderlye, To se hir wep so tenderlye, Alle myn hert, it fayles; Now sho spekes of the scornes, Now sho remembers Ã¾e thornes, And the grete sturdy nayles! Now sho spekes of his pacience, Now sho myndes his obedience, That vnto deth was. Now of his visage spekes shee, Defilid with deformyte, Of fowlle spittinge, alasse! Now of his woundes dos sho speke, And of the sper which did breke Hir sonnes blessid sid. Thus is sho alle comfurthlesse, Replet with alle dulfulnesseâ Therfor, I may not bide. As for this tym, I wille departe. Brother Peter, be of gud harte, For other cause haue ye none. Now farwelle for a starte, I shalle ?ow mete anon. PETER. Praye fore me, brother, for Goddes sake! JOHANNES EUANGELISTA. Brothere, to yow no discomfurth take, But truste euer faithfullye! We shall haue comforth, ?oure sorowe to slake, And that, I trust, shortlye. Tunc exit Iohannes et dicit Petrus: [PETER]. Brothere Andrewe, God reward ?oue euer speciallye! For John and ye, with youre swete wordes of consolation, Hase easid my mynd with comforte stedfastlye. I am in trewe faith and hope without desperation, In my saule now havynge spiritualle iubilation, Trustinge on the mercy of my master and Lord, Of whose infinite gudnese I shalle euer record. Let the dew of mercy falle opon vs: âOstende faciem tuam et salui erimus!â Schewe thy powere, gud Lord, and to vs appere! Let beames of thi grace approche to vs nere, Super nos, writchit synners! [Exeunt Petrus et Andreas] Intrat Maria Magdalena. [MAWDLEYN]. O, I, writchit creature, what shalle I doo? O, I, a wofulle woman, whidere salle I goo? My Lorde, wher shalle I find? When shalle I se that desirid face, Which was so fulle of bewty and grace, To me, the most vnkind? I haue sought and besely inquerid Hym whom my harte alleway has desired, And so desiries stille. âQuem diligit anima mea, quesiui; Quesiui illum, et non inueni!â When shalle I haue my wille? I haue sought hym desirusly, I haue sought hym affectuosly, With besines of my mynd. I haue sought hym with mynd hartely, The tresure wherin my hart dose lye. O Deth, thou arte vnkind! On me vse thou and exercise The auctorite of thyn office! My bales thou may vnbind! What offence, Deth, haue I don to the, Which art so ouer-vnkind to mee? Nay, nay, Deth, be not soo! Filie Jerusalem, wheros ye goo, Nunciate dilecto meo Quia amore langueo! Of Jerusalem, ye virgyns clere, Schew my best loue that I was here, Telle hym, os he may prove, That I am dedly seke, And alle is for his loue. Jhesus intrat, in specie ortulani, dicens: [JHESUS]. Mulier, ploras? Quem queris? Woman, why wepis thou? Whom sekes thou thus? Telle me whome thou wald haue. MAWDLEN. I sek my master and swete Lorde, Jhesus, Which her was layd in grave. JHESUS. Woman, thou mournest to piteoslye, And compleynist the most hevilye; Thy mynd is not content. Thyn hart is trowblit, welle I see, Alle fulle doloruse os thinkes mee; Thou has not thyn intente. MAUDLEYN. Myn intent, that knawes hee On whom my hart is set, and ay shal bee. Gardener, I yowe praye, Schew vnto me, if ye can, Yf that ye did see here ony man Tak his body awaye. Jhesus dicit: âMaria!â Mawdleyn awnswers: âRaboni!â JHESUS. Noli me tangere! Mary, towche me not now! But into Galilee go thowe, And to my brether saye, And to Peter, which sorowfulle is, That I am resen from dethe to lif ay in blisse, Renynge perpetuallye! Exhort tham to be of gud chere, And hastely wylle I to tham aper, To comfurth joefullye! Exit Jhesus. MAWDLEYN. O, myn harte, wher hast thou bee? Com hom agayn, and leve with mee! My gret sorow is past! Now may thou entone a mery songe, For he, whom thou desirid so longe, I haue foun now at laste! I thanke your grace with hert intere, That of yowre gudnese to me wald apere, And make my hert thus light. Secund Marye intrat cum tercia. [SECUND MARYE]. Soror, nuncia nobis! Gud Mawdleyn! Sister, how standes with yow? MAWDLEYN. Dere sisters, neuer so welle os nowe! For I haue hade a sight Of my Lorde and master, to my comfurth specialle! To his Godhed I render thankes immortalle, Os I am bound of dewtee. THRID MARYE. It apperis, suster, by your cowntenaunce, That the gret sorow is owt of remembraunce, And so, by your sawe, gret cause haue yee! MAWDLEYN. I haue gret cause, sisters, I knaw it welle! For of my joye he is the springe and welle, And of my lyfe sustenaunce. SECUNDE MARYE. Haue ye seyn our Lord, sister? Ar ye sure? MAWDLEN. Sister, I haue seyne my gretist tresure, My hartly joye and plesaunce! THRIDE MARY. A, sister, gret comfert may your hart inflame! MAWDLEN. ?e, gude sister, he callit me âMaryâ, by my name, And spak with me homlye. I saw hym bodely, in flesh and bloode, Our Redemere, which for vs hang on the roode; He shewed hyme gratioslye, And bade me go to his disciples sone, Thaime to certifye of his resurrectione, And so wille I shortly doo. SECUND MARIE. A, A, Mawdleyn, right happee ye were! Ye spente not in vayn so many bitter tere! Gret grace is lent yow too! Tunc venit Jhesus et salutat mulieres istas tres. Tamen mulieres nil dicunt ei, sed procidunt ad pedes eius. [JHESUS]. Auete! Hayle, blessit women leve! My blessinge here I youe geve! Let sorow no more youre harte meve, But haue comfort allwaye! I am resene fro deth, so may ye telle; I haue deliuert my presoners frome helle, And made tham sure for aye! [Exit Jhesus.] MAWDLEYN. Now, gud sisters, be no more sadd! Ye haue cause os welle os I to be gladd! Oure Lorde, loo, of his gudnese, Of his heghe and Godly excellence, Haves shewede vs here his joyefulle presence, With wordes of swetnese!

O, Mawdleyn, this was a gloriose sight, Schewed to vs gracioslye! SECUND MARYE. Blessid be that Lorde! Blessit be that Kinge, That haues comfurth vs thus with his vprisinge, So sone and glorioslye! MAWDLEN. Susters, in joye of this joyfullnese, A songe of comforte lete vs expresse, With notes of armonye: âVictime paschali laudes immolant Christiani!â Tunc hee tres cantant idem, id est, âVictime paschaÂ«liÂ»ââ totum vsque ad âDiÂ«c nobisÂ»â in cantifracto vel saltum in pallinodio. Tunc occurent eis apostoli, scilicet Petrus, Andreas, et JohannÂ«esÂ», cantantes hoc, scilicet: âDic nobis, Maria, quid vidisti in viÂ«aÂ»?â Respondent mulieres, cantantes: âSepulcrum Christi viueÂ«ntisÂ»â, et cetera, vsque ad âCredendum estâ. Apostoli, respondentes, cantant: âCredendum est magis soli Marie veraci quam Judeorum turbe fallaciâ. Mulieres iterum cantant: âScimÂ«usÂ» Christum surrexisse vereâ. Apostoli et mulieres sÂ«imulÂ» cantant quasi concredentes: âTu nobis Christe rex misereÂ«reÂ»â. Amen. Post cantum dicit Petrus. Sufficit si cantetur eisdem notis et cantibus vt habetur in sequentia predicta. Petrus dicit post cantum. [PETER]. How is it now, Marye, can ye telle Any newes which may lik vs welle? Blithe is youre countenaunce! MAWDLEYN. Peter, in youre mynde be fast and stabille! I can shew youe tydinges most comfortabille, Trust it of assurance! PETERE. Gude Marye, of hym I wold knawlege haue. MAWDLEYN. Peter, oure master is resyn from his grave! He apperit vnto vs three In fleshe and bone in a gloriose wise!

Brothere John, I am fully certifyed To gife credens hertoo. Now shalle the suth be verefied Of hym that most may doo! O, myche ar we bound, gud Lord, to your highnes! For vs wer ye born, and also circumcised; For vs were ye tempid in the wildernese; Now crucyfied to deth, most shamfully dispised!
