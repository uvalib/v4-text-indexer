Passion of me, Besse, and Son both, these speches make me muse not haue our Daughter. Wife. Husband, husband, perhaps his mind is chaungd, or our girls portion is not great enough, and therefore now he seeks to break it off. Cur. Sits the winde there wife? ha, thinke ye so? by yea and nay, then wife he deales not well. Come roundly roundly come, what is the matter? passion of me, breake off, and for no cause? ha? Ver. Sir Thomas patience but your selfe awhile. and you shall see, that meere necesitie breakes off our match. Cur. On then a Gods name, Ver. I doubt not, but by marriage of your childe, you seeke such comforts as the sacred state, yeelds you as parents, vs as children? Cur. what else Sonne Vernon? And those high blessings, no way are attained, but by the mutuall simpathizing loue, that as combining hands so should the harts, of either partie, else it cannot be. Cur. all this is true Sonne Vernon. Ver. now then Sir Thomas, you cannot expect these comforts by our matches on neither part If you giue me her hand and not her hart, The one I know you may, compulsesiuely. the other neuer but vnwillingly Cur.

Oh what a wrong in you, were this to her, being your childe, and hope of after ioy, Oh what a wrong in me, were this to him, being my freend, my deere, esteemed frend, to rob her of her harts best happines, him of the good his gracious fortune giues: If I should hinder him, or you keepe her, from this right match, which reason doth prefer.

Enter Vernon with Hamdon and Ridley, two of his Friends. Ham. If not at our requests, yet gentle friend, For your owne safetie, change your former mind: Haue you not wealth, Whie should you leaue the Land? Rid. Are you not here of credit in the Cittie, Why should you then betray your forward hopes Upon a wilful and vncertaine humor? Ver. I know that my estate is sound and good, as on the one side strengthened with rich frends, and one the other well established by the assistance of a priuate stock: yet what is this? Or all externall pompe that otherwise is incident to men, If the mind want that comfort it should haue? beleeue me Gentlemen it is as musicke, to men in prison, or as Dainty meate brought to a sick man, whose afflicting paine hath neither left him appetite nor tast. Ham. How springs this distcontent? wherein lies this gall of Conscience that desturbs you so? Rid. We are your friends showe vs your inward griefe, And we will either finde a remedy, Or sharing euery one a part of it. So lessen it, and it shall loose his force. Ham. In it for sorrow you forsooke your Bride, and gaue your interrest to another man. Rid. You hit the naile vpon the head: tis that and nothing else that breeds this discontent. Ver. Be not deceiu'd, I did it by aduise, Nor do I any way repent me of it: She lou'd not me, albeit I honord her: and such a match what were it but to ioyne fire and water? Marriage is no toy, to be desired where there is Dislike, and therefore weighing his deserts with mine, her loue to him, and his to her againe, I rather chose to benefite my Friend, whereby two might be pleasd: than greedilie assuming what I might, displease all three. Ham. What then hath weand you from your countreys loue? Ver. Nor that, nor any thing, I know not what: yet whilst I breath this natiue ayre of mine, Methinks I sucke in poison to my hart: and whilst I tread vpon this English earth, It is as if I set my carelesse feet Upon a banke, where vnderneath is hid a bed of crawling Serpents: any place but only here (methinks) would make me happy, Say twere the meanest Cottage in the world: But here I am accurst, and here I liue. as one depriued both of soule and sence. Which strange conceit from whence it should proceed, I cannot vtter, other than from this, That I am fired with a desire to trauell, and see the fashions, state, and quallities of other Countries: Therefore if you loue me offer no further to resist in me The setled resolution of my mind. Rid. Yet since you needs will leaue vs and the Realme, go not to Ireland: The countries rude and full of tumult and rebellious strife, Rather make choise of Italy or France. Ver. My word is past vnto a Gentleman, with whom I will not breake: and here he comes. Enter Harbart and another Captaine. Har. Sir as I told you, euen at dinner time, His fury was so great, as he must needs Rise from the table to confer with me, About my speeches which I did maintaine, And sure if place had serud we there had fought, Cap. I would I could deuise to make you friends. The rather for I heare he is appointed. to haue a charg in this our Irish expedition. Ham. It is no matter: Harbart fears him not, I make as little reckoning of my bloud as he of his: and will at any time, Or when he dares meet him vpon that quarrell. Ver. Captaine well met. Harb. Maister Uernon we stay for you, Our horses halfe an houer agoe were ready, And we had backt them but we lackt your companie. Ver. Some conference with these gentlemen my frends Made me neclect mine houre: but when you please, I now am ready to attend on you. Harb. It is well done, we will away forthwith, Saint albans though the day were further spent We may well reach to bed to night. Ver. Kinde frends I now must bid ye both farewell. Ham. Naie we wil see you Mounted ere we part. (Exeunt. Enter Curtes and his Casher. Cur. Sirrha, what men are those that stay without? Cash. Some that would speake with M. Stukly Sir. Cur.

Alex. how can a Rebell or a traitor hope Of good successe against his soueraigne: Awhile perhaps he may disturbe the state, And dam himselfe but at the last he falls. Mack. I thought thou hadst despisd the English churles, Busk. Admit he did, how can he loue Oneale, But chiefly thee that was the counsellor, To cut of yong Mack Agnus our deere couzen. Mack. Not my aduise but his too sawcy braues, To great Oneale, did cause his cutting off. Busk. Speake such another word Ile cut thy throat, Thou traterous Rebell Mackener. One.

Gou.

Why then know Gouernor, here is once one that dares thrust into this harbor: That will not make thee tender of a mite, Nor cares not of a haire how thou dost take it, I will not giue one of my hobbies for thy gouernment. Gou. I will be answerable to thee for thy horses, Stuk. Doest thou keepe a tole-Booth: zounds doest thou Make a horse courser of me. Gou. Nay Sirra then ile lay you by the heeles, And I will haue them euery horse of them: Stuk.

By this flesh and bloud, Ile make thee repent it. Gou. Away with him. Exit Stukley. Lady. Yet good my Lord consider what you do Surely the confidence of this mans spirit, Showes that his bloud is either great or noble, Or that is fortunes at his owne commaund. Gou. I hold him rather to be some desprat pirat, That thinks to domanyer vpon the Land As he is vsde amongst his mates at Sea. Besides, its lesse disgrace to bear his braues, here where your power is absolute and free, And where he wholy stands at your dispose, Then in a place indifferent to either, And where you both should stand in equall termes. Gou. If I did prize his honor with mine owne, Then wife perhaps I might allow your reason, Lady.

Enter King Phillip with him Alua and Sancto Dauila, with them the Portingall embassador. Phil.

First sacred king the Soueraigne of my faith, And Portugals vndoubted supreame head, Doeth kindly greet your highnes in all loue, Next on behalfe of your respectiue care, And the league-bound of naturall amitie, Which he mistrusts not: but combines ye both as being kinsmen he intrets this boone: That whereas lately from the King of Fez, Muly Mahamet, to my royall maister, Hath honorable ambassage beene sent And great intreaty made to craue his aide, against Mullucco brother to that king, Who now intruds vpon Mahamets bounds, and building on his priuiledge of age, and inequallity of matchles strength, striues to depriue him of his diadem, It would seeme good vnto your princely selfe, as in the like we shall be readie still, at spaines intreatie to assist my lorde, With some such necessarie strength of war, As in this action may conclude a peace, to Portingalls great profit and renowne. Phil. are then Molucco and his brother king, at ciuill mutinie among themselues: Bot. They are my Lord, and many wofull daies th'afflicted Barbary hath suffred spoile, and bin a prey vnto her naturall Subiects. Phil. The right is in Molucco: wherefore then Would Prince Sebastian ayde the other part? Beside, Mahamet is an Infidell, From whose associate fellowship in this and all things else we Christians must refraine. Bot. Grace but his reasons with your milde conceit, Whereon he grounds his lawfull resolution, and mighty Philip you shall quickly find this his intent to be most honourable: Not for reguard of any supreame claime the sterne Mahamet layes vnto the Crowne, Nor any Iustice that in his behalfe May be presumde vpon, doth stout Sebastian Lyst to this motion, but for honours sake, For Portugals chiefe good, and to aduance the christian true Religion through those parts, Is he inclinde to vndertake this war. Phil. How can that be: acquaint vs with your meaning. Bot. This worthy king: tis not vnknowne to you, that diuers townes and citties scituate Within the borders of rich Barbary, Which king Emanuell conquered by his sword and left appropriate still to be enioyde, of such as should be kings in Portugall. Or, but by this preuention like to fall, and be confiscate to the Moore againe, but by an army thither brought in time, not only these great citties shall be kept, But raising this Mahamet to the crowne, And quite distinguishing his brothers claime When we haue planted him: and that by vs, The cuntrey is subdued and kept in awe, We shall not only still retaine our own But for Mahamet to subscribe to vs, And either he and his change their faith, and worship that eternall god we doe, and dissanulling be dispriued of life, And so assume the Gouernment our selues. Phill. This tastes of honor and of pollicie Might yt with like successe bee brought to passe. Bot. With your assistance: thers no doubt my lord But what we haue imagind shall ere long, be truely and effectually performd. Phill. I, But Mulluccos Army doth consist Of Dreadles Turkes and Warlike Sarazens, Is much to be suspected in this casse. Bot, What can they do though great their number be When for their single force we come in strength, Of Spaine, of Portingall, and Barbarye. Phill. Your reasons haue preuaild, what power is it Our louing cosin doeth request of vs. Bot. Of horse and foote indifferently commixte, Only ten thousand will supply his want. Phill.

That he attemptes an enterprise my leige, Will sooner breake his necke then make him great, Da. That hereby if occasion be laid hold on, That Spaine and Portingall shalbe vnite, And you the Soueraigne ruler of them both Phil. Expresse thy meaning Danulo in that point, Da. It shall not need I stand on circumstance, Your highnes knowes Sebastian once remoude, The way is open soly for your selfe, Either by force or by corrupting gold, To step into the throan, now for a meane To cut him off: what better way than this, To sooth his purpose and to draw him on With expectation of a strong supply, But when he is set forth vpon his way, And left his countrey that without reproach, And scandall to his name, he cannot retire, Then to proclaim on paine of speedy death, that not a Spaniard seeme to ioyne with him, So landed once in desart Baberie, His weakned souldiors and himselfe at once, shall fall before Mulluccos conquering sword. Alua. Meane space to coulor your intent the better, Muster your men as if you meant to aide him, But with these men assone as he is gone, approach the borders of faire Portingall, That if it chaunce Sebastian doe seruiue, the pagans sword: yet in his absence we may enter his domminions sack his towns. and take possession of the realme by force. Da. Withall dispatch, embassadors to Rome, and forthwith to intreat the Popes aduice, Who in no wise before hand we are sure, Will licence any christian potentate, to traffick or conuerse with heathen kings, and so his prohebition may excuse, and serue to cloake your breach of promise with. Whhen tis perceiud you doe do not aide Sebastian Phil.

Pro. Had we but Maddam, known which way he went, Or had himselfe tolde vs of the place, To which he purposed to make his Iourney, There had beene yet some comfort and some hope, But ignorant of both how can we choose, But be suspitious and almost despaire. Lady. Thou talkest absurdly? had we known the place The cause which made him and which way he went, What thanke were that to vs to let him goe, Where we were sure to find him out againe, Or how shoud tryall of his faith appeare, In matters of no waght or geopardy? Now being so that of our free accord Without the least respect but to his promise, He was dismist and that he cleerely sees, Tis at his charg to stay on his returne, And yet will vnconstrained keepe his vow, approues him truely loyall, vs truely louing.

He telles me my Lord: the English captaine, Is growne submisse and very tractable, and of himselfe is ready to resigne, as much as you require to haue of him, and that euen now after his counsell heard, How best he might craue pardon for his pride, His stife resistance, and adautious words, Whereto he answerd that his readiest way, Was by petition to Sollicite yon, and so he tels me, that he left him studying, How to intend some quaint conceited method, Might draw Remorse from your displeased mind. Her. Is he Prouost, become flexable? Pro. Exceeding mild and penitent my Lord, Her.

Nay let him write for writting will remaine When words but spoken may be soone forgot, It makes the better on your side my Lord, That vnder-neath his hand it shall appeare, By his consent and not by your constraint, he made sudrender of his prize to you, So shall the world what after chaunce to fall, Cleere your extortion and abuse. Her. It cannot be but he hath done ere this, I prethee see: much matter in few liues, Is quickly cought by one of meaner wit, Lady. It were not good to trouble him so soone. Her.

Cosen antonio in this heate of war, for the safetie of our royall kingdom, Let vs yet speake of things concerne our peace, although but breefe. first our deerest cosen, for your princely selfe, your right vnto the crown of Portingall, as first and nearest of our royall bloud, that should we faile: the next in our succesion, tis you and yours, to sit vpon our throne, Which is our pleasure to be published. anto. Long may my liege &amp; soueraign Lord Sebastian, Sit on the royall throne of portingall. sebast. we thank you princelly cosen, Our deare and reuerent vnckle Cardinall, vnto our selfe commit our wars in africa, for the great trust we reposse in you We do bequeath our kingdoms gouerment, As one whose wisdome and Nobilitie, Deserues the great protection of our Realme. Card. The most vnworthy of that royall place, Whose manie yeares and imbecillitie, are but too weak to vnderprop the burthen But may the remnant of my age be spent, To Portugals reliefe and your content. Sebast. Now Antonie vnto our seuerall charges, Your selfe wil share the fortunes in these wars, we do commit a Garrison of Tanieers, vnto the leading of Aluares Peres, our volintary Portingalls to Lodouico Ceasar, the mercinary spaniards to alonzo, Mereneces Leeuetenant generall of our forces, Tanara for the Germain collonell, and now set forward let our Ensigns fly, Either victorious, or if conquered die. Eeter Chorus. Cho. Thus farre through patience of your gentle ears hath Stukleys life in Comicke historie Bin new reuiude, that long ago laie rakte in dust of Africke with his bodie there: Thus farre vpon the steps of high promotion his happie starres aduaunst him. Now at highest as cleerest summer daies haue darkest nights, and euerie thing must finish: So in him his state declining drawes vnto an end, For by the Pope created as you heard Marquesse of Ireland: with that new honor, Embarkt and victualed thinke him on the Sea: and that the time sebastian had set downe to meet with Philips promist ayde is past: Toward Afrike he, toward Ireland the other, are both addrest vpon the boysterous waues: But meeting what strange accident befell, How he was altred from his first intent, And he deluded by the hope he had, To be ascribed by the Castyle King, Reguard this shew and plainly see the thing. Enter at one doore Phillip King of spaine, Alua and souldiors they take their stand: then Enter another way, sebastian, Don Antonio, Avero with drumes and ensines they likewise take their stande. Afrer some pawse Antonio is sent forth to Phillip, who with obeysance done approching away againe very disdainfully: and as the spanish souldiors are about to follow Antonio, Phillip with his drawn sword stops them and so departs. Whereat sebastian makes showe of great displeasure, but whispering with his lords each incoraging other as they are about to to depart. Enter stukly and his Italian band: who keping aloof, sebastian sends Antonio to him, with whom stukley drawes neere towarde the king, and hauing awhile conferd, at last retirs to his souldiors, to whom he makes show of perswading them to ioyn with the portugeese: at first they seeme to mislike but last they yeelde and so both armie meeting imbrace when with a sudden Thunder-clap the sky is one fire and the blazing star appears which they prognosticating to be fortunat departed very ioyfull. So far was Phillip as you haue beheld, from Lending aide vnto the Portgeese, Is not content to vndergo the Blot, Of breach of promise but with naked sword, Of vnauoided Iustice threatens such, As should but offer to depart the Land. Whereby the prince though very much disturbd, Yet not dismaid so haughty was his mind, Resolueth still to prosecute his Iourny, and whilst they are debating on the cause, stukly by weather is driuen in to them, Who being knowne what countreyman he was, What ships he had and what Italian bands, and whereto he was bound: thoffence thereof, the great dishonor and Impiety, Laid open by Sebastian, straite recants, and moues his souldiers which with much ado, at last are won to make for Barbary, No sooner was this fellowship contriude, and they had ioind their armies both in one: But heauen displeasd with their rash enterprize, Sent such a fatall comet in the aire, Which they misconstring shone succesfully, dde hast the faster furowing through the deepe, and now suppose but wo the wretched houre, and wo that damd Mahamet whose guile, this tender and vnskild yet valliant king, Was thus allurd vnto a timeles death, that in Tyrill a towne in Barbary, they all are landed: and not far from thence Doe meete that stragling fugetiue the Moore, With some small forces: what doeth then ensue, we may discourse but christendome shall Rue. (Exit. Enter muly mahamet with Calipolis drawne in their chariot, with them a messenger from sebastian. sebast. Go let ten thousand of our guard be sent, to entertaine the great Sebastian, and welcome christian to the king of Fesse, and tell the portingall thy royall maister, that africk makes obeysance to his feet, and stoups her proud head lower than his knee, tell him mine eies are thursty for his presence. mes.

Mount thee Sebastian Muly doth commaund, It is my pleasure I will haue it so, Mount thee braue Lord and sit thee on her side, and say Sebastian that the sonne of Phœbus, vpon his fathers fiery burnishd carr, Nere sat so glorious, as the portingall, Ioue would exchaung his Scepter for thy seat, and would abandon Iunos godlike bedd, Might he inioy my faire Calipolis, Welcom Sebastian loue to africa. Calip. All welcom that Calipolis can giue, To the renowned mighty Portinguyse, here sit sweet prince and rest thee after toil, Ile wipe thy Browes with leaues more sweet and soft, Then is the downe of Cithereas fans, Ile fan thy face, with the delicious plumes, Of that sweet wonder of Arabia, With precious waters Ile refresh thy curles, Whose very sauor shall make Panthers wild, and liuely smell of those Dilicious sweets and with such glorious liquors please thy tast, As Helens goblet, neuer did containe, Nor neuer grast the banquets of the Gods. Muli. Then speake the comfort of great Mulies life her teeth more white, than Cancase frosty clots, where she vnlocks the portals of her lips, Beauty a Phenix burneth in her eie, Which there still liueth, as it still doth die. Stuk. Why heers a gallant, heers a king indeed, He speaks all Mars tut let me follow such a Lad as this: This is pure fire. Euery looke he casts flasheth like lightning, Theres mettle in this Boy. He brings a breath that sets our sailes on fire, Why now I see we shall haue cuffs indeed. Ant. Now afore God, he is a gallant Prince, Muli. What Princes be these in your company? Sebast. That is our cousin Prince Antonio, The other Stukley the braue Irish Marquesse. Muli. Noble Antonio, and renowned Marquesse, ten thousand welcoms into Afryca. An. Thanks to great Muly. Stuk. To your mightinesse. Muli. Next now the neighing of our warlike horse Shall shake the pallace of commanding Ioue, Our roaring Canons teare the highest clouds, and fright the sunne out of his wonted course, Africke Ile die thy Tawny sands in bloud, and set a purple on thy Sunburnt face, This is the day thy terror first began, Before great Muly and Sebastian, Driue on, and I will lackky by thy side, these Christian Lords I trust will take no scorne, When Muli-hamet beares them company. Away, Exeunt. Two Trumpets sound at either end: Enter Mully hamet and Antonio. Anto. Second thy sonne what ere thou best that callest, and with thy proud importance greet our eares, Muly ham.

Abdel. heare braue sebastian king of portingall, sebast, O art thou there: thy selfe in presence then. What wouldst thou beg proud abdelmeleck speake, abdel. Beg, it is a word I neuer herd before yet vnderstand I what thou meanst therby, thers not a child of manly Zariks line, But scorns to Beg of Mahomet himselfe, we shall lead fortune with vs bound about, and sell her Bounty as we do our slaues, we mount her back, and manage her for war, as we do vse to serue Barbarian horse, and check her with the snaffle and the razins, We bend her swelling crest, and stop and turne, as it best liks vs hauty portingalls, sebast. weelspur your Iennet lusty african and with our pistols, weele prick her pampred sides vntill with yacking she do breake her gerths, and fling her gallant rider in the field, and say proud Moore: that so said Portingall. Abdel. Thy words do sound of honor christian king, Which makes me therefore pitty thee the more, And sorrow that thy valour should be sunke, In such a vasty vnknowne sea of Armes. Where thy bid courage, cannot beare that saile, That thy proud hauty sperit would gladly haue, Therefore Sebastian cast aside these armes that thou vniustly beares against thy friend, and leaue that traitor that but trains thee on, Into the Iaws of thy distruction. Muly. Braue yong Sebastian king of Portingall, and Don Antonio here me gallant Lords, Muly Mahamet, but you are in presence, Would thinke himselfe damnd euerlastingly, But to hold wrack with so base a slaue, Whose coward melting soule for very feare, Comes frighted vp and downe within his bosome, and faine would find a Message from his breast, So Daunted with the terror of our armes, That he is mad his souldiers will not flie, That with some coulor he might turne his back. Seest thou the power, of afriks in my hand Like furious lightening in the hand of Ioue, to dash thy pride, and like a raging storme, to teare those Turkish flags that spread their silks, vpon the strandes of peacefull africa, and quakest not slaue: with terror of the same. Hamet. Dare but my brothers Bastard and a slaue, that should haue kneeld at Abdelmelechs feet, send these proud threats from his audacious lips. Maha. Downe Dog: and crouch before the feet Of great Morocco: of mighty Fesse: But why vouchsafe I language to this Slane, Here me Sebastian: thou braue Portuguise, I Mulihamet king of mighty Sus, whose Countries bounds and limets do extend From mighty Atlas: ouer all those Lands, that stretch themselues to the Atlanticke Sea, And looke vpon Canaraes wealthy Isles, And on the west to Gibaltaras Straights, those fruitfull For-lands, and the famous townes Assure sebastian king of portingall Most glorious and triumphant victorie. Abdel. Heare me Sebastian, heare me youthfull king? and abdelmelech will receiue thee yet, And clip thee in the armes of gentle peace. forsake this tyrant and ioyne hands with me, and at thy pleasure quietly possesse, The towns thou holdest in africk at this day, Aginer, Zahanra, Seuta, Penon, Melilla, Which Muly Mahamet, will disposesse thee of, If by thy means he should obtaine the day. Sebast. Say Abdelmeleck, tell me wilt thou yet Dismise thy power, breake these rebellious armes, Which now thou bearest gainste the king of Fesse, and great Sebastian king of Portingall: Yet of Mahamet, will obtaine thy life. Hamet. Looke on the power that Abdelmeleck bringes, Of braue resolued Turks, and valiant Moores, Approued Alarkes: puisant Argolets, as numberles as be these Africks sands, and turne thee then and leaue thy petty power, the succor fayling you exspect from spaine, and bow thy knees for mercy Portingall, anto. Our very slaues our Negros, Muleters, able to giue you Battaile in the field, Then think of those that you must cope withall, The Portingall and his approued power. Muly-Mahamet and his valliant Moors The Irish Marques, Stukley and his troups, Of warlike Germans and Italians, Aluares, Ceasar, Menesis and avero, Proud abdelmeleck, kneele and beg for grace, abbel. Then proud Sebastian I deny all meanes. Maha. Therefore Mahamet and Sebastian farewell. Excursions. Enter Sebastian, antonio, auaro and Stukly In counsell together. Sebast. Aduise vs Lords if we this present night, shall passe the riuer of Mezaga here, Upon whose sundry banks our tents are picht, Or stay the morning Fresh approaching sun. aue. In my opinion let vs not remoue, The night is darke the riuer passing deepe, And we our selues and all my troops my Lord, Exceeding weary with the last daies martch. anto. My Lord Abero councels well me thinks. Sebast. Whhats your opinion Marques of Ireland? Stuk. My Lord might I perswade neither to night, Nor in the morning should ye crosse the riuer: Our men are weake, the enimie is strong, our men are feeble, they in perfect health, Beside tis better disipline I iudge, To let them seeke vs heere, than we them there, Considering what aduantage may be had, Gainst them that first attempt to passe the riuer, Againe, on this side whatsoeuer fall We haue Larassa and Morrocco both, strong townes of succor to retire vnto, Sebast. Retire vnto, talkes stukely of retreate are you inuested with a Marquesse name, Grast with the title of a fierye spirit, Renombd, and talkest so of fortitude? and lurks there in your brest so meane a thought, Can there issue from your lips a tearme, So base and beggerly, as that of flight, I rather thought that Stukley would haue said, We baite here and are not swift enough, In seeking fit time to begin the fight. Stuk. Conceit me not Sebastian at the worst, You craud my counsell and in that respect, I speake my conscience if you like it not, Condemne me not therefore of cowardise, For what I said was as a faithfull frend, Carefull we should imbrace the safest course. But as I am Tom Stukley, and a captaine, Neuer knowne yet to stand in feare of death, Rise when you will his foote that is the formost, His sword that soonest drawn my foote and sword, Shalbe as forward and as quickly drawne: Nay do but follow and ile lead the way, Ile be the first shall wade vp to the chinne, Or passe Mezagas channell, and the first Shall giue assault vnto the enemy, So little do I feare thextreamest brunt, Or hardest fortune that attends on war. Enter Muly. Muly. To armes braue king, to armes couragous Lords, Bright crested victory doeth waft vs on, And all aduantage that may be had, Offer to fill our hands with wished spoile, and chere our hearts with endles happines, False Abdelmeleck mortally is sick, For feare I thinke that we shall vanquish him, his souldiors mutinise, and his best frends, Begin to wauer and mistrust the cause, Of which three thousand of his stout Alarks, men very expert with the shielde and Launce, This night are fled to vs who likewisse tell, Of many thousands more that will reuolt, Were we but ordered once within the field, I dare assure ye had not crost the riuer, As now the day breake calles vs to labour, So that there might be expeditious means, For such as do affect vs to depart, Halfe abdelmelecks, army would forsake him. Sebast. No longer great Mahamet will we linger, We gaue direction by our pyoners, So soone as any beames of light appeard Within the East: to settle to their work, and make our passage smother through the forde, and least they loyter we our selfe in person, Will ouerlook them that by ten a clocke, Within yonder plaine adiacent to Alcazar, The lot of happy Fortune may be cast, Come Lordes and each vnto his seuerall charges. Muly. Brauely resolud, my selfe will follow you, and so it happen that Mahamet speed, I wreck not who or turk or christian bleed. Exeunt. The Trumpets sounding to the Bataile. Enter abdelmeleck and sebastian, fighting: after them againe, Muly Mahamet, and Muly hamet: then antonio: with some other passing away, then they retired back, abdelmeleck alone in the battell. Abdel. Fetch me one drop of water any man: and I will giue him Taneers wealthy Towne, The sands of africk, are so parching hot, That when our blood doth light vpon the earth, The drops do seeth like Caldrons as they stand, Tell Made like Inck it cleaue vnto the hooue, Of our fierce Ienets: which sunke vnder neath vs, Ouercome with heate: some water, water howe. soul. My Lord you haue beene very lately sicke. Running in hast. and scarcely yet recoured your disease, Withdraw your selfe out of the murdering presse: Hazzard not so the safety of vs all. abdel. Go slaue and preach vnto the droughty earth Perswade it if thou canst to shun the raine, My soule to death is thursty for reuenge, Rush through the ranks, let the proud christians know, That abdelmeleck vowes their ouerthrow. (Exit runing. Enter Sebastian. sebast. The sun so heats our armor with his beames, that it doth burne and seare our very flesh, that when we would stretch out our armes to strike, Our parched senewes crack like parchments scroles, and fly in sunder that our armes stands out stife as our Launces, and our swords fall down, Panting for breath. and stick their enuious points into the earth: Muli mah. there neuer yet was such aheat before, Since Phaiton set this vniuerse on fier, that the earth fearing he had liu'd againe. and got into the charyot of the sunn, Opens her wide mouth like a gaping wall, Hastilie. sebast. Muli mahamet say, how stands the day? muli mah. Fly, fly Sebastian: for the foe preuailes, Dugall, who led fiue thousand men of war, Is now reuolted to the enemy, farewell Sebastian, this our latest night, I will assay to saue my selfe by flight. Enter a companie set vpon sebastian, and kill him, they go out, enter a soldier bringing in abdelmeleck on his back, muli-mahamet following. muli-hamet. I euer feard that my coragious Brother, would wade so far: into this storme of war, that he would be too lauish of his person. Soul. My Lord be died not by the dint of sword: But, beeing ouercome with toile and heate, Not well recouered of his dangerous sicknes, Sunck downe for faintnes, and gaue vp his soule. Muly In the secrets maner that thou canst deuise, Conuey his royall course into our tent, for if his death should once be blowne abroad, It were a means to ouerthrow the day. Enter a souldior running. Exit souldier carrying his body. Speake slaue who has thaduantage of the day. Soul. Our valiant turques, and Moores haue got the field Sebastyan slaine: Muly Mahamet fled, And abdelmeleck crownd with victory. Muly. Shine glorious sun, and beare vnto the west Newes of our conquest: and fright those that dwell, Under our feete with Terror of our name, Raine in thy fiery palfraies yet awhile, And trot them softly on those ayrie plancks, To looke vpon the glory of the day. Exit. Enter Don Antonio, disguised like a priest fearefully Lookeing about him. Anto. Ah poore Antonio, which way canst thou take, But dredfull horror dogs thee at the heeles? Sebastian slaine, Muly Mahamet fled: All Portingalls braue Infantries slaine, and not a man of marke or note aliue. Thou glad to hide thee in a priests disgiuse, Thy Chaplen, that came with thee to the warr, and in this battell likewise lost his life. Heauen (be thou pleasd) this yet may stand in sted: If not, thy will then be accomplished. Enter three or foure Turkish Soldiors. 1. Soul. See, heers a preest yet left aliue. Sirra, come hether, how hast thou escapt; What, shall we kill him? 2. Soul. No, kill him not, first let vs ransack him. What hast thou Sirra, that may saue thy life? Anto. All that I haue my frends, ile giue ye freely, So it may please ye but to saue my life? Which to destroy will do ye little good. 2. Soul. Come then be breefe, lets see, what hast thou? Anto. This purse containeth all the coine I haue, These Bracelets my dead Lord bestowed on me, That if I scapt, I might remember him, In my deuotions and my daily praiers. 2. Soul. UUhose preest wast thou? anto. Ferdinands. duke of Aueros. 2. Soul. UUell listen fellowes twil do vs little good To kil him, when we may make benefit By selling of him to be some mans slaue: And now I call to mind the wealthy Moore, amaleck that dwelles heer in the Fesse, Heele giue as much as any man, how say ye shal it be so. 2 Soul. No better counsell can be. anto. Thy will O God be done, what ere become of me Chorus. Thus of Alcazars battell in one day three kings at once did loose their haples liues. Your gentle fauour must we needs entreat, For rude presenting such a royall fight, UUhich more imaginatian must supply: Then all our vtmost strength can reach vnto. Suppose the Soldiours, who you saw surprizd, the poore dismayed prince antonio: Haue sold him to the wealthy Moore they talkt off, And that such time as needs must be allowed, already he hath past in seruitude, Sit now and see vnto our stories end, all those mishaps that this poore Prince attend. After antonio's going out Enter Muly hamet with victorie. Soul. The certen number that can yet be found, and of the christian Lords, The Duke of averro: and the bish. of Cambra, and Portua The Irish Marques, Stukley, Count Tanara, two hundred of the cheefe nobility of Portingall, and muly Hamet, passing of the ford, Of swift Larissa to escape by flight, His horse and he both drowned in the riuer. muly. See that the Body of Sebastian, Haue christian and kingly Buriall, after his country maner for in life, A Brauer sperit nere liued vpon the same, and let the christian bodies be interd, for muly-mahamet: let his skin be flead, from of the flesh: from foote vnto the head, and stuft within: and so be borne about, through all the partes of our Dominions, to terefie the like that shall pursue, to lift their swords against their souerayn. And in Memoriall of this victory, for euer after be this fourth of August, Kept holy to the seruice of our godes, Through all our Kingdoms and dominions. Enter Stukley faint and wearie being wounded, with him Vernon. stuk. Come noble Vernon that I meete you heere, Were the day far more bloudy then it is, our hope more desprate and our liues beset, With greater perill then we can deuise, Yet should I laugh at death and thinke this field, but as an easie bed to sleep vpon. Ver. Oh maister Stukley since there now remaines, No way but one, and life must heere haue end, Pardon my speech, if in a word or two, Whilst here we breath vs, I discharg my soule. I must confesse, your presence I haue shund, Not that I hate you but because thereby, That griefe which I did study to forget, Was still renewed, and therefore when we met, In Ireland, Spaine, and at the last in Rome, and that I saw I could no way dircet, My course but alwais you were in my way, I thought if Europe I forsooke that then, We should be far enough disioinde but loe, Euen here in Aphrick we are met againe, and now there is no parting but by death. stuk. And then I hope that we shall meete in heauen, Why maister Uernon In our birth we two, Were so ordaind to be of one selfe heart, to loue one woman, breath one country aire, And now at last as we haue simpathizde, In our affections lead one kind of life, So now we both shall die one kind of death, In which let this our speciall comfort be, That though this parched earth of Barbary, Drinke no more English bloud but of vs twaine, yet with this bloud of ours the bloud of kings, shall be commixt, and with their fame our fame shalbe eternizde in the mouthes of men. Ver. Forgiue me then my former fond conceytes, And ere we die let vs imbrace like frends, stuk. Forgiue me rather that must die before, I can requite the frenship you haue showne, Imbrace. So this is all the will and testament, That we can make our bodies we bequeath, to earth from whence they came our soules to heauen, But for a passing bell to towle our knell, Our selues will play the sextons and our swords, shall ring our farwell on the burganets, Of these bloud thursty and vnciuill turks. Enter foure or fiue Italian souldiers, They lay hands on him. See where he is lay hands vpon him sirs, Stuk. Souldiers what meane ye? will you mutinise? Ver. He is your Leader doe you seeke his life? 2 To lead vs to destruction, but if he had kept his Oath he swore vnto the Pope, we had beene safe in Ireland, where now we perish heere in Aphrick but before we tast of death, we vow to see him dead. then braue Italians stab him to the heart, That hath so wickedly behauide your liues, Ver. First villaines you shall tryumph in my death, and either kill me tsl or set him free. Stuk. Heare we you bloudy villaynes. 2. Stab him souldiors. Vernon fights with some of them to saue Stukly and is slaine of them, in the meane while the rest stab Stukley Stuk. Oh haue you slaine my frend. 2. Yet doth he prate. Stuk. England farewell: what fortune neuer yet, Did crosse Tom Stukley in, to show her frowne, By treason suffers him to be ouerthrowne. Dies. FINIS.</field>
