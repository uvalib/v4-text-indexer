      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTORY SCENE. Entrance to the Chapel in the Tower of London: the interior screened off by a black curtain. Enter Fakenham. FAKENHAM. When will these vigils end; these penances Severer than the Church prescribes? Pray God Her mind give way not: sorely it is shaken. These tearful macerations of the spirit, These fasts that chain all natural appetites, Nor mortify the sinful flesh alone, Must be restrained; or death will close the scene. The very elements partake her throes. A fearful night! Fitfully lights and shadows Pass o'er the Earth, as struggling passions deepen Or blaze across the brow of Madnessânow Yon moon shines nobly through the surging cloudsâ Anon, like some poor wreck among the breakers, Whelmed in the abyss, she shall be seen no more! Enter Elizabeth with Gardiner. GARDINER [to Fakenham]. Still lies she thereâ Prostrate upon the grave-stone of Jane Grey? ELIZABETH. At your behest Lord Abbot, I am come. What would the Queen with me? FAKENHAM. Whate'er hath passed Be sure her Grace hath ever truly loved you. Therefore we trust your coming may dispel The baleful visions that enthrall her spirit; Dispersed, as fiends before rebuking Saints. ELIZABETH. You hope too much: awakened jealousy Preys on her, like the Egyptian's asp. FAKENHAM. Fear not: You are the last hope of King Henry's line. ELIZABETH. Whate'er my fate, I stand prepared to meet it. [Gardiner withdraws the curtain: Queen Mary seen prostrate on the ground. FAKENHAM. Advanceâbut with abated breath, soft footfall, As trembling mother to her sick child's bedâ [They stand watching her. The storm increases. The Queen sits up; gazing wildly round. QUEEN. Does the last hour approach?âdread consummation Of wrath divine and human agony! Artillery of heaven, thus shalt thou roar, Commingling with angelic trumpet-blasts, Precursors of the Judge! who then shall stand Upright and unabashed? unto that throne The great, the lowlyâvictim and oppressor, Shall troop; that throne girt with avenging Spirits! And there, link'd heart to heart, the slaughtered Jane, And Mary, with her bloody memory, Shall kneel, awaiting doom!âI wakeâfrom dreamsâ [Seeing Elizabeth. Say who art thou, veiled mourner, that com'st hither To water these cold stones with pious tears? Give me your hand: my knees are weak.âI part The tresses on thy brow; and gaze upon thee With the strong yearning of a blighted love. I know thee, sister!âTake me to thine armsâ And let me weep. ELIZABETH. These mingling tears wash out All venom from past sorrowâ QUEEN. Not from mine!â Immedicable evil hath infected The fount of life within me. I shall die In premature decay; and fall aside As withered fruit falls from a blasted branch. I, like a mother by her dying babe, Have closed the eyes of Hope; and o'er my heart Torpid Despair fans with his vampyre wings. âEternal Majesty! Thou seest me here A Queen hemmed in with dark conspiracies; A Christian Prince, baited by schismaticks. I call on thee for prescience to detect, Strength to control them; unsubdued resolve To execute thy judgements.âSave thy Church! Henceforth I cast aside these weeds which sully The lustre of my state; these vain repinings That enervate my soul. Unflinchingly All functions of my crown shall be fulfilled. Ay, let them rave! I am the Lord's Vicegerent! Fly, brood of darkness! for my prayer hath risenâ And God will hear, and smite, as once he smote The sin of Korah: and the earth shall ope And swallow Blasphemy: and Plagues leap forth Consuming impious men: even till the Church, Swinging her holy censer in the midst, Shall stay the pestilence; God's wrath appeased! âAnswer me not.âI rise from this cold grave, My penitential couch, with heart as frozen As the dead limbs beneath, and will unbending As this hard stone that shuts her from the world. Jane! take my last farewell! Now lead me forth To life: I commune with the Dead no more. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. A room in Whitehall Palace. Enter Gardiner and Fakenham. GARDINER. Strange are the phases of the female mind, So quick in phantasy, so slow to reason, Eager, inconsequential. Such is Mary: With thought as soaring as the eagle's flight, Swift as the storm-cloud's shadow; and as fleeting! It is our office, Fakenham, gives this insight: And to our profitâyea, the Church's profitâ Yea, the wide Kingdom's profitâmoulds it. FAKENHAM. Wisely This privilege, built up on circumstance, Must be employed, and to good ends confined; Or some rough hand will smite it down. GARDINER. Good Abbot, Are we not wakeful? Gentler confessor And wiser than art thou, hath never bowed His ear to royal whisper. It is time To test this privilege. FAKENHAM. Thy purpose, Bishop? GARDINER. The Queen must wed: the Stateâthe Church demands it. 'Tis true no dangerous competitor Is left to shake the throneâfor none looks now To the worthless Exeter. Who else remains? FAKENHAM. Why pass the noblest by?âthe Cardinalâ Reginald Pole? GARDINER. A Pope may not be King. FAKENHAM. Are you quite sure that he is Pope? GARDINER. Why doubt it? The scrutiny made sure of his election. And who hath e'er renounced that noblest crown Of earth? Besides he hath a loyal heart, And would not pluck her crown from Mary's brow. FAKENHAM. Might he not share it? GARDINER. He!âa churchman marry? You babble. FAKENHAM. No, my lord. Pole hath not taken The irrevocable vow: he is not Priest; But Cardinal Deacon: and the Holy See Hath power to absolve. GARDINER. True. CÃ¦sar Borgia Was secularized: he laid aside the purple; And was a married man, once and again; Duke of Romagna and Valentinois. More than the tonsure ladies loved his ringlets. A pregnant precedent. FAKENHAM. If you knew Pole, As I have known him, you would not sneer thus. GARDINER. I meant no sneer. His Eminence, I doubt not, Pious and shrewd: if worldly, what of that? The Clergy are but men: if young (and he, At fifty, for a Prince of the Church, is young) And lured to greatness by successful love, Men must slake thirst even at the fountain head. You were Pole's friend in youth? FAKENHAM. I knew him well: And love him yet. GARDINER. Ay, ay. This Pole has friendsâ What manner of man was he in Salisbury house, When playmate of our gracious Queen, his cousin? FAKENHAM. I knew him not till after days; a student In Padua. GARDINER. And then? FAKENHAM. A nobler presence Never embodied a more gracious soul: Ardent, yet thoughtful; in the search of knowledge Unwearied, yet most temperate in its use. Whate'er he learned he wore with such an ease, It seemed incorporated with his substance; And beamed forth like the light that emanates From a Saint's brow. GARDINER. Well, wellâat Padua You were his choice companion? FAKENHAM. No. I marked him As a far Alp: and loved to watch the sunrise Dawn on his ample brow. He lived apart, As well became his doubly glorious lineage; Grandson of George of Clarence, and last heir Of Warwick; him who, greater than a King, Made and unmade our Kings. GARDINER. But had he not A cloudy mood at times? FAKENHAM. And that became His lineage. Then he thought upon his mother, His grandsire, and those great ancestral woes. GARDINER. Speak, as you saw him. FAKENHAM. Oft have I watched him sitting For hours, on some rude promontory's edge, Wrapt in his mantle, his broad brow sustained With outspread palm, o'ershadowing his eyes. And there, as one of Titan birth he lingered In strange community with nature; mingling With all aroundâthe boundless sky, the ocean, The rock, the forestâlooking back defiance Unto the elements: as some lone column Beneath the shadow of a thunder-cloud. GARDINER. Well: as I said before, the throne stands firm; But fresher blood is needful to transmit it. Our Queen (Heaven guard her for us) is not strong. 'Twere well we had from her a healthier scion To feed the kingdom, through forth-coming time, With fruit of the same stock. The Queen must wed. FAKENHAM. Why not with Pole? GARDINER. A grave enthusiast May write a moving book, but scarce rule men. Yet hear me. He is but an Englishman; And 'tis an adage older than the hills That prophets are not honoured in their land. Trained for the crosier, not the sword, his arm Is all unequal to the stress of battle. We must look round elsewhere. FAKENHAM. Nor find another So royally endowed. GARDINER. Abstractedly, Perhaps so. But observe me, England needs A Prince whose disciplined and numerous spears Shall fence the throne from miscreant mobs at home And win respect abroad; a man whose birth Bespeaks dominion; to whom intellect Descends as an hereditary fief; Preeminently Catholicâ FAKENHAM. You know, Or had not praised this Wonder so. GARDINER. I know him. And he is Spanish Philip, son of Charles; That wisest monarch, most devout of Christians, Potent of captains, fortunate of men.â (And we should ever sail in Fortune's wake)â FAKENHAM. A bigot boy! GARDINER. I am astonished! you, A Priest, a mitred Abbot, to speak thus! This is the cant of Puritans: avoid it. It hath the smack of sin. Philip, I grant you, Is youthful: but his German tutelage And grave Castilian manners, make him old. FAKENHAM. Too young, I still aver, to wed the Queenâ At least to love her. GARDINER. Have you got the stamp Of the said Cardinal, your great ideal, Upon your metal, that you descant thus Of love? What part have churchmen, what have statesmen In leagues of love? What royal marriages? I say, Prince Philip is a proper man; Whose progeny will much advance the realm; Whose piety, inherited, protect The Church: and this all Christians leal desire. FAKENHAM. Does her Grace know your lordship's purposes? GARDINER. She hath heard affably my argument. I pray you not to name the Cardinal, (Whom doubtless, his grave dignities considered And sacred calling, she hath long forgotten As one who might have wooed, perchance have won her) I mean, good Abbot, name him not, save only As a high prelate: we will sayâthe Pope. Believe meâ FAKENHAM. You mistake her. She is changed. Passion and grief have done the work of time, And sleep in their own ashes. Her strong soul, Calm as the nether levels of the sea, The superficial tumults of this world Trouble no more with clamour. Peace, hard-won, The peace of faith, the peace of thought, the peace Of heavenly hope, and earthly hopelessness, Reign in her spirit. To her country vowed, She lives for duty only, and affects, (Wed she or wed she not,) the nation's weal, Her own not seeking. GARDINER. Tumult comes unsoughtâ Tut, Sir, the nature changes not. Her coldness Is but exhaustion. Deep is Passion's sleep While its slow energies regerminate. I say her mood will change.âJoin we the council. [Exeunt. Scene II. The Council chamber, Whitehall. The Council assembled: the Spanish Ambassador. Enter the Queen, followed by Gardiner, Winchester, Oxford, Pembroke, Bedford, Derby, &amp;c. QUEEN. Ever regardful of our subjects' wishes, And knowing that you hold our female nature Too weak, unaided, to contend with treason, We ask your counsel. Many seek our hand. I am not prone to marriage. I know well That mine is not the gift of comeliness; And too much grief hath made my mind unpliant. Therefore I fear to wed: but more I fear Good men's mistrust, seeing a lonely woman Amid so many factious, and no arm Strong to repress them. What is your advice? Speak, Chancellor. GARDINER. In this we are unanimous: Praying your smiles upon the Emperor's suit. We deem Prince Philip an auspicious match: In whose alliance England shall have pride; Your Grace abiding comfort; and the People Tranquillity through an assured succession. RENAUD. Upon our knees we humbly pray your Grace To grant Prince Philip's suit. QUEEN. Great God! direct me. Gardiner, I would consult you. Is it past doubt Our cousinâReginaldâthe Cardinalâ In very truth is Pope? Deceive me not. GARDINER. Unquestionably, Madam. Is he a Christian To spurn the captaincy of Christendom? 'Tis certain he was chosen. Holy Church Needs him. Can he stand back? QUEEN [aloud]. It must be so? My lord ambassador, we'll not refuse you. RENAUD. God save the Prince and Queen! PEMBROKE. Your pardon, Sirâ The Queen and Prince. GARDINER. Henceforth those names are mated. The consort shall partake all royal titles And powers: while this our Queen shall share with him Reciprocal advantage; and their issue Hold, not alone these kingdoms, but augmented With the broad Netherlands and Burgundy. RENAUD. To this the imperial embassy consents, Long live the royal pair! GARDINER. Amen! QUEEN. My Lords! Being a woman, it beseems me not To treat of my own marriage: but remember, This ring, which with my crown I first put on, Hath made the realm my husband before all. The faith I then impledged unto my People Must stand inviolate: look well to that; And bind me to no inconsistent duties. You will debate this leisurely. May God Direct and bless your counsels. [The lords retire. Now, my lord Bishop, Bring to our presence Ridley and Latimer. They shall enjoy free speech, and patient hearing, Ere we consign them to the secular arm. GARDINER. Your Grace shall find them obdurate. QUEEN. There may be A way to soften worse asperities. GARDINER. Nay you shall find none rougher. Enter Ridley and Latimer. They kneel. QUEEN. I am glad That you can kneel. RIDLEY. Foully have they belied us, And basely, madam, who would make you doubt The loyalty of your true English Church. QUEEN. You speak, Sir, stoutly of your Church, as though There were none greater. LATIMER. There is none. QUEEN. Methinks Less arrogance might better suit that garb. RIDLEY. God knoweth none have cause to be more humble: We stand corrected. QUEEN. I will task you, then. You, Ridley, were deputed in my troubles To tamper with my people. RIDLEY. May it please youâ I went with charge to reason with your Grace, On points of doctrine: further I deny; And would have scorned. QUEEN. Well, Sir, the men that used youâ How dealt they with me? RIDLEY. Wrongfully; I answer. QUEEN. You have good warrant to say so. Observe me. Ye took my officers, my stewards, my maidens; Ye put me to my desk to sum accounts; Ye taught me how to bake and how to brew: But there were some found faithful, who had served me, Could I, without return, have taken service. RIDLEY. These were no acts of mine. QUEEN. When you had power You strove to bar the service of my church, Even in my household: nay, you wrought my brother To twit me with contumacyâto threaten. Then made I answer that my soul was God'sâ My faith unchangeableâmy thoughts mine own. To this I pledged my head: and ye had ta'en it, Had not my cousin Charles, the Emperor, Dictated sufferance on pain of war. RIDLEY. The temper of the times in truth pressed hardly. Somewhat to have yielded had been scarcely sinful. QUEEN. Shall I retort that on you? If 'twas then An argument of worth, why not so now? What then was my condition now is your's. But I refrain. I ever have accounted Death welcomer than life with troubled conscience. I cannot think one thing and do another. GARDINER. The heretick falters. RIDLEY. Heretick I am not: True servant of the living God. GARDINER. God's Passion! Said I not how these fellows should be known? The living God forsooth! as though there were A dead one! All your babble is âthe Lord!ââ âAs the Lord liveth!â RIDLEY [to the Queen]. You would not hear God's word. QUEEN. What you now call God's word is not the same As in my father's time. RIDLEY. It never alters: Hath been, and is the same; but better known, And practised, in some ages than in others. QUEEN. It is not as you make it that I take it; But as the holy Fathers do interpret. RIDLEY. I have been wrong! God pardon me that ever I rested, or ate food, beneath a roof Where God's word was rejected. I should, rather, Have shaken from my feet the dust, departing, In testimony against you and your house! QUEEN. Fear ye not, masters Latimer and Ridley, The secular arm? RIDLEY. No earthly arm fear I. LATIMER. I should look up and laugh at every stroke Endured in the good cause. QUEEN. Fear ye not, Sirs, The Church's condemnation? RIDLEY. If the true Church, Assuredly. QUEEN. Sir, you are contumacious. By your own constitutions am I not Your lawful head ecclesiastical? You'll not deny it. Hear me then. Albeit My faith is fixed, I purpose not to shake The faith of others, further than God shall show The truth through worthy preachers: to which end All rash discourses are forbad; and readings Of Scripture, without license from ourself. Answer ye not?âWill ye conform and live? LATIMER. In all things lawful we have ever been Conformable: things evil we resist. QUEEN. I ask but abstinence from wrong. RIDLEY. Times are When mere inaction is substantial wrong. LATIMER. I testify against your abstinence Or physical, or moral:âthoughts, deeds, words; All smack of evil. We must speak or die! QUEEN. You speak and die, perchance. LATIMER. Dear brother Ridley! Be of good cheer. Whate'er betide we welcome In the Lord's name! O Queen! that day is past When spiritual knowledge was confined to priests, Our very babes drink knowledge as they suck. Each stripling, as he runs, plucks from each bough The fruit of knowledge. QUEEN. Ah, Sirs, have a care! The tree of knowledge was an evil thing, With root in hell, and fruitage unto death. But in the self-same garden likewise grew Another mystery, the tree of life. This too bore fruit, unseen till aftertime: And this was Christ. Children of Adam, we, Condemned to cultivate what first we stole, Must tend the second tree with watchful love, Or perish by the poison of the first!â No more. I called you with a good intent: Ponder what I have said; so shall ye live. Against God's manifest will vainly ye strive. [Exeunt severally. Scene III. A Street in London. Enter Underhill and Citizens of two parties. FIRST CITIZEN. What means this hurly burly? Ho! my masters, Will ye not peace when the good Queen commands it? The Council tooâ SECOND CITIZEN. Good Queenâgood Council? say you? Why do they send their knaves to preach at us? Wolves in sheep's clothing! THIRD CITIZEN. Sir, you wrong us much, Branding with epithets like these our clergy. UNDERHILL. Peace, ye uncivil brawlers! both are wrong. FIRST CITIZEN. And who art thou? meddlers are mischief-makers. SECOND CITIZEN. He is Queen Mary's servantâfie on his meddling! Hot-Gospeller forsooth! UNDERHILL. Hark ye, Sir growler, I have a hot handâhotter than my tongue, Can make the foul mouth smart that snarls on me. THIRD CITIZEN. Well-spoken, preacher! UNDERHILL. Well, Sir, what's your pleasure? THIRD CITIZEN. Come to Paul's cross, and hear our reverend doctors. You're not a man to gag soft argument. SECOND CITIZEN. Hear argument forsooth! Hark ye, I'll task you. Why vent your rancour 'gainst the late good King? It is enough to madden men.â THIRD CITIZEN. And youâ Why pray ye for our good Queen's death? 'Tis well They have made that treason. UNDERHILL. Marry, it is well. She were a generous Queen if rightly guided. But you must know, Sir, we'll not be restricted In our souls' freedom. We, Sir, have the wordâ THIRD CITIZEN. You haveâbut we the sword! SECOND CITIZEN. Away with him! He will infect usâplague upon the leper! [They chase the third Citizen away. UNDERHILL. Come, come; you wax disorderly. SECOND CITIZEN. Indeed? When Cobham wins the city worse shall follow. UNDERHILL. Peace, prithee. SECOND CITIZEN. When stout Bess shall be our Queen, There shall be plates and pottlesâyea, no fasts. And chimney nooks for preachers shall be cozy. FIRST CITIZEN. So, soâwhen shall this be? SECOND CITIZEN. There have been omensâ Two suns rose in the eastârainbows 'neath moonsâ A womanâno, a cowâhath yeaned a calf Twain-headed! FIRST CITIZEN. This is stark folly! one fool hears A voice cry from the walls of an old house, And the mob swears it is an Angel's tongue, Inveighing 'gainst this marriage. SECOND CITIZEN. When they shouted âGod save Queen Mary!ââmarkâno answer then. But when they shouted, âSave Elizabeth!â The voice replied âSo be itââBeing asked What is the Mass? it said, âIdolatry!â UNDERHILL. Pshaw! Straight the council had the wall pulled down; And lugged forth a young girl who made confession. Queen Mary packed her to the pillory. Her father would have hanged. FIRST CITIZEN. Another day Some giddy boys played Wyatt and the Queen, And scratched and kicked, till blood flowed ruefully. Nay, one, to spite the Queen, they nick-named Philip; And left half-hanged. What said her Grace to this? âLock up the urchins for an hour or so, And whip the most pugnacious.â SECOND CITIZEN. Still, I say, Down with the scurvy Spaniards! down with all Papists! UNDERHILL. To the rescueâOfficers! [A riot ensues. Shouts heard outside, âLong live Queen Mary!â Enter the Queen, Lord Mayor: Livery &amp;c., &amp;c. LORD MAYOR. This shall be righted. QUEEN. Disobedient servants! Such things ye dared not in my father's time. O that he were alive but for a month! MAYOR. In faith we'll see to this. QUEEN. Sir, all these evils Lie deeper than ye wot. The fount of honour Is poisoned at its source. My grandsire, father, And then my brother, raised base parasites To dignities, not honour: cankered the peerage: Tainted the prelacy with fanaticks: Raised quibbling casuists and venal pleaders To the judicial bench, soiling the ermine Which should be spotless as the sleeves of Moses When he received the tablets of the lawâ There are among ye men not scrupulous; Who don or doff their faith like roomy cloaks, As suits occasion: men whose loyalty To church and Queen is plastick, and fits well The ascendant ruleâThese sycophants would crush The People, overleap the Law, cajole Their Prince, betraying all! [Murmurs among the Queen's suite. Why murmur ye? ARUNDEL. The People are beholden to your Grace. QUEEN. Not to the People only, but to you, Likewise, I speakâproud Nobles! Be ye observant. ARUNDEL. In faith I see notâIâwhat cause we give That thus your Grace should publicly rebuke us. QUEEN. 'Tis for your good. Look to it. I would address Some words to the People generally. Search out Some platform whence my voice may freely spread. ARUNDEL [aside]. Oxford, come hitherâIs it not laughable To mark the exactions of servility Wrung by these Tudors from the best o'the land, As the majestic Kings of olden times, The high Plantagenets had never asked? Whatâmust weâVeres and Howardsâtruck and kneel Before the old Knight's progeny? Shake off Thy cerements, stout Sir Owen! and laugh out To see what anticks thine old bones begot! Bear we this taunting? OXFORD. These new men it touches; Not us. The Yorkist chose to plant his garden With gay weeds, not true roses: what came of it? My grandsire smote the louts on Bosworth field, And left the crook-back Dickon on the grass, Outstaring the hot sun with his dead eyes. Little deemed he when Harry Richmond donned The crown wrenched from the Dead, that his descendants Should thus be rated by ungrateful tongues:â ARUNDEL. Hush! Gardiner's heavy eye wanders: his ear Is omnipresent as the cuckoo's voice. OXFORD. Hear ye the Queen! So saith mine office. QUEEN. Citizens! HERALD. Keep silence! QUEEN. I stand here to face all traitors; And their weak machinations to expose! Ye know me as I am, your rightful Queen: And your allegiance, sworn when I was crowned, Ye will maintain. UNDERHILL. That will we to the death! MANY VOICES. God save the Queen! QUEEN. Then, too, did I take oaths: Whereof this spousal ring upon my finger Bears witness. That I am your lawful Queen All Christendom allows; your Parliaments Oft have confirmed. Ye who so lovingly Obeyed my father, ye will not now desert His daughter, baited by unliegeful carls? A CITIZEN. Down with the rebel curs! ANOTHER CITIZEN. God bless Queen Mary! QUEEN. I cannot tell how, naturally, a mother Loveth her children, for I ne'er had any: But if our subjects may be loved as children, Be sure that I as earnestly love you As mothers can. A CITIZEN. Bless your pale face! QUEEN. And I Think you love me. A CITIZEN. That will we, noble lady! QUEEN. Touching this marriage, think me not desirous Of wedlock. Hitherto I have lived a maiden: But were God pleased that I should leave you sons It might be for your welfare. Yet if I saw Aught dangerous to my People in this marriage I would renounce it. A CITIZEN. May you be happy in it! QUEEN. On a queen's word, if my good lords and commons Mislike this bridal, it shall never be. Therefore pluck up your heartsâstand fast like true men! Nor fear those rebels whom your Queen fears not. CITIZENS. God bless Queen Mary, and the Prince of Spain! QUEEN. Mother of God! that cry is victory! A VOICE [behind the Queen]. 'Twere well you spake less harshly of your friends! QUEEN. Who said those words? Some upstart I'll be sworn! Respect me, if but for my father's sake, Who out of nothing made you what you areâ Oxford, your arm! your grandsire's arm at Bosworth Nobly upheld my grandsire at his need. Be thou his grandchild's stay. Lead on, my lord. [Exeunt Queen, &amp;c. &amp;c. ARUNDEL. Ay, flattery is sweet: now Oxford's brow Throbs for his dukedom. Is it for our sins That we must here perforce have woman Rulers? The barbarous Briton loved them; but we Saxons And Normans, spurned them. Vain were thy struggles, Maude! No sceptre graced Elizabeth of York. But now the great stem of Plantagenet, Rest of its males, bears none but female blossoms. If Mary fail, Elizabeth succeeds. The Tudor sisters dead, from Scotland then Shall Mary Stuart ride forth: or in default Of these, Jane Grey's young sisters, or their mother; Or Elinor of Clifford. Welladay! If henceforth lances must give place to needlesâ Gauntleted hands to bright eyes and soft lipsâ 'Twere well methinks to cry, âGod save King Mary!â [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. Gallery over gateway, Whitehall Palace. Queen's ladies enter in confusion: after them the Queen attended by Gardiner and others. GARDINER. Madam, we fear all's lost if you rest here. We pray you to take refuge in the Towerâ Your boat lies ready manned at Whitehall stairs. QUEEN. Fly? never! Arundel and Oxford true, My foot stands firm! Enter Caley. Sir Henry Jerningham Bids your Grace fear not for Saint James' Tower. Bull-headed Cobham batters it in vain. But much we doubt weak Ludgate may be forced. QUEEN. What rampant knave is he, who in the front Of brave old Gage, makes Charing pavement ring With his black, foaming charger? CAYLEY. Captain Knevett. QUEEN. Knevett or knaveâan if he spurred as hotly As he can rein, the good old knight were down. Ho! by the Rood! the knave can spurâand see, Sir John rolls in the dustâO save him, knights! GARDINER. Will not your Grace retire? this oriel window Is perilously sloped to rebel shafts. What if thus strickenâ QUEEN. Haply I should die; And thus these woes surcease. GARDINER. And were that well For England? QUEEN. In good sooth, I think not so. I will be wise and wary. Lo! brave Southwell Draws up his battle-axes in the front; And shall protect us. [She leans from the window. Gentlemen, in you We place our trust: abandon not your post. GARDINER. The troops give wayâ QUEEN. Then I will lead them on! Bring helm and cuirassâthough this hand can wield No sword, at least it can direct a horse; And teach you how to ride a rebel down. [Exit attended. MARY DOUGLAS. Bears not our Queen a valiant heart? Behold her Forth issuing from the gate, beckoning her men. Nor shot of arquebuss, nor push of pike, Heeds she. Hark!âwhat a shout! Her work is done! Re-enter the Queen attended. QUEEN. We have struck well: the Lord of Hosts be praised! And rash rebellion grovels in the dust. Vengeance has done her part. Be it our care That no just ground of discontent remain. Summon the council: much is to be done. GARDINER. An edict setting forth your Grace's title Should be prepared. QUEEN. Be careful, clearing that, To cast no stigma on my sister's birth. Too much for England's peace may be inferred. Enough for me that union whence I sprung, Which Thomas Cranmer most ungodlily And against law, by wresting texts and reason, Dissevered, now is held inviolate. Stablish my throne, remembering I am mortal. Take heed to ope no quicksand that shall swallow Succeeding thrones. Save England with my sister. There is no evil like domestic war. [Exeunt. Scene II. A Street in London. Enter Underhill to Sandys, Weston, and Rioters. UNDERHILL. Why come you thus abroad? the times are wildâ SANDYS. If the Lord be on my side, why should I fear? Mysterious are his ways! I will endure His chastisementsâand blessed be his name! UNDERHILL. Pray you, retire. 'Tis an ill zeal that plucks The beard of fortune. SANDYS. Edward Underhill! I am ashamed to meet a man so changed! That one who from the well-head undefiled Hath tasted of eternal verities, Should so backslide! UNDERHILL. I have not time to wrangle. Firm is my faith, but I to her am loyal Whom the Lord gives to rule o'er Israel. SANDYS. See ye the fruit!âA governor from God?â UNDERHILL. The Queen is not well served. You heard yourself, How, leaning from the Holbein gallery, Where she so long stood target to your shafts, She bade her furious knights to spare; and spake Peace to the suppliant throng. SANDYS. Yet your fierce captains Do ramp along the streets with bloody staves Hunting the white-faced citizens like rats; Or at their own doors summarily hang them. No house but sends forth lamentable wails Of orphans and poor widows; wounding the ear As harshly as their gashes do the dead. UNDERHILL. Not fifty thus have diedâa sorrowful sum If measured by domestic pangsâyet small If balanced by the evil of their plots; Small if contrasted with the precedents Of former feuds. In Henry's time, they say, Full seventy thousand their viaticum Had from the hangman. SANDYS. Miserable Land! See how God's wrath hath stricken! Now at length Hath he begun to punish; as long since Prophets have threatened. Lo! each heart, each hand, Each tongue of Englishman is set against His neighbour: the broad realm is rent asunder. England! thou ship tossed on tempestuous waters! Thy crew in mutinyârocks on thy leeâ A maniac grasps thy helm! England! that knew'st not When thou wert blestânow desolation sweeps thee! Yet, yet, obey thy Godâreceive his Word. So shalt thou yet find mercy! WESTON. Out upon thee! Unmannerly Ranter! SANDYS. Ha! I will not shrink, From the good fight. Say on, besotted man! WESTON. Were ye God's children, surely God would bless you, And prosper your endeavours: but behold, Your doctrine is abjured, and its professors Most soundly rated by good men: and therefore Ye cannot be of God. SANDYS. O thou Iscariot! WESTON. Nay, thou shalt hear me out. This is of God Which our good Queen and Bishops do profess. Lo! how God prospers them! How notable The victory wherewith he hath enlarged her! Ye Gospellers! how many have come back From your vain textsârejecting your vain doctrine! Once we had plenty in the land: but now There's nothing like as was. But let that pass. You thought your Gospel was ensconced for ever With statutes: welladay! new laws pass now Contrariwise upholding what ye banned. This shows your doctrine cannot be God's law. UNDERHILL. Be thou rebuked, O Sathanas!âIf men Had godly wit, in their Queen's victory They might discern that God would hereby win her, By kindness to his Gospel. Furthermore Because that they who went against her put Their trust in carnal weapons, not the Lord; In this they erred. Some have recanted, say you? Yea verily:âtheir seed was cast on stones, And withered. Such for gain took up the Cross; And, for gain, lay it down. Your Parliament Pass laws (I say it stoutly), not by reason, But clamour. 'Tis the many not the better Who rule. We'll bleed for this in coming time! A CITIZEN. Awayâawayâis this a time for preaching? Away! the pitiless Riders are upon us! [Great uproar withoutâExeunt dispersedly. Scene III. Council Chamber, Whitehall, Queen, Egmont, Renaud, Gardiner, other Lords. QUEEN [kneeling]. God be my witness that my sole desire Is England's welfare in this marriage. Never Should lip of man approach my maiden cheek, Nor change come o'er my chaste and honest life, But that a dearer interest than mine own Compels me. Count of Egmont, take my troth To Philip and to Spain. EGMONT. And here King Philip And Spain impledge their faith to thee and England. MARY. O pray with me, and for me, my good Lords, That God may make these nuptials fortunate! EGMONT. I take your royal hand, and with this ring, In my master's name, espouse you. QUEEN. I accept it; And will return him faith inviolable. EGMONT. May Heaven protect my Queen! perhaps your Grace Will deign send missives by me? QUEEN. Bear my love And gentlest commendations. 'Twere not meet That I wrote first. Tell himâyet no: nay, tell him I count the minutes till he come. RENAUD. Permit me To be so bold as to suggest 'twere prudent His Grace delayed, till treason be put down. Too many prisoners your Grace releases. QUEEN. It was the custom of my forefathers To pardon criminals upon Good-Friday. I have released but eight. Of these, Northampton, Queen Katherine Parr's own brother, took no part In the late treasons. RENAUD. Pardon meâthere may be Some guiltierâour Prince must be kept back, Should your Grace yield to mistimed clemency. This book may show how traitors should be crushed. QUEEN. My Lord, I read the Greek in his own tongue, And need not French expositor to gloss The venerable text. Our English law Shall better guide us than Hellenick legends. We lean on Alfred not Thucydides. RENAUD. Forgive my plainness. Can King Philip come While criminals remain unjustified? Your sister waits her trial. GARDINER. Let me speak. While she, the Princess, lives, there is no safety For England, for the Church. If all your servants Went to work roundly, as I do, your Highness Were better servedâHow now, Sir? whom seek you? Enter Bridges Lieutenant of the Tower. BRIDGES. Your Grace will pardon, if, in a case like this, Your servant feels misgiving. This sealed warrant Commands me yield the Princess; to be dealt with As sentence shall direct. QUEEN. O thou good servant! Thy Queen, on her heart's knees, thanks and rewards thee. Whose is this deed?âBy God's death! answer me! Ay, Gardiner, thou shalt answer for this thing, If thou hast done it. GARDINER. Let me see the paper. A sorry trick to fright the Princessâtrust me, I had no hand in it. [He tears the warrant. QUEEN. Inhuman hounds! That worry your poor victim ere you slay it. But I shall baulk your malice. Silence, Gardiner! Too much already hath been said: your tongues Are deadlier than poison. Bridges, through you, Who pitied poor Jane Grey, I shall henceforth Secure my sister. You have known and loved her. You are my servant now. Receive your knighthood. [She knights him. He retires. RENAUD. My liegeâfor such my lord's betrothed is nowâ Pardon that I have chafed you. QUEEN. You have waked A devil within my heart and in my brain! Your master, on my soul! sanctioned not this. RENAUD. The King wills nought which can offend his Queen. But, Madam, you have hardly judged my words, Misconstruing their purpose. Not the death, But the removal of the Princess seek we. Removal, was it not, my lord? We feared To hurt your Grace, and spake in ambages. GARDINER. I meant to say, while here the Princess lives This realm and church, are perilled. Is that false? QUEEN. I'll have no double-meaning speech, nor tricks To frighten or mislead. Look to it: or bide The consequence. RENAUD. Then, unambiguously, I counsel that your Grace remove from England The Princess by a bridegroom's sweet compulsion. No lack of suitors. Philibert of Savoy Proffers his hand to fair Elizabeth. QUEEN. We thank the princely suitor: but our sister Mates not with the deposed of Piedmont. RENAUD. Perhaps your Grace would yield your royal sister To the kind keeping of the Hungarian Queen. With such a noble matron, watchful, virtuous, She might rest well and safely. QUEEN. Be content, Sir. My sister hath but one friend in this council; Myself, companion of her youth. It may be She hath compassed ill against me: yet will not I, Who fostered her lone childhood, now destroy her By death or exileâYou are malcontent. Conform ye to my will; I shall not swerve. RENAUD. The Queen's will shall be law! QUEEN. See well to that! [Exeunt. Scene IV. The Queen's Closet. Enter Queen, followed by Elizabeth. ELIZABETH. You would not see me when I sent the ring: The token of your love, that was to guard me If anger grew between us. QUEEN. When this outbreak First threatened, and malicious tongues impeached My sister's faith, I sent for you to Ashridge. I prayed you on your love to come to court, And pledged you mine. You came not; pleaded sickness. I waited long: then sent Lord William Howard, Your mother's uncle, with my own litter for you, And three physicians. ELIZABETH. Was I not most sick? QUEEN. Ay! sick at heartâsick with unlawful longings For an untimely heritage. You sought When circumstances frowned, and charges grew Against you, to assail me with your tears, Win with caresses. Then I answeredâNo. We meet not till your conscience and your acts Shall be as a crystal which the sun shines through. ELIZABETH. My conscience is unflawed, unstained. You see Shadows, not mine, behind it, not within it. This is not just. QUEEN. Elizabeth I love you; And therefore seek to favour: but I rule you. Justice demands this of me. It was well That by the old law, which my act restored, I have abided: thus you rest secure, No overt act of treason proved. I tore The ciphered manuscripts which, they alleged, Inculpated my Sister. God forefend That any, far less one so dear, should fall By evidence so easy to be forged. You stand acquitted. God, who sees all hearts, Grant you be clear from sin! ELIZABETH. Upon my knees; And gazing on you through my streaming eyes, I do protest my truth and loyaltyâ I ask no favour, I implore no pardon. QUEEN. Well, well! belike as you so stiffly stand Upon your truth, we have dealt wrongfully. ELIZABETH. Your Sister must not say so to your Grace. QUEEN. But you will so report. ELIZABETH. Believe me, never. This burthen I have borne and still must bear: Yet humbly, as your loving Sister, crave Your kind construction. QUEEN. Be it so. God knoweth! I thus replace your ring; pledge of new love. Or innocent or guilty, I forgive you. [Exeunt. Scene V. Antichamber, Whitehall Palace. Enter Gardiner and Fakenham. FAKENHAM. You seem disturbed, my Lord; yet all things prosper Even as you wished. The King is on the sea: The Queen right joyous in her match: the People If far from satisfied, appeased. GARDINER. The People Must be broke into questionless obedience; Or they'll not suit King Philip. Never knew I A horse well managed save with whip and bit. Touching religion (thus speaks Latimer) We must plough fast, plough deep, plough skilfully. No less say I. The Queen is all our own. She would press argument on argument. But Fakenham, wot you of no shorter method Wherewith to deal with traitors? FAKENHAM. We who grant The spiritual supremacy of Popes, Of the three parties which divide the realm Are weakest. We are strong but in the Queen. That church was Catholick which Henry stablished; Though Antipapal: and it stood confest A favourite in the land, though stained with blood, Plunder and tyranny. The Puritan, Dexterous in reasoning, clamorous in debate, And in his protest fierce as blatant beast, Commands the vulgar throng. GARDINER. What matters it If the Queen now strike home? FAKENHAM. My Lord, your cry Is ever âStrike.â GARDINER. And who bade Jehu strike? Go to! Were Korah, Dathan, and Abiram Worse men than Cranmer and his crew? I marvel That one, knowing the Queen so inly, doubt How she will act, if with discretion guided. When Philip comesâsoon may that be!âmy friend, You have known Philip. Touching his externals, I cannot praise his portrait: but his mind Will suit us. What say you? FAKENHAM. A moody man, Whose countenance is ghastly, bearing dismal: For ever wrangling, rude. His glance is sinisterâ Stealthy: his laughter a sardonic sneer. I would rather face a vulture o'er a corpse, Than such a man, whose hell is in himself. He is a tree of deathâ GARDINER. Whose seed shall be For life. Beware. You have a caustic brush: The canvass burns beneath it. FAKENHAM. There are strange rumours How that his first wife died mysteriously. GARDINER. Mysteriously? mysteriously? God's passion! Women will die!âWhat boots it how she died? FAKENHAM. Muchâto our Queen. GARDINER. You ne'er will be a Bishopâ A shrewish tongue! look you, Sir, what's to me, Or you, or any man, how 'twas she died? The woman's dead. God give her rest! tis well. And he is free. Tis very well. Ask not Why? 'twas God's will: if not, she had not died. Enough of thisâwe'll talk if talk you must, Of something profitable. Cease these jars Answering no end, but wasting loveâthe Queen! Enter Queen. QUEEN. The airy spirit of my heart takes wing, And flies to its repose! no more my brain Teems with fantastic images that grew To vices in their sheer exorbitance. I shall be all I ever hopedâyes, Fakenham, All, with God's help, your lessons would have made me. FAKENHAM. May you be wise unto salvation, daughter! Beyond this, even for my queen, I pray not. Enter Oxford. OXFORD. The King, my liege, will land this eve at Hampton. QUEEN. O joyful news! Haste theeâyet stayâTake this The collar of St. George: I would have sent The crown, if England willed it. Say that I, Grandchild of Isabella of Castille, Who knew so well to govern, yet obey, Will yield implicit honour to my spouse. Attend his Highness hither; and as beseemeth A faithful counsellor, advise whate'er Shall to his glory redound. Away, away! [Exeunt Oxford and the Queen. GARDINER. Is this your statue of eternal rock, Or adamant unshaken?âSaid I not The mood would change? FAKENHAM. The change was sudden.âSlowly Her first despair to penitence gave way, And thoughts of public duty. Duty done Ministered peace: and health and hope succeeded. A gradual process this. Now, like a plant Of tropic growth, her heart sends up, renewed, Its loving aspiration after love; Which wife-like duty, and religious vows Auspiciously (so seems it) shield and sanction. God help thee, heart betrayed! GARDINER. God grant King Philip Health, and a hand unsparing. Soâfarewell. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. An open space in the woods near Winchester. Enter Philip, Egmont, &amp;c. A storm. PHILIP. A sorry day for our solemnities! I kiss this crucifix. Avert the omen! Most holy James of Compostella!âHalt! A cruel windâa rain that chills my blood! Egmont, observed you, how those surly lords Scowled as they rose up from their stiff-bent knees, As though, pardie! they had a mind to say, âWhy doff you not, Sir King, your barret cap?â EGMONT. They shall be taught, my liege, the courtesies And homages of Spain ere long. PHILIP. Good Saints! What must I suffer in this pestilent land? If I put off this cloak I shall be drowned; And smothered if I wear it! There's no force In English prayer (for surely they have prayed) If this be a fit greeting for a Prince, Thus wending to their ancient gentlewoman. Egmont! methinks I spied a pretty maid At Hampton in the church of Holy-rood, Where we made our thanksgivingâMany such They say this England nurtures. That is well. EGMONT. I trust your Grace will shrewdly take to task This admiral Howard, who laughed to see our sailors Elbowed and hooted when we first touched land. PHILIP. Ha! when have I forgotten? EGMONT. And that insult, When he bade strike our topsails, as his right From all in the narrow seas. PHILIP. I shall remember The admiral when it suits me.âWho comes hither Unlaced and hot with posting? Step you forward, With hand upon the hilt. Enter Underhill. UNDERHILL [kneeling]. The Queen sends greeting Unto your Highness with this ring. PHILIP. Its purport? UNDERHILL. I know not. PHILIP [retiring]. Nor I you. Come hither, Egmont. You know their speech: examine him; 'tis strange. Some token of danger it may be. UNDERHILL. The Queen Hoped, lovingly, you rode not in this storm. PHILIP. No more than that? 'Tis well. Sir Englishman, We knights of Spain make light of storms like these. Nor man nor storm fear we. UNDERHILL. Dread not the first. Lord King! we Britons strike in war alone. PHILIP. I am glad to know it. Sharp in retort I see. Your English way I trow: but hark you, sir, 'Tis scarcely safe to bandy words with Kings; Or hang too closely on their skirts, to catch The careless thought just trickling into speech. My Lady's servant, prithee look to this. On, sir! what, Egmont, may we trust our guide? EGMONT. I'll warrant him a trusty. PHILIP. It were needful. Choked with this sleet, half smothered in these bogsâ What a climate! what a country! what a people! Yet doth my stomach yearn for sack and manchet. Truly your hunger is a grievous thing, Yea an unruly! If he delay, good Egmont, Just hint what perils edge a prince's anger. They say your Saxon churl loves generous viandsâ Methinks they are scanty, or the mouths too many. What crowds blackened the beach! each rock, each hill Looked verminous with dusky multitudesâ If God take none to his glory, there shall be lack. [Exeunt. Scene II. Cathedral interior, Winchester. Enter to marriage ceremonial, Underhill, Sandys, &amp;c. The storm continues. SANDYS. This is the consummation of our wrongsâ O wicked match! and none will have more cause To rue it than this woman. UNDERHILL. God forbid it! SANDYS. Forbid this match; but not its consequence. She doth contemn God's wordâher father's lawsâ And brands her brother as a heretick. Yea, barters her broad kingdom for this tyrant. UNDERHILL. I mourn these things with youâall past amendment. SANDYS. Lo! how these Dons vaingloriously come prancing! Castile and Arragon shall lord it well, In London city. Have a care, my masters! Of your fair dames, domains, and equipage, Your shady forests, and well-stocked preservesâ The spoiler's furtive eye now gloats upon them! UNDERHILL. You'll be observed. SANDYS. I care not. See, base Gardiner Rolls onward like a shark gaping for prey. Shall nothing glut thy maw, foul beastâbetrayer Of thine own landâsalesman of liberty? Enter Bishops of London, Winchester, Durham, &amp;c. After them Philip and suite: then Queen Mary, Elizabeth, Margaret Douglas, Gage, Nobles, &amp;c. GAGE [to Sandys]. Keep silence, Doctor Sandys, or you shall rue it. UNDERHILL. Nay, hold thy peace: if careless of thyself, Spare one who brought thee hither. HERALD. Silence, Sirs! FIGUEROA. I, Count of Figueroa, Regent of Naples, Salute the Queen of England, in the name Of the most potent Charles, the Emperor; Who this day by my hand, resigns his kingdoms Of Naples and Jerusalem to Philip, His much loved son: and doth hereby declare His pleasure in this bridal; mating thus Royal to Royal. If impediment Be known to any, let him speak. [King and Queen approach the Altar. The storm encreasesâthunder and lightning. SANDYS [speaking from the crowd]. A voice From heaven replies in anger: and a voice From man in warning: and a cry, O Queen! From the universal Churchâbeware, beware! PHILIP. Saint Jago! wherefore seize ye not the traitor? Ha! brave Castilian Knights! GARDINER [aside]. Heed him not, Sire. Some solitary malcontentâI know him. Dungeon and rack shall not be spared. [Aloud] Who gives The Queen away? [a pause] Whose oversight is this? Fools! not to have foreseen so plain a case. [Aside. Who gives her Grace away, I ask? [Pembroke, Derby, and Bedford approach. We give her, In the name of the whole realm. PEOPLE AROUND. God save the Queen! God save King Philip likewise! [Philip offers a diamond ring. QUEEN. Nay, my Lord,â I would be wed like any other maiden With the plain hoop of gold. PHILIP [putting on a gold ring]. Then thus I wed thee. [Proclamation of styleâJubilant musicâthe Procession retires from the Church. The storm continues. SANDYS. A heavier day for England and the Church Never hath closed in tempest. Lo! the heavens Do speak their malison! it is God's anger That flashes round us! mark these omens well. [Exeunt. Scene III. Hatfield. Elizabeth alone. ELIZABETH. Man fears too muchâtoo soonâtoo causelessly! Again I live for hopeâdespond no more! O Hope! whose wings fan heaven, I woo thee back To earth, thy needful home; the tilth whereon We shake thy goodly seed. To sowâto reapâ Are they not one? the effort is fruition! Enter Egmont, Oxford, &amp;c. How now? I would be mistress of my timeâ Why come ye, Sirs, unbid? EGMONT. With missives, Madam, From my lord King. Methinks they'll please you well. ELIZABETH. Sincerity is Honour's nursing mother! I tell thee, Spaniard, nought from him shall please. EGMONT. My lord of Oxford shall avouchâ ELIZABETH. Say on. EGMONT. The King's grace, and the Queen, with hearty love Commend them to your Highness; hailing you Right heiress of the realm. The Council, too, In such wise add their duty. ELIZABETH. With equal greeting Elizabeth replies; thanking the Peopleâ The People first, the People last, and only; Who ever have upheld and will sustain her; As her undoubted blood and taintless rightâ (Ay taintless right in eyes ye cannot blind) Demand. And, noble Spaniard, hear me further: There lives within this heart a stirring pulse Which shall make good its royal destinies. EGMONT. The People! weather-cocks your Grace may find them. Be wary. ELIZABETH. Sir, contemn them not! who makes A mirror of the sapphire or the diamondâ And not betakes him rather to plain glass, Within whose broad reflexion we behold Truth undistorted? EGMONT. Madam, I have done. But do they murmur? are not the People quiet? ELIZABETH. Ay, sir, as slaves! the free proclaim their griefs, Like beggars in the street. The slave who fears In every hand a lash, is voiceless. He Who under wrong is silent, hoards his vengeance. Fear most who least complain. Judge, Sir, how far I am beholden to King, Queen, or Councilâ Or Nobles of the land. What friends stand by me? Faithful in danger? Wooton, Mason, Cecil. These are not Noblesânoble though they be. Strong in the People's love, dare ye assail them? Behold where lies my safety! EGMONT. Not less safe Shall be the Court, to which we sue your presence. ELIZABETH. Sir, be content. I go not yet. My sister Must, as a wife, be to her spouse compliant. And thus that rule prevail which I abhor. OXFORD. Madam, not so. The Queen's known constancy, Proved thoroughly when the need was exigent, Shows she will nothing yield adverse to honour, Through weakness. Wives may be submiss to husbands: But a wise Queen shall seek wise counsellors, Whereby ensue wise measures. ELIZABETH. She shall seek And shall not findâmy father never found them. Wise counsellors shall for themselves be wise, And lock their lips. The King shall name the Council. OXFORD. Madam, in England Parliament hath power To chain up sycophants and bridle tyrants. ELIZABETH. You may so say. Pray God it prove so! but There shall be much ado. Have you not travelled? How rule the Spaniards (pardon, Count of Egmont!) In Naples, Sicily, and Lombardy? Are these oppressed not? Say, are bonds and buffets To them unknown? look too for these in England. Gently and fairly shall they speak at first: But waxing strong, then shall they filch your ships, Your fortsâusurp your offices; ascending The topmost tower of tyrannous acquest. EGMONT. Rule we in Flanders thus? Are Englishmen Compliant beyond Flemings? ELIZABETH. Peradventure If tempted sorely, we may not content you. EGMONT. There shall be no temptation. ELIZABETH. None? so be it! My lords, ye have my answer. Fare ye well! [Exeunt severally. Scene IV. Queen's Cabinet, Whitehall. Queen, Philip, Gardiner, Lords and Council. QUEEN. I am far from well, my lords, as you may see. God lays a heavy hand on me. His will Be done! I take the privilege of sickness To meet you here, not in full parliament. Before the coming of his Eminence The Legate, hourly looked for, I would explain Our exigencies. PEMBROKE. Without doubt your Grace Should have full satisfaction. QUEEN. I would urge you (What less shall please, but to your souls hereafter Be of true comfort) that you reconsider The Church's claim for spoils that you have takenâ PEMBROKE. Your father tookâ QUEEN. Well, Sir, he took for you. PEMBROKE. Our swords protect the Church: our lands surrendered, Our swords are swords of glass. QUEEN. Greedyâtoo greedyâ Are ye, my lords, of pelf. I find you, truly, Pliant, fair-spoken: but, your mammon touched, The lands filched from the Church, ye tap your swords, And cry, âWe part not with our abbey spoils!â PEMBROKE. They were fair grants, the guerdon of fair service. Your father's gift our swords are bound to guard. QUEEN. So be it! I must be content, I see, With setting good example. I devote What to the crown pertains to foster learning, And feed the poor. PEMBROKE. How then support the crown, With an impoverished purse? QUEEN. Sir, I prefer My peace of conscience to all crowns of earth. [A discharge of ordnance without. Enter Sir John Gage. GAGE. The Cardinal Legate's boat hath touched the beach. QUEEN. The Cardinal arrived! my dear, dear Cousin! Go, my lord Chamberlain,âgo, Sir John Gage, And bear our greetings to his Eminence. Let his Legantine cross be borne before him; And all appliances of holy state Attend his blessed footsteps. This, our King, And we, shall welcome him on Whitehall stairs. [Exeunt Oxford and Cecil. PHILIP. You are right gracious to the Cardinal. In Spain we condescend less. QUEEN. Ah! you'll love him, As I do, when familiarly you know him. PHILIP. I somewhat doubt it. You were sick, you said;â Too sick to issue forth and meet your Commons. QUEEN. 'Tis but a score of paces. I would fain Show fitting reverence to a holy man. PHILIP. As you will, Madam. Ho! the pageant waits. Her Highness' self shall usher through the gates! [Exeunt. Scene V. Council Chamber, Whitehall. Queen and King throned. Lords, &amp;c. seated round. Enter Cardinal Pole, attended by Prelates, &amp;c. GARDINER. The parliament of England heartily Speaks welcome to your Eminence. My lords Of the upper house! my masters of the nether! I here present to you the most reverend father, Lord Cardinal de la Pole; Legate a latere From the Apostolick See; ambassador On the weightiest matters which can affect the realm. My lords, lean to him with accordant ears. CARDINAL. Since it hath pleased the Almighty counsels, Madam, To call you to this throne, and worthily Wed to a Prince, the first in Christendom, Your realm hath cause for high content. It stood O'er an abyss, now pierced with hopeful light: The day hath dawned so passionately longed for: To the life of God's own children we are reborn! Behold, with outstretched arms the ancient Faith Comes to your gates, asking the crowns and palms Wherewith your pious ancestors endowed her. Once more knit up her trodden robe! once more, O froward children, hear her maternal voice! Return to her beneath whose sacred mantle Salvation can alone be found. Be sure The light devolving from great Gregory Still shines from Peter's chair. Who turns from it Renounces hope. Peace ripens in its beams! Return O Shunamite! return fair Island! Appease thy terrorsâall shall be restored! The morn hath come, the works of darkness perished! Henceforth thou walkest in the light of God. QUEEN. O noble kinsman! virtuous Reginald! We thank thy zeal and shall make fitting answer To thy high mission. I have survived despair. A helpless virgin hath our Ladie favoured; And won her battle. Faith hath piloted This shattered barque at length to a happy haven. Here stand we, without question, King and Queen: And, with our Parliament, implore the Pope For reconciliation. Take this missive: It is sincere. Kneeling we crave your blessing! PHILIP. Your Eminence shall pardon my stiff kneesâ Stiff, Spanish manners. Ha! I cannot kneel. CARDINAL. With overflowing heart, I bless thee, daughterâ And bless, in thee, thy PeopleâHelp!âshe faints! QUEEN [aside]. Make no alarm. This may perchance give joy To loyal hearts. O bliss beyond expression, If God vouchsafe to crown the desolate With bloom of her own garden! CARDINAL [aside]. What means this? FAKENHAM [aside]. Vain dream of hope! more sorrows are to come. Scene VI. Palace, Whitehall. Queen, Philip, Gardiner, Pole. QUEEN. You will not go so soon? PHILIP. Why should I stay? My counsel goes for nought, backed though it be By your wise Chancellor. QUEEN. Alas! I know not In what I have denied you; save this onlyâ Recourse to death and torture: when my heart, My judgement, yea my conscience, dictates rather The force of free discussion. GARDINER. Pardon, Madam. Reason no eye-salve brings to men whose will Shuts out the truthâ QUEEN. But have you fairly tried it? PHILIP. What call you fair? If to probe truth and find it Even in men's vitals; dragging crime to light, As doth our holy office in Castile, Be justâand who so bold as to deny it?â Then is it just to use all cogent means Which shall extort confession. We rout foxes With fagot from their holes: why not unkennel With fire the vermin which infest the state? CARDINAL. Forbear, my Lord, by forced analogies To blind plain reason. Even those Puritans Are rational; and better may be won By logick, than affrighted by brute strokes. PHILIP. Your Eminence hath powers of persuasion Unknown to me. I have no time for talk. (Preserve me from all babblers!)âI love listeners. My maxim is, compel men to their good: And if they thank you notâthe fault is theirs. What say you, Chancellor? GARDINER. Your Grace speaks wisely; And shrewdly to the purpose. QUEEN. The laws of England Provide sworn juries; fellows of the accused; To hear the evidence, and give their verdict, Leaning to mercy. GARDINER. Under correction, Madam, Of judges versed in law. PHILIP. Ay, ay, my Auntâ Your Motherâsometime Queen of this good landâ This land of equal lawsâveracious juriesâ Had what you call fair trial! let me seeâ Bishop, your predecessor, Doctor Cranmer, Was the assessorâjudgeâor advocateâ (Saint Jago! what know I of your law jargon?) In that fair process: and for his fair demeanour Therein, our Queen now tenderly entreats him! It stirs my bile to hear such squeamish cries As certain damesâno babes God wotâand gallants Disguised in petticoats like dowagers, Raise at the sight of blood. QUEEN. My lord, my lord! Degrade me not; yourself, my lord, degrade not! I am unworthy as a womanânone Knows betterâbe not angry that I weepâ But ah! forget not thus I am thy wifeâ Thy Queen. PHILIP. Ha! Ha! QUEEN. King Philip, dare you make A jest of all things holy? can you wound The heart that loves you? PHILIP. Madam, I am grave. But I am not to be cajoledâwith tears; And whining posies; and dramatic rant. This hand (nay, I will hold it while I please) You gave in pledge of conjugal obedience. I condescended to advise, when right Entitled to command. The obstinate I thought to shame with raillery: but, look you, I have not sold my youthful liberty By this ill-sorted spousalâ QUEEN. Outraged! outraged! Why sought you then this spousal?â PHILIP. Why? great kingdoms May be compacted thus. My father willed itâ Sage counsellors advised. Were these not reasons? But hear ye, Queen and wife, if here my will Be not obeyed, I will not here abide; But cast you from meâthus. [Queen sinks down. CARDINAL. Now I must speak Or die!â GARDINER. Hush, hush! CARDINAL. Thou traitor to the altar! Bethink theeâmarriage is a sacrament Which to profane is deadly! Look on her Who gave thee all her wealth, her crown, her people; And, above all, her virgin heart and person; And hoped thee her true helpmate through this world, Nor in the world to come to be divided. And now you shake her from you as an aspâ Or poisonous froth shot from a rabid lip! PHILIP. Were I a basilisk I'd look thee dead! Outâvermin! CARDINAL. No! my lord. The church hath thunders: Suspended hang they o'er thy headâbeware! GARDINER. Pray you, retire. CARDINAL. Not so. My heart is strong: And like some stalwart wrestler, who hath need Of exercise, and doubts nor heart nor limb, I shrink not from the combat. He who carries His Cross, a daily burthen, well may stand In front of any giant of the ring Who boasts he can move spheres. PHILIP. My lord of Winton, Let the poor player say on. We can afford, Smiling, to look down on his petty stageâ And meditateâhis guerdon. CARDINAL. Ay: you are great Above us by your station, as the vulture Upon his mountain pinnacle. What then? The arrow makes a pathway on the air; The peasant's hands can reach the feathered tyrant, And from the vale quench his despotick eye. Sir, you have heard the truth now I have spoken. PHILIP. Once and too much. QUEEN. Ah me. [she swoons]. PHILIP. Go, call her surgeon. Remove her to her chamberâa good riddance! CARDINAL. Hard as the millstone, and as cold! King Philip! There is a book in heaven wherein the deeds Of men are graven. PHILIP. Sir, you may retireâ Surely you heard me not?âyou may retire! Begone!âit is my pleasure! CARDINAL. I depart. My place is otherwhere. Never henceforth, Transgressor, shall I meet thee, face to face, Until thy sin by penitence be absolved! [Exit. GARDINER. A pestilent hot headed fool! PHILIP. A sample Of English talking on Italian thinking. In Spain we thinkâand actânot speak. Is he A heretick? the late Pope had misgivings:â The man out-braved them. Next, at Rome they sought To make him Pope: and that he may be yet. It were not wellâ[pause] we must consider this. Pope? never! Lambeth? Ha! Gardinerâa word. Think you one may be foundâa witnessâha?â GARDINER. Trust me. PHILIP [whispers]. Like you not this Naboth's vineyard? Tush man! should Pole be Primate? Are there none Can testify of this manâso and so?â Shall Pole, I say, be Primate? GARDINER. God forbid it! PHILIP. Be sure he'll not forbid, if man allows it. See well to this. Gardiner, wert thou Archbishop, This land were cleansed anon. Look to't, I say. GARDINER. Who to great Philip's will shall answer nay? [Exeunt. Scene VII. The Queen's Closet, Whitehall. Queen, Margaret Douglas, Fakenham. QUEEN. I am lighter, gentle cousin. What hath chanced, That thus of strength and sense I lie bereft? MARGARET. Sleep onâyou need refreshment: need all powers Of your great intellect and noble courage. Sleep and awake for action. QUEEN. I am ready. Let me considerâdim, dim, dim, the visionâ And dark with heavy cloudsâbut they disperseâ Gradually, slowlyâHa! the blow comes back! If stung and stunnedâit stings again; but stuns not. Holdâlet me thinkâwhat's to be done? poor heart! Thou wilt not break! insult unmitigated! Witnessedâby him!âby Pole! O Reginald! Avenged! MARGARET. What means she? FAKENHAM. Hear, but mark not.âDaughter! QUEEN. Ay, call me thus: thy spiritual child; Humble and needing love,âalbeit a sinner. FAKENHAM. A sinner surely! who hath not sinned? but now Much sinned against. QUEEN. Feed not with idle comfort. Sin earns its shame. Feeble and worthless am I. Something hereâin my burning heart and brainâ Tells me I yet shall be all good men's loathing. O mercy, heaven! I shudder at myself. At once to love and hate, caressârevenge! Hide me, good angels! FAKENHAM. Daughter, what is this? Think not so falsely of thyself. QUEEN. Ay, Fakenham! Wouldst thou too pamper pride? O, Sir, beware! To sap the sense of shame is to make pillage Of the soul's chastity. FAKENHAM. Restrain, I pray you, This vehemence of passion, that from the height Of just resentment hurls you to despair. QUEEN. Pray for me, father. FAKENHAM. Join with me in prayer. What should avail my prayers, if yours are dumb? QUEEN. I ask but prayer: I seek no miracle. Though holy prayer availed to part the seaâ Though prayer brought manna from the fruitful cloudâ And water from the rockâand caused the sun O'er Gibeon to stand still. Such miracles I ask not; nor, entreated, would expect. But pray for me, that, even as the thief On the third cross, I may have peace in heaven. I am sinkingâsinkingâsinking! Pray, or I perish! Enter an Usher. USHER. The King, may it please your Grace. QUEEN [springing up]. The King! King Philip! O speed him hither! stay: here's for thy newsâ A jewel from my finger. Haste thee, friend! Enter Philip moodily. QUEEN. O Philip, Philip! art thou come to me! And shall there not be now an end of weeping? I was thinking of theeâwhom else think I of? I talked of theeâof whom is all my talking? But thou art here again: and my poor heart, Like a caged bird, is beating at its bars, To fly forth to the comfort of thy bosom. Speakâspeakâmy soul! and give me peace. PHILIP. How's this? Are we alone? QUEEN. No, surely: Margaret, And my good confessorâ PHILIP. I am not blind. There stand they, with wide eyes, and open ears; Eaves droppersâspies. You hear me, Sir and madam? FAKENHAM. We but await her Grace's pleasure. QUEEN. Go! Go, quickly;âgo! ah my dear lord, I saw not Aught but my husband. Am I pardoned? PHILIP. Mary! QUEEN. Blessings upon thee for that little word! PHILIP. I have pondered much of lateâI have weighedâI sayâ These differencesâworking to estrangementâ You mark me? QUEEN. Breathlessly. PHILIP. Ayâwhere was I? The estrangementâwrought by interloping priestsâ And meddling confessorsâand confidantsâ Hark ye, your confidants, or man, or woman, Are pestilentâeschew themâ QUEEN. I would wish To shape myself in all things to your wishes. PHILIP. Compliant helpmate! then we have not quarrelled? QUEEN. Ah, Philip, spare me! PHILIP. Saint Jago! hear her! Spare? have I struck thee? bared my poniard to thee? Poisoned thy cup? QUEEN [faintly smiling]. Thou art not dangerous. PHILIP. I know not thatâI must be short with you. I cannot abide your Cardinal. QUEEN. My Cardinal?â PHILIP. Well: the Pope's legate: Reginald de la Pole. Despatch him. QUEEN. My good lord? PHILIP. Ah! you mistake. Not in that senseâjust now. Yet 'twere not ill. QUEEN. I trust we still talk riddles to each other. What is your purpose? PHILIP. As to thatâbut noâ The time must ripen. What I would haveânowâ Is simply the removal of this Legate. (The Pope shall soon recall himâif all live) You must reject him from your presence: spurn him, As I this cushion. QUEEN. Wherefore do you hate him? PHILIP. Call it not hatred, but antipathy: Such as the callow chicken feels for hawks, Or wild horse for the wolf. Aversion call it: That wraps me in a cold and clammy horror When we approach. I know he cannot harm me; And have small doubt, he would not if he could. But still, my flesh creeps if I do but touch him, As when one strokes a cat's hair 'gainst the grain. If he looks grave, I straight grow cholerick; If cheerful, I abhor him; when he laughs, My vitals sicken. Odious is his garb Of ostentatious purple; jewelled hands; That beard down-streaming like the chissel'd locks Of Moses from the hand of Angelo.â QUEEN. Why what is this but hateâbrute, undiscerning: The hate that grows in too self-loving hearts? PHILIP. I thank thee, loving mistress, for that taunt. What more? QUEEN. Bear with me: my heart throbs to bursting. PHILIP. Well thenâif full confession please thee betterâ Think I do hate himâWhat say you now? QUEEN. Just heaven! To hate God's image thus, without a cause, Is to hate God; and wound him through his work. This was the sin that hurled the Archangel down From Heaven to Hell's abysses: this the sin That drave forth Cain, a branded wanderer! Let it be cleansed and shrivenâor you shall go To your account hereafter, linked with these. PHILIP. And if so, were not these the mighty Ones Of Earth and Hades? you are much too flippant. Blame you not God, blaming his instruments? And such are Kings: such Attila, God's scourge: Such he who the earlier Becket slew: such Mary, Whom after times may call the bloody Queen. QUEEN. Indeed I have done muchâmay God forgive me! Pray for me, Jane! linked with thy Dudley, pray! PHILIP. Arouse thee, woman! thou shall yet do deeds To earn that name indeed. QUEEN. What stab comes next? PHILIP. Who told thee I could stab? speak, idiot, speak! QUEEN. Believe it, I meant nothingâyou affright me. PHILIP. Then, meaning nought, speak less. Attend to me. I have directed Gardiner to impart My final, stern resolve touching these prelates; Felons heretical. They must die: or thou And I meet never more. QUEEN. I do but dreamâ It cannot beâthou canst not be so cruel. Unsay it! PHILIP. Thou canst dream; well know I thatâ I never. Would that I could learn of thee! I will not say it again; but see you do it: Orâ QUEEN. Oh be silent! let me thinkâgo not. PHILIP. Farewell! till you have thought upon this matter. QUEEN. Go not! PHILIP. When you are tractableâ QUEEN. Oh go not! PHILIP. I shall take thought on my return. Till then, Take my farewell! QUEEN. I cannot lose thee thusâ I cannot lose thee nowâmy heart is breaking! [Philip goes out. Queen sinks in a passion of grief. Scene closes. SCENE VIII. A Chamber, Whitehall Palace. Philip, apart: Enter Gardiner and Bonner. GARDINER. He's in a moody temper. How he'll chafe, Hearing my conference with her Grace! BONNER. And message. Will he bear this? and not be dangerous? His Spanish gentry tell strange tales. GARDINER. Hurt us? Tut, man! Who strikes off hands for their offenceâ Or plucks an eyeball out because it frets? PHILIP. Ha! ha! ha! ha! [He rises and walks up and down. BONNER. Why does he laugh so grimly? And rub his hands so fiercely, and pluck his beard? GARDINER. His wayâhis way. When any new conceit Of pleasurable malice takes his fancy, 'Tis ever thus. BONNER. Well: God gives instruments. We'll not complain. GARDINER [kneeling]. My liege! PHILIP [starting]. How now? how now? Why come you on me suddenly? Ho! Egmont! GARDINER. Matters of privacy, my lordâwe came Duly announced. Your pardon. PHILIP. I was musing. The feather of a pleasant phantasy Tickled me, and I laughedâdid I not laugh? GARDINER. Right joyfully methought. PHILIP. There you mistook. I never laugh for joy. My lady Queen? What said she to our message touching Pole? GARDINER. That she will not desert a faithful servant. PHILIP. Ha! ha! why see you now, I laugh again. This was foreseen. A missive for the Pope. A word aside with you. Bonner's a butcher Whom, wanting, we employ; but not consult. If the Pope prove refractory, like Queensâ Doth England hold no pet Campagna, teeming With deadly fogs? the Legate should breathe such. You comprehend. GARDINER. May heaven be merciful To sinners! Justice must be executed: Else were the throne a ball of emptiness For every knave to kick. PHILIP. You are quick-witted. I like you well. What of the heretick Bishops? GARDINER. Why there, my liege, my argument hath prospered. PHILIP. Her hand if once with blood incarnadined She'll love it as the henna dye is loved In Moorish harems. To your tasks, Sir Bishops! [Exeunt. Scene IX. Palace Court, Whitehall. Enter Underhill and Doctor Sandys. UNDERHILL. Where loitered you, my friend, when, yestereve, We held our revels on the banks of Thame? SANDYS. The grave-yard's gloom, where slaughtered Christians sleep, Was better for my purpose, and my mood, Than timeless mirth, godless festivities. O Underhill! UNDERHILL. Remember; to make sure, We must prepare the way. Elizabeth, If Mary die, is our true hope. To swell Her triumph, was to smooth her upward path. SANDYS. Whence comes this favour long delayed? UNDERHILL. 'Twas thus. You prophesied aright. Philip controls, Derides, the Queen: as this new persecution Demonstrates. Fearful tales creep through the palaceâ Of which hereafter. SANDYS. You beheld the pageant. How looked the Princessâ? say. UNDERHILL. Her royal barge Was garlanded with flowers, festooned around An awning of green satin, richly broidered With eglantine and buds of gold. The bright one Beneath this canopy reclined in state, Fairer than Cleopatra with her Roman. Her royal sister on the bowery shore Of Richmond met her, kissing her 'tween whiles; Her wan cheek flushing to a healthier glow. With hospitable care, and love, she led Elizabeth, to where, shrined in green leaves And flowers, a tent, curtained with cloth of gold, And purple samite, stood; whose folds were wrought With silver fleur de lys, and gold pomegranates. The music they so love breathed in their ears, Like amorous blandishment: and when the morn Rippled along the wave with soberer ray The Princess stept once more into her barge, And floated down the current, like a swan. SANDYS. God's blessing on her! hope of this poor land! UNDERHILL. King Philip's hateful eye loved not the scene. I marked his sidelong glance, with half-shut lids Averted, soon as marked. The Queen, at parting, Whispered, I know not what, through tearful smiles:â They seemed to say âHail heiress of my Kingdom!â And proud was she that day of her fair sister. SANDYS. When last I saw the princess she seemed worn, With watchfulness. UNDERHILL. But she hath triumphed now O'er slander. Philip too is most observantâ But that is dangerous. A noble creature Is she, in faith! the fiery spirit sparkles From her large eyes, whether in joy or anger. Her carriage stately and regardant, firm As a soldier, fearless in the midst of danger. She stood like Pallas mid the fabled Gods! SANDYS. O man with boyhood's heart! UNDERHILL. Hear me. In her Study hath wakened wisdom. She is bold In counsel, as enlightened; clear, discerning, Magnanimous, authoritative; yet ever Most gracious in demeanour. She will be The glory of her time. Softâhere comes Gardiner. Fly, Sandys, flyâeven I am perilled by him. [Exeunt. Scene X. Chamber in the Cardinal's House. Pole, solus. CARDINAL. I am sick to death of these perplexed intriguesâ Barbarous devicesâlying plots. O God! Self interest depraves all heartsâa mammon Preaching a spurious gospel; whereunto Millions bend down the knee. Their gods are gold. They worship those who give them what they crave. Their very piety is mercenary, Besieging saints for their peculiar gain. This measuring all things by one's proper greed Is the heart's penury. Utility To these is as the mother of the Gods! Enter Gardiner and Fakenham. Ayâhere comes one!âI sent for you, my lord. Daily these rash enormities augment. GARDINER. My lord, methinks that when the Queen approvesâ CARDINAL. Consents, Sir: she approves not. Caution Bonner. He is excessive in severities. These burnings must have end: I'll have it so. He doubts my power, my inclination knowing: But he shall find what power a Legate hath, If he provoke me. FAKENHAM. This is seasonable. These words shall save full two and twenty lives. GARDINER. And lose their souls, which earthly pangs might cleanse. CARDINAL. 'Tis well to give men time for penitence. The living, not the dead, most need our prayers. GARDINER. I scarcely think so. Dead, they sin no more. CARDINAL. I have not present leisure to discuss Abstruse points with your lordship. GARDINER. Pardon me, That I suggest, if other than a friend Caught what your Eminence hinted at but now, He might not deem it strictly orthodox. CARDINAL. If any dare accuse, I answer him. Good day, my lord. GARDINER. One wordâthese Hereticks Wax stout. They scoff our priestsânay call them knavesâ Hear that! CARDINAL. I doubt not there are many knaves. GARDINER. Well, well! in every house, and way side inn They do revile the sacrament. Prayer, fasting, Are not regarded: but, in lieu thereof, Unseemly riot; boastfulness, as though No honourable lords with full commission Went softly through the land to mend its manners. CARDINAL. Leave the commissioners, my lord of Winton, To patch their crazy vessels where they find them. As for the knaves you blame, put them in the stocks. Good day, my lord, again. [Exit Gardiner.] Alas! my friend, I faint beneath this burden, staggering blindly From pitfall on to pitfall. The King hates me; This Gardiner would supplant me: the Queen falters. They fire her soul, and terrify at once, Alternating, like double-weaponed Furies, The torch and snake. Alas! alas! for her! FAKENHAM. I have observed, my lord, your failing strength; And fancied it were time you left this court, In search of health renewed. It dwells not here. Elsewhere it may. CARDINAL. I seek not earthly blessings. Frail are they as the hands that can dispense them. Shall I ask health from one as sick as I? Life from mere mortals? riches from the poor? Amid a thousand evils that assail us We may find some to pity, whom to help us? Men get but windy words who crave advice: And when fools call their several Joves to aid, In place of logs he sends them hungry storks. FAKENHAM. Alas! you speak as one forespent with grief. Be roused! How many watch your eye for cheer! CARDINAL. The halcyon's nest was built of thornsâso mine: Floating on restless watersâsuch my fortunes! FAKENHAM. Nay, speak not thus. The conference approaches With the protesting Prelates. Who but you Shall justly deal by themâconvince and save them? Brace up your mind. CARDINAL. These failing limbs forbid! But I will strive. What load thus weighs me down? On me the stress of many a storm hath leaned, And rested on my steadfastness, as wind That beats in vain some granite ridge which severs The north and south; nor shakes with any blast. âI have heard of vampyre poisons, that can lull, Even asâunworthy thought! I'll not suspect. FAKENHAM. For the Queen's sake, for England's, droop not now. CARDINAL. The clouds of night droop round our fated House! Plantagenet and Tudor soon will be Unheeded names. Earth passeth from our grasp: May heaven be sure!âA sudden sunburst!âLo! God's Image in our heart is as yon orb Unto the universe; the eye of nature, Dispersing rays more eloquent than tongues; Beams that give life, as well as light: whose absence Wraps in cold shadow all that moves and breathes. At times that Image walks through spheres remote; Unobvious to the largely wandering eyeâ Then night-mare darkness sits upon the soul: Then, by its own shade mantled, waits the soul, Like some dark mourner, lonely in his house. But the harmonious hours fulfil themselves; And sunrise comes unlooked for, peak to peak Answering in spiritual radianceâThis is indeed, So palpably to meet Divinity, That hence the Pagan erred, not knowing God. âBut, my good Fakenham, I called you hither For conference, not sermons. Let us retire To my more private closet; and prepare Our thought for combat with the schismatick. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. The Queen's Closet. Queen alone. QUEEN. How great were man without his appetitesâ The sensual impulses that brand our nature! Then were we all intelligence like Angels; And the enlarged developement of mind Might grapple with eternal verities; And virtue be, once more, a primal instinct. [She takes a paper from a table. âWhy did I leave thee thereâthou basiliskâ To fascinate mine eyes?âagain I read theeâ O insult upon insult! shame on shame! What gibbeted in ballads? get thee gone! [Flings it aside. Though 'twere the last time, Philip, we must meet: And my despairing cry shall reach thee yet! [Rests her head on the table. Enter Margaret. QUEEN. Is it the King?âspeak quicklyâcomes he not? MARGARET. The Chancellor; may it please you. QUEEN. It doth not please. Yet holdâI must concentrate thoughtârecall him!â This dreaming while awake is dangerous: I must eschew it; or I shall act dreams;â Enter Gardiner. And so men think me madâAll postures tire. I'll sit me down. This chamber is too small For one long used to pace and muse. I love To talk in exerciseâcome you from the King?â Build me some gallery full of light and airâ Your purpose?âspeak! speak! speak! GARDINER [kneeling]. With your permission, A letter from the Pope, touching my lord The Cardinal. QUEEN. The Cardinal?âfly, Margaret, And call my friend. Wait till he come. [Apart.] This friendship Doth like a thoughtful builder, course by course, From a firm base upraise a superstructure That should endure through time. The fiery passion Without distinction feeds on flowers and weeds: But friendship, is select, considerate; Needs concord of the ReasonâI am watched! [Aloud.] My lord of Winton, what do you here unbidden? GARDINER. I have stated, under pardon, that I hold Despatches from his Holiness, whereinâ QUEEN. Now I remember. But the Cardinal Must be in presence. Bishops can backbiteâwelcome! Enter Cardinal. My handâno! no! it smells of blood! good Man, Thou shalt not kiss it! CARDINAL. Daughter, calm yourself: Your pleasure? Good my lord of Winton, speak: Hath any evil chanced? GARDINER [aside]. Missives from Rome; Which touch your Eminence: she knows them not. QUEEN. Speak to your errand. GARDINER. May it please your Grace, His Holiness, hereby, recalls the Legate; And summons him to answer certain charges. QUEEN. What means the Pope? Are we not Queen? Forgets he Our father? what!ârecall the Cardinal, Our cousin, counsellor; our leave unasked? GARDINER. The Cardinal Peyto shall attend your Grace, Duly deputed with legantine powers. QUEEN. Who is this Peyto?âpoor, Franciscan friar!â Legate to us in place of royal Pole? What is Pole's crime? the King he serves, and Us, And People, as becomes an Englishman. This Pope maltreats me. We have, in all things, laboured To serve the Apostolick See. What dangers Shall not this Pole's departure loose on England? It is as though you took from a sick soul Its best physician. Sir, he shall not go! CARDINAL. Some old spite rankles here. No Pope before E'er dealt with trusted Legate thus. Some charge Should be set forth, before recall. He knows not A colourable fault, or he had named it. QUEEN. You shall not goâthat's flat: nor Peyto come! Without circumlocution tell them so. Passion o' God! we'll not be trifled with! CARDINAL. My duty as a subject binds me here To your Grace's will: but to his Holiness Ecclesiastical subordination Compels me to respect his interdict, No more a legate. QUEEN. I will have no other. Let's talk of something else. Lord Chancellor, Touching this thing, remember we prohibit The promulgation of the Papal Bull. And now I do bethink me, let our Attorney Enquire how far the Papal jurisdiction Affects this realm. Methinks his Holiness Hereafter more advisedly shall use us. [Exit Gardiner and Pole. No words upon't: retire!âO Margaret! Sweet cousin, pity me! I am stung and scourged With piled indignities. Butâdid not Heâ My Saviour, meekly wear his thorny crown? Why should I murmur? MARGARET. Madam, peruse his Word: And it shall be thy comfort. QUEEN. Hush! you know not All you dare think. Beneath the soul there sleep The founts of a great Deep. Unseal them notâ Retire, fair girl: I long for silent thought. [Exit Margaret. [She paces about: then stops before a veiled picture. To thee I turn; and not the Virgin Mother! Forgive me, Heaven! thou canst not hear, O Philip, My secret sighs: blind art thou to my weeping. Yet I would kneel to thy insensate image, And plead for pity. Never, never breathed A wife more fond and faithful! PHILIP [entering.] Wherefore thus? Rise from thy grovellingâI help thee not. QUEEN. Great God of heaven! look down and judge! PHILIP. How, Madam? Do you impeach me? what is your complaint? QUEEN. Strengthen me, Thou, Almighty One! for I Am very weak and miserable. PHILIP. Well: Ere I go hence, you have besought this visit. My horse is at the gate, pawing the air; Impatient, like his master, to be gone. My sail is on the sea: fair blows the wind: Prithee, detain me not. QUEEN. If not a heart, Have you no conscience? PHILIP. For my confessor. Alphonse de Castro looks to that. QUEEN. Yet, Sir, You countenance the foreign ribaldries That offer shame to our pure manners. PHILIP. Prude! Go to! We, Southrons, know the hottest fires Smoulder beneath the mountain capped with snow. Vesuvian lava sleeps in English bosoms, Pure though they seem. QUEEN. No such retort you ventured To my chaste maiden, Lady Magdalene; Who smote you, as a Dacre knows to smite, When with licentious arm you clasped her waist. PHILIP. I warrant you an Amazon! I' faith! My error was to judge her by her name; Deeming she might have earned it. QUEEN. This to me? PHILIP. Ay, most discreet of dames! and what's to thee The carriage of your ladies? watch your own. QUEEN. I guard my ladies' honour as mine own. PHILIP. Then guard yourself. QUEEN. I stand in the open day, A Queen, a loyal wife, before all eyes. While you, Sir, rove at night, and give occasion For losel scandal. PHILIP. Ha! indeed?âwho dares Whisper of Philip to his wife? QUEEN. No whisper! See hereâa ballad jestââHow the King likes The baker's daughter in her russet gown Better than Queen Mary without her crownââ PHILIP. 'Sdeath!âI could stab the knave whoâ QUEEN. Stab this heartâ No more your pillow. I would gladly die! PHILIP. Talk you thus, Madam, with the Cardinal? QUEEN. O, Philip! I have never breathed my grief Into another ear. PHILIP. With Pole your counsels Are longâand private. QUEEN. Truestâholiest friend! PHILIP. In Spain we hold these piousâcounsellors, Ticklish companions in a lady's chamber. QUEEN. What is your drift, my lord? PHILIP. O nothingânothing! I am not jealous of you, my good Queen: Though you to me have hazarded plain words. Nay, lady, 'tis not that I trust the nature Of any woman: but I trust experience. A fast of forty years is wholesome practice! QUEEN. Begone! I must bear insultâI am helplessâ But you pollute my chaste mind with your gibes. It is enough. I know my fate. Begone! PHILIP [after regarding her for some time, scornfully]. For ever! [He turns from her suddenly and goes. QUEEN. [alone]. I submit to God's decree! Was it for this my maiden liberty Was yielded?âto be spurnedâdespisedâand still Bear on without redress? O grief! O shame! [She approaches the picture of Philip. Back, silken folds! that hide what was my joy, And is my torture! Back!âSee, I have rent youâ False, senseless idol, from thy tinselled frame. I wrench thee forthâI look on thee no more! And thusâand thusâ [She tears up the picture. I scatter thee from out The desecrated temple of my heart!â [A pause. My brain is hotâthis swoln heart chokes my throat. Yet am I better thus than self-deceived. Die, wretched Queen! O die, dishonoured wife! I pant for the cold blessing of the grave! Scene II. The Hall of Lambeth. Procession of Prelates, followed by Nobles, &amp;c. PEMBROKE. Well, Oxford, what says Cranmer? Will he bide The penalty? OXFORD. Marking his vacillation, I should say no: but ay, if well provoked. PEMBROKE. Here come theyâLatymer, the lion, first. Nor he, nor Ridley, quail: these look like martyrs. The Queen! [The Queen passes, attended. OXFORD. Good God! how changed! Speak, Underhillâ You serve beside her Grace. Is not this sudden? UNDERHILL. My lord, she is dying. OXFORD. Why her surgeons say She soon will have an heir. UNDERHILL. It is delusion. PEMBROKE. You, I believe, have served her since her childhood? UNDERHILL. I knew her when a girl: and not Jane Grey, Whom she resembled, in her prime was fairer. Then grief and passion had not stamped their hoofs On her high brow: and her acquirements answered The intellectual promise. Small of stature, Her form was symmetry; her face well shaped, With features feminine, perhaps too grave. Her penetrating eye was to be feared, Large, dark, intent. Her voice was musical; Albeit at times too piercing; her rich hair A golden brown, like sunshine on a chestnut: Her full, red lip ripe ever to pettishness. OXFORD. This is not Mary now: alas! for pity! The age she hath attained abates not beauty: But grief drives like a ploughshare thro' its garden. UNDERHILL. I sketched the features of her prime! 'Tis thus A woman should be shown to after time. OXFORD. A word with thee, good servant. Go to Hatfield: And bid the princess, by the truth forearmed, Be ready for the timeâwary of Philipâ Above all, bold. PEMBROKE. Now, wait upon the Queen. UNDERHILL. We are in charge, my lords, that none shall pass Save the Lord Chancellor and Cardinal. PEMBROKE. Peyto or Pole? OXFORD. This Peyto skulks in lanes, Like a proved knave. The Queen denies to see him. PEMBROKE. The less of Rome, the better hope for England. [Exeunt severally. Scene III. Gallery in Lambeth Palace. Queen, Pole, Gardiner, Cranmer, Ridley, Latymer. GARDINER. We but await your Grace's word. QUEEN [after a pause.] The order Of your procedure shall be grave; the manner Stringent. I shall observe you, though in pain. Should my mind wander, as 'tis apt to wander, Recall attention without ceremony. GARDINER. This is no legal process; but a test How far these obdurate men by frank confession May clear their great offence, and spare the fagot. My lord of Canterbury we cite not Till due authority from Rome shall issue. Yet let me pray him seize this precious moment For penitence. You, Latymer and Ridley, Speak: have you ought to urge? LATYMER. I am too old For controversy. I come here to die. GARDINER. With fagot at your beard this is vain glory. Your learning, Sir, is lost. Wellâturn in time; And trust her Grace's mercy. LATYMER. Hope not that. My prayer hath daily beenâmay the Queen turn! GARDINER. Oh obdurate! Hear this! QUEEN. Proceed with the others. GARDINER. What says the doctor Ridley? Thou art a man Whose subtile wit would illustrate an Arius. RIDLEY. Say on. We change not. From your coming sentence To God we make appeal. Our names, we trust, Though not of your communion, shall be found Writ in His book of life. LATYMER. I thank my God Most heartily, that He hath thus preserved me To glorify him by this kind of death. GARDINER. You see, my liege, what manner of men these be:â Unmannerly, audacious. What need we more? CARDINAL. Let the Archbishop speak. It is his right. GARDINER. Speak, Thomas Cranmer. CRANMER. First my lords, I pray you, To intercede for me, touching my sin Of treason, which with penitence I own. I am prepared to wrestle, as becomes My sacred calling in my soul's defence. Give me but patient hearing. GARDINER. That is granted. CRANMER. My lords, I doubt the law of your procedure. GARDINER. We act upon commission; which for us Is full acquittance. Hereticks despatched, Their friends may sue the law, if so it pleaseth. QUEEN. You go too fast, my lord. I halt behind Your expedite advance. Let law be law. The secular arm is nerveless till conviction At competent tribunals. See to this. RIDLEY. You keep us prisoners, deprived of service, Or free communication with our fellowsâ GARDINER. Ay? who be they? RIDLEY. Our solitude, 'tis true, Is little cheered by offices of kindness From brother scholars: but the Poor, unlettered, Have shown us sympathy. LATYMER. My soul, my soul Finds in the prison house a holy cell For meditation. 'Tis like a pitcher filled To the brim, with scripture; which so mightily Endows the spirit, that all infirmities Of flesh fall from me. I am strong through faith. CARDINAL. My lord of Canterbury, when you dispute, Observe, the parliament prohibits use Of all suspect translations of the Bible; And your own book upon the Sacraments. You must rely on writings orthodox. The Fathers such; and Scripture, as the Church Expounds. CRANMER. In chains I fight not. I deny The truth of your expounding. GARDINER. Hear, my liege! He doth deny the truth! CARDINAL. Wrest not his words. What would you say, Archbishop? CRANMER. I entreat License to utter freely all my thought. 'Tis true her Grace mislikes me, and with cause;â That Reformation is her royal province;â Yet speak I must in duty to my God. LATYMER. Why speak you not more roundly? they have scourged Our brethren with their rods; burned them with fagots; Famished and drowned; ripped up their buried bodies, And flung to dogs. 'Tis trueâthese are not lies.â Eyes have beheldâyour consciences bear witness! The blood of Abel crieth unto Godâ And at your hands shall be required! Great Queen, I supplicate you, by a mother's love, Have pity on your children, spare your people! QUEEN. Fearful old man! why thus adjur'st thou me? CRANMER. Be temperate, Latymer: this will not serve. LATYMER. Not serveâwill it avenge? QUEEN. Intemperate man! I press not thee more than I would endure. If right, you are a martyr, worthy heaven: If wrong, deserve no pity. CARDINAL. Had ye been Endowed with judgment equal to your courage, Ye had not missed the mark of genuine greatness. That little which ye lack bewrays your life. RIDLEY. We enter life as on a battle field Where principle must be asserted bravely. This shakes us notâthat God with us should deal As with his chosen Captains in old time: Nor yet repine we that our mortal state Partakes the customed penalties of man. GARDINER. You waste the time. LATYMER. He speaks as the time needs!â The Truth of God ye hide within a cave, Sealed with a seal, and guarded by a guard: But that which died shall live; and, shining wide On all the white-robed synod of the Saints, Keep, in the face of Christendom restored, Its joyful Passover! Lords, we defy you! What should we shrink from who look back on Himâ Our Masterâwhose great sacrifice began When time was as an infant, pure and tearful, And still bleeds on through every martyr's wound? He, massacred with Abel; tempest-tost With Noah; bound upon the pile with Isaak; A miracle of patience as in Job; Betrayed with Joseph; and like Daniel cast Amid the lionsâNo! we will not shrink! GARDINER. I' faith you speak bold words. Can you do boldly? RIDLEY. There have been men of fearless mind, who dared All, for their Country. Oneâthe Romanâleaped Alive into his grave, earth's yawning chasm. Shall then a Christian falter in his faith?â His faith in Him who laid heaven's crown aside To win immortal palms for those He loved? GARDINER. Palmsâpalms? for such as you? Presumptuous fools! Who scarce can boast the name of Church. RIDLEY. Our Church Is as the grape of Ephraim; better worth Than Abiezer's vintage. In her pale All wholesome comfort, honest aids are centered. The pleasures she affords are of the soul, Inward, yet shared by all; perdurable. She spreads no peacock feathers in the sun To lure the eye; nor scatters on the air Sweet odours, to entrap the sense. All blessing She knows included in the Word of God! What are the joys of sense to joys like hers, That grow for ever?â CARDINAL. This is very grievous! Madam, so please you, these be heated men, Who may not be convinced, and will not bend. With Cranmer I would crave some separate speech. [Exeunt Ridley and Latymer attended. Cranmer, my friend, you much mistake, believe me, The interest of the Church. The Church is one, And indivisible; though you have split Her walls, seceding. You should have trained with care, Not rent, the wild shoots of the immortal tree. If sand be mixed with gold, men purge the dross, But change not gold for lead. Work with us, Cranmer! Say you that things need mending? You but say What pious men within our pale say also, Albeit that task they trust not to base hands. In her own breast the Church retains the cure Of ills that vex her. Men in conference met, Learned and saintly monitors, take counsel; Whereby all points of difference are settled. Ay, men must work in concert, and the few Yield to the many, or we'll see no end. CRANMER. Your words show more the statesman than the churchman. 'Tis not the voice of Rome. CARDINAL. In that you err. The amplitude of Rome hath space reserved Where Freedom may indulge her dreams. How else Our Carmelites, Dominicans, Franciscans? We wink; they kneel: enoughâthe Church stands firm. âI can no more. We must not lose this man. Gardiner, strive thou. GARDINER. Commit to me his keeping, And I will striveâ CRANMER. To thee? Have mercy, Christ! My vineyard is too near the house of Ahab. GARDINER [aside]. Ha! Philip's word! CRANMER. O Queen! my heart is full. And I could prophesy, but I refrain. The bitter cup is brimming: it is enoughâ We both must drain our portion. Are you happy? See what has come of my prosperity! Prosperity? alas! what part hast thou In real joysâcankered prosperity? âThe conquest of our passions is true joy. Content is joy: and there's a spiritual joy In converse with our God; capacity For learning and high art; and these used rightly In aid of fellow men, and for God's glory! But there's a joy beyond; transcendent, holy; The joy when saints take up their Master's crossâ The joy of pain that testifies of faithâ Shining abroad, significant of grace, And coming glory! such as Peter found Upon his crossâStephen beneath the stonesâ Paul in his cavernâLawrence o'er the flames! âI have wanderedâpardon me! CARDINAL. We stayed to teach: And have been taught. Thanks for your sermon, Cranmer! The Queen grows pale: be quick in your retiring. Lean on my arm, my liege. Cranmer, adieu! We meet again. Would that thy faith were true! [Exeunt severally. Scene IV. Queen's Closet, Whitehall. Queen and Cardinal. CARDINAL. The silent moth gnaws not more fatally Tissue of gold, than sadness gnaws our heart. Let us apply the moral. QUEEN. Cousin, why blame Me, not my fate? CARDINAL. Fate?âIn your body dwells there An evil spirit, that your life must be A purgatory? Think you God directs 'Gainst you alone his thunders? arms 'gainst you His judgments? O what torture like self-torture! See yourself as I see you, heavy-browed, With troubled eye, and countenance aghastâ QUEEN. God made me weak and fallible. CARDINAL. Poor Soul! Be to yourself more charitable. Think That One there is who answers for your faults, And multiplies your merits. QUEEN. Hope rests there: Or I were mad. CARDINAL. All men are born to suffer. What are the consolations of the Scripture, The fruit of exhortation and of prayer, If now you quail? No, you shall quail no more. QUEEN. My web of life was woven with the nettle: My very triumphs were bedewed with tears. What now is left? CARDINAL. Religion. As the sunbow Shines in the showery gloom, and makes the cloud A shape of glory, in thy path she stands A herald of high promise. Blessed emblem! Religion bids thee hope! This gloomy life Must be amended; we must draw thee hence. QUEEN. Thanks be to God! time works while we grieve on. Deprive not sorrow of the shade she needs; The sad quiescence of desponding thought. Job also raised his voice, and wailed aloud, And so was comforted. Remember, also, In weeping I can pray: should I not? CARDINAL. Yea. Pray with thanksgiving: 'tis the sum of duty! QUEEN. Whene'er I turn my thoughts to God, one image Stands between me and heaven. Instead of prayer A sigh for Philip trembles on my lip. CARDINAL. To pine thus for the absent, as men mourn The dead, is sinful. QUEEN. Speak no more of him. Thoughts holier be my guide. You pity one Who twines her heart to the decaying creature, Yet may earn heaven. All earthly vows are light As winds; faithless as ice. I raise my eyes: There find I love enduringâever loyal! Ay, loyal; for the Saviour, through our flesh, Hath bound himself to man's community; And with immortal garlands, without thorns, Shall crown his chosen. CARDINAL. Hear me, Queen of England! Thus I preach comfort to thee. Live for thy People! Make England happy! It is a noble thing To stablish thrones on bounty; reign through love: To make the spacious heart of man our kingdom. O'er such a Prince the hand of God shakes forth Blessings like rain on the green lap of Spring. For him no stabber lurks in palace courts: His march is tranquil in the front of battle: Good luck attends his counsels. Prosperous At home, and reverenced in lands remote, All eyes wake for him, and all tongues pray for him: His life shall be a blessing to his people; And his just memory their rightful dower. QUEEN. But how make good the portraiture? alas! We cannot pace the avenue to glory, Until with blood its sacred palms are sprinkled. Our churches were baptized with martyrs' gore, Which holocausts must purge! CARDINAL. I spake not, daughter, Of glory: I besought thee to be good. The chief of greatness is surpassing goodness: And that outsoars the ken of mortal eyes; Hidden with God. Yet I would have thee glorious: Radiant with all heroic qualities; Magnanimously bent on great designs; Profuse in liberality; sedate Even in devotion; scrupulously just;â All this hath Mary been: why not so still? QUEEN. O Reginald! thou guiding, this might be. To thy pure hands I would confide the staff Now feebly held by the apostate Cranmer. CARDINAL. To speak of him I sought you. QUEEN. First decide: Will you accept this charge? CARDINAL. And Winton curse The hand that doth supplant him? QUEEN. He deserves Promotion: but not thusâ CARDINAL [musing]. He who hath stood Upon the first step of the Papal throne, And vacant left the Vatican, may look With eye undazzled on the chair of Lambeth. QUEEN. The Church requires your service: you must yield it. CARDINAL. I answer to her call, and yours. A wrong It were to both if Stephen Gardiner made The crozier but a bloody battle-axe. You must spare Cranmer. Hear me. He hath been Your mother's foeâa false friend to her rival: Therefore 'tis great to spare. But in the main, Though weak, he is good; ardent in search of truth, Though apt to wander; generous when not fearful; Clear-sighted, where self-interest blinds him not. Such men are dangerous, if desperate: We must not make him soâfor such make martyrs; And martyrdoms make error popular. QUEEN. I wish not for his death. CARDINAL. But Gardiner wills it: Ay, and will have it, if you be not watchful. Strange things are rumoured of the Council's doings While you lay sick. QUEEN. What can I do? CARDINAL. No evil, That good may follow. Openly remove The heretick prelate by prerogative; And, though most irksome, I will bear his burthen. QUEEN. I have long thought it strange that you refused The greater honour though the heavier burthen: The proffered crown of Rome. CARDINAL [after much agitation]. Look not alarmedâ [A pause. You touch the mind's immedicable wound.â O God! that I had died before I knew thee!â Pardon meâpardon me! QUEEN. We both need pardon. Let us forget the past. God strengthen us! CARDINAL. Fear not. Henceforth we gaze upon each other, As the two Cherubim upon the Ark; The living God between! QUEEN. Then take my hand. âIt will be colder soon. May God be with you! [Exeunt. Scene V. Oxford, interior of a Prison. Cranmer, Ridley, Latymer. RIDLEY. We stand upon the confines of two worlds; Which are as kingdoms in hostility. Here every passion, here all woes are banded; And from the throne of death an Anarch rules. There infinite peace, beneath the shield of faith; Angelick knowledge; immortality! At length we stoop o'er the dividing ridge, After sore labour. Fear not to descend. Our grievous perils past, all sorrows o'er. The kingdom of our God unfolds! Hosanna! LATYMER. Thank God that I have lived to see this day, And bless him from the midst of purging fires! Brother, through God's grace, we this day shall kindle, Throughout this English land, a light whereby True Faith shall shine for ever. RIDLEY. Praise to Him, Our Strength alone!âThou art reserved, dear Cranmerâ God give our Captain courage for the fight! CRANMER. My soul is sad. I need your dying prayers. Too prosperous, too dainty in my ways, I have been, for this reverse. The coming doom Shakes me, as shames a soldier of the cross. RIDLEY. Kneel, and pour forth thy fainting spirit in prayer, When we go forth. Think not of what we suffer: But gaze upon the vision of our glory, Till thou shalt long to share it. CRANMER. Not as thine Is my poor heart; but sluggish as my blood Creeps my slow mind. God shapes us wonderfully! We seem both formed alike; yet that free spirit Which sparkles in thine eyes looks dull from mine. Are we indeed slaves of our elements? RIDLEY. In truth the moral and the physical Are wondrously compacted: God's good purpose Pervading all. LATYMER. Come, brother; it is time To wean our thoughts from Earth. To prayerâto prayer! So shall our psalms rise on our flames to Heaven! Dear Cranmer take our last embrace. Be firm, And faithful to the end! [Exeunt Ridley and Latymer. CRANMER [alone]. Incarnate Spirits Of martyrdom! ye will ascend the pile As 'twere Elijah's chariot:âthis poor heart, The while with palpitating terrors torn. O cease, ye earthly tremours! Faith, support me! Surely I have not called on God aright? âAlas! alas! that, knowing well my fault, I have not strength to mend itâI will pray!â [He retires to a side oriel, kneels, rises, looks from the window. Enter Gardiner, who watches unobserved. CRANMER. O God! was it in kindness or despite They placed me here? My heart was not prepared To quit, without a pang, this fair, fair world. Look on that breadth of woodland; breezy hills; And waters that wind through, like placid thoughts. Here could I live a hermit, praising God: Forgetful of all cares;âthe carnal pomps Of Lambeth;âcourt cabals. Go forth, my soulâ And commune with the things thou lov'dst in youth. Oh! is it not a goodly thing to hold Discourse with the great forest, face to face; Near murmuring waters, with free-warbling birds, And throng of insect life that veils the porch Of the great Temple? Then our souls converse With that Intelligence diffused through all!â Who thinks of cunning stops, metals or woods, Or the trained finger, when the organ's breath Blows perfect music through capacious domes?â Our spirit commingles with the spirit of sound, Participant of all its harmonies. Thus penetrates the soul all that is good And beautiful in Nature: drawing from all The flavour and the aliment of joy. How great his goodness, sharing all perfections Among his creatures:âwisdom that proportions Each to his want! O! love HimâHe is thineâ And thou art His! His arms surroundâHis grace ProtectsâHis liberalities enrich thee!â [Loud shouting outside. I wakeâO miserable man!âbehold! Does God indeed protect thee? Hark those yellsâ Great God! that fearful death! the most abhorred! [He beats the ground. Hide me, cold stones! thou gelid Earth, ope for me! [Starts up again. I must look on itâha! it drags me forward [A sudden glare. With a wild fascinationâseeâthey gather Aroundâa ring of fiends!âO women! women! What brings ye there?âis this a sight? I'm blasted! [He reels back. The smokeâbreaks offâthe flamesâO Latymer! I am very faintâtoo much!âI cannot bear it. GARDINER. Nor need you, master Cranmer. In your ear; One little word. [Whispers. CRANMER. Avoid thee, Satan! GARDINER. Pshaw! You are to blame. Hard words shall not avail you. But I forgive. You weep away your brains. CRANMER. Gardiner, I am ashamed that you should see A Christian thus. GARDINER. Tut, man! the bravest soldier Would shake to see a brother roast alive: Especially, if waiting for his turn. Why, what a fool are you to take your turn! You will not bear it. You being head of all These hereticks, ay you they'll torture slowly. Sick fancy shudders to behold theeâblackening And withering mid the coalsâand hear thy shrieksâ And all so soon! CRANMER. When, when?â GARDINER. Perhapsâto morrow CRANMER. I cannot bear it. I'll signâanything! GARDINER. Then thisâgo to! Your hand shakes: take more time. Why men will sayâNo matter what they say, Now it is done. CRANMER. And am I safe? GARDINER. 'Tis likely CRANMER. Is it not certain? GARDINER. Only probable. But I shall be your friend. Trust not in Pole! CRANMER. Palter not with me. Why not trust in Pole? I have ever found him gentle. GARDINER. Men are mortal. CRANMER. Pole's in good healthâ GARDINER. Yet prophecies go round That he stands foremost on death's calendar. CRANMER. He shall outlive us both. GARDINER. I think not so. EnoughâIf you uphold what's here subscribed, You may be saved. CRANMER. Yet lost eternally! GARDINER. Possibly both ways, if you so speak to others. We shall seeâwe shall see! God keep you, Dr. Cranmer! [Exit. CRANMER. Oh madman! recreant! I am lost for ever! [Scene closes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. The Queen's Closet, Whitehall. Enter Queen and Cardinal. CARDINAL. I tell you this is wrong; your course is wicked. Ay, wickedâI must speak. O Mary! shrink not. This duty, trust me, is an agony. QUEEN. Go on, my lord. CARDINAL. Rogers died first: what then? Keener Fanaticism from his ashes Sprang up, a new-born PhÅnix. Hooper, Ridley, The venerable Latymer; now Cranmerâ You kindle fires to torture dying men: These fires are lighting living hearts. QUEEN. What mean you? Think you I love to kill? It isâIt isâ A terrible duty! Pole, I cannot sleep: Yet dreams are not more hideous than my thoughts. CARDINAL. Sometimes I hope you know not what fiends do, Armed with your name. QUEEN. I know the men you named Died, obstinate in crime. CARDINAL. The men I named! The poor, by thousands, perish in your flames! QUEEN. The poor! the ignorant! I slay not these. CARDINAL. Yet these die daily. QUEEN. Would that I were dead! The faculty of power slips from my grasp: And I remain the servile tool of wrong. Would I were dead!âIt will soon beâWhat means this? Enter Gardiner. My lord of Winton. Does the Council doom Our people without warrant from ourself? GARDINER. None but the obdurate in heresy. For this we have our warrant: and no less Will satisfy the Church. To stem the course Of justice, Madam, trust me, shall endanger Your precious soul:ânor would it now avail. The Holy See in this hath masterdom. QUEEN. Mean you to menace? GARDINER. God forbid! But one Sits on the Roman throne who knows its rights. QUEEN. Rights? GARDINER. Interdict and excommunication. CARDINAL. Trust me, my lord, the people will not bear These dire severities. GARDINER. We'll look to that. The people?âever preaching of the people! My lord, if they but budge, we'll ride them down. CARDINAL. I shame to hear you. GARDINER. Wherefore? CARDINAL. They are men! What fills your treasury? The people's hands; Which labour at the loom, the plough, the helm. What nerves your power? The thews of common men. Ye can transmute the peasant's blood to gold: Refine his sweat to silken sheen and gems. What then to you is basis of all gain? The poor serf's heart, who smiles amid his labours, And kisses every hand that spreads his dole;â Yet, roused by wrong, in blindness of his strength, Can pull the pillars of your temples down In righteous ruin. QUEEN. Pole, thou speakest well. GARDINER. Under your leave, my liege, his Eminence Speaks scholarly, not practically, well. Wise sayings are the playthings of the wise. As abstract propositions, in their closets, Men sport with maxims which, in act, would peril Their heads, and shake down kingdoms. QUEEN. Let this cease. You named but now the Archbishop. He is safe In recantation. GARDINER. He retracts the same. CARDINAL. Not so. Renewed persuasion binds him faster. GARDINER. I say the recreant shall retract once more, When urged by hope, not fear. CARDINAL. A weak, good man. GARDINER. 'Twere well to test this instability. Therefore, upon the ground of his backsliding, He shall be thoroughly probed. QUEEN. No torture, Sir! GARDINER. Noneâsurely noneâsave torture of the mind. CARDINAL. Your meaning? GARDINER. Simply thus. He hath relapsed: And therefore merits death. With due permission, I purpose to prepare him for the stake: The fear whereof will madden him. We, then, May hintâthat if he shall profess repentance, From the high pulpit of Saint Mary's church, The doom he hath incurred may be remitted. Their leader's palinode shall scandalize His faction sorely. What says my lord to this? CARDINAL. You study the sage Florentine. Your scheme Is worthy Macchiavelli, and his âTyrant.â GARDINER. The scholar will break out! You better suit The cloister than the court. Time presses, Madam. CARDINAL. Madam, you speak not. Then 'tis time I go. QUEEN. Desert me not. CARDINAL. Desert not thou thyself. I have once spoken plainlyâtwice to speak Is once too often, when we speak in vain. [Exit Cardinal. GARDINER. Now think, and act, as shall become a Queen; Enervated no more by this man's folly! QUEEN. Presume not thou to slur the Cardinal. GARDINER. My liege, the time hath come when duty forces Words from my lips which may affect my life. Slay me, but hear me first: hear the King's voiceâ The word a husband speaks; who will renounce you, (In this I speak commissioned) if unheeded: The word the Church, through me, her minister, Pronounces; which can excommunicate (I speak commissioned) all who disobey: The word our venerable law declares, Saying, the Sovereign who abandons duty (I speak commissioned still) forfeits the rights Accorded to her by her subjects' oaths; Then when her oath gave pledge reciprocal. [He kneels. You are moved! O blame me not or strike me deadâ The death were welcome that might win you back To the right path, whence if you now depart You perish. QUEEN [much agitated]. I will do what you judge best. GARDINER. Nay what the Council judgeâthen you are safe. [Exeunt. Scene II. Hatfield House. Enter Elizabeth, Winchester, Pembroke, Oxford. ELIZABETH. A curse is on this kingdom! Each new day Comes with the stamp of blood upon its forehead. And though pale faces lurk 'neath smiling masks, The hot heart palpitates for retribution. My sister's miseries are manifest: Yet still the royal monster who deserts her Rules through his myrmidons. In vain doth Pole His nobler counsels urge. WINCHESTER. Our hope lay thereâ In our great enemyâ'tis marvellous How little Pole's commanding mind and will Avail this day for England. OXFORD. He is cramped. Within the jealous precinct of a court Large energies like his lack room to move. Pole cannot act with others. Men like him Bear sway alone; or lie like stranded ship, That hears the clarion of the seaward wind, And waves no pennon. ELIZABETH. His ambition dead, (For he has touched the summit and foregone it) He fights with the left hand; and from his work His heart is absent. WINCHESTER. Also his body fails him. ELIZABETH. The silver voice of Fakenham pleads in vain. Philip commands; Bonner inveighs; at hand Is wily Gardiner's whisper. Shall we wonder If thus assailed, sapped, stung, her sick heart yields? PEMBROKE. We wonder not; butâlet the word be spokenâ Shall we submit? WINCHESTER. Ridley and Latymer Have perished: Cranmer, ere another day, Dies too. Speak Madam! Shall the plague be stayed? ELIZABETH. I scarcely understand your aim, my lords:â Perhaps I misconceive. What would you have? PEMBROKE. Elizabeth for Queen! OXFORD. You go too far. I would to God her Highness ruled through lawâ Not in despite of law. The Queen's distraught. I claimed my right, an audience, hoping little, Yet strenuous. Alas! what found I there? Eyes wandering, thoughts perplexed, a broken voiceâ The tower of mind down toppling to its earth! She is half deadâ WINCHESTER. Without sign manual No convict dies. OXFORD. What knows she what she signs? Parchments throng roundâtime pressesâGardiner fretsâ With aching brain she strives to read; then sighs, And wipes her eyes; and signs. God pardon her! Her faculties are torpid. She will lie Speechless as one that's dead: then wake with cries, Her temples swollen with inward pain, teeth gnashing, Her pale lips flecked with foam. WINCHESTER. God pity her! OXFORD. She dreamed to be the giver of new life: But breeds disease, whose issue must be death. WINCHESTER. Is not this persecution a plain fact? OXFORD. Oh those incarnate devils, Gardiner and Bonner! Flesh bred in murder! Blame those fiends, not her. And blame your parliament with purse agape For Noaille's gold; and ears for Renard's guile! I say the Queen's distraught; she cannot governâ A regency cures that. PEMBROKE. I love straight ways: Bye paths mislead. Had Richmond grasped at Bosworth Less than a crown, Richard had won the day. ELIZABETH. My lords, I pray you cease. I have ever found The Queen exceeding kind. She spared me once; When foes maligned me. I will not supplant her:â Nor, were I so disposed, doth the time suit. That time too swiftly comes;âbut heralded By death. Be patient. WINCHESTER. Cranmer loved your Mother. ELIZABETH. Where was his aid in her extremity? Weak pilot, veering with each shift of wind! Think you he will recant again? OXFORD. Not now. ELIZABETH. Then is he doomed. Christ succour his frail flesh! How can I save a self-abandoned man? No man is safe. All are hemmed in by spies. Men watch while we talk here. Farewell, my lords. [Exeunt. Scene III. Oxford, the Queen's Chamber. Enter, to her, Gardiner. QUEEN. Why stand'st thou gasping thus? GARDINER. Scarce can I speak. I am well nigh choked with anger and amaze. This smooth, fair-spoken, lying, cringing Cranmer Hath turned upon us, like a boar at bay! Ay, of a truth, he bared his tusks on us, In such a sort, these gray hairs stood on end. QUEEN. Dares he to tempt usâperil his soul's safetyâ Even in the doomster's grasp? GARDINER. Let me take breath! Heart-sick and brain-sick am IâMiscreant! traitor!â We led the arch heretick to Mary's church; Trusting that there he would abjure his sin; And so improve short respite to full pardon. The ânunc dimittisâ sung, we let him mount The step beneath the pulpit; where he knelt, And wept so piteously, that many, trust me, Shed tears in sympathy; specially those Who felt most hopeful in his late conversion. But scarce had Doctor Cole his worthy sermon Concluded, in the which he set forth stoutly The heresies of this blind man; expounding How men are tempted, not beyond endurance; And that his hope, even like the penitent thief Might mount to Paradise; with many more Like comfortable chargesâthis, concluded, Cranmer arose, with tearful eyes to heaven. Our hopes stood tiptoe: but, this mumming ended, Did he profess the truth? Not so!âQuoth he, âThe time hath passed that I should more dissemble.â And then he swore his conscience pricked him most For his feigned recantation, to save life: And that the hand which signed should burn the first. Then did he ban the Pope:âWe stood aghast! QUEEN. Now, by the God that made me!âbut, go on. GARDINER. We bade him be a Christian, and submit. But momently he grew more contumacious: Until, our patience gone, we packed him off Unto the stocks. QUEEN. Inveigh against the Pope? Revile our holy Church?âincite the People?â GARDINER. We wait your pleasure. QUEEN. Let him die the death! GARDINER. Suspense is torture. He must die! The stateâ God's holy Churchâyour oath to both demand it. QUEEN. Spurned as a rabid dogâshunned as a leperâ Let his foul ashes scatter on the wind! So be the violated Faith avenged: Away! away! I pant for thy return! [Exeunt severally. Scene IV. A Street in Oxford. Enter Winchester, Oxford, and Pembroke. PEMBROKE. The Princess fails us: let us try the People, Or he is lost. WINCHESTER. Consistency, forsooth! Stand up to death!âall for a nameâa shadow! A martyr truly! Better live a saint! To die untimely shall not profit him, Nor his disciples. Let him live; that so Hereafter he may preach. OXFORD. What matters itâ Or soon or late? Our mission here is closed, Duty fulfilled: and when this world fades from us The better dawns. Scandal too much hath fallen Upon the Church by his backsliding once. Be firm, O Cranmer, to the end! WINCHESTER. I grant you, The trouble of the time requires calm courses. PEMBROKE. Calm courses! Have I challenged on his path That bear, Northumberland, to quail at curs? WINCHESTER. You knew your man, and weighed the times: that bear Fell in your pitâsorely we smote him in itâ Marry I spared not! OXFORD. I had no part therein. I scorned the vermin, and withheld from Court. But to the matter. Count not on the people: 'Tis manifest they side with the old Church. To strike with half a weaponâcharge unbackedâ Were but scant wisdom. WINCHESTER. We must bide our time. PEMBROKE. Farewell, my lords!âSo be it!âSink, good sword In Isis fathoms fiveâI need you not! [Exit, flinging away his sword. WINCHESTER. We have chafed our noble friend a whit too sharply. OXFORD. Give the hot horse the reinâhe'll stop when breathless. But what avails complaint. 'Tis time we part. WINCHESTER. Oxford, farewell! Heaven bless thy noble heart. [Exeunt severally. Scene V. Oxford. A Gallery. Queen, alone. QUEEN. Why comes not Gardiner?âthis is horrible. He tempted me, he terrified, he goaded;â The homicide I fiated is doingâ And like the victim I stand shivering here, In the mind's ague. Hark! was not that a cry? What do I watch?âInexorable minutes, How swift ye speed!âtoo lateâtoo late to save! O mad precipitation of my will! Even while I speak, the future grows the past! [Shouting heard. The shout of thousands, from the scene of death Murmuring hoarselyâwhat is doing now? Enter Gardiner [staggering feebly]. You come at lastâI have waited longâspeakâspeak! Hushâthat dread sound again! My temples burn Hot as the martyr's pile. 'Tis doingâBishop! The deed you longed forâwhy not look on it With your red, hungry eyes? The man you hate Even now consumes in his great agony. O Cranmer! See him, as I see him nowâ His arms flung forth, thusâthus: the tongues of flame Eating into him like MegÃ¦ra's vipers! The agony of hell is in that cry! It hath gone up before the Son of God Appealing; ayâand we must answer it. Well may you tremble, prelate! Ho! some light! A preternatural shadow falls upon us. I shall grow madâwhy speak you not, pale wretch? GARDINER. Pardon! My voice sticks in my throat. In truth I am very feebleâsick almost to death. QUEEN. Light! light! what means this darkness? Hark! the voice Of God in thunder! who hath seen before A cloud like that o'ercast the evening sky? Black as a pallâit growsâit hovers o'er usâ A demon's wing, dun with the soot of hell! Come hitherânay, you shall comeâmark yon glare! It is not lightningâit abides: not lightning, It growsâlook on itâpriest of peace! look on it! Know you what that betides? I charge you, speak. GARDINER. I can endure no more! [He rushes out. Enter Fakenham. QUEEN. Welcome, good Fakenham! Speak, I conjure you! let me hear some voice! FAKENHAM. What can I say?âThought sickensâ QUEEN. While you pause Fancy is busyâanything but silence! I am nerved to hear the worst. FAKENHAM. What shall I say? His deathâthat white-haired manâhad graced a martyr? QUEEN. What did he doâwhat say? FAKENHAM. He never shrank From tormentânay, ere the flame reached his body, He stretched his hand forth to it, and there held itâ A black and shrivel'd shapeâpah! I am sick!â Saying, âWeak member! thou hast wrought my sin; Perish thou first!â QUEEN. I think my senses fail: What moreâwhat more? FAKENHAM. He never breathed a groan; But bowed his head amid the flames and died. QUEEN. A martyr! ha! ha! martyrâsaid you not? FAKENHAM. His death became the saints of better days. Enter Margaret Douglas. MARGARET. O my sweet mistress! QUEEN. What new stroke of horror Falls on us now? MARGARET. Scarce had my lord of Winton Reached his own house, where friends had come to feast, Sudden, as though by lightning, he fell dead. QUEEN. Support me, I am giddy! FAKENHAM. Hold her upâ Dead! Gardiner dead! He hath been sick of late. Yet it is strange. Watch our sad mistress well. [Exeunt Queen and Margaret. Ayâstrangeâboth die: bothâvictim, and oppressorâ At the same moment die: and die unshriven. Be masses sung!âlet prayer unceasingly Rise to the throne of God!âMediate, good Saints! Two grievous sinners sleep: may both awake To mercy! Which needs most?âI am sore disturbed. [Exit. Scene VI. Richmond Place, Queen's Chamber. Queen asleep on a couch, with Margaret Douglas near her. Enter Cardinal and Oxford. CARDINAL. I fear I task your friendly aid, my lord; This fever eats into my bones: I move Feebly and painfully. OXFORD. Your Eminence Is not so stricken as our mistress yonder. I do begin to fear her end is nigh. CARDINAL. Our birth is the beginning of our dying! It matters little when the end shall be. OXFORD. Much to our woful country. Heaven avert it! CARDINAL. To suit one creature, universal laws Are not revoked. Swift be thy homeward voyage, O Mary, to the haven of thy rest! The providential current, followed out, Will lead thee onward to the pleasant sea; From cataract and rock devolving smoothly To the great symbol of eternity; Which, seeming to dispart, links all together. OXFORD. Think you, my lord, King Philip will come back? CARDINAL. I fear me not. OXFORD. Nor guess a cause? CARDINAL. 'Tis clear He loves her not. Alas! he knows her not, Thus thralled, thus masked, in premature decay, Sprung from unworthy slight, care, grief, remorse. OXFORD. He may be jealous. CARDINAL. No! he does not love! OXFORD. His natural condition is distrust: His ear needs but some venemous tongue to sting it, And he shall be as dangerous as the abyss, Whose smoke makes dark the sun! CARDINAL. Alas! alas! Behold the end. Here lies a great heart blasted! [He kneels at the couch and kisses the Queen's hand. QUEEN. The CardinalâO joy!âHow sweet to waken Toward a loved face with a smile! Whence come you? Why look you sad? CARDINAL. I came to lighten sorrow. QUEEN. Is the King well? CARDINAL. The King is well, but comes not. QUEEN. Oh me! when I look back on what I have been; The strange vicissitudes that marked my way; I shudder for the future. I have been As one who saw some vision in the air Of elemental beauty, which, when grasped at, Vanished: and left instead a grinning devil. Too late I find how far from good I've wandered. Oh! never may you feel the agony Which weighs a heart down that hath earned despair. You stare at me as one of sense deprived, Or a sleep-walker crouching o'er a gulf. I am no maniac, Pole, but very wretched. CARDINAL. Why will you judge the worst? prognosticate Nought but disaster? This is no regal spirit! It is to be a dastard to complain. QUEEN. There was a timeâO Reginald! our youth Was not bound down by frosty forms: pray with me! Pray for me!âpray for hope! CARDINAL. There was a time When all your thoughts were to this heart laid open: And then to comfort your's was joy to mine. Methought God gave you, as I prayed for youâ Now graver state, stern duties interpose; And reverence chains down favour. QUEEN. God! thou knowest What, under better guidance, I had been. Marvels perplex; torments, despised while suffered, Master the spirit; blind forebodings mock us: And, though the eye marks not, the inner soul, Trembling, responds to outward influences. Therefore I deem this shadow on my mind The skirts of that dark pall which swathes my fortunes. CARDINAL. This from a Christian? Enter Lord Wentworth, Governor of Calais. QUEEN. Hold! if I read aright A face of woe, this justifies my fear, Why come you, Wentworth, from your precious charge? WENTWORTH. Woe's me! my charge is lost. Calais hath yielded. QUEEN. What manâart mad? unsay thy tidings, traitor! Calais, the brightest gem of Harry's crown! Our badge on France's capâour sallyport To his rich manors! O dishonoured Queen! Talk not to me of patienceâspeak of vengeance, Or I shall madden. WENTWORTH. Hear a little further. The King hath triumphed nobly at Saint Quentin. The Spanish infantry there pushed the French From a fair field; and took their Constable, The famous Montmorency, and the Rhinegrave, Montpensier, Longueville and Gonzaga; Leaving the son of Bourbon, duke of Enghien, Young Roche du Maine, and others, men of note, Dead on the field. QUEEN. And this, Sir, you call comfort: That Spanish swords are flushed with victory While our's are doomed to rust, our banners drooping, In the aisles of Notre Dame. O shame! where sleep The destriers that swept the field of Spurs! Degenerate daughter, thou should'st have died and left The sceptre to a manâMore griefâmore shame? Enter Lord Paget. PAGET. My liege, scarce had the late King's counterfeit Been captured, when another knave sprang up, Assuming the false name of Exeter: Who straight made proclamation, by the style Of the seventh Edward: daring audaciously Therein to call your royal sister Queen, And his affianced wife. QUEEN. O heavy day! The old wound bleeds afresh. Spare me, good God! PAGET. How will's your Grace to deal with these? QUEEN. Who knows not The punishment of traitors? Smite their necksâ As they have smit this heart! Not for myselfâ Not for myself, thou knowest O God, I strikeâ But for my country, bleeding through my wounds! Enter Lord Howard of Effingham. I see disaster couched within thine eye. Speak onâspeak out. LORD HOWARD. The Scot hath passed the border, In swarms, devastating our lands, defiling Our household honour; slaughtering our babes! MARY [springing up]. Bring forth my chariot, and my battle horses! Princes should head their armies, and partake The peril they provoke. The cry of war Renerves my vigour. From my couch of pain See, I have leaped, and flung my staff away, Even as the cripple at the voice of Christ! CARDINAL. He is a God of peace. Link not his name With thoughts of strife. QUEEN. God is the God of battles! And rides forth in the vanward of His chosen. Marvels he wrought in the old time by the hands Of his anointed. Bring my regal helmâ And panoply of mail: and redcross shield. I will go forth like Miriam, and hymn The triumph of the Lord before His people! Down-trampled Treason in the mire shall writhe Like a crushed adder. We shall spurn the Scots; And lash the hounds of France back to their kennelâ To horseâI cry aloud! OXFORD [aside]. Obstruct her not. This passion must have way. Already, mark you, Her power collapses. CARDINAL. Fearful 'tis to witness This conflict of fierce wrath with corporal weaknessâ Thus devils rebuked, rend, ere they leave, their victims. QUEEN. I am very faint. Bring me a cup of water. Time wasâbut it is gone: Time isâswift passing: Time comesâbut no reality for me! I have reignedâI am lost! Let me die! CARDINAL. Break notâbreak not our heartsâBetter the rage That nerved you at the first. QUEEN. Dear Reginald! We both are bound for death: which first I know not. I shall not see the end: but what that end I know. The spirit of prophecy is o'er me. Cloud after cloud, great woes come frowning on: A nation's wreckâthe bloody death of Kings. Call not, O Reginald, this mood despair. That I have done with earth, and sigh for peace, Need waken no man's wonder. Not diseaseâ Hearts of good cheer might conquer thatâbut grief, Remorse, shame, strike me with stern gauntlets down: While daily cares, petty anxieties, Fret me to madness. CARDINAL. Great of soul wert thou, And strong of heart, till now. Be so again. QUEEN. The strength of England, in my heart till now Concentred, melting, leaves me but myselfâ Sum up my personal life. You knew me first, A daughter, witness of her mother's wrongsâ A daughter, conscious of her father's crimesâ A princess, shorn of her inheritanceâ A lady, taunted with foul bastardyâ A sister, from her brother's heart estrangedâ A sister, by a sister's hand betrayedâ A rightful queen, hemmed by usurping bandsâ A reigning queen, baited by slaves she sparedâ A maid betrothed, stung by the love she trustedâ A wedded wife, spurned from the hand that won herâ A Christian, reeking with the blood of martyrsâ And now, at length, a hated tyrant, dragging Her People to unprofitable wars; And from her feeble hold basely resigning The trophy of long centuries of fame. I have reignedâI am lostâlet me die! CARDINAL. Is Calais worth these pangs? Ineptitude Hath lost what valour shall regain. QUEEN. 'Tis gone!â For ever!âEngland's heritage of gloryâ When shall her banner wave in France again? CARDINAL. When France outstrips her in the race of crime. QUEEN. Prophetick be thy words! But I shall lie Forgotten in my grave ere thenâForgotten? Forgotten! no! Shame's never dying echoes Shall keep the memory of the bloody Mary Alive in England. Vampyre calumny Shall prey on my remains. My name shall last To fright the children of the race I love. CARDINAL. Daughter, you err; forgetting in this passion The justice of your Maker. QUEEN. Humbly I own it: Impugning not the ways of Providence Because I suffer. Justly the penalty Of sin is meted to me. CARDINAL. With that thought Consent to peace were easy. QUEEN. Peace? no peace Till Calais be regained. No peace! my Peopleâ All England shouts upon my dying ear. No peaceâno peaceâtill Calais be won back! CARDINAL. Peace is God's gift. QUEEN. Calais! thy name is graven Upon my heartâYou'll find it when I die! [Exeunt. Scene VII. St. James's Palace, Queen's Chamber. Queen, Margaret Douglas, Fakenham. QUEEN. When shall my foot have rest? You led me first To Hampton Court from Richmond: then you said The banks of Thame were marshy; and with pain I have crept hither to St James's towers. Holy the name! 'Twere well should I die here. Why comes not the lord Cardinal? FAKENHAM. Too weak He is to move. Slow fever racks his limbs. QUEEN. Our fates are strangely linked. We'll die together. I have so dreamed before. Have you no news? MARGARET. Yes, madam, heavy news. The Emperorâ QUEEN. Is dead? I know it ere you answer. Blest Is he to be released from worldly cares, And public calumny; his dying ears Soothed by the prayers of saintly men; his limbs By holy hands composed!âWho is it that comes? Enter Count de Feria. I see not plainly. MARGARET. Count de Feria. COUNT [kneeling]. I seek your Grace with missives from the King. QUEEN. Will he not come to soothe a dying woman? COUNT. Pressing emergencies of state constrain him. He prays your Grace to wear this jewelled ring, In pledge of amity: and bids you live In cheerful hope of bodily amendment. QUEEN. I shall not trouble him long. There is no hope. COUNT. And if there be no hopeâwhich God forefend!â He owns the Princess as your proper heir. QUEEN. This gives me joy unlooked for. Tell him, good Feria, I pledge him as he hopes for God's reward, That he, when I am gone, unto my People Shall prove himself a father in his care; A brother in his love: and, furthermore, In his great power a frank and ready friend Unto my heir. Take this, a precious diamond, His father's giftâand this, his own dear pledgeâ These bid him keepâin memory of the Dead. It pleased not God that I should leave behind me A pledge of my affectionâI am choked With strange emotionsâI must speak no more Of thisânor PhilipâPardon my wanderings!â O Virgin Mother! intercede for one Whose thoughtsâthus on the threshold of thy gloryâ Still earthward turnâ FAKENHAM. You are exhausted, daughter. Haply you might have sleep, if we retired. QUEEN. The last sleep comes! Call in my gentlewomenâ Let no strange hand profane my poor remains. O heavy eyes! O fluttering heart! the hour Is come that wafts you to eternity! Where are you, Fakenham? Go notâ FAKENHAM. I am here. QUEEN. I thought you gone, not seeing well. Some cordialâ For somewhat I have still to say. Where are you? MARGARET. We are, and shall be, near you. QUEEN. Give me your handâ Why not my sister's hand? Ah, poor Jane Grey! She was to Edward, while he died, a sister. I am a sinful creatureâbless you, sister! âI would have speech with Pembroke. MARGARET. He is gone To Hatfield. QUEEN. Winchester? FAKENHAM. He, too, is gone. QUEEN. Deserted on my deathbed!âYet not soâ Dear friends, how many of ye still cling round me! I am content. In truth, the agony Is not what I had fearedâWhy this is nothing. Be satisfiedâI do not fear to die: And, to say truth, have long time wished to die. The mist that brooded o'er the face of things Is lifted. Death is sent to make us sane. âBear to my cousin Poleâfriend of my youthâ My last, last blessing. If he live, I charge him To watch my sister with exceeding love. If he be bound for heaven, his orisons Shall plead for her he lovedâtoo wellâtoo sadlyâ Before the all-seeing Judge. Take these, my jewelsâ And that best gift of earth, a deathbed blessing, Unto my sister. Not to strongly rule This kingdom, (for I know, and fully trust Her noble intellect) but fondly rule it, Leaving the issue of her cares with God, I supplicate, and warn her. For religion, I know she is no Puritan; yet fear She stumbles in her faith. At least, I pray her, To be to others, as I was to her, Indulgent. Let my debts be justly paidâ And from my goods endow an hospital For worn out soldiers. Re-endow three convents For the Observants, and, at Schene and Sion, For charitable watching of the Poor. No moreâmy breath comes painfullyâdull sounds Murmur aroundâBury me with my Motherâ Raise tombs of honourâto our memoryâ And grave on mineâthe motto I have lovedâ Prophetickâmay it proveâTime unveils Truth! FAKENHAM. Her last words!âher lips quiverâher eyes closeâ Hold up the cross! she seesâsheâsmilesâshe dies! [The Queen dies. Enter Oxford and Underhill. FAKENHAM. Too late you come, my lordâall that remains Of Mary Tudor sleeps till the last trumpet! How fares the Cardinal? OXFORD. He too is gone. Some one brought rumour that the Queen was dyingâ Whereat he suddenly grew pale; then smiled; And cried, in act of death, âReceive my soul!â Together we will rise to our Redeemer!â FAKENHAM. So, at our need, hath perished our last hope! For first in worth, as place, was he in council; And knew so well the interests of the State Were with God's law entwined, that he became Restorer of Religion; and made perfect The shattered superstructure of the realm. âWhat birth, outside the purple, was so glorious As his, whose sire and mother both derived Their lineage from the throne? The Church's champion, He of her sons was the most moderate. His learning was profound; his heart all bounty. From youth he shunned the world. The privacy Of rural life, pure air, the quiet stars, Enamel'd meadows, breath of woods and streamsâ At these, the breasts of Nature, he imbibed Devotionâand so nursed his soul for heaven. He travelled through that land whose names are story; Beheld Rome's wonders; spiritually tasting The intellectual flavour of an age Whose noblest were his mates in after time. When Harry probed him touching the divorce, He lashed the royal vice, and woke its fury: But God was his protection. Long he lived A voluntary exile; watchful, studious. Behold him next, a Cardinal, at Trent, Presiding o'er the Council: then at Rome, Refusing the great Christian bishoprick: At Mentz, once more, a mild recluse; his soul To letters, which he loved, and pious needs, Devoted: and at last, recalled to England; Restorer of the Cross! OXFORD. Amid the torrent Of manifold opinions stood the Queen; A rock, whose firm-fixed base defied all floods. God set her on the throne of his own tower: And, in his mercy, sent this Cardinal To strengthen and to guide her. FAKENHAM. His was not The tactique of the soldier: he advanced His counsel with persuasion; ever suing The royal heart for merciful awards; While sterner men, or weaker, frowned or wavered. OXFORD. We have beheld these lightsâbut not preserved them; Now quenched for ever! FAKENHAM. England! my poor country! Soiled with impiety, and blood of martyrs; Shall Henry's sin never be expiated? Shall his blind passions through our pangs be punished? His blasphemies entail persistent error? The limit and far scope of evil deeds God metes alone, who metes their punishment. Man has but to revere while he submits! OXFORD. If ever victim to a broken heart Hath died, she lies before us. Awful Queen! Hardly of thee Posterity shall judgeâ For they shall measure theeâ UNDERHILL. Let me speak, Sir; For I have known, and been protected by her, When fierce men thirsted for my blood. I say not That she was innocent of grave offence; Nor aught done in her name extenuate. But I insist upon her maiden mercies, In proof that cruelty was not her nature. She abrogated the tyrannic laws Made by her father. She restored her subjects To personal liberty; to judge and jury; Inculcating impartiality. Good laws, made or revived, attest her fitness Like Deborah to judge. She loved the Poor: And fed the destitute: and they loved her. A worthy Queen she had been, if as little Of cruelty had been done under her, As by her. To equivocate she hated: And was just what she seemed. In fine she was In all things excellent while she pursued Her own free inclination without fear! [The curtain falls.</field>
