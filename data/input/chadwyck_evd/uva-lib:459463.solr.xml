      <field name="fulltext">The honor, and splendor of these spectacles was such in the performance, as could those houres haue lasted, this of mine, now, had been a most vnprofitable worke. But (when it is the fate, euen of the greatest, and most absolute births, to need, and borrow a life of posteritie) little had beene done to the studie of magnificence in these, if presently with the rage of the people, who (as a part of greatnesse) are priuiledged by custome, to deface their carkasses, the spirits had also perished. In dutie, therefore, to that Maiestie, who gaue them their authoritie, and grace; and, no lesse then the most royall of predecessors, deserues eminent celebration for these solemnities: I adde this later hand, to redeeme them as well from Ignorance, as Enuie, two common euills, the one of censure, the other of obliuion.

This Some take it to be the same with Nilus, which is by Lucan called Melas, signifying Niger. Howsoeuer, Plinie, in the place aboue noted, hath this: Nigri fluuio cadem natura, quæ Nilo, calamum, papyrum, &amp; casdem gignit animantes. See Solin. aboue mentioned. riuer taketh spring out of a certaine lake, east-ward; and after a long race, falleth into the westerne Ocean. Hence (because it was her Maiesties will, to haue them Black-mores at first) the inuention was deriued by me, and presented thus. First, for the Scene, was drawne a Landtschap, consisting of small woods, and here and there a void place fill'd with huntings; which falling, an artificiall sea was seene to shoote forth, as if it flowed to the land, raysed with waues, which seemed to moue, and in some places the billow to breake, as imitating that orderly disorder, which is common in nature. In front of this sea were placed sixe The forme of these Tritons, with their trumpets, you may read liuely describ'd, in Ouid. Metamor. l.1. Cæruleum Tritona vocat, &amp;c. and in Virgil. Æneid. l.10. Hunc vehit immanis Triton. &amp; sequent. Tritons, in mouing, and sprightly actions, their vpper parts humane, saue that their haires were blue, as partaking of the sea-colour: their desinent parts, fish, mounted aboue their heads, and all varied in disposition. From their backs were borne out certaine light pieces of taffata, as if carryed by the winde, and their musique made out of wreathed shells. Behind these, a paire of Sea-maides, for song, were as conspicuously seated; betweene which, two great Sea-horses (as bigge as the life) put forth themselues; the one mounting aloft, and writhing his head from the other, which seemed to sinke forwards, so intended for variation, and that the figure behind, might come off better: Lucian. in ?????. ?????. presents Nilus so. Equo fluuiatili insidentem. And Statius Neptune, in Theb. vpon their backs, Oceanvs and Niger were aduanced. Oceanvs, presented in a humane forme, the colour of his flesh, blue; and shaddowed with a robe of sea-greene; his head grey; and The ancients induc'd Oceanus alwayes with a Bulls head: propter vim ventorum, à quibus incitatur, &amp; impellitur: vel quia Tauris similem fremitum emittat, vel quia tanquam Taurus furibandus, in littera feratur, Euripid. in Oreste. ??????? ?? ??????????? ?????????? ???????, ?????? ?????.

Niger, in forme and colour of an Æthiope; his haire, and rare beard curled, shaddowed with a blue, and bright mantle: his front, neck, and wrists adorned with pearle, and crowned, with an artificiall wreathe of cane, and paper-rush. These induced the Masquers, which were twelue Nymphs, Negro's; and the daughters of Niger; attended by so many of the Ocianae, which were their light-bearers. The Masquers were placed in a great concaue shell, like mother of pearle, curiously made to moue on those waters, and rise with the billow; the top thereof was stuck with a cheu'ron of lights, which, indented to the proportion of the shell, strooke a glorious beame vpon them, as they were seated, one aboue another: so that they were all seene, but in an extrauagant order. On sides of the shell, did swim sixe huge Sea-monsters, varyed in their shapes, and dispositions, bearing on their backs the twelue torch-bearers; who were planted there in seuerall graces; so as the backs of some were seene; some in purfle, or side; others in face; and all hauing their lights burning out of whelks, or murex shells. The attyre of Masquers was alike, in all, without difference: the colours, azure, and siluer; but returned on the top with a scroll and antique dressing of feathers, and iewells interlaced with ropes of pearle. And, for the front, eare, neck, and wrists, the ornament was of the most choise and orient pearle; best setting off from the black. For the light-bearers, sea-greene, waued about the skirts with gold and The daughters of Oceanus and Tethys, See Hesiod. in Theogon. Orphe. in Hym. and Virgil. in Georg.siluer; their haire loose, and flowing, gyrlanded with sea-grasse, and that stuck with branches of corall. These thus presented, the Scene behind, seemed a vast sea (and vnited with this that flowed forth) from the termination, or horizon of which (being the leuell of the State, which was placed in the vpper end of the hall) was drawne, by the lines of Prospectiue, the whole worke shooting downewards, from the eye; which decorum made it more conspicious, and caught the eye a farre off with a wandring beauty. To which was added an obscure and cloudy night-piece, that made the whole set of. So much for the bodily part. Which was of master Ynigo Iones his designe, and act. By this, one of the Tritons, with the two Sea-Maids, began to sing to the others lowd musique, their voyces being a tenor, and two trebles. SONG. [Triton.

Albion the faire; So call'd of Alluding to the rite of stiling princes, after the name of their princedomes: so is he still Albion, and Neptunes sonne that gouernes. As also his being deare to Neptune, in being so imbrac'd by him. Neptunes son, who ruleth here: For whose deare guard, my selfe, (foure thousand yeere) Since old Deucalion's daies, haue walk'd the round About his empire, proud, to see him crown'd About my waues. At this, the Moone was discouered in the vpper part of the house, triumphant in a Siluer throne, made in figure of a Pyramis. Her garments White, and Siluer, the dressing of her head antique; &amp; crown'd with a Luminarie, or Sph?re of light: which striking on the clouds, and heightned with Siluer, reflected as naturall clouds doe by the splendor of the Moone. The heauen, about her, was vaulted with blue silke, and set with starres of Siluer which had in them their seuerall lights burning. The suddaine sight of which, made Niger to interrupt Ocianvs, with this present passion. NIGER. —O see, our siluer Starre! Whose pure, auspicious light greetes vs, thus farre! The Aethiopians worshipd the Moone, by that surname, See Stepha. ???? ??????. in voce ?????????? and his reasons.Great Æthiopia, Goddesse of our shore, Since, with particular worship we adore Thy generall brightnesse, let particular grace Shyne on my zealous Daughters: Shew the place, Which, long, their longings vrdg'd their eyes to see. Beautifie them, which long haue Deified thee. ÆTHIOPIA. Niger, be glad: Resume the natiue cheare. Thy Daughters labors haue their period here, And so thy errors. I was that bright face Reflected by the Lake, in which thy Race Read mysticke lines; (which skill Pithagoras First taught to men, by a reuerberate glasse) This blessed Isle doth with that Tania end, Which there they saw inscrib'd, and shall extend Wish'd satisfaction to their best desires. Britania, which the triple world admires This Isle hath now recouered for her name; Where raigne those beauties, that with so much fame The sacred Mvses sonnes haue honored, And from bright Hespervs to Eovs spred. With that great name Britania, this blest Isle Hath wonne her ancient dignitie, and stile, A world, diuided from the world: and tri'd The abstract of it, in his generall pride. For were the world, with all his wealth, a ring, Britania (whose new name makes all tongues sing) Might be a Diamant worthy to inchase it, Rul'd by a Svnne, that to this height doth grace it: Whose beames shine day, and night, and are of force To blanch an Æthiope, and reuiue a Cor's. His light scientiall is, and (past mere nature) Can salue the rude defects of euery creature. Call forth thy honor'd Daughters, then; And let them, 'fore the Brittaine men, Indent the Land, with those pure traces They flow with, in their natiue graces. Inuite them, boldly, to the shore, Their beauties shall be scorch'd no more: This sunne is temperate, and refines All things, on which his radiance shines. Here the Tritons sounded, and they danced on shore, euery couple (as they aduanced) seuerally presenting their fans: in one of which were inscribed their mixt Names, in the other a mute Hieroglyphick, expressing their mixed qualities. Which manner of Symbole I rather chose, then Imprese, as well for strangenesse, as relishing of antiquitie, and more applying to that originall doctrine of sculpture, which the Ægyptians are said, first, to haue brought Diod.

Their owne single dance ended, as they were about to make choice of their men: One, from the sea, was heard to call'hem with this charme, sung by a tenor voyce. Song. [Oceanus.] Come away, come away, We grow iealous of your stay: If you doe not stop your eare, We shall haue more cause to feare Syrens of the land, then they To doubt the Syrens of the sea. Here they danc'd with their men, seuerall measures, and corranto's. All which ended, they were againe accited to sea, with a song of two trebles, whose cadences were iterated by a double eccho, from seuerall parts of the land. Song. [Oceaniae.] Daughters of the subtle floud, Doe not let earth longer intertayne you; 1. Ecch. Let earth longer intertayne you. 2. Ecch. Longer intertayne you. 'Tis to them, inough of good, That you giue this little hope, to gayne you. 1. Ecch. Giue this little hope, to gayne you. 2. Ecch. Little hope, to gayne you. If they loue, You shall quickly see; For when to flight you moue, They'll follow you, the more you flee. 1. Ecch. Follow you, the more you flee, 2. Ecch. The more you flee. If not, impute it each to others matter; They are but earth, and what you vow'd was water. 1. Ecch. But earth 1. Ecch. And what you vow'd was water. 2. Ecch. Earth. 2. Ecch. You vow'd was water. ÆTHIOPIA. Inough, bright Nymphs, the night growes old, And we are grieu'd, we cannot hold You longer light: But comfort take. Your father, onely, to the lake Shall make returne: Your selues, with feasts, Must here remayne the Ocean's guests. Nor shall this vaile, the sunne hath cast Aboue your bloud, more summers last. For which, you shall obserue these rites. Thirteene times thrise, on thirteene nights, (So often as I fill my sphære With glorious light, throughout the yeere) You shall (when all things else doe sleepe Saue your chast thoughts) with reuerence, steepe Your bodies in that purer brine, And wholsome dew, call'd Ros-marine: Then with that soft, and gentler fome, Of which, the Ocean yet yeelds some, Whereof bright Venvs, Beavties Queene, Is said to haue begotten beene, You shall your gentler limmes ore-laue, And for your paines, perfection haue. So that, this night, the yeare gone round, You doe againe salute this ground; And, in the beames of yond'bright Sunne, Your faces dry, and all is done. At which, in a Daunce they returned to the Sea, where they tooke their Shell; and, with this full Song, went out. Song. [Oceaniae.] Now Dian, with her burning face, Declines apace: By which our Waters know To ebbe, that late did flow. Back Seas, back Nymphs; but, with a forward grace, Keepe, still, your reuerence to the place: And shout with ioy of fauor, you haue wonne, In sight of Albion, Neptvnes sonne. So ended the first Masque: which (beside the singular grace of Musicke and Daunces) hid that successe in the nobilitie of performance, as nothing needes to the illustration, but the memorie by whom it was personated.</field>
