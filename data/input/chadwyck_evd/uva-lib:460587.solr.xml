      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Library in Lynterne Castle. The Earl and Lady Mabel discovered. Mab. [With a book.] Yes, my dear lord; But have you read this scene? Earl. [Who is seated by table.] I have not. But the point in hand, dear Mabel. Mab. 'Tis full of mirth and sprightly incident, And keen, bright satire, through all which the heart Breathes truth and sympathy! Oh, how I love To track a noble soul in masquerade! Earl. If it so please you, Mabel, that I wait Until your raptures shall expend themselves, I am content. [He arranges papers. Mabel, after a pause, rises and gives the book to the Earl, standing by his side. Mab. You think, dear father, that I trifle. No! You question of a lover; I reply By comment on a bookâthemes separate, As it may seem to you, but in my mind Blended together; for the qualities This book discloses I would have inspire The man to whom my tributary soul Should render its allegiance. Earl. Poor child! the author of the book you laud, This limner of the mind's fastastic dreams, Long ere old age found his art profitless, Foreswore his troth to fancy,âand died rich. [Returns the book. Mab. His book is henceforth sealed to eyes of mine. Oh, how degraded is the venal soul Chartered by its Creator to be free, Yet putting on the dull world's livery, Not the less menial for its golden fringe! [Laying the volume on table. Earl. You are enthusiastic, my fair girl! I blame you not; those who aspire too high Rest nearer heaven than those who ne'er aspired. I love you, Mabel. For me you sum up every human tie Save those which link me to my country's weal. Your mother lives in you, and in some sort You are my age's bride as well as daughter; To lose you were a second widowhood. My only child! sole tenant of the heart Your brothers, did they live, would share with you! Mab. [Embracing him.] O my dear lord and father, well I know Your love, your patient and forgiving love, To your oft wayward Mabel! Your desire Shall guide me in this matter! But command, And I will wed Sir Everard. Earl. At no command unsanctioned by your heart Would I require you wed! Yet would I speak Of poor Sir Everard a word or two, And leave to time and your own heart the judgment. He loves you well, is generous and kind. Mab. He is most kind; he is most generous. Earl. And though he be no genius, has fine taste In arts that charm a woman's eye and ear; Has an accomplished mind and graceful bearing. Mab. That all who know Sir Everard will confess. Earl. Is rich. Mab. He has the broadest lands in Warwickshire. Earl. And has the one great requisiteâhigh birth. Mab. Most true; and yet I hope, possessing these, He has no more than I; for generous, I trust, I am, and riches and descent I know we have, surpassing even his own. Earl. And do you hold these things of light account? Methinks they should be potent arguments. Mab. True; but the heart ne'er guides its choice by logic. There is nought rational in love; it has, Above all reason, high prerogative. Who is there that hath loved because he ought? The meet, the proper, and the dutiful Belong to the head's lore; above all rule Is the heart's passion, gushing like a stream, In its exuberant nature finding law For all it doth, and pouring oft, alas! Its unblessed course along the wilderness Which reason would have taught it to avoid. Earl. Then Mabel is in love; for never, sure, Was one who valued reason less than she. Mab. Not so; for, although reason makes not love, Love may consist with reason; am I right? Now, if you grant me audience, I will Possess you of my secret thoughts, till now Nursed in the solitude of my own heart. He whom my will shall for its king elect Must bring me something more than that I have; Women who marry seldom act but once; Their lot is, ere they wed, obedience Unto a father; thenceforth to a husband; But in the one election which they make, Choice of a mate for life and death, and heaven, They may be said to act. The man they wed Is as the living record of their deed, Their one momentous deed. If he be base, It veils their deed with shame; if he be great, Encircles it with glory; and if good, Haloes it with religion. Would you know Whom I would have to be my husband? Listen, In brief terms I will sketch him. He shall be High born, handsome, I'd rather; but at least With features lit up by the sacred light Which marks the elect band of noble men Whose history is the world's, and whose high names, Linked close with empires, sound their synonymes: With eye that quails not in the war; with voice That thrills the popular ear, and o'erawes senates; And of a wide, ceaseless benevolence, Bounded but by the walls of the great world; And, oh! whene'er affection breathed his name, Or mind did homage to it, should my heart Rush back to the bright hour when first I chose him, Saying it was my act Earl. Well, well, my sweet one! all I would require Is, that the proffered love you cannot take, You should put back with thoughtful gentleness. I censure not your nature. Some there be, Of a romantic spirit like your own, Have thought all decencies chimerical, And linked their fate with that of men obscure, That they might thereby show contempt of station And all that wisdom holds inviolate: But this from you I fear not; you have been Nurtured too well; you are too much my daughter. Mab. You do me justice, sir; think not that I Will e'er disgrace our lineage; whom I wed High in descent, noble in mind, shall be. Earl. Thou art my best beloved; but leave me nowâ [As Mabel is retiring.] Stay, Mabel; one word more with you! To-morrow A visitor named Mordaunt tarries here; Perhaps a week or two as it may be. Show him all kindness; though of humble birth, He is no common man;âmay serve me much. Mab. Mean you the Mordaunt? Earl. I did not know his fame had risen so high As to make him the Mordaunt; but I think We mean the same man; he whose eloquence Has stirred the Commons so. Mab. My Mordaunt is a poet. Earl. True! he has That failing, I believe, and 'tis a great one In public men; but time will cure him of it. Mab. Fie, fie, my lord! Do we not mourn when time Plants wrinkles on the brow? and shall we joy When his touch chills the freshness of the heart? For such is poetry. Earl. Be it so, chit! I'll not contest the point; as to this stranger, Let his reception be most courteous. I would we could persuade Aunt Lydia To doff her stateliness for some few days; It must be looked to; let us seek her, sweet. Mab. With all my heart; [Thoughtfully.] the Mordaunt! [Rousing herself, and giving her hand to Earl.] O, I'm ready. [They go out. SCENE II. Mordaunt's House at Richmond. Enter Lister, Hartwell, Mordaunt, Colville, and Deancourt. Dean. Decide for one of us. Col. My yacht's the thing! After your labours you need change of sceneâ Almost of element, which you shall have, When, the dull land forgotten, our light skiff The Mediterranean skims. Dean. There's nothing beats A good old English houseâthe morning rides; A sweep, perchance, o'er hill and hedge to sound Of the enlivening bugle; then at night The merry party, and the bright fireside, The good old games and stories. Heart. Gentlemen, Duties are sometimes pleasures. Perhaps Mordaunt May hold the cares of public life too dear To wish a respite, though it be recess. Lis. We cannot spare him from us. Col. I will take No answer but his own. Dean. Nor I! Mor. Good friends, Hold me excused, I pray you. Were my will To arbitrate this matter, I would go Delightedly with both; but, as it is, I stand engaged already. [To Heartwell.] That reminds me To ask your eye for this. [Presenting a letter which Heartwell reads. Dean. If it be so, There's nothing left but to regret your absence, And wish you well in ours. Farewell till spring. Col. Adieu, dear Mordaunt. Mor. Heaven be with you, friends. Lis. I'll walk with you. Mor. What! all take flight together? Heart. I'll stay in pity to your solitude. [To the others.] I trust ere you leave London we shall meet. [Lister, Colville, and Deancourt go out. Heartwell carelessly folds up and returns the letter. I had expected this; you are a prize To him who shall have wit to capture you; But who is he? Not this complacent Lynterneâ This sleek and courteous lord. You must have smiled, My Edgar, at each gracious period. He has a high esteem for you, forsooth! Admires your noble views, your mind's great scope! And though he sees in all your daring plans Unsoundness, here and there temerity, He has a marvellous respect for them; And being at this moment respited From cares of State, some portion of his leisure He'd have your sweet society engross! Well, in what terms was your denial couched? Mor. Denial! On what grounds should I refuse Such kindly tendered courtesy? Heart. I did not think your eye, so quick to pierce Public hypocrisy through all the glare With which convention decks it, could have been Dazzled by this man's hollow compliment;â I charge you, spurn this specious show of friendship. Mor. Why call it specious, ere you prove it so? Heart. Upon plain likelihood and inference My censure rests. Mark me! two years ago, When any to another breathed your name, His fellow cried, âWild innovator! Dreamer!â The proud laughed short, âSo, so, the yeoman's son! Why left he team and harrow?â Sages hemmed! âOne of your rising men! Town's full of them.â But now you are a theme of public talkâ Men, as they slowly pace through stately squares, Discuss your latest words of eloquence, And busier folk, who thread the crowded streets, Pause where some window shows the latest page Your name inscribesâa household name in England! Mor. Thanks for your eulogy; but whither tends it? Heart. Even to this: Minds of your order come not every year, Nor are they grown in clusters; instruments Of power; if they be true, of destiny; Truth's pioneers, the vanguard of the world! Now, while the issues undetermined hang Between the just and base, if one step forth, Wily, and smooth of speech, and can arrest The great man's march a moment, turn his eye Upon the glitter of some costly bribe, It may be that he spurns it; and it may be That he becomes Iscariot to his cause. Mor. Nay, nay; speak out, if you would call me traitor! Heart. I mean not so to name you. I but say, Beware this subtle courtier. Mor. The grounds Of your suspicion? Why do you condemn him? Heart. Why? Is he not the sworn foe of our party? Mor. A phrase! I have no party. [Both rise. Heart. Rapidly The poison works; and yet it is not strange That one so loving to his party's foe Should soon disclaim his old associates. Mor. Where is your warrant, sir, To taunt me thus? I say I have no party. You and your friends of late have striven hard For certain ends which I approved; 'twas fit That I should aid youâso far travel with you, As one road served us both. Therefore have I Entered in league with you? or am I bound To follow where your trumpet blows, and fight With whom you list to bid me? Have I sworn To shut my eyes to all the greatness grows In one-half of the empire? That's the oath Ta'en by the partisan. Heart. Well turned and proudly said!âPerhaps your speech May couch itself in humbler tones when meant For the Earl's ear. [A short pause. Mor. Sir, I have known you long; respected you; And it may be, have served you heretofore; And not on slight occasion would I wear The stranger's carriage to you; but take heed. You speak as if I were a parasite, A hireling, an apostate; had my father Broached such surmise of me, it had gone far In recollection of that one dishonour, To merge all kinder memory. Heart. I seek your love No longer than pure friendship's elements Are fruitful in your nature. Let me ask If it be meet that one like you should wait For an occasional condescending smile From this proud nobleman; or haply make, Through ignorance of unaccustomed forms, Mirth for his haughty daughter. But your pardon. Perchance you aim at greatness, and will deign Honour the Lady Mabel with your hand! Mor. Peace, sir. Your language holds not with my mood. By all report, upon the face of earth No fairer or more noble creature moves Than this same Lady Mabel; for the rest, The man who has credentials in his soul, Avouching its immortal ancestry, Presumes but little, even if he seek Alliance with the proudest of the earth. Is it your creed, sir, that in righteous scales The name outweighs the man? Shame on such doctrine! Heart. Nay, shame on you, who dare thus to upbraid An age 'tis fit that you should venerate! Mor. I venerate not age; but, when 'tis present, That which alone makes grey hairs worshipful. It may be by the calendar of years You are the elder man; but 'tis the sun Of power on the mind's dial shining bright And numbering thoughts and deeds that makes true time.â Your pardon, sir, you force me to speak thus. Heart. Farewell, sir! Should we ever meet again, It will be in that deepest of all strangeness Which grows 'twixt those who have loved once, and love not. [Heartwell goes out. Mor. So friendship passes. Well, I will not seek A heart to rule in, if affection's sway Depend on paying dues to interest. I'll not believe that Heartwell judged aright. Lord Lynterne means me fairlyâwill not dare To use me for his tool. Yet, if he doâ Oh, if he do!âmy heart heaves at the thought, So that I fear and quake before myself. There is within me that quick hate of wrong Which, being stung, would spur me on to vengeance, Although the path were fire! And I have, too, That in my nature which would make me slave To genuine kindness. I'll deal with the world As the world deals with me,âif well, its friend,â If otherwise; but for the day, 'tis said, Sufficient is the evil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Drawing-Room in Lynterne Castle. Mordaunt discovered, seated at table, gazing on a miniature of Mabel. Mor. Rumour has not o'erdrawn her. She is rich In beautyâay, in that surpassing beauty Which bears the glorious signet of the soul. I've known her but a month, and yet she seems, As their own light, familiar to my eyes. Would that I Were sprung of noble lineage! That's unworthy. Was not my father tender, constant, upright? And shall I wrong his homely, honest virtues By vain repinings at my humble lot? Heaven sees not with our eyes. That's well, at least. Enter Mabel, carrying a piece of embroidery, on which she occasionally employs herself during the scene. Mab. Good morning! what a bright oneâa fair change From last night's tempest. Mor. 'Twas a stormy night. Mab. [Sitting.] And yet I never knew a briefer one; For that I must thank you; and the sweet tale, In listening which the hours like minutes sped. Mor. [Smiling.] You flatter me. Mab. Although I somewhat wonder That you, whose life is chiefly dedicate To grave State policy, should yet beguile Your leisure with the poet's simple art. Mor. What is the end of all true policy? To work out poetry in act. To feel A deep and constant love for human kind; A sense of beauty's presence, not alone In lofty show, but in its latent haunts, Which few investigateâthe humble hut And bosom meanly clad; worship of justice; The warm emotions of an unchecked nature Which rises, as by instinct, against wrongâ These are the elements of poetry. Is that man fit to be a statesman, think you, Whose heart is stranger to them? Mab. O, how true! Shall I confess that after I retired Your tale dwelt on my mind, moved me to tearsâ Those sweet and tender tears that speak not pain, But soothe whoever sheds them. In my dreams The maid whose fate you told was present still. How fair the old times seem when poets sing them. Oh, would that I had lived in ancient days, The days of dear romance! Do you not think I should have been a heroine? Mor. Why not now? Mab. Alas, alas! there is no scope for it. Comfort has superseded chivalry, There's nothing dangerous or delightful left. [Rising.] O, would that I had been the worshipped one, Of some devoted troubadour, half knight, Half minstrel. My sire, a baron, Irascible and proud, perchance commands That I forswear my troth. I cannot do it. Straight in some chamber, tapestried and lone, I am confined, armed guards before my door. I pen a billet:ââO sweet traveller, Into whose care these tidings, from the hand Of an unhappy maid, shall come, haste thee To SieurâDe Lacy,ââthat shall be his name,â âAnd tell him in this castle's eastern tower His Eleanora lies a prisonerâ For his dear love!â I drop my scroll; its words Are borne to my brave troubadour. Some night, While I sit gazing at the placid moon, Wearing the lucid stars, a diamond wreath, To deck her brighter brow, soft music floats Around my latticeâquick I open it! O joy! 'tis he!âhe scales the wall, secures, Fast by the casement, his elastic stair, Which straightway I descendâI'm on the earthâ I'm on my steed: away! away we fly! I and my troubadour, and in the morn My hand rewards my brave deliverer!â What think you, sir, is not my tale well told? It is my first attempt. You do not smile! Mor. Alas, sweet lady! mournful thoughts were mine. I make no question of your constancy, Your enterprise, your courage; but methinks You scarce had borne the part you paint so well. Mab. Sceptic! why not? [Resuming her seat.] O for one little year Of the romantic past, that I might prove Myself, in your despite, a heroine. Mor. I have known heroines in this modern time;â Ay, there are homesteads which have witnessed deeds That battlefields, with all their bannered pomp, Have little to compare with. Life's great play May, so it have an actor great enough, Be well performed upon a humble stage. Mab. You find such beauty in our dull, tame present, I look on it with kinder eyes. Mor. The forms Of the heroic change from age to age; The spirit in the forms remains the same, Your heroine of old, in love's behalf, Would dare imprisonment and venture flight, Though near her files of lances were arrayed. Your modern heroine, in love's behalf, Will often dare hostility as dread. Not seldom you will meet a maid whose heart Was pledged to one of lowly heritage, But of high qualities, that well atoned The churlish lot of Fortune. Enmity From haughty parents, exile from the sphere, Had been her own from birth, care, poverty, And other ills as weighty, have conspired Against her love, and yet she had avowed it, And cherished it as life. O Lady Mabelâ Mab. Why do you pause? Mor. I fear I weary you. Mab. O no; your heroineâ [Pauses. Mor. Yes; what say you of her? Mab. That although she had acted indiscreetly, For the high love that caused her so to act She should be gently censuredânot cast out. Mor. And of her lover? Mab. Nay, I know not what To say of him. Mor. [Sitting near her.] I knew a lover once Whose heart had poured its riches at the shrine Of one whose lot ranked higher than his own, In the wise world's esteem; and this he knew, Yet could he not recall to his lone breast The feelings thence allured. She was their home, And all beside was foreign. Mab. And she loved him? Mor. His love was silent, and dared scarce intrude Upon her sight. He prayed for herâhe blessed herâ He wept for her; but she heard not his words, Nor saw his tears; for they were breathed and shed In sacred solitude. At times he felt As if the joy of loving were reward; Although she knew it not. He thought of angels Who nightly to the sleeper's couch repair, But vanish ere he wakens. Mab. Did he not Lay his heart open to her? Mor. As I said, He was of lower rank than she, and feared That she might scorn him. Mab. Scorn such fervent worship? Had she so done, she were the thing to scorn. Mor. [With fervour.] You had not spurned him, then? Mab. I cannot dream What I have said to move you. O, this friend! 'Tis like you loved him as a very brother, And own a debt to all who pity him. Your story interests. How ended it? And was this long since? Mor. It is very strange. I cannot call the time to mind. I know The truth of what I tell, but nothing more. Enter the Earl and Lady Lydia. Lyd. Not out yet, Mabel? Should you thus permit The freshness of the morning to escape? 'Tis three o'clock already. Mab. Is it so late? [To Mordaunt.] Do you ride with us? [To Lord Lynterne.] And you? Nay, you must; I know you will; these are your holidays. Earl. I may not, sweetest. Mab. No? [To Mordaunt.] You then will be Our single cavalier. Earl. I fear, dear Mabel, I must assert a prior claim to Mordaunt. We've grave and pressing matters to discuss. Mab. [After a short pause.] 'Tis very late. I will not ride to-day. Lyd. [Apart to her.] You will. Mab. I think you said that it was late? Lyd. [Apart to her.] Go for my sake. Mab. Well, if it please you, aunt. Earl. Adieu! Mor. A pleasant morning! Lyd. Thank you, thank you! [Earl and Mordaunt go out. Lady Lydia walks after them, and then advances to Mabel, who is seated. Lyd. Mabel, you love that man! Mab. Love whom? Sir Everard? Lyd. This is evasion. I know you have refused Sir Everard. I say you love this Mordaunt. Mab. I fail to comprehend you. Lyd. You deny it? Mab. [Haughtily, rising.] It does not need denial. Edgar Mordaunt! Lyd. Pardon me! I did but jest. I knew you loved him not; It was impossible, for he has nothing In station, fortune, or in qualities That can excite esteem, far less affection. Mab. O, now methinks that you are somewhat harsh. Lyd. Harsh! would you have me measured in my speech? I am beside myself to see a man, Whose birth had fitted well your father's groom, Thus licensed to invade our privacy, And wear before us the familiar air Of one inured to dignity! Mab. Good aunt, Men three relations hold to dignity: By gradual use some grow inured to it, And some are born to it; but there be those Born of it, natured of its element; With them nobility is personal, And they must die ere it can. Lyd. In which rank place you Mordaunt? Mab. In the last. Lyd. What strange infatuation blinds you thus? Can you not read the obvious history Of an ambitious and time-serving man? What does he here who was your father's foe Upon all public questions? Trust me, Mabel, He is of those who, by exciting speech And persevering effort, make their names Of value in the mart of policy, And sell them to the man who offers most. Mab. Madam, 'tis falseâhis heart is honour's home, His deeds her witnessesâO, foully false! Lyd. This is unmaidenly and insolent! Does no shame flush your cheek? or wherefore is it You should forget all deference to me In favour of a stranger? Mab. Because he is a stranger, And has no friend to spurn back calumny, When those whose guest he is, forget the rights Owing to hospitality and justice. [Throws herself into a chair. Lyd. Justice! Under that poor pretence, your passion, No longer coy, speaks plainly. I had hoped My eyes deceived me when they watched your own Pouring the light of unchecked feeling on him. I strove to think it was but courtesy That hushed your very breathing when he spoke. But the truth flashes on me, I thank heaven! O shame that this adventurer should depart Boasting your love his trophy, which to wear Waits but his time of taking! Suit your manners More to the decent, less to the fantastic, Or I will to your father, and require His comment on your conduct. Mab. To my father? You threaten, Lady Lydia! Lyd. Yes; why not? Mab. I am amazed you can, so strange it seems That you, whose words suffice to show what you are, Should dare rebuke that I am. I wonder not you value station so: It is but a poor treasure in itself, Yet becomes rich when 'tis the sole possession. Believe me, noble spirits never wrap Honour so closely round them as to let The garment hide the wearer. Rank's a robe Which sits the best when negligently worn, Disclosing the mind's perfect symmetry That needs not gorgeous attire to grace it. Lyd. [Aside.] I have gone too far.âMabel, could you have looked Into my heart, you would have spared me this. Mab. Could you have sounded mine, I do not think You would have ventured to this length of insult. Lyd. Insult! Mabel! And is your father's sister's love so strange, That when it would advise you, guard you, save you, You should miscal it thus? Perhaps my zeal Took an impatient tone, but did not need The deep rebuke it suffered. Mab. [Approaching her.] I have been wrong, dear aunt; but still I say, You judge poor Mordaunt harshly. Lyd. He's ambitious. Mab. What's he that is not so? Ambition, aunt, Is instinct in great minds, even as to soar Is nature to the eagle. Lyd. This plausible And general reasoning, however just, Meets not the special instance. We were asked To entertain this stranger for a week; A month has rolled away. If you would ride, Straight he needs exercise; stay you at home, He finds the air too sultry, feels fatigued, And keeps the house; beside all which, but note How much he adds by glances, motions, sighs, Smiles, even cast of visage, to his words, Which, as I lately said, your eyes reward With interest more than maidenly. Mab. Nay, gentle aunt, I am not carved from stone, and cannot hear Music without emotion, nor unmoved Look on a flower, or aught that's beautiful; And must I, when a glowing sentiment Or noble thought finds utterance, emulate The barren rock that never pays the sun With produce for his smiles? O, blame me not, If at discourse on themes magnificent My eyes light up with joy! They testify Love to the speaker's thoughts, not to himself. Lyd. The speaker will not make that nice distinction; And, to be plain, he has sufficient cause To augur thatâ Mab. That I esteem, admire him; I will not wrong him so as to surmise He dreams of more. He knows what bounds divide us. But let us hasten, 'tis so very late. I trust we're friends again. You'll follow me? [Lady Mabel goes out. Lyd. Esteem and admiration! She would dupe me Even as she dupes herself! No; this is love, And has gone further than I thought. This Mordaunt Is an accomplished player on the heart; That praise I'll give him. He must read success In the girl's face, which, like a mirror, shows The image of his thoughts. Should this proceed, No motives, counsel, prayer, threat, influence, Will stand between her and her love. Well, then, I and this schemer are at war! I'll watch His demonstrations one more week; if then He purpose longer stay, I'll in plain terms Urge his departure; if he still remain, I'll tempt him to disclosure of his end Before it ripen further, and thus shake In spring the blossoms autumn had seen fruit. [She goes out slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A terrace in front of Lynterne Castle. Sunset. Enter Mordaunt. Mor. How beautiful are all things when we love! The illuminated globe revolves around The loved one as its axis of pure light. She whom I love is human; for her sake I love all human-kindâyea, all that is. Whene'er birds sing, she hears them in her walks, Or from her open lattice; henceforth birds Are sacred to my soul. The sun, that lights Her daily path; mild moon, and solemn stars, That shine into her chamber; trees, her shade From noontide heat; rivers, whose winding way And murmuring song console her when she strays By their green banks at eve; delighted flowers, That yield their fragrance to her; forest paths Pressed by her feetâI love. Our planet earth Is her abode; for her sake I love earth, And for earth's sake love all that earth contains. O, it is great, and wise, and good to love! To feel we live in all things, and that they Live by us, and not we by them; to be The pulse to our own universe! And loves she me? She listens to my words, and seldom speaks. Why need she speak, when every glance replies? First it was otherwise; her repartee, Quick wit, and lively sallies flashed all day; Her answers now are few and brief, as though The task of ordering her thoughts for speech Woke her from blissful dreams; my soul itself Seemed suffused in her presence, bathed in light, As plants beneath the solemn, tender moon, Which gilds their life with beauty, as she mine, And joys in heaven to see their silvered leaves, Unknowing 'tis her smile that makes their brightness, Which fades from earth whene'er she wanes in heaven. A cloud comes over mine. 'Tis Lady Lydia! Enter Lady Lydia. I trust you find the evening breeze refresh you? Lyd. A debtor to your wishes, sir! I thank you. [Aside.] I'll not delay, for opportunity, Once slighted, oft escapes. When do you leave us? Mor. Shortly. Perhaps within a week or two, Provided for that time my sojourn prove No inconvenience here. Lyd. I fear it will. Mor. Had I thought so, you had not seen me now. Lyd. I will be plain, sir. Plainness is always the best courtesy Where truths are to be told. You still are young, And want not personal grace; your air, your words, Are such as captivate. You understand me? Mor. Scarcely; for these things most men harbour guests. Lyd. True; except sometimes When they are fathers. You are honourable, And, after what has passed, will leave us straight. Mor. I scarcely dare presume to give your words Their nearest meaning! Lyd. Yet you may do so. Mor. The Lady Mabel? Lyd. Yes. Mor. Looks not on me indifferently? Lyd. That you will join me in regretting, sir. Mor. I may hopeâ [Pauses in agitation. Lyd. She has confessed it. Mor. In your hearing? Lyd. You are minute, I see, and well may doubt, Except on surer witness than surmise, So strange a tale. Alas! the evidence Courts sight and touch: I hold it in my handâ This letterâ[Mordaunt regards her inquiringly.]ânothingâ[As with a sudden impulse.]âI dare trust your honour. You know I lately spent three days from home: I then wrote Mabel what I could not speakâ My warning on the signs I had perceived Of love's unconscious growth. This is her answer. [Showing letter. I was too late. That answer boreâO patience!â What can I call it else?âher love's confession. Mor. Her love for me! Lyd. Forgive me, 'tis too much. [Tears it. Thus let the winds disperse the proofs of shame! 'Twould be most happy were its memory As easily effaced. [Throwing away the fragments. Mor. Her love for me! Lyd. In wordsâ Mor. O, name them not, Those sacred breathings of her soulârelate not What precious items make my sum of bliss Past computation rich! Enough, she loves me! I'll seek her on the instant. [Going. Lyd. [Aside.] That, indeed, Would mar my plan. No; silence is your course: It is most delicate, least painful, too. No word were well save farewell, and that said As those who have no long acquaintance say it. Mor. I will not say it So to the Lady Mabel now, or ever, Unless it be her will. Lyd. You will not take Advantage of her weakness. Do not, sir, Let it be thought that we, in welcoming you, Shook hands with an adventurer. Mor. [Indignantly.] Madam! [With constrained courtesy. You are her relative, and I am dumb. [Going. Lyd. Stay. Think you the Earl's voice would not crush your plan, The moment that surprise permitted speech? Mor. Why should it? Lyd. Must I speak outright! Mor. Yes, surely. Lyd. The house of Lynterne Dates from the time that he of Normandy O'erthrew the Saxon sway; since then its lords, In war or peace, have held the foremost rank In conflict or in council. Of the race, Not one has formed alliance, save with such As boasted kindred honours. Sir, our house Is nobleâmust remain so till its end. Mor. Is not yon sunset splendid? Lyd. Possibly; But we may see that often, and it bears Not now on our discourse. Mor. Indeed it does. However proud, or great, or wise, or valiant The Lady Mabel's ancestors, that sun From age to age has watched their honours end, As man by man fell off; and centuries hence Yon light into oblivion may have lit As many stately trains as now have passed. And yet my soul, orb of eternity, When yonder globe is ashes as your sires, Shall shine on undecaying! When men know What their own natures are, and feel what God Intended them to be, they are not awed By pomps the sun outlives. Lyd. Think of me as your friendâwhen you are gone. You have a towering spirit. Had the rank And blood of Lady Mabel been as yours, I had not said a word to spite your wish. Mor. You see this ring? Lyd. I have admired it oft. Would you thus hint That you are rich? Mor. Is not the setting precious! Lyd. The diamond is superb! Mor. True; but the setting? Lyd. The diamond is the treasure. Mor. No, the setting! Lyd. The setting is but silver, worthless, base, Contrasted with the stone. Mor. True, Lady Lydia. Then when I treat for merchandise would buy All stars of heaven up, were they diamond worlds,â A peerless woman's love,âwhy runs your phrase, âYou might have had that unmatched gem for nought Had it not been so set,â in ancestry Or some such silver rim? Enough of this; I'll now to Lady Mabel. [Going. Lyd. Be advised. If you persist in this strange scheme, seek first An audience of the Earl: if he consent, The which is most unlikely, Mabel's love Is honourably yours; if he refuse, You incur no disgrace, as you would do Luring his daughter's heart unknown to him. Mor. The Earl is in the library even now. I'll learn his thoughts at once. Lyd. I pity you. It will be a hard task for your high spirit To sue the Earl in such a humble strain As will be requisite. Mor. Humble! IâMordaunt! Lyd. Your ground is delicate; you must be cautious; Confess your low estate, and own the prize You seek to gain far beyond your desert; You must put by your recent haughty tone And kingly glances; plead with downcast eye And hesitating voice; all this, I say, Must keenly gall your nature; and therefore I pity you. Mor. I were indeed a slave, And needing pity, could I so forget My manhood; but 'twere vain to reason more With one who knows me not. [He bows with cold dignity, and goes out. Lyd. O, this is well! He'll to my brother in a haughty moodâ The very one I wished for; 'twill arouse All the Earl's latent pride. And now for Mabel! Upon the wish she comes. [Retires to back. Enter Lady Mabel; she comes on slowly, and in thought. Mab. Why have not noble natures noble names? Or why are names of import? O world, world! With many a captious custom dost thou bind The heart that seeks enlargement! What is birth? The gift I prized seems my misfortune now. I know none like to Mordaunt. Even my father Honours and courts him. What is this to me? A line invisible divides our fates. O, would that he had rankâthat he were poor, So he were well derived! The day may come When he will earn nobility, and men Of prouder birth may court his smile; and then, Perchance (for love is strong), I might descend A few steps from my pinnacle. Fool! fool! This is a dream of summer and of youth. I know not my own soul; 'tis ardent now, But years may chill it into apathy. Why not?â'tis thus with others. I could weep. Lyd. [Advancing.] So, you've been secret, Mabel, 'Twas hardly kind; but I waive all displeasure. I trust you may be happy. Mab. This is strange language, aunt. Lyd. I might reply, Yours is strange conduct, niece: but let that pass. My brother too was silent; but I fancy He understood it all; perhaps had planned it Before his guest arrived. Mab. Planned what? What guest? Try me not thus! Your meaning in a word? Lyd. Why counterfeit surprise? Do you not know Mordaunt is with your father, even now? Mab. Well, what is that to me? Lyd. Much, I should say, Were I now young, in love, and knew what boon The man I loved was seeking from my father. Mab. You jest. Lyd. I am in earnest. He had your consent, Doubtless, to back his prayer. Mab. No; never, never! Lyd. Not in strict formal terms, perhaps, but still By such expressions as the timid use To help the lips' checked utterance by the eye. Mab. I never spoke the word presumption's self Could torture to a pledge of love for him. Lyd. I am amazed! it is not half an hour Since his own lips assured me that the Earl Must needs confirm his choice. Mab. Presuming arrogance! Lyd. He spoke in easy strain, His air half buoyancy, half carelessness, As though success were slave to him, and came Without the pains of calling. Mab. What sanction have I given him thus to boast? Lyd. I warned you once to guard, lest what you meant For courtesy he should interpret love. Mab. I never passed the bound of courtesy. Lyd. You meant it not, that's certain; but, forgive me, At times I thought myself the bound was passed. Did you not tell me, Mabel, that the Earl Requested special kindness for this man? Mab. [With sudden indignation.] What man? Lyd. This gentleman, this Mordaunt, at whose hands The Earl looked for some service. Am I right? Mab. Yes; so he said. Lyd. Then what can be more plain? Your father seeks support in power from Mordaunt, Which he intends to sellâthe price, your hand. How now! you shiver; yet the air is mild. Mab. The mind has seasons like the body, aunt. My father shall resent this. Buy my hand! Lyd. You may depend he means it. Mab. So you said. Why is your tone so measured, and your look So calm on this occasion? Where's the fire That should be in your eyes? Your temper's sweet; But now I like it not, I like it not! [Weeps. Lyd. I cannot chide If under quick excitement at your wrong You are unjust to me. A step! Enter Servant. Well! Ser. Madam, My lord would see you and the Lady Mabel; He waits you in the library. [He goes out. Lyd. Come, Mabel; Nay, sweet, take heart! Mab. What is there I should fear? Let us be going, aunt;âI'm calmâquite calm. [They go out. SCENE II. Library, as before. The Earl and Mordaunt discovered. Mor. Is love a crime? Can we prevent its coming? or when come, Can we command it from us? Earl. We may, at least, Curb its expression, when disgrace and grief Are like to follow it. Mor. Disgrace! Your daughter's noble, fair, and good; I shall not feel disgraced in taking her. Earl. [Sitting.] Sir! you are insolent. Enter Lady Mabel and Lady Lydia. Mabel, my child, Have I not loved you truly, shown all kindness That is a daughter's due? Mab. Indeed you have. Earl. Have you done well In making stranger to a father's heart The dearest wish of yours?âin plighting faith For life, unknown to him who gave you life? Mab. This have I never done. Mor. Tell all, speak frankly; Have you not, Lady Mabel, given me proof Of favour in your sight will justify The boon I have entreated of the Earlâ Permission to be ranked as one who seeks For closer union with you than a friend's? I know you gave no pledge; but looks and deeds, And words whose precious sense was in their tonesâ These bade me love! Was it not so? Answer, Mabel! Mab. Mabel! the Lady Mabel, when you speak. Lyd. She utterly denies what you infer. Mab. Yes, utterly. Mor. And Lady Lydia speaks thus; She who confirmed my hopes!âI see, for sport. Lyd. We think you but presumptuous; let your honour Guard you from veiling shame by sin; nor strive From loose discourse, spoken in pleasantry, To justify your conduct. Mor. And the letter? Lyd. The letter! He's distracted. Mab. Letter! [Apart to Lydia.] Aunt? Lyd. Yes, love. Mab. [Aside.] No, no; I will not wrong her; it is plain His folly has deceived him. Mor. May I then ask, If you have never loved me, why you deigned To wear love's semblance; deigned, when I approached, To feign joy's sudden smile; to urge my stay With lips that, faltering, won me, and with eyes That pleaded more by drooping; hour by hour To sit half mute and bid me still speak on, Then pay me with a glance in which there seemed A heart's whole volume writ? Mab. [Sitting.] This is too much. Whate'er my kindness meant, it did not mean To foster your presumption, though, perhaps, Suspecting it, and lacking at the time Better employment, I allowed it scope, Did not repress it harshly, and amused, Rather than angered, failed to put a bound To its extravagance. Mor. All, then, has been a jest; the thing resolves Itself into a harmless badinage! You had no other toy, so took my heart To while away an hour. The plaything broke; But then it was amusement! Lyd. You were honoured In thus assisting to beguile the hours Of Lady Mabel's solitude. Mor. Honoured, say you? Men's hearts have leaped within them at my words. The lowly have adored me, and the proudâ Ay, sir, the proudâhave courted me; you know it. Lyd. All this would sound much to your credit, sir, Were other lips to speak it. Mor. Understand me. You deem me proud. I am so; and yet humble: [To Mabel.] To you I would have been a slave; have moulded Each wish to your desire; have laid my fame, Though earth had ratified it, at your feet, Nor deemed the offering worthy of your smile! But when, admitting what I am, you scorn me For what my father was, sport with me, trample On the same hopes you fostered, then I claim The patent which the Great Paternity Of heaven assigns to natureânot descentâ And walk before you in the march of time! Lyd. The stale, fond trickâto boast of honours stored In ether, where no human eye can pierce. You may be prince of several starsâpossess All cloudland for your realm; but one poor knighthood, Conferred by a real sword upon real shoulders, Beats fifty thousand dukedoms in the air. The old, convenient trick! Earl. Nay, courtesy! Lyd. You'll suffer us to go? Earl. Yes, leave me. [Mabel rises; they are about to go. Mor. Stay! Before we part, I have a word or two For Lady Mabel's ear. [To Mabel.] I know right well The world has no tribunal to avenge An injury like mine; you may allure The human heart to love, warm it with smiles, To aspirations of a dream-like bliss, From which to wake is madnessâand when spells Of your enchantment have enslaved it quite, So that you are its world, its light, its life, And all beside is dark and void and deadâ I say, that very heart, brought to this pass, You may spurn from your path, pass on and jest, And the crowd will jest with you; you may glide, With eye as radiant, and with brow as smooth, And feet as light, through your charmed worshippers, As though the angel's pen had failed to trace The record of your crime; and every night, Lulled by soft flatteries, you may calmly sleep As do the innocent; but it is crime, Deep crime, that you commit! Had you for sport Trampled upon the earth a favourite rose, Pride of the garden, or in wantonness Cast in the sea a jewel not your own, All men had held you guilty of offence! Lyd. [To Earl.] Is it fit that longer you should brook this censure? Mor. And is it then no sin To crush those flowers of life, our freshest hopes, With all the incipient beauty in the bud, Which know no second growth? to cast our faith In human-kind, the only amulet By which the soul walks fearless through the world, Into those floods of bitter memory Whose awful depths no diver dares explore? To paralyse the expectant mind, while yet On the world's threshold, and existence' self To drain of all save its inert endurance? To do this unprovokedâI put it to you, Is not this sin? To the unsleeping eye Of Him who sees all aims, and knows the wrongs No laws save His redress, I make appeal To judge between us! Earl. Sir, our conference Is ended. Mor. It is ended. [He goes out. Mab. He's deceived! He hears me not! He knows me not! He's gone! Earl. Why, what is this, dear Mabel? Mab. Nothing, sir. I am not used, you know, to witness strife. It somewhat chafes my spirit. Earl. Hither, love. [Mabel reels forward, and falls into her father's arms. [An interval of Five Years is supposed to elapse between the Third and Fourth Acts.]</field>

All which he owed To Lady Lydia, his aunt elect. She told the farceâso then she called his suitâ With such malicious wit, 'twas London's jest. Scarce any one dared know him. It amazed me To see him, thus the mark for public scorn, Calmly outbrave it, give his mind entire To public duties, daily gathering friends, Until his strength so grew, the Earl conceded All our demands; then sought him for a son. Col. The Minister, and not the father, sought him. Lis. Proceeds the match with Lady Mabel's will? Heart. Her cold and pensive carriage testify In this she only brooks her father's choice. Not ours to scan too nicely. Pass we on: The Lady Lydia and her nephew come. Enter Lady Lydia and Captain Pierpoint. [Bows to Lady Lydia.] Fine weather and fair promise for to-morrow. Lyd. Fair as our brightest hopes are, gentlemen. [Lister, Heartwell, Deancourt, and Colville go out. Lyd. You know already These are the members of a factious clique Mordaunt has brought to notice of the Earl. Pier. You scarce bear Mordaunt better will than I. Lyd. We do not idolise our future kinsman. Pier. Who won his way, no doubt, by artifice And smooth insinuation? Lyd. No; the truth, Though bitter, must be granted. Haughtily He trod his separate path. Alone, he forced His way to power and rank. My brother bought His service by concessions, claimed the more; The more were granted. Out of weakness grew Necessity for compact, and, in fine, This union was offered, almost pressed,â It costs a pang to own it, by the Earl. Had I been he!âbut this is folly. Pier. What Intend you now? Lyd. To bear what can't be shunned. When first my brother named this humbling contract, I wrote to Mordaunt, asked an interview, And wrought him to belief that Mabel's heart Shrank from this union, though her hand, indeed, Obeyed her father. This looked plausible; For a still pensive mood has ruled her lateâ Seldom dispersed, and then for reckless mirth. Pier. So he believes she never loved him? Lyd. Fully. In proof of which he's seldom here; and then He greets her distantly. He pressed the marriage With most indelicate haste; no time for wooing, Little for preparation. A proud alliance Bribed him, and not a heart. Pier. [Indignantly.] Aunt! Lyd. [Interrupting.] Since we're conquered, Let's even make the best of it. Here come A group of bland nonentities. Enter Lord and Lady Chatterly, Sir Archer, and Lady Taunton. Ah, good friends! With smiling faces as befits the time. Lord C. Dear Lady Lydia, We share your happiness in seeing it. Lyd. You're good to say so. Happiness like mine Grows by participation. Sir A. Lady Mabel Has positively had no mercy on usâ Her wit's so brilliant, pungent, piercing andâ [Hesitates. Lord C. Truly enchanting. Lady C. 'Tis benevolence In you to call it so; for 'twas indulged Greatly at your expense. Lady T. Nay! that's severe. Sir A. A little too severe, but in plain truth, Mordaunt's much to be envied. Lyd. Surely, not More than my niece. Lady T. Mordaunt!âIs he connected With the old family in Devonshire. Lyd. This gentleman is of a race whose rise Is far more ancient.âBut 'tis near the hour My brother named to read the marriage-deed. [All are about to go. Enter Mabel. Your pardon for a moment; I'll soon follow. [Guests and Pierpoint go out. She advances to meet Mabel. Nay, be of better cheer. Should one betrothed Upon her bridal-eve look downcast thus? A strange foreboding shadow clouds your brow, I marked not ere this wooing. O my child! Carry it gaily; go among your guests; Be liberal of your smiles, free of your mirth, As one should be upon the verge of joy. Mab. Believe me, I have striven to do my best, Nor quite in vain; nay, heard you not yourself Our sprightly jests, as I led forth the train Through the wood's maze? Oh, we were very gay! Lyd. I was not unobservant of your mirth; It did not please me, Mabel; it was strained, Abruptâwanted tranquility; your tones Were quicker than belong to quiet joy; Your smiles not such as peace serenely wears. Mab. You are right; and I, it seems, am not so skilled As I had thought in artifice. Yes, aunt! There is a care lies heavy at my heart. Lyd. Confide it, love! Mab. I fear that time has changed him. Lyd. You mean Sir Edgar? Mab. Ay: 'tis even so. Lyd. Despite of which, your love still perseveres? Mab. True love, though tender, is immortal tooâ Easy to wound, incapable of death. Not that he has at any time been harsh, At least in words; but that to me seems stern Which others might not deem so. Public cares Leave him few hours for converse, and in those He speaks me formally. Then I grow cold, And proudly hide my heart. I know I'm blameful To tell you this; but then I have no mother, Whose voice might solace weakness or reprove it. Lyd. Alas! sweet niece, you merit better fate. Mab. Why say so, aunt? I have in nought accused him Except in change; such change as comes like growth, Sure but unnoted. Lyd. But you kept my counsel, Avoided all recurrence to the past? Mab. We have not spoken of it. Much I fear It steals upon his memory, and clouds The sunshine of his love. Lyd. I would fain hope The best, dear Mabel. You did well at least In keeping silence; but we shall be late. You know your father's wishes are to grace Your nuptials with all ceremony, whence This public reading of the marriage treaty. Would I could bribe those lips to smile. Come, love! [They go out. Enter Mordaunt, looking after them. Mor. 'Tis she. What sad reluctance in her step! The conscious victim in each gesture speaks. True, true, confirmed by many a certain sign, The Lady Lydia's tale! She loves me not, And curbs her loathing at her father's will, Whose interest and ambition force her handâ His child's handâto the man she spurned before, And yet despises. Shame that to my breast They bind a form that inwardly recoils! There's the one drop that overflows the cup, And makes endurance treason to mankind! She turns within. What witchery of grace! Proud scorner, I could love thee, spite of scorn! Ill fits this mood the time. Hence, yielding self; No private weakness now. No! though each word Were coined in fires that fed upon my heart, I'd speak their rights whom nature crowns and man's Poor pride would crush. So, lady, heart, take heart! Thy cause I champion here, no less than mine, And haste to snatch thee from my father's doom! Enter Servant. Ser. My lord, sir, seeks your presence. Mor. Does he so? I will attend him instantly; I come. [Mordaunt and Servant go out. SCENE II. Library as before. Earl of Lynterne, Mordaunt, Heartwell, Lister, Colville, Deancourt, Pierpoint, Lady Lydia, Lady Mabel, Lord and Lady Chatterly, Sir Archer and Lady Taunton, and other Wedding Guests, with Solicitor, enter and take places. Earl. Good friends, assembled here to confer honour Upon the near espousals, I beseech Your kind attention while this gentleman Reads in your hearing the accustomed deed Determining the rights and property Of such as stand affianced. [Solicitor is about to rise. Mor. [Rising.] My Lord Lynterne, And guests who grace us with your presence here, I've that to say, which 'twere unseasonable To broach at any later stage than this. Deem you not me much honoured, who have sprung From lineage obscure, in this alliance With a most noble lady, who can trace An ancestry which from the Conqueror's time Has never mingled blood with churl's before? Lyd. [Aside.] What frantic scheme has this man now to compass?â You're modest, sir, and underrate your birth. Mor. Not so. My father was a man of toil; I mean real toil, such toil as makes the hand Uncouth to sight, coarse, hard to the touch; There are none here who would have clasped that hand Save at our borough contests, when all fingers Grew marvellously pliant. Lyd. Well this frankness Becomes a noble mind! How great it is To rise by our desert from lowliness, And blush not at its memory! Omnes. Most noble! Dean. [To Heartwell apart.] I understand not this. Heart. There's meaning in it. Mor. You would do honour then, good friends, to him Who from obscurity should win his way To eminence and power? Lord C. Such men adorn their country! Sir A. Their merit Transcends all praise! Lyd. They are earth's master spirits! Mor. Then had you known one such in his first years Of effort, you had aided himâat least, Given him encouragement, showed him respect? Lady C. Respect most due! Lady T. Decidedly! Who doubts it? Mor. You had been just, and had not plotted then Against his peace, nor baited with such smiles As the heart loves to feed on, the dire poison Of wanton, causeless scorn? Lyd. Why ask them this, knowing that they would not? Lady C. Who would be guilty of such crime? Lady T. Oh, no one! Mor. But did such live, what should be their desert? Earl. You trespass, sir, too much upon the time Of this high company. Methinks 'twere well The lawyer should proceed. Mor. I am indifferent. Earl. Mean you to wed my daughter? Mor. [Turning fiercely on him.] No! [All rise in surprise. Pier. Malignant viper! you shall dearly pay The debt of this disgrace. Mor. Yet hold awhile. If you accuse me, grant me the same rights That all accused enjoy. Hear my defence! That over, I will bide whatever shape Your anger wills to take. Earl. Begone, sir!âleave us, while contempt stills wrath. Mab. I do beseech you hear him. I am curious To learn what sins of my commission urged To deed so pitiful. If I had wrongedâ Lord C. Even then it was most pitiful revenge. Lady C. Most pitiful retort! Lady T. Most infamous! Lyd. But still consistent with his character? Chorus of Voices. Oh yes, yes, yes! With hisâpast doubt! Mor. Why, see now, How much your expectations mock your acts! You sow the heart with bitterness, and marvel That it bears kindless fruit;âthe slave's treatment Is what you give man, and the angel's meekness Is what you demand from him! 'Tis five years Since this same Lady Mabel lured my soul With such soft phrases and such winning words As only leave the words âI loveâ unsaid. 'Twas not my vanity that thus construed These signs of tenderness. The Lady Lydia Noted their import; duped me with feigned proofs, To think my love returnedâ Pier. Audacious! Lyd. [Scornfully.] Hear him! Mor. Deluded thus, I straightway sought the Earl, Entreated his permission to be ranked As Lady Mabel's suitor; when it pleased her Smilingly to admit that she had toyed With me, to while away an idle hour. I hasted home. In a few days the tale Of my crushed love was blazoned to the world! A proud heart's honest passion woke to life, By specious smiles and studied blandishments, But to be trampled onâthe deep excess Of passionate devotionâcharm of day, And dream of night, and hope of lifeâit wasâ It was all this to meâblown, published, chorused In the quick ear of scoffers! This low churl, This foiled plebeian aspirant, supplied Mirth for a thousand jesters. What presumption In him to love thus! Mark! Years passed; that churl Rose to power's summit. From his arms still shrank The loved one of his youth. A father's law Now forced her struggling hand, and bade him take The victim, where he once had hoped the wife! Pier. No more, I say! Mor. For once be men and women. Have you loved ever? known what 'tis to stake Your heart's whole capital of blessedness Upon one die, the chance of love returned? To lose the cast, go forth with beggared soul, And hear scorn's pack pursue you; cheered by those Who tempted but to ruin? âStay,â you cry; âYour case is changed since then!â By what? âSuccess.â Success! I cast it off. [To Lady Lydia and the Earl.] Madamâmy lord Here in your stately halls; here where your robes Of blazoned memories thickly fold you in; I standâGod's common work, a naked heartâ To say, the prize that lured, then scorned my love, I scorn to take in barter for success! Earl. Enough, sir! You have had your vengeance. Hence! Mor. I have not sought for vengeance in this act. My life, my energies, my talents, all Were meant for nobler uses than belong To a mere private feud; but I have fought A battle for high principles, and taught Convention, when it dares to tread down man, Man shall arise in turn and tread it down! As for this ladyâshe has never loved me, Nor have I lately sought to win her love; I would not wreak on her such wretchedness As she caused me for pastime. I have done. My errand is fulfilled. [Going. Pier. You go not thus! Mab. [Rushing forward and arresting him with great agitation.] Upon your life, Injure him not! Stir not a step I say! [Mordaunt regards her earnestly. He is not worthy of it. [Mordaunt goes out followed by Heartwell and Deancourt. [In the interval between the Fourth and Fifth Acts the season changes from Summer to Autumn.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Library in Lynterne Castle, as before. Physician and Earl discovered. Phy. Have you, my lord, of late received account Of Lady Lydia's state? Earl. No recent news; poor sister Lydia! When first suspicion dawned that my child's grief Was wearing health away, her aunt, o'ercome By daily witness of such touching woe, Caught its infectionâstrength and peace forsook her. Still her condition varies with your patient's; When Mabel seems to rally, our report Is answered by good tidings of her aunt; And when the one declinesâdeclines the other. From Venice, where my sister purposes Some few months' stay, I anxiously wait letters. But say, how fares it with my blessÃ¨d one? Tell me the worst.âNay, pause a moment.âNow I think that I am man enough to hear you. Phy. The mind is our chief enemy; And failing its alliance, all endeavour Hastens the evil it would fain arrest. Could we obliterate the past, efface All memory of this wrong, whose double edge Wounds both her love and pride, recall to life Her hopes and her affectionsâ Earl. Cease, sir, to torture me; 'tis mockery To name specifics out of human grasp. Enter Servant announcing Lady Lydia, who enters in travelling costume. Servant goes out. Earl. (advancing to meet her) My sister! dearest Lydia, you are changed! Lyd. Speak not of me. Mabel! is she much altered? Earl. Alas! much altered, as yourself may see. Enter Mabel, supported by an Attendantâthe Physician places a chair for her; they conduct Mabel to it. Attendant goes out. Lyd. [Who has kept her eyes on the ground, suddenly raising them as she faces her niece.] Ha! I need not support; let us embrace. No, no, it is forbidden! Mab. Forbidden! Lyd. By Conscience, The Haunter, the Avenger who can bow Wills tyrants cannot moveâextort deep groans From men mute on the rackâand from the lips Of guilty pride, which the flame's agony Cannot distort or open, wring the tale Of sin and degradation. Earl. [To Physician.] What can this mean? I fear her mind's disturbed. Lyd. [Overhearing him.] True! but not in your sense; now, listen to me. I am my niece's murderer! [Mabel looks up. Earl. [Compassionately.] Poor, poor unfortunate! Lyd. I did not drug her drink With poison, nor at night with unsheathed blade Startle her chamber's darkness; but by arts Born of infernal pride, I poisoned hopes That outvie life in worth, and plunged my dart Where it is mercy to stab mortally, Such anguish follows where the wound is made. Mab. Oh, mercy! mercy! You deceived me there? Lyd. When he who shall be nameless was our guest, I prompted him at once to ask your hand, Assured him of your love, which I declared Yourself had owned to me. With sinful wiles I taught you to believe that he had dared To ask you of your father as the hire For future service. I awoke your pride, Moved you to show him scornâ Mab. Alas! alas! Lyd. With bitter raillery I told the tale I had invented where I knew 'twould gain Admission to his ear: the effect you know. Mab. Wake me! I cannot bear this dream. Oh, wake me! Will none of you have pity? Lyd. More remains. This letter will tell all. [Gives letterâMabel takes the letter mechanically.] Mabel, my niece, In deep remorse, in guilty agony, I pray you to forgive me! [Kneeling. Mab. [Passionately.] Hence! your presence Tortures my eyes, as have your deeds my heart! Lyd. Niece! child! turn not away. I will be heard! I loved you ever. When I wronged you most, My sin was born of love. So high my aims And hopes for you, I could not brook you wed, Save where to every human excellence Was added all the world accounts most noble. And now these tears, this soft and plenteous dew Speak not an arid soilâa stony heart. After my long and weary pilgrimage, I clasp thy feet, a humbled penitent! Mab. IâIâO God, send tears! Lyd. Ah, Mabel, thinkâ We both are dying womenâthink that you May need forgiveness too! [Lydia still kneels at Mabel's feet, who slowly bends forward, and puts her arms round her neck. Mab. [Falteringly.] You are forgiven. Lyd. Bless you! Death will be gentler now. Farewell! [Kisses Mabel's hand, then goes to Earl and kneels.] Brother? Earl. Yes, I'll not add to other misery That of repulsing penitence. Now go: You need rest, and must take it. Attendant enters, and supports Lady Lydia from scene. Earl. The tale so long discredited was true. Mordaunt is wronged. Mab. I ruined and disgraced! Earl. [After a pause.] It shall be done. Down, down, rebellious pride! What's pride when set by love? What price too great To save my dear one's life?âGive me the letter. [Takes letter from Mabel. Mab. What mean you? for your look is strange; you tremble! Earl. No, no; the strife is passed. O God! that we, Whom thy one breath can prostrate utterly, Should dare to foster pride! Mab. [Starting to her feet.] You would see Mordaunt! Earl. Yes, I will see himâsupplicate his ear For this most sad mischance. My prayers and tears Will surely reach his heart. I'll bend my knee, And wear a look so meek, so lowlyâ Mab. Never! Earl. Oh, yes; and he will pardon all the past. Mab. My path of desolation nears the grave; Yet can I turn my face to him once more, And look on him forgivingly. I know That he has been deceived, and I forgive him. He might have pardoned me; but he chose vengeance, And left the print of shame on my crushed heart; Yet wrung not from its depths one sigh of pain. My misery has been silent. Oh, dear father, Torture it not to speech! Earl. Be calm, my child. Mab. Then go you not. Bow not your reverend head In unavailing shame, nor let him know What cause has sped me hence. It shall not be! Your handâa sudden weakness. [Mabel sinks into the chairâthe Physician, kneeling, supports her. Earl. Alas! emotion has o'ertaxed her strength! Phy. I will attend her. Meanwhile, my dear lord, If your good purpose hold, seek Mordaunt straight. Show him the letter. His mind, once convinced, May prompt him to contrition, and such signs Of penitent affection as shall win Your daughter's heart to love of life again. Earl. And yet I fear I go on a vain errand; For should he yield, to o'ercome her resolve Will be a task more hard. Phy. We're in a strait Of peril that admits no other hope. I do conjure you go, and please you bid Your daughter's maid attend to share my watch. Earl. You counsel right, my friend. I go. Farewell. Phy. Almighty aid be with you. [Earl goes out. Her eyelids open. She revives.âDear lady! Mab. Who speaks? Where am I? Phy. 'Tis I, your faithful friend, who watch by you. Enter Attendant. Mab. Thanks, sir. Where is my father. Call him hither! Phy. Affairs of moment took him hence awhile. Mab. Is he within? He has not left the house? Phy. Soon to return. Mab. 'Twas strange he did not wait till I revived, Nor stayed to say farewell. [Weeps.] 'Tis not his wont To quit me thus abruptly.âI remember, He spoke of seeing Mordaunt! [Attendant advances. Heard you the Earl's command? Which way went he? Att. [Hesitatingly.] Madam, I think to Richmond. Mab. [Rises.] Quick! a carriage! Then wait me in my chamber. [Attendant goes out. Check surprise; I must set forth and overtake the Earl. Phy. 'Tis madness! Think not that your shattered frame Could undergo such trial of its strength! Mab. The feelings that inspire the deep resolve, Can grant the strength for action. I must go. Phy. You will forgive me if I countermand Your order lately given. [Going. Mab. Stay! stay! [Supporting herself by chair. 'Tis to preserve my father and myself From scorn, from ignominy, from repulse, I venture on this errand. Oh, just Heaven! It will be thought we have devised some feint To move this proud man's heart. In vain, in vain, My father will implore. One word of mine Would spare himâsave his honoured head from shame! Do you deny me? Think you that my life Is not more perilled by your present act Than by my own design? What, not moved yet? Behold me take the suppliant's attitude. [Kneels. I do implore you in all humbleness To let me now depart.âYou will not yet? [Rises. I claim my right of motionâtrample on All counsel that prescribes subservience From the soul to its poor vassal. I command You let me pass forthwith. You dare not brave me. Phy. [Aside.] What supernatural anger fires her eye! She's right. More danger lies in opposition.â Madam, your will has way. Mab. Thanks, thanks, my friend. In a short time you'll join me. Thanks! No help. [Mabel goes out rapidly, followed by Physician. SCENE II. Mordaunt's House, as in Act I. Enter Mordaunt. Mor. I know not whence or wherefore there has come This woman's weakness o'er my yielding will? What have I done but given pride to learn That as our Maker stamps no mark of caste, Except the soul's, on men; so by their souls, Not by their birth or fortunes, men shall rank! [A short pause. Why am I not at peace? What whispers me That right was never vindicated yet By wrong returned; or, if Heaven work out good By men of wrath, its blessing crowns the deed, But not the doer. Whyâwhy will the thought, Perchance she may have loved me, thus intrude? Can I have sought revenge and called it justice? Enter Servant. Ser. The Earl of Lynterne. Enter the Earl. Servant goes out. Earl. Pardon, Sir Edgar, that I venture thus To break on your retirement: but my cause Is one that outruns all respect of forms. Mor. A country's servant knows no privacy That bars consideration of her weal. I pray you sit, my lord. Earl. My errand is not public. 'Tis not now The minister who claims your patient ear, But a plain sorrowing man, whose wounded heart Your skill alone can solace. To be brief, I am a father; let that word tell all. Mor. The father of a daughter! Is it well We should discourse of her? Earl. Tell me that you permit it. May I speak? Mor. Of her, my lord, or any other stranger, If mention of a name delight your ear. Earl. And you will bear with meâyou will be patient? Mor. Why should I not? What man is there so well Can bear the verbal history of wrong As he who has it written on his heart? If you recite the past, you will not grave The inward record deeper. And its trace Endures, though you be silent. Earl. Oh, sir, repulse me not, for love of mercy. Say that you retain some gentle thought, Some tender recollectionâ Mor. Of your daughter? My lord, she has my pity. Earl. What! No more? [A pause. Ah, sir, I have watched Mabel many a time, When accident, or as it now seems, purpose Long held you from her presence,âquit her chair, And by the hour watch in love's deep suspense, Pale, fixed, and muteâa very statue then; But when the tramp of your approaching horse Broke on her earâfor that love-quickened sense Anticipated sightâshe woke to life, As though your safety gave her leave to be, Rushed forth to meet you, but stopped bashfully To wait your entrance with downcast lids, Which vainly tried to hide the lucid joy Floating, like sunshine, in the orbs beneath! Mor. What is your story's sequel? What succeeds? Earl. You loved her once! Mor. I did, and since it pleases you, I speak. It shall be to such purpose as to wring, Even from your confession, that my act Was one of justice, not of cruelty. I loved her once! Ay, she was then to me The incorporated spirit of all good. My soul's once science was to study her; Her eyes were all my light, her voice my music, Her movements all I cared to know of grace. Loved her! 'Twas worship! 'Twas idolatry! And how was I repaid! The meanest man Who has nor wealth, nor talent, nor distinction, Giving his heart, proffers the dearest gift His Maker gave to himâa gift that merits, Even when not accepted, gratitude! I gave my heart, my mind, unto your daughter, Of which she feigned acceptance, not by words, But by confession far more eloquent. I pressed the love she favoured; she repulsed it; She trampled on it! It was glowing fire; She trod it into ashes! Earl. It was not so; but hear me. Mor. 'Tis too late. Earl. [Rises.] I do implore you, then, to read this letter. [Mordaunt takes letter, rises, and reads it apart. Mor. If this be true, it must pronounce me guilty; And my own eyes bear witness 'gainst my heart! A life-time's love would not atone my sin. Can I, indeed, have wronged her thus? Enter Servant announcing âThe Lady Mabel Lynterne!â Mabel enters and rushes to the Earl. Servant goes out. Mab. My father! Earl. My child!â[To Mordaunt.] Read there the answer to your doubt. Mor. 'Tis evidence that stabs, while it convicts. Why knew I not this sooner? O Mabel, how I've wronged thee! [Kneels to her. Mab. What words are these? I came here to forbid Vain supplication to a haughty heart, And lo! I find one meek and penitent. And thou dost love me, Mordaunt? Mor. [Rising.] Love thee, Mabel! My careworn heart revives at sight of thee, And hoards the life 'twas weariness to keep. How now! thou tremblest, sweet! Mab. Love! aid me to my chair; My strength is failing fast; I am as one Who has striven hard to distance Grief, and gained The goal before her, my strength but sufficing To win the triumph. Mordaunt, I shall die With thy love for my chaplet, and in peace! Mor. [Kneeling by her side.] And thou wilt live in peace for many years! [Aside.] What demon gives my fear-struck heart the lie? Mab. I've much to say, and but brief time to speak it. Thou knowest now I love thee; but thou canst notâ Thou canst not tell how deeply. That our lips Should so belie our hearts! Couldst thou read mine! Mor. Or thou read mine; the thoughts of agony Remorse sears on it with a brand of fire! Mab. Oh, couldst thou know how often in my walks My soul drank gladness from the thought that thou Wouldst share them with me, and the beautiful Grow brighter as thy voice interpreted Its hidden loveliness; and our fireside! How I should greet thee from the stormy war Of public conflict, kneel beside thy chair, And cause thee bend thine eyes on mine, until Thy brow expanded, and thy lips confessed The blessedness of home! Mor. Home, sayest thou? Home! Home! That's the grave. Mab. My fate is gentler, love, Than I had dared to hope. I shall not live Encircled by thine arms; but I may die so. [Sinks back. Mor. [Rising and turning away.] I cannot bear it; Oh, I cannot bear it. Fool! Not to know the vengeance of forgiveness! Earl. You see, sir, that the wound is deep enough. Mab. Nay, speak not harshly; for in noble minds Error is suffering, and we should soothe The breast that bears its punishment within. Tell me that you forgive him. Do not pause. Stint not the affluent affection now, That hitherto outran my need in grantingâ All dimly floats before me. While I yet Can hear your voice, tell me that you forgive him! [Mabel has now raised herself, and stands erect. Earl. I do, I do! Mab. Now take him to your arms, And call him son. Earl. Thou art obeyed:âMy son! Mor. [Advancing.] My father! [Mabel joins their hands. Mab. I am happyâvery happy! [She falls into Mordaunt's armsâa short pauseâshe dies. END OF THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER.</field>
