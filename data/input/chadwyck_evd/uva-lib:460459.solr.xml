      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enobarbus and Demetrius. Dem. Not send to him, say you? Enob. Noâhe's at his pleasures; and that's the business of the life of Antony. It were treason to disturb him. Dem. Then let the world run loose, and all things fall Into their first confusion!âHere I come Dispatch from Rome, with tidings that might shake him, Though he were pillar'd as the base of Atlas! Enob. I tell you, my worthy friend, while Antony and Cleopatra are at their revels, though every minute were hung with the weight of a province, and every province were to drop in the want of attentionâthey would laugh, and call the music. Dem. Antony cannot, sure, be so unsoldier'd; So deeply an Egyptian!âI do tell you, His half of this great world, in monstrous cantlets, Falls hourly from his graspâThere's not a day, But, in the want of a more powerful hand, Or wiser head to rule, some new adventurer Starts up to signiorshipâAll, all is faction, All broil and lawless contest; where the scum, As in a heated cauldron, boils to the top, And gives us up the vilest of the vile, To station and command.âYou must awake him! Enob. Not I, by my troth; let him e'en take his nap out. Why, what is Antony to me, more than the world to Antony? Dem. I am not known to him; but they do say, 'Twere pity of him!âa most generous master, A free companion, and a stedfast friend; And, as they tell me too, for soldiership, He stands up peerless! Enob. The truth is, were he half as wise of his head, as he is valiant of his hands, you should not meet his fellow in a ride of five leagues.âOr, did he love the Commonwealth of Rome, with the tythe of the passion he has for an Egyptian petticoat, I would not exchange him, in the article of government,âno, not for the monarch, whom Jupiter, in his bounty, sent to the frogs. Dem. He must not then be lost.âI tell thee, friend, He has not fifty followers left in Rome; And they but wait, or his, or my return, With their joint interests to support his state, Or let him tumble! Enob. Well, well; in a week or so, if we can get him apart, we may work wonders. Dem. A week?âI will not bide a day, an hour. I'll back to Rome, and rid me of my errand! I'll let his friends all know their false dependence! Enob. Patience!âthe man is not really so much to blame, as those may imagine who have their wits about them. He is fettered to Afric with a stronger chain than that which holds Enceladus. Not all the filtres, which the hags of Thessaly compound beneath the moon, may compare with the power of this Egyptian sorceress. Nor was the invisible net, in which the strong god of war was taken, half so subtle as that, in which my master Antony is now entangled. Dem. 'Tis strange and pitiful; and so, farewell To my commission! Enob. You are so hastyâa little longer now, I pray you!âStay but till you see this wonder of a woman, that you may have somewhat to talk of when you grow old.âThey are but out in the bay, and are now on their return.âBut hark! a post comes in. [A horn sounds, Post enters. Whence are you, fellow? Post. From Parthia, to my lord. Enob. What is the news? Post. The pacquet tells. [Gives a bundle. Enob. Without, thenâkeep in waiting. [Horn sounds, Post enters. And you, from whence? Post. From Sicily, with letters to the emperor. Enob. I shall remember.â Wait within hearing.âHere's thick news, Demetrius. Another!â [Horn sounds, Post enters. Post. This for the emperor. [Delivers a pacquet. Enob. From whence, I pray you? Post. From Sicyon, with deep tidings. Enob. The emperor is at hand.âStep you apart, And tarry within call. Dem. That they should come thus thick, each upon other! 'tis wonderful. Enob. The custom, sir, the custom. They come thus hourly; even as the winds, from all quarters, and as little regarded. The minions of Cleopatra take in the several pacquets, from states, islands, empires; and with these she curls her hair, or sends them in hampers to her cooks, to put under the pies, and keep the venison from scorching.âBut look, Demetrius! See where they come!âThe golden Cleopatra and her Antony, booming, like Amphitrite and her Neptune, down the spring-tide of pleasure! SCENE II. Antony, Cleopatra, and Attendants, are discovered in a splendid galley; soft flutes playing. They sail down to the front of the stage, and then go off through the side wings. Enobarbus and Demetrius converse apart. Enob. Step you aside, Demetrius, while I prepare for your audience. [Exit Demetrius. Antony and Cleopatra, with Attendants. Cleo. I know ye, I know ye. The loves of men are fitfull; And while the fever's on, your oaths would pluck The planets from their orbs!â If you do love, indeed,âtell me how much? Ant. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd. Cleo. I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved. Ant. Then you must needs find out new heavens, new earth! Enob. Emperor! Cleo. 'Tis Enobarbus.â He callsâGo to him, my lord. Ant. Psha!âmark him not. Enob. Antony! Ant. Ha!âwho names Antony? Enob. I say, Mark Antony!âIt was once a name, that neither the first CÃ¦sar, nor the Macedonian son of Jove, ought to have been ashamed of! Ant. What say'st thou, Enobarbus? Enob. We are begirt with messengers, posted from every corner of the globe. Ant. It grates me!âBid 'em wait. Cleo. Nay, hear 'em, Antony; There may be danger else!â Perhaps the beardless Cynic, the boy CÃ¦sar, Has summon'd you from hence, and cries, âCome Antony! âOr else we damn thee.â Ant. How, my love! Cleo. Call in the messengers.âAs I am Egypt's Queen, Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine Is CÃ¦sar's homager.âThe messengers! Ant. No messengers, I say! Let Rome in Tyber melt, and the wide arch Of the rais'd empire fall!âWhy live the gods, But to enjoy? A world of care had not been worth my winning; Did it not give a Cleopatra to me, I'd cast it to the kites for carrion. Enob. Emperor! Ant. No more!â Enob. You sleep upon the brink! Ant. No more, I charge you! Cleo. Soft, soft, my lord; Pay meet submission to authority. Trust me, the brow of your stern monitor Begins to darken. Ant. On occasion, love, The bluntness of a friend does not dislike me: Amid the palling of a thousand flatterers, A little poignancy of truth, at times, Is not unwholesome seasoning. Cleo. But then he looks on us with such a woefulness of face, as though he had been brought forth among the tombs.âSure as the flowing of Nilus, were I given to the sadness and sullenness of philosophy, I would keep this same scare-crow, like the mournful memento of a death's head, always before meâ Will you give him to me, Antony? Ant. Ay, my Queen, take him! Though his honesty should prove useless, his folly will be diverting. Cleo. When that martial beard of his shall be quaintly razor'd, he will make the prettiest kind of Ganimede for paging a lady's toilet! Ant. Come, love!âwhat sport to night? Cleo. Nay, but in earnest, call the ambassadors. Ant. Fye, wrangling Queen! Whom every thing becomes; to laugh, to weep, To chide, to jest! Who mint the misbeseemings of all others To graces and adornments! Thou art, thyself, the world of Antony, Summ'd up of all that nature can afford Of price or rarity! Within thy presence, time, and occupation, Should taste of nought but pleasure.âLet us forth, And, in a round of varied frolicks, mock The gravity of the age. Cleo. Pray you now, my Antony, First, give the world its answer, and then let's to play. Ant. Then be it so. Go, Enobarbus, bring in your obtruders. Enob. With speed, and a special good will! [Exit Enobarbus. Cleo. Now I think on't again, it were matter of pretty merriment to leave this soldierly politician and his messengers in a maze.âHow he will fume and swear! Ant. Excellent sport!âaway. Bliss crown the night, and frolic rule the day! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Enobarbus and Demetrius. Enob. Hey!âWhat's tow'rd us now, I trow? âAll gone, all vanish'd! The devil and his seductions! Dem. OâI do see, 'tis hopeless allâHe is lost! He drowns, and dashes back the officious hands Who risque themselves to save him!âRest you happy! I'll straight aboard. Enob. But this one day, this hour; indulge me yet, I pray you. Though she bury him in the catacombs, or cover him up under a pyramid of her plackets, I'll find and fetch him to you, trust me. Dem. It matters notâPerdition on 'em both! CÃ¦sar and Antony! How this great vessel of the world does reel, Beneath such rulers!âWas it then for these, That the great Tully spoke, that Cato bled, And our last Brutus struck? Enob. Nay, nayâif the people cannot chuse but call out for burdens, I pray the gods they may be properly blister'd. There was that very honest hearted, but silly headed fellow, call'd Brutus, whom you mentionedâhe, forsooth, must impose liberty upon his countrymen against their wills. But, we paid him off for his impertinence, and have given a future caveat to all such undertakers. Dem. Gods, gods!âO Rome, O honour!âWhere, my friend, Where is our country now? All swallow'd up, In the wide ocean of unpaled licentiousness That deluges mankind!âShew me but one Roman, One of the ancient stamp, of the old metal, And I will pay my worship to the wonder, And bend as to some god!âBut, for this Antony, He, of all Romans, is the most degenerate, The deepest sunk from virtue. Enob. You wrong him, Demetrius, you wrong him, by the gods! Twice has he doubled the exploits of the great Xenophon, in the celebrated retreat of his ten thousand Greeks; through Parthia, once; and once, when conquering, though conquer'd, he slew the consuls Hirtius and Pansa. Dem. I have heard of this. But his late foils have dimm'd his former glories. Enob. But not extinguish'd, Demetrius.âHad you but seen him, covering his little band, even under his own courage! travelling through hostile tracts, attended and begirt with a multitude of his enemies; deserts before him, famine at his heels, and all the elements in confederacy against him!â Why, man, he browzed like the roe upon leaves and bark, and quaffed the puddle that turned the very oxen to loathing!âYet his cheek lanked not. By Jupiter, I think his step grew the firmer, and the brow of his captainship more chearly elevated!â We had nothing to live upon, but the confidence and love that we catch'd from his looks; and his courage served us all for armour and encampment. Dem. Pity, pity, pity! Had he been born one hundred years ago, He were indeed a Roman! Enob. And then, the sweetest companionâthat ever taught philosophy to play the fool! It were your loss of a happy remembrance, to depart without knowing him. But, aptly, here he comes. SCENE V. Antony enters. Enob. My lord, permit me to recommend the young Demetrius to your notice. He has been long on his travels, in search of knowledge, and the virtues practised of old; and is but lately returned to the bosom of his country. Ant. You are welcome, sir, to EgyptâEgypt, too, Was once the seat of science.âHave you aught From Rome, I pray you? Dem. Letters, my lord, from Philo, Proculeius, Decretas, Scarus, and the rest, your fast, But much alarmed friends. [Gives a pacquet. Ant. These, in their time. [Puts up the letters. What, of yourself, do you knowâ The latest news, I pray? Dem. Sextus is lord of Sicily, and the sea; And, in the swell of his great father's name, Steps forth, as who should say, I would be foremost. Ant. A trifle yet. What more? Dem. The nature of bad news infects the teller. Ant. When it concerns the fool, or coward! Things that are past, are done with meâ'Tis thus: Who tells me truth, though in the tale lie death, I hear, as if he flatter'd!âOn, I pray you. Dem. Albania and Iberia have revolted; And the new king, the potent Artuasdes, Lord of Armenia, now disdains the yoke Of Antony and Rome! Ant. Amid a world, a few reluctant kingdoms May well be spared, or soon retrieved.âWhat worse? Dem. So may the gods restore, as, like a god, You hear of damages immense.âKnow, then, The half of your great eastern world is lost! The traitor Labienus joins the Parthian; And, from Euphrates west, hath spread his banners, Through Syria, even to Lydia and Ionia; Whilstâ Ant. Whilst Antonyâyou would say. Dem. O, my good lord!â Ant. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongueâ Name Cleopatra, as she is called in Rome; And taunt my faults with such full scope, as truth Or malice might suggest. Dem. The worst of tidings Is, that your marriage with the Queen of Egypt, Has lost you almost all the hearts of Rome. 'Tis said, That matching thus, you have divorced your country, And sunk her greatness in your own dishonour! Ant. Proud, proud Romans!âNow, ye gods! be witness, 'Tis Cleopatra has debased herself, In wedding aught beneath your own immortals! Not my great ancestor, the famed Alcides, No, nor his father Jove, were ever pair'd Like Antonyâfor nature rein'd her powers, And spared her excellence, to lavish all On the bright daughter of the house of Lagos!â But comeâWe will indulge them in their envy. The world that wills not I should taste of quiet, Shall reck my being rouzed. Enobarbus! Enob. Your pleasure, sir? Ant. We must, with haste, from hence! Enob. Why then, look ye, sir, we kill all our womenâ If we talk of departure, death is the word! Ant. Light answers fit not now.âLet our chief officers Have notice of our purposeâI shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen, And must have leave to part. Enob. The gods are lavish! [Exit Enobarbus. SCENE VI. Enter Cleopatra, Mardian, Alexas, Charmian, Iras, &amp;c. Ant. Loth am I to give breathing to my purpose. Cleo. Now do I know, by that same Roman there, There's some new colour found, to varnish falsehood. You would be goneâis it not so, Mark Antony? Why came you hither, to betray fond hearts, With mouth-made vows, that break themselves in binding? Let not the Romans say, 'tis I that keep youâ I have no power upon you! Ant. The gods can witnessâ Cleo. Nayâpray you, seek no colour for your going, But bid farewell, and go.âWhen you sued staying, Then was your time for wordsâNo going, thenâ Eternity was in our lips and eyes, Bliss in our lifted brow; no part so poor, But was the breed of heavenâThey are so still; Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, Art turned the greatest lyar. Ant. Will you hear me? The strong necessity of the time commands My services awhile.â Cleo. I know, I know it. That you have staid so long, there rests the wonder. For what are Roman oaths, tho' nail'd in heaven? I would it pleas'd the gods I might rejoice; For you and I must partâbut that's not it. Yet you and I have lovedâbut that's not it. Perhaps you knowâSomething it is I would, But cannotâ O me!âOblivion is a very Antony, And I am all forgotten. Ant. Quarrel no more; but, like yourself, support What fate lays on usâBy the living fire, That lights up nature! I do go from hence, Your husband, soldier, servant, making peace Or war, as you affect. Cleo. Ah, Antony! Have I another lord to guard my weakness? Or where, else, shall my orphan'd little ones Look out to find a father?âBut, no matter! Your honour, sir, your honour calls you hence,â Therefore be deaf to our unpitied wailings; And all the gods go with you!âOn your sword Sit laurel'd victory, and smooth success Be strew'd before your feet! Ant. Oâthen I feel, 'Tis time to break at once; or we are both, Both lost, for ever! [Going, Cleopatra suddenly throws herself on one knee, and catches his robe. Cleo. Ah! would you, Would you, indeed?âWould you then leave me, Antony? Ant. But for a season, dearest!âto return, With rapture multiplied.â Even as the bow, when strain'd against the temper, Shoots swifter to its mark! Cleo. I could not bear itâ Fancy was not prepared for such a ruin! You will notâmust not,âcannot!â Ant. Help, Demetrius! She winds about my heart!âHelp, Enobarbus! An engine grapples me at every limb, And every engine is a Cleopatra. Cleo. Do, cruel Romans, wrench him, tear him from me. Fly, Charmian, call my children to assist me! [Exit Charmian. Since that the cords of love are not of force, Let those of nature bind you!âBring my children. Ant. Great father Hercules, confirm your offspring! SCENE VII. Charmian enters with Alexander and Cleopatra. They run to them. Cleo. Will you not kiss your play-fellows, my Antony? One parting farewell from your Cyprian Queen, And little Macedonian?âCome, my prattlers, Help me to hold a truant husband here! Alex. We'll warrant you, mother.âDo you go on one side, Patty, and I'll keep on t'other; and, if he offers to stir, we'll hang to him like a pair of bobbins. Ant. Oh!âif there are fathers hereâ They will excuse me! Cleo. There bind him fast, and chain me down this Mars, Even with the links of his paternal love, Forged on the vital anvil of his heart! Ant. Shame, shame on manhood!âinfants overmatch The force of Antony. Cleo. Why shame, great sir? Were you the Jove, and seated on Olympus, Could your Latona bring to your embraces, A brighter pair than these? Ant. No!âYe are all my pride, and all my empire! Demetrius, flout not at a soldier's feelings. 'Tis such a love, as I do bear to these, That binds the world together.âBut O, my Queen, Our world is rent therebyâwe have loved away Kingdoms and provinces; and now the spot I press, is haply all that's left on earth Of Antony's domain! Trumpets sound, Eros enters. Eros. Tidings, great emperor!â Your lieutenant, Sossius, has reduced the two kingdoms of Iberia and Albania to your obedience, and sends you the crown'd heads of the two revolted monarchs. Ant. Then we are still a king! Trumpets. Scarus enters. Scar. Tidings, most mighty Antony!âYour lieutenant, Canidius, has recovered all Armenia; and sends, to adorn your triumph, their boasted monarch, the haughty Artuasdes, with one thousand of his nobles, in chains of gold. Trumpets. Three Messengers enter. 1st Mess. Hail, emperor! the traitor Labienus, With his apostate host of recreant Romans, Lies in the field of death.âSo sends Ventidius. 2d Mess. Hail, glory of the Roman name!âPacorus Takes his last sleep in Syria, and the ghost Of Crassus is appeas'd. So sends Ventidius. 3d Mess. Hail, sovereign of the earth!âWe bring, from Parthia, Rome's captive honours, and her drooping eagles, With twenty scepter'd hands, in golden shackles, And half the treasures of the gorgeous East. This sends the great Ventidius. Ant. Soâfortune's in the mood to save us trouble, And leaves but little of the world to win.â Proclaim for Sossius and Canidius, each, Through Alexandria, a three days ovation! But, for Ventidius, a full jubilee, And triumph of a moon!âTo all our friends We destine realms, rich tracts, and fair domains; To all our servants gifts; to all our slaves Enfranchisement. Cleo. The Jove of affluent heaven Alone can match the bounty of our emperor, His substitute on earth! Ant. High in the center of the market-place, Set me two thrones of gold, where we may crown This sun and moon, our son and daughter here, Twin emblems of the two bright luminaries, That light the world.â Our Alexander here, we do create King of Armenia, Media, and PhÃ¦nice, And CÅlosyria. Our filial Cleopatra here, we crown Queen of the blest Arabia, breathing odours; And of the Cytherean isle of Cyprus, Devote and sacred to the power of beauty. Cleo. Let heralds trumpet, through the lands of Egypt, That, for the space of one and thirty days, All occupation cease: during that term, I feast the nation. Ant. Demetrius, does your purpose bend to Rome, Or would you stay, and share our power in Egypt? Dem. My noble lord, I am, as you were, once, My country's propertyâI must to Rome. Ant. Should you e'er seek a friend, look on this toyâ It will instruct your search! [Gives a jewel. Dem. Most bounteous Antony! May I be warranted, without offence, To tell you bold, but wholesome tidings? Ant. Speak!â It were a task, at such a time as this, To put us to ill temper. Dem. Your colleague, CÃ¦sar, and the senate, talk Of citing you to Rome; and, on refusal, To vote you shorn of all your governments, And the arch enemy of the state. Ant. Cite me?âThe foe they vote me, they shall find me. Should your grey beards presume to scan my conduct, I shall not fear, no more than Julius did, To pass the RubiconâSo tell the boy Octavius. When Rome shall dare to whisper such a sentence. Expect me at your gates! [Exeunt. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enobarbus, Agrippa, and Roman Nobles. Agrip. Where will you find mouths for all those victuals? Enob. They are all for the royal table I assure you, my friend. Why, gentlemen, we have fourscore and sixteen kitchens, each larger than a court of justice; and, by the quarter of the hour, in regular succession, each kitchen is provided with a feast for a thousand, hot fuming from spits, pans, kettles, stews, ovens, and cauldrons, that the service may never fail, or come in coldly, when appetite or humour shall please to call. Our liquor flows, plenteous as the Nile in its swell; and Alexandria is fed from the refuse of our table. Agrip. You did not live thus, in your retreat through Parthia. Enob. True, Agrippa. And these, your gentlemen of the summer nobility, will like our Egyptian fare somewhat better than following my master Antony over the Alps, and living upon sallads dug out of the snow. Agrip. All my appetite is in my eyes. I long to feast them on your Cleopatra. Enob. Ay, Agrippa! she, indeed, is the dish of dishesâsuch as never shall come to table again, till nature shall provide a new service of women. Agrip. Where, pray you, did Antony first meet with her? Enob. In Cilicia. She had given aid to Cassius; and Antony sent for her in high dudgeon, to answer many charges preferred against her. If I were not unhappy at description, I would give you the manner of it. Agrip. Any how. Nobl. Any how. Agrip. Let us have it, we beseech you. Enob. Why, she came down the river Cydnus, in a galley, whose poop and sides were inlaid with burnished gold, and appeared to whiz and burn along the water. The oars were silver, and kept stroke to the sound of flutes and hautboys. The sails were of Tyrian purple, the tackle of silk; and the streamers, like flaming meteors, seemed to kindle the very gales that came to cool them.â But, as for herself, I shall say nothing; for, though I hate her more heartily than ever I loved my mother, yet I would not do her injustice.âShe beggars description. Agrip. Nay, good now, Enobarbus!âas I am a Roman you tell it rarely. All. Rarely, rarely! Enob. Under a canopy of golden tissue, whose curtains were thrown aloft, she lay, carelessly reclined, out-picturing the goddess, whose picture is said to have out-copied nature. Her wenches, dressed like Nereids or the Graces of the Ocean, here steered the helm, here handled the cordage, and here shifted the silken sails: while boys, quivered and winged like dimpled Cupids, kept fanning off the air that kindled at her cheek. In her eye was glory, and in her smile fascination. The city threw forth all its people upon her, and left Antony alone on his tribunal in the marketplace, whistling after the wind, that flew to meet Cleopatra. Agrip. Why your account is enough to empty Rome also, and bring Italy into Egypt! Nobl. All to Egypt, all to Egypt! Agrip. But, is it certain that your emperor is married to this wonder? Enob. As sure as an Egyptian priest can fetter him. Agrip. An Antony, however, can never be bound to any thing, save his liking; and he, you know, is an inconstant, and a voluptuary. Enob. I tell the, Agrippa, inconstancy itself must be a captive to Cleopatra. Age cannot wither, nor custom make common her infinite perfections. Agrip. I grieve to hear this.âI came, commissioned by CÃ¦sar, to propose terms of lasting amity; and to offer his sister, Octavia, pre-eminent in every excellence, to Antony for wife. Enob. I am glad you come not to threaten; for our late successes have put us on so broad a bottom, that we think we stand firm against the fates.âBut here comes the emperorâI would confer with you of these matters, preparatory to your introduction. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Antony enters, with young Alexander and Cleopatra fondling on each side. Ant. Away, ye little rogues, ye wanton varlets! Away, I am not in the humour now, To wrestle with your fondnessâ To ride the may-rods, or to roll the slope, Or play at marble pelletsâHence, ye roguelings! I am not in the vein. Alex. Sister! Do you take hold of one leg, while I take hold Of t'other, and then I'll warrant you! Cleo. Now, Ally, now!â I lay a good round wager we have him down! Ant. There now, I am down already. [Sits. What would ye more?âHow dare you use me thus? Know ye not I'm an emperor? Alex. Yes, yesâbut, father, What matters being an emperor? Ant. What matters, sirrah?â Marry, and that's a pregnant question too! What matters?âwhy, to wear a crown, as I do. Cleo. Don't believe him, brother. I'll tell you what's to be an emperorâ It is to speak big words, and to be strong, And to throw others down, as we throw him. Alex. Then, Patty, we are stronger than an emperor. Ant. Indeed, and that's true too. SCENE III. To them enters Cleopatra. Cleo. What, have my little teizers got about you? Ant. Yes, like the careless kids, and fleecy younglings, Their play is ready at all hours; in that They overmatch meâO, my Cleopatra, I think it is not sickness, nor ill temper, Yet something is upon meâ'Tis that kind Of soothing weight, wherein the eye looks round, Desirous of some cause that might excuse The folly of its melting. Cleo. A morning vapour!âor, perhaps, the weight Of these successes, piled so largely on us! For the great mind may better rouze itself Against the shock and brunt of evil fortune. Ant. Did I indulge the Sybil in my breast, I should imagine some event at hand, Of fatal portance.â'Tis, as though some power, Intelligent of things, should whisper here, The years of Antony have run their round.â A tear, my love?âI meant not to alarm Thy tenderness of nature.âSoon, or late, All will have endingâand the happiest life, That e'er was granted to humanity, Must have a tragic close! Cleo. Prevent the sense of such an hour, ye gods! Rather strike now, and lay me down in death! O Antony, love's lord! Live I, or these, our precious little ones, Save on thy looks, our daily nourishment? Is not thine aspect as yon heavenly sun, That gives these tender flowers to ope their sweets, And lift their fragrant heads? Ant. No more, no more! Anticipation is a greater evil, Than aught that may befall. Who fears not fate, Scarce feels it.â The gods may yet have many rolling years, Of love and empire stored for us, and these The pride of their productions! SCENE IV. Enobarbus enters. Enob. My lord,âAgrippa, and a train of noblemen, of the first note in Rome, petition to be admitted to your presence. Ant. What, do they come to cite us to their senate-house? Enob. No, my good lord,âthey touch an humbler key. They come, deputed by CÃ¦sar and the conscript fathers, to congratulate you on your conquests over Parthia and the East. Ant. We will attend themâCome, my matchless pair Of priceless pearls, we'll shew these saucy Romans, Our stay in Egypt hath a nobler issue, Than their proud Italy can boast! [Exeunt Antony, Enobarbus, and Children. SCENE V. To Cleopatra, Alexas, Mardian, Charmian, Iras, &amp;c. Alexas. Madam, the royal captive of Armenia Implores permission to unfold a matter, Touching your crown and honour. Cleo. Admit him. SCENE VI. Artuasdes enters in Chains of Gold. Cleo. A presence that bespeaks us.âNoble sir, The lot of war is not the test of worthâ The task of virtue is not to controul, But bear our fortune.âWould you aught with us? Art. Yes, lady. Cleo. You are, as we are told, Armenia's monarch, The valiant Artuasdes. Art. Once, a monarch. Cleo. He, of that name, who lately bore the scepter, Was near to us in blood.âWas he your sire? Art. No, madam. Cleo. They say you have a matter to reveal, Touching ourselves. Art. Nearly. Cleo. Unfold, I pray you. Art. To none but Cleopatra. Cleo. Leave us! [Her attendants go out. âNow, sir!â But let me not precipitate your purpose,â Your frame appears to labour with some secret, Too big for birth! Art. O Cleopatra! Cleo. SpeakâWhat, man, in tears? Speakâwe have power, and are not void of pity. Art. For you, for you they fall.âO, fairest page Of the world's volume, how art thou become A blot to every eye! Thou shame and glory of the house of Lagos! Sweet flower of nature's field!âO pity, pity!â So cropt and cast abroad. Cleo. Opprobrious ruffian!âBut, thine head shall pay The trespass of thy tongue. Art. My head?âhow gladly! So that my blood might wash thy stains away. Cleo. Yet I am patientâCome, unfold thy slanders. For which of our offences hast thou dared To cast dishonour on us? Art. Art thou not harlot to the Antony? What, though he be the foremost man on earthâ Were he the first of all the gods in heaven, Yet the bright heiress of the Ptolemies Were, so, degraded. Cleo. Is that our crime?âbut we excuse thine error, And thank thee for thine interest in our honour. Sayst thou, the harlot of the Antony?â So Rome gives out; for Rome would have it so. But Egypt, and the gods of Nile, do know I am his wedded wife. Art. His wife?âO Isis! Cleo. His wedded, honour'd wife!âBut, who art thou, That with so kindly and so warm a passion, Takest to thee our concerns? Art. First, let me pay this tribute of my joy, To the redemption of thy fame. Cleo. Ha!âSomewhat Would say, thou'rt nearer unto Cleopatra, Than yet she can divine.âWhoâwhenceâwhat art thou? Art. While thou, Arsinoe, and young Ptolemy, Were yet but infants; a conspiracy, In a dark hour, and at one bloody stroke, Meant to cut off the royal line of Egypt. Cleo. True. Art. Your mother, Sister to Artuasdes, then was pregnant; And your sage father, to prevent like treason, In secret sent the infant to Armenia. Cleo. Somewhat of this, but like a dream long laps'd, Occurs to thought.âAnd, lives the royal little one? Art. Perhaps. Cleo. How fated? Art. Not for happy. Cleo. Haply too in bonds.âIs it not so? Art. Know'st thou thy father's character and signet? [Gives a parchment and wax. Cleo. Yes, yes, 'tis Ptolemy's.â My heart, unknowing, took acquaintance with thee. Thou art the son of Lagos.âO, my brother! [Embraces. Art. Ah, Cleopatra! while thy fame was doubtful, I long disdain'd to claim alliance with thee. As ill it now becomes thy royalty, To own these bonds. Cleo. We cancel their disgrace. Ah, how had Egypt sunk with shame eternal, To see the heir of her imperial house, Led through her streets in chains! Art. But, canst thou answer to thy Roman lord This conduct? Cleo. O, doubt it not. He will restore thy kingdom, With regions multiplied.âWhat, Shall I not give a brother to his bosom, A champion to his side?âShall I not give A guardian to our precious little ones? Art. Yes, Cleopatra, a true father to them. Cleo. Wilt thou, my brother?âOnce more, to my arms! And yet, again!âTo thy sole sister, welcome! Dearer than health or fame!âmore rich than empire! Welcome, O welcome, to thy native Egypt, The seat of thy great fathers! [Exeunt. SCENE VII. While Cleopatra and Artuasdes embrace, Antony enters, and stands in mute astonishment till they go out. Ant. Mine eyes are false!âIs that the Queen of Egypt?â So close, and kind, in secret?â Gape hell, and swallow all affiance up, All faith, and trust, and fabled truth, in woman!â Though all the synod of the gods had sworn, I had not believed it.â Alexas! [Alexas passing. Alexas. Sir. Ant. Where is thy mistress? Alexas. I left her here, some time since, with the royal captive of Armenia. Ant. And why didst thou leave her? Alexas. It was her order. Ant. Oh!â Alexas. Is any thing the matter, my lord? Ant. Noânothingâ A slight painâLeave me! Alexas. Sir! Ant. Hence! [Alexas goes out. Is it then so?âor is existence but a doubt Of something, or of nothing, to disturb And turn the brain?â O world, then, world, bid thou adieu to truth, As I to happiness!âWhy,â With what a transport of repeated appetence, The strumpet clasp'd her sturdy paramour, Mindful of former lusts!âOut on her!â Hot, hot, and craving, as the gulph of hell, Is woman's appetite!â She dies!âand I live wretched!âBe it so, She dies, tho' female nature should expire, And human race have ending. Who waits?âScarus! ho, Scarus! SCENE VIII. Scarus enters. Scar. My lord. Ant. There is no other shiftâvengeance!â No other use for lifeâtremendous, sudden!â What,âScarus, I say! Scar. I wait your pleasure, sir. Ant. O, are you there?â I had a thing to orderâStayâI have it.â Dispatch, man!â Build me a scaffold in the market-place, Nine stories high! At which the astonish'd earth may gaze from far, And tremble at our justice! Scar. Might I presume? Ant. Away,âand see it done! [Exit Scarus. But softâhow then, how then? I give the scoffing world to plaud itself, In blaming my long dotage.â Haply, 'tis but the fault of nature in her! All women may be thusâno doubt, no doubtâ And virtue but their skill, for covering naughtinessâ Damn'd, damn'd adulteressâcontaminate to the bone, And the lewd marrow!â O, my poor children!â How has her foulness shed the frost of infamy Upon your blighted heads!âbetter for you, Her shame were partly covered!âWhat, and if I seem to cast the first contempt upon her?â Rightâthis instantâ Quit her in scorn!âto Romeâto Parthiaâany where! Furthest is bestâHo, Enobarbus! [Servant enters. Serv. Call'd you, my lord? Ant. Send Enobarbus to us. [Exit Servant. Whence is this grief to man?âO misery! That he would give you twenty thousand worlds, But for a little truth in one small woman, Yet may not purchase.âCurse her, curse her, curse her! If, after satiate lewdness, she may taste The bitter of remorse,â Be it her daily cup!âInfix, ye furies, Infix your scorpions in her tainted fleshâ Set all her losses, all my wrongs before her, And gnaw her harlot-heart!â SCENE IX. Enobarbus enters. Enob. Did my lord call? Ant. Hast e'er a galley ready? Enob. Yes, as you order'd, the Antonia spreads Her sail for Sicily. Ant. I'll straight aboard. Enob. Aboard, my lord,âwhither? Ant. No matter,âsee that all things be in readiness; [Exit Enobarbus. I'll follow.â But hark! [He re-enters. Enob. My lord! Ant. Ask not, nor answer questions by the way. Dispatch!â [Exit Enobarbus. And dost thou hear? [He returns. Enob. Your pleasure, sir! Ant. Few officers will serveâ And no leave-takingâmark you thatâAway!â [Exit. Yet stayâIf anyâbut it matters not. [He returns. Away, I sayâI follow on the instant! [Exit Enobarbus. Yetâone departing lookâto wring her heart! Once, and no more, for ever!âWho attends? Serv. What would my lord? Ant. Haste, call me back Domitius Enobarbus! Hold!âNoâPerdition on the strumpet! To speak, were to capitulate!â But, O, my little play-fellows! Must I then leave ye? [Herald enters. Her. My lord, ambassadors from several eastern satraps, and the new king ofâ Ant. Damn your ambassadors, Kings, satraps, and their subjects, east and west. Avoid!â [Exit Herald. To go, to partâto leave her here, at large, To the high ramps and broadness of her strumpettingâ 'Twill breed contagions in the very elements; And the hot airs that shall exhale from Egypt, Shall bear her rankness through the world.â To kill, to cool.âAy, thatâ SCENE X. Eros enters. [Ant.] My faithful Eros! Thou comest on the pointâCome hither, Eros! Eros. What would my gracious master? Ant. Canst thou be secret? Eros. As the catacombs. Ant. And do a deedâ Eros. A deed! Ant. Of justice, Eros? Eros. What my lord bids, is justice. Ant. Wouldst thou believe it?â Eros. What? Ant. Nay, by yon blushing sun, I saw it. Eros. Saw it, my master?âWhat, whom, when?â I fly to execute! Ant. Thou hast heard what Julius saidâ The wife of CÃ¦sar should not be suspected. Eros. Wife, my lord, wife!âIs it possible? Ant. Fact, Eros, factâ These eyes beheld them intermingling breaths, And loose embracements. Eros. I was present when she dismiss'd her attendants, To give audience, in private, to the prince of Armenia. Ant. 'Tis so.âHe, he!â One of the quondam servants of her lusts, Whom thus she recognizes.âEros! Eros. My lord! Ant. I would she were at restâ Eros. With her forefathersâis it not? Ant. Ay, Eros. Eros. She shall not see to-morrow's sun. Ant. The manner, fearful!â My hate is now extreme, even as my fondnessâ Blood, blood!â Eros. It shall be so. Ant. The guards are all Pretorianâtake my signetâ [Gives his signet, And this my present! Gives a dagger. Eros. I will give it truely. Ant. To her false heart! Eros. I will.âThe Armenian tooâ Ant. A dungeon for the slave, Till his adulterous flesh rot, piece meal, from him! Eros. Enough. Ant. I must aboard.âAbout it, Eros!â [Exit Eros. Accursed land, I leave thee now for ever. Sink, Egypt! Nile o'erwhelm it, in a flow That never shall have ebb!â Gods, what have I to act!âhow hard the part, Chear in the face, with anguish at the heart! [Exit Antony. SCENE XI. Enter Cleopatra, Artuasdes, Charmian, Iras, &amp;c. Art. The great gods keep him firm, and make him worthy Of all your love and confidence!âBut yet, I doubt his nature much. Cleo. O, fear him not! You have been deceived. You know him not, my brother! O no. My Antony's made up of love and truth, Whatever woman's fondest wish would form him; Pleasant as summer, constant as the sun, And bounteous as the seasons.âHow now, Mardian, Saw you my lord? Mard. No, madam. But I met several of his officers laden with matters, caught up in a hurry, and bustling toward the bay. Cleo. How, Mardian, how!â Where tends their haste? Mard. That too I did enquire; but they turn'd upon me a look of contempt, and deign'd no further answer. Cleo. What may this mean? SCENE XII. Alexas enters. Alexas. Alas, my royal mistress! Some mischief is on foot.âI met the emperor, Striding, with furious pace, toward the port: His face was as the brow of angry heaven, When pests and blasting lightnings do impend, And mortals fly to cover. I shrunk from him: But, my ear caught the thunder of his voice, Which, with a ban, that shook the continent, Curs'd you, and us, and Egypt! Cleo. My heart misgives!âyet why I fear, I know not. SCENE XIII. Eros enters. [Cleo.] Eros!âO, welcome, Eros! Where goes thy lord? Eros. To Italy, my ladyâ Never again to set his foot in Egypt. Cleo. Alas! [Cleopatra faints. Eros. Haâso sudden! Breath and complexion gone!âNo feigning here! The swoon of death is on herâwhat need of steel? the very touch of grief hath cut her thread of life. âHe is abused. I swear it, by the gods, you have been abused, my master! Art. False, false Roman! Proud and insensibleâmy fears foretold it! Raise her up gentlyâShe revives. Cleo. Why have you brought me from the realms of silence, Into a world of woe?âCome hither, Eros! Now, as thou art a soldier, tell me truelyâ Has thy lord left us? Eros. Madam, he has. Cleo. Wherefore? Eros. He saw you in the arms of this Armenian, Caressing, and caress'd. Cleo. Say'st thou!âAy, there it isâO fatal error! He sawâbut knew not that he was my brother. Eros. Your brother, royal lady? Cleo. Ay, Eros, ay; even so, my long lost brother, The last of the imperial line of Lagos; All of my kindred that is left on earth, But newly found on this misdeeming day. Art. A woeful brother have I proved to thee, Thou brightness of thy race! What's to be done? Cleo. Good Eros, fly, pursue, o'ertake, arrest him! My lord, and thine!âreform this sad misprision. Turn back his truant stepsâfall at his feet; And kiss them, in the name of Cleopatra! From all my galleys, take the swiftest wing'd. Wait not for further orders, lest I hold thee From noon till night, with greetings to my Antony! A province waits on thy success!âAway, Away, kind Eros! Eros. Doubt not, I bring him on the speediest plumes Of love and fond impatience! [Exit Eros. Cleo. Alexas, fly thou afterâand thou, Mardian, After Alexas. Posts upon posts shall overtake my fugitive, Or I'll unpeople Egypt! Art. Sister, I take for ever from your sight, The source of this day's in-breach on your happiness. Where such a store of beauty is the tempter, Even brothers may give cause for jealous deemings. Cleo. I would not, yet, suspect my Antony, Of thoughts so devious. Art. I will reveal myself in person to him, And, by my absence, try to heal the wound My presence gave thy peace.âAnd O, 'tis time, 'Tis time I go.â The Ptolemies were wont to wed their sisters; And every hour I tarry, I shall think The union less unlawful. [Exit. Cleo. Charmian! Charm. My royal mistress. Cleo. These ills fall thickâHow lost is human nature, When left of all it loves!âPhotinus! Phot. Madam! Cleo. Stop your appointed revels through the realm; Triumphs and festivals are not for mourners! And, dost thou hear? Phot. Your pleasure. Cleo. Down with the towers, hang every house in black; And be no more the sound of music heard, Throughout the land of Egypt! [Exit Photinus. Charmian! Charm. Madam! Cleo. Prepare my couch, within the catacombs; Where I may lie, in this my death of comforts, With the remains of my great ancestors. See, that no voices of detested joy Disturb me in the silence of my sorrows; Nor any beam break in upon the gloom, Saving the lamp of midnight! [Exeunt. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Cleopatra, Charmian, and Iras. Cleo. O, These leaden-footed messengers! will they never arrive? Have earth and ocean conspired to shut us in from all tidings? I climb the pyramids, and look over the causeways leading to Pelusium; I ascend the Pharos, and strain my eyes to the verge of the world; I take the promontories for fleets, and the white vapours for sailsâbut no vessel comes! The land sends no post, the sea no pinnace, to tell where their lord and my lord is gone! Women enter with the Young Prince and Princess. Why have ye brought in these obtruders on me? 1st Wom. Madam, they leave their food, and pine in corners, and droop like over-charged flowers, but when you are present. Cleo. Alas, the dear ones!âwhat can I do for them? We but reflect discomforts on each other. They serve to shew, that I am unhusbanded; And I, that they are unfather'd! O, my twin-stars, must all our sports and pleasantries, Have ending thus!âWhere have ye been, my darlings? Y. Cleo. My brother and I, madam, have been hunting for our playfellow through all the chambers and galleries; and when we could not find him, we sat down and cried together. Cleo. Ay, there I should have been companion'd with ye. Tears, tears, my precious orphans, are an office, In which I would have born ye faithful fellowship. Alex. But, will our father never come back?â Shall we never have a father again, madam? Cleo. No, no. He thinks you homely and deform'd; And says you are misbegotten. Y. Cleo. Don't believe it, mother. He loves us better than if we were all made up of diamonds. Cleo. How should he chuse?âYes, you two are the links Of love and life, by which I yet depend To draw and bind him to me. Miriam, prepare the chariot for my princes; Give them a daily airing on the road By which their mighty father should return: The gods, by them, may send us happier issues. [Exeunt Children with their Attendants. Charm. You know not, my mistress, how much grief and sickness have changed you from yourself. Cleo. Will these messengers never come? Char. If you go on thus, you cannot live to enjoy the good tidings they shall bring you. Cleo. Come, thenâ We'll try, a little, to divert this heaviness. Give me mine angle, we'll along to the river; There, with enticing baits, I will betray The tawny fish: my bended hook shall pierce Their scarlet gills; and, as I draw them up, I'll think them every one an Antony, And cry, You are caught, you are caught! Charm. Do you remember, madam, how you shamed him, more than the loss of a battle; when he, exultingly, drew up a fire-dried mullet, which your diver had, secretly, fastened to his hook? Cleo. Yes, Charmian, yes. That timeâO times!â I banter'd him out of patience, and laugh'd him again into temper. I governed the man who governed the world, like a fish, with mine angle, and a singleâA messenger! [Horn sounds. Perhaps, from Italy!âCharmian, your arm. SCENE II. Messenger enters. [Cleo.] Saw'st thou Alexas, fellow?â Mess. No, madam. Cleo. Thy looks do speak dark tidingsâHe does come, As doth the raven to the sick man's window, To say his doom's at hand!âI would he'd speak, But cannot bid him. Mess. Madam! madam! Cleo. Dead? Mess. First, madamâHe is well. Cleo. Gold! give him gold!â But holdâit is a phrase of vulgar usage, To say the dead are wellâbring it to that, The gold I give thee will I melt, and pour Down thine ill uttering throat! Mess. I wait your patience. Cleo. Go to thenâI will hear theeâ But there's no goodness in thy face! Mess. He is well, madam. Cleo. Why, that's well said. Mess. And friends with CÃ¦sar. Cleo. Thou'rt an honest man! Mess. CÃ¦sar and he are greater friends than ever. Cleo. Make thee a fortune of me! Mess. But yetâ Cleo. I do not like, but yetâit does allay The good precedence.â Mess. He is married to Octavia. Cleo. The most infectious pestilence upon thee! Horrible villain!âhence! Mess. Gracious lady, I bring the news but made it not. Cleo. Slave, thou hast lived too long! [Exit Mess. Charm. Sweet mistress, keep yourself within yourself; The man is innocent. Cleo. Call him in againâ [Messenger returns. Though it be honest, it is never gracious To bring bad tidingsâ Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, henceforth Thou'lt look a gorgon to me.âIs he married? Mess. To CÃ¦sar's sister. Cleo. The gods confound thee!âdost thou hold there still? Mess. Should I lie, madam? Cleo. O, I would thou didst! So half my Egypt were submerged, and made A cistern for scaled snakes!â The merchandises thou hast brought from Italy, Are all too dear for meâGo, get thee hence!â Lie they upon thy hands, and be undone! [Exit Messenger. Charm. Good now, your highness, patience! Cleo. I will, and if I canâCall him again. [Exit Iras. Pray you, come hither, sir! [Enter Messenger. Mess. Good majesty! Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you, When you are in displeasure. Cleo. Nearer, come! Mess. Most gracious Queen! Cleo. Art thou assured he is married? Mess. Madam, I am. Cleo. Falsest, falsest Antony! O, murderous Roman, thou hast stabb'd my fame; And, on the fair fronts of thine own begotten, Branded the name of bastard!âTell me, fellow! Tell meâdidst see Octavia? Mess. I did, dread sovereign! I look'd her in the face, and saw her led Between her brother and Marc Antony. Cleo. SayâIs her stature tall? Mess. It is not, madam. Cleo. Didst hear her speak?âIs her voice silver-tuned? Mess. Madam, I heard her speakâshe is low-tongued. Cleo. And dwarfish?âSure, he cannot like her long! Char. Impossible. Iras. Impossible. Cleo. I think so, wenches.âTell me, gentle friend, What majesty is in her mien?âBethink theeâ Hast thou e'er look'd on majesty? Mess. Yes, lady!â The majesty of the world. Char. Isis forbid else!â The man is an Egyptian. Mess. She creeps, madam. Her motion and her person are as oneâ She shews a body, rather than a life; A statue, than a breather! Cleo. Is this certain? Mess. Or I have no observance. Char. Three in Egypt, Cannot make better note. Cleo. I do perceive it. He is very knowingâThere's nothing in her, yet. The fellow has good judgment. Iras. Excellent! Cleo. Guess at her years, I pray thee. Mess. Madam, she was a widow; and has children, Likely to make her grannam. Cleo. Hark! a widow, girls! Char. And grandmotherâO hideous! Iras. Ah, poor Antony! Cleo. Her hair, what colour? Mess. Black, madam; and her forehead As low as she could wish. Cleo. There is gold for theeâ Thou must not take my former sharpness ill. I will employ thee back again; I find thee Most fit for businessâGo, and make thee ready, We will prepare our letters. [Exit Messenger. Char. A proper man! Cleo. Indeed he is so.âI repent me much, That I so harried him.âWhy, as he reports, This creature is no such matter. Iras. Nothing. Cleo. The fellow has discernment, and should know. Char. Defend us else! the man has seen distinctions! Cleo. I have one thing, yet, to ask him, my good Charmian!â But, 'tis no matterâthou shalt bring him to me, Where I will writeâAll may be well enough. Char., Iras. We warrant you, madam. [Several horns sounds Cleo. From Italy, again!âperhaps. SCENE III. Alexas enters. Cleo. Alexas! Alexas. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!âHail Cleopatra! Shortly the mistress of the spacious East! Cleo. Alexas, thou art much unlike Marc Antony; Yet, coming from him, he doth gild thy favour. O, welcome! Where is our emperor? Alexas. On his way to Egypt. Cleo. Coming? Alexas. If that the heavy grief he took, to hear The tidings of your sickness, let him not, He holds me hard in chace. Cleo. And how, Alexas?âwellâand how?âthou hast put me Almost beside my sense! Alexas. Ere we could overtake, or learn his course, He reach'd Neapolis, where he met CÃ¦sar, Was reconciled, and wedded. Cleo. Lost again!â Perdition stands confirm'd. Alexas. Your patience, mistress! All's well as you could wish.âYour gallant brother First came, while Antony was at high feast, And sent a silver plate, thus mark'd in Syriac: âPtolemy Artuasdes, the last male offspring âof the line of Lagos, comes to resume the âshackles of the King of Armenia.â This sentence, like a Sybil's, ope'd, at once, His eye upon his error. Cleo. O, the gods, O the bless'd gods!âand is he then convinced? Alexas. He is, and tasks his fault with deep atonements. He rose, and down he came, and, to his breast, Clasp'd, and reclasp'd, the royal Artuasdes; Call'd him his brother, heap'd proud favours on him; And added Media to his wide dominions. Cleo. A trumpet!âwhence? [Trumpet. Alexas. By Isis and Osiris, yes, 'tis he. He comes!âthe emperor's trumpetâI do know it, By the pride of its tonance! Cleo. Nowâ The gods defend us from a sudden death, Although of transport! SCENE IV. Antony enters attended, &amp;c. Ant. O, thou day o'the world, Chain mine arm'd neck, leap thou, attire and all, Through proof of harness, to my heart! O Cleopatra! I should have flown, my love, and have prevented All tidings of my coming, though my messengers Had all been Mercuries, the sent of Jove, And wing'd at head and heel, But that the grief of your distemperature Did seize me at Brundusium, my mind's sickness Weighing my body downâtill, all impatient, I gave commandment to my sad attendants, To take me up, and cast me in the hold, And bear my bones, if nothing else, to Egypt! Not speak, my love? Why, Cleopatraâwhat?â All drown'd in tears?â Cleo. Let it be, sir.â'Tis nature's kind reliefâ Ant. A shower in Juneâ'tis full of sunshine, sweet!â Cleo. Will you not visit Octavia again suddenly? Ant. No more, no more of thatâthe fault of error! I pray thee, dearest, speak not, think not of her: For here I plight thee mine eternal faith, Never to part, till nature's frame shall sunder. Cleo. My Antony, my Antony, my Antony! [Embraces Ant. You're pale, my love; the morning of your cheek Lacks of its wonted rose; and that thief, sickness, Has robb'd me of a part of Cleopatra. Cleo. No matter, dear; you bring the sovereign balm, And now, all will be whole again. Ant. Butâ Mine eyes look round, in vain, for two acquaintance, Dear as the life that lights them. Where are my heirs of the world, my sun and moon? Where my young Cytherea of the isles, And Hero of the Grannic? Cleo. Gone on the way that points toward Pelusium; Their little hearts beating with expectation To meet their playfellow. Ant. Fly some, and give them note of our arrival.â How fare ye? How fare ye, my brave wenches? Charm. Thanks to your mightiness! Iras. We rejoice to see you! Ant. What, shall we to our sports?âI have been famish'd! All cramp'd and shackled with formalities; And, with a double and impetuous relish, I rush to my delightsâShall we have sport? I am all jovial, as the god of laughter; Frolic and wild, with boundless joy, as are The revellers of Bacchus! Cleo. Hye, Alexas! Proclaim a festival, a day of triumph, Through Alexandria! every door, fly open! And every house be made a theatre For freakful masque, and general exultation! Fill up the public cisterns, to the brim, With wines of th'ArchipelagoâHe, who shews A brow of sadness, on the day of Antony, We do attach him, as a public traitor To Egypt and our throne! SCENE V. Enobarbus enters. Ant. Domitius Enobarbus!âBy the Jove Of Horned Ammon, he!âHow's this, Domitius? Did I not leave thee in thy darling Italy, From whence thou didst refuse to move thy foot, Or share our further fortunes? Enob. Trueâit is all very true. Ant. And whence, and how, this most unlook'd for meeting? Enob. Because I am an assâis that any matter of news? Here I am come again to you, though the tide of discretion, and the wind of good fortune, were both full in my teeth. Ant. Why didst thou come, then? Enob. Why?âfor no why, that I know of.â Can any man give a reason for acting against reason? I'd have been damn'd, before I'd a come near you, if I could have found in my heart to have kept away.âIn my conscience, I think a lady, who shall be nameless, has given you a love-potion, and you have bequeathed the dregs to a certain foolish attendant of yours. Ant. Thank you, thank you, my honest soldierâ We will live to recompence this, and all former friendships. Cleo. Welcome to Egypt, my old monitor! Enob. No more of that, madam, no more of thatâthe last flaggon that I drank to your healths, has washed all kinds of catechism from memory; and I come to spend, what is lent me of life, in a laugh.âIs there no game on foot?âwhat jollity, what jubilee?âI will lead a dance to the maddest in Alexandria, Charm. You are welcome to Egypt! Iras. Welcome to Egypt, sir! Enob. Thanks, thanks, my sweet lasses!âbut, take care of your tyres, to nightâthere will be romps, I can tell ye! Ant. That's my brave Enobarbus! My Queen, my goddess! Yield him thy bluest veinsâa hand that kings Have lip'd, and trembled, kissing. [Enobarbus kisses her hand. Enob. By my troth, lovely lady, the world will never, again, give such another sweet apology, for a man's playing beside the purpose.â Cleo. Your true friend, ever. Messenger enters. Mess. My lord, a swift wing'd galley from Tarentum, Brings word that CÃ¦sar, with a mighty power, Sets out for Alexandria. Ant. 'Twere safer for him to have kept in port. What, does the young Diogenes come forth To bark at joy, and interrupt the pleasures His sourness cannot taste?âWe will chastize The boy for his presumption. Enob. My lord, I had forgot to tell you, that, before I left Italy, CÃ¦sar did publish a multitude of manifestos against you, appealing to the injury you had done his sister, and to the justice of his own quarrel, as he was pleased to stile it. Ant. No matter, no matter.âGuessing whereto I was bound, He sent me a saucy message to Brundusium; To which I return'd, That my weapon was desirous to give him personal answerâ Or, that I would meet him, host to host, on the plains Of that Pharsalia, where I did help his uncle, CÃ¦sar, to wrest the world from Pompey. Cleo. A woman to a boy, is equal controversy: I will, myself, go forth and chase him home! I have one hundred of the range of war, All in the bay, full mann'd, and 'quipt for service. Ant. That's my Penthesilea!âWe look out For our fleets, hourly;âhere they were appointed. We'll fight with him by sea! Enob. My dear master, Why would you do so?âYou have here, at hand, The force of nineteen legions, veterans all, The honourable remnant and approof Of courage, often tried, but never conquer'd. These were enough to win the world to Antony, Though all of it were CÃ¦sar's. Cleo. 'Tis against Cleopatra that Rome comes: The cause is Egypt's, Egypt's be the quarrel! Ant. The cause is your's, and your's be all the glory! Enob. You, therein, throw away The absolute soldiership you have by land; You do forego your own renowned knowledge, And cast assurance to the jaws of fortune. Cleo. Would you, then, let him land?âBy sea, my Antony! Ant. By sea, by sea, my mistress! Enob. O, noble emperor, do not fight by sea! Trust not to rotten planksâDo you misdoubt Our swords, and these our wounds?âLet the Egyptians And the PhÃ¦nicians go a duckingâWe Are used to conquer standing firm on earth, And fighting foot to foot. Ant. Well, wellâawayâ By sea, by land, by fire, or in the air, We would confront him!âCome, come on, my Thetis! [Exeunt. Enob. Well, Antony, wellâthe gods make me a false prophet!âbut we shall see, we shall see! [Exit. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Alexas, Charmian, Iras, and other Egyptians. Alexas. O, they went gallantly forth, gay as the May-bird! every vessel trimm'd, as to a bridal!âThere can be no doubt of their success. Charm. We may to play, then, Alexas. Where is this Soothsayer, thatâ Enobarbus enters. Enob. Away with your fooleries!âO, curse ye, curse ye all!âSink Egypt, ne'er to rise! Alexas. Why, what's the bustle? Enob. Mine eyes are blasted! From the Pharos, I saw it all.âYe gods and goddesses, even the whole synod of ye!â Alexas. How goes the fight? Enob. The fight?âNo fight!âNaught, naught, all naught. Scarce had the lines engaged, and, on my soul, With vantage for the dotard Antony, When the Antonias, your Egyptian admiral, With all her hundred, vilely turn'd the rudder. The hag of Egypt, Whom leprosy o'ertake! i' the midst of fight, Like to a cow in June, the breeze upon her, Hoists sail, and flies! Alexas. What, did all Egypt fly? Enob. All Egypt?âAy! Twelve plagues on Egypt!âThat is not the worst on't. But, soon as yourâwhat shall I call her?âturn'd her tail, The noble ruin of her magic, Antony, Claps on his sea-wing, like a doating mallard, Leaves the whole fight at height, the world for lost, And so flies afterâNever did I see An action of such shame! Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before Did violate so itself. Alexas. Here comes the emperor. Enob. O, look, look! How he is sunk with shame, a heavier weight Than that which presses Atlas!âKeep, keep from him! Go!â [Exit, driving the others out. SCENE II. Antony enters, followed at a distance by some friends and soldiers. Ant. Harkâthe land bids me tread no more upon itâ It is ashamed to bear me!âO, mine eye Will never look up to a human face, With firmness any more.âCome hither, fellows!â I am so lated in the world, that I Have lost my way for everâI have a ship Laden with gold; take that, divide itâFlyâ And make your peace with CÃ¦sar! Friends. Fly, my lord? Not we. Ant. I fled myself; and have instructed cowards To turn, and shew their shouldersâLeave me, friends! Leave meâpray go!âfor, indeed, I have lost commandâ Therefore, I pray you!â [They go out. O, Cleopatra, thou hast cut me off From fellowship, for ever!â My very hairs do mutiny; for the white Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them For cowardice and dotage.âO, alone! As haunts the wild Behemoth in the forest, Secrete from every eye!â Down, down, unpillar'd Antony! Down with thy star-topt greatness! [Falls. SCENE III. Eros enters first, and speaks to Cleopatra, who is without. Then enter Cleopatra supported by Charmian and Iras. Eros. Madam, he is hereâ You may enterâpray you now, look! Cleo. Stay, stay a little! [Stops short at entrance. Ant. Retrieve it?â O noâit is impossible! Eros. See you here, sir! Ant. Downright shamefulâ O fye, fye, fye! Eros. Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him. Cleo. Let me stop shortâO Juno!â Ant. Yesâat Philippiâhe did keep his sword, Like a far-fencer, whilst I struck, at hand, The lean, but sinewed CassiusâAnd 'twas I Gave ending to the Brutus!âThis raw youngster Dealt on lieutenancy, and no practice had In the deep squares of warâbut nowâNo matter! Cleo. Ah, stand by! Eros. Most noble sir, regardâthe Queen approaches! Ant. I have offended reputation, past Recovery to the end. Eros. The Queen, the Queen, sir! Ant. The Queen?â O!âwhither hast thou led me, Egypt?âSee, How I convey my shame out of mine eyes, While I look back on what I left behind, Now gulph'd in vile dishonour! [Rises. Cleo. O, my lord! Forgive my fearful sails.âI little thought That any would have followed. Ant. Thou knowest, thou knowest!â Cleo. I did not know myselfâI dreamt I had courage. But, when the battle join'd its terrible rangesâ When shouting hosts rent the wild airâthen, then! Ant. I thought thee slain, or wounded; and, in thee, The world already lost.âO, thou didst know My heart was to thy rudder tied by the string, And thou shouldst tow me after!âO'er my spirit, Thy full supremacy thou knew'stâand that Thy beck might, from the bidding of the gods, Command me! Cleo. Oâmy pardon! Ant. Now I must, Or die, or dodge and palter poorlyâI Who, with the bulk of half the world, play'd wide, Making and marring fortunes!âCleopatra, The world is CÃ¦sar's nowâthou hast given it to him! Cleo. O, pardon, pardon, pardon! Ant. Nay, now, nayâ Fall not a tear! I want not those to sink me. Love, I am full of leadâSome wine, I pray you; Wine and our viands!âWe'll yet strive, my wench, To lift our load aloft!âFortune doth know, When she bears hard, she finds us at the strongestâ I'll wait you by-and-by. Cleo. I will not leave you. Ant. Nay, now!â Cleo. Well, well; indeed, I have no right; Your's ought to be the rule. [Exeunt Cleopatra and Attendants. SCENE III. Enter Enobarbus, who stands distant. Ant. Ay, who knows?â That's somewhat, yetâAll is not lost by land. There's firm Canidius, and our legions.â O Enobarbus! Had I ta'en thy counsel, CÃ¦sar had been the mourner.âWhere's Canidius? Enob. No matterâask not for him. Ant. Ask not for him? Enob. My dear, dear master, rear your soul aloft! Be all yourself, all hero, as you are wont, When mightiest pressures comeâfor they do fall Heavy and thick upon you! Ant. I say, where is Canidius? Enob. Gone out of callâ At least, the call of Antonyâ To CÃ¦sar gone;âhe, and your nineteen legions. Ant. Spirit of truth!âCanidius?âmy friend? The man these hands have moulded into greatness? Ohâ Who leave themselves, ought to be left of others. My conduct has corrupted honest menâ My nineteen veteran legions too? Enob. Your nineteen legions. Ant. There's the main limb lopt off! Enob. I have a pinnace, ready mann'd and moor'd Beneath the sea-worn beachâEscape and join Your conquering troops in Parthia! Ant. Escape, escape!âshall Antony escape? Enob. Not from the arms of Rome, my emperor! But from the gulph of EgyptâO, escape, Escape, in haste! Ant. Although she hath undone us, it were base, 'Twere base to leave her to the vengeful fangs Of CÃ¦sar and Octavia. Enob. O, my master, It is not Cleopatra that's in dangerâ Beware your proper safety! Ant. What dost mean? Enob. Think of the terms she may obtain from CÃ¦sar, Even at a price, no other than the head Of him, whose world she lost. Ant. O, fie, fie!âthink not of it. Enob. Have you seen the ambassador? Ant. Ambassador? Enob. Ay. Ant. Whose ambassador? Enob. CÃ¦sar's. Ant. Noâwhen? Enob. Now, nowâNay, wonder not; 'Twas not to Antony that CÃ¦sar sent him. I mark'd him, in his way to the Queenâa smooth And subtle politician, one ThyrÃ¦us.â I watch'd, and heard him crave a secret audience From Cleopatra. Ant. Ha!â Enob. This intimation, as a further proof Of dangerous, tho' dark intent, was sent me From CÃ¦sar's camp. [Gives a paper. Ant. There is a colour in it. If that she does but veer A second from the point! Enob. Poor woman!âcan you blame her?âShe has now, No other sail to shift. Ant. No other?â Enob. No.âShe cannot chuse. Ant. She shall be tested!âCome! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Cleopatra and ThyrÃ¦us enter, attended by Alexas, Charmian, Iras, &amp;c. Cleo. Who are you, sir? Thyr. ThyrÃ¦us, lady, a chief counsellor And confident of CÃ¦sar'sâCÃ¦sar prays you To take no wakeful thought for what may fall, In such conflictions. He himself hath taken To his own breast the care of Cleopatra. Cleo. A courtesy unlook'd for! Thyr. For your high person, crown, and dignity, He holds them as things holy, as a property Pertaining to the gods. Cleo. Unwonted bounty! Thyr. To Egypt, and to all you have, elsewhere, Of royal tenantry, 'tis CÃ¦sar's will To pile, and not to lessen by the gripe Of mean deduction. Cleo. He speaks, and grants, like one, who is to be The universal landlord.âSay to CÃ¦sar, That, in return for this rich world, which I Took from my Antony and gave to him, My sole petition is, that he inflict not The heavy penance of his pique to me, Upon my innocent people! Thyr. So please your highness, Order for this already is announced Throughout our hostsâPermit me the fair grace, To seal the honours of my deputation Upon this peerless wax!â Cleo. Sirâyou mistakeâthis is your CÃ¦sar's hand; It turn'd the rudder for him! [Kisses her right hand while Antony enters. Ant. Favours!âby Jove, that thunders!â Who art thou fellow? Thyr. One, who does perform The biddings of the fullest man on earth. Ant. Approach there!â [To Servants without. Ah, you kite!âNow, gods and dÃ¦mons! Authority melts from me of lateâWhen I cried, hoa! Like racers to the goal, kings would start forth And cry, your will?âHave ye no ears?â I am Antony yet.âTake hence this jack, and whip him! [Servants enter. Thyr. Whip me, my lord? Ant. Moon and stars!âwhip him. Were it twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge CÃ¦sar, should I find them So saucy with the hand ofâshe there!âwhat's her name, Since she was Cleopatra?âWhip him, fellows! Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face, And whine for mercyâTake him hence! Thyr. Sir, sir, you play with stingsâI am patrician; And, in my deputation, bear the person And weight of CÃ¦sar. Ant. Give the gods a sacrifice! Whip the boy CÃ¦sar in him!âbeing whipt, Bring him againâThis jack of CÃ¦sar's shall Bear us an errand to him.âDrag him away!â [Exeunt Servants with ThyrÃ¦us. Cleo. Nowâwhat's the matter?â A spice of the old humour?â Ant. Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Italy? Forborn the getting of a Roman issue, And by a gem of women; to be abused By one, who looks on feeders? Cleo. O!âis it come to this? Ant. To let a fellow, that will take rewards, And cry heaven quit you, be familiar with My playfellow, your hand!âO, that I were Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar The horned herdâfor I have savage cause! Servant enters with ThyrÃ¦us. What, is he whipt? Serv. Soundly, my lord. Ant. Cried he, and begg'd a pardon? Serv. He did ask favour. Ant. Henceforth, fellow, The white hand of a lady fever thee! Shake to look on it!â Hence with thy shameâBegone!â [Exit ThyrÃ¦us. Cleo. Have you done yet? Ant. To flatter CÃ¦sar, would you mingle eyes, With one who doffs his sandals? Cleo. Not know me, yet? Ant. Cold-hearted tow'rd me! Cleo. Ah, dear, if I be so, Turn, ye stern ministers, my blood to hail, And strike my heart with death!âThis, this vile hand Was that I gave him, as a thing unvalued, For having turn'd the rudder from my Antony. Alexas. She told him so. Ant. No more than so?âI know not why, of late, This yestiness of temper comes upon me,â I have wrong'd you, love!âI shame to look upon you! Withdraw a whileâleave meâI pray you leave me, Until I have admonish'd my wrought spirit, To more of constancy! [Exit Cleopatra, &amp;c. SCENE V. To Antony Demetrius enters. Ant. O fie, O fieâ To such a woman tooâthe moon o'the world!â Demetrius? Dem. Hye you from Egypt, sirâ You stand in peril! Ant. Yet, I stand! Dem. O sir!â I come from CÃ¦sarâ Ant. Well. Dem. To Cleopatra. Ant. Again, to Cleopatra? Dem. Here, he offers To piece Arabia, Syria, Palestine, To Egypt's throne,âso she will send your head! Ant. He holds us, still, of priceâWe thank him for it. Dem. I would not have you fall so poorly, Antony! Ant. You are CÃ¦sar's servant. Dem. One of a number, who, in CÃ¦sar's camp, Wish, from their souls, that Antony were lord Of his own spirit! Ant. Wouldst thou do a kindness? Dem. Most willingly. Ant. To Cleopatra, go; And bring me here her answerâ Thou saw'st me notâtake note. [Exit Demetrius. SCENE VI. To Antony, Eros. Eros. News, my most noble master! Your scatter'd navy, From several points, and pieced once more together, Now anchors in the bay; and, join'd by Egypt, May mate, once more, with CÃ¦sar. Ant. There is life in't. Eros. Your valiant fellows, too, whom false Canidius Gave up to CÃ¦sar, now return apace, And croud the market-place. Ant. We'll feast them there!â Give order for itâWe will forth ourself, And chear their honest hearts! [Exit Eros. SCENE VII. To Antony, Demetrius. Ant. Return'd so soon?âYou had scant audience, sir. Dem. Short as her answer.âHaving heard, and smiled A scorn at my proposalâ âThe head of Antony?â quoth sheââTell your master, âThat when he shall have got two worlds to truckââ Ant. Two worlds!âten worlds are in that answerâSir, We thank your pains! Dem. She is the Cleopatra of the earth! Farewell, most noble Antony,âthe great gods Have you in keeping! [Exit Demetrius. SCENE VIII. To Antony, Enobarbus. Enob. To the east, to the east, my emperor! Octavia comes, with fifty sail o'the line, To snatch you from her brotherâShe, herself, Will company your escape. Ant. I will not go. Enob. Not go? Now, my most precious master, I do pray you, Leave this bad woman! Ant. Bad woman?âSlave and lyar! Enob. Ha!â Slave, Antony, slave?âwe chafe, and grow forgetful. Ant. Didst thou not swear, even now, that she was false? O, more than heavenly truth!âthan tortured gold, Come forth with all its weight!â Goâthou malicious!âthou hast ever been A boom athwart my currentâThou dost cry, Escape, escape!âand would'st make me the vile Associate of thy fearsâHenceâfly, brave captain! Shelter thyself with CÃ¦sarâhence, I say!â Enob. I had but two small reasons for my stayingâ The one was, that which made all others leave you, Your misfortunes, Antony.âThe secondâ No matter for the second reason, Antony!â You merit not to have itâFare you well! [Exit. Antony walks about discomposed. Ant. âBad woman?â O, the lyar!â When will these passions leave me?â âFool that he was! he parted me, When I had destined him, at least, a kingdom, In quittance of his servicesâ I am sorry!âScarus!â Scarus enters. Scarus. My lord! Ant. Is Enobarbus gone? Scarus. He is, sir. Ant. Follow and call him backâStay yet, a littleâ Ar't certain he is gone? Scarus. I am, sir. I met, and ask'd him whither he was bound?â He put a sudden kerchief to his face, And sobb'd aloudâto CÃ¦sar! Ant. O, I am grown the very strangler Of those who help'd my breathingâWho went with him? Scarus. He went alone, my lord. Ant. His treasures, manâ Those he took, certain! Scarus. Not any thing, my good lord. Ant. Haste, Scarusâtake them after.â Do itâdetain no jotâload me ten camels.â Treble his store!âbear thanks and greetings to him! My best adieus and prayers, that he may find A master less ungrateful! [Exit Scarus. Ant. Thy fellow, thy fellow, Enobarbus!â I must live long for that! To Antony, Eros. Eros. The Queen, my lord, Does feast your soldiers in the market-place. They are brave fellows, and become their seams. They shout it rarely, and do call aloud, For Antony! Ant. There's hope in't yetâ We'll have one other blazing night, my Eros, Before we die.âCall to me my sad captains. Set on the banquetâfill our bowlsâonce more, Let's mock the midnight bell! Eros. That's my brave master! Ant. I will be treble sinew'd, hearted, breathed, And fight maliciously!âI'll set my teeth, And send to darkness all that stop me! Come on, my soldierâthe next time I fight, I'll make death envious; for I will contend, Even with his pestilent scythe! [Exeunt. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. CÃ¦sar's Camp near Alexandria. Enobarbus walking in great emotion before it. Soldier enters. Enob. So, brother soldier, didst thou tell Agrippa? Sold. I did, my lord; he'll wait you by-and-by. Enob. Well, well;âI am not custom'd to attend The leisure of the great. [Exit Soldier. Why did I come?â'twas but a gustful word Torn from him, and cast forth by sudden passion.â Were Antony as he was, I had done nobly; Now, it was baseâMisfortune has its privilege, And should not be forsaken!â Fie, fie, Domitius!â Scarus enters. Scarus. My lord Enobarbus, my master Antony grieves for some offences he has done you. Enob. Offences?âAy, Scarus; great offences! Scarus. He sends you many greetings, and kind adieus; and wishes you may find a more grateful master. Enob. Oâ There's no doubt, there's no doubt, Scarus; CÃ¦sar's worth twenty of him! Scarus. He sends you, moreover, all that is precious of your moveables, and trebles your store from his own treasury. Enob. Tell him I am rich enough in the graces of Octavius. Take back your trumpery! Scarus. Here are ten camels laden, each of them richer than a PhÃ¦nician hulk. Enob. Cast your treasures into the Nileâ They'll make sport for the divers.âHence!âor I call the guard! Scarus. How this will vex my noble master, Antony!âFarewell, Enobarbusâby the gods, I always thought you of a kindlier disposition. [Exit Scarus. Enob. He is gone in timeâI could hold it no longerâI am the veriest varlet of the earth!âO Antony, Antony! thou mine of bounty, thou spirit of fellowship, and heart of friendship!â Were the gods of my counsel, this world were a petty earnest of thy boundless domain.âHow I do shrink, and vanish into nothing, within my own contempts!âNight, thou true mistress of dun melancholy, discharge thy poisons on me!âHeart, that left him, dash on the flint and hardness of thy fault, till thou art powder!â Alarm sounded. Soldiers cross the Stage in a hurry. 1st Sold. To arms, to arms! Antony is already in the field, And drives the advanced squadrons of our army, Like dust before the hurricane! [Exeunt Soldiers. Enob. Now, now, [Alarm continues. Without his knowledge could I but cast My blood and life into his cause, I then Should die, in part reveng'd upon his graciousness! [Exit. SCENE II. Changes to Alexandria. Cleopatra enters attended. Cleo. Most gallantly did he go forthâO, that he and CÃ¦sar might end it hand to hand.âThen, Antony, ay, then!âbut nowâWell, girls,â no worser than the worst, can comeâand there's the end of allâand all, in time, will have an ending! Alexas enters. Alexas. News, madam, news!âour glorious master, Antony, has beat them to their trenches! Cleo. O, the gods!â Is't possible?âNow is our fatal hour!â Now is our infinite at stakeâthe world, Or nothing!âOur good stars, that empty left Their former spheres, must now shine forth again, Or else be dark for ever! Mardian enters. Mard. News, news, my royal mistress! From Alexandria, to the camp of CÃ¦sar, Our fields wax fat with hostile carcasses; And Antony, now captain of the world, Returns triumphant! Cleo. Great is thy godhead, Isis! Iras! quick, quick, my tires!â Haste, give the word throughout! prepare the banquet! Call up the music!âWe will forth to meet him. SCENE III. While Cleopatra prepares to go out, Trumpets sound. Antony enters in Triumph. Cleo. Lord of heroes! O, first of valours! Com'st thou smiling from The whole world's toil, uncaught? [Embraces. Ant. My nightingale! We have beat them to their beds.âGive me thy hand! Through Alexandria make a jolly march, Bear our hack'd harness, like the men that own them! I thank you all, for doughty-handed are ye. Enter the cityâclip your wives, your friends; Tell them your feats, while they, with joyful tears, Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss The honour'd gashes whole! [Exeunt Soldiers. Cleo. Soldier of glory!âAntony of Romans! What has thine arm atchiev'd! Ant. O Queen of all contentsâSpirit of love! But for a single loss, this glorious day, Of all the days of my triumphant life, Had born away the palm! Cleo. What loss, my hero?â Amid the acquisition of a world, What loss can come? Ant. More worth than all that world, The loss of such a friend!âWhere the fight burn'd, And where, from every quarter, death assail'd me; He rush'd between, and cast his faithful breast, Upon the spears that levell'd at our corselet: With blood, and sweat, and dust, his face was covered. But, when the tide of battle bore him from me, I sent to seek him thro' the thickest fight, By the white foam of his exalted plume, That floated o'er the field!â Cleo. A province to the man who finds him for us, That we may set him, as our chiefest gem, In the world's crownet. Ant. 'Tis the proper sphere, For such a virtue!âGo, my Queen of kingdoms! A soldier's occupation asks refreshment. Order our banquet! [Exeunt Cleopatra and Attendants. Sold. We have brought him, my lord, [Soldiers speak without. We have brought him! Ant. O, the brave fellow!âGive him to my arms! Had he escaped the value of his deeds, I had died worthless! Enobarbus brought in. Ant. Strike me, Jove's bolt!âDomitius Enobarbus!â O, thou hast cut me to the heart, Domitius! Thou hast ta'en the surest, sharpest way, for vengeance; And set the faults of Antony before him, Keener than all the arms that range with CÃ¦sar! Enob. Pardon, pardon! [Bends on one knee. Ant. Is it thou that asks it?âO the wealth of souls! Heart to my heartâ [Raises and embraces him. Never be more distinction, 'twixt thy Antony And EnobarbusâGods!âthe world is theirs, And his the worthier half! Enob. I would I had rather died for you in the battle! For you are purposed to slay me, my masterâ To kill me, with your goodness! Eros enters. Eros. My lord, my lord, CÃ¦sar's whole fleet comes bellying on amain, And means, no doubt, to charge us in the bay. Ant. They shall be welcome, Eros. We will, ourself, aboard, and gage this time, No coward hand shall turn a prow to Egypt. Scarus enters. Scarus. My lord, I bring you unexpected tidings. The beaten CÃ¦sar hath ta'en heart anew, Hath cast his circling fosses to the earth, And, with fresh powers, unnumber'd as the sands, Comes down upon the city. Ant. Divide me, gods!âthat he may have an Antony, By sea and land, to cope with!â What, has the boy such mettle?âWe, once more, Will shew him to his tent!â Domitius Enobarbus! Enob. Sir! Ant. Muster our brave companions, good Domitius. Tell themâ 'Tis but returning to a half-eat banquet; We have stomach for it yet! Enob. I will, my heart o'the world! [Exit Enobarbus. Soothsayer crossing the Stage. Ant. Soothsayer! Sooth. My lord. Ant. Well, Soothsayer, thou dost see that we can conquer, In spite of Augury. Sooth. 'Tis true, great emperor! O, such another day, the world, to nothing, Again were Antony'sâBut, noblest master, Make you quick profit of your present vantage. Swallows have built in Cleopatra's sails: The moody Augurs shake the downward brow, But dare not speak their forethought. Ant. O, we ask not Augury, But courage for our counsel!âHark apartâ If that thou canst unfold the growth of time, That now lies in the seed, inform, I pray thee, What lot do we draw hereafter? Sooth. Thou shalt imitate The act of that same enemy, on whose corse Thy kindly tears did fall. Ant. Whom? Sooth. Brutus. Ant. What, stab CÃ¦sar? Sooth. I cannot sayâthe dÃ¦mon comes upon me, Like lightning in the nightâa sudden flashâ And all again is darkness! SCENE IV. To Antony, Enobarbus, and Soldiers. Enob. My passion's breathless! Ant. The matter? Enob. All's lostâthe Cleopatra has betray'd us! Her fleets have yielded to the foe, and yonder Cast up their caps, and shout aloud for CÃ¦sar! Ant. Triple turn'd harlot!âShe hath sold me, sold me!â Fly, my brave fellows, fly!âthere's loss enough! For when I am reveng'd upon my spell, I have done all! Go, Enobarbusâbid them all flyâbegone! [Exeunt all but Antony. Ant. O sun, thine uprise shall I see no more!â Fortune and Antony part here!â All come to this?âThe pine, the pine is bark'd, That overtopt them all!â O, this false soul of Egypt! She hath beguiled me, to the very heart Of loss and defamation!â Ah, thou witchâavaunt! Cleopatra enters. Cleo. Why is my lord in wrath? Ant. Vanish! or I shall spoil thy CÃ¦sar's triumph!â Stay!ârather let him take theeâhoist thee up, To the mechanic rabble of lewd Rome! The shrillness of their shouts shall tear thine organs, And the close rankness of their gathering breaths Cloud thee to suffocation!â Letâlet Octavia, with prepared nails, Plough up thy visage!â Letâ'Tis well thou'rt gone! [Exit Cleopatra. Ho, Eros, ho!â The Shirt of Nessus is upon meâHercules! Teach me, mine ancestor, thy rage! Let me lodge Lychas on the horn o'th'moon! And, with a club, above the lift of CÃ¦sar, Subdue my worthier self!âThe witch shall die!â She hath sold me, and she dies for'tâEros, ho!â [Exit. SCENE V. Cleopatra re-enters, with Alexas, Mardian, Charmian, Iras. Cleo. Defend us, wenches!âO, he is more mad Than Telamon for his shieldâthe boar of Thessaly Was never so emboss'd! Alexas. The soul and body rive not more in parting, Than greatness going off.âTo your monument, madamâthere keep at bay! Cleo. O me!âI know not whither!â Away, then, friendsâto the monument! [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Antony and Eros. Ant. She flies our vengeanceâNo matterâlet her live To infamy, for ages!â O, Eros, Eros, the long day is done, And we must sleep.â Rather than stoop to such a thing as CÃ¦sar, Come, Egypt, pile thy pyramids upon me, Till they do scale the bluest vault of heaven, And heave against the stars! Eros. If that my noblest master be so minded, Why, there's an end thenâ When the light's out, 'tis only to lie down, And stray no further. SCENE VII. The Children enter, and run to Antony. Cleo. O, save us, father, save us! they are just at our heels! Alex. Give me a sword, sir! our guards are run away. All we meet are gone mad, and look as if they would kill us. Ant. O, this last agony was kept in store, For those who smile in death, and laugh at torture! Cleo. Indeed they'll kill usâsave us, father, save us! Ant. O, I would save ye, wrap ye with my vitals, Fold my fond heart and yearning soul about ye! Alex. Don't fear now, sister! He will let no one near us. Ant. Alas, my sweet companions, my dear infants, The quick and feeling part of my existence, Our plays are doneâour plays are done, my children! Rent is the rock, where rose your tower of strength; And, on your precious headsâay, there's the ruinâ My ruin tumbles! Cleo. What is the matter, sir, pray what's the matter? Alex. Why do you look so sad, and fearful on us? Ant. Hell, darkness, demons! Did ye foresee it, godsâyet suffer this to be? It is not to be bornâhere, Eros, take them! Bear off my little onesârend, wrench them from me! Cleo. We will not leave you, sir! Alex. We will not leave you!âWhere should we go to, father? Ant. Well thought, well thought!âAh, where, indeed, my children? Your world is seiz'd into the hands of strangers; And not a nook is left upon the earth, To rest your little heads! O, you companions of my blissful hours! Will your stern masters see your bonds be soft, Lest they should gall these delicate limbs? Or will some envious stepdame, from a brow Of clouds, shed comforts on you?âNo, no, no! Alex. Where you go, sir, we'll go. Cleo. Don't part us, father! Ant. 'Tis well advisedâ The insulting foe shall have no part of Antony, To vaunt his triumph on! Eros. What mean you, sir? Ant. Eros, hold off! I am not myselfâmy thoughts are full of fellness! [Draws a dagger. Alex. Ah, father, you won't kill us? Ant. Kill ye?âO, noâI had rather pierce my heart, Than prick your smallest finger! Cleo. Save us!â O, save us, father, from that ugly dagger! Ant. So quick, it shall not hurt yeâ Eros,âkeep off!â Eros. Noâstrike them through me!â [Interposes. What, would you black the whiteness of your name To infinite ages? Ant. Ha!âThat might be worth a thought! Hasteâbear them henceâand charge the eunuchs with 'em. Away, lest sudden frenzy should returnâ And you, and I, and they, all plunge together! [Exit Eros with Children. SCENE VIII. To Antony Enobarbus. Enob. Pardon, my lord, I have greatly wrong'd your Queenâ Yes, greatly wrong'd her!âOn my soul, she has been Loyal and loving, everâCurs'd Photinus, That recreant slave, Photinus, has betray'd Her, you, and us, and all our world, to CÃ¦sar. But, more of that, when time may serveâ Haste, haste, my master, while there yet remains A hold to hang a hope on! Ant. What hold, what hope? I have lifted CÃ¦sar to his heav'n of empire; And now, the scaffolding, by which he rose, Is cast to ruin! Enob. Near the western gate, I have a band of trusty resolutes. Ant. Ha, say'st thou? Enob. For a sally! Ant. One bold push! Enob. One gallant chance! Ant. To perish warm! Enob. Or force our passage! Ant. To Parthia,ânoble!âto retrieve a world, Or in a blaze expireâCome on, my soldier! [Exeunt. SCENE IX. Changes to the Monument. Cleopatra, Iras. Cleo. No, Iras, death is what I wish forâeither To fall into the nothing whence I rose, Or take my future lot among immortals.â Dyingâ'tis that I dread!â I stand, I tremble, as upon the brink Of some unfathom'd flood, and wish to plunge, But dare not!â Iras. Yet, take comfort, sweetest mistress! Cleo. No, Iras, noâall comforts we detest; Our size of grief is infinite as our loss, Stretching the sides of thought! Now, Mardian, saw you my lord? [Mardian enters. Is he yet informed of my innocence? Mard. Madam, he is; and if he thrives, you shall hear from him. I met him at the head of a small band of daring Followers, bent to win his way by the western portalâ That is not the worst tidings. Cleo. Ha!âsayst thou?âwhat?âperhaps my childrenâdead? Are they murder'd? Mard. The traitor, Alexas, madam, forced them from the eunuchs, and has carried them to the camp, to make his peace with CÃ¦sar. Cleo. O, they have made a wreck of me already; And, ere I sink unto the peaceful bottom, They do dismember me.âO, my sweet lambs, My babes of gentleness and beauty!âhow, How will ye bear with the unkindly frost Of strange and hostile brows?âWho, now, will lay Your nightly pillow soft; or, in the day, Delight to see and share your playfulness? O, ye will miss a mother's tenderness; Your hearts will think upon your native Egypt, And break with the remembrance! Mard. Fear not, madam, The very aspect of the royal little ones Shall smooth the rugged face of war, and tygers Shall caress them. Cleo. Go, Mardian, hasteâbear this to CÃ¦sar's sisterâ [Gives a casket. It holds the purchase of five provinces. Tell her it is my dying legacy, And let it mediate for the little innocents, Who know of no offences. Mard. I will, madam. [Exit. SCENE X. Charmian enters, Char. O false, false Egyptâ He's dying, mistress, dying! Clo. Dost thou mean Antony? Charm. When, as he would have pass'd the western gate, Your faithless Alexandrians set themselves Against his purpose.âBeing thus begirt, Within, without, by foes, and no way left, He, Eros, and his faithful Enobarbus, All turn'd their mighty swords upon themselves, And fell together. Cleo. What, my own Egyptians? Dogs, dogs, and harpies, monsters of the Nile! False, recreant Egypt!âNever more arise A prince, of thine own race, to honour thee! But foreign vultures, with fell beaks and talons, Seize on thy state, and prey upon thy vitals, Even to the end, the end of time! Iras, O, madam, Lo, where the emperor comes! Char. Bloody and wanâhis failing steps supported By his sad captains! Cleo. OhâI seeâ'tis doneâ'tis overâallâ Ye godsâyou can no more! O wreck of heaven and earth!âO Antony, Antony! SCENE XI. Antony enters, supported by Officers. Ant. Gently, my friends, or I am gone! Oâthere! [They let him down. Adieuâtake with you my eternal thanks For this, your latest serviceâsoâfriendsâleave me! Would I had another world to part among you, Better than that we have lost! [Exeunt Officers. Cleo. Woe, woeâalas!âthe soldier's pole is fallen! Oâwither'd is the garland of the war! And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon! Ant. True, thou sweet bird, whose song made all my summer!â The long, long winter's come; and we must moult, Never to plume again!âO, pardon, love!â Have I your pardon for my rash suspicions? I weep for it in blood! Cleo. I'll not survive you, If swords, or knives, or drugs, or serpents, have Edge, sting, or operation. Ant. Loveliest, dearest, Live, live, I charge youâthink on our poor infants! I am dying, Egypt, dying!âTell me; Wilt thou remember, Antony?âthat hope Is my last cheerâa light for steps that enter On the dark journey! Cleo. Oâhe is goingâgoing! Ant. I would fain stay longer with theeâ A little longer!âbutâit will not be. Shall we not meetâshall we not meet again?â Perhapsâin happier climes!â Nowânow I feel what's deathâ'tis nature's wreckâ Torn from herself!â It isâit is to part from Cleopatraâ Never to join again!â Thine image, now, is all that's left meâOâ O, Cleopatra!â [Dies. Cleo. Gone!â Is it possibleâor did we only dream? Charm. Dream, madam? Cleo. Yes.â I dream'd there was an emperor Antonyâ O, such another sleep!â His face was as the heavens, and therein shone A sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted This little of the earth! Charm. Most sovereign lady, The gods preserve you firm! Cleo. His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm Crested the earth; his voice was propertied As all the tuned spheres! But, when he meant to quail, and shake the globe, He was as rolling thunder!âFor his bounty It knew no winter, girls; it was an autumn, That grew the more by plucking.âIn his livery Walk'd crowns and coronetsâRealms and islands were As plates dropt from his pocket! Charm., Iras. Madamâdear madam! Cleo. Knew ye not such an Antony? Both. We did, we did.âButâ Cleo. But there he lies, scarce better now to look on, Than the world's CÃ¦sar!âGirls, O girlsâsee there! Our day is doneâour latest lamp is spent, And we are for the dark! [Trumpets and shouts. Iras. Madam, they comeâlook, look! Cleo. Give me the aspicksâquick! Charm. O mistress! Cleo. What!â Not such another wordâWhy, how now Charmian? Good cheer! we'll yet be happy, girls!âQuick, quick! I am fire and airâmy other elements I give to baser life! [Applies the Aspicks. Charm. O eastern star!âwe could not, if we would, Survive when thou art quench'd. Cleo. Peace, peace!â Do ye not see my baby at my breast, That sucks the nurse asleep?â If death's no more than this, life is not worth Leave-takingâCharmian, I am going, Charmian! Now, Antony, Antony!âI come, I come! [Dies. Char. Close, downy windows, close! And golden PhÅbus never be beheld Of eyes, again, so royal! [Noise at the gate. Now Iras! [They apply the aspicks. Guard. Make way, make way! [Gate broke open. Agrippa enters with Roman chiefs. Agrip. How, how!â Was this well done? Iras. Yesâ Charm. Rarely, rarely, Roman! [They both fall. Agrip. Rarely indeed, for faithfully!âCome, friends, Let us behold this wonderâShe does look Like sleep, as she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of Grace.âLay them together. Never was yet the boastful monument Could compass such a pairâHere conquest ought To weep, and wash with tears the end it sought.</field>
