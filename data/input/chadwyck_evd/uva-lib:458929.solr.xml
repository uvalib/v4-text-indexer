      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima Enter 2. Ushers, and Groomes with perfumes. 1. Usher. Round, round, perfume it round, quick, loook ye Diligently the state be right, are these the richest Cushions? Fie, fie, who waits i'th' wardrobe? 2 Ush. But pray tell me, do you thinke for certaine These Ambassadours shall have this morning audience? 1. Ush. They shall have it: Lord that you live at Court And understand not? I tell you they must have it. 2 Ush. Upon what necessity? 1 Ush. Still you are of the tricke of Court, sell your place Enter Ladies and Gentlemen. And sow your grounds, you are not for this tillage. Madams, the best way is the upper lodgings, There you may see at ease. Ladies. We thanke you sir. Ex. Ladies, Gent. 1 Ush. Would you have al these slighted? who should report then The Embassadors were hansome men? his beard A neat one? the fire of his eyes quicker then lightning, And when it breaks, as blasting? his legs, though litle ones, Yet movers of a masse of understanding? Who shall commend their cloaths: who shall take notice Of the most wise behaviour of their feathers? Ye live a raw man here. 2 Ush. I thinke I doe so. Enter 2. Citizens, and Wives. 1 Ush. Why, whether would you all presse? 1 Cit. Good Master Usher. 2 Cit. My wife, and some few of my honest neighbours, here. 1 Ush. Prethee begon thou and thy honest neighbours, Thou lookst like an asse, why, whether would you fish face 2 Cit. If I might have But the honour to see you at my poore house sir, A Capon bridled, and sadled I'le assure your worship, A shoulder of mutton, and a pottle of wine sir; I know your brother, he was as like ye, And shot the best at butsâ 1 Ush. Aâupon thee. 2 Cit. Some musick I'le assure you too, My toy sir, can play o'th' virginals. 1 Ush. Prethee good toy, Take away thy shoulder of mutton, it is flie blowne, And shoulder take thy flap along, here's no place for ye; Nay then you had best be knock'd. Ex. Cit. Enter Celia. Cel. I wou'd faine see him The glory of this place, makes me remember, But dye those thoughts, dye all but my desires, Even those to death are sicke too; he's not here, Nor how my eyes may guide meâ 1 Ush. What's your businesse? Who keeps the outward doore there? here's fine shufling, You wastcoater you must go backe. Cel. There is not, There cannot be, sixe dayes and never see me? There must not be desire; sir do you thinke That if you had a Mistrisâ 1 Ush. Death, she is mad. Cel. And were your selfe an honest man? it cannotâ 1 Ush. What a devill hast thou to do with me or my honesty? Will you be jogging, good nimble tongue, My fellow doore keeper. 2 Ush. Prethee let her alone. 1 Ush. The King is comming, And shall we have an agent from the suburbs Come to crave audience too? Cel. Before I thought ye To have a little breeding, some tang of Gentry; But now I take ye plainly, Without the helpe of any perspective, For that ye cannot alter. 1 Ush. What's that? Cel. An asse sir, you bray as like one, And by my troth, me thinkes as ye stand now, Considering who to kick next, you appeare to me Just with that kind of gravity, and wisdome; Your place may beare the name of Gentleman, But if ever any of that butter stick to your breadâ 2 Ush. You must be modester. Cel. Let him use me nobler, And weare good cloaths to do good offices; They hang upon a fellow of his vertue, As though they hung on Gibbets. 2. Ush. A perilous wench. 1 Ush. Thrust her into a corner, I'le no more on her. 2 Ush. You have enough, goe pretty maid, stand close, And use that little tongue, with a little more temper. Cel. I thanke ye sir. 2 Ush. When the shews are past, I'le have ye into the cellar, there wee'l dine A very pretty wench, a witty rogue, And there wee'l be as merry, can ye be merry? Cel. O very merry. 2 Ush. Only our selves; this churlish fellow shall not know. Cel. By no meanes. 2 Ush. And can you love a little? Cel. Love exceedingly: I have cause to love you deare sir. 2 Ush. Then I'le carry ye, And shew you all the pictures, and the hangings, The lodgings, gardens, and the walkes: and then (sweet) You shall tell me where you lye. Cel. Yes marry will I. 2. Ush. And't shall go hard but I'le send ye a venison pastie, And bring a bottle of wine along. 1. Ush. Make roome there. 2. Ush. Room there afore, stand close, the train is coming Enter King, Antigonous, Tymon, Charinthus, Menippus. Cel. Have I yet left a beauty to Catch fooles? Yet, yet, I see him not, O what a miserie Is love, expected long, deluded longer! Ant. Conduct in the Embassadors. 1. Ush. Make roome there. Ant. They shall not wait long answerâ Flourish Cel. Yet he comes not. Ent. 3 Embassadors. Why are eyes set on these, and multitudes Follow to make these wonders? O good gods! What would these looke like if my love were here? But I am fond, forgetfull. Ant. Now your grievance, Speake short, and have as short dispatch. 1. Em. Then thus sir: In all our Royall Masters names, We tell you Ye have done injustice, broke the bonds of concord, And from their equall shares, from Alexander Parted, and so possess'd, not like a brother, But as an open Enemie, Ye have hedged in Whole Provinces, man'd and maintain'd these injuries; And daily with your sword (though they still honor ye) Make bloudy roades, take Townes, and ruine Castles, And still their sufferance feeles the waight. 2. Em. Think of that love great sir, that honor'd friendship Your selfe hold with our Masters, thinke of that strength When you were all one body, all one minde; When all your swords strook one way, when your angers, Like so many brother billowes rose together, And curling up your foaming crests, defied Even mighty Kings, and in their fals, entomb'd 'em; O thinke of these; and you that have been Conquerours, That ever led your fortunes open ey'd, Chain'd fast by confidence; you that fame courted, Now ye want enemies and men to match ye; Let not your owne swords seeke your ends to shame ye. Enter Demetrius with a Javelin, and Gentlemen. 3 Emb. Choose which you will, or peace or war, We come prepar'd for either. 1 Ush. Roome for the Prince there. Cel. was it the Prince they said? how my heart trembl'd! 'Tis he indeed; what a sweet noble fiercenesse Dwels in his eyes? young Meleager like, When he returnd from slaughter of the Boare, Crown'd with the loves and honours of the people, With all the gallant youth of Greece, he lookes now, Who could deny him love? Dem. Haile Royall Father. Ant. Ye are welcome from your sport sir, do you see this, You that bring thunders in your mouthes, and earthquakes gent. To shake and totter my designes? can you imagine (You men of poore and common apprehensions) Whilst I admit this man, my son, this nature That in one looke carries more fire, and fiercenesse, Then all your masters in their lives: dare I admit him, Admit him thus, even to my side, My bosome, When he is fit to rule, when all men cry him, And all hopes hang about his head; thus place him, His weapon hatcht in bloud, all these attending When he shall make their fortunes, all as sudden In any expedition he shall point 'em, As arrowes from a Tartars bow, and speeding, Dare I do this, and feare an enemy? Feare your great Master? yours? or yours? Dem. O Hercules, Who saies you do sir? Is there any thing In these mens faces, or their Masters actions, Able to worke such wonders? Cel. Now 'a speakes: O I could dwell upon that tongue for ever. Dem. You call 'em Kings, they never wore those roialties Nor in the progresse of their lives ariv'd yet At any thought of King: emperiall dignities, And powerfull god-like actions, fit for Princes They can no more put on, and make 'em sit right, Then I can with this mortall hand hold heaven: Poore petty men, nor have I yet forgot The chiefest honours time, and merit gave 'em: Lysimachus your Master, at his best, His highest, and his hopefull'st dignities Was but grand-master of the Elephants; Seleucus of the Treasure; and for Ptolomy, A thing not thought on then, scarce heard of yet, Some master of amunition: and must these menâ Cel. What a brave confidence flowes from his spirit? O sweet young man! Dem. Must these hold pace with us, And on the same field hang their memories? Must these examine what the wils of Kings are? Prescribe to their designes, and chaine their actions To their restraints? be freinds, and foes when they please? Send out their thunders, and their menaces, As if the fate of mortall thinge were theirs? Go home good men, and tell your masters from us, We do 'em too much honour to force from 'em Their barren countries, ruine their vast Cities, And tell 'em out of love, we meane to leave 'em (Since they will needs be Kings) no more to tread on, Then they have able wits, and powers to manage, And so we shall befriend 'em: ha? what does she there? Emb. This is your answer King. Ant. 'Tis like to prove so. Dem. Fie sweet, what make you here? Cel. Pray ye do not chide me. Dem. You do your selfe much wrong, and me. Cel. Pray you pardon me, I feele my fault, which only was committed Through my deare love to you: I have not seen ye, And how can I live then? I have not spoke to yeâ Dem. I know this weeke ye have not; I will redeem all. You are so tender now: thinke where you are, sweet. Cel. What other light have I left? Dem. Prethee Celia, Indeed, I'le see ye presently. Cel. I have done sir: You will not misse? Dem. By this, and this, I will not. Cel. 'Tis in your will: and I must be obedient. Dem. No more of these assemblies. Cel. I am commanded. 1 Ush. Roome for the Lady there: Madam, my serviceâ 1 Gent. My Coach and't please you Lady. 2 Ush. Roome before there. 2 Gent. The honour Madam, but to waite upon youâ Cel. My servants, and my state: Lord, how they flocke now? Before I was affraid they would have beat me; How these flies play i'th Sunshine? pray ye no services, Or if ye needs must play the hobby horses, Seek out some beautie that affects 'em: farewell, Nay pray ye spare: Gentlemen I am old enough To go alone at these yeares, without crutches. Exit. 2. Ush. Wel, I could curse now: but that will not help me, I made as sure account of this wench now, immediately, Do but consider how the devill has crost me, Meate for my Master she cries, wellâ 3 Em. Once more sir, We aske your resolutions: peace or war yet? Dem. War, war, my noble father. 1 Em. Thus I fling it: And faire ey'd peace, farewell. Ant. You have your answer; Conduct out the Embassadours, and give 'em convoies. Dem. Tell your high hearted Masters, they shall not seek us, Nor coole i'th' field in expectation of us, Wee'l ease your men those marches: In their strengths, And full abilities of mind and courage, Wee'l ffnd 'em out, and at their best trim buckle with 'em 3 Em. You will find so hot a Souldiers welcome sir, Your favor shall not freeze, 2 Em. A forward Gentleman, Pitty the wars should bruise such hopesâ Ant. Conduct 'emâ Ex. Em. Now, For this preparation: where's Leontius? Call him in presently: for I meane in person Gentlemen My selfe, with my old fortuneâ Dem. Royall sir: Thus low I beg this honour: fame already Hath every where rais'd trophies to your glory, And conquest now grown old, and weake with following The weary marches, and the bloudy shockes You daily set her in: 'tis now scarce honour Fo you that never knew to fight, but conquer, To sparkle such poore people: the roiall Eagle When she hath tri'd her young ones gainst the Sun, And found 'em right; next teacheth 'em to prey, How to command on wing, and check below her Even birds of noble plume; I am your owne sir, You have found my spirit, trie it now, and teach it, To stoop whole kingdomes: leave a little for me; Let not your glory be so greedy sir, To eate up all my hopes; you gave me life, If to that life you adde not what's more lasting, A noble name, for man you have made a shadow: Blesse me this day: bid me go on, and lead, Bid me go on, no lesse fear'd, then Antigonus, And to my maiden sword, tye fast your fortune; I know 'twill fight it selfe then: deare sir honour me: Never faire virgin long'd so. Ant. Rise, and command then, And be as fortunate as I expect ye: I love that noble will; your young companions Bred up and foster'd with ye, I hope Demetrius, Enter Leon. You will make souldiers too: they must not leave ye. 2 Gent. Never till life leave us sir. Ant. O Leontius, Here's worke for you in hand. Leon. I am ev'n right glad sir. For by my troath, I am now grown old with idlenesse; I heare we shall abroad sir. Ant. Yes, and presently, But who thinkes you commands now? Leon. Who commands sir? Methinkes mine eye should guide me: can there be (If you your selfe will spare him so much honour) Any found out to lead before your armies, So full of faith, and fire as brave Demetrius? King Philips Son, at his yeares was an old Souldier, 'Tis time his fortune be a wing, high time sir, So many idle houres, as here he loyters, So many ever-living names he loses, I hope 'tis he. Ant. 'Tis he indeed, and nobly He shall set forward: draw you all those Garrisons Upon the frontiers as you passe: to those Joyne these in pay at home, our ancient souldiers, And as you go presse all the Provinces. Leo. We shall not need; Beleeve this hopefull Gentleman Can want no swords, nor honest hearts to follow him, We shall be full, no feare sir. Ant. You Leontius, Because you are an old, and faithfull servant, And know the wars, with all his vantages, Be neare to his instructions, least his youth Lose valours best companion, staid discretion, Shew where to lead, to lodge, to charge with safetie; In execution not to breake, nor scatter, But with a provident anger, follow nobly: Not covetous of bloud, and death, but honour, Be ever neare his watches; cheere his labours, And where his hope stands faire, provoke his valour; Love him, and thinke it no dishonour (my Demetrius) To weare this Jewell neare thee; he is a tri'd one, And one that even in spight of time, that sunke him, And frosted up his strength, will yet stand by thee. And with the proudest of thine enemies Exchange for bloud, and bravely: take his counsell. Leo. Your grace hath made me young again, and wanton. Ant. She must be known and suddenly; when you have done Come in and take your leave sir, and some few Prayers along. Ant. Do ye know her? Gent., Char. No, beleeve sir. Ant. Did you observe her Tymon? Tym. I look'd on her, But what she isâ Ant. I must have that found. Tym. Well sir. Dem. I know my duty, Exit. Ant. You shall be halfe my father. Leo. All your Servant: Come Gentlemen, you are resolv'd I am sure To see these wars. 1 Gent. We dare not leave his fortunes, Though most assured death hung round about us. Leo. That bargaines yet to make; Be not too hasty, when ye face the Enemie, Nor too ambitious to get honour instantly, But charge within your bounds, and keepe close bodies, And you shall see what sport wee'l make these mad-caps; You shall have game enough, I warrant ye, Every mans Cock shall fight. Dem. I must go see sir: Brave sir, as soone as I have taken leave, I'le meet you in the Parck; Draw the men thether, Waite you upon Leontius. Gent. Wee'l attend sir. Lie. But I beseech your Grace, with speed; the sooner We are i'th' fieldâ Dem. You could not please me better. Exit. Leo. You never saw the wars yet? Gent. Not yet Collonell. Leo. These foolish Mistrisses do so hang about ye, So whimper, and so hug, I know it Gentlemen, And so intice ye, now ye are i'th' bud; And that sweet tilting war, with eies and kisses, Th'allarums of soft vowes, and sighes, and fiddle faddles, Spoiles all our trade: You must forget these knick knacks, A woman at some time of yeare, I grant ye She is necessarie; but make no busines of her; How now Lieutenant? Ent. Lieutenant. Lieu. Oh sir, as ill as ever; We shall have wars they say; they are mustring yonder: Would we were at it once: fie, how it plagues me. Le. Here's one has served now under Captaine Cupid, And crackt a Pike in's youth: you see whats come on't. Lieu. No, my disease will never prove so honourable. Le. Why sure, thou hast the best pox. Lieu. If I have 'em, I am sure I got 'em in the best companie; They are pox of thirty Coates. Le. Thou hast me wed 'em finely: Here's a strange fellow now, and a brave fellow, If we may say so of a pockie fellow, (Which I beleeve we may) this poore Lieutenant; Whether he have the scratches, or the scabs, Or what a devill it be, I'le say this for him, There fights no braver souldier under Sun, gentlemen; Show him an Enemie, his paine's forgot straight; And where other men, by beds and bathes have ease, And easie rules of phisick, set him in a danger, A danger, thats a fearfull one indeed, Ye rock him, and he will so play about ye, Let it be ten to one, he ne're comes off againe; Ye have his heart: and then he works it bravely, And throughly bravely: not a pang remembred: I have seen him do such things, beliefe would shrinke at. Gent. 'Tis strange he should do all this, and diseas'd so. Leo. I am sure 'tis true: Lieutenant, canst thou drink wel? Lieu. Would I were drunk, dog-drunk, I might not feele this. Gent. I would take Phisicke. Lieu. But I would know my disease first. Leon. Why? it may be the Collique: canst thou blow backward? Lieu. There's never a bag-pipe in the kingdom better. Gent. Is't not a pluresie? Lieu. 'Tis any thing That has the devill, and death in't: will ye march Gentlemen? The Prince has taken leave. Leo. How know ye that? Lie. I saw him leave the Court, dispatch his followers, And met him after in a bye street: I thinke He has some wench, or such a toy, to lick over Before he goe: would I had such another To draw this foolish paine downe. Leo. Let's away Gentlemen, For sure the Prince will stay on us. Gent. Wee'l attend sir. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 2. Enter Demetrius, and Celia. Cel. Must ye needs go? Dem. Or stay with all dishonour. Cel. Are there not men enough to fight? Dem. Fie Celia, This ill becomes the noble love you beare me; Would you have your love a coward? Cel. No; beleeve sir, I would have him fight, but not so far off from me. Dem. Wouldst have it thus? or thus? Cel. If that be fightingâ Dem. Ye wanton foole: when I come home againe I'le fight with thee, at thine weapon Celia, And conquer thee too. Cel. That you have done already, You need no other Armes to me, but these sir; But will you fight your selfe sir? Dem. Thus deep in bloud wench, And through the thickest rankes of Pikes. Cel. Spur bravely, Your firie Courser, beat the troopes before ye, And crambe the mouth of death with executions. Dem. I would do more then these: But prethee tell me, Tell me my faire, where got'st thou this male spirit? I wonder at thy mind. Cel. Were I man then, You would wonder more. Dem. Sure thou wouldst prove a Souldier, And some great Leader. Cel. Sure I should do somewhat; And the first thing I did, I should grow envious, Extreamely envious of your youth, and honour. Dem. And fight against me? Cel. Ten to one, I should do it. Dem. Thou wouldst not hurt me? Cel. In this mind I am in, I thinke I should be hardly brought to strike ye, Unlesse 'twere thus; but in my mans mindâ Dem. What? Cel. I should be friends with ye too, Now I thinke better. Dem. Ye are a tall Souldier: Here, take these, and these; This gold to furnish ye, and keepe this bracelet; Why do you weep now? You a masculine spirit? Cel. No, I confesse I am a foole, a woman: And ever when I part with youâ Dem. You shall not, These teares are like prodigious signes, my sweet one, I shall come backe, loden with fame, to honour thee. Cel. I hope you shall: But then my deare Demetrius, When you stand Conquerour, and at your mercy All people bow, and all things waite your sentence; Say then your eye (surveying all your conquest) Finds out a beautie, even in sorrow excellent, A constant face, that in the midst of ruine With a forc'd smile, both scornes at fate, and fortune: Say you find such a one, so nobly fortified. And in her figure, all the sweets of nature? Dem. Prethee, No more of this, I cannot find her. Cel. That shews as far beyond my wither'd beauty; And will run mad, to love ye too. Dem. Do you feare me, And do you thinke, besides this face, this beauty, This heart, where all my hopes are lock'dâ Cel. I dare not: No sure, I think ye honest; wondrous honest. Pray doe not frowne, Ile swear ye are. Dem. Ye may choose. Cel. But how long will ye be away? Dem. I know not. Cel. I know you are angry now: pray look upon me: Ile aske no more such questions. Dem. The Drums beat, I can no longer stay. Cel. They doe but call yet: How faine you would leave my company. Dem. I wou'd not, Unlesse a greater power then love commanded, Commands my life, mine honour. Cel. But a little. Dem. Prethee farewell, and be not doubtfull of me. Cel. I would not have ye hurt: and ye are so ventrousâ But good sweet Prince preserve your selfe, fight nobly, But do not thrust this body, 'tis not yours now, 'Tis mine, 'tis onely mine: doe not seek wounds, Sir, For every drop of bloud you bleedâ Dem. I will Celia, I will be carefull. Cel. My heart, that loves ye deerely. Dem. Prethee no more, we must part: Harke, they march now. Drums a March. Cel. Pox on these bawling Drums: I am sure you'll kisse me, But one kisse? what a parting's this? Dem. Here take me, And doe what thou wilt with me, smother me; But still remember, if your fooling with me, Make me forget the trustâ Cel. I have done: farewell sir, Never look back, you shall not stay, not a minute. Dem. I must have one farewell more. Cel. No, the Drums beat; I dare not slack your honour; not a hand more, Onely this look; the gods preserve, and save ye.</field>

Men. I have found her sir, I meane the place she is lodg'd in; her name is Celia, And much a doe I had to purchase that too. Ant. Dost think Demetrius loves her? Men.

There lies the marrow of the matter hid yet. Ant. Has't thou been with thy wife? Men. No sir, I am going to her. Ant. Goe and dispatch, and meet me in the garden, And get all out ye can. Exit. Men. Ile doe my best sir. Exit. Tym. Blest be thy wife, thou wert an arrant asse else. Char. I, she is a stirring woman indeed: There's a braine, brother. Tym. There's not a handsome wench of any mettle VVithin an hundred miles, but her intelligence Reaches her, and out-reaches her, and brings her As confidently to Court, as to a sanctuary: VVhat had his mouldy braines ever arriv'd at, Had not she beaten it out oth' Flint to fasten him? They say she keeps an office of Concealements: There is no young wench, let her be a Saint, Unlesse she live ith' Center, but she findes her, And every way prepares addresses to her: If my wife would have followed her course Charinthus, Her lucky course, I had the day before him: O what might I have been by this time, Brother? But she (forsooth) when I put these things to her, These things of honest thrift, groans, Ã´ my conscience, The load upon my conscience, when to make us cuckolds, They have no more burthen then a brood-goose, brother; But let's doe what we can, though this wench faile us, Another of a new way will be lookt at: Come, let's abroad, and beat our brains, time may For all his wisedome, yet give us a day. Ex. ScÃ¦ne. 2. Drum within, Allarme, Enter Demetrius and Leontius. Dem. I will not see 'em fall thus, give me way sir, I shall forget you love me else. Leo. VVill ye lose all? For me to be forgotten, to be hated, Nay never to have been a man, is nothing, So you, and those we have preserv'd from slaughter Come safely off. Dem. I have lost my selfe. Leo. You are cozn'd. Dem. And am most miserable. Leo. There's no man so, but he that makes himself so. Dem. I will goe on. Leo. You must not: I shall tell you then, And tell you true, that man's unfit to governe, That cannot guide himselfe: you lead an Army? That have not so much manly suff'rance left yee, To beare a losse? Dem. Charge but once more Leontius, My friends and my companions are engag'd all. Leo. Nay give 'em lost, I saw 'em off their horses, And the enemy master of their Armes; nor could then, The policie, nor strength of man redeem 'em. Dem. And shall I know this, and stand fooling? Leo. By my dead fathers soule you stir not, sir, Or if you doe, you make your way through me first. Dem. Thou art a Coward. Leo. To prevent a Madman. None but your fathers Son, durst call me so, 'Death if he didâMust I be scandall'd by ye, That hedg'd in all the helps I had to save ye? That, where there was a valiant weapon stirring, Both search'd it out, and singl'd it, unedg'd it, For feare it should bite you, am I a coward? Goe, get ye up, and tell 'em ye are the Kings Sonne; Hang all your Ladies favours on your Crest, And let them fight their shares; spurre to destruction, You cannot misse the way: be bravely desperate, And your young friends before ye, that lost this battell, Your honourable friends, that knew no order, Cry out, Antigonus, the old Antigonus, The wise and fortunate Antigonus, The great, the valiant, and the fear'd Antigenus, Has sent a desperate sonne, without discretion To bury in an houre his age of honor. Dem. I am ashamed. Leo. 'Tis ten to one, I die with ye: The coward will not long be after ye; I scorne to say I saw you fall, sigh for ye, And tell a whining tale, some ten yeares after To boyes and girles in an old chimney corner, Of what a Prince we had, how bravely spirited; How young and faire he fell: wee'l all goe with ye, And ye shall see us all, like sacrifices In our best trim, fill up the mouth of ruine, Will this faith satisfie your folly? can this show ye, Tis not to die we feare, but to die poorely, To fall, forgotten, in a multitude? If you will needs tempt fortune now she has held ye, Held ye from sinking up. Dem. Pray doe not kill me, These words pierce deeper then the wounds I suffer, The smarting wounds of losse. Leo. Ye are too tender; Fortune has houres of losse, and houres of honor, And the most valiant feele them both: take comfort, The next is ours, I have a soule descries it: The angry bull never goes backe for breath, But when he meanes to arme his fury double. Let this day set but not the memorie, And we shall find a time: How now Lieutenant? Enter Lieutenant. Lieu. I know not: I am mall'd: we are bravely beaten, All our young gallants lost. Leo. Thou art hurt. Lieu. I am pepper'd, I was i'th' midst of all: and bang'd of all hands: They made an anvile of my head, it rings yet; Never so thresh'd: do you call this fame? I have fam'd it; I have got immortall fame, but I'le no more on't; I'le no such scratching Saint to serve hereafter; 'O my conscience I was kill'd above twenty times, And yet I know not what a Devil's in't, I crawled away, and lived againe still; I am hurt plaguily, But now I have nothing neere so much paine Colonell, They have sliced me for that maladie. Dem. All the young men lost? Lie. I am glad you are here: but they are all i'th' pound sir, They'l never ride o're other mens corne againe, I take it, Such frisking, and such flaunting with their feathers, And such careering with their mistres favours; And here must he be pricking out for honor, And there got he a knocke, and downe goes pilgarlike, Commends his soule to his she-saint, and exit. Another spurres in there, cryes make roome villaines, I am a Lord, scarce spoken, but with reverence A rascall takes him o're the face, and fels him; There lyes the Lord, the Lord be with him. Leo. Now sir, Doe you find this truth? Leo. I would not. Lieu. Pox upon it, They have such tender bodies too; such Cullisses, That one good hansome blow breaks 'em a pieces. Leo. How stands the Enemie? Lieu. Even coole enough too: For to say truth he has bin shrewdly heated, The gentleman no doubt will fall to his jewlips. Leo. He marches not i'th' taile on's. Lieu. No, plague take him, Hee'l kisse our tailes as soone; he lookes upon us, As if he would say, if ye will turne againe, friends, We will belabor you a little better, And beat a little more care into your coxcombs. Now shall we have damnable Ballads out against us, Most wicked madrigals: and ten to one Colonell, Sung to such lowsie, lamentable tunes. Leo. Thou art merrie, How e're the game goes: good sir be not troubled, A better day will draw this backe againe. Pray goe, and cheere those left, and lead 'em off, They are hot, and wearie. Dem. I'le doe any thing. Leo. Lieutenant, send one presentlie away To'th' King, and let him know our state: and harke ye, Be sure the messenger advise his Majestie To comfort up the Prince: hee's full of sadnes. Lieu. When shall I get a Surgeon? this hot weather, Unlesse I be well pepper'd, I shall stinke Colonel. Leo. Goe, I'le prepare thee one. Lieu. If ye catch me then, Fighting againe, I'le eat hay with a horse. Ex. ScÃ¦ne 3. Enter Leucippe (reading) and two Maids at a Table, writing. Leu. Have ye written to Merione? 1. Ma. Yes, Madam. Leu.

Maid. Very well, Madam, Though very much adoe, I had to make her Apprehend that happinesse. Leu. These kinde are subtile: Did she not cry and blubber when ye urg'd her. 1. Maid. O most extremly, &amp; swore she would rather perish. Leu. Good signes, very good signes, Symptomes of easie nature. Had she the plate? 1. Maid. She lookt upon't, and left it, And turn'd againe, and view'd it. Leu. Very well still. 1 Maid. At length she was content to let it lye there, Till I call'd for't, or so, Leu. She will come? 1. Maid.

Enter Antigonus, Tymon, Lords, and a Souldier. Ant. No face of sorrow for this losse? 'twill choake him, Nor no man misse a friend, I know his nature So deep imprest with griefe, for what he has suffer'd, That the least adding to it, adds to his ruine; His losse is not so infinite, I hope Souldier. Soul. Faith neither great, nor out of discretion, The young men out of heate. Enter Demetrius, Leontius, and Lieutenant. Ant. I ghesse the manner. Lord Men. The Prince and't like your Graceâ Ant. You are welcome home sir; Come, no more sorrow, I have heard your fortune, And I my self haue tride the like: cleare up man, I will not have ye take it thus; if I doubted. Your feare had lost; and that you had turn'd your back to 'em, Basely besought their merciesâ Leo. No, no, by this hand sir, We fought like honest and tall men. Antig. I know't Leontius; or if I thought Neglect of rule, having his councell with ye, Or too vaine-glorious appetite of fame, Your men forgot, and scatter'd. Leo. None of these sir, He shew'd himselfe a noble gentleman, Every way apt to rule. Ant. These being granted; Why should you think you have done an act so hainous, That nought but discontent dwells round about ye? I have lost a Battaile. Leo. I, and fought it hard too. Ant. With as much meanes as manâ Leo. Or devill could urge it. Ant. Twenty to one of our side now. Leo. Turne Tables, Beaten like dogs againe, like Owles, you take it To hart for flying but a mile before 'em, And to say truth, 'twas no flight neither sir, 'T was but a walke, a handsome walke, I have tumbl'd with this old body, beaten like a stock-fish, And stuck with arrowes, like an arming Quiver, Blouded and bang'd, almost a day before 'em, And glad I have got off then. Here's a mad shaver, He fights his share I am sure, when ere he comes to't; Yet I have seen him trip it tithely too, And cry the devill take the hindmost ever. Lieu. I learn'd it of my betters. Leo. Boudge at this? Ant. Has fortune but one face? Lieu. In her best vizard, Me thinks she looks but lowzily. Ant. Chance, though she faint now, And sink below our expectations, Is there no hope left strong enough to boy her? Dem. 'Tis not this day, I fled before the enemie, And lost my people, left mine honour murder'd, My mayden honour, never to be ransom'd, (VVhich to a noble soule is too too sencible) Afflicts me with this sadnesse; most of these, Time may turne straight againe, experience perfect, And new swords, cut new wayes to nobler fortunes. O I have lostâ Ant. As you are mine forget it: I doe not think it losse. Demet. O sir, forgive me, I have lost my friends, those worthy soules bred with me, I have lost my selfe, they were the pieces of me; I have lost all Arts, my Schooles are taken from me, Honour and Armes, no emulation left me: I liv'd to see these men lost, look'd upon it; These men that twin'd their loves to mine, their vertues, O shame of shames, I saw, and could not save 'em, This carries sulphure in't, this burnes and boyles me, And like a fatall Tombe bestrides my memorie. Antig. This was hard fortune, but if alive, and taken, They shall be ransom'd, let it be at Millions. Dem. They are dead, they are dead. Lieu. VVhen would he weep for me thus? I may be dead, and powder'd. Leo. Good Prince, grieve not: VVe are not certaine of their deaths: the enemy, Though he be hot, and keene, Yet holds good Quarter. VVhat noyse is this? Great Shout within, Enter Gentlemen. Lieu. He doe's not follow us? Give me a steeple top. Leo. They live, they live sir. Ant. Hold up your manly face; They live, they are here, Son. Dem. These are the men. 1 Gent. They are, and live to honour ye. Dem. How scap't ye noble friends? me thought I saw ye Even in the jawes of death. 2. Gent. Thanks to our folly, That spurr'd us on; we were indeed hedg'd round in't, And ev'n beyond the hand of succour beaten, Unhors'd, disarm'd: and what we lookt for then sir, Let such poore weary soules that heare the Bell knoll, And see the grave a digging, tell. Dem. For heaven sake Delude mine eyes no longer: how came ye off? 1. Gent. Against all expectation: the brave Seleucus, I thinke this day enamour'd on your vertue, VVhen, through the Troops, he saw ye shoot like lightning; And at your manly courage all tooke fire, And after that, the miserie we fell too, The never-certaine fate of war considering, As we stood all before him, fortunes ruines, Nothing but death expecting, a short time He made a stand upon our youths and fortunes, Then with an eye of mercy inform'd his judgement, How yet unripe we were, unblowne, unhardend, Unfitted for such fatall ends; he cryed out to us, Goe Gentlemen, commend me to your Master, To the most high, and hopefull prince Demetrius, Tell him the valour that he showed against me This day, the virgin valour, and true fire Deserves, even from an Enemie, this courtesie; Your lives and Armes freely I'le give 'em: thanke him, And thus we are return'd Sir. Leo. Faith 'twas well done; 'Twas bravely done; was't not a noble part Sir? Lieu. Had I been there up had I gone, I am sure on't; These noble tricks, I never durst trust 'em yet. Leo. Let me not live, and't were not a famed honestie, It takes me such a tickling way: now would I wish heaven, But ee'n the happines, ee'n that poore blessing For all the sharp afflictions thou hast sent me, But ee'n i'th' head o'th' field to take Seleucus. I should doe something memorable: fie, sad still. 1. Gent. Doe you grieve we are come off? Dem. Unransom'd, was it? 2. Gent. It was sir. Dem. And with such a fame to me? Said ye not so? Leo. Ye have heard it. Dem. O Leontius, Better I had lost 'em all: my selfe had perished, And all my fathers hopes, Leo. Mercy upon ye, VVhat ayle ye Sir? 'death, doe not make fooles on's, Neither goe to Church, nor tarry at home, That's a fine Horne-pipe? Ant. VVhat's now your griefe Demetrius? Dem. Did he not beat us twice? Leo. He beate a pudding; Beate us but once. Dem. Has beate me twice, and beat me to a coward, Beat me to nothing. Lieu. Is not the devill in him? Leo. I pray it be no worse. Dem. Twice conquer'd me. Leo. Bear witnesse all the world, I am a dunce here. Dem. With valour first he strook me, then with honour; That stroak Leontius, that strook, do'st thou not feele it? Leo. Where abouts was it? for I remember nothing yet. Dem. All these gentlemen That were his prisonersâ Leo. Yes, he set 'em free sir, With Armes and honour. Dem. There, there, now thou hast it; At mine owne weapon, Courtesie, h'as beaten me, At that I was held a Master in, he has cow'd me, Hotter then all the dint oth' fight he has charg'd me: Am I not now a wretched fellow? think on't; And when thou hast examin'd all wayes honourable, And find'st no doore left open to requite this, Conclude I am a wretch, and was twice beaten. Ant. I have observ'd your way, and understand it, And equall love it as Demetrius, My noble childe thou shalt not fall in vertue, I and my power will sink first: you Leontius, Wait for a new Commission, ye shall out againe, And instantly: you shall not lodge this night here, Not see a friend, nor take a blessing with ye, Before ye be ith'field: the enemy is up still, And still in ful dnsigne: Charge him againe, Son, And either bring home that againe thou hast lost there, Or leave thy body by him. Dem. Ye raise me, And now I dare look up againe, Leontius. Leo. I, I, sir, I am thinking who we shall take of 'em, To make all straight; and who we shall give toth' devill. VVhat saist thou now Lieutenant? Lieu. I say nothing. Lord what aile, I, that I have no minde to fight now? I finde my constitution mightily alter'd Since I came home: I hate all noises too, Especially the noise of Drums; I am now as well As any living man; why not as valiant? To fight now, is a kinde of vomit to me, It goes against my stomack. Dem. Good sir, presently; You cannot doe your Son, so faire a favour. Ant. 'Tis my intent: Ile see ye march away too; Come, get your men together presently, Leontius, And presse where please you, as you march. Leo. VVe goe sir. Ant. VVait you on me, Ile bring ye to your command, And then to fortune give you up. Dem. Ye love me. Ext. Leo. Goe, get the drums, beat round, Lieutenant. Lieu. Harke ye, sir, I have a foolish businesse they call marriage. Leo. After the wars are done. Lieu. The partie staies sir, I have giv'n the Priest his money too: all my friends sir, My father, and my mother. Leo. VVill you goe forward? Lieu. She brings a pretty matter with her. Leo. Halfe a dozen Bastards. Lieu. Some fortie sir. Leo. A goodly competency. Lieu. I meane sir, pounds a year; Ile dispatch the matter, 'Tis but a night or two; Ile overtake ye sir. Leo. The 2 old legions, yes: where lies the horse-quarter? Lieu. And if it be a boy, Ile even make bold sir. Leo. Away with your whore, A plague o' your whore, you damn'd rogue, Now ye are cur'd and well; must ye be clicketing? Lieu. I have broke my minde to my Ancient, in my absence, Hee's a sufficient gentleman. Leo. Get forward. Lieu. Onely receive her portion. Leo. Get ye forward; Else Ile bang ye forward. Lieu. Strange sir, A Gentleman and an officer cannot have the libertie To doe the office of a man. Leo. Shame light on thee, How came this whore into thy head? Lieu. This whore sir? 'Tis strange, a poore whore. Leo. Doe not answer me: Troop, Troop away; doe not name this whore againe, Or think there is a whore. Lieu. That's very hard sir. Leo. For if thou dost, look to't, Ile have thee guelded, Ile walk ye out before me: not a word more. Ex. ScÃ¦ne 5. Enter Leucippe, and Governesse. Leu. Ye are the Mistris of the house ye say, Where this young Ladie lies. Gov. For want of a better. Leu. You may be good enough for such a purpose: When was the Prince with her? answer me directly. Gover. Not since he went a warring. Leuc. Very well then: What carnall copulation are you privie too Between these two? be not afraid, we are women, And may talke thus amongst our selves, no harme in't. Gover. No sure, there's no harme in't, I conceive that; But truely, that I ever knew the gentlewoman Otherwise given, then a hopefull gentlewomanâ Leuc. You'll grant me the Prince loves her? Gov. There I am with ye. And the gods blesse her, promises her mightily. Leu. Stay there a while. And gives her gifts? Gov. Extreamly; And truely makes a very Saint of her. Leu. I should think now, (Good woman let me have your judgement with me, I see 'tis none of the worst: Come sit down by me) That these two cannot love so tenderly. Gov. Being so young as they are too. Leu. You say wellâ But that methinks some further promisesâ Gov. Yes, yes, I have heard the Prince sweare he would marry her. Leuc. Verie well still: they doe not use to fall out? Gov. The tenderest Chickens to one another, They cannot live an houre assunder. Leu. I have done then; And be you gone; you know your charge, and doe it. You know whose will it is; if you transgresse itâ That is, if any have accesse, or see her, Before the Kings will be fulfill'dâ Gov. Not the Prince, Madam? Leu. You'll be hang'd if you it, that Ile assure ye. Gov. But ne're the lesse, Ile make bold to obey ye. Leuc. Away, and to your businesse then. Gov. 'Tis done, Madam. Exeunt.</field>

I labour'd that, but cannot come to know it. A Greek I am sure she is, she speaks this language. Ant. Is she so excellent handsome? Men. Most inticing. Ant. Sold for a prisoner? Men. Yes sir, Some poore creature. Ant. And he loves tenderly? Men. They say extreamly. Ant. 'Tis well prevented then: yes, I perceiv'd it: When he took leave now, he made a hundred stops, Desir'd an houre, but halfe an houre, a minute, Which I with anger cross'd; I knew his businesse, I knew 'twas she he hunted on; this journey, man, I beat out suddenly for her cause intended, And would not give him time to breath. When comes she? Men. This morning sir. Ant. Lodge her to all delight then: For I would have her try'd toth' test: I know, She must be some crackt coyne, not fit his traffique, Which when we have found, the shame will make him leave her, Or we shal work a nearer way: Ile bury him, And with him all the hopes I have cast upon him, Ere he shall dig his owne grave in that woman: You know which way to bring her: Ile stand close there, To view her as she passes: and doe you hear Menippus, Observe her with all sweetnesse: humour her, 'T will make her lie more carelesse to our purposes. Away, and take what helpes you please. Men. I am gone sir. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 2. Enter Celia, and Governesse. Cel. Governesse, from whom was this Gown sent me? Prethee be serious true; I will not wear't else: 'Tis a handsome one. Gov. As though you know not? Cel. No faith: But I believe, for certaine too, yet I wonder, Because it was his caution, this poore way, Still to preserve me from the curious searchings Of greedy eyes. Gov. You have it: does it please you? Cel. 'Tis very rich, methinks too, prethee tell me? Gov. From one that likes you wel, never look coy, Lady; These are no gifts, to be put off with poutings. Cel. Powtings, and gifts? is it from any stranger? Gov. You are so curious, that there is no talk to ye. What if it be I pray ye? Cel. Unpin good Governesse, Quick, quick. Gov. Why, what's the matter? Cel. Quick, good Governesse: Fie on't, how beastly it becomes me? poorely? A trick put in upon me? well said Governesse: I vow I would not weare itâout, it smells musty. Are these your tricks? now I begin to smell it Abominable musty; will ye help me? The Prince will come againeâ Gov. You are not mad sure? Cel. As I live ile cut it off: a pox upon it; For sure it was made for that use; do you bring me Livories? Stales to catch Kites? dost thou laugh too, thou base woman? Gov. I cannot chuse, if I should be hang'd. Cel. Abuse me, And then laugh at me too? Gover. I doe not abuse ye: Is it abuse, to give him drink that's thirsty? You want cloathes; is it such a hainous sin I beseech ye, To see you stor'd? Cel. There is no greater wickednesse Then this way. Gov. What way? Cel. I shall curse thee fearefully, If thou provok'st me further: and take heed, woman; My curses never misse. Gov. Curse him that sent it. Cel. Tell but his nameâ Gov. You dare not curse him. Cel. Dare not? By this faire lightâ Gov. You are so full of passionâ Cel. Dare not be good? be honest? dare not curse him? Gov. I think you dare not: I beleeve so. Cel. Speak him. Gov. Up with your valour then, up with it bravely, And take your full charge. Cel. If I doe not, hang me; Tell but his name. Gov.

Curse o' my life: why dost thou vex me thus? I know thou meanst Demetrius, dost thou not? I charge thee speak truth: if it be any other, Thou knowst the charge he gave thee, and the justice His anger will inflict, if 'ere he know this, As know he shall, he shall, thou spightfull woman, Thou beastly woman; and thou shalt know too late too, And feele too sensible, I am no ward, No sale stuffe for your money Merchants that sent it? Who dare send me, or how durst thou, thouâ Gov. What you please: For this is ever the reward of service. The Prince shall bring the next himselfe. Cel. 'Tis strange That you should deale so peevishly: beshrew ye, You have put me in a heat. Gov. I am sure ye have kild me: I ne're receiv'd such language: I can but wait upon ye, And be your drudge; keep a poore life to serve ye. Cel. You know my nature is too easie, Governesse, And you know now, I am sorry too: how does he? Gov. O God, my head. Cel. Prethee be wel, and tell me, Did he speak of me, since he came? nay, see now, If thou wilt leave this tyranny? good sweet governesse, Did he but name his Celia? look upon me, Upon my faith I meant no harme: here, take this, And buy thy selfe some trifles: did a'good wench? Gov. He loves yee but too dearely. Cel. That's my good Governesse. Gov. There's more cloathes making for yee. Cel. More cloathes? Gov. More: Richer and braver; I can tell yee that newes; And twenty glorious things. Cel. To what use sirrah? Gov. Ye are too good for our house now: we poore wretches Shall lose the comfort of ye. Cel. No, I hope not. Gov. For ever lose ye Lady. Cel. Lose me? wherefore? I heare of no such thing. Gov. 'Tis sure it must be so: You must shine now at Court: such preparation, Such hurrie, and such hanging roomesâ Cel. Toth' Court wench? Was it toth' Court thou saidst? Gox. You'll finde it so. Cel. Staie, stay, this cannot be. Gov. I say it must be: I hope to finde ye still the same good Lady. Cel. Toth' Court? this stumbles me: art sure for me, wench, This preparation is? Gov. She is peilous crafty: I feare too honest for us all too. Am I sure I live? Cel. Toth' Court? this cannot down: what should I do there? Why should he on a suddain change his mind thus, And not make me acquainted? sure he loves me; His vow was made against it, and mine with him: At least while this King liv'd: he will come hither, And see me ere I goe? Gov. Wou'd some wise woman Had her in working: that I think he will not, Because he means with all joy there to meet ye. Ye shall heare more within this houre? Cel. A Courtier? What may that meaning be? sure he will see me If he be come, he must: Hark ye good Governesse, What age is the King of? Gov. Hee's an old man, and full of businesse. Cel. I feare too full indeed: what Ladies are there? I would be loath to want good company. Gov. Delicate young Ladies, as you would desire; And when you are acquainted, the best company. Cel. 'Tis very well: prethee goe in, let's talk more. For though I feare a trick, Ile bravely try it. Gov. I see he must be cunning, Knoks this Doe downe. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 3. Enter Lieutenant, &amp; Leontius. Drums within. Leo. You shal not have your wil, sirrah, are ye running? Have ye gotten a toy in your heeles? Is this a season, When honour pricks ye on, to prick your eares up, After your whore, your Hobby-horse? Lieu. Why look ye now: What a strange man are you? would you have a man fight At all houres all alike. Leo. Doe but fight something; But halfe a blow, and put thy stomack to't: Turne but thy face, and do but make mouthes at 'em. Lieu. And have my teeth knockt out; I thank ye heartily, Ye are my deare friend. Leo. What a devill ailes thee? Dost long to be hang'd? Lieu. Faith Sir, I make no suit for't: But rather then I would live thus out of charity, Continually in brawlingâ Leo. Art thou not he? I may be cozn'dâ Lie. I shall be discover'd. Leo. That in the midst of thy most hellish pains, When thou wert crawling sick, didst aime at wonders, When thou wert mad with paine? Lieu. Ye have found the cause out; I had ne're been mad to fight else: I confesse sir, The dayly torture of my side that vext me, Made me as dayly carelesse what became of me, Till a kinde sword there wounded me, and eas'd me; 'Twas nothing in my valour fought; I am well now, And take some pleasure in my life, methinks now, It shewes as mad a thing to me to see you scuffle, And kill one another foolishly for honour, As 'twas to you, to see me play the cox-combe. Leo. And wilt thou ne're fight more? Lieu. Ith' minde I am in, Leo. Nor never be sick againe? Lieu. I hope I shall not. Leo. Prethee be sick againe; prethee, I beseech thee, Be just so sick againe. Lieu. Ile just be hang'd first. Leo. If all the Arts that are can make a Chollique, Therefore look to't: or if imposthumes, marke me, As big as foot-balsâ Lieu. Deliver me. Leo. Or stones of ten pound weight ith' kidneyes, Through ease and ugly dyets may be gather'd; Ile feed ye up my selfe sir, Ile prepare ye, You cannot fight, unlesse the devill teare ye, You shall not want provocations, Ile scratch ye, Ile have thee have the tooth-ach, and the head-ach. Lieu. Good Colonell, Ile doe any thing. Leo. No, no, nothingâ Then will I have thee blowne with a paire of Smiths bellowes, Because ye shall be sure to have a round gale with ye, Fil'd full of oyle, o' devill, and Aqua fortis, And let these worke, these may provoke. Lieu. Good Colonell. Leo. A coward in ful bloud; prethee be plain with me, Will roasting doe thee any good? Lieu. Nor basting neither, sir. Leo. Marry that goes hard. Enter 1. Gent. 1 Gent. Where are you Colonell? The Prince expects ye sir; has hedg'd the enemy Within a straight, where all the hopes and valours Of all men living cannot force a passage, He has 'em now. Leo. I knew all this before sir, I chalk'd him out his way: but do you see that thing there? Lieu. Nay good sweet Colonell, Ile fight a little. Leo. That thing? 1. Gent. What thing? I see the brave Lieutenant. Leo. Rogue, what a name hast thou lost? Lieu. You may helpe it? Yet you may help't: Ile doe ye any courtesie: I know you love a wench well. Enter 2 Gent. Leo. Look upon him; Doe you look too. 2. Gent. What should I look on? I come to tell yee, the Prince stayes your direction, We have 'em now ith Coop, sir. Leo. Let 'em rest there, And chew upon their miseries: but look firstâ Lieu. I cannot fight for all this. Leo. Look on this fellow. 2 Gent. I know him; 'tis the valiant brave Lieutenant. Leo. Canst thou heare this, and play the rogue? steal off quickly, Behinde me quickly, neatly doe it, And rush into the thickest of the enemy, And if thou kill'st but two. Lieu. You may excuse me, 'Tis not my fault: I dare not fight. Leo. Be rul'd yet Ile beat thee on; goe wink and fight: a plague upon your sheeps heart. 2 Gent. What's all this matter? 1 Gent. Nay I cannot shew yee. Leo. Here's twenty pound, goe but smell to 'em. Lieu. Alas sir, I have taken such a cold I can smell nothing. Leo. I can smell a rascall, a ranke rascall: Fye, how he stinks, stinkes like a tyred Jade. 2 Gent. What sir? Leo. Why, that sir, doe not you smell him? 2. Gent. Smell him? Lieu. I must endure. Leo. Stinks like a dead dog, Carrionâ There's no such damnable smell under heaven, As the faint sweat of a Coward: will ye fight yet? Lie. Nay, now I defie ye; ye have spoke the worst ye can Of me, and if every man should take what you say To the heart.â Leo. God a mercy, God a mercy with all my heart; here I forgive thee; And fight, or fight not, doe but goe along with us, And keep my dog. Lieu. I love a good dog naturally. 1 Gent. What's all this stir, Lieutenant? Lieut. Nothing Sir, But a slight matter of argument. Leo. Pox take thee. Sure I shall love this rogue, he's so pretty a Coward, Come gentlemen, let's up now, and if fortune Dare play the slut againe, Ile never more Saint her, Come play fellow, come, prethee come up; come chicken, I have a way shall fit yet: A tame knave. Come, look upon us. Lieu. Ile tell ye who does best boyes. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 4. Enter Antigonus and Menippus above. Men. I saw her comming out, Ant. VVho waits upon her? Men.

How shews she in her trim now? Men. Oh most divinely sweet. Ant. Prethee speak softly. How does she take her comming? Men. She beares it bravely; But what she thinksâFor heaven sake sir preserve meâ If the Prince chance to finde this. Ant. Peace ye old foole; She thinks to meet him here. Men. That's all the Project. Ant. VVas she hard to bring? Men. No, she believ'd it quickly, And quickly made her selfe fit, the Gowne a little, And those new things she has not been acquainted with, At least in this place, where she liv'd a prisoner, Troubled and stirr'd her minde, But believe me sir, She has worne as good, they sit so apted to her; And she is so great a Mistris of disposure: Here they come now: but take a full view of her. Enter Celia, Tymon, Charinthus, and Gent. How cheerefully she looks? how she salutes all? And how she viewes the place? she is very yong sure: That was an admirable smile, a catching one, The very twang of Cupids bow sung to it: She has two-edg'd eyes, they kill o'both sides. Men. She makes a stand, as though she would speak. Ant. Be still then. Cel. Good Gentlemen, trouble your selves no further, I had thought sure to have met a noble friend here. Tym. Yee may meet many Lady. Cel. Such as you are I covet few or none, sir. Char. VVill you walk this way, And take the sweets otn' garden? coole and close, Lady. Cel. Methinks this open aire's farre better, tend ye that way. Pray where's the woman came along? Char. VVhat woman? Cel. The woman of the house I lay at. Tym. Woman? Here was none came along sure. Cel. Sure I am catcht then: Pray where's the Prince? Char. He will not be long from yee, We are his humble servants. Cel. I could laugh now, To see how finely I am cozn'd: yet I feare not, For sure I know a way to scape all dangers. Tym. Madam, your lodgings lye this way. Cel. My Lodgings? For heaven sake sir, what office doe I beare here? Ty. The great comander of all hearts Cel. You have hit it. Enter Leucippe, and Ladies. I thank your sweet-heart for it. Who are these now? Char. Ladies that come to serve yee. Cel. Well consider'd, Are you my servants? Lady. Servants to your pleasures. Cel. I dare believe ye, but I dare not trust ye: Catch'd with a trick? well, I must beare it patiently: Methinkes this Court's a neat place: all the people Of such refin'd a sizeâ Tym. This is no poore rogue. Leu. Were it a Paradice to please your fancy, And entertaine the sweetnesse you bring with ye; Cel. Take breath; You are fat, and many words may melt ye, This is three Bawdes beaten into one; blesse me heaven, What shall become of me? I am i'th' pitfall: O' my conscience, this is the old viper, and all these little ones Creep every night into her belly; do you heare plumpe servant And you my litle sucking Ladies, you must teach me, For I know you are excellent at carriage, How to behave my selfe, for I am rude yet: But you say the Prince will come? Lady. Will flie to see you. Cel. For look you if a great man, say the King now Should come and visit me? Men. She names ye. Ant. Peace foole. Cel. And offer me a kindnesse, such a kindnesse. Leu.

They'l count us basely bred. Leu. Not freely nurtur'd. Cel. I'le take thy counsell. Leu. 'Tis an excellent woman. Cel. I find a notable volume here, a learnd one; Which way? for I would faine be in my chamber; In truth sweet Ladies, I grow weary; fie, How hot the aire beats on me? Lady. This way Madam? Cel. Now by mine honour, I grow wondrous faint too. Leu. Your fans sweet Gentlewomen, your fans. Cel. Since I am foold, I'le make my self some sport, though I pay deare for't. Ex. Men. You see now what a manner of woman she is sir. Ant. Thou art an asse. Men. Is this a fit love for the Prince? Ant. A coxcombe: Now by my crowne a deintie wench, a sharpe wench, And a matchlesse spirit: how she Jeer'd 'em? How carelesly she scoff'd 'em? use her nobly; I would I had not seen her: waite anon, And then you shall have more to trade upon. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 5. Enter Leontius, and the 2 Gentlemen. Leo. We must keep a round, and a strong watch to night, The Prince will not charge the Enemy till the morning: But for the trick I told ye for this rascall. This rogue, that health and strong heart makes a coward. 1 Gent. I, if it take. Leo. Ne're feare it, the Prince has it, And if he let it fall, I must not know it; He will suspect me presently: but you two May helpe the plough. 2 Gent. That he is sicke again. Leo. Extreamely sicke: his disease growne incurable, Never yet found, nor touch'd at. Ent. Lieutenant. 2 Gent. Well, we have it And here he comes. Leo. The Prince has been upon him, What a flatten face he has now? it takes beleeve it; How like an asse he lookes? Lieu. I feele no great paine, At least, I thinke I do not; yet I feele sensibly I grow extreamely faint: how cold I sweat now? Leo. So, so, so. Lieu. And now 'tis ev'n too true, I feele a pricking, A pricking, a strange pricking: how it tingles? And as it were a stitch too: the Prince told me, And every one cri'd out I was a dead man; I had thought I had been as wellâ Leo. Upon him now boyes, And do it most demurely. 1 Gent. How now Lieutenant? Lieu. I thanke ye Gentlemen. 1 Gent. Life, how lookes this man? How dost thou good Lieutenant? 2 Gent. I ever told ye This man was never cur'd, I see it too plaine now; How do you feele your selfe? you looke not perfect, How dull his eye hangs? 1 Gent. That may be discontent. 2 Gent. Beleeve me friend, I would not suffer now The tith of those paines this man feeles; marke his forehead What a cloud of cold dew hangs upon't? Lieu. I have it, Againe I have it; how it growes upon me? A miserable man I am. Leo. Ha, ha, ha, A miserable man thou shalt be, This is the tamest trout I ever tickell'd. 1 Phis. This way he went. Enter 2 Phi. 2 Phis. Pray heaven we find him living, He's a brave fellow, 'tis pitty he should perish thus. 1 Phi. A strong hearted man, &amp; of a notable sufferance. Lieu. Oh, oh. 1 Gent. How now? how is it man? Lieu.

Do not discourage him. 1 Phi. He must be told truth, 'Tis now too late to trifle. Enter Dem. and Gent. 2 Gent. Here the Prince comes. Dem. How now Gentlemen? 2 Gent. Bewailing sir, a Souldier, And one I thinke, your Grace will grieve to part with, But every living thingâ Dem. 'Tis true, must perish, Our lives are but our martches to our graves, How dost thou now Lieutenant? Lieu. Faith 'tis true sir, We are but spans, and candles ends. Leo. He's finely mortified. Dem. Thou art heart whole yet; I see he alters strangely, And that a pace too; I saw it this morning in him, When he poore man, I dare sweareâ Lieu. No beleev't sir, I never felt it. Dem. Heres lies the paine now: how he is swel'd? 1 Phi. The Impostume Fed with a new malignant humour now, Will grow to such a bignesse, 'tis incredible, The compasse of a bushell will not hold it, And with such a hell of torture it will rise too.â Dem. Can you endure me touch it? Lieu. Oh, I beseech you sir: I feele you sensibly ere you come neare me. Dem. He's finely wrought, he must be cut, no cure else, And suddenlie, you see how fast he blowes out. Lieu. Good Master Doctor, let me be beholding to you, I feele I cannot last. 2 Phi. For what Lieutenant? Lieu. But ev'n for halfe a dozen Cans of good wine, That I may drinke my will out: I faint hideously. De. Fetch him some wine; and since he must go gentlemen Why let him take his journey merrily. Enter Servant with wine. Lieu. That's ev'n the nearest way. Leo. I could laugh dead now. Dem. Here, off with that. Lieu. These two I give your Grace, A poore remembrance of a dying man sir, And I beseech you weare 'em out. Dem. I will Souldier, These are fine legacies. Lieu. Among the Gentlemen, Even all I have left; I am a poore man, naked, Yet something for remembrance: foure a peece Gentlemen, And so my body where you please. Leo. It will worke. Lieu. I make your Grace my executor, and I beseech ye See my poore will fulfill'd: sure I shall walke else. Dem. As full as they can be fill'd, here's my hand Souldier. 1 Gent. The wine will tickle him. Lieu. I would heare a drum beat, But to see how I could endure it. Dem. Beat a drum there. Drum within. Lieu. Oh heavenly musick, I would heare one sing to't, I am very full of paine. Dem. Sing? 'tis imposible. Lieu. Why, then I would drinke a drum full: Where lies the Enemie? 2 Gent. Why, here close by. Leo. Now he begins to muster. Lieu. And dare ye fight? Dare ye fight Gentlemen? 1 Phi. You must not cut him: He's gone then in a moment; all the hope left, is To worke his weakenesse into suddaine anger, And make him raise his passion above his paine, And so dispose him on the enemie; His body then, being stir'd with violence, Will purge it selfe and breake the sore. Dem. 'Tis true sir. 1 Phi. And then my life for his. Lieu. I will not dye thus. Dem. But he is too weake to doeâ Lieu. Dye like a dog? 2 Phi. I, he's weake, but yet he's heart whole. Lieu. Hem. Dem. An excellent signe. Lieu. Hem. Dem. Stronger still, and better. Lieu. Hem, hem; ran, tan, tan, tan, tan. Exit. 1 Phi. Now he's i'th' way on't. De. Well go thy waies, thou wilt do something certain. Leo. And some brave thing, or let mine eares be cut off. He's finely wrought. Dem. Let's after him. Leo. I pray Sir; But how this rogue, when this cloud's melted in him, And all discover'd.â Dem. That's for an after mirth, away, away, away. Ex. ScÃ¦ne 6. Enter Seleucus, Lysimachus, Ptolomy, Souldiers. Sel. Let no man feare to dye: we love to sleep all, And death is but the sounder sleep; all ages, And all houres call us; 'tis so common, easie, That little children tread those paths before us; We are not sicke, nor our soules prest with sorrows, Nor go we out like tedious tales, forgotten; High, high we come, and hearty to our funerals, And as the Sun that sets, in bloud let's fall. Lis. 'Tis true, they have us fast, we cannot scape 'em, Nor keeps the brow of fortune one smile for us, Dishonourable ends we can scape though, And (worse then those, captivities) we can die, And dying nobly, though we leave behind us These clods of flesh, that are too massie burthens, Our living soules flie crown'd with living conquests. Ptol. They have begun, fight bravely, and fall bravely; And may that man that seekes to save his life now By price, or promise, or by feare fals from us, Never again be blest with name of Souldier. Enter a Souldier Sel. How now? who charged first? I seek a brave hand To set me oft in death. Soul. We are not charg'd sir, The Prince lies still. Sel. How comes this Larum up then? Sol. There is one desperate fellow, with the devill in him (He never durst do this else) has broke into us, And here he bangs ye two or three before him, There five or sixe; ventures upon whole companies. Ptol. And is not seconded? Soul. Not a man followes. Sel. Nor cut a peeces? Soul. Their wonder yet has staid 'em. Sel. Let's in, and see this miracle? Ptol. I admire it. Ex. Enter Leontius, and Gentlemen. Leon. Fetch him off, fetch him off; I am sure he's clouted; Did I not tell you how 't would take? 1 Gent. 'Tis admirable. Enter Lieutenant with colours in his hand, pursuing 3 or 4 Souldiers. Lieu. Follow that blow, my friend, there's at your coxcombs, I fight to save me from the Surgeons miseries. Leo. How the knave curries 'em? Lieu. You cannot rogues, Till you have my diseases, flie my furie, Ye bread and butter rogues, do ye run from me? And my side would give me leave, I would so hunt ye, Ye porredge gutted slaves, ye veale-broth boobies. Enter Demetrius, and Phisitians, and Gentlemen. Leo. Enough, enough Lieutenant, thou hast done bravely. Dem. Mirrour of man. Lieu. There's a flag for ye sir, I tooke it out o'th' shop, and never paid for't, I'le to 'em againe, I am not come to th'text yet. Dem. No more my souldier: beshrew my heart he is hurt sore. Leo. Hang him, hee'l lick all those whole. 1 Phi. Now will we take him, And cure him in a trice. Dem. Be carefull of him. Lieu. Let me live but two yeares, And doe what ye will with me; I never had but two houres yet of happinesse; Pray ye give me nothing to provoke my valour, For I am ev'n as weary of this fightingâ 2 Phi. Ye shall have nothing; come to the Princes Tent And there the Surgeons presently shall search ye, Then to your rest. Lieu. A little hansome litter To lay me in, and I shall sleepe. Leo. Looke to him. Dem. I do beleeve a horse begot this fellow, He never knew his strength yet; they are our owne. Leo. I thinke so, I am cozen'd else; I would but see now A way to fetch these off, and save their honours. Dem. Only their lives. Leo. Pray ye take no way of peace now, Unlesse it be with infinite advantage. Dem. I shall be rul'd; Let the battels now move forward, Our selfe will give the signall: Ent. Trumpet and HerÃ²ld. Now Herold, what's your message? Her. From my Masters This honourable courtesie, a Parley For halfe an houre, no more sir. Dem. Let 'em come on, They have my princely word. Enter Seleucus, Lysimacus, Ptolomy, attendants, Souldiers, Her. They are here to attend ye. Dem. Now Princes, your demands? Sel. Peace, if it may bee Without the too much tainture of our honour: Peace, and wee'l buy it too. Dem. At what price? Ly. Tribute. Ptol. At all the charge of this war. Leo. That will not do. Sel. Leontius, you and I have serv'd together, And run through many a fortune with our swords, Brothers in wounds, and health; one meat has fed us, One tent a thousand times from cold night cover'd us: Our loves have been but one; and had we died then, One monument had held our names, and actions: Why do you set upon your friends such prizes? And sacrifice to giddy chance such Trophies? Have we forgot to dye? or are our vertues Lesse in afflictions constant, than our fortunes? Ye are deceiv'd old souldier. Leo. I know your worths, And thus low bow in reverence to your vertues: Were these my wars, or lead my power in chiefe here, I knew then how to meet your memories: They are my Kings imployments; this man fights now, To whom I owe all dutie, faith, and service; This man that sled before ye; call backe that, That bloudy day againe, call that disgrace home, And then an easie peace, may sheath our swords up. I am not greedy of your lives and fortunes, Nor do I gape ungratefully to swallow ye, Honour the spur of all illustrious natures, That made you famous Souldiers, and next Kings, And not ambitious envy strikes me forward, Will ye unarme, and yeild your selves his prisoners? Sel. We never knew what that sound meant: no gives Shall ever bind this body, but embraces; Nor weight of sorrow here, till earth fall on me. Leo. Expect our charge then. Lys. 'Tis the nobler curtesie: And so we leave the hand of heaven to blesse us. Dem. Stay, have you any hope? Cel. We have none left us, But that one comfort of our deaths together; Give us but room to fight. Leo. Win it, and weare it. Ptol. Call from the hils those companies hang ore us Like bursting clouds; and then breake in, and take us. Dem. Find such a Souldier will forsake advantage, And wee'l draw off, to shew I dare be noble, And hang a light out to ye in this darkenesse, The light of peace; give up those Cities, forts, And all those frontire Countries to our uses. Sel. Is this the peace? traitours to those that feed us, Our Gods and people? give our Countries from us? Lis. Begin the knell, it sounds a great deale sweeter. Ptol. Let loose your servant death. Sel. Fall fate upon us, Our memories shall never stinke behind us. Dem. Seleucus, great Seleucus, Sol. The Prince cals sir. Dem. Thou stocke of noblenesse, and curtesie, Thou father of the warâ Leo. What meanes the Prince now? Dem. Give me my Standard here. Lys. His angers melted. Dem. You Gentlemen that were his prisoners, And felt the bounty of that noble nature, Lay all your hands, and beare these Colours to him, The Standard of the Kingdome; take it souldier. Ptol. What will this meane? Dem. Thou hast won it, beare it off, And draw thy men home whilst we waite upon thee. Sel. You shall have all our countries. Lys., Ptol. All by heaven sir. Dem. I will not have a stone, a bush, a bramble, No, in the way of curtesie, I'le start ye; Draw off, and make a lane through all the Armie, That these that have subdu'd us, may martch through us. Sel. Sir, do not make me surfet with such goodnesse, I'le beare your Srandard for ye; follow ye. Dem. I sweare it shall be so, martch through me fairely, And thine be this daies honour, great Seleucus. Ptol. Mirrour of noble minds. Dem. Nay then ye hate me. Leo. I cannot speake now: Ex with Drums, &amp; Shouts. Well, go thy wayes, at a sure peece of bravery Thou art the best, these men are won by th'neckes now: I'le send a post away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Antigonus, and Menippus. Ant. No aptnesse in her? Men. Not an immodest motion, And yet when she is as free, and when she is courted, Makes as wild witty answers. Ant. This more fires me, I must not have her thus. Men. We cannot alter her. Ant. Have ye put the youths upon her? Men. All that know any thing, And have been studied how to catch a beauty, But like so many whelps about an Elephantâ The Prince is coming home sir. Ant. I heare that too, But that's no matter; am I alter'd well; Men. Not to be knowne I thinke sir. Ant. I must see her. Ent. 2 Gent. or Lords. 1 Gent. I offered all I had, all I could thinke of, I tri'd her through all the points o'th' compasse, I thinke. 2 Gent. She studies to undo the Court, to plant here The enemy to our age, chastitie; She is the first, that ere bauked a close Arbour, And the sweet contents within: She hates curl'd heads too, And setting up of beards she sweares, is Idolatrie. 1 Gent. I never knew so faire a face so froze; Yet she would make one thinkeâ 2 Gent. True by her carriage, For she's as wanton as a kid toth' out side, As full of mocks and taunts: I kiss'd her hand too, Walkt with her halfe an houre. 1 Gent. She heard me sing, And sung her selfe too; she sings admirably; But still, when any hope was, as 'tis her trick To minister enough of those, then presently With some new slam or other, nothing to th'matter, And such a frowne, as would sinke all before her, She takes her chamber; come we shal not be the last fools. 2 Gent. Not by a hundred I hope; 'tis a strange wench. Ant. This screwes me up still higher. Enter Celia, and Ladies behind her Men. Here she comes sir. Ant. Then be you gone: and take the women with ye, And lay those Jewels in her way. Cel. If I stay longer I shall number as many lovers as Lais did; How they flocke after me? upon my conscience, I have had a dozen horses given me this morning, I'le ev'n set up a troop, and turne she-souldier. A good discreet wench now, that were not hidebound Might raise a fine estate here, and suddenly: For these warme things will give their soulesâI can go no where Without a world of offerings to my excellence: I am a Queene, a Goddesse, I know not whatâ And no constellation in all heaven, but I outshine it; And they have found out now I have no eyes Of mortall lights, but certaine influences, Strange vertuous lightnings, humane nature starts at, And I can kill my twenty in a morning, With as much ease nowâ Ha? what are these? new projects? Where are my honourable Ladies? are you out too? Nay then I must buy the stocke, send me good carding: I hope the Princes hand, be not in this sport; I have not seen him yet, cannot heare from him, And that, that, troubles me: all these were recreations Had I but his sweet companie to laugh with me: What fellowes that? another apparition? This is the lovingst age: I should know that face, Sure I have seen't before, not long since neither. Ant. She sees me now: O heaven, a most rare creature! Cel. Yes, 'tis the same: I will take no notice of ye, But if I do not fit ye, let me frie for't; Is all this Cackling for your eg? they are faire ones, Excellent rich no doubt to; and may stumble A good staid mind, but I can go thus by 'em; My honest friend; do you set off these Jewels; Ant. Set 'em off, Lady? Cel. I meane, sell 'em here sir? Ant. She's very quicke; for sale they are not meant sure. Cel. For sanctitie I thinke much lesse: good even Sir. Ant. Nay, noble Lady stay: 'tis you must weare 'em: Never looke strange, they are worthy your best beauty. Cel. Did ye speake to me? Ant. To you or to none living: To you they are sent; to you they are sacrificed. Cel. I'le never looke a horse i'th' mouth that's given: I thanke ye sir: I'le send one to reward ye. Ant. Do you never aske who sent 'em? Cel. Never I: Nor never care, if it be an honest end, That end's the full reward, and thankes but slubbers it; If it be ill, I will not urge the acquaintance. Ant. This has a soule indeed: pray let me tell ye. Cel. I care not if ye do, so you do it hansomly, And not stand picking of your words, Ant. The King sent 'em. Cel. Away, away, thou art some foolish fellow, And now I think thou hast stole 'em too; the king sent 'em? Alas good man, wouldst thou make me beleeve He has nothing to do with things of these worths, But wantonly to fling 'em? he's an old man, A good old man, they say too: I dare sweare Full many a yeare ago, he left these gambols: Here, take your trinkets. Ant. Sure I do not lye Lady. Cel. I know thou lyest extreamely, damnably. Thou hast a lying face. Ant. I was never thus ratled. Cel, But say I should beleeve: why are these sent me? And why art thou the Messenger? who art thou? Ant. Lady, looke on 'em wisely, and then consider Who can send such as these, but a King only? And, to what beautie can they be oblations, But only yours? For me that am the carrier, 'Tis only fit you know I am his servant, And have fulfil'd his will. Cel. You are short and pitthy; What must my beauty do for these? Ant. Sweet Lady, You cannot be so hard of understanding, When a Kings favour shines upon ye gloriously, And speakes his love in these,â Cel. O then love's the matter; Sir-reverence love: now I begin to feele ye: And I should be the Kings whore, a brave title. And go as glorious as the Sun, Ã´ brave still: The chiefe Commandresse of his Concubines, Hurried from place to place to meet his pleasures. Ant. A devillish subtill wench, but a rare spirit. Cel. And when the good old spunge had suckt my youth dry, And left some of his royall aches in my bones: When time shall tell me I have plough'd my life up, And cast long furrowes in my face to sinke me. Ant. You must not thinke so Lady. Cel. Then can these sir, These precious things, the price of youth and beauty; This shop here of sin-offerings set me off againe? Can it restore me chaste, young innocent? Purge me to what I was? adde to my memorie An honest and a noble fame? The Kings device; The sin's as universall as the Sun is, And lights an everlasting torch to shame me. Ant. Doe you hold so sleight account of a great Kings favour, That all knees bow to purchase? Cel. Prethee peace: If thou knewst how ill-favouredly thy tale becomes thee, And what ill root it takesâ Ant. You will be wiser. Cel. Could the King find no shape to shift his pander into, But reverend age? and one so like himself too? Ant. She has found me out. Cel. Cozen the world with gravitie? Prethee resolve me one thing, do's the King love thee? Ant. I thinke he doe's. Cel. It seemes so by thy office: He loves thy use, and when thats ended, hates thee: Thou seemest to me a souldier. Ant. Yes I am one. Cel. And hast fought for thy Country? Ant. Many a time. Cel. May be, commanded too? Ant. I have done, Lady. Cel. O wretched man, below the state of pitie! Canst thou forget, thou wert begot in honour? A free companion for a King? a souldier? Whose noblenesse dare feele no want, but enemies? Canst thou forget this, and decline so wretchedly, To eat the bread of bawdrie, of base bawdrie? Feed on the scum of sin? fling thy sword from thee? Dishonour to the noble name that nursed thee? Goe, beg diseases: let them be thy Armors, Thy fights, the flames of lust, and their foule issues. Ant. Why then I am a King, and mine owne speaker. Cel. And I as free as you, mine owne disposer; There take your jewels; let them give them lustres That have darke lives and soules; weare 'em your selfe sir, You'l seeme a Devill else. Ant. I command ye stay. Cel. Be just, I am commanded. Ant. I will not wrong ye. Cel. Then thus low fals my duty. Ant. Can ye love me? Say I, and all I have. Cel. I cannot love ye; Without the breach of faith I cannot heare ye; Ye hang upon my love, like frosts on Lillies: I can dye, but I cannot love: you are answer'd. Exit. Ant. I must find apter meanes, I love her truly. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 2. Ent. Demetr. Leon. Lieut. Gent. Sold. &amp; Host. Dem. Hether doe you say she is come? Host. Yes sir, I am sure on't: For whilst I waited on ye, putting my wife in trust, I know not by what meanes, but the King found her, And hether she was brought; how, or to what end. Dem. My father found her? Host. So my wife informes me. Dem. Leontius, pray draw off the souldiers, I would a while be private. Leon. Fall off Gentlemen, The Prince would be alone. Ex. Leo. &amp; Sol. Dem. Is he so cunning? There is some tricke in this, and you must know it, And be an agent too: which if it prove soâ Host. Pull me to pieces sir? Dem. My father found her? My father brought her hither? went she willingly? Host. My wife sayes full of doubts. Dem. I cannot blame her No more: there's no trust, no faith in mankinde. Enter Antigonus, Menippus, Leontius, &amp; Soldiers. Ant. Keep her up close, he must not come to see her: You are welcome nobly now, welcome home gentlemen; You have done a courteous service on the Enemie; Has tyed his faith for ever, you shall find it; Ye are not now in's debt Son: still your sad looks: Leontius, what's the matter? Leo. Truth sir, I know not, We have been merry since we went. Lieu. I feele it. Ant. Come, what's the matter now? do you want money? Sure he has heard o'th' wench. Dem. Is that a want sir? I would faine speake to your Grace. Ant. You may doe freely. Dem. And not deserve your anger? Ant. That ye may too. Dem. There was a gentle woman, and somtimes my prisoner, Which I thought well of sir: your Grace conceives me. Ant. I doe indeed, and with much grief conceive ye; With full as much griefe as your mother bare me: There was such a woman: would I might as well say, There was no such Demetrius. Dem. She was vertuous, And therefore not unfit my youth to love her: She was as faireâ Ant. Her beauty I'le proclaime too, To be as rich as ever raigned in woman; But how she made that good, the Devill knowes. Dem. She wasâO heaven! Ant. The hell to all thy glories, Swallowed thy youth, made ship wrack of thine honor: She was a devill. Dem. Ye are my father sir. Ant. And since ye take a pride to shew your follies, I'le muster 'em, and all the world shall view 'em. Leo. What heate is this? the Kings eyes speak his anger? Ant. Thou hast abus'd thy youth, drawn to thy fellowship Instead of arts and armes, a womans kisses, The subtilties, and soft heates of a harlot. Dem. Good sir, mistake her not. Ant. A Witch, a Sorcerer: I tell thee but the truth; and heare Demetrius, Which has so dealt upon thy bloud with charmes, Devillish and darke; so lockt up all thy vertues; So pluckt thee backe from what thou sprungst from, glorious In heaven, that any tongue but his durst say this; That any heart durst harbor it: Dread Father, If for the innocent the gods allow us To bend our kneesâ Ant. Away, thou art bewitched still; Though she be dead, her power still lives upon thee. Dem. Dead? O sacred sir: dead did you say? Ant. She is dead foole. Dem. It is not possible: be not so angry, Say she is falne under your sad displeasure, Or any thing but dead, say she is banished, Invent a crime, and doe beleeve it sir. Ant. Dead by the Law: we found her hell, and her, I meane her charmes and spels, for which she perish'd; And she confest she drew thee to thy ruine, And purpos'd it, purpos'd my Empires overthrow. Dem. But is she dead? was there no pity sir? If her youth err'd, was there no mercy shewne her? Did ye looke on her face, when ye condemn'd her? Ant. I look'd into her heart, and there she was hideous. Dem. Can she be dead? can vertue fall untimely? Ant. She is dead, deservingly she died. Dem. I have done then. O matchlesse sweetnes, whether art thou vanished? O thou faire soule of all thy sex, what Paradise Hast thou inrich'd and blest? I am your sonne sir, And to all you shall command stand most obedient, Only a little time I must intreat you To study to forget her; 'twill not be long sir, Nor I long after it: art thou dead Celia, Dead my poor wench? my joy, pluckt green with violence: O faire sweet floure, farwell: Come, thou destroyer, Sorrow, thou melter of the soule, dwell with me; Dwell with me solitarie thoughts, teares, cryings, Nothing that loves the day, love me, or seeke me, Nothing that loves his owne life haunt about me: And Love, I charge thee, never charme mine eies more, Nor ne're betray a beauty to my curses: For I shall curse all now hate all, forsweare all, And all the brood of fruitfull nature vex at, For she is gon that was all, and I nothingâ Ex. &amp; Gen. Ant. This opinion must be maintained. Men. It shall be sir. Ant. Let him goe: I can at mine owne pleasure Draw him to'th' right againe: wait you instructions, And see the souldier paid, Leontius: Once more ye are welcome home all. All. Health to your Majestie.â Exit Antig. &amp;c. Leo. Thou wentst along the journy, how canst thou tell? Host. I did, but I am sure 'tis so: had I staid behind, I thinke this had not proved. Leo. A wench the reason? Lev. Who's that talks of a wench there? Leo. All this discontent About a wench. Lieu. Where is this wench, good Colonell? Leo. Prethee hold thy peace: who cals thee to counsell? Lieu. Why, if there be a wenchâ Leo. 'Tis fit thou know her: Enter 2 Gen. That I'le say for thee, and as fit thou art for her, Let her be mewed or stopt: how is it Gentlemen? 1. G. Hee's wondrous discontent, hee'l speak to no man. 2. G. Has taken his chamber close, admits no entrance; Teares in his eyes, and crying out. Host. 'Tis so sir, And now I wish my selfe half hang'd ere I went this journey. Leo. What is this woman? Lieu. I. Host. I cannot tell ye, But hansome as heaven. Lieu. She is not so high I hope sir. Leo. Where is she? Lieu. I, that would be knowne. Leo. Why sirrah. Host. I cannot show ye neither; The King has now dispos'd of her. Leo. There lyes the matter: Will he admit none to come to comfort him? 1. Gen. Not any neare, nor let 'em knock their hearts out, Will never speake. Lieu. 'Tis the best way if he have her; For look you, a man would be loath to be disturb'd in's pastime; 'Tis every good mans case. Leo. 'Tis all thy living, We must not suffer this, we dare not suffer it: For when these tender soules meet deep afflictions, They are not strong enough to struggle with 'em, But drop away as snow does, from a mountaine, And in the torrent of their owne sighs sinke themselves: I will, and must speake to him. Lieu. So must I too: He promised me a charge. Leo. Of what? of children Upon my conscience, thou hast a double companie, And all of thine owne begetting alreadie. Lieu. Thats all one, I'le raise 'em to a Regiment, and there command 'em, When they turne disobedient, unbeget 'em: Knock 'em o'th' head, and put in new. Leo. A rare way; But for all this, thou art not valiant enough To dare to see the Prince now? Lieu. Do ye thinke he's angry? 1 Gent. Extreamely vext. 2 Gen. To the endangering of any man comes neare him. 1 Gent. Yet, if thou couldst but win him out, VVhat ere thy suite were. Beleeve it granted presently. Leo. Yet thou must thinke though, That in the doing he may breake upon ye, Andâ Lieu. If he do not kill me. Leo. There's the question. Lieu. For halfe a dozen hurts? Leo. Art thou so valiant? Lieu. Not absolutely so neither: no it cannot be, I want my impostumes, and my things about me, Yet I'le make danger, Collonel. Leo. 'Twill be rare sport, How ere it take; give me thy hand; if thou dost this, I'le raise thee up a horse troope, take my word for't. Lieu. What may be done by humane man? Leo. Lets goe then. 1. Gen. Away before the coole: he wil revenge els. Ex. ScÃ¦ne 3. Enter Antigonus, Menippus, and Leucippe. Ant. Will she not yeeld? Leu. For all we can urge to her; I swore I would marry her, she laugh'd extremely, And then she rail'd like thunder. Ant. Call in the Magitian. Enter Mag. with a bowle. I must, and will obtaine her, I am ashes else. Mag. Are all the Philters in? charmes, powders, roots? They are all in: and now I onely stay The invocation of some helping spirits. Ant.

Be sure you make it powerfull enough. Mag. Pray doubt not.â He Conjures. A Song. Rise from the shades below, All you that prove The helpes of loose Love; Rise and bestow Upon this Cup, what ever may compell By powerfull Charme, and un-resisted Spell. A heart un-warm'd to melt in Loves desires, Distill into this Liquor all your fires; Heats, longings, teares, But keepe back frozen feares, That she may know, that has all power defied, Art is a power that will not be denied. The Answer. I obey, I obey, And am come to view e're day Brought along, all may compell, All the earth has, and one hell: Here's a little little Flower, This will make her sweat an houre, Then unto such flames arise, A thousand joyes will not suffice. Here's the powder of the Moone With which she caught Endymion, The powerfull teares that Venus cryed, When the Boy Adonis dyed. Here's Medeas Charme, with which Jasons heart she did bewitch, Omphale this Spell put in When she made the Libian spin. This dull root pluckt from Lethe flood, Purges all pure thoughts, and good. These I stir thus, round, round, round, Whilst our light feet beat the ground. Mag. Now sir 'tis full, and whosoever drinkes this Shall violently doat upon your person, And never sleepe nor eate unsatisfied: So many houres 'twill worke, and worke with violence, And those expired 'tis done.

Be sure you give her this, and see her drinke it; Delay no time when she calls next. Leu. I shall sir. Ant. Let none else touch it on your life. Leu. I am charged sir. Ant.

Are there no Guns i'th' doore? The rogue will doe it, And yet I know he has no stomack to't. Lieut. What loope-holes are there when I knock for stones, For those may pepper me? I can perceeive none.

Now Colonel, if I liveâ Leo. The Troop's thine own Boy. Enter Dem. a pistol. Dem. What desperate foole, ambitious of his ruine? Lieut. Your father would desire ye, sir, to come to dinner. Dem. Thou art no more, Lieut. Now, now, now, now. Dem. Poore coxcomb, Why doe I aime at thee? Exit. Leo. His feare has kill'd him. En. Leuc. with a bowl. 2 Gent. I protest hee's almost stiffe: bend him, and rub him: Hold his nose close, you, if you be a woman, Helpe us a little: here's a man neere perish't. Leu. Alas, alas, I have nothing here about me. Looke to my bowle: Ile run in presently And fetch some waters: bend him, and set him upwards. Leo. A goodly manâ Exit. Here's brave heart: he's warme againe: you shall not 2 Gent. Leave us i'th'lurch so, sirrah. Now he breathes too. Leo. If we had but any drinke to rayse his spirits. What's that i'th' bowle? upon my life good Liquor, She would not owne it else. 1. Gen. He sees. Leo. Looke up boy, And take this cup, and drinke it off, I'le pledge thee, Guide it to his mouth: he swallowes heartily. 2. Gen. Oh! feare and sorrowes dry; 'tis offâ Leo. Stand up man. Lieu. Am I not shot? Leo. Away with him, and cheere him: Thou hast won thy Troop. Lieu. I thinke I won it bravely. Leo. Goe, I must see the Prince, he must not live thus; And let me heare an houre hence from ye. Well sirâ Ex. Gen. and Lieu. Enter Leucippe with water. Leu. Here, here: where's the sicke Gentleman? Leo. Hee's up and gone, Lady. Leu. Alas: that I came so late. Leo. He must still thanke ye, Ye left that in a cup here did him comfort. Leu. That in the bowle? Leo. Yes truly, very much comfort, He dranke it off, and after it spoke lustily. Leu. Did he drinke it all? Leo. All off. Leu. The devill choke him, I am undone: 'has twenty devils in him, Undone for ever: left he none? Leo. I thinke not. Leu. No not a drop: what shall become of me now? Had he no where else to swound? a veng'ance swound him: Undone, undone, undone: stay, I can lye yet, And sweare too at a pinch, thats all my comfort, Ent. De. Look to him; I say look to him, &amp; but mark what folows. Ex Leo. What a devill ayles the woman? here comes the Prince again, With such a sadnes on his face, as sorrow, Sorrow her self, but poorely imitates. Sorrow of sorrowes on that heart that caus'd it. De. Why might she not be false &amp; treacherous to me? And found so by my father? she was a woman, And many a one of that sexe, young and faire, As full of faith as she have fallen, and fouly. Leo. It is a wench: O that I knew the circumstance. Dem. Why might not, to preserve me from this ruine, She having lost her honor, and abused me, My father change the formes o'th' coines, and execute His anger on a fault she ne're committed, Only to keep me safe? why should I thinke so? She never was to me but all obedience, Sweetnes, and love. Leo. How heartily he weeps now? I have not wept these thirty yeares and upward; But now, if I should be hang'd I cannot hold from't; It grieves me to the heart. Dem. Who's that that mocks me? Leo. A plague of him that mocks ye: I grieve truly, Truly and heartily to see you thus sir: And if it lay in my power, Gods are my witnesse, Who ere he be, that tooke your sweet peace from ye; I am not so old yet, nor want I spiritâ Dem. No more of that no more Leontius, Revenges are the gods: our part is sufferance: Farewell, I shall not see thee long. Leo. Good sir, tell me the cause, I know there is a woman in't; Doe you hold me faithfull? dare ye trust your souldier? Sweet Prince, the cause? Dem. I must not, dare not tell it, And as thou art an honest man, enquire not. Leo. Will ye be merry then? Dem. I am wondrous merry. Leo. 'Tis wondrous well: you think now this becomes ye. Shame on't, it does not sir, it shewes not hansomely; If I were thus, you would sweare I were an asse straight; A wooden asse; whine for a wench? Dem. Prethee leave me. Leo. I will not leave ye for a fit. Dem. Leontius? Leo. For that you may have any where for sixepence, And a deare penny worth too. Dem. Nay, then you are troublesome. Leo. Not halfe so troublesome as you are to your self sir; Was that brave heart made to pant for a placket: And now i'th' dog-daies too, when nothing dare love? That noble mind to melt away, and moulder For a hay-nonny-nonny? would I had a glasse here, To shew ye what a pretty toy ye are turn'd to. Dem. My wretched fortune. Leo. Will ye but let me know her? I'le once turne bawd: go too, they are good mens offices, And not so contemptible as we take 'em for: And if she be above ground, and a woman, I aske no more; I'le bring her o' my backe sir, By this hand I will: and I had as lieve bring the devill, I care not who she be, nor where I have her, And in your armes, or the next bed deliver her, Which you thinke fittest: and when you have danc'd your galliard. Dem. Away, and foole to them are so affected: O thou art gone, and all my comfort with thee; Wilt thou do one thing for me? Leo. All things i'th' world sir, Of all dangers. Dem. Sweare. Leo. I will. Dem. Come neere me no more then. Leo. How? Dem. Come no more neere me: Thou art a plague-sore to me. Exit. Leo. Give you good ev'n sir; If you be suffer'd thus, we shall have fine sport. I will be sorry yet. Ent. 2 Gent. 1 Gent. How now, how does he? Leo. Nay, if I tell ye hang me, or any man else That hath his nineteen wits; he has the bots I thinke, He groanes, and roares, and kicks. 2 Gent. Will he speake yet? Leo. Not willingly: Shortly he will not see a man; if ever I look'd upon a Prince so metamorphis'd, So juggled into I know not what, shame take me; This 'tis to be in love. 1 Gent. Is that the cause on't? Leo. What is it not the cause of but beare baitings? And yet it stinkes much like it: out upon't, What Giants, and what dwarffs, what owles and apes, What dogs, and cats it makes us? men that are possest with it, Live as if they had a legion of devils in 'em, And every devill of a severall nature, Nothing but Hey passe, re-passe: where's the Lieutenant? Has he gathered up the end on's wits againe? 1 Gent. He is alive: but you that talke of wonders, Shew me but such a wonder as he is now. Leo. Why? he was ever at the worst a wonder. 2 Gent. He is now most wonderfull; a blazer now sir: Leo. What ailes the fooles? and what star raignes now gentlemen We have such prodigies? 2 Gen. 'T will poaze your heaven-hunters; He talks now of the King no other language, And with the King, as he imagines hourely, Courts the King, drinks to the King, dies for the King, Buyes all the pictures of the King, wears the Kings colors, Leo. Does he not lye i'th' Kings street too? 1. Gen. Hee's going thither, Makes praiers for the King in sundry languages, Turnes all his Proclamations into meeter, Is really in love with the King, most doatingly, And sweares Adonis was a devill to him: A sweet King, a most comely King, and such a Kingâ 2. Gen. Then down on's mary-bones: O excellent King: Thus he begins, Thou light and life of creatures, Angell-ey'd King, vouchsafe at length thy favour; And so proceeds to incision: what think ye of this sorrow? 1. Gen. Will as familiarly kisse the Kings horses As they passe by him: ready to ravish his footmen. Leo. Why this is above Ela? But how comes this? 1. Gen. Nay thats to understand yet, But thus it is, and this part but the poorest, 'Twould make a man leap over the Moone to see him act these. 2. Gen. With sighes as though his heart would breake: Cry like a breech'd boy, not eat a bit. Leo. I must goe see him presently, For this is such a gig: for certaine Gentlemen The Fiend rides on a Fiddlesticke. 2. Gen. I thinke so. Leo. Can ye guide me to him? for half an houre I am his, To see the miracle. 1. Gen. We sure shall start him. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 5. Enter Antigonus and Leucippe. Ant. Are you sure she dranke it? Leu. Now must I lye most confidently. Yes sir, she has drunke it off. Ant. How works it with her? Leu. I see no alteration yet. Ant. There will be, For he is the greatest Artist living made it; Where is she now? Leu. She is ready to walke out sir. Ant. Starke mad, I know she will be. Leu. So I hope sir. Ant. She knowes not of the Prince? Leu. Of no man livingâ Ant. How do I looke? how do my clothes become me? I am not very gray. Leu. A very youth sir, Upon my maiden-head as smug as April: Heaven blesse that sweet face, 'twill undoe a thousand, Many a soft heart must sob yet, ere that wither, Your Grace can give content enough. Ant. I thinke so. Enter Celia with a book Leu. Here she comes sir. Ant. How shall I keep her off me? Go &amp; perfume the room: make all things ready. Ex. Len. Cel. No hope yet of the Prince? no comfort of him? They keep me mew'd up here, as they mew mad folkes, No companie but my afflictions. This royall devill againe? strange, how he haunts me? How like a poison'd potion his eyes fright me? Has made himselfe hansome too. Ant. Doe you looke now, Lady? You will leap anon. Cel. Curl'd and perfum'd? I smell him: He looks on's leggs too: sure he will cut a caper, God-a-mercie deare December. Ant. O doe you smile now: I knew it would worke with you: come hither pretty one. Cel. Sir. Ant. I like those curtesies well come hither &amp; kisse me. Cel. I am reading sir of a short Treatise here, Thats call'd the vanitie of lust: has your Grace seene it? He sayes here, that an old mans loose desire Is like the glow-wormes light, the Apes so wonder'd at: Which when they gather'd sticks, and laid upon't, And blew, and blew, turn'd taile, and went out presently: And in another place, he cals their loves, Faint smels of dying flowers, carry no comforts; They'r doating stinking foggs, so thick and muddy, Reason with all his beames cannot beat through 'em. Ant. How's this? is this the potion? you but foole still, I know you love me. Cel. As ye are just and honest, I know I love and honour ye: admire ye. Ant. This makes against me, fearfully against me. Cel. But as you bring your power to persecute me, Your traps to catch mine innoncence, to rob me, As you lay out your lusts to overwhelme me, Hell never hated good, as I hate you sir; And I dare tell it to your face: What glory Now after all your Conquests got, your Titles, The ever-living memories rais'd to you. Can my defeat be? my poore wracke, what triumph? And when you crowne your swelling cups to fortune, What honourable tongue can sing my story? Be as your Embleme is, a glorious Lamp Set on the top of all, to light all perfectly: Be as your office is, a god like Justice, Into all shedding equally your vertues. Ant. She has drencht me now: now I admire hir goodnes; So young, so nobly strong, I never tasted: Can nothing in the powers of Kings perswade ye? Cel. No, nor that power command me. Ant. Say I should force ye? I have it in my will. Cel. Your will's a poore one; And though it be a Kings will, a despised one, Weaker then Infants leggs, your will's in swadling clouts: A thousand waies my will has found to checke ye; A thousand doores to leape ye I dare die sir As suddenly I dare die, as you can offer: Nay say you had your will, say you had ravish'd me, Perform'd your lust, what had you purchas'd by it? What honor won, doe you know who dwels above sir, And what they have prepared for men turr'd devils? Did you never heare their thunder? start and tremble, Death sitting on your bloud, when their fires visit us? Will nothing wring you then do you thinke? sit hard here? And like a snaile curle round about your conscience Biting and stinging: will you not roare too late then? Then when you shake in horror of this villanie, Then will I rise a star in heaven, and scorne ye. Ant. Lust, how I hate thee now? and love this sweetnesse? Will ye be my Queene? can that price purchase ye? Cel. Not all the world, I am a Queene alreadie, Crown'd by his love, I must not lose for fortune; I can give none away, sell none away sir, Can lend no love, am not mine owne Exchequer; For in anothers heart my hope and peace lyes. Ant. Your faire hands, Lady: for yet I am not pure enough To touch these lips, in that sweet peace ye spoke of: Live now for ever, and I to serve your vertuesâ Cel. Why now ye show a god? now I kneele to ye; This sacrifice of Virgins joy send to ye: Thus I hold up my hands to heaven that touch'd ye, And pray eternall blessings dwell about ye. Ant. Vertue commands the stars: rise more then vertue; Your present comfort shall be now my busines. Cel. All my obedient service wait upon ye. Ex. severally. ScÃ¦ne 6. Enter Leontius, Gentlemen, Lieutenant. Leo. Hast thou cleane forgot the wars? Lieu. Prethee hold thy peace. 1. Gen. His mind's much elevated now. Leo. It serves so Sirrah. Lieu. I am so troubled with this fellow. Leo. He will call me rogue anon. 1. Gen. Tis ten to one else. Lie. O King that thou knew'st I loved thee, how I lov'd thee: And where O King I barrell up thy beauty. Leo. He cannot leave his Sutlers trade, he wooes in't. Lieu. O never King. Leo. By this hand, when I considerâ Lieu. My honest friend, you are a little sawcy. 1. Gen. I told you you would have it. Lieu. When mine owne worthâ Leo. Is flung into the ballance, and found nothing. Lieu. And yet a souldier. Leo. And yet a sawcy one. Lieu. One that has followed thee. Leo. Faire and far off. Lieu. Fought for thy grace. Leo. 'Twas for some griefe, you lye Sir. Lieu. Hee's the son of a whore denies this: will that satisfie ye? Leo. Yes, very well. Lieu. Shall then that thing that honors thee? How miserable a thing soever, yet a thing still; And though a thing of nothing, thy thing ever. Leo. Heere's a new thing. 2. Gen. Hee's in a deep dump now. Le. I'le fetch him out on't. When's the Kings birth-day Lieu. When ere it be, that day I'le dye with ringing, And there's the resolution of a Lover. Exit. Leo. A goodly resolution sure I take it, He is bewitch'd, or moop'd, or his braines melted, Could he find no body to fall in love with; but the King, The good old King, to doat upon him too? Stay, now I remember what the fat woman warn'd me, Bad me remember and look to him too: Ile hang if she have not a hand in this: hee's conjured, Goe after him, I pitty the poore rascall, In the meane time Ile wait occasion To worke upon the Prince. 2. Gen. Pray doe that seriously. Ex. severally. ScÃ¦ne 7. Enter Antigonus, Menippus, Lords. Lor. Hee's very ill. Ant. I am very sorry for't, And much ashamed I have wronged his innocence, Menippus, guide her to the Princes lodgings, There leave her to his love againe. Men. I am glad sir. Lord. He will speake to none. Ant. O I shall breake that silence; Be quicke take faire attendance. Men. Yes sir presently. Ex. Ant. He will find his tongue, I warrant ye; his health too; I send a phisick will not faile. Lord. Faire worke it. Ant. We heare the Princes meane to visit us In way of truce. Lord. Tis thought so. Ant. Come: lets in then, And think upon the noblest wayes to meet 'em. Ex. ScÃ¦ne 8. Enter Leontius. Leo. There's no way now to get in: all the lights stopt too; Nor can I heare a sound of him: pray heaven He use no violence: I thinke he has more soule Stronger, and I hope nobler: would I could but see once This beauty he groanes under, or come to know But any circumstance. What noise is that there? I thinke I heard him groane: here are some comming; A woman too, Ile stand aloof, and view 'em. Enter Menippus, Celia, Lords. Cel. Well, some of ye have been too blame in this point, But I forgive ye: The King might have pickt out too Some fitter woman to have tride his valour. Men. Twas all to the best meant, Lady. Cel. I must thinke so, For how to mend it now: hee's here you tell me? Men. Hee's Madam, and the joy to see you only Will draw him out. Leo. I know that womans tongue, I thinke I have seene her face too: Ile goe nearer: If this be she, he has some cause of sorrow: 'Tis the same face; the same, most excellent woman. Cel. This should be Lord Leontius: I remember him. Leo. Lady, I thinke ye know me. Cel. Speake soft, good souldier: I do, and know ye worthy, know ye noble: Know not me yet openly, as you love me; But let me see ye againe, Ile satisfie ye: I am wondrous glad to see those eyes. Leo. You have charged me. Cel. You shall know where I am. Leo. I will not off yet: She goes to knocke at's doore: This must be she The fellow told me of: right glad I am on't, He will bolt now for certaine. Cel. Are ye within sir? Ile trouble you no more: I thanke your curtesie, Pray leave me now. All., Me. We rest your humble servants. Ex. Men. &amp;c. Cel. So now my gyves are off: pray heaven he be here! Master, my royall sir: doe you heare who cals ye? Love my Demetrius. Leo. These are pretty quaile-pipes, The Corke will come anon. Cel. Can ye be drowsie, When I call at your window? Leo. I heare him stirring: Enter Demetrius. Now he comes wondring out. Dem. Tis Celias sound sure: The sweetnesse of that tongue drawes all hearts to it; There stands the shape too. Leu. How he stares upon her? Dem. Ha? do mine eyes abuse me? 'Tis she, the living Celia: your hand Lady? Cel. What should this meane? Dem. The very selfesame Celia. Cel. How do ye sir? Dem. Only turn'd brave. I heard you were dead my deare on: compleat, She is wondrous brave, a wondrous gallant Courtier. Cel. How he surveies me round? here has been foule play. Dem. How came she thus? Cel. It was a kind of death sir, I suffered in your absence, meu'd up here, And kept conceal'd I know not how. Dem. 'Tis likely: How came you hether Celia? wondrous gallant: Did my father send for ye? Cel. So they told me Sir, And one command too. Dem. I hope you were obedient? Cel. I was so ever. Dem. And ye were bravely us'd? Cel. I wanted nothing: My maiden-head to a mote i'th' Sun, he's jealous: I must now play the knave with him, to dye for't, 'Tis in me nature. Dem. Her very eyes are alter'd: Jewels, and rich ones too, I never saw yetâ And what were those came for ye? Cel. Monstrous jealous: Have I liv'd at the rate of these scorn'd questions? They seemed of good sort Gentlemen. Dem. Kind men? Cel. They were wondrous kind: I was much beholding to 'em; There was one Menippus sir. Dem. Ha? Cel. One Menippus, A notable merry Lord, and a good companion. Dem. And one Charinthus too? Cel. Yes, there was such a one. Dem. And Timon? Cel. 'Tis most true. Dem. And thou most treacherous: My fathers bawdes byâthey never misse course; And were these daily with ye? Cel. Every houre sir. Dem. And was there not a Lady, a fat Lady? Cel. O Yes; a notable good wench: Dem. The devill fetch her. Cel. 'Tis ev'n the merriest wenchâ Dem. Did she keepe with ye too? Cel. She was all in all; my bedfellow, eate with me, Brought me acquainted. Dem. You are well knowne here then? Cel. There is no living here a stranger I thinke. Dem. How came ye by this brave gowne? Cel. This is a poore one: Alas, I have twenty richer: do you see these jewels? Why, they are the poorest things, to those are sent me, And sent me hourely too. Dem. Is there no modestie? No faith in this faire Sexe? Leo. What will this prove too? For yet with all my wits, I understand not. Dem. Come hether; thou art dead indeed, lost, tainted; All that I left thee faire, and innocent, Sweet as thy youth, and carrying comfort in't; All that I hoped for vertuous, is fled from thee, Turn'd backe, and banckrupt. Leo. By'r Lady, this cuts shrewdly. Dem. Thou art dead, for ever dead; sins surfet slew thee; The ambition of those wanton eyes betraid thee; Go from me grave of honor; go thou foule one, Thou glory of thy sin; go thou dispis'd one, And where there is no vertue, nor no virgin; Where Chastitie was never knowne, nor heard of; Where nothing reigns but imperious lust, and losers faces Goe thether, child of bloud, and sing my doating. Cel. You do not speake this seriously I hope sir; I did but jest with you. Dem. Looke not upon me, There is more hell in those eyes, then hell harbours; And when they flame, more torments. Cel. Dare ye trust me? You durst once even with all you had: your love sir? By this faire light I am honest. Dem. Thou subtle Circes, Cast not upon the maiden light eclipses: Curse not the day. Cel. Come, come, you shall not do this: How faine you would seeme angry now, to fright me; You are not in the field among your enemies; Come, I must coole this courage. Dem. Out thou impudence, Thou ulcer of thy Sexe; when I first saw thee, I drew into mine eyes mine owne destruction, I puld into my heart that sudden poyson, That now consumes my deare content to sinders: I am not now Demetrius, thou hast chang'd me; Thou woman with thy thousand wiles hast chang'd me; Thou Serpent with thy angell-eyes hast slaine me; And where, before I touch'd on this faire ruine, I was a man, and reason made, and mov'd me, Now one great lump of griefe. I grow and wander. Cel. And as you are noble, do you thinke I did this? Dem. Put all the devills wings on, and flie from me. Cel. I will go from ye, never more to see ye: I will flie from ye, as a plague hangs o're me; And through the progresse of my life hereafter; Where ever I shall find a foole, a false man, One that ne're knew the worth of pollish'd vertue; A base suspecter of a virgins honour, A child that flings away the wealth he cride for, Him will I call Demetrius: that foole Demetrius, That mad man a Demetrius; and that false man, The Prince of broken faiths, even Prince Demetrius. You thinke now, I should cry, and kneele down to ye, Petition for my peace; let those that feele here The weight of evill, waite for such a favour, I am above your hate, as far above it, In all the actions of an innocent life, As the pure Stars are from the muddy meators: Crye when you know your folly: howle and curse then, Beate that unmanly breast, that holds a false heart When ye shall come to know, whom ye have flung from ye. Dem. Pray ye stay a little. Cel. Not your hopes can alter me, Then let a thousand backe thoughts muster in ye, And with those enter in a thousand doatings; Those eyes be never shut, but drop to nothing: My innocence for ever haunt and fright ye: Those armes together grow in folds; that tongue, That bold bad tongue that barkes out these disgraces. When you shall come to know how nobly vertuous I have preserv'd my life, rot, rot within ye. Dem. What shall I doe? Cel. Live a lost man for ever. Goe aske your fathers conscience what I suffered, And through what seas of hazards I sayl'd through: Mine honour still advanced in spight of tempests, Then take your leave of love; and confesse freely, You were never worthy of this heart that serv'd ye, And so farewell ungratefullâ Exit. Dem. Is she gone? Leo. Ile follow her, and will find out this matter. Exit. Enter Antigonus, and Lords. Antig. Are ye pleas'd now? have you got your heart again? Have I restor'd ye that? Dem. Sir: even for heavens sake, And sacred truth sake, tell me how ye found her. Antig. I will, and in few words. Before I tride her, 'Tis true, I thought her most unfit your fellowship, And fear'd her too: which feare begot that story I told ye first: but since, like gold I toucht her. Dem. And how deare sir? Antig. Heavens holy light's not purer: The constancy and goodnesse of all women That ever liv'd, to win the names of worthy, This noble Maid has doubled in her: honour, All promises of wealth, all art to win her, And by all tongues imploy'd, wrought as much on her As one may doe upon the Sun at noone day By lighting Candles up: her shape is heavenly, And to that heavenly shape her thoughts are angells. Dem. Why did you tell me sir? Antig. 'Tis true, I err'd in't: But since I made a full proofe of her vertue, I find a King too poore a servant for her. Love her, and honour her; in all observe her. She must be something more then time yet tels her: And certaine I beleeve him blest, enjoyes her: I would not lose the hope of such a daughter, To adde another Empire to my honour. Exit. Dem. O wretched state! to what end shall I turn me? And where begins my penance? now, what service Will win her love againe? my death must doe it: And if that sacrifice can purge my follies, Be pleas'd, O mightie Love, I dye thy servant.â Exit.</field>

I know itâ There's no way left: Cel. For heavens sake doe not name him. Doe not thinke on him sir, he's so far from me In all my thoughts now, methinkes I never knew him. Leo. But yet I would see him againe. Cel. No, never, never. Leo. I doe not meane to lend him any comfort; But to afflict him, so to torture him; That even his very soule may shake within him: To make him know, though he be great and powerfull, 'Tis not within his aime to deale dishonourably, And carry it off, and with a maid of your sort. Cel. I most confesse, I could most spightfully afflict him; Now, now, I could whet my anger at him; Now, arm'd with bitternesse, I could shoot through him; I long to vex him: Leo. And doe it home, and bravely: Cel. Were I a man? Leo. Ile helpe that weakenesse in ye: I honour ye, and serve ye. Cel. Not onely to disclaime me, When he had seal'd his vowes in heaven, sworne to me, And poore beleeving I became his servant: But most maliciously to brand my credit, Staine my pure name. Leo. I would not suffer it: See him I would againe, and to his teeth too: Od's precious, I would ring him such a lessonâ Cel. I have done that already. Leo. Nothing, nothing: It was too poore a purge; besides, by this time He has found his fault, and feeles the hells that follow it. That, and your urg'd on anger to the highest. Why, 'twill be such a stroakeâ Cel. Say he repent then, And seeke with teares to soften, I am a woman; A woman that have lov'd him, sir, have honour'd him: I am no more. Leo. Why, you may deale thereafter. Cel. If I forgive him, I am lost. Leo. Hold there then, The sport will be to what a poore submissionâ But keepe you strong. Cel. I would not see him. Leo. Yes, You shall ring his knell: Cel. How if I kill him? Leo. Kill him: why, let him dye. Cel. I know 'tis fit so. But why should I that lov'd him once, destroy him? O had he scap't this sin, what a brave Gentlemanâ Leo. I must confesse, had this not falne, a nobler, A handsomer, the whole world had not show'd ye: And to his making such a mind. Cel.

Nay, I forgive thy wife with all my heart, And am right glad she dranke it not her selfe, And more glad that the vertuous maid escapt it, I would not for the world 'thad hit: but that this Souldier, Lord how he lookes, that he should take this vomit; Can he make rimes too? 2 Gent.

Even as much as a sober man might; &amp; a Souldier That your Grace owes just halfe a yeares pay to. Ant. Well remembred; And did I seeme so young and amiable to ye? Lieu. Methought you were the sweetest youthâ Ant. That's excellent. Lieu. I truly sir; and ever as I thought on ye, I wish'd, and wish'dâ Ant. What didst thou wish I prethee? Lieu. Ev'n, that I had been a wench of fifteene for ye, A hansome wench sir. Ant. Why? God a mercy Souldier: I seeme not so now to thee. Lieu. Not all out: And yet I have a grudging to your Grace still. Ant. Thou wast never in love before? Lieu. Not with a King, And hope I shall never be again: Truly sir, I have had such plundges, and such bickrings, And as it were such runnings atilt within me, For whatsoever it was provok't me toward ye. Ant. God-a-mercy still. Lieu. I had it with a vengeance, It plaid his prize. Ant. I would not have been a wench then, Though of this age. Lieu. No sure, I should have spoiled ye. Ant. Well, goe thy waies, of all the lusty lovers That ere I sawâwilt have an other potion? Lieu. If you will be another thing, have at ye. Ant. Ha, ha, ha: give me thy hand, from henceforth thou art my souldier, Do bravely, Ile love thee as much. Lieu. I thanke ye; But if you were mine enemie, I would not wish it ye: I beseech your Grace, pay me my charge. 2 Gen. Thats certaine sir; Has bought up all that ere he found was like ye, Or any thing you have lov'd, that he could purchase; Old horses, that your Grace has ridden blind, &amp; founder'd; Dogs, rosten hawkes, and which is more then all this, Has worne your Graces Gauntlet in his Bonnet. An. Bring in your Bils: mine own love shall be satisfi'd; And sirrah, for this potion you have taken, Ile point ye out a portion ye shall live on. Men, Twas the best draught that ere ye drunk. Lieu. I hope so. Ant. Are the Princes come to'th' Court? Men. They are all, and lodg'd sir. Ant. Come then, make ready for their entertainment, Which presently wee'l give: wait you on me sir. Lie. I shal love drinke the better whilst I live boyes. Ex. ScÃ¦ne 3. Enter Demetrius and Leontius. Dem. Let me but see her deare Leontius; Let me but dye before her. Leo. Would that would doe it: If I knew where she lay now, with what honestie, You having flung so maine a mischiefe on her, And on so innocent and sweet a Beautie, Dare I present your visit? Dem. Ile repent all: And with the greatest sacrifice of sorrow That ever Lover made. Leo. Twill be too late sir: I know not what will become of you. Dem. You can help me. Le. It may be to her sight: what are you nearer; She has sworne she will not speake to ye looke upon ye, And to love ye againe, O she cries out, and thunders, She had rather loveâthere is no hopeâ Dem. Yes Leontius, There is a hope, which though it draw no love to it, At least will draw her to lament my fortune, And that hope shall relieve me. Leo. Harke ye sir, harke ye: Say I should bring yeâ Dem. Do not trifle with me? Leo. I will not trifle; both together bring ye, You know the wrongs ye' done. Dem. I do confesse 'em. Leo. And if you should then jump into your fury, And have another querke in your head. Dem. I'le dye first. Leo. You must say nothing to her; for 'tis certaine, The nature of your crime will admit no excuse. Dem. I will not speake, mine eyes shall tell my penance. Leo. You must looke wondrous sad too. Dem. I need not looke so, I am truly sadnesse selfe. Leo. That looke will do it: Stay here, I'le bring her to you instantly: But take heed how you beare your selfe: sit down there, The more humble you are, the more she'l take compassion Women are per'lous things to deale upon. Exit. Dem. What shall become of me? to curse my fortune, Were but to curse my father; that's too impious; But under whatsoever fate I suffer, Blesse I beseech thee heaven her harmlesse goodnesse. Enter Leontius and Celia. Leo. Now arme your selfe. Cel. You have not brought him? Leo. Yes faith, And there he is: you see in what poore plight too, Now you may doe your will, kill him, or save him. Cel. I will goe back. Leo. I will be hang'd then Lady, Are yee a coward now? Cel. I cannot speak to him. Dem. O me. Leo. There was a sigh to blow a Church downe; So, now their eyes are fixt, the small shot playes, They will come toth' batterie anon. Cel. He weeps extreamly. Leo. Raile at him now. Cel. I dare not. Leo. I am glad on't. Cel. Nor dare beleeve his teares. Dem. You may blest beauty, For those thicke streames that troubled my repentance, Are crept out long agoe. Leo. You see how he looks. Cel. What have I to doe how he looks? how lookt he then, When with a poisoned truth he bit mine honour, It was your counsell too, to scorne and slight him. Leo. I, if ye saw fit cause; and you confest too, Except this sin, he was the bravest gentleman, The sweetest, noblest: I take nothing from ye, Nor from your anger; use him as you please: For to say truth, he has deserved your justice; But still consider what he has been to you. Cel. Pray doe not blinde me thus. Dem. O gentle Mistris, If there were any way to expiate A sinne so great as mine, by intercession, By praiers, by daily teares, by dying for ye: O what a joy would close these eyes that love ye. Leo. They say women have tender hearts, I know not, I am sure mine melts. Cel. Sir, I forgive ye heartily, And all your wrong to me I cast behind me, And wish ye a fit beauty to your vertues: Mine is too poore, in peace I part thus from you; I must look back: gods keep your Grace: he's here still. Ex. Dem. She has forgiven me. Leo. She has directed ye: Up, up, and follow like a man: away sir, She lookt behind her twice: her heart dwels here sir, Ye drew teares from her too: she cannot freeze thus; The doore's set open too, are ye a man? Are ye alive? doe ye understand her meaning? Have ye bloud and spirit in ye? Dem. I dare not trouble her. Leo. Nay, and you will be nipt i'th' head with nothing, Walke whining up and downe; I dare not, I cannot: Strike now or never: faint heart, you know what sirâ Be govern'd by your feare, and quench your fire out. A devill on't stands this doore ope for nothing: So get ye together, and be naught: now to secure all, Will I go fetch out a more soveraigne plaister. Ex. ScÃ¦ne 4. Enter Antigonus, Seleucus, Lysimachus, Ptolomey, Lieuten. Gent. Lords. Ant. This peace is fairely made. Seleu. Would your Grace wish us To put in more: take what you please, we yeeld it; The honour done us by your sonne constraines it, Your noble sonne. Ant. It is sufficient, Princes; And now we are one againe, one mind, one body, And one sword shall strike for us. Lys. Let Prince Demetrius But lead us on: for we are his vowed servants; Against the strength of all the world wee'l buckle. Ptol. And even from all that strength wee'l catch at victory. Sel. O had I now recover'd but the fortune I lost in Antioch, when mine Unckle perish'd; But that were but to surfeit me with blessings. Lys. You lost a sweet childe there. Sel. Name it no more sir; This is no time to entertaine such sorrowes; Wil your Majestie do us the honor, we may see the Prince, And wait upon him? Enter Leon. Ant. I wonder he stayes from us: How now Leontius, where's my sonne? Sel. Brave Captaine. Lys. Old valiant sir. Leo. Your Graces are welcome: Your sonne and't please you sir, is new casheered yonder, Cast from his Mistris favour: and such a coile there is; Such fending, and such proving; she stands off, And will by no meanes yeeld to composition: He offers any price; his body to her. Sel. She is a hard Lady, denies that caution. Leo. And now they whine, &amp; now they rave: faith Princes, 'Twere a good point of charitie to piece 'em; For lesse then such a power will doe just nothing: And if you meane to see him, there it must be, For there will he grow, till he be transplanted. Sel. Beseech your Grace, lets wait upon you thither, That I may see that beauty dares deny him, That scornfull beautie. Ptol. I should thinke it worse now; Ill brought up beautie. Ant. She has too much reason for't; Which with too great a grief, I shame to thinke of, But wee'l goe see this game. Lys. Rather this wonder. Ant. Be you our guide Leontius, here's a new peace. Ex. ScÃ¦ne 5. Enter Demetrius and Celia. Cel. Thus far you shall perswade me still to honour ye, Still to live with ye sir, or neere about ye; For not to lye, you have my first and last love, But since you have conceiv'd an evill against me, An evill that so much concernes your honour, That honour aim'd by all at for a patterne: And though there be a false thought, and confest too, And much repentance falne in shoures to purge it; Yet, whilst that great respect I ever bore ye, Dwels in my bloud, and in my heart that duty; Had it but been a dreame, I must not touch ye. Dem. O you will make some other happy? Cel. Never, Upon this Hand I'le seale that faith. Dem. We may kisse, Put not those out o'th' peace too. Cel. Those I'le give ye, So there you will be pleas'd to pitch your ultra, I will be merry with ye; sing, discourse with ye, Be your poore Mistris still: in truth I love ye. Enter Leontius, Antigonus, Seleucus, Lysimachus, Ptolomy, Lieutenant, Gentleman. Dem. Stay, who are these? Lys. A very hansome Lady? Leo. As ere you saw. Sel. Pitty her heart's so cruell. Lys. How does your Grace? he stands still, will not heare us. Ptol. We come to serve ye sir, in all our fortunes. Lys. He bowes a little now; he's strangely alter'd. Sel. Ha? pray ye a word Leontius, pray ye a word with ye Lysimachus? you both knew mine Enanthe, I lost in Antioch, when the Towne was taken, Mine unckle slaine, Antigonus had the sack on't? Lys. Yes, I remember well the girle. Sel. Methinkes now That face is wondrous like her: I have her Picture, The same, but more yeares on her; the very same. Lys. A cherry to a cherry is not liker. Sel. Looke on her eyes. Leo. Most certaine she is like her: Many a time have I dandled her in these armes sir, And I hope who will more. Ant. What's that ye looke at, Princes? Sel. This picture, and that Lady sir. Ant. Ha: they are neare: They only erre in time. Lys. Did you marke that blush there? That came the nearest. Sel. I must speake to her. Leo. You'l quickly be resolved. Sel. Your name sweet Lady? Cel. Enanthe, sir: and this to beg your blessing. Sel. Doe you know me? Cel. If you be the King Seleucus, I know you are my father. Sel. Peace a little, Where did I lose ye? Cel. At the sack of Antioch, Where my good Unckle di'de, and I was taken, By a meane souldier taken: by this Prince, This noble Prince, redeemed from him againe, Where ever since I have remained his servant. Sel. My joyes are now too full: welcome Enanthe, Mine owne, my dearest, and my best Enanthe. Dem. And mine too desperate. Cel. You shall not thinke so, This is a peace indeed. Ant. I hope it shall be, And aske it first. Cel. Most royall sir, ye have it. Dem. I once more beg it thus. Sel. You must not be deni'd sir. Cel. By me, I am sure he must not: sure he shall not; Kneeling I give it too; kneeling I take it; And from this houre, no envious spight ere part us. All. The gods give happy joyes; all comforts to ye. Dem. My new Enanthe. Ant. Come, beat all the Drums up, And all the noble instruments of war: Let 'em fill all the Kingdome with their sounds; And those the brazen arch of heaven breake through, While to the Temple we conduct these two. Leo. May they be ever loving, ever young, And ever worthy of those lines they sprong: May their faire issues walke with time along. Lieu. And hang a coward now; and there's my song. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. VVould some man would instruct me what to say: For this same Prologue, usuall to a play, Is tied to such an old forme of Petition; Men must say nothing now beyond commission: The cloakes we weare, the leggs we make, the place We stand in, must be one; and one the face. Nor alter'd, nor exceeded; if it be, A generall hisse, hangs on our levitie: We have a Play, a new Play to play now, And thus low in our Plaies behalfe we bow; We bow to beg your suffrage, and kind eare; If it were naught, or that it might appeare A thing boy'd up by prayer, Gentlemen, Beleeve my faith, you should not see me then. Let them speake then have power to stop a storme, I never lov'd to feele a house so warme: But for the Play, if you dare credit me, I thinke it well: All new things you shall see, And those dispos'd to all the mirth that may; And short enough we hope: and such a Play You were wont to like: sit nobly then, and see: If it miscarrie, pray looke not for me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. I am not cur'd yet throughlie; for beleeve I feele another passion that may grieve All over me I feele it too: and now It takes me cold, cold, cold, I know not how: As you are good men helpe me, a Carowse May make me love you all, all here i'th' house, And all that comes to see me doatingly: Now lend your hands; and for your curtesie, The next imployment I am sent upon, I'le sweare you are Phisitians, the wars none. FINIS.</field>
