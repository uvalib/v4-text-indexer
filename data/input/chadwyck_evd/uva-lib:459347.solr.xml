[Bard.] whether I please, thou art my prize and I pleade purchase of thee [Doll.] Purchase of me? away ye Rascall, I am an honest plaine Carpenters wife and thoughe I haue no beautie to like a husband yet what soeuer is mine scor nes to stoupe to a straunger: hand off then when I bid thee. [Bard.] Goe with me quietly, or Ile compell thee. [Doll.] Compell me ye dogges face? thou thinkst thou hast the Goldsmithes «wife in hand, whom thou enticedst from her husband with all his plate, and «when thou turndst her home to him againe, madste him (like an Asse) pay for «his wifes boorde. Bard. So will I make thy husband too, if please me Enter Caueler with a paire of dooues, Williamson the Carpenter and Sherwin following him. [Doll.] Heere he comes him selfe, tell him so if thou darste. Caue. ffollowe me no further, I say thou shalt not haue them. Wil. I bought them in Cheapeside, and paide my monie for them. Sher. He did Sir indeed, and you offer him wrong, bothe to take them from him, and not restore him his monie neither. Caue. If he paid for them, let it suffise that I possesse them, Beefe and brewes may serue such hindes, are Piggions meate for a coorse Carpenter? Lin. [It is hard when Englishmens pacience must be thus ietted on by straungers] [and they not dare to reuendge their owne wrongs.] Geo. Lincolne, lets beate them downe, and beare no more of these abuses. Lin. we may not Betts, be pacient and heare more. Doll [How now husband? what, one straunger take thy food from thee, and another] [thy wife? bir Lady flesh and blood I thinke can hardly brooke that.] Lin. [will this geere neuer be otherwise? must these wrongs be thus endured?] Geo. [let vs step in, and help to reuendge their iniurie.] Bard. what art thou that talkest of reuendge? my Lord Ambassadour shall once more make your Maior haue a check, if he punishe thee not for this saucie presumption« Wil. Indeed my Lord Maior, on the Ambassadours complainte, sent me to Newgate «one day, because (against my will) I tooke the wall of a straunger. you may doo a«ny thing, the Goldsmi«th's wife», and mine now must «b»e at your c?maundment. Geo. [The more pacient fooles are ye bothe to suffer it.] Bard. [Suffer it? mend it thou or he if ye can or dare, I tell thee fellowe, and she were«] [the Maior of Londons wife, had I her once in my possession, I would keep her in sp«ite] [of him that durst say nay.] Geo. I tell thee Lombard, these wordes should cost thy best cappe, were I not cur«bd by dutie and obedience. The Maior of Londons wife? Oh God, shall it be thus? Doll. why Bettes, am not I as deare to my husband, as my Lord Maiors wife to him, a«nd wilt [he]/[thou] so neglectly suffer [his]/[thine] owne shame? Hands off proude stranger «or [him that bought me, if mens milkie harts «d»are not strike a straunger, yet «wo] [men will beate them downe, ere they beare these abuses.] Bard. [Mistresse, I say you shall along with me.] Doll. to Caueler. [Touche not Doll Williamson, least she lay thee along on Gods deare earthe. An«d] [you Sir, that allow such coorse cates to Carpenters, whilste Pidgions which they] [pay for, must serue your daintie appetite: deliuer them back to my husband aga«in] [or Ile call so many women to myne assistance, as weele not leaue one inche vntorne] [of thee. If our husbands must be brideled by lawe, and forced to beare your] [wrongs, their wiues will be a little lawelesse, and soundly beate ye.] Caue. [Come away de Bard, and let vs goe complaine to my Lord Ambassadour] —ex. Ambo Doll. [I, goe, and send him among vs, and weele giue him his welcome too. I am as«hamed] [that free borne Englishmen, hauing beatten straungers within their owne boun [should thus be brau'de and abusde by them at home.] Sher. [It is not our lack of courage in the cause, but the strict obedience that we a«re [bound too: I am the Goldsmith whose wrongs you talkte of, but how to redr«esse [yours or mine owne, is a matter beyond all our abilities.] Lin. [Not so, not so my good freends, I, though a meane man, a Broaker by profession «and] [namd Iohn Lincolne, haue long time winckt at these vilde ennormitees «with mighty] [impacience, and, as these two bretheren heere (Betses by name) can witnesse «with] [losse of mine owne liffe would gladly remedie them] Geo. [And he is in a good forwardnesse I tell ye, if all hit right.] Doll. [As how, I pre thee? tell it to Doll Willia«m»son.] Lin. [you knowe the Spittle Sermons begin the next weeke, I haue drawn a [of our wrongs, and the stra«un»gers insolencies.] Geo. [which he meanes the «pre»achers shall there openly p«u»blishe in the Pulpit Wil. [Oh but that they would, «y»faith it would tickle «our straun»gers «thorowly Doll. [I, and if you men durst «not vndertake it before God we women [an honest woman from her husband why it is intollerable] Sher. [But how finde ye the preachers affected to Lin. [M r doctor standish forme it and doubts not but happie successe will ensu our wrongs you shall» perceiue ther's no hurt in the Bill, heer's a copie of it, I pray ye, heare it. All with all» our harts, for Gods sake read it Lin reads [«to you» all the worshipfull Lords and maisters of this Cittie, that will tak«e com] [passion ouer the poore people your neighbours, and also of the greate importa«bl»e] [h«ur»ts, losses and hinderaunces, wherof proceedeth extreame pouertie to all the] [K«in»gs subiects, that inhabite within this Cittie and subburbs of the same. ffor] [so «it» is that Aliens and straungers eate the bread from the fatherlesse children,] [and take the liuing from all the Artificers, and the entercourse from all Merchan«ts] [wherby pouertie is so much encreased, that euery man bewayleth the miserie«] [of other, for crafts men be brought to beggerie, and Merchants to needines.] [wherfore, the premisses considered, the redresse must be of the c?mons, knit and] [vnited to one parte. And as the hurt and damage greeueth all men, so must] [all men see to their willing power for remedie, and not suffer the sayde] [Aliens in their wealth, and the naturall borne men of this region to come] [to confusion.] Doll. [Before God, tis excellent, and Ile maintaine the suite to be honest.] Sher. [well, say tis read, what is your further meaning in the matter?] Geo. [what? marie list to me. No doubt but this will store vs with freends enow,] [whose names we will «clo»sely keepe in writing, and on May day next in the] [morning weele goe foorth a Maying, but make it the wurst May day for] [the straungers that euer they sawe: how say ye? doo ye subscribe, or are ye] [faintharted reuolters] Doll. [Holde thee George Bettes, ther's my hand and my hart, by the Lord Ile make] [a Captaine among ye, and doo somewhat to be talke of for euer after.] Wil. [My maisters, ere we parte, lets freendly goe and drinke together, and sweare] [true secrecie vppon our liues.] Geo. [There spake an Angell, come, let[s] vs along then.] —exeunt.

Heare me Smart, thou art a foolish fellowe, If Lifter be conuicted by the lawe, As, I see not how the Iurie can acquit him: Ile stand too't, thou art guiltie of his death. Moore. My Lord, thats woorthe the hearing. L. Mai. Listen then good Maister Moore. Sure. I tell thee plaine, it is a shame for thee, with such a sum to tempte necessitie. No lesse then ten poundes Sir, will serue your turne, to «c»arie in your pursse about with ye, to crake and brag in Tauernes of your monie. I promise ye, a man that goes a broade, with an intent of trueth, meeting such a bootie may be prouokte to that he neuer meante. what makes so many pilferers and fellons, but such fond baites that foolish people lay: to tempt the needie miserable wretche. «ten poundes, odd monie, this is a prettie sum, to «bea»re about, whic«h were» more safe at home, «fore God twere well to fine y»e as much more Lord Maior and Moo«re whisper. to the releefe of the po soners, to teache ye be your owne. rightlie seru'de Moore.

Once agayne welcome, welcome my good Lord Maior, And bretheren all for once I was your brother, and so am still in hart. It is not state, that can our looue from London seperate. naught but pride. But they that cast an eye still whence they came, knowe how they rose, and how to vse the same. L. Maior. My Lord, you set a glosse on Londons fame, and make it happie euer by your name. Needs must we say, when we remember Moore, Twas he that droue rebellion from our doore. with graue discretions milde and gentle breath, sheelding a many subiects liues from death. Oh how our Cittie is by you renownde, And with your vertues our endeuours crownde. Moore. No more my good Lord Maior: but thanks to all, that on so short a summons, you would come to visite him that holdes your kindnesse deere. Madame, you are not merie with my Lady Maioresse, And these fayre Ladyes, pray ye seate them all, And heere my Lord, let me appoint your place the rest to seate them selues: Nay, Ile wearie ye, you will not long in haste to visite me.

Moore. wife, hope the best, I am sure theyle doo their best, they that would better, comes not at their feaste. My good Lord Cardinalles players, I thanke them for it, play vs a play, to lengthen out your welcome, [my good Lord Maior, and all my other freends.] They say it is the mariage of wit and wisedome, A theame of some importe, how ere it prooue: but if Arte faile, weele inche it out with looue. what, are they readie? Ser. My Lord, one of the Players craues to speake with you. Moore. with me? where is he? Enter Inclination the vise, readie. Incli. heere my Lord. Moore. How now? what's the matter? Incli. we would desire your honor but to stay a little, one of my fellowes is but run to Oagles, for a long beard for young witt, and heele be heere presently. Moore. A long beard for young witt? why man, he may be with out a beard till he come to mariage, for witt goes not all by the hayre: when comes witt in? Incli. In the second Scene, next to the Prologue my Lord. Moore. why play on till that Sceane come, and by that time witts beard will be growne, or else the fellowe returned with it. And what part plaist thou? Incli. Inclination the vice my Lord. Moore. Gramercies, now I may take the vice if I list: and wherfore hast thou that bridle in thy hand? Incli. I must be bridled annon my Lord. Moore. And thou beest not sadled too, it makes no matter, for then witts inclination may gallop so fast, that he will outstrip wisedome, and fall to follie. Incli. Indeed so he does to Lady vanitie: but we haue no follie in our play. Moore. Then ther's no witt in't, Ile be sworne: ffollie waites on witt, as the shaddowe on the bodie, and where witt is ripest, there follie still is readiest. But beginne I pre thee, weele rather allowe a beardlesse witt, then witt all bearde to haue no braine. Incli. Nay, he has his apparell on too my Lord, and therfore he is the readier to enter. Moore. Then good Inclination beginne at a venter. —exit. My Lord Maior: witt lacks a beard, or else they would beginne, Ide lend him mine, but that it is too thinne. Silence, they come. The Trompet soundes, enter the Prologue. Pro. Now for as much as in these latter dayes, throughout the whole world in euery land; vice dooth encrease and vertue decayes, Iniquitie hauing the vpper hand. we therfore intend good gentle Audience, a prettie short Enterlude to play at this present, desiring your leaue and quiet silence, to shewe the same as is meete and expedient. It is called the mariage of witt and wisedome, A matter right pithie and pleasing to heare, wherof in breefe we» will «shewe» the «whole summe But I must begon, for «witt dooth» appeare. —exit Enter Witt ruffling, and Inclination the vice. Witt. In an arbour greene, a sleepe where as I lay, The birdes sang sweetely in the midst of the day, I dreamed fast of mirthe and play, In youth is pleasure, in youthe is pleasure. Me thought I walked still to and fro, And from her companie I could not goe, But when I waked, it was not so, In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure. Therfore my hart is surely plight, Of her alone to haue a sight, which is my ioy and harts delight, In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure. Moore. Marke ye my Lord, this is witt without a bearde, what will he be, by that time he comes to the commoditie of a bearde? Incli. Oh Sir, the ground is the better on which she dooth goe. ffor she will make better cheere with a little she can get: then many a one can with a great banquet of meat. Witt. And is her name wisedome? Incli. I Sir, a wife moste fitt, for you my good maister, my daintie sweet Witt. Witt. To be in her companie, my hart it is set. therfore I pre thee to let vs begon: for vnto wisedome Witt hath Inclination. Incli Oh Sir, she will come her selfe euen annon. ffor I tolde her before where we would stand And then she sayd she would beck vs with her hand. Back with those boyes, and saucie great knaues, florishing his dagger. what, stand ye heere so bigge in your braues? my dagger about your coxecombes shall walke, if I may but so much as heare ye chat or talke. Witt. But will she take paines to come for vs hether? Incli. I warrant ye, therfore you must be familiare with her. when she commeth in place, you must her embrace, somewhat hansomely, Least she thinke it daunger, because you are a straunger, to come in your companie. Witt. I warrant thee Inclination, I will be busie, Oh how witt longs to be in wisedomes companie. Enter Lady Vanitie singing. and beckning with her hand. Van. Come hether, come hether, come hether come: Such cheere as I haue, thou shalt haue some. Moore. This is Lady Vanitie Ile holde my life: beware good witt, you take not her to wife. Incli. what, vnknowne honestie, a woord in your eare, you shall not be gon as yet I sweare. she offers to depart. Heer's none but your freends, you need not to fray, this young Gentleman looues ye, therfore you must stay. Witt. I trust in me she will thinke no daunger, for I looue well the companie of fayre women: And though to you I am a straunger, yet Witt may pleasure you now and then. Van. who you? nay you are such a holy man, that to touche one you dare not be bolde: I thinke you would not kisse a young woman, if one would giue ye twentie pound in golde. Witt. yes in good sadnesse Lady, that I would, I could finde in my hart to kisse you in your smock. Van. My back is broade enough to beare that mock. ffor it hath bin tolde me many a time: that you would be seene in no such companie as mine. Witt. Not Witt in the companie of Lady Wisedome? Oh Ioue for what doo I hether come? Incli. Sir, she did this nothing else but to prooue, whether a little thing would you mooue, to be angrie and frett: what and if one sayd so, let such trifling matters goe, and with a kinde kisse come out of her debt. Is Luggins come yet with the beard? Enter an other player. Player. No faith, he is not come, alas, what shall we doo? Incli. fforsooth we can goe no further, till our fellowe Luggins come,[s] for he plays good Councell, and now he should enter, to admonishe Witt, that this is Lad«y Vanitie, and not Lady Wisedome. Moore. Nay, and it be no more but so, ye shall not tarie at a stand for that, weele n«ot haue our play marde for lack of a little good Councell: till your fellowe co«me Ile geue him the best councell that I can, pardon me my Lord Maior, I lo«ue to «be» merie Moore. «oh witt,» th«ou art nowe on» the bowe hand, And blindely in thine owne oppinion doost stand. I tell thee, this naughtie lewde Inclination, Does lead thee amisse in a very straunge fashion. This is not Wisedome, but Lady Vanitie, therfore list to good councell, and be ruled by me. Incli. In troth my Lord, it is as right to Lugginses part, as can be, speake Witt. Moore. Nay, we will not haue our audience disappointed, if I can help it. Witt. Art thou good Councell, and wilt tell me so? wouldst thou haue Witt from Lady Wisedome to goe? Thou art some deceiuer, I tell thee verily, In saying that this is Lady Vanitie. Moore. Witt, iudge not things by the outwarde showe, the eye oft mistakes, right well you doo knowe. Good councell assures thee vppon his honestie, that this is not Wisedome, but Lady Vanitie. Enter Luggins with the bearde. Incli. Oh my Lord, he is come, now we shall goe forwarde. Moore. Art thou come? well fellowe, I haue holpe to saue thine honestie a little, Now, if thou canst giue witt any better councell then I haue doone, spare no«t there I leaue him to thy mercie. But by this time, I am sure our banquet's readie, My Lord, and Ladyes, we will taste that first, And then they shall begin the play againe, which through the fellowes absence, and by me, in sted of helping, hath bin hindered. Prepare against we come: Lights there I say, thus fooles oft times doo help to marre the play. —exeunt. ma. players. Witt. ffye fellowe Luggins, you serue vs hansomely, doo ye not thinke ye. Lug. why, Oagle was not with in, and his wife would not let me haue the beard, and by my troth I ran so fast that I sweat againe. Incli. doo ye heare fellowes? would not my Lord make a rare player? Oh, he would vpholde a companie beyond all hoe, better then Mason among the Kings players: did ye marke how extemprically he fell to the matter, and spake Lugginses parte, almoste as it is in the very booke set downe. Witt. Peace, doo ye knowe what ye say? my Lord a player? let vs not meddle with any such matters: yet I may be a little proude, that my Lord hath answerd m«e in my parte, but come, let vs goe and be readie to begin the play againe. Lug. I, thats the best, for now we lack nothing. —[exeunt.] Enter To the players wt h a reward Enter the Earles of Shrewesburie, Surrey, Bishop of Rochester and other Lordes, seuerally, dooing curtesie to eche other, Clark of the Councell waiting bareheaded. Sur. Good morrowe to my Lord of Shrewesburie. Shrew The like vnto the honourd Earle of Surrey. yond comes my Lord of Rochester. Rochest. Good morrowe my good Lordes Sur. Clarke of the Councell, what time ist of day? Clarke. Past eight of clock my Lord. Shrew. I wunder that my good Lord Chauncellour, dooth stay so long, considering ther's matters of high importaunce to be scand vppon. Sur. Clarke of the Councell, certefie his Lordship the Lordes expect him heere. Rochest. It shall not need. yond comes his Lordship. Enter Sr. Thomas Moore, with Pursse and Mace borne before him. Moore. Good morrowe to this faire assemblye. Come my good Lords, let's sit. Oh serious square, they sit. vppon this little borde is dayly scande the health and preseruation of the land. we the Phisitians that effect this good, now, by choise diett, annon, by letting blood. Our toyle and carefull watching, brings the King in league with slumbers, to which, peace dooth sing. Auoyde the roome there. what busines Lords to day? Shrew. This my good Lord. About the entertainement of the Emperour, gainst the perfidious ffrenche into our [our] pay. Sur. My Lords, as tis the custome in this place, the youngest should speake first, so, if I chaunce, in this case to speake youngly, pardon me. I will agree, ffraunce now hath her full strength as hauing newe recouered the pale blood which warre sluic'de foorth, and I consent to this, that the coniunction of our Englishe forces with armes of Germanie, may sooner bring this prize of conquest in. But then my Lordes, As in the morrall hunting «twixt the» Lyon, and other be«astes force ioynd frighted the weaker sharers from their partes. So if the Empires Soueraigne chaunce to put, his plea of partnership into warres Courte, Swoordes should discide the difference, and our blood: in priuate teares lament his entertainement. Shrew. To doubt the wurst is still the wise mans sheeld, that armes him safely, but the worlde knowes this, the Emperour is a man of royall faith. His looue vnto our Soueraigne, brings him downe, from his emperiall seate, to marche in pay vnder our English fflagge, and weare the crosse, like some high order on his manly breast. Thus seruing, hees not Maister of him selfe, but like a Collonell, c?maunding other, is by the Generall ouer-awed him selfe. Rochest. yet my good Lord. Shrew. Let me conclude my speeche. As subiects share no portion in the conquest of their true Soueraigne other then the meritt, that from the Soueraigne guerdons the true subiect: So the good Emperour in a freendly league of amitie with England, will not soyle his honor with the theft of Englishe spoyle. Moore There is no question, but this entertainement: will be moste honorable, moste c?modious. I haue oft heard good Captaines wish to haue riche Soldiours to attend them, such as would fight bothe for their liues and liuings. Such a one, is the good Emperour: I would to God, we had ten thousand of such able men, hah, then there would appeare, no Courte, no Cittie but where the warres were: they would pay them selues. Then to preuent in ffrenche warres, Englands losse: let Germaine flagges waue with our Englishe crosse. Enter Sir Thomas Palmer. Pal. My Lordes, his Maiestie hath sent by me these Articles enclosde, first to be viewde, and then to be subscribed to: I tender them, in that due reuerence which befitts this place. with greate reuerenc«e Moore. Subscribe these Articles? stay, let vs pause, our conscience first shall parley with our lawes. My Lord of Rochester, viewe you the paper. Rochest. Subscribe to these? now good Sir Thomas Palmer, beseeche the King that he will pardon me. My hart will check my hand whilste I doo write, subscribing so, I were an hipocrite. Pal. doo you refuse it then my Lord? Rochest. I doo Sir Thomas. Pal. [Then heere I summon you foorth with t'appeare,] [before his maiestie, to answere there] [this capitall contempt.] Rochest.

[Moste willingly, I goe.] [My Lordes, if you will visite me at Chelsey,] [weele goe a fishing, and with a cunning nett,] [not like weake filme, weele catche none but the great.] [ffarewell my noble Lordes: why this is right,] [good morrowe to the Sunne, to state good night.] —ex. Moore. Pal. will you subscribe my Lordes? Sur. [Instantly good Sir Thomas,] [weele bring the writing vnto our Soueraigne.] they write. Pal. [My Lord of Rochester,] [you must with me, to answere this contempt.] Roches. [This is the wurst,] [who's fre«ed from» life, is from all care exempt.] —ex. Ro. &amp; Pal. Sur. [«now let vs to our Soueraign»e.] tis straunge» that my «lord» Chauncellour should refuse the dutie that the lawe of God bequeathes vnto the King. Shrew. Come, let vs in, no doubt, his minde will alter, and the Bishops too, Errour in learned heads hath much to doo. Enter the Lady Moore, her two daughters, and Mr. Roper, as walking Ro. Madame, what ayles yee for to looke so sad. Lady. Troth Sonne, I knowe not what, I am not sick, and yet I am not well: I would be merie but somewhat lyes so heauie on my hart: I cannot chuse but sigh. You are a Scholler, I pray ye tell me, may one credit dreames? Ro. why ask you that, deare Madame? Lady. Because to night, I had the straungest dreame, that ere my sleep was troubled with. Me thought twas night, And that the King and Queene went on the Themes, in Bardges to heare musique: My Lord and I were in a little boate me thought, Lord, Lord, what straunge things liue in slumbers? And beeing neere, we grapled to the Bardge that bare the King. But after many pleasing voyces spent, in that still moouing musique house: me thought, the violence of the streame did seuer vs quite from the golden fleet, and hurried vs, vnto the bridge, which with vnused horror, we entred at full tide, thence some flight shoote, beeing caried by the waues: our boate stood still iust opposite the Tower, and there it turnde, and turnde about, as when a whirle-poole sucks the circkled waters: me thought that we bothe cryed, till that we sunck, where arme in arme we dyed. Ro. Giue no respect, deare Madame to fond dreames, they are but slight illusions of the blood. Lady. Tell me not all are so, for often dreames, are true diuiners, either of good or ill. I cannot be in quiet, till I heare, how my Lord fares. Ro. aside. Nor I. Come hether wife I will not fright thy mother, to interprete the nature of a dreame: but trust me sweete, this night I haue bin troubled with thy father: beyond all thought. Ro. wife.
