      <field name="fulltext">âTo rear the tender thought, âTo teach the young idea how to shoot, âTo pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind, âTo breathe th'enliv'ning spirit, and to fix âThe gen'rous purpose in the Female breast.â THOMSON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO MRS. GWATKIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. (Spoken by a Young Lady at a private Representation.) With trembling diffidence, with modest fear, Before this gentle Audience we appear. Ladies, survey us with a tender eye; Put on good-nature, and lay judgment by. No deep-laid plot adorns our humble page, But scenes adapted to our sex and age. Simplicity is all our Author's aim; She does not write, nor do we speak for fame. To make Amusement and Instruction friends, A lesson in the guise of play she sends. She claims no merit but her love of truth; No plea to favourâbut her sex and youth: With these alone to boast, she sends me here To beg your kind, indulgent, partial ear.â Of Critic Man she could not stand the test; But Youâwith softer, gentler hearts are blest. With Him she dares not rest her feeble cause: A mark too low for satire or applause. Ladies, protect herâdo not be satiric; Spare censureâshe expects not panegyric.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene, a Grove. EUPHELIA, CLEORA, PASTORELLA, LAURINDA. CLEORA. Welcome, ye humble vales, ye flow'ry shades, Ye chrystal fountains, and ye silent glades! From the gay mis'ry of the thoughtless great, The walks of folly, the disease of state; From scenes where daring Guilt triumphant reigns, Its dark suspicions and its hoard of pains; Where Pleasure never comes without alloy, And Art but thinly paints fallacious joy; Where Languor loads the day; Excess the night, And dull Satiety succeeds delight; Where midnight Vices their fell orgies keep, And guilty Revels scare the phantom Sleep; Where Dissipation wears the name of Bliss: From these we fly in search of Happiness. EUPHELIA. Not the tir'd Pilgrim, all his dangers past, When he descries the long-sought shrine at last, E'er felt a joy so pure as this fair field, These peaceful shades, and smiling vallies yield; For, sure, these oaks, which old as Time appear, Proclaim Urania's lonely dwelling near. PASTORELLA. How the description with the scene agrees! Here lowly thickets, there aspiring trees; The hazel copse excluding noon-day's beam, The tufted arbor, the pellucid stream; The blooming sweet-briar, and the hawthorn shade, The springing cowslips and the daisy'd mead, The wild luxuriance of the full-blown fields, Which Spring prepares, and laughing Summer yields. EUPHELIA. Here simple Nature strikes th'enraptur'd eye With charms, which wealth and art but ill supply; The genuine graces, which without we find, Display the beauty of the owner's mind. LAURINDA. These deep embow'ring shades conceal the cell Where sage Urania and her daughters dwell: Florella too, if right we've heard the tale, With them resides the lily of the vale. CLEORA. But soft! What gentle female form appears, Which smiles of more than mortal beauty wears? Is it the Guardian Genius of the grove? Or some fair Angel from the choirs above? Enter FLORELLA who speaks. Whom do I see? Ye beauteous virgins, say, What chance conducts your steps this lonely way? Do you pursue some fav'rite lambkin stray'd? Or do yon alders court you to their shade? Declare, fair strangers: if aright I deem, No rustic nymphs of vulgar rank you seem. CLEORA. No cooling shades allure our eager sight, Nor lambkins lost, our searching steps invite. FLORELLA. Or is it, haply, yonder branching vine, Whose trunk the woodbine's fragrant tendrils twine? Whose spreading height, with purple clusters crown'd, Attracts the gaze of ev'ry nymph around? Have these lone regions aught that charm beside Florella's shades, her flow'rs, her fleecy pride? EUPHELIA. Florella! our united thanks receive; Sole proof of gratitude we have to give: And since you deign to ask, O courteous Fair, The motive of our unremitting care, Know then, 'tis Happiness we would obtain; That charming prize our ardent wish would gain. By Fancy's mimic pencil oft pourtray'd, Still have we woo'd the visionary maid: The lovely phantom mocks our eager eyes; And still we chace, and still we miss the prize! CLEORA. Long have we search'd throughout this bounteous isle, With constant ardor and with ceaseless toil: The various ways of various life we've try'd; But Peace, sweet Peace, has ever been deny'd. We've sought in vain thro' ev'ry diff'rent state; The rich, the poor, the lowly, and the great. Does she with kings in palaces reside? Or dwell obscurely, far from pomp and pride? To learn this truth, we've bid a long adieu To all the shadows blinded men pursue. âWe seek Urania; her whose virtues fire Our virgin hearts to be what we admire: Fair Fame has blazon'd her accomplish'd mind; The lovely mansion of the Graces join'd: For tho' with care she shuns the public eye, Yet worth like hers, unknown can never lie. LAURINDA. On such a fair and faultless model form'd, By Prudence guided, and by Virtue warm'd, Perhaps Florella can direct our youth, And point our footsteps to the paths of truth. FLORELLA. Ill would it suit my unexperienc'd age In such important questions to engage. Young as I am, unskilful to discern, Nor fit to teach, who yet have much to learn. But would you with maturer years advise, And reap the counsel of the truly wise, The Dame you seek inhabits yonder cell: In her united, worth and wisdom dwell. Poor, not dejected; humble, yet not mean; Cheerful, tho' grave; and lively, tho' serene; Benevolent, kind, pious, gentle, just; Reason her guide, and Providence her trust. If Heav'n, indulgent to her little store, Adds to that littleâbut a little more, With pious praise her grateful heart o'erflows, And sweetly mitigates the suff'rer's woes. Her labours for devotion best prepare, And meek Devotion smooths the brow of care. Two lovely daughters make her little state; The dearest blessings of propitious Fate. Under her kind protecting wing I live: She gives to all; for she has much to give, Since Heav'n has blest her with an ample heart, That Wisdom's noblest treasures can impart; But (just in all its dispensations) join'd A narrow fortune to a noble mind. PASTORELLA. Her bright perfections charm my list'ning ear! Elate with hope, we come to seek her here. Then lead, Florella, to that humble shed Where Peace resides: from courts and cities fled! A SONG. I. O Happiness, celestial Fair, Our earliest hope, our latest care, O hear our fond request! Vouchsafe, reluctant Nymph, to tell On what sweet spot thou lov'st to dwell, And make us truly blest. II. Amidst the walks of public life, The toils of wealth, ambition's strife, We long have sought in vain; The crowded city's noisy din, And all the busy haunts of men, Afford but care and pain. III. Pleas'd with the soft, the soothing pow'r Of calm reflection's silent hour, Sequester'd dost thou dwell! Where care and tumult ne'er intrude, Dost thou reside with Solitude, Thy humble vot'ries tell? IV. O Happiness, celestial Fair, Our earliest hope, our latest care! Let us not sue in vain! O deign to hear our fond request, Come, take possession of our breast, And there for ever reign. [They retire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, the Grove. URANIA, SYLVIA, ELIZA. A SONG BY SYLVIA. I. SWEET Solitude, thou placid Queen Of modest air, and brow serene! 'Tis thou inspir'st the Sage's themes; The Poet's visionary dreams. II. Parent of Virtue, Nurse of Thought! By thee were Saints and Patriarchs taught; Wisdom from thee her treasures drew, And in thy lap fair Science grew. III. Whate'er exalts, refines, and charms, Invites to thought, to virtue warms; Whate'er is perfect, fair, and good, We owe to thee, sweet Solitude! IV. In these blest shades, O still maintain Thy peaceful, unmolested reign! Let no disorder'd thoughts intrude On thy repose, sweet Solitude! V. With thee the charm of life shall last, E'en when its rosy bloom is past; And when slow pacing Time shall spread Its silver blossoms o'er my head, VI. No more with this vain world perplex'd, Thou shalt prepare me for the next; The springs of life shall gently cease, And Angels point the way to peace. URANIA. Ye tender objects of maternal love, Ye dearest joys Urania e'er can prove, Come, taste the glories of the new-born day, And grateful homage to its Author pay! O! ever may this animating sight Convey instruction while it sheds delight! Does not that Sun, whose cheering beams impart Joy's glad emotions to the poor of heart; Does not that vivid pow'r teach ev'ry mind To be as warm, benevolent, and kind; To burn with unremitted ardor still, Like him to execute their Maker's will? Then let us, Pow'r Supreme! thy will adore, Invoke thy mercies, and proclaim thy pow'r. Shalt thou these benefits in vain bestow? Shall we forget the Source from whence they flow? Teach us thro' these to lift our hearts to Thee, And in the gift the bounteous Giver see. To view Thee as thou art, all good and wise, Nor let thy blessings hide Thee from our eyes. From all obstructions clear our mental sight; Pour on our souls thy beatific light! Teach us thy wond'rous goodness to revere, With love to worship, and with rev'rence fear! In the mild works of thy benignant hand, As in the thunder of thy dread command. In common objects we neglect thy pow'r, Nor heed a miracle in ev'ry slow'r; Yet neither hurricanes nor storms proclaim In plainer language thy Almighty Name. âTell me, my first, my last, my darling care, If you this morn have rais'd your hearts in pray'r? Say, did you rise from the sweet bed of rest, Your God unprais'd, his holy name unblest? SYLVIA. Our minds with gratitude and rev'rence fraught, By those pure precepts you have ever taught; By your example more than precept strong, Of pray'r and praise have tun'd our matin song. ELIZA. And now, with ever new delight, attend The counsels of our fond maternal friend. Enter Florella, with Euphelia, Cleora, Pastorella, Laurinda. FLORELLA. (Aside to the Ladies.) See how the goodly dame, with pious art, Makes ev'ry thing a lesson to the heart! Observe the duteous list'ners, how they stand! Improvement and delight go hand in hand. URANIA. But where's Florella? FLORELLA. Here's the happy she, Whom Heav'n most favour'd when it gave her thee. URANIA. But who are these, in whose attractive mien, So sweetly blended, ev'ry grace is seen? Speak, my Florella, say the cause why here These beauteous damsels on our plains appear? FLORELLA. Invited hither by Urania's fame, To seek her friendship, to these shades they came. Straying alone at morning's earliest dawn, I met them wand'ring on the verdant lawn. Their courteous manners soon engag'd my love: I've brought them here your sage advice to prove. URANIA. Tell me, ye gentle nymphs, the reason tell, Which brings such guests to grace my lowly cell? Ask what we have to giveâit is not ours: Heav'n has but lent it us to make it yours. CLEORA. Your counsel, your advice, is all we ask; And for Urania that's no irksome task. 'Tis Happiness we seek: O deign to tell Where the coy fugitive delights to dwell! URANIA. Ah, rather say, where you have sought this guest, This lovely inmate of the virtuous breast? Declare the various methods you've essay'd To court and win the bright celestial maid. But first, tho' harsh the task, each beauteous fair Her ruling passion must with truth declare. EUPHELIA. Bred in the regal splendors of a court, Where Pleasures, dress'd in ev'ry shape, resort, I try'd the pow'r of pomp and costly glare, Nor e'er found room for thought, or time for pray'r; In diff'rent follies ev'ry hour I spent; Without reflection whence could rise content? My hours were shar'd betwixt the Park and Play, And music serv'd to waste the tedious day; Yet softest airs no more with joy I heard, Soon as some sweeter warbler was preferr'd; The dance succeeded, and, succeeding, tir'd, If some more graceful dancer was admir'd. No sounds but flatt'ry ever sooth'd my ear: Ungentle truths I knew not how to bear. The anxious day induc'd the sleepless night, And my vex'd spirit never knew delight. Coy Pleasure mock'd me with delusive charms; Still the thin shadow fled my clasping arms: Or if some actual joy I seem'd to taste, Another's pleasures laid my blessings waste: A fairer face would rob my soul of rest, And fix a scorpion in my wounded breast. Or, if my elegance of form prevail'd, And haply her inferior graces fail'd; Yet still some cause of wretchedness I found, Some barbed shaft my shatter'd peace to wound. Perhaps her gay attire exceeded mineâ When she was finer, how could I be fine? SYLVIA. Pardon my interruption, beauteous maid! Can truth have prompted what you just have said? Do you believe it possible, that dress Can lessen or advance your Happiness? Or that your robes, tho' splendid, rich, and fine, Possess intrinsic value more than mine? URANIA. So close our nature is to vice ally'd, Our very comforts are the source of pride; Too much we move by Custom's slavish rule; Too often Fashion constitutes the fool. CLEORA. Of Happiness unfound I too complain, Sought in a diff'rent path, but sought in vain: I sigh'd for Fame, I languish'd for renown, I would be prais'd, caress'd, admir'd, and known. On daring wing my mounting spirit soar'd, And Science through her boundless fields explor'd: I scorn'd the salique laws of pedant schools, Which chain our genius down by tasteless rules: I long'd to burst these female bonds, which held My sex in awe, by vanity impell'd. To boast each various faculty of mind, Thy graces, Pope! with Johnson's learning join'd: Like Swift, with strongly pointed ridicule, To brand the villain, and abash the fool: To judge with taste, with spirit to compose, Now mount in epic, now descend to prose; To join, like Burke, the Beauteous and Sublime, Or build, with Milton's art, âthe lofty rhyme;â Thro' Fancy's fields I rang'd; I strove to hit Melmoth's chaste style, and Colman's easy wit: Thy classic graces, Mason, to display, And court the Muse of Elegy with Gray: I rav'd of Shakespeare's flame, and Dryden's rage, And long'd for ev'ry charm of Otway's melting page. I talk'd by rote the jargon of the schools, Of critic laws, and Aristotle's rules; Of passion, sentiment, and style, and grace, And unities of action, time, and place. Howe'er the conduct of my life might err, Still my dramatic plans were regular. URANIA. Who aims at ev'ry science, soon will find The field how vast, how limited the mind! CLEORA. Abstruser studies soon my fancy caught, The poet in th'astronomer forgot: The schoolmens systems now my mind employ'd, Their chrystal Spheres, their Atoms and their Void. Newton and Halley all my soul inspir'd, And numbers less than calculations fir'd; Descartes, and Euclid shar'd my varying breast, And plans and problems all my soul possess'd. Less pleas'd to sing inspiring PhÅbus' ray Than mark the flaming comet's devious way. The pale moon dancing on the silver stream, And the mild lustre of her trembling beam, No more could charm my philosophic pride, Which sought her influence on the flowing tide. No more ideal beauties fir'd my thought, Which only facts and demonstrations sought. Let common eyes, I said, with transport view The earth's bright verdure, or the heav'n's soft blue, False is the pleasure, the delight is vain, Colours exist but in the vulgar brain. I now with Locke trod metaphysic soil, Now chas'd coy Nature thro' the tracts of Boyle; Sigh' for their fame, but fear'd to share their toil. The laurel wreath, Ambition fondly twin'd, To deck my youthful temples I design'd; Some learn'd authority I still would bring To grace my talk, and proveâthe plainest thing: This the chief transport I from science drew, That all might know how much Cleora knew. Not love, but wonder, I aspir'd to raise, And miss'd affection, while I grasp'd at praise. PASTORELLA. To me, no joys could pomp or fame impart: Far softer thoughts possess'd my virgin heart. No prudent parent form'd my ductile youth, Nor pointed out the lovely paths of truth. Left to myself to cultivate my mind, Pernicious Novels their soft entrance find: Their pois'nous influence led my mind astray: I sigh'd for something; what, I could not say. I fancy'd virtues which were never seen, And dy'd for heroes who have never been; I sicken'd with disgust at sober sense, And loath'd the pleasures worth and truth dispense; I scorn'd the manners of the world I saw; My guide was fiction, and romance my law. Distemper'd thoughts my wand'ring fancy fill, Each wind a zephyr, and each brook a rill; I found adventures in each common tale, And talk'd and sigh'd to ev'ry passing gale; Convers'd with echoes, woods, and shades, and bow'rs, Cascades, and grottos, fields, and streams, and flow'rs. Retirement, more than crowds, had learn'd to please; For treach'rous Leisure feeds the soft disease. There, plastic Fancy ever moulds at will Th'obedient image with a dang'rous skill; The charming fiction, with alluring art, Awakes the passions, and infects the heart. A fancy'd heroine an ideal wife; I loath'd the offices of real life: Each duty to perform observant still But those which God and Nature bade me fill. ELIZA. (To Urania.) Preserve me from the errors of deceit, And all the dangers wealth and beauty meet! PASTORELLA. Reason perverted, Fancy on her throne, My soul to all my sex's softness prone; I neither spoke nor look'd as mortal ought; By Sense abandon'd, and by Folly taught: A victim to Imagination's sway, Which stole my health, and rest, and peace away: Professions, void of meaning, I receiv'd, And still I found them falseâand still believ'd: Imagin'd all who courted me approv'd; Who prais'd, esteem'd me; and who flatter'd, lov'd. Fondly I hop'd (now vain those hopes appear) Each man was faithful, and each maid sincere. Still Disappointment mock'd the ling'ring day; Still new-born wishes led my soul astray. When in the rolling year no joy I find, I trust the next, the next will sure be kind. The next, fallacious as the last appears, And sends me on to still remoter years. They come, they promiseâbut forget to give: I live not, but I still intend to live. At length, deceiv'd in all my schemes of bliss, I join'd these three in search of Happiness. ELIZA. Is this the world of which we want a sight? Are these the beings who are call'd polite? SYLVIA. If so, oh gracious Heav'n! hear Sylvia's prayer: Preserve me still in humble virtue here! Far from such baneful pleasures may I live, And keep, O keep me, from the taint they give! LAURINDA. No love of Fame my torpid bosom warms, No Fancy sooths me, and no Pleasure charms; Yet still remote from Happiness I stray, No guiding star illumes my trackless way. Tho' neither Wit misleads, nor Passion goads, The deadly rust of Indolence corrodes; This eating canker, with malignant stealth, Destroys the vital pow'rs of moral health. ELIZA. (To Urania.)

Till now, I've slept on Life's tumultuous tide, No principle of action for my guide. From Ignorance my chief misfortunes flow; I never wish'd to learn, or car'd to know. With ev'ry folly slow-pac'd Time beguil'd: In size a woman, but in soul a child. In slothful ease my moments crept away, And busy trifles fill'd the tedious day; I liv'd extempore, as Fancy fir'd, As Chance directed, or Caprice inspir'd. Too indolent to think, too weak to chuse, Too soft to blame, too gentle to refuse; My character was stamp'd from those around: The figures they, my mind the simple ground. Fashion, with monstrous forms, the canvas stain'd, Till nothing of my genuine self remain'd; My pliant soul from Chance receiv'd its bent, And neither good perform'd, or evil meant. From right to wrong, from vice to virtue thrown, No character possessing of its own. To shun fatigue I made my only law; Yet ev'ry night my wasted spirits saw. No energy inform'd my languid mind; No joy the idle e'er must hope to find. Weak indecision all my actions sway'd; The day was lost before the choice was made. Tho' more to folly than to guilt inclin'd, A dear vacuity possess'd my mind. Too old with infant sports to be amus'd, Unfit for converse, and to books unus'd, The wise avoided me, they could not hear My senseless prattle with a patient ear. I sought retreat, but found, with strange surprise, Retreat is pleasant only to the wise; The crowded world by vacant minds is sought, Because it saves th'expence and pain of thought. Disgusted, restless, ev'ry plan amiss, I come with these in search of Happiness. URANIA. O happy they for whom, in early age, Enlight'ning knowledge spreads her letter'd page! Teaches each headstrong passion to controul, And pours her lib'ral lesson on the soul! Ideas grow from books, their nat'ral food, As aliment is chang'd to vital blood. Tho' faithless Fortune strip her vot'ry bare, Tho' Malice haunt him, and tho' Envy tear, Nor time, nor chance, nor want, can e'er destroy This soul-felt solace, and this bosom joy! CLEORA. We thus, united by one common fate, Resolv'd on virtue, if not yet too late, Have form'd a friendship, which thro' life shall last, And vows, and choice, and love have bound it fast. Each left her title and exchang'd her name; For Virtue panting, careless now of Fame. URANIA. Your candour, beauteous damsels, I approve, Your foibles pity, and your merits love. How few, O sacred Virtue! can acquire That heartfelt transport thy pure flames inspire! But ere I say the methods you must try To gain the glorious prize for which you sigh, Your fainting strength and spirits must be cheer'd With a plain meal, by Temperance prepar'd. FLORELLA. No luxury our humble board attends; But Love and Concord are its smiling friends. A SONG BY FLORELLA. I. HAIL, artless Simplicity, beautiful maid, In the genuine attractions of Nature array'd; Let the rich and the proud, and the gay and the vain, Still laugh at the graces that move in thy train. II. No charm in thy modest allurements they find; The pleasures they follow a sting leave behind. Can criminal passion enrapture the breast Like virtue, with peace and serenity blest? III. O would you Simplicity's precepts attend, Like us, with delight at her altar you'd bend; The pleasures she yields would with joy be embrac'd; You'd practise from virtue, and love them from taste. IV. The linnet enchants us the bushes among: Tho' cheap the musician, yet sweet is the song; We catch the soft warbling in air as it floats, And with ecstacy hang on the ravishing notes. V. Our water is drawn from the clearest of springs, And our food, nor disease nor satiety brings; Our mornings are cheerful, our labours are blest, Our ev'nings are pleasant, our nights crown'd with rest. VI. From our culture yon garden its ornament finds, And we catch at the hint for improving our minds; To live to some purpose we constantly try, And we mark by our actions the days as they fly. VII. Since such are the joys that Simplicity yields, We may well be content with our woods and our fields: How useless to us then, ye great, were your wealth, When without it we purchase both pleasure and health! [They retire into the Cottage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, a Rural Entertainment. FLORELLA, EUPHELIA, CLEORA, LAURINDA, AND PASTORELLA. A SONG BY FLORELLA. I. WHILE Beauty and Pleasure are now in their prime, And Folly and Fashion expect our whole time, Ah! let not those phantoms our wishes engage; Let us live so in youth, that we blush not in age. II. Tho' the vain and the gay may attend us a while, Yet let not their flatt'ry our prudence beguile; Let us covet those charms that will never decay, Nor listen to all that deceivers can say. III. âHow the tints of the rose and the jess'mines perfume! âThe eglantine's fragrance, the lilac's gay bloom, âTho' fair and tho' fragrant, unheeded may lie, âFor that neither is sweet when Florella is by.â IV. I sigh not for beauty, nor languish for wealth, But grant me, kind Providence, virtue and health; Then, richer than kings, and as happy as they, My days shall pass sweetly and swiftly away. V. When age shall steal on me, and youth is no more, And the moralist Time shakes his glass at my door, What charm in lost beauty or wealth should I find? My treasure, my wealth, is a sweet peace of mind. VI. That peace I'll preserve then, as pure as was giv'n, And taste in my bosom an earnest of Heav'n; For Virtue and Wisdom can warm the cold scene, And sixty may flourish as gay as sixteen. VII. And when long I the burthen of life shall have borne, And death with his sickle shall cut the ripe corn, Resign'd to my fate, without murmur or sigh, I'll bless the kind summons, and lie down and die, EUPHELIA. Thus sweetly pass the hours of rural ease! Here life is bliss, and pleasures truly please! PASTORELLA. With joy we view the dangers we have past, Assur'd we've found Felicity at last. FLORELLA. Expect not perfect Happiness below, Nor heav'nly plants on earth's low soil to grow. Esteem none happy by their outward air; All have their portion of allotted care. Tho' Prudence wears the semblance of content When the full heart with agony is rent; Secludes its anguish from the public sight, And feeds on sorrow with a sad delight; Shuns ev'ry eye to cherish darling grief, This fond indulgence its supreme relief. By love directed, and in mercy meant, Are trials suffer'd, and afflictions sent; To stem impetuous passion's furious tide, To curb the insolence of prosp'rous pride, To wean from earth, and bid our wishes soar To that blest clime where pain shall be no more; Where weary'd virtue shall for refuge fly, And ev'ry tear be wip'd from ev'ry eye. CLEORA. List'ning to you, my heart can never cease To rev'rence virtue, and to sigh for peace. FLORELLA. Know, e'en Urania, that accomplish'd Fair, Whose goodness makes her Heav'n's peculiar care, Full oft, ere she her present peace attain'd, The bitter cup of woe has deeply drain'd: In affluence born, and bred in splendid state, Has felt the cruelest extreme of fate; Yet meek, resign'd, and patient in distress, She knew, the hand that wounds has pow'r to bless: Instead of murm'ring at his sacred will, Grateful she bow'd for what was left her still. He who our frail mortality did bear, Tho' free from sin, was not exempt from care; Taught by his precepts, by his practice taught, Her will submitted, and resign'd her thought, Through faith, she look'd beyond these earthly scenes To where nor pain nor sorrow intervenes. Enter Urania, Sylvia, Eliza. URANIA. Since, gentle Nymphs, my friendship to obtain, You've sought with eager step this peaceful plain, My honest counsel with attention hear, Tho' plain, well meant, imperfect, yet sincere; What from maturer years alone I've known, What time has taught me, and experience shewn; No polish'd phrase my artless speech will grace, But unaffected candour fill its place: My lips shall flatt'ry's smooth deceit refuse; And truth be all the eloquence I'll use. Know then, that life's chief happiness and woe, From good or evil education flow; And hence our future dispositions rise; The vice we practise, or the good we prize. When pliant Nature any form receives That precept teaches, or example gives, The yielding mind with virtue should be grac'd, For first impressions seldom are effac'd. If Ignorance her iron sway maintain, If Prejudice preside, or Passion reign, The erring principle is rooted fast, And fix'd the temper that thro' life may last. PASTORELLA. With heartfelt penitence we now deplore Those squander'd hours, that time can ne'er restore. URANIA. Euphelia sighs for flatt'ry, dress, and show: Too common sources these of female woe! In Beauty's sphere pre-eminence to find, She slights the culture of th'immortal Mind: I would not rail at Beauty's charming pow'r, I would but have her aim at something more; The fairest symmetry of form or face, From intellect receives its highest grace; The brightest eyes ne'er dart such piercing fires As when a soul irradiates and inspires. Beauty with reason needs not quite dispense; And coral lips may sure speak common sense. Beauty makes Virtue lovelier still appear; Virtue makes Beauty more divinely fair! Confirms its conquest o'er the willing mind, And those your beauties gain, your virtues bind. Yet would Ambition's fire your bosom fill, Its flame repress notâbe ambitious still; Let nobler views your best attention claim, The object chang'd, the passion be the same. Indulge the true ambition to excel In that best art,âthe art of living well. All other faults may take a higher aim, But hopeless Envy must be still the same. Anger and pride we may convert to good, But Envy must subdue, or be subdu'd. This fatal gangrene to our moral life, Rejects all palliatives, and asks the knife; Excision spar'd, it taints the vital part, And spreads its deadly venom to the heart. EUPHELIA. Unhappy those to bliss who seek the way, In pow'r superior, or in splendor gay! Inform'd by thee, no more vain man shall find The charm of flatt'ry taint Euphelia's mind: By thee instructed, still my views shall rise, Nor stop at any mark beneath the skies. URANIA. In fair Laurinda's uninstructed mind, The want of culture, not of sense, we find; Whene'er you sought the good, or shunn'd the ill, 'Twas more from temper than from principle: Your random life to no just rules reduc'd, 'Twas chance the virtue or the vice produc'd. The casual goodness Impulse has to boast, Like morning dews, or transient show'rs, is lost; While Heav'n-taught Virtue pours her constant tide, Like streams by living fountains still supply'd. Be Wisdom still, tho' late, your earnest care, Nor waste the precious hours in vain despair: Associate with the good, attend the sage, And meekly listen to experienc'd age. What, if acquirements you have fail'd to gain, Such as the wise may want, the bad attain, Yet still Religion's sacred treasures lie Inviting, open, plain to ev'ry eye; For ev'ry age, for ev'ry genius fit, Nor limited to science nor to wit; To elevated talents not confin'd; But all may learn the truths for all design'd: She calls, solicits, courts you to be blest, And points to mansions of eternal rest. And when, advanc'd in years, matur'd in sense, Think not with farther care you may dispense; 'Tis fatal to the int'rests of the soul To stop the race before we've reach'd the goal; For nought our higher progress can preclude So much as thinking we're already good. The human heart ne'er knows a state of rest: Bad leads to worse, and better tends to best. We either gain or lose, we sink or rise, Nor rests our struggling Nature till she dies. Then place the standard of Perfection high; Pursue and grasp it, e'en beyond the sky. LAURINDA. O that important Time could back return Those mis-spent hours, whose loss I deeply mourn! Accept, just Heav'n, my penitence sincere, My heartfelt anguish, and my fervent pray'r! URANIA. I pity Pastorella's hapless fate, By nature gentle, gen'rous, mild, yet great: One false propension all her pow'rs confin'd, And chain'd her finer faculties of mind; Yet ev'ry virtue might have flourish'd there With early culture, and maternal care. If good, we plant not; Vice will fill the place, And rankest weeds the richest soils deface. Learn, how ungovern'd thoughts the mind pervert, And to disease all nourishment convert. Ah! happy she, whose wisdom learns to find A healthful fancy, and a well train'd mind! A sick man's wildest dreams less wild are found Than the day-visions of a mind unsound. Disorder'd phantasies, indulg'd too much, Like harpies, always taint whate'er they touch. Fly soothing Solitude! fly vain Desire! Fly such soft verse as fans the dang'rous fire! Seek action; 'tis the scene which Virtue loves: The vig'rous sun not only shines, but moves. From sickly thoughts with quick abhorrence start, And rule the fancy if you'd rule the heart: Those very passions that our peace invade, If rightly pointed, blessings may be made: Then rise, my friend, above terrestrial aims, Direct the ardor which your breast inflames To that pure region of eternal joys, Where fear disturbs not, nor possession cloys; Beyond what Fancy forms of rosy bow'rs, Or blooming chaplets of unfading flow'rs; Fairer than e'er imagination drew, Or poet's warmest visions ever knew. Press eager onward to those blissful plains Where one unbounded Spring for ever reigns PASTORELLA. I mourn the errors of my thoughtless youth, And long, with thee, to tread the paths of truth. URANIA. Learning is all the bright Cleora's aim; She seeks the loftiest pinnacle of fame; On interdicted ground presumes to stand, And grasps at Science with a vent'rous hand: The privilege of Man she dares invade, And tears the chaplet from his laurel'd head. Why found her merit on a foreign claim? Why lose a substance to acquire a name? Let the proud sex possess their vaunted pow'rs; Be other triumphs, other glories, ours! The gentler charms which wait on female life, Which grace the Daughter and adorn the Wife, Be these our boast; yet these may well admit Of various knowledge, and of blameless wit: Of sense, resulting from a nurtur'd mind, Of polish'd converse, and of taste refin'd; Of that quick intuition of the best, Which feels the graceful, and rejects the rest: Which finds the right by shorter ways than rules: An art which Nature teachesânot the schools. Thus conq'ring Sevigne the heart obtains, While Dacier only admiration gains. Know, fair Aspirer, could you ever hope To speak like Stonehouse, or to write like Pope, To join like Ferney's, or like Hagley's sage, Th'Historic, Ethic, and Poetic page, With all the pow'rs of wit and judgment fraught, The flow of style and the sublime of thought; Yet, if the milder graces of the mind, Graces peculiar to the sex design'd, Good-nature, patience, sweetness void of art; If these embellish'd not your virgin heart, You might be dazzling, but not truly bright; A pompous glare, but not an useful light; A meteor, not a star, you would appear; For Woman shines but in her proper sphere. Accomplishments by Nature were design'd Less to adorn than to amend the mind: Each should contribute to this gen'ral end, And all to virtue, as their centre, tend. Th'acquirements, which our best esteem invite, Shou'd not project, but soften, mix, unite: In glaring light not strongly be display'd, But sweetly lost, and melted into shade. CLEORA. Confus'd with shame, to thy reproofs I bend, Thou best adviser, and thou truest friend! From thee I'll learn to judge and act aright, Humility with Knowledge to unite: The finish'd character must both combine The perfect woman must in either shine. URANIA. Florella shines adorn'd with every grace, Her heart all virtue, as all charms her face: Above the wretched, and below the great, Kind Heav'n has fix'd her in a middle state; From rich and poor, at equal distance thrown, The smile invidious, and th'insulting frown; The dÃ¦mon Fashion never warp'd her soul, Her passions move at Reason's wise controul; Her eyes the movements of her heart declare, For what she dares to be, she dares appear; Unlectur'd in Dissimulation's school, To smile by precept, and to blush by rule: Her thoughts ingenuous, ever open lie, Nor shrink from close Inspection's keenest eye; No dark disguise about her heart is thrown, 'Tis Virtue's int'rest fully to be known; Her nat'ral sweetness ev'ry heart obtains, What Art and Affectation miss, she gains. She smooths the path of my declining years, Augments my comforts, and divides my cares. PASTORELLA. O sacred Friendship! O exalted state! The choicest bounty of indulgent fate! URANIA. Would you, ye fair, the bright example give, Fir'd with ambition, men like you would live; Would chuse for merit, and esteem for sense, And taste the solid transports these dispense; Would rouse at Virtue's, and at Honour's voice, And love from reason, whom they lik'd from choice: Then marriage would with peace go hand in hand, And Concord's temple close to Hymen's stand. Nor think that vice alone obstructs our bliss, On Temper's basis stands the throne of Peace. Let Woman then her real good discern, And her true inter'sts of Urania learn; Her lowest name, the tyrant of an hour, And her best empire negligence of pow'r: By yielding she obtains the noblest sway, And reigns securely when she seems t'obey. EUPHELIA. With double grace she pleads Discretion's cause, Who from her life her virtuous lesson draws. URANIA. As some fair violet, loveliest of the glade, Sheds its mild fragrance on the lonely shade, Withdraws its modest head from public sight, Nor courts the Sun, nor seeks the glare of light; Should some rude hand profanely dare intrude, And bear its beauties from its native wood, Expos'd abroad its languid colours fly, Its form decays, and all its odours die; So Woman, born to dignify retreat, Unknown to flourish, and unseen be great, To give domestic life its sweetest charm, With softness polish, and with virtue warm, Fearful of Fame, unwilling to be known, Should seek but Heav'n's applauses, and her own; Should dread no blame but that which crimes impart, The censures of a self-condemning heart. Heav'n's minist'ring Angel! she should seek the cell Where modest want and silent anguish dwell; Raise the weak head, sustain the feeble knees, Cheer the cold heart, and chace the dire disease. The splendid deeds which only seek a name, Are paid their just reward in present fame; But know, the awful all-disclosing day, The long arrear of secret worth shall pay; Applauding Saints shall hear with fond regard, And He, who witness'd here, shall there reward. CLEORA. Let's join to bless that Pow'r who brought us here, Adore his goodness, and his will revere; Assur'd, that Peace exists but in the mind, And Piety alone that Peace can find. URANIA. In its true light this transient Life regard: This is a state of trial, not reward. Tho' rough the passage, peaceful is the port, The bliss is perfect, the probation short. Of human wit beware the fatal pride: An useful follower, but a dang'rous guide: On holy Faith's aspiring pinions rise; Assert your birth-right, and assume the skies. FOUNTAIN OF BEING! teach us to devote To Thee each purpose, action, word, and thought! Thy grace our hope, thy love our only boast, Be all distinctions in the Christian lost! Be this in ev'ry state our wish alone, Almighty, Wise, and Good, Thy will be done!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ODE TO CHARITY. [To be performed by the Characters of the Piece.] I. O CHARITY, divinely wise, Thou meek-ey'd Daughter of the skies! From the pure fountain of eternal light, Where fair, immutable, and ever bright, The Beatific Vision shines, And Angel with Archangel joins In choral songs to sing his praise, Parent of Life, Ancient of Days, Who was ere Time existed, and shall be Thro' the wide round of vast Eternity, Oh come, thy warm benevolence impart, Enlarge my feelings, and expand my heart! II. O Thou, enthron'd in realms above, Bright effluence of that boundless love Whence joy and peace in streams unsully'd flow, Oh deign to make thy lov'd abode below! Tho' sweeter strains adorn'd my tongue Than Saint conceiv'd or Seraph sung, And tho' my glowing fancy caught Whatever Art or Nature taught, Yet if this hard unfeeling heart of mine Ne'er felt thy force, O Charity divine, An empty shadow Science would be found: My knowledge ignorance, my wit a sound! III. Tho' my prophetic spirit knew To bring futurity to view, Without thy aid e'en this would nought avail, For Tongues shall cease, and Prophecies shall fail. Come then, thou sweet celestial guest, Shed thy soft influence o'er my breast, Bring with thee Faith, divinely bright, And Hope, fair harbinger of light, To clear each mist with their pervading ray, To fit my soul for Heav'n, and point the way Where Perfect Happiness her sway maintains; For there the God of Peace for ever reigns.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. [Spoken by two young Ladies.] Enter First Lady. LADIES, to-night our unexperienc'd train Your favour courted:âDid we court in vain? Like Hamlet's Ghost just rising from the dead, âWith all our imperfections on our head,â Unlectur'd in the deep theatric art, To rouse the feelings of the pitying heart; Unus'd to acting, and untaught to feign The fancy'd pleasure, and the mimic pain, You'll wonder how we ventur'd into viewâ And to say truth, I wonder at it too! Yet think not, fill'd with insolence we come; Conscious, demerit still would keep us dumb. Enter Second Lady. Child, we must quit these visionary scenes, And end our follies when we end our teens: These bagatelles we must relinquish now, And good matronic gentlewomen grow. Fancy no more on airy wings shail rise; We now must scold the maids, and make the pies. Verse is a folly: we must get above it; And yet I know not how it isâI love it. Tho', should we still the rhyming trade pursue, The men will shun usâand the women too. The men, poor souls! of scholars are afraid; We shou'd not, did they govern, learn to read; At least, in no abstruser volume look Than the learn'd recordsâof a Cook'ry-book. The ladies too, their well-meant censure give: âWhat! does she write? A slattern, as I live.â âI wish she'd leave her books, and mend her clothes: âI thank my stars I know not verse from prose. âHow well soe'er these learned ladies write, âThey seldom act the virtues they recite; âNo useful qualities adorn their lives: âThey make sad Mothers, and still sadder Wives.â First Lady. I grant this satire just, in former days, When Sapphos and Corinnas tun'd their lays; But in our chaster times 'tis no offence, When female virtue joins with female sense; When moral Carter breathes the strain divine, And Aikin's life flows faultless, as her line; When all-accomplish'd Montague can spread Fresh gather'd laurels round her Shakespeare's head. Thus far, to clear her from the sin of rhyme, Our Author bade me trespass on your time, To shew, that if she dares aspire to letters, She only sins in common with her betters. She bids me addâtho' Learning's cause I plead, One virtuous sentiment, one gen'rous deed, Affords more genuine transport to the heart Than genius, wit, or science can impart; For these shall flourish, fearless of decay, When wit shall fail, and science fade away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INSCRIPTION In a beautiful Retreat, called Fairy Bower. AIRY spirits, you who love Cooling bow'r, or shady grove, Streams that murmur as they flow, Zephyrs bland that softly blow; Babbling Echo, or the tale Of the love-lorn Nightingale; Hither, airy spirits, come, This is your peculiar home. If you love a verdant glade, If you love a noon-tide shade, Hither, Sylphs and Fairies, fiy, Unobserv'd of earthly eye. Come, and wander ev'ry night By the moon-beam's glimm'ring light, And again at early day Brush the silver dews away. Mark where first the daisies blow, Where the bluest violets grow, Where the sweetest linnet sings, Where the earliest cowslip springs: Where the largest acorn lies, Precious in a Fairy's eyes: Sylphs, tho' unconfin'd to place, Love to fill an acorn's space. Come, and mark within what bush Builds the blackbird or the thrush, Great his joy who first espies; Greater his who spares the prize. Come, and watch the hallow'd bow'r, Chace the insect from the flow'r; Little offices like these, Gentle souls and Fairies please. Mortals! form'd of grosser clay, From our haunts keep far away; Or, if you should dare appear, See that you from vice are clear. Folly's minion, Fashion's fool, Mad Ambition's restless tool! Slave of Passion, slave of Pow'r, Fly, ah! fly this tranquil bow'r! Son of Av'rice, soul of frost, Wretch,âof Heav'n abhorr'd the most, Learn to pity others wants, Or avoid these hallow'd haunts. Eye unconscious of a tear, When Affliction's train appear, Heart that never heav'd a sigh For another, come not nigh. But, ye darling Sons of Heav'n, Giving freely what was giv'n, Who, like Providence, dispense The blessings of benevolence; You who wipe the tearful eye, You who stop the rising sigh, You who well have understood The luxury of doing good, Come, ye happy virtuous few, Open is my bow'r to you; You these mossy banks may press; You each guardian Fay shall bless.
