      <field name="fulltext">THE AFRICANS; OR, WAR, LOVE, AND DUTY. A PLAY, In Three Acts, To which are added, A DESCRIPTION OF THE COSTUME,âCAST OF THE CHARACTERS. ENTRANCES AND EXITS,âRELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE PERFORMERS ON THE STAGE, AND THE WHOLE OF THE STAGE BUSINESS. EMBELLISHED WITH AN ENGRAVING, From a Drawing taken in the Theatre by Mr. R. Cruikshank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REMARKS. The Africans. 'Tis an humiliating truth that the nobler virtues are more practised among barbarian tribes than by civilised society;âthat the savage heathen, who wages war to extermination and devours his captives, not unfrequently displays a glorious self-denial, a sublime magnanimity that, with true believers, pass for fable and romance. Mr. Colman lays his scene in an African town; his principal characters are three sable brothers, who exhibit those cardinal virtues, filial duty and affection, in a degree that might startle the polished European. His black Mandingo majesty, who lights up his faggots with Roman Catholic fury, is an honourable exception to the general run of pale-faced potentates; nor would his ebony holiness Farulho suffer in comparison with the full-blown pluralist in canonicals. Selico is to marry Berissa, the daughter of the priest. His brother Torribal, a wicked wit, rallies the bridegroom on his wedding-day, and accuses him of want of duty to their widowed mother, in quitting her roof. But Madiboo, a mahogany harum-scarum and purveyor of eatables to the Day and Martin family, takes the part of Selico, and pays back the sable satirist in his own coin. As the day advances, the jollity becomes more uproariousâthe tang-tang thumps; the big tabala beats; bells, flutes, and simbings; shrieks, shouts, and such-like incongruous music swell the nuptial chorusâwhen, suddenly, an alarm is given that the Mandingo warriors are pouring down in miriads: loud yells are heard; fires are seen raging on all sides; the marriage ceremony is suspended; the town of Fatteconda is surprised, sacked, and burned to the ground! Pondering on the wide-spread desolation, like Marius amidst the ruins of Carthage, Selico indulges in bitter recollections of the past, and mournful anticipations of the future. His betrothed bride and her father are both slain; his aged mother and brothers, if they yet survive, are either made captives, or fled he knows noth whither. He is faint with hunger, and lays down to die. At this moment, a well-known voice salutes himâ'its Madiboo's: he receives the joyful intelligence that his parent, borne by her faithful children to the woods, has not perished. Thither he is supported by his affectionate, madcap brother, with famine stamped upon his brow, and despair withering his heart. The miserable family are pinched by famine, and surrounded on all sides by hordes of revengeful barbarians. News transpires that the Mandingos have invited the English merchants to buy their prisoners. Torribal had charged his brother Selico with want of filial affectionâ now he will prove if the charge be true! 'Tis proposed to draw lots which of them shall sell himself for a slave. To this Selico objectsâhis lot is cast already, more unhappy he cannot be; his early hope is goneâto him the world's sweet garden is a lonely desert. The biddings of those respectable christians, Messrs. Grim, Marrowbone, Flayall, and Adamant, are anything but liberal. The market for human bones and sinews is by no means briskâan able-bodied black is hardly worth the price of a fat bullock; and Captain Abraham Adamant, whom the cruel negroes chucked down the hatchways for stowing only fifteen of them in a hammock in hot weather! bids a sum for the self-devoted savage, barely sufficient to support his wretched mother through the winter. A reward of four hundred ounces of gold is offered for the apprehension of a man who had escaped through the musquettry of his Mandingo majesty's Spanish-liquorice body guards, from the tent of his favourite female prisoner. Selico resolves to give himself up as the criminal! and his brother Madiboo is to claim the reward! Nor can Madiboo's pathetic eloquence dissuade him from his purpose. They appear before the kingâthe accuser weeps on his brother's breast, and is speechless with agony: the self-accused plays his part nobly,âacknowledges his guilt: the reward is given to the supposed betrayer of his friend, and Selico is borne off to an immediate and cruel death. A victim is to suffer with himâthe female prisoner, from whose tent the muffled stranger escaped. Two piles of faggots are heaped up; the executioners, with their flaming brands and instruments of torture, are ready to assist at the ceremony; and his majesty and his court are assembled to see terrible justice done upon the delinquents. The female prisoner is led forth; her veil is thrown aside, and she breathes a prayer of resignationâ'tis Berissa! The lovers rush into each others arms; and Berissa solemnly declares that her fellow-sufferer is not the guilty one. But torments shall not wrest from her the real culprit.â The drum rolls, and the ghastly ministers of death lift high their blazing torches to fire the funeral piles; when Farulho rushes in, prostrates himself before the king, and pleads the circumstance of a fond father striving to rescue his betrothed daughter from the embraces of a foe. The royal heart feels a touch of pity; and when the mother of the three noble sons enters the imperial presence, and tells her melancholy tale, it melts in right earnest. He commands a dowry of two thousand crowns to be given to the affianced bride, and unites her to Selico. But where is the wood and ivory-turner, âHis black Mandigo majesty's white minister of state,â Mr. Henry Augustus Mug, of No. 25, Snow-Hill? Good luck to the nigger-slave merchant that kidnapped and sold this frolicksome piece of human mutton to a dealer at Fatteconda! where he jested himself into the cabinet as prime minister and buffoon; legislator and ladies man; principal plenipo of the black petticoats, and privy seal; with the run of the imperial kitchen, palace, palanquins, and pretty girls, (Ã¡-la-mode d'Angletterre!) free gratis and for nothing! This comic episode to a tagic drama plays his part with infinite good fun and good feeling; and was originally represented by Liston with all his broad-faced humour and grotesque gravity. His âWon't you come, Mr. Mug?â was chanted from one end of Great Britain to the other; and âMugâ became a cognomen for any cockney Adonis whose constitution and countenance were uncommonly concupiscent and charming. This play was received with very great applauseâand deservedly; for Mr. Colman again put his axe to the root of the Upas Tree of Slavery; which, to the honour of British humanity, is now grubbed up and laid prostrate for ever!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âThe Town of Fatteconda, in Bondou, a district of Africa, inhabited by the Foulahs, and situate between the rivers Senegal and Gambiaâa large tract of romantic Country beyond the townâa Hut, L. S. E.â The horizon is very faintly tinged with the rays of the sun, which grow stronger till the sun is completely risen. Selico discovered leaning against a tree, R. Sel. Rise, orb of light!âthose streaks, thy harbingers, Are sluggish glowworms on the mountain's brow;â Thy bird, the eagle, mourns; and constant dawn, Whom thou wert wont to press with hasty fire, Weeps dew, in token of thy love's neglect, Thou follow'st her so slow.âThough oft, ere noon, Faint from thy influence I seek the shade, Come sun, and scorch me now!âdart thy full beams O'er Afric's sands upon me!âbring me day! Bring me to my Berissaâto my bride! [Torribal puts his head through an aperture in the hut, L. S. E. Tor. Selico! Sel. Ha, Torribal! what say you? Tor. That the sun don't rise sooner for your bawling,â But I do!âso I'll come and speak to you. He disappears. Sel. Close to a brake, I've seen a playful lion Pawing his fellow whelp;â'tis rough diversion, Much like my brother's wit. Well, he loves meâ We're brother lions, but I the tamest! Enter Torribal, from the hut, L. S. E. Tor. Now, Selico, my younger brother!âSoon They'll beat the tabala, to tell us all That you will soon be married. Sel. Ay, ay, With the consent of our loved mother, And with the sanction of our good priest Farulho, father of my bride Berissa. Pr'ythee, what then? Tor. Why, then, 'tis to be hoped You won't for sun-beams hunt so soon to-morrow As to-day, lest your sweet bride should sour. Sel. Still, brother, you will mock. Tor. Mock!âOh, not I!â Love is a pretty pastime;âand last night, 'Neath the tabba tree, in our market place, Did I harangue the people on your nuptials. Sel. 'Twas kind. What said you? Tor. Africans! said I,â Townsmen of Fatteconda, here in Bondou, Between the Senegal and Gambia, We Foulahs are the prettiest of the negroesâ The same sun that dyes our neighbours black, Feloops, Mandingoes, Jaloops, and the rest, Hath tinged us Foulahs lighter by ten shades. Berissa is the prettiest maid amongst us; My brothers are the prettiest of our tribe; And brother Selicoâexcept myselfâ The handsomest of all our family. So pray this loving couple's love may last A little longer than my wedding-speech. [Crosses to R. Sel. A speech of scoff and ribaldry!âmy heart Grieves that it cannot thank you. Side by side, When first I followed you into the wars, (A stripling I, you season'd in the fight) Remember, Torribalâ Tor. That you fought well. Sel. No, no, not that,âbut that you saved my life. You saw the arrow coming, and your arm, Guarding my breast, received it.âIn your flesh It quiver'd, and ne'er scarr'd the youth you clasped.â You wrenched the barb, reeking from your sinews, And, smiling, you exclaimed, âThey must not wound My little brother Selico!â Tor. Umph!âDid I? Sel. Yes, Torribal: you may forget, I cannot. But pr'ythee think, good brother, though thy hand Taking Torribal's hand. So fondly screen'd my bosom, your tongue May deeplyâvery deeply, wound my heart. Tor. I hate all honey-mouthâall flattery! Young men may marry; there's no harm in that. What's one wife? our laws allows us plenty. But, to desert a motherâ Sel. What? desert! You touch me to the quick! the very wolf Feels there the tie of nature! Our mother Rejoices in myâProphet Mahomet! Whom Afric's converts worship!âwho shall say I leave a mother in the hour of need? Could I, whoâ Madiboo is seen crossing in the distance, from L. to R., winding round a pathway on a hill, and singing, till he is hid by the intervening bushes. Kouskous and sinkatoo, for king Ali Beg, oh! But Serawooli king he eat antelope's leg, oh! Sing shannawang, sing sharrawang, Sing shongo! Tor. Over the hills comes Madiboo, our brother: He went before the moon sunk to fetch home Provision by the dawn. Sel. He will not say, While you and he remain, and I at hand, I left a mother destitute. Tor. Not he!â He never thinksâmad-pates have no morrow. His scull holds just enough to oil his limbs, And make him active. Then he runs a field, Shoots paroquets, and snares the red-legg'd partridge; Hastes back, incumber'd with more game than brains, And so we go to dinner. Sel. Still unjust. His frame, robust and pliant, boasts a nature Well suited to it, for 'tis bold yet yieldingâ Fierce to his foe as panther's. But the dove, Who wings her anxious journey home with food, Returns not to her young with more delight, Than he comes laden to his family. The strong, but generous sovereign of the woods, And the spring lamb that frolics on the green, Have mingled both their qualities in him. Tor. Enough. Sel. Not quite.âThey who have brains enough To prompt them honestly to use their limbs, And work a living for their humble homes, Are neither fools nor burthens in a nation. Enter Madiboo, singing, carrying corn and game, R. Good wife had Kickawick,âshe drowny one night, oh! But Kickawick no fish again, for fear him wife bite, oh! Sing shannawang, &amp;c. Mad. [Putting down the different articles near the door.] There's maize,âI'll throw it into the paloon And pound it for my mother's kouskous pudding,â And there are partridges; ground nuts, and rice; And three fat guinea fowls.âI shot them, Selico, For your bride's father. Tor. (R.) [Sneeringly.] Ay, priests love good eating. Mad. (C.) Bless all their jolly chops! I love to seeâ When there's a wedding dinnerâthe good old man, Who joined the couple, smiling at the feast. Tor. Well, let them gorge. Sel. (L.) [Warmly.] Farulho is no glutton. Mad. [Looking at his brother.] A glutton!âOh! I seeâthe old work! You have been fretting him about Berissaâ And on the wedding-day, too, Torribal! Come, come, this is not kind. Tor. [Sulkily.] It all began In a good joke. Mad. [Laughing.] Then you did not begin it. You are, 'tis certain, as incapable Of a good joke, as an owl is of singing. Tor. Why, how now, Madiboo!âyou bird-catcher! Hunt and be dumb! your wit lies in your heels. Mad. And where lies yours? Your muddy jibes are like The frisking of an elephant,âyou trample, And fancy you have caper'd! I have mark'd you, A thousand times, tormenting Selicoâ Dashing your gallâwhich you call pleasantryâ Upon his milky spirit, 'till his heart Has ached with pain, and mine has boil'd with anger! Tor. I tell you, fool, I jested. Mad. Jested, did you? Why, you are grown, of late, as bright as leadâ As comical as malice! and cut as keen As any rusty hatchet, notched! [Pointing to Selico. Shame on it, Torribal! see how he grieves! You jeer a brother as the Moorish chief Treated a neighbour at a merry-making: He cried, âI'll tickle you!â and chopp'd his head off. Sel. [Crossing to C., stepping between them, and taking their hands.] Peace, I entreat you! pray let us be friends! We outrage, else, our parent's tenderness; Who, left in widow'd poverty, wept o'er us; Toil'd in her sickness, fasting while we fed, And clung to life, only to rear her babes! When brothers are at variance, could they think On the fond tear a mother shed on them, That woke their slumbers while their infant arms Circled each other's neck, 'twould surely quench All sparks of strife within their breasts for ever. Mad. [Affected.] My sparks are all gone out; [To Torribal.] and, goodman Gruff, When you're extinguish'd, say so, and be friends. Tor. [Crossing, and holding out his hand.] There then! Mad. [Shaking it.] And there! Sel. That's as it should be. Darina. [Calling without, L. Selico! Mad. Our mother calls youârun! Sel. I come, good mother. [Exit into the hut, L. S. E. Tor. He talks it well. Mad. Who?âhe? Tor. Ay, Selico. But if he bears us all such loads of love, Why does he quit us? Mad. Why?âto take a wife. Tor. Ay, the priest's daughter; she is rich and grand,â Else why not bring her to our little family? Mad. Because, 'tis like, she'll have a little family; And then, in time, the cabin would not hold us. Tor. This mother, whom we work for now she's oldâ Mad. [Emphatically.] Ay, and who work'd for us when she was young! Tor. Well,âher he leaves, and goesâ Mad. A stone's throw off;â How barbarous! [Pointing off, L.] There stands the house he'll live in! He'll not be able, now, to visit her Above ten times a-day. Tor. Well, well,âhis labour Falls on us now; and added to our ownâ Mad. We shall be kill'd; we're both such puny children! Tor. Psha! If 'tis right to-marry, then how comes it He marries first? Mad. Oh! are you thereabouts? Now it comes out you want a wife yourself,â You would be billing, would you?âoh, you sly one! Tor. Not I!âbut he's the youngestâ Mad. That's the reason! Girls always like the youngest best, that's certain. Tor. As things fall outâ Mad. Come, come, don't you fall out, When things fall out just as we might expect them. I shoot, you till the garden, for our mother. To gain a daily blessing for her, Selico Has paid a daily visit to our priest. Tor. Well? Mad. When your corn and vegetables sprout, Do pretty girls sprout with them? Tor. No, not one. Mad. And when I've been upon the hunt for birds, I never once put a priest's daughter up! But Selico went in the way of beauty; And she, whom he soon loved, loved him. What said Her fatherâgood old soul!âthe priest Farulho? Just thisââThe filial heart of Selico Bespeaks him good, and he shall have my girl. An honest husband is a wife's best wealth. A rich wife helps a poor and kindly son To cheer an aged widow and a mother.â When every match is made upon this plan, Family quarrels won't be quite so common. Tor. Perhaps I've been too bitter. Mad. Worse than wormwood. We want no home disturbers of the wedding; Others may come, thatâ Tor. Others! Mad. Yes;âbut first swear not to blab. Tor. I promise. Mad. Your promise Is so unlike your joke, that I can take it. Listen, then!âThe Mandingo king, 'tis thought, Will take us by surprise. Tor. The usual way of war, among our nations. Mad. Coming home, I saw among the thickets A party of Mandingoes, arm'd in ambush. Tor. The army's then at hand. [Going, R.] I'll raise our people! Mad. [Catching him by the arm.] As sure as you attempt to raise the people, I take you by surprise, and trip your heels up. You'll mar the wedding! Tor. Yes, but are you mad? Mad. Be calm! 'twas but a straggling party. We have time, Before the main force comes, to give alarm, So let us have the marriage over. Tor. But ifâ Mad. Nay, be ruled; the very moment Our brother has secured his bride, we'll rouse The town. Tor. Agreed. Mad. The time will be but short; And thenâHush! here's our mother; not a word! Enter Darina, from the hut, L. S. E., with a mantle an her arm. Tor. &amp; Mad. Bless our dear mother! Dar. Blessings on my children! On this day double blessings! for it brings Joy to my youngest born; and, therefore, joy To both his brothers. Oh! the drops that now Steal on my cheek are sweet as morning gems; For my heart's sunshine sparkles in my eye, And grateful is the dew that glitters there. Mad. Come, 'tis full time that we should to the priest; The bride will grow impatient. Dar. I shall follow; And, as our custom is, the marriage over, We'll join you at the feast. Mad. Good. Brother Torribal, do you go with us? [While Darina is unfolding the mantle, Madiboo whispers Torribal. Don't!âRemain at home to guard our mother. If any of the stragglers come to skirmish, Fight like a devil till I come to back you. Tor. [Apart to Madiboo.] Enough! [Aloud.] Away, Madiboo! I shall stop To stow in the provisions you have brought;â Then, mother, you and I can go together. [He takes up the articles that Madiboo had put down, and exits into the hut, L. S. E. Re-enter Selico, from the hut, L. S. E. Sel. Now, mother, once more bless me, and I go. Dar. Stay, Selico; present this to Farulho. Mad. A curious mantle that. Dar. [Giving it to Selico.] The widow's offering, On her son's marriage, to the good old priest. Say, while she work'd it, many and many a prayer Of gratitude, burst from Darina's lips, For him who thus has bless'd her and her son. Sel. Embrace me, mother; and our prophet guard you! [They embrace. Mad. [Aside.] My mind misgives me;âshould the foe arrive Before weâhum! [Aloud.] Now, good mother, farewell! You'll come to dinner? Der. Yes,âto find all happy. Mad. Ay, to be sure! The priest will have his game, And that will make him happy; Selico Will have Berissa, that will make them happy; And Torribal stays here to come with you, So you two will be happy.âOh, there never Were such a set of happy, happy people, As we shall be to-day, in Africa! Come, Selico! come! Farewell, good mother! [Exeunt, Madiboo and Selico R., Darina into the hut, L. S. E. SCENE II. âThe Interior of Farulho's House. Enter Henry Augustus Mug, R. Mug. Oh, nature! since you form'd me amorous, why did fortune cast me on a soil, where to be fair is to be ugly? Oh, Henry Augustus Mug! once a turner, both in wood and ivory, and free of the city of London; you are now a slave, among the living ebony ware of the world's creation. The chief folks, indeed, of Fatteconda, the Foulahs as they call themselves, are some shades lighter than the original natives, and my fellow-slaves; but the town altogether looks like a back-gammon board, when the game is over, and all the black and yellow men are jumbled together.â Still that little jade, Sutta, runs in my head strangely!â She's a dingy Venus, of the dumpling sort, sprung out of the Black sea. [Looking off, L.] Eh! here she comes! Enter Sutta, L., and crosses to R. Mug. (C.) Sutta! Sutta! Sutta. Ah, massa Mug! me go get sweet scent for bride,âgood missy Berissa. Mug. [Taking her hand.] But I want to talk with you. Oh, Sutta! if I had you with me in my own country, I could make you so happy! Sutta. Where you live, when you at home? Mug. Upon Snow-HillâMug and Co., goods for exportation. Little did I think, when I exported myself, to buy a cargo of elephant's and hippopotamus's teeth, on the banks of the Gambia, that I should be kidnapp'd by a negro slave merchant, and carried up the country to be sold. Sutta. How much you sell for? Mug. D?n the price! it mortifies me! On account of my colour, I didn't fetch more than an English sand-man would give for a good donkey. Sutta. What dat?âDonkey very poor white man? Mug. Oh, no; we have many fine gentlemen of the donkey breed in London, with more money than they know what to do with. But, after pawing me about in the market, as a butcher handles a sheep, all this handsome human mutton, that now stands before you, was sold for five minkallis; value, not quite two pounds ten shillings sterling. Sutta. Farulho good priest, he kind to poor slave. Mug. He's a very sympathetic savage. But, ah, Sutta! should you ever go with me to Snow-Hill, what pretty things I would turn for you! Sutta. Wish you turn ugly thing for me, now. Mug. How? Sutta. Turn your face t'other way, massa Mug;â 'cause, when you look me full, it make me jump. Mug. Jump! what for? Sutta. Skin like toothâwhite all over. Mug. [Aside.] If this girl got over Blackfriars-Bridge into the city, she'd refuse the hand of the lord-mayor, to marry a chimney-sweeper. [To Sutta.] So, you object to my complexion? [Sutta nods.] And my features, too, perhaps. Sutta. No; pity you not blackâfor your features look like negro man, very. Mug. D?m me, if the best looking Londoner mustn't be smokedried, like king Charles at Charing Cross, before he has any chance in this country! Why, I tell you, as I told you over and over again, white is the handsomest. Sutta. Ah! black for me. DUET.âSutta and Mug. Sutta. Oh, the jet feather'd raven, how lovely it look, ah! When he spread him black wing to fly over the brook, ah! Ulacol! ulacol! Mug. Oh, the white swan he swims in the Thames mighty smugly, But he hides his black legs 'cause they look so d?d ugly. Fol de rol! fol de rol! Sutta. Young negro girl skin make her eye to shine out, ah! And sparkle like night star, when bats flit about, ah! Ulalown! ulalown! Mug. A white woman's eye, through her eyelashes darting, Makes black ladies' eyes âAll my eye, Betty Martin.â Derry down! Sutta. But I be AfricâI be Afric: Blacky man he be my delight, ah! Mug. And I'm a CockneyâI'm a Cockney: I love black when I can't get white, ah! Sutta. Go away, white manâwhite man, go! Then me sing quickaâwickaâwit! Mug. If I had a little black girl I know Then I'd sing, fal de ral tit! Together. Sutta. Sweet black boy, Love, me bend before you! Mug. White urchin, Cupid, I adore you! Sutta. Black boy, Love! Mug. White boy, Love! Mug. Still I maintain thatâ[Looking off, R.] Stay! here's our master, the priest Farulho. Enter Farulho, R. Far. Come, Sutta! my Berissa stays for youâ Prepare,âfor Selico will soon be here. Sutta. I go quick, massa! [Exit, L. Far. Our prophet guard you, white man! Mug. Thank you reverence;âbut if nobody else guarded me, I should make bold to give you the slip. Far. Be not so sullen, christian; be not moody On my child's wedding-day: for I obtain'd you From a harsh man, to soften your captivity;â And when I paid your rateâ Mug. Sink the money, if you please; 'tis devillish disagreeable! âI have sold an ivory tooth-pick case out of my show-glass for double the money! Far. Nay, I was not the cause of your inthralment. You were in bondage when I saw you first, And toiling past your strength beneath the lash.â I purchased you to smooth your yoke with down.â I wanted not the white man for my slave, But he could find no friendâyet needed one. Mug. You are the kindest copper-coloured clergyman that ever took tithes of the mussulman negroes. But I shall be as deadly-lively at your jollification, as a shut-up shop on a fast-day. [Wild music heard without, L. Far. Forget your cares awhile; my daughter marriesâ The house cries holiday; jocund mirth floats Down the musky vale, and echo answers it. Each slave to-day shall have a double portion. Mug. That's as much as to say, we are all allow'd to get drunk with dooliâa sort of African Whitbread's Entire. Far. Oh, no! excess befits not me, nor mine; A priestly festival unbends the brow, As cheerful morning lights the sober hills: The drunkard's revel is a heated day, That ends in midnight storm distorting nature. Mug. Pray, did your reverence ever hear of Dolly's Chop-House? Far. I know not what you mean. Mug. You may get a better dinner there for eighteen pence, than all the rich men here could give at a pic-nic. Far. What would you have to make your fare more dainty? Mug. What you have no notion of. A clean table-cloth, and a three prong'd pork, with a neat turn'd ivory handle; a hot beaf-steak, done by a quick fire; with mash'd potatoes, and pickled cabbage; the mustard and pepper-cruets at one elbow, and a pot of porter with a cauliflower head, at the other. Far. You talk of things I do not understand. Mad. And how the devil should you? Lord love your mahogany holiness, how you would stare to see Leaden-hall Market! If once I should get home again, I'd not give up the comforts of an English shopkeeper's dinner, in his back parlour, to be archbishop of Africa! Far. I would you were at home, since thus you pine. Mug. Then why do you keep me here? Far. To rescue you from death. You would be slain, I passing through this country to your own, A strange, lone wanderer. I but detain you, Poor white man, to preserve you. Should there ever Come christian merchants, trading, through this town, To them I would consign you, and unransom'd, That you might journey to your native land. Mug. Why, would youâhonour bright!âDo you promise? Far. I do, as I love truth, and feel compassion. Mug. [Kissing his hand.] Heaven bless you! When we part, we shall never meet again in this world; but though our persuasions are as different as our colour, I think a generous heart on your side, and a grateful one on mine, will bring us together in another. [Wild music without, L. Enter Slaves, singing and dancing, L. DANCE AND CHORUS OF SLAVES. Now the tang-tang thump; big tabala beat; While the flute and the bells make music sweet; And the negro girl on the simbing play, For this be missy's wedding-day. Then calabash we fill, for massa kind, And he let slave play as much as he mind. I too kate boo kou la, &amp;c. So the tang-tang thump, &amp;c. Enter Berissa, R.âThe Slaves bow. Far. Berissa, my loved child!âmy dear Berissa! Ber. Oh, father! too much happiness, I find, Yields aching pleasureâmy flurried spirits Pain me with joyâthus let me kneel and soothe them! [Kneels. This day, (a solemn day for both!) in which The anxious father renders up his child; In which the child doubts whether destiny Has mark'd her marriage voyage for calms or storms;â Oh! on this day, with double zeal, bestow Your priestly benediction! raise me, then, To your fond breast, and add a parent's blessing. Far. Thy priest, child, prays Heaven to protect thee! [Extends his arms over her. Thy father's feelings almost choke his utterance! Come, rise, and let me clasp thee to my bosom! [He raises, and embraces her. Mug. I gave away Miss Griffin, at St. Andrew's church, Holborn, but, hang me! if the white curate moved me so much at the marriage, as this African parson does, giving his daughter a blessing. Far. I trust, my daughter, that you will be happy. Ber. Yes, Selico is good: but I leave you;â I shall not tend you quite as I was wont. Far. Well, well; the elder doves, by nature, know Their callow family in time will fly, And pair with youthful mates in other nests. Ber. Oh, but they fly for ever!âI would not, For all the kings of Africa could give, Wing a far distant flight from you my father. Your bird will hover near her native tree;â And, though she nestles not where she was born, Each day she'll plume, to circle round the spot That gave her birth; rest there to murmur love; Then fly off, and soon renew her visit. Mug. Bless her! she's a dove indeed! If I ever carve pigeon-pies again, I shall never cut up one without thinking of her. Far. All's wellâall must be wellâa parent's eye Has mark'd a bridegroom that I think deserves you. So cheer thee, daughter! Single out a wish Wherein I can indulge you. I would make A wedding present to my child's desires, Our slaves shall be so happy on this day! Ber. [Earnestly seizing his hand.] Slaves happy!âOh, my father! there's my wishâ To make men happy you must make them free! [The Slaves shout. Mug. Huzza, miss! that's an English sentiment: go to London, and parliament will naturalize you directly. [Exit, L. Far. I am a gentle task master; I gall not The man I buy. Is this your bridal boon? Ber. Yes, yes,âyour daughter begs it. Do but think How the slave's heart must sicken for his home! The nightingale's wild carol to the moon, Reminds him of the sweet and mellow notes Once warbled near his cot of liberty. If he's a father, and a prattling child Lisps where he labours, âWhere are now the babes,â He groans, âthat I am torn from?â Mothers captive, Must know still keener anguish. In bondage, Man or woman, doubly feel all kindred ties;â And when they die, Heaven only numbers How many slaves have perish'd by despair! Re-enter Sutta, L. Sutta. Massa Farulho, Selico be now in your tent, out of door. He wait to take you to mosque, missy, and make you nice wife. Far. Come, sweet! though captives chaunt your bridal song, Their burden shall be freedom. They who hear me, Spread through my house, and fields, Farulho's promise, At dawn I will assemble all my slaves, And give them liberty for ever! [The Slaves shout.] [To Berissa.] Come! [Exeunt Farulho and Berissa, L., followed by Slaves, dancing. Sutta. Liberty! oh, dat make my heart go tump tump! When I see my home, how my eye will trickle joy! Ah! priest Farulho dear, good massa!âbut some massa, oh! dey whippy so! SONG.âSutta. Sutta home she fly, now; To her hut she hie, now; Parents tear she dry, now No more to roam: Father, mother, Sister, brother, They will cherish slave come home. Captive when they make us, Joy and hope forsake us; From all dear they take us, Far, far to roam. Then we languish, Toil in anguish, Till slave perish far from home. Massa, kind and tender, Sutta he befriend her; To her hut he send her, No more to roam. Though me grieve now, Him to leave now, Oh! what joy when slave reach home! [Going, R. Enter Madiboo, L. Mad. Well done, Sutta! the blackbird is a cuckoo to you. I should like to jump down your throat, steal your voice and run away with it. Sutta. Madiboo, why you no in tent with Selico, to see dance and joy, before bride go to mosque? Mad. Because I've been with Squabba, the cook, plucking Guinea fowls, till I am half fledged with their feathers. We are to have such a wedding dinner as never was known before in Bondou. Besides kous-kous, honeycombs, yams, watermelons and milk, there will be my birds at one end of the table, and a quarter of an elephant at the other; a broil'd ostrich garnished with ganders, twenty stewed magpies, and an antelope's brisket. Sutta. Dat nice. Mad. Very delicate: we shall all gobble like ducks in a frog pond. Sutta. And to-morrow massa Farulho, he make all him poor slave free. Mad. No! does he? Mahomet prosper him!âbut 'tis no more than his slaves had a right to expect. When a priest shows feeling for his fellow-creatures, he only performs the duty it is his business to preach. So, you'll go home, Sutta; andâI suppose you have got a sweetheart there. Sutta. [Laughing.] Hee! hee! Mad. Hee! hee! I understand.âIf a woman titters at anything we ask her, she has made up her mind to say Yes, when we put the question again. What made you fall in love with him? was it because he was tall? Sutta. He promise, when dey put me in chain, to be good to father and mother, till Sutta come back; and if they die, he sayâbut when he say dat, me cry so, me hear no more. Mad. Marry him the moment you get home. Good daughters and honest fellows are something scarce, and I wish you a large family together, if 'tis only to keep up the breed.âThough marriages are but blind bargains, at bestâlike the priest's of Kajaago. SONG.âMadiboo. A priest of Kajaago, as blind as a stone, When he took to his bosom a wife, Cried âDeary, I never shall see you, I own, But you'll be the delight of my life.â Then his arm o'er her shoulders he lovingly pass'd, And says he, âmy love, what is this lump?â She faulter'd a littleâbut told him at last, âPlease your holiness, only my hump!â Says the priest, âthen we cannot cohabit, d'ye seeâ Though I tenderly love you, indeed! For I've taken an oath that my children shan't be Of the camel or buffalo breed.â So he married another he fancied would fit: Coming home in sweet conjugal talk, She stopp'd the blind priest, staying, âSit down a bit, For my legs are too bandy to walk.â âBandy legs!â said the priest, âcan't be counted for sins, So sit there as still as a mouse; For Mahomet curse me, if ever your shins Shall waddle you into my house!â Then he turn'd up his eyes, like the white of boil'd eggs, And pray'd thus to Mahomet smack: âGreat prophet, afford me a wife with good legs, And never a hump on her back.â Then the voice of the prophet in thunder was heard, And rumbled thus, over his head: âA handsome young woman, that can't speak a word, Shall bless your blind reverence's bed.â The priest he bow'd low, crying, âMahomet's kind; Of happiness this is the sum! For a handsome young wife likes her old husband blind, And most men like a wife that is dumb!â Re-enter Mug, in a fright, L. Mug. Oh, lord! I am scared out of my seven senses! Mad. What's the matter, whitey? Mug. Matter enough, whitey-brown. The infernal Mandigoes are making a descent upon us with a huge army. Sutta. Den all poor slave Fahulho make free, Mandingo man make slave again. Mad. Are they in the town? Mug. Pop your head out and see. I was just taking a little walk, and ran home again as if the devil was at my heelsâfor they are all in an uproar on the outskirts, where there has been a skirmish already. Mad. [Impetuously.] Did you pass my mother's hut?â is she safe? Mug. [Not attending to Madiboo.] Oh! if I was but turning tee-to-tums now on Snow-Hill? Mad. [Seizing hold of him.] Speak directly! or I'll shake your lily cheeks into sand grains! Mug. Yes, I didâI did pass her hut!âbut, my dear friend with the nankeen chops, you frighten me as much as the enemy does! Mad. [Still holding him.] Is all quiet there? Mug. Still, as the Royal Exchange on a Sunday. Mad. [Shaking him.] What's that?âSpeak, orâ Mug. Why, zounds! all is quiet there; and I wish you would be so, too. Mad. [Releasing him.] Oh! Did you see my brother Torribal? Mug. Yes, rot him! He gave me a cursed clout o'the jaws, and called me a coward,âthen bid me go back, and not say a word, but mind my business at the wedding. Mad. [Aside.] Then they are only skirmishers yet.â Were there any real peril, Torribal would have sent me word. [Ruminating.] Let me once see the marriage over, and thenâ Mug. Oh, dear! we shall have no quarter! I am afraid the patent-blacking generals don't fight half so genteelly as the ivory commanders. Sutta. Cheer up, massa Mug! Mandingo men dey no hurt you. Mug. No!âWhy do you think so? Sutta. When enemy see you, you fright dem so, dey all run away. Mug. Pray, Mr. Madiboo, if I may make so bold, don't you think we are in a confounded deal of danger? Mad. [Assuming ease.] No, none at all. Mug. I am rejoiced to hear it. What, then, these Mandingo gentlemen of the military, areâ Mad. Psha!âmere nothings. Don't you be a fool, now, and give an alarm about it, among the merry-makers, in the tent. If you do, you villain, I'll be the death of you! Mug. I'm dumb; you have such an amiable way of swearing a man to secrecy, there's no resisting you. Mad. Pooh! I tell you these little brushes are common in our country. Mug. And don't your little brushes sweep a great many off? Mad. Nothing to fear,âthey happen every day. Don't they, Sutta? Sutta. Great many fight since Sutta been here. Mad. Ay, and here we are still; all safe and sound.â [Aside.] Between my mother's safety, and the wedding, I hardly know which way to turn. [Aloud.] I'll just go round the town, and you'll see how soon I shall be back to say all's well. TRIO.âMadiboo, Sutta, and Mug. Mad. All's well! all's well! Yes, I'm sure that all's well. Mug. That's rather more than you can tell. Sutta. Sutta hope that all's well. Mad. Fatteconda's a town that is ancient and strong; Its inhabitants staunch, and have lived in it long, And many a contest have weather'd. Mug. Be the gentry assured, of this old corporation, It would give me most sensible mortification, To see the dark freeholders leather'd. Sutta. Madiboo soon come and tell Mandingo gone, and all well. All well! all well! Madiboo soon come and tellâ Together. Mad. Yes, I'll soon come back and tell That they are gone and all's well. Mug. I hope you'll soon be back to tell That they are gone and all's well. Sutta. There lived an old chief, in war he grew gray, Oh, to his men in battle he said, âSee how many ball it whiz out of the way, And how many arrows fly over the head.â Mad. Ay, ay, no fear. Mug. Still I wish I was not here. Mad. No, fear, Sutta! all well! Together. Sutta. Madiboo soon come and tell. Mad. Yes, I'll soon come back and tell. Mug. I hope you'll soon come back and tell. [Exeunt, Madiboo L., Mug and Sutta, R. SCENE III. âThe Interior of Farulho's Tent, adjoining his House. Farulho, Selico, and Berissa, discovered, attended by Domestics and Slaves.âThe Slaves shout. Far. Nay, be less clamorous; for we have yet The sacred ceremony to perform, That is to make us joyful. But I yield To custom; and, ere we proceed to mosque, The bridal dance shall have its due observance Sel. Then strike upon the string; and, as your feet Mark the light maze of fancy on the ground, Be every motion swift as my heart's pulse, That throbs to make my loved Berissa mine! A NEGRO BRIDAL DANCE. [The Dance is interrupted by a discharge of muskets, shrieks, and shouts, withoutâthey all run over to R., in consternation. Enter Madiboo, R. U. E., rushing forward, C., in the utmost agitation. Mad. To arms, directly!âPlace the women in safety!â Break off the marriage! Sel. [Hurriedly.] Break off the marriage! Ber. What's our danger? Far. [Eagerly.] Speak! Mad. I have so much to say, and so little breath toâ The enemy is pouring down in torrents! Sel. A straggling party,âas it often happens. Mad. I hoped so at first, myself; then I had my doubts; then I smothered my apprehensions; thenâOh, Selicoâ dear brother! I had so fixed my hopes on this day ending happy, thatâbut 'tis too late to conceal anything now. Their whole army is in the midst of the town; neither age nor sex is spared;âat this moment, they are even trampling upon infants, and half our houses are in flames! Ber. Oh, Selico! Sel. Be firm, sweetâpray, be firm! While I have life, I will not leave you! Mad. But you must! Sel. What, leave my love in danger! Mad. Think, thinkâwe have a mother!âa helpless aged mother that gave us life, and whose life it is our first duty to preserve. Ber. True; fly to her, Selicoâfly quickly! Sel. Oh! how my separate duties tear me. Far. They should not, Selico; for nature points Your path to action. I have slaves and servants, To guard me and my child; and I have moreâ The temple of our prophet,âsure they cannot Profane the house of prayer: there will I Haste with Berissa.âNay, we have no time For council now. [Crash, discharge of muskets, and shouts, without. Mad. [Taking Selico by the arm.] Come! we shall be too late. Sel. [With great emotion.] It must be so! [Embracing Berissa.] Oh, my love! this struggle!â Farewell!âI trust we soon shall meet again! Oh, guard her, Farulho! Mad. [Tearing him from Berissa.] Away! Sel. &amp; Ber. Farewell! [Exeunt, Selico and Madiboo R., Farulho, Berissa, and Slaves, L.âShouts, yells, and crash without. Enter Mug, R. U. E. Mug. Mercy on me! I would give all the goods in my shop to be up to my neck in an English horse-pond! I declined being a sharp-shooter, because the Tower-guns, on a birth-day, gave me the colic; and now I have run my unhappy head into an African town, that's invaded by an emperor as black as the kitchen chimney of the London Tavern. [Shouts and crash, without.] Here they comeâ but where shall I go? Oh, Henry Augustus Mug! what will become of you? [Runs off, R. U. E.âShouts without. Enter Mandingoes, R. and L., yelling and brandishing firebrands âthey tear down the tent, and apply the firebrands to itâwhen it is demolished, the town of Fatteconda is seen in flames. A Mandingo Chief and Warriors discovered at the backâthey rush forward, and join the other Warriors with wild exultation. CHORUS OF WARRIORS. Rearârear the torch! to victory proceeding! Mandingo men are stout, and conquer all. Oh! never heed your victims bleedingâ Rush onâand every foe must fall! Rush on! END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âThe Town of Fatteconda, in ruins. Selico discovered, wandering distractedly from L. to R., over the fragments of demolished dwellings, with the mantle of Farulho in his hand. Sel. Monsters of blood! I have borne allâyes, all Without a groan, till now. They've murder'd her! I'll fly to the foe's camp!âI'll do some deed Shall strike them all with terror! Oh, my love! Art thou then gone for ever! By our prophet! I will have such revengeâ[Stumbles.] Fatigue and hunger Have made me faint. [Sinks on the ground, R. Enter Madiboo, among the ruins, L. U. E. Mad. [Calling.] Ho! Selico!âbrother! [Seeing Selico, and running forward, L. Now, Mahomet be praised! at last I've found you. Where have you been these five days, Selico? Sel. Plucking out arrows from the lifeless hearts That lately throbb'd in our companions' bosoms; Turning the faces of dead friends from earth, Then pondering upon their ghastly lips Which, ere the last moon waned, smiled sweetly on us. Mad. Fie! this is weekness, Selico: we want you To help us for our mother. Sel. [Wildly.] Have I one? Mad. Have you? Why, Torribal, and you, and I, Bore her, upon our arms, into the woods, On the same day that they besieged the town: And after that you left us. But she livesâ Sel. Well, 'tis some comfort,âshe's lives. Ha, ha! I have still a motherâyes, she still lives! I saw her placed in safety, ere I went, And both my brothers with her. Mad. Rise, and collect yourself. I have skulk'd here, To find, if possible, a little food Left in the village; and to seek out you. Sel. You have gain'd one point, if not the otherâ You have found me. Mad. Not quite as I could wish; We need you to assist us, and you seem Scarce able to assist yourself. Our motherâ Sel. [Springing from the ground.] I'll fight for her while I've breath within me! Mad. Fight for a dinner, then, and win the battle! Our implements of husbandry, the gun, Fish-spear, and tackle, bird-snares, hatchet, arrows, All that supported us before the war, Are taken by the enemy: and still Their camp remains so near our lurking-place, (A little from the town) we almost fear To venture out, in search of straggling berries Our hands may pluck for usâwe're famishing! Sel. And nothing to support Darina? Mad. Nothing; This day, nor yesterday. The night before, Food was so scanty, that she would not taste The little we could get,âtill, in her faintness, We forced it on her. Sel. Not taste it!âWhy? Mad. Each felt the other's want before their own. She would not eat, fearing to rob her sons, Nor they because they saw their mother starving. Sel. I'll grapple with the lioness, and tear The fresh kill'd wild goat from her sinewy paws, Ere she who gave me birth shall die by famine! I know the spot we fixed my mother in, I'll fly to succour her. Mad. Be cautious, then. Stragglers, from the Mandingo camp, are prowling All round our pillaged town. Pray, now, take heed, Or you may lose your life. Sel. My life!âOh, brother! I wish that it were gone! [Going, L. Mad. [Catching his arm.] Stay, Selico! You must not leave me thus. I dread to ask What have been your losses in the town? Sel. [Distractedly.] Oh, do not ask me! Mad. Look not so wildlyâ You harrow meâyou wish your life were gone? Sel. I do;âbut fear not for me; I shall ne'er Commit self slaughter: the revered Farulho Taught me religion, and I know my duties. Wretches who kill themselves, when life's a burden, Shrink from their fellow men to brave their Makerâ Too tame to soar above the ills of earth, Too rash to bend to the decrees of Heaven, They fancy impious weakness resolution, Scared into courage, the heroic cowards Grow pusillanimously bold, and forfeit All earthly ties, both human and divine! Mad. Where are Berissa and her father? Sel. [Throwing his arms round Madiboo, and sobbing on his neck.] Dead!âboth dead! Mad. I'll not believe it!âSelicoâ Why, Selico! [Raising him affectionately from his neck.] Come, come, dear brotherârouse! Berissa has but fledâfled with her father To some place of safety. Do not droop, man! Come, pr'ythee do not! Sel. Look upon this mantle! Mad. [Starting.] Wellâwell, our mother wove it for the priest. Sel. I threw it o'er his shoulders in the tent, Just ere I hoped to wed my destin'd bride. Heâwith a smile of soft benevolence Smoothing the furrows in the face of ageâ Vow'd to preserve itâevery day to wear it In token of the wedding and in kindness To my dear mother; yea, that till he died, He ne'er would part with it. Mad. This is nothing. The tumult in the town mightâ Sel. [Interrupting him.] Till to-day, I could not clear the rubbish from the mosque; And there, upon the stepsâ Mad. You found the mantle. Ay, in his flight he dropp'd itâ Sel. No, no, no!â I pluck'd it from his headless corpse! Mad. Oh, brother! Sel. The porch was strew'd with mutilated bodies! Close to the priest, and headless as himself, Lay a female's mangled form, whose fingers Twined in his! Some bridal ornaments, Like the mantle in the haste of pillage, Were scatter'd round!âI have them! Mad. [Shuddering.] Not Berissa's? Sel. My clay-cold love's. Mad. Oh! never tell me so. Sel. Will not nature tell you so, my brother? Beneath the hatchets of their murderers, The father and his child, in life's last struggle, Had pressed each other's hand, and death has clinched them. She was the good man's only tendril. He The aged vine she clasp'dâthe storm was cruel: The grateful shoot embraced the withering trunk, And clung there, till they perish'd both together. Mad. Selico, IâRemember, we are men! We must bear up, andâpsha! I cannot speak! [Weeps. Sel. You are a kind, kind brother! Mad. I trust soâ But there are others, still alive, that love you. There's Torribal, a little rough, but kindly. Then our dear mother. Yours are wringing losses, But you have still some comfort in your family. Sel. More misery, as you describe it, now! A family without a home! a mother, Dying for wantâand sons, in manhood's vigour, Without the means to help her! Mad. The activity Often required to fight off present ill, Serves to efface the memory of the past. We must find methods to support our motherâ Or perish in the search! Go to the wood, You know the winding? Sel. I can trace it. Mad. Go! Leave me a little; I'll soon be with you,â My strength and spirits are not worn as yours. Among the ruins of the town, perchance, I yet may something find to save us all From famishing. Go, brotherâand be careful. Sel. [Faintly.] Assist me to the outskirtsâ Mad. [Supporting him.] You are faint! Sel. I am!â'Tis some time since I tasted food. Mad. Cheerly, now! Tut, man! all will yet be well. Come, Selicoâcome, come! [Exit, supporting Selico, over the ruins, L. U. E. SCENE II. âA Wood. Enter Mug, R., carrying a basket full of eatables. Mug. This is what I call a complete smash. They have as great a rage for knocking down houses in Africa, as they have for building, in London. [Starting.] What's that?âOnly a jackdaw! I'm afraid I'm frighten'd!â Whenever I have caught myself whistling, hang me, if I could tell whether the tune was âGuardian angels now protect me,â or âGo to the devil and shake yourself.â I wouldn't have ventured into this dismal town again, from the camp of my new master, the Mandingo king, but for the hankering after the fate of my old master, the Foulah priest;âand, if I was quite sure little Sutta was deceased, I'd go into short mourning. The poor creatures, here, are all as dead as door-nails!âso to keep myself alive, as it is a good English three miles to the conquering king's camp, who has made me his secretary of state, [Sitting on the ground, and opening the basket.] we men high in office always make sure of some devilish pretty pickings. Enter Madiboo, R. Mad. Selico is safe on his way. Now to get some food, Andâ[Seeing Mug, whose back is turned on him.] Ha! a man!âand eating! Mug. Here's a basket full! If the English secretary for foreign affairs could see me now, wouldn't he say a Mandingo cabinet minister lunches in style! Mad. [Rushing forward, and seizing him.] You mustn't touch a morsel! Mug. [Rising, terrified.] Don't kill me! keep me for a showâyou'll find it worth your while. Mad. Ah! white man, is it you? Mug. Let me look at youâis itâeh?âyes! Lord, Mr. Madiboo! I'm heartily glad to meet you alive, though you almost frightened me to death. You won't hurt your old friend Henry Augustus Mug, the ivory turner? Mad. I can't tell! I am desperate! Mug. Are you? Pray don't put yourself in a passion, Mr. Madibooâit will make you angry. Mad. I must have food! Mug. I was just going to dinner. You have dropped in a little unexpectedly; but I am vastly happy to see you. Pray take a seat upon the ground; and excuse this bad set out, as I didn't expect the honour of your company. Mad. Look you, chalk-face! Your fear invites me to eat, what I should be very loath to snatch from you as plunder. The black slave merchants, who travel up along the Senegal and Gambia, say your nation is famed for humanity and bravery: I won't insult its character for courage, by attacking such a paltry specimen of it as yourself. But I apply to you on a score which they say no Englishman can withstandâan honest family is perishingâsuccour the distressed. Mug. Take all the basket, and much good may it do you. I'm a little nervous, but, hang me, if I do this out of fear! When my heart is full, I'd as leaf my stomach was empty. Mad. You are a good white man. How can I thank you? Mug. Don't say a word; munch dumb. Lord love you, I'm made secretary of state to the Mandingo king, and have got plenty. Mad. Ha! how did that happen? Mug. Why, his majesty is a monarch of great natural parts, but he can neither read nor write;âso, just as he was going to cut my throat, his majesty humanely considered that I might be of a great deal of use to him, and generously spared my life. Mad. Yes, and he'll poison you, when he has no further occasion for you. He is no rightful ruler; but worked and bullied himself into power. When the troubles about liberty broke out among the Mandingoes, he was of low note among their warriors. Enterprise and good luck gave him, at last, complete sway over the fighting men;âthat's everything, when a nation is in a ferment, and the successful upstart is active, cruel, and cunning. But what has it made him? Why, the usurping king of a people who murdered their true king, because they would have no king at all; and the pillaging protector of some trembling neighbours, whom he forces to say, come and shoot one half of us, that the survivors may thank you for putting their property into your clutches. Mug. I happen to be his secretary of state, for all that; so I must do my dutyâand, in my official capacity, see what I have drawn up as my first maiden letter, and sent to the English governor at the factory, at the mouth of the Senegal. Mad. Well, let me gather all the intelligence I can, before I quit youâbut, be quick. Mug. Don't hurry a cabinet minister; it will spoil your preferment. No merchant has been up the country lately, and his majesty is out of paper; so I wrote my official letter on a bit of slate, [Pulling out a pocket-book.] and here is a copy. I commanded the state messenger to be very careful not to spit on the despatches, for fear of rubbing them out. Mad. Let me hear them. Mug. A little patience, as I used to say to my creditors. I always took in the Gazette, at Snow-Hill, and by conning it over, this kind of job comes as smooth as a bit of polished ivory. Mad. Begin. Mug. I'm going. [Reading from the pocket-book.] âSir, I have the honour to inform your excellency, that his majesty Demba Sego Jalla, the Mandingo king of Kassan, whose important cares of state have never afforded him leisure to learn to write,âhas taken many prisoners now on sale. The capture has been so great that T. O.ââthat's turn overââthat it will be worth the English traders' while to travel up to the camp to inspect them.â Mad. They'll never come so far inland. Mug. Won't they? The messenger is returned, and they are all expected here in grand cavalcade this very day. I knew my style would fetch 'emâfor hear what I have added. [Reading.] âI have the honour to inform your excellency, that, if the merchants take the trouble to come, I'll be d?d if they won't find a lumping penn'orth. I would send a list of the killed and wounded in this affair, but slate runs short, and no paper. I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration, your excellency's most devoted servant, Henry Augustus Mug, wood and ivory-turner, No. 25, Snow-Hill; were all orders are executed on the lowest terms, for ready money only.â Mad. White man, I must hurry from you. The provisions which you have given me, are wanted by those who are now perishing with hunger. Mug. Why didn't you scamper off towards the desert? I hear all have run there who were not taken prisoners.â Pray, Mr. Madiboo, if I may make so bold to inquire, what's become of your mammaâyour mother? Mad. What's that to you? Mug. [Frightened.] Oh, dear! nothing at all; I didn't mean to be impertinentâbut only to make my kind inquiries after the health of the good family. Mad. I would tell you how we are placed; but unthinking friends often divulge the serious secrets of those they would serve, and bring them into calamity, without intending it. Farewell, white man! I hope we may meet again; I owe you much, much gratitude. Oh, Mahomet! can the heart receive more thrilling transport than this unexpected treasure will afford me, by enabling me to preserve the life of her who gave me birth! [Exit, hastily, R. Mug. He's offâand what's very uncommon, has taken with him, without fee or reward, all that a secretary of state had to give, to the utmost satisfaction of the donor. I shall go back to the camp, with a clear conscience and an empty stomach. SONG.âMug. By trade I am a turner, and Mug it is my name, To buy a lot of ivory to Africa I came; I met a trading blackamoor, a wooly old humbugâ He coax'd me up his land, and made a slave of Mr. Mug. Crying, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you come, Mr. Mug? My skin is lily white, and the colour here is new, So the first man that they sold me to, he thump'd me back and blue. The priest who bought me from him, in a tender-hearted tone, Said, come from that great blackguard's house, and walk into my own. Crying, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you come, Mr. Mug? Good lack! but to behold the vicissitudes of fate; I'm his black Mandingo majesty's white minister of state. For hours in my lobby my petitioners shall stay, And wish me at the devil, when I hold my levee day. Crying, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you come, Mr. Mug? [Exit, L. SCENE III. âA Wood.âA rude shed is seen among the trees, R. U. E., which Darina's sons have formed as a temporary residence for their motherâa bank, R. Torribal comes forward from the shed, supporting Darina. Tor. Come, mother! this wayâmore into the air; Bear up a little! Madiboo, I hope, Will hasten back to us, with nourishment. Dar. I'm not in pain; I think the worst is over: For they have told me, and I feel 'tis true, The famish'd never struggle at the last:â Death spreads a gentle languor o'er their limbs, And they expire in slumbers. Tor. Oh, mother! Do not talk so; you cut me to the heart! Rest upon the bank. Madiboo loiters.â And as for Selico, I'd cast him offâ Dar. Hold, Torribal! No words of bitterness among my sons. Tor. He has neglected you. Dar. No, no! Tor. He has! Dar. He saw me here in safety. Tor. Saw you distress'd! Then he left youâfor five days has left you! If e'er again I cross himâ [Passionately. Dar. Peace, I charge you! I have woe enough!âLet me not hear One of my children vilify the other. Tor. [Tenderly, and kneeling.] Have I offended you? Dar. [Pressing his hand.] You are too sudden. Man, the commanding wonder of creation, Has, like the insect, his allotted time To do his task, and perish. Brief the span, In which he reckons up these several claims Parents, wife, children, sisters, brethren, friendâ And sometimes more, crowding at once upon him; Besides the common social ties, that smooth Life's road, and gently slope it to the grave. Tor. Ah! 'tis trueâvery true, my mother! Dar. Sure, then, no blame can fall on Selico, Who helps to bear his mother from the war; Then leaving both his brothers to protect her, Hastes back to seek his bride, alive or murder'd. Tor. Hark! a footstep! [Looking off, L.] Ha! 'tis heâ'tis Selico! [Darina rises. Enter Selico, L. Sel. [Crossing to Darina, R.] I am here again, to ask a blessing. Can you forgive a wanderer? Dar. Forgive! You had urgent and dear cause of absence. You seem dejected;âtell me 'tis fatigue, Not disappointment, that has made you thus. Have you been prosperous? Sel. I left my brother, Just at the outskirts of our ruin'd town, Resolved to bring you food, if food were in it. But I could find none. Tor. Could not? Chilling news! Dar. 'Twas not on that account that I inquired What has befall'n;âit wasâ Sel. [Distressed.] I know;âI know. Dar. Tell me ofâ Sel. Our good priest?âandâandâ [Pauses. Dar. Berissa. Sel. [Much agitated.] Mother, their fate is certain; no more now,â Some other time I'll tell you. Dar. Selico, You torture me! Their fate is certain!âSpeak! Have they escaped? Sel. Not so. Tor. Conceal'd within the town, then; And, like ourselves, in want of sustenance. Sel. No, Torribal, not that. Tor. [Sorrowfully.] Then they areâ [Hesitates. Sel. Ay;â Brother, you faulter;âwhat then must I feel, When I pronounceâthey're butcher'd by the enemy! [Darina turns aside, with her hands to her face, and totters to the bank. Tor. But are you sure of this? Sel. Certain! Fearing I might shock my mother with a token, Which, if display'd, would break the news at once, Within the hollow of a tree. I hid, Before I came in view, Farulho's mantle. How I obtain'd it, let Madiboo inform youâ And spare my wounded feelings. Tor. Selico, I fear that I have sometimes seem'd unkind; Forgive meâ'tis my nature to be rough; But Iâin short we never know how much We love a friend, till he is in affliction. [Embraces him. Enter Madiboo with a basket, hastily, L. Mad. Where is my mother? I've brought provisions! Tor. (C.) Welcome, welcome! Mad. [Pushing by him.] There's no time for welcome; For here's the dinner waiting. But where isâ [Seeing Darina. Oh! she's there! How fares it, mother?âCourage!â See here! here is something to restore you. Cheerly, mother!âInto the shed, and eat! [Helps her from the bank. Dar. You'll all partake? Mad. Knowing there was enough, I snack'd as I kept running on the road. Tor. The shed's small, let Selico go with you. I'll wait, for he, I fear, has fasted longest. Mad. Now, Torribal, that's kind. Why, Selico! [Selico, who, from the time of Madiboo's entrance, has appeared abstracted and lost in thought, starts and runs to Darina. Sel. I had forgot,âIânow, dearest mother! Dar. [Leaning on him.] My poor, unhappy boy! [Selico and Darina retire into the shed, R. U. E. Mad. Unhappy boy! What did she mean by that? Tor. Why, she knows allâ Farulho and his daughter both are dead. Mad. Then Selico has told her;âthat was wrong; She's weak,âsuch news came too abruptly on her. Tor. Not as he utter'd it: he would have strangled Affliction in his breast; she wrung it thence By eager questions: first, he rear'd his head, Loftly in sorrow, like an aspen struck By thunderbolts!âtill, trembling at her breath, He whisper'd out his woe so mournfully, That, were it not for shame, I could have wept Worse than the softest wench in Africa. Mad. Don't think a tear too weak on strong occassions. A sniveller's whimpering fills sorrow's puddles; But when a firm man weeps, each drop's a diamond. Tor. I fear calamity will pinch us harder, Before we find another settlement. Mad. It will, unless we hit upon something, And suddenly. Tor. Ay, but what? Mad. I know not. But this I knowâthere's nothing in the town That's worth a second venture; and where else Is there a chance? Tor. No where; and we must starve. Mad. Not if we can help it; still we'll struggle. Tor. I see no struggle we can have, but one; We must sit down by our poor mother's side, And see her die before us. Mad. Here comes Selico. Let us consult with him how to proceed. Re-enter Selico, from the shed, R. U. E. Sel. Our mother sleeps: food, after fainful fasting, Has lull'd her to repose. Mad. Come hither, then. This meal, which the poor white man gave to me, Has saved her life; but fortune will not send The white man every day. Have you reflected About a fresh supply, when this is gone? Sel. I dread to think on't! Mad. That's worse than folly. Our inactivity is certain death To our dear mother, and to all of us. Tor. Something must be done. Sel. Ay, but what? name it! Mad. Yes, there's the point that sorely puzzles us. For now we are girded by the enemy; And we have neither weapons of attack, Nor instruments, to gain a livelihood By hunt or tillage. In a little time, The winter rains set in; and should that season O'ertake us here, before the stock's laid up, There's nothing but a miracle can save us. Tor. Suppose their camp should break up shortly, 'Twould leave us ranging room. Mad. Suppose a dinner, A day too late, popp'd under dead men's noses! Tor. The camp must soon disperse. Mad. Not yet awhile. There's business that will take at least ten daysâ The English merchants are invited up To buy the prisoners. Sel. [Quickly.] Is that certain? Mad. To-day they are expected in the camp. Sel. To-morrow then my mother shall be rich! Tor. How, Selico? Sel. I'll be a slaveâsell me! The money will preserve my mother's life! She shall have allâall this body's value. So may the trader then become humane, By purchasing a son, to save a mother! Mad. That son shall be myself! Sel. No! Tor. Hold a little! 'Tis true the purchase money would produce us A stock of all we want; and one of us Must be the sacrifice! Let us decide By lot who shall be sold. Sel. No, my brother; Mine is already castâfor more unhappy I cannot be,âmy early hope is gone! I breathed in the soft spring of my desire, Upon the sweetest violet that ever Disclosed its fragrant loveliness to Heaven! Untimely tempest nipp'd the modest flower, And the world's garden is, to me, a desert. Mad. This must not be! Sel. It must,âand you shall lead Me to the camp! 'Twill not be difficult To mingle in the crowd, and some merchant Find, willing to strike the bargain. Mad. Horrid! You make my blood run coldâI cannot do it! What! sell my brother? Sel. To save your parent. Had we agreed, as Torribal proposed, Still one had done this office for the other. Tor. Then let it be my lot. Sel. I'll not consent. You two are heart-whole; wretched as I am, I should be useless here. [To Madiboo.] Come with me, nowâ Or, by our prophet! I will seek the camp Alone, and having found a purchaser, Trust to some chance to send you back the money. Hark! there's our mother stirringâwe must part! Say we go out to forage. Mad. Torribal, what can I do? Tor. [Mournfully.] It must be as he says. Sel. Let me embrace her for the last, last time, And leave her, then, for ever! Mad. I shall choke! Darina appears at the opening of the shed, R. U. E. Dar. Torribal, how you stay! you must be faint; Pr'ythee, come in and eat. Tor. I come, directly. Sel. And we, dear mother, now must leave you. Dar. [Coming forward.] Leave me!âso soon, my son? Sel. Yes, to seek more food. I must say farewell! Dar. Must say farewell? There's a something in that word that makes My heart feel heavy. Sel. [Apart to Torribal.] Adieu, my dear brother! May you long live happy! [Presses his handsâthen turns to Darina. One kiss,âstill one. May Heaven shield and bless you, mother! Now I am ready.âOnwards, Madiboo! onwards! [Exeunt, Selico and Madiboo, hurriedly, L., Torribal and Darina, sorrowfully, into the shed, R. U. E. SCENE IV. âThe Camp of Demba Sego Jalla, Mandingo King of Kassan. Enter Mug, and several Mandingo Warriors, L. U. E. Mug. Pray, black generals, brigadiers, majors, colonels, and captains, keep your distance. I am secretary at war, and it is not pretty to press so strongly upon cabinet questions. First W. Our prisoners are lying upon our hands: we only want to know when the European merchants will come to purchase them. Omnes. Ay, ay, that's all. Mug. But his majesty has commanded me not to let you know the time. First W. Why? Mug. Because you are all so greedy: you would run out of the camp to meet them, and forestall the market;âbesides, nothing but a verbal message has been given. Second W. We don't believe it. Read the letter sent by the factory, that states the day when they will arrive. Mug. Thus far I am free to reply to the gallant general of the black countenance, who spoke last. The finances of the country, from our late glorious victory, are in a situation that may make us proud; but I assure the gallant general, that on the subject now under discussion, no authenticated papers (however loudly they may be called for) have yet reached my office. But set your hearts at rest; I dare say you'll all drive your infernal trade to your own advantage, and your unfortunate black and copper cattle will go at a good price. [A march is heard at a distance.] Hark! [Looking off, R.] By the Lord Harry, the merchants are coming already! Run, and draw out your prisoners. [Exeunt the Mandingo Warriors, hurriedly, L.] There they are, in full march! What a capital procession!â Some on horsebackâsome on oxenâand a long lanky jockey, that looks like their leader, is stuck upon a camel. Lord Mayor's show, on the ninth of November, is nothing to it. [The music is heard stronger. Enter the European Merchants in procession, R.âFetterwell, the chief of the merchants, seated on a camel, attended by six SlavesâCaptain Adamant, Marrowbone, Flayall, Grim, and four other Merchants. Fet. [To Mug.] I sayâwho are you? Mug. Secretary at war to his Mandingo majesty Demba Sego Jalla, king of Kassan. Fet. Are you? then help me off my camel, and I'll give you a shilling. [Mug helps him off.] Zounds! but he's a bone-setter! [The Attendants lead off the camel, R.] Are you the person that sent the letter to the governor at the factory? Mug. I was commanded by the king, my master, to write the despatch. Fet. Well, then, you are Henry Augustus Mug; turner in wood and ivory when you are in London. Mug. Yes, and secretary at war, while I'm in Africa. Fet. Well, master Mug, your two professions agree nicely, as the world goes: you are not the first, by many, who has wriggled himself into power, when he has been in the habit of turning. My name is Fetterwell, long known as a merchant in the slave trade. Here are other gentlemen of my profession. Are we to see his majesty? Mug. Not to-day; he has got the belly-ache. Fet. A very odd court excuse for not seeing a sovereign! But let me introduce my friends and brother traders.â Here's Mr. Flayall, bound to BarbadoesâMr. Grim, going to Jamaicaâyoung Mr. Marrowbone, once a carcass butcher in Clare-Market, but an estate dropping to him in the West India Islands, he now barters for blacks, instead of bargaining for bullocks,âCaptain Abraham Adamant, who lost his left leg when the inhuman negroes chucked him down the hatchway, for only stowing fifteen in a hammock, in hot weather,âand sundry others. Pray, gentlemen, be known to the secretary. Mar. Pray, Mr. Quisby, how do you think we shall find the market? Mug. [Aside.] Mr. Quisby!âOh, this is the young Jemmy butcher. [Aloud.] What d'ye buy, sir? what d'ye buy? Mar. Buy slaves, to be sure. Mug. I don't know what they may be a pound to-day; markets varyâ Mar. I can't see why they should, here. Mug. Can't you? Now, supposing you were put up to sale. Mar. Me? [Laughing.] Ha, ha! that droll;âbut what then? Mug. Why, then a calf's head might fetch more or less to-day than it would to-morrow. Fet. Well, but where are the parties? Mug. The black generals are arranging their prisoners. Fet. We must make short work of this, as this will be our last venture; for, when I left London, a bill was passing that will kick our business to the devil. Mug. I am very glad to hear it. The work begins in the natural quarter, and the stream of freedom flows from the very fountain head of true natural liberty. Here come the generals with their prisoners; and we shall have the common marketers pouring in, on all sides, directly. A March.âEnter the Mandingo Warriors with their Prisoners, L. U. E., and range themselves opposite the Merchants, L. CHORUS OF WARRIORS. First Party. March, brave Mandingoes, march! in triumph shout! And draw your well-won prisoners out. SOLO.âSecond Warrior. When Afric conquerors tread the field, Slaves are the harvest battles yield. Chorus. March, Warriors, march! Mug. [Aside.] Rabbit me, if there isn't my darling short bit of a love, Sutta, among the prisonersâand among his majesty's own proper lot, too. If I could but buy her off, for myself. Fet. A pretty decent show. Mar. Yes, the women are tricked out as gay as a porkshop on Saturday night; and the men seem tolerably strong. Mug. Now, gentlemen, I must address you in my official capacityâso listen. Hem!âGentlemen auctioneers of the two-legged repositories: I am commanded by the king my master to inform you, that it is his majesty's humane decree, that you may purchaseâyour fellow-creaturesâ but if you steal, or smuggle, a single slave, he will, with infinite regret, put you to death in the tenderest manner imaginable. Fet. The devil he will! I wish we hadn't come here. Mug. The market will be open a whole week; at the end of which, if any of you prove defaulters, so great will be his lenity to you, as his customers, that he will give you the choice of your executionâof which there are three sorts in this country.âYou may either be burnt, impaled, or scalded, which ever you think the most agreeable. Fet. This is a confounded arbitrary government. Let's look over the goods. Now take care, my honest, respectable friends, neither to smuggle nor steal. [The Merchants go up the camp, Mug accompanying them. Enter Selico, Madiboo, and an English Merchant, R. Mer. He's of the Foulah tribe, I believe? Mad. Ay. Mer. I would not give three mickellies for a slave of his breed; they are not reckoned so hardy as the black negroes. You'll get little or nothing for him, now the market is so well stocked.âGood day! [Walks away. Sel. They all reject us. What did he offer? Mad. I can't tellâI forget.âMy heart sickens! Sel. I fear, my project now may not succeed. The pittance they offer us could not Support my mother through the winter. Mad. No matter. Mahomet forgive me! But I had rather we should all perish, Than you should be the price of our living; And I employed to carry home the dross. [A bustle heard without, L. Stand aside, Selico! stand aside! Something extraordinary has happened. Yonder is the white man; he mustn't see us, Lest they at once discover who we are. [They retire. Enter a Crier, L., followed by Africans, who crowd round him. Africans. Hear him! hear him! hear him! Crier. [Reading.] âProclamation and reward!âLast night, a man, with his head muffled in his garment, escaped through the fire of soldiery, from the tent of the king's favourite female prisoner. Whoever shall bring the offender into his majesty's presence, so that he may be punished with death, shall receive four hundred ounces of gold.â [Exit the Crier, R., followed by the mob.âFetterwell and Mug come forward, C. Fet. That's a good lot.âI'll take the whole. Mug. You have picked the prime of the market; those are the tit-bits of the prisoners, and reserved for his majesty's own private pocket. Fet. There's a little short girl among 'em, though, that I don't think worth a fathing. Mug. [Aside.] Bless her! that's my Sutta. [Aloud.] Hasn't she a sweet face? Fet. Well enough for a blackamoor; but faces do no work in the West Indies. Mug. You have a devilish bad taste. I'd rather have her than all the rest tied up in a bunch. Fet. Why, master Mug, it is my opinion you are fond of that little black pony. Mug. Oh, love! You know not, Mr. Fetterwell, its powerâI do. Fet. Then let me off at a hundred for the whole lot, and I'll chuck the girl to you as a bonus. Mug. Will you? I'm naturally honest in office, but the tender passion makes me peculate.âDone! Fet. Then the lot's mine. [Going among the Slaves, and pushing Sutta out from the ranks.] Trundle out, little one, and get a new master. [Exit with Slaves, R. Sutta. Oh, dear! who my massa now? Mug. Your own Mug. Sutta, don't you remember your Henry Augustus? Sutta. Ah, massa Mug! you alive? Mug. Alive! why, I'm secretary to his Mandingo majesty. Come this way, and I'll talk to you. [Exit with Sutta, R.âSelico and Madiboo come forward. Sel. 'Twas a large reward the crier offered. Mad. It was. Sel. 'Twould make my mother rich for ever. Mad. Ay, but that's hopeless. Sel. No, not so. Mad. Not so? Sel. No, certainly; the merchants, you perceive, Just offer that which would prolong existence A few short daysâ Mad. To leave us as we were. Come home, dear Selicoâcome to the woods, And let us trust to fortune. Sel. Never! Mad. No! Sel. I never will returnâno, never, brother, Hapless as I am, while I have means To save a parent, and the means are offered. Mad. What are the means? Sel. You heard the proclamation. Four hundred ounces, paid at once, in gold, Would be a treasure. Take me to the king; Drag me before him as the criminal; Do you receive the offer'd sum; depart, Preserve my mother's life;âleave me to death. Mad. Oh, God! you drive me mad! [Kneeling.] Brotherâdear brother! On my knees, I entreat you to hear me! Sel. I am wild, but fix'd! Mad. Think on the torture! Sel. That may be calculated. She who bore me, Suffer'd with joy the throes that gave me being; The pangs that I endure, to save her life, Will be as short and grateful. Mad. Proceed not! Sel. I'll raise the campâproclaim myself the culprit, If you refuse! Mad. Where would you hurry me? Sel. To the king's camp!âGo onâI am resolved! Mad. No!âyou will repent, Selico. Sel. Never! Mad. I scarce know what I'm doing. Sel. Go forward! [Exit Selico, L., resolutely dragging off Madiboo. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âThe Interior of Demba Sega Jalla's Tent. Music.âDemba discovered reclining in African pomp, R., surrounded by numerous Attendants. Dem. Who was the leader of the guard, last night, Over the females' tent? First A. 'Twas Daucari. Dem. Where is he? Dau. [Coming forward, L.] Here, my king. Dem. Do you not tremble? Dau. At your displeasure? ay. Dem. No, for your life, manâ For your life!âKnow 'tis now in danger. Dau. 'Tis always so when'er I fight for you, But no one sees me tremble. Dem. Daucari, You have been negligent upon your post. Dau. You are my kingâI dare not contradict you. [To one of the Attendants. Come hither, you! Know you how many years I've been in battles? First A. Thirty, as I've heard. Dau. Tell me in all that time I once was faulty; Say so, that I may cry 'tis false, and stab you [The Attendant shakes his head, and retires. My king, that fellow, who ne'er flinched in war, Dreads to accuse me, lest I kill a liar. Dem. You are too bold. [Rises, and comes forward, C. Dau. I hope not so, my king; Innocence, though tyrants reign, is fearless. Dem. Call you me tyrant? Dau. I'm too politic. Dem. Would you betray me? Dau. I'm much too loyal. Dem. Skill'd as you are in warfare, think you not I must be lothâvery loth, to sentence You to death? Dau. YesâI am useful to you. Dem. On that account I'll spare your life. Dau. That's wise. Dem. And for your service past. Dau. That's gratitude. Dem. I placed you, Daucari, to guard a female, One of my slaves of war, whose melancholyâ Death's havoc doneâlook'd softer than the willow Which graces the wild margin of a lake, And droops o'er recent wrecks. She mourn'd so mildly, That when her anguish forced a tear to fall, A patient dimple caught it. Time, I Had hope, would soothe her girlish grief, and yield Me a willing treasure. Your base neglect Has let some lover steal to her by nightâ She has profaned my tentsâand she shall surely die! Dau. You charged me, king, to head the western guard, Not to become a sentinel. I watch'd not All night, at one tent's mouth, I did my duty In visiting the posts;âand when, at dawn, I saw a stranger skulking from your slave,â A cloak before his face,âmy order was To fire, but he escaped. 'Twas the sentry's Neglectâbut he's punishedâfor I shot him! Dem. Dull fool! and so prevented all the means Of trying the delinquent, to discover Who 'twas that fled. But the reward that's offer'd, May bring detection yet. Begone! [Daucari crosses to L. Enter Mug, R. Dem. Now, white man, how's our prisoners' market? Mug. Dull, my liege. Dem. Tell me, what monkeys, or what merchandise, You have obtained among the Europeans, In barter for my slaves? Mug. Bless your royal soul! not a halfpenny yet in hand; we mustn't deal with the wholesale traders, as if your majesty kept a chandler's shop. Dem. How then? Mug. Oh, let me alone; I'm up to business by living in the city; I have your majesty's interest at heart. You are my kingâonly be ruled by me, and you'll do. Dem. Christian, your words, like your features, are So very different from other men That I both smile and wonder. But explainâ What is a purchase, when no value's given? Mug. Why, the European merchants are what we call good men; and they have entered your majesty's market to buy stock, just as if they were walking into a black Royal Exchange. Some come on camels, some upon oxen,âthat's the way they waddled into the country. 'Tis pretty sure they'll come down with the dust on settling day, for without that they know your majesty won't let 'em waddle out. Dem. Still I cannot comprehend your meaning! Mug. Leave it all to me. Little more than a week will finish the job. In the meantime, may it please your black majesty, don't turn dun; but as I am now joining the fatigue of chancellor of the exchequer to the labours of secretary at war, I humbly hope you'll double my emoluments. Dem. Fear not! you shall have ample honours. Mug. I am more partial to profits;âand, from all I have heard of your majesty's unprinted court calender, if it's the same to you, I'd much rather receive a salary than be knighted. Enter Second Attendant, L. Second A. There's one without who brings a prisoner, For whom he claims reward by proclamation. Dem. Now, by the serpent that's my deity, The wretch who glided from my captive's tent! Away! set him before me instantly! [Exit Second Attendant, L. Go, white man! be faithful to your trust. [To Mug. Mug. Having nothing to do in your majesty's Old Bailey department, I retire from the levee. [Exit, R. Enter Madiboo with Selico, Second Attendant, and four Soldiers, L. Dem. [To Madiboo.] Nowâspeak! Mad. [Aside.] I scarce am able! [Aloud.] I've brought a Man to die,âdon't let it be by torture,â A man, whoâgrant me, pray, a little pause, For you may see I tremble. Dem. Be composed. Who is he? Mad. [In great agitation.] Who!âhe is myâ Sel. [Hastily interrupting him.] Prisoner!â That's plain enough. Your presence, conqueror, Awes my accuser, though it awes not me. Dem. [To Madiboo.] Proceed in your speech. Mad. [Hesitating.] There is a rewardâ Four four hundred ouncesâ'tis in goldâfor him Who brings the culprit, whoâpray pardon me, I cannot utterâ Dem. One who fled my tents, Under the muskets of my soldiery. Is that the wretch? Mad. [Looking at Selico, and, in agony, throwing himself into his brother's arms.] I am the greatest wretch! Dem. [Amazed.] Ha! weeping o'er the prisoner! Sel. [Quickly, over Madiboo's shoulder.] No wonder! He's my bosom friend, and has betray'd me. [Puts Madiboo gently away. Hear me avow, what he lacks power to tell I left the tent at dawnâescaped the shotâ Whisper'd the fatal secret in his ear. He heard the proclamationâhe is poor! Riches too often sap a poor man's virtue, And his could not resist! He bouud me while I slept, then dragged me hither. Give him The goldâme my fate! Dem. Sure as the evening sun Closes its sloping course behind the hills, You suffer ere it sets! Sel. I am prepared! Dem. [To his Attandant, and pointing to Madiboo.] Bring him the recompense. [Exit Attendant, R. Four hundred ounces, paid to you in gold. 'Tis fit that I should keep my faith with you, Though you have basely broken faith with him. 'Tis said I'm cruelâI may be so in warâ Warriors must be torrents. Peaceful friendship Should be so calm, that if a thought of gain Ruffle the bosom of a friend, then gold Should seem a pebble cast upon a pond, Whose surface for a moment is disturbedâ The cause soon sinks, and all is still again. Mad. Keep your gold, and let my prisoner go. Dem. Your prisoner?âmine! Take your reward, or leave it,â Still he is mine; and jealousy's revenge Makes iron justice harder. Vivid lighting May strike and melt me; a feign'd compunction Is far too weak a fire to make me bend. Re-enter Attendant, with gold, R. Give him the gold. [Madiboo receives it with horror. Go, buy intoxication And drown your conscience! Guard him well! and Give order in the camp for execution. This day the female slave and he shall die! [Exit into the tent, followed by Attendantsâothers remain to guard Selico. Mad. Oh, brother! Sel. Hush! the guards will overhear us. Mad. I ne'er shall see you, dear Selico, more. Sel. Never! You'll see my mother,âthink on thatâ Think on the treasure in your hands. Mad. Psha!â'sdeath! Sel. Not so; it will preserve a parent's life. Conceal my fate from her; tell the good soulâ 'Twill not be falsehoodâtell her I've journey'd To a far distant country, for her good; And, if she ask how soon I shall return, Evade the questionâsayâsay we all shall meet. But do not, brother, let her see you weep. Second A. [To Madiboo.] You must be gone. Mad. One moment. Selico, In infancy we often kiss'd each other; Now you must die,âI would not ask it elseâ I'll print a manly farewell on your cheek. [Embraces him. My dear brother! Mahomet support you! [Exeunt, Madiboo, rushing off, L., and Selico, guarded, R. SCENE II. âA Wood. Enter Torribal and Darina, L. Tor. 'Tis madness to persist!âMother, turn back. Dar. I would not, were a lion in my path! Tor. There's peril in the camp. Dar. There's torture out on't, While my son's a slave. The shaft of Heaven Alone shall stay me! Inconsiderate boys! Too kind to me, too cruel to yourselvesâ One of my sons basely to sell the other! Tor. Famine Wrung you, mother;â'twas done to save your life. But return, I beseech you! Dar. I will not! If they have made my Selico a slaveâ And if the conquerorâ Tor. He'll not hear you. Dar. Will not hear me! All Africans have hearts: And surely, they who've drain'd their mother's milk, Imbibe some pity for a mother's feelings. Oh! when at the conqueror's feet I bend, And cry, âRestore to me my child!âa gift, To you a trifle, but to me a world!â If he reject my prayer, his infancy Has spurned human breasts, to suckle with a tiger. Tor. I was to blame to breathe one word of this. Dar. You! I drew it from you. Few can conceive A mother's quickness for her absent child. If she inquire of one who saw him last, How 'tis he fares, a lookânay, half a look, Alarms her; and a hesitating speech Is almost confirmation somewhat's wrong. Go onward, son!âIf you refuse to guard me, So let it be.âI'm a poor weak woman; But still maternal love will give me strength To crawl into the camp, and save my boy. Tor. Wherever you go, I go!âRush madly down The cataract, you'll find me by your side! Stand back! here's some one comingâscreen yourself! Enter Madiboo, carrying the gold, R. Mad. Who's there? Tor. Friends. Mad. Torribal! can it be you? Tor. Yes. Mad. And my mother, too! How happens this? Tor. She will go the camp. Mad. [Shuddering.] Oh! you must not go! Dar. I will go thither! Mad. [Aside.] What a scene of horrorâ Dar. No power shall prevent me! What is that You bear about you? Mad. Gold, dear motherâgold,â Enough to give you affluence for ever. Dar. Then to prolong my life a scanty term, Which nature soon must end, you sold my boy. Mad. I wish I had. Dar. You wish you had!âWhat's done? Tor. [Taking Madiboo apart.] I do not understand you, Madiboo. What has been done? Mad. [Wildly.] Oh, do not ask me! Tor. You have gold there? Mad. Ay, four hundred ounces! Tor. Not for the purchase of one poor slave? Tell Me, how came you by it? Mad. Do not question me. But if you can, devise some means to keep Her from the camp. Tor. You are agitated. Mad. Distracted, brotherâalmost heart-broken! Another time I'll tell you all; at present, My heart's too full. Keep her awayâTorribal, Keep her away! I'm too weak, I cannot. Tor. Dear mother, let us return. Dar. No, never! Mad. You know not what you'd go to see. Dar. My child! In sicknessâhealthâin slaveryâin deathâ Mad. [Shuddering.] Death! Dar. Ay, e'en in the agonies of death, A mother fondly clings around her child. Mad. [Aside.] Oh, heavens! 'tis so she will cling round him. Dar. Quick! forward to the camp!âI am resolved! [She rushes off, R., Madiboo and Torribal follows her. SCENE III. âThe Camp of the Mandingo Kingâpreparations for an executionâa pile of faggots, R., another, L.,âand various implements of torture. Selico, Guards, Executioners, and a crowd, discovered. Sel. Nay, do not torture me before my time. Your king, who means to see my parting Agonies, has not yet arrived. Then stand Aloof, ye ministers who execute The sentences of power! How need must warp Poor human nature, when a man turns jailer. No one, sure, first made it his election, To live on his fellow-creature's sorrows. Oh! how flinty must his office make him, If, when his petty sway might mitigate The prisoner's woe, he doubles it! Is that the stake where I am doom'd to die? Second E. Ay;â And the partner of your crime dies with you. Sel. Oh, poor soul! Death in a conqueror's camp, Is swift in visitation; gives no time, As oft he will round pallets of the sick, For leave-takings, and kindly offices;â Else would I strive to calm her flutter'd spirit, Support the sinking trembler, and, with A fellow-sufferer's firmness, cheer her up. Second E. [Advancing to Selico.] Prisoner, our faiths differ; few Mandingoes Profess your creed, and follow Mahomet. You may think me cruel, but you wrong me. If, in the camp, there's a Mahometan You wish to pray by you, I'll find him out, And bring him hither. Sel. Thank you, heartily. There's no religion, as I think, on earth, In which weak man can not exclaim, âThe worship I was born to, others may reject.â But, while I glow with charity for all, I trust, howe'er my heart pours out a prayer I may, at last, obtain my Maker's mercy. Second E. Say, can I serve you? Sel. No, good fellow, no! [The Executioner retreats some paces, and Selico kneels. Dear spirit of my murder'd love! if e'er It be allowed mortality to soar Into the breast of Heaven, and look down On what is left below,âbehold me meet Death's agony in smiles!âSoon we may wander In airy blessedness:âno battle-axe Can sunder love in those pure realms of bliss; No ravagers of war can butcher age, Or pinch with famine. Prophet Mahomet! Scorn not the prayer of a poor African! [Rises. [Muffled drum, and flourish. Second E. Harkâhark! the Mandingo king approaches! Enter Demba Sega Jalla, and Attendants, L. U. E.â the music plays as they march down the lines of the campâthe King places himself on an elevated seat, R. C. Dem. Criminal, some have said 'tis my nature To be too lavish in decrees of death; They say I wanton, too, in shedding blood: Therefore, I come, that you, yourself, may own Your sentence just. Sel. More just than merciful. Dem. Can justice, then, be call'd unmerciful? Sel. Justice and Mercy are distinct; when join'd, 'Tis sweet to see the mild companion smooth Its stern associate's brow; and when the sword Is lifted, smilingly present the sheath. Atrocious guilt can hope for no indulgence! But there are cases, where the judge's eye May drop a tear on him whom he condemns; And, when a king has power to sentence, He might remember he has power to pardon. Dem. You stole into my camp; the laws of war Pronounce it death. Sel. Ay, if I came a spy;â But you have sentenced me on other grounds. I skulk'd not hither, o'er my native plain, That smokes with fire, and blood, to carry back A vain intelligence to carcasses. You dread no spy from towns you have subdued, For there your plan is to exterminate. In warfare you murder even infants At shuddering womens' breasts, and silence All fears of a reprise, by butchery. Dem. Bold wretch! you were received within the tent Of her, who heard my love, and then disdain'd itâ My favourite slave of war,âmy guard beheld you. Sel. He who is above all guards, beheld you Tear all your slaves of war from every tie Humanity holds dear, and still has spared you. Dem. Mine is the right of conquest. Sel. Conquest's right Gives a true hero the delightful power Of shewing conquest's generosity. And what's your right? A battle gives it you. What are the ties of those you pluck assunder? Why, time and sympathy have knotted them: And should you die instead of those you part, It might be nobler justice. Dem. Witness, soldiers, Your king's forbearance,âwitness how I bear These taunts with patience. Sel. Oh, mild murderer! Every ally you plunder, owns your meekness. Specious destroyer! amiable despot! Domestic creature of the tiger breed, Who pur upon your prey before you kill it! Dem. [To the Attendant.] To execution! [To Selico.] You have violated A warrior's camp, and you must suffer. Bring in the female prisoner. First A. She's here. [Muffled drum. Enter Berissa, in a veil, and trembling, L.âshe is supported by two FemalesâGuards follow.âSelico's face is averted, contemplating the pile, R., whereon he is to suffer. Dem. Throw off the captive's veil.âShe knows her fate. Ber. [Removing the veil.] I do; and though I tremble, am resign'd. Sel. [Starting.] Did I hear right?âher voice!âit cannot be! [Turning suddenly round..] Berissa! [She utters a piercing shriek.] She lives!âMy love! my life! [He runs to her, and they fall into each others arms. Dem. [To the Guards.] Force them apart! The greatest outrage that Man's pride endures, is when his love is scorn'd By her he's knelt to, whom he might command; And who, insults him to his face, by lavishing Her fondness on his rival. 'Tis excess Of female insult, thus to gall my heart. Ber. Hear me! I swear, by the holy prophet! While bending o'er the awful brink of death, Though one was in my tent, [Pointing to Selico.] it was not he. Sel. [Aside.] That's truly sworn; but proves her false as wantons. Oh, mother, mother! 'tis for you alone I now should wish to die. Dem. I'll not be fool'd By female oaths. Did he not, e'en this instant, Rush to your arms, while fervently you clasp'd him? Nay, has he not himself made full confession? Captive! you who disdain'd your conqueror's loveâ You, whom I sued to share dominion with me,â What motive, now, inspires you to deny The guilt of your accomplice? Think you, thus, To save him? If he be not culpable, Then name the criminal. Sel. [Eagerly.] Ay, ay! name him! Ber. Mark, king! This man's impetuosity To hear the culprit named, proves him guiltless. Dem. That's doubtful;âbut you can clear the mystery. Ber. Had I a thousand lives, and ev'ry life Condemn'd to twenty thousand agonies, I'd ne'er divulge the secret. Remember, When you approach'd me with your selfish passion, I then avow'd my heart no longer mine. I dared not utter falsehood: think you now I dare advance it, dying?âI repeat, Innocent blood will lie upon your soul, If he be sacrificed! Dem. Truth seems to gush As purely from those lips, as bubbling streams Forced from the fairest fountain. Butâno, no! Yon slave himself avow'd it. Set the piles On fire, and lead the culprits to their fate! Enter Four Executioners, with torchesâtwo go to each pile and remain behind themâother Executioners prepare to bind the prisoners to the stakes. Sel. King, if a corner in thy beating heart E'er held a drop of pity for the dying, Grant me one word with yon poor sufferer. Dem. You scarce deserve it. Let them speak together. [Selico and Berissa meet, C. Sel. Berissa, how I loved you know; how you Have loved I doubt. Ber. That doubt, dear Selico, Is worse than agonies of death. Sel. Indeed? Ber. Indeed!âOh! if there be a secret, I dare not tell, e'en you, at such a moment. From the whole course of our pure, simple love, Why should you think me faithless? But tell me, How came you hither? Sel. We have no time for that. Ber. Say, then, you think me true; for I can swearâ Sel. No, do not, love; your words are holy writ; They're balm to me! Forgive my suspicions; Your affirmation's everything. Oh, love! This sceneâ[Drums rolls.] We partâfarewell! Both. Farewell!âfarewell! [They retire to the stakesâa noise is heard without. Enter Farulho, rushing in hurriedly, L. Far. I will press forward, ere it be too late! [Prostrates himself before the Kiag. King! king! in me behold the real culpritâ A poor old man, who strove to steal his daughter. Dem. Your daughter! Far. Yes, that wretched girl is mine. 'Twas I that sought her tentâ'twas I escaped The muskets of her guardâshe tried, in vain, To follow her old father. Take your victimâ Save him, who is not guilty, and let me Perish with her (if she must die) for whom Only I wish to live,âmy darling child! Dem. [To the Guards.] Release them for a while. [The prisoners come from the stakes. Ber. But for a while! Then let me snatch this moment to embrace My dear, dear father! Far. [Embracing her.] Oh, my child! my child! Dem. [To Selico.] Say, why did you avow yourself the culprit? Sel. Conqueror, to you, who make mens' dwellings ashes, Domestic tales of woe, that follow triumphs, Will not be pleasing. Dem. Speak!âI need not say Speak boldly, you have spoken so already. Sel. The dying, wrung with griefs, will use some license Towards those that wring them. Dem. You had an accuser, Who brought you to the camp. Sel. He was my brother. Dem. Your brother! Sel. Yes.âOh, king! you little think On all that war, in its extremity, Inflicts on nature. You approach'd with fire, When peaceful joy was throbbing in our breasts; When I was leading my loved bride to mosque. She's there! the daughter of this good old man, Our priest, revered by all. I thought them dead; For in my search I found two headless bodies Clad in their outward garments. Far. Did you so? Alas! then, two poor faithful souls have perish'd, In zeal for me and mine. My honest servant Descried me,ââFly, dear master, fly! give me Your mantleâI am youngest; and your daughter Shall change her dress for mine; and if they dare Invade this sacred place, I'll pass myself Upon them for the priest: then, should they battle, I'm more stout than youâmy girl less timid Than your dear tender child.ââAnd so we fled: But still I lost Berissa in the tumult; Then traced her to the camp;âand my poor servants Have fallen victims of their love for us. Dem. [Aside.] I know not what it is about my heart, That stirs me thus. In all my victories, No tale of sorrow that I ever heard Touch'd me so near as this. [To Selico.] Tell meâwhen you conceived these people dead, Why were you rendered as a criminalâ And by your brother? Sel. To save a mother From perishing with hunger, whom your fierce wars Had driven to the woods. The sum you offer'd, Would snatch her from the pangs of famine To affluence; and I enforced my brother To drag me hither, as a sacrifice. Dem. And knew she this? Sel. No. Dem. Her name? Sel. Darina. Darina. [Without, L.] Guards, give wayâand let me to the king! Sel. Ha! 'tis my mother's voiceâthey've told her all! Enter Darina, L.âshe rushes forward, and throws herself at the King's feetâTorribal and Madiboo follow her. Dar. King, pity a mother, and spare her son! Tor. Mother, be calm! 'tis not the way to soothe. Mad. Leave her alone! a mother's cries will pierce A heart of flint,âlet her alone, I say! Dem. Rise, woman! your suspense shall soon be o'er. Where is the English merchant from our lines? Merchant. [Coming forward.] Here! Dem. Merchant, have you attended to this process? Mer. I have. Dem. Then pr'ythee, merchant, tell meâyou Of wisdom and experienceâyou, who boast A country, as they say, more civilized By far, than mineâat how much would you rate A man like this? [Points to Selico. Mer. For his uncommon virtues, At full a thousand crowns. Dem. I'll double that, And give it to Berissa,ânot to buy, But to marry her faithful Selico. [Selico and Berissa fall at Demba's feet. Nay, rise, my heart was never moved till now. Mad. [Dancing and singing.] My dear mother!âmy dear brother!âmy good old priest! [Singing.] I'm so happyâI shall jump out of my skin for joy! Enter Mug, with a long written paper in his hand, and Sutta under his arm, R. Mug. May it please your majesty, I have drawn up a petition, which, as you never learned your A, B, C, according to our English fashion, I will make bold to read to you. Dem. What is it, white man? Mug. Why, I have just heard of some poor condemned folks, who were formerly my friends; and, as they have not murdered, nor forged, nor robbed, on your majesty's highway, it's very hard if a secretary of state hasn't interest to bring them off. [Looking round.] Eh!âoh! I see by your countenances 'tis settled already. [To Farulho.] Oh, my dear old master! Lord, Mr. Madiboo! how are you, and all the rest of your family, after your confounded fright? Sel. Come, love!âmy dear Berissa!âMy mother! We have been sorely tried! Ber. But we can say, Whatever we've endured, â'Twas virtue's trial.â Sel. Oh, how sweet! when after virtue's struggle, We lay our hands upon our heart, and cry, We've suffer'd Heaven's scourge with resignation, And resignation is repaid with bliss! CHORUS. The contest's overâwar's alarms Now leave our native plains: Then welcome friendship's charms, For smiling peace remains. Sutta. Then, after cold and wintry showers, The west wind breathes, and sunshine's ours: Sweet spring,âeach heart of care beguiling,â Sweet spring returns, and all is smiling. Chorus. The contest's over, &amp;c.</field>
