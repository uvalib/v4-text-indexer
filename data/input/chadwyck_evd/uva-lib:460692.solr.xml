      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âSir William Sutton's House.âAn Ante-room leading to a Ball-room.âMusic as of a Ball.âDancers seen in the further Apartment.âVisitors passing in and out. Enter from the Ball-room, Walsingham and Bradford. Wal. Fair revels these, Sir William Sutton holds, And all in honour of the city maid! Sure the whole town is here, such swarms pass in And out. Is it a match, as they report, Betwixt the maid and brave Sir Valentine? Brad. In prospect, sir; but, yet, I question much, If in a year hence, nearer than to-day. She with the lust for conquest is possess'd Incontinently. Victory with her Must follow victory. 'Tis strange so long It pleased her that Lord Athunree should wear The chains, Sir Valentine aspires to now. Pity a maid with treasure past compare Of gorgeous beauty, and with lands so broad, Should use her riches with such huswifery, As makes one pity her possession of them! Wal. Lo you, she dances, and, for partner, takes Lord Athunree, and not Sir Valentine. A novel measure that! know you its name? Brad. No!âAy!âa liberal measure!âSee!âhis hand Retains possession of her waist; while hers, Nothing repelling, on his shoulder rests, Permitting neighbourhood so close, embrace Were scarce in privilege a jot beyond it! Wal. You know Lord Athunree?âhis character?â The limits of my acquaintance. Brad. No, sir. Wal. Sir, He is a libertine. He hath been much Abroad. That dance, I will be bound, is ware Of his importing. Yes; a libertine! A man of pleasureâin the animal Ignoble sense of the termâthat owns no curb Of honour, generosity, or ruth; Nor hath a single grace, except the nerveâ A contradiction which would make one question That valour is, of itself, a thing to boast ofâ To vouch the wrong he does, and stand by it! Brad. You say this feelingly. Wal. Because I feel it. I had a friend, whose heart could scarce lodge weal Or woe, without the privity of mineâ A friend of quick affectionsâand a villain Compass'd the ruin of the maid he loved. That villain was the lord, who dances there! They foughtâThrough odds in skill, the honest arm Was master'd by the foul; but vengeance, though 'Tis baffled, is not lost! Good morning; for More than an hour or twain, 'tis past the turn Of night.âFree thanks for your free converse with A stranger. Brad. Sir, the like I render you: But will you not delay some moments more? In spirit, yet the revels are but young! Wal. Sir, I am pall'd with themâand were I not, That lord approaches, and the sight of him Would put out keenest zest of joyance. Brad. Have with you, then; far as our road is one, We'll go together. Wal. Sir, right willingly! [They go out. Enter Lord Athunree and Felton. Ath. 'Tis not for him, by sheer effrontery, For two years I have held the foremost place 'Mongst swarms of lovers close besieging her! Made one and all to stand aloof, whene'er I thought they press'd too near! Fel. I have marvell'd oft At your success. Ath. Of blood-letting, you know, In the high mode, I have as little fear, As need of it; and would they come to that, I soon convinced them, that I knew their art Better than they did. Fel. To say the truth, the foil Has stood you much in stead, when you required Weapon of graver practice.âFound you ever Your equal in the fence? Ath. Ay; and my master! And therein do I tax my lucky stars, That watch not o'er me now. He is here in the house, That gentleman from travel late arrived, Who, with the gloss of the fair countries which He has been seeing, shines, and quite puts out All light of homely worth. Fel. Sir Valentine? Ath. The same; That knight of France, though son of England. Ay, And would-be captain too, to Venus, sir! Would take the fortress, all who would carry which, I at impracticable distance still Have kept; yet come no nearer than I was To winning it, when first set down before it. Fel. Fear'st thou surrender then to him? Ath. Humph! Fear? That âfearâ 's an ugly word! âDo I fear?â He is quick! His point and eye together go! He marks And hits, at once! His sword is part of him, Part of his hand, sir, as his hand, of his wrist; The very moment that your weapons touch, He is here, and there, and in!âhis lounge, a shot You see not till 'tis home! We quarrell'd once, And twice I felt him, ere a man could say That he was well en gardeâbut touches, yet Forerunners sure of heavier paymentâso I gave the battle up!âYes, I do fearâ Save I have hit him, as I think I have, Apart from lounge or parry! Fel. Hit him! How? Ath. I' the brain and heart, sir, without damage of The skin! Through the eyes, sir, that take hit and hit, And ne'er the worse, howe'er the practice tells Within! He is a man of sentiment! Sentiment, mark you!âthat is, flesh and blood, I' the summer cool as springâor water, sir, At the boiling point without a bubbleâor wood Without ignition in the heart of fire! An ample span of forehead!âMark!âa full And liquid eyeâfree nostrilsâcrimson lips, Cushioning one another without stint Of the velvetâand a chin could show a copse Of beardâa man, sir, with all these, and yet With wishes innocent as thoughts of babes! A lie, sir, on the face of it!âyet such He passes for unto himselfâbelieves Indeed he is, and so of others judges Through the false colour of this self-delusionâ Particularly women. He would have them Earth to himselfâto all else, things of heaven! Impassive to impression, as the air Which man ne'er yet gave form or colour to! Fel. Well? Ath. Saw you not I danced with her just now? Fel. Fair Hero? Ath. Yes; I did dance with her a free And liberal danceâthe dance of contact, else Forbidâabandoning to the free hand The sacred waist! while face to face, till breath Kisses with breath, and eye embraces eye. Your trancÃ©d coil relaxing, straightening, round And round in wavy measure, you entwine Circle with circle, till the swimming brain And panting heart in swoony lapse give o'er! Fel. I know; that foreign dance thou, late, brought'st home. Ath. The very same; I taught it her, and first Danced with her, to-night. Fel. I had admired To see you. Ath. Had you not, I had admired! The card-room kept you. Give you joyâYou won! But to the dance. The evening half was out, And still he held her ear. Fel. Sir Valentine? Ath. Who else? who else that seat pre-eminent By her fair side had held in spite of me. I watch'd for my occasion, and it came. Some friend besought a moment's audience. Ere 'Twas done, her waist was in my custody; Her white arm hanging from my shoulder, where Her hand, confiding, couch'd. âYour game goes well!â I whisper'd her; âPlay boldly, and 'tis yours! The measure this, to set the outline off! Give sway to thy rich figure! Abandon thee To the spirit of the dance! Let it possess thee! Float thee, as air were footing for thee! stud Thy cheeks with smiles of fire, and give thine eye The lightning's dazzling play! fix them on mine, That each may feed the other's, like to tongues With converse, thick'ning converse!â Fel. Well?âI see Thy drift! Ath. Thou shouldst have seen the issue on't;â While, like a pupil at a task he loves, Whose aptitude with eager will outstrips His master's bidding, she was twenty times The thing I wish'd her! How she rose and sank With springy instep; while her yielding waistâ Well as her waving neck, her beauteous headâ Her falling shoulders, and round bust, show'd off! A world she look'd and moved of passionate Quick senseâof loveliness and joyousnessâ Of which, be sure, I pass'd the reigning lord! Nor with the dance did my dominion cease; But when her drooping lids, relaxÃ©d steps, Disparted lips, and colour vanishing, Gave note she must give o'erâher languid form, Close girdled by my arm, her hand in mine, Her cheek for pillow on my shoulder laid, I led her to a couch, where courtesy Of course admitted tendance! Fel. What of him? Ath. He is mad, sir! When he turn'd, and noted us, He look'd as one who question'd his own eyes; Then stood awhileâno doubt admiring how Step did keep loving time, and how we moved In closest neighbourhood, disparting but To meetâher arm, a link, ne'er letting go! Then with a start of sudden fury went, And cast him on a seat with folded arms, And knitted brows scanning us, as he wish'd His eyes could do the office of the lightning. I cared to mark no moreâI saw the storm I wish'd would come, was on; and knew 'twould hold! Fel. And does it? Ath. Yes; thrice she advances madeâ As women know to make them, unobserved, Except to practised eyesâto draw his notice. Dropp'd her glove near himâwish'd she had a chair, And one at his handâcomplain'd of thirst, and just A salver brought to him with wineâbut all In vainâright in his eyes display'd her form In attitude of tender languishmentâ And to no more account than offerings Of gems before an idol made of stone! But see; we have danced out the night, and day With fresh and flushy vigour fast comes on; You hear the rout breaks up. Attend him home; Obtain his ear; know nothing, but be sure Of slightest opportunity he gives For her disparagement, to take advantage. Here comes the Queen of the night, and all forlorn, As she had lost her throne! Enter Hero, leaning upon Emily. Emily. What miss you, Hero, That thus you pause and turn; go on again, And pause and turn again? Fear'st anything, Thou hast forgot? Hero. No! I have danced too much To-night. The night before it was the same! No restâAll revels!âMadness, with a frame That is anything but iron. [Turns to look back. Emily. There again! I'm sure there's something that you missâWhat is it? Hero. My spirits only! Are not yours nigh wasted? [Turns again. Ath. [Aside to Felton.] She waits for him!âHe saw her home last night. My life on't she must look for other squire. Emily. Come. Hero. Are they dancing yet? Emily. What do you hear, To make you ask? You're dreaming! Saw you not That the musicians left the room before us, And scarce a dozen laggards then remain'd, Besides ourselves? Hero. I know not what I saw, I am tiredâheart-tiredâtoo tired to move or restâ A weariness, won't let me go or stay! Ath. He comesâaccost himâask him of the ball. [Aside to Felton. Enter Sir Valentine. Fel. See I Sir Valentine, the last of all The revellers? Sir Val. You see him, sir! 'Tis e'en Sir Valentine. Fel. Liked you the ball to-night? Sir Val. Yes!âNo! Fel. What! Liked it, and disliked it? Sir Val. Yes! Fel. It was a very handsome ball. Sir Val. It was. Fel. What was amiss, then? Was the music bad? Sir Val. The music far from bad!âmost excellent! Incomparably goodâIt were in place In a concert-room,âI found no fault with the music. Fel. Are you not fond of dancing, then? Sir Val. I amâ Innocent pastime taken innocently In honest mood!âBut there are natures, sir, That should eschew itâwhich 'tis pernicious toâ As wine, that's mirth to some, to some is madness! I find no fault with dancing! 'Tis an act Sets beauty off, proportion, graceâwhen these Are too set off by modesty. For menâ And women more especiallyâof the vein That's opposite, I'd have them lookers onâ For their own sakes firstânext for the sake of those, Who what they'd blush to do, lament to see Enacted. Fel. Was there any dance to-night Offended you? Sir Val. Nâo, sirâI cannot sayâ Perhaps there is no harm in any dance, I am not sureâSome may give too much licenseâ Yet not so much, but e'en in such a case By delicacy 'twill be carried off Becomingly. I might perhaps objectâ Yet where's the thing that can defy objection? But this I say, sir, and to this I'll stand, That modesty being to woman more Than beautyâfor, without it, beauty's cheapâ That woman, who can show her beauty off Before her modesty, forgets herself, And merits forfeit of that high respect, Which noble minds would bear her! Hero. [To Emily.] What lady, can you tell me, danced to-night As lady should not dance? Emily. I do not know. Hero. [To Felton.] Do you, sir? Fel. No! Hero. [To Lord Athunree.] My lord, do you? Ath. No, lady. Hero. Perhaps some lady whom the gentleman Danced with himself, and none, beside him, noted! Sir Val. No lady, madam, 'twas that danced with me, Who yields to me her hand shall never risk Herselfâat least by my o'erstepping. She Shall find I know the honour that she does me; See, in the freedom of the frolic measure, My reverence for her sex attending her; And then be handed to her seat again, For mine own credit sake, if not for hers, By all approved, as gracefully come off In partnery of honest joyance! No lady, madam, 'twas that danced with me. Ath. The plague repay him for the lesson he So freely reads meâin her presence too! Hero. Wilt please you name the fair that gave offence? Sir Val. 'Twere a presumptuous act for my poor tongue. But if you know her, you must know her beauty; Wherein I ne'er met fair to liken to her, And that more fittingly shall name her for me. A noble stature stopping there, where sex Would have it reach, and bid it go no farther; A head of antique mould, magnificent, As may consist with softness and with sweetness; Features, advertisement of thoughts and moods, Wishes and fancies, such as it beseems To lodge with chastity and tenderness In sumptuous palace of rich loveliness; And limbs of mould and act therewith consorting, Making a paragon of symmetry!â Gods, to such homeliness of use perverted, As properties, to them were homeliness, Should spurn to be applied to! Emily. Are you ill, That you turn pale? Hero. Ill!âWhat should make me ill? I could be angry, were it worth my while At such disparagement of one, it seems That's known to me,âbut calumny is a thing That blurs itself, and I should be despised, Did I pay heed to! Sir Val. Lady, you are right; It shall be calumnyâit should be so! Vouchers so fair, should never be forsworn. Alas for him, who is incredulous, Yet would believe them rather far than doubt them! [Sir Valentine goes out, followed by Felton. Hero. A most strange gentleman!âAn oddity! I took him for a man of sense!âDidn't you? A fanciful and churlish gentleman! Looks sour because another man looks pleased! Lord Athunree, wilt see my carriage brought Close to the door before I venture out, If not to tax your gallantry too much? Ath. I fly to do it. [Goes out. Hero. Let me weep a moment Upon your neckâThere! I am better now. Are my eyes red? Emily. Not much. Hero. I will appear To have been laughing! Laughter will bring tears. Most excellent!âYou should have kept it, though, For another time! I have not strength to laugh! As 'tis, I am so weak, I laugh and cry. Re-enter Athunree. Lord Athunree, your courtesy has lost you A most facetious story! Ath. Tell it me. Hero. Tell it you! Tell it! I am dead already With hearing it, and must not hear't again, Would I go home to-night! A little plague, To make me laugh, and know that I should cry, For lack of very strength.âCome, let us go! A charming ball! Fair nightâmost happy night! I'll find a time to make you cry with laughing. [To Emily. A charming nightâa very charming night. [They go out. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âA Room in the House of Monsieur de l'EpÃ©e. Enter, from an inner Room, Walsingham and Monsieur de l'Epee. De l'EpÃ©e. Your progress answers to your practice, sir; Cause have you none for discontent. Confess, You play the foil with twice the ease you did A month ago. Might I be credited, Not only each new week, but even day, Puts to the blush the former one, so fast You catch the mystery of the fair art. Wal. Yes; but my fellow-pupil heads me still. De l'EpÃ©e. His quickness is your master. Wal. Yet, 'tis strange! With all my pains, I toil behind him still, And he a very stripling! De l'EpÃ©e. 'Tis not strength That makes the odds, but art. To turn the foil In practised hand, almost a wheaten straw Hath stamina enough. The point deceived, An infant's arm, in distance, lounges home. The art is strength, and length, and everything. Wal. To say the truth, it is a noble art, On which agility and grace attend, With proper manhood keeping company, As on none other;âmaking lightest ease To champion force, and, as you say, bear off The palm from it. In every act and stateâ Salute, guard, parry, feint, or passâit hath A bearing worthy of the eyes of kings And their high consorts, when a practised hand Like yours takes up the foil. De l'EpÃ©e. You flatter, sir! Wal. By my proud honour, no! But, to your pupilâ Who is he? De l'EpÃ©e. I know not. Wal. He is very young. De l'EpÃ©e. Yes; by his looks he has a teen or twain To count;âthough never scholar study plied With manlier resolve and constancy. It often moves my wonder, that so slight And delicate a frame should undergo What, to robuster mould, a thousand times I have mark'd was weariness. Scarce lays he down The foil, before he takes it up again, Some parry, feint, or lounge, unmaster'd yet, To practise;âwhich he does with zest so keen, I have thought, at times, that in his fancy's eye There stood, before his foil, an enemy, The actor of some unatonÃ©d wrong, Whose heart each thrust was meant for.âA good morning! I am waited for. Wal. Good morning to you, sir. [De l'Epee goes out. A noble fellow that!âa soldier who A mighty captain follow'd, for the strides With which he led to gloryânay, for them Deserted not, when fortune back'd a world, Marshall'd against her off-cast favourite! Talk you of scars?âThat Frenchman bears on crown, Body, and limb, his vouchers, palpable, For many a thicket he has struggled through Of briery dangerâwondering that he Came off with even life, when right and left His mates dropp'd thick beside him. A true man! His rations with his master goneâfor he Was honour's soldier, that ne'er changes sidesâ He left his country for a foreign one, To teach his gallant art, and earn a home. I know him to be honest, generous, High-soul'd, and modest; every way a grace To the fine martial nation whence he sprang! This is a portrait. My brothers of Glasgow know and honour the gallant man who suggested it, and will judge how far it is a faithful one. At all events it is not flattered. Eustace enters from Inner Room. My fellow-pupil! [Aside.] That was a shrewd guess The Frenchman made. Are all these pains to pay An enemy?âthen is his case my own. Would I could gain his confidence! but still, Oft as I try, he foils me with reserve, He shows to none beside! One more attempt.â So, fellow-pupil! You have given o'er at last. Right well you fenced to-day! You are weary? Eust. No. Good morning, sir.â Wal. I' faith, you âsirâ not me! We have been mates too long, methinks, for term, So niggard, fellow-pupil!âWalsingham Is my name. I prithee, when thou next accost'st me, Say Walsingham. Is't not enough, your foil Keeps me at distanceâwill not let me inâ Rebukes me! shames me!âwill you with your tongue O'erbear me too? Call me not âsir,â I pray, But Walsingham. Eust. It were to make too free For mere acquaintanceship. Wal. Acquaintanceship! You have known me for a year. Friendship has grown In half that time! Eust. Friendship grows not by time. Wal. In sooth 'twould seem so. Daily have we met For good a yearânor yet have shaken hands. Give me thy hand, and let us hence be friends! What! will you not? I'faith, you shouldâyou shall! I'll take it spite of youâyea, though you frown, And call yourself my foeâwhich would be hard; To make a foe, striving to make a friend. Eust. [After a pause.] I'll shake hands with you. Wal. Ha!âa hearty grasp! But take it not away so soon again, Nor where you give your hand, refuse your eye. Why don't you look at me? Eust. Let go my hand! Wal. Such haste to take awayâso frank to give? Eust. Let go my hand!âWell, you may keep it, sir; You cannot make it like its prison, nor, When once 'tis free from't, enter it again. Wal. Wellâcall me Walsingham, I'll let it go. Why must I force you thus to be my friend? Eust. Why should you? Force made never yet a friend! Wal. For kindness, then! why would you hold me off? A man repell'd of fortune! See you not, I am not of the vein of those on whom She lavishes her smilesânor do I think With surfeit of such sweet you bought that cast Of thoughtfulness, which when I look upon you, Like to my glass, shows me, methinks, myself!â I am a man of honour and of heartâ Ah, too much heart! Come, call me Walsingham, And then I'll let you go. Eust. WellâWalsingham! Wal. I' faith, most kindly did you sound my name; Tongue never fell it yet more sweetly from, Save one!âSave one! Eust. Farewell! Wal. We'll walk together. Eust. Nay. Wal. Will you have it so, why have it so; My love is not that sturdy beggar yet, But spurning may suffice to stop its craving! Yet ere you leave me, hear meâand, then, go. Methinks our fates in something are alike; To prove it so, or not, I'll tell thee mine. Give thee my confidenceâmake thee indeed my friend! Now, once for all, what say you? Eust. Be it so. Wal. Thy hand again, then!âDo we go together? Eust. We do!âHave with you! Wal. Now we are friends, for ever! [They go out. SCENE II. âA Room in Hero's Town House. Enter Sir William and Emily. Sir Wil. At sea again! Blown ever from the port We'd have her harbour in, by her wild fancies, And far from land as ever! 'Twas my hope This suitor would have proved sure anchorage. Emily. And so 'twas mine. She'll ne'er be held by suitor, Long as there bows anotherâsave it be By a miracle. I say it, though I love her! Sir Wil. And yet that lord hath held her. Emily. So he hath, By dint of mere audacityâsome art, He owns, makes other suitors quail, and she, For vanity, hath still affected him, As proud to have a vassal in a man To whom his fellows bow. Sir Wil. I am glad so slight His power. I know him for a profligate, With broken coffers, to replenish which He merely follows her. Emily. His practice 'twas Which to this issue ledâOn some account I know notânay, nor guessâhe durst not treat Sir Valentine with overbearing mien, So took advantage of fair Hero's weakness, To play upon't, expose, and with disgust Surfeit the man he fear'd. Sir Wil. And he succeeded? Emily. Ay, to the full, sir, as I have possess'd you. Sir Wil. I am sorry for it. He had begun to love her, And would have made to her a worthy husband; Safe guardian to her wealth; and one to make A proud wife of a higher dame than she! It crossly hath fallen out. But she is piqued, You say at his desertion? Emily. Much, sir!âMuch! She wept, as I acquainted you. Sir Wil. You did, And matter see I there. UnfeignÃ©d tearsâ And such were hersâfrom deep-laid fountains flow, Abiding in the heart! The argument Which draws them thence, as deep must even go. A curling lip I had not heededâthat Were simple scornâbut they who weep, for scorn, Must weep for something more. Sir Valentine Hath not his peer in England! Trust me, girl, She's not so blind with folly, as not to see His paramount desert!âWhere is she? Emily. Lock'd In her chamber with her milliner,âso says Her maid. These three hours have I craved admission, But all in vain. She has not yet press'd pillow Sufficient to repair her spirits from The waste of yesternight. Sir Wil. A wayward girl! New dresses, pleasures, loversâall things new, Except herself. Would that would change, as well! Some mode she studies with her minister Of novelty, to flog all former folly. [Knocking. What sober knock is that?âSuch seldom calls At her fantastic door. Who knocks? Enter Servant. Servant. A man, Of formal habit and consorting speech, Usher to one most young and fair; a maid Who seems to know no use for beauty, but To mortify it with ungainly guise. She asks to see the mistress of the house. Sir Wil. Admit her!âOn what errand can she come? [Servant goes out, and returns, showing in Clever, followed by Hero, both disguised as Quakers. Who art thou? Clever. Man unto Ruth Mapleson, Who with the woman of the house would speak. Sir Wil. The woman of the house! Emily. Ruth Mapleson! Hero. Friend, am I right? This house of vanity, Is't the abode of that unfortunate They call the City Maid? who, to the use Of one, perverts what Heaven lavishly Committed to her, for the good of many! Is this her house?âand if it is, I pray you Acquaint her that a sister, pitying Her hapless state of blindness, ignorance, Omission and offence, hath come to her To clear her vision, to inform her mind, To teach her occupation, and from evil To turn her steps aside.âUmph! Clever. Umph! Sir Wil. My breath Is almost stopp'd with wonder! Emily. So is mine. What can it mean? Sir Wil. Some poor fanatic 'tis, Whose zeal hath warp'd her reason. Hero. Sinful man, Thus is it with the children of the flesh! What argues wisdom they misconstrue madness! Though through perverseness rather than conviction. Tremble!âLook down!âAbase thee to the dust! Shouldst thou not blush at thy grey hairs, the vouchers For thriftless years, for profitless experience! 'Tis winter with theeâharvest-time is pastâ What hast thou garner'd? Chaff instead of grain! What doest thou with gauds like these, thy trappings? Why standest thou beneath this roof of pride, That shouldst be thinking of the charnel-house And the attire of its inhabitant? I know thee uncle to that maid of lightness, That mistress of this house of emptiness, And whom I come to chasten and reform! Umph! Clever. Umph! Emily. Dear sir! who is't? I grow uneasy! With sense of the unearthly, and I feel As though an apparition stood before me, And wish she were away! Sir Wil. And so do I! Hero. [To Emily.] And thou, poor flesh and blood!âillusion!âheirdom O' the worm! that think'st thyself all soundness, yet Art all corruption! Why abidest thou in The lazar-house? Depart from it! Pull off Its dress, and don the clean and wholesome guise Of plainness and humilityâUmph! Clever. Umph! Sir Wil. This bold intrusion and addressâ Hero. Peace, Satan! And yet, perhaps I wrong you! Privily You may condemn proud Hero's fantasies? Sir Wil. I do! Emily. And so do I! Hero. O do you so? Then are ye not, as I did reckon you, O' the children of the Prince of Darkness? Sir Wil. and Emily. No! Hero. You see that she is miserably vain? Emily. We else were blind. Sir Wil. Stone blind! Hero. Capricious? Emily. Yes! As many moods as there's hours in the day. Sir Wil. Say minutes, rather! Hero. Fond of pleasure? Emily. 'Tis her constant occupation. Sir Wil. 'Tis her meat And drink; rest, business, studies, prayers, and sleep! Hero. She hath no constancy in aughtâ Lovers especially? Emily. She changes them Continually. Sir Wil. As she does her dresses Show her a new one, she casts off the last, How new soe'er put on! Hero. I pity her. Emily. She scarce deserves it. Sir Wil. Pity is too good For such a piece of waywardness, perverseness, Pride, folly, fantasy and emptiness! Hero. So then we are all of the same mind? Emily. Exactly. Sir Wil. Not a pin's point difference! Hero. You would approve that I reform her then? Emily. Reform her! can you do so, do it! Sir Wil. Do! Do! Make her anything but what she is. Emily. Change cannot fail to better her. Sir Wil. No change Can make her worse!âReform her, pray! Hero. I will. Sir Wil. and Emily. When? Hero. When you take her for another thing And find her just the same!âO, uncle, fie! Fie, Emily! Is this your loyalty? Sir Wil. What means this metamorphosis? Hero. Defence Of my sex's rightsâassertion of my own! Instruction to that master-work, call'd man! Protest and re-establishment of due Prerogative! reduction of rebellion, Transform'd from rearÃ©d crest to bended knee! Pains, penalties, bonds, confiscations, deaths, To follow thereupon! Sir Wil. Why, niece, what wind Has brought this change of weather? Hero. Are you a man? Sir Wil. I trust I am! Hero. Then if you are, you know The privileges of a single woman. We have few, we thank you, when we change the state Of single blessedness, most rightly dubb'dâ Is't not a single woman's right to rule? Sir Wil. It is. Hero. To have her will her law? Sir Wil. It is. Hero. To have as many tastes, moods, fits, as she likes? Sir Wil. It is. Hero. To come, to go, to smile, to frown, To please, to pain, to love, to hate, do aught Without dispute? Sir Wil. It is. Hero. Is't not enough, You have leave to look upon herâlisten to herâ Stand in her presenceâwait upon her? Must Her 'haviour, speech, be what you like, or what It likes her sovereign self that they should be? Sir Wil. What likes her sovereign self! Hero. You are a man! Would all your sex were like you! Who are not, Are not for me, believe me! Look you, uncle! I'll make the saucy traitor feel my power, Or I will break my heart! He thinks me fairâ I thank him! Well-proportion'dâvery much Beholden to him! Dignified and gracefulâ A man of shrewd perception! very!âsend him On expedition of discovery! Sir Wil. Whom mean you, Hero? Hero. Whom?âSir Valentine! He has made his bow! Indeed, a gracious oneâ A stately, courtly, condescending one! Ne'er may I curtsy, if he bow not lower! I'll bring him to his knees as a spoil'd child With uplift hands that asketh pardon; then Command him up, and never see me more! Sir Wil. Why, how hath this befallen? Hero. I did not dance To please him! No, sir! He is a connoisseur In dancing!âhath a notion of his own Of a step! In carriage, attitude, has taste, Dainty as palate of an epicure, Which, if you hit not to a hair, disgust Takes the place of keenest zest! He is sick of me! My feet the frolic measure may indulge in, But not my heartâmine eye, my cheek, my lip, Must not be cognizant of what I doâ As wood and marble could be brought to dance, And look like wood and marble! I shall teach him Another style! Come! I have found you out; Will you compound for your sedition, And help me? Come! How say you, little traitress? Emily. Content. Hero. And you, most reverend rebellion? Sir Wil. Command me aught, that I can do in reason. Hero. Can do in reason! In what reason? There Are fifty kinds of reason! There's a fool's reason, And a wise man's reason, and a knave's reason, and An honest man's reason, and an infant's reason, And reason of a grandfatherâbut there's A reason 'bove them all, and that alone Can stand me now in steadâa woman's reason! Wilt thou be subject unto me in that? Sir Wil. I will. But say where practised you, to act so well The solemn friend? Hero. At school. Sir Wil. At school! Hero. I learn'd it from one I knew and loved thereâa sweet girl Half, by the sect that uses it, brought up. But she of thought and will, therewith consorting The mistress likewise was, most veritable! Her name was Helen MowbrayâBy the arts Of that same lord to whom I owe the coil I would unwind me from, and whom, through whim, Not liking, I have countenanced, 'tis said She fellâbut not in my belief. How is this? I am growing serious! You will help me? Sir Wil. Yes. Hero. That's my good uncle! That's a darling uncle! There ne'er was kinder, nor more sensible! A good, dear, wise, obedient, docile uncle! Give me a kiss! Hence, Master Clever! Do What I directed youâSir Valentine Be he at home;âinvite him where I advised youâ To the house at Greenwich. [Clever goes out. Sir Wil. What dost thou intend? Hero. Order the carriageâno; it must be one They lend for hire:âand come along with meâ I'll tell you on the way. Emily!âUncle! Look you! [Throws her glove down.] I'll have him, as my glove, that there, At my feet to lie, till I please to pick him up! And I will pick him upâbut in a way! There!âgive it me againâO, you dear uncle, To help my plot!âdo what I wish!âYou ought To be an uncle! There's another kiss! And if I do not make him kiss the rod, I'm ne'er a niece deserving such an uncle! Come! come!âI did not dance to please him! Come. [They go out. SCENE III. âSir Valentine's House. Enter Sir Valentine. Sir Val. Oh, pitiable case! so rich a stamp, And yet the metal base! For what high things Did nature fashion her!âwhose rich intent Had she but half fulfill'd, no wealth, no state That earth can furnish, for aggrandizement Of craving and insatiate ambition, Conferr'd on her, had given her half her due, Far less its debtor made her! Misery! To find the good we hoped, the bane we hate Hate!âO, perverse and doubtful course of love, That in the goal, it pants for, finds its grave! That reaches for a bliss, and clasps a pang! That thinks it owns a mine, and finds it none! O beggary most poor, that from the lapse Of heap'd-up riches grows! Enter Servant. Servant. You are wanted, sir. Sir Val. Who wants me? Servant. One who brings an errand from Sir William Sutton, and craves speech with you. Sir Val. Admit him. [Servant goes out. Enter Clever. Well? Clever. Are you the man they call Sir Valentine de Grey? Sir Val. The man? Clever. The man. Sir Val. I see!âI am Sir Valentine de Grey. Clever. Then, being he, another man they call Sir William Sutton, sends me here to pray Thy company this afternoon, to meet Some friends who dine with him at Greenwich. Sir Val. Say, I cannot come. Clever. Art thou engaged, friend? Sir Val. No. Clever. Then speak'st thou not the truth. Thou canst come. Sir Val. Say, I will not come. Clever. He bade me say to thee Thou must come. Sir Val. Must come? Clever. Yes; so come along. For he gave charge to me to bring theeâand I said I would; and not to bring thee, were To break my word, and I must keep my word. Sir Val. Tell him, I was not in. Clever. I will not tell A lie. Sir Val. Art thou his servant? Clever. No; but man To one that's niece to himâthat's, in the fleshâ Not in the spirit. Sir Val. Wherefore? Clever. Know'st thou him, And know'st thou not he is a man of sin? Ruth Mapleson is of the faithful! Sir Val. Who? Clever. Ruth Mapleson. Sir Val. I know no niece he hath, Save oneâfair Mistress Sutton. Clever. Name her notâ Daughter of darkness! Sir Val. Liar! Clever. Thou dost lie To call me so. Sir Val. Wretch! Clever. Thou dost lie again. I am a godly and a happy man, That waits upon Ruth Mapleson, the niece Of him they call Sir William Sutton; and Cousin to Hero Sutton, whom in naught Ruth Mapleson resemblesâface and form Excepted; wherein she might pass for her, She is so like her! Sir Val. Like her! Saidst thou like her? Clever. Now that's hypocrisy! Thou heard me say it. Like her in voice, complexion, featureâso Put sober Ruth in giddy Hero's dress, Thee'dst swearâWhat did I sayâYoung man, this comes Of evil communication. Sir Val. Well? Clever. Thee'dst say, 'Twas giddy Hero's self, though all the while 'Twas sober Ruth thee saw'st. Sir Val. Incredible! Clever. Young man, thee keepest company that speak One thing and think another! That's my hand; I take't away, and show it thee again: Is it another hand? Sir Val. Knave, 'tis the same. Clever. Miscall me not, friend! Knave is not my name, But Obadiah. Use me civilly, That do instruct thee, who art ignorant. Not more in verity is that hand the same, Than is Ruth Mapleson, in perfect likeness Of feature, figure, voice, complexion, all That makes the outward womanâjust the same, As Hero Sutton! But, alas, within, Winter and summer are not less akin! Sir Val. How, knave? Clever. I told thee not to call me âknave:â My name is Obadiah. Sir Val. Obadiah I'll call thee then. How are these cousins as Unlike, as winter is to summer? Clever. Thus.âIs winter barren? so is the maiden Hero;â Is it made up of fogs and rain? so is the maiden Hero, of vapours and the spleen;âHath it much cloud and little sun? so hath the maiden Hero great discontent, small content;âHath it long night, and brief day? so hath the maiden Hero lasting displeasure, short favour;âIs there any depending upon it? no more is there upon the maiden Hero;âDo you wish it heartily away? so would you be rid of the maiden Hero. Sir Val. I fear thou art a slanderer. Clever. I see Thou lack'st good manners, which is grievous, friend, In one of thy degree. Thou callest names As scavengers that quarrel in the streets, Most unbecomingly! Sir Val. Well; now proceed. What of her cousin? Clever. Though a godly man, Yet am I flesh and blood, and thou dost vex My spirit, friend, by so misusing me. I tell thee once again, my name is not Liar, nor knave, nor slanderer, nor aught But Obadiah. Sir Val. Wellâenough of that; Her cousin? Come! Her cousin? Clever. Though I am A man of peace, I am a valiant man. I combat not, but yet the elements Of war are given me, friend! I am full of them, Save what is in me of the goodly thing That mortifies the flesh, and keeps them in Subjection! Yea, I am a warlike man! Yea, verily, a very warlike man! Sir Val. I ask thy pardon. Clever. I do grant it thee; Thou dost a proper thing; and now shalt hear, Wherein the maiden Ruth, who outwardly, Is to the maiden Hero what that maiden Is to herself, is, inwardly, reverse As summer is to winter. Sir Val. Prithee on! Clever. Is summer fertile? is summer clear? hath it little cloud, and much sun; long day, and short nightâand that more like day, than night? is summer constant, and do you wish it never away? so is the maiden Ruth bounteous; so is the maiden Ruth cheerful; so hath she twenty smiles for one frown; lasting favour, brief displeasureâwhich you would almost take to be favour; so is she little liable to change; so would you wish to have her ever with you! Sir Val. Where dwells this cousin? Clever. In Greenwich, friend, whither thou goest; not in the same house with him that sends for theeâfor light dwelleth not with darknessâbut in another habitation, where her books, and her flowers, and her own sweet thoughts, which are fairer and wiser than either, are her only companions. Sir Val. I'll go with thee to Greenwich straight! Lead on! Clever. Hold, friend!âYou must do all things soberly. [They go out, Clever preceding with extreme gravity. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âThe Outskirts of London. Enter Eustace and Walsingham. Eust. Now for the confidence you promised me. Wal. Canst thou not guess my story? Look at me! Seem my years more than his you'd reckon in Life's outset, when beneath our feet all's flowers, Above our heads all sun? Canst not divine What could alone o'ercast and wither thus? Nor only take away the adjuncts sweet Of that fair prime of hope, but prospect leave Of nought but cloud and barrenness? Eust. Ambition? Wal. No; that's an after-game. There's one we play Before, o'er which the heart will throb, as o'er None other!âwhere we throw the die, whose turn Nine times in ten's the oracle foretells All chance to come! which, if we play in earnestâ And light are they who of that game make lightâ We make ourselves for ever, or lose all, Doubling the value of our being, or Reducing it to naught!âa game, methinks, Which you have play'd atâLove.âAm I not right? Eust. You are. Wal. You didn't win? Eust. [hesitatingly]. I didn't. Wal. How? You speak as one that yet did neither loseâ Whose game not yet was outâa chance, although With heavy odds against him! Mark me; if Thou hast rivals whom she entertains like thee, With just so much of hope, as may suffice To keep them suitors still, while each can say, She's mine, as well as t'otherâgive her up! Away with her! Abandon her for ever! Thou woo'st, what, if thou winn'stâthe tongue is kindâ Not that doth give thee joyâbut wish thee dead! The keeper, not the owner of a thing Wherein is lock'd thy life, and thy life's gemsâ Thy peace and honour dear! Eust. Won such a maid Thy love? Wal. Not such a maid! No! No! she lived Forbid to all but me. The statue's ear And eye, you'd think, as much perception had Of wonder at the consummate chisel's skill, As hers of praise from others' eyes and tongues. But, oh! at lightest glance or sound of mine, How would the rich and fair-wrought marble glow! Eust. Thou mourn'st her dead, then? Wal. Dead?âAy, dead! a corpse, A mouldering corpse, that's with corruption housed, Which skill medicinal can ne'er restore To its sweet life again!âthe which to weep Is all that fondest eyes may look for, now; The life, alas! of her fair honour 's gone! Eust. What! lived she but for thee, and gave she up Her richest jewel to another? Wal. You Shall hear my story. What in form she was, I will not paint to you.âEach lover has, You know, the fairest sheâsay, mine's a paragon As much as thine; yet, of the very charm That's crest of all, thou wilt but make a seat To mount some plume of hers, whom thou affect'st, That shall transcend it far! I know itâso Forbear. Yet had you e'er set eyes upon her! Alas! she stood alone! To truest hearts The sight of her was wonderful estrangement, Weaning them for a time from things, howe'er Clung dotingly to beforeâthat mistresses Have sadden'd to see eyes, that blazed on them Ere they were turn'd away, turn back again Listless and icy cold! Riches and rank, Bestudded o'er and gilded, have look'd blank To see themselves outshone without a gem! Nay, very hostesses, whose only care Was to behold their costly huswifery Approved, have been discomfited to see Their tables crown'd as ne'er they were before, And she the only garnish of the board! Eust. Fancied you not that others saw like you? Wal. No! no! I saw they didâI felt they didâ Felt it through many a pang of doubtâbut not Through fear of her demerits, but my own! Eust. Ne'er gave she cause to doubt? Wal. No! Eust. Still she fail'd? Wal. As lifeâwhen health, that is the heart of life, Seems sound to the very core!âhas ne'er given sign Of flaw or speckâthis moment in the bloomâ The next, is blasted! Eust. What you so assert, The more that you assert, the more I doubt! What! truth to falsehood in a moment turn? Virtue to vice? Love to estrangement? Love! And in a woman! Had she loved before? Wal. No! Eust. Her first love, too!âBut she was a child? Wal. No; in the blush of bursting womanhood. Eust. And left thee for another? No declining Of that first passion? Never seen to wane A little nowânow more? but all at once Go out! Impossible! You've been deceived! Abused! you have! my life, my soul upon it! Wal. They're costly pledges to be forfeited; Then risk them not! Eust. What canst thou set against them? Wal. Proofs! facts! Eust. Facts? Wal. Facts! My cause thou wast engaged in? How is't I find thee in another's listed? Eust. Whose is the cause of her thou lov'st, but thine? Wal. Not if she's false. Eust. But if she's true? Wal. She's not! By truth, she's not! Eust. By truth, she is!âunless, Things, coinciding just as much as the East And Westâhigh Heaven and the Abyssânoonday And midnightâreason and madnessâcontraries Confess'd and palpableâfor so opposed, I own, do your averments seem to meâ You prove to be identical. Wal. Listen, then! Who wins a prize, thou know'st wins envy too. With such a prize thou wilt not wonder then That many grudged my fortune! 'Mong the rest Was one, a satire on the saucy code That makes the wreath of merit, birth-right, when No law can make the grace that wins it so! This titled profligate alone, no check, Reverse, rebuke, rejection, could divert From pressing still his suit: my arm had tried it, But that she hung upon it, minding me The life I'd peril was the heart of hers! She did!âand for enforcement show'd to me Vouchers on vouchersâgenuine sighs and tears! Art couldn't feign suchâI'll do justice to herâ She then was trueâas true as haggard since! Why weep'st thou? Eust. Thou dost weep; and tears draw tears, When grief itself will fail. Wal. Then dry your eyes; You'll ne'er see mine again! you think me lost To honour? Eust. No! Wal. What! not to weep a wanton? Eust. O, not a wanton! Wal. How! Eust. Not then a wanton! Wal. Not then! The devil was once an angelâwhat Of that? He fell!âwho weeps him? no one! What Though she was once a spirit of light, as he was, When now she's black as he? Eust. Nay! Wal. Doubt it not! To cavil at the right we feel to writhe, Is aggravation, that adds wrong to wrong, And drives before-o'erburthen'd patience mad! The sun itself stared on it!â'twas not lewdness Chamber'dâbehind the curtainâ'Twas i' the street, Light as noonday could make it!âwithout cloak! Hood!âveil!âNow call it questionable! Nothing To mask the wanton!âOh! for a thunderbolt, To strike me then!âfrom a noted, libell'd stew, Led by the noble libertineâhis trophy, Worn on his arm, in the gaze of every eyeâ I saw her issue. Eust. Did she shun thee? Wal. No! Eust. That was a proof of innocence. Wal. Of guilt! Rank! rank!âa sudden and entire infection, A touch and rottenness; as from the bite Of a serpent, in an instant, ruddy life To black corruption grows! Why should she shun me? She had her tale at hand! 'Twas but to make Her paramour her friend; their assignation A freak of chance; her reconcilement to A man she loath'd before, a debt; and for That debt assign a cause equivalent;â All which she did in a breath! 'Twas clear, sir; clear! The truth spoke for itself! Fact built of factâ Nought out of place or disproportionate! As obviously that followed this; this, that! As this doth chime with this, and that with that! A thing one must believe!âfrom end to end, A lie, sir!âHe had saved her from a villain! The villain!âwhen she appeal'd to him, he'd damn her! âHe fain would bear her out! His life was hers!â âHis fortuneâbut upon a point of honourâ âIn question with a man of honourânot âThat he denied her fair averments thoughâ âHe pray'd she would excuse him!â Eust. You believed him! Him you believed, that ne'er was true before! Her disbelieved, was ne'er before but true? Wal. Herself admitted it. Eust. How? Wal. By damning silence! Eust. Is't guilt alone, convicted, that keeps silence? Guiltâsaucy guiltâthat dares to break the law Of God and man! Remember you no case, Where innocence accused hath all at once Been stricken dumb?âappall'd to undergo The charge of sin, that never could endure The thought of sin?âappearances against her, And witness for her none, but her own heart? Her very blood betraying her, deserting Its post upon her cheek, whence, were it bold As honest, 'fore a host 'twould ne'er give way! Remember you no case like this? or if Your memory none records, is such a one So much at odds with probability, Your fancy cannot image it? A woman, Young, charily brought up, as vestal for The fane!âsuppose a novice, so sincere, She loved and knew it not, till, by its signs, Others more skill'd find out the passion for her, And told her that she loved! Wal. Thou draw'st herself! Eust. And such a one, by accident or plot, Sudden to stand in such predicament As of her honour valid question foundedâ In presence too of him whose value for The gem had made it doubly, trebly dearâ And then, appealing to a villain's truth, To find the tongue should clear, but blurr'd her more!â Oh! I would ask for signs of life as soon From lips of stone, as look for words from hers! She couldn't speak!âSpeak? breathe! she would be stunn'd To utter lapse of every sense, except That at her heart, which told it at that hour It would be bliss to break! Should she be true At lastâ Wal. No more of this! Eust. Have I not shakenâ Not much, but somewhatâsay, a littleâsay, A very littleâyour belief of her Dishonour? Wal. Speak not of her. Eust. If she is pure, Despite appearances, as first you thought her; Constant, despite desertion; and despite Wrongs, scornings, brandings, fond;âit may be fonderâ For woman's love's a plant, I've often heard, Which mocketh all that thrive in winter time, Not only keeping green, but growing then. Wal. You take, methinks, strange interest in her fate! Eust. I have a friend, whose fate resembles hersâ Whose cause I'm sworn to right! Besides, we're friends. Thou art not happy? Wal. No. Eust. I would see thee so. To have thee so, I'd wish thee in the wrong. She's not forgottenâis she? Wal. Would she were! Eust. Perhaps thou lov'st her still? Wal. To madness! There's My malady. I love herânot what she is, But what she was! What's presentâthat's her swerving, That's palpable, which you may see, touch, handle, Define, weigh, prove by any test is realâ Feels but a phantasm, a conceit, a dreamâ A horrible one!âin contrast with what's past, Her worth, her love, her constancy, that vanish'd Or e'er you question'd them. Eust. Art sure of that? Come, come, thou'rt not, at least, thou'rt not quite sure. Now did she stand before thee undismay'd Confiding in thy honourâsay thy patienceâ Say thy enduranceâ Wal. If my eyes could look The mandate of my soul, they would flash lightning on her. To blast her where she stood! What ails thee? Eust. Noughtâ What did I do? How did I look? What saw'st, To ask? Did I turn pale, or start, or what? Do I tremble? Feel!âI am past fear, grief, pain, As death! Give me thy arm, and come with me. I'll show thee what a piece of rock thou thought'st Was quaking. Thou a false woman, as thou think'st her, Wouldst revengeâI would revenge a woman wrong'd! Bitterly wrong'd! so wrong'd, that after her None should complain of hardship! Come! and see, Which holds his purpose most tenaciously. [They go out. SCENE II. âA Chamber in Hero's House at Greenwich. Enter Sir Valentine and Clever. Sir Val. I tell thee, I must see her! Clever. Friend, thy face, Albeit no modest one, thy deeds outdo In forwardness! I brought thee but to see The maiden's houseâand thou wouldst enter it! Nor therewith rest'st contentâbut must have speech With her that owns it, and escheweth thee, As all ungodly things! Sir Val. And I will have it! So tell thyselfâbut gently say to her, A stranger craveth audience. Mindâa stranger. And do my bidding; else I may forget Thou art a man of peace, and, may be, beat thee. Yeaâbeat theeâI repeat it! and, I pray thee, Make me not do't again! Clever. I will submitâ Ere I will use the argument o' th' flesh, For that would hurt my spirit. Umph! I am gone! [Goes out. Sir Val. So far, so well! Admittance I have gain'd, And now an audience waitâbut doubtingly. Her cousin?âthen behoves me change my name, Else, knowing me for Hero's suitor, she May spurn me. Yes! I'll even call myself Sir Launcelot de Vere.âCan this be she? The knave has mock'd meâand the world of hopes That sudden rose to my imagining, Melts into nothing.âStayâIt forms again! It grows to probability.âNo vapour That takes a passing form!âis here and gone! But a sincere and palpable creation! Another Hero is thereâor I see The same!âOh, likeness at beholding, e'en, Incredible!âthat makes with wonderment The vision waver, and the utterance fail! Enter Hero (disguised as before). Hero. Well? What's your will? Sir Val. Forgive me, lady, if With occupation of mine eyes, awhile I thus forget the office of my tongue To give thee 'custom'd salutation! Stillâ Still would I gaze, nor speak! Art what thou seem'st? Hero. What seem I, friend? Sir Val. Likenessâunlikeness! A thing Most differentâand yet the very same! What I would give averment of, most strongâ Again most strong deny! The form of the bane, With the sweet virtue of the antidote! The rose, was canker'd yesterday, to-day Freshness and soundness to the very core! O beauty conscious of its proper pride! That nothing deigns to ask, to set it off, Except simplicity, that offers nought, Yet all that's due performs! I have not lived Till now!âI have but dealt with shows of life, Automatons, that do not know themselves, But act from causes, are no part of them! But here is nature's mechanismâmind And soulâa body fitting them, informing With motions of their own. Hero. Friend, art thou mad? Sir Val. Mad, lady? Hero. Rational, thou canst not be! Sir Val. Not rational? Hero. If thatâwhich much I doubtâ Certain, not favour'd with the grace of truth. Sir Val. Doubt'st thou I utter aught but truth? Hero. I doubt Thy wits, thy wisdom, or thy truth. Not mad, Thou art not wiseâif wise, thou speak'st not truth. And sooth to say, thy dress of vanity, Thy looks of wildness, and thy air, assured, Where one who knew propriety would feel Disturbanceâthis abrupt intrusion, which Nor leave, nor introduction, nor acquaintance Can justifyâapprove thee void of truth, Unwise, or mad!âif none of these, a man Of cloddish nature, base and ignorant! Sir Val. Oh! say not cloddish nature! Say not base, Nor ignorant! It is the dignity Of man, that the bright stars invite his mind To soar the empyrean where they sit, Placed infinite beyond terrestrial reach; And scan their uses and their essences,â High argument of his affinity To him that made them, and the immortal light That shall outlast this filmy, shadowy sphere Whereon they look and smile! 'Twas told to me That thou wast perfect fairâI doubted that, For I had found, methought, the paragon Of beauty's wealth in woman! then 'twas said That thou wast wiseâI wish'd thee that, for still, Though oft at fault, in noble house I've lodged Noble inhabitant! 'Twas said again That thou wast goodâthen I believed thee wise, For wisdom should bear goodness, or no fruit! And good and wise, believed thee fairest too, And coveted! Nor come I without leaveâ Thy simple life, eschewing worldly forms, Was pledge for leave! Nor lack I introduction, That honest errand bring to vouch for me. Nor, least of all, acquaintanceâI have known thee Since matured thought, my nature's fondest wish Informing, told it loveliness of soul, Yet more than that of body, forms the woman, And, therewith when abiding, makes full up The highest worth that excellence on earth Amounts toânearest what we hope in Heaven Hero. Friend, dost thou know thou talkest to a worm? Sir Val. A worm! Hero. A mite? Sir Val. A mite! Hero. Nor yet a miteâ A congregate of evils, whereunto The worm and mite are strangers? Sir Val. Evils! Hero. Know'st not That beauty will take cold?âwill have the tooth-ache? Will catch a fever?âthat its peachy cheek Will canker in a night?âthat its sweet lips, Palace of smiles, spasm will compel to change Their garish tenants for uncouth contortions? That its fair dress of prideâits velvet skinâ Humours will spot, discolour?âthat, in brief, It is a thing in value vanishing As fickle merchandise, which rates to-day Enormouslyâthe next, may go a-begging? And, worse than all, that its chief merit lies In wishing, not possessing?âcoveted, Of purchase measurelessâobtain'd, worth nothing! Sir Val. Thou mean'st the beauty that but meets the eye? Hero. I mean the beauty thou alone canst see, And provest thou only see'st. Why, what pains Thou takest with a common piece of clay To set it off! A fine account to turn The bow of God toâmeant for spiritual, And not corporeal useâwith divers tints To clothe thy body! besides lading it With the mine's produceâgems and metalsâproof Far more without concerns thee than within! Oh! that a nature, of immortal reach, Should house its aspirations in a crib Like this poor tiny world! and, taught to look Above the coronets of the fair stars; Go proud with grains of dust and gossamer, The property of things inferior to him, As motes unto the sun! But I forgetâThy errand? Sir Val. Love! Hero. 'Tis clear, thou'rt mad! What! love Whom ne'er thou saw'st before! Sir Val. Nay, pardon me, And let thy patience lend me audience, while I show thee my credentials, on the faith Of which I come. I have seen thee very oft. Hero. Stark mad! Sir Val. Nay, rationalâas rational As reason in its soberest, perfect moodâ Held converse with thee, countless times. Hero. Broke loose From Bedlam! Sir Val. Walk'd and sat with thee. Hero. I trust Thy keeper is at hand! Sir Val. He came with me. Hero. Where is he? Sir Val. Here, although thou see'st him not. My keeper's Love. I have woo'd thee for a month! Hero. Hoa! help! Sir Val. Be not alarm'd. Hero. Nay, touch me not! When didst thou break thy chains? Sir Val. I wear them yet; The subtle ones that self-same beauty forged, Which now I look uponâmost gorgeous dress, But by another worn. Hero. Oh! you have loved One that resembles me. Sir Val. I have. Hero. 'Tis not A fit, then? Sir Val. No; for fits are vanishing. This is a mood like nature's; lasts for life! Enter Clever. Clever. Why didst thou call? I heard thy voice, in fear. Hero. All's well, good Obadiah. Clever. Is it so? Then I may go again. Young man, beware Thou frighten'st not the maiden. We are meek, And offer not offence; but meeting it, As injury will make the worm rebel, We turn, and we are strongâyea, very strong!â Whose wrath, albeit a pebble, hath avail To smite a giant!âtherefore, tempt it not! Umph! [Goes out. Hero. Thou hast known a maiden like me? Sir Val. Yes; I have loved a maid, most like theeâmost unlike; Without, as costly,âbut within, as poor To thee, as penury to affluence. Hero. And didst thou love and woo her for a month, And a defaulter, thus? 'Twas grievous lack Of penetration. Sir Val. Nay, 'twas specious show That valid credit won. Hero. Thou art a man Like all thy worldly class, of shallow mind. Thy heart is in thine eyes! What pleaseth them, Is sure of that. Sir Val. Nay, I had then loved on. Hero. What cured thy love? Sir Val. I saw her in a dance Light nature show. Hero. A dance! Oh! I have heard Of such a thing. An idle pastime! What But folly comes of folly? Do you dance? Sir Val. I do. Hero. What kind of a thing is it? Come, show me! Sir Val. I pray you to excuse me. Hero. Nay, but dance. Sir Val. I pray you, ask me not. Hero. Thou dancest badly? Sir Val. Nay, I have won some credit in the dance. Hero. Then do the thing thou hast won credit by. Sir Val. I cannot. Hero. Friend, thou art ashamed to dance. Sir Val. Nay, not ashamed. Hero. Then dance! Sir Val. 'Twere out of time And place. Hero. What, out of time and place, and to A man of gallantry, to do the thing A lady wishes him; and he the while On sufferance in her presence! I perceive! Thou art in a grave mood, and for a man to dance, And look like Solomon, I must suppose Were more offence to seriousness, than were A cap and bells. Friend, it is very clear Thou canst not dance, and look like a wise manâ Yet thou woo'dst a lady, thou saidst, And cast her off, because she did not dance With gravity! Sir Val. She danced with lightness more Than lightest measure warranted. No thing A modest woman doesâsay that it touches The utmost verge of licenseâbut that cincture, Of better proof than zone of adamant, Its holy and offence-repelling fires, Keeps waving round her, that the libertine, Unwon by honour, yet is tamed by awe! She danced to gladden eyes, whose burning glances Turn thoughts of honest men on flashing swords, On flame at stains wash'd out alone by blood! The empire of her beauty gave a prey To parasites, who love for their own ends, And by their homage shame! Hero. We have talk'd enough. Sir Val. Your pardon! Yet, we have not talk'd at allâ The errand yet untold, that brought me hereâ I would have leave to woo thee. Hero. Thou!âa man Of the vain world! Sir Val. Nay, of no world but thine! Hero. Thou of my world! How comest thou by these gaudsâ Lace, ribbons, tinsel, trinkets, slashesânot To name that most egregious vanity Thou mountest in thy cap, and the poor bird It was purloin'd from wore for use, not show!â Rebuke and lesson to its wiser lord! There's not a portion of thee but bespeaks Ransacking of the earth and seaâand all To recommend thee unto eyes, whose owners, Be they the homeliest, behold thy betters In their own mirrors. Sir Val. I will dress to please The eyes of none but thee. Hero. Thou shouldst be richâ Too rich for modest happiness, and all Beyond is but the name! Riches are bars Prevent us enter Heaven; how, then, be doors On earth to admit us unto aught of Heaven? How many hundreds brings thy rental in? Sir Val. As many as make up a thousand pounds To welcome every quarter. Hero. Poor young man! How much I pity thee! Sir Val. I will reduce My revenue. Hero. Canst thou reduce the wants Thy revenue hath gender'dâfoes to thee, Under the masques of friends? Sir Val. My every want Is now summ'd up in one. Hero. Hast thou a title? How art thou named? Sir Val. Sir Launcelot de Vere. Hero. How wouldst thou bear be call'd plain Launcelot? Thou wouldst not know thyself! We have no titles. Names, being of themselves no part of us, We only value as distinguishing One from another. Stephen, Ephraim, John, Obadiah, Solomon, suffice. All adjuncts else, as Misters, Sirs, Earls, Dukes, We estimate as superfluities. Sir Launcelot de Vere! I neither like Title nor Christian name. More proper far Would Peter fitâor Mark, or John, or Luke, Or Nicodemusânames of men of peace, And sounding passing sweet! Sir Val. The name is mine Thou givest me. Hero. So thou believest now; To-morrow, thou wilt be the former man. Nor must I longer talk with thee; for sweet I own the proffer of thy duty comes, Although by me received mistrustingly. Persist not, friend, or I may wholly doubt What half I would believe;âwhich, if indeed Thou mean'stâand, here, the frankness of a maid Hath overshot her coynessâthou canst prove Hath matter weightier than airy words. Farewell! What shall I call thee? Sir Val. Launcelot. Hero. So soon forgot. Sir Val. Mark, Obadiah, Job, Peter, orâorâI lack the other names. Hero. No matter! These are grateful as the rest, Nor 'mongst them Peter least! What a sweet name Is Peter!âI will call thee Peter, though It be for the last time. [Sighs.] Farewell, friend Peter. Sir Val. Stay! How may I call thee? Hero. Say, Ruth. Sir Val. Farewell, Fair Ruth! Hero. Fair Ruth! So soon forgot again! Friend Ruth, thou ought'st to say. Sir Val. Friend Ruth, farewell! And yet another word! Have I thy leave To come to thee again? Hero. That must depend On how thou com'st. Sir Val. Then sure I come again! Friend Ruth! Hero. Friend Peter? Sir Val. May we not shake hands? Hero. That must depend on how thou shakest hands. Sir Val. Why, how should I shake hands? Hero. Why, soberly. Sir Val. Then soberly, friend Ruth, shake hands with me. Hero. There, that is long enough! Sir Val. One more word yetâ Friend Ruth, may I not kiss thy hand? Hero. Friend Peter! Sir Val. I'll kiss it soberlyâyea, soberly. Farewellâonce moreâfarewell!âOne more.âIt is A banquet, gathers appetite. [Kissing her hand. Enter Clever. Clever. Young man, What dost thou? Sir Val. Nothing. Clever. Yea, a thing that vexes The spirit of the maiden, and to mine Gives much disturbanceâyea, a forward thing, Abomination to the faithfulâyea, Abomination.âGo! [Placing himself between them. Sir Val. Farewell! Clever. Avaunt! Such things become not eyes like hers or mine To look upon.âAvoid! Sir Val. Farewell! I'll come Again! Hero. Then come with more discretion, friend. Clever. Thou hear'stâavoid! Remove thee hence! Begone! Make not a crook, friend, of thy bodyâsay Farewellâdo nothing moreâand go! Sir Val. Farewell! Hero. Farewell! END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âThe Park. Enter Lord Athunree and Felton. Ath. Yes; I desired him to attend me here. Behoves my door and he be strangers, lest Our practices be traced. Want dogs him still, And fits him for my purpose, by the threat Of her pernicious tooth. Yet there's a weakness, I would he had not. Much he loves his child; Which shows his nature is not callous all; Whence oftentimes I dread some start of ruth. But finds he out fair Hero's close retreat, The meagre knave shall fatten. Soft! he's hereâ Well, have you traced her? Enter Lewson. Lew. Yes; she is at Greenwich, Where I and mine abide and famish. Ath. Fool! Not to have guess'd as much, and know she hath A villa there. Resides she by herself? Lew. She does. Ath. Then is she mine. Canst thou obtain Secret admission? Lew. Easily, my lord; Into her chamber-window, which looks out Upon her garden. Ath. It must be done to-night. Lew. Most strangely is she changed. Ath. How? Lew. In her dress, That's now the fashion of that formal sect, Which at all worldly modes exception takes. Ath. Indeed! some plot 's on foot, and must concern Her quarrel with Sir Valentine. To-night, She gives me lodging. Stayâwe must proceed With such exactitude, the sun and dial Shall vary soon as we! I'll write it down. [Writes. 'Sdeath! I must change a word! I'll write it o'er Again, that thou mayst have no scratch to hang Excuse for failure on. There. Be observant To the syllable. Away! Thy greatest hire, For former service, I will double for thee, Succeed'st thou but in this. Lew. Misgive not, sir; I never yet have fail'd you. But, so please you, Some present prompt supply. My children starve! My wife, to find them half a meal a day, Hath worn herself to skin and bone, and now Can drag her limbs no more to forage for them. Their pressing need relieve, and do with me Whate'er thou wilt. Ath. There! Lew. All is noted here, Behoveth me to heed? Ath. No jot forgot. I may rely upon thee? Lew. As on one Whose life is in thy hands. [Goes out. Ath. The cards come round. Fel. I pray you, what intend you? Ath. He obtains Admittance; I am on the watch, without; She is alarm'd; I hear her cry for help; And to her rescue naturally come. I enter how I can, and once within, Shape as I may the restâassured of this, She will accept protection; giving which, I cast what colour on the case I please, Insuring payment full! Fel. Thou art the prince Of plotters! Ath. Thou art no less royal, there. So hold we charge of one another's secrets, Neither is like to break. Enter Eustace and Walsingham Eust. Lord Athunree, I here accuse thee of a murder! and Will undertake to justify myself, At the point of the sword. Hast thou the courage to Abide the trial, whereunto I, now, Demand of thee, thou fixest time and place, For thy defence? Lo, I repeat the charge And challenge tooâThou art a murderer! And I demand thou pay the penalty, Which if I prove defaulter in exacting, I am content to leaguer my own life. For the third time, I charge thee with the deed!â Of felony more capital accuse thee Than ever caitiff on the scaffold paid The forfeit of! A murder,âcowardly! Unparallel'd!âpast human nature savage! Wilt thou confront me?âWilt thou? Canst thou? Darest thou? Ath. Doubt'st thou my answer prompt as thy demand? Eust. Give it, and leave not room for question! Where, And when, shall we the mortal issue try? Ath. To-morrow!âStay!âthat gentleman thy friend? Eust. He is. Ath. He passes then as voucher for thee. Yet I'll prevent miscarriage in the thing Thy heart so earnestly is bent upon, To its deep cost, I fear. There time and place You see are written down. [Writes on the back of the paper he had first written upon. Eust. For this I thank you; That I may thoroughly be quits with you, And all the payment on thy side be due. Ath. Farewell! Thou art young, but yet more rash than young! Eust. I am not rash, but by reflection act As I do now, with hope my arm will prove Stanch as my tongue. Thou art a murderer! [Lord Athuntree and Felton go out. Wal. My fellow-student! Wonder hitherto Hath tied my tongue! Has he a wrong with thee To settle too? Eust. He has! Let's see what time and place He hath appointed? Ha! what's here? Oh, Providence is here! [Aside.] A plot to ensnare, In helpless ruin like to mine, the heart In girlhood still was nearest to my own. Then must I see thee, Hero! Pride must now Give way to love! Occasion calls me hence, More urgent yet than that which brought me hither. Nor must we go together. Question, not; But, at our place of practice, give me meeting An hour at least ere noon. Wal. I shall not fail. [Goes out. Eust. Oh, what a case is mine, to wear the brand I never merited!âto be denounced The child of guilt, that am the daughter freeâ Except the primal all-referring lapseâ Of innocence! To be amerced of that, The loss of which might make offence a thing To be commiserated more than blamedâ For nothing!âSo!âInconstant to him!âSo!â A wanton!âSo!âThe framer of a lie!â He loves me still! I pardon all for that! For that his tongue shall rail at me againâ Pronounce me faithlessâliarâwantonâaught! Aught that I am not, for the blessed Am That still assures him mine! Oh, I but play A novel part! A solitary maid, Herself to vindicate her injured name! No father, brother, friend to plead the cause Of her wrong'd honour, and her baffled love! No champion left her but a woman's arm Back'd by a woman's heart!âyet, trusting these, And to just Heaven appealing, resolute For life or death to meet the mortal strife!â But where is Hero? Does thy friend forget thee, And thou in peril? No! She flies to save thee. [Goes out. SCENE II. âA Room in Hero's House at Greenwich. Enter Hero. Hero. My game the more I play successfully, The less my eagerness to win it grows. 'Tis all but mine, yet thought of victory Sits at my heart so heavy; for defeat To turn up now were respite to me! respite! False gains are poor possessions, bringing not Contentâthe touchstone of true happiness! And yet I punish him! For what? for right? Retaliation of offended wrong! And yet he bears me beyond patience, hard. At once to throw off duty! and my slave To start up my dictator, that ne'er yet Met bended brow of manâin presence too Where vassal homage had awaited me! He should be made to bow! and once become My thorough captive, spurns for spurning take! Yet doth he raise himself, by those high thoughts He breathes of zeal and honour for my sex, The while I sink as coming short thereof! With this regard I fail. I must see nought Except my purposeâby the dread of loss Yet to enhance my value in his eyes, Propound my terms, and to the issue come That shows him foil'd, and me the conqueror! Enter Clever. Clever. Ma'm, he is come! Hero. Then show him in, and mind What we arranged, touching those friends of mine I am to summon from the other room. [Clever goes out. How shall I struggle through the race, wherein I gasp at setting out! Enter Clever, showing in Sir Valentine. Clever. Here is the man That wants to speak with theeâbe careful, for I like his habit better than his looks. He minds me of some child of Satan, who My spirit hath offendedâWatch him, Ruth, And advertise me if he troubleth thee. [Goes out. Hero. Thy business, friend? Sir Val. Dost thou not know it? Hero. Yea! If fits thy purpose, friend, thy habit; grave And goodly must it beâwhat is its shape? Instruction or admonishment, or what? Unfold thee! Be it righteous and discreet, I'll hear it as an humble sister ought. Sir Val. Dost thou not know me? Hero. Yea! that thou art one Amongst the faithfulâbut I know not who That one may be. Sir Val. Not know me, sister Ruth? Hero. Oh! is it you, friend Peter, come again Into a new man changed! Sir Val. So changed for thee! My fortune I've reduced. Made o'er to thee For purposes of heavenly charity! Hero. Made o'er thy fortune? Could I this believe? [Aside. Sir Val. My thousands, lady, have since yesterday To hundreds dwindled, at thy will. If that Contents thee not, but still I seem too rich, Say but the word, the hundreds shrink to tensâ The tens to unitsâthese again to nought, That my fond love may win most rich reward. Hero. I dream'd not of such love! [Aside. Sir Val. My title gone. Hero. Thy title gone! Sir Val. Had it been costlier, More readily it had been thrown away, As to thy wish, whereto it gave offence, A meeter sacrifice! Plain gentleman Is all they rate me now! if that's too high, I'll be plain yeoman, for thy gentle sake; If that, low hind! aught lady, aught! to please The wise desires, are guardians to thy love! Hero. His title likewise gone! I have o'ershot My mark! I'll stop!âToo lateâI must go on!â Thy work's not yet complete. Our sect, thou know'st, Prohibits marriage, save amongst its own; To number thee with whom, if thou inclinest To recommend thee, it behoves thee win Some brother's, sister's, wordâsuch are at handâ Wilt thou submit thee to their scrutiny? Sir Val. At once! Hero. But mind, whate'er they may remark, Thou takest in silenceâeven in good part. It will be scandal to me else, because Of entertaining thee. Sir Val. Thy will 's my law. [Hero rings. Enter Clever. Clever. Hath he misdone? Am I to put him forth? Hero. No; brother Ephraim I wish to see, And with him sister Grace. Clever. They saw the man Ascend the steps, and when he was let in, They oped the door themselves, and vanishÃ©d! Thereto advised by his forbidding looks. Friend Ruth, he's poison to thee. Yesterday I lost much grace accompanying him From London unto Greenwich, so he vex'd My spirit by the lightness of his gait, And mortified me, as he drew the eyes Of flaunting damsels on him! To reform him Is hopeless, for the more that I admonish'd, The more did he offend; till scandalized Beyond endurance e'en of my meek spirit, I waver'd between option to stand still And let him on alone, or run and leave him. Observe moreover he's a man of wrath,â Look at him! He could eat me upâyea, eat me Like to a ravening lion a poor lamb! Ne'er judged I looks of manâif inwardly He does not bite his lips! Be sure he swears! Yea, he blasphemeth!âGet him from thy doors! Eject him from them! Into the highway with him! Heed not if night or dayâin sun or rainâ Or lose thy place among the faithful, Ruth! Umph! [Goes out. Hero. They reject theeâyea, thou see'st they do! Yea, they reject thee! Sir Val. Do not thou the same! Oh, let me talk to thee in my soul's speechâ List! I have staked my life on winning thee! Not in my own breath, but in thine I live! My portion in the sun, the earth, and all The affluence from their copartnery Derived, I have made o'er to thee, nor now Except by thy vouchsafing can enjoy! Am I to live or die? Nay, think before Thou speak'st, and those fair thoughts to council call, Yet richer than the sumptuous palace which They make their proud sojourn! So like to Heaven, Hast not its ruth, that makes us daily bless Its governance? Thou hast!âand as thou hast, Let it beam down its influence on me, And save thy worshipper! Thou lett'st me kneelâ Sure thenâO! sure I do not kneel in vain. Hero. Rise up! These proofs of honest passion quite Confound me. [Aside Sir Val. Hear me! O, the world! the world, That's made up of two hearts! That is the sun It moves around! There is the verdure! There The flower! the fruit! The spring and autumn field, Which in the reaping grows! the mine that, work'd, Accumulates in richesâever free From influences of the changing stars, Or aught, save that which sits above them higher Than they above the globe!âCome! make with me E'en such a heavenly world. Hero. Beseech thee, rise! Sir Val. In hope? Hero. In hope! What did I say? Sir Val. Thou saidstâ Thou badest me rise in hope. [Rises.] Thy heart is moved. Hero. 'Tis touch'd. Sir Val. And nothing more? Hero. Perhaps a little. Sir Val. How may I call that little? what's its nameâ If haply of the kind I'd have it be, 'Gainst all I've thrown away, and ten times more, I'd set itâLady, tell me, what's its name? Oh, deal magnanimously with me, nor What 'tis not wrong to feel, when thou canst feel it, Believe 'tis wrong to speak! Frankly! couldst love me? Hero. Frankly, I could. Sir Val. Once more, be frankâand dost thou? Hero. Frankly, I do. Sir Val. I said, âonce more be frank,ââ Yet must I say once more be frank again. Hero. And if thou dost, I will be frank again. Sir Val. Wilt take me for thy husband? Hero. There's my hand, If no impediment forbids thee, clasp it. Sir Val. None. Hero. SoftâI'll do it! 'Twill be a sweet revenge! [Aside. A thought has struck me. Thou hast loved a damsel, My likeness it should seemâand one know I, Who, to the vision, so resembles me, In her I see myself; nor can the ear That hears us, well determine which is which, In pitch and tone our voices so are one. The damsel thou affectedst may be sheâ Her name is Hero Sutton. Sir Val. 'Tis the same. Hero. Another thought now strikes me. Is the name Thou gavest to me thy real one? Alas! Thy colour mounteth! It is clear! Thou art Sir Valentine de Grey? Alas! alas! Your leave to be alone! Sir Val. Are you not well? Hero. O, yes; I'm very well. Good e'en! Quite well! Well as a woman can be, when she finds, Too late, she rashly gave her heart away To one, whose value for the gift will be, Soon as he proves 'tis his, to bid her keep it. Sir Val. To bid her keep it! Hero. As Hero Sutton rues! Sir Val. She never gave Her heart to me! Hero. She did! you know not when A woman gives away her heart! At times She knows it not herself! Insensibly It goes from her! She thinks she hath it stillâ If she reflectsâwhile smoothly runs the course Of wooing; but if haply comes a checkâ An irrecoverableâfinal oneâ Aghastâforlornâshe starts, to find it lost, And with it, all the world! Sir Val. No maid could love, And act as she. Hero. How did she act? Sir Val. I told thee. She danced to please a libertine, and pain A man of honourâone who worshipp'd her. Hero. She danced to please no man but thee! Your eyes, She thought upon her, did alone inspire her In the measure. Thorough conquest of the heart, She thought was all but hers, she hoped to make; And so, with all her soul endeavouring, She lost it all, and with it all herself! Sir Val. If she had told me thisâ Hero. If she had told! When, pray thee?âwhere? or how?âdidst name a place, Or time, to hear her vindicate herself? Didst even hint it to her? In a breath, You doubted, tried, condemn'd, and sentenced; nor 'Fore witnesses didst pity her to spare her! They should beware, who charges lay in love, On solid grounds they make them! for, there are hearts So proudly fond, that, wrong them, there, they'll break Or ever they will stoop to right themselves. Much such a one is hers; and yet, with all Her prideâfor strong as that, more strong her loveâ She trusts to win thee still. Sir Val. To win me still! She gave me up, without a sigh or word. Hero. So had I given thee up, had I been sheâ And yet I love thee. Sir Val. See me at thy feet! Hero. I can't, with thought how thou hast knelt at hers. Sir Val. Nay, hear me, but in pity. Hero. She in pity Heard thee! and much it profited her!âmuch! She now, it seems, may sue! Sir Val. I swear to thee Eternal constancy! Hero. Thy witnesses, Thy oaths to her! Sir Val. Where are the smiles just now That beam'd upon me? Hero. Quench'd by Hero's tears. Sir Val. By Hero's tears! She never wept for me! Hero. She show'd thee not her tears; but what of that? Her eyes might rain, and thou not see a drop. I know they did so. Sir Val. Let me hold thy hand. Hero. Never, till her thou hast wrong'd, thou offerest To right. The world return to, thou wouldst quit It seems for me. Resume its habit; hie To Hero Sutton's, whom I shall advise To look for thee to-morrow eve. Repeat What I have said to thee. If she denies What I aver, be free to come to me, And welcome too! If she acknowledges, The hand of her, whose heart thou hast purloin'd, Behoves thee ask and take Sir Val. Yet hear me! Hero. Nay! These are the terms on which we break or meet. Sir Val. If she rejects me? Hero. Then will Ruth be thine. Sir Val. If she accepts me? Hero. Then, still thine, Ruth dies! [They go out severally. SCENE III. âAn Ante-Room leading into Hero's Chamber in the same house. Enter Lewson, from the Window. Lew. Safe! Safe!âall silent! What has turn'd my feet From flesh to lead? My body, which to bear Their function is, appears to drag them on. I wont not thus to feel. Ferrying across From Limehouse now, I saved a drowning man. Twice had he sunk in sight of his young brood, That with their dam kept fluttering on the shore. O, how they bless'd me! while the standers by Echoed them, and to all inquirers said, That ask'd who saved him, âYonder's the good man!â And I afoot to do an evil act! Another should have saved him! Let it pass! Is this her chamber? No, her dressing-room. Ay, here's her woman's gear. What holds this case? Her paint, I'll warrantâher cosmeticsâaught To give another skin; they're ne'er content With nature's; patches, perfumes, dentifrice! A book?âI'll wager one she durst not show! A Bible! Umph! Strange reading that, methinks, For a fine lady! Here's a leaf turn'd down; What says the place? It seems to talk to me! I'll read no further! Soâwhat have we here? Her letters! Excellent! Her letters!ânow To see how they can look and talk the saint, And play the sinner, still! A hundred pounds, The first is an amour!âA wretch's prayer For helpâherself and children without food For two whole days! What, baggage! beg ere rob? Wait for a thaw, and see thy little ones Congeal to death i' the icy world!âWith the thought, I have a feeling how the tiger's fangs Rend for her cubs the prey!âWhat alms didst hope Her ladyship would give?âWhat would suffice The dressing of her gown she wears a night And casts aside, for foul! What's hereâis this Her answerâor the copy on't? Indeed! Ay, when she gives she gives! She seems to think That poverty, like plenty, is made up Of flesh and blood. There's food for dam and whelps For a whole weekâThe letter's to my wife! She dined to-day,âfall to'tâfall to'tâthy brood May gorge them now! Methinks I see them feed! Heaven bless her!âWhat! Heaven bless her, did I say? Then, what do I do here? No more of this! I've work to do, chimes not with thoughts like these. No more on't! Footsteps!âSoâBeast to thy lair. [Conceals himself. Enter Hero; she goes to the window, and looks out. Hero. Whether mine eye with a new spirit sees, Or nature is grown lovelier, I know not; But ne'er, methinks, was sunset half so sweet! He's down, and yet his glory still appears, Like to the memory of a well-spent life, That's golden to the last, and when 'tis o'er, Shines in the witnesses it leaves behind. They say, a ruddy sunset a fair day! Oh! may it be a day without a cloud, Which of my fate beholds the clearing up; That I may quote it, ever, as a sign Of sincere fortune, often as I say Was ever day so bright! How calm is allâ How calm am I!âWould every breast I knew Were lodge to heart so tranquil,âThere was oneâ A most strange history! Is she alive, Or dead? [Eustace appears at the window.] Who's there? Eust. [Entering.] A friend! Hero. Help! Eust. Hush! I come For safety! Hero. To thyself? Eust. To thee! Look here,â Lest I should miss thee, I prepared this scroll. More brief 'twill tell my errand, than my tongue Could do't. Hero. [Reads.] Lord Athunree!âThis very night! My house beset!âmyself by force abstracted! Eust. If thou hast kindred in the neighbourhood, Or friend thou canst rely upon, forthwith Of thy immediate danger caution them, By hands you can confide inâfor my pains, I pray you pay me with the only audience Of some poor moments, when I'll take my leave. Hero. [To herself.] I need not fear him! On his o'ercast brow 'Tis grief, not guilt, that lowers.âA minute's patience. I shall rejoin you. [Goes out. Eust. Thou art happy, Hero, And she that loves thee, weepsâbut not that thou Art happy! Thy fair fortune is the likeness Of what was once my own! It is a face Reminds me of a valued friend that's lost, And which I bless, the while it makes me weep! Hero. [Re-entering.] What you advised, I've doneâand now your pleasure? Eust. Have I your leave, I'll sit. I've used some hasteâ Am somewhat out of breathâI thank you! So! Pray you be seated, too. You've had your share Of friends?âYour 'haviour's of the winning kind, That goodness sweetens!âYou are frankâYou love Another's weal more than you envy itâ And such a one makes friends.â'Mongst those you've found, You surely some must miss, else was your fate Past earthly blessing happy? Hero. I've lost friends. Eust. Byâdeath? Hero. By death. Eust. And any by misfortune? Hero. Misfortune!âNo, not any. Eust. [Rising.] What!ânot one? Good night! Hero. What mean you? Do you take me for A season friend, no stancher than the bird, Whose time the sun appoints to come and go, And's with us when 'tis summer?âOh, you wrong me! What!âI to love, as loves that summer bird The land he makes his gay sojourning in, My friend, because 'tis leaf and blossom time! Indeed you wrong me!âKnew I, at this moment, One cheek I loved, was beggar'd of its smilesâ Not one left to itâI vow to thee, the nextâ If back'd my power my will, before the nextâ My own should be its neighbour.âOh! how much You wrong me! Eust. Glad I am I've done thee wrongâ In sooth, I amâand yet I wrong'd thee not, I only miss'd thy meaning! Hadst not a friend Misfortune lost thee?ânot that thou shunnedst her, But that her heavy and most strange affliction To thee and all her sex forbade her access? Hero. A friend?âa sister! What a fate was hers! Of all I valued, she the being was I least could measure worth with. Of all grace, The pattern was sheâperson, features, mind, Heart, everything, as nature had essay'd To frame a work which none might find a flaw in! And yet 'tis said, she fellâand if she did, Let none be sure they'll stand! She couldn't fall! There's such a thing as purity on earth, And if she fell, there could be no such thing! She didn't fall!âNo! No!âI knew her, or I never knew myself! Virtue with her Was not a lesson we must con before 'Tis learn'd by heart; it was a portion of her, Much as her stature, feature, shape, or voice, Which, saving nature's, hand ne'er gave to her. She has been outraged, slander'dâaughtâbut lost! She could not fallâshe did notâcould not fall! What ails thee? Eust. He that sets a banquet down To famish'd lips, serves poison, and not meat, For, ten to one, the greedy guest will die. Yet blesses he the host, as I bless thee, That spread'st for me this feast! Hero. This feast; What feast? Move not thy lips thus impotently, or I'll think thou diest indeed! What feast dost mean? Is't one the heart makes? 'TisâThine eyes discourse Language 'twould tax a hundred tongues to speak! In wonder's name, who art thou? Say thou'rt not What thou appear'st, I'll tell thee who thou art! Could I not do't?âCould I not?âHelen?âWhat? Well?âAm I right?âIf ever thou valuedst The homage of this breast, ne'er fear to claim it! 'Tis thine!âall!âall!âdemand it!âtake it!âcome!â 'Tis thine as e'er it was!âWell? Eust. [Rising, but unable from emotion, to advance.] Hero! Hero. Nay, I'll bring it to thee, then! That's rightâweep on! My sweet!âmy dear! my poor! my wrong'd one!âyes, Wrong'dâwrong'dâI say't again! Thou need'st not speak, Thou hast not strengthâthou'lt sleep with me to-night?â To-morrow for thy story. Helen. Nay, to-night. I'm more myself again!âLet it be soâ Sit down a while. How hast thou been, my Hero Hero. Well, sweet, most well! Helen. Now by the love Thou bear'st me, interrupt me not; but hear My story out. Thou hast been told, that from A roof which shelters aught but innocence, In company with one, whom innocence, That would be safe, should shun; i' the face of day, Thy friend was seen to issue. Thither, by A forgÃ©d tale of misery, alone She was decoy'dâexposed to outrage thereâ Rescued by himâby him conducted thenceâ Met in the street ere well her foot had left The thresholdâcountenance refused her tale By him that could have vouch'd its truthâby him Her tale discredited, whose credence was Life! happiness! all but honour! In a word, Her virtue blasted, that had ne'er known blightâ Denounced as canker'dârottenâwhile was sound As thy own, Hero!âeven, as thy own! Hero. I know't. Helen. You know't? Alas, you know it notâyou think itâ Think it in the teeth of damning fact. It is Your love!âyour charity! An almsâan almsâ Is all that friend so kind as even thou Can render now to HelenâYet I'll be righted! But fare thee wellâ'tis late! Hero. You'll stay with me? Helen. What! let me press thy pure sheets, Hero, with A tainted name? How I have wrong'd thee!âWouldst Believe't? I once came to thy doorâbut there I stopp'd. I was not wont to ask for leave To enter it, and I must ask for't now! I left thy door againâthe certainty To see it never ope thy friend preferr'd To but the chance to see it shut upon her! Hero. To but the chance to see it shut on thee! What warrant ever gave I for such chance? Oh! had it wider, freer oped than e'er, It only had anticipated what Its mistress' arms had doneâwhat now they do! You shall not leaveânay, in sooth you shall not! Helen. In this attire, think, should I here be seenâ Hero. I'll think of nought, but that thou now art here. But that thou here shalt stay. Thou canst be gone At dawn. Thou know'st a thousand things I have To ask of theeâhow we shall meet again?â Where I shall find thee?âwhat thy projects areâ Deny me not, I pray thee! 'Twill but make The greater beggar of meâCome!âYou can, You mustâyou willâthis is my chamberâCome! [They go out. Lew. [Entering in disorder.] I cannot do't! Heaven 's on the watch against it! 'Tis said it guards the good, and if it does, Its spirits sure are hereâThey are!âor why This fearful awe come over me? I feel As eyes were on me, that I cannot seeâ Above me, lips that speak but are unheardâ And hands around me, with a thousand times The power of flesh and blood, though sightless as The air! Heaven will not have it beâIt sets Before mine eyes, the fruit of what I've doneâ To warn me back from what I've come to do. That hapless maiden owes her injured name To me! I was the instrument to ruin her! To fix on her the wanton's brand, that ne'er In thought it seems incurr'd the wanton's stain! To damn in this world, what i' the next is blest Oh! heavy sinâGo sin no more! How's this? Go sin no more! So said the book to me. Then Heaven cares for sinners, it should seem! O blessed book! I'll go and sin no more! The chime! It lacks a quarter of an hourâ The very clock would save me. Was't the hour, They'd have me in their fearful toils again! Away! away! speed feet, while ye are free, Softly and swiftâthe minutes fly! Away! [Exit. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âHero's Town House. Enter Sir William Sutton and Emily. Sir Wil. What! Helen Mowbray come to life again? Emily. 'Tis even so! and metamorphosed as You ne'er would dream. But pray you, use despatch. On the reverse of this she gave your niece, And which, unthinkingly, no doubt, was given To her, 'tis clear some mortal work 's on handâ For here are time, and place, and weapon named, Upon the part of base Lord Athunree. There yet is time! Prevent it, while you may! Sir Wil. [Rings the bell. Attendant enters.] Hark, sir! Take charge of this, and have it straight Put into execution by the chief O' the city officersâLook to it well! And now, what means this full assembly call'd Of friends and relatives, to feast with Hero? Emily. I must not tellâbut guess. Sir Wil. I cannot guess The shapes particular of women's fancies, Especially in one of Hero's vein. Retains she her disguise? Emily. No; casts it offâ And with it, habit, more a part of her. She is changed beyond belief. Sir Wil. Not my belief, When I shall see it. Emily. I must hie to her, And set her mind at rest on this affair, Touching her friend, which chance reveal'd to her, In time, I trust, the issue to prevent. You have given order they be hither brought? Sir Wil. I have. Where's Hero? Emily. In the library, In earnest converse still with that strange man, Who pray'd an audience with her, and I think, Brought news that has surprised her. Dinner-time Will see an end and clearing up of all. [They go out severally. SCENE II. âThe Outskirts of London. Enter Walsingham and Helen (still in the disguise of Eustace). Wal. Not yet arrived! Helen. 'Tis 'fore the time. Wal. How feel you? Helen. Collected, and myself. Wal. You look so. Clear Your 'haviour, as this day of trial only The ordinary mate of yesterday, You'll win! Helen. I shall!âI am resolved to win. Wal. Show me thy sword. Helen. I cannot draw it, but My life must follow. Wal. How? Helen. It is my heartâ This which I wear, is nothing. Call it steel, 'Tis steel!âa straw, it even is a straw! Its stamina not lodging in itself, But in the heart that wields it. Wal. This is calmness Upon the eve of combat! Helen. Walsingham, There is a kind of nature that clears up The instant it confronts a trying thing. In common evils, hesitates and fears; In ills of moment, shows sedate resolve. Wal. Why, that is woman's proper contradiction. Helen. It passes for't; but sometimes 'bides in man, Not therein less of his high caste deserving, Though so resembling woman! Think'st not so? Wal. Assuredly. Helen. You see this mood is mine, Nor was I on my guard to let it outâ 'Twill lose me credit with you. Best have pass'd For Sir Redoubtable any day o' the year! You more had thought of me. Wal. No! Helen. You say I am calm? I am soâthat is, as to the issue of This mortal meetingâfor 'tis mortal!âbut I have a trouble, andâwilt thou believe meâ 'Tis touching thee!âIt grieves me, Walsingham, To leave thee an abusÃ©d man behind me! What late thou told'st me I have ponder'd well, And thereon founded arguments, methinks, More solid, than I urged on you before. They are hereâyour poor friend's legacy to you! [Gives a paper. Stop!âYou're about to speakâDon't speak as yet. If I should fall, you pledge your gentle word, My body you will have direct convey'd Unto the lady's I have herein named. [Gives another paper. Deliver'd to her custodyâher own! Nor until then, one fastening, fold, loop, thread O' the vesture, thou wilt suffer be disturb'dâ No, not to search, or probe, or stanch a wound, Or settle whether I'm alive or dead, Or anything! To this, thou pledgest thee? Wal. Dear boy, I do! Helen. Another thingâ Wal. What is't? Thou pausest, as in doubt I'll grant it thee. Whate'er it be, I swear to do it. Helen. Ha! Then hast thou set my heart indeed at rest! Mind, thou hast sworn to do't. Revenge me not! That comprehendeth all! Don't speak again, Till I have done, quite done. Thou lovest me? Wal. I do. Helen. How much? Wal. As never man before! Helen. Speak not of love gone by, but present love. With those thou lovest now, how rates thy love? Wal. As first. Helen. As first of all? Wal. Of all! Helen. All friends? Not one before me? Wal. No! Helen. Not one? Wal. Not one! Helen. And all love told? Wal. All loveâbut love itself! Helen. Shake hands!âWe'll say good bye before they come, Lest there arrive occasion, and no time; Good bye!âOh, happy women, that are friends! They may embraceâmen cannot do so. Wal. Yes, When they are brothers. Helen. Feel'st thou as my brother? I feel as I were thine. Wal. My boy! my boy; [Embracing Helen. Heaven!âbut thou faint'st! Helen. No!âAre they coming!âHeaven Reward thee, for thy precious love of me! They are at handâGood bye! Wal. Show me thy sword! 'Tis somewhat longer, I believe, than mine, And I would try the depth of yonder stream, In case we need to wade it. [Goes out, and returns without the sword. It has slipp'd, And gone down to the bottom!âBoy, your quarrel's mine; To humour thee, alone, I gave consent To second thee. What!âStand, aside, with broad And lusty breast and sinewy arm, and see Thy stripling form the deadly point oppose, In the athletic villain's practised hand; Instead of grasping thee with loving force, Like to a doting father his boy-son, Or elder brother his dear younger one, Taking thy place, and swinging thee away! No, boy! Before thy young veins part a drop Of their rich streams, my channels shall run dry! Helen. Is this fair, Walsingham? Wal. Yet, hear me on! I find I could not live without thee; so Guarding thy life I but protect my own. That's fairâThat's rationalâThat's sound in nature! Want'st further reason?âI will give it theeâ Thou art like her! Helen. Whom? Wal. Boy, hast thou read my soulâ Have I turn'd o'er its every page to theeâ Love, hate, hope, doubt, possession, loss, bliss, pain, Contentment and despairâand in each one Shown thee one all-pervading cause enwrit, For nothing? Whom could I compare thee to, But herâthe heroine of my sad story? Whom much thy face resembles! Hast thou never Remark'd me gazing in abstraction on thee, As though, upon perusal of thy features, While seem'd mine eye intent, my soul was poring Upon some other thing?âI have done it oftâ Will do it once again! Your eyes are hers, In form and hue, but sunk; a darkness too, Not heavy, yet enough to make a cloud, Sitsânot disparagingly thoughâ'neath thine; Hers were two starry brilliants, set in pearl! The outline of the nose is quite the same, But that of thine is sharperâ'tis thy sex. The mouth is very likeâoh, very like! But there's a touchâa somewhat deep one tooâ Of bitterness.âThe cast of hers was sweetness, Enlocking full content. The cheek is not At all alike!â'tis high; and lank below; And sallowânot a dimplÃ© in'tâall contrast To the rich flower'd and velvet lawn of hers. But though thou art not she, entireâthou art Enough of her to make me love thee, boy! With such a brother-love, as brother, never, I dare be bound, for brother felt before! I spoke not of thy hairâIt is a wood Run wild compared to hers, and thrice as deep I' the shadeâYet, you are very like her!âquite Enough, to make me pour my heart's blood out As water, for thy sake!âThey are at hand! Helen. Then let me be at least thy sword-bearer; And when thou need'st the steel, I'll keep the sheath Which in thy motions would embarrass thee! Wal. Take it, and thank thee! Enter Lord Athunree and Felton. Ath. We are late for you, sirs; But not, I think, for time. Wal. You are in time. Helen. Draw off, till, with his second, I arrange Preliminariesâwhich I know are wont, In questions of this kind. What we decide, I shall possess you of; and then proceed. Sir, let us speak. You know me, principal. My place my second would, perforce, usurp. Permit him not, as you're a gentleman! You see he is unarm'dâyour rapier draw, When I draw this, and keep him well aloof. You promise this? Fel. I do! [Aside.] It keeps the odds Upon our side! Helen. [Drawing.] Lord Athunree, I am ready! Fel. [Drawing and opposing Walsingham.] Stand back, sir, at your peril! Wal. Ha!âthe boy Has baffled, and outwitted me! [Advances. Fel. Stand back! I bar all interruption to the game We are summon'd here to play. Wal. A coward act, To draw upon a naked man! Fel. My lord! Why draw you not and he his weapon out? Proceed, my lord, at once! Ath. Before I do, I ask, and I must learn, in name of whom The urchin has arraign'd and challenged me. I fight not, till I know upon what cause. Helen. The cause of Helen Mowbray! Wal. Drop your hand, And let me pass!âor sure as that's a sword My heart is on your point! Ath. Spite of thyself, Another minute grant I thee to live. I will not draw, until I know thy name. Helen. Mowbray! Ath. Her brother? Helen. Anything you please, Caitiff without a parallel in crime! Wal. A brother!âHold! Lord Athunree! Look, sir, [To Felton. A moment give I thee, to take thy choice 'Twixt murdering me, or suffering to pass! Why, what care I for life! [Rushes upon Felton, and wrests the sword from him. At the same moment, Officers and Servants enter. First Officer. Hold! Stop!âProceed At your peril! You are all our prisoners, sirs; Sir William Sutton's warrant makes you so, Which here I show to you. Surrender, then, And to his niece's bear us company. [They all go out. Walsingham and Helen last, who stop a litle behind the rest. Wal. Thou half hast kill'd me, boy! How couldst thou do so! Or keep from one, who loved thee as I do, A secret like to this? Her brotherâso! Her brother!âI shall love thee better stillâ And better yetâyet not so well as her! [They follow. SCENE III. âThe Street. Enter Sir Valentine. Sir Val. Spite of my failing heart, thus far I've come With love to urge me, love to waive me back. My duty tender'd, fortune made or lostâ Not tender'd, absolutely lostâno chance Permitted me to win! 'Tis Hero's form With the fair essenceâmatch for thing so fair!â To Hero's form, without! It is a whole, Past calculation rich, against a part, And that the poorestâyet consummate rich, And I must play for both, or neither win! Or winning one, the other quite forego! It cannot be she loves me! Hero love me! A prideful pleasure kindles at the thoughtâ But comes the gentle Ruth, and puts it out With genial brightness of bland nature, as The sun a little fire. O sun most fair, I richer were ne'er to have known thy light Than knowing it to lose it. Ne'er did man Draw lots with chances more opposed than mine. A little moment I am made or lost; Lost past retrievingâpast addition made! Then must I, like a desperate gamester, on! Throw fear of loss asideâthough loss of allâ And think of nothing but the chance of gain That makes me rich for life!âpast affluence! [Goes out. SCENE LAST. âA Room in Hero's House. Sir William Sutton seated in the centreâWalsingham, Helen, Lord Athunree, Felton, Officers, &amp;c. Sir Wil. Lord Athunree, charged with intent thou stand'st To break the peace of our right sovereign lord The king. What answer'st? Or refusest To plead?âIs this thy hand?âWilt answer that? Whose'er it is, it is a villain's, lord! For the same writer that arranged a fray Had plann'd a felonyâin danger put A lady's jewelry, so rich to herâ Not all the caskets of the proudest line Of noble dames, pour'd out into one heap, Could make a blaze to match it! Ath. [Aside.] Curse my haste For such remissness, on the back to write Of the instructions first I pencill'd down To give the caitiff wretchâwhose guess'd miscarriage Is now accounted for! Sir Wil. Lord Athunree, How say you? Ath. For the combat you have marr'd, My silence or denial nought avails. You found me in the act. The challenger You need to seek elsewhere.âI am not he. Wal. Sir William, he says right.âHe challenged not; But he such provocation gave, as makes The challenger more the challenged.âHe had stain'd A lady's credit, bringing it to naught, Or causing it to pass for nothing more; Which trespass, capital, her brother hereâ In form a stripling, but in mind a manâ Indeed demanded reparation for, Which to exact, my arm assay'd, but fail'dâ For I had woo'd, and won, and, as I thought, Alone engaged the maid. Sir William, try, If from that sacred seat of justice, voice Of solemn adjuration can avail To bring the truth to lightâfirst, if the maid Fellâthe knowledge he, alone, of the truth, Possessing. Sir Wil. No, sir! Another Can vouch she never fell! Wal. She never fell? O, ponder what you say!âNot rashlyâO, Not rashly raise a wretch from the abyss Into the light, to cast him in again On darkness heaving darkness! Now, I faint With the day-flood that seems to burst upon me! I say, âthat seems,â for such transition mocks The doting of belief!âor heard I right? Or knew'st thou what thou saidst? or, knowing it, Knew'st thou didst speak on grounds of solid footing, Something akin to rock?âIt should be rock Itself, to bear the fabric thou dost raise Against the sea of doubts that surges on it! O did she never fall? Did love itself Take sides with hate to do her hateful wrong? To blast herâto abandon herâand leave her A prey to haggard fortuneâdeath or madness? Sir Wil. Collect thyself, and further audience lend, Or bid me hold my tongue. The maiden lives. Wal. Lives? Lives? Is innocent, perhaps, and loves; O does she? Sir Wil. Yes. Wal. Thou seem'st to know what makes My all, or naught of being! Innocent, And lives and loves? Ath. First prove her innocent. Sir Wil. He cannot! what of that?âAnother can! Ath. Produce that other. [Sir William beckonsâLewson enters. Lew. Here he is. Ath. Betrayed! Wal. He hath confess'dâtake notice all! The lips That blurr'd fair Helen's name hath oped themselves, To damn themselves, and do the maiden right! Sir Wil. No need confession from that riven wretch! To that abhorrÃ©d house thou saw'st her quit, A letter, as from one she knew and loved, In mortal strait enticed her. There, assail'd With show of violence from this same man, That lord premeditated succour brought her, The whole his foul contrivance! You may leave! You are known!âWhat penalty the law awards For such default, be sure, shall be exacted! Ath. Exacted? I defy you! Do your worst! [Goes out. [Helen swooning, is caught by Walsingham. Sir Wil. Look to thy mistress, Walsingham. Wal. Where is she?â I nothing see except this fainting boy, Whom help me to restore. Sir Wil. To wake him up, Breathe in his ear the name thou lovest most! Throw back those ebon clusters thoroughly, And consciousness will start upon thee straight, Thou never dream'dst of, and thou shalt confess That love, howe'er it hath a jealous eye, Hath not a piercing one. Wal. Herself!âmy own! My sweet!âmy idolized!âmy innocent Helen!âher eyelids quiverâHelen! Helen! They ope! Dost thou not know me, love? Revive! Die not away again! Core of my life! Helenâmy gentle one! My patient one! My faithful one, unwarp'd by rudest strain! My loving one!âMore lovingâyes, I say it That love thee bestâmore loving yet than loved! Look at me! Answer me! This semblance but Of death, is death itself to me! 'Tis Iâ 'Tis Walsingham!â'Tis Iârepentingly, Humbly, imploring thee to speak to him, To look upon himâpity him!âforgive him! Helen. I love thee, Walsingham. Have all thou ask'st In that one little word! [They retire. Sir Valentine enters. Sir Wil. Sir Valentine! Sir Val. The same, Sir William Sutton. Sir Wil. You are welcome. Sir Val. In strait where things like life and death depend, Suspense is but the rackâI'll know my fate! Sir William Sutton, I am come to crave An audience of your niece. Sir Wil. Apprise my niece Sir Valentine de Grey would speak with her. Sir Val. At thought of sight of that proud form again, Old motions in me stirâbut only stir. Come thought of Ruthâthey are, at once, at rest! Hero enters, most magnificently attired. O what a tower of grace and loveliness, And stateliness, and absolute command, She bursts upon mine eyes! Were't tenanted As I would have it! Hero. Well, Sir Valentine! Your will? Sir Val. I come a promise to redeem, Thou'lt think most strange, as I do, though I made it. A suit I have, the gain or loss of which Depends on thee, although to thee not pleaded! Shall I be pardon'd, who, against my will, Past sufferance presume? Hero. Not mine! Say on. Sir Val. It is the voice of Ruth! I wonder not At thatâbut breathing Ruth's benignity! Hero. Shall I entreat thee say thy wish? Sir Val. More bland The accents yet! Can Ruth have told me right, And does she love me? Hero. Sir, 'tis painful to me To mark such hesitation, when, to have, You only have to ask; and, asking, do A pleasureâgiving leave to pleasure you. Sir Val. [Aside.] No strain hath love, if this be not its mood. I win her, and am lost! Yet lose with gain! Sir Wil. My niece awaits your question. Hero. Uncle, peace. Give him his timeâthe measure on't his will! To look for pleasure is itself a pleasure. But half they feast who to a feast sit down The moment it is named. Say, that he wait An hour, why then, so much I banquet more, And yet fall to with relish. Sir Val. O such words To fall from Hero's lips a month before! Come certainty, whate'er along with it! Dost thou affect me? Hero. Yes, Sir Valentine. Sir Val. Wilt take me for thy husband? Hero. Yes, again. Sir Val. Good bye, sweet Ruth! Hero. Strange welcome this! Sir Val. Good bye To sweet content of modest happiness! Lady, my title 's gone! Hero. For that receive More hearty welcome than thou gav'st to me. Sir Val. My fortune dwindled. Hero. As it sinks, you rise. For that receive more hearty welcome yet. Sir Val. My tastes are alter'd. Hero. Tell me what their kind, They shall be mineâwhate'er thy taste, rank, state, My state, my rank, my tastes, shall be the same! Sir Val. Then must we wed.âO for that plumed tiar, The simple hood!âthat costly lace, the coif Close-pinn'd and modestâclear!âthat gorgeous dress, The gown embroider'd with humility! Hero. They are donn'd at thy command, and these cast off. Sir Val. And canst thou, too, the vesture of the mind That made thee cherish these, cast off? Hero. I can! Hard things which love cannot for love perform. Sir Val. Such bounty should enrich.âAlas! for me, Who, spite of all its granting, must be poor. Clever. [Entering.] Friend Ruth, the dinner waits.âFriend Peter here! And to the world, like thee, gone back again! Then change of gear for me! Bold serving-man, Who would be other than his betters are! No more, friend Obadiahâknow me hence For Master Clever, name and nature one! Sir Val. Have I but dreamt 'tis night, and is it day! A masque is it, I have been acting in, And known it not? Canst thou be both, yet one? Is Ruth but HeroâHero none but Ruth? Then welcome Hero for the sake of Ruth, And Ruth more welcome yet for Hero's sake! And is it so?âor does the fable end In cold return to dull reality? Hero. No; in reality that's born of it And is its fairer likeness!âreal grown What first was only seeming. I have become The part, I lately play'd; the thing I was Before, have ceased to be! Such virtue hath The only show of virtue! For which change Thy noble nature do I thank, although Perhaps, with more than prudent jealousy, Exacting; and precipitate, where patience Might well have counsell'd pause. With Hero's form, Take Ruth's contentment and humilityâ Their dress, whate'er your love would have it be! But here is one unchanged, nor needing change, [To Helen. Except where seeming goes for next to naught! My Helen! thou art happy now! Helen. I am! Wal. And I, that scarce deserve my happiness! But what shall make me misbeliever hence? How could I doubt thee! Strong appearances By stronger vouchers back'd, it was, that made me. But that detected nowâand these explain'dâ Thy virtue rises like a pyramid I wonder aught could hide!âA life of trust Shall for a season of misgiving pay thee! Yet more I have to sayâof that anonâ For guests are here you thought not of, before, On whom your feast that waits for us dependsâ Marr'd, if disrelish'd,âmade, if they're content! END OF WOMAN'S WIT.</field>
