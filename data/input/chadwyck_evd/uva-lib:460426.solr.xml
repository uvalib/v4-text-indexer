      <field name="fulltext">ÃTIUS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Valentinian III. Emperor, in love with Fulvia. Fulvia, Daughter of Maximus, a Roman Patrician, in love with, and promised to Ãtius. Ãtius, General of CÃ¦sar's armies, in love with Fulvia. Honoria, Sister to Valentinian, secretly in love with Ãtius. Maximus, a Roman Patrician, Father of Fulvia, confidant, and secretly an enemy to Valentinian. Varus, PrÃ¦fect of the PrÃ¦torians, friend to Ãtius.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Part of the Roman forum, with an imperial throne on one side. View of Rome illuminated by night: triumphal arches, and other preparations for the celebration of the decennial feasts, and in honour of the return of Ãtius from his victory over Attila. Valentinian, Maximus, Varus, PrÃ¦tors and people. Max. No, sacred sir, the offspring of Quirinus Did never celebrate with greater pomp The last great day of our decennial rites. The blaze of torches and the people's shouts Disturb the shade and silence of the night, And Rome no longer envies former times Augustus' happy reign. Val. Well pleas'd I hear My faithful people's vows ascend the sky: I see the pomp and wait the victor's presence; All, all is cause of joyâbut chief the thought, That with this profferr'd hand I can bestow A gift more worthy of thy daughter's love, A throne enrich'd with laurels. Max. From her father Fulvia has learn'd, with true humility, Not to desire, nor to despise dominion: Let CÃ¦sar bid, my daughter shall obey. Val. In Fulvia more the lover would I find, And less the subject. Max. CÃ¦sar ne'er can fear She will not love those virtues which in him The world admireâBut thirst of vengeance only Inspires the restless soul of Maximus. [aside. Varus. Ãtius approachesâI behold already His foremost ensigns. Val. Let us hear the victor, And, Maximus, be thou partaker still In every good that Fortune heaps upon me. [he ascends the throne: Varus takes his place next him. Max. [aside.] Think not for this my injuries are forgot. SCENE II. Enter Ãtius in triumph, preceded by martial music; slaves and other ensigns of the vanquished, followed by soldiers and people. Ãt. Sir, we have conquer'dâto the inclement realms Of the bleak north, the terror of mankind Returns a fugitive. Yes, Ãtius, first Of Roman chiefs, can boast that he has seen Fear seize on Attila. The sun ne'er view'd A more extensive slaughter; scarce the field Suffic'd to bear the ghastly piles of slain: The blood in torrents flow'd; confus'd were heard Threats and laments, and midst the mingled tumults Of rage and dread, were blended undistinguish'd, The brave, the base, the victor and the vanquish'd. Not long suspended was the victory: Terror and desperation seiz'd the tyrant; He fled, and left (that nothing might retard His hasty flight) to us the full possession Of all his ill-got spoils. If you demand A proof of this, behold yon captive bands, Behold those conquer'd arms and streaming ensigns. Val. Ãtius, 'tis not o'er Attila alone Thou now hast triumph'd; in subduing him, Thou triumph'st o'er the hopes of Valentinian. Thou fixest on his brows the doubtful wreath; Thou, once again, to Tiber hast restor'd His martial honours. To thy fortitude And valiant arm all Italy must owe Her liberty and peace. Ãt. All Italy Owes not her peace to me. There are who hold it From their own worth alone. A race of heroes Meet in the bosom of the Adriatic, And change to seats of rest the unstable seas. With many a bridge they join the scatter'd isles, And with huge works repel the ocean's tide, While from afar the wondering traveller Sees mighty walls and marble domes arise, Where vessels once have sail'd. Val. Who has not heard Of fam'd Antenor's race? To us 'tis known, That when the flames of war were kindled first By Attila, they left their fields and towns, And in the bosom of the seas maintain'd Their threaten'd liberty: full well we know What wide extent their rising city forms; In future times what may we hope to view it, Since thus its infant state? Ãt. CÃ¦sar, I trace The seeds of mighty actions yet to come: The subject seas shall fear this people's nod; The rage of powerful kings they shall resist; Shall bear to distant realms their spreading sails, And Asia's purple tyrants strike with fear. Val. The happy omens Heaven succeed!âMeanwhile [descends from his throne. My guardian thou, my falling empire's safety, Within these arms receive a pledge of love. What gifts have I to recompense thy worth, Since all I have thy virtue has bestow'd, And still must guard them mine? But know, 'midst all My power, thou, Ãtius, art my noblest treasure. Do thou direct his towering flight, Still on the steep Tarpeian height, Returning shall my eagle light Victorious from the plain. Where'er the sun emits his ray, The regal bird shall steer his way; While with the God that rules the day I hold divided reign. [Exit with Varus and PrÃ¦tors. SCENE III. Ãtius, Maximus. Max. Ãtius, enough is given to fame and duty, Some moments give to friendship: let me press That conquering hand in mine. Ãt. Yes, friend, it joys me To see thee once again. I prize thy love Dear as this glorious pomp. But where is Fulvia? What does she? Where is she conceal'd? While each Hastes with impatience to behold my triumph, Thy daughter comes not. Max. See my daughter here. SCENE IV. Enter Fulvia. Ãt. My Fulvia, worthier of thyself, thy husband Again returns, and to thy beauty owes His greatest trophies. Midst alarms and death, Glory and love alike inflam'd my ardour; Nor would this hand have conquer'd for the pride Of laurel wreaths alone to crown my toilsâ But ha! what mean'st thou? At the tender names Of lover and of husband, from thy cheek The colour fadesâand dost thou meet me thus After our cruel parting? This my welcome! Fulv. O! torture to endure! [aside.]âI come, my lordâ Ãt. Does Fulvia treat me then with cold respect? Why am not I thy faithful husband still? Alas! thou'rt her no more whom once I knewâ Fulv. O Heaven! I'm still the sameâbut speak, my father. Ãt. What means she, Maximus? Max. I have till now Been silent, that our sorrows might not poison The joy this day should bring theeâyes, my friend, We live beneath a hard imperious yoke: Our very thoughts must be enslav'd: thy conquest Has freed us, Ãtius, from a foreign foe, But added strength to our domestic troubles. Fear was a curb on CÃ¦sar, that remov'd, Now thou hast conquer'd, soon the groaning land Shall find him haughtier still, and more the tyrant. Ãt. I cannot think him thusâat least from me His tyranny has ever been conceal'd: What would he seek? What would he claim? Max. Thy wife. Ãt. Ha! claim my wife! my Fulvia! Maximus? And have you both consented to betray me? Fulv. Alas! Max. What subterfuge could I employ? Or would'st thou have me, by refusing her To share his throne, expose her to the will Of an offended tyrant? Rather would'st thou I should revive the tale of old Virginius, And slay my daughter to preserve her chaste? O no! 'tis thou alone canst break our chains, And canst avenge thy wrongs. Thine are the people; The army all is thine. Thou ow'st revenge To Rome oppress'd, and to thy love betray'd. Thou know'st no victim can be slain which Heaven Accepts more gladly than an impious king. Ãt. What hast thou said?âBut passion blinds thy virtue, And grief is ever found a partial judge. Monarchs are delegates of Heaven on earth, And Heaven must punish themâBe every means Employ'd, but let us guard our faith untainted. Max. Exalted hero! equal to thy courage, [embraces him.] With wonder Maximus surveys thy truth, That rises still superior to thy wrongs.â âYes we must change our speech, dissimulation Assist me now. [aside. Fulv. Can Ãtius then so tamely Resign his Fulvia to another's arms? Ãt. Thou yet art free from every tye. To CÃ¦sar I'll plead my cause, and all shall yet be well. Fulv. O Heaven! and should'st thou speak, I tremble for thee! Ãt. As yet the emperor knows not of my love. Max. From him, with caution, I conceal'd your passion. Ãt. Hence springs the error. CÃ¦sar's not to blame: No, had he heard, his prudence had suppress'd His growing love; he knows how much he owes me, And knows it were not wisdom to provoke me. Fulv. Trust not too farâÃtius, a thousand fears Distract my soul: CÃ¦sar's too much a lover, And thou art too unguarded in thy warmth. O Heaven! reflect awhileâmy heart forebodes Some fatal mischief: I was born unhappy, And must not hope my fate will ever change. Ãt. With conquest I'm return'd; thou know'st that Ãtius Adores thee ever, yet my Fulvia weeps. Still in thy dear, thy faithful breast Thy thoughts to me confine: Lull each intruding fear to rest, And all thy cares be mine. Thou by thy sorrows seem'st to mourn, That Ãtius leaves thee thus forlorn, Forgetful of his love: Think not so base a mind I bear, Nor think to me that CÃ¦sar e'er Will so ungrateful prove. [Exit. SCENE V. Maximus, Fulvia. Fulv. 'Tis time, my father, that respect at length Should give me leave to speak. You promis'd first My hand to Ãtius' vows, then gave me charge To hear and to encourage CÃ¦sar's passion, Assuring me I never should be his. I your commands obey'd, believ'd your promise; Yet, when I hope to take the hand of Ãtius, I hear you tell me that my hopes are vain. Max. I ne'er, my daughter, purpos'd to deceive thee. Then mark me; 'tis not sure the worst of fortune To share Augustus' bed. Fulv. And can you suffer, That he, who dar'd insult your consort's virtue, Should wed your daughter? Can you thus forget The affront you once receiv'd? Is Maximus So dazzled with the splendor of a throne? Max. Come to my breast, thy father's dearest part! This just resentment merits I should tell thee What else I would conceal. Know then, with art I seem forgetful of my wounded honour. Hatred too soon discover'd loses oft The means of vengeance: now the time's at hand, And we must seize it. Wedded to the tyrant, Thou may'st with ease destroy him, or prepare The way for me to pierce his impious breast. Fulv. What do I hear! And can I then, my father, Present this hand to CÃ¦sar to betray him? O! in my looks he'd read my foul design: Fear is companion still to crimes like these: The soul, for ever brooding o'er her guilt, Shrinks from herself: the criminal sometimes Is fortunate, but never is secure: The people will revenge their sovereign's death. Max. That fear is vain; since all alike detest him. Fulv. No, you're deceiv'dâthe giddy crowd adore The tyrant dead, whom living they abhorr'd. Max. You, Fulvia, first reviv'd my sleeping hatred, Then shew that coldness you condemn'd in me. Fulv. Forgive me, sir, if I with freedom speak: When I of late condemn'd your tardy vengeance, I counsell'd not deceit. Max. I thought thee wiser, And less subjected to the servile ties Of virtue and of conscience; only useful To abject souls, but by the noble scorn'd. Fulv. Are these the virtuous seeds which, till this hour, You planted in me from my earliest age? Either you then deceiv'd, or now deceive me. Max. Each different age requires its different maxims: Those suit with childhood, these with riper years: I then deceiv'd thee. Fulv. You deceive me now; For with ourselves is born the hate of guilt, And love of virtue: from its infant state The soul an impulse feels of good and evil. Oft have you told me this; I now confess it, And all confirms it. You, even you, my father, While thus you seek to steel my heart to treason, Must own compunction. If you hold me dear, Think of your glory; think that now you goâ Max. No more, rash girl! I have endur'd enough. Counsel not me, or if thou needs must counsel, Go, counsel with thy equals; but remember That I am still a parent, thou a child. Fulv. O! bid me not recall to mind, That from your source my life I drew; For in your words no more I find The father now whom once I knew. From me awhile vouchsafe to learn The reverence due to sovereign sway; In me a daughter's love discern, And, ah! your own remorse obey. [Exit. SCENE VI. Maximus alone. How adverse is my fate! Though all the earth Abounds with villainy, when Maximus Would seek a villain, each assumes the hero, And baffles his designs. Affronted love Has prov'd too weak to fire the rage of Ãtius: My daughter disobeys meâbe it soâ I must no longer dally with my purpose, But hasten on the blowâtoo much already Have I disclos'd, and ere the dawn appears CÃ¦sar shall die: Emilius for the deed Will lend his faithful arm. What then may follow? Or Valentinian falls, and crowns my vengeance; Or, grant he should survive, 'tis mine to cast The guilt on Ãtius: 'tis an easy task: CÃ¦sar, the rival of his fame and love, Without my arts will deem him criminal. Or should aught else betide, I from th' event Can form resolves anew: in greatest dangers That wisdom oft is best which trusts to chance. The sailor, fearing rocks and wind, Who runs in thought each peril o'er, Must live in humble state confin'd, A simple fisher on the shore. 'Tis oft with prudence we confide To Fortune's hand our weal or woe; Her hand has oft that aid supplied Which wisdom never could bestow. [Exit. SCENE VII. A royal apartment with pictures. Honoria, Varus. Hon. I ask thee of the victor not his conquests: Of these I've heard enoughâHow does he bear The crowd's applauses? Do his looks preserve The sternness of the warrior? Has his triumph Given him new pride, or soften'd him to gentleness? This, Varus, tell me, not his deeds of arms. Varus. Honoria, pardon me, if I believ'd That CÃ¦sar's sister rather wish'd to hear The deeds of Ãtius, than to ask of aught Pertaining to himself. These strict enquiries Resemble more the lover than the sovereign. Hon. Hard is the slavery of our wretched sex! Scarce can our lips but twice repeat a name, And we are titled lovers. While so many Dwell on his valour and exalt his praise; While wondering throngs hail Ãtius' glad return, Honoria still alone remains behind; Clos'd in these walls she seeks not to behold him Yet this reserve escapes not censuring tongues. Varus. Too much reserve is oft a sign of love. Hon. Yes, Varus, to thy long-tried faith and service Such freedom is indulg'd. But sure the distance 'Twixt Ãtius and Honoria, from thy mind Should banish such suspicion. Varus. All admire The fortitude of Ãtius: Rome adores him; The universe is fill'd with his renown: His foes with reverence name him: 'twere injustice Here to refuse that love his worth demands. Hon. Since you appear so far the friend of Ãtius, You should not thus extol his rising power: Augustus, in his nature, is too prone To admit suspicion: while you to my brother Exalt your friend, you serve his cause but ill. The time may comeâyou understand me, Varus. Varus. I that am Ãtius' friend, with greater caution Will speak his praise: but, princess, if you love him Be less ingenious to torment yourself. If gentle love thy soul inspire, Why should'st thou blush to own the fire? Why scorn the shaft that rives thy breast? Ãtius, whose deeds so glorious shine, Has rais'd his state to equal thine, By Fortune's hand in vain depress'd. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Honoria alone. Detested grandeur! tyrant of the mind! Why wilt thou thus distract us? Why forbid To indulge the freedom of unequal passion, Yet prove too weak to guard our yielding heart? Harmless nymphs on rural plains, Happy is the lot you prove, Whom in love no law restrains, Save the gentle laws of love. How blest! could I my suffering tell To him whose virtues cause my smart, And unconstrain'd, like you, reveal The flame that preys upon my heart. [Exit. SCENE IX. Valentinian, Maximus. Val. Let Ãtius know that I expect him here. [to an attendant. Yes, friend, his glory now begins to cast A shade o'er Valentinian: every one Dwells in my presence on th' exploits of Ãtius: Rome stiles him her deliverer: he himself Knows his own power too well: I must, to ensure His faith, exalt him to Honoria's bed; So shall the marriage-bond be his reward, And my security. Max. Indeed the people Have idoliz'd him to excess: they seem As if unmindful of their sovereign's name, And may if he commandâbut I have doneâ Ãtius I think is true, and doubts are vain; But were he not, methinks to exalt him thus Would ill secure his faith. Val. A gift so mighty Must quench ambition in the soul. Max. Will rather Excite it: when the conflagration rises, The stream but adds new fuel to the flame. Val. How shall I better hope to bind him to me? Wouldst thou I should pursue a tyrant's steps, And grow the mark of universal hatred? Max. The earliest art of reigning is to bear The hatred of mankind: a monarch still Must exercise dominion o'er offenders; And hatred more secures the throne than love. Val. No, Maximus, the man who makes himself Too much the object of another's fear, Thence adds to his own terrors: all extremes Together meet; and on some future day, The headstrong vulgar, from excess of fear, May gather boldness. Max. You, my lord, best know The arts of reigning; monarchs have a light Unknown to subjects: zeal for your repose Urg'd me thus far. I meant but to remind you That it becomes us with preventive care, While danger threatens, to provide for safety. When gently murmuring as it goes, The hollow riv'let scarcely flows, A pebble can its lapse oppose, A slender branch the course restrain. But when, with falling waters swell'd, In narrow banks no longer held, The billows rise above the shore, And bear along, with deepening roar, The crumbling fences to the main. [Exit. SCENE X. Valentinian alone. To those that distant view the throne, it seems Heaven's choicest gift; to those who view it near, It seems the worst. SCENE XI. Enter Ãtius. Ãt. I come to attend your will. Val. Ãtius, I cannot bear, though for a moment, To seem ungrateful to thee: Tiber sav'd From foreign arms, my peace, my dignity, All, all I've gain'd are but the happy fruits Of Ãtius' wisdom and his conquering sword. Should Valentinian yield to thee his throne, He gives not, but to thee restores thy own. Thus, midst my wealth, when I would recompense The virtues of a friend who conquers for me, I find, in spite of empire, still I'm poor. Ãt. When through the fight I toil'd for Rome and thee, The deed itself became my great reward. What would I more? Augustus' love will ever Suffice for me. Val. But not for Valentinian. The world shall learn that, while I vainly strove To recompense thy worth, my gratitude Left nought untried. Ãtius, the blood of CÃ¦sar Shall be to thine united; ne'er on thee Can I bestow a stronger pledge of love: To-morrow's sun shall see thee wed Honoria. Ãt. [aside.] What do I hear! Val. Thou dost not answerâspeak. Ãt. So vast an honour doubtless must surprise me. Honoria's rank demands a king and throne, I have no crowns to boast, and Ãtius, sir, Is nothing but a subject. Val. Such a subject As Ãtius, far excels the proudest king. If kingdoms are not thine, thy valorous arm Can kingdoms give to others. To possess, Is Fortune's gift alone; but to bestow them, Is Virtue's task. Ãt. Thy sister owes the world, Great sir, a race of kings; to me united, Will bring forth subjects only: well thou know'st By these unequal nuptials that Honoria To Ãtius may descend, but Ãtius never Can rise to her. Val. My sister and the world Sustain no loss by such a glorious union: Or should they lose, yet, while I recompense A hero's worth, my sister and the world Can ne'er complain. Ãt. I must not, sir, consent That CÃ¦sar, to be grateful thus to one, Should prove unjust to many. Val. Let us speak This once without concealment. Thy respect Is but a veil to cover thy refusal. What would'st thou more? Is then my gift so little? Must CÃ¦sar ever stand indebted to thee? Remember, he who spurns at all reward Is not less proud than he who asks too much. Ãt. Well then, your frankness shall encourage mine: What you have offerr'd, sir, for my reward Would prove my punishment. Val. I did not think Thy sovereign's sister, join'd to thee in marriage, Would make thee wretched. Ãt. Even this profferr'd gift Is little to the man who loves another. Val. Where is the beauty who so far exceeds Honoria's merits? Is she born my subject? Are my dominions honour'd with her presence? It shall be mine to knit these glorious ties: Declare to me her name. Ãt. Her name is Fulvia. Val. Fulvia? Ãt. The sameâHe seems disturb'd. [aside. Val. [aside.] O Heaven! And knows she of thy love? Ãt. I think she does not: [aside.] Let me not raise his anger against her. Val. First gain the maid's consentâSee if her choice Opposes not thy suit. Ãt. That care be mine: Meantime thy sanction, CÃ¦sar, shall suffice. Val. Some other lover may perchance have gain'd On her affection. Ãt. Never.âWhere's the man Whose rashness seeks to ravish such a prize From him whose hand has sav'd imperial Rome? I know him not. Val. But should there yet be one? Ãt. He then should see that Ãtius could no less Assert his rights than guard his sovereign's empire: Yes, he should findâ Val. And what if I were he? Ãt. That gift which costs a pang from CÃ¦sar's heart Would prove more glorious to me. Val. But a subject Must not require, to recompense his service, So vast a sacrifice from him who reigns. Ãt. CÃ¦sar is sovereign, Ãtius asks from him This sacrifice; Ãtius, who, till this hour, Has serv'd unrecompens'd: CÃ¦sar, who knows What gratitude exacts; who owes to me His peace, his dignity; who has confess'd That should he render up the throne to Ãtius, He gives not, but to him restores his own; And that each moment but augments his fear To seem ungrateful to him. Val. What presumption! [aside. I thought that when I call'd to mind thy merits, And own'd each service, I in part repaid them. Ãt. I call them to thy mind, when for rewardâ Val. No moreâenoughâI understand thee, Ãtius. Yes, CÃ¦sar knows thy bosom's fires, He sees to what thy claim aspires, 'Tis his to fix thy doom. But thou more wisely now control Th' effusions of a fearless soul, That well may suit the stern alarms Of distant camps and clashing arms, But suit not here at Rome. [Exit. Ãt. Now let us see if he'll oppose my love. SCENE XII. Enter Fulvia. Fulv. Ãtius, I read thy anger in thy looks: Hast thou to CÃ¦sar then discours'd of me? Ãt. I have; but kept from him thy love a secret: Hence thou hast little cause to fear. Fulv. What said he To thy request? What answer gave Augustus? Ãt. He neither yielded nor oppos'd my suit; By certain signs I found he grew disturb'd, But yet he durst not give his anger vent. Fulv. You raise my apprehension. He who feels Resentment, yet assumes an outward calm, Must surely plan some cautious scheme of vengeance. Ãt. You fear too soon. SCENE XIII. Enter Honoria. Hon. Ãtius, I owe you more Than words can pay: my brother would debase Honoria's hand by joining it to yours; But you, more just, have now convinc'd Augustus That Ãtius is unworthy such alliance. Ãt. Honoria, no: 'tis not for this you owe Your thanks to me; 'tis for a nobler service. You know this arm, that guards Honoria's throne, Gives her the power to treat me thus with scorn. Hon. Indeed I stand indebted much to Ãtius, And 'tis with pain I find the stars compel me, Spite of myself, to be the messenger Of fatal tidings to his hapless love. [to Fulv.] Fulvia, soon as the morning rises, CÃ¦sar Will take thee for his bride. Fulv. What says Honoria? Ãt. What do I hear! Hon. He gave me now in charge To speak his purpose. Ãtius, yet have comfort, And learn to exult that she, whom most you love, Reigns o'er a subject world. Ãt. This is too muchâ CÃ¦sar would tempt too far the faith of Ãtius. What right has he to rule o'er my affections? To ravish Fulvia from me? To contemn me? Perhaps he thinks I tamely will endure it; Or does he wish that Rome, through him, should prove A fatal scene of blood? Hon. Does Ãtius threaten? Is this his truth, his boasted loyalty? Ãt. If still my sovereign would engage My breast to act a subject's part, Let him not then too far enrage The passions that divide my heart. But when with wrongs my bosom bleeds, Untimely let him ne'er complain, If anger then the bound exceeds, And gives to frantic rage the rein. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Honoria, Fulvia. Fulv. Honoria, keep his transports hid from CÃ¦sar: Ãtius is faithful still; he speaks but thus Through disappointed love. Hon. Fulvia, methinks Thou shew'st too much of fear and pity for him; And does not pity sometimes spring from love? Fulv. Princess, you wrong me much, for well I know To whom this bosom owes its first affections. Hon. Be not too warmâ'twas but a slight suspicion. Fulv. If credit must be given to such suspicion, Honoria too might furnish cause for doubt: By thy resentment I perceive how well Thou bear'st to be rejected. I should think Thou wert a lover, yet I'll not believe it. Hon. And when thou dar'st insult me with suspicions Injurious to my honour, I might well Rebuke thy arrogance, yet I forbear. Though plac'd not yet on CÃ¦sar's throne, Already in thy looks are shown The pride of sovereign state. 'Tis harder far with equal mind To bear the good by Heaven assign'd, Than all the frowns of Fate. [Exit. SCENE XV. Fulvia alone. Too cruel Fortune! persecute me still, And raise new troubles to disturb my peace: Incense Honoria, kindle jealousy In CÃ¦sar's breast, and render Ãtius wretched; Deprive me of a father's fostering care, But never shalt thou rob me of my love: For spite of thee, thy rigour shall exalt The glorious triumph of my constant heart. While zephyr breathes a gentle breeze, And calms to peace the ruffled seas, Each vessel flies with prosperous gales, Each happy pilot careless sails. The proof of courage is to abide The roaring billows' adverse force; To stem the rough tempestuous tide, Nor wander from the destin'd course. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Palatine gardens in view of the imperial palace; flowers and fountains, water-falls, grottoes and statues. Maximus alone. What awful silence! All the palace now Is wrapt in peace. See where the new-born day Reddens in yonder east, and yet around No voice is heard, no person seen: ere this Ãmilius must have given the wish'd-for blowâ He promis'd on the tyrant to revenge The wrongs of Maximusâmy friend is tardy. SCENE II. Enter Fulvia. Fulv. Alas, my father! Max. SpeakâWhat says my daughter? Fulv. What hast thou done? Max. Done, Fulvia! Fulv. O ye powers! CÃ¦sar has been attack'dâfull well I know By whom the deed was plann'dâ'Tis thou, my father, That, to revenge thee, urg'd the assassin's hand. Max. But say, is CÃ¦sar dead? Fulv. Think of thy safety: Already is the apartment round beset With arms and soldiers. Max. Tell me if he lives, Or lies a senseless corse. Fulv. Alas! I know not; Lost in my fears I could attend to nothing. Max. Vain, childish terrors! I myself will go To learn th' event. [going, he meets Val. SCENE III. Enter Valentinian without his mantle and laurel; his sword drawn, attended by the PrÃ¦torian guard. Val. [entering.] Let every pass be guarded; Stop every outlet. Max. [aside.] Still the tyrant lives! Malicious Fortune! Val. Fulvia! Maximus! What heart could e'er conceive it! Max. Speak, my lord, What has befallen? Val. Such unexampled treason Was never heard. Fulv. [aside.] O most unhappy father! Max. [aside.] He knows it all. Val. In whom shall I confide? My best, my dearest friends attempt my life. Max. Be firm my heart. [aside.] And is it possible Can such a wretch be found? Val. Yes, Maximus, Such has been found, nor is to thee unknown. Max. [disturbed.] To me! my lord. Val. Yes, thee; but Heaven defends The lives of monarchs. Vainly hop'd Ãmilius To bury in my breast his fatal steel: He thought to find me buried deep in sleep; He was deceiv'd. I heard him softly enter My clos'd apartment; by his silent tread, As he drew nearer to my couch, my mind Presag'd some treason; strait I rose, and snatch'd The nearest sword: alarm'd, the villain fled; But as he fled I dealt amidst the shade My strokes at random: with the noise the guard Rush'd in, and by the sudden entering light, I saw my weapon stain'd with fresh-drawn blood, But sought in vain the traitor who escap'd me. Max. Perhaps 'twas not Ãmilius. Val. Yes, I heard His well-known voice; for when I gave the wound A sudden cry broke from him. Max. What could make The slave of CÃ¦sar hazard such a deed? Val. Though his the deed, another plann'd the treason. Fulv. [aside.] O Heaven! Max. Permit me, sacred sir, to trace The villain's steps. Val. That care belongs to Varus: Thou, Maximus, depart not. Max. I am lost! [aside. Perhaps I better may than he.â Val. My friend, Leave me not thus, for O! should'st thou forsake me, Where shall I hope for counsel or assistance? Max. I shall obeyâI breathe again. [aside. Fulv. [aside.] Once more My life returns. Max. Whom can you further, sir, Suspect of treason? Val. Hast thou then a doubt? Dost thou not see in this the hand of Ãtius? O! could I once produce the proofs against him, His life should pay the forfeit of his crime. Fulv. [aside.] What new misfortune falls on wretched Fulvia? Max. I cannot think that Ãtius is a traitor; At least he has no cause: receiv'd with honour, Applauded by his sovereign; could his heart Consent to this?â'Tis true, that jealousy, Ambition, love and popular applause Too oft contaminate the firmest loyalty. Ãtius beholds himself belov'd of all, Elate with conquest, master of the troops, He may perhaps forget his vow'd allegiance. Fulv. Can you, my father, who have known his virtues, Speak of him thus? Max. 'Tis true, I am Ãtius' friend, But CÃ¦sar's subject. Val. And does Fulvia then Defend a traitor?âO! my jealous heart Too truly has suspected. Max. Can you think Fulvia will harbour any love but yours? You are deceiv'd; she pleads in his behalf For pity, not for love: the threatening view Of punishment and death excites her mind To feel compassionâAre you yet to learn The native weakness of the tender sex? SCENE IV. Enter Varus. Varus. CÃ¦sar, in vain I've sought to find the traitor. Val. Where can he lie conceal'd? Varus. Not all our care Discovers his retreat. Val. And must I still Remain uncertain thus? Whom shall I trust? Whom shall I fear? When was there ever known A state more curs'd than mine? Max. Compose your thoughts: The assassin's failing in the stroke design'd, Must baffle all the secret traitor's schemes. I'll seek Ãmilius, and with zealous care Watch o'er your safety. Let us still remember, The ruffian that assail'd your life is known, And him meanwhile we may at least secure. Val. Assist me, friend, I place my hopes in thee. In thee a spouse and prince confide, While fears and doubts my soul divide, To thee I trust my life and love. Then, friend, thy faithful aid prepare, And thou, dear object of my care, For ever constant prove. [Exit. SCENE V. Maximus, Fulvia. Fulv. And can you, father, lay the guilt on Ãtius? What urges you? Max. Unthinking girl! his ruin Is my security: this smooths the path To my revenge; for should he fall, Augustus Is left without defence. Thou see'st by this How much his death imports; but Maximus Has views too mighty for thy sex's weakness: Leave these to him whose years are more than thine, Whose wisdom greater. Fulv. O! let years and wisdom Yet teach you justice. Max. Am I then unjust In seeking to revenge my injur'd honour? Or, grant I wereâthe fatal path is taken, And 'tis too late to think of a retreat. Fulv. O! never, never 'tis too late, my father, To tread again the abandon'd steps of virtue; For he who feels abhorrence of his crime, Redeems his innocence. Max. And shall I never Persuade thee to be silent? Tell me, daughter, What dost thou seek? Would'st thou instruct thy father In what thy youth was taught by him? Or would'st thou Make him subservient to thy feeble love? Fulvia, restrain the license of thy speech, And learn in future not to incense a father. Fulv. Must I be silent? Must I fear to speak When I behold my sovereign's life invaded; Know you are criminal, while Ãtius bears The imputed guilt? What bosom can support it? Release me, sir, from every tie of duty, Or ask some other proof of my obedience. Max. Perfidious girl! I see thy purpos'd victim. Yes, thou would'st sacrifice me to thy passion: Go thenâwith impious rage abuse that fondness Which could not keep a thought conceal'd from thee, And for a lover's sake accuse a parent. Go, speak whate'er thy rage design'd, But yet, ingrate, recall to mind Whose guilt your lips unfold. Go then, a father's deeds betray, But yet reflect that fatal day You take a father's life away, Your life from him you hold. [Exit. SCENE VI. Fulvia alone. What shall I do? Alas! 'tis equal guilt To speak or to concealâTo speakâO Heaven! Were parricideâI tremble but to think it; And if I still am silent, Ãtius dies! At that idea round my heart congeals The curdling bloodâWhat counsel now remains For Fulvia? SCENE VII. Enter Ãtius. Ãtius! ha! what brings thee here? Say, whither goest thou? Ãt. To defend Augustus. I heard but nowâ Fulv. O! flyâfor know, on thee Suspicion of the treason falls. Ãt. On me! Thou art deceiv'dâTiber too oft has seen My faith approv'd: the man who by his deeds Can conquer others, still will rise superior To every feeble blast of foul detraction. Fulv. But what if CÃ¦sar has himself accus'd thee? Say that I heard him? Ãt. If Augustus said it, He never could believe it: had he paus'd But for a moment, every thing he saw Would plead in my defence; all Italy, The attesting world; his glory and his empire, Preserv'd by me, must make him own the falsehood. Fulv. I know thy ruin would be well aveng'd; But who can tell me that thy friends would give Their timely aid? Alas! the deepest vengeance Would not console me for thy lossâO! fly, Fly if thou lov'st me, and indulge my fears. Ãt. Thy fond affection raises fancied dangers. Fulv. In what dost thou confide? Thy valour, Ãtius? Heroes are mortal, and oppress'd by numbers. Or in thy virtue? Ah! from that alone My soul forebodes misfortuneâYes, thy virtue Is now thy worst of foes. Ãt. My confidence Is founded, Fulvia, on an upright heart, A stranger to remorse; on innocence, That brings its own applause; in this right hand, So needful to the weal of Rome. Augustus Is no barbarian, nor insensible To deeds of worth: should one like me be lost, A tyrant would himself confess such loss Not lightly were supplied. SCENE VII. Enter Varus with a guard. Fulv. Varus, what news? Ãt. Is CÃ¦sar's life in safety? Can my aid Avail for his defence? What does he? Varus. CÃ¦sar Has sent me to you. Ãt. Let us hasten to him. Varus. Not soâhe sends me to demand your sword. Ãt. Say'st thou? Fulv. This I foresawâ Ãt. What means Augustus? Can it be possible? Varus. Would it were not! I pity you, my friend, and grieve that fate Compels me, while my secret heart rebels, To act a part injurious to our friendship. Ãt. There Varusâ[gives his sword.] pity CÃ¦sar, not thy friend. Bear him this sword that oft was seen To guard his throne and fame: Remind him what I once have been, And dye his cheek with shame. Thou, if thou prizest Ãtius' love, [to Fulvia. The tender tear restrain; Since all the sufferings I can prove, Must spring from Fulvia's pain. [Exit guarded. SCENE VIII. Fulvia, Varus. Fulv. If ever thou didst feel a soft affection, Have pity, Varus, on our mutual passion, And plead the cause of an unhappy friend. Varus. Your love discover'd adds to my affliction; And fain I would assist your cause; but Ãtius Is his own foe, Heaven knows! and by his speech Incenses CÃ¦sar. Fulv. Well his high demeanour Is known to all; nor should it now, methinks, Be deem'd in him a crime; and surely Varus At least must own, while Ãtius' tongue proclaims His own deserts, truth gives his words a sanction. Varus. Sometimes 'tis virtue to conceal the truth. And if I praise not now his ostentation, 'Tis friendship makes me silent: for his sake I'll prove my utmost power; and grant it Heaven The attempt may not be vain. Fulv. O! say not thus, For to the wretched he denies assistance, Who, while he gives it, doubts th' event. Varus. His safety Your will determines: give your hand to CÃ¦sar, And every power is yours. Fulv. O! never, never, Will I be other than the spouse of Ãtius. Varus. But to preserve him from his fortune, Fulvia Must yield a little: she alone can soften The wrath of Valentinian; then delay not, And if thy bosom feel not love for CÃ¦sar, Yet learn to feign it. Fulv. I'll pursue thy counsel; With what success, Heaven knows.âDissimulation Is ever criminal; and O! I find My heart abhors the trial. Varus. To dissemble In such a cause is virtue; and a woman Can ne'er repine to act what suits her sex. Fulv. With ease what numbers love can feign That never warm'd the heart: But generous minds must still disdain The wretched mask of art! My lips, alas! but ill forbear To speak my thoughts distress'd; Yet speech and silence both declare The emotions of my breast. [Exit. SCENE IX. Varus alone. Unstable Fortune! Thoughtless is the man Who trusts thy fickle smiles! Too happy Ãtius; But now was envied by the youth of Rome, The mark of emulation. In a moment The scene is chang'd and he becomes the object Of general pity;âyes, unstable Fortune, Thoughtless is he who trusts thy fickle smiles! A shepherd, bred in humble shade, With weeds of poverty array'd, Sometimes by Fortune's favouring aid, O'er subject realms extends his reign. In regal purple, near the throne, Another born; by Fortune's frown Is driven from kingdoms once his own, To feed his flocks upon the plain. [Exit. SCENE X. A gallery of statues with seats; a large seat for two persons. A balcony open, a view of Rome. Honoria, Maximus. Hon. Yes, Maximus, I must confess it, all Accuses Ãtius: he is CÃ¦sar's rival, And thinks that to his worth and name alone The universe must bend. What then avails To plead in his defence? I heard myself His threats, and now behold th' effect has follow'dâ And yet my heart, incredulous, can never Believe his guiltâthat Ãtius is a traitor. Max. O unexampled virtue! this, indeed, Is clemency's excess! And who, Honoria, Has greater cause than you have to condemn him? He has despis'd you, and refus'd that hand Which kings contend for.âWho but youâ Hon. Alas! Tell me no more the wrongs I have sustain'd; I feel them deeply hereâIngrate and proud! To think of them distracts me, Maximus: Not that I love him, or regret the loss Of Ãtius' handâoffended dignity, My fameâmy honourâthese and these aloneâ Max. I know it well; but all, Honoria, know not Your bosom's secret springs: I need not tell you, We easier far believe the deeds that flow From weakness than from virtue: clemency In you may seem but love. One way remains, And only one, to banish such suspicion. Let vengeance fill your thoughts: a just revenge You never should abhor, while clemency To such excess but urges new offences. Hon. My private wrongs are not my greatest care: Think of my brother's danger; let us hear What Ãtius says, and seek to find the traitor. Perhaps he yet is innocentâ Max. 'Tis trueâ Who knows?âeven yet he may repent, Honoria, And yet accept your hand. Hon. Accept my hand! Shall I so far forget myself!âO no, Were this proud man the world's unbounded lord, He never should obtain me, Maximus. Max. And yet how easy we deceive ourselves: He boasts your will is his, that you adore him, That he at pleasure rules Honoria's heart, And that a glance from him will calm your anger. Hon. Presumptuous insolence! he soon shall find His folly crush'd. The first who woos my love, (Above a subject's rank) shall be my lord, He'll see that then I want not crowns or empires, And if he rule, at will, Honoria's heart. [going. SCENE XI. Enter Valentinian. Val. Honoria stay. Thou must, for my repose, Bestow thy hand on one I fear to thee But little grateful; true he has done us wrong, Yet must we make the public weal secure. He asks thy nuptial faith, and prudence bids Accept the peaceful offer. Hon. Ãtius sure Repents the past. [aside.] Know I this suitor's name? Val. Too well thou know'st it; and I fear, my sister, To speak, what spoken will but urge thy lips To frame reproaches. Thou wilt say his soul Is haughty, cruel, that he little knows The ties of faith, that all the affronts we have suffer'd Are yet too recent. I confess it allâ But when I weigh the occasion, with regret My counsel bids thee not reject the alliance. Hon. Shall I refuse him then? [aside.] If my consent Secure your peace, this heart is yours to give. Max. What means Augustus? Ãtius seeks his life, And would he thus reward him? Val. 'Tis not Ãtius Employs my thoughtsâI speak of Attila. Hon. O fatal error! [aside.] Attila? Max. And whence Such unexpected turn? Val. This very moment A messenger, by letters to my hand, Has signified his wish: hence may we see His pride is lower'd: this offer brings no shame To thee, my sister; thou receiv'st a husband Whom kings obey;âBarbarian though he be, His manners soften'd by thy noble love, May take the shape of virtues. Hon. Say, does Ãtius Know Attila's request? Val. Does Ãtius know it? Must I consult with Ãtius? To what end Appeal to him? Hon. To mortify his pride; To let him find his aid less needful here; To let him see Honoria's hand alone Can save the Roman state. Val. This shall he know: Mean time may I to Attila return Your full consent? Hon. Noâlet me first behold Your life in safety.âFind the hidden traitor: Let Ãtius speak, and then, without disguise, Honoria will reveal her soul's dear purpose. While thus for thee with fears oppress'd I feel my trembling heart; Ah! think, can e'er Honoria's breast Receive love's gentle dart? Can the soft flame of amorous bliss With me its influence prove, If, when my breast is lost to peace, I then begin to love? [Exit. SCENE XII. Valentinian, Maximus. Val. Conduct the prisoner hitherâ[to an attendant.] Midst my doubts, From thee I seek for counsel. May I hope This tie with Attila will tend in part To my security? Max. It rather tends To expose to greater dangers: he but seeks To lull your vigilance, this well-feign'd friendship Will draw him nearer to you; he, with Ãtius May plan some fatal scheme. This late attempt Makes all too clear; and well thou know'st that Ãtius Left every passage free for Attila, When Attila escap'd; yet duty bade him Conduct to thee his prisoner: this he fail'd, And yet the power was his. Val. 'Tis all too true. SCENE XIII. Enter Fulvia. Fulv. Augustus, ease my terror. Is the traitor Discover'd yet? Say, is your life in safety? Val. Can then my safety be so dear to Fulvia? Fulv. And can you doubt it? I behold in CÃ¦sar A lover to whose fate my own must soon Be join'd (O death to feign) [aside.] in Hymen's bands. Max. What do I hear? Does not her secret heart Belie her lips' profession? [aside. Val. If my danger Awaken gentle pity in thy breast, I prize my safety less. May I then hope Thy faith unshaken? Fulv. Whilst I live, shall CÃ¦sar Still share my tenderest thoughts. O pardon, Ãtius! [aside. Max. I'm lost in wonder. [aside. Val. Did not Ãtius' treason Claim all our thoughts, thy hand had long ere this Been join'd to mine; but dear his life shall answer This outrage to my love. Fulv. A crime like his Demands your just revenge: but who, meanwhile, Shall guard you from the people's headlong rage? They dote on Ãtius: O! take heed, Augustus, I shudder at the thought. Val. 'Tis that retards My vengeance. Max. Now I understand thee, Fulvia. [aside. Fulv. Say, he were innocent, in him you lose Your great support: behold your life expos'd To treason's secret aims: behold your name Hated of allâI tremble but to think it. Val. Grant Heaven he were not guilty! but he comes, And comes by my command. Fulv. What do I hear! [aside. Val. Now, Fulvia, from himself impartial learn, What Ãtius is. Fulv. Permit me to depart. [going. The criminal, who meets his judge alone, More freely will confess. Val. No, Fulvia, stay. Max. Ãtius approaches. Fulv. Heavens! Val. Now, Fulvia, take Thy seat by CÃ¦sar's side. Fulv. By CÃ¦sar's side! And shall a subject then presumeâ Val. Remember The maid who holds a monarch in her chains, No longer is a subject. Fulv. Yet, permit meâ Val. No moreâbe seatedâfrom this hour begin To make the throne familiar. Fulv. I obey. [sits on the right hand of Val. O cruel trial! SCENE XIV. Enter Ãtius. Ãt. Heavens! what do I see! [entering he sees Fulvia, and stops. In Fulvia such inconstancy! Fulv. Be firm My breaking heart! [aside. Val. Leader, approach. Ãt. Who now Is judge of Ãtius? Does my fate depend On CÃ¦sar or on Fulvia? Val. I and Fulvia, Are but one judge: for since by nuptial ties I call her mine, she reigns a sovereign here. Ãt. O faithless woman! [aside. Fulv. Could I but assure him That Fulvia now dissembles! [aside. Val. Ãtius, hear, And learn awhile to curb the native pride That can no more avail thee. Secret treason Is aim'd at me, and each in thee believes The treason's author: all bespeaks thy guilt: Thy proud refusal of Honoria's hand; Thy insolence in conquest; thy permission Of Attila's escape; thy jealousy; Thy rash presumptuous love; thy open threats, Of which thou know'st myself so late was witness. Think how to clear thy fame, or merit pardon. Max. Now, fate, betray me not. [aside. Ãt. CÃ¦sar, 'tis true The charge is specious. Where's the assassin hid, Whose hand assail'd thee? Who accuses Ãtius As author of the treason? CÃ¦sar, thou, Thou art the accuser of the guilt of Ãtius, At once the judge and witness. Fulv. Heavens! he's lost. Val. And shall I bear such insolence? Ãt. Howe'er The crime is true, why is it charg'd on me? Because I have refus'd to wed Honoria? And have I thus with toil preserv'd for CÃ¦sar His liberty, that he should now forbid me To own my heart's affection? Am I guilty From Attila's late flight? And should I then Have made him prisoner, that all Europe freed From fear of him, who bound their arms to ours. Might join their force against imperial Rome? Seek out some other warrior. I am guilty Because I know myself, and freely speak, What conscious worth approves.âThe ignoble mind Shrinks from itself, nor dares review its deeds. Fulv. O might I yet retire! [aside. Val. This rash defence Adds to thy former guiltâHast thou ought else To plead in thy behalf? Ãt. Let this suffice: For what remains, let CÃ¦sar ask no more. Val. What canst thou further say? Ãt. That he whose arm Defends the ungrateful, fosters tyranny; That valour in the subject still excites Envy in him who reigns; that CÃ¦sar scorns To owe his all to Ãtius; that he fears In me that treason, which he knows too well The deed, that robs me of my love, deserves. Val. Dost thou insult me thus! presumptuous man! Fulv. O! Heavens! [aside. Val. I yet can punish theeâ Fulv. Ah! CÃ¦sar, If you love Fulvia, let her now depart, My presence but disturbs you. [rises. Val. Yet remain; Thou see'st my just resentment. Sit, and mark How proofs shall yet confound this stubborn traitor. Ãt. O faithless woman! [aside. Fulv. Could I but assure him My cruelty is feign'd! [aside, sits again. Max. All yet goes well. [aside. Val. Ãtius, be innocent of every crime; And let Augustus, envious of thy glory, Invent this calumny; yet from thy heart Declare without reserve, (at least in this Be Ãtius his own judge,) is not the subject, Who dares in love contend with him who reigns, A rebel to his prince? Ãt. And is not he Who dares in love invade another's right, A tyrant to his subject? Val. Think'st thou then That Fulvia loves thee? Fulv. O my breaking heart! [aside. Val. Relieve him, dearest Fulvia, from the vain And fond deception: say if Valentinian Was thy first love, and ever still remains Sole partner of thy heart. Fulv. What CÃ¦sar speaks, That Fulvia must confirm. [to Val. Ãt. O! perjur'd woman! This stroke indeed has baffled all my firmness. Val. See how thy hopes deceive thee. [to Ãt. Ãt. Do not triumph, Nor trust the faith of an inconstant woman; To her I leave my vengeance;âyes, I feel A secret hope, that CÃ¦sar, for my wrongs, Will prove the faith of Fulvia. Fulv. Must I still Conceal my anguish! [aside. Max. Fulvia, yet be constant. [aside. Ãt. Scarce Ãtius knows himself; before her presence My heart is rent. O! never, Maximus, Since first I breath'd this air, my soul has felt Such pangs of warring passion! [to Max. Fulv. 'Tis too much; I cannot bear the thoughtâ [going, weeps. Val. What do'st thou, Fulvia? Fulv. I must retireâsuch trial far outweighs My sex's constancy. Val. Yet stay, and punish This rival's insolence. Fulv. In pity, CÃ¦sar, Permit me to retire. Val. It must not be, Once more, for CÃ¦sar's sake, declare thy love Is only mine, that I am all to Fulvia, And that she sees with joy the pangs of Ãtius. Fulv. But say 'twere false, and Ãtius all my happiness. Val. What say'st thou? Max. Ha! Ãt. I breathe again. Fulv. How long Must I dissemble? Yes, to appease your anger, CÃ¦sar, I veil'd my thoughts: I hop'd to save The guiltless Ãtiusâ'twas for him alone I bore these strugglesâknow the love of CÃ¦sar Ne'er touch'd this faithful bosom; if my lips Could speak to you of love, believe them not, Augustus, they deceiv'd you. Ãt. Joyful sounds! Val. Where am I! Did I hear thee right? Ingrate! Presumptuous Fulvia? Ãt. Now, whose hopes deceive him! [to Val. Val. Rash man! ungrateful Fulvia! Guards! remove That traitor from my presence: plunge him deep In some most horrid dungeon, there reserv'd For my revenge. [rises. Ãt. Thy rage is Ãtius' glory. What bliss can equal mine? for this I yield The palms of every conquest: I despise Thy boast of empire: nothing now remains To crown my vows; not Attila subdu'd Gave equal transport to this hour of triumph. With joy I now receive my chains, With joy I meet death's sharpest pains, Thy bosom still its truth maintains. [to Fulv. Thy fortune yields to mine. [to Val. Dear idol of my heart, adieu! [to Fulv. With pity now thy Ãtius view; Think how my error past I rue, That injur'd love like thine. [Exit, guarded. SCENE XV. Valentinian, Maximus, Fulvia. Val. Ungrateful woman! have I e'er deserv'd From thee such recompense? Behold, my friend, What faith thy daughter guards for Valentinian. Max. Unworthy girl! where didst thou learn deceit? Thus dost thou imitate thy father's truth? Hast thou from my exampleâ Fulv. Cease, my father, Ah! tempt me not too far, the reins are loose, And if thou urgest stillâthese lipsâ Max. Be silent: Thy blood shall elseâ Val. Hold, Maximus, my vengeance Shall find a surer way; since she detests me, Since I'm so hateful to her, I will wed her, And marriage be her punishment. Fulv. O! neverâ Banish that thought. Val. Ha! know'st thou not my power? Fulv. I know thy power may take this hated life, But seeks in vain to shake my stedfast soul: My sufferings long have banish'd every fear. No force can move this constant breast, When, hope, no longer here a guest, With every fear is lost. Such now is Fulvia's wretched state, She scorns alike thy threats, thy hate, And dreads thy pity most. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Valentinian, Maximus. Max. Now to dissemble. [aside.] Never to my shame, Augustus, shall she liveâThis hand, even now, Shall pierce her faithless heart. [going. Val. O! hold, my friend, If Fulvia dies, I shall not long survive: Even yet she may repent. Max. Thy will, great Sir, Reluctant I obey, though justice bids me Exact the punishment. Val. Why, Maximus, Why differs thus thy daughter's soul from thine? Max. While shame in every feature glows, Nor calm, nor peace this bosom knows; Methinks the indignant world surveys A daughter, who her faith betrays, And cry, that from a father's art, She learn'd to act the treacherous part. [Exit. SCENE XVII. Valentinian alone. Val. Ah! whither would ye lead me now, disdain, Love, jealousy, and all the cares of empire? At once I feel myself a foe, a lover, Incens'd and yet irresoluteâMeantime I pardon not nor punish. Well I know Honour should drive this Fulvia from my heart. From her my evils spring: but ah! I dare not Attempt the conquest, such an unknown power Weighs down my soul, and even endears my chains! Ah! What avails imperial sway While, still to rebel thoughts a prey, I feed those tyrants in my breast, The passions that destroy my rest. But though my hapless state I own, I blame not Fate nor Love, 'Tis from my fault I feel alone The cruel pangs I prove. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A hall of a prison, several passages leading to different dungeons. Guards at the entrance of the dungeons. Enter Honoria. [entering, to a guard.] Let Ãtius be conducted hitherâSee The imperial signet speaks the will of CÃ¦sar. âHis danger gives new ardour to my passion, And pity for his suffering fans the flame That glows within me, till the united force Of love and soft compassion in my breast Is but a sole affection. See he comes! With what a haughty mien and firm deportment! He must be innocent, or never, never, Can outward looks bespeak the secret heart. SCENE II. Enter Ãtius in chains, from one of the dungeons, guards attending. Ãt. [advancing to Hon.] These are thy brother's gifts. [shews his chains. Couldst thou, Honoria, Have e'er believ'd what now thy eyes behold? A few short moments change the fate of Ãtius: At setting sun thou saw'st me crown'd with laurels, And seest me, with the dawning day, in chains. Hon. Ãtius, each mortal born must feel the force Of Fortune's sway. Thou art not leader, first To prove her fickle change. It rests with thee To amend her late injustice: at my suit, CÃ¦sar forgets his wrath; he loves thee, Ãtius, Forgives the past, and claims thee for his friend. Ãt. Can it be possible? Hon. Yes: CÃ¦sar asks This sole return; secure his future peace: Disclose the secret plan of impious treason, And thou art free. What less can CÃ¦sar ask? Ãt. Little indeed he seeksâHe wills that Ãtius Accuse himself through fear: my innocence Must be the sacrifice to raise his pride, And make him seem more generous; well he knows My loyal truth, and blushes thus to wrong me: Hence would he wish to find me criminal, Or see my death. Hon. Let not thy haughty spirit Thus justify his anger: if thou art innocent, With modest, calm demeanour, plead thy cause, Take from him every power to find thee guilty, Nor leave to CÃ¦sar courage to condemn thee. Ãt. I have not yet, Honoria, learnt such baseness To save a wretched life. Hon. Thou runn'st on death. Ãt. Then let me die: death is not sure the worst Of human ills, which frees us from the converse Of wicked men. Hon. Thou shouldst consider, Ãtius, Thou yet hast liv'd but little for thy country. Ãt. We must not measure life by years, but deeds; The base, Honoria, useless to mankind, And worthless to themselves, who never felt The godlike flame of glory, though they drag An age of being, cannot boast they live. But those, who tread the paths, which I have trod, Though short their date of life have liv'd enough. Hon. If thy own safety cannot move thee, Ãtius, Think of my peaceâ Ãt. What say'st thou? Hon. YesâI love theeâ I can no more dissembleâwhen I fear The loss of Ãtius, I forget my wrongs, And pride of rank but little guards my weakness. Ãt. And is Honoria one that counsels Ãtius To learn humility? By such distinction She but inflames his pride. O! could I bend My soul to love, as I admire, thy virtueâ Then suffer me to die, the heart that feels Another wound, would live to thee ungrateful. Hon. Live, though ingrateâtake from me every hope, Despise me still, be cruel stillâbut live: Or if thou hatest life, as dear to me, Yet seek a death more worthy of thy courage, And die a conqueror, wielding glorious arms, Envied, not pitied by the gazing world. Ãt. In prison, or in battle, Ãtius knows To give a great example how to die: Even here my fate shall kindle virtuous envy. Mark if this visage guilt displays, Then say what thoughts my death shall raise, What breast shall feel for Ãtius' pains. A noble mind, in suffering prov'd, Serenely firm, can bear unmov'd, When undeserv'd, reproach and chains. [Exit to the dungeon, guarded. Hon. Heavens! what undaunted courage! to the last He meets his fate with triumph! how I tremble! SCENE III. Enter Valentinian. Val. My sister, hast thou aught obtain'd from Ãtius? Does he relent? Hon. O no! he's still unshaken. Val. This I foresaw: then let him bear the forfeit; 'Twere now beneath my dignity to save him. Hon. And yet I cannot think him criminal: Such firmness argues sure a mind unspotted. Val. It rather proves his guilt; the traitor trusts In popular opinionâhe shall die. Hon. Think better, CÃ¦sar, Ãtius dead may prove A foe more to be fear'd than Ãtius living. Val. What would'st thou counsel then? Hon. Seek out some way To bend his stubborn temper; try by mildness To wrest his secret from him. Val. Say, what means Have I not prov'd? Hon. The only certain means. Ãtius I see in love is vulnerable: You must assail him there: he dotes on Fulvia; Make him this sacrifice; resign her to him. Val. How easy 'tis to give to others counsel Which pains not the adviser. Hon. Sir, my counsel Holds forth my own example: know I love No less than thee: with thee I lose my all: Thy heart is Fulvia's, and I sigh for Ãtius. Val. Dost thou love Ãtius? Hon. O! too well I love him: Judge if I gave thee then so lightly counsel. Val. Hard is the task my sister now enjoins. Hon. Thy courage and thy virtue both united Shall shame thy fortune. Let a woman teach Augustus fortitude. Val. O Heaven! Hon. Be now The victor o'er thyself, and let thy subjects Learn hence the heart of CÃ¦sar. Val. 'Tis enough: Send Fulvia hitherâthis shall too be tried. O! didst thou know the struggle of my soul, How hard the contest! Hon. From my own too well I feel thy sufferings: yet submit to bear them: 'Tis some relief to know, that not alone We feel those pangs, in which another shares. Thou sigh'st for an ungrateful maid: Behold my love alike repaid. We both, alas! one fortune prove, Both find an equal foe in love. If I was born to cureless pains, And if for thee no hope remains, Let both an equal courage show, As both have felt an equal woe. [Exit. SCENE IV. Valentinian alone. Call Varus to me straight. [to an attendant without.] If he refuse To yield to this excess of clemency, He shall not live a moment. Enter Varus. Varus. CÃ¦sar. Val. Hear me; Dispose thy trustiest soldiers near conceal'd In the dark dungeon's entrance; and when Ãtius Shall quit this place, if thou behold'st him singly, And issue unaccompanied by CÃ¦sar, Let him be slain. Varus. I shall obey: but know'st thou What tumult has been rais'd by Ãtius' seizure? Val. I know it allâfor this has Maximus Provided well. Varus. 'Tis trueâbut yet I fearâ Val. No moreâobey my will, and take good heed The deed be secret, dost thou understand me? Varus. I understand thee well. [Exit. SCENE V. Valentinian alone. [to the guards at the dungeon.] Bring once again The prisoner hither. Hence my just resentment! Deep in my heart be now my hatred buried, Nor let my looks betray the war within. With storms beneath its treacherous breast, Oft ocean seems compos'd to rest, While zephyr breathes in gentle gales And universal calm prevails. But if that fiery soul again Reject my grace with proud disdain, I give my just revenge the rein. SCENE VI. Enter Maximus. Max. All tumult is appeas'd, and CÃ¦sar now May hasten, at his will, the fate of Ãtius: Rome will applaud, and all thy friends expect it. Val. What mean'st thou, Maximus? 'twill then be said That Valentinian is a rude barbarian, Impious, unjustâit fits us now to follow Another bright example. Max. Wherefore! sayâ Val. Peace: Ãtius comes. SCENE VII. Enter Ãtius in chains. Max. What counsel thus has mov'd him? [aside. Ãt. Call'd from my dungeon, here I came, prepar'd To meet a punishment unmerited, But find a greaterâI behold Augustus. Val. [aside.] Unheard-of boldness!âÃtius, let us speak No more of hatred.âSee me now thy friend: My rigour I detest and come resolv'dâ Ãt. I know it wellâthe rest I'm not to learn, Honoria has prevented thee: enough: If thou hast nothing further to impart, I shall regain my prisonâbut even now I commun'd with Honoria. Val. Yet she knew not What Valentinian means to offer Ãtius. Ãt. I heard it all: she nam'd my liberty, The former friendship and the love of CÃ¦sar, Thy purpos'd gifts. Val. Yet she conceal'd the greatest. SCENE VIII. Enter Fulvia. Behold that gift. [pointing to Fulv. Ãt. Fulvia! Max. What can this mean! My soul is chill'd. [aside. Fulv. Would CÃ¦sar aught with Fulvia? Val. [to her.] Attend in silence. [to Ãt.] Such a proferr'd blessing Excites thy wonder: it exceeds belief: But all thy fears are vain: my word is given, And thus confirm'd. Ãtius, receive her hand Ãt. What sacrifice is ask'd from me to ensure The dear possession here? Val. I ask but little: Through love thou art guilty; and who lives a lover, With ease forgives such guilt: I ask but this; Truth undisguis'd: reveal thy whole design; Let me entreat thee: let not CÃ¦sar still Be girt with constant fears. Ãt. My love, farewell! [to Fulvia. Lead once more to my prison. Val. Shall I then Endure such insolence? [aside. Fulv. Alas! Val. Yet hear meâ [to Ãtius. And wilt thou thus, still obstinate in silence, Forsake that Fulvia, prov'd to thee so faithful? Speak, Ãtius!âYet the traitor answers not. [aside. Max. What danger threatens! [aside. Val. Dost thou hear me, Ãtius? Know'st thou to thee I speak? Are words of mine Such as a criminal like thee should scorn? Ãt. In speaking thus, thou canst not speak to Ãtius. Val. [aside.] 'Tis now resolv'dâGuardsâ Fulv. [to Val.] Let your anger first Be turn'd on me. Val. [to Fulv.] Canst thou not yet be silent?â Release the prisoner. [his chains are taken off. Ãt. Ha! Fulv. What do I see! Max. O Heavens! Val. At length I know thy innocence: Such firmness to reject a spouse belov'd, Dwells not with him that's guiltyâI repent My rigour, Ãtius; but succeeding gifts Shall heal the unjust offence of past suspicionâ GoâFulvia is thy ownâand thou art free. Fulv. O happy change! Ãt. Now, now, indeed my soul First feels confusionâWho could e'er have hop'd Such virtues in a rival and a monarch? Thus to resign the treasure of his soul, Thus to forgetâ Val. Haste thenâImpatient Rome Expects thy presence: bless her longing sight; Banish her fears: there will be time enough For fair exchange of mutual love and friendship. Ãt. I blush to recollect my late demeanourâ A gift like this, Augustusâ Val. Ãtius, go And learn henceforth the heart of Valentinian. Ãt. Since CÃ¦sar gives me life, this hand Shall CÃ¦sar's sway maintain O'er gelid Scythia's freezing land, Or Ãthiop's parch'd domain. To bid for thee fresh laurels bloom Again my labours see: The war's stern perils I'll resume, To bleed or die for thee. [Exit. SCENE IX. Valentinian, Fulvia, Maximus. Val. Go then and take thy fate. [aside. Max. My hopes are lost! [aside. Fulv. Most generous prince! on thee may righteous Heaven Return that happiness thou giv'st to Fulvia! Thy goodness ever shall be treasur'd here; Yet, ah! permit me on this sacred hand To seal my grateful vows. Val. No, Fulviaâstay, Be first my gift complete: thou know'st not yet How far it leaves thy every vow behind, How far exceeds thy hopes. Max. What dost thou, CÃ¦sar? This mercy now misleads thee. Val. Thou shalt see That mercy not misleads, nor CÃ¦sar errs; All cares and fears shall end. Max. What peace can follow If Ãtius be releas'd? SCENE X. Enter Varus. Val. Varus, is now My will obey'd? Varus. CÃ¦sar, thy will's obey'd, Ãtius is dead. Fulv. What say'st thou! Ãtius dead! Varus. My faithful soldiers in the pass surpris'd him, Nor had he time for fear, his breast transfix'd Receiv'd the weapon's pointâhe groan'd and fell! Max. O unexpected chance! [aside. Fulv. O! Heavens! I faintâ [leans against the scene. Val. Haste, hide from every eye his bloody vestments, And let the death of Ãtius be conceal'd From each that owns his cause. Varus. It shall be done. [Exit. Val. And still is Fulvia silent? 'Tis thy time To speakâand wherefore dost thou now forbear To praise this generous prince? Fulv. Inhuman tyrant! I cannot speakâunhappy, wretched Ãtius! Max. Permit her, CÃ¦sar, for awhile to indulge The first impulse of grief. SCENE XI. Enter Honoria. Hon. Most gladsome tidings I bring to CÃ¦sar's ear. Val. What says Honoria? Her cheerful looks betoken happiness. Hon. Ãtius is innocent. Val. How! innocent! Hon. Ãmilius has confess'd.âI found the traitor Conceal'd in my apartment, parting life Scarce breathing on his lips. Max. Distracting chance! [aside. Val. In thy apartment? Hon. Yes: wounded by thee, He there had lurk'd the live-long night conceal'd: From him I learn'd the innocence of Ãtius: The dying, CÃ¦sar, never can deceive us. Val. But did he not reveal the wretch whose guilt Urg'd him to CÃ¦sar's death? Hon. He said, the guilty Was one most dear to CÃ¦sar, one by him Injur'd in love. Val. His name? Hon. He strove to speak it, Collecting on his lips his fleeting soul, But buried with a sigh the name within him. Val. O inauspicious fate! Max. O dangerous trial! [aside. Fulv. Now, tyrant, speakâsay was my consort guilty? Or justly punish'd? What avails to me Thy vain regret for Ãtius innocent? Who, cruel man, shall now restore his life? Hon. What say'st thou, Fulvia? Ãtius dead! Fulv. He's dead! Ah! princess, fly thy barbarous brother's sight; A ruthless savage, that delights in blood, In guiltless bloodâlet him be shunn'd by each; He mocks at all remorseâhe knows no horror For such a deed; forgets his fame, his honour; Thy life, Honoria, is not safe. Hon. Inhuman! And could'st thou thenâ Val. Alas! forbear, Honoria, Insult me notâI know, I own my crime; But ah! I merit pity more than blame. Yet counsel now my fears: all present here Are dearest to my heart; in which of these Shall I explore the traitor? When, alas! I know not which of these I e'er have wrong'd? Hon. Not wrong'd!âThen let thy thoughts recall the past, Remember Maximus his spouse: remember Thy love that laid its snares for female honour. Max. What means to save me now! [aside. Val. And must I think That mindless of my favours since conferr'd, His soul still broods relentless o'er a vain And youthful transport? Hon. Know'st thou not the offender Forgets the offense he gave, the offended never? Fulv. What danger threats my father! [aside. Val. Ah! too truly Thou speak'st, but say, in this extreme, Honoria, What course remains? Hon. Com'st thou to me for counsel? Since thou alone hast brought this evil on thee, Be it thine alone, O tyrant! now to heal it. [Exit. SCENE XII. Valentinian, Maximus, Fulvia. Max. CÃ¦sar, thou ill repay'st my loyal truth, If thou suspect'st it now. Val. Honoria's words Have rouz'd me from my lethargy: the occasion Calls on thee, Maximus, to clear thy honour; Since still the criminal remains conceal'd, In thee I must believe him. Max. Wherefore, CÃ¦sar? What deed of mine? Must then Honoria fix The guilt of Maximus?âIs this thy justice? Fulv. Unhappy father! Val. Certain are my fears. Ãmilius, dying, nam'd the traitor one Dear to my heart; one whom I wrong'd in love: All this too plainly, Maximus, to thee Refers, to thee aloneâIf thou art guiltless Produce the proofs; meanwhile my safety bids Secure thy personâ Fulv. [aside.] Gracious powers! assist me. Val. What other bosom could have nurs'd such treason? Ho, guards! Fulv. [to Val.] Barbarian, hearâ'tis I am guilty: I to Ãmilius gave the deathful charge; I am that hapless one so dear to CÃ¦sar; I, cruel man, am one you wrong'd in love, When late you profferr'd Ãtius to Honoria. Had not the stars been adverse to my wishes, Vengeance had now been mine, my spouse had reign'd, The world and Rome no longer then had groan'd Beneath a tyrant's heart and powerless hand: Delusive hopes and unpropitious stars! Max. [aside.] O! pious fraud! Val. My soul is lost with wonder! Fulv. [aside.] Save but my father, perish all mankind. Val. [to Fulv.] Could'st thou contrive, pursue so black a treason, And canst thou own it too? Fulv. The guiltless Ãtius Dies for my crime, and shall I suffer too My father innocent to die for Fulvia? Val. Then Maximus at least is true? Max. Augustus, I now am criminalâSince impious she Has in oblivion steep'd her sacred faith, The father's guilty in the daughter's crime. Punishâsecure thy safety with my death: That partial love, which every bosom feels For its own offspring, may some future day Corrupt a father's truth. Val. Fate, as thou wilt Dispose me now, I yield me to thy mercy: I'm weary of suspense: if life demand Such anxious cares, it is not worth my keepingâ In these extremes of doubt I find new courage, And resolution strengthens from despair. Where'er I turn intruding fear Would shew some unthought danger near: This painful being let me close, And with it end the sufferer's woes. 'Tis better sure at once to die Than thus to drag mortality, When hope and peace alike must end; My mistress lost and lost my friend. [Exit. SCENE XIII. Maximus, Fulvia. Max. At length he's gone. By thee I live, my daughter, By thee I breatheâHow did I struggle late To hide my tender feelings! Let me now, O let me clasp thee to my eager bosom, My hope, my dear support, my life's preserver! [would embrace her. Fulv. Away, inhuman father! [drawing back. Max. Why, my daughter, Why dost thou shun me thus? Fulv. All, all my sufferings I date from theeâSuffice it, that to save thee I have accus'd myself: O! hence, nor call To my remembrance what for thee I've lost, What by thy guilt I am, and what thou art. Max. And would'st thou still forbid a grateful father To pay love's faithful tributeâcomeâ [would embrace her. Fulv. In pity Leave me at peaceâIf thou would'st prove thee grateful, Unsheath thy sword, my father, kill me, kill me: With tears a daughter begs this recompense, Begs from a parent whom she has preserv'd. Max. No more with causeless anguish grieve, Those gushing drops restrain; By thee secur'd I life receive, And thou by me shalt reign. For thee a tyrant's blood shall flow; A kingdom shall return The great reward for every woe We unreveng'd have borne. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Fulvia alone. Wretch that I am! Is this the air of Tiber That Fulvia breathes? Or rove I through the paths Of Thebes and Argos? Or from Grecian shores, Fertile in impious deeds, domestic furies, From Cadmus' or Atrides' fatal race, Have visited these climes; while there a stern Ungrateful monarch fills my soul with horror, A barbarous father here, with treacherous guilt, Freezes the springs of life; and ever present A guiltless husband skims before my sight! O fatal images! O dire remembrance! Distracting thoughts, yet still I breathe and live! In anguish while my tongue complains, My heart is torn with racking pains, Through every part the frenzy flies. I call on Heaven to end my woe, Unpitying Heaven with-holds the blow, Nor sends the forky bolt below, But to my prayer the bolt denies. [Exit. SCENE XV. The capitol. A crowd of people. Maximus without his mantle, Conspirators. Tremble, O Rome! the dread of Attila, The unconquer'd chief, thy great deliverer falls, And falls by whom? The envy of Augustus Has murder'd Ãtius: such rewards as these A tyrant's hand bestows. What hope is ours From him whose rage oppresses worth like this? Romans, revenge your hero: call to mind Your ancient glory; from a shameful yoke Release your country; from impending danger Defend your fame, yourselves, your wives and children. [going. SCENE XVI. Enter Varus. Varus. Hold, Maximus, what more than rebel madness Inflames thee thus? Max. Cease, Varus, or consent To aid my purposeâAll who love their country Unsheath the sword and followâLo! the place [pointing to the capitol, all draw their swords. Shall give to Rome her freedom and dominion. [Exit with the rest towards the capitol. SCENE XVII. Varus alone. O! impious man; he leads to death the guiltless, Then calls on Rome to avenge his own misdeeds. Go thenâbut such designs shall fatal prove To him whose heart conceiv'd themâTraitor, go! âBut hark! what sudden tumult fills my ears. [trumpets and alarms. From yonder capitol afar Is heard the clashing din of war, A thousand soldiers' shouts in air Their mingled clamours blend. What now remains? O! let me prove Whate'er the generous breast can move, Of social truth or loyal love, The subject or the friend. [Exit. SCENE XVIII. The imperial guards are seen descending from the capitol fighting with the conspirators. The skirmish over, Valentinian appears without his mantle, defending himself with his drawn sword against two of the conspirators. Enter Maximus with his sword drawn. Val. Ah! traitors!â[sees Max.] Welcome, friend, thou com'st in time To give thy sovereign aid. [to Max. Max. [to his party.] Forbearâ'tis mine To take the tyrant's life. SCENE XIX. Enter Fulvia. Fulv. What means my father? Max. To punish tyranny. Val. Is this the faith Of Maximus? Max. Enough have I dissembled: What though Ãmilius ill perform'd my bidding, Thou by this hand shalt perish. Val. Impious traitor! Fulv. That sword shall never reach the breast of CÃ¦sar Till first a father takes his daughter's life. Max. Augustus, perish! SCENE XX. Enter Ãtius, Varus, with swords drawn, and soldiers. Ãt., Varus. No, Augustus, live! Fulv. Ãtius! Val. What do I see! Max. Unlook'd-for chance! [throws away his sword. SCENE LAST. Enter Honoria. Hon. Is CÃ¦sar safe? Val. Behold by whom he lives. [points to Ãt. Hon. [to Ãt.] What God, O chief, preserv'd thy life? Ãt. The zeal And piety of Varus. Val. How! Varus. I feign'd His death completedâI deceiv'd thee, CÃ¦sar, But sav'd in Ãtius thy deliverer. Fulv. O fair deceit! Ãt. Heaven justly has decreed you To owe your days, O CÃ¦sar, to the hand You deem'd unfaithfulâLiveâfor Ãtius seeks No nobler triumph, and if still your mind Harbours the smallest doubt of Ãtius' loyalty, Behold him once again a yielded prisoner. Val. Exalted hero! 'tis thyself alone Can equal worth like thine: clasp'd to my breast, Receive this pledge of penitence and love. Behold thy bride. Honoria shall prepare To be the spouse of Attila: I know She gladly will resign thy generous hand To constant Fulvia. Hon. To such matchless truth This sacrifice is little. Ãt. Happy hour! Fulv. Transporting pleasure! Ãt. At our prayers, Augustus, Grant Varus pardon, Maximus his life. Val. To such a pleader nothing is denied. Chorus. In life's uncertain track 'tis given The mind of erring man to stray, But Innocence, the star from Heaven, Directs through shades our doubtful way. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
