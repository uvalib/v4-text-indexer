      <field name="fulltext">PART I. SCENE I. AN immense chain of mountains, down which torrents rush impetuously. An Indian discovered climbing a precipice, from which issues a cataract, that undermines the projection he has gained, and he is carried away with the torrentâANOTHER, viewing his fate, seeks for shelter in a tree, which, being struck by a column of fire, is consumed, and he falls.âAlonzo, his page Juan, and Diego, are discovered descending different parts of the mountains in the utmost distressâthunder, light'ning, wind, rain, &amp;c.âsometimes they are visible, at others obscured.âAt length Alonzo descends, deprived of guides and companions. TRIO. Alonzo. Wandering beneath a dreary sky, What varied wrecks I'm doom'd to see; Lost in yon gulph my Indians lye, Their last bequest, wild misery! Perish'd alas! my friend, my guide! Juan (poor youth) my faithful page! (The Page descends assisted by Diego.) Diego. Master! Juan. âAlonzo! Diego and Juan. âValour's pride! Juan. The tempests wild, thy prayers assuage, Behold! the clouds dispersing fly! Alonzo. Ah, me! what havock here is made. Juan. I faint for succourâ Diego. âSo do Iâ Alonzo. Oh, death! thy stroke is but delay'd. Alonzo and Juan. We learn but from yon milder sky, Victims of hungerâwe must die. During the latter part of the trio the sky gradually clears, and a delightful calm succeedsâfatigued, and pressed by hunger and thirst, Alonzo dispatches Diego and Juan to procure fruits and water, they retire on opposite sides.âA BIRD flies across the stage, and Alonzo reclimes the mountains to kill it; but on his gaining the summit, A TYGER approachesâhe firesâthe tyger fallsâa scream is heard, and a number of Indians rush onâsome intimidated, others worshipping him.âAt length Capana (a hunter chief) with FOLLOWERS descend the mountains; and while Alonzo is endeavouring to ingratiate himself with the others, they seize and disarm himâ their chief viewing him with disdainâhe kneels supplicating. TRIO AND CHORUS. Alonzo. Pity a stranger, lost forlorn. Chief. Wretch! in thy garb a foe we trace, Destroyer of the human race, Spaniardâthy prayers but merit scorn! Alonzo. This heart ne'er pity's plea withstood, Think of a distant parent's moans! Chief. Our wives, our parents, childrens' groans, Bid this wing'd arrow drink thy blood! During this Alonzo is bound to a stake on a small eminence of the rock, and they prepare their bows and arrows to dispatch him. Alonzo. In your defence those arms I'd wield, The champion of humanity: Your friend, your brother, view in me! Female Indians Humanity then be thy shield. The Female Indians, as the men are on the point of discharging their arrows, place themselves, as a shield, before him. Chief. See Rolla our commander nigh! To him the victim we resign; His safety our's would undermine. Alonzo. See how a christian then can die! He appears ready, with intrepidity, to meet their arrowsâRolla eyes him with astonishment and admirationâas the Indians are once more preparing, OTHERS, on each side, bring on Juan and Diego bound, struggling. Alonzo. My vassals bound! hear, hear their plea, To serve your king was our design. Juan. Pity my youth. Diego. âAh, pity mine! The chief Indians now draw their arrows to the head, when Rolla, striking the earth with his lance, commands them to desist. Indians. Rolla commands, and ye are free! Rolla gives signs to liberate their prisonersâthey do so, and Alonzo is presented his arms. Alonzo. Thanks gallant chief, tho' you behold in me A Spaniard! I detest their cruelty! From Las Casas, your friend, I chearful bring, Congratulations to Ataliba your king. My fortune his, (with cruelty at strife) I offer him my allâmy swordâmy life! Exeunt Alonzo, &amp;c. On the other side of the stage ENTER Telasco, Zorai and Zulma, leading on Cora, followed by Female Indians, and her Infant Sister.â Rolla views her with the utmost affection, kneels to herâshe informs him she must not hear a repetition of his passionâhe asks why?âXaira and Priests ENTER, to whom she is deliveredâafter affectionately taking leave of her former companions, who sing the following strainâ(Rolla keeping the centre of the stage lost in sudden terror and reflection) FEMALE INDIANS CHORUS. Cora farewellâthy race cÅlestial run, Chaste as purity's self-bride elect of the sun. The priests, Cora and her family exeunt on one side of the stage, followed by Rolla in a gloomy state of distraction, gazing after Cora; the Indians, &amp;c. on the other. SCENE II. Outside View leading to the Temple of the Sun. Enter Cacique, Alonzo, Juan, and Diego. Female voices heard in the garden of the Temple of the Sun, joining in the following DUET AND CHORUS. While the sun's boundless blessings to chear us combine, To adorn his glad temple the chaplet entwine. In strains of delight, Enraptur'd unite, Soul of light! we adore thee! our consort divine! While Alonzo is listening to the above strains, Cora ENTERS, veiled, attended by her Relatives, Priests, &amp;c.âAlonzo seems struck with her figure âthe door of the temple opens, and she is received by the Priestess, &amp;c. and enters with some degree of trepidationâAlonzo's eyes following herâmusic is heard withoutâa shout of extacy from the multitude. CHORUS OF ATALIBA'S ATTENDANTS, without. âThe day's golden birth, bids us joyfully sing, âTo the god of his people, the worth of our king.â The Cacique informs Alonzo the king is near at hand, and proffers to conduct them to himâAlonzo looks mournfully towards the door Cora had entered, and follows himâDiego returns prying, and endeavours to peep through the doorâRolla rushes on wildly, looks at the temple, and fetches a sighâ seeing Diego prying, he seizes, and dashes him to the earthâDiego appears dreadfully alarmedâhe orders him to departâhe goes off much frightened âRolla appears mournfulâZorimbo, his bow-bearer, ENTERS, looks at Rolla, and shakes his head, knotting his quiposâRolla starts, and seeing him, asks his business. ZORIMBO âAIR. Oh! hapless chieftain, mournful I compose, The sad, sad history of Rolla's woes. BALLAD. The dangers of the raging fight, Undaunted Rolla dared to prove; His deeds attain'd fame's topmast height, But glory's sun now sinks in night. He yields, alas! to hopeless love! âFrom time no ray of hope appears, âThe gods his fatal wish reprove; âThe idol of his soul is theirs, âReligion claims her vows, her tears, âAnd Rolla yields to hopeless love!â E'en now the solemn signal's given, The virgins toward the temple move; Depriv'd thus of his earthly heaven, To wild despair sad Rolla driven. A victim yields to hopeless love. Rolla seems much agitated during this ballad, and goes off in perturbation, followed by Zorimbo. SCENE III. A Romantic View. Enter Diego runningâapes the conduct of Rolla to him in the former sceneâA Peruvian Flower Girl ENTERSâhe looks round with caution, and then approaches herâshe appears astonished âhe admires her flowersâtakes out a large purse, as if going to purchase some, but finds he is not in possession of a single dollar.âShe, admiring him, offers him flowersâhe receives them with extacy, and proceeding to make love, points to her golden ornamentsâshe smilesâhe speaks. RECITATIVEâDIEGO. Oh! what a roguish smile!âyes, yes (sighing) I'm done for! My blooming rose (chucking her under the chin) oh! no,âmy charming sun flower! He endeavours to engross her attention and affection âshe takes off the fillet from her head, and puts it on hisâhe struts aboutâshe smilesâhe puts his mulateer cap on herâwhile they are enjoying the exchange, Juan ENTERS, stamps with his foot, frowningly at Diego, and commands him to follow âhe does so, slyly beckoning the Peruvian after him. SCENE IV. The Inside of the Temple of the Sun. The image of the Sun upon an altar, raised some steps from the ground, on which that luminary reflects its brightest raysâthe olive branch on the altar. Emblematical Pas SeulâMiss Adams. The Youth of both Sexes, dressed in robes of light down, ENTER, with garlands to adorn the sacred columnsâas they dance round them, they encircle one another with their garlands, (this mysterious chain serving to typify the charms of that connection which the laws are to cement)â when thus in attitude, A Pas de Deux by the Miss Cabanals. A short figure ensues, and they, at the entrance of the procession, prostrate themselves inclined towards the altar.âEnter in Procession the Pontiff, High Priests, and Atalibaâthey all prostrate themselves, the king kneeling, before the altar. CHAUNTâATALIBA. Source inexhaustible of good! thy golden rays, Ripening our harvest, claim our warmest praise! Soft music heard withoutâXaira introduces the High Priestess, Virgins of the Sun, &amp;c. followed in procession by Telasco, Idali, and Zorai; between the two former Cora is placed, veiled, Priestess and Zulma holding in their hands the end of that mysterious flame coloured girdle, the sign and pledge of that spotless chastity Cora devotes herself to maintainâthe high Priestess following. CHORUSâPriestesses and Virgins in Procession. Oh, delight of the world! our celestial spouse! Divine sire of Manco, receive a bride's vows. As they arrange themselves, Rolla rushes on in the utmost agitation, followed by Zorimboâ Ataliba, &amp;c. approach the altarâCora bends before itâthe Priest unties the veilâshe, alarmed, seizes her mother's hand, and appears reluctantâTelasco bows to the altar requesting the Pontiff to proceedâ she imprints an ardent kiss on her father's cheekâ heaves a sigh, and approaches the altar nearerâ Rolla's agitation encreases. CHAUNTâHIGH PRIEST. In chastity pure as the sun's brightest rays, Unreproach'd 'till life's close must revolve Cora's days! The world's lost endearments no longer in view, She must bid to its joys an eternal adieu. Cora, much agitated, falls on the neck of her father, kisses him, and her brother, and sisterâher eye meets Rolla'sâthey tremblingly approach each other to take a last farewellâembraceâXaira, with religious awe, separates them, and she again reluctantly approaches the altar. THE PONTIFF PROCEEDS. But if our holy laws she violate, Hear trembling her, and her seducer's fate; A living grave his dreadful end will prove, A shameful death her sacrilegious love! Her sire, her brother, (kindred's dearest names) To expiate her guilt must perish in the flames; To heaven's high throne Cora religious bow, In conscious token of thy solemn vow. She, tremblingly, bends to the altarâRolla, delirious, is on the point of dispatching himself, but prevented by Zorimbo, who arrests his hand, and impells him to retire. PONTIFF to the High Priestess and Virgins. Children retireâCora, be it thy care, The sacrificial offerings to prepare! High Priestess and Virgins retire on one side with Cora, who, embracing her relatives, they retire on the otherâthe king comes forwardâENTER THE Cacique, (who had escorted Alonzo) followed by Alonzo and PageâAlonzo kneels at Ataliba's feetâpresents a pacquet, which Ataliba gives the Pontiff to peruse, then raises, and embraces himâ he waves the Pontiff forward, and pointing to the altar, the Pontiff brings down an olive branch which he presents Alonzo, who kisses it in token of peace and amity, and presents his sword and shield, which is deposited near the altarâHigh Priestess and Virgins RETURN with baskets of sacrificial breadâCora, crowned with flowers, is commanded by Xaira, and presents it to Ataliba kneeling, who commands her to present it to Alonzo âCora trembles as she offers the golden basketâ Alonzo views her with emotionâshe scarcely can prevent the basket from falling, and her trembling knees almost fail to convey her again to the Priestess, who supports herâTrumpet soundedâCapana (a Cacique) ENTERS in haste. RECITATIVEâCAPANA. Huescar, Cusco's Inca, noble chief, To every plea of amity is deaf; Our plains disfigur'd with a crimson flood, His sword already drinks your subjects' blood. ATALIBA. For retribution ev'ry bosom warms, Brave children of the sun, to arms, to arms. Warriors with their Caciques ENTER, and offer their services to Ataliba, and among the rest Alonzoâthe king beckons the Pontiff to him, and pointing to the altar, Pontiff brings forward Alonzo's sword and shield which he had deposited there âAtaliba girds on the sword, and the Pontiff presents him his shield. CHORUSâHIGH PRIEST, &amp;c. Receive brave youth and nobly wield In virtue's cause the sword and shield: Our champion, counsellor, and friend, In peace a lamb, in war a lion be, Let Conquest's consort be humanity, And Pity's feeling Valour's steps attend. A double procession of the king, warriors, &amp;c. on one side, and the Pontiff, Priests, &amp;c. on the otherâAlonzo on one side, Cora on the other, bringing up the rearâthey exchange glances of affection at parting; and at the end of the procession the scene closes, Cora kneeling in solicitation for Alonzo's safety. SCENE V. Romantic View. Rolla ENTERS gloomilyâthe sound of the trumpet heardâhis bow-bearer (Zorimbo) follows hastilyâRolla asks him the causeâhe replies RECITATIVEâZORIMBO. You ask me why Exertion's on the wing? The answer's brief, to serve heav'n and our king! Rolla receives this intelligence with the utmost satisfaction, strikes the bow he gives him on the ground, and his Troops ENTERâRolla thanks heaven he can use that life in the cause of his country which would otherwise be a burthen to him, and commands his bow-bearer to cheer the troops, (who does so) with the following SONGâZORIMBO. [1.] When our country calls to arms, Native zeal enflames each breast; Fame displays her dauntless charms, In every martial splendor drest. Yet in pity's steps we tread, Nor cruelly war's weapon lave; When a prostrate foe shall plead, Our greatest glory be to save! 2. Invasion's threat can ne're affright, Our country's wrongs will lead us on; Justice shall guide us in the fight, And mercy when the battle's won. Then, if gasping on the field Some hero draws his latest breath, To soft humanity we'll yield, And weep for a brave soldier's death. At the close of the song, Rolla marches off his troops. SCENE VI. Huescar's TentâSun RiseâMartial Music. Enter Huescarâhis Chieftains following, bearing the banners of his tribeâhe prostrates himself before the sun. RECITATIVEâAccompanied Huescar. War's banners are unfurl'd; the god of day Lights us to vengeance on Ataliba! On Cayamburo's heights encamp'd they lie, Follow your chief to death or victory. As he is leading the troops off a trumpet sounds, and Alonzo, preceded by a Herald, and followed by Peruvians, with presents, ENTER. RECITATIVEâALONZO. Monarchâthis fatal difference I would heal, This war of brothers fain would I bid cease; The bond of social amity reseal, And blend endearments with returning peace. Huescar. So says Ataliba? this answer bear, I scorn his proffers urg'd by dastard fear; Blood must be shedâmy great revenge to sate, Unnumber'd enemies shall bite the dust! Alonzo. Their blood be on thy headâI yield to fateâ Thy foe, lov'd by his people, is as good as great: That king's invincible whose cause is just! Exit WITH FOLLOWERS. Huescar. Presumptuous reptile! at the Illapa's sound, Swear on my sword! No childish pity shall your souls debase. (They swear) (Kneeling) Thou sun adored! Blood! blood alone! can heal my honour's wound! Ambition's wishes can alone be crown'd, In total extirpation of a brother's hated race. March AND EXEUNT. SCENE VII. The Plains of Cayamburo intersected with treesâthe Heights interspersed with Peruvian encampments on the back groundâthe ascent and descent rendered practicableâtowards the front of the stage a prominent rock as an out-post. Trumpets and warlike music on each sideâthe illapa soundedâdifferent warriors meetâthe standard of the sun placed by a standard-bearer on the prominence. A General Battle TAKES PLACE. Ataliba's party drive Huescar's offâZulma and her Child descend the heights, the former scarcely knowing which course to take to elude pursuers, but most interested for the safety of her child.âZorai is attacked by TWO Caciques of the opposite party âZulma draws her arrow and dispatches the chief, who is aiming a blow at Zorai, who beats off the other Caciqueâanother party attack her, she endeavours to guard her child, and receives her death wound, the child exclaiming: RECITATIVEâCHILD. Save, save her life, Telasco! father, brother; She bleeds! she dies! my mother! oh! my mother. Zulma dies in the arms of her husband and son, and is born off on the shields of their party. The general Fight re-commences. The king is surrounded, and his life preserved by Alonzo, who, being wounded, is falling under the hand of his enemies, when Rolla, (who had ascended the rock, and seized the standard of the sun, in the act of doing which he receives a gash on his forehead with a club, and an arrow in his arm) leaps from the rock at the moment Alonzo is overcome, and receives the arrow in his breast aimed at Alonzo's life by HuescarâAlonzo recovers his weapon, and attacks Huescar driving him offâA Warrior attacks Rolla, who staggers, but still retains the standard for which they struggle, and he at length conquers his opponent âAtaliba ENTERS on one side with his party, Alonzo on the other with Huescar, &amp;c. prisonersâthe characters groupe, and the prisoners, &amp;c. are marched off. SCENE VIII. The Golden Garden of the Sun. Enter Cora melancholy, her action evincing the unsettled state of her mind. Enter AMAZILLA. RecitativeâAmazilla. Ah, Cora! why so melancholy grown? Restlessâsome secret preys upon thy mind, Poor solitary bird, why flutter thus alone? The presence of the bridegroom should cheer the new made bride. Cora shrinks at the name of bridegroom, but, recovering herself, bows to the sun, trembling at the former impurity of her wishes, and, heaving a sigh, is retiring when she is met by the High Priestess. TRIO. High Priestess. Why droop sweet maid? Forbear to sigh; Must I upbraid, Fair Cora?âfye! To heav'n allied, No earthly toils (The sun's sweet bride) Should cloud thy smiles, No, Cora, no! Dispel thy fears, Impurely flow Those causeless tears, In love most pure. Your heart his throne, Our godlike sire; His love has shewn, Then live for him And him alone. Amazilla. To hail the day! And glad the night; Joy's pinions play, In calm delight. Serenely blest, No busy thought Distracts the breast With poison fraught. No, Cora, no! Th'omnifick eye Beholds thy vow With extacy, In love most pure, &amp;c. &amp;c. (Martial music heard without) Enter IDALI. Idali. In accents delighting, To pleasure inviting; Triumphant's alighting, From victory's car, Our king; whose voice cheering His subjects, revering; Brings peace! which (endearing) O'er shadows each scar! Triumph's shouts, loud resounding, (Base traitors confounding;) Name Alonzo and Rolla, Our champions in war! They join in the latter part of the verse as a trioâ Cora's features, at the name of Alonzo, brightening into a smile. Exeunt EXULTINGLY. SCENE IX. Exterior View of the Temple of the Sun, behind which is a mountainous View. Enter Ataliba in triumphâRolla and Alonzo on each side followed by Caciques, Soldiers, &amp;c. some guarding Huescar as an hostage. RECITATIVEâATALIBA. Guard well the hostage of returning peace, But treated as our kindred let him be; Misfortune claims compassion, 'twill decrease The constrain'd rigour of captivity! FINALE. Ataliba. Rolla! Alonzo! chiefs in honour's cause, Accept our thanksâa grateful monarch's prayer. He presents each with a rich embroidered scarf, as a token of affection for the services rendered him in the recent battle! Protectors of our altars, our liberty, and laws, (The people bow to them) My people view, exult with you! My people who're my children! my paternal care! Alonzo, Cacique, Juan, Chorus, and Ataliba. With heart, hand, and voice, Attune loyalty's string; A happy people's choice, Must reign a happy king! And curs'd be the traitor the golden band who'd sever, Long live my people! the king live for ever! Exeunt exultingly. The chorus dying away, Rolla returns followed by Zorimbo; he looks on the scarf bestowed on him by Ataliba, and, shaking his head, hints it only conceals a heart tortur'd with hopeless love; then gazes at the temple, intimating the object of his wishes is sequestered thereâthen sighs. ZORIMBO endeavouring to console him, Rolla forbear! why heave the hopeless sigh? Take thy last lookâ'twill wring thy tortur'd breast; By victory crown'd, a nation's wishes blest, In glory's blaze the fatal flame should die! Away! away! Madness attends your stay, Retireâretire awhile, and lull your griefs to rest! Rolla is unwillingly hurried off. ALONRO RE-ENTERS. Oh, Cora! belov'd! tho' depriv'd of thy view, My soul hovers near the abode it reveres; Oh! to hear but thy voice tho' it breath'd but adieu! To me wou'd be music more sweet than the spheres. While he is gazing on the templeâdistant thunder is heardâthe sky appears clouded, the earth agitated, the temple convulsed, and the mountainous volcano threatens an eruption. But hark! the distant thunder roars! The dark'ning sky a storm portends; Yon fiery gulph it's lava pours, In liquid flame the lake descends! The eruption commences with a dreadful crash, part of the temple gives wayâthe voices of the Virgins of the sun are heard complaining. Virgins. Oh! save us heaven! hear our moans! Alonzo. The temple totters! shrieks and groansâ Virgins. Oh! save us! Alonzo. Tell death's dreadful tale! Cora's retreat the flames assail! Shall dire destruction crush her charms? Cora. The love lorn Cora who will save? Alonzo. Her voice! I'll clasp her to my arms, Rescue or perish in her grave. Another part of the temple breakingâCora is seen clinging to a pillarâhe ascends the ruinsâshe faints in his arms, and for a period they are invisibleâ Rolla ENTERS, distracted, followed by Zorimbo. Virgins. Oh! heaven! thy pity we invoke! Zorimbo. Rolla assistance ne'er denies! See! see! he darts through clouds of smoke! Rolla rushes up the ruins followed by Zorimbo, when out of sight, Alonzo enters with Cora in his arms through a chasm in the temple. Alonzo. Open my love thine azure eyes! âTo gaze on this angelic form, âStern Virtue's self could not reprove; âMy throbbing heart 'gins her's to warm, âCora, awake to life and love! She wakes from her trance, views and embraces himâanother dreadful crashâHE BEARS HER OFF. Ataliba, Priests, &amp;c. ENTERâa variety of characters discovered supplicatingâRolla in an attitude of despair near one of the columns. SUPPLICATING CHORUS OF Ataliba, Priests, Children, and Virgins. Oh! light supreme! thy mighty power, The world's extinction can command; On us mild peace and plenty shower, Or stretch Destruction o'er the land! Whate'er our crime just punishment fulfill, We yield unmurmuring to thy godlike will. END OF THE FIRST PART.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRIO. Alonzo. Wandering beneath a dreary sky, What varied wrecks I'm doom'd to see; Lost in yon gulph my Indians lye, Their last bequest, wild misery! Perish'd alas! my friend, my guide! Juan (poor youth) my faithful page! (The Page descends assisted by Diego.) Diego. Master! Juan. âAlonzo! Diego and Juan. âValour's pride! Juan. The tempests wild, thy prayers assuage, Behold! the clouds dispersing fly! Alonzo. Ah, me! what havock here is made. Juan. I faint for succourâ Diego. âSo do Iâ Alonzo. Oh, death! thy stroke is but delay'd. Alonzo and Juan. We learn but from yon milder sky, Victims of hungerâwe must die. During the latter part of the trio the sky gradually clears, and a delightful calm succeedsâfatigued, and pressed by hunger and thirst, Alonzo dispatches Diego and Juan to procure fruits and water, they retire on opposite sides.âA BIRD flies across the stage, and Alonzo reclimes the mountains to kill it; but on his gaining the summit, A TYGER approachesâhe firesâthe tyger fallsâa scream is heard, and a number of Indians rush onâsome intimidated, others worshipping him.âAt length Capana (a hunter chief) with FOLLOWERS descend the mountains; and while Alonzo is endeavouring to ingratiate himself with the others, they seize and disarm himâ their chief viewing him with disdainâhe kneels supplicating. TRIO AND CHORUS. Alonzo. Pity a stranger, lost forlorn. Chief. Wretch! in thy garb a foe we trace, Destroyer of the human race, Spaniardâthy prayers but merit scorn! Alonzo. This heart ne'er pity's plea withstood, Think of a distant parent's moans! Chief. Our wives, our parents, childrens' groans, Bid this wing'd arrow drink thy blood! During this Alonzo is bound to a stake on a small eminence of the rock, and they prepare their bows and arrows to dispatch him. Alonzo. In your defence those arms I'd wield, The champion of humanity: Your friend, your brother, view in me! Female Indians Humanity then be thy shield. The Female Indians, as the men are on the point of discharging their arrows, place themselves, as a shield, before him. Chief. See Rolla our commander nigh! To him the victim we resign; His safety our's would undermine. Alonzo. See how a christian then can die! He appears ready, with intrepidity, to meet their arrowsâRolla eyes him with astonishment and admirationâas the Indians are once more preparing, OTHERS, on each side, bring on Juan and Diego bound, struggling. Alonzo. My vassals bound! hear, hear their plea, To serve your king was our design. Juan. Pity my youth. Diego. âAh, pity mine! The chief Indians now draw their arrows to the head, when Rolla, striking the earth with his lance, commands them to desist. Indians. Rolla commands, and ye are free! Rolla gives signs to liberate their prisonersâthey do so, and Alonzo is presented his arms. Alonzo. Thanks gallant chief, tho' you behold in me A Spaniard! I detest their cruelty! From Las Casas, your friend, I chearful bring, Congratulations to Ataliba your king. My fortune his, (with cruelty at strife) I offer him my allâmy swordâmy life!</field>

BANK and arbourâmoonlightâa monument consecrated to Zulma, Cora's mother, adorned with palm branches, flowers, &amp;c.âAlonzo and Cora discovered asleep on the bankâEnter Juan, he looks at them and sighs. AIRâJUAN. [1.] Thus balmy sleep distrust beguiles, Reflection, terror would impart; The face now deck'd in roseate smiles, Conceals, alas! an aching heart! 2. Religion vainly did essay, Fair nature's dictates to reprove; Too weak, alas! its strongest plea, Oppos'd to gratitude and love. He goes off pitying the loversâCora awakesâ she gazes on Alonzo with the strongest marks of affection, kissing him, &amp;c.âA supernatural noise is heard, and the following words sung, Cora!âCora!âCora! Cora appears all agitationâthe tomb opens, and the spectre of her mother, Zulma, ascends looking mournfully at her daughter, and singing the following sentence: False, false to thy vows, Cora heave the deep sigh, Prepare! for the guilty, the guiltless must die! PATHETIC AIR. From the silence of death and the grave, Pallid Zulma again views the light; To pity alas! but not save, The victim of lawless delight! âView the funeral pile of thy sire! âThy lover condemn'd to the flame! âThy long honor'd race all expire, âDeath's pangs made more poignant by shame.â False, false to thy vows, Cora heave the deep sigh, For the guilty, the guiltless unpitied must die! Zulma ascends during the airâCora endeavours to awaken Alonzo, who, as Zulma goes out of sight, starts up and receives the fainting Cora in his arms, and bears her off. SCENE II. A Romantic View. Enter Cora and Alonzo much agitatedâhe endeavours to console her, but cannot erase the recollection of her mother's vision. JUAN ENTERS hastily. RECITATIVEâJUAN. Xaira, the priest, hies hither thro' the glade, Alonzo! fly! or Cora is betray'd! Alonzo, kissing Cora's hand, precipitately quits her at the approach of Xaira and the High Priest, to whom Cora tremblingly bows. RECITATIVEâHIGH PRIEST. Cora! our trouble's o'er! 'tis you we seek, The only wanderer of our temple's wreck. Cora, occasionally looking after Alonzo, endeavours to extricate herself from the hands of the priests, in which exertion she loses her bracelet, but is hurried off. Enter STANDARD-BEARER and DIEGO. RECITATIVEâSTANDARD-BEARER. Oh! what a plague is love, and this love-making, Poor Rolla! see! is in a piteous taking! Sometimes a ghastly smile!âsometimes he's sad! Sometimes he's mopingânow he's raving mad! Exeunt. Enter Rolla wildly, discovers the braceletâ Alonzo's voice is heard singing the following couplet: Oh, Cora! thy absence embitters love's strain, Distraction reigns here 'till I view thee again. Rolla listens with profound attention to the exclamation, and makes his EXIT in a paroxysm of uncertainty and despair. SCENE III. A Wild Woody Country, where the bushes and underwoods are so closely entwined as to be almost impenetrableâin the back ground a wall, (in which a large breach has been made,) is just discernible through the trees, and farther back rises the cupola of the Temple of the Sunânearer the front on the right hand appears a caveâon the left a hill, the top part of which is seen above the trees. Rolla comes down a winding path, among the bushes, followed by Zorimboâwhen Rolla arrives at the Cave's mouth, he requests Zorimbo to retire, informing him there he will take up his abodeâthat shall be his graveâthere he will breathe out a life that love has rendered miserableâoccasionally gazing on the temple which contains his soul's idolâ Zorimbo attempts to soothe him, but he assumes a wild air, commanding him to depart, which he does mournfully, repeating the following accompanied recitative. ZORIMBO. And this is Rolla's dwelling? a dark cave! Within whose limits he would find a grave; In his last gasp enraptur'd wou'd appear, If but embalm'd with Cora's pitying tear! Rolla rushes into the CavernâENTER Diego with great caution, followed by Alonzo and Juan âAlonzo points to the breach in the wall, and commands them to be upon the watchâthey retire âgoing towards it he hears a clapping of hands, he intimates 'tis Cora's signalâsprings over the ruins, reaches his hand to Cora who follows him, he assisting her over the wallâwhen brought down towards the front of the stage he presses her to his bosomâshe affectionately returns the embraceâon recollection he shuddersâfixes his eyes on the ground, with terror in his countenanceâshe endeavours to sooth himâthe Incence in the altar of the cupola catches fireâshe tells him she will pray for the sun's blessing and forgiveness if they are guilty of any crime against him, and climbs hastily up the hillâAlonzo wildly following herâshe kneels, and by degrees draws him down to kneel beside herâ Rolla rushes from the Cave, fixes his eyes first wildly on the earth; then, turning them towards heaven, suddenly espies the lovers kneeling upon the hill; at sight of whom he utters a shriek of horror, and remains immoveable, as if he had seen a spirit âCora and Alonzo rise slowly with their faces still turned towards the sun, and sink into a silent embraceâRolla, overpowered, exclaims with a voice almost suffocated with anguish, âCora!!!â âthe lovers start affrighted and perceive himâ Cora sinks in a swoon on the declivity of the hillâAlonzo, endeavouring to recover her, calls for âJuan and Diego;â THEY RUSH ON, but perceiving Rolla, precipitately retire on the watchâ Alonzo, having recovered Cora, draws his sword, and rushes down the hill towards Rolla, who keeps his eyes immoveably fixed upon herâJuan arrests Alonzo's armâa pause. RECITATIVEâAlonzo. Swear by that power who reigns supreme above, You'll not betrayâ(pointing to Cora) the object of my love! A pauseâAlonzo, unsatisfied, attacks Rolla, who disarms him, and points his sword to his breastâ Cora, in anguish, rushes hastily down the hill, and throwing herself at Rolla's feet begs him to save his life, and conceal their guiltâhe muses for a whileâthen with dignity approaches the lovers, and placing Cora's hand in Alonzo's, gives them his blessing; then turning aside bursts into tearsâ a pauseâAlonzo and Cora throw their arms around himâhe embraces Alonzo; kneels and kisses Cora's hand; and swears in the face of heaven to devote his life to their service. While meditating, what plan to pursue, Cora approaches the temple; which he tells her she must quit for ever, and both secure their safety by flightâDiego ENTERS hastily, and informs them, females draw nearâIdali and Amazilla call âCora!âCora!ââand appear peeping through the breach, with great eagerness and curiosityâ Rolla regrets they are discovered. QUARTETTO. Idali. Trembling we venture chill'd with fear. Amazilla. In search of gentle Cora hereâ Both. Our priestess asks her aid. Zorimbo. Ye pious virgins this way come, (to Virgins.)

Enter PRIESTESS. RECITATIVEâPRIESTESS. Idali! Amazilla! Cora! how they stay! Enter Idali and Amazilla, almost out of breath. Both. Oh, dear! we have been running all the way! TRIO. Priestess. Where, where could gentle Cora stray? Say, where have you the wanderer found? Idali. Lord I forgot! Amazilla. âWhat shall I say? Idali and Amazilla. In the garden we explor'd around, In the temple lost in sleep profound. Priestess. The garden!âtemple!âboth! oh, fie! You falsehood utter! Idali. âNoânot Iâ Amazilla. âNot Iâ Priestess. For which you must be more than chid. Both. I only spoke as I was bid. Priestess. Bid! what you've had advisers then? Idali. In search of Cora them we saw, La! only Spaniards, they wer'n't men. Priestess. I tremble for our holy law! O'er ruins they stole in no doubt. Idali and Amazilla. No! through the ruins we stole out, (Cora enters much agitated) Cora Alonzo's kiss reprov'd! Yet still Alonzo swore he lov'd! RECITATIVEâPRIESTESS. Cora!âAlonzo!âbase perfidious youth! Her agitation speaks the dreadful truthâ You tremble! RunaâAmazilla fly, Summon our priestsâ Exit Idali. (Cora, detaining Amazilla, seems to unburthen her mind to her, she kneels to the Priestess.) Amazilla. âCora but asks to die.

My brave Telasco, I thy loss deplore; 'Tis not our fate to be for ever bless'd; But tho' the best of mothers is no more, Her children's virtues are by all confess'd! (Introduces them to Alonzo.) Ataliba. Alonzo! Cora's father, and this youth, (Whose worth Peru can ne'er too much extol! Emblems of courage, loyalty, and truth) Covet the friendship of thy kindred soul. Alonzo appears much agitated at this introduction to Cora's father, speaks aside in the utmost terror! Alonzo. Oh, heaven! why lingers thine avenging fire! (Embracing them agitated) Be thou my brotherâthou lov'd as my sire! A distant solemn march is heard; as it nearer approaches it suddenly stops, and Cora's Sister rushes on, flies to her father and brother, and endeavours to describe the situation of her sisterâ a pauseâenter the High Priestess, followed by a train of Virgins of the Sun, clad in thick mourning veils. ACCUSATION AIR. High Priestess (throwing back her veil.) Oh, woe! woe! woe! our altars are profan'd! The holy lamp extinguish'd! tears, tears, alas! must flow! Lamentations pierce the walls, where joy so long has reign'd! An ill-fated virgin, alas! has broke her vow! The whole assembly shudderâAlonzo appears thunderstruckâthe Priestess proceeds joined by Virgins. Woe! woe! on Cora, on Cora woe! At the mention of her name the king utters a sigh of agonyâTelasco (trembling) supports himself upon his staffâZorai (full of confusion) conceals his face in his garmentâthe child (shuddering) clings to her father's kneeâAlonzo reclines, almost fainting, on Juanâthe other characters mingling, so as to form a group expressive of the utmost terror.

'tis vengeance dire we crave âOn him who abus'd hospitality's fair name! âWhose endearments were death! seduction digs his grave, âAnd the terrors of dying are doubled by shame.â A pauseâAtaliba looks much agitated towards Alonzo. Priestess proceeds accompanied by Virgins, &amp;c. Woe! woe! on Alonzo, on Alonzo woe!

CHORUS-PRIESTESS, &amp;c. âImage of the sun on earth, âOur monarch and our sire; âJustice to vengeance must give birth, âAwful atonement we require.â ALONZO (falling on his knees). Save Cora! she is innocent, 'tis I Alone am guilty, and alone shou'd die! Ataliba stands for a short period wrapt in thought. ATALIBA to Alonzo. Rise! (turns from Alonzo, and after another short struggle, addresses the guards) âGuards, your prisoner seize! The guards seize and put Alonzo in ironsâ Xaira points to the father, son, and daughterâ after another struggle he orders them likewise to be seized. Our holy laws and customs thus proclaim, That, e'er the sun illume yon eastern hills, Our Priests assemble in his holy name To judge these vile associates in vice; (How my soul shrinks at the opprobrious term!) And at the yawning grave of sacrifice Their sentence a just monarch will confirm: But ye who judge them keep this truth in view A power superior one day will judge you! The Priests all bowâAtaliba retires through the folding doorsâCora is brought on in chainsâ no longer bearing the image of the sun upon her breast, nor her flame coloured girdleâshe starts at seeing Alonzo! casts a look of awe towards Telasco âapproaches himâhe thrusts her from him with disdainâshe falls on her knees, clasping the hand of her brother, who spurns her, pointing to their chainsâshe falls on Alonzo's armâXaira summons the Priests to attend him at the temple, and separates the lovers, who are borne off on opposite sides. CHORUS OF PRIESTS, &amp;c. âDeath and shame be the portion of Cora's disgrace; âDeath and shame be Telasco's and all of his race; âDeath and shame be Alonzo's, their blood soon must flow, âWoe on Cora! her kindred! on Alonzo woe!â Exeunt. SCENE VI. AND LAST.

Ataliba. Alonzo, ere confirm'd your sentence, have you ought to plead? Alonzo. Save, save the innocent, 'tis I alone should bleed. At this period the sun risesâAtaliba prostrates himself before itâanxious attention pervades the whole assemblyâAtaliba comes forward. Ataliba. TelascoâZoraiâInfant ye are free, Heaven wills for innocence mild clemency. (They are liberated.) Xaira and Priests apparently murmurâAtaliba casts an eye of displeasure on them, and proceedsâ The laws offended, mercy here must pause, The king himself is subject to the laws. Alonzo! Cora! have ye ought to plead? They bow their heads intimating noâAtaliba commands the Priests to do their dutyâPontiff and Xaira go to the altarâone takes from it the sword, the other the palm branch, symbols of justice and mercy, and deliver them to the king. Priest. Guided by heaven your judgment be decreed! Cora and Alonzo kneelâafter a short struggle, Ataliba. Solemn and just our laws pronounce your doom, (Four guards rush on with torches, and seize Cora and Alonzo.) The glaring torch in deadly awe appears, Cora, to light thee to thy living tomb, Alonzo's heart's blood trickling with thy tears! He is on the point of raising the sword as a signal to dispatch him, when Rolla, wildly, rushes on with a drawn sabre in his right hand, a javelin in his left, and a bow and quiver at his backâhe is followed by a considerable number of Officers and Soldiers exclaiming: âMercy for Cora! with the world at strife, âTis Rolla pleads! save! save! oh, save her life! Rolla kneels, and the whole troop!âthe king endeavours to conceal his emotions and preserve his dignity.âXaira seizes CoraâRolla pushes him aside, and rushing before her, appears determined to shield her. Rolla. Mercy! mercy! Ataliba. Arm'd and ask mercy, 'tis mere mockery, Thy king disdains the armed rebel's plea! Rolla (striking his javelin on the ground) bites his lips with convulsive indignationâCora, timidly, embraces and kisses himâthen forces the sabre, &amp;c. gently from his grasp, and lays them at Ataliba's feet, making a motion to the warriors, who ground their armsâshe then draws Rolla affectionately towards Ataliba, at whose feet she throws herselfâ Rolla, after a few moments struggle, kneels by her. ATALIBA â(to Rolla). Dost thou submit? (Rolla bows in acquiescence) Then take thy forfeit lifeâpardon receive. (Rolla points to Cora, soliciting her pardon, Ataliba proceeds.) Now hear my sentence. (He again takes up the sword and palm branch he had laid down on the entry of RollaâCora and Alonzo come forwardâTelasco supports himself on ZoraiâAtaliba, after a short pause, with his right hand strikes the sword against the ground and breaks it, then with his left presents the palm branch to Cora.) Be the law abolish'dâCoraâAlonzo live! Cora swoons in Alonzo's armsâRolla springs up, and presses the king, wildly, to his breastâXaira looks down gloomilyâthe child raises her hand gratefully towards heavenâTelasco, supported by Zorai, affectionately approaches his daughter, and the people burst out in the following GRAND CHORUS. To the fountain of mercy enraptured we sing, Long, long live our Incaâlong, long live the king. FINIS.</field>
