      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, ATHENS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter TOXILUS and SAGARISTIO at a distance. TOXILUS. When first a poor man steps into the path Of love, he must worse labours undertake Than HerculesâFor I would sooner fight The hydra, lion, and Ãtolian boar, The Erymanthian stag, Stymphalian birds, Or with AntÃ¦us wrestle, than contend With loveâWhy what a miserable wretch Am I, with only hunting after money? All whom I ask, no other answer give Than, no.â Sag. [apart.] The slave, who faithfully would serve His master, on my word must treasure up A mass of things, which he may think will please him, Both when he is at home, and when abroadâ I cannot say, with chearfulness I serve him, Nor do I hit my master to a hairâ And yet, he can no more forbear to leave With me his orders, and make me the prop Of his affairs, than keep his hands from off His itching eyeâWho's this stands opposite? [seeing Toxilus. Tox. And who is this stands opposite to me? He seems like Sagaristio.â Sag. â'Tis Toxilus, My friend.â Tox. â'Tis he indeedâ Sag. I really think 'tis heâ Tox. I'll join himâ Sag. I'll up to himâ Tox. Sagaristio! May the gods love you! Sag. May they grant you, Toxilus, All that you wish!âHow fare you? Tox. As I can. Sag. What do you? Tox. Live.â Sag. But is it as you like? Tox. Ay, when I have my wishes, well enoughâ Sag. You use your friends imprudentlyâ Tox. How so?â Sag. You give them no commandsâ Tox. Why, 'troth you are Already dead to meâI have not seen you. Sag. I've been engag'dâ Tox. In the iron trade perhapsâ Sag. Ay, and above this half year have been chain'd to't, A vapulary tribune at the millsâ Tox. Why that's your old campaignâ Sag. Have you been well? Tox. Indifferentâ Sag. What makes you look so pale? Tox. In battle I've receiv'd a dang'rous wound, The god of love has pierc'd me through the heart. Sag. Do slaves presume to love? Tox. What should I do? Resist the gods, and Titan like, 'gainst heav'n Make war, and such unequal battle try? Sag. Take care the elm twig darts don't pierce your sides. Tox. I celebrate a feast of liberty, And royallyâ Sag. How so?â Tox. My master's gone Abroadâ Sag. Ay, say you so?âWhat, gone abroad? Tox. If you can bear a jovial life, come, live With meâI'll treat you like a princeâ Sag. Out on't! You make my shoulders itch to hear you talk soâ Tox. But there is one thing tortures meâ Sag. What's that? Tox. This very day's the last, that does for ever My fair one's servitude or freedom fix. Sag. And what with me? Tox. Make me your friend for ever. Sag. As how?â Tox. Why lend me but six hundred pieces, Only to buy her freedom, and the money In three or four days' time, I will return. If you're good natur'd, do in this assist me, Sag. Sauce-box! with what assurance dare you ask So great a sum of me?âWas I to sell Myself, I scarce could raise what you ask of me: Would you squeeze water from a pumice stone, The driest thing on earth!â Tox. And ought you then To use me thus? Sag. Why, what is't I should do? Tox. Ask you that question?âBorrow it from somebodyâ Sag. That you may do your selfâ Tox. Why I have tried, But can't succeed. Sag. I'll try, if any one Will give me creditâ Tox. You have means abroadâ Sag. Was it at home, I'd promis'd you before. But I'll take care to do my best, as 'tis. Tox. Come what come may, come home to meâ Sag. But be Upon the hunt yourselfâI'll be the same; And carefully will let you know how things Turn outâ Tox. I beg you, oe'r and o'er again I beg you, to be true to me in thisâ Sag. You teize me with your importunityâ Tox. It is the fault of love, it is not mine If now I talk so foolishlyâ Sag. I'll leave youâ Tox. What! are you going?â Sag. A good walk to you! Return as soon as possible I beg youâ Nor let me have to seek youâI shall be At home entirely, till I've cook'd a plot, Against the pandar, master of my love. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. Enter SATURIO, the Parasiteâ Sat. The old and ancient trade of parasites, I practice, study, and pursue with careâ Nor ever had I any ancestor, But stuff'd his paunch, by fawning for a dinner. My father, grandfather, great grandfather, His father, grandfather, great grandfather, Like mice they liv'd on victuals not their own, And never were in gluttony exceededâ From hence it was we got the name of hard-heads. Their trade I follow, and fill up the place, The station of my ancestorsâBesides, I would not turn informerâAnd I think There is no credit in it, to obtain Another's goods, and run no risk one's selfâ Nor am I pleas'd with those who doâI speak My mindâAnd he, who for the publick good Informs, and not for private ends, I could Persuade myself is a good man and true. He who convicts a breaker of the laws, Let him pay half his gains unto the publick. Moreover, be't enacted in my law, Whene'er to gain a fourth a man informs, Let him be bound to pay to the accused So much, if he should fail in proof, that both May go before the judge on equal terms. Was this a law in force we should not see The white net spread to take our neighbour's goods. But am I not a fool to regulate The commonwealth?âWhen there are magistrates Whose proper duty 'tisâWellâNow I'll in, And visit the remains of last night's supperâ See if they've rested well or notâAnd whether They have been fev'rish, or cover'd closeâ That no one may have snap'd a bitâBut see! The doors are opening; I must stay my progress. SCENE III. Enter TOXILUS. Tox. Yes, I have hit upon the very thing, How I may make the pandar buy to day, With his own cash, his own slave's libertyâ But see the parasite, whose help I wantâ I'll make pretence as if I did not see him, So draw him onâMind you those thingsâBe briskâ [to the slaves within.] Lest ought be unprepar'd when I return, Mix the sweet wineâGet myrrh and quinces readyâ Let them be warm'd together o'er the fireâ Throw in besides the aromatick reedâ For I expect my pot companion here.â Sat. [apart.] O brave!âWell saidâI am the man he meansâ Tox. For he'll return from bathing presently. Sat. [apart.] What care he takes to have all things in order! Tox. See that the buns and biscuits be well done, Serve them not up undress'dâ Sat. [apart.] He speaks the thing! They're good for nought unless you eat them dress'd. Nor are the sauces good, but when the spoon Will stand an endâI hate your thin, clear slops Tinctur'd with saffronâI like my sauce thick, Stiff as a jellyâThat which I should eat, I would not drinkâ Tox. Some one is talking here, I know not whoâ Sat. O my terrestrial Jove! Your guest salutes youâ Tox. You have nick'd the time, Saturioâ Sat. Now by Pollux! that's a fib And misbecomes you mightilyâfor 'troth I come Hungurio, not Saturio hitherâ Tox. But you shall eatâThe dainties smoak withinâ I've order'd last night's remnants to be warm'dâ Sat. A ham is better cold the second dayâ Tox. So have I order'd it to be serv'd up. Sat. Hast any ketchup? Tox. Psha! Psha!âAsk you that? Sat. Nay, you're a man of taste. Tox. Don't you remember The thing I mention'd yesterdayâ Sat. Quite wellâ The conger eel should not be warm'd again, Nor lampreyâboth are eaten better cold. Why do we loiter?âLet's begin the attackâ The morning is the time all men should eatâ Tox. 'Tis sure too early in the dayâ Sat. In general What in the morning you begin, employs The dayâ Tox. I beg your serious attention. But yesterday, I had some talk with youâ And earnestly begg'd of you, that you'd lend me Six hundred pieces, which I had a use for. Sat. I well remember itâAnd know you ask'd, And that I had not wherewithal to lend itâ What sort of parasite is he, I pray, Who has his money in his chest at home? Had he wherewith at home to make a feast, He'd cram and stuff his guts immediately. A Parasite in truth should be a Cynic. A jug, a strigil, drinking cup, and socks, A cloak and purse, with just enough to serve In cases of necessity, is all He ought to have.â Tox, I now don't want your moneyâ Let me, instead of money, have your daughterâ Sat. By Pollux' temple! I don't let my daughterâ Tox. I mean not for the purpose you insinuateâ Sat. Why, what is't then you want her forâ Tox. I'll tell you. She's a genteel smart figureâ Sat. Yes, she is soâ Tox. This pandar knows you not, nor yet your daughterâ Sat. There's none know me, but those who entertain me. Tox. That's trueâBy this means, you may raise me cash. Sat. I wish I couldâ Tox. Then let me sell your daughter. Sat. You sell her?â Tox. No, not IâI will depute Some other in my stead, who shall pretend To be a foreigner, and he shall sell herâ 'Tis not six months ago, that he, the pandar, Remov'd from Megarisâ Sat. The cookery spoilsâ This may be done another timeâ Tox. But how? You shall not eat a morselâNay depend on't, Till you engage to do the thing I ask. As soon as possible, unless you bring Your daughter here, by Herc'les, I'll cashier you. What now!âWhy don't you tell me what you'll do? Sat. 'Troth if you have a mind to't, sell me too, So you'll but sell me with my stomach full. Tox. If you will do it, do itâ Sat. I will do Just what you pleaseâ Tox. That's kindâMake hasteâHie homeâ Tutor your daughter cunningly; and give her Her cue with artâHow she may frame her storyâ Where she may say she had her birthâWho were Her parents, and the place whence she was stolenâ Let her suppose, tho', it was far from Athensâ Where she was bornâAnd all the while she tells Her story, let her feign a flood of tearsâ Sat. What! han't you said enough?âShe's three times worse Than even you could wish her. Tox. That's well saidâ But do you know what 'tis I'd have you do? You must provide a tunick and a girdle, And bring a broad brim'd hat, and soldier's cloak To dress him in, who is to sell your daughter. Sat. Excellent this! Tox. As if he was a foreigner. Sat. I praise your schemeâ Tox. Do you then bring your daughter, Quaintly dress'd out, and in some foreign fashion. Sat. But whence intend you to procure the habit? Tox. Why, from the master of the wardrobeâ'Tis His business to accommodate the actorsâ The Ãdiles for that purpose plac'd him there. Sat. Well, I'll take care to bring them here immediately, But I am to know nothing of the matter. Tox. No, not a syllableâAs soon as e'er I have receiv'd the money she is sold for, You will directly claim her of the pandarâ Sat. If I don't bear her off immediately, Why let him keep herâ Tox. Go, and mind your businessâ [Exit Saturio. Meanwhile, I'll to my love dispatch the boyâ Bid her take heartâAnd tell her I shall finish Th'affair to dayâI prattle here too long.â [Exit. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter SOPHOCLIDISCA and LEMNISELENE. SOPHOCLIDISCA. An untaught, thoughtless, silly girl needs not So often to be told.âI see you think I am a country girl, a downright simpletonâ Tho' I drink wine, I drink not your commandsâ Me, and my manners, I conceiv'd, by this You'd tried enoughâI've now attended you Five years almostâSend but a dog to school As long, he'll know his letters well.âBut you, Speaking or not, not all this while have learn'd My dispositionâCan't you say no more? And leave off stunning me?âI recollect, Remember, know, and understand you are Unhappily in loveâLove in your mind Bubbles and boilsâBut I'll allay the ferment. Lemn.

Heaven grant, this thing may turn out well to me, To you, my appetite, and also to A perpetuity of feasts!âO may There be enough, a superfluity, and may They e'en outlast me!âWith the gods good leave, Follow me, daughterâYou perceive, you know, You comprehend the thing we are to doâ All my designs I have imparted to you; And for that purpose I have dress'd you thus, You must be sold to dayâ Daug. I beg, my father, At others cost how much so e'er you wish To eat, you'd not, to gratify your appetite, Now sell your daughter. Sat. 'Twould be strange, that I, For Attalus, or for king Philip's sake, Should rather sell thee, girl, than for my own. Why, are you not my own? Daug. Do you, my father, Look on me as your daughter, or your slave? Sat. That which is most convenient for my appetiteâ I am your lord and master, not you mineâ Daug. Father, I own it, it is true you areâ But since our pittance is but small, we ought To lead a frugal, and a modest life. For, if to poverty we add disgrace, Our poverty will be of double weight; Our credit, of no weight at all. Sat. Be goneâ You are impertinentâ Daug. I hope I'm not, Nor do I think I am; when, though so young, I give my father good adviceâOur foes Misrepresent thingsâ Sat. Let them, as they please; And then go hang themselvesâfor their reports Won't hurt me half so much, nor do I think them One half so bad, as an uncover'd table. Daug. Disgrace and scandal are immortal, sir; And live, when one would think them dead and gone. Sat. What! are you then afraid lest I should sell you? Daug. My fatherâno I'm not afraid you will. But I could wish you would not feign to sell meâ Sat. That wish is vain; for I must have my will. It shall be soâWhat now! Daug. Reflect on thisâ Whene'er a master menaces a slave; Although he don't intend to put his threats In execution, whilst the whip's in hand, While he undresses, what's the misery, What is the pain, he does not undergo! So I the thing, which may not happen, fear. Sat. There never was a girl, nor yet a woman, Who thought herself much wiser than her parents, But she was good for nothingâ Daug. Let me say, There never was a girl, nor yet a woman, That e'er was good, who held her peace, while things Were going wrong before her face. Sat. You'd better Beware of mischiefâ Daug. If I can't avoid it, What should I do? You'd best beware yourself. Sat. Am I a mischief? Daug. No: And if you were It would not become me to say you wereâ But I would do my best to hinder others From saying it, who have licentious tongues. Sat. Let every man say what he will, I will not Be driven from this purposeâ Daug. Sir, if I Might have my way, you rather should act wisely Than act imprudentlyâ Sat. It is my pleasureâ Daug. Your pleasure I esteem a lawâBut if I had my will, it should not be your pleasure. Sat. Will you, or will you not obey your father? Daug. I'm all obedience.â Sat. Know you my instructions? Daug. I know them allâ Sat. And this among the restâ How you was stolen? Daug. Perfectly wellâ Sat. And who Your parents were? Daug. I bear it all in mind.

You don't observe the manners of the timesâ Girls, of whatever character, get husbands, Easily hereâAnd so they have but money, All faults are overlook'dâ Daug. Remember though That I'm without a fortuneâ Sat. Say not soâ Through the assistance of the gods, and from My ancestors, I swear I have a fortune For you.âSay not then you are dowerless, Who have at home a fortuneâI have got A choice collection of most curious booksâ And if you manage this affair adroitly, Your fortune is, six hundred witty sayings, All AtticâNot a Syracusian word Among themâWith a fortune such as this, Why you may marry even with a beggarâ Daug. If I'm to go, sir, lead me where you willâ Or sell me, or do with me what you please. Sat. You now say what is just and equitableâ Follow me this wayâ Daug. I obey you, sirâ [Exeunt.

Truce with your tongue, I begâyour voice is strong, And must prevailâ Dor.

So now I'm calm againâIt put me in a rage That you refus'd to trust me with the money. Dor.

Take thisâ Dor. Why don't you give it? Tox. Here are six hundred pieces, ready toldâ Now give my girl her freedomâBring her here, Immediatelyâ Dor. I'll bring her in a twinklingâ By Hercules! I know not whom to trust, To try this moneyâ Tox. What, are you afraid, Not to find any hand to trust it in? Dor. It would be strange indeed, should not the bankers Scamper away, and fly off from the forum, Swift as the chariot wheel whirls round the circusâ Tox. Thro' th'alley go, the back way to the forum; And thro' the garden let her come to me, The same back-wayâ Dor. I'll see, she shall be hereâ Tox. But not in publickâ Dor.

And this The kidnapp'd girl? Tox. I know no more than you, But that I've seen herâBe she who she will, She's quite genteelâ Dor. Her face is well enough. Tox. [aside] With what contempt the scoundrel speaks of herâ In silence then we will observe her form. [to Dord.] Dor. Well, be it so, I like your counsel well. SCENE IV. Enter SAGARISTIO and the DAUGHTER of SATURIO. Sag. Don't Athens seem a rich and sumptuous city? Daug. I've only seen the outside and the form; The ways and manners of the people, yet But little I've observ'd.â Tox. There's not a word, But from the very first she has wisely spoke. Dor. [apart] In a first word I cannot find out wisdom. Sag. But as to what you've seenâHow does the city Seem fortified?â Daug. Why I should think indeed, Be but the manners of the people good, The city's well and fairly fortifiedâ If breach of faith be banish'd from the city; Embezzlement of publick money too, And avarice; if three others with them, spite, Ambition, scandal; perjury a seventhâ Tox. O brave! Dor. If idleness an eighth, a ninth Injurious treatment; and a tenth, of all Most difficult to come at, lawless lust; If all this crew be not remov'd from hence, The thickest wall is a defence too weakâ Tox. What say you, Dordalus?â Dor. What is't you mean? Tox. You're of the ten, one of the brotherhoodâ You ought to troop off hence to banishmentâ Dor. How so? Tox. Because you are a perjur'd rascalâ Dor. Ay, by my troth, there's wisdom in those wordsâ Tox. Buy her I sayâThis turns to your advantage. Dor. Why, troth, the more I look, the more I like herâ Tox. If you should purchase her, immortal gods! You'll be the richest merchant in the place, Turn people out of their estates and houses, Be introduc'd to men of rank and quality. They'll pay you court, and feast and revel with you. Dor. I'll not admit them tho'â Tox. Then, they by night Will sing abusive songs before your house; Burn down your doorsâThen you may shut your house With doors of steel, make your whole house of iron, Fix iron thresholds, iron bolt and ring;â For fear, if you be sparing of your iron, You should get iron fetters for yourself. Dor. Go, hang yourselfâ Tox. Go you, and buy the girlâ Mind what I've saidâ Dor. Let me but know the priceâ Tox. Say, shall I call him hitherâ Dor. I'll go to him. Tox. What say you, friend?â[to Sagaristio.] Sag. I'm come, and bring the girl, As I just now had promis'd you I wouldâ 'Twas but last night, our ship arriv'd in portâ I wish to sell this maiden, if I can; If not, why then with all the speed I may I'll go from henceâ Dor. Welcome, young manâ Sag. Well come Indeed, can I but sell her at her price. Tox. You'll sell her well to him, or else to no oneâ Sag. Are you his friend?â Tox. As much as all the gods, Heaven's high inhabitantsâ Dor. 'Tis past a doubt You're then my foeâFor never was a god To any of our trade so kind, that he Would favour himâ Sag. Come to the point in handâ Have you a mind to buy my girl?â Dor. Why yesâ If you've a mind to sell, I have to buyâ If you've no business on your hands in haste, I'm quite at leisure tooâ Sag. Well, fix your priceâ Dor. The goods are yoursâThat's what you ought to do. Tox. That's fairâ Sag. Would you buy cheap? Dor. Would you sell dear? Tox. That's what both wish I know, by Hercules! Dor. Come, set your priceâ Sag. I must inform you first, No man alive will warrant you the goods: You understand me? Dor. Yes I do, declare The lowest price, that one may have her forâ Tox. Peace, peace you fool, you're acting like a childâ Dor. How so? Tox. Because, I first would have you ask Some proper questions of the girl herself. Dor. By Hercules! you give no bad adviceâ The wary pandar I had almost slipt, And fal'n into a trap, if you had not Been hereâOf what advantage 'tis to have A friend at hand, when business is transacted! Tox. Inquire her family, where she was born, And who her parents are; lest you should say That you had made by my advice and impulse Too rash a bargainâBy your leave, my friend [to Sagaristio. Would a few questions ask of this fair maidâ Sag. With all my heart, at his own will and pleasure. Tox. Why stand you?âGo yourself, make your demandsâ Altho' the liberty was granted me, Yet you may ask such questions as you pleaseâ And I had rather you should go yourself, For fear the man should hold you in contempt. Dor. You give me good advice enoughâMy friend, [to Sagaristio. I fain would ask this girl of yours some questions. Sag. From first to last, as many as you pleaseâ Tox. Bid her come here to meâ Sag. Go to him, child, And do what he commandsâExamine herâ[to Dord. Ask her as many questions as you please. Tox. [to Dordalus]. Come on now youâstep forward; and take care You enter on the matter with good omens. Dor. The auspices are clearâ Tox. Then hold your tongue. Go back a little; now I'll bring her to you. [goes to the girl. Dor. Do what you think is most for my advantageâ Tox. [to the girl.] Follow meâ[to Dord.] Would you ask her any question? I lead her to youâ[going. Dor. I'd fain have you byâ Tox. I can'tâI must obey my master's will, And do my duty to this stranger here.â [pointing to Sagaristio. Suppose he should not like to have me by?â Sag. [to Toxilus] Yes, yes, come nearâ Tox. I will assist you thenâ Dor. When you assist your friend, you aid yourselfâ Tox. Examine herâ[Aside to the girl] Be you upon your guardâ Daug. A word's enough [aside to Toxilus.] Altho' I am a slave [aloud. I know my duty wellâTo his demands I must a fair and candid answer make As far as I'm inform'dâ Tox. My girl, this man's An honest manâ Daug. I do believe he isâ Tox. You will not serve him longâ Daug. Such is my hope, If that my parents will but do their dutyâ Dor. Be not surpriz'd I beg, if we demand Who are your parents, and what is your country? Daug. Why should I be surpriz'd at that, good sir? My state of slavery has forbid me now To be amaz'd at any evil hap Which may betide poor meâ Tox. Weep notâ Daug. Alass! Alass! ah! woe is meâ Tox. [aside] The gods confound her! Why, what an artful, crafty slut she is!â She has courage too, and says just what she ought. Dor. Pray give me leave to ask your nameâ Tox. Ah! now I'm in a mortal fright, lest she should blunder.â Daug. In my own country, I was called Lucrisâ Tox. The name and omen are worth any priceâ Why don't you purchase her?â[aside] She has pass'd the pikes, I was most wofully afraid she'd blunderâ Dor. If I should purchase you, I'm confident, My lucre you will beâ Tox. And if you do, 'Tis my belief, she will not be your slave To the month's endâ Dor. Why, that's my wish, by Hercules! Tox. Assist yourself, that you may have your wish. She has made no faux-pas yet.[aside. Dor. Where was you born? Daug. 'Troth, as my mother told me, in the kitchenâ And in a nook on the left hand of itâ Tox. To you, she'll be a lucky courtezanâ The place of her nativity was warm, And where good things of every kind aboundâ The rogue was taken in, when he enquir'd [aside. Where she was bornâShe plays him off most rarelyâ Dor. But what's your country?âthat's the thing I ask? Daug. What should it be, but this where now I amâ Dor. But I enquire for that which was your countryâ Daug. What was, is deem'd as nothing when 'tis goneâ You might as well ask one who has breath'd his last, Who once he wasâ Tox. So may the gods be kind! How cleverly she answersâYet I pity herâ Dor. But still, my girl, what country are you of? Speak out at onceâWhat does this silence mean? Daug. I'll truly tell you then, what is my countryâ This is my country, for I'm here a slave, Tox. Touch not that stringâYou see, she'll not speak out, Lest you recall past miseries to her mindâ Dor. Well, wellâIs then your father in captivity? Daug. No, he is notâBut every thing he had He lostâ Tox. She must be of a noble house; Her only knowledge is, to speak the truthâ Dor. Who was your father?âLet me know his name? Daug. Why should I say, who was my wretched fatherâ Both of us now may well be called wretchedâ Dor. And how was he esteem'd among the people? Daug. None better lik'dâBoth slaves and free men lov'd him. Tox. You have describ'd a man of woe indeedâ Who has lost his friends, and is undone himself. Dor. I think I'll purchase herâ Tox. Still, only think so? Dor. She is descended from a princely race, I well believeâ Tox. You'll make a fortune by herâ Dor. Gods grant I may! Tox. Would you but close the bargain. Daug. This I must sayâSoon as my father knows I'm here arriv'd he'll come and ransom me. Tox. How now?â Dor. What is'tâ Tox. Heard you not what she said? Daug. Altho' his fortune's bankrupt, he has friends [weeps. Dor. Weep notâYou'll soon regain your liberty, If you've gallants enoughâBut are you willing To be my slave? Daug. Upon condition, that I am not so too longâ Tox. Mark how she harps Upon her freedomâShe will be a mass, A mint of money to youâCome, do this If you do any thingâI'll go to himâ [meaning Sagaristio.] Follow you meâ[to the girl] I'll bring her back to you.â [to Sagaristio. Dor. Young man, are you dispos'd to sell this girl? Sag. I rather chuse to sell her, than to lose herâ Dor. Declare then in a word what I must give, And fix your priceâ Sag. And I will fix it so, That I shall shew, I wish to deal with you. Then for a hundred minÃ¦ she is yoursâ Dor. That is too muchâ Sag. For eighty thenâ Dor. Too muchâ Sag. I cannot bate a single piece of what I mention nowâ Dor. Well, what is that?âSpeak outâ Sag. Then she is yours for sixty silver minÃ¦, At your own riskâ Dor. Say then, what shall I do? [apart to Toxilus. Tox. May the angry gods pursue you for a villain! [apart to Dordalus. Boggle at such a purchase!â Dor. Well, I'll have her Tox. You've got a noble prizeâGo fetch the moneyâ She'd be a bargain at three hundred minÃ¦â You are the winner.â Sag. Hark you me! I add Ten minÃ¦ more for her habilimentsâ Dor. You should abate, not addâ Tox. Can't you be quietâ You see he wants a handle to be offâ Why don't you go, and fetch the money? Dor. Mind, And watchâ Tox. Go inâ Dor. I'm goneâI'll bring the money. [Exit. SCENE V. Tox. You've help'd us admirably well, my girl, And play'd your part with judgment, sense, and skill. Daug. When on good men a favour we confer, 'Twill seem important, and will always please them. Tox. Hark you!âYou Persian, when you have the money, Pretend you're going to the ship directlyâ Sag. Instruct not me.â Tox. And then return again, By the back lane on that side, through the garden. Sag. You well describe the way that shall be be takenâ Tox.

And what do they profess? Dor. To buy this bagâOr cause it to return To me againâ Sag. Ay, that's lest you should be A pandar incompleat, you sordid wretch, You fear to lose your bagâ Tox. Let him alone; I beg you doâFor, since he is a pandar The thing's not wonderful at allâ Dor. This day, If heed is given to omens I shall make Considerable profitâNothing then So small, but I should grieve to part with itâ Here, take itâ Sag. Hang it then about my neck, If 'tis not troublesomeâ Dor. It shall be doneâ [Hangs the bag about Sagaristio's neck. Sag. Is there ought else you would command me in? Dor. Why in such haste? Sag.

You've put it luckily into my head,â I think I've seen one here exactly like you, Just the same sizeâ Sag. 'Tis certainly my brother. Dor. But we would gladly know your name? Tox. His name?

NoâFarewellâ Sag. Farewell to youâMy mind's on board alreadyâ Dor. You'd better go to-morrowâSup with us To-dayâ[to Sagaristio going.] Well, if it must be soâFarewell. [Exit Sagaristio. SCENE VII. Tox. So! now he's gone, I may declare my mind. This day has shone a lucky day indeedâ You have not bought her, for she's all clear gain. Dor. Ah! he knows well enough what he has done. He has sold stol'n goods, and sold them at my risk. How do I know she may'nt be claim'd to-day?â Where shall I follow him?âTo PersiaâNonsense!â Tox. I thought you would have thank'd me for the favourâ Dor. I do return you thanks indeed, my Toxilusâ For I perceive you aided me with careâ Tox. Aided, d'you say?âI serv'd you to some purpose.
