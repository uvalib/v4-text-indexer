      <field name="fulltext">ACT I SCENE I Scene: Room in the English Castle of Count Geoffrey. Ursyne, a girl of twenty, very delicate in expression and countenance, but with no suggestion of morbidity, is standing on a kind of raised stool, looking out of the window. The room is lit by two torches. One is placed in the corner away from Ursyne; the other at back of stage near Osbern, who is working at a table with his back to the audience. At the opposite end of the room, which can be divided by a long curtain, a group of girls are sitting togetherâArlette, Muriel, Jacqueline and Blanche. Cecily sits apart with an instrument, and is apparently resting as the curtain goes up. URSYNE. [To herself.] Setting sun and joy of life all quenched, Trembling sea, and trees tall in the dusk. The north wind drives the fallen leaves, They dance and reel, And seem to feel Spring thrilling with her soft reprieves From winter's blight. Birds in their nests lie warm; But black rooks take their flight. Wild restless ones! Why will ye fight with sleep? For nightânight comes. [Ursyne sighs deeply and continues looking out of the window. CECILY. [Singing.] âAdieu,â said he. Adieu she could not say. âFarewell,â said he. âFarewell, this is a day That we must long remember, you and I.â âHe's gone,â said they. âCome forth, clouds fill the sky, The rain will fall ere you have felt the sun.â âShines the sun still? I thought rain had begun.â [Ursyne comes down from window, drags curtain across, separating herself from the rest of the girls. URSYNE. Here it is cold. [She goes back to the window. BLANCHE. How desolate she seems! No song of love has ever reached her ears, For who that loves doth ever sigh for death? ARLETTE. Hush! Hush! BLANCHE. Why hush? ARLETTE. She never talks of love. MURIEL. How oft, then, must she think of it! BLANCHE. Oh, hush! ARLETTE. New damoiselle from France, you should be courtly. [Arlette goes out. CECILY. She could not hear. We hate her. She's a witch. JACQUELINE. [Mysteriously.] Secrets have I, Not from the sky! Ursyne could tell Better than well, Why she is sad While we are glad, Why it is cold In towers old, When maidens sing Of anything Which brings to mind Lovers unkind! BLANCHE. Jacqueline! JACQUELINE. Earl Hugh came here from Normandy Two years ago. He sailed to see Whether the praise he heard was verity, Concerning Arlette of Belesmes, Lovely of face and sweet in fame, Not yet sixteen.âWhat piteous blame! BLANCHE. Jacqueline! JACQUELINE. Betrothed were they, but, since her years Were still so new, the Earl had fears Marriage would bring but showers of tears. He thought this more when he saw there Her cousin Ursyne's raven hair, And eyes that drew him with flames more fair Than Elfin light on marshes deep. Whene'er he looked, she seemed to weep. Little by little, false love did creep Into his heart. Betrothed was he To Arlette, yet, O, misery! Ursyne did hold him in captivity. MURIEL. Arlette, methinks, can have no pride, Despised so soonânot yet a bride. Ships borne to sea by an unwilling tide Are often wrecked! JACQUELINE. She never knew. But when the silver trumpets blew For Holy War 'gainst sinful Turk and Jew, Scarce were her tears at his desire To win a martyr's crown, or fire All infidel mosques. He rode away: His cross was red: the morning grey Was glittering as some moonlit bay Of waters dark, for his bright spear And helmet shone like crystal clear. âOne kiss,â he cried, âthen pray for me, my dear!â BLANCHE. Jacqueline! JACQUELINE. Earl Hugh was slain: Arlette is free: Ursyne in woe must ever be, Dreading the doom of her iniquity. BLANCHE. Jacqueline! CECILY. [Peeping through curtain at Ursyne and pointing to Osbern.] The witch is still, But, by her will, She calls the spell Of madness from Hell, For Osbern, the knave, Handsome and brave, Ignoble in birth, Cursed on the earth, His father's sin to bear, His mother's shame to wear! MURIEL. Who is this Osbern? BLANCHE. 'Tis Carliol's cousin. MURIEL. The great Earl's cousin? Is't by virtue of blood? JACQUELINE. Nay, rather by his mother's lack of virtue! BLANCHE. For shame! for shame! Count Geoffrey much regards him. He's something lunatic and would be a poet. Meanwhile he casts long sums and writes in Latin Old stuff that's counted precious. JACQUELINE. I would not read it. MURIEL. And I had rather sleep and eat and dance Than hear a nightingale any day o'the week! Come, come. Let's to the court and laugh awhile. [They all go out. Osbern, who has been seated at the back of the stage, now comes forward. He rubs his eyes and draws back the long curtain and looks at Ursyne for some moments before he speaks. He is a young man, about twenty-six, vigorous in appearance, but with an ascetic countenance. OSBERN. What do you think of while you sit alone? URSYNE. I think of summers that are past and stars That fall. OSBERN. But, if they fall from heaven to earth, The earth is very fair, Ursyne! URSYNE. Alas! I do not see it so. OSBERN. Then through your eyes, I'll watch a wretchedness so set in beauty. URSYNE. Is stark damnation sadder than the world Which, compassed about with happiness, still feels No touch of it? For what is good, I find not. OSBERN. [Going up to her and looking into her eyes. O, more mysterious than an autumn night, Grave as a wintry sea with all its storms Enchanted and entranced! Let me sink deep And drown myself! URSYNE. You have your cousin's voiceâ Your cousin's very voice. OSBERN. But he is dead. We liveâwe live, Ursyne, and this is life. URSYNE. Once he said that. OSBERN. And he said all things well! But, as thou sayest I have his voice to speak with, Give me the kiss that taught his lips their utterance, Then you shall hear what desperate men dare do When they are cursed in loving, and all the war They make is on their mutinous hearts. God knows! URSYNE. God sees that I am tremblingâyet, I listen. OSBERN. Stars that are brightest tremble most, sweet lady! In overwhelming loveâin jealousy's grief, Vainly I sought to say what I say now. Be but a little patient! I have had patience While sore incurable hopes grew on my soul. Teach me your sorceries that I may know When seven devils come to me. Their malice Could not be half so subtle as this hair Which, like a serpent, winds around my being, Till I could faint in ecstasies of love Orâdeath. I know not which, I am become, So strange from desperation. URSYNE. I fear your mind. 'Tis treacherous, bound to the Furies, all Uncertain. OSBERN. Was I not born without the law? URSYNE. Why dost thou always harp upon these wrongs? Hate will undo you: there shall be madness next. [With terror.] At night I hear the crackling laugh of fools, Yet my room's empty but for owls and bats. OSBERN. O, how this acid passion of grief doth waste Thy conscience! One would think there were more causesâ Nay, I'll not think it. [Aside.] Sin would be more silent, Would show a smoother resignation. Sin Would fold its disannulling hands, and speak Gaping beatitudes about God's willâ But this once answer meâdid he, at any time, Threaten or breathe that thou wast greatly loved? URSYNE. He came for Arlette. Laughing, I peeped to see My little cousin's bridegroom: he looked also. OSBERN. That glance became intangled, past unravelling. ... URSYNE. Arlette played melodies; I stole away Into the outer court and watched our men, Who, barely strong enough to lift his armour, Were cleansing it from dust. In mirth I breathed Upon the heavy plate that shields his breast, And, with my sleeve, did make it bright as glass, Where, bending low, I could discern no Arlette, But my own face affrighted at its joy. OSBERN. O, woman's loving is more soft than ours, And gains such rapture from some foolish omen As we, in all our might, cannot extract From Nature's best reality. URSYNE. No more We looked, and, after that, I laughed no more. We met and passed and passed and met each day. Each evening, from the hall where others danced, I crept away; nor did I think of love, Nor anything disloyal to Arlette. But it was sad to sleep whilst others danced. OSBERN. And did you sleep? URSYNE. Yes; for in sleep I lost The dreams life gave. ... Then, after twenty days, He rode away and I was left continuing. ... That morn we spoke. What words he said, I heard not, But, now he's dead, I do remember them, And they come back like distant music played Behind great gates of bronze and adamant. OSBERN. And is this all? URSYNE. Could there be more than this? He was betrothed to Arlette. OSBERN. [Ironically.] I had forgotten! [A knocking is heard. URSYNE. My father has come. OSBERN. Hath he found the lovers? URSYNE. [Smiling.] Lovers! Thou art handsome but thou art crazed! OSBERN. [Mocking.] Ursyne sees the dead; she is blind to the living! URSYNE. What have I missed, wise Osbern? OSBERN. The game of Fate, swifter than God! [With a hidden sneer.] I can tell you the tale of a maid who is not weeping like a widow. She does not sit a poor languishing bird, without mate or answering voice. Her love is not for the absent. URSYNE. What would you say? OSBERN. I say that Arlette hath found a husband âEadric the Saxon. They meet in the twilight by the lake, and in the orchard, and in the copse. There are pretty meetings. The man hath honour: on his side it is worship, and on hers it is innocence. But if there is much honesty, there is more love. URSYNE. [Slowly.] How soon she hath learnt forgetting! Carliol now is surely mine, for I am found faithful. OSBERN. [Mocking.] You touch derision's bell! Hast no interest in thy yearning cousin? Shall she marry a Saxon? I speak of Arlette, I hint at perilâthe peril of marriage; straightway you thank God for her fickleness, saying, Carliol is the more mine. I, only I, am faithful. Blessings on Arletteâblessings on her new love. Who is he? Yet no matter; I am found faithful! Girl! girl! thou shalt surely die of this. I read it! I read it! URSYNE. I would read gladly in that book. OSBERN. Wouldst thou then yield thy fragrant youth to death? Sink this soft image of white perfectness In those dark dregs where roots and creeping things Seethe in the primal heat ere they become Matter that's fit for th'sight. Art thou declined To that foul kettle? And why? Is it for God? His greater glory? Nay, 'tis a spleenâa rage, A sick discouragement, that comes from loving Some pretty, strutting, eloquent, hardened dust You took to be a man. I see too well. URSYNE. He who seeks love must have himself the quality To comprehend its essence. Thou art far From that deep knowledge. [Ursyne goes out. OSBERN. O, not so far, Ursyne. [He throws up his arms in despair, then casts himself down at the table, burying his face in his hands. Enter the Abbot. ABBOT. My son, thou art cast down. For three things do young men sufferâthe vain love of this world, the excessive love of self, or the inordinate love of some creature! OSBERN. I do confess my great affection. I deny it not, just as I do not deny that I am a man. I can feel pain, and that in spite of myself. I can love a woman. You may call this carnal. I say that it is human. ABBOT. Let thy affliction instruct thee, not destroy thee. All things fall short of being perfect; none are safe; many are beyond thy prayer. OSBERN. True. Yet I have blood in my veins, and where the knife pierces I must bleed; and if I am stricken I must grieve. ABBOT. Take upon your brow and your shoulders the mark of salvation; march, in arms, under the standard of the living God. Give your life to the service of your brothers, and so find peace. OSBERN. Aye, in peace is my bitterness most bitter! ABBOT. Join this holy pilgrimage, and a hard road under thy feet will ease thy troubled spirit. OSBERN. Ask me againânot now, not now. ABBOT. The pilgrims go at daybreak. OSBERN. Not now! ABBOT. Such wilfulness, my son, is sin. OSBERN. So be it, then. My will is all I have; when I renounce that I give up everything, and I am not yet ready for that sacrifice. I can fast; I can spend whole nights upon my knees. I can let chains fret into my flesh; I fear neither cold, nor heat, nor scourgings, nor austerities. But my will is my will. ABBOT. The pilgrims go at daybreak! OSBERN. My father, I shall rise earlier than they to watch their setting forth! ... [The Abbot lifts up his hands, shakes his head, and goes out. OSBERN. O God! I give Thee allâexcept my will! END OF SCENE I. SCENE II Scene: A copse. Eadric waits by the path, and through the trees Arlette is seen approaching. She walks slowly and reaches him in silence. EADRIC. The wood is white with your paleness, sweet Arlette. ARLETTE. Accusing cares flock round my joy this day. I dared not think or speak the name of Eadric. Love that is secret hath remorse for friend. EADRIC. My sweet Arlette, from sunny France you came To these bleak hills, black woods, and skies forlorn. My rose, more beautiful than the shining sun, If you should go away, how should I live? ARLETTE. I could not leave thee though they bore me hence, And, under fathoms of ground, laid me to sleep. My home is in thine heart and there I'll rest, As some small seagull nestling on the sea, Floats o'er the agitations of each tide With confident peace. EADRIC. O, my sole joy on earth, Flower too silken, too delicate and white For my rough hold, how I do worship thee! Yet, I'll not call thee angel lest thou change By that rash word into the phantom beauty I may adore but never quite possess. In wrath I lived here, heartsick, sorrowing, Thrall to one constant thought which was a hate Against thy race. My murdered kinsmen stood With dreadful wounds entreating swift revenge For injuries dire. ARLETTE. Beloved, say no more. You look so sternly toward me, I could weep. EADRIC. Dear love, I feel ashamed at thy pure face. It is a milky pearl set in the air To make my blackness seem the more corrupt. Yet, when I turn aside, my eyelids ache, And I would seek once more humiliation Given with a recompense that's infinite! [Kneels at her feet. ARLETTE. [Looking away from him.] Around the pallid south, stars pierce the twilight. Dear, I must go. But yesâUrsyne is waiting. I trust her well. She is an intercessor Who hath compassion for fidelity. She once did love a great lord who is dead. She does not speak of him: his name I know not. Often I sit close by her while she thinks. Companions in our silence, we have watched The blaze of many fires and heard the logs Sing their shrill song while the hot flames consumed them. âAh,â said she once, âa woman would die thus!â EADRIC. I doubt a sorrow when it mutters words Too wise. Witches do that. ARLETTE. She is no witch! Swiftly I'll go and beg her influence. Get you to prayer, then wait upon my uncle EADRIC. But he shall hear defiance, not entreaties. ARLETTE. Thou art a Saxonâfreeâthe son of kings, And when thou call'st, I follow, not rebellious, But conquered by the pride of my own choice. Be sure that Norman love is as thine own ... EADRIC. Eternal! [They embrace; she leaves him. He watches her till she is out of sight, then follows at a distance. END OF SCENE II. SCENE III Scene: The same as Scene I. Ursyne enters bearing a torch, followed by Count Geoffrey. URSYNE. Why are you late? Colder now grows this room. [She goes back to her place by the window. Count Geoffrey watches her from where he stands by the fire. The wind, more dismal still, howls the lament Of everlasting love, bound in the air, To feel both fire and frost and chilly rain, But never the sweet flowering of the Spring. My element is earth, yet I could sob With thee! O, dark, cold nightâif I had wings! COUNT GEOFFREY. The night is quiet and I hear no wind. URSYNE. Then it must be presentiment of woe That gnaws my heart whilst I sit watching here. Watchingâfor whom? Waitingâfor whom? COUNT GEOFFREY. I bring Strange news that will interpret well these portents. [She comes down the stage. Turn thy white face toward me. It is sad. How old art thou? URSYNE. Twenty, and that's too long. COUNT GEOFFREY. Dost thou hate all men? URSYNE. All living men save thee. COUNT GEOFFREY. Many brave knights have begged thy hand, Ursyne. Though thou art poor, thy beauty looks more rare Than all the land and dower of Arlette. URSYNE. Let Arlette be. COUNT GEOFFREY. No envy need afflict Thy girlhood's pride because of this rich cousin. Arlette may buy a husband, while for thee There's the devotion that a man achieves When he's competitor and not the prize. URSYNE. My mind is not for marriage. Oft I think That my wild heart is with some damned soul Already suffering all the pangs of hell. My body's here, my spirit's far away, Driven and tossed, and tortured on a rack, Which does not rend the less because it is Invisible! O God! COUNT GEOFFREY. Go and confess. Thy solitude is shared by whispering fiends. Thou art too much alone. Acts of contrition Will drive away these mad and gloomy thoughts. Come, be not sullen. What? She loves no man? She has no curiosityâperverse! I have great news. Wilt thou not beg for them? URSYNE. All tidings come full soon. Is England lost? Is Normandy become a wilderness? Has the day's sport been somewhat better or worse Than the day's sport this day, this month, last year? COUNT GEOFFREY. Now wide astonishment, larger than any hope, Will catch these roving eyes, and light these cheeks. My news affects thy cousin more than thee, And her young soul, more womanish and frail Than thine, may grow distraught from th'violence Of unexpected joy. Tranquillity Broods o'er thy nature and to thee emotion Is but a lake that sleeps among high hills. Therefore, I'll make no phrase. Hear the plain truth. Hugh of Carliol is not dead. He lives! URSYNE. [Stupefied.] Hugh of Carliol is not dead! He lives! COUNT GEOFFREY. Send for thy cousin, and, if thou hast a heart Under that iron shell which seems a girl, Say this: Kind Heaven, perceiving her distress, Has heard our supplications and preserved Her bridegroom from that sleep the sword doth give More certainly than either drug or herb. URSYNE. [Repeating mechanically.] That sleep the sword doth give more certainly Than either drug or herb. COUNT GEOFFREY. What dost thou say? URSYNE. I say thy news is strange. COUNT GEOFFREY. I'll call Arlette, and, at the curfew bell, Th'assembled household shall give thanks to God For this deliverance from the enemy. [Count Geoffrey goes out. URSYNE. O, at his rumoured death my spirit left me To join its wild associate in pain. Then we were oneâto-night we are dissevered. I fall again to life as one that wakes From fierce delirium to the surgeon's knife, But to exchange the anguish of the mind For butchery's cold steel.âO, who would live, Or who would love this world or any on it, When penalties await each pitiful joy Snatched from the aching littleness of time! And he was mine, being dead, no barrier Could stay the dear approach of our two wills. Supreme, insatiable was the thirst Each owned for the other's self, till, made one wave, We lashed the world's harsh shore, and ever gained, Recoiling, newer force to smite that sand! This is no more. Already, love, thou'rt gone, And, as the amber east of this bleak morning Was fast obscured by clinging, feverous mists, So doth thy spirit fade from my desire, And all I journey with is emptiness! Enter Osbern. OSBERN. Ursyne! URSYNE. Alas! OSBERN. Alas! Hast thou no word save this? I hate Carliol and I curse the good news. So much, then, for my hate. But is thy love of such ethereal quality that neither death nor life affects it? Is it âAlas!â both ways? URSYNE. Yes, for my will is struggling against treason. If I kill the treasonâas I shallâ I must die for the sorrowful victory! And if my will is overpoweredâas it must not be âI shall perish from the shame of defeat. And thusâit is âAlas!â both ways! OSBERN. What wilt thou say to Carliol when he comes? URSYNE. There is nothing left to say. My heartâ which holds my wordsâis broken. OSBERN. [Passionately.] And me? and me? and me? Do you never think of me, or understand me? There are women who will give love for love. There are women who, seeing that they may save a soul by loving it, do love it for that reason! But you are cold, dumb, merciless! URSYNE. No, no If I still live, Osbern, it is because of thee. OSBERN. Ah! [Touches her hand.] Is this true? URSYNE. And I know moreâI would not have thee marry another. Take vows, dear Osbernâ take vows. Never marry. No woman could make thee happy. OSBERN. No other woman could make me unhappy! When I see some beauty, I ask myself, Could this paragon give me one minute of despair? I laugh! Ah, Ursyne, thou hast no cause for jealousy. Thou art the one source of my undying wretchedness. In this you have no rival! URSYNE. When I look at you, and hear you, I think it is well I do not love you. OSBERN. Why? URSYNE. Because I should have loved you far too well! Ah, had I known you ere Carliol came, Then all my life had changed from woe to rest, Then, as some poor white sail shines by the sun And seems a wing of brightness till the night, So I had been rejoicing in your love. But you were born for more than woman's praise, And I come as a sad song in your way, You'll hear me and pass on, and think at last, âI wonder was that song some winter's dream?â OSBERN. Extreme grief hath no fear, nor limit, nor shame ... Its violence, impalpable as the wind, Scatters our inmost nature till we seem Bare empty trees with neither wood nor leavesâ But only bark that's brittle, and soon dust! [Arlette enters, and Osbern goes out. Arlette comes timidly and takes a stool by the fire. Ursyne hesitates a moment and then goes to her. URSYNE. Why do you sit apart so white and still, And colour suddenly when footsteps follow? Why do you watch the burning embers till They flush too bright and in the ashes die? And, ever through your laugh, a cutting sigh Pricks through the mirth. My bird, Arlette, say truly. Is it because you mourn the dead unduly? ARLETTE. [Surprised.] The dead! Now, speak not of the dead! I pray Their souls may rest in peace. Thoughts more prolonged Spoil what remains to us, and, shedding tears, We miss an immediate glory. Is it not so? URSYNE. How love will teach the purest heart deception! My bird chirps well the teaching of the Church! ARLETTE. Those great long words, I know, are not my own, Yet I feel all their sense. URSYNE. [With mockery.] Why then this pallor! This pensive look when, supperless at night, You steal away to watch the glittering sky, And rise at dawn ere the empurpled clouds Have risen like mountains on the east horizon? When the last morning stars retreat to heaven, When the moon's light doth mingle with the sun's First radianceâmy Arlette then doth wake, It may be, murmuring prayers, but I think not! ARLETTE. Ah, dear Ursyne ... [She pauses. URSYNE. Now is the white face red, The bud becomes a flower, the thought a blush. Denials would be vain, my accusation Blames not the purity of your dreaming mind, For, where's the harm, though you are sick with love. The state is unfamiliar to your knowledge. How could you guess that when you search the clouds, Or sigh because a melancholy note Drives you to think the passingness of life Is all too swiftâthat this is loveânot wisdom! ARLETTE. I think if I did love I could discern The difference between an orison And this compelling, sweet, perpetual spell. I say, if I did love, Ursyne. URSYNE. And do you? ARLETTE. Should I declare outright that intimate secret I scarce could breathe even to him who holds My heart's allegiance? Help me, Ursyne. URSYNE. Here's woe indeed! [Osbern enters during following speech, unperceived by the two women. ARLETTE. Let me come near thee now. Stay with me but a while. It frightens me When, in a sombre mood, you fly away From my poor presence, and ominously talk To unseen ears. Somewhat I have to tell ... URSYNE. Nay, tell it not, save to the one who holds Thy heart's allegiance! The Earl still lives. Thy lover was not slain. Carliol comes To claim thy promised faith. [Voices heard from the chapel chanting the Te Deum. Arlette falls in a swoon. URSYNE. [Contemptuously.] Why does she fall? OSBERN. [With a sinister laugh.] I think it must be joy! Te Deum laudamus. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene: The great hall of the castle, showing entrance door at R. large staircase at back of stage. At L. a large fireplace, near it a narrow table spread with supper for two or three persons. At R. there is a high-backed carved-oak seat, long enough to seat several people. Torches are placed all round the hall, and garlands. Blanche and Jacqueline stand well forward. Enter Alan, an attendant. ALAN. Haste! Haste! Go, call our mistress. Soon they come. Soon shall we hear the trample of glad hoofs! Where is our lady? Ill will it seem and rude If she wait not with torch and outstretched arm To greet the miraculous coming of her lord. [He rushes out. At top of staircase Ursyne and Arlette appear, both carrying torches. Arlette leans heavily upon the staircase as she comes down. Ursyne is self-possessed and exultant. BLANCHE. Lo! she appears. Never was love like this Death, e'er its final triumphing, is such. JACQUELINE. Yet mark Ursyne! As Lucifer she shines Beside that perished light flickering in tears. [Ursyne and Arlette have now reached the foot of the staircase. ARLETTE. Have I my torch, Ursyne? URSYNE. Aye, hold it straight, As I do mine. Some little spark may fall And burn into your cheek the crimson hue Which joyous love strangely omits to paint there. ARLETTE. Stand close, Ursyne. Be near me when he comes. If I am wordless, and I think I shall be, Speak my just welcome. Say I honour him. But, say I honour him as handmaid should A majesty so high. ... If, because I seemâ If ... O, my heart doth sicken, stir and droop. I have done no wrong, and yet, a guilty wretch, I see this, as it were, a judgment hall, With yellow faces peering through the gloom, And all around black shapes and questionings. URSYNE. Give me your hand. Poor leaf, it flutters here, Vanquishing by its weakness my disdain, Drawing from my stone heart th'imprisoned pity I thought to keep there in its dungeon sealed. Osbern enters. OSBERN. [Shouting.] Carliol comes! Hail! my great cousin, hail! Carliol comes to see the immovable world Spin at his bidding! Miracles, no longer Worked on the commonalty, are for him Reserved. Arise, new Lazarus, from the grave! Sweet bride, it is Carliol; lift up thine eyes. Thou art a wife of youth! It is the Earl, Thy husband, thy beloved! It is he To whom thy being, body and soul, belongs. Flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone. The Law Is grand and overwhelming on that point. Ursyne, endorse my orthodoxy. Own That I speak words of simple edification! URSYNE. With an entireness love might wish less full! OSBERN. Ah, women think of love, men are for doctrine! I meant no more. ARLETTE. Would doctrine were enough! [Arlette moves away. OSBERN. Hath she seen Eadric since this news of Hugh? URSYNE. No. OSBERN. Hath she sent word to him by messenger? URSYNE. No. OSBERN. I would spare youth such grief. URSYNE. Art thou not young? OSBERN. [With sarcasm.] But have I grief? Am I not blessed and glad? Do I long, in my folly, for one look, One touch, one sight of creature that I love? Do I love? can I love? Nay, I'm too wiseâ My youth doth differ from all other youth! URSYNE. Ah, Osbern, on this night of desolate joy, I need thy care, not thy philosophy! OSBERN. My care? Is that then something in thy life? URSYNE. Nay, not somethingâall! [Carliol's voice is heard in the courtyard. The household form in two lines. Arlette and Ursyne stand together waiting to receive Carliol. Osbern watches them from the opposite side. CARLIOL. Heard without.] Give God the glory! [Enters. Nay, nay, you will unman me. I am stronger Before the enemy than with friends so kind. [Count Geoffrey goes towards him, leading Arlette. Arlette! ARLETTE. [Kissing his hand.] I am Arlette, but greatly altered. CARLIOL. [Embracing her and drawing her apart. This is Arlette, the child that I have dreamed of, When retrospects were all the semblance left me Of earth's delight: when, in an alien camp, A foe's uncertain charity watched me sleep, Thy shadow fell upon my measure of life, Making it rosy as the blossoming may In that fair garden where I walked with thee First, and told my love. Dost thou remember? URSYNE. [Aside.] At the last day much shall be pardoned me For that I suffer now. ARLETTE. There is Ursyne. CARLIOL. Ursyne! [Pauses, then goes towards her. URSYNE. My Lord. [They look at each other without speaking. OSBERN. [Dashing forward.] Now let us sup and dance! These unimaginable moments lack Th'appropriate language we would give to them. For daily talk and excellent occasions There is a stock of sentiments all wound Like skeins of wool around our tongues. We hold them Deliciously tinged for every use. But, for an hour like this, what's there to say? Light souls may leap; sound stomachs crave strong food And hearts of sensibility cease beating Fearing to live, lest th'ineffable silence Should be too swiftly broken by a word. COUNT GEOFFREY. [To Carliol.] Admirable sense! much lurks in that scorned head! CARLIOL. Poor Osbern! I had thought to see thee wed! 'Tis not in woman to neglect thy heart. And, never yet did men of our strong wills, Our race, our age, our temper, live without love! OSBERN. There's time for love. CARLIOL. Such patience sings a song! I know the tune. Husbands hum it oftenâ Under their breathâbachelors, who are fortunate, Whistle it while they run to meet their joy! [Turning to the company. This rascal hath a wife hid in some nest, Or else there is some virtuous, secret lady For whose chaste soul it is a pleasure to pray! OSBERN. [Bowing.] My cousin is too gracious in his wit. CARLIOL. [Bowing.] Cousin, you may be saint or trespasser, But either way a woman is the cause, And, as a ship, she's crossed thy life's wild pool And left her wake! Come, own! OSBERN. [Lightly.] And if I ownâ CARLIOL. [Giving him his purse. There's money for a gift. COUNT GEOFFREY. Most generous. OSBERN. [Returning it with mock courtesy. Spend this in masses for thine own soul, Hugh! I take thy jesting and thy cousinship For they are rights of blood. But, when I woo, My gifts must be my wrongsâcontempt and poverty; My claim must be my very lack of claim, My charm, my humours, and my gold, my grief! Yet, for her love, I'll give a love so vast, So constant, honest, true, and unremitting That queens shall weep because they know it not, And blame their courts because they teach it not, And hate their wealth because wealth buys it not! CARLIOL. Plainly, our Osbern must be kept from queens Or there shall be such scandalâ OSBERN. [Laughing.] Mere froth, cousin, Mere braggadocio: I have no love, I think I cannot feel: I am a grave, A grave without an epitaph. Alas! ARLETTE. [In terror.] Hark! hark! there's one that knocks. ALAN. [Peering out.] Some stranger comes. OSBERN. [With a sardonic glance at Arlette. To grace the festival with that scarce virtue We call a neighbour's love! CARLIOL. Bid him come in. ALAN. He rides a gaunt white horse. ARLETTE. [Aside.] Now let me steel My spirit's broken wing. Up, up, faint love, Thou hast a flight to fly past barbÃ¨d arrows. ALAN. [From the door.] It is Sir Eadric, son of that Saxon chief, Who, unbelieving in the Norman right, Did foolishly rebel. They hanged him high. I saw him swing for days. Can his son love us? CARLIOL. Still, let him enter. COUNT GEOFFREY. My lord, I know the knight, A bold, daredevil youth, mad at the chase, Impatient under law, despising all Who are not Saxon born. ALAN. No good, I'll swear. Will come from this admittance. [With veiled sarcasm.] Welcome, Sir Knight! Eadric enters, and advances, bewildered. ARLETTE. [Going to meet him and speaking with a strong effort. Welcome, Sir Eadric. Much we feel thy courtesy. 'Tis the acquittal from that debt of malice Accumulated 'gainst us both by fortune. And as beforetime there was enmity Let there be blessedness now. COUNT GEOFFREY. You see us here, Our senses all but overthrown with joy. Thanksgiving makes us dumb. 'Tis well that God, Who reads the secrets of all hearts, can weigh The gratitude that surges in us all. OSBERN. Much He will weigh, be sure, and much requite! EADRIC. [Bitterly.] My lord, I look upon this countenance, Which, being too young to smile deceitfully, Is to be read as well by men as angels! OSBERN. [To Ursyne.] Not all are blind that feel the scourge of love. Eyes washed by grief lose beauty but dust also! URSYNE. [To Eadric.] Sir Eadric may not know the instant cause Of our contentment. EADRIC. This only do I know, That where there are fair women there will be Causes enough, without intemperate wonder, To drown men in perdition. ARLETTE. Good Sir Eadric, Have gentler thoughts, you do misunderstand us. Carliol, whom we thought was foully slain, Hath come again. [The sound of the harpists tuning up is heard from the next room. COUNT GEOFFREY. And it is their betrothal, Doubly insisted on, that we celebrate. [Servants bring in dishes and place them on table. ARLETTE. [Staggering toward Ursyne.] Ursyne! URSYNE. She hath stood too long. EADRIC. I shall recount This day in my joy's calendar! CARLIOL. [Going to Eadric.] Sir Eadric, In time to come we'll speak of this event, Saying, The Saxon prince conquered unkindness, And, by that act, did make us bondsmen ever To his nobility. Come, my Arlette, Come, true chivalry's king! Old wine shall give Ripe feeling to new friendship! ARLETTE. [To Eadric.] Will you not come? OSBERN. What sly excuse shall be accepted for him? Pray, sirs, lead on. We, lacking brides, have hunger. Our uninspired bodies crave some food More real than beauty For indeed a man possesses most surely such good as he can put into his mouth and swallow. The rest is all appearance, phantasm, and the means to certain damnation. Lead on! Lead on! EADRIC. [To Arlette.] Madam, I'll sup to-night, and this brave welcome Will make my hard farewell a kind of grace. [Arlette goes to the table between Eadric and Carliol. Count Geoffrey makes a sign to Ursyne, which she disregards. Osbern goes to table, fills a goblet with wine and returns to Ursyne. ALAN. [To Osbern.] âWill make my hard farewell a kind of grace.â Blackish words! Arrogancy and desperation run unexpiated in his veins. Take good heed! We swung his father high. Ah, it is silliness to pass a wolf because one is hunting foxes. Take good heed! [He goes to help at the table. OSBERN. The Earl doth wear the proud apparel of glory As though he had digested it! This seems To have enriched his bones, glistened his eye, And filled his soul with satisfaction's balm. URSYNE. Thine eyes oft see that which thine heart would veil! OSBERN. His glanceâhis kingly strutâhis glory to God! Such are the men that women hang their souls on As votive trifles offered to the Highest. Trifles, with just the gift of fiery tears, Laughs, songs, smiles, blushesâall the armoury That puts weak flesh to torment: all the love That purifies our natural baseness. Trifles, which, made for heaven, may merit hell, By putting their whole trust on things like that! O, 'tis a poor affair! Poverty most sick! Why dost thou love him, Ursyne? Thy clear soul Hath immortality for better use Than this cold mountebank's pleasure. Did'st thou not see His tenderness to Arlette? URSYNE. Could one be rough To singing linnet frightened from her song? OSBERN. Could one not swear, watching his deepening gaze, The lowering of his voice, the arm's fond crook, That he had never loved a maid save Arlette, That his one thought, e'en ere her birth, through years Was ArletteâArletteâArlette! Never for him Had woman virtue, comeliness, delight, Away from Arlette. Hypocrite! Perjured! False! URSYNE. You do him wrong. Is there a man would feign He had loved oneâone only all his days? That fool I have not met. OSBERN. This fool doth say so! This fool must mean it too. His constancy Is thought his prime misfortune, but I know 'Tis the sole good he hath. Ah! doubt it not. Why dost thou love that, Ursyne? [Pointing to Carliol. URSYNE. Why dost thou Love me? If I could give thee reasons, Osbern, I might, by speaking them, perceive their frailty. There is some cure whilst one can pick and argue. The worst I know: that is the worst of all! If, by discovering some mote or blemish, Which, to my locked, enchanted sight had passed For beauties in the earliest, mad, glad fever, Then might I say it was the erring shadow Of my own fantasy that I had loved, No man at all, no soul, no great ambition.â But, 'tis not so. I see the one thou seest. The glanceâthe kingly strutâthe glory to God, All this I see. Yet, there is something more That hath escaped your jealousy, but not My heart. O, there's a winged spirit in him, That, when our eyes may meet, looks o'er the brink Of his humanity. This calls to mine, And, as the sun draws vapour, so I rise To that irresistible force. OSBERN. Alas, poor vapour! Alas! foul, trumpery sun, Lit up by artifice to shine at festivals On women! O, vile lier in wait for dreams! Never was talk so bitter-sweet of souls But soon the creature fell with bodily hurt Into a deep abyss. So help me God! I'll save thee if I die for it! URSYNE. Osbern, Thy death would be my loss, and not my safety. OSBERN. [Muttering.] Shall man do less than he ought, or venture less, Because Almighty God doth as he wills? URSYNE. Dear, we talk too long. I think they call me. OSBERN. I hear no call. URSYNE. Surely ... [Ursyne rises as though drawn by a compelling force and goes to the table. Osbern looks at her. COUNT GEOFFREY. How now, singers! [Singers come forward. There is a song; Osbern remains on the settle, watching moodily the group at the table; Muriel sidles up to him at the conclusion of the song. MURIEL. Sir, that's a sweet air. OSBERN. And the sentiment? MURIEL. Sweet! [Pauses.] I was loved once. OSBERN. Who was he? MURIEL. He died stone blind, and so he loved me till the end. OSBERN. Madam, some have passions of the mind; others have passions of the body. It is as vain to make a virtue of the one as it is blasphemous to despise the other. All power comes from God, whether in the flesh or in the spirit; yea, even the power to work evil. For out of evil itself comes nought but weakness, rottenness, destruction. MURIEL. Sir, if all knights wooed thus, the world would be free of much temptation! OSBERN. Listen, poor sparrow. I have really a great and terrible passion, but 'tis a spiritual madness, an intoxication of the mind and nerves. I have sunk into a well of unappeasable longings, which, not fixed for any mitigation in this world, have fastened on my soul like the desire, hunger, and thirst for death and deliverance. MURIEL. O, sir, is all this for me? OSBERN. God forbid! What, should I offer thee so meagre a gift as my eternal perdition? Timid dove! Thou must learn men better. There's a love can find its one expression in sympathy and all its happiness in understanding. This do I feel for thee. Adieu! MURIEL. 'Tis a sad case. He is not sick; this is sorrow of heart. [There is a dance, in which all join. At its conclusion the company scatter; Osbern and Ursyne come down stage. OSBERN. Thou hast danced well. URSYNE. Thy step suits. OSBERN. Mine? URSYNE. With thine. 'Tis the first time, I think, we two have danced, Or heard, together, music tuned for joy. Yet, of my life, this is the darkest night, The longest, saddest, weariest, last night. OSBERN. Wherefore last night? URSYNE. Day hath deserted me. OSBERN. Day comes at dawn. URSYNE. I shall not see the dawn. OSBERN. Art thou afraid? URSYNE. Of what? OSBERN. Of loving me. URSYNE. What meanest thou? OSBERN. This is false loyalty. URSYNE. You hurt my hand. OSBERN. I thought it was a flame! URSYNE. [Smiling.] Wouldst put it out? OSBERN. Nay; I would burn myself. URSYNE. [Musing.] And we have danced. OSBERN. As any lovers might! URSYNE. I forgot all. OSBERN. I lived. URSYNE. It was the harp Bewitched us so. OSBERN. No harp! URSYNE. Harps may do much. OSBERN. Hath love less power? URSYNE. Not less ... [Confused.] I know not. Let us but say we have been happy once. OSBERN. And is that all? URSYNE. It is the very world, And worlds again, and still a heaven of worlds! OSBERN. Happiness, once! URSYNE. Remembrance for all time. OSBERN. And then, despair! URSYNE. Then, waiting quietly. OSBERN. We were not happy onceâfor I was sad, Thou dost constrain thine heart and torture mine. This is not gladness; never think it is, Nor ever think 'twas either harp or dance Which gave thy face the perfume of the rose And something fairer than the rose's flush. This is love's miracle when love meets love! URSYNE. I met no love: it is too far from me. OSBERN. Need that have been? URSYNE. God saw that there was need! OSBERN. He sent me near. URSYNE. Thou art not he I loved. OSBERN. And yet one dayâ URSYNE. It was an Autumn day. You found me sleeping, and you watched me long Until I spoke and called you. OSBERN. In your dream! I answered you, and you stretched out your hand, And said, âThy love is stronger than our fate, Thy spirit, when I die, shall join with mine, And keep it fast for ever. This I know!â URSYNE. O strange and faithful words! That dream was true. OSBERN. Fate is strong ... URSYNE. As life. OSBERN. Love hath no master. And if I win ... URSYNE. I would not have thee fail! OSBERN. Tell me thy thought. URSYNE. Pure love doth conquer hell. OSBERN. I'll strive with ... URSYNE. What? OSBERN. With death and hell for thee. URSYNE. And never tire? OSBERN. Love tires not. URSYNE. Promise this. OSBERN. Hast thou a doubt? URSYNE. O, promise this to God! OSBERN. I promise it. URSYNE. Thy love shall save us both. OSBERN. Is there sore peril threatening us, Ursyne? Tell me thy thought. URSYNE. Thy love shall save us both! [She moves away. The bell is heard ringing for Matins. COUNT GEOFFREY. [Rising.] Now prayer and praise give unction to our peace. This holy hour will pour its consecration On hopes so long deferred, fulfilled at last. [He goes out, and all follow him into chapel, beyond where there should be an iron screen concealed by a curtain, which, being drawn back, may show the Monks passing through. Ursyne is following the rest, when Carliol intercepts her. Osbern escapes up the staircase, where he crouches. Ursyne waits for Carliol to speak. CARLIOL. Ursyne! I cannot pray. In agony All is sensation. My part shall be to kiss Lips that shall speak to me no more this night Till they have learnt some kindness, and are less Like scented alabaster, cut to tempt, Not to be tempted. [He embraces her. Ah, my very self, Long have I ached and fretted for this nearness, This heart more passionate than a wave, and purer E'en than th'intangible breeze that fans great storms. [She tears herself away. Ah, not so cold! Your snow puts out my fire, Is this a way to win love or to keep it? URSYNE. I had no way of winning or of keeping That which I gave to theeâmy faithful love. Faithful it is and love it is. What elseâ It would bereave theeâcouldst thou knowâto learn. When I did think thee dead, the woman in me Was all distinguished. Hast thou not seen lights Burn brightly for a while, then, suddenly, After some futile waving in the wind, Go out in utter darkness? I was so. CARLIOL. I'd sooner drink the wine of the condemned Than guess the saltness of thy tears. But look, We waste the moments men may hardly buy At grim Eternity's unchangeable price. A kissâthough nothing less or moreâa kiss! A brief close union of our arms.âMy life Was surely given back again for this. Much love. ... [He embraces her. URSYNE. But that is perfidy, not love! CARLIOL. Hast thou cast off all pity for me, Ursyne? URSYNE. Would that I had! CARLIOL. God put into my portion Certain advantages, which, falsifying Their promises, have turned into calamity. Vigour, high station, tastes, desires, aims Pitched far above my compeers; but, to mar allâ I was betrothed, while yet a senseless boy, Careful of beasts and dogsâamerced in muscle, A fellow most detestable, small doubtâ URSYNE. Ah, never! CARLIOL. Be that as it may. I was Betrothed, and, at the unlikeliest age for choosing. Nought do I urge against Arlette. URSYNE. You could not. CARLIOL. God save herâno! 'Tis innocence on earth Her eyes do swim in awe. It thinks, I swear, It has for husband Michael the Archangel!â No smaller prize! I would not have her make An idol of me, Ursyne! URSYNE. Let us pray not. CARLIOL. [With meaning.] Sweetheart, there is some future for us still. URSYNE. Aye, there's a future. [A pause. CARLIOL. Therefore let no gloominess Rob thy enchantments of their potency. Weave all around this burning heart thy charms, And Carliol the dauntless will be wax For these small hands to mould for good or evil. URSYNE. [Looks at him for some seconds before she speaks. My lord, this may not be.âWhat good I do (And even such as I may still do good) Must be by faltering prayers and not by witchcraft. What thy reported death did to my love This last hath well accomplished for my body. Shadows already seem to me like sisters. I'll come again. [He makes a protest. I have forgiven thee. I'll come again. [Ursyne goes into the chapel. [Osbern waits till she is out of sight, then creeps down the staircase and confronts Carliol. OSBERN. O, we are kin indeed! Whilst you are traitor, I am eavesdropping. I have no land, no patent of nobility, But I will make thee come into thy kingdom By shorter road than thou hast travelled yet! CARLIOL. What! dost thou play the madman in my presence? David, forsooth, before the wicked foe! As thou hast David's wit, show David's heart. He loved fair women! OSBERN. Aye! CARLIOL. When he repented, 'Twas not for fugitive, effeminate thoughts, But for some certain deeds which prophets censure, Philosophers define, and men commit! I love that lady. When the mad hour comes That preludes all true penitence, I'll beg Thine honourable absence. Virtue hath grace! [Osbern springs at him and strikes him to the heart with his knife. OSBERN. Fierce glittering snake in my dark wilderness! Evil am I, and evil too art thou! Thy love is cruelâmine is but a curse. From hell thou cam'stâto hell thou shalt return! [Strikes again. [The body falls so as to be concealed by a high-backed seat. Before curtain descends, Osbern creeps up the stairs stealthily, taking a torch with him. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III SCENE I Scene: The same as Act II. As curtain rises, Eadric comes out of the chapel, goes to the table where he had been sitting before, and sits there plunged in thought. A faint murmuring may be heard of the prayers in the chapel. This may last for two minutes, then the household come out of the chapel and pass up the stairs. Muriel, Jacqueline, and Blanche run across, followed by some men. Cecily and Henry are last. CECILY. Canst catch me, Henry? HENRY. If I wished I could. Women are easily caught. CECILY. Yes, they are full of kindness. HENRY. But they are better loved when they are less kind. CECILY. True, for man is such a reptile of ingratitude that he can only give love with cheerfulness where it is not wanted. HENRY. Dost doubt my love for thee, Cecily? CECILY. Nay, for I abhorâdetest, loathe and repudiate thee, therefore thou must love me for ever. There's no cure either way. We may make a happy marriage yet! [She rushes past him up the stairs, and he follows her amid laughter from the other girls. Eadric, as the household comes out, has stood aside. Arlette now comes out and looks round to see if they are overheard before she speaks to him. ARLETTE. And must you go? O, is't good-bye between us? When in old days I heard of woe like ours, I cried to think such sorrow ever was. EADRIC. And shall you be Carliol's happy wife? ARLETTE. I am his wife, for I am bound to him. EADRIC. But you love me? ARLETTE. Yes, so I bid thee go. I'll take my memory from its broken frame And give it up to God. I shall not think of thee, For, when I may, it will mean I love thee not. Now leave my soul, my heart, my mind, my sight While I can say good-bye and hear thee answer. ... EADRIC. Arlette! ARLETTE. Eadric! EADRIC. Yet he will call thee Arlette And watch this face and kiss these stars that weep. ... There's much for men to do, yet, when all's done, All's said, all planned, all's thought, there still is much That men have to forget. And this is hardest Of all his labour underneath the sun. Farewell, sweet Arlette, now an end is come To time and words! All that remains is life. [He kisses her hand; she unbars the door and lets him out. She leans against the doorpost and seems stunned with grief. Ursyne and Count Geoffrey come out of the chapel. COUNT GEOFFREY. I take it ill. There will be talk of this! And an example of indifference To Heaven's bounty. I fear lest swift rebuke Is near upon him. He should have joined us. [Ursyne, during this speech, has been looking down the stage to where she left Carliol; she now gives a piercing shriek, and throws herself upon her father, covering her eyes. URSYNE. O, I see forms and horrid spectres raised To drive me mad! COUNT GEOFFREY. How now, what ails thee, Ursyne! There are no spectres. This is some sudden sickness. Look up, look well, defy these childish fears! [Ursyne looks again, and this time seems petrified with terror. Geoffrey follows the direction of her gaze, and observes in the darkness the form of Carliol on the floor. COUNT GEOFFREY. [With a laugh.] 'Tis Alan drunk again. Ho! thereâa torch! Discipline at these times is hard maintained. A torch, I say! URSYNE. [Slowly.] Then, dost thou see it too? [She leaves him and glides down to the body, kneels and lifts the head. COUNT GEOFFREY. [Going up and out, calling.] Ho! thereâa torch! [Arlette comes down from doorway, bringing with her a torch from over it. She brings it down close and sees Ursyne in the darkness holding the head of Carliol in her arms. ARLETTE. But there is blood upon himâseeâthere is blood! URSYNE. [Slowly.] This wound cannot be stanchedâhe hath been dead A little while. [After a long pause. Who hath done this, Arlette? ARLETTE. How should I know, Ursyne? URSYNE. This is base murder. ARLETTE. Hath he an enemy? URSYNE. Thou couldst answer that. ARLETTE. Indeed, there's no one who would hate Carliol. URSYNE. Oh, crowning falsehood! Cast no thorns in mine eyes! ARLETTE. What meanest thou by these harsh blamable words? His very enemies praised him. URSYNE. A bad sign. An enemy's praise heralds all treachery, And grows the sweeter as revenge looks surer! Who praised him last? ARLETTE. All truly praised him always! URSYNE. My life for yours if this crime hath no punishment! I could have pardoned much hadst thou not lied. But to stand there with innocent, startled face As though some eagle had thee in his claw, When thou art full to th'crop with deadly venomâ Deceit past our conception and all credenceâ That fear would rather be for honest eagle, Who touched a thing so stuffed with perfidy! Think of the name thou never utterest! ARLETTE. [With a cry of horror as though a sudden suspicion struck her. Eadric! [Then hastily covers her face with her hands. URSYNE. [Laughing.] Had Eadric cause to work Carliol harm? Sayâhad he cause, urged on by thy white evil To plot and execute this coward's thrust? [Gazing down on Carliol. Death never gathered pain from face more tranquil. No fearfulness is here. This filthy world Has ta'en its cruellest tax. [Kisses the brow. I'll come again. [She rises, quits the body, and goes towards Arlette. I would have spared theeânay, I shall spare thee yet. The vengeance that cries out in me still fails From all its purpose, for as I loved thee once, And thought thee pureâhabit remains to bind A judgment horribly reversed by proofâ By hideous proof of thy corruption. Yet ... I cannot forsake thee. ... But, for the mean, false, fierce, and brutish villain, Who taught thee how to lie, and schooled thy glance To look on murder with a little gaze, There is no mercyâ [Enter Count Geoffrey, followed by Alan. Alan bears two torches, one in each hand. URSYNE. Come, why do ye wait? Carliol hath been dead this little while. COUNT GEOFFREY. [Going over to the body and kneeling by it. God in high heaven! ALAN. Is there a God or heaven? URSYNE. Aye, drunken ape! there are both, and something more. Canst thou, through thy drugged wits, detect the hand That could inflict a stab on heart so rare? ALAN. The Saxon hath done this. Did he not speak Of hard farewells? This is that in good faith! I did foretell it all. God rest his soul! Help! help, there! help! God rest his soul! Here's murder! [Some of the men of the household come down the staircase and go toward Count Geoffrey. COUNT GEOFFREY. Lift up his body with great reverence. He was a king of princes, and a knight Who fought no foe save infidelity, and loved His enemy as himself. Most brave Carliol! URSYNE. Let the dead bury their dead! Shall we shed tears? Shall we lament while we should be avengers? Eadric hath done this.âEadric then must die for it. Then, when bare justice hath been satisfied, There will be time enough to greet the sorrow I dare not yet encounter, and, for this present, Hold far away lest its kiss come too soon! COUNT GEOFFREY. Hath Eadric gone? Did any see him leave? ALAN. [Pointing to door of chapel.] He knelt there by the door, and rose from's knees Before the Fidelium AnimÃ¦ was reached, Or I had thought of waking. His gross step Disturbed the servants' prayers, but when he murdered He had a lighter grace! I heard no noise. COUNT GEOFFREY. Then let us hunt this hell-rat! I'll not sleep Nor eat, nor rest, until the time to weep. [The men lift the body on to a bench. Ursyne stands by, looking down upon the face. Arlette does not move from the floor where she is crouching. Count Geoffrey and the men go out. END OF SCENE I. SCENE II Scene: Osbern's room. Osbern is sitting on his bed. OSBERN. Nay, no remorse: no wishing that undone Which, being done, sends triumph, like hot smoke, Through all my veins, till I seem as a cloud Floating in the pre-eminent infinite, and gathering Fresh transports while I move. O, depths and heights! If I know not thy joy I know thy fury, And, whirling in thy giddy impetus, I toss On thy distracted currents. Love is not mine, Th'obliteration of self in passion's intense Delight;âthe horror of war and its mad issue 'Midst fire and pain and blood and arroganceâ The odour of death and groans of wounded menâ The carrion crows for corpses and the banquet For licensed murderersâthese two are not In my damnation! But, I have killed a spirit So vile, corrupting and insidious That it could seem a man and flatter life By adding to the crowd of things existent His admirable form. His heart could bleed: I saw the purple stream. Its lethal fumes Have crept from thought to thought till all I feel, Or know, or think, or have remembrance of Is that first thrill on touching his life's pulse With this keen blade. Yet if they slay me now, Would not wild joy so steep my mind in gladness That torture would be impotent, and death But the augmentation of my consciousness, Increasing bliss somewhat restrained and vexed By this confinement in the body's cell. [A knocking is heard. They come for me. HENRY. [Outside.] Sir, sir, open the door! OSBERN. Is there such haste? HENRY. O, sir, 'tis past all haste! [Osbern opens the door and Henry enters. OSBERN. [Surprised to see him alone.] Did you dare come alone? HENRY. Aye, sir, to you. 'Tis a fair haven here. I'll tell thee all. First let me bar the door. OSBERN. Wouldst sit with me? HENRY. I trust none other after this night's deed! I've heard of chattering teethâmine chatter now! Carliol hath been butchered by Sir Eadric! OSBERN. What's this? Speak clearer! Who hath done it? Speak! HENRY. The Earl went not to Matins. He erred through wine, And sate unarmed, asleep, helpless, alone, With half the torches gone, and not a soul To warn him of Sir Eadric's stealthy step. He crawled from prayers and crept along the floor, And smote the great Carliol as you hit Some swinish beast. The blood came pouring out. OSBERN. Didst thou then see Sir Eadric when he struck? HENRY. Nay, but that's how he struck. 'Tis the received Belief, none can gainsay the truth of that. Our lady Arlette grows into the earth, So low is she with sorrow. Lady Ursyne ... OSBERN. Ursyne! HENRY. She watcheth by the body and doth seem More used to death than life. Count Geoffrey hunts The murderer, and hath sworn to take no rest, Nor bite, nor slumber, till he hath the wretch, And burnt his eyes in their sockets, and quartered him, And drawn him limb from limb, and hanged him high To rot and shake in chains on some bleak tree On ground accursed for ever! O, that he had Ten bodies to be slaughtered! One skinful of flesh Is not enough to appease our appetite For vengeance! OSBERN. Is Ursyne pale? HENRY. So paleâ She is as white as rain, and seems to fall Although she is upright. OSBERN. Have they left my horse? HENRY. Nay, Alan rides him. OSBERN. Then get me what thou canst. Wait not for bit or saddle; I must ride And overtake the pursuers ere they slake Their thirst in innocent blood. GoâI will follow. [Henry goes and Osbern looks round the room. Walls, ye have seen much suffering: the worst Must be endured in ravenous publicity. Yet, when I die, I'll think of this bare room, And wonder if the grave will be so gentle As these still granite wings! ... For the last time. [He looks round the room and dashes out. END OF SCENE II. SCENE III Scene: The same as Scene I. Ursyne is standing by the bier, at each corner of which a torch burns. Arlette crouches on the ground at the foot of the body of Carliol. A lad is waiting by the door. The monks are heard chanting in the chapel: Dies, irÃ¦, dies illa, Solvet sÃ¦clum in favilla, Teste David cum Sibylla. Quantus tremor est futurus, Quando Judex est venturus, Cuncta stricte discussurus! [As they finish this verse, Osbern appears at the top of the staircase and loud shouting of men is heard at the door. It is opened by the lad. Count Geoffrey, Alan, and other men drag in Eadric, who is bound, pinioned, and gagged. COUNT GEOFFREY. Bring in the slayer. Confront him with the slain. Look on thy handiwork: drink in the sight, For 'tis the last that thy malignant eyes Shall see till they awake to scorch in hell. ARLETTE. Wilt thou not let him speak? OSBERN. Unloose those cords And bind them where they fit more righteously! If there were guilt in sending this bright toad Down to th'infernal slime wherein he grew, Then lay this to my charge, for I am guilty! URSYNE. All I have ever loved! O, my soul dies. [She looks down at the knife in Carliol's belt and her hand moves toward it. COUNT GEOFFREY. [To Osbern.] This grief, poor Osbern, hath estranged thy reason! Wert thou arraigned for this mad, heinous crime, It would go hard with thee. I could not spare Where God most merciful hath cursed. The penalty Is so severe that, thinking on't, my bones Melt, and all my blood is changed to brine. OSBERN. Ah! take thy justice. Here's my knifeâ'tis stained! ALAN. What! shall fiends walk among us boasting thus Of their iniquity? [The men rush upon Osbern and seize him. URSYNE. [Rousing herself.] First loose the innocent. [The men leave Osbern and go to Eadric. Ursyne goes up to Osbern, concealing behind her the knife. URSYNE. Osbern! [A look passes between them. She turns to Count Geoffrey. Let me speak with him. [They step apart from the others. OSBERN. No words. URSYNE. This was fierce jealousy. OSBERN. Not jealousy. Yet I was jealous. And it was not doubt: Although I doubted. God!â URSYNE. It was not fear, Fear is not in thy nature. What then was't? OSBERN. A jest one thought too deep: it sank to hell: I kept it thereâlest it should crawl to thee. URSYNE. They'll burn thine eyes, and draw thee limb from limbâ OSBERN. Don't weep for thatâ URSYNE. And torture thee and hang thee ... OSBERN. All too quick. I'd have more time for lovingâ I'd have more time to think on thy farewell, And dream again I danced with thee one night, And know again, in memory, the scent Of that white flower, thy face. I need no sight. URSYNE. My kinsmen, once resolved, do never pause From their intent. And I foresee such thingsâ OSBERN. Man must deal justice; mercy is with God. I pray to Godânot men. Here I'll not falter. The end is nearly come. ... God forgives much. He suffered much. URSYNE. The flood of pain that waits thee Fills up the cup of vengeance to the brim, And flows till hate itself is drowned in anguish. [Hoots and cries are heard outside. COUNT GEOFFREY. All hell will soon be loosed! Horror on horror Presses. URSYNE. [To Osbern.] What I shall do, I do for grief, not hate. [Aloud.] Soâere a worse befall theeâI give thee this, In token of my wrath and some compassion. [She stabs him; she covers her face and reels backward with a cry; Count Geoffrey rushes forward, but Osbern stands between them and takes Ursyne in his arms. OSBERN. Leave us together now: have I not won? She's mine. O Ursyne, thou art mine at last! Had I another heart to be thus riven I'd take its agonies surpassing all I've felt, To know again thou caredst enough for me, O, my beloved, to do this mortal sin! URSYNE. The night is gone and morning is come unto me ... Yet ... am I still alone? OSBERN. [Points in the distance.] See ... see ... one waits! My love shall save us both: 'twas given for this. Our path is scarleted though not with flowers! Our hearts must hover o'er that smoking chasm Which reaches to the nethermost. But lookâ Not downwards; love, we are not wingless yet, Still may we rise though centuries shall pass Ere we can reach the sky! [He kisses her as she dies, then rolls over on his face, dead. ARLETTE. O, are they dead? COUNT GEOFFREY. Now let the world come in! EADRIC. Rest to their spirits! Satan hath tried them sore. God shall adjudge them now: man, never more! [The Monks are heard chanting in the chapel. Recordare, Jesu pie, Quod sum causa tuÃ¦ viÃ¦: Ne me perdas illa die. THE END.</field>
