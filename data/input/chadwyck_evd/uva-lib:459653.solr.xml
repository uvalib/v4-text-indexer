      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable Sir Henry Lord Cary, Baron of Hunsdon, Viscount Rochford, Earle of Dover, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his worthie friend the Authour, Master Thomas Heywood. Heywood, when men weigh truly what thou art, How the whole frame of learning claimes a part In thy deepe apprehension; and then see, To knowledge added so much industry; Who will deny thee the best Palme and Bayes? And that to name thee, to himselfe is praise. As first, which I must ever first preferre, Thy skill in PoÃ«try, where thou so farre Hast gone, as none beyond thee, and hast writ, That after-ages must despaire of wit Or matter to write more. Nor art thou lesse, In whatsoere thy fancy will expresse. Thy pen commands all history, all actions, Counsels, Decrees, men, manners, States, and factions, Playes, Epicediums, Odes, and Lyricks, Translations, Epitaphs, and Panegyricks: They all doe speake thy worth. Nor dost thou teach Things meere prophane; but thy great Muse does reach Above the Orbes, unto the utmost skie, And makes transition unto Deitie. When thou with such high straines detainst our eares, As might become the Angels, or the Spheares. What Reader then in justice can decline From this assertion? Poets are divine, Rapt with a heavenly fire, which is made knowne By no example better than thine owne. Sh. Marmion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the learned Authour Master Thomas Heywood. VVho can deny but Poets take their birth From some thing that's more excellent than earth: Since those harmonious strains that fill our eares, Proclaime their neere allyance with the Spheares, And shewes their Art all Arts as farre exceed As doth the fiery-Cane, the weakest Reed. That Matter which six lines of Prose rehearse, May fitly be contained in one Verse; Yea, and so pithily (if well compacted) That out of it whole Bookes may be extracted, A President whereof if thou wouldst find, I prethee gentle Reader bend thy mind To what this little Volume doth containe, And sure the fruit will recompence thy paine. The subject with the Authours names agree, Who all have left unto Posteritie Such Noble badges of their learned fame, That my weake Pen can no way shew the same; Therefore doe thou, Ã´ Heywood, weare the Bayes As thy just merit many thousand wayes. For this thy Worke, with others heretofore Shall honor thee till time shall be no more. D. E.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my praise-worthy friend Master Thomas Heywood. Thy Worth unto the Knowing World is knowne, Let Criticks censure others by their owne, And tinct their foreheads with a purple shame, When they shall see thy Works, or heare thy Name, Whilst with thy owne, thou setst forth others fame; Whose lofty Anthems, in our English tone Thou sing'st, and mak'st them live, though dead &amp; gone, What barking or untutor'd Momus then Will dare to belch against thy learned Pen? Whose worthier Lines, unto their foule disgrace, Shall spit defiance in a brasen face; And when th'art dead, thy PoÃ«sie shall sing Such pleasant straines, whereof the World shall ring; And Envies selfe, in spight of all Assayes, Shall crowne thy Tombe-stone with eternall Bayes. S. N.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument. Io, of whom we next discusse, Daughter toth' River Inachus, (The fairest Nymph that liv'd that time, As being in her youth and prime) Was seen by Iove, lov'd, and comprest. Queen Iuno, Her, as of the rest, Growne Iealous o're, doth project lay, How in their sports them to betray. Whom to prevent (I know not how) But Iove transhapes her to a Cow. The Goddesse knowing how indeard She was to him, comes to the Heard, And begs this Heifer. He not dar'd (However the request seem'd hard) Her to deny. Shee's now her charge, And nought her freedome can inlarge. The passages that hence may grow, The sequell will hereafter show.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter IÃ´, Daphne, with other Nymphs called Naiades, the Daughters of the Rivers neere adjacent. Io. Here, Daphne, by your father Peneus streams (which falling from the top of Pindus mount, Waters Hemonian Tempe) let us sit, All daughters to the Rivers flowing neere: There old Apidanus steales (murmuring) by; Next, Poplar-shadowed Enipeus glides: Not far, Amphrisus, Ãas, and 'mongst these, (Not least) my father, good old Inachus Lifts up his reverend head, with fresh floures crown'd, Prescribing lawes and limits to his streams, To bound them in their channels, curb their torrent, Lest in their pride they should o'reswell their banks; Commanding them, through thousand strange indents To pay his plenteous tribute to the seas. Daphne. And how much are we bound vnto the gods, (Faire Io) to be Nymphs, not generated From marish Meares, nor yet from standing Lakes, From sedgy brooks, thick pooles, or shallow foords, Nor yet from violent and robustuous seas. Their waters keep a smooth and gentle course, Not mov'd to fury by the warring windes; Nor when loud fluxes fall to swell their bounds, And make deep inundations on the meads: Nor can the parching drought so dry their springs, But that their channels keep a temperature: Their modest shallowes serve us for coole baths In summer time to play and wanton in: Their depths, to bate our hookes with wormes and flies, Fastned to lines made of small twisted silke, And so betray the creatures of the floud. Their chrystall waves are Myrrhors, in the which We dresse our heads, and put these curles in forme, Sometimes so cunningly, as if that Art Had power to exceed Nature: and againe, With carelesse, but so curious a neglect, As if meere Chance did antecede them both. This makes us of the Satyrs so admir'd, And of the Faunes and Swaines so much belov'd. Io. Why, have you Sutors, Daphne? Daphne. Besides such, (For these my father, by whose will I am swayd) Accounts as mean) of Gallants I have change; Both City and the Court. Io. But I may claim Prioritie above all water Nymphs, Nor can the Naiades compare with me; No, Daphne, not your selfe. The rurall Swaines, They gather from these banks mellifluous floures, And make you chaplets to adorn your browes, And shadow your choice beauty from the Sun, Nay thinke them costly Presents: but I'am one To whom the gods themselves have offred gifts. Then before all the daughters of these flouds I claim a just precedence. Daph. By what dream, Or rather by what brain-sicke fantasie Hath Io been deluded? Io. My apprehensions Are no weake fantoms to beguile the sence, But reall, and in action; with their form They beare a being substance. Daph. Hath your Beauty Had amongst men such long and strange neglect, That Io would to colour such disgrace, Accuse the gods of weaknesse? Io. Let earths Beauties Censure of Earth, meere terren as yours be, And aime no further: the while this of myne Shall be new question'd by the Powers Divine. Daph. Now by what gods, for Heav'ns sake? Io. Not the meanest, Or such as we call under-deities, As melancholy Saturn, (by his son Exil'd and banisht from the supreme rule) As PhÅbus, a meere Vassal to the earth, And forc'd each naturall day to measure heaven; As Neptune, Soveraign o're the Seas, to whom Our tributary rivers hourely pay: As Mercury, though son to Iove himselfe, No better than his Foot-boy or his Page, Compeld at every summons to his speed: But of the potent Thunderer. Daph. He of whom You have learn'd to thunder these impossible braves. Io, I am asham'd. Io. Yes, that your beauty's Composed of the grosser elements, Want that attraction to call Iove himselfe Downe from his heavenly Fabrick, to behold Vs in our eminence. Daph. Strange wonder sure, To looke vpon that face in which we Mortals, And value it at best, can nothing spy, Breed admiration in a Deity! A noise of thunder. Enter Iupiter in his glory, his Trisull in his hand burning; at sight of whom they stand afrighted. Io. Appeare, Iove, in thy glory, let them know Ei, sham'd confesse their fond surmises vain, And what it is, thy god-head to prophane. Daph. Fly, fly, lest we be thunder-strooke, away; Let's seeke our safety, danger's in our stay. Exit. Iup. Thou Daphne, who Ioves presence now dost shun, Swifter ere long shalt from Apollo run. But there lie that which makes us terrible, Affrighting gods and men. Io to thee In calmes I come, and Faire one make me proud, To seale the love which I so long have vow'd. Io. What steale? what vow? Iup. Both thou shalt finde imprest On thy smooth cheeke, soft lip, and Ivory brest. Io. Forbeare to handle; yet I never knew A man so bold and rude: Can gods dispence, To teach us Women unknowne impudence? Iup. Nay rather we solicit you to prove What yet you have not try'de, the sweets of love. Io. Things that I would not learn. Iup. A Truant still? If you want art, Io, I can teach you skill: Give me your hand, your lip: why these but are The Prologue to a pastime much more rare. Women by nature are ambitious, and Long to know what they do not understand. I'le practise you in that which you before Ne're knew. Io. In all this lip-sport? or what more Is in these kisses meant? I am so dull,â Iup. All these my Comment shall explain at full. In vain you strive. Io. Should I do ought save well, I were vndone, my fathers flouds would tell; These are his banks, they'l blab: What mean you? fie; They swell above their bounds, only to spie And see what we are doing. Pish, away, Such deeds of darknesse can you do by day? Besides, shall I consent to what you mean, Not all these silver drops can wash me clean. Iup. Where I doe stain I can again make pure: And that Day shall not hinder us, be sure: Arise you fogs and damps, your vapors gather, To shroud us both from Iuno and thy father. Io. You make me blush. A great damp ariseth. Iup. These blushes none shall see; Behold these mists, to curtain us and thee. Io. Well, when what most you sue for, you have won, My comfort is, I see not what is done. Iup. And Io now I'le teach thee sports untry'de, In darknesse best a Virgins blush to hide. Exeunt Enter Iuno. Iuno. Not in the heav'ns? where then? In vain it were To search the seas; the blew-vein'd NereÃ¦, And green hair'd Dorides with all their brats, Styl'd by the names of water goddesses, (Though Prostitutes to Neptune) 'mongst them all Yeeld not a face to please his curious eye. Where then? The earth? I that, if any place, Yeelds choice of tempting Beauties: Argos bred A golden DanaÃ«, Thebes afforded an Alcmena and wanton Semele; Pelagia, a Calisto; Sparta nurst A swan-like LÃ¦da, (Strumpets) of all which I sought a sure, but found a vain revenge. Why may not then Thessalian Tempe yeeld Like fascination, since their impudence Is more and more encourag'd by my wrongs: Here then I make inquiry. The day's cleare; Whence come these foggy mysts that choke the aire, In so serene and bright an hemisphere? Aut ego faller, aut ego ledar. If from the earth, this sudden overcast Would smell of thicke and suffocating damps: If from the aire, or any sulph'rous fire, It would be found by their caliditie. If from the Rivers, or these moorish fennes, Humiditie would tell vs whence they were. No, these are forc'd, and by some god-like power, Created for a more peculiaruse: And now my jealousie most truly prompts me, 'Tis some illusion, made to blinde myne eies From a new injury; which if I finde, On this one Strumpet I will study more, Than all that have my vengeance scap'd before. Exit. Enter Iupiter, and Io transformed into a Cow. Iup. The clamorous Queen's descended from the Spheres, To finde the cause of this illusive Fog: But Io I have so transhap'd thee now, That she by no means can discover thee; And in that confidence I'le front her boldly. Iun. Iove heare? my jelousies are then not vain, Howe're I'le give him gentle entertaine, Concealing what's within. Iup. My lovely Iuno? Iun. My Brother and my Husband Iupiter? Iup. What make you here on earth? Iun. What other reason, But that I mist my soveraign Lord in heaven; And then I yoakt my Peacocks, to their bills Ty'd silken bridles, and in my light chariot Made of fine gold, and deckt with Estrich plumes, Descended as you see. But what affaire (Might Iuno be so bold to aske her Lord) Detaines you now in Tempe? Iup. Though it fits not Your Sex to aske a thing that ill beseemes, Or pry into the counsels of the gods; Yet thus much I'le resolve you? I came downe To censure here some causes amongst men, And set things crooked upright. Iun. Now I spy That which hath drawne him headlong from the sky, And I will make th' Adulterer himselfe Author of my iust vengeance. Iup. Thou once gon, Spoken aside. She were again transhap'd, and we both one. Sweet Iuno will you once more mount your Chariot, And keep your state above. My designes ended, I will not long be from you. Iun. My craft now Shall match his cunning; if there be in me A godhead, I have cast her destiny. Deare loving Lord, since 'twas my kindenesse drew me To see vnto your safety (though I know The Deities in every place secure) Give me some gift on earth, that I in heaven May applaud your royall bounty. Iup. Be it bred Beneath the Moon, 'tis my Saturnia's. Iun. I have not seen so sweet and lovely a Beast White without spot or stain; Is she of the herd Belonging to these Medowes? Iup. She is, no doubt. Why doth my Iuno aske? Iun. To make her myne. Iup. A gift too small for Iuno to entreat, Or Iove to grant; Demand some greater boon. Iun. This Cow or nothing. Iup. Shee's not for thy use; What would my Love do with her? Iun. Only this, (Being above the rest most beautifull) To sacrifice her to your Deity. (Iupiter starts.) Iup. Not for the triple world: What was it, Sweet, That you of me demanded? Iuno. Now to know (Aside) What put you in this feare? Nay I have beg'd, And must not be deny'd. And have I found you? Iup. In what a streight am I? her to betray, And give her up into her enemies hand, In man would prove a savage cruelty, Much more in us: and to deny a gift Appearing of so small a consequence, Would but augment her too much jelousie, And open that which is as yet conceal'd. Iuno. What hope have I to enioy greater things, That am deny'd a trifle? Iup. Say I will not, (Aside) And give no reason; it may then appeare, This Heifer to be no such as she seems. Well, she is yours; but how will you dispose her? Iun. So carefully, because she is your gift, My seruant Argus with a hundred eyes Shall guard her from all dangers. Iup. 'Tis enough, In that, to us you shall expresse your love. But prove he to her churlish or vnkinde, (Aside. There's one, at once his hundred eies shall blind. So, she is now your charge. Exit. Iun. And being myne, I'le teach base Earth to injure what's divine. Where is my seruant Argus? Enter Argus with a hundred eyes. Argus. Who's that calls? The sacred goddesse Iuno? What new service Will you command your vassal? Iun. Tak't in briefe; Beholdst thou This? This? This no matter what, Not worth a name; only a thing I loath; Out on thee: But I'le spare my railing words, To expresse my hate in action. Arg. What's the cause The poore beast trembles thus? Iun. A Beast indeed: Like such she shall be us'd; behold her, Argus; Are these lips fitting for a god to kisse? These hoofes apt palms to gripe? these teats fit pillowes? On which a Deity should brest himselfe? These, eyes to tempt? or this an hide to touch? These hornes? (Ã´ me) in myne owne heraldry She mocks me without blushing. Argus. In all this How will you use my service? Iuno. As a Spy: An hundred eyes thou hast, of all which number I will allow thee two to sleep by turnes; The rest to watch this Strumpet; and of all, But two to winke, the rest to gaze at full: Behinde thee thou hast eyes, both sides, before; Which way soe're thou turnst shee's in thy view. âA thousand he had need, all piercing bright, âTo watch a Lover from his choice delight. Arg. And is this all? Iuno. Something I had forgot: Thou art an Herdsman, Argus, and thou know'st To tame vnruly cattell; she is such: In some unworthy halter binde her neck, For such a Beauty the first Carkanet. Her browsing be the Brakes and bitter couche, For dainties feed her with the sourest herbs; Lead her through briers &amp; brambles, which may scratch Her itching skin even till her soft sides bleed, Raise vp the mud in cleare springs when she drinks, Keep her from shadow, in the parching Sun, Till she be stung with horse flies, and the brees: Let her not rest but where the ground's still bare; Feather her bed with thistles and sharp thornes; And for her footing chuse the barren paths Strow'd with loose pointed flints to gall her hoofes. Argus farewell, I leave her to thy trust, A sweet reuenge for her insatiate lust. Exit. Argus. Drawing this piece of Beasts flesh thus along, Me-thinks I looke like Lybian Hercules Leading the Dog of hell: nay I shall fit her According to my charge, and I will keep thee (Calfe with the white face) safe enough from bulling, The longest day that I haue eye to see. What do you hang an arse? Ptrow, come along, I'le leade you to bare feeding, and finde sallets To take downe your full flanks and these plump cheeks. Along, I'le watch thee well en ough from shrinking Necke out of collar. Nay, on; thou shalt finde, Though my face from thee, I have eyes behinde. Exit. Enter Inachus the father of Io, Peneus, Appidanus, Amphrisus, (all Riuers) Daphne, and the other Nymphs, &amp;c. Inachus. Speake not to me of comfort, Io's lost! Had she miscarried on the earth, her body Would have given instance of her timelesse fate: Or had she been by savage beasts devour'd, Her garments stain'd with bloud would tell her death. Had she in myne or these my neighbour floods Perisht, they would have borne her gently vp, And cast her on some banke for buriall. Peneus. Deare Inachus do not torment your selfe, Nothing so lost, but may be found at length: For hauing seen no token of her death, There's of her life some hope. Amphr. Behold, Amphrisus With this your antient neighbour Appidan, Peneus and others, as we moane your losse, So in our pitty come to comfort you. Appid. O, brackish not your waters with your teares, That yet run pure and fresh; but be of comfort. Inach. In vain you speake of what you cannot give, As I in vaine lament myne Io's losse. Enter Argus leading in Io. Arg. How now, curst Cow? What, start you at that name? I'le make your long hornes shorter. Inac. Io, where? If under earth, I'le send my springs in search As low as to the Centre. Io, where? If snatcht vp in the aire, like dew exhal'd, With eyes fixt vpward I will still thus gaze, Till from the bosome of some gentle cloud, Thou drop into myne armes. Faire Io, where? Arg. I thinke the beast hath breezes in her taile, She cannot keepe her still. Inach. But stay, what's hee That leads the fairest Heifer tether'd fast, That e're drunke of my streames; for Io's sake I loue all creatures that are beautifull. Arg. How now you Harlatry? Inach. Thou churlish heardsman, I know thee, Argus, jealous Iuno's Spy, Why canst thou be so fierce to one so faire? Arg. What's that to thee, or any of you all. Pen. Amongst all creatures Nature ever made, Some to have native beauty 'bove the rest, Commanding soft affection, this is such. Arg. With all myne eyes I spy no difference, But love all beasts as beasts. Inach. The more beast thou. Pen. But why should this, the fairest of all heards, Cast such a pitteous moving eye on you, As wooing your acquaintance? Inach. And 'tis true, Where ere I go, her sad eye followes me, So she too, did not Argus keepe her backe: See, see, how gently she endures my touch, And makes an offer (had shee power) to speake. Heare, take these floures, and now she kist myne hand, Whilest pitteous teares drop down her tender cheeks. What should I say? poore beast I pitty thee, And all the good I can do is to grieve, Th' hast such a churlish Keeper. Pen. Inachus, I feare There's something greater in't. Inach. What greater can be, Vnlesse there live some vnderstanding spirit In this irrationall and savage shape: What wouldst thou have, that in this bestiall figure Beg'st humane pitty? what intends she, thinke you, By pawing on the ground? Observe her, brethren, It seemes she hath writ somthing in the dust, And see, two letters are imprinted faire, As if it were my Io's Character, And here I reade Io. Pen. Io: and see, in every step she hath trod, That word imprest. Inach. This she? whom I so long in vain have sought, Through forrests, groves, and mountains, fields &amp; floods? This she, whom I in finding shall most lose? O miserable wretched Inachus, More miserable Io, thus transform'd: I terme thee lovely, till I knew thee such; But when thy former beauty I record, Thou ougly art, mishap'd, and terrible. Can the gods suffer this? Arg. Leave this your howling. Forbeare, or in this cord I leade her forth, Ile strangle her. Dare not to follow me, There's danger in me both waies; she shall perish, And you must bleed. Come, Minion we will clime Yon craggy mountain top, a prospect fit For Argus only, who (not moving) can Behold at once from whence the foure winds blow, And there with her I'le like a Beacon stand, To watch and to give warning. Will you drive? I say pursue me not, for if you do, Ile make her sure, and you repent it too. Why ptrow there. (Exeunt Argus and Io. Amph. With what a pitteous action, wailing tongue, She gave a loving, but a loath farewell. Apid. But that the high Powers are not limitable, Who would beleeve this wonder possible. Pen. We must not question what the gods can do, Yet in th' extremitie of all extremes, And worst of bads, despaire not, Inachus. Inach. How easie 'tis for those that tast not griefe, Bid others be of comfort. Amph. Reverend Sir,â Inach. There is no reverence due: not to the gods, If this be seen and suffer'd: O my Io. With acclamations I will fill the Meades: In stead of prayers, Ile execrate and curse, And to the burthen of myne untun'd shreeks The rocks and caves shall echo to thy name. Pen. But Inachus.â Inach. But when your Chanels swell, You can have dammes and sluces to discharge Superfluous waters, lest your torrents rage; And will you bar the conduits of myne eies To ease the flux of my surcharged heart? My care was, Io, to provide a man To be thine husband; but I now must finde One of the bellowing heard to cal me sonne: To have some pretty infant draw thy brest, But now must some py'de urchin sucke thy teats. But that I am immortall, and the dores And gate to death against me are debar'd, I'de weepe my selfe to nothing, and this Beeing Scatter amongst my flouds, that mixt with them, They might (in lesse than drops) amongst their waves, Convey me to the all-devouring seas, To mix my brine with his, and be so lost; And lost, forgotten: But I am still the same, And Io, I'le still call vpon thy name. Exeunt. Enter Iupiter and Mercury. Iupit. How am I mov'd with Inachus exclaimes? Why are the eares of gods kept open still, But first to heare, then pitty? hast thou not, Mercury, Seene Io's teares? Perceiv'd her scalding sighs, And even thus far heard her suspires and grones, Tortur'd beneath that Neatherd churlish groome, More savage than the beasts he feeds? Merc. I have. Iup. How oft hath she, thinking to heave her hands For divine pitty; when she spy'de her hoofes Cast them to th' earth, with them her head with shame, And bellowing when she would complain her griefe, Started at her owne sound? How oft, when grazing on her fathers banks, (These fruitfull banks on which she vs'd to sport) Offring to drinke, when in his Crystall streams, In which so often she with pride hath lookt, On her white brow, red cheeke, and golden curles: Now when she spies those lips a god hath kist, Stretcht to so vast a widenesse, penthous'd o're With inlarg'd nosthrils; looking on those eyes, (In which 'twas once my sole delight to looke) To see them broad and glaring; her cleare brow Late deckt with shining jewels, prest with hornes. How oft hath she (more frighted than asham'd) Thought, from her selfe, in vaine, to hide her selfe? Merc. This can you see? not study how to helpe? Iup. I do, and will, by thyne aid, Mercury; Hye therefore to the top of Pindus mount, (There Argus keepes his watch) in some disguise; Thy Caduceus and thy wings layd by, Finde with the slave some conference, till by cunning Thou charm'st his waking eies, and being fast, Cut off his head, and with one blow extinguish So many lights at once. Merc. Great Iove I will: But thus condition'd, you will interpose Your awfull power 'twixt me and Iuno's hate. Iupit. Presume th' art safe in vs. Merc. Then Argus dies; One fatal stroke shall shut an hundred eies. Exit. Enter Argus leading Io in an halter. Argus. How dost thou like thyne usage, madam Cow? Your lodging and your dyet? How dost thinke This hempen chaine becomes thee? Will you see Your sweet face in the riuer once againe? Or how doth your faire beastship feele your selfe? Wouldst thou not haue some Bulchin from the herd To physicke thee of this venereall itch? If not, I'le see what Nettles muddy streams, Couch-grasse and weeds, thornes, briers, &amp; flints can do. These failing, here's a goad to prick your sides. If all these medicines will not tame your lust, I'le muster new inventions. Nay, I know You looke for pitty, but it lives not here. In this high watch-tower stand I sentinel, To spy who comes and goes. I am made thy gardian, Ile gard thee both from danger and from rest; 'Twas in thy hearing, Iuno's late behest. Enter Mercury like a yong formal Shepheard. Merc. This shape may prove suspectlesse, and the fittest To cloud a godhead in; my plumed hat And fether'd sandals, by the which I am knowne, I have left at foot of this descending hill: My snaky Rod I have to this sheephooke turn'd. Accommodated thus, to Argus now, Aristors sonne: behooves him keepe good watch, Whom Mercury (Ioves son) intends to catch. But Many-eyes have spy'de me. Arg. How now shepheard, There's none who in that simpl shape or name Needs treason feare. Should any come prepar'd For mischiefe, I have lights about me shine Sufficient to prevent it: but thou seem'st None of such ranke. Come sit by me and talke. Merc. The servant to the great Saturnia Doth me no common grace. Arg. Thou know'st me then? Merc. What shepheard but not only knowes your name, But feares your strength? Arg. Nay sit (by me th'art safe) And tell some pretty tales to make me laugh: I have not long been merry. Merc. First resolve me; Is that faire heifer of some neighbour herd, You drag thus in an halter? Arg. Shee's my charge, A witty Brute, a most ingenious beast, A very apprehensiue Animal, That can do tricks: she hath been taught, I tell thee, To write and reade. Merc. Argus, not possible. Argus. 'Tis as I said before: but having her, Some pretty tale, I prethee. Merc. But what if Some goddesse should live in this shape disguis'd, To whom you are so churlish. I could tell you A story to that end. Arg. Such toyes I love. Merc. Thus the Pierides report: The Gyants Assembled and made war against the gods, Heapt Ossa upon Pelion, Caucasus Vpon Pernassus, Pindus above them; Hill upon mountain, mountain vpon hill, Till they had made a scale that reacht to heaven. The conflict then began: the monstrous Typhon Was Captain of the Gyants: Of the gods Great Iove, Archduke. The Generals met and fought. In briefe (to cut off circumstance) the earth Prevaild 'gainst heauen. The gods are forc't to fly: Iove, chac'd by Typhon into Egypt, chang'd Himselfe into a Ram: Apollo, frighted, Turnes to a Crow, Bacchus into a Goat, Iuno a Cow, Diana to a Cat; Venus into a Fish, and tooke the sea; Mars to a Pigmy, lest he should be knowne: And Mercury, syrnam'd the crafty god, Into a Fox. Arg. A Fox? But I would meet That craft which could beguile Argus bright eyes. Proceed, proceed, good shepheard. Merc. Why may not then Some goddesse be included in this shape? Arg. A goddesse, saist thou? thinke me equall then With one of these huge Gyants, if not greater, That have the power and potencie to leade A god-head in a string. But ha, what musick (Musicke. Was that strooke vp? 'Twas sweet and delicat, Nor have I heard the like. Merc. My fellow shepheards Behinde that rocke (from whence an echo growes) For the more grace have chus'd that place as fittest, Prest to bestow their cunning vpon you, Whom they have heard, much tyr'd with watching long. Arg. And shall we have some merry Madrigall To passe away the time with? Merc. What you please. Arg. I faine would know how first these Pipes came up, That make this dainty musicke? Merc. First from Pan The god of Shepheards. In the memory Of the Nymph Syrinx, Musicke strike and tell, How in th' Arcadian plaines it once befell. Mercuries Song. Sirinx, one of Dian's traine, Hunting with her on the plaine, Arm'd alike with shafts and bow; Each from other would you know? Which from which could not be told, Saue ones was horne, the others gold. Arg. Hey ho; very fine musicke I promise you. Merc. Now it begins to worke. Pan he sees himselfe makes fine, In his cap he pricks a Pine: Now growes carelesse of his heard, Sits by brookes to prune his beard, Meets her, and hath minde to wooe, Much he speakes, and more would doe. Arg. 'Tis pleasing, but it makes me melancholy, And drowsie too withall. Merc. 'Twill do anon. (Aside. Still he profers, she denies; He pursues (for Syrinx flies.) Past her knees her coats vp flew, He would faine see something new: By the leg and thigh he guest (It seemes) the vertue of the rest. Arg. Were it not for my charge I'de take a nap. Merc. This addes wings vnto his pace, The goale for which he is in chace. She addes feathers to her speed; Now it was no more than need. Almost caught, Alas she cries, Some chaste god my shape disguise. Arg. The rest may sleepe secure, so I can keepe But two eyes waking. Merc. Here's a charme for them. LÃ¦don heares, and girts her round, Spies a reed that makes sweet sound: Such is Syrinx. Wondring Pan Puts it to his mouth anon: Yet Syrinx thou art myne he said, And so of her his first pipe made. My charm hath tooke effect; with these thyne eyes Take thy last sleepe, thou hast not one to see; My taske is done, and Io thou now free. (cuts off his head. Exit. Enter Iuno. Iuno. The dying groans of Argus call'd me down, To know what of his lustre is become. What, all extinct? and is no memorie Extant of their knowne brightnesse? hath one night (Whose nature should be to be proud of stars) Shut at one time an hundred? nay at once? Should euery piece of time deprive so many, How shortly would these lights innumerable Be vanisht into nothing? But deare Argus, That all may know thou hadst a louing mistresse, Grieuing thou shouldst thus perish for her sake; And that these eies (now blinde) in after-times May giue a light to perpetuitie, And memorize thy name, thy faith and fall, Thy hundred eyes (who wast for Iuno slain) I will transport into my Peacocks traine; Whilst such a bird hath breeding, and can bee, Her painted feathers shall remember thee. Enter Iupiter and Mercury. Iup. And whilest an heifer graseth on the plaine, Io, her hoofe shall still imprint thy name. My Iuno are we friends? Let her long divorce, My faire intreats, with Inachus exclaimes Invoke thy love and pitty, by my life. Iuno. You vse me like a sister, not a wife, My bed is still so empty. Iup. Now by Styx, An oath no god was ever knowne to breake, Signe her release, she shall hereafter be To Iove as a meere stranger. Iuno. Since by that you sweare, What's past is lost, it cuts off future feare, Saving my quarrell, Mercury, to you. Merc. Madam, I did your seruant no great wrong, Save teaching him to relish a new song. Iuno. Where jars are mediated, vain it were Call injuries in question. As with Iupiter, With you we are atton'd. Iup. Now Mercury, Since Iuno is appeas'd, fetch Io hither, In her owne native beauty, whom we will Restore vnto her father. Merc. Sir I shall. Enter Inachus with the other Riuers, &amp;c. Inach. O Iupiter! Ã´ Iuno! Iup. Inachus, Surcease exclaimes, thy prayers have had accesse, Thy teares been pittied, and thy losse bemoan'd; Argus is slain, and faire Saturnia pleas'd, And Io to her pristine shape restor'd. Enter Mercury with Io. Inach. Thanks you immortall gods. Merc. No sooner was this mighty Queene appeas'd, But the rough haire dropt from her tender skin, Her hornes fell off, her eies appeard to shine In a lesse orbe, her mouth and lips contracted Both into compasse, and their native sweetnesse, Her shoulders are restor'd, fingers and hands; Her parted hoofe diuided into five, Now with two feet contented, for on them She straightway stood erect, and of a Cow, Save whitenesse, nought retaining, and even yet She feares to speake, lest she in stead of words Should bellow forth her minde. Io. Yet will I dare To give my father greeting. Inach. O my childe. Iuno. I am still jealous of that face: What's he That makes but a mean sport of wedlocks breach, But thinkes to violate an oath no sin, Though calling testates all the Stygian gods? Great King and Lord, Brother and Husband too, If I be worthy of those attributes Your self have daignd, and all the gods approve, Grant me a second boon. Iup. For thy remisnesse In Io's late affliction, speake, 'tis granted. Iuno. Then from these fields of Tempe banish her, As far as into Egypt. Inach. From her father? Iup. Be you pleas'd, And Iuno shall, I hope, be satisfied. Io, you shall to Egypt be confin'd, Be that your punishment for Iuno's hate: Which executed you shall taste our love. In Egypt held a goddesse thou shalt be, Ador'd and worshipt in thine heifers shape; Oblations shall be daily offer'd thee, And Incense burnt to thy divinitie, And this for ever. Iuno, in vain you sorrow, Ioves word is past, and cannot be revok'd. And now with this one Maxim we conclude; Where lust is punisht, though the bloud be tainted, It (after such long Penance) may be sainted. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SpÃ¦rchius, a River whose banks were round beset with Poplar trees, and therefore called Popuifer, EnipÅus, Apidanus, Amphisus, and Ãas, &amp;c. only the names of Rivers, whose currents and chanels were famous in those parts of Greece: for your better satisfaction, I refer you to Ovid his Metamorph. lib 1. upon the same argument. Pindus, was a mountaine in Thessaly, sacred to Apollo and the Muses, &amp;c. Hemonian Tempe. Tempe was a pleasant valley flourishing with trees, herbes, and flowers, scituate in Thessaly at the foot of the hill Hemus. It was much celebrated by the Muses, as lying betwixt Ossa and Olympus. The River Peneus, Larisa, and the Ãgean Sea, &amp;c. Naiades, were Nymphs or Fayries of the wells, and fountaines. Pierides, were the Muses, so called from Pierus, or else a mountaine in Greece of that name: this Pierus had nine daughters, who contended with the Muses in singing, and being vanquished by them, were transformed into chattering Pyes: in glory of which victory the Muses would be called by their names. Syrinx, an Arcadian Nymph, who flying from the embraces of Pan, the god of the Shepheards, at her intercession to the gods changed into a Reed, her prayer being to preserve her virginity. Styx, a certaine well in Arcadia, the water of which is so cold and venemous, that whosoever drinketh thereof, immediatly dyeth. It eateth and wasteth yron or brasse, neither can it be contained in any thing, but the hoof of a Mule; some say Alexander the Great was poisoned with the water of this river, by Antipater, at the persuasion of Aristotle, the great Philosopher, and Tutor to Alexander. The Poets feigne it to be a river in hell, and so sacred to the gods, that if any of them sweare by it, and breake his oath, he shall be deprived of his godhead, and drinke no Nectar for an hundred yeares after. Gargarus, so called of Gargarus, the son of Iupiter, it is commonly taken for the top or Apex of the high hill Ida, where the said god had an Altar consecrateunto him, it is situate betwixt the Propontis Abidos, and the Hellespont in Greece, in longitude 55. in latitude 42. It is also a towne under the hill so called. Alcmena, the wife of Amphytrio the Theban, in whose absence Iupiter came in the shape of her husband, comprest her and begot Hercules. Semele, the mother of Bacchus, begot on her by Iupiter, from whence he tooke the denomination of Semeleius. Maia, the daughter of Atlas, and Pleiones, and therefore Atlantiades, of whom Iupiter begot Mercury. By Cadmus faire daughter is intended Semele before spoken of. Moericus, AristÃ¦us, Thrasicles, &amp;c. are names of men whome the Author aimed at (living in those times) according to his fancy. Iapygium, or Iapyges, these derived their names from Iapyx the sonne of Dedalus, and were said to be Cretenses by their originall, and wandring abroad to seeke Colaurus, sonne of Minois, came unto the same place, where after they inhabited, these in time grew to such a profuse riotise, intemperance and wantonnes, that forgetting their Country modesty and honesty, they painted their faces, and wore other folkes haire, and were never seene abroade but sumptuously, and richly appareld; their houses were as beautifull as the Temples of the gods. At length they came to such a height of pride and insolence, that they cast off all religion, entring and seasing on the ornaments, revenues and donaries of the Churches. And at length were all consumed by firy globes falling from heaven, &amp;c. Evphorbus, was a noble Trojane, the sonne of Panthus, who wounded Patroclus, and was after slaine by Achilles, being hurt in the thigh; he was said to have one made him of gold. Pythagoras said, that his soule was in him in that time of the Troian warre, that hee might better perswade his Scholars. Concerning the opinion which he held concerning the transmigration of mens soules, from one body to another. What other difficulties you shall finde in these short Dialogues, you shall find in some or other fully explicated. Cimmerians, were people dwelling in Italy, betweene the BaiÃ¦ and CumÃ¦, so invironed with hills, that the Sunne never appeared unto them, hence came the Proverb TenebrÃ¦ CimmeriÃ¦, the Cimmerian darknesse. Erix, Promontory: Erix was the sonne of Venus, slaine by Hercules, and buried in a mountaine of Cicilia, so called after him, in which place Venus had a Temple erected unto her, and from that she had the denomination of Eriana, &amp;c. Python, was a mighty huge Serpent, which Iuno sent unto Latona when she was with child by Iupiter, to devoure her, but she went to her sister Astrea, who protected her, and she was after delivered of two twins, Apollo and Diana. Endymion, was beloved by the Moone, who courted him upon Latmus hill; and therefore said to looke pale by reason of the great affection which she bore unto him. Tithon, or Tithonus, was the sonne of Laomedon, who desiring long life, was so wasted with old age, that the Poets faigned him to be turned into a Grashopper: he was also said to be beloved of Aurora, the morning; because he used to rise early, which was thought to be the reason why he preserved his life so long.</field>
