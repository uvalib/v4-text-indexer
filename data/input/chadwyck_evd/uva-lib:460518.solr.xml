      <field name="fulltext">GREGORY VII A Tragedy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OH, THAT IT WERE POSSIBLE WE MIGHT BUT HOLD SOME TWO DAYS' CONFERENCE WITH THE DEAD! FROM THEM I SHOULD LEARN SOMEWHAT, I AM SURE, I NEVER SHALL KNOW HERE. WEBSTER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. Hildebrand, a monk, and the son of a carpenter of Soano, in Tuscany, was born A. D. 1013. He raised himself to power in the Church; through his influence successively deposed two Popes, and elected two others; smote the last of these in the face during high Mass, because his Holiness had acknowledged the authority of the Emperor; ascended the Papal chair himself, by forcing his own election; established the supremacy of the Church over all other sovereignties; and created a new system of things, which endured nearly five hundred years after his death. Short of stature, but deep-built as a temple wall, I have supposed Gregory to possess great physical, as well as mental, powers. Of his character and actions, this is not the place to speak. The period of his death is ante-dated by dramatic license, and its circumstances may easily be imagined as coincident with his fall from supreme dominion. Such an end seemed very natural for one who had previously both wielded and directed âthe sword of the Lord and of Gideon,â and who, after the final struggle which terminated his individual powerâalthough it completed, in every sense, his victoryâwith passionate eloquence celebrated Mass for the last time as Pope, while the blood was streaming around. This was, virtually, the scene of his final triumph and death; nor did he actually survive it long. With regard to the historical character of Gregory VII., as well as many of the most important actions and events of his life, historians frequently contradict each other and themselves. According to some writers, he was all devilishness and âblack art;â with others he was a lofty saint; but few of them deny that he was a great man, if not a greater conqueror, in his way, than the Alexanders and CÃ¦sars. The best connected accounts will, however, be found in âThe Life and Pontificate of Gregory VII.,â by Sir Roger Greisley, 1832; ââHistoire des Republiques Italiennes,â by Sismondi;âin Bayle's Dictionary, &amp;c. See also âHistorical development of the German Empire,â by Putter, 1790. Of the death of Pope Alexander by assassination, no proof exists, and the best authorities seem against it. But after being subjected to the indignity of a blow, while in full pontifical state, and then locked up in a cell with orders to fast and pray, any ultimate violence might have been expected from one like Hildebrand, who was waiting for his absence. On the day of Alexander's burial (some say on the day of his death), Hildebrand caused himself to be elected to the pontifical chair. But should my version of the matter be thought to cast an undeserved stain upon the memory of Gregory VII., be it recollected that his were most turbulent times; that frequent insurrections occurred, which were originated, fomented, and headed by the priests opposed to Gregory, and that numbers of priests were killed in various waysâthough it might be invidious, as well as presumptuous, to say how many should be considered as equivalent to a Pope. In short, I am willing to acknowledge the âdark-dealingâ with Alexander as a kind of dramatic concentration of these events. The death of Godfrey, however, seems to have circumstantial evidence of considerable strength. But as for the different versions of an attempt said to have been made by Gregory to destroy the Emperor by causing a great stone to be âso ordered and trimmedâ that it might be dropped upon his head while he was praying before a shrine in the church of Santa Maria, they all appear fabulous. Many more wonderful things of Gregory than this are both gravely and furiously narrated by Cardinal Beno, âarche-priest of cardinals,â and the mad-headed little work was translated and published in the black letter, by âWynkyn de Worde, Flete Street, 1534.â A copy of this is to be found in the British Museum. All the characters in the present tragedy are historical, although nothing is to be discovered in history of some of them beyond their names and the side on which they ranged themselves during the mighty contests between the Papal and Imperial powers. Justice has been morally aimed at for all; and should any reader, learned in their histories, feel disposed to make an exception with reference to certain points in the character, conduct, and assumed fate of the noble and disinterested Matilda, I can only exhort him to a yet more careful consideration of the known circumstances of her life; of the opinions current among her contemporaries; and to make those deductions of the imagination as well as the reason, which such data naturally suggest. Notwithstanding their manifest originality, I should have been glad had the striking situations in this tragedyâI may say this, as they are, for the most part, not my inventionâ been somewhat reduced in number and brilliancy. âWe may not hope from outward forms to win, The passion and the life, whose fountains are within.â But the truth is, that the very nature of the subject rendered much of this imperative as a matter of art, for the just presentation of the given characters and events. Most of the external situations and effects have been selected, moulded, and grouped from historical facts, with such poetical licenses as the general structure of the whole demanded. For very important assistance in the revision of these pages, I have to express myself gratefully indebted to the judgment, refined taste, and kindness of my friends Mr. Leigh Hunt and Mr. John Forster. And now, if it be permissible that one of âmodern earthâ should attempt the expression of primitive feelings, at a period when the world's heart has been declared by certain able and influential writers, to be comparatively exhausted, let it not be thought irreverent to appropriate the uplifting prayer of the old inspired poet, George Chapman,âbearing, as it does, in conclusion, that solemn moral corrective to all boundless aspirations, whether Gregorian or artistical, which terminates the prospect of a few years:â âLoose my working soul! That in her highest pitch she may controul The court of skill; compact of mystery; Wanting but franchisement and memory, To reach all secrets! And he who shewed such great presumption, Is hidden now beneath a little stone!â Hymnus in Noctem.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âCloisters of St. John Lateran. Enter Guido, Centius, and Eberardus. Gui. (to Eberardus). Archdeacon of Rome! Cen. And by a lynx-trap, Wherein he snared a wise and watchful man, Whose face had sharpened with his midnight thoughts. Gui. Archdeacon of Rome, and Abbot of St. Paul! Ebe. This Hildebrand was but a lowly monk, 'T is not long since,âso have I heard, my lords? Cen. Lowly! Ebe. Methinks he 's learned and devout? Gui. Far more ambitious; darkening beneath a cloud Of large designs. You are deceived, my lord. The pious father with the pausing stepâ Once pacing slow through deep dim-lighted walls; A moving image pondering o'er its clayâ Now plants his heel with regular ascent; Not full of grace, but echoing rapidly, As though his war-horse waited at the gate. Ebe. I know him powerful: the present Pope Was by his influence seated in the chair. Gui. In opposition to Rome's highest nobles, Who Cadolaus chose. And wherefore thus Did Hildebrand stretch forth his iron arm? Not from pure love, not from pure reverence For the mild virtues of Pope Alexander, But that he knows him weak, and governs himâ The gilded organ-pipe of his high will. Cen. 'T is strictly true, my lord; and presently Swarth Hildebrand to aged Mantius hiedâ The late Archdeacon of Romeâbeseeching him To rest him from his cares, and in mean time Make him his deputy. Obtaining this, After some pious scruples touching duty, Unto Pope Alexander straight he sped, And blazoning his credentials for the office Rendered by Mantius in full confidence, Swore that his grace was superannuate, Unfit for duty, and should be deposed! Gui. (looking upward). Ay, thus it was: bear witness! Ebe. By such means Hath he obtained this last new dignity? Cen. He hath: be sure of it. He is a man Who drives his conscience like a slave before him, While as a task-master it doth follow others. This gives him vantage ground. Gui. Whereon he wields A scourge that makes the Vatican pavement stones Cry sacrilege and heresy! But full soon, Now that imperial Henry is prepared To leave our church's tutelage, and assume His sceptered rights, this haughty abbot's deeds Shall be made palpable, as will his throes When the red lights of doom shall wanton o'er him! Enter Hildebrand, behind. Ebe. He must be humbled. Cen. 'T were no easy task. Gui. (to Ebe.) Humbled, my lord! degraded utterly! Yes, humbled first, and then cast to the dogs That howl through Rome, filled with his devilishness. Sir, your imperial master must know all. Hil. (coming forward). He shall! Ebe. You have heard serious words, my lord. Cen. Sir, there 's none here who would retract his words. Hil. Why should he?âWhat ye have saidâreferring, doubtless, Unto the late archdeaconâis most true. Old and infirm; incompetent through his cunning, Which riddled policy, 'twas fit he left us. Moreover, of his time he ill disposed: Squared down astrology for private ends, And innovation bred of controversy; Read books of vanities and high romance, Like my lord Guido's âCommentaries.â Gui. How! Profanityârank blasphemy! Ye heard him? Hil. Still, the sometime archdeacon had his virtues. Cen. We spake of the present archdeacon, Hildebrand. Hil. It is the sameâit is the same, my friends, Whate'er ye spake. Gui. (to Ebe.) The placid arrogance! Cen. Think of meek piety; then hear him preach. Ebe. Archdeacon, you lack courtesy. [Organ peals within. Hil. My lords, The mass your souls' devout attendance claims! We bless the Emperor's journey with the day That gives the last tint to his ripened age For temporal government. Firm be his faith! Our prayers he needs; for much, I fear, his sense Hungers for luxury, pomps, and violent wars; Whereto, in all, I judge his nature apt, By the hot humours of his private talk; The sanguine colour baked into his skin; His large, long arms, and his unsettled face; His blood-shot eyes, and lips that seldom close, Gui. This portrait smacks of treason! Hil. Our sovereign lord, The Pontiff, will the homily deliver In person: I exhort ye, come and hearâ (aside) The Pontiff whom I set i'the supreme chair! [Exit. Gui. (to Ebe.) Marked you his action? Cen. Like a machinist, He stalks to hear the creature he hath made. Gui. And calls us to admire the mockery! But come, my lord; we know not what may chance In turbulent times of change. [Exeunt Guido and Eberardus. Cen. Why, that is true; And gross, rank-rooted schemes may be submerged Like oozy weeds in Nile's broad overflow, Whose ebbing waves beckon with glittering joy Fertility's advance. There 's some fresh plot Gathering in Guido's soul; but good hopes oft In good mens' hearts will blossom 'midst all ills; So let the seasons work. Enter Fabio and Tancredi. Tan. I fear we are late. Cen. (aside). Nobles of Guido's party. (Aloud). Why such haste, sirs? Fab. His holiness e'en now performs high mass For the young Emperor. Cen. We are in good time: If not, our absence will disturb no thought. So dense the crowd, I doubt if you'd find room To stick a rapier upright there, unless You sheathed it in the broad back of some monk. Fab. A jest that savours of impiety. Tan. You're pleasant, sir. Cen. A pleasant scene you 've missed. Erewhile, Count Eberardus, with discourse Of lilied fragrance, rich in dazzling terms, Such as an emperor loves, to Guido spake In raptures of his âpoem;â whereupon Guido's bright eyes, small hawk-nose, and fat chin, Shone all a-light with pleasure in extreme, Which suddenly his mounting thoughts inspired Straightway to catch at interest in the church, Right through the scattered muses. Soon he cleared His breast of half its load of Hildebrand; With eloquent denouncement raising oft His heaven-ward hand, to shew his filbert nails And topaz rings, but never losing sight Of Hildebrand. Fab. In which keen work you joined? Cen. Doubtless I did: you know I hate the man. When, all unseen, at height of our discourseâ [Organ peals within. The strain pauses abruptly. Noise, and confused voices. Fab. What may this mean? Tan. Hath the church taken fire? Cen. I heard the voice of Hildebrand! [Increased noise within. Enter hurriedly, Guido, Eberardus, Brazute, and several Nobles. Gui. Shame! shame! Oh, frightful violenceâprofane and brutishâ It pinnacles all crimes, all thought outshoots, Touching God's footstool with a sharp assault! Fab., Tan. What is 't?âwhat is 't? Cen. Nay, gentlemen; explain! Gui. Who shall set forth the deed; Who give a shaping language to its bulk! Far as mere words can tellâstay, give me breath!â To the hushed multitude, Pope Alexander Discoursing solemnly, and pouring forth Paternal hopes, yet duteous love, for Henry, Avowed he would not hold pontifical power, Save with full sanction from the Emperor's throne. From his high place the holy man came down, But while descending, Hildebrand, with eyes Like to a demon, met him on the stairs, And shouting âDotard!â smote him in the face With hand as heavy as a lion's paw, And seemed prepared to rend him! All. Monstrous deed! [Increased noise and confusion within. Enter hurriedly, a crowd of Nobles, Cardinals, Bishops, and Monks; followed by Hildebrand, with outspread arms. Hil. Form no decision; hear me first I say! Form no decision; fie on irrational tongues, And hasty judgments; noise and blind reproof! Are ye a deafening land-storm wildly raging, And would ye tear the sheltering forest down? Trust not yourselves upon a barren heath; Trust not the Emperor's frail and worldly strength; Look to the See of Rome! but look ye well That giant-power be emblemed by a giant, Not by a yeanling lamb. Oh, sons of Romeâ Nobles and dignitaries of the churchâ Pardon me! pardon me a fatal actâ I mean the ignorance of erring choiceâ I mean the choice of weakness 'stead of strengthâ I mean the installation of Pope Alexander. Lo! he hath perilled all your rights and power; Your fortunes, and the purity of your faith; The very stature of the pontifical office. Behold, the corner stone o' the Vatican Trembled! I rushed to save it from the crash, And in the doing did forget myself In acting for the safety of us all. Pope Alexander I pronounce a worm! Ye must not let him teach us how to crawl Before an emperor's footstool: rather say He shall be cast down from the Pontiff's seat, Whereon my ignorance besought ye place him! [Murmurs of dissatisfaction, and applause. Braz. It shall be done! Tan. Who tells thee so, lord Cardinal? 1st Car. My lord Archdeacon speaks with reason. Cen. With reason! Gui. No; with madness! with ambition! Hil. Shall I set you in his place? 2nd Car. The Pope's vicegerency is given by God. Fab. Hear my lord Cardinal! 2nd Car. 'T is our great law! 1st Car. Let 's to the Council! Voices. To the Council! Hil. Oh, most humblyâto the council! Gui. Proud Abbot of St. Paul, and Rome's Archdeacon, Have a care! Hil. To the Council, my Lord Archbishop! I will have care, and you shall thank me for it: Most humblyâto the Councilâto the Council! [Exeunt. SCENE II. âGrand Front of St. John Lateran. Enter the Countess Matilda and Godfrey. Godf. His mine is sprung, and into pestilent air He has blown himself. Mat. We must be calm, and wait. Godf. Calm! is it possible? Mat. 'T is only just. Godf. Seest not thine error yet?âseest not, Matilda, This object whom thou 'st long beheld with thoughts Devout, that mingled in thine orisons, Is fraught with worldliness; one who, beneath The shaded haunts of sanctity, conceals Passions like dragons, violent and foul. Mat. He has, indeed, Such strength of passion as assorts with greatness Of thought and action; yet, my lord, believe, Though he may err, as in this act he has, In Hildebrand is nothing base or mean. And let me tell thee, husband, I believe There may be reason, when we shall know all, In that which seemed so mad. Godf. Matilda, cease! Infatuated woman! cast away The film that, like a cowl, doth blind thine eyes: Dismiss this vicious abbot from thy prayers; Confess not to him: of thy love I ask it;â Nay, of thy holiest faith. Oh, wouldst thou gaze At heaven's clear sapphire through the gates of hell? Mat. My lord! forbear these impiousâ Godf. Forbear thou! I will not listen to this vain defence Of such a criminal. [Exit Godfrey. Mat. This headstrong hate I fear will snap all ties. Enter Hildebrand. What hast thou done? Hil. Well; very well. Mat. Resolve me of all doubt! Hil. 'T was impulse from on high, not my design. Daughter, they rolled before me like a sea; Then paused to let me walk upon their necks, As foamy as they were,âI was upheld By the deputed fire that wings my soul. The council has concluded as I wished; And thus the mutinous churchmen are put down. I left them when I saw 'twas working right; For I can stand alone, therefore have friends. Mat. Why didst thou smite the PontiffâOh, why didst? Hil. Because his weak-souled loyalty to Henry Smote like an axe against the See of Rome. I heard Time's echoes through the world's forest ringing; I saw the tree which should o'ertop them all, Like to a sun-beam falling into night, And therefore stood I forth and smote that man, As I will take the axe from out his hand. Mat. Father, enough: I do believe thy truth Equals thy courage in this lofty cause. I much lament thou hast an enemy In Godfrey, who proclaims thee full of evil, And worldliness and vice. Hil. His proclamation Is as a plague-wind howling through a hall, Throng'd with grey statues of the elder gods. Its breath can never taint me: let it proclaim! There is no vice can dwell in a soul of power: It may appear in transitory fits; But, like blear lightning at the pitch of noon, It leaves no flaw in heaven. Poisonous dews Are presently o'ermastered by the sun, Which sucks them up, but of their influence Partaking nought, absorbs and turns to good. Mat. Most gladly, most devoutly do I hear thee; And do again surrender my whole soul To thy paternal charge. Hil. Daughter, 'tis well. High thrones have need of thee; and most of all, Pontifical Rome, in dire emergency, Looks for thine utmost aid. Mat. It shall be given:â But what the threatened peril? Hil. Loss of power; And that comprises every loss: drain ocean Of her world-swinging waves, then may her bed Serve to herd cattle in, safe from all storms, And browsing fat amid the fossil shapes. Shall low desires of animal life possess Our measureless realm, stupendous e'en in death, And our lost glories give them food and shade! Oh, daughter! it is granted thee of heaven This peril to avert. The Tuscan army, Obedient to thy call, must hither speed; And secretly arriving in the night, Soon as the Emperor hath departed hence, May enter suddenly the gates of Rome To act as I direct. Mat. What then? Oh, father! let no blood be spilt in this. Hil. None need, nor shall, unless of those who 're mad, And run upon the spears. Mal. I am content. Hil. All the strong posts in Rome I'd have thee guard; And to what end I will in brief explain. [Exeunt. Enter Godfrey and Guido. Godf. Have I not cause, my lord? Gui. You haveâyou have! My lord duke, listen to me: 'tis the etherialâ The etherial you should study. Godf. School you a heart Amid its anguish with a churchman's dreams! Know'st thou my soul? what think'st thou of its thrall? Gui. Thy noble lady's loyalty to thee Sinks all absorbed in his insidious wiles. Godf. Her loyalty and loveâall thoughts and hopes! Oh, my lord archbishop, into thine ear I fain would pour my double source of grief; For while Matilda on the ghostly breastâ The devilish breastâof Hildebrand reclines, And follows all the counsels he instils, The Emperor lingers ever in her path, And feeds upon her beauty with his eyes.â Hast not observed it? Gui. Never. But, if true, Wer't not a meansâa fortunate meansâto turn The Emperor 'gainst this abbot, whom we hate? Godf. Call you it fortunate? Is there no word That to the mind shall paint a hideous thought Blacker than blackness;âno revolting act That, o' the instant it first stings the brain, Shall brand the forehead? If that such there be, Or word or act, call it a fortunate means For sure perdition of high manhood here, With flames hereafter. Shame on thee, my lord! Thy sacred robes change colour as I gaze, And startle apprehension! I had hoped Far different consolation and advice: But I will fly the hated city walls, And trust the day not distant when I'll find A means which honour's hand shall proudly own, And vengeance feel complete! [Exit. Gui. Vengeance on whom? The Emperor, or that abbot?ânot on me. So angry! I was unguardedâperhaps even wrong. Hildebrand moves Matilda to this passâ Whether she know it or not, I see 't is doneâ That Godfrey, jealous of the Emperor's sighs, May take no part with him. I do dissect This truth like a burnt ortolan. Enter the Emperor, with Eberardus, and suite. Pure breezes And temperate suns attend your majesty, Unto the foot-stool o' the Germanic throne! Do you set out to day? Emp. My lord, we do. Ebe. But of this headstrong Abbot Hildebrand,â Emp. Now spare us, sir! no more of Hildebrand: We shall erewhile appoint another Pontiff In Alexander's place; one who shall keep All froward churchmen in becoming check. Gui. Therein your majesty will render service Of deepest import to the peace of Rome. Emp. (to Ebe.) Your ear, sir! My message to the Countess of Tuscanyâ Ebe. Was duly given. Emp. (aside). Where'er I walk my spirit is possessed With ravishing desire, which ever sees Matilda's near, yet still receding form. Her large clear eyes are full of azure light; Her breath of balmy prayer; and her tall shape, Is by its beauty softened like a dream. How shall I compass so much love and dread? The angel and the woman hold my will Balanced with fear of heaven. Hist! she comes. Enter Matilda, attended. Emp. Ah! noble princess, rich in southern skies, And teeming fields, more rich in subject hearts, Accept our farewell homage, and permit A hope to beam that not all unregretted, Nor soon forgotten, shall we hence depart. Mat. The Majesty of Germany doth bear His own beams round about his brows, nor needs To ask for aught to light his hopes. Emp. Is 't so? Now could I cast my throne into the sea, And plant my sceptre in the quiet soil, To stand amidst the vivid summer buds! Why must I journey hence? Mat. Oh, royal sir! Duty, imperious as the sway you bear, Calls from your realms. Emp. Yet do you see me, lady, Like to a magic arrow from the clouds, Fixed trembling here. Gui. (aside). Bright, sensitive,âand pointed. Mat. What should we say, If that the sun enamoured of the stars, Unto night's palace did all day resort; His radiant diadem in shades absorbed; And while he slept with sphered music tranced, His mortal creatures languished in the dark, And maddened at the apparent end of time? Oh, royal sir, the hour of dawn glides by, While thou, but on the threshold of intent, Stand'st shining at the gates. God speed you, sir! Emp. I cannot, will not hence depart, until Thy promise I obtain. The German court Shall wait thy presence ere one festive day Our advent clarion. Thou wilt visit us! Gui. (aside). Godfrey hath reason for his jealous fear; And yet I doubt the event. Mat. Imperial Henry! Myself, and Godfrey will attend your pleasure. Gui. (aside). Godfrey 's misled: there 's nought to fear in this. Emp. Thyself; none else can live within my thoughts. Mat. Ah, speak not thus: in Rome are many things That claim devout and deepest thought. Emp. What mean you? Mat. I mean the safety of the See of Rome, Its faith, and those who represent its power: Oh, fill thy thoughts with visions such as these! And in especial would I name to thee, As one deserving reverent confidence, The learned Abbot Hildebrand. Gui. Ahem! Emp. Whom say'st thou? Oh, I have heard and know enough of him: We'll bear him well in mindâthe learned monk.â When shall our court behold thee, and be blest? Mat. As thou dost hold the grace of highest heaven, And of the church, my prayers shall follow thee: And to thy court some brief space will I come, As I shall find thine ardent soul waft back The measure of its faith towards templed Rome. Emp. Now, by my sword and its high warlike hopes, All faith, all feeling shall return to thee! Such be our bond: Matilda, fare thee well! [Exeunt Emperor, Eberardus, Guido, and suite. Mat. He darkened o'er the name of Hildebrand.â Whate'er his bent, I will at once secure The safety of the papal power, and plant The Tuscan troops where they may best defend Our purpose; then, if vast designs take root, Build up a throne upon the thrones of kings. [Exit. SCENE III. âA Cell in the Monastery of St. Paul. Table and lamp, with skull and crucifix. Enter Hildebrand. Hil. Portentous changes wrestle in the air! I see, methinks, a mighty shadow fall, While solid pillars lift a solid throne, Which in fixed radiance stands. Strong deeds awake, And clamouring throng the portals of the hour. Weak-minded Alexander thou must die! I placed thee on a tower, and thou didst offer A king the pass-key to our wall of strength; Therefore 't is good thou diest. Plead not, my soul! The wheels of destiny pass o'er his corse. There 's much to do. The time for me is ripe: It was not wise till now that I should take The sphere which long hath rolled before my grasp, Swimming and heaving in the etherial space; But, with contentious and eruptive fires, Threatening precipitate sovereignty. Who 's there? Enter Damianus. (Aside). He has been listening at the doorâdull fool! (Aloud). There 's much to do. Dami. I feel it in the air With every respiration. Hil. Why comest here At such an hour? Dami. Lord Abbot, I would ask What should be done, touching Pope Alexander? Hil. Nothing. He 's very safe. Dami. Safe in the dark cell where your orders thrust him. Hil. I know it. Dami. But what next, for he is old, And needeth comfort in imprisonment. Hil. Do nothing. Leave him. Dami. His cell is very damp, and cold dews trickle Down his grey head and beard, as bowed he sits, Counting his beads. Beseech you, good lord abbot, Change his sad dwelling! Hil. Let him take his shroud, And finish it i'the antechamber! Dami. But, my lord, Howâhow shall we answer this? Hil. Answer it! Who shall presume to gall and question us? Who make us constantly responsibleâ Who 'd force us answer, but this Alexanderâ Therefore death's scythe shall give him sweeping thanks. Dami. And for his service and his burialâ Hil. Let him have Night and Silence! A century hence, When a few dust-filled bones perchance are found, 'T will shew that somebody died there. For the rest, I know my âanswer,â let those ask who may: Mention his name no more, for he has passed! Dami. My lord, good night:âa deep good night, I pray! [Exeunt, at opposite sides. SCENE IV. âFront of the Vatican. Castle of St. Angelo in the distance. Sunrise. Enter Centius. Cen. I've seen the sun rise now these thirty years, And scarcely missed a morning. Ye blest saints! Low in the grave I'd lay my satisfied head Could I behold the popular cause advance With steps as regular and full of light. On one side Hildebrand seeks to destroy All liberty of conscience: with like zeal Our nobles grasp at every rood of earth; And knowing the rich vein of labour's ore, Would turn their fellow creatures into coin. Hence, they hate Hildebrand, who'd act their part, And wield, besides, high sacerdotal power; But whether in return, he most doth hate, Or fear, or scorn, soon must events give proof. Enter Guido, slowly. Gravely you read the earth, and seem with each step To turn a fresh page! Gui. Each far worse than the lastâ But the same subject. Cen. It must be a dark one; Yet with some fascination? Gui. It is a dark one. Last night I went forth for a lonely walk, And paused in front o'the monastery of St. Paul. I know not why, nor what had led me thither: I stood among the dark-mossed uncouth trees, Which rose against the cold and breathless sky Like sculptured gods of Babylon's early youth; And thought that one a rugged outline bore, Like unto Hildebrandâso dense and still. Sometimes at massâsometimes alone in the cloistersâ Sometimes i'the streetâhe stands just in that way. Cen. But what of this?âwhy do you look so pale, And gaze around? what is 't that moves you thus? Gui. Sudden presentiments that forestall wisdom With most unreasonable fact. Cen. My lord! Sure this is weaknessâbut your tale 's not done? Gui. It is not. Cen. Nay, proceed. Gui. Wild and abrupt The wind rose, like a dragon lashing about, And o'er the northern wall, ere I could turn, A vulture 'gainst the high blast beat its way With clanging power, and passing o'er my head Sent forth a cry that pierced into my soulâ Enter Fabio hastily. What wouldst thou say? Fab. Pope Alexander 's dead! Gui. See there! see there! I felt it would be so Cen. How deadâhow died he? Answer us at once Fab. Nay, sir, I do not know. Gui. He hath been murdered! In St. Paul's monastery he was held close, Pending the recent council, and therein He hath been foully dealt with! Fab. Foully indeed. Cen. (aside). What follows this?âI will away to learn. [Exit. Enter three Cardinals, followed by several Abbots and Monks, in alarm. Gui. Now, now! 1st Car. Oh, my lord Guido! Gui. Is the news true? 1st Car. We come but now from viewing His pale remains within the monastery. Gui. Where, then, is Hildebrand? 1st Car. He 's gone; and no one Knows whither. Gui. Gone!âfled? 1st Car. He must be found anon. Fab. Saw ye no blood upon the reverend form? Gui. There 's not a moment to waste! Lords, Cardinals, And all you heads and dignitaries of the church, Full synod let us straight convoke, to search The hideous truth out; retribution hurl Upon the soul of guilt; and fix with whom The future power be vested. [Music outside, as of a distant march. Fab. What 's that? Gui. It sounds like a march! 1st Car. Without delay, Let 's to full conclave at St. John Lateran. [March approaching. Enter Centius and Tancredi, followed by several Monks. Gui. What is 't, my lords? Cen. You will know soon enough, Gui. Speak, brothers! 1st Monk. Soldiers, at St. John Lateran, Have taken up their post, and guard the gates! [March advances. Enter, slowly, an Officer, at the head of troops. They march across, and exit. Enter the Countess Matilda and Cardinal Brazute, between two Officers, heading troops, which range themselves in front of the Vatican. Gui. Daughter of Tuscany!âillustrious lady! What wouldst thou do? Mat. Secure the Vatican, Even as now St. John's gates have been guarded. Gui. Secure! Mat. Would ye know more, my lords? Those troops which have passed on, proceed to occupy The Castle of St. Angelo on the rock. Gui. Oh, wherefore this? Mat. Because the Pontiff 's dead. Gui. We know it, madam, and have convoked a synod; But why these troops? Mat. To Alexander's seat There must be a successor. 1st Car. We shall choose one. Mat. You 're spared that trouble; the successor 's chosen. Gui. Chosen! [Distant march. Troops are seen to mount guard at the Castle of St. Angelo on the rock. Voices. Vivat sanctus Pater Gregorius Septimus! [Applause and loud murmurs. Braz. Vivat! Enter Hildebrand. Hil. Peace! Let tumultuous tongues be mute: I do submit me to the elective voice. [Shouts. Cen. (to Gui.) He may submit his neck unto the block As suddenly, ere long. Gui. (aside). I am all air! [Exeunt. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âApartment in a Palace near Rome. Enter Godfrey. Godf. Are these the men who babble of the spheres, And while they point to the vast frame of heaven, Make it the looking-glass of their self-love, Which virtue stamps to atoms?âwhich a child, In the simplicity of strength can search With the first pebble of its upward thought, As David brained the giant?âthese the men, Who for our common frailty intercede, Being themselves all purity and truth! Oh, counterfeit of goodness! get ye hence, Lest we the cloven footmarks of your way Identify, and turn our prayers to whips. HildebrandâGregoryâmost potent cheat! Here will I frame my net of iron meshes; And though it cost me years to compass theeâ [Clarion sounds outside. Who comes? Enter an Attendant. Att. Count Eberardus, please you, my lord. Godf. From Germany direct? Att. My lord, I think so. Godf. Say, I wait his pleasure. [Exit Attendant. What can portend This journey and this visit?ânot my wife? Doth, then, the Emperor tire of wanton wars, And turns he now again his salient bow, Hot-headed arrows of loose hopes to wing 'Gainst one already in benighted ways, Lost to all love and truth! Enter Eberardus. Ebe. How fares Duke Godfrey? Godf. Sir, well enough, I thank you. Ebe. Well enough! Godf. Will you advise me of your business, sir? For, to be plain, I do not like your master; And it may be that I shall like your errand As little. Ebe. This is strange, sir! How should the Emperor Give pain to you in sending me to hold A serious conference with youâor your ladyâ If it be that you hint at? Godf. That I hint at! Oh, how much more! for 'tis impossible A sober thought should measure his wild will. Why should this touch me, do you ask, my lord? And wonder as you ask;âlifting your eyebrows; Putting one palm forth with a reasoning air Of mild appeal, your attitude presenting The most surprised and moderate man in the world? Sir, it does touch meânearly. You are a courtier, And love your master, as all courtiers have done Since osier crowns were woven in old woods: But, whatsoe'er your loyalty or skill, Your mission here I shall turn inside out, Baring his purpose to contempt, which thus, With all due ceremony, you shall take back. Ebe. My lord, I've borne your temper patiently, But you rush through all bounds; and much I fear Your high nobility you set at stake, In losing courtliness. What mission, think you,â What purpose brings me hither? Godf. Purest virtue. Know you the Emperor hath seen Matilda? Hath spoken with her, also? You forget it? Perhaps, you never knew it? Hast not heard That the damned Gregory hath ratified Matilda's separation? Ebe. You are too hasty, sir; Blind jealousy misleads you. I am sped Towards Rome; and pause to tell you that I bear Dispatches from the Emperor touching Gregory. Godf. Gregory? Ebe. Ay, Hildebrand: call him as ye may. Godf. Gregory! To what purport? to invest him With further territories; to assist With armies and with money; to exhort All Italy to worship?â Ebe. To depose him! Godf. Him! Gregory! Depose Gregory, do you say? Ebe. I do. Godf. Imperial Henry hath a noble spirit.â Why, this is news!âAnd, courteous lord, forgive My ill reception of you; well you know That I have cause for much disquietude.â But how is this, and when shall it be done? Ebe. Forthwith. Godf. How? When? Ebe. My lord, the occasion Is fixed, albeit the Emperor doth command My secrecy therein. Godf. Well, sir; 'tis well. I will accompany you, and lend all aid Within my scope to render his disgrace A terror and a warning. Ebe. Sir, I thank you: And 't was the Emperor's wish you should be there. Godf. My wish, no less. Now, Gregory! thy power Rocks to its base, and it shall strew the plain In fragments ghastly as a murderer's dreams. O, sir! you chase the shadows from my soulâ You light my path with fire! Let us away! [Exeunt. SCENE II. âPalace of the Countess Matilda, in Rome. Enter Matilda, with a letter. Mat. The Emperor's mother favouring Gregory, Is a brave sound to go forth to the world. The Dowager Empress, then, hath deeply felt My late appeal. (Reads). âI shall attend your summons instantly; And doubt not I may reach you ere my letter.â What if she change her mind?âit 's possible. I shall not changeârather increase my efforts. Devotion, doubled now, claims acts with thoughts, For I am all involved. What hurrying stepâ Enter the Empress Agnes. The Dowager Empress! Madam, my arms rejoice To hold you thus! but wherefore this disguise? Agn. In haste I left the imperial court, much fearing Detention through delay: e'en while I speak, Count Eberardus may have entered Rome, To publish the decree. Mat. He dare not do it. Agn. Oh, I had hoped young Henry had not dared. Bethink you, madam, how't must wring my heart, To find myself the opponent of my son! Mat. I have thought of it; and do honour you, Imperial lady, for your constancy Unto the Vatican. The struggle 's hard; But therein do you shew yourself more strong, Pure, and devout: and, truly, is it not Most wise maternity to check a son Who rushes towards a pitfall?âpray you speak! Agn. It is my best belief, my strong support. Mat. 'T was rumoured here that, flushed with wine, he claimed To nominate the hierarchy of Rome! The which when Gregory heard, he straightway wrote, And bade the Emperor think no more of it. Now comes this Eberardus to reply, The Emperor doth depose his Holiness, Wishing a more obsequious church! Agn. Oh, madam! This is, indeed, too true; and I do feel That, by a hand of powerâ Mat. Should be withdrawn His sceptreâfor a time? Agn. Should this be done? O, God! Mat. It shouldâit must! Call you to mind his inexperienceâ His dangerous passions; and at once resolve To save him by a well-timed, strong reproof! Agn. I am resolved. Mat. The Saints speak in you, madam! Submission must be taught himâhow to stoop, And bow to the triple-crown of the Vatican. [Exeunt. SCENE III. âCorridor in the Tower of Centius in Rome. Folding doors at the back. Knocking outside. Enter Centius, closing the doors behind him. Cen. Open the gates whoe'er the man may be. Nayâstop! Since that I have a place of strength, It were as well to choose my visitors. Enter an Attendant. Att. This ring, my lord. Cen. Admit the applicant. [Exit Attendant. 'T is Godfrey!âsure this bodes us something good: A strong ally. Enter Godfrey. My lord, you 're welcome here. Godf. Thanks, noble Centius: come I not in time? Cen. You find the city in some trouble, sir. (Aside). In time!â [Looking towards the folding doors. Godf. With greater troubles pending. Cen. Do you think so? Godf. I do, and think they may be forthright ended By one sure blow. Cen. Ah! I would gladly see it! Godf. And aid it, wouldst not? Cen. With my soul I would. Godf. And I with my sword!âCurses on Gregory! Cen. I say so too. Godf. And on the Emperor. Cen. Of that hereafter; but the matter in hand Is Gregory's deposition. I perceive You know of this. Godf. And therefore came I here. Cen. We 'll set our shoulders to his downward wheel! His fall is compassedâand, to make it sure, I have some friends here, you shall look upon. [Centius opens the folding doors. Enter Guido, Fabio, and Tancredi. Godf. I do rejoice to meet such friends, and feel The strength of a united purpose. Centius! My life for Gregory's death! Cen. His death, my lord? His deposition and discomfiture, Perchance his banishmentâthat did we wish;â But for his death? Gui. It were the safest measure. Cen. Do you advise it? Gui. Albeit, I would not That ye should kill him. Fab. 'T were a dangerous task. Cen. And difficult withal. Godf. Not dangerous, nor difficult! mark me well: I have forecast the means. Cen. So promptâproceed, sir. Godf. (laying his hand on his breast). I will not speak to ye of my wounds here, And why I seek his life. Gui. Oh, you have cause, Most bitter cause, my lord. Godf. This I'll pass over. At the Grand Conclave, when in pontifical state, Uttering his brazen fiats, Gregory sits, My emissary shall forthwith appear And lure him to our grasp: then while he sits On his coiled chains with clenched teeth, Eberardus With safety may proclaim his deposition. Thus will the fresh-pierced veins of his disgrace Give colour to his sudden taking off, (aside to Cen.) And seem the Emperor's will. Cen. Nay, but that 's good. Gui. (aside). Would it were done! I see him manacled! I see him dungeoned, while the inward throes Draw square his nether jaw, and his fierce thoughts Shake his large shadow on the lamp-lit wall! (Aloud). But how effectedâif it needs must be? Cen. My lords, we are too hasty: first secure And bring him hitherâthen decide his fate. Tan. Ay, that 's the best, and now the meansâthe means? Godf. He must be bidden to a lonely palace, By urgent message of some embassy From foreign powers on secret policies. Cen. He will not go: he will command them straight Into his presence. Fab. What if your noble lady Were feigned to send? Godf. My lord!âWe met as friends. Were he worse devil, and worse enemy, And that I hated him a thousand fold, I would notâpardon meâwe 're wasting timeâ Say, shall we tell him that some dying noble, Some aged prince, craves help and consolation In his last moments from the Pontiff's presence? Gui. And add, be sure, this aged prince bequeaths Unto the pastoral care of Gregory, His sunny lands with all the flocks upon them; Else, he 'll not move. Cen. Lord Guido's dulcimer, Methinks will charm the shepherd from his fold. Gui. Ay, ay; ye 'll find I read him very close: The man is not profound. His present power Grew from no real orthodox eloquence: He owes it all to his Memnonian voice! He has no genius. Cen. But he has strong friends. Gui. Alas! that 's true. Godf. And enemies. Gui. Still, 't is true: And most of all I fear the Greek-god head, And stony eye of Cardinal Brazute. Howbeit the cunning toils are most my trust, Framed out of hearing. Cen. (deliberating). 'T is a feasible schemeâ The sunny lands and flocksâit may be done. Godf. I 'll answer for the rest: lands he shall haveâ The widestâthose that stretch beyond the graveâ And, be the records of his crimes, his flocks, While wolves in darkness howl his monody! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. âGrand Conclave, lighted with splendour. Gregory, seated as Pontiff, surrounded by Ambassadors, Cardinals, Nobles, the Empress Agnes, the Countess Matilda, Brazute, Damianus, &amp;c. Gre. I claim the empire of the West: and, claiming, The cities and the people bow assent. Into the bosom of light, as to its source, Were nations conscious of their best behoofâ Would all authority be gladly poured; But since mankind do need a helping hand, It is the province of paternal sway To lift them from blind earth, and place with care I'the sanctuary of peace. We live in a time When lion-mouthed war with brutalised force prevails, And monarchs bathe in most abhorrent glory: The which, not sanctioningâbut from my soul Loathed as man's self-made pestilenceâI denounce. Take up the world in your hand, and look at it! You see on one side sworded kingsâon the other, Our lofty ordinances! Here are two powers: Christ's mission, and man's swordâye are to choose. Clear are my words, and palpable to sense As yon high crucifix! Wherefore, 'tis good, Most just, and dutiful, ourselves to range 'Neath heaven's white banner, and take special charge Of all that lives and moves. It is not muchâ My childrenâ'tis not much. What embassies Are here assembled? Amb. of France (rising). On the part of France In your Supremacy's presence I appear To offer reverence and gratulation, From our loved king, who, in his people's name, Vouches all fealty and devout regard. Gre. 'T is well: bid him remember! Amb. of Venice (rising). From the Doge Of Venice, may it please your Holiness, I bring most humble tribute of all duty, And deep assurances of stedfast love. Gre. Bid thou the Doge thy master to repent His manifold vices, lest we turn our back, And darken supplication. I am advised That Geisa, King of Hungary, and the Princes Of Capua and Beneventum, swear All fealty. Enter an Officer. Off. Craving audience straight, Lanfranc from England, greets your Eminence. Gre. (after a pause). Admit him! [Exit Officer. (Aside). He hath pitched his tone full high. Enter Lanfranc. Lanf. William of England, surnamed the Conqueror, Sends friendly greetings towards the Vatican; Offering his duty to the Roman See, And unto Gregory his mailed hand. Gre. (to Mat.) This Norman woodcutter must be endured; He may be over-strong for our reproof. (Aloud). We take his hand; and herewith ratify His royal claim unto the throne he holds. Enter an Officer. Speak! (after a pause). Why, speak! Off. Yourâfrom Germanyâsupremeâ Gre. Who comes from Germany? Off. Count Eberardus. Gre. Well, on what?âtake that trembler from our presence, And send the other in. [Exit Officer, accompanied. Mat. (aside to Agnes). Madam, be firm! Enter Eberardus. He advances to the centre. Enter Godfrey, Centius, and Guido; who stand aside. Gre. Big with what errand come you, sir, to Rome Thus suddenly; and, lacking reverence, Usher yourself, all unapprised, before us? I trust your royal master doth preserve His soul's health with his body's? Ebe. Hildebrand! [Loud murmur, ending abruptly in silence. Godf. (aside). Oh, this is premature! Would he had waited! Ebe. Thus in full conclave am I bade to speak, By our imperial sovereign, Henry! Gre. Speak, then, for your sovereign. Ebe. Hildebrand! Self-styled and self-created Roman Pontiff, With titles, revenues, authorities, As Gregory the Seventhâdown from thy chair Descend! Put off thy triple crown! and know, Imperial Henry sanction doth refuse To thy election, and deposes thee! [The whole Assembly rise. Braz. (calmly). Shall the rocks fear the shipwreck? A Car. Strike him down, Low on his knees! Voices. Down! down! [Cardinals and Nobles rush towards Eberardus. Gregory descends, and interposes. Gre. Forbear! stand back! A more becoming answer Should Gregory make. (To Agnes). Madam, do you know this gentleman? Agn. (with scorn). I do: he is the valet of my son. Ebe. The Empress Dowager! [Gregory resumes his throne. Agn. Ay, sir; and hither I came to raise my voice against the crime Of my son's impious message to the Pontiff. Ebe. Could it be thought! Gre. (solemnly). Return to Germany! And bear my mandate to the Emperor, That he should straightway from his throne descend; Put off his crown, and fill it full of dust, Which sprinkling on his head, let him repeat His words to me, applying them to himself. Clad in the garment of supernal wrath, An impious creature visiting, I take Health from his body; from his limbs and thews, The life elastic; with his fluent blood A sluggish vapour mingle; and i'the face Of the last frantic hope that rushes out From the fierce-flaming prison of his soul, The gates of Mercy close in thunder! [Rises with extended arms thrown forward. Behold! He is deposed, and excommunicated! Voices. Away! [Eberardus is hurried out. Cen. (to Godf.) Must it end thus! What 's to be done? Godf. (to Cen.) 'S death! but 't is plain, despite all secrecy, That Gregory was prepared. Cen. (to Godf.) Then we are foiled! Godf. (to Cen.) Not foiled!âit shall not be!âmy plan still holds, And tenfold reason for its execution. See! 't is my emissary! Gre. Dismiss the Conclave! [Descends from his throne. Exeunt Nobles, Cardinals, Agnes, Matilda, &amp;c. Enter a Major-Domo, meeting Gregory. M.-Do. With profound reverence I approach the feet Of Sanctity, and present my master's duty! [Kneels. Gre. Well?â Who is he? M.-Do. The aged Prince of Beneventum. Gre. Well? M.-Do. He has but now arrived in Rome, and lies On his death-bed. Gre. And what is this to me? Can I give him back his youth?âcan I stop him, Does he think? M.-Do. He would unburden, ere he passes, His soul of all its loads; and thereunto His vast possessions add most grievous weight, Not knowing how he should bestow them bestâ But seeking your advice. Gre. Oh!âhe shall have it. M.-Do. Beseech your Sovereign Holiness lose no time! Gre. Lead me to where he lies. [Exeunt Gregory and the Major-Domo. Gui. Said I not well? All merciful Heaven, thy servant's thanks receive! Godf. Stalk to thy dungeon! Gui. Hist! hist! Cen. Follow now! [Exeunt cautiously after Gregory. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA spacious Apartment in an ancient Palace. The pretended Prince of Beneventum is discovered at the further end, upon a Couch, enveloped in an embroidered coverlid. Enter Gregory with the Major-Domo. Gre. He hath not dwelt within this palace long? M.-Do. But a few days, so please your Holiness. Gre. And came he hither sick? M.-Do. Great sir! he did. Gre. (abstractedly). It was a noble edifice,âbut methinks An air of strangeness now pervades the walls; A silent, yet a busy brooding air, As of a spirit clinging to its clay, Which rots e'en while 'tis grasped. Let all things rot When they have stood their time!âthus power and fame, Possessions manifold and large respect, With wise corruption are made ripe to fall Into progressive reproducing hands. Yonder he lies!âThink you his death-hour near? M.-Do. We think it is, dread sir! he cannot sleep, But hath deep trances. Gre. So: announce me to him. [The Major-Domo moves towards the Couch. M.-Do. His Holiness approaches, honoured Prince. Prin. (faintly). I thank his gracious kindness. Leave the chamber. [Exit Major-Domo. Gre. (aside). How changed his voice since last I heard him speak! (Advancing a few paces). How farest good Prince?âHath age with moss and weed O'ergrown the movements of life's radiant wheel; Or doth moist sickness prematurely sap Thy grey tower's dignity? Prin. (feebly). Come near my couch. Gre. (advancing after a pause). Into the terrors of a future state, What mortal step can take us all alone! The dragons of our past life foam behindâ Demon-lined avenues interminable, Stretch far away before the dying soul! Thereforeâ Prin. Therefore, we must solicit aid, From all that can bestow it. Gre. Thou say'st well. Prin. I hold possessionsâ Gre. (advancing). Not to hold them long! Prin. Not longâah! noâmy golden ocean ebbs, E'en with this little inland rill of blood. Gre. Hast thou done good with all this wealth through life? Prin. I have not. To be briefâfor I do feel This must be ended presentlyâI bequeath All my fair lands unto thy pastoral charge, That so their distribution may assist Man's welfare, and my peace within the tomb. Gre. Thy countenance in death shall be all light! White-robed and sceptred, on thy brow I fix A heavenly star! Prin. (feebly). That is a glittering gift: My gift, though of the earth, doth lack not brightness. Gre. Where is the deed of this so bright bequest? Prin. (fiercely). Here! [Godfrey thrusts out his mailed arm from beneath the coverlid; then rises. Enter Fabio and Tancredi, armed. Godf. Utter a wordâand thou diest instantly! Fab. Thou ow'st allegiance to the Emperor! Tan. And hast defied him. Godf. Cease my lords, I pray! It is a time for deeds. (To Gre.) Ay, brilliant deeds! Behold me ready to command a force That shall oppose your blind and misled troops, And foot them into dustâusing your name! Tan. (loudly). Count Centius! [Centius appears at an opposite door. Godf. To your safe charge we commit A tyrantâhe is mortal! Cen. Pass this way! [Exeunt. SCENE II. âGardens of a Villa in Tivoli. Enter Eberardus and a German Officer. Ebe. Why hath the Emperor followed me:âwhy thus Peril his person? Off. Sir, 't was his intent To burst all unannounced, as from the sky, And glare through Rome, striking a final blow On Gregory's fall. Ebe. Who still reigns paramount, And hurls destruction on the Emperor's head! Say you our royal master is apprised Of how the event hath turned? Offi. The news outsped The proof, as doth a screaming cormorant The coming storm. Ebe. Oh, Majesty! how sad And hollow is thy earth; for while, above, A chorus rings thy praises in the clouds, Echoes, beneath thy very throne, the truth With melancholy modulations breathe; Near and remote, as is the voice of death. Offi. My lordâthe Emperor! Ebe. How shall I meet his passion? Enter the Emperor, wildly. Emp. Deposed! deposed!âand excommunicate! Monstrous and mad audacity! This Gregory! This whirlpool-seated spawn! this offal-god For ideot fish to stare at all agape! This horned king o' the cloven herd of Rome! How dares he thus to jest with our decree, And feign this big retort! Is it not feigned? Is it not mere inflation of his state? Knows he our heel can stamp him flat as coin? Or can it be that heâO, Eberardus! Tellâtell me all thy mind; what doth he mean? Ebe. My liege, I crave your pardon, 'tis too true. Emp. True! true! dost think he will resist me then, And to resistance add supremacy, Deposing me instead? Ebe. Your Majesty Can never be deposed from hearts that love you. Emp. That love me!âbe deposed! Thou poisonous madman! Thy dreams are plagues! I seeâI see thou think'st it! But what of thatâwhat if all Germany think so? Their thinking shall not make it come to pass: Still shall my subjects know me for their king. Enter an Attendant with a scroll. What's this? a list of all the nobles' names: All who besought to attend me hither!âwhat! Withdrawingâyes, withdrawing fealtyâ Their sworn allegiance to the Imperial throne! Ebe. Great sir! I do beseech you not to lose All fortitude in this extremity! Emp. Confederate princes! Oh, confederate devils! I will but lose myself in extreme hate At such desertion. Never more shall day Afford them ease or pastime; every night I'll stuff with vague and multiplying fears; And when their turrets flame above their heads, And split like glass, through the red smoke my voice, Following the trumpet's all remorseless blast, Shall taunt their very ashes! Ebe. Pray you, my liege! Emp. What ho!âit shall be done! This instant shall my couriers mount and away! With orders to my army, which ere now Hath reached the frontiers. Where are my guards? What ho!âno answer!âho! within, I say! All silent? palsied!âare they anathematised? A few hours since, and lackies to my nod, Were plenteous as the gnats around a bough, Swayed by a summer breeze! Enter an Officer, slowly. You come with speed, sir! Your loyalty finds wings to take our orders! Off. I rather come to bring intelligence To your late Majesty. Emp. Late! Off. Of your late army. Emp. Late army!âMajesty! Off. Its leaders, sir, Advanced beyond the frontiers, have declared The throne is vacant. Emp. Oh! [Sinks on a couch. Ebe. Doâdo they say this? Off. You'll find they do, sir, if you take horse and meet them. [Exit. Emp. Confederate noblesâarmyâall desert An excommunicated king! King! I am none! Crownâsceptreâsacred headâall sink i'the dust When swords turn traitors. Knew'st thou of this before? Ebe. I did in part, my liege, anticipate Some wide disaster from the anathemas Pronounced against you. Much I feared the army, Soon as the princes and chief captains heard You had arrayed yourself against the churchâ Emp. (rising). How have I done so? Ebe. By opposing Gregory, Whom all Rome's sanctity elects and favours. Emp. Curses! Oh, tenfold curses light upon him, And those who love him!âWhatâwhat can be done? Ebe. By violence nought, my liege; or worse. But reason Would counsel to conciliate, not provoke. I pray your Majesty set out forthwith For Rome. Emp. For Rome! and lay myself along The Vatican steps, to soften the ascent Of arrogant Gregory? Ebe. My liege, consider. Emp. Consider dost thou sayâconsider what? Oh, I can read thy face; thine altered face! The lines and shades equivocate, and tell Of truths that blink on seeing first the light: A novel charge; a doubt is written on it, In the blank space of gone security. Yet speakâyet give the wordsâconsider what? Ebe. That thou artâ Emp. Throneless, and bereft of power! But I have soldiers still, who may be true. Ebe. Pardon me, sire; there 's something left untold, Full well I know that Gregory now is leagued With Duke Rhodolpho of Suabia, 'Gainst whom your armies will no longer strive. Moreover, 'tis believed that while he seeks The Normans for allies, by secret means, Shaming his sacred office, he has urged The Saxons to revolt. Return you cannot: By countless spies we 're watched. Emp. Take you this sword! I know the use of't, and on human grounds Would never blench at any mortal foe; But heaven, or hell, or both alternately, Will have me prostrate. I will go to Rome, Or anywhere you wishâI ask not whyâ But I do think I never shall return! [Exeunt. SCENE III. âApartment in the Palace of Matilda, in Rome. Enter Matilda, and Agnes. Agn. Is it his custom to absent himself, And pass long hours in solitary prayer? Mat. At times, he does so. Agn. In some oratory; Some private chapel, or deep-foliaged grove, He poureth out his soul? Mat. I have heard him, often. Agn. Heard him? Mat. No, madam! you mistake my wordsâ I have heard that Gregory doth this frequently. 'T is commonly knownâor said. Agn. Then 't is most certain Deep meditation holds him from our sight? Mat. Oh, madam! to speak truly, I am, indeed, Most sick at soul, for much I fear his absence Is fraught with peril. Where he is, I know not! Agn. How 's this? not know!âwhat peril should he dread? Enter Godfrey. Mat. (aside). Godfrey here! And cased in armour underneath his robe! Then danger and disaster fill the air. Agn. Your animosity, my lord, we know: Your injuries we doubt. Godf. Doubt you the pain Of a fond husband whom his wife deserts: Who separates herself from all his love, To kneel to a brazen idol, and believe Its hisses heavenly music? Mat. Godfrey, forbear! In mine own right, a princess of fair realms, I do claim equal right over myself, Once fair in your regard, and not made foul By your now jaundiced eyes. Godf. Have I not cause For all the jaundice which a pestilent wrong Can pour into the blood? Agn. You trample down All delicacy, my lord, in your fierce speech. Mat. Why com'st thou, Godfrey, to disturb me thus? Godf. I answer briefly: give thy signet to me, In token of command! Mat. To command whom? Godf. The Tuscan armies. Mat. Never, Godfrey! whereforeâ Wherefore dost ask it? Godf. Gregory's fate is fixed If you refuse. Mat. How fixed: where is he, then? Godf. Locked in a tower: I will not tell thee where. Agn. (aside). Ah! is it thus? [Exit hastily. Mat. What madness burns thy sense? And think'st thou, then, by this atrocious threat To cause me give thee means of execution! The Tuscan armies are for Gregory! Godf. (solemnly). Oh, wretched woman! once of soul so bright, So holy, pure, and full of all sweet gifts, That the corruption of the entire gross world Changed not thine earthliest thought into itself, But rather didst thou make an atmosphere To freshen mortal nature, and make clear The opening heavens, ascending higher and higher! Oh, wretched woman! now behold thy stateâ Polluted fanatic, lost to all shame! Mat. (aside, in agony). His words sink down upon my brain like lead! (Aloud). Godfrey, no more!âcease these insulting taunts. Godf. More thou must hear!âwhy hast thou separated Thyself from me; why hath this Gregory That separation ratified;âwhy didst thou Allure the Emperor's love? Mat. 'T is false! Godf. (seizing her arm.) 'T is true!âthou didst it to obtain his power For Gregory's use; and, failing, didst intrigue To bring his Empress mother into Rome, Enlarging thus the wing of the arch-fiend! This is not allâs' death! thou shalt hear the rest: Why hast thou, in thy palace-hall, reared up A winding stair that reaches to the roof? Why, but for prompt communication By secret galleries, with the Vatican! Mat. Godfrey! thy cursesâthese opprobrious words And vicious thoughts, keep for thy proper use: To me they not apply, nor will I bear them! Go, sir! and do your worst! Godf. (abstractedly, after a pause). What is our life?â Oh, Innocence! white-bosomed purity! Sweet essence of the heart, and its best hopes; Whose breath is of the heavens, whose path is peace; Whose presence fills all places with a light; Whose loss makes dark the sun, and poisons time; Can man mistake thee, and can woman feign,â Using thy pure divinity as a mask; Or, from the depths of nature, tearing up A power to hide the anguish and the crime That blot thy vacant throne! Mat. Do you apostrophise Man's victim, or man's conscience? If you seek To force me to your will, or to my grave, In neither shall you triumph. Godf. Am I defied? Mat. Utterly! Godf. And cursed: no spark of feeling left? Mat. I did not curse theeâand I do not now; I but defied you utterly. Godf. (dejectedly). With scorn And placid hate. Mat. With neither. I have chosen My part in life, and that will I fulfil! And what are these our small domestic feuds, Amidst a struggle shaking now the arch Of mortal time o'er the eternal gulph? In the contention of mere temporal power 'Gainst spiritual and temporal, you have taken No single-minded part; or if a part, Then opposite to mine. A mighty cause Hath driven us asunder, not my hate. Godf. (taking her hand). Do you believe I love you? Mat. You once loved meâ That I believe: why you should love me still, I do not know, nor can I have your love. [Withdraws her hand. Godf. Ah, wherefore not? it is as fond as ever! Mat. Where hast thou hidden Gregory the Seventh? Godf. Ha! Mat. Prove thy love: I ask thee where he is? Godf. Sorceress! bewitched fool! 'tis the last time That I will seek thee: he shall die like a dog! The Emperor comes!âI'll mar the weak repentance, And urge himâthough I hate him for thy sakeâ To vigorous action! I'll stir up all Rome, And head a multitude that shall enforce The imperial mandate against Gregory, And justify his death; his dog-like death, There, where he lies, held down as in a den, And watched by men who thirst to see his blood! Mat. Go, take them by the hand then: I give mine To uphold the Pontiffâto dethrone the Kingâ And load your jailor friends with their own chains! [Exeunt, at opposite sides. SCENE IV. âA chamber, with a grated window, in the Tower of Centius. Gregory, in a penitent's garment, stands among some dark pillars at the back. Greg. A curse upon strong nerves and bones and thews; They listen not to caution. What a farce Is this vile trap! (Advancing). Why did I covet lands, And new-born strength of means from coffers old? I could have done without themâand as well. This garment, too!âmy robes of state torn offâ Guido's suggestion, doubtless, and intended To sink my body and soul back to a monkâ His great prescription for humility! (After a pause). If I should die here?â'twere an unworthy end To shovel my bones up in a little heap In yonder corner! (Pauses.) What I have done stands firm; And I, the doer, throned i'the highest placeâ 'T will make it dangerous work for murderers. They 'll hardly venture it. Yet it may be done. Enter Godfrey, in his armour. Godf. At length the mighty Hydra is chained down! His many-headed and arm-branching vices, Spread out to meet the axe! Gre. It sounds like justice. Godf. Justice it is, and justice you shall have Unto the last degree. Gre. And that 's the least. What are my crimes? array them first before me! If proved, your conscience and the popular voice Are sure to acquit you; but I claim a hearing. Godf. Oh, you shall have your claimâbe satisfied: Good hearers are at call. My lords!âI pray ye Come hither to pass sentence! Enter Centius, Fabio, Tancredi, and Guido. 'T is the trial Of an apostate, sacrilegious monk, Who would amuse us first with his defence. [Godfrey seats himself in the centre, with Centius and Fabio on one side, and Guido and Tancredi on the other. Gre. (aside). They sitâtheir swords hang passive. Godf. Prisoner! Approach and hear the charge. [Gregory slowly approaches. Cen. I 'll make the first, With your permission, lords. (To Gre). The popular voice Is strong against the extortions of your state; Your new enactments gall their social life; And your contention with the Emperor Will ultimately cost much blood and gold, Forced from the mass of men for no one good. Gre. Are you a vassal of the Emperor? Cen. No. Tan. We are loyal. Fab. Loving. Gui. So am I. Gre. Is Godfrey loving to the Emperor? Godf. Peace, criminal! Most reverend Guido, speak! Gui. I would not trample on a wretched man, Full soon, perchance, to quit this mortal scene; But duty urges me a charge to make, Where crimes so manifold pollute the time. How he obtained his power by fraud and force; By murder, sacrilege, and cunning, kept it; By rapine and extortion heaped up wealth, For bribes and scheming villanies of all kinds; Is common in men's mouths as Tiber's water, Though black as Acheron when thus compared. Edicts detestable, and heresies, Whereby we know not aught for what it wasâ Gre. Divining, chiromancy, gift in signs; A phÅnix faculty to dance in fire, And special learning in the magic arts; Whereby we know not aught for what it was! Godf. Your gibes are loose mould on the edge of a grave, And wait the wafting wind! Gui. Of heresies, It were enough for proof, to steal one glance At his new calendar of saintsâa thought Surpassing credence in a future age! Of edictsâuttered with a tongue as bitter As a green stick; yea, as the holly sap; Or written in bloodâwhat more detestable, More tyrannous, than his divorce of priests From loving wives? enforcing celibacy, While that himself in deep-secluded hours, So far removed from purityâ Godf. Proceed!â Proceed to further charges! Gre. Guido, beware! And you, Count Centius, Fabio, and Tancredi, Take you good heed of him who urges you, From personal motives to commit foul deeds. I do believe the popular voice is with me: Offer me violence, and ye'll be arraigned As base assassins; or, perhaps, torn to pieces By Rome's infuriate mob, without a trial, As now ye threaten me! Godf. Listen not to him! Tried you shall be, condemned, and executed. Gre. This you determine previous to my trial, Most second-sighted judge! Cen. (to Godf.) Condemned to chains Within this tower? Gui. (whispering). For life, with little food. Godf. Oh, my lords, shame on all these half resolves! He nought denies the charges here alleged; The plague o' the time must ne'er again be sent Into the world. By his detested artsâ Be they of magic, charms, occult, or common, Abuse of heavenly things, or nature's weakness, He has ensnared from all allegiance, As from all love, the Emperor's royal mother; The Duchess Beatrice, his kinswomanâ Both these having great weight and influenceâ And Tuscany's princess. I could say much more; For I have greater cause than any here, To know and punish this usurper's crimes. Gre. It is a novel and a noble sight, Just, excellent, and edifying withal, To see the chief complainant act the judge. Gui. (starting up, and listening). What? Gre. The judge plays conjurer now, and makes the winds Alarm Lord Guido's soul! Godf. You play with words; But if we lack an executioner, Myself will play the headsman. Gre. (loudly). You look like one, clad there in complete steel! Instead of grave and senatorial robes, Shining all over with imposture! Godf. (rising furiously, and drawing his sword). Wolf-head! [Rushes at Gregory. Thou shalt not live to vent another sound! [Shouts outside. Gre. My voice hath passed through yonder grated window, To those outside! They recognise it mine! Go some one forth, and pacify my people! [Noise increased. Exit Centius, hurriedly. Gui. (aside). I thought 't would end in this! 'T was even now I heard a hum in the air of distant voices. [Violent blows upon the gates, and cries for Gregory. Re-enter Centius. Cen. The populace surround the tower with torches, And threaten conflagration! Godf. Let them threaten! Flames slowly mingle with deep walls of stone. We 'll bear our prisoner downward to the vaults, And wait the event. [Shouts and blows. A glare of light from below is seen through the grated window. Gre. Meantime, my lords, 'twere well, Ere we descend unto these vaults below, I should a few mild words address to the crowd Through yonder grate, to prove myself not murdered. Cen. Do so at once. Be brief. Godf. And then descend. [Gregory ascends to the grating. A loud shout: he waves his hand, and it ceases. Gre. Be pacified, my children! I am safe: And that I may continue safeâthis instant Burst open the gates! [The gates are burst open. The populace rush in with torches. Godfrey fights his way out: the rest are secured. Enter Matilda, Agnes, and Brazute, with Attendants. Gre. (coming forward). Where is the man in steel! I do not see him with the prisoners. My faithful guards! Hark you, sir! (Aside to an Officer). Take a troop And follow Godfrey wheresoe'er he flies: Hack off his armour piecemeal from his limbs, And if the limbs fall too, God's will be done! Agn. The impious villains!âchain them to the wall. Braz. Pyrrhicasii! Agn. (to Cen). Let the populace applaud! Mat. The Emperor hath in Rome this night arrived. Gre. In good time comes he to perform his penance. (Aside). But one day sooner, and events had changed. (Aloud). A penance, measured by his weight of crime. (To the prisoners). We 'll think of ye, my lords, and at our leisure, Ye shall hear further. Give me a robe! [They cover Gregory with a splendid mantle. Lead on! Now for this sun-set Shadow of a King! [Exeunt Gregory, Matilda, Agnes, Brazute, and suite, with guards and populace. [Manent Centius, Guido, Tancredi, and Fabio, chained along the wall. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âA Colonnade in Rome. Enter Matilda and Damianus. Mat. You falterâyour lip quiversâand methinks 'T is not the first time you have verged on this, And found no resolution shape your speech! But why leave Rome? why separate yourself From Gregory's confidence, to brood alone Within some distant monastery's cell? Dami. I do grow old and care-worn, noble lady, And weak of health. Mat. Sure, 't is not envious spleen At the o'erwhelming glory of the change Wrought by one man, while thou art left behind At bottom of the hill, round which of yore Ye both paced side by side, gazing towards heaven. Dami. Ah, no! I would but seek that state once more. The pleasant, peaceful, bird-awakened days Of learned solitude; the deep-mossed groves In Clugny, where together we oft read The words of earth's great patriarchs, and the lore Of many a clime, were to my satisfied heart More natural far than bickering crowns of power. I, therefore, crave your influence with the Pontiff, For prompt permission to depart. Mat. What need Of influence, good father? Dami. Pray you, grant it, And question me no deeper. Mat. You have some enmity, some secret fear, At bottom of this wish. Dami. (wildly). I do confess it! My life long since hath been made up of fear, Which all my thoughts and feelings rush to feed, Turning my nature thus against myself. Question me not; I dare not utter more; But gain permission that I may departâ And be you ever blessed! [Exit. Mat. This is most strange! Oft have I marked a deep awe trench his face, And fill his cheek with shadows, while he gazed On Gregory. I deemed 'twas reverence For those all-subjugating qualities: But now he stammers and shakes with fear aghast, As though a phantom should step through the wall, Or rise up from the earth beneath his feet, And take him by the hair! Why, why is this? A worthy, learned, close-conforming monk, And high in confidence, might well expect Preferment; yet, with shuddering tones he sues To hide his days in some far monastery! Gregory appals his thought: they 're oft alone; And Damianus knows his deep designsâ Has always known themâand, perchance, could tell Of deeds whose face would blacken in the light. Where will this lead me! to what dreadful doubts? My full-branched faith in Gregory hath been shaken, And I have lost the fruit of all my life. What if this being, whom I 've ever held The paragon of all that 's great in nature, Turn out half devil in that secret soul Which lurks beneath man's human secrecy, And feeds itself on humours all corrupt, That burst in action? Dreadful, blighting thought! Ye monstrous phantasies! ye unknown crimes! Ye images, whose vague limbs alternate Substance and shade, yet in your passage o'er Imagination's deep-stained, troublous pool, Shed germs that, as they fall, shriek into life! Bloody realities and harsh facts of earth, That startle us like spectres, being so plain, But never deemed so near!âfade, fade away From my confused and aching brain, or cease To follow on my flight! Oh, let me think ye The haunting shapes of mine own wickedness, Or the sad fancies forced upon my heart By Godfrey's cruel taunts! Would he were here! I grieve, I weep that we are thus estranged. [Exit. [Voices outside. Enter a Rabble, and Officers with Centius. Cen. Shout, blindfold energies! ye would rather howl, Could ye but understand that your own cause Falls with your champion. [Rabble shout. Offi. Forward to banishment! Cen. Ay, banishment! Ye hear that? shout again! Why are ye silent? Am I not the man Who, for the popular welfare and defence, Cast his patrician rank into the scale; His wealth, his reputation, heart, and hope; And poised his life o'er peril? Why are ye mute? Have I not failed in all? Where are your taunts? Offi. On, towards the northern gates! Voices. Return! return! Cen. True sympathy is pitched too high for scorn, And pity smiles on man's ingratitude. I will return as with a meteor's speed, When opportunity shakes hands with hope! [Exeunt clamorously. SCENE II. âPrivate Chapel in the Vatican. Gregory, kneeling before a lighted Shrine. Gre. And to behold A shadowy portion of Thy Countenance Reflected o'er the insufficient sea! Let the great hopes of ages concentrate In all their depth and splendour of device; Best thoughts of men, and changeless essence fine, Be mingled now in one eternal flame To spring from this one altar! Oh, my God! Thou send'st us time, even as a little rain; Thou send'st us death, as potentates of earth Their signet send; but send'st us prayer, to reach The steep stars and the thrones of the Remote, On palpitating and refulgent wings! Now do I watch the triune Diadem, Like a new planet, dawn o'er the world's shrine! Its guiding spiritâcentral in my heartâ With solemn exhortation lighting up, And vividly detaching from their shadows, Broad continents of life, and tracks of splendour, Ne'er seen by mortal eyes before; but wrapped I' the smouldering bosom of eternity, Waiting Thy procreant hand of light, through me, O God, the Giver! [He rises, and stands awhile in silence. There was a carpenter of Tuscany, Whose son, from a cowled monk, made himself Pontiff. High-fronted saints and martyrs, men sublime In aspiration and security,â Trusting to virtue, wisdom, justice, peace, The elements of nature in their souls,â Have, by thus trusting, left their tasks undone, Staked midst the roar of flames, or nailed and left In silence on the lonely night-black cross. So I, who know what blood I have within, Do act, believing all mankind the same; And, being now in thunder throned above them, Shall melt them with my fiery bolts, and pour These tremblers in the moulds of my fixed will. One Altarâone High Pontiffâand some kings, Holding in fief their sceptres,â [Signal at a secret door. Lo, I come! These small events do yet advance the whole. Enter two Guards. Godfrey is dead, thenâno!âye have poorly failed! 1st Gua. He has taken sanctuary. Gre. Ha!âin my very hands! Go now at once, with full authorityâ Enter Damianus. Dami. Thou wilt not have him at the altar slain! Gre. What didst thou say? Dami. Oh, pause! Gre. Repeat your words! Dami. That heâhad taken sanctuary. Gre. I thank thee: The news is old. (To the Guards.) Finish it instantly! 1st Gua. If our soulsâ Gre. Fullâfull pardon from the church In her own cause! [Exeunt Guards. Well said, self-sacrifice! Think'st thou I'd be the victim? Dami. Oh, my lord! Most high-dispensing Gregory! forgive me! But I am thoroughly shaken by these things. Since Alexander's death I've never prayed Audibly; but in whispers, with closed eyes. Horrors chase through my brain in dreams by night, And, screaming, act the dreadful scene again! Their monstrous variations seem all oursâ The madness ours! Oh, let there be no more! Gre. No more deaths, except mine! would you say that? For that 's the alternativeâand I've made my choice. He raised his steel o'er me, and shall draw down Electric answers! Dami. Doth this clear the conscience? Gre. Ay, like the air! Dami. Oh, my liege, make 't not so light, For conscience holds the balance of the world. Gre. I have a conscience higher than the world, And its opinion's narrow measurement; Its timorous grasp and terrors of the will At every magnitudinal desire, With all the ruinous weakness of remorse, Who lets the heaved-up stone roll down again, A self-doomed Sysiphus. Dami. I trembling pray For all my sins, and for frail human nature. Gre. Frail what? Dami. Frail natureâI do humbly own All my unworthiness to be thus placed Near one so lofty; I would fain retire: My health sinks daily. Gre. You shall never leave me! You followed me out of the cloister's shade, Believing me a great Artificer!â A throne-builder for God!âa putter-down Of militant kings!ânow you turn pale, beholding My hands in actual work; but you shall stay: We 've known each other's thoughts too well to part. To your couch!âand in your dreams remember this, In answer to your indigestion's fancies,â Conquerors for space of earth their thousands kill; Lasting dominion o'er the soulâfor which A century full of life were cheaply givenâ Needs but few offerings of this dust we wear. [Exeunt. SCENE III. âColonnade in Matilda's Palace. Enter the Emperor and Eberardus, attired as pilgrims. Ebe. Her intercession 's sure: my liege, I pray you Do not droop nowâthe worst is well nigh past. Emp. (despondingly). How canst thou say the worstâdrive me not mad! Think of the homage of enforced knees, And suppliance to those we hate, for pardon! Pardon for what? Oh, do not speak to me, I cannot bear remonstrance! [A Domestic passes. Stay you, sir! You serve the Countess of Tuscany? Dom. Humph!âWhom serve you? Emp. Say to her that a friend would speak with her. Dom. Wait here! [Exit Domestic. Emp. A menial bids me wait! The lowest office, exercised in extreme, O'ertops the highest with a gross burlesque. To wait!âI cannot understand the change; Yet everything reminds me of my fall From sceptre-sway to common, subject life. Oh, dreadful Gregory! accursed and dreadful! His voiceâhis very substance haunts my soul. His image over-shadows all my prayers; His large hands sway the air about my head, And act like laws amidst the atmosphere; My forehead aches with gazing at his foot, Puzzling its breadth and purpose. 'Tis his step! Ebe. My liege! my liege! Emp. I'm no liege lord! Away! Enter Matilda. I pr'ythee, leave me! [Exit Eberardus. Mat. Should I not meet a penitent prince, who comes, A subject's knee to offer to the church, And sue the restoration of his crown? Emp. I am that powerless prince. Mat. And penitent? Emp. To heaven most contrite. Mat. And to heaven's Vicegerent? Emp. Oh, lady! dare I speak at such an hour Of what I've felt in presence of thy beauty, It would not sink me 'neath fair manhood's pride Were I to ask some pity for my state. I am o'ercome by Gregory as by a spell! His curse, like lightning on a single oak, Has left me charred and hollow. Armies fade Before his voice: my subjects own no king; My nobles cast me forth; my very arm Hangs like a broken bulrush o'er the stream Of my now stagnant life; and in my soul Sorrow hath hung weed-garlands o'er each thought, While terror guards the porch. Oh, when the sense Of what I was, and what I am become, Struggles for steady sight, the level earth Wheels upward from beneath my feet, and leaves me Constantly sinking! Lady, stretch forth your hand! And let its lustrous whiteness interpose In aid of one whose utmost wrong to you Was fond oblivion of himself! Mat. Beseech you, No more of this; it pains me much, and wakens The depths of other days, to you unknown, But full of thoughts for me. Brief be your griefs! And may the thorns now rankling round your brow, Where late shone sovereignty, fall to earth, and rot Beyond all memory's reach! Emp. Sweetness and hope Drop from their natural home upon your lips, O'er my despair. Mat. But, well advised, and bowed With deep submission to the Rule supreme, You hither come? Emp. Oh! it doth grieve my spirit, And yet enrapture me thy voice to hear, Mingling sweet reconcilement with the gall Of humbling authority. Pr'ythee, lady, Is there some penance most severe in store? For thus 't is rumoured to my feverish ear; And, therefore, am I come to lay the grief, The doubts, the fears, the madness of the thought, Before thy mediating feet! Mat. 'T is true, Some penance is enjoined; I know not what; But counsel thee to humble all thy pride, And then resume thy crown. Emp. But what the penance? Mat. Doubtless not much in bodily form and show; The spirit 't is must bow. Emp. Madam, you pour An urn of balm upon my tortured mind: I shall in all things follow your advice. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. âGrand Hall in the Vatican. Gregory, in full state, standing on his throne. Cardinals, Bishops, Abbots, Nobles, Monks, Soldiers, and a vast concourse, are on their knees. Gre. I bless the world! let the far nations hear it! [A trumpet peals forth one lengthened note. First, all ye pillars of the Church of Rome, Receive the rays of beatific peace, And let your massy glory shed around Light, warmth, and splendour, wisdom, beauty, hope, To fill the heart of faith, and grace your power! In just gradation next, its dignitaries, Who walk erect, through life's uneven ways, Blessing and blessed; and all our holiest hands And ablest servitors,âwhether to uplift The sick or faltering, and the impious crest To smite; and whether holding temporal sway From high patrician ancestry, whose deeds Crimson fame's cheek with pride, or humbly bearing Office monastic, and a spirit of life Whose purity toucheth heaven! Thence, the vast throng, Bowed in a flock o'er this their pasturing field; Sinful, yet hopefulâand who may be savedâ And children all, of every loving land, Whose souls, like matin dews, rise up from earth! [Solemn note of a trumpet, as before. All rise, except Guido, Tancredi, and Fabio, who continue kneeling, in chains. Gregory sits. Lastly, I do confer protecting thoughts On prostrate sinners,âwho have rigidly, And to the very roots of inward sense, Their due amount of penances performed;â And on all living creatures and things that walk Or creep along the earth, or skim the sea And air! Rise, penitents; go forth, forgiven! [Guido, Tancredi, and Fabio rise, and step aside with humility. Where is the other penitent, once a king? [Damianus comes forward. Dami. Oh, supreme Ruler! the dethroned man, In ashes and sackcloth, barefoot stands without, On the bitter stones, awaiting your behest, And praying constantly, with a loud voice, For pardon and restoration! Gre. It is well: I 'll think of him anon. Enter the Empress Agnes. Agn. My lord! high Pontiff! It is the winter seasonâI had forgotâ Bethink, your holiness, of what you do!â 'T is winter's worstâ His aching gleams pierce through the marble floor, To the clear-eyed sun insensible; while, barefootâ Barefoot, the Emperor stands, and all his prayers Are choaked in clouds of his congealed breath! Bethink you, well! Gre. I do; and it is good. Agn. Good!âwhile the Emperorâ Gre. There 's no such office. Agn. What mean'st to do? What 's this! I cannot bear To see 't. My son, an Emperor skilled in arms, Thus held in lengthened penance! To what end Is this unnecessary harshness shewn, When all the forms of man's humility Have to the church been tendered? Gre. (with severity.) Royal lady! Maternal guardian! you do ill in this. Not for mere forms of man's humility, These acts of penitence do I enjoin; But for the true prostration of his pride, And heretic wickedness. Agn. Look to thyself, High pontiff! 'T is a treacherous exercise Of thine authority to use us thus! My naked heart returns unto my son, And leaves its rent, soiled garment unto thee! [Exit. [Gregory descends slowly from his throne. Gre. (aside). It must be done, though she should take his place; And that, methinks, were also very good. She shall be watched. Enter Matilda. Why wer 't not here before? Mat. (to Gre.) I have just seen, Not without sympathy, not without pain, The Emperor standing barefoot on the stones! Gre. The man you mean was once an emperor: Now he is nothing. Mat. Yes, he is still a man. Gre. Whate'er he was, or is, in fact or fancy, To nothing shall he come! Mat. Sure to forgiveness?â Though you delay it to extremity. The penance you enjoin is too severe. Gre. (aside to Matilda, and hoarse with passion). Too, too severe! Daughter, I'll judge of that. You are presumptuous, weak, and ignorant, To interfere, and fail at such a pass! It is the very point and pinnacle Of proof, beyond dispute, and sets at rest, Beneath the monument of his disgrace, Built up of prayers and groans of penitence, Their quillets for all future emperors, Who shall look back upon this dayâand bow Their heads, like savage nations when they hear The exalted thunder! Get thee from my sight! I'll have no purblind, short-breathed policies: Up the high hill at one great bound I'll go, And then direct the light seen from afar. Away! What dost thou here with half resolves? Retire, retire!âI waste myself upon you. [Gregory resumes his throne. Mat. (stunned). Some hand assist me! [Exit, blindly. Gre. Let the penitent now Approach the seat of mercy! Lead him hither! [Exeunt Monks in attendance. His diadem I purpose to restore, Receiving him once more beneath heaven's wing, When that his heart is humbled with the dust. Enter a procession of Monks; and then the Emperor, in sackcloth and ashes, bare-headed and bare-footed, with a rope round his waist. He kneels before Gregory, who raises his right hand in sign of vicegerent power. SCENE V. âA Colonnade in Rome. Enter Agnes. Agn. Oh, for a bolt of lightning, to strike down And scatter all Rome's statuary in the streets! To sweep her gods to an impalpable dust, Confused and lost in air! Let the dread hand Of great avenging nature, in our cause, Heap this blind city in one funeral pyre; Where treacherous Gregory may sit crowned with flames! But of this blindness what dark share was mine? What error, and what madness of resolve! Why did I listen to Matilda's voice, Devoted as she is, and lost of soul, To this arch-demon, whom she thought a saint; Though now the strong truth beats upon her brain, Or 'twill do soon, as with an iron mace, By knowledge of his crimes! My princely son! What, in the winter, too? Ne'er could I dream Of such a penance, and a bodily act Outreaching credible sense. I was betrayed. See, who come hitherward! more penitents; Rage and self-hatred struggle in their looks. Enter Guido, Tancredi, and Fabio. How fare your knees, my lords? do they not glow With keen reflections of your contrite hearts? Tan. With shame and fury, rather! Fab. And deep hate. Agn. Then whet your blades upon your ignominy, And send the poison back with every blow. Tan. Would it could be! Agn. It can be, and it shall! The Tuscan armies loathe this Gregory, Who scowls and scoffs at his best friendâthe sword! And ranks a soldier as the lowest tool Of his supremacy. Gui. Madam, you know the Princess Of Tuscany? Agn. Yes; and methinks she 's ours! Canst prove the murder of Pope Alexander? Canst give me proof of this, and other deeds Now darkly rumoured? Gui. No; but certainly You can obtain them, as I may advise. Agn. Enough. Matilda's soul by these fierce truths Shall be enfranchised. Tan. Madam, you startle us! Agn. The German troops will gladly snatch a chance Of thrusting home his scorn. Tan. But who will lead them? Agn. I, in my son's name! I will lead them on. Enter the Emperor, in a rich robe, with ghastly looks. Tan. (aside). How doth the lingering sense of Gregory's curse, Though now removed, return upon his heart! Emp. Have I once more a name? Gui. Great sir, take life Into your own high hands! Tan. Trample our shame! Emp. (abstractedly). Thou preternatural influence! thou pall, From whose incumbent darkness o'er my head, The dead-faced sufferers and the gleaming ghosts Start, and leap down with cries upon my soul! Break up the substance of thy panoply Of tormentâOh, retreat into the night! And let the shape-thronged whirlwind of thy spell, In clouded silence, with no parting hints, Shift and disperse! What are all these? Gui. He dreams. Agn. O, pallid image of an heroic prince! Art thou my son? Emp. This is a sorry hour! Agn. For Gregory. Dost thou mark? Emp. What wouldst thou say? Agn. Heap up destruction! Emp. Upon Gregory? Agn. Upon whom else in the wide world? Stands he not up, the highest devil that's set Amidst the scorching desert? From prostration Spring serpent-like, and strike the idol down! Emp. (bitterly). He was thine idol once, though never mine: I looked not for this change. Agn. It is his change That hath unscarfed mine eyes, and I do loathe him An hundred fold for that my soul once worshipped. Emp. His change? Agn. Say rather, the discovery By circumstance, which sails on every wind, Of blackest regions, earthed up in his heart; Luxuriant with all fruits that breed despair, Though 'neath a sapphire and carbuncle blaze, Ripe hanging over pits of dazzling gloom, They lied of crowns in heaven. Rise, thou king! His deeds in secret shall no longer bloom, But rot in daylight. From thy mind cast off All sense of sanctity, all reverent fear Of his usurped vicegerency of heaven: Murder and mischiefs, heresies and lies, Shall soon be hung i' the air where all may see! Emp. I gasp for too much breath! Hear I aright? Agn. Nay, more; methinks, Matilda wavers from him. Emp. Matilda! No, no!âsay you? Agn. Believe it well. Of Godfrey art thou sure; for even now I learnt that Gregory's murderous guards pursued him, E'en to the fane, where he took sanctuary; And long were seen to glide around the walls. Taunt me not, then, with this my sudden change; But taunt thy pride with its base penitence! Emp. All thou canst say falls faint in my hot ear: I hate myself! I madden at my thoughts! Agn. I'm glad to see it: but waste not thy passion Upon things past: the German nobles now Will crowd around thee with their powers: I know They cannot brook the insatiate despotism Of one who stole the eternal keys, and feigned That angels stooped and laid them in his lap. To full allegiance gladly they'll return. Emp. Is this true? Agn. It will prove so. Centius Must be recalled, who, with these outraged lords, And hosts beside, will join thee in the field. Tan. We willâwe will! Emp. Peace! I can hear no more! Agn. Let nations hear thee; and speak first to Rome! Dominion waits thee: look up, like an eagle, And scan the circles of yon altitude Which shall be thine! Gregory no longer shines. Emp. What! this Infallible, whom I have felt The adumbration and the realised power Of heaven and earth; chief substance of the forms That walk upon the walls of destiny! A murderer, dost thou say? A heretic? Gui. Oh, the bright day; the excellent, holy day! Emp. The German nobles, and the Tuscan force, With friends in Rome beside? Agn. All will be thine. Emp. When that my armies faded from my call, I moved as in a dream; now do I wake, And will repay, with deadly certitude, The sufferings of involuntary sleep. Agn. (embracing him). Thou art my sonâmy great, imperial son! Emp. Again I feel a king, and doubly strong: First did I mount the throne by lawful choice; Now will I carve me out an emperor's seatâ Space, wealth, dominion, majesty, and mightâ By trampling opposition into mire, Till none shall know where Gregory's armies stood! [Exeunt. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âHall in Matilda's Palace. Enter Godfrey, as if pursued. Godf. I have escaped his bloodhounds!ânow no more Is aught held sacred!âeven from the fane, Where I took sanctuary, have his minions driven me! I saw their silent-laughing, wolfish eyes, That shone demoniac through the painted glass! Oh, what a state is mine! Worn and exhausted With passion, foiled revenge, and sleepless nightsâ Pursued by murderersâmy friends subdued, Or linked with those I hate; now am I forced To shelter my devoted form hereâhereâ In the palace of a most unloving wife, Abetting my arch-foe! Most hated Gregory! Has not my folly equalled all my hate! No opportunity, no gleam of chance, Since the full hour of vengeance which I wasted, Hath e'er illumed my rapier's darkened blade. Now what 's to do?âA fiery struggle 's at hand! The Emperor in the fieldâmust I join him? I choke at the thought!âyet, to thrust Gregory down, It should be done. I 'll see Matilda first. Strange rumours and misgivings thicken the airâ Where is she? Oh, where should she be, my heart! [Exit. Enter two Papal Guards, with drawn swords; and exeunt cautiously after Godfrey. Enter Matilda. Mat. He wastes himself upon me!âthis the reward Of sympathies that reached from heaven to hell, Steeped thrilling in his never-questioned course! Now do the etherial and the nether fires Confuse and mingle their extremesâWhat 's that? A strange breath stung my shoulder from behind! What are those footfalls? Wellâwellânothing in life Seems natural to those sick of it; grief conjures With commonest sounds and things. I am, indeed, In extreme wretchedness, and my knees tremble With fast-declining health. Poor Damianus! He, too, is sinking. [Exit. [Clash of swords within. Re-enter Godfrey, mortally wounded. Godf. Oh, he has reached me! he has reached my life By hireling steel!âwould he had done it himself, So should my death-grasp sway him down before me. [Falls. The blow has stunned me! I am shading off To a sick air! My soul fades fast away! Re-enter Matilda. Mat. It is my husband!âmurdered!âGodfreyâGodfrey! He bleeds!âit pours out! Stop, stop! Oh, my God! Lift up!âspeak, Godfrey!âspeak to me! In mercy, look at me, and speak! Godf. (dying). It is an ice-drop That sinks through the melting mist. Mat. Oh, Godfrey, look at me! Godf. And a faint voice, heard farâo'er the misty sea! Was it my wife who cried far off in the mist? Mat. It is! it is thy wife! Look up! Godf. I loved herâ And send a last farewell. Mat. (wildly catching his hand). Say you forgive her? Godf. Great God! is this Thy hand Passing me onward? [Dies. Mat. He is gone!âand I, An unforgiven wretch, do seem to have hastened His awful passage. This is Gregory's deed! Where have I been? Godfrey, awake! awake! I cast offâI curse Gregory! Fix not on me Thy blood-shot, stony eyes!âForgive, forgive! [Gregory is heard calling without. Gre. Where are these Tuscan dullards?âthey were wont To lead the van of all the Papal force! Mat. It is his voice! Come, ponderous Mystery! Betrayer of the soul and body, come! Enter Gregory. Gre. Rebellion rides the wind; I hear his cry! Marshal our TuscanâOh, the accursed slaves! They 've killed him in his wife's palace! Mat. (rising). Look here! Gre. Who did it? Mat. Art thou an iron bell, Tolling men's dooms, insensible thyself? There are dread words i' the blood of those who 're murdered! Appalling pictures, voices, pointing hands! Murderer! look, look in the widening mirror there! There, where it ebbs into eternity,â Wilt thou dare ask of me again, âWho did it?â Gre. By what sad accident found he this end? Mat. Pontiff, no more! From my o'erladen soul I cast thee, as its heaviest load of guilt! Much could I sayâI leave it to your thoughtsâ And much that lies too deep for any speech. In presence of yon bleeding form, I burst All links that bound me to thee, and do pour His blood and his eternity between us! Within! within!â Bring hither my white robes! My bridal night-dress, with sweet herbs and flowers, To wrap my lord in! Enter Attendants. Where, where shall we go! [Exeunt Matilda, and Attendants, bearing the body. Gre. (after a pause). And where are now my hopes Can the grey ashes, Which sullen years shake from a dead man's urn, Rise, like the procreant dust of autumn's weeds, And plant themselves to supersede designs Of noblest harvest?âcan calamity Fall on the far futurity of my fields, And their great produce blight, with this one man? Yesâyesâa palsy shakes time's giant hand. O'er one poor corse Prometheus' self might stumble, And sink on a sudden to dark fellowship! Self-preservation thus seems double-edged, And, guarding me, cleaves through my steep-set throne. But then the future?âSo, his corse is gone! But it has left his silence in the hall, As if himself were present, though unseen. Would he were living, fierce in glittering arms! I should not feel or fear him as I do, Muteâpallidâmotionlessâstanding out straight! Horrible! horrible! I never thought before That death was horrible.â It must be borne. Matilda!âOh, nought can supply this loss! Enter an Officer. Off. Your sovereign Holiness! Gre. Say it at once! Off. The Tuscan armies are withdrawn: e'en now They pass the gates. Gre. (thoughtfully). It is an evil hour. They pass the gates?âHow stands the Imperial force? Off. Great lord, the Emperor hath pitched a tent Near to the baths of Titus, there to watch The advancing of his army from the frontier. Gre. 'T were fit he march from aught that 's left of Titusâ Titus, the embattled pestilence who marched Against Jerusalem. Oh, these warlike brands! Illiterate emperors and fighting kings. Already so near!âbut I was apt for this. The Papal Guards? Off. All armed for instant call, But much o'ernumbered by the coming powers. Gre. I 'll go alone amidst their trembling spears, And tell themâstay!âsend Damianus hither. [Exit Officer. Hath the galled Emperor burst my spiritual bonds? He may be chained once more:âthe means?âlord Guido! Who like a leaf now quivers o'er the event, And may fall either way. The Emperor yet Shall wither 'neath my rod. Myself I'll plant Full in his path tow'rds Rome, and shrouded close In monkish garments, from beneath the cowl With heaven's denouncement will his soul assault. Thereto must Guido lend unconscious aid, The madness of this sworder's sacrilege To melt in dews of fear; thus twice disarmed Before I strike him with my visible power. But if he fall not?âhow if he resist, And with the vantage of his armies strive My sway to level?âcursed be his hand! He shall have no equality! I have wrought For the supreme dominion of the world; Have gained it, and must bear high onward still. [Exit. SCENE II. âRoyal Tent near the Baths of Titus. Martial Music. Enter Officers and Soldiers of the Imperial Army, followed by German Nobles, 1st Off. Will it fare well with us? 1st Nob. Be sure of't, sir: His Majesty of all our swords hath need, And spurns no reconcilements. He approaches With angry looks, but pardon in his hand. Enter the Emperor, Eberardus, Fabio, Cardinals, and train. The German Nobles and Officers kneel. Emp. Rise! and remember our great clemency; And in your thoughts let past rebellion live Only as fuel for your love. [They rise. (To Ebe.) Art sure of this? Tancredi, then, will lead The Papal armies. Ebe. He is seduced, my liege, By Gregory's subtle and o'erwhelming tongue; Albeit, methinks, himself will lead the fight. Emp. Grant me to meet him flaming in the van! Grant it, keen honour! Where are the veterans Who fought my battles with me in Suabia? Ebe. They will arrive to-night. Fab. If heaven be with us! Emp. Our own picked German troops ourself will head: The rest we shall distribute for command. Enter Agnes. Welcome, imperial mother! soon thou 'lt feel Thy son redeem his gage in thy proud thoughts. Agn. I doubt it not; and higher to confirm Thy purpose with strong hopes, I come to tell thee The Tuscan army now is all thine own! Emp. How should this be? Agn. It is no matter how; But understand at once that Godfrey 's dead, And hither soon Matilda will arrive Thy cause to aid. Emp. Matilda aid our cause! The sound runs through my veinsâdidst say, Matilda? 'Gainst Gregory too,âher husband dead? Agn. 'T is true. Emp. (aside). Oh, what conflicting passions crowd my soul With lifting joy, too bright to see its way! What memories of early blissful dreams Quenchless imagination casts afresh On the heaped embers of my wounded breast,â Sore with disgrace, and prostrate penitence Before the foot of one who held her fast In supernatural bonds!âa rivalry, Clear as the light at bottom of a well, Though darkness wall its depths. Come, all my thoughts, Hopes, passions, and the instincts of my nerves! And to my sword give edge for Gregory's fall; Which hell roar up to meet, and midway poise In soul-suspended torment! What is this? Enter Matilda and Centius, with armed train. Ye sainted shapes! ye bright ecstatic powers, That hover o'er us, what a change is here! Agn. Count Centius, too, from banishment returned! Emp. Princess of Tuscany! we bid thee welcome With a full heart, that 's troubled with many things, Yet hails thy presence with deep thankfulness, And ever-cherished thoughts. Mat. I recognise The Emperor! [She moves apart. Emp. Who knows not how to thank. Welcome, good Centius; heretofore, methinks, Not loving toward us. Cen. Gracious prince! receive My present frankness for apology: The popular cause is flung aside, and sinks Before these swollen contentions; like small fry Amidst the sweeping plunges, bursts, and whirls, Of gross leviathans at war or sport. [Moving towards Matilda. Emp. Your rudeness, sir, shall serve you best a-field. (To Mat.) Well hast thou chosen thy general, noble ladyâ Mat. (aside, moving apart). The approach of man fills me with shuddering, Lest that he touch my garments, or set foot Upon my shadow. Emp. (aside). Wreck of loveliness! Her thin handâdimpled once and dazzling white, Oft toying daintily with saffron locks, Now hangs a sere-veined leaf at her straight sideâ That 's shapeless with neglect, and swollen with griefâ Whose waving symmetry was like a cloud Of incense round a shrine. Agn. (to the Emp.) She stands in a vision! Let be awhileâthe struggle is within. Epm. Can nothing aid her? Agn. No, 't were dangerous: She might sweep round and face us as her foes. [Agnes and the Emperor confer apart. Mat. (aside). Talking and plotting to pull Gregory down! His enemiesâ't is possibleâwaste their lives On him, as he did waste himself on me. Oh, what a sickly weight! what fluttering spasms! But nobody shall knowânot even he. My hair 's all scorpions and my brain all fire! Its myriad thoughts are singing one fierce tune, With confused unity that ends in ashes! Merciful elements! oh, waste yourselves On this crushed heart, and supersede revenge In my oblivion! Emp. (to Mat.) Doth the Tuscan force Hold itself ready to obey our call? Mat. (as if waking). It dothâand ye may all act as ye willâ Nor care I if an earthquake take us all! [Exit. Emp. Her brain is turned! Agn. Quiteâquite. Cen. I fear she will run mad into her grave! So sweet, so gentle once! Saw you her eye-balls Project and glisten? Agn. Think of her men at arms, And of the heretic Pontiff! 1st Car. Pray you forbear, Most royal lady, that appalling union Of words. Though Gregory we repudiate, The holiness of the Sovereign Pontiff's office Claims deepest reverence still. Emp. It is most true. Agn. We bend to your rebuke, lord Cardinal. Enter Guido. Emp. Welcome, our good archbishop of Milan! Gui. To my dear liege, all homage! I am come, In part to greet and bless you ere the strife; In part a suppliant. [He kneels. Emp. What is this, my lord? We deemed thee ever loyal. Gui. Ever, ever! I now would crave a boon. Emp. Name it, and rise! Gui. Our holy Church with incense of its love Thy steps attends, but I feel sick with fear Lest thy fierce struggle with Pope Gregory, Wherein we join, blind dangers should involve; With foot too rude, the Church's sanctity Approaching, and salvation of our souls, Which ne'er should tamper with these mortal coils, Setting at risk. Emp. How 's this?âmy lord, no more! Gui. (agitated). I have heard voices of the martyred saints Exhort me from the walls, the trees, the air! And holy men came to me in the night, And solemnly stood beside my trembling bed With high-wrought speech! And one of them announced A mission from above, with counsel charged, In this your difficult pass, that so your feet Unto your lawful throne should nobly speed, But tread on nothing sacred by the way! Emp. Thou dost confuse my sight! I'll hear no more. Rise, rise my lord! Gui. Yet hear the boon I crave. Emp. Be brief. Gui. That it would please you, gracious sir, Forthwith to meet for conference and advice, This holy father who a message bears Of awful warning, vital to your soul And to your crown. This do ere you advance For battle. Agn. Fie! thou 'rt weak, my lord archbishop. Gui. Weak as a mortal face to face with death, And listening for his doom. Emp. Is this a time? Gui. It is my ghostly careâmy love that cries With voice importunate. This holy man Awaits your coming. Emp. I'll not see nor hear him: Delay mars all. Gui. (rising). Think of my words, great King! Agn. Shall this suspend your sword, now raised to cleave Straight through the crest of hated Gregory! Emp. It shall not! I shake off, and blow to the wind All terrors of his usurpation's sway! Marshal our horsemen! let the ringing steel Give token of their mounting brilliancy, Like armies fresh descended from the light, Down-sweeping o'er the earth! On, on to Rome; And wild-eyed tumult herald our advance! [Martial music. Exeunt. SCENE III. âOuter walls of a Monastery. Marble tombs. Time, sunset. Enter Gregory, habited as a Monk, and Damianus. Gre. How now, frail nature! think'st thou I shall fail? This way he 'll pass, and here will I confront him With solemn warnings from the endangered Church. Dami. I rise upon the waves of thy resolve: My heart 's uplifted, and I shall not fall. Gre. Good Damianus, dost thou call to mind, In Clugny's monastery, when we two Were lowly acolitesâ'tis now some years; Forty and moreâthat, in my cell one night, When all the brothers slept, an oath we swore The papal power to lift above the crowns Of subject princes? Lo! we 've seen it done. Now comes a final struggle for the hand That wrought this work; and if 'tis hewn to earth, Its deeds spring up the same. Dami. But thou 'lt prevail? Gre. Assuredly, as thou hast ever seen. Dami. (aside). And yet I tremble: would this hour were past! (Aloud). The Countess of Tuscanyâ Gre. She will return. Do not disturb my calm. Think'st thou, lord Guido Was urged sufficiently? Dami. I well believe it. Gre. Then will vague fears enforce him constantly Unnerve the Emperor's purpose, and prepare His impious will for censure. Hark! retire! [Distant sound of martial music. Dami. (aside). If they should recognise him?âif he failâ Unarmed amidst their madnessâand alone? He must not know my fear. Gre. Retire, I say! Dami. Your guards I 'll plant at callâlet me, too, stay! In time of peril I would never leave thee! Gre. My purpose will be best advanced alone. It is the Emperor with his train that come This way: his armies pass o'the other side. Retire, good Damianus. Dami. God inspire thee! [Exit. Gre. I do invoke it from the boundless depths Of this my human heart! Oh, give me words, As from Vulcanian forges, armed in proof, To shield or smite! (lets fall the cowl over his face) and to my breath impart A spirit of lightning! Blasted be his tree Of life, which I will tear down and uproot, Chanting Thy Name! Enter the Emperor, Eberardus, and Guido. Emp. Why stand'st thou in my path? Gre. It is my path, O Emperor! and not thine. I am a servant of yon holy house, To which thou also shouldst in faith belong, And kneel with reverence. Emp. Stand aside, rude monk! Dar'st thou my faith impugn? Gre. By God's command! 'Twas not in dreams that pious Guido heard The spiritual breathings of the night,â The deep words echoed from a sphere remote: Beware! thou 'rt warned! Gui. My liege, our souls are perilled! (Aside). And yet that voiceâthat voiceâwould I dare speak! Emp. (to Gui.) This is the holy man, of whomâ Gui. It is. Gre. The broad sun sets; and o'er yon vault is spread A smouldering purple, touched with crimson flame, And based on gloomy gold. So shews the fate Of kingdoms. Yet a little while, and night Comes down, and with a universal blot Sweeps out the gorgeous picture. Wickedness Is short-lived as this scene; and while the glare Of the world's tainted glory gilds its skirts, Evanishing so fastâfrom bottomless pits Issues its first wild cry midst torments fierce, Prepared for impious kings, who each shall have His own exclusive hell. Emp. Father, these words, Which I receive prophetic, as yon scene, Of Gregory's turbulent grandeur and dark fall, Dar'st thou to me apply? Gre. To thee, and all Who 'd trample on the Church! Emp. I vow myself Her truest servant. Gre. Wouldst thou equivocate With the all-seeing, the all-knowing God, His high Vicegerent scorning! Emp. Never, never! Gre. Kneel'st thou before the Apostolic chair? Emp. Most reverently! Gre. With armies at thy heel? Emp. My armies march to thrust from off the throne Of sanctity, a bold usurping man; The tyrannous arch-hypocrite Gregory! Father, give way!âset on! Gre. Behold these tombs! Emp. Time pressesâsee'st thou not thy lordâthy king? Gre. What is a lord or a king compared with thunder? See them stand underneath; mark well their looks, And think of nobility! These are the tombs of kings! Emp. The dead are silent. Give me passage, monk! What wouldst thou more? Gre. The silence of a corpse Is thunder to the soul! Listen awhile, And thou shalt hear these monuments rehearse The woes of nations; uttering cavernous sighs, Death-fraught as pestilent breezes borne afar From isles of gloom along the sweltering sea. Sumatra, Java, and dark Borneo, Ne'er shook from heavy and hearse-headed trees Such baleful odours! Think'st thou that the souls Of those who made large havoc in the world, Peopling the grave in virtue of their crowns, By wars accursed, are now enshrined in bliss? Think'st thou to 'scape the torments of their doom By reverent words, while devastating brands Await thy shout for blood, e'en in the eye Of heaven's Vicegerent? Emp. Monk, I will not fear thee: Nor shall thy words sink deeper than mine ear, Since Gregory is cast out! Gre. Cast out! By whom? Emp. By his own deeds, which sing aloft i' the wind, Like evil spirits forced to celebrate The history of their fall. There is no Pontiff! Gre. Who saith it?âthou! Thou fell'st before his power, Flat as a shadow! Gregory to the Church Hath been her lifting and firm-holding arm; To her dominion adding force and scope; To all her sanctity a higher aim; To all her splendours unity of tone; Taking and giving an exulting light, Like to a scarlet mantle in the sun! Emp. The Babylonian scarlet! Gre. (tearing off his monk's habit). Fires o' my heart! Emp. What ho, my guards! is this an ambuscade? Imperial Guards rush in; and Damianus, with several Cardinals: the latter range themselves beside Gregory. Gre. Fires o' my heart!âthou central source of fire, Loose all thy tides! Emp. They shall not turn my course. Gre. Down to thy knees! Behold me as I am, The ruling presence, bearer of God's keys! The golden, self-sustained, pre-eminent cloud, Whose inward breast holds all immortal life! Emp. That cloud is black within, and it shall burst In rain, and disappear from the earth's face. I spurn thy usurpation, and defy thee! Gre. (slowly). Emperor of Germany! why art thou here With armed bands and homicide looks of war? Why flash the bloodshot eyes o'the trembling steeds? Why scream the trumpets o'er the music, tuned To barbarous deeds, while banner and buckler shew Gross painted effigies which commemorate The glorious battles of immortal fools Who drove out mercy from the human heart, And with red Furies filled the steaming fields? Why art thou here, chief lamp o'the horrid show; And what are thy intents? Emp. To enter Rome, And in the Vatican proclaim aloud Thy wickedness and fall. Gre. Bethink you well Of your last visit. Emp. Therefore am I come. Oh! doubt me not I shall remember it; The better, that with reason in the mouth And madness in the brain, thou comest to thrust A brand amidst my never-closing wounds, And urge to final action by thy calm Smile of insane superiority. Forward to Rome! Gre. I do forbid you, solemnly, in the name Of allâ Emp. All thou profanest by thine own deeds: I scorn thy raving and thy prohibition. And what shall serve thy taunts at feats of arms? Disgust at the keen glories and high scenes Of necessary and ennobling war,â The hypocritical horror in thy looks? Thou, who didst get and hold preposterous power Entirely through main force and sworded hands; Else hadst thou lived and died within thy cell, An obscure, scowling, self-corroded monk. Gre. (calmly). This is not true. Emp. Not! Gre. (passionately). By my soul, 't is false! Was it by war I made Rome high in art; Heaped her with beauty and magnificence? Was it by war vast libraries were filled, And wise men ceased to beg about the streets? Was it by war the Vatican reared her crest O'er all your temporal palaces and powers? Was it by war, by main force, and the sword, That I, the son of a poor carpenter Of Tuscany, did gather up strong thoughts, Learning, and eloquence, and energy, Till on my brows I fixed the triple crown, And made an Emperor kneel like a child before me? Emp. (stamping with rage). To arms! Gre. See where he flies to arms, d' ye mark! Forbear, I charge ye! Dread the curse of Rome! Emp. We 'll dread no curse that one like thee can hurl. Stand from my path on peril of thy life! [Damianus and the Cardinals advance. Gre. My life is sacred, as my curse is sure: I do revoke the pardon I conferred! Emp. I dare thee to the field! Away! away! On to the city! Gre. And again depose thee,â Emp. Sound to the charge! [Trumpets. Gre. And excommunicate! Emp. Charge the Papal Guards! [Exeunt all but Gregory. Alarum. The charge without. Gre. (after a pause). Power writhes out of my grasp, while I do seem To crush what I would cherish; and the coils O' the high-necked dazzling serpent, wise and strong, Drop heavy at my feet! The charge without. Enter an Officer. You had my orders! Off. They were clear as steel, But could not be effected. Gre. Could not be? Off. Dread sir, the Emperor hath this instant charged With his main force. Gre. (contemptuously). I heard him: So may you know By the small click of his machinery, When the invisible grasshopper takes a leap At the far sun. Your phalanx did not move? Off. 'T will move no more till the Last Day! [Retreat sounded. Enter a Messenger. Gre. And you? Mess. The Count Tancrediâyour chief leadersâall Are slain! The Papal forces fly! Gre. For vengeance! They fly to the onslaught? Mess. No, no! for their lives. Gre. Now, by my father's hand! my mother's spirit, Which early broke her heart! I little reck These closing accidents of life's brief scene. The world doth spin from underneath my feet, Or else my brain turns giddy and sick with its noise. Enter Damianus. What worse, what worse?âpale Damianus, speak! Dami. Oh, friend! dread sir! your troops are all dispersed. Take refuge now: ere long you may return. Gre. My heart 's too heavy to move. Curses pursue them! Dami. Oh, stay not here! you tempt your fate. Gre. I do; And I defy her! Fate 's an idiot Confronted by man's will; and never yet A single high-branched action reared or blighted; But only gabbled after all was done. I'll wait till the firmament comes down. Dami. What shape Of desolate agony approaches now? Gre. Away, and let it come! [Exit Damianus. What more can come, When hope is irretrievably lost and gone? 'T is she!ânow would I turn aside, and shun The sands of such an hour. She comes to me! Enter Matilda (who advances with an air of forlorn anguish, breaking occasionally into fits of distraction). Mat. Perfect humanity of Christian souls! All knowledge, grace, and happy love are thine, Pure nature guides the clearness of thy ways, And general misery shews 'tis all a lie. See! see!âsee what a piteous height she rose! Methought she leaned upon a heavenward tower, And the tower fell to earth. Light, light the candles! The shrine is dark. Now it sheds blood for rays! Now all is dark again; and laughter shakes The base o'the crucifix! There is a hand Upon me!âtomb-o'erstumbling misery Hales me by the hair before Christ's spurning foot! A cold shape risesâit is Annihilation!â Oh, thou cold Glare! frore, eyeless Altitude! Dim, interlunar giant! shadowed light Of my lost substance of eternity, Receive this wasted being! No, no, no! I would fain live, and save my sinking soul. The shrine bursts forth in light! I am turned blackâ Opaqueâincapable to take one ray. Oh, thou sweet-featured Christ! look not upon me With eye severe: I strove on fatal wings, And most sincerely fell. Give me the cords! The music sounds at Satan's wedding feast; I must dive deep down through the icy air! Gre. Am I the shape I wasâthe thing called power, That woke this morn from natural human sleep? Mat. (approaching Gre.) Oh, you are here! Emperor of Germany, I know you well, Though you disguise yourself like Gregory! But what avails you that?âthe gravest dwarf Doth look most laughable in a great man's robes. I come to say I shall return to him, With all the Tuscan forces: they're not like Godfrey's imaginary myrmidons; But steel-shod cattle to tread empires down: And thus his murder shall be well avenged. Emperor, I trample thee in Gregory's name; Gregory, the supreme ruler of the earth! I dreamed he had become a little child. Hush! hush! be silentâOh, be silent I pray, For nobody knows of this.â They're coming!âthey bring the perfect humanity, With skeleton morals and a full-fed doom. Pity me, pity me! where shall I fly The howl of Christian souls? It faints on the wind. (With steady earnestness). We do not make ourselves, but we are made right. My flesh is ague, and my bones are ice, And therefore have I led a perfect life, Which reason, chastity, and heaven approve. You look at me as if you knew me not; Or do I see thee far, far off i'the mist? I 've been confused with deep conflicting thoughts, But you shall hear my name: I am the ruins Of the city of Magdala! woe and alas! The sun doth waste himself upon me! [Exit, with a moaning anguish. Gre. Wheel on, ye spheres! intensest particles Must fly off first. Come thou Infallible Death! I take thee by the hand; but save my sight From that wan faceâmine ears from those lost cries! Enter Guido, Agnes, and a German Officer, with Guards. Gui. Yonder he stands, confounded! Agn. Now, advance. Gui. He wanders blind through ruins of high hopes, And feels their chilling shadows. Speak to him! Off. Surrender all authority! Agn. Homicide! Gui. See'st thou Pope Alexander's famished form Hovering before thee? Agn. See'st Duke Godfrey, In 's bloody winding sheet, and hear'st thou not Matilda's frantic voice? Gre. (abstractedly). Hush! be ye silent: Oh, be silent I pray! Agn. Canst thou hope mercy? Gui. (aside). What doth he gaze upon in the mid air, Far onward? His face changes!â [To Officer]. Let us not Act cruelly, but firmly, sir. Off. (to Gre). You are The Emperor's prisoner! Agn. To the city bear him! Our yoke of triumph brooks not this delay. Off. Wilt thou not move? Agn. Drag! drag him hence! Voices. Away! Gre. (with lofty melancholy). Rude winds, rude winds! ye shall as easily drag Tri-zoned Jove's star-set eternity Back to his past life on Olympus old, As move my body or soul! Agn. (to the Guards). Are ye struck with frostâ Or stand ye pale i' the disk of a gorgon shield? [Shouts outside. Off. Madam, retire! Gui. Your stay were perilous! [Exeunt. Manet Gregory. Gre. Am I too strong for death?âlet him come soon! Enter Damianus, with a small body of the Papal Guards. Dami. Oh, save yourself! the Vatican 's all a-blaze! Its choice collections, grandeur, sanctity, In clouds of ashes now float back to heaven! Gre. (rousing as from a trance). Who hath done this? beware thou tell'st me truth! Dami. It was the Emperor's deed. Gre. I suffocate With his name! Burn down the Vatican, dost thou say? Dami. And catching fury from the voluble flame, Raging he now returns in search of thee! These soldiers do devote their livesâand vowâ Gre. (passionately). Ye handful of good soldiers! brim your hearts From mine, with all-exterminating wrath, And armed invulnerably 'gainst man and fiend By this high mission, acted in God's eye, And with His nostril's breath impelled, now follow My forthright course, which never shall be turned! Oh, for some terrible sword, that I may slay! Slay! slay!â [Exeunt. SCENE IV. âOpen space in the Campagna, among the ruins of ancient Rome. Night. The Vatican blazing in the distance. Faint Alarum. Enter Fabio, with troops, meeting a German Officer. Fab. Still holds the fight? Off. 'T is done. Fab. E'en now I heard The ring of arms through the dark ruins echoing! Off. 'T was but the last gust of a storm outspentâ The frantic rally of some score of spears, Led on by Gregory. Fab. He is not dead? Off. Unless a miracle hath caught him up To the stars. Fab. This dizzy momentâit confounds The beating of my heart and all my thoughts. I know not if I dare to wish him dead. Enter Centius. Off. My lord, are you wounded? Fab. Is the Pontiff slain? Cen. 'T is doubtful. Fab. Sir, beseech youâin few words! Cen. (faint and breathless). With sword and shield, but in no armour clad, A storm-black charger bore him towards the ranks Of the Emperor's force. What passions lit his face! He rushed, breast on, amidst them, man and steed: No violent Centaur ever shook an arm So terrible in air! The very clouds Seemed to come down, although, indeed, you'll say 'T was but the spurned earth's dust. Fab. And is he slain? Cen. I know not; overthrown with many more, Like to some raging element he rose, On all sides devastating. He fought afoot, Till smitten and speared on every side, he fell: When, o' the instant, Cardinal Brazute His form bestrode, and to our gleaming swords A crucifix opposed. Some desperate monks With screams then bore him off. Enter the Emperor, Guido, Eberardus, and armed train. Trumpets. Voices. Hail, Emperor! And conqueror! Fab. The saints have blessed our arms. Emp. Dagon of Rome! thy heaven-affronting crest No more shall arch its neck above the world; Nor Henry's soul, with threatened torments rent, Tossed by contending surges of his fears, Hopes, apprehensions, doubts, and dreadful dreams, Again be steeped in madness and despair. Gregory, mortally wounded, is borne in by Damianus and Monks; followed by Brazute and other Cardinals. Rejoice, great line of kings! the serf-born breath That sullied your enshrined memories, Now hovers o'er the gulf! Set him down here, And bid the clarions cease! Dami. Lay him down gently. Gre. (dying). I hear the roaring of the Vatican flames! Its statues fall with Gregoryânot its hopes. Die, heart! die quickly! Braz. Clement the Third, we name, Duly by us elected, Sovereign Pontiff! Gui. 'T is prematureâthe Emperor,â Braz. It is done. Voices. Vivat Sanctus Pater Clemens Tertius! Dami. Let not our voices drown his parting sigh; Oh, be our silence an intense heart's prayer! Distant Voices. Vivat Sanctus Pater Clemens Tertius! Gre. (faintly to Dami). We have not failed; my breath fills all the place. Emp. What hath he murmured, monk, into thy breast? Gre. (faintly). Approach, thou perfect hero, who hath ruled This day of swords! Approach me with thine earâ Stoop nearerâI wax faint. Emp. (stooping to listen). What wouldst thou say? Gre. (raising himself). Kiss thou the dust from off thy master's feet! [Dies. Funeral Mass without. The body of Matilda, extended upon a bier, is borne across at the back, while the Emperor speaks over the body of Gregory. Emp. All falsehood follow thy descending soul! And in thy fall more reason shall we find To bow with reverence to the See of Rome, When pious hands shall sanctify its power! THE END.</field>
