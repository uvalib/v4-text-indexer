Julian, Count of Tortona, under the name of Alfonso, performing the functions of Hospitalier to the Convent. Francis, Servant of Agnes. Claude, Guide. Peasants, Assassins. Women. Agnes, Countess of Tortona. Ellen. Female Attendants belonging to Agnes. SCENE, the Convent of the Great St. Bernard, and the Rocks adjoining. Time, that of Representation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The wildest Alpine scenery of ice-mountains and precipices covered with snow, in the environs of the Great St. Bernard. The travellers are seen on different heights amid the windings of the rock, slowly descending the pass leading to the Vallais. First, Francis with two Guides exploring the way, and sounding the hollows with long poles: then Agnes by herself, preceding a litter borne by the mountain-peasants: on either side of the litter a female Attendant, followed by a Page. Agnes. Agnes. Oh glorious Sun! illumin'd by thy beams These wastes of snow, these Alpine solitudes Have pow'r to sooth me. [advancing, and looking on different parts.] How distinct each rock, Smooth-brow'd, or spiring high its tapering peak! Yon range of wavy sweep, and this that breaks Eastward in varied forms like floating clouds! Their hues, how changeful! these, of roseate glow, Those, azure-dy'd: and some that climb the sky Fling to the light their summits cop'd with gold! Oh thou, who spak'st creation into birth, How glorious, Lord of Nature, these thy works: How awfully sublime! Fran. Each step we tread Leads to new dangers. Guide. Sound that snow-heap'd cave. Fran. How fearfully yon tumbling rock o'erhangs [Turning back to Agnes. The narrow pass. Beware! Agnes. Proceed, good Francis. Fran. Here yawns a chasm, down whose depth, the sight Wanders without repose. I'll gaze no more: Its very horror, while it shocks the sense, Most strangely fascinates. [He advances. These slippery fragments, Hurl'd by the tempest from the crags above, Roll loose beneath me.âLady, let me aid you: Lean on this faithful arm. Agnes. My foot treads firm. To those who know not grief such ways are painful. I have within my soul what mocks at toil. Fran. You were in luxury nurs'd, nor have been us'd To scenes like these: I, in my childhood, rock'd In want's stern cradle feel these aged sinews, That never shrunk in war, ache with each step As slow I labour on. Oh, honour'd lady! The holy brothers of St. Bernard warn'd you Not to attempt the pass. Return, I pray. Yet, yet amid the rocks a lingering echo Heaves back the slow clang of the convent bell. It is for you I fear. Agnes. My will is fix'd. Go with the guides, and timely warning give If aught impede the way. The topmost snow Stirr'd by the zephyr's breath, may swell before it To size impassable. Fran. I must obey. Agnes. [to those who bear the litter.] Be careful, I beseech you; this steep path Betrays th'unsteady foot: guard well the litter: You shall not lack reward. Kind, gentle maids, Be watchful of your charge. I first, myself, Will this sharp ridge explore. So may'st thou, Ellen, Securely pass, and ere death end thy woe Find peace once more! Fran. [to the guides.] Heard you that sound? Guide. Most plainlyâ The voice of men advancing. Fran. List! again Up as the gale comes slowly from beneath, I hear distinct the noise of echo'd steps. Guide. 'Tis strange in this new season; so far well, Claude enters. The rocks below are open.âWelcome, Claude: It is the provost's guide. Thrice welcome Claude: How fares the reverend Albert? Claude. Heav'n has heard The convent pray'rs: he looks restor'd to youth: Another man! 'Twill cheer your heart to see him. He will be here in th'instant.âHark, they come. I haste to warn the convent. Fare you well. Guide. Oh happy hour! Heav'n guard his sacred life. Claude. [going, speaks to Agnes.] Lady! I pray you let the litter rest: And in this cave, that fronts the mid-day sun, Wait till the train pass by. This narrow ridge Will else your lives endanger. [Claude goes. Agnes. [to her train.] Repose awhile, my friends! and in this cave Set down the litter. Your good Provost comesâ Not these bleak rocks alone, and the Alpine swains Echo his praises: far and wide his virtues Call forth the general blessing on his head. The Provost and his train enter: as the Provost passes, Agnes speaks. Your benediction, father! Pro. Peace be with you! Those widow's weeds, this melancholy train:â Daughter, you seem in woe, and pale your cheek Thro' sorrow more than years: what urgent cause Compells you to these mountains? Agnes. Holy father! I pray you pardon me, nor deem me one Rude or untouch'd by kindness, that I leave you, My tale of grief untold.âThese sable weeds But ill express the anguish of my soul. But seek not out the cause. The pow'r who tries The mourner, smites in mercy. Thou hast blest me: Farewellâ Pro. Yet, mark me, daughter, no vain wish To hear what may in utterance grieve thy spirit, And ill may suit my years: but sacred duties By heav'n enjoin'd, and sympathy of nature That bids an old man, vers'd himself in woe, Feel for the grief of others, prompt my speech.â Agnes. When thou dost pray for those who grieve on earth, Remember me. Pro. Yet there are lenient words, Balm of the soul. Daughter, my way of life Has been where sinners wept, where sorrow sigh'd, And anguish groan'd around me: and I know How willingly the mourner, bow'd with woe, Broods o'er the secret pang that life consumes. This must not be: heav'n link'd us heart to heart To heighten every pleasure, and by sharing Lessen the load of misery.âSilent still? Turn not away regardless. Agnes. No, good father; Each word thou speak'st is treasur'd in my soul. Would I might freely at thy feet pour forth What weighs upon my heart. I am not one Infirm of mind who fondly broods o'er woe. These tears, that will not be supprest, gush out Not for myself alone. One farewell pray'r. Trust me, the burden of my grief is lighten'd: For thou hast pitied me. Pro. In silence mourn, I will not urge thee more. Heav'n sooth thy soul! But I conjure thee, if thou value life Turn to our hospitable roof again: There wait till fitter season may ensure Thy safe departure. Duty forc'd my step Now in this hazardous time: not far the roof That shelters me: but long thy way, and perils No arm of man can ward, surround the path Where-ere thou goest. And these lone rocks at times Are crost by ruthless robbers. Agnes. I must on. Pro. No roof, no shelter near, nor safe return, If the dim night-fall steal on thee unwares. And oft the sun in these unsteady skies Sinks, ere its close, in tempest. Agnes. I must on. [Pointing to the litter.] Here lies a hapless woman, one who wastes Hourly away, worn out with ceaseless woe: An uncomplaining sufferer, nigh to death: A native of yon vale; her only wish Is yet once more to view the peaceful spot To childhood dear, and there to find her grave Amid her kin. Farewell. Pro. May heav'n protect thee! [Exeunt omnes. Scene the second the Convent Cloisters. Prior and Confessor. Prior. Say, hast thou found Alfonso? Con. No, good Prior. He mus'd not in his cell, nor duely came To join th'assembled monks, Ere the fixt duties of the convent call'd Each to his separate office. Prior. 'Tis most strange. Con. I have made careful search, and closely question'd The brethren, one by one. Prior. Who last beheld him? Con. Juan. At dawn while he unbarr'd the gates, Alfonso darted forth Striking his breast in anguish. Prior. Heav'n protect him! Sooth, all ye sainted host, his woe-worn soul! Con. Alas! my mind misgives me. Prior. How? Con. I fear We ne'er shall see him more. Unhappy man! Our holy Provost to these walls returns To fix anew our duties. Much methinks He dreads the issue of that solemn inquest, Which here confirms him in his perilous charge, His only solace: or for ever drives him From this lone roof. To him he must reveal The anguish of his spirit. Hapless man! Fain had he died unknown! Prior. Hear, holy Saint! Thou, who didst found 'mid everlasting snows These walls, thy earthly residence, look down! Look down on him whose unremitted zeal At life's dread risk, has highly minister'd To thy most blest intent!âHear, holy Bernard, Nor to the storm and conflict of dark passion, Abandon poor Alfonso! Con. Yes, my brother, Service like his, nor wealth, nor worldly honours Gain or repay: its source is in the heart; And in the spirit that there prompts to act, Finds its sole recompense. Prior. If fervent pray'rs, If tears of gratitude by others shed, The pilgrim and lone stranger, at life's hazard, By brave Alfonso rescu'd from destruction, Could heal the wound that bleeds with inward pangs Peace on his soul had shed her lenient balm: But 'tis not so with him. Con. Noâmany a time When the lost travellers, whom his arm from far Bore 'mid the howling night-storm, whom his hand Long chaf'd before the hearth, with grateful look First turn'd th'awaken'd eye on poor Alfonso, Who hung all pity o'er the seeming corse: How have I seen him from his dark cheek dash The tear away, and fly the open'd lip That pour'd its blessing on him. Steward enters with Laymen bearing logs, &amp;c. Stew. Haste, my friends, Rake up the embers, pile the glowing hearth With unctuous pine, The sight shall cheer him, and the crackling blaze Breathe grateful fragrance round. Then, deck the board, And freely cull what best may furnish out Our frugal banquet. [Exeunt Laymen. Con. Whence this sudden haste? Stew. Ring out the convent bell, that the loud peal Recal each absent brother. None must fail Of their accustom'd duty. Prior. Stay, good Steward. Stew. The Provost is expected, and each moment We look to greet him. Prior. All good angels guide him! But say who brought The welcome news? for scarce the lower rocks Peep thro' the snow: and, save some pilgrim bound On fearful penance, and that mournful train Who left at morn the convent, none have dar'd The dangerous pass. Stew. You know the southern guide. Prior. What, faithful Claude? He, who for many a season Has claim'd the convent prize, his custom'd due Who from the pass first clears the drifted snows? Stew. The same. He left our long-expected Provost Now as he slowly up the mountain toil'd. Farewell; my charge awaits me. [Exit. Prior. Peace be with you! Alas, no common call, in this rude season, Has forc'd good Albert, bow'd with weight of years, To leave the shelter of the peaceful vale. 'Tis not alone to fix our separate charge; Mandates from Rome, strictly to scrutinize Each layman and poor hind that serves the convent, (For rumour dwells on bad men harbour'd here) Now urge his step. Con. Full well we know his mission That shames this sacred roof. Alas! that slander Should feign, that here the ruffian and fell murderer Unquestion'd guests, have found familiar shelter. Such haunt not here. Sad years of ceaseless wars That long have wasted fair Italia's plain, Turning to barrenness her fruitful soil, Have steel'd men's hearts; and, haply, from the camp, Outcasts, who prowl when late the battle bled, And pluck'd, 'tis said, while the warm blood yet flows The covering from the wound, at times have sought Night shelter from the storm. Else, never here Have lawless men found refuge. Prior. Go, my brother, Ere Albert yet arrives, search out once more Alfonso's lonely haunt. Heav'n guide thy steps! [Exeunt. END OF ACT THE FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Convent Hall. Provost, Prior, Confessor, other Brethren, and Laymen. Pro. [to the Laymen.] Brothers! no charge of murder rests on them. Depart in peace, my friends! Heav'n's blessing on you! Would that the princes of the world, and those That sigh on golden beds, could lay, like you, Hands innocent of ill, on guiltless hearts, And taste such sleep as yours! depart in peace! Sacristan enters. Sac. Alfonso is return'dâyetâhapless man! Pro. Why stands he not, as duty bids, before us? Sac. Oh he is loth to come. Pro. This is most strange. Sac. I found him, in the cemetery, lone, 'Mid many a stranger corse, unsepulchred, Still-gazing on that pilgrim, lately found When slipt the snow-heap from the southern ridge. His face was yet unchang'd, and calm each feature As when he rested on the snow, while death Stole on his sleep. So calm, Alfonso look't, Such too his smile: each seem'd the other's image: Scarce could I tell who of the twain had life, Or who had ceas'd to breathe. Pardon me, father, Long-time I fear'd to break that solemn trance, And when at last I rous'd him. Con. [interrupting him.] 'Twas not kind To rouse him, brother. Well I know his nature, You should have spar'd him yet a little while, 'Tis long since holy peace has still'd his spirit: That time his soul had converse with its maker. Pro. But when at last you urg'd himâ Sac. At the word At once the trance dissolv'dâhe started up, And frowning darkly on me, bad me say That never earthly ear should hear his grief, If thou reject his pray'r, to wear out life Here, amid perilous laboursâthus he left me, And onward 'mid the mountains swiftly rush'd, Regardless of my answer. Prior. Holy father! Send forth the Confessor: with him alone He communes willingly: but shuns us ever, Save when a sufferer common aid demands. Con. Yes, I have sooth'd his melancholy soul, And won at times to half-form'd confidence, By tales of woe which breath'd to tranquil minds Had rack'd the soul with horror: still to these He gives most heedful ear. Pro. Go, sooth, persuade him. [To the Confessor, who departs. It must be strange unexpiated guilt Harrows his soul: and was it right, good Prior, To give him charge among you? Prior. He deserv'd it. Such thoughts as trouble you, at first came o'er us, When with wan look distraught, and wild attire, He call'd at midnight, when no foot beside Long time had scal'd the snows. Our wary eye Watch'd o'er him. Stern his brow, and strange his mood, Yet at our call most zealous: so months past, He still the same. When patient Anselm died, (Heav'n rest his soul! he fell in manhood's prime, Worn out with toil) Alfonso, now long-tried, Here vow'd to pass his dedicated days A cloister'd menial, and with earnest pray'r Besought his perilous office. Look on us: Age and infirmity here bow before you. Point out the man whose limbs could stand that charge. Pro. Noneânone; I blame you not. But say, good Prior, How doth he exercise his charge? Prior. With zeal Passing belief. His labour shames our service: For still in boist'rous months, when all within Shake at the tempest's roar, and icy blast, Singly he ventures forth, his dog sole guide, At starless midnight, or when drifted heaps Have hid the pass: nor seeks again the roof, (Tho' numbness steal on his o'erwearied limbs) Till he has sounded each snow-cover'd cave, And long and loudly call'd, if heard from far Shrieks of the lost night-wanderer strike his ear. So pass his days away. Claude enters. Oh holy fathers! Pro. Claude, what brings thee hither? Claude. Help, speedy help! or she for whom I beg Will not long need your succour. [to the Infirmier.] Good, good father, This is thy office. Yes, we know thee well, We who frequent these mountains. Pro. Take thy cordials: Rare medicines: and this strongly scented oil. Its essence once inhaled, thro' closed lips Will call the spirit back! Inf. Where are the sufferers? And what their numbers? Claude. 'Tis but one poor soul,â A delicate tender creature: one of those That left at noon your roof. She would away: Though at that time, methought, a deadly paleness Was settled in her face.âOh how it griev'd me! Inf. But where, where are they? Claude. They had past the storm-house Where, every day, at noon, and fall of night, Ye kindly leave, for those who chance may need, A dole of bread and wine: this, they had past A little space, when they who bore the litter In which she lay, slipp'd on the melted ice: And much I fear the fall has quite o'erpow'r'd her. I never thought that thing of such slight frame Could heave so deep a groan. And so I help'd them To bear her to the shed, then hurried hither To claim your aid. Inf. Come, honest Claude.âFarewell! [to the Monks.] Pro. Heav'n guide, and prosperous issue crown your labour! Say, was she of that train whom late I greeted Where rushing from the mountain snows, the flood Ceaselessly roars? Prior. No other foot but theirs Has dared the pass. Pro. In vain I urg'd them back. Know you their names? Pri. They wish'd to be conceal'd. Some secret cause of grief ('twas whisper'd so) Unmeet to be divulg'd to common ears, Silenc'd enquiry. Yet a prattling page Who loiter'd o'er the hearth, said that his lady, The dark-stol'd dame, was Countess of Tortona: And he did hint of a poor peasant girl Tales of strange importâbut we sought not out What misery wish'd conceal'd. Pro. The noon-bell strikes. Come, holy duties call our thoughts to heav'nâ Here meet again. Alfonso must be question'd. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Storm-house, on one side of the rocky pass, amid the Mountains Agnes, Ellen in a litter sleeping, Attendants, Blanche and Laura. Agnes. Soâgently bring her to the open air. A soothing sleep steals o'er her: soft she breathes. How sweet her tranquil look! and lo, that smile: As if an angel touch'd with earthly woe Look'd down upon her slumber. Blan. Such art thou In mortal semblance. Agnes. [looking on her.] Sleep, poor hapless Ellen! Three painful years are pass'd, since I have watch'd thee, And laid thy stranger brow upon my breast. I have assuag'd thy bitterness of grief, Sooth'd the wild dreams of a distracted mind, And led thee to the view of opening heav'n, Where tears are turn'd to gladness: but such sleep Till now has ne'er been thine. Francis enters. Francis! Oh say, Will they proceed? Fran. No golden bribe will tempt. I have explor'd the further tract. Agnes. Well, Francis! Fran. It is impassable. Agnes. Oh say not so. I will myself explore it. Fran. None can pass. The rock more rugged far: and that bright sun Which cheer'd at dawn of day, its noon now past, Has turn'd to foaming streams the melted snow. Agnes. Yet, if the convent send sufficient aid, Still, still we may proceed. Fran. E're I turn'd back Reluctantly, (I know thy stedfast mind,) Prone from a crag that overhung the road A snow mount thunder'd down, and barr'd all progress. Some from the convent soon will join our guides, And warrant safe return; and, pardon lady! I have long serv'd you. Agnes. Say whate'er thou wilt. Thy lord esteem'd thee highly. Fran. Aye, these arms Oft fondled him in childhood. Agnes. By his side Thou hast in battle stood, when many a warrior Fled from the field. The man whom Julian honor'd I hold my friend. Say on, nor fear offence. Fran. Would I had died in battle at his feet, E're liv'd till now: e're seen what now I see, The Countess of Tortona like a slave, Tending a peasant girl: one too, who lur'd, Aye, and by witching wiles;â Agnes. [interrupting him.] No, not thy virtues, Nor privilege of years, nor length of service, Zeal for my house and honour shall avail, If ere thy rash unhallow'd breath shall whisper Disgrace on her. Rather aloud revile The memory of him whom most I honour; The man, who but for this, had proudly stood 'Mid men unrivall'd: if thou deem it base To serve my will because I sooth her woe, Such service I disclaimâgold thou shalt have, But never look to see my face again. Thou art in tears: nay, rise. Fran. Not look on me! And give me gold! I am indeed most vile. I never felt what service was till now. If you do wish my death, bid me begone. I rashly spoke what zeal for you inspir'd. She was not the seducer. Agnes. Peace, good Francis! You touch a string that vibrates on my heart. Still calm her sleep? [To the Attendants. Blan. Most tranquil. Agnes. Such repose I fear bodes nought but evil. From the convent None yet arrive. 'Tis vain without their aid To move her hence. Fran. They will be here, ere long. The guide, whose ready zeal so won our hearts, Was fresh, and nimble footed. Agnes. Go, my friend! Yon height commands afar the winding path: Look, if you see aught hastening. [He goes. Julian! Julian! Thy word enjoin'd not this: but not till death Has still'd that woe-worn frame, will I forsake her. But thou! Oh art thou with the living! or with those That grieve no more? what earthly voice can speak! Since that dread hour (oh! let me not recal it!) My search how vain! and save that fatal scroll Which bad me raise thy tomb, and deem thee dead, Gave me thy worldly wealth, and loos'd the tie That binds eternally my soul to thine, Of thee I nought have heard. Wert thou on earth, This now had been thy office. No. I wrong thee. He who sustains my soul, and bids me, here, Shelter in life's last agonies the orphan, And her that has no helper, had once more Made one our wedded hearts. Francis, the Infirmier, Claude, Guide, Laymen, enter. Fran. [to the Infirmier.] Haste! holy father. Inf. Where is the sufferer? Agnes. Here, in still repose. Inf. Has she long slumber'd thus? Agnes. An hour, or more. Inf. Rouse, rouse her quickly. Chafe her temples, lady! Here, hold this pungent spirit. [Ellen sighs. Agnes. Oh that sigh! Inf. You of the southern climes, you haply know not, Amid these chilling snows when sleep steals on, How fatally it ends! the blood too rests, And every vital part forgets its function. Sleep here is but the harbinger of death. Agnes. The harbinger of death! oh rouse her not: Sir, she is broken-hearted. Inf. I must do What duty bids, and with unwearied zeal Apply all earthly means to bring back life. The rest is Heav'n's. Agnes. [to the Servants.] She wakesâstand, stand apart! How is it with you, Ellen? Ellen. Wellâquite wellâ Free from all pain. Agnes. Your cheek, methinks, is ting'd With a faint flush like renovated health, But weak, most weak your voice. Why do you gaze So earnestly around? these are your friends, Those of my household whom you ever lov'd, Blanche, and kind-hearted Laura: this good man, One of the convent brethren. Ellen. I scarce knew Whether I liv'd or not. I've been in heav'n: You too were there: indeed I ever thought you Too good for this vile world. Agnes. Compose thyself. Ellen. I am most calm. Agnes. Oh hush. Ellen. I am not wandering. But most distinctly as I now behold you, I saw you there. [pointing up.] And I, poor Ellen, help'd To place a crown of glory on your brow. And there came oneâI dare not, Saint on earth! Before your honour'd presence breathe his name. He, in this world, has had his doom of woe. Oh say that you forgive meâne'er, till now, While my poor mind was mineâ Inf. This must not be. Daughter! be still! speak to her, tender lady! Speak, if thy gushing tears permit the utterance. Agnes. Sweet Ellen! clasp my hand. Ellen. Thou more than parent! Had not thine eye met mine, when first I woke, I had not thank'd this charitable man For forcing life upon me. Oh! I faint. Agnes. Here, on my bosom rest. Ellen. Thou art most kind. Yes, I shall soon have rest: eternal rest, And thou thy heavenly crown. [Swoons. Inf. Hereâbear her up. Agnes. Oh gently with her. Inf. Good St. Bernard, aid us! [Exeunt. Scene, a Lake on the South side of the Convent surrounded with Mountains covered with snow. Alfonso pacing restlessly to and fro. Alfonso. Alf. Ye mountains! on whose heights when first ye tow'r'd, Coeval winter stood! hoar cliffs! where Time From the first stretch and waving of his wing, Shed everlasting snows! oh hear my voice, Fall on my brow! and thou, on which I tread, Immoveable rock! rive thy deep base beneath me, Nor give me back, till at th'appointed hour I, and each secret sinner upon earth Stand up, and hear the doom that shall not change. It will not be conceal'd! they shall hear all: Or I once more on that loath'd world beneath, Must stand all lonely 'mid the moving press Like one, on whom the blue plague, as it past, Shed visible taint. Confessor without. Alfonso! Alf. Ha! Confessor enters. Con. Alfonsoâ 'Tis he. I long have sought theeâlouldly call'dâ And thrice the convent bell has warn'd thee back. Alf. It 'scap'd me not unheard. Conf. The Provost sent meâ Alf. Consents he to my wishes? Con. Trust his kindness. Alf. He comes to search my soul. Con. Not your's alone. Each layman, every hind that serves the convent, Have render'd strict account. Alf. Pure sinless souls! Why wound their spirit with unfounded questions? They have not shed man's blood. Con. 'Tis true, they urg'd th'enquiry. Alf. And ere now Each to his day-task hies with lighten'd heart, Merrily trolling forth his mountain song: Each with the good man's blessing on his head. Con. So shall thy soul find peace. Alf. Oh neverânever. Con. Thou dost not know his kindness, but thy deeds Are known to himâ Alf. [troubled.] What deeds? Con. All, all, whate'er Zeal and unwearied toil, and dauntless courage Have wrought at life's dread risque. Alf. Would I had perish'd In rescuing others! Con. Why thus dread the Provost? To him reveal thy grief: He is not, as some are who wear our garb, Of soul austere. Virtue in him beams forth With seraph mercy: and his way of life 'Mid scenes of misery, but in closer bonds Links him with those that suffer. And hoar age, That draws his spirit nearer to his God, Looks kindly back on those who toil below. If thou hast sinn'd, in him the penitent sinner Beholds a fatherâ Alf. But I have not shed The tear of penitence. Who probes my soul, Must loath the thing I am. I shall pour forth To his astonish'd and incredulous ear, Guilt that shall shock his soul, while tears gush forth In pity of man's weakness. Con. Calm thy spiritâ Alf. [highly agitated.] These rocks have heard it; and the night-storm borne On his dark wing, 'mid cliffs, and hollow caves My echoed groans; and I have quak'd to hear, Sounds as of men, accomplices in guilt, Muttering their tales of murder. Con. Sooth him, Heav'n! Be calm, Alfonso; these wild burst of passion Will but arouse suspicion.âWhy thus grasp me? Alf. Suspicion! Who beheld me? Where th'accuser? Come to the Provost. Con. Not till thou art calm. None shall behold thee thus, so strangely mov'd. I oft have still'd thy grief. Alf. Thou art most kind. Con. Look round; this scene shall sooth thee: Long years may pass, ere in these storm tost heights, A sky so clear, air of such temperate breath, And sun with scarce a cloud to veil his glory May visit us again. Alf. Oh holy comforter! Scenes such as these have rais'd my voice in pray'r, 'Mid solitudes where none on earth could hear. Oh that the innocent joys of days long past Might steal me from myself, like lenient dreams Of friends that are no more. Con. Nay, inly brood not. Look on yon azure sky, and call on Heav'n.â Oh hang not o'er that lake which stilly sleeps: Its hue is dark and dreary: tho' it spread A polished mirror to the rocks around. Why dost thou gaze so fixedly upon it? Alf. Look where the shape of yon o'erhanging crag That thwarts the sun, lies shadow'd on the lake, How suddenly th'gathering ice shoots on, Chilling the wave beneath. E'en so it fares with meâthe winter, here, [Striking his breast. Turns every object that the eye doth glance on, To its own cheerless nature. [Starts back from the lake in the utmost agitation.] Heav'n and earth! Saw, saw you it? Con. Whence that wild look of horror? Why start away? Alf. [looking round.] Where did the spectre vanish? Con. What spectre? I beheld none. Alf. Thatâthat form Which scowl'd upon me, thereâ[pointing to the lake.] not earthly, sure? Oh never yet did flesh and blood assume Such ghastly semblance: never living eye So look'd. Con. Oh merciful Heav'n! Alf. I do conjure you, Oh tell meâam I then that ghastly form? Was it myself? was there none other here? Con. It was thy shadow'd form. Alf. [vehemently.] Come to the Provost. What need of vain confession? guilt is on me: Deep graven by the visible hand of heav'n, Like his that bore upon his brow the blood Of the first slain. Come to the Provost, haste! [Exeunt. END OF ACT THE SECOND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Hall of the Convent. Monks in Council. Provost, Prior, Infirmier, Steward. Prior. I hear their steps. Alf. [without.] That, that, or nought on earth Shall force it force meâ Prior. Hark! it is his voice. We pray thee, kindly question him. Alfonso and Confessor enter. Pro. Alfonso, I come not arm'd with harsh authority To wound th'afflicted soul: not mine the office From the reluctant bosom, ere the time, To pluck th'unripe confession: rather mine To praise thy deeds, and here, before the brethren Proclaim thy high desert. Alf. It is the motive Alone that sanctions all. I claim no praise. Pro. Bow not beneath despair. Whate'er thy crime, Know that, unceasing at the gates of mercy, A beckoning spirit calls aloud to earth, âThou, who hast sinn'd, repent, and sin no more: âKneel here, and enter in.â Alf. Yes, I have sinn'dâ Pro. So have we all. Alf. But mine are deadly sins. Pro. Great is heaven's mercy; and our holy church Has pray'rs and pennances of pow'r to cleanse The soul from all pollution. Alf. Not from mine. Penance to me! who, watchful of the sound, Heard the night tempest call, and walk'd abroad When nought but heaven's avenging ministers The lightning and wing'd whirlwind mov'd on earth! Talk not to me of pennance. Pro. Art thou one Who once knew better days: one, whom fair fortune Allur'd to summer seas, then left at once A lonely wreck? Alf. I have known better days. No other terms shall force the secret from me. [to himself. Pro. Discourse not with thyself; to me give answer. Hast thou by stern necessity compell'd, To deeds against thy nature, link'd with men Of lawless life, and stain'd thy soul with blood, To silence the accuser? Prior. Holy Provost! We, we will answer this: no stain of blood Rests on Alfonso. Alf. Answer'st thou for me? Ye know me not, nor e'er shall hear my crime, Till thou hast promis'd, nay by oath confirm'd, That whatsoe'er the guilt which I reveal, Thou will't not drive me hence. Thus far be known: That of such deeds as now you question me, Wealth gain'd by force, and cool deliberate murder To silence the accuser, I am guiltless. Grant this, or I am mute. Pro. Hear, man of guilt! And when I speak with Heav'n's authority: Bow to the dust. Alf. Deep guilt doth weigh me down. But I'll not speak: nor shall ye force me hence. Look here: behold this scar; no battle wound, Tho' I have bled in war. This impious hand Struck at my life: and, if ye force me hence, Think on his guilt, the slayer of himself!â Beware! beware! ye know not what it is:â But I have fought the demon of despair, And sunk beneath the strife. Pro. Sinner, I come Such as thyself, the heir of frailty, Shackled and gall'd with man's infirmities, To weep with thee, to bend my knee with thine, Teach thee, like me, to raise thy hands in pray'r, And meekly shed the penitential tear That drops down healing. Speak to me, my son! He, who conjures thee, spreads a father's arms To fold thee to his bosom. Alf. Kind, kind man! Thou shalt hear all: I will obey thy voice, Butâohâin pityâforce me not, I pray thee, To that strange world below: here let me labour What yet remains of life: not long the term. Vigils and painful service soon must end me: Look on this wasted frame. Pro. Here rest in peace! If peace here visit thee. Alf. [kneels to him.] Thanks, gracious father! Pro. Disclose thy name, thy rank, what urg'd thee hither, And what mysterious motive here enchains thee To such dread hazards, that the oath-bound monk Shrinks from the toil. Alf. All shall be fully told. Julian my name. Wealth and fair heritage Of lands and castled towns, amid the Peers Of ducal Milan, rank'd me first in pow'r: My palace tow'r'd on proud Tortona's brow, And Iâits lord. Prior. Thouâthou, Tortona's Count! 'Twas but this mornâ Alf. [interrupting him.] Nayâif you disbelieve, You'll hear strange things. Pro. [to the Prior.] Be silentâone rash word May all confuse. Alf. About my twentieth year, Ten years now past; [gradually becomes more and more confused.] nayâwonder not. These locks Once dark as jet, on sudden chang'd to grey, That night I stabb'd myself: and, whence this cheek With more than time's deep traces sadly furrow'd, Your haunts can witness. At my twentieth yearâ Till then, each wish indulg'd, that Fancy form'd. Oh had I, ere that time, by Heav'n's kind chast'ning, But tasted at the brim, but sipp'd one drop Of that sad cup whose bitter dregs I drain, Haply I had not been the man I am! Virtue had charms for me. Noâno. It sprung not From Heav'n's eternal root: 'twas the frail flow'r That gaily blossoms in life's sunshine day. I pray your pardon.â Where left I off? Pro. You said your twentieth year. Alf. That was the time, when brave Novara's lord, Stricken by age, but still in heart a warrior, Proclaim'd a tournament: his daughter's hand The envied prize: if he who gain'd the field Made oath, when wedded, at his own free charge To arm five hundred knights, all cas'd in steel, In right of Sforza's heir, from Milan's throne Driven by ambitious France. Pro. We know those wars. Alf. I went, I won the prize; a beauteous bride, One whose rare mind, high-character'd, o'erpast All that the eye-presag'd of inward worth. Ill fated Agnes! breath'd a man on earth Who slightingly had nam'd thee, on his head My sword had thy pre-eminence maintain'd, Peerless above thy sex. Yetâher I leftâ Not thenânot then. Five years first glided on, Five peaceful yearsâandâhappiness wasâher's. Then came the wars, and all the accidents Of doubtful conflict. With our forces march'd The Banneret that led the hardy Swiss: One for his skill in arms call'd from his flock: A swain, but proud of soul. What needs his name? that time I sav'd his life, And he too rescued mineâhimâhimâI murder'd. Pro. Oh heav'n! Him who had sav'd thy life! what demon urg'd thee? Alf. [highly agitated.] Here, here the peasant smote me. The wide world Has rung with my disgraceâa soldier's blood Boils in these veins: but seek not out the cause. He should have plung'd his dagger in my heart, As mine was sheath'd in his: deep in the heart. That had been noble vengeanceâbutâa blow! Pro. Vengeance! for what? Alf. His sisterâoh! his sister! Oh, miserable Ellen!â Her, her I wedded. Pro. You said Novara's daughter was your wife. Alf. [much agitated.] Yet, yet I wedded Ellenâdidst thou think One of such purity, not angels purer, Had deign'd to meet my love, save that she deem'd A husband's rightful arms were linkt in hers. Pro. But where is Ellen? Alf. Ha! Pro. Tortona's Countess Erewhileâ Alf. [half frantic] Where, where is Ellen? Would that I saw that angel stretch'd before me In any form of death: her pale cheek cold; And the mild languor of her azure eye Fixt as I gaz'd upon it! would to heav'n That on your barbarous rocks I found her corse, Transfixt with light'ning! so she were but dead. Then, ere th'avenger call'd, I should once more Know what it is to weep. Oh! Ellen, Ellen! [He weeps. Pro. His tears gush forth. May it relieve his anguish! Prior. Oh! cease to torture him. Pro. He looks more calm. Each tear, that trickles down his cheek, allays His troubled spirit. Alf. Yetâa little while, Kind men! I will be briefâye must not leave me, It weighs less heavy here. Pro. Another time! Alf. Heav'n may not grant again an hour like this. In the last battle at Novara's siege, When Tremouille and Trevulci led the foe, And, from their steeds dismounted, Gaul's brave knights Stood with portended spears, in firm array Immoveable. When fear had seiz'd our host, The Banneret and I, in arms sworn brothers, Rush'd emulous on, and in our breasts receiv'd Th'opposing points. Our men, the opening made, Follow'd and conquer'd. As we bleeding lay, âBe thou, (he said) a brother to an orphan, âWho has but me.â I vow'd, and swoon'd upon him. When next I woke, 'twas in Novara's walls: Of him no more was known. Pro. You said you slew him. Alf. You shall hear all. The Duke restor'd, when war had ceas'd to rage, My name and rank disguis'd, I went as one Dear to her brother: and within a dell, Lock'd in by heights which scarce the neighb'ring swain Cross'd with his flock at summer, found the orphan. Oh! at the sight of her, the peasant girl, My soul at once discover'd why I sigh'd, Clasp'd in Novara's arms. Spare the recital. I wooed, I won, and wedded her. Pro. How! wedded! Alf. I wedded Ellen, aye, and time flew by In bliss not earthly, while remembrance slept: But when the fiend was rous'd, fang'd scorpions stung me. At times, false cause pretended, I withdrew, Short absence, to Tortona: there the smile That ever met me, Arm'd with new sting the viper at my heart. I had less keenly suffer'd, had reproof Scowl'd at my entrance: it was never so. But oh! the curse! while Agnes clasp'd my neck My thought was of another! on a day, When annual feast and revels rous'd Tortona, In honour of our nuptials: as the pomp Mov'd on, the Countess radiant at my side, Forth rush'd the Banneret; yet, yet, I hear him. âTraitor! receive from him who sav'd thy life âFit meed for guilt like thine:â he spoke and struck me, Struck me, Novara's daughter by my side. Then my swift steelâ Pro. I thoughtâ Alf. [interrupting him.] 'Twas there he fell, But died in Ellen's arms: and his last breath Bound her to break the tie that link'd her soul To perjury and murder. I return'd: At sight of me, for still our hearts were one, Her woe to frenzy rose. That time this hand Aim'd at my life: heav'n will'd not so my death: Tho' rumour widely spread it. Pro. At our hearth We too have heard, confusedly told, thy death: And the hous'd pilgrim still describes the tomb Rais'd by thy Countess; where each day and night, All hours, unwearied orisons call down Heav'n's mercy on thy soul. Alf. The loud report Had struck on Ellen's ear: for now she knew Her base seducer. Pro. How! Alf. The Banneret (Escap'd from chains,) returning to his home, Found on her neck my picture; but no voice Ere told, till now, that I, Tortona's lord, Garb'd like a peasant of the northern Alps, Watch'd at craz'd Ellen's side, where'er she stray'd, Begg'd from poor hinds, and forc'd, where pray'rs avail'd not, The scanty meal that fed her. None e'er told That oft, to sooth her woe, o'er unknown rocks I toil'd, and smooth'd her way to Milan's vale: And clasp'd her in these arms when on my tomb She sunk in tearless swoon. 'Twas never known When months had thus gone by, and lenient time Had still'd her groans: that while with heav'n-rais'd eye, She breath'd my name, and kiss'd my pictur'd semblance, That I forgetful, gaz'd too fondly on her, And all the truth flash'd forth. Pro. I dread th'event. Alf. She started from my arms, while tears, methought, Gush'd down her glowing cheek. Then turning suddenly to one I saw not, âBe thou obey'd! (she cried) and, thus address'd me. âKneel on this tomb, and swear by him in heav'n, âThou ne'er wilt trace my wanderings, ne'er enquire âIf weal or woe betide: ne'er look on Ellen âTill dead, or dyingâswear, that so my blessing âMay rest on thee hereafter.â I obey'd, Nor ever saw her more. Where is she now? Is the deep slumber of the dead upon her? [frantic.] Weeps she, or raves, lone, reft of every friend? Hark! hark! on me she callsâI come. Pro. Restrain him. Oh hold his struggling limbs. Soothe, soothe him heav'n! Alf. [after violently struggling, breaks from them.] Ye shall not hold me here, unseen of men: No, I will stalk commission'd o'er the world Like Heav'n's enquiring spirit. Guilt shall shake At my approach, and youth turn grey before me. Look, when I view the boy in lustihood Of health and beauty, as he reels along To the deluded virgin, in his grasp I will infix this dagger. At my bidding The breast, that glow'd beneath his touch, shall bleed. She too, shall deem the blow. Oh! Ellen! answer.â Far kinder than the kiss that fir'd her soul. There end her woes: and while she rests in peace His eye may look on heav'n: mine never more. [bursts away. Pro. Haste, haste! restrain him! bring him back, my brothers! END OF ACT THE THIRD.</field>

This steel lacks blood. 2 Assas. Our booty shall not fail. Be patient, brother. 1 Assas. Why did you lure us from the southern plains?

Shout on! shout on! here none will look to find me: Or if they chance to spy me, who will dare Climb up this giddy edge? they nigh had seiz'd me, But for that jutting point on which I sprung, While they past on beneath. Sacristan and Confessor enter. Sac. See you the track Of his uncertain step amid the snow? Con. It ceas'd on sudden. Sac. Long my eye pursu'd it, In mazy shiftings all irregular. Con. Aye, purposely confus'd to mock pursuit. He's fled, I fear, for ever. Alf. [wildly laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! Sac. Heard you that noise? Con. Sure from the air it burst: For never foot of man E'er scal'd these mountains. Sac. Let us once more hail him. Alfonso! hoâAlfonso! [Clashing of swords heard behind the scenes. Agnes. [behind the scenes.] MurderâHelpâMurder. Fran. [behind the scenes.] This good sword shall free you. Agnes. [behind the scenes.] Help from the convent, help. Sac. What cry was that? Con. I heard the cry of murder. Hark! 'tis the clash of swords. Francis and the Infirmier enter. [to Francis. Speakâwherefore thus. Thy looks stare wildlyâthere is blood upon thee. Fran. [to the Infirmier.] Your limbs are fresh, back to the convent, haste. Ring out th'alarum bell. [Infirmier goes.] Three men, assassins, Disguis'd like those that on the mountains urge The chamois chase, have seiz'd the hapless ladies. I battled, long as these sore-mangled limbs Could stand their poniards. Alf. [leaping from the rock, and snatching his sword.] See! th'avenger here! Wash off, kind heav'n! the murder on this blade, By the assassin's blood. Come, lead the way. I have in battle cop'd with mighty men, And foil'd proud warriors. Fran. Give me, Sir, your arm. My wounds bleed fast [Exeunt. Scene, another part of the Mountains. Agnes, Countess of Tortona, Ellen, Assassins. Agnes. If 'tis my wealth you seek, I gave you all. Assas. Dame, if your strength had match'd your fearless mind, Your wealth had ne'er enrich'd us. Agnes. [to the other Assassins going to bind Ellen.] Bind her not: She scarce has pow'r to lift her hands in pray'r. Assas. To her, to her she points. Ellen. Oh wound her not. Here, here, good men, these stones, they say, are diamonds: This had escap'd youâtake itâspare her life. 'Twas once a nuptial presentâsoâfarewell. [Kissing the picture, which she gives the Assassin. I fondly thought to have worn thee in the grave. Spare but her life, and I shall die content. [Swoons away. Agnes. Hear me, unhappy men! and mark my words. I am Tortona's Countess, and I come To bear this sufferer, more than daughter to me, To the lone vale below that gave her birth. Let me pass on, and this last duty pay, And, by yon heav'n! I vow, [Gives a ring to one of the Assassins. Whene'er you show this ring, I will redeem it With riches, that shall free your future days From deeds of guilt. Assas. [looking upon Ellen.] Her pulse is stillâit beats not. Assas. Let not this corse betray us. Plunge it, there, Within yon snow-pit. Assas. Aye. I'll safely tomb her. Give me the corse. [One of the Assassins bears Ellen off. Agnes. Oh stay! she is not dead. Restore her to my arms, I will repay you With wealth, a monarch's ransom. Assas. Those will free Thyself, or thou shalt join her. Agnes. Ye shall banquet In golden halls, and o'er your tombs I'll raise Convents, where holy men by force of pray'r, Shall save your souls from fiends. Assas. You promise rarely, Alfonso [behind the scenes.] Die wretch. Goâbear her to the convent. Agnes. Heav'n! I hear the voice of succour. Man! unhand me. [Struggling with them. Assas. [going to stab her.] Nayâif you struggle, lady! you are dead. Alfonso rushes in, stabs one of the Assassins, in struggling with the other, who flies, he is himself wounded. Alf. This to thy heartâfly, murdererâthou art free. [to Agnes. Agnes. Oh what words Can rightly praise, what earthly gifts reward thee? Thus, on thy hand, the Countess of Tortona Prints the warm kiss of gratitude. Alf. [falls prostrate.] Ohâoh. Agnes. Whence that deep groan? the assassin's steel has pierc'd him. Alf. [looking up.] Not thatâI felt it not. Strikeâstrike me dead. Agnes. Whatâfor this deed? Let it not grieve thy soulâ Long ages past, a voice from heav'n decreed, âWho spills man's blood, by man his blood be spilt.â Why art thou silent? Speak. Alf. Butâbut forgive me. Agnes. In what hast thou offended? Alf. [to himself.] I must speak. The threaten'd torments of the world to come, Where sinners meet their doom, are center'd here. Agnes. In what hast thou offended? Alf. I have left The path where Virtue led me: I have strown In the smooth vale of innocence and peace, Rank baleful seed: and I have pluck'd its fruit That leaves a scar and blister on the soul, When all of earth sinks to its native dust. You know me now. Awayâ Agnes. I know none such. Alf. But you do know my voice. Agnes. Lift up thy cowl: Thy features may instruct me. Alf. Ask not that. You'll turn away in horror. Agnes. If thy guilt Aught touches me, this act of rescu'd life Obliterates all trace of past offence. Lift up thy cowl. [He lifts it up reluctantly. Oh Heav'ns!âI know thee not. Nayâgo not hence. Alf. I would not shock thy soulâ [To himself.] I will not see her more. Butâohâher pardon! I am (but do not gaze on me) I was, In happier years, when Virtue led my steps, Thy husbandâ Agnes. [she recollects him, and screams.] Thouâmy husband! Julian! Julian! And yetâI knew thee not. Thou shalt not leave me. My arms shall hold thee. Thou art more than pardon'd, Husband! Alf. Oh sound once grateful to my soul. But do not stain thy unpolluted lip. Look, look not so. Agnes. I cannot view on earth One so belov'd. Alf. Not with that eye of kindness. I cannot look on thee: oh, if thine eye Flash'd vengeful light'ning, I'd not turn away. Thou shalt not hold me more. Agnes. Am I so hateful? Alf. Next Heav'n, I honour thee, but ne'er shall saints Stoop to a fiend's embrace. Why should'st thou weep? I cannot shed a tear. Agnes. [embracing him.] Weep in these arms: And as I clasp thee to my heart, recall Past years of bliss, and pray'rs once heard in Heav'n, That in each other's arms, blessing and blest, Our life at once might close, and one the tomb Rais'd o'er us, join'd in death. Husband! sore woe Has chas'd away the vision of delight, That o'er the innocence of untried youth Diffus'd th'enchanted day-dream: it hath pleas'd The searcher of the heart, by misery's test, To prove my soul, and, here, 'mid lonely wilds Where none but Heav'n can witness, I invoke His ministering host, again to grave the vow That links my lot to thine. Come, on this bosom Rest, and find peace once more. Alf. Peace! never, never. 'Tis Virtue's heritage. Agnes. It shall be thine. Alf. The pastâthe past. Agnes. Oh be it with these tears Eternally forgotten! Alf. I have born Unmov'd the shock of horror, but thy kindness Unmans me. Agnes, I thought not to have known once more, The blessing of such tears. [He weeps. Agnes. Oh thou hast groan'd In bitterness of spirit to the storm, That smote thee, sweeping by on icy wings, And none has listen'd to thy woe, no voice Spake consolation. Where, alas! was Agnes? Ah! haply whilst thou call'd'st in anguish on me, I, far away, unconscious of thy woe, Pour'd unavailing sorrow on the tomb, That clos'd not o'er thy sufferings. Now behold me Thus at thy side, more blest to stand the storm, And sooth thy misery, than in thoughtless years, When the gay partner of vain joy, alone I glitter'd in thy sunshine. Alf. Heav'n reward thee! Agnes. Heav'n hath rewarded me: once more we meet. Oh give me all thy grief, and I will steal Each pang away, and lull thee to repose. These arms, amid the wilderness, shall stretch Soft shelter o'er thee, here thy brow be pillow'd: And ever as thou wak'st, the eye of Agnes Shall gladden thine: till in the gradual peace That gains upon thee, I shall taste, once more, All bliss that earth can give. Alf. [falling on her neck.] Thus let me thank theeâ Noâno. [Starts back in horror.] Guilt, guilt is on me. Agnes. None o'er earth, Pass without stain. Alf. No common guilt is mine. Agnes. Bow not beneath despair! I woo thee not To luxury, and light pleasures, and the dream Of joy departed. No. But, hand in hand, Now let us, in affliction doubly dear, Right onward journeying thro' the vale of woe, Soothe and support each other. Once again Here have we met, and never, never more, If virtue yet have force to sway the heart, Shall earthly pow'r divide us. Alf. Oh thou know'st notâ I cannot tell it thee. Agnes. I know it all. Oh thou art deeply wounded: drops of blood Stream on the snow. Comeâlet thy wife support theeâ Lean on me, Julian. Let us to the convent. Oh noânot thereânot there. Alf. Support me not. There was a timeâlet me depart, I pray thee, While reason yet is mine. [more and more confused.] 'Tis not this wound. 'Tis in my headâmy heartâthe fiend that tends On evil deeds, is busy with my soul. Angel of light! (thou art not of this earth) Who, from the mansions of the blest, descend'st On gracious errand to repentant sinners, Canst thou not quell this demon? drive him hence! I cannot long sustain this terrible coil? Agnes. Father of mercy! calm his troubled spirit! Alf. [frantic.] Woman! thou know'st me not. I know thee wellâ Thou art Novara's daughter: the fair prize. Gaily they came, brave gallants in their trim, High-plum'd, and banners floatingâthe proud steeds Caparison'd, career'd beneath thy throne. Thou knew'st me then, when from the vanquish'd field I bore the blushing brideâbutâwhen he struck meâ Thou looking on, upon my nuptial day, When the proud peasant struck me, at thy side, Thou did'st forget meâhie thee to thy palace: But there is one: and well I warn thee, lady! One of low birthâlook, if she flash before thee, She claims me for her own. We meet no more. Agnes. We part not, till death parts us. Alf. Am I thine? I know not what I speakâif I have utter'd Sounds grievous to thy soul, thy pardon, Agnes. It will not be controll'd. Agnes. Oh be the past Eternally forgotten! mark me, Julianâ Thy wounds require reliefârecall thy mind. Is there amid these wilds a sheltering roof, Save yonder convent? Alf. Noneâfor miles around. Agnes. Oh go not to the conventâyet thou diest Here without succourâbut there is a cause. Alf. Oh! might I perish here! thus at thy feet, Thy tears fast falling o'er me. Infirmier enters with other Monks. Inf. Haste! oh haste. The hapless Ellen! Agnes. Name her notâI charge thee. Inf. Thou must attend. For thee alone she grieves. Her wilder'd fancy views thee pierc'd with wounds Beneath the murderer's blade, speak comfort to her, Ere her last breath in frantic horror pass. Alf. Ellen! and ravingâoh! it cannot be. It isâit isâsaid'st thou not now? I heard thee. I must not to the convent? by the love Thou did'st profess, I do conjure thee, speak: Is it that hapless one? I may once more Gaze on her as she dies; and her pale lip May breathe forgiveness o'er me. Agnes. Yesâ'tis Ellen. I found her, lone, and raving on thy tomb. Gaze not above so wildly. Alf. 'Tis complete. The measure is complete. The wife has sooth'd her. What brought thee hither? Agnes. Pity for her woe. Nay, moreâ The word of Heav'n, that bids me not desert The orphan and the helpless, nor abandon To bitter scorn, one innocent of ill. Alone my presence calms her troubled spirit: It awes at once, and soothes her. I have hung O'er her distemper'd dreams, and thro' the night Bath'd with cool drop her lip of fire, and watch'd her, As one who tends a daughterâbut for me, Dark brooding grief again had rous'd her soul To frantic horror: but my voice has wean'd her From earthly thoughts, and smooth'd her way to Heav'n, And now ere life quite ceas'dâ Alf. How! was she dying? Thanks, gracious Heav'n! receive her to thy rest! Soon will her misery ceaseâbut thine, [to himself] poor wretch! Was she so near her end? then I will see her. Oh, say, say what brought thee to these wilds? Agnes. Be calm! She wish'd once more to view her native vale, And there to die in peace, and nameless lie With those from whom she sprung. Alf. Alas! poor Ellen! No other wish but that! [with fervor.] there shalt thou rest, Where from the cradle to the grave, thy life One blameless day, each tranquil as the last, Had glided on unknown in lowly peace: But I drew near, and like the tempter, stole On thy lone paradiseâthere shalt thou rest. [rushing off. Restrain me notâ Agnes. HearâJulianâ Inf. Stay, rash man! Thy wound bleeds fast. Alas! you scarce have strength To reach the convent walls. Alf. [in wrath.] Oppose me notâ Ellen! no murderer's blade shall scare thee more. Who shall delay thy passage? low he lies [pointing to the Assassin. Who turn'd thee from thy course. I, I will place thee Beneath the sod, and in thy grave, find mine. [rushes out. END OF ACT THE FOURTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Convent Hall. Provost. Pro. Thou saint in Heav'n! Thou, who did'st lead Alfonso to these rocks, Self-doom'd in just atonement for past guilt, Look down on his affliction. Confessor enters. Con. Holy father! These unexampled miseries o'erpow'r me: Forgive these gushing tears. The hapless Julian! Pro. Alas! how fares it with him? Con. As with one Not long to live: deep was th'assassin's blow. Faint with the loss of blood, long-time he lay In death-like swoon: here human art avail'd: But who can heal the anguish of the soul, Save Heav'n that smites in mercy! Pro. Say, my brother, Is he restor'd to reason, Fitly prepar'd for that eternal state That knows no change? Con. Yes, Heav'n has visited The contrite man. In Agnes' arms he woke, Calm as from sleep: in fitter hour I'll tell Their farewell interview: 'tis graven here. Pro. Then grant, all-gracious Heav'n! his sole request! Oh may poor Ellen's last forgiveness breathe Peace to his parting spirit. Con. Who shall say What may ensue, if ere they meet again? Hence flow my tears. At Julian's earnest pray'r, The virtuous Agnes hangs o'er Ellen's couch, Watching the moment of returning reason, That, haply, ere he breathes his last, the voice Of pardon yet may sooth him. Pro. Grant it, Heav'n. Con. I left him still'd in meek and holy sadness, To bear that parting scene: but much I fear For hapless Ellen. Her mind may ne'er regain its peaceful mood. Say, holy father! may they meet again? Or will not anguish rouse their souls once more To frantic agony? Pro. What Ellen's state? Con. I cannot call it frenzy, And yet she is not in her perfect mind. 'Tis no delirium, where the fever's rage Boils in the blood, and on the throbbing brain, Shapes images and scenes of spectred horror: 'Tis the mild error of the sense confus'd, That plays on cheated fancy: for she seems, All memory of later woe effac'd, Blissful as once ere bleak adversity Had ruffled youth's smooth current. Pro. Such things pass Man's narrow ken: Heav'n wills it. Con. Round her couch She fashions those, who sadly minister, To the gay partners of her innocent sports, Poor peasant girls, who cull in spring fresh flow'rs To wreath their brow, and mix the mirthful dance: And oft she calls Tortona's dame, who prays In silence o'er her, her own happy mother, List'ning with fond attention to the tune That late she taught her. Me, my mournful duties Have long familiar made with death-bed woe: And I have look'd on sinners when despair Scowl'd, as their eye glar'd fixedly upon me: But never have I witness'd such a scene; It quite o'ercomes me: life and death in one So strangely link'd, and all that's sweet and sad. Yetâhaply as we commune, holy father, All may be chang'd, and horrid images Usurp the mastery. Pro. Let us haste: our pray'rs May chase the fiend that haunts the bed of death. [Exeunt. Scene the Second an Apartment in the Convent. Agnes, Ellen on a Couch, attendant Monks, &amp;c. Agnes. Hush! rouse her not. Ellen. [in a delirium.] Soâenter in, I pray you, Strangers and all: it is but once a year We thus make holiday. Not soânot soâ You trip it awkardly, and mar the measure. The pipe's not out of tune, your step lacks ear. OhâI have scarcely breath at once to dance And teach the motion. [Ellen sinks exhausted. Provost and Confessor enter. Pro. [to Agnes.] Is all quiet with her? Agnes. Noâbut exhausted with the play of fancy, She peaceful sleeps. Pro. [considering her.] Quite breathless, or I err. Agnes. She but reposes: pray you, rouse her not. I dread what may ensue: a shock too sudden In painful horrors may unlodge her spirit. I have been us'd to these fantastic moods, Long have I watch'd her, and by tender cares Had smooth'd her passage to eternity: But this sad day hath all undone. Oh peace! Her eyes unclose, and bright their eager glare. Ellen. Hark! 'twas the shepherd's pipe! Away! away! hasteâto the green hills fly. I will no longer, while the dog-star flames, Doze in your sultry plains. The flat air lies Here, here, like lead upon me: it weighs down The soul's free wing. Haste, to the green hills, fly. How daintily the cool breeze fans my brow, Tangling my locks in many a mazy twine! Climb o'er yon mountain's peak, that props up Heav'n: Mind not that mass of snow: soâheave it off. Agnes. Compose thyself: here, on my bosom rest. Ellen. Speak lowâspeak very lowâonly in whispersâ You know not what it is. Stranger! that mass Which rock-like beetles o'er you, is loose snow. The mule-bell must not tinkle while it passes: Its very echo bursts it. Hail, once more, My native land! hail sweetest interchange Of all that chiefly gladdens eye and ear, Bright lakes, the pine-clad mount, and hill and dale! Hark! 'twas the Alpine lark that upward trill'd: Angels may hear it now: 'tis mute to earth: And oh that sound, most sweet at distance heard, The hidden waterfall, that in still moon-light Makes pleasant music to light-tripping elves. Thou peaceful hut! thou vine, that I have taught To clasp the rock: and thou my summer bow'r, Where underneath the green bough's canopy I sat, nor wish'd for the eagle's stretch of wing, That swept the upper world: oh never more Will I away. On you my eye first glanc'd, On you my dying look shall close in peace: And there the sod shall rise that hides poor Ellen. Pray for meâoh, I die. Agnes. A cold dew stands On her pale brow. I ne'er saw this before. Pro. 'Tis the fore-runner of approaching death. Sacristan enters. Sac. [to Agnes.] Lady! Alfonso now at life's last close, Thus speaks thro' me, that he doth feel assur'd Of Heav'nly mercy, if the death-bed blessing Of Ellen rest upon him. Canst thou ask it? Ellen will not deny thee. Pro. [bending over Ellen.] 'Tis, I fear, In vainâI traceâalas! no sign of life. Agnes. [kneels.] Oh Heav'n! in mercy yet awhile keep back The stroke of death, and to herself restore her: That one last word may breathe o'er dying Julian, Peace and forgiveness. Pro. Heav'n has heard thy voice: The recompence of virtue shall not fail, While God is judge above. Her pulse faint flutters. Hark! that low sigh, Ellen. [recovering.] I pray you, call me not From Heav'n's eternal rest! where have I been? Most lov'd, most honour'd lady! art thou near me? Then I shall die in peace. Butâwhereâwhere am I? Agnes. Beneath the convent roof with holy men. Ellen. [gazing around her.] Thanks, holy father: a poor peasant's child Can give no more. For thee, thou Saint on earth! I have a gift: it is the pictur'd form Of him, who never for one base as I am, Should have left thee, whom only angels equal. Where is it? Agnes. You resign'd it, gentle Ellen, To rescue me from death. Ellen. Then, take this kiss: Andâgive me thine. [They embrace. Agnes. EllenâI have a wish, A pray'r to thee. Ellen. Oh may my spirit pass In granting it! Agnes. We soon shall part for ever. Ellen. Not so. We meet in Heav'n. Agnes. Butâthere is oneâ Poor Julian. Ellen. What of him? Agnes. Will he be there? How shall he stand at the appointed day Before the judgment seat, if thy forgiveness Rest not upon him? Ellen. Oh that now he heard me. 'Twere now no sin to gaze upon this face, And hear the voice that pardons him. Agnes. And canst thou Endure the meeting? will it not o'erpow'r thee? He is beneath this roof. Will it not shock thee Once more to view him? not, as once, alas, In pride of manhood, but a contrite sinner Chastis'd by woe: and, such as now I view thee, Nigh unto death? yet peace at last would sooth him, Blest by thy pardon. Ellen. Heav'n has giv'n me strength. If he can look on Ellen, hither lead him. Say, Heav'n is merciful. I pray, delay not: My breath begins to fail. Be not long absent. Oh let me, on thy breast, in blessing thee Breathe out my spirit! Agnes. Grant me strength, ye saints! [Agnes goes out. Prior. [looking on Ellen.] Her head reclines again. Sure, life has left her. Alfonso led in by Agnes, and supported by the Monks. Alf. I pray you, mock me not. Is she not dead? Lift me, and let me gaze upon her face. [After long gazing on her. How calm! e'en so as when I first beheld thee. It speaks a soul that past in peace with all: And if thy placid lip has utterance lost, That look is like a blessing. Ellen. Agnes? Julian? Where are you? Alf. Prostrate at thy feet. Ellen. Oh, Julian, In secret oft I pray'd That thou might'st hear my blessing: Heav'n is gracious. Give me thy hand: I cannot see thy face, My eyes grow dim: thy honour'd hand, thou saint! Thus I unite you. [joining their hands.] Heav'n has heard my pray'r. NowâJulian, thou art blest. We meet in heav'n. [Ellen dies. Julian. Father of Mercy! thanks. Support me, Agnes! Oh that I ne'er had wrong'd thee! [Julian dies. Agnes. Julianâhear meâ His hand now quits my grasp. Farewell! farewell. [She kneels over them. Prior. Rise, virtuous mourner, rise! celestial peace Be thine! oh thou, who in severest trial, Firm in thyself, and faultless, shed'st the tear Lenient o'er human frailty! peace be thine! [To the Monks bending over the dead bodies. Brethren! o'er these the solemn requiem breathe! Then, duly in our cemetery place Till other burial claims: thou, [to Julian.] with thy sires, In sculptur'd tombs: and thou, [to Ellen.] poor child, with thine, Nameless beneath the grass-sod. Soon will pass Your mortal frames from sight: but long your fate Shall call down tears from many a stranger guest. Oft shall they sigh o'er thee, poor peasant girl! Whose earthly woes, unmerited, await Heav'n's blissful recompense. For thee, Alfonso! By thy example, warn the man of guilt, That Heav'n, who purified thy soul by woe, And chasten'd with sore wounds, may summon him, Flush'd from the banquet where sin ranks the guests, At once before the presence of his God.
