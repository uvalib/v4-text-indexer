      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Interior of the Ducal Palace at Barcelona. Second room at back seen through an archway. Don CÃ¦sar is seated in first room lost in thought. Perin watches him from inner room, then advances some steps. Perin. [Aside.] Again alone, and lost in reverieâ Sad reverie too, if looks reveal the heart! 'Tis even as I guessed: he is in love. [Don CÃ¦sar sighs. There was a sigh. Poor prince, he's touched indeed! I must have pity on him. I, who probe His malady so well, may find its cure. Don C. [Apart.] A being like herself! The fair outside Of woman, but without a woman's heartâ She to enslave me! 'Tis intolerable. Perin. [Aside.] Yes, 'tis of her whose beauty, cold as stone, Attracts from all the love she but disdainsâ 'Tis of Diana that he speaks. [Comes forward.] Good day, Most noble prince. Don C. [Who starts perplexed.] Who's there? Perin. If I intrude, Forgive me. Don C. [Rousing himself.] Perin! You're my countryman, And always welcome. Perin. You greet me cheerfully; a minute since I hardly thought you gay. But this is well; You can control yourself, and mask your heart. Don C. What do you mean? I scarcely understand you. Perin. Think twice, my lord, ere you evade me. Trouble That's told finds outlet, and, it may be, help; Will you confide in me? May I presume To say that you areâ [Hesitates. Don C. Perin, what? Perin. In love. Don C. In love! Perin. If I have eyes, if plain effects denote Their cause, and if where smoke is must be fire, I say you are in love. Don C. [Eagerly.] Have you been sent On a commission to me? Speak! Perin. On none Save that which my heart dictates. To be brief, I love you wellâa gallant prince, nor less Courteous than brave, and my dear countryman. Follow my counsel, and the goal you seek With fainting steps itself will come to meet you. Don C. [After a pause, taking his hand confidingly.] Perin, I trust you. Perin. [After looking cautiously round.] 'Tis conceded, then, That you're in love. With whom? Fenisa? Laura? No, no; 'tis with Diana, the duke's daughter, And heiress of this realm. Well, well, my prince, You share the fate of all men who behold That beauteous petrifaction. Don C. 'Tis enchantment, 'Tis sorceryâthis pride of hers that charms Even while it wounds. I would resist, but cannot. Perin. Pride can work wonders, sir. Of that anon. But tell me, have you loved her long? How chanced it? Don C. The rumour of Diana's singular Contempt of men, and of her father's wish That she should marry, reached me in my home. My cousins, the Count de Foix and the Prince of BÃ©arne, Eager to win this prize, would oft discuss Their chances at my father's court. I, heedless, Heard them at first, but, won by their persuasions, And curious to see this fair disdain, Came with them hither to the tournament. I saw Diana, and remained unmoved. True, she was fair, but though her mien was noble, It still repelled. My friend, I loved not then. Ere long the tournament began, and Fortune Smiled on my lance. Mine was the victor's lot In every conflict, mine the name the crowd Hailed with their shouts. Curious, I raised my eyes To where Diana, 'midst her ladies, sat, And then methought that even in her face Shone the approval beauty deigns to valour. Mark, that was the beginning. Perin. Good, I note you. Don C. A moment, and the bright look fled, replaced By chill indifference. Her coldness spurred me To further prowess. I performed that day Feats that surprised myself. From all the throng Loud acclamations burst, till Echo's self Pealed back and swelled them. But amidst this homage Still colder grew Diana's look. She sat, As might a statue in the din of crowds, Severe, immovable, but how majestic! At length her eye met mine, and my fixed gaze She answered with a look of utter scorn, As though she had demeaned herself to mark The pigmy deeds of men. I left the lists Incensed, confounded, but by some strange magic Enthralled past cure, and from that day to this Have been no more Don CÃ¦sar. Perin. 'Twas her pride, then, That woke your love. Don C. It was; my heart's a riddle! What should repel attracts; because her foot Spurns me, I kneel to kiss it; yes, her scorn, That ought to freeze me, kindles in my heart A fire of loveâI say a very fire, That, spite of shame and reason, still consumes me. Perin. Highly poetical! But, in plain terms, You're like the rest. The thing you have you prize not; The thing you cannot have, you therefore prize. It is unlucky, though, that you have set Your heart upon a statue. Better far Your choice had lit upon the lady's cousin, Donna Fenisaâay, or Laura. Both Are fair and amiable, flesh and blood, And find the world the pleasanter for men, Whose presence here Diana thinks the grand Mistake of Nature. Don C. Name her with respect. Perin. She is my gracious mistress, but still I may lament the flaw in her which mars What else were perfect. 'Tis said that in her girlhood Two princes wooed her. Policy, not love, Inspired their suit. With insight past her years She read their selfish aims, and thus conceived Contempt for all our sex. Now so extreme This mood has grown, she shuns, when possible, The sight of us; love-songs are discord to her; The pictures on her walls show Beauty flying Our loathed pursuit. 'Tis thus she spites the men, And of the women she would make Medusas Like to herself. Don C. What can be hoped then? Perin. Much. She's still a woman: women love to please. Don C. But she despises homage. Perin. Yes, because She surfeits on it. Prince, be ruled by me; Withhold from her the tribute others pay, Deny that food of praise which palls on her From its abundance. Keep her fasting, sir, Until she feels a woman's natural hunger:â That's love for man. Don C. [Surprised.] Perin! Perin. Think how you fared. Her pride subdued you. Be more proud than she, And conquer her. Don C. Proud, when I love! Perin. The more You merit hiding love. Don C. I cannot hide it. Perin. Then give her up. Don C. I cannot give her up. Perin. You're very reasonable. [Ironically. Don C. What must I do? Perin. I have already saidâ Be prudent, self-possessed, above allâcold. Don C. Cold! cold to her! Perin. It is your only chance. Don C. [After a pause of reflection.] I half believe it.â Come, then; I'll make the effort, though it rend me. Perin. I shall be near to aid. But mark me, prince, Let none suspect that I'm in league with you. At court here I am held a woman-hater, A boor, a foe to wedlock, and, in short, A convert to my lady's creed. 'Twas thus, When first I came here a poor gentleman, I won her smiles, became her secretary. Don C. [Archly.] Thou art a rogue. Perin. Say, sir, a politician. And yet, 'tis droll. There's here a little wretch, By name Floretta. Prince, she dotes on me, For no cause save the surliness I feign. There's hope again for you. At times her lip, So ripe and pouting, and her roguish eye, Tempt me to hug her, but then Prudence criesâ Caution!âand I mask fondness still with rudeness. Follow my cue, andâstay, here come the duke And your two cousins. Courage now; remember Your game's indifference. Thus alone you win. Don C. I am resolved: now let the game begin. Enter Don Diego, Don Luis, and Don Gaston. Perin is seen from time to time listening in the background. Don D. With sorrow, princes, I confess the slight Put on you by my daughter. I fondly hoped, Both for my people's good and for her own, That she would choose at last some worthy spouse; Yet she's inflexible, and but this day Avowed to me she'd meet the embrace of Death Rather than brook a husband's. Don L. Sir, despair not; Her strange delusion cannot long endure. Don G. [Complacently.] Impossible, let me but speak with her. Don D. I dare not give you hope. Methinks 'twere well, Though eight days of the tournament remain, That it were closed at once. Don L. Not so, my lord: I came to win your daughter. In eight days I with a scanty band have stormed a fort. Are women more impregnable than forts? Don D. Yes, sir; a fort yields to the assailer's will, A woman must be taken with her own. Don C. [With assumed indifference.] I grant, great duke, 'twas rather chance than love That brought me here; yet courtesy compels me To stay the appointed time. Don D. So be it then. The games shall still proceed. The boon you seek My daughter will oppose, but 'tis your due, And shall be granted. Don G. Thanks, sir. [Aside.] How I long For the sweet war of words. The enemy Who braves my sword is safer than the woman Who braves my tongue. Don D. I'll now prepare the princess For your approach, and shortly summon you. Don L. A thousand thanks, your highness. [Duke goes out. Don G. We've gained the outworks: now for the assault Upon the citadel. [To Don CÃ¦sar.] You're silent, cousin, Does your heart fail? Don C. [Carelessly.] Why should it fail? I'm with you, But 'tis the sport of the adventure tempts me; I care not for the prize. Don G. And she that prize! Not care for herâthe peerless, proud Diana! Then, man, thy youth is but a dress to hide A grey-beard's heart. 'Tis snow that fills thy veins; Thy sharp breath chills me, and I catch the ague Even while I talk. Come, Luis, I must needs Bask in the sun to warm me. Farewell, stoic! [Apart to Don Luis.] Let us discuss our plans. On one of us Her choice must fall. [Aside.] And if she be not blind, I know on whom. [To Don CÃ¦sar.] Adieu, my patriarch! [Goes out, laughing, with Don Luis. Don C. O happy moth, that flutters round the light Unconscious of his danger! I alone Know what attracts me fatal. I shall see herâ See the exalted look, the noble gestures That mark her separateâsingle 'mid her kind. Hope fails; my brain's bewildered. How behold her And feign indifference? From such a struggle What can I gain? Perin. [Hurrying forward.] Gain! why, a wayward woman, And Barcelona's throne. All will work well If you resolve it shall. Believe and conquer. No doubtful dallying. To the princess straight! Don C. Ah, friend, you do not feel! Perin. No more must you; At least not yet. Keep down your feelings, prince, As soldiers on forced marches keep down hunger. The fight won, they may eat and you may feel. Till then be coldâcold till, benumbed by frost, She begs for fire! Don C. Perin, thy words revive me. No more I falter. Victory's happy chance Lies by one path. I take it, and advance. [They go out. SCENE II. Drawing-room of Princess Diana. Donna Diana, Donna Fenisa, Donna Laura, seated; the two former engaged in embroidery, the last with a book. Donna D. Read on, dear Laura. Donna L. [Reading.] With love's fierce heat Apollo Daphne woos, Yet cannot melt her scorn, though god of light; Colder she flies as quicker he pursues, Till, lo! the laurel hides her from his sight. Donna D. 'Tis well expressed. Donna L. I think the style affected. Donna D. Exalted, rather, as befits the theme. Read on. Donna L. [Reading.] A noble heart doth vulgar bents despise, Rocklike it sees the waves of passion beat; In proud repose it doth itself suffice, And spurns love's vain illusion and deceit. Donna D. 'Tis excellent. Donna F. But stillâ Donna D. Still what? Donna F. 'Tis hard That we must hate love ere we know its name. Donna D. Would you be burnt before you shun the fire? Donna F. I'd run the risk; the danger might be great, But not so great asâ [Hesitates. Donna D. [Sternly.] Well? Donna F. As the enjoyment. Donna L. [Aside.] Imprudent girl! This to her face! Donna D. [Rising and speaking sternly.] Fenisa, Reflect another time to whom you speak. Rule your tongue better, girl, or else be silent: If not, avoid my presence. Make your choice. Enter Perin. You, Perin? Perin. How! your highness is displeased? Donna D. Displeased, sir, and alarmed. Perin. O, wherefore? Donna D. Ask not. Perin. [To Fenisa and Laura.] Speak, ladies! What has thus vexed my mistress? Donna L. O, a wordâ An idle word dropped by my sister here. Perin. What word? Donna L. [With assumed timidity.] She talked of love. Perin. [Pretending to be shocked.] Of love! Is it possible? But not in praise of it? Donna D. In praise of it; And in broad daylight, Perin. Perin. I'm amazed! Could she so far forget herself? Forgive me If I presume; the very name of love Throws me into a fever. Donna F. I but said What I must think,âthat we should prove love evil Ere we condemn it. Donna D. Foolish child, be warned By others' punishment, and so escape The scourge yourself. Twice was I sought in wedlock When a mere girl. What vows, what flatteries My suitors lavished! Had these counterfeits Been genuine coin, their tongues had squandered on me Whole mines of love. But then a question roseâ A mere chance questionâWhat would be my dowry? So many thousand ducats? Less by half, My father said. Then vanished suitor one; The next assumedâ('twas by mere accident He named the trifle)âthat our Barcelona Would in his quarrels fight or just or unjust? No, said my father. Straight my second suitor Fled like the first. To these men what was I? A human soul, quick with the breath of heaven? No; a mere title-deed to wealth and powerâ A poor appendage to the goods of fortune, Which should have been appendages to me. Donna L. They wronged you much. Donna D. They served me. From the first I saw their aims. They but confirmed in me The love I felt before for single life, And all the charms of high philosophy. Enter Floretta hurriedly. Flo. Your father, lady, with the princes comes. Donna D. [Aside.] What! with the princes? Though he threatened this, I scarce believed him. Donna F. [To Floretta.] So Don Gaston comes? Flo. Yes. Donna L. And Don Luis? Flo. With Don CÃ¦sar, too! Donna D. [To Perin.] Am I to be invaded thusâdeprived Of privacy and freedomâdoomed, perhaps, To hateful marriage! Perin. Princess, none would dare To force your hand. They do but mean to reason. Submit, then. Can their puny arguments Shake in an hour your firm philosophy, The work of years? O, fear not. Donna D. [Who, after taking a few steps in meditation, returns.] Let them come, And learn whom they assail. [She sits by the table, takes a book and reads. Her air is resolute and noble. Donna L. [Apart to Fenisa.] We soon shall see Don Luis, then; he has a noble bearing. Donna F. None of the three would come amiss to me. Flo. [Aside to Perin, pleasantly.] Good morning, Perin. Perin. [Sharply.] You've said that before, To-day. Flo. What then? Perin. There's no need to repeat it. Flo. Why should you be so sullen? While the princes Engage our mistress, take a turn with me. Perin. A turn with you! For what? Flo. For cheerful gossip. We're all so silent here, I soon shall lose The use of speech. Perin. Pray that you may, for then You'll be endurable. Flo. You wretch! you bear! [Goes out indignantly. Perin. How charming is she! Bear's an ugly name; But on that rosy mouth abuse itself Should be stopped but with kisses. If I daredâ But no; beneath the rule of our strict goddess, A kiss were sacrilege. Well, patience! patience! I have a score against her. She shall pay it. [Goes out, with a grimace at Donna Diana. Enter Don Diego. Don D. [At door.] Princes, this way. [The Princes enter, one after the other, Don CÃ¦sar last. Donna Diana rises to meet her father. The Princes make a low bow to Donna Diana and her Cousins, which all the ladies return. Donna Diana, however, bows but slightly, then averts her face. Don C. [Aside, with evident emotion.] Enchantress! Can I gaze Upon her and dissemble? Don D. Daughter! Donna D. Sir, I wait your pleasure. Don D. 'Tis that you receive These princes with due hospitality. My honoured guests, with reason they complain That you avoid them. Donna D. Father, to the point. Let me say briefly thisâmy will to yours Must be subservient. I recoil from marriage More than from death. But as you gave me life, 'Tis yours to take. Determine as you please. Don D. You misconceive me, child. 'Tis not of marriage I speak. Love must be free, but courtesy Is due to all. Explain, then, to the princes That your philosophyânot prideâimpels you To shun their suit. Maintain your strange opinions With suavity and reason. Of my daughter I ask no more: she cannot grant me less. [Goes out. Donna D. [After a pause.] Speak, gentlemen, what is it you require? Don L. Princess, your confidence. If none among us May win your love, then teach us by what arts Love may be conquered. [Diana signs gravely to them to be seated, and sits down. Don G. Say for what transgression Is poor love driven from paradiseâthy breast. Looking on thee, it seems unnatural; And, wouldst thou look on us and weigh our merits, 'Twould seem impossible. [Diana listens with an amused expression, which at length changes to contempt. Don C. I, too, would hear Your reasons, princess, though I half incline Already to your cause. I love my freedom, And you may soon persuade me, should you deign, To think a single life the best of fates. [Diana becomes attentive, looks at him with some little astonishment, then turns her head quickly away. Donna F. [Apart to Laura.] How liked you that? Donna L. [Apart to Fenisa.] Amazingly; he's proud, And therefore dangerous. Don G. Silence for the princess. Donna D. [With grave dignity.] Since I must speak, I'll nothing hide. First, think how short is life. What are life's worthy aims? You'll tell meâVirtue, Wisdom, the general good. Now, if I ask The sages and all history what most Wars with these aims, they answer, that poor weakness Born of the sensesâlove; that childish impulse Which children make a god. Seen in itself, Love moves my laughter, seen in its effects, Mirth becomes terror. What has love made man? A tyrant. And what woman? Why, a slave. Add to all this the vices that beset The path of love, as flattery, deceit, Strife, jealousy, revenge, and can you wonder That I recoil? [A short pause. My name's Diana, and my blood is royal. I would be worthy both. Know, therefore, princes, That love is alien to me. Your esteem I prize: your suit I must perforce refuse. A different planet ruled us at our births, And we are wide apart as world from world! [She bows graciously. Donna L. [To Fenisa.] It sounds well. Donna F. So it ought; 'tis only sound. Don G. [Eagerly.] Let me speak, princes. [Embarrassed by the look of Donna Diana. Hem! I think, Don Luis, I'll leave the cause to you. I shall reserve My speech for greater need. When I do speak, Then let her tremble. Don C. [Seriously.] Pray proceed, Don Luis. I've nought to urge; the princess has convinced me. [Diana looks at him with astonishment. Don L. Then, princess, hear me. Those evils you denounce spring not from love, For love is generous, but from selfish passion. You quote the sages; I the human heart, Which tells that, in all periods, love has reigned Supreme o'er man. And, pardon me, it seems That you distrust your cause, withdrawing thus From love's assault. If you have courage, show it. Let us encounter you in pleasant warfare, Let all be lawful that a knight may ask, A lady grant. Should a true heart subdue you, Even your defeat were gain, and if you conquer, Be named Diana the Invincible, And we will bear your fame from pole to pole. Donna F. [Apart to Laura.] Most fair! most reasonable! Donna L. [Surprised, apart to Fenisa.] She consents. Donna D. [Rising.] You wish it so? Then I accept your challenge. War is declared. To-night we hold a masque; There be the conflict tried. Use every art That cunning prompts, and ply me with all weapons That tongue or eye can furnish. I will meet you. Don L. Never did richer prize or greater peril Engage a soldier. Friends, let each one show That he is worthy of so fair a foe. [He bows profoundly to the ladies, then goes out. Don G. Princess, prepare yourself for my attack. You'll need your wits. Howe'er the stars decide, I do not quit this court without my bride. [Bows, and goes out. Diana gives a light laugh, and remains standing, as if in abstraction. Donna L. [Apart to Fenisa.] The game proceeds. Donna F. [Apart to Laura.] It interests the players; But 'tis dull sport, methinks, to lookers on. Don C. [Rising, and speaking aside with suppressed emotion.] Now love befriend me! Donna L. [To Fenisa.] Hush! Don CÃ¦sar speaks. Don C. [Approaching Diana gravely.] 'Twould ill befit me, princess, as a knight, To shun this mimic war. I cannot vie With others in their transports, but still hope My homage, though less ardent, may be welcome. Donna D. [Looking up surprised.] What is't you say? Don C. I think of love as you doâ That 'tis degrading, enervating, vain. Indeed, I long have held your own opinions, But still more strictly. I can neither love Nor bear to be beloved. Donna D. [Forcing a smile.] Is there much danger, Think you, of that? Don C. O, none. That's none to me. The most seductive charms that woman boasts Would leave me cold. But what if I should rouse In her a passion I could ne'er requite? That were unjust, indeed. I'm therefore frank. Donna D. Why do you pay me court then? Don C. To evince My deep esteem. It were uncourteous To stand aloof when others proffer homage. Donna D. There's no love in the case then? Don C. [With great gravity.] Not the least. Donna D. [Astonished.] Would you not marry? Don C. Some day, for convenience. My court a mistress needs, my throne an heir. Yes, I may take a wife, but not for love. Donna D. [Apart to Fenisa.] You hear the coxcomb. Is he not absurd? Donna F. [Apart to Diana.] He's proud. Donna D. [Apart to her.] Say arrogant. Why, 'twould appear He came here to defy me! [Apart to Laura.] Were't not sport To make this fop, spite of himself, enamoured? Donna L. That might be dangerous. Donna D. To whom? Donna L. To you. You are but human. Donna D. What! Do you pretend That I could stoop to loveâto love for him? I, whom prayers move not, vanquished by disdain! Laura, you are a greater fool than he. Donna L. Well, you are warned. Donna D. [Aside, excitedly.] I'll punish this vain pride. [She turns pleasantly to Don CÃ¦sar, who stands as if abstracted. I rejoice, prince, to hear your sentiments, And thank you for them. Don C. [Still seeming absent.] Why? Donna D. Because with you I can converse in freedom, with no risk That you should love me. Don C. If for this you thank me, I shall deserve your thanks. Donna D. [Laughing.] Good, very good. Perin enters, observed by Diana. Don C. Still, to yourself take heed. The firmest woman May overrate her firmness when with man; Deem me not rude then, but considerate, In warning you from peril. If I catch The slightest sign of love, I must avoid you. Donna D. Avoid me! Don C. Not for my sake, for your own. Donna D. [Aside.] Insufferable, matchless vanity! [Aloud, sarcastically.] You could not be so cruel! Do not fear. Don C. We understand each other then? Donna D. [Rather excitedly.] Most fully. You may go satisfied.âPerin! [Perin approaches her quickly and officiously. She whispers a few words to him. Don C. Princess, Until to-night, farewell. [He makes a serious bow, which Diana returns. He then retires slowly but stops short. Donna D. [With irritation, apart to Laura.] You shall yet see him In love to madness. Donna L. O poor wretch, he's doomed If you take arms! [Apart to Fenisa.] 'Twill happen otherwise I think. Then we may find a chance. Donna F. Heaven grant it. Donna D. Not gone, prince? Don C. No, but going. Donna D. [Ironically.] Really going! Have you the heart? Will you not change your mind? Think twice, and fall in love. Don C. [Quietly.] What then would happen? Donna D. [Haughtily.] Your prompt and ignominious rejection. Perin, a word with you. [Speaks to him apart.] Good morning, prince. [She bows somewhat disdainfully, and goes out followed by Donnas Laura and Fenisa. Perin. [To Don C.] Well done! Well done! I'm proud of you. Don C. O Perin, I love her more than ever! To disguise it Is past my power. My resolution melts, My strength forsakes me. [Leans on a chair for support. Perin. Had another sworn Don CÃ¦sar spoke thus, I had not believed it. What! when you've fired her prideâforced her to parley! Even now she bade me follow her to take Some weighty charge. I'll wager it concerns you. Keep then in doors, and you shall quickly learn Her plan of battle. Why to fail were monstrous, Her game exposed, her tactics in your hand! Good, good, you rally! Courage, prince! [Goes out. Don C. He breathes A second life into me. I'll not yield. No flight! I win or perish on the field! [Goes out opposite side from Perin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. State Apartments in the Ducal Palace. An Inner Room open. Enter Perin, who looks around cautiously, sees Don CÃ¦sar outside, dressed for the masque, and beckons to him. Don C. [Entering.] Well, friend, what tidings have you? Perin. Rare ones, rare ones! My system answers to perfection. Don C. Well? Perin. Her little brain's already turned: she's bent To make you mad with love. In fine, her mind Is firmly set to drive you out of yours. Don C. What would she gain by that? Perin. Gain! the delight Of bringing you distracted to her feet, And thus requiting your disdain with hers. Now is't not sport, 'tis on my help she builds? But she must be at hand. Prepare yourself To meet her blandishments, and for heaven's sake Remember all are feigned; so spoil her witchcraft. Be cold; if need be, rude. Don C. Will the scheme answer? Perin. Will fish take bait? 'Twill tame her. Quickly then She'll bow before her conqueror, for love That springs from vanquished pride has few gradations, But goes crescendo. If at ten o'clock She but pretends to love, and you respond not, Eleven will see her love in earnest; twelve, If you keep firm, beholds her almost crazed With torment and with longing; and at one She's on her knees: you've but to order bride-cake. I do not jest: these are true tactics, prince. Don C. O 'tis a fierce ordeal. She all softness, Can I be stern? [Perin makes a sigh of impatience.] Don't fear, I'll not relapse. Perin. 'Tis bravely said. [Then confidentially and emphatically.] Now for reward, I'll tell you A scheme of hers. 'Tis at this masque the custom That every lady takes a knight by lot. Each fair one has a ribbon of some colour Which she conceals; each knight a colour names, And she who has it to that knight belongs For all the masque. He's freeânay, more, he's bound To woo her favour by all flattering arts. No less is looked for. On her side, the beauty Must show like courtesy, and grant her knight All fair requests. Now guess her first manÅuvre. She with her counsins has contrived it so That youâwhatever colour you may chooseâ Fall to her share. Well, see you not in that The chance she gives you? [Looking off.] Hist, she comes! Don C. [Aside, disturbed.] She comes! Perin. Sport round the light, prince; mind you fly not in it. [Hurries into inner room. Don C. I tremble still. I cannot meet her yet. [Follows Perin into inner room. Enter at side Donna Diana, Donna Laura, Donna Fenisa, and Floretta, according to their rank, in rich ball dresses. Don CÃ¦sar and Perin, in the saloon at back, are visible at intervals to audience. Donna D. [With pleasant liveliness to her cousins.] So shall it be; let there be no mistake: Choose whom you please, but leave to me Don CÃ¦sar. 'Tis easily arranged: I've all the colours. Donna F. And so have I. Donna L. And I. Flo. I, too, have all. Donna D. [Complacently to herself.] Presumptuous fool! thou shalt not now escape! A thousand meshes will I weave around thee. Donna F. [Apart to Laura.] I take Don Gaston's colour. Donna L. You are welcome. We will divide the spoil, as sisters should. I choose Don Luis. Flo. [Who has overheard them, merrily.] I don't envy you. My part's allotted. Perin, thou art caught, At least for once. Donna D. [Who has seated herself, observing Perin.] Perin! Perin. [Quickly and dutifully approaching her.] What would your highness? [They converse apart. Donna D. [Smiling.] Have you yet seen the man? Perin. I have, and tried To sound him. Donna D. Well; think you he can resist? Perin. Yes; as the oak the zephyr. If he fall, He must be undermined. Donna D. He shall be so. The victory ours, count on five thousand ducats. Perin. Five thousand ducats! I'll do more than man With such a hope. He's tottering already. Donna D. Once prostrate, I will pay his scorn with scorn. Don C. [Who has overheard her, aside.] Ah cruel one! Nay, then, I cast off fear And turn to action. [Advances some steps. Perin. [To Donna Diana.] See, see, the foe! I'll fall upon his rear. [He draws himself somewhat back, giving Don CÃ¦sar a sign to come nearer. Donna D. [To her cousins.] Be on your guard.âTo the saloon, Floretta. See that all's rightly ordered. Flo. Yes, your highness. [She passes close by Perin, and makes him a pleasant courtesy, to which he replies by a surly grimace. She then goes into saloon at back. Don C. [Coming forward to Donna Diana with a grave bow.] I am first, it seems, In this night's duties. Donna D. [With slight raillery, but amiably.] You are most exact; Surprisingly for one who shrinks from love. Don C. Where the heart's free, we're stricter in respect. Donna D. [With increased amiability.] Trust me, I don't mistake your courtesy; But still you have my thanks. Don C. I don't deserve them. I'm punctual by habit. Donna D. [Coaxingly.] Must I think, then, You'd no wish to oblige me? Don C. [Off his guard, and with involuntary feeling.] Who could see you, And not feel that? Perin. [Apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] A thousand times too warm. [Apart to Diana.] He's melting fast. [Apart again to Don CÃ¦sar.] Ice, ice, I say. Donna D. [Apart to Perin.] What did you whisper to him? Perin. Only that graciousness like yours deserved A fit return. Donna D. [Apart to him.] Quite right. [Aloud, and very confidingly to Don CÃ¦sar.] I owe you, prince, Some reparation for harsh words to-day. At first I thought you rude; but now I see, Like me, you're frank by nature. It is strange How much our views and feelings are alike! I've shunned men hitherto; but you, methinks, Might almost reconcile me to your sex. [Donna Fenisa signs to Donna Laura, who smiles and lays her finger on her lips. Don C. Princess, beware! Donna D. [Surprised.] Beware! Don C. Of the first impulse To look on me too kindly. Who can tell Where it might lead you? Donna D. Where? Don C. I know not. Still, Great ends have small beginnings: the rill spreads Into the river, the neglected spark Into a fire; and so your kindness Might grow (mind, I say might)âmight grow to love. Donna D. [Archly.] What if it should? Don C. You would repent of it. Donna D. [In a bland tone.] Are you quite sure of that? Don C. It must be so, Since I should still remain indifferent. Donna D. [Mortified.] You're candid, sir; most candid. Don C. Very like. I never studied falsehood. Perin. [Laughing aside.] Then you had The gift from nature. Apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] Bravo, prince! that told. Donna L. [Apart to Fenisa.] Heavens! what a man! Donna F. [Apart to Laura.] Delicious! I could eat him. Donna D. [Apart to Perin.] Perin, what can I do? The creature's iron. Perin. Get up the furnace to white heat, and melt him. Donna D. [Resuming her former pleasant manner.] Don CÃ¦sar, modesty is scarce your fault. 'Tis usual for men to feign some deference When they contend with ladies. Don C. How, your highness? Contend! Did I not utter your own doctrine, That love is childish, wisdom's direst foe; The source of man's injustice, woman's bondage, Of flattery, folly, strife, deceit, revenge? These were your very words. I could not mend them. [Bows. Perin. [Aside.] Excellent! He's a prodigy. [Fenisa and Laura signify their astonishment by gestures to each other. Donna D. [Suppressing her vexation.] As to love, We may have gone too far, prince. Don C. I'm so cold By nature that I never go too far. Perhaps your highness may. [Significantly. Donna D. I! [Aside.] Insolent! Though it cost life, I'll have thee at my feet. [Music heard in saloon at back. Flo. [Who re-enters hastily.] All is prepared, your highness, and the princes Even now approach. Donna D. [Still heated, apart to her cousins.] Look to the colours; mind That you mistake not. Donna L. We'll take heed. Donna F. [Attempting to restrain her laughter.] O, surely. Donna D. [Sharply.] Why do you simper, child? It misbecomes you. Perin. [Apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] Prince, I congratulate you. Don C. [Apart to him.] O my friend, My tortures but commence. Perin. [Apart to him.] Think of the prize; Let that sustain you. Enter Don Luis and Don Gaston in splendid ball dresses. They are led in by the Master of the Ceremonies. Several Court Servants and Musicians follow, whom the Master of the Ceremonies shows to their places. Don L. [Bowing profoundly to Donna Diana.] Princess, 'twixt hope and fear I hither come To take my part: may Fortune smile on me. Don G. [Bowing to Diana.] No fear have I: she smiles on the stout heart. Donna D. [With pleasant composure.] You know what duties and what privileges This masque accords to you. The dame you win Expects your court, and tenders you her favour, Each of you has a lover's privilege For this night only. Come, demand your colours! Don L. [Advancing to centre.] Fortune is queen of this solemnity: I therefore choose her favourite colourâgreen. Donna L. [Who with some confusion selects and displays a green ribbon.] Here, then, is green: I am with you, Don Luis. Don L. [Aside.] 'Sdeath, I have missed the prize! [Rising and approaching Donna Laura.] I can't complain, Gaining so fair a partner. [He kneels to Donna Laura, who attaches the green ribbon to his dress. Flourish of trumpets. The Master of the Ceremonies conducts them to Donna Diana, who gives each of them a mask. They retire and sit.] Don G. [Advancing to centre.] Fortune's self Is slave to Love. I ask Love's colourâred. Donna F. [Nervously selecting and displaying a red ribbon.] Prince, I have red; you fall then to my share. Don G. [Aside.] Confusion, I have lost my aim! [Aloud.] Believe me most proud and happy. [Approaching Donna Fenisa.] Lady, Chance thus fulfils Love's dear behests: She gives me you. [He kneels to her: same business as before in the case of Luis and Laura. Flo. Now, Perin, 'tis your turn. Perin. Mine! Are you mad? Flo. [To Diana.] May it please your highness, Perin Won't draw his colour. Donna D. Perin, none are free From this night's duties. You must e'en comply. Perin. I play the lover! The mere thought is wormwood. Must I indeed? Is there no help for it? [Donna Diana expresses dissent. Well, since I hate love as I hate the fiend, If I must choose at all, give me the colour Of the fiend's liveryâblack. Flo. [Selecting and displaying a black ribbon with comical confusion.] O, here is black. Who would have thought it? You belong to me. Come, take your love-knot. [He kneels with feigned disgust as she approaches him and fastens the black ribbon on his dress. Flourish of trumpets. Perin. [Aside.] Captivating witch! She little knows my heart: I still must hide it. [Floretta gives him his hat. He speaks aloud gruffly.] What next? Flo. I'm waiting for you. Perin. O, come on! [They go to Donna Diana, who gives them their masks. They then place themselves near Don Luis and Don Gaston. Don C. [Rising and going to centre.] 'Twas fit that they whose hearts are slaves to love, Should choose before me. I select the colour Of equanimity and freedomâwhite. Donna D. That's strange. White is the absence of all colour, And, thinking none would take it, I reserved White for myself; but you have foiled me, prince! [Rising with dignity.] Here's white; you must content yourself with me. Don C. [Aside.] Now then, hold fast, my heart. [Diana approaches him; all rise; Don CÃ¦sar kneels to her; she fastens the white ribbon on his dress. Triple flourish of trumpets. She then gives him a mask, taking one herself. Subdued music is now heard; and at intervals, from inner room, through which guests are seen occasionally to pass and repass. All carry masks; the men have colours. Don CÃ¦sar, with visible emotion, leaves Diana's side as the other princes and her cousins approach her. Donna D. The couples now retire to the saloon. The guests assemble, and the sport begins. Let Love reign free, and Fortune favour all! [Don Gaston and Don Luis retire with their ladies to the inner saloon, preceded by the Master of the Ceremonies. Perin and Floretta follow; then musicians; a louder strain of music from the inner saloon. Don CÃ¦sar and Donna Diana still stand at some distance from each other. Donna D. [Aside.] Now, then, to test his strength! [Aloud]. Your arm, Don CÃ¦sar. You fail in your attentions. Does it cost So vast an effort to make love to me? Remember, 'tis required by the occasion. [Don CÃ¦sar, visibly suppressing his emotion, approaches her. She takes his arm. A man of wit should better play his part. [She turns from him. Don C. O princess! Donna D. What's the matter? [She lays her right hand on his arm.] Silent still? Nay, this indifference offends me. What! Can you not feign your part? Have you no talent, Even as an actor? Don C. Words are easy, lady, When love is feigned. 'Tis the reality That keeps me dumb. Donna D. [In a very gentle tone.] What must I think of this? You love me, then? [She draws his hand to her. Don C. [With the utmost emotion, not daring to look up.] Why ask? What power but Love's Could make me tremble thus? Donna D. [With agreeable surprise, still retaining his hand.] Do you not jest? Is this the truth? Don C. Truth from my very soul. Donna D. [Firmly, but with sympathy.] You said but now You were incapable of love. Don C. I spoke Before this fatal shaft struck home. Donna D. [With a winning smile.] What shaft? Don C. The touch of thy fair hand, that thrills my heart Even to its core. Princess!âDiana!âhear me! Donna D. [Aside.] I triumph, then. [Turning to him pleasantly.] Prince, you deceive yourself. Love you, indeed? Don C. [Loosing all self-control.] You look on me, and doubt! How can words paint the longing that enchains My senses, saps my peace, and threats my reason. 'Twas your severity first roused my passion, Yet strengthened me to hide it; but your sweetness Has all subdued me. As when snows fall thick Upon some mountain ridge, and there congealed, Assume the shape of towers and battlements, That glitter in the sun and look defiance, Yet 'neath the breath of summer thaw to floodsâ So melts the frozen mantle of my pride Before thy smiles, and shows the bare, bare heart Which owns thee, needs thee, seeks thy quickening life, Or yields its own. Pronounce; I'm at thy feet! [He throws himself at her feet, and kisses her hand impetuously. Donna D. [Thrusting him off, and tearing herself away.] Back, back, presumptuous man! What, art thou he Who could not feel love, nor endure it? Who, safe thyself, must needs warn me of peril? Peril from thee, who some day might submit To marry for convenience! Hence! In me Insulted Woman triumphs over Man! Don C. [Aside.] Fond heart, thou hast betrayed me! Calmness, calmness! Donna D. [Sternly and proudly.] You had due warning, yet you dared to wage This conflict with me; shallow fop, with me! Don C. [With feigned astonishment.] Stay; does your highness jest, or is this serious? Donna D. I do not jest with you, poor love-sick dupe! Don C. Dupe! love-sick! Then 'tis serious. What, you thought I was in love in earnest? [Rises.] Ha! ha! ha! [He bursts into seemingly irrepressible and repeated laughter. O female vanity! So great a mind, And yet so soon beguiled! In love! No, princess; I cannot change so easily. In love! Had it been possible, I'd rather died Than owned such weakness. What! a few soft words, A suppliant postureâcommon arts like these Thus to delude you! Surely you forget These duties were imposed by the occasion. Donna D. [Thoroughly confused.] How now! What's this? Don C. You bade me to dissemble, And I obeyed. Donna D. You but dissembled? [Aside.] No, Impossible. Don C. Congratulate me, princess; You said I had no talent as an actor. Donna D. All, then, was feignedâthe trembling voice, the words, The shaft that struck you home! Don C. All feigned, believe me. Surely your penetration should have guessed it. Donna D. [Absently.] What say you? [Aside.] Not to see it! Was I blind? [Aloud.] Well, prince? Don C. [Looking at her sharply.] I scarcely understand your highness. Donna D. [Aside.] I must compose myself! [Rallying herself with a great effort, and addressing him gaily.] Your highness, I confess, Played your part well. But, pardon me, I half Suspected you were acting all the time. Don C. [With assumed frankness.] I thought you did. So, to encourage me, You acted too. Your scorn was well put on, So was your triumph; look, tone, gesture perfect! Talk not of me; your acting was sublime. Donna D. [Aside.] More mockery! Patience! [Aloud.] No prince, you're the master, And, as dissembling seems your gift, continue The harmless folly; feign to love me still. [Puts on her mask. I own I like your wit and polished bearing, And your pretence of passion charms me more Than others' truth. [Taking his arm, and playfully trying to lead him off.] Come, come, resume the attack. Don C. Excuse me, princess. Donna D. Why, what risk is there In this mere sport? Don C. The greatest riskâthe risk That you may love me. Donna D. [With playful tenderness.] And would that misfortune Be unsupportable? Don C. [Sternly.] I know of none I so much dread. I think the danger serious. Have you not praised my wit and bearing, owned That my pretence of passion charms you more Than others' earnest? Are these sentiments So far from love? Donna D. [With a burst of rage.] Yes, sir, as far apart As is your insolence from modesty; To guard myself from chance of further insult, I give you leave of absence. [Takes off her mask. Don C. [Aside, uneasily.] She's at bay. I've gone too far. [Aloud.] Still, are you not expected To join the ball? Your absence may offend. Donna D. [Still incensed.] Mine is the fault, be mine the blame. Withdraw. Don C. [Concealing his embarrassment.] And am I then released from all my duties? Donna D. When I pronounce you free, you are so. Leave me. Don C. [After a pause, with suppressed anxiety.] Accept my thanks, then, for this gracious favour, For such I deem it. Heaven be with your highness. [Goes out. Donna D. [Violently excited.] Do I dream? Can it be possible? Scorned, laughed at, Defeated by a man! No, not defeated. There must be some way to subdue him, else My sex is shamed in me! Enter Perin, hastily from inner room. Perin. May it please your highness To join the masque? Your absence is remarked. Donna D. [Sinking into a chair.] O Perin, I'm unwell. Perin. [Sympathetically.] Unwell! Good heaven! [Aside.] Oh this is glorious! [Aloud, looking round.] But where's Don CÃ¦sar? Gone for the doctor, is he? Donna D. Silence, Perin. I'm very ill. Perin. Indeed! you look so, madam. [Runs to table for a phial. Do try a little hartshorn. [Offers phial. Donna D. Hartshorn! Folly! What good can hartshorn do? Perin. I'm quite alarmed. What is it ails your highness? Speak! Donna D. [In a weak voice.] A tightness About my heart. I suffer such oppression. Perin. [Feigning great anxiety, and bustling.] Tightness about your heart! Oppression! O! Time's precious here. I'll to the doctor straight. [Pretends to be going. Donna D. Stay; would you drive me mad? 'Tis outraged pride Alone that moves me thus. Don CÃ¦sar yet Is unsubdued. Perin. [Aside.] O, it works rarely. [Aloud.] Wondrous! Are you still bent to humble him? Donna D. I am, I'd give my Principality to see him In earnest at my feet, and bid him, then, Despairing die there. Perin. Very right he should. Donna D. Listen to me. I'm told this man of flint Has one weak pointâhe's sensible to music. [Perin claps his hands. Now I shall need your help. 'Tis daylight still. Hold him awhile in talk while I go forth Into the private park where you shall bring him. Perin. I understand. Donna D. There will I take my lute. I do not play amiss. Perin. Amiss your highness! To ravishment. Donna D. Say he can hear me there In secretâmind, in secret. Perin. [Affecting delight.] Good! Donna D. Because None are allowed to break on my seclusion. Perin. That will more tempt him. Donna D. [Who advances a few steps aside, Perin listening.] Meantime, I'll put on My choicest dress and give these slighted charms All aids that fair attire supplies to beauty. Perin. Well planned indeed! Donna D. [Smiling.] You overheard me then? Perin. A witching dress, some dress to make him giddy And take away his breath! And, then the lute! His eye and ear assailed at once! He's done for. Donna D. Enough; I go. The dearest bliss I crave Is to behold him in the dustâmy slave! [Goes out. Perin. A rare device! If I were not at hand To warn him, the poor Prince were lost indeed. O woman! what a brain hast thou for mischief! [Goes out. SCENE II. Grounds of Palace. A garden bench. Enter Floretta and Perin meeting. Flo. So you are here, sir! This is gallantry, The very model of a knight are you Who thus desert your lady. Perin. Where's Don CÃ¦sar? Flo. What's that to you or me? Where are your duties? I'm faint; why don't you lead me to a seat? [Throws herself on garden bench. I'm feverish; why don't you ply my fan? [He fans her violently. I am a woman and need compliments; Why don't you bend o'er me and praise my beauty. Perin. I have no gift for lying. Flo. Then acquire it. Perin. What! Would praise please you if you knew it false? Flo. 'Twere better than no praise. [Rising, and coming forward with him. Perin. To be deceived? Flo. Pleasant deceit charms more than ugly truth. Perin. [Aside.] I can't resist her frankness. Roguish gipsy. [Aloud.] Dear, dear Floretta! Flo. Well? Perin. If you but knew Your power o'er me, the witchery of those eyesâ Flo. Do you mean this?â Perin. The honey of those lips? Flo. How know you they are sweet? Perin. They look so. Flo. Looks Are oft deceptive. Perin. Taste is not; Floretta! [About to kiss her, he checks himself and speaks aside. Stay; I'm too rash. The Princess may not love, And should she not, my love might cost my place. [Turns Floretta round and throws himself carelessly upon garden bench. Well; will that do? Flo. What do? Perin. Why the pretence Of love you asked for. I have done my best? Flo. Was all pretence then? Perin. Surely. Come, Floretta, Cast off this folly, emulate our mistress, Pray for the timeâthe golden timeâwhen love And marriage both shall cease, when men and women Shall dwell at different corners of the world, And never meet again. Earth then will see Its happiest generation! Flo. [Walking up to him significantly.] And its last. Forget not that. If men be all like you, That generation cannot come too soon. [Goes out indignantly. Perin. [Laughing.] Poor child, poor child! Well, I must live in hope To make her due amends. Now for Don CÃ¦sar! Enter Don CÃ¦sar. Don C. Perin! Perin. So prince, more news for you. Don C. What news? Perin. Be firm a little longer, and you triumph. Don C. Friend, You mock me. Never will that haughty spirit Stoop to man's love! Perin. Did you expect the fortress To yield without a siege. Maintain it bravely, And on my life she falls; she must. Don C. Why must? Perin. Because, instead of fighting under cover She's rash and plans a sally. In plain words, Equipped with all the dazzling aids of dress, Her lute upon her arm, she seeks the garden, And bids me bring you there in secret. Don C. So! Perin. That you may see her beauty in a garb Would fire an anchorite, and hear her lute That would enchant a stone. Don C. Are you mad, Perin, To drive me full into this siren's toils? She plays divinely; I should ne'er resist The spell of music. Perin. Then don't listen to it. [Listens to distant sounds of music. O, she's already gingling. Don C. Silence! Silence! [A prelude of several instruments is heard from garden, then a lute only. Entrancing sounds! 'Tis she! Perin. Up, up, Don CÃ¦sar! The foe is in the field. Like your great namesake, Go, see, and conquer. [They walk a few paces: the lute sounds again. Don CÃ¦sar stands absorbed.] On, prince! on to victory! [Perin drags him forcibly off. SCENE III. Private park of the palace. A garden, planned in an arbitrary but ingenious style, and rich in contrasting objects. A group of trees on each side. To the left, statues and beds of flowers; to the right, a bower of roses with seats. Time, near sunset. Music is heard behind the scenes. Towards the end of the symphony enter Floretta. She looks around, then goes out at back. Enter Donna Diana in an ideal and very exquisite dress, a coronet on her head. She carries a lute. Donna Laura and Donna Fenisa follow, with other instruments. Re-enter Floretta, meeting them. Donna D. [To Floretta.] Have you observed Don CÃ¦sar here? Flo. No, madam. Donna D. Watch. Should he enter, tell me instantly. Flo. I will, your highness. [Aside.] There's some mystery here. [Goes to back. Donna D. [To Laura.] Though he were granite, I would make him bend. Donna L. That dress must take effect. [Donna Laura and Fenisa enter the bower. Donna F. [Aside.] 'Tis very hard That we should be detained thus from our partners. Flo. [Approaching hastily.] Don CÃ¦sar comes, your highness, also Perin. Donna D. Sit quickly, cousins, and, as we arranged, Begin as he approaches. Flo. [Aside.] I'm not curious; But I should dearly like to know their plot. Enter Don CÃ¦sar and Perin. Perin. [To Don CÃ¦sar.] Be calm. Forewarned, forearmed. Don C. [Gazing on Diana.] How can I see her, Arrayed in all her splendour, and be calm? Perin. [Apart to him.] Be firm, or you are lost. [Diana's music is begun with her cousins. Don C. 'Tis vain to reason. Though I foresee my doom, the lovely sorceress Still draws me on. [Advancing towards Diana. Perin. [Following him, and speaking apart to him in a low tone.] You'll drive me frantic; stay, You've heard enough. [Seizing his arm.] Look to your helm, prince, quick, Or you're within the rapids. Don C. [Recklessly.] True! I know it. Perin. Strain hard! [Leading him off to a group of trees.] That's well; we've just escaped the vortex. [Perin continues to speak to Don CÃ¦sar eagerly aside. Donna D. [Who has several times watched Don CÃ¦sar, and now speaks with a little irritation.] Does he not turn this way? You put me out; I'll play alone. Observe if he looks round. [She plays a soft melody. Perin leads Don CÃ¦sar nearer to her. Don CÃ¦sar appears to examine the garden attentively. Donna D. [Aside to Floretta.] Has he yet turned? Flo. No more than yonder trees. Donna F. [To Diana.] He has taken root. You'll have to dig him up. Donna D. He can't have heard me, then. I'll make him hear. [She betrays increasing impatience while playing, and at length strikes the chords violently. Don CÃ¦sar continues to look at the garden. Don C. [In front, loudly to Perin, his face turned from Diana.] Perin, this park is well laid out; the effect Is bold and rich. Yon group of trees tells finely In contrast with the lawn. Donna D. [Stopping the music.] What do I hear? Talks he of trees and lawns, while here I sit And play the lute unnoticed? Has the man No touch of feeling? Don C. [Loudly to Perin.] I'm especially Delighted with the flower-beds. Those carnations Are most superb. Donna F. [Aside.] Carnations! He's a fool! Praise silly flowers, and let us bloom unheeded! [To Laura.] Don Gaston is a different sort of man. Donna L. So is Don Luis. Donna D. [Very much irritated.] O, he can't have seen me. Floretta, go; tell him I'm in the garden. Flo. [To Don CÃ¦sar, who still appears lost in contemplation of the flowers.] Are you aware, Don CÃ¦sar, that the princess Is in the garden? Don C. [Without altering his position.] The garden, child, is lovely; Most lovely, I confess. That bed's unique. 'Tis exquisite!âone mass of living colour! [Floretta stands astonished for a moment, then returns to Diana, but says nothing. Diana, who has heard Don CÃ¦sar's reply, rises enraged, and seems on the point of leaving the bower. Don CÃ¦sar, still looking at the garden, approaches her, upon which Diana turns back. Perin. [Pleased, apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] I trembled for you. Now I can breathe again. You're born to craze her. Don C. [Apart to him.] You guess not what I suffer. Ah! [Approaching closely to Diana. Perin. [Apart to him.] Fall back. What want you here? Don C. One glimpse of herâbut one! Perin. I can't allow it. Pass her, but don't look. [Don CÃ¦sar passes Diana with emotion, but without looking at her. Donna D. [Beside herself, to Laura.] Pass me, and never deign a look! 'Tis monstrous! Donna L. It seems incredible. Donna D. Go to him, Laura! He'll answer you. Tell him that I have seen him. [Laura approaches Don CÃ¦sar, who is admiring a statue. Donna D. I'm very faint. [She takes her lute, and sits. Donna L. Don CÃ¦sar! [He stands absorbed.] Are you deaf? [He turns.] Were you not told The princess now is here, and has observed you! Don C. [As if rousing himself from a reverie.] How, beauteous Laura? What! the princess here, Resenting my intrusion? You knew, Perin, Of her approach? Why was I not informed? [To Laura.] Pray you, excuse my trespass to her highness. My error was unconscious; but I pay The penalty at once, and so withdraw. [He bows to Laura, and turns as if to go. Laura stands amazed. Donna Diana starts up passionately, and throws the lute upon the ground. Perin. [Aside to Don CÃ¦sar.] That was a masterstroke. [Don CÃ¦sar is going. Donna D. [Aside, advancing.] O heaven! he's going! [Calling aloud, angrily.] Don CÃ¦sar! Prince! Remain! Perin. [Laughing apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] She must come to, Twist how she will. Donna D. Draw near. Don C. [Who has stopped, now advances a few steps.] Was it to me Your highness spoke? Donna D. Trembling with rage.] To you, prince!âyes, to you! Don C. [Approaching.] What is your pleasure? Donna D. [With some composure.] Why have you presumed To venture here? I deemed myself alone, And free from witnesses. Don C. [Pointing to Perin, with pretended embarrassment.] 'Twas Perin's fault. He led me to this spot. If Ihad guessed That you were present, I had bent my steps Some other way. I humbly ask forgiveness. Donna D. But, prince, you heard our music. Don C. [Affecting to ruminate.] Music? No. Donna D. [Excitedly.] O, that's impossible! Donna F. [To Laura.] Too bad! Too bad! Don C. [Feigning perplexity, to Diana.] Have I again displeased you? Then I know not How to avoid offending. Lest I fall Into worse error, and provoke you more, I choose the lesser evilâbanishment. [He bows respectfully, and goes out quickly. Perin. [Aside, delighted.] Bolder at every step! He'll do, he'll do! [He pretends to be perplexed, and stands beside Donna Diana with a sympathising look. She is perfectly stunned. Donna L. The monster! He's not human. Donna F. No, he's metal, And moves by springs. Flo. He's even worse than Perin. Donna D. [Roused from her stupor.] Is it all true? Has this indignity Indeed befallen me? Despised, avoided, Humiliated! I, Diana, I! [To her cousins and Floretta.] Why do you follow me with curious eyes? Fall back: I'd be alone. Donna F. [Apart to Laura, as they retire.] Is she in love? [Fenisa, Laura, and Floretta go out, with arch looks and gestures. Donna D. [To Perin, who is also about to go.] Perin, approach! Speak! Did you bring him here as I desired? Perin. I did; with much ado. Donna D. He must have heard me Play on the lute. What said he? [Perin remains silent as if embarrassed.] Well? Perin. [Affecting to hesitate.] Your highnessâ He saidâ. You mean Don CÃ¦sar? Donna D. Yes, Don CÃ¦sar. What did he say? Perin. He saidâhe said. I beg Your highness to excuse me. Donna D. [Much irritated.] I will know. Perin. He fancied thatâI really can't repeat it. Donna D. Speak, I insist. Perin. [Retreating.] He asked me then what children Were they who gingled thus upon the lute? Donna D. Gingled! Not gingled? Perin. Gingled was the word, And then he stopped his ears thus to shut out The frightful discord, as he called it. Donna D. [Almost weeping.] Slanderer! I cannot bear this. Wretch! Barbarian! [Walks excitedly to and fro. Perin. [Following her.] Ay, and a fool to boot. A shallow, brainless, Dull, pert, conceitedâ Donna D. [Stopping short.] Silence, Perin! How dare you rate him thusâa gentleman Of noble parts, accomplished, braveâGo to! Perin. A thousand pardons, but I never dreamed Abuse of him could wound you. Donna D. Wound me, sirrah! What means that wordâthat look of pity? Think you I am already fall'n? No; once engaged, I'll never quit this conflict. He shall feel I am Diana yetâscorned, not subdued, I'll crush his pride, or in the effort die! [Goes out. Perin. [Repeating her words in a tone of tragic burlesque.] I'll crush his pride, or in the effort die! Well, it's my firm opinion you'll do neither. [He rubs his hands, and runs round the stage in elation. Laura, Fenisa, and Floretta reenter, and crying,ââPerin, is she in love?â âDo tell us, Perin!â âIs she in love?â &amp;c. At length they surround and intercept him, still repeating their questions. Perin. [Extending his hands, with an air of great mystery.] Hush!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. A Hall, with portraits and escutcheons. Wide centre doors open. Grounds by moonlight seen without. Don Gaston is discovered seated in an arm chair. Enter Don Luis. Don L. You, Gaston! Well, how goes it? Don G. [Drowsily.] How goes what? Don L. Why, life of course. Don G. To speak the truth, but slowly. In fact, I'm bored. Don L. That's just my case. Don G. Diana Keeps not her pledge to join the festival, But proudly holds aloof. Don L. She might, and welcome, Did she not also rob us of her cousins, Our partners by lot. Don G. Might I for life wear arch Fenisa's colours, I'd leave to you, Diana. Don L. You may take The pair of them, if gentle Laura's eyes Consent to smile on me. Princess Diana Is too sublime, too unapproachable, For my poor taste. In fact, the lady's rude. Don G. [Looking off.] Here comes Don CÃ¦sar, the December moon. Solemn and slow he movesâjust like a chess-king, Square after square. [To Don CÃ¦sar, who enters, followed by Perin.] Well, knight of the white favour! [Pointing to his white colours. Is it a snowball, emblem of your heart? Don C. You envy me my coldness, friends. No wonder. You burn with love, yet kindle not a spark. Don L. We bear our fate. Diana's cousins, sir, Are fair as she. Don G. As fair, and far more kind Don C. [With a light laugh.] Then you propose deserting to the cousins. To me the man who sees in any woman More than a puppet, does himself become one. [Perin makes signs of approval. Don G. [Aside.] Extremes meet. This wiseacre's half a fool. Don L. [At door.] There they go, Gaston! Did you see? Don G. The cousins? Don L. Yes, both. I have a song for the guitar Meant for my Laura's ear. Don G. And I a lay In my Fenisa's praise, to which the drum And trump shall bear accompaniment. Let's follow. [Don Gaston and Don Luis go out. Don C. [Aside.] How hard is fortune. Changeful hearts like these Secure their prize. I, constant, lose my own. Perin. [Approaching him.] Moody again, prince, and your wild bird snared! Don C. She is indeed a wild bird. Perin. True, she sits And broods on that sweet egg she calls revenge; But I'm mistaken, if love creep not forth, When the time comes for hatching. Still keep firm; She yet has one resourceâone stratagemâ For which prepare yourself. Don C. What's that? Perin. She'll try To make you jealous. Mind whate'er she feigns You credit not a jot. Don C. I'm on my guard, Perin. 'Tis her last chance; but see she comes! [Both look off towards Diana. Don C. The princess! [Enchanted.] How airy is each movement. Like a goddess She rather floats than steps. Perin. Again these raptures! They're dangerous. Retire 'till you subdue them. NoânoâI say; you sha'n't give battle yet. [Don CÃ¦sar goes out slowly, with an apparent desire of approaching Diana. Perin impatiently urges him off on the opposite side. Perin then withdraws to back, and assumes a serious look. Enter Donna Diana, in deep thought. She stops in the centre, without looking round. Perin watches her. A short pause, after which the following refrain of a song is heard. [Refrain sung to guitar off stage. âLaura! Laura! Charming Laura!â Donna D. [Gravely to Perin.] What means this absurd ditty, âLaura! Laura!â Nothing but âLaura!â What insipid folly? Perin. But still it spreads. The men are wild with love, And (you've observed it, madam) love's poor dupes Take instantly to music. Sing they must; And, as you will not let them singâDiana, They choose some meaner name. 'Tis sad, but natural. Donna D. Again! [Song heard off stage, with martial accompaniments. Song. Let Fenisa's praises sound, Let Fenisa's brows be crowned; Bring of flowers the freshest, rarest, For of beauties she's the fairest. Donna D. [Scornfully, and vexed to be neglected.] How grand! How overpowering! Is it not? Perin. Yet folly has its use. A world all wisdom Might become tiresome. Donna D. [Thoughtfully.] Perhaps you're right, And, had Don CÃ¦sar mingled in this trifling, I scarce had blamed him. Not that I desire it. Thank heaven! I'm not assailed with songs from him. Perin. [Aside.] Joy, joy! the bird is caught. [Aloud.] As for Don CÃ¦sar, Remember you released him from his duties. Donna D. I bade him go. Perin. And so he went, of course. Donna D. Why say âof course?â Had he possessed one spark Of spirit he had stayed. Perin. And disobeyed you? Donna D. There are some virtues higher than obedience. Perin. [Aside.] O, my rare system! Donna D. Had he pressed his right To attend on me, perhaps I should have yielded. Perin. âPerhaps!â ay, there's the point. This grave cold prince Takes words in their strict sense. If you say, go, He deems not you mean stay; or that your will not Implies, perhaps you will. He sadly lacks Perception, and the art of reading women. [Aside, observing Diana's absent and melancholy look. Oh, my gold tincture! my elixir vitÃ¦! [Aloud.] But see, the princes with their ladies come; All look absurdly happy. Donna D. [Looking off.] And Don CÃ¦sar Comes with them. Perin. But their childish ecstacies Are lost on him, your highness; be it ours With calm superior eyes to note afar The lot of frail humanity. [They withdraw to back. Enter Don Luis, Don Gaston, Donna Laura, and Donna Fenisa, followed by Don CÃ¦sar. Don L. [Apart to Don Gaston and Don CÃ¦sar.] She's watching. Now then for the attack. Don G. [Apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] Mark how I'll tease her. Don C. Even as you will; I grudge you not the sport. Don L. [Aloud to Laura.] Fortune has smiled on me to-day; would Laura Smile too, I'd ask no further boon of fortune. Donna L. The custom of the mask makes you gallant. [They retire a few steps. Don Luis continues to speak urgently to her, every now and then looking towards Diana. Don G. [Aloud to Fenisa.] Do not think The usage of this night extorts my homage: Your loveliness compels it. Donna F. I would fain Believe you; but you flatter. These love-fires Shoot up too suddenly. Don G. Be you less lovely, And I shall be less ardent. [He kisses her hand, then converses apart with her eagerly, watching Diana from time to time. Donna D. [Aside to Perin.] They've no words, It seems, to waste on me. Perin. [Apart to her.] I could forgive All but Don CÃ¦sar. Look now how he stands,â Embodied apathy! O, I could box His ears with pleasure. [Turns aside to hide his laughter. Don L. [To Laura, Fenisa, and Don Gaston.] What say youâshall we once more to the ball? Don G. Agreed; let us enjoy even to the last, These love-winged hours. [Don Gaston and Don Luis lead their ladies off with eager gallantry, and pass Donna Diana without looking at her. Don CÃ¦sar still stands in abstraction. Donna D. [Annoyed, and with affected scorn to Perin.] They're swimming in a very sea of bliss! Perin. Young blood, young blood! They're not philosophers Like you and me, your highness. [Don CÃ¦sar, as if awaking from his reverie, turns quickly to follow the others. He pretends to see Diana for the first time, bows respectfully, and continues his exit. Donna D. [Aside.] What, Don CÃ¦sar Goes too! he sees me and he goes! I'll try My last and keenest weaponâjealousy. [Aloud.] Call him back, Perin. Perin. Prince! prince! Don C. [Gravely.] Did you call? Perin. I did, my lord. Don C. Some other time. At present I'm in the train of love. Donna D. [Quickly.] Of love? You love? Don C. My freedom. Donna D. You mean, then, that you do not love at all. Freedom's a mere ideal; but love needs An outward object. Don C. Princess, pardon me, As you ne'er loved, you can't tell what love needs. I really can't permit you an opinion Upon that point. [Perin rubs his hands with delight. Donna D. [Significantly.] I may be more entitled To give one than you think. Don C. [With an involuntary start.] You love, then? Donna D. [Aside.] Ha? He started! [Aloud.] It were rash to say I love; But I confess my former views of love Are somewhat shaken. Perin. [Aside.] Somewhat. Don C. [With forced composure.] Will you deign To tell me why? Donna D. [Assuming earnest frankness.] Yes, prince, 'tis only just, As you have shared those views. Then thus I feel: 'Twere selfish to oppose my private will Against a nation's hopes, a father's prayers. To these I therefore yield; and, though my heart As yet is free, since I must take a husband, I've cast my eyes upon your cousin Luis, Prince of BÃ©arne. Perin. [Aside to Donna Diana.] That hit was fatal. [Aside to Don CÃ¦sar.] Nonsense! Springes and bird-lime! [Don CÃ¦sar looks oppressed. Donna D. 'Tis my resolution Therefore to choose him. Could I choose more fitly? [A pause.] Speak! love deludes not you. What's your opinion? You do not answer. Is my choice unwise? [Aside, exultingly.] He's pale and speechless. Yes, at last, at last! [Perin.] [Apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] Shame, prince; is this your firmness? Donna D. Why, Don CÃ¦sar, You seem astonished. Don C. [Recovering himself.] Seem? I am astonished. Donna D. At what? Don C. [Now quite self-possessed.] That there should be two beings so alike As you and I; not only do we think And feel as one, but it appears our thoughts And feelings change together. We are twins, If not by birth, by nature. Tell me, princess, How long is it since you took this resolution. [Donna D.] [Rather confused.] Only to-night. Don C. [Eagerly] The hour? Donna D. [Surprised.] The hour! [Perin, also surprised, listens eagerly. Don C. Was it not Upon the stroke of nine? For then precisely, I took the very self-same resolution, And for the self-same cause. [Looking at her insinuatingly.] To gratify My father and the state I choose a bride. Donna D. [Aside, pleased and softened.] He means myself. Why else the agitation He lately showed? I feel a strange relenting. [Aloud.] Prince, as I freely gave my confidence, I look for yours. Who is the happy fair? Don C. [Almost tenderly.] I fear to tell; but thus far I may venture: She's of near kin to Barcelona's duke. Donna D. [Aside, delighted.] That's to my father! [Aloud.] Smiles she on your suit? Don C. She might, would you befriend it. [Perin makes a gesture of annoyance. Donna D. [Aside, with suppressed exultation.] Just so. [Aloud.] Really? Who can it be? Don C. You have not far to seek. Donna D. [Very graciously.] Speak boldly, prince; her name? Don C. Her name is Laura! Donna D. [Confused.] What! who? Don C. Your highness' cousin, Donna Laura. Perin. [Aside.] Jove, what a move! It takes away one's breath. [Donna Diana is struck dumb. Don C. I feared Don Luis had secured my prize; But, princess, you by choosing him, have rid me Of this great danger. Thanks, a thousand thanks! Well, is my choice approved? [A pause.] You do not answer. What ails your highness? Donna D. Ails me! Ails me! Nothing. Don C. [Pretending anxiety.] You're pale! you tremble; something's wrong. Donna D. Once more I tell you nothing;ânothing but amazement That you should see a goddess in a woman So commonplace, so tame, so plainâ [Checks herself. Don C. As Laura! Donna D. [Aside.] O what a wretch am I thus to miscall My gentle cousin! [Aloud.] Prince, you've shown discernment. Laura has every virtue. Don C. So I think. She's modest, sweet, accomplished, winning, gracefulâ Donna D. [Interrupting.] But very commonplace. Don. C. O, there I differâ Donna D. [Impatiently breaking off the talk.] 'Tis like you may be right. 'Tis an affair Of taste: you follow yours; I mine. [She turns away to hide her agitation. Don C. [Anxiously aside to Perin.] That sounds Decisive. Perin. [Apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] To it again. The fort is silenced. Don C. Princess, with your leave, I now withdraw. [Bows as if to go. Donna D. [Turning hastily.] To your sweet Laura? Don C. Yes. [Looking to back, and feigning rapture as Laura passes out of doors. See where she passes, O enchanting vision! Where all contrasting graces harmonise, Meekness with dignity, simplicity With nice refinement, delicate reserve With ardent feelingâ Donna D. [Interrupting and speaking ironically.] O, go on! Go on! You have not done. This is the prelude only, The first faint note of praise before the chorus, The spark before the fire, the dawn ere day! What is there so bewitching in your idol? What amiable? What endurable? Don C. In Laura, do you ask? Donna D. [Aside.] 'Tis base in me To wrong her thus. [Calming herself by a strong effort. Prince, Laura is my friendâdear as a sister. Though your gross adulation roused my anger, I here retract each syllable I spoke In her dispraise. She's fair, and good as fair. Her heart is noble, and her face a mirror That shows her heart. You're right: goâgo to Laura. Don C. I fly: her sanction gained, I'll then entreat Your father's to confirm it. Finally, To crown this night's rejoicing, I'll tell Luis What happiness your highness destines for him. [He bows gravely and goes out. Donna Diana stands motionless. Perin. [Aside, looking after Don CÃ¦sar.] Played to perfection! Donna D. The abyss of shame Is fathomed. He can love, but loves another. [She sinks into a chair. Perin approaches Diana gravely and with pretended sympathy. Donna D. [Aside.] The thought is torture! [Perin sighs deeply. Feebly.] Perin! Perin. [Sympathisingly.] Yes, your highness. Donna D. [Without looking up.] Comes he not back. Perin. Back! After offering So gross an insult to you! Donna D. Perin, peace! I'm not myself; I'm wretched! Perin. Noble lady, Be calm. Did any see you thus but Perin, He might almost conclude your highness feltâ [Hesitates. Donna D. Felt what! Perin. If I must speak, the pangs of love. Donna D. [Trembling.] The pangs of love! Perin. Be calm, I beg. Of course It can't be love you feel; but, then, what is it? Donna D. I know not. All's distraction. Now I melt In grief, now burn with hatred. I hate Laura; I hate Don CÃ¦sar. Most of all I hate Myself for hating them. Perin. Worse than I thought! This is not love alone: 'tis jealousy! Donna D. [Starting up enraged.] Jealousy, minion! To my face! I jealous? Perin. [Soothingly.] Your highness! Donna D. [With passionate excitement.] Quit my presence. Not a word. You tamper with your life. [Perin withdraws to back in pretended alarm. Diana, who has lost all self-control, stands still for a moment, then covers her face with her hands and hurries off the stage. Perin. [Advancing.] Poor flutterer! Vain are thy struggles; thou art in the net. [Looking off.] Here comes Don Luis. He must draw the strings. [He draws back. Enter Don Luis with Donna Laura on his arm: Don Gaston with Fenisa. Don G. [Advancing with Fenisa.] The masque is over then; I drop my visor. [Takes off his mask. Fenisa takes off hers. Don G. But, though I drop love's emblem, love itself Endures unchanged. I swear I love but thee. Be mine! Donna F. [Aside.] Not yet. [Coyly.] We'll speak of this to-morrow. [Retreating. Don G. To-morrow Would seem to me eternity; to-night. [He follows her and converses with her at back, pressing his suit eagerly. Don Luis and Laura advance to front. Donna L. [Playfully.] No vows, no vows: when lovers simply say, I doubt them; when they swear, I disbelieve them. Don L. [Hurt.] Must I then think you, like your haughty cousin, Incapable of love? If so, farewell. Donna L. [Softly.] Don Luis. Don L. Donna Laura. Donna L. Is this true? Don L. [Approaching her eagerly.] What? Donna L. [With great naÃ¯vete and feeling.] That you love me? Don L. Need you ask? Tormentor! Donna L. [Tenderly.] Nay, if I grieved you, pardon me; for Luis, I truly love you. Don L. [At her feet.] Dearest life! My own! Perin. [Advancing quickly and clapping his hands.] Bravo prince, bravo! But the jest's now over, And love begins in earnest. Don L. [Rising.] How! What mean you? Perin. Matters of weight. [Calling to Donna Fenisa and Don Gaston.] Fair mistress, brave Don Gaston! Don G. [Advancing with Fenisa.] Well? Perin. I've news Concerns you all. Don G. Quick with it then. Perin. Such news! Don L. [Impatiently.] Go on. Perin. The princess has at last Discerned her error, and resolves to marry. Don G. What's that to me? Perin. What's that to you, Don Gaston! I'm thunderstruck. Don G. Good heaven, you cannot mean That she has chosen me. Dissuade her, Perin; Kind, worthy Perin. Donna F. Tell her that Don Luis Would suit her better. Don L. Pray you let Don Luis Speak for himself. Since Gaston is her choiceâ Perin. [Interrupting.] I said not that. Don Gaston's fears are groundless. 'Tis yourself The princess deigns to honour. Don L. Me! You're mad. Perin. [Gravely.] And Donna Laura will be blest forthwith With brave Don CÃ¦sar's hand. Donna L. There go two words, Friend, to that bargain. Don L. This is no time for jesting. Perin. For jesting! I'm amazed. Do these good tidings Fall on ungrateful ears? No matter. Prince, You have avowed yourself the lady's suitor, And, if she wills to take you, must submit. Donna F. Yes, there's no help for it. Don G. You must indeed. Don L. I must! Perin. Decidedly. O chivalry, O knighthood! Don L. [After observing Perin closely.] I fancy still you're not in earnest, Perin. Confess now there's some trick. Perin. [Laughing.] You've sharp wits, Prince. Well then, there is a trick. She has named you, But to provoke another. Don L. Ah, Don CÃ¦sar? Donna L. She loves him? Perin. Well, you're near the mark. And he Has only named you to provoke the princess. Don L. Then we are used Simply for their convenience. Perin. So it seems. Donna L. This is too bad. Perin. I grant it. Don G. It is cool. Donna F. Very. Don L. A marked indignity! [Resentfully. Perin. [Confidentially to Luis, but heard by all.] Take my advice, And you shall have revengeâ[Significantly]âand something more. Don. L. What more? Perin. No less than Donna Laura's hand. Don. L. You mean not that. Perin. I'll stake my head upon it. If you and your fair Donna act your parts As I direct you. Donna L. Act our parts! Donna F. Don't question; Confide in Perin. Don G. [To Fenisa.] 'Twill be sport for us. Perin. [To Don Luis.] Come then; my plan I'll tell you as we walk. Don L. Where would you lead us? Perin. To the princess first. Don. L. Where next? Perin. [Pretending to ruminate.] Where next, Prince? To the altar. Don G. [Applauding.] Excellent, excellent! Donna F. 'Tis quite a play. [All go out. Enter, at opposite side, Donna Diana, in deep reflection. She walks slowly and unsteadily, then stops. Donna D. Disguise is vain. This subtile fire that darts Through all my veins is love; wild, hopeless love! O retribution, terrible but just, The heart I would have tortured, 'scapes, while mine Consumes with agony! [She stands motionless. Perin appears at back with Don Luis, and speaks to him earnestly, pointing to Diana. Don L. [Advancing quickly and resolutely.] Forgive me, generous princess. Joy like mine Stands not on ceremony. For this dear grace I thank you on my knees. [Kneels. Donna D. [Amazed.] What grace, Don Luis? Don L. That which Don CÃ¦sar, with your highness' sanction, Has borne to meâthe grace that gives me right To this fair, priceless hand. Donna D. Either Don CÃ¦sar Has lost his wits, or you have. Don L. [Rising.] Must I think He has deceived me? oh, he dared not trifle With love like mine. I know your highness' truth. I put it to you then; had not Don CÃ¦sar Your warrant for his words? [Perin applauds apart. Donna D. Some idle phrase Perhaps escaped me. Don. L. [Archly, and smiling confidently.] Which he took for earnest. Princess, be frank. Did you not tell Don CÃ¦sar Your choice had fallen on me? [A pause.] Enough, you're silent; The precious words were true. I have but erred In pressing you too rudely. In your promise And in the honour of a royal lady I trust, and so betake me to your father. [He bows and goes out, followed by Perin, who nods to him approvingly. Donna D. What did he say? Have I, rash fool, engaged My honour to him? Must I wed this man? While I see Lauraâah, there's one hope yet! She may not love. I'll tell her all; my anguish Will surely move her pity! Pity! No. Enter Donna Laura, followed by Floretta. Donna L. Retire, Floretta. [Floretta withdraws to back. Donna D. [Aside.] She herself! [Proudly.] Diana Think who thou art. Donna L. Dear cousin, I am come To ask your counsel. Sudden is the chance That brings me hither. To be brief, Don CÃ¦sar Has offered me his hand. In all I yield To the good pleasure of the duke, my uncle, But ere I seek his sanction, would have yours. Donna D. [Aside.] Can I endure this? [A short pause. Donna L. Have you heard me, cousin? Donna D. I have, I have. Mark, girl, how cruel Fortune Sports with poor mortalsâto the thirsty wretch Denies one cooling drop, yet opes a fountain For him whose cup brims over. So with us. Don CÃ¦sar's prideâyou know itâkindled mine; Yet he is at your feet. [Becoming more and more excited. Think not I'm jealous. Girl, he has despised me, And mocked me past endurance. Gentle cousin, Pour on him the contempt that I have borne; Join all extremes to punish him. Be ice When he implores; when you resist be fire. Be like the magnet, that with double force Draws and repels. Be the seductive stream, Bright, smooth, and swift, that hurries to the whirlpool, But fatal as its eddy. Let him feel What I have felt, until he writhes as I writhe! [Perin appears at back. Donna L. What counsel's this? Must I enact the crime You blame in him? No; if he truly love me, I shall return his love. Donna D. You dare not! Think you I'd suffer it. Though spurned, I still adore him. [After a pause, and with great effort. Heed not my frantic words, I'm not myself. [She takes both Laura's hands, kisses her forehead, and continues, with suppressed emotion. I'm quite content. Be happy, dearest child. Enjoy the bliss you well deserveâthe blissâ [Overpowered. That IâO heaven! [She bursts into tears and falls on Laura's neck. Floretta approaches them. Donna L. Floretta, I'm alarmed. I've been too cruel. Flo. [Apart to her.] No; the froward child Deserves the rod. Remember how she plagued us. Donna D. [Recovering.] Hence, away! I love thee, Laura, but can't brook thy sight. Donna L. What can I do? Even should I yield Don CÃ¦sar, Are you not bound in honour to Don Luis? Donna D. [Aside, as if struck.] Bound to Don Luis? [Aloud, with dignity and stern composure.] Go. Forget what's past. You've seen the last fond weakness of Diana. Donna L. [Alarmed.] Pray heaven she take not Luis after all. [She retires, followed by Floretta, and speaks to Perin at back. Donna Laura, Floretta, and Perin go out. Donna D. [After a pause.] Bound to Don Luis! I'll redeem my pledge. CÃ¦sar, if thou hast guessed my love, this hour Shall show thee I subdued it. With unfaltering step I'll walk to doom, a princess though a victim. [She retires to a chair at back, and sits apart, with an air of lofty abstraction. Enter Don CÃ¦sar and Perin. They advance to front. Don C. Can I believe you, Perin? Perin. [Observing Diana, and speaking apart to him in a low cautious tone.] Hush; she's here. Yes, prince, she loves you fondly, desperately; She has confessed it. Don C. Let me thenâ Perin. Not yet. A word might ruin all. The Duke himself Is privy to our plot, and comes to crown it. [Flourish of trumpets announcing approach of the Duke. Enter Don Diego, Don Luis, Don Gaston, Donna Laura, Donna Fenisa, Floretta; enter also ladies and gentlemen of the Court at back. Don D. [To Don Luis and the rest, with a slight glance at Diana.] No tidings, princes, more than these could bless A father's ear. My people and myself May well rejoice. Daughter, your choice is known; But it befits this high solemnity That you in form record it. Bid your bridegroom Now lead you forth. Donna D. [With stern resolution.] Don Luis. Don L. [Aside, confounded.] How! The jest Grows serious. She can't mean it. Don C. [Alarmed, apart to Perin.] What's this, Perin? Donna L. [Agitated, apart to Perin.] Perin!â [Don Gaston, Donna Fenisa, and Floretta also signify amazement. Donna D. I wait, Don Luis. Don L. [Aside.] Heavens! I'm lost. [Advances to Diana. Perin. [Apart to Don CÃ¦sar and Donna Laura.] I tremble; but the game's not over. Donna D. [Advancing hand in hand with Don Luis to Don Diego.] Father, Pronounce the form. Don D. [Surprised.] Diana. Perin. [Apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] Catch her eye, prince! Quick, quick! [Don CÃ¦sar approaches Diana. Donna D. [To Don Diego.] Pronounce the form. Don D. Repeat it, As I proceed; thusâYou, Diana, daughter Of Don Diego. Donna D. [With a low and constrained tone.] I, Diana, daughter Of Don Diego. Don D. Duke of Barcelona. And heiress to the Duchy. Donna D. Duke of Barcelona. And heiressâ [She catches Don CÃ¦sar's eye and stops short. Don D. [Prompting her.] To the Duchy. You forget. Donna D. Ay. To the Duchy. Don D. Here espouse Don Luis. Don D. [Looking fixedly at Don Luis.] Hereâhereâespouseâespouseâ [She stops short. Don D. How now, you falter. Donna D. [Aside.] My doom at hand, no rescue, no escape! [Turning suddenly and observing Don Luis. Look, look, his head is bowed! He stands like marble. Is this a bridegroom's aspect? Hear me, Luis! If, without love, you claim me, you commit A wrong past pardon. If you would retract, And choose some dearer mate, declare itâanswer. Don L. I'm bound to you by honour. Donna D. Ay, by honour, But not by love. You do not say by love. [A pause. You cannot say it. Then I dissolve the bond. [She quits his side. Don L. Princess, it is your pleasure. I submit. [Bows. Don D. Don Luis, is this true? Your choice falls elsewhere? [A short pause. Don C. Duke, if I err not, yes. [He advances to Donna Laura, leads her to Don Luis, and joins their hands. Donna D. [Starting.] How? Laura! Don D. [Feigning surprise.] Laura! [To Don CÃ¦sar.] Prince, methought yourself Were plighted to my niece. Don C. Sir, in the masque Just ended, I have worn your daughter's colours. Don D. But the masque over, you are free. Don C. Great duke, I'm not impatient for my freedom. Donna D. [Who has listened attentively, starting.] Ah! Don D. How must I take you? Do you love my daughter? Don C. [Gazing tenderly on Diana.] I dare not say what might so much offend her. Donna D. [Advancing from the rest, and speaking aside.] Am I so blest? Don D. [To Don CÃ¦sar.] Your trifle, prince. Speak some one. Donna D. [Gravly, with downcast eyes.] The task be mine. Down stubborn heart! Subdued And chastened to repentance, own thy sin, Cast off thy vain disguise. If e'er I wed I call him lord who vanquished pride by pride. Don C. [Approaching her eagerly.] And who is he? Donna D. [With painful vehemence, and raising her hand which he passionately seizes.] Tyrant, why ask? Thyself. [She bursts into tears. Don C. [Embracing her.] Tyrant! Ah, no. I have but conquered, sweet, the privilege To be your slave for ever. Perin. [Aside, drawing a long breath.] Safe in port! I thought we should have foundered. Donna D. [Apart to Don CÃ¦sar.] And thou lov'st me? Don C. Love thee? 'Twas love alone that gave me strength To feign indifference. O the strife was fearful. Perin. [Aside, approaching them.] Yes, I'll be sworn, it was. Don C. [Shaking Perin's hand.] Hail prince of schemers! [To Donna Diana.] 'Twas his shrewd brain that planned my whole attack. Perin. Fie, prince! Have you no conscience? Would you charge Your crafty doings on a simple, honest, Straightforward soul like me? Donna D. [Shaking her hand at Perin, in playful menace.] O traitor, traitor! Don D. [Gaily.] We've all been traitors, daughter, more or less. But now the game is done, and all that's real Is your own happiness and CÃ¦sar's love. Donna D. Others are happy with us. You, Don Luis, Have won a prize in Laura; you, Don Gastonâ Don G. [Taking Fenisa's hand.] Am the proud satellite of this bright star. Flo. Perin! you see what all the rest have done. Shall we be out of fashion? Perin. Child, don't plague me. It needs consideration. Donna D. [Sportively.] Perin, I'll not bear To see her tortured. Perin. [Aside.] You know what it means. Donna D. Take her, and with her take five thousand ducats. Perin. Your highness, I must yield, if you command. None else should force me. [To Floretta.] Come, then, saucy jade. [Kisses her heartily. Donna F. [To Diana.] It seems our fate, dear cousin, to be slaves. Donna D. The willing slave in all but name is free, Contented vassalage is liberty; Weak are we, and must cling. Don C. But gentle too, And when most yielding, do the most subdue. Donna D. Let man then rule the world; 'tis nature's plan. Don C. While woman, by her sweetness, governs man. END OF DONNA DIANA.</field>
