      <field name="fulltext">PRINCESS TOTO. ARGUMENT. King Portico is a very dignified monarch, who is keenly alive to a sense of the ridiculous, and nervously anxious never to place himself in a false or absurd position. His dignity, however, is continually compromised by the eccentricities of his daughter, Princess Toto, a young lady who has no memory whatever, who forgets incidents two minutes after they have occurred, who is absurdly romantic, and who acts, as a great many other people do in this world, invariably on the “spur of the moment.” At the commencement of the piece Princess Toto is on the point of being married to Prince Caramel, a wealthy potentate, of extremely mild and gentlemanly deportment, but whose sense of punctuality is somewhat at fault. All has been prepared for the wedding, and everything is in readiness except the bridegroom, whom King Portico has been expecting for the last three days, but who has not yet arrived. It should be stated that Princess Toto was betrothed in infancy to Prince Doro, who is supposed to have been devoured by cannibals. This, however, is a false report, inasmuch as he actually escapes, and, in point of fact, turns up at King Portico's court to claim Princess Toto's hand just as the King is giving up all hopes of Prince Caramel appearing. The King, who is keenly alive to the absurdity of the figure he will cut if no bridegroom should be available after all the preparations have been made, suggests that Prince Doro should take Prince Caramel's place as the bridegroom. Princess Toto, on seeing Prince Doro, forgets all about her betrothal to Prince Caramel, and thinks the preparations are for her marriage with Prince Doro. In fact, as the King remarks, she “mixes up her lovers”; and she and Prince Doro are duly married, King Portico entreating his Prime Minister, Zapeter, to break the news of Princess Toto's marriage with Prince Doro to Prince Caramel when he arrives so diplomatically that he shall rather like it than otherwise. While the ceremony is taking place, Prince Caramel, attended by his two friends, Baron Jacquier and Count Floss, arrives, and is informed by Zapeter that the Princess is being married to another. He is in despair at the news; but Zapeter reminds him that, among other eccentricities, the Princess is absurdly romantic, and that she at this moment is intensely interested in the fortunes of a certain desperate brigand called Barberini, who, through his depredations, is the scourge of the surrounding neighbourhood, and suggests to Prince Caramel to disguise himself as Barberini, and his followers as the brigand's band, and carry her off to his mountain home. This plan is executed, with the anticipated result. Princess Toto (who has forgotten all about her marriage with Prince Doro) is fascinated with the brigands' description of their romantic life, and determines to cast her fortune with theirs. King Portico's distress at the disappearance of his daughter is only equalled by his sense of the ridiculous appearance he will make in the eyes of surrounding nations. He determines to follow her, and, if possible, induce her to return to her home. Feeling convinced that he can only achieve this through the agency of some artificial inducement which shall appeal to her romantic nature, he, accompanied by Zapeter and Jamilek, who disguise themselves as Indians, present themselves before Princess Toto, who half-an-hour previously has given her hand to Prince Caramel—believing him to be Barberini the brigand—and has forgotten all about it. She is charmed with the unconventional manners of the Indians, and impulsively determines to join them. They carry her off in triumph, but are followed by Prince Caramel, who eventually overtakes them in a tropical island. In the meantime Prince Doro has established his sway over Princess Toto, and Prince Caramel is compelled to give his hand to Jelly, a young lady who has tended him during the protracted agonies of the sea voyage. The King discovers himself to Princess Toto, who promises never to compromise him again, and all ends happily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene—Gardens of King Portico's Palace. Zapeter, Jamilek, Courtiers, &amp;c., discovered. All are very prim and precise in appearance. CHORUS. This is a court in which you'll find The most respectable society; To every fault we all are blind, Except the fault of impropriety. We pride ourselves upon our taste, It is indeed our only vanity; And when in false positions placed It almost drives us to insanity. This is a court, &amp;c. Flourish. Enter King Portico. King. Is there no sign of Prince Caramel? Zap. None, my liege. King. This is a bad beginning. His marriage with our daughter was to have taken place the day before yesterday; for two days and a half everything has been in readiness, and we are getting tired of waiting; besides, the people are becoming impatient, and when we appear among them we shall be received with derisive remarks. It's a very bad beginning. It's a slight. It will serve to make us appear ridiculous in the eyes of the surrounding nations. I will give him five minutes more, and then—Is everything ready? Jam. Everything, sire. King. The musicians are here? Jam. They are all here, sire. King. I trust the cornet-players have been instructed not to puff out their cheeks when they blow; nothing is more ridiculous than to see a man expressing a tender sentiment with cheeks like dumplings. The singers—I hope they will be careful not to open their mouths too wide; it's a very common fault with singers. Zap. All this has been attended to. King. Very good. There will be no cheering, of course. Nothing is more vulgar than enthusiasm. I shall make but one speech, and that will be received in respectful silence. Zap. Your speeches, sire, are always so received. King. I have remarked it. Well, I think we have provided against mishaps, as far as we are able to do so. There is nothing left but to trust that nothing will occur to make us ridiculous in the eyes of surrounding nations. [Reprise of Chorus, and exeunt Jamilek and the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Court singing, “This is a court in which you'll find.”] King. Zapeter, between ourselves, it's a most extraordinary thing that that young man doesn't come. Three days late for his wedding! It's inexcusable. Zap. It will be deplorable if anything has occurred to change his mind. King. Deplorable! it will be more than deplorable—it will be disastrous! It is no news to you that the unparalleled eccentricities of my daughter, Toto, have caused me the greatest uneasiness; for they have drawn down ridicule upon us, and made us absurd in the eyes of surrounding nations. It therefore became necessary, as we valued our own self-respect, to get her married at once. Prince Doro, to whom she was betrothed in infancy, unfortunately died, and as Prince Caramel immediately offered to supply his place I closed with him at once. He is a highly respectable young prince, but he is certainly unpunctual. Three days late! Dear, dear, dear! I trust it won't get about; I am most anxious about that. Great heaven!— if he should not come at all!—or, worse still, if he should come ridiculously dressed. There is madness in the thought! Zap. My liege, in the excess of our grief and disappointment I believe we should all go stark staring mad. King. Do you really think you would? Then I trust you will be careful to go mad with dignity, and even in your severest paroxysms preserve your sense of self-respect. Re-enter Jamilek. Jam. Sire, a gentleman is at the gate, and desires to speak with your Majesty alone. King. Alone! This is a very strange request. Jam. The gentleman, sire, is a stranger. Zap. It may be that he brings news of Prince Caramel. King. Very likely; but why should he not speak openly? Zap. Perhaps he brings news that it would be undignified to publish. King. Such as— Zap. Such as that his Highness has the measles, or the mumps. A royal wedding postponed on account of the bridegroom's mumps! Oh! if it should get into the papers! King. I should die of confusion; the whole universe would be laughing at us. Admit him by all means; and if the news is such as I can listen to without loss of dignity, I will hear what he has to say. [Exeunt King and Zap. Enter Prince Doro. Doro. At last, after many perils by land and sea, I have arrived at my destination, and the particular fortune in store for me will soon be revealed. What a singular one is mine! Betrothed at the immature age of one to a lovely princess of twelve months, whom, owing to a confoundedly annoying series of circumstances, I have never seen since! Who can wonder at my anxiety to know what kind of young lady she has blossomed into? SONG.—Doro. O bride of mine, O baby wife, In cradledom demurely plighted, Has time dealt kindly with thy life, Since thou and I were first united? Art thou as fair, and yet as fond, As in that stage of preparation? Ah! since those days the wizard's wand Has worked some wondrous transformation. O bride of mine, whose smiles or tears Will season all my hopes and fears, How art thou changed in eighteen years! Art thou a cold, imperious maid? Or canst thou stoop to homely duty? A scornful Juno, proud and staid? A Hebe blushing in her beauty? Hast thou a brain with lore opprest? With science in its ev'ry section? Or is thy learning in thy breast? Thine only art—to win affection? O bride of mine, &amp;c. Re-enter King Portico. King. I believe you wished to see the King? Doro. Am I right in supposing this to be the royal palace? King. This is a—in short, one of them. It is not the best of them; but the others are under repair. Doro. Sir, I salute you with every sentiment of the profoundest respect. King. (Aside) Now I wonder if he meant that! Doro. You would perhaps like to know who I am. It is but natural. I, sir, have the honour to be betrothed to your daughter. I have had that honour for many years past, but circumstances have prevented me from making use of the fact. I have been wrecked on a savage shore, and I found myself compelled to dwell among the natives for ten years. Eventually, I made my escape, and the first thing I did was to hasten hither to see if my little Toto loved me still. King (weeping). It is an affecting story; but I don't know you. You won't pretend you are Prince Caramel? Doro. Certainly not; I am Prince Doro. King. How extremely awkward! Doro. I am not usually considered so. King. Pardon me, I don't mean that. Don't be angry; but it was generally supposed that you were—in short, dead; and, not to put too fine a point upon it, the Princess is going to marry another Prince —a nice, well-behaved young man—plays the flute, does worsted work, wears goloshes. He's a highly respectable young man; it's a highly respectable court too; they all play the flute and all wear goloshes— a very nice court! Plenty of quiet fun, and no excess. Doro. And where is this exemplary youth? King. That's what I want to know; we're waiting for him. We can't think why he hasn't come. It—it's a slight. It will put us in an absurd light. I—I—I am very angry—very angry indeed. Doro. Well, upon my honour, this is extremely pleasant! King. It's extremely kind and extremely pleasant of you to look at it in that way; and, between ourselves—between ourselves, I say —I don't think you've lost much. Doro. Not lost much! Why she promised to be as beautiful as the day. King. Oh! she's more beautiful than some days—the day before yesterday, for instance. Yes, she's a very fine woman: but—well— she is rather difficult to deal with. Toto, bless her! is extremely wilful and obstinate, and ridiculously impulsive and romantic. Her head is filled with foolish ideas about gipsies, robbers, actors, pirates, paving commissioners, Red Indians, auctioneers, and outlandish people of that sort. Just now it's the brigand Barberini, the scourge of the neighbourhood. She can think and talk of nothing else—wears a lock of his wig round her neck. You have no idea how she compromises me. Then she has no memory—no memory whatever; forgets events that are not ten minutes old. Acts, too, on the spur of the moment; eats, drinks, sleeps, on the spur of the moment—gets up on the spur of the moment—sits down on the spur of the moment. And this causes a great deal of unnecessary pain and inconvenience. I assure you, it's a fortunate thing for you that you are dead. Doro. But I can scarcely be said to be dead. King. Oh yes, you are, indeed! You think you're not, but you are. We had it on the best authority; you were eaten by savages. You can't get over that, you know. Doro. But I assure— King. Really, I can't permit the subject to be re-opened. It comes to this. Either you are dead, or I am placed in a very awkward and ridiculous position. You see my difficulty. Doro. Perfectly. I also see my own. Am I to understand that I've travelled night and day from the shores of Patagonia for nothing? King. Of course, I can't say how much it has cost you, but you are lucky if you have travelled all that way for nothing; you've nothing to complain of. After all, you'll see the wedding festivities, you know; you're in time for that. Your name will be in the papers. What more can you want? Doro. What more? Why, my life is a blank from this moment, I loved her the first day I saw her. I can see her now, lying in her nurse's arms, and toying with an india-rubber ring. Is she much changed? King. Yes you'll find her grown. Fickle, like all women, she has wearied of her india-rubber ring. As for her personal appearance, you can judge for yourself, for here she comes. [King and Doro retire. Enter Bridesmaids and Princess Toto, followed by Jelly. CHORUS OF BRIDESMAIDS. Of our opinions to impart Some notion let's endeavour; May she be mistress of her heart, And he her slave for ever. Toto. Dressed at last! How do I look, Jelly? Jelly. Lovely, your Highness! Toto. Let me see! What did I put on this dress for, Jelly? Jelly. To be married in, your Highness. Toto. Of course; I forgot. It's an awful thing being married! Jelly. It's still more awful not being married, your Highness! Toto. Do you find that, Jelly? Jelly. I do, your Highness. Toto. Well, I suppose you're right. It's certainly very pleasant to think that somebody who loves you better than anybody else in the whole world, and who is going to love you like that, only more so, all his life, and isn't going to care a button for any one else as long as he lives, is coming all the way from ever-so-far, like an arrow from its quiver, because he feels he can't get on any longer without you. Why, papa, you look annoyed. Don't you like the sentiment? King. Yes, I like the sentiment, but it don't fit the situation. He is not coming like an arrow from its quiver; he's dawdling, my child, dawdling. Toto. Who's dawdling? King. Why, Prince Caramel's dawdling. Toto. And who is Prince Caramel, I wonder? I know the name, too; I've heard it somewhere. Jelly, what do I know about Prince Caramel? Jelly. He's the gentleman your Highness is going to be married to. Toto. Of course; I remember. To-day, isn't it? Jelly. This very day! I've just been dressing you for the purpose. Toto. To be sure you have. Now, what an old goose you must be to have forgotten that! King. Pardon me, we did not forget it; and we are not an old goose. Toto. Well, if I'm to be married, let's get it over! King. But the bridegroom! We must wait for the bridegroom. Toto. Wait for the bridegroom? Nonsense! Who cares about the bridegroom at a wedding? Nobody thinks about him. The bride monopolizes all the interest; and if she is ready we'll begin. She is ready, isn't she? Jelly. Quite ready, your Highness! Toto. Then send her here; I should like to see her. (Jelly hands a looking-glass.) What's this? Oh! of course, I'm the bride. You silly old man, you forgot I was the bride. Ah! it's lucky I've my wits about me, or I don't know what would become of you all. King. But the bridegroom! He's insignificant, I admit; but so is the organ-blower in church, yet the organist can't get on without him. You admit the parallel? Toto. Entirely; but as anybody can blow an organ, so anyone can be a bridegroom. This gentleman, for instance—who is he? (Indicating Doro.) Doro. I am an unhappy prince, who has been cruelly jilted. False girl, I am the miserable Doro. Toto. Doro? I know that name—Jelly, what do I know about the miserable Doro? Jelly. He's the gentleman your Highness was betrothed to before Prince Caramel; the gentleman who died. Toto. I remember. I loved you, Doro, and to this day when I think of your unhappy end, I can't restrain my tears. You—you were devoured by cannibals; they ate you up (sobbing). Did—did—did it hurt? Doro. Cruel girl, you concern yourself with the torture of a devoured body, but you have little sympathy for the agony of a crushed soul. Learn, faithless one, that I was not eaten—that I escaped—and that I stand before you. Toto. My own, own husband (embracing him). Doro. You love me then? Toto. Love you? If you had any idea how slowly the last three days have passed without you, you would not ask that question. (To Jelly.) Come, we must be off. Re-enter Zapeter. Jelly. Off! Off where? Toto. Off where? what a memory you have! Why off to church, to be sure. They've actually forgotten that this is my wedding day. Oh! it's enough to vex a saint, it is. Doro. But why are we to go to church? Toto. Why? why, to be married of course—I've waited three days, isn't that enough? Zap. Oh, but your Highness, this is not— King. (Aside) Hush! Silence! She has mixed up her lovers. (Aloud to Doro) Fall in with her views. Zap. But sire, reflect, Prince Caramel may arrive at any moment, and if he should lose his temper—a very likely contingency under the circumstances—and interrupt the ceremony, you would be placed in a very ridiculous and absurd position. Every one would laugh at you. King. Oh, would they? very good. We will take precautions against that. You will remain here, and receive Prince Caramel; you will explain the case to him diplomatically—you understand—diplomatically —you will so frame your explanation that he shall receive it in perfect good humour; indeed, he shall rather like it than otherwise. And if he gets angry, or says or does anything to make us appear ridiculous in the eyes of the surrounding nations, we shall hold you responsible for it; you understand? ENSEMBLE. Toto, Doro, Zapeter, and King. Doro. Come, let us hasten, love, to make us one, And on your finger I will place a token; (Aside) This is a thing that's very often done, For promises are made but to be broken. Toto. I mean to be a wife this very day, And you should have been here some days before, Oh! (Aside) I have resolved to give my heart away, And if to any one why not to Doro. King (Aside). We cannot wait; If he is late It's his affair, And he must bear, Without offence, The consequence Of being late; We cannot wait, It's his affair, And he must bear, &amp;c. Zap. (Aside). They cannot wait; If he is late It's my affair, And I must bear For my offence, The consequence Of being late; They cannot wait, It's my affair, And he must bear, &amp;c. Doro, Toto, and King. So let us away to the wedding, Away to the wedding to-day, No minuet measure be treading, But merrily trip it away. Zapeter. So now they are off to the wedding, Off, off to the wedding to-day, While I many tears shall be shedding, But there'll be the dickens to pay. [Dance off. Zap. This is a pleasant position for a diplomatist. I have to explain, diplomatically, to the prince, that the bride he is coming to marry is at present being married to somebody else, and the news must be broken so diplomatically that he shall rather like it than otherwise. (Fife and drum heard without.) Unless I am very much mistaken, there he is. He has arrived at last. Oh! spirit of diplomacy—angel or devil—whichever you are—assist me in this emergency. [Exit. Enter Count Floss, Prince Caramel, and Jacquier. The Prince is engaged on a pair of worsted—work slippers. Jacquier is knitting, and Floss is tatting. They are very mild and simple young men. MARCH. With princely state, With fife and drum, Some three days late, We come, we come! When such as we come out in state, What if we be some three days late! Car. Three days late! It's not much, and even now my wedding present is not finished! Jacq. Nor mine! Floss. Nor mine! Car. Late as we are, they don't seem to be ready for us. The town is empty; not a soul to be seen! Not a guard of honour, no sentries, no band, no people! It's most extraordinary! Re-enter Zapeter. Jacq. (seeing Zap.) Ha! here is a person at last! Sir, will you kindly inform us whom we have the honour of addressing? Zap. (Aside) A skilful diplomatist never commits himself to a statement. (Aloud) You ask me who I am? Who shall say? Know thyself, said the philosopher; and he was right. (Aside) Neatly parried. Car. The Princess, I trust, is well? Zap. Well and ill are relative terms. Of three individuals—A, B, and C—A may be singularly robust as compared with C, but a confirmed invalid as compared with B. These are momentous questions. (Aside) Well fenced. Floss. Is her Highness engaged? Zap. It may be that she is engaged. It may even be that she is married. (Aside) The thin end of the wedge! Car. I do not understand you. Her Highness is a single lady. Zap. Single and double are relative terms of people. Of three people, A, B, and C, B may be single as compared with A, but double as compared with C. Some people are more single than others; some people, on the other hand, are more double than others. A wedding! what is it? a ceremony! why stand upon ceremony? The Princess desires that there may be no ceremony between you. (Aside) The ice is broken. Car. Oh, sir, I am a plain man who does not understand wily talk. That your words are wise I feel sure, for I cannot make head or tail of them. It seems to me that you wish to express some idea. If you would kindly translate it into words of two syllables and under, I think I should succeed in grasping it more readily. Zap. (Aside) Brought to bay. It is not possible to express oneself diplomatically in two syllables. (Aloud) Sir, the Princess waited for you until she could wait no longer. Car. Yes, I follow you. Zap. So, another potentate. Car. That's three syllables. Zap. True; I apologise. Jacq. That's four! Zap. I really beg your pardon, I mean to say that I'm sorry—I regret it. A Prince having offered—Prince Doro—she accepted, and they are being married now. (Aside) Ruined; he winces. Car. But, goodness me! you don't mean to say that I'm jilted? Zap. I didn't mean to say it, but you made me. If you had let me run on in polysyllables, I would have broken it more delicately; but you would have it in two syllables, and I'm a ruined diplomatist. Floss. But is there no way? Zap. None, they're at the church now. Car. We will go to the church, and protest. Zap. (in great terror) No, no, don't do that, for mercy's sake; I shall lose my head if you do. Car. But what am I to do? You can't expect that I'm going to submit quietly to such an insult. I can bear a good deal, but I can't stand that. Jacq. and Floss. We can't stand that, you know. Zap. Stop! An idea occurs to me. Work upon her emotions; trade on her impulses; make capital out of her eccentricities. The Princess has no memory, and acts always on the spur of the moment. Just now she can talk and think of nothing but the brigand Barberini. Her romantic mind is fascinated by the accounts she has heard of his personal beauty and his picturesque exploits. Disguise yourself as the brigand, catch her alone after the ceremony, declare yourself, she will forget all about her recent marriage, she will propose to join you, yield an unwilling assent, and off you go with her. Car. But where? Zap. To the Rocky Pass. Send your friends and relatives on ahead disguised as the brigand's band; keep up the illusion for a day or two; then, when she is thoroughly tired of robber life, undeceive her, have a clergyman in readiness, and marry her straight off. (Aside) I ought to be ashamed of myself. QUARTETT. Prince Caramel, Floss, Jacquier, and Zapeter. Car. My hand upon it—'tis agreed: I'll do the deed! Floss and Jacq. He'll do the deed! Car. In masquerade as brigand chief, I'll play the thief! Floss and Jacq. He'll play the thief! Zap. Then come with me, and do not doubt; I'll rig you out! The Others. He'll rig us out! Zap. Look fierce, and stamp to make a show; And stamp just so—just so! Omnes. Look fierce, and stamp to make a show; And stamp just so—just so! ENSEMBLE. In this disguise, From knowing eyes We shall be quite secure; A brigand dress This quaint Princess Successfully will lure! [Exeunt Omnes. Re-enter Doro, Toto, and Bridesmaids. VOCAL WALTZ.—Toto. Banish sorrow till to-morrow, Let me not rejoice alone; Rob from pleasure all its treasure, For my love is all my own. Banish reason for a season, Place King Folly on his throne; Fairest flowers deck the hours, For my love is all my own. Men tell of vows that droop and perish, Ere yet the spring of life is past; Within my heart thy love I'll cherish: While it beats that love will last. Banish sorrow, &amp;c. [Exeunt Bridesmaids. Doro. At last we are alone together! Alone for the first time in our lives! Toto. It's very pleasant. I wonder if I shall like you! Doro. I think you'll like me; I'm very popular. Toto. Good-tempered? Doro. Angelic. Toto. Because I think I ought to have a good-tempered husband. I think I am the sort of girl who would irritate a touchy man. You see my temper is uncertain; and I'm impetuous, and impulsive, and my memory is very bad. Doro. Very bad? Toto. Very bad indeed. Do you know—but you'll be angry if I tell you. Doro. Not a bit. Toto. Well, then, do you know that on my way back from church I've been twice on the point of asking you if you were going to make a long stay with us? Doro. No? Toto. It's a fact—and just now I was all but enquiring of Jelly whether you were married or single. I quite forgot we'd just been married; that's bad, isn't it? Doro. Yes, I should try and recollect that, if I were you. It might give rise to unpleasantness if you forgot it often. What are you doing? Toto. (who is tying a knot in her pocket-handkerchief). That is to remind me that I'm a married lady; as long as that's there I shall never forget it. Doro. But in the course of time the handkerchief will go to the wash, and what will you do then? Toto. What a clever man you are! Of course it will, I never thought of that. Then, bless me! (showing another knot) I shall forget this too—and this is ten times more important than the other. Doro. And what may that knot be for? Toto. I sha'n't tell you—it's a secret. Doro. But there must be no secrets between us; we are man and wife now, and you must tell me everything. DUET.—Doro and Toto. Doro. Oh, tell me now, by plighted vow, And tell me, tell me truly, What cunning plot lies in that knot, That you have tied so newly? Does it recall some public ball, To which you want inviting? Or is it to encourage you Some letter to be writing? My jealous mind no rest will find, My eyes will know no sleeping, Till I extract the mystic fact It holds within its keeping. Oh, let that mystic fact be known To me alone, to me alone. Toto. No, no; that secret shall be known To me alone, to me alone, Yes, I'll confide why this was tied— Forgive my thoughtless chatter. It is designed to call to mind A most important matter. I'll tell you now, although I vow We're not one till to-morrow, This knot was tied by me, your bride, To tell me that— To tell me that— To tell me that— To tell me that— O grief, O rage, O sorrow! My fatal memory knows no laws, My head is filled with cotton, I cannot tell you, dear, because, Alas, I've quite forgotten; That secret never can be known, Not even unto me alone. Doro (angrily). Until that fact to me is known, I'll live alone—I'll live alone. [Exit furiously. Toto. Poor fellow, I'm sorry he's so angry, but what can I do? I've entirely forgotten what it refers to. Next time I want to remember something, I shall tie two knots—one to remind me that I want to remember something, and the other to remind me what it is I want to remember. Re-enter Jelly in great excitement. Jelly. Oh! your Highness, such news. As I was looking through the great iron gates of the palace just now, what should I see but three great fierce-looking men in sugarloaf hats trimmed with ribbons, great mysterious-looking cloaks on their shoulders, and guns and daggers and pistols stuck all over them. Toto. (delighted). They must be brigands—how delightful! And what did you do? Jelly. Do! I saw at a glance that all was lost, so I ran back to the palace for the key, unlocked the gates, and threw myself into their arms, exclaiming “Resistance is useless: I am your prisoner, carry me off to your mountain home.” Toto. Noble-hearted girl! And what did they do? Jelly. Why, they said I was a bold-faced thing, and ought to be ashamed of myself. The tall one gave me a tract. Toto. Eccentric creatures! Did you hear their names? Jelly. Let me see, the tall one was called Barbar—Barber— Toto (excited). Not Rini? Don't say it was Rini. Jelly. Rini it was—Barberini. Toto. It is their blood-stained and desperate chief. Jelly. He was working a pair of slippers. He said they were for you. Toto. For me? Send him here at once, don't lose a moment. (Exit Jelly.) At last I shall see the romantic monster who is the dread of the whole country, what can he want with me?—perhaps to carry me off—How dreadful but how picturesque! Enter Caramel disguised as a brigand. He is followed by Jelly, and looks very mean and pitiful. Car. My heart is in my mouth, but I have committed myself to it, and must go on with it. I have sent Floss and Jacquier to tell my court to disguise themselves as brigands, and await me in the Rocky Pass. Toto (coming forward). And are you really Barberini? Car. I am really Barberini. Ain't you frightened? Toto. Not a bit. Car. But I look terrible, don't I? Toto. Not so terrible as I expected. I thought there would be more of this sort of thing about you. (Striding fiercely about.) Car. Oh, I'm like that sometimes. (Strides about stage.) Toto. That's more like it. Go on—oh, it's lovely. Isn't it, Jelly? Jelly. It's beautiful—so noble, so picturesque. Car. (who has been stamping about all this time). Do you wish me to keep this up? It's rather fatiguing. Toto. No, not now that I see you can do it, if you like. Come, and sit down, and tell me all about yourself. Car. With pleasure. Don't touch that, my dear; never play with firearms, an accident so soon happens. Put it down, there's a good girl. Toto. Do what the gentleman tells you, Jelly. And so you are really the ferocious monster I've heard so much about? You don't look so very dreadful either. Car. Oh, that's my nasty cunning: it disarms people and puts them off their guard. Now do leave that gun alone. Toto. And do you really hide behind rocks, and pot at travellers as they ride by, and take them prisoners, and make them write for ransom, and send them home a little bit at a time if the ransom don't come? Car. All this we do, and much more. We are devils of fellows! Toto. And then at night you sit round your fires in a cavern, and count your disgraceful gains? And you sing choruses, and have bands of bayadères to dance before you? Car. Yes, and we play for tremendous stakes, too! We think nothing of threepenny points, we devils don't! Now, once for all, if that girl don't put down that firearm, I shall go! Toto. Jelly, you're making the gentleman nervous. Do be quiet! And where are you going now? Car. I am on my way to join my band in my home. We have a little dance to-night. All the respectable brigands for miles round will be there. Toto. And you'll dance in the moonlight, I dare say? Car. Yes, the wild quadrille, the maddening Sir Roger de Coverley. Bless you, we devils don't care what we dance! Toto (suddenly). I'll go with you! Jelly. But your Highness— Toto. I'll go with him, and so will you! Now, don't stop to argue the point. When my mind's made up, all the talk in the world won't change it. Jelly. But think for one moment— Toto. I've no occasion to think! I'm my own mistress, and I can do what I like. That's the beauty of being single! We'll come for a week just to see how we like it. You have some elderly ladies there to make it respectable? Car. Lots of elderly ladies! Bless you, we devils don't care how elderly they are! Toto. Then that decides me. I'll come. The life will suit me exactly. The dress is picturesque, the occupation is healthy, I've plenty of pluck, and absolutely nothing to detain me here. What do you say? Car. My hand on it. (Aside) She's mine. (Whistles—the Stage is filled with Brigands.) FINALE. Toto, Jelly, Caramel, Jacquier, and Chorus. Toto. A hat and a bright little feather, A gun on my shoulder—so; A dagger in scabbard of leather, And a pistol for a foe. Like a daring mountain ranger From rock to rock I'll bound; In the foremost ranks of danger Your Toto will be found. Tutti. Then away to the mountain brow, With rifle and six-shooter; The life of lives, I vow, Is the life of a brave freebooter. (As they are going the Act drop falls.) End of Act I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene—A picturesque Mountain Pass. Jacquier, Floss, and other members of Caramel's court are discovered disguised as Brigands; they are engaged, when the curtain rises, in waiting on a very ragged old beggar, whom they have taken prisoner. They are supplying him with wine and other good things, and Jelly is superintending his comforts. A party of female Brigands dance before the old man at intervals, and all are vying with each other in ministering to him. CHORUS. Cheer up, old man—pluck up a heart; Cheer up, old man—soon you'll depart; Cheer up, old man—give us a smile; Cheer up, old man—'tis but for a while. SOLO.—Jelly. If he's feeling weak or fainty, Run and fetch a tonic dainty; If from want of food he drops, Feed him up with mutton chops. Tutti. With mutton chops. [Dance. CHORUS. Poor old man, Poor unhappy party, If you can, Make a dinner hearty. Come, cheer up, You shall go to-morrow; In this cup Try to drown your sorrow. Cheer up, old man, pluck up a heart, &amp;c. [At the end of Chorus Prisoner falls asleep. Jaq. Poor old gentleman, he seems quite comfortable now. Floss. Yes, he has forgotten all his troubles for the moment. How peacefully he slumbers! Jaq. Poor old boy! Jelly. What strange brigands you are! You take a penniless little boy, or a ragged old woman, and you feed them up and treat them so kindly that you've the greatest difficulty in inducing them to return to their friends; and when they do return, they give such a glowing account of your kindness, that the whole village comes in instalments to give themselves up to you. How many have you got now? Floss. We've thirty-seven. Jelly. And instead of cutting them up, and sending them home in little bits, they feed on the fat of the land, while you wait on them, and hope they are pretty comfortable. [During the last few lines Caramel has entered. Car. Well, you know, Jelly, prisoners are fellow-creatures after all, and they have their feelings like you and me. If we take them we are bound to look after them; you know the rites of hospitality must be respected. Jelly (sarcastically). Do you expect to get much ransom out of him? Car. That gentleman's mother is going to send five hundred thousand francs for him this very afternoon. (Prisoner wakes.) He wakes (all interested). Have you had a nice dinner, my good old friend? Prisoner. Pretty good; the mutton was rather tough. Car. Tough, was it? (To Floss) Now that's your fault. (To Prisoner) You see we've had such a rush of prisoners to-day, that our larder was exhausted; but it shall not occur again. Did you sleep pretty comfortably last night? Prisoner. Pretty well. I should like another blanket; it gets chilly towards morning. Car. You are quite right, it does get chilly towards morning; I feel it myself when I'm standing sentry over you to keep the wild beasts away. Jelly, see that the gentleman has another blanket. (To Prisoner) Go with Jelly, there's a good man. Jelly. Five hundred thousand francs! His mother must be very fond of him. If he were my son, I'd give five hundred thousand francs to get rid of him. [Exeunt Jelly and Floss with Prisoner. Car. Poor fellow! it goes to my heart to detain him; but when you're a desperado, you must act like a desperado. If I were to obey the natural impulse of my heart, Toto would detect the imposture in a moment. Re-enter Floss. Floss. Prince Caramel. Car. Hush! Barberini! the blood-thirsty Barberini, if you please. Floss. I beg your pardon: Barberini, I've bad news for you. Car. Bad news! Are the police upon us? Floss. No, but two more peasants have come to yield themselves prisoners. Car. Two more? How tiresome. We shall be eaten out of house and home. Where are they? [Floss beckons; enter two ragged and dirty Prisoners led by a Brigand. Car. (Aside) Humph!—not much to be got out of them. (Aloud) Well, gentlemen, what can we do for you? Second Prisoner. We've come to surrender. Car. But nobody asked you to surrender. Second Prisoner. No, but we feel that resistance would be useless; we are your prisoners, and we are very hungry. Prisoners. Very hungry, Car. It's extremely tiresome, but there's no help for it. If you are a desperado, you must behave like a desperado. I dine in half an hour, and they must dine with me. (To Floss) Take them away and give them a nice suit of clothes—I won't have them at my table in those rags—and here's an order for blankets, counterpanes, and feather beds. Do you prefer a feather bed, or a mattress? Prisoners. Feather beds is what we've been mostly used to. Car. Yes; so I should think. Perhaps you'd like a warm bath, gentlemen, before dinner? Prisoners. No, we don't seem to care much about a warm bath. Car. But, indeed, I think you'd better. You've no idea how refreshing a bath is now and then. Prisoners. But we don't want a warm bath. Car. (ferociously). Ha! rebellion! The brigand Barberini has spoken! Away with them, they shall be washed! [Exeunt Prisoners, followed by Floss. Jaq. Is there no sign of the Princess relenting? Car. My dear friends, your patience and devotion are about to be crowned with success. Congratulate me—I have at length persuaded her to consent to an immediate marriage. In half an hour we shall be made one, and to-morrow I shall break the truth to her that we are gentlemen of character, wealth, and position; that instead of a brigand's wife she is the bride of one of the wealthiest potentates in the world. All. Hurrah! Car. So go, and make your preparation for an early departure; at six o'clock to-morrow we start. [Exit. CHORUS.—Male Brigands. We are nobles all, though in brigands' disguise, All men of peace, though armed to the eyes; Forced to masquerade in ferocious attire— Not the sort of thing that we nobles admire. CHORUS.—Female Brigands. We are ladies all, and of gentle degree, Picturesque our dress, perhaps you'll agree; Forced to masquerade in this brigand attire— It's not the sort of thing that we ladies admire. For oh! this masquerade is Too hard upon us ladies; No more, forsooth, we'll brigands be, But end our lives respectably. Caramel re-enters after Chorus. Car. At last, at last! O Toto, what crimes I have committed for you! what risks I have run for you! Enter Toto. My darling, you look depressed, you have not repented your promise? Toto. No, but it's a terrible step to take; I've often thought over it, and wondered why a girl can't be happy without deserting the people who, for the last twenty years of her life, have proved themselves to be her very best friends—I often think of it. I once dreamt I was married. Car. Nonsense! Toto. Yes, to a beautiful young Prince named Doro. Car. (hurriedly.) Oh! it was only a dream. Toto (sighing). Yes, I know it was only a dream. He was a great deal too handsome to be true. One's only married to really handsome men in dreams. Car. (hurt). That's rather a reckless thing to say, Toto. Toto. It's quite true. Car. It may be true, but it's not pretty to say so. [Exit. SONG.—Toto. I have two worlds—I live two lives— One here, and one elsewhere; In both of them men marry wives, And love them here and there. This world that rolls about the sun With sin and sorrow teems; The other, and the fairer one, Is called the world of dreams. In that sweet land you rule the roast, Whatever rank you bear, For, come what may, you are the most Important person there. Whatever you may wish comes true, You always win your stake, And, should misfortune threaten you, You've only got to wake. Oh, if we, who are wide awake, And very shrewd and deep, Could wipe out every sad mistake By falling fast asleep; If from our folly we were freed Whene'er a nap we take, How very, very few indeed Would ever keep awake! Re-enter Jelly. Jelly. Everything is prepared for the wedding; the clergyman is ready, and the bridesmaids are ready, and we are only awaiting your pleasure. Re-enter Caramel, Brigands, Jacquier, and Floss. COUPLETS. Toto. At last I shall marry my own, For I love Barberini alone; It cannot too widely be known That at last I shall marry my own. Let everybody be gay, For I'm to be married to-day. Car. The brigand has chosen a bride, In a minute the knot will be tied; To be with a brigand allied, Is a very fine thing for a bride. Let everybody be gay, For I'm to be married to-day. Jelly. I wish that my turn it would come, But all of these brigands are dumb, I'd pay down a pretty large sum If it only would make my turn come. Let everybody be gay, For they're to be married to-day. [General dance and exeunt. Enter Doro. Doro. This must be the spot which was indicated to me as the halting-place of the brigand Barberini; but I see no signs of his presence. So, Prince Doro, your fortunes are about to take a decided turn for the worse; you are about to enlist yourself in the ranks of one of the most unscrupulous ruffians of modern times. You're a nice young man, Prince Doro, to declare war against your fellow-man, and in such disreputable society. Declare war against your fellow-man? Nothing of the kind, my fellow-man has declared war against me. Who induced me to fall in love with Toto? My fellow-man. Who married me to her? My fellow-man. And who bolted with her ten minutes after marriage? My fellow-man. My fellow-man has thrown down the glove, and in joining Barberini's band I only take up the challenge. Will he have me? Yes, I'm young, and strong, and brave, and I don't care twopence for my life—in fact I want to die, and if a man who wants to die won't make a good brigand, who will? Oh! I dare say it's very shocking, but I'm tired of life, and desperate; besides, there are plenty of brigands in broadcloth who hold up their heads in society, and I don't see that a scoundrel's any the worse for being picturesque. SONG.—Doro. There are brigands in every station, And robbers in every rank; Some plunder the wealth of a nation Some modestly pillage a bank; Some brigands are bubble directors, And others may wear a fez hat; They're out of the reach of inspectors, But they're none the less brigands for that. Oh, did you know all that I know, Your eyes would start out of their sockets; You'd take better care of your pockets, If you only knew half that I know. There are brigands well known as stock-jobbers, Who safely may follow their bent, While other respectable robbers Lend money at eighty per cent.; Then think of the swindlers, and plotters, The forgers, and robbers of banks, The murderers, thieves, and garotters Now walking about in your ranks. Oh, did you know, &amp;c. [Exit Doro. Shout outside. Re-enter Caramel and Toto. Toto. Married at last. Car. Yes, securely married at last. Toto. Dear husband! Car. Dear wife! Toto. To think that my dream is realized, and that I'm a real live brigand queen at last. I've longed all my life to be a brigand queen. Car. Yes, it's a delightful life—so comfortable. Toto. So unconventional. Car. So snug. Toto. So romantic. Car. So respectable. Toto. So—so honest. Car. Yes, “so-so” honest. Toto. Then there's such good feeling between you all. You all hang together so well; that's the best of it. Car. Yes, we shall all hang together, and that's the worst of it. Toto. The life suits me down to the ground. I shall live and die a brigand queen. Car. Quite so. But what a joke it would be if—if, I say—it turned out that we were not real brigands, but only respectable people, who were playing at brigands! I say if that were to take place, what a joke! O Lord, what a joke it would be! Toto (severely). You have a very grim idea of a joke. Car. Grim? Toto. Yes, grim, not to say ghastly. Car. Why, what would you do? Toto. Do? What would I do if I thought you had deceived me? Let me think;—in the first place I would shoot you. Car. Shoot me? Toto. Dead. Car. You're joking. Toto. Am I? Try. Car. But I only said “if.” Toto. I know you did; but “if” is quite enough. I am much obliged to you for the suggestion. It will be extremely useful to me in my profession. Car. How, useful? Toto. Why, thus. When I want to nerve myself to a deed of unusual daring, when I want to screw myself up to a pitch of remorseless fury, when I want to throw off the woman and assume the tigress, I shall only have to imagine for a moment that I have been made the victim of a practical joke. Do you understand? Car. I think I understand. Toto. Thoroughly. Car. Thoroughly. I was only joking. Toto. I am glad of it. [Exit. Car. Whew! Here's a pretty piece of business. Who'd have thought she had so much devil in her? And how is all this to end? I shall have to carry this sort of thing on to the end of my life; I'm committed to it.. We shall get into nice hot water with the police; I know we shall. Gracious goodness! if we should be taken up; she's always urging me to stop mail-coaches, and secure wealthy travellers. We shall catch a Tartar some day, as sure as a gun. Re-enter Doro. Car. (seeing him). We are lost; the police are upon us. Doro. Are you the ferocious Barberini? Car. (in terror). I am, but I have repented of all my crimes, and in a fit of remorse I was just going to deliver myself up to justice as you came in. Doro. I am sorry for that, for I came for the purpose of joining your band. Car. Then you're not the police? Doro. Not at all. Car. (fiercely). And yet you have dared, audacious mortal, to beard the ferocious Barberini in his den? Are ye not aware that none but the police are ever admitted into this lair? Are ye not terrified at the probable consequences of your presumption? Doro. Not a bit. You will no doubt be delighted to admit so promising a recruit into your band. I'm a dare-devil fellow, and whenever you have an expedition of unusual danger on hand, I only ask that you will place me at its head. Car. You seem to have a pretty good opinion of yourself, you do. Doro. No, I'm a reckless, desperate man. This is not courage, it is despair. I want to die. Car. If I can assist you in any way—(Offers him pistol.) Doro. You can. Appoint me your lieutenant. Car. I think you're a very pushing young man. Doro. Then you refuse to admit me into your ranks? Car. Yes, we've no opening for you at present. If any vacancy should occur, leave your address, and we'll let you know. Doro. Very good. Then, in the meantime, I suppose I must consider myself your prisoner. Take me; I surrender. Car. Now, look here! We don't want any more prisoners. We've more than we can manage already. Go away—we've nothing for you. You are a very pushing young man. Re-enter Toto. Toto. Stop; what is all this about? Doro (aside). Why, if I'm neither mad, nor asleep, this is my Toto. Car. This, Toto, is a forward young man, who wants to join our band. I've told him we have no vacancy, and he had better join his friends. Toto. You told him that? Car. Yes. Toto. You told that fine young man you didn't want him? Car. That is what I told him. Toto. Then you're a donkey. Come here, young man. Doro. She don't recognize me. She has forgotten her husband. Toto. I like your appearance—it pleases me. You're smart and active—I like your face; I fancy I have seen it before. Doro (aside). She fancies she has seen it before! And this is the wife to whom I was married only three days since. Toto. You seem to have all the qualities that should make an excellent brigand; I am Queen of the band, and I hereby admit you a member of it. Car. But, Toto, my darling, reflect. Toto. Silence! (To Doro) Behave well, show yourself worthy of promotion, and you shall have it. (Aside) I cannot think where I have seen that young man's face before. TRIO.—Toto, Doro, and Caramel. Toto. So take my hand, we are agreed; A brigand you will be indeed; It is a life you will adore. (Aside) I'm sure I've seen his face before. Doro. Three days ago the knot was tied Which constituted her my bride; Yet when we meet she isn't sure, But “thinks she's seen my face before.” Car. This conduct comes within the range Of that which is considered strange; She likes him well, and, what is more, She “thinks she's seen his face before.” ENSEMBLE. Doro and Caramel sing these lines mutatis mutandis. Toto. Oh matter perplexing, Annoying, and vexing; All over the world I'll explore— I'll travel, and travel, This knot to unravel, And learn where I've met him before. So take my hand, &amp;c. [Exit Caramel. Toto. I'll tell you what it is, my husband must be mad to reject such a promising recruit. You 're just the sort of man we want up here, for, between ourselves, our Brigands are not up to much. They're a very weedy lot; I have always great difficulty in spurring them up to anything like a deed of daring. Little girls sent out with halfpence to fetch milk; old ladies with their omnibus fares in their gloves; cans hanging on area railings, and so on. Such deeds as these—there's no disguising it—are not worthy of Barberini's band. (Aside) I can't think where I have seen his face before. Doro. Oh! Toto, Toto, have you forgotten me so completely? Learn that I who stand before you am no other than the cheated and discarded Doro. Toto. Doro? I know that name. Doro. Know that name? Perhaps you do. It is that of your husband. Toto (puzzled). My husband? No, his name is Barber—Stop, I know, you're my dream husband! Of course you are; how stupid of me, to be sure! Then let me see—I must be asleep, and this is a dream. Doro. A dream? Toto. Yes, I know it's a dream by you. Look here, I have two husbands. Doro (aghast). What? Toto. Two husbands. One when I'm awake—he's real; and one when I'm dreaming—he's sham. You're the sham one, you're an illusion (feeling his arm). Yes, you seem real, but you're not. Doro. If you've taken leave of your senses, allow me to bring them back to you. I am your real husband; real live flesh and blood. You're as wide awake as ever you were in your life, and that's not saying much. Toto. Then do you mean to say that—that I did not dream that we were married? Doro. Most certainly not? We were actually married, and immediately afterwards you vanished. Toto (crying). Oh dear, oh dear, I am so sorry! I—I quite forgot all about it. I—I remember it now. Oh dear, oh dear, I don't know what I shall do. You'll ne-ne-never f-f-f-forgive me, I know you won't. I've been a very naughty, ungrateful, forgetful girl, and I ought to be ashamed of myself. Oh, forgive me; do, do forgive me—I won't go and marry anyone any more. Doro. Forgive you! when you eloped with another man within ten minutes of your marriage? Toto. It was p-p-p-platonic. It was wrong of me, I know; but I acted on the spur of the moment. Doro. It is impossible to accept that excuse. Toto. But if I forgot, what was I to do? I suppose you forget sometimes. You're not absolutely infallible, I suppose. Doro. It is useless. Toto. Now, my own, own dearly-loved—darling, darling—I forget your name for the moment. Doro. Doro! Toto. Exactly, Doro! Now my darling Doro, don't, oh, don't blight my young life; don't ruin my hope of happiness; don't shroud my whole existence in gloom for a mere act of childish forgetfulness, for I love you, dear—dear—dear— Doro. Doro—take a card (gives card). Toto. I was going to say “Doro,” only you take one up so. Indeed, indeed, I love you very fondly; and, if you'll only forgive me, I'll be such a good little wife to you, and never cause you any sorrow any more (sobbing). Oh dear, oh dear, what shall I do? Doro. Poor little girl, she does seem very fond of me. Well, after all, it was only an act of forgetfulness. She forgot she was married. A good many highly respectable people make the same mistake. Besides, when a woman begins to cry, what is a man to do? (Aloud) There, Toto, I forgive you this once; but don't, oh, don't you ever, ever do such a thing again as long as you live. Toto. My darling husband! DUET.—Toto and Doro. Doro. My own, own love, my gentle wife, Devoted partner of my life, How sad a future mine would be, If it were passed away from thee! Toto. My own, own love, my husband dear, In all I say I am sincere; While in my bosom beats a heart We twain will never, never part. Doro. Oh gentle wife, Toto. Oh husband dear, Doro. My love, my life, Toto. I am sincere. Doro. Oh maid divine, Toto. Oh loving heart, Doro. Oh life of mine, Toto. We'll never part. [Exeunt together. As they go off the King enters with Zapeter and Jamilek from the bridge. They are disguised as Red Indians, and carry tomahawks, &amp;c. TRIO.—King, Zapeter, and Jamilek. With skip and hop, With jerky jump, We come down plop, And come down plump; We are installed In Indian rig, Our name is called Hop-pe-de-gig. Hoppedegig, Hoppedegig, Hoppedegig are we, Hoppedegig, Hoppedegig, From an isle beyond the sea, Hoppedegig, Hoppedegig, You think our colour's paint. Hoppedegig, Hoppedegig, I do not say it ain't. With feathers, paint, and patches And a tom, tom, tom, That with our colour matches With a tom, tom, tom, We'll sing unmeaning snatches With a tom, tom, tom, Till we are under hatches In a tom, tom, tom. With skip and hop, &amp;c. King (who preserves a stately and dignified air, notwithstanding his disguise). At last we are in the brigands' lair, and before many moments I shall have an opportunity of testing our scheme to lure back my thoughtless daughter to my arms. Zapeter, it is to your diplomatic brain that this experiment is due. It was you, my trusty and well-beloved cousin, who suggested that we should take advantage of her taste for novelty, and disguise ourselves as Red Indians, in the hope that the peculiarity of our appearance and the quaintness of our attitudes might fascinate her volatile mind—Zapeter, I cannot thank you too affectionately for the suggestion. Jam. But should the lynx-eyed maiden see through our disguise, and detect the imposition that we have practised on her? King. Oh, heavens! the laugh would then be turned against us. If ever it should get abroad that I, King Portico, have stooped to disguise myself in this mountebank's dress, to shave my head and paint my face, I should expire with confusion. If tidings of this unutterable degradation were to reach the ears of surrounding nations, I should never hold up my head again. (Suddenly) Zapeter, it is to your shifty and tortuous brain that this device, this monstrous device is due. If it should fail, before heaven, your head shall pay the penalty. Zap. Fear nothing, the wary paleface has diligently studied the works of Fenimore Cooper, and they have made him downy. He is familiar with the method of expression of his red brother, and the wary paleface courts investigation; his tread is the tread of the wild cat, his eye is the eye of the hawk, his jump is the jump of the opossum. Why should he tremble? The Unmitigated Blackbird has spoken. Wagh! King. And you, Jamilek, do you feel yourself equal to sustaining the character you have assumed? Jamilek (speaking in Hiawathan metre) Oh thou proud and mighty monarch; Monarch of a loyal people, Monarch of a thousand cities, Monarch of a spacious country Dotted with unnumbered villas, Villas standing in a garden, Villas both of brick and stucco, Villas with commodious stabling, Stabling for a pair of horses, Stabling with a man's room over, If you ask me if I'm equal To sustain the part of Red Man So as to defy detection? I would answer, I would tell you, If the being quite familiar With the metre and construction Of the poem “Hiawatha” Is enough to qualify me, Apprehend no kind of danger: For I'd give to Paw-puk-ke-wis, Pau-puk-ke-wis the great boaster, Or the lovely Mi-ne-ha-ha, Six to four and beat 'em easy! King. My true and trusty Jamilek, as for myself, fortified with the assurance that in assuming my present garb I have made myself sufficiently ridiculous, I will not further stultify myself by affecting a method of expression as artificial as it is inconvenient. I have stooped to this, I will stoop no lower. [Toto is heard singing without loudly. Zapeter listens with his ear close to the ground. King. What do you hear? (King and Jamilek are eager for a reply.) Zap. Softly, and the Red Man will interpret. His ears are long and his patience proverbial. (Listening while Toto sings very loudly.) It is the sound of a voice—as it articulates words, it is a human voice. (King and Jamilek surprised at Zapeter's keenness of ear.) It is fresh and bell-like, and therefore it is a young voice. It is a flexible soprano, and therefore it is a woman's voice—a young woman's voice—behold! (Toto runs on singing.) Said I not well? Wagh. King. It is our Toto. (King, Zapeter, and Jamilek strike attitudes.) Toto. Why, bless my heart! who are these? They're the funnies people I ever saw in the whole course of my life. King. (aside). Funny? Have I lived to be considered funny? Oh! the humiliation of it! And in this tom-fool's dress—and before my own daughter, too. (To Jamilek) Tell her who we are, for upon my soul I forget. Jam. (to Toto). Blushing maiden of the paleface, If you ask me to what nation, To what aggregate of people, We've the honour of belonging, I will answer, I will tell you: This is little Wappewango, Which in language of the paleface Means the consequential vulture; This is Pooby-Jubbegabo, Or the Abernethy Biscuit, I am Hicky-hawky-pawky, The Unmitigated Blackbird. [They all strike attitudes; the King quickly recovering himself and becoming dignified. King. That I should have lived to hear myself described as an Abernethy Biscuit. “Abernethy Biscuit.” Oh, it is hard—it is hard. Toto. And do you always paint your face? King (aside). To have to admit it to my own child. (Aloud) Yes, always. It—it—it is a sign of distinction. (Skips, then resumes dignity.) (Aside) A sign of distinction! bah, it is the sign of a mountebank. Toto. And where are you going? King. To—to the island of Brandee-pawnee. There are our wigwams, and our squaws—Wagh! Jam. Wagh! Zap. Wagh! Toto. And how do you intend to get there? King. A vessel is awaiting us at the nearest port. Toto. And you are quite primitive, and unconventional, and all that? King. Primitive? Unconventional? Look here! (They skip absurdly about stage.) Don't you call that unconventional? (Aside) Oh, degradation! Toto. That sort of thing is just what I've been seeking for years in vain. I have been educated in a court where such innocent gambols would be punished with instant death. I'll go with you! All (affecting surprise). What? Toto. I'll go with you; I'm tired of being a brigand, and there's nothing to detain me here—at least, I don't think so. (Reflecting) No, I don't recollect anything. No, nothing. Come along; I'm delighted at the idea. I shall wear feathers, and paint, and perhaps marry one of the tribe, and be a squaw. I've often wished I was married. I once dreamt I was married to a beautiful Prince, named— named—let me see—Doro. But that was only a dream. Come, if I'm to be a squaw, the sooner I'm a squaw the better. FINALE. Toto. Away, away to the Indian isle, Where the poo-poo sings in the trees, Where nature wears an eternal smile, And the palm-trees bend to the breeze. Tutti. Away, away, &amp;c. King, Zap., Jam. (Aside) Within our wile, In first-rate style Our Toto is entrapped. We softly smile, Although our guile May get our knuckles rapped. Tutti. Away, away, &amp;c. Re-enter Car., Jacq., Floss, Jelly, and all the Brigands. They see Toto and others on bridge at back. Car. (Recit.) Who goes there? I charge you stop! King (aside). The brigands, hold me or I drop. Car. What are you doing, Toto, what, oh! what? Toto. With these Red Indians I have cast my lot. Toto and Indians. Hoppedegig, hoppedegig, Hoppedegig are we, Hoppedegig, hoppedegig, From an isle beyond the sea, Hoppedegig, hoppedegig, You think our colour's paint, Hoppedegig, Hoppedegig, I do not say it ain't. Car. (furious.) Among you brigands is there one Who knows the way to load a gun? I freely promise half-a-crown To anyone who'll bring 'em down. All the Brigands. Among us brigands is there one, &amp;c. King, Zap., and Jam. (laughing). Not one, not one; Can load a gun; Not one, not one, Can load a gun. Jelly. You take a ball and powder. Which you ram to make it louder; If your enemy you'd cripple, Place a cap upon the nipple; Take aim, and pull the trigger, And he'll cut a pretty figure; If you hit him in the head, He will fall dead, dead. Hurrah! Hurrah! This one, this one Can load a gun. Male Brigands. Let us follow, Female Brigands. Let us follow, Male Brigands. Let us follow, Female Brigands. Let us follow. All the Brigands. Follow, follow. [But they don't follow. King, Toto, Zap., and Jam. If you stir a step, upon my word you'll rue it. Brigands. Follow, follow, &amp;c. [But they don't follow. Car. It's all very well to cry follow, But why the dickens don't you do it. ENSEMBLE. Car. and Jelly. Oh rage! oh fury! oh despair! I stamp my feet, I tear my hair; But never fear, My little dear; I'll bring her back again, I swear. All the others. With joy, with rapture, and with glee, We are as glad as we can be. All this will end, And we shall spend Our future lives respectablee. Tutti. Away, away to the Indian isle, &amp;c. They're going away to the Indian isle, &amp;c. (Jelly furious, Toto and Red Indians triumphant.) End of Act II.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene—A Tropical Island. The Court of King Portico are discovered dressed as Red Indians. CHORUS. Bang the merry tom-tom, sing the merry song, Wear a merry Indian smile, Pleasantly the merry moments fly along, On the merry Indian isle. SOLO. Coriander seeds, Glass and metal beads, Pretty little bells, Feathers, too, and shells. These the merry playthings of the merry throng, Bang the merry tom-tom, sing the merry song, Pleasantly the merry moments fly along On the merry Indian isle. Zap. Whew! That's hot work; but what's worth doing at all is worth doing well. When you're a Red Indian you must do as Red Indians do; and a Red Indian tribe without a war-dance were a degrading spectacle indeed. Follette. What a contrast to the ceremony and formality of our pompous court at home! But, for my part, I don't like living in the open air, and I should like to get home at once. Brown paint don't become me. Zap. Local colour, my dear, nothing more. Foll. Local colour is all very well, but a girl's complexion is her complexion. Zap. (dancing). Not always, my dear, not always. Foll. But her father has got her away from the brigand! Why don't he reveal himself and put an end to it all? Instead of which he makes us all disguise ourselves as Red Indians, and encamp on a desert rock ten miles from anywhere. Zap. All this is diplomacy. (Dances down.) Enter King Portico as Red Indian. He sees Zap. dancing ridiculously. He is much shocked. King. Zapeter! Zapeter, what are you doing? Zap. Sire, I am practising the war-dance of the tribe. King. It cuts me to the heart to see you, a man of high position and education—a minister, a grave, earnest gentleman—compelled to resort to such buffoonery. Zap. Sire, so great is our love to you, so earnest our desire that you and yours may be made happy, that we care little what personal humiliation we may undergo. (Dances.) King. My faithful friend! It now remains to be considered how we shall break the news to the Princess, that we have deceived her. Oh, Zapeter, I know her wayward temper well, and it will be necessary to proceed with the utmost caution. I dread the consequences of telling her that she must return with us to our court. Zap. But why return to your court at all? King. Eh? Zap. Why not live here for ever? You look a Red Indian! why not be a Red Indian? As for your kingdom, great as would be the pain of quitting you for ever, I would even return, and rule in your place; such, sire, is the love I bear you. King. My faithful and self-denying Zapeter, it is wisely and kindly proposed—we will think of it! But, soft, she approaches. [Chorus dance, and at end exeunt. Enter Toto. King. Ha! hum! The brow of the ha—palefaced young woman is clouded. Is anything wrong? Toto. Yes, I'm bitterly disappointed—and that's the truth. It has been the aim of my life to throw off the trammels of conventionality, and to revel in the society of barbaric man in all his primeval magnificence. I thought I had found it in the brigand's lair, but the brigand, imposing at a distance, turned out, on close inspection, to be a thing of petty fears, insignificant jealousies, and undeveloped intelligence. I thought I had found it among the Red Indians, but the Red Indians eat caviare, and shave with a Mappin's razor. His very tomahawk has the Birmingham stamp upon it. King. And yet we are considered a very fair representative tribe. Toto (contemptuously). A Red Indian with a double eye-glass. King. The fact is, that the hawk-eyed Red Man is getting on in years, and his eye-sight isn't what it was. There was a time when he could see the wind, when he had—a—no difficulty in following the flight of a bullet, when he was known as—as—Zapeter, what was I known as before my eye-sight went? Zap. You were known, sire, as “Pish-tush-pooh-bah,” or the Oxy-hydrogen Miscroscope. King. Exactly—a—that is what I was known as. Toto. Yes, I dare say you were all you say, but civilization has set its stamp upon you, and you interest me no more. True, you are called “Chumpee Choakee,” “The Abernethy Biscuit;” that sounds very well; but for anything primeval there is about you, your name might be Watkins, and you might keep a penny ice shop in the Borough road. Why, your very dinners are civilized: boiled mutton and caper sauce. Why don't the Red Man go and hunt the wild buffalo like a Red Man? King. Because, to be quite plain with you, I do not think the Red Man would succeed in capturing that animal. If the Red Man depended for his meals on the wild buffaloes he might happen to secure, the Red Man would go supperless to his—what do you call it? Toto. Wigwam. King. Wigwam—thank you, that is the word I wanted. Toto. But it's very easy! You've only got to disguise yourself in a buffalo's skin, and when you see a herd approaching, go up to them on all fours, bellowing like a bull. Now, do go and catch a wild buffalo. King. Never, never; now understand me, Toto, I will not do it. Toto. This is rebellion (retires up). King. Very likely. I can't help it, I will not catch a wild buffalo. Zap. (aside to King) Sire, I think if I were you I should humour her. King. Zapeter, I will not do it. I have stooped to much since I came here. I have painted my face like a clown in a pantomime, I have danced ridiculous war-dances, I have dressed myself in unpleasant skins that tickle dreadfully, but go on all fours bellowing like a bull— I will not do it. Jam. (who has been looking out at back). Sire, a boat is approaching the shore, and there are five strangers on board. What in the world shall we do? King. A boat with five strangers? Great Heavens! if they should happen to know me I should be a standing object of ridicule to the end of my days. We must conceal ourselves at once. Where can we lie hid? Jam. Sire, there is a thicket of prickly cactus within a few hundred yards. In that we might conceal ourselves till they depart. Toto. Prickly cactus! Oh, how horrid! King. Thanks, thanks, my trusty Jamilek. Your ingenious suggestions are always at hand in cases of emergency. Bless you, Jamilek! I do not altogether like lying down in prickly cactus, but there is no time to hesitate. To think that King Portico should have to stoop to such an expedient. Oh, Jamilek, if ever it should become known that I had consented to conceal myself in a bed of prickly cactus, your head shall pay the penalty. [Exeunt. Enter Doro, Caramel, Jacquier, Floss and Jelly, rowing in an open boat at back. BARCAROLLE. When you're afloat In an open boat, With nobody there to tow, You ply your oar Till you reach the shore, And that is all we know. When you're afloat in a sailing boat Which is much too big to row, You spread your sail To the quickening gale, And that is all we know. [Doro, Caramel and Jelly disembark, Floss and Jacquier row off. Car. At last, after a week's weary tossing in an open boat on a rough sea, we have arrived at our destination. Doro. Yes, this is no doubt the island which was indicated to us as that to which the ship sailed that conveyed the beautiful Toto from her unhappy husband's arms. Car. My kind friend. Doro. My devoted ally. Jelly (crying): My poor mistress! she was very kind to me. Car. Oh, she was a lovely woman! Doro. Lovely, indeed; to this moment the tears come into my eyes when I think of her. Car. My dear friend! (Aside to Jelly) This man's sympathy for my loss is inexplicable. He could not have regretted her more if he had been married to her himself. (Retires up.) Doro (aside to Jelly). Jelly, this good fellow's interest in my bereavement touches me here—here, Jelly. Such single-hearted sorrow for the misfortunes of a comparative stranger is simply phenomenal. My more than brother! Jelly. Now, this is very affecting. Each of these young men think that the other is helping him to discover his wife. They've been too sea-sick to compare notes, and when the truth comes out that Toto has married both of them, there'll be a row. [Exit. Doro (coming down, suddenly). Caramel, I will never desist until I have discovered Toto. Car. I am afraid you are giving yourself a great deal of trouble. Doro. Trouble! What is trouble when such an end is in view? Car. Well, you are the kindest-hearted fellow I ever met. Doro. Kindest-hearted? No, it is upon you the epithet should be conferred. I cannot tell you how I honour you for your efforts to discover her. Caramel, it is noble—noble. [Exit. Re-enter Toto. Toto. Why, whom in the world have we here? Car. At last, at last I've found her (clasping her in his arms). Toto, Toto, where have you been all this time, and what have you been doing? Toto (in his arms). I know your face somewhere. Car. To quit me as you did, within an hour of your marriage, and then to give me this hunt after you—oh, Toto, it's too bad. Toto. Stop a bit; let us understand each other. You are—let me see— Car. I am Prince Caramel, known to you as Barberini. Toto. Barberini! I know that name. (Suddenly) It's the brigand. Car. (hurt). Yes, it's the brigand. Toto. Let me see—didn't I marry you? Car. Yes, you did marry me, and you left me immediately afterwards with a parcel of Red Indians, and I've followed you ever since! And now I've found you, what have you got to say for yourself? Toto. That I'm very, very sorry. I remember it all now; but the Indians came, and they amused me, and when they asked me to join them I forgot all about you, and I went. But I'm very sorry, and I love you very dearly, and I won't run away any more. Oh dear, oh dear! if you only knew how I loved you, you'd forgive me. Car. (annoyed). Well I—now don't cry, I can't bear to see anyone cry. If you'll promise to return with me and never forget you've been married any more, why I'll try and forgive you. Toto. And never teaze me about it again? Car. No, the matter shall be buried and forgotten. Toto. Then I'm forgiven? Car. Yes (Kisses her.) Toto (in his arms). Quite? Car. Quite. SONG.—Toto. (First verse sung to Caramel.) I'm a foolish little maid, A garden growing wild; I cannot be demure and staid— I'm but a wayward child. My simple heart knows no deceit, It loves but thee alone, And while I live that heart will beat For thee, my own—my own. At the end of first verse Caramel turns up and goes off slowly as Doro enters. Doro comes down and Toto sings second verse to him, not noticing that any change has taken place. While borne from thee o'er many a mile Of cold and stormy sea, Although my lips have worn a smile My heart has ached for thee. If many a year had passed away And time had left his sign, And thou and I were old and grey, My heart would still be thine. [At the end of song he repulses her. Toto. There, now you're cross again. Doro. Cross? I should think so, to leave me as you did, with a set of strangers. I'll never forgive you, never—never— Toto. Why, you promised you would never refer to it again! Doro. I promised you that? Toto. Certainly! Now, do drop the subject, and don't refer to it again. Doro. Well, you're the coolest young lady I've met for some time. Toto (coaxingly). Now, Barberini— Doro. Barberini? I beg to inform you that my name is Doro. Toto. Doro, is it? Then why did you tell me your name was Barberini? Doro. I never told you so. Toto. Then I'm mixing you up with someone else. Doro. I object to that process. Toto. There is a brigand, Barberini, isn't there? Doro. There is just now, but if you mix him up with me, there won't be a brigand Barberini very long. Toto. I'll try and keep you distinct, but it's very confusing. Let me see—you wear that (tying a handkerchief round his arm), and then I shall know you. Doro. It shall never quit me while I have life. Enter Caramel, who comes down to the place Doro occupied. Toto (speaking to Caramel). Why, you've taken it off already. O you men, there's no trusting you! Car. I don't think I quite understand. Doro. Now you're mixing us up again. Toto. True. Caramel, get away, you're a dream. Car. A dream! Toto. A hideous dream. Doro. A nightmare. Car. But— Toto. Go away, I tell you. Don't come near me, If you speak another word I'll wake, and then where will you be? Car. False, fickle, perjured girl! I renounce you for ever! There is one lowlier in station, but lovelier in personal appearance, who tended me during the protracted agonies of the voyage, and to whom my heart will ever turn with sympathetic yearnings. I go to her—my own Jelly! [Exit. Re-enter the King. King. The crisis is at hand. The rain came as I was sleeping sweetly in the prickly cactus, and I forgot to bring the walnut-juice with me; there isn't a drop in the island. Re-enter Jelly and Caramel. Jelly. Why, that's never your majesty? Toto. Jelly! my dear Jelly, I am delighted to see you. Let me introduce you to our Ruler. Jelly. Bless you, I've known his majesty ever since I was born! Car. If you please, I had the honour of being betrothed to the Princess, but finding that she loves somebody else— Jelly. Why, he's going to marry me! Toto. Why, Jelly, you're never going to marry that! Why he's a dream! Re-enter Jamilek, Zapeter, and Court. King. Zapeter, how is this? You have removed your complexions! This is indelicate. Zap. Sire, it is of no use! The last shower was too much for us, and there is no colouring matter on the island. Toto. Why, what in the world have you been doing to yourself? Surely this side of your face is familiar to me? King. It is. I am your father, who practised a deception on you to bring you back to his arms. Will you forgive me? Toto. My father! (Is about to embrace him, but shrinks from painted side of his face.) No, the other side, please! King. And you forgive me? Toto. I have been very wilful and perverse and wayward, but now that I have a husband to look after me I won't give you any more trouble, as he will be always at hand to pull me up whenever I attempt to act on the spur of the moment. FINALE. Toto and Chorus. At last I shall marry my own, For I love my dear Doro alone; It cannot too widely be known, At last I shall marry my own. Let everybody be gay, For we're to be married to-day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHORUS. Bang the merry tom-tom, sing the merry song, Wear a merry Indian smile, Pleasantly the merry moments fly along, On the merry Indian isle. SOLO. Coriander seeds, Glass and metal beads, Pretty little bells, Feathers, too, and shells. These the merry playthings of the merry throng, Bang the merry tom-tom, sing the merry song, Pleasantly the merry moments fly along On the merry Indian isle.</field>
