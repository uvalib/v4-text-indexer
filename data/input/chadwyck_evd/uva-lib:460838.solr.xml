      <field name="fulltext">Dedication, by Vittorio Alfieri, to THE SECOND BRUTUS. TO THE FUTURE PEOPLE OF ITALY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. CÃ¦sar. Anthony. Cicero. Brutus. Cassius. Cimber. People. Senators. Conspirators. Lictors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Temple of Concord; afterwards the Curia of Pompey, in Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. CÃ¦sar, Anthony, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Cimber, Senators, all seated. CÃ¦. The dictator of Rome, illustrious fathers, To an assembly summons you to-day. 'Tis true, that CÃ¦sar seldom hitherto Hath thus collected you: the cause of this Alone hath risen from our common foes, Who would not suffer me to quit my arms Till I had first discomfited their ranks With indefatigable promptitude, E'en from the Betis to Egyptian Nile. At length 'tis granted to me to enjoy The privilege, which, more than all things else, I coveted, in Rome to avail myself Of Roman sense; and having first restored Rome to herself, to take advice from you Touching her welfare.âShe, from civil broils At length is respited; and now 'tis time That every citizen on Tyber's banks Should reassume his rights; and hence I hope That envious calumny may cease to rail. Rome is not, no, (as lying fame reports,) In any wise impair'd: at her sole name, Betwixt the Tagus and Euphrates, 'twixt The adust Siena and the ultimate, Unknown, sequester'd, hyperborean isle Of Albion, at her name all nations tremble. And since o'er Crassus he has been victorious, Far more the Parthian fears; the Parthian, Which at his victory, unlook'd-for, stands In blank astonishment, and fearing for it Chastisement from yourselves. To consummate Rome's glory, nothing else is wanting now Except to shew to Parthia and the world, That there those Roman soldiers (who required A Roman leader by the thirst of conquest, And not of gold, impell'd) were only slain, And not subdued. To wipe off this disgrace, And to conduct to Rome the Parthian king In fetters bound, or in the attempt to die, I now address myself. To treat maturely Of such a war, I have assembled you, Here, in this temple of auspicious name: May we infer from it a joyful omen; Yes, unanimity among us all Will be the only and authentic pledge Of our success. Wherefore do I exhort And counsel you to this. Our country's honour Summons us thither with imperious voice, Where her unconquer'd eagles have received Intolerable insult: and that honour Doth for the present absolutely silence All lesser impulses of every heart. The multitude collected in the forum Burns for revenge; from thence may each of us Their imprecations hear; from us they seek, And will perforce obtain it, punishment On the presumptuous Parthians. Hence should we, Waving all other subjects, first resolve How best this punishment may be inflicted. I first then challenge, from the flower of Rome, (And with a Roman joy I see that challenge Accepted almost ere it is promulged,) That hearty and unanimous consent, From whose reverberation speedily Each foe of Rome will be dispersed or slain. Cim. With so much wonder is my heart o'erwhelm'd, Hearing of this unanimous consent, That I first answer here, though I infringe Rigid prescription, younger than so many. To us to-day then, who have been already Mute by compulsion for so many years, To us is liberty of speech to-day Restored. I first then will attempt to speak; I, who beheld great Cato in my arms In Utica expire. Ah, were my thoughts Equal to his! If not in loftiness, They may be similar in brevity. Other abuses, other enemies, And other wrongs, far less endurable, Ere Rome bestows a thought upon the Parthians, She ought to punish first. The massacres Of Rome, e'en from the Gracchi to this time, Would furnish matter for a copious tale. Her forum and her temples, Rome has seen Her dwellings not less sacred, whelm'd in blood: With this is Italy, with this her seas Are all defiled. What portion is there now Of Rome's vast empire with the waste of blood Not reeking? Is this by the Parthians spill'd?â The formerly good citizens are changed To butchering ruffians; to atrocious swords The necessary ploughs; the sacred laws To chains and implements of punishment; The generals to ferocious despots: thus What more remains to suffer? what to fear? I then assert, that, to their pristine state, Ere aught is done, all things should be restored; And Rome should be regenerate ere avenged. An easy process to her genuine sons. An. I, consul, speak; to me it now belongs: Let him not speak, or if he speak be heard, Who to the idle winds doth bellow forth His pompous imbecillities.âOh fathers, In that which our invincible dictator Proposes to us now, 'tis my opinion (Although for private ends he may propose it) It is not so much question to restore Rome to its pristine glory, as to urge To that on which the safety, power of Rome, In short her very being doth depend. Did e'er a Roman leader unavenged In battle fall? Did e'er our ancestors Endure the opprobrium of an adverse battle Without retaliation? Hostile heads By thousands and by thousands did they not Atone, cut off for every Roman corse? Shall Rome now suffer that, since the confines Of earth and her supremacy are one, Which she would ne'er endure when limited Within the boundaries of Italy? And to her glory grant that she were deaf; Grant that we suffered with impunity The Parthian tribes their victory to enjoy; From such a precedent what obloquy, And more, what injury, would not accrue To Rome?âA numerous and a warlike people Dwell 'twixt the Parthian frontiers and our own. Who, who would bridle them, if it should cease, The salutary terror of our arms? Germany, Greece, Illyria, Macedon, Gaul, Britain, Africa, Iberia, Egypt, These martial tribes, which outraged and o'ercome, On every side surround us; would they serve Unwarlike Rome? No, not a day, ... an hour! Imperiously, besides your honour, then, An incontestible necessity Impels to Asia, to make war against it, Our haughty eagles. For the enterprize It now alone remains to chuse the leader. But who would venture to propose himself In CÃ¦sar's presence? Let us chuse another, On the condition, that in conquests, he, In finish'd wars, in victories, in triumphs, Surpasses CÃ¦sar, or that he alone In battle equals him. Of what avail Is creeping envy? CÃ¦sar, now, and Rome Are but one object by two names express'd; Since CÃ¦sar doth alone for Rome assert, For Rome maintain, the empire of the world. Then he is now his country's open foe, And a base miscreant, who would dare prefer, Envious, his private ends, minute and abject, To the common greatness and security. Cas. I am that miscreant then, yes, I am he, Whom he, that is a traitor, calls a traitor. I am the first to be so; 'tis my boast; Since CÃ¦sar now and Rome are but one thing Call'd by two names. Who to the purpose speaks, Speaks briefly. Others let them here repeat, In servile, artful, and unmeaning accents, The name of country: if there now remain For us a country, to the senators It doth belong over her state to watch: This in their name do I asseverate; But to true senators; and not like these, Convened fortuitously; for a vain form Summon'd to ridicule; and not like these Intimidated and encircled round By bullies and bribed satellites; and not Almost beheld and heard by citizens Bought and corrupted by their demagogues, Who feed them with vain words. Is this a people? This, that no other liberty esteems Or knows, except to be an obstacle To all that's great and good, to be a shield To all abuse? We now are told to look Amid the gladiatorial spectacles, Or from the tribute of corn-bearing Egypt, For Rome's lost majesty. From such a race First may we see the senate purged, and then May each of us be heard. My sentiments Meanwhile I think it fitting to premise; And 'tis, that there should be no dictator, Since we are not at war; that there should be Just consuls chosen; a just senate form'd; And that the forum should again behold Just people and authentic tribunes. Then Rome may deliberate on the Parthian war; Then, when by symptoms manifest, once more Rome by true Romans may be recognized. While of her former state we see a shadow, Her true and few remaining sons for her Will loyally to the utmost of their power Exert themselves, now her so many foes 'Gainst her to the utmost of their power are leagued. Cic. A son, and not ungrateful son, of Rome, More than myself I love her: and that day When from the impious hand of Catiline I rescued her, Rome hail'd me as her father. Remembering this, the sweet tears yet I feel Of gratitude and tenderness suffuse My swimming eyes. The public happiness, True peace, and liberty, have ever been, And are, my wish. Could I for Rome alone, And as I've always lived for her, expire! Oh what will be my gain, if for her sake Consumed, this remnant of a painful life I to her peace devote! I speak sincerely; My hoary hairs may well obtain belief. My language doth not tend to exasperate Him on the one hand, whom disdain, though just, Already has enough in soul embitter'd, From many and long-suffer'd injuries; Nor, on the other hand, to adulate The already sovereign arrogance of him Who deems himself without competitor. I speak to reconcile the good of Rome (If it be possible) with that of all. We have already for a long time seen The ill effects among us of the sword, Unholily laid bare. The names alone Of the ringleaders who infringed the laws Were changed, their aim unvarying, and each one Added to the accumulating ills Of the oppress'd republic. Who among us Sincerely loves his country; who in heart, Not in words only, is a citizen; Now my example let him imitate. Amid the rancour, hidden and profound, The manifest atrocious enmities; Amid the brandish'd swords, (if once again The raging furies venture to unsheathe them,) Let each of us expose his breast unarm'd. Thus will these frantic and discordant spirits Be laid at rest, or we alone shall fall Slain by their cruel swords; to their disgrace, Sole, genuine Romans, we.âThese are the thoughts, The aspirations, and the prayers are these Of one, a Roman citizen: do ye All listen to him equally: and who With too much glory is already laden, Let him not tarnish it, or lose it quite, By trying to no purpose to gain more: And who with envy sees another's glory, Let him remember that not envious thoughts, But lofty emulation in the contest Of real virtue, can alone augment His own pretensions, and without a stain, And laudably, diminish those of others. But since at home there doth so much remain To occupy our thoughts, I deem that we Ought, for the present, to let Parthian wars To nearer interests yield. Ah, may Rome be Harmonious by our means, and recomposed! And may the Parthians at one glance from her, And whate'er foreign foes she may possess, All disappear, like clouds before the wind. Bru. Cimber, and Cassius, and great Cicero, Their lofty Roman sentiments, so like True Romans have announced, that nought remains For him succeeding them to say of Rome. Nought now remains except to speak of him Who in himself has centred Rome, and now E'en deigns not to dissemble it.âTo thee, CÃ¦sar, since Rome in thee alone exists, I of thyself will speak, and not of Rome. I love thee not, and this thou knowest, thou Who lov'st not Rome; sole cause I do not love thee: I do not envy thee, because no more I deem myself inferior to thee, Since thou'rt become inferior to thyself: I do not fear thee, CÃ¦sar, since I'm always Ready to die rather than be a slave; And, finally, I hate thee not, because In nothing do I fear thee.âNow then, hear Brutus alone; to him alone yield faith; Not to thy servile consul, who so long By the reflection of thy virtues stands, While he with thee thy vices only shares, And seconds and augments them. Thou, oh CÃ¦sar, Perhaps yet deservest to be saved; (I think so;) And I would have it so; since thou so much, Wert thou reform'd, might'st benefit thy country: Yes, thou may'st do it, as thou hast been able To injure her so grievously already. This thy own people, (Cassius hath erewhile Pourtray'd it to the life,) this thy own people, A few days since, did somewhat disenchant Thy visions of supreme authority. Thou heard'st the cries of popular indignation, That day when, as in sport, the majesty Of the new consul gallantly attempted To round thy forehead with the royal wreath. Thou heard'st all shudder; and thy regal rage Blanch'd thy fierce countenance. But by thy hand The bauble was repell'd, which, in thy heart, Thou didst so ardently desire: from hence Thou wert assail'd with universal plaudits. But these same acclamations of thy people, Which, though in truth not really Roman, were not Infatuate as thou hadst wished them, Infix'd a mortal anguish in thy breast. That Rome might have a short-lived tyranny, Thou that day learnedst, but a king ... no, never! Thou know'st too clearly for thy inward peace, That thou art not a citizen: and yet, I also see it, that it weighs upon thee To be a tyrant; and for this, I think, Thou wert not born: thou see'st now if I hate thee. Reveal thou quickly then, if thou dost know it, To us and to thyself, that which thou think'st, That which thou hop'st to be. And learn thou now, If thou dost know it not, thou dictator, Learn from a citizen, from Brutus learn, That which thou meritest to be. Oh CÃ¦sar, A ministration far more glorious Than that which thou assumest doth await thee. Tyrant of Rome thou covetest to be; Presume, and thou shalt certainly succeed, To announce thyself as her deliverer.â Thou, by the freedom with which Brutus speaks, May'st clearly apprehend, that if of us Thou deem'st thyself lord paramount, as yet The bond of my allegiance is not seal'd. An. Of thy rash insolence ere long I swear The punishment ... CÃ¦. Let this suffice.âSo long, In hearing you with silence, have I given Of my forbearance no slight specimen: And should I hold myself of all things here The master, 'twould not misbecome me now; Since I with patience have not only dared To hear, but have provoked, th'audacity Of reprehensive tongues. Yet to yourselves This consultation seems not free enough; Although you have assail'd the dictator With insults, which he might or might not hear. I in the court of Pompey then invite you, Far from the forum, by to-morrow's dawn, To a more free debate, and without arm'd Attendants to defend you from the people. There, more at length, words more insulting yet, And more reproachful, shall I hear from you: But there too must the Parthians' destiny Be finally resolved.âIf it seem meet To the majority, that CÃ¦sar's fate Be also there determined, I dissent not, Provided that majority decree it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Cicero, Cimber. Cic. There does not now remain a safe asylum Save this, where we may treat o' the fate of Rome. Cim. Ah! little now is left for us to say; Actions alone remain for us. I have Invited hither to us in thy name Brutus and Cassius; soon will they be here. The exigence admits of no delay; Our country by to-morrow's rising sun Too certainly, alas! will undergo The last extreme of danger. Cic. 'Tis most true That the secure audacity of CÃ¦sar, Allowing no more to his vile designs Any delay, doth render on our part Further delay impossible. At length For nought he wishes but his troops in arms; Since from experience he is convinced That universal terror will do more To further his attempts, than the bribed love Of the unstable people. In his heart He laughs at our misfortunes; and lets us At leisure rail, provided he obtain His army: and of this he is secure From the majority of votes which he Has purchased in the senate. Afterwards At his return he'll be avenged on us For our last efforts in the cause of freedom His warriors he marches to the Parthians, To give the last shock to expiring Rome At his return, as formerly he gave To her, returning from the Rhine, the first. He hath advanced too far now to retract: Now even I confess that we cannot Longer delay with safety. But, alas! As a good citizen should do, I tremble: I shudder, to reflect, that, on an hour Fleeting, perchance, as that of our debate, The fate of Rome depends. Cim. Behold to us Cassius repairs. SCENE THE SECOND. Cassius, Cicero, Cimber. Cas. Have I come late? But ah, Brutus is not yet here. Cim. He comes ere long. Cas. Here many of our friends would follow me: But in these melancholy walls, are spies So much more numerous than good citizens, That, all suspicion wholly to prevent, I rather chose to come here unattended. To the unbending rectitude of Cimber, To Cicero's perspicuous intellect, Lastly to my implacable revenge, 'Twere now sufficient could we only add The sublime energy of Brutus' rage. Can e'er another council be convened Of nobler temperament than this, and hence Better adapted to exert itself For Rome's prosperity? Cic. Ah! may the Gods That watch o'er Rome will that it thus may prove! I, far as in me lies, do hold myself With hand, voice, heart, ready to serve my country. And I regret that there remains to me But a weak remnant of declining years To sacrifice for her. My wasted strength Can with my hand but little serve her cause; But if this tongue hath ever in the forum Or in the senate, the high sentiments Of freedom utter'd; more than ever yet, On this day Rome shall hear me thunder forth The same high sentiments of freedom: Rome, Whom I will not a single day survive, If she is doom'd to fall amid her chains. Cas. Thou always wert the sincere orator Of liberty; and by thy eloquence hath Rome Oft from her abject lethargy been roused: But who remains now that deserves to hear thee? All now are apprehensive, or are bribed; Nor, if they heard them, could they comprehend Thy elevated sentiments ... Cic. The people, Though no more Roman, is a people still: And though each man be in himself debased As far as man can be, the greater part, Soon as the multitude collects, is changed: I further would assert, that we may give them, When in the forum they're assembled all, A spirit altogether different From that which each 'mid his own Lares feels. Truth, falsehood, anger, pity, reason, grief, Justice, and honour, glory even yet, Are impulses, which, by the man who has them All truly in his heart, as on his lips, May be, yes all of them, at will transfused (Whate'er their individual character) Into the hearts of congregated thousands. I hope to-day to ascend, and not in vain, The rostrum, if indignant eloquence, Fervid and free, may aught avail; and there, If it be needful, I'm resolved to die. Say on what base was that prodigious power Of CÃ¦sar founded, which we all now fear? Th'opinion of the many. With the sword, 'Tis true, he conquer'd Gaul, but with his tongue, With plausible insinuating words, First o'er his legions the ascendency He gain'd, and o'er the people then in part: He could not purchase, or exterminate all, He only: but he easily could make, All those whom he had first inveigled, slaves. And cannot we then equally with him Make language instrumental to our purpose? Cannot we undeceive, illuminate, And medicate the heart and intellect Of all our fellow citizens? The truth, In such a contest, 'twixt my eloquence, And that of the tyrannical dictator, The truth would be on my side, force on his. And in the noble drift of my discourse Do I so much confide, that if but once I gain a hearing, I his weapons scorn. To hearts and ears that have been Roman once, Such fervid language I may yet address, That for a while at least they may become Romans once more. The character of CÃ¦sar Fully disclosed, and CÃ¦sar is no more. Cim. There is no doubt, but that if Rome could hear thee, Thy manly speech might rouse her to new life: But if thou also generously chose To ascend alone, and die upon the rostrum, For now to him 'tis fatal who dare breathe The name of freedom thence; if also thou Dared to do this alone; by the infamous, And purchased howlings of base parasites All means of being heard would be cut off. Those wretches now exclusively possess The bar of eloquence, and banish thence All upright orators. On Tyber's banks Rome stands no longer: it behoves us now In the remotest provinces to seek For arms, for virtues, and for citizens. A dire necessity, and this alone, Could justify us in recurring now T'intestine war; but yet this is not peace. We are compell'd once more with blood to purge Those rankling humours, which, oppressing Rome, Keep her exanimate 'twixt life and death. The illustrious Cato was a real Roman, And he detested uselessly to shed The blood of citizens: yet that most just Among just men, profess'd, that, ânursed in arms, And now by arms exhausted, arms alone Can now regenerate Rome.â What else remains For us to do? Or Rome is overcome, And with her fall all her true citizens; Or she's victorious, and the guilty ones Are all dispersed, annihilate, or changed. Has CÃ¦sar quite chain'd victory to his car? Let him be only once discomfited, And e'en his very partizans, convinced That he is not invincible, will then With other eyes behold him; with one voice All will then dare to execrate his name, And, as an impious tyrant, to proscribe him. Cas. Why first by us should he not be proscribed? When we ourselves should give it, when ourselves Should be the first to execute the sentence, From a vile populace should we expect it? While at our will, e'en in the midst of Rome, Within her dwellings, in the very senate, We may thus cope with CÃ¦sar, and obtain O'er him a complete victory; in the camp, Ought he, and at the risk of many lives Less impious than his own, to be provoked By us to dangerous and uncertain fight, Perhaps to be the victor?âWhere a sword, This sword of mine alone, and this my fierce, Inexorable rage that makes me wield it, Suffice, more than suffice, to annihilate That despicable life, which holds all Rome In tears, unworthily enslaved and chain'd; Where nought is wanting to destroy the tyrant Whoe'er he be, except a single sword, And one, a Roman, that may brandish it; Wherefore should we unsheathe so many?âAh! Let others sit in council, weigh, discuss, Delay, and waver till they miss the time: I, among all schemes, deem the briefest best; And now especially since the most brief Will be the boldest, noblest, and most sure. Worthy it is of Rome to slay this one Openly; and by the hand of Cassius CÃ¦sar deserves to die. To the just rage Of other men I leave the punishment Of th'infamous slaveâconsul Anthony.â Lo, Brutus comes: ah, let us, let us hear, If he dissents from me. SCENE THE THIRD. Brutus, Cicero, Cassius, Cimber. Cic. Does Brutus come So late to such a lofty conference? ... Bru. Ah! I had been the first there, if erewhile I had not been prevented ... Cim. And by whom? Bru. Not one of you could guess.â'Twas Anthony That would at length address me. Cic. Anthony! Cas. And the vile satellite of CÃ¦sar gain'd An audience from Brutus? Bru. Yes, he gain'd it, And in his CÃ¦sar's name. He would confer With me, at all events; and he invites me, If I consent to it, to come to him; Or he to me ... Cim. His offer was rejected? ... Bru. No. CÃ¦sar as a friend, in my pure heart Wakes no more fear, than CÃ¦sar as a foe. Hence I will hear him, and ere long, and in This very temple. Cas. What can be his wish? Bru. Perhaps, to bribe me.âBut ye still, I hope, Confide in Brutus. Cas. More than in ourselves. Cim. In Brutus all confide; e'en the most vile. Bru. And to provoke me, in respect of deeds, (As if I slept) I met with on my road Exciting exhortations scatter'd round me, Strong, brief, and Roman; and at once expressive Of praise and blame towards me, as if I were Slow to do that which Rome expected of me. This I am not: and every stimulus Applied to me is idle. Cas. But, I pray thee, What hop'st thou from this interview with CÃ¦sar? Cic. Thou hop'st perhaps to change him ... Bru. I am pleased That the sagacity of the great Cicero, My scheme in part conjectures. Cas. Oh! what say'st thou? We all, long time expecting thee, have here At length express'd our sentiments: we all, In hating CÃ¦sar, and in loving Rome, In being willing for her sake to die, Were as one man: the end of all the same. But in the best means to obtain that end Our sentiments were threefold. To resort To legislative strife; to rouse from sleep The people, by imposture drugg'd, to arms; Or with the private sword to immolate CÃ¦sar in Rome: now which of these would be The choice of Brutus? Bru. Mine?âNot one of these At present. If mine afterwards proved vain, I would undoubtedly adopt the last. Cas. And thine?âWhat other then remains to us? Bru. To you I'm known: I am not wont to speak In vain; be pleased to hear me.âRome is now Far too infirm to be in one day cured. The people might be roused, but briefly roused, To virtue: never with the bait of gold Are they, as they are drawn to baseness, drawn To rectitude. Can real excellence Be ever purchased? The corrupted people Would form a treacherous basis for fresh freedom. Perhaps the senators are less infected? One may enumerate the upright ones; The guilty also in their hearts hate CÃ¦sar, Not because he robs all of liberty; But because he prevents, (a single tyrant,) Their being tyrants in their turn. To him They would succeed; they envy, hence, and hate him. Cic. Ah, were this not, as 'tis indeed, too true! Bru. Amid such vices the good citizen Should steer with care, lest he to bad add worse. CÃ¦sar, though now a tyrant, was not once so. The impious wish to be lord paramount Hath only lately risen in his heart: And the vile Anthony, by stratagems, Adds fuel to his flame, to drag him on To his perdition, that he thus may rise Upon his ruin'd fortunes. Friends like these Fall to the lot of tyrants. Cas. In his breast, Connatural with his being, evermore CÃ¦sar possess'd the thirst to be supreme. Bru. No; not to reign supreme: he never dared To wish for so much. Now thou deemest him More bold, more lofty, than he ever was. Ambition, a necessity for fame, An ardent spirit, and no lofty wish To be avenged on private enemies, And lucky opportunity, at last, More than aught else, have to that height impell'd him, At which when now arrived, he feels himself Astonish'd at his own temerity. A thirst for honour more than thirst for power Still, in his heart, maintains ascendency. Should I prove this to you? Does he not now Pant to attack the Parthians, and to quit Rome where he still possesses many foes? Cim. He hopes to purchase with the Parthian laurels The royal crown. Bru. Then he would rather be To valour than to force indebted for it: He is thence more ambitious than corrupt ... Cas. Dost thou to us pronounce his eulogy? ... Bru. Hear the conclusion.âCÃ¦sar wavers still Within himself; he wishes yet for fame; He is not therefore yet, in heart at least, Consummately a tyrant: but, he now Begins to tremble, and a short time since He knew not fear; He then approaches near The brink of tyranny. A few days since Terror assail'd him, when he saw the crown By his bribed people from his grasp withheld. But CÃ¦sar, be he what he may, as yet Is not contemptible, is not unworthy That others should facilitate for him The path of reformationâFor myself I must despise myself, or him esteem, Since I consented for the gift of life To be indebted to him, on the day When, in Pharsalia's fields, a vanquish'd foe, Within his power I fell.âI live; and this My life is a sufficient blot to Brutus; But without baseness or ingratitude I will devise the means that blot to cancel. Cic. Such often is the fate of war: thou thus Hadst also used thy victory o'er him, If thou had'st conquer'd. Did not he himself, Once as a gift receive that life, to Rome Now so disastrous? Yes, did not he also Receive it as a gift from Scylla's hands By express grace, and far more express error? Bru. 'Tis true; but never does my mind forego The recollection of a benefit. Yet at the same time do my country's claims, And my own duties, in my heart sink deep. In short, to Brutus, CÃ¦sar such appears, That, (as he is, as now from day to day He more becomes,) a tyrannous dictator, Brutus, on no condition, will permit His life to be prolong'd; or he will kill him, Or he himself in the attempt will fall ... But such to Brutus CÃ¦sar also seems, That he alone to Rome can now restore, If he once more become a citizen, Liberty, empire, energy, and life. He is e'en now the idol of the people; Let him become a model to the good; Let him against the guilty arm the laws With added terrors; till the whole returns To its original state, be all his power Concentred to prevent those sons of faction, From ruining those laws. He was endow'd With lofty thoughts; he was a citizen: For fame he burns yet: he is blinded, yes; But such from prosperous fate, and impious friends, Who have alone made him forsake the path Of real glory, such from these alone Is he become.âOr nothing is my speech, Or I shall know how from my breast to draw Such strenuous and impressive words, to use To him such true, such strong, tremendous reasons, And in such numbers use them, that I hope, Yes I indulge the hope, to force e'en CÃ¦sar; To make him great indeed, so pure in virtue, That he o'er every man, o'er every Roman, Will rise unparallel'd in excellence, Yet be a simple citizen of Rome.â I only do prefer his fame to mine, Hoping that fame may benefit his country: And this my enterprize, methinks, affords Convincing proof of my sincerity.â But, if in vain Brutus speaks now to CÃ¦sar, Thou seest it, Cassius, thus I ever wear it; Behold the dagger, which will be more swift To slay him than thy sword ... Cic. Oh genuine patriot! Thou art too great; ill canst thou comprehend The tyrant CÃ¦sar, judging from thyself. Cas. Illustrious Brutus, an impossible thing, But worthy of thee, thou projectest: one Thou only could'st attempt. I oppose not Myself to thee. Ah, CÃ¦sar fully can, And he alone, divest thee of thy error. To change a tyrant to a citizen? 'Tis in itself proof, this thy generous hope, Oh Brutus, that thou ne'er could'st be a tyrant. Bru. That will be soon made clear: myself hereafter Will give you full account of all my deeds. If I, a vain, abortive orator, Oh Cassius, prove; so much more shalt thou have me, I swear to thee, obedient to thy orders, A lusty and a fierce tyrannicide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. CÃ¦sar, Anthony. An. CÃ¦sar, yes, soon will Brutus come to thee Within this very temple, where erewhile Thou didst consent to hear and tolerate His arrogant harangues. Ere long shalt thou Hear him, since thus thou wilt, as man to man. CÃ¦. I hold myself for this to thee indebted; 'Twas not an easy undertaking now To persuade Brutus to confer with me; Nor had I dared to trust to any one Except thyself an embassy like this. An. How much it grieves me, that to my entreaties Inexorably deaf, thou dost persist This Brutus to support! This is the first Of all thy wishes, with which Anthony Reluctantly complied. Yet in the guise Of amity, and in thy name, I stoop'd To supplicate him whom I know to be, By certain proof, thy mortal enemy, And whom as such I utterly abhor. CÃ¦. Many hate CÃ¦sar; yet, one man alone I deem a foe that's worthy of myself: And he is Brutus. An. Thence, not Brutus only, But Brutus first, the Cassii, and the Cimbri, The Tullii, and so many more should die. CÃ¦. The more embitter'd, lofty, strong my foe, So much more pleasure do I always take In overcoming him; and oftentimes More, than with arms, with pardon have I done this To have recourse to reconciling words, When I have power to arbitrate by force; Persuade, convince, and captivate a heart That swells with hate; to make that man my friend, Whose very being I could crush to nought; Ah, this against a worthy enemy, This is the most illustrious revenge; And it is mine. An. Let CÃ¦sar learn to be Great from himself alone; nature for this Intended him: but how at once to make Rome and himself secure, let him be taught To-day by him who loves them both alike: And above every man, that man am I. I ne'er shall cease reminding thee, that if Thou slay'st not Brutus, thou art herein check'd More by thy vain and individual glory, Than by thy real fondness for thy country; And that thou manifestest little heed For the security of both. CÃ¦. Would'st thou CÃ¦sar intimidate with base suspicion? An. If CÃ¦sar will not for himself, for Rome He might, and ought to tremble. CÃ¦. CÃ¦sar ought To die for glory, and for Rome; but never To tremble for himself, never for her. I in the camp the foes of Rome have conquer'd; These were the only enemies of CÃ¦sar. 'Mong those, who against her the sword unsheathed, Was Brutus; I already, arms in hand, Have, as a foe, o'ercome him, and e'en then With the just sword of war I slew him not; Now in the walls of Rome, oh heaven! unarm'd, Shall I now cause him to be murder'd, I With the insidious and guilty dagger, Or with the unjust axe?âThere is no cause, That ever could to such an outrage goad me: And even if I wish'd it; ... Ah! perhaps ... I could not ... do it.âBut yet finally, To my so many triumphs, that o'er Brutus, That also o'er the Parthians, are wanting: The one shall be the instrument to the other. I will make Brutus, at all risks, my friend. At present more than every other object The meditated vengeance for the death Of murder'd Crassus, weighs upon my thoughts; And in the enterprise, in which at once The fame of Rome and CÃ¦sar are involved, Brutus may much assist me. An. Thy renown Canst thou increase? CÃ¦. While there remains aught more For me to do, I deem what I have done A nothing: such my nature is.â'Gainst Parthia An impulse irresistible impels me. Shall Rome, while CÃ¦sar lives, be ever conquer'd! Ah! let him perish first a thousand times. But while I fight in Asia, I ought not To leave the city full of factious spirits, And humours rankling and unreconciled; Nor would I leave her full of blood and terror; Though this may be the most effectual means To render her submissive.âBrutus only Can level all for me ... An. Then Anthony Thou deem'st a thing of nought? CÃ¦. âPart of myself Art thou in all my military projects: Hence at my side still I wish thee to be The terror of the Parthians. I propose In other ways to avail myself of Brutus. An. I am prepared by every means to serve thee; And this thou knowest. But thou art too blind As respects Brutus. CÃ¦. He is far more blind As respects me, perchance. But this, I hope, Will be the day when I may undeceive him: I'm forced to-day at least to make th'attempt. An. Behold him here. CÃ¦. Now leave me with him; soon Hence will I come to thee. An, Ah, mayest thou Completely extricate thyself from error; And him in time, too, thoroughly detect. SCENE THE SECOND. Brutus, CÃ¦sar. Bru. Oh CÃ¦sar, we are ancient foes: but thou Art hitherto the conqueror; and yet Thou seem'st the happier. But I am still Than thou less wretched, though I seem the conquer'd. But whate'er be our state, o'erwhelm'd, oppress'd, Conquer'd, infirm, exanimate is Rome. An equal impulse, though from different motives, Has hither brought us to confer together. Thou hast important things to say to me If Anthony speak the truth; and also I Come to impart to thee important things, If thou dare listen to them. CÃ¦. Although Brutus Hath ever been my foe, I ne'er was such, Nor am I now to him; nor, if I would, Could I be ever so. I to thy dwelling Would have myself repair'd to speak with thee; But I shrunk back lest it might be by thee Deem'd an indignity, if CÃ¦sar dared To go, where, as the wife of Brutus, dwells The sister of great Cato: hence I sent Earnest entreaties to thyself to come Hither from thence.âMe, without any pomp Thou seest alone, by lictors not preceded; In all thy equal, Brutus; if indeed Thou scorn me not as such. Here thou wilt hear Nor Rome's dictator, nor the conqueror Of the illustrious Pompey ... Bru. The only train Not unbecoming CÃ¦sar is his valour: And more especially when he presents Himself to Brutus.âHappy thou, if thou Could'st also leave behind thee, as thou canst Thy lictors, and their fasces, the remorse, And the perpetual and cleaving terror, Of a perpetual dictator! CÃ¦. Terror? ... This is a word not even to my ears, Much less then to my heart, yet known. Bru. It was Unknown to mighty CÃ¦sar in the camp, Invincible as a leader; it is not To CÃ¦sar in the walls of Rome, by force Now her dictator. To deny this to me CÃ¦sar is too magnanimous: to me He may confess it without shame. To dare T'acknowledge this to Brutus, in itself Will constitute no small part of his greatness. Let us speak frankly: it becomes us both.â One individual never can impress A multitude with fear, till he himself Has previously felt it. To prove this, Hear what is now thy state of mind towards me. Thou without opposition may'st kill Brutus: Thou knowest that I love thee not; nay more, Thou knowest I may be an obstacle To thy iniquitous ambition; yet, Why dost thou not do this? Because thou fearest, That if thou kill'd me now it might increase Thy own perplexities. Thou would'st meanwhile, Hear me, and speak with me; because that fear Is now thy only law; nor this perchance Thou know'st thyself; or flyest the conviction. CÃ¦. Ungrateful! ... In Pharsalia's field was not Thy life within my power? Bru. But thou inflamed With glory, and yet glowing from the battle, Wert noble then; and thou wert born to be so; But thou from day to-day here more and more Sinkest beneath thyself.âReform, and know That thou wert never born to be a cold, Pacific tyrant: I affirm it to thee ... CÃ¦. Thy praise, though mix'd with insults, pleases me. I love thee; I esteem thee: and I would Be Brutus only, if I were not CÃ¦sar. Bru. Thou may'st be both; to Brutus may'st thou add, And nothing take from CÃ¦sar: I come to thee Myself, t'exhort thee to it. It depends On thyself only to be great indeed: Yes, thou may'st be so, even far beyond Each ancient mighty Roman: and the means Are very simple; dare to adopt them then: I first to this conjure thee; and I feel, As I address thee, with true Roman tears Mine eyes suffused ... But, ah! thou speakest not? Thou know'st well what my lofty means would be: Thou feel'st it in thy heart, the cry of truth, That there imperiously fulminates. Be bold, be bold; shake off thy abject chains, That make thee nothing e'en in thine own eyes; Which keep thee, more than others thou could'st keep, Enslaved and bound. To-day from Brutus thou Learn to be CÃ¦sar. If of thy renown I were invidious, would'st thou hear me now Beseech thee to annihilate my own? I know the truth; I flatter not myself: I am in Rome inferior to thee In dignity, in years, in power, and triumphs, As well as fame. If by my single efforts The name of Brutus could be signalized, 'Twere only possible for this to be By the entire destruction of thy name. A timid and a whispering voice I hear, A voice thence not legitimately Roman, Proclaiming Brutus Rome's deliverer, As it calls thee her tyrant. It is needful To make me such, that I defeat, or slay thee. No light achievement is the first; the second Is far more easy than thou canst believe: And if I had thought of myself alone, I had already been without a master: But I, a Roman, think of Rome; and chuse Thee to solicit, when I ought to slay thee, For her sake only.âYes, ah CÃ¦sar, thou Convinced by me, should'st be compell'd once more To be her citizen. To Rome thou canst, Thou first, thou only, more effectually A thousand times, than Brutus can, thou canst To Rome restore the whole; peace, liberty, Salvation, and a renovated lustre, In short, as much as thou hast taken from her. Yet, for a little time, thy royal power Do thou, though as a citizen, exert, In reinforcing her enfeebled laws, In taking evermore from all the courage, And means to imitate thee as a tyrant; And thou wilt thus at once from all have taken, As far as they are Romans, the presumption To emulate thee as a citizen.â Now, tell me; dost thou think thou art less than Sylla? He, far more guilty than thyself, more cruel, Embrued, and gorged with more abundant blood, He, yet presumed to be a citizen, And was illustrious.âOh! how much more so Would CÃ¦sar be, who has so much surpass'd Sylla in power! Greater, far greater then Would be thy glory, if thou freely render, What power and artifice have given to thee, To her, thy country, whose sole right it is; If thou knowest better how to prize thyself; If thou, in short, preventest that henceforth In Rome to all eternity arise Another CÃ¦sar, and another Sylla. CÃ¦. âSublime and ardent youth; thy eloquent And fervid exhortation, is, perchance, But too, too true. Thy sentiments produce Unspeakable emotions in my heart; And then when thou call'st thyself less than me, Thy great superiority I feel E'en to my own confusion. But to be The first myself to confess this to thee, And not to be offended when I do it, And not to hate thee for it, ought to be To thee a certain, and a lofty proof That in my bosom I conceive for thee Some unexplain'd affection.âThou art dear To me, believe it; thou art very dear. That which I have not time to accomplish now, I will that, after me, it be by thee Accomplish'd more effectively. Consent That to my many trophies I annex Those of the vanquish'd Parthians, and I die Contented. Great part of my life have I Pass'd in the camp: the camp alone would be To me a worthy tomb. 'Tis true, I've robb'd her In part, of freedom, but in more abundance I have increased for Rome her power and glory. Oh Brutus, at my death, thou wilt repair, Beneath the shadow of my victories, The wrongs which I have done to her. In me With safety Rome no longer can repose. The good which I would do to her, would be, By what I've done of evil, evermore Tarnish'd and poison'd.âThence I've chosen thee As the physician in my secret thoughts, For her internal wounds: thou ever wert Upright and great; and better than myself, The Romans thou canst make illustrious: And thou, their perfect sanity restore. I, as a father, speak for thee; ... and thou, More than a son, oh Brutus, art to me. Bru. ... This thy discourse I scarcely comprehend. To me in no wise justly can devolve Thy illegitimate, extinguish'd power. But what? Already speakest thou of Rome, As a paternal heritage? ... CÃ¦. Ah! hear me.âI From thee no longer can a subject hide, Which, when once known to thee, entirely ought To change thee in my favour. Bru. Change thyself, And I at once am changed; conquer thyself; The only triumph that remains for thee ... CÃ¦. With different eyes, when thou hast heard this secret, Wilt thou behold me. Bru. I shall ever be A Roman. But explain thyself. CÃ¦. ... Oh Brutus, In my deportment towards thee, in my looks, And in my accents, in my very silence, Say, dost thou not perceive that towards thyself Boundless affections influence and transport me? Bru. I see in thee I know not what emotion; And from the man they rather seem to spring Than from the tyrant: feign'd, I cannot think them; Unfeign'd, to what I know not to impute them. CÃ¦. ... But thou, what impulses dost thou experience, Towards me within thy bosom? Bru. Ah, a thousand! And for thyself alternately I prove All impulses, save envy. I know not How to express them; but in two I class them: Anger and horror, if thou'rt still a tyrant; If thou becom'st a man and citizen, Thou dost inspire me with unbounded love Mix'd with astonishment. Which of these two Would'st thou from Brutus? CÃ¦. Love. To me thou ow'st it ... A sacred, and indissoluble tie Binds thee to me. Bru. To thee? What can this be? ... CÃ¦. Thou art my son. Bru. Oh heaven! What do I hear? ... CÃ¦. Ah, come, son, to my breast ... Bru. Can it be so? ... CÃ¦. If thou believ'st this not from my report, Thou from thy mother surely wilt believe it. This is a letter from her; in Pharsalia, A few hours ere the battle, I received it. Behold; her hand is known to thee: peruse it! Bru. (Reads the letter.) âCÃ¦sar, oh heaven! thou dost perhaps prepare, âNot only with thy fellow citizens, âAnd Pompey to wage war, but with thy son. âBrutus is th'offspring of our youthful loves. âI am constrain'd to make this known to thee; âTo this confession nothing could have wrought me âExcept a mother's fears. Thou shudderest, CÃ¦sar; âSuspend, if time be yet allow'd, thy sword: âThou by thy son may'st be destroy'd; or thou âThyself with thy own hand may'st slay thy son. âI tremble ... Oh may heaven grant that in time âA father may have heard my word! ... I tremble ... âServilia.ââFierce and unexpected blow! The son of CÃ¦sar, I? CÃ¦. Ah yes! thou art. Come to my arms, ah come! Bru. Oh Rome! ... oh father! ... Oh nature! ... oh my duty! ... âEre I clasp thee, See, at thy feet a suppliant Brutus falls. Nor will he rise, if he do not embrace In thee the father of himself ... and Rome. CÃ¦. Ah, rise, oh son!âhow canst thou ever thus With such ferocious coldness freeze thy heart, That nature's first affections sway thee not? Bru. And what, dost thou pretend to love thy son? Thou lov'st thyself; all feelings in thy heart Are to the love of rule alone subservient. Prove that thou art a citizen and father; The last a tyrant never is: ah prove That thou art such, and thou wilt find in me A son. Twice give me life: Brutus a slave Can never be; tyrant he will not be. Or Brutus is the son of a free father, Himself free also, in free Rome; or Brutus Will not exist. I'm ready to shed all My blood for Rome, and for thyself, if thou A Roman be, a father worthy Brutus ... Oh joy! a noble tear do I behold Start from thine eye? The icy crust is snapp'd In which thy heart was cased; thou'rt now a father. Ah! hear thou by my lips the cry of nature; And Rome and Brutus shall for thee be one. CÃ¦. ... My heart thou rendest ... Fierce necessity! ... I cannot now exclusively obey The emotions of my heart. Beloved Brutus, Hear me. Too far the servitude of Rome Is now advanced; with less of equity, And with more injury to herself, will others The reins of empire sieze upon, if now Brutus refuse them from the hands of CÃ¦sar ... Bru. Oh trait'rous words! Oh infamous expressions Of a corrupted and degenerate mind! To me thou never wert, nor art a father. Ere thou revealed'st thy ignoble heart, And my vile birth to me, had thy own hands Cut short my thread of life, that act had been Of kindness more expressive ... CÃ¦. Oh my son! ... Bru. Oh CÃ¦sar, yield ... CÃ¦. Unnatural, ... ungrateful ... What then wilt thou perform? Bru. Or rescue Rome, Or in the attempt expire. CÃ¦. I will reclaim thee, Or perish by thy hands. Unparallel'd And horrible is thy ingratitude ... Yet, hence I hope that horror and repentance Will visit thee, or ere to-morrow's dawn Shall see us in the senate house convened. But if thou then, ungrateful! still persist Not to accept me for a father, then, If, as a son, thou still disdain to share With me the whole, on that same dawn shalt thou Find me again thy lord. Bru. Ere then, I hope, The horror and the shame to have found thyself A tyrant to no purpose, will have changed thee To a true father. In my breast at once The affection of a son cannot arise, If first thou do not give to me a proof Sublime and strong of thy paternal love. A father's is the first of all affections; And in thy heart it ought to conquer. Then The most submissive, the most tender son, The most affectionate that e'er was seen, Then wilt thou find in me ... In being thy son What joy then, what devotion, and what pride, Oh father, shall I feel! ... CÃ¦. Thou art my son, Whatever I may be; nor e'er canst thou, Without being impious, strive against thy father ... Bru. My name is Brutus; and to me is Rome A sublime mother! Ah, compel me not To deem that Roman Brutus, who gave life And liberty to Rome at the expense Of his own children's blood, my only father. SCENE THE THIRD. CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦. Ah, wretched me! ... And can it then be true, That, while I fetter all the conquer'd world, My son alone refuses to obey me?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Cassius, Cimber. Cim. That which I say to thee is certain: hence A short time since Brutus was seen to go, With troubled countenance, his eyes suffused With tears, and towards his house he went. Oh could He ever change? ... Cas. Ah no! Brutus loves Rome; And he loves glory and integrity; Soon, as he promised, will he come to us. I do rely and trust in him e'en more Than in myself. Each word and deed of his Spring from a lofty heart; the interest Of Rome alone he weighs and contemplates. Cim. Behold him here. Cas. Did not I tell thee so? SCENE THE SECOND. Brutus, Cassius, Cimber. Bru. What may this mean? I find you here alone. Cas. And are we few, when thou'rt united to us? Bru. Tully is wanting ... Cim. Didst thou not know this? Erewhile with many other senators From Rome precipitately he departed. Cas. The frost of years hath paralized in him His pristine ardour and his virtue ... Bru. But Hath not extinguish'd them. Ah, let no Roman Dare to despise the illustrious Cicero. For a more fortunate conjuncture, or For Rome's advantage, he reserves (I swear it) His liberty and life. Cas. Oh happy we! Certain are we, certain to gain, with freedom, An honour'd and an honourable age, Or in the bloom of life with Rome to perish. Bru. Ah! yes; ye're blest indeed! ... Not so am I; To whom the horrible alternative Alone remains of living as a slave, Or perpetrating crimes abhorr'd by nature. Cas. What dost thou mean? Cim. And what hast thou derived From thy long conference with CÃ¦sar? Bru. I? ... Nothing for Rome; immeasurable grief And horror for myself; for you amazement, Mix'd perchance also with a just contempt. Cim. For whom? Bru. For Brutus. Cim. We, ... contempt ... for thee? Cas. Thou, ... who of us art, and of Rome, the soul? Bru. I am, ... who would have thought it? Wretched me! ... I hitherto esteem'd myself the nephew And son-in-law of Cato the divine; ... And I'm the offspring of the tyrant CÃ¦sar. Cim. What do I hear? Can it be so? ... Cas. And be it; This hinders not that Brutus still should be The tyrant's most inexorable foe: Ah! Cassius swears this. Bru. An unexpected And horrible stigma on my blood I find; To cleanse it I should shed it all for Rome. Cas. Brutus should be alone the son of Brutus. Cim. But yet, what evidence did CÃ¦sar bring? How on his word rely? ... Bru. Ah, evidence But too decisive he adduced to me. He from the first spoke to me as a father: Henceforth he wish'd that I should share with him His execrable power, and afterwards Should be its infamous inheritor. Yet human tears from his despotic eyes Ceased not to fall; and he to me unfolded, As to a son, the darkest labyrinths, Unblushingly, of his corrupted heart. At length, to make me perfectly convinced, He made me read (oh heaven!) a fatal letter. With her own hand, Servilia wrote it to him. In that disastrous letter, which was written And read by him ere the Pharsalian trumpet âGave dreadful note of preparation,â Servilia apprehensively reveals And proves, that I'm the offspring of their loves; And in concise and energetic words, She conjures CÃ¦sar not to make himself The murderer of his son. Cim. Oh fatal secret! Why didst thou not in everlasting night Remain conceal'd? ... Cas. If as a son he loves thee, In seeing in thee so much real virtue, In hearing thy sublime awakening thoughts, How could the spirit of a genuine father Ever resist thee? Thou hast now brought back Indubitable proof from him, that nothing Can rescue CÃ¦sar from his vile delusion. Bru. Sometimes e'en yet to his infatuate mind Truth penetrates, but with a feeble ray. Accustom'd long to military power, A fatal error absolutely rules him; He deems consummate power consummate glory; He thence persists to wish for this or death. Cim. And such a monster, let him then have death. Cas. He is a fix'd incorrigible tyrant. Think now then that a citizen of Rome, Oh Brutus, has no father ... Cim. Further think, That he who is a tyrant has no sons ... Bru. And that in heart Brutus will ne'er have peace.â Yes, in your presence now, high-minded friends, This I confess; to you, who feel at heart Nature's affections sacred and sublime; To you, who take the impulse and the law That prompt this lofty necessary deed, Which we are now resolved to execute, From nature take it; to you, who now pant, With me, for ever to annihilate That tyranny which severs and divides And blasts each holiest tie, to make alone Children secure within their father's bosoms; To you I fear not to shew all the grief And all the horror, which, in rivalry, Little by little, tear my heart to pieces, Who am the son of CÃ¦sar and of Rome. Before the tyrant's face I shew'd myself His bitter and inexorable foe; Nor did a word of mine, a look, a tear, Betray a human weakness: but, alas! No sooner had I from his sight escaped, Than, as a victim, by a thousand furies My spirit was beset. I flew from him To my own Lares: there it is my lot Always to find a sure alleviation And fortifying counsel, and a heart Far more sublime than mine: yes, Cato's daughter, Equal to Cato, the illustrious Porcia, My Lares dignifies, the wife of Brutus ... Cas. Worthy of Cato and of Brutus is That high-soul'd lady. Cim. Ah! could this be also Said of Servilia! Bru. Troubled as I was, She welcomed me with countenance serene And resolute, though now for many days She had lain sick. Before I spake to her, She cried to me, âBrutus, thou hast conceal'd âLong in thy bosom mighty purposes: âI never dared to question thee of them, âTill by a certain but ferocious test âI had myself my courage fully known. âSee; I am not a woman.ââSaying this, She lets the foldings of her mantle fall, And shews to me a large and horrible wound Beneath her breast. Then she continued thus: âWith this right hand, and with this very dagger, âNow many days since, this wide wound was made: âIt has been evermore conceal'd from thee, âAnd by my heart inflexibly supported, âAlthough my infirm frame in sickness languish'd; âAt length this wound, if I am not deceived, âRenders me worthy both to hear and keep âThe secrets of my Brutus.â Cim. What a woman! Cas. What man can be compared to her? Bru. I fell Prostrate before her, at a sight like this, As to my sublime tutelary genius; And weeping, motionless, astonish'd, mute, I stood. Thence, reassuming speech, I told her All the ferocious conflicts of my heart. Seeing me weep, she wept; but her tears were Roman, not feminine. She blamed alone The adverse fates; and giving me perhaps The last embrace, she dared remind me yet That I'm a son of Rome, and Porcia's husband, And that my name is Brutus.âNever, never, Not for an instant, have I given such names T'oblivion: and I come to swear this to you. I only purposed to communicate To you the least part of my horrible state; And what I hitherto have said is merely The anguish that throbs audibly to friends. Now I'm aware I should convince you first, That even nature cannot make me swerve From Rome ... But grief, unutterable grief, Will take me afterwards too certainly From the possession of myself for ever. Cim. 'Tis true that we are Romans; but we are Men also; not in any wise to feel The affections of our nature, were in us Proofs of a brute ferocity ... Oh Brutus! ... By thy words e'en from me are tears extorted. Cas. All human impulses we ought to feel; But before those due to our bleeding country, Sick and exanimate, the rest are mute: Or if they speak indeed, it is allowed To every man ere Brutus to regard them. Bru. In thus accounting me more than I am, Noble and strong, thou makest me more strong And noble than I could be by myself. Cassius, behold my tears are now dispersed. The shades of night are gathering fast: to-morrow Will be the important day. I swear once more, That which already is resolved among us. On you do I implicitly depend; Depend on me: nothing of you I ask, Except that you depend upon the signal From me alone. Cas. Ah! thou art certainly The noblest of the Romans.âBut, who comes? ... Cim. Whom see I? Anthony? Bru. Assuredly CÃ¦sar now sends him to me. Wait, and hear us. SCENE THE THIRD. Anthony, Cassius, Brutus, Cimber. An. Oh Brutus, I come here in quest of thee; I wish to speak with thee. Bru. Speak on: I listen. An. But the dictator charged me with this message ... Bru. And what of that, I pray thee? An. I should speak To thee alone. Bru. And here I am alone. Cassius is husband of my sister Junia; Cimber was friend, and the most faithful friend, Of the great Cato, my wife's father: blood, The love of Rome, and friendship, render us, Though three we be in person, one in soul. CÃ¦sar can never utter aught to Brutus, That he re-utters not immediately To Cassius and to Cimber. An. Is their father Also the same with thine? Bru. They too have shared With me the shame and sorrow of my birth; They know it all. Speak on.âI am assured That CÃ¦sar, generous, once again himself, Sends thee to take from me the past disgrace Of having once been deem'd a tyrant's son. Divulge the whole, be quick: thou can'st not have More acceptable witnesses than these Of CÃ¦sar's sublime transit, from a tyrant, As he was lately, to a citizen. Make haste; his new-born lofty love for Rome Reveal to us; his true paternal views Towards me, that I may bless the day in which He gave me birth. An. CÃ¦sar commanded me To speak to thee alone. A blind and true, As much as wretched father, he would yet Flatter himself, that thou would'st yield at last To nature's sacred and persuasive voice. Bru. And in what fashion am I then to yield? To what submit myself? ... An. To love and honour The author of thy life: or if, perchance, Thy hard heart is incapable of love, Not to betray thy most imperious duties; To shew thyself not mindless and unworthy Of benefits received; and finally To merit those which he reserves for thee In future. Fear'st thou to be too humane If thou submit to this? Bru. Those which thou now Giv'st artfully to me are empty words. Advance, and answer me. Is CÃ¦sar ready To-morrow, in full senate, to renounce The office of dictator? Is he ready His standing army to disband? To free The Romans from their universal terror? To free his friends and enemies from this, And finally himself? To restore life To the most sacred laws by him despised, The enervated, obliterated laws? To be the first to place himself beneath them? These are the express, only benefits, That a true father can confer on Brutus. An. Enough. Would'st thou say more to me? Bru. I say No more to him that merits not to hear me.â Return then to thy lord, and say to him, That yet I hope, nay, more, I trust, am certain, That in the senate by to-morrow's dawn, He will propose useful and lofty things For Rome's prosperity and liberty: Tell him, that then, before assembled Rome, Brutus will first fall prostrate at his feet, As citizen and son; if he too be A citizen and father. Lastly, tell him, That in my heart I burn as much to make Rome live again for all of us, as I Burn to make CÃ¦sar live again for her ... An. I understand thee. I will tell him that Which I (too fruitlessly, alas!) already Long since have said to him. Bru. I esteem thee, A faithless and malignant messenger 'Twixt CÃ¦sar and myself: nevertheless, If he for this selected thee, thou hast Thy answer now received. An. If the dictator Consulted me, or the interests of Rome, No other messenger would he dispatch To Brutus but the lictors with their axes. SCENE THE FOURTH. Brutus, Cassius, Cimber. Cim. Heard ye ... Cas. Oh Brutus! ... Thou'rt the God of Rome. Cim. This arrogant and despicable slave, He also should be punish'd ... Bru. He, methinks, Would not be worthy our revenge. My friends, I make the last experiment to-morrow. If it be vain, we mutually have promised That I should give, and you obey the signal. Will ye confide in me? Cas. Thou art our all. Let us depart from hence: it is now time To go hence to the few whom we have chosen; And who are ready for the sake of Rome To die with us to-morrow. Bru. Let us go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. The Scene is in the Basilica of Pompey. SCENE THE FIRST. Brutus, Cassius, Senators, who in succession take their Places. Cas. It seems to me this meeting will be small; Much smaller than the last ... Bru. Provided that The hearts of the remainder be but firm, 'Tis all we want. Cas. Dost thou, oh Brutus, hear How the unquiet people with their cries Already make the deafening air resound? Bru. Their cries they vary at each new event: Leave them; e'en they perchance to-day may help us. Cas. I never saw thee calm as thou art now, And so secure. Bru. The danger spreads. Cas. Oh Brutus! ... Brutus, I yield to thee alone. Bru. Great Pompey, Who breathes in sculptured marble here, and seems Now to preside o'er few partizans, Makes me secure as to th'approaching danger. Cas. Behold, the lictors of the tyrant coming. Bru. Casca and Cimber, where? Cas. Fiercely they have Forestall'd by violence the post of danger ... They closely follow CÃ¦sar. Bru. Hast thou thought To hinder, that the impious Anthony? ... Cas. Yes: Fulvius and Macrinus will at length Keep him at bay at distance from the senate; If it be also needful t'intercept him, This will they do by force. Bru. Now all is well. Let each one take his placeâCassius, farewell. We from each other separate as slaves; Soon, as free men, I hope, we shall embrace, Or dying.âFirst shalt thou be witness here To the last efforts of a son; and then To the last efforts of a citizen. Cas. Each weapon on thy nod depends, oh Brutus! SCENE THE SECOND. Senators seated. Brutus and Cassius in their places. CÃ¦sar, preceded by Lictors, which afterwards leave him; Casca, Cimber, and many others, follow him. All rise at the entrance of CÃ¦sar, and continue standing till he be seated. CÃ¦. What can this mean? Scarce half the senate here, Although th'appointed hour be past. ... But I Beyond my duty have in this transgress'd.â Ye conscript fathers, I lament that thus I have detain'd you ... But yet, what can be The cause that takes from me so many of you? (UNIVERSAL SILENCE) Bru. Does no one answer? The demanded cause Is known to all of us. Is it not, CÃ¦sar, Fully divulged to thee by this our silence But, would'st thou hear it? Those whom thou seest here, Terror collected; those whom thou seest not, Terror dispersed. CÃ¦. I am not unaccustom'd To the intemperate harangues of Brutus, As to the generous clemency of CÃ¦sar Thou art not unaccustom'd. But in vain; For here I came not to dispute ... Bru. Nor we To offend thee idly. Certainly those fathers Were ill-advised who vanish'd from the senate On such a joyful day: and ill act those Who in the senate now stand mute. Myself, Fully apprized of the high sentiments Which CÃ¦sar purposes t'unfold to us, Can scarce restrain th'expression of my joy; Feeling the eager wish to dissipate The false alarm of others. Ah! no, now CÃ¦sar doth not within his bosom cherish Against his country any guilty purpose; Ah no! that generous clemency of his, With which to-day he has upbraided Brutus, And which in future he ought not to exert Towards me, to trembling and afflicted Rome He hath directed all of it already. To-day, I swear to you, that CÃ¦sar adds A new one, and the most sublime of all, To his so many triumphs; thence he here Presents himself the victor of himself, And of the envy of his adversaries. Yes, noble fathers, this I swear to you; CÃ¦sar to-day assembles you to this His sublime triumph: he has now resolved To recreate himself th'associate, The equal of his fellow-citizens; This would he do spontaneously; and hence 'Mid all the men that have been in the world, There never was, nor will be, CÃ¦sar's equal. CÃ¦. I might, oh Brutus, interrupt thy speech ... Bru. Nor let mine seem to you rash arrogance, Scarcely a prÃ¦tor that I should presume To anticipate the words of the dictator, For Brutus now and the illustrious CÃ¦sar Are but one person.âI behold your brows Arch'd with amazement: to the senators My language is obscure; but speedily, I shall make all clear with a single word. I am the son of CÃ¦sar ... (AN UNIVERSAL CRY OF ASTONISHMENT.) Bru. Yes; I am born from him; now do I thence Light exultation feel; since to-day CÃ¦sar Becomes, from a perpetual dictator, A first-rate, and perpetual citizen. (AN UNIVERSAL CRY OF JOY.) CÃ¦. ... Yes, Brutus is my son; I myself told Erewhile to him this secret. Th'energy, The eloquence, the impetuosity, I know not what of superhuman power That breathes in his discourse, made on my heart A deep impression: ardent, and aspiring, My genuine son, is Brutus. Hence, oh Romans, I chuse him, far more worthy than myself, To perform for you after me that service, Which now no longer lies within my power: I have decided to transfer to him My whole authority; in him have I Establish'd it: in him will ye have CÃ¦sar ... Bru. I stand secure: not Brutus' enemies The most embitter'd and implacable, Much more his friends, then, never will believe him Of this e'er capable; ah no!âTo me, CÃ¦sar, oh Romans, yields his power: he would Imply by this, that CÃ¦sar abdicates, At the entreaties of myself his son, His unjust power, that he replaces Rome In liberty for ever. (AN UNIVERSAL CRY OF JOY.) CÃ¦. 'Tis enough.â Thou as my son, and younger than myself, Shouldest keep silence in my presence.âNow, CÃ¦sar, oh fathers, speaksâI have resolved Irrevocably in my secret thoughts To go against the Parthians. To-morrow I march against Asia with my faithful legions: There have I long been summon'd, and by force Constrain'd to go, by th'unavenged shade Of Crassus. Rome I leave to Anthony; In him let her behold a second CÃ¦sar: Let Cimber, Casca, Cassius now return To their allotted prefectures: my side Brutus shall never quit. When I have slain The enemies of Rome, I will return And to my enemies submit myself: Then, at her will, whichever she likes best, Rome shall possess me as her citizen, As her dictator, or discard me quite. (UNIVERSAL SILENCE.) Bru. âThese were not certainly, which we have heard, The accents of a Roman, of my father, Nor e'en of CÃ¦sar. These were the harsh words Of a despotic king.âAh! father, yet Hear me once more; behold my tears, and hear Th'entreaties of a son and citizen Now all Rome by my mouth addresses thee. Behold that Brutus, whom no man e'er saw Hitherto weep or supplicate; behold him Prostrate before thee. Would'st thou be to me, And not to Rome, a father? CÃ¦. I will not Listen to prayers which are a public insult. Arise: be mute.âHe dares to call me tyrant; But I am not one: if I were, had I Myself permitted him to offer me Such gross indignities before all Rome?â What the dictator in his mind hath fix'd, Should all be executed. Thus commands The interest of Rome; and every man Who doubts now, or refuses to obey me, Is th'enemy of Rome; hostile to her, He is an impious traitor. Bru. Then let all Of us now, as true citizens should do, Obey the dictator. Brutus unsheathes his dagger, and brandishes it aloft; the conspirators dart towards CÃ¦sar with their swords. Cim. Die, tyrant, die! Cas. And may I smite him also! CÃ¦. Traitors ... Bru. Ah! And must I be the only one to spare him? ... Some Senators. Die, let the tyrant die! Other Senators , flying. Oh day of horrors! CÃ¦. Oppressed with wounds, dragging himself to the statue of Pompey, and having covered his face with his robe, he dies.Son, ... and thou too! ... I die ... Bru. Oh Rome! ... Oh father! ... Cim. But at the cries of the pale fugitives, The people flock already in a crowd ... Cas. Let them come in; the tyrant is no more. Let us now hasten to slay Anthony. SCENE THE THIRD. People, Brutus, CÃ¦sar dead. People. What has now happen'd? What cries did we hear? What blood is this? Ah Brutus yonder stands Immoveable with his uplifted dagger! Bru. People of Mars, (if yet ye are so) thither, Now thither turn your looks. Behold who lies At mighty Pompey's feet ... People. CÃ¦sar! Oh sight! ... He in his blood immersed! ... oh rage! Bru. Yes, CÃ¦sar Lies in his blood immersed: and I, though ye See in my hand a blade not stain'd with blood, I too, with others, I too slaughter'd CÃ¦sar ... People. Ah traitor! thou shalt die ... Bru. Already, see, The weapon's point is turn'd towards my breast. I mean to die: but listen to me first. People. Let those be murder'd first who transfix'd CÃ¦sar ... Bru. Ye seek in vain for other murderers: Dispersed amid the fluctuating crowd The assassins have already disappear'd. Save Brutus, 'tis in vain for ye to seek Another murderer. If ye are impell'd By fury here, thirsting t'avenge the death Of the dictator, let the life of Brutus Now pacify your vengeance.âBut, if yet The name of true and sacred liberty Reverberates in your hearts, and in your souls, Open your breasts t'unutterable joy: There he lies dead, there he lies dead at last, The king of Rome. People. What is it that thou sayest? Bru. The king of Rome, yes, I confirm it to you, And swear that he was such: he was a king: Such he spoke here; and such he shew'd himself, During the Lupercalia, to yourselves, That day, when he feigning the guilty crown Was his abhorrence, three times made the hand Of Anthony refit it on his head. The infamous collusion pleased you not; And he became convinced by certain proof, That, save by force, he ne'er would be a king. Hence, he would now have left Rome for the camp, Planning new wars, while she is quite exhausted Of men and arms and treasures; certain hence By dint of arms here to return a king, And make you with harsh penalties repent The interdicted crown. Gold, flatteries, games, Banquets, and spectacles, he lavish'd on you, To make you slaves: but th'impious attempt Was ineffectual; Romans, ye sell not Your liberty; and yet I see you all Ready to die for it: and I am also, I, yes, as much as you. Rome now is free; Brutus would now die satisfied. Be quick; And sacrifice him who restores to you Life, liberty, and virtue; yes, do ye Sacrifice Brutus to avenge your king. Behold my breast defenceless ... let him kill me Who still would be a slave. But he ought now Who will not murder me, to follow me, And terminate the enterprize by force. People. What words are these? A god inspires him. Bru. Ah! I see the former parasites of CÃ¦sar Become by little and by little Romans. Now hear if Brutus also be a Romanâ Are there among you who have hitherto E'en ever dreamt of that which I am now About to tell you with a solemn oath.â The tyrant CÃ¦sar was my real father. People. Oh heaven! What is it that thou tellest us? ... Bru. I am the son of CÃ¦sar; this I swear; He himself yesterday reveal'd to me The secret, and I swear to you, he wish'd To leave me, pledge of his paternal love, As if it were his proper heritage, Tranquil and undisputed, wish'd one day To leave me, his authority in Rome. People. Oh vile audacity ... Bru. And thence he dared Discover all his guilty views to me ... People. Then (ah too certainly!) he did design At length to shew himself a thorough tyrant ... Bru. I, as a son, wept, and entreated him; And lastly, as a citizen, conjured him T'abandon th'infamous design: ah! what Did I not do, to change him from a king? ... I e'en entreated from him as a gift Death; which from his hands I should more have prized Than all his surreptitious royalty: But all in vain: in his tyrannical breast He had resolved to reign, or die. I then The signal gave to kill him; I gave it Myself to a firm few: meanwhile on high I raised my trembling and suspended arm. People. Oh pristine virtue! oh true Brutus! Bru. Yes; The king of Rome is slain; for this should we Pay homage to the gods: but yet has Brutus Slain his own father; ... and he merits death From you. And think ye I would live? ... I ought For a few instants still, while I exert Myself with you to give security To Rome's regenerated commonwealth: The lofty duties yet must be fulfill'd Of citizen, and of deliverer; For these alone Brutus consents to live: But a high obligation also dooms The impious and parricidal son Of the great CÃ¦sar t'immolate himself, With his own hands, upon his father's tomb. People. Oh dire event! ... Amazement, terror, pity; ... Oh, what a multitude of impulses Have we at once experienced! ... But ... oh sight! E'en in the midst of rage, Brutus himself Also dissolves in tears ... Bru. âI weep, oh Romans; I weep for CÃ¦sar dead. Sublime endowments Not to be equall'd in the world; a soul, Which never had its counterpart, had CÃ¦sar: Base is that heart which weeps not for him dead.â But, who dare now again to wish him living Is not a Roman. People. Thine are words of fire, Oh Brutus ... Bru. May yours then be deeds of fire; The deed is lofty; worthy of ourselves; Follow my steps; and let us now restore Full and eternal liberty to Rome. People. For Rome, ah! yes, following thy steps we're ready For all; for any thing ... Bru. Make speed then, now Let us go quickly to the Capitol; This is the seat sacred to liberty: Would ye now leave it in the hands of traitors? People. Let us depart: and wrest from traitors' hands The sacred citadel. Bru. To death, to death Or freedom let us go! Brutus moves forward, fiercely brandishing his sword; the people all follow him with fury. People. To death, to death With Brutus, or to freedom we depart. Farewell. Judgment suggests to me that I should here Release my feet from the Italian buskin, (If it indeed e'er graced them) and that I Should to myself swear never to resume it. 1787.
