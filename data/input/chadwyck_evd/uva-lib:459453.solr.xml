      <field name="fulltext">THE MASQUE OF AUGURES WITH THE SEVERALL ANTIMASQVES PRESENTED ON TWELFE-NIGHT, 1622.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Antimasque had for the Scene The Court Buttry-hatch. The Presenters were from St. Katharines, Notch a Brewers Clarke, Slug a Lighterman, Van-goose a rare Artist; Lady Alewife her two Women, three dancing Beares, Urson the Bear-ward, Groome of the Revells. Notch. Come, now my head's in, Ile even venture the whole: I ha seene the Lyons ere now, and he that hath seene them may see the King. Slvg. I thinke he may; but have a care you go not too high (neighbour Notch) least you chance to have a Tally made of your pate, and bee clawed with a cudgell; there is as much danger going too neere the King, as the Lyons. Groom. Whither? whither now gamesters? what is the businesse? the affaire? stop I beseech you. Not. This must be an Officer, or nothing, he is so peart and breife in his demands! a pretty man! and a pretty man is a little o'this side nothing; howsoever we must not be daunted now, I am sure I am a greater man than he out of the Court, and I have lost nothing of my Sire since I came to it. Groom. Hey-da! what's this? A hogshead of beere broake out of the Kings buttery, ro some Dutch Hulke! whether are you bound? The winde is against you, you must backe; doe you know where you are? Not. Yes sir, if we bee not mistaken, we are at the Court, and would be glad to speake with something of lesse authority, and more wit, that knowes a little in the place. Gro. Sir, I know as little as any man in the place; speake, what is your businesse? I am an Officer, Groome of the Revels, that is my place. Not. To fetch Bonge of Court a parcell of invisible bread, and beere for the Plaiers (for they never see it) or to mistake sixe Torches from the Chandry, and give them one. Gro. How sir? Not. Come, this is not the first time you have carried coales to your owne house, I meane that should have warm'd them. Groom. Sir, I may doe it by my place, and I must question you farther. Not. Be not so musty sir, our desire is only to know whether the Kings Majesty, and the Court expect any disguise here to night. Gro. Disguise! what meane you by that? doe you thinke that his Majesty sits here to expect drunkards? Not. No, if hee did, I beleeve you would supply that place better then you do this: Disguise was the old English word for a Masque sir, before you were an implement belonging to the Revels. Gr. There is no such word in the Office now I assure you sir, I have serv'd here, man, and boy a Prentiship or twaine, and I should know. But, by what name so ever you call it, here will be a Masque, and shall be a Masque, when you and the rest of your Comrogues shall sit disguis'd in the stocks. Notch. Sure by your language you were never meant for a Courtier, howsoever it hath beene your ill fortune to be taken out of the nest young; you are some Constables egge, some such Widgin of Authoritie, you are so easily offended! Our comming was to shew our loves sir, and to make a little merry with his Majesty to night, and we have brought a Masque with us, if his Majestie had not beene better provided. Groome. Who you? you a Masque? why you stincke like so many bloat-herrings newly taken out of the chimney! In the name of Ignorance, whence came you? or what are you? you have beene hang'd in the smoake sufficiently, that is smelt out alreadie. Notch. Sir, we doe come from among the Brewhouses in Saint Katherines, that's true, there you have smoak'd us (the Docke comfort your nosthrills,) and we may have lived in a mist there, and so mist our purpose; but for mine owne part I have brought my properties with me to expresse what I am; the keyes of my calling hang here at my girdle, and this the Register booke of my function shewes mee no lesse then a Clarke at all points, and a Brewers Clarke, and a Brewers head Clarke. Gro. A man of accompt sir! I cry you mercie. Slvg. I sir, I knew him a fine Merchant, a merchant of Hops, till all hopt into the water. Notch. No more of that, what I have beene, I have beene; what I am, I am: I Peter Notch, Clarke, hearing the Christmas invention was drawne drie at Court; and that neither the Kings Poet, nor his Architect had wherewithall left to entertaine so much as a Baboone of quality, nor scarce the Welsh Embassadour if hee should come there: Out of my allegiance, to wit, drew in some other friends that have as it were presumed out of their own naturalls, to fill up the vacuum with some pretty presentation, which we have addressed, and conveighed hither in a Lighter at the generall charge, and landed at the backe doore of the Buttery, through my neighbour Slug's credit there. Slvg. A poore Lighter-man sir, one that hath had the honour sometimes to lay in the Kings beere there; and I assure you I heard it in no worse place then the very Buttry, for a certaine, there would bee no Masque, and from such as could command a jacke of beere, two, or three. Van. Dat is all true, exceeding true, de inventors be barren, lost, two, dre, vour mile, I know that from my selven; dey have no ting, no ting vau deir owne, but dat dey take vrom de eard, or de zea, or de heaven, or de hell, or de rest van de veir Clementen, de place a, dat be so common as de vench in de Burdello. Now me would bring in some dainty new ting, dat never was, nor never fall be in de rebus natura; dat has never van de materia, nor de forma, nor de hoffen, nor de voote, but a mera devisa of de braine— Groom. Hey-da! what Hans Flutterkin is this? what Dutchman doe's build or frame Castles in the Aire? Not. He is no Dutch man sir, he is a Brittaine borne, but hath learn'd to misuse his owne tongue in travell, and now speakes all languages in ill English; a rare Artist he is sir, and a Projector of Masques. His Project in ours is, that we should all come from the three dancing Beares in Saint Katherines (you may hap know it sir) hard by where the Priest fell in, which Alehouse is kept by a distressed Lady; whose name (for the honour of Knighthood) will not bee knowne; yet she is come in person here Errant, to fill up the adventure with her two women that draw drinke under her, Gentlewomen borne all three, I assure you. Slvg. And were three of those Gentlewomen that should have acted in that famous matter of Englands joy in sixe hundred and three. Lady. What talke you of England's joy, Gentlemen? you have another matter in hand I wis, Englands sport and delight if you can manage it. The poore Cattle yonder are passing away the time, with a cheat loafe, and a bumbard of broken beere, how will ye dispose of them? Gro. Cattle! what cattle doe's she meane? Lady. No worse then the Kings game I assure you; The Beares, Beares both of qualitie and fashion, right Beares, true Beares. Not. A devise only to expresse the place from whence we come (my Ladies house) for which we have borrowed three very Beares that (as her Ladyship aforesayd sayes) are well bred, and can dance to present the signe, and the Beareward to stand for the signe-poast. Gro. That is prettie; but are you sure you have sufficient Beares for the purpose. Slvg. Very sufficient Beares as any are in the Ground, the Parish-Garden, and can dance at first sight, and play their owne tunes if need bee. Iohn Vrson the Beare-ward, offers to play them with any Citie-dancers christned, for a ground measure. Not. Marry, for lofty tricks, or dancing on the Ropes hee will not undertake, it is out of their element he sayes. Sir, all our request is since we are come, we may be admitted, if not for a Masque, for an Antickmaske, and as we shall deserve therein, we desire to be returned with credit to the Buttry from whence we came, for reward, or to the Porters Lodge with discredit, for our punishment. Gro. To be whipt with your Beares? Well, I could bee willing to venture a good word in behalfe of the Game, if I were assured the aforesayd game would be cleanly, and not fright the Ladies. Not. For that sir, the Bear-ward hath put in securitie, by warranting my Ladie and her Women to dance the whole changes with them in safety; and for their abusing the place you shall not need to feare, for he hath given them a kinde of Dyet-bread to binde them to their good behaviour. Gro. Well, let them come; if you need one, Ile helpe you my selfe. Enter John Urson with his Beares singing. Ballad. Though it may seeme rude For me to intrude, With these my Beares by chance-a; 'Twere sport for a King, If they could sing As well as they can dance-a Then to put you out Of feare or doubt, We came from St. Katharin-a; These dancing three, By the helpe of mee, Who am the Post of the signe-a We sell good ware, And we need not care Though Court, and Country knew it. Our Ale's o' the best, And each good guest Prayes for their souls that brew it. For any Ale-house, We care not a lowse, Nor Taverne in all the Towne-a; Nor the Vintry Cranes, Nor St. Clements Danes, Nor the Devill can put us down-a, Who has once there beene, Comes thither agen, The liquour is so mighty; Beere strong and stale, And so is our Ale, And it burnes like Aquavitæ. To a stranger there, If any appeare, Where never before he has bin; We shew th'yron Gate, The wheele of St. Kate, And the place where the Priest fel in. The Wives of Wapping They trudge to our tapping, And still our Ale desire; And there sit and drinke, Till the spue, and stinke, And often pisse out our fire. From morning to night, And about to day-light, They sit and never grudge it; Till the Fish-wives joyne Their single coyne, And the Tinker pawnes his budget. If their braines be not well, Or their bladders doe swell, To ease them of their burden; My Ladie will come With a bowle and a broome, And her Hand-mayd with a Iorden. From Court we invite Lord, Ladie, and knight; Squire, gentlman, yeoman and groom. And all our stiffe drinkers, Smiths, Porters, and Tinkers, And the beggars shall give ye roome. Van. How like you? how like you? Gro. Excellent! The Beares have done learnedly, and sweetly. Van. Tis noting, tis noting; vill you see someting? Ick sall bring in de Turkichen, met all zin Bashawes, and zin dirty towsand Yanitsaries met all zin Whooren, Cunuken, all met an auder, de Sofie van Persia, de Tartar Cham met de groat King of Mogull, and make deir men, and deir horse, and deir Elephanten be scene fight in de ayre, and be all killen, and aliven, and no such ting. And all dis met de Ars van de Catropricks, by de reflesbie van de glassen. Not. Oh, he is an admirable Artist. Slvg. And a halfe sir. Gro. But where will he place his glasses? Van. Fow, dat is all ean, as it be two, dree, veir, vise tousand Mile off: Ick sall multipliren de vizioun, met an ander secret dat Ick heb: Spreck, vat vil you haben? Gro. Good sir put him toot, bid him doe something that is impossible; he will undertake it I warrant you. Not. I doe not like the Mogul, nor the great Turke, nor the Tartar, their names are somewhat to big for the Roome; marry if he could shew us some Countrey Plaiers, strolling about in severall Shires, without licence from the Office, that would please I know whom, or some Welsh Pilgrims. Van. Pilgrim? now yow talke of de Pilgrim, if come in my head, Ick vill shew yow all de whole brave Pilgrim o'de Uorld: de Pilgrim dat goe now, now at de instant, two, dre towsand Mile to de great Mahomet, at de Mecha, or here, dere, every where, make de fine Latyrints, and shew all de brave error in de vorld. Slvg. And shall we see it here? Nan. Yau, here, here, here in vis Roome, tis very Roome: vel vat is dat to yow if Ick doe de ting? vat an devill, vera boten devill? Gro. Nay, good sir be not angry. Not. 'Tis a disease that followes all excellent men, they cannot governe their passions; but let him alone, try him one 'bout. Gro. I would try him, but what has all this to doe with our Maske? Van. O Sir, all de better vor an Antick-maske, de more absurd it be, and vrom de purpose, it be ever all de better. If it goe from de nature of de ting, it is de more Art: for deare is Art, and deare is Nature, yow sall see. Hochos-pochos, Pancos, Palabros. The Second Antimaske.
