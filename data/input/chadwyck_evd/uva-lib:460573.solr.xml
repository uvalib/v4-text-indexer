      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SceneâAn Antichamber in Orlando's Castle. Enter Mark and Servants. Mark. What! will not he who weds my daughter see me? It cannot be that he hath trick'd me thus. Wedded!âye saints!âthe ceremony past!â Oh haste thee, Robert, haste thee to my Lordâ Kneeling I pray thee bring me to his presence. Nay if thou wilt not, I will call so loud That Magdeline herself shall come to fetch me. 1st Ser. Raise no disturbance now, good Mark: rest here. Though I gain anger for it, I'll in and strive To have fresh orders: for, in my opinion, 'Tis very sinful, reverend man, 'gainst thee This day to bar the Castle gates. 2d Serv. The day Orlando weds should sure be festive. Mark. But what if Magdeline be not content, Wilt thou keep festival while she doth sorrow? 2d Serv. Fair Magdeline! I'd fast the whole week thro' Did she but grieve, and I that grief could cure. But she is Fortune's fav'rite, justly so, And her rare qualities have met reward. Mark. She doth not think like thee. I have observ'd Her smiles, and they are feign'd; while very oft Nature and Truth break forth in heavy sighs. 2d Serv. That's very true: and I myself have thought That ever since this marriage was propos'd Her face hath ta'en a melancholy cast. Yet, can it be that she should not rejoice, When, though the child of thee and Beatrice, Poor cottagers and vassals of our Lord, She's rais'd to share his fortune and his honours? And though 'tis true he hath the start in years, Yet is he strong and healthful, seeming young. Mark. Go! there's a parity of mind that mingles The extreme of age and youth in bonds of love; And there's a dissonance of mind in man That the same hour of birth could never blend. My child is humble as her father's lot, Nor through ambition weds, and less through love. 2d Serv. Why then bestow her hand against her will? Mark. A mind less noble, William, less enlarg'd, Had past unhurt the shallows she hath struck. 'Twas Gratitude Orlando rais'd before her; Heaven's mark, remov'd upon a rocky shore, Which she but follows to her own destruction. My mind is ill at easeâI prithee leave meâ See if Orlando deigns to meet me here. (Exit Servant. Mark alone. A pious end by impious means pursued Can ne'er be well attain'd. The noble mind, Proposing to itself some noble end, Rejects with horror what can only spring From fountains so impure and so accurst As perfidy, deceit, or perjuryâ As perjury!âI shudder at the thoughtâ Perjury!âto invoke the Omniscient To look on falshood!âTo call down Heaven To witness vows, which some untoward act, Some worldly accident hath pow'r to break! Oh! 'tis a deed that shocks my soul to think on. Let me reflectâthere still are hopesâmy oath, That oath I swore 'fore Heaven to lost Lucretia; That fatal oath, so big with ruin now, If Heaven so will, may yet remain unbroken. The least the tyrant now can grant is time To speak in private with my confessor, And he shall guide me through this labyrinth. Enter Orlando. Orl. Give me thy hand: thou art my father now. Mark. Out, out upon'tâthy heart's corrupt, Orlando, Is rotten to the very core. Orl. How's this? Mark. Hast thou not broke thy faith? didst thou not promise, And in the awful face of Heaven declare, That for awhile thou would'st defer these nuptials? Orl. Why do I lose my time? I'll hear no moreâ But know, I was resolv'd to wed thy daughter. Thy stubborn and unruly spirit crost My bliss, that sought the honour of thy race. At length that stubborn spirit I have marr'd, And plac'd my joys beyond my Vassal's pow'r. Yet hast thou forc'd me to a crafty part. I told thy daughter that thou hadst consented; And, that my words might bear the seal of truth, I did confirm them with an artful letter, So well devis'd that even thou might'st doubt The writing to be thine, did not the substance Prove the reverse of thy rebellious will; A tale so suited to her tender heart, That gain'd at once her credit and consent. Mark. Feel'st thou no flushing of the cheek, Orlando? And doth thy tongue not stammer forth the avowal Of the base forgery? Orl. A pious fraud, To pass the bar of mad authority, Which thy parental obstinancy rais'd. I know my actions meet not thy applause: Nor should I wonder if, as sure I might, I had forc'd the Beauty to my longing arms, And sated thrown her to thy humble lot: But there's an awful charm in Magdeline Controuls licentiousness:âe'en I avow it. What would'st thou more than raise her humble state To title, wealth, and pleasure? Mark. These are mere sounds to humble ears like hersâ Hear me, my Lord! Pleasure is vague and hath no fixt criterion: Each diff'rent mind its diff'rent pleasure hath. The abandon'd man, who lies in wait for ruin, Makes guilt his pleasure: but there is a pleasure Permitted to Mortality conjoint With higher beings, e'en with the Highest; The great, the God-like joy of doing good! Orl. If thro' these veins luxuriant Nature sped Her genial glow with more than common sire, 'Tis Nature's deed. Am I the abandon'd man? Yes, onceâah poor Lucretia!âIs it not so? Mark. Who, my Lord, did aught mention of Lucretia? Conscience! Conscience! how prevalent art thou! Orl. I said I'd hear no more: yet I would fain, For Magdeline's dear sake, prevail with thee To give thy presence and concurring voice To our felicity.âAnger away! Come, turn and be Orlando's friend, his father. Thou know'st, while yet she smil'd in infancy, I rais'd her from the vale of poverty, Gave her the fairest shelter of my castle, Supplied the want of wealth to her and thee, And snatch'd her from the gulf of ignorance: Then give her to my arms, my lawful wife. Mark. Pardon, my Lord! you rais'd my daughter, true! But not from poverty: a costlier robe Mayhap she wears, and feeds on prouder banquets; But do not think that superfluity Can, by comparison, make competence Less competent; and he's ill-learn'd indeed, That deemeth poverty comparative: Poor is he that ragged goes, who not hath The wherewithal to satisfy plain Nature, And lacketh spirit to endure his poorness: But he that o'er his furnish'd limbs can spread Unbroken garments, who hath wholesome food, And above all possesses spirit pure To praise his God, compare him as thou wilt With lords or kings, thou can'st not call him poor. Orl. Excellent Philosopher!âExcellent! Mark. For ignorance, my Lord! I do deny That Magdeline had liv'd unknown of wisdom, E'en though she ne'er had pass'd a greater threshold Than the low threshold of her father's cottage. 'Tis true I'm born beneath thy dignity; But I was early notic'd by my Lord, Thy father, my lov'd, my lamented Lord; Who ope'd fair Learning's treasure to my mind: Nor was I sluggard to the noble boon. I could have taught my daughter: Could! Oh Heaven! Who but myself has sown her mind with virtues, And every knowledge that becomes her sex? And am I now refus'd, unhappy wretch! The solace of conferring with my child? Oh, my Lord! I'll call thee my dear, dear Lord! Crop not, untimely thus, my lovely flower:â Thus on my knees I beg thee to refrain. Orl. Rise, Mark! there's something moves thy troubled soul: But I will not be disappointed: look to't. Mark. What shall I do? indeed it must not be. Dost know, my Lord, but thy Lucretia lives? At least thou can'st not say that she is dead. Orl. Not dead! poor Lucretia! I lov'd thee once! That I did love her, witness my espousing, E'en after I had revell'd on her charms, That never sated: ill-fortun'd fair one! So obstinately bent to make atonement.â Now sixteen years are past since forth she went, Resolv'd upon her tender soles alone, To reach Jerusalem: full sixteen years; And of her fate no tidings have we had: We all have mourn'd her dead, nor e'er till now Hast even thou once doubted of her death. Mark. A daughter's honour and eternal welfare, Have pow'r to raise more groundless doubt than this. Orl. Now, Mark, it joys me much to find the cause Of thy repugnance, and to find it too Of weight so trivial, that thy own good sense Shall aid thee soon to throw it off. Enterâ My bride will wonder at so long an absence. Enterâbut at thy peril check my joys. (Going. Mark catching his Garmentâhe turns. Mark. The Devil hath rais'd a Fairy edifice Of happiness before thee, and through the door Presents a pleasing view: but, oh beware! 'Tis mock'ry and decoy. Orl. Thou turbulent! I'll have thee made secure. Mark. Yet one word more, Orlando! Oh my Lord! I leave thee for awhile, grant me but this, Grant it, my Lord! for thy soul's sake and mine; Forbear, till I return; nay swear thou wilt. Orl. And thou, with spirit of the Grecian Sage, Wilt fly thy native shore, an exile die, And give thy corpse a grave beneath the sea; Left here thy bones be brought to free my oath: Thine may the blood of a Lycurgus be, But then remember, Mark! that I'm no Spartan. Mark. I wrong'd thee not with such unapt suspicion.â Orlando! hear me Orlando! there is 'Tween thee and Magdeline a fiery bar, Blaz'd by the hand of Nature and of Heav'n; And no caprice of mad authority. I could remove the film that blinds thine eye; But, oh! I've sworn an awful oath to Heav'n.â Grant me a little time t' advise once more With Jeremy, my feeble soul's director. Orl. The day is waning fast, yet thou hast time: Then cast off age, and come with youthful speed. Mark. Wilt thou then give me time? bless thee! my Lord! Promise me, swear thou wilt. Orl. If thou return'st To night, I will: but then remember this, That no feign'd tale of Lucrece living still, Shall sway with me to quit my Magdeline. Mark. Thou wilt not again break faith! oh Lucretia! (Exit. Orlando alone. Lucretia! ay, he hath heard that she's aliveâ I know that she esteem'd him, muchâperhapsâ 'Tis so, and he is sworn to secrecy.â If he return commission'd to reveal, Away fly all my hopes of Magdeline.â But for this superstitious piety I now had known it, and had now been lost. Oh thanks to virtue for this obligation! Claudio!ânow this requires some artâho! Claudio! Enter Claudio. Orl. Haste to the Convent, boy, make quick dispatch, Send hither friar Jeremy; but heed Thou dost instruct him take the narrow path, That westward measures round the Castle wall. Be sure to keep him from the open road, For there would he meet Mark, gone hence to seek him, And that's thy errand to prevent.âAway! Claud. Most willingly I fly to serve my Lord. (Exit. Orlando alone. See! what a pother keeps this blood of ours! Subjecting man to its despotic sway, And drowning Reason as it pours along! Why, what a thing am I! borne headlong down The stream of Passion, with my own free will: Toss'd by the muddy current to and fro, Fretting and boiling through a fev'rish life, And ev'ry straw that meets me rubs me sore.â Who is this slave that tops me to my face, That I should calmly hear him mar my joy? Who sets me on to plot and to contrive? The sire of Magdeline, if he oppose The welfare of his child, is not her sire: To cherish and promote bespeak the parent.â But I will bear it still, and act with craft:â The man who would secure success, must find With Eagle eye each avenue that opens To disappointment; these well watch'd and barr'd, Wisdom may rest in full security. (Exit. Scene.âAn interior Apartment of the Castle. Enter Magdeline and Constance. Mag. Go, seek my Lord, and say we wait his presence. (Exit Constance. Magdeline alone. Why do I sigh? It is a foolish sorrowâ Teach me, my Father, to support my duty. (Takes out a letter and reads. âChild of my bosom! to whose grateful mind, And lovely virtues of the soul, I owe The dearest pleasures of my waning life; Continue still as good as thou art beauteous. How I have lov'd thee, lacks not testimony: That I still love thee, thou may'st well believe. Oh Magdeline! my joy, my comfort here! Join to repay thy Father's gratitude. Too long have we withstood Orlando's suit: A fresh and noble instance of his bounty Awakes our virtue, and demands return. My child! thy Father's little farm is sold, And his cot challeng'd o'er his dying head. The base Ejector of my humble roof Reposes on the count'nance of my Lord, Enrag'd that we refuse his great alliance. But nobly tow'ring o'er a mind so base, My Lord has giv'n me warning of the deed; His gen'rous purse is open to my wants, And he hath vouch'd my right in noble letters Sent to the Steward of the Court. Thy Mother, Thy aged Mother too, is call'd away. It is to save our little all we go, And scarcely shall we be in time to meet The saucy foe who summons us to answer. We can no longer our consent withhold, To make Orlando happy. Oh! reward him! Fly to his arms without delay, and make Oh! make our thanks substantial gratitude: In time we will return to bless you both.ââ These are his words. Ah! fatal words to me. Enter Orlando. Mag. My noble Lord, your friends propose to while The time in walking through the Forest grounds, And wait but your consent to join the band. Orl. It is my joy to yield me to thy wish: But what, my Magdeline, with so much haste, Dost thou conceal from thy Orlando's eye? Mag. My Father's letter, good my Lordâno moreâ Wherein with grateful words he well records Your noble bounty and beneficence. How little able to repay is he! Yet what he can, my Lord, he doth; and me, Though poor of value in my own account, He deems his treasure, and bestows it freely. Come, shall we join our friends? Orl. Go on, my love;â Triumphant Pleasure round thee plants his spell, And where thou lead'st Delight and Love attend. (Exeunt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene.âA Cottage in the Forest. Enter Beatrice and Martyn. Beatrice. Strangers! good Martyn, and come this way? They miss their road, unless they seek my Lord, or some of us. How were they clad? How seem'd they? Gentle, or of low demeanour? Mart. Good dame! I cannot say as to their words, for I took not on me to speak to them: but methought both their countenances betoken'd grief and weariness. I heard the woman sigh deeply as they past, but word they neither spake. She lean'd on his arm. Beat. How clad? aged or youthful? Mart. In truth I think they both are young; but the lad still greatly younger than the dame; for scarcely seem'd he fledg'd, yet mainly stout and manly, as though he were fit for the wars. Beat. In Heaven's good time I hope the wars are over. Cruel wars! where brothers fought 'gainst brothers, and sons against their sires. Too well I remember them. But bloody Richard hath been slain. All will now be peace. Thou hast not said how they were clad? Mart. I think she wears a Pilgrim's habit; for on the garment, well contriv'd in folds to suit her sex, the cockle shell is wrought at equal distances. In her hand she holds the Cross; and her hair hangs loosely on her neck. You change colour, good Beatrice, and tremble. Beat. Good Heaven! If this should be!â'Tis sixteen years since she was bornâThis is the hoping of a foolish old woman. And prithee, good Martyn, was the youth a Pilgrim likewise? Mart. He has upon his shoulders a wrapper of the same that girts his fair companion; but in his hat a jewel sparkles, and his large plumes wave proudly. He also hath a cross; but the staff is thick, and fitter for a warrior than peaceful Pilgrim: its lower end was iron pointed. Beat. Why did'st not speak to them? Thou should'st have ask'd what cheer, and whither bent? Did'st heed the woman's face? Mart. I did, and truly 'tis a comely one. Beat. Fair? Mart. Ay, but the Sun hath touch'd it. Beat. Tall or short? Mart. Tall, but bending as she lean'd on the young man's arm. Beat. It would be wonderful indeed! and the work of some good saint. Where, where is Mark? I must go seek him. Good even Martyn. Mart. Good even to thee, Beatrice! and God be with thee. (Exeunt severally. Scene.âThe Forest. Enter Edward and Lucretia. Edw. Oh! how enchanting is this scene! while here Treading this mountain side, beyond the vale Yon plumed wood, upon our neighbour hill, Appears in striking majesty array'd With Summer's thickest robe, in gentle curve Descending leftwards: while the Orb of day, Declining, skirts with gold the fleecy top, Seeming to rest upon th' enliven'd edge. See! how he darts his flame-abated glory, That with unpunish'd eye we now may view, Its ardent fulgence, cool'd to mortal organ By the intervening foliage. Below, How beautiful! how grateful to the sight Those pastures rich, still further to the left, Where graze the cattle and the fleecy tribe: And the fine inequalities and mounds The Sun, falling beyond the plumed mountain, Marks out, with varied light and shade delightful. My eye is charm'd, and chains me to the spot. That rustic building near, whose Eastern scite, Lofty and prominent, receives embrown'd The parting day, leads on to trace the landscape, And with delighted eye to pour along The distant country, as it spreads adorn'd With fainter woods, and lessening edifices, By Art upon the front of Nature set: Bounded afar with curving mountains blue Of undistinguishable wood: Serene, All glowing with the mild and evening tint. Nor less serene that yonder rising cloud Spreads his broad shade upon the distant scene. Ah! while I speak, beneath the dark-green wood The Sun is sunk; the rays refulgent gone. Oh! for a Painter's hand well skill'd in lore Of Nature, and romantic Art divine, To have caught the fleeting glory ere it fled, And staid it to this scene forever.âHow fair'st? Luc. (sighs). Ah me!âThese are Orlando's fair domains. My gentle youth! how many a mournful mile Hither have we travell'd, side by side! And thou hast help'd me much upon the way, For not alone my weary feet thy arm Hath eas'd, thy sweet discourse my sorrows. Edw. If sorrows end not here, they will above. Luc. Sure Heaven hath heard, and interceding Saints Have brought down mercy on this sinful head. Oh! I have sinn'd, but, Edward, well thou know'st I've also suffer'd much. Indeed I have. Edw. Still hold this arm. Luc. That arm! Is it not wearied? Is't not quite numb'd? Kind hath it been to me: But I've impos'd upon its strength enough, And will not now; for weary though I am, I have been wearier much. Edw. A little numb'd; But dropt it from its socket in thy service, I would not grieve. Dear Lady, use it still. Luc. Alas! I'm very weak: but rest awhile; Nor am I so fatigued to suffer Self To throw its load on such benevolence Edw. Do not thus mar the joy to me it gives. By Heaven I swear, the pain I so endure Brings me such pleasure I forget all pain. For since I met thee first beyond the Alps, Where blessed Saints convey'd me to thy aid, My heart hath been so bound to thee, There is no load I would not bear to serve thee. I would call thee Sister, make our blood akin, Together beat our path through the vain world, Discourse the weariness of time away, Pity the sorrows of this earthly life, And talk in raptures of Eternity. Luc. Dear youth! I love thee too, with such pure love. So brave, so good, so gentle, and so young! With what fair seeds have thy first years been sown! Thy father must have been a worthy man. Edw. As ever saw the light: pious and brave, Learned, charitable, belov'd of all; And for his love of meâOh! 'twas excessive! He was my greatest friend on earth. Alas! In battle slainâwould I had died that day! Young as I was he led me to the field, Close by his side I stood in hottest danger, We Volunteers with troops that fought the cause Of Naples' king against young Charles of France. Would he had staid at home! ah! fatal powder! Invention of the Devil!âmy father fellâ A mortal arm had strove in vain to throw himâ I rais'd him in my arms, and bore him speechless To his tent. Luc. Bless thee for the pious deed! Edw. There for awhile he was restor'd to life; His speech return'd, and ne'er shall I forget The last sad sounds he utter'd: my son, he said, And with a voice that chill'd my blood he spoke, Kiss this bright cross, and lay it to thy heart, Then swear that thou wilt punctually perform The last behest of thy fond father; swearâ So may Alonzo's curse or blessing speed thee!â Alonzo was my father's nameâI sworeâ Then from his bosom forth he drew a paper, And as the blood ran purpling from his wound, Into the precious stream immerg'd the charge: All-dripping with the life from which I sprung Beneath my vest, and next my heart, he plac'd it. Luc. Oh dreadful! Edw. Then the awful scene he clos'd With these mysterious wordsâTo Britain go, And when thou art arriv'd on Cornish land, But not before, there read, reflect, perform. Luc. Alas! Is Cornwall then the source of woe? Edw. Curse on the place whence'er thy sorrows spring! Luc. Oh! curse not place; but rather let thy curses Fall on the wicked, and their crimes. Edw. Thou can'st not be so sinful as thou say'st. No, Lucretia, I cannot think thee wicked, Truly wicked, but for some fancied crime By Superstition doom'd to this hard penance. Luc. I had a naughty heart. Ah Mortimer! Edw. And sure thy Mortimer is now appeas'd. To me indeed thou seemest all perfection. Luc. Then am not what I seem, but all corruption: A devil stalking on the earth. Edw. An angel, Dropt from heaven. Luc. A vile adultress that forsook the true And genial couch of wedded innocence. How wilt thou hate me, Edward, for my crimes! Edw. I scarce can credit e'en thy own avowal, For where could Pureness better dwell than there? I rather could believe thee made of ice. Luc. Oh! Mortimer! his name was Edward too. Edward! so was our first born likewise call'd. They went awayâ'Twas I that went away; 'Twas I that broke my husband's heart; 'twas I That kill'd my husband and my child: Oh Monster! Edw. These are indeed the darkest blots of life: But thou hast wash'd them well with saltest tears. Luc. Fond youth! thou know'st not half the pangs that prey Upon the heart of her thou fain would'st comfort: But comfort lies with Heaven. Perhaps my prayers, My sighs, my tears, have reach'd the throne of Grace. Edw. They have, they have; take comfort. Luc. Edward, I left my Mortimer for misery; For one who nothing knew of what is love: A wretch, a serpent, that betray'd my heart With mad ambition, woman's constant curse. Blind that I was to see no further on! Contempt, derision, from the chaste and true: And not to know the lowly daisy pure Stands far superior to the rotted rose. But, ah! Derision was my easiest woe. My tempter, how unlike my Mortimer! Knew not to heal the wound he gave my peace: Impetuous, self-will'd, and proud, he strove, But strove in vain: and though when Edward died He led me to the altar black in crime, My heart was sicker for't; and at the altar Sure Heav'n sent down the curse that hath pursu'd me. Edw. Great pow'rs above! Why seek'st thou then again The hateful cause of all thy misery? Oh! rather fly to the remotest end Of this sad globe. My unknown duty sped, Thy steps I'll lead, and in thy service die. Luc. Listen good youth! I'll tell thee all my sorrow: Where more secure can confidence repose Than in the bosom of such good affection? Orlando is my husband; and I've sworn The tenor of my future days shall be Most exemplary: for let come what may, Edward, I ne'er again will quit the path Of pure and steady duty. Ah! what ills For ever spring from faithless deviation! Remitless vengeance! Pity me, oh Edward! From year to year, for three successive years, The sweetest infants smil'd their thanks for life; From year to year the unremitted curse Tore from my arms the heav'nly babes, nor did The mother's joys reward the mother's pangs. Oh Henry, Laura, Caroline! Oh! Oh! Edw. Prithee have patience. How thou rend'st my heart! Luc. Dear Edward! they but liv'd to smile and die. They smil'd benign, as 'twere to raise my hope, Then sudden frown'd a curse, and died. Edw. In mercy drop the piteous recollection, And wave awhile the bitter tale. Luc. They died. And yetâOh! that's a thought I've done my utmost To discourage. No, no, I will not hope, Lest disappointment turn my feeble brain, And madness tip my tongue with blasphemy. I have no daughterâno, I have no child, For she is deadâalas! she must be dead: Eternal Justice will have rul'd it so. Edw. What mean'st thou Lady? Luc. Nay, I know not whatâ But that perhaps I have a daughter still. Full sixteen years are past since I resolv'd To expiate, if expiate I could; And vow'd in favour of an Infant's life To leave the suckling e'er it press'd my bosom, And by a Pilgrimage atone my crimes. I never told Orlando of the child, For he had drawn the curses on our heads, But left his Castle in the dead of night, And hid me for awhile beneath the shed Of Mark, a trusty Vassal, and his wife. With them I left my little Magdeline, And, by a solemn awful sacrament A lasting silence on their lips I seal'd, On no pretext, however urgent 'twere, To own her noble birth, 'till I return'd, Or she had reach'd her eighteenth year; But as their own to rear my hapless babe. Edw. See, yonder hies a merry company; Haply the inmates of your Castle, Lady: And one dismounts who bears a portly mien. Luc. Where? 'Tis most likelyâbut make nought of me, For I must reach the cottage on my feet; Few are miles: by dark we shall be there: Then Beatrice will tell me all my fateâ If she's alive!â Edw. And once thy penance o'er, My fate I'll likewise seek; mysterious fate, Seal'd with a dying Father's hallow'd blood. Enter Orlando. Orl. They seem to shun my steps. This wand'ring tribe Assume the face and garb of piety Merely to give their idleness a cloak. Re-enter Edward. Edw. As thou art noble quit the path we tread, And onward hasten, or return thy steps: My fair companion would not here be seen. Perchance ere long, Sir, thou may'st know her better. Orl. And who art thou? Edw. Alas! one, who in life Holdeth no consequence to talk of: who Now treadeth British ground, unknowing why, And step by step advances to a deed Conceal'd, yet terrible. Orl. Out from my sight! Thou vagrant! nor bring thy magic here, To scare the unprepar'd with mystery And showâAvaunt! Edw. Though young, I long have learnt, thou blusterer, The barking cur is not the dog that bites. Orl. Hah! Death shall follow thy presumption. (Handles a dagger. Lucretia runs forward. Luc. Turn, turn, Orlando, to thy long lost wife. (Orlando starts. Edw. (aside). Orlando's self! Luc. Wilt thou not speak, Orlando? Not cheer me by a word, a kind embrace? Hast thou forgot me? Look again: indeed I am Lucretia, indeed I am.âThou seem'st O'erpower'd with amazement. Orl. Thou'rt a spirit. Edw. (aside). How doth the guilty soul appal herself! Orl. I do conjure thee, waft her back from where Thy magic art hath rais'd her up.âAway! What would'st thou?âWill not sixteen years Suffice? Dost rise at this long date to claim Further fidelity to the cold tomb? Why hast thou left thy grave? Luc. I am thy wife! Orl. Thou art not flesh and blood, but merely vapour. Luc. He thinks me dead, and takes me for a spiritâ Stretch forth thy hand and be convinc'd:âthereâthere. Orl. Thou feel'st of substance; but my harrow'd soul Hath so disorder'd all corporeal sense, I scarce can credit what I see or touch. Art thou indeed alive? Luc. Alive! Oh Life! I've dragg'd it wearily a length of way, And brought it back but just in time, I fear, To throw it down before thee.âYes, I liveâ In Heav'n's good time I shall be dead. Edw. (aside). Alas! 'Tis but a frigid welcome for thee, Lady. Luc. What ails thee, my Orlando? Why dost muse? Orl. (aside). Oh coward heart! Luc. Orlando! Orl. (aside). Ay, Mark knew itâ But he shall rue this artful silence yet, And blast his tongue that could not break an oath. Luc. Wilt thou not speak to me? Is this my welcome? Orl. Forgive, Lucretia, this my mortal frailty. Amazement hath enchain'd my faculties: I long have thought thee deadâCome to my arms, And hush thy sorrows to eternal rest. Luc. Joy! Joy! And wilt thou love me still, Orlando? But hold awhileâI must not yet encroach Upon my almost ended Pilgrimage: A penance dure, and, which, but for this youth, Had long since found a hapless period. Orl. I'm proud of nature, Sir; You will excuse The roughness of't. Edw. Of humblest nature I: Yet want not mind to turn aside the foot That strives to spurn me:âprompt to forgive; For calm acknowledgement, though ne'er so slight, Conquers at once my peaceful heart, and gains An easy reconcilement. Luc. Now, my Lord, Awhile depart, and leave me to my penance: Thou had'st not seen me till my task was o'er, But for the purpose of preventing anger.â Now go, and have the Castle well prepar'dâ I have a thousand, thousand things to tellâ It will be late ere we arrive, and these Few hours will seem almost as long as all. Orl. (aside). Most fortunate! (to Luc.) Indeed, I must not goâ Luc. In this be rul'd by me? this once be rul'd. Orl. Well! to prepare thee a most kind receptionâ For this I do esteem my bridal night. Luc. How gratefully my heart doth thank thee for it:â Yet ere you go, my Lord, I fain would hear, Fond woman! what to hear perhaps is deathâ Hath Beatrice a child alive?âa Daughter? Orl. Ha! where hast thou heard it? 'tis false I say.â Luc. Alas! I thought it must be soâyet Justice Might have been apppeas'dâOh Magdeline! Orl. (aside) So the old sycophant hath been before me. Luc. I'll bear it wellâyet, yet I'll see it out, Nor leave the tyrant Pow'rs one ray of mercy.â Mark then told you when she diedâtold all. Orl. Mark told me when she died!âher brain is phrensiedâ What means my Love? The child of Mark still lives, A blooming lovely rustic. Luc. Ha! doth she live? is Magdeline alive? Orl. (aside). I know not what to think: she either knows, Or she suspects me faithless. (to Luc.) Prithee why Such question and concern for Magdeline? Luc. Thou must not taste it now: no, that shall be A feast at night, when we have reach'd the Castle. Oh! we've abundant joy in store, my Lord. Away! Orl. So thou wilt have it for a while: We part to meet at night.â(aside) Reason hath lost her poise. (Exit Orlando. Luc. She lives! Edward, she lives! my infant lives! Infant!âwhy she is near as old as thou: A comely beauteous maid.âI told thee, Edward, How interceding Saints had gain'd me mercy. Edw. My heart, still true, participates thy joy: Oh may'st thou never feel a sorrow more! Luc. Now let us bend our steps towards the Castleâ The twilight wanes apace, and soon will fail usâ Still must I hold thy arm, thou worthy youth! But Magdeline shall thank her Mother's friend.

We have, my Lord! and are not us'd to flinch. Orl. Then look for larger payment as ye thrive.â Some five miles hence, within the forest precinct, She must be still upon the broadest path; And quick dipatch will bring you with her there: Old Mark, who came to tell of her arrival, Is gone to meet her; but before he makes The shorter path to join the greater road, Ye may o'ertake her long; for fleeter Barbs Are not on English ground, than are the three That only wait your mounting, 2d Ruf.

So much for thatâWhy let them call it murder. When noble souls goaded by great Ambition, Perceive the path that leads the tow'ring wish Cross'd by some futile life, superfluous air, They give the bubble vent, and pass along. Yet what's Ambition to the goad I feel! This step secures my bliss:âYet should they fail, I'll bring religion to my aidâthe Churchâ For Popes and Monks can sanctify each act, And mar the possibility of guilt. Enter Magdeline. Mag. What is't disturbs your breast? Is ought amiss? Orl. Oh woman! what a source of joy art thou! The heav'nly refuge from all mortal care! Delicious antidote of venom'd thought! Syren! that draws us headlong into bliss. Mag. I hope, my Lord, you think no evil of me: I would not for my life so bear myself, As to be charg'd with semblance of a Syren. My Lord! you're ill; and gaze most wildly on me: Indeed, indeed, you fright me very much. Orl. Gaze on thee! I could gaze for everâ Thus Appius gaz'd upon the Roman maid, And struck at Justice for the bliss he hop'dâ Thus gaz'd young Tarquin on the Roman dame, And lost his kingdom for the pleasing transportâ Thus gaz'd Atrides on the Trojan slave, And with Achilles' wrath prolong'd the warâ Thus ever gaz'd the God of Love, and thusâ Mag. My Lord! I do not comprehend your words, I scarce can stand, and my heart palpitates. Orl. Thy heart now pants with overwhelming Love. Mag. It pants with fear to see you thus, my Lord! Whither, oh! whither are my parents fled? Oh send me, send me to their rev'rend arms; Where I could live most humble and content. For Love is not a stranger to my heart: I know it well, and cannot yield, Orlando! To be deceiv'd, and call a demon Love. For Love is calm, is joy, is brightness all; Attends the wishes of the object lov'd, And swiftly flies to execute the wish; Then sits repos'd, and meditating good; But never looks as ready to destroy. Orl. Perverse fatality! this very pureness But heaps the fuel on, and fires me more. Mag. My Lord! how very strange it doth appear To leave our friends, and now the hour of parting; I came to urge you back. Orl. Lead, lead the way: If Love be such, Nature is then a Demon. (Exeunt. Scene.âThe Forest. Enter Edward and Lucretia. Edw. How far'st thou now? Luc. Why bravely, bravely, Edward! Th' exhausted animal, the faint machine, Hath been wound up anew: fresh hope instill'd, Dear Edward, never fails to give fresh spirits: Nay I could walk all night, sweet sleep defy, And dance exulting on my journey's end. Edw. I fear the weather for thee: and thy strength, However better'd by supplying Hope, Is yet too low to reach the Castle gates, Before some two hours henceâ'tis dark already: I pray we may not have a stormâthe calm And heat intense portended this. Luc. It seems To threaten usâI hope it will not come; Yet fearless I could set me down, and brave The boist'rous winds, beneath a friendly hedge. I've ta'en a cordial, that will make me proof. Amid a thousand present ills I'd sit To meditate to-morrow's joy, and lose Immediate sense in blest anticipation. Edw. Methought I heardâ Luc. What dost thou see? What is't thou look'st at, Edward? Edw. Be not alarm'dâfor though I have a doubt Foul play is meant us, yet thou need'st not fear: I have a heart will scare a dozen rogues; And here are only three. Luc. See they dismount, Intent on mischiefâthey are villains, Edward! Ah my frail nature! sure they will not kill us.â Edw. We'll make alliance with this friendly oak.â I am not without arms; this trusty point Is made of toughest iron, and will give A fatal blow to unprovok'd oppression. Enter the Ruffians. 1st Ruf. You are sure he is unarm'd? 2d Ruf. My Lord told me so. 1st Ruf. Then what is that he carries in his hand? 3d Ruf. Why he's a Pilgrim: can't you perceive it is the Cross. 1st Ruf. If that be all, we'll cross him presently. You know our agreementâdispatch him out of hand, and bind her: 'tis time enough to send her to Heaven. Edw. Off, villains, off. (They attack Edward, who keeps his ground, till one of the Ruffians forces him to quit it, by slipping behind the tree.âHe beats the other two off the Stage.) Luc. (to one of the Ruffians, who struggles to bind her.) Oh Heav'n! I pray you do not kill me, Sir! What would you of so poor a wretch as I? Now, as you hope for mercy, spare my life! Help! Edward, help! Help! Help! (Edward returns, and beats off the Ruffian.) Luc. Oh! do not leave me: Edward, return! thou can'st not overtake themâ For Mercy's sake return! (Edward returns, and she runs to him.) Edw. They will not rally; For cowardice, that clings to villany, Spurs on their flight, and gives the speed of wings. Come now, take courage. Mark (within). Ho! Lucretia! Edw. Softly! Mark (within). Lucretia! what, Lucretia! ho! Lucretia! Luc. What can this mean? perhaps my Lord hath sentâ Edw. Retire, and let me speak. Mark (within). What! ho! Lucretia! Enter Mark. Edw. Whom seek'st thou, Sir? Mark. Oh! hast thou seen a Lady Traverse the Forest in a Pilgrim's garb? Edw. I have; and now what would'st thou with the Lady? Mark. Oh bring me to her, Sir! She is my Lady. I heard a fray: I hope no harm hath reach'd herâ Ha! by my hopes, thou art the very youth Who tends upon her stepsâShe must be nearâ Where art thou, Madam? 'tis Mark, old Mark, Thy faithful servant Mark, that callsâSirâIâ Nay, tell me, is the Lady's name Lucretia? Luc. Oh! my good friend, it is, it is Lucretia. Mark. Blest be the hour! this is the act of Heav'n; And welcome! welcome! thus on my knees Oh! suffer me to kiss these welcome hands. Luc. And art thou still alive? my good old friend! And still the father of my Magdeline? Oh thou'rt a worthy good old man. Mark. Ah! Madam! Still do I tremble at the recollection:â My dreadful oathâOrlandoâ Luc. I've seen Orlando, Here in the forest, while the sun was setting: He told me of my child, and Heav'n be prais'd She lives to recompence my suff'rings all. Oh! you must all of you have thought me dead: But now the worst is past, we'll grieve no more, For lasting joy is come again amongst us. Mark. Then Heav'n be prais'd! and sure I will not mar The present joys.âThe blessed Saints have sent thee: Yet wish I must, (my heart is us'd to bode) The virtues thou bring'st back may find reward. Luc. Nay, do not doubt it, Mark! my Lord is gone, Yielding to my inflexible request, Against his inclination gone, to make The Castle ready for his Pilgrim guests. There stands, my friend, a paragon for youth: Embrace him, Mark! for he hath sav'd me twice, And times unnumber'd hath reliev'd my pains. Mark. Nay, I could love him for his mien alone, That speaks his heart to be both brave and good. Edw. Good Sir! thy presence is most timely for us, And hath reliev'd thy Lady of her fears. Luc. I had forgot them at the sight of Mark: Though scarce a second ere thou cam'st my life Was at the stake: ah! had'st thou seen my champion, How bravely he oppos'd himself to three, And singly vanquish'd their united force! Oh my deliverer! (Takes Edward's hand, he kisses hers. Edw. Such recompence Would tempt a wish for further proofs of service. Sir, are these villanies committed often? Mark. Once is too oft; for in the Forest grounds I never recollect the like before; And my suspicious soul forebodes no good. Edw. Thou need'st not fear, they will not come again. Mark. The coursers which they rode, I saw them fly, Are far too good to call such villains mastersâ Ah Madam! was Orlando kind? Luc. He was. Mark. What! very kind? Luc. When once his wonder dropt, His kindness overflow'd: he would have stay'd; But I denied, and forc'd him to the Castle. Mark. Then to the Castle let us follow quick: And to the utmost urge thy strength, dear Lady! For I have horrid doubts I fain would end. Luc. Well, Mark! end how they will, I'll not complain: Refin'd attention long hath pass'd my hopes. Edw. That's well resolv'd:âlet's on; the wind increases, And sulphur fills the air. Mark. Pray use our arms, For on we mustâI'll lead the shortest way. Luc. See my supports! brave Edward, and the Cross! The strength that bore me homeward to my joys. (Exeunt. Scene.âThe Castle. Enter Magdeline and Constance. Con. Think better of your lot, my dearest Lady. Mag. Oh! Constance! I've already overleap'd The frightful precipice of Misery: And all day long have felt increasing swiftness, Doubling each instant, speed me to the bottom, Where must be dash'd my ev'ry hope of comfort. Con. 'Tis now too late. Mag. Alas! it is, it is. Con. Then make the best of the necessity. Mag. Oh! what a comfort that! so Dev'ls themselves May make the best of their damnation too. Con. I fain would comfort if I could, but fear The evil is by much too deeply rooted. Is such reluctance to apparent good Th' effect alone of virgin modesty? Ah! Magdeline! I dread some prior love Hath ta'en possession of your tender heart. Mag. True Constance, true! I'll tell thee whom I love. Con. Nay do not tellâI dread the confidenceâ For should Orlando ever knowâ Mag. The love That Magdeline confesses now, good Constance! Will neither make her blush, nor bring thee danger.â Oh Mark! oh Beatrice! why have ye left me? Why have ye now forsaken me? at last Giv'n me to Sorrow's chain, when ye so long Had fed my hopes ye never would consent? 'Twas ye possess'd the love of Magdeline. Yes Constance! 'twas my father and my motherâ And they have giv'n me upâthyself my Constance The dreadful sentence brought, the joyless letter, That robb'd their daughter of her mortal peace:â And then to urge it in their absence too. Con. 'Tis hard indeed! but trust me had you seen The piteous manner of the aged pair, Your heart had melted in their gratitude. Mag. Yet, oh! it shudders at its gloomy prospect: I never, never can approve Orlando; For he's so boist'rous, and so little lov'd Of any, and so little amiable:â His very kindness seems to me all rage. Con. 'Tis youth and inexperience that talk thus: Orlando hath a comeliness and beauty, That surely might awake within your breast The riper feelings of impassion'd love. Mag. Impassion'd love! alas! I know not passionâ My blood is icicled to all mankind; And all the love I know is calm and pure. Con. Come, come, my Lady! I too am a womanâ You may, demurely if you will, deny The genial feelings Nature's self matures, But I know well there's none exempt her law. Mag. Now then, Constance! by all the Saints I swear I know not what thou mean'st. Con. Nay, do not swear.â Why after all then did you give consent? Mag. That, that indeed is Nature's work: I own The influence. All Nature cries, return! Give good for evil is a law divine; But good for good's a law e'en mortal Nature Could suggest, and Dev'ls alone deny.â Constance! I owe Orlando much; a debt I must repay, e'en though I lose myself. Yes, I will strive to conquer misery, Catch at each twig to flatter me with bliss, And try at least to hide my pangs from him. (Exeunt. Enter Orlando. Now, by my stars! such formal friendship tires: I thought they never would have left the Castle.â Ere this my ruffians have dispos'd their preyâ Murder my wife! why will the thought intrude? Rebellious thought! that will not yield obedience To any sway.âI'll think of Magdeline, Who now prepares with panting expectationâ Panting her last breathâwhile Hugo's dagger Reeks with the parting lifeâAh bloody villain! Another purse would point the weapon here.â Oh! coward, coward heart!âwhat! shall I ne'er Shake off these fev'rish apprehensions? Dwelling on horrid phantasies, though vain, Till my disorder'd frame is all on motion, And my soul harrow'd by ideal forms. Avaunt ye idle dreams! my Magdeline Henceforth shall banish ev'ry thought but Love. (Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene.âThe Castle. Enter Orlando. Orlando. Oh treach'rous, treach'rous fate! not Wisdom's self, Nor all the caution of most wily cunning, Can see or move thy adamantine law: Thou mock'st the height of human circumvention. Who would have thought the villains could have fail'd? Oh! shame on manhood! shame upon all daring! What horrid sounds to hear the noisy gate Thunder confusion to my joys!âBut nowâ What's to be done? I'll not resign the cup Just as I've rais'd it to my thirsty lip. Soft! let me see! this is the Friar's chamberâ Good father Jeremy! my holy father! He stirsâthis fearful boist'rous night at least Hath giv'n me time to meditate my plan; For Lucrece and her fools, all dripping wet, Will take some time to change their drenched garments: Meanwhile the Priest I'll sound upon the case Of doubtful marriages, and if a flaw We cannot find, we'll make a score between us. He comes; now for a test of monkish virtue.â Enter Jeremy. Orl. 'Tis meet I crave thy pardon, holy father, For this my interruption of thy rest. Jer. My Son! my rest hath long been interrupted: For who could rest in such a night as this, When all the elements appear at variance, And seem to threaten a returning Chaos:â The sins of men might hasten such event. Orl. Father! we are indeed a sinful race: We all do sin, e'en when we know it sinful: Though truly there be some who sin unknowing. Jer. The laws of Heav'n, unlike the laws of man, Will take but small account of ignorance. Orl. Ah! holy Jeremy! what consolation Do thy heav'nly spirit and eloquence Convey to feeble consciences like mine! To calm my anxious state of mind, good Father! And lay the tempest that disturbs my soul, Is the sad cause that calls thee from thy chamber. I know thee well, good Jeremy! most holy, Most learned, pious, and devout thou art: On such a Saint dependence is secure. Jer. My Son; I am no better than I should be. Orl. Nay Jeremy! Trust me I do not think a holier Saint Will e'er be found among the whole communion: And all thy modesty but adds to merit. Father! there is a matter that disturbs My wakeful conscience, and destroys my peace. Jer. Speak, Son! and let me ease thy loaded soul. Orl. Most holy Jeremy! what faith the Church, And how doth she direct the man to act, Who having ample reason to believe His Consort long had rested in her grave, And many years had past, and all the world Believ'd her dead, had ta'en another wife, When starts me up the former, and lays claim? Jer. The Church, my Son, can do whate'er she pleases. Orl. Most certainly she can; I know it well, And he's a heretic who holds it other. There are indeed some rash advent'rous Imps Who wander round and preach a diff'rent doctrine, Raising strange doubts about St. Peter's chair, Th' infallibility of his Successor, And vainly ridicule our holy worship. But I have taught the world, thou know'st I have, To argue right and holily; to know And own the delegate of our religion. Jer. Thou hast defended well our holy faith. Orl. Oh Jeremy! my happiness is all At stake, but thou might'st yet command the die. Jer. As how, my Lord? Orl. Why thus, good Jeremy! I call'd thee to impart my dismal fate. Father! alas! I have unknowing sinn'd Against our holy Church, and my sad mind Repenting of the deed of ignorance, Sighs but to remedy the fatal act. Thou knew'st Lucretiaâ Jer. Who? Thy former Lady? Poor dame! she was a faithful penitent: Too hard the penance she resolv'd to suffer, For crimes that had their origin with thee. Orl. For crimes, my Father, fully done away By absolution from thy sacred lips. Jer. Well, well, my Son! but what of thy lost consort? Orl. I'm told she's yet aliveâ Jer. Alive! my Lord! Orl. Nay, so I hear: did not the noisy knocking Of her messenger invade thine ear? Jer. Most loudlyâbut alive! impossible. Orl. If I should see her, I could doubt mine eyes, And call it sorcery. Jer. A miracle. Orl. Yet should it be, good Father! sure 'twere hard Now to forego the bliss I just have tasted. Nor should my Magdeline be made the victimâ Say! holy Jeremy! Jer. The case is awful, And requires, my Son, great meditation. Orl. Thou can'st not but reflect the one hath been The instrument herself of the disaster, The other pure e'en as the path to Heav'n. Jer. When Passions lead, my Lord, the tongue is prompt, And argument presents a thousand sources.â Lucretia would do well to dedicate Her future life to purer services. Orl. There rose the pious man in thought to Heav'n! 'Twere a most holy deed to fix her there: So long an absence quite annuls our marriage. Jer. The absence truly hath been very long. Orl. And sure 'tis time she might forsake the world. Jer. But where, where is Lucretia? Orl. Oh my Father! Forgive, forgive the little fraud I've practis'd, To learn thy pious sentiment. Alas! No messenger is come, but she herselfâ She, she herself is come. Jer. Amazement! Orl. Hell! Jer. Is her arrival known? Orl. To very few. Jer. In such a night.âCame she alone, my Lord? Orl. Mark and a comely unknown youth came with her: They have retir'dâbut, Father, lose no timeâ Lucretia, with intemp'rate joy, declares She will not rest, though dying with fatigue, Till she hath cloath'd herself, and spread around Much unexpected bliss. Oh Jeremy! Befriend the man who would for thee and faith Spill the last drop of mortal blood: persuade, Father! persuade her with the dawning day To leave the Castle still to peace and joy, And at Devotion's shrine seek peace herself. Jer. My Son! thy happiness I feel is mine. Orl. Then come, and let me show thee to her chamber. I'll gain admittance for thee, then return, And here impatient wait the wish'd success. (Exeunt. Scene opens and discovers Edward on a couch. Edw. My bones all ache, with this long march fatigu'dâ I die for sleep, but sleep denies her boonâ My patient Pilgrim rests as ill I fear: Her Lord's but little better than a Devil:â (Rises and comes forward. My father's image haunts my weary brainâ Ah poor Lucretia! had Alonzo known thee, Spite of thy single crime, he would have lov'd thee. While silence reigns, and Sleep my wooing flies, I'll meditate the deed my father doom'd me. Come forth, thou sacred paper; now come forth! Ah! precious, precious blood! thy sanguine hue Is fled, but now I feel thee in my face, That deeply crimsons at my shameful sloth. Now for my fateâAnd now again I swear, Swear by this relict of my father's blood, Which thus with filial reverence I kiss, Whate'er the deed he dooms, I will obey.â (reads. Ye gracious Powers! Lucretia is my mother! Oh villain! wanton! Diabolical! Yes he shall die, my Father, he shall die. (The last three lines are expressed after he begins to read the paper, as mov'd by what he reads.) Enter Mark. Mark. Oh gentle stranger! Edw. Sir, no stranger here, Nor gentle shalt thou find me.âvillain! villain! He thou call'st thy Lord is a damn'd villain. Mark. A matchless Dev'l! not to be pair'd from Hell. Edw. Thither I'll send him ere he lives an hour. Away! and let me meditate his fate. Mark. Would thou could'st remedy the fatal deed! I came to tell thee what I find thou know'st. My aged head is burden'd with the crime, And bears me down, a well-intention'd victim. Oh! would I had forsworn myself: good Edward! Behold in me the wretched cause of all. Edw. Then Hell prepares its hottest chamber for thee. Mark. Alas! if rigid virtue be a sinâ Edw. Yes! thou hast leagu'd with Lucrece all thy life: My Father is the victim of your crimesâ Away! if thou would'st live: that hoary head Averts my anger's edge, but haste away! Destruction is awake, and thirsts for blood: But first for stronger scented blood than thine. Mark. Now, by the Saints! young man, I scarcely know thee: And never hast thou seen lost Magdeline.â Poor Magdeline! alas! I might have sav'd her. Edw. Now what of Magdeline? no matter whatâ Go! leave me to digest the villany, And study my revengeâOrlando diesâ Mark. I pity, Edward, thy distracted state: Thou can'st not hate Orlando more than I. Edw. Thou know'st me not; Nor till this moment did I know myself: But now I feel the blood of Mortimer Swell in my heart, and boil along my veins. Mark. Heard I aright? say Mortimer again. Edw. Mortimer, MortimerâKnow'st thou the sound? Mark. Art thou the son of Edward Mortimer? It cannot be! such wonderful events Defy the laws of Chanceâ Edw. But not of Heav'n: I tell thee, 'tis the Law of Providence, And through my Father's voice Heav'n speaks its will. There, read conviction through my Father's blood. (Mark takes the Paper and reads.) âMy name is Edward Mortimerâthy mother Is alive, in Cornwall lives, in shameless And avow'd adult'ry livesâHer name Lucretia: Her base seducer is the Lord Orlandoââ Edw. Notorious villain! wanton, wanton, Lucrece! (Mark reads.) âI never gave thy mother cause to hate meââ Edw. To leave a man like Mortimer for him! (Mark reads.) âOrlando tempted her beyond her reason: For Reason scarce began to take the rein; So young and artless was my poor Lucretia. I sought revenge on honourable terms, But Richard then possess'd the English throne, Than whom a greater tyrant never reign'd: Orlando was his friend and partizan. I would have slain Orlando, but I found Ruffians were set about to seek and murder me. Thou wert the only child that Lucrece bore; With thee I fled to France: our ship was lost: Thou wert too young to bear it on thy mind: I held thee fast, and bore thee safe to shore, Then brought thee here to Milan, where thou know'st We have acquired fame, friends, and fortune too. Earl Richmond hath already conquer'd Richardâ To England now I'll goâbut should I die Before I reach the isle, let this instruct thee While the villain lives thou hast not done Thy Father's wish.ââ Edw. Now am I Mortimer? Mark. Oh Heav'n! thy gracious will be done! 'tis thine! Thy all directing finger points our fateâ I vouch the truth of what thy Father writes. Edw. My Father's truth did never need a voucher. Mark. We thought ye both had perish'd in the storm. Trust me, Orlando soon shall bite a dagger. Edw. Damn him! I'll make him bite the ground. Mark. Oh Edward! I never wrong'd, but always lov'd thy Father; And thou mistak'st the meaning of my words. Thy heart hath yet another woe to feel; Suspicion plac'd it foremost in my thought, And my first question damn'd me with the truth. But, Edward! let us leave this spot of horror: I'll lead thee through the cloister'd aisles, to where Thy mother, in her anguish, ere she went, Rais'd for her parted babes a Mausoleum. Edw. A solemn place, and fit for thoughts like mineâ There wilt thou counsel how to improve my vengeance Mark. I'll not oppose the justice of thy wrongs: For 'tis the will of Heav'n oft-times inflicts E'en in this world the punishment of crimes: And interposes here to teach mankind Enormous guilt may hasten retribution; And thus in hearts corrupt keep awe awake. (Exeunt. Scene opens, and discovers Lucretia gracefully dressed, and Jeremy. Luc. I tell thee, Father, he's a wicked man.â Oh! now I see the bottom of my fate, And know the murd'rer that hath sought my blood. Yes! I could dedicate my life to Heav'n: But oh! it were an impious sacrifice, That shameless villany might thrive the better.â Let him again consult to take my lifeâ Is this my welcome? this my other bridal? This the reward of my repentant tears? Jer. Lady! thy woes bring pity to my heart. Luc. Where is the dame that hath supplanted me? Who is she? doth she know Lucretia lives? Shame, shame upon them both! a worthless pair! Where is old Mark? Give me my daughter, Mark! And let us fly together from this scene. Jer. Good now! compose thy senses, lest they stray: Alas! thou can'st not well bear more. Luc. Bear more! Oh! let Orlando shrinkâhe too shall bear, And wish at last, when we his reach escape, He had again his daughter and his wife To sooth the pangs of conscienceâhe shall bearâ The time will comeâ Jer. What daughter dost thou mean? Luc. That rests with meâas for this wanton dame, Were she as fruitful as the springing grain, He dies apace, and cannot hope to see Another such as mineâWhere is Orlando? I'll see the wretch myself before I go. Jer. But let me see him first to urge thy right: Perhaps his heart is not so lost, but yet He may hear Reason's voice: I'll do my best. Luc. Go thenâI will reserve myself awhile, To pour the deluge of remorse upon him, And, if I can, drown all his sins to death. Jer. May Heav'n preserve thy understanding, Lady! (Exit. Lucretia alone, after a pause. It must! of magnitude so great my guilt, Life is too short to appease offended Heav'n. Oh Thou! who mad'st this earth the path of proof, Continue, oh! continue to inflict Thy salutary chastisements! Add here Pang to pang, and bitterness to sorrow! That mingled with the little weight of virtue, My heart so swol'n may draw the balance down, And crime so purified may touch the beam. (Exit. Enter Orlando and Jeremy, meeting. Orl. Now, by my hopes! here comes the Priest! well Father! Jer. My Son? I've seen Lucretia. Orl. Is she willing? Did'st thou persuade? will she devote her soul? Oh! ease me from the rack of my suspense! Jer. Indeed I fear her senses are not right. Orl. So, hast thou gain'd th'advantage of her weakness? Jer. I feel the wrongs of thy most injur'd Lady, And would redress, not heighten injury. Orl. 'Sdeath! art thou mad? Jer. My Son! my Son! Lucretia Is thy sole and lawful wife, howe'er Compassion subtly plead for Magdeline; Compassion, like an able orator, On either side speaks loudly, but is join'd Most audibly by Justice self for Lucrece. Orl. Do I hear right? sure thou mistak'st thy part? Jer. Sooth, as thou can'st, the woe of Magdeline: I'll join to ease the scruples of her mind, And teach how independent Virtue is Of all the organs of mortality; For nobly seated in the mind alone, The conscious mind alone can guilt create; And he that sees our inmost secrets there, Acquits all sin that lacks the cordial will. This may ease Magdeline; but for thy wifeâ Orl. How shall I vent my rage! Oh for a sword To send this treach'rous Priest to HellâOh villain: Thy boasted sanctity thou know'st, vile Priest, Is all hypocrisy: thou hast abus'd Our holy Faith with horrid superstitions.â 'Tis no spiritual, but a temp'ral case, And, spite of thee, my will shall be obey'd.â For this, thy whole fraternity repents: There's not a Roman, but shall feel the blow. Thou'st done an evil deed, St. Jeremy, For thee, and thy co-hypocritesâ'twill comeâ Luther advances from the Eastâalready His doctrines are arriv'd; Priest! I'll further themâ Thou know'st my pow'r: your monast'ries are gone; And e'en St. Peter trembles in his chair.â Away! fly from my wrath, thou reptile wretch! (Pushes him out. Enter Lucretia. Luc. Where is this Lord? this arbiter of fate? This great Orlando?âOh! my Lord! your servant. I come, by Father Jeremy's appointment, To meet my loving Lord, my kind Orlando; Who hath so studied my reception here, And longs to embrace me on my bridal night.â Now I am come, my Lord! what not a word? Orl. By Heav'n! she looks as beauteous as an angel, And far excels whate'er she was before. Luc. Well may'st thou hide that shameless head, Orlando!â What have I done? tell me, what have I done? 'Gainst thee I never sinn'dâ'gainst Heav'n, indeed, Full sorely sinn'd!âbut 'twas for thee I sinn'd.â Was't not enough to throw me from thy bed, What could provoke thee to the thought of murder? Orl. No, on my soul, I never urg'd them to it. Luc. Thy tongue denies what yet thy looks confess. Orl. Nay, by the Heav'ns I swear! Luc. That Jeremy Came not commission'd to exile me hence. Orl. Exile thee hence, Lucretia! where's the knave? Oh shame upon the Priest! exile thee hence! I'd lose my life before thou should'st go hence.â I never saw thee half so fair before:â Thou can'st not be the Pilgrim just arriv'd, But some fair spirit now re-animating All that was ever lovely in that form. By Heav'n! I feel captivity return, And chains more soft than when I saw thee first. Thus let me welcome back such loveliness. Luc. Deceitful man! Orl. No: on my soul 'tis truth; And all my former love comes rushing on me: I sip th' intoxicating draught again, And never more will think but of Lucretia. Ah! where hast thou regain'd thy magic? Luc. Murder! Orl. By ev'ry saint I swear! I'm ignorant. Luc. Thy marriage:âwert thou ignorant of that, When on the Forest road we met this even? Orl. Hear me, Lucretia! Luc. Wert thou ignorant Of the good Friar's visit, and it's import? Orl. Hear me I prayâI sent indeed the Friarâ But 'twas to soften what I could not tell: I meant to follow the sad tale myself; To sooth, lament, and counsel with thee on't; Then to pursue whate'er we thought were best.â The bigot Monkâ Luc. Melted with humanity, And here return'd to urge the plea of Justice.â I know't, my Lord! but where's the dame supplants me? Yetâah! poor Lady! she is innocent; Nor knew the claim, that crept along the earth, And hither slowly bent to her destruction. Orl. Plague on her! would I ne'er had seen the wretch? My Love! thy pity will diminish greatly, When thou reflect'st (I speak it to my shame) She is the daughter of a Vassal merely; And shall not think herself a loser by it. Come, come Lucretia! and confess thyself, That this event, in absence of an age, Is not surprising. Had these charms been here, I never could have been unfaithful to them. For the aspiring wench we'll think no more: She shall be satisfied; let us be happy. Luc. Satisfied! ill betide her if she be! What can be satisfaction for dishonour? Her Parents tooâAlas! to think of them! Can they be satisfied? Orl. Hast thou not heard? Mark hath been silent on this head I find. What! said he nothing on the subject to thee? Luc. Nothing: and yet I well remember now, His words bore something of a mystery. Orl. Mysterious fool! had he been frank with me, We had been sav'd these pangs, and he had sav'd, What I suppose he thinks most valuable, His daughter's chastity.â Luc. Daughter! what daughter? Orl. I know thou lov'st them, and wilt therefore pity. Luc. Avenging pow'rs!âYe have not this in storeâ Or if ye have, oh! rein up ev'ry organ! Strike me with deafness! oh! let me not hear, Lest I go mad, the name of Magdeline! Yet if I must, come Monster! strike me dead; Heav'n interposes not: complete thy workâ The sound of Magdeline will reach my heart.â Orl. 'Tis Magdelineâbut whereforeâ Lucretia kneeling. Now, now hear me! Now that the last most bitter draught is comeâ If there's a grain of Justice left in Heav'n, If all it's gall is not quite drain'd on me, Pour the remainder on this Monster's head! Invent above new tortures for the wretch! Give him to feel the quickest pangs of conscience! Open his eyes upon a gulf of fire! Set Hell before him ev'ry step he takes! Let angry spirits keep him ever wakeful! And hideous Dev'ls distract him in his dreams! Rob him of rest! appal his heart with fears! Curse him with quickest sensibility! And thus continue to him length of life! That of the bitter cup he gave to me, He too may drink! Oh for my child have mercy! Let her not live to know her misery! And curse the source and me in one sad breath! Let not these eyes behold her while she lives! But take her hence this night before she wakes! Shut mortal sense! and let her wake in Heav'n! Spare! spare her innocence the pangs of guilt! Oh Death! dear Death! spread thy kind veil upon her! Cover my child! andâandâandâ (Here expression fails, she falls back, and the Scene closes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene.âThe Mausoleum. Enter Edward and Mark. Edward. Thy age and wisdom should have taught thee better: Virtue to such extreme becomes a vice. Whoever takes an oath to act a crime, Is bound to break his oath, and Heav'n absolves. Thou should'st have broke ten thousand thousand oaths, Rather than suffer'd such a blot on Nature: 'Twas superstitious bigotry, not virtue. Mark. Alas! I thought (and who would not have thought?) That Lucrece' presence would have been enough. Spare me reproaches, Edward! my old heart Is not so wither'd with the blast of time, Or harden'd by experience, but it feels Acutest pangs for such unearn'd reproach. Involuntary guilt! yet guilty still. Would that my death could wipe away affliction! Would that my death could wipe the crime away! Edw. Forgive me, Mark! I did not mean to add Reproach to sorrow: sorrow such as thine. I love thy virtues, and I share thy grief. My heart is doubly loaded: think, ah! think, Good Mark! how few my years, and yet how bitter! I just began to know my Father's value, When I lost himâI find a Mother then, But find, alas! that Mother an adultressâ A Sister too! a Sister! Charming and innocent, lost ere she's found. Mark. Oh Edward! how I dread the morn's approach, When Magdeline must meet her Mother's eye, And the poor child be stunn'd with infamy. Edw. Oh the villain! no, she must not, shall not hear it. In this I'll be the guardian of her peaceâ Can we procure his horses? Mark. What if we can? Edw. I'll send her hence this very moment, Mark! I'll snatch her from the villain's arms, and bar By distance, and by ever watchful care, All avenues of her unhappy story. On thee she looks as on her father still, With thee will fly unconscious of the shame And long may dwell on earth with peace of mind. Mark. Oh! bless thee for the thought, thou child of Virtue!â There's scarce a man about him but detests him, Who would not rather injure than assist.â But how to wrest the victim from his talons? I fear, I fear, the failure of the plan. Edw. At least we'll tryâthou say'st the villain boasts His skill at swords? Mark. He hath the fame through England. Edw. Then will he meet my challenge readily: Meanwhile seek Magdeline, and fly the Castle. Lodge her where not a soul that now surrounds us May dream to find her; when securely lodg'd, Seek in disguise Report's more open paths: There suit thy action with the known event. If Heav'n decree, the Tyrant still must live, Old as thou art, thou must move actively. These tablets will be good credentials for thee: And here's my purse, that still continues heavy: At Milan fix thy charge, and tell my tale; There's not a soul, but who will give her welcome: Leave to oblivion and the wretch the deed, That, known but once, forever mars her peace. As for thyself, support thy spirits well, That thou may'st well perform, what now thou ow'st; Nor judge thy part by its forlorn event, For Heav'n regards the pious motives better. And for my Mother, if she'll follow, well: If not, why leave her to herself and Heav'n. Mark. I'll do my best, if Heav'n but give me strength. But oh! let pity plead thy Mother's cause! Misled not vile, seduc'd but not deprav'd; And for one frailty, a long life of woe. Edw. What root could Virtue in that mind have ta'en, That could be swept away by such a puff, As this Orlando? Mark! before I knew She was my Mother, I did doat upon her: But then to think how she hath us'd my Father. Mark. Oh! thou forget'st her many, many virtues. Edw. Were they as brilliant as the stars of Heav'n, The wrongs of Mortimer would tarnish all.â While thou prepar'st thy flight, I'll to my Mother, And find how stands her mind towards my plan; Then meet thee at the villain's chamber door.â So make good speedâthe storm is past, it clears, And the old moon will light thee on thy way. Mark. Oh! spare thy Mother; and remember, Edward! That Heav'n wills mercy, and not sacrifice. Exeunt. Scene.âOrlando's Apartments. Enter Orlando. The Theban felt not half my weight of guilt.â What did the Theban? pluck out both his eyes: He could not bear to see offended Natureâ He pluck'd out both his eyes for very grief.

I have revolv'd thee:â Now, now stand forth the friend of Innocence. If Magdeline awake, she wakes to horror: Sleep keeps her safely in the paths of peace:â Then make her sleep forever. Horror, madness, Can never follow into purer realms.â Lucretia's curses fall upon me thickâ Death is the sole atonement in my pow'r, 'Tis all I now can give to make her happy, And thus resolv'd, I bear the bloody gift.

Ah! what a softness overwhelms my bosom! A fondness, yet unfelt, invades my soul. (Kisses her hand. Luc. Go, go, Orlando. Edw. Orlando! oh Heav'ns! Her very dreams are all of himâSad woman! Yes! I will tell her she's a wanton woman; And if she will not leave these damned walls, Why let her stay, and feed upon th' event: Come forth my Father! speak to her thyself: And I will witness how she bears thy words. (He lays the paper on her pillow. The time's too short, she must no longer sleep. Lucrece! awake! is this a time for sleep? Luc. Who calls? It was the voice of Mortimer: I know it well: come hither, Love! where am I? I shall go madâmy brain is burstingâOh! Where's Mercy fled? and where doth Justice hide? They are not known on earthâthey are in Heav'nâ They areâwhat's here? a paper on my pillowâ Perhaps it brings advice from Heav'nâsome Angel Dropt it hereâI think 'tis stain'd with blood: Did not young Edward talk of such a paper? (Reads. Oh Heav'n! he is my Sonâwhere, where is Edward? Where is my Mortimer? my Mortimer! (Edward comes forward. Edw. Read the sad story of thy injur'd husband. Luc. I know it allâbut oh! I never knewâ Thou art indeed my Son. Edw. I am the Son Of him that onceâmy Mother! oh! my Mother! I am thy Son. (They embrace. Luc. Oh! my sweet Mortimer! My Son! my Edward! my dear Mortimer! When first I lov'd thee, had I not good reason? Edw. The same good reason sway'd it not my heart? Luc. Oh! thou'rt the very stamp of Mortimer.â Where, where have been my eyes this many a day, To let thee pass! my Son, my Son, my Son! And so thy Father died in battle, Edward? Edw. My Father, Madam, should have been alive. Luc. Why so he shouldâI thought he had been drown'dâ Thought! what a thought! oh wicked, wicked deed! Edw. Ay 'twas a wanton deed, by Hell inspir'd. Oh! how unlike the Roman Lucrece thou! Luc. A wanton deed! by Heav'n! it is not true; Nor through these veins flow blood, less pure than hers, Whose well lost life, whose honour franchis'd Rome.â Before I was thy mother, thou could'st pity; Now, now I am thy mother, thou would'st scorn. Hath Mortimer commanded thee to kill me? Oh! if he hath, I'll welcome the keen edge: But no, thou can'st not, 'twould be parricide! Edw. Forgive me, oh! forgiveâI'll err no moreâ Indeed, indeed, I had forgot myself: Forgot how far too great thy suff'rings were.â Now let me lead thee from this curs'd abode. Luc. Oh! 'twere a charity in Heav'n to take me. I'm sure my senses will not last me long.â Thy sister, EdwardâOh! my Magdelineâ Edw. She shall fly with us, Madam, andâ Luc. She's wedded. Edw. Alas! Luc. The Father weds the Daughter; Edward! Far, far I journey'd, to behold my child, And then I found her in her Father'sâah! Who says 'tis chance or fate? says he not true? There's not a Saint in Heav'n but has deceiv'd me: I'll face them with't, if they'll come down; for I Must ne'er go up.â Edw. Oh! Madam! hear me speak! Luc. Speak on, for that's the voice of my Accuser; The voice of Mortimer:âyet why speak on? I own thy charges, and prepare for Hell. Edw. Markâ Luc. That's wrong; I say there is no blame in Mark. Edw. Compose thyselfâif bliss be not our lot, We yet may calmly creep through this vile world. I'll snatch my Sister off this very night, And place her safely where she ne'er may know The horrors of her fate.âShe dreams not of them: And we shall well devise some artful tale, To hold her mind at rest. Luc. What's that my Edward? 'Tis something yet: it calls me to myself: I feel a gleam return for Magdeline. But howâ Edw. Our counsell'd plan is ripe already.â Now trust me, Madam, let us hope success. Luc. Oh! Edward! Edward! we may meet hereafterâ Go! take thy Sisterâthough I fear it muchâ But go and try. Edw. Wilt thou not go? Luc. Fatigue! That were alone sufficient to restrain meâ But oh! my Son! I feel another clog; A heavier chain; it is the hand of Death. Edw. Nay, talk not thus, my Mother! talk not thus. Luc. 'Tis more than Nature's self prescrib'd to matter, When she compounded it with animation. There's not a vein or fibre in my heart But what hath lost it's tone; and my poor brainâ The storm hath reach'd my brainâconfusion rollsâ Idea heaping fast upon idea Fall into masses of unshap'd conception, And make all horror bigâbigger than life.â Oh! while I have a ray of mem'ry left, My blessing take: Oh! bless thee! bless thee, Edward! Bless thee, my Mortimer! but haste, my Son! Lose not the moments that should save thy Sister; Fly to her redemption, Edward! and Heav'n, Heav'n bless thee! Yet remember, if thou can'st, If without danger, thou can'st come again To close thy wretched Mother's eyes, oh! come! Come and pray by me; weep upon my corpse, And though I have been guilty, shed a tear! Edw. Oh! Madam! strive to calmâ Luc. No, no, 'tis vain! But do not loiter Edward! While I live, Yield me the only comfort left my hope, To know my child hath fled the reach of knowledge.â Heav'n bless you both! (Embraces him. Edw. Yes! I will come again; Never will I forsake thee. Luc. Bless you both! (Exit Edward.âLucretia retires to the Couch, and the Scene closes. Enter Orlando and Claudio from the chamber. Orl. Claudio! go on, and see if all be clear. Claud. I cannot go alone. Orl. What fear'st thou, fool? Claud. Softly, my Lord! we're lostâhere's some one coming.â Orl. Go in, go in, haste, haste, go in. (They go in. Enter Edward and Mark, meeting. Mark. Edward! Edw. Mark! Mark. God save thee! Edw. God save thee, Mark! Mark. Heard you the thunder-clap, just when we parted? Edw. It shook the Castle walls; 'twas the last burst And clearing of the storm. Well, my good friend! How hast thou succeeded? Mark. To our best wishes.â The steeds are almost ready, and the groom Now waiting for us: the poor youth resolves To fly the Country, for he hates his Lord, And will not meet his rage. Edw. Most fortunate! Mark. Behold the Sword I promis'd to procure: Thou can'st not use it in a better cause. It was thy Father'sâbought 'mong other thingsâ I lov'd him much, and for his sake I kept The rust from feeding on the valu'd blade. Take it, I think thy cause too good to fail. Edw. Dear Blade! the cause is thine as well as Edward's. Oh! had thy valiant master had fair play, Thou had'st not been consign'd to this poor hand: Dear Blade! I am thy master's Son: be firm! Now leave me, Mark! but keep thyself prepar'd. Mark. I'll see the horses out, and give thee time To draw him hence, then back for Magdeline. Oh! may'st thou prosper! Edward. alone. Never doubt it Mark.â Omniscient Pow'r! thou know'st my inmost thoughts; The bottom of my heart is open to thee; If there are latent seeds of vices there, Forgive me, for the firm resolve thou see'st Ne'er basely to submit to Hellish Pow'rs: If thou dost see the justice of my cause, Then give me strength to foil this hell-born villain! But if I fail, oh! speed me to my Father! Enter Orlando. Orl. Still hereâI hope there's no suspicion stirring.â 'Tis the young stranger: what can bring him up? I must go out, to move him from this place.â (Comes forward, shutting the door after him. I'm sorry, Sir, to find your rest disturb'd. Edw. Look at me, Sir; look well: can'st thou not trace One feature of the injur'd Mortimer? Orl. Of Mortimer! all Nature arms against me. Edw. Yes, Lord! to thy confusion, Mortimer. Villain! the world shall not contain us both.â I have been told thou art profess'd in arms, E'en in the night I find thou wear'st thy sword; I do myself a little boast the science:â The moon's now bright, I'll take thee to a spot, Where we may pass some time in exercise. Orl. (aside). To raise the Castle now were sure detection.â (To Edward.) Rash youth! thou urgest instant deathâmy skillâ Come I will make amends.â Edw. Confusion seize thee! Orl. Now, thou shalt have thy Father's lands again.â Edw. Amends! and lands! consummate villain! lands! Now, wilt thou go, I say? Orl. We'll meet to-morrowâ From this I will not budge a foot to-nightâ Go to thy chamber nowâwe'll meet to-morrow. Edw. On both to-morrow's sun shall never shineâ Come forth, I say, adult'rous dastard villain! Orl. Boy-like rave on, I keep this door to-night. Edw. Then let me tell thee, I will ope that door.â (Draws, and throws away the scabbard. I'll have thy Daughter out, incestuous wretch! Thou know'st she is thy daughter: Devil! Devil! Orl. Then all is o'er, and I've but this to save me.â (Draws. Here's for thy heart.â Edw. And this for thineâcome on.â (They fight, and Orlando falls. Orl. Perdition! oh I'm lost! Edw. So, Heav'n be prais'd! Luc. (within). What sounds are these? I hear the clash of swords. Edw. My Mother's voice! Luc. Where is my wretched child? Enter Lucretia, Mark, and Servants with lights. Orl. Away! begone! oh take that spirit hence!â What! art thou come to lead me to my pit? Hast made it hot enough?âdamnation!âoh! (Dies. Luc. Edward! what hast thou done? oh murder! murder! Where is Orlando? tell me where he is? Hast thou secur'd thy Sister's passage? hast thou? No! then she shall go along with meâ Edw. Oh Madam! Luc. Danger! there is no danger in the voyage. Edw. Alas! alas! her senses are quite gone. Luc. I tell thee, Boy, thou should'st have had my daughter; But thou hast slain her Fatherâam I blind? Dost think I cannot see him lying there? Forget it, Boy! I'll marry her myself.â Dead! oh! (Goes to Orlando, raises his hand, screams, and faints. Edw. Mark! help me to support my Mother. Mark. Oh what a sight! Edw. A bitter sight to me. (Claudio comes out of the chamber. Mark. Claudio! Claud. Vouchsafe to hear a wretch with patience, Who comes to add fresh horror to the scene: A damned deed, and which I scarce can speak. 'Tis murderâfor my Lord hath stabb'd his Lady, And brought me to convey the body hence. Spare! spare my life! I knew not of the murder. Luc. Who knew not of the murder? who? what murder? Alas! my child! my child! my Magdeline!â I'll see if this be trueâ Edw. Thou must not go:â Go, Mark! while I do gently hold her here. (Exit Mark. Luc. Oh! let me see my child, and take one kiss! But one, for pity's sake! before I die: Hereafter I will do thee ev'ry serviceâ Do let meâ Edw. Oh! 'tis more than I can bear. Luc. Was she murder'd?âOh what a smile is that! Then Mortimer forgives, and thou my childâ What means that bloody stream adown thy breast?â Yes I am coming to youâshall we join?â The charges will go home.â Mark (returning). Oh Edward! Edward! (They whisper. Luc. So! so! while they contrive these worldly matters, I'll make the wretch secure, and bring him with me. (She goes to Orlando, stabs, and seizes the body. See there! I've got him fast: oh! help me, help! Edw. Oh my distracted Mother! Luc. Are ye going? Will ye not help me to secure him first? He struggles hardâI am not strong enough. (Quits hold of the body. There! there! he's gone! I told you he would slipâ Oh! do not goâbut take me, take me with you! My Mortimer! my Magdeline!âthis chain!â Orlando is in Hell; I heard him fall, And heard th' Infernals yell aloud their joyâ I mount, I come; now, now I break the chainâ 'Tis doneâI'm goneâEdward, awhile farewell! My soul perceives a balmy restoration, While Intellect increasing rushes on me: Atonement has been made, I rise refin'd, And now awake to everlasting bliss. (Dies. END OF THE TRAGEDY.</field>
