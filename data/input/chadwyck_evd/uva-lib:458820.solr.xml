      <field name="fulltext">THE SHOMAKERS Holiday, OR The Gentle Craft. With the humorous life of Simon Eyre, shoomaker, and Lord Maior of London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To all good Fellowes, Professors of the Gentle Craft; of what degree soeuer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Three-mans Song. O the month of Maie, the merrie month of Maie, So frolicke, so gay, and so greene, so greene, so greene: O and then did I, vnto my true loue say, Sweete Peg, thou shalt be my Summers Queene. Now the Nightingale, the prettie Nightingale, The sweetest singer in all the Forrests quier: Intreates thee sweete Peggie, to heare thy true loues tale, Loe, yonder she sitteth, her breast against a brier. But O I spie the Cuckoo, the Cuckoo, the Cuckoo, See where she sitteth, come away my ioy: Come away I prithee, I do not like the Cuckoo Should sing where my Peggie and I kisse and toy. O the month of Maie, the merrie month of Maie, So frolike, so gay, and so greene, so greene, so greene: And then did I, vnto my true loue say, Sweete Peg, thou shalt be my Summers Queene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The second Three-mans Song. This is to be sung at the latter end. Cold's the wind, and wet's the raine, Saint Hugh be our good speede: Ill is the weather that bringeth no gaine, Nor helpes good hearts in neede. Trowle the boll, the iolly Nut-browne boll, And here kind mate to thee: Let's sing a dirge for Saint Hughes soule, And downe it merrily. Downe a downe, hey downe a downe, Hey derie derie down a down, Close with the tenor boy: Ho well done, to me let come, Ring compasse gentle ioy. Trowle the boll, the Nut-browne boll, And here kind &amp;c. as often as there be men to drinke. At last when all haue drunke, this verse. Cold's the wind, and wet's the raine, Saint Hugh be our good speede: Ill is the weather that bringeth no gaine, Nor helpes good hearts in neede.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue as it was pronounced before the Queenes Maiestie. As wretches in a storme (expecting day) With trembling hands and eyes cast vp to heauen, Make Prayers the anchor of their conquerd hopes, So we (deere Goddesse) wonder of all eyes, Your meanest vassalls (through mistrust and feare, To sincke into the bottome of disgrace, By our imperfit pastimes) prostrate thus On bended knees, our sailes of hope do strike, Dreading the bitter stormes of your dislike. Since then (vnhappy men) our hap is such, That to our selues our selues no help can bring, But needes must perish, if your saint-like eares (Locking the temple where all mercy sits) Refuse the tribute of our begging tongues. Oh graunt (bright mirror of true Chastitie) From those life-breathing starres your sun-like eyes, One gratious smile: for your celestiall breath Must send vs life, or sentence vs to death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Lord Maior, Lincolne. Lincolne. My Lord Maior, you haue sundrie times Feasted my selfe, and many Courtiers more, Seldome, or neuer can we be so kind, To make requitall of your curtesie: But leauing this, I heare my cosen Lacie Is much affected to your daughter Rose. L. Maior. True my good Lord, and she loues him so wel, That I mislike her boldnesse in the chace. Lincol. Why my lord Maior, think you it then a shame, To ioyne a Lacie with an Otleys name? L. Maior. Too meane is my poore girle for his high birth, Poore Cittizens must not with Courtiers wed, Who will in silkes, and gay apparrell spend More in one yeare, then I am worth by farre, Therefore your honour neede not doubt my girle. Lincolne. Take heede my Lord, aduise you what you do, A verier vnthrift liues not in the world, Then is my cosen, for Ile tel you what, Tis now almost a yeare since he requested To trauell countries for experience, I furnisht him with coyne, billes of exchange, Letters of credite, men to waite on him, Solicited my friends in Italie Well to respect him: but to see the end: Scant had he iornied through halfe Germanie, But all his coyne was spent, his men cast off, His billes imbezeld, and my iolly coze, Asham'd to shew his bankerupt presence here, Became a Shoomaker in Wittenberg, A goodly science for a gentleman Of such discent: now iudge the rest by this. Suppose your daughter haue a thousand pound, He did consume me more in one halfe yeare, And make him heyre to all the wealth you haue, One twelue moneth's rioting wil waste it all, Then seeke (my Lord) some honest Cittizen To wed your daughter to. L. Maior. I thanke your Lordship, Wel Foxe, I vnderstand your subtiltie, As for your nephew, let your lordships eie But watch his actions, and you neede not feare, For I haue my daughter farre enough, And yet your cosen Rowland might do well Now he hath learn'd an occupation, And yet I scorne to call him sonne in law. Lincolne. I but I haue a better trade for him, I thanke his grace he hath appointed him, Chiefe colonell of all those companies Mustred in London, and the shires about, To serue his highnesse in those warres of France: See where he comes: Louel what newes with you? Enter Louell, Lacie, and Askew. Louell. My Lord of Lincolne, tis his highnesse will, That presently your cosen ship for France With all his powers, he would not for a million, But they should land at Deepe within foure daies. Linc. Goe certifie his grace it shall be done: Exit Louell. Now cosen Lacie, in what forwardnesse Are all your companies? Lacie. All wel prepar'd, The men of Hartfordshire lie at Mile end, Suffolke, and Essex, traine in Tuttle fields, The Londoners, and those of Middlesex, All gallantly prepar'd in Finsbury, With frolike spirits, long for their parting hower. L. Maior. They haue their imprest, coates, and furniture, And if it please your cosen Lacie come To the Guild Hall, he shall receiue his pay, And twentie pounds besides my brethren Will freely giue him, to approue our loues We beare vnto my Lord your vncle here. Lacie. I thanke your honour. Lincolne. Thankes my good Lord Maior. L. Ma. At the Guild Hal we wil expect your comming, Exit. Lincolne. To approue your loues to me? no subtiltie Nephew: that twentie pound he doth bestow, For ioy to rid you from his daughter Rose: But cosens both, now here are none but friends, I would not haue you cast an amorous eie Upon so meane a proiect, as the loue Of a gay wanton painted cittizen, I know this churle, euen in the height of scorne, Doth hate the mixture of his bloud with thine, I pray thee do thou so, remember coze, What honourable fortunes wayt on thee, Increase the kings loue which so brightly shines, And gilds thy hopes, I haue no heire but thee: And yet not thee, if with a wayward spirit, Thou start from the true byas of my loue. Lacie. My Lord, I will (for honor (not desire Of land or liuings) or to be your heire) So guide my actions in pursuit of France, As shall adde glorie to the Lacies name. Lincolne. Coze, for those words heres thirtie Portugues And Nephew Askew, there's a few for you, Faire Honour in her loftiest eminence Staies in France for you till you fetch her thence, Then Nephewes, clap swift wings on your dissignes, Be gone, be gone, make haste to the Guild Hall, There presently Ile meete you, do not stay, Where honour becomes, shame attends delay. Exit. Askew. How gladly would your vncle haue you gone? Lacie. True coze, but Ile ore-reach his policies, I haue some serious businesse for three dayes, Which nothing but my presence can dispatch, You therefore cosen with the companies Shall haste to Douer, there Ile meete with you, Or if I stay past my prefixed time, Away for France, weele meete in Normandie, The twentie pounds my Lord Maior giues to me You shall receiue, and these ten portugues, Part of mine vncles thirtie, gentle coze, Haue care to our great charge, I know your wisedome Hath tride it selfe in higher consequence. Askew. Coze, al my selfe am yours, yet haue this care, To lodge in London with al secresie, Our vncle Lincolne hath (besides his owne) Many a iealous eie, that in your face Stares onely to watch meanes for your disgrace. Lacie. Stay cosen, who be these? Enter Symon Eyre, his wife, Hodge, Firk, Iane, &amp; Rafe with a peece. Eyre. Leaue whining, leaue whining, away with this whimpring, this pewling, these blubbring teares, and these wet eies, Ile get thy husband discharg'd, I warrant thee sweete Iane: go to. Hodge. Master, here be the captaines. Eyre. Peace Hodge, husht ye knaue, husht. Firke. Here be the caualiers, and the coronels, maister. Eyre. Peace Firke, peace my fine Firke, stand by with your pishery pasherie, away, I am a man of the best presence, Ile speake to them and they were Popes, gentlemen, captaines, colonels, commanders: braue men, braue leaders, may it please you to giue me audience, I am Simon Eyre, the mad Shoomaker of Towerstreete, this wench with the mealy mouth that wil neuer tire, is my wife I can tel you, heres Hodge my man, and my foreman, heres Firke my fine firking iourneyman, and this is blubbered Iane, al we come to be suters for this honest Rafe keepe him at home, and as I am a true shoomaker, and a gentleman of the Gentle Craft, buy spurs your self, and Ile find ye bootes these seuen yeeres. Wife. Seuen yeares husband? Eyre. Peace Midriffe, peace, I know what I do, peace. Firk. Truly master cormorant, you shal do God good seruice to let Rafe and his wife stay together, shees a yong new married woman, if you take her husband away from her a night, you vndoo her, she may beg in the day time, for hees as good a workman at a pricke &amp; an awle, as any is in our trade. Iane. O let him stay, else I shal be vndone. Firke. I truly, she shal be laid atone side like a paire of old shooes else, and be occupied for no vse. Lacie. Truly my friends, it lies not in my power, The Londoners are prest, paide, and set forth By the Lord Maior, I cannot change a man. Hodge. Why then you were as good be a corporall, as a colonel, if you cannot discharge one good fellow, and I tell you true, I thinke you doe more then you can answere, to presse a man within a yeare and a day of his mariage. Eyre. Wel said melancholy Hodge, gramercy my fine foreman. Wife. Truly gentlemen, it were il done, for such as you, to stand so stiffely against a poore yong wife: considering her case, she is new married, but let that passe: I pray deale not roughly with her, her husband is a yong man and but newly entred, but let that passe. Eyre. Away with your pisherie pasherie, your pols and your edipolls, peace Midaffe, silence Cisly Bumtrincket, let your head speake. Firke. Yea and the hornes too, master. Eyre. Too soone, my fine Firk, too soone: peace scoundrels, see you this man? Captaines, you will not release him, wel let him go, hee's a proper shot, let him vanish, peace Iane, drie vp thy teares, theile make his powder dankish, take him braue men, Hector of Troy was an hackney to him, Hercules and Termagant scoundrelles, Prince Arthurs Round table, by the Lord of Ludgate, nere fed such a tall, such a dapper swordman: by the life of Pharo, a braue resolute swordman, peace Iane, I say no more, mad knaues. Firk. See, see Hodge, how my maister raues in commendation of Rafe. Hodge. Raph, thart a gull by this hand, and thou goest. Askew I am glad (good master Ayre) it is my hap To meete so resolute a souldiour. Trust me, for your report, and loue to him, A common slight regard shall not respect him. Lacie. Is thy name Raph? Raph. Yes sir. Lacie. Giue me thy hand, Thou shalt not want, as I am a gentleman: Woman, be patient, God (no doubt) wil send Thy husband safe againe, but he must go, His countries quarrel sayes, it shall be so. Hodge Thart a gull by my stirrop, if thou dost not goe, I wil not haue thee strike thy gimblet into these weake vessels, pricke thine enemies Rafe. Enter Dodger Dodger. My lord, your vncle on the Tower hill, Stayes with the lord Mayor, and the Aldermen, And doth request you with al speede you may To hasten thither. exit Dodger. Askew Cosin, lets go. Lacy Dodger, runne you before, tel them we come, This Dodger is mine vncles parasite, The arrantst varlet that e're breathd on earth, He sets more discord in a noble house, By one daies broching of his pickethanke tales, Then can be salu'd againe in twentie yeares, And he (I feare) shall go with vs to France, To prie into our actions. Askew. Therefore coze, It shall behooue you to be circumspect, Lacy. Feare not good cosen: Raph, hie to your colours. Raph. I must, because theres no remedie, But gentle maister and my louing dame, As you haue alwaies beene a friend to me, So in mine absence thinke vpon my wife. Iane. Alas my Raph. Wife.

Enter Rose alone making a Garland. Here sit thou downe vpon this flowry banke, And make a garland for thy Lacies head, These pinkes, these roses, and these violets, These blushing gilliflowers, these marigoldes, The faire embrodery of his coronet, Carry not halfe such beauty in their cheekes, As the sweete countnaunce of my Lacy doth. O my most vnkinde father! O my starres! Why lowrde you so at my natiuity, To make me loue, yet liue robd of my loue? Here as a theefe am I imprisoned (For my deere Lacies sake) within those walles, Which by my fathers cost were builded vp For better purposes: here must I languish For him that doth as much lament (I know) enter Sibil. Mine absence, as for him I pine in woe. Sibil Good morrow yong Mistris, I am sure you make that garland for me, against I shall be Lady of the Haruest. Rose Sibil, what news at London? Sibil None but good: my lord Mayor your father, and maister Philpot your vncle, and maister Scot your coosin, and mistris Frigbottom by Doctors Commons, doe all (by my troth) send you most hearty commendations. Rose Did Lacy send kind greetings to his loue? Sibil O yes, out of cry, by my troth, I scant knew him, here a wore scarffe, and here a scarfe, here a bunch of fethers, and here pretious stones and iewells, and a paire of garters: O monstrous! like one of our yellow silke curtains, at home here in Old-ford house, here in maister Bellymounts chamber, I stoode at our doore in Cornehill, lookt at him, he at me indeed, spake to him, but he not to me, not a word, mary gup thought I with a wanion, he passt by me as prowde, mary foh, are you growne humorous thought I? and so shut the doore, and in I came. Rose O Sibill, how dost thou my Lacy wrong? My Rowland is as gentle as a lambe, No doue was euer halfe so milde as he. Sibil Milde? yea, as a bushel of stampt crabs, he lookt vpon me as sowre as veriuice: goe thy wayes thought I, thou maist be much in my gaskins, but nothing in my neather-stockes: this is your fault mistris, to loue him that loues not you, he thinkes scorne to do as he's done to, but if I were as you, Ide cry, go by Ieronimo, go by, Ide set mine olde debts against my new driblets, and the hares foot against the goose giblets, for if euer I sigh when sleepe I shoulde take, pray God I may loose my mayden-head when I wake. Rose Will my loue leaue me then and go to France? Sibill I knowe not that, but I am sure I see him stalke before the souldiers, by my troth he is a propper man, but he is proper that proper doth, let him goe snicke-vp yong mistris. Rose Get thee to London, and learne perfectly, Whether my Lacy go to France, or no: Do this, and I wil giue thee for thy paines, My cambricke apron, and my romish gloues, My purple stockings, and a stomacher, Say, wilt thou do this Sibil for my sake? Sibil Wil I quoth a? at whose suite? by my troth yes, Ile go, a cambricke apron, gloues, a paire of purple stockings, and a stomacher, Ile sweat in purple mistris for you, ile take any thing that comes a Gods name, O rich, a Cambricke apron; faith then haue at vp tailes all, Ile go, Iiggy, Ioggy to London, and be here in a trice yong mistris. Exit. Rose. Do so good Sibill, meane time wretched I Will sit and sigh for his lost companie. Exit. Enter Rowland Lacy like a Dutch Shooe-maker. Lacy. How many shapes haue gods and Kings deuisde, Thereby to compasse their desired loues? It is no shame for Rowland Lacy then, To clothe his cunning with the Gentle Craft, That thus disguisde, I may vnknowne possesse, The onely happie presence of my Rose: For her haue I forsooke my charge in France, Incurd the Kings displeasure, and stir d vp Rough hatred in mine vncle Lincolnes brest: O loue, how powerfull art thou, that canst change High birth to barenesse, and a noble mind, To the meane semblance of a shooemaker? But thus it must be: for her cruell father, Hating the single vnion of our soules, Hath secretly conueyd my Rose from London, To barre me of her presence, but I trust Fortune and this disguise will furder me Once more to view her beautie, gaine her sight. Here in Towerstreete, with Ayre the shooe-maker, Meane I a while to worke, I know the trade, I learn't it when I was in Wittenberge: Then cheere thy hoping sprites, be not dismaide, Thou canst not want, do fortune what she can, The Gentle Craft is liuing for a man. exit.

My Lord I am aduis'd, That what I spake is true: to proue it so, His cosen Askew that supplide his place, Sent me for him from France, that secretly He might conuey himselfe hither. Lin. Ist euen so. Dares he so carelessely venture his life, Upon the indignation of a King? Hath he despis'd my loue, and spurn'd those fauours, Which I with prodigall hand powr'd on his head? He shall repent his rashnes with his soule, Since of my loue he makes no estimate, Ile make him wish he had not knowne my hate, Thou hast no other newes? Dodger. None else, my Lord. Lin. None worse I know thou hast: procure the king To crowne his giddie browes with ample honors, Send him cheefe Colonell, and all my hope Thus to be dasht? but tis in vaine to grieue, One euill cannot a worse releeue: Upon my life I haue found out his plot, That old dog Loue that fawnd vpon him so, Loue to that puling girle, his faire cheek't Rose, The Lord Maiors daughter hath distracted him, And in the fire of that loues lunacie, Hath he burnt vp himselfe, consum'd his credite, Lost the kings loue, yea and I feare, his life, Onely to get a wanton to his wife: Dodger, it is so.

Rose Can it be possible you loue me so? No, no, within those eie-bals I espie, Apparant likelihoods of flattery, Pray now let go my hand. Hammon. Sweete mistris Rose, Misconstrue not my words, nor misconceiue Of my affection, whose deuoted soule Sweares that I loue thee dearer then my heart. Rose. As deare as your owne heart? I iudge it right. Men loue their hearts best when th'are out of sight. Hamond. I loue you, by this hand. Rose. Yet hands off now: If flesh be fraile, how weake and frail's your vowe? Hamond. Then by my life I sweare. Rose. Then do not brawle, One quarrell looseth wife and life and all, Is not your meaning thus? Hamond. In faith you iest. Rose. Loue loues to sport, therfore leaue loue y'are best. L. Mai. What? square they maister Scot? Scot. Sir, neuer doubt, Louers are quickly in, and quickly out. Ham. Sweet Rose, be not so strange in fansying me, Nay neuer turne aside, shunne not my sight, I am not growne so fond, to fond my loue On any that shall quit it with disdaine, If you wil loue me, so, if not, farewell. L. Ma. Why how now louers, are you both agreede? Ham. Yes faith my Lord. L. Maior. Tis well, giue me your hand, giue me yours daughter. How now, both pull backe, what meanes this, girle? Rose. I meane to liue a maide. Ham. But not to die one, pawse ere that be said. aside. L. Mai. Wil you stil crosse me? still be obstinate? Hamond. Nay chide her not my Lord for doing well, If she can liue an happie virgins life, Tis farre more blessed then to be a wife. Rose. Say sir I cannot, I haue made a vow, Who euer be my husband, tis not you. L. Mai. Your tongue is quicke, but M. Hamond know, I bade you welcome to another end. Ham. What, would you haue me pule, &amp; pine, and pray, With louely ladie mistris of my heart, Pardon your seruant, and the rimer play, Rayling on Cupid, and his tyrants dart, Or shal I vndertake some martiall spoile, Wearing your gloue at turney, and at tilt, And tel how many gallauts I vnhorst, Sweete, wil this pleasure you? Rose. Yea, when wilt begin? What louerimes man? fie on that deadly sinne. L. Maior. If you wil haue her, Ile make her agree. Ham. Enforced loue is worse then hate to me, There is a wench keepes shop in the old change, To her wil I, it is not wealth I seeke, I haue enough, and wil preferre her loue Before the world: my good lord Maior adew, Old loue for me, I haue no lucke with new. Exit. L. Ma. Now mammet you haue wel behau'd your selfe, But you shal curse your coynes if I liue, Whose within there? see you conuay your mistris Straight to th'old Forde, Ile keepe you straight enough, Fore God I would haue sworne the puling girle, Would willingly accepted Hammons loue, But banish him my thoughts, go minion in, exit Rose. Now tel me master Scot would you haue thought, That master Simon Eyre the shoomaker, Had beene of wealth to buy such marchandize? Scot. Twas wel my Lord, your honour, and my selfe, Grew partners with him for your bils of lading, Shew that Eyres gaines in one commoditie, Rise at the least to ful three thousand pound, Besides like gaine in other marchandize. L. Maior. Wel he shal spend some of his thousands now For I haue sent for him to the Guild Hal, enter Eyre. See where he comes: good morrow master Eyre. Eyre. Poore Simon Eyre, my Lord, your shoomaker. L. Maior. Wel wel, it likes your selfe to terme you so, Now M. Dodger, whats the news with you? Enter Dodger. Dodger.

It may be, but vpon my faith and soule, I know not where he liues, or whether he liues, So tel my Lord of Lincolne, lurch in London?

Enter Iane in a Semsters shop working, and Hamond muffled at another doore, he stands aloofe. Hamond. Yonders the shop, and there my faire loue sits, Shees faire and louely, but she is not mine, O would she were, thrise haue I courted her, Thrise hath my hand beene moistned with her hand, Whilst my poore famisht eies do feed on that Which made them famish: I am infortunate, I stil loue one, yet no body loues me, I muse in other men what women see, That I so want? fine mistris Rose was coy, And this too curious, oh no, she is chaste, And for she thinkes me wanton, she denies To cheare my cold heart with her sunnie eies: How prettily she workes, oh prettie hand! Oh happie worke, it doth me good to stand Unseene to see her, thus I oft haue stood, In frostie euenings, a light burning by her, Enduring biting cold, only to eie her, One onely looke hath seem'd as rich to me As a kings crowne, such is loues lunacie: Muffeled Ile passe along, and by that trie Whether she know me. Iane. Sir, what ist you buy? What ist you lacke sir? callico, or lawne, Fine cambricke shirts, or bands, what will you buy? Ham. That which thou wilt not sell, faith yet Ile trie: How do you sell this handkercher? Iane. Good cheape. Ham. And how these ruffes? Iane. Cheape too. Ham. And how this band? Iane. Cheape too. Ham. All cheape, how sell you then this hand? Iane. My handes are not to be solde. Ham. To be giuen then: nay faith I come to buy. Iane. But none knowes when. Ham. Good sweete, leaue worke a little while, lets play. Iane. I cannot liue by keeping holliday. Ham. Ile pay you for the time which shall be lost. Iane. With me you shall not be at so much cost. Ham. Look how you wound this cloth, so you wound me. Iane. It may be so. Ham. Tis so. Iane. What remedie? Ham. Nay faith you are too coy. Iane. Let goe my hand. Ham. I will do any task at your command, I would let goe this beautie, were I not In mind to disobey you by a power That controlles kings: I loue you. Iane. So, now part. Ham. With hands I may, but neuer with my heart, In faith I loue you. Iane. I beleeue you doe. Ham. Shall a true loue in me breede hate in you? Iane. I hate you not. Ham. Then you must loue. Iane. I doe, what are you better now? I loue not you. Ham. All this I hope is but a womans fray, That means, come to me, when she cries, away: In earnest mistris I do not iest, A true chaste loue hath entred in my brest, I loue you dearely as I loue my life, I loue you as a husband loues a wife. That, and no other loue my loue requires, Thy wealth I know is little, my desires Thirst not for gold, sweete beauteous Iane whats mine, Shall (if thou make my selfe thine) all be thine, Say, iudge, what is thy sentence, life, or death? Mercie or crueltie lies in thy breath. Iane. Good sir, I do beleeue you loue me well: For tis a seely conquest, seely pride, For one like you (I meane a gentleman) To boast, that by his loue tricks he hath brought, Such and such women to his amorous lure: I thinke you do not so, yet many doe, And make it euen a very trade to wooe, I could be coy, as many women be, Feede you with sunne-shine smiles, and wanton lookes, But I detest witchcraft, say that I Doe constantly beleeue you, constant haue. Ham. Why dost thou not beleeue me? Iane. I beleeue you, But yet good sir, because I will not greeue you, With hopes to taste fruite, which will neuer fall, In simple truth this is the summe of all, My husband liues, at least I hope he liues, Prest was he to these bitter warres in France, Bitter they are to me by wanting him, I haue but one heart, and that hearts his due, How can I then bestow the same on you? Whilst he liues, his I liue, be it nere so poore, And rather be his wife, then a kings whore. Ham. Chaste and deare woman, I will not abuse thee, Although it cost my life, if thou refuse me, Thy husband prest for France, what was his name? Iane. Rafe Damport. Ham. Damport, heres a letter sent From France to me, from a deare friend of mine, A gentleman of place, here he doth write, Their names that haue bin slaine in euery fight. Iane. I hope deaths scroll containes not my loues name Ham. Cannot you reade? Iane. I can. Ham. Peruse the same, To my remembrance such a name I read Amongst the rest: see here. Iane. Aye me, hees dead: Hees dead, if this be true my deare hearts slaine. Ham. Haue patience, deare loue. Iane. Hence, hence. Ham. Nay sweete Iane, Make not poore sorrow prowd with these rich teares, I mourne thy husbands death because thou mournst. Iane. That bil is forgde, tis signde by forgerie. Ham. Ile bring thee letters sent besides to many Carrying the like report: Iane tis too true, Come, weepe not: mourning though it rise from loue Helpes not the mourned, yet hurtes them that mourne. Iane. For Gods sake leaue me. Ham. Whither dost thou turne? Forget the deede, loue them that are aliue, His loue is faded, trie how mine wil thriue. Iane. Tis now no time for me to thinke on loue, Ham. Tis now best time for you to thinke on loue, because your loue liues not. Iane. Thogh he be dead, my loue to him shal not be buried: For Gods sake leaue me to my selfe alone. Ham. T would kil my soule to leaue thee drownd in mone: Answere me to my sute, and I am gone, Say to me, yea, or no. Iane. No. Ham. Then farewell, one farewel wil not serue, I come again, come drie these wet cheekes, tel me faith sweete Iane, yea, or no, once more. Iane. Once more I say no, once more be gone I pray, else wil I goe. Ham. Nay then I wil grow rude by this white hand, Until you change that colde no, here ile stand, Til by your hard heart Iane. Nay, for Gods loue peace, My sorrowes by your presence more increase, Not that you thus are present, but al griefe Desires to be alone, therefore in briefe Thus much I say, and saying bid adew, If euer I wed man it shall be you. Ham. Oh blessed voyce, deare Iane Ile vrge no more, Thy breath hath made me rich. Iane. Death makes me poore. exeunt. Enter Hodge at his shop boord, Rafe, Firk, Hans, and a boy at work. All.

Firke, Hodge, lame Rafe, runne my tall men, beleager the shambles, beggar al East-Cheape, serue me whole oxen in chargers, and let sheepe whine vpon the tables like pigges for want of good felowes to eate them. Want meate! vanish Firke, auaunt Hodge. Hodge Your lordship mistakes my man Firke, he means their bellies want meate, not the boords, for they haue drunk so much they can eate nothing. Enter hans, Rose, and Wife. Wife Where is my Lord. Ayre How now lady Madgy. Wife The kings most excelent maiesty is new come, hee sends me for thy honor: one of his most worshipful Peeres, bade me tel thou must be mery, and so forth: but let that passe. Eyre Is my Soueraigne come? vanish my tall shoomakers, my nimble brethren, looke to my guests the prentises: yet stay a little, how now Hans, how lookes my little Rose? Hans Let me request you to remember me, I know your honour easily may obtaine, Free pardon of the king for me and Rose, And reconcile me to my vncles grace. Eyre Haue done my good Hans, my honest iorneyman, looke cheerely, Ile fall vpon both my knees till they be as hard as horne, but Ile get thy pardon. Wife Good my Lord haue a care what you speake to his grace. Eyre Away you Islington whitepot, hence you happerarse, you barly pudding ful of magots, you broyld carbonado, auaunt, auaunt, auoide Mephostophilus: shall Sim Eyre leaue to speake of you Ladie Madgie? vanish mother Miniuer cap, vanish, goe, trip and goe, meddle with your partlets, and your pishery pasherie, your flewes and your whirligigs, go, rub, out of mine alley: Sim Eyre knowes how to speake to a Pope, to Sultan Soliman, to Tamburlaine and he were here: and shal I melt? shal I droope before my Soueraigne? no, come my Ladie Madgie, follow me Hauns, about your businesse my frolicke free-booters: Firke, friske about, and about, and about, for the honour of mad Simon Eyre Lord Maior of London. Firke Hey for the honour of the shoomakers. exeunt. A long flourish or two: enter King, Nobles, Eyre, his wife, Lacie, Rose: Lacie and Rose kneele. King Well Lacie though the fact was verie foule, Of your reuolting from our kingly loue, And your owne duetie, yet we pardon you, Rise both, and mistris Lacie, thanke my Lord Maior For your yong bridegroome here. Eyre So my deere liege, Sim Eyre and my brethren the gentlemen shoomakers shal set your sweete maiesties image, cheeke by iowle by Saint Hugh, for this honour you haue done poore Simon Eyre. I beseech your grace pardon my rude behauiour, I am a handicrafts man, yet my heart is without craft, I would be sory at my soule, that my boldnesse should offend my king. King Nay, I pray thee good lord Maior, be euen as mery as if thou wert among thy shoomakers, It does me good to see thee in this humour. Eyre Saist thou me so my sweete Dioclesian? then hump, Prince am I none, yet am I princely borne, by the Lord of Ludgate my Liege, Ile be as merrie as a pie. King Tel me in faith mad Eyre, how old thou art. Eyre My Liege a verie boy, a stripling, a yonker, you see not a white haire on my head, not a gray in this beard, euerie haire I assure thy maiestie that stickes in this beard, Sim Eyre values at the king of Babilons ransome, Tama Chams beard was a rubbing brush toot: yet Ile shaue it off, and stuffe tennis balls with it to please my bully king. King But all this while I do not know your age. Eyre My liege, I am sixe and fiftie yeare olde, yet I can crie humpe, with a sound heart for the honour of Saint Hugh: marke this olde wench, my king, I dauncde the shaking of the sheetes with her sixe and thirtie yeares agoe, and yet I hope to get two or three yong Lorde Maiors ere I die: I am lustie still, Sim Eyre still: care, and colde lodging brings white haires. My sweete Maiestie, let care vanish, cast it vppon thy Nobles, it will make thee looke alwayes young like Apollo, and crye humpe: Prince am I none, yet am I princely borne. King Ha ha: saye Cornewall, didst thou euer see his like? Noble man Not I, my Lorde. Enter Lincolne, and Lord Maior. King Lincolne, what newes with you? Linc. My gracious Lord, haue care vnto your selfe, For there are traytors here. All Traytors, where? who? Eyre Traitors in my house? God forbid, where be my officers? Ile spend my soule ere my king feele harme. King Where is the traytor? Lincolne. Linc. Here he stands. King Cornewall, lay hold on Lacie: Lincolne, speake: What canst thou lay vnto thy Nephewes charge? Linc. This my deere liege: your grace to doe me honour, Heapt on the head of this degenerous boy, Desertlesse fauours, you made choise of him, To be commander ouer powers in France, But he. King Good Lincolne prythee pawse a while, Euen in thine eies I reade what thou wouldst speake, I know how Lacie did neglect our loue, Ranne himselfe deepely (in the highest degree) Into vile treason. Linc. Is he not a traytor? King Lincolne, he was: now haue we pardned him, Twas not a base want of true valors fire, That held him out of France, but loues desire. Linc. I wil not beare his shame vpon my backe. King Nor shalt thou Lincolne, I forgiue you both. Lin Then (good my liege) forbid the boy to wed One, whose meane birth will much disgrace his bed. King Are they not married? Linc. No my Liege. Both We are. King Shall I diuorce them then? O be it farre, That any hand on earth should dare vntie, The sacred knot knit by Gods maiestie, I would not for my crowne disioyne their hands, That are conioynd in holy nuptiall bands, How saist thou Lacy? wouldst thou loose thy Rose? Hans Not for all Indians wealth, my soueraigne. King But Rose I am sure her Lacie would forgoe. Rose If Rose were askt that question, sheed say, no. King You heare them Lincolne. Linc Yea my liege, I do. King Yet canst thou find ith heart to part these two? Who seeks, besides you, to diuorce these louers? L. Ma. I do (my gracious Lord) I am her father. King Sir Roger Oteley, our last Maior I thinke, Nob The same my liege. King Would you offend Loues lawes? Wel, you shal haue your wills, you sue to me, To prohibite the match: Soft, let me see, You both are married, Lacie, art thou not? Hans I am, dread Soueraigne. King Then vpon thy life, I charge thee, not to call this woman wife. L. Ma. I thanke your grace. Rose O my most gratious Lord! kneele King Nay Rose, neuer wooe me, I tel you true, Although as yet I am a batchellor, Yet I beleeue I shal not marry you. Rose Can you diuide the body from the soule, Yet make the body liue? King Yea, so profound? I cannot Rose, but you I must diuide: Faire maide, this bridegroome cannot be your bride. Are you pleasde Lincolne? Oteley, are you pleasde? Both Yes my Lord. King Then must my heart be easde, For credit me, my conscience liues in paine, Til these whom I deuorcde be ioynd againe: Lacy, giue me thy hand, Rose, lend me thine. Be what you would be: kisse now: so, thats fine, At night (louers) to bed: now let me see, Which of you all mislikes this harmony? L. Ma. Wil you then take from me my child perforce? King Why tell me Oteley, shines not Lacies name, As bright in the worldes eye, as the gay beames Of any citizen? Linc. Yea but my gratious Lord, I do mislike the match farre more than he, Her bloud is too too base. King Lincolne, no more, Dost thou not know, that loue respects no bloud? Cares not for difference of birth, or state, The maide is yong, wel borne, faire, vertuous, A worthy bride for any gentleman: Besides, your nephew for her sake did stoope To bare necessitie: and as I heare, Forgetting honors, and all courtly pleasures, To gaine her loue, became a shooemaker. As for the honor which he lost in France, Thus I redeeme it: Lacie, kneele thee downe, Arise sir Rowland Lacie: tell me now, Tell me in earnest Oteley, canst thou chide? Seeing thy Rose a ladie and a bryde. Lord Maior. I am content with what your Grace hath done. Linc. And I my liege, since theres no remedie. King Come on then, al shake hands, Ile haue you frends, Where there is much loue, all discord ends, What sayes my mad Lord Maior to all this loue? Eyre O my liege, this honour you haue done to my fine iourneyman here, Rowland Lacie, and all these fauours which you haue showne to me this daye in my poore house, will make Simon Eyre liue longer by one dozen of warme summers more then he should. King Nay, my mad Lord Maior (that shall be thy name) If any grace of mine can length thy life, One honour more Ile doe thee, that new building, Which at thy cost in Cornehill is erected, Shall take a name from vs, weele haue it cald, The Leaden hall, because in digging it, You found the lead that couereth the same. Eyre I thanke your Maiestie. Wife God blesse your Grace. King Lincolne, a word with you. Enter Hodge, Firke, Rafe, and more shoomakers. Eyre How now my mad knaues? Peace, speake softly, yonder is the king. King With the olde troupe which there we keepe in pay, We wil incorporate a new supply: Before one summer more passe ore my head, France shal repent England was iniured. What are all those? Hans All shoomakers, my Liege, Sometimes my fellowes, in their companies I liude as merry as an empror. King My mad lord Mayor, are all these shoomakers? Eyre All Shooemakers, my Liege, all gentlemen of the Gentle Craft, true Troians, couragious Cordwainers, they all kneele to the shrine of holy saint Hugh. All God saue your maiesty all shoomaker. King Mad Simon, would they any thing with vs? Eyre Mum mad knaues, not a word, Ile doot, I warrant you. They are all beggars, my Liege, all for themselues: and I for them all, on both my knees do intreate, that for the honor of poore Simon Eyre, and the good of his brethren these mad knaues, your Grace would vouchsafe some priuilege to my new Leden hall, that it may be lawfull for vs to buy and sell leather there two dayes a weeke. King Mad Sim, I grant your suite, you shall haue patent To hold two market dayes in Leden hall, Mondayes and Fridayes, those shal be the times: Will this content you? All Iesus blesse your Grace. Eyre In the name of these my poore brethren shoomakers, I most humbly thanke your Grace. But before I rise, seeing you are in the Giuing vaine, and we in the Begging, graunt Sim Eyre one boone more. King What is it my Lord Maior? Eyre Uouchsafe to taste of a poore banquet that standes sweetely waiting for your sweete presence. King I shall vndo thee Eyre, only with feasts, Already haue I beene too troublesome, Say, haue I not? Eyre O my deere king, Sim Eyre was taken vnawares vpon a day of shrouing which I promist long ago to the prentises of London: for andt please your Highnes, in time past I bare the water tankerd and my coate Sits not a whit the worse upon my backe: And then vpon a morning some mad boyes, It was Shrouetuesday eeune as tis now, Gaue me my breakefast, and I swore then by the stopple of my tankerd, if euer I came to be Lord Maior of London, I would feast al the prentises. This day (my liege) I did it, and the slaues had an hundred tables fiue times couered, they are gone home and vanisht: yet adde more honour to the Gentle Trade, taste of Eyres banquet, Simon's happie made. King Eyre, I wil taste of thy banquet, and wil say, I haue not met more pleasure on a day, Friends of the Gentle Craft, thankes to you al, Thankes my kind Ladie Mairesse for our cheere, Come Lordes, a while lets reuel it at home, When all our sports, and banquetings are done, Warres must right wrongs which Frenchmen haue begun. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
