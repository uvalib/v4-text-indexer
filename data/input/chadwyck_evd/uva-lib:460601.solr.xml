      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MARQUIS of ABERCORNE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. Ægisthus King of Argos. Orestes. Pylades. Arcas Governor of Orestes. Calchas Prophet and Priest of Jupiter. Nireus ancient domestic of Agamemnon. Phanor an Officer belonging to Ægisthus. Guards, &amp;c. Clytemnestra. Electra. Phedra Attendant on Clytemnestra.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE—Argos.Time—that of representation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE 1st. —The Temple of Jupiter. CALCHAS at the Altar. Hear Jove supreme! Thou! who, o'er all in highest heav'n enthron'd, Look'st on the frail inhabitants of earth, Oh hear my prayer! let not the sun, new ris'n On this dread day, unconscious of thy pow'r Withdraw its beams—bid Argos own thy might; While thou, in visitation of thy wrath, On the polluted feast of lust and murther Shalt loose the impatient thunder! NIREUS enters. Calchas, hail! CALCHAS. What brings thee hither? NIREUS. Clytemnestra's will. This day, when yearly rites, that mock the heav'ns, Bid Argos solemnize the blood-stain'd nuptials, Fear harrows up her soul. CALCHAS to himself. Their doom is fixt. Not vain at dawn the omen. NIREUS. Clytemnestra Now bids thee to the palace. CALCHAS. What, once more To hear in insolence of pride, Ægisthus Defy the vengeance of long-lingering Jove, And taunt his holy priest! Yes—I will go: If Jove confirm the omen—I will go: But not to sooth her terror. Yet, say first Of wrong'd Electra. NIREUS. On this day's return, Not only, as of old, Ægisthus binds Her limbs with chains, and in the cavern's gloom Bids her, unheard, rave on her long-lost brother, Th'avenger, lorn Orestes— CALCHAS —(interrupting him.) Hear, hear heav'n! NIREUS. But ere the sun go down, his vow is past To join by force the daughter of Atrides With one low-born: that never heir arise To claim the crown of Argos, or avenge Her murther'd sire. CALCHAS. The measure is complete. 'Tis doom'd above, the impious are no more. I will consult the God—Nireus retire— Exeunt. SCENE 2nd —An apartment in the palace. Ægisthus—Clytemnestra. ÆGISTHUS. Scorn Clytemnestra these unwonted fears: Prepare to grace the triumph. CLYTEMNESTRA. No Ægisthus— Not oracles, nor voice of answering shrine, Signs from the flight of bird, or bleeding victim, So mark impending doom, as this night-vision, The harbinger of vengeance. ÆGISTHUS. Clytemnestra, Shall idle terrors, shadows of a dream Subdue thy daring spirit? these are mock'ries That dotage dwells on, or the senseless fears Of credulous childhood— CLYTEMNESTRA —(interrupting him.) Hear me— ÆGISTHUS. I have seen thee Mid the fierce clamours of the madd'ning tumult Stand with undaunted brow. CLYTEMNESTRA. Thou hast beheld me Stain'd with the blood of man, a warrior's blood. The woman stood before astonish'd Argos, Her dagger dropping gore—I dread none earthly. This supernatural sight o'er-powers my soul. Look here—while Clytemnestra shakes before thee, Hast thou no fear? ÆGISTHUS. None from the dreams of night. While yet Orestes liv'd— CLYTEMNESTRA —(interrupting him.) Is he too murther'd? ÆGISTHUS. If gold can bribe, Orestes is no more— Why droops thy brow? his father's spirit fir'd him: His hate pursu'd, his vengeful blade hung o'er us. Speak I ungrateful words, thy son is dead? CLYTEMNESTRA. Thou never hadst a child— ÆGISTHUS. Mourn not his loss. CLYTEMNESTRA. Here, at this breast he hung. Messenger enters. Dread Lord, the pomp Waits but thy presence— ÆGISTHUS. Go—bid sorth my train. Come Clytemnestra, rob'd in Troy's proud spoils Grace, as of old, the triumph. CLYTEMNESTRA. No—Ægisthus— The horror, that o'er-pow'rs me, on my brow Deep stamps its visible impress—let the base Conceal their fear: such as I am behold me— I know not female artifice that lends The lip of misery a dissembling smile. No robe of Phrygian state shall blaze on me, No banquet hail my presence— ÆGISTHUS. Have I wrong'd thee? Dost thou repent the deed that joins our doom? CLYTEMNESTRA. Were it again to act, again this hand Would slay the man who wrong'd me—thee, Ægisthus, I still have faithful found. Whate'er the doom That Jove decrees, tho' thunder burst around me, Thee I will ne'er desert. ÆGISTHUS. I know thee now. CLYTEMNESTRA. Go, glitter in thy splendor. Yet—I pray thee— Yet—nay I charge thee, that no word, no look, No, not a silent smile betray contempt. I brook not insult, less from thee than all— Beware— ÆGISTHUS. Why this to me? speak— CLYTEMNESTRA. When the spectre Glar'd on me as I shriek'd—thou—dost not heed me. 'Tis man thou fear'st—hast thou no other fear? ÆGISTHUS. Say on— CLYTEMNESTRA. I breath'd aloud a vow to heav'n— Confirm it— ÆGISTHUS. Can I aid thee? CLYTEMNESTRA. Bid Electra On Agamemnon's sepulchre, complete The funeral rites! We reckt not of the dead. Th'accepted offerings haply may appease The avenging spirit—from this blood-stain'd hand Such rites were profanation. ÆGISTHUS. But Electra Now groans in chains, and, ere the night-fall, forc'd To hateful nuptials, vents her idle rage Beneath a servile roof. CLYTEMNESTRA. Free her from chains. Urge not the unequal tye. I have but her. Yet, if regardless of a mother's will That daughter mock my fear, fix thou her doom, E'en what thou wilt, so I no more behold her. Her voice has terror in it: and her eye In awful silence fixt on mine, exerts Strange mastery o'er my spirit— Messenger enters. Calchas comes. CLYTEMNESTRA. Say thou consent'st— ÆGISTHUS. In all be thou obey'd. CLYTEMNESTRA. Avoid the indignant prophet. (Ægisthus exit, as Calchas enters.) Holy Seer! Accept thy Sovereign's thanks, that thou, long time A stranger to this palace, once again, At Clytemnestra's call, hast deigned to hear What weighs upon her heart— CALCHAS —(interrupting her.) No thanks, for this, To me are due—ere my reluctant step Past o'er thy threshold, the inspected victim Gave sign; alone that signal I obey'd— CLYTEMNESTRA. Jove-honor'd prophet! super-natural horrors Mark me the victim of heav'n's imminent wrath. CALCHAS —(pointing up.) There justice reigns—thou shalt not scape thy doom. CLYTEMNESTRA. Thy prescience, Seer, can all unfold: thy pray'rs Wing'd intercessors at the throne of Jove Avert impending destiny, and turn The thunder in its course. CALCHAS. Here prayer avails not. When impious mortals tremble at their doom, Alone repentance at the throne of Jove Pleads, and is heard—Repent! CLYTEMNESTRA. Not—not for this I call'd thee. Priest! thy office hallows thee: Or, ere this hour, the tongue that rudely taunts Its sovereign, had been mute. (Calchas going in anger, she stops him.) Stay— CALCHAS. Impious mortal! I leave thee to thy fate— CLYTEMNESTRA —(detaining him.) Not unrevealed— Or shield me from these horrors, or unfold Clearly the dread unknown; that now my soul May summon all its strength to meet heav'n's wrath. Interpreter of fate wilt thou reveal it? CALCHAS. I speak but what Jove dictates—thou, be brief— CLYTEMNESTRA. Calchas, thou know'st, this day, ten years gone by, The son of Atreus perish'd— CALCHAS. Slain by thee— CLYTEMNESTRA. Aye—I deny it not— CALCHAS. 'Tis known to all. CLYTEMNESTRA. Well then—I slew him—ever on this day We hold a solemn festival at Argos, In honor of my nuptials with Ægisthus: Add—if thou wilt—of triumph o'er the slain. This too is known to all—but 'tis not known, That ever duly on this day's return, E'en at the very instant, at the dead Of midnight, when I smote him, a deep groan, Such as he utter'd when he fell beneath me, Bursts on my ear: and one, who cries “revenge,” Floats by; a shapeless figure indistinct: For I have gaz'd on't with unaltered eye, 'Till the dim shadow floated from my sight. Last night the groan was heard, the voice was heard Of one who cry'd “revenge:”—the shadow floated: But, gradually the uncertain shape assum'd The form of Agamemnon, mail'd in arms, Such as he stands, terrific on his tomb. CALCHAS. Didst thou then gaze with an unalter'd eye? CLYTEMNESTRA. No—'twas himself—I could not gaze on him. But, ere I turn'd, I saw the wound I made: And thro' the steel forth gush'd the blood: he caught it, And from the hollow of his hand pour'd forth An offering to the Furies: then drew near And cast the dregs on me. CALCHAS. That was no phantom. CLYTEMNESTRA. 'Twas fresh, 'twas living blood, 'twas warm to sense, Such as it spouted on me when I smote him. I turn'd aside, but still before my sight Which way my scar'd eye glanc'd, arm'd Furies stood. The viper brood that round their tresses tangled Their scaly coils, turn'd all their stings on me. On me, each bickering eye, that roll'd in blood, Shot sparks of fire. A voice of thunder burst, “Thus, will we lap thy blood”—“the dead shall slay thee”— I shriek'd: in rush'd the attendants. All was void— But they too heard the iron of their feet That echoed on the pavement: they beheld The flames in trailing flakes along the gloom— Say! how shall I appease th'avenging Furies? CALCHAS. By offerings suited to their ruthless nature. CLYTEMNESTRA. Prophet! explain those words—“the dead shall slay thee.” CALCHAS —(aside) Aid me, inspiring Jove! CLYTEMNESTRA. Wilt thou not answer? CALCHAS. In silence hear the pow'r, who guides my voice.— CLYTEMNESTRA. Oh speak!— CALCHAS. This day, a stranger youth, heav'n-sent, To Argos bears Orestes' funeral urn.— He can unfold the mystery of fate.— CLYTEMNESTRA. Would he were come! CALCHAS. He comes—obey the God— Thou, and Ægisthus, to the secret bath Where Agamemnon perish'd, lead the stranger; There, force him to reveal, howe'er reluctant, What Phœbus has imparted—bid Electra On Agamemnon's tomb libations pour. CLYTEMNESTRA. Where bled Atrides? said'st thou—in the bath— Not there—not there—I pray thee.— CALCHAS. On that spot Question the stranger youth: and, if averse Force him to speak.— CLYTEMNESTRA. I thank thee, Seer! farewell.—(Exeunt. (as they go out, Ægisthus and Phanor enter.) PHANOR. Electra doth refuse— ÆGISTHUS. Refuse, to quit The gloomy cell! PHANOR. “No earthly pow'r, this day, “Shall force me to behold the light I loath.”— Such were her words.— ÆGISTHUS. Bid her expect my presence. (Phanor goes.) Oft, proud Electra, hast thou vainly sought To bear thy offerings to Atrides' tomb. If proffer'd, thou reject it, never more Thy voice, domestic fiend, shall threat Ægisthus. (Exit. SCENE 3rd. —A Prison. Electra.—Phanor enters. PHANOR. Ægisthus comes. ELECTRA. Is there yet more to bear? ÆGISTHUS enters. Go, Phanor— ELECTRA. No—be present—stir not hence— With him I hold not secret conference.— ÆGISTHUS. Yield not to vain suspicions—if thou wilt, Detain him—bid him strictly note each word, Record each look—Yet, were no witness near, Woman, the weakness of thy sex protects thee. Thou hast no cause for fear.— ELECTRA. Phanor, retire.—(he goes). We dread not whom we scorn—speak, I am mute. ÆGISTHUS. I would that we had met in fitter place! ELECTRA. It suits a sufferer that delights in grief: It suits an outrag'd soul that broods on vengeance: It suits the day, the deed, thee most, base murderer! Look on these chains: think on the groans of death That echoed through these vaults. ÆGISTHUS. I come to grant What thou hast oft implor'd. ELECTRA. I oft have claim'd Rights still deny'd: the melancholy right To shed a tear on the unhonour'd tomb Of him whom thou did'st slay—I ne'er implor'd thee. ÆGISTHUS. 'Twere well that thou had'st sued—time was, Electra, That I with gifts and proffer'd kindness sought To sooth thy haughty spirit. ELECTRA. Gifts! to me! Tyrant! thou speak'st to Agamemnon's daughter! No bribe can lure the lion race to fawn— ÆGISTHUS. Therefore the lion race is gall'd with chains. ELECTRA —(with vehement indignation.) Where art thou, brother?—I had hope in thee— The sun keeps on his course, and the firm earth Rests on its base—Yet Jove holds sway in heav'n.— ÆGISTHUS. I come to free thee from these slavish chains: Free thee from nuptials that disgrace thy birth, And bid thee offer at a father's tomb The long-neglected rites.— ELECTRA. Thou mock'st me, tyrant— ÆGISTHUS. I loose thy chains.— ELECTRA. No—not a link shall fall.— These bonds are precious to me—time shall come When such may chain thee where the Furies close Their adamantine rivets.— ÆGISTHUS. Dost thou wish To honor Agamemnon? ELECTRA. More than life— If life the sacrifice, my father! hear me! For thee, another daughter gladly dies. Iphigenia bleeds again in me. ÆGISTHUS. Go forth, and place on Agamemnon's tomb Thy mother's offerings. ELECTRA. Said I not, thou mock'st me?— ÆGISTHUS. I mock thee not. 'Tis Clytemnestra's will. ELECTRA. Her will! aid, heav'n! repentance yet may touch her! Yes. I will bear the offerings. Lead me to her. (Exeunt. End of ACT 1st.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —A Street within the Walls of Argos. Orestes bearing an Urn.—Pylades, Arcas. ARCAS. Brave youths! by friendship join'd, and now by fate In common danger yok'd, here safely rest. None know you here. I, in strange garb disguis'd, Long absent from these walls, will venture on, And timely caution give.— PYLADES. (pointing to Orestes.) How deep his groan! Grief, like the mildew on the bloom of spring, Preys on his faded prime. Oh soothe his soul! ARCAS —(to Orestes.) The oracle of Phœbus shall not fail. Soon will your mission cease. ORESTES. Oh! PYLADES. Why that groan? ARCAS. He droops o'er-wearied—rest—behold the goal— These are the walls of Argos. There, the palace Tow'rs proudly eminent. ORESTES. Oh! PYLADES. Droop not, brother. ARCAS. Thou! whom these arms receiv'd, e'en from the cradle, When sad Electra rescued thee from death, Orestes! firmly execute thy charge. Thou, Pylades! watch o'er him. Rouse his soul By words that fire the hero. Here remain— I will not long be absent. (Exit. PYLADES. Lean on me. Friend of my soul! thou more than brother, come, Lean on this faithful breast!—tho' long the way, And rough the mountain tract, I oft have seen thee From dawn to night-fall urge the brindled wolf, And laugh to scorn the partners of the chase, That fainted in the noon-beam—silent—still— Think on the race when you outstript the Phocian Nam'd from his speed, the Brother of the wind.— ORESTES —(to himself.) These are the walls of Argos. PYLADES. Look upon me— Hast thou forgôt, when thou a boy didst wield The cœstus weight, and level'd at a blow Polydamas, who proud of giant size, Unrival'd, buffeted in sport the wind? ORESTES —(to himself.) There tow'rs the palace, proudly eminent.— PYLADES. Alas! the themes once wont to please, avail not! ORESTES. Oh dire disgrace! that Agamemnon's son Should thus approach the palace of his fathers! Thus lone, disguis'd, and stranger to his kin, The midnight plunderer in the gloom that shrouds him, Starts, as he falters on—Oh! Pylades! We, in the light of day, 'mid wondering throngs, When every eye gaz'd on us, oft have vow'd To rush where glory summon'd us, tho' death Stood at the goal, and held the wreath to crown us. But—now— PYLADES. Thou must obey th'inspiring God. By artifice, not force ensure success— Rouse from despair—revenge thy father's death! ORESTES. By any deed but this—a mother's murther! ARCAS enters. Brave youths! go boldly on—the palace gates Are left without a guard: and Clytemnestra, (So rumour speaks) lone broods o'er boding fears. ORESTES —(with horror.) Not that the place—not this th'appointed hour— At midnight—in the bath—where fell my father— Not in obscure response Apollo spoke. ARCAS. First Orestes Bear the feign'd tale to Clytemnestra's ear. That done, on Agamemnon's tomb complete The funeral rites. There claim th'appointed signal. On that thy doom depends: on that, the faith Due to the Delphic shrine. Thy father's image Shall, as instinct with life, thrice wave his lance; Or we are made the mockery of vain words, And murder stalks unpunish'd— (A festive chorus in the procession of Ægisthus is heard.) Hark! that sound As of some festive choir! PHANOR —(with some of Ægisthus's guards enters.) What may this mean? Why bends that mourner o'er the funeral urn? Nought of disastrous portent on this day Shall cloud rejoicing Argos—Hence!—(to Orestes.) ORESTES. Beware— ARCAS. Touch not that youth—we mean not to offend— PHANOR. Hence! PYLADES. Say, ere we depart, why rings the shout Of joy and choral song? PHANOR. 'Tis Argos' feast, Her annual feast: when every slave, and captive Free as his lord, the common banquet shares. PYLADES. What cause thus consecrates a nation's joy? PHANOR. Ægisthus's nuptials! ORESTES. (who, till now, had appear'd regardless of their discourse, bursts forward.) Slave! 'tis false. PYLADES. Oh heed not— Grief for the dead distracts him. PHANOR. On I haste To join the pomp. Away, nor linger here, Sullying with ill-tim'd gloom the general joy. (Exit. ORESTES —drawing a dagger. Come Pylades—he dies—a lion's nerve Strengthens my sinews. ARCAS. Stay rash youth! you rush On self-destruction—Guards and thronging crouds Compass him round.— ORESTES. Nor guards, nor throngs avail, When vengeance strikes the blow by justice doom'd, It strikes like heav'ns wing'd bolt: earth quakes beneath it, And all that live fly from the prostrate victim. I will not be restrain'd—come— ARCAS. Pylades! If thou regard his life, oh hold, detain him! (the chorus is again heard.) ORESTES. That shout again! I will not be controul'd! Oh may it rouse the thunder that but sleeps At Jove's right hand!—Away— PYLADES. (restraining him.) Orestes—friend! ORESTES. Ha! PYLADES. Hear me! ORESTES. Any pray'r—but that—but that— Thou sway'st at will each impulse of my soul.— PYLADES. My brother! ORESTES. Do not, I beseech thee, urge Thy influence o'er me—heard'st thou? 'tis his feast! Base Argos revels for Ægisthus' nuptials! It is Ægisthus, not a mother's breast I haste to pierce.— PYLADES. The oracle decreed Art should prevail, not force. ORESTES —(his hand on his breast.) Here—here it speaks— I want no other oracle. Stay thou— Jove! let me strike him dead! I ask not life. Farewell.— (as he rushes out, Pylades embraces him.) PYLADES. We die together.— ORESTES. Stay, my brother! PYLADES. Lead on! ORESTES. But—they will slay—thee— PYLADES. Boldly go.— ORESTES. Mould, mould me at thy will—what shall I do? PYLADES. Swear, if thou meet the tyrant in mid triumph, Thou wilt not strike him ere th'appointed time. ORESTES. An oath! to thee!—my friend! take my pledg'd hand. ARCAS. Oh virtuous youths! great Jove! in safety guide you. (Exeunt. SCENE 2d. —The great Square. The triumphal procession of Ægisthus.—He, in a car, adorn'd with garlands, drawn by four horses.—Music, Choral Hymn, Guards, People shouting. Arcas, Orestes, Pylades, crossing the stage. ARCAS. I pray you, pass this way—avoid the press. ORESTES. E'en where thou wilt. PHANOR —seeing them. Unmanner'd stranger! hence— Bear off that funeral urn.— ORESTES. Let me pass on.— PHANOR. Guards! force him from the place— ÆGISTHUS. What means this tumult? PHANOR. Look not this way—oh King! some men, obscure, Strangers, it seems, to Argos— ÆGISTHUS. Ha! an urn Crossing our pomp! reveal your name, your country. What here your purpose?—speak— ORESTES. Our country, Phocis: Of race unknown to same. ÆGISTHUS. Whose ashes, Phocians Rest in that urn?— ORESTES. —We bear to Clytemnestra— ÆGISTHUS —(interrupting him.) The ashes of Orestes?— ORESTES. —in this urn— ÆGISTHUS —(descending from his car.) Thrice welcome! strangers! share our joyful feast— Not unrewarded you return from Argos.— Give him that royal robe.— ORESTES. We seek no gifts— We may not share the banquet—look on this. (the urn). From Strophius we are come—the Lord of Phocis— By whose command we bear the last remains Of him that was Orestes—When he fell Before the Altar of the Delphian God Slain by an Argive,— ÆGISTHUS. —Cease—we reck not this— ORESTES. King! it imports thee much—When slander strikes The fetter'd slave, he, bold in innocence, Confronts the base accuser, and asserts The dignity of virtue! hear, Ægisthus! Orestes slew the wretch who pierc'd his breast; And the Assassin with his dying breath, Pronounced— PYLADES —(endeavouring to silence him.) Peace, Brother! ORESTES —(not regarding him.) —That Ægisthus sent him! ÆGISTHUS —(after a long pause.) That urn, thou say'st, contains Orestes' ashes: Why hither brought?—Phocis knows funeral rites. ORESTES. May not the ashes of a son repose Where sleeps his sire?—May not one kindred tear Be shed upon his urn, who never knew In life the blessing of a kindred smile? ÆGISTHUS. Electra lives—a mother's tear, no doubt— ORESTES. —(aside.) A mother!— ÆGISTHUS. —Go—to Clytemnestra bear The ashes of her son— (to his guards).—Ye—safely guard him.— (Exeunt. SCENE 3d. —An Apartment in the Palace. Clytemnestra, Phedra. PHEDRA. Vainly I urg'd—Electra still refuses, (No cause assign'd) from other hand than thine To take the funeral offerings—Lo! the bowl— And this the consecrated hair you sent—(presents them.) CLYTEMNESTRA. No other hand but hers, may bear the gift: None left save her alone. 'Twas Calchas spoke it: I may not disobey—conduct her hither—(Phedra goes.) Omit whate'er these Prophets have enjoin'd, All fails, and we, forewarn'd, provoke our doom. Electra, and Phedra enter. CLYTEMNESTRA —(to Electra.) Thou hast refus'd to bear my funeral offerings! ELECTRA. I dar'd not place them on my father's tomb, 'Till I had commun'd with thee— CLYTEMNESTRA. Say—what cause?— ELECTRA. What cause? And dost thou ask? And shall I speak it. CLYTEMNESTRA. Haply thou deem'dst it base, beneath thy birth, To take these gifts from other hands than mine? ELECTRA. I long have suffer'd base indignities— Lo these— (her chains.) CLYTEMNESTRA. I bad Ægisthus free thee. ELECTRA. Yes, He proffer'd—I refus'd— CLYTEMNESTRA. Yet, in that guise, Offerings were insult— ELECTRA. No—not that the insult— This, this is profanation, when the woman Who slew her husband, mocks his tomb with gifts. CLYTEMNESTRA. Daughter—! ELECTRA. Oh would that I could answer—Mother! CLYTEMNESTRA. My soul is overcharged with horror. Spare me— ELECTRA. Therefore I came. 'Tis now the suited time When words may pierce the soul. Oh! had I found thee A thoughtless reveller, rob'd in nuptial pomp, And smiling at the thron'd adulterer's side, I never had addrest thee—now I view thee Clad in the garb of woe: and thy pale hue Marks the deep wound that festers in thy soul. I see this, yet rejoice not: no, nor feel The triumph that repays, exalts the opprest When the oppressor falls. Behold these tears— They stream for thee—(clasping Clytemnestra's hand.) CLYTEMNESTRA. And have I yet a child? ELECTRA. Oh pow'r of heav'n! now give me words of force To change the soul. Turn not away, my mother! No whisper of reproach shall wound thy ear. We long have been estrang'd, not known each other: For ever, at my coming, base Ægisthus Stood like a fiend between us. Oh my mother, Year after year has past unheeded o'er thee. In the brief breathing space, this side the tomb In mercy left, one moment yet is thine: The present—Now. Oh! on the tablet of eternity Record it by contrition— CLYTEMNESTRA —(highly agitated, aside.) Oh, I cannot! ELECTRA. Turn not away—not for myself I plead. All, I forgive thee, all. I plead for one Lov'd more than life. I plead for lorn Orestes: For a lov'd brother; for thy son, I plead. Recal the wanderer— CLYTEMNESTRA. Oh! ELECTRA. At Argos crown him. Restore him to the empire of his fathers; So will I bear the votive gifts, and sooth Him, him that was thy husband. I will tend Thy troubled couch: nor leave thee at the hour When guilt at death's approach shall rise before thee A Fury arm'd. Repent, and crown Orestes. CLYTEMNESTRA. Ah, haply at this hour, he too— PHEDRA enters. Dread Queen! Sent from Ægisthus, at the palace gates A stranger youth— CLYTEMNESTRA. A stranger youth! PHEDRA. Who bears A funeral urn. CLYTEMNESTRA. 'Tis he—I come, I come— ELECTRA. Not yet—oh hear! CLYTEMNESTRA. My fate on him depends. ELECTRA. Now, on my knees, I pray one moment hear me. I saw thy big tear tremble. Oh, my mother! We never, since the day my father died, Have known one common woe. CLYTEMNESTRA. No more detain me. 'Tis he—away— ELECTRA —(in anger.) Dost thou despise my prayer? I on my bended knee, have clasp'd thy hand. CLYTEMNESTRA. Say, wilt thou bear these offerings to the dead? ELECTRA. Yes: or I ne'er shall view my father's tomb. CLYTEMNESTRA. Away.—(Exit.) ELECTRA to Phedra. Take thou the offerings—follow me. (Exeunt. SCENE changes to the Gates of the Palace, magnificently decorated with trophies. Phanor and Guards—Arcas, Orestes, Pylades. PHANOR. These are the gates with Ilium's trophies grac'd— Pass not that threshold—here expect the Queen. ORESTES —(after a pause of wonder.) Hail palace! and thou portal! o'er whose arch The spoils of Troy by Agamemnon plac'd— PYLADES —(interrupting him, aside.) Beware—we are observ'd—the guard yet lingers. CLYTEMNESTRA —(heard in entering.) Where is the stranger? Clytemnestra greets him. ORESTES —(hearing her voice, looks up.) Turn me to stone, or I am lost for ever. (Clytemnestra, Electra, Phedra enter.) Art thou the mother of Orestes? CLYTEMNESTRA. Yes— ORESTES. Whom then behold I there, of royal port? ELECTRA. His sister. ORESTES. Thou—Electra! ELECTRA. What of him? ORESTES. Thou, that Electra! thou—Orestes' sister. ELECTRA. Long suffering bears the show of length of years. Be but Orestes safe, and life new-born Will glow in every vein—thou answer'st not— Why art thou silent? CLYTEMNESTRA —(impatiently.) Say, what brought thee hither? Stranger! why thus transfixt in senseless woe? Why gaze on her? I, I am Clytemnestra. ORESTES. I come the bearer of a mournful tale To thee and to thy race. ELECTRA. Hah! CLYTEMNESTRA. Youth! disclose it. ORESTES. Heav'n haply has possest thee with a spirit That yields not to misfortune—on that brow—(Electra) I note alas! the lineaments of one Who will not hear my tale of woe, unmov'd— Let her depart: and one brief word unfolds My mournful mission.— CLYTEMNESTRA. Hear'st thou not, Electra? ELECTRA. Speak it. ORESTES. I pray thee urge her to retire. CLYTEMNESTRA —(to Electra.) Thou hear'st— ELECTRA. I stir not hence—my soul is dead Alike to joy and grief, save that alone Which from a brother flows—and if thou bring Ought of Orestes, 'till thy voice reveal it, No force shall hence remove me.— ORESTES —(to Electra.) Arm thy soul— Here lies, within this urn, what was Orestes. An Argive basely slew him—We, from Phocis, Bring this to place it in Atrides' tomb— Thou hast my mission.— ELECTRA. Wherefore should I breathe? I have no hope—earth! hide me in thy womb! (falls down.) ORESTES. Oh let me raise thee!— ELECTRA. Touch me not, I charge thee. Not with that hand that held Orestes' urn. My Father! thou shalt hear, and aid Electra.— (Exit. ORESTES. Oh! CLYTEMNESTRA. Heed her not!—thy unexpected words Have pierc'd my heart. Yet stranger! go not hence. (to all the others.) You—stand apart—good youth!— ORESTES —(with horror.) What would'st thou, woman? CLYTEMNESTRA. Thy aid! ORESTES. I cannot aid thee— CLYTEMNESTRA. Thou alone Canst free my soul from agonising horror. Gifts of rare worth shall crown thy prompt compliance. A feast is in the palace held this night: I shall not join the revels—while they banquet, Meet me alone. Things of high import urge. Why dost thou turn away? ORESTES. Meet thee alone! Oh! ask not that! CLYTEMNESTRA. A heav'n-taught Seer enjoin'd it— The prophet Calchas.— ORESTES. Ha! 'tis passing strange! CLYTEMNESTRA. Say thou consent'st— ORESTES. I'll meet thee. CLYTEMNESTRA. Lone— ORESTES. Expect me.— (Exeunt. End of Act 2d.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE 1st. —A Street in Argos. Orestes—Pylades. ORESTES. Arcas will soon return—here wait his coming. I must depart alone— PYLADES. Why force me from thee? ORESTES. Forbear— PYLADES. Not habit, nor the tyes of blood, But sympathy of nature made us one; We never have been sunder'd—hand in hand, We still with equal pace have shap'd our course Till this sad hour—our joys our griefs the same. One cradle rock'd our infant sleep. Our sports In youth the same; the same adventurous perils Enur'd our growing strength to stem the battle— ORESTES. Were it to stem the battle, Pylades! We were not now to part! PYLADES. Yet, let me join thee. Each wish, new springing in thy mind, ere utter'd, My ready zeal prevented. Grant me this. ORESTES. Brother, thou art unkind: it wrings my soul. Strange doubts perplex—I will not long be absent. There dwells the prophet. A brief word at once Unveils the mystery. I go alone. Farewel. PYLADES. Yet—go not thus in anger from me! ORESTES. Come, to my heart. And, if it seem, my brother, That there beyond just time I linger— PYLADES. Well— ORESTES. Seek me. PYLADES. I shall not fail—this, this is kind. One word—and then—farewell— ORESTES. Be brief— PYLADES. Orestes, Now, by the vow that death should ne'er disjoin us, When, prostrate at the hallow'd shrine of friendship, Tears, for each other shed, gush'd forth; I charge thee If the Seer threaten danger, call on me.— ORESTES. I would not live without thee. Art thou answer'd? PYLADES. Farewel. (Orestes goes.) His gloomy silence awes my soul. ARCAS enters. Where is Orestes? leave him not, I charge thee— PYLADES. Hast thou not prosper'd, Arcas? ARCAS. None are left Of Troy's proud conquerors, save neglected veterans Who dare not shew a scar. On every side New dangers threat. Suspicion closely marks us. E'en mid the license of the public feast The guards are doubled, and each question'd stranger Who falters in his answer— PHANOR —(to Arcas.) Follow me.— (guards enter. ARCAS. In what have I offended? PHANOR. Not unwatch'd Hast thou held secret conference with men Of sterner times, who shun us as a race That have forgôt our fathers. Come thou forth Where tortures shall force out unwilling truth. ARCAS —(looking on Pylades.) Be sure, no torture shall unlock these lips. PHANOR —(to Pylades.) Speak'st thou to him—thou too beware—his fate Perchance impends o'er thee. (Exeunt. PYLADES. Lost, lost Orestes! (Exit. SCENE changes to the Temple of Jupiter. CALCHAS —(to a Minister.) Now let him enter. The clear sparkling flame (Orestes slowly advances. Gave no ungrateful sign—approach the altar. ORESTES. Hail! CALCHAS. Not reluctance, youth! nor ought of honor Due to the Minister of highest Jove Delay'd thy entrance: holy rites enjoin'd it: And suppliant Kings must wait 'till fav'ring omens Permit approach.— ORESTES. Hail Seer! I bring thee not Off'rings of votive gold, and precious incense: No victim led by me shall stain the altar. If heav'n, ungifted, hears not him who calls, Seer, I retire in silence. CALCHAS. There are gifts Of higher rate than gold and hecatombs: Gifts, which from op'ning heav'n draw blessings down: The tribute of an uncorrupted heart. If such thy offering, speak— ORESTES. My years are few. As yet—these hands are pure—but— CALCHAS. Freely speak. ORESTES. If thou can read the heart, in mine behold The bitter conflict of a troubled spirit, That agonis'd by woe, doubt, fear, despair, Dreads e'en the wreck of reason.—Seer, assist me. CALCHAS. Poor youth! I pity thee—I will assist thee— My voice shall still the tumult of thy soul. ORESTES —(with vehemence.) Not that—thou must not still my soul—oh rather Urge to its height the storm, that so my arm May execute its mission—holy Seer! Thou talk'st to one of that disastrous mood Whose mind no longer master of itself Acts not its resolve. Seer! I am bound To deeds that shock my nature. 'Tis most horrible! Turn this to stone, (striking his breast) that, at the name of mother Sheds drops of blood, and I will do the deed! (falls on the altar. CALCHAS —(after a pause.) 'Tis He—the long expected—(aside) 'tis th'avenger. Thou must perform, unquestion'd, heavn's command ORESTES —(rising gradually almost to frenzy.) Prophets may speak, and Oracles pronounce “So move”—“this deed be done”—“'tis Heavn's command”— But they forget that the poor instrument To execute that will, is Man, weak Man. Rocks, at the call divine, leap from their base, Earth, at the word, deep to its centre shakes, The sea, and the wing'd storm, and fiery bolt Wait but a nod. Be these the instruments To execute heavn's vengeance on the world. But let not man be urg'd to shed man's blood. What, if the guilt of an abandon'd woman That slew her husband, calls down signal vengeance! Must the son plunge a dagger in the heart Of her who bore him? CALCHAS. Aid inspiring Jove! Offspring of Agamemnon, Troy's great conqueror, Orestes!— ORESTES. How—Orestes! why thus call A wandering stranger, a lost wretch unknown? CALCHAS —(with enthusiastic dignity.) I know thee—know thou me—'tis Calchas speaks. I, I, the minist'ring Priest, stood at the altar: This consecrated blade I hold before thee Gleam'd in my hand, descending swift in act To pierce the proffer'd bosom of thy sister, Whom Agamemnon to Diana's shrine Had led, his first-born, Iphigene, to slaughter. The virgin knelt beneath me, and to heav'n Look'd up with fearless eye. Before me, bow'd The father, in his mantle veil'd from sight. I heard his groan: deep as the groan of death. The father felt: the chief of Greece obey'd. Taught by thy father, son, obey the Gods. Fir'd by thy sister— ORESTES —(seising his dagger.) Seer—'tis done—thy dagger! CALCHAS. This never shall be stain'd with human blood. It flashes on my mind. Thy zeal transports thee. Hast thou forgotten it? not this the blade— Heav'n, in fit time, will arm thee with a weapon Forg'd for the dead.— ORESTES —(full of horror.) 'Tis true—the very blade, (Said it not so?) with which she slew my Father. So spake the Pythian: and that none, save that, And trusted to me by a mother's hand Must do its office. How shall I obtain it? CALCHAS. Go forth—thou shalt possess it—now delay not. Go to thy father's tomb, invoke his shade: There fate's portentous sign shall fix thy doom. If unappeas'd the spirit claim revenge, Strike, without dread—farewell.— ORESTES. Seer!—I obey— (Exeunt. SCENE changes to the Tomb of Agamemnon.—His statue in armour on the sepulchre. Electra.

Bring me the bowl—the offerings—on the tomb Lo, these I place: this, on the earth pour forth— Heard you that hissing foam? the unhallow'd stream Bubbles, and froths, and vanishes, in fumes Loathsome to sense. And, lo! the earth beneath Peel'd bare, as if the lightning, in its passage Had scath'd it, marking out to unborn ages A spot accurst, where grass nor herb shall spring. To Clytemnestra go.

He, He, for whom alone, hope yet awhile Sustain'd my soul, Orestes is no more. The rather thou arise! that, at thy voice, A woman's feeble arm may strike the blow Resistless as Jove's thunder—Hark! some step Approaches—here I may unseen retire 'Tis He—the Phocian whose unhallow'd tongue Proclaim'd Orestes' death.

Thou! here— ELECTRA. Nay—start not, stranger! Thou in my soul hast fixt a cureless wound: Yet, if thy heart be human, sooth my woe! ORESTES. What is thy wish? ELECTRA. Give me, I pray, that urn— ORESTES. This cannot sooth thy woe. ELECTRA. Thou ne'er hast known A sister's love— ORESTES. Alas! ELECTRA. Give me the urn— So never may'st thou know that grief of heart Which finds its only solace in the tear That falls upon the dust of one most lov'd.— ORESTES —(aside to Pylades.) How shall I act? ELECTRA. Thus—on my knee— ORESTES. Oh rise! ELECTRA. Consent, I pray—the tears steal down thy cheek! Oh youth! thou can'st not now refuse my pray'r. ORESTES —(to Pylades.) Rise—take it!—Friend! these gushing tears betray me— PYLADES. Be firm! 'twere dangerous to reveal the truth.— ELECTRA —(clasping the urn.) Orestes! oh my brother! oh sole cause For whom I have sustain'd year after year The ills of loath'd existence! Thou art gone! Thou too hast lest me! lest me, rest of hope, To shed lone tears that bathe th'unfeeling urn. Was it for this I snatcht thee from the cradle When keen-ey'd murther thirsted for thy blood? I rescued thee that thou in manhood's strength Might rise th'avenger of a father's death: Rise, the restorer of a glorious race Which sprung from Jove! here, here, alas! thou liest. While yet my hand has strength to hold the urn, Oh while my lips now press the farewell kiss, Strike, strike me dead, kind Heav'n! and thou, oh stranger! (I have no kin, no friend, no brother left) Here place Electra.—Blest alone in this, That death unites her ashes with Orestes.— ORESTES —(bursting from Pylades.) I will not be restrain'd—thou hast a Brother. Behold Orestes here.— ELECTRA. Thou—thou—Orestes! ORESTES. Behold this well-known sign.— ELECTRA. Oh! (shrieks. ORESTES. Trust the oath Of vengeance breath'd on Agamemnon's tomb. ELECTRA —(rushing to his arms.) I trust my heart—and do I hold thee living? Oh, let me gaze on thee, thou godlike youth! Clasp thee again! oh let me feel once more The pressure of thy arms, and thy warm breath That pours new life within me. ORESTES. Oh, my sister! And is it thus we meet? how pale thy cheek! Oh thou hast suffer'd much! ELECTRA. 'Tis all forgotten— Oh, golden light of day! and thou great Jove! Hear my exulting voice! PYLADES —(interrupting her.) Restrain, Electra! These shouts of clamorous joy— ELECTRA. What envious stranger Dares interrupt my transport? ORESTES. Look on him— 'Tis Pylades—my friend. ELECTRA. My second brother! Thou com'st to share our triumph. PYLADES. Oh restrain Thy transport—much I fear— ELECTRA —(interrupting him.) What cause for fear? Doubt'st thou success will crown us? 'tis Orestes! Who can oppose him? so stood Hercules When the Nemæan lion gasp'd beneath him. ORESTES. This is no hour of triumph—cease Electra! This is the dreadful crisis mark'd by fate. My Pylades! thou know'st that none on earth, Save Agamemnon's offspring, must be present When I invoke his shade, and claim the signal, Dread harbinger of vengeance. PYLADES. I must leave thee— ORESTES. To Calchas go—there, in due time, expect me.—(Exit.) Electra, hear! nor interrupt my words, How strange soe'er— ELECTRA. Speak—not the dead more silent— ORESTES. It fits thee, but in part, and briefly, now, To know how past my youth:—let this suffice: Such lore, as suits a monarch, Strophius gave. When the first down began to shade my cheek, (A few fleet months now past) Strophius reveal'd My birth, till then unknown; and at the shrine Of Phœbus, bade me from the God enquire My future fate—I went—a voice thus hail'd me. “Son of a murder'd Father! thine to slay “The slayers—they, by fraud, the chieftain smote. “By fraud they perish. At thy twentieth year” (Complete this day, e'en this, on which they hold The feast of blood)—“to Argos go, thyself, “The bearer of the tale that speaks thee dead. “At midnight—in the bath—on the same spot “Where bled Atrides—with the self-same weapon, “That steel with which the wife her husband slew, “Son, pierce thy mother's bosom”—at the word I swoon'd—Electra—(she seems fainting.) ELECTRA. I am sick at heart— ORESTES. Oh thou hast more to hear, more dreadful far! ELECTRA. 'Tis past—proceed— ORESTES. A voice of thunder rous'd me— “Mortal! if thou dispute the will of heav'n, “Hear thy dread sentence—thou shalt roam o'er earth “Stranger to man. No house shall give thee shelter: “No hospitable board afford thee food: “The rock thy resting-place: thy fellowship “With beasts of prey: foul leprosy shall eat “Thy life, by lingering pangs slow worn away.” ELECTRA —(highly agitated.) Brother, thou shalt obey. They knew not mercy. ORESTES. I dare not disobey—Look here, (shews his arm) Electra! ELECTRA. 'Tis horrible— ORESTES. And ne'er to be effac'd But by the gushing blood of her who bore me— ELECTRA. Thrice, thrice she struck the blow, without remorse— What follow'd, quickly speak— ORESTES. With shuddering awe I bow'd, and touch'd the altar—then the voice Spake as before. “To Argos, go, invoke “Thy Father's shade: if, unappeas'd, the manes “Claim justice, the fixt statue on his tomb “Shall thrice, in sign of vengeance, wave his spear.” ELECTRA —(starting up.) Shade of my Father! rise, and save Orestes. Begin the invocation.— ORESTES. Yet—my sister!— ELECTRA. Why this delay? ORESTES. I have a secret grief. I dread to utter it— ELECTRA. Confide in me. ORESTES. He knows it not, the friend, the bosom friend, Who reads my heart—I would not shock his soul. He, He, perhaps, would fly this fated wretch.— ELECTRA. Electra never—by our Father's spirit Who watches o'er us, I conjure thee, speak.— ORESTES. Know, when my mother bleeds (so spake the voice) Her furies from that hour shall goad me on, (Rendering each day a curse, each night unholy,) From land to land, 'till back to Greece I bring From Tauris' shrine, with blood of strangers stain'd, One sacred to Diana—this was utter'd: And, that of all on earth, but One alone Should watch my flight, and tend me at the hour When Furies howl around me— ELECTRA. Lo! that one. Mid direst woe, the Furies howling round, Rendering each day a curse, each night unholy, I, I, will tend thee; and my soul shall feel it Bliss, all that earth can give. For thou, my Brother, Wilt on this sheltering bosom rest thy brow: And, when, at intervals, peace sooths thy soul, Thou too wilt turn a kindred eye on mine, And kindly look on me—delay no more. Begin the invocation.— ORESTES. Now, Electra, Gaze on the statue with unshrinking eye. I dare not trust my senses. If it stir, In silence follow me—Shade of my Father! If unappeas'd thy manes:—if the blood Of those who slew thee shall be shed for thine, If 'tis thy awful mandate that the son Should slay his mother— (Mid peals of thunder and flashes of lightning the Statue waves the spear, and a voice cries “Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance.”) End of ACT 3d.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE 1st. —The Temple of Jupiter. CALCHAS. The light'ning flash'd—the Spirit claims revenge— Dark prophecies, of old obscurely veil'd Flash on the sight—the son shall slay his mother! Soul of the guilty! melt with fear! shake earth! While Justice from her adamantine throne Looks down, and says, “Be done.”— PYLADES enters. Some danger low'rs.— They are not at the tomb—forlorn Orestes Who shall protect thee now? CALCHAS. —The pow'r who sent him. Wait thou the destin'd time— PYLADES. Yet, Seer! reflect, The horrors of the scene, the gloom of death, The invocation of a vengeful spirit, The call and summons to a mother's murder, And that portentous signal which confounds The faculties of man: these, singly, shake Minds of firm texture: and combin'd 'gainst one Of soul so deeply agonis'd, at once May o'erturn reason.—Hah! (seeing Arcas enter.) ARCAS. Time-honor'd Calchas.— PYLADES. Ha!—can it be?—thou never hast betray'd us— ARCAS. They might have torn my body, limb by limb, These lips were clos'd for ever. PYLADES. What preserv'd thee? ARCAS. The visible arm and agency of heav'n.— CALCHAS. Hear, son of Strophius! And, in still reverence bow before the Gods. PYLADES. Relate what pass'd. ARCAS. I stood before Ægisthus. 'Twas noontide: bright the sun, the monarch rode In pomp of triumph. Then while loud his slaves Shouted “Behold a God,” from cloudless heav'n Jove shot the lightning down, and all was still. CALCHAS. They knew not what it meant—I watch'd the bolt That flash'd portentous, as the answ'ring spirit Claim'd vengeance. ARCAS. Unappall'd, the tyrant rag'd: Again the lightning struck, his steeds transfixt Fell breathless. On his seat the monarch leapt Upright: his rent robes flutter'd, and his hair Stream'd loosely, sing'd with flame: but, in his eye Pride glow'd, and indignation: and his brow Uplifted, hurl'd defiance 'gainst the God. He mock'd at heav'n, and earth: and, at the sight Of me in chains, smil'd in contemptuous mood, And bad me join the feast. Attendant enters. Prophet! Ægisthus Now summons thee. CALCHAS. Say, I attend. Go, thou— (To Arcas.) Murderer! I will confront thee, and each word Of prescient truth, to every ear, but thine, Shall mark thy imminent death! Electra, and Orestes close veil'd, enter. PYLADES. Electra here! Why thus close veil'd? (to Orestes.) why this mysterious silence? ELECTRA. —(to Pylades.) Speak to him. (to Orestes.) 'Tis thy friend—'tis Pylades. ORESTES. Bid him avoid me—say is Calchas here? PYLADES. Orestes! look upon me— ORESTES. Touch me not— Away—unveil not this devoted head. PYLADES. Come to my arms. ORESTES. My touch conveys pollution— PYLADES. Whate'er thy doom, 'tis mine— ORESTES —(uncovering himself.) Let all avoid me: This head is self-devoted to the Furies. PYLADES. What words are these? explain their awful meaning. Wilt thou not speak? ORESTES. I dare a nameless deed: And now fate summons to a conference, That more than death appals me. PYLADES. Oh! ORESTES. Nay sigh not— No pitying sigh, no sound of soothing voice Must now be heard by me. Such sounds would melt me. I have held conference with a form of night: My powers, each sense, and living faculty, My soul, and its affections, all are bound To beings that inhabit other worlds: To this estrang'd and dead—Calchas! prepare The solemn rites— CALCHAS. Come. ORESTES —(going, turns back.) Pylades—Electra— ELECTRA. Oh brother!—brother! PYLADES. More than life belov'd! ORESTES. Friend! Sister! Oh I dare not say—farewel! (Exit with Calchas. PYLADES. Selected minister of Jove! farewel! ELECTRA. Avenger of a murther'd sire! farewel! He hears, and waves me back—I now may weep— Thou, whom I look on with a sister's eye, Oh think not harshly of me, that a woman Excites to vengeance—bear with me, I pray— My heart is overcharg'd, and I have never Found friendly ear, wherein I dar'd to breathe, The whisper of a woe— PYLADES. You see a brother— ELECTRA. Not nature, but dire wrongs have steel'd Electra. Thou heard'st his words; each sense, and faculty, His soul, and his affections (so he spake) Were dead to earth, estrang'd from human kind. And wherefore dead to earth? alas! his spirit Had commun'd with th'unearthly—with whom then Has lorn Electra commun'd? kindred beings? Had I a mother? no—a murthress rear'd me. What love? what cares? what counsel? what example Such as debase the soul, to vilest passions Give brute excess: such as to name, shall never Pollute my virgin lip. PYLADES. I pity thee— ELECTRA. No pity—spare me that—I am high soul'd— How else had I existed? how sustain'd While youth decay'd, year after year, to see A base adulterer in Atrides' robes, O'er me extend the sceptre of my race, And when a tear gush'd forth, insult my woe? Hear him revile my father's memory: And, if I look'd but stern, bid Phrygian slaves Chain my free hands? so have I liv'd for vengeance— Dread, unexampled vengeance. PYLADES. Such dire wrongs Pass human sufferance. Would I might assist thee! ELECTRA. Thou can'st assist me—thou like one from heav'n Can'st soothe Electra. PYLADES. Can this dagger aid thee! ELECTRA. Brave youth! Orestes' arm is strongly nerv'd— From thee I ask no act of blood, but one Of unexampled kindness— PYLADES. Speak thy wish. ELECTRA. Hear then—Orestes nurst a woe in secret, That prey'd upon his mind: from thee withheld, Kindly withheld, lest it should shock thy nature: Or, in th'unguarded transport of affection, Bind thee in fellowship of woe with him To nameless sufferings— PYLADES. Unkind Orestes! ELECTRA. The Oracle decreed— E'en from the moment that he strikes the murthress, Her persecuting Furies should pursue him, 'Till from the Tauric shrine he bring to Greece One sacred to Diana—in his flight, Mid the wild ravings of a mind distraught, This too was told—“that one of all who live “Alone should tend his woe.” PYLADES. Jove here my vow! That charge be mine! ELECTRA. Not if Electra live; But, what the issue of this day of blood Who who can tell? when danger calls Orestes I shall not stand aloof—if there I perish Remember thou thy oath— PYLADES. 'Tis seal'd in heav'n. ELECTRA. Farewel heroic youth! live thou renown'd The theme of future ages! at the name Of Pylades, let friendship hail the sound, And tears, like mine, from glowing transport gush— (Exeunt. SCENE changes to Clytemnestra's apartment. CLYTEMNESTRA. (walking to and fro in apparent agitation.) The stranger youth! he comes not! Phedra left him Unmindful of the passing revellers Lone in the outward court—she bad him enter, Said, that I thrice had summon'd him: He groan'd, And seem'd most loath to come!—why loth to come? And whence these throbs portentous at my heart, As if the soul unknowing what the woe Gave presage of misfortune?—Ha! I hear Their tread—they come—oh how they linger! sure I catch their echoed voices— PHEDRA —(behind the scenes.) Here—I pray thee Enter—why turn away? ORESTES —(behind the scenes.) Oh horror! horror! CLYTEMNESTRA. (rushing out, returns leading in Orestes—Phedra follows.) Here—here—why this reluctance? thou, keep watch, Strict watch, that none approach: no curious ear Lurk nigh this chamber—hence—(Phedra goes)—none hear us now. Why this repugnance, youth? ORESTES. Let me depart. CLYTEMNESTRA. Why dost thou tremble, stranger? ORESTES. Grief—deep grief Breeds strange confusion. I would fain depart— CLYTEMNESTRA —(stopping him.) Stay youth, thou must not hence—thou fear'st, perhaps, I shall regard thee with ungracious eye, For that thy voice, to Clytemnestra, first Spoke of Orestes' death. ORESTES. That, doubtless, that To common minds were cause to cleave the heart, Did not a mother hear those piercing words “Thy Son is dead?” CLYTEMNESTRA —(reluctantly.) He would have murther'd me? ORESTES. A mother!—and a son!—oh horrible— 'Tis a sad strife for blood! CLYTEMNESTRA. I slew him not. ORESTES. Not him—but— CLYTEMNESTRA —(highly agitated.) Stranger! ORESTES. Well—thy wish, thy wish— What would'st thou with me? CLYTEMNESTRA. I would win thy favour. ORESTES. Oh! CLYTEMNESTRA. Why that groan? ORESTES. We all have secret griefs— Briefly disclose thy wish, and let me hence— For I have that deep woe within my soul That other's misery can claim no part. CLYTEMNESTRA. Would I could sooth thy grief, as thou can'st mine! To thee I must my inmost heart unbosom— For tho' thy brow be stern, and strange thy look, Youth is the time when sympathising pity Most sways the yielding bosom—thou art young, And misery, such as mine, will touch thy soul.— ORESTES. Oh! oh! CLYTEMNESTRA. If thus thy groan, ere thou hast heard it, Ah! what—when utter'd—Youth! thou see'st before thee, No queen resplendent in the pomp of pow'r, Her high soul swelling o'er with boundless bliss. The wretch, whose cry has never reach'd my ear, The unfed beggar, shivering at my gate Is far more blest than I!—He, at the close Of each sad day, in rest of sleep, may find Relief from woe: and revel in the dream That lifts him o'er this world's unequal lot To feast with Jove—my dream is of the dead— Of spirits howling in eternal torture— And when I rise, 'Tis from the bed of visionary horrors To feel them real—pity, sooth, relieve me! Fate has decreed that thou of all mankind Alone can'st free me— ORESTES. —I!— CLYTEMNESTRA. Thou know'st it well— ORESTES. I know it— CLYTEMNESTRA. Turn not thus thy looks away— Here look on me, and as my eye meets thine, Give answer— ORESTES. Gaze not on me—I will answer— CLYTEMNESTRA. Has not an oracle been heard by thee? ORESTES. 'Tis certain.—I have heard prophetic sounds. CLYTEMNESTRA. Calchas forewarn'd me—wilt thou not relieve me? Thy heart is like thy brow: but I have gifts That shall persuade assent. ORESTES. Gifts!—bribes—to me— For this!— CLYTEMNESTRA —(in rage.) And, I have pow'r, unbounded pow'r, That shall enforce compliance— ORESTES —(full of horror.) Force!—beware— CLYTEMNESTRA. Thy pale cheek flashes with unwonted fire: Again, resistless shudders shake thy frame. Nay—fear not—let compassion touch thy heart! Hear, innocent youth! thou know'st not what it is: Thou hast no stain of blood upon thy soul. Could'st thou conceive!—no—none but murtherers can, The tortures that await them!—I have felt them— I have giv'n answer at the dead of night To tongueless calls: my couch has been beset With shapeless forms: the Furies of the slain Have toss'd their torches round me, and their locks Knotted with adders— ORESTES. Cease—my brain's on fire— Oh spare me! spare me! CLYTEMNESTRA. Meet me on—the spot— Down from thy brow big drops in horror roll— (Orestes fixes his eyes on a dagger in the apartment.) Why are thine eyes fix'd on yon glittering scabbard? ORESTES. Spak'st thou not now of gifts?—give me that dagger, And I will meet thee at the destin'd place.— CLYTEMNESTRA. I have rare gems and gold—those shall reward thee: That steel is nothing worth— ORESTES. Give me that dagger— I'll meet thee on the spot— CLYTEMNESTRA. Why strangely prize it?— ORESTES. What! is it strange that man to battle bred Should value a man's weapon? one, perhaps That grac'd 'mid wond'ring chiefs, Atrides' side. Refuse it, death in tortures ne'er shall daunt me. CLYTEMNESTRA —(gives it.) Thou know'st not with what blade I arm thy hand. ORESTES —(full of horror.) There is no blood on thee, thou shining steel! (aside, drawing the blade. CLYTEMNESTRA. Swear thou wilt meet Ægisthus— ORESTES —(ardently interrupting her.) Aye— CLYTEMNESTRA. And me, At midnight—where— ORESTES. Nay, nay, I know it all— In the blood-sprinkled bath.— CLYTEMNESTRA. By oath confirm it.— ORESTES. An oath too!—by my Father's memory! CLYTEMNESTRA —(gives him two keys.) Take these—this guards the passage—this, the bath— Be there—and watch the tread of foot;—if mine, This hand shall at the portal give the signal— That heard, admit me.— ORESTES. I have sworn— CLYTEMNESTRA. Farewel. (Exeunt. End of ACT 4th.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE a Street before the Palace. Calchas, Pylades. CALCHAS. Obey—not mine the dictate—Jove there guides me. Deem not that stern Ægisthus' summons mov'd me To join the feast of murther. PYLADES. I obey. Yet bid me not with tame forbearance hear His insults, unaveng'd—oh! bid me plunge This dagger in his heart, and there behold me Stab the proud tyrant on his guarded throne. CALCHAS. Leave him to heav'n—fate, at the destin'd time Will crush the impious. PYLADES. Seer, once more I urge thee, May I not aid Orestes?— CALCHAS. Not this night— The time shall come, when Pylades alone Shall aid, alone shall sooth his frantic woe. (as they are going out they meet Electra. ELECTRA. Say, hast thou seen Orestes? I, in vain Have search'd the palace round.— CALCHAS. He pass'd not here— PYLADES. How hast thou scap'd unnotic'd? ELECTRA. None keep watch— The guards are steep'd in riotous excess. Oh were not force forbidden! we ourselves, Few as we are, might boldly dare the deed, And master these brute revellers. CALCHAS —(to Electra.) Go Electra, And if thou find Orestes, I enjoin thee, Not unattended let him seek the bath. I dread his troubled spirit.— ELECTRA. Guide me, Jove! Thanks holy Prophet— (Exit. CALCHAS —(to Pylades.) To the banquet, come! (Exeunt. SCENE changes to a lone and gloomy Court. ORESTES. This is fit place! no voice is heard—no tread Breaks on this noiseless gloom—I saw the sun Go calmly down—Yet—once—('tis said) the God Turn'd back with horror from Thyestes' feast. Of kindred blood, I dare a kindred deed— Let me not dwell on't. 'Tis not yet the hour. Yon clouds, that gather o'er me, thickly veil All that has form and hue in deepest gloom! Man sees not Man. The outward beam is dim— Yet, ah! more clearly the internal light Glares on the thought close-shrouded in the soul. I hear a step. ELECTRA enters. Orestes! oh where art thou? ORESTES. It is her voice!— ELECTRA. Who speaks?—Orestes! answer— ORESTES. I would this had not been! ELECTRA. 'Tis he—my brother. ORESTES. I look'd not for this meeting. My intent Is fixt—I shun all human intercourse. Depart—I pray— ELECTRA. If 'tis thy wish—I go— But—thus to part in fearful ignorance!— ORESTES. Thou wilt not then with woman's pity melt me?— ELECTRA. Fix on thy heart thy hand, and count its beats, Then question mine—our aim, our souls are one— I will not vex thee with vain strife of words, Turning thy spirit from its great intent: But if thou hold my blood allied to thine, Confide in me— ORESTES —(shewing the dagger.) I have the dagger—here— ELECTRA. Enough— ORESTES. And I have vow'd— ELECTRA. What vow?— ORESTES. At midnight To meet her at the bath— ELECTRA. Th'adulterer with her? ORESTES. He shall not 'scape—'tis likewise fix'd, that I Go, ere the hour—these (the keys) give me entrance—then At signal, I admit them— ELECTRA. So far, well!— But— ORESTES. Why this pause? ELECTRA. Thou goest not there alone— ORESTES. I want no aid—oh be my heart but firm This arm dreads no resistance. ELECTRA. None shall aid thee. The son of Agamemnon shall alone Claim, vindicate, and wear his father's honors— But the dread deed is destin'd in the place Where bled thy father—at the hour he fell— ORESTES. I know it—aye, and justly so ordain'd— ELECTRA. There thou must lonely wait th'appointed time. ORESTES. Well— ELECTRA. How shall pass the dreary interval? No light has glanc'd on that accursed spot Since there he bled— ORESTES. A lamp dispels the gloom— ELECTRA. To witness what? the robe which shrouded him, Thrice rent, where each deep stroke did pierce his heart. Thou wilt have leisure time: for what? to gaze on The brazen bath crusted with unwash'd stains: To count the drops of blood that spot the floor: And gather, one by one, wherever scatter'd, Each hair, with blood distain'd, rent from his head In the last struggle when he gasp'd for breath. ORESTES. Thou shak'st my soul. ELECTRA. And thou wilt hear his groan As the adulteress smote him: and his moan That feebly murmur'd “mercy,” when she seiz'd him, So that he stirr'd not underneath the hand— These, and lone brooding o'er the vengeful blow May, haply, none, none near thee— ORESTES —(seizing her arm.) Cease! Electra, Come! let us go together— ELECTRA. Thus, Orestes, Thus join'd, all, all will prosper. ORESTES. Be thou present! Shade of my father! rise! and claim revenge— Exeunt. SCENE—The Palace. Clytemnestra and Phedra. PHEDRA. Loud rung their mirth—before I reach'd the hall The tumult met my ear: I scarce could pass The press of guests that round Ægisthus clamor'd. I spake thy words, and much I wonder, Queen! That thus he lingers— CLYTEMNESTRA. Few are found, who quit With willing speed, the feast and crouded banquet At misery's call. And yet, methinks, Ægisthus Had hasten'd when I urg'd. You spake my words! PHEDRA. When I drew near him, his bow'd head hung o'er A heavy goblet charg'd with wine. I rous'd him, And thrice repeated what thou spak'st—he heard, And gave (forgive the utterance) slow assent— CLYTEMNESTRA. Reluctantly comply'd!—you misconceiv'd— You importun'd him rudely at the banquet— He comes—it is himself—leave us—(exit as Ægisthus enters) Ægisthus! Why this delay? know, I have lonely groan'd In restless expectation. ÆGISTHUS. Clytemnestra Thou should'st have join'd our revels— CLYTEMNESTRA. What! to smile On flattering fools, regardless of my doom, When boding visitations summon me To fate's uncertain issue? thou hast heard The supernatural vision— ÆGISTHUS. Woman's fears!— CLYTEMNESTRA. Light-hearted man! when Clytemnestra shakes No brood of idle fancy floats before her— The shape I saw was palpable as thine. Laugh with thy slaves—to me give serious heed. The banquet and the bowl awhile forget: I claim that strict observance which the cause Imperiously demands— ÆGISTHUS. Speak—I attend—(a laugh and festal shout are heard.) Heard'st thou that shout? I would the shape that scar'd thee Might dare confront our feasters— CLYTEMNESTRA —(with highest indignation.) 'Twas—Atrides—(Ægisthus starts back.) Aye—start—the grapes thick fumes o'ercloud thy brain. But I will rouse thee to thy native terror. When answering torches on from Mount to Mount, From Ida's crest to Argos, spake that Troy Was levell'd, and the lord of Greece, the conqueror, The son of Atreus, Agamemnon, sped In triumph to his realm: Who then preserv'd thee? ÆGISTHUS. Forbear— CLYTEMNESTRA. In prostrate guise, thou call'd'st on me. I struck the warrior low. Thou stood'st aloof— I sav'd, I wedded, I first hail'd thee, King— ÆGISTHUS. Forbear—I will obey thee— CLYTEMNESTRA. Mark at least, Not mine the wreck of peace, of fame, of virtue, For base ingratitude—be what thou wilt But not ungrateful. ÆGISTHUS. How can I assist thee? Thy will is mine. CLYTEMNESTRA. Thus—'tis decreed above, That from the youth, who bore Orestes' urn, I claim deliverance from these madd'ning horrors. The mystery of fate is known to him. And ere two hours are past, the time is mark'd, At midnight—in the Bath—where fell Atrides, I meet the youth: thou too must join my steps— Delay not when I call. ÆGISTHUS. I now am ready. Let us prevent his step. CLYTEMNESTRA. Hast thou no fear? ÆGISTHUS. The place I fear not: nor that beardless youth— CLYTEMNESTRA. Thou hast no weapon with thee—this at least Were prudent, to go arm'd— ÆGISTHUS. Give me thy dagger. CLYTEMNESTRA. The youth requested it.— ÆGISTHUS. Thou—trust that dagger To one scarce known to thee! well—'tis the hand That gives the steel its worth—I will go arm'd— Fear not—I will protect thee— CLYTEMNESTRA. Thou protect me! Oh be but with me! go—and if thou feast, Avoid excess—be ready at the summons. (Exeunt. SCENE changes to a magnificent banqueting-room, thronged with guests, and sumptuously decorated. Musicians, Singers, &amp;c. &amp;c. Phanor—Guests. PHANOR. 'Tis but a transient absence—on his brow Low'rd discontent—the king was loath to leave us. Our mirth shall chase his gloom. On his return, Swift at his entrance, wake the lyre and flute, And raise the festive chorus—Lo! he comes. ÆGISTHUS enters. (instruments and voices strike up saluting him.) PHANOR. Hail monarch!—hail!— (choral song.) ÆGISTHUS. —I greet you all—most welcome— The intervening moments, which, like clouds Crossing the sun, broke rudely on our mirth, By shew of grateful contrast, give new zest And relish to enjoyment—Welcome all.— PHANOR. Monarch of Argos! hail! ÆGISTHUS. This fits th'occasion— My spirits, with redoubled ardor, rush To swell your transport—fill again the bowl. That strain once more— (chorus is repeated.) Fling wide the palace gates—the wond'ring strangers Shall gaze on our magnificence—say, Phanor, Where is the Prophet?—him I bade attend; His oft-repeated threat will raise our mirth— Looks this like heav'n's displeasure? Where the strangers That met us in our triumph?— PHANOR. —They attend. We but delay'd, Ægisthus, 'till thy nod Gave sign of entrance.— ÆGISTHUS. Let them now advance— Enter Pylades and Arcas. PHANOR. Make way, make way. PYLADES. I pray thee, leave us here— ÆGISTHUS. Who speaks?— PHANOR. The stranger Phocians— ÆGISTHUS. Forward lead them. Look! how they gaze, in speechless wonder lost. PHANOR. The gorgeous majesty of Argos, dazzles The unaccustom'd eye— ÆGISTHUS. Your Phocian feasts Are poor to these? PYLADES. No—our's—are holy banquets Whereon the Gods look down—not feasts of blood. PHANOR. Lo! Calchas comes— (as the Prophet slowly advances, the scene gradually darkens.) ÆGISTHUS. Where is the hoary Prophet? PHANOR. What strange obscurity o'erclouds the banquet? ÆGISTHUS. I scarce can see his face!—give me thy torch— Why dost thou gaze so fixedly upon me? (to Calchas.) CALCHAS. The tears gush down thy cheek!—thou see'st them not— Thy groans—ill-fated wretch! thou hear'st them not— ÆGISTHUS. Are these thy wonted threat'nings? CALCHAS. —I speak none— Dread what the heav'ns denounce! (violent thunder and lightning.) PHANOR. The arch'd vault shakes! ÆGISTHUS. Methinks I sit like Jove enthron'd 'mid Gods, While lightnings sport beneath me!— (the guests disperse in much confusion.) CALCHAS. Impious wretch! PHANOR. How shall we 'scape? the roof is cop'd with flames. Round every column streams the lightning's blaze. ÆGISTHUS. (flinging away the bowl, which he had lifted to his lips.) Fill me another bowl—This tastes of blood— (pours out a mock libation.) This is our wonted offering to the shade Of slain Atrides— (the voice that spoke at the tomb is heard.) Vengeance! vengeance! vengeance! Attendant on Clytemnestra enters. King! Clytemnestra calls— ÆGISTHUS. I haste— CALCHAS. To death— (Exeunt. SCENE the vaults leading to the bath. Orestes and Electra. ORESTES. I am prepar'd for all—take thou the lamp. So: hold the light. These locks by time encrusted Will not give way. (his hand trembles, that he cannot rightly direct the key.) ELECTRA. It is thy hand that trembles. Give me the key. The springs resist not—now (the door opens.) Force back the iron grate—why dost thou start? This way—thy hand, Orestes—follow me— ORESTES. 'Tis loathsome as the charnel-house. (he lingers, and turns away.) ELECTRA. Quick, quick, Hasten thy step—heed not—'twill pass away— ORESTES. The damps imprison'd in this unsun'd vault Strike me with death-like chill—hold up the light— 'Tis midnight darkness— ELECTRA. Come. ORESTES. Thy single lamp Scarce shoots a glimmering ray athwart the gloom. ELECTRA. Oh do not wish for more! ORESTES. I understand thee— I shall not see her when I lift my arm— I would not see her face— ELECTRA. Banish these thoughts— ORESTES —(in the utmost horror.) Oh sister! if her eye should glance on mine! (in passing on, he strikes his foot against the brazen bath.) What's this, which as I struck it unawares Did loudly ring, and vibrate 'gainst my foot?— ELECTRA. Oh ask not! pass this way— ORESTES. Ah! 'tis the bath In which he perish'd! quick, take back the light— ELECTRA. This way—here wait, shrouded in thickest gloom— ORESTES —(starting forward in extreme agitation.) Hah! seest thou not? ELECTRA. What moves thee? ORESTES. 'Mid the darkness There, there, it dimly gleams—unclasp my hand— ELECTRA —(vainly attempting to hold him.) Why dost thou struggle from me! ORESTES. 'Tis the robe— (seizes it.) ELECTRA. Keep firm his brain, oh Phœbus!— ORESTES —(displaying the robe to the light.) Heav'n and Earth! Thrice pierc'd!—and where the accursed dagger smote him, Each rent blood-stain'd, yet marks the blow of hell— Die murth'ress! (quite frantic) call me not “thy Son, thy Son.” Clasp not my hand!—bare not thy breast to me— Die murthress! lo! she falls—this hand has stab'd her. Ha! what are ye, that from each drop of blood Start into life? foul hags! your blazing locks Are viper-knotted. Why thus strain tow'rds me Your eye-balls roll'd in blood? ye shall not grasp me— Stretch all your wings—I fly before the wind.—(He falls exhausted.) ELECTRA. My brother!—(endeavouring to hold him in his struggles.) ORESTES. Hah! ELECTRA. Know'st thou not me? ORESTES. I know thee— Thou art my mother's Fury—thou hast seiz'd me To whirl me into Tartarus—(violently struggling)—off, off, Down to the realms of torture— ELECTRA. Oh my brother! ORESTES —(recovering.) Electra! ELECTRA. Lov'd Orestes! oh my brother! ORESTES. Thou! ELECTRA. 'Tis thy sister clasps thee in her arms. These are Electra's tears that wet thy cheek. ORESTES. Clasp me—nay closer—are they fled away? ELECTRA. 'Twas but the coinage of thy brain— ORESTES. Indeed— (a noise of approaching steps.) I hear the tread of feet—they come—they come— ÆGISTHUS —(is heard behind the scenes.) Where is the youth that brought Orestes' urn? Give entrance to Ægisthus— ORESTES. 'Tis th'Adulterer— I am myself again—King! enter in—(opens the door.) ÆGISTHUS —(in entering.) Go slaves! bid Clytemnestra haste—away— ORESTES —to Electra, as Ægisthus enters. This is a righteous blow! hold up the lamp, That we may view each other, face to face. ÆGISTHUS —enters. Boy! drop that lifted dagger, or thou diest— (drawing his sword.) ORESTES —(stabs him.) 'Tis I, Orestes, Agamemnon's son Who smite thee to the heart—(he falls groaning.) ELECTRA. So fall the base, Th'adulterer, and oppressor!—hark! I hear A hasty foot—art thou prepar'd? ORESTES. Oh heav'n! Quick, close that gate. Cast o'er this wretch the robe: Yet faint his groan. So veil, that sight, nor sound Give warning to her ere I strike the blow— I would not shock her soul before the time: Enough that this must be— ELECTRA. Is there ought else? ORESTES. Put out thy light—(she extinguishes it)—the lamp too which she bears, On sudden, with swift hand, extinguish it. If but a ray break forth, this dagger drops. CLYTEMNESTRA —(knocks thrice.) 'Tis I, 'tis Clytemnestra, give me entrance— ORESTES. Quick, quick, unbar the portal— (at her entrance, Electra dashes out her lamp.) CLYTEMNESTRA. What rude hand Has seiz'd the lamp? where art thou stranger? speak— Ægisthus? ÆGISTHUS. Oh— CLYTEMNESTRA. A death-groan strikes my ear— What's this which bars my way? it is the robe Which tangled him—there's one that stirs beneath: And blood, warm blood, spouts thro' the heaving folds— ÆGISTHUS —(faintly.) Fly—I am slain—Orestes' dagger pierc'd me— He is the stranger—fly. (he dies.) (as she attempts to fly, Orestes seizes her with one hand, with the other holds the dagger over her.) CLYTEMNESTRA. What chill hand grasps me? ORESTES. Thou must not live— CLYTEMNESTRA. Spare me—my Son! my Son! Strike not this breast that nurtur'd thee! have pity!— My Son! my Son! have pity on thy mother— ORESTES —(turns his face away.) I cannot wound her— (the voice that spoke at the tomb.) “Vengeance! vengeance! vengeance!” CLYTEMNESTRA —(shrieks.) Oh! 'tis Atrides' voice—there is no hope— Thus—thus—my arm shall aid thy lingering blow. (seizes his arm, and rushes on the dagger.) (The curtain falls.) FINIS.</field>
