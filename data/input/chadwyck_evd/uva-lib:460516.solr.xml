      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Piazza del Granduca.âLuigi del Passato, seated among some statues. Pass. I have forgotten my fatigue of limbs Among the works of Art. Long was my journey, And somewhat grievous in the lack of means; But patient hearts oft sleep away their cares Upon an empty scrip, and rove in dream Thro' the antique Age of Gold. I am content. Fair Florence, hail!âhad I no hopes beside, The hope of years is satisfied. 'Tis said Duke Cosmo is a patron of large mind, And friendly hand: perchance he may extend it, Although Passato's name be little known. Enter Cornelio and Dalmasso. Cor. I pant for it!âthe earth is made the sun, While the bright anniversary of our Order Spreads luminous gold; and magic masquerade Fills the chang'd world and gives us all new parts! Dal. A traveller!âand, methinks, no common man? Cor. He wears his soil'd mantle with a kind of grace; Not courtly, but still graceful. Come you from far? Pass. (advancing.) From Carthage, sir: my father was of Florence; But this is my first visit. Cor. Ah! the loadstone That stirs your metal hath sure influence: St Etienne's festivalâis't not, I pray you? Pass. No, sir, indeed. I am a lonesome man, And find most pleasure in my loneliness. My life has passed in study midst old ruins, And monuments of glories now no more. Dal. Art thou a sculptor, then? Pass. 'Tis my best hope. Cor. Thy name, sir? Pass. An obscure oneâdel Passato. Dal. Methinks I once did hear Duke Cosmo praise thee For a small medallion of some dying saint. Thou'lt find an open passage to the court. Pass. I thank you, sir; but as I ne'er was sanguine, Sad disappointment seldom reaches me: I live in truce with fate, and we are friends. Yet am I grateful to you for the greeting. Cor. Nay, you are hard of faith in courts! Pass. I am, sir. Cor. This is rude bitterness: we are of the court! Pass. Let me entreat your pardon, and receive it: I knew not that. Cor. Do not our vestments show it? Know'st not kingfishers' plumes from hides of sheep? Pass. I did not note them: ye are of good form; Not perfect, certainly, yet outlin'd well; Your pardon, then, that I did only follow My natural bent of sight. Dal. The Duke shall hear That you're in Florence: he hath ever shown A high and practical sympathy with genius. The studious prince, Giovanni, we shall join Within an hour;âyou'll bear us company? He is a prince whom you will love and honour For fine acquirements and demeanour sweet: His virtues win all hearts. Cor. Except his brother's. Pass. Wherefore the exception, pray you? Dal. 'Tis an old story, Which every teller varies to his mind, And ne'er relates it twice alike. Pass. Then might I Invent a version for myself? Dal. You might, sir. Some say that Garcia's coldness to his brother Is but a crystal from Giovanni's ice, And hence congealment mutual is preserved; While others, and myself among them, deem That Garcia's envy of his brother's worth Makes fret-work o'er his early-winter'd heart, And no bland gushes leap to proffer'd love. Pass. Doth then Giovanni love him? Cor. Nay, how should he? Think you the vine-pole to the north blast yearns? Who can love hatred? Pass. They both hate alike? Dal. Not so; nor can we know it by such name: Each would do aught, right glad, to serve the other, Save by companionship. Both have high spirits, And both peculiar natures. Many say That Cosmo favours much his elder born; Forwards his studies with especial eye To some great destiny; that from their cradles He show'd this preference,âto the Duchess' care Leaving young Garcia ever. But 'tis prov'd He was unaptâopposed to all instruction; Hating to learn, yet anxious to be taught; Wishing to know by inspiration: in fact, A wilful child left to his waywardness. His too fond mother, thinking he was slighted, Pamper'd, until too late to give him check; And thus he hath grown up. Cor. Grown up!âwhy, scarcely: He hath no tint of hair upon his chin; No sign of manhood yet in dress or bearing! Dal. From his fair face his mother still looks out, And smiles around his mouthâor, rather, sighs. Pass. Whate'er the cause that parts these brothers' hearts, With all the trifling acts and circumstance That have combin'd against their natures thus, Manhood will doubtless chase the feud to air,â E'en as a giant, waking from dark dreams, Looks up and sees the perfect heavens above, And hails their steadfast glory. Dal. It may be so. Yet do I doubt young Garcia: he is strange; He makes no friends, laughs seldom, loves few sports, And latterly hath wander'd quite alone, Just like a lover, or some ruin'd man. Cor. No gallantries of his are yet recorded, And ladies soon will doom him for a monk. If's blood can't rise beneath Duke Cosmo's eye, Why not midst country maidens havoc make, And cause a strange commotion of all tongues, As when a kite above a farm-yard soars? Dal. You recommend a high morality: It should be set to music. Cor. For the organ? Pass. (calmly.) Ay, with the devil, sir, to fill your pipes, And turn your leaves, and kiss you in the face! Cor. Ahem!âlet's haste, for Prince Giovanni now Hath left Chiostro's study. Dal. (to Pass.) He will receive you. Cor. (aside.) My wit chills, near this marble-minded man. Pass. I like young Garcia. Dal. You would say Giovanni; The model of all excellence! Pass. I doubt not. Yet I was thinking of the younger son. Dal. This is some mood of eccentricity! Cor. Is't not the young prince Garcia standing there, Before Lorenzo's bust? His back is tow'rds us. Dal. Yes, it is he: this way he comes. Now, sir, Will you accompany us? Pass. Please you, I'll stay. I shall be grateful if you'll introduce me. Dal. 'Tis true he hath his mother's ear, which oft Is close to the Duke'sâbut Garcia will not serve you. Cor. He cares not for the Arts. Pass. It is his loss. Cor. And hates a chisel as a learned tongue; Or as a nose hates frost, and frost a thaw. Pass. He is a youth I like to look upon. Enter Garcia. Cor. Bright skies attend my lord; give you good day! Gar. (smiling.) I thank the skies: sometimes they frown upon us, But they are ever great and lofty. Cor. My lord, That is most true; albeit our hopes below Are oft as flat as a pond. Gar. Drown not thy soul, Like a blind whelp: hast thou no birthright, sir? [Pointing upwards. Dal. We joy to see you walking in the sun: 'Tis not your constant pleasure. Gar. Nor my pride: But for your courteous greeting take my thanks, Full measured by your own sincerity. Shall I enquire the stranger's rank? Dal. A sculptor: Luigi del Passato. Gar. He is welcome: The Duke, sir, and my brother, will receive Your visit graciously. Cor. (aside to Dal.) Now we'll take wing, And leave the chisel to our royal flint! Dal. My lord will pardon our abrupt departure: We have a summons. Gar. Cavaliers, good day! [Exeunt Cornelio and Dalmasso. (To Pass.) They shun me, for they are my brother's friends, And go by instinct: follow them, I pray; The favor of Giovanni best will serve you. Pass. I am no hasty man. I'll e'en stay here. Gar. Thou canst know little of the Court, to give This preference to me. All who seek favour, Appreciation, and due patronage, Make interest with Giovanni: they do right. He hath most brilliant talentsâI have none; Gentle and courteous isâ'tis plain I'm neither. So many say this, I suppose 'tis true. Pass. I'll wait my time. Gar. I deem thou'dst wait for ever In any other Court, by such neglect. Pass. Those gentlemen were courtiers,âso they said? Gar. And truly. Sir, I will be free with you, For you do show a nature undisguis'd, And act as if alone in the wide world. Pass. I speak my thoughts, young sir, and calmly stand On the vast slab of Time: a mere clay figure, And not a pendent gem. Gar. Those gentlemen Are called Dalmasso and Cornelio. The first, a man of sense; yet I dislike him: He reasons and retreats; he bows too low, And studies chemistry to please the Duke. The other hath a wit beyond himself; Its spirit uttering things he knows not whence, Why, how, or whither; a rich-fancied fool: His vanity revolves around a button, Wherein he suns and glasses his fond face. Pass. Leave him his happiness: why shake the flower Within whose cup of dew the butterfly Beholds his plumage, and is blest? The earth Hath pleasures varied to its motley crowd; Let us not interfere. Gar. Sir, will you walk with me? Your conversation throbs about my heart Like new-born hopes: I seem at last to have found A book which I would read most seriously. Come, you shall be my tutor and my friend. Garcia and Luigi del Passato: Enter, to them, Dalmasso and Giovanni. Gio. Garcia, 'twere well if thou'd'st bethink thyself That youth's bright spring-tide tends to autumn's shade, And manhood, to be high and honourable, Needs preparation. Gar. Sir, what moves your mind To this precocious lecture? Gio. Your life's waste. Gar. My elder by three years! Go, grey-green sir! Your olive-leaf of wisdom needs more sun. I cannot, and I will not bear your rod! Gio. Who is this new acquaintance? Gar. He is my friend: That is enough, good brother. Pass. Thank you, sir! Gio. Found in the streetsâthe friend of half an hour! Rude boy, thou must be taught to know thyself, Ere thou can'st chooseâa friend. Gar. Peace, sir! Dal. My lords! Gar. Am I to walk, talk, think as you directâ Eat, drink, and sneeze in your approved good fashionâ Sleep in your attitude, and dream your dream? I'd rather make my bed upon a wasp's nest! Gio. Thou dost already; and thro' the spleenful day Bear'st it about, as madmen play with fire. Gar. As elder brothers play! Dal. My lords! my lords! Gar. This gentleman and I will leave your wisdom. Gio. Go then, thy way: feed folly, and find shame! [Exeunt at opposite sides. SCENE II. Public Gardens.âEnter Zacheo, disguised as a Friar. Zach. I know not if this disguise hangs friar-wise upon me; but one thing I know, I feel hugely uncomfortable in it! I like to have my limbs freeâfull play for the sword-armâan uncovered browâno impediment to the advancing of the leg sinuouslyâand ample scope throughout for every action that becomes a man and a pirate! Whereas, my limbs seem to belong to my habiliments rather than to myself, since I have no proper use of them; and the captain of the boldest crew that ever ground a blade by torch-light, while their black galley rode like a sleeping cormorant over the billows, is now as much in his own way as an armadillo in a bag! 'Sdeath! I cannot endure this much longer; and yet I must bear it too,âat least until I can discover what is in agitation against us. This city-hatched storm has been brewing over our decks some time, and has occasionally broke out in a squall, and dispersed several of our gallies: some have been captured, and the crews hung up like dried fish in the sun; but now the Duke seems resolved to drive us off the coast of Tuscany for ever. My best line of trade seems in a fair way of being destroyed during the reign of this troublesome Prince, who will not let things go on in their natural course. Pirates have existed in all countries from time immemorial: we are as natural to the sea as her tides, or the moon,âbless her old white face! How could there be spring or neap without us? Ah! some pretty women! I'll speak to them under favour of my cassock. Enter Berta and Christina. Bert. This way, Christineâfollow me;âthere! under that old trunk, standing in its bed of golden moss and long grass, we shall find the sweetest flowers, nestling out of sightâWhat a strange-looking man! Zach. (aside.) By Mahomet! and they are very pretty! I wish we were near the sea-coast! Chris. It's only some begging friar. Bert. A begging nonsense!âhe's much more likely to take than askâand yet he is frocked something the colour of a friar. Chris. He is in preparation to speak with us, as I live!âshall we run away? Bert. I don't know, Christine. Chris. Shall we, eh? Bert. No; not yetâwe'll e'en hear first what he says; and we can laugh in his face very prettily, and then run away. Zach. (aside.) Should I begin with a benediction, or a compliment?âmy soul's in a fog!âan' we were but near the sea-coast! Chris. What's the matter with him? Zach. (advancing.) Soft blessed ladiesâ Bert. and Chris. (laughing.) Soft ladies! Zach. (aside.) They laugh at me!âDo the hoof and tail-tip peep out, Catholic-fashion, at the hem o' this holiness? Bert. (aside.) Poor man! Chris. Couldst confess thyself fully in the ear of such a black-beard? Zach. (aside.) By Allah! but I'll get my manhood afloat. (aloud.) Handsome young womenâthat is, fair daughters of Florence!âthese fresh-favoured gardens owe all their sweetness and bright life to your breath and presence. When you are gone, they will be no better than shingles and sea-weed! Bert. Well, what a pleasant man! Some of these monks have wherewithal to set themselves off. Good day to the holy father!âgive your Carmelite reverence good day! Zach. (aside.) My reverence! Chris. Has your piety lately arrived in Florence? Zach. Ahem!â(They take me for the Pope, just arrived.) I laugh with joy to behold such sweet happy facesâthey are so very different from the sad crew of nuns I am used to. Bert. The nuns he is used to! Chris. Then you think, holy friar, that we are not like unhappy nuns? Zach. As unlike as a woman is to a mermaid (advancing towards Berta). You have a lovely warm complexion of morning roses, which mermaids have not,âtheir cheeks being always of a cold twilight hue; you have hair as bright as the finest gold I ever handled (touches it; she retreats a pace); while their's is only a stream of long tearful grass; you have very pretty feet, and, I make no doubt, with proper legs to match; and you are totally deficient in the sweeping rudder of a green scaly tail! Chris. and Bert. Oh! Bert. I am very glad to hear your piety say so. Chris. What a very strange sort of a friar! Zach. In short, you are as sweet a vessel as ever pirate would wish to set foot upon. Bert. and Chris. Oh! what says he? Zach. I only meant that there were such fellows as pirates in the world, who would give their ears to have met you near the coast. Bert. Ah, marry would they!âor anywhere else. Zach. I begin to forget myself as I look upon you! Chris. What a confession for a confessor! Bert. (to Chris.) See you not the wretch is making love to me! I shall complain angrily to my husband, you wicked holy father, an' you talk in this fashion so freely! Zach. No, noâyou won't. Chris. But we will though! we'll both enlighten our husbands. They are gentlemen of note and station about the Duke's court, and they'll have you sent back to your monastery with your nose cut off! Bert. And your naughtiness might think yourself very fortunate that it was no worse. Zach. (aside.) Oho! the court of the Grand Duke! now shall I get my soundings at small cost of time, and learn what preparations are under weigh against the gallant band of Barbary corsairs, to circumvent our natural living. Bert. (aside.) ChristineâO, an' I dare do't? Chris. (aside.) Dare what? Bert. Let him exhale love-sighs! 'Twould be rare pleasantry. Chris. Yes, yes, in sooth! And what say you, should I let him make love to me also; you not seeming to see't? Bert. And we will both pretend, besides, to be, in a sort, not displeased with his ugliness? Chris. We willâwe will. Bert. Ahem!âGood day, holy friar. Chris. We bear your reverence no malice,âheaven forgive us! Zach. May I not walk a pace in the same path with two such lovely gentlewomen? Bert. Yes; as the father is strange in Florence, we'll e'en show him the nearest pathway out of the gardens. Zach. And your husbands are stars of the Duke's court? Bert. Yesâand they're out of sight just now. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An Apartment in the Ducal Palace.âThe Duchess, Ippolita, and Giovanni. Duch. Cease then at once, Giovanni, and for ever, This your ungentle feud. Your brother loves you At heart,âI'm sure he does, although his pride And this sad habit of your early years Restrain his feelings: give but yours free way, And he'll receive you in wide-open'd arms! Giov. Mother, our thoughts, our studies and our sports, So long have been divided, or oppos'd, Methinks it scarce can be as you desire, And I myself could wish. Duch. Join then your thoughts; And teach your brother to regard your studies, By sharing them! Giov. This were an arduous task. Duch. Nought is too arduous for an anxious heart. Begin by joining in some favorite sports; Range on the same side, win or lose together: The rest will gently follow. Ippo. Pray you, do! Your noble mother reasons well and kindly: Why should two generous natures be oppos'd, Or keep such chilling distance? Giov. Fair Ippolita, I would 'twere otherwise. Duch. Then make it so! Thou art the elder-born, and first shouldst offer The hand of reconciling brotherhood; And let me tell thee, son, it ill becomes The piety which else thy conduct proves, To live at enmity that might be peace. Giov. Madam, I grieve; but what wouldst have me do? You know his pitch of spirit, and how wayward: My spirit is more tranquil, but no humbler. Duch. Oh! talk not thus; maintaining this wrong cause Of enmity that knows no origin,â Such is its age: 'tis time it should be buried. Giov. Ah, if it were, the order I'd reverse Of final service,âpraying it ne'er might rise. Duch. I thank my Maker for my son's good heart! All will be wellâye shall be reconcil'd. Ippo. Sir, you have bless'd your mother with kind words; You must not be too slow in the fulfilment. Duch. To-morrowâyes, Giovanni, on the morrow, Join in some pastime with young Garcia; Say you will hunt with him! Giov. Nay, not so soon: St Etienne's festival intervenes,âits star E'en now informs each gem o' the Ducal crown. Duch. Ye can return in time: were't but an hour, Yet go, my son! Ippo. Do not thus hesitate! Do not refuse, Giovanni! Giov. I will go. Duch. Thanks to my son! Your word is pass'dâadieu! [Exit Duchess. Giov. How hastily she's gone!âmethinks this promise Was made unwisely? Ippo. Ye can return betimes. Giov. Your intercession, dear Ippolita, Dispers'd my reasoning, and I e'en must go. But were it only that I thus shall place A space of earth, an interval of hours, Between our loves, more than my usual loss, I fain would break my word. Ippo. Speak not of love. Ah, should I e'er have listen'd to thy vows, Or to my heart's fond promptings? Giov. Wherefore not? The Duke will sanction it. Ippo. It is too much For thee to promise, and for me to hope! Have I requited well the generous hand Of regal Cosmo, who beneath his roof With fatherly protection thus hath cherish'd The orphan of a ruin'd nobleman; That, like a secret serpent at the base Of an alabaster column, I should twine, And in a gradual circle rise to mar The artist's best design with strange intrusion! Oh! prince of Florence, I have acted ill: But I will break this matter to the Duchess, Implore forgiveness, and as she directs So will I act. Giov. Thou griev'st my very soul, Most dear Ippolita! I pray thee breathe No word as yet: all may be very well, But I have reasons for a brief delay. (Aside.) My heart misgives me of my father's purpose, And much I dread to questionâyet I must. (Aloud.) Meantime, sweet love, I'll join this idle hunt With Garcia in the woods;âlook not so sad! Ippo. I'm glad to hear thou'lt do so. Giov. Let me kiss That slow tear lingering down thy pallid cheek: There is no error in our mutual love. [Kisses her. Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Ducal Library.âCosmo, seated with Chiostro. Cosmo. The grandeur of Antiquity uplifts Each soul, whose natural energies expand In space sufficient for its by-gone worlds. Greece in its infancy, and unborn Rome, Trac'd thro' their glorious rise and branchings vast, As tho' we'd watch'd seeds set in paradise Take root, and then inherit all the sun; Breed thoughts and visions, such as Time himself Might pause remorseful o'er his scythe, to scan. [They rise, and advance. With deep-set interest have I listen'd to thee; And do account myself most fortunate In the high service rendered to my mind, As to Giovanni's, by so learned a man. Chios. Your Highness' sympathy with all my labours, Large as the favours I have else receiv'd, Is to my heart most grateful. Cosmo. Now, Chiostro, 'Tis fit thine office in the Ducal palace Thou shouldst resign. Since thou art valuable, I must not longer hoard thy merit thus: The Florentine Academy hath need Of one like thee:âI place thee at its head; And this thy present office we shall give Unto some scholar who may be in want, Having, by passion for the wisdom past, Forgot all present means wherewith to live. I've such a one in view; and much I fear Blind time owns many. Chios. For the individual, 'Twere well if men, so minded, first did think Of their own state; but then, the general wealâ Cosmo. Would starve: 'twould make the world change places with them, In all save merit. Chios. May your Highness live To a sublime old age; while secret prayers, Pour'd forth in cloister'd shades and lone retreats, Bless your bright nameâascendant o'er the tomb! I will forthwith prepare to do your pleasure In my new office, and direct with care The Laurentinian studies. Cosmo. They will prosper: The best example precepts best can give. Please you, send here my son. [Exit Chiostro. It is a change That brings the eagle-circles of the mind Down from their cloudy range, to belt the earth: But Sovereigns must be statesmen. Yet, not only Is this mere policy and cold design Of aggrandizement: it is said she's fair, And with her love Giovanni will be blest. Enter Giovanni. Thanks for this haste!âwhy, thou look'st pale, my son; But I have somewhat that should make the blood Tingle thine ears, and flush thine orient cheek, Like to a Persian's at his morning prayer! Listen, Giovanni. Giov. Sir, I do, seriously. Cosmo. Thou know'st the present stature of my power; My precedence o'er all Italia's States, And the far influence thence by me possess'd, Did not fall whole into my opening hands! I sat not playing with toy-coronets, In calm assurance, near my nurse's chair, Of a large birthrightâwaiting for my growth; But, when of years sufficient, forth I stept, Seiz'd what was mine from rebel parricides, Blinded conspiracy with lightning-shafts, In its gross ashes sowing triumphs wide, And made my realm expand, with constant care, By energy in peace more than in war. Though now we flourish, wherefore not increase, And plant tall cedars in a foreign land, Progressively to rise and bow their heads To this domain, whoe'er may govern it? Thou art the medium of our present need: 'Tis for thine own high fortune, more than mine, Since I may live not till the full result. Giov. Sir, I do owe you reverence, love and duty, And trust I shall approve the manifold debt With glad obedience. What are your commands? Cosmo. Briefly, my son;âI have a fix'd design, Which to accomplish I will strain all means Consistent with my dignity. [He pauses. Giov. (aside.) My knees Can scarce sustain the substance of this pause: It crushes like death's shadow! Cosmo. It is thy union With an Imperial house. Giov. (aside.) Then am I crown'd With iron wretchednessâthron'd on despair! Cosmo. Thou art confounded!ânay, what ails my son? Think'st thou I contemplate to outrage nature By an unfit alliance; youth with age, Or thy most fair proportions with some form That's odious to each sense? The youngest daughter Of the Imperial Ferdinand is now In beauty's prime; and were she of less state, Had long since been the sweet domestic goddess Of some devoted youth, chosen from a host! Giov. 'Tisâ'tis a serious thoughtâ Cosmo. (smiling.) Requiring time?â Thou dost receive intelligence of splendour With a most leaden, unresponsive heart! But come, sir, come; we'll to the Picture Gallery: 'Tis the serene dominion of high minds; Or wouldst thou rather the Botanic Gardens, Where old physicians, like arm-folded shades, Brood o'er defeated graves, and sometimes smile At the expectant darkness? Come, Giovanni: Anon we'll of the Princess further speak. [Exeunt. SCENE V. A Gallery in the Ducal Palace.âEnter Garcia. Gar. Sweet is the breath of morning in the woods, Wherein, midst rapturous silence, lone we stand, As tho' we had but stept from dream to dream. Oh, when my couch is wet with blissful tears, Again I view them in the glistening grass, And know them shed for lov'd Ippolita! I seldom now can rove with her alone, As we were wont: Giovanni's varied talents Amuse her mind; but I will strive to please her Soon as he's gone: and since my mother hints That high alliances for him are sought, Let him be crown'd at once, so he but cease To talk so oft with our sweet foster-sister. She loves us both as brothers: 'tis not long That I have known my soul's ascendant star Burn'd high above a brother's level hopes; Yet sure I always felt her more than sister? But were I seated now with her alone In some green arbour of dim loveliness, How hard to frame in words the thousand things Which I should yearn to pour into her ear, And in one minute tell her love's whole life! Enter Duchess and Ippolita. [They pause.] Duch. Look youâ'tis Garcia! Is it not most strange, The scorner of all studies thus so oft With serious brow should root himself in thought? Ippo. Indeed 'tis strange. Gar. (abstractedly.) How hath it multiplied All memories! Duch. Soft! he speaks! Ippo. What said he, madam? Gar. Is not the sun, heaven's altar, always burning An incense that illumines space and Timeâ Gilding his path o'er graves, and his grey hairs, For ever old, yet in his infancy! O, star-light! be thou my temple! Duch. Hist! he is praying. Gar. And let the priestess be Ippolita! Ippo. What says he? [They come forward.] Gar. (confused.) And my motherâfor the priestesses. Duch. It is a novel prayer which thou hast made, Dear Garcia; yet all prayers are good alike, When steep'd in holy feeling. Ipp. We do thank you For the high office you have given us Within your temple! Gar. Would it might be so! Duch. Since then we stand so fair in his regard, We'll crave a boon of Garcia? Ippo. Ere it cool. Gar. Think'st me a cloud, or a wind? Ipp. I hope thou'lt change For once? Join pastimes with thy brother, Since thou dost shun his studies. Duch. Say thou wilt? Gar. Pastimes! what pastimes?âbotany and building, Blowpipes, and telescopes to insult the stars,â Call you these pastimes? Duch. Nay, you are wayward now: You mock me most unkindly. Gar. Honour'd lady, And dearest mother, how can we join in this? For while he studies to reclaim men's souls, I study hawking; or perchance I wander With mine own thoughts. Ipp. Sure they are loving thoughts? Gar. They are: but mark!âmy brother loves the cloister; I love the study of the silent fields, And boundless heavens full of nameless hopes, As he the library and thoughts of books: How can we join? Duch. See, see how thou mistak'st! I spoke of fields: oh! I should joy to see Thee with Giovanni make the forest ring While ye did hunt together! Wilt thou go? Gar. Did he propose it? Duch. 'Tis his ardent wish. Gar. With me? Duch. With thee. Gar. Why then, with all my heart! Duch. Ah! said I not soâsaid I not, he would! Garciaâdear boyâthou giv'st my soul fresh wings: The Duke will kiss my hands, for they have brought Our sons to clasp each other's. Ho! within there! Send wine unto the falconerâtell the huntsman To choose his hounds best trained to pin the boar, And let the Ducal clarions blithely sound: The Princes hunt to-morrow with the dawn! [Clarions sound a hunting march outside, as all retire. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Hall in the Ducal Palace.âEnter Ippolita. Ipp. It is scarce day-break; sure, they are not gone? I heard but now the baying of the hounds I' the hazy court-yard, and their keepers' voices, With jar of chains and the shrill cry of hawks? Giovanni has been closetted with the Dukeâ I have not seen him since, nor have I slept; But I will know the worst, whate'er it be. Enter Giovanni, in a hunting dress. Giov. Ippolita! Ipp. Oh, I have passed a night Of feverish thought! Giov. Then wherefore hast thou left Thy couch, love! at this chill blue hour of dawn? Ipp. What said the Duke?âlast night thy mother told me Important matters quickened in her mind, Touching thy future course: I could not trust My heart to question her? Giov. Cosmo hath soughtâ Ipp. Sought what? Giov. When I return thou shalt learn all,â But Garcia waits me now beyond the gates: My word, thou know'st, is pass'd. Ipp. Tell me at once! I can bear anything but such suspense. Giov. Then hear the wind sigh thro' this blighted tree, Words that will blight thee too! Ipp. All is explainedâ Cosmo hath chosen thee some noble bride! That fate oft rent my pillowâand I feel it With greater anguish than a sudden blow, Which with a stunning mitigation falls. Giov. The daughter of the Emperor Ferdinand. Ipp. Thou'rt free to do their bidding. I will retire. Giov. No, noâIppolita! Ipp. With thee I'll leave My heart; and for the rest, which some call âwoman,â It shall be buried in fit solitude. Giov. That solitude I'll share, if that the Duke Command obedienceâbut he'll not command When I shall tell him of our sea-deep love. Ambitious as he is, he hath a feeling That's greater than ambition,â'tis his justice, His magnanimity, his innate grandeur Of soul! He shall know all. Ipp. 'Tis then my part To act with fortitude. Oh! Prince of Florence, Receive the thanks of a devoted woman For thy most generous love, thus proved sincere: Forgive my courageâdo not deem it coldnessâ But the poor orphan whom thy father's bounty Hath saved from ruin, ne'er will mar his hopes By wedding with his son. Then fare thee well!â And all the blessingsâ [Exit Ippolita. Giov. Blessings on one who's cursed, Alight but on a poisoned soil, and perish! Yet shall the Duke know all; then will I prove My best obedience, acting as he deems right. My father is in all things great: his nature Owns a vast soul of beauty, grace and power, That, like the archangel's breath, might cover earth, And give man's blood a purer atmosphere. [Exit. SCENE II. Outskirts of the City.âEnter Garcia, Cornelio, Dalmasso, Cavaliers and Huntsmen; with falcons and boar-spears. Gar. There's oft with power an equal indolence: How somnolent the lion, or the form Of vast Alcides pondering o'er his club, And serious without thought!âwhy, dew-damp lords! We're up before Apollo! Cor. Where is the prince Giovanni? Gar. He's, perchance, asleep in's bed. Has he been roused? Dal. He has, my lord. Gar. Then, doubtless, With the first sense of the raw morning air He has turned himself just to deliberate, And now is dreaming of a noble chase. Cor. As hungry poets frame new worlds with words To multiply this hunting and eating life. I'll go and wake him. Gar. Cease thy cannibal wit. Dal. I will accompany you to 'tend the prince. Gar. He's here: of late he hath not used these sports, But with Chiostro sat up half the night. We have not waited long. Enter Giovanni. Giov. Your pardon, brotherâI have delayed you much. Gar. A minute scarcely: we are glad you're come. The day is favourableâclear and cold: Let's to the fields, beginning life afresh! Gio. I shall be glad to do so. Dal. Thou look'st pale: The air, my lord, doth seem too keen for you? Gio. I'm not quite well; but I shall mend apace, As my blood warms. Gar. (aside.) It is his hard consent, Gain'd by our mother, that doth make him ill: I fear 'tis so.âBrother, be frank with me! This pastime and my company suit not Thy habits, nor thy natural bent of mind: Clench not an odious task between thy teeth,â In all good feeling, if thou'dst rather stay, Say so, and take my hand before I go. Gio. I'll take it and go with thee. You mistake My cause of gloom. I've much that loads my mind. Gar. I apprehend. Gio. Dost thou? Gar. I think I do: (whispers.) In love already with the Emperor's daughter? Gio. Let us away! I will shake off this mood! Gar. Join then the chase with heart and hand and voice: Echoes shall ring as in some wooded isle Fresh peopled with the lusty savages! Sound, clarions!âfill the empty air, and lift The hoar grass on the heads of mountains old, Astonished at the wood-gods come once more! [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Ducal Library.âCosmo seated with a poor Scholar, who has been reading from a manuscript. Cosmo (rising.) I am well satisfied: thou'st writ a work, Fit chronicle of Asian conquerors. What gifts and fair dominions had been thine In those barbaric daysâmunificent, And oft as dangerousâwere hard to tell; But since on me devolves the grateful duty Of worth's reward, here is the best dominion Which I can offer thee:âbehold thy subjects! [He points to the library. Scho. It is a more than princely favour: it gives My heart a principality. Cosmo. I'm glad of't. But tell me, in thy course through those dark times, Where certitude of mightiest things oft hangs By one poor thread, hast thou not sometimes pampered Lean factsâthat trembled mid-deep in the graveâ Thus, with imagination, vivified? Scho. Not more, my liege, than hath Herodotus, Strabo in's later books, the elder Pliny, And all who've sought the unravelling of the past! Nor should we e'er conceal the principle, Since barren facts ne'er raised the moral world; And history would be earthy were it not For spiritual deductions. But where facts Could be authenticated, I have ever Given faithful record, and fair inference, Rearing a superstructure on just grounds. Cosmo. Thou tak'st a high position; bold, yet good. Read me once more the passage that describes Sesostris' death. Scho. Your Highness, it runs thus:â (Reads) âNot only was Sesostris worthy of being called the Mighty, in that his chariot rolled with intolerable power, like unto a second sun, over the vast tracts of Lybia and Ethiopia; in that he made the conquered Arabs uplift his name to a superstitious height, enthroned beside their ancient adorations; in that he made tributary the islands of the Red Sea, shaking the far-reaching lightning of his spears over the whole subjugated splendour of the East. Great as were the warlike deeds thus attributed to him, which seem at times to have dazzled his historiansâwanting a high severity of mindâinto glorious allegories and fables, where the extreme of admiration ends in smiles; Sesostris is worthy of a more imperishable fame. In this barbaric age he dealt mercifully with the fallen nations; in this barbaric age he ever strove to advance the noblest arts and sciences, and the progress of humane philosophy. Cosmo. I like thine estimate of fame: proceed! Scho. But now Sesostris approached the last degree of that orbit which endureth no second revolution of its body. After so many nations conquered; so many potent Kings made subjects of his sceptre; so many cities and temples erected; and the periodical exuberance of Nilus checked, mastered, and applied according to his designs; Sesostris found himself in the presence of Old Age! Pain was opposed to infirmity; diseases environed, and his faculties deserted him; he would have looked abroad for comfort and relief, but he had become blind. His children began to conspire for his throne; his friends fled from his bed-side to feast with them; his bodily existence became burdensome, loathsome, and a mere sea-cave of misery for the wreck of his mind; and with his last energy in both, he therefore destroyed himself. Cosmo. Thou read'st a fearful moral to great kings. But doth his end detract Sesostris' fame? Scho. With deference to your Highness, I think not. All that had made him great was gone: moreover, Assassination might have cut him off. Cosmo. We will discuss this question at our leisure. Scho. I hold myself your Highness' grateful debtor. [Exit Scholar. Cosmo. If princes reason'd deeply on this life, Its cloud-like changes and sharp accidents, Subject as worms before the crown-pav'd paths Where Fate with iron foot-step blind-fold strides; Or seeing, joys to crush our misplac'd pride: If we but measur'd glory's transient life With the death-chamber where all earth-born power Struggles for moments, as the breaking chain Swings o'er Eternity; should we not haste Our course to mend, nor dare to govern ill? I've made my crown despotic,âwas that right? The old republic close collected now, A ball within my handâbut thus, alone Of all the states, from France and Spain preserv'd! Severe the means; the end must justify, And spread enlarged, usurious recompense. Since I hold rule, I must first rule myself: Sternly I've done itâsternly will hold on; Nor passion's self shall shake my balanc'd soul, Thus with strong heart-felt justice counterpois'd. Enter an Officer. Offi. I bring despatches for your Highness. Cosmo. Whence? Offi. Straight from the coast. Cosmo. Have my directions prov'd Effective, in dispersion of the corsairs? Offi. My liege, not yet; but we have trac'd their chief Up to the city. Cosmo. Is he then in Florence? Offi. He is, your Highness. Cosmo. 'Tis some daring plan. I thank you:âstay, sirâwe have met before? Offi. In the Siennese wars, so please your Highness, A small troop I commanded. Cosmo. Ay, and bravely! Your merit, sir, has too long been o'erlook'd: Accept promotion as apology, For I have wrong'd you much. Offi. Your Highness' pardon: I did not doubt your favour at fit time, Believing I deserv'd it. Cosmo. Speed you well, sir. [Exit Officer. Now must Giovanni hasten from our court, Soon as St Etienne's festival is o'er, And seek the favour of the Pope in Rome, Who in such estimation holds our name He feigns himself a kinsman o' the Medici: Thence to Segovia, where King Philip now Dreams in his flower-crown'd villa. Soon my son Will, by his talents, and his manners, fram'd Of such sweet seriousness, his bland discourse, And sterling worth, their best regard obtain: Then, with those powerful friends our suit to aid, With fitting retinue, as prince of Florence, Unto the Emperor shall he speed to woo His youngest daughter's hand. Where is Giovanni? I do remember me: the Duchess' plan To reconcile the boys, and set at rest Their causeless variance, ere Giovanni leave The city, is a wise and motherly thought; Else might the canker into manhood eat And rot affection's natural designs. [He seats himself, with a book. SCENE IV. A Street.âEnter Chiostro and Macchietti. Mac. I have primed a large palette for the occasion, that would do St Etienne's heart good to look upon; and I have got half a score of canvasses as tight as drums; then, when the glorious feast is at its heightâthe censers burningâthe wine flowingâthe noble garments falling in redundant folds, just as happy accident disposeth themâand the jewels raying forth from the women's hairâI shall fix my shoulder behind a dark pillar, and make such sketches! Say you,âsay you, Chiostroâshall I not get rare sketches? Chi. 'Twill be an opportunity most favourable, methinks. Mac. What is become of the young princes? Gone a-hunting?âodd time to go a-hunting!âupon the eve of such a festival? Chi. 'Tis at the desire of the Duchess; and with the Duke's approval. Their distance towards each other never seems to have had any especial grounds, and 'tis good time it should now cease for ever. Mac. So it isâso it is. Here come two of the seven plagues of Egypt! Chi. Our wives, I opine? Enter Berta and Christina, running. Ber. Oh, here they areâthe old books and picturesâ our two liege night-caps! Chi. (aside.) A liege night-cap! O, Learning! is this the figure thou mak'st in thy wife's imagination? Ber. We so rejoice to ha' found you! Chri. We are so glad! Mac. (to Chris.) I dread the bright quest and query of thine eye!âdost want wherewith to buy some fresh adornment for the outside of thy little head? Chri. Twenty ducatsâno more. Ber. As for me, I want all things new! Chi. Spare these grey locks. Ber. Nay, that will Iâquiet man! Mac. I must away to prepare! (To Chris.) Has't been i' the painting-room? Chri. No, sir; oh no! Mac. Mass! you have!âI see half a fresh-painted eye on the tip of your fore-finger and smell rare oil in your drapery folds; and I, moreover, see my palette cast on the ground, with its magic face downwards! Ber. Out on such a face! Chri. What a fuss it makes about its painting-place! âwould I had never entered! Marry! what a life has been for meâsitting so oft stock-still, for the hands, arms, legs, toes, busts and backs, of other women! An' I had but known what it was to marry a painter! Mac. And I what 'twas to marry one who has no love for the art! Chri. Help us!âis'nt one painter enough in the family;âlove you not enough for both of us, sir? I want nine ducats? Mac. For what possible farcicality? Chri. For what did I marry you, think you, sir?â Not to sit, lean, lie, or stand each day for the fingers, toes, backs, legs, wingsâ Mac. Oh! Chri. Besides draperies!âFarcical, forsooth!âart not always buying dingy old painted cobwebs, not worth a candle, and at any price!âSweet husband! lighten thy heavy heart of these ducats. Mac. WellâI submit my purse-neck to thy execution. Chri. St Etienne smile on our fine arts! Ber. (to Chios.) Most dear! Chi. (aside.) This have I sometime expected. Ber. I would fain have fourteen of the same. Chi. Nay, I must not. Ber. Must not!âwho saith it?âwho, when your own wife knoweth you must? Chi. (gravely.) There's none so bold:âI would there were. Ber. Must not!âDo'st tell me this, when scarce two days since, there was forced through the porch a square stack of the mouldiest old tomes that ever thy rubbishmania collected! Chi. (sighing.) Mania for rubbish! Ber. Marry, and what else are they, I should like to learn? Chi. Humph!âthereof I entertain some doubt: thou wouldst not like to learn. Ber. Well, 'tis most true, I should notâ'art ever so right:âlend me fourteen ducats for a while? Chi. The omens are inauspicious. Enter Luigi del Passato. Ber. Look you at this best-behaved gentlemanâfor those who worship imagesâthat ever entered your calm house, and hear what he will say. Sir, could my husband lend money to anybody so safely as to his wife? Pass. Of a truth not, lady: the safety is in flight. Ber. Hear you that conclusion? Chi. Socrates insinuateth the axiom that, among women, no man can escape his destiny: I therefore consent. Ber. 'Art indeed a scholar now, to some purpose. Christina! happy Festival!âsee'st thou how this promise outweighs thine? Why did'st not persist more intemperately, sweet? [Exit Macchietti hastily. Chri. Most sweet husband?âhe's gone! Pass. It does not become a scholar to expend much money for dresses. Ber. Eh!âout on these calm, cold-featured men; you shall never know what they really think. Come Christina! [Exeunt Berta and Christina. Chi. Poets often feign miseries, and eloquent writers do commonly, for the sake of a climax in favour of the cause they would enhance, insist upon various things as the most destructive to man's happiness; but for a real, practical, homefelt insurance of domestic disquiet and misery, nothing in this world of many troubles is so efficient as an unsympathising wife! Oh Learning! what art thou to a yard of silk! [Exit Chiostro. Pass. It is good for man to be alone. [Exit. SCENE V. A thick Forest. Enter Cornelio, Dalmasso, Cavaliers, and Hunters. Dal. It is most strange!âI know not how it chanc'd! We've lost the princes, 'tis a full hour ago! Cor. Not strange, methinks, amidst our hot pursuit Through such entangled mazes, whence look'd forth Right many a wood-born face with blood-shot eyes, That made us think of ourselves! 'Twas life 'gainst life; And death's a spiteful brute, as the monks say. Dal. Think of your Orderâbe not thus profane. Cor. Absolve us, all good cavaliers and monks! I'm lost in doubtâwho saw the princes last? Cav. The boar grew furious, when from out the thicket Where last he crouch'd, our dogs did riot him; But still he fled. Hunt. Don Garcia, with a spear, Press'd close upon his out-swell'd, panting flank! Dal. So did his noble brother; but that wolfâ Was't not a wolf that, at the moment, cross'd us? Hunt. It was. Cor. And in the fresh and fierce confusion We've lost the princes, and our sport to boot; For whither they are gone I cannot learn From this oracular Muse that sings in man. Cav. Perchance, they're not far distant: best wait here? Dal. The princes seem'd most ardent in the chase, Vying with each otherânot i' the sweetest mood; But hunting naturally excites the blood, And makes men, for the time, wild and ferocious As is the beast they hunt. Cav. Let us rest here! Cor. Rest is the wisdom learnt of useless actionâ Oh what a devil of a thorn is here! Dalmasso, what's the genus of a black-thorn? Dal. Oh, cease! cease! I've no mood. Cor. Pooh! pooh! they're safe. By searching ye oft lose; by sitting still Ye're found. My feet are sore and my joints ache: Let's to yon tree, and seated 'neath its boughs, Bring forth our wallets and beguile the time. All. Well said! well said! Dal. I would we had not lost them. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Another part of the Forest. Enter Giovanni and Garcia, breathless and excited. Gio. I say 'twas mine. Gar. 'Twas mine, sir! Gio. 'Twas my spear That thro' the haunches pierc'd him! Gar. Where's the boar? The savage hath escap'd us. Gio. I was close When you did cross me in your headlong blindness To make a random blow, and thus we lost him! 'Tis ever so with hot, misguiding haste! Gar. It was the wolf you smote. Gio. Mass! 'twas the boar! Gar. He sped this way. Look you at these moss'd trunks, Torn white with's tusks!âand here his hoofs with rage Have spurn'd rough trenches!âon these drooping leaves See the rank clotted foam! But he is gone! Gio. I hate thus to be foil'd!âseldom I use These idle gamesâand now I must be foil'd! Gar. I'm vex'd as youâbut we may find another. Gio. Nay, I'm fatiguedâdisgusted! Gar. Was't my fault? Gio. It wasâthou know'st it wasâor thou shouldst know! Gar. Mine!âhow? Gio. Assuredly. Gar. Why, brother, look you hereâ It was the wolf you smote, just as he sprang Into the thicket where the boar had rush'd! I know 'twas all confusion at the moment, But that I saw. Gio. Thou seldom see'st aright. Gar. So long thou'st been unpractis'd in these sports, 'Tis thou whose ardour doth mislead thine aim. 'Twas much the same when, three years since, we both Cast off our hawks: thou said'st 'twas thine that struck The cloud-borne game,âthe falconer said 'twas mine. Thy study's lamp breeds visions in thine eyes When i'the open air. Gio. 'Tis vanity And childish petulance that make thee blind! Gar. What made the falconer blind, then? Gio. Pshaw!âthy ducat. Gar. Thou'st learnt illiberal shiftsâthy Saint's a lawyer! Gio. Insolent boy! Gar. My senses are sure vouchers. Gio. Thy senses!âthey're as yet i' their swaddling-clothes! Gar. Is this the modesty you learn from books, And women so admire? Gio. Goâcease thy prattle! I'm vex'd and tir'd, and in no mood to bear it. Gar. Then, sir, go you! Gio. Do not provoke me, boy! Gar. The forest's wideâwhat care I for your mood? Return and cool, and seek instead of books Our mother's chamber, or Ippolita, And of her learn to sweeten your ill-temper. Gio. Ippolita!âwhat mean you? ha! what mean you? Dost taunt me with her name? Gar. Taunt you!âAh, no; She is too dear to meâtoo much respected, And too much lov'd, to use for any taunt. Gio. What's this!âthou lov'st her as thy foster-sister, Or as our mother loves her, or the Duke? Gar. More, more!â'tis a strange moment for the avowal. Gio. Thou'd'st love her as a wife, then? Gar. Ay, most truly!â But what is this to thee, that thus with eyes Staring and flaming, with a stiffening mouth, And working fingers, thou dost trembling stand? Gio. I love Ippolita! Gar. Thou! Gio. And sincerely! Nay more, she loves me better than her lifeâ Beyond her happiness! Gar. Can this be true? But what a cruel palterer must thou be, Knowing that thou'rt to wed another soon, Thus to seduce her love,âthus to rob me Of her first feelings! Oh, 'tis base!âmost base! Gio. Rail boy, no more! I cannot, will not, bear it! Give up thine idle thought, for she is mine! Gar. Thine!âidle thought!âwhy, what's thy studious thought? Hie to the Emperor's court and make your wayâ Strut i' the market, and there strike a bargain To set your sanctity on stronger bones! My idle thought!âI love her as my soul, And as the soul of all this Heaven above us! Gio. Unbearable!âfear not my sword's keen edge, But with the flat o' the blade I will chastise thee! [Draws. Gar. What! Gio. I shall beat thy words into loud cries, Scorning thy boyhood as thine insolence! Gar. Thou scarlet braggart! Gio. Thou shalt find, I will. Gar. Thou'd'st best not try it! [Draws. Gio. Insolent young villain! [They fight off. Enter Zacheo, from behind a tree. Zach. As fair a fight as I would wish to see! The younger one is down!âah! up again? His sword is brokenâhalf of it remains, And makes a fiery circle round both heads! 'Sdeath! 'tis a desperate bout!âhere they come reeling! I'll have no share in it. [Zacheo retreats. Re-enter Garcia, with Giovanni, who staggers, and leans upon his sword. Gar. What hast thou done? Gio. (faintly). Wrong, Garciaâwrongâand death must be the atonement. Gar. Death!âno, no! thou art not wounded deeply? Gio. Mortally! Gar. No!âit cannot, cannot be? [Supports him. Gio. I feel my life fast flowing into the graveâ The grass looks red and hazyâall's confusedâ And a sick atmosphere envelopes meâ A general shroud! [Sinks down. Gar. 'Tis but a passing faintnessâ Gio. It will passâ And Iâwith it. List to my parting words.â [Garcia kneels beside him. Bear my best blessing to Ippolita, Thus full of mine eternity:âthou'lt do it? Gar. I willâI will do anythingâmerciful God! Gio. If thou shouldst marry herâbe kind and lovingâ And tell our fatherâtell him from me, dear Garcia, That this unworthy end was the worst crimeâ If crime can be where thought was absentâlostâ Wherewith my conscience is oppress'd: farewell! [Dies. Gar. He is not dead!âhe is not surely dead? Giovanni, speak to meâspeak but one word! Make some faint signâthe leastâthat I may know A thread of life remains!âsave me from madness! [After a pause.] Yesâhe is surely deadâhe must be dead! No sleep was e'er like thisâno tranceâno fainting! Those white and rigid lipsâthose dreadful eye-balls, Turning me all to stone;âall but my soulâ Would that were stone too!âGod! make me a stone, Or make him animate!âthese unnatural limbsâ These root-cold fingersâfallen jawâthis hair Steaming the grassâall prove that Death is here; For every vital thing i' the universe Is quite unlike it! Whereâwhere shall I go! [Exit, wildly. Zacheo, coming forward. Zach. A mortal fightâa very desperate fight, And a right grievous one it seems to ha' been! In all my time I ne'er felt thus before! Death I can bearâbut who can bear remorse, Or such despair as shakes that boy to the soul? I hate to see itâdeath is nothing to it! I had a mind, just at the height o' the fray, To step between and beat their swords to earth; But prudence held me: 'troth! I've always found Meddling for good of others hurts one's self, And no thanks gain'd beside. Hist!âI'll steal off From my old forest bed-chamber to the city, Lest I be found and question'd of this deed; Which e'en might lead to many other questions. (Listening, and looking round.) How sharp the wind sings thro' the dead man's teeth! And jars mine, too, as coldly! Evening shades Creep o'er the quivering leaves. I almost fancy I see strange forms like Afrits and pale Gouls, Dodge round the dark trunks, while the air seems filling With faces of men slain at sea, and those Who sand-graves found ashore! Away! 'twas written! [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Outskirts of the Forest.âEnter Garcia. Gar. Thro' the wild silence of this savage forest I've wander'd with quick steps to shun the scene. I'm on the outskirts nowâwhere would I go? Where'er I turn, Giovanni's dying form Lies in my pathâand in my tingling ears Giovanni's dying words are still repeated! Where would I flyâunless into the grave? But wherefore?âfor I know not how 'twas done. He struck meâlung'd at meâwe foughtâhe fellâ How was't he got his death-wound? Oh vain thought! What can restore himâwhat can bring him back? Nothing!âfor he is deadâI left him deadâ And I must answer for it! Answer!âhow? What can I answerâsave that we did fight, And he is slain? There is no other answer. But can I say this to my father?âno! It is impossible!âor to his mother! It is impossible!âOh 'twould increase Their agoniesâdragg'd with a dripping harrow Through and beyond the natural gates of deathâ To know his brother slew him! I am resolv'd! They shall not know it: I myself will bear All the sharp torment, weighing down life's balance With inward-molten lead; and let my soul, That in calm virtue's ether should be pois'd, Sink all alone to premature dark hellâ But show no shadow of't in words or looks. [Exit Garcia. SCENE II. A thicket in the Forest.âCornelio, Dalmasso, and other Gentlemen, seated beneath a tree, regaling themselves. Cor. There is no luxury equal to it! When you are very tired and exceeding hungry, to rest those limbs that have so faithfully borne your stomach about all day, while the aforesaid stomach, as in duty bound, taketh turn of exercise and servitude for the benefit of his indefatigable members, there's no epicurean feast that gives such pleasure, and no act of gratitude a greater satisfaction! Dal. A more lasting one is possible;âbut come! you hold fast the neck of the wine-flaggon while you talk, and keep the venison under your fork. Push them this way! Cor. I protest I was not conscious thereof! Dal. Like enough; but everybody else was. 1st Gent. There's nothing equal to forest-cookery! Cor. Besides, you can replenish your dish from the next thicket. Which now, gentlemen, do ye think the best; the game that runs, or the game that flies? Dal. That flies away, do you mean? Cor. No, no; but which? 2nd Gent. Why, if you were very sharp set, that game is best which you can first catch. Cor. Dalmasso, I'll meet thy question. I think that game best which flies away: it leaves so much to the imagination. All. Ha! ha! ha!âit doesâit does! Cor. Dalmassoâhere's more venison. Dal. Not a morselâI hate the sight of it! All. Oh! oh! Dal. I'm an exhausted receiver. Cor. I think you must be, by this time. Dal. 'Tis well I have escaped all vile conceits in the shape of a retort; but hand me yon flask insteadâI wish to try an experiment with its neck. 1st Gent. He's getting pleasant with his chemistry! Dal. A tri-unal content now fills my carbonic trunk: an oxy-hydrogenico-azotic perfection! Cor. What jargon of science is this? Dal. Jargon to you, I make no doubt: ahem! Cor. What do you mean, sir?âexplain your âhem!â 1st Gent. Explain, sir! 2nd Gent. Enlighten us! Cor. Expose your darkness! No response? He blossoms inward, like the fig: its best beauty, both of colour and taste, is the inside of the bottle. Dal. Go to! what know you of taste or colour? Cor. Thus much by negation: your wit hath no more colour than the nails and knee-caps of a drowned man; a child's tongue that's cutting its teeth; or a drawing in white chalk on a ghost's forehead. If once in the year it entertain a touch of colouring, 'tis green as a colt's nether lip when the day-break fields are reeking. As to thy tasteâanother wedge o' the pasty; thank youâ 1st Gent. Mass! how you do eat! Cor. As to your taste, 'tis my belief, were a dozen Pharaoh-mummies chemically expressed in a stick of Spanish liquorice, the very conceit of it would make you glory in the suction! Dal. Oh, antithetical sublimation of humanity! Do I sit here to be insulted by the pictures of thine own squinting fantasy? Cor. No; you sit here to eat and drink, like the rest of us. Dal. Do I, sir? Cor. Yes; and apparently by some great law. Dal. Ahem!âthe day wears. (Rising suddenly.) Where can the Princes be? All rise hastily. Cor. I'faith, they must be lost! Dal. What's best to do? Cor. You said that if with patience here we sat They soon would find us! Dal. Did I say so? 'Twas youâ Surely 'twas you, sir,âyou that first propos'd Refreshment 'neath the tree! I'd fain have search'd The forest thro', to find them! Cor. Pshaw! not you. Dal. Not I, sir? come, explain yourself! [Lays his hand upon his sword. These gentlemen know well that you do wrong me! Cor. What I have said, sirâ Enter Garcia. All. Here's Prince Garcia! [A pause of silence ensues. Dal. We do rejoice to see you here, my lord: We search'd till quite exhausted. Cor. Quite worn out! Where is my lord Giovanniâclose at hand? Gar. (calmly). Is he not here? All. No!âno! Dal. Where did you leave him? Cor. Where, my lord? Gar. I know not. Think ye this forest, gentlemen, like a city, That I can name its windings and dark walls, Its gaps, high mounds, and green enclosures? Surely Ye do but jestâhe's hidden to alarm me? Dal. Where?âwhat is this! Cor. Indeed he is not here! Gar. Come, stand asideâ (He passes through, looking behind the group, as if in search.) Well, if he be not with ye, Take blame unto yourselves, so ill to 'tend him! Ye knew him unaccustom'd to this place: He hath seldom hunted here. Dal. What must we do? Cor. We lost you both together: Where did you see him last? Gar. In the forest I left him somewhereâthere it was we parted. (Aside.) I can endure no longer. (Abruptly.) Fools that we are! He hath return'd!âfatigued, and having lost us, He is, ere this, in Florence! All. Right!âno doubt! Cor. I see 'tis so; and on his downy bed, Half dress'd, yet needing rest before the dance, Is sleeping soundly? Gar. (aside). Oh! on the cold, hard earth He sleepsâtoo soundly! Cor. Let us straight return! All. Agreedâaway! let's haste! [Exeunt, all but Dalmasso and a Huntsman. Dal. Stay you with me! Ere night-fall we must search the forest depths In the same track the ardent princes sped When last we saw them; for I much do fear Some accident:âI know not what to think! [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Portico in Florence. Enter a Professor and two Students. Prof. I shall inform you of their several names, And wherefore each is famous, as they pass. Since ye're but late from Pisa, 'tis not likely Your eyes should recognize them; tho' their works May be companion'd by your memories. 1st Stu. We greatly thank you, sir! 2nd Stu. The festival Will be adorn'd with heterogenous talents: Will't not, Professor? Prof. Truly so: you will find Courtiers and cavaliers, and lovely dames, Artists, astronomers, mechanists, and scholars, Critics, historians, chemists, and a shoal Of poets and musicians. 1st Stu. Shoals of poets! Nay, after that the devil himself may come; For 'twill be hot enough. Prof. I should have said, Writers of songs and anniversary odes, Sweet rhymes and levities to please the fair; With real poets sprinkled 'midst the group. 1st Stu. Shoals of musicians! Oh, what quiring glee! Mountains of meat, and cataracts of wine! 2nd Stu. Who are all these? Prof. A few are of some note. A Group, in rich attire, pass across the back of the Stage. Prof. Those are Noblemen of the Court, and Cavaliers of the Order of St Etienne. He, with the close black beard, large hands, and something of lameness in his gait, is Count Zelatore, who was originally a private soldier, but received his title and estates for his great valour and judgment in the Siennese wars. The bending figure near him, with the large grey beard, is Medicino, the famous old General. The three who walk abreast, a little apart from the rest, are the Cardinals of Florence. A second Group pass across. 1st Stu. Who is that tall, bird-like personage strutting in front, with the rich jewel in his huge bonnet and the smallest possible face under it,âthe dark, slashed doublet, and crimson mantle as bright as an auto da fÃ©? Prof. I do not know: methinks he ought to walk last. That thin figure in the centre is Vasari, the painter. His writings are of value, and have just been published at the Duke's express direction. May Vasari prove grateful! Beside him is his friend, the accomplished Pietro Aretino, whom some few love, and many hate. Near him, on the right, are Pontormo, Naldini, Bronzino, and Schidone, all engaged on different works for the Duke. 1st. Stu. See, again, an extraordinary object, with ruffles and rapierâwhat a rapier!âand no calves to his legs! Is't the Ambassador from France? Prof. 'Tis probable. I thought at first it was his valet. Mark you that tall personage, of firm and graceful carriage!âit is Guicciardini, the historian, who proposed his Highness as Duke of Florence, when the Council of Forty-eight were assembled. That figure striding alone in fierce embroidery, with a certain air of energy and defiance, is Benvenuto Cellini. 1st Stu. Ay, sir; we have seen the rare Cellini before. 2nd Stu. You might know his walk a mile off. 'Tis exactly that of a gladiator who hath just killed his man. Enter a Musician. 1st Stu. Learned sir! what fat, silver-headed, satin-coated gentleman is this, who carries so much luggage in front beneath his melon-blossom vest? Prof. It is Policarpo Guazzetto, the celebrated musicianâotherwise called Trattenuto del Vento, since he hath been in years. Mus. (running forward). Ah! my lord Professor, is it you?âyour servant, Master Hautboy and Master Triangle! (To Professor) Clever fellows, eh? Has't seen Benvenuto Cellini pass by this way? Prof. He hath this moment passed. Mus. Ha!âthen shall I overtake him briskly. All this morning have I been with him, and left his house but that I might dress, perfume, and render myself more angelic than ordinary. He hath been singing me an ode of his own composure for this brilliant occasion, wherein he himself seemeth to be the Duke, and the Duke his much-admiring friend. Still, very goodâI mean the music is goodâof poetry I am no judge; but his music is goodâthat is, for an amateur. Every man should keep to his own profession. Bronzino also sings well, and hath a good voiceâfor an unformed voice. But every man should keep to his own profession. I sat up with him half last night. He knows no more about music than a rhinoceros. Prof. Was there nothing upon his easel which you could admire? Mus. I' faith, there was! He had the head of an old Cardinal, half done;âseemed quite a daub, and to ha' cost him no manner of pains,âbut at a little distance there was the complete face of the man! Can't conceive, for the life o' me, how it's done! Prof. Doubtless, a copy from Michael Angelo? Mus. Don't know in the least. 'Twas a stern, dark-bearded, grand-looking old fellow. I could tell exactly in what a fine sonorous voice he would sing the bass to a mass. But I need waste no more time in speaking of Cardinals, for there will be a feast to-night that shall henceforth make repletion one of the Cardinal Virtues! [Exit Musician. 1st Stu. Who is that, sir?âhe who so gloomily paces along by a different route from the rest, with his eyes now fixed on the ground,âand now glancing askaunce, with a ferocious expression round the mouth? 2nd Stu. Murder and rapine are at work in both. Prof. (in an under tone). Envy impelling him from behind, and oblivion standing before him, contend for his soul. It is Baccio Bandinelli. 1st Stu. But lo! yon distant patriarch, robed and swathed In massive folds, with beard of hewn-iron grey, Who heavily moves!âhis sombre body bowed By labour and old time! 2nd Stu. Slow falls his pace, Measuring the earth, as for a giant's grave! Prof. 'Tis Michael Angelo! 2nd Stu. Thou mighty soul! Heaven's temples claim the adornment of thine hand; And space, new worlds! A third Group pass across. Prof. Those gentlemen who are in advance of the rest, are Giovanni Baptista, Cini, Baldini, Filipo Nerli; all historians. He who follows, attired in such splendour, is the poet Della Casa, Archbishop of Benevento; and on his right walk Landi and Primerani, the dramatists, followed close by Lasca, the novelist, and Pietro Vettori, the critic and scholar. A little to the left of Della Casa, engaged in earnest conversation with the sculptors Ammanati and John of Bologna, is the high-minded Benedetto Varchi, the learned historian and patriotic supporter of the republican Strozzi, who, though previously opposed to the Duke, hath recently been made his private librarian, in place of Chiostro; albeit the republican sentiments of Varchi remain unchanged. Enter Macchietti and a Gentleman, disputing. Mac. I do assure you, sir, you are most thoroughly misled about the matter! He is a genuine sculptor, sir; an inspired sculptorâquite equal to Cellini, and beyond Bandinelliâand Del Passato's judgment goes with mine: Passato admires his excellence. Gent. I cannot discover it. Mac. Very likely. Gent. His figures have no more design in them than an English chimney-pot. Mac. He is not happy in his figures; his excellence âjudge of a man by his excellenceâis in his heads. Look at his bust of the Prince Giovanni! It is exquisite! The execution is masterly: not too highly polished, but fleshy; the expression mild, sensitive, thoughtful, rife with subtle passion, and to the life! Gent. I have not seen it. Mac. And if you had, sir? Enter Chiostro, with Berta and Christina, richly attired. Chris. Dispute no more! there shall be nought but smiles to-day. Prof. 'Twas a high argument. Chi. Macchietti had reason therein. Ber. Dispute no more! Take us away among ye, most grave and circuitous scholars! Mac. Wellâbut I know I am right in this. Chris. 'Tis the first time, then, sweet husband! Thou should'st have an obelisk of wax set up i' the spot. Ber. With a wick in it, sir; that we might see to read your exploit! Mac. Comeâcome! [Exeunt; manent two Students. 1st Stu. Dispute no more! Paint a smile i' the palm of your hand, and box the ears of the world till the amiable impression become universal. 2nd Stu. Set up a candle to light your folly, while your fame melts away! 1st Stu. Analysis and synthesis, ye are nothing to a tongue! Its point is as fine as the tooth of a mite, that hath thirty positive bellies to one possible brain. 2nd Stu. The cow that harangued Livy in choice Latin, could not have more completely silenced philosophy and art. 1st Stu. Dispute no more! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Grand Hall of the Ducal Palace. Cosmo seated in the Ducal Chair; the Duchess near him. Nobles, Cavaliers, Ladies, Gentlemen, &amp;c. &amp;c., ranged on each side. Triumphal music. Cosmo. Nobles, and cavaliers, and gentlemen! Equally noble in your several virtues, Accept Duke Cosmo's thanks for all your love, In the address, spontaneous and full-hearted, Thus tender'd to ourselves; whereof a part So large doth of far better right belong To the high memories that crown this day! Bear, then, in mind the glorious names of those Who fell, when Marciano's victory Laid broad foundation for our towering sway. [Triumphal music. 'Tis our regret, at such a ripen'd season, The Princes should not with their presence grace This Anniversary, which, though so brief In't's outward show, is one of Time's best harvests. I doubt not hither they are spurring apace; And ere the sweeping shade of man and steed Be lost in widening night-fall, they'll appear, And add their greeting to our own best welcome. CHORUS. 'Twas ancient Saturn's children fell By his stern hand and fate's decree, Lest they, unnatural, should rebel, And desolate heaven's majesty. But that primÃ¦val king, Deceiv'd, and dim-eyed, crush'd a stone That form'd the basis of his throneâ And lost stars o'er him swing! Long hid in Latium's forests old, With him came forth the Age of Gold; Kind deeds, and lovely arts, and creeds Whose altars bore not aught that bleeds, But, images of clay: Thus did the father of great Jove The earth with gifts divine improve, Which gild the present day. [The Duke descends from the Chair of State. Cosmo. Now to the banquet-hall! My noble friends! Thus rich in Florence' beauty, little need Have we of garish torches, dead at the core; With such soft brightness burning from within, And radiant to the footâWho's this? with's spear, And grey with dust! Enter Dalmasso, hastily. See you aright, sir? Dal. Duke! Your Highness' private earâ Cosmo. Come, sir; be brief. [They step aside. Dal. The Prince Giovanniâ Cosmo. Wherefore stays he thus? Giovanni and young Garcia should be here: I'm anger'd at their stayâha! what has happen'd, That thus aghast you look? Dal. Giovanni's dead! Cosmo. Who?âdead?âwho's dead? Dal. GiovanniâPrince Giovanni! We've found his body in the forest. Cosmo. And dead?âutterly?âthe last spark gone? Dal. Quite cold! Cosmo. Stand fast!âremain you here. Duch. (advancing). We wait Your Highness' pleasure. Cosmo. I shall join you anon. Some strange intelligence from distant lands Immediate audience claims. Duchess, lead on! [Exeunt, all but Cosmo and Dalmasso. Cosmo. Repeat thine horrid news: or if't may be, Correct and qualifyâsay he is dying, But by a timely aid may yet be saved! Tell me thou art not in thy proper mind, But do not tell me that my son is dead! Dal. Would I were mad, or wild with wine, or dreaming!â But 'tis too true! Cosmo. How should he die!âwhat dastards Stood by to see the forest boar's fierce tusks Root out his life? Dal. 'Twas no fierce boar that did it, Nor wolfâ Cosmo. Aha! death's face grows darker! what, then, did it? Dal. We know not: in the forest's depths we found him. His wild steed, bounding past us, help'd the search. His blood had still some warmthâbut he was dead. Cosmo. Art sure? Dal. Most sure: one huntsman only with me, We could not thence remove him. Cosmo. Lies he there E'en now? Dal. He does: the huntsman seated close, With face as white. Near him this broken point, As of a sword-bladeâ Cosmo. Whose is't? Dal. I know not; But by his side we found his own. Cosmo. Unsheath'd? Dal. Unsheath'd and stain'd, as tho' he had fought. Cosmo. No, no! He hath been foully murder'd, and 'twas drawn To cheat stern retributionâwho has done it? Where's Garciaâwhere was Garcia when 'twas done? Dal. The Princes parted from us when the chase Was at a headlong height; when he rejoin'd us He came alone, nor knew he aught of itâ As it did seem. Cosmo. Oh! I will find the truth, Were't from the very stones! My passionate grief Shall breed an inspiration and a power Oracularâexecutive! (After a pause) Now, mark me fixedly: When that the banquet doth confuse all thoughts With dazzling vanities and high-wrought blood, Hie thou away into the forest gloom, With fit attendants, whom thou well can'st trust. There, from grey dawn to dusk thy vigil keep: Then, secretly return. As secretly Bring thou my son's dead body with all care, And forthwith place it in the anteroom Of mine own private chamber! Go at once; But let no syllable of these commands By thee be breath'd, or those who shall attend thee; Nor aught relating to this dark event. Dal. Your Highness' orders shallâ Cosmo. Dost understand? Dal. I do, my liege. Cosmo. Go then, at once, I pray you. Exit Dalmasso. What's all this coil of stateâambitious hopes, Wars, well-won honours, policies, designs, Ponderings and weighings, aching sleepless nights, Or acts decisive, breeding years of toil To work out good results!âthus in a moment Comes simple death, and all's at once dispers'd Like straws before a sudden-open'd gate! But what's ambition's wreck to this my loss? And lamentation startles into horror At something that's behind! I will know all, Tho' half should crush me! Slaughter'd son! thy blood Will rise up in a haze as wide as twilightâ Concentrateâform and lo! the mighty image Shall, like the solemn voice of desert winds, Pronounce thy murderer's name! I would evade The appalling force of thoughtsâbut why evade? Best meet them, for results they e'en must have Which I should meetâand therefore, that I will! Why comes not Garcia, choking with grief and haste? He saw his brother lastâhe last was with him, And must know somewhat of his death, or loss! Why not? I fear to answer to myself! [Exit Cosmo. SCENE V. A Corridor of the Palace. Music within. Enter Garcia. Gar. Oh what a hell of anguish is the sound Of jocund music to despairing souls! 'Tis like malicious revelry of fiends O'er some new comer, who in horror sits Apart, clasping his chains, and looking upward Thro' space and time, to heaven's lost realm of peace! Why should I feel heaven lost? What have I done? Murder'd a brother?ânoâno! Yet, he's slain! Slain by my sword! 'Twas Iâ'twas I that did itâ Unwittinglyâsuch was my fatal chance, Which e'en might have been his: would it had been! CHORUS , within. Fill! fill the bossy Vulcan bowl, Whose images of Saturn's reign Start as they feel the Bacchic soul Ecstatic thro' the metal's vein! Fill, to the fresh Saturnian sway, While the dead smile amidst their clay! Gar. Those sounds do seem commission'd to inflict Racks on my heart and madness on my brain! While merrimentâthe feast, song, danceâtranspires, My brother dead, lies in the forest cold, At mercy of the wolves! Oh howling Night! I hear thee, and yon hall of mirth doth echo Thine awful voice, taunting my soul's confusion! I'll to the forest!âwhen?âto-morrow's eve: And these my fratricidal hands shall dig His grave; these eyes, that saw him die, shall pour Tears for his parents o'er himâand if prayers From me can struggle into utterance, Then prayersâwho's this?âit is Ippolita! I cannot meet her!âwhy, why was I born! [Exit. Enter Ippolita. Ippo. Giovanni shuns the banquet: 'tis his grief At the sad words wherewith we parted last! Or is't that he would wean his heart from me, And sickens with the effort?âyet 'tis fix'd That I must ne'er be his. But is it right To sacrifice my loveâhis happinessâ To gratitude; the greater to the less, In feeling's scale? Let me not think of this! Enter Cosmo. Cosmo. Still Garcia comes not to explain? He has join'd A group of dancers; but with such a look As makes him seem most fearfully alone. Horror sits in his hair!âas grief in mine. Ippolita!âwhy art thou wandering, girl, With wretched looks? Ippo. I have a weightâhereâhere! I would your Highness knew the cause? Cosmo. I've cares Enough to swell the sea;âyet, tell thy grief. Ippo. I have long desir'd to do so, But could not gather courage first to make The sacrifice that should accompany A sad, brief story. Cosmo. I, perchance, have heard Less hopeful narratives. By Dante's soul! There are more dragons in the world than men; More graves than hearts! Nayâdo not tremble, child! Comeâfreely speak: I've ta'en thy father's place? Ippo. Thou hastâthou hast!âhence greater cause for grief! Cosmo. How so? Ippo. I have abus'd your confidence And love; but I will fix'd atonement make, Far as may be. Cosmo. I understand thee not. Ippo. I love the prince!âwith painful pride, not shame, I do confess myself as much belov'd. Cosmo. The Prince! Ippo. Forgive the offenceâthe prince Giovanni. Cosmo (aside). Oh! what is here? Ippo. I know not how, my liege, I stole into his bosom. Cosmo. Girlâno more! Ippo. (aside). I fear'dâI had no hopeâ Uphold me, fortitude! My lord, one wordâ Cosmo. Forbear, Ippolita!âor to the Duchess Communicate the rest. [Going. Ippo. Oh 'tis soon told. When that I heard your Excellency design'd Giovanni's hand for an Imperial bride, I did relinquish my presumptuous claim; Nor would I wish my poor deserts should mar The brilliant fortunes of the man I love. With all respect and filial reverence, Giovanni will submit him to your wish. Cosmo. My childâno more! (aside) This deepens all the wounds! Ippo. Let me unload my breastâlet me unload it! I have resolv'd I never will be his; I have surrender'd all save inward feelings, For which retention I do crave your pardon, The more, my liege, since I confess them suchâ So deep and potentâthat were't not thus base Ungratefully to outrage your adoption, I would not lose him were he thrice a Prince, And all earth's Potentates our love oppos'd! But as it isâhere ends my history! Cosmo. Love's heroism is equal to all acts, But seldom to forbearance. Noble girl! Thou art well worthyâis there no comfort left? Thy father in the wars preserved my life; Had I not ta'en his place, ingratitude In me had been most baseâit was no fault That thou did'st love my son. Ippo. I will withdraw, Lest he returnâI must not see him now. [Exit, despairingly. Cosmo. But I must see him soon as he returns, Outstretch'd beyond fair nature's symmetry, And rigid in his blood!âhis awful face Scarce cognizable, e'en to meâOh, Garcia! Can this fell deed be thine?âif 'tis, then tremble! END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A Street.âEnter Garcia and Luigi del Passato. Pass. Then, there's the tomb of the Assyrian King, Where couchant sphynxes stare on vacancy 'Neath the broad shadows of white mulberry trees That, in a double range, converge in front. It is a level mass of solid stoneâ Traced o'er with hieroglyphics and strange formsâ Whereon the fabric of an ancient god, Grown blind with gazing on eternity, Sits in the gap of unprogressive time, And seems an Exile from remoter worlds! Gar. These are too far remov'd for sympathiesâ Such as I fain would feel. Pass. Say not, too far: He who died yesterday is full as old, In his new state, as Cheops and King Nine. Gar. (aside). Oh brother! art thou, then, so grey in death Already! Pass. 'Tis a lovely monument Where Livy sleeps in Padua. I have oft Sat for whole days beside it, and have smiled To see the figures slowly change their goldâ Grow bronzyâwhiteâand then, o'ermass'd with shade. Gar. Why should'st thou smile because it held a stranger, For whom, if thou had'st known him, tears had flow'd? Pass. Mine eyes are wet for no man: but when years Are pass'd, and mourners have forgotten love, The tears o' the mind congeal, and with slow hand, That's sensitive with memory in each touch, I shape them to a marble bust, and place it In some sequester'd place where no one comesâ Unless to pray. Gar. Oh! that in such a place I had the bust of one who is no more, That I might ease my soul to it, in prayer! Pass. (aside). Some heavy loss is figur'd in his heart; I do but grieve him by this conversation Which he did seek so earnestly: I'll leave him. [Exit Passato. Gar. Gone!âhe can rove, and with a steady mind, No matter where: but Iâwhere can I go? Existence is become a sleepless fiend Within, and on the surface of my flesh. Despite the efforts of my will, I feel My face is written over with the worst, Although a lie to reason. Rise, my soul! There's work to do i' the forest. I must go. To-night, Giovanni, while the trembling stars, With the cold visage of the awful moon, Gaze down upon me, lighting up that cheek On which I dare not lookâthou shalt be buried! [Retires. Enter Zacheo. Zach. 'Twas meet that I, being chief o' the band, should make some daring effort, as a last chance to save us from immediate destruction; and, unless I be much deceived, my courage and cunning are well trimmed in a fair wind. From the close observation I have since taken of the dead body in the forest, while he who watched it was asleep, I do assuredly believe 'tis one of the Duke's sons; for they were hunting there, and I hear that the youngest only is returned. Methinks I descry a plan whereby I can turn this death to bright advantage. What pale boy-noble is that? By our Prophet! the very youth who fought with the Prince in the forest! How much trouble doth good fortune save us. (Garcia advances.) So, my lord! you are come back? Gar. What says the friar? Zach. I say, you are come back? Gar. Come back? Zach. Yes; from the forest. Gar. Forest! Zach. Where you went hunting with the Duke's son. Come, Do not attempt to fool with me, young man! Gar. With thee, rude-throated monk, dost thou not know me? Zach. Not Iâ How should I?âwho are you, forsooth? Gar. Don Garcia, second Prince of Florence. Zach. (aside). Wheu! What shall I make of this?â'tis a new land, Where harvests grow in horror. Allah be praised! Gar. And what art thou, for sure thou art no friar? Zach. Not I; I hate the race! Gar. What art thou, then? Zach. I do not greatly care if I do trust you, Knowing you'll not betray me. I am Zacheo, Chief of the Turkish Pirates. Gar. Art thou mad, If thou be'st he, thus to proclaim thyself To one who should arrest thee for thy head? Zach. My head is safeâay, safer in the city Than some heads are in forests. Gar. Fly! escape! Fly while thou may'st! Zach. And why dost thou not fly? Gar. Who! who? Zach. Come, comeâthou know'st well what I mean? Gar. What mean'st thou! Zach. I did see you in the forest Murder your brother! Gar. Liar! monster! liar! [Rushes upon Zacheo, who shakes him off. Zach. Off, younker!âoff,âwhy, I did see you do it. Gar. Saw me! saw what?âah! then thou saw'st it all? Thou saw'st his provocationâhis attackâ Thou saw'st us fighting fairly, hand to hand? Zach. (aside). I'll not be caught! He'd have me for a witness. No, no. Gar. You saw it all? Zach. I saw you kill him: I saw that! Gar. You first saw him draw upon meâ And then we fought? Zach. Fought! I saw nought of that. One thing I only knowâyou kill'd him! Gar. Oh! Despair is deepen'dâhope's last flash is spent! Zach. (aside) Now must I trap him: none shall know the secretâ Thus can I hold it like a storm-cloud o'er him. I will take means to have him seiz'd, and borne Straight to the coastâas hostage will I keep him, And with the Duke make termsâand with him too, When he is Duke! Gar. Will gold assist me, Pirate, To rivet silence? Zach. Ay, a little gold. 'Twill solder down the lid upon this secret: But to make sure, we'd better bury him? Gar. Bury him!âbury himâto be sureâthat's right! We'll do't at onceâimmediateâ'tis exactly What I have thought of ever sinceâall dayâ All day and nightâthis night we'll bury him! Zach. (aside) He springs into my net. (Aloud) We willâwe will. Gar. Thou art a most discreet and proper person For such an officeâI discern it plainlyâ Such things I am not used toâthou'rt the man: Goâgo aloneâand bury him to-night! Zach. Alone!âno, noâI cannot do it alone: You must go with me? Gar. Goldâtake gold instead? Zach. And buy a helpmate, who may recognize Whom 'tis we bury, and betrayâ Gar. I'll go: I must go with thee. Zach. Some one comes this wayâ A dolphin of the court, wavering in gold. Gar. Where shall we meet? Zach. The outskirts of the forest. [Exit Garcia, hastily. Enter Cornelio. Cor. Prince Garcia with a friar! He rush'd in haste awayâ'twas not confession: Such converse and such flight are all unlike His nature! The absence of the Prince Giovanni Confounds usâand dark rumours plague the airâ But where's Dalmasso? Zach. (aside). Seven of my band Are in the cityâtwo will be enough. [Going. Cor. A word, good friar! Zach. Rich blessings on my lord! Cor. Hast had long conference with Prince Garcia? Zach. Garcia?âwho's he?âI am a stranger here. Cor. Was't not Don Garcia? Zach. No! by my soul 'twas not! Cor. Nay, 'an thou dost not know him, how can'st swear? Zach. Swear! did I swear? I pray the heav'ns forgive meâ And for all future oaths. [Exit Zacheo, abruptly. Cor. Wonderful prayer! 'Tis a professional licence to forestal All truth and temper; but in external showâ Having more black than white in his eyes, and scorning The bent back, humbleness, and funeral tone,â Well might one deem him fit for worldly action, And cut-purse sleights, rather than shriving souls! [Exit. SCENE II. Public Gardens.âEnter Berta and Christina. Chris. Was't not a festival of all rare beauty and brilliance, notwithstanding the Duke's ill temper? Would it were all to come again with the morrow? Bert. What could have made the Duke so gloomy and sad? Chris. Bad news from some foreign court, it is said: from the Emperor of Germany perhaps. Bert. I did not think the Duke ill-tempered: he is never ill-tempered, though sometimes he seems very stern and severe. But on that night, Christina, I saw him several times turn his head aside, with such a look, just as though he would burst into tears,âay, become all tears; and even at the height of the merriment the recollection of it once or twice quite made my heart ache. Chris. And did the Duke shed tears, Berta? Bert. No, I didn't see one: for just when I thought they where coming in a flood, he shut his eyes very, very close, and when he opened them again the tears seemed all to have gone inward. Chris. I noticed him once or twice looking over the hall where we all were, as if it were a shocking dream; but I ran away whenever I saw him coming, and forgot it as soon as I could. [They retire. Enter Zacheo and two Pirates, disguised also as friars. Zach. As to the dead body that lies in the forest, we will take care not to meddle with it: I have good cause for thinking our doing so might be dangerous; and burying it can be of no use to our future designs, as some folks about the court have already seen it. Two of the hunting party went back, and very soon found it; albeit, for some private motives, I suppose, it remains there, hard and fast. What we have to do is merely to seize the young man who comes to meet us; gag him, and carry him off to the coast. 1st Pi. We understand. 2nd Pi. If he resists, I suppose we are not to give him the point, but only notch him here and there, not very deep, with the edge? 1st Pi. Or just break one leg, a littleâpoor boy! Zach. Neither, neither! he must not be injured. I want to use him. 1st and 2nd Pi. O!âoho! Berta and Christina, advancing. Chris. Our lover with the coal-black eyes and beard, 'tis certain! But the other two? Bert. Doubtless his conversation with them differs vastly from the strain wherein the naughty hypocrite chaunted that strange song to us. Could we but over-hear them! Chris. They perceive us! Zach. A whirlwind catch these women! 1st Pi. Why? 2nd Pi. I approve the build of them much. Zach. Well, well. (Aloud.) Our blessings on the gentlewomen! 1st Pi. Yes, our very best blessâ Zach. Be silent! Chris. (to Bert.) They are grim, rough men; but do not seem of an ill nature. Zach. Lovely and devout daughters of Florence! I must now bid you farewell, as we have some sacred business to settle. Let me salute your hands, whiter i' the pearly palm, I swear by our Prophet's beard, than the inside of any oyster-shell! [Offers to kiss Berta's hand. Bert. You must not do so! 1st Pi. (to Chris.) Daughter, your hand! By that same oyster'sâI mean Mahomet'sâpearly beardâ Chris. (Snatching her hand away). I like not such languageâshame on thy shaven crown! Enter Macchietti and Chiostro, from behind. Mac. My wife! she hath just given her fingers to be pinched and fondled by that ill-favoured friar! Chios. Mine also, if my eyes see aright! Bert. Christina! our husbands! Chris. And seeing us, plainly! Zach. Your husbands!âwe'll go. Bert. You must notâyou must not! they have observed your most unfatherly salutations. Chris. We shall introduce you! Nay, 'an you stir, we are all dishonoured. Bert. We must at once devise somewhat that shall give them a respect for you! I shall say you are a very learned friar indeed! Zach. Me! no, no! sweet lady, I beseech you! Chris. (to 1st Pi.) And I shall say you are the celebrated friar who paints altar-pieces! 1st Pi. With all my heart. 2nd Pi. And Iâwhat shall I be? Bert. Dumb! Chiostro and Macchietti, coming forward. Macc. I fear we interrupt some pious homily? 2nd Pi. (to 1st.) What's homily? 1st Pi. (aside). 'Tis a paste of pigeons' eggs. Bert. Interrupt!âwe were but now most anxious for your presence. This is a very learned friar, just arrived in Florence, from All-saints' Monastery, in the north of SpainâGod bless us! Chios. Oh, indeed!âFather, you are welcome among us. Zach. Many thanks, worthy sir. Chris. This is the celebrated Friar Innocent, who is so famous in Spain for painting altar-pieces! Macc. Eh?âah!âI shall rejoice in his acquaintance! 1st Pi. A shoal of thanks, worthy sir. Macc. (aside). I never heard his name before, as a painter! 2nd Pi. (aside to 1st). The Innocent of All-saints, ha! ha! ha! Chios. (to Zach.) Doubtbless, the learned father is familiar with all the Hebrew authorities, touching the early history of the Jewish nation? I am at this time endeavouring to discover what is become of those of the ten tribes of Israel whom we have not yet been able to trace? Zach. I wish you every success, I'm sure. I dare say, worthy dervish, you will find them, if you keep a sharp look out. Chios. (aside). Dervish!ârather abrupt in speechâ but I make no doubt, a very profound scholar. Macc. (to 1st Pi.) Had I made a journey to the north of Spain, we should speedily have become acquainted; but I have never been there. 1st Pi. That's a pity. Macc. Nor have I ever seen any of your famous altar-pieces. 1st Pi. How should you, unless they had been stolen, or the walls they're nailed on could walk? Macc. Ahem! Bert. (to Chris.) Did'st expect this? Chios. (to Zach.) I have noticed that the figures on the old Egyptian sarcophagiâmany of which figures are evidently water-menâ Zach. Yes, I understand all about that. Chios. No doubtâI beg your pardon! I have noticed, I was about to say, a great resemblance between these figuresâin shape, colour, and even in symbolic accompanimentsâand those of the ancient Mexicans. 'Tis true, indeed, that there is somewhat universally primitive in their entire appearance. You observe they are probably traced from the wall-shadows of men, and are altogether very like the first scrawled effigy of humanity that childhood loveth to depict. Nevertheless, I concludeâbut may I enquire what opinion the learned father entertaineth? Zach. My opinion is the same as yours; but 'tis not worth a cockle-shell. We're here, and we're there, and then we're with God. And where that may be, is no business of yours. Chios. (aside). A coarse and crabbed man!âthe result of ascetic studies in monastic walls. (To Zacheo) You have gone to the bottom, I see. Zach. If I had, how should I be here?âbut the watermen you spoke of, they are all gone long ago to the bottom of the sea. Chios. (aside). Doth he purpose to insult me!âor is this some erudite petrifaction of laboured and remote wit? Bert. (to Chris.) I would, Christina, all this were at an end! Macc. (to 1st Pi.) What sort of ground dost love to use for painting? 1st Pi. Any ground that first offers. But I work wonders on a good rich groundâthe fat o' the land suits me best. Macc. Prefer you, on all occasions, to lay the colour on fat? 1st Pi. Yes, very: an inch thickâand of mutton. Many's the sheep I ha' used! Macc. Hem! you jest. I should have thought you would prefer distemperâthe grand fresco style. 1st Pi. I like the grand frisking style, tooâbut good health is a blessingâthat! for your distemper! Macc. (aside). A most singular brute! No painter, worthy of the calling, ever had such an eye in his head as this friar; or such a bark-carved and grotesque expression! Paint an altar-piece! (To Christina). And who is this third friar behind, here? Chris. He is a famous painter, also! [Second Pirate comes forward. Macc. (aside). Impossible! Zach. (aside). Why should a man who can wield a sword full as easily as these people use a brush or a pen, stand still to be thus fooled? (To Macchietti). Our brother here, is dumbâquite dumbâ'tis waste of wind to ask him any questions. Macc. Dumb!âhow dos't make him understand, then? Zach. By signsâhe hath a great gift in signs. 1st Pi. Yes; there's none can equal his painting in that line, for signals and ships' heads! Macc. What! (To 2nd Pirate.) And you paint altar-pieces also, I suppose? [Second Pirate nods and gesticulates. Berta and Chris. Ha! ha! ha! Chios. Fie! do not mock his infirmity! Macc. Youâa painter! [Second Pirate throws himself into extravagant attitudes. (To Zach.) Interpret what he means? Zach. He means thatâthatâ 1st Pi. That he can paint fishermen in a storm, with the wind howlingâthe moon sea-sickâthe sails rent all to shiversâthe mast going over the sideâthe boat capsizing, and the fish trodden under foot: and moreover, that he'll paint with theeâthou cold pitch-pot!âfor a hundred crowns, any day and hour thou'lt dare to name! [General astonishment and confusion.] Zach. (to Pirates). We'll go. 1st Pi. (aside). I ha' settled him! Zach. A fool's hell burn thy tongue! 'tis enough to settle us all! We shall now be suspectedâarrestedâ and pay our heads for your wager! 1st Pi. Wilt stay for this? Zach. (aloud). Our blessings on you all! Both Pirates. Good day! [Exeunt Zacheo and Pirates abruptly. Macc. And the dumb one, also! Chios. Yes; the dumb painter hath exhumed a voice. [Exeunt Berta and Christina. Macc. We now turn, for explanation, to youâstay!â they are on the wing! This must be understood completely. [Exit Macchietti hastily after them. Chios. The understanding is of no avail Where grounds of argument are shifting sands! [Exit, at the opposite side. SCENE III. Another part of the Gardens. Enter Cornelio and an Officer. Cor. Sir! let me tell you I've a memory That holds, sir, like the talons of a hawk! Off. You've not the credit for't. Cor. I know that, well; But 'tis most certain, some things I retain. Off. Ay, sir; but then a corsair's face doth change Each year, with fresh-got scars and strange disguises, Cheeks beat to boot-leather, or a nose laid low. Cor. But certain eyes do last a man his life, Never to change, or be forgotten. Mark now! When I was station'dâ'tis five years agoâ Within San Stephano's Fortress, on the coast, One night our men surpris'd a felon rout Of pirates, lurking in a hollow rock. Thro' us they desperately hew'd their way, And by our torches' light their leader's face I saw. Most strange is the resemblance Unto that friar whom I found this morn With Garcia, deep in talk; tho', till this moment, I could not dig the thought up, where I'd seen him! Diavolo scatenato!âthere's the man! And with him two broad-shoulder'd, shambling friars, All hurrying swiftly towards the garden gates! Off. Let's after them! Cor. Have at your cowls, ye rogues! Man follows close when Satan leads the way! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Interior of the Chapel of San Lorenzo.âGarcia, seated at the foot of a Statue. Gar. Ye creeping winds that whisper thro' the aisle, Still in mine ear breathe his continual name With sense of peace; but oh, forbear the sounds That midst pale sepulchres and statues groan, As though the dying, not the dead, were here! [He rises, and slowly advances. He is no slave of circumstance, whose will Is constant to his heart; yet must we oft Act as if slavesâhowever free withinâ Resolv'd on future franchise. Thus, am I, A Prince of Florence, with a Pirate link'd For burial of the dead; and on his mercy, His interest, humour, treachery, or faith, Hangs my dread secret. Would I had told it all! Now 'tis too lateâI should not be believ'd. Our known unfriendliness from infancy, Would, with its steady and progressive march, Crush down my oaths in all their high array. How would my father fix his eye on meâ My tender mother turn aside, and fall! They shall not know it; so will blinded grief, And sad perplexity, rove round the gap Which horror else would crowd!âYonder's the Duke! He sees me!âand his stately step hath changed Into most hurriedâhe is calm again! But with a solemn countenance prepares To speak to me. Now, soul! endure this trial, Come what may, after. Enter Cosmo. Cos. Garcia, why art thou here? Gar. Sir, it is solitary, like myself; Therefore I came. Cos. Why art thou solitary? Gar. Because alone. Cos. Thou need'st not be alone: Many there are well worthy of thy friendship, Of thine own age; virtuous, and bright in talent: Parents thou hast, and a most noble brother? Gar. All this, sir, I confess. Cos. Then, why alone? Gar. Your Highness knows that I have oft preferr'd it To courtly scenes? Cos. Ay, in the forest's gloomâ Perchance companion'd by your dogs and hawks; But not in holy walls? Gar. Into the sanctuary To-day I came, regretful of time lost. Cos. Where is Giovanni? Gar. We have been too much sunder'd. Cos. Answer me, Garcia? Gar. By my soul, I know not! Unless i' the forest? Cos. Why swear'st thou by thy soul? Gar. Because 'tis nearest God! Cos. (aside). If he be guilty, it is nearer th'Accurs'd! (Aloud). Tamper not, boy! Left you your brother well, or sick, or hurt, When last you partedâspeak? Gar. I left him well. Cos. He is not yet return'd: dost thou know that? Gar. I do, sir. Cos. What detains him?âha! Gar. Heaven's will! Cos. (aside). Can he have done it? (Aloud). Then, thou know'st nought more? Gar. Nought more: but I would gladly give my life To see him now come back! Cos. Garciaâno matterâ You need not stay here. Gar. Sir, I kiss your hands. [Exit Garcia. Cos. If he be guilty, he hath fool'd my nerves, Which I did think were lock'd in fortitude; And thus the judge's knees sometimes do tremble Before the criminal: such strength has crime When nature finds excuse in potent minds! If he be guilty, what a monstrous thing Hath issued from my loins! But there remains One trial!âif he bear it, being guilty, He is not human!âif he be innocent, It must be manifest; but if his sword Hath slain his brotherâproved beyond all doubtâ Judgment, with execution hand in hand, Shall from its throne inflexibly descend, And strike the serpent back into his clay. [Exit. SCENE V. An Apartment in the Ducal Palace.âEnter Duchess and Ippolita. Duch. I grieve for both: I would it were not so, Or could be remedied. What said the Duke? You told him all? Ippo. Kindly he spake to me, Without one word of chiding, tho' he seem'd Heavily troubled. I did tell him all That was important. Duch. And to your design Of self-immurement in a convent's walls, What said he? Ippo. That I did not mention. My future life I deem so valueless, I would not listen to one passing sigh For my conclusion. Since I am fix'd to do it, I should not seek for sympathy, which longs To be entreated back. Duch. Thou mak'st me weep By thus rejecting tears. Ippo. Madam, your kindness Hath ever been most motherlike, and now Adds the last pang that points my barb'd resolve. Duch. What saith my son to this?âand tell me, love, Sincerelyâdo'st not know where now he is? Ippo. No, Madam, truly; and I deeply feel I ne'er shall see him more. Duch. Yet, answer me: What think'st thou of his absence? Ippo. That he's gone, To spare my grief at parting, and his own. He would not have me see the preparations For his bright visit to the German court. I ne'er shall see him more! Duch. Thou dost affright me! He is not goneâhe hath not ta'en his leave Of me! Perchance he's in the forest lost? His ardour in the chase hath injured him, Or he'd return: may be, he has sprain'd a joint, And now in some kind peasant's hut is laid. He will be here anon. Ippo. Come when he may, Into life's blighted forest I have plunged, Ne'er to retrace my steps. Duch. Lament not thus! Some youthful noble at a future day Will estimate thy virtues and thy beauty? Ippo. Beauty shall burn out, as the sacrifice On passion's altar, ruin'd tho' it be. No: since I cannot wed the man I love Above all others, beyond measurement Or expectation of the fondest hope, I'll wed my soul unto his memory; Thus liveâand for this onlyâand then die! Duch. My child! Ippo. Sweet lady! do not pity me; For pride oft braids the hair that sorrow moistens. The prince hath prov'd his duty; I, my love; And cypress-sceptred Misery follows both! [Exeunt. SCENE VI. The Forest. Night.âEnter Zacheo and two Pirates. Zach. 'Tis a pitch-black night. The vault above, with that one star, looks like a long hole into some terrible place! I fear we ha' lost him! 1st Pi. The moon does not rise these two hours. Zach. Sink the moon! 1st Pi. No, no! poor thing; she's useful. Zach. We ought to have fallen in with the boy ere this, were't dark as the seventh pit. 2nd Pi. I ha' no objection, myself, to a bit o' moon now and then. Zach. Hist! what's that? Something rustled i' the boughs! 1st Pi. 'Twas a wolf; he just shoved his nose out from yon thicket to reconnoitre us with a sniffâbut he's a wise beast. 2nd Pi. We are no prize for man or wolf. Zach. I think for myself. My head hath fifty crowns of gold set upon it; and I am vastly suspicious that we are not the only men groping about this forest to-night. 1st Pi. The young man you hope to see? Zach. And others, whom we fear. I have heard voices i' the wind. 1st Pi. Singing in the hollow bole of a tree, then. Zach. Attend to me! The young man, as I told you, expects me here, to help him bury a friend who has been killed by somebody in the forest. 1st Pi. I dare say he did it himself. Zach. Pshaw! not he, nor I either. We shall find him, ere long. When we hear him approach, you shall stand fast at a little distance, till I have told him the body is buried without his help, and have drawn him off to the right part of the outskirts. You will then come up, in the way of friendship, as benighted travellers, till I give the signal to bind him, and take him to our haunt. 1st Pi. We understand. Zach. This way: hist! be silentâdon't brush the boughs so roughly. 1st Pi. Who can help it? Zach. Hist!âthis wayâstand fast when you hear him coming. [Exeunt. Enter Garcia. Gar. I've stagger'd blindly round the awful spot Where he doth lieâI dared not to approach My brother's body!âthere's an atmosphere Circling the ground, that bars me like a wall Whereon sit spirits of the other world, Silent as death, and doubly terrible! Why came I here alone? I should have known 'Twas useless. Where's the swarthy, hard-featur'd man, Who's pledg'd to aid meâhe who knows it all? All!âno, no, no!âhe doth but know the end, Else might his knowledge save me! Where is he? I've missed him at the entrance. I am here Alone, and in a spot that seems cut off From natureâand my feelings and my thoughts Begin to take the toneâghastly, accurs'd; Yet void of action as an empty hell, Wherein I stand a king, whose only subjects Are rebel torments pent within his soul! I will break through this spell! I'm innocent! Yonder the body of my brother lies: 'Tis fit I give it burial: these my hands Shall with a sacred feeling dig his grave, And place him there, as in his mother's lap. His mother's! Oh! let not my brain whirl thus! It must be doneâor here I'll wait for ever. My soul hath sworn this to itself, and nature Cannot oppose the power that breeds all acts! [He retires up the stage; but rushes back with a cry of horror. They come!âthey come!âthe spirits of the earth, Abhorring murder by a brother's hand, Will not permit him to do sacrilege By opening her breast!âthe ministers Of nature take the office on themselves, In horror of my deed! They come! they come! [The body of Giovanni, covered with a dark hanging mantle, is slowly and silently borne across the back of the stage. One dim torch is carried in front. The slow train, enveloped in their cloaks, follow in darkness. They're gone! What means it? O, thou terrible dream! Whose pageant hath appall'd my waking soul; Whether my brain delirious conjur'd thee, Or that thy scene was realâwhat can be Thy purport to me? I will fly this spotâ I can but dieâand any grave will suit me, So that it be not here! [Rushes away. Enter Zacheo and Pirates. Zach. Hist! hist!â'twas he! Yonder he speeds, with wild, uneven steps! The cavalcade hath scared him: well I knew Somewhat was stirring here! Now, follow close, And cautiously, lest we ourselves be seen! [Exeunt. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Piazza del Granduca.âEnter Chiostro, Cornelio, Macchietti and Dalmasso. Cor. How 'twas, I know not. Macc. You pursued them close? Cor. We did; but at the doubling of a wall We lost them quite. Mass! and they did it well. Macc. 'Tis manifest, from what our wives have told us, Confessing all the mischief of their mirth, Those friars are rascals. Chios. Sir, your recognition Would seem to prove them corsairs, from the coast. But wherefore come they here? Cor. That must we learnâ When we can catch them. But the Prince Giovanniâ How fares he, sir, to-day?âwhen comes he forth? Chios. I have not seen him: access is denied To all, by the Duke's orders. Much I fear Some dangerous fever. Macc. Heaven preserve his life! Cor. (to Dal.) You are silent, sir! Dal. I!âI am very merryâthat's to say, calm. Cor. Calm at the Prince's illness? Dal. (aside). Worry me not: His cause of sickness is a court-secret! Cor. Oh!â (Aloud). Those friars we'll trap: but, tell me, gentlemen, What of Don Garcia's conduct should we think? First seen with one who doth appear their chief; And, as I've learnt this morn, some peasants met him, Ere day-break near the forest, with all three, In social conversation laughing loud, With face the hue of marble in the moon, And earth-marks on his knees! What can we think? Dal. Said you not, soon as he did see the peasants, He join'd them eagerly? Cor. And left the friars, Or corsairs, as they'll proveâstanding perplex'd, Without so much as bidding them good day; Nor look'd he once behind, but hurried on, So that the rest could scarce keep up with him! Chio. 'Tis but his wilful way; there's naught more in it. Cor. Naught more! Macc. What, then? Dal. Sir, shall we know your thoughts? Cor. Nor friars nor corsairs are for him fit peers. Now, gentlemen, I'll tell you candidlyâ Without the least false harmony of disguise, Or any counter-thought beneath my wordsâ Upon my soul I know not what to think! Dal. I know what one might think. Cor. What? Macc. What, my lord? Dal. I shall inform the Duke. Cor. Nay, so shall I: I have a thoughtful tongue. Chios. (smiling). My lords, we'll leave ye To settle who shall teach what neither know. [Exeunt Chiostro and Macchietti. Cor. Your hand, sir! I was rude to you i' the forest. Dal. And elsewhere, oftentimes. Cor. We are old friends. You are a gentleman whom all respect Most justly. Dal. Thank you, sirâfor speaking truth. Cor. Come, tell me now: what of the prince Giovanni? Is he, indeed, so ill? Dal. He might be worse. Cor. Fever!âcan Emperor's daughters drug the wind With influential beauty? Hath he ta'en A fever of love? Dal. I know not of such fever. Cor. Cold sensual! walking nose of Ovid's bust! Why vent'st thou intermittent speech from lips Blue as a monk's within his marble pulpit, Preaching for charity at Christmas-tide! Dal. In vain you rail, sir! Cor. Nayâlet's be serious. If he should die? Dal. (looking round, and lowering his voice). Talk not of that. Cor. Why not? Dal. Because death is an endless argument; Or, if it hath an end, 'twere best not sought. Deep thoughts are ever dangerous, and our fancies Not precipice-proof a whit more than our bodies. E'en as yon river parts the city in two, So reason divides judgment. Cor. Wreck'd o' both shores. Tut! death's the Ducal cosmographic clock, Striking the world's mutationsâwe don't feel it: Or like Achilles' shield; a populous round: It quoits down thousands for the one it saves. Let's to our dinners! Dal. I have a heavy heart. Cor. Think you this sleeve becomes me? Dal. The fogs rise! Cor. Looseâand appropriate? Dal. Ugh!âI am cold. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Corridor of the Ducal Palace.âEnter Cosmo, and an Attendant. Cosmo. Is my son's body placed as I directed? Atten. It is, my liege. Cosmo. The curtain hung in front, Effectually concealing what's behind? Atten. Closely, your Highness; and beyond suspicion, Save to the second-sight of guilt. Cosmo. Ha!âthat is well!âwoe to his body and soul Who knows what's there without examining! Atten. Shall I light tapers round the corse? Cosmo. Noâno! (Aside). He who hath done it will not need a light; For hell's reflexion on his startled soul Will make all clear. Atten. He was a noble planet, Whose body, once so bright, now spotsâ Cosmo. How looks he? Atten. Shadows of decay Fix on the surface: shadows from withinâ Unlike all other shadowsâthat ne'er pass. Cosmo. But bear the substance with them. Hark you, sir! Spare me your moralsâdeath is common, sir; And hath exhausted man's impertinence In words. Atten. But murderâpardon me, my liegeâ That is not common? Cosmo. How!âold man, be silent! Who told thee he was murder'd?âwho dares say so? Atten. I humbly crave your Highness' pardon!âno one! Cosmo. Enough, grey Sapience!âthe plague's in Florenceâ A plague that clots the banners of our house, And will incarnadine the dust of time While heavily they wave. Why stare you thus? Lock up thy gadding tongueâbut mark my orders! Seek privately the Cavalier Dalmasso: Bid him attend me, here i' the corridor, Within two hoursânot sooner, but precise. [Exit Attendant. Now will I go and gaze on my dead son, And in that human ruin see my hopes Ended: our house defrauded of its line, By so much excellence gone into mere clay; Or left, mere clay for its sole sponsor here. What follows next?âhis murderer shall dieâ And speedilyâthat penalty is fix'd. So sure as this my hand did wed his motherâ Most wretched in that demon of her womb; So sure as 'twas his hand his brother slew; So sure by mine he falls! Now solemn prayer, Shall purify and fit me for the hour! [Exit. SCENE III. An Apartment in the Ducal Palace.âEnter Garcia, followed by the Duchess. Duch. This is no answer! Gar. Madam, I have no other. Duch. Then thou art positive in thy denial Of the least knowledge where thy brother is? Gar. Thrice have I told thee so: if I make oath, Thou'lt ask that thrice, as tho' the heavens were deaf And needed iteration! Duch. Oh, my child, What can this mean!âwhat can I do, or say? Gar. Nothing! Duch. My dearest son? Gar. Nothing, will best Become your soft capacity. Duch. My Garcia! Never before to me did'st thou address Such cutting words!âfiery, perchance, at times, On others thou hast darted glances fierce; But ne'er before on me? Gar. Incessantly My life is probed by questions of Giovanni! First comes a courtierââWhere's the Prince Giovanni?â Ere I can answer, that I do not know, His tutor, or some blear astronomer, Tasks me, with book or telescope in hand; And then another, and another courtier! Next comes a courtezan, and asks the same! Duch. Oh, this is false! Gar. When the truth will not serve, 'Tis evident that gossips covet lies? When I reply, no one doth credit me! They shrink away, with lurking looks and shrugs, Pregnant of sinister meaning! Let them think! In vile suspicions doth the devil paint Men's self-bred villany unto themselves; but theyâ Having oil'd consciences, do slip o' one sideâ Think it their neighbour's portrait, and cry âshame!â Duch. Thou rack'st my very heart! Gar. Seek then thy bed, And sleep it whole again. Duch. I e'en must leave thee, If thus thou speak'st? Gar. Good madam, thoud'st best go! Duch. My son!âmy Garcia! Gar. Any whereâI care notâ I am worn out! Duch. What can this mean?âhow end? [Exit. Gar. Thou gentle mother of a savage son, Now thou art dealt with!âI am glad 'tis o'er! First pent within a den, then compass'd round, And spear'd at, constantly, I'm made a tiger! Who could remain a man 'midst all these wounds? Ah me! I'm sick at soul! In these few days I am grown older, both in body and mind, By many a year; and my experience Of life and death has superseded youth, And all its flowers lie like a shower of stones. Even the sweetness of the air is gone: My fever'd breath has changed it. Not for me; Oh not for me comes music in the night With ravishing cadenceâdreamy pulse and pauseâ Revivalâand far-dying. Nature wears A sack-cloth robe, with ashes in her hair, While time doth knot the cord.âWho is't I see? Ippolita!âwhat terror, yet what love! Her presence brings fresh lifeâbut a fresh trial! Wellâ'tis the last. O heart! revive once more, And of thy proper energies create New elements of hope to mould a world Based on the trampled compost of despair, As sun-lit harvests rise where squadrons fell! Enter Ippolita. Ippo. I sought you, Garcia; for I much do fear Giovanni's absence is not, as I had thought, By me occasion'd? Gar. Then by whom, or what? Ippo. By some mischance endangering his life? Gar. (aside). Now shakes the temple of my new-born world. Ippo. You tremble! Gar. Dark mischance surrounds us all. Ippo. You know it, then!âwhat hath befallen him? You left him in the wood? Gar. Trueâthere I left him; And he left me: we partedâthat's the sum Of all I know of him, or he of me. Ippo. Ambiguous are thy words. I feel I never Shall see him any more! Gar. (aside). Now would I fain Religiously repeat his parting blessing, And love to her bequeath'd;âbut how confess That I was present and receiv'd his words? I must notâyet I promis'd sacredly? Ippo. He hath no love for meâhe never hadâ Or could he thus leave torture to supply His dear-felt presence? Gar. Thou art wrong in this. I know he lov'd thee with such depth of soul, That on his bed of death with his last breath He would have call'd down showers of blessings on thee, In token that he left his heart on earth! Ippo. Say'st thou so!âkindest Garcia!âsay'st thou so? Gar. I'm sure of't. Ippo. Then, ye silent darksome walls, That soon will shut me from the useless world, Welcomeâmost welcome! Gar. These are friendly walls, Where every tenant loves thee? Ippo. Soon shall I Leave them for ever. Gar. Whither wouldst thou flee? Ippo. Into a convent's gloom. Gar. A convent!âsurelyâ Ippo. Yesâit is sure as death, or deep-love. Gar. No! Ippo. There will I pray before mine hour-glass, And woo the bony Deathâfarewell! Gar. Noâno! Thou must not do soâdear Ippolita? Ippo. Ah! wherefore should I stay? Gar. Stay to be lovedâ To be adoredâthou must not thus be lost, And leave earth bare of comfort! Ippo. Lost to whomâ Whose comfort, Garcia? Gar. One prince of Florence, Who is not here, Duke Cosmo hath affianced! Another yet remainsâalike devoted! Ippo. (with a piercing look of terror). Garcia! Gar. (wildly). I love thee! Ippo. (shrieks, and retreats). Ah! I see it, now! I see all, now!âlet madness take thy hand And wed it with my curses!âwhere's thy brother? I feel he's dead!âthouâthou hast murder'd him! [Exit, wildly. Gar. Have I embraced a thunder-cloud! Oh man! Combustion of the elements ne'er made So wide a flaw in the vast scheme of things, As passion doth in thee! When some bright star Which we behold adoring, suddenly Explodes, and leaves all dark, that darkness soon New orbs illume: passion hath only one. A murderer did she call me!âfoul, false word!â 'Sdeath! I begin to feel as if 'twere true, And harden in the fact? Nor stand I singly. What's he who slays in battle?âis't not murder? Cornelio boasts he hath kill'd many men; Verani, Basta, all the knights o' the court, Have done the sameâay, and the Duke himself! The cause is naughtâour country's enemies, naughtâ Murderers they are, in motive as in deed! Say, one doth poison a man's wife; the husband Kills him forthrightâthat is a murderer! What is the priest who dooms his soul to fire? A murderer too, and worse! If you do kill The bravo hired to stab you?âno excuse. Or if, in a quarrel, blind with wine, or rage, You slay the man unwittingly, whose hand Falcon'd your throat while his blade glanc'd above, The whole world roars, âThou art a murderer!â As they had roar'd at him if thou'dst been slain. Thus, providential 'scapes are worse than death, And good-luck heinous! Enter an Attendant. Wellâwhat next? Atten. My lord, His Highness waits within his private chamber Your prompt attendance. Gar. (sternly, after some hesitation). I have heard you. [Exit Attendant. What further would the Duke with me?âmy trial Exceeds all condemnationâwhat is this? Methought I had pass'd the worst? Why, so I have! Naught more remains but idle repetition, Queries, conjectures, probabilities. These blows do harden me, and make the deed, Appalling once, seem common as a cloud Wherein great faces frown and fade; my heart Is as a stone that's on the high-way broken By wheels, men, cattleâand I almost feel, With like occasion I could do't again. Terror hath dash'd his torch before mine eyes, Till hell seems ashes; paralysed despair Lies carv'd in ice, outstretch'd before my path; Remorse is beggar'd; scarcely grief remains; And of concealment I am grown so sick, That on my coffin I would gladly sit, SayingââCease all this prateâ'twas I who slew him!â But I have ta'en my stand beyond retreat: This deed, O Cosmo!âit is none of mine! [Exit. SCENE IV. Ante-chamber of the Duke's private apartment. A leaden-grey curtain is drawn across the back of it. Enter Cosmo, from behind the curtain. Cosmo. The solid earth beneath me seems to rock; Yet will not I!âlike Justice, will I stand Upon mine own foundationâsteel'd in right! And thouâO, vast marmoreal arch above! Whereon the luminous host in silence range; Glorified giants and portentous powers, Coeval, coeternal with the spheresâ Who gaze with solar face on this my deed; O, spanning arch! yawn thou, and let heaven down, To crush me ere I do't, if I be wrong! Enter Garcia. Gar. (after a pause). Sir, I am here. Cosmo (advancing close, and fixing his eyes upon him). Art worthy to be here? Shouldst thou not rather be within thy tomb? Gar. I rather would be there. Cosmo. Wherefore wouldst rather? Gar. Because, sir, I am sick of this vile life Which I am made to lead by constant questions Touching my brother's absence. Whereso'er I turn, suspicions fang me; words are fangs, And looks are wordsâtherefore I'm sick of life. Cosmo. Thou dost anticipate me, and thy craft Equals thy fix'd audacity. Gar. What craft? Cosmo. Come, let's be brief: you know Giovanni's murder'd! Gar. Murder'd, my lord!âimpossible! Cosmo. Thou did'st it! Thou art the murderer! Gar. What hideous liar Hath blown this monstrous seed in your quick ear? Cosmo. Thou hast a demon's tongue, oh, iron-faced boy, That should be rooted from its upas hold, And cast to hungry imps! I know thou did'st it! Gar. Then may your Highness listen to these facts: Cornelio and Dalmasso are both murderersâ And all the rest who follow'd to your wars! My mother is a murderess, in that she Hath wish'd success to wars her kin have waged! Then, there's Ippolitaâa murderess too; Self-sacrificed, and in a convent buried! And those who ne'er have done a deed of death, Have oft in private thoughts imagined it From causes trivial that have stirr'd their passions: Even the child who strikes intends to kill! Thus, all the worldâ Cosmo. Boy! boy! no more!âthou utterest Words, the base coin of self-deceptive fiends. I have a picture here of ancient date, Which looks eternalâplaced beyond time's hand. [Leading him towards the curtain. It was thy mother's gift when first we married, And hath been treasur'd since most sacredly. A solemn lesson doth the subject teach To erring mortals: recognizeâacknowledge! [He throws aside the curtain, and discovers the form of Giovanni laid upon a marble slab. Garcia utters no cry; but rushes down to the front, followed by Cosmo, who points to his face.] Gar. (after a pause of horror). I did it! Cosmo. Oh unnatural government, That in a mental den lock'd up such deed! How doth it force itself thro' the cold pores Of that metallic mask, and curdle there! Garcia! thy soul is lost! Gar. (abstractedly). It is the form Of my unburied brother!âpeaceful heaven Cherish his soul, and let it plead my cause! Cosmo. Thy cause, oh murderous boy! Gar. I am no murderer! Cosmo. Now dost thou snatch the earth from under me, And leave me grappling space!âhast thou not said Thou did'st it? Gar. Father, it is true he fell In our fierce struggleâelse I had not been here, My chance to curse! Cosmo. What villainous evasion Wouldst thou insinuate? Speak, ere I slay thee; For self-command will burst my inner world, And chaos whelm us both! Gar. He first attack'd me! And in mine own defence, I know not how, Madly I parried himâI am innocent! Cosmo. Monstrous untruth! thou wretch unparallel'd! Too well I know thy brother's sweetest nature Could ne'er have been so changed. Approach yon form! [Cosmo leads him towards the body. Nearerâmore near! âDoth not the sullen blood Revivify, and leave its kindred earth, Acknowledging the presence of the Destroyer!â Gar. I see the sullen blood there fix'd, congeal'd; I do not see it flow!âtake, take away My senses from meâdo not harrow them, Until I own what is not! Cosmo. Garcia! Garcia! It is enough.ââBehold thy brother's blood! It cries aloud for vengeance on thy head, Waiting heaven's mandate, ministered by me! Oh, wretched father of a fratricideâ Whom by all laws of justice I am bound To render up to Death's capacious handâ How wretched is surviving! But dream not That as an impious and unequal judge My people shall impugn me. It is better That future times should call me barbarous In this my private act, than as a sovereign Weak and unjust. Therefore prepare to die!â Gar. Under what awful impulse dost thou act? Cosmo (pointing upwards). Under Authority! Gar. Life's worthless to meâbut to end it thusâ You do deceive yourselfâyet hear me, father! Show me the proof of this high mission? Cosmo. There!â I am the father of that corpse! Gar. (clasping his hands). I know it, sir; and IâI am its brother! Cosmo. Dar'st thou so call thyself, who art, his murderer? Gar. I'm no such wretchâand yet a wretch who cares not How soon he die! Cosmo. That moment now is come! [He draws forth Garcia's broken sword. Gar. Horrible death! by these cold, pausing stepsâ Silent as heaven before the earth was madeâ Yet thundering in the brain, as they advance, Like slow, but final judgment! Do not kill me! Cosmo. Not finalâsave on earth. Gar. You will not kill me! You cannot mean it!âI have done no wrong. Cosmo. How! with yon weltering witness? Gar. Heaven take me home! I see itâsee nothing elseâWell, well, all's o'erâ I care not, sir! I steadily tell you that! Brother, I pardon thee! 'twas thy good chance To die and not to suffer as I have done: We shall be reconciled within the tomb! Cosmo. Look up, ye fiends!âbehold this broken blade! Doth not the fragment pierce thine inmost sense With this last proof? Gar. I have nought more to say. Cosmo. âUnnatural boy, 'tis fit thy course should cease, Lest all thy family thou shouldst cut off, Or blank their prospects and eclipse their fame;â Choking their sun with blood, and causing tears To fall where clarion'd glories should arise! Leagued with fell bandits and with pirate hordes, Perchance e'en now they hover round our gates With bosom-heated steel. Gar. God is my judge! Cosmo. In heaven;âbut first on earth it is ordain'd There should be judges to arraign men's deeds, And send the guilty hence to the Court Supreme! Farewell, O, wretched son!âI cannot give A father's blessingâyetâmy sonâfarewell! [Garcia kneels, and Cosmo embraces, and hangs fondly over him: then lifts himself up, and raises the sword towards heaven.] âThou constant God! sanction, impel, direct The sword of Justice!âand for a criminal son That pardon grant which his most wretched father Thus in the hour of agony implores!â [The scene closes; the tableau of the figures previously presenting a partial resemblance to statuary, or a monumental design, in the position, the pallid look and the immobility of the group, together with the form and colour of the dresses and draperies. The scene should be addressed to the imagination and the passions, rather than to the eye.] SCENE V. A Corridor of the Ducal Palace.âEnter Duchess. Duch. Oh, wherefore left I Garcia in that moodâ So changed from all he was!âWhere is he now? Would I could find him, for my trembling frame Tells me some dreadful things are hovering round Whose fall will make us shriek ere we know why! The Duke!âwith mighty bounds this way he comes! And looks as though he had just seen a ghost! What!âwhat!âif he be moved to leap the earth, Earth's centre's lost! [Retreats in terror. Cosmo rushes in. Cosmo. He's saved from worse than death! His fame is saved!ââunto his father's hand He hath resign'd that life his father gave!â No horrible public executioner Hath seal'd disgrace upon our ancient house. My wife! ha!âwhat's the matter? Duch. Oh, my lord! Howâhow is this? what can have made you thus? Cosmo (recovering himself loftily). How thus! Duch. Whereâwhere is Garcia?âwhere?â I left him recently in fearful stateâ His nature hath been gall'dâI fear he's madâ For God's sake, tell meâtell me where he is? Cosmo (agitated). Good mother of my sonsâwe all at times Border on madness; nay, in sooth, we're madâ And but it lasts not, men would call us so, And chain our damn'd magnificence of will! RetireâI will be left aloneâretire! Duch. My heart-strings strainâstrain!âGarcia! where art thou? [Exit Duchess. Cosmo. He'll answer her no moreâsave from the air! What if that echo be his voice, not hers? (Duchess calling within). Whereâwhere is Garcia! Cosmo. With the all-merciful God! (Duchess calling within). Garcia! Cosmo. The walls do render back the sound! What if the earth should open at my feet, And he himself make answer, âI am here!â Then should his mother ask, âWho plac'd thee there?â Can I stand upright, saying who it was? I could!âbut not to herâno, not to her! Enter Dalmasso. Away! Dal. Your Highness did commandâ Cosmo. Trueâtrue: Your pardon, sir. Thou'st kept the secret close? Dal. My liege, I have. Cosmo. Forth now, and publicly Announce this dolorous news throughout the city; That, of the pestilence, our dear loved sons, Giovanni and young Garcia, are both dead! Dal. Both dead, my lord? Cosmo. Did'st thou not hear me say it? A bell tolls in my brain as for earth's end: They are both dead! Dal. Your HighnessâI crave pardonâ Cosmo. See that all honours, fitting their princely state, With high oration and sad ceremony, Be straight prepared? Dal. Religiously, my liege. Yet will your Highness bear with me, if now, At such a moment, I intrude to tell How that the corsair Zacheo is arrested, With two of his band. Is it your will to order Their execution? Cosmo. No, no, no!â'tis hideous! No more of executions. They are pardon'd! Dal. And for their future conductâ Cosmo. Set them all free! Death hath two noble gifts, and well can wait For the flaw'd casts from man's precarious mould. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Gardens of the Ducal Palace. Sun-set.âEnter Luigi del Passato. Passa. These splendours seem to me like sugar'd fruitsâ Palling the purity of Nature's taste And integral design. It is far better, So one hath just enough for means of life, To set one's back against an aged tree On some fair hill, and thence survey below Sweet sylvan streams, with many a snow-white bridge, Vines, olive-yards, pine-groves, and basking gardens, And in the fertile, fresh-green distance winding Slow o'er the fragrant mead, the oxen-teamsâ Than be their Ducal lord. Cosmo hath lost Two sons, the nearest to his sovereign hopes, By one 'ghast fever, at the self-same time: What's Cosmo's state? Fair-haired young Garcia, A cold clay image now, of graceless shape, Had that within him might have sunn'd the world: What's Cosmo's dukedom to his double loss? Of no more value than a bunch of grapes! Far less, when men are thirsty, or the eye Wanders tow'rds Arcady. Enter Chiostro. Chios. Dark be the sunâ The heavens a domed tomb, to house this loss! Passa. I've heard it, sirâGarcia and Giovanni Stand pale upon one slab! Chios. That is not allâ The Duchess' heart is broken! She was found Extended senseless near the half-closed door Of the Duke's private chamber, whence it seem'd She had just issued. In his Highness' arms She breathed her last; but utter'd not a word. Pass. Ah! there's the sweetness of nobility, Crown'd with high feeling. How is't with the Duke? Chios. Oh, sir, he hath a tower of man within! Ravaged by storms that howlingly sweep through, He shakesâbut falls not. His passions are his slaves! Being humane, 'tis reason'd will, alone, That makes man great with high security. Such power hath Cosmo. Fareâfare you well, sir! I go to write the oration with my tears. [Exit. Pass. Would I could weep: my heart hath got a load Which blessed tears might lighten and disperse. 'Tis Cosmo yonder! Darkly and tall he stands, Like an extinguish'd beacon of the night, Whose watchman hath been cast into the sea. Hither he moves. [Passato seats himself on a bank. Enter Cosmo, in a sable robe. Cosmo. Vast is the bosom of heaven: Descended thence, man thither should aspire: There only can grief breathe, and find repose. I am not calm; I struggle without aim: I walk with fortitude as with a friend; But feel that one of us is false. Who's here? Sir, do not rise; I know you very well. You are a sculptor: I will sit by you! [Seats himself beside Passato. Pass. Not grief alone hath made your Highness gracious. Cosmo. I thank you: I am grateful for that truth; And I feelâsir, I feelâmuchâvery much. You know my recent losses: though you are not A father or a husband, as I think, Yet you can enter into what I feel, In some degree. Pass. Entirely, my liege. Cosmo. That is impossible!âpardon me, sir; You do not know. I was about to say, That as it seem'd my son, sirâmy son Garciaâ And you, were friends; and that Giovanni held youâ As do I alsoâgreatly in esteem For your chaste works, I would at once propose That you should rear a monument, and give it The utmost of your nature? Pass. With devotion My soul shall move my hand. Cosmo. A high designâ Clearly made out, though broad in its effects? Pass. Clear as the story thou wouldst have me tell. Cosmo (starting up.) Ha!âdost thou hint at aught beyond thy words!â I wander with my sonsâI am not wellâ The air of the garden and the scent o'the plants Affect me strongly. [The Duke sits down again. Pass. Good, my lordâ'tis common. Cosmo (hurriedly.) Listen: I'd have them all as life-sized figuresâ Death's standard there's no quarry that could furnishâ The Duchessâboth my sonsâGiovanni, Garciaâ Somewhat to tell my grief, if aught can tell it, And also that of lost Ippolita; In short, sir, you may place us all as dead! Now, your design? Pass. That needs some time, my lord. Cosmo. Thou said'st thy soul was in it? Pass. So it is; But yet my mind's unform'd: 'twill be the work Of serious years, and cannot in a minute Spring from the brain fit to stand fast through ages. Cosmo (rising hurriedly.) I'm sick, I'm sick at heart! Find years elsewhere! Sculpture the almanackâI will have naught! [Retires abruptly. Pass. (coming forward.) I tire of the court: I am unfit for it; Its patronage is irksome, for it savours Of orders from above, and hath in all things Too much vitality to suit my taste. Why should my natural moods be call'd eccentric, While rich men's starts and humours pass for law? The Duke is great and generous; yet methinks It ill suits greatness in philosophy, Because his kin have sought their natural rest Some seasons prematurely, thus to rave? I will return to mine obscurity, To stand upon some cliff that goat ne'er hoof'd, And watch old eagles and the sinking sun; Or in primeval twilight of deep groves, 'Midst satyrane trees and silence, shape my clay; Companion shadowsâand commence with Time. [Exit. Cosmo , (slowly coming forward.) I lose myself: what wonder, having lost So much that's better? I have outlived all hopes. [He pauses despondingly. On the grey slope of life, when friends fall off, And e'en the fresh flowers and the clouds look old; When natural sweets are bitter in the mind, Hope dying of sick memory soon as born, And beauty, like a lily's pure, cold urn, Standing in Lethe's waters, wakes no sense To ravishment, no thoughts to urge our steps; While grief, experience, and oblivion, In sequence old, come to dismiss the heart; Mighty revealings of an after-state Flit through the brain, and sobbings fill the ear From the great winds' quadruple origin, And make man fear himself. But Justice reigns! Creation and destruction are the extremes, With all the heavens for centre. Still, we shudder: Yet one power holds. Unwavering consciousness Of general practice in humanity, Is all that shores us up against the eye Of deep self-scrutiny; the only power Which can enable man, howe'er appall'd, To look his own being, steadily in the face. Enter two Officers, and Zacheo, in his Pirate's dress; with a few links of chain hanging from his wrist. 1st Off. My liege! 2nd Off. So please your Highness! Cosmo. Who art thou? Zach. I am the corsair, Zacheo Barossa, The infidel who with his daring crew Hath ravaged long the coast of Tuscany. I am come to thank you for my life! Cosmo. Goâmend it! Zach. Cosmo, the state and power thou hold'st are noble; Far nobler in thy use: great is thy nature, Tho' thou'rt a Christian whom I ought to hate; Yet, could a lawless corsair do thee service Thou'dst not receive it, so I'll take my leave, And close as rock-veins hold thy present secret. Cosmo. Man! Zach. It is safe: the plague sometimes takes Princes. Cosmo. Hath it not ta'en my sons? Zach. So 'tis reported. [Cosmo waves his hand. Exeunt Officers. Cosmo. I have not 'scaped myself, tho' I do live. Zach. Save thee, great Cosmo! Cosmo (with impatient hauteur). Hence! and mend thy life! Zach. I crave thy pardon if I've anger'd thee; Still more because thy royal heart is griev'd; But as I only saw the Princes fight, I thoughtâ Cosmo (with wild earnestness). Fight!âsaw them fight!âthou witness'd it? Zach. I did. Cosmo. (clasping his hands). A witness!âan earthly witness!âI did think There had been but One! Zach. (reverently). Allah doth know I saw it! The elder first drew steel. Cosmo. No!âno!âhe could not! Thine eyes deceiv'd theeâ'twas my youngest sonâ A whirlwind take thy words!âthe elder youth Was of a natural mildness, passing sweet. Do not confound my soul!âhe was most gentle! Zach. Of that I nothing know; but this I do knowâ He gave the first offence, and urged his words, Taunting the other for his boyish years. They quarrell'd who first smote the boar; and next About some lady, whom it seem'd both loved; And then the elder drew, and hurl'd at him; The otherâparrying only, till his choler, Boil'd up with some sharp wrench, perchance a cut,â Made play with's brittle rapier, till it flew. The rest was all confused; the end scarce tells it. Whether lord Garcia dealt a mortal blow, Or that his brother rush'd against the point, I know not. Were both living, I believe Neither could tell you more. Cosmo. (stunned and appalled). Thou'st told sufficient! Zach. I met lord Garciaâshew'd him I knew his deed; Then sought he aid from me forthwith to bury His brother's body, lest his parents' hearts Should doubly bleedâ Cosmo. Tell me no more!âno more! Zach. I kneel, my liege; and go. Cosmo. Monster! no more! Could'st thou un-say by any form of words, Here would I standâbecome a hollow rockâ And live but in my echoes! 'Tis too clear! Quit me! [Exit Zacheo. And take my thanksâfor thou hast curs'd me With my son's innocence whom I have slain! Is't really done?âOh! done beyond recal. His mother's death sums up and proves the account, Sinking heaven's balance down into the grave, While all my motives fly like blights i'the air. I feel most curs'd!âdark iron-crown'd spectres wave Swords, and the storied banners of our house, Where all is told! My atmosphere of guilt Inflatesâcollapsesâpants like dreamy hell At some strange pause and shifting of its pains! Now Justice rise! arm thou some shadowy form To make me pay my debt, thus doubly due, And one large grave hold Cosmo and his sons! [Exit. SCENE VII. Interior of the Chapel of San Lorenzo. Three biers, each bearing a covered form, are elevated pyramidally, in the centre. Priests, Nobles, Monks, Ladies, &amp;c. are ranged on each side. The organ breathes forth a heavenly strain. Enter Ippolita, clad in a long black veil. Ippo. Not all the hopes and pleasures of the world Can pour one drop of balm on such a loss. Mine eyes, dear friends! are blind with scalding tears That shut out natureâall, save misery. Sigh not for me, that in a convent's cell I wall up lifeâmy heart doth share yon bier! Enter Chiostro and Dalmasso, attired in mourning. Chios. These losses, and the centre of his heart Thus suddenly transpiercedâblow following blow With rapid agonies commingling wild, Scatter all fortitude, which ever needs Some interval ere it regain its poise. Dal. The Duke can ne'er recover this! It is A trial passing human energy. Chios. Within this hour he seems to have lost himself, Like Saturn wandering thro' a wilderness; Or he doth stand, a solid Dismay! How different He look'd when Titian painted him!âO, grief! Thou can'st entomb Osiris in a cloud, And to black beamy shadows and ruins change The architectural Day! Yet, he'll not fall! Dal. (aside). There is a hideous mine beneath the earth, And a dark spirit tracks him, pace for pace! [The organ plays a solemn dirge.] Enter Cosmo, attired in black velvet; his face all pale, and with disordered hair. Cosmo (advancing slowly and abstractedly). My lofty and firm motives that once held United as the Alps, are changed i' the acting To martyr'd ashesâstaked humanity! This world's a bubble: see! where now it bursts, And men and things fly off, and melt in air! Yon spheres are temporal, and a yawn will end The Ptolemaic dream! Our brain's mere dust, Moisten'd and moved by rays and dews from heaven; Soon darkâdryâvoid!âCreation's final lordâ Oblivion, crown'd with infinite blank starsâ Inherits all! I've done a hydra wrong! Now will its monstrous constellation blazon My deed, till heaven dissolve! Priest. My liege! Chios. Your Highness! Cosmo (still in abstraction). Could I do otherwise?âI might have waited! Peace, Garcia!âleave me! Dal. (aside to Chios.) Hear you that, of Garcia? Chios. Did he say, leave me? Cosmo. Still my soul is strong, And fights up hill against an armed Conscience. In vain!âthe constant effort proves it vain! Thus nature's secret single-combat mars The strength of man, which else might brave the spheres With Atlas 'neath his heel. Now, all is o'er! Priest. My lord! Cosmo. I am cast backwardâne'er to rise. All that had made me greatâis gone! Chios. My liege! A Noble. May't please your illustrious Excellency! Cosmo. Mock not mine agonyâmock not my state! (Recovering himself). Soâthey are there!âmy wifeâmy dear lost sons! My noble hope, Giovanni, snatch'd away! My dear boy, Garciaâprematurely snatch'd! (To the Priests). Pardon me!âlet your sacred rites proceed! [A lofty chair is placed for the Duke.] No!âI'll sit here. [Seats himself in a Confessional.] Priest. Commence the solemn service! MASS. Celestial beams dry up our grief, While these bright spirits now ascend; Our hearts pour forth but for reliefâ We know their life can never end! No stain, no guilt is theirs: Then purify our prayers, And clear our soulsâ Cosmo starts forward. The Mass pauses abruptly. Cosmo. This mass I like not!âit is vagueâdefective, And most reproachful! Cease it on the instant! How should my prayers be pure? Yet, wherefore not? Giovanni died of pestilenceâso did Garcia; By a worse pestilence cut offâan error, As monstrous, dark, and pagod-like in state, As the united sense of right is vast In all its bright proportions! Priest. Good, my liege! Chios. (aside). Grief hath disturb'd his brain. Dal. (aside). What he hath done Is now too plain. How terrible a secret For his appall'd successor's ear! Chios. (to Priest). Speak to him. Lo! where his heavy scalding tears pour down! Cosmo (with forlorn dignity). Continue! Noble gentlemen and friends, I cannot explain these things. My present state Savours too much o'the elements. 'Tis a story Such as in pealing thunder might be toldâ Yet better lost in echoes o'er the sea, Since none can thoroughly know what's in the soul. Pray ye, excuse me! I am not much in years; And tho' this morn methought my hair look'd grey, 'Tis but a few nights' snows. Yet, sorrow is strong, And I an unarm'd and a childless man. Once more, your pardon. [He advances to the lofty chair placed for him.] Let the mass proceed! [Seats himself. MASS. From depths of gloom and grief Seek not a vain relief, Till the heart's heavy load o'erflow; But grant us strength, O Heaven! to bear This weight of agony and fear That presses down the atmosphere, And round our brows with searing glow Clings like the leaden crown of Woe! [As the Mass concludes, Cosmo falls back in the chair.] Dal. The Duke!âhe faints! All. The Duke! [Nobles and attendants rush towards him. Cosmo. 'Tis well. Great God, thou knowest! [Dies. Chios. (After a solemn pause). There spedâon mighty wings, o'erspanning all This nether globeâthe noblest soul that e'er Stoic, or Platonist, or sage full-hearted, Framed in imagination of the just, And man's immortal destiny made clear By mortal practice, superseding death. There broke a solid heart! Drop we no tears On this colossal wreck; or, while our eyes Play rebel to high thoughts, close, close his lids, So their stain'd orbs reflect not this our weaknessâ Needful as rain to those who dwell on earth. [The scene slowly descends, displaying the whole extent of the Piazza del Granduca, with the grand equestrian statue in bronze of Cosmo the First, as it stands there at the present time.] THE END.</field>
