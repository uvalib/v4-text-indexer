After the victory that Iephte gott agaynst the Ammonites a great sedition raysed was agaynst hym by the Ephraits who threatned for to burne his house though no iust cause they had there of, but pickt a quarell agaynst hym &amp; the men of Galaad. But Iephte when that no myld answeare would Ephraim appease but rather did agaynst all reason them more &amp; more displease, The Galaadits he wt h hym tooke &amp; mett them in the field where of them two &amp; twenty thousand deseruedly hee kild Amongst whom that flede, requested them to lett hym passe protestinge earnestly to them that he no Ephrait was. They bade hym then schibboleth pronounce (wc h ys an eare of corne) Sibboleth quoth he (for none of them that were in Ephraim borne were able to expresse an eare of corne by the same letter) wherefore immediatly they kild hym as they had the other. And when for the space of Six yeares Iephte had Israel iudged he dyed, &amp; in his place Abesan of Ephraim hym succeeded, who thirty sonnes &amp; thirty Daughters had, wc h he bestowed in mariage, &amp; dyed when he seuen yeares had Israel iudged. And after hym Ahialon iudg'd Israel for ten yeares space, &amp; dyed then: And Abdon was elected in his place, whom god did blesse wt h fourty sonnes &amp; thirty Nephews also mounted vpon seuenty Asse colts, for vsually they rydd so: &amp; eight yeares he did Israel iudge, &amp; this lyfe departed &amp; since his death Israel agayne agaynst our Lor[d] hath synned for wc h god hath deliuered them vp into the philisthijmes hands who now full fourty yeares haue prayd vpon them &amp; their lands And what redresse here after they shall fynd as yet's not knowne but listen &amp; yt will appeare in tyme: so I'l be gone. Vxor Manue. Who's this wt h such a terrible face &amp; countenance Angelicall? Whence do you come, &amp; by what name (good sir) may I you call? Angell Good woman Manues wyfe of saraa, &amp; the stocke of Dan thou barren art, &amp; children wants, but thou by thy goodman conceiue shall &amp; bringe forth a sonne. wherefore see thou refrayne drynke of sicer &amp; wyne, &amp; all such meates as are vncleane because thou shalt conceiue &amp; beare a sonne, whose head the raser shall not touch, for from's infancy &amp; the wombe of his mother he shall a Nazarite be of god, &amp; begin to deliuer the Israelits out of the cruell phylisthijms hands &amp; power Vxor Manue What are you gone? Husband I wish you had come somewhat sooner then might you haue a man of god seene that came to me hither, whose countenance lyke to an Angels was exceedinge terrible but when I askt his name, &amp; whence he came, he would not tell. Only he sayd: Behold thou shall conceiue, &amp; a sonne beare. see thou eate no meate that's vncleane, nor drinke any wyne or sicer for the child shall a Nazarite be of good euen from his infancy &amp; from his mothers wombe vntill the day that he shall dy Manue Lord let the man of god whom thou did send agayne returne to teach vs what to do vnto the child that shall be borne. Now wyfe occasions draw me hence, I'l leaue thee here alone. Vxor manue. Husband god speede you well: &amp; after you I'l come anone. Good lord I see thou hast graunted the prayer of my husband for here's the man of god agayne. I'l lett hym vnderstand. Lo husband where he ys. Man[ue]. Art thou be that spake to the woman? Angell I am. Man[ue]. when thy worde shall fulfilled be acquaint me than what will thou that the child shall do? or from what things shall hee hym self refrayne? Ang[ell]. from all things that I to thy wyfe did specify. Nothinge that of the vinyard groeth lett hym haue for his meate, nor wyne nor sicer drynke, nor any thinge that's vncleane eate Manue I pray the graunt me this: a kidd of goats let's make vnto thee Angell Assure thy self I will not eate thy breade yf thou constrayne mee. but yf thou wil't a holocaust make offer yt vnto our lord Manue What's thy name that I may the honour, yf fulfild be thy word. Angell Wherefore dost thou demaund what my name ys, the wc h ys merueilous? Manue Then will I sacrifice vnto our lord which doth things wonderous. Vxor manue. Looke husband looke he vp to heauen ascendeth wt h the flame. Manue. yt was no man, but th'Angell of our lord that to vs came: &amp; dyinge we shall dye because we haue our lord god seene. Vxor manue. yf that our lord would vs haue kild our holocaust had not bene by hym receiued at our hands: neyther would he haue shewed vs all these things, nor to vs haue the things to come declared. Manue Thou sayst well wyfe: but syth hee's gone, we'l also hence depart Vxor manue. Go when, &amp; whither you will, I'l waite on you wt h all my hearte. Nuncius You must imagin now that many yeares are past &amp; gone &amp; that to Manue s borne (as th'Angell did fore tell) a sonne, who Samson's cald &amp; ys at mans estate, &amp; of god blessed &amp; strengthned wt h his spirit, &amp; vnto Thamnatha's descended where wt h one of the philisthijms daughters he fallen ys in loue: but yt rests doubtfull yet whether yt a match or none will bee for his parents vnwillinge are to geue there to consent syth wt h the gentils Israel may not marrie by gods commandment. But what th'euent there of will be, yf you will geue attention shall streight appeare: &amp; so adew, for hence I must be gone. Samson Father manue in Thamnatha I saw a philisthijms daughter your fauours both I craue that I vnto my wyfe may haue her Manue of all thy brethrens daughters &amp; my people can thou not make a wyfe, but of th'vncircumced philisthijms one will take? Samson. Take this for me: for only shee to myne eyes geues content Vxor manue. We would but that yt ys for bydden playnly by gods commandment Samson yt's true shee sayth that marriage wt h the gentils ys prohibited yet god wt h me (vnknowne to them) at this tyme hath dispensed: for by this match agaynst the philisthijms I do seeke occasion to be reueng'd, because they ouer Israell haue dominion yet here wt h I'l acquaint neyther my father nor my mother but humbly them intreate agayne for to let me inioy her: Once more I do beseech you both wt h me downe for to go to Thamnatha, &amp; on this woman in marriage me bestow Manue yt's lyke wyfe this his suite proceedes from god, wherefore we will go downe wt h hym: Sonne Samson come, thy mynd we will fulfill. Nuncius Now Samson vnto Thamnatha ys wt h his parents gone &amp; when that they were come vnto the vinyards of the Towne a cruell Lions whelpe did roaringe meete hym as he went. whom (gods spirit vpon Samson cominge) he al to peeces rent as though yt had bene but a kydd, in his hand haueinge nothinge &amp; neyther made father nor mother there of priuy at their meetinge. And after fewe days goinge agayne to her whom his eyes lyked he went a syde to see the Lions carcasse wc h he had killed: In whose mouth was a swarme of bees, &amp; hony combe wc h he sucked &amp; to his parents comminge parte there of to them imparted, who also eate there of: but to them would not make yt knowne that he had taken that same hony from the mouth of the Lion. Then went his father to the woman &amp; a great feast prepared for his sonne as the custome was, &amp; the citizens appoynted thirty yonge men t'accompany hym: &amp; what more will be done shall by them selues declared bee, &amp; there fore I'l be gone. Samson frendes &amp; companions I will now propose to you a ridle the wc h yf you wt hin the seuen days of the feast be able to solue, Thirty syndons, &amp; as many coats I'l geue to you But yf you reede yt not, as many on mee you shall bestow Strutho content we are: propound the ridle, that we may heare the same Samson Out of the eater meate, &amp; sweetenes forth of the stronge came. phorbus Samson this Ridle's hard, &amp; sodaynly can not be solued Yet we hope we shall reede the same wt h in the tyme prefixed &amp; to consult there on in the meane space we'l hence begone Samson So do, &amp; when you are resolu'd tell me your resolution the while I'l to my parents go, who do expect my presence as I appoyntment made wt h them before that I came thence. Strutho. Since Samson did propose his ridle six days are fully complete &amp; the seuenth day ys come, &amp; yet we can not yt interprete wherefore we must be forct to go vnto the wyfe of Samson &amp; will her to persuade her husband to tell her the solution &amp; vs then to acquaint there wt h. &amp; here shee comes as fittly as wee could wishe. Birsa the wyfe of samson let's intreate thee to go vnto thy husband &amp; persuade hym for to tell to thee wt h out delay th'interpretation of his ridle that thou may yt declare to vs: wc h yf thou wilt not do we'l burne thee &amp; thy fathers house. Haue you cald vs vnto the Bridall that you might vs spoyle, &amp; bringe vs to destruction Birsa yonge men contented be, &amp; I'l directly go to Samson &amp; that of hym intreate, &amp; yt impart to you agayne phorbus So do, &amp; we will be neither thyne nor thy fathers bane Birsa. Husband yt seemes you loue me not, wc h to my griefe ys spoken &amp; therefore all this while to my request you did not herken but haue refus'd from tyme to tyme the ridle to expounde to me, wc h you to the sonnes of my people did profound Samson ffrom myne owne father &amp; my mother I did conceale the same: &amp; then in keepinge yt from thee how should I be to blame? Birsa yt's nothinge to me what you did to them: but yf you loue mee expound this probleme vnto me, else for griefe I shall dye. Samson I will yt to the tell for to avoyde this molestation. What sweeter ys then hony, &amp; what is stronger then a lion Birsa Thankes hushand: now I know assur'd that you do loue me well in that you haue voutsafte this secret vnto me to tell Samson And as thou loues me vnto none see that thou yt discouer Birsa Not to the dearest frende I haue though yt were myne owne father Samson yf thou do as thou sayst yt's well, &amp; so let vs begone Birsa Husband go you before, &amp; I'l come after you a none. So now he hath to me declard the secrets of his ridle I'l yt reveale wt h out delay to the sonnes of my people. who now are cominge here, as yt should seeme very sore perplexed lest the sunne should be sett before they haue this ridle solued. by reason of the forfeyture dependinge there vpon Strutho. Birsa well mett: can thou solue yet this doubtfull proposition? Birsa What sweeter ys then hony? &amp; then a Lion what ys stronger? This I of samson learn'd, who bade me tell ytt to no other. So fare you well for here he'l bee hym self wt h you a none to see yf that ere the sunne sett you can resolue his question. Samson My frendes well mett, can you solue yet the probleme I proposed? or will you yield ingeniously your selues to be euicted? phorbus. What sweeter ys then hony? &amp; then the lion what ys stronger Samson. You had not redd my ridle yf you had not plough'd wt h my heyfer But syth I haue the wager lost, yt shall discharged bee wherefore let's in returne, &amp; I will satisfy you presently Nuncius The spirit of god on samson came when he from them departed &amp; streight to Ascalon he went, where thirty men he killed: whose garments he did take away &amp; gaue them vnto them (accordinge to the bargayne made) who solued had his question &amp; vp vnto his fathers house he went in raginge passions but his wyfe tooke to husband one of his bridall companions. Yet afterward when the days of wheate haruest were at hand Samson went for to visit his wyfe as became a kynd husband wc h when her father vnderstoode in no wyse he would suffer Samson for to go into her after his vsuall maner sayinge he was persuaded that he had his daughter hated &amp; therefore he vnto a frend of his had her deliuered. But I quoth he an other daughter haue yonger &amp; fayrer whom take thou for thy wyfe if yt please thee in steede of th'other. Not so sayd samson but from this day forward I am free to do the Philisthijms all the hurt I can by might or policy &amp; then he went &amp; caus'd three hundred foxes to be catched &amp; coupled them tayle to tayle, &amp; burninge fire brands to them tyed &amp; so did let them go, as fury dryue them for to runne hopeinge thereby (as yt fell out) Philisthijmes would be vndone. for they into the philisthijms corne wt h out stay went directly. &amp; sett yt on a fyre, &amp; all the corne was burn'd vp presently &amp; the vinyards &amp; oliuets also were wt h the flame spoyled as yt by Samson was, when he ye foxes caught, intended And when the Philisthijms knew yt Samson was thereof causer for yt his wyfe was from hym taken, &amp; geuen to an other both the woman &amp; her fathers house they went &amp; forth wt h burned. yet not wt h standinge samson threatned on them to be reuenged for fully he persuaded was that all this they had done was not for iustice sake, but did proceede only of passion. And by hym synce that tyme wt h a great plague they stryken bee so yt astonied they calfe of their legge layd on the thigh. And Samson now in the caue of the rocke of Elam dwelleth &amp; in Iuda all the whole multitude of the philisthiims campeth but to what issue these things will come here after shall be knowne yf that you will attentyue be a while, so I'l begone.

But till midnight he slept, &amp; then arysinge the citty gate, leaues, posts, &amp; locke he on his shoulders caryed to the top of a mountayne where he lefte them, &amp; escaped. And since that tyme in loue he's fallen wt h Dalila a woman who in the valley Sorec dwells, to whom the Philisthijms ran so soone as they did heare there of, &amp; seriously intreated her for to learne of Samson in what thinge his strength consisted &amp; how they might hym bynde wt h faythfull promise for to geue her yf shee bringe yt to passe a mighty masse &amp; summe of syluer But whether she can yt effect or no as yet's not knowne but shortly will; for see Dalila here comes woeinge of Samson Dalila Samson myne owne sweete heart tell me accordinge to your promise what kynd of band thou canst not breake, &amp; where in thy strength ys Samson yf wt h seuen cords of vndryed sinews I should be tyed then myne owne deare Dalila I should be in strength lyke other men Dalila That will I try for seuen such cordes I will fetch hither presently.

This ioyfull newes for to impart to them I will be gone Dalila Lo now they cominge are. The philisthijms vpon the Samson Samson Then I'l ryse vp &amp; shake my self as I haue bene accustomed Alas my strength's decaid: I feare our lord's from me departed Binzo Come princes let's lay hold of hym, for now his strength ys gone Larmus Then neede we not to feare hym as we formerly haue done Topas Yet not wt h standinge let's pull out his eyes for more security &amp; bynd hym fast in cheynes, &amp; then to Gaza hym streight cary &amp; there lay hym in prison, &amp; make hym in the myll to grinde Binzo Your counsel's good; we will so do: Lo now he ys starke blynde &amp; both his hands fast tyed wt h cheynes. Now haue we at the length hym ouercome, &amp; subiect made to vs for all his strength Larmus for that to Dalila we beholdinge are &amp; much indebted &amp; forth wt h will ech farthinge pay to her that we haue promised Dalila here's my reward, wc h wt h a thankefull heart I offer Topas And here ys myne, wc h wt h lyke thankes to thee I also render Binzo. And I as gratefully Dalila on thee will this bestow Dalila How to requite your curtesies (princes) I do not know. Larmus yt's not to do, &amp; still we will vnto the rest beholdinge So let's be gone, for I do longe till I see samson grindinge. Binzo. Princes now all our feare ys past syth samson ys in prison where lyke a mill horse he grinds corne wt hout all intermission: Let vs therefore together meete &amp; that in solemne maner that vnto our god Dagon we magnificall hosts may offer who hath into our hands Samson our mortall foe deliuered that dyd our country spoyle, &amp; many of our men destroyed Larmus Your counsell's good: &amp; after that we offered haue to Dagon our sacrifice let's make a sumptuous feast, &amp; out of prison for Samson send, that he may then the foole before vs play to his disgrace, &amp; for to passe the tyme merely away. Topas wt h all my heart I geue consent vnto this your good motion Binzo And I, &amp; so will all the rest: wherefore let's streight be gone Nuncius Since by the philisthijms Samson was committed vnto prison Though they hym hardly vs'd his heirs agayne were somewhat growne as his strength also was, so that when all the princes were in one house at a banquet sett, &amp; had exceedinge cheare. Samson was out of prison fetcht before them for to play, &amp; beinge sett betwene two pillers where on the house did stay he did request the seruant that was for his guide appoynted to let hym to the pillers leane, till he hym self had rested a litle while, wc h he did graunt, &amp; when he had conducted hym there vnto, thinkinge that samson had simplely requested that at his hands, The house beinge full of men, women &amp; children about three Thousand of both sexe, he lookinge toward heauen as well as a blynd man could do, vpon our lord god called sayinge: remember me o lord, &amp; let me be restored to my old strength, that I may be reuenged on myne enemyes at once to recompence them for the losse of my two eyes. And then layinge his hands vpon the pillers, the right on th'one &amp; the lefte on the other sayd of zeale &amp; not of passion: Lord let me wt h the Philisthijms dye, &amp; there wt h shookeye pillers so vehemently that all the house fell downe, &amp; broke in shyuers &amp; all the princes of the Philisthijms kild, wt h the whole company that were wt h in the house litle thinkinge to haue dyed so sodaynly. And dyinge many mo he slew then lyuinge he had slayne (though he of many a man in his lyfe tyme had bene the bane. Yet let no man samson condemne for that he hym self killed in killinge of the Philisthijms for our lord there to concurred as may appeare in that he gaue hym such strength in yt moment, &amp; his owne self to kill directly not [being] his intent, but the philisthijms, though he did know yt wt h them he should dye where in a figure he was of christ, who dyed to kill his enemy. So that we truly may conclude that god his mynd inspyred for to attempt that fact, &amp; hee no way's to be condemned. &amp; twenty yeares he had bene iudge of Israel when he dyed &amp; by his brethren buried was, &amp; so this story's ended.</field>
