      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. This aire shall be perfum'd, and every sence Delighted with sweet smelling frankinsence And aromatick fumes: for please you know, Gentle Spectators, from our Sceane doth grow Abundance of such fragrant stuffe, you'll see A Play that breathes Arabian spicerie, And such a dolefull story as may take Your minds to see a Prince and Princesse fate Presented, and their hard adventures showne, Yea make you weepe, and think they are your own: Our Poet feares none but the common wits, Who think a Sceane's not good unles it fits Their merry humours with some apish toyes, And peevish jeasts fancyed by girles and boyes, Despis'd by abler judgements, who desire A sad and solid matter, such a fire Is kindled for you heere; we feare no blame Shall brand our PhÃ¦nix in her Funerall flame.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus Scena Prima. Amandus, Consolario. Cons. Sir, do not grieve, it is the chance of warre, Cheer up, &amp; triumph in despight of fortune, What fals without the compasse of redresse To sorrow for, argues a feeble spirit, And it doth nothing suit your Princely minde Too much to yeeld to passion. Amand. I confesse, Morall Philosophy doth teach as much, And you have given me precepts, read me lectures Of fickle fortunes mutability, How madly, and without consideration, She doth conferre her favours, yet my sufferings (How great you know my faithfull Consolario) Are of that nature, as but counterpoiz'd In equall ballance with weake humane frailty, They would in spite of my resistance weigh me Down, down unto the ground. Cons. How noble Prince, Your passion hath unrectifi'd your minde, And lead you into errour, did you never Read and believe what Scipio Affricanus Said unto some commanders of his army? That he did shew a greater magnanimity In mastering the affections of his minde, Then in o'rethrowing armies, conquering kingdomes. Apply this noble Roman, to your selfe, Sweet Prince Amandus, what although your state Be desperate now, your Country almost ruin'd, Your army fled, and your chiefe City strait Besieg'd by these Barbarians, if you can Beare with a constant patience what the will Of heaven doth lay on you, no doubt you shall Purchase a greater glory to your selfe By manly suffering what you cannot helpe, Than Geolon the Tartar, though the fates Surrender faire Damascus to his hands. Amand. Why should the partiall fates be so unjust, So cruell to me? had my fortune been Good as my right, the lot of griefe had falne Vpon another soile: and thou my Country, My dearest Country, hadst not felt these wrongs, These miseries of warre thou now sustainest; The carefull husbandman had then enjoy'd His harvest to himselfe, and reap'd the fruits Of his owne labours, had not seene his house Burnt to the very ground, his Vineyards spoil'd, His fields laid waste; the wofull father then With bleeding heart had not beheld his daughter, His fairest daughter ravish'd in his sight, And his chaste wife lye prostituted to The lust of common souldiers, whilst alas He stands spectator of the loathed Scene, Whose death at last shuts up the tragedy: These things had never hapned if my cause, Had been consider'd, nor this stately City (Whose lefty turrets wrap themselves in clouds) Had never been begirt thus round about By forraine foes. Enter a Gentleman with a letter. What newes bring you my friend? Gent. Sir, heavy newes, this letter will inform you Sent from the Governour, which to bring hither In a disguised shape, I pass'd the guards, The trenches and the campe of Geolon, With thousand hazards of my life, all which I reckon not to doe my Noble Prince, My Prince Amandus service. Amand. You are welcome, And we congratulate your safe arrivall; But in what state did poore Damascus stand When you departed thence? how victualled? How furnished with ammunition was it? How long can it hold out? first I will heare Your sad relation ere I breake the seale. Gent. O Sir, I'm sorry my unworthy mouth Should be the organ to convey a sound Vnto your Princely eares, so harsh as this, So dolefull, so unpleasant, I would rather Be silent in a story of such woe; Yet since you doe command me, know my Liege The City is distress'd for want of food: All their provision is consum'd and spent, And nothing left for to sustaine their lives. These two moneths have they fed upon the flesh Of horses, dogs, and cats, now they are driven To such an exigent, as they begin To eate sod leather, yea the excrement Of men and beasts, and which is more, their flesh, Their proper flesh: this day within Damascus, I saw a sight which grieves me to relate, It did appeare so horrid, 'twas a woman With hunger pin'd, who had not eat a bit In seven dayes space of any sustenance, Forc'd with her knife to cut her infants throat That suckt upon her breast, to satisfie With its sweet flesh, her ravenous appetite: And for the ammunition of the towne. As powder, bullets, match, and such materials Of warre, 'tis almost spent, for three yeeres siege Cannot but empty well the magazine; Yet notwithstanding all this misery, (Such as the like I thinke was never heard Or seene in any age) they are resolv'd (So much their loyall hearts affect their Prince) Never to yeeld the towne, so long as any Survives to make resistance, and despise All quarter, all reward that hath been offer'd By Geolon the Tartar. Amand. Consolario, Where are you now with your Philosophy? You'r gone, you'r gone, will you preach patience yet To wretched me your pupill? can you open Your mouth to that effect in such a deluge, In such an inundation of my woes? No, 'tis in vaine, I can receive no comfort: Open ye watry sluces of mine eyes, And let our teares enough to drowne my heart, My heart that's gaul'd for poore Damuscus sake, And my deere friends within: O had the heavens Showr'd cataracts upon me, had their plagues Drunke up my moysture, till my shattered bones Had crumbled into dust, had I excus'd My country with my fall, my peacefull ashes Had fill'd their urne in silence, whereas now Even life is tedious. Consol. Sir, I am your tutor, And I must chide you though you are my Prince, When I perceive you erre as now you doe Through weakenesse of your youth, else I should show No love nor duty, these grey haires of mine, Which time hath turn'd into a silver hue, Know something of the world, and my experience, How ere you slight it, hath seene many changes And alterations wrought in mighty states. I have waded through the various passages Of a long life, and therefore can instruct Your youth in the right way, if you but lend An eare unto my counsels: harke my sonne, I'le tell you plainely, you degenerate In this intemperance of your griefe, From the brave stock of your progenitors, Your royall predecessors; fie for shame, Wrong not your vertue to be desperate, O bury not in the forgetfull grave, Nor drown in this LÃ¦thean floud your glories, Your former glories purchas'd on your foes By your so oft relieving of your country: Rowse up your drowsie spirits, and mitigate Your swelling passions, till I finde a way, A way to cure your sorrowes. Amand. Heaven reward thee For this sweet Balsom thou hast powr'd into My wounded heart, your words have eas'd me of A great part of the burthen which oppress'd me, And I referre me wholly to your wisedome, To perfect what you have so well begun; Now to my letter, here's sad matter sure. Opens and reads the letter. Sir, so miserable is the state and condition of the towne for want of food to sustaine us (as this bearer can more particularly informe you) that unlesse we have speedy reliefe, I feare Damascus will be taken in upon an assault, for our men are so weake through hunger, as they are scarce able to come up and visit the breach, notwithstanding we are resolved rather to dye there, then surrender: so much we preferre your good before our own safety. Amand. Now Consolario, what will you advise me To doe in this extremity of fate? Harke how the Ordnance battereth the walles Of yond faire City, how the Muskettiers Discharge whole volleyes; 'tis some salley sure, Made by the brave besieg'd; how doe I talke, They are too weake, too feeble to attempt it, Poore hunger-sterv'd soules; may it not be A Mine sprung in the rampire of the towne, And an assault made? O I feare 'tis so, My minde presageth ill, mine armes, sa, sa, I'le once againe attempt for to relieve it, Although repulsed last. Consolar. Sir, 'tis in vaine, They are too strong entrench'd for your weake power To make an entrance, had you not experience Too sad, last time by losse of your owne bloud, And slaughter of your men, what folly 'twas For to attempt impossibilities? You may fall on, and loose your selfe and souldiers Vnnecessarily, and to no purpose: But this yon cannot terme true fortitude, But rather rashnesse and temerity; For 'tis a policy in warre, sometimes For to preserve your souldiers, as it is At other times to put them upon service: But 'tis not proper now, stay and attend The sequell of this businesse. Enter a Colonell. Colonell, Can you informe the Prince what did occasion The shooting that we heard now neer the town: Was it a sally, or a triumph made By the Tartarians for their good successe In conquering this Kingdome? Colon. Neither Sir, But an assault alas upon Damascus, A souldier that escap't, told me the manner, And thus it was: After the enemy Had sprung their Mine, which levelled the rampire, And made a breach that eight might march in front: They did assault it with their multitudes, And furiously fell on: thrice the besieg'd, Though hunger-sterv'd, repuls'd them, thrice they were Enforc'd to quit the breach, some had their braines Dash'd out with stones and beames, others with flailes Receiv'd their deaths, and some whose limbs were rent To pieces with granadoes, but at length, Fresh succours from the quarters comming downe, And Hydra-like encreasing, they prevail'd, When all our men were slaine in the defence, Before they entred: onely this poore souldier Escap't whilst they were pillaging the towne, From whom I learnt this sad intelligence. Amand. Now fortune doe thy worst, and if thou canst, Make me more wretched, I'le no longer now Flatter thy malice; since mine eyes have seene The finall period of my Countries fate. Come Consolario, thou and I, and these, Will travell like poore pilgrims through the world, For I am weary of this desolation, And as we passe through this and to'ther Realme, We will inquire their state, that I may finde, If possible, a partner in my griefe. Deere Colonell, dismisse that little Army, That little remnant which the warres hath left me; Bid each man seeke his safety where he can, And tell them if Amandus ere may hope To see a change of fortune, and enjoy Hereafter better dayes, he will then thinke Vpon their faithfull service, and reward them, When all these gusts of sorrow are blowne o're, In ample manner. Now let us obey Our stars, and follow where they point the way. Exeunt. Rapinus, PrÃ¦darius. Rapin, Brother PrÃ¦darius, couldst thou not finde in thy heart to turne Oratour now, and bestow thy best Rhetorick in praise of our most noble profession. PrÃ¦dar. If my education, friend Rapinus were answerable to my desire, I should write whole volumes upon that subject, so much am I taken with it. Rapin. How right you jump upon my humour, for when I doe reflect with judicious eyes upon the poor state and condition of our former life, and weigh it with this glorious change, I magnifie my selfe beyond measure for entertaining such brave sparks of honour and true fortitude in my breast, which hath kindled my affections to these worthy exploits. PrÃ¦da. And now since you bring that into our remembrance, let us consider what poor mechanick rascals we were, under what slavery we lived, how oppressed by hard and usurping Land-lords, and the like? Rapin. All this is true, and much more we suffered, but how are these times altered since? how doe we live now my friend? nothing inferiour in command to the King of Arabia himselfe; are not all these mountaines ours? these caves and forrests ours? these desarts and wildernesses ours? are we not safe in these fortifications from the greatest powers that can possibly invade? we need not now feare the King nor his imposts, he shall now make us amends, and pay tribute of all such goods as passe this way under our jurisdiction. PrÃ¦dar. Tribute say you? it shall be tributus totalis, not a part, but all shall be confiscated to our use: all travellers whatsoever, whether Arabians, Iewes, Turkes, Persians or Egyptians, whose occasions bring them hither either as pilgrims to MÃ¦cha, or as convoyers of rich merchandise ever these desarts, must here be content to doe homage, and unload their commodities to enrich the brave montaneers. Rapinus How commendable therefore is this course of life, how profitable unto us, as when wealth and rich boote is as it were every day offered to our possession, nothing is required from us but a little valour to make us masters of infinite treasures. PrÃ¦dar. And what care we though they brand our foreheads with the names of robbers, theeves, out lawes, rebels, renegados, and such like, whilst we live rich and brave and enjoy our pleasures. Rapin. True, but wee can give our selves when wee list other attributes, taking upon us the glorious name of souldiers, which we worthily merit in exposing our lives, to purchase wealth and honour, to so many hard and dangerous enterprises. PrÃ¦dar. Rightly spoken, for confirmation whereof witnesse so many skarres upon our bodies, so much treasure in our Caves, so many Captives in our chaines, all symboles of our mighty darings. Rapin. But I marvell wee have had no doings to day, will there be no Market thinke yee? no travellers? no carriages? no Camels, no Dromodaries? no boote? it was not wont to be so, how comes this change in the name of Mahomet, what is the clock prethee PrÃ¦darius? PrÃ¦dar. It cannot be lesse then six, for Apollo hath left dallying with AurorÃ¦ more then an houre agoe. Rapin. By Fermagant this is strange, wee were wont to be at our prey assoone as they at their play, how comes it wee heare not from our sentinels wee sent out to discover. PrÃ¦dar. Harke I heare them comming, they should bring good newes by their joyfull acclamations. Enter foure or five of the theeves with shouts and cryes. Rapin. What newes souldiers, are there any travellers stirring this morning, or Caravanes driving over the mountaines? speake quickly, wee are rusty for want of action. 1 Theefe. Noble Captaines as wee sate to discover the plaine, from the top of yonder mountaine, wee might perceive to descend great troopes of people, but the distance of the place suffered us not to discerne whether they were travellers, pilgrimes, or marchants. Rapin. Which way come they, and whether doe they bend their course? 2 It should seeme they come from Alexandria, and are travelling towards Ormus, for they take that way. Rapin. Then they are rich without question; courage my hearts, we shall bee all made by Mahomet; need wee animate them PrÃ¦darius with an Oration? PrÃ¦dar. It will not need, for you see no dulnesse in them to the businesse, too much wherting will take of the edge of their courages. 3 Captaine Rapinus. 4 Captaine PrÃ¦darius. 5 What d'ye meane to delay the time so long in talke, and let this rich boote in the meane time slippe out of our hands. Rapin. Tis well consider'd, and we're glad you are So forward in the action; now my friends Let's fall one bravley, thus I doe dispose you; Some 50. shall lie close in ambuscado Behind the thicket that's within the valley; Discover not your selves before you heare Their Cammels passe beyond you, then breake forth And give a sudden onset; fifty more Shall be obscurd from sight behind the mountaine That lies upon the right hand, and commanded If it stand with the liking of PrÃ¦darius By his discreet conduct; the rest with me Shall guard the passage o're the bridge, and lie Along the christall River, which so gently Glides on the left hand by the mountaines foote. There is no other passage but those three, Which thus block'd up, the prey must needs be ours; Now every man unto his charge; we aime In our attempts at nought so much as gaine. Exeunt. Enter Rapinus and PrÃ¦d. againe with their rabble of theeves, and the boote brought in in bagges. Rapinus Have we not reason my masters, to adore the deity of Fortune, for still favouring our attempts, sure wee are much indebted to that goddesse for her continuall blessings, and we should be very ungratefull if wee did not acknowledge it. PrÃ¦dar. Wee are in a double manner bound to her courtesie. First for this wealth, next for sending such a cowardly guard to convoy it, for had they behaved themselves valiantly, wee had not beene masters of our prey, but return'd home well beaten for our labours. Rapin. But no more of this, I am glad we have it: now we will divide it equally among our selves; your share PrÃ¦darius shall be the Iewels and Plate, the Money, Merchandize and other commodities shall be evenly distributed amongst our men, and for mine owne parr I desire nothing but the faire Lady. PrÃ¦dar. Ha the faire Lady I must not condescend to that, she is my prisoner taken by my owne handes, and therefore belongs to mee as a guerdon of my valour, take you the jewels, and leave me the Lady. Rapin. By Termagant thou art a villaine, and shalt not live an houre for contradicting my will. They both draw. Give up all claime to her, or thy life PrÃ¦darius. PrÃ¦dar. Never, thou shalt write that resignement with thy bloud, and seale it with thy heart. Rapin. Then have at theeâthey fight. 1 Forbeare good Captaine Rapinus. 2 Captaine PrÃ¦darius what doe you meane, will you kill one another for a woman, a pox on her, let her bee common to both, peculiar to neither, enjoy her alike by turnes. 3 She will find you both imployment enough I'le warrant you. 4 She lookes like a free mettall'd beast that will not faint in a double careere. 5 When you have spur'd her sufficiently, and shee begin to grow dull for your service, turne her over to us that we may back her. Rapinus She shall be mine, and who dares lay claime to her besides, forfets his life. PrÃ¦dar. She shall bee only mine maugre the devill himselfe. 1 Asswage your furies (I beseech you) and let mee decide the businesse betweene you, since you both claime her particularly to your selves, and neither will yeeld thereunto, referre your selves to the Ladies owne choice, and bee content to stand to her election. Rapin. I am contentâI know I am the properer manâaside. PrÃ¦dar. I subscribe to't willinglyâshee must needs chuse me for many respects, whose deserts cannot but be discerned by her affectionate eyesâaside. Rapin. Methinkes I am imbracing her dainety body already, whilst thou PrÃ¦darius stand'st as an envious spectator of my happinesse. RrÃ¦dar. Alas poore foole how thou art deceived, thou imbracest Ixion like but a cloud in thy imagination, while the Lady Iuno the true substance is reserved for me; marke thou th'event to thy shame Rapinus. Rapin. I come Lucinda, thy Rapinus comes To court thy beautie, who in spite of fate And all the opposition of the world With this right hand will guard thee, though a troope Of armed Fiends stood up, grant me but Love I'le hold thee then though rivalled by Iove. Exit Rapinus. PrÃ¦dar. But that I know Lucinda ne're will grant When she perceives PrÃ¦darius rivals him Her lovely guardian, I doe see her eyes Dart amourous glaunces on mee, and her hate To him shall be discerned in his fate. Exit PrÃ¦darius. 1 Theefe This is good they are gone and left all the boote behind, but twill not be amisse to discover if the coast bee cleere or no. Ha, ha, ha, they are gone sheere away by this light, was it not sport camrades to see them fight one with another, what fooles were they to fall out in that manner and leave this unregarded? 2 Let them still disagree so, wee fare the better for't, if this occasion had not happened we had finger'd but a little share of this wealth, I can tell yee. 3 This bagge is mine. 4 And this is mine. 1 But where is my part then? 2 And mine, by Mahomet we will not be thus used. 1 This is good y'faith, whilst wee are talking you are taking, my masters you are best let us share with you, give me this bagge Sirrah. 2 And me this, or by. 5 Tis in vaine to strive, you shall get nothing that way but blowes, doe you not know that possession is a maine point of the Law. 1 Cheate us and jeere too, Rogues our partes are your heartâthey fall together by the eares. Rapinus, PrÃ¦darius. PrÃ¦dar. How now what's the matter here, fighting about the prey, we'll have you all hang'd for this you slaves. 1 Thief. Good Sirs bee patient, and by your good savours, let me tell you we did but follow your example, and we know tis a chiefe maxime in warre that Souldiers are bound to follow their Leaders. 2 Besides Sirs our quarrell beares a better colour with it then yours, being for gold and jewels, your's but for a prettie Wench, pardon our sawcy talkings. Rapin. Well for this time wee pardon you, yet because you shall learne next how to behave your selves better, and to make use of a booty when tis offered unto you, wee will ease you of this burthen, come your bags, Sir your bags. PrÃ¦dar. And yours Sir, dispatch we must have them all Henceforth my friends agree, and differ not In the division of your boot, nor give The world occasion to traduce our fame By confirmation of this proverb old, When theeves fall out, true men come by their gold. Exeunt. Finis Actus primi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus Scena Prima. Perseus, Embassadour of Ãgypt. Perseus VVhat should I think my Lord of this delay, That holds so long the Princesse of my life, My faire Lucinda from me, doe not you Measure the time, and wonder what should be Th' occasion of her stay? me thinks 'tis strange! Embas. I wonder not at all Prince Perseus, Nor scarce expect her yet, for but consider The distance of those kingdomes, and the tract Of ground 'twixt Egypt and the Persian Realme, And you must then conclude that this is not A worke of three dayes journey. Pers. Then my hopes And languishing desires to see my love Erre in the computation of the time, Fancying three dayes three yeeres, but by your leave, Was't not reported in this Court of Persia More then a moreth agone that she was ready With her EgiptiÃ¦n traine to take her journey? Emb. 'Tis true 'twas so reported, yet it might Be a false rumour, grant the contrary That truth and it concurr'd, yet many thinges Happen you know between the cup and the lip. The Princesse then might have been indispos'd To health and sick and so unapt to travell. Or else he royall Father and my king (Which heavens defend) might be affected with His old disease, and she loath to depart Before he had recovered better state; Innumerable other thinges might happen Which now I cannot thinke of, but suppose She had at home no let or interuption, Yet must they passe the red sea, or be forc'd To come about by Istmus overland, Then travell through the desarts of Arabia, Which is a tedious way and not so soone To be o'recame as you suppose it is. Perseus. It may be so, my Lord Embassadour, These are the reasons or such like as these, But my Propheticall my Delphick minde Prompts me alas unto another cause More probable, I feare that glorious Orbe Where my faire starre moves in (I meane your land,) Made glorious by her lustre, and envied By all the neighbouring kingdomes round about, Should now grow proud, &amp; scorn her beams should grace, Besides their owne, another Hemisphere, What thinke you Sir of this? Embas. It cannot be Your princely minde should harbour such conceit, To thinke our land so dull, as not to see The greatnesse of this empire, and the honour Egypt receives to match with Persia; But I interpret otherwise your speech Applying it unto the power of love, Whose force is such as it will draw a man Into Poetick raptures. Perse. I approve Your iudgment in the art, when I but name Lucinda, that bare sound strikes heavenly musick Into my soule, and makes my thoughts harmonious, Each sillable therein is a strong charme To hould me in the labyrinth of love; Fairest Lucinda why dost thou with-hould The day so long, and suffer Perseus To live in night wanting thy wished presence, Till thou appeare I can behould no sunne No beame of comfort, that bright wagoner, Who doth begin his progresse in the East And ends it in the West, each day surrounding The compasse of this lower world, infuses No light into my sences, for he stayes To borrow some of thee; bright starre appeare. Embass. Now Sir I see love hath divinely wrought Vpon your inward faculties, that could Beget so high a straine as you have us'd In admiration of the lowd obeict; But love they say is nurse of poetry. Pers. I thinke no lesse for for ere I was in love Before Lucindas beauty kindled had A sacred fire in my enflamed brest, I knew not what it was to poetize, But now I'le cloath my lines in sable weedes, And vent my thoughts in an Elegiack name, I'le sing sad songes untill my mistresse comes For to inspire me better; O I cannot Beare with her absence, what thinke you my Lord Is she upon her journey? that I may My selfe in person with some rroopes of horse Ride forth to meete her on the way as farre As the wild deserts of Arabia stretch To safe conduct her hither. Embass. Noble Prince I doe believe she wants no strong convoy To guard her ore the mountaines, and more strength Added, I thinke would be superfluous, For sure the King knowing the passage well How dangerous, how long and troublesome Would ne're consent she should goe weakly guarded, But you may doe your pleasure. Enter a Messenger in haste. Pers. Freind, what newes Bringst thou unto the Court? what speakes thy face Commixt with dust and sweat? Messeng. Redouted Prince, It speakes in characters a story which Will make you sad to heare, and me to speake, Which thus I reade unto you, our faire Princesse, The beautifull Lucinda travelling through The Country of Arabia, for to meet Her happinesse in Persia with a guard Of some few horse and foot, was set upon By souldiers, what they were I doe not know, Their number was ten times as much as ours, Yet we so long resisted as we could, Vntill the most part of our men were slaine, Then some were forc'd to save their lives by flights Some three or four, no more of which small number I write my selfe, who tooke my journey hither Alone to give you notice what befell us; Let not my newes great Prince, exclude my welcome. Embas. But what befell the Princesse all this while, Her Ladies and attendance? Messen. Taken prisoners By two that seemed to command the rest With all their plate and jewels. Embas. Know you not In what part of that fatall soile befell This sad disaster, or by whom 'twas done? Was't in Arabia fÃ¦lix, or desart, Or Petrea else? Messen. 'Faith Sir I was never There in my life before, nor did I then Enquire the true denomination of it, And therefore cannot satisfie you in The thing you doe demand, Embas. But you can tell me The nature of the place and Country, then I'le satisfie my selfe: was't sweet and lovely, Perfum'd with spices and rich Frankincense, Or was't a rocky soile, and mountainous, Wilde, unfrequented, full of caves and dennes, Of wood and desert, you can tell me this? Messen. I'm sure it was not spicy, for it had A bitter smacke, we prov'd it to our cost, Some never could digest it: Frankincense There was not any, I should smell it then: Mountaines I saw, and unfrequented pathes, Resembling well a desart: this is all I can informe you of by circumstance. Perseus. How's this? am I awake, or in a dreame? Dead, or alive? what Apoplex was that Ty'd all this while my tongue from breaking forth Into wilde exclamations? O my heart! My better part, Lucinda prisoner! Heavens what a sound is that, no death so fatall, So dolefull to my thoughts, Lucinda tane By theeves and out-lawes, worse, and Perseus Vncertaine where she is, still worse and worse. What shall I doe, dye? that were to no purpose, And leave her unredeemed: no, I'le first Raise a great Army, and lay waste that soyle, That fatall soyle which first procur'd my woe: I'le cut off this distinction of three names, Arabia fÃ¦lix, PetrÃ¦a, and Deserta, And bring them into one, and that's the later: Cosmographers shall ne're divide the land Into three parts, Arithmeticians neither Shall worke it as a fraction, but entire, An entire number, term'd by all deserta: The PhÃ¦nix shall no longer harbour there, Or if she doe, we will destroy the Spices Wherewith she alwaies built her funerall pile To burne her selfe to ashes, and thereby Hinder a second birth: what will we not Doe to revenge this wrong? the worst of ils That can be thought of is not bad enough For to afflict that Country which detaines My faire Lucinda from me: I haue not The patience to dispatch an Embassage And to expect reply: I'le goe my selfe And by my armies march, my cannons mouth, My trumpets warlike sound, my beating drum, The King shall know the businesse why I come. Exeunt. Amandus, Consolario, Colonell, Gentleman. Amand. Then you dismiss'd the army. Colon. As I was Commanded by your Highnesse, so I did. Amand. But did you tell my loving friends &amp; souldiers, That in this gratefull heart of poore Amandus, Was treasur'd up their love and faithfull service, Never to be forgotten. Colon. Sir, J was not Wanting in the least part of my commission. Amand. How did they take my leaving them, and this my separation. Colon. At the first unkindely, Because you would not take them as a guard To safe conduct your person, yet when I Enforc'd your love by binding arguments, They did submit unto your will, and stood No longer to dispute it. Amand. Yet their hearts Were griev'd I make no question, for their losse And desperate fortunes. Colon. Not so much my Lord For their owne fortunes, as for yours appear'd they Troubled in minde, for when I drew them all Into a Ring, and told your minde unto them, From every common souldiers eye, gusht forth Rivers of teares, and after from their hearts, Brake forth these exclamations: O my Prince, My deerest Prince, why should the partiall heavens Deale so unjustly with thee, or their malice Injure thy goodnesse? why wilt thou depart So weakely guarded, and expose thy selfe Yet longer naked to the stroke of fortune? Why should we be excluded from thy presence? Yet since it is his pleasure, wee'l no longer Dispute the reasons why, but yeeld unto it: Heavens prove propitious, let his smiling stars Shed pleasing influences o're his head, And guide his journey, let the froward fates See and repent the wrong they did unto him, And recompence his losse with interest For all his sufferings: O what cause have we To grieve for him, for ne're in any age, Have subjects boasted of a sweeter Prince. Amand. This makes me melt againe, and to deplore Their miserable state and sad condition That were so touch'd with mine; but Consolario, What desart soile is this, that so well suits My desart minde? what solitary land That mockes my farre more solitary heart? What ayre doe we now breath in? Consol. Sir, this Country Is term'd the desarts of Arabia Where we now travell in. Amand. Not that same Country, So famous for the PhÃ¦nix and her nest, And for that second PhÃ¦nix, rare PhÃ¦nicia, (Farre more to be admired then the first) Th' Arabian Kings faire daughter. Consolar. No my Lord, That's call'd Arabia fÃ¦lix, this deserta, So infamous through thefts and robberies Committed on all travellers by the theeves And out-lawes of the Country, who frequent These Caves and Mountaines, this and th'other part Make but one kingdome, 'twas not my advice You came this way, you know I told you of The danger by the robbers. Amand. Prethee tell me What should they rob from me that I should shun them? What have I left that I should feare a theefe? A jewell, two or three, poor paultry toyes To loose, when I before have lost a kingdome: You'l say they'l take my life, alas they will not Be so compassionate to ease me of A burthen so despised, under which I faint, and panting breath this ayre of woe. Consol. Nay good my Lord, no more of this discourse, You promis'd once a manly resolution To tugge with fortune, will you fall againe Into relapse of griefe, and said remembrance? How poore this shewes in you! Amand. Well, I'le forget it, And finde some other talke: you told me now This was a part of faire Arabia, Termed deserta, and another part Hight FÃ¦lix, there's another yet besides, Or else the history is false that writes it, How name you that? Consol. That Sir is PetrÃ¦a, So call'd of Petra, the chiefe City in't, Or else because 'tis rocky. Amand. Which of these Arabia fÃ¦lix, PetrÃ¦a, or deserta Is that sweet soyle so much commended for Her gummes and spices, odours, and perfumes? I'm sure it is not this. Consol. No, that is FÃ¦lix, And rightly beares it that denomination; For 'tis a happy Country, no delight But flowes abundant there, embroydered fields, Faire meadowes, pleasant groves, cleare cristall brooks, Sweet lovely Cities, gardens diapred All o're with Flora's richest tapestry, Are seene there all the yeere, continuall spring Dwels in that coast, white hoary bearded Hyems, Ne're shakes his snowy tresses, nor his frost Nips the faire flowers that beautifie her breast, Nor boysterous Boreas with his winter blasts, Shakes her faire fruit, but delicate Favonius Creeps gently o're her fields with flowry breath Creating gummes and spices; sure it is The garden of the world, the PhÃ¦nix else Had never chose that place above all other To recreate her selfe in: your Damascus Is but a desart if compar'd unto it. Amand. But good old man, have you forgotten that, Before the Tartar did invade my land, We had laid downe our travell there to see The much admir'd PhÃ¦nicia, when the sight Of this faire picture did captive my heart: What motion doe I feele againe within me, To blow the fire rak'd in forgetfull ashes, And halfe dead in Damascus? Enter PrÃ¦darius with 5 theeves. PrÃ¦dar. Stand, and give up your purses, or your lives, We require one or both. Amand. Do'st thou not see us Stand with our swords drawn, mine I thus give up into thy body,âkils PrÃ¦darius. 3 thiefe What shall we doe? our Capt kil'd, let's flye. Gent. As thou hast liv'd with him, so shalt thou dy And serve him in the other world kils the third thiefe. 4 thiefe. But I Serv'd him for feare, not love, and should be loath To wait on him to hell on such a journey. Colou. Villaine forsake thy master, that thou shalt not my sword shall keepe thee in thy true obedience, Killes him, the other three escape to Rapinus. Consolar. Blessed deliverance! we have cause to thanke The heavenly powers of this our victory, And preservation. Gentle. With what confidence Of good successe their Captaine gave the onset? But when the Princes conquering sword dispatch'd him How soone his theeves were quel'd. Consolar. Sweet Prince I feare More stormes for in this clouded Wildernesse They are most frequent, and I doubt the worst Is not blowne o're, let's therefore hast our journey To shelter us in safety. Amand. I'le not be Averse unto good counsell though I value This life at a lowe rate; now let's direct Our steppes towards that happy soile you spake off, That I may see though now with humbled eyes PhÃ¦nitia faire, the minion of the skies.âExeunt. Enter Rapinus wounded, with all his rabble of theeves leading in betweene them Amandus, the Collonell and gentleman also wounded, Consolario following after weeping, then enter Lucinda. Rapinus See faire Lucinda mine, what triumphs we Bring to adorne thy conquests, see what captives Are ready here to waite upon thy triumph, See what a purple flood hath issued forth From these two gaping wounds which I receiv'd To bring these pretious jewels to Lucinda, And yet she kils Rapinus with disdaine, Did ere your eyes see fairer? Lucinda Never true lie, And I beleeve this Kingdom yeelds none such, They speake the owner some great personage, From whom did you extort them? Rapin. From that captive Who kill'd PrÃ¦darius and thus wounded me, And made such havocke of our men, he now Shall lie in durance for't. Lucinda Heavens what a wonder, What an Angellike object strikes mine eyes, In masculine appearance!âaside. Were you Noble These jewels were a ransome to redeeme him, And set his friends and him at liberty At least to barre hard usage. Rapin. If it be Your pleasure to command their free enlargement, I seale unto it, for faire Lady know You carry such divinity about you As it converted hath and almost alter'd (I speake it to my shame) my former nature, But had I still continued as my selfe, I had not begg'd this favour, which you know I might command at pleasure. Lucinda You are angry And all this while mistake me, I as little Desire their liberty as you your selfe, But I would have them us'd in gentler manner Then other prisoners for these jewels sake, Which take me more then all the wealth you ere Presented me withall. Rapin. This cheeres me yet That now at length, one of my offerings are Accepted by my goddesse; captives kneele And reverence her deity whose breath Hath free'd you from a servitude more darke Then hell it selfe; now this must bee your prison This Cave of mine, till we determine further. Lucind. Would I might be his jaylour and his surgeon, Alas, his wounds bleedâaside Sir you'll loose your prisoners Vnlesse some care be taken for their wounds, Their death can doe no service, first I'le dresse Your hurts, and then for pities sake apply A plaister unto theirs. Rapin. Do what you will. Lucinda Your wounds art deepe Sirâdresses him. Rapin. I beleeve they are, And you have one faire Lady too wants tenting, I hope one day to search it and returne Your courtesie againe in a kind nature.âaside Lucind. This salve will cure it. Rapin. I beleeve no lesse, There is great vertue in 't deriv'd from you. Lucind. Come let me dresse you Sir. Amand. Me gentle Lady, No let me bleed to death, like Seneca Go sleeping to my grave, your paines were ill Bestow'd on one that's weary of his life, Shew your compassion one my friends, and then You shall oblige my ashes in their urne To blesse your bounty. Lucind. I'le not be deny'd, Your friends I care for tooâsure LÃ¦das swannes Were black compar'd to this more whiter skinne, No silke so softâaside Now I have done with you. As I have beene your Surgeon be mine too, Would he did know my woundâall aside. Amand. To speake my thankes Would come to short by farre of what I thinke; I'm sorry Madam your so pretious salve Should wasted be on such a wretch as I, It better were reserv'd for nobler uses. Lucind. Now Sir you must receive too from my hand, This plaister and your cure. Colon. I kisse those hands That daigne me such a favourâdresses him. Lucinda. You must feele The vertue of my salve too. Gentle. As we have The bounty of your noble disposition, For both our humble thankesâdresses him. Rapin. Come have you done, You dwell too long there and neglect a cure Worth all the rest, Rapinus heart is sick, And craves a plaister, wounded by your love, A patient in your care to be preferr'd Before a thousand captives. Lucinda. May be so, But yet repent not charitable workes Vpon the poore distress'd, if gentle nature Move not your heart to this, yet let the thought That they may doe good service in your warres, (Since you your selfe have seene the valour tri'd) Worke that effect upon you. Rapin. You plead strongly, And I cannot repugne your argument; But are all Ladies so compassionate And pittifull as you? I thinke they are not. Lucinda. They are indeed, our sex hates cruelty. Rapin. Then you should hate cruelty in love. Lucinda. That's in another nature. Rapin. Come sit downe, How long have you professed surgery? I never saw you practise it before. Lucinda. I learnt it from a child. Rapin. Tis a fine art And well it doth become a Ladies hand Gentlie to touch a wound, but I forgate To aske my prisoners what and when they were, And to what place they travell'd, pray demand. Lucind. I will Sirâthis suites well with my desireâaside Faire Sir may I request to know your state, Your name and countrey, whence you come and where Your journey lay when this captivity Befell you on your travell? Amand. Courteous Lady, You first demand my state, I can resolve you In these words; 'tis poore and miserable, Made so by fortunes malice, and my starres. My name I humbly crave I may conceale, My Country is Damascus, and therein As in a booke you may reade out my story; Have you not heard the fall of that brave City? Lucinda Yes, and the fame of that more braver Prince Admir'd Amandus, I beleeve you have Some neere relation to him. Amand. Yes, in fortune I have indeed, for I suppose our sufferings Are much alike. Lucinda So are your names and natures; I make no question, if they were reveal'd, But I have found enough. aside. Rapinus He will not tell His name it seemes Lucind. That matters not at all, I gather by his words he is some Knight Of sad Damascus, or some kinsman of Th'unfortunate Amandus. Rapinus Very likely, But we spend too much time in this discourse. What doe I meane? I have not yet given order To put out sentinells upon the hilles For to discover boote; come will you walke And take the aire a little? prisoners come You shall receive a dram too and no more But to prepare your stomackes 'gainst the time, I'le weane you from it. Amand. Weane me from my breath Of life, and then I'le thanke thee in my death. Exeunt Enter the three theeves 1 theefe This is worse and worse by the Almanack. 2 theefe Alkeron, foole thou wouldst say, we doe not use to sweare in that phrase. 3 theefe Besides, there is no sence in Almanacke. 1 theefe I say there is good sence and meaning in't, if you had the wit to conceive it. 2 theefe As how prethee? 1 theefe As thus, grossum caput, 'tis worse and worse by the Almanacke, that's as much to say, 'tis worse with us this yeere then 'twas the yeere before. 3 theefe 'Faith thou sayest true, thou hast opened and applyed the point too very handsomely, I commend thy wit for't. 1 theefe Besides, did I not shift an oath too very prettily? observe my religion in't as well as my wit. 2 theefe I thought thou hadst sworne. 3 theefe And so did I by the Alkeron. 1 theefe But to our first discourse before you interrupted me: is't not worse and worse with us every day than other? we were wont to have some feeling of the gaine, as well as of the paine, and to share with our Captaines, now we must be contented to stand to his courtesie, divell share him for it. 2 theefe We lost our best Captaine when we lost PrÃ¦darius, would Rapinus had excus'd him, we should had better dayes then. 3 theefe What fooles were we to save his life, when hee lay at the mercy of the stranger, I repent it now most heartily, 2 theefe And so doe I, but had we knowne he would reward us so, and give us nothing for our labours, he should have gone to hell for me, I would never have staid him. 3 theefe And the more to torment his Ghost, we would have made his foe and conquerour Captaine in his place. 1 theefe If he continue thus dogged, we may doe it yet by some tricke or other, let him not too much provoke us. 2 theefe All his minde is upon the wench by Mahomet, all is given unto her, nothing unto us but a bastinado now and then, shall we endur't? 3 theefe And yet for all so much treasure as he gives her, of my conscience she gives him nothing in returne thereof, no not so much as her maydenhead. 1 theefe Her maydenhead, 'twas a question if she had that to give him. 3 theefe Then not a vaulting turne, not one single career, not a foot in the stirrop, or terme it what you will. 2 theefe Nay, I believe scarse a drie kisse unlesse by force. 1 theefe Then he is a pretious coxcombe, if I were he, I trow she should give me a dry and a wet kisse too by her leave. 3 theefe I am clean out of charity with him in good faith. 2 theefe And so are we all for his hard dealinges. 1 theefe But we must smother our discontent aswell as we can. 2 theefe What shall we doe now? 3 theefe To our old trade, to watch for others Profit. 2 theefe Come let's away then, we shall be found tardie else, and perchance tould so much by a dumbe instrument called the cudgell. 1 theefe Indeed he speakes often to us in that language. But come camrades the times may alter'd be, When we shall speake that speech so well as he, And make him understand us when we call, As he doth make us now, this may befall. Exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius Scena Prima. The King of Arabia, Alecto. King In midst of stormes, and these tumultuous times Of warre and bloud, in midst of troubled seas Of forraigne states, how safely doe we saile And steere our course, Alecto, in a calme: No dusky cloud lowres on our ship of state, No windes of adverse fortune shake our peace, But smile and gently breathe a quiet gale: Blest starres that raign'd at our nativity, Kinde Planet, under whose sweet influence We were brought forth, deere fortune that confer'd This happinesse upon th' Arabian King. Alecto It cannot be deny'd Sir, but you are As much indebted to the gods for favours, As any mortall Prince, and in some things Enjoy prerogatives above them all, As in the wealth and beauty of your land: Your subjects love, your peace with forraigne Kings That are your neighbours. Lastly, in this point, Which makes you more admir'd then all the rest, In having such a daughter, who for vertue And beauty both cannot be paralel'd By any other Princesse, and I thinke Hath not her equall in the world besides. King She is my chiefest joy I must confesse, And the sole staffe of my declining age. I under value farre my Crowne beneath her, My gold, my jewels, yea although I were Possess'd of the worlds vast treasury, It were but drosse unto my darling deere, My deare PhÃ¦nicia, all my care and study Is how to see her marryed as becomes The daughter of a King, and the great dower Dame nature and her fortune both will leave her. Alecto This likes me not, I'le thwart it what I can, For to advance my love and proper fortunes.âaside. But royall Sir, have you proposed yet A match unto the Princesse? King Yes, and have Shew'd her the portraitures of divers Princes, Of Persia, of Tartaria, of Austria, Of Egypt, Babylonia, and the rest, To make her choice, but yet she likes not any. Alecto That's good, she likes a substance, not a shadow: This makes for me. âaside. What doth she then object An't please your royall Majesty? King That she's Not yet dispos'd to marriage, pleading youth And ignorance in what doth sute a Bride. Alect. That's nothing, she'l be soone instructed by Her husband in that duty. King Yet I will not Force her affection; she desires to have Two yeeres yet added to her age, before She would determine marriage; but you left The clause imperfect, when you did digresse From what we first discours'd, and fell upon The praises of my daughter, now no more Of this, but enter on the first againe; What was it nephew? Alecto Sir, I was applauding Your happy state and fortune, and what cause You had to thanke the gods for benefits You did enjoy above all other Princes, Yet to the end you might not thinke your selfe In earthly pleasures absolutely happy, And so grow proud, there lyes a barre between you And the full consummation of your blisse. King A barre, what is't? it shall be then remov'd, And the way cleer'd. Alecto There's difficulty in't: I meane the theeves and out lawes of your Country, Who make your land unfree, and hold by force The third part of Arabia, call'd deserta, Who rob your selfe and subjects of their goods, Vsurping priviledges, and exacting Tributes and dues of every passenger, Stranger or otherwise that travell that way. King This takes away much from my true content, (I must confesse) and troubles me the more, Because I know not which way to redresse it. You know we have left no way unattempted, To drive them thence, yet fail'd in our desire, Because of their retrait into the mountaines, Which for our army is inaccessible. Many complaints are preferr'd unto us, Not onely by our subjects, but by others Against these rebels for their goods extorted, Who doe demand from us all restitution, As if those theeves were under our command: Yea, many Kings our neighbours have dispatcht Embassadours about it to our Courts Whose Caravans and treasures have been rob'd, Passing the desarts by these mountaineers, Demanding for their losse, full satisfaction, Who have departed hence much discontented: This in the end I doubt will raise a warre Between us, and disturbe our setled peace. Enter a Lord attendant. What newes with you? Lord Sir, there's a Gentleman Lately return'd from travell, now arriv'd Vnto the Court, who humbly craues to have Accesse about affaires of great import, Which doe concerne your royal Majesty. King. Admit him straight, we'll heare the businesse. Enter the Gentleman. We understand you're late return'd from travell, From what parts came you now? Gent. From Persia Sir. King. What have you to deliver? Gent. That the Persian Is marching hither with a mighty army To fall upon your Kingdome, from the Court I did accompany the Campe, untill I learnt the certainty of their designe, Then in the night I left them, and with speed Rode poast to warne you, that you might provide Against a strong invasion. King. But where did you Part from the Persian Army? Gentle. In the confines Of Babylonia nere faire Euphrates. King. How strong are they? Gentle. Their Army doth amount Vnto a hundred thousand foote, their horse Equals that number bravely equipag'd And furnish'd for the warre. King. Who doth command As Generall? Gentle. Prince Perseus himselfe. Alecto Could you not understand upon what grounds They built their discontent and rash proceeding? Gent. I can in forme you nothing of the cause, But so much of th'effect, I can assure you, Is it too too true. King. This makes me not a little To wonder at the strangenesse of the thing; Who ever heard of any Prince that was Invaded by his foe, before he knew What his pretence was, and the cause that mov'd him To enter into warre; I cannot guesse The reason why the Persian should receive Distast, and therefore am incredulous Almost of your report. Gentle. Sir I could wish, (So much I doe preferre my King and Countrey Before my life) I might be prov'd a lyar, Although I suffer'd for it, rather then Behold the devastation of a soile So sweet as faire Arabia; but alas Your royall selfe, and we your loyall subjects I feare too soone will have experience of The truth of my relation, and perchance Repent too late your incredulity, Grounded upon too much security. What should it ought advantage me to lie? King. Vrge it no more, we do beleeve what you Have told us is a truth, and will provide Against the enemies approaching force; Sure tis some wronges hath caus'd this by the theeves, And the mad hare brain'd Prince hath not the patience (It seemes) for to acquainte me but by warre, And violent eruption into Armes; It must be so, else can I not imagine The least occasion why, well we will stand Vpon our strongest guard to keepe our land. Exeunt. Rapinus, Lucinda. Rapin. In troth sweet Lady you are much to blame Thus to deferre my pleasures, and delude My longing hopes with trifling vaine delaies, I suffer most extremely. Lucinda. I could laugh To heare you talke thus; are you so impatient, You that are borne to such a course of life, (And so low fortune) as you cannot stay A moneth or two to waite the love and pleasure Of a Kings daughter, for the which great Princes Have su'd, and serv'd a yeare for. Rapin. Are you then Of the blood royall, well we'll mix our bloods Together, so shall mine be royall too; But wherefore did you tell me that you were But an Ãgyptian Lady? Lucinda. And in that I did not lie, scarce use equivocation For Madam is a title that's apply'd To Queenes sometimes as unto common Ladies. Rapin. Why did you keepe me in this ignorance So long, and now at last reveale your selfe? Lucinda. To awe your boldnesse when I saw it grow To such a height as now; Sir keepe your distance. Rapin. High words indeed seeming to have a kind Of reference to Majestie; but tell me What King begat you? Lucinda. Not to satisfie Thy proud demand, but make thee know thy selfe And the base wrong thou dost me, do I answer Vnto thy question: understand I am The mighty Souldans daughter and his heire Sent by my Father to be married to The Prince of Persia, when thy barbarous troope And lawlesse selfe enforc'd a Rape upon me, For which thou shalt repent, unlesse thou doe Make speedy restitution of my selfe Vnspotted in my honour. Rapin. Not such haste To part, faire Princesse, in a fit of choler; You know not yet my humour, nor I yours, We must participate each others nature Before we can resolve in coulder bloud. Lucind. Vncivill groome dost thou thinke to enjoy me? I'le rather prostitute my body to The lust of a deformed Incubus, Or ugly Satire, then retaine one thought Of thy lewd loath'd embraces. Rapin. That's because You're told they're active in the art of vaulting, But you shall find me Madame so dexterious, As not inferiour to them in that kind; Try my performance. Lucinda. Thou lascivious man Thou bestiall Goate, how darst thou tainte chast eares With thy infectious breath? know tis in vaine Further to urge thy lust, for I'm resolv'd To runne the hazard of a thousand deaths Rather then to yeeld unto it. Rapin. Foolish woman Thy rage or'e comes thy wit, think'st thou this way To worke upon me? dost thou not perceive Thou art my prisoner, and what now thou hast Is all my gift, thy life, thy reputation, Thy wealth and jewels? dost not see when I Please to command thee to give up those things Thou hast not power to hold them scare a minute? And yet art thou so inconfiderate? Dreame not, nor feed this foolish fantasie Within your minde to thinke yeur Father can Rescue you hence, or your betroathed Lord The Persian Prince redeeme you from my cave, Although they came with greater forces far Then Xerxes or Darius; I am safer Here in this unfrequented wildernesse, Thus barracadoed round with hils and mountaines, Then they in all their strong fortifications, Their Forts and Castles. Lucind. I perceive my errour, And therefore must a little temporize To prevent outrage.âaside. Sir, you mov'd your lust, But not your love, and woo'd me in a phrase That fitter were to be apply'd unto A common whore or strumpet, then a Lady, Much lesse a Princesse, this I must confesse Enflam'd my anger, and enforc'd me to Forget my selfe a little. Rapin. I confesse My errour too, and crave your pardon Lady, See how one gentle word hath mollifid My disposition, and cleane turn'd the streame Of my full bent desire to be possess'd By force of what I now resolved am To crave by faire intreaty in the way Of honest marriage. Lucinda Now your stile is good, And tasteth something of civility, Yet I desire some respite to give answer Vnto your sute for two considerations: First, that I may have time to make my prayers Vnto the shrine of holy Mahomet, To grant a dispensation of my vow Made to the Persian Prince, to be his wife: Next that I be not perjur'd to my selfe, To loose my Virgin girdle, ere my age Hath numbred twenty springs to reinvest Our naked mother earth in robes of greene. Rapin. Why did you make, pray, such a foolish vow To stay a Maid so long? Lucind. I did indeed. Rapin. What wants now of the time? Lucind. But a bare moneth, That is not long you know. Rapin. Well, I'm content, Though my desires are apt to climbe the tree Iust at this very instant, and to taste Your dainty maiden fruit, but love is sweeter If freely granted, then if tane by force, Therefore I'le stay the time prefixt, and not Beyond the same a minute, see you doe not Longer abuse my patience, if you doe, What love cannot, force shall constraine you to: Come, will you goe?âExit Rapinus. Lucind. I must stay here a little. I'le wait on you soon; heavens in what narrow straights Wretched Lucinda have thy fates confin'd thee? In what amazed labyrinth of love Am I enclos'd, and cannot find a clue To guide me forth, no light, no salliport? I love my fellow prisoner, but I hate The theefe Rapinus, how I shall enjoy The one, and handsomely avoyd the other. A womans wit alas cannot contrive: How soone I have forgot the Persian Prince? How soone my selfe? my eye but glanced on The beauty of this stranger, but his looke, His high commanding looke, which darted forth Majesticke sparkes, captiv'd my yeelding heart: He is though shadowed, that farre fam'd Amandus, Damascus Prince, I reade the characters Of majesty deepe stamped in his brow; I'le vent my thoughts unto him, and this cave Shall helpe me to his love, or to my grave. Enter Sara her Mayd. Sara, what wilt thou counsell me to doe in the thing you wot of? Sara I have told you my opinion already. Lucinda But can a woman with any modesty make love to a man? Sara Puh, why not in a case of extremity, when the woman is hot, and the man is cold in the businesse? Lucind. But if I should commit through extreme passion such a folly, should I not be wondred at, and hated amongst women for giving an ill example to the world? Sara Nothing lesse, but on the contrary, be assur'd you shall reape from them infinite love and thankes for laying them down such a president of boldnesse, but if you dispute pro &amp; con, thus, and make such objections, you shall never obtaine your desires while you live, I will warrant you. Lucinda But dost thou thinke there is any hope of speeding in my suit, upon notice given him of my love. Sara No question, Madame, he cannot but most willingly embrace it, and blesse his fortune for so high a favour. Lucind. Aye me Sara, I feare I am not so happy, my stars foretell not so prosperous an Omen: though I have by signs and dumb shewes, by sighes and amorous glances told him my affection, yet seems he not to understand that language, but as insensible of my paine, suffers mee to languish in my torment. Sara I would faine aske your Ladiship one question, if I might be so bold, and thereby not incurre your displeasure. Lucind. Speake thy minde freely, thou shalt give me no offence at all. Sara Taking your word for my warrant then, I desire to know if you be in earnest or in jest, for I cannot beleeve you should so soone forget the great Prince of Persia, and doat so extremely on this stranger, whose ranke and quality you know not, but by conjecture. Lucind. Such is the commanding power of love thou seest, which is able to doe more impossible matters then these; I meane sincerely; Neither have I reason to repent the chance. Sara No, suppose he be that poore exiled Prince of Damascus, is he to be compared, or in your good opinion to be preferred before the puissant Persian, one of the greatest Monarchs of the world? Lucind. How foolishly thou talkest, dost thou not know that comparisons are odious, especially in love matters? counsell me better what to doe, or keep thy thoughts in thine owne bosome. Sara Madame, my help and furtherance shall not be wanting in any thing wherein I can doe you service: let your wit contrive the way according to your desire, and let me alone to put it in execution. Lucind. Then what if I sent thee to him with a letter stuff'd full of affection, would not that be a pretty way to cover my blushes, and yet discover my love? sure it would, what thinkest thou Sara? Sara I cannot but approve your plot exceedingly Madame, for if there be then any fault escaped, or any small breach of maiden modesty made, it shall be imputed to the inke and paper, which is of too pale a colour to blush. Lucind. It shall be so then, get me pen, inke, and paper presently, but soft, he comes to save me that labour, I am arm'd with boldnesse for the encounter, assist me, Cupid, I beseech thee. Amandus, Consolario, Colonell, Gentleman. Amand. Faire Princesse, here behold before your eyes, Those whom your courtesie hath made your slaves: I meane my friends and me, whose thanks, yea lives We come to tender to you, but alas, The debt we owe is greater, and the summe Not to be answer'd so, yet we beseech you Take this in part of payment, which we offer With zealous hearts, and no lesse strong devotion, And though we cannot cancell your great bill, Impute that to our want, not to our will. Lucind. Most courteous Sir, if through my means you have Enjoy'd the benefit of any thing, I thanke my fates that made me an instrument Of doing so much good: you shall oblige me To tell me, since I cannot tell my selfe What thing Lucinda did, that could produce So strong an obligation. Amand. You impose Too great a taske upon me, for weake words Cannot expresse it full; Madame, we owe you First for our lives, then for our liberties, For curing of our wounds with your faire hand, And many other favours great besides, All which we treasure up here in our hearts, As in a trusty Cabinet. Lucinda Sure the man Seemes of so gentle nature, that he would not Be so unkinde, as to repell the suit Of a poore love-sicke Lady.âaside. Will you grant me One boone in lieu thereof, and you shall make me A ten-fold satisfaction. Amand. For your good We will expose our lives unto all hazards, For we account them yours, and not our owne, Since by your meanes we live, and doe enjoy them: What's your command? Lucinda Sir, since you doe acknowledge You owe to me your life and liberty, Your cure, and other courtesies besides, I am endanger'd now as you were then. 'Tis now my turne, and I am like to suffer In all these things, unlesse your gentle nature And pitty doe relieve me. Amand. How sweet lady I doe beseech you comes it? doth the theefe Rapinus dare to offer violence Vnto your chastity, or threat your death Vnlesse you yeeld unto him? I will soone (So much I'm oblig'd unto your goodnesse) Finde out a way to send that fiend to hell, Although I suffer for it twenty deaths, If this procure your feare. Lucinda This is the least, (Although I know not well how to avoid him) Of what I suffer. Amand. Let me know it then: Your life and liberty endangered? In need too of a cure, and not that way? Strange mystery, unfold it I beseech you, That if it lye in my poore power, I may Make knowne how much I love and honour you. Lucinda Sir, 'tis a secret, and requires to be Spoken to you in private all alone. Should J not be unmannerly to crave Your friends retirement for a little space? Consol. Madame, there needs no ceremony in Your Ladiships commands to us your vassals. Exeunt. Lucind. Now you can help me by an easie way Without your hurt, for know J am your Patient, But am asham'd to lay to you ope my wonnd: Imagine in what nature 'tis by these My teares, my blushes, my abrupted sighes, My broken speeches, my dejected eyes, My strange unwonted passions: more, I am Your prisoner too by the commanding power Of all subduing love, now 'tis in you To cure me, 'tis in you to give me life And liberty at once: O be not cruell Faire Prince, but help a poor distressed Lady, Who craves but love, and in that suit your best Construction: take it not in the worst sence, Nor thinke me ought immodest, though I have Open'd my sore which was procured by Your most majesticke carriage. Amand. Heavens defend So great a Princesse, and so beautifull, Of such imperiall fortunes, should descend So low in thought, to looke on such a wretch As I am, being the map of misery, Griefes Embleme, yea the tennis ball of fortune, Toss'd by her angry Racket evermore Beneath the line, into a thousand hazards For her desport. I love you better Lady Then so, to worke your downefall, and should ill Requite your favours that way: you that may For beauty, birth, or fortune, match with any The greatest Prince of the terrestriall orbe. 'Twere sinne in me not to be pardoned, To wrong you with my love in way of marriage, Who can assure you nothing for a dower But sorrow and affliction, Lucind. Sure you cannot, Although you would, conceale your selfe from me, Whose love discerning eyes have found you out To be admir'd Amandus, and survey'd Each lineament a part, with such regard As Painters use in limming of a piece, You'r drawne within my heart, from head to foot. Amand. I grant it Madam, that I was that Prince You pleas'd to name, but now have nothing left me But the bare title, but that ayery name, Poore eccho of Damascus, would I might Loose that and life, the shadow with the substance, Then I were happy, but my fates alas I feare reserve me for more misery, If possible, then I have tasted yet: Therefore let all avoid me as the plague, Lest they should be infected with my griefe. Lucind. Doe not suppose your pleading poverty, Or ought you can alledge, to wrong your selfe, Hath power to turne the streame of my affection Another way then now it holds its course, Or to repell my argument of love: No, no, the plea is stronger, though you were Poorer then Jrus (I invoke as witnesse Of this my vow the power that made me yours) Yet would I rather be conjoyn'd to you In nuptiall bands, then be the wedded wife Of any other Prince, although he were Richer then CrÃ¦sus, and heaven knowes I could Content me better in this prison here, (So you could love me, and I might enjoy you) Then in the Persian Palace, if I lye, Let Cupid shoot you with a leaden dart, And with disdaine kill poore Lucinda's heart. Amandus O deerest Princesse, take deliberation, And enter into thought of what you are, Of what I am, and what the Persian is. Then you wil soone call home these wandring thoughts, And place them where they shall be worth your love: In me alas they cannot, for although I had not lost my Country, though my kingdome Had still beene mine, and though I now enjoy'd My former regall dignities and state, Yet should J count my selfe too meane by farre, To match with you the mighty Souldans heire, And onely daughter, now I scarce deserve To wait on you in nature of your servant. Lucinda This shall not serve your turne, these vain excuses And wrongfull reasons urg'd against your selfe, Shall not prevaile at all: the more you strive To stop the current of my swelling passions, The more they rage within this breast of mine, And in the end will overflow and breake My heart if you prove cruell, and put off My hopes with such weake shifts and poor delayes. Come, grant me love, and seale it with a kisse As an assurance. Enter Rapinus listning before at the dore. Rapinus. What is this I heare Spake by Lucinda to this captive slave, Come grant me love, and seale with a kisse As an assurance? well I'le be reveng'd By all the Pagan gods; ignoble strumpet How dar'st thou wrong me thus, and in my Cave To court my prisoner? was't for this thou did'st Deny my suite, and still from time to time Delude me with delay, that thou might'st act Thy shame, and make me pander to thy lust? Base Whore was this thy drift? for this abuse I'le presently enioy thee, if thou yeeld Without constraint, I'le keepe thee to my selfe, But if thou strive, or make the least resistance To crosse my will, when I have satisfi'd My lust at full, I'le put thee o're to be Vs'd and abus'd by every common souldier; Come huswife I must teach you true obedience. Offers to ravish her. Lucinda. Helpe, helpe. Amand. Base villaine offer her no wrong, But turne thee upon me, although unarm'd I dare thy utmost power. Rapin. Then thou shalt feele The fury of my rage, have at thee slave. Drawes his sword and assaults him, Amand. defends himselfe with a stoole, and at last closing with him, hath him at his mercy. Amand. Now I will dye thy sword in thy own bloud, Which thou didst think to make deepe drunke in mine. Rapin. O stay thy hand for faire Lucindas sake. Ama. That hastes thy death, &amp; puts me in remembrance Thou wouldst have ravish'd her. Lucinda. Sir let him dy, And free us all from this captivity, Never a better time then now to doe it. Amand. Then it is done, take that, and breath thy last. killes him. Lucinda. Heroicke Prince now shew thy pitty on me, And as thou hast releas'd me from this theefe, And from the violence of loathed lust, So free me from the violence of love By taking me unto thy wedded wife: I will refuse no danger, nay no death To beare thee company, live here or travell Throughout the world, I'le Lacquey it a foot With sweet Amandus; can you be so hard And cruell to me? sure when Ladies wooe Hard are the shiftes love doth constraine them too. Amand. No more of this sweet Lady till we have Order'd the businesse that now fals upon us: The theeves we need not feare, for I have them Firmely at my devotion through distast And discontent they did receive against Rapinus in his life, they will not stirre (I know) one foot in his revenge, but rather Render me thankes for acting of his death; Come let us goe, to better our poore state We must confirme these men yet in their hate. Exeunt. Enter the three thieves. 1 But my masters shall wee be still ridden thus, and undergoe the burthen patiently, without seeking remedy or revenge? 2 No we'll suffer it no longer, if we do wee shall deserve Mydas eares y'saith. 3 And Acteons hornes too for our future fortune. 1 Then wee are all resolv'd to doe our best to dispatch him, are we not? 2 All the shame of the world befall him that is against it. 3 And al the bastinadoes that do grow in the deserts light upon him; lets devise a way now to worke our revenge, will you study the plot? 1 Since you referre it to me, I will not be long about it, lets release the stranger, give him armes, make him our Captaine, and cut Rapinus throat; how like you this? 2 Excellent well, it cannot chuse but advantage us greatly, for the stranger is wonderfull valiant, you know wee had costly experience of it, and he seemes of a generous disposition besides, that would not forget such a courtesie. 3 This wil I beleeve, so oblige his gentle nature as whatsoever boote we take, he will not trouble himselfe with it, but divide it freely among us; will not this be excellent my hearts? 1 But who lies here all this while weltring in his owne bloud and we not see him? our Captaine Rapinus, tis hee, come here and congratulate his death. 2 Blessed accident! 3 This befell according to our wishes, and hath sav'd us the labour to put our designe in excution. 1 Ha Captaine do you lie there y'faith, remember how often you gave me the bastinado, I could now be reveng'd upon your dead carkasse, but I will now only satisfie my selfe with laughing over thy body, ha, ha, ha. 2 To whom are we bound for this courtesie, I marvell, I cannot imagine to whose courage to impute it unlesse to the strangers. 3 Tis he, it can be no other, he shall be our new Captaine for the deed, do you consent to it? 1 By all meanes we approve it, he shall have his act presently. 2 Come let us; find him out, and know how the businesse pass'd betweene Rapinus and him. 1 Agreed, and offer him our service and recive his commands. How apt a Souldiers mind is still to range, And doth desire his officers to change. 2 But stay let us not leave Rapinus body lie here unburied, lend me your hand for charities sake. 3 That's well remembredâexeunt with the body.

King Tell Perseus we doe not doubt his power, But dare his utmost malice, and because We would not have him live in ignorance, Give him to understand that we know nothing Of what befell the Princesse, and this is The first time that we heard it; for the wrong He doth us in invading of our land, Without just cause, he shall be answerable: So much informe thy master. Exit Herauld. Herauld 'Tis my duty. King This is strange newes, Alecto is it not? The Souldans daughter rap'd, and we not know it Till now, and yet done in our kingdome too? How should it be? let us consider of it; I now have found it, and 'tis probable. How thinke you? may it not be by the theeves That live among the desarts? so it is Vpon my life, for that way she must passe To travell into Persia, and we know Their strength too well: these villaines in this warre Will more annoy us then the Persian army: Heaven looke upon us, for we stand in danger, Between a forraigne and domesticke foe: We saile between the rockes, the shelves, the shores Of Scylla and Charibdis, yet we may Escape those dangers, if th' immortall Gods Commit the ballance to Astrea's hands, To weigh our causes; let our fortune be According to our right, and we agree. Exeunt. Amandus, two of the thieves. Amand. Now fellow souldiers, since you have committed This place of Captaine to me, and submitted Your selues to my command, I must reduce you Into another way, another forme, Another course of life more honourable, And make you worthy of that glorious title And attribute of souldier, which as yet You but usurpe and wrongfully apply Vnto your selves: I doe assure you this, You shall not have occasion to complaine, Or to repent the change. 1 Sir, you shall mould us Into what forme or fashion you please. 2 Our mindes shall be as soft and tractable To your commands, as Virgin waxe unto Th'impression of the seale. Amaand. Then I will give you documents of warre, And rudiments of martiall discipline. But first you must shake off unworthy thoughts, And sticke to vertuous actions, ere you can Rightly attaine this knowledge, you must not Seeke by unlawfull meanes to gather wealth, Or to extort by violence and wrong, What doth not rightly appertaine to you. You must not rob poore passengers, nor take Them prisoners on their way, you must forget Your out-rages, your murthers, rapes, and thefts, And put on other habits which may suit This our profession. 1 But then how shall we Subsist and live? Amand. I'le tell you how you shall More rich then ever, and yet honestly And honourably too. Enter Col. and Gentleman. What newes my friends? Colon. Strange unexpected newes we have receiv'd, The Persian army is at hand, and ready To enter in the desarts, and are marching In hostile manner to th' Arabian Court, Burning and spoyling all the land before them. Amand. But can you understand what mov'd the Persian To enter into warre against the King, And to invade his Country? Gentle. 'Tis because He was inform'd, though falsly, that the rape On faire Lucinda was committed by The Kings command, and she detain'd at Court. Amand. How came you Sirs by this intelligence? Gent. We had it from a prisoner, which our men Tooke of the Persians, who it seemes, is one Of the fore-riders of the camp. Amand. Here's worke, And brave employment for you, here you can Get wealth and honour too, and doe your King And Country service: here's boot enough, Winne it and weare it; now courage my hearts. Enter the third theefe. 3 Sir, from the top of yonder lofty mountaine, The sentinell discovers dust to rise From up the champain country, and doth heare Drums beating of a march, and trumpets sounding, Which makes us doubt an army. Amand. Let them come, Wee'l stand upon our guard for to receive them, Yet wee'l doe things discreetly too, and not Give battell rashly, for the Persian army Is rich and mighty, not for us to deale with But upon great advantages: attend My words, we'll lye close in our ambuscadoes Vntill we heare the vantguard of their army, And battell is march'd by, then on the reare We will fall on, and fercely give the charge Vpon the narrow passage, so before The vanguard and the battell can assist, We shall cut of their baggage, and retire With all our wealth into the Caves and Mountaines Safe from the strongest forces of the world; I'le bring you on and off with honours Sirs. All 3 Goe one brave Captaine with successe, and we In all thy bould attempts will second thee. Exeunt After a flourishing charge, enter againe with much wealth. Amand. Now fellow souldiers is not this more honorable, And profitable too? to beate an army, Then to oppresse poore pilgrimes, and the like, Who travell for devotions sake unto The tombe of famed Mahomet at MÃ¦cha? Sure you must needs confesse it. 1 We extoll And magnifie this change of discipline. 2 and will conforme our selves to any thing You shall command us. 3 Yea so much we love, And honour your brave spirit and resolution, As these your fathfull friendes shall not more close Stick to your side in fortunes doubtfull chance Then we, whom you have honour'd with the name Of your poore souldiers. Amand. My kinde thankes to all: Now for this wealth which we have purchased With glory to our selves, I will distribute And equally divide it 'mongst you all: As for my part, I will not take one denier, But freely give it you in recompence Of your good service. All 3 Wee'l not yeeld to this, All shall be yours, our lives too at your service, And we beseech you take it. They offer him the wealth, he refuseth it. Amand. 'Tis a meed Due to your valours, therefore I command you Enjoy it freely: now I must acquaint you Further with my intentions, which shall be To raise your fortunes, and procure your good. In briefe, I doe resolve forthwith to send A messenger unto th' Arabian King, Your native Lord, to offer in his ayd All our assistance 'gainst the Persian Prince, And to come over to him with proviso, That he shall pardon, and no more remember The trespasses you did commit against him: Which he will willingly embrace, I know, And more besides, bestow preferments on you, Endeer'd the more unto us by affection For this our service, which serves as a prologue To usher in our welcome: condescend you To this I doe propose? 1 With willing hearts. 2 And count it a religious piece of service To helpe our King and Country. Amand. I am glad You are so alter'd in your inclination And rudenesse of your nature: but where is The faire Lucinda, and old Consolario? Enter Lucinda and Consolario. Faire Lady, welcome, you have made this place Poore by your absence. Lucind. But you have enricht it With your faire presence Sir. Amand. I'm sorry Lady That we must part so soone: the Prince of Persia Is come to fetch you with a mighty army, Who claimes you as his wife, therefore in justice And conscience too, we cannot hold you from him: You shall have all that is your owne, and more, Wee'l wait upon you as becomes the state Of such a mighty Princesse, with a guard To safe conduct you to the Persian campe. How is your minde dispos'd? Lucind. Vnkinde Amandus, More cruell farre then proud Narcissus was Vnto the constant Nymph that lov'd him so, More salvage hearted then the boy Adonis, That scorn'd the love of Venus, these were never Halfe so belov'd as you, yet will you leave me To dye in your disdaine, and put me over To him I cannot love? unkinde Amandus! Amand. Sweet Lady, thinke I doe preferre your good Before mine owne, misconstrue not my words, For I doe speake this for your great advantage, If you conceive me rightly, but we will not Force you to any thing against your will: I'm sorry that you will participate Our evill fortunes, and refuse to live The Persian Empresse, 'twas for this I did Perswade you unto what I did. Lucind. O let me Goe with you Sir, and if you cannot love me In nature of your wife, yet I beseech you Respect me as your handmaid, who's still ready To waite on your commands. Amand. You do confound me And make me blush to heare so great a Princesse To speak to me in such an humble key, Who do confesse my selfe your lowly vassaile; And since you're bent so much to wrong your selfe And to forget your state, my life shall stand 'Tweene you and danger; Madam you have heard Our resolution to assist and helpe Th' Arabian King against the Prince of Persia; Will you goe over with us? Lucind. Where you goe There doe I bend my journey. Amand. Consolario I must dispatch you to the Arabian King About this businesse, wherein I'le instruct you Particularly more before you goe. Consol. My faith and care shall not be wanting in The trust you shall commit unto my Charge; How I may doe you service is my study. Amand. So then al's done but this, to crave you hand And lead you wheresoee'r you shall command. exeunt. Enter the Persian and the Embassadour of Ãgypt. Perseus So let this most inhospitable Land Suffer our wrath, so let the whippe of warre Inflicted on this countrey by our hand Lash them severely that have violated The lawes of Nations, and therein committed What even the base Barbarians hate to thinke off; Now let the speedy messenger of death The king of weapons, call'd the sword unsheath him And drinke his fill in bloud, let every souldier Freely enjoy his pleasure, make his pillage And do the greatest outrage that he can; We will no longer now suppresse our fury But let it burne unto full height, the cries Of ravish'd Maids and Virgins shall no more Enter our eares, the humble supplications Of undone Orphants shall not move my pitty, So much I am incens'd against the King. Embassad. I would divert you from this cruelty Great Prince if you would heare me, and alleage Some reasons too to fortifie my speech, First, tis a beauteous country, and the world I thinke not parralels it, next you do Intend it for a conquest, will you spoile So sweet a habitation, and lay waste A seate will make you proud to be enthorn'd in? If this be not sufficient to induce you To spare the rodde of vengeance, let respect Vnto your Princely fame with-hold your hand; What sordid blot, what foule aspersion can More taint the candid honour of a Prince Then tyranny upon poore seely wretches: You know as much my Lord, and histories Show many foule examples of such tyrants Whose names live in reproach to these our times: But Sir have you receiv'd the newes? my mind Was bigge to bring it forth, before your speech Hindered the birth. Perseus. Newes I heare none but that The fearefull King dares not fight a battle, We must enforce him to it, or pursue him As greedy grey-hounds do the heartlesse Hares, Till we have tane his Crowne and Life away; Now what is that you heare? Embassa. Quite contrary To what you last diliver'd for they say He is prepar'd to fight, and with his army Meanes speedily to seeke you, all the theevee That in your passage through the desarts did So damnifie your army, have submitted Vnto their King, and serve him in this war; His force is much augmented, and you're like To to have a speedy triall of your fortune. Perseus. And after that a speedy strong possession Of all this Kingdome, I am confident That with our breathes we shall destroy them all Powr'd forth in anger, our great multitudes Will scater them as Wolves a flock of Sheepe, Suppose his army doth amount unto Some fifty thousand men, which is the most His strength can raise, our army doth exceed it By halfe the number put away our horse, Whose gallantry is spoaken of by all The Nations of the World, and held to be The best for service in the universe: Can he resist our Force? or the Arabian Stand up against the Persian in a battle? Speake your opinion. Embassa. Sir you know the chance Of warre is doubtfull, and plum'd victory Doth oftentimes deceive great expectations, Besides dame fortune is a fickle Lady We know not how to trust her, but if things Be justly carryed with an equall hand, If iugling be not us'd amongst the fates, Tis evident your army must o'recome, But judge we cannot till we see th'event. Perseus. We doubt not nor despaire of the successe But from this talke, I have beene oftentimes Resolv'd to aske you, but till now forgate What might be gather'd hence that faire Lucinda Your Princesse, in this time of her restraint Sollicites nothing for her liberty Nor writes a word unto us of her state, We heare she lives at the Arabian Court. Embassa. I heare so too, and worthily entreated According to her birth and high degree. Perseus. This makes me to admire, nay to suspect The streame of her affection is diverted Another way, and holds no constant course, It must be so, else being so entertain'd And high respected in all points of honour Would any man conjecture, that the King Would hold her 'gainst her will, if she desir'd To come unto us, now she hath forgate us, And may be too, her honor and good name, Then we are grosse abus'd, fool'd with a match And must be full reveng'd; I have no patience, My Lord Embassadour doth your opinion Goe hand in hand with mine? Embassa. Then I should be A traytor to my King; dare I presume To thinke the Princesse should destaine her honour? Farre be it from my thoughts, Sir I must tell you You are too rash in passing such a censure, And your too unadvised tongue exceeded The decent bounds prescrib'd him not to touch A Princesse reputation. Perseus. Thou durst as well Have eaten fire, as utter'd these bold words, If twere not for the lawes that are observ'd Betweene all Nations, that Embassadours Be well intreated, this great priviledge Hath brought forth this presumption; know your selfe And how farre you may goe, else I shall be Though loath, a breaker of the antient custome. Embassa. Sir, I'm commanded not to be in place Where I shall heare my King, or any branch Sprung from that royall stock traduc'd in fame, But to make answer roughly, not to stand A silent auditour, or a dumbe statue, Without or sence or motion. Perseus. I commend thee Old man, and love thee for it, we will be Soone reconcil'd, and will lay the fault Of our contention to the heate of youth And choler of old age; now our affaires Call us to fight a batell, all my thoughts Must be imploy'd in this, whereby I shall With glory rise, if not with honor fall. Exeunt. The King, Lucinda, PhÃ¦nicia. King. Now whilst the trumpets sound, drums beat alarm, The cannons roare, the armyes joyne and charge, (Which sometimes were the musicke we delighted) Must old Arabia lay his armes aside, And sit at home with Ladyes by command Of natures law although his life and crowne, Lye at the doubtfull hazard of the day: Heaven blesse our armye, we that cannot fight Will send our prayers up to the Gods for aide, And wake there sleeping justice with our cries: Great Princesse you are sad to see us so And of your silken disposition seeme To have a fellow feeling of our sorrow, Cheere up, we doe bescech you, and deere daughter Be joyfull too, we shall have good successe My better Genius tells me. Lucinda. Who commands Great King your army 'gainst the enemie? King. The valiant Prince Amandus, whom at length We did perswade to take that charge upon him. Lucind. Then be assur'd the victory is yours, For all thinges prosper under his conduct. PhÃ¦nic. Madam you doe revive our dying spirits With wordes of comfort, happy time that made us Enjoy your conversation, blest occasion That brought the noble Prince unto our ayd Whom heavens defend from danger and returne Home safe conquerour cround with victory. Enter a Lord with newes. King. Here comes a Lord with newes, what tidings bring you? To wether side doth victory encline, And bend her flight? Lord. t'is doubtfull yet my Lord Where she will light, she hovers in the aire Vncertaine where to rest her, sometimes ready To light upon the prince his white pavilion, Sometimes upon the Persians; had we not Fought at such disadvantage as we doe, The glory of the day had not so long Betweene us beene disputed: never was An army better order'd for a battell, Then ours is by the Prince, who in his person Doth wonders in the field, breakes through their troops And strong battalions, when oppress'd too much Wisely retraits with honour: hard's the fight That is between them, and the issue stands Yet in suspence. King We must attend more newes, Another Lord intelligencer comes. Enter another Lord. How speeds the battell? Lord Sir, it was endanger'd On our side when I left it for the mighty And strong brigadoes of the enemy: Brake the battalion of the Duke Alecto, And charg'd quite through the body of that squadron Where he himselfe commanded, if he be Alive or dead, escap'd or taken prisoner, I have no certaine knowledge. King Then our army Is halfe defeated, for Alecto doth Command as great a part as Prince Amandus: But let me not despaire, untill we heare The utmost tryall. Enter a third Lord. Lord Long live mighty King, I bring you joyfull newes of victory, The Prince hath wonne the field, redeem'd the Duke Out of the hands of death, and when the battell In all mens judgement was supposed lost, He by his valour, and his wisedome both, By none but by the mountaneers assisted, Recover'd it againe, and tooke the prey Out of the Persians jawes, routed their troops, Brake their battalions, and reduc'd their order Into confusion, fighting hand to hand, He brought the Persian Prince unto his mercy. And tooke him prisoner, then the Persians fled, And we pursu'd them; great the slaughter is, And infinite the riches that is tane In costly plate and jewels, gold and silver Was never a more braver overthrow. Each common souldier now is like a Captaine, With scarlet hose, buffe coat, and tossing feather. There's no distinction in their habits seene. King Thanks to the gods for this our victory, Next, to their instrument Damascus Prince, Three times a day wee'l smoake your sacred altars With sweet perfumes, and come with adoration To offer to your shrines, three times a night. The Priest shall sprinckle o're with bloud of beasts Your sacred places, and with zeale performe The ceremonie of your sacrifices. Enter the first Lord againe. Lord The Prince Amandus, and the Duke Alecto Are come in triumph wich their prisoners, And wait your royall pleasure. King Pray them from us They would be pleas'd to enter. Enter Amand. leading Perseus prisoner, Alecto hurt, the Colonel, the Ambassadour of Egypt, the Gent. all in triumph. Amand. Vnto your kingly hands I here present The Prince of Persia prisoner, what the chance Of warre hath made me master of: I freely Give unto your possession, all the wealth Is gotten in this Persian overthrow, And I am glad my fortune did present Occasion to me, whereby I have shown Vnto your Majesty, my love and service. King Victorious Prince, sent to us from the gods, (Whom we may terme the patron of our Country) Thy same reward thee fully, for we cannot; Let the shrill trumpet of thy vertues blaze thee Throughout the world, let monuments be rais'd, And trophies built to speake thy living praise. Let every piece and picture made of thee, Be gaz'd upon by mens adoring eyes, And this thy conquest crown'd with Lawrell boughs. Prince Perseus welcome, we receive you now I know a most unwilling guest, you shall not Be entertain'd beneath your royall state, Although our prisoner by the fates decree. Please you salute these Ladies, one of them I doubt not but you know. Perseus. The faire Lucinda, salutes her. But who's the other that so faire out-shines her, As diamonds glasse. aside. salutes PhÃ¦nicia. That lovely touch hath fill'd My veynes with a new fire, and quite put out The former flame within me. also aside. Embas. Madame, I crave the honour for to kisse Your Highnesse Princely hands. Lucind. My fathers servant And trusty subject, sent in his affaires To forraigne Princes, I am glad to see you, We shall have private time to talke at large Of our affaires. King My royall guests I feare We keepe you from your rests, whose wearied bodies Would faine enjoy the benefit of sleep, Toil'd with the sweating labour of the day: Please you to walke, wee'l shew you to your lodgings. Exit King, then Perseus leading Lucinda, Amand. PhÃ¦nicia PhÃ¦nicia You grace me Sir. Amand. Madame, I understand No honour like to this, to kisse your hand. Exeunt. Amandus at one doore, PhÃ¦nicia at another they meet. Amand. Most faire and beauteous Princesse, My thoughts did tell me as I lay abed, There was a wonder to be seene this morne, A Sunne whose glorious beames eclips'd Apollos As much as he doth Cinthias, she the starres. I finde they were no lyars, for behold I see it verifi'd, my gazing eyes Are come to blesse, and to adore your rise, PhÃ¦nicia. Faire Prince, it was some false suggesting dream Abus'd your sleep, and wrong'd your expectation. You finde not what was promis'd, though your wit Would faine excuse the leaving of your bed So soone for nothing: doe you use to stirre So early in a morning? Amand. Seldome Madame. But if such Nymphs attend Auroras traine, I'le hate to be a fluggard, and more often Frequent this place, the garden of delight. PhÃ¦nic. You are not like another time to jeere me For early rising. Amand. Nay, faire Princesse leave not This good and wholesome exercise, the graces Will dye for sorrow then, the mounting Larke Will not reade o're his mattens, nor the Thrush Warble forth ditties with delightfull throat: Faire Philomela shall no more be heard To chant and charme the hearers of her songs; And all the other winged choristers Will hang the head, and weep in silent teares, If faire PhÃ¦nicia grant no audience: Harke how they doe salute you, every one Striving to passe, and to excell the other In sweet harmonions notes to please your eares: O what a consort's this! if you but marke it, There is a certaine mutuall emulation Amongst these pretty birds, whose musick's sweetest, Hath attracted most your kinde attention, Proud to be overheard by beauties Queen. PhÃ¦n. Sir, you have learn'd a pretty art indeed, To understand the languages of birds, And tell their meanings: I have read of some Could well interpret that way, but beleeve not: You use it row in a poeticke sence, And so I take it, I should make another Construction of their singing that they chide me, And say I am not modest to adventure Alone without my Maids into the garden. The wronged Philomela most of all Vrgeth her griefe, and bids me take example Of her too much credulity of man: I was to blame to come so weakely guarded I must confesse, nor would I change a word With any other man besides your selfe Alone in such an houre, so much I trust Your vertue noble Prince, and worthy thoughts. Amandus My humblest thankes for this high priviledge Bright goddesse that you daign me, let my lips Pay dutious tribute to your lilly hands I doe beseech you Kisses her hand. PhÃ¦nc. Sir I now leave you, For feare I should be miss'd, and so fall under The censure of black tounges, which take delight To spot the reputation of a maide; I should be loath to give the world occasion Even of the least suspition, yet I must Dispence with my returne a little longer To doe one freindly office in behalfe Of a distressed Princesse, you may guesse The scope of my intent in these few words. Amand. Who doe you meane, the faire Lucinda Madam? Whose angry stars made so unfortunate, As to bestow her love on me unworthy, Whose state is such, as that I cannot make Reciprocall returne of her affection. PhÃ¦nic. I must impute that to your cruell nature, (Pardon me Sir) and to no other cause, Else what should make the Princesse so contemn'd? Is beauty wanting? no the envious 't wretch That breathes this ayre, must be inforc'd to say, Her portion's large that way, the curious 't eye Can see no blemish her beanteous face, Is youth decay'd then? no, 'twere sinne to thinke it, For flowers and Roses spring up in her cheeks, Halfe white, halfe red, most purely intermixt. Is vertue banish'd? O me thinks my tongue Profaned is for asking such a question So much improbable! will you alledge She is not great enough in birth or fortune? That will not stand in law, for 'twill be prov'd She is the greatest Princesse of the world; If beauty, youth, vertue, and high descent Accompany her greatnesse: what is more To be required in a princely Bride? Amand. I grant it Madam, that she comes not short Of what you speake her, but abounds in all Perfections of the body and the minde, But yet this cannot binde me to become Disloyall to the Saint, whose temple was Long since erected in this heart of mine, Before I saw Lucinda, J'le adore No other goddesse in my thoughts but she, To whom I sacrifice my heart and soule; I know your vertue's such, as not to urge (My reasons thus reveal'd) a thing unlawfull: O no, you hate to further such a suit, Faire Princesse, so unjust. PhÃ¦nic. Would I were she He loves with such devotion, but alas I doe despaire my fortune. aside. I have done. Farre be it from my thoughts to make a breach Of love and loyalty between two hearts, Vnited in themselves; but since J have Made this discovery, I beseech to know, (Pardon a womans curiosity) The Mistresse of your thoughts, J must not be The second time deny'd. Amand. You doe impose Such a command upon me, as I know not If I shall more offend to disobey Your will in saying nothing, or in uttering What you will have me speake; if it displease you, The fault is yours, not mine, for I had beene Content to smother up my woes in silence; Know then, sweet Princesse, that J lov'd as soone As fourteene yeeres crept on upon my age, A beauteous picture, such as rare Apelles Durst ne're presume for feare, to imitate, Lest he should come farre short, and shame himselfe: I serv'd this shadow with a zealous heart, Sixe yeers, but yet the heavenly substance knowes not How much I suffer'd for her love so long, J dare proceed no further. PhÃ¦nic. Come, you must Vnfold this darke Ãnigma, I doe long To heare your story to the end; but if You be so modest, let me see the picture, And I'le dispence the trouble of your speech. Amand. Madame 'tis yours, to doth the blushing morne Cast a most pure vermilion on her cheekes When PhÃ¦bus doth salute her, wonder not Admired Godesse that I am so bould, To court a beauty doth deserve the stile Of more then mortall, love compell'd me to This high presumption, and confirm'd me in it By telling that his mother lov'd a mortall, Iuno and Pallas did the like, he swore, Yea chast Diana though she were so coy, Cupid wil be depos'd upon the booke Would sport in private, upon Latmus top, With faire Endimion once a shepheards boy; Descend a little from your heavenly state, And looke upon a wretch, who layes his life Now at your mercy; can you grant me love And life, divine PhÃ¦nicia. PhÃ¦nic. Noble Prince, My tounge can now not found the negative, Although I faine would, for my heart commands That instrument of speech who in this thinge Is all affirmative; I never could Dissemble what I thought, and therefore tell you I'm yours, if you be mine, so firme united Vnto your love as death shall not disslove The gordian knot is ty'd betweene us two: But Sir we doe forget our selves to stay So long together here, suspitious eyes Will overlooke our actions, and I feare Alectos malice and his jealousie, See where he passes by, we are discover'd, Come let's away, next meeting shall conclude, If fates doe say amen, loves interlude. Exeunt. The Prince of Persia, Lucinda, the Embassadour. Perse. Madam we heare you're fallen of from us In your affection, and preferre Amandus In your best thoughts before the Persian Prince, How can you answere this, and save your honour? Lucind. I'le lay the fault (if any be) on Love, Chide him not me; I was obliged to The valour of Amandus for my life And honour, when they both endangered were By fierce Rapinus, was not this a tye To make me love him? Perse. Yes but not so much To doate upon him as I heare you doe, Your reputation I must tell you Lady Suffers reproach &amp; scandall and herein You undergoe, the censure of bad tongues Which will not cease to blaze you. Lucind. Sir you are A most unworthy Prince to tax my fame, I never thought you other, though I were Enforc'd to entertaine your love embassage, My heart ne're condescended to my jeurney, For fame had told me what you were though rich In the externall fortunes of the world, Yet poore in the internall faculties And vertues of the mind, which do adorne A Prince more then his greatnesse; I disclaime All interest you can or may alleage In my affection, for I scorne the man Shall question my good name. Perse. This doth confirme Your foule disloyalty, your owne tongue almost Tels me you have beene false, I do believe it, Else would you not have broake your plighted faith, Nor staid with poore Amandus when you might Come over unto me without disturbance; Is he to be put in scale with me? An exile banish'd from his native home, A poore distressed Pilgrime? what although He were sometimes Damascus petty Prince, He now is but a begger, and at best, When most he flourish'd in his state and fortune, Was then but worthy to attend my traine, And could you be so prodigall of love And favours on this man, as to adventure The shipwrack of your honour and your oath, The high displeasure of the King your Father, And your perpetuall ruins? I am glad The match is broaken off, and by your meanes, I am not guilty of the breach of faith. Were you endow'd with both the Indies wealth And were the daughter of great Alexander, Were you ten times more faire then you are, By al the gods we worship and adore, I would not marry you to weare a Crowne Acteon should lay claime too; Perseus bed I trow, deserves to have a Maiden-head. Offers to goe out the Embassadour staies him. Embassa. Stay, in the mighty Souldans Name my King I do defie thee unto mortall warre For this base wrong, and foule contagious spot Thy leprous mouth hath vomited against The Princesse reputation, looke to be Call'd to a strict accompt for this abuse. Perse. I do not feare thy King, but sleight his force As weake and feeble to incounter mine He durst not looke our country in the face In angry armes, we are more apt and likely To enter on his confines with an army. Lucinda. And be taken prisoner, valiant Prince, As in this Country with so small a force; You'ave reason sure to boast your mighty power Tis so redoubted by your wit and valour, Experience showes it. Perse. Lady of lost honour Your jeering cannot patch your broaken credit, I will divulge you, and your Fathers Kingdome Shall pay the wrong you did me, so farewell. exit Perseus. Lucind. Iust heavens beare witnesse of mine innocence, And cleare me of this foule aspersion which This villaine casts upon me undeserved, If I have plaid false, let the greatest plagues You can inflict fall on mee, let the earth Gape and devoure me, let your thunderbolts Light on my head, and strike me to the center, But if I'm guitlesse (as you know I am) Returne your plagues on him that is the authour Of those my wrongs, and let him justly suffer The utmost of your rage, that by his fate The world may know his scandall was but hate. Exeunt. The King, Alecto, with attendants. King. Nephew we understand how intimate And deare you are unto the Persian Prince, How much he honoureth your society Above all others, you can well informe us What entertainment he doth give his fortune, And how a prisoner suites his lofty mind. Alecto. At first he storm'd and curs'd his angry stars, Revil'd the fates, and rail'd against the gods, Refus'd to eate or drinke, banish'd all sleepe From entring in his eyes, lock'd up himselfe Within his private study all alone, Commanding none upon his high displeasure Should offer to disturbe his meditation: His high swolne heart, was big with angry passion Vntill another farre more powerfull wrought A contrary effect, and that was love, For gazing on the Princesse peerelesse beauty With surfetting delight, a sudden shaft Sent from the curious circlet of her eye Stroake him unto the heart, and there withall Cupid.The winged archer, sprung up from his stand And tooke him prisoner, now he languisheth, But pleasingly doth take this second chance, Submits with patience to the will and pleasure Of faire PhÃ¦nicia Lady conqueresse, And glories to be manacled by her Whose prison he esteemes, and doth preferre Before the Palace of the greatest Kings. King. This thing is motion'd to us; how think you Can I bestow her better, or find out A marriage greater or more honourable? Ale. You cannot though you sought the spacious world From one end to the otherâI must turne My thoughts unto as many severall shapes As Proteus usdâaside. Have you propos'd this thing unto the Princesse? King. Not yet but now we do intend to do it: Goe bid PhÃ¦nicia hither to repaire Vnto our presence, we must speake with her. exit attendant. How will she entertaine the motion thinke you? She cannot sure dislike or disapprove it, What's your opinion Nephew? Alecto. I should thinke so, But for one barre that lyeth in the way Were that tane off al scruple were remov'd. Enter PhÃ¦nicia. PhÃ¦nici. Did you command me hither to repaire Vnto your presence Sir? King. I did PhÃ¦nicia, And thi's the businesse, daughter you perceive My care and study of your future good, And Fatherly affection: I am old And cannot live long by the course of nature, If I might see thee marryed as becomes Thy state and fortune ere I left the world, And settled well my Crowne for thy possession, I then should welcome death, come when it would, And these gray haires descend into my grave Without disturbance, there is offered now A marriage, shall advance thy regall state Above the clouds, and make thee overtop The greatest Queenes and Empresses that are. PhÃ¦nic. Vnlesse it be Amandus I shall be The most unhappiest Princesse of the earthâaside. Please you my royall Father to acquaint me, Who is the party meant? The Persian Prince, He loves and serves you with a strong devotion, Yea doth even jdolize you in his heart His saint and goddesse; he hath se'd unto me My liking might procure you to his wife, And I have granted what he did demand; I know your vertue's such and your obedience As not to stand against our will and pleasure, Especially when it presents you nothing But what is for your honour and high fortune. PhÃ¦nic. Please you to heare me, this you do propose Is most unlawfull, and my conscience tels me It were a sinne to thinke off: for you know The Prince of Persia is betroathed to The beautifull Lucinda, and shall I Be guilty of the breach of faith betweene them? Farre be it from me; I beleeve he is Inconstant in his love, and apt to change From one unto another, his large titles Shall never winne me to his wavering humour, I rather would content me with a match Inferiour farre so I might marry vertue, In him indeed I cannot, for not only Fame but experience manifests his vices. King. Come, come, you are a foolish girle to make These vaine excuses to put off your good, You do presume too much upon our love And tender nature, we have beene too fond And given you too much of your will; unlesse You do conforme yourselfe to our command, We shall be are o're you a severer hand: Get out my sight, and thinke upon your duty. Exit PhÃ¦nicia. Is this not strange Alecto, that my daughter Is so averse unto her good? you tould me? Iust as she entred that there was a barre Lay in the way might chance to stop the match, What is it prethee that we may remove it? Alecto. She loves Amandus Sir, and he loves her, I over heard their courtship in the garden, Their amourous discourse, and protestations Of love and service, such affection showne In action, gesture, speech, as greater was not Express'd betweene faire Hero and Leander: Their eyes stood fixt upon each others face, Their tongues were sometimes mute and could not utter Th' abundance of their hearts, then would their sighes Supply that silence, till they had recover'd The instrument of speech to make it move, I never saw more passion us'd in love. King. This makes me wonder much that her ambition Beares such an humble wing, we must not suffer This businesse to runne on, what though we are Bound to Amandus in a high degree, Yet not so much his benefits oblige us As to conferre our Daughter and our Crowne Vpon his merits, whose poore state is such As he can give her nothing for a Dower: This must nor shall not be, our full indeavour Shall be imploy'd this love to breake and sever. Exeunt Perseus Alecto, Perseus musing. Alecto. Why how now noble Prince, within a dump? How come you so dejected in your thoughts I do beseech you? hath your love sped ill Vnto the faire PhÃ¦nicia, or some other Ill accident befall you, that you are So melancholy Sir? Perseus My dearest friend, Welcome; the mistresse of my thoughts hath slain me With too much cruelty alas, for when I marched with my army led by love, And came before the fortresse of her beauty, To lay my siege there, how she playd upon me From all her batteries, but when I began To make approach, then from her angry eyes Flew balles of wilde-fire, and granadoes follow'd, Which scorch't and rent my heart, but last of all, The cannon of her mouth so thundred on My poore besieging thoughts, as I was faine To raise my siege in haste, and get me gone, This is the poore successe of my designe. Alecto D'ye know Sir what's the cause you speed so ill? Perse. I have been thinking on't, but cannot lay The blame on any thing but fortunes malice, Can you informe me better? Alecto Would I could not. I have found out Amandus hath her heart, By what smooth guile, or Syren oratorie He wonne her to himselfe; I am not able To give you satisfaction, or to guesse it: This ancient enemy of yours and mine, (For who stands ill affected unto you, Shall ne're affected be by me your friend) Hath now the second time deceiv'd your match. Wrong of all wrongs! disgrace ef all disgrace! So to be cheated of two princely brides: Sir, you must be reveng'd, deepely reveng'd, Or else your Princely name will be reproach'd With foulest infamy that can be spoke. Blinde men and boyes will sing you in the streets In Ballads, and at length, 'twill grow a proverb, So patient as the Prince of Persia, If you sustaine those injuries which lye So heavy on your Princely reputation. Perseus I am even burst with rage and jealousie, That villaine, vagabond, that renegado, Borne to be author of my sufferings, Shall not out-live one day; I am incens'd Beyond all measure, and I cannot longer Containe my selfe, I'le finde that begger out. Alecto Stay Sir, be patient, and doe things discreetly, I'le joyne with you, and have a hand as deep Or deeper as your selfe in your revenge, For the great love I beare you: by the gods I am as much touch'd with your wrongs, and am As zealous in your cause, as you your selfe. And now to worke to bring our ends to passe, I have a dainty powder here that was Ordain'd for such a purpose, which will worke Effect unto our wish if it but fall Into his cup, or light upon his haire, 'Twill soone dispatch him with a powder hence, Such vertue is therein: we shall corrupt His Barber by rich gifts, or by some other Vnthought of way as yet, procure the same To be imploy'd and us'd upon the Patient This physicke is ordain'd for: like you this, Or shall we yet devise some other way? Perseus These figges are too too common, and besides, Jt doth not sute the honour of a Prince By such a way of cowardise to bring Destruction to his foe; although Amandus Deserve from me an ignominious death, Yet 'cause he is a Prince, and bred in warre, J faine would have him, like a souldier dye Nobly, by sword or pistoll. Alecto. He shall fall then According to your will, and in this manner If you approve it Sir, what if you send A challenge to him for to meet you single, A foot or horsebacke, in the field to answer These shamefull wrongs he did you? I will be Ready to rescue you when I perceive You need my help with certain friends of mine, Who will lye close the while, and undiscover'd, Vntill we see you have the worst, then forth Wee'l breake, and soon dispatch that traytor Prince. Perseus This, noble Duke, is daintily devis'd, I shall be gratefull ever to your love, And shew it in a large and ample manner, Well I'le dispatch my challenge instantly. J build upon your ayd, you will not faile me Jn time of my extremity. Alecto The flouds Shall faile to pay their tribute to the sea, Before I breake with noble Perseus. Perseus I'm confident of thee my dearest friend, Adue, untill we meet, our worke to end. Exit Perseus. Alecto This now begins to work as I would wish; The shallow witted Persian thinkes my aymes Doe beare a wing with his, and my ambition Is bounded by his love: I fish'd to take His good opinion with mine angle wit, Not to advance his ends, but worke mine owne. Alas poore Prince, he thinks I am his friend, And on that plat-forme grounds his resolution: He is deceiv'd, I'm friend unto my selfe, And enemy to him as to Amandus. J hate them both, as being both my rivals: Rivals unto my love, and to my kingdome: Neither must live, neither survive the other. I'le let them sight till one of them be kill'd, The Persian shall in vaine expect reliefe, Although distress'd: the conquerour shall dye By me and my associates: these remov'd The way unto my Crowne,, lyes smooth and easie; The Princesse sure will breake her heart for griefe. The King I'le poyson, then Alecto raigne King of Arabia, crowned by thy braine. Exit. Amandus solus. Amand. A furious challenge, and it speakes the man All in a fire that sent it, but extreames Are seldome permanent, I doubt 'twill prove But like a sudden flash that's soone burnt out: This is the time and place, but how comes it The Persian is so tardy? this proud paper Stuft full with ostentation, made me thinke He would not be the last man in the field. What, is his courage cold, or doth he now Begin to take advis'd deliberation Vpon the matter, that he stayes so long? I should not thinke so neither, for a Prince Cannot so much forget this reputation, No sure, he'l come, some businesse of import, I doe beleeve, detaines him; I'le attend His leisure here with patience, if my thoughts Would but descend a little from their height, I would consider too what should beget This fierce challenge, but he comes, I must Prepare to entertaine him. Perseus Here before me? This honour I could hardly spare you Sir, You came before the houre appointed, else I could not be prevented. Amand. Punctually I did observe the time, but to what purpose Are we come hither? to discourse and talke, And nothing else? I doe expect some doings, Some wonders too by you performed upon me, If I may credit this your salutation. Is the fume vanish'd? Perseus Thou shalt finde it burne Afresh to fierce flames, it was my goodnesse That rak't it up in ashes, lest it should Consume thee, and thou die in ignorance, Before thou knew'st th'occasion, now I'le tell thee. Lucindas wrongs and mine call on my sword To doe the office of revenge upon Thy treacherous head, thou didst dissolve the knot Was ty'd between us two, and alienatest Her heart from me, thou robst her of her honour, And strumpettedst her fame, and not contented With this abuse, thou dost proceed yet further To doe me mischiefe with false filed tongue, To wrest the faire PhÃ¦nicia from my love: These are grosse injuries, and such as cannot Be undergone with patience, yet if thou Wilt urge thy suit no further to this Lady, But give up all thy right in her to me: I will forget thy former injuries, And count thee for my friend. Amandus Coward, villaine, Art thou my rivall in PhÃ¦nicias love? And doe I suffer thee to breathe a minute To utter these bold words, these defamations, These lyes and slanders; know PhÃ¦nicia hates Thy sight as a pernitious Basiliske; Here farther, reade my minde. they draw and fight. Perseus receives a hurt. Perseus Thou seest my breath Failes, if thou art a Prince, and nobly minded, Thou wilt a little intermit the fight. Amand. Breath then a little longer, though I might Iustly deny it, since we are not tyed To any such conditions in a duell: But wherefore doe you cast your sight about? I doubt some treachery, come, I'le delay The time no longer, there have at thee Prince. they fight againe. Guard well thy life, it is endangered. Perseus This may endanger thine if it hap right. Perseus fals. I faint and dye, hell light upon Alecto, And all the furies rend his soule in pieces; False perjur'd villaine. dyes. Amand. I doe smell a plot Layd for my life, his words betoken something. Enter Alecto and his associates. Alecto How's this! the noble Prince of Persia slaine, And his bold murtherer triumphing o're His slaughtered body? come, my noble friend Shall not dye unreveng'd. they fall all upon him, he defends himself, and kils two. Amand. If there be any Princely or royall bloud within thy veynes, Distaine it not for shame by such a fact, To fight at such foule disadvantage with A wounded wearied man, yet in this state, Though faint with losse of bloud, dismisse these men, And I will try my fortune out with thee, And if I fall, I'le say th'art noble too. Alecto No, if thou liv'st, my fortunes then must dye: I ayme, man, for the kingdome, and to gaine The love of faire PhÃ¦nicia, thou art a barre That hinders both, therefore must be remov'd: This plot I did contrive, not with intent To worke thy end alone, but Perseus too; Now it is finish'd, make an easie passage For life to issue forth me deare associates, There's one gap more, a floud-gate large enough. they all thrust at him, he fals. Amand. Most impious wretch, think'st thou the gods above Will favour thy so damnable attempt? Think'st thou to scape the justice of the heavens, And to hood-wink the gods? no, though thou hast Proceeded thus farre in thy villanies: Though thou hast slaine me by thy base treachery, My minde foretels thou shalt be soone cut off, And all thy hopes destroyd. Consolario, Colonell, Gentleman, Mountaneers. Consol. Where is my Prince? Where is he? torment to my wounded heart? Weltring in his owne bloud. Colon. How? heavens defend, What impious hand hath done so foule an act? Speake Noble Prince, speake quickly. Amand. Worthy friends, You're fitly come here to revenge my death, There stands the villaine, and his treacherous crue Who did procure it. Gent. We will sacrifice Their lives with speed, to pacifie your spirit; But that's a poore requitall for our losse: Villaines, our swords must send you hence to hell, Goe, and the furies give you entertainment. they kill Alecto and all his friends. Consol. Deare Sir, how doe you? speake to Consolario, Speake to your tutor, ope these lovely eyes, And look with pity on the aged face Of him that dyes for sorrow of your wounds. Deare sonne, speake comfort to thy fathers heart, (For so you bid me stile you to my death) I faint, yet let one word come from your mouth, To tell me that you heare my grievous moane, And I shall die in peace. Amand. Deare Consolario Thy cries have wak'd me from a pleasing sleepe, I love thee still in death and after death. Consol. But I'le die first, so, so my heart strings breake. Falles downe dead by Amandus. Amand. Helpe, helpe, my Fathers fallen in a swound. Colon He's dead sweet Prince and pass'd recovery. Amand. I'le soone be with him, for I must not loose His lov'd society; have you reveng'd My death, upon Alecto and the rest? Gent. Tis done, deare Sir, see where the villaines ly. Amand. Thankes dearest friends, one thing before I dy I shall request you if my failing breath Will give me leave to utter it, tis this, Tell faire PhÃ¦nicia my beloved Princesse The story of my death, tell how I love her, And grieve to leave her comfortlesse alone. I cannot fully speake my mind unto you, For death stops up the passage of my speach; Adieu deare friends, adieu, PhÃ¦nicia I dye thy servant, sweet PhÃ¦nicia. dies. Colon. Farewell brave Prince, we thy unworthy subjects Can but lament thy losse, and curse the fates For their unjust decrees; O could they not Have spar'd the chiefe of Princes to give lustre Vnto the world? could not they see his beauty And vertue shining in their glorious Orbes? His youth faire blooming? cruell destinies! Come now your shoulders honour with his Coarse Sweeter then all the perfumes of the Realme, Some to bring Consolarios body off; We'll see this fatall Land Arabia shall Provide them both a royall Funerall, Exeunt, PhÃ¦nicia, Saba her maid. PhÃ¦ni. Do I yet breath and live when he that was The comfort of my life lies dead and breathlesse? Can I behold another Sunne but that Which shin'd from his maiestick countenance, Eclipsed now by death, procur'd by treason: O heavens grant freedome to my troubled spirit To breake this prison of mortality, And so get loose with wings of swift desire To meete my lover in the Elizian fields. O how I languish here! harke blessed spirit Of my departed friend (for I believe Thou dost refine his aire) harke to my woes; Do not condemne PhÃ¦nicia that she staies So long behind thee, for thou know'st her soule Desires to take her flight into thy bosome, Nor shall she meete a stop (I am resolv'd) Amandus have a little patience yet, And then I come, tis but a minute longer Vntill I do contrive an easie way For life to sally forrh: my trusty maid My faithfull Saba, now assist thy Mistresse In this kind office that I shall command, Wherein thy love shall more appeare then ever: I loath this life thou see'st, goe fetch my Doctor I must take his advise; thou wilt be secret, I am assur'd, I have so often had Experience of thy faith; wilt thou dispatch, And bring him to me with all expedition? Saba. What you command my duty wils me do Without dispute, I'le instantly returne And bring the DoctorâExit Saba. PhÃ¦ni. Do so trusty servant And thy reward shall follow; I must worke This Doctor to my will by faire intreaties, And if that saile, by large rewards and gifts, I'le leave no way untri'd, nor unattempted, Vntill I do prevaile.âEnter Doctor with Saba. PhÃ¦ni. My worthy Friend And hitherto preserver of my health, I have a businesse now wherein I shall Make triall of your utmost love and trust, In which you must not faile me. Doctor. Gracious Princesse My life shall be imploy'd in any service You shall have need to use it. PhÃ¦ni. These are words Of ceremonious complement, you shall not Adventure so for me, tis but a trifle I would imploy you in. Doct. What ist, I do beseech Your Grace to tell me, and tis done with speed. PhÃ¦n. But I must have you sweare to execute The thing intended, and be secret too, Else I shall thinke you never were my friend. Doct. Tis some great matter that you bind me thus, But Ladies wils must not be disobey'd, Since tis your pleasure that I take my oath, I here protest before the gods above To do the utmost of my power therein. PhÃ¦. Well then, you know my love, you know my losse. You know the vertues of that noble Prince Whose death exhausts teares from forth mine eies And drops of bloud from my poore wounded heart; I am resolv'd to die and now no longer To carry such a heavy load about me Of griefe and sorrow, which doth overweigh By much the weaknesse of a womans nature; Kind friend you must be the instrument to send me Vnto the Prince Amandus, whose sweet spirit Shall come with mine, and hover o're your house, Vntill the whistling aire sound both our thankes: Come do this friendly office, you are ti'd Vnto it by your oath, you must not start, Or fall back from your former resolution. Doctor. You do but try me, Madame, if I will Prove such a villaine, sure you cannot meane Sincerely what you speake, or if you did, This is a thing unlawfull, there was nothing You could command me but this only thing That I would not performe, but pardon me I must dispence with oath and all things else To leave this deed undone. PhÃ¦n. And perjur'd prove Vnto the gods, and false unto thy Mistresse O cruell man! seest thou the paine I suffer And wil't not lend thy hand to ease my torment? Are all my favours out of thy remembrance? Could they not bind thee to this courtesie? Take pitty on mee yet, and here is gold Enough to purchase thee a Lordship faire, What say'st thou to me? Doct. I am doubtfull whether, To grant or to deny, but yet you have not Declar'd your mind at full; what must I doe? PhÃ¦n. Devise an easie way for me to die, Not in a common ordinary roade, Which many use by cutting of a vaine Or such like, to get passage to their blisse; I saw the PhÃ¦nix burning in her flames The other day, and was inamour'd off So sweet a death, I faine would die so too Your art can helpe me in the imitation. Doct. Tis true I can compose variety Of gummes, of drugges and spices mixt together, And make a perfume not unlike unto The PhÃ¦nix Funerall fire, whereby you may, Be sweetly smother'd lying in your bed, As she is in her nest, but I would rather You would desist from this your resolvtion, And make a tryall of my love and service In any other thing. PhÃ¦n. It is more easie To stopp the current of a swelling river, Or to remove a mountaine from his place, Then to divert my minde from this, whereupon It doth so firmly fixe, therefore kinde Sir Send me forthwith by this my maide (for now The time fits right) this excellent receit. Doctor. Your will shall be obey'd, mine shall give place. Come maiden will you goe? Exit Doctor and Maide. PhÃ¦n. Disptach her to me With all the hast you can, in the meane time I'le rest me on my bed, and never rise Vntill I see Amandus with mine eyes She lyes downe. This short, or rather this longe time I have To breath the aire of woe (for life is tedious To those that take no pleasure but in death) Shall be imploy'd wholy in meditation, How sweetly I shall passe unto my freind, And come unto him as in sacrifice, Mine altar smoaking incense and perfume. Doctor and Maide againe. Doct. Madame, I'm come my selfe to doe the deed, Doubting the maide should faile in my directions. PhÃ¦n. Most welcome, sacred priest, for that's the title Your office now requires, because you are To sacrifice me to Amandus shrine A spotlesse Virgin; nay delay no time, But presently about it, light the fire Whilst I attend the sweet asending flame Here in my bed with longing expectation To wrap my body round, dispatch J pray. Saba. T'is kindled, Madam, and a cloud offume Shroudes you from sight. PhÃ¦n. I smell a heavenly vapour Assaulting my weake breath, now Prince I come, Beloved Prince thy deare PhÃ¦nicia comes, Be ready to receive her, for her spirit Ascends up in this smoaky sacrifice. Saba She's dead Sir, for the sweetnesse of the fume Hath smothered her sences. Doct. 'Twas her pleasure She would not be disswaded from her purpose. I must be gone, here is no safe abiding. Saba. I dare not stay here neither, though her letter Be a sufficient warrant for our lives; I'le leave it on the bed, because the King May finde it if he chance to enter in. Exeunt Doctor and Saba. Enter the King with attendance. King How sweet my daughter sleeps and how her breath Perfumes the chamber o're like Arabs gummes, I'le wake my darling with a fathers kisse, She sleeps too long; how's this? her lips are cold, Her cheeks are pale, aye me, I feare she's sicke, I cannot feele her pulse, nor yet perceive The passage of her breath; O heavens, she's dead, A Doctor there with speed, my daughter deare, Speake to thy aged father: O shee's gone. Doctor, Lucinda, Emb. Colon. Gentleman. What say you master Doctor? is there hope To call backe life againe? Doct. My gracious Soveraigne, 'Tis too farre fled to be revok't, the art Of Ãsculapius could doe nothing in't, Nor all the power of physicke, nor the force Of medicine can helpe. King O then J am The wretchedst man alive, why was I borne To see this wofull houre? but what is this? My daughters will and testament, it may be 'Twill give me satisfaction of her death: 'Tis her owne hand and seale, these the contents. My royall father, please you understand, Despaire and sorrow for Amandus death, (Whom heavens ordaind the owner of my heart) Made me loath life, and seeke this way to dye In perfume like the PhÃ¦nix, none is guilty Vnto my death but I my selfe: deare Sir, I humbly crave you would be pleasd to lay My ashes in Amandus urne with his, That so my spirit may rest in quietnesse. King Thy will shall be perform'd, lye there gray hayres And aged head, think now no more to weare A regall Crowne, nor feeble hands to weild A scepter, thinke of nothing but a grave: J'm comming daughter, and I will surprise thee Before thou art aware, beloved corps! Help, bring it hence unto our bed chamber, That I may breake my heart, whilst I embrace The body 'tween my armes. Exit King, and the body of PhÃ¦nicia. Embas. What tragicke Scenes This fatall land presents? come Madame, let us Return to Egypt, to the King your father, And make relation of these sad disasters That have befaln in this our pilgrimage. Lucind. Let it be so since things have falne out thus, When I come to my native Land, my thoughts Shall shunne all pleasures, banish all delights, And live Dianas Votary I will, Till death shut up the remnant of my dayes. What course sirs will you take? Colon. Faire Princesse, we Intend to travell backe unto Damascus, Where we first breath'd, there to surrender up Our breath againe unto the Land that gave it. The Tartars swords, we hope will cut it off. Lucinda Nay rather goe with us, &amp; live in pleasure At the Egyptian Court, for I'le assure you High honours and preferments for the favours You shew'd me once in my captivity, And for his sake, whom yet in death I love, But I shall not participate in joy. Gent. Alas, deare Madame, we abhorre delights As much as you, since our delight is gone; We thanke your noble courtesie, but cannot Accept it, for despaire and sorrow doth Possesse our very soules, come, let us goe And leave this Land so much repleat with woe.
