      <field name="fulltext">The Scene, CORSICA</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Scena Prima. Feredo, Argales. Fer. 'Tis strange Argales, that our King, who ne're Till now was seene let loose affection's reynes, Nor patronize his power; but through the line Of his long life hath with so strict a hand To all so equal sway'd his scepter, as None ever yet was heard moane and lament Under the burden of Authority Or awe transcendent; should now Contrary to his wont, so liberall be Or rather so profuse in all his favours To this late-come Italian. Arg. Who can tell But this by you so much maligned stranger May merit all that is confer'd on him Of grace or favour; so the King remayne Entire in his impartiality, Letting the current of his favours flow Only as Bellamour's worth challengeth: Besides 'tis laudable, and is by all Both prays'd and practised to be courteous To strangers, specially to such who may In all their actions easily be discern'd For somewhat of much more than ordinary. Fer. He's but a private Gentleman. Arg. That last Conferres on him as much, nay more than ought, Set that aside, can doe; Gentrye, and all That doeth derive from good, the antienter The more to be esteem'd. We pictures deeme Drawn by some famous hand of former times Much more then modern ones; if then such prayse Be to the shaddowes given, for certain much Of more reflects upon the substances. But set all these respects aside, his worth Deserving what of good may ere betide him, And this set off by what you make a butt at, His being Gently borne; why should we curbe And prescribe lawes to others, which ourselves Who are the meanest of their vassals, nor doe Nor can make good. You are a private man, I meane no Monarch; yet are Maister of A fortune, which seates you in a condition Of being fawn'd on, su'd unto by many, Who forasmuch as doeth belong unto The tye of servants, owe as much to you As you to our great Maister; then peruse Your former private, if not present times; And tell me if your liking never bore You more to th'actions of some one then other? If this be true, as certainly it is, Why should we that to our superiours grudge Which to ourselves we arrogate? Fer. A Prince Should be more then a man. Arg. He should indeede Were he what you would fashion him to be, Nay, were all Princes of affections voyde, So voyde of man (for th'one word speakes the other) I doubt me whether, were it in your choyce You'd change a Cottage with a chayre of state; Tis true they're termed Gods, yet they must dye Like men, and if so dye, so live. But why should you so feare this growing tyde Should (may be) swell so high that it may drowne The neighbouring valleys? full five months are past Since his first coming hither and as yet He hath not tasted ought of princely bounty, As honours, riches; more then that 'tis true, His company as 'tis to all men else Is pleasing to the King. Fer. My feares foretell 'Tis much more pleasing to his daughter, her I have observed ne're to be so well In tune, or set upon so gay a pinne As when screw'd up by him. If this be so It well becomes us all to looke about; Who knowes how farre a handsome proper man And fairely spoken, may prevayle with one Who though a Princesse is yet but a woman; And I am herein interested more Perhaps then you're aware of. The great Duke Of Majorca, our neere neighbouring Isle, Who hath some months been present in the Court, (May be to you unknow'n) doeth labour hard This Ladye's good-will, and with his desires Hath made the King acquainted, who since he Can finde nought to object that may withstand His just desire hath thereto given consent, Always provided that his daughter be As well contented therewithall as he. This is a secret not divulg'd; for that The great Majorcan Prince, jealous of His reputation, as befits all men, And chiefely Princes be, covets not To be brought on the stage till he may by Some secret meanes sift whether yea or no The Lady can affect him, so that if The business prove once public he may be Partly assur'd of prosperous successe. As I am herein open unto you And free, pray be your secret unto me. Arg. Sr. for this favour I doe rest indebted, And till I heare it streete-newes rest assur'd From hence it shall no farther progresse have, And truly you have joy'd me much, for I Cannot o'th'sudden thinke on any match In all respects more fitting than is this; (aside) But hereof more at large to Bellamour. Fer. To give more ample field, wherein the Prince May of his Chivalry make demonstration The King at his request hath condescended To have a tilting which to-morrow next Before himselfe's to be performed; where The Prince as Challenger does all defie Who dare maintain his tenet false, which is That to persist in a neglected love Is greater signe of base and abject minde Than love or constancy. Arg. 'Tis an odde tenet for one who begins To make the blossoms of affection known. Fer. Assure yourself he'll prove in all his wayes As odde as now in this. He thinkes 'tis not Fitting a Prince to tread in beaten pathes, But to finde out or else make new ones; see The King appeares, with him his daughter, and With her the brave Majorcan Prince, close hand in hand. But marke again how she hangs backward; how She suffereth her body to be dragg'd Along by him, whilst by her eye men may Perceive her soule lock't in the Italian's breast. Scena Secunda. Enter the King, Florabell, his daughter, Philocres, Prince of Majorca, Bellamour, the Italian; Garamont, Montalto, Arnaldo, three young Lords; Lucina, companion to the Princesse, with Attendants. King. When thus attended, and [with] you, my fayrest, My dearest daughter, seated by my side, Me thinkes no monarch's mightier than myselfe. Phil. You were not Sr. to yeeld to any one In any thing belongs unto a Prince So long time famous through the Christian World, Were you your selfe alone here. We like to So many petty starres borrow our light From those beames which surround your Majesty, But cannot contribute or adde thereto The least of lustre. King. You meane brave Prince To shew your skill to-day in Compliments And Courtly talke, as you to-morrow meane To doe in feates of Armes, in this I'm sure Y'are excellent. I doubt not but you will In th'other prove as expert. Gar. So think not I, These talkers seldom are good spearmen. King. What's that you say Lord Garamont? Gar. My speare I say shall talke for me Sr. King. Of that to-morrow. You meane I see to break a lance with him. Gar. If so it please your Majesty give way. King. And you Arnaldo; you too Lord Montalto? Arn. I'le doe my best to prove he not deserves His Mistresse' favour who esteemes it not More happiness to sue, though all in vayne Where he hath once plac't his affection Then freely to enjoy another's love. Mon. You runne too much upon the counter-byas; I do not jumpe with you; but I'le maintain He merits not a favour who forbeares For some few gaynesayes. King. You brave Bellamour, What's your opinion concerning this? Bell. I surely think him much more happy, Sr. Then I shall ever be who doeth at last Though ne're so long in comming thereunto, Enjoy his soule's delight, his mistresse' love. King. You Bellamour set not so high a rate Upon your own deservings, as doe other men, And yet doe thereby much inhaunce their prize: For vertue's never so much prized by others As when not boasted of by the possessor: But either you have plac't your love too high, And therein made a breach on your discretion, Or else, if you your owne worth duely weigh, Who e're she be you neede not to despayre. Let me but know your Saint and I'le pleade for you. Bell. Your noble favours Sr. are now to me No newes, so deepely I have drunke thereof That till some wish't for meanes doe shew it selfe Whereby I may make demonstration Of my endeavours, ever humbly vowed And dedicated to your Grace's service, I shall forbeare the further running on The score, for feare of never coming off. Fer. Her eye is never off him. I'le not faile To informe the Prince thereof. King. My Lords 'tis late, and some of you perhaps May not be yet provided of such trimmes As for to grace to morrow's sport y'intend: Therefore 'twere best now to retire, each man Unto his tackling. You Lord Challenger Had neede come well prouided; for believe't, (For your to them unpleasing tenet,) all The Ladye's sides against you, and men say That women's wishes helpe to winne the day. (Exeunt.) Scena Tertia. Philocres, Lucina. Phil. My deare Lucina have you yet prevayl'd? Hath ought that you can say had power enough To worke me into Florabella's graces? I know your powerful speech is of such force, Your Art yourselfe therein to governe such As if you truely doe intend a blisse, You'll make the stubborn oake the haw-thorne kisse. Say then, is't blisse or bane that you doe bring? Luc. Fayre Sr. although the taske you set me on All things consider'd duely as they ought Be of the hardest sort e're undertaken, (aside) (For God he knowes, I'de rather sue to you Then sue for you to another,) yet such force Have your commands on me that like to Lawes Of Medes and Persians I have them obey'd. I have not lost the least occasion Proffer'd of highly setting forth your Highnesse prayse. Nay, I have [even] ta'ne occasions Ungiven to let her see how fit a match You'd be in all respects for her; of bloud A Prince as she a Princesse: of estate Not misbecomming her, and which was not Least worth respect, your state so neere to her's, Of personage a husband for a Queene, As by this light you seeme to me to be. I have set forth your wisdome, your discourse, Your feates of Armes; what not? and this With all the skill and Rhetoricke I have. Butâ Phil. But what? pray draw not out so long My doome of life or death; seem'd she well pleased With your discourse? did she not thinke your talke Too tedious? gave she you fayre hearing? Luc. Faith 'twere in vayne to flatter you with hopes When there's small hopes to flatter you withall. As oft as I named you she'd turne her head Another way; still I pursuing her, She'd cry'd Nay, pish: faith if you will not leave This theame Lucina, I'le leave you; and as I though pursued to blazon forth your worth, She'd say, halfe this said of another man Would better pleasing be, and much more true. In fine, I feare her heart is else-where set: Therefore deare Sr. forbeare furthur pursuite Of this nice wayward one and strike a Doe Will stand you fayre. Phil. Who can that other be? Enter Feredo. See where Feredo comes in happy time, He'll doe his best, I'm sure, to learne who 'tis That she affects; that known the cure's halfe done. I'le teach him whosoever he be, what 'tis To be my Rivall: or if she will needes Place her affection elsewhere, and scorn me I may perchance read him and her a lesson They shall not soon forget, Feredo. Fer. Sr. 'Twas partly therefore why I now came hither; Take it upon no small presumptions She dotes upon the Italian, Bellamour: And that you may rest more secure, see where They come link't arme in arme; Sr. if you please I think 'twere good we did a while withdraw Where not by them discover'd we may heare What passes 'twixt them, so your selfe may be A witnesse both to that you heare and see. Phil. 'Tis well advis'd: Let's in, if this be true I'le turn a new leafe, and bid love Adieu. Scena Quarta. Enter Florabella, Bellamour. Flo. My fairest love, my dearest Bellamour, What meanes this sweet, though sullen sadnesse, which Sits on those cheekes? what sad? and I so nigh? Bell. Your pardon, dearest Madame, I'de forgot The happinesse caused by your Highnesse's presence, Or rather, to say true, your Highnesse presence Caus'd me forget myselfe; but say my fayre, My soul's farre better part, what's to be done? You say, Philocres doeth by private meanes Your love importune; he's a neighbour Prince, And one on whom 'tis like your father would Gladly bestow you? we must now make use Of time, and take him by the forelocke, else 'Twill be too late, and I for ever shall Have cause to curse my fates which brought me hither. Our soules are knit, and mine shall sooner grapple With death, though pourtray'd in most ghastful shape, Then ever suffer dissolution. Flo. I do believe thee, and do hugge myselfe For making such a choyce; I'le rather begge With thee then feast it with the greatest Prince alive. She Idolls mucke and durt that ballances Or state or wealth with true content, such as Doe they possesse who joy in other's love. As for Philochres, I'll embrace Fire 'twixt mine armes thus, 'till therewith I have Made myselfe sacrifice and sacrificer, Rather than be polluted with so foule A touch as his. Phil. 'Tis well, 'tis very well, Some now would let his anger straight breathe out And publish his dislikes, but so'll not I, My vengeance though defer'd shall yet be such As when it falls (and fall for sure it shall) Shall richly pay my patience interest. Love thus farewell, and wellcome dire revenge. [Exit Philochres] Flo. Why stand you mute so long, my Bellamour? If ought molest you, let me share thereof, For I will share in all your good and bad. Bell. Heard you not ever Madame, how that joy Or griefe excessive in an instant have Strucke many dead? if so I wonder I Survive, who share so deepe in both; my joy Will need no words to set it forth; 'twill be By all men easily guest at: it exceedes Expression. Flo. But whence proceedes your griefe? Bell. From selfe-unworthiness to think that I A private Gentleman, a stranger too Should be the cause of such ensuing woes To such an all-deserving Lady: one Who fit bride for an Emperour will though Bestow your selfe on me: To this I adde your father's losse, to whom I for so noble usage stand indebted; Your losse in loosing him, for sure he'll ne're Give his consent his goodliest Cedar should Stoope to a bramble bush. Flo. These are but trifles: But I too late perceive my errour, those Your feares foretell a want of love, and me Therein most wretched. Bell. Now Madame by my soul You do misconstrue me, which to make good Say what, and where, and when, and build on me. Flo. Then thus, I'le order take to have a Gally rig'd, And brought into our channel, wherein I Some evenings on the water will disport My selfe: this three or foure times done Will free us of suspicion: meane while I'le order take for all things necessary. Packe up my Jewells, and then packe my selfe Away with thee my Bellamour; we will For Italy; I'le wayte upon thee home To see that happy Countrey (for sure such It is) that brought thee forth; there we By means of Jewells, Cash, and other things Which I'le provide for, will spend all our days In love and plenty. Bell. Madame be mercifull, Let not your blessing flow thus all at once Lest I do therein surfett. My deedes, not words, shall speak my thankfulnesse. Flo. Well then, no more of this: you meane to tilt To-morrow do you not? Bell. Madame I doe, And doubt not but to make Philocres know There lodgeth more of worth within my breast, A private Gentleman, than his a Prince. And that of this I may be more secure Pardon me Madame, if I beg a boone: For all your favours amply heap't on me Worke like effect as well cook't sauces doe Which fill not, but provoke fresh appetite. You must or me deny or graunt one favour more. Flo. I rest assured you will nothing aske May misbecome my modesty to graunt, Nor your worth to demand, therefore proceede. Bell. That I may then in this my bickering With happy augure go more boldly on Bestow on me some favour, dearest Madame, That if at any time my forces fayle, Looking on it, and in it, whence it came, Like to Antheos, who by touching ground New forces got, I may with viewing it, My strength redouble, and make whatsoe're Shall me withstand, seeme smoake before the winde. Flor. 'Tis bravely said, and 'cause your worth to me So well is knowen I dare not feare successe, Here is a chayne of Oriental pearle, My mother in her death-bed left it me, With charge that I should never from it part, Save unto him to whom I gave my heart; Then since you have the one accept the other, Take this and keepe it As safe as I your love and memory. Bell. He must have Lyon's strength and foxe's pate Robbes me of this inestimable jewell, Rich in it selfe, richer in worke-manship, But richest farre above comparison In respect of the giver, for were this A peeble stone, or ring made of a rush, And by your fairest hands presented, I'de Not give it for what of worth the sea contaynes. But Madame it grows late, and I as yet Am not well-fitted for to morrow's sport: Pardon me therefore if with humble kisse Of your fayre hand, I this time bid Adieu, Where e're my body is, my heart's with you. Flo. Then we have made an interchange of hearts, When you are gone I'm sure that mine departs. Scena Quinta. Three Serving-men at one doore, Three Women at another. 1. Wom. Oh, heere be some will misinforme us: Pray, good brother, which is the way to the Tilt-yard. 2. Wom. I, pray forsooth misinforme us in the way, and if by your meanes we may compose how to see the tilting, we will not be ingratitude. 3. Wom. No, indeede will we not. I'le promise you for my part a dish of Curds and creame if you come to our Towne; and I can tell you there be youngsters in our Towne which would lick their lips to have such a promise. 3. Man. You are a promising woman, I promise you; and I promise you in requitall of your promise to performe the promise which now I promise unto you which is that I will place you where you shall see, and be seen, most deliciously. 1. Wom. O delicate man! and will you do as much for me? I am a poore simple creature, and can neither write nor reade since I cutt my thumbe the other day in paring a piece of cheese; but thereby forsooth, we be all playne-dealing women, and meane no harme, I warrant you. 1. Man. Marry, and I love a playne-dealing woman with all my heart, but you are not so forward in your promises of requitall as is your neighbour; what will you doe to show your thankfulnesse if I should procure for you so much happiness as to see what shall serve you twenty winter nights in relating it to your Grandchildren. 1. Wom. Indeede and verily, Sir, I have never a Grandchilde, but I have a daughter just 15 yeares old and as much since Simon and Jude's day last past; a pretty moather, and though I say it, who should not say it, as sweet a silly soule as any is within a mile of her head. If you please, when you passe by our Towne, to call in, you shall be exceeding wellcome. 2. Man. And shall your daughter bid me wellcome too? 1. Wom. Feare not that, I hope I have given her better nutriture then to show herselfe wayward and coye to such a man as you are. I am sure she never learn'd any such manners of her mother. 1. Man. I seeke no further engagement. Upon that condition I take you to my charge. 2. Wom. So Sir Serving man I perceive you and I must couple together; your two fellowes have promis'd to satisfise my neighbours, and I trust you will prove no flincher, you will doe as much for me, as they shall doe for them. 2. Man. Even as much as you may expect from a weather-beaten serving-man, who never feedes but upon luke-warme meate, half hot and halfe cold, and the better halfe eaten away. 3. Wom. Then since we are all agreed I am resolv'd to trust myselfe with my Champion; do you so with yours, and let us be quickly gone, lest all the best roomes in the scaffolds be taken up before we come. 3. Man. Stay but a little and you shall see the Tilters passe by in order to the Tilt-yard, and their Squires and Pages before them. I told you so, Hearke the Trumpets sound already. Let us all stand close here and see them passe. Trumpets sound, the Challenger passeth by, his Page bearing his Shield and his Squire his Lance. The King and Ladyes are above in the window. The Page passing by presents ye King with his Maister's Scutchion. King. A lovely bunch of grapes hang high upon his stemme, And he a bunch lesse lovely much doth eate. His motto, Chi non puo quel che vuole quel che puo voglia. To will the thing he can is good, For him who cannot what he wood. He seekes belike to fortifie his Tenet By proverbe, but no rule so generall is Which not admits exception. So will this, Or else you Ladyes all beleeve amisse. Another Tilter passeth by, in same equipage as the former, his Page presenting his Shield. King. A close-shut lanterne, darke as is the night, Which gives no light at all; yet hath a light Burning within, as by the witty motto May be conceiv'd, Ardor in occulto. He burnes in hidden fire; the more foole he, Or for concealing his affection, Or else for placing it so high, his hopes Can ne're attayne unto their wish't for end, And therefore he in silence doeth consume. A third Tilter passeth by, as did the former. King. An eye droppes teares upon a flinty heart, The Motto, Hei mihi cur video It seemes this Gentleman bewayles his lot For having cast his eye on beauty, where He can no signe of comfort yet receive. Yet sure his Motto, speakes him wiser much Than is the former knight; his teares doe show That he hath spoken though as yet in vayne. The Frenchman sayes Femme qui parle se rend. If therefore you Sir Knight, who e're you be Before your mistresse have your griefs lay'd open, And she hath lent you eare to heare your moanes, Doe not despayre, though this your weeping eye In her yet flinty heart make no impression. The teares which fall from thence pierce not by force, But may by often falling cause remorse. A fourth Tilter passeth by, and doeth as did the former. King. An arme from forth a cloud grasping a speare And underneath Dat gratia vires. Yea this is somewhat like, for this man seemes T'have fought in Cupid's campe and overcome. By his Impresa he would have us know That grace and favour doe give life to Armes. Another Tilter passeth by, as did the former. King. A man sunke in the Sea, only his head Borne above water by a Scepter, which Is by a hand supported from the skyes, His word Hinc sola salus. This man it seemes owes all his Liberty, His Life unto his Mistrisse, which he holds No longer tearme in then when she shall please Her hand of favour to withdraw, but whilst That succours him, he fears nor tempest, nor The fury of the Seas. May she be still Propitious: so now they all are past, And, Ladyes, say for what you now have seene, Which of these noble Warriers Goe most accompanied with your well-wishings, The Challenger I'm sure partakes of none. His Tenet frights all fayre maydes wishes from him. Flo. In mine they all doe share alike. King. Nay, daughter, that's impossible: I, who Have liv'd as many houres thrice told as you Saw never yet a game at bowles or Cardes, Or whatsoever other game, though they That play'd by me were all unknowen, but that My wishes did accompany some one More than the rest; therefore pray daughter speak. Flo. I to the second, third and forth wish well, (aside) But hope the fif't shall beare away the bell. Luc. I must confesse, if I could aught prevayle With my desires, they all should flocke about The third: he in my opinion Deserves most pity, who his love doeth place Where he's repay'd with scorne and fowle disgrace. Fid. Nay, there, Lucina, you must pardon me, The second's sure in farre worse case than he; He hath outgone the former, he hath made Knowen his affection; who but thither gets Is sure advanc't one step towards th'atchievement Of his desires, more than is he who yet Never found way to make his passion know'en. Therefore for my part may he victor prove Whom love consumes, yet dare not say he loves. King. Why so now; this is somewhat; heere's a theame That would admit a seriouser discourse Than now the time affoords: Ladyes, 'tis best We turne unto the fire to warm our selves Whilst they doe on their tacklings. (Exeunt above. 1. Man. How now my lasses? How like you this sport, heere will be brave doings anon. 2. Wom. The blessing of God light on them all, they are e'ne the gallantest men my eyes ever yet saw. 3. Wom. How bravely they strouted it! but who were those that talk't over our heads? 2. Man. The King, his daughter, with diverse Lords and Ladyes of the Court. 1. Wom. The King! whye, I had rather than a groat have seene his sweet face, 'tis a sweet face, I warrant you, is it not? I never saw him in all my life. 1. Man. 'Tis no matter, thou mayest say now thou hast seene him that has seene the King. 1. Wom. May I so Sir? marry I thanke you for it. 3. Wom. Pray, let us be gone; I am pitiously afraid we have tarryed heere too long; but neighbours, 'tis all one, for you must resolve to be thrust at, and crouded both backside and foreside. The Trumpets sound within, then still music: so the Act endeth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus Scena Prima. Lucina, Philocres. Luc. This your misfortune Sr. in being unhors't, And that so unluckily by Bellamour, Will more estrange your mistrisse heart from you, And settle it more firme on him; Therefore at length be wise and leave to follow An untam'd savage beauty, which the more You doe pursue, the more obdurate growes; And chuse some other Mistrisse: some who may Without or cost of sigh, or losse of teare Be wrought unto your will, some one who will As fast runne after you, as you do after her, The pleasure is the same, the payne far less. Phil. (to himself) She's strucke already, fastned in the net. And if I draw her not to land, and make Her serve for baite to catch more gudgions by My cunning fayles me. Luc. Sir, did you but know The sweetes of love, the delicates thereof, When two breasts fully fraught, doe intershocke And meet each other; vying which of them Should outdoe other in expressions Not only verball but reallityes; You would repent you had so late embrac't My wholesome counsell, and be sorry for Your time misspent. Trye it but once; you know not what it is Till you have triall made; if try'de you like It not, with ease you may fall off againe. Phil. There's none but common flesh will care for me, Such as will play the after game, as well With footboyes, as with me the foregame, Now that I have been baffl'd, beate to ground By Bellamour. Luc. Sir, you do injure much Your selfe, and those that as your servants love you, By ballancing your selfe with Bellamour. 'Tis true h'ath had the better of the day, But you may have the better of the night. I know a Lady (though myselfe doe say't) That loves you dearely, dearer then her eyes; Then all the world together put, and you Exempted thence, then as you'd pitty moove In other's breast, let it moove first in your's. Phil. Why that Parenthesis? why (though yourselfe doe say't?) 'Twill not prove you, deare Madame? will't? say. Luc. Alas! alas! I have at unawares Betray'd my self, but what remedy? fire Will out, and though long time rak't up in ashes It inwardly doeth burne the more; and doeth When it breakes forth break forth in greater flame. Sir, 'tis too late to cloake my love, since you Have gues't at it aright; 'tis I that am The party speaking, and the spoken for. Nor doe I blush at it; men are not deem'd For wise nor provident, who in a case That much concerns them, when they may themselves Without controll have their accesse unto The Judge or Prince's eares doe though employ Some other on their errand; y'are my Prince The Judge fore whom my cause is to be heard And censured; in your hands doeth lye The only power to bid me live or dye. Why then should I be blamed, or any one For doing that, to do the contrary To which were folly and they fooles that doe it. Phil. Madame, I'm much bound to your Courtesie, I wish I may deserve it; but so soone Quite to forget my Florabella seemes Harsh and uncouth. Luc. Pish! thinke I am she And 'twill be e'ne as good as if I were. Pil. In troth you say aright, 'tis all but thought, A very meere imagination. Y'have therefore wonne me, Madame, I am yours, Yet one thing as a favour, I would faine Begge at your hand. Luc. Speake freely and command. Phil. That when you please t'appoint a time of meeting You'd doe your best in all your actions, Behaviour and gesture to imitate My once-loved Florabell; that so I may Deceive my selfe, and whils't that I doe passe The time away in dalliance with you, May thinke it done with her. Luc. All this and more: I'le put on her apparell, the same cloathes And knots she wore the day before; for as Her bed-fellow I well enough may doe't. Phil. (to himselfe) How she outrunnes me, she'll not suffer me To speake, she's surely of the plot And I not know it; the successe muste needes Be good, the entrance thereunto's so happy. Luc. What's that you mutter to yourselfe my Lord? Phil. I say the entrance is so happy as There's nought but good which can preceede thereon. But, Madame, say what time will you appoint And place, for now methinks already My love to Florabella vanishes, And fixes here. Luc. Name you the place and time. Phil. What thinke you on to-morrow night, the place The Antichamber to the Princess' lodging. 'Tis not amisse; you easily may finde Some cause of rising from her, there put on Her cloathes i'th'outward chamber; where perhaps They're usually lay'd, where I'll not fayle To meete you. Luc. I, but how will you get thither? Her maydes lye alwayes in the inner roome And locke the doores when we are both in bed. Phil. For that take you no care, 'tis not the first Love-theft that I have made; as I remember There's a Balconye-window in that roome Which looks upon the water; be you there 'Twixt twelve and one at night, and I'll provide A silken ladder made for such-like feates, Which you when I am come shall cast me down, (Always provided th'one-end be made fast Unto the window) thereby I will climbe My tower of blisse wherein my Helene is. Luc. You must be sure to come alone, I'de not For all the world have any other know it. Phil. Thinke me not so profuse of what's so much By women valued, reputation. The Moone shines bright about that hour, yet least Or you or I may be mistaken when I'm underneath your window, to my self I'le say, I wonder what o'clocke it is. If you be there and all things as they ought Your answer is, much about two o'clocke, Thus we are safe, and none can us descry. Luc. It seems you are well-practis'd, you so well Provide for everything thereto belonging; But if all be agreed clap hands upon't. Phil. And lips too, Lady. Luc. So, all's very well. I'le in least this my absence breede suspition: Stay you a while behinde. (Exit. Phil. Is not this better Then storming rage? in which perhaps myselfe Might share as bad as he: thus without noyse I'll take revenge on Bellamour, and on His Florabella too in such a sort As they shall have small cause to thanke me for't. Scena Secunda. Philocres, Bellamour. Phil. And see where luckily comes Bellamour. Bell. Who knowes but that my yesterdaye's good luck May be an omen of succeeding blisse? As such a one I take it: I will in To my fayre Florabella, she I'm sure Partakes a larger share of true content Than I my selfe, in all that me befalls Of good or glory. Phil. Sr. a word with you Before you passe to your fayre Florabell, As you are pleased to terme her. Faith Sr. say Are you so proud of the successe you had In tilting yesterday, as nought can serve, No meaner fortune recompense you for't Than Florabella's favour! Bell. I'm betray'd, But come what will come, since I'm thus farre gone I will go through. Phil. Sr. by your leave You shall not 'lesse you make your way through me. Bell. Were you tenne thousand men, and she my quarrell I'd make my way through all of you. (They fight. Enter King, Montalto, Garamont, Arnaldo. (They part them. King. Now by my soule Sir, this is not fayre play Nor does it with your reputation sit Thus to revenge your selfe by private Duell, For what in publicke fayrely was perform'd, And we ourselfe spectatour. Phil. Mighty Sir, Your Majesty's mistaken, and since 'twas My fortune to receive the worst I'm glad 'Twas by the means of Bellamour, my friend, Whom I so love as I am not ashamed, Nor sorry for the blurre which I sustaine Since that it addes unto his glory; we Not dreaming of your Majestye's approach Were onely lying at our severall wards To try which was the better for defense And which the best to passe upon. King. What say you, Bellamour? I'le take your word. Was there no other matter in't? Bell. Sir, no. King. That No came dryly out, but I'le not presse Further into particulars; quarrells Are oft renew'd, friendship is seldome made By repetitions; let it then suffise, My pleasure is that all disputes heere ended You two shake hands and vowe a hearty true Reconciliation. Bell. Sr. 'tis more then needes. King. Give me your hand I say, your's too, Philochres, So, sweare a perfect love and amity, The which if either of you violate Know my displeasure hangs thereon. Phil. I sweare By this Majesticke hand, which thus I kisse, Never for ought that is already past To question Bellamour. Bell. On the same booke The self same oath take I for what concernes Philocres the Majorcan Prince. King. This Affayre's well ended, looke you both observe The oath y'have ta'ne. Both. Assuredly we will Sr. King. Then Garamont, and you my other Lords Let's to our sport intended. Th'evening's calme, And sure ere this the hawkes are sharpe, we shall I trust see sport. Gar. I, such my Liedge, As well befits a King to be spectatour. Methinks I doe already see i'th'ayre Your Tarsell gentle lessened to a larke Shoote like a thunderbolt upon his prey. Mont. 'Tis true, the sight's delightful, but the flight Best fits a king to see is when the Heron Wrought up by Teesars, the stout Gerfaulcon Is whistl'd off from fist, to see how first she sweepes The earth with wings, and seems to steere her flight A cleane contrary way, till by and by You see her come about, and worke herselfe By inch-meale up till she be got above The lofty Hearne; to see her when she's there Come powd'ring downe, till grappl'd with her prey, They tumbling in the ayre come both to ground. King. Will you, Philocres, goe along and you Good Bellamour? perhaps you have not seen In your Majorca, nor in Italy Such Hawkes as our's are. Phil. Sr. I'le forthwith wayte Upon your Majesty; I'le stay but till My horse be come, then haste and overtake you. Bell. I'le tarry Sr. and wayte upon the Prince. King. I pray make haste, at least wise that you may See th'evening flight, the which doth crowne the day. (Exeunt all but Philocres and Bellamour. Phil. Friend Bellamour: for so I now must terme you, And truth to say, did ever hold you such, Let's calmly talke together, and though I Might take it ill that you would goe about To interrupt me in my love-affayres With Princesse Florabella, (for 'tis like You are not ignorant of my addresses) Especially at this time, when I meane For wife her of her father to demand, Yet such is the respect I have always borne you That setting by my quality of Prince, And therein sure a fitter match for her, I'le as your equall commune with you, and Acquaint you with those reasons which doe moove Me to pursue her love; doe you the like To me, and if your reasons better be, More prevalent, of greater force than mine, Take't on a Prince's word, I'le not pursue My suite one minute further; but sit downe To you; marry I then will look for like Respect from you Bell. 'Tis reason, good my Lord, And since y'are pleased to make so fair an offer, I willingly doe entertayne the match, And by th'faith of a Gentleman, which tyes As much t'observance as a Prince's word, I now, if your Highnesse shew me reasons why You rather should or doe hope to enjoy Her love than I, I'le not alone sit downe To you, but doe the best lies in my power To helpe you in effecting your desires, Alwayes provided you doe nothing say But truth entire, and thereto take an oath. Phil. Most willingly, and to this oath we will Insert a clause of secrecy, that what Soe're it be, is, or by you or me Made known, shall by the other passe no further, But rest with him, as if it were untold. Bell. Then heere, upon these hilts, I swear by all That sacred is, by all that is divine, By th'honour of a Gentleman, by all My hopes (and in them may I prosper so As I doe keepe this vow which now I make) By fairest Florabella's eyes, and by Her love (which said, I'le say no more) That if Philocres doe to me make know'n Good reason why he rather should presume On Florabella's love than I; and doe Therein say nought but what is certaine truth, As I for my part heere doe vow to do, I'le cease from ever further seeking to Enjoy her love, and doe my best to helpe Him to his wish't desire; I further vow By all that formerly is said never To let ought I shall now from him receive Concerning this passe further then my selfe. Phil. A better oath I cannot thinke upon. And therefore in the selfe same words doe vow By all that's sacred, all that is divine, By th'honour of a Gentleman, by all My hopes (and in them may I prosper so As I doe keepe the vow I now doe make) By fayrest Florabella's eyes, and by Her love (which said, I'le say no more) That if that Bellamour to me make know'n Good reason why he rather should presume On Florabella's love than I, and doe Therein say nought but what is certaine truth, As I for my part heere doe vow to do, I'le cease from ever further seeking to Enjoy her love, and do my best to helpe Him to his wish't desire. I further vow By all that formerly is said, never To let ought I shall now from him receive Concerning this, passe further then my selfe. Bell. To witnesse I beleeve you, and beleeve You'll punctually observe the oath y'have ta'ne, Know what I know will trouble you to know; Yet be not you thereat with me offended, For Charity (men say) begins at home. Know then, that though I may be justly blam'd For having placed my affection So high, (and yet Love's bounds are ever boundlesse) I still have met such correspondency In all my love-affayres as would inflame A heart, less subject to take fire than mine, Nor should I e're have dared to make know'n My passions, but have rather chose to dye And smother out my heate in swep't up ashes, Than suffer them to breathe forth to a flame, Had not they met with as great signes of love As prone for birth in my fayre Florabell. This graunted, I have not forborne to use The best meanes lay in me to blow the coale, By whose sole heate my soule receiv'd her being, And have at last brought it to such a height Of heate, not to be quench't but by the like, As she hath freely given her consent To marry me, nay, runne away with me, For not without good reason, she dispayres Ever to get the King her father's liking, To this, (I must confesse) unworthy match, She two days since bestowed on me this chayne, Willing me weare it for her sake, as that She held most dearest, left her by her mother. This and much more of like I could informe, But heere's enough, I doubt not, to put down All you can boast of; I doe therefore crave The true performance of your vow. Phil. Is this All you can say? if more you have, speak on, Or else for ever after hold your peace; for I Am next to speake, you must no more reply. Bell. What more can fall within the heart of man? Outdoe you this, and take her for your paynes. Phil. I aske no more: but see you now put on As great a patience to heare what I Shall say, and beare it full as patiently As I have done Bell. I should be else to blame. Phil. Then know I knew as much as this before, God knowes full many a time hathe she of this To passe away the time discours't with me, Alledging she did all this, only to Set off our future blessings: to be briefe I know her carnally. Bell. Thou ly'est, false slave. Phil. Is this the patience you promised? Bell. 'Tis past all patience to heare her fame Set as a pattern to all women else Thus blister'd by thy base, false, venemous tongue. Phil. Hold, you by this see I dare fight, and in (They fight. A cause so just as this feare not th'issue, Yet can I not blame you for what you doe, Nor am I thereat angry; but when this Is made apparent, when as you your selfe Shall see this done, shall see me lye with her, You'll then beleeve it, and perhaps you'll then Repent this violence offer'd to a Prince Who freely hath unbosomÃ©d himself After a solemne oath of secrecy. Bell. 'Tis false, 'tis more than false; it cannot be, When I see that, may I ne're after see. Phil. Dispense but with your fury for a while, For some few houres, I'le aske no longer time Than this next night, and if I bring you not Where you shall see all I have said made good Resume your anger centuply'de and I'le Ingage my honour, more I cannot gage, To give you all fayre satisfaction. Bell. This very night? Dispense, my purest saint, My this night's loytering; I to-morrow will Make ample satisfaction, when he Shall not have face enough to looke on me Who now spues slaunder on thy spotlesse fame. Phil. All this I heare, and once more vow to meete You heere to morrow 'bout seven in the morne, Where you may take your due revenge if I Not this night shew you all that I have said. Bell. Shall I then sheathe my sword? I must, I must, Or in not doing it prove too unjust. Sir, I accept your offer, which you'd best Make good (yet were you better damn'd than doe't) Or I'le make you serve for a president To all backbiters, fowle-mouthed slaunderers. Phil. 'Tis a hard choise, be damn'd or done to death; You see Sr. I am merry; 'tis my cause, The justnesse of my cause that causes it. Meete me this night 'twixt one a clocke and two, O'th'water banke on which her chamber looketh, Place your selfe there where you may see unseene Behinde a tree just 'gainst her chamber window. Whate're you there shall see, beare patiently, And call to mind your vowe made solemnly, Nought to reveale that or you heare or see. Bell. My vow I will not fayle t'observe, for if (As 'tis impossible) it should prove true I'll ne're more see, nor heare, nor her, nor you. (Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Florabella sola. Flo. I am resolv'd, and doubtlesse well resolv'd, Better's a meaner life joyn'd with content Than scepters wayted on with thorny cares, For if well weigh'd, this worldly wealth and honour Are burdensome; who abounds in wealth His part thereof is least; he's thereby more possest Than he doeth it possess: greatest tytles As King or Queene are not true happinesse, But rather fetters unto liberty. The meaner subjects with more freedome doe Their harmlesse sport enjoy than soveraignes. But I much wonder Bellamour so long Absents himselfe from me, he is not wont To be so long away. Enter Lucina. Luc. What! all alone Fayre Lady? What's the businesse now in hand That brookes no company? may I partake Of ought that troubles you? Flo. I thank my fates There's nothing troubles me, my deare Lucina. The calmnesse of the Evening tempted me Missing of you to take the ayre alone. But now I'm glad w'are met: what drew you hither? Luc. My service to seeke out your Ladyship. You did not see the Prince of late Philocres? Flo. Nor care if I ever see him: pray leave Further discourse of him, or I'le leave you. Luc. Nay Madame, rather than give you offense In any thing I say, take heere my hand, I'le never ope my mouth concerning him. Flo. On these tearmes none more wellcome than yourselfe. Luc. Say then, what shall we talke on? shall's discourse Of love in generall? Flo. I know not what Love meanes, if you make Love your theame You must talke all yourselfe. Luc. A Lady past Fifteen and know not what belongs to Love! 'Twere strange if true. Flo. 'Tis not so strange as true. Luc. Pardon me, Madame, 'tis against my Creede, And as a woman I must not believe it. Flo. Whom do you love, Lucina? Luc. Nay, that's more Than I am bound to tell; but that I love I doe not blush to say, for 'tis most true, Once e're we dye Cupid will shew his power, And since 'tis so decreed, 'tis better we Give way to him whilst yong than when w'are old; I have heard it said and do believe it true, That there's no payne so great as when with dart Cupid doeth pricke the aged doting heart. Since then or first or last we must give way To his all-swaying scepter, 'tis best betimes When w'are fit fewell for his fire; but loe Philocres comes. Flo. And as he comes I goe. [Exit Florabella. Enter Philocres. Phil. What, all alone my deare? who was't, with whom You now were talking, and hath left you thus Unmannerly alone? Luc. Your quondam Saint, The Princess Florabella. Phil. O, was't shee? She needed not have made such haste away, I shall not her pursue when as you stay, So let her goe, 'tis you I come to seeke. Luc. Now you have found me what's the newes? Phil. Loe heere The thing I told you of, take this, And fayle not your appointed time, you know How to behave your selfe, what's to be done. Luc. Let me alone, to such an enterprise As this I neede no spurres. Phil. Well then begone Yet ere you goe, know I'll come in disguise, Least in mine own shape men might eye me more, And dogge me as I goe, Luc. I understand: You'll keepe your watchword? Phil. Yes. Luc. And I'le keepe mine. But say, doe lovers use to part thus calmely Without a kisse or two? Phil. 'Twas but forgot. This kisse will serve my love to feed upon Till it meet soone with more delicious fare. Scena Quarta. Three Men, three Women. 1. Man. Hark y'Sirras, I have been with my neighbour the woman you wot of, that fell to my share yesterday, where I have seen a very pearle of womenkind, of countrey lasses I meane. 2. Man. Who was't you saw? her daughter she talk't of? 1. Man. Who else? she hath a lippe man, melts in your mouth like so much suger or honey when you kisse her. 3. Man. Why then you have tasted her lips. 1. Man. I, and may live to taste her hips too, but no more of that till time serve: Mumme and catch a mouse, I love not these prating companions; they talke of twenty they never durst so much as dreame of, when your slye fellow talkes of none, and yet does more than dreame with twenty. 3. Man. Methinks a pretty dreame though doeth sometimes not amisse, but let that passe; hath she made you a promise? hath she given you a Rendezvous? a place where? a time when? 1. Man. Not too fast deare dapper Dicky, for feare of stumbling, she hath promis'd me to meete me much about this houre in this very place, and to bring two of her neighbours along with her, and a Tabor and Pipe, to give me and any two I shall bring with me a meeting where we may trip it for an hour or two, and afterwards as time shall trye, and occasion rest contented. 3. Man. Shall I be one, deare Hodge? 2. Man. And I, my lad of gold? 1. Man. To what end brought I you hither else? hearke, I thinke I heare them coming: see whether she be not a wench of her word or no. 2. Man. Is that first she? 1. Man. I marry is't. 2. Man. I like the second as well. 3. Man. And I the third. 1. Man. Why then we are likely all to be pleas'd. 1. Wom. You see, Sir, I'm a woman of my word, I love to say and hold, to doe as I would be done by. 3. Man. Marry, he that would doe by you, as you would be done by, may have his belly full of doing, I warrant him. But what say you, pretty mayde. 3. Wom. I'm come along with my neighbour heere, as you see, she said she would bring us, where we should see fine Courtnols. 2. Wom. I can daunce with them too; are you they, I pray you? if you be, we have brought a very feat Tabourer along with us. 2. Man. That you may know, pretty mayde, that we be the men you looke for, command your Tabourer to strike up, and we two to any two of them. 3. Wom. Nay, we'll all daunce, that's sure, we'll none sit by for looker's on. 3. Man. Then let me take you by the hand, whil'st the other two make the last couple in hell. 1. Man. What daunce shall's have? An old man's a bagge full of bones? 1. Wom. I never lov'd to have to doe with old men's bones. Play me The souldier's delight. 1. Man. Why then, you must play your selfe pretty one, for to my knowledge who have beene a souldier, their delight lyes most in such as you are. 2. Wom. Nay, that's as old as the beginning of the world, or Tarlton's Trunk-hose. Let's have Rose is red, and rose is white, and rose is wonderous bonny. 2. Man. For a wager your name is Rose, is it not? 2. Wom. It is indeede Sir. 2. Man. Why then, let us have it. 3. Wom. Nay, by your leave Sir, why rather that than Peggy Ramsey for my sake, or Joane's ale's new, for my other neighbour heere, whose name is Joane. 2. Wom. Then to end the strife, least we fall out before we fall in, let's have the new Daunce made at our last wake. All. A match, a match. (The musicke playes, and they daunce, which done they goe away in couples. Scena Quinta. Philocres, Bellamour. Phil. 'Tis now friend Bellamour that you must trye Your manhood, valour does consist no lesse In suffering than doing; then put on Your stoutest noblest resolutions, For I shall put you to't. Bell. Sir you may spare Your counsell; busy yourself about The making good your word, and be advis'd In what you take in hand. Love hath sharpe eyes, And is not easily deluded; you Perhaps doe hope to put some tricke upon me, But if you do, (for I shall soone perceive it) Thinke not to 'scape my hands. Phil. I crave no mercy, See, heere's the place where you must stand, to see What will to you be poyson, baulme to me. (Exit. Bell. He's very confident, and did I thinke He could effect that which he boasteth of, I would not live to see the triall made. But who knowes? he perhaps may have some plot Upon my life, and by some treachery May meane to kill me, now that he hath draw'en Me out alone at this so late an houre. 'Twas well imagin'd, sure it must be so, But I'le prevent him; Mines must be blow'ne up With countermines; and see where luckily (Enter Garamont with a closed lantern.) Comes Garamont, the man of all the world I should have chosen in a case of neede. He's stoute and valiant, trusty to his friend, And I for such a one have ever found him. I'le trye his friendship now, and if I winne Him to my side, I feare not though the Prince Bring twenty with him; better are two true men Than twenty knaves; their oddes i'th'cause Is greater than the other's in their number. Whether so late, Lord Garamont? Gar. Who's that? Bell. 'Tis I Sir. Gar. You, Sir, who are you? some knave Lying in wayte for cloake or hattes? Bell. Nay Sir When you shall know who 'tis you injure thus You'll sorry be; know you not Bellamour? Gar. I crave your pardon Sir. Bell. There's no harme done, But faith, say whether, at this time of night? Some Mistrisse heere about, some dainty wench, Some such affayre, I'le lay my life on't, is't not? Gar. 'Tis hard to halt before a cripple, you By your owne errand guesse at what's another's. Bell. Then Sir, let me obtayne a favour from you, A great one too, which must not be deny'de. Gar. 'Tis graunted e're demanded; I'le not fayle To wayte on you to morrow, to receive All your commands. Bell. My suite brookes no delay, 'Tis forthwith to be done. Gar. So I shall make My mistresse wayte in vayne. Bell. I know you doe Preferre a pleasure done unto a friend Before one houre or two spent with your Mistrisse, And least whil'st we dispute, I should let slip The opportunity wherein I am To use your friendship, ask no questions, Nor why? nor what? but doe your candle out, And stir not from this place, unlesse you heare Me call, which if you do, with sword in hand Make haste unto me; this is all I crave, And one halfe houre will end the businesse. Gar. Mistresse, then by your leave; Sir, I am your's, And for I see the businesse is of moment I rest the more indebted, that you'll please To use my service in't; heere I'le stay, And with implicite faith wayte your Commands. Bell. Thankes noble Garamont, but as you prize My friendship, stir not one foot further, till You heare me call. Gar. Your will serves for a Law. Bell. Then thus, like him who grovells in the Darke I seeke for what I would not find. 'Twas heere He bade me stay, he'll not be long a comming. Gar. Nor why? nor what? and come with sword in hand; These words implye not nothing; thus far off He may receive some injury e're I Can get up to him; pardon Bellamour If I a little doe transgresse. The Gods Doe know my heart; my meaning is the best. So now I'm neere enough; heere I may see What passes, and be readyer to helpe If neede requires. I wonder what he meanes. Enter Philocres with a cloake muffled about him, Lucina at the window, who at the watch-word given throwes downe the rope and he climbes up. Phil. So thus far all is well; see where he stands, Now if Lucina play her part as well As I have mine, the sequele will applaud Mine industry. I wonder what's a clocke. Luc. Sure 'tis Philocres, 'tis nigh two a clocke. Bell. Sleep I or do I wake? Sure 'tis no dreame. The rascall cringes, she fawneth from above, And I looke on; curst be mine eyes which serve For Conduits to convey so fowle a sight Into my soule: Ã´ that I had been borne Blinde, or indeed never been borne at all. I should not then have felt such paynes as doe Surpasse the tortures Hell inflicts on those Who false like her, have falsifi'de their faith. Since then there is no payne can equalize My present torments why should I deferre My lesse of paynes, if not my more of blisse? She who alone did give me life, for whom I onely coveted to live, hath taken My life from me, and gives it to another. Why then should I survive? to suffer payne Unheard of, not to be exprest; some would Advise revenge, and thereby heape fowle guilt Upon my soule; but I not covet that. May he enjoy that which she held too great A blisse for me, and since all men must dye I see no reason why so should not I. (He offers to kill himself. Gar. For shame Sir, hold your hand, what doe you meane? Is this the bravery of your mind; are you Not able to withstand fortune's first rubbe? This action would blurre all your former deedes, And sullye your so fairely wonne renown. Bell. Insatiate death! what pleasure doest thou take In still reserving me to misery? Thou like the Huntsman those poore soules pursu'est Which flye from thee, but doest not pleasure take In seising those that offer up themselves. And you Sr who thus hinder me from what I gladlier would embrace than schoole-boyes doe A play-day graunted, know if you had seene What I have seene, and knew what I doe know You'd be more mercifull. Gar. Sir I have seene All you have seene, and know all you do know And begge your pardon for that I doe so. My soule propheticke whisper'd me i'th'eare, Bade me the station leave you left me in, And neerer draw lest mischiefe might ensue. Since then thus dictated by my good Genius, I hope your pardon eas'ly will be graunted; Take better resolution then deare Sir. If you should thus put end unto your selfe Your death would publish forth your guilt, whereas If you survive there's wayes enough yet left To remedye or to revenge your griefes. Bell. All remedy is vaine. As for revenge I ayme not at it, why should I hate him Who coveted what I myself did covet? I rather his integrity applaude Who dealt so freely with me; so to free Me from those rockes on which my boate was bent. Why should I hate him more than he hate me? His passions are the same as mine, his fire Equally fervent, onely heere's the oddes, Mine doeth derive from Hell, his from the Gods, For so the sequell shows; yet justly I May playne of fals-hood in my Florabell. To what end serv'd those hopes plenteously She pamper'd me withall? yes, to set off Her joyes with greater gust; but truth to say 'Twas Tyranny unheard of, first to cause The flame blaze high, then thus to blow it out. But she's a woman: henceforth may he finde Like griefe to mine, that e're loves woman-kinde. Gar. Hate whom you will so as you love your selfe. Put up your sword and cease these whining moanes. Joyne you with me, or let me joyne with you, And we, for all your grave Philosophy, Will worke revenge; say what you will or can, Nought but revenge sounds sweet in injured eares. And whosoever't be hath done this deede My skill shall fayle, or we'll make his heart bleede. Bell. Sir, thus farre to obey you. (He puts up his sword. Gar. So 'tis well. Plucke up your heart man, I'le teach Florabell What 'tis to violate a plighted faith. Bell. Sir, as you would preserve what you have done, As you would favour winne of God or man, As you desire fruition where you love, As you love me, love goodnesse, love your selfe, Forget what you have seen or heard, and let No creature know what none but you know yet. There nothing now remaynes to adde unto My tortur'd soule, fresh pangs, save onely that The fact made knowen, she may incurre displeasure; For had I million of lives I'de chuse To loose them one by one rather than have Her finger ake, or she receive a checke. Therefore once more I you conjure by all Your hopes of blisse you let not one word scape Your mouth whereby her honour may be stayn'd. Gar. Well, I'le obey you, but then take you heede To use no further violence on your selfe, For if that Ague-fit returne againe I shall not hold; murder beleeve't will out. Bell. You could not, possibly have found a spell Of equall power with this; for this time Sir You shall prevayle, but what will follow on't 'Tis hard to say, I'm sure my selfe not know. And so Sir, fare you well. Gar. Nay by your leave I will not quit you, till in better tune. It is not fit so great a melancholly Be left alone, for feare of future folly. Finis Acti Secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Scena Prima. The King, Philocres, Lords with Attendants. King. In faith Prince you have mist the bravest sport Perhaps you ever saw. What say you, Lords? Flew not the Hawkes all well? all passing well? Besides the evening was so calme, the game So plentiful, that in good sooth my Lord I'm sorry you did misse your share thereof. Gar. 'Twas pastime fitted for a King, and he Who fayrely by your Majesty invited Forbeare to come did not deserve the sight. Phil. Sir, first, I humbly begge your Highnesse pardon, Then yours, my Lords. The knave my man, who went To fetch my horse, loytred so long till I Thought it had beene too late to overtake you, Besides there past some serious discourse 'Twixt me and Bellamour, in which some houres E're we were well aware on't, slip't away. King. 'Twas well remembered; I doe wonder much I saw not Bellamour all yesternight Nor yet to day, he is not us'd t'absent Himselfe so long away from me; to whom He knowes his company is always wellcome. Saw you him lately, Lords? Lord Garamont You are most inward with him; what's the cause He hath not yet to day appear'd in Court? Gar. Late yesternight so please your Majesty I saw him, not since then, and then he was The saddest man, the most disconsolate I ever saw. King. Sad and disconsolate! Ha! what's the matter? hide it not from me, For by my life I so much love his worth, As I should grieve to see him sad, and if It lyes within my pow're to helpe him, what Soever be the cause of this his griefe, I'ngage mine honour I will see't remoov'd, And him restor'd unto his former health Of minde. Therefore if you do know the cause Speake it in his behalf, that so our Grace May come upon him unexpected. Gar. Sir, I could not learne the cause, do what I could. (Aside) (Pardon me, conscience, if I tell a lye) But with perswasions and meanes I us'd I left him much more quiet than before. King. I'le know it whatsoe'er it be: I know He'll not conceale't from me: who waytes without? Enter Groome. Sirra, you, goe finde out Bellamour his lodging straight, Tell him we greet him well, and much desire His Company, and if he be not busy Bring him along with you, make haste. Groome. I'm gone. Phil. (aside) I thought 'twould be a bitter pille to swallow King. What's that you say, my Lord? Phil. I say perhaps H'as swallowed down some pilles to worke away His melancholly humour. King. I'm resolv'd If he be not in case to come to me I'le goe to him, for I do sit on thornes 'Till I doe know what 'tis that troubles him, And when I know't, then I shall be as much Perplex't till I have eas'd him of his griefe: But see the Messenger's return'd, what newes my friend? How fares our Bellamour? Groome. I know not Sir. King. How's that? you know not Sir, wherefore I pray Were you sent to him? Groome. Sir, he's not within, Nor hath not been in's chamber since the clocke Strucke five. King. Who told thee so, thou nightcrow? say. Groome. His man, so't please my Liege. King. What said he more? How did he rest last night? Groome. Sir, I did aske His man who waytes upon him in his chamber, What was the cause of his so earely rising? His man reply'de he did not rise at all, For he who did not goe to bed Cannot be said to rise. King. How witty all These Rascalls are in tort'ring with delayes; Why went he not to bed? My soul prophetique Foretells some dire event; I am afraid To aske, for feare of hearing some ill newes. Groome. All I could learne, Sir, was that he came in Much later than of usuall, last night, Was very sad, and overheard to say That he would not outlive th'ensuing day, That after having oft'times measur'd out His chambers length with walking o're and o're With armes acrosse and eyes fixt on the ground, As soone as 'twas broad day he left the roome, And follow'd by his man, he beat him backe, Threatning to kill him, if he straight-way not Went to his chamber; charging him to stay 'Till he return'd, which might be should be never. His man though did pursue him with his eye Untill he saw him out o'th'gate, which leades To the Sea-side. Now Sir, you have the whole. King. And in that whole much more than I desire. Lords, hasten after him, pursue with speede, Take every one a severall way, and he Whose lucke it is to bring him backe to me, Shall from my 'Chequer for a boone receive Tenne thousand Duckets, for if he be lost The cause not know'en, never was king so crost. (Exit. Gar. Nay feare not but the cause shall soone be know'en; If ought of ill betide him what a foole Was I so soone to leave him, yet I had His honour plighted hee'd appease himselfe Before I left him, but what will you more? No salve is to be found for such a sore. (Exit. Scena Secunda. Florabella sola. Flo. Pray heavens my troubled thoughts forbode no ill, There's somewhat heere within that pantes and beates And will not suffer me to be in quiet, But I will strive to pacifie my selfe For if I give this humour too much reynes I feele 'twill grow upon me: 'twas a dreame And may it vanish like a dreame, for they Are rather semblances of hopes or feares Caus'd by the daye's preceding fantasies Than signes of truth in ought that is to come; And yet the soule sleepes not, though senses sleepe But rather may be term'd to be the more Awake, by how much it less troubled is By the false formes of sense which then doe sleep. Besides, there sure was somewhat more in it Than dreame; me thinkes I yet see Bellamour When as the other threw his cloake about His eyes, and having hoodwinck't him, to which He freely did give way, (for had I dream'd T'had beene by force, I had sworne t'had been a lye, And not have credited ought else therein.) Me thought he then pluck't out his heart and cring'd, And scrap'd to it, kist it, and hug'd it close, At this me thought, my Bellamour did see Though hoodwinck't, and although his heart was taken From forth his breast and courted by another, Yet he look't on till suddenly he fell, And with the fright to see him fall, I wak't, And found my selfe all in a clammy sweat, Shaking as does the Sea when calmely blow'en on. It addes unto my feares that he hath not As yet to day perform'd his usuall visit, He had not wont to be so long away. Enter Lucina. Luc. What Madame? talking to your selfe alone? May I be happy to partake thereof? Flo. Lucina, heard you me not talke last night? Talke in my sleep I meane. Luc. No truely Madame, (aside) I'de other fish to frye. Flo. I had a dreame; The strangest one er'e heard on. Luc. (aside) I, a vision For sure 'twas more than dreame; there was in mine Realityes, and those so rarely pleasing As if it were or dreame or vision, I would have wish't t'have dream'd out all my life. Flo. It seemes your senses all were busied, Or you must needes have felt me shake. Luc. She might Have gi'n't the other word and not have lyed. Why shake, deare Madame? was your dreame so harsh? So full of terrour? may I know what 'twas? Flo. Alas! I have forgot it; more than that I'm sure 'twas ghastly, full of horror, such As yet I cannot blot out of my minde. Luc. The worse the better; dreames are always read Like Hebrew backwards; good if they be bad Is to be hoped for; bad, if they be good. Therefore pluck up your spirits, what? cast downe For drowsy sleepy fancyes? see, here comes Your women, they missing of you within Enter two Women. Are come to seeke you; how say you pretty ones Is it not so? Fiducia. Yes Madame, we were told Her Grace was walk't forth this way, so we made What haste we could to follow after her. Luc. 'Twas done like careful wenches, now y'are come See what you can invent to cheere your Lady. She's wondrous sad, tell her some merry tales. Nigretta. There's some of us perhaps have greater cause To be chear'd up our selves than she. Promise and fayle! Make me sit up all night! Expect in vayne! But if I not revenge my selfeâ Flo. Who was't? What promis'd? wherein did he fayle? Nig. My Taylor Madame promised to take Measure last night of me for a new gowne Which I must weare on Sunday, and the knave Made me sit up all night, yet never came, So as to boote with losse of expectation I shall not have my gowne made tyme enough For me to weare, and wayte on you to Church. Flo. 'Twas not a mourning gowne he was to make? Nig. A mourning gown? marry the Lord forbid! 'Tis a Carnation sattin gowne, cutt upon white Lay'd o're with silver lace. But Madame, pray What meanes your Grace to talke of mourning gownes? Flo. Perhaps you may have neede of such a one E're then, to wayte on me unto my grave, For sure I have not long to live; I feele A sad benumming chilnesse seize my soule Which does prognosticate my end to be Neerer than you imagine. Fid. Heavens forbid! I never saw her Grace in such a moode, She's wondrous pale; Madame how does your Grace? You looke as if you were not well; perhaps This ayre's too cold; please it your Grace goe in? Nig. Madame, deare Madame, cast not down your selfe With sad imaginations; what can't be That troubles you? make us partakers of it; You know not what unthought of remedyes Lyes sometimes hidden in a woman's breast. Luc. What? not a word? deare Lady speake some comfort, 'Tis more than strange a dreame should cause all this. Flo. What would you have me say? I am posses't With such a sudden seizure of my spirits As that I hardly able am to speake. There's sure some strange thing towards of disaster, Pray let's goe in, and there obey the fates. Fid. Hold her by th'other hand Nigretta: she Needes all our helpes: 'would she were well in bed. The like to this I never heard nor read. Enter Messenger. Nig. What saucy fellowe's this? do you not see The Princesse? that you passe so rudely by Without respect jostling her as you goe. Mess. The Princesse? Is this then Florabella Princesse of Corsica? Nig. Yes marry is't, What foole are you that do not know the Princesse? Mess. 'Tis her I came to seeke. Fid. Sir if you have Any affayres with her y'had best forbeare The making of them know'en till she be better, You see she's not in case to give you hearing. Mess. I must be heard and will; I doe not come To sue for any thing but to performe The last commands of one that's lately dead. Flo. Ha! what's that? dead! stand off, my spirits now Returne, enabling me to undergoe The shocke of what bad newes soe're he brings, Speake on my friend, for I will give you hearing. You spoke of one was dead, say, did you not? Mess. Madame I did, and (with your patience) Must speake it o're again, 'tis the last will And Testament made by a dying man And I th'executor who must see't fulfilled. Flo. Discharge your selfe of that your trust at large Forget not the least circumstance, be sure You doe it faithfully; nought can be worse Than to deceive the trust o'th'dead. Luc. Who e're Saw such strange sudden contrarietyes? She who but now scarce able was to goe Seemes now more vigorous than ever before I have know'en her be, there's some strange businesse in't. Mess. Then Madame to obey both him and you. As I this morning early on my way Was this wayes travelling, I saw a man Standing o'th'top of a high craggy cliffe Which overhangs the Sea: this man saw me, For overthwart the rocke my way did lie, He beck'nÃ©d first, then louder cry'd unto me, As I did ever hope for courtesie In time of neede, that I to him would now Afford my Companie for some small time, This he redoubled often, insomuch As though my businesse did require some haste I therewith did dispense and went to him. When I was got to th'top I might perceive In his pale face death ghastly pourtray'd forth. I hastened my pace: being come nigh He drew his sword, pointed it towards me, Charg'd me to come no neerer, least I would Meete by the way with death; this said, he put This chayne on his sword point. Flo. Ay me! Ay me! Mess. Tos't it from thence to me, gave me in charge To finde out Princesse Florabella, her Whose love he had preferr'd before his life, He bade me give it her from one whom she Sometimes was pleas'd to terme her Bellamour, And tell her that the having seene too much, (Thrice happy he if he had never seene) Caus'd him to this; this said he threw himselfe Backward into the Sea, where I him saw Plung'd under water. (The Princesse sinkes downe. Fid. Helpe, helpe, she is gone. And we for ever miserable. Nig. Rubbe Her temples, pulle her by the nose. Alas! Goe fetch some water, bow her body forwards; What shall we doe? would thou hadst been borne dumb Thou scritch owle. (She reviveth. Fid. Rubbe hard, she comes againe, Madame, deare Madame, Speake and speake comfort. Flo. How can you expect Comfort from her to whom yourselves do use Such Tyranny as to recall a life Tenne times more bitter than tenne thousand deaths. If ever you do covet true content And hope to crowne your wishes with fruition, Be merciful and suffer me to dye: I do conjure you in your Mistrisse name, Her whom you ought t'obey; shew but in this Your due obedience, and for evermore In all things after freely I acquit you. Nig. When she is dead, she'll seeke no further service, There's yet some end prefix't to servitude; But oh! she's gone againe; Fiducia your hand, Lady Lucina yours, let's carry her Into her lodging, put her in her bed, This ayre's too piercing; friend to make amends For what y'have done amisse, haste to the Court, Tell the first gentleman you meete, how that The Princesse Florabell is fallen sicke, And with him send the Doctours to her chamber. Mess. Lady, I will, and truely I am sad To see my message have successe so bad. Scena Tertia. Garamont, Arnaldo, Montalto. Gar. I have sought East as far as Land permits, Inquired in every place, and yet can heare No tidings of him. Arn. Well met Garamont, Heare you yet any newes of Bellamour? Gar. Not I, doe you know any? Arn. Faith nor I, Yet I have sought him Westward to the mountaines, Here comes two more, perhaps they may Have met with him. Montalto, is it you Have wonne the boone? the King's tenne thousand crownes. Mon. No by this hand, not I, yet I have sought As one would seeke a needle 'mongst the rushes. I dare not see the King till he be found. Gar. None of us heare of him, sure he is sunke. But heere comes one, I'le goe inquire of him. Sirâ Enter Messenger. Mess. Sir, by your leave, 'tis I must first be heard, My errand is of greater consequence. Are any of you Courtiers? Gar. Yes all. Mess. Then haste and send Physitians to the Princesse, She is gone sicke to bed. Arn. Gone sicke to bed! What is the cause and how came you to know it? Mess. To answer why, and what and how, I knew it Will be but to repeate that o're againe Which I could wish had beene as yet conceal'd, Besides the repetition may prolong The Princesse succours; therefore pray make haste To send the speediest helpe; soone enough You all may heare what you'll be sorry for. (Exit. Gar. What meanes this bird of midnight? heaven forbid My feares prove true. Arn. Nay I will after too, I know nor what to hope nor feare. Mon. E're long Whate're it be will publickely be know'en, If good, then soone enough, if bad too soone. (Exeunt. Enter Serving Men. 1. Man. What can the matter be my maisters? I n'ere saw a house turn'd topsy turvy so on the sudden; nothing yesterday but tilting and revelling, nothing to day but finger in the eye and lamentable complayning. 2. Man. Why man, they say my yong mistresse, the Lady Florabella, is not well, and can you then blame all the young gallants to hang their heads? Nay, they say the good old King too in sufficiently unsensified. 3. Man. The King out of his wits! the King mad! beare witnesse fellow Roger, if this be not downeright treason, I know not what's what. 2. Man. Why goodman Jobernoll, you'll give me leave to misinterpret my selfe. I mean insenst, and that's a word surpasses your understanding, I wis. 3. Man. Nay, if you speake what I understand not I crave your mercy, Sir, I am sure then I am not guilty of any fault, if any such be therein. 1. Man. For what concerns faults doubtlesly there are enough in us all, therefore never fall out concerning that. I am sure, though some vertue went from me last night, 'twas no vertuous act my neighbour's daughter and I were employed in; she appointed another meeting e're long, but if matters mend not, our daunce by my good will shall be to the tune of Lachrimy, though played on the baggepipe, as well that we may follow the fashion in dauncing to a lamentable tune as also that we may shew some compunction for our late misdemeanour. 3. Man. Nay, soft, fellow Roger, by your leave, I'le taste the sweet, as belike you have done, before I trye the sowre; sweet meate they say, indeede must have sowre sauce. But marke, I pray, the sweet goes before the sowre, the meate before the sauce, not I, I thanke you, I have yet onely had faire promises, and promise is no performance. 2. Man. I would I could but performe as fairely as my lasse fairely promised too, and I would not thinke to be behinde hand with the best of you, but alas! alas! 3. Man. God sends a curst cow short hornes, you would say, would you not? 2. Man. Faith much thereabouts, but they say he's an errant Jade, that can neither wihye nor wagge his tayle, therefore I'le not fayle to meete my mayde Maryon at the great oake at the time appointed. 3. Man. The great oake, marry that is the place my minion appointed to meete me at. 1. Man. The time? (they whisper), good lassies, in faith all's made of the same metall, how they jumpe together in their appointments, hearke you Sirras, and you say the word, let us practise the Catch we learn'd the other day, that we may be ready in it when we meete with our Myrmidonians, and then catch who catch may. (They sing a Catch. Scena Quarta. Garamont, Montalto. Gar. Nay, seeke not to disswade me, you as soone May with your fingers bend the aged oake, Coole Autumn with your breath, or therewithall Enforce the winde back to its hollow cave, As change in me my resolution. Mon. But yet a little patience: doe you heare How she takes on? how she doeth tear her hayre, Wring hands, denye her selfe all nourishment? Save what as drinke she in her teares receives. Thinke you if she were guilty, or had not As dearely loved Bellamour as he Doted on her, she could dissemble thus? Gar. Bugge-beares to cozzen boyes withall; to me All this you say makes her appeare more blacke, More fowly guilty; is there any thing Can bite like to the sting of conscience? And 'tis my comfort in my friend's behalfe, My dead, my too much injur'd friend's behalfe, To see her so tormented. Enter to them King, Arnaldo, Argales, Philocres, with Attendants. King. He was to blame, not for that he aspir'd So high as dare to love my Florabell, But for that He did conceale his love, had he made me Acquainted with it, I should or have had Disswaded him, and strove t'appease his flame With wholesome lenitives, or else have given Her freely to him, for a Gentleman So bred and so well parted as was he Is a fit match for any woman. Phil. Sir, The Gods are just and shape their punishments As men demerit; so have they now quencht Proud Bellamour's too high aspiring flame. Arg. Prince, you may thanke the Gods 'tis as it is, He'd pluck a feather else with you e'faith, Should he but heare this. Arn. What meanes Garamont To struggle so with Lord Montalto? Gar. Most mighty Sir, since what I have to say Must like a pointed dagger pierce your heart, And yet I needes must say it, 'would 'twere said, And I were straightway in my Coffin layd. King. What mighty burden travells he withall? Out with it, Garamont, you had not wont To be so moov'd with trifles; I'm prepar'd Be't what it will to give you patient hearing. Gar. And you had neede of patience, Sir, to heare it, Were't not my friend, my best friend Bellamour That bids me on, bids me go boldly on, To see his injur'd love, his death reveng'd, I'd sooner bite my tongue out than relate So dismall tydings, Sir, as this will prove, But the name, friend, annulls other respects, How many or how great so'ere they be, Therefore, Sir, take it thus, fayre Florabell Hath murdered Bellamour. King. The man sure raves. How could she murder him who drown'd himselfe? Gar. I'le tell you how Sir; 'tis not now unknowe'n That Bellamour lov'd Florabell, and I Though perhaps you not know so much, doe know She seem'd to meete his love with equall fire, But her's was counterfeit, celestiall his. Last night unluckily he light on me, And as I guesse feareing some Treachery, Will'd me to tarry in a certaine place Till he should call; I fearing some mishap Broke his Command and stole up neerer to him, Where many minutes had not past, e're we Might see the Princesse Florabell Appeare on the Balcony, and throw downe A silken ladder, by the which straightway A muffled man climb'd up, and in our sights Did kisse, embrace, enjoy your Florabell. King. Be well advis'd e're you for truth affirme A businesse of this nature; justly poyse The consequences which thereon depend; And suffer not your sorrow so transport you For your friend's losse, as you may thereby runne Hazzard of life your selfe; you know the Law; Recant your rash assertion and in grace I'le attribute it to transcendent passion. Gar. Most mighty Sir, I am not ignorant Of what weight this my accusation is, Nor have I rashly run upon't, before Due consideration had in every point. I first have thought upon the griefe immense It must cause in your Majesty, and then Upon the hatred I shall draw from all Good men and women on my selfe, nor can I blame them for it. I should doe the like To any one were in my case. I know Your daughter's reputation, held for such As had not these eyes seene, and these eares heard What yesternight I did both heare and see, And did not as effect thereof ensue My dearest friend's untimely end, I should Have beene the first would have return'd the lye Downe the appearing slaunderer's throate. I know The Law likewise; which doomes to death what mayde Soe're she be, that is accus'd t'have lost Her honour, forfeited her name By knowledge of a man, before 'twixt him And her the hymenean rights have past: Unlesse some one will undertake her quarrell And with his sword in hand e're three dayes passe Maintayne th'accused virgin's honour 'gainst Th'accuser, which if he doe overcome The virgin's set at liberty, and he That did accuse her justly undergoes What punishment the law would inflict on her; But if the undertaker loose the day Whereby 'tis judg'd th'accuser was i'th'right The virgin suffers: All this I know, And Sir, beleeve me, and you Gentlemen, Whose angry lookes with patience I sustayne, I'm no less griev'd than you; no lesse incenst Than you, or any of you 'gainst my selfe, But should I not performe this latest duty To my dead friend, I'm 'fraid his ghost would finde No resting place, whilst I, who know the Cause Of his disaster seeke not to appease His wounded soule with coveted revenge. 'Tis therefore Sir (your pardon humbly begg'd As your's Lords all for this my sad assertion) That heere I offer to maintaine 'gainst all The world that Florabella's false, And for the prostitution she hath made Of her fayre body to the fowler touch Of man, is by the Lawes ordayn'd to death. King. I cannot on the sudden call to minde Any so haynous sinne by me committed, as might deserve This height of punishment; but sure the Gods Are just; to doubt the contrary were to Provoke them to more dire revenge; and yet I cannot guesse what more of horrour Can me betide. But cease, such talke as this Full ill becomes a Prince's mouth. Surely they know both what my crime hath beene Which merited this lash of theirs, and how Yet more to humble me, if I not take This their correction calmely: I have drunke Deepe of their mercyes, tasted more of them Than many others, for I ne're till now Saw fortune pourtraited with knitted browes: Than unaccustom'd to such frownes as this, Pardon these teares; these obsequies perform'd To thy dead name my Florabella, now Let's take such speedy order as we may For the performance of the Lawes decrees. Arnaldo, see straight proclamation made How that my daughter is accus'd, of what, By whom, and what she is to undergoe If none in three dayes space her cause maintaine Against th'accuser, and by vanquishing Of him, acquit her of the death, which else She is to suffer. Arn. I'le forthwith see your Majestye's command In execution put, but I had rather Have shew'd my forwardnesse, my will to serve you In ought by thought can be conceiv'd, than this. Phil. Be not too much caste downe, most mighty Sir, I'le pawne my life the Lady's innocent Of once committing such a thing in thought, And Garamont's a fowle-mouth'd slanderer. Gar. Prince, if you please by hazzard of that life You'll pawne, to prove me so, the question soone Will be decided, but if (as much I doubt) Your acting correspond not with your words I shall make bold to say y'are a paultry Prince. Phil. I should be loath to put so fowle disgrace Upon this nation, unto which I am So vow'd a vassall, as to undertake (Being a stranger) that, which should I doe, Would much redound to all our nation's shame. Arn. How discreete He's in his apologies, pockes upon him; O that the fates had pleas'd have dish't in him For food for Haddockes 'stead of Bellamour! The King is wondrous sad, nor can I blame him, It is an humour they which feede upon Will hardly e're be satisfide with, it needes No sawse for shoing horne to draw it on; And therefore best withstand its first assaults. Sir, pardon, if I interrupt your serious thoughts, And take the boldnesse on me to advise Your Majesty not suffer sadnesse seize Too much your soule; the Gods afflict not thus But where they love; and surely if you take This their correction calmely as you ought Their hand's not short'ned; they will multiply Blessings equivalent. King. How different a thing it is to give Counsell, and take it. This playster, Patience Is no fit salve for all sores, mine alas! Is of a more contagious sort, the part is gangren'd, Corrosives or sword to cut it off, Not lenitives must be apply'd; she is my childe, Thinke but on that, my friend. Mont. Sir, we are all your children, you Father unto us all, Rex pater patriÃ¦, Your kingdomes wellfare doth depend on your's. Suffer not then that we your Subjects all, Your loyall Subjects, by the bad events Which may ensue on this your melancholly, Prove Orphans. King. Though Kings pay their debt to heaven The people seldome want a father long. Mont. O Sir, but many Ages may passe o're, e're we Having lost you (which God prohibit) be Blest with the like. But Sir, methinkes it would Better become your Majesty to doe, than thinke; Rowse up your spirits Sir, and let us all Consult by what blest meanes We may your daughter free from Calumny. Be pleas'd goe in, and have your Counsell summon'd, Many eyes see more than one. King. I thanke you for Your wholesome Counsell, which I thus obey. (Exeunt.</field>

You never heare her storme nor curse, as I By this good light should doe, were her case mine; She onely weepes the losse of Bellamour, Not mentioning what she her selfe's to loose, Her life; and what she hath already lost, Her reputation; but gladded seemes She shall so soone i'th'other world meete with him, Where whatsoe're the world shall heere thinke of her, Or he have thought whilst here deluded; he Meeting her there, shall know her spotlesse soule, Which that it might the sooner meete with his Did e're her noontyde d'off her clayye garments. Fid. If there remayne one ounce of worth in mankind So early she will not disrobbe herselfe. And were I not assur'd that yet some sparkes Of fire from heaven descended, did remayne Within our Corsick's breast (which if there be Any such heate divine 'twill now breath forth, And burne to ashes that base slaunderer Whose venemous tongue durst goe about to blast Our Mistrisse' honour) I say did I not rest Secure of this I once would weare the breeches And not despayre, but woman as I am, Make him doe penance for so fowle a lye.

Mess. Having once summon'd you, my errand's done. Fid. What e're the matter is we had best t'obey. (Exeunt. Scena Secunda. Philocres, Lucina. Luc. What say you now my Princely Paramour? Was it not true I told you? Finde you not Some difference 'twixt longing all in vaine After a beauty, and enjoying one, Though perhaps altogether not so fayre? Phil. I doe my deare Instructresse, I now finde Sighes are not as they seeme refreshing blasts To a scorch't heart; but like tempestuous windes They blow the fire, and make the heate farre greater, Whilst only they enjoy the comfort of A nourishing heate, who doe without Or cost of sigh, or losse of teare possesse A mutuall love, such as doe you and I. But pray thee say, how does the Princesse beare This her discovery, for 'tis certaine truth. Luc. Now by my soule Sir, I dare sweare 'tis false. Nay I doe know it false, and so may you, If you remember that same very night, Wherein she stands accus'd to have been t'ane napping You were her Guardian; it was you that watch't I'th'out roome, and kept her chamber doore, None could passe in Sir, but by your connivance, And sure you will not prove your selfe a Pandar. Phil. The calling backe to minde that night, Makes me misdoubt there may be some mistake In Florabella's businesse, sure 'twas so. A pockes upon my pate, where were my braynes? I did not light on it before. Luc. What is't That troubles you, my Lord? Phil. No, nor you neither You could not thinke upon't. Luc. Not thinke on what? Phil. For certaine Garamont saw you and me Our first encounters make that very night, And so mistooke you for the Princesse. Luc. O me unfortunate! 'tis most apparent, Shall I then prove the cause of all her sorrow? And which is worse, not able be to give The least redresse. Phil. Appease thy selfe my love, All this may make for thee. Luc. But you Sir may Salve all, and make amends for that wherein You have unwittingly offended. Phil. What meanes my fayre Lucina? Luc. I know I shall not neede use Arguments Of provocation; your honour does Ingage you to't. Phil. To what my dearest love? Luc. To make you undertake the Princesse cause, And her defend against Lord Garamont, Since you must now needes know her innocent, And you your selfe the originall of what Of mischiefe can betide her. Phil. Pardon me, It not becomes a Prince hazzard his person In other folke's affayres: Did I her love As whilome e're I tasted of thy sweetes Much might be done: but since the love I bore To her is vanish't, and fix't heere with thee, No fighting I, I doe love thee too well To hazzard that of blisse the fates intend thee. Luc. There's nought of good can me befall, if ought Of bad befall her. Phil. You may be mistak'n, I spake it knowingly, if you your selfe Stand not in your own light you shall not neede Envy the Princesse, you shall be as great, As puissant a Princesse as is shee. Luc. Mocke not, my Lord, the humblest of your vassalls. Phil. Not to detayne you on the Tenter hookes, Since we have both, though unaware, been guilty Of Florabell's misfortune; our abode Heere may be dangerous. The King and Counsell Neglect no meanes of sifting out the truth, Which should they finde, what would become of you? My birth would beare out such an amorous slip, Dangers foreseene are easily prevented, Therefore to shunne all sinister event, I'le take my leave o'th'King this very day. Luc. But wherein, I pray, am I the safer? Phil. Thinke you that I'le leave you behinde, my fayre one? No, sure, we will in fortune share alike. Luc. I goe along with you? what will the King Your father say? what will the people thinke To see you bring a woman over with you? 'Twill hardly suffer good construction, And trust me, Sir, I value more mine honour Than to be a know'en concubine to e're A Prince alive. Phil. You injure me in these Your doubts; to witnesse which no sooner you Shall set your foot within Majorca But I will marry you, make you my wife, And hereupon I plight to you my faith. Luc. Sir, since y'are pleas'd thus unexpectedly, (For I durst never ayme at such a blisse) To honour me with th'title of your wife, I'le strive to bring in stead of portion And correspondent birth to yours, obedience. Phil. And that's more worth than millions are without it. Therefore my heart, least we may be prevented Make haste; and if you have or jewells Or ought you value else, see't soone pack't up. About an hour hence I will send a couple Of trusty servants to you, who shall wayte Upon you, and conduct you safe aboard My Gally, which lyes ready in the Haven; I'le meane time kisse the King's hands, faigne t'have had Some sudden summons which doeth call me home. Then put on wings to follow thee, my deare. Luc. Was ever Prince so truly generous? Phil. Not to be so were to be worse than beast. Luc. Sir, you are all compos'd of worth, I dare Not doubt your word, and therefore thus obey you. The Gods are just, and doubtlesse will not suffer The Princesse thus injuriously to suffer. (Exit. Phil. So, thus far all goes well; should she not be Convey'd away, or rather made away Er'e her examination be taken Who knowes but she for want of good take heede Might somewhat say that might give light unto The businesse, so all be discover'd. Thus it behooves to mine and countermine If men their ends will compasse; I will Marry her if ever she set her foot Within my Countrey. I am bound by oath Which I will keepe, to doe so: But if she Never come there, then I'm at liberty, And if she ever doe my skill shall fayle me. Who waytes without there? ho, Francisco. Enter Francisco. Fran. Sir, What is your pleasure? Phil. Where's your fellow Ponto? Fran. I left him, Sir, sharpning his dagger's pointe. Phil. Goe, call him hither. (Exit Francisco. Heere's a payre of Rascalls, Will for a brace of crownes not stick to cut Their mother's throate, and for a couple more Make the deede good, and sweare she was a whore. Enter Francisco and Ponto. Come hether foreward Franck, and trusty Ponto You'll sticke at nothing I command you doe? Pont. Sir, does there breathe that man you'd fain see dead? Fran. Is it a Virgin you would have defam'd? Pont. A voteresse you would have strumpeted? Fran. Some holy man accus'd of heresy? Pont. Some altar robb'd of all its ornaments? Fran. What is't you'd have us doe? speake but the word. 'Tis done. Phil. None of all these my trusty blades. Hearke in your eare; (they whisper) and for your reward Take all the gold and jewells are about her. Pont. Is this all Sir? I'm sorry your commands Are of no higher nature; as for this Beleeve it done already. Phil. I neede not sweare You unto secrecy. Fran. Faith Sir, doe if you please For 'tis all one whether you doe or no. Were not our lives concern'd 'tis not an oath Would weigh thus much with either of us both. Phil. I love those that tell truth. Pont. You'll n'ere love us then. Phil. Well, well, be gone about your businesse. Both. W'are gone, Sir. (Exeunt both. Phil. Things thus must he contrive Who in this world does meane to thrive. The Politicke wise not valiant stout Is he who brings his ends about. Scena Tertia. Fiducia, Nigretta. Fid. I pray thee wench, what questions ask't they you? I never was so Catechiz'd before. Nig. More than a good many, that I'm sure. They ask't what a clocke it was when as My Lady came into her chamber? who came with her? What time she went to bed? who lock't the doores? Who lay with her that night? whether that I Saw her in bed or no? what time she rose? Whether I found her cloathes lay'd i'th'same place Next morning, as when she put them off? And twenty more such frivolous questions, which I not remember. Fid. Such like questions just They ask't of me; but pray thee, say What didst thou answer to their last demaund? For I remember when I came i'th'morning Into her chamber, I might see her gowne, Her knots, her petticoates, and all she wore The day before, remov'd from where they were When we put her to bed, which made me wonder. Nig. I, I remember how they lay, when we Came in, as if put off in haste, disorderly, And not as we did leave them. Fid. Well, How didst thou answere that interrogatory? Nig. At first I answer'd nothing, but stood mute, At which their Lordships' startling, swore I'de best Tell trueth, the naked bare fac't trueth, Or they by tortures would compell it from me. I did obey their wisedomes; did confesse I found her cloathes misplac't; at which they all Heaving their shoulders up into their neckes, And looking fixtly one upon another, As if the case were evident, bade me Be gone, for I had said too much, if true. Fid. I cannot blame them; if they do misdoubt The argument is shrewd, yet I dare pawne My soule she's innocent. Nig. I cannot tell I'le lay no wagers; though she be a Lady She is compos'd of the same flesh as we Her servants are: Besides, if you remember The Balconye-window in the outward roome Was open in the morning, and I'm sure I saw it bolted e're she went to bed. Fid. Somewhat there must be in't; why doe they not Question Lucina; she that lay with her, She's likelyest to know of all that is past, And to say trueth, I rather doe misdoubt Her, than the Princesse; nay, I'le rather doubt My selfe, and thinke I might walke in my sleepe, Or you, or to say trueth, all woman kinde. Her passion for her Bellamour is such, As had I seene what Garamont affirms He saw, I should beleeve I'de seene amisse, For certainely such demonstrations Of griefe, cannot be counterfeitt. Nig. Nay, certainly I doe beleeve she did Love Bellamour, but will not sweare but she Might love some other too. Full ill advis'd Is she who suffereth her selfe to be So ill provided of servants as to have One onely sweetheart; so foolish certainly Will ne're Nigretta be. Fid. What meanes the wench? I'm sure thou doest not speake as thou doest thinke. Nig. Yes in good faith, and so should you thinke too Would you thinke wisely. Take it on my word Who have past some more yeares i'th'Court than you. The wisest and the fayrest thus doe doe In Courts and Cityes, thus the Ladyes live. To shake a lover off 'mongst them is sinne And foolishnesse accounted; and what one's Not able to performe many may doe. Some one may be convenient to send Of errands; if his Mistresse bid him see What Ladyes are i'th'privy lodgings; whether The Princesse stirre abroad or no, or but Enquire at the backe stayres what colour'd gowne Her Grace puts on to day, what knots, What fashion'd ruffe: he lowly cringes, Kisses her glove, professes how much he's Her humble servant, how much honoured By this employment, so forthwith is gone. Another may be good to laugh at, to Make sport withall, or to remoove the spleene; This man though laugh'd at ne're so loudly, ne're So palpably, takes all in excellent part, And does professe him selfe the happiest man Alive, in that he makes her Honour merry. Others there be compos'd of mettle more Refin'd, may serve for Cabinet Counsellours, For bosome friends, and when they're once got thither, They will not sticke to stray a little lower. Fid. Sure you do force your selfe to talke all this Onely to trye what mettle I am made on, But it is more than needes, I never yet Knew other love than to my Mistrisse service, And should fond hayre-brayn'd love e're get Dominion over me he ne're should boast Of more than one shaft which could wound my heart; And she indeede that wounded is with more, Was never hurt at all, nor ever knew What did belong to faith or constancy. Nig. I hate this love's Philosophy. What's this That you call faith? what tearme you constancy? They're onely meere imaginary names To cozzen fooles and babes withall. Faith in a woman (if such faith there be In any woman, whereof I must needes Professe my selfe totally ignorant) It is no goodnesse, no, nor vertue is it, But meere necessity of love, A woeful badge of faded beauty, which Likes onely one, because no more like her. The Lawes of love which practis'd are by all Your wisest Ladyes, most experienc't Dames, Is to have many sweet hearts, but make use Onely of one at once, and often change. Fid. Well, I shall ne're be saved by your beliefe; Therefore leave this discourse, or talke alone, And that I may reduce you to the point From whence you have runne ryott: I pray y', say What may the cause be why Lucina is Not yet examin'd, when 'tis likelyest If any body doe know anything Concerning this affayre, it must be shee. Nig. I heard Philocres, and his friend Feredo Were by the Counsell pray'd to question her, But I beleeve their wisdomes may have err'd In having made no better choice. I know Whereto the Prince's questions all doe tend. Fid. Why? hath he ever question'd you, Nigretta? Nig. Yes, and had had his answere too, but that I not presume to be my Mistresse' taster. Fid. I perceive you'll to th'old Theame againe, Therefore I'le in least that the Princesse may Lacke anything. I fear we may have stay'd Too long already. Nig. I'le in with you too. Scena Quarta. Montalto, Arnaldo, Feredo. Mon. Could you learne ought, Feredo, of Lucina, Which might give light unto this deede of darknesse? All our enquiries of the other wenches Have beene but so much time spent to no purpose. Fer. Your Lordships know that when I was commanded To take Lucina'es examination The Prince desired he might have leave To goe along with me, which being graunted, We left your Lordships and we forthwith went To finde her out, and as we crost the Court The Gates being open, we might see i'th'parke Some halfe a dozzen set of fayre Coach-horses Brought thither to be seene and solde, if any Tooke liking to them. The Prince not thinking that our errand Requir'd so much haste, was much desirous To looke upon the Steedes, for that he said He was to buy some. I reply'de I'de wayte upon his Highnesse as soone as I had dispatch't what I was sent about, But he alleadging that the best might be Perhaps bought off e're I had done With questioning Lucina, was so earnest In his desires, as I for to obey him Went along with him. He perused each horse Apart, then coupled them together To see how they would match; and faults he found In most or all of them; some's colours pleas'd him not, And those whose colours pleas'd, he did not like Their shape; there was but one amongst them all Which he found not somewhat to say unto, And that indeede I must confesse Was such a one, as were it to be match't With five such other, the mightyest Prince alive Might be proud to be draw'en by them, His colour bay, but his extremities, As feete, tayle, maine, coale-blacke save that His neere hinde-foot was white, his head Was small, a starre he in his forehead had. His eares were short and piked, his eyes large And quicke, his nostrills still extended, His mouth still foaming, and perpetually Cranshing his bitt, his necke short and lofty, His breast broad, his backe not overlong, And with a blacke list gutter'd to the docke, His buttockes large, and full of brawny flesh. His legges were cleane and sinewye, the one Of which he still kept pawing, His foot was somewhat high, and his hoofe hard. Some houres or better we did spend in this Perusing of those horses; which being done We tooke our way towards Lucina'es chamber, We found the chamber doore lock't, first we knock't Softly, then louder, lastly very loud, But had no answere made; we said we came Sent by the King; all would not doe, we could Have no replye; we angry grew, at last We broke the doore, but found not her, We then sought for her over all the Court, But could not heare of her; at last we went To the Court-gates to know whether or no She was gone forth; where we did heare that she Some houres before wayted on by two men Had passed through the Gate. We by inquiry trace't her, till we found She was gone out o'th'towne; we there left watch To bring us word when she return'd, but yet We have no news of her, and sure 'tis now So late the City Gates are lock't, so as I feare I shall not light on her this night. Arn. No, nor to morrow neither, I beleeve. Trust me, you were to blame for loytering When sent about a businesse of this weight. She sure knew all, and fearing least it might Be wrought out of her, she hath left the Court. Fer. I doe confesse my fault, my Lords, but had Either of you beene in my place, and so Importun'd as was I, I doe beleave You would have done as I did; God he knowes I dream'd of nothing lesse than her escape. Mont. Knowes the King of it yet? Fer. He does my Lord, And is so much incens't (for he till now Did never doubt his daughter's innocence) As giving it for graunted, she's in fault, Has vow'd never to see her face till she Hath clear'd herself: or for not doing so Have suffer'd death. Her cloaths mislayd, and that The window was left open, doe worke much On his beliefe. Arn. I, that balcony window Stickes in my stomach too. Nigretta did depose 'Twas boulted when she went to bed, and sure There must goe hands to th'opening of it. Mont. Besides Lord Garamont is knowe'n to be Of so unquestion'd a reputation, So prone too to defend (as all men ought, All men of worth I meane) a Ladye's honour Rather than rayse false calumnyes, which may Sully their names, as that's surely, I thinke The cause why none appeares in her defense. Arn. I know not what to say, but I could wish The Law were wink't at: for if things proceede As yet they doe our wives and daughters too May chance hop't headlesse; love's Bred within us, and as we increase in yeares And strength, so it increases, nature's selfe Doeth graft it in our hearts; and where it once Gets footing, heaven and earth obey. Mont. 'Tis true Arnaldo, and I oft have thought The Law in this point to be too severe, For if so sweete it be to sinne, and not To sinne so necessary, or nature is Imperfect, which oppugnes the Lawes, or else The Law's too hard which does contend 'gainst nature. Enter Argales. Arg. The King, my Lords, doeth greete you well and doeth By these his letters Patent, constitute You Lord Montalto, Lord high Constable And you Lord Marshall, for he is resolved To have no Ceremoniall part omitted, But all things punctually perform'd, as doe The Lawes require. Mont. How fares his Majesty? Arg. Sad, you will well beleeve, and yet beleeve me He beares it bravely, faith, they not deserve To rule by Lawes that will not be rul'd by them. Arn. His patient bearing this so sad disaster Crownes all his other deedes of memory. Will he himselfe be present? Arg. No, my Lord, But if his daughter be not clear'd by some To him yet unknowe'n way, he vowes the Law Shall passe upon her. Arn. Faith, I faine would hope, But know not what. Mont. Who knowes, when man's most weake The Gods are strongest, and the heavens inspire The man that hopeth well with heavenly fire. Scena Quinta. Sylvander, Bellamour in disguise. Syl. I have rid all night, and never met with man Nor house, nor seene so much as candlelight, Nor heard a dogge barke; this for certaine is Terra Incognita; now that the day Begins to cleare, I certainely shall meete With some or other who will able be To tell me where I am, and luckily See yonder walkes a man, Sir by your leaveâ Bell. Sir, good leave have you. Syl. Nay, friend, more than so, We must not part thus; I have lost my way, Or, to say true, I thinke I ne're was in't: Heere I have travell'd in these unpath'd woods All night, and doe not love to wander Thus all alone, as by your melancholly It seemes you love to do, therefore pray, say, What Towne w'are neerest to, and which way leads unto it? Bell. You could not, Sir, have met with one lesse able T'instruct you than you have done. I know not where We are, nor what this place is call'd, Yet can I not say I have lost my way, For all wayes are alike to me; only I love Those best where I may be most private, Therefore that I may love this, as I did Till I encountred you, pray leave me. Syl. Sir, you shall pardon me, my horse and I Are well nigh famish't; I have left him tyed To grasse this morning by an oake, remarkable For its broad spreading boughes, whilst I perchance Might light upon some passenger. The Sunne hath made his journey 'bout the world And visited each Cranye of the Universe Since he or I did taste of any food. Bell. Since heerein to[o] your hudwinck't fortune hath Cast you unluckily on me; 'tis twice As long, since I or ate or dranke; And yet I lye, I have had my belly full Of water; but alas! all would not serve To ease me of this irksome life, wherewith Some day or two I must be longer yet Annoy'd. Syl. You cannot then direct me in The way that leades to the next Towne? Bell. No, Sir. Syl. Then farewell. I must finde out some that can. (Exit. Bell. O bitter sweetes of love! Farre better 'tis Never to have knowe'n you, than once knowe'n to loose you! How happy a condition would it be To be in love, if the delights once tasted Were never to be lost againe; or if When they are lost, with them their memory Did likewise vanish; so should I not now Call backe to mind fayre Florabella's favours Wherewith she pleas'd to mocke me, nor grieve for Their losse. But truce a while With passion, since the fates have not decreed That I should drowne, for if't had been their will The fisher boate would not have beene so nigh To save me when I plung'd into the deepe. I will a while survive, and I'le returne Backe to the Court to heare whether or no The Princesse doeth bewayle my death, and see What doeth become of her. In this disguise Sure none will know me; somewhat I'd fayne doe If I knew what, e're to the other world I made my passage, whereby to make knowe'n To all the world, and to her selfe in chiefe, How I might well have merited her love Had she so pleas'd, better perhaps than he Who e're he be that did and does enjoy her. When this, I know not what, is done, I'le dye In peace and quiet; but the lowly valleys, The hills, these woods which I have taught so oft To echo backe her name, shall make my moanes Knowe'n to all passengers; fountains shall weepe For me, the windes shall sigh, and in Their loudest blasts make all my sufferings knowe'n. (Exit. Enter Lucina, Francisco, Ponto. Luc. Whether doe you dragge me thus? How long will't be E're you performe your Maister's will? y'are yet More cruel than is he; he but commanded My being put to death once, you your selves Confesse, and your unheard of tyranny Hath caus'd me dye as oft as houres have past, Since yesterday you tooke me from my chamber. I oft have heard and now doe finde it true The feare of death is worse than death it selfe, Therefore be mercifull, and end my miseryes. Pont. You may thanke him for your so long delay; You had beene dead, and cold else long e're this, But now prepare to dye. Fran. Prepare to live. Since fayre meanes all this while cannot prevayle I'le now use this (He draweth). 'Tis thou not she must dye, Or else release up all thy interest In her and what is hers freely to me, So thou mayst still live poore and we in plenty. Pont. So thou shalt first be hang'd and she be damn'd. (He wounds Lucina and fights with Francisco. Luc. I thanke thee more for this than him for what Of good he did intend me. Better I finde It is to dye than live with tortur'd minde. Enter Sylvander. Syl. 'Twas swords which I heard clash, see where they are: Or sheath your swords or I will make the third (Francisco and Ponto runne away. What? both so nimble? sure their cause was bad, They would not else so soone have left the field. What meanes that gentlewoman which lyes there? See, see, she bleedes apace. How fares it with you? Say, lady, speake, your murderers are fled, Be of good comfort, 'tis a friend speakes to you. Luc. Be then a friend, and suffer me to dye. Syl. No, by your leave, faire Dam'sell, not unlesse My old friend fayle me heere, and he's not wont To sticke at trifles, many a sorer wound (He draweth out a boxe of balsame.) Than this, I hope, will prove, I oft have cured With this my balsome, which I carry still About me for like accidents as this That happen sometimes in an houre, Which will not chance againe in a man's age; I'de not have beene without it at this time For more than I will speak of. Loe, The bloud is stay'd already, be of comfort. Stand up my wench, and e're you tell the story Of your disaster, say how hight these woods, And how we may get out of them. Luc. Sir, your lookes Speakes you a Gentleman; and for your charity Us'd towards me you ought to be obey'd. These woods are call'd The Forrest of Disaster: Not farre from hence there lyes a way which leades Into the beaten rode. Syl. The forrest of Disaster! You well may call it so, had not my starres, My better fate directed me this way It might have prov'd disasterous to you, But I thanke destiny. Lady, be pleas'd To come along with me. I have a horse Not farre from heere will serve to beare us both. I will not leave you till in better hands Than those I tooke you from; you by the way May, if you please, relate your story to me, And wherein I may serve you may command. Luc. Who would command must first learn to obey. So I doe you Sir: that way lyes the way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Scena Prima. Three Women, three Men. 1. Man. My friends, it is no laughing matter, nor ought we be in our jollitye when our good King and all the Court are so afflicted, and yet I am of your opinion too that we ought to keepe our appointment, our Rendezvous, for else the maydes would not take our words another time, and therefore am I come hither along with you, onely to desire them to have us excused for this time, and promise to make amends another day. 2. Man. I cannot gaynesay anything you have said, for you are the greater clerke of the two. But yet methinkes it is pitty to deceive the poore silly-soules, and see where like honest wenches they stand expecting us. 3. Man. I would it might have stood with the good liking of the higher powers, our Lords and Counsellours, to have put off this sad businesse till some other day, my mouth waters to have one friske for all this. 1. Man. There will be no feare of your miscarrying, though you loose your longing. Well met, fayre maydes, I see you are women of your words, and to the end we might appeare as true as you, we are come, though onely to make our appearance and bid you farewell. 1. Wom. How so sir, I pray? what may the matter be that hath thus marred our intended mirth. 1. Man. The matter is shortly this, This is not a day for revelling. The Princesse Florabella is this day to loose her head. 2. Wom. Her head! Marry God forefend: I hope you doe but mocke. 2. Man. He tells you true. 2. Wom. For what, I pray? 2. Man. For that, which had you all your dues, I am afraid your's would not sit long upon your shoulders: for loosing of her mayden-head. 3. Wom. Why then, that head's lost already. Come, I see they do but jeast with us, strike up, and let us loose no time. 1. Man. Beleeve me, we are in too good earnest, and therefore, by your leave, no dauncing this day, but fayrely fare you well. 3. Wom. Nay then by your leave Sir, we will not part so. I'le see some thing surely for my comming abroad. I'le goe along and see what passes. 2. Wom. My heart will never give me to looke on so pittious a spectacle. A Princesse loose her head for such a trifle. Mine stands fast yet, and therefore I'le believe her's may do so too, and in that hope I'le goe along. 3. Wom. You'll not breake company, Madge, will you? 1. Wom. I'le goe, if it be but to curse the peeching rascall that accuseth her. 1. Man. On these tearmes we shall not breake company. W'ell wayte upon you to the Towne, and do you the best service we can in placing of you. Omnes. We thanke your worship heartily. Scena Secunda. Montalto, Arnaldo, with Attendants. Mont. 'Tis much, none yet appeares will undertake The Princesses defence: had not the King Impos'd this place on me, and therewithall An incapability of serving her As Champion; I'le take Heaven to witnesse If none should take her cause in hand, I Would have had beene the man my selfe. Arn. I thinke it fitter farre She suffer, who through unrelenting doeth Cause matchlesse paynes within her servant's breast Then she, whose yielding breathes new life into him. If the same heate, the very same desire Doe egge both sexes on to taste those sweetes Of love, which to the ruder vulgar seeme Faults punishable; why should women be Blam'd for committing that with one or more, Which men commit and recommit each houre, And are the most esteem'd, not punish'd; trueth to say The Lawes unequall ought be abrogated: But though our offices exempt us, there are enough Yong lads i'th'towne; me thinkes some halfe a thousand Should strive for th'honour of the undertaking, And if none doe then may my wish prevayle That none betwixt nineteen and fourty nine May ever have commotion beneath the girdle. Mont. All this is but discourse. The time's at hand, Therefore let us provide all things be ready, That come or come they not, we be not found Faulty in executing of our dutyes. Who waytes without there? Enter three Servants. 1. Man. What's your pleasure Sir? Mont. Are all things ready? Is the scaffold up? Are things within the lists ordered as You had command? 1. Man. All straightwayes will be done. Mont. It were then best my Lord that you and I Went to acquaint all parties wh'are concern'd That they prepare themselves, for th'houre drawes nigh. (Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Three Serving Men. 1. Man. Come then, my friends, let's to our businesse, though I must confesse I never went about any in my life with so ill a will; but they that are bound must obey. 2. Man. Would I were bound for the furthest part of the earth, so I were not bound for this voyage. D's lud, that I were but a Gentleman for his sake, I'de teach his Lordship, as goodly as he is, to peech, with a pockes to him. 1. Man. Were you with the Carpenter? is the Scaffold finish't, and all things in a readinesse belonging thereunto? 3. Man. 'Twas e'ne as good as done three houres agoe, 'tis surely done by this. I'le goe and see, and if it be ready I'le bring you word presently. 1. Man. Pray thee doe, and see you loyter not by the way, for they say 'tis as good to have one's head off as ever aking, and in my conscience the sweet Princesses head is not well at ease at this time. Know you that Gentleman that walkes so (Enter Bellamour disguis'd.) melancholly yonder, he hath somewhat surely in his pate we know not of. 2. Man. I never saw him before, he is sure some stranger. I am sure he belongs not to the Court; who knowes but having heard of the Princesse her accusation, he may be come to shame all the Gentry of Corsica, and take her defense upon him. 1. Man. O that that were true! but what's the haste with thee? why com'st thou so soon backe? thou can'st not have beene there, and heere again so soone. 3. Man. Let me take breath before I speake, and in the meantime take you courage and comfort. I am so glad! 2. Man. Of what? man. If there be any cause of gladnesse, pray thee let us share with thee in it; any thing belonging to joy never could come in a more needful time. 1. Man. Speake then, and hold us not upon the racke of expectation. 3. Man. As I was going to the Carpenter about the businesse you wot of, I met a pretty little Gentleman, who ask't me if none had yet undertaken the Lady Florabella's defense? I told him no, and that if they came not the sooner, 'twould be too late, for within less than an houre, as she had lost her mayden-head, she was likely to loose woman's-head. He said, I lyed like a paultry knave, for neither had she lost the one, neither should she loose the other, for he was come to prove Lord Garamont a lyer. Bell. What's that my friend? pray say it o're againe. 3. Man. Nothing Sir, but that there is one come who will defend the Lady Florabella's cause against Lord Garamont. Bell. That must not be. 1. Man. Why so Sir, I pray? if you doe no good, I hope you will do no harme. Bell. No surely friend, but all the good I can To the fayre Princessse falsely slaundered. And to that purpose I my selfe am come To be her champion. I nor must, nor will Permit another robbe me of that glory. 1. Man. Nay then Sir, I crave you mercy: so her cause be defended I doe not care by whom. 3. Man. Marry, but this is the likelyer Gentleman to make it good, he hath something of strength and bones in him. The other I tell you is a very little timber'd Gentleman, and I am afraid will not be able to hold out against Lord Garamont, therefore this for my money. Bell. Pray which way went that other Gentleman? 3. Man. Straight towards the Court, as I conceived. Bell. Then pray, friend, let me begge your company, To go alone with me to the Court, And let the Lords appointed to see The this daye's business performed, know That there another combattant is come Who first desires the combat. 3. Man. With all my heart Sir, and I thanke you too, heartily. I'le wayte upon your worship, and hope for some reward for my good newes. (Exeunt Bellamour and the third Man. Manent the first and second Man. 1. Man. Whye, so then, this is somewhat, better late than never, goe get you gone, and bring the women hither presently. 2. Man. I'm gone. 1. Man. I pray God, the Ladye's defense fall to the share of this Gentlemen that was heere. I like his aspect wondrous well, me thinkes he promiseth victory; and yet who can tell; your little men are all fire, they have no drosse in them, they are true mettle from head to heele. Well, I will hope the best. See here comes Hodge, with his leash of Conyes. Well say'd Hodge; Thou hast made haste indeede. Not a word, but stand close there. Enter Feredo, with people bringing in the Scaffold. Fer. So, well said, my friends, bring in the Scaffold, And set it up there on that side: Make ready on that other side the place Appointed for the challanger, And see all things be in a readinesse. Set up the chayre for the Lord Constable And Lord high Chamberlaine. The King will not For all this possibility of freedom to His daughter be persuaded to looke on. H'as made a vow never to see her face Till she or be acquitted or be dead, And she on her part too hath made a vow That 'till or dead or freed from what is laid Unto her charge, no man shall see her face, And to that purpose she hath leave obtayn'd To appeare vayl'd; and to say trueth't had beene Much misbecomming otherwise t'have done. Her vayle may hide the blush, which certainely Guilty or not will have recourse unto Her cheekes, and yet who knowes? perhaps A looke from her might have put life and strength Into her Champion. So now all is well, And see, the Lords doe come. Scena Quarta. Montalto, Arnaldo, with Attendants who take their places, Philochres. Mont. All is well marshall'd, thankes to you Feredo. There now remaynes nothing to be done But that the parties interess'd be call'd, And pray'rs be made to heaven for just successe, Which from my heart I zealously do begge. Arn. And so do I. Omnes. So do we all, my Lords. Arn. I thinke 'twere best, my Lords, we sent Feredo To bring the Princesse in and place her first, Shee'll have the longer time to pow're forth prayers To the all-hearing heavens, and may they be Propicious to her what e're [she] requests. I'm glad she shall have some play for her life, And not like ordinary malefactors Be brought, voyde of all hope, unto the gallowes. Mont. Feredo, goe, wayte on the Princesse hether. But now, my Lord before the Champions Appeare, 'twere good we did agree which of The two should be the man. Arn. Let them agree Of that themselves. Mont. But say they'll both contend For the precedency. Arn. Then let the dice Decide the question, and fayre fall the chance. Enter Feredo, leading the Princesse vayl'd and her woman. Mont. Madame, be not dismay'd, be of good courage, This unexpected comming of your friends So in the nicke of time is a good omen, For such a one pray take't, and take your place. (She bowes and is led to the seate. Now some give notice to the Challenger The Court attends him. Phil. (aside) Had they but stay'd One houre yet longer, my revenge had beene Compleate without the counterchecke of chance: But I hope well in Garamont, and come What will come, I am satisfi'de in part, And should be fully saw I her head start. (Trumpets sound. Enter Garamont, who takes his place.) Mont. 'Tis now, my Lord, the last time we can aske The last time you can answere; be well advis'd You yet may time enough recant and if I might prevayle with you, you should do so. Sir, you are not the first hath beene deceiv'd, I doe beleeve you thinke you saw the Princesse In wanton dalliance, as you have affirm'd, But doe beleeve you may have seene amisse. Doe you beleeve so too, and thereby make The King as much your friend as he shall doe Who by the hazzard of his life shall free His daughter of the calumny You lay upon her, And that you may not doubt there will want those Will undertake it, know, that there are two Who take upon them Florabell's defense. Gar. Sir, now I thanke my fates, and ne're till now; The mightiest witt, or man best fraught with art, If they doe want materialls, whereupon To shew their high conceits, their curious skill, May boast (and that is all) of their perfections, But never try it by the touch of trueth. Had I not met some object, whereupon By vent'ring of my bloud, my zeale I might Make manifest to Bellamour's dead corpse, And thereby strive t'appease his injur'd ghost, I should not have had given so true a test Of my true friendship: men perhaps might thinke If I had met with opposition, I Should have done what you, my Lord, advise, And yet Sir, I doe thanke you for your counsell, As knowing it proceedes from forth a breast Full fraught with honour. But I must crave pardon For not obeying you therein, the name Of friend, of grossely injur'd friend, Must pleade my pardon both to you and all The world besides; therefore I pray, my Lords, If there be any champion that appeares, Let him be sent for, so I may eschew The twice repeating what will be no lesse Grievous to me to speake than you to heare, For never did two contrarietyes So struggle for the upper hand in man As now they doe in me. Mont. Call in the Champions. Gar. I am not ignorant what hatred I Deservedly plucke on me from the State, The King, the Subjects, you fayre Florabell, The blame I shall incurre from all who shall Hereafter heare of this, and not consider Perhaps so duely as they ought th'inciting cause. Enter Champions. But when I put the thought, the thought! the knowledge Of Bellamour's much undeserved wrongs, His sufferings which thereupon ensued, Into the other ballance, they weigh downe the scale, And therefore thus I doe avouch for truth, Which with my sword I'm ready to make good 'Gainst any dare maintaine the contrary, The Princesse Florabella is unchast, And hath committed that (I looking on) For which the Lawes doome her to death, And I require of you, my Lords, who are Our Soveraigne's substitutes, the Law be put In execution; if any here Doe doubt of this, and dare make good his doubt I thus defie himâ (He throws downe his glove.) Take it up who dare, And I not doubt to doe the wretch to death. (The two champions stoope and struggle for the glove.) Mont. Part the contestors, take the glove from both, And give it to the Princesse at the barre. If it stand with your liking, Lord Arnaldo, Let her who hath most int'rest in the quarrell Decide the businesse. Arn. No evener way, Lesse leaning towards partiality Can be imagined; 'tis reason she Whose life and honour both lye at the stake Doe chuse her champion; nor can these Gentlemen (Her choyce once made) appeale from thence, they both I rest assured will stand to her decree. (They both bow in token of assent.) Then take the glove Feredo, give it to The Princesse; now Madame, come from the barre, And chuse your Champion: he to whom you give The glove, must be the man for whose successe Your pray'rs and ours must joyntly seeke to heaven. (She comes forth, makes low reverence to the lesser Champion, gives her glove to the taller, so retireth. Bellamour. (disguis'd, in a counterfeit voice, saith) First, Madame, give me leave to kisse your hand In humble thankfulnesse for this your favour; Next, let me begge of you that whil'st I doe Make your accuser doe just penance for His blacke assertion, you be not afraid, But have assured faith of prosperous Successe in him who lives or dyes your servant. And now to you Sir, fewest words are best, He lyes that saith the Princesse is unchast. (The warning to the battell is given by Trumpets, they fight, and having fought awhile, Sylvander comes in with Lucina in man's apparell, who parteth the Combatants. Syl. Put truce awhile to your death-doing swords, Brave Cavaliers, and no one stroake make more, Have patience till I shall say what will, Without the shedding of your noble bloud, Decide this question, cleare that spotlesse Princesse. Mont. Ha! what's that he saith? Stand some of you Betweene the Combatants, keepe them from further fighting Till he be heard: now Sir, pray speake your minde. Syl. I first pronounce the Princesse cleare, as is The childe unborne, of what she stands accus'd, Next, I embrace the Challenger, as one who doeth Deserve the best of names, name of a faithful friend. Nor must you, bold brave Sir, scape unsaluted, Y'have done enough by this your undertaking To eternize your fame; and now to you, My Lords, I must addresse my speech. Know then That if this combat further do proceede, And (as 'tis likely) death ensue therefrom, Whether the challenger or challenged Doe dye, he dyeth innocent; the one Thinks he is in the right, nay I dare say, Beleeves it confidently, nor doe I Blame him for doing so; so should I doe Were I as he, yet surely he's i'th'wrong, Unwittingly a falsehood he maintaines. The selfe same errour, which bereav'd of life His dearest friend, makes him take armes in hand To vindicate his suppos'd injury. The other knowes not whether he maintaine The trueth or no, nor thinke I he doeth much Regard the justnesse of his cause, even just as he Doeth, should I do were I in his place. 'Tis noblenesse of spirit, meere good nature Makes him to grapple thus with death itselfe, To save from perishing so great a beauty, And yet the right o'th'cause is wholly his. I helpe and comforte bring to th'innocent, But death and dire damnation to the guilty. Mont. Sir, you have promis'd much, may you performe As bravely, then we all shall worship you. To shew that we covet as much to heare What you would say as you to utter it, We doe ordayne cessation of armes 'Till you have said. Be pleas'd then Gentlemen, To lay aside your weapons for a while, For ever, if this Gentleman make good His word; if otherwise you shall again Resume them. Now Sir, speake your minde at large. Syl. Then thus my Lords, I doe accuse the Prince, Philochres, that trayterous Prince, Of all the mischiefs hath ensu'd as yet, And what hereafter might ensue heereon, Were't not that I miraculously met With the discovery of all his plots. Phil. My Lords, this fellow raves, lay treachery To my charge! I demand the Law, my Lords, The execution of the Law against This fowle-mouthed slaunderer. (aside) I'm sure Lucina, Is safe enough, and then I feare no peaching. Syl. O Sir, is't you that are the Prince Philocres? I'm glad I have you heere; e're you and I Doe part, the world shall see that fowle Mouth'd slaunderer you speake of prove your selfe. It was not you, who 'cause that Florabella Would not give eare to your unpleasing suite, Did plot revenge upon her; caus'd Lucina, Her bed-fellow who much did dote on you To d'on the Princesses cloathes, then give you meeting At the Balconye window, before which You formerly had placed Bellamour, That he might see you clamber up the window, And take Lucina for the Princesse, who (As he it seems deserv'd) bore more affection To him than you; No, nor it was not you That sent Lucina to be murdered By two base Rascalls, making her beleeve You'd send her to your Gally, and straight come Your selfe and marry her; all this for feare Least somewhat might be sifted out of her, Whereby your villany might come to light. Phil. You say true, Sir, indeede it was not I. Syl. You lye, false Prince, 'twas you, and none but you Which thus I'le make good. (They draw and fight. Mont. Part them, I charge you. This is more than lyeth In our commission, which extends no further Than to the combat 'twixt the challenger And the defender of the Ladye's cause, The which though that this man be, he does not though Fight 'gainst the challenger. Now sir, be pleas'd To make your legall proofes of what y'have said, And be assur'd you shall have all fayre hearing. Syl. Then thus, sir, to my proofes: know you this face, (He pluckes out Lucina's hat and beard.) Nay never blush for't man, murder will out. Arn. The Gods are just, and we for this their care And providence over our Princesse' life And fame, have ever cause to prayse them, For surely all is true this gentleman Affirmes. How say you minion? is it not? Luc. (kneels) My Lords, I trust I shall the sooner taste Of mercy from you, pardon from you, Madame, When't it does appeare I was not of the plot Of any harm intended to the Princesse, And since't hath pleas'd the Gods to make of me As well as instrument to cleare her, as Unwittingly I was to work her ruine, This in mine own excuse admitted, I assure All that this noble Gentleman hath said Is trueth, nor do I thinke Philocres dare deny it. Mont. How say you, Sir? 'tis your turne now to speake. Phil. I am a Prince, you cannot torture me, I crave leave to be gone, and whilst I stay Within this kingdome, I will nothing say. (Exit. Mont. Then silence gives consent. Goe call the King That he may be the first may bring his daughter From the accused barre to Throne of State And we surrender up our place to them (They both come down. Which with how much more joy I shall goe downe Than I came up, I take the heavens to witnesse. Arn. Were the degrees tenne times as high methinkes I could them caper down, So much of lively-hood have you deare Sir, By this your blest discovery put into me. And now my Lords and Gentlemen, all friends Let's all shake hands, all share in equall joy. Why seeme you yet so sad, Lord Garamont, In this glad time of universall mirth? I boldly dare affirm it was no spleene By you borne to the Princesse made you take This businesse in hand, but to expresse Your friendship to your good friend Bellamour, Which since you have so well perform'd, as all The world will scarcely parallelle, not outdoe you, Me thinkes you should with us joyne in expressions Of mirth and jollitye. Gar. You are, my Lord, Much in the right: so may I thrive as I (For what concern'd myselfe) did with as much Reluctancy accuse the Princesse, as You would have seene her head ta'ne off, and therefore In charity you will beleeve I share As deeply in this general joy, as you Or any heere, and if my lookes doe not Paint forth my joy in full as lively colours As may be seen in yours and all these faces Which doe surround you, judge the cause aright, For when I thinke on Bellamour's disaster His most unfortunate mistake, wherein I shar'd as well as he, when, as I thinke How wellcome these newes would have beene to him, Who now's become incapable thereof, I must confesse it somewhat doeth allay The height of happinesse I else should have. Mont. 'Tis true, my Lord, but where nought will avayle It is lost labour to lament and wayle. Bell. But I were much to blame should I permit This sadnesse on his soul one minute sit: See here, my best of friends, your Bellamour. (He discovers himselfe.) Gar. If this be true and nothing false here meant, I'le vye with all the world for true content. (They all salute Bellamour. Enter King. King. What meanes that mass of people heap't together? 'Pray God there be nothing of new arrived To counterpoyse my unexpected blisse. Be it but some meane crosse I shall applaude The destinyes in their care over me, Who may have sent some rubbe, least too much joy Might have had strucke me dead. Mont. Let's leave saluting: see where comes the King; Sir, though I doe presume you have already Partaken of the newes you most desired, The undoubted cleering of your spotlesse daughter, Yet if you have but any cranny left Within your Princely breast, unfill'd with joy, Heere's wherewithall to cramme it full. He who did undertake the Princesse' cause Is prov'd to be your servant Bellamour. King. Softly I say: doe not so all at once Heape on your blessed tidings; let me disgest them (Bellamour kisseth his hand. Peace-meale, least excesse doe cause a surfeit. One short ejaculation of thankes to heaven, Which shall more fully praysed be hereafter. I first to you, my daughter, turne myselfe And crave your pardon: if I for a while Forbeare to fetch you forth from where you are To where you should be, heere: you are our owne, And all respects ought first be show'en to strangers, And yet because I cannot long forbeare To see what once within this houre I would Have given my crowne to see, I will be short In thanking all these cavalyers, who have share In this your freedom. 'Tis not words, but deeds Speakes thankfullnesse: To witnesse then my thankes I in a King's word promise to these three, Who stickled in my daughter's cause, a boone, A boone to each of them, whate're it be They shall demand shall graunted be by me. They who did know so well how to employ Their service, will as well know what to ask A guiderdon; and now daughter, to youâ (He takes her from the Barre, pulles off her vayle, and instead of his daughter findes her mayde Fiducia. What meanes this Pageant? I not like these trickes, Say some of youâwhat do you say? You stand Amazed gazing one on another As if you knew not how to doe withall. On your alleageance I charge you all Reade me this Riddle; you, Montalto, say What meanes this property? I cannot brooke delay. Mont. May't please your Majesty, I know not what To say or thinke, I know no tricke that's in't, I tooke Fiducia, vayl'd, to be your daughter. King. May't please your Maistership, it does not please me, Speake, some that's wiser. Omnes. Sir we are all In this as ignorant as he. Arn. You'd best inquire Of her who tooke her place upon her, she Is likelyest t'unfold the businesse. King. Speake then, good wench, hold up this jest no longer, Where is my daughter? what's become of her? Fid. In sooth I cannot tell. King. In sooth, forsooth, Or tell, or I will torture't out of you; How came you hither? you can tell me that. Fid. Obedience to my Mistresse's command Brought me thus hither: This morning when she wak't, (And trueth to say she hardly slep't all night) She call'd me to her, whisper'd me i'th'eare, And made me vow secrecy and assistance; She then sent forth her other mayde Nigretta Upon some sleeveless errand which might keepe Her busy till she had dispatch't with me. Nigretta gone, and none but she and I I'th'chamber left, she said, My good Fiducia 'Tis now that I must try thy love and service. Goe, get some boyes apparell; aske not why? But straightway bring it hither: I obey'd, And brought a suite was yesterday brought home For a young brother of mine; she instantly Leapt out of bed, and don'd those cloathes; she made Me strippe my selfe and put on her apparell, Put on her vayle; which when I'de done, she said, Inquire not after me whether I goe, Or what I meane to do; when they shall come To fetch me forth, goe you in stead of me, And play my part, leave me to play another; I pawne my troath there shall no harm ensue To you, Fiducia; not one hayre of your's Shall fall into the ground; but that was more Than needed; to have saved her head I would full willingly have lost mine owne. She went her way, And as she went came you Nigretta in, Since when you know you could not get me speake One word. Sir, now you know all I can say. King. I know you are a cunning hallotry, But must know more than this, or ne're know more, What say you, Mistrisse Minkes? how goes affayres? Nig. Sir may I dye a mayde, if I know ought Belonging thereunto; when I came backe I found her, whom I for my Mistrisse tooke Sitting cross't-armed, with head hung in her bosome, Who, doe I what I would, would ne'er be brought To speake one word; I wayted on her hither, Still taking her to be the Princesse, this Is all I can affirme. King. Was ever King thus cros't In mids't of all his joyes; but I will sift It out, or make some smart for't: who waytes there? Goe, take this piece of frailty; dragge her to The racke, I'le trye, whether or no The extention of her joynts will serve t'enlarge Her tongue. Fid. Before I goe know allâ King. Stay her, I thought the racke would draw it forth. Fid. That whatso'ere through frailty of my flesh, To tortures not iniur'd, I may perchance Hereafter say or more or lesse than what I have already said, is nothing so; for may My soule share blisse, as I the trueth doe say. King. Goe, dragge her hence, and see her soundly tortur'd. Flor. (kneels) I begge the boone your Majestie was pleas'd To promise me. King. Name it, and it is granted. Flo. This mayde's release from bonds, or further torture. King. Thinke on some other suite, this must not be. Flo. Your word is past, I'le nothing begge but this. Arn. Sir, be persuaded, truely I beleeve The mayde hath told the trueth; besides your word Is past, and cannot be recalled with honour. To adde to this, there is no doubt, where e're The Princesse is, when she shall heare of this She'll instantly return to Court. We all Will goe in pursuite of her. King. Loose the mayde. Flo. Thankes to your Majesty; and heere I vow Since my fates would not suffer me to fight For Florabella, never to see Your Majesty till I have found her out, And brought her to you. Come you along with me. (Exit Florabella and Fiducia. Bell. Till newes be heard of her, there shall no newes Be heard of Bellamour. I'le seeke the world Throughout but I will find her. (Exit. Mont. Sir, courage, certainely she will be found. King. I hope she will; meanetime pray let us know To whom it is we stand so much indebted, And how you came to make this blest discovery. Syl. Sir, I'm a Cyprian of the Isle of Cyprus: The reason of my comming hither was To seeke a Prince out; now the king of Cyprus, (For our late king is lately dead) his sonne Some six months since, for that his father would Have forced a marriage on him, left the Court, And privately stole in disguise away, Leaving a note behinde him in his study, Whereby he signified he had tak'n an oath Which he would most religiously observe Ne're to returne, nor yet make himselfe know'en For what he was, whils't that his father lived. The old king hearing this, strucke through with griefe Fell sicke, and five months after died. Our State Now wants a Governour, to helpe the which Fifty o'th'Court, whereof myselfe am one Tooke all a vow never backe to returne Till we had found the Prince, or heard newes of him. My lot fell this way, where whils't I was riding, Not many houres agoe amidst a wood I heard an hideous outcrye; I spurr'd on A pace towards the place from whence it came, And well it was I spurr'd, else all had been in vayne, For I might see two villaines with their weapons About to murder her whom here you see, Whose screekes brought me to succour her; the slaves When they saw me betooke them to their heeles, And did, to save themselves, not murder her; My errand was not to pursue them flying, But rescue her, as luckily I did, When she had taken breath, and found her selfe, In safer custody than formerly, I asked her why this outrage was intended; She told me all what y'have heard already Touching the treason plotted 'gainst the life Of Florabella, and how she herselfe By the same treacherous Prince was doom'd to death, For, that her death might be more terrible The rogues had told her this before: You will beleeve when I heard this I made What haste I could to do what I have done, Save th'innocent and makes the guilty know'en, I onely stay'd to make my footboye shift Apparell with Lucina, that she so Might come along with me disguis'd and serve If neede should be for witnesse, as sh'has done, And now, Sir, you know all. King. I know myselfe indebted much to you Which to requite I'le use all power I have To finde your Prince out; to that end Montalto, Give order Proclamation be made in every place Which may divulge the King of Cyprus death. (Exit Montalto. I'le write to all my neighbour Princes Intreating them to do the like, this way 'Tis like the Prince may soonest here of it, Which when he doeth he surely will returne. Syl. I humbly thanke your Majesty for this So noble favour, which our State shall know. (Enter Florabella in her own clothes, who kneeleth downe before her father and saith Flo. Your pardon, Sir, for having been the cause Of some houres sorrow in you. King. My Florabell, My dearest childe, and now more deare than ever Since freed from calumny! where hast thou beene? Goe, call backe Bellamour, say she is found. Fer. Ne're did the Grayhound with more willingnesse Pursue the flying hare than I'le doe him. (Exit Feredo. Flo. Sir, when I saw the time draw neere and none Appeare in my defense, rather than perish So calmely, I resolved to be Mine own defender. I did thinke the Gods Would never suffer innocence to suffer, Besides there was by this course some meanes offer'd Of coveted revenge, which I was sure To purchase in some sort, For or I should have overcome, or when th'accuser Should see whom he had slayne, 'twould have appeas'd My slaunder'd soul to see how 'twould have vex'd him: I to this purpose did what you have heard Fiducia relate, but was prevented in The execution of my designes As you have seene Sir. King. Happily prevented. Enter Bellamour and Feredo. Bell. The King of Cyprus's dead, the Princesse found And innocent; then Sir, I crave the boone You promised with more assurance than I thought I should have done. I crave your daughter For wife unto the King of Cyprus. (He discovereth himselfe to be Prince of Cyprus. Syl. Beyond my hopes see I have found him out: Sir, thus in name of all your subjects I Salute you King of Cyprus. King. And I with joy not easily expres't Doe thus make good my boone. Take her, and take With her more joy than e're befell a Prince; I neede not aske your leave, deare daughter, neede I? (He gives him Florabella. Flo. Sir, you have given me more of true content In this, than I till now had cause to hope for: Yet I must begge one favour more. King. Speake on, Denyalls now are out of season. Flo. That you'll be pleas'd, Sir, to forgive Lucina. Syl. Madame, 'twas that I mean't t'have made my boone, But since your Highnesse hath prevented me, I crave another, th'abrogation Of this to women too unjust a Law. King. All's graunted: Pardons, Boones, whate're they be, For this must be a day of Jubilye. FINIS.</field>
