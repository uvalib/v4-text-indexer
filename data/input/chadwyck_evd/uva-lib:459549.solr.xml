      <field name="fulltext">PRIMUS PASTOR On wouldes have I walked wylde under buskes my bowre to bylde, from styffe stormes my sheepe to shilde, my seemely wedders to save. From comlye Conwaye unto Clyde under tyldes them to hyde, a better shepperd on no syde noe yearthlye man maye have. For with walkynge werye I have mee rought; besydes the suche my sheepe I sought. My taytfull tuppes are in my thought, them to save and heale from the shrewde scabbe yt sought, or the rotte, yf yt were wrought. If the cough had them caught of hyt I could them heale. Loe, here bee my herbes saffe and sownde, wysely wrought for everye woundeâ the woulde a whole man bringe to grownde within a little whyleâ of henbane and horehounde, tybbe, radishe, and egermonde, which bee my herbes save and sounde, medled on a rowe. Here be more herbes, I tell yt you; I shall recken them on a rowe: fynter, fanter, and fetterfowe, and alsoe penyewrytte. This is all that I knowe. For be yt wether or be yt yowe, I shall heale then on a rowe cleane from theyre hurte. Here is tarre in a pott to heale them from the rott; well I can and well I wott the talgh from them take. And yf sworne yt had the thursse, yett shall the talgh be in my purse, and the sheepe never the worse to renne on the rake. But noe fellowshippe here have I save myselfe alone, in good faye; therfore after one faste wyll I crye. But first will I drinke, if I maye. Hic potat Primus Pastor. Howe, Harvye, howe! Drive thy sheepe to the lowe. Thow maye not here excepte I blowe, as ever have I heale. Hic flabit Primus Pastor. SECUNDUS PASTOR Yt is no shame for mee to shewe how I was set for to sowe with the fether of a crowe a clowte upon my heele. Sitt downe. Fellowe, nowe be we well mett. And though methinke us needes, had wee Tudd heere by us sett, thenn might wee sitte and feede us. PRIMUS PASTOR Yea, to feede us frendly in faye, how might wee have our service? Crye thow must lowd, by this daye; Tudd is deafe and may not well here us. Secundus Pastor vocat submissa voce: How, Tudd; come, for thy fathers kyn. PRIMUS PASTOR Naye, faye; thy voyce is wonders dym. Why, knowys thow not him? Fye, man, for shame! Call him Tudd, Tybbys sonne, and then wyll the shrewe come; for in good fayth yt is his wonne to love well his damys name. SECUNDUS PASTOR How, Tudd, Tybbys sonne! TERTIUS PASTOR Syr, in fayth nowe I come, for yett have I not all donne that I have to done: to seeth salve for our sheepe andâlest my wiffe should yt weeteâ with great gravell and greete I scowre [an] ould panne. Hemlocke and hayriffeâtake keepeâ with tarreboyste must bene all tamed, penyegrasse and butter for fatt sheepe; for thys salve am I not ashamed. Ashamed am I not to shewe no poynt that longeth to my crafte; noe betterâthat I well knoweâ in land is nowhere lafte. For, good men, this is not unknowen to husbandes that benne here abowt: that eych man muste bowe to his wife, and commonly for feare of a clowte. Thus for clowtes now care I; all ys for feare of our dame-keynn. Now wyll caste my ware hereby, and hye faste that I were at Hankeynn. Hankeyn, hold up thy hand and have mee, that I were on height there by thee. PRIMUS PASTOR Gladly, syr, and thow would bee by me, for loth me is to denye thee. SECUNDUS PASTOR Nowe sythen God hath gathered us together, with good harte I thanke him of his grace. Welcome be thow, well fayre wedder. Tudd, will we shape us to some solace? TERTIUS PASTOR Solace would best be seene that we shape us to our supper; for meate and drinke, well I deeme, to eych deede is most dere. PRIMUS PASTOR Laye forth, eych man ilych, what hee hath lafte of his liverye. And I wyll put forth my pyche with my parte firste of us all three. SECUNDUS PASTOR And such store as my wife had in your sight soone shall you see, at our begininge us to glade; for in good meate ther is mych glee. Here is bredd this daye was bacon, onyons, garlycke, and leekes, butter that bought was in Blacon, and greene cheese that will greese well your cheekes. TERTIUS PASTOR And here ale of Halton I have, and whot meate I had to my hyer; a puddinge may noe man deprave, and a jannock of Lancastershyre. Loe, here a sheepes head sowsed in ale, and a grayne to laye on the greene, and sowre milke. My wyffe had ordayned a noble supper, as well is seene. PRIMUS PASTOR Nowe will I caste of my cloacke and put ont parte of my liverye, put owt that I have in my poacke, and a pigges foote from puddinges purye. TERTIUS PASTOR Abyde, fellowes, and yee shall see here this hott meateâwee serven yt hereâ gambonns and other good meate in fere, a puddinge with a pricke in the ende. PRIMUS PASTOR My sotchell to shake out to sheppardes am I not ashamed. And this tonge pared rownd aboute with my teeth yt shalbe atamed. Tunc commedent, et dicat Primus Pastor: Byd me doe gladly, and I thee, for by God here is good growsinge; come eate with us, God of heavon hye, but take noe heede though here be noe howsinge. SECUNDUS PASTOR Howsinge ennough have wee here while that wee have heavon over our heddes. Now to weete our mouthes tyme were; this flackett will I tame, if thow reade us. TERTIUS PASTOR And of this bottell nowe will I bibbe, for here is bowles of the best. Such lickour makes men to live; this game may noewhere be leste. PRIMUS PASTOR Fellowes, nowe our bellyes be full, thinke wee on him that keepes our flockes. Blowe thy horne and call after Trowle, and bydd him, sonne, of our bytlockes. SECUNDUS PASTOR Well sayd, Hankyn, by my soothe, for that shrewe I suppose us seekes. My horne to lille I wyll not lesse tyll that lad have some of our leekes. TERTIUS PASTOR Leekes to his liverye is likinge; such a lad nowhere in land is. Blowe a note for that meetinge whyle that horne nowe in thy hand ys. PRIMUS PASTOR With this horne I shall make a âHooeâ that hee and all heaven shall here. Yonder lad that sittes on a lowe the lowd of this horne shall here. Tunc cantabit, et dicat Garcius: Good lord, looke on mee and my flocke here as the fed have. On this wold walke wee; are no men here, that noe waye. All is playne, perdee; therefore, sheepe, we mon goe. Noe better may bee of beast that blood and bonne have. Wotte I not, day or night, necessaryes that to mee beelongen. Tarboyste and tarboll yee shall here; nettle, hemlock, and butter abydinge, and my good dogge Dottynolle that is nothinge cheeffe of his chydinge. Yf any man come mee bye and would wytt which waye beste were, my legge I lifte up wheras I lye and wishe him the waye easte and west where. And I rose where I laye, me would thinke that travell lost. For kinge ne duke, by this daye, ryse I will notâbut take my rest here. Nowe wyll I sitt here adowne and pippe at this pott like a pope. Would God that I were downe harmeles, as I hastelye hope. Noe man drinke here shall save myselfe, the devyll of the sope. All this lottes I seet at little; nay, yee lades, sett I not by yee. For you have I manye a fowle fitt. Thow fowle filth, though thow flytt, I defye thee. PRIMUS PASTOR Trowle, take tent to my talkinge. For thy tooth here is good tugginge. While thy wedders benne walkinge, on this loyne thow may have good lugginge. GARCIUS Fye on your loynes and your liverye, your liverastes, livers, and longes, your sose, your sowse, your saverraye, your sittinge withowt any songes! One this hill I hold mee here. Noe hape to your hot meate have I. But flyte with my fellowes in feare, and your sheepe full sycerly save I. SECUNDUS PASTOR For thow saves our sheepe, good knave, take keepe. Sythen thow may not sleepe, come eate of this sowse. GARCIUS Nay, the dyrte is soe deepe, stopped therin for to steepe; and the grubbes theron do creepe at whom at thy howse. Therfore meate, if I maye, of your dightinge todaye will I nought by noe waye tyll I have my wages. I wend to have binne gaye but, see, soe ragged is myne araye; aye pinches is your paye to any poore page. TERTIUS PASTOR Trowle, boy, for Godes tree, come eate a morsell with me; and then wrastle will wee here on this wold. GARCIUS That shall I never flee! Though yt bee with all three to laye my liverye, that will I hold. Tunc ibit ad magistros suos, et dicat GARCIUS Nowe comes Trowle the Trewe; a torne to take have I tight with my masters. Or I rewe put him forth that moste is of might. PRIMUS PASTOR Trowle, better thow never knewe. Eate of this, meate for a knight. GARCIUS Naye, spare! Though I spewe, all upon your heades shall yt light. SECUNDUS PASTOR Howe should wee suffer this shame, of a shrewe thus to be shente? TERTIUS PASTOR This ladd lusts to be lame and lose a lymme or hee went. GARCIUS Have donne! Beginne wee this game. But warre lest your golyons glent. That were little dole to our dame, though in the myddest of the daye yee were drent. PRIMUS PASTOR False lad, fye on thy face! One this grownd thow shall have a fall. Hent one, and hould that thow hasse. Yf thow happe have, all goe to all. GARCIUS And this, syrs, here to solace. Hankyn, sheoparde, shame thee I shall. Wroth thow art, worse then thow was. Warre lest thow walter here by the wall. Tunc projiciat Primum Pastorem, et dicat Secundus Pastor. SECUNDUS PASTOR Boye, lest I breake thy bones, kneele downe and axe me a boone. Lest I destroy thee here on these stones, sease, lest I shend thee to soone. GARCIUS Gole thee to groyns and grownes! Good were thee thy ould ragges to save soone. Little dowbt of such drownes, lyther tyke, for thy deedes donne. TERTIUS PASTOR Owt, alas, hee lyes on his loynes! But lett mee goe now to that lad. Sheppardes he shames and shendes, for last now am I owt shad. GARCIUS Both your backes here to mee bendes; for all your boastes I hould you to bad. Hould your arses and your hinder loynes; then hope I to have as I have hadd. The better in the bore, as I had before of this bovearte, yea, hope I more. Keepe well thy score for feare of a farte. Tunc projiciat Tertium Pastorem, et dicat Garcius: Lye ther, lither, in the lake. My liverye nowe will I lach: this curye, this clowt, and this cake. For yee be cast, now will I catch. To the devyll I you all betake, as traytors attaynt of your tache! On this would with this will I walke; all the world wonder on the wache. Et sic recedat Garcius, et dicat Primus Pastor: Fellowes, this a fowle case ys, that wee bine thus cast of a knave. All agaynst our willes hee hase his; but I must needes hould the harmes that I have. SECUNDUS PASTOR That I have needes must I hold; of these unhappie harmes ofte here I. Therfore will I wayte on this would upon the wedder, for I am werye. TERTIUS PASTOR Though wee bine werye noe wonder, what betweene wrastlinge and wakinge. Ofte wee may bee in thought wee be now under. God amend hit with his makinge. Tunc sedebunt, et stella apparebit, et dicat Primus Pastor: What is all this light here that blasses soe bright here on my black beard? For to see this light here a man may bee afright here, for I am afeard. SECUNDUS PASTOR Feard for a fraye nowe may wee bee all nowe; and yett it is night, yett seemes yt day nowe. Never, soothly to saye nowe, see I such a sight. TERTIUS PASTOR Such a sight seeminge and a light leeminge lettes mee to looke. All to my deeminge, from a starre streaminge yt to mee stroacke. GARCIUS That starre if it stand to seek will I fond, though my sight fayle mee. While I may live in lond why should I not fond, yf it will avayle mee? Tunc respiciens firmamentum dicat Garcius: A, Godes mightis! In yonder starre light is; of the sonne this sight is, as yt nowe seemes. PRIMUS PASTOR Hit seemes, as I nowe see, a bright stare to bee, there to abyde. From yt wee may not flee but aye gloe on the glee, tyll yt downe glyde. PRIMUS PASTOR Fellowes, will wee kneele downe on our knee after comford to the trewe Trinitee, for to lead us for to see our elders lord? TERCIUS PASTOR Our lord will us lere in our prayer wherto yt will apent; and why on high here the eare is soe cleare, nowe shall wee be kent. GARCIUS Lord, of this light send us some sight why that it is sent. Before this night was I never soe afright of the firmament. PRIMUS PASTOR Ne, fye! By my faye, nowe is it nigh daye; so was it never. Therfore I praye the sooth us to saye, or that we desever. Tunc cantet Angelus: âGloria in excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.â Fellowes in feare, may yee not here this mutinge on highe? SECUNDUS PASTOR In âgloreâ and in âglereâ? Yett noe man was nere within our sight. TERTIUS PASTOR Naye, yt was a âglorye.â Nowe am I sorye bowt more songe. GARCIUS Of this strange storye such mirth is merye; I would have amonge. PRIMUS PASTOR As I then deemed, âselsisâ it seemed that hee songe soe. SECUNDUS PASTOR Whyle the light leemed, a wreakinge mee weened; I wyst never whoo. TERTIUS PASTOR What songe was this, saye yee, that he sange to us all three? Expounded shall yt bee erre wee hethen passe; for I am eldest of degree and alsoe best, as seemes mee, hit was âgrorus glorusâ with a âglee.â Hit was neyther more nor lasse. GARCIUS Nay, yt was âglorus glarus gloriusâ; methinke that note went over the howse. A seemely man hee was, and curiouse; but soone awaye hee was. PRIMUS PASTOR Nay, yt was âglorus glarusâ with a âglo,â and mych of âcelsisâ was therto. As ever have I rest or woo, much hee spake of âglas.â SECUNDUS PASTOR Naye, yt was neyther âglasâ nor âglye.â Therfore, fellowe, nowe stand bye. TERTIUS PASTOR By my fayth, hee was some spye, our sheepe for to steale. Or elles hee was a man of our crafte, for seemely hee was and [wounder] defte. GARCIUS Nay, hee came by nightâall thinges lefteâ our tuppes with tarre to teale. PRIMUS PASTOR Naye, on a âglorâ and on âglayâ and a âglyâ gurd Gabryell when hee so gloryd. When hee sange I might not be sorye; through my brest-bonne bletinge hee bored. SECUNDUS PASTOR Nay, by God, yt was a âgloria,â sayde Gabryell when hee sayde soe. He had a mych better voyce then I have, as in heaven all other have soe. TERTIUS PASTOR Wyll hee here howe hee sange âcelsisâ? For on that sadly hee sett him; nayther singes âsarâ nor soe well âcis,â ney âpax merye Mawd when shee had mett him.â GARCIUS On tyme hee touched on âtarre,â and therto I tooke good intent; all heaven might not have gonne harre, that note on high when hee up hent. PRIMUS PASTOR And after a âpaxâ or of âpeace,â up as a pye hee pyped; such a lodenâthis is noe lesseâ never in my life me so lyked. SECUNDUS PASTOR Upon âhominibusâ hee muted; that much mervayle to mee was. And aye I quoked when hee so whewted; I durst not hede wher that yt was. TERTIUS PASTOR Yett, yett, hee sange more then all this, for some word is worthye a forder. For hee sange âbonae voluntatisâ; that is a cropp that passeth all other. GARCIUS Yett and yett he sange more to; from my mynde yt shall not starte. Hee sange alsoe of a âDeoâ; me thought that heled my harte. And that word âterraâ hee tamedâ therto I toke good intent. And âpaxâ alsoe may not be blamed; for that to this songe I assent. PRIMUS PASTOR Nowe pray wee to him with good intent, and singe I wyll and me [unbrace]: that hee will lett us to bee kent, and to send us of his grace. SECUNDUS PASTOR Nowe syth I have all my will, never in this world soe well I was. Singe wee nowe, I rede us, shryll a mery songe us to solace. GARCIUS Singe we nowe; lett see, some songe will I assaye. All men nowe singes after mee, for musicke of mee learne yee maye. Tunc cantabunt et postea dicat Tertius Pastor (Here singe âtroly, loly, loly, loo.â): Nowe wend we forth to Bethlem, that is best our songe to bee, for to see the starre-gleme, the fruyt alsoe of that mayden free. PRIMUS PASTOR Nowe followe we the starre that shines, tyll we come to that holy stable. To Bethlem boyne the lymes; followe we yt withowt any fable. SECUNDUS PASTOR Followe we hit and hyes full fast; such a frende loth us were to fayle. Launche on! I will not be the last upon Marye for to mervayle. Hic vadunt versus Bethlem. TERTIUS PASTOR Stynt nowe; goe no moe steppes, for now the starre beginneth to stand. Harvye, that good bene our happes we seeneâby our Savyour fonde. Hic apparet Angelus et dicat: Sheppardes, of this sight be ye not afright, for this is Godes might; takes this in mynde. To Bethlem nowe right; there yee shall see in sight that Christ is borne tonight to cover all mankynde. GARCIUS To Bethlem take wee the waye, for with you I thinke to wend, that prince of peace for to praye heaven to have at our ende. And singe we all, I read, some myrth to his majestee, for certayne now see wee it indeede: the kinge Sone of heavon is hee. PRIMUS PASTOR Sym, sym, securlye here I see Marye, and Jesus Christ fast bye lapped in haye. SECUNDUS PASTOR Kneele we downe in hye and praye wee him of mercye, and welcome him worthelye that woe does awaye. TERTIUS PASTOR Awaye all our woe ys and many mans moe ys. Christ, lord, lett us kys the cratch or the clothes. GARCIUS Solace nowe to see this byldes in my brest blys: never after to do amys, thinge that him loth ys. PRIMUS PASTOR Whatever this ould man that here ys? Take heede how his head ys whore. His beard is like a buske of bryers with a pound of heare about his mouth and more. SECUNDUS PASTOR More ys this marveyle to mee nowe, for to nappe greatly him needes. Hartles is hee nowe for aye to his heeles hee heedes. TERTIUS PASTOR Why, with his berde though hit be rough, right well to her hee hydes. Worthye wight, witt would wee nowe; wyll ye worne us, worthye in weedes? MARIA Sheppardes, sothlye I see that my sonne you hyther sent, through Godes might in majestye that in mee light and here is lent. This man maryed was to mee for noe sinne in such assent; but to keepe my virginitee, and truly in non other intent. JOSEPH Good men, Moyses take in mynde: as he was made through God allmight, ordayned lawes us to bynde which that wee should keepe of right; man and woman for to bynde lawefully them both to light; to fructifye, as men may fynde, that tyme was wedded every wight. Therfore wedded to her I was as lawe would: her for to lere for noyse nor slander nor trespasse, and through that deede the devill to dere, as tould mee Gabriell, full of grace. When I had trussed all my gere to have fled and to have never seene her face, by him was I arested there. For hee sayde to mee sleepinge that shee lackles was of sinne. And when I hard that tokeninge, from her durst I noe waye twynne. Therfore goes forth and preach this thinge, all together and not in twynne: that you have seene your heavonly kinge common all mankynde to mynne. PRIMUS PASTOR Great God, syttynge in thy troone, that made all thinge of nought, nowe wee may thanke thee eychone: this is hee that wee have sought. SECUNDUS PASTOR Goe wee neere anone with such as we have brought. Ringe, brooche, or pretiouse stoneâ lett see whether we have ought to proffer. TERTIUS PASTOR Lett us doe him homage. PRIMUS PASTOR Whoe shall goe first? The page? SECUNDUS PASTOR Naye, yee be father in age. Therfore ye must first offer. PRIMUS PASTOR Hayle, kinge of heavon soe hye, borne in a crybbe; mankynd unto thee thow hast made full sybbe. Hayle, kynge, borne in a maydens bowre. Profettes did tell thow should be our succour; this clarkes do saye. Loe, I bringe thee a bell; I praye thee save me from hell, soe that I maye with thee dwell and serve thee for aye. SECUNDUS PASTOR Hayle, the emperour of hell and of heaven alsoe; the feynd shalt thow fell, that ever hath binne fals. Hayle, the maker of the stare that stoode us beforne; hayle, the blessedesfull baronne that ever was borne. Loe, sonne, I bringe thee a flackett. Therby hanges a spoone for to eat thy pottage with at noone, as I myselfe full oftetymes have donne. With hart I praye thee to take yt. TERTIUS PASTOR Hayle, prince withowten any pere, that mankynde shall releeve. Hayle, the fooe unto Lucyfere, the which beguyled Eve. Hayle, the graunter of hope, for one yearth now thow dwelles. Loe, sonne, I bringe thee a cappe, for I have nothinge elles. This gifte, sonne, that I give thee ys but smalle; and though I come the hyndmost of all, when thow shalt men to thy blys call, good lord, yett thinke one mee. GARCIUS My deare, with dryrie unto thee I mee dresse, my state on felloweshippe that I doe not lose; and for to save mee from all yll sicknesse, I offer unto thee a payre of my wyves ould hose. For other jewells, my sonne, have I none thee for to give that is worthe anythinge at all, but my good harte whyle I lyve and my prayers tyll death doth mee call. THE FIRST BOYE Nowe to you, my fellowes, this doe I saye, for in this place, or that I wynde awaye: unto yonder chyld lett us goe praye, as our masters have donne us beforne. THE SECOND BOYE And of such goodes as wee have here, lett us offer to this prince so dere, and to his mother, that mayden clere, that of her body hasse [him] borne. THE FIRST BOY Abyde, syrres, I will goe firste to yonder kinge. THE SECOND BOYE And I will goe nexte to that lordinge. THE THYRD BOYE Then will I be last of this offeringe; this can I saye, noe more. THE FIRST BOYE Nowe, lord, for to give thee have I nothinge, neyther gold, silver, brooch, ne ringe, nor noe rich robes meete for a kinge that I have here in store. But thoe hit lacke a stopple, take thee here my well fayre bottle, for yt will hold a good pottle; in fayth, I can give thee noe more. THE SECOND BOYE Lord, I know that thow art of this virgine borne, in full poore araye sittinge one her arme. For to offer to thee have I noe skorne, althoo thou be but a child. For jewell have I none to give thee to mayntayne thy royall dignitye; but my hood, take yt thee, as thow art God and man. THE THYRD BOYE O noble chyld of thy Father on hye, alas, what have I for to give thee? Save only my pype that soundeth so royallye, elles truely have I nothinge at all. Were I in the rocke or in the valey alowe, I could make this pipe sound, I trowe, that all the world should ringe and quaver as yt would fall. THE IIIIth BOYE Nowe, chyld, although thou be commen from God and bee thyselfe God in thy manhoode, yet I knowe that in thy chyldhood thow will for sweetemeat looke. To pull downe apples, payres, and ploomes, ould Joseph shall not neede to hurte his handes; because thow haste not plentye of cromes, I give thee here my nuthooke. PRIMUS PASTOR Nowe farewell, mother and maye, for of synne nought thow wottest. Thow hast brought forth this daye Godes Sonne of mightis most. Wherfore men shall saye: âBlessed in every coast and place be hee, memoriall for us all.â And that wee may from synne fall and stand ever in his grace, our lord God bee with thee. SECUNDUS PASTOR Brethren, lett us all three singinge walke homwardlye. Unkynd will I never in noe case bee, but preach all that I can and knowe, as Gabryell taught by his grace mee. Singinge awaye hethen will I. TERTIUS PASTOR Over the sea, and I may have grace, I will gange and goe abowt nowe to preach this thinge in every place; and sheepe will I keepe no more nowe. GARCIUS I read wee us agree for our mysdeedes amendes to make, for soe nowe will I; and to the chyld I wholey mee betake for aye securlye. Sheppardes craft I forsake; and to an anker herby I will in my prayers wach and wake. PRIMUS PASTOR And I an hermitte to prayse God, to praye, to walke by stye and by streytt, in wildernes to walke for aye. And I shall noe man meete but for my livinge I shall him praye, barefoote one my feete. And thus will I live ever and aye. For aye, ever, and alwayse, this world I fully refuse, my mysse to amend with monys. Turne to thy fellowes and kys. I yelde, for in youth we have bine fellowes, iwys. Therfore lend me your mouth, and frendly let us kysse. SECUNDUS PASTOR From London to Lowth such another shepperd I wott not where is. Both frend and cowth, God grant you all his blys. TERTIUS PASTOR To that blys bringe you great God, if that thy will bee. Amen, all singe you; good men, farewell yee. GARCIUS Well for to fare, eych frend, God of his might graunt you; for here now we make an ende. Farewell, for wee from you goe nowe. Finis</field>
