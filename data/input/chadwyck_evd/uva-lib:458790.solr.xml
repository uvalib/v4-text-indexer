      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDIE OF CHABOT ADMIRALL OF FRANCE:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Speakers. Asall. Allegre. King. Queene. Treasuror. Chancellor. Admirall. Father. Generall. Chabot. Iudges. Officers. Secretary. Ushers. Constable. Courtiers. Porter. Guard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Enter Asall, and Allegre. Asall. Now Phillip Chabot, Admirall of France, The great, and onely famous Favorite To Francis first of that Imperiall name, Hath found a fresh competitor in glory, (Duke Montmorancie, Constable of France) Who drinkes as deepe as he of the streame Royall, And may in little time convert the strength To raise his spring, and blow the others fall. Al. The world would wish it so, that will not patiently Endure the due rise of a vertuous man. As. If he be vertuous, what is the reason That men affect him nor, why is he lost Toth' generall opinion, and become Rather their hate than love? Al. I wonder you Will question it, aske a ground or reason Of men bred in this vile degenerate age; The most men are not good, and it agrees not With impious natures to allow whats honest, Tis an offence enough to be exalted To regall favours, great men are not safe In their owne vice, where good men by the hand Of Kings are planted to survey their workings; What man was ever fixt 'ith Sphere of honour, And precious to his Soveraigne, whose actions, Nay very soule was not expos'd to every Common and base dissection? and not onely That which in Nature hath excuse, and in Themselves in priviledg'd by name of frailtie, But even Vertues are made crimes, and doom'd Toth' fate of Treason. As. A bad age the while, I aske your pardon Sir, but thinkes your judgement, His love to Justice, and Corruptions hate Are true and hearty? Al. Iudge your selfe by this One argument, his hearty truth to all, For in the heart hath anger his wisest seate, And gainst unjust suites such brave anger fires him, That when they seeke to passe his place and power, Though mov'd; and urg'd by the other minion, Or by his greatest friends, and even the King Leade them to his allowance with his hand, First given in Bill, assign'd, even then his spirit, (In nature calme as any Summers evening) Puts up his Whole powers like a Winters sea, His bloud boyles over, and his heart even cracks At the injustice, and he teares the Bill, And would doe, were he for't to be torne in peeces. As. Tis brave I sweare. Al. Nay it is worthy your wonder That I must tell you further, theres no Needle In a Sunne Diall plac'd upon his steele In such a tender posture, that doth tremble The timely Diall being held amisse, And will shake ever, till you hold it right More tender than himsefe in any thing That he concludes in Iustice for the State: For as a fever held him, hee will shake When he is signing any things of weight, Least humane frailty should misguide his justice. As. You have declar'd him a most noble Iusticer. Al. He truely weighes and feeles Sir, what a charge The subjects livings are (being even their lives Laid on the hand of power,) which abus'd Though seene, blood flow not from the justice seate, Tis in true sence as grievous, and horrid. As. It argues nothing lesse, but since your Lord Is diversly reported for his parts, Whats your true censure of his generall worth, Vertue and Iudgement. Al. As of a Picture wrought to opticke reason, That to all passers by, seemes as they move Now woman, now a Monster, now a Divell, And till you stand, and in a right line view it, You cannot well judge what the maine forme is, So men that view him but in vulgar passes Casting but laterall, or partiall glances, At what he is, suppose him weake, unjust, Bloody, and monstrous, but stand free and fast, And judge him by no more than what you know Ingenuously, and by the right laid line Of truth, he truely, will all stiles deserve Of wise, just, good, a man both soule and nerve. As. Sir, I must joyne in just beleefe with you, But whats his rivall the Lord high Constable? Al. As just, and well inclin'd when hee's himselfe, (Not wrought on with the counsells, and opinions Of other men) and the maine difference is, The Admirall is not flexible nor wonne To move one scruple, when he comprehends The honest tract and justnesse of a cause, The Constable explores not so sincerely The course hee runnes, but takes the minde of others (By name Iudiciall) for what his owne Iudgement, and knowledge should conclude. As. A fault In my apprehension, anothers knowledge Applied to my instruction, cannot equall My owne soules knowledge, how to informe Acts; The Sunnes rich radiance shot through waves most faire, Is but a shaddow to his beames ith' ayre, His beames that in the ayre we so admire, Is but a darkenesse to his flame in fire, In fire his fervour but as vapour flies To what his owne pure bosome rarifies: And the Almighty wisedom, having given Each man within himselfe an apter light To guide his acts, than any light without him (Creating nothing not in all things equall) It seemes a fault in any that depend On others knowledge, and exile their owne. Al. Tis nobly argued, and exemplified, But now I heare my Lord, and his young rivall Are to be reconcil'd, and then one light May serve to guide them both. As. I wish it may, the King being made first mover To forme their reconcilement, and enflame it With all the sweetnesse of his praise and honour. Al. See, tis dispatch'd I hope, the King doth grace it. Loud Musicke, and Enter Vshers before, the Secretary, Tresuror, Chancellor, Admirall, Constable hand in hand, the King following, others attend. Kin. This doth expresse the noblest fruit of peace. Cha. Which when the great begin, the humble end In joyfull imitation, all combining A gardian beyond the Thrigian knot Past wit to lose it, or the sword, be still so. Tre. Tis certaine Sir, by concord least things grow Most great, and flourishing like trees that wrap Their forehead in the skies, may these doe so. Kin. You heare my Lord, all that is spoke contends To celebrate with pious vote the attonement So lately, and so nobly made betweene you. Ad. Which for it selfe Sir, resolve to keepe Pure, and inviolable, needing none To encourage or confirme it, but my owne Love and allegiance to your sacred counsell. Kin. Tis good, and pleases, like my dearest health, Stand you firme on that sweete simplicitie. Con. Past all earth pollicie that would infringe it. Kin. Tis well, and answers all the doubts suspected. Enter one that whispers with the Admirall. And what moves this close message Phillip? Adm. My wives Father Sir, is closely come to Court. King. Is he come to the Court, whose aversation So much affects him, that he shunnes and flies it, What's the strange reason that he will not rise Above the middle region he was borne in? Adm. He saith Sir, tis because the extreame of height Makes a man lesse seeme to the imperfect eye Then he is truely, his acts envied more, And though he nothing cares for seeming, so His being just stand firme twixt heaven and him, Yet since in his soules jealousie, hee feares That he himselfe advanced, would undervalue Men placed beneath him, and their businesse with him, Since height of place oft dazles height of judgement, He takes his toppe-saile downe in such rough stormes, And apts his sailes to ayres more temperate. Kin. A most wise soule he has, how long shall Kings Raise men that are not wise till they be high: You haue our leave, but tell him Phillip wee Would have him neerer. Con. Your desires attend you. Enter another. Kin. We know from whence you come, say to the Queene; We were comming to her, tis a day of love And she seales all perfection. Exit Tre. My Lord, We must beseech your stay. Con. My stay? Cha. Our Counsells Have led you thus farre to your reconcilement, And must remember you, to observe the end At which in plaine I told you then wee aim'd at, You know we all urg'd the attonement, rather To enforce the broader difference betweene you, Then to conclude your friendshippe, which wise men Know to be fashionable, and priviledg'd pollicie, And will succeede betwixt you, and the Admirall As sure as fate, if you please to get sign'd A sute now to the King with all our hands, Which will so much increase his precise justice, That weighing not circumstances of politicke State, He will instantly oppose it, and complaine, And urge in passion, what the King will sooner Punish than yeeld too, and so render you In the Kings frowne on him, the onely darling, And mediate power of France. Con. My good Lord Chancellor, Shall I so late atton'd, and by the Kings Hearty and earnest motion, fall in peeces? Cha. Tis he, not you that breake. Tre. Ha not you patience To let him burne himselfe in the Kings flame? Cha. Come, be not Sir infected with a spice Of that too servile equitie, that renders Men free borne slaves, and rid with bits like horses, When you must know my Lord, that even in nature A man is Animall politicum, So that when he informes his actions simply He does in both 'gainst pollicie and nature, And therefore our soule motion is affirm'd To be like heavenly natures circular, And circles being call'd ambitious fines, We must like them become, ambitious ever, And endles in our circumventions; No tough hides limiting our cheverill mindes. Tre. Tis learnedly, and past all answer argued, Yare great, and must grow greater still, and greater, And not be like a dull and standing lake, That settles, putrifies, and chokes with mudde, But like a river gushing from the head, That windes through the undervailes, what checkes ore flowing Gets strength still of his course, Till with the Ocean meeting, even with him In sway, and title, his brave billowes move. Con. You speake a rare affection, and high soules, But give me leave great Lords, still my just thankes Remembred, in your counsells and direction, I seeking this way to confirme my selfe I undermine the columnes that support My hopefull glorious fortune, and at once Provoke the tempest, though did drowne my envie, With what assurance shall the King expect My faith to him, that breake it for another, He has engag'd our peace, and my revenge Forfits my trust with him, whose narrow sight Will penetrate through all our mists, could we Vaile our designe with clouds blacker than night; But grant this danger over, with what Iustice, Or satisfaction to the inward Iudge, Shall I be gultie of this good mans ruine, Though I may still the murmuring tongues without me, Loud conscience has a voyce to shadder greatnesse. Secr. A name to fright, and terrifie young statists, There is necessitie my Lord, that you Must lose your light, if you ecclipse not him, Two starres so Lucide cannot shine at once In such a firmament, and better you Extinguish his fires, then be made his fuell, And in your ashes give his flame a Trophy. Cha. My Lord, the league that you have vow'd of friendship, In a true understanding not confines you, But makes you boundlesse, turne not edge at such A liberty, but looke to your owne fortune; Secure your honour, a Precisian, In state, is a rideculous miracle Friendship is but a visor, beneath which A wise man laughes to see whole families Ruinde, upon whose miserable pile He mounts to glory, Sir you must rësolve To use any advantage. Con. Misery Of rising Statesmen I must on, I see That 'gainst the politicke, and priviledg'd fashion, All justice 'tasts but affectation. Cha. Why so? we shall do good on him ith' end. Exeunt. Enter Father and the Admirall. Adm. You are most welcome. Fa. I wish your Lordships safetie, Which whilst I pray for, I must not forget To urge agen the wayes to fixe you where No danger has accesse to threaten you. Adm. Still your old argument, I owe your love fort. Fa. But fortified with new and pregnant reasons, That you should leave the Court. Ad. I dare not Sir. Fa. You dare be undone then. Ad. I should be ingratefull To such a master, as no subject boasted To leave his service when they exact My chiefest dutie, and attendance Sir. Fa. Would thou wert lesse degraded from thy titles, And swelling offices, that will ith' end Engulfe thee past a rescue, I had not come So farre to trouble you at this time, but that I doe not like the loud tongues o' the world, That say the King has tane another favorite, The Constable a gay man, and a great, With a hugh traine of faction too, the Queene, Chancellor, Treasurer, Secretary, and An army of state warriers, whose discipline, Is sure, and subtile to confusion, I hope the rumour's false, thou art so calme. Adm. Report has not abus'd you Sir. Fa. It has not, And you are pleas'd, then you doe meane to mixe With unjust courses, the great Constable And you combining, that no suite may passe One of the graples of your eithers rape, I that abhorr'd, must I now entertaine A thought, that your so straight, and simple custome To render Iustice, and the common good, Should now be patch'd with pollicy, and wrested From the ingenious step you tooke, And hang Vpon the shoulders of your enemy To beare you out in what you shame to act. Adm. Sir, We both are reconciled. Fa. It followes then that both the acts must beare Like reconcilement, and if hee will now Maligne and mallice you for crossing him Or any of his faction in their suites, Being now atton'd, you must be one in all, One in corruption, and twixt you two millstones New pickt, and put together, must the graine Of good mens needfull meanes to live, be ground Into your choking superfluities; You both too rich, they ruinde. Adm. I conceive Sir Wee both may be enrich'd, and raise our fortunes Even with our places in our Soveraignes favour: Though past the height of others, yet within The rules of Law and Iustice, and approove Our actions white and innocent. Fa. I doubt it While inforc'd shew perhaps, which will I feare Prove in true substance but a Millers whitenesse, More sticking in your clothes then conscience. Adm. Your censure here in tasts some passion Sir, And I beseech you nourish better thoughts, Then to imagine that the Kings meere grace Sustaines such prejudice by those it honours; That of necessitie we must pervert it With passionate enemies, and ambitious boundlesse Avarice, and every licence incident To fortunate greatnesse, and that all abuse it For the most impious avarice of some. Fa. As if the totall summe of favorites frailties Affected not the full rule of their Kings In their owne partially disposed ambitions, And that Kings doe no hazard infinitely In their free realties of rights and honours, Where they leave much for favourites powers to order. Adm. But wee have such a master of our King In the Imperiall art, that no power flies Out of his favour, but his policie ties A criance to it, to containe it still; And for the reconcilement of us Sir, Never were two in favour, that were more. One in all love of Iustice, and true honour, Though in the act and pro edition Pehaps we differ. Howsoever yet One beame us both creating, what should let That both our soules should both one mettle beare, And that one stampe, one word, one character. Fa. I could almost be won to be a Courtier, Theres some thing more in's composition, Then ever yet was favourites. Enter a Courtier. Whats hee? Cour. I bring your Lordship a sign'd bill, to have The addition of your honor'd hand, the counsell Have all before subscribed, and full prepar'd it. Ad. It seemes then they have weigh'd the importance of it, And know the grant is just. Cour. No doubt my Lord, Or else they take therein the Constables word, It being his suite, and his power having wrought The King already to appose his hand. Adm. I doe not like his working of the King, For if it be a suite made knowne to him, And fit to passe, he wrought himselfe to it, However my hand goes to no such grant, But first I'le know and censure it my selfe. Cour. A he, if thou beest goddesse of contention That Iove tooke by the haire, and hurl'd from heaven Assume in earth thy empire, and this bill Thy firebrand make to turne his love, thus tempted Into a hate, as horrid as thy furies. Adm. Does this heare title of his Lordships suite? Cour. It does my Lord, and therefore he beseech'd The rather your dispatch. Adm. No thought the rather, But now the rather all powers against it, The suite being most injust, and he pretending In all his actions justice, on the sudden After his so late vow not to violate it, Is strange and vile, and if the King himselfe Should owne and urge it, I would stay and crosse it, For tis within the free power of my office, And I should straine his kingdome if I past it, I see their poore attempts, and giddy malice; Is this the reconcilement that so lately He vow'd in sacred witnesse of the King? Assuring me, he never more would offer To passe a suite unjust, which I well know This is, above all, and have often beene urg'd To give it passage, be you Sir the Judge. Fa. I wonot meddle With any thing of state, you knew long since. Adm. Yet you may heare it Sir. Fa. You wonot urge My opinion then, go to. Adm. An honest merchant Presuming on our league of France with Spaine, Brought into Spaine a wealthy ship, to vent Her fit commodities to serve the country, Which, in the place of suffering their saile Were seas'd to recompence a Spanish ship Priz'd by a French man, ere the league was made, No suites, no letters of our Kings could gaine Our merchants first right in it, but his letters Vnreverently received, the Kings selfe scandall, Beside the leagues breach, and the foule injustice Done to our honest merchant, who endured all, Till some small time since (authoris'd by our counsell, Though not in open Court.) he made a ship out, And tooke a Spaniard, brings all home, and sues To gaine his full prov'd losse, full recompence Of his just prize, his prize is staid and ceaz'd, Yet for the Kings disposure, and the Spaniard Makes suite to be restor'd her, which this bill Would faine get granted, faining (as they hop'd) With my allowance, and way given to make Our Countrey mans in Spaine their absolute prize. Fa. Twere absolute injustice. Adm. Should I passe it. Fa. Passe life, and state before. Adm. If this would seeme His Lordships suite, his love to me, and justice Including plots upon me, while my simplenesse Is seriously vow'd to reconcilement; Love him good vulgars, and abhorre me still, For if I court your flatterie with my crimes, Heavens love before me fly, till in my tombe I sticke pursuing it, and for this bill, Thus say twas shiver'd, blesse us equall heaven! Exit. Fa. This could I cherish, now above his losse, You may report as much, the bill discharg'd Sir. Exeunt.</field>

Come, it concernes you not. Qu.

Kin. To doe what? Qu. To teare your crowne off. Kin. Come your language doth taste more Of rage and womanish flame than solid reason Against the Admirall, what commands of yours Not to your expectation obey'd By him, is ground of your so keene displeasure? Qu. Commands of mine? he is too great, and powerfull To stoope to my employment, a Colossus, And can stride from one Province to another By the assistance of those offices You have most confidently impos'd upon him, Tis he, not you take up he peoples eyes.

How sorts the businesse? how tooke the King The tearing of his bill? Al. Exceeding well, And seem'd to smile at all their grimme complaints, Gainst all that outrage to his highnesse hand, And said in plaine, he sign'd it but to try My Lords firme Iustice Fa. What a sweete King tis? Al. But how his rivall the Lord Constable Is labour'd by the Chancellor, and others to retort His wrong with ten parts more upon my Lord, Is monstrous? Fa. Neede hee their spurres? Al. I Sir, for hees afraid To beare himselfe too boldly in his braves Vpon the King (being newly entred Mynion) Since tis but patience sometime they thinke; Because the favor spending in two streames, One must runne low at length, till when he dare Take fire in such flame, as his faction wishes, But with wise feare containes himselfe, and so Like a greene faggot in his kindling smoakes, And where the Chancellor his chiefe Cyclops findes The fire within him apt to take, he blowes, And then the faggot flames, as never more The bellowes needed, till the too soft greenenesse Of his state habit, shewes his sappe still flowes, Above the solid timber, with which, then His blaze shrinkes head, he cooles, and smoakes agen. Fa. Good man he would be, wod the bad not spoile him. Al. True sir, but they still ply him with their arts, And as I heard have wrought him, personally To question my Lord with all the bitternesse The galls of all their faction can powre in, And such an expectation hangs upon't, Though all the Court as twere with child, and long'd To make a mirror of my Lords cleare blood, And therein see the full ebbe of his flood, And therefore if you please to counsell him You shall performe a fathers part.

My Lord retire, y'are way-laid in your walkes, Your friendes are all fallen from you, all your servants Suborn'd by all advantage to report Each word you whisper out, and to serve you With hat and knee, while other have their hearts. Adm, Much profit may my foes make of such servants, I love no enemy I have so well, To take so ill a bargaine from his hands. Al. Their other oddes yet shun, all being combinde, And lodg'd in ambush ariv'd to doe you mischiefe By any meanes past feare of law, or soveraigne. Adm. I walke no desart, yet goe arm'd with that, That would give wildest beasts instincts to rescue, Rather then offer any force to hurt me; My innocence is, which is a conquering justice, As weares a shield, that both defends and fights. All. One against all the world. Adm. The more the oddes, The lesse the conquest, or if all the world Be thought an army fit to employ gainst one, That one is argued fit to fight gainst all; If I fall under them, this breast shall beare Their heape digested in my sepulchre, Death is the life of good men, let e'm come. Enter Constable, Chancellor, Treasurer, Secretary. Con. I thought my Lord our reconcilement perfect, You have exprest what sea of gall flow'd in you, In tearing of the bill I sent to allow. Adm. Dare you confesse the sending of that bill. Con. Dare, why not? Adm. Because it breake your oath Made in our reconcilement, and betrayes The honour, and the chiefe life of the King Which is his justice. Con. Betraies? Adm. No lesse, and that Ile prove to him. Omnes. You cannot. Trea. I would not wish you offer at an action So most impossibly, and much against The judgement, and favour of the King. Adm. His judgement nor his favour I respect, So I preserve his Iustice. Cha. Tis not Iustice, Which I'le prove by law, and absolute learning. Adm. All your great law, and learning are but words, When I plead plainely, naked truth, and deedes, Which though you seeke to fray with state, and glory, I'le shoote a shaft at all your globe of light, If lightning split it, yet twas high and right.

Con, I will— Exit. Cha. He cooles, we must not leave him, we have no Such engine to remove the Admirall. Exeunt. Enter King and the Admirall. Kin. I prethee Philip be not so severe To him I favour, tis an argument That may serve one day to availe your selfe, Nor Does it square with your so gentle nature, To give such fires of envie to your bloud; For howsoeuer out of love to Iustice, Your Iealousie of that doth so incense you, Yet they that censure it will say tis envy. Adm. I serve not you for them, but for your selfe, And that good in your Rule, that Iustice does you, And care not this what others say, so you Please but to doe me right for what you know. King. You will not doe your selfe right, why should I Exceede you to your selfe? Adm. My selfe am nothing Compar'd to what I seeke, tis justice onely The fount and flood, both of your strength and kingdomes. King. But who knowes not, that extreame justice is (by all ruld lawes) the extreame of injurie, And must to you be so, the persons that Your passionate heate calls into question Are great, and many, and may wrong in you Your rights of kinde, and dignities of fortune, And I advanc'd you not to heape on you Honours, and fortunes, that by strong hand now Held up, and over you, when heaven takes off That powerfull hand 'should thunder on your head, And after you crush your surviving seedes. Adm. Sir, your regards to both are great, and sacred, But if the innocence, and right that rais'd me And meanes for mine, can finde no friend hereafter Of him that ever lives, and euer seconds All Kings just bounties with defence, and refuge In just mens races, let my fabricke ruine, My stocke want sap, my branches by the roote Be torne to death, and swept with whirlewindes out. King. For my love no relenting. Adm. No my leige, Tis for your love, and right that I stand out. King. Be better yet advis'd. Adm. I cannot Sir Should any Oracle become my counsell, For that I stand not out, thus of set will, Or pride of any singular conceite, My enemies, and the world may clearely know, I taste no sweetes to drowne in others gall, And to affect in that which makes me lothed, To leave my selfe and mine expos'd to all The dangers you propos'd, my purchas'd honours, And all my fortunes in an instant lost, That mony, cares, and paines, and yeares have gather'd, How mad were I to rave thus in my wounds, Vnlesse my knowne health felt in these forc'd issues Were sound, and fit, and that I did not know By most true proofes, that to become sincere With all mens hates, doth farre exceede their loves, To be as they are, mixtures of corruption? And that those envies that I see pursue me Of all true actions are the naturall consequents Which being my object, and my resolute choise Not for my good but yours, I will have justice. King. You will have justice, is your will so strong Now against mine? your power being so weake Before my favour gave them both their forces Of all that ever shar'd in my free graces, You Philip Chabot a meane Gentleman Have not I rais'd you to a supremest Lord, And given you greater dignities than any? Adm. You have so. King. Well sed, and to spurre your dullnesse With the particulars to which I rais'd you, Have not I made you first a Knight of the Order, Then Admirall of France, then Count Byzanges, Lord, and Livetenant generall of all My country, and command of Burgady; Livetenant generall likewise of my sonne Daulphine, and heire, and of all Normandy, And of my chiefely honor'd privy Counsell, And cannot all these powers weigh downe your will? Adm. No Sir, they were not given me to that end, But to uphold my will, my will being just. King. And who shall judge that Justice, you or I? Adm. I Sir, in this case your royall thoughts are fitly Exempt from every curious search of one, You have the generall charge with care of all. Kin. And doe not generalls include particulars? May not I Iudge of any thing compriz'd In your particular as well as you? Adm. Farre be the misery from you, that you may, My cares, paines, broken sleepe therein made more Than yours should make me see more, and my forces Render of better judgement. King. Well Sir, grant Your force in this my odds in benefits Paid for your paines, put in the other scale, And any equall holder of the ballance Will shew my merits hoist up yours to aire In rule of any doubt or deed betwixt us. Adm. You merit not of me for benefits More than my selfe of you for services. King. Ist possible. Adm. Tis true. King. Stand you on that? Adm. I to the death and will approve to all men. Kin. I am deceiv'd, but I shall finde good Judges That will finde difference. Adm. Finde them being good. King. Still so? what if conferring My bounties, and your services to sound them, We fall foule on some licences of yours, Nay, give me therein some advantage of you. Adm. They cannot. King. Not in sifting their severe discharges Of all your offices? Adm. The more you sift The more you shall refine mee. King. What if I Grant out against you a commission Ioyn'd with an extraordinary processe To arrest, and put you in lawes hands for triall. Adm. Not with lawes uttermost. King. Ile throw the dice. Adm. And Ile endure the chance, The dice being square. Adm. Repos'd in dreadlesse confidence, and conscience, That all your most extreames shall never reach, Or to my life, my goodes or honours breach. King. Was ever heard so fine a confidence? Must it not prove presumption, and can that Scape brackes and errors in your search of law, I prethee weigh yet, with more soule than danger, And some lesse passion. Adm. Witnesse heaven, I cannot. Were I dissolv'd, and nothing else but soule. King. Beshrew my blood, but his resolves amaze me; Was ever such a Iustice in a subject; Of so much office left to his owne swinge That left to law thus, and his Soveraignes wrath, Could stand cleare spight of both? let reason rule it Before it come at law, a man so rare In one thing cannot in the rest be vulgar, And who sees you not in the broad high-way The common dust up in your owne eyes, beating In quest of riches, honours, offices, As heartily in shew as most beleeve, And he that can use actions with the vulgar, Must needes embrace the same effects &amp; cannot informe him Whatsoever he pretends, use them with such Free equitie, as fits one just and reall, Even in the eyes of men, nor stand at all parts So truly circular, so sound, and solid, But have his swellings out, his crackes and crannies, And therefore in this reason, before law Take you to her, least you affect and flatter Your selfe with mad opinions. Adm. I were mad Directly Sir, if I were yet to know Not the sure danger, but the certaine ruine Of men shot into law from Kings bent brow, There being no dreame from the most muddie braine Vpon the foulest fancie, that can forge More horrour in the shaddowes of meere fame, Then can some Lawyer in a man expos'd To his interpretation by the King, But these grave toyes I shall despise in death, And while I live will lay them open so (My inocence laid by them) that like foiles They shall sticke of my merits tenne times more, And make your bounties nothing, for who gives And hits ith teeth, himselfe payes with the glory For which he gave, as being his end of giving, Not to crowne merits, or doe any good, And so no thankes is due but to his glory. King. Tis brave I sweare. Adm. No Sir, tis plaine, and rude But true, and spotlesse, and where you object My hearty, and grosse vulgar love of riches, Titles, and honours, I did never seeke them For any love to them, but to that justice You ought to use in their due gift to merits, To shew you royall, and most open handed, Not using for hands talons, pincers, grapples; In whose gripes, and upon-whose gord point, Deserts hang sprawling out their vertuous limbs, King. Better and better. Adm. This your glory is My deserts wrought upon no wretched matter, But shew'd your royall palmes as free, and moist, As Ida, all enchast with silver springs, And yet my merit still their equall sings. King. Sing till thou sigh thy soule out hence, and leave us. Adm. My person shall, my love and faith shall never. King. Perish thy love, and faith, and thee for ever; Whose there? Enter Asall. Let one goe for the Chancellor. Asa. He's here in Court Sir. King. Haste and send him hither, This is an insolence I never met with, Can one so high as his degrees ascend, Clime all so free, and without staine? My Lord Enter Chancellor. Chancellor, I send for you about a service Of equall price to me, as if againe My ransome came to me from Pavian thraldome, And more, as if from forth a subjects fetters, The worst of servitudes my life were rescued. Cha. You fright me with a Prologue of much trouble. King. Me thinkes it might be, tell me out of all Your famous learning, was there ever subject Rais'd by his Soveraignes free hand from the dust, Vp to a height above Ayres upper region, That might compare with him in any merit That so advanc'd him? and not shew in that Grosse over-weening worthy cause to thinke There might be other over-sights excepted Of capital nature in his sifted greatnesse. Chan. And past question Sir, for one absur'd thing granted, A thousand follow. King. You must then employ Your most exact, and curious art to explore A man in place of greatest trust, and charge, Whom I suspect to have abus'd them all, And in whom you may give such proud veines vent, As will be wray their boyling bloud corrupted Both gainst my crowne and life. Cha. And may my life Be curst in every act, If I explore him not to every finer. King. It is my Admirall. Cha. Oh my good Leige You tempt, not charge me with such search of him. King. Doubt not my heartiest meaning, all the troubles That ever mov'd in a distracted King, Put in just feare of his assaulted life Are not above my sufferings for Chabot. Cha. Then I am glad, and proud that I can cure you, For he's a man that I am studied in, And all his offices, and if you please To give authoritie. King. You shall not want it. Cha. If I discharge you not of that disease, About your necke growne, by your strange trust in him, With full discovery of the foulest treasons. King. But I must have all prov'd with that free justice. Cha. Beseech your Majestie doe not question it. King. About it instantly, and take me wholly Vpon your selfe. Cha. How much you grace your servant? King. Let it be fiery quicke. Cha. It shall have wings, And every feather shew the flight of Kings.</field>

Wif. I ha done, if the devotion to my Lord, Or pietie to his innocence have led me Beyond the awfull limits to be observ'd By one so much beneath your sacred person, I thus low crave your royall pardon Madam; I know you will remember in your goodnesse, My life blood is concern'd while his least veine Shall runne blacke and polluted, my heart fed With what keepes him alive, nor can there be A greater wound than that which strikes the life Of our good name, so much above the bleeding Of this rude pile wee carry, as the soule Hath excellence above this earth-borne frailty: My Lord, by the Kings will is lead already To a severe arraignement, and to Iudges, Will make no tender search into his tract Of life and state, stay but a little while, And France shall eccho to his shame or innocence, This suit I begge with teares, I shall have sorrow Enough to heare him censur'd foule and monstrous, Should you forbeare to antidate my sufferings. Qu. Your conscience comes about, and you incline To feare he may be worth the lawes condemning. Wif. I sooner will suspect the starres may lose Their way, and cristall heaven returne to Chaos; Truth sits not on her square more firme than he; Yet let me tell you Madam, were his life And action so foule as you have character'd, And the bad world expects, though as a wife Twere duty I should weepe my selfe to death, To know him falne from vertue, yet so much I a fraile woman love my King and Country, I should condemne him too, and thinke all honours The price of his lost faith more fatall to me, Than Cleopatra's aspes warme in my bosome, And as much boast their killing. Qu. This declares Another soule than was deliver'd me, My anger melts, and I beginne to pitty her, How much a Princes eare may be abus'd? Enjoy your happie confidence, at more leasure You may heare from us. Wif. Heaven preserve the Queene, And may her heart be charitable. Fa. You blesse and honour your unworthy servant. Qu. My Lord, did you observe this? Con. Yes great Madam, And read a noble spirit, which becomes The wife of Chabot, their great tie of marriage Is not more strong upon em, than their vertues. Qu. That your opinion? I thought your judgement Against the Admirall, doe you thinke him honest? Con. Religiously, a true, most zealous Patriot, And worth all royall favour. Qu. You amaze me, Can you be just your selfe then, and advance Your powers against him? Con. Such a will be farre From Montmoranzie, Pioners of state Have left no art to gaine me to their faction, And tis my misery to be plac'd in such A sphere where I am whirl'd by violence Of a fierce raging motion, and not what My owne will would encline me. I shall make This appeare Madam, if you please to second My free speech with the King. Qu. Good heaven protect all, Haste to the King, Iustice her swift wing needes, Tis high time to be good, when vertue bleedes. Exeunt. Enter Officers before the Chancellor, Iudges, the Proctor generall, whispering with the Chancellor, they take their places. To them Enter Treasurer and Secretary who take their places prepared on one side of the Court. To them The Captaine of the Guard, the Admirall following, who is plac'd at the barre. Cha. Good Mr. Proctor generall begin. Pro, It is not unknowne to you my very good Lords the Iudges, and indeed to all the world, for I will make short worke, since your honourable eares neede not to be enlarged, I speake by a figure with prolixe ennumeration how infinitly the King hath favoured this ill favoured Traitor; and yet I may worthily too insist and prove that no grace hath beene so large and voluminous, as this, that he hath appointed such upright Iudges at this time, and the chiefe of this Triumvirie, our Chancellor by name Poyet, which deriveth from the Greeke his, Etymology from Poyeni, which is to make, to create, to invent matter that was never extant in nature, from whence also is the name and dignitie of Poeta, which I will not insist upon, in this place, although I am confident his Lordshippe wanteth no facultie in making of Verses: but what addition I say is it to the honour of this Delinquent, that he hath such a Iudge, a man so learned, so full of equity, so noble, so notable in the progresse of his life, so innocent, in the manage of his office so incorrupt, in the passages of State so wise, in affection to his country so religious, in all his services to the King so fortunate, and exploring, as envie it selfe cannot accuse, or malice vitiate, whom all lippes will open to commend, but those of Philip; and in their hearts will erect Altars, and Statues, Columnes, and Obelishes, Pillars and Pyramids, to the perpetuitie of his name and memory. What shall I say? but conclude for his so great and sacred service, both to our King and Kingdome, and for their everlasting benefit, there may everlastingly be left here one of his Ioynes, one of his loynes ever remaine I say, and stay upon this Bench, to be the example of all Iustice, even while the North and South Starre shall continue. Cha. You expresse your Oratory Mr. Proctor, I ray come presently to the matter. Pro. Thus with your Lordships pardon, I proceede, and the first thing I shall glance at, will be worth your Lordships reflection, his ingratitude, and to whom? to no lesse person than a King, and to what King, his owne, and our generall Soveraigne Proh deum atque hominum fidem; a King, and such a King, the health, life, and soule of us all, whose very mention drawes this salt water from my eyes; for hee indeede is our eye, who wakes and watches for us when we sleepe, and who will not sleepe for him, I meane not sleepe, which the Philosophers call, a naturall cessation of the common and consequently of all the exterior sences, caused first and immediatly by a detension of spirits, which can have no communication, since the way is obstructed, by which these spirits should commearce, by vapours ascending from the stomacke to the head, by which evaporation the rootes of the nerves are filled, through which the annuall spirits, to be powred into the dwellings of the externall sences; but sleepe I take for death, which all know to be Ultima linea, who will not sleepe eternally for such a King as wee enjoy? If therefore in generall as hee is King of us all, all sharing and dividing the benefits of this our Soveraigne: none should be so ingratefull as once to murmure against him, what shall be said of the ingratitude more monstrous in this Chabot, for our Francis hath loved, not in generall &amp; in the croud with other subjects, but particularly this Philip advanc'd him to the supreme dignitie of a Statsman, lodg'd him in his very heart, yet Monstrum horrendum; even to this Francis hath Philip beene ingratefull. Brutus the loved sonne hath stabbed Cæsar with a Bodkin: Oh what brute may be compared to him? and in what particulars may this crime be exemplified; hee hath, as wee say, chopt Logicke with the King, nay to the very teeth of his Soveraigne advance his owne Gnat-like merits, and justified with Luciferous pride, that his services have deserved more than all the bounty of our Munificent King hath paid him. Cha. Observe that my Lords. Pro. Nay he hath gone further, and most traiterously hath committed outrage and impiety to the Kings owne hand, and royall character, which presented to him in a bill from the whole counsell, hee most violently did teare in peeces, and will doe the very body and person of your King, if our Justice make no timely prevention, and strike out the Serpentine teeth of this high and more than horrible monster. Tr. This was enforced home. Pro. In the next place I will relate to your honours his most cruell exactions upon the subject, the old vantcurriers of rebellions. In the yeare 15. 6. and 37. This oppressour, and this extortioner, under pretext of his due taxation, being Admirall impos'd upon certaine Fishermen, (observe I beseech you the circumstance of their persons, Fishermen) who poore Iohns were embarqued upon the cost of Normandy, and fishing there for Herrings (which some say is the King of Fishes) he impos'd I say twenty souse, and upon every boate sixe liuers, oh intollerable exaction! enough not onely to alienate the hearts of these miserable people from their King, which Ipso facto is high treason, but an occasion of a greater inconvenience, for want of due provision of fish among the subjects, for by this might ensue a necessitie of mortal sins, by breaking the religious fast upon Vigils, Embers, and other dayes commanded by sacred authority, besides the miserable rut that would follow, and perhaps contagion, when feasting and flesh should be licenced for every carnall appetite.—I could urge many more particulars of his dangerous insatiate and boundlesse Avarice, but the improvement of his estate in so few yeares, from a private Gentlemans fortune, to a great Dukes revenewes, might save our soveraigne therein an Orator to enforce and prove faulty even to gyantisme against heaven. Iudg. This is but a noise of words. Pro. To the foule outrages so violent, let us adde his Commissions granted out of his owne presum'd authoritie, his Majestie neither infround or respected his disloyalties, infidelities, contempts, oppressions, extortions, with innumerable abuses, offences, and forfeits, both to his Majesties most royall person, crowne, and dignitie, yet notwithstanding all these injustices, this unmatchable, unjust delinquent affecteth to be thought inculpable, and incomparable just; but alas my most learned Lord, none knowes better than your selves, how easie the sinceritie of Iustice is pretended, how hard it is to be performed, and how common it is for him that hath least colour of title to it, to be thought the very substance and soule of it, he that was never true scholler in the least degree, longs as a woman with child to be great with scholler she that was never with child longs Omnibus vijs &amp; modis to be got with child, and will weare a cushion to seeme with child, and hee that was never just, will fly in the Kings face to be counted just, though for all he be nothing, but just, a Traytor. Sec. The Admirall smiles. Jud. Answer your selfe my Lord. Adm. I shall, and briefely, The furious eloquence of my accuser hath Branch'd my offences hainous to the King, And then his subject, a most vast indictment, That to the King I have justified my merit, And services; which conscience of that truth, That gave my actions life when they are questioned, I ought to urge agen, and doe without The least part of injustice; for the Bill A foule, and most unjust one, and prefer'd Gainst the Kings honour, and his subjects priviledge, And with a policie to betray my office, And faith to both, I doe confesse I tore it, It being prest immodestly, but without A thought of disobedience to his name, To whose mention I bow, with humble reverence, And dare appeale to the Kings knowledge of me, How farre I am in soule from such a rebell, For the rest my Lord, and you my honour'd Iudges, Since all this mountaine all this time in labour With more than mortall fury gainst my life, Hath brought forth nought but some ridiculous vermine, I will not wrong my right, and innocence, With any serious plea in my reply, To frustrate breath, and fight with terrible shaddow That have beene forg'd, and forc'd against my state, But leave all, with my life to your free censures; Onely beseeching all your learned judgements Equall and pious conscience to weigh. Pro. And how this great and mighty fortune hath exalted him to pride is apparant, not onely in his braves and bearings to the King, the fountaine of all this increase, but in his contempt and scorne of the subject, his vast expences in buildings, his private bounties, above royall to souldiers and schollers, that he may be the Generall and Patron, and protector of armes and arts; the number of domesticke attendants, an army of Grashoppers and gay Butterflies able to devoure the Spring; his glorious wardrobes, his stable of horses that are prick'd with provender, and will enforce us to weede up our Vineyards to sow Oates for supply of their provision, his caroches shining with gold, and more bright than the chariot of the Sunne, wearing out the pavements; nay, he is of late so transcendently proud, that men must be his Mules, and carry him up and downe as it were in a Procession for men to gaze at him till their chines crackes with the weight of his insupportable pride, and who knowes but this may prove a fashion? But who grones for this? the subject, who murmure, and are ready to beginne a rebellion, but the tumultuous saylers, and water-rats, who tunne up and downe the citie, like an overbearing tempest, cursing the Admirall, who in duty ought to undoe himself for the generall satisfaction of his countrymen. Adm. The varietie, and wonder now presented To your most noble notice, and the worlds, That all my life and actions, and offices, Explor'd with all the hundred eyes of Law Lighted with lightning, shot out of the wrath Of an incenst, and commanding King, And blowne with foes, with farre more bitter windes, Then Winter from his Easterne cave exhailes, Yeh nothing found, but what you all have heard, And then consider if a peere of State, Should be expos'd to such a wild arraignement For poore complaints, his fame, faith, life, and honours Rackt for no more. Cha. No more? good heaven, what say My learned assistants. 1 Iu. My Lord, the crimes urg'd here for us to censure As capitall, and worth this high arraignement To me seeme strange, because they doe not fall In force of Law, to arraigne a Peere of State, For all that Law can take into her power To sentence, is the exaction of the Fishermen. 2 Iu. Here is no majesty violated, I consent to what my Brother has exprest. Cha, Breake then in wonder, My frighted words out of their forming powers, That you no more collect, from all these forfeits That Mr. Proctor generall hath opened, With so apparant, and impulsive learning, Against the rage and madnesse of the offender, And violate Majestie (my learned assistants) When Majesties affronted and defied, It being compar'd with? and in such an onset As leap'd into his throate? his life affrighting? Be justified in all insolence, all subjects If this be so considered, and insult Vpon your priviledg'd malice, is not Majestie Poyson'd in this wonder! and no felony set Where royaltie is rob'd, and Fie how it fights with Law, and grates upon Her braine and soule, and all the powers of Reason, Reporter of the processe, shew the sedule. No. Here my good Lord. 1. No altering it in us. 2. Farre be it from us Sir. Cha. Heres silken Iustice, It might be altered, mend your sentences. Both. Not wee my Lord. Cha. Not you? The King shall know You slight a duty to his will, and safety, Give me your pen, it must be capitall. 1. Make what you please my Lord, our doome shall stand. Cha. Thus I subscribe, now at your perills follow. Both. Perills my Lord? threates in the Kings free justice? Tre, I am amaz'd they can be so remisse. Sec. Mercifull men, pittifull Iudges certaine. 1. Subscribe, it matters nothing being constrain'd On this side, and on this side, this capitall I, Both which together put, import plaine Vi; And witnesse we are forc'd. 2. Enough, It will acquit us when we make it knowne, Our names are forc'd. Cha. If traiterous pride Vpon the royall person of a King Were sentenc'd unfelloniously before, Ile burne my Bookes and be a Iudge no more. Both. Here are our hands subscrib'd. Cha. Why so, it joyes me, You have reform'd your justice and your judgement, Now have you done like Iudges and learned Lawyers, The King shall thanke, and honour you for this. Notary read. No. We by his sacred Majestie appointed Judges, upon due triall, and examination Of Philip Chabot Admirall of France Declare him guiltie of high treasons, &amp;c. Cha. Now Captaine of the gaurd, secure his person, Till the King signifie His pleasure for his death, this day is happy To France, thus reskued from the vile devourer. A shoute within. Harke how the votes applaud their blest deliverance, You that so late did right and conscience boast, Heavens mercy now implore, the Kings is lost. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter King, Queene, and Constable. Kin. You raise my thoughts to wonder, that you Madam, And you my Lord, unite your force to pleade Ith' Admiralls behalfe, this is not that Language you did expresse, when the torne Bill Was late pretended to us, it was then Defiance to our high prerogative, The act of him whose proud heart would rebell And arm'd with faction, too soone attempt To teare my crowne off. Qu. I was ignorant Then of his worth, and heard but the report Of his accusers, and his enemies, Who never mention in his character Shadowes of any vertue in those men, They would depresse like Crowes, and carrion birds, They fly ore flowrie Meades, cleare Springs, faire Gardens, And stoope at carcasses; for your owne honour Pitty poore Chabot. King. Poore and a Colossus? What could so lately straddle ore a Province, Can he be fallen so low, and miserable, To want my pitty, who breakes forth like day, Takes up all peoples eyes, and admiration? It cannot be, he hath a Princely wife too. Qu. I interpose not often Sir, or presse you With unbecomming importunitie, To serve the profitable ends of others Conscience, and duty to your selfe inforce My present mediation, you have given The health of your owne state away, unlesse Wisedome in time recover him. King. If he proove No adulterate gold, triall confirmes his value. Qu. Although it hold in mettle gracious Sir, Such fiery examination, and the furnace May wast a heart thats faithfull, and together With that you call the feces, something of The precious substance may be hazarded. King. Why, you are the chiefe engine rais'd against him, And in the worlds Creede labour most to sinke him, That in his fall, and absence every beame May shine on you, and onely guild your fortune, Your difference is the ground of his arraignement, Nor were we unsollicited by you, To have your bill confirm'd, from that that spring Came all these mighty and impetuous waves, With which he now must wrastle if the strength Of his owne innocence can breake the storme, Truth wonot lose her servant, her wings cover him, He must obey his fate. Con. I would not have It lie upon my fame, that I should be Mentioned in Story his unjust supplanter For your whole Kingdome, I have beene abused, And made beleeve my suite was just and necessary, My walkes have not beene safe, my closet prayers, But some plot has pursued me, by some great ones Against your noble Admirall, they have frighted My fancy into my dreames with their close whispers, How to uncement your affections, And render him the fable, and the scorne Of France. Qu. Brave Montmorancie. King. Are you serious. Con. Have I a soule? or gratitude, to acknowledge My selfe your creature, dignified and honor'd By your high favours with an equall truth, I must declare the justice of your Admirall (In what my thoughts are conscious) and will rather Give up my claime to birth, title, and offices, Be throwne from your warme smile, the top and crowne Of subjects happinesse, then be brib'd with all Their glories to the guilt of Chabots ruine. King. Come, come, you over act this passion, And if it be not pollicie it tasts Too greene, and wants some counsell to mature it, His fall prepares your triumph. Con. It confirmes My shame alive, and buried will corrupt My very dust, make our house-genious grone, And fright the honest marble from my ashes: His fall prepare my triumph? turne me first A naked exile to the world. King. No more, Take heede you banish not your selfe, be wise, And let not too much zeale devoure your reason. Enter Asall. As. Your Admirall Is condemn'd Sir? King. Ha? strange! no matter, Leave us, a great man I see may be As soone dispatch'd, as a common subject. Qu. No mercy then for Chabot. Enter Wife and Father. Wif. From whence came That sound of Chabot? then we are all undone: Oh doe not heare the Queene, she is no friend To my poore Lord, but made against his life, Which hath too many enemies already. Con. Poore soule, shee thinkes the Queene is still against him, Who employeth all her powers to preserve him. Fa. Say you so my Lord? daughter the Queen's our friend. Wif. Why doe you mocke my sorrow! can you flatter Your owne griefe so, be just, and heare me sir, And doe not sacrifice a subjects blood To appease a wrathful Queene, let mercy shine Vpon your brow, and heaven will pay it backe Vpon your soule, be deafe to all her prayers. King. Poore heart, she knowes not what she has desir'd. Wif. I begge my Chabots life, my sorrowes yet Have not destroid my reason. King. He is in the power of my Lawes, not mine. Wif. Then you have no power, And are but the emptie shadow of a King, To whom is it resign'd? where shall I begge The forfeit life of one condemn'd by Lawes To partiall doome? King. You heare he is condemn'd then? Fa. My sonne is condemn'd sir. King. You know for what too. Fa. What the Iudges please to call it, But they have given't a name, Treason they say. Qu. I must not be denied. King. I must deny you. Wif. Be blest for ever fort. Qu. Grant then to her. King. Chabot condemn'd by law? Fa. But you have power To change the rigor, in your breast there is A Chancellor above it, I nere had A suite before, but my knees joyne with hers To implore your royall mercy to her Lord, And take his cause to your examination, It cannot wrong your Iudges, if they have Beene steer'd by conscience. Con. It will fame your Iustice. King. I cannot be prescrib'd, you kneele in vaine, You labour to betray me with your teares To a treason above his, gainst my owne Lawes, Looke to the Lady— Exeunt. Enter Asall. As. Sir the Chancellor. King. Admit him, leave us all. Enter Chancellor. How now my Lord? You have lost no time, and how thrive the proceedings. Cha. Twas sit my gracious Soveraigne, time should leave His motion made in all affaires beside, And spend his wings onely in speed of this. King. You have shew'd diligence, and whats become Of our most curious Iusticer, the Admirall? Cha. Condemn'd sir utterly, and all hands set To his conviction. King. And for faults most foule? Cha. More than most impious, but the applausive issue Strooke by the concourse of your ravish'd subjects For joy of your free Iustice, if there were No other cause to assure the sentence just Were proofe convincing. King. Now then he sees cleerely That men perceive how vaine his Iustice was, And scorne him for the foolish net be wore To hide his nakednesse; ist not a wonder That mens ambitions should so blinde their reason To affect shapes of honesty, and take pride Rather in seeming, then in being just. Cha. Seeming has better fortune to attend it Then being sound at heart, and vertuous. King. Professe all? nothing doe, like those that live By looking to the Lamps of holy Temples, Who still are busie taking off their snuffes, But for their profit sake will adde no oyle; So these will checke and sentence every fame, The blaze of riotous blood doth cast in others, And in themselves leave the fume most offensive, But he to doe this? more deceives my judgement Than all the rest whose nature I have sounded. Cha. I know Sir, and have prov'd it. King. Well my Lord To omit circumstance, I highly thanke you For this late service you have done me here, Which is so great and meritorious That with my ablest power I scarce can quit you. Cha. Your sole acceptance (my dread soveraigne) I more rejoyce in, than in all the fortunes That ever chanc'd me, but when may it please Your Highnesse to order the execution? The haste thus farre hath spar'd no pinions. King. No my Lord, your care Hath therein much deserv'd. Cha. But where proportion Is kept toth' end in things, at start so happy That end set on the crowne. King. Ile speede it therefore. Cha. Your thoughts direct it, they are wing'd. Exit. King. I joy this boldnesse is condemn'd, that I may pardon, And therein get some ground in his opinion By so much bounty as saves his life, And me thinks that weigh'd more, should sway the ballance Twixt me and him, held by his owne free Iustice, For I could never finde him obstinate In any minde he held, when once he saw Th' error with which he laboured, and since now He needs must feele it, I admit no doubt, But that his alteration will beget Another sence of things twixt him and me; Whose there? Enter Asall. Goe to the Captaine of my guard, and will him To attend his condemn'd prisoner to me instantly. As. I shall sir. Enter Treasurer &amp; Secretary. King. My Lords, you were spectators of our Admirall. Tre. And hearers too of his most just conviction, In which we witnest over-weight enough In your great bounties, and as they there were weigh'd With all the feathers of his boasted merits. King. Has felt a scorching triall, and the test (That holds fires utmost force) we must give mettalls That will not with the hammer, and the melting Confesse their truth, and this same sence of feeling (Being ground to all the sences) hath one key More than the rest to let in through them all The mindes true apprehension, that thence takes Her first convey'd intelligence. I long To see this man of confidence agen: How thinke you Lords, will Chabot looke on mee, Now spoild of the integrity, he boasted? Sec. It were too much honour to vouchsafe your sight. Tr. No doubt my Leigh, but he that hath offended In such a height against your crowne and person, Will want no impudence to looke upon you. Enter Asall, Captaine, Admirall. Cap. Sir, I had charge given me by this Gentleman To bring your condemn'd prisoner to your presence. King, You have done well, and tell the Queene, and our Lord Constable we desire their presence, bid Our Admiralls Lady, and her father too Attend us here, they are but new withdrawne. As. I shall sir! Tre. Doe you observe this confidence? He stands as all his triall were a dreame. Sec. Hele finde the horrour waking the King's troubled; Now for a thunder-clap: the Queene and Constable. Enter Queene, Constable, Wife and Father. Tr. I doe not like their mixture. King, My Lord Admirall, You made it your desire to have this triall That late hath past upon you; And now you seele how vaine is too much faith And flattery of your selfe, as if your brest Were proofe gainst all invasion, tis so slight You see it lets in death, whats past, hath beene To satisfie your insolence, there remaines That now we serve our owne free pleasure, therefore By that most absolute power, with which all right Puts in my hands, these issues turnes, and changes, I here in eare of all these, pardon all Your faults and forfeits, whatsoever sensur'd, Againe advancing, and establishing Your person in all fulnesse of that state That ever you enjoy'd before th' attainder. Tre. Wonderfull, pardon'd! Wif. Heaven preserve the King. Qu. Who for this will deserve all time to honour him. Con. And live Kings best example. Fa. Sonne yare pardon'd, Be sure you looke hereafter well about you. Adm. Vouchsafe great Sir to assure me what you said, You nam'd my pardon. King. And agen declare it, For all crimes past, of what nature soever. Adm. You cannot pardon me Sir. King. How's that Philip? Adm. It is a word carries too much relation To an offence, of which I am not guilty, And I must still be bold where truth still armes, In spight of all those frownes that would deject me To say I neede no pardon. King. Ha, howes this? Fa. Hees mad with over-joy, and answers nonsence. King. Why, tell me Chabot, are not you condemn'd? Adm. Yes, and that justifies me much the more, For whatsoever false report hath brought you, I was condemn'd for nothing that could reach To prejudice my life, my goods or honour, As first in firmenesse of my conscience, I confidently told you, not alas Presuming on your slender thred of favour, Or pride of fortunate and courtly boldnesse, But what my faith and justice bade me trust too, For none of all your learned assistant Judges, With all the malice of my crimes could urge, Or felony or hurt of sacred power. King. Doe any heare this, but my selfe? My Lords, This man still justifies his innocence, What prodigies are these? have not our Lawes Past on his actions, have not equall Iudges Certified his arraignement, and him guilty Of capitall Treason? and yet doe I heare Chabot accuse all these, and quit himselfe. Tr. It does appeare distraction sir. King. Did we Seeme so indulgent to propose our free And royall pardon without suite or prayer, To meete with his contempt? Sec. Vnhear'd of impudence! Ad. I were malicious to my selfe, and desperate To force untruths upon my soule, and when Tis cleare, to confesse a shame to exercise Your pardon sir, were I so foule and monstrous As I am given to you, you would commit A sinne next mine, by wronging your owne mercy To let me draw out impious breath, it will Release your wonder, if you give command To see your processe, and if it prove other Than I presume to informe, teare me in peeces. King. Goe for the Processe, and the Chancellor, With the assistant Iudges. I thanke heaven Exit As. That with all these inforcements of distraction My reason stayes so cleare to heare, and answer, And to direct a message. This inversion Of all the loyalties, and true deserts That I beleev'd I govern'd with, till now In my choice Lawyers, and chiefe Counsellors Is able to shake all my frame of reason. Adm. I am much griv'd. King. No more, I doe incline To thinke I am abus'd, my Lawes betrai'd And wrested to the purpose of my Judges, This confidence in Chabot turnes my judgement, This was too wilde a way to make his merits Stoope and acknowledge my superior bounties, That it doth raise, and fixe e'm past my art, To shadow all the shame and forfeits mine. Enter Asall, Chancellor, Iudges. As. The Chancellor and Judges Sir. Tre. I like not This passion in the King, the Queene and Constable Are of that side. King. My Lord, you dare appeare then? Cha. Dare Sir, I hope. King. Well done, hope still, and tell me, Is not this man condemn'd? Cha. Strange question Sir, The processe will declare it, sign'd with all These my assistant brothers reverend hands To his conviction in a publike triall. King. You said for foule and monstrous facts prov'd by him. Cha. The very words are there sir. King. But the deedes I looke for sir, name me but one thats monstrous? Cha. His foule comparisons, and affronts of you, To me seem'd monstrous. King. I told you them sir, Nor were they any that your so vast knowledge, Being a man studied in him, could produce And prove as cleare as heaven, you warranted To make appeare such treasons in the Admirall, As never all Lawes, Volumes yet had sentenc'd, And France should looke on, having scap'd with wonder What in this nature hath beene cleerely prov'd In his arraignement. 1. Nothing that we heard In slendrest touch urg'd by your Advocate. King. Dare you affirme this too? 2. Most confidently. King, No base corruptions charg'd upon him. 1. None sir. Tr. This argues Chabot has corrupted him. Sec. I doe not like this. 1. The summe of all Was urg'd to prove your Admirall corrupt, Was an exaction of his officers, Of twenty souse taken from the Fishermen For every boate, and that fish'd the Normand coast. King. And was this all The mountaines, and the marvells promist me, To be in cleere proofe made against the life Of our so hated Admirall. Iud. All sir, Vpon our lives and consciences. Cha. I am blasted. King. How durst you then subscribe to his conviction. 1. For threats by my Lord Chancellor on the Bench, Affirming that your Majestie would have it Made capitall treason, or account us traitors. 2. Yet sir, we did put to our names with this Interposition of a note in secret In these two letters U, and I, to shew Wee were enforc'd to what we did, which then In Law is nothing. Fa. How doe you feele your Lordship, Did you not finde some stuffing in your head, Your braine should have beene purg'd. Cha. I fall to peeces, Would they had rotted on the Bench. King. And so you sav'd the peace of that high Court. Which otherwise his impious rage had broken, But thus am I by his malicious arts A parly rendred, and most tyrannous spurre To all the open course of his base envies, A forcer of my Iudges, and a thirst Of my nobilities blood, and all by one, I trusted to make cleere my love of Iustice. Cha. I beseech your Majestie, let all my zeale To serve your vertues, with a sacred value Made of your royall state, to which each least But shade of violence in any subject Doth provoke certaine death. King. Death on thy name And memory for ever, one command Our Advocate attend us presently. As. He waites here. King. But single death shall not excuse, thy skinne Torne ore thine eares, and what else can be inflicted If thy life with the same severity Dissected cannot stand so many fires. Sec. Tre. Be mercifull great Sir. King. Yet more amaze? Is there a knee in all the world beside That any humane conscience can let bow For him, yare traitors all that pitty him. Tr. This is no time to move. King. Yet twas my fault To trust this wretch, whom I knew fierce and proud With formes of tongue and learning, what a prisoner Is pride of the whole flood of man? for as A humane seede is said to be a mixture And faire contemperature extracted from All our best faculties, so the seede of all Mans sensuall frailty, may be said to abide, And have their confluence in onely pride, It stupifies mans reason so, and dulls True sence of any thing, but what may fall In his owne glory, quenches all the spirits That light a man to honour and true goodnesse. As. Your Advocate. Enter Advocate. King. Come hither. Adv. My most gracious Soveraigne. Adm. Madam you infinitely oblige our duty. Qu. I was too long ignorant of your worth my Lord, And this sweete Ladies vertue. Wif. Both your servants. Adm. I never had a feare of the Kings Iustice, And yet I Know not what creepes ore my heart, And leaves an ice beneath it, my Lord Chancellor, You have my forgivenesse, but implore heavens pardon For wrongs to equall justice, you shall want No charitie of mine to mediate To the King for you. Cha. Horrour of my soule Confounds my gratitude. Con. To me now most welcome. Adv. It was my allegiance sir, I did enforce, But by directions of your Chancellor, It was my office to advance your cause Gainst all the world, which when I leave to execute, Flea me, and turne me out a most raw Advocate. King. You see my Chancellor. Adv. He has an ill looke with him. King. It shall be your province now, on our behalfe To urge what can in justice be against him, His riot on our Lawes, and corrupt actions Will give you scope and field enough. Adv. And I Will play my law prize, never feare it sir, He shall be guilty of what you please, I am studied In him sir, I will squeeze his villanies, And urge his acts so whom into his bowells, The force of it shall make him hang himselfe, And save the Lawes a labour. King. Iudges, for all The poisonous outrage, that this viper spilt On all my royall freedome and my Empire, As making all but servants to his malice, I will have you revise the late arraignement, And for those worthy reasons, that already Affect you for my Admiralls acquitall Employ your justice on this Chancellor, away with him, Arrest him Captaine of my guard to answer All that due course of Law against him can Charge both his Acts and life. Cap. I doe arrest thee Poyet Lord Chancellor in his Highnesse name, To answer all that equall course of Law Can charge thy acts and life with. Cha. I Obey. King. How false a heart corruption has, how base Without true worth are all these earth-bred glories? Oh blessed justice, by which all things stand, That stills the thunder, and makes lightning finke Twixt earth and heaven amaz'd, and cannot strike, Being prov'd so now in wonder of this man, The object of mens hate, and heavens bright love; And as in cloudy dayes, we see the Sunne Glide over turrets, temples, richest fields, All those left darke, and slighted in his way, And on the wretched plight of some poore shed, Powres all the glories of his golden head; So heavenly vertue, on this envied Lord, Points all his graces, that I may dinstinguish Him better from the world. Tre. You doe him right. King. But away Iudges, and pursue the arraignement Of this polluted Chancellor with that swiftnesse, His fury wing'd against my Admirall, And be you all, that sate on him compurgators Of me against this false Iudge. Iud. We are so. King. Be you two joyn'd in the commission, And nothing urg'd but justly, of me learning This one more lesson out of the events Of these affaires now past, that whatsoever Charge or Commission Iudges have from us, They ever make their ayme ingenuous Iustice, Not partiall for reward, or swelling favour, To which if your King steere you, spare to obey; For when his troubled blood is cleere, and calme, He will repent that he pursued his rage, Before his pious Law, and hold that Iudge Vnworthy of his place, that lets his censure Flote in the waves of an imagin'd favour, This shipwracks in the haven, and but wounds Their consciences that sooth the soone ebb'd humours Of their incensed King. Con., Tre. Royall and sacred. King. Come Philip, shine thy honour now for ever, For this short temporall ecclipse it suffer'd By th' interpos'd desire I had to try thee, Nor let the thought of what is past afflict thee, For my unkindnesse, live still circled here, The bright intelligence of our royall spheere. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Enter Queene, Constable, Father. Qu. The Admirall sicke? Fa. With danger at the heart, I came to tell the King. Con. He never had More reason in his soule, to entertaine All the delights of health. Fa. I feare my Lord, Some apprehension of the Kings unkindnesse, By giving up his person, and his offices To the Lawes gripe and search, is ground of his Sad change, the greatest foules are thus oft wounded, If he vouchsafe his presence, it may quicken His fast decaying spirits, and prevent The hasty ebbe of life. Qu. The King is now Fraught with the joy of his fresh preservation, The newes so violent, let into his eare, May have some dangerous effect in him, I wod not counsell sir to that. Fa. With greater reason I may suspect they'le spread my Lord, and as A river left his curl'd and impetuous waves Over the bankes, by confluence of streames That sill and swell her channell, for by this time He has the addition of Allegres suffering, His honest servant, whom I met though feeble And worne with torture, going to congratulate His Masters safetie. Qu. It seemes he much Affected that Allegre. Con. There will be But a sad interview and dialogue. Qu. Does he keepe his bed? Fa. In that alone He shewes a fortitude, he will move, and walke He sayes while his owne strength or others can Support him, wishing he might stand and looke His destiny in the face at the last summon, Not sluggishly exhaile his soule in bed, With indulgence, and nice flattery of his limbs. Qu. Can he in this shew spirit, and want force To wrastle with a thought? Fa. Oh Madam, Madam, We may have proofe against the sword, and tyranny Of boysterous warre that threatens us, but when Kings froune, a Cannon mounted in each eye, Shoote death to apprehension, ere their fire And force approach us. Enter King. Con. Here's the King. Qu. No words To interrupt his quiet, Fa. Ile begon then. King. Our Admiralls father! call him backe. Qu. I wonot stay to heare e'm. Exit. Con. Sir, be prudent, And doe not for your sonne fright the Kings health. Exit. King. What, ha they left us? how does my Admirall? Fa. I am forbid to tell you sir. King. By whom. Fa. The Queene and my Lord Constable. King. Are there Remaining seedes of faction? have they soules Not yet convinc'd ith truth of Chabots honour, Cleare as the christall heaven, and bove the reach Of imitation. Fa. Tis their care of you, And no thought prejudiciall to my sonne. King. Their care of me? How can the knowledge of my Admiralls state Concerne their feares of me, I see their envie Of Chabots happinesse, whose joy to be Rendr'd so pure and genuine to the world Doth grate upon their conscience and affright 'em; But let 'em vexe, and bid my Chabot still Exalt his heart, and triumph, he shall have The accesse of ours, the kingdome shall put on Such joyes for him as she would bost to celebrate Her owne escape from ruine. Fa. He is not in state to heare my sad newes I perceive. King. That countenance is not right, it does not answer What I expect, Say, how is my Admirall? The truth upon thy life. Fa. To secure his, I would you had. King. Ha? Who durst oppose him? Fa. One that hath power enough hath practised on him And made his great heart stoope. King. I will revenge it With crushing, crushing that rebellious power to nothing. Name him. Fa. He was his friend. King. A friend to malice, his owne blacke impostume Burne his blood up, what mischiefe hath ingendred New stormes? Fa. Tis the old tempest. King. Did not we Appease all horrors that look'd wilde upon him? Fa. You drest his wounds I must confesse, but made No cure, they bleede a fresh, pardon me sir, Although your conscience have clos'd too soone, He is in danger, and doth want new surgerie Though he be right in fame, and your opinion, He thinkes you were unkinde. King. Alas poore Chabot, Doth that afflict him. Fa. So much, though he strive With most resolv'd and Adamantine nerves, As ever humane fire in flesh and blood, Forg'd for example, to beare all, so killing The arrowes that you shot were (still your pardon) No Centaures blood could rancle so. King. If this Be all, ile cure him, Kings retaine More Balsome in their soule then hurt in anger. Fa. Farre short sir, with one breath they uncreate, And Kings with onely words more wounds can make Then all their kingdome made in balme can heale, Tis dangerous to play to wilde a descant On numerous vertue, though it become Princes To assure their adventures made in every thing, Goodnesse confin'd within poore flesh and blood, Hath but a queazie and still sickly state, A musicall hand should onely play on her Fluent as ayre, yet every touch command. King. No more, Commend us to the Admirall, and say, The King will visite him, and bring health. Fa. I will not doubt that blessing, and shall move Nimbly with this command. Exeunt. Enter Officers before, Treasurer, Secretary, and Iudges, attended by Petitioners, the Advocate also with many papers in his hand, they take their places. The Chancellor with a guard, and plac'd at the Barre. Tre. Did you beleeve the Chancellor had beene So foule? Sec. Hee's lost toth' people, what contempts They throw upon him? but we must be wise. 1 Iud. Were there no other guilt, his malice shew'd Vpon the Admirall, in orebearing justice, Would well deserve a sentence. Tre. And a deepe one. 2 Iud. If please your Lordships to remember that Was specially commended by the King, As being most blemish to his royall person, And the free justice of his state. Tre. Already He has confest upon his examinations Enough for sensure, yet to obey forme— Mr. Advocate if you please— Adv. I am ready for your Lordships: It hath beene said, and will be said agen, and may truely be justified, Omnia ex lite fieri. It was the position of Philosophers, and now proved by a more Phylosophycall sect, the Lawyers, that Omnia ex lite fiaxt, we are all made by Law, made I say, and worthily if we be just, if we be unjust, marr'd, though in marring some, there is necessitie of making others, for if one fall by the Law, tenne to one but another is exalted by the execution of the Law, since the corruption of one must conclude the generation of another, though not alwayes in the same profession; the corruption of an Apothecary, may be the generation of a Doctor of Physicke; the corruption of a Citizen may beget a Courtier, &amp; a Courtier may very well beget an Alderman, the corruption of an Alderman may be the generation of a Country Iustice, whose corrupt ignorance easily may beget a tumult, a tumult may beget a Captaine, and the corruption of a Captaine may beget a Gentleman-Vsher, and a Gentleman-Vsher may beget a Lord, whose wit may beget a Poet, and a Poet may get a thousand pound a yeare, but nothing without corruption. Tre. Good Mr. Advocate be pleased to leave all digressions, and speake of the Chancellor. Adv. Your Lordship doth very seasonably premonish, and I shall not neede to leave my subject corruption, while I discourse of him, who is the very fenne and stigian abisse of it, five thousand and odde hundred foule and impious corruptions, for I will be briefe; have beene found by severall examinations, and by oathes prov'd against this odious and polluted Chancelor, a man of so tainted, and contagious a life, that it is a miracle any man enjoyeth his nostrills, that hath lived within the sent of his offices; he was borne with teeth in his head, by an affidavit of his Midwife, to note his devouring, and hath one toe on his left foote crooked, and in the forme of an Eagles talon, to foretell his rapacitie: What shall I say? branded, mark'd, and design'd in his birth for shame and obloquie, which appeareth further by a mole under his right eare, with only three Witches haires int, strange and ominous predictions of nature. Tre. You have acquainted your selfe but very lately With this intelligence, for as I remember Your tongue was guilty of no such character, When hee sat Iudge upon the Admirall, A pious incorrupt man, a faithfull and fortunate Servant to his King, and one of the greatest Honours that ever the Admirall received, was That he had so noble and just a Iudge, this must Imply a strange volubilitie in your tongue, or Conscience, I speake not to discountenance any Evidence for the King, but to put you in minde, Mr. Advocate that you had then a better opinion Of my Lord Chancellor. Adv. Your Lordship hath most aptly interpos'd, and with a word I shall easily satisfie all your judgements; He was then a Judge, and in Cathedra, in which he could not erre; it may be your Lordships cases, out of the chaire and seate of Iustice, he hath his frailties, is loos'ed and expos'd to the conditions of other humane natures; so every Iudge, your Lordships are not ignorant hath a kinde of priviledge while he is in his state, office and being, and although hee may quoad se, internally and privately be guilty of bribery of Iustice, yet quoad nos, and in publike he is an upright and innocent Iudge, we are to take no notice, nay, we deserved to suffer, if wee should detect or staine him; for in that we disparage the Office, which is the Kings, and may be our owne, but once remov'd from his place by just dishonour of the King, he is no more a Iudge but a common person, whom the law takes hold on, and wee are then to forget what hee hath beene, and without partialitie to strip and lay him open to the world, a counterfeit and corrupt Iudge, as for example, hee may and ought to flourish in his greatnesse, and breake any mans necke, with as much facilitie as a jeast, but the case being altered, and hee downe, every subject shall be heard, a Wolfe may be appareld in a Lambskinne; and if every man should be afraid to speake truth, nay and more than truth, if the good of the subject which are clients sometime require it, there would be no remove of Officers, if no remove no motions, if no motion in Court no heate, and by consequence but cold Termes; take away this moving, this removing of Iudges, the Law may bury it selfe in Buckram, and the kingdome suffer for want of a due execution; and now I hope your Lordships are satisfied. Tre. Most learnedly concluded to acquit your selfe. I Iud. Mr. Advocate, please you to urge for satisfaction Of the world, and clearing the Kings honour, how Injustly he proceeded against the Admirall. Adv. I shall obey your Lordship—So vast, so infinite hath beene the impudence of this Chancellor, not onely toward the subject, but even the sacred person of the King, that I tremble as with a Palsie to remember it. This man, or rather this monster, having power and commission trusted for the examination of the Lord Admirall, a man perfect in all honour and justice; indeede the very ornament and second flower of France, for the Flower de lis, is sacred and above all flowers, and indeede the best flower in our garden. Having used all wayes to circumvent his innocence by suborning and promising rewards to his betrayers, by compelling others by the cruelty of tortures, as nemely Mounsieur Allegre most honest and faithfull servant to his Lord, tearing and extending his sinewes upon the racke to force a confession to his purpose, and finding nothing prevaile upon the invincible vertue of the Admirall. Sec. How he would flatter him? Adv. Yet most maliciously proceeded to arraigne him; to be short against all colour of Iustice condemn'd him of high treasons; oh thinke what the life of man is, that can never be recompenced; but the life of a just man, a man that is the vigour and glory of our life and nation to be torne to death, and sacrifis'd beyond the mallice of common persecution. What Tiger of Hercanian breede could have beene so cruell? but this is not all? he was not guilty onely of murder, guilty I may say In foro cõsctieniæ, though our good Admirall was miraculously preserv'd, but unto this he added a most prodigious &amp; fearefull rape, a rape even upon Iustice it self, the very soule of our state, for the rest of the Iudges upon the Bench, venerable images of Austria, he most tyranously compel'd to set their hands to his most unjust sentence; did ever story remember the like outrage and in justice; what forfeit, what penalty can be enough to satisfie this transcendent offence? and yet my good Lords, this is but veniall to the sacriledge which now followes, and by him committed, not content with this sentence, not satisfied with horrid violence upon the sacred Tribunall, but hee proceedes and blasphemes the very name and honour of the King himselfe, observe that, making him the author and impulsive cause of all these rapines, justifying that he mov'd onely by his speciall command to the death, nay the murder of his most faithfull subject, translating all his owne blacke and damnable guilt upon the Kings heires, a traytor to his Country, first, he conspires the death of one whom the King loves, and whom every subject ought to honour, and then makes it no conscience to proclaime it the Kings act, &amp; by consequence declares him a murderer of his owne, and of his best subjects. Within An Advocate, an Advocate, teare him in peeces, Teare the Chancellor in peeces. Tre. The people have deepe sence of the Chancellors injustice. Sec. We must be carefull to prevent their mutiny. 1 Iud. It will become out wisedomes to secure the court And prisoner. Tre. Captaine of the guard. 2. What can you say for your selfe Lord Chancellor. Cha. Againe, I confesse all, and humbly fly to The royall mercy of the King. Tre. And this submission is the way to purchase it. Cha. Heare me great Iudges, if you have not lost For my sake all your charities, I beseech you, Let the King know my heart is full of penitence, Calme his high-going sea, or in that tempest I ruine to eternitie, oh my Lords, Consider your owne places, and the helmes You sit at, while with all your providence You steere, looke forth and see devouring quicksands, My ambition now is punish'd, and my pride Of state and greatnesse falling into nothing, I that had never time through vast employments To thinke of heaven, feele his revengefull wrath, Boyling my blood, and scorching up my entrills, There doomesday is my conscience blacke and horrid, For my abuse of Iustice, but no stings Prickt with that terrour as the wounds I made Vpon the pious Admirall, some good man Beare my repentance thither, he is mercifull, And may encline the King to stay his lightning Which threatens my confusion, that my free Resigne of title, office, and what else My pride look'd at, would buy my poore lives safety, For ever banish me the court, and let Me waste my life farre off in some Village. Adv. How? Did your Lordships note his request to you, he would direct your sentence to punish him with confining him to live in the country, like the Mouse in the Fable, that having offended to deserve death, beg'd he might be banished into a Parmisan. I hope your Lordships will be more just to the nature of his offences. Sec. I could have wish'd him fall on softer ground For his good parts. Tre. My Lord, this is your sentence for you high misdemeanours against his Majesties Iudges, for your unjust sentence of the most equall Lord Admirall, for many and foule corruptions and abuse of your office, and that infinite staine of the Kings person, and honour, we in his Majesties name, deprive you of your estate of Chancellor, &amp; declare you uncapeable of any judiciall office, &amp; besides condemne you in the sum of two hundred thousand crownes; whereof one hundred thousand to the King, and one hundred thousand to the Lord Admirall, and what remaineth of your estate to goe to the restitution of those you have injur'd, and to suffer perpetuall imprisonment in the Castle, so take him to your custody. Your Lordships have beene mercifull in his sentence. Exit. They have spar'd my life then, that some cure may bring, I spend it in my prayers for the King. Exeunt. Enter Admirall in his Gowne and Cap, his Wife. Adm. Allegre I am glad he hath so much strength, I prethee let me see him. Wif. It will but Enlarge a passion—my Lord hee'le come Another time and tender you his service. Adm. Nay then— Wif. Although I like it not, I must obey. Exit. Enter Allegre supported. Adm. Welcome my injur'd servant, what a misery Ha they made on thee? Al. Though some change appeare Vpon my body, whose severe affliction Hath brought it thus to be sustained by others, My hurt is still the fame in faith to you, Not broken with their rage. Adm. Alas poore man! Were all my joyes essentiall, and so mighty As the affected world beleeves I taste, This object were enough to unsweeten all, Though in thy absence I had suffering, And felt within me a strong sympathy, While for my sake their cruelty did vexe, And fright thy nerves with horrour of thy sence, Yet in this spectacle I apprehend More griefe than all my imagination Could let before into me; didst not curse me Vpon the torture? Al. Good my Lord, let not The thought of what I suffer'd dwell upon Your memory, they could not punish more Then what my duty did oblige to beare For you and Iustice, but theres some thing in Your lookes, presents more feare than all the mallice Of my tormentors could affect my soule with, That palenesse, and the other formes you weare, Would well become a guilty Admirall, and one Lost to his hopes and honour, not the man Vpon whose life the fury of unjustice Arm'd with fierce lightning, and the power of thunder, Can make no breach, I was not rack'd till now, Theres more death in that falling eye, than all Rage ever yet brought forth, what accident sir can blast, Can be so blacke and fatall to distract The calme? the triumph that should sit upon Your noble brow, misfortune could have no Time to conspire with fate, since you were rescued By the great arme of providence, nor can Those garlands that now grow about your forehead With all the poyson of the world be blasted. Adm. Allegre, thou dost beare thy wounds upon thee, In wide and spacious characters, but in The volumne of my sadnesse thou dost want An eye to reade an open force, hath torne Thy manly sinewes which sometime may cure The engine is not seene that wounds thy Master, Past all the remedy of art or time, The flatteries of Court, of fame or honours, Thus in the Sommer a tall flourishing tree, Transplanted by strong hand, with all her leaves And blooming pride upon her makes a shew Of Spring, tempting the eye with wanton blossome, But not the Sunne with all her amorous smiles, The dewes of mornings, or the teares of night, Can roote her fibers in the earth agen, Or make her bosome kinde, to growth and bearing, But the tree withers, and those very beames That once were naturall warmth to her soft verdure Dry up her sap and shoote a feaver through The barke and rinde, till she becomes a burthen To that which gave her life: so Chabot, Chabot, Al. Wonder in apprehension, I must Suspect your health indeede. Adm. No no, thou shanot Be troubled, I but stirr'd thee with a morrall, Thats empty containes nothing, I am well, See I can walke poore man, thou hast not strength yet. Al. What accident is ground of this distraction? Enter Admirall. Adm. Thou hast not heard yet whats become oth' Chancellor? Al. Not yet my Lord. Adm, Poore gentleman, when I thinke Vpon the King, I've balme enough to cure A thousand wounds, have I not Allegre? Was ever bountious mercy read in story, Like his upon my life, condemn'd for sacrifice By Law, and snatch'd out of the flame unlooked for, And unpetitioned? but his justice then That wod not spare whom his owne love made great, But give me up to the most cruell test Of Iudges, for some boldnesse in defence Of my owne merits, and my honest faith to him Was rare, past example. Enter Father. Fa. Sir, the King Is comming hither. Al. It will Become my duty sir to leave you now. Adm, Stay by all meanes Allegre, 'tshall concerne you, I'me infinitely honor'd in his presence. Enter King, Queene, Constable, and Wife. King. Madam be comforted, Ile be his Phisitian. Wif. Pray heaven you may. King. No ceremoniall knees, Give me thy heart, my deare, my honest Chabot, And yet in vaine I chalenge that tis here Already in my owne, and shall be cherish'd With care of my best life, violence Shall ravish it from my possession, Not those distempers that infirme my blood And spirits shall betray it to a feare, When time and nature joyne to dispossesse My body of a cold and languishing breath, No stroake in all my arteries, but silence In every faculty, yet dissect me then, And in my heart, the world shall read thee living, And by the vertue of thy name write there, That part of me shall never putrifie, When I am lost in all my other dust. Adm. You too much honour your poore servant sir, My heart dispares so rich a monument; But when it dies— King. I wonot heare a sound Of any thing that trenched upon death, He speakes the funerall of my crowne that prophesies So unkinde a fate, weele live and die together, And by that duty which hath taught you hitherto, All loyall and just services I charge thee, Preserve thy heart for me and thy reward, Which now shall crowne thy merits. Adm. I have found A glorious harvest in your favour sir, And by this overflow of royall grace, All my deserts are shadowes and flie from mee, I have not in the wealth of my desires, Enough to pay you now, yet you encourage me To make one suite. King. So soone as nam'd possesse it. Adm. You would be pleas'd take notice of this Gentleman, A Secretary of mine. Con. Mounsieur Allegre, He that was rack'd sir for your Admirall. Adm. His limbs want strength to tender their full duty, An honest man that suffers for my sake. King. He shall be deare to us, for what has past sir By the unjustice of our Chancellors power, Weele study to recompence, ith' meane time that office You exercis'd for Chabot we translate To our selfe, you shall be our Secretary. Al. This is An honour above my weake desert, and shall Oblige the service of my life to satisfie it. Adm. You are gracious, and in this act have put All our complaints to silence, you Allegre, Enter Tresuror, Secretary. Cherish your health, and feeble limbs which cannot Without much prejudice be thus employ'd; All my best wishes with thee. Al. All my prayers Are duties to your Lordship— Exit. King. Tis too little, Can forfeit of his place, wealth, and a lasting Imprisonment purge his offences to Our honest Admirall, had our person beene Exempted from his mallice, he did persecute The life of Chabot with an equall wrath, You should have powr'd death on his treacherous head, I revoke all your sentences, and make Him that was wrong'd full Master of his destiny, Be thou his judge. Adm. O farre be such injustice, I know his doome is heavie, and I begge Where mercy may be let into his sentence For my sake you would soften it, I have Glory enough to be set right in yours, And my deare countries thought, and by an act With such apparent notice to the world. King. Expresse it in some joy then. Adm. I will strive To shew that pious gratitude to you but— Kng. But what Adm. My frame hath lately sir beene tane a peeces, And but now put together, the least force Of mirth will shake and unjoynt all my reason, Your patience royall sir. King. Ile have no patience, If thou forget the courage of a man. Adm. My strength would flatter me. King. Phisitians, Now I begin to feare his apprehension, Why how is Chabots spirit falne? Qu. Twere best He were convei'd to his bed. Wif. How soone turn'd widdow. Adm. Who would not wish to live to serve your goodnes. Stand from me, you betray me with your feares, The plummets may fall off that hang upon My heart, they were but thoughts at first, or if They weigh me downe to death, let not my eyes Close with another object then the King, Let him be last I looke on. King. I would not have him lost for my whole Kingdome. Con. He may recover sir. King. I see it fall, For Iustice being the proppe of every Kingdome And mine broke, violating him that was The knot and contract of it all in him, It already falling in my eare, Pompey could heare it thunder, when the Senate And Capitoll were deafe, so heavens loud chiding, Ile have another sentence for my Chancellor, Vnlesse my Chabot live, In a Prince What a swift executioner is a frowne, Especially of great and noble soules; How is it with my Philip? Adm. I must begge One other boone. King. Vpon condition My Chabot will collect his scatter'd spirits, And be himselfe agen, he shall divide My Kingdome with me. Fa. Sweete King. Adm. I observe A fierce and kllling wrath engendred in you; For my sake, as you wish me strength to serve you, Forgive your Chancellor, let not the story Of Philip Chabot read hereafter draw A teare from any family, I beseech Your royall mercy on his life, and free Remission of all seasure upon his state, I have no comfort else. King. Endeavour But thy owne health, and pronounce generall pardon To all through France. Adm. Sir I must kneele to thanke you, It is not seal'd else, your blest hand live happy, May all you trust have no lesse faith then Chabot, Oh. Wif. His heart is broken. Fa. And kneeling sir, As his ambition were in death to shew The truth of his obedience. Con. I feard this issue. Tre. Hees past hope. King. He has a victory ins death, this world Deserv'd him not, how soone he was translated To glorious eternitie, tis too late To fright the ayre with words, my teares embalme him. Wif. What can become of me? Qu. Ile be your husband Madam, and with care Supply your childrens father, to your father Ile be a sonne, in what our love or power Can serve his friends, Chabot shall nere be wanting, The greatest losse is mine, past scale or recompence, We will proceede no further gainst the Chancellor, To the charitie of our Admirall he owes His life which ever banish'd to a prison, Shall not beget in us, or in the subject New feares of his injustice, for his fortunes Great and acquir'd corruptly, tis our will They make just restitution for all wrongs That shall within a yeare be prov'd against him; O Chabot that shall boast as many monuments As there be hearts in France, which as they grow, Shall with more love enshrine thee, Kings they say, Die not, or starve succession, oh why Should that stand firme, and Kings themselves despaire, To finde their subject still in the next heire. Exeunt. FJNJS.</field>
