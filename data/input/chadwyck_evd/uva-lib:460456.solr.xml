      <field name="fulltext">BRUTUS; A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This Tragedy was first brought on the Stage in the year 1730. It met with less Success in France than any of our Author's Pieces, having been played only sixteen Nights. Yet none of his Tragedies have been translated into so many languages, or been so much admired by Foreigners. The present Edition differs greatly from the former.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. JUNIUS BRUTUS, Consul. VALERIUS PUBLICOLA, Consul. TITUS, Son of Brutus. TULLIA, Daughter of Tarquin. ALGINA, Confidant of Tullia. ARUNS, Ambassador from Porsenna. MESSALA, Friend of Titus. PROCULUS, a Military Tribune. ALBINUS, Confidant of Aruns. Senators. Lictors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, ROME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. BRUTUS, THE SENATE. Scene, a Part of the House appropriated to the Consuls on the Tarpeian Mount. At a Distance, the Temple of the Capitol. The Senators are assembled between the Temple and the House, before the Altar of Mars. The Consuls, Brutus and Valerius Publicola, preside. The Senators are ranged in a Semi-circle. The Lictors with their Fasces stand behind them. BRUTUS. Avengers of tyrannic power, who own No kings except the righteous Gods of Numa, Your virtue, and the laws; at length our foe Begins to know us. This imperious Tuscan, Whose voice was that of absolute command, Whose arm supports a tyrant like himself, Porsenna, Tarquin's dread ally, whose hosts O'erspread the banks of Tiber, on the Senate Reflects with awe, and fears the sons of freedom. This day before your eyes the crest of pride Lowly he stoops, and begs that he may treat By his ambassador; Aruns, by him Deputed, is arrived, and now requests An audience from the senators of Rome. He waits in yonder temple, you will judge Whether it more becomes you to refuse, Or order his admission. VALERIUS PUBLICOLA. Let him bring Whatever terms he may, and for our ears However meet, unheard we ought to send him Back to his lord. Ye have what I advise. No more to Rome of treaty with her foes Till they are vanquish'd. Twice indeed thy son Raising the scourge of vengeance, hath repulsed The tyrant of Hetruria; I confess The debt which his illustrious valour claims; And own he stands, by thy example taught, The saviour of his country. But not e'en These deeds suffice. Rome still begirt with arms, Views near her walls the race which she abhors. Let Tarquin yield to our decrees; the law Doom'd him to exile; let him quit the state, And purge our borders of imperial crimes, Then may we listen to his prayers. But much This title of ambassador it seems Works on your minds. Unable to subdue, The tyrant now is anxious to deceive us. Caution alarm'd beholds with jealous eye These regal messengers, insidious foes Deck'd with the badge of honour, who advance Replete with haughtinesse, or all the wiles Of dextrous craft, and with impunity Insult us, or betray. Listen not, Rome, To their seducing words; disdaining art, Thine is war's generous task; confound the foes Who sicken at thy glory; fall thyself, Or punish guilty kings; be these thy treaties. BRUTUS. Rome knows I prize her liberty beyond All that is dear. Yet tho' my bosom glows With the same ardour; my opinion differs. I cannot but behold this embassy As the first homage paid by sovereign power To Rome's free sons; we should accustom thus The towering and despotic pride of kings To treat on even terms with our republic; Till heaven accomplishing its just decrees, The time shall come to treat with them as subjects. Aruns is here no doubt, intent to mark Our yet unsettled state, what hidden springs Nourish its rising grandeur, to explore Its genius, and observe its strength. All this Proves it a duty, fathers, to admit him Into our presence, let the senate's foe Know who, and what we are; a monarch's slave At length prepare himself to look on men. Let him at leisure cast his eye o'er Rome, Here will he view her, and in you survey Her guardian bulwarks. Let him on this spot Revere the God whose altar stands before us; Let him approach the senate, hear, and tremble. [The Senators rise and come forward to give their votes. VALERIUS PUBLICOLA. Thine is the general suffrage; Rome and thou Must be obey'd; I with reluctance yield. Go, lictors, introduce him to our presence, And may the Roman dignity from thence Remain uninjured! [To Brutus. All our eyes are turned On thee alone; thy hand first brake our chains. This high debate of liberty to thee Glad we intrust; thou art her father, Brutus, And who more fit to plead her sacred cause? SCENE II. ARUNS, ALBINUS, ATTENDANTS. Aruns enters, preceded by two Lictors, with Albinus his Friend; he passes by the Consuls and Senate, salutes them, and takes a Seat prepared for him in the Front of the Stage. ARUNS. Consuls, and fathers, with what heartfelt joy Mix I with this assembly! Hallow'd band Of sage deliberating foes! How pleased View all those heroes, in whose thoughts or deeds E'en to this hour severest equity Can find one only flaw! Your noble acts To scan, to look with wonder on your virtues, And crowning all the glorious sum, to hear Rome's blended accents from the lips of Brutus. Far from the clamours of the barbarous herd, Wild and untutor'd, who by headstrong rage Are hurried on, united, and disjoin'd. Blind in their hate, in their affections blind, Who menace, tremble, rule and cringe by turns In one short day; whose boldnessâ BRUTUS. Cease; and learn That more respect is due when thou would'st name The citizens of Rome. To represent That virtuous people, thou hast dared insult, The senate justly glories. While with us, Banish thy art, dismiss thy flattery, The poison in Hetruria's court prepared, As yet untasted by the Roman senate. Proceed. ARUNS. Less moved by these sonorous words, Than pitying your devoted state exposed To sure destruction, like a son of Rome Now hear me plead its cause. You see the storm Instinct with vengeful fires and bursting round you. In vain will Titus strive to turn aside The furious bolt. With sorrow I perceive His valour and his zeal can but insure A more illustrious downfall to his country. His victories weaken your deserted ramparts, They seem as sapp'd and tottering with the blood Which floats around. No longer then refuse A peace so needful to your dearest interests. And though the assembled senate claim the name Of common father to the Roman people, Remember that the race, the royal race, Your wrath pursues, can call Porsenna theirs. But say, you dread avengers of your country, You whose enlightened souls expound the rights Of all mankind, who judge dependent kings; Mark you this place? Observe you where you are? There stands the capitol, the altar there On which, attesting all th'immortal gods I saw you once, (far different then indeed Was your religious warmth) swear to obey Tarquin your lawful monarch; say what gods Have since new framed the rights of kings? What power Hath broke those ties so hallow'd erst? What hand Hath torn the crown from Tarquin's sacred brows? Who hath absolved you from your oaths? BRUTUS. Himself. Urge not the ties his crimes have broke: the gods Whom he hath scorn'd, the rights by him destroy'd. When rendering homage, Aruns, to our prince We swore obedient faith, not servitude. But if thou here beheld'st at Tarquin's feet The senate kneel, and offer up their vows, Remember likewise in this very place, On that most holy altar, and before The same attesting deities, that he Swore to be just. Such was the bond between Him and his people, and he then returned Our oath, when first he falsified his own. When he dared prove a traitor to the laws, Rome was no longer subject to his power, Rebellion his alone. ARUNS. But grant it true that Tarquin drawn aside By absolute dominion had a while Stray'd from his duty, and too far pursued Its witching blandishments; where lives the man From error free? The king exempt from weakness? Inform me under what pretence you claim The right of chastisement? You who were born His subjects? framed by Nature to obey? The son ne'er lifts his hand against his sire Though criminal, but with averted face Sighs, and reveres him. Are the rights of kings Less, think you, to be prized? We are their children. Their judges are the gods. If in its wrath High Heaven sometimes creates them, would you merit Severer punishments? Destroy the laws You seek t'avenge? And in confusion plunge The government you only wish to change? Tarquin henceforth, school'd by adversity, Great tutoress of mankind, will prove more just, More worthy of imperial Rome. Oh! brace With happiest concord, firmest energy, The legal bonds of prince and people! You Possess the option, give it but effect, And public liberty shall bloom anew Beneath the sacred shade of regal power. BRUTUS. The time is past. All nations have their laws; From their peculiar nature first derived, Or modell'd by their choice. Their monarch's slaves, Slaves to their priests, the Tuscans seem as born To crouch beneath the yoke; self-satisfied Adore the fetters rivetted by time, And like themselves, would bend the world to bondage. All Greece is free; while soft Ionia still Sits languishingly weak, its mind inured To shameful slavery. Rome hath had her kings; Not absolute however; Romulus, Great founder of our state was but the first Among its citizens; they shared with him The weight of sovereignty. Tho' Numa framed Our laws, by them his actions too were bound. At length (I own th'unworthy deed with shame) Rome made an evil choice, and from the Tuscans, From you, her king selected; with him came From your Hetruria's bosom, from its court, Its vices, and tyrannic thirst of sway. [He rises. Forgive the Roman people, mighty gods, Their long forbearance to the guilt of Tarquin! The torrent streams of blood, he fiercely spilt, Have each barrier of duty swept away. The realm long crush'd beneath his iron rod Through dint of sufferings hath regain'd its virtue. Tarquin hath fix'd again our native rights; And from th'uncommon rankness of his crimes Each public blessing sprang. Your Tuscans now May follow, if they dare, the bright example, And shake off tyrants. [The Consuls descend towards the Altar, and the Senate rises. O Immortal Power! God of heroic chiefs, of warring hosts, And of illustrious Rome! O Mars! receive The vows we pour forth on thy sacred altar, In the consenting senate's mingled name, In mine, and that of all thy genuine sons, Who not disgrace their sire! If hid within Rome's secret bosom, there exist a traitor, Who with base mind regrets the loss of kings, And would again behold a tyrant lord; May the wretch die beneath a thousand tortures! His guilty ashes scattered through the air The sport of winds, while nought remains behind But his vile name, more loathsome to the tongue Of latest times than that which Rome condemns To utmost infamy, detested Tarquin's. ARUNS. [Approaching the Altar. And I, upon this altar, which your vows Have thus profaned, in Tarquin's royal name Whom you with scorn reject, and in the name Of great Porsenna his avenger, swear To you and to your sons eternal war. [The Senators move towards the Capitol. Hear me a moment, senators, nor yet Dismiss th'assembly; injuries there are Which still remain unnoticed. Tarquin's daughter, Your prisoner, say, is she a victim too, To Rome devoted? Are her royal hands Loaded with chains, the more t'insult her father, And every sovereign in the world, with him? Shall I proceed? The wealth, the stores, the treasures Whence fed, the streams of Tarquin's bounty flowed Through his loved city; claim you these by conquest? Or as a gift? Was it to share the plunder That you dethroned the monarch? Let the senate Its orders give, and Brutus shall refuse them. BRUTUS. Misjudging man! how ignorant of Rome, And her sublimer nature! See those worthies, Patrons of justice, fathers of their country, Grown old amid the dignities of state, And virtuous poverty! Superior far To treasures, which they willingly resign, It is their boast to triumph over kings Who prize the glittering trifles. Take it hence, The sordid mass; our fixed souls disdain it. As to the odious tyrant's hapless daughter, Spite of the hate, the well-deserved hate I bear to all her family, the senate Confided her to my protecting care. The flattering strains which fascinating, charm The heirs of royalty, and taint their hearts With subtle poison, have not reached her here. The shining pomp, and soft voluptuousness Of Tarquin's court, bane to the giddy mind Of thoughtless youth, she hath not here experienced. But well I know what generosity And honour prompt, what to her sex is due, Her tender age, and more, to her misfortunes. This day to Tarquin let her be restored, Conduct her to the camp; a secret joy Thence rises in my soul. Oh! May the tyrant Hereafter nought possess within our walls, But Rome's abhorence, and the wrath of heaven! The treasures to remove we grant a day, Let that suffice. Meantime beneath my roof Receive protection, and partake the rights Of hospitality. The assembled fathers Thus speak through me; this evening bear our answer Back to Porsenna, we present him, war. For Tarquin, let him know what thou hast seen Within the Roman senate. [To the Senators. Let us haste Now to the capitol, and ornament Its vaulted dome with laurels which engird My son's victorious brows; there let us hang The bloody ensigns, shields, and brazen spears Which with successful struggle his brave hands Have wrested from the Tuscans. Ever thus From age to age with the same spirit fired, Worthy their country, may my offspring prove Their zeal and steady faith! Ye gods protect Against our foes the father's consulship! Protect the son in the dread field of death! SCENE III. ARUNS, ALBINUS. [Having retired from the Hall of Audience, into an Apartment in the House of Brutus. ARUNS. Didst thou remark the firm unyielding spirit Of this proud senate which believes itself Invincible? It would be so Albinus, Were Rome allow'd the time to school her sons, And root this daring boldness in their hearts. Trust me; that liberty to which all bend With adoration, which though purposing To wrest from them, I cannot but admire, Gives to mankind a strenuous fortitude, A loftiness of thought, of which before They never traced a single lineament Existing in their breasts. Reduced beneath The Tarquin yoke, a pliant court, which nursed The principles of slavery, relax'd Their hardy manners, and enervated Their active vigour. Whilst their king intent To fetter his own subjects, undisturbed Suffered our happy Tuscans to enjoy The sweets of peace. But should the senate rouse Their inborn genius from its dread repose, Should Rome be free; Italia is undone. These lions, by their keeper rendered mild, Their pristine fierceness will again assume And headstrong rush upon us. Let us then Choak in their vital origin the seeds Profuse of misery to the Ausonian states, And havock to the world. Assuring thus The universal freedom; while on them We fix the chains, they destine for mankind. But will Messala come? May I expect him? And will he dare? ALBINUS. My lord, he will attend you; A moment brings him. Titus is his friend. ARUNS. Hast thou contrived to sound him? May I utter My thoughts with confidence? ALBINUS. Unless I err, Messala joins our plot; that he may change His own condition, rather than the empire. Intrepid, firm, as if each brave resolve From conscious honour flow'd, or patriot love. For ever secret, master of himself, Impenetrable to the keenest eye, And mid the whirlwind of his passions, calm. ARUNS. Such he appear'd to me, when once his guest During the reign of Tarquin; which confirm'd By all his letters since. But lo! he comes. SCENE IV. ARUNS, MESSALA, ALBINUS. ARUNS. Generous Messala, in whose breast survives A grateful friendship t'ward thy injured master, Say cannot Tarquin's gold, Porsenna's gifts, Relax the minds of these stern senators, And shake their faith? Are their rough-moulded hearts To all the tempting pleasures of a court, To hope and fear, impassive? Do they stand, These fierce patricians, in the rank of gods, Judges of all mankind, and dreading none? Have they no secret vices, warm desires, Or private interests? MESSALA. Such are their vain boasts But their dissembled justice, and severe Inflexible, austerity, which scorns Every allurement, only mark the thirst Of their imperious hearts, for sovereign power. Their pride superior, underneath their feet Treads the proud diadem; and when they brake The yoke of kings, they but imposed their own. These great avengers of our liberty, Arm'd to defend it, are its worst oppressors. Under the humble and seducing names Of patrons and of fathers, they affect The gait of monarchs; Rome hath changed her fetters. And while her nobles rule without controul, Is, for one king, cursed with an hundred tyrants. ARUNS. Is there not one among your citizens Whom wisdom teaches with indignant eye To view such abject slavery? MESSALA. Few perceive Their hidden bonds; but every sense still wild With this great change, intoxication reigns. The meanest wretch in his extreme degree Of low mechanic baseness, having join'd To hunt out monarchs, thinks himself a king. But as I wrote; some friends of mine there are Who with reluctance feel the galling load Of this new yoke. Disdaining the weak herd, And their fond foolish errors, they alone Mid the fierce-rushing torrent stand unmoved. Men of tried minds, whose hearts and hands are formed To take, or model empires at their will. ARUNS. What may I hope from these brave sons of Rome? Will they assist their prince? MESSALA. They are prepared For every deed most hazardous; prepared To spill their blood profusely in his cause. But yet imagine not, devoutly blind, That they will toil for an ungrateful master. They boast not that enthusiastic warmth To fall as victims to despotic power, And rush with senseless zeal on death itself T'avenge a tyrant, who will afterwards Not even know them. Tarquin's promises Are large and full, but having gain'd his point He may erase their actions from his mind, Or haply view them with the jealous look Of secret fear. Well do I know the great; Friends in their adverse, in their prosperous hour Neglecting all past benefits, nay oft The bitterest enemies. We are no more Than servile instruments to their ambition, Cast by with scorn when thought no longer useful, When dangerous destroy'd. My friends will move Only on stipulated terms, which fix, And they are sure as fate. They ask a chief Worthy their courage, with whose dazzling name To catch the light inconstant multitude. Whose power, should we succeed, may bind the king, And keep his faith inviolate; a chief Whose daring temper, should the secret woof Of our designs be traced, will still uphold And best avenge our cause. ARUNS. Your letters taught me That the proud heart of Titusâ MESSALA. He supports The Roman state; he is the son of Brutus; Yetâ ARUNS. In what light views he th'unjust reward With which the haughty senate hath repaid His gallant deeds? His arm alone preserved The city from destruction. Yet the worth Of his full soldiership, could not procure him The rank of counsel; they, I know, refused it. MESSALA. At which, I know, he murmurs. His high soul, Prompt to resent, swells with the injury. What meed hath he obtain'd, but empty shouts? A triumph's vain and tinsel pageantry? And a few gawdy beams of transient splendor? I've read his proud heart through; and know the strong And warm emotions of his kindled rage. Just enter'd on the spacious field of glory From the scarce seen, and yet unbeaten path He may be turn'd aside; for fiery youth Is prone to be misled. But to remove Each stubborn prejudice which warps his breast, There is the toil; the love he bears to Rome; His hate of kings; a consul, and a father; His dread of shame; and more, the wreaths new-won, By his heroic acts. Now understand Titus with me, now mark his inmost soul, The grief which stings, the poison rankling there. That soul is fix'd on Tullia. ARUNS. Fix'd on Tullia! MESSALA. With difficulty from his struggling breast I forced the secret. At himself he blush'd; Nor would his fierce unbending spirit deign To own love's mastery, dreading to be seen By its soft impulse moved. Amid the shock Of diverse passions which contend within And agitate his frame, still liberty Excites his warmest ardour, every thought Is frenzy-fired t'ward her. ARUNS. Thus then it seems Upon the movements of a single heart, Spite of myself, depends the fate of Rome. But let us on with confidence.âAlbinus Prepare this instant for the camp, to Tarquin. [To Messala. Let us unto the princess. I can boast Some small experience in the ways of men, Some knowledge of the heart. Now with keen eye To look thro' her's. Who knows what prosperous snares Her hands may form t'entrap these sons of Rome! END of the FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Palace of the Consuls. TITUS, MESSALA. MESSALA. No; friendship sensible to every touch, Here feels th'inflicted wound. He who conceals Half of his secrets, telling me too much, Or not enough, both injures, and suspects me. TITUS. No more: my heart relies upon thy faith, Unboundedly relies. Reproach me not. MESSALA. Hah! Thou, whose wrongs deep-piercing and severe Urged thee so late with me t'inveigh against The rigid Senate; trusting to my breast Rome's most important secret, the complaints Superior excellence pours forth, the tears Indignant heroes shed; say, how so long Couldst thou, within thy labouring bosom, hide A grief more tenderly affecting? Pangs, To whose nice touch the heart is all alive? And e'en from me lock up th'imprison'd flame? Say, could ambition, which imperious rules O'er every thought, extinguish in thy mind The soft, the dear sensations? Or the pain The Senate caused, was that more exquisite? And thy resentment stronger than the love Thou bear'st to Tullia? TITUS. Oh! I love with transport, And hate with fury; to their wild extremes My passions always hurry me, I own it. And conscious of the failings of my heart, I struggle to subdue them. MESSALA. But why thus Exasperate the wound, and give it force By anguish self-applied? Conceal thy love, And yet disclose thy injuries? TITUS. What mean These questions, my Messala? Tho' I look'd With indignation on this jealous Senate, For them with lavish waste I spilt my blood. Thou know'st it, and thy ardent bosom shared With me the victory. Pleasing was the theme, By my renown inspired; my heart elate, Glowing with bright success, and trophies won, Found a superior lustre in the thought Of fighting for th'ungrateful. Ills o'ercome We readily impart, but who can bear Oppress'd and vanquish'd, to recount his shame? MESSALA. What is thy shame? Whence springs this mighty cause For deep contrition, and repentant gloom? What feelings of thy soul demand a blush? TITUS. I blush at my own weakness; at this rash, This fond, this foolish passion, which rebels Against my duty. MESSALA. Are ambition then, And love with all its train of warm desires, Passions unworthy of a noble mind? TITUS. Ambition, love, resentment, all conspire To rack my soul; these senators, these kings, Scoff at my youth, and with disdain refuse The rank for which my valour sues in vain, And purchased by my blood. Then while my heart Is with this insult torn, that I may lose All I hold dear, they snatch my Tullia from me. From me! O fond delusion of the mind! What right hast thou, or what pretence to mark With jealous tongue the blessing as thy own? Ah! I perceive the fire so long conceal'd, Bursting from it's restraint, more fiercely burns, And will not be extinguish'd. Yes, Messala, I had sustain'd the conflict, she had left me, Methought my heart already had subdued This fatal passion, I beheld again My native freedom, and rejoiced to find That bondage was no more. Just Heaven! are these Thy limits fix'd? Must resolution stop E'en here, and pass no further? Hah! must I, The son of Brutus, the sworn foe of kings, Stoop ignominious to the Tarquin race? Th'ungrateful fair rejects too with disdain My offer'd love. On all sides scorn'd, my shame Glares equally conspicuous. Rage, revenge, Confusion, and desire, by turns possess My soul, and rouse tumultuous faction there. MESSALA. Say, may I interrupt thee, and disclose My thoughts with confidence? TITUS. To thy advice I always listen'd with attentive awe, For Prudence is thy guide; speak, let the sense Of all its follies strike my conscious heart, And all its devious frenzy. MESSALA. I approve Thy love and thy resentment. Is it meet That Titus should impart authority To the tyrannic senate, whose proud souls Would bend us to the earth? If thou must blush, Blush at thy patience only, not thy love. Is this the recompence of matchless valour And warm affection? Without rank or power A common citizen! A hopeless lover! Thus to behold thee drooping and forlorn! A victim of the state! By Tullia slighted! Insulted by the senate! Oh! Were thine Such sentiments, as haply I could give! How speedily might'st thou possess the one! And on the other satisfy revenge! TITUS. Lost as I am, why thus with flattering voice Awake vain hope? What efforts can I try To soothe her scorn of mind? Or overcome Its settled principles?âNo moreâno more. Observe what fatal barriers rise between us; Our fathers, and our duty. Then reflect That her disdain is equal to my love. And must she go? MESSALA. She must, this day. TITUS. Indeed! But I will not complain; for heaven is just To her exalted merit; she was form'd To grace a throne. MESSALA. The will of heaven perhaps Had for her head propitiously decreed A fairer crown, and had not this proud senate, Had not these wars, nay had not Titus' selfâ Forgive me; but thou know'st th'inheritance Which is her due. Her brother being dead, The throne of Rome became her legal right. What have I said?âYet if to serve my friend, If to ensure his happiness, my life Were needful; if my bloodâ TITUS. Noâmy resolves Are fix'd; to duty's all-commanding voice Lowly I bend. The man who hath determined To gain his freedom, is that moment free. I own this dangerous poison for a time Forced reason from her native seat. But still A warrior's heart can combat and o'ercome Each soft insidious charm. Love, tyrant love On our own weakness rears his boasted power. MESSALA. Lo! Where the Heuxrian envoy comes! to thee This honour paidâ TITUS. O fatal honour! say, Wherefore? And what with me? He bears from hence My much-loved Tullia; he makes sure my doom; Compleats the sad misfortunes of my life, And casts th'accumulated load upon me. SCENE II. TITUS, ARUNS. ARUNS. Having essay'd the senate, and in vain Strove to preserve this hapless state; permit me Off'ring to virtue and transcendent worth Due homage, unforbidden to admire That generous courage, that protecting arm Which shielded Rome, and stopt its headlong fall When to the steep abrupt of danger lead By its blind rulers. Of a nobler prize Ah! how deserving! Of a different foe! And cause more just! How would that dauntless valour Have shone in other fields? At its return How crown'd with more becoming wreaths! My tongue Shall tell, and tell thee boldly, that I mean The juster cause of kings, who would intrust Their empire to thy hands, nor dread the virtue Which they admire; which I have seen excite Rome's fervid transports, while the senate shook With anxious jealousy. It grieves my soul That thou should'st bend beneath these savage masters, Whom merit but provokes, on whom good deeds Are cast away; who, born to serve, esteem it Among their sordid honours to stretch forth The hand of power on their deliverer. If they had not usurp'd the regal sway, From thee they ought those orders to receive Which now they give. TITUS. For this attentive care, These generous thoughts t'ward me, accept my thanks; Their aim too may be guess'd. They need no comment. The lure of subtle policy to arm My discontent against the public state, Flattery's sweet bait to call my passion forth, And urge it on to rash pernicious deeds, Offspring of thoughtless rage. This waste of art Will ne'er intrap sincerity; it glares Too visibly apparent. All my soul Is undisguised, nor owns a sentiment It wishes to conceal. The partial senate Hath injured me, that injury demands My hatred, and that hatred I confess; Yet is my ready arm obedient still; When prompted by the common cause we seek The crimson field, Rome in her daring sons Extinguishes at once each latent spark Of private animosity; we move Victors of every passion, link'd in bonds Of firmest union, not a foe is ours, But tyrants, Aruns, and the friends of tyrants. See what I am, and what I will be. Sway'd Whether by pride of heart, or conscious virtue, Or haply, as thou deem'st, by prejudice, Yet born a Roman, I for Rome will die. This rigorous senate, tho' to me unjust, Full of suspicious jealousy and fear, I love beyond the splendour of a court, And the proud sceptre of a single lord. I am the son of Brutus, and my heart Deep-graven bears the love of liberty, And hate of kings. ARUNS. May not ideal forms, And visionary beauties cheat the eye? Not to thyself is liberty more dear Than to this breast. Tho' born beneath a king, I prize, and have experienced all her charms. You each substantial blessing sacrifice, To chace a phantom which you ne'er enjoy. To speak with plainness, where exists more strong The true despotic spirit, than in states Converted to republics? Every law Breathes tyranny; not merit can relax Their barbarous rigour; interest, family, Prefer their suit in vain. The senate rules, With iron rod, the populace affronts you. You must be fear'd, or creep an abject worm. A citizen of Rome suspicious, mean, Or insolent, is either fraught with hatred Against superior excellence, or walks Proudly erect, and boasts an equal height; Glory's bright beams excite his wildest rage, And sting him e'en to madness. With keen eye Severely piercing, he beholds in those Who serve him best, naught but the power to raise And give effect to mischief. Banishment The final doom, and grateful recompence, For all the blood they lavish'd in his cause. Doubtless a court is not without its rocks And hidden quicksands. But its sun more pure More genial shines, and tempests seldom rise Deforming its serener sky. E'en freedom Elsewhere so vaunted, cherish'd by the prince Oft gayly smiles, and wears a lovelier hue. A monarch's hand is liberal of rewards, Warm is his friendship, and his ready mind Anticipates the service; glory knows No self-denial, but enjoys unblamed Its exquisite sensations. By the prince Beloved, invested with his rays, you own But one superior; lord o'er all beside. While dazzled by the splendor which surrounds Those whom he favours, shouting crouds attend, And e'en our very faults become the theme Of popular applause. We never dread A senate's envious frown, its harsh decrees Intrude not on our ear. Oh! Born to grace A court, or shine illustrious in the field! How woul'st thou have enjoy'd the smiles of Tarquin's bounty! And own'd the charms of his unrivall'd goodness! Need I more plainly speak? He loved thee Titus, With thee he would have shared his sovereign power. Then would this haughty senate at thy feet In low prostrationâ TITUS. I have seen his court, And seen it with contempt. I might have cringed, Have humbly begg'd, and gain'd no doubt his favour, Been his first slave, and tyrannised beneath him. But, thanks to heaven, such weakness, manhood's stain, Resides not here. My soul aspires to greatness, But not by sordid steps. I feel within An energy which tells me I was ne'er Destined to base subjection. Be it mine, Opposed in glorious war, to meet these kings, Go thou and serve. ARUNS. I cannot but approve This bright excess of constancy. Yet think, Reflect a moment on thy tender age, On Tarquin's love, how interested then In all thy welfare. Often he recalls Those pleasing scenes, and when he mourn'd with me, But yesterday, his son's untimely death, His own misfortunes, Titus (he exclaim'd) Would have sustain'd my sinking family. He only would with justice have deserved My kingdom, and my daughter. TITUS. Hah! His Daughter! Ye Gods! My Tullia! Oh disastrous love! ARUNS. I bear her hence to Tarquin; to the king Thou hast rejected, soon to be removed Far from her country, far from thee, to bless Ligurian's monarch, and partake his throne. Meanwhile be this thy residence, here serve Thy favourite senate, persecute her father, And desolate her realm. But oh! May soon Avenging fires these arched roofs destroy! Level yon capitol in ashes! Sink These stately towers! May their commingled flames The senate's and the people's tombs illumine! Triumphal torches to our happy nuptials! SCENE III. TITUS, MESSALA. What stings, Messala, hath he left behind! What scorpion stings? Would Tarquin then to me Have given her! Oh! Heart-rending thought! To me! And might I!âNoâinsidious minister It was thy purpose with malignant search To pierce the foldings of my soul, and find The secret passion there! Alas! Unveil'd And obvious, what observer's transient glance Would it elude! E'en in my eyes he read The warm desires which prey upon my frame. Conscious of all my weakness, he returns, My idle hopes, and rash successless love The theme of his derision, and the jest Of Tarquin's court.âAnd might I then have gain'd This matchless blessing! All my future days To her devoted! All my being hers! Had heaven decreed that Tullia should be mine! Oh! Multiplied distress! MESSALA. Thou may'st be happy, Aruns thy virtuous passion will approve, Nay give his aid; believe me. TITUS. Banish far The vain delusion. Rome with loud acclaim Invites me to the capitol; the people Seek the triumphal arches rais'd on high, Thick with my glory crown'd, and full adorn'd With all my labours, underneath their shade Convened, they wait my presence to begin The sacred rites, the strict coercive oath, Inviolable surety of our freedom. MESSALA. Go, serve these lordly masters. TITUS. I will serve them; It is the sacred mandate of my duty, And that shall be obey'd. MESSALA. Whence then that sigh? TITUS. 'Tis a hard victory. MESSALA. And too dearly purchased. TITUS. Therefore more glorious.âOh! Forsake me not In this extremity! [Exit Titus. MESSALA. With speed pursue! Cleave to his steps! Imbitter every pang! And tear the wound which festers in his heart SCENE IV. BRUTUS, MESSALA. BRUTUS. Messala, stay I shall not long detain thee. A few brief words. MESSALA. With me? BRUTUS. With thee Messala! A secret-working venom o'er my house Hath spread its baleful influence. Tiberinus Incensed against his brother, hath withdrawn The veil, and all his jealous rage bursts forth. While Titus' frenzy takes a different course, Against the senate his audacious heart Swells with resentment. Thus disposed, their weakness Could not escape this Tuscan minister; No doubt he hath observed it, and with pleasure; Hoping by dextrous management to gain Some profit to his cause. Thus circumstanced, He hath address'd them both, and I suspect A statesman's soft insinuating tongue, Old in dissimulation, and each art Of a corrupted court. Tho' limited To-morrow to return, yet oft a day Is more than should be granted to a traitor. Think not, Messala, that I therefore fear Aught he can do; but e'er th'approach of night, Go thou, and tell him to depart from hence. It is my will. MESSALA. Prudence no doubt requires This step, and readily I bear your orders. BRUTUS. A moment longer.âIn the strictest ties Friendship hath knit my son with thee. I know The strong prevailing power of amity Over his heart. Without deceit himself, He never harbour'd a mistrustful thought. His unsuspicious youth is yielded up To thy experience; and the more his soul Confides in thee, the more I may expect Form'd as thou art, with aptest talents blest, Safe to direct his steps, not lead aside; Thou never wilt his greener years betray, Or take a mean advantage of his errors, To nurse ambitious hopes, and taint his mind. MESSALA. That was e'en now the subject of our converse. Thee he would wish to imitate, to serve And gain the esteem of Rome; he blindly loves His father, and his country. BRUTUS. So he ought. But above all, the laws. Their willing slave; Rejoiced to bear each burthen they impose. He who would aim to violate the laws, Can never love his country. MESSALA. What his arm Hath done to serve that country we have seen And both can witness it. BRUTUS. He did his duty. MESSALA. Rome had done hers, if haply she had graced The citizen who claims her warmest thanks With higher honours. BRUTUS. No; the consulate, The state's first office, is a dignity Above his age, and I refused my voice E'en to my son. Believe me the success Of his ambition, would have paved a way For vile corruption; virtue's just rewards Would have been deem'd hereditary titles; And oft we should have seen the worthless son Of a renowned father, sure to fill A station which his merit ne'er could gain, Sit careless down in luxury and sloth Waiting his future greatness. Can we find A more conspicuous, a more striking proof, Than our last Tarquin gave? How rarely those Deserve th'imperial robe, who first behold The light inwrapp'd in purple! Oh! From Rome This fatal partiality remove, Kind heaven! The cradle of voluptuous softness, The grave of virtue!âIf thou lovest my son (As I with joy persuade myself) display Before his eyes in all its genuine charms His real glory; stifle in his soul Th'extravagance of pride; to serve the state, That is his best reward. A son of mine Is in a more peculiar manner bound To set a bright example to the world Of every mental excellence. The shield, The guardian of his country, such the light In which I view him, and the more his deeds Deserve that character, the higher still I rise in my demands. My thoughts thus known, And what I wish he should be, judge, Messala, Of the true love I bear him. Temper thou Th'impetuous ardour of his youthful mind. Who flatters him, supplies his mortal bane, And injures Rome. MESSALA. The conduct I observe Is limited, to follow in the field Where Titus leads, to imitate his valour, But not instruct him; little is my power Over his mind! tho' would he lend an ear To my advice, Rome soon should be convinced That all his thoughts are fix'd upon her glory. BRUTUS. Go then, but scatter not upon his errors The incense of applause; for know tho' great My hate t'ward tyrants, I hate flatterers more. SCENE V. MESSALA. [Alone. A more detestable, relentless tyrant No where exists, than the severity Of thy harsh-moulded soul. But e'er long I may behold groveling beneath my feet The over-bearing pride of thy false virtue. Yes, thou Colossus, raised to such an height By the vile people; that huge bulk perchance These hands may crush; the thunder is prepared. END of the SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. ARUNS, ALBINUS, MESSALA. ARUNS. [A Letter in his Hand. Now in my bosom hope begins to build On surer grounds; thy speedy care demands My utmost thanks; prosperity attends; And every lucky circumstance accords With my warm wishes. Yes, inclosed, Albinus, Within this letter is the fate of Rome, The fate of Tarquin.âDidst thou in the camp The purposed scheme concert? And regulate The fatal hour? Hath the Quirinal gate Been duly reconnoitred? Or, should chance Hinder the malecontents from yielding up Their guarded post, is our assault prepared? And valour ripe for action? Doth the king Approve our services? Did he express His satisfaction?âWhat is thy opinion? Shall he re-enter Rome, bedew'd with blood, Or prostrate, and submissive to his will? ALBINUS. All will be ready at the midnight hour. Tarquin well-pleased, anticipates th'event Of your designs; and fancy, to his eye Holds forth the golden fruit. To you alone Professing that he owes his crown; to you A sum of gratitude beyond the claim E'en of Porsenna. ARUNS. Either heaven itself, Must interfere, those gods, whose hate pursues Ill-destined Tarquin, to confound a plan So great, so worthy their sublimer natures, Or by to-morrow's sun, shall Rome again Acknowledge him her lord. Rome sunk perhaps In ashes, or deep deluged with her blood. Better however thus, his throne regain'd, To stretch the sceptre o'er obedient subjects, Humbled by their afflictions; than to strive With pains incessant, on a haughty race To fix the curb, pamper'd by luxury, Stubborn, and with rank, vicious humours fraught By too much happiness.âThe princess, here, In secret I attend; go thou, Albinus. Messala stay. SCENE II. ARUNS, MESSALA ARUNS. And what, my friend, from thee? What hath thy zeal effected? Hast thou moved The rigid soul of Titus? Will he bend High-soaring as he is? May we conclude On his assistance? Will he, dost thou think, Join in the royal cause? MESSALA. There I presumed Beyond my strength. Inflexible he stands. Too much of that fond foolish patriot love Sticks to his breast; too much of Brutus' blood Runs bounding through his veins. Indeed he murmurs Against the senate, and for Tullia feels Love's warmest ardour. Conscious pride of heart, Ambition, the strong frenzy of desire, And Jealousy aroused, youth's vivid flame, And its wild hurrying passions, form'd methought An easy track for soft seductive art To glide into his soul. Yet, (past belief!) The tyrant liberty usurped o'er all Exclusive sway. Tho' his affection mounts To an enthusiast height; that, Rome controuls. Cautious and by degrees I tried t'erase That hate of Kings which false republic notions Have on his mind impress'd; a fruitless trial; Unchanged the savage prejudice remains. The very name of Tarquin stirr'd him up To sudden rage. He would not hear me speak: Brake off abrupt our converse, and retired. Had I our final aim disclosed to him, All had been lost. ARUNS. Too well I see, Messala, That we can never hope by any lure To win him to our purpose. MESSALA. Not thus arm'd I found his brother, not the toil so great To fix him all your own. Yes, mighty consul? One of thy sons at least by me is vanquish'd. ARUNS. Hah! Tiberinus! And engaged so soon! What secret wheels were thine? What prosperous arts Of mystic policy? MESSALA. His own ambition. That work'd my whole machine, its ruling spring. Long hath he mark'd with jealousy's keen eye Those honours which so visibly distinguish His brother from himself. These waving spoils On each fame-destined arch, these laurel wreaths, This proud triumphal splendour, all the sons Of Rome, nay Brutus self, before th'approach Of Titus, ushering on the festive pomp, Their hearts with exultation wing'd; hence flow His torments, there are also many wrongs, Which in his rankling mind inflame the sore Of latent envy, till it swells and bursts Imposthumate with venom. Meanwhile Titus, To malice and revenge a total stranger, Too far above his brother, e'er to cherish A thought of jealousy, oft t'ward him stoop'd, From the victorious car, his out-stretch'd arms; As if he meant, by that expressive act, In his warm breast t'infold him, and bestow A large participation of his glory. I seized the lucky moment; to his view A sphere more truly glorious pointed out, Bright-beaming in a court; I urged him home; And promised, in the name of Tarquin promised, The most exalted honours Rome could give Short of the throne; I saw his senses dazzled; I saw his resolution shake before me; His soul is thine: in proof of which, he seeks A speedy conference. ARUNS. Will he surrender To our possession the Quirinal gate? MESSALA. Titus alone that post commands; it seems As if decreed that his preventive virtue Should ever check your fortune in its course. To him the existence of the state belongs, Its tutelary god.âOn this assault, However sudden, let us not determine; The risk is infinite. Could he be won, Success were manifest; without his aid, It is a desperate trial. ARUNS. Would he stoop. A candidate solicitous, to gain The consular authority? And scorn Imperial grandeur's highest seat? The throne Affianced firm with Tullia? MESSALA. Regal honours So offer'd, his stern virtue would refuse, Nay deem an insult of the deepest die. ARUNS. Yet he loves Tullia. MESSALA. E'en to adoration. The more he strives against his flame, the more Its ardour blazes; his desires are fix'd With passionate excess upon the daughter, While he detests the father; at her name Fearful he starts, yet, silent, is a prey To bitterest grief; he seeks, he flies her presence; Swallows his hidden tears; and struggling still, Feels nought of love, but its infuriate transports. In the wild rage of such conflicting storms, A moment, may the firmest mind subdue. Titus full well I know; of fiery mould; Impetuous; should he yield, my sanguine wishes Would halt behind him; while the proud ambition, Now smother'd in his breast, would burn anew, Rekindled at the glowing torch of love, He could not but with utmost joy behold These humbled senators, with trembling hearts, And abject looks, low crouching at his feet. But not to feed you with delusive hopes, This passion, tho' so fatal to his peace, He may resist, superior to temptation. Yet once again at least, I will assail him, And this, the hour of trial. ARUNS. Since his heart Is not to love impassive; I despair not To list him with my friends. A single glance From Tullia's eyes, one magic word of hers, Will soften more his ruggedness of virtue, Than all the subtle windings, all the arts So potent to seduce, of him who form'd This daring plot, or which the teeming brain Of an ambassador could e'er supply. We must attack the part less surely arm'd, And from their weakness alone expect The service of mankind.âIn his ambition, And her prevailing tenderness, I see Conspirators, on whose effectual aid The king may safely lean. To them I trust The whole of our success; conscious, how poor My utmost efforts, when compared with them. [Exit Messala, SCENE III. TULLIA, ARUNS, ALGINA. ARUNS. [Presenting Tullia a Letter. This letter, from the king; to me inclosed. TULLIA. Protect him, heaven! And on his future days Shed beams more bright! [Reads. âThe throne of Rome again âMay from its ashes rise; and he who triumph'd âOver his sovereign, prove his surest friend. âIn Titus all the hero shines confest; âHe must uphold the sceptre, which I mean âTo share with him. Remember thou, from whom âThy being sprang; think on my weal or woe âTo thee alone confided. I insist not âOn the Ligurian monarch's claim; is Titus âThy better choice? The nuptials I approve.â Eyes! Is your vision perfect?âTitus!âNo; It cannot be.âMy father, through the progress Of his misfortunes still inflexible, Could he?âWhence learnt he this?âAnd how?âAlas! Why thus attempt to pierce into my heart? And wrest its secrets from me? Spare! Oh! spare A mind oppress'd with sorrow! Nor display The fraudful net for unsuspecting youth! ARUNS. My only aim is reverence to my king, Attention to his words, respectful silence, And zeal to do you service. Far from me Be it removed, those sentiments to trace Kept undisclosed by you! My eyes shall ne'er Presumptuous glance upon the sacred veil Around them cast.âYet duty bids me say, That heaven by you this empire will restore, And place its golden sceptre in your hand, The just reward of virtue. TULLIA. Hah! To serve My father! And engage without reproach My love to Titus!âBut will heâ ARUNS. Reject All doubts of him; the royal race is now That heroe's warmest care. Indignant scorn, The thoughts sublime which swell his generous heart, No longer can endure the gloomy malice Of these austere republicans. Denied, By the base senate what his valour claim'd, He feels, nor strives to soothe, th'imbitter'd pang. Now, pity t'ward his prince, and loyalty Resume their seat; Oh! Fix them in his soul! Not that I boast with accurate survey His bosom to have read; but knowing thee, He cannot but adore transcendent worth, And dignity of charms. What eye undazzled Can view a crown, by Tullia's hand presented? Herself, (a more inestimable gift,) To all the sparkling radiance of its gems Communicating lustre? Meet him then, Meet him alone, with power resistless arm'd. Triumph at once o'er this sworn foe of kings, Tear from the senate, to thy father give, This bulwark of the state, this guardian god. Oh! Struggle to deserve, the greatest honour, That ever was to human hands intrusted, The cause of Tarquin, and the fate of Rome. SCENE IV. TULLIA, ALGINA. TULLIA. All-gracious powers! What gratitude is due For this your bounty! By my tears disarm'd, Your's is this total change; the passion, erst Staining my cheek, your justice hath pronounc'd Spotless and pure; the fetters of restraint Are by your kindness loosedâHaste, fly, to seek him! Gods! Still he shuns my presence: shall I therefore When now he may be happy, suffer him To dwell in ignorance?âYetâdoth not hope Wave her delusive wand, and raise before me Vain, flattering images? And is it true, That Titus with such vengeful rage is fired Against the senate?âOh, tormenting thought! Must I from spleen and hatred then derive All that should flow from tenderness and love? ALGINA. I know the senate hath inflamed his anger, Know him ambitious; but his soul is thine, Thine every ardent wish. TULLIA. And that alone Will be the ruling motive of his actions. I doubt it not; each feebler principle Must yield to love. Hence then, with speed! Away! [Exit Algina. Yet, this extreme, this unexpected change.â My father's letterâin my mind arise A thousand anxious and perplexing thoughts. Dart forth thy rays, conspicuous shine, O love! And emulate my virtue! Glory calls, Reason impels, and filial piety Precedes my steps.âHah! and shall I replace The crown on Tarquin's honour'd brow! Shall I 'Twixt him and Titus knit the strong-link'd chain Of cordial amity! Shall I behold The public happiness upspring from mine! Together blooming!âThou, who could'st alone Subdue my heart, Oh, wherefore this delay! When to thy list'ning ear shall I disclose This wonderous turn of fate, beyond the stretch Of daring fancy's most excursive wing? When the now-hallow'd transports of my soul Shall I indulge? Attend to thee my Titus, Without regret? Without a pang reply? Dispers'd is every cloud of woe. Thee, Rome! Thee I forgive. Titus abandons thee, Rebellious Rome! And thy stiff neck must bend. Titus is mine; proud senate, thou must fall. His soul is mine; tremble with conscious dread! And recognize thy king! SCENE V. TITUS, TULLIA. TITUS. Am I deceived? Or wilt thou deign once more To cast thy eyes on this detested Roman, Whose presence shocks thy heart? So justly hated? So criminal t'ward thee? The bitterest foe Of Tarquin's race? TULLIA. Each envious star declines, And all is changed. Yes, fate will now permitâ Oh, Titus!âSpeak! Assure me, that I hold A true undoubted empire o'er thy soul. TITUS. Ah! Canst thou question whether that exists, Which long hath made me wretched? Bear I not In character most legible, the marks Of fervent love, of guilt, and of despair? Too surely have I proved thy absolute And fatal empire; my subjected heart To thy disposal willingly resigns A life not worth the name.âCommand! Exhaust Thy justly-hoarded vengeance. In thy hands Is placed my destiny. TULLIA. Mine springs from thee. TITUS. From Titus! Hah! Still trembling with its fears This bosom can with difficulty trust Even the voice of Tullia. Shall I then No more be hated by thee? Oh! proceed! Unfold the mystery!âWhat enchanting hopes, Thus in a moment, rap me on their wings, To the sublimest pitch of human bliss! TULLIA. [Giving him the Letter. Read; and let happiness be thine. Confirm it To me, and to my father. [While he is reading. Thus shall all My tender wishes.âHah! That angry frown! And now a cloud of sorrow dims his visage! Now consternation reigns! Immortal powers! TITUS. Surely I stand alone, the most accurst Of human beings. Treacherously kind, Intent t'o'erwhelm me with her blackest horrors, Fate gave a sight of happiness and snatch'd At once the transient vision. That my heart Might groan beneath the burthen of affliction Fully accumulated; she inspired The conscious thought that Tullia might be mine; Doom'd me to love, and see her ravish'd from me, TULLIA. Doom'd thee! Can Titus?â TITUS. I perceive my life From this sad moment is condemn'd to bear, The direst pangs of torture, or the load Of basest ignominy; to betray Thee, or my country; I can tread henceforth No path of safety; no alternative Remains, but that of misery, or of guilt. TULLIA. Hah! Could such words escape the lips of Titus! When from this hand I offer thee a crown! When I myself with-hold not! When thy eyes Have read the soft emotions of my heart, Open and undisguised! A father's power Giving a sanction to each tender thought, Converting love to duty!âI believed This day would shine pre-eminently graced, The brightest of my life. Alas, vain hope! For the first moment, when my soul o'erjoy'd, Might all its hidden sentiments disclose Without a blush, that moment is become, By thy ingratitude, the lasting source Of deep repentance.âDarest thou hint at misery? Thou talk of guilt? To serve a rebel crew Against their lawful king, plunge me in woe, Profess to love, hate and abjure my kindness, These are my miseries, and these form thy guilt. Oh! Titus, with enlighten'd sight behold What lies before thee, in impartial balance: There the refusal of the injurious senate Here, plenitude of power. Now make thy choice. Stoop to tyrannic laws, or be thyself The law-giver; ascend the regal throne, Or herd with the base multitude; determine To fix on Rome, or me.âInspire him, gods! With your own breath! And teach him how to act! TITUS. My choice is made. [Giving her back the Letter. TULLIA. And wilt thou not reveal it? Doth fear, doth shame restrain thee? Speak! Deserve Thy pardon, or my anger. Say, at once, Thy purpose. TITUS. That my actions shall evince me Worthy of thee; still equal to myself; And still unshaken in my zeal for Rome. To love with ardour, to resist with firmness; Adore thy virtues at an aweful distance, Yet strive to imitate them; lose thee, Tullia, Yet feel a conscious pride that I deserve thee. TULLIA. Thus then foreverâ TITUS. Oh! Forgive me, Tullia! Heed not the rash offences of my tongue; Scorn not my weakness; view with generous pity A heart its own worst foe, a thousand times More miserable now, than when condemn'd To thy severest hate. Oh! Frown not thus! Can I those charms resign! Impossible; Nor dare I forward look, and cherish hope. My life cannot be thine, without thee, death Must be my portion; yet would I confront it In its most ghastly shape e'er see thy faith Given to another. TULLIA. Oh! This heart, my Titus, Most frankly pardons all; its faith is thine, Still sacred and entire. TITUS. Transporting sounds! Rewarded thus! Thus blest with thy affection! Love me then, Tullia, with a Roman soul! Love the republic! Nobly soar beyond A queen's mean sphere! In lieu of regal state, The gawdy gems, and tinsel of a crown, Bring for thy nuptial gift, a breast which glows With patriot love! Thy country's laws revere! Be Rome henceforth thy mother! In thy chaste Encircling arms embrace the man, who fights Her battles, and supports her glorious cause! Let Brutus be thy father! And the sons Of Rome, by thy superior excellence, Thy generosity of mind o'ercome, Confess the daughter of a king hath laid Th'eternal base of freedom! TULLIA. Shall I then Betray;â TITUS. No; never. By despair impell'd, Where wander'd my vague thoughts? In every form Treason is base and horrible. I know The duty which a father claims; his rights Are absolute.âI knowâthy image fills My breastâto each idea lost beside, Lost to myself. TULLIA. Let Tullia then direct thee! Attend! Nor let her father speak in vain! TITUS. And have not I a father to obey? Shall I not hear, his, and my country's voice! TULLIA. Thy country! Barbarous Titus! Canst thou call By that dear name, the soil whence I am banish'd! TITUS. Alas! We must henceforth be enemies. Nature to thee, to me the laws command it? A savage duty to which both must yield. TULLIA. Henceforth be enemies! How could thy tongue Pronounce those dreadful words! TITUS. Oh! Witness heaven! My soul, and all its feelings give the lie To what I utter'd. TULLIA. Let those feelings prompt Thy future actions! Nobly in my cause Dare shew thy zeal! and whom thou lovest, avenge! SCENE VI. BRUTUS, ARUNS, TITUS, TULLIA, MESSALA, ALBINUS, PROCULUS, LICTORS. BRUTUS. [To Tullia. Princess! The time is come, and we must part. When first the public tempest wildly raved And shook the state, Rome, to thy household gods, Could not restore thee; in that hour of tumult On other cares intent, and every thought Employ'd on our destruction; Tarquin's self Mid war and vengeance, found within his breast No place for love of offspring, and forgot, Plunged in confusion, to demand his daughter. That I recall these images of woe Misconstrue not. Divided from thy father By me, thou hast a claim to my protection, My guardian friendship was, and still is thine. Go, Tullia, and may justice ever stand Near thy heaven-destin'd throne, and ceaseless watch With steady unaverted eye! That meek And willing homage may attend thee, yield A prompt obedience to the laws. Contemplate With sacred dread the task of royalty, Its numerous toils, and complicated duties. And if the flatterer's base pernicious art Should warp thy native equity of mind, When ready to abuse the sovereign power, And lift th'oppressive sceptre, e'er it fall, That instant, think on Rome, Remember Tarquin! Oh! May his fate a striking lessen prove; (And so I trust it shall) to future kings! A source of general blessing to the world! Aruns, to thee the senate hath resign'd Its trust; from thee a father and a husband With joy expect her.âProculus awaits. He will conduct you to the sacred gate. TITUS. [Aside. O agonizing love? O brain! the seat Of madness and despair!â [Advancing to Aruns. And shall I thus Permit?âI will notâlet me tell thee, Arunsâ [Exeunt Brutus and Tullia with their Attendants. Aruns and Messala remain. Gods! Can I live thus tortur'd with the pangs Of shame and grief? [To Aruns. Hear me! a moment hear me! ARUNS. The time forbids; my presence is required By Brutus and the princess; her departure I can retard for one short hour alone. Fear, to delay; fear, lest thou should'st resolve To speak too late. We may converse together In her apartment, fix her future fate, Perchance determine thine. SCENE VII. TITUS, MESSALA. TITUS. Capricious fortune! Didst thou conjoin our hearts, with savage force To disunite them thus! Hast thou decreed To place the brand of enmity between us! Oh, friend! This generous sympathy restrain! Heave not (if possible) the indignant sigh! Nor waste a tear on me! MESSALA. Such matchless virtue, Love so refined, and beauty in distress, Who can behold unmoved? A soul like hers Thou only can'st deserve. TITUS. The time is past. That soul must ne'er be mine. MESSALA. What power withstands! Rather what idle scruples form a bar To thy desires? TITUS. The cruel maid herself. Conditions odious, unsurmountable, Have been by her imposed. Despotic kings, Who oft have shrunk before my lightening spear, Can I then stoop to own myself your slave? Romans! Who underneath this sheltering arm Repose in safety, can I ever dare So meanly to betray you! Shall a passion Whose fierce assaults I have so long repell'd, Now with so dire a mast'ry triumph o'er me! Shall I expose my father to the rage Of these unpitying tyrants! Heavenly powers! And such a father? Nature's chosen hero! The paragon of men! His country's first, And great support! By whose instructive care, I fill the secondary rank of glory! By whose example perfected, I thought A time would haply come, when I might gain The same conspicuous eminence with him! Thus with the virtues leagued, inspired by them, And every action their's.âOh, dreadful fate! Heart-racking grief! Event most horrible! MESSALA. These were the virtues of inferior life, And well adorn'd a citizen of Rome. With what superior grace would'st thou display Those of a higher station! And behold, Where royalty obsequious, waits thy nod! Surely on this auspicious day, heaven looks Benignant down, and gives thee to possess Dominion, vengeance, and thy Tullia's love. Are these weak motives? Know this mighty consul, This chosen hero, with the titles deck'd Of public father, Atlas of the state, Founder of Rome, who sitting idol-like, Upon the ruins of the very throne Thy hands have crush'd, deceives thy dazzled eye; By prostrate crouds adored, and even drunk With their thick-steaming incense; had he proved In this adventurous struggle unsuccessful, Had not thy victories spread a lustre round him, Would only have been mark'd and stigmatiz'd As a seditious traitor.âThus renown'd; Covet augmented fame! Amid thy laurels Twine the more glorious olive! Oh! Recall Those milder days of harmony and peace, When liberty, in friendship knit with power, Content with sovereign sway, our ancestors Pois'd in due balance, and esteem'd as one The people's interests, and the monarch's greatness! Rome's hate of kings is not eternal, soon, Were thine the sceptre, she again would view them With eyes of filial love; for monarchy, Once by her wavering people highly priz'd, Tho' now abhorr'd; as different states incline, The object of their terror, or desire, Reason must own to be the best or worst Of human governments; a tyrant prince Will make it dreadful; and a good, divine. TITUS. This to my ear! Can I henceforth survey thee In any other light, but as begrimed, And foul with horrid treason? And myself The stain participating, who have suffer'd Thy converse uncontroul'd MESSALA. That as it may. But know, a man there is, prepared to snatch Th'inestimable meed, which thy faint soul Thus hesitates to enjoy. The work untried, He shall accomplish. TITUS. Hah! What man existsâ Cease thy dark hints.âGods! Who will dare?â MESSALA. Thy brother. TITUS. My brother! MESSALA. He. To Tarquin he hath sworn Inviolable faith. TITUS. Will Tiberinus. Betray his country? MESSALA. No: he means to serve Rome, and his sovereign. Who of thee regardless, Will give his daughter to th'intrepid youth Who shall with warmest zeal defend her father. TITUS. Just heaven! O fraught with perfidy!âWhat words Can adequately paint thy crime? My soul Long facinated, saw not underneath, the dark And dread abyss, o'er which by thee led on I stood unconscious. To the fatal choice Thou think'st me now reduced, t'accuse my brother, Or join in guilty partnership with him. But sooner shall thy bloodâ MESSALA. My punishment Is in thy hands; strike this unguarded breast: Its cares, its ardent wishes for thy service Demand the blow; slain'd with thy friend's warm blood, Go, stab thy brother, murder her thou lovest; Plunge the yet-reeking dagger in their hearts; Their corses drag before the senate; boast The glorious deed, and for the great reward Of all thy virtues, ask the consulate. Do this; or with anticipating step I haste before thee, to their listening ears Proclaim th'accomplices, and strait begin The sacrifice of horror. TITUS. Stay, I charge thee, Or dread ill-destined as thou art, the rage The madness of despair. SCENE VIII. TITUS, MESSALA, ALBINUS. ALBINUS. By Aruns sent; The time for his departure fix'd, permits him Once more to see thee; He is now with Tullia. TITUS. With Tullia! Oh! I hasten to her presence, Swift as the wing of thought.âYe gods of Rome! Ye ever-watchful powers, who guard my country! Here aim your vengeance! Pierce a heart which shrinks, Which feels the terrors of self-gender'd shame, Which had it never loved, would still have beat Responsive to the sacred touch of virtue. For you, must the devoted victim fall Ungrateful senate? Must it bleed for you, Pure, ardent, faithful love?âI come, my Tullia! [To Messala. See where the capitol in every part With trophied arches shine, the monuments Of my integrity. MESSALA. There likewise meet This hateful senate. TITUS. Thou fore-run'st my thoughts. There doth it meet indeed!âButâo'er my head Heaven's vollying thunders roll.âI hear a voice Awefully warning.âHold! Advance no further! Ungrateful Titus, thou betray'st thy country. No, Rome! No, Brutus! That shall never be. Ye gods, who stopp'd me on the verge of madness, I am again myself. Fame's brightest rays Have my past life illumed; nor have I tainted The clear and spotless fountain of my blood. Your victim is unblemish'd; and if doom'd To crimes involuntary, or to sink Beneath the load of fate, ye gods, avert All ill from Rome! Let Titus only perish! But strike in mercy, e'er he taste of guilt. END of the THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. TITUS, ARUNS, MESSALA. TITUS. Yes, I am fix'd as fate; go, seek the camp. Superfluous is this waste of time. O'erwhelm'd With shame, and with despair, henceforth no more I listen to thy words. Go; leave behind My virtue only; that, and my misfortunes Thou wilt not ravish from me. Strongly arm'd, Thy reasons strive in vain; not so her tears; Weak and defenceless, I confess their power, And will no more behold her. Constancy Shrinks at the sight; a glance of Tullia's eye Strikes greater dread, than all the tyrant kings, Could ever raise, with thieir embattled hosts. View her no more! and have I thus resolved! I haveâconduct her henceâimmortal gods! ARUNS. Not on my own account, but thine alone, Staid I in Rome; the portion'd hour we gain'd With difficulty, is full soon elaps'd; But Titus should remember it was moved for At his request. TITUS. Say'st thou!âAt my request! ARUNS. Alas! For thee and Tullia I had form'd With secret joy, a happier destiny. And idly hoped these fingers might have twined A rosy band uniting hearts so pure. How are these hopes destroy'd! TITUS. Insulting man! Thou hast survey'd me in the hour of shame, Degraded, lowly sunk beneath myself. Thou hast seen Titus, for a moment doubtful. Hence to thy masters, subtle as thou art, Witness of this disgraceful tenderness! Hence! Tell them all my failings. Let the tyrants Whom I have humbled, with exulting hearts, Know, that the son of Brutus wept before thee. But add at least, amid the bitter strife Spite of thy efforts, Tullia's matchless charms, And pleading tears, still victor o'er my passions, Enfranchised, and with soul forever Roman, At liberty I move, and unenslaved By Tarquin's race. That neither force, nor guile Shall shake my principles; that I have sworn, And now renew the oath, eternal war Against the blood of her my heart adores. ARUNS. The grief, which all thy senses hath usurp'd, Forbids resentment, and to me affords. A prevalent excuse. I leave thee, Titus, Pitying thy state calamitous, and e'en Thy prejudices viewing with respect. So far from wishing to oppress thy heart With added woes, I mingle tears with thine. But Tullia dies.âI can no more.âFarewel! MESSALA. O Heaven! SCENE II. TITUS, MESSALA. TITUS. No, never shall she place a foot Beyond the Roman confines; none shall dare Conduct her; at the peril of my life I will detain her here. MESSALA. Thou wilt not surelyâ TITUS. Far be it from me to betray my country! Yet, what owe I to Rome? Rome drives her henceâ Rome forces her away. But still our souls, Mix'd, interwoven, cannot be disjoin'd. I live, I breathe, for her will I pour forth My heart's warm stream to the last vital drop. Yet give me thy compassion, shew it now; My sufferings claim it all. Haste! fly! excite With the strong vehemence of friendly zeal, Those who with kindred bosoms feel our wrongs! Our chosen bands assemble! In despite Of the curs'd senate, she shall not depart. We keep her as an hostage, as a pledge Of treaty with the kings. This pretext urge. My will is absolute. MESSALA. To what a maze Of sad perplexity thy passion leads! And where will end this dangerous enterprize But in th'avowal of a luckless flame Destined thy bosom to consume in vain? TITUS. Hah! Well hast thou admonish'd. It is meet That to the senate I address my prayers. Go then with bland and gently-soothing voice Soften th'asperity of these new rulers, These kings of Rome. Alledge the public goodâ Nay that of Brutus.âHeaven! Where stray my thoughts, Hurried along, lost in the vacant gulph Of unessential deeds, and vain designs! MESSALA. In this just grief which tears the suffering heart; Bound to thy aidâ TITUS. I too am bound to see, Am bound to speak to her; this fatal way She needs must pass. Here will I take at least My final leave; here shall my tongue pronounce Th'eternal separation. MESSALA. Speak to her As thou proposest; and rely on me. TITUS. Distraction! She approaches! I am lost. SCENE III. TITUS, MESSALA, TULLIA, ALGINA. ALGINA. All things are ready; your commands alone Th'attendants wait. TULLIA. And must I then depart! O cruel sentence!âStill I feel his power; Th'ungrateful Titus haunts my peace of mind; While Brutus, like some god, in terrors clad, Appears, and aims the dreadful bolt betwixt us. Love, fear, and grief, commingling stir within Dire war, and urge me on to frenzy.âHaste! Let us away! TITUS. No, Tullia; I intreat theeâ TULLIA. Comest thou with insults or with treachery arm'd? What would'st thou? Unrelenting! TITUS. In this day Of horror, what I ought, is clear and plain. But, what I would! darkness, opposing clouds, Conceal the prospect; reason's friendly light I seek in vain, for thou hast torn it from me. I stand resign'd; guide on my steps, point out Their desperate course; with arbitrary sway My devious senses rule; and if thy foul Dares to proceed, make known the stern decree, Fixing the guilt, the baleful crimes of Titus. No; rather than behold these walls inwrapp'd In flames; or grim-eyed massacre destroy The citizens my valour hath preserved; Rather than my renown'd, my glorious father, Abandon'd by his fury-blinded son, Under the steel of Tarquinâ TULLIA. Save me, heaven! Nature's inspiring voice I hear, and bend With reverential duty; thou hast taught me What the mind feels, which trembles for a father; Indelibly impress'd it; Oh! remove These images of dread! Henceforth will Brutus An equal interest claim; the blood which feeds This beating heart, is all, for his, engaged. Our love, my nuptial bands, my life itself Are the thrice-sacred pledges; in thy charge Shall I remain, his daughter and his hostage. Still hesitating! Dost thou think, in secret That Brutus feels such infinite reluctance To see thee on a throne? Most true, his head Is yet uncrown'd; but doth he not possess Under another name th'essential form Of royalty? The sweets of sovereign power He must relinquish with th'expiring year, Which speedilyâAlas! When love is deaf, How weak are all my arguments!âOne wordâ And that shall terminate. I leave thee, Titus; And Oh! I leave thee, bearing in my soul The truest, purest ardour of affection. Thou weep'st, thou tremblest; still the time permitsâ Speak, say, what more can'st thou require of Tullia? TITUS. Thy hatred; that alone is wanting now To fill up the sad measure of my woes, And render them complete. TULLIA. Too long hath patience Insulted heard, and can no longer brook Thy unbecoming murmurs, idle ties, Complaints fictitious, and imagined wrongs. Take back thy love, which mine, with conscious shame, With scorn rejects; take back thy treacherous vows, More despicable to the mind sincere, Than e'en thy base refusal. But for me, Think not that I shall rove th'Italian states In quest of what I sacrifice to thee, Splendid and fatal honours; or will mourn Far from my country, in a monarch's arms, Th'emotions which in this unhappy bosom Thou only could'st inspire. No; I have fix'd My destiny; all-Roman as thou art, Whose native ruggedness of soul can urge No claim to virtue, but as nobly proved Against thy mistress; active and most brave In heaping miseries on me; shrinking back With fear, when I require thy aid, whose vows No bonds retain; now learn their sacred nature, Th'inviolable witnesses of truth. Thou shalt behold a woman, in thy eyes Tho' lowly in esteem, whose resolution No power can shake; and by the fortitude Arming this stedfast heart, shalt be convinced How firm, how pure, how constant is its love. Beneath these walls, where my forefathers reign'd, These walls which thy protecting hand secures, And bars their master's entrance; where, affronts And equal insults aiming, thou hast dared Me to betray; hast dared seduce my faith, And with infidious artifice beguile A soul without suspicion; here by all Those gods vindictive who their choicest plagues Reserve for perjury, I swear this arm, More just, and more determined far than thine, Shall with my blood efface the conscious stain Of every wrong, and punish the rash vision Which so imperfectly distinguish'd thee. Ungrateful! Yes, this instantâ [Going away. TITUS. From thy mind Oh! banish the dire purpose! Thou hast conquer'd, And shalt be satisfied. I yield; tho' all My nerves with terror thrill; by thy command Hurried impetuous onâThe sharpest anguish Doom'd to sustain, for thro' my bosom glides Not one illusive ray, no faint excuse Arises there; lost in the wild excess Of passion, even self-deceit with-holds Its sad and empty solace; love expands His eager wing, and raps me on to crimes. Thou could'st not blind, but hast o'ercome my reason. And totally unworthy to possess, The warm affection glowing in my soul, Glowing t'ward thee, I look with fondest eye On virtue, yet embrace detested guilt. Hate, shun me, fly from a polluted wretch, Who dying for thy love, beholds with shame, And loathes the fatal ardour. Who to gain Union with thee, the destined ties prepares, While blackest omens scoul around, mid deeds. Instinct with horror; where stern murder leads Her raging bands, and perjuries attend, A ghastly crew. TULLIA. Thou triumph'st o'er me, Titus, And my unhappy love survey'st with scorn, Insultingly upbraiding. Well thou know'st How willingly subjected, all my heart Is thine. For thee alone I wish to breathe This vital air; yes; wherefore should I hide My tenderest thoughts?âBut, tho' enslaved by love, Tho' conscious of my weakness, I should shrink With less reluctance from the dart of death, Than from the man, who fears to make me his: Who would repent the deeds which honour claims, And his much-injured prince: upon whose brow These hands have placed th'imperial diadem, Which his false shame rejects.âBut now the time, The dreadful minute of our separation, Approaches fast. Oh, Titus, to thy mind Recall my love, and raise thy thoughts to empire. Th'ambassador expects me; weigh it all, Consider well, the action, and the prize. An hour will bring me back, and with his daughter, Long exercised in woe, majestic Tarquin. Farewel! When next I view these hateful walls, Remember that I enter them a queen Or sink in death before thee. TITUS. Heaven avert The fatal stroke! This arm shall guardâ TULLIA. No more: Hold, Titus. Longer to be seen with me, Were dangerous; busy is suspicion's eye. Stay thou; farewel! Resolve this heart to pierce With mortal aim, or twine my nuptial wreathe. SCENE IV. TITUS. Thou hast prevail'd, inexorable maid, And Rome submits to bondage. Oh, return! Be thy dominion absolute o'er her As o'er my life! I fly to gain the crown, Or perish, for thee. To desert thy cause, That is a crime indeed of deepest die, Now for thy aid, for thy advice, Messala! Alas! My rash, my warm intemperate sallies The patience of his friendship have exhausted. Mistress, friends, Romans, all, all ravish'd from me In one pernicious day. SCENE V. TITUS, MESSALA. TITUS. Now let thy zeal Assist the mad'ning transports of my rage, And desperate love!âI lead the dangerous way. MESSALA. All is prepared; the necessary orders Give thou! My chosen cohorts are in arms On the quirinal mount, and will surrender Th'important pass. Men of unshaken valour; Ready to acknowledge thee the lawful heir Of Tarquin, and their solemn oaths to mix In firmest bond with mine. Haste! Seize at once Fleet opportunity! Already, lo, Night spreads her browner wing, to veil in shades Of deepest secrecy our great design. TITUS. The time draws near; and Tullia counting chides Each tardy moment.âHence! Vain, idle scruples! To Tarquin my fidelity is due, To him first sworn.âThe fatal die is cast. [The Scene opens, and discovers Brutus. O heavenly powers! My father! SCENE VI. BRUTUS, TITUS, MESSALA, LICTORS. BRUTUS. Titus, haste! Rome is in danger; every hope of safety Is fix'd on thee. By secret information The senate is apprized of an assault, At midnight's silent hour to be expected, The desperate effort of our foes. I sued, And have obtain'd for thee, my son, for thee, Whose soul heroic I regard with love More than paternal, the command in chief; Illustrious station from th'extremity Of peril, more illustrious; sacred proof Of confidence; and which th'assembled fathers Unanimous bestow'd. Take then thy arms, Son of my fond affection, lead the war, Again preserve thy country, pour thy blood Unsparing, nobly prodigal of life, And give a nation freedom. Go, my son, In such an hallow'd cause, if pale in death, Or on the car triumphant, I shall view thee With generous envy. TITUS. All-o'er-seeing gods! BRUTUS. Hah! Whence! And whatâ TITUS. To other hands commit The senate's favours, and the fate of Rome. MESSALA. What dire confusion in his troubled soul Now reigns! BRUTUS. Canst thou reject the splendid meed By glory offer'd? TITUS. Said'st thou, that on me?â Shall Iâ BRUTUS. Amazement! Doth thy erring heart Foster so long its wrath against the senate? Still rankling with the wound? Is this a time To listen to the dictates of caprice? And brood o'er fancied injuries? Myself Could not but see, and own thy claim unjust. Can he repine, whose virtue hath preserved His country from destruction? That high prize Immortally thy own, methinks should bound, Should satiate young ambition's utmost wish. Ne'er may a son of mine, before his years, Before the laws permit him to expect it, Dare ask the consulate! Seek thou no more, What justice must deny. Dost thou aspire To honour? I have placed thee in the rank, On which thick fall its radiant beams. There stand Conspicuous, and let tyrants only stir Thy kindling breast to anger. Both for thee, And for the state, warm beats my glowing heart With all a father's feelings. Consecrate Thy life to Rome, but nothing in return Demand. For ever cherish in thy soul A hero's sentiments, but add to these What still more nobly grace the citizen. Yet a few lagging steps, and I shall reach The period of my journey. Soon, my son, Shall thy victorious hands these eye-lids close. But in the bloom of thine, defying death, My name shall fresh survive. A new existence I shall enjoy, devoted to my country, And live in Titus.âWherefore this?âMy thoughts Now urge me where the present danger calls, Thy guidance to pursue. Tho' feeble age (Such is heaven's will) its active vigour lost, Breathes ineffectual courage; yet these eyes Shall see thee vanquish, or these limbs shall press The bloody dust with thine, th'avenger still Of Rome, still free, nor crouching to a tyrant. TITUS. Messala! Oh, what tortures! SCENE VII. BRUTUS, VALERIUS, TITUS, MESSALA. VALERIUS. Let me, Brutus, Engage a while thy private ear. BRUTUS. Away!â With busiest speed, my sonâ [Exeunt Titus and Messala. VALERIUS. By false children Rome is betray'd. BRUTUS. What accents dost thou utter Of evil import? VALERIUS. That a plot is form'd, No doubt remains; insidious treason lurks, And marks us for its prey; as yet unknown Who roused the fury from her horrid den. But Tarquin's name our echoing streets resound; Nay there are Romans who with abject voice Talk of submission. BRUTUS. Can a citizen Of Rome, solicit ignominious chains? VALERIUS. Dismay'd at my approach, thro' different paths The traitors fled: but they are close pursued. Menas and LÃ¦lius I suspect, th'abettors Of kingly right, and arbitrary power, Who view with secret spleen and discontent The rising glory of the state; their minds Eager, between the senate and the people To plant mistrust; Messala their protector: To whom I should impute this dark design Teeming with peril to the common weal, I should indeed at once condemn Messala, Did I not see him honour'd by thy son, Linkt in the strictest amity with Titus. BRUTUS. Let us with heedful care observe their steps, Trace all their winding progress! More than this Cannot be done. The liberty, the laws By us establish'd, violence forbid, And deeds severe, tho' haply necessary. On mere suspicion to detain a Romanâ Should not we act the tyrants? We, who raised O'er them the vengeful scourge? But let us haste, And mingle with the people? Our discourse Shall give to fear new vigour; animate With hope the faithful bosom; strike with dread, And blank astonishment the soul of guilt. Quick let the senate follow us! The fathers Of Rome and liberty shall soon restore To every heart its fortitude. What eye Beholding us, shall fail with ardent glance T'express the courage of the glowing breast Fresh-kindled! Gods! Let instant death be ours, Rather than bondage! SCENE VIII. BRUTUS, VALERIUS, PROCULUS. PROCULUS. At the door, a slave Requests a secret audience of the consul. BRUTUS. At night! At this unseasonable hour! PROCULUS. Tidings, he says, of most important nature He brings, a faithful witness of their truth. BRUTUS. On which perhaps the existence of the state Depends; lead on! To hesitate a moment Were to betray it. [To Proculus. Thou, my friend, to Titus! Bid him, above each post, with vigilance Guard the Quirinal gate. And may the world, From the bright fame of his atchievements, own The chosen race of Brutus is decreed To subjugate th'aspiring necks of kings!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. BRUTUS, SENATORS, PROCULUS, LICTORS, VINDIX A SLAVE. BRUTUS. Yes, Rome had now been lost; beneath the force Of tyranny, majestic freedom sunk To rise no more; for your reception death Had ope'd his gloomy mansion; o'er our heads Ruin inevitable hung; this night, This instant, Tarquin would have rush'd upon us, Grasping the terrors of revenge.âThis Tuscan With subtle art had scoop'd th'abyss, wide-stretch'd Under our feet, and doom'd us to destruction. But what will scarce acquire belief, there are Of Roman birth, who 'gainst their native land Conspiring, would have bent the servile knee Before a monarch's nod; their ignorant Misjudging passions, guided by Messala, Who to the treacherous Aruns scrupled not To sell his country. This with sleepless eye Heaven saw, and warded off the fatal stroke O'er Rome, o'er you impending. The discourse Of Aruns by this faithful slave o'er-heard. [Shewing Vindix. His apprehensive mind suspected thence The guilty consequence, to me he brought His loyal information, all my fears Awakening for the public good, and all My active zeal rekindling. Strait I order'd Messala to be seized, and brought before you. Seeing his well-earn'd punishment prepared, I hoped the traitor would, by fear compell'd, Have named his base accomplices. Around him My Lictors stood, when on a sudden, forth He drew a dagger, whose fell point perhaps For you was sharpen'd, and exclaim'd aloud, âWould you my secrets learn? This mortal wound âContemplate! Trace them in my heart's warm blood! âHe who hath boldly dared conspire against you, âKnows to conceal his purposes, and die.â Then, e'er the astonish'd Lictors could advance, Pierced his false breast, and tho' his crimes disgraced The glorious title, like a Roman sell. Aruns meanwhile had left the walls, the guards Pursued him to the borders of the camp, Securing him and Tullia. Soon each dark And tangled maze of this destructive plan Heaven will, I trust, unfold. Publicola Will drag the traitors from their secret haunts. But when the parricides shall stand confest, Romans, beware! Against them steel your souls, And banish mercy! Should our eyes behold Friends, brothers, children, let each tender thought Be in their guilt extinguish'd, and regard Your solemn oath alone. Rome, liberty, Demands that they should suffer; to bestow Pardon on them, were to partake their crimes. [To the Slave. Thou, on whose birth, erroneous fortune stamp'd The seal of slavery, when she ought t'have given A Roman to the world! To whom the senate Owes this fair light of day; from whom the state Derives its safety, be the freedom thine, To them, to me imparted: and henceforth To nobler views aspiring, with my sons Claim equal rank; like them the dread of kings. But hark! What sudden shouts! PROCULUS. Th'ambassador Seiz'd by the guards, I have conducted hither. BRUTUS. With what assurance can he dareâ SCENE II. BRUTUS, SENATORS, ARUNS, LICTORS. ARUNS. How long Will you with sacrilege, injurious Romans, Man's general rights invade? The people viewing All objects in rebellion's treacherous mirrour, Is it your purpose in their ministers, To shew your scorn of kings? Back to these walls Your Lictors with ill-manner'd violence Have forced me to return; my royal master Would you insult? Or is it a disgrace Levell'd at me! The rank which I sustain, Among all nations sacredâ BRUTUS. Be it so, That argument condemns thee; for the more Thy station is revered, in stronger light Shines forth thy guilt. An empty name alone, And its superfluous honour, boast not here. ARUNS. Sent from a king, shall an ambassadorâ BRUTUS. Thou an ambassador! No; with deceit And treachery mark'd, we see before us stand A base conspirator. Adorn'd indeed With an illustrious title; underneath Its sanction perpetrating direst crimes; Bold in nefarious deeds, because he thinks He may offend unpunish'd. How unlike The genuine character of that high office Thou but assumest! The true ambassadors Are they who to the spirit of the laws Firmly adhere; who know to serve their prince, Not fix the stain of infamy upon him. With cautious wisdom locking in their breasts Th'intrusted faith of treaties; nought but peace Springs from their interposing ministry, Fruit of their hallow'd toil. With bands most pure They knit in just and strict accord together The sovereigns of the earth. Where'er they move Diffusing blessings, and where'er they move Survey'd with veneration. In this portrait Find, if thou canst, a stroke resembling thee. But thou at least hast proved a faithful spy, And to thy master art prepared t'unfold Our actuating principles, the virtues, The constitution of our state; now learn Rome's proper temper; mark what sentiments Inspire her senate; this exalted race With holiest awe reveres the right of nations, Which thou hast dared to violate. The more By thee unheeded, with superior care Shall they protect them. Know then, we award No other punishment, but to behold The death of those perfidious citizens Who leagued in horrid plot with thee, had seal'd Our general massacre. Stain'd with their blood, Before thee spilt, go and inform thy master Of the successless crime. A living witness To all Italia, of the Roman manners, What honour and what sanctity is theirs, What baseness and what ignominy thine. Hence!âLictors, do your office! SCENE III. SENATORS, BRUTUS, VALERIUS, PROCULUS. BRUTUS. Say, Valerius, The traitors doubtless thou hast apprehended, At least they all are known? Hah! whence that cloud Darkening thy brow! That melancholy aspect Which seems as if portending greater ills, Calamities more dreadfully severe? These tremors whence? VALERIUS. Remember thou art Brutus. BRUTUS. What dost thou mean?â VALERIUS. I shudder at the thought, Its aid my tongue refuses. [Gives him the Tablets. In this list, Read, know the guilty. BRUTUS. Do my eyes deceive me? O day most hateful! O most wretched father! The name of Tiberinus! Of my son!â Forgive this weakness.âIs the traitor seized? VALERIUS. With two of the conspirators he dared Oppose the course of justice; and resolved, Rather, than yield, on death, beside them fell Cover'd with wounds. But, Oh! A tale more dire Remains for thee, for all the sons of Rome; To me more exquisitely painful. BRUTUS. Hah! What am I to expect! VALERIUS. Again behold That fatal catalogue, which from Messala By Proculus was wrested. BRUTUS. Give it meâ Let me behold it.âWhy these fears? This horror? Eternal guardians! Titus! [He sinks into the Arms of Proculus. VALERIUS. Near this place I found him wand'ring, in despair, unarm'd, He seem'd as panic-struck, and full of terror; Haply reflecting on th'attempt which now Shocks every sense, an enterprize abhorr'd BRUTUS. Go, conscript fathers, to your sacred dome Return; no station in th'assembled senate Dare I again assume. Go, extirpate My guilty race; punish the sire himself; Nor by false mercy sway'd refrain to pierce This heart, the source of their polluted blood. I shall not follow you; lest in my presence, Rome should suspend her judgment, or pull back The hand of vengeance. SCENE IV. BRUTUS. [Alone. Powers supreme! Who rule With might resistless! To whose high decrees My soul, and every secret wish it breathes, Submissive bends! Ye gods, who have revenged Our violated laws! Who have revenged My injured country! By whose aid these hands On the strong base of justice, have upraised The fame of freedom, built, as it appear'd, To last thro' endless ages! Would you sink The holy structure level with the dust? Hath your impulsive spirit urged my children Against your own celestial work?âAlas! That Tiberinus, blind with headstrong rage, Should seek t'obey a tyrant, and reduce His country to the yoke of servitude! Most grievous was the stroke, for tho' a traitor, He was my son. But, Titus! In whose breast Dwelt each heroic virtue, upon whom Rome gazed, enamour'd! Who this very day Shone forth the minion of success; full fraught With glory's brightest gifts; by victory led, And placed aloft in her triumphal car! Crown'd by my hands with laurel, while with shouts The capitol resounded; whom my age With fondest hope regarded; on whose worth The total state relied! That he! that Titus! All-powerful gods! SCENE V. BRUTUS, VALERIUS, ATTENDANTS, LICTORS. VALERIUS. The senate hath resolved, To thy determination to submit The sentence of thy son. BRUTUS. To mine! VALERIUS. His fate On thee alone depends. BRUTUS. How of the rest Have they disposed? VALERIUS. All who conspired besides Have been condemn'd; e'en now perhaps they feel The mortal stroke. BRUTUS. And is his destiny Referr'd to me? The fathers of their country, Have they to my arbitrement decreed The life or death of Titus? of my son? VALERIUS. It is a signal honour, which they thought Due to thy virtues. BRUTUS. O my country! VALERIUS. What, Shall I inform the senate, is thy answer? BRUTUS. That Brutus sees, and values, as he ought, A favour so distinguish'd; freely given, And unsolicited; nor shall he prove Unworthy of the trust.âBut, Titus yielded Without resistance; could he thenâForgive me, If I am anxious to find grounds for doubt. To him Rome owes her freedom; and affection Cannot at once its pleasing thoughts resign, My heart still t'ward him beats. VALERIUS. Th'unhappy Tulliaâ BRUTUS. Say, what of Tullia? VALERIUS. Hath too well confirm'd The truth of our suspicions. BRUTUS. How, Valerius? VALERIUS. Brought back with shame and anguish to our walls, When her sad eyes beheld the dreadful scene Of punishment prepared; her hand completing The melancholy sacrifice, she fell, She breathed her last; thus offering to our laws, Ill-fortuned maid, the sole remaining branch From a vile tyrant sprung.âIf Titus err'd, If strongly tempted, he betray'd his country, She was the cause.âMy heart reveres thee, Brutusâ I venerate a father's sacred grief; But Tullia when expiring, hither cast Her eyes, scarce struggling with th'incumbent weight, And call'd on Titus. BRUTUS. Oh, all-righteous gods! VALERIUS. Thou art his judge; whether thou strike the victim, Save, or condemn; Rome cannot but approve What Brutus shall determine. BRUTUS. Lictors, hence! Bring Titus strait before me. VALERIUS. I retire, While all my bosom, by thy virtue fill'd, Dilated swells. Astonishment and pity With admiration join as I behold thee. I go with awe imprest, to represent Th'excess of thy affliction to the senate, And thy unshaken fortitude of soul. SCENE VI. BRUTUS, PROCULUS. BRUTUS. No; every circumstance within my mind The more I scan, the less can I imagine My son would treason's fatal snares inweave For Rome's destruction. This, his filial love, The zeal with which he ever served his country, Must have opposed. It was not possible In one short day thus to forget himself, And each firm-rooted principle destroy. Away, intruding thoughts!âHe is not guilty. PROCULUS. Perhaps Messala, in whose wily brain This execrable plot was formed, might seek A shelter under his illustrious name; Or who can say what envy might contrive, Observing with a cloud his radiant beams, Dazzled by too much glory? BRUTUS. Grant it, Heaven! PROCULUS. At least he is thy son, thy only hope; And whether it appears he join'd or not In the conspiracy; th'indulgent senate To thee resign his fate. His life is safe, Whilst in thy hands: thou wilt preserve the hero, Preserve him for the public; add to this, Thou art a father. BRUTUS. And a Roman consul. SCENE VII. BRUTUS, PROCULUS, TITUS. [At the farther End of the Stage, conducted by the Lictors.] PROCULUS. See where he comes! TITUS. Hah, Brutus! how I sink Beneath th'oppressive weight of grief and shame. These trembling limbsâOpen, thou solid earth, And in thy central darkness ever hide me! Wilt thou permit thy sonâ BRUTUS. Presumptuous, hold! No farther! Lately I possess'd two children, How dear to this fond heart, witness, ye gods, Who gave them to me! One, alas! is lost. One, said I? Oh, thou most unhappy Titus! Speak, have I yet a son? TITUS. No son is thine. BRUTUS. Now then, attend thy judge, attend and answer, My stain, and my disgrace! [He seats himself. Could'st thou resolve T'enslave thy country? To betray thy father Into the hands of lawless power? To sport With perjury, and break thy sacred oaths? TITUS. I had resolved on nothing; but my soul With deadly poison fill'd, its very essence Infected, plague-struck, to its horrid force Compell'd to yield; the knowledge of myself Was ravish'd from me, and in vain I strive E'en now for recollection. Wand'ring still In a delirious maze, my heart which then By frenzy urged, left reason far behind, Was guilty for a moment. That short space O'erwhelm'd me with eternal shame, and stamp'd Deep on my brow the mark of treason. Gods! Of treason to the country which I prized With sumless estimation.âMadness fled; Reason soon came, and with it brought remorse, Dreadful its stings, its tortures are immense, And equal to my crime; Rome could not take Severer punishment in its just vengeance. Pronounce my doom. The common-weal requires My forfeit life; all eyes are fix'd on thee, And an example ought to be display'd Great and conspicuous; so, withheld by terror At my deserved fate, no son of Rome Shall dare hereafter to pursue my steps. And as thro' life, so in the hour of death, I still shall serve my country. While the blood Always expended for her sake, unstain'd In its pure course till this pernicious day, Shall, as it wont, be from my heart pour'd forth, And only flow for liberty. BRUTUS. I hear With wonder! How, with perfidy so base, Accords this generous ardour! Blackest crimes, (Horrid assemblage!) with the brightest virtues In union join'd!âHeaven! With the laurels crown'd, And mid the trophied ensigns, to my eyes More beauteous for the sanguine stains they bore, What envious demon breathed into thy heart This levity and fickleness so dire, And so unparallel'd? TITUS. All, all the passions With inimical power; the thirst of vengeance, Ambition, hatred, the fierce sudden rage Of madly-wild despairâ BRUTUS. Unhappy youth! Proceed! TITUS. One error more transcending all. A flame which captive led, and still retains O'er my subjected senses uncontroul'd An absolute dominion; which at first Quicken'd my guilt, and now perhaps augments it. But wherefore should I thus confess my shame? Odious to thee, and painful were th'avowal, Rome needs it not; the sire and son must blush At th'unbecoming tale. Now my misfortunes Are at their height, th'emotions of my soul Can in their furious progress rush no farther. My crimes, my desperation, and my life Here terminate at once; a life to thee, To me, reproachful, teeming with disgrace. But if in battle I have trod thy steps, If I have strove to emulate thy deeds, If I have loved my country, if my guilt Pursued by keen remorse, I feel the pang Sufficiently severe; Oh, deign one more In thy paternal arms to clasp a son [Kneeling. Bent to the ground with anguish! Say, at least, Thy father hates thee not; that word alone Shall snatch my memory from the gulph of shame In which I now am plunged. It shall be told To late posterity, that Titus sunk not To the dark regions of the dead, unblest By a kind look from thee, the great reward Of his sincere contrition; that he still Preserved an interest in thy heart, and bore, Spite of his crimes, bore with him to the tomb Thy favour and esteem. BRUTUS. I feel his anguish! It overpowers me!âMust it be?âO Rome! O genius of my country!âProculusâ Call thou the lictors hither, bid them lead My son to death.âRise, wretched Titus! Rise! Object of my aversion, of my love And tenderest sympathy! My age's hope! Dear to its partial sight! And fondly deem'd Its sure support!âApproach! Embrace thy father! Who could not but condemn thee! yet had seal'd Frankly thy pardon, had he not been Brutus. Witness these sighs, these tears, which as I speak, Descend upon thee!âGo, and meet thy fate With steadier fortitude? Go, look on death Calm and unmoved, with more of Roman firmness Than I can boast! And while thy country claims Its vengeance due, let it admire thy fall. TITUS. This last embrace! Farewel! the mortal stroke ImpendsâEnough! I meet it with a soul Still worthy of my father. SCENE VIII. BRUTUS, PROCULUS. PROCULUS. All the senate Struck with sincerest grief, and thrill'd with horror The dire event which on thy headâ BRUTUS. No more: Know'st thou not Brutus! Shall he now attend The voice of consolation! Think whose arms Surround us, with new-kindled rage again Mars calls us to the field.âTo Rome alone My cares belong; she every thought inspires. Away! Her sons in this disastrous hour Demand that I should fill his vacant place Whom I bade bleed for them. At least I thus Shall reach the goal of my sad life, and die, As Titus ought, the champion of my country. SCENE THE LAST. BRUTUS, PROCULUS, A SENATOR. SENATOR. Brutus! Alasâ BRUTUS. My son is dead? SENATOR. He isâ These eyes survey'dâ BRUTUS. Thank we the bounteous gods! Their glorious work is perfect; Rome is free. END OF THE FIFTH ACT.</field>
