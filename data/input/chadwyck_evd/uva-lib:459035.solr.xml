      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Gallants, be't known as yet we cannot say To whom you are beholding for this play; But this our Poet hath licens'd us to tell, Ingenious Italy hath lik'd it well: Yet is it no translation; for he nere But twice in Venice did it ever hear; There it did take, and he doth hope (if you Have your old humors) it will please here too. He swears he hath not spoil'd it, and protest We think it good, though he doth none ot'h best; You often have heard worse it'h house before, And had we made the Prologue wee'd say more That labour he hath sav'd us, cause he wood No partial friend should crie it up for good; An excellent new Comedy as you say, When you have seen't, he so will judge his play come He is not peremptory, like to some Who think that all is best from them doth Ladies and Gentlemen, you that do know To censure rightly as you think so do: Our Poet scornes to beg your hands, yet saith, That at the end if he the favour hath, This shall not be his last, that he'l endeavour To gratifie you shortly with another: How ere it takes, he for your presence sends His thankes by me, and hopes we shall part friends</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus scena prima. Enter Trappolin solus. My wench Flametta is a dear rogue, the pretty fool dotes on me; my Lord Barbarin can do nothing with her; his pistols and jewels she cares not for. And tis a handsome thing: no Pomatum ere toucht her lips, or paint her cheeks, yet are they cherries and roses; I am most happy to be what I am, and to have the love of such a one as she. Enter Flametta. Flam. Good morrow Trappolin, how does my Love? Trap. First let us kiss, and after I will tell, For ever thine Flametta. Flam. O thanks my dear. Enter Barbarino. Bar. The villain Trappolin has a handsome wench, and (which angers me) an honest one; I have spent many weeks about her, but could never do any good, she will not neither for love or money; and see where they are a talking together. Trap. Yonder is my Lord Barbarino. My dear Flametta, I am your Honours servant; this free promise of thine, I can never enough thanke thee for—at your Lordships command. How happily shall we live together in marriage, both loving so well and truly? Your Honours humble slave. Let us kiss agen,—your poor vassal my Lord, thus will we spend our daies in these delights; so will we kiss Flametta—I beseech your Honour to pardon me: we nere will be a weary of our selves, if thou dost sigh, thy Trappolin will weep,—your Honour shall command me alwaies; and when thou singst thy Trappolin will dance. Flam. And I am thine my honest Trappolin, And ever will be constant unto thee. Trap. I'le attend your Honour presently. Flam. There's no man alive shall make me prove Unfaithful unto thee, so much I love. Trap. Your Lordship must pardon me a little, I am something busie. Flam. My Trappolin shall not bestow a kiss, But I will pay it him with usury; It is impossible for thee to be More thy Flametta's then Flametta's thine. Trap. I will come to your Honour presently. Flam. Pardon Sweetheart that now I must be gone, My stay another time shall make amends: A kiss, my dear, my lovely Trappolin; With such I shall be never satisfied. Exit. Trap. Farewel my dear rogue; my Lord I come, Your Honour must pardon me, you saw how I was employ'd, I could not leave the poor fool, your Lordship sees she loves me, and protest her labour is not lost: now if your Honour hath any thing to command me, I am ready Trappolino, your poor servant. Barb. You are a sawcy peremptory villain, And I have well perceiv'd your base demeanor; Although I see the wench is yours, you shall Repent the freedome of your evil language, Be sure you shall. Exit. Trap. Good morrow my Lord, Let him do his worst I care not a rush for him; he would ha my wench, and I am glad I abus'd him, I ha made his Honour something collerick, let him disgest it how he will. Exit. Enter Lavinio the great Duke, Prudentia, Barbarin, Machavil and others. Lavin. The Tuscane glory have we yet upheld, And from the fierce assaults of enemies Rescued our cities, set them in a peace As happy as the Gods did ere vouchsafe. Sforza the Duke of Milain our old friend, Who hath in all our wars still sent us aide, Hath promised me the matchless Isabella His sister for my wife; and seeing now We have no more to do with enemies, I will to Milain go and marry her, And quickly unto Florence will return, Where I will celebrate our nuptial With that magnificence becomes our state. You, whom I ever have found faithful to me, Lord Barbarino, and Lord Machivil, To you I do commit the government Of Tuscany until I return; And full commission to do what you shall See necessary for the good of Florence: My dear Prudentia, the onely joy Of our deceased Father, the last Duke, Live happy, and enjoy thy own desires, Which I do know are vertuous all. Prud. Most noble Sir, it is impossible That I should happy be, and you not present: But I am unworthy to beseech your stay; Go and be fortunate in a worthy choice, While I to heaven pray for your safe return. Dear sweet Prudentia, and also Lords, Look well unto my prisoner Brunetto; Yet let him want nothing but a free release, For sure he is more then he seems to be. I have been long about this journey, now All things are ready, my Prudentia Farewel; and sister, be not melancholy, For in few weeks I will return, and bring A sister home to keep thee company, The beauteous Milanes. Prud. And may she prove According to your wishes, noble Sir. Barb. And be a joy unto the Florentines. Mach. And be a happy mother, that there may Not want an heir unto your Highness. Lav. Our thanks; Onward, tis time I were upon my way. Exeunt. Barba. Now will I be reveng'd of Trappolin, Who hath so boldly to my face abus'd me; I have authority to do't withall, I'le make him to repent his sawciness. Enter Trappolin. He's here, but I will do't as if by Justice. Trap. I can think of nothing but my pretty villain Flammetta; O 'tis a dear rogue, and she saies she loves me, and I know she does: when I have married her I will betake me to the country, where we will live as jovial as the day is long.— Enter Mattemoros the Spanish Captain. Mat. I'le fight for Florence while I have a vein To hold my heart from falling unto death; Nor shall the Longobardy Mantuaus Ere win a Flag while I am in the field; I'de make the Tuscan Duke to know the man Whom he hath trusted to conduct his troops, Durst but Gonzaga ever stir again. Methinks there is no nobler thing on earth, Then to see hills of bodies, lakes of blood: No braver Musick then the Martial Drum; Nor Diapasons sweeter to the ear, Then unto it the Warlike Trumpets make; When I but hear this harmony, I could, Full of delight, venter my single person Against an armed Troop. Away with peace, It is the Canker and the bane of minds; 'Tis that which makes us to forget our selves, And spend our lives in sensuality. Then glorious war advance thy armed arm, That soldiers may have waies to shew themselves; Wo'd Gothes and Vandals once again would come Int' Italy, or Moors into our Spain, That Mattemoros might wear out his sword With hewing bones, and cleaving armed men: Each thing doth to his centre fall, and I Would unto mine, which is to fight or die. Who art thou? Trap. I! Matte. I you! what are you to good to be asked? Trap. I am Trappolin. Matte. By that I know not, art thou a man of war? Is Trappolin in any Captains roll? I'st writ? Trap. Yes (Seignior Captain) in the Parsons book, The day thereof my baptisme is set down. Mat. And in that honour oft hast thou ere fought With Infidels, and slain a score or two? Trap. Not I, Heavens be prais'd, a score or two said you Captain? then should I sure never escape, for I promise you many an one is hang'd for killing of one. Mat. Fie, what an ignorance is this! hast thou a mind to become now a souldier? Trap. Indeed, Seignior Captain, I cannot resolve you as yet, I am about a wife, Ile ask her if she will turn souldier too, and then if I like it ther's an end. But I pray you Captain what is a souldier? Mat. A souldier, Trappolin, is he that does Venter his life a hundred times a day, VVood in his countries, and his Princes cause Stand canon shot, and wood of steeled pikes; VVood when his bodie's full of wounds all night, Lie in the field and sleep upon his helm. Trap. Good Captain pardon me, neither I nor Flametta will be souldiers; heavens defend, venter my life so many times a day! there is more safety and gain in turning thief: I love my countrey and Prince well, but my self better; 'tis good sleeping in a whole skin, tis better lying with Flametta in a warm bed; marry I had thought a souldier had not been such a fool. How many of them might there be in Florence, Sir Captain? Mat. Thou coward, many hundreds. Trap. The Gods send them more wit, thats eene all that I can say: but I pray you Sir Captain, now I think ont't perswade my Father and mother, sisters and uncles, and aunts, and all the kin I have to turn souldiers, that they may be kil'd quickly and I be their heir; I swear Captain you should lose nothing by't, I would give you a good present for't. Mat. Base coward. Trap. Good Captain, what is the meaning of coward? I have often heard that word, and would fain know the true meaning of it. Mat. A coward is a fellow base as thou, One that doth spend his precious time in sloth, Cares not what alterations kingdomes have, So he at home may welter in his pleasures; A fellow that had rather sit all day Drinking tobacco, and carousing cups, Then die his sword in blood of enemies. Trap. VVhy then Captain, in faith I am a very coward; tis better by half then a souldier, I know there is far more pleasure in a glass of good wine and a pipe of true Varines, then in bullets whizzing about ones ears, and pikes or halberts, or what you will abeating out ones teeth. Mat. Thou dunghil wretch. Trap. Seignior Captain, be not angry, for I vow I mean earnest, I should never digest the souldiery life, nor am I sure wood Flametta, and the Gods help them that do. Matte. Thou earthen-minded slave, tis pity thou shouldest eat or drink that hast no better thoughts, Trap. Not as long as I pay for't; what the Devil have I to do with your souldery Sir Captain? give me leave to be of my own mind, and a Coward; for i'me sure no wise man but wood say as I do, let those follow your wars that are aweary of their lives. Matte. Thou art as dunghil a minded Rascal as ere I heard in my life; I would not for any thing thou wast a Spaniard, thou wouldst be a slander to the whole Nation. And Villain, I tell thee if thou wert one, I would kill thee; Mattemoros would do it, and so I leave it. Exit. Trap. Farewel my Sir Don, go hang your self, what have I to do with your wars tro? for nothing would I venter to fight but Flametta, and for her I durst not exceed about at fifty Cuffs, or a bout with a little pair of Cudgels at the most: I should never endure to shoot off a Gun, not I, the very noise of it would make me endanger my Breeches, Enter Horatio. Brunetto, honest Brunetto, how dost do? be merry man, this time will have an end man, and till it come be as jovial as thou canst, thou wouldst ene a blest thy self to a seen how I vext the patience of my Lord Barbarin. Horat. You have not sure. Trap. Marry but I have, and to the purpose too. Horat. Then you are undone Trappolin. Trap. Why man? Horat. The Duke has left him and the Lord Machavil governours till his return, Trap. The Devil he has. Horat. Tis very true. Trap. Troth then I am but little better I fear. Enter Officers. 1. Thats he, 2. Lay hold on him. Trap. Brunetto, I am undon, thy Trappolin must to the Jayle, pray you my small friends give me leave to speake but one word, Remember me to my sugar-candy Flametta. 3. Away with him. 4. To prison with the saucy Rogue. Exeunt. Horat. I came to Mantoa to ayde the Duke My Uncle gainst his foes the Florentines, Where hearing every man to praise the beauty Of sweet Prudentia, the report did win me; Being taken in the wars, I was not sad, Because I was to go where she did live: But seeing so many Princes all desirous To marry her, I knew the great Duke never Would bestow her on Savoyes second Son. And therefore yet I have concealed my self; Nor doth she know I am Horatio: For want of opportunity I yet Could nere so much as sigh within her hearing. Enter Prudentia and Hipolita. Hipo. The Lady Isabella, by her picture, May be supposed to be a matchless fair one; Each feature of her face is wondrous good, And her fine head of hair's a curious colour. Prud. In her we shall be happy all, for she The world reports hath equal to her forme A noble and a vertuous mind; Whose that? Hipo. He is your brothers prisoner, called Brunetto, That in the wars of Mantoa was took. Prud. Tis a handsome man. Hipo. And thought by all the Court a Gentleman Of good descent, but he hath not disclosed His parentage to any. Prude. Why doth he not? Hipol. That no man knows yet besides himself. Prud. How melancholy he doth seem? Hipo. He hath good cause for it Madam: Who can be merry in Captivity? Pruden. Tis true; A Gentleman of good descent suppos'd, I never saw a man of braver Carriage, Nor one that pleas'd me better then he doth; Aha! Hipo. Why sigh you Madam? Prud. To think of fortune; perhaps this prisoner Is of a house as good as the Medices, Hath lived before the wars of Mantua, In all the happiness you could desire, And now we see him thus. Hipol. Methinks I hear him sigh. Prud. And so do I. Hipo. He's gone. Exit Horatio. Prud. But with how sad a gate? Methinks I am not as I was before. Hipolita. Hip. Madam. Prud. Preethee go tune my Lute, I have a mind To sing a little, I shall forget to play If I so seldome use it. Hip. I go Madam. Exit Hipolita. Prud. I have sent her hence that I might search my heart, For sure it is not as it lately was; It is so full of thoughts, I cannot find The free access into it I had wont: What should the reason be, what have I don To breed this alteration? nothing I, Ere I came here I felt my self as free From this strange—what it is I cannot tell, The place is not bewitched sure, nor have I seen ought but this hapless prisoner. Alas poor Gentleman, (for in his looks And in his carriage I can guess him such) How little to the fates art thou beholding To let thee live a prisoner thus? how now! What i'st I say, talk of Brunetto? Oh, I am in Love, the Gods will have it so. Exit. Scena tertia. Enter Barbarino, Machavil, Mattemoros, and Officers leading Trappolin after them. Barb. This man, Lord Machavil, is one of those That doth in Florence nourish vice, he is A pander, one that if he sees a stranger, Straight makes acquaintance with him, for what end Your self may guess; so he may gain thereby He would betray our daughters, lead our sons To Brothels, vicious and full of rottenness. Trap. I wonder how the Divel he came to know any thing that I did. Barb. This writing yesternight was presented to me: Here you may see what enormities he is guilty of. Trap. His Lordship would shew himself a great hater of bawdery. Mach. Tis good we did examine him. Mat. And there is not such a coward in Tuscany; He's able to corrupt an army. Trap. Seignior Captain, never fear it, for I nere mean to come into one. Barb. Bring him before us. Trap. Ah that I durst tell my Lords Excellence why he deals thus with me, tis for a wench, and yet how eager he is against bawdery. Offic. Forward Trappolin, go before their Excellencies. Barb. Sirra, this paper doth not onely shew You are a rogue, your looks declare you one, Thou hast as ill a face as ere I saw. Trap. And yet Flametta think'st as good as his, I did not lie and if I said a better. Mac. Ere we come to his pandarisme, I'le examine him about other matters; Sir do you never use to carry pistols about you? Trap. Sometimes and please your Excellence I do. Bar. Write down that Notarie. Trap. What does your Lordship mean, I did not steal them. Mac. I know well enough what I do; sirra, you went to shoot some body. Trap. Beseech your Honour to take me along with you, I meant money. Mach. That's vain, then Notarie tear it out. Barb. Do you nere carry other armes neither? Trap. Many times my Lord. Barb. Notarie down with it, he shall be talk'd with for that. Trap. Your Honour is deceiv'd agen, I mean onely armes upon seales, or scutchions from the Heralds. Mac. This is nothing Notarie, tear it out. Barb. A pimp I'me sure he is. Mac. Do you never carry no Love Letters, as from a Gentleman to a Lady, or a Gentlewoman to a Cavalier, or so? Trap. O very oft my Lord. Barb. Do you so indeed? Notarie write it down. Trap. Your Honour must understand me, Letters of Love, of friendship, as when a Lady writes unto her brother at Siena, a wife to her husband at Pisa, a son to his mother at such a place, a father to his daughter married at such a town, I am often hired, and carry them to the Post. Mac. Notarie, you must tear out this too. Barb. But sirra, to come nearer to the matter, Do you not keep intelligence with Whores? Have you nere plaid the Ruffian? by your means Hath no man been provided of a lodging? Trap. This I have no excuse for, the whole city knowes me a pimp. Aside. And that it is very nigh my living. Mac. What say you sirra? Trap. My Lords, I am but a poor fellow, and must live. Barb. By Bawdery? Trap. Tis but a friends part. Mac. A wicked ones, Notarie down with this at large. Trap. Alas my Lord, what hurt is it, if I help a Gentleman to a sound wench, where is there any fault? good your Honours, consider me, think not I am a man alone in this business, that many others live by it as well as I. Bar. What an impudency is this? Not onely to do ill, but to defend it, Is a transgression exceeds forgiveness. Trap. Good my Lord take pity on me, wel a day what should I do! I have not onely done a favour in it for my self, but also a courtesie for many a Gentleman. Mach. Do not teare out that, Notarie. Trap. Beseech your Honours let him tear't out. Barb. What shall we do with this villain? Mac. Why let's hang him and ther's an end of him. Trap. That's true I faith, consider my Lords, that never man was put to death for such a matter, but rather that they have been beloved, and well paid by noble men and cavalieres. Mach. Had we not best to condemn him to the Gallies? or lets banish hm. Barb. I that's the best. Trap. Beseech your Honours pity me. Mac. After to morrow, Trappolin, if thou be'st seen in Florence thou shalt die, be hang'd; we banish thee for term of life, therefore prepare against to morrow to be gone. Trap. Pray your Honours. Bar. Notarie, write down he's banish't. Mac. You rogue, it is irrevocable, and therefore make you ready. Trap. I think I am the first man that ever was banish't for such a matter; were all of my profession in the City served so, I think we should make an Army Royal of us. Barb. This matter is concluded, Trappolin; Go seek your fortune. My Lord Machavil; We may depart. Exeunt. Matte. Thou man of durt, hadst thou a Souldier been, This banishment had never been pronounc'd. Trap. But Sir Captain, I fear I should have been kil'd, which is worse. Matte. If for thy Country, t'had been a noble death. Trap. I had rather live Cap. then die nobly. Matte. Thou man compos'd of sand, in vain I spend My breath to talk with such a slave as thou; Go and be hang'd, for so thou do dost deserve, And might I judge thee, it should be thy end. Exit. Trap. Thou brazen-headed Coxcomb, may'st thou go to the divel with a Drum before thee; I had as leeve be banish't out of my Country and walk in peace, as be out on't in the wars. Enter Horatio. Brunetto, O Brunetto, I must leave thee, I must be gone Man to morrow, farewell Florence. Hora. Why, whats the matter Trappolin? Trap. Why, I have banish't the Lord Barberino, and the Lord Machavil. Hora. How! you banish't them? Trap. They have banished me, or I them, 'tis all one, I must be gone, and the divel a bit a mony I have: shall I help thee to a Wench Brunetto? Or if thou hast no mind to one, know'st thou any body that has? I'de fain be earning a little mony. Hora. I wish thee well, live honest Trappolin, And so thou shalt be sure to prosper better; This Ring I give thee, sell it, and the mony Spend to maintain thee. Trap. Honest Brunetto, faith An ere I can I will require thee fully; Farewell, I must also take my leave Of my Flametta, we shall cry together Like unto School Boys that are to be whipt. Exit. Hora. Alas poor simple Trappolin, I pity Thy fortune, yet 'tis better far then mine; Of all mankind I am most miserable, And lead a life would make a soul prove mortal, Yet do I not repine: Most dear Prudentia, I never can endure enough for thee, So that at last I may attain my wishes: There's not a grief mankind did ever suffer, Nor pain, I would not pass to make thee mine; Thou art the Centre of my wishes, all Horatio's thoughts upon thy beauty fall. Enter Prudentia. Prud. O Heavens, be merciful, and if I tell Him I am his, let him say he is mine; I have a fire within my breast must out, Longer I cannot hide it, if he now Do's not wooe me, I shall solicite him. How sad a pace he walks? how melancholy Do's he look? Love compels us unto things In others we would scorn; I'le speak unto him, Because I fear he dares not unto me. Brunetto. Hora. Divinest Lady. Prud. I thought a Gentleman (for so I guess you) Could have endured affliction better far, That in the wars durst venter so his person. Hora. Most Excellent Princess, many thousand men Can suffer well the dangers of a battel, But there are few or none at all that can Bear out the passions of a mind afflicted. Prud. Then you are discontent: Alas, you long for Your liberty, and (truth) I cannot blame you. Hora. Then should I hate my self, being a slave to one Whom I desire evermore to serve. Ye that command the destinies of men, Now let me die, and if I shall not prosper: Know, Noblest Lady, that the prisoner That speaks unto you is a Prince by birth; I am Horatio, second son unto The Duke of Savoy, and the Piemondt Prince; At Mantoa the fame of your perfections Captiv'd my soul, and when that I was took, I did account my self a happy man, Being to go where you did live; I know, Most dearest Princess, that I am unworthy So great a happiness as is your love; Yet if you deny me, witness heaven, I never will return unto Turin, But here die languishing for your refusal. The Duke my father soon would pay my ransom, But thraldom for your sake I have esteemed Above liberty and pleasures of a Court. Prud. My thanks, most gracious heavens—Brunetto is A Prince, most worthy brave Horatio, I scorn to dally with my happiness, Like some that love to counterfeit their joys; Know I do love thee dear as my own soul, And that if thou hadst now been silent, I My heart unto thee had disclosed, live happy, And if it in my power lies thou shalt. Hora. Doubt, fear, despaire be gone, I am a man That envy not the blessed lives of Kings; Now she hath dain'd to say these happy words, I care not though all mankind threaten me. Most excellent and mercifullest Lady, Y'ave raised me to a joy beyond my thoughts, May all the Gods require you for this goodness, And I wear out my life to do you service. Prud. My dear Horatio enough, I doubt not Thy affections equal unto mine; we will Love while we live, and may we dye forgotten When we do cease to love, say I not well? Hora. Admired Princess, you out-speak me much, But never shall out-love me. Prud. Heavens be kind, And make us in two bodyes have one mind. Exeunt. Finis Actus Primi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus scena prima. Enter Trappolin solus. Trap. This banish't life is very doleful, I walk I know not whither, and every step I go Flametta comes into my mind, I think how she cried when we parted, and swore that she would go too, and certainly so she wood, if I had not told her she was not banisht, and might not. Farwel my true Flametta; and the Divel take the two scurvy Lords Barbarino, and Machavil, for Captain Mattemoros he is a pratling asse; but by my conscience, he could nere ha turn'd me loose for such a matter. Farwel my draughts of Montefiascone and Bologna Sausages, me thinks this is a very melancholy place: I have not seen a living body these two houres, but they had wings, or four legs: let me bethink me whither to betake my self; for in Tuscany stay I must not, Ide to Rome and turn Frier if I had any Latine in me; there is nothing of Millain or Naples, without I mean to turn souldier for one dinner a day. Farwel all my good suppers I was wont to have, the wenches I helpt Gentlemen to: Venice, I that's the likeliest place of all, and there I'le follow my own trade, I love to be fingring of Mons. and Polax Ryals, well then I'le to Venice, and turn pimpe; it is a good gainful life in Italy, full of ease and pleasure, especially if the flesh be young and handsome. Methinks I hear a busling in yon trees, I hope it be not a thief; for then I shall lose the ring Brunetto gave me, and may go hang my self. Yon's an old man, an he be one I care not, for sure I shall be good enough for him. Enter Mago a Conjurer. Mago. Son, you are banisht, I know all the matter. Trap. Tis true, old friend, I am indeed; but how the Divel came you to know it? Mago. Why the Divel told me. Trap. Alas that ere I was born! I pray you father conjurer do not hurt me. Mago. Son Trappolin, I am so far from hurting thee, that thee I do intend to make a Prince. Trap. I pray you pardon me father conjurer, I have no mind to domineer or swagger in hell. Mag. You understand me not, thou shalt return to Florence. Trap. And be hang'd there for my labour. Mago. Be honoured there, and be suppos'd the Duke, Who now in Milain is about his wife. Trap. Faith if you can bring this about, father conjurer, I should laugh indeed; but suppose it could be done, when his Highness comes Woe be to my neck. Mag. No fear at all, leave all to me, and but remember what I say and thou art safe. Trap. Faith I know not what to think of this; but Conjurers can do much. Mag. I'le do it never doubt, come near to me, within this circle go, and do not fear though thou seest divels skip about thee. Trap. Father Conjurer farewel, I had rather live in banishment then see the Divel. Mago. Thou silly fellow do not fear, in this Myriades of fiends dare not, nor can they hurt thee; Here thou shalt stand as safe from any danger As ever thou didst yet in any place. Think'st thou I have so little power over spirits, As they dare disobey what I command? Tell me thy wish, and if thou hast it not, Before thy face I'le sink away with fear. Give me thy hand and come. Trap. Father conjurer, I faith I wish nothing more then what you have promised me already; could that be done I need nere be a pander agen. Mago. Why do you stay? Trap. Shall I be safe? Mago. As free from peril as you can desire. Trap. Why then I'le venter, being for such a matter; But honest father Conjurer, if for fear I chance To die, let not your divels take my body. Mago. Come, do not fear at all, there is no need. Trap. I will venter, but I pray you let not the divels come too near me. Mago. You that below frequent the Stygian lake, And in Cocytus waves do bathe yourselves, You that upon the strands of Phlegeton Do use to walk, attend unto my charmes, Appear, I charge thee to appear, thou fiend, Thou that over mans head power hast, appear Eo thou spirit come,— Trap. Good father conjurer Let not the Divels be too ugly, lest I play the sloven and annoy your nose. Mago. Fear not. Trap. Honest Master Counjurer, yonder comes your Divel, pray you circle me once more, for I'me afraid he'l be too bold with me. Mago. Not all the fiends that are in hell can do The least annoyance to thee, Trappolin: Thou art safe, and so believe thou art, come Eo Give me that hat unchanted. Eo. Here it is, Command me ought else. Mago. No, vanish now: Son Trap. observe me well, this hat Keep alwaies on thy head, 'tis Eo cald, One of the things will make thee thought a Prince. Trap. Tis none of the handsomest, mine's of a better block, I think some Naples Devil made it, tis so high crownd, one that saw me in this would rather think me a fool then a duke. Mago. Meo thou spirit of magick glass appear, I charge thee in dread Plutoes name to come; Trap. More Devils yet! is the Circle sure, Father Conjurer? and t' be not I pray you take an order with it, I have no mind at all to venter my self against the Devil. Mago. Have I not told thee thou art safe? fear not, Trap. Yonder's another Devil I think of Moran, for he brings a looking glass with him. Mago. Deliver it, be gone. Trap. I thank you for it, (besworn) for in good earnest father Conjurer I would have as little the company of your Devils as is possible. Mago. But before I give you this mirrour (Sonne) Receive this powder by Magick art compos'd, And secret spells; he upon whom thou flingest it (It hath such hidden vertue in it) will Be took by all for Trappolin. Trap. For me? Mago. Yes certainly for thee. Trap. Say you so? why then I faith with all my heart: Give it me, I swear unto you (old father) the very best man in Tuskany shall be Trappolin. Mago. Here put it up and keep it safe. Trap. And I do not hang me. Mago. Now are you ready for the looking glass? Trap. I am very ready indeed. Mago. Son Trappolin, this looking glass was wrought In the deep Caverns of the dark Abyss, Compos'd of the mud of Phlegeton, And with the blood of tortur'd Miscreants, It is a Mirrour I have studied long And now have brought unto perfection: This upon thee I do bestow, a gift Such as the Crowns of Emperours could not buy. Trap. And yet Father Conjurer, I have seen half a dozen better sold for a pistol. Mago. They were the works of mortalls: When thou hast A cloke Ile give thee two: but look in this And thou shalt see thy self the Duke; and if, When he returnes agen, thou meetest him (But throw the powder on him first) and he Begins to rage, bid him look in't, and it Will shew him the reflexion of thee. Trap. Say you so? why then give me the glass. Mago. Here, stand still, I will now raise up the fiend That hath the Cloke which I have promised thee. Trap. Father Conjurer, as you love your son Trappolin, give me another Circle or two, for I promise you I fear this almost worne out. Mago. Still thou dost fear; be bold and confident, Hell cannot hurt thee as thou standst. Trap. Why then let him come. Mago. In Proserpin's dread name our Soveraign Queen, Areto, I do charge thee to appear; Thus by the wast of this enchanted Wand I do command thee fiend unto this place. Trap. No more Father Conjurer, hold, here comes the Devil, he's a Taylor in hell sure, for he brings a cloke. Areo. Thou against whom fierce Cerberus dares not bark, Here is the Cloke, which, to obey thy will, We (that thy servants are) have made. Mago. Tis well: Be gone, I licence thy depart; this Cloke, Son Trappolin, doth perfect thee the Duke. Trap. I know not, but on my conscience the poorest of his Highness servants near wore a worse, it seems to me to have been made of these miserable thefts of a beggerly Taylor, t'is of so many Colours; and for the fashion of it (by your leave Father Conjurer) tis very clownish, and something inclining to the fools fashion. Mago. Thy words, Son Trappolin, are vain. Those Counts And Marquesses that swagger it in Gold, Shall not appear so glorious to the eyes Of men as thou in this. Trap. Father Conjurer, Ile be rul'd by you, put on. Mago. Thou art the great Duke now in shew, the wisest Judgements will believe thee so, now take the glass and see thy self in't. Trap. Beseech your Highness pardon me, I am A poor subject of yours, for a small matter Banish't by envious Lords. Mago. Why Trappolin what folly is this? Trap. Besworne to you Father I thought I saw his Highness, and was a begging to be pardoned: Mago. Away with ignorance, twas thy Reflexion, As thou didst seem unto thy self, so thou Shalt likewise to the world appear; now mark me, Not one of these can make thee like the Duke; They altogether do: nere leave them off Without thou art secure, for one but missing Thou wilt appear thy self: The Hat is cald After the Devills name that brought it, Eo, The Looking Glass Meo, the Cloke Areo, And there are fiends within them. Trap. Father Conjurer, I thank you for your kindness, take all your ware agen; carry so many Devills about me? so I shall be sure to be carried to the Devil by um. Mago. Suspect no hurt, they can as well destroy Their immortality as do thee harm. Trap. Why then (honest father Conjurer) Ile venter my self among them, but I swear unto you if they begin to stir Ile ene fling them all away without more a do. Mago. Farewell son Trappolin, return to Florence, And flourish in the pleasures of the court: Other affairs command me to be gone, Give me thy hand; farewell son Trappolin. Trap. Be not so hasty (my dear old father) one word before you go: how shall I say, that I bring not my Dutchesse with me, but come alone? Mago. Why any thing, what you will. Trap. Ile make um believe then that I licenced her to stay as long as she pleases, and that I came alone to see how they governed in my absence. Mago. 'Twill do, now have you done with me? Trap. I have: I thank you for all your things here, fare you well honest father Conjurer. Exit Mago. Trap. Now Trappolin is no more Trappolin, What I am in my glass I'le look again: The great Duke, ha! tis well, 'tis very well; This scurvy Cloak doth seem his gallant one, And this base Hat his Highness Beaver; my face, My body, leggs and all seem changed; I faith The Conjurer is a wondrous learned fellow. You scoundril Lords that banish't me, I'le make Sport with your scurvy Honors, that I will. Eo, Meo, and Areo attend Unto your offices well, and guard your friend. Scena Secunda. Enter Sforza the Duke of Milain, Hortentia the Dutchess, Isabella his sister, Lavinio the great Duke with Attendants. Sfor. Most noble brother (for so the Temple Rites Of Hymen done do licence me to call you) Honour our entertainment one half hour Longer, and we will leave you with your Bride. Lavinio. Great Prince, the glories you have done me here I leave to future Chronicles to tell, And still you do increase them; sure no man In Milain ever did receive such honours; You always shall command me. Sfor. Sir, we deserve no complements, we have Our wishes, if you but rest satisfied Of our good meaning. Lavinio. Most gracious Madam, the Roman Emperours Would have wondred at your Court had they but known it: Which of them all would not have blest his fates For the fruition of so rich a Beauty, As is the matchless Lady Isabella? Isab. Sir, of your own you may say what you please, But I am sure you over-praise me much. La. Dearest of all the world, thou dost deserve Princes and Poets both to speak thy worth. Bless'd be the powers divine, that me of all Mankind did chuse to make most fortunate, In giving me the glory of the earth. Sfor. Sit down most noble brother, from your Bride We will not part you: sister, this place is yours; So let them now begin. Enter Hymen, Luna, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Sol, after Musick. Hym. Hither we are descended from above, To gratulate your nobly grounded love; That you most worthy happy paire should know The Gods themselves are pleas'd with what you do. Me you have honoured, and to honour you, I have brought the Deities along, which do Command and rule the dayes, that they may bless You all the year with plenteous happiness. May Tuscanes Cities boast of Milains Spouse; And future Ages, when they would compose One grac'd with all the vertues, her express To be a Lady like this Milaness. And may the most ingenious Florentines, Your Citizens (Great Duke) busie their minds In writing, and in singing Marriage-songs, Delectable Epithalamiums. While you do live love ever, and may you Continually your generous hears renew. Thus Hymen wishes, and it will go hard If what a god says gods do not regard. Thus I could spend the night, but that would prove A wrong unto my Rites and to your love. Here they dance, and Hymen leads it. Luna. Cinthia I am, that with my borrowed light Out-shine the Stars, and do command the night: Many a time, when else I vail'd would ride, I will appear to see you with your Bride. Lamps nor wax lights you shall not need, for I Instead of them will ever more be by. And may you in this life you have begun, Equal in love me and Endymion. Mars. Though my aspect be fierce, and wars presage, To you they shall be such as Lovers wage, Sweet kisses, soft embraces, and such things As amorous Queens enjoy and amorous Kings. You therefore without pity both may fight Battailes, not full of danger but delight: And may they last until I part you two; Which I do promise I will never do. Mer. Hermes I am, Maja's wing'd Son, and shine Among the Planets in a Globe of mine: And though 'tis true I favour thefts and sleights, Yet will do none t' diminish your delights. Love therefore, laugh and kiss, embrace, and be Secure, nothing can hurt you without me; And if I ever do, may I forgo My Sphere, and live among the fiends below. Iupit. Of all the Gods and Goddesses I am The most supreme, and bear the chiefest name. For Love what is it that I have not done To bring my wishes to conclusion? I for my self have done no more then I Will do for you, to make you live in joy. Therefore most happy pair of Lovers, fear Nothing, since Iove himself doth hold you dear; Live merrily, and let this be your mover, That Iupiter himself was once a Lover. A Song. Venus. Since in my Orbe I shined fair, And Lovers did befriend, (The morning and the evening Star) I never could commend (Heaven blessed paire) none like to you, Whom time shall never make untrue. May Hesperus and Vesper lose Their lights, fair Venus fall; If all her power she doth not use To prosper you withal. May other Dieties grant you life, I'le make you loving man and wife. Sat. Though I am old and rigid in aspect, And cold and youthful sports do not affect; And though my influences many ways Adverse to others be, and cross their days: For you, heaven-loved pair, my self I'le force, And run a milder and a gentler course; His ancient custome Saturne will forget, Rise for your pleasures, for your pleasures set. Doubt me not therefore, for my vow is strong, That for your sakes again I wish me young. Sol. Phœbus I am, the glorious guide of day, That all the Planets lighten with my ray: I am the brightsome, lightsome Charioter That heaven and earth adorn within my Sphere; And know what 'tis to be in love since I Followed my Daphne, who from me did flie. May I lose all my glory, all my Beams Fall like my Phaeton int' Ocean streams, If all my faculties I do not try To make you live in joy, and love in joy. In Summer time when you int' Arbors go, I will not shine to trouble you below, Will onely peep to see you kiss and smile, To make me think, this I have done ere while. In Winter season when the Frost doth stay, And hinder Rivers to go on their way; When flakes of Snow do cover earths green face, I for your sakes will thaw off both apace. In pleasures evermore you shall accord; Apollo cannot falsifie his word. Here they dance another dance which Hymen leads. Hym. The gracious Planets which command the days By powerful influences, you have heard To bless you both according to their ways, Vowing to be your keepers and your guard. Them for your sakes with me I brought along, That they might prosper you as well as I, Because this marriage knot I'de tye so strong, That it there nothing ever should untie. You whom the heavens will prosper all your life, You whom on earth ther's nothing can offend, Most happy pair, most happy man and wife, Your lives in love wear out and in love end. Nor shall a Poet hired for his gain, Vpon your Tomb a feigned verse engrave; Mens tongues and tears shall make you both remain Above the power of an Epitaph. But may you live till you aweary be, Not of your selves, but of these earthly sports; And the eternal joys above would see, Which ever are in Joves immortal Courts. Thus unto you do gods their wishes give, And unto them may you according live. Exeunt Maskers. Sfor. I think, Hortentia, now the Mask is done, Our brother gladly would go to his rest. Hort. And it is time, most noble brother, when You please we will attend you to your Chamber, And sister, we will see you laid in bed; Methinks it is a very pretty thing To see a Virgin blush, look pale and blush. Isa. 'Tis sport to others, to the Maid 'tis none. La. Most excellent, Princess when you please let's go, For now each minute is as tedious to me As years have been, so much I do desire The chast embraces of my matchless Spouse. Sfor. And worthy friend, let us entreat your stay As long in Milain as is possible; You cannot be in Florence more beloved, Nor by the better nor the meaner sort. La. What I can do you know you may command Unto my utmost power. Hort. Lights. Lavi. My fairest, dearest love, your hand, this part Of happiness makes me suppose the rest. Exeunt. Scena Secunda. Enter Mattemoros. Matt. Those lazy times that do degenerate minds, And breed new thoughts in most Heroick hearts, By noble spirits are to be abhor'd, And lothed as the ruine of their souls. Whilst I did follow the Triumphant War Through fire and blood, I was a happy man; I thought no pleasure was a parallel To the loud cry of mortal wounded foes: But now I am transformed from my self, Hipolita hath charm'd me with a look; May I but hear her speak, how I rejoyce! May I but hear her sing, I think me blest. O how my heart's ashamed of my tongue, Which never until now effeminate thoughts Could win upon. O would to heaven this Lady Were but a man, and circled round with death, That I might kill her, and release my self: Or were she like the Warlike Amazon, VVith whom renowned Theseus did contend, That with my honour I might challenge her For an enchanter, and a witch. How fondly And foolishly I rave! strongest resolutions A womans powerful beauty doth destroy; He that can conjure men, unpeople towns, Cover the sea with Fleets, drink rivers dry VVith armed squadrons he conducts to fight, VVhom potent monarchs fear, and Emperors wish To make their friend, a Ladies smile, or eye Subdues above resistance, and makes die. Enter Horatio and Prudentia. Hora. Most dearest worthiest Princess, I am blest Above the proudest of my former wishes; Your love to me was like a thing desired, But far from expectation: as men Forlorn and wretched, being content to die, And sure to suffer, wish to live, although, They fully do despair of life; of late Even so was it with me, I lov'd you Above my lives expression, but did ever Despair the blessedness of such an honour. Prud. My dear Horatio, I cannot speak So well as you, but I can love as truly. Mat. A strange discovery! I will retire More close and hear the rest. Pru. And noble Sir, Because I know my brother the Great Duke Will not at all, or scarce allow this match, I will with you whensoever you command Leave Florence, and what fortune it shall please The Gods to send us, bear with cheerfulness. Hora. Excellent merciful Prudentia, I must pray Heaven make you a full requital, For I shall ever be unable. Prud. I cannot stay longer with you now, at our next meating I'le cloy you with my company. A kiss. Farewel my hearts best pleasure. Exit Prudentia. Hora. Let others travel Italy all over, To talk of such a City, such a place: Go to magnificent and holy Rome, Once the sole Empress of the conquered world; To Venice rich, commanding, politick; Unto sweet Naples, plenteous in Nobility; Unto great Milain; unto fat Bologna, Civil Ferrara, Arriostoes town, Strong-walled Padua which Antenor built, The Trojan Prince, and Titus Livius fames For his nativity and sepulchre; To subtile Burgamo, most highly honoured For neer relation to Tarquato Tasso; To proud and stately Genua renown'd By her seafaring citizen Colombo; Worthy Varona, old Catullus city; Bloody Peruggin, warlike Bessia, Glorious Mantua, Virgilius Maro's birth-place, Good Rimini, iron Pistoya, Fine languag'd Siena, and industrious Luca, Odd-humor'd Forly, honest old Ravenna, Ill-aired Simegallia, Capua Effeminate and amorous, wherein The Carthaginian Captains Souldiers were Spoil'd and debauch'd with pleasures; Pisa hanging, Pesaro a garden of best fruits, Ancona Prays'd for the Port Loyal, and true Urbino, Round Ascoli, long Recanati, built Upon a steep hills ridge, Foligno full Of sugry streets, among the Apennine, Faro for handsome women most extold, And Modena happiest of them all; From beauteous comely Florence when I part Without Prudentia, thunder strike my heart. Exit. Mat. A gallant resolution; for the man I cannot blame him, but the Princess, she To look so low, and dote upon a slave, Seems very strange, and full of wonder to me. Had Delphian Oracles, ever ador'd For uttering truth, spoke this, I should have doubted: She whom we thought a Saint, a pattern for Nunnes, Thus to forget herself, it doth amaze me. O women, I could rage against the sex! And lov'd I not Hipolita I would. She cannot hear me, and I needs must speak A word or two, they are all false and fickle all, The poyson of mens happiness, within (Though they are fair without) most full of sin. Enter Barbarino and Machavil. Barb. Good morrow Captain Mattemoros. Mac. How do you Captain? Mat. Your Honours humble slave, I am well, but sad; And so had all the Court good cause to be, Did they but know so much as I. Bar. Why Captain, What's the matter? Mat. I'le not be silent for her Honours sake; Prudentia the Princess is in Love, With whom do you suppose my Lords? Mac. I think with none, for we all know, she yet Hath slighted Modena's and Parma's Duke, And seem'd careless of mankind. Mat. Alas! She were most happy were it one of them: It is Brunetto she's in love withall. Barb. How? Mac. Impossible! Mat. It is a thing most true, my eies and eares Have seen and heard it, while I stood unseen. Mac. You amaze us. Barb. It is a thing I never should have thought, Though spent my life in fond imaginations. Mat. As I have seen an amorous cloud receive A stately hil into her lovely breast, And of his lofty head our eyes bereave, And seem to lull his sences unto rest: So did the scorneful Lady daign to leave All her majestick state, and sore opprest With inward flames, her eager armes she cast About his neck, kist and embrac't him fast. Bar. Wonders. Mac. How the Great Duke will rage? Mat. And do you not my Lords in time prevent them, They'l steal away I fear, for so she vow'd, When he but said the word she wood. Mac. By his imprisonment we'l hinder that. Enter Horatio. Barb. Here is the man we spake of. Mac. For the Princes honour let us keep it close As possible we can. You of the guard. Enter the guard. Barb. Seise on Brunetto, carry him to prison, Bid Puchannello keep him safe, Tis our pleasures. Hora. What violence is this? O had I been suffered to wear a sword, some of you should pay dearly for it! Mac. Away with him. Exeunt the guard with Horatio. Mat. My Lords, you have done wisely to prevent So great a dishonour as might have ensu'd Tainted the family of the Medices, And been a lasting sorrow to the Duke. Enter Trappolin. Barb. His Highness is returned. Mach. Great Sir, upon our knees we welcome you; You come unlookt for, we did not expect This happy time so soon by fourteen dayes. Where is our Dutchess? Trap. Your Dutchess will not come till the Gods know when, for I do not, I have gin her leave to stay as long as she will, but besworne I fear you have governed but scurvily in my absence, I hear that you have banisht an honest poor man cal'd Trappolin, is it true? Mach. So please your Highness he deserv'd no less. Trap. Why what hurt had he done, had he knockt any body oth the head? What was his fault? Bar. He was a pander, and corrupted youth. Trap. You lie Sirra, not panders but whores do that, and not they neither if they be sound: banish one of my subjects for such a matter? besides were there no more in Florence but he? Mac. Be not displeased we humbly pray your Highness, For we did think we did it for the best. Mat. I wonder at our Duke in this. Trap. Well, I am very weary, I left all my train behind with my wife, and rid as fast as I could drive that I might come unlookt for the better to see how you behav'd your selves, which you have done bad enough. When I was almost at Florence a saucy Varlet rob'd me and stole my horse from me, so that I was beholding to my leggs to bring me hihither. Barberino and Machavil come you hither both of you. Mach. What is your Highness pleasure? Trap. Sirra Barberino hold by Mach's breeches, and stoop, for on thy back I will ride to my Palace. Barb. Ile go fetch a Coach for your Highness. Trap. The Devil take your Coaches, stoop I say without more ado: where is your obedience? Matte. I think the Duke's run mad, or foxt soundly at the least I know not what to think of this. Trap. You Sirra Don, run by my side, supply my Lackeys office, wonder not but obey. Mach. There is no remedy: heaven be merciful, I think his Highness run mad for fear when he was robd. Trap. Now on and do not loyter: Thus like the Roman Emperours will I ride To triumph through Florence; stumble not you had best, Chariots them carried, a Tuscan Noble me; mine is the statelier and the braver way; Eo, Meo and Areo thanks. Matte. He jeers us and miscalls us. Trap. On apace, That I may quickly be in my Palace. Exeunt Omnes. Finis Actus Secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius Scena prima. Enter Horatio in prison. Hora. Unto the man enthral'd black and obscure Is the clear beauty of the brightest day; Through Iron Grates he only sees the light, And thereby doth increase his misery; Those whom he doth perceive in joy to pass Augment his wretchedness, by making him To think that thus I lately was my self: But admirablest Lady of the world, Divine Prudentia, may I die abhor'd By all mankind, if I repine at all, Seeing for thy sake I do suffer this; The exquisitest tortures curious inventions make, For thee I would think sports, and undergo; Mayst thou live happily and free from care, And all my miseries of no moment are. Enter Trappolin. Trap. Eo, Meo and Areo, faith you are all brave Devils all on you, and my father Conjurer an excellent fellow; I love to see my self, Meo thou art not the work of Moran; No, the Duke himself I seem. I now must learn to walk in state, and speak proudly, Ile play such tricks with my Lord banishers, shall make me sport enough: banish a poor man for doing courtesies! it is against the law of friendship, I am suppos'd a Prince, the Florentines acknowledge me the great Duke; what ever I do tho never so bad passeth with approbation: poor Trappolin turn'd Duke! tis very strange, but very true; Would the fates favour panders in this wise, He were a fool besworn would not turne pimp, Seeing Pandors Dukes become, he is an asse That may hav't will let the office pass. O me Brunetto, alas for thee man! how camst thou there? I think in my heart an there be a mischief in the world thou wilt be at one end or other on't, So ho Pucchanello, Pucchanello! Puch. Who calls: Enter Pucchanello. Trap. That do I Sirra, let me Brunetto out presently, and bid him come to me. Pucch. Your Highness pleasure shall be done. Ex. Trap. Alas poor Brunetto! marl what he has done to be lockt in such a place, I think in my conscience tis not for any Lechery, for I could never get him to't, and many a time I have offered him many a good bit: Brunetto to come into the Jayle! I cannot tell what to think of it, but be't for what it will out he goes; my good friend Brunetto who gave me a Ring shall not lie there; Honest Brunetto. Enter Brunetto Hora. Great Prince: Trap. He makes a very low leg, but I will not be out-gone in courtesie; Dearest Brunetto. Hora. Your Highness doth forget your self exceedingly, I am your prisoner. Trap. My best friend good Brunetto. Hora. Beseech your Highness to remember you self. Trap. So I do, but never must forget thee, I am glad to see thee in good health, dear Brunetto. Hora. I shall fall to the ground even now in this salutation; beseech your Highness, I am your prisoner, your slave. Trap. I am thy servant Brunento. Hora. Wonders! I am astonished; upon my humble knees I do congratulate your safe and speedy return. Trap. And upon my knees I do embrace thee Brunetto, thou art an honest man, my most sweet Brunetto. Hora. I know not what to think, nor what to speak; Beseech your Highness rise. Trap. Not without thee, up Brunetto, honest Brunetto up I say. Hora. Beseech your Highness, I am your humble slave. Trap. I am thy servant Brunetto, and as long as thou liest on the ground so will I too; up therefore, let us rise and talk, away with your complements; I cannot abide them, up I say, lets rise; thou shalt not stay I swear. Hora. I am amazed, by force I must obey: Great Sir, I know not what to think, you honour me above all expression. Trap. Honour a fig, I love thee Brunetto, thou art a good honest fellow, I love thee with all my heart: Complement with me, and I will be very angry; without more ado I tell thee I love thee. Puchanello so ho! Sirra Puchanello, bring two chairs hither presently. Hora. Your Highness. Trap. Away with Highness, I say away with it, call me Lavin Duke, plain Medices, I cannot abide your Highness, your Excellency, your Worship. I hate such idle flimflams, dear Brunetto, how I love thee, I faith I do with al my heart, and if I lie unto thee I would I might be hang'd. Hora. Sure I am awake, this is no dream. Trap. We will live merrily together, I faith we will Brunetto, how glad I am to see thee in health! come Sirra, what a while ha you been a bringing a couple of chairs! set them here Sirra and be gone. Exit Pucchanello. Brunetto, sit thee down, sit down man I say. Hora. I will attend your Highness on my knees. Trap. Why I am not thy Father, am I? leave fooling and sit thee down, that we may talk together, sit thee here I will have it so, Hora. I am astonisht, I humbly pray your Highness. Trap. Pray me no praying, but sit thee down, sit thee here man. Brunetto be rul'd. Hora. On the right hand, I know not what to think. Trap. I am something aweary Brunetto, and will not not sit without thee, therefore I pray thee make me stand no longer; obey, me for I am the Duke. Mora. Here then so please your Highness. Trap. Why an thou wilt have it there, there let it be, but I am mistook thats on the left hand, what do you think me a clown and without breeding, that I ha no more manners in me? for shame of the world, sit thee down Brunetto, sit thee down &amp; without more bidding, without thou wilt ha me lie on the ground, for I am so weary I can scant stand. Hora. There is no remedy, I must obey. Trap. So, well done, sit still man, what art doing, art afraid of me? Hor. What does your Highness mean? Trap. Marry and thou drawst back Ile draw back too; Brunetto sit thee still and let us talk. Hora. I will obey your Highness. Trap. Highness me no more highness, I cannot abide it, my name is Lavin, call me Lavin Duke, and tis enough a conscience. Hora. Great Sir, I am far unworthy of these honors, The noblest Florentines would be most proud To be thus graced by their Prince. Trap. I like not these set speeches neither, let us talk as we were companions in a Tavern together, and not after the Court fashion, I am as weary of it as a Dog, I am Brunetto; prithee man how cam'st thou into the Gaol? Hora. O pardon me Dread Soveraign. Trap. On thy knees man? what meanest thou by this, dost take me for Mahomet? as well as I can pardon thee I do, any thing what ere it be, though thou hast kil'd every body; rise therefore I say Brunetto, and set thee in thy place again or Ile kneel too. Hora. Most merciful Prince, hear me before, lest you Repent your kindness towards me afterward. Trap. Up I say Brunetto, up, I pardon thee any thing, upon condition thou wilt rise and sit thee down. Hora. It is your Highness will. Trap. Now good Brunetto without any fear (for I swear unto thee I do not care what thou hast done, and forgive thee whatsoever it be) tell me the cause. Hora. Dread Soveraign, I was for love put in. Trap. Who put thee in? Hora. Your Highness Governors, Lord Barberino, and Lord Machavil. Trap. They are a couple of Coxcombs for their pains; who art in love withal? Hora. O pardon me. Trap. Sit still or I will not, and if thou dost I will. Hora. Your Highness Excellent sister—O great Prince! Trap. Sit still Brunetto, wast thou laid up for that? Alas for thee, hast thou married her? Hora. So please you Highness no. Trap. It doth neither please my Highness nor Lowness neither, I wo'd thou hadst, and that's all the hurt I wish thee: couldst thou think I that loved thee so would be angry with thee for this, hast thou her consent? Hora. I have. Trap. I am very glad of it, and I here give thee mine too: prethee Brunetto do me the favour to go and bid Barberino or Machavil come to me, I'le send for my sister presently, and if she says so to me, I'le soon have you married. Hora. You Highness shall command me to my death, More willingly unto my life, for so This business doth importt; he heavens be praised, And ever be propitious to you, bless you According to your own and my desires. Exit. Trap. This Brunetto is a good honest fellow, and hath always behaved himself very well, and whatsoever he be I'le give him Prudentia for the Ring he gave me, I will not be ungrateful; he said he was in love with my sister, and if he had them all, I wo'd een say much good do his heart with them: but he means the Princess, and though I have little to do with her, yet if I can give her him I will. Brunetto's Ring I shall never forget. Enter Machavil. Mac. Your Highness pleasure. Trap. My Highness pleasure, Sirra Lord, is, that you go and tell my sister Prudentia I would speak with her presently, I will expect her here: be gone. Exit. The Dukes life is very pleasant, I take great content in it, and were it not for one thing I were most happy, which is, I dare not disclose my self to my dear Flametta, for she is a woman, and full of title tatle as the rest are; nor if I could win her without making my self known, durst I lye with her, by reason of putting off Eo, Meo, and Areo, otherwise sure I should get her; for sure she would not refuse a Duke. Enter Flametta. Flametta. Here is the Duke alone, whom I so long Have sought for to petition for the repeal Of my dear Trappolin. Great Prince, as low As truest humility can make a Suitor; Before you I prostrate my self; Most excellent And merciful Sir, pitty a loving Maid, Who is bereaved of her joys; I beg Poor banish't Trappolin might be recalled, Whom (when your Highness was to Milain gone,) Was by those cruel Lords whom you did leave Our Governors, sent into banishment. Great Duke, you that have noble thoughts, and sure A heart full of commiseration, Kill me not with a cruel hard denial. Trap. Ah Eo, Meo, and Areo, hinder me! I must counterfeit with her; fair Maiden rise. Flam. O let me kneel (Great Sir) until you say My Trappolin shall be repeal'd. Trap. Rife I say, &amp; we will talk of it; I cannot abide to see any body kneel unless they are in the Church, that have leggs to stand on: how may I call you Maiden? Flam. So please your Highness, my name is Flametta. Trap. Mris. Flametta, I say give me your hand, rise without more ado, rise without you mean to say your Beads over; Mris. Flametta be rul'd, good Mris. Flametta be rul'd, wo'd I were hanged if ever Trappoline come home and you get not up; up I say therefore. Flam. I must be most rude. Trap. Why that's well done Mris. Flametta: Trappolin for whom you are a petitioner, young Mistris, is banish't you say, for what it matters not, tell me what you'l give for his repeal. Flam. Even any thing I have, all that I have. Trap. Are you a Virgin? tell me true, if you are not, it is no wonder besworn, it is more wonder by the half if you are, for I think there be not two of your age in the City that be. Flam. May I not prosper in my wishes Sir, If I be not a Maid. Trap. And will you give your Maidenhead to have him recal'd from banishment? Flam. To him when he comes home, and we are married. Trap. Well said Mistress, But tell me now what will you give me for to have him come home?— Flam. Even any thing I have. Trap. I am a great man, and like them, will not do favours for nothing; will you give me your Shoos? Flam. My Shoos! your Highness jests. Trap. I swear unto you (Mistriss) but I do not, and if you do not give me what I ask (how ridiculous soever it seems to you) Trappolin nere comes in Florence again. Flam. I wonder at the Duke, but will obey him; Here are my shooes dear Prince. Trap. Well done I say, but I must have your Stockings too off with them therefore without any more arguing. Flam. My Stockings with all my heart to have my Trappolin. Trap. Very well done Mrs Flam. you do very well, give me your gown too; Do not wonder, these will do nothing without it. Flam. Then shall your Highness have it. Trap. I see you love that fellow well, 'tis well done of you, I think he be an honest man, which makes me the willinger to yield to his repeal; I say I must have that Petticote too, else all this is not worth a rush i'faith. Flam. I think the Duke's mad—And will you give me then your Highness word? Trap. I will. Flam. I cannot help it, here it is. Trap. I swear unto thee, young Wench, give me thy under Petticote and thy Smock, and I will give thee my word, and send for him presently to night this Wench makes me curse Eo, Meo, and Areo. Flam. Most excellent Sir, there is not in the world The thing that in my power lies I wo'd Deny to do for my dear Trappolin, But modesty forbids me to do this. Trap. I shall not have them then? Flam. I beseech your Highness pardon me. Trap. I am very sorry I could not see her naked, but it cannot be help't; well how many kisses will you give me my young Mistriss? Flam. Kisses? Most Gracious Prince, a thousand and a thousand times. I'le kiss your hand upon my humble knees. Trap. I have no pleasure in that: how many kisses upon lips will you give me? Flam. For Trappolins sake, I'le do any thing that modesty will give me leave; do what you please Sir. Trap. Ah honey sweet Flametta, how I love thee, prithee kiss better: dear lips! I could almost wish Eo, Meo, and Areo i'th' fire; again, again, again, sweet Flametta. Flam. Shall Trappolin come home? Trap. Do but let us kiss, and thou shalt have any thing. O me! what a misery 'tis to be a great man? again, again Flametta, Trappolin shall come home. Flam. I am aweary. Trap. So shall I never be; again, again. Enter Prudentia. Flam. The Princess, your Highness sister: You have gin your word. Trap. Young Mistress, I have not leisure to answer you now, come to me some other time, and I'le talk with you further: now take up your things and be gone. Flam. I am assur'd I shall prevail: heavens guard your Highness. Exit. Prud. Now I expect my brothers rage, for sure Though nere so secret kept) my Love unto My dearest Horatio by some uncouth means Unknown: say what he will, or can, I am Resolv'd, and my affection's setled. Trap. Fair Lady, come hither, you are my sister, are you? Prud. I am your sister and servant Sir. Trap. Complement with me no more then I complement with you; good Madam sister sit you down, I would talk with you a little. Prud. He talkes as though he were distracted. I obey you Sir. Trap. Tis well done, good Lady sister. Prud. I never saw my brother thus before; Sir, I am exceeding glad to see you Return'd in safety out of Lombardy; but should have been more joyful had you brought your Dutchess with you. Trap. She'l come soon enough nere fear't; but sister, I must be something brief, for I am a hungry; as soon as I came home, I saw Brunetto in the Gaol, who after many circumstances and fears, told me 'twas for love of you that he was put there; tell me sister Prudentia, do you love him? I'le besworn the man is a good honest fellow, if you have a mind to him I'le give you my consent with al my heart: I vow as I am an honest man, and the Duke, I do not jest. Prud. Most worthy brother, thanks; I do confess I love Brunetto, and were very guilty Of cruelty if I did not; for he Loves me I know as his own happiness: Nor, Sir, have I plac'd my affections Unworthy; Brunetto is a Prince, His name is Horatio, and he's second son Unto the Duke of Savoy; for my sake He chang'd his name and lives a prisoner. Trap. How's this! is Brunetto a Prince? you love him Lady sister you say. Prud. Most truely Sir I do. Trap. Are you content to marry him? Pru. I do desire no greater bliss on earth, So that your Highness will consent thereto. Trap. Lady sister, here is my hand, I am content i'faith, without more words I am. I am an hungry now, and would be brief, sister mine I say marry him when you will, beshrew my heart and I be not content; I had rather you had him then any man in the world. Prud. I know not what to think, he's strangely chang'd. Trap. Let this suffice Madam sister; I am very hungry I say, have you any good store of meat in the house? I could eat soundly now sister of a dish of Sausages: come Lady sister, lets to dinner, be gone, I have a good stomach as I am an honest man. Exeunt. Scena secunda. Enter Mattemoros. Mat. I that have led a life until of late In spite of death, pass'd through the dangers of it Dreadless without regard; whom never men Conducted by brave Captains to the field, Did yet withstand, am won and vanquished: Hipolita, heroick Amazon, In Love hath conquered me with amorous smiles; Methinks it is a thing most full of wonder, That what not massie pikes, nor murtherous guns Could ever do, a Ladies smiling eyes, The beauty of a timorous woman should; Her eyes have darted fire into my breast, Which nothing but her kindness can extinguish; And be she cruel I shall soon be ashes. Do I thus yield? shall I forget the sound Of martial Drums, the warlike noise of Trumpets, To list to the lascivious harmony Of instruments touched by Hipolita's hand? Shall I forget the ordering of a Camp, To ride great horses, to besiege a city, To undermine a Castle, to raise Bulwarks, All for the love of a fair fearful woman? It must be so; these legs that wont to lead Arm'd men to battel, I must use in dances: This hair that us'd to be covered with a helm, Cloggy with sweat and blood, I now must powder: These hands that wont to wave a dreadful sword, Instead of iron gauntlets now must wear Perfum'd gloves: I that had wont to be Under the Chirurgions hands to cure my wounds, Must have a barber now to keep me neat: O Love! thou art divine, and canst transform A man from what he was: it is in vain To think to shun the thing thou dost constrain. Enter Hipolita. 1. Tis idleness that is the cause We lose our liberties; The busie Cupid never drawes To yield unto his vice. 2. Away with love, it is a thing I hope I nere shall know; When many weep so I shall sing, Have joy while they have woe. 3. The happiness of love is poor, Compar'd to liberty; Blest lovers do hard things endure, Their pleasures to enjoy. 4. May I live ever as I do Free from that foolish pain; I wish that no man may me woo, Until I love again. Mat. O Heavens, is thus her mind compos'd! if I Can win this Lady, it will be a conquest Deserves a Trophie far above my best Of Victories, I will go trie her: hail Glory of Italy, compar'd to whom The fam'd Egyptian Queen would yield, sweet Lady, Most excellent Hipolita vouchsafe To hear me tell your conquest and my foile; Whom the Great Dukes greatest foes could never vanquish, Your powerful beauty hath; know Mattemoros, (Whose valour Spain not only doth report, But Mantoa hath prov'd your matchless eyes Transcendents of the brightest lightest stars) Have wounded fatally unto the heart, Unless you prove as kind as you are fair. Hip. Do you jest with me Captain? Mat. My hearts delight, sweet centre of my thoughts, I vow by your rich beauty, if my heart Could speak, it would agree full with my tongue, I would tell my love more then I can express. Hip. What ill fortune, good Seignior, you have had, To fall in Love with one deserves it not, Nor doth not care for you? and I do hope I nere shall bear affection unto man. Mat. Patience assist me mightily; not all The murtherous canon bullets I have heard Fly buzzing by my ears, nor dismal cries Of dying souldiers, nor the horrid noise Of rough tempestuous seas have ever mov'd me, Onely your harsh unkind reply hath struck Unto my very soul. Hip. I cannot help it; Had you now, Captain been abroad it'h field, This nere had happened to you; and to cure you The field will be the best; go to the wars, Busie your self in fights, and you will soon Forget you ever saw Hipolita. Mat. Most cruel fair one, be assur'd that ere I would forget you (which I know's a thing For me impossible to do) I would Into oblivion cast my best of pleasures, Even all my pleasures, I would forget to use My sword, and all the Militarie science; Witness triumphant Son of Iove, Great Mars, I vow by all the Honours of a souldier I love thee dear as mine own heart, but this Admirable Lady much above it: Nor do I displease thee in't, I know that thou Preferd'st the embraces of the Cyprian Queen Above the glorious battels of the field. Therefore (dear Lady) be most confident While I have memory, above all things, Your beauty will be fixed in't. Hip. Good Seignior, Trouble me not to answer you agen; Let this suffice, I wish you lik'd me not, Because I neither would have you nor any To love a woman will not return affection. Mat. O Heavens! Will you continue thus obdurate ever? Hip. Alwaies believe it Captain. Mat. I have not patience to contain my self; An angry cloud full fraught with thunder bolts Work't by the Cyclops on Campagnia's Stithy, Now hanging ore my head, menacing death, Presaging speedy sad destruction, Could not compel my silence, 'tis decreed By my adverse malignant stars that I Shall die destroy'd by a fair cruel woman; Which ere I do, I will a little ease My troubled heart of woe: heare merciless woman: (Whom I do curse because I love so dearly) Hear me, and afterwards go glory that Your wondrous beauty, and your savage heart Hath made a man distracted, kild a souldier. Hip. A Captain and be thus mov'd by a womans refusal! Mat. Sweetest Hipolita, be merciful, and save His life that honours you above the world. Hip. Pray you Seignior be answered. Mat. You are resolv'd then to ruine me: Curs'd be those battels all that I have fought And conquer'd in, t'had been more honour for me To have been slain by my incensed foes Which were brave souldiers, then to die in peace By the unkindness of a proud fair woman. Hip. Beseech you leave your rage, and leave me Captain. Mat. More cruel then Hyrcanian Tigers, hear Me take my leave before I go. Hip. Proceed. Mat. Thou God of love, and if thou art a God Revenge thy self and thy wrong'd deity On this unmerciful Lady; make her fall In love with the basest of all mankind, A man so full of ignorance, that he In shape alone may differ from a beast, Not know that she is fair and slight her beauty; And he himself the most deformed thing That ever burthened our mother earth With his unworthy steps: Cupid attend, And yield unto my just request; make this Lady run mad for such a monster, shed A thousand thousand tears upon her knees, While he stands laughing at her: may you die Raging for love, Hipolita as I. Hip. I do begin to pity him; sure I never Shall have a man to love me better, and though I once intended alwaies to live single, His words have altered my resolution: Nor, if I take him, shall I do a thing Will misbecome me, for he is a man High in the Great Dukes favour. Noble Captain, It is your happy fate to conquer alwaies; I vow unto you by my honour, I think Most seriously, no man upon the earth Besides you could have won; I'me the last Of all your victories, Theseus like you have Overcome Hipolita. Mat. And will you love me then? Hip. I do and alwaies will. Mat. Blest be the stars that shin'd at my nativity, I want words to express my joyes; but dearest Lady, My sweet Hipolita, my forward actions Shall make you know my heart above my tongue; I am a souldier, and was never wont To speak amorously. Hip. You have said enough. Mat. Love is but thought by words, by deeds tis known; Shew me you love me, and let words alone. Mat. Worthiest of Ladies, when I cease to do All that I can, then may your love cease too. Exeunt. Finis actus Tertii.</field>

And now Sir, Know worthy Prince we are your loyal subjects, And what we say is for your honour. Trap. If it be for my honour Ile hear you, But be as brief as you will. Mac. Your Highness hath lately released Branetto. Trap. Tis a thing very certain. Mac. We doubt not but done out of clemency, Not knowing why he lay there. Trap. Well, why was he put there? Mac. Even for your Honour sake (most Gracious Sir) The Lady Prudentia your sister loves him. Trap. Say you so? So ho Puchanello, So ho! Puch. Who calls? (Within.) Bar. His Highness; come hither presently. Trap. Bid the guard enter. Enter Puchanello and the Guard. You say Brunetto was put in prison because my sister lov'd him, you think it good and fitting he were there again. Bar. So please your Highness, yes. Trap. Puchanello take me these two Coxcombly Lords into your Custody; they are never well but when they are banishing some body, or doing some mischief or other: Brunetto was laid in prison because my sister lov'd him, and lay me these there because I love them. Mac. Beseech your Highness not to deal so hardly With us whom you have known so faithful to you. Trap. Puchanello, away with them I say: you of the Guard see them in. Bar. Most worthy Prince be merciful, if we Have done amiss twas out of ignorance. Trap. Sirra rogue away with them, or Ile lay up you too. Puch. Your Honours must have patience and walk. Mach. There is no remedy. Bar. The heavens be merciful to Florence; VVhat ill malignant starre hath so depriv'd Our wise and noble Duke of all his reason, That he remembers not who are his friends? Ex. Hor. The Gods be ever most propitious; Great Sir, unto you, and continue long Your life, chief honour of the Medices. Trap. Prince Horatio I am your servant, I pray you forgive me my calling of you by your nick-name of Brunetto; my sister hath told me you are the Son of the Duke of Savoy, besworn unto you I am very sorry I have not used you as befitted you, but it was your fault that told me not who you were: I have talked with Prudentia, and she loves you she saies, which I am glad on, and Ile marry you as soon as you will. Her. Sir, it is true I am Horatio, Son of the Piemond Prince; but being his second, I durst not think me worthy of such honours As your Highness hath done me; and therefore told None but your beauteous sister who I was. Trap. Enough my friend; and Prince Horatio, Could you suppose I would deny my sister, Though she were made of Gold and precious stones, Unto your Highness, and to such a friend? You do deserve a better wife then she; She's not half good enough for you, and if I had another sister, you should have them both. My friend a Prince! I'm very glad i' faith, But sorry that I did not know you such, That I might have done you right: wood I were hang'd If you are not far a better man then I. Hora. Great Prince, you do forget your self. Trap. Your Highness must pardon me, I do remember my self well enough, yet Eo, Meo, aad Areo, have made me something proudish, but howsoever I am your servant, Prince Horat. i' faith I am your very dutiful servant: how sa you now, the Duke of Savoyes son! i' faith I am your poor servant Lavin the Duke of Florence. Hora. I am amaz'd; he's mad: Beseech your Highness leave, I pray you Sir. Enter Mattemoros the Spanish Captain with petitioners. Trap. What have we here now, do's the Captain bring us Morris-dancers? what lobs are these tro? Mat. So please your Highness, being importun'd much these I have brought before you, that you might, do justice. Trap. Captain Mattemoros, justice I'le do with all my heart, but execution let do who will for me. Calfshead. Great Duke of Tuscany, vouchsafe to hear me, For what I speak is out of conscience; This fellow Mr. Bulflesh a Butcher, I saw Verily with mine own eyes even yesternight (When he was drunk) to kill my man, which he Swore was good Beef, and he would sell it dear. Bulf. Sirra Puritan you are a base scoundrel, was not I drunk in your company to make you merry? Calfes. But Mr. Bulflesh, you do know, and that full well, that I praied you on my knees for your own souls sake to drink no more, and profess'd to you that it was a great abominable sin in you to fox your self, or be foxed. Bulflesh. Goodman Calfeshead, you are a base scurvie Companion; do you not know that for your sake I killed your man, (yet I meant but only to beat him soundly) because he pour'd not the wine into your Codpiece? did not I do it out of friendship unto you? did I not you puritan you, and you to complain? O the ingratitude of Puritans! Trap. Peace both of you. Master Puritan hold your tongue I say: wil not Calfeshead be drunk Bulflesh? Bulf. So please your Highness no, he will let a man sooner hang him then make him drunk; Besides, he is a fellow of strange opinions, and hath sent his sonne to Geneva, to hear Iack Calvin preach. He stole a Surpless to make his Amorosa a Smock of; and hath writ a paultry Book against the Bishops, printed at Amsterdam in Decimo sexto. He will lie and steal without comparison; is both for Boyes as well as Queans when he hath mony: And like a true Italian Hypocrite, is for any sin or mischief but our Drinking. Trap. Then know I very well how to do justice: Mr. Calfeshead, you say the Butcher kild your man when he was fox't, be you fox't when you will and then kill him for't. Calf. Heavens defend, I nere was drunk yet, and never will be. Hora. There is mad justice; he doth increase my wonder. Calfs. Bless me, murther! I would not do it for the world. Mat. This is strange justice, the Butcher doth very wel deserve to be sent into the Gallies at Ligorn. Trap. I have done with you Mr. Puritan, you may be gone to the Tavern; and Bulflesh you may get you to the Shambles as soon as you will, for I have no more to say to either of you. Exeunt Calfsheead &amp; Bulflesh. I am ready for the next; speak therefore. Barne. Most excellent Prince, pity a childless father; As yesterday my only Sonne did walk Under an house, this fellow Gaffer Tiler, Who was a working on it, did fall down Upon my son, and kil'd him with his fall. Tiler. Mr. Barne be not so eager, you know I bore your son no malice, and that it was a hundred to one I broke not my own neck. Trap. This is an easie matter to conclude; Friend Barn, you say this Gafter Tiler Fell off a house, and so did kill your son; I will be very upright in my justice, Go you upon the house from whence he tumbled, (And he shall stand beneath) and fall on him. Mat. And the Duke be not stark mad, I am to think him so. Barn. So I may break my own neck. Hor. He strangely is distracted. Trap. Neighbour Barn, get you about your business, for I have done with you. Barn. I must have patience. Exeunt Barn and Tiler. Trap. Now let me make an end with these, and I have done. Mrs. Fine. Daign, Noble Duke, to hear my just complaint, I am a poor and an unfortunate widow; This man Dick Whip, as the other day he drove His coach, run over a little child of mine That was playing in the street, and kild it. Trap. Sirra Whip, is this true? Whip. So please your Highness I confess it is. Trap. It doth not please me, nor displease me, for I neither did it, nor was the child mine. Whip. It was against my will, a thing of chance, Mrs. Fine cannot deny it. Trap. Mrs. Fine, you are a widow you say? Mrs. Fine. A poor unhappy one I am. Trap. You say that Whip the coachman hath kil'd your child; and how he did it I have understood. This is my justice, I will do you right; Whip shall lie with you untill he get you another. Mat. Madder and madder. Hora. I cannot choose but smile. Whip. Most willingly, so please your Highness I am well content to do her that satisfaction. Mrs. Fine. You shall be hang'd first, that you shall, is thus my expectation fail'd? Trap. Mrs. Fine be rul'd, I will have justice done, Whip shall lie with you; you may marry him and you will: he kil'd your child, and he shall get you another, I say but right, and Sirra Whip look unto't, and you play the bungler and fail, you shall to Ligorn and learn to row: Mrs. Fine be contented, and you do not like him you might have held your tongue, for I know no body that sent for you, and so get you both gone. Whip. The Heavens preserve your Highness. Exeunt. Trap. My friend and Prince Horatio, go unto My sister, bid her to prepare her self, I'le have you married within this day or two; I long to see you both in bed together. Hora. Most willingly I will do such a message, The Gods preserve you happily. Exit. Mat. A strange discovery if true. Trap. Seignior Captain, I say I have done very good justice, and in a little time too, I am not like your scarlet coats that will do nothing without mony; a company of fellows they are whose beards and hearts agree not together. Mat. Your Highness doth dispatch things very soon. Trap. Though I am the Duke yet I love to do no hurt, as other men in authority would, I hate to banish men as Machavil and Barb. ha done: alas poor Trappolin, I hear they have banisht an honest poor man cald Trap. what the Divel Seignior Mat. came in their heads to send a poor fellow away out of his country without any money? though men may sometimes gather a reasonable Sallet abroad, he shall get no oyle to eat it withall. Mat. Great Duke of Tuscany, our noble Master, That Trap. of whom your Highness speaks, Had little fault in him, (good faith) at all Saving he was a most notorious coward. Trap. Why you Don of guns or pikes, do you think every mans mind is given to the wars? Trap. was addicted to the peace, a poor fellow full of courtesies; one that will never deny to do a favour for a friend: I will have a little sport with my Don of the wars; O me, Sir Captain, look yonder: Eo, Meo and Areo, I will put you off for a while, I will try some conclusions. Mat. Your Highness! wher's the Duke gon I marle; What Trappolin, art thou come again? Faith many a wench in Florence will be glad; Follow thy old trade, be a Pander still. Trap. Seignior Captain I am your humble slave, and if I can do you any kindness at any time, i'faith Don Mathemores you shall command me—and if you have but a mind to any Beauty in Florence, pay but me well for my pains, and her well for hers, and I will not fail you; and Captain I can give you a delicate poyson to dispatch any enemy with whom you dare not fight. Mat. I see thou art resolv'd to be a rogue, Tis pity that his Highness did repeal thee; Next time I see him, sirra Pimp, I will Make suit to have you sent into Ligorn. Trap. You Spanish coxcomb, go hang your self, do your worst. Mat. Wer't thou a souldier I wood fight with thee, Being a rogue thou dost deserve my foot; Take this you rascal. Trap. I will presently be out of his debt—who's yonder? it is the Duke or I am deceiv'd; Eo, Meo, and Areo, on agen, my hat, my glass, and cloke, sit close: how now sirra Captain, where are your manners? what do you think of me, who am I tro? I am not your Lieutenant am I? stoop and take up your hat, and let me see if it will not become your hand as well as your head in my presence. Mat. I did not see your Highness. Trap. Will you lie too? take that and learn to speak truth. Kicks him. Mat. Most Noble Prince, and my most royal Master, Pardon the error which unwillingly I have committed; in Tuscany there lives not A man that freelier for your sake would lose His life then I. Trap. Well, get you gone, I do Forgive you; but my Don at armes, remember The Duk's to be observ'd, he is the man That doth maintain you. Mat. And most worthy Prince, Did but occasion shew it self, I would Venture and lose my life to do you service. Exit. Trap. And my Father Conjurer would come into Florence, I would make him the next man unto my Highness; he is a good man, and it is great pity that he should go to the Divel, as they say Conjurers and Witches do: well, I am a brave fellow, I love to see my self in my glass, I am the Duke 'ifaith, the very Duke, I see me. Enter Flametta. Flam. I will go and petition him agen. Trap. My rogue Flametta, I could kiss her to pieces, bite off her lips, and suck out her eyes I love her so well. Flam. The great Duke of Tuskany the gracious heavens Prosper your Highness ever, I am the same That lately did intreat for the repeal Of my Beloved sweetheart Trappolin: Most excellent Sir, pity my earnest suit, And let me have my Trappolin recal'd. Trap. This is a very precious villain, how she loves me! and I ever marry while I am a Duke by Eo, Meo and Areo's leave I will have her,—your name little maid, is Flametta, as I remember? Flam. So please your Highness, yes. Trap. You sue to have banisht Trappolin come home? Flam. Most humbly, most excellent Sir, I do. Trap. Well 'tis all as please Eo, Meo and Areo, I can do nothing without them, and (my young Mistress) as long as they are in authority, I can do little for you. Flam. Then by your Highness leave, do I wish Eo, Meo, and Areo in the fire. Trap. Methinks they should be enough in that already, for the Divel made them all; now I think well on't, sometime when I have good opportunity I will off with my things and have a little sport with her: since, fair Maid, you are so earnest for your sweetheart Trappolin, he shall come home very shortly, he shall believe me, but upon condition I will do it. Flam. On any condition except my honour Sir. Trap. That he shall lie with you. Flam. Were we but married, most willingly. Trap. If he gives you his oath to have you, will not that suffice? Flam. I had rather we had married before. Trap. You need not fear, should he swear unto you and break his oath, I would hang him, and yet (though I nere mean to break my word with her) I faith I should very hardly hang my self for any thing; the rope is a very dismal thing. Flam. Shall he come home, say the word Noble Prince. Trap. Well on my word he shall as soon as possibly I can, but on that condition that you will accept of him without marriage, upon his oath to have you. Flam. I see his Highness is mad (as every body saies) otherwise what should ail him to talk thus? most excellent Prince, he and I would not disagree. Trap. Well here is my hand, he shall come home shortly, now I must have a kiss and leave you: I am very hungry, I ha been so long a doing justice that I am very hungry, give me a buss sweetheart. Kisses her. Flam. Heaven bless your Highness. Exeunt severally. sena secunda. Enter Lavinio the great Duke, Isabella the Dutchess with Attendants. Lav. My hearts sweet solace, my dear Isabella You are most welcome unto Florence; Live according to your wishes happily, And may I perish if I do not strive In every thing to please you to my power; I'm sorry at my coming home I find Such strange and unexpected alterations, That for to quiet them I must deprive My self some houres of your company. Isab. Most Excellent Sir, I do account my self Most highly blest, that am not onely married Unto a Prince, but one that can And doth vouchsafe his love unto me, being Defective of those beauties should deserve it. To your affairs betake you Worthy Sir, I will expect you till your leisure serves. Lav. You are good unto a miracle Sweet Isabella—attend the Dutches in; Adieu my Love, some few but tedious minutes Past over I will come unto you. Isa. I will await your leisure. Exeunt with Isabella. Lav. What mad fantastick humours have possest In general the heads of the Florentines? They have amaz'd me, speak as if I Had been with them before my Dutchesse came. Barbarino and Machiavil appear in prison. Bar. You great commander of the Tuscan Cities, Pity your subjects, and your loyal servants; In what we sued for we had no design, Neither the least intent for to offend. Mac. Be merciful therefore most gracious Prince, Let not the noblest of the Florentines VVear out their daies and thraldom in a Prison, Being men not long ago high in your favour. Lav. I am lost within a Labyrinth of wonders, I know not what to think, the chiefest of The Florentine Nobility in prison, And sue to me as if I had commanded Them to this place; sure some ill spirit hath Possest mens minds while I was absent: do you Know me? Bar. Your Highness is the Duke our Master. Lav. Are you not called Barb. and you Macha. the Lords unto whom I left The government of Tuskany in My absence? Mac. We are your loyal subjects though your prisoners; and were left your Deputies when your Highness went to Milain. Lav. How came you there? Bar. Great Sir, you know most well, At your command. Lav. I must be satisfied in this: Puchanello so ho! Puch. Who calls? whats the matter I wonder. Within. Lav. Release me the Lords presently, and send them To me hither: The more I think of these accidents, The more I marvel how they come to pass; The men whom I did leave here governours Are prisoners (and which increaseth more Amazement in me) they say it was I That made them so; some unheard malady Unknown unto the world before it seems, Hath infected all my subjects with a frenzy. Enter Barberino and Machiavil. Bar. He hath chang'd his humor it seems. Mach. And may he continue in this if it be a good one. Lav. I am astonished to see the things I every minute do, especially You two (to whom I left the weighty charge Of rule) in prison; resolve me for heavens sake How you came there. Bar. Sure he doth jest with us. Mac. Your Highness is disposed to be merry; You know (most excelent Sir,) full well that none except your self could do it. Lav. I do it? Barb. He doth things in his madness he remembers not when he's in's right sences it seems. Lav. Florence I left a wise ingenious City; But I have found it now at my return Possessed with a strange unheard of madness: Who put you in prison? collect your wits in't order And answer wisely. Mac. I vow by the prosperity of Tuscany, Your Highness. Lav. Most strange! Why did I so? Bar. Because we did (most gracious Sir) give notice Unto you how the Princesse Prudentia, Your machless beauteous sister lov'd Brunetto. Lav. Whom? what Brunetto! Mac. Your prisoner taken in the Mantoan warrs. Lav. My sister so forget her self! I am Full of amazement: she that had refused The youthfull Dukes of Modena and Parma, Dote on a slave slighted by all the starrs! My sister also so to lose her sences, She that was wise, and honoured for her vertues! Sure also this same strange infection Of madness wood ha seis'd upon my self If I had stayd at home. I will not now So marvel at the common people, seeing The most discreet of the Nobility, And my own sister equally distracted. Mac. I hope he comes to himself again, he talks something more wisely then of late. Lav. It is a frequent thing to see a City Miserably groan under a heavy sickness, To have the Plague, or fierce diseases full Of danger, rage and even unpopulate places; But such a general phrenzy to possess And to distract all Florence, is a wonder, A miracle unmach'd in historie. Bar. How he talks as if all we were mad, and he had done nothing! Lav. Are you sure you are both in your right sences? Mac. Did once your Highness know us so? Lav. Yes. Bar. VVe are as free from any distraction As ever yet we were since we were born. Lav. You must both of you tho give me leave to think what I know. Enter Mattemoros. Ile trie an he be mad too. Cap. these Lords say I put them in prison, how say you? Mat. So your Highness did—he's distracted another way. Lav. Good Gods be merciful. Why? Mat. Because they spoke against Brunetto's liberty. Lav. He's in the same tale; Though they are all deprived of their sences, They do not differ. But why (good Cap.) answer me a little, Should I desire Brunetto's freedom, being Beloved by my sister as they say? Wood it not be a great dishonour, think you, Unto the Family of the Medices, That she should cast her self away upon one VVe do neither know whom, or whence he is? I pray you Captain, if that yet you have Any small remnant of your wit remaining, Reply according to it. Mat. And he be grown wise again, Heavens be praised. It is a certain truth your Highness speaks, That if your sister should bestow her self (Being a Princesse meriting so much For her unequal'd beauty, and her vertues) Upon a man such as you pleas'd to mention, It would be a great weakness in her; but you Your self I heard (most excellent Sir) To call Brunetto Prince Horatio, The second Sonne unto the Duke of Savoy. Lav. How, I call him so! truth Captain you Have heard these things which I did never say. Bar. You never heard him call Brunetto so. Mac. Never, this is the first time I ever heard of it. Lav. My wonder is so great, I do want words VVhereby to give it vent; I see that all My subjects being distracted think me mad. Mat. And more, so please your Highness, you did send Brunetto, whom you Prince Horatio called, Unto your sister, to bid her prepare Her self; for you within a day or two Would see them married. Lav. Enough, Captain, I swear unto you by my Dukedome, That rather I would send Brunetto (though He were the Duke of Savoys second son) To have his head struck off, then on that message You say I did. Mat. He doth remember nothing. Bar. If the Duke be come to his right sences again, I beseech the Gods keep him so. Mac. And I. Enter Horatio and Prudentia. Mac. Beseech your Highness look, let your own eyes Be witness of their mutual affection; Behold the Princess your sister and Brunetto: Let us withdraw where we may stand unseen, And you shall hear them talk what I have said. Hor. Dear Lady, you have raised me to a fortune So high, that when I look upon my self I am amaz'd, and wonder at your goodness. Pru. Most noble Prince, let my unfeigned love Excuse the weak expressions of my tongue; I'm glad my Brother bears so noble a mind, As to be willing to unite our bodies As we have done our hearts. Hora. Not only willing, divine Prudentia, But earnest for us; he doth seem to grieve That two such faithful lovers as we are Should live so long a sunder. Prud. It is a worthy nature in him. Lav. I can contain my self no longer: though this Be out of madness done I will not suffer it. Sister! Prud. Live long most worthy Brother happily. Lav. So should I wish for you, bore you a mind Deserv'd your self. Prud. What mean you Sir? Hor. Good Heavens be kind, and do not now undo What you have almost brought unto perfection; I fear his madness that once favoured me; Hath chang'd his mind to my undoing. Lav. I will but spend few words; are you a Son Of the Duke of Savoys? Hora. Your Highness knowes I am his second. Lav. Whether You are or no I care not; and if you be, My sister once deserv'd a better husband, And she shall rather in a Monastery Spend all her future dayes then be your wife: And be you what you will Sir, I will shew you That you have wronged me, and I do not fear The Duke of Savoy if he be your father. Puchanello, Puchanello come hither. Mac. I like this. Pru. He's wonderfully distracted—most worthy Brother, Be not so much unmerciful. Lav. Peace Prudentia, I never thought You had so weak a reason. Hor. He's mad to my undoing; gracious Gods, Soon make him leave this humour. Bar. I hope he's come unto himself. Enter Pucchanello. Lav. Sirra, convey Brunetto into prison, Lock him up close. Puc. Here's do and undo—Will our Duke nere be in his Right sences again? Prud. My dear Horatio, love me still, for I Unto thee will be constant though I die. Hor. Though I be tortured unto death my Dear. Exeunt with Horatio. Mat. I know not what to think of these alterations. Lav. Thus (but the heavens assist) I hope to bring Int' order from confusion every thing. Exeunt Omnes. Finis Actus quarti.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quintus Scena prima. Enter Trappolin solus. Trap. The Duke is come home, and therefore my hardest part is behind; Father Conjurer and you be not my friend now I am undone; Eo, Meo, and Areo sit you all close and lose not a jot of your vertue: happen what will as soon as I meet him his Highness, I will try the vertue of my powder on him, let him take it how he please. Enter Prudentia. Prud. Here is my brother, I will try him, perhaps He may have chang'd his sullen humor now, And set the Prince Horatio at liberty. Most excellent noble Sir. Trap. My dear sister, how dost thou do? why look you so sad, ha you got the green sickness to night with lying alone? and you have I will take an order for your cure very shortly, and to your liking too, I'le have you married within these two days at the furthest. Prud. Married Sir! unto whom? Trap. Unto my friend your lover, Prince Horatio. Prud. I am glad of this: Alas Sir, why then have you Made him a close unhappy prisoner? Trap. I see the Duke hath met with him: You do deceive your self Lady sister, indeed You do put up my friend in prison? heaven defend. Prud. Sir, pardon me for speaking truth, I heard When you commanded it. Trap. Sister mine, if I did I was drunk, and now I am sober I will let him out. Sirra Pucchanello, so ho. Prud. May he continue always in this vein Of kindness; thus his madness is not grievous. Trap. Madam sister, I am very sorry I was such a beast as in my drink to commit such a fault; I pray you forgive me. Enter Pucchanello. Pucch. What is your Highness will? Trap. It is that you set Prince Horatio at liberty, and send him hither presently. Pucch. I wonder—most willingly. Exit. Prud. You are a gracious Prince, and the high Gods Will recompence your pity unto lovers. Trap. What a Swine was I do such a thing! I am ashamed as often as I think on't, I shall be ashamed to look on my friend; sister, you must pray him to forgive me. Trap. Sir, trouble not your self, and be assur'd, Unless you part us, you can never do Offence either unto the Prince or me. Enter Horatio. Hora. It seems his mind is changed, the heavens be praised. Trap. Prince Horatio, an you do not forgive me my locking of you in prison, I shall never be merry again; I did it when I was drunk, and my sister knows that as soon as she told me on't, I sent for you; I pray you therefore forgive me good Prince Horatio. Hora. Most excellent Sir, I was a man unworthy Of this sweet Ladies love, did I not freely. Trap. I thank you i'faith Prince Horatio with all my heart I swear unto you, here take you my sister, take her by the hand, lead her whether you will, and do what you will unto her with her consent: I am very sorry I parted you so long; I know Lovers would be private, though they do nothing but talk, therefore I will not hinder you: fare you well both my Princely friend and Lady sister. Prud. The Gods preserve you. Hora. And reward your goodness. Exeunt. Trap. Thus what the Duke doth I will undo—such excuses will serve my turn well enough. Enter Barbarino and Macchavil. Here are my Lord banishers, it seems the Duke hath set them at liberty, but in they go again as sure as the cloaks on their backs. Bar. May the good angels that attend upon Princes on earth, defend your Highness always From every offensive thing. Macc. And may you live A long and happy life, enlarge your state, Excel in fame the first great Duke. Trap. Your good wishes I like, but credit me my Lord Banishers, neither of you. Who let you out of prison? Bar. He's mad as ere he was—your Highness Sir. Trap. You lye Sir: Pucchanello come hither quickly. Macc. Heavens be merciful, we must in again I see. He do's and undo's, and remembers nothing. Enter Pucchanello. Trap. Sirra Rogue, why did you set these two at liberty? Pucc. Your Highness did command it. Mac. If our Duke must be mad, the Gods grant him That which he had the last. Trap. You ill-fac'd rascal you lie. Pucc. Beseech your Highness remember your self, it Was at your command. Trap. It may be so, but I am sure I was drunk then, and now I am sober they shall in again; therefore take them with you, be gone I say. Barb. There is no remedy. Macc. Good gods pitty Florence. Exeunt. Trap. Eo, Meo, and Areo, thanks i'faith; yet I am suppos'd the Duke, Father Conjurer, by thy Art I am suppos'd a Prince; stick to me still and be my friend. Enter Isabella. Here is the Dutchess! Eo, Meo, and Areo, be true to me, and I'le have a kiss or two at the least. Isa. Sir you are fortunately met. Trap. Who are you Lady Madam? Isa. Do you not know Sir? Trap. I'de have you tell me. Isa. I never knew him so before, I am your Wife. Trap. I'me glad on't I promise you, come and kiss me then. Isa. You are wondrous merrily disposed. Trap. Madam Dutchess I am something jovial indeed, I have been a drinking Montefiascone very hard, kiss me again my dear Lady wife. Isa. He's drunk. Trap. You are a handsome woman I promise you: prethee tell me my Lady Dutchess, am I a proper handsome fellow? Isa. Do not jest with me Sir, you know you are Him whom above the world I do esteem. Trap. Well said my Ladie wife. Isa. I nere saw him so distempered before. Trap. Have you nothing yet in your belly? Isa. You know I am with child Sir. Trap. Faith but I do not, for your belly swells not. Isa. I am full of wonder. Trap. Lady wife get you in, I am halfe drunk, and now am unfit for you, but give me a kiss or two before,—Madam Dutchess fare you wel. Isab. I had thought he had not been addicted to A vice so loathsome as drunkenness. Exit. Trap. Yet all happens very well; protest the Dutchess is a gallant woman, I almost like her as well as Flametta; I could lie with her and I woo'd, but I am half honest, and will not wrong the Duke nor Flametta. Why is not my wench as good as she? wherein do they differ, but onely in clothes? Flametta's a woman as right as she, and perhaps naked as handsome: what good in the night do jewels and fine clothes to a woman when she hath them not on? besworn I am very merry; Eo Meo and Areo are brave tame Devils, and my Father Conjurer an excellent learned fellow. Vienca wine, and Padua bread, Trivigi tripes, and a Venice wench in bed. Exit singing. scena secunda. Enter Lavinio. Ye glorious Plannets that do rightly guide The giddy ships upon the Ocean waves, If some of your malignant influences Have rais'd this madness in my subjects heads, Let some of your benigne influences, Again restore them to their former sences: Those Florentines whom all their enemies Could not impeach, could not withstand in armes, Suffer not, you immortal powers divine, Thus to be ruin'd, by distraction. Machavil and Barbarino appear in prison. I am astonished, O Heavens, I know not what to think! Puchanello, Puchanello, let me out the two Lords, and send them to me presently, I'le talk unto um here at large. Bar. His ill fit's off. Mac. The goods be praised. Lav. I do not think that since the infancy And first creation of the world, a madness Pestiferous and equal unto this Was ever known; good Heavens reveal (and soon) The cause, that I may do my best to help it. Enter Barbarino, Machavil and Puchanello. Mac. Long may this fit continue. Barb. If it hold alwaies, sure he's in's wits agen. Lav. I wonder, Lords, and justly, that you whom I have known to have the noblest judgements, should thus become distracted; you in your fits of frenzie run to prison of your selves, And think I sent you. Bar. Most royal Sir, we grieve to see these daies; You did command us thither. Lav. I? Mac. Your Highness self. Lav. You are both deceiv'd; to do such idle errours, And lay the blame on me doth more amaze me. Puchanello how came these in prison? Puc. So please your Highness, you were angry with them And did commit them. Lav. I commit them? That thou art mad is not so great a wonder; I tell you both with sorrow, witness heaven, You are strangely bereav'd of your reason. Well, go ye in, and pray unto the Gods That they hereafter would be kind unto you And keep you from relapse. Mac. Heavens bless your Highness. Bar. And be unto you a perpetual guard. Exeunt. Lav. Famine, plague, war, the ruinous instruments Wherewith the incensed dieties do punish Weak mankind for misdeeds, had they all fallen Upon this city, it had been a thing To be lamented but not wondred at. Enter Isabella. O my dear Isabella! I have brought thee From Milain flourishing in all delights, Into a city full of men distracted. Isab. He is not sober yet. Go in and sleep Sir, You do not well thus to bewray your weakness Unto the publick view. Lav. My wife and all! O heavens! Isa. What say you Sir? Lav. My Isabella, thou hast cause to curse me For bringing thee into a place infected: The aire is sure pestiferous, and I wonder Now how I have escaped. Isab. Good Sir, I pray you sleep. Lav. Wherefore my Isabella? Isab. Why you have drunk too much. Lav. Madness unmatch'd! Dear Isabella, withdraw thy self into Thy chamber, I will presently come to thee, There we will pray unto the angry Gods That they would from's remove this heavy ill. Isab. I will obey you Sir to get you home; Good Gods nere let him thus offend again. Exit. Lav. What have I done so much offensive to The supreme powers, that they should punish me Not onely with the madness of my subjects, But the distraction of my wife and sister! Enter Horatio and Prudentia. What do I see? they do embrace and kiss: My sisters madness will undo her, how He came at liberty I marvel much; Whom I would have to lie in prison, walke in freedome, and whom I would have in freedome run of themselves to prison. Prud. Most noble Brother. Lav. Sister, I grieve to see thee thus. Hora. Excellent Prince! Lav. Sure the good Angels that had wont to guard The Medices in all their actions, Have for the horrid sins of Florence left us, And fled to Heaven. Hora. His mind again is altered. Pru. Dear brother, do not frown and look so angry. Lav. Peace sister, I'me asham'd to hear you speak, Each word you say is poyson in my eares. Puchanello, Jailor. Puc. I come. Within. Pru. What mean you Sir? Hor. I must again to prison, fickle fortune, How soon a happy man thou makest wretched! Enter Puchanello. Lav. Sirra, why did you set this man Brunetto, Or this Horatio (I know not what to call him,) At liberty? Puc. Will he nere be wise! your Highness bade me. Lav. I! Bethink you, and answer truly. Puc. Your Highness knowes I durst not for my life Ha don't without your licence. Pru. Sweet Brother. Lav. Silence would become you better far. Hor. Life of my heart, do not disturb your self, I am unworthy you should speak for me. Lav. Sirra, take him again, and look to him better then you have; your madness shall not excuse you, if once more you serve me thus. Hor. I must be patient: good Heavens, soone alter this sullen fit into his former kindness: Farewel my sweet Prudentia. Exeunt with Hora. Pru. I wonder Brother, what pleasure you take In crossing me after this sort. Lav. It is in vain to answer frantick people. Pru. I, I am mad, 'tis your perversness makes me. Exeunt. Scena tertia. Enter Trappolin solus. Trap. Yet I cannot meet with the Duke, I long to see him look like me, I would fain powder his Highness. Eo, Meo and Areo, I thank you faith, my hat, my glass, and cloke; honest Father Conjurer, I will love thee while I live. Enter Barbarino and Machavil. Hel's broke loose again, I do what the Duke undoes, and he undoes what I do. Mac. Long live your Highness. Trap. Amen. Bar. And happily. Tra. Amen I say; but how my small friends came you hither? I thought you had been under lock &amp; key. Mac. I fear he's ill as ere he was. Trap. Sirra Puchanello, so ho, so ho! come hither you rogue. Bar. We must in again. Mac. Good Gods, will this frenzie never leave him! Enter Puchanello. Trap. Goodman durty-face, why did you not keep me these in prison till I bid you let them out? Puc. So please your Highness so I did. Trap. Dare you lie so boldly? you take me for a Doctor, Gracian of Franckolin I warrant you, or a fool in a play, you'r so sawcy with me. Mac. Good Gods! Bar. Was ever heard the like? Puc. Beseech your Highness to remember your self. Trap. Now I bethink my self, perhaps I might do it when I was drunk; if I did bid you give them their liberty it was when I was fox't, and now I am sober lay them up agin; walk my good Lord Banishers, your Honours know the way. Puc. Will this humour never leave him? Bar. We must endure it. Mac. There is no remedy. Trap. My Lord Prisoners get you gone, I am an hungry and cannot stand to hear any supplication. Puc. You must obey my Lords. Exeunt. Trap. Yet all goes well, all goes exceeding well; My wil's obey'd, I am suppos'd the Duke; My hat, my glass and cloak retain their force, And Father Conjurer does not forsake me. Exit. Scena quarta. Enter Mattemoros the Spanish Captain solus. Mat. Though horrid War, thou bear'st a bloody sword, And marchest o're the world in dreadful arms; Though fearful mankind on their humble knees, Beseech the Gods to keep thee from their homes, Yet art thou (when trick'd up in dismall robes, Presaging death and ruine to a State) More lovely to a valiant souldiers eyes, Then are the pleasures of a wanton Court. And sure if our great Duke Lavinio Had been i'th field expecting of a foe, He nere had been distracted as he is: 'Tis peace that doth bewitch us from our selves, Fills most Heroick hearts with amorous toyes, And makes us to forget what honor is; But for Hipolita's sake I must not speak Any thing ill of Love; Love I must say Is good, but war leads the more noble way. Enter Lavinio. Lav. How do you Captain? Mat. I am your Highness creature. Lav. Saw you not lately Barbar. or Maccha? Mat. Yes. Lav. Where are they? Mat. Your Highness knows in prison. Lav. O heavens, in prison again! Good gods, when will you remove this frenzy from the Florentines? Mat. I see there is little hope on him. Lav. Why are they in prison? Mat. Because your Highness did command. Lav. Never, Captain, I never did command it; go and bid Pucchanello let them out. Mat. Sir, he dares not at my bidding. Lav. Here take my Ring and do't. Mat. One humor in the morning, and another in the afternoon, will it never be better? Exit. Lav. Wo'd I did know what hainous sin it is I have commited that is so offensive Unto the Gods to cause this punishment, That I might sue unto them for forgiveness, And they be reconcil'd and pitty Florence. I'm full, and full of wonder; perhaps some fiend, Permitted by the heavens, assume's my shape, And what I do undoth; was ever known Such a distraction in the world before? Enter Trappolin. Trap. At last I have found him. Lav. This the Impostor is that hath deceiv'd The eyes of all, it can be nothing else. Trap. I vow and swear I am something afraid, but I will be bold; Eo, Meo and Areo, sit close, come out powder, come out, father Conjurer I rely on your powder; Take that for my sake. (Flings it on him.) Lav. What rudeness is this? Trap. I have don't i'faith, Trap. I have repealed thee for Flametta's sake. Lav. How is this? If thou art a fiend, the gracious heavens be kind, And give a period to thy wild proceedings; But if thou art a Conjurer, I'le have thee Burnt for thy Magick, as thou dost deserve. Trap. Trappolin talk wisely. Lav. Why dost thou call me so? Trap. Aha! A man forget himself so! art thou not he? Lav. I am the Duke. Trap. Beware of treason; do you know your own face if you see't? look here; what say you now? Lav. I am bewich't, thou art a Conjurer, And hast transformed me to a banish't Rogue. Trap. For Flametta's sake I pardon thee this language, but learn to speak better lest you walk again. Exit. Lav. Heaven, earth and hell, have all agreed together To load me with a plague unknown before Unto the world: The heavens have given consent Unto my misery, hell hath plotted it, And the deceived earth believes me mad, And now will take me for a banish't Rogue. Enter Flametta. Flam. O joy above expression! behold My Trap. is come; Love, welcome home; Thou art beholding unto me (my Dear) 'Twas I that won the Duke for thy repeal. Lav. I am amazed. Flam. Give me a hundred kisses; let us spend An hour in kissing, afterwards we'l talk. Lav. Away. Flam. Have you forgotten me so soon? I am Thy true Flametta (lovely Trap.) Lav. Be gone I say. Flam. Dost thou reward me thus for all the pains I've took to get thee home again? Lav. Leave me Thou impudent whore, or I will kick thee hence. Flam. O faithless men! Women, by me take heed You give no trust unto this perjur'd sex. Have I all thy long banishment been true, Refused Lord Barbarino with all his gifts; And am I slighted thus? I will complain Unto his Highness of thee. Enter Mattemoros. Lav. Have you don't. Mat. What? Lav. Have you let the Lords at liberty? Mat. What's that to thee? Lav. Give me my Ring. Mat. He has heard the Duke sent me with his Ring, and this impudent Rogue dares think to get it. Sirra, is it not enough to be a Coward and a Pander, but you wo'd be a thief too? Lav. I am bewitched. Flam. I fear my Trappolin is turned mad man. Lav. Suffer not this ye Gods. Enter Trappolin. Mat. I have set the Lords Barbarino and Macc. at liberty according to your Highness order; and here is your Ring again. Trap. Better and better—I marle where the Prince Horatio is. Mat. He forgets every thing, he's in prison. Trap. Sure he is not. Lav. How this Impostor divel acts me! Mat. Your Highness did commit him. Trap. Fie upon't, what things do I do in my drink? here take my Ring, go and set him out, and come hither with him presently. Lav. I am the Duke, and will be obey'd, Go not upon your life, he shall lye there. Flam. Sure my Trappolin's run mad for grief in his banishment. Mat. Peace (frantique) peace, do not disturb his Highness. Trap. Regard not mad men, go. Mat. I'm gone. Exit. Lav. Thou traitor. Fam. Dear Trappolin be silent, regard my tears, thou wilt undo thy self. Trap. Maiden and your Sweet-heart continue thus, I'le have him sent abroad again. Enter Prudentia. Flam. Sweet Trappolin for my sake hold thy tongue Lav. I rage in vain, good heavens be merciful. Prud. Dear brother pity me, regard my sorrow, Release the Prince Horatio, and no longer Separate their bodies whose hearts the Gods have joyned. Trap. Sister, have patience a little, a very little, Prince Horatio will be here presently, and Ile make an end with you. Lav. Prudentia, art thou not asham'd? Pru. What sawcines is this! Most worthy noble Brother all my heart is full of thanks for you: wood Ide a tongue could utter them. Enter Mattemoros and Horatio. Mat. Your Highness ring. Trap. Tis well: Captain, Sister, and Prince Horatio, Here take my signet, by the warrant of it, go And get you married, Hor. Our humble thanks. Lav. I do want patience. Hor. Tis best to do it while he's in's good humor: Are you content Sweet Princesse? Pru. With all my soul I go. Exeunt. Lav. Sister, sister. Mat. Peace lest you be soundly punisht Sirra. Fla. Good Trappolin be quiet. Lav. I am the Duke, I am Lavinio; This is a fiend of hell or an Impostor. Mac. Will your Highness suffer this? Trap. I pity him, he knows not what he saies. Lav. I am bewitched. Mat. I am sure thou art distracted. Trap. A done you had best. Lav. Thou enemy unto our happiness, Know the Gods will relent; in time be wise. Trap. There is no remedy, he must go to Puchanello: so ho, Pachanello, so ho. Puch. I come. Within. Flam. There could come no better of it, beseech your Highness pardon him, he's distracted. Lav. You are all distracted, all bewitched. Enter Puchanello. Trap. Sirra take Trap. and lock him up safe. Flam. You'd take no warning. Lav. O Florence, how I pity thy decay. Trap. Away with him. Mat. Puchanello take him, and be gone. Trap. You of the Guard see him laid safely up. Lav. I will not go. Puch. We then might force you. Exeunt. Flam. Alas poor Flametta! Thy Trappolin cares not for thee, I beseech the Gods to give him his right sences again. Trap. Come Captain. Mat. I attend your Highness. Exeunt. Scena Quinta. Enter Barbarino and Machiavil. Mach. The strange distraction of our Duke will give Sufficient matter unto Chronicles To make whole volumes of him. Bar. Yet he believes himself right in his sences And we out of our wits think him mad. Lavinio appears in Prison. Lav. Wood I had been born to a mean estate, So in't I might have lived happily. The greater honours that men have, the greater Their troubles are; the begger that hath nothing Lives a more quiet life then Monarchs do. Lord Barbarino, and Lord Machavil, Get me releas'd, I am the Duke Lavinio, Bewitched as you are by an Impostor. Bar. Go Trappolin and sleep: we have heard all, Thou art run mad. Mac. Go sleep poor Trappolin. Lavin. Be kind good Gods, pity our miseries. Bar. Leave talking and go sleep. Enter Trappolin. Mac. His Highness. Bar. How fares our noble master? Trap. I have not been sober a day together this good while; Eo, Meo and Areo have made me fox't, but now I will leave it. Mac. Who are they? Bar. I know not. Trap. It's in vain to lay them up any more, I having had sport enough with them. Trappolin whom you banisht is come home stark mad. Mac. Exceedingly. Bar. And raves most strangly in prison. Enter Flametta. Flam. Here is his Highness, I will not leave him till He doth release from prison Trappolin. Most excellent Sir, perfect your noble kindness; Give liberty unto poor Trappolin. Trap. With all my heart I would, wood he be quiet. Flam. Alas he is distracted, and doth not know VVhat he sayes; and therefore why should you regard him? Trap. VVell, fair maid, for thy sake that lovest him so he shal come out. Puchanello so ho! come hither. Bar. He will do any thing, and undo any thing. Mac. Sure there was never such a Duke i'th world. Enter Horatio and Prudentia. Trap. VVelcome Sister and Brother (I hope I may say,) are you married? are you content? tell me if any thing remains that I can do for you, speak it, for I am ready, the Duke Your servant. Pru. Most worthy brother, you have perfected our joyes, for we are married. Pru. I am very glad Lady sister that you are so. Hora. Here is your Highness ring. Enter Puchanello. Trap. You Sirra of chains and keyes set me Trappolin at liberty presently, and send him hither. Puc. VVill he never be wise? I wood he wood make another Jaylor, I am weary of the place, I can never be at quiet for putting in and setting out. Flam. The Heavens reward your goodness. Ex. Puc. Trap. Brother and Prince Horatio, I am something given to be drunk, Eo, Meo and Areo are good fellows: but I pray you pardon me. Hora. Sir, you wrong yourself. Trap. My friend, and Prince Horatio, I'le nere wrong myself I warrant you; but you I have, and my sister Prudentia: but it was when I was fox't, and I will never be so again. Enter Mattemoros and Hipolita. Mac. I am glad he will once let us be quiet. Bar. I should be very glad if he would continue it. Trap. Ho now Seignior Captain! ha you got a sweetheart? Mat. A fair Mistress so please your Highness. Trap. I see, my Don at Armes, when you cannot follow the wars of the field, you will of the bed. Enter Lavinio. Flam. Prethee my Trappolin, now hold thy tongue. Be wise sweet Love. Lav. Leave me thou frantick fool. Trap. For Flametta's sake I have given you your liberty, use it well. Lau. O Heavens, endure not this impostor thus With his enchantments to bewitch our eyes. Mac. Will he suffer him? Bar. Perhaps one mad man wil pity another. Lav. Ye Florentines, I am Lavinio, I am the Tuskan Duke, this an enchanter, That by his magick Art has raised all These strange chimeraes in my Court. Mat. Your Highness is too patient, it were more fit he rav'd in Prison. Flam. Sweet Trappolin be rul'd. Trap. Hold your tongue I say. Hor. Poor Trappolin, art thou distracted too? Lav. You Lords of Florence, wise Machavil, and You Lord Barbarino, will you never come Out of this frenzie? Valiant Mattemoros, I am the Duke, I am Lavinio: This whom you do suppose is me, is some Hellish Magician that hath bewitched us all. Trap. He will not be rul'd: Puchanello take him again. Flam. Beseech your Highness: Trappolin, come away. Prud. Was ever seen the like? Lav. Ah my poor subjects! how I pity you, That must obey the monstrous wickedness Of one that works by Necromantick means, And is forsaken by the blessed Gods! Trap. Away with him. Enter Mag. Mag. Stay. Trap. Yon's Father Conjurer. Bar. What new accident is this! Trap. I hope he'l do no hurt. Hora. What will the event be (marle?) Mat. What old Long-beard's this? Mag. A word with you, Will you, if I clear every thing, Pardon what's past? Lav. Do you know me then? Mag. You are the Duke. Trap. Father Conjurer, do no hurt, and I'le give you a hundred pistols to buy you sallets and oile it'h wood. Mag. I'le talk with you even now; Will you promise me? Lav. I swear by all the honours of my state, By both my Dukedomes, Florence and Sienna, I will forgive what ever's past. Mag. Him and all? Lav. Him and all. Trap. Good Father Conjurer, remember your son. Mac. What will come of this? Mag. Be not affrighted. Mat. Never, not I. Mag. What ere you see, Fear not, nothing shall hurt you. Prud. This is a Conjurer. Hip. Sweet Captain stand close by me. Bar. What strange events are these! Mag. Eo, Meo, and Areo, appear. Trap. I am undone I fear. Father Conjurer, remember your son, I'le give you two hundred pistols. Mag. Appear I say. Enter Eo, Meo, and Areo. Prud. Alas! Hor. Fear nothing. Hipo. Oh me! Mat. Be bold, I am here Hipolita. Mag. Go take the hat, the glass, and cloke from him. Trap. Ah me! Ah me! here, here, here, here, come not too near me. Eo, Meo, and Areo, farewel all on you; Father Conjurer has undone me. Bar. Trappolin. Mac. Two Trappolins. Flam. I know not which is mine. Mag. Attend a while. Thus with the waste of this enchanted wand I do release your Highness. Mat. The Duke. Hor. Wonders. Mag. You have engaged your word, y'ave pardon'd all, me who have done and undone every thing, and him, and every body. Lav. I have. Mac. The Heavens be prais'd; long live your Highness. Omnes. Long live the Duke. Hor. What will become of me? Mag. I'le perfect every thing; Brave Prince Horatio, your elder Brother, Prince Filberto is dead, Sir, you cannot, With reason dislike this match, they are. Married, and your consent doth perfect it. Lav. Now I am assured he is a Turin Prince, Heir to the Dukedome of Savoy, I am glad They are espoused: sister I wish you joy; Sir, I intreat forgiveness for what's past. Hor. All's forgotten. Prud. Thanks gracious Heavens. Lav. I'le have your wedding solemnized with state. Mac. I am glad this Gordian knot's untied. Trap. I shall be hang'd Father Conjurer. Mag. The Duke hath pardoned you and me all. Trap. Then let Eo, Meo, and Areo go to the Divel from whence they came. Flametta, I am thine. Flam. Ah my dear Trappolin! Trap. Here is your Highness ring. Mag. From henceforth I abjure my wicked art. Hor. I for thy love to me will send thee into Piemondt, and give thee an Earldome in Vercelly. Trap. The Heavens reward you: you know I alwaies made much of your Highness Majesty. Fla- thou shalt be a Countess. Mag. Son Trappolin, I am thy natural father, twenty years since banisht ten years from Florence: through my misfortune I have served the Turk in his Gallies. Trap. By your leave Father you have served the Divel too I'me sure: for you are one of the best Conjurers in the world. Welcome unto the Court, your son of Honour, and to Flametta's Earlship: will your Honours forgive me too? Mac. Yes. Enter Isabella. Bar. For the Princes sake I do. Trap. I thank you both: now all's well agen, henceforth I will live honestly and be the Divels Butcher no longer. Lav. My Isabella welcome; every thing That did molest our happiness in Florence Is took away, now we will spend our time In Courtly joyes; our famous Tuskan Poets Shall study amorous Comedies and Masks, To entertain my beauteous Millaness: I have a story full of ridiculous wonders, Within to tell thee at our better leisure. Trap. The weaker side must yield unto the stronger, And Trappolin's suppos'd a Prince no longer. Exeunt omnes. Finis actus quinti &amp; ultimi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Ladies and Gentlemen, you that now may Approve (or if you please) condemn our Play, We thank you first; for here it was not writ In sweet repose and fluencies of wit; But far remote, at Rome begun, half made At Naples, at Paris the conclusion had. Yet the perfection is behind, which (if You give's a Plaudite) you in England give; Our Nation's courteous unto strangers, nor Should you refrain unto this Traveller. I must not sue; Ther's nothing now remains, Saving the Guerdon of our Poets pains: He for himself is careless, onely wo'd, That for the Actors sakes you'd say 'tis good. We are doubtful yet, your hands will set all right; Do what you please, and (Gentlemen) Good night. FINIS.</field>
