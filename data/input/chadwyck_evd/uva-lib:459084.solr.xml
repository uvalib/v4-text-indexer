      <field name="fulltext">HUGO GROTIUS HIS Sophompaneas, OR IOSEPH. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Right Honourable, Henry, Lord Marquess of Dorchester, Earl of Kingston, Viscount Newark, Lord Pierrepont, &amp;c. My Lord, Not any merit of mine hath emboldned mee to set forth this piece with (so resplendent a Frontispiece) your Name; but a duty of doing one of our best modern Latin Poets that full right, which my pen otherwise comes short of. Bee pleased likewise, that Sophompaneas, a divinely inspir'd Prophet, and Royall favourite, famous in holy Writ (which your own eminent virtues will most like) for wisdome and chastity, may find a favourable entertainment with your Lordship. I am not ignorant upon how great disadvantage anything of this kind is presented unto your Lordship, after Iuvenal by Sir Robert Stapylton. Neither have I, though I much more need it, the warrant of your Lordships command, which might beg pardon for my disabilities and errataes: Yet this free-will &amp; cheaper offering may not be unacceptable to your most noble goodnesse, and that this Coat of Ioseph is not so sullied with my handling, but that it may bee known, is the confidence and ambition of Your Lordships most humble Servant, Francis Goldsmith.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Preface. If an account is to bee given the Commonwealth, as Cato thought, even of our idlenesse; take then, at thine owne leasure, this of mine. For such and no better may a grave Censor deeme it, though I write after a most learned Copy, and have the priviledge of a Divine Argument. Yea, I my selfe, had I not the allowance of some friends, both candid and judicious, would sooner commit these Papers to the light of the fire, then of the Sun. It may likewise be a question perhaps, whether an Interpreter deserve the name of a Poet; but he, that is one indeed, a Virgil or Homer need not envy a Cicero or Demosthenes. “I had rather saith Tacitus (or who else is the Author) in Dialog. d. Orator. have the secure and secret retirement of Virgil, wherein yet he neither wanted the favour of Augustus Cæsar, nor the being taken notice of by the People of Rome: Witness the Epistles of Augustus, witness the People themselves, who upon hearing some verses of Virgil in the Theater, rose all up, and did the same reverence to Virgil, by chance then present, and a spectator, as unto Augustus. Our Author is an excellent and admirable patterne, not onely for Poetry and Oratory, but all Divine and humane learning; I would gladly follow the best examples, and overtake them, when any other of my endeavours shall from the Father of lights (from whom every good and perfect gift commeth down) receive such a blessing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Gerardus Vossius, Professor of History and civill Arts, in the most flourishing City of Amsterdam, Hugo Grotius.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vossius in Addend. l.2. Institut. Poetic. The question is, whether it bee lawfull to make a Dramatique Poem of a sacred argument: if examples may be pleaded; Ezekiel a Iewish Tragique Poet, hath written the deliverance of the Israelites out of Egypt. There is likewise extant Christs Passion, whether by Gregory Nazianzen, or Apollinaris of Laodicea. Neither have there been wanting in our age famous men also, who have written sacred Dramatiques both Comicall and Tragicall: But I am rather of opinion, it were better to choose another argument, then sacred. For it agrees not with the majesty of sacred things to be made a play and fable. It is also a work of very dangerous consequence to mingle humane inventions with things sacred; because the Poet adds uncertainties of his owne, sometimes falsities; which is not onely to play with holy things, but also to ingraft in mens minds uncertaine opinions, and now and then false.—These things have place especially, when we bring in God, or Christ, speaking, or treat of the mysteries of Religion. I will allow more where the History indeed is taken out of the sacred Scriptures, but in the nature of its argument is civill. As if the action bee of David flying from his Sonne Absolon, or of Joseph sold by his Brethren; advanced by Pharaoh to the government of Egypt, and in that dignity adored by, and made known unto his Brethren. Of which argument is Sophompaneas, made by the most illustrious and incomparable man, Hugo Grotius, Embassador, when hee lived, of the most gracious Queen and Kingdome of Sweden, to the most Christian King of France. Which Tragedy I suppose may be set for a pattern to him that would handle an argument fetcht from the holy Scriptures; and I would even more commend it in this place, then which a fitter could not be; did I not fear, I might seem to do it as well in regard of that love, which was ever between us, as also in officiousnesse of a gratefull minde, forasmuch as hee would have this excellent Poem come forth into the light, dedicated unto my name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his own old dear Francis Goldsmith, Esq; So doth the toiling Husbandman at last, Feed full his longing mind, his eye, and taste, When once into his own hands he doth get That Pear or Plum which the same hands had set. A modest pride so flatters me, to see What was my kernell once, now grown a Tree. So on the Cart, the poor Fly doth out thrust Its Tiffan wings, as if it rais'd the dust. I thank'd thee thee for thy Catechisme before, But Sophompaneas much augments the score: His Brethren and his Fathers Father he, Brethren and Father both doth find in thee. Thou bringst him Spice, Balme, our best English Honey, And (in thy learned notes) bringst double Money. Jacob in Syria, and Egypt, made him live, Another life in Britaine thou dost give. But how doth Grotius indebted stand To thee, that mak'st him Denison of our Land? Go on dear Frank, and let thy pious toil, Transport, translate, enrich our barren Soil With all his spoiles, that are (all are) of worth, His Gallo-Belgick labours have brought forth. Teach us his Laws of war (but rather peace) Teach us his Christian Truth, that may encrease, And here produce of Faith a plenteous breed, (We have some Indians here stand much in need.) Teach us by him Gods word to understand: These Works, my Frank, call for thy worthy hand. In the mean time though more of thee we crave, We thankfully accept of what we have. This Joseph, and thy Catechising us, Shall stile thee new, rise Francis Grotius. —Mihi Nulla rura, at Spiritum Graiæ tenuem Camænæ Parca non mendax De Dit, &amp;—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Somnium Dramaticum Synesii Iunioris, Cognomento Chirosophi. The evil of the Day had tyred light, Glad to fall into the darke armes of Night. When Moses sacred Genesis had fed My thoughts so full, that in my active Head The waking Phant'sie wrought the holy Theame Into the forme of a Dramatique Dreame. Methought I saw fair Joseph, while they cry'd Abrech before Him, in great honour ride; The tender Father of the King proclam'd: Zapnath-paaneah by great Pharo nam'd. I took three sips of his Divining Cup, Which heightned my Prophetique spirit up To such a pitch, that I could soon unfold All Secrets the Synesian Riddles hold. The silver Goblet (upon Arts command) Turn'd to refined Gold within his Hand; The Scenes were with all properties endu'd, Could heighten a Majestique Enterlude. The Acts (rehears'd) might reconcile the Stage To chasterears, and purifie the Age. Things were so done; there did more lustre spring From his rich Buskin, then from Pharo's Ring. The Plaudit was so loud at every clause, I wakened with the Eccho's of applause. The Day return'd: upon my thoughts review, I found my Dream, in your Translation, true. So well perform'd: it will extend the Fame Of reverend Grotius, and advance Your name. Thus while with pious thoughts the learned strive To infuse new life, Joseph is yet alive! Increasing still for others, as of old, 'Twill be his fortune to be bought and sold. But friend, I think 'twas the best chance of wit, To finde a Patron for the Poem fit. T'ignoble greatness for to prostitute Thy Joseph, did not with thy honour suite. Such who affect Effeminate extremes, Would make him blush for to expound their Dreames. Debauch'd and empty Lords, whose poppy heads Now Levell-switcht, fall to their earthly beds. But thou hast chose one, high, rich, learned, good, With all the virtues of enobled blood. Where worth doth over mens affections sway, There will the sons of Art their Tribute pay. Chirosophus Francisco Chrysergo Grotio, Amicitiæ &amp; Cognominis Ergo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Subject, Joseph. The Poet, Hugo Grotius. The Translator, F. Goldsmith. Joseph! Thou Heir of Love! in whom wee find Fair Rachels Face, and holy Jacobs Mind. Their Darling, Egypts Idol, Heavens Delight, Both Pharaohs, and Jehovahs Favourite. Chast, Fair, Just, Great, None such Live in our Daies: We can but act thy Actions in Playes. Grotius! Thy Exile was the Worlds good Fate, Which to thy Books redeem'd thee from the State: Our common Playes blush at thy Tragedy, The Law, and Life of Christian Poetry. For Action Joseph I would wish to be; For Writing, Grotius, I most honour thee. Frank! Thou to us his Catechisme didst give, There Teaching, and here showing how to live. Sands in Christs Passion did before thee go In Tragick steps, which thou hast followed so, That were your Names conceal'd, it might be said, One did them both Translate, as One them made. S. Gott.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his honoured Friend, Francis Goldsmith, Esq; Upon his Translation of, &amp;c. Friend, did my fame and Muse shine forth as bright As the renowned Ben's, then would that light Like th'hour telling Sun, the Rectifier Of Clocks and Watches, shine to the whole quire Of common censu'rers, who would each correct His peccant humor by my Dialect. And their fond fancies pinning on my slieve, Without examination would believe: But since my humble Muse could never soar Parnassus height, nor is so popular To make all vote with me, let thy own worth, Thy well couch'd Phrase, neat lines, not tumbled forth By a Pye-corner Muse or wild sick braine, But the most noble issue of thy veine Speaks its own praise only, let these have grace, To stick like patches on a beauteous face. Tho: Berney.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The History is recorded by Moses, Gen. 44 &amp; 45 Chapters, with the contexts there adjoyning: Psal. 105. Acts 7. by Philo in the life of Joseph; by Josephus in his second book of the Jewish antiquities, and partly by Justin out of Trogus Pompeius the 36 Booke: It is extant also in Astapanus out of Alexander Polyhistor, and in Demetrius 2 the places you may see in Eusebius his preparation to the Gospel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Translators This neither the Latin, nor Greek Tragick Writers use: But why may not they, as well as the Comick, commend the person of the Poet? or to win benevolence, and attention, expound the argument?

Here no Medea her own Children kils, Nor Hercules the Stage with horror fils: The Poet your delight and profit seeks, (Not borrowing a Fable from the Greeks;) But from the sacred Oracles of Truth, Where chaster then Hippolitus a Youth High Providence did out of Prison bring, To save and rule a Nation and a King. And after twenty yeers, who dead was thought, Is by his Sire and Brethren found unsought. If yet the Interpreter or Argument, Shall not to Criticks give a full content: Who look for sadder straines, and that we tread, More loftily in tragick buskins, read His Christus Patiens made yours by Sands, Which to admire and love the World commands. But above all two Champions appear, The noble Falkland there, and Vossius here.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The First Act. JOSEPH. Chasing againe the Night his glorious head The Sun shewes to the world, as from his bed A Bridegroom rising comes in rich array Out of his chamber] or veile, as our English Geneva translation hath it in the marginall note, Psal. 19. v. 6. Upon which Aretius Felinus a Commentator: The manner was among the Hebrews, and is observed even at this day, that having spred a vaile they deliver the Bride to the Bridegroom under it, out of which he comming forth exhilarates all, and the wedding feast begins. To which also Jo. Baptist alluded when he said, The friend of the Bridegroom rejoyceth, when he heareth the Bridegrooms voice, Jo. 3. 29. So, the sun rising, and the morning putting forth its golden head into the world, the face of the Universe is in a wonderfull manner refreshed, and as it were renewed.

From this Nation silke (cal'd in Latine Sericum) was brought into Persia: From Persia, conquer'd by Alexander, into Greece. From Greece, the Roman Empire flourishing, into Rome; where a pound of silk was sold for a pound of gold. Untill Justinian the Emperour not liking to pay so dear for garments to the Persian his enemy, by good hap two Monks came out of India, who told Cæsar of the silk-wormes, and that the wormes could not be brought to Constantinople, but the eggs might, out of which the worms would breed. The Monks therefore were sent back to fetch the eggs. And from hence is all that kind of silk-wormes, which we have at this day in Europe. But the more vulgar opinion was, that silke was carded or comb'd from the boughs and barkes of trees. Whence Virgil. 2. Geor. v. 120. Or th'Æthiopian woods white with soft wool?

Bright Pearles a present from the Indian.] Among the Indians and Persians Pearles are found in hard white shels of sea fish, and bred at a certaine time of the yeere by mixture of dew, which they take in with often gaping. That this kind of jewell also, though not so good, is bred and gathered in the Brittish sea wee are not ignorant. Ammian. Marcellin. And to the like purpose Pliny, l. 9. c. 35. It is certain that small and discoloured Pearls are bred in Brittain, whereas the commendation of them consists in whitenesse, greatnesse, roundnesse, smoothnesse, weight: yet in hope of the Brittish pearles, such as they were, Julius Cæsar, saith Suetonius, first went into Brittaine, and consecrated a Brest-plate of them to Venus his progenitrix. See Sir H. Savil, upon Tacit. in the life of Agricola. I will speak first of pearls, as Tertullian saith, precious in the very name. The Latines call them Uniones, not because there are never two found together, but because no two are found unsever'd. That the shels open and shut themselves is certain enough. But they are said to open in the night, that from the Lunar aspersion, that is, the dew, they may conceive. This is Pliny's opinion, and thence of Solinus, and from him of Ammian. Marcel. But though this may bee true of the Land shell, yet it will bee false of the sea shell, as even this is an argument, that whereas of the shels some are at the bottome, others float, and swim on the top of the sea; these on the superficies are the least. I know they may answer, the shels goe to the bottome assoon as they have conceived: but the shells having the biggest Pearles are bred in the bottome, and wander not, but stick there, so that the Diver must often sink twenty fat home for them.

Against them who extoll favour and power, let him set leasure imploy'd in studies and a mind turn'd back from externall things to its owne. Let him shew these in the vulgar opinion happy ones, trembling and astonish'd at their owne envyed height, and thinking far otherwise of themselves then they are esteem'd by others: For what unto others seem high places, unto themselves are precipices. Then are they heartlesse and quaking as often as they look down from that steep height of their greatnesse; For they think on the various casualties, and most slippery to them that are aloft, then they fear what they coveted, and the felicity which makes them heavy to others lies heavier on themselves: Then they praise a still quietnesse and freedome, they hate splendor, and fly from their yet unshaken state; then may you see them for feare playing the Philosophers; and sound counsels of a sick minde.

For when the world in her illustrious seat, Shall gaze on thee, thy fame must needs be great; But whether good or bad this in thee lies. Now go we to survey the Granaries, Her store where this great City doth reserve, Lest from my charge in any part I swerve. Chorus. The Chorus is a part of the Fable after the Act, or even before it, brought in with Musicke: Yet not only is understood by the name of Chorical what is sung, by the Quire, but also what is said by it. The Chorus is also defin'd, a part of the Fable between Act and Act. But not so aptly: because the Chorus hath place likewise after the last Act. Sealiger defines it, l. 1. c. 9. a part of the Fable after the Act with Musick. But the Fable also begins from the Chorus; as in Eschylus's Persæ, and Euripides's Rhesus. I beleeve, because it is very unusuall; Scaliger thought that there was no regard to be had thereof. The office of the Chorus is very well expressed by Horace in Art. Poetic. An Actors part and office too, the Quire Must maintain manly, not be heard to sing Between the Acts a quite clean other thing Then to the purpose leads, and fitly 'grees. It still must favour good men, and to these Be won a friend; It must both sway and bend The angry, and love those that fear to offend. Praise the spare diet, wholesome justice, laws, Peace, and the open ports that peace doth cause: Hide faults, pray to the gods, and wish aloud Fortune would love the poor, and leave the proud. B. Jonson. The Chorus after the fifth Act was of another nature then the former. For it often as a Judge gave sentence of those things which had bin acted; But this, as it is observed by the Greeks, so it is for the most part omitted by Seneca. The Chorus consisted of women, or men: not children, who are not enough fitted to act things; nor hath their speech that weight in comforting, admonishing, &amp;c. which are the parts of the Chorus: Sometimes it sung not, but did only speak; For when the Chorus was entred upon the Stage, it never went quite off: but, during the Play, some indeed went in with the Actors, the rest staid still. Lest therefore the Actors being present it should seem altogether idle, sometimes they interrupted the Actors, but in a few words, and when but two were talking together. If a third were present, the Chorus expected till he were gone. Thus much concerning the nature of the Greek and Latine Chorus out of Vossius's Institut. Poetic. l. 2. c. 6. Whither I refer you for further instruction; as likewise to my Fellow-Translator of Grotius's Catechisme, in his preface to his Electra of Sophocles. In a rich bed, her Lord gone thence, With his Propheticke eloquence, Asenath] Who was given a wife to Joseph, the daughter not indeed as many think, of the Keeper of the Prison, by name Potiphar, who bought Joseph of the Ishmaelites; (for by reason of the notorious immodesty of his wife, he might justly have refused the daughter) but of the Priest, or rather Prince of On; that is, Heliopolis, whose name was Potiphe-rah Voss.

Our hair in circling waves doth run, Not curl'd with Irons, but the Sun. With noses flat, &amp;c.] A flat nose, thick lips, and a black skin is esteem'd the greatest beauty among the Æthiopians, who paint the devill white. But, how to judge of true beauty, see in one of Bacons Essaies; and in another of those, which my once School-fellow but ever honoured Samuel Gott, hath lately put forth.With noses flat and skin like jeat, Made black by too contiguous heat; Thick are our lips where fenced lie, Our teeth as white as ivory. O happy house, which govern'd art By a chast couple with one heart. The Children like the Father, known Are by their looks to be his own: Which makes the vertuous mother glad; Nor doth her Lord, after the bad Custome of barbarous Princes] Tacitus hath it, how that in his time the Germans almost alone of all barbarous Nations were content with single wives. Which also appeares every where in the Histories of both the Persians and Indians. Grot. d. jur. bell. &amp;c. l. 2. c. 5. § 9. See likewise there, why it was not unlawfull for the Patriarks to have many wives. And how Polygamy was disliked by the wiser sort of the Heathen. Of the not onely many but incestuous marriages of the Parthians, you may read in our English Luc. 1. 8. The Venus of those barbarous Courts who hears not? Which like bruit beasts all wedlock rites exile, And with wives numberlesse all Laws defile: Th'incestuous beds abhorred secrets lie Ope to a thousand Concubines, rais'd high With wine and banqueting; the King refraines No lawless lust, though ne're so full of staines, &amp;c.Custome of barbarous Princes range, Who every night their wives do change; Whereby is strife and hatred sown, But he delights in her alone: And in his honest brest no room Is for strange fires; to overcome Which, he did know long since, when he, Though but a servant, yet more free Then his vile mistris, did despise The glance of her adulterous eyes. With naked brests and wanton speech, Who might command, did first beseech; Then threaten, but against a rock, In vain the foaming billowes knock. Would you, saith he, have me no lesse Commit, then threefold wickednesse. Madam, should I dishonour you, And to my Lord prove most untrue; Breaking the trust he puts me in, And against God should I thus sin? O thou, who guid'st the starry sphear, Ordering the Seasons of the Year: The spring with Roses thou dost crown, In Summers heat corn ripe is grown. Then Autumne purple grapes brings forth, Then comes cold winter from the North. How stands it with thy providence, &amp;c.] A weake Christian may herein be satisfied by the wise Heathen Seneca's Answer to Lucilius's Quære, Why good men suffer misfortunes, seeing there is a Divine Providence. But see likewise Grot. d. verit. Chr. Rel. l. 1.How stands it with thy providence, That Vice should tread on Innocence?

Among his fellow prisoners he, Is made a Judge; and when they see What life he leads, and by it try Their own, they all do guilty cry, God neither doth quite hide his way From us, nor yet it quite display. His Children he keeps in a state Not wanton, not too delicate. As a good Captaine doth enure, His Souldiers hardship to endure: So the great Father of us all, Whom he doth love, will have to fall Into affliction, lest the Soul Through ease, should grow corrupt and foul. Yet leaves he not them comfortlesse, But in the midst of their distresse Courage unto his own doth give, Who with glad hope in patience live] Because they understand all those afflictions to bee sent from God, either for chastisement of sinnes, or for exercising of their virtues, they not onely patiently but joyfully, as obedient children, receive them from the hands of a mercifull Father, and give thanks also, either for a mild correction, or an inestimable advantage. Erasm. Colloq. Epicur.Who with glad hopes in patience live.

Hence he presag'd what happen'd since, And in a Prison was a Prince.

In his voice God dwels. Thus flow'd adversities rough stream, Till the King troubled with a dream] The consideration of dreames is not altogether to be rejected, which neither Physitians themselves contemne; whence there is extant a Booke of Hippocrates ???? ????????. Yet this must bee done warily, lest wee mingle false things with true, which when Aristotle saw to be done of many, it made him say, that there are no divine dreames, though to him who throughly looks into that book, will appear footsteps of a contrary opinion. Surely the wisest sort have rightly distinguish'd dreames into divine and humane. Spondanus in Homers Ilia. l. 1. v. 63. ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ???? ?????. On which see likewise, Plin. Epist. to Suetonius Tranquil. l. 1. God revealed himselfe, and his will frequently in old times, especially before the sealing of the Scripture Canon, by dreames; sometimes even to Infidels, as Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, &amp;c. But since the preaching of the Gospel became Oecumenicall, dreames, as also Miracles, have ceased to be of ordinary and familiar use: So as now, we ought rather to suspect delusion in them, then expect direction from them. Yet, although God hath now tyed us to his holy written Word, he hath no where abridged himselfe to intimate the knowledge of his will, and the glory of his might by dreames, miracles, &amp;c. But because the Devill may suggest dreames, and work many strange effects, which may seem Divine Revelations or Miracles, when they are nothing less, it is not safe to give easie credit to dreames, &amp;c. as Divine; Untill upon due triall there shall appear a direct tendance to the advancement of Gods glory, and a conformity unto the revealed will of God in his written Word. Moreover, so to observe our ordinary dreames, as to divine, or foretell of future contingents, or to forecast there-from good or ill luck (as we call it) in the successe of our affaires, is a damnable superstition. Lastly, there may yet be made a lawfull, yea and a very profitable use, even of our ordinary dreames; both in Physick and Divinity. Of our bodies first. For since that the predominancy of Choler, Blood, Flegme, and Melancholy; as also the differences of strength, and health, and diseases, and distempers, by diet, passion, or otherwise, cause impressions of different formes in the fancy: our dreames may help to discover both in time of health, our naturall constitution, complexion, and temperature; and in times of sicknesse, from the ranknesse and tyranny of which of the humors the malady springeth. Of our soules too. For since our dreames for the most part look the same way, which our freest thoughts incline, the observing of our ordinary dreames may bee of good use for us unto that discovery, which of these three is our master sinne (for unto one of the three every other sin is reduced) The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life. Dr Sanderson, but more at large in his sixt Sermon, ad populum, of Gods appearing to Abimelech, Gen. 6. 20.Till the King troubled with a dream, In vain did the Magicians] We commonly so call them, who use diabolicall arts, and have any compact or commerce with evill spirits.

The Word hath since been taken in an ill sense for Witches, or Conjurers, and had the like fate with Tyrant, Sophister, &amp;c. Vossius makes three sorts of art Magicke. Naturall, as when an Egge moves on a Table, because of Quick-silver put into it; or a Naile hangs in the aire, because a Load-stone is hid above and beneath it. Artificiall, when Archimedes burnt the Roman Ships with looking-glasses, and Archytas made a woodden Dove to fly. Dæmoniacall, when a man is carried a hundred miles in an houre; a Brazen head answers to any question, &amp;c. Which Magicke who exercise, commonly joyne therewith the naturall and artificiall, that they may be thought in all the rest to work by nature or art. Magicians call, In vain, what new fate should befall Among Heavens constellations] Theagenes foretold the Empire to Augustus. Thrasyllus shew'd what imminent danger himselfe was in from Tiberius, The Mathematicians banish'd Rome by Vitellius, foretold his death should bee before the Calends of October. Ascletarion accus'd for a Mathematician, and not denying it, boasted of what he had foreseen by his art: Domitian ask'd him if he could tell what his own end should be, and when he affirm'd that he should shortly be torn of Dogs, commanded him to be slain forthwith; and, to confute the vanity of his art, carefully put into the funerall fire: which done, it happen'd, by a sudden tempest the pile was cast downe, and his body halfe burnt, was devoured by Dogges. The Empire was likewise foretold to Ralph of Auspurgh, and the Popedome to Leo the tenth. But it is not so hard to answer these, as is supposed. For a thing is fore-known, either by commerce with the Devill, who by reason of his subtlety and experience is seldome deceived; and often, God permitting, brings to passe what he foretels: Or when Astrologers are familiar with great men, and knowing what they go about, boast that they foreknow many things by the Stars, which they have learned elsewhere: or lastly, when crafty men among many false speake something true by chance. For that they do not alwaies tell truth, is proved by innumerable examples; I will now only bring in that of Pope John. 21. a Philosopher, Astrologer, and Physitian, who having before his familiar friends promised himselfe long life, died the fourth moneth after.

Jonathan, a man an Interpreter of secrets; Josephus, a finder out of secrets. But the vulgar Latine differs from all these, which translates it the Saviour of the World: and that it so signified in the Egyptian language, Saint Hierome also saith in his Quæst. Hebraic. He was called also, saith he, the Saviour of the world, because hee delivered the Land from an imminent destruction by Famine.

Ram. Posterity not alwaies doth inherit The praises of their Ancestors high merit; But 'tis oft seen, that a degenerate race, With lust and falsehood doth the stock disgrace. Jud. O child, and of our blood a part, Which in thy youths fresh flower art, Wherein doth this poor comfort lie, Thou know'st not thine own misery.

And thou, like Lybian gold, ô hair, The pastime of the wanton air: What dire blow shall unto thee give Thy death, or if thou chance to live, What horrid dungeon shall thee hold? Or in what land shalt thou be sold, Far from us, and thy Father, where A servile yoak thy neck shall bear? Alas born unto better fates, Whose Ancestors were Princes mates. In thy gay coat thy Father thee Playing about no more shall see. Nor when at high noon the Suns heat Shall make us from our Flocks retreat, (Under a tree, or by a spring) Shalt thou in hast our dinner bring. And some perhaps (for spite doth raigne In every Country) will againe Accuse thee falsely, when that thee A stranger, poor, forlorn they see. Ram. To love him you do well, who is so nigh In bloud. Among men great diversity there is of manners] There is no Nation, which wholly useth the same Customes; yea there is often much difference in neighbouring Cities. But Right it selfe is equally expedient for all men, and profitable both to Greeks and Barbarians. Josephus Antiq. Hist. 16. Among men great diversity There is of manners, and in every land Are severall laws, as the Prince wil command, Or people make for publike benefit: This Law is every where] Right reason is a law which cannot lie, nor is it a corruptible law of this or that mortall man; or a dead law written in dead bookes, or pillars, but ingraven by an immortall nature in an immortall understanding. Philo.This law is every where, nor is it writ In Cedar tables, nor in Marble cut; Nor brasse, but In the heart God hath it put] When the Gentiles which have not the Law, doe by nature the things contained in the Law: these having not the Law are a Law unto themselves; Which shew the worke of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witnesse, and their thoughts in the meane while accusing or else excusing one another, Rom. 2. 14, 15. in the heart God hath it put.

Though our condition and your excellence Make me afraid unto so great a Prince To speak, yet I beseech you to suspend Your anger, and a gracious ear to lend Unto a poor distressed Syrian, But what for audience is enough, a man. When hither first the Famine did us drive, You did us aske, we answered, that alive We had a Father, but exceeding old; Who had above twice threescore winters told. And that besides us ten he had a boy, A little one, his comfort and his joy; As born in his old age, and of his mother The only issue left, his elder brother Whom the same wombe did bear is long since dead. This child to you that we should hither lead Him with your Princely favours to enrich, A strict command you did us give. To which It nothing could availe us to reply: Our Father, if the lad him leave, will die. You said, that we no more should have access Unto you, or behold your face, unless Our Brother came; which when the old man heard, His reverend face with ashes he besmear'd, And silent sate and wept. When all our food Began to fail us, and we fearfull stood Looking on one another at the nigh Approaching famine; Go, said he, and buy More corn for us in Ægypt. We contend, That you must be obey'd: if he not send Our youngest brother with us, but at home Him keep, we doubtless back should empty come. But sadly he: two children did my dear, My best beloved Rachel to me bear: The first of them whom I shall ne'r see more, A wild beast (so yee told me) did devoure. If now you take this other from my sight, And any mischiefe should upon him light, (As our fraile lives to many dangers still Exposed are) then think I pray what will Become of my gray hairs: with griefe and woe Consum'd I down into the grave shall go. Now I beseech you even for the sake Of this old man, (your self if I may make So bold, had once a father) and to save His life, which if he miss the Lad will have A speedy period, do not suffer it Among your glorious titles to be writ, Great Saviour of Ægypt: You did slay An old man. In my brothers stead, I pray, Take me. I can do better service. He A weak and tender child will rather be A burden to a house. I did become A surety for him to my Father, whom O let me never see, unless I keep My promise, lest he me accuse and weep, Till life dissolve, and when in earths dark vault I bury him, I bury there my fault. Jos. Not all which you have said, though something, I Beleeve. Who doth a matter hastily Determine, he unto repentance hies The ready way. I further will advise. Jud. If dead, ô happy Joseph then, that thou These miseries dost not feel with us now; If living, that God unto whom belongs Vengeance not unreveng'd doth see thy wrongs. Chorus. VVhere Ægypt when the Sun doth rise Looks on his beams Phænicia] A Countrey of Asia neer unto Judea, whose chiefe Cities were Tyre and Sidon. Josephus writes, that they first invented the Greek Letters; and Strabo, that they were famous for arts of navigation and war. That Phænix was the same with Esau or Edom, thus Vossius: The Erythræans are from ???????, red; Erythea, from ??????, rednesse. And the Erythræan sea tooke this name from King Erythras, as the Gentiles call him, who in the Scriptures is Esau, or Edom, that is, red. They dister only in language; therefore the Hebrew, Edoms, or Idumean sea, the Greeke ?????????, and the Latine Mare rubrum, or red sea. But if the Tyrians came from the Idumæan sea; the reason is not obscure, why they are called ????????. For ???????? and ????????? are the same. And ?????? the same with ???????, that is, red: And therefore the Latines of ???????? have made puniceus: as from ?????? Pænus, whence Punicus. But that the Tyrians came from the Idumæan sea, Pliny and Solinus say: Herodotus also, and Strabo, and Procopius. Phœnicia lies; Which, whether it more good or ill Hath done to mankind may be still A question. For inventions rare, Taauta] Perhaps I should say Taautas. I tooke it for the name of a Towne in Phænicia. But I finde in Vossius: That Taautus invented the art of writing, and was the first who left behind him Commentaries of things done: and was by the Ægyptians called Thoor, or rather Thoud, by the Alexandrians Thoth, by the Grecians Hermes, the same with Mercury. Taauta doth the praises bear. In twice twelve letters] The common opinion both of our men, and the Hebrews was, that Moses was the Author of the Hebrew letters, which is asserted by Eupolemus, Artapanus, and other prophane writers, who report that Moses was a wise man, and the Inventor of letters, which he delivered to the Jewes, from whom the neighbouring Phænicians receiv'd them, from the Phænicians the Græcians by Cadmus. Moreover, the same Artapanus believes that Moses gave the Ægyptians letters, and is that Mercury, whom wee find among all the Greek and Latine Writers to have taught that Nation letters. But if any aske, in what letters then the wisdome of the Egyptians was contained, wherein wee read that Moses was learned, perhaps hee will find, it was only wont to be delivered and taught by word of mouth, and preserv'd in the memory of the teachers and learners: and that the forms of letters, if there were any then, were images of living Creatures which they call'd Hieroglyphicks. Philo Judæus ascribes the Invention of Letters to Abraham: but they seeme to have been many yeeres before Abraham. For Josephus 1 Antiq. tels us, That by the sonnes of Seth the son of Adam were erected two pillars, one of stone, the other of brick, and that the Arts which they had invented, were written on them, of which that of stone remain'd in Syria even in his time.

The Crocodile is eighteen foot long. It is bred out of an egge no bigger then a goose egge. Nor is there any other Creature (as Pliny saith) which from a lesser beginning growes to a greater magnitude. Yea, as he adds afterwards, some thinke that this one Creature growes as long as it lives. p. 1034. The Crocodile hath an exceeding great force in the taile, with the stroke whereof it breakes the legges even of a strong foure-footed beast. Voss. out of Plin. The eye-teeth of a Crocodile drives away agues, if you fill them with frankincense (for they are hollow) so that the sicke party see not him in five daies who shall have bound them unto him. They say that the little stones taken out of her belly are good against the shaking fits of an ague. They are wont, as Herodotus in Euterpe hath it, to take Crocodiles in this manner. They put a hooke into a chine of Pork which the hunter casts into a River: Then standing on the banke, he beats a live Pig, whose cry the Crocodile hearing comes on apace, and lighting upon the chine of Pork devoures it with the hook; and is forthwith drawn upon the bank; and because so also he will bee troublesome enough, they fill his eyes with mud, that hee may not see what the hunter does. Voss. p 1134. Some say, that Crocodiles weep, because their teares are become a proverbe. But this is meant of feigned teares not true: nor is it cleare enough what truth there is under that fable of the feigned tears of a Crocodile. The Crocodile also is made to have speech by the Stoicks in their Sophisme which they call Crocodilites. But this is to bee put among Æsops Fables. For as Pliuy saith, This one terrestriall creature wants the use of a tongue. Idem. p 978. Crocodile, The same To death a new way showes] There is a Booke of Dicæarchus, concerning the destruction of men, who having collected all other causes, as deluge, pestilence, desolation, also sudden multiplying of wild beasts, by whose incursion he shews, that some people have been consumed, compares then, how many more men have been destroyed by the invasion of men, that is, by wars, or seditions, then by any other calamity. Cic. de offic l. 2. to death a new way shows In a frail Bark the sea which plows.

But Purple by Kings to be worne] The purple colour at this day is not from the liquor of the shell-fish call'd a Purple, but from herbs. In times past the water and fishes had this honour. Whence Saint Ambrose Hexam. l. 5. c. 2. What should I speake also of the Purples which furnish the tables and die the garments of Kings? What is adored in Kings, is from the water. Voss. l. 4. p. 1463. purple, by Kings to be worn, And the rich fingers to adorn; The The Emerald] Emeralds of all precious stones are most pleasing to the sight in regard nothing is greener which you can compare with them. They onely of all gemmes take up the eye and not satisfie it. Moreover, the sight wearied with being intentive upon other things is recreated by an Emerald.

Hence, Of right or wrong no difference Is made: no place, no persons are From rapine safe, nor will men spare The very Altars; but to meet With plunder any where is sweet. O happy the first Age] How well what the Poets have fabled of the golden Age, agrees with the state of man in Paradise! as I doubt not, but they had these things from tradition. Surely the first age of man in the Poets is the same with the first in the Scriptures: And Saturne the same with Adam. Voss. But what Poets write of the golden Age is not unknowne. Hear what an Orator saith of it and them. —That happy and as we call it golden Age was barren of Orators and crimes, but abounded with Poets and Prophets. Quintil.

For when the earth of grass was void, The Flocks and Herds by famine were destroy'd; And all which nature gives for food to men.

Sat. 15. make mention. Plin. l. 10. c. 28. saith: The Ægyptians invocate their Ibes against the approach of Serpents. The same cause of divine honour Herodotus gives in Euterpe, where also he describes them, and saith, It was a capitall crime among the Ægyptians for any one to kill an Ibis, or Hawke, whether knowingly, or ignorantly. Vos. l. 4. p 1274. The Ibis drinks not of foule water or infected with poyson, but pure and wholesome: and this is said to be the cause, why, as Ælian saith, l. 7. de animal. c. 45. the Priests in Ægypt sprinkle not themselves with any water, but with that which they believe the Ibis to have drank of. Voss. As Herodotus is Author, that other Nations had the use of a clyster from the Egyptians: So Galen acknowledgeth that the Egyptians learned it from the Ibis.

Asps] Infuse not (as some say) poyson with their taile, but, like other serpents, having made a wound with their saw-like teeth, they breath it thereinto out of small holes underneath, where in a little skin they keep it for those uses: Whence of Detractors, Psal. 140. The poyson of Aspes is under their lips. Cleopatra chose the biting of an Aspe, as an easier kind of death then to drinke poyson, or fall upon a sword. For it is so little the Aspe hurts, as it cannot be felt, not so much as the pricke of a needle be seen, which lessens the griefe, whereas the greater wounds are wont to have the greater pain. The pain is also lesse lasting, because of a poyson, Which in no Serpent is compacted more. Luc. l. 9. A most piercing poyson therefore, saith Ælian, and penetrating most swiftly; which is the cause, why, whereas it comes so speedily to the heart, it also hastens death.

But though the wound bee so little, there comes a little blood out, and that discolour'd, who are stricken live not above foure houres. Yet, such is the divine goodnesse, they are curable by drinking of vinegar; which was first found out by a Boy, who being bitten by an Aspe, and extreame thirsty, for want of water at hand dranke often of a vinegar bottle which he carried, and by that meanes recovered.

Annal. l. 1. There was one Percennius—Who after the better sort were gone to their lodgings, by little and little in secret conventicles in the night, or in the shutting of the evening gathered together, and stirred up the unexpertest of the Souldiers, and such as were most doubtfull what entertainment they should expect after the death of Augustus.

Whence the Greeks think the City took the name of ?????? or ?????, because ??????? signifies to cut. But others imagine the City hath the name from the Ægyptian word Copti, which signifies privation: because Isis when she lived there, was depriv'd of her husband. Of both which Plutarch.

Alive them bury in the Mines] We descend into the entrailes of the earth, we go down as far as to the seat and habitation of the infernall spirits, and all to meet with rich treasure, &amp;c. Plin. l. 33. in Proæm. I will not dispute it, whether all minerals were made at the first creation, or have since received increase by tract of time, which latter I confesse I rather with Quercetan incline unto, they being somewhat of the nature of stones, which undoubtedly grow, though not by augmentation or accretion, yet by assimilation or apposition, turning the neighbouring earth into their substance; Yet thus much may we confidently affirme, that the Minerals themselves wast not in the ordinary course, but by the insatiable desire of mankinde. Nay, such is the Divine Providence, that even there, where they are most vex'd and wrought upon, yet are they not worn out, nor wasted in the whole. Of late within these few yeers Mendip Hils yeelded, I think, more lead then ever; and at this day I do not hear that the Iron Mines in Sussex, or the Tin works in Cornwall are any whit abated; which I confesse to be some what strange, considering this little corner furnishes in a manner all the Christian world with that mettall.

Now what concerns my own estate, I'le to my faithfull wife (within) relate] Our Author makes Sophompane as a good and loving husband, and endued with virtues, not onely politicall but Oeconomicall.

To follow the strict rules of Law he sought, Unlesse where clemency perswaded ought To bate of rigour, yet not so unbent, As vice from thence should take encouragement: Jud. What should I say, that Sophompaneas Yesterday feasting us did each guest place According to our birth by nature. Sim. This, Beleeve me Brother, but the least thing is In him, which you so much seem to admire. Th'Almighty power of God doth him inspire, And what not any mortall mind can reach, A heavenly spirit doth, within, him teach] For he was most skilfull in prodigies, and the first that found out the interpretation of dreames, nor did any thing of divine or humane law seem unknown to him: in so much as that he foresaw a dearth many yeeres before, and all Ægypt had perished unlesse by his admonition the King had commanded corn to be laid up for many yeers, and his experiments were so great, as that his answers seem'd to be given not by a man, but from God.

This is no reall story. One who was A prisoner with Sophompaneas, Had such a dream, which he interpreted; That when the Sun had thrice his radiant head In Heaven advanced, the King would as before Him to his place of Cup-bearer restore. The event proves him a Prophet. But alas, How soon are benefits forgot!

As many other stalkes I see to lie Almost upon the ground, a withered, dry, Thin handfull, scorch'd with the Suns burning heat, And these the seven gallant ears up eat. What's he in skarlet lying sees this sight? Sim. The King. For unto him In dreames by night] Of divine dreames see Num. 12. 6. Joel 2. 28. Acts 2. 17. Examples thereof in the old Testament, the dreame of Abraham, Abimelech, Jacob, Laban, Joseph, Pharaoh, Solomon, Nabuchodonosor, Daniel, &amp;c. And in the New, of Joseph, the Magi, Pilates wife, Paul. Whereby is abundantly confuted the opinion of Aristotle, when he proves that no dreames are from God, because it would be absurd to send them, not to the best and wisest, but to the simpler sort: For that they were nor only sent to the simple and unskilfull, the examples alledg'd sufficiently teach. But Aristotle was deceiv'd, in that the dreames which the Gentiles boasted for divine, were for the most part of vulgar men. Indeed the Devill could more easily abuse the more simple and credulous. But the forenamed were almost a I men famous for wisdome and holinesse, yea many of them in high dignity. Whence also is refelled that he thought all divinations introduc'd by lawes to be the better observ'd by the people. Some defend Aristotle herein, in that God would rather teach men waking then sleeping, and in open words then in dreames for the most part obscure. But God would instruct us by more then one way. Besides therefore the ordinary manner wherein by reading or hearing his word he certifies us concerning heavenly Mysteries and his will; hee would also use another way, whereby he makes us partakers of his secrets even neither seeing nor hearing. Moreover, it is manifest that the minde of man is more fit in his sleep to receive heavenly things, because it is then void and free from earthly cares. And when he awakes &amp; ruminates on the dream, the darknesse and silence of the night breed a greater veneration towards Divine things. Surely the night is fit for the meditation of weighty matters. Yea this also addes to the veneration, that the dreames were not alwaies plaine: By which meanes men were withall stirr'd up to seek the understanding of them from God or godly men. So that this also was an argument of the Divine goodnesse, that sometimes he would send dreames even to Heathen Kings; but the interpretation whereof they should fetch not from Magicians but from holy men: as Pharaoh from Joseph, Nabuchodonosor from Daniel. For hereby God invited both the Kings and their wise men, yea all their subjects to an acknowledgment of the cœlestiall and true Deity, and to repentance from their sins, Voss. Idolol. l. 3. c. 35. in dreams by night Obscurely God seven fruitfull yeers foretold, And seven of famine.

I know him pictur'd in fine linnen, whom An Ivory chariot drawes, a diamond from His left hand sparkles, a gold chain hangs round About his neck, the people to the ground Bowing adore him, and his praises sing. But what are those there In a treble ring] Ægypt was divided into six severall sorts of people. The three first, which were Kings, Priests, and souldiers, govern'd the State and Common-wealth of Ægypt: The other three served in the Country to use things necessary for the Kingdom and state, which were Husbandmen, craftsmen, and shepherds. Diod. Sic. in a treble ring Divided and distinguish'd? The first are Close girt in coats: the next prepar'd for war, Sweat under armour: the third sort in sight Appear from head to foot arrai'd in white. Sim. The people of this Kingdom by the Ile Of Philæ bounded, and the sea and Nile He wisely hath divided in three parts, And distributing them to severall arts Had added new inventions. Behold where In the first rank the husbandmen appear; And they whose labours do sustain our lives, To lift the foaming flood up he contrives With the perpetuall motion of a wheel, Whose endlesse circlings footing never feel. Behold there others ?A strange sight to tread Meale with their feet, clay with their hands to knead.] I suppose Grotius meanes Bakers, and Bricke-makers, or Potters. And I finde in Joan. Aubanus (a German Geographer) who, I believe hath it out of Diodorus Siculus, That (among other strange customes) the Egyptians did use to make bread with their feet and clay with their hands. a strange sight) to tread Meal with their feet, clay with their hands to knead. The second sort are souldiers, whom in peace He hath train'd up to war: by some of these A trench is cast; others contend who most Swiftly can run in armes, and at a post Deal heaviest blows: some make a horse to bound, Curbing his tender mouth, and riding round Into a circle draw. But others strive A chariot arm'd with dreadfull hooks to drive. Some measure places out, wherein to pitch Their tents, them fencing with a bank &amp; ditch. With a huge quarter-staffe those armed go; These shoot an arrow from a twanging bow. These with a pole-axe in their hands to fight, Practice. See there whole troops, now to the right, Now to the left hand turning, now expos'd In a broad front, into a wedge now clos'd. The third sort to religion sequestred, From taxes free, by the Kings store are fed: And think not that they onely serve to put Sabæan odours on the Altars, but By Sophompaneas they are taught t'enquire What makes the wandering planets back retire. Why, when the Sun in Cancer is, the day Is longest: ?Whether the North Star doth stay Ever at the same distance fom the Pole.] The Poets fable that the seventh Star of the Pleiades by name Electra, after the Destruction of Troy would no more be seen: because Dardanus the founder of the Trojan Nation was born of Electra. And, that I may the more easily pardon the heathen poets, there have not been wanting in our age, who thought, that the Polar star hath in like manner hid it selfe after the taking of Constantinople; than which nothing is more vaine. For if you except a little one which lies between the Pole and Ursaminor, that very same in the taile of Ursaminor, as it was of old in the time of Hipparcus and Ptolomy, is also at this day most neere the Pole, and in like manner is called the Polar Starre. Voss. whether the North-star dothstay Ever at the same distance from the Pole: (the whole Why Heaven brings forth new starres] But, say they, if Heaven be either watery, or airy, or starres fiery; both are of an Elementall nature; and so liable to generation and corruption: which the experience of so many ages contradicts; seeing no alteration hitherto is made either in the magnitude or number or brightnesse of the stars. Which when they say they little thinke that they give judgement of a body so remote from our senses; where innumerable mutations may be, unto which the edge of our eyes cannot reach. For it is as if from Heaven wee should contemplate earth; whose magnitude and form would alwaies seem the same to us, however singulars are subject to corruption. Moreover, their opinion is cleerly refel'd by new stars which at divers times have appear'd in Heaven. As that mention'd by Pliny, l. 2. c. 26. Another in the time of Adrian the Emperor. Another under Otho 1. Another in the Yeere 1264. And what shall wee say to that in the Yeere 1572? Which to have truly been in the firmament, Clavius proves by a double argument: one, because it was seen by all men from most divers parts of Europe in the same place of Cassiopea: the other, that as long as it lasted (which was almost two yeeres) it constantly followed the motion not of one Planet, but of the fixt stars. Now that it was a new star, and never before seen, all the Mathematicians thought, except Annibal Raimund of Verona. Wherefore wee must conclude, that this new star was of cœlestiall matter, but not wrought so solidly, and unto perpetuity as others are wont, which because more compact, are so much more perfect, and not so dissoluble. And even at this day an empty space is there seen, where that star first appear'd. I dispute not whether it shin'd with its owne light, or the light of the Sun. It is enough, that the matter thereof was not carryed up thither from the earth. For how should it be elevated above the Sun it selfe? In what manner likewise could so grosse a matter exhale out of the globe of the earth, and that three hundred times bigger then the globe of the Earth and Water? For such was the magnitude of that star at the beginning; what shall I say of other stars afterwards in like manner, in the judgement of Mathematicians, bred in the skie? as of that in the yeere 1577, which appear'd seven weekes: of which another in 1600: another in 1604. And surely whether it were a star or a comet in the yeer 1618. all good Astrologers plac'd it in heaven. Voss. l. 2. c. 39.Why heaven brings forth new stars: and through Work of the world the divine counsels they Search out as far as nature beares a swey. See you those figures written in the dust] The old Ægyptians much exercised themselves in Geometry, Arithmeticke, Astronomy; Geometry they studied of necessity, because when the bounds of their fields were removed by the o'reflowing of Nilus, after the River was returned into it's channel, every one was to have their owne restor'd again: nor could the portion of grounds be otherwise assigned then by applying an art, which made up out of certaine principles, could not deceive skilfull measurers. And it was therefore called Geometry, as it were a measuring of the Earth. Now they gave themselves to Astronomy by reason of the commodity thereof, as who having alwaies cleare nights, and beholding the Region of Heaven far and wide, troubled with no clouds nor mists, could easily observe the rising and setting, the progresse and regresse of the stars, which was most pleasant to know and profitable for life, and worthy the exercise of mans wit: then also to these two Geometry and Astrology was added, that as it were subservient, and whose ministery these cannot bee without, the knowledge of numbers which is called Arithmeticke. Viv. in Aug. de Civ. Dei, l. 18. c. 39.See you those figures written in the dust? How great a surface a triangle must Contain, they dispute: what proportion there The Circle hath to the Diameter.

Some are reported to have been so high, as all did greatly admire how the cement could be carried up. They say that one of them was twenty yeers in building by 360000 men. That there was no other cause of building them, then a vain ostentation of the wealth of the Egyptian Kings: either lest the leaving money to their successors might be an occasion of treason against them, or that the people should not be idle. There were three between Memphis and Delta, whereof two are reckon'd the wonders of the World. The third is lesse, but cost more. The lower halfe is of that blacke stone whereof mortars are made. Under this some say, Rhodope is buried, one of whose shoos, whil'st she was washing, an Eagle took up, and let fall in the lap of an Egyptian King. Which hee admiring caus'd her to be sought out, and married her. And, when she was dead, built this Pyramis over her.

When the famine more Cruelly pinch'd, they then bring all their breed Of Oxen, and what other Cattell feed In the green pastures: then they morgage all Their Lands, and afterward themselves inthrall. So all those grounds which the great Nile doth see, Except what to the Priests allotted bee; And all the people by the King were bought, Whom to forsake (for this the Governour thought To be the Kingdomes safety) he commands, Where long their ancestors had dwelt, the Lands, And in strange places he new Colonies Hath planted. Iud. O how politique and wise His Counsels are! whether long use or Heaven Such wisdome from above to him hath given!

Nile or if Siris] Nilus is in the Scriptures cal'd by a double name: one common; the other more proper. The common appellation is the river of Ægypt, Gen. 15. 18. which in Hebrew is Nachal Mitzraim. Now for Nahal or Naal, the Syrians and Egyptians say Neel; as the Phænicians and others for Bahal or Baal, Beel; and as from Beel Bel, thence ?????, so from Neel Nel, whence ??????. The other name in the Scripture is Sichor, Isa. 23. 3. Jer. 2. 18. which signifies blacke. For Scachar is to be made blacke. Whence the old Latin word scurus, and with a præposition, obscurus. For the water of Nile is thicke and blackish, by reason of the mud it brings with it from the South parts. It makes also the land black in moistening it: as the haires of young men are blacke by reason of moisture, which afterwards through defect thereof grow hoary. And what if we say that Osiris is from Sihor or Sior? For Sior, the letters transpos'd, is Osir, whence, adding the Greeke and Latine termination, Osiris. And from Osiris they said Siris. For so the Ethiopians and Egyptians call Nilus. Voss. l. 2. c. 74. Nile, or if Siris rather we, Or, With our parents] The Ethiopians. By whom Nilus was also called Astapus, which, in their language, signifies water breaking out of darknesse, and which likewise on the left side where the streame fals is called Astabores, &amp; on the right side Astusabes, and not Nilus before they meet in one full River. Plin. l. 5. c. 9. with our parents better thee Astapus call, who from a spring Unknown through desarts wandring Deep under ground, where thou for men May'st usefull rise, break'st out agen, And from high rocks down falling mak'st An horrid murmur, and thence tak'st A double course, which gently glides Embracing Ægypt on both sides; Until far spreading with seven wide Channels it doth the sea divide. What shall I say—] Our Author I suppose alludes to a discourse after supper between Cæsar, and the old Ægyptian Priest Achoreus, concerning the originall of Nilus, in the last Booke of Lucan. Which may serve for a Comment upon this whole Chorus, and is worth your reading, but too long to bee transcrib'd hit her by me. See likewise Seneca l. 4. Natural. Quæst. c. 2. Farnab. in Lucan. l. 10.What shall I say a Virgin, when We hear so many learned men To differ, whom my Lord doth call Often to dine with him? what shall I say, the direfull causes be, That thou wont Ægypt formerly To water so, It had no need of raine from Heaven] Whosoever shall consider the benefits of Nilus, he will cease to wonder, that Water was by no Nations had in greater honour, then among the Egyptians. For without Nilus what would all Egypt be? Seeing its soile is nitrous, and parch'd with the Sunne, and almost as hard as any stone; in many places also gaping so, as that a Horse-man cannot travell; nor is this evill remedied by raine, which Ægypt knowes not, if you except Alexandria, and other places nigh the Sea. But Nilus is to the Egyptian soile in stead of raine from heaven: whereupon, not Ovid indeed, as L. Sineca l. 4. Nat. Quæst. c. 2. his memory slipping, relates; but his contemporary Tibullus hath sung: Thou art the cause, thy land doth beg no rain, Nor the dry grass for showres to Jove complaine. l 1. el. 7. Parmeno also of Byzantium hath it in Athæneus, O Nile the Ægyptian Jupiter. Wherefore it is by Philo, l. de profugis, said to be onely not a corrivall of Heaven. Yea Heliodorus in his ninth Booke saith expresly, that it is called by the Egyptians the corrivall of Heaven: and he addes the reason, because without raine it waters, and moistens as it were with a showre. This is the first benefit of Nilus. But it would bee a small thing, that a nitrous and barren soile should be water'd. By the Divine Providence therefore another benefit is, that when it ebbes, it leaves the grounds not only softned, but also mudded: as it is in Cic. 2. de Nat. Deor. And more fully thereof Seneca, l. 4. Quæst. Nat. c. 2. Nilus on a sandy and thirsty soile brings both water and earth. For whereas it flowes troubled and foule, it leaves all the dreggs in the dry and gaping places, and daubes up the chinkes with whatsoever fat is carried along with it: and is profitable to the grounds for two causes, both that it overflowes, and that it bemires them.

Yea it was prefer'd by the Egyptians before Hesperus, and called Isis, which with Osiris is their chiefe Deity. This star is so bright above other stars, as that if you lay a looking-glasse upon the water you may see it at noon day; yea, who are sharpe sighted may see it or thinke they see it, even without a glasse. Voss. l. 2. p. 498. The Dog-star is called Sirius from Siris; because of the great conspiracy between the Dog-starre and Nilus. For in the dog-daies Nilus doth most of all overflow; as that in like manner both the Dog in Heaven, and Nilus rageth in earth. Idem, p. 692. Thus often call, wilt higher flow?

The cause whereof are the perpetuall showrs nigh the Equinoctiall line: where it is Winter, when it is Summer with them, who dwell under the Tropicke of Cancer, and on this side of it. With these showers therefore rushing in heapes towards the North, all Ægypt is overflow'd, which because (happening in the midst of July, when the Sun enters into Leo) it was believ'd to be the benefit of the cœlestiall Lyon, among the Egyptians the Lyon was the Symbole of a floud: and they so made their Aquæducts, and Conduit-pipes, as that the waters were spouted out of the head of a Lyon gaping with open jawes. And from the Egyptian Architects the Greeks and Romans took up this fashion, from them and other Nations. As also it hath been deriv'd to us from the Egyptians, that upon the battlements of our houses, especially of our Churches, we put the heads and yawning mouths of Lyons, Vos. l. 2. p. 696.Her Rain into thy river poure?

Hence was the originall of the Fable of Saturn bound by Jupiter his sonne and cast into Hell. Heare we Lucian discoursing thereof, l. de Astrolog. Neither hath Jupiter bound Saturne, nor cast him into hell, or done such other things, as men suppose; but Saturne is carried in his externall motion at a vast distance from us, and his motion is slow and not easily seen by men. Wherefore they say, hee stands still, as it were bound. And that huge profundity of aire is called Hell.

These things I doubt o're-wisely yee In vain seek. God the world who made, Hath made Nile, &amp;c. Because it was a custome in Ægypt, that the measure of the rising of the river Nilus should be carried to the Temple of Serapis, as it were to the author of the inundation, and increase of the waters; when his image was cast down and burnt, it was generally said that Serapis mindfull of the injury would not make the waters flow beyond their wonted channell. But that God might shew it was not Serapis, who was much younger then Nilus, but that it was himselfe, who could command the waters of the River to increase in their seasons, there was so great an inundation from that time and afterwards, as no age could remember to have been formerly: and therefore the cubit it self, that is the measure of the water which they call Pechys, was from that time wont to bee carried into the Church to the Lord of the waters.

[taken from the piety of Storkes which requite their parents by feeding them in their old age] So that Solon is commended, because upon them who should not doe it he set a marke of infamy. But this is not so ordinary as for the parents to maintaine their children; for children, when they are born, bring nothing with them whereon to live. Besides, they have a longer time to live then their parents: and therefore as honour and obedience is due to the parents and not to the children; so maintenance is due more to the children then to the parents. And the Apostle saith, 2 Cor. 12. 14. The children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children, Grot. de jur. bell. ac pac. l. 2. c. 7. § 5. Yet the same Apostle saith, 1 Tim. 5. 4. Let them (the children or Nephews, I understand with Beza) learn first to shew piety at home and to requite their parents.

In the nature, for it is an eternall and spirituall, and intelligent essence; in qualities, for man was made after God in righteousnesse, and true holinesse [or holinesse of truth as Junius and the margent in our English Bible have it] Lastly in the attributes, for he obtaineth a dominion or principality in these inferiour things, as it were a certain image of the divine principality. See Eph. 4. 24. Col. 3. 10. in his own image, From whom mankind his linage Derives, in whom all wee Conclude our pedigree. Then six daies work he shut Up, and an end here put, God having man created, Nought greater meditated. For him of his free grace He gave a mind and face. Which Heaven might contemplate; Then long to propagate His seed, he from his side A rib took, a fair Bride Which to the man became, Whose heart felt a new flame, Assoon as he did wake, And sleep his limbes forsake] Adam should have slept, though he had never sinn'd. For albeit that sleep had not proceeded from a wearinesse of the exteriour senses, or the spirits serving them (for neither in that happy state would labour have had place) though also it had not been to repaire the spirits in part consum'd by the naturall heat (for neither would there have bin any losse or decay of strength) yet man had not wanted the pleasure of sleep; because the vapours from the aliment had then also gone up to the brain: the spirits too had bin more inwardly allur'd to a cessation: and thence againe invited to exteriour functions. I am further perswaded to this opinion (which the great Aquinas was of) by that sleep sent by God upon Adam. I know the Septuagint translate it ????????: and it is a sure argument of an extasy, that with the eyes of his mind he saw a rib taken from him, and Eve to be framed thence: so that being awake he forthwith brake out into these words; This now is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. But though it were an extasie, yet it might bee a sleep too; In his sleep surely Adams minde was divine elevated, so as it saw what was done by God. At this was confirm'd by the Hebrew word Tardema, which signifies a deep sleep. Voss. l. 3. c 34.And sleep his limbes forsake.

Vitellus being Consuls, after the revolution of many ages, the Bird Phænix came into Ægypt: and afforded matter of discourse upon that miracle to the most learned both of the inhabitants, and of the Greeks. What they agree in, and many things doubtfull, but not unworthy the knowledge, I have thought sit to set downe. That this creature is sacred to the Sunne, and differing foom others in the beake and feathers, all agree, who have describ'd her forme. Of the number of her yeeres the report is various. The most common is 500. some affirme 1461. And that the former birds, first in the reigne of Sesostris, afterward of Amasis, and then of Ptolomy the third of the Macedonian race, flew into the City called Heliopolis, a flock of other birds accompanying them and wondering at the new shape. But antiquity indeed is herein obscure. Between Ptolomy and Tiberius were lesse then 250 yeeres. Whence some thought this a false Phænix, and not to have come from Arabia, &amp;c. These things are uncertaine and fabulously augmented. But that this bird is sometime seen in Egypt is not to be doubted. Tac. Annal. l. 6. The Phænix is said to appeare against a great change in the world. And the Ægyptians paint this Bird, when they would expresse a vicissitude and restauration of things. Voss. l. 2. in Addend. the Phenix on Her wings of Cinnamon Which smell Of whose rare kind but one] What wise man can believe, there is a single Bird, which burnes her selfe in a fire, kindled both by the Sunne beames and the fanning of her owne wings; that from her turn'd into ashes, or at least from her marrow or blood is bred a worm, which afterwards having taken wings becomes this Bird, repair'd by her owne death, because she died that she might live, and so is made both the parent and issue: Whence and when fit for the burden, her first care is that (if she spring againe not out of the ashes but marrow or blood) shee carry her parents body to Heliopolis, and offer it upon the Altar of the Sun. To have related these things is to have confuted them. Yet that there is such a Bird hath been believ'd even by Tacitus: Yea Tertullian thought the Scriptures made mention of the Phænix. For in his Book de Resurrect. he hath rendred that in Psalm. 92. ??????? ?? ?????? ???????. The just shall flourish as a Phænix; whereas hee should have said, as a Palme tree. With the very like error, as another in Plutarch, which Muretus observes in Variis, L. 13. cap. 12. hath translated ????????? ????????, the braine of a Phænix, whereas it signifies the pith of a Palme tree. Surely that David meant a plant, is cleare, by that which there follows of the Cedar, and Plane tree. But indeed Clemens Romanus, a contemporary with the Apostles, makes mention of this Bird in his first Epistle to the Corinthians: Which a few yeeres since came forth into the light by the singular care of that famous man Patrick Young. Yet there are, who judge this Epistle to bee none of Clements, because by the nature of a Bird, which is no where, he seeks to illustrate those things, which belong to heavenly truth. But by what we have formerly said of Pliny and Tacitus, we plainly see that in those times wherein Clement liv'd, that opinion of the Phænix, was common. And this is enough in a writing, ecclesiasticall indeed, yet not appertaining to the Canon of faith, and life. For neither is it necessary that we believe, that Clement knew all things, which did concerne the secrets of nature. Nor are we bound to believe it of the Apostles; although Christ promised, John 16. 13. That he would send the Holy Ghost, who should lead them into all Truth. Surely this is to be restrain'd to the truth of those things, which appertaine to the businesse of salvation. Yea not indeed to all them, because the Apostles themselves, 1 Corinth. 13. 9. saw in part, and Prophesied in part: but of all, which it was needfull to know for the attaining another life. Voss.

Vos. Idolol. l. 2. p. 501. the neighbouring ram. Jos. So many honours and so great on me Your Majesty] Our Author hath Your goodnesse. The first part of divine worship is to believe that there are Gods. The next, to render unto them their Majesty, to render unto them their goodnesse, without which goodnesse there is no Majesty. Seneca Epist. 99. And Junius in his Notes upon Exod. 33. 18, 19. (where Moses doth beseech the Lord to shew him his glory, and is answered: I will make all my goodnesse passe before thee, &amp;c.) observes, that the goodnesse of God is his glory.Your Majesty hath heap'd, as I would be Rather eas'd of the burthen, then it have Made heavier. Yet why I something crave, My Brethren are the cause, and hither whom With them I would have out of Syria come My Father. They by occupation are Shepherds. A pleasant Land there lies not far From Heliopolis] Which signifies the City of the Sunne. It is the same, which is called On in the Scriptures, Gen. 41. 45. Vossius. See the Note upon Asenath, in the first Chorus. Heliopolis, where grasse still green, And pastures ever flourishing are seen. The bordering Pelusians it call Goshen. This Land hath hitherto been all Lost to the use of men, ?Because your Nation Holds every Shepherd an abomination. Gen. 43. 32. The cause is not there express'd, but by comparing that Text with Gen 46. 34. and Exod. 8. 26. it appeares that the Egyptians did abhor a Shepherds life, and them who fed upon Oxen, or other cattle; or did sacrifice those creatures which they worshipped for Gods. Jun. &amp; Tremell. because your Nation Holds every Shepherd an abomination. These grounds if on my kindred you bestow, I promise it shall to the profit grow Of them and Ægypt. See, in words what I, They by their gestures beg, and prostrate lie. Jud. Long may the Mighty Pharian Monarch live. Phar. Rise up: I for your flocks will pastures give; And, your whole house and Father to convey, VVaggons, and fit provision for the way: And the best things which fruitfull Ægypt can Afford, a present for the good old man. Ios. Give me leave that I may this adde. You see Under your government a people free Come voluntarily. O then let none To change their Rites and their Religion Ever compell them. If they have a minde Hence to depart, either because they finde, That some calamity will them befall, Or because better hopes away them call, Let none forbid them. May pure air so blesse Ægypt, and Nilus keep a just increase; And mothers with a numerous issue fill The Land, and your race sway the scepter still. Phar. By him, who all things can o're-rule, I sweare, And this my head, &amp;c.] Moreover it was an ancient custome to sweare by naming other things and persons [besides God] whether they did imprecate that they should be hurtfull to them [for perjury] as the Sun, the Earth, Heaven, the Prince; or whether they desir'd to be punish'd in them, as in their head, their children, their country, their Prince. Neither was this the custome only of prophane Nations, but also of the Jews, as Philo teacheth us. For hee saith, that wee ought not, when we would swear, to run for every thing presently, to the Creator and Father of the Universe; but to sweare by our Parents, Heaven, Earth, the World. The like whereunto is noted by the Interpreters of Homer, that the ancient Greeks did not lightly swear by the Gods, but by other things at hand, as by their Scepter: and that this was ordain'd by the most just King Radamanth is deliver'd by Porphyry, and the Scholiast upon Aristophanes. So Joseph is read to have sworne by the life of Pharaoh, Gen. 42. 15. from a custome receiv'd among the Egyptians, which Aben Ezra there notes, Elizæus by the life of Elias, 2 Kin. 2. 2. Neither doth Christ, Mat. 5. as some think, meane that these oathes are lesse lawfull then what are made by the expresse name of God: but whereas the Hebrews did lesse regard them, through a certaine opinion not unlike his, who said, He thought his Scepter not to be the Gods, hee sheweth that even these are true oaths. For also Ulpian hath said very well: He who sweares by his owne life, seemes to sweare by God, for he swears with a respect of the Divine Deity. So Christ shews, that hee who sweares by the Temple, sweareth by God that dwelleth in the Temple, and hee that sweareth by Heaven, by God, who sitteth thereon, as his throne. But the Hebrew Doctors of those times thought, that men were not bound by oaths made by things created, unlesse, &amp;c.—Grat. de jur. bell. ac pac. l. 2. c. 13. De Jurejurando.And this my head and successors I here For ever bind; that their Religion free To th'Hebrews, their departure safe shall bee. If any King hereafter break this oath, May foaming Nilus with a bloody froath Colour the Ocean, loathsome Frogs the ground Cover, and in the bed-chambers abound. A raging Murrain on the cattell light, No herbs look green, the corn a tempest smite. Nor fruit nor leaves on any tree remain, With torrid ulcers vext may men complaine. Thick darknesse, such as in th'infernall shade Is to be felt, the face of heaven invade. Night follow night without a glimpse of day, Through every house the pestilence display, A sad infection, and the first-born kill, Which may with woefull cries the City fill. If this be not enough, in the profound Red sea may the whole Nation be drown'd. Jos. Nor shall it be rich Pharian soil, in vain, That thou the Hebrews e're didst entertain. Whil'st to a race belov'd of God, thou kind Shalt prove, all things to prosper thou shalt find Above thy wish. Nature her self shall bee Thy handmaid. There will come an age with thee When of our Nation famous Kings shall make A League, and Israel a wife shall take from Ægypt.] That is, Solomon shall marry Pharaohs daughter. Israel a wife shall take From Ægypt. Again some of th'Hebrew Nation Shall hither come and make A new plantation] And all the people both small and great, and the Captaines of the Armies arose, and came to Ægypt, 2 Kin. 25, 26. a new plantation. Afterwards, when descending from the skies He foretold by so many Prophesies, The Worlds Redeemer, Prince of piety, Shall visit mortals, he shall hither fly. A faithfull place of refuge this shall be, And Safe to him an infant exile] Our author in his Christus Patiens. These armes about my neck have hung, Coucht on the flowry banks of Nile; Ægypt, so just to thy exile, Hath now redeem'd her former curse: Our Jews then those of Memphis worse. G. Sandys. safe to him an infant exile. Hee The same Lawes both unto my Country-men The Hebrews, and unto th'Egyptians then Shall give, and Nile and Iordan teach in one Channell to meet of Pure Religion] Give me leave to remember a few verses not impertinent, out of that Divine Poet Mr George Herbert in his Church Militant. To Egypt first she came, where they did prove Wonders of anger once, but now of love. The ten Commandements there did flourish more Then the ten bitter plagues had done before. Holy Macarius and great Antony, Made Pharaoh Moses changing th'History. Goshen was darknesse, Egypt full of lights, Nilus for monsters brought forth Israelites. Such power hath mighty Baptisme to produce, For things mishapen things of highest use. pure Religion. Chorus. Partakers of so great a good] The King of Ethiopia (said by Geographers to bee one of the greatest Monarchs in the world) is commonly called Prester John, and in the Ethiopick Language Negush Chavvariavvi, which (saith Jos. Scaliger l. 7. de emendat. temp.) doth signifie, The Apostolike Emperor, or the Christian King. It is very probable, the Gospel was early planted there, even (as histories report also) by that honourable person the Eunuch, of so great authority under Q. Candace, and her Treasurer, who was baptized by the Apostle Philip. Act. 8. 38 Of Ethiopia likewise, Du Bartas by Sylvester. And scalding quick-sands of those thirsty Plaines, Where Jesus name yet in some reverence reignes; Where Prester John (though part he Judaize) Doth in some sort devoutly Chistianize.
