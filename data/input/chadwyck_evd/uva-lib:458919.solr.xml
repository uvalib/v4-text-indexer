      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter a Merchant, and Herman. Mer. Is he then taken? Her. And brought back even now sir. Mer. He was not in disgrace? Her. No man more lov'd, Nor more deserv'd it, being the onely man. That durst be honest in this Court. Mer. Indeed We have heard abroad sir, that the State hath suffered, A great change, since the countesse death. Her. It hath sir. Mer. My five yeares absence, hath kept me a stranger So much to all the occurrents of my Country, As you shall bind me for some short relation To make me understand the present times. Her. I must begin then with a war was made And seven yeares with all cruelty continued Upon our Flanders by the Duke of Brabant, The cause grew thus: during our Earles minority, Woolfort, (who now usurps) was employed thither To treat about a match betweene our Earle And the daughter and Heire of Brabant: during which treaty The Brabander pretends, this daughter was Stolne from his Court, by practice of our State, Though we are all confirm'd, 'twas a sought quarrell To lay an unjust gripe upon this Earledome, It being here beleev'd the Duke of Brabant Had no such losse. This war upon't proclaim'd, Our Earle, being then a Child, although his Father Good Gerrard liv'd, yet in respect he was Chosen by the Countesse favour, for her Husband And but a Gentleman, and Floriz holding His right unto this Country from his Mother, The State thought fit in this defensive war, Woolfort being then the only man of marke, To make him Generall. Mer. Which place we have heard He did discharge with honour. Her. I, so long, And with so blest successes, that the Brabander Was forc't (his treasures wasted, and the choyce Of his best men of Armes tyr'd, or cut off) To leave the field, and sound a base retreat Back to his Countrey: but so broken both In minde and meanes, er'e to make head againe, That hitherto he fitts downe by his losse, Not daring, or for honour, or revenge Againe to tempt his fortune. But this Victory More broke our State, and made a deeper hurt In Flanders, then the greatest overthrow She ever receiv'd: For Woolfort, now beholding Himselfe, and actions in the flattering glasse Of selfe-deservings, and that cherish't by The strong assurance of his power, for then All Captaines of the Army, were his creatures, The common Souldier too at his devotion, Made so by full indulgence to their rapines And secret bounties, this strength too well knowne And what it could effect, soone put in practice, As furtherd by the child-hood of the Earle And their improvidence, that might have peirc't The heart of his designes, gave him occasion To sieze the whole, and in that plight you find it. Mer. Sir, I receive the knowledge of thus much As a choyce favour from you. Her. Onely I must add Bruges holds out. Mer. Whether sir, I am going For there last night I had a ship put in, And my horse waits me. Exit. Her. I wish you a good journey. Enter Woolfort, Hubert. Wool. What? Hubert stealing from me? who disarm'd him, It was more then I commanded; take your sword, I am best guarded with it in your hand, I have seene you use it nobly. Hub. And will turne it On mine owne bosom, ere it shall be drawne Vnworthily or rudely. Wool. VVould you leave me VVithout a farwell Hubert? fly a friend Vnwearied in his study to advance you? VVhat have I ev'r possessed which was not yours? Or either did not court you to command it? Who ever yet arriv'd to any grace, Reward or trust from me, but his approaches Were by your faire reports of him prefer'd? And what is more I made my selfe your Servant, In making you the Master of those secrets Which not the rack of conscience could draw from me, Nor I, when I askt mercy, trust my prayers with; Yet after these assurances of love, These tyes and bonds of freindship, to forsake me, Forsake me as an enemie? come you must Give me a reason. Hub. Sir, and so I will, If I may do't in privat: and you heare it. Wool. All leave the roome: you have your will, set downe And use the liberty of our first friendship. Hub. Friendship? when you prov'd Traitor first, that vanish'd Nor do I owe you any thought, but hate, I know my flight hath forfeited my head; And so I may make you first understand What a strange monster you have made your selfe, I welcome it. Wool. To me this is strange language. Hub. To you? why what are you? Wool. Your Prince and Master, The Earle of Flaunders. Hub. By a proper title, Rais'd to it by cunning circumvention, force, Blood, and proscriptions. Wool. And in all this wisedome; Had I not reason? when by Gerrards plotts I should haue first been call'd to a strict accopt How, and which way I had consum'd that masse Of money, as they terme it in the warr, VVho underhand, had by his Ministers Detracted my great action, made my faith And loyalty so suspected in which failing He sought my life by practice. Hub. With what fore-head, Do you speake this to me? who (as I know't) Must, and will say 'tis false, Wool. My guard there. Hub. Sir, you bad me sit, &amp; promis'd you would heare Which I now say you shall, not a sound more, For I that am contemner of mine owne, Am Master of your life; then heer's a Sword Betweene you, and all aydes Sir, though you blind The credulous beast, the multitude, you passe not These grosse untruthes on me. Wool. How? grosse untruthes. Hub. I, and it is favourable language, They had bin in a meane man lyes, and foule ones. Wool. You take strange licence. Hub. Yes, were not those rumours Of being called unto your answers, spread By your owne followers; and weake Gerrard wrought (But by your cunnig practise) to be beleeve That you were dangerous; yet not to be Punish'd by any formall course of law, But first to be made sure, and have your crimes Layd open after, which your queint traine taking You fled unto the Campe, and there crav'd humbly Protection for your innocent life, and that, Since you had scap'd the fury of the warr, You might not fall by treason, and for proofe, You did not for your owne ends make this danger; Some that had been before, by you subornd, Came forth and tooke their oathes they had been hir'd By Gerrard to your murther. This once heard, And easily beleev'd, th'inraged Souldier Seeing no further then the outward man, Snatch'd hastily his Armes, ran to the Court, Kill'd all that made resistance, cut in pieces Such as were Servants, or thought friends to Gerrard, Vowing the like to him. Wool. Will you yet end? Hub. Which he foreseeing, with his Sonne, the Earle, Forsooke the Citty, and by secret wayes As you give out, and we would gladly have it, Escap'd their fury: though 'tis more then fear'd They fell among the rest; Nor stand you there To let us onely mourne, the impious meanes By which you got it, but your cruelties since So far: transcend your former bloody ills, As if compar'd, they onely would appeare Essayes of mischiefe; do not stop your eares, More are behind yet. Wool. O repeat them not, 'Tis hell to heare them nam'd. Hub. You should have thought, That hell would be your punishment when you did them, A Prince, in nothing but your princely lusts, And boundlesse rapines. Wool. No more I beseech you. Hub. Who was the Lord of house or land, that stood Within the prospect of your covetous eye? Wool. You are in this to me a greater Tyrant, Then ere I was to any. Hub. I end thus The generall griefe, now to my private wrong; The losse of Gerrards daughter Jaqueline: The hop'd for partner of my lawfull bed, Your cruelty hath frighted from mine armes; And her, I now was wandring to recouer. Thinke you that I had reason now to leave you, When you are growne so justly odious, That ev'n my stay here with your grace and favour, Makes my life ircksome? here surely take it, And do me but this fruite of all your frendship, That I may dye by you, and not your hang-man. Wool. Oh Hubert, these your wordes and reasons have As well drawne drops of blood from my griev'd hart, As these teares from mine eyes; Despise them not By all that's sacred, I am serious Hubert, You now have made me sensible, what furyes, Whips, hangmen, and tormentors a bad man Do's ever beare about him: let the good That you this day have done, be ever numberd, The first of your best actions; Can you think, Where Floriz is or Gerrard, or your love, Or any else, or all that are proscrib'd? I will resigne, what I usurpe, or have Unjustly forc'd; the dayes I have to live Are too too few to make them satisfaction With any penitence: yet I vow to practise All of a man. Hub. O that your hart and tongue Did not now differ! Wool. By my griefes they do not Nake the good paines to search them out; 'tis worth it, You have made cleane a Leper: trust me you have, And made me once more fit for the society, I hope of good men. Hub. Sir, do not abuse My aptnesse to beleeve. Wool. Suspect not you A faith that's built upon so true a sorrow, Make your owne safetyes: aske them all the ties Humanity can give, Hemskirick too shall Along with you to this so wish'd discovery, And in my name profess all that you promise; And I will give you this helpe to't: I have Of late receiv'd certaine intelligence, That some of them are in or about Bruges To be found out: which I did then interpret, The cause of that Townes standing out against me; But now am glad, it may direct your purpose Of giving them their safety, and mee peace. Hub. Be constant to your goodnesse, &amp; you have it. Exit. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter 3. Marchants. 1. Mer. T'is much that you deliver of this Goswin. 2. Mer. But short of what I could, yet have the Country Confirmd it true, and by a generall oath, And not a man hazard his credit in it: He beares himselfe with such a confidence As if he were the Master of the Sea, And not a winde upon the Sailers compasse, But from one part or other, was his factor, To bring him in the best commodities, Merchant e're venturd for: 1. 'Tis strange, 2. And yet; This do's in him deserve the least of wonder, Compared with other his peculiar fashions, Which all admire: he's young, and rich, at least Thus far reputed so, that since he liv'd In Bruges, there was never brought to harbour So rich a Bottome, but his bill would passe Unquestion'd for her lading. 3 Mer. Yet he still Continues a good man. 2 Mer. So good, that but To doubt him, would be held an injury Or rather malice, with the best that traffique; But this is nothing, a great stocke, and fortune, Crowning his judgement in his undertakings May keep him upright that way: But that wealth Should want the power to make him dote on it, Or youth teach him to wrong it, best commends His constant temper; for his outward habit 'Tis sutable to his present course of life: His table furnish'd well, but not with dainties That please the appetite only for their rarenesse, Or the deare price: nor given to wine or women, Beyond his health, or warrant of a man, I meane a good one: and so loves his state He will not hazard it at play; nor lend Upon the assurance of a well-pen'd Letter, Although a challenge second the denyall From such as make th'opinion of their valour Their meanes of feeding. 1 Mer. These are wayes to thrive, And the meanes not curs'd. 2 Mer. What follows this, Makes many Venturers with him, in their wishes, For his prosperity: for when desert Or reason leads him to be liberall, His noble mind and ready hand contend Which can add most to his free curtesies, Or in their worth, or speed to make them so. Is there a Virgin of good fame wants dowre? He is a father to her; or a Souldier That in his Countreyes service, from the warre Hath brought him only scars, and want? his house Receives him, and relieves him, with that care As if what he possess'd had been laid up For such good uses, and he steward of it. But I should loose my selfe to speake him further And stale in my relation, the much good You may be witnesse of, if your remove From Brugis, be not speedy. 1 Mer. This report I do assure you will not hasten it, Nor would I wish a better man to deale with For what I am to part with. 3 Mer. Never doubt it, He is your man and ours, only I wish His too much forwardnesse to embrace all bargains Sucke him not in the end. 2 Mer. Have better hopes, For my part I am confident; here he comes. Enter Florez &amp; the fourth Merchant. Flor. I take it at your own rates: your wine of Cyprus, But for your Candy sugars, they have met With such foule weather, and are priz'd so high I cannot save in them. 4 Mer. I am unwilling To seeke another Chap-man: make me offer Of something near my price, that may assure me You can deale for them. Flor. I both can, and will, But not with too much losse; your bill of lading Speakes of two hundred chests, valued by you At thirty thousand gilders. I will have them At twenty eight; so, in the payment of Three thousand sterling, you fall only in Two hundred pound. 4 Mar. You know, they are so cheape.â Flo. Why looke you; I'le deale fairly, ther's in prison, And at your suite, a Pirat, but unable To make you satisfaction, and past hope To live a weeke, if you should prosecute What you can prove against him: set him free, And you shall have your money to a Stiver, And present payment. 4 Mar. This is above wonder, A Merchant of your ranke, that have at Sea So many Bottoms in the danger of These water-Theeves, should be a meanes to save 'em It more importing you for your owne safety To be at charge to scoure the Sea of them Then stay the sword of Justice, that is ready To fall on one so conscious of his guilt That he dares not deny it. Flo. You mistake me, If you thinke I would cherish in this Captaine The wrong he did to you, or any man; I was lately with him, (having first, from others True testimony been assured, a man Of more desert never put from the shore) I read his letters of Mart from this State granted For the recovery of such losses, as He had receiv'd in Spain, 'twas that he aim'd at, Not at three tuns of wine, bisket, or beefe, Which his necessity made him take from you. If he had pillag'd you neare, or sunke your ship, Or thrown your men o'r-boord, then he deserv'd The Lawes extreamest rigour: But since want Of what he could not live without, compel'd him To that he did (which yet our State calls death) I pitty his misfortune; and to worke you To some compassion of them, I come up To your own price: save him, the goods are mine; If not, seeke else-where, I'le not deale for them. 4 Mar. Well Sir, for your love, I will once be lead To change my purpose. Flo. For your profit rather. 4 Mar. I'le presently make meanes for his discharge, Till when, I leave you. 2 Mar. What do you thinke of this? 1 Mar. As of a deed of noble pitty: guided By a strong judgement. 2 Mar. Save your Master Goswin. Flo. Good day to all. 2 Mar. We bring you the refusall Of more Commodities. Flo. Are you the owners Of the ship that lastnight put into the Harbour? 1 Mar. Both of the Ship, and lading. Flo. What's the fraught? 1 Mar. Indico, Quitchineel, choice Chyna stuffs. 3 Mar. And cloath of Gold brought from Camball. Flo. Rich lading, For which I were your Chapman, but I am Already out of cash. 1 Mar. I'le give you day For the molety of all. Flo. How long? 3 Mer. Sixe moneths. Flo. 'Tis a faire offer: which (if we agree About the prizes) I, with thanks accept of, And will make present payment of the rest; Some two hours hence I'le come aboord. 1 Mer. The Gunner shall speake you welcome. Flo. I'le not faile, 3 Mer. Good morrow. Exit Merch. Flo. Heaven grant my Ships a safe returne, before The day of this great payment: as they are Expected three moneths sooner: and my credite Stands good with all the world. Enter Gerrard. Ger. Blesse my good Master, The prayers of your poor Beads-man ever shall Be sent up for you. Flo. God 'a mercy Clause, Ther's something to put thee in minde hereafter To thinke of me. Ger. May he that gave it you Reward you for it, with encrease, good Master. Flo. I thrive the better for thy prayers. Ger. I hope so. This three yeares have I fed upon your bounties, And by the fire of your blest charity warm'd me, And yet, good Master, pardon me, that must, Though I have now receiv'd your almes, presume To make one sute more to you. Flo. What is't Clause? Ger. Yet do not think me impudent I beseech you, Since hitherto your charity hath prevented My begging your reliefe, 'tis not for money Nor cloaths (good Master) but your good word for me. Flo. That thou shalt have, Clause, for I think thee honest. Ger. To morrow then (dear Mr.) take the trouble Of walking early unto Beggars Bush, And as you see me, among others (Brethren In my affliction) when you are demanded Which you like best among us, point out me, And then passe by, as if you knew me not. Flo. But what will that advantage thee? Ger. O much Sir, 'Twill give me the preheminence of the rest, Make me a King among 'em, and protect me, From all abuse, such as are stronger, might Offer my age; Sir, at your better leizure I will informe you further of the good It may do to me. Flo. 'Troth thou mak'st me wonder; Have you a King and Common-wealth among you? Ger. We have, &amp; there are States are governd worse. Flo. Ambition among Beggars? Ger. Many great ones Wou'd part with halfe their States, to have the place, And credit to beg in the first file, Master: But shall be so much bound to your furtherance In my Petition? Flo. That thou shalt not misse of, Nor any worldly care make me forget it, I will be early there. Ger. Heaven blesse my Master. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. ScÃ¦na Prima Enter Higgen, Ferret, Prig, Clause, Jaculine, Snap, Gynkes, and other Beggars. Hig. Come Princes of the ragged regiment, You o' the blood, Prig my most upright Lord, And these (what name or title, e're they beare) Jarkman, or Patrico, Cranke, or Clapperdudgeon. Frater, or Abram-man; I speake to all That stand in faire Election for the title Of King of Beggars, with the command adjoyning, Higgen, your Orator, in this Inter-regnum, That whilom was your Dommerer, doth beseech you All to stand faire, and put your selves in ranke, That the first Commer, may at his first view Make a free choise, to say up the question. Fer., Pr. 'Tis done Lord Higgen. Hig. Thankes to Prince Prig, Prince Ferret. Fer. Well, pray my Masters all, Ferret be chosen Ye'ar like to have a mercifull mild Prince of me. Prig. A very tyrant, I, an arrant tyrant. If e're I come to reigne; therefore looke to't, Except you do provide me hum enough And Lour to bouze with: I must have my Capons And Turkeys brought me in, with my green Geese, And Ducklings i'th season: fine fat chickens, Or if you chance where an eye of tame Phesants Or Partridges are kept, see they be mine, Or straight I seize on all your priviledge, Places, revenues, offices, as forfeit, Call in your crutches, wooden legs, false bellyes, Forc'd eyes and teeth, with your dead arms; not leave you A durty clout to beg with o' your heads, Or an old rag with Butter, Frankinsence, Brimstone and Rozen, birdlime, blood, and creame, To make you an old sore; not so much sope As you may fome with i'th Falling-sicknesse; The very bag you beare, and the brown dish Shall be escheated. All your daintiest dells too I will deflowr, and take your dearest Doxyes From your warme sides; and then some one cold night I'le watch you what olde barne you goe to roost in, And there I'le smoother you all i'th musty hay. Hig. This is tyrant-like indeed: But what would Ginks Or Clause be here, if either of them should raigne? Ger. Best aske an asse, if he were made a Camell, What he would be; or a dog, and he were a Lyon. Ginks. I care not what you are, Sirs, I shall be A Begger, still, I am sure, find my selfe there. Enter Florez. Snap. O here a Judge comes. Hig. Cry, a Judge, a Judge. Flo. What aile you Sirs? what means this out-cry? Hig. Master A sort of poor soules met: Gods fools, good Master, Have had some little variance amongst our selves Who should be honestest of us; and which lives Uprightest in his call: Now, 'cause we thought We ne're should gree on't our selves, because Indeed 'tis hard to say: we all dissolv'd, to put it To whom that should come next, and that's your Mastership, Who, I hope, will termine it as your mind serves you, Right, and no otherwise we aske it: which? Which does your Worship thinke is he? sweet Master Looke over us all, and tell us; we are seven of us, Like to the seven wise Masters, or the Planets. Flo. I should judge this the man with the grave beard, And if he be notâ Ger. Blesse you, good Master, blesse you. Flo. I would he were: there's something too, amongst you To keep you all honest. Exit Snap. King of heaven goe with you. Omn. Now good reward him, May he never want it, to comfort still the poor, in a good houre. Fer. What is't? see: Snap ha's got it. Snap. A good crown, marry: Prig. A crown of gold. Fer. For our new King: good luck. Ginks. To the common treasury with it; if 't be gold, Thither it must. Prig. Spoke like a Patriot, Ferretâ King Clause. I bid God save thee first, first, Clause, After this golden token of a crowne; Wher's Oratour Higgen with his gratuling speech now, In all our names? Fer. Here he is pumping for it. Gin. H' has cough'd the second time, 'tis but once more And then it comes. Fer. So, out with all: expect nowâ Hig. That thou art chosen, venerable Clause, Our King and Soveraign; Monarch o'th Maunders. Thus we throw up our Nab-cheats, first for joy, And then our filches; last, we clap our fambles, Three subject signes, we do it without envy: For who is he here did not wish thee chosen Now thou art chosen? aske 'em: all will say so, Nay swear't: 'tis for the King, but let that passe; When last in conference at the bouzing ken This other day we sate about our dead Prince Of famous memory: (rest, goe with his rags:) And that I saw thee at the tables end, Rise mov'd, and gravely leaning on one Crutch, Lift the other like a Scepter at my head, I then presag'd thou shortly wouldst be King And now thou art so: but what need presage, To us, that might have read it, in thy beard, As well, as he that chose thee? by that beard Thou wert found out, and mark'd for Soveraignty. O happy beard! but happier Prince, whose beard, Was so remark'd, as marked out our Prince, Not bating us a haire. Long may it grow, And thick, and faire, that who lives under it, May live as safe, as under Beggars Bush, Of which this is the thing, that but the type. Om. Excellent, excellent oratour, forward good Higgen Give him leave to spit: the fine, well-spoken Higgen. Hig. This is the beard, the bush, or bushy-beard, Under whose gold and silver raigne 'twas said So many ages since, we all should smile On impositions, taxes, grievances, Knots in a State, and whips unto a Subject, Lye lurking in this Beard, but all hem'd out: If now, the Beard be such, what is the Prince That owes the Beard? a Father; no, a Grandfather; Nay the great Grand-father of you his people. He will not force away your hens, your bacon, When you have ventur'd hard for't, nor take from you The fattest of your puddings: under him Each man shall eate his own stolne eggs, and butter, In his owne shade, or sun-shine, and enjoy His owne deare Dell, Doxy, or Mort, at night In his own straw, with his owne shirt, or sheet, That he hath filch'd that day, I, and possesse What he can purchase, backe, or belly-cheats To his own prop: he will have no purveyers For Pigs, and poultry. Ger. That we must have, my learned Oratour, It is our will, and every man to keep In his own path and circuite. Hig. Do you heare? You must hereafter maund on your own pads he saies. Ger. And what they get there, is their owne, besides To give good words. Hig. Do you marke? to cut bene whids, That is the second Law. Ger. And keepe a-foote The humble, and the common phrase of begging, Lest men discover us. Hig. Yes; and cry sometimes, To move compassion: Sir, there is a table, That doth command all these things, and enjoyns 'em; Be perfect in their crutches: their fain'd planters, And their true pas-ports, with the ways to stammer, And to be dumb, and deafe, and blind, and lame, There, all the halting paces are set downe, I'th learned language. Ger. Thither I refer them, Those, you at leisure shall interpret to them, We love no heapes of lawes, where few will serve. Om. O gracious Prince, 'save, 'save the good K. Clause. Hig. A Song to crowne him. Fer. Set a Centinell out first. Sn. The word? Hig. A Cove comes, and fumbumbis to it.â Strike. The SONG. Cast our Caps and cares away: this is Beggars Holli-day, At the Crowning of our King, thus we ever dance &amp; sing. In the world looke out and see: where so happy a Prince as be? Where the Nation live so free, and so merry as do we? Be it peace, or be it war, here at liberty we are, And enjoy our ease and rest; To the field we are not prest; Nor are called into the Towne, to be troubled with the Gowne. Hang all Offices we cry, and the Magistrate too, by; When the Subsidies encreast, we are not a penny ceast. Nor will any goe to law, with the Beggar for a straw. All which happinesse be brags, he doth owe unto his rags. Enter Snap, Hubert, and Hemskirke. Snap. A Cove: Fumbumbis. Prig. To your postures; arme: Hub. Yonder's the Towne: I see it. Hemsk. Ther's our danger Indeed afore us, if our shadows save not. Hig. Blesse your good Worships: Fer. One small piece of money. Prig. Amongst us all poore wretches: Ger. Blinde, and lame, Ginks. For his sake that gives all. Hig. Pittifull Worships; Snap. One little doyt. Enter Jaculine. Jac. King, by your leave, where are you? Ger. To buy a litle bread, Hig. To feed so many Mouths, as will ever pray for you. Prig. Here be seven of us. Hig. Seven, good Master, Ã´ remember seven, Seven blessings. Fer. Remember, gentle Worship. Hig. 'Gainst seven deadly sins, Prig. And seven sleepers. Hig. If they be hard of heart, and will give nothingâ Alas, we had not a charity this three dayes. Hub. Ther's amongst you all? Fer. Heaven reward you. Prig. Lord, reward you? Hig. The Prince of pitty blesse thee. Hub. Do I see? or is't my fancy that would have it so? Ha? 'tis her face: come hither Maid. Jac. What ha', you Bells for my squirrell? I ha' giv'n Bun meat, You do not love me, do you? catch me a butter fly, And I'le love you againe; when? can you tell? Peace, we go a birding: I shall have a fine thing. Hub. Her voyce too sayes the same; but for my head I would not that her manners, were so chang'd, Heare me thou honest fellow; what's this Mayden, That lives amongst you here? Gincks. Ao, ao, ao, ao. Hub. How? nothing but signes? Gin. Ao, ao, ao, ao. Hub. This strange, I would faine have it her, but not her thus. Hig. He is de-de-de-de-de-de-deafe, and du-du-dudeâdumb Sir. Hub. Slid they did all speak plain ev'n now me thought Do'st thou know this same Maid? Sn. Why, why, why, why, which, gu, gu, gu, gu, Gods foole She was bo-bo-bo-bo-borne at the barne younder, By-be-be-be-be-Beggars Bush-bo-bo-Bush Her name is, My-my-my-my-my-match: so was her Mo-mo-mo-Mothers too-too Hub. I understand no word she sayes; how long Has she been here? Sn. Lo-lo-long enough to be ni-ni-nigled: and she ha' go-go-go-good luck, Hub. I must be better inform'd, then by this way. Here was another face too, that I mark'd O the old mans: but they are vanish'd all Most sodainly: I will come here againe, O, that I were so happy, as to finde it, What I yet hope? it is put on. Hem. What meane you Sir, To stay there with that stammerer? Hub. Farewell friend,â It will be worth returne, to search: Come, Protect us our disguize now, pre'thee Hemskirck If we be taken, how do'st thou imagine This Towne will use us, that hath stood so long Out, against Woolfort? Hem. Ev'n to hang us forth Upon their walls a sunning, to make Crowes meate, If I were not assur'd 'o the Burgomaster, And had a pretty skuys, to see a niece there, I should scarce venture. Hub. Come 'tis now too late To looke back at the ports: good luck, and enter. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Floriz. Flo. Still blow'st thou there? and from all other parts, Do all my Agents sleepe? that nothing comes? Ther's a conspiracy of windes, and servants: If not of Elements, to ha' me breake; What should I thinke unlesse the Seas, and Sandes Had swallow'd up my ships? or fire had spoyl'd My ware-house? or death devour'd my Facto I must ha' had some returnes; Enter Merchants. 1. Mer. 'Saue you Sir. Flo. 'Save you. 1. Mer. No newes, yet 'o your Ships? Flo. Not any yet Sir. 1. Mer. 'Tis strange. Flo. 'Tis true Sir: what a voyce was here now? This was one passing bell, a thousand ravens Sung in that man now, to presage my ruines. 2. Mer. Goswin, good day, these winds, are very constant. Flo. They are so Sir; to hurtâ 2. Mer. Ha? you had no letters, Lately from England, nor from Denmark? Flo. Neither. 2. Mer. This winde brings them; nor no newes over land, Through Spaine, from the Straights? Flo. Not any. 2. Mer. I am sorry Sir. Flo. They talke me downe: and as 'tis said, of Vultures They sent a feild fought, and do smell the carkasses By many hundred miles: So do these, my wracks At greater distances: why thy will heaven Come on, and be: yet if thou please, preserve me; But in my owne adventure, here at home, Of my chast love, to keep me worthy of her, It shall be put in scale against all ill fortunes: I am not broken yet: nor should I fall, Me thinkes with lesse then that, that ruines all. Exit ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter. Van-dunck. Hubert. Hemskirck. and Margaret. Boores. Van. Captaine you are welcome; so is this your friend Most safely welcome, though our Towne stand out Against your Master; you shall finde good quarter. The troth is, we not love him: Meg: some wine, Let's talke a little treason, If we can Talk treason, gain' the Traitors; by your leave, Gentlemen We here in Brugis, thinke he do's usurpe, And therefore I am bold with him. Hub. Sir, your boldnesse, Happely becomes your mouth, but not our eares, While we are his servants; And as we come here, Not to aske questions, walke forth on your walls; Visit your courtes of guard, view your Munition, Aske of your corne-provisions, nor enquire Into the least, as spies upon your strengthes, So let's entreate, we may receive from you Nothing in passage or discourse, but what We may with gladnesse, and our honesties here, And that shall seale our welcome. Van. Good: let's drinke then, Mage: fill out, I keep mine old pearle still Captaine. Mar. I hang fast man. Hem. Old Iewels, commend their keeper, Sir. Van. Heer's to you with a hart, my Captaines friend, With a good heart, and if this make us speake Bold words, anon: 'tis all under the Rose Forgotten: drowne all memory, when we drinke. Hub. 'Tis freely spoken noble Burgomaster, I'le do you right. Hem. Nay Sir mine heire Van-dunck, Is a true Statesmen. Van. Fill my Captaines cup there, Ã´ that your Master Woolfort. Had been an honest man. Hub. Sir? Van. Under the Rose. Hem. Heer's to you Marget. Mar. Welcom; welcom Captaine. Van. Well said my pearle still, Van. Well said, my pearl still, Hem. And how does my Niece? Almost a woman; I thinke? This friend of mine, I drew along with me, through so much hazard, Only to see her: she was my errand. Van. I, a kinde Uncle you are (fill him his glasse) That in seven yeares, could not find leizure.â Hem. No, It's not so much. Van. I'le bate you nev'r an houre on't, I was before the Brabander gan his war, For moone-shine, i'th water there, his daughter That never was lost: yet you could not finde time To see a Kinswoman: But shee is worth the seeing Sir. Now you are come, you aske if she were a woman? Shee is a woman Sir; fetch her forth Margee. Exit Marg. And a fine woman, and has Suitors. Hem. How? What Suitors are they. Van. Bachellors: young Burgers: And one, a gallant, the young Prince of Merchants, We call him here, in Bruges. Hem. How? a Merchant? I thought Van-doncke, you had understood me better, And my Niece too, so trusted to you by me: Then t'admit of such in name of Suitors. Van. Such? he is such a such, as were she mine I'de give him thirty thousand crownes with her. Hem. But the same things Sir, fit not you and me. Exit. Van. Why, give's some wine, then; This will fit us all: Here's to you still, my Captains friend: All out: And still, would Woolfort were an honest man, Under the Rose, I speake it: but this Merchant Is a brave boy: he lives so, i'the towne here, We know not what to thinke on him: At sometimes We feare he will be Bankrupt; he do's stretch Tenter his credite so; embraces all, And too't, the winds have been contrary, long. But then, if he should have all his returnes, We thinke he would be a King, and are halfe sure on't. Your Master is a Traytor, for all this Under the Rose: here's to you; and usurps The Earldome from a better man. Hub. I marry Sir, Where is that man? Van. Nay soft: and I could tell you 'Tis ten to one I would not: here's my hand, I love not Woolfort: fit you still, with that: Here comes my Captaine againe, and his fine Niece, And ther's my Merchant: view him well, fill wine here. Enter Hemskirke, Bertha, and Florez. Hem. You must not only know me for your Uncle, Now, but obey me; you, goe cast your selfe Away, upon a dunghill here? a Merchant? A petty fellow? one that makes this trade With oathes and perjuries? Flo. What is that you say Sir? If it be me you speake of; as your eye Seemes to direct: I wish you would speake to me, Sir. Hem. Sir, I do say, she is no Merchandize, Will that suffice you? Flo. Merchandize good Sir, Though ye be Kinsman to her: take no leave thence To use me with contempt: I ever thought Your Niece above all price. Hem. And do so still, Sir, I assure you, her rate's at more then you are worth. Flo. You do not know, what a Gentleman's worth sir, Nor can you value him. Hub. Well said Merchant. Van. Nay, Let him alone, and ply your matter. Hem. A Genntleman? What, o' the wool-pack? or the Sugar-chest? Or lists of Velvet? which is't? pound, or yard, You vent your Gentry by? Hub. O Hemskirke, fye. Van. Come, do not mind 'em drink, he is no Woolfort, Captaine, I advise you. Hem. Alas, my pretty man, I think't be angry, by its looke: Come hither, Turne this way, a little: if it were the blood Of Charlemaine, as't may (for ought I know) Be some good Botchers issue, here in Bruges. Flo. How? Hem. Nay: I'me not certaine of that; of this I am, If it once buy, and sell, its Gentry is gone. Flo. Ha, ha; Hem. You are angry, though ye laugh. Flo. No, now 'tis pitty Of your poor argument. Do not you, the Lords, Of land (if you be any) sell the grasse, The corne, the straw, the milke, the cheese? Van. And butter: Remember butter; doe not leave out butter. Flo. The Beefs and Muttons that your grounds are stor'd with? Swine, with the very mast, beside the woods? Hem. No, for those sordid uses, we have Tenants, Or else our Bay liffs. Flo. Have not we Sir, Chap-men, And Factors, then to answer these? your errour Fetch'd from the Heralds A B C. and said over With your Court faces, once an houre, shall never Make me mistake my selfe. Do not your Lawyers Sell all their practise, as your Priests their prayers? What is not bought, and sold? The company That you had last, what had you fort, y'faith? Hem. You now grow sawcy. Flo. Sure I have been bred Still, with my honest liberty, and must use it. Hem. Upon your equals, then. Flo. Sir, he that will Provoke me first, doth make himselfe my equall. Hem. Do ye heare? no more. Flo. Yes Sir, this little, I pray you, And't shall be aside, then after, as you please, You appeare the Uncle, siir, to her I love, More then mine eyes; and I have heard your scorns With so much scoffing, and so much shame, As each strive which is greater: But, beleeve me I suck'd not in this patience with my milke. Do not presume, because you see me young, Or cast despights on my profession For the civility and tamenesse of it. A good man beares a contumely worse Then he would do an injury. Proceed not To my offence: wrong is not still successefull, Indeed it is not: I would approach your Kins-woman With all respect, done to your selfe and her. Hem. Away Companion: handling her? take that. Flo. Nay, I do love no blows, sir, there's exchange. Hub. Hold sir, Mar. O murther. Ber. Help, my Goswin. Mar. Man. Van. Let 'em alone; my life for one. Flo. Nay come If you have will. Hub. None to offend you, I, Sir. Flo. He that had, thank himself: not hand her? yes Sir, And claspe her, and embrace her; and (would she Now goe with me) bear her through all her race, Her Father, Brethren, and her Uncles, arme'd, And all their Nephews, though they stood a wood Of pikes, and wall of Canon: kisse me Gertrude, Quake not, but kisse me. Van-d. Kisse him, girle, I bid you; My Merchant royall; feare no Uncles: hang 'em, Hang up all Uncles: Are we not in Bruges? Under the Rose here? Flo. In this circle, Love, Thou art as safe, as in a towre of brasse; Let such as do wrong, feare. Van. I, that's good, Let Woolfort looke to that. Flo. Sir, here she stands, Your Niece, and my beloved. One of these titles She must apply to; if unto the last, Not all the anger can be sent unto her, In frowne, or voyce, or other art, shall force her, Had Hercules a hand in't: Come, my Joy, Say thou art mine, aloud Love, and professe it. Van. Doe: and I drinke to it. Flo. Prethee say so, Love. Ber. 'Twould take away the honour from my blushes: Doe not you play the Tyrant, sweet: they speake it. Hem. I thanke you Niece. Flo. Sir, thanke her for your life, And fetch your sword within. Hem. You insult too much With your good fortune, Sir. Exit Florez. Hub. A brave deare spirit; Hemskirke, you were too blame: a civill habit Oft covers a good man: and you may meete In person of a Merchant, with a soule As resolute, and free, and all wayes worthy, As else in any file of man-kinde: pray you, What meant you so to slight him? Hem. 'Tis done now, Aske no more of it; I must suffer. Exit Hemskirk. Hub. This, Is still the punishment of rashnesse, sorrow; Well; I must to the woods, for nothing here Will be got out. There, I may chance to learne Somewhat to help my enquiries further. Van. Ha? A Looking-glasse? Hub. How now, brave Burgo master? Van. I love no Woolforts, and my names Vandoncke, Hub. Van-donke it's rather: Come, go sleep within. Van. Earle Florez is right heir, and this same Woolfort Under the Rose I speake it.â Hub. Very hardly. Vand. Usurpes: and a cambe Traitor, as ever breathed, And all that do uphold him. Let me goe, No pain shall hold me, that upholds him; Doe you uphold him? Hub. No. Van. Then hold me up. Exeunt. Enter Florez and Hemskirke. Hem. Sir, I presume, you have a sword of your owne, That can so handle anothers. Flo. Faith you may Sir. He. And ye have made me have so much better thoughts of you As I am bound to call you forth. Flo. For what Sir? Hem. To the repairing of mine honour, &amp; hurt here. Flo. Expresse your way. Hem. By fight, and speedily. Flo. You have your will: Require you any more? Hem. That you be secret: and come single. Flo. I will. Hem. As you are the Gentlem? you would be thought. Flo. Without the Conjuration: and I'le bring Only my sword, which I will fit to yours, I'le take his length within. Hem. Your place now Sir? Flo. By the Sand-hills. Hem. Sir, nearer to the woods, If you thought so, were fitter. Flor. There, then. Hem. good. Your time? Flo. 'Twixt seven and eight. Hem. You'l give me Sir Cause to report you worthy of my Niece, If you come, like your promise. Flo. If I do not Let no man think to call me unworthy first, I'le doe't my selfe: and justly wish to want her.â Exeunt.</field>

Hem. Away with me then, The time draws on, I must remove so insolent a Suitor, And if he be so rich, make him pay ransome Ere he see Bruges towres againe: thus wise men Repaire the hurts they take by a disgrace, And piece the Lyons skyn with the Foxes case. Ger. I am glad I have heard this sport yet. Hem. Ther's for thy drink; come pay the house within boyes, And loose no time. Ger. Away with all our hast too. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Florez. Flo. No winde blow faire yet? no returne of moneys? Letters? nor any thing, to hold my hopes up? Why then 'tis destin'd, that I fall, fall miserably, My credite I was built on, sinking with me. Thou boystrous North-wind, blowing my mis-fortunes, And frosting all my hopes to cakes of coldnesse, Yet stay thy fury: give the gentle South Yet leave to court those sailes that bring me safety, And you auspicious fires, bright twins in heaven Daunce on the shrowds: he blows still, stubbornly, And on his boystrous racke rides my sad ruine; There is no help, there can be now no comfort, To morrow with the Sun-set sets my credite. Oh misery! thou curse of man, thou plague, In the midst all our strength thou strik'st us; My vertuous Love is toss'd too: all, what I have been, No more hereafter to be seen then shadow; To prison now? well, yet ther's this hope left me, I may sinke fairely under this dayes venture And so to morrow's cross'd, and all those curses: Yet manly I'le invite my fate, base fortune Shall never say, she has cut my throate in feare. This is the place his challenge call'd me too, And was a happy one at this time for me, For let me fall before my foe i'the field, And not at Bar, before my Creditors, Ha's kept his word: now Sir, your swords tongue only Loud as you dare, all other languageâ Enter Hemskirke. Hem. Well Sir, You shall not be long troubled: draw. Flo. 'Tis done Sir, And now have at ye. Hem. Now. Enter Boores. Flo. Betray'd to Villains? Slaves ye shall buy me bravely, And thou base coward. Enter Gerrard and Beggars. Ger. Now upon 'em bravely, Conjure 'em soundly boyes. Boores. Hold, hold. Ger. Lay on still, Down with that Gentleman rogue, swinge him to stirrup: Retire Sir, and take breath: follow and take him, Take all, 'tis lawfell prize. Boores. We yield. Ger. Downe with 'em Into the wood, and rifle 'em, tew 'em, swinge 'em, Knocke me their braines into their breeches. Exeunt. Boors. Hold, hold. Flo. What these men are I know not, nor for what curse They shou'd thus thrust themselves into my danger, Can I imagine. But sure heavens hand was in't, Nor why this coward knave should deale so basely To eate me up with slaves: but heaven, I thanke thee, I hope thou hast reserv'd me to an end Fit for thy creature, and worthy of thine honour: Would all my other dangers here had suffered, With what a joyfull heart should I goe home then? Wher now, heaven knows; like him that waits his sent?ce Or heares his passing bell; but ther's my hope still. Enter Gerrard. Ger. Blessing upon you Master. Flo. Thanke ye; leave me, For by my troth I have nothing now to give thee. Ger. Indeed I do not aske Sir, only it grieves me To see ye looke so sad; now goodnesse keepe ye From troubles in your minde. Flo. If I were troubled What could thy comfort do? prethee Clause, leave me. Ger. Good Master be not angry; for what I say Is out of true love to ye. Flo. I know thou lov'st me. Ger. Good Mr. blame that love then, If I prove so sawcy To aske ye why ye are sad. Flo. Most true, I am so, And such a sadnesse I have got will sinke me. Ger. Heaven shield it, Sir. Flo. Faith thou must loose thy Master. Ger. I had rather loose my neck Sir: would I knewâ Flo. What would the knowledg do thee good, so miserable, Thou canst not help thy selfe? when all my ways Nor all the friends I haveâ Ger. You do not know Sir, What I can doe: cures sometimes, for mens cares Flow, where they least expect 'em. Flo. I know thou wouldst doe, But fare-well Clause, and pray for thy poore Master. Ger. I will not leave ye. Flo. How? Ger. I dare not leave ye, And till ye beate me dead, I must not leave ye. By what ye hold most pretious, by heavens goodnesse, As your faire youth may prosper, good Sir tell me: My minde beleeves yet something's in my power May ease you of this trouble. Flo. I will tell thee For a hundred thousand crownes upon my credit, Taken up of Merchants to supply my traffiques, The windes and weather envying of my fortune, And no returne to help me off, yet shewing To morrow, Clause, to morrow, which must come In spron, thou shalt finde me poore, and broken. Ger. I cannot blame your griefe Sir. Flo. Now, what say'st thou? Ger. I say you should not shrinck, for he that gave ye, Can give you more, his power can bring ye off Sir, When friends and all forsake ye, yet he see you. Flo. That's all my hope. Ger. Hope still Sir, are you tide Within the compasse of a day, good Master, To pay this masse of money? Flo. Ev'n to morrow; But why do I stand mocking of my misery? Is't not enough the floods, and friends forget me? Ger. Will no lesse serve? Flo. What if it would? Ger. Your patience, I do not aske to mock ye: 'tis a great sum, A sum for mighty men to start, and stick at; But not for honest: have ye no friends left ye, None that have felt your bounty? worth this duty? Flo. Duty? thou know'st it not. Ger. It is a duty, And as a duty, from those men have felt ye, Should be return'd againe: I have gain'd by ye, A daily almes these seven yearess you have showr'd me, Will halfe supply your want. Flo. Why do'st thou foole me? Can'st thou worke miracles? Ger. To save my Master, I can worke this. Flo. Thou wilt make me angry with thee. Ger. For doing good? Flo. What power hast thou? Ger. Enquire not: So I can do it, to preserve my Master; Nay if it be three parts. Flo. O that I had it, But good Clause, talke no more, I feele thy charity, As thou has felt mine: but alas! Ger. Distrust not. Tis that that quenches ye: pull up your spirit, Your good, your honest, and your noble spirit; For if the fortunes of ten thousand people Can save ye, rest assur'd; you have forgot Sir, The good ye did, which was the power you gave me; Ye shall now know the King of Beggars treasure: And let the windes blow as they please, the Seas roare, Yet, here to morrow, you shall finde your harbour Here faile me not, for if I live I'le fit ye. Flo. How faine I would believe thee. Ger. If I ly Master, Believe no man hereafter. Flo. I will trye thee, But he knowes, that knowes all. Ger. Know me to morrow, And if I know not how to cure ye, kill me; So passe in peace, my best, my worthiest Master. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Hubert like a Huntesman. Hub. Thus have I stolne away disguiz'd from Hemskirck To try these people, for my heart yet tells me Some of these Beggars, are the men I looke for Appearing like my selfe, they have no reason (Though my intent is faire, my maine end honest) But to avoyde me narrowly, that face too, That womans face, how neere it is: Ã´ may it But prove the same, and fortune how I'le blesse thee; Thus, sure they cannot know me, or suspect me, If to my habit I but change my nature; As I must do; this is the wood they live in, A place fit for concealement: where, 'till fortune Crowne me with that I seeke, I'le live amongst 'em. Exit. Enter Higgen, Prig. Ferret. Ginks. and the rest of the Boores. Hig. Come bring 'em out, for here we sit in justice: Give to each one a cudgell, a good cudgell: And now attend your sentence, that you are rogues, And mischeivous base rascalls, (ther's the point now) I take it, is confess'd. Prig. Deny it if you dare knaves. Boores. We are Rogues Sir. Hig. To amplify the matter then rogues as ye are, And lamb'd, ye shall be ere we leave ye. Boores. Yes Sir. Hig. And to the open handling of our justice, Why did ye this upon the proper person Of our good Master? were you drunk when you did it? Boores. Yes indeed were we. Prig. You shall be beaten sober. Hig. Was it for want you undertooke it? Boores. Yes Sir. Hig. You shall be swing'd aboundantly. Prig. And yet for all that, You shall be poore rogues still. Hig.

Boores. 'Tis most true Sir. Hig. Is not the man, an honest man? Boores. Yes truly. Hig. A liberall Gentleman? and as ye are true rascalls Tell me but this, have ye not been drunk, and often, At his charge? Boores. Often, often. Hig.

You most abhominable stincking Rascalls, You turnip-eating Rogues. Boores. We are truly sorry. Prig. Knock at your hard harts Rogues, and presently Give us a signe you feele compunction, Every man up with's cudgell, and on his neighbour Bestow such almes, 'till we shall say sufficient, For there your sentence lyes without partiality; Either of head, or hide, Rogues, without sparing, Or we shall take the paines to bear you dead else: You shall know your doom. Hig. One, two, and three about it. Prig. That fellow in the blew, has true compunction, He beates his fellowes bravely, oh, well struck boyes, Enter Gerrard. Hig.

What power hast thou to aske me? Ger. I will know it. Or plea thee till thy paine discover it. Hem. He did me wrong, base wrong. Ger. That cannot save ye, Who sent ye hither? and what further villanies Have ye in hand? Hem. Why would'st thou know? what profit, If I had any private way, could rise Out of my knowledge, to do thee commodity? Be sorry for what thou hast done, and make amends foole I'le talke no further to thee: nor these rascalls. Ger. Tye him to that tree. Hem. I have told you whom I follow. Ger.

Prick ye the fearefull hare through crosse wayes, sheepe walkes And force the crafty Reimald climb the quiksetts; Rouse ye the lofty, Stag, and with my bell-horne, Ring him a knell, that all the woods shall mourne him, 'Till in his funerall teares, he fall before me? The Polcat, Marterne, and the rich skin'd Lucerne, I know to chase, the Roe, the winde out-stripping Isgrin himselfe, in all his bloody anger; I can beate from the bay, and the wild Sounder Single, and with my arm'd staffe, turne the Boare, Spight of his fomy tushes, and thus strike him; 'Till he fall downe my feast.

Ger. Now interpret this unto him. Hig. I powre on thy pate a pot of good ale, And by the Rogues oth a Rogue thee install: To beg on the way, to rob all thou meetes; To steale from the hedge, both the shirt and the sheetes: And lye with thy wench in the straw till she twang, Let the Constable, Iustice, and Divell go hang. Ger. So, now come in, But ever have an eye Sir, to your prisoner. Hub. He must blinde both mine eyes, if he get from me. Ger.

May mountaines first fall down beneath their valleys, And are no more mount upwards, when I suffer An act in nature so preposterous; I must o'recome in this, in all things else The victory be yours: could you here read me, You should perceive how all my faculties Triumph in my blest fate, to be found yours; I am your son, your son Sir, and am prouder To be so, to the Father, to such goodnesse (Which heaven be pleas'd, I may inherit from you) Then I shall ever of those specious titles That plead for my succession in the Earldome (Did I possesse it now) left by my mother. Ger. I do beleeve it: butâ Flo. O my lov'd Father, Before I knew you were so, by instinct, Nature had taught me, to look on your wants, Not as a strangers: and I know not how, What you call'd charity, I thought the payment Of some religious debt, nature stood bound for; And last of all, when your magnificent bounty In my low ebb of fortune, had brought in A flood of blessings, though my threatning wants And feare of their effects, still kept me stupid, I soone found out, it was no common pitty That lead you to it. Ger. Thinke of this hereafter When we with joy may call it to remembrance, There will be a time, more opportune, then now To end your story, with all circumstances, I add this only: when we fled from Woolfort I sent you into England, and there placed you With a brave Flanders Merchant, call'd rich Goswin, A man supplyed by me unto that purpose, As bound by oath never to discover you, Who dying, left his name and wealth unto you As his reputed Son, and yet receiv'd so; But now, is Florez, and a Prince, remember The countreys, and the subjects generall good Must challenge the first part in your affection: The faire maid, whom you chose to be your wife, Being so far beneath you, that your love Must grant shee's not your equall. Flo. In discent Or borrowed glories, from dead Ancestors, But for her beauty, chastity, and all vertues Ever remembred in the best of women, A Monarch might receive from her, not give, Though she were his Crownes purchase; In this only Be an indulgent Father: in all else, Use my authority. Enter Hubert, Hemskirke, Woolfort, Bertha and Souldiers. Hub. Sir, here be two of 'em, The Father and the Son, the rest you shall have As fast as I can rouze them. Ger. Who's this? Woolfort? Wool. I Criple, your faigned crutches wil not help you, Nor patch'd disguise that hath so long conceal'd you, It's now no halting: I must here finde Gerrard, And in this Merchants habit, one called Florez Who would be an Earl. Ger. And is, wert thou a subject. Flo. Is this that Traitor Woolfort? Woolf. Yes, but you Are they that are betraid: Hemskirke; Ber. My Goswin Turn'd Prince? Ã´ I am poorer by this greatnesse, Then all my former jealousies or misfortunes. Flo. Gertrude? Woolf. Stay Sir, you were to day too neare her, You must no more ayme at those easy accesses, Lesse you can do't in aire, without a head, Which shall be sodainly tri'de. Ber. O take my heart, first, And since I cannot hope now to enjoy him, Let me but fall a part of his glad ransome. Woolf. You know not your own value, that entreat Ger. So proud a fiend as Woolfort. VVoolf. For so lost A thing as Florez. Flo. And that would be so Rather then she should stoop againe to thee; There is no death, but's sweeter then all life, When VVoolfort is to give it: O my Gertrude, It is not that, nor Prince dome that I goe from, It is from thee, that losse includeth all. Wool. I, if my young Prince knew his losse, hee would say so, VVhich that he yet may chew on, I will tell him This is no Gertrude, nor no Hemskirks Niece, Nor Vandoncks daughter; this is Bertha, Bertha, The heir of Brabant, she that caus'd the warr, Whom I did steale, during my treaty there, For your minority, to raise my selfe; I then fore-seeing 'twould beget a quarrell. That, a necessity of my employment, The same employment, make me master of strength, That strength, the Lord of Flanders, so of Brabant, By marrying her: which had not been to doe Sir, She come of years, but that the expectation First of her Fathers death, retarded it, And since the standing out of Bruges, where Hemskirke had hid her, till she was neer lost: But Sir, we have recover'd her: your Merchantship May breake, for this was one of your best bottoms I thinke Ger. Insolent Devill! Enter Hubert, with Jaqueline, Gynks and Costin. Woolf. Who are these, Hemskirke? Hem. More, more, Sir. Flo. How they triumph in their treachery? Hem. Lord Arnold of Bentbusin this Lord Costin, This Jaqueline the sister unto Florez. Wol. All found? why here's brave game, this was sport-royall, And puts me in thought of a new kind of death for 'em. Hunts-man, your horn: first wind me Florez fall, Next Gerrards, then his daughter Jaquelins, Those rascalls, they shall dye without their rights: Hang 'em Hemskirke on these trees; Il'e take The assay of these my selfe. Hub. Not here my Lord, Let 'em be broken up, upon a scaffold, Twill shew the better when their arbour's made. Ger. Wretch art thou not content thou hast betraid us But mocke us too? Ginks. False Hubert, this is monstrous. Wool. Hubert? Hem. VVho, this? Ger. Yes, this is Hubert, Woolfort, I hope he ha's helpt himselfe to a tree. Woolf. The first, The first of any, and most glad I have you Sir, I let you goe before, but for a traine; Is't you have done this service? Hub. As your Hunts-man, But now as Hubert; save your selves, I will, The Woolf's a foote, let slip, kill, kill, kill, kill. Enter with a drum Van-donck, Merchants, Higgen, Prig, Ferret, Snap. Woolf. Betray'd? Hub. No, but well catch'd. and I the Huntsman. Van-d. How do you Woolfort? Rascall, good knave Wool: I speake it now without the Rose, and Hemskirck, Rogue Hemskirck, you that have no neice, this Lady Was stolen by you, and tame by you, and now Resign'd by me, to the right owner here? Take her my Prince. Flo. Can this be possible, Welcom my love, my sweet, my worthy love. Van-d. I ha' giv'n you her twice: now keep her better &amp; thanke Lord Hubert, that came to me in Gerrards name, And got me out, with my brave Boyes, to march Like CÃ¦sar, when he bred his Comentaryes, So I, to end my Chronicle, came forth CÃ¦sar Van-donck, &amp; veni, vidi, vici, Give me my Bottle, and set downe the drum; You had your tricks Sir, had you? we ha' tricks too, You stole the Lady? Hig. And we led your Squadrons Where they ha' scratch'd their leggs a little, with brambles, If not their faces. Prig. Yes, and run their heads Against trees. Hig. 'Tis Captaine Prig, Sir. Prig. And Coronell Higgen. Hig. We have fill'd a pitt with your people some with leggs Some with armes broken, and a neck, or two I think be loose. Prig. The rest too, that escap'd, Are not yet out o'the briars, Hig. And your horses, Sir, Are well set up in Bruges all by this time: You looke as you were not well Sir, and would be Shortly let blood; do you want a scarfe? Van-d. A halter. Ger. 'Twas like your selfe, honest, and noble Hubert: Can'st thou behold these mirrors altogether, Of thy long, false, and bloody usurpation? Thy tyrranous proscription, and fresh treason: And not so see thy selfe, as to fall downe And sincking, force a grave, with thine owne guilt, As deep as hell, to couer thee and it? Woolf. No, I can stand: and praise the toyles that tooke me And laughing in them dye, they were brave snares. Flo. 'Twer truer valour, if thou durst repent The wrongs th'hast don, and live. Woolf. Who, I repent? And say I am sorry? yes, 'tis the fooles language And not for Woolfort. Van-d. Woolfort thou art a Divell, And speaks his language, oh that I had my longing Under this rew of trees now would I hang him. Flo. No let him live, untill he can repent, But banish'd from our State, that is thy doome. Van-d. Then hang his worthy Captaine here, this Hemskirck For profit of th'example. Flo. No let him, Enjoy his shame too: with his conscious life, To shew how much our innocence contemnes; All practise from the guiltiest, to molest us. Van-d. A noble prince. Ger. Sir, you must helpe to joyne A paire of hands, as they have don their heartes here, And to their loves with joy. Flo. As to mine owne, My gratious Sister, worthiest Brother: Van-d. I'le go more, and have the bon-fire made, My fire-workes, and flap dragons, and good backrack, With a peck of little fishes, to drink downe In healthes to this day. Hig. Slight, here be changes, The Bells ha' not so many, nor a dance, Prig. Prig. Our Company's growne horrible thin by it, What think you Ferret? Fer. Marry I do thinke, That we might all be Lords now, if we could stand for't Hig. Not I if they should offer it: I'le dislodge first, Remove the Bush to another climat. Ger. Sir, you must thanke this worthy Burgomaster, Here be friends aske to be look'd on too: And thank'd, who though their trade, and course of life Be not so perfect, but it may be betterd, Have yet us'd me with curtesy, and bin true Subjects unto me, while I was their King, A place I know not well, how to resigne. Nor unto whom: But this I will entreat Your grace, command them, follow me to Bruges; Where I will take the care on me, to finde Some manly, and more profitable course To fit them, as a part of the Republique. Flo. Do you heare Sirs? do so. Hig. Thankes to your good grace. Prig. To your good Lordship. Fer. May you both live long. Ger. Attend me at Van-doncks, the Burgomasters. Ex. all but Beggars. Hig. Yes, to beat hemp, and be whipt twice a weeke, Or turne the wheele, for Crab the Rope-maker: Or learne to go along with him, his course; That's a fine course now, i' the Common-wealth, Prig, What say you to it? Prig. It is the backwardst course, I know i'the world. Hig. Then Higgen will scarce thrive by it, You do conclude? Prig. 'Faith hardly, very hardly. Hig. Troth I am partly of your minde, Prince Prig. And therefore farewell Flanders, Higgen will seek Some safer shelter, in some other Clymat: With this his tatterd Colony: Let me see Snap, Ferret, Prig, and Higgen, all are left O the true blood: what? shall we into England? Prig. Agreed, Hig. Then beare up bravely with your Brute my lads Higgen hath prig'd the prancers in his dayes, And sold good peny-worthes; we will have a course, The spirit of Bottom, is growne bottomlesse. Prig. I'le mand no more, nor cant. Hig. Yes, your six peny worth In private, brother, sixpence is a summ, I'le steale you any mans dogg for Prig. For Sixpence more, You'l tell the owner where he is Hig. Tis right, Higgen must practise, so must Prig to eat; And write the Letter: and gi' the word, But now No more, as either of these. Prig. But as true Beggars, As ere we were. Hig. We stand here, for an Epilogue; Ladyes, your bountyes first; the rest will follow, For womens favours, are a leading almes, If you be pleas'd look cheerely throw your eyes: Out at your maskes. Prig. And let your beauties sparkle. Hig. So may you ne'er want dressings, Iewells, gownes Still i' the fashion. Prig. Nor the men you love, VVealth nor discourse to please you. Hig. May you Gentlemen, Never want good fresh suites nor liberty. Prig. May every Merchant here see safe his ventures. Hig. And every honest Citizen his debts in. Prig. The Lawyers gaine good Clyents. Hig. And the Clyents good Councell. Prig. All the Gamesters here good fortune. Hig. The Drunkards too good wine. Prig. The eaters meate Fit for their tasts and pallats. Hig. The good wives kind Husbands. Prig. The young maides choyce of Sutors. Hig. The Midwives merry hearts. Prig. And all good cheere. Hig. As you are kinde unto us and our Bush, We are the Beggars and your dayly Beadsmen, And have your money, but the Almes we aske And live by, is your Grace, give that and then VV'eel boldly say our word is, Come agen.</field>
