      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âSt. Paul's. Enter Belmont and Wilford, disguised as Yeomen. Bel. Now, Wilford, still thy comrade when at school Or college; when 'twas peace, thy playfellow, Thy right-hand man in war; I'm by thee still In simple guise of honest yeoman's son, To do the bidding of thy fantasy. What is't?âWhy are we thus attired?âWhat road Are we to take? on what adventure bound? The argument wilt thou unfold to me Of this romance which thus we now begin? I see thy cheek is paleâthine eye, without The gladsome light that speaks a heart at rest; Still, to my questioning, answerest thou:â âCome, don a yeoman's coat and roam with me.ââ Thy wish is doneâDo mine. Unbosom thee, For till I find thy heart, I lack my own. Wilf. Remember'st, Belmont, what thou saidst to me, When such, or such, if e'er I took a wife, I said should be the 'haviour of my bride? Bel. 'Twas this:ââIn vain premise or calculate, How thou shalt fall in love. A fever that! Which comes upon you, sudden as the plague, Or intermittent! Love by rule, forsooth!â Love by philosophy!âThou shalt be smit In the twinkling of an eye!âinfected by A touch!âthis minute sound as mountain health, And helpless next, as bed-rid tenant of An hospital.â And hast thou proved it so? Wilf. Attend. Last week, I could not go the length Of Ludgate Hill, but I must horse it thither. Returning thence, a motley group of men, Mechanics, servants, masters, old and young, Collected round some object, which they seem'd To gaze with most admiring wonder on, Attracted meâWhat think you 'twas? A maidâ A maid attired in costless suit, but neat, Of humble russet!âsuch a distance wide Removed from any child of luxury Or wealth, that e'en a simple ribbon knot Denied its aid to set her bonnet off, Or snowy coif and kerchief! But what wealth Had nature rain'd where fortune seem'd to grudge The poorest drop of her enriching shower! Sight could not take it in!âthe tongue would stop Ere it could sum it halfâall terms of praise Too scant to value loveliness so rare! At thought of winning it, the heart grow wild, As his whom overflowing affluence Lifts from the depth of want! There stood the maid, Silent and motionless, with eyes on ground, Abash'd by the reflection of herself, Cast back upon her so on every side From mirrors that her charms described, indeed, By showing her their power! Bel. Remark'd she thee? Wilf. She did! My restless courser startled her; She raised her eyes; and, lo! they fix'd on mine With look, methought, of recognition, that I felt as though our very souls embraced, And through me ran a thrill unknown before; When, spiteful chance! my steed more restive grew, Defied command alike of spur or rein, And bore me from the maid! Bel. Ask'd you not who She was? Wilf. No. Bel. No! Wilf. As one in jeopardy Will lack possession of himself, nor use Some means of succour, at his very hand, I did not think of that, till out of reach on't! My steed, at length, compell'dâby whom I know notâ To check his mettle, I dismounted straight And hasten'd back on footâbut she was gone!â If my first look of her hath been my last, I'll never care to look on woman more! Bel. Thy lot is cast! I told thee, Wilford, so! To such conclusion ever comes his work Who makes philosophy the rule of love. Love knows no rule, and never rule knows less Than when obedience we'd exact from it. 'Tis an uncertain and a froward guest; Comes to us when it lists; abides as long As pleases it; and its own humour takes, Whatever may be ours! You'd go in quest on'tâ And lo! 'tis with you before setting out; You'd lay down terms for its sojourning with youâ And here it is on its own terms at home; You'd fain be rid on't, and 'tis fain to stay; You'd thrust it out of doors, and only find The threshold's not your own, the moment love Sets foot within it. Mean'st to seek this maid? Wilf. Ay, through the world! Bel. I'll help thee in the search; And if we find the city holds her not, As far as Rumford bear me companyâ Whither, this week, perforce I must repairâ And thence, where'er thou point'st, will I be thine. Wilf. Come on! I tell thee, if I find her not, I'm tenant for the house the sexton builds. [They go out. SCENE II. âA Chamber in Old Small's. Enter Old Small. Old S. Who'd have a sonâa plagueâto drive him mad? To hunt for, or to watch, from morn till night, To coax, to scold, and with no better thrift To-day, than yersterday! A lackwit, caught By this and that, and held by nothing. Now At bowls; next hour at cocking; presently A race, a show, a feast; and, after that, Perchance a quarrel. Anything but work. What, Peter! Peter! Enter Peter. Peter. Master, here am I. Old S. Well, Peter, where's my son? Peter. I could not find him In all Whitechapel, seek him where I would. I call'd in at the Cock, he wasn't there; The Fox and Geese, but came no better speed; The Fountain was burn'd down last Tuesday night; The Rising Sun has stopp'd since Lady-day; The Crown and Mitre swore at me when last I sought him there, so thither went I not; The Duke of Buckingham and he are out E'er since he broke the drunken tapster's pate; And never goes he to the Loggerheads, Except o' Sundays. Old S. Peter! Peter! Peter. Master? Old S. I sore mistrust thee, Peter. Peter. Master! me? Old S. Ay, by my troth, I do! mistrust thee, sore Thou'rt in his secrets! I'll be sworn thou art. I saw you wink to him, on Sunday last, At dinner-time. Last Tuesday night, you said, 'Twas only ten when he came in; and not A minute from the bolting of the door, The clock struck twelveâI heard it! Wednesday noon You took a bundle in, and said 'twas from The laundress; when I open'd it, and found A spendthrift cloak and jerkin, spick and span New from the tailor's board; and, worse than that, The whole of Thursday morning wast thou out; And when I ask'd thee where, thou couldst not tell! Canst tell me now? Peter. I went an errand, sir, To Barbicanâan errand of mine own. Old S. An errand of thine own to Barbican! How came I then to see thee at Mile-end? Peter. At Mile-end, sir? Old S. At Mile-end, sir! Thou runn'st An errand well. Peter. You saw me at Mile-end? Old S. When thou wast gone to Barbican! well, sir? Peter. From Barbican, I went, sir, to Mile-end, Not finding what I sought at Barbican. Old S. I have thee now, my piece of innocence! My spice of honesty! my serving-man, That runs so well on errands! At Mile-end I saw thee not, but saw thee at the foot Of London Bridge! Peter. The foot of London Bridge? Old S. Ay, sir! Peter. And where should you have seen me else? When what I sought and miss'd, at Barbican; And miss'd again in seeking, at Mile-end; At London Bridge I found. Old S. O didst thou so? Would thou wast o'er the bridge! thou jackanapes! Wast thou not too at Hackney that same time? At Greenwich down, and Chelsea up, the Thames? At Kensington and Islington besides? The Tower, St. Paul's, and Westminster to boot? Didst thou not foot, from breakfast-time till noon, Ground it would take a man a week to ride? Thou knave of nimble toe, but nimbler tongue! Varlet! thou went'st not to Mile-end, nor yet To foot of London Bridge, no more than I, That never saw thee there! I know not where Thou went'st, but whither thou wilt go I'll tellâ To Tyburn, sirrah! [Knock.] Let thy master in! [Peter goes out. His kennel never likes your chainÃ©d dog, And there are men like dogs, who loathe the thing, Howe'er it profit them, to which you tie them; Who, like your dog, would forfeit house and mess To break their chain, and forage for a bone. What if I take the collar from his neck, And leave him, like the prodigal of old, To his own will, till sad experience proves That freedom's is the bitterest mastery. It shall be so. He cannot come to worse, He may to better. I will do it straight. Enter Young Small and Peter. Young S. Good morning, father! Old S. Morning, dog! 'tis noon. Young S. Well then, good noon! Old S. Nor morning, noon, nor night, Thou bringest good to me; so wish me none; Where hast thou been? Young S. Hard by, at Master All-gain's. Old S. And what about? Young S. Playing at loggats, sir. Old S. At loggats? Spendthrift! Idler! Play at pence, Shillings, and pounds! Young S. I do what's next to that,â Play for them, sir. Old S. To lose them, cur! to lose them; Hast thou not lost to-day? Young S. No, by my troth. I'm winner, save a halfpenny, by a groat; And should have doubled that, but for foul play. But three we wanted, and the bowl was mineâ There stood the loggats, sir, a glorious sight, And only three to score! and here stood Iâ There's not a lad in all Whitechapel, sir, Is such a hand at loggats!âHere stood I, With victory in hand, sure as the bowl With which I thus took aimâA steady aim Is half the game at loggats, sirâYou mind We wanted only three; the bowl was mine; There stood the loggats; here stood Iâthey say I have an air at loggats!âThus I stand, My left leg planted like a buttress, soâ My body poised upon the right, with knee Bent neither more nor less; I'd like you, sir, To see me play at loggatsâLook, sirâ Old S. Pshaw! Come, throw the bowl, and make an end. Young S. An end I should have made on't, had I thrown the bowl! Old S. What hinder'd thee? Young S. A needle-full of thread! A nail of tape! a button-mould! a piece Of list! the vapour of a smoothing-board! Thus, as I said, I held the bowlâ'Twas all But thrown. Ne'er out of cannon-mouth look'd shot More certain of its aim, than from my hand The bowl look'd at the loggats. In a twink Six of the nine at least were lying low! âStop!â cries a snivelling tailor; âMaster Small, 'Tis not your turn to playââThe pair of shears, To clip me so, and thus cut up the game! Old S. Now mark me, Thomas Small; thou'rt twenty-one! What art thou master of? Young S. Of quarter-staff, Rackets, and fives.âI'm capital at fives!â Hop but the ball, I'm sure to make it fly Like bullet from a gun.âI play at bowls And quoits.âAt quoits I'm famous for a ringer!â And then I'll putt the stone with any man. Old S. Master thou art, I know, of idleness! But name to me the craft thou'rt master of. Art fit to be a turner? Young S. Burn the lathe! Old S. A cooper? Young S. Sooner I'd be staved to death! Old S. A smith? Young S. As lieve you'd hammer out my brains! Old S. A tailor? Young S. Slay me with a needle first! Old S. What then art fit to be? Young S. A gentleman! Old S. A gentleman? Thou scarce canst read! Young S. What then? That's nothing in a gentleman! Old S. Thou writ'stâ But such a hand, the clerk's a cunning one That makes it out. Young S. That's like a gentleman! Old S. Thou canst not cipher. Hand thee in a bill Of twenty items, and 'twill puzzle thee To add it up. Young S. That's quite the gentleman! Father, thou truly saidst I'm twenty-one, And he that's twenty-one by law's a man; So I'm a man, and as a man am free. I'm master now of handsome twenty pounds, Left to me by my godfather; to them Add thou what grace thy graciousness may please, And, in my own way, let me try the world. Old S. Thou'rt like a wayward horse that will not break; The training thee's all labour, profit none,â And thrift of fruitless toil's to give it up. Thy will would have thee free before thine age; Thine age, like a false friend, now backs thy will; Both are too strong for me, and so I yield. Wait for me. I'll be with you presently. [Old Small goes out. Young S. Does he consent, and am I free indeed! New bonds I fear'd to curb me in new rights, And he takes off the old.âI thrive apace. Most hopeful setting out! So fair begun Must needs fair ending have! Peter. You play'd that game Of loggats passing well. Young S. I play'd a gameâ But not at loggats, Peter. Never more I'll play at loggats! Peter, nought I've done But walk, since morning, up and down Cheapside, Feasting my eyes on ladies of the court And its precincts, that come to bargain there. O Peter, homely are the silks they wear To their more silken looks! A city coif Hath twice their pride! No tossing of the head; No turning of the shoulder, in disdain; But eyes that drop when they your glances catch, As if to let you gaze! Peter, I'll make My fortune! Peter. Prithee, how? Young S. Now try and guess! Peter. I could not guess, were I to try a week! Young S. Peter, thou canst be shrewd. Look at me, Peter; Scan me from head to foot. Premising, now, Thou knew'st me not, wouldst take me for the son Of Gilbert Small, the pin-maker? Peter. More like I'd take you for the son of Walter Husk, The baker, to the east of Aldersgate. Young S. A baker's son! A crust hath pith, as much As thou hast wit! Take me for son of him! Peter. He's tall, and so art thou. Young S. What's tall?âWhat's tall? Pronounce me son unto a barber's pole, Because 'tis tall! To say a man is tall Is nothing, Peter! Look at me again, And guess what way I'll make my fortune. There,â I fancy that's a leg. Peter. It is a leg! Young S. And thereunto's a foot. Peter. Yea is there, of A verity! Young S. Go to! You flatter, now. You think me vain; but I am not vain, although I have a leg and foot,âay, and a face Moreover! Peter. Certainly you have a face. He'd have a face who'd say thou hadst not one. Young S. Thou hast a wit, good Peter. Show thee but A thing, thou see'st it. Enter Old Small unperceived. Look at my waist! Now lift your eye a little farther up, And ponder how my shoulders spread! Dost see? Now on the wholeâto speak it modestlyâ Taking me altogether, am I not A very personable man? Now, Peter, How shall I make my fortune?âWhy, you fool! By love! Old S. [Coming forward.] Who marries thee, loves not herself: She goes a voyage in a fair-weather bark, That scuds while wind and current favour it, But, in itself, hath no sea-worthiness To stand their buffeting! Here, have thy wish; Thou'lt find no niggard hand has fill'd that purse. I give it thee to feed thy wantonness; But, e'en for that, I'd have thee chary on't! There's not a piece in it that's not made up Of grains of fractions, every one of which Was slowly gather'd by thy father's thrift, And hoarded by his abstinence! It holdsâ How many minutes, torn from needful sleep! How many customary wants, denied! How many throbs of doubtingâsighs of care, Laid out for nothing through thy waywardness! But take it with a blessing!âFare thee well! Thou never yet couldst suit thee, Thomas, to Thy father's house; but, should there come the time, Thou know'st the door, that still was open to thee! [Old Small goes out. Young S. Peter, I'll stay at home. The good old man! He loves me, Peter! Take him back the purse, And say I'll stay at home. Peter. And keep at home? Wait like his ledger on the desk? Young S. I will!â That isâI would. Peter. And follows, if I could. Young S. I fear it does. Peter. What's got, return'd, may not be got again. Young S. Peter, you counsel like an oracle! Peter. You've rubb'd your eyes till they are red. Young S. Indeed? Peter. Look in the glass! Young S. A pity not to make My fortune, Peter! Give me back the purse. I'll make my fortune! Go and get my trunk, And bring it after me to Cripplegate. Thou saidst, as I came in, thy place was lost On my account. I'll find for thee a new one. [Peter goes out. There's no controlling fate; and fate, I see, By love, has destined me to make my fortune. So farewell to my father's house! I could Be sad at bidding it good-byeâbut will not. I'll think on nought but how we'll meet again, When love fulfils what fate decrees for me; Bids Thomas Small a golden wedding hail, And sends him home a very gentleman! [Young Small goes out. SCENE III. âAn Apartment in Albert's House. Enter Albert and Emma. Emma. Why sigh'st thou, Albert? Al. This has troubled me. On Thursday, saidst thou? Emma. Yes. Al. I recollect! I recollect!âWas't not on Ludgate Hill? Emma. On Ludgate Hill. Al. It was. I recollect! She grasp'd my arms, as with the start, methought, Of sudden fear, which I accounted for, As at the self-same moment heard I near The furious prancing of a fiery steed! Rode he a steed? Emma. He did. Al. Then 'twas for him! The image, say'st thou, of my likeness, which, Before that field, which robb'd me of my sight, I gave to thee? Emma. So said our child. Al. Where is That likeness? Emma. In her custody. 'Twas that Betray'd to me the secret of her heart. She pray'd it from me. Of its costly case Despoil'd, I gave it herâand wonder'd soon To find her, when she thought she was alone, All lost in gazing on't, with signs that spoke Affection more than filial, getting vent In very tears, which, as they fell, her breast Uneasy heaving, seem'd with sighs to number! Al. Such things I've heard. Emma. What, Albert? Al. I have heard That subtle passion from a glance hath sprung, And in a moment e'en struck root so deep, No art could pluck it outâSo! Mark'd she how He was attired? Emma. He seem'd a yeoman. Al. So! That hope is quench'd:âof prouder state, this thing That seems a weed, had haply proved a flower! Emma. I prithee, Albert, how? Al. That brother, who, Unnatural, my lands confiscate seized, 'Tis said is father to a goodly son, The very image of his uncle, dead, As they believe me. Hope just kindled up, The youth, she saw, might prove that very son. He seem'd a yeoman? For this malady We have, perhaps, a medicineâthe knowledge of What she is, which still we've hidden from her. That she shall know to-morrow. Emma. Tell it her, And quit this wayward life. Thou'st laid by store Enough. Forsake the land which thee forsakes; Another one makes thee a franchised man, Far from the ban of this! There mayst thou take Thy title, in thy own land forfeited, And for our fair child find befitting mate. Al. I will notâcannot quit my native land! Bann'd as I am, 'tis precious to me still! It is my father's landâ'tis loved for that! 'Tis thineâthy child'sâit should be loved for you! It should be loved, if only for itself! 'Tis free, it hath no despot, but its laws! 'Tis independent; it can stand alone! 'Tis mighty 'gainst its enemiesâ'tis one! Where can I find the land the like of it? Its son, though under ban and forfeiture, Is envied. He's the brother of the free! No! no! I cannot quit my native land. For sight of other land I would not give The feeling of its breathâthe wall of him That does not forfeit it, which none may scale, However proud, unscathed, to do him wrong! I cannotâwill notâquit my native land! Emma. Then let us seek some quiet corner on't; Nor spend on thriftless hope, what, husbanded By wise content, would keep us more than rich. Al. Nor can I that. Who sees his house pull'd down, And does not strive to build it up again? Who sees his vessel sunk, and does not look For other hull to plough the waves anew? I cannot do't! I've lived on the high seas Of restless life; I would be on them still! Say I'm unfit for'tâI'd be near them still! The sailor, maim'd or superannuate, Seeks not an inland home; but near some cliff His hammock slings, in hearing of the surge He wont to cleave of yore! Come, lead me forth. Where's Bess? Emma. On errand gone to Aldersgate. Al. I would again she went not forth alone! My heart hath strange misgivings, touching her. Bold men infest our streets, who would not stop, By force to take what right refuses them; Like him who late, with his pernicious suit, Wounded her tender ear. Strap [without]. What, hoa! Al. Come in, Whose challenge sounds unwelcome, yet a friend's. Is it not honest Master Strap? Enter Strap (intoxicated). Strap. The same, Master of cobbling, as thy shoes allow, Which seek his lapstone old, and leave it newâ But to the matter, as they say. Al. What is't? Strap. Why, this it isâa truth as old as timeâ Grief hath this soother, 'tis not solitary, But, if 'twill look for't, finds its fellow grief. So does the wise man teach. Thou know'st I lost My daughter, Sunday weekâshe did not die. Romances drove the giddy vixen mad, And she eloped from me. For loss of her, I have ne'er been sober since! No comforter Like aleâsave sack; but sack's for rich men's cares.â Your friends!âSays one, âIt might have fallen out worse;â One, that it might be evil, sent for good; One, that the plague itself will have an end; And some will pity; some will scold; and some Will try to laugh me out of sorrowing. As twenty ways there are to mend a shoe Besides the soling, heeling, welting on't! Al. But what is this to us? Strap. Philosophy! If not philosophy, a moral, thenâ And if not that, why, then, a hint that thou Hast lost thy daughter, just as I lost mine. Emma. Have lost our daughter! Strap. With a difference, thoughâ Al. Nayâ Emma. Prithee, Albert, give him his own way; He's sure, at last, to take it; so we lose Our time, persuading him to progress ours.â Well? Strap. Well, I said there was a difference, But what of that? This road and that road meetâ Take which you will, you come to the same end. It matters not, my daughter, with her will, Thine against hers, is gone; since both alike Are lost. Al. How?âWhere?âWho forced our child away? Strap. A gallant, who behemm'd her in the street, With good a score of lusty followers, Flush'd swaggerers, that seem'd of no account To reckon lawless deeds! I heard a rout, And left my stall. There was she in the midst! Some following with outcry 'gainst the deed, But none with hand that dared to question it. Upon my child I thought, at sight of thineâ Thought of thy loss mine own brought home to meâ My brain was swimming, and I rush'd on him That held herâbut a fillip laid me down! Yet, brief as was the scuffle, and the end Untoward; profit came of it. This ring He wore, though how he left it in my hand I know not! Al. Give it me!âA jewel hath it? Yes! 'Tis no common ring. Perhaps a clue To trace the ravisher? Give me a sword, Get me a knifeâa dagger!âanything, So that it be a weapon! WretchÃ©d man! Why don't I ask you first to get me eyes! Thought of my heavy wrong, put out the thought Of what must help me to revenge my wrong! Oh, heavy loss! To have a father's heartâ To have a father's arm to second it,â And both be useless for the lack of sight! The queen! The queen! Strap. Wouldst see the queen? Then straight Repair to Temple Bar; to-day begins Her Royal Progress; there she's sure to wait, The mayor and citizens give her greeting there. Al. Lead on! My child!âMy child!âWhate'er betide, This hour will I unfold myself, and find, One way or other, period to my cares. Knows't thou where dwells a notary on the way? Conduct me to him!âOn!âWe'll meet our death Or find our child.âOn!âOn!âOur child!âOur child! [They go out. SCENE IV. âTemple Bar. The Houses on each side adorned with cloths of silk or velvet, gold or silver, hanging from the upper windows.âA crowd of Citizens, men and women, assembled. Officer. Stand back, sirs! Stand back there, I say!âWhy press ye forward?âBack there! back! Keep order till her highness pass. First Citizen. Will it be long, sir, ere she come? Officer. To answer that, I must know the measure of your patience. Stretches it to some five minutes hence, I dare warrant you she will be here quickly; for 'tis a good half-hour beyond the time she appointed to set out from Westminster. Second Citizen. Is't to Norwich, sir, her highness makes her progress this time? [Shouts without. Officer. To Norwich 'tis, sir.âPeace! her highness comes. Each keep his place, nor press upon the other; so one and all will see the sight. Here comes the lord mayor, with the aldermen and council, to greet her highness. More room!â Stand back!âStand back! Enter the Lord Mayor, &amp;c. Enter Procession through the Gates; Soldiers, Gentlemen Pensioners, Band of Gentlemen, Band of Knights, Band of Barons, Trumpeters and Heralds. The Queen, accompanied by ladies, closed up with Guards.â The Lord Mayor, &amp;c., advance and kneel to the Queen. Mayor. May't please your majesty, with duteous knees,â That for our loving and right loyal hearts Most truly vouch, as would our tongues for bothâ Our happy privileges, of the which Your gracious sceptre the high guardian is, Thus lowly at your highness' feet we lay; And with fair greeting, pray to welcome you To your good city, here, of London. Queen. Freely Do we accept your greeting, citizens Of London; of our loyal cities, chief; The princess fair of commerce, that defies The world to show her peer; whose merchantmen Throng the broad seas with gallant fleets, the which To float, the treasuries of kings might brag! The privileges, which at our feet you lay, We pray you to resume; and truly guard For her behoof, who, in her subjects' weal, Is proud to boast she still locks up her own. Mayor. Our duties ever on your highness wait! Queen. Proceed. Albert [without]. The queen!âThe queen!âWhere!â Where's the queen? Officer. Stand back! Queen. Make way!âWho calls upon the queen? Officer. So please your majesty, a beggar-man! Stand back! Albert. The queen!âThe queen! Officer. Stand back, I say! Queen. Hold, sirrah! Dare not stop my subjects' way That come in suffering to me! Did Iâwhen My birth-right crown'd me, and I pass'd along, My way beset with subjects, that more thick Begirt me with their blessings, than their eyesâ My chariot frequent stay, that I might take Their gifts of nosegays from poor women's hands, And shall I now pass on, nor stop to hear A poor man's prayer! Approach, whate'er thou art! [The Officer makes way for Albert, who enters. Albert. [Presenting a scroll.] LeadâLead me to her highness' feet! [Kneels. Justice, great queen!âJustice and mercy! Queen. How! Mercy appeals against justice; justice stops The mouth of mercy!âAsk'st thou, then, For both? Albert. For mercy I'd implore, great queen, for one, Whose high offence hath long contrition half Atoned for,âhalf, the loss of sightâhis just And heavy penalty for swerving duty! Justice I'd ask on one, whose daring wrong, In open day, has robb'd me of my childâ A virgin, gracious queen, of beauty rare, Although her father's eyes ne'er vouch'd for it! Queen. But went she of her will? Albert. No!âNo!âby force Just now!âi' th'public street!âin open day! Torn from her parents, whither know they notâ A mother that in him, who should protect Her child and her, finds but a heavy charge! A father, with the limbs, and heart of one, Still without eyes, is lopp'd of heart and limbsâ Unfit to succour those that cleave to him! O royal maiden, take a maiden's part, And, for her wrong, o'erlook the wrong, might stand Betwixt thy justice and her injury! Queen. Thy tears, old man, serve more than flashing eyes To kindle up our wrath! Know'st thou the name Of the offender? Albert. No. Queen. Nor rank? Albert. Nor rankâ Unless a ringâwhich, in a scuffle, that Befel with one, who tried to take her part, Came from the finger of the ravisherâ Serve as a clue to find him. Queen. Show it us! This ring is not a stranger to us! Ha! Waits in our train Lord Thomas Willoughby? Wood. No, gracious mistress. Queen. Read this document; [Gives Albert's scroll. Advise him straight of its contents; and add Our will, that on receipt, with prompt despatch, He lead the beggar's daughter to our feetâ His wedded bride! What to thyself relates, We'll read at leisure; what to thy child, at once We'll give our care to. Instruct us by what name Thou, now, art known, or title? Albert. The Blind Beggar Of Bethnal Green. Queen. Thy daughter's name? Albert. 'Tis Bess. Queen. Our own!âOf beauty rare, thou say'st? Albert. Most rare! Queen. And good? Albert. Most good! Queen. [To Attendant.] Look to this sightless man! Our pleasure 'tis he waits upon us. On! The glory it shall be of Bess's reign, Her lowest subject, if his cause is right, Hath, 'gainst her highest, odds; for beggar e'en, He, still, shall have his queen to side with him! [They go out. Enter Young Small and Peter newly attired. Young S. There!âSaid I not we should be late and lose The setting out, wherein we might have mix'd Unnoticed with the royal cavalcade; And all through fault of thee, that took'st such time To apparel theeâno doubt with wonderment At such surpassing gear!âLet's breathe awhile.â Peter, you'll ruin me! Is that a way A serving-man should bear himself?âConsiderâ Thy master, Peter, is a gentleman. Peter. To keep in mind on't strive I all I can! Young S. I say thou dost not, else would it appear. Peter. It shall appear. Young S. See that it do so, thenâ Especially when thou walk'st out with me. Then carry thus thy head, stand with an air! Walk with a gait, as thou wast somebody; And when thou speak'st, thou must speak up, like one That values not who hears;âbut not to me! To me, good Peter, do thou none of these! Speak small to me; wear thus thy head to me; Stand thou not with an air when I am by; Nor, when my eye's upon thee, move with gait Of somebody! Thou'rt ever nobody In presence of thy master!âminding still To bear thee like a gentle serving-man. Peter. I'll mind. Young S. And do so!âAnd remember too When I am seated, and thou wait'st on me, Thou layest not thy hand upon my chair. But stand at distance from'tânor yet in line, But good a foot behind the rearmost leg; Not in advance of that a barley-corn! And balance not thy body on one leg, With knee of t'other negligently bent, As if it said âI care not!â 'Tis not meet. But stand on both, as every joint of thee Acknowledged me thy masterânot astride, But heel to heel!âAnd keep thy finger from Thy button-hole!âbut not to cram it in Thy poke! Nor yet on hip to rest it!â'Twere As thou wouldst say, âI think myself a lord!â Thou wouldst not fold thine arms! Field-marshal, Peter, Could do no moreâdo nothing with thine arms, But let them hang! There! Seem'st thou now indeed A serving-man. Peter. Will that content you? Young S. Yes. But mark! Thou hast play'd with me at quoits and loggats, No more of that! Peter. I'll mind. Young S. And when I have order'd me a tankard out, And given it thee to hold, thou more than once Hast quaff'd it off to my good luck.âBe sure No more of that! Peter. I'll try and mind. But, sirâ Since so I must accost theeâwhat avail The gait and air of gentle serving-man, Without the pocket, should belong to one? Look there! Young S. What's that? Peter. A melancholy rap! A black-faced copper sixpence! Add to which A button without shank, and you sum up The pocket of your gentle serving-man! I ne'er can do without allowances! Young S. Allowances!âWhat wages got you from My father, Peter? Peter. 'Twere a cunning clerk Could count them,âPurse was never made, would wear With hoarding them. To coin them took it not Gold, silver, no nor copper! I served him for My bed and board, that board and bed were none, But shifts for them; a jerkin in the year And doubletâold apparel new made up; Hose, when the feet had walk'd away from them; Shoes, whose last mending had the cobbler brought To his last wits; and hat that gaped to see Its crown was gone; with what good luck besides Might send me. Young S. And thou want'st allowances! Do I not promise thee a pound a year? Jerkin and doublet, to provide thee with, The thirtieth penny on the counter rang The knell of half a crown! Hose got I thee, With feet unto them, newly vamp'd and darn'd! And from the cordiner, himself, direct, Wast thou not shod? Nor was thy head forgot. With thy well-furnish'd trunk to make it match. Did I not treat it to a crown-whole hat, Nor yet at outlay stopp'd, so ruinous, But in the hat a comely feather stuck, At charge of twice a groat? No more of this! Believe when thou'rt well off.âThere's twopence for thee, To show thee that thou serv'st a gentleman! Dream'st thou sometimes? Peter. I do. Young S. What's the best dream A man can dream? Peter. They say 'tis hanging. Young S. So! Didst thou not dream of hanging yesternight? Peter. I did. Young S. Thy dream's come out! Thy fortune's made, But knew'st thou itâCome on! Content thee, and Thou shalt have pence! Mind how thou bear'st thyself! Well done! But keep to that! So.âFollow me. [They go out. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âRoom in an Inn at Romford. Enter Hostess and Ralph. Hostess. Now have I told thee allâhow she came here On Tuesday night, sore faint and travel-worn, When thou at Epping wast upon the roam; How from her home, by bold and lawless men, She had been forced; how she escaped their hands; How, when she reach'd her parents' roof again, Deserted 'twas,âits tenants doubtless gone In quest of her; how, knowing not what way To go, she put her trust in Heaven to guide her, Which brought her to our door! Ralph. Inform'd she thee Who were her parents? Hostess. No. I ask'd, but saw The question troubled her, so ask'd no more. I see thou think'st her fair. Now, mark me, Ralph. Thou'rt less sedate, I know, than thou art wild,â And, still, I think there's in thy heart a check Of ruth and honesty, that draws thee back When passion 'cross their bounds would have thee wing. Beware then, Ralph, her beauty tempt thee not To do her wrong! She's poor! She has not friend, Of right, she here can call soâhas not home, Save what a stranger's roof supplies her with; The labour of her hands is all her means; Her virtue is their strength; who'd rob them on't, Were he my son, he were not villain only, But coward mean to boot! Ralph. Nay, mother, nay, I'm not that lackgrace yet! Give thou consent, I'm wived to-morrow, for sweet Bessy's sake. Hostess. I'll think on't, Ralph. Meantime bestir thee, son; Look to the gentleman, since Wednesday last Took up his quarters here. Ralph. The gentleman? My shoe's a gentleman! Hostess. How, sirrah! this Thy manners? Ralph. Mother, I overheardâ Hostess. Didst what? I'll have no list'ners in my house, No eaves-droppers! no ears that wait on keyholes! Who take their quarters up at the Queen's Arms, Shall have their secrets, as their luggage, safe! Fie on thee, Ralph! No more on't! Mind thyself! Thy mother's hard-earn'd gains not more were won By thrift than honesty; whom they enrich Must honest be as thrifty. So be thou! My son is he, not of my blood that's drop, But portion of my heart.âNot soâI'd take A hind that is, to be thy mother's heir. [Ralph goes out. All's right and tidy,âeach thing in its place, And cleverly put out of hand. No cup, Tankard, or flagon, but its face might show To polish'd silver, rich and bright as 'tis There's sure a virtue in her touch, that leaves All things it meets as ne'er they look'd before! Luck hath she brought with her. Since here she came, No house in Romford holds its head so high As the Queen's Arms, for balm of sparkling ale, Cordial of sack, and nectar of bright wine! Would she were wife to Ralph! We cannot hope To keep the treasure, long, that's coveted By all who see it, and by right's not ours. But, yet, who is she?âRalph's my son; and heir To good a hundred pounds a year, besides His father's house and land. Her courtesy might An heiress' self vouchsafe to make to Ralph; When he should wed, I ever look'd, at least, To give my blessing to some doctor's, squire's, Or curate's daughter. Wed him shall I to One knows not whom?âI'll question her more closely. His father, when he wived, took home his match, And so must he! She comes. [Bess sings without. No need to keep Blackbird or thrush, while she is in the house; So sweet and active is her pretty throat. What's that she looks thus constant at, whene'er She thinks herself alone! but when observed, Confused and startled, nestles in her breast? Enter Bess with her father's picture, which she frequently examines while she sings. The blind man's at the door, And won't you let him in? He plays the harp, he'll spare no pains, Your favour for to win. He'll sing you fits, one, two, or three, And he'll ask you a groatâno more; And, grudge you the groat, he'll be thankful for lessâ The blind man's at the door! He'll sing you stories, sad, He'll sing you stories, gay; And call as often as you please, He will not say you nay. If you fill him a cup, he's a happy blind man, As oft he has been before; But, grudge you the cup, he's contented with noneâ The blind man's at the door! The blind man's at the door, And shelter none has he; The sky doth smile, or it doth frown, But which he cannot see! If you welcome him in, what cares he for the sky? It may shine, or it may pour! But, grudge you that grace, wet or dry he must on!â The blind man's at the door! [At the conclusion of the song, the Hostess approaches and steals a look at the picture. Hostess. Whose picture is that, my Bess? Bess. My father's. Hostess. Then Was never father better loved than thine! Nay, blush not, that thou lovest thy father well! Show't me. He is a father to be loved! No wonder thou shouldst keep it next thy heart; I well could take't to mine! Thou blushest more And more. Thou silly wench! There, put it up. I like to hear thee sing, my pretty Bess; 'Tis gladness to my heart! Art happy, Bess, To live with me? Bess. As far as happiness Can live with Bess,âher parents lostâherself Unable to provide her home or friend! Hostess. Not so, my pretty Bess! Herself can best Provide her these. No customer that comes To the Queen's Arms, and hath unmistress'd house, But would be glad if Bess its mistress wereâ Knew he her history. Bess. [Aside.] Her history? Hostess. One likes to know Whence people comeâwho people areâtheir birth And parentage. Wast thou a lady born, I could not love thee better than I do; But loving thee so well, I'd know who 'tis, So well I love. Who art thou, pretty Bess? Bess. [Aside.] If I should say I am a beggar's child, The door, that took me in, may thrust me out! If aught beside, I speak what is not truth, And that I'll never speak!âYou think me good: You find me willingâuseful in the houseâ Not knowing who I am. To teach you that, More good, more willing, useful, makes me not; Then do not seek to know't! I dare be bound, If cause I give you not for more content, I'll give you none for less! Hostess. Where mystery is, Doubt is. We hide what we're afraid to show. If I be come of honest kind, care I Who knows my father's name? I'd cry it from The steeple-top! To be a friend, we needs Must find a friend. My friend is she, alone, That trusts me. If my love's not worth as much, Better I keep it to myself! Fair brow Thou hast, and open too! I ween thy heart's As fairâbut why is't not as open, Bess?â Why, whither goest thou? Bess. [Who while the Hostess has been speaking, has put on her cloak and bonnet.] I know notâbut I know I must go hence! You're right!â'Tis fit One know who 'tis they lodgeâwho 'tis they love. 'Tis little to ask that! Alas for them That are not masters of so small a boon! They may be question'dâwonder were they not! They may be doubtedâthey cannot complain! They may lack friendâthey've but themselves to blame! FarewellâThanks!âThanks! all thanks!â'Twas all a gift! The wind and rain, on which you shut the door That let me in, had just as much a right To enter it as I. I'm rested now, Refresh'd and strengthen'dâEvery foot I go I'll bless you that I am so! Hostess. Leave me, Bess! That shalt thou never! Give me off thy cloak! Prevent me not!âthy bonnet I'll untie, Or never more may I tie on my own! Ah! Bess, dost mind me? Care I who thou art? Or doubt I thee? or am I not thy friend? Nay, if thou leav'st the house, I leave it too! I'll have no house that does not roof thy head! For ever live with me! [Embraces her.] Want'st thou a right? A right thou soon shalt have. Ralph loves thee, Bess,â Whoe'er thou art, thou shalt be wife to Ralph! Nay, answer not! I say I'll have it so! See if I love thee now! Here's companyâ I'll look to them. Go dry thine eyes, sweet Bess! Thou shalt be daughter, wife, and all, my Bess! [They go out severally. SCENE II. âA Private Room in the Queen's Arms. Enter Ralph. Ralph. Look to thy birthright, Ralph!âAvails it not To be thy mother's son that nature made, Thou must be offspring of her humour too! Is't fault of thine that thou art not a wall? But listenest, when men, in earshot, tell Their loose-kept secrets! Gentleman, forsooth! My gentleman's gentleman!âthe scrub of him! The helper o' the scrubâa counterfeit, Not worth the brad should nail it to the counter,â To some vile counter,âhas been taken thence; And the base metal coin'd anew, to pass, To pass for honest coin! 'Twon't pass with me! He trusts to make his fortune by the priestâ Of some rich dame the favour sweet to winâ And thereunto he follows the queen's court; But stopping, on his way, at Romford, here Sets eye upon the linnet I would lime, And tarries at our house. But, lest he spoil My sport, I've pointed out the bush to him Where sits a goldfinchâbut a painted oneâ Our Kate, that vows to wed a gentleman!â Our chambermaid! to seek her fortune, come Like him to Romford, and alighted here. He takes her for a maid of noble stock; In her own right, a costly heiress, flying Compell'd espousals, and, in the disguise Of lowly chambermaid, close crouching, here To shun pursuit.âHa! Here she comes!âGood day. Enter Kate. Sweet Kate. Kate. Hold off! I'm Kate too sweet for thee! Ralph. Indeed! When shall we call thee wife, sweet Kate? Kate. When thou hold'st stirrup to my husband! Ralph. How! Will nothing less content thee? Marry, Kate, Marry thy match, or count to die a maid! Kate. My match is he that fits my thought, not thine. Ralph. Thy match is he that fits thy fortune, Kate. Kate. Not so, when I my fortune am above. Ralph. Their fortune, who're above, oft fall below. Kate. Leave me to look to that. Ralph. Look to it, then, Thy new year's gift I'll double for thee, Kate, If, ere the year comes round, thou curtsey not The wife of honest hind! Kate. The hind I'll wed Thou'lt touch thy bonnet to! Ralph. Ay, shall I, Kate, When he to me doffs his. Kate. Doffs his to thee? He first shall doff his head! Ralph. Nay, Kate, be friends! Not only do I wish thee well to wed, But, if I could, would help thee, pretty Kate; And I can help thee, if thou'rt in the mood. Kate. What! in the mood to help thee to a jest? Ralph. Thyself be judge! The gentleman that came On Wednesday, throws soft glances at thee, Kateâ Is that a jest? I've heard, thy cousin, Kate, Was cousin's cousin to the cousin of An earl, sweet KateâI've told him so! Is that A jest? Thou know'st how windfalls comeâHow men To-day but ragged knaves, next day are seen To strut as robÃ©d lordsâhow oft the tree Of noble family has wither'd, branch By branch, till none to bear its honours left, They're gone to cover some poor distant graft, The parent stock ne'er threw its shadow on! Why may't not hap to thee?âI think it mayâ I wish it mayâand, as 'tis easy, Kate, To fancy what we wish, I've told him, thou An heiress art, and hast a title, too! Is that a jest? Let but thy bearing back My giving out, I'd marvel not if ere A quarter of a yearâa monthâa week, I doff my bonnet to thy spouse, indeed! Is that a jest? Kate. Ralph, thou'rt an honest lad! Ralph. When thou repair'st to church, may I, sweet Kate, Make bold to kiss thee when the knotting's done? Kate. I shall not mind, for old acquaintance, Ralph. Ralph. And when thou'rt married, may I sometimes call? Kate. Ay, mayst thou, Ralph. Ralph. How often?âOnce a year? Kate. I'll not be angry, Ralph, though it be twice. Ralph. How kind thou art!âand when I call, sweet Kate, Wilt bid the lackey ask me in? Kate. I will. Ralph. And order Master Ralph a cup of sack, To drink thy health, while in the hall he stands? Kate. As sure as I shall be a lady, Ralph. Ralph. Thou shalt be married to a gentleman! And here he comesâObserve him, bonny Kate, The visage, figure, habit, air, and walk Of gentleman! To note his only gait, A man would say, or he lack'd brains, there goes At least a handsome thousand pounds a year! When thou shalt call him spouse! Away, my Kate. Don thou a whiter 'kerchiefâchange this cap For thy Sunday one, with bows as broad and red As full-blown peonies! and, soon as done, Come back again, when thou shalt find him hereâ And troll that pretty song you sang to us On Tuesday nightâas though you mark'd him not. Love in his heart be sure hath taken rootâ See how 'twill grow apace and come to fruit! Bear thee as lofty gentlewoman, Kate; Go proudly, Kate, and not as chambermaid! Of maids thou shalt be mistress!âWell done, Kate! [Kate goes out. Here comes, indeed, my gentleman, from top To toe new-furnish'd, as on conquest bent. [Retires up stage. Enter Young Small. Young S. Debate it thus. What's love? It is not land Or gold. 'Tis not attire or tenement; Or meat or drink! What is the worth on't then? Nothing! It makes not wiseâfor these are things That wise men covet, and 'twould counsel me To part with them. It makes not greatâgreat men Hath love undone. 'Tis not contentâI ne'er Saw lover yet but he was woe-begone! Its signs are willows, darts, and bleeding hearts! I'll none on't, I'm resolved! Sweet mistress Bess! Ralph. Sweet mistress Kate thou mean'st. Young S. Right, Master Ralph. Yet mistress Bess is sweet! But what of that 'Tis fit a gentleman a lady wedâ So Kate 's the maid for me! I'll conquer love! Love 's no small thing to conquer. Men fall sick For loveâgo mad for love!âhang, drown themselves!â But love has met its match when it meets me! You see I'm ready, Ralph. Ralph. I see you are. Ay, that's the way to go a-wooing! Young S. What, It strikes you? Ralph. Yes! Young S. The jerkin 's a new cut, Or else the tailor 's perjuredâOath he took It should be made as never jerkin was! Ralph. His oath he has kept! Young S. You mark my doublet too? Ralph. Else lack'd I eyes. Young S. And how the sleeves are slash'd? Ralph. 'Tis slashing work indeed! She must have heart Of stone, gives she not in. Young S. A fine effect! And then my hat!âWhat think you of the set? Ralph. A gallant setâa very gallant set, Most valiantly turn'd up! Young S. The feather red! Blood-red! and nearly of a rapier's length! The loop of warlike steel! So, what with loop, Feather, and set, methinks it is a hat CriesââTouch me not.â Ralph. Methinks it is. Young S. 'Twas made To special order! Ralph. So 'twould seem. Young S. You know They like a gallant bearing. I would look A very Hector, when I go to woo! Ralph. And thou hast hit it. Young S. On your honour, now? Ralph. Else never man hit anything. Young S. Indeed! I thank you, master Ralph. I'm glad you're pleased. You have a taste! Beshrew me but you have! How would you have me wear my rapier? So? Or so? Ralph. Why, soâIt better shows the hilt. Young S. A pretty hilt? I bought it for the hilt. The cutler would have palm'd upon me one Of better blade! He thought he had a fool To deal with! Buy a rapier for the blade! Who shows the blade? Ralph. Most true. Young S. I think I'll do. Ralph. No doubt on'tâHere she comes, sir.âThat's her voice. Didst ever hear her sing, sir? [Kate sings without. Young S. Never. Ralph. No! Then never did you hear a nightingale. Apart till awhile, sir, you'll hear her voice. Enter Kate, and sings. What shall I give to win your heart, My pretty chambermaid? What shall I give to win your heart? I've land! I've gold! With aught I'll part To make you mine, he said. The maid, kind sir, whose heart is sold, A well-a-day may sing! The maid, kind sir, whose heart is sold, Gives more than worth of land or goldâ Unless a golden ring! Say aught but that, my bonny queen, And thou'rt my own, he said. Say aught but that, my bonny queenâ Who gives not that, she said, is e'en Beneath a chambermaid! Take that, take that, and all beside, Be mine, be mine, be said! Take that, take that, and all beside; She's worth me, that must be my bride, Though but a chambermaid! Ralph. Up to her, sirâyet hold! I'll whisper her A word, commending thee. Your gentle blood Is skittish, sir, and mettlesomeâBehoves You tenderly approach, yet watchfully; 'Tis quick of instinct too, to know its kind. Was ever balance poised by thee or thine, Yard flourish'd, counter brush'd, or ledger scrawl'd, 'Tis odds she'll apprehend it in a trice. Thank fate, thou art indeed a gentleman! Young S. [Aside.] I'd thank it, never had I pass'd for one. A score of crowns for my own clothes again! What if she find, despite the tailor's craft, The hatter's, jeweller's, and milliner's, My suit is not a fit!âundress me!âbid me Put on the counter clothes again, and wait Upon my father's customers! The thought Has set my heart a-thumping! Thomas Small! Better thou hadst remain'd thy father's dog, Than ta'en a roam to Romford. Ralph. Kate, behoves Thou bear thyself as lofty gentlewoman. If he looks ten feet high, do thou look twenty; When he accosts thee, eye him up and down, And down and up again from head to foot; He verily believes thou art a lady, Keep him to thatâThy arms a-kimbo putâ Walk to and fro, and toss thy pretty head! Behoves fine ladies give themselves fine airs, Or who would know them fineâ Up to her now. [To Young Small. Young S. Fair Kate, a word I fain would speak to thee. Kate. [Following Ralph's direction.] Sir! [Young Small starts back, Kate walks about as instructed. Ralph. Now, stick up to her, or, as I live, You'll lose her, sir. Set thou to work as well, Pace to and fro, a yard at every stepâ Great men, I have remark'd, take mighty stridesâ That's right!âShe stopsâNow to the charge again! Tell her thou hast a guess of her estate; 'Twill soften herâbut mind thou nothing bate The feeling of thine own, as right thou shouldst not! Thou art, from top to toe, a gentleman! Young S. A cunning man who feels himself to be The man he knows he is not! I perceive 'Tis not the clothes that make the gentleman. Odzooks! she traversed me from top to toe, As she would lay me open with her eye. I vow I feel as I were like to swoonâ O Little Cheap!âSnug Little Cheap! As much As once I wish'd me out of thee, I now Wish I were back again! Ralph. Now, pretty Kate, Let's calm a littleâthou hast quite convinced him. Thou art, indeed, a gentlewoman born; Put off a cloud or two, and now and then, When next he speaks, give out a blink of sun, But not that he forget 'twas tempest, Kate. Take out thy 'kerchiefâhast thou one. Now draw it From corner unto cornerâbe it clean. Now pass it 'cross thy face, and back again; Now use it so, as ladies do a fan; Betray a little agitation, Kate; Swing on one foot thy body to and fro, And with thy other beat upon the ground. Now, sir, at once propose for herâspeak up! Have not a faint heart! Young S. No! Ralph. Remember you're A gentleman. Young S. I do! Ralph. And so you are From top to toe! Young S. I thank you, RalphâYou're good. Ralph. And so your father was before you, sir, And quite as much his father before him; Was he not, sir? Young S. Ay, quite as much, good Ralph, Or, if he was not, I'm no gentleman. Ralph. Then, now at once propose for her. Hem! twice Or thrice before you speak, and broadly hint At her gentility. Young S. Engaging Kateâ As gentleman should gentlewoman wed, So fain would I to wife take thee, sweet Kate! [Turns to Ralph. And now I must take breath! I tell thee, Ralph, To woo a lady is no easy thing. [Retires. Ralph. Kate, canst thou blush? If not, why hang thy head, And look as though thou knew'st not where to look, And clasp thy hands and twirl thy thumbs about, And make a shift to squeeze out half a sigh, But loud enough to hear. Well done! well done! Bespeaks her every way a gentlewomanâ Does she not, sir? [To Young Small. Young S. Upon my life it does. Ralph. Now bring her to the point of yes or no. Young S. Of yes or no? Ralph. Yes! Young S. Yes or no! I vow I tremble at the thought on'tâJust I feel As though I play'd at loggats, and a pound Were laid upon the game, and mine the throw. Ralph. Well, sir? Young S. Good RalphâI'll take a little time. Ralph. So do. He comes to pop the question, Kate. When first he speaks, no answer render him: Nor yet the second timeânor yet the third. Kate. No, Ralph? Ralph. Be patient, Kate! It were not meet, In such a strait, a lady speak at once! The thought should seem to take away thy breath; Thou shouldst appear as thou wast like to faint, And do, sweet Kate!âI'll be beside theeâFall Upon my shoulderâand when I say ânow,â Come to thyselfâbut mind, not all at once, But bit by bitâI'll have him at thy feet. Look at him once, and turn away againâ Another timeâand try to turn away, But, finding that thou canst not do't, cry âyes!â And, quite o'ercome, fall plump into his arms! You'll mind? Kate. Be sure of me. Ralph. Make sure of him! Up to her now, sir!âNow or never, sir! Young S. Dear Kate! wilt be my bride? Ralph. Again, sweet sir! Young S. Dear Kate! wilt be my bride, a second time? Sweet Kate, the third time. Wilt thou be my bride? [Kate falls on Ralph's shoulder. Ralph. I do believe she faints. Young S. She does indeed! She's a true ladyâOn my life she is. Ralph. Down on your knees, sirâboth your kneesâand chafe Her hands with yoursâkissing them now and thenâ And 'gainst she comes unto herself, 'twere well If you could squeeze a tear into your eye:â Fair Kate, awake! Your lover's at your feet, Kneeling as well behoves a gentlemanâNowâ Kate. [Recoversâfollows Ralph's directions.] Yes! [Throwing herself into Small's arms, nearly oversetting him. Ralph. Hold up, sweet sir, and try to bear This overpowering happiness!âTo both I wish a world of joy.âTake her apart [To Small. Into the garden. Never drop thy suit Until she name the day, and be't to-morrow. âThe cup, sir, and the lip!â But, gentle Kate, [To Kate. 'Tis not enough the bird is limed, behoves You have him in your handâGood sir!âfair lady! I give you joy, and wish you a good day! [Goes out. Young S. Come, gentle Kate, that is to be my bride. Kate. O, la, sir! Young S. Sir! call me thy Thomas, Kate. My name is Thomasâmaster Thomas. Kate. La! I ne'er can call thee Thomas. Young S. Yes, thou canst, And wilt!âdear Thomas!âthy own Thomas! Kate. La! Young S. As I will call thee my own Kate, be sure, As soon as we are man and wife. Kate. O, la! Don't talk of it. Young S. Of what else should I talk? Come Kateâmy wife!âmy lady Kate! Kate. O, la! [They go out. SCENE III. âThe Bar and Parlour. Enter the Hostess, conducting Last, Mortice, and Mallet. Hostess. Walk in, good master Mallet. Gentlemen, Walk in, you're welcome. What will't please you have? We've choice for all, and nought but's of the best. Mallet. We'll taste your ale, good mistress Trusty. Hark! How does your pretty barmaid? Did you speak, As late you promised, a good word for me? Hostess. I did. Mallet. And was she pleased? Hostess. 'Tis hard to say When maids are pleased. When I myself was one, What most I seem'd was, oft, what least I felt. Mortice. Your ear, kind hostess.âGave you mistress Bess The message that I sent her? Hostess. Word for word. Mortice. What word did she return me? Hostess. Marry, none! Bess is a prudent wench. Maids' thoughts go cheap That can be had for asking! Little worth, Yet hoarded charily, great price they bring. I found it so myself when I was young. Last. A word, good mistress Trusty, when you're done. Hostess. I'm at your service, now, sir. Last. Handed you My gift to Bess? Hostess. I did. Last. And took she it? Hostess. She took it not.â'Tis here for you again. Presents to maids are earnest. Take they them, They next should take the donors. Had not I Thought so in my free days, I should have won A dower in gifts! You shall be served anon. Mortice. I guess you've come bad speed. Last. Hast thou come better? Mallet. The fault's our own. Love's not a game at law, Wherein the player is not he that stakes. I'll play my game myself, and ask sweet Bess To church to-morrow! Last. So will I. Mortice. And I. [They go out. [Bess crosses the stage after them with a tankard. Enter Hostess conducting Belmont and Wilford. Hostess. Walk in, walk inâI'll show you to a room. Wilf. And please you get my chamber ready straight; I will, at once, to bed. Hostess. I'll see to't, sir. He early goes to restâHe must be ill? Love-sick perhaps? There's comfort for him then, Like all his sex he'll soon get over that! Bel. Hostess! Hostess. Your will? Bel. I'd try your wineâIs't good? Hostess. The very best! Please you sit down, good sirs. [Places chairs and goes out. Bel. Still rapt as ever! Rouse thee, Wilford, rouse thee! Shake off this lethargy, and be a man! Take faster hold of hope! We'll find her yet. But should we fail, what then? Art thou to pine To death? This malady is of the head More than the heart. Believe it can be cured, Thou'lt find 'twill be so. Be thyself again! Be free! But once beheld may be forgot. Wilf. Yes, if a thing that any fellow hath! I may forget a diamond, can I find Another one as rich; but show me one That is the paragon of all the mine, And try if that's forgot, though seen but once! Say that but once I see a beauteous star, I may forget it for another star; But say but once I gaze upon the sun, And name the orb will blot its image out! Bel. But of a single draught of love to die! Wilf. Why not? There is your poison, strong and weak; One kind admits of antidoteâone not. One by the drachm, one by the scruple, kills: Another by the grainâfor not in bulk, But subtleness, the lethal virtue lies. So are there kinds in love! A dozen shafts May gall him, and the bounding deer run on,â But one shot home, behold he's down at once! Bess enters with wine, which she places on a table, at some distance from Belmont and Wilford; the former sees her at once, and regards her with an expression of fixed admiration âthe latter remaining in a state of perfect abstraction. Bel. E'er saw'st thou thing so fair? Wilf. What speak'st thou of? Bel. Yon maid that waits on us. Wilf. I've seen! I've seen! Bel. This is to dream! He sleepsâI'll wake him then. My pretty maid, Hand thou the cup to yonder gentleman. [Bess, whose eyes have just fallen on Wilford, stands gazing upon him, apparently insensible to everything else. What ails the girl? Does she not hear? She's fix'd As statue to the pedestalâwhat is't She gazes at? As I'm alive, 'tis he! Commend me to a sallow cheek! She's smit, If Cupid is a marksman! Maids, I've heard, Like books they weep over, the which, the more They're made to melt, the greedier they devour! See how she reads him! Marry, she will get The book by heart! Bess. 'Tis he! 'tis he! How's this? I feel at home the while I look on him! Seem near me hearts I know! I could believe The roof our own! I scarce would start, were now The door to ope, to see my father's face! Yet what is he to me? Acquaintance of My eyes, whom ne'er they met but once before! Bel. A shot! a shot! Cupid is in the vein! Bess. [Drawing her father's picture from her bosom.] How like! how like! how veryâvery like! There only wants a smile upon the lipâ I think the lip more sweet the smile awayâ Fie! 'tis my father's lip! My father, then, As often I have heard my mother say, Had newly won my mother's loveâI ween My mother then smiled too! Who ought to smile, If not the maid that's woo'd by him she'd wed? Her Bess will never wed! Bel. A sigh! Be sure The arrow 's home! Bess. Just now I felt at home, And now I feel a thousand miles from home! Things, strange before, are now still stranger grown, And he most strange of allâthe farthest off, The least expected ever to be nearâ The sight of whom brought home so near to Bess! What's Bess's home to him? He'd pass the door, And would not know she dwelt there! If he did, Would never thank the latch to let him in! He has a home, and friends that love him thereâ Friends that he loves. Poor Bess is far from home, Was never fartherânever half so far! Hostess. [without]. Why, Bess! what, Bess! Bel. How deep the maiden's trance. Hostess enters, and goes to her. Hostess. Why Bess, what ails thee, child? Bess. [Abstractedly.] Anon! anon! I'll do it this moment. Hostess. Do it! what wilt do? Bess. [Confused and hurriedly.] Whate'er you bid. Hostess. Why, what has happen'd to her! Look to the bar till I come back again. Why Bess, dost hear me, that thou dost not move? Bess. [Confused.] I'll go this momentâWhere am I to go? Hostess. The girl 's bewilder'd! âWhere am I to go!â Canst tell me what I said to thee just now? Bess. Thou saidst, I thinkâor I mistakeâthou saidstâ Thou saidstâperhaps I did not rightly hear; Thinking of one thing, one forgets at times Another thingâThou saidstâIt was not thatâ Nor thatâIn sooth, I know not what thou saidstâ Hostess. I knew't. I bade thee go and mind the bar. Bess. I'll do't. [Still looking in the direction of Wilford. Hostess. Thou'lt do't! and go'st thou not to do it? Yonder 's the barâWhy, Bess, thou art asleep! Thou dreamest! Rouse thee, Bess. Go, mind the bar. The girl 's not like herself! [Bess and Hostess go out severally. Bel. A point-blank shot! An entry this in Cupid's register! Lord Wilford, was't not noon with you just now? Wilf. Noon! Bel. Felt you not the sun? Wilf. The sun! what sun? Bel. I' faith a glorious one, but not so kind As that which shines by day; for not a beam It threw on aught beside. You were its earthâ The grateful earth unlikeâthe orb alone For which its light seem'd made; absorbing it, Without so much as e'en a smile, to show You knew't from very darkness! Wilf. You are merry; And I can only wonder that you are,â As sickness doth, that health can feed, while she Herself from rarest viands loathing turns! It is not fancy; or, if fancy 'tis, 'Tis such as breeds realityâas, from Imagination only of disease Disease itself will grow. Do I but dream? Say that the anguish of a probÃ©d wound Is but a dream!âSay he that writhes in fire Is fancy-hauntedâjust as much am I! See'st not my fever? Is't not in mine eye? My cheek? if not, my pulse will show it thee! For if its throb be not the counter one To that which haleness knows, 'tis anything But index of my heart! Hostess enters. Hostess. Ho! Bess, I say! Enter Bess, who is immediately perceived by Wilford, and meeting his eye, stands as transfixed. Why, Bess, how's this? Is't true thou wast o'erheard To one, to two, and three, to give consent, When ask'd to be a wife? Art thou not pledged To marry Ralph? Wilf. Is she to be a bride? Bel. Are you awake? Wilf. I am! I am!âas one, That long at sea pines till he's sick, for land, And, ever dreaming on't, starts up at last, With the rebound which says his bark has struck, And drowns in sight and very reach of it! Bel. Is that the maid? Wilf. It is. Now wonder at me! Wouldst thou not ask, sprang ever that from earth? Look there, and think of an anatomy! Can lurk the canker death in such a cheek? Is not that flower imperishable, as It lodged the virtue of the feignÃ©d one, Which never diesâin poet's song yclept The immortal amaranth! Is she to be A bride? I'll speak to her! Bel. Thou'rt mad! Wilf. And if I am, Then once at least is madness rational. Being what I am, not to be mad as I, Were to be kindred to the cloddish brute, That looks at her and knows not what it sees!â Prevent me not! Art pledged to any one? Art thou to be a bride? Say yes or no. Hostess. Speak, Bess! Say yes! Thou know'st thou'rt pledged to Ralph! Enter Ralph. Maids, sir, you know, are coyâgive me thy hand. Thereâart thou now content? [Places her hand in Ralph's without her being conscious of it. Wilf. Content!âEnough! O'ermeasure on't! I've done,âYet would I touch The precious thing, so much I've coveted, Was ne'er till now in reach ofânow, so nearâ Find can ne'er be mine!âWhoe'er thou art, Thou art acquaintance of my heartâas soon As seen, beloved! I saw thee only once, That once too oft!âFor then I thought upon My marriage-bell, and wish'd it might be thine, But now, when thine they ring, they ring my knell! 'Tis not a crime to kiss thy hand, while yet The banning of the priest forbids me not. There! Let thy bridegroom at the altar set, In presence of the watching cherubim, A truer seal upon thy lip than that I've fixed upon thy handâthough his shall last Till doomsday! Take me hence! 'Tis hard to look At what we wish were ours, and while we do't, Persuade ourselves it cannot be.âTake me hence! The only sight of her is hold too strong For me to struggle 'gainst! It pulls me towards her! I feel as though she'd suck my vision in! My breath! my life!âI cannot quit her! [Breaks from Belmont and rushes towards her. Ralph interposes. Wilford seems to have lost all power over himself. Belmont approaches him to lead him out; but, when at the wing, he turnsâ gazes distractedly upon Bess. Lost! [Rushes out, followed by Belmont, and at the same moment Bess sinks senseless on the shoulder of Ralph. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âThe Front of the Queen's Arms. Enter Peter from the Inn, singing. A white gown and girdle, A knot of the same; And come to our wedding, Both damsel and dame! Peter. A charming day! A most pleasant day! and pleasant and charming work tooâwork fit for such a day! Right excellent work! Wedding and feasting! The feasting for me; the wedding for them that like it. For mine own part, holding the sex to be a provocative to wrath, which is sin, I'd sooner hang than wed! But for the feastingâthere I'm your man! Roast, boiled, or fried, was never the dish that couldn't warrant me the smoothest-temper'd fellow in Christendomâwith the special provision that there was enough on't. I wouldn't say as much of a cup, for a cup is a thing that a man of very oil and sugar will sometimes quarrel over; but, from ale to sack, I defy any man living to say he ever saw me quarrel with my cupâbarring the liquor was bad, or the cup empty. If I'm not the man for a feast, then never man sat down to one. I could feast it you seven days out of the week, and let him that can, do more. Nay, were there eight days in the week, and the week nothing the longer, I could feast it to the eighth day too. So the good cheer sha'n't lag for me. [Sings. Your bran new jerkins, gallants don, Or jerkins new, as you may; But the gallant whose mood is not o' the best, Were best to stay away. I'll give them a song. Marry, that can I, when I am tuned to the pitch. I'm none of your sober singersâyour trollers of long-winded ballads with a burden to them. I hate your burdens! To be outsung by every knave that has three notes upon his voice. I like to sing alone; but then it must be when the liquor has tuned me to the pitch. Your liquor's a marvellous fine master of singing. When I'm tuned to the pitch, I'd like you to show me the man that can sing better, or the song that's too many for me. Nay, though I know not the air, I'll put one to it. I'll sing them a songânone of your ditties, such as my old master used to grumble. In love fair Celia fell, O, With alas! and O! and a well-a-day! And her love the maid would tell, O,â Love comes and goes like sun in May! Above your reach ten feet, O, With alas! and O! and a well-a-day! A pear's ten times as sweet, O,â Love comes and goes like sun in May! The youth he loved the maid, O, With alas! and O! and a well-a-day! But to woo her was afraid, O,â Love comes and goes like sun in May! But when her love she told, O, With alas! and O! and a well-a-day! His love grew wondrous cold, O,â Love comes and goes like sun in May! My moral would you find, O, With alas! and O! and a well-a-day! No maid should tell her mind, O,â Love comes and goes like sun in May! Enter Old Small as off a Journey. Old S. I thank thee, fortune! Kind art thou to me! He's here! He's here! Why, who should sing that strain If not the varlet knave he took with him? That can't be he! Peter. [Aside.] My master's father here! Old S. Good sir,â Peter. [Aside.] All's right. He knows me not. Old S. I pray, Heard you a strain just now? Peter. I know not what you call a strain. I heard a varlet trying to play a tune upon his nose, which I could have pulled for him, 'twas so villanously ill done. If you call that a strain, let never man sing a strain to me! I know when I hear a strain. In a strain there is measure of time, which is the main part of it; measure of tune, which is no indifferent part of it; and measure of voice, which, though it rank not with either of the former, is yet allowed to be a part: but here was neither measure of time, tune, nor voice, but measure enough of the lack of them. If playing a tune upon the nose be a strain, why then I heard a strain just now; but whip me if I'd stand to hear such strain again. Old S. This could never be he. Peter. [Aside.] He eyes me hard. Old S. One question more, good sir. What kind of man was he you heard sing? Peter. What! your nose-tuner? Why, a tolerable sufficient manânay, a very sufficient man; say he had the dress of one. Old S. How was he dressed, I pray you? Peter. Marry, with cap, jerkin, hose, and shoes; but the cap was out at the crown, the jerkin was out at the elbows, the hose were out all over; and as for the shoes, it would tax a conjurer to find out why he wore them, for the uppers were the most that remained of them, and they were out at the toes. Shirt had he none, or he showed it not; doublet had he ever, his jerkin must have eaten it up; for it was a most incontinent oneâa devourer of all kinds of clothâcoarse, middle, fine, and superfine! and of all colours, a superlative sample of patchwork, a very nosegay of a jerkin, saving the odour on't. If he was a gentleman, he was a gentleman in jest; if he was a beggar, he was a beggar in earnest. Service he could never have had; for bowels of flesh and blood could not have committed it, to put a human body into such rat's livery. Old S. My scarecrow Peter, to a certainty. Enter Young Small from the Inn. Peter. My master! In, sir! in! Young S. Why, what's the matter? Old S. [To Peter.] Worthy sir,â Peter. Anonâ Young S. My father! Peter. Fear not,âKnows he not 'tis I. Young S. Nay, if he finds us out, my fortune's ruined! Peter. Stay! and I'll rid you of him in a trice. Old S. Pray you, what gentleman is that? Peter. Gentleman! Ne'er saw you a lord before? Old S. Is he a lord? Peter. Is he a lord!âLook at him! Is he not a lord? Not your lord mayor, forsoothâa lord to-day, a master to-morrow; but an every-day lordâa lord, and no thanks to you; nay, an he halt at the third hob-nail, yet shall he be a lord. Avoid him, or carry your cap in your hand. He takes measure of state upon him. If you take the wall of him, you may chance to take from the wall to the stocks. It happened no later than yesterday; though, truth to say, the youth was a forward oneâ one of your care-for-noughts from the cityâa fellow that would hector it like a prince, though, six days out of the seven, I warrant you, his father wipes his beard with an apron. Old S. What! put he him in the stocks? Peter. Ay did he; and from the stocks into prison, whence if he be not transferred to the gallows, he has more luck than grace. Old S. How angered he the lord, I pray you? Peter. Marry, as I said, he took the wall of him; whereat the lord commended the wall to his head; which he not relishing, commended his hand to the lord's cheek; who thereupon commended his body to the stocks, and thence to the prison; whence, when he is delivered, 'twill be upon a release in full, signed by the sheriff, and executed by the hangmanâfor he is a great lord. Old S. Alack! so it should seem, sir!âKnow you, sir, the name of the youth? Peter. I heard it, but have forgotten it, and yet have I a memory; but 'twas a very patch of a name. One good substantial name would make three such. 'Twas something like Spratâorâ Old S. 'Twasn't Small? Peter. Small was the name! Old S. Alack, sir, 'tis my son! Peter. Thy son!âAvoid!âAvoid! Safety for thee lies henceâhere, danger! Shares he thy blood, and shalt thou not share his punishment? Would he have transgressed but for thee, who but for thee had never lived to transgress? Shall he on whom treason is fathered hang, and the father of the traitor go free? Avoid, I say! Begone! Fine awaits thee! Imprisonment awaits thee! A halter awaits thee! Old S. Might I but have speech Of that fair lord? Good sir, hast thou his ear? Look, here are twenty pieces,âspeak for me, And call them thine! Peter. 'Twould nought avail! Old S. Good sir, I'll make the twenty thirty! Take them, sir! Good thirty pieces only for a word! Come, then, I'll make the thirty forty! What! Won't that suffice? What will, then? Sir, you see A poor old man that has an only son. Whom he, in evil hour, let go from him, Thinking that he could live without him, till The task he tried, but found too hard a one! Then choice had none except to follow him, Or stay at home and die! and here is come To Romford all the way from London, sir,â On foot, sir!âTake the forty pieces, sir!â Nay, then, take fifty!âsixty!âall I have! And only speak a good word for my son. Young S. Peter, thou'st spoil'd it all! Ne'er heed! ne'er heed! Thy son is not to hang. [Speaking with his back towards Old S. Old S. O thanks for that! But he's in prison. Ope the door for him, Although to close't on me! I'll take his place: Perhaps, of right, I should. I held the lash And reinâIf he's refractory or rash, Why is he so, but that I used them not? He better were, had he been better train'dâ That he's not so, his training bear the blame. That lies with me. Yet was my fault my loveâ My too fond love!âso fond, it could not see How duty could be harsh and yet be kind. Young S. Father! Old S. How!âWhat!âMy son! Ah, Thomas, Thomas, To pass thee on thy father for a lord! And who is this? Thou varletâknaveârank knave! [To Peter. Young S. Nay, father, well 'twas meant! Thou comest here To see great things. Old S. Is this a sample of them? What kind of jerkin's that for thee to wear? 'Twould suit a lord! And trunks to match withal, And doublet! Board and lodging for a life Thou carri'st on thy back! A cap and plume! Why, for what cobwebs, Thomas, hast thou changed Thy father's heavy crowns! What's that I see? Wear'st thou a rapier too! The end of time Is come! And thou, thou apeâfor nothing good But tricks! Thou mischief! Evil ne'er at rest! For whom the hide were clothing good enough! Are these my savings that so shine on thee? The which to keep, thy master's back more oft Went lacking, than provided! Cap and plume For thee!âA halter for thee!âSirrah! I'll to town Again. No hope! No help! Discomfort all! Care lost! Love wasted! Thomas, fare thee well! I shake thy hand, in bitterness, I do! I'll strive to live without thee!âTo what use? I tried, and couldn't do't. [Falls on his neck. Young S. Take not on so! Or I'll take on. In sooth I will! I'm not A stoneâa lump of flintâa piece of steel. Let our apparel passâor note it but For joy!âfor very joy! Thou hast a son That's born to fortune!âto high fortune! Know, To-day's my wedding day! Old S. Thy wedding day! Young S. My wedding day. Old S. And who's to be thy bride? Young S. A lady. Old S. How! Why, wherewithal hast thou To keep a lady? Young S. Keep a lady! No; Sufficient 'tis, methinks, I marry her. My lady shall keep me. How say you now! My lady's blood! She's one that comes of kinâ That looks for lands and coffersâthat is heir To titles! Wonder not though thou shouldst have A baron to thy grandson! Close accounts, And shut up shop! Old S. I'm all amaze! I'd like To see thy bride. Young S. Thou shalt, but not to speakâ For, though thy son for gentle state was born, Who looks on thee, saw he a counter e'er, Bethinks him of a shop; so mightst thou mar My fortune. Old S. Knows she not thy father's calling? Thomas! nought prospers like plain-dealing, son! But make thy fortune thy own wayâthou ne'er Wouldst follow mine! Young S. Content thee, father, that My fortune's made! E'en follow us to church; But not a word until the knot be tied, And I be fast and sure a gentleman! Hoa, Kate! Sweet Kate! E'er saw you lady, father? You now shall look on one! The form of lady, The air of ladyâface of ladyâyea The eyes, nose, mouth, and cheeks of lady. Kate! Come forth, my bride! Kate. [Coming to the door.] Who calls? Young S. Your bridegroom, Kate. To church! to church! Kate. Before my bridemaid comes! Young S. Thy bridemaid, Kate, is not to marry thee, But I, and I am here! so loiter not, The sexton's part is doneâthe doors are oped! The clerk is ready with his horn and pen; The parson's gown'd, and standing by the book; The merry bells are on the watch to ringâ There want but thee and me; so come to church! Kate. Without a bridemaid, I should be ashamed! Young S. How delicate! Your bridemaid yonder comes; So come, my lady Kate! Kate. Heigho! Young S. How sweet! Lean on me, Kate. Kate. I fear to take thy arm. Young S. How elegant! Nay, Kateâ Kate. But if I mustâ Young S. How like a lady doth she carry her In all things! Bear up, Kate; Take courage, Kate! Come on! Now warrant me a gentleman! [They go out. Music without.âEnter Wilford and Belmont. Wilf. Love plies the rack on which itself is stretch'd! Tell it of solace, and 'twill talk of pain, Which 'tis its piteous profit to augment! So far unlike, love's merchant is to him That trades for pelf. He hears his venture's sunk, And cries, â'Tis gone!ââtries to forget his lossâ Hoists up fresh hope, and launches other freight. No other freight for him that trades in love! His venture haply founder'dâno new hope;â His dreamy day of speculation's done! His breast hath room for nothing, but the thought How many fathom deep his treasure lies! He has no use for life, except to make Its cheek a feast for comfortless despair; Nor ever smiles again, except to see How fast it wastes away! Bel. The lover's tune! Wilf. They come to carry her to church! To own The happy hand she'll take to lead her there, Would I forego the clasp of Fortune's own, And all her gifts of rank and wealth refund! Bel. Yet gave she these in kindness. By their means Your love might prosper yet. What need you do, But doff this sordid guise, appear yourself, And ask and have her? Wilf. No! not even her For their deserts!âMyself! What's of myself That is not here? Call I the prouder suit I should put onâmyself? Call I my title, No merit of mine own achievedâmyself? They're nought of me but what a knave might wear As well as I! My ardent soul's myself!â My heart, too proud to be in fortune's debt, Where worth, alone, should winâmyself! My mind That its chief store by nature's riches sets With this its vassal case, such as it isâ Myself!âThe only self I'd use or thank To win me love or friend! So end my part What it began! I'll look once more upon her! [Retires with Belmont. Enter Ralph and Hostess, meeting. Hostess. Ralph, where's thy bride? Ralph. She's in her chamber still. Hostess. Then bring her forth. Ralph. She will not come for me. Hostess. For what Delays she thus? Her bonnet's trimm'dâHer coif She hasâI sent her in her wedding-gown An hour ago, I'm certain 'twas a fit! I'll fetch her forth myself. [Enters the house. Enter Young Small and Kate, followed by Old Small and Peter. Young S. Joy! Give me joy! Ralph. How, sir;âso soon at church! The knotting done! Young S. E'en so, good master Ralph!âFather, my brideâ Kate. Thy father! Young S. Even so, my pretty Kate! The father of thy Thomas! Let him know From thy own tongueânor him, alone, but all men, The kind of wife his Thomas, whom he thought A foolâan assâa ne'er-do-wellâhath won. Kate. And thought thy father ever thus of thee? Young S. No matter what he thought! Convince him, Kate, What now, and ever hence, behoves him think. Father and friends, my wife. Now, Kate, disclose Thy kin, my Kateâthy kin, my lady Kate? Kate. Anan? Young S. Anan! Thy kin? Kate. Anan? Young S. Thy kin? Thy house? thy family? thy pedigree? Kate. Anan? Young S. Anan again! Whence drawest thou thy noble blood, my Kate? How comest it to thee? Is it by the male Or female side? The lands thou'rt heiress toâ The titles that shall fall to thee?âIn right Of whom expectest them? Enter Strap, half tipsy. Strap. Fine doings here! A wedding! So!âI'll thank you for a knot For honest master Strap. Young S. Peace, fellow!âPeace! The knotting's done. Strap. O then the bride's a wife. No doubt, good sirs, you've all had kisses round; So now my turn is come. Sir, by your leave! Young S. Out, knave! Thou art full of ale. Strap. A lucky day For thee, when thou art full of aught so good! I say I'll have a kiss. Young S. What art thou? Strap. What? A cobbler. Young S. What!âA fellow kiss my wife, That is not master even of a craft! Strap. That shows thy wisdom! Cobbling is the chief Of crafts. Young S. The chief!âYou hear him, masters! Chief Of craftsâI question if the half of one!â Yea, third of one! A cordiner's a craft; He makes the shoe, the cobbler only mends, And so's no better than a patch, a botch, A nail, a tack, a stitchâA cobbler!âWhat! A cobbler kiss my wife!âan awlâa piece Of wax and packthreadâand the bristle of A hogâand there's a cobbler! Hark thee, Kate? Couldst bear of such a lout to take a kiss? No! never common gentlewoman could! Far less, a dame of title, and by birth. Strap. Young man, a sober word or two with thee: Thou'rt drunk, or madâor bothâThou knowest not What cobbling is! 'Tis part of every trade, And the chief part,âNo trade but hath its cobbler. Your law hath cobblers, your divinity, Your surgery, your physic. There are cobblers In merchandise and war. Who does not know What cobblers are there 'mongst your politicians? If that should be a craft which is most follow'd, Then cobbling is a craftâAy, chief of crafts. Young S. Well hast thou argued it! yet provest thou not Thy right to kiss my bride? Strap. Of new-made bride 'Tis right of any one to take a kiss; So prithee stand aside.âNay, wilt thou not, Thou'lt learn, belongs he to a trade or not, A cobbler is a man! But noâno broil Upon a wedding-day. That were not like A cobbler! Comeâa bargain, sirâI'll leave it To your lady. Young S. Gives she leave, you're welcome, sirâ Small likelihood of that! Strap. Fair lady!âwhat! Slut! hussy! vixen! wanton! cockatrice! Young S. How, knave? Strap. Knave!âShe's the knave! Prevent me not. I'll call her what I list, sirâWhat I list I'll do to her. [Embraces her.] Make rosin of her!âpack-thread! Nail her unto a last, for bridegroom!âTake Strap, hammer, pincers to her!âturn her Into thongs and shoe-strings!âWherefore should I not, That am her father! Young S. What? Strap. O run-away! Oh, vixen! mad-cap! Oh, my daughter, Kate, And have I found thee? Kate. Father, I'm marriedâ And married unto a gentleman! Strap. [Seeing Old Small.] Odzooks! Good master Small!âFactor of minikins And corking-pinsâof pins of all degrees!â Hearing that thou hadst traced thy thriftless child To Romford here, and having lost my own, Good fortune put it in my crazy pate To follow thee,âand lo! what speed I've come! My daughter's foundâand doubly found!âShe says She's married to a gentleman!âHast found Thy son? Old S. Yes, master Strap, he's there. Strap. This he! So, sirrah! jackanapes! And have I craved Thy leave to kiss thy bride? Scorn'st thou me now? And if thou dost, thou art my son-in-lawâ Yea, thou art married to a cobbler's daughter. But what of that? If not a gentleman, A cobbler is the king of jolly fellows! Ralph. Kate! shall I now doff cap unto thy spouse? Kate. Yes; if thou dost what fits thee, best, to do. Ralph. Thy gentleman hath dwindled to a pin! Kate. A pin that's worth a bush of thorns, like thee! Ralph. Give you much joy, good sir! You've wed your match; Who doubts it, let him!âI will swear thy bride A ladyâmuch as thou'rt a gentleman! Nay, frown notâ [Good-humouredly. Young S. Frown! who ever saw me frown? I have lost all day at loggats, and I'd thank The man, could say, he ever saw me frown! Come, Kate!âCome, fathers both. Kate. Wilt take me, sir? Young S. Take thee! Have I not taken thee? I willâ And keep thee too, so thou wilt let me, Kate. [Young Small, Kate, Old Small, Strap, and Peter retire. Enter Hostess from house. Hostess. I vow the girl's bewilder'd! âYesâ and âno,â And ânoâ and âyes,â are all you get from her! Nor, yet, will she come forth.âIs that her step? It is. She comes. Enter Bess, dressed as the Beggar's Daughter. Why, Bess, are you not dress'd? In trim like that went ever bride to church? Ralph. Trim good enough for me. Come then, my bride; Come, pretty Bess! Your hand to go to church! Bess. I go not, sir, a bride, to church with you. Wilf. [Aside.] Hope, hearty friend! art thou come back to me! I see thee, yet can scarce believe I do, So sure I thought we had for ever parted! Welcome, O welcome! Hostess. Gavest thou not consent To marry Ralph? Bess. Consent I could not give! Your heart imagined, only, what it wish'd, In single, earnest generosity! The hand he covets, others' rights demand Disposal ofâI have parents. Ralph. Where are they? Bess. Alas! I know not; but I go to seek them! Ralph. Who are thy parents then, my pretty Bess? Tell me, sweet Bess? Hostess. Sweet Bess, thy father's name? Ralph. What is thy father? Bess. The Blind Beggar, sir, Of Bethnal Green. Young S. You see I might have wed A beggar, father. Give me praise for that, My Kate, a kiss! Come to our wedding cheer! [Young Small, Kate, Old Small, Strap, and Peter go out. Ralph. Sweet Bess, hadst thou for father, craftsman low As low can be, I should be well content To call him father, too; a beggar, though, Is father none for me. [Ralph goes out. Hostess. Hold up thy head, My pretty Bess! Thou'rt bride too good for him! Above his mark! Shame on them! shame! I would I knew the man were worth thee, Bess. Wilf. What kind Of man were he? Hostess. Why, likely, such as thou, For looks!âThough I've seen better.âMet we not Before?â'Amercy!âYesternight we did, When thou wast raving of knells, and wedding-bells! For love of Bess! Art now in raving mood? Or have thy wits, last night, a roaming gone, Return'd with this fair morning? Come, confess, Thou'rt brother to my son! Wilf. Of none, good dame, Who slight that maid! Hostess. What! wouldst thou take her, then? Wilf. Not take her, dame! Hostess. I knew't. Wilf. You're over quick! You stop my speech, nor know the way 'twould run! Hostess. 'Twould run? It runs, I wot, no other way Than that of half thy sex, when they find out A woman's dower's herself! Wilf. You wrong me, dame! Hostess. Why, said you not you would not take the maid? Wilf. I grant I did; butâ Hostess. But! Give me no buts! Say downright no at once!ââbut thisâbut that; You love usâbut! You'd wed usâbut!â As much You'd love as you would wed! You'd wed, be sure, If sure you loved! Yet you do love, you say, But cannot wed,âand love, indeed you do; Butâin your own coin, to be quits with you, You love her not for herself! Wilf. I'faith, not so! And to convince you that your thought doth hold The counter-course to that my wishes steer, I'll say I'd take the maid; butâ Hostess. There! Wilf. Nay, peace! Thwart not my soul, of which to judge the love, Thou must partaker of its essence be. Take her!âTake fortune, honours, fame!âThey're things We hunt for!âThey're the eager chase that so Inspirits us,âdespite its length, its stops, Its perils, its escapes, and accidents,â We keep it up with cheer!âand what are these To this excelling maid?âI would not takeâ For that were to suppose a thing obtain'd, Untoil'd, and unadventured forâI'd win her! Hostess. And worthy were to win! How say you, Bess? Wilt thou to church be led by him? Nor âno,â Nor âyes?â I marvel what a maid would say, Who, when she's ask'd to church, but hangs her head! Is't âno?âââNo,â Bess?âAn angel to a crown 'Tis âno!â but ânoâ to âno,â that answers âno.â Sweet Bess, hadst e'er thy fortune read to thee? Show me thy hand. How white a thing it is! What's here? Here's line, and line, and ne'er a crossâ A lucky hand! Look! Saw you e'er the like? Methinks this hand betokeneth a maid Not like to wedâfor wedlock's still, you know, The cross of womankind! She'll never wed! You think she will, I see, and doubt my skill? Then try your own, and read the hand yourself. [Puts Bess's hand into Wilford's. Wilf. This precious hand, had I the skill to read, Great as the will, and nuptials it foretold, Ne'er destined e'er be mine, I'd wish it well! Though what built up its hope, made wreck of mine! If adverse was its promise!âlucklessness Through life,âunpurchased foes,âunstable friends,â Afflictions,âbeggary, in allâbut loveâ And I the one to keep thee rich in that!â 'Fore hands, with fortune's fairest pledges writ, I'd covet thine, and for that only gift, Compound for all beside! Didst press my hand? Thou didst!âThou didst!âDeny it not, while stands That glowing witness on thy modest cheek, To back my tongue! Love's joyous day is come! And that's the dawn, or never yet did beam His golden sun on earth! And I to be Its harbinger to her! Come, let us seek Thy parents! Rich enough are they for me, Whose blessing leaves me not a wish to bless! Lord Tomas Willoughby enters with Attendants. Will. 'Tis she! For once hath rumour spoken truth! [Aside. Base hind, forbear, nor lock thy arms on one Thy knee were much too graced to wait uponâ And straight resign to me my peerless bride; For know, whom thou esteem'st a beggar's child, Is daughter to a baron of descent, The highest in the land. Wilf. A baron's child! And bride of thine! Bess. Oh, no!âNo baron's child! My father is a wandering beggar-man! I would not be a baron's child:âyea, child Unto a kingâand least of all be bride to him! Will. I swear thou art a baron's child;âI swear Thou art my bride;âSuch gives thee out the tongue, Whose word is law, 'twere treason to dispute! Wilf. What say'st thou, Bess? Bess. I'm bride to none but thee! Thou that wouldst wed me, though a beggar's child, Were I a baron's child, shouldst wed me still! Take mind for mind, and heart for heart from me! I saw thee, and I loved thee!âGrows my tongue Too bold?âForgive it for the bashfulness That could not pay thy love with one poor word, Until another dared dispute with thee What eye, and ear, and heart, and soul, and all Bear witness is thine own!âWhere are thine arms? Or didst thou mock me, calling me their treasure? [Wilford clasps her in his arms. Will. [Drawing his sword.] Forbear, I say!âThy life's in jeopardy! Lo! the commands of her whose will behoves The proudest not to question. [Gives a paper. Wilf. [Reading.] What, to thee! Convicted here of violence, Offer'd to her, thou now wouldst make thy bride! Not for the queen will I resign her to thee. [Drawing too. Will. You talk it mightily! Wilf. I'll do it too. Look you,âa man will let one take his life, Ere he'll give up his purse, and that, perhaps, Will hold a score of crowns! It hath been done For less! Come, state the sum thou'dst set against her! What's its amount? Come, name't. Couldst borrow it From usury? Couldst find it in the mint? In that which feeds the mintâthe unwasting mine? Couldst eke it out with diamonds, and the rest Of all the brood of gems? Couldst fancy it?â And shall I give her up, that have the right To keep her? Never with my will! She's mine! You see she is! You see her choice no less Holds her to me, than do the arms, my soul, With force of thousand arms, now locks upon her. Advance an inch, thy life's not worth a straw! Hostess. A spark! A spark among a thousand! Take His word, good sir, he's one that says and does! The man for me I'd wed, were I a maid! [Music without. Will. Abide the cost of your rebellion, slave! The queen herself is here! [March. Procession as before: Queen, &amp;c. Queen dismounts. Queen. Ha, swords without their cases! Who is she That so our vision dazzles, distancing All it hath seen of nature's cunning'st fairness? Ha!âYou that have the charge of him, lead forth The Beggar of Bethnal Green. Bess. My parents! Al. and Emma. Bess! Queen. I knew it must be she. Hast found her, sir? The star that look'd upon thy birth was fair; For, had she been, indeed, a beggar's child, She yet had been thy bride. The truant ring That late betray'd thee, still was faithful to thee! This hour, your nuptials shall be solemnized! Bel. Contain thyself!âHer hand she'll never give. Wilf. Does sheâshe may! Refuses she, let him That dares, attempt to take it! Hostess. Hold to that; I would were I a man! Queen. Yet,âere we tax The labour of the priest,âher parents' rank, To me and to this lord, alone, divulged, Befits it others know. That document Which to our hand her father late confided, [To Attendant. Paper is brought, Queen reads. Lord Woodville read; and say, concerns thee aught This history? [Giving him the paper. Wood. It does! If truth it speaksâ Which doubt I notâthe beggar is my brother; A brother, who, when living, ne'er from me Received a brother's right, but hate for love; And yet whose death to love converted hate. Alb. Octavius! Wood. Albert! Alb. Brother! Wood. O forgive, And with thy lands receive thy brother back! [They embrace. Queen. My chaplain, ho! Come tie the knot! Wilf. I have a feeling now Of what it is to dieâthe heavy pause, Ere life goes out! Queen. What wait you for, sir priest? Chaplain. Her hand to give, the maid refuses. Queen. How! Wilf. She does! She's true! She's mine! Queen. Who's he that speaks? Wood. A peasant, please your majesty! Will. A hind, Your grace, who claims my bride! Wilf. Thy bride? She's mine! Prize of my love, proud lord! that coveted Her love when she was low, as now she's high, And won it!âwon it!âwon, what all thy gold, Thy lands, thy honours, thy alliances, Could never win for thee!âwhat, peasant as I am, makes me the peer, that would not change Condition with thee, wast thou twice as high! Hostess. A spark to win a woman! Will. Villain, hence. Wilf. Proud lord, I fling the foul term back at thee! Nor call thee villain mere, but traitor foul! Who knew'st thy mistress was a virgin queen, Yet strovest to rob a virgin of her pride, By villain force! Ha! do I make thee blench? Cower'st thou before me, peasant though I am? Has not the blood of all thy noble line The power to hearten thee, and make thee stand Erect in presence of the nameless brow That's bent upon thee with an honest scowl? Command'st me hence?âHence rather thou, and learn Whose merits, mean, behind their titles lag Were better go undubb'd,âwhilst lowest hind That's lord of noble deed, is lord enough! Queen.

If nature marketh blood, Then is the peasant of condition fair, As any in your court!âIf to be highâ If to be truly gentleâbe to shine; In valiant bearing, generosity, Love, which the eye of fortune follows not For guidance where to smile,âa noble and The noblest noble should the peasant be!

Queen. It must not be! Al. Most gracious queen, a picture wears my child, The likeness of her father ta'en in his youth; Command her show it you. Queen. That picture, girl! [Bess gives the picture. Feature for feature 'tis the peasant's own!â A light breaks in upon meâMy Lord Woodville, Where is that truant son of thine, we wont In sport to dub our hero of romance? Wood. Your grace, an age it is since I have seen him. Queen. Enough! a pretty masque it is, they play! I'll try the mettle of her constancy. [To Bess. Give me this bauble, and that other one Thou wearest in thy heart, throw far from it; For, by our title to the crown we wear, We vow no peasant e'er shall call thee wife! Bess. RecallâRecall the vow! Queen. Recall thy heart, If thou hast given it him. Bess. I cannot do't. Queen. No? Bess. No! He is its ownerâmasterâlord! Yes, I avow it, peasant though he is!

'Tis but the peasant dies, To give thee, in a baron's noble heir, The lover whom thy constancy hath won!â Whose constancy hath rich reward in thee. Young lord, thou see'st how fortune, to revenge The wrong thou wouldst have done this noble maid, When thou esteemd'st her of low degree, Now that she proves fit partner for thy bed, Consigns her to another's worthier arms! [To Lord Thomas. We pardon thee thy trespasses, atoned By loss of sight, and long privations borne. [To Albert. Lord Woodville, join thy niece to thine own son, For there indeed he stands; and greetings spare, Until we see their nuptials solemnized; Which we ourselves under our conduct take. Pageant and masque shall grace their wedding-day, And poets vie while they rehearse the tale Of Bess, the beggar's maid of Bethnal Green! END OF THE BEGGAR OF BETHNAL GREEN.</field>
