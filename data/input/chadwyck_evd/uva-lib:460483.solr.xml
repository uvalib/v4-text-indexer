      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —The Cave of Kabyla, the Lady of the Woods. Roots of trees interlace each other and form a wild and fanciful ceiling; six rudely-formed human figures occupy the side of the scene. Kabyla discovered at a fantastic dressing table making her toilet; a bed with crimson hangings in flat; Cuimoth and Zontoma attending her. As the curtain rises, a Wild Music. Kab. How do I look? Zon. Oh! lovely as a queen, Though your complexion seems a shade too green; This new cosmetic which I bought in town, Will tone its verdure delicately down. (applies wash) [During this dialogue, the Attendants of Kabyla are very obsequious. Cui. (brushing Kabyla's hair) Your hair my lady's getting rather dry, Some of the Russian balsam shall I try? Kab. Well, p'rhaps you may—yet no—upon the whole, Anything Russian's hurtful to the Pole; The very thought my nervous system shocks, O! would that mine were like Chubb's—safety locks! Should I turn grey, I'd bid the world good bye, Zon. If you turn grey it would be time to dye. Kab. Hast done? Cui. I've given the concluding frizzle, Kab. Then all of you except Zontamo mizzle. [Exeunt all except Zontoma and Kabyla, R. Come hither; look, Zontoma, in my face, You've been now near a twelvemonth in your place, Say, can I trust you? Zon. Wages overdue Will prove, my lady, that I've trusted you. Kab. Good girl, your sly reproof is rather just, We will be quits, I'll give you trust for trust. Now to my tale— Zon. Is it a long affair? Kab. 'Tis fifteen years— Zon. La! ma'am, pray take a chair. [Retires up. Kalyba takes out pocket glass, Zontoma places chair, C. During the above, the curtains of bed, L., are drawn aside and St. George pops out his head. St. Geo. This ain't my nursery, that's not old nurse, I'll listen—they're beginning to converse. Kab. Attend, Zontoma, unto what I say; 'Tis fifteen years ago this very day, I from his mother took an infant son, (appears affected) Zon. Why that's a thing, my lady, daily done. The law allows it— Kab. True, and so in fact I did but carry out a certain act. It was St. George I stole when he was teething, St. Geo. And I'm St. George! by George it stops my breathing. I must have had a very lengthy doze, I'm vastly grown, that fact my clothes disclose. Kab. Upon this boy his parents fondly doated, St. Geo. (aside) Well, mi! I've been excessively short coated. Kab. To-day the spell which binds him I must break, St. Geo. I feel that I'm already wide awake. Zon. What made you steal the boy? Kab. (rises) You're very green, Old maids lead apes in—you know where I mean. My lease is out to-day, should I not marry I'm claimed at twelve o'clock by ancient Harry! This young St. George must fall in love with me, Having no other woman met you see. Zon. That you may say, without appearing vain, Kab. I think I'm very clear— St. Geo. You're very plain. Kab. Those senseless blocks of stone, unhappy wights, (rises) I think you know all in their days were knights; I loved them all, but they were stone to me, And so I petrified them as you see. My final chance on young St. George I stake— Be thou unmesmerised—St. George, awake! [Music. The curtains draw aside and discovers St. George, who affects to be asleep and afterwards to awake. St. George comes forward; he wears a frock and trowsers with a coral hung round his neck. St. Geo. (L. aside) How to proceed, I'm sure I'm puzzled quite, Kab. (aside) The pretty darling loves me at first sight; My maiden heart no longer can withstand Those looks of love, so Georgy, there's my hand. St. Geo. I must dissemble, for I freely own I've no desire to be done in stone. (takes her hand) I'm yours, sweet maid, but still I needs must tarry, Is this a dress for “one about to marry?” Kab. (produces a wand) You see this little wand, a perfect treasure, Which can produce cheap clothing without measure. [Music. She touches St. George; his dress strips and shews him in a splendid suit of armour. Zontoma places a helmet on his head, and girds on the sword, &amp;c. Kab. Thus armed, thro' ev'ry danger you may pass, St. Geo. I feel as bold as London's ‘man in brass.’ (crosses to R.) Kab. (points off R.) You see those horses, either you may own, They once belonged to yonder knights of stone; St. Geo. Could you the horses and their riders spare They're sadly wanted in Trafalgar Square: The place at present looks extremely queer, What you would call a pig with but one ear. Kab. Yon living charger I design for thee If you'll consent at once to marry me. St. Geo. I do consent, so that you don't object To grant what modern husbands now expect. Kab. Of course, my love! What may your wishes be? St. Geo. Oh! a cigar in-doors, and a latch key! Kab. The former is a secondary matter, But there's a deal of mischief in the latter. Latch keys cause men without restraint to roam; For there's no knowing when they do get home. Now then to lunch. [Music. Strikes rock, R. It opens and shews a redhot room. St. Geo. Dear me! How very odd! Allow me to inspect that wondrous rod. [Kabyla gives it to him. It beats Herr Döbler's conjurations hollow. Kab. Herr Döbler! Fiddlestick! Come, George! St. Geo. I'll follow. [Music. As Kabyla enters, St. George strikes rock. It closes. Most discordant music heard. St. Geo. And now, I think, your ladyship is done. [Chains fall. Noises, St. George waves wand. Silence that dreadful rock, Harmonicon. [Noise ceases. These finished gentlemen must quit this place. [Raps one of the figures with the wand; it sounds like stone. One can't imagine well a harder case. [Music. St. George touches each figure. Gong. The Six Champions of Christendom appear, and by action express their gratitude. The scene changes at the same time to THE BRAZEN PILLAR NEAR COVENTRY. There are your horses, six in number; count 'em; So quiet that an alderman might mount 'em. These seven roads, a sort of seven dials, Will lead you to your several knightly trials! And when again we altogether meet, We follow him who boasts the greatest feat. Are you agreed, Sir Knights? Knights. We are, we are. St. Geo. Then just one glass of grog and a cigar Before we part: I own I love the weed. Kni. And I. And I. St. Geo. Then for the road. Omnes. Agreed. SONG.—ST. GEORGE. Air—“Hurrah for the road.” Hurrah! on horseback, off we goes! Hurrah! the world we will scour; And if each knight but follows his nose, We shall do it in half an hour. So arm in arm we'll go down the street, Where our coursers are bestow'd, And the instant we our lunch complete Then hurrah! hurrah! for the road. [Exeunt R. and L. SCENE III. —Memphis. A throne on L. side. Enter dancers, preceding Ptolemy. Princess Sabra and Court from C. Cymbals, drums, Cannon, &amp;c. Pto. Silence! What! can't my majesty walk out, But after me you raise this horrid rout? Upon my daughter's nerves I'm sure it jars: The soldiers all seem bravos or hussars. Sab. You're right papa; I dread the cannon's roar: 'Tis the old dose, “the powder, as before.” A princess now, no matter if it suits her, Can't move, but some artillery man salutes her. [Guns, Trumpets, &amp;c. Enter Messenger, C. Pto. Those guns again! (to Messenger.) Well, Mister! where's the joke? Mes. Morocco's king is coming through the smoke. Pto. Morocco's king! Oh, how delightful is it To see two sovereigns one another visit! And you, my love! are you, too, not delighted, That the black king should come here unin-whited. Sab. I've not the least anxiety to greet him; He's nothing but black looks for all who meet him. Mes. Most beauteous princess! from my master this is. [gives a letter, and retires. Sab. [Shews letter, on which are two large red patches. How dare he with the wax make two large kisses. [Opens letter, and shews a black heart with an arrow in it. What's this? A valentine! He writes in vain; His doggrel verses not one point contain. But there's a rule commanded by his betters, That nothing pointed must be sent in letters. With one I lov'd, I'd share a second floor; But I've a horror of a blackymoor. Pto. He's rich and liberal, Miss, I understand: The nigger deals not with a niggard hand. [Music. During which enter Almidor and train. Pto. I bid you welcome, tell me how do you do? Alm. I'm Robertish or Bobbish, how are you? And you my princess, (one offers to take his banjo) Thank you, you're too good, Sab. (aside) I'd look as black as he does if I could. Alm. To you, dear Miss, I sent a billet doux, My heart you saw there skewered thro' and thro'. Accept my hand, which here I offer plump, My hand includes a heart, and that's a trump. Sab. I'm flattered by the preference you show, But to your offer I must answer, no! Alm. The presents you've received— Sab. Sir, if you'll call, They'll be left for you in the porter's hall. SONG.—Almidor. Air.—“My heart with love is beating.” My heart with love is beating, Like Drummer-boys at drill; And though with coldness meeting, It keeps tattooing still. My prospects, Miss, are fairish; I make my subjects pay. I swear to “love and cherish,” If you will say “obey.” [Trumpet.] Enter St. George, C. Pto. A stranger! if to you 'tis all the same, I'll thank you to oblige me with your name. St. Geo. My name's St. George— Pto. Indeed! whence do you come? Alm. That is, who are you when you are at home? St. Geo. Dear England, sire, I quitted to come here, Alm. Dear England! yes, I've heard it's rather dear! Pto. Why did you leave it? St. Geo. I can scarcely say. Alm. (sneeringly) The income tax he didn't want to pay; St. Geo. If that I would elude, it's very plain To England I must ne'er go back again. Alm. Nay, there's no knowing, wonders never end! For Pennsylvania's paid a dividend. I've also heard—don't let it be repeated, The bridge at Hungerford will be completed. Sab. (aside) I think that saint's a very charming fellow, [Sees Almidor watching her angrily. Ho! ho! King Blacky there is getting yellow. Pto. I hope your stay in Egypt won't be short, If fond of sporting, we can show you sport. If you would build we'll grant you ground on lease. St. Geo. I thank you—we've enough of absentees. [St. George points to Sabra. Alm. Zounds! at the Princess he presumes to point, Dares he to put a King's nose out of joint. St. Geo. Who is that lovely creature in the corner, The Graces have united to adorn her. Pto. The lady you admire, sir, is my daughter, St. Geo. Ah! she returns my glance, by George, I've caught her. Sab. I've made a conquest! (to Audience) does'nt he look killing? [St. George kisses his hand to her. Alm. (to Audience) Well, did you ever see a saucier villain. Pto. Let some one blow a trumpet! That will do, [Two obey. I said some one—now some one don't mean two. (sits) In honor of our guests, great Egypt's King Will pardon everybody, everything! [Omnes shout. Pto. Come speak! don't let our royal mercy wait— [The Chancellor of the Exchequer kneels. Cha. I've done a grievous wrong, sire, to the state. Pto. Our Chancellor of the Exchequer! well— Alm. (aside) If he's like mine, he'll have enough to tell. Cha. I have been paying, sire, for money lent— Pto. How much, sir, speak? Cha. Why, forty-five per cent. Pto. What borrow! when you've subjects, sir, to tax! Alm. Oh! that's a question which I often ax; My treasury ne'er a surplus has to brag on, Pto. (shaking Chancellor) Who dared to take this interest? Cha. Sire, the Dragon. Omnes. The Dragon! [Private Secretary kneels. Pto. What, my own Secretary! don't shake and shiver, But what you have to say, stand and deliver. What hast thou done? P. Sec. I've given a permission To any one to practice as physician; And poisons being sold in box and flaggon, By a quack doctor— Alm. Who's the quack? the Dragon. Omnes. The Dragon! Pto. (as Privy Purse kneels) More to be pardoned! This is worse and worse. Why, who is this? Aha! my Privy Purse! Alm. (aside to Ptolemy) Take my advice, and never trust your riches Out of the pockets of your royal—small clothes. Pto. Your majesty will please to cease this raillery. (To Privy Purse) What have you done? P. Purse. I've lost my quarter's salary. Pto. Ha! ha! Is that the worst, old boy, you have to tell? P. Purse. Oh, no! I've lost your majesty's as well! Pto. How lost it? Varlet, speak! or, dash my wig I'll call police. P. Purse. Great sire, at thimble rig. Pto. Proceed! At other times you fast can mag on. Whom did you play with? Ah! I see—the Dragon. Omnes. The Dragon? Ptol. I'll hear no more. This Dragon must be slaughter'd. (rises) Where hangs he out? Alm. He must be somewhere quartered. St. Geo. That task be mine, sire, by your kind permission. Pto. You've seen him? St. Geo. At the Chinese exhibition. P. Min. To ask fair Sabra's hand he vows he'll come. Sab. The brute! I'd rather marry Thomas Thumb. P. Min. Then the state's bankrupt, Ma'am! Alm. Let the state be— Hum! for the rest see Walker, letter D—. Pto. I'll not be treated in this shameful manner. What ho! A paint brush, and a snow-white banner (Music. They are brought. He writes.) My royal daughter's hand I offer down, And in addition to it half-a-crown. [A banner exhibited on which is written, “Half-a-crown and the Princess Sabra's hand to him. who does the Dragon!” Alm. What, only half-a-crown! That's rather mean. Pto. 'Tis Egypt's half crown, when my daughter's queen. I make this offer unto any one By whom the Dragon shall be fairly done, St. Geo. The lady's hand sure prize enough will be— (about to take Sabra's hand) Alm (interferes) Hollo! young man, you'll take that after me. DUETT. St. George and Almidor. St. Geo. I'll thank you to mention, if 'tis your intention, In that lady's affection my rival to be? For if it is, sir, I'll only say this, sir, Consider you're horsewhipp'd this moment by me. Alm. The lady has taste, sir, she'll ne'er be disgraced, sir, By wedding with one who's so horridly vain. So pray, sir, take warning, or else, some fine morning, 'Twill be pistols for two, so don't do it again. Both. Dont, &amp;c. [At the end of the Duett the people rush on in great alarm, crying out—“The Dragon!” Pto. Why has this sudden outcry, pray, arisen? P. Purse. The Dragon, sire, will put us all in prison. Alm. You're safe enough, and that on legal grounds, If all your debts are under twenty pounds. [A noise is heard without. Gong, &amp;c. And enter Dragon. All crowd together in fear, excepting St. George. Dra. Insolent crew! Well may ye run away! That which you owe me wherefore don't ye pay? The mildest Dragon 'tis enough to vex, I hold your bills returned—your unpaid cheques. (to Privy Purse) The only terms on which I offer quarter, Is money down, or else your monarch's daughter. Alm. You'll find a prior claimant, sir, in me, I'm in possession as the mortgagee. Dra. Sir, your pretensions are of no avail, For I can boast a tenancy in tail; And I'm entitled in another manner, I'll even take my stand upon the banner. St. Geo. Pooh! pooh! the offer's made to any one, By whom the Dragon shall be fairly done. Dra. That's an achievement I alone can brag on, I claim the prize, 'tis I that does the Dragon. Alm. The lovely maid was never made for you. Dra. What! dare you brave me? [They swagger. Dra., Alm. Cock-a-doodle-doo! FINALE. Dragon, Almidor, St. George, and Chorus. I'll soon let you see Your bragging's no go, sir; You shall pay for this raly, Altho' you're so scaly. Dra. As sure as I'm scaly I'll lay ten to one, sir, I'll soon make it clear, That, like Mister Ferguson, You don't lodge here. Chorus repeated. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —A Gaming House, the Dragon, as croupier, Almidor and others playing. Chorus. AIR AND CHORUS. Come boys, make your game, be steady, Faint heart ne'er won lady fair, Seven's the main, down with the ready, He's/I've thrown sixes I declare. Whilst the dice he's/I'm shaking, See what cash doth yet remain, What's the use of quaking, Here the ivories go again. Alm. I've lost again, what can the reason be? Dra. Now, make your game. [Dragon pulls in money. Alm. You're making game of me, Dra. Let's change the game—that table there be nimble. [A table and cups brought in. Alm. What's that? Dra. Why that's a rather large sized thimble This game's exceeding fair, as you will see, Under this here (a cup), young man, I put the pea, Now 'tis your turn the Dragon's purse to plunder If you know which of these the pea is under. You need but use your eyes—now, one, two, three, Under which thimble have I got the pea? Alm. (aside) Enter St. George R. Well, he's very verdant I declare, I twig'd the pea (aloud). Now paws off—it is there. [Points to one. Dra. Well, if I lose, I lose—now let us see. [Raises cup. It isn't there. Bystander. Of course not, here's the pea. [Raises another cup and shows it. St. Geo. Just as I thought, the Dragon's hooked Morocco. He'll very soon discover what's o'clock O. Alm. I've lost again; these peas are wondrous skippers— I'll try once more, so there's my Sunday slippers. [Places slippers. I must win once. Dra. (shuffling cups about) Should you those slippers lose? Alm. Oh! that will be another pair of shoes. St. Geo. Well, so you've lost? Alm. Oh lord! he's such a dab. Lend me a shilling, will you, for a cab? St. Geo. With pleasure (gives money) there. Dra. (comes down) Of course you'll go and brag on The clever way in which you've done the dragon. [Laughs loudly. Alm. My goodness gracious, there's a frightful laugh, I find old dragons won't be caught with chaff. [Retires up, as he is going, gamblers shake dice box, he hesitates, and then sneaks up to the table and appears to play. Dra. (to St. George.) Will you sir, take a turn? Bystander. Of course he will. St. Geo. I've not a bob about me but a bill. Dra. Oh! that'll do for me. St. Geo. I think your right, It only passed the House of Lords last night. Dra. (opens large bill given to him by St. George.) Dra. What's this, qui tam, oh la! that bill will floor us. St. Geo. What ho! police, come in and join the chorus. CHORUS. Air—“Bartlemy Fair.” Come toddle, brother prig, Here's an end to thimble rig, If we stop, I'm thinking really We shall visit the Old Bailey, For the act says very plain We shall never play again. Hark! the row has began—beware oh! There they are On the stair, Exit, you, Up the flue; You get out Down the spout, Done I am By qui tam. [Enter policeman to Dragon, ditto to Almidor; Dragon floors policeman, Almidor floors policeman. Hi down! go down! Both. I'm off for there's no time to spare oh! SCENE II. —A street in Memphis.—Enter St. George and Sabra, the latter disguised as an Arab. St. Geo. On such devotion I had never reckon'd, You from the first have tried my views to second. Sab. The task we have in hand, don't let us flag on; I'd walk a mile, to see you thrash that dragon, Nay, I believe, barefooted I could stump it, St. Geo. You are a trump, and therefore take this trumpet: [gives a tin trumpet. These evening papers, (gives some) blow the horn and cry them; Inviting every one to come and buy them. This is the way the sort of thing is done (crying) See-cond edition here! the Memphis Sun, Wondrous intelligence! for here you have in it The sudden resignation of the Cabinet. Sab. The Cabinet resigned! St. Geo. No, that's mere vapour! You must say something, just to sell the paper. Go stand before the Dragon's own abode, Sab. And for the trumpet— St. Geo. That love must be blow'd. [Sabra takes horn and cries. Sab. The Memphis Evening Sun; see-cond Edition! Ministers in a very bad condition. [runs off like news-boy. St. Geo. (with paper) I've had a paragraph inserted here, To say the Treasury is rather queer, I know the Dragon's disposition well, All his Exchequer Bills at once he'll sell; Having releived the state, we'll give the nation The benefit of a reduced taxation— The Income Tax can't be abandon'd yet, But cheaper glass and whalebone they shall get; When that is done, 'tis probable that you My blackamoor, will look a little blue. SONG. Air.—“Happy Tawny Moor.” Haughty Black-'a-moor, Tho' you love, Spite of snubbing, My own true love, Won't I spoil your plan, You blacky man;— For your tinkle, tinkle, She don't care a periwinkle. Tink a tink, &amp;c. SCENE III. —Interior of the Dragon's Loan Office.— Dragon discovered seated writing. Dra. This is the system which my coffer fills I lend my money on Exchequer bills; Enter Almidor, R. C. Alm. As down the street just now my carriage went I saw three balls and these words—“money lent.” Being hard up I'm not ashamed to own I've an occasion for a trifling loan. Dra. Allow me, sir, to offer a prospectus, [offers paper. I'm chairman of the body of directors. Alm. (taking it and reading.) Lets see—“First a deposit must be paid, “When that is done inquiries will be made, “As the society can't trust to chance “They must have all the interest in advance, “If the security turns out a bubble “The company keeps the money for the trouble.” I, only wish the company may get it. If that's the sort of loan, alone I'll let it. I want a little money. Dra. On your coat? Alm. What! no—upon my promissary note. Dra. To be accommodating I incline, My terms, sir, are half money and half wine, Sherry at 54—its fine, sir, very. Alm. The price at once proclaims it golden sherry. Dra. And then such crusted port—what ho! within, (calls off) Bring Day and Martin's port—you know the bin. Enter Dragonnitty with bottle. Alm. (holds up bottle) In quarts or pints? Dra, Those for quarts, sir, pass. Alm. Its time they took the duty off the glass. Dra. Multum in parvo, sir, I'm sure 'twill please; Look at the beeswing. Alm. Where do you keep your bees? [Dragonnitty takes bottle. To put the wing into the wine is funny; But here's my bill, and now then where's the money? Dra. The bill is eighty pounds, and there sir's twenty. Alm. What, only twenty! Dra. That for your bill's plenty. Alm. [Drinks and spatters. I'll never swallow stuff like that don't think it. Dra. You've bought it, but you're not compelled to drink it. Alm. That's true!—There's justice in his observations, 'Twill do to give away to poor relations. [Exit Almidor. SONG.—Dragon. Air—“Jolly Nose.” Folly knows that as long as he has any tip He may come to my house and make merry, And whilst in his pockets my finger I dip, I'm remarkably kind to him—very. Folly knows! He who sees the dice box through a glass, Thinks gaming's the height of perfection, And then to clean out an intemperate ass, I have never the slightest objection! Folly knows! &amp;c. [Horn without. Dra. That horn my calculation will distract, (calls off) Are you aware that that's against the act? [horn again. Policeman, you can interfere you know; Because you have been witness to a blow Sab. (passing door) Great news! great news! the Memphis Evening Sun, See-cond Edition! Dra. Ho there! give me one. [takes paper and comes down. What's this? a rumour we've no cause to doubt The ministers are shortly going out: Are they indeed! then precious ninnies they, Now that they're in, I think 'twere best to stay. [reading. Hollo! what's this I read—“important fact!”— The nation take the benefit of the act! Exchequer bills! oh! could I upon this count, Gone down to twenty—zounds! that's 80 discount: Oh! I shall faint, my heart with grief grows big, I'd tear my hair, but that I wear a wig. Enter St. George, C. Dra. (aside) Who's this? the very youth who if I right am, Destroyed my gambling gambols by a qui tam. St. Geo. Is this the office? yes, I'm pretty sure it is, [Seeing Dragon. Oh! I beg pardon; do you buy securities? Dra. Why that depends on what they are young man, I'm willing to do business if I can; For any thing I'll give a price that's fair, From an old coat up to a Railway share! St. Geo. I've coal shares, sir, in the Talacre concern, Such coals—you'll find, they're reg'lar bricks to burn. Dra. I've no objection, sir, to take your scrip, But just at present I'm devoid of tip; This very morning, sir, 'twas quite on speck, I drew a four pun' nineteen shilling check. St. Geo. I'll take your bill, Dra. I thank you all the same, But to a bill I never put my name. St. Geo. Excuse me, sir, as no offence I mean it, Your name's to many a bill, I've often seen it; Dra. I understand the sort of bill you saw, I meant I don't accept— St. Geo. No, but you draw; Dra. You're so polite, no more my prudence lingers, I'll buy your coals tho' I should burn my fingers. St. Geo. Oh! that with Talacre you could not do, Dra. (takes out pocket book) Will these Exchequer bills; sir, do for you? St. Geo. With pleasure, sir, I take them. Dra. (aside) Ha! he's done! I'll palm them off upon him every one. St. Geo. Behold the shares! (gives them)—(aside) he has them, what a victim! Dra. There are the bills, (aside) ha! ha! at last I've nick'd him. DUETT. St. George and the Dragon. St Geo. Done again! for he'll see that there they quote, That Talacre's not valued at a one pound note; His Exchequer bills I have in the pocket of my coat, And Talacre's not valued at a one pound note. Dra. Done him brown, for I see that here they quote, That Exchequer bills aint valued at a one pound note, His Talacre's I've got in the pocket of my coat, And Exchequer bills are valued at a one pound note. [Exit Dragon. SCENE IV. —The Street in Memphis. Enter St. George and Sabra. St. Geo. Sabra, where's my rival, have you seen him? Sab. What rival? not Almidor, you can't mean him! St. Geo. Yes, yes, Almidor— Sab. He will ne'er be mine, He's very ill—he drank the Dragon's wine. St. Geo. The Dragon's wine! it's quality I know, His port's a poison, very sure and slow; But let us hence, one triumph more I need, And that achieved, the Dragon's done indeed. DUET.—Sabra and St. George. Air.—Cellarius Waltz. And now its time I think to own, my dear, If you'll/That I'll become bone of my/thy bone, my dear. Your/My dad will not refuse, I hope, my dear. For if he does, we must elope my dear. 'Tis but to get A landaulet, And then for Gret- Na-Green, my dear. SCENE V. —Dragon's College of health. SOLO. AND CORO. (Dragon and Crowd discovered.) Dra. O these won'drous pills I swear, sirs, Can ev'n broken legs repair, sirs, And the price but thirteen pence, Plain directions you will find For the deaf, dumb, lame and blind. If you'd be cured at once of all your ills, You'd better try my wonderful life pills; No malady resists their monstrous power, Corns and consumptions cured in half-an-hour. I'm not a common general practitioner, But an M.D., which means first-rate physicianer. This vegetable pill will make you stare, [gives one to a figure. To carrots it has turned a head of hair. This patent life pill of old Parr doth savour, [gives one to figure. See what a beard it gives to that young shaver; A single box invests the barest lip With sleek moustachios, (takes money) thank you for the tip; You'll find directions how to take them right— A dozen in the morning, noon, and night. [Crowd exeunt. My patients of my treatment ne'er complain, Once dosed by me, they never come again. Enter Almidor (very ill) supported by St. George and Sabra. St. Geo. We're all anxiety to tax your skill, This gentleman is seriously ill; Dra. Allow me first to look into his face, It does appear a very serious case; You'd better, sir, explain your symptoms fully, Alm. I think I've got the grubs they call the mulli; Dra. Take twenty, number two Alm. I mean no pun, But I've too much regard for number one. I've something preying on my conscience, Dra. True; The bill I took of you will soon be due. Alm. You've hit the mark—oh, I'm an awful scamp, I gave it you, on an improper stamp, Dra. On a wrong stamp! then it's not worth a rap, Alm. You know its value to a T, old chap. Dra. You stagger me! Oh, if your words, sir, true are, Tell me what's to be done? St. G. I think that you are. Alm. But I some recompense have made you still, I'm dying, and you're mentioned in my will, I've left you, when my debts are paid, to be My sole residuary legatee, [Aside to St. George, That's when my debts are paid, but I'll be bound I'm not worth more than sixpence in the pound. Dra. What have you got to leave! This is a shock oh! Alm. I've left you all the kingdom of Morocco. Dra. Morocco! By the French 'twas taken, Alm. No! Dra. They talked of it— Alm. They didn't do it though! St. G. For introducing him you'll not object To stand a present. Dra. What do you expect? St. G. (aside to Dragon.) To half the kingdom I must lay a claim, Dra. Wont my acceptance come to just the same. St. G. Though to accommodation I incline, I fear that your acceptance ain't worth mine; But to be brief I'll tell you what to do, Just give me Privy Purse's I. O. U. Dra. Well, well, I wont be hard! I'll do what's fair. St. G. (holding out his hand.) The I. O. U. (Dragon gives it) Now I, and U, are square. Alm. (aside to St. George). Out of the Dragon's hands you've got my bill. St. G. (aside to Almidor.) I've all I want—now ask him for a pill. Alm. I'ts very strange how fancy will control us, I've taken quite a longing to a bolus, I've an idea that it may do me good. Dra. (aside) I'd never let you have one if it could. Of its effects I'm tolerably sure If it don't kill, I know it cannot cure, (giving one). Alm. (having taken the pills gradually gets better). What a delicious tonic! I can feel From top to toe I am upon the heal. The freedom of my breathing's getting greater, I do not seem to need a respirator. Dra. He seems recovering! am I awake? You can't be better, sir, there's some mistake. Alm. (Laughing) There's no mistake at all, I'm getting well. This is what is technically called “a sell!” Dra. But never mind, you're in my power still; You noted scamp, I've got your noted bill! Alm. My bill! then I've been done, and so have you, As the French say, a do de tout les deux. St. Geo. (laughing) You've both been victimised as you deserve. Alm. (to Dragon) I say, my friend, let's shew a little nerve— We'll, for the trick he's played us, both requite him I'll challenge him at once, and you shall fight him Dra. 'Tis you that all the quarrel is about, And yet you're leaving me to fight it out. Alm. But you are safe, vainly a sword assails One who's so very weighty in his scales. Dra. Well, I don't mind, he's treated me and you ill, And so I call him out to fight a duel! St. Geo. If his own weapons each of us may choose I'll fight. [Exit St. George. Dra. That's a request, I can't refuse. So I must fight—last night e'en as I slumbered I dreamt my days like the police were numbered; For what I know my minutes may be reckoned. Alm. Talking of minutes, I'll be your second. DUETT. “Mighty Jove.” Dra. O by Jove! in half an hour You shall see who is the best— O give my elbow double pow'r, And his jacket shall be drest. Alm. He's too bumptious, Mister Dragon, You must win so don't lose heart, Have not you six feet to brag on, Never fear I'll take your part. Both. Faith, I think I'm/my boy, you're made for milling. Bravo, bravo, strong and willing &amp;c., &amp;c. SCENE VI. —View of somebody's Sarcophagus—March.—Enter Ptolomy, Sabra, and Court followed by Dragon, Almidor, &amp;c. Pto. A duel say you then ourself will see Which of the two cock o'the walk shall be. Flourish. Enter St. George. Pto. How's this! unarmed—where is your spear and shield? St. Geo. To moral power, great king, my foe must yield, [Produces wand. Old Kabby's wand shall aid me in this mess, So presto, change. [Strikes tomb it changes to a steam press. Pto. Why what is that? St. Geo. The Press. 'Tis irresistible in its attack On everything that bears the name of quack. Pto. Now, take your ground? Alm. (to Dragon.) I say, old boy, beware! It seems a most remarkable affair. St. Geo. (placing the Dragon who trembles.) Humbugs and rogues at least, 'twill serve to show up, And he's a proper subject for a blow up. [Loud explosion—press sinks—Dragon falls as the Spirit of Truth appears. Ptolomy drops into the arms of attendants. Pto. Off with the Dragon's head, its proper place Is the Museum, under a glass case. St. Geo. If as a curiosity they take it To the Museum, somebody may break it. [They cut off the Dragon's head, place it on a spear and carry it off. St. Geo. To Truth, great King, the victory is due, Take back your privy purse, I O U. Thus the Exchequer Bills I do restore. Pto. The bills and I O U! pray say no more, I give to you at once my lovely daughter. (To audience) There'll be a splendid surplus on the quarter, Knights, whate'er you've done, 'tis very clear St. George alone has been triumphant here. [St. George stands with one foot on the Dragon, FINALE. St. George, Almidor, and Chorus, Though I've gained the approbation Of the great King Ptol-o-my By the neat decapi-tation Of the monstrous brute you see, But his Princess and his money To him won't be worth a pin If our wish to do the funny Should have failed your smiles to win. Dragon's head, through trap. With their conduct I'll not quarrel, 'Tis right that truth prevail, Thus, my head may “point a moral, Tho' it can't adorn a tail.” One request pray let me tag on— Tho' I own its rather trite— That St. George, sirs, and the Dragon May be found here every night.
