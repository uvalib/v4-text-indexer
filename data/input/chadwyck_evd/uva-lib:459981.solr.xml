      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF ZARA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To His Royal Highness the PRINCE. SIR, Writers, who mean no Int'rest, but their Arts; Of undepending Minds, and stedfast Hearts, Disclaiming Hopes, will empty Forms neglect; Nor need Permissionâto address Respect. Frank, as the manly Faith of antient Time, Let Truth, for once, approach the Great, in Rhime! Nor Publick Benefit, misguided, stray, Because a Private Wisher points its Way. If wond'ring, here, your Greatness condescends To ask, What's HE, who, thus, uncall'd, attends? Smile, at a Suitor, who, in Courts, untrac'd, Pleas'd, if o'erlook'd, thus, owns his humble Taste.â Vow'd an Unenvier, of the busy Great; Too plain for Flatt'ry; and, too calm for Hate: Hid to be Happy; who surveys, unknown, The pow'rless Cottage, and the peaceless Throne, A silent Subject to His own Controll: Of active Passions, but, unyielding Soul; Engross'd by NO Pursuits, amus'd, by All; But, deaf, as Adders, to Ambition's Call: Too Free, for Pow'r, (or Prejudice), to WIN, And, safely, lodging Liberty, WITHIN. Pardon, Great Prince! th'unfashionable Strain, That shuns to Dedicate; nor seeks to gain: That, (self-resigning) knows no narrow View; And, but for Publick Blessings, courts, ev'n YOU! Late, a bold Tracer of your measur'd Mind, (While, by the mournful Scene, to Grief inclin'd) I saw your Eloquence of Eyes confess Soft Sense of Belvidera's deep Distress, Prophetic, thence, fore-deem'd the rising Years; And hail'd a Happy Nation, in Your Tears! Oh!ânobly, touch'd!âth'inspiring Pleasure chuse, Snatch, from the sable Wave, the sinking Muse! Charming, be charm'd! the Stage's Anguish heal: And teach a languid People how to feel. Then her full Soul, shall Tragic Pow'r impart, And reach Three Kingdoms in their Prince's Heart! Lightness, disclaim'd, shall blush itself away: And reas'ning Sense resume forgotten Sway. Love, Courage, Loyalty, Taste, Honour, Truth, Flash'd from the Scene, re-charm our list'ning Youth: And, Virtues, (by Your Influence form'd) sustain The future Glories of their Founder's Reign. Nor, let due Care of a protected Stage, Misjudg'd Amusement, but spare Hours engage: Strong, serious, Truths, the manly Muse displays; And leads charm'd Reason thro' those flow'ry Ways. While History's cold Care but Facts enrolls, The Muse, (pervasive) saves the pictur'd Souls! Beyond all Egypt's Gums, embalms Mankind: And stamps the living Features of the Mind. Time can eject the Sons of Pow'r, from Fame; And, He, who gains a World, may Lose his Name. But, cherish'd Arts insure immortal Breath: And, bid their prop'd Defenders tread on Death! Look back, lov'd Prince! on Ages, sunk in Shade! And feel, what Darkness, absent Genius made! Think, on the dead Fore-fillers of your Place! Think, on the stern First-founders of your Race! And, where lost Story sleeps, in silent Night; Charge to their want of Taste, their want of Light. When, in your rising Grove, (no Converse nigh) Black Edward's awful Bust demands your Eye, Think, from what Cause, blind Chronicles DEFAME The gross-told Tow'rings, of that dreadful Name! Search him, thro' Fancy: and SUPPOSE him, shown By the Long Glories, to the Muses known: Shining, disclos'd;âo'ertrampling Death's Controll! And, opening, backward, All his Depth of Soul! Thenâbreathe a conscious Sigh, to mourn his Fate, Who form'd no Writers, like his Spirit, Great! To limn his living Thoughtsâpast Fame renew; And build Him Honours, they reserve, for You! I am, With profound Respect, SIR, Your Royal Highness's most humble and obedient Servant, A. HILL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Preface to the Reader. The Beauties, of Nature, will be Beauties, everlastingly.âIf they are, sometimes eclips'd, by a Cloud of ill Accidents, they disperse the dark Screen; and, again, become amiable. But, unwilling to suppose, we are, now, under Influence of such a Cloud, with Regard to Dramatical Taste, I thought it more decent, (and juster) to charge its Degeneracy to the Stage, than to the Genius of the Nation. Accounting in this manner for the Defect, I have often taken Pleasure, (when turning my Search towards a Remedy) to consider it, as no improbable Hope, that Young Actors, and Actresses, beginning, unseduc'd by AFFECTED Examples, might go some Length, toward what has been said, of a celebrated Writer, âWho reach'd Perfection, in his first Essay. It requir'd, methought, but the Assistance of a lively Imagination, join'd to an easy, and natural, Power; with a resolute Habitude, to BE, for an Hour or two, the very Persons, they wou'd seem.âSuch a Foundation for accomplish'd Acting, lies so open, and so clearly in Nature, that they, who find it at all, must discover it at first: because, when Men are once got out of the Road, they, who travel the farthest, have but most Length of Way to ride back again. Yet, the Interested in Playhouses were so positive, in the contrary Sentiment, that they submitted to reverence, as a Maxim, this extraordinary Concession, âThat Actors must be twenty Years such, before they can expect to be Masters, of the Air, and Tread, of the Stage. Now, there is but one View, in Nature, wherein I was willing to admit of this Argument: I was forc'd to confess, I had seen some particular Stage Airs, and Stage Treads, which a Man of good Sense might indeed, waste a long Life, in endeavouring to imitate, and, at last, lose his Labour! However, since an Opinion, in Opposition to these Gentlemen's, wanted Weight to make That believ'd possible, which had not, yet, been reduc'd into Practice, I took a sudden Resolution, actually to try, Who was in the Right, by attempting the Experiment.âThis, I knew, was a Design, which, succeeding, wou'd not fail to give Pleasure to the Publick; and, which, miscarrying, cou'd produce no worse Consequence, than my particular Mortification. I imagin'd it reasonable to found a Trial, of this Nature, rather on a New Play, than an Old one: And, as it ought to be a Play, of unquestionable Merit, it must have been Presumption, and Vanity, to have cast a Thought toward any thing, of my own.âUpon the whole, that I might keep out of the Reach either of Prejudice, or Partiality, a Foreign Production seem'd the properest Choice; and, the ZAIRE, of Monsieur de Voltaire, offer'd me every thing that Nature cou'd do, on the Part of the Poet: But, I had still something to wish, with regard to that other Part of her Influence, which depended on the Player. I had (of late) among the Rest of the Town, been depriv'd of all rational Pleasure from the Theatre, by a monstrous, and unmoving, Affection: which, choaking up the Avenues to Passion, had made Tragedy FORBIDDING, and Horrible! I was despairing to see a Correction of this Folly; when I found myself, unexpectedly, re-animated, by the War which The Prompter has proclaim'd, and is now, Weekly, waging, against the Ranters, and Whiners, of the Theatre; after having undertaken to reduce the Actor's lost Art, into Principles; with Design, by reconciling them to the touching, and spirited, Medium, to reform those wild Copies of Life, into some Resemblance, at least, of their Originals. Thus, confirm'd in my Sentiments, I ventur'd on the Cast of Two Capital Characters, into Hands, not disabled, by Custom, and obstinate Prejudice, from pursuing the Plain Track, of Nature. It was easy to induce Osman, (as he is a Relation of my own, and but too fond of the Amusement) to make Trial, how far his Delight, in an Art, I shall never allow him to practise, might enable him to supply one Part of the Proof, that, to imitate Nature, we must proceed, upon Natural Principles. At the same Time, it happen'd, that Mrs. Cibber was, fortunately, inclinable to exert her inimitable Talent, in additional Aid of my Purpose, with View to continue the Practice of a Profession, for which, Her Person, Her Voice, the unaffected Sensibility of her Heart, (and, her Face, so finely dispos'd, for assuming, and expressing, the Passions) have, so naturally, qualify'd her. And, to give this bold Novelty of Design, all its necessary Furtherance, Mr. Fletewood, who professes the most generous Inclinations, for Improvement of his troublesome Province, very willingly concurr'd, in whatever cou'd, on His Part, be of Use, to the Experiment. Behold, in this little Detail, from what Motive, I have taken upon me to throw one of the finest of French Plays upon the Publick.âIf my Expectations are not strangely deceiv'd, it will be found, by the Event, whether our Taste for true Tragedy is declin'd; or, the true Art of Acting it forgotten. From the First, I can have nothing to conclude, but, that my Judgment has been weak, and mistaken. But, if the Last proves the Case, I shall flatter myself, that those Persons of Quality, from whose imaginary Want of Discernment some People have not blush'd, to DERIVE their Dull Qualities, will, in Right of their insulted Understanding, EXACT, for the future, a warm, and, toilsome, Exertion, of the Strong and the Natural, tho' at the Cost of the Lazy, and Affected. This would awaken, at once, the Reflexion, of many, who have it in their Power to be moving, and natural, Actors; and, by effectually convincing them, that their Present Opinion is wrong, bring 'em over (for their own, and the Publick Advantage) to embrace, and succeed by, a New one. Such a Step, toward reforming the Theatre, wou'd draw on, (as a Consequence) many, of its nobler Improvements.â For, where Emotions are keenest, the Delight becomes greatest; and, to whatever most charms, we, most closely, adhere; and, encourage it, most actively. If, in translating this excellent Tragedy, I have regarded, in some Places, the Soul, and, in others, the Letter, of the Original, Monsieur de Voltaire, who has made himself a very capable Judge, both of our Language, and Customs, will indulge me that Latitude; except, he shou'd, in observing some Alterations I have made, in his Names, and his Diction, forget, that their Motives are to be found, in the Turn of our National Difference. After what I have said of the Playhouses, it wou'd be Injustice, not to declare, that I exclude from the Censure, of Speaking, or acting, unnaturally, Any One of the Persons, who have been cast into ZARA.âAnd, in particular, I must say This, of TWO of them; that Mr. Milward, who is already a very excellent, and hourly rising to be an accomplish'd, Actor, has a Voice, that both comprehends, and expresses, the utmost Compass of Harmony.âAnd, Mr. Cibber, discerningly, pursued, thro' the numberless Extent of his Walks, is an Actor, of as unlimited a Compass of Genius, as ever I saw on the Stage: and, is, barely, receiv'd, as he deserves, when the Town is most favourable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by COLLEY CIBBER, Esq; Spoke by Mr. CIBBER. The French, howe'er Mercurial they may seem, Extinguish half their Fire, by Critic Phlegm: While English Writers Nature's Freedom claim, And warm their Scenes with an ungovern'd Flame: 'Tis strange, that Nature never should inspire A Racine's Judgment, with a Shakespear's Fire! Howe'er, to-nightâ(to promise much we're loth) Butâyou've a Chance, to have a Taste of Both. From English Plays, Zara's French Author fir'd, Confess'd his Muse, beyond herself, inspir'd; From rack'd Othello's Rage, he rais'd his Style, And snatch'd the Brand, that lights his Tragick Pile: Zara's Success his utmost Hopes outflew, And a twice twentieth Weeping Audience drew. As for our English Friend, he leaves to you, Whate'er may seem to his Performance due; No Views of Gain, his Hopes or Fears engage, He gives a Child of Leisure to the Stage: Willing to try, if yet, forsaken Nature, Can charm, with any One remember'd Feature. Thus far, the Author speaksâbut now, the Player, With trembling Heart, prefers His humble Prayer. To-night, the greatest Venture of my Life, Is Lost, or Sav'd, as You receiveâa Wife: If Time, you think, may ripen her, to Merit, With gentle Smiles, support her wavering Spirit. Zara, in France, at once, an Actress rais'd, Warm'd into Skill, by being kindly Prais'd: O! could such Wonders Here, from Favour flow, How would our Zara's Heart, with Transport Glow! But she, alas! by juster Fears opprest, Begs but your bare Endurance, at the Best. Her unskill'd Tongue would simple Nature speak, Nor dares Her Bounds, for false Applauses break. Amidst a thousand Faults, her best Presence To pleaseâis unpresuming Innocence. When a chaste Heart's Distress your Grief demands, One silent Tear outweighs a thousand Hands. If she conveys the pleasing Passions, RIGHT, Guard and Suppor her, this decisive Night. If she mistakesâor, finds her Strength too small, Let interposing Pityâbreak her Fall. In You it rests, to Save her, or Destroy, If She draws Tears from You, I Weepâfor Joy.</field>

Your Peace of Mind increases with your Charms; Tears, now, no longer shade your Eyes' soft Lustre: You meditate, no more, those happy Climes, To which Nerestan will return to guide you: You talk no more of that gay Nation, now, Where Men adore their Wives, and Woman's Power Draws Rev'rence from a polish'd People's Softness: Their Husbands' Equals; and their Lovers' Queens Free, without Scandal; wise, without Restraint; Their Vertue, due to Nature, not to Fear!

Joys, which we do not know, we do not wish; My Fate's bound in, by Sion's sacred Wall; Clos'd, from my Infancy, within this Palace, Custom has learnt, from Time, the Power to please: I claim no Share in the remoter World, The Sultan's Property, his Will my Law; Unknowing All, but Him, his Power, his Fame; To live his Subject, is my only Hope, All, else, an empty Dream.â SELIMA. Have you forgot Absent Nerestan then? whose gen'rous Friendship, So nobly vow'd Redemption from your Chains! How oft have you admir'd his dauntless Soul! Osman, his Conqu'ror, by his Courage, charm'd, Trusted his Faith, and, on his Word, releas'd him: Tho' not return'd, in Timeâwe, yet, expect Him. Nor had his Noble Journey other Motive, Than to procure our Ransom;âAnd is this, This dear, warm, Hopeâbecome an idle Dream? ZARA. Since, after two long Years, he not returns, 'Tis plain, his Promise stretch'd beyond his Power: A Stranger, and a Slave, unknown, like him, Proposing much, means Little;âTalks, and vows, Delighted with a Prospect of Escape:â He promis'd to redeem Ten Christians more, And free us All, from Slavery!âI own, I once admir'd th'unprofitable Zeal, But, now, it charms no longer.â SELIMA. What! if yet, He, faithful, shou'd return, and hold his Vow! Wou'd you not, thenâ ZARA. No matterâTime is past; And every Thing is chang'dâ SELIMA. But, whence comes This? ZARA. Goâ'twere too much, to tell thee Zara's Fate; The Sultan's Secrets, all, are sacred, here: But my fond Heart delights to mix with Thine.â Some Three Months past, when thou, and other Slaves, Were forc'd to quit fair Jordan's flow'ry Bank; Heaven, to cut short the Anguish of my Days, Rais'd me, to Comfort, by a powerful Hand! This mighty Osman! SELIMA. What of Him? ZARA. This Sultan! This Conqu'ror of the Christians! lovesâ SELIMA. Whom? ZARA. Zara!â Thou blushest, and I guess, thy Thoughts accuse me; But, know me betterâ'twas unjust Suspicion: All Emperor, as he is, I cannot stoop To Honours, that bring Shame and Baseness with 'em. Reason, and Pride, those Props of Modesty, Sustain my guarded Heart, and strengthen Vertue; Rather than sink to Infamy, let Chains Embrace me, with a Joy, such Love denies: NoâI shall, now, astonish thee;âHis Greatness Submits, to own a pure, and honest Flame; Among the shining Crowds, which live, to please him, His whole Regard is fix'd on Me, alone: He offers Marriageâand its Rites, now, wait, To crown me Empress of this Eastern World. SELIMA. Your Vertue, and your Charms, deserve it All: My Heart is not surpriz'd, but struck, to hear it; If, to be Empress, can compleat your Happiness, I rank myself, with Joy, among your Slaves. ZARA. Be, still, my Equalâand enjoy my Blessings: For, Thou partaking, they will bless Me more. SELIMA. Alas! but Heaven! will it permit this Marriage? Will not this Grandeur, falsely, call'd a Bliss, Plant Bitterness, and root it, in your Heart? Have you forgot, you are of Christian Blood? ZARA. Ah me! what hast thou said? Why wou'dst thou, thus, Recall my wav'ring Thoughts?âHow know I, what, Or whence I am? Heaven kept it, hid, in Darkness, Conceal'd me from myself, and from my Blood. SELIMA. Nerestan, who was born a Christian, here, Asserts, that You, like Him, had Christian Parents; BesidesâThat Cross, which, from your Infant Years, Has been preserv'd, was found upon your Bosom, As if design'd, by Heaven, a Pledge of Faith, Due to the God you purpose to forsake! ZARA. Can my fond Heart, on such a feeble Proof, Embrace a Faith, abhorr'd by him I love? I see, too plainly, Custom forms us All; Our Thoughts, our Morals, our most fix'd Belief, Are Consequences of our Place of Birth: Born beyond Ganges, I had been a Pagan; In France, a Christian;âI am, here, a Saracen: 'Tis but Instruction, all! Our Parents' Hand Writes, on our Heart, the first, faint Characters, Which Time, re-tracing, deepens into Strength, That nothing can efface, but Death, or Heaven!â Thou wert not made a Pris'ner in this Place, Till, after Reason, borrowing Force from Years, Had lent its Lustre, to enlighten Faith:â For me, who, in my Cradle was their Slave, Thy Christian Doctrines were, too lately, taught me; Yet, far from having lost the Rev'rence due, This Cross, as often as it meets my Eye, Strikes thro' my Heart a kind of awful Fear! I honour, from my Soul, the Christian Laws, Those Laws, which, soft'ning Nature, by Humanity, Melt Nations into Brotherhood;âno doubt, Christians are happy; and, 'tis just to love 'em. SELIMA. Why have you, then, declar'd yourself their Foe? Why will you join your Hand, with this proud Osman's? Who owes his Triumphs to the Christians' Ruin! ZARA. Ah!âWho cou'd slight the Offer of his Heart? Nayâfor I mean to tell thee all my Weakness; Perhaps, I had, ere now, profess'd Thy Faith, But Osman lov'd meâand I've lost it All:â I think, on none, but Osmanâmy pleas'd Heart, Fill'd with the Blessing, to be lov'd, by Him, Wants Room for other Happiness:âPlace thou, Before thy Eyes, his Merit, and his Fame, His Youth, yet, blooming but in Manhood's Dawn! How many conquer'd Kings have swell'd his Pow'r! Think, too, how lovely! how his Brow becomes This Wreath of early Glories!âOh! my Friend! I talk not of the Scepter, which he gives me:â Noâto be charm'd with That, were Thanks, too humble! Offensive Tribute, and, too poor, for Love! 'Twas Osman, won my Heart, not Osman's Crown: I love not, in Him, aught, besides Himself. Thou think'st, perhaps, that these are Starts of Passion; But, had the Will of Heav'n, less bent to bless him, Doom'd Osman to my Chains, and Me, to fill The Throne, that Osman sits onâRuin and Wretchedness, Catch, and consume, my Wishes, but I wou'dâ To raise me, to my self, descend, to Him. SELIMA. I hear, methinks, his Stepâ'Tis heâhe comesâ [Exit Selima. Zara. My Heart prevented him, and found him near; Absent, two whole long Days, the slow-pac'd Hour, At last, is comeâand gives him, to my Wishes! Enter Osman, reading a Paper, which he re-delivers to Orasmin. OSMAN. Wait my Returnâor, shou'd there be a Cause, That may require my Presenceâdo not fear To enterâever mindful, that my Own [Exit Orasmin. Follows my People's, Happiness.âAt length, Cares have releas'd my Heartâto Love, and Zara. ZARA. 'Twas not in cruel Absence, to deprive me Of your Imperial Imageâevery where, You reign, triumphant: Memory supplies Reflexion, with your Pow'r; and you, like Heaven, Are, always presentâand are, always gracious. OSMAN. The Sultans, my great Ancestors, bequeath'd Their Empire to me, but their Taste they gave not; Their Laws, their Lives, their Loves, delight not me: I know, our Prophet smiles, on am'rous Wishes; And opens a wide Field, to vast Desire: I know, that, at my Will, I might possess; That, wasting Tenderness, in wild Profusion, I might look down, to my surrounded Feet, And bless contending Beauties.âI might speak, Serenely slothful, from within my Palace, And bid my Pleasure be my People's Law. But, sweet, as Softness is, its End is cruel; I can look round, and count a Hundred Kings, Unconquer'd, by themselves, and Slaves to others: Hence was Jerusalem, to Christians, lost; But Heaven, to blast that unbelieving Race, Taught me, to be a King, by thinking like one. Hence, from the distant Euxine, to the Nile, The Trumpet's Voice has wak'd the World to War; Yet, amidst Arms, and Death, thy Power has reach'd me: For, thou disdain'st, like me, a languid Love; Glory, and Zara, joinâand charm, together. ZARA. I hear, at once, with Blushes, and, with Joy, This Passion, so unlike your Country's Customs. OSMAN. Passion, like mine, disdains my Country's Customs, The Jealousy, the Faintness, the Distrust, The proud, superior, Coldness, of the East: I know to love you, Zara, with Esteem; To trust your Vertue, and to court your Soul. Nobly confiding, I unveil my Heart, And dare inform you, that, 'tis All your own: My Joys must, All, be yoursâonly my Cares Shall lie, conceal'd, withinâand reach not Zara. ZARA. Oblig'd, by this Excess of Tenderness, How low, how wretched, was the Lot of Zara! Too poor, with aught, but Thanks, to pay such Blessings! OSMAN. Not soâI loveâand wou'd be lov'd, again; Let me confess it, I possess a Soul, That wishes, all, it wishes, ardently. I shou'd believe, you hated, had you Power To love, with Moderation: 'Tis my Aim, In every Thing, to reach supreme Perfection. If, with an equal Flame, I touch your Heart, Marriage attends your Smileâbut know, 'twill make Me wretched, if it makes not Zara happy. ZARA. Ah! Sir, if such a Heart, as gen'rous Osman's, Can, from my Will, submit to take its Bliss, What Mortal, ever, was decreed so happy! Pardon the Pride, with which I own my Joy; Thus, wholly, to possess the Man, I love! To know, and to confess, his Will my Fate! To be the happy Work of his dear Hands! To beâ Enter Orasmin. OSMAN. Already interrupted! What? Who?âWhence? ORASMIN. This Moment, Sir, there is arriv'd That Christian Slave, who, licens'd, on his Faith, Went hence, to Franceâand, now return'd, prays Audience. ZARA. [Aside.] O! Heaven! OSMAN. Admit himâWhat?âWhy comes he not?â ORASMIN. He waits, without;âNo Christian dares approach This Place, long sacred to the Sultan's Privacies. OSMAN. Goâbring him with theeâMonarchs, like the Sun, Shine but in vain, unwarming, if unseen: With Forms, and Rev'rence, let the Great approach us, Not the Unhappy;âEvery Place, alike, Gives the Distress'd a Privilege to enter.â [Exit Orasmin. I think, with Horror, on these dreadful Maxims, Which harden Kings, insensibly, to Tyrants. Re-enter Orasmin, with Nerestan. NERESTAN. Imperial Sultan! honour'd, ev'n by Foes! See me, return'd, regardful of my Vow, And, punctual, to discharge a Christian's Duty: I bring the Ransom of the Captive, Zara, Fair Selina, the Partner of her Fortune, And of Ten Christian Captives, Pris'ners, here. You promis'd, Sultan, if I shou'd return, To grant their rated Liberty:âBehold, I am return'd, and they are yours, no more. I wou'd have stretch'd my Purpose, to Myself, But Fortune has deny'd it;âMy poor All Suffic'd, no further; and a noble Poverty Is, now, my whole Possession:âI redeem The promis'd Christians; for I taught 'em Hope. But, for myself, I come, again, your Slave, To wait the fuller Hand of future Charity. OSMAN. Christian! I must confess, thy Courage charms me; But let thy Pride be taught, it treads too high, When it presumes to climb, above my Mercy.â Go, ransomless, thy selfâand carry back Their unaccepted Ransoms, join'd with Gifts, Fit to reward thy Purpose:âInstead of Ten, Demand a Hundred Christians; they are thine: Take 'emâand bid 'em teach their haughty Country, They left some Virtue, among Saracens.â Be Lusignan, alone, exceptedâHe, Who boasts the Blood of Kings, and dares lay Claim To My JerusalemâThat Claim his Guilt! Such is the Law of States, had I been vanquish'd, Thus had He said, of Me:âI mourn his Lot, Who must, in Fetters, lost to Day-light, pine, And sigh away old Age, in Grief, and Pain.â For Zaraâbut to name her, as a Captive, Were to dishonour Language;âshe's a Prize, Above thy Purchase;âAll the Christian Realms, With all their Kings to guide 'em, wou'd unite In vain, to force her from me.âGo, retireâ NERESTAN. For Zara's Ransom, with her own Consent, I had your Royal WordâFor Lusignanâ Unhappy, poor, old Manâ OSMAN. Was I not heard? Have I not told thee, Christian, all my Will? What, if I prais'd thee!âThis presumptuous Virtue, Compelling my Esteem, provokes my Pride: Be goneâand, when to-morrow's Sun shall rise On my Dominions, be not foundâtoo near me. [Exit Nerestan. ZARA. [Aside.] Assist him, Heaven! OSMAN. Zara, retire, a Momentâ Assume, throughout my Palace, Sovereign Empire, While I give Orders, to prepare the Pomp, That waits, to crown the Mistress of my Throne: [Leads her out, and returns. Orasmin! didst thou mark th'imperious Slave? What cou'd he mean?âhe sigh'dâand, as he went, Turn'd, and look'd back at Zara!âdid'st thou mark it? ORASMIN. Alas! my Sovereign Master! let not Jealousy Strike high enough, to reach your noble Heart. OSMAN. Jealousy, said'st thou? I disdain it:âNo!â Distrust is poor; and a misplac'd Suspicion Invites, and justifies, the Falshood fear'd.â Yet, as I love with WarmthâSo, I cou'd hate! But, Zara, is above Disguise, and Art:â My Love is stronger, nobler, than my Power. Jealous!âI was not jealousâIf I was, I am notânoâmy Heartâbut, let us drown Remembrance of the Word, and of the Image: My Heart is fill'd with a diviner Flame.â Goâand prepare for the approaching Nuptials; Zara to careful Empire joins Delight. I must allot one Hour to Thoughts of State, Then, all the smiling Day is Love, and Zara's. [Exit Orasmin. Monarchs, by Forms of pompous Misery, press'd, In proud, unsocial, Solitude, unbless'd, Wou'd, but for Love's soft Influence, curse their Throne, And, among crowded Millions, live, alone.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. NERESTAN, CHATILLON. CHATILLON. Matchless Nerestan! Generous, and Great! You, who have broke the Chains of hopeless Slaves! You, Christian Saviour! by a Saviour sent! Appear, be known, enjoy your due Delight; The grateful Weepers wait, to clasp your Knees, They throng, to kiss the happy Hand, that sav'd 'em: Indulge the kind Impatience of their Eyes, And, at their Head, command their Hearts, for ever. NERESTAN. Illustrious Chatillon! this Praise o'erwhelms me; What have I done, beyond a Christian's Duty? Beyond, what You wou'd, in my Place, have done? CHATILLON. TrueâIt is ev'ry honest Christian's Duty; Nay, 'tis the Blessing of such Minds, as ours, For others' Good, to sacrifice our own.â Yet, happy they, to whom Heaven grants the Power, To execute, like you, that Duty's Call! For usâthe Relicks of abandon'd War, Forgot in France, and, in Jerusalem, Left, to grow old, in Fetters;âOsman's Father Consign'd us to the Gloom of a damp Dungeon, Where, but for you, we must have groan'd out Life; And native France have bless'd our Eyes no more. NERESTAN. The Will of Gracious Heaven, that soften'd Osman, Inspir'd me, for your sakes;âBut, with our Joy, Flows, mix'd, a bitter SadnessâI had hop'd, To save, from their Perversion, a young Beauty, Who, in her Infant Innocence, with me, Was made a Slave by cruel Noradin; When, sprinkling Syria, with the Blood of Christians, CÃ¦sarea's Walls saw Lusignan, surpris'd, And the proud Crescent rise, in bloody Triumph: From this Seraglio, having, young, escap'd, Fate, Three Years since, restor'd me to my Chains; Then, sent to Paris, on my plighted Faith, I flatter'd my fond Hope, with vain Resolves, To guide the lovely Zara, to that Court, Where Lewis has establish'd Virtue's Throne;â But Osman will detain herâyet, not Osman; Zara, herself, forgets she is a Christian, And loves the Tyrant Sultan!âLet That pass: I mourn a Disappointment, still, more cruel; The Prop of all our Christian Hope is lost! CHATILLON. Dispose me, at your WillâI am your own. NERESTAN. Oh, Sir! Great Lusignan, so long, their Captive, That Last, of an Heroick Race of Kings! That Warrior! whose past Fame has fill'd the World! Osman refuses, to my Sighs, for ever! CHATILLON. Nay, then, we have been all redeem'd, in vain; Perish that Soldier, who wou'd quit his Chains, And leave his noble Chief, behind, in Fetters. Alas! you know him not, as I have known him; Thank Heaven, that plac'd your Birth, so far, remov'd, From those detested Days of Blood, and Woe; But I, less happy, was condemn'd, to see Thy Walls, Jerusalem, beat downâand all Our pious Fathers' Labours lost, in Ruins! Heaven! had you seen the very Temple rifled! The Sacred Sepulchre, itself, profan'd! Fathers with Children, mingled, flame together! And our last King, oppress'd, by Age, and Arms, Murder'dâand bleeding, o'er his murder'd Sons! Then, Lusignan, sole Remnant of his Race, Rallying our fated Few, amidst the Flames, Fearless, beneath the Crush of falling Towers, The Conqu'rors, and the Conquer'd, Groans, and Death! Dreadfulâand, waving in his Hand, a Sword, Red, with the Blood of Infidelsâcry'd out, This Way, ye faithful Christians! follow Meâ NERESTAN How full of Glory was that brave Retreat! CHATILLON. 'Twas Heaven, no doubt, that sav'd, and led him on; Pointed his Path; and march'd, our Guardian Guide: We reach'd CÃ¦sareaâthere, the general Voice Chose Lusignan, thenceforth, to give us Laws; Alas! 'twas vainâCÃ¦sarea cou'd not stand, When Sion's Self was fall'n!âwe were betray'd; And Lusignan condemn'd, to Length of Life, In Chains, and Damps, and Darkness, and Despair: Yet, Great, amidst his Miseries, he look'd, As if he cou'd not feel his Fate, himself, But, as it reach'd his Followers:âAnd shall we, For whom our gen'rous Leader suffer'd This, Be, vilely, safe? and dare be bless'd, without him? NERESTAN. Oh! I shou'd hate the Liberty, he shar'd not: I knew, too well, these Miseries, you describe, For I was born, amidst 'emâChains, and Death, CÃ¦sarea lost, and Saracens, triumphant, Were the first Objects, which my Eyes e'er look'd on. Hurried, an Infant, among other Infants, Snatch'd, from the Bosoms of their bleeding Mothers, A Temple sav'd us, till the Slaughter ceas'd; Then, were we sent to this ill-fated City, Here, in the Palace of our former Kings, To learn, from Saracens, their hated Faith, And be compleatly wretched.âZara, too, Shar'd this Captivity; we, both, grew up, So near each other, that a tender Friendship Endear'd her to my Wishes:âMy fond Heartâ Pardon its Weakness! bleeds, to see her lost, And, for a barb'rous Tyrant, quit her God! CHATILLON. Such is the Saracens', too fatal, Policy! Watchful Seducers, still, of Infant Weakness. Happy, that You, so young, escap'd their Hands! But, let us thinkâMay not this Zara's Int'rest, Loving the Sultan, and, by him belov'd, For Lusignan procure some softer Sentence? The Wise, and Just, with Innocence, may draw Their own Advantage, from the Guilt of others. NERESTAN. How shall I gain Admission to her Presence? Osman has banish'd meâbut That's a Trifle; Will the Seraglio's Portals open to me? Or, cou'd I find That, easy, to my Hopes, What Prospect of Success, from an Apostate? On whom I cannot look, without Disdain; And who will read her Shame, upon my Brow? The hardest Trial of a gen'rous Mind Is, to court Favours, from a Hand it scorns. CHATILLON. Think, it is Lusignan, we seek to serve. NERESTAN. WellâIt shall be attemptedâHark! who's this? Are my Eyes false? or, is it, really, She? Enter Zara. ZARA. Start not, my worthy Friend! I come, to seek you; The Sultan has permitted it; fear nothing:â But, to confirm my Heart, which trembles, near you; Soften that angry Air, nor look Reproach; Why should we fear each other, Both, mistaking? Associates, from our Birth, one Prison held us, One Friendship taught Affliction, to be calm; Till Heaven thought fit to favour your Escape, And call you to the Fields of happier France; Thence, once again, it was my Lot to find you, A Pris'ner, here; where, hid, amongst a Crowd Of undistinguish'd Slaves, with less Restraint, I shar'd your frequent Converse;â It pleas'd your Pity, shall I say your Friendship? Or, rather, shall I call it generous Charity? To form that noble Purpose, to redeem Distressful Zaraâyou procur'd my Ransom, And, with a Greatness, that out-soar'd a Crown, Return'd, Yourself a Slave, to give Me Freedom! But Heaven has cast our Fate, for different Climes; Here, in Jerusalem, I fix, for ever: Yet, among all the Shine, that marks my Fortune, I shall, with frequent Tears, remember yours; Your Goodness will, for ever, sooth my Heart, And keep your Image, still, a Dweller, there. Warm'd, by your great Example, to protect That Faith, that lifts Humanity, so high, I'll be a Mother to distressful Christians. NERESTAN. How!âYou protect the Christians! You, who can Abjure their saving Truth!âand, coldly, see Great Lusignan, their Chief, die slow, in Chains? ZARA. To bring him Freedom, you behold me here, You will, this Moment, meet his Eyes, in Joy: CHATILLON. Shall I, then, live, to bless that happy Hour? NERESTAN. Can Christians owe, so dear a Gift, to Zara? ZARA. Hopeless, I gather'd Courage, to entreat The Sultan, for his LibertyâAmaz'd, So soon, to gain the Happiness, I wish'd! See! where they bring the good, old Chief, grown dim, With Age, by Pain, and Sorrows, hasten'd on! CHATILLON. How is my Heart dissolv'd, with sudden Joy! ZARA. I long to view his venerable Face, But Tears, I know not why, eclipse my Sight! I feel, methinks, redoubled Pity for him; But I, alas! myself, have been a Slave; And, when we pity Woes, which we have felt, 'Tis but a partial Virtue! NERESTAN. Amazement!âWhence this Greatness, in an Infidel! Enter Lusignan, led in by two Guards. LUSIGNAN. Where am I? What forgiving Angel's Voice Has call'd me, to revisit long-lost Day? Am I with Christians?âI am weakâforgive me, And guide my trembling Steps;âI'm full of Years, Yet, Misery has worn me, more than Age. [Seating himself.] Am I, in Truth, at Liberty? CHATILLON. You are; And every Christian's Grief takes end, with yours. LUSIGNAN. O, Light!âO! dearer, far, than Light! that Voice! Chatillon! is it you?âmy Fellow Martyr! And, shall our Wretchedness, indeed, have end? In what Place are we, now?âmy feeble Eyes, Difus'd to Daylight, long, in vain, to find you. CHATILLON. This was the Palace of your Royal Fathers, 'Tis, now, the Son of Noradin's Seraglio. ZARA. The Master of this Placeâthe mighty Osman! Distinguishes, and loves to cherish, Virtue; This gen'rous Frenchman, yet, a Stranger to you, Drawn from his Native Soil, from Peace, and Rest, Brought the vow'd Ransoms of Ten Christian Slaves, Himself, contented, to remain a Captive: But Osman, charm'd by Greatness, like his own, To equal, what he lov'd, has giv'n him, You. LUSIGNAN. So, gen'rous France inspires her social Sons! They have been, ever, dear, and useful to me! Wou'd I were nearer to himâNoble Sir! [Nerestan approaches. How have I merited, that you, for me, Shou'd pass such distant Seas, to bring me Blessings, And hazard your own Safety, for my Sake? NERESTAN. My Name, Sir, is NerestanâBorn, in Syria, I wore the Chains of Slav'ry, from my Birth; Till, quitting the proud Crescent, for the Court, Where warlike Lewis reigns, beneath his Eye, I learnt the Trade of Arms:âThe Rank, I hold, Was but the kind Distinction, which he gave me, To tempt my Courage, to deserve Regard. Your Sight, unhappy Prince, wou'd charm his Eye; That Best, and Greatest Monarch, will behold, With Grief, and Joy, those venerable Wounds, And print Embraces, where your Fetters bound you: All Paris will revere the Cross's Martyr; Paris, the Refuge, still, of ruin'd Kings! LUSIGNAN. Alas! in Times, long past, I've seen its Glory: When Philip, the Victorious, liv'dâI fought, Abreast, with Montmorency, and Melun, D'Estaing, De Neile, and the far-famous Courcy;â Names, which were, then, the Praise, and Dread, of War! But, what have I to do, at Paris, now? I stand upon the Brink of the cold Grave; That way, my Journey liesâto find, I hope, The King of Kings, and move Remembrance, there, Of all my Woes, long-suffer'd, for his sake.â You, gen'rous Witnesses of my last Hour, While I yet live, assist my humble Prayers, And join the Resignation of my Soul. Nerestan! Chatillon! and youâfair Mourner! Whose Tears do Honour to an old Man's Sorrows! Pity a Father, the unhappiest, sure! That ever felt the Hand of angry Heaven! My Eyes, tho' dying, still, can furnish Tears: Half my long Life they flow'd, and, still, will flow! A Daughter, and three Sons, my Heart's proud Hopes, Were, all, torn from me, in their tend'rest Years; My Friend Chatillon knows, and can rememberâ CHATILLON. Wou'd I were able, to forget your Woe. LUSIGNAN. Thou wert a Pris'ner, with me, in CÃ¦sarea, And, there, beheld'st my Wife, and Two dear Sons Perish, in FlamesâThey did not need the Grave, Their Foes wou'd have deny'd 'em!âI beheld it; Husband! and Father! helpless, I beheld it! Deny'd the mournful Privilege, to die! If ye are Saints in Heaven, as, sure! ye are! Look, with an Eye of Pity, on That Brother, That Sister, whom you left!âif I have, yet, Or Son, or Daughter:âfor, in early Chains, Far from their lost, and, unassisting Father, I heard, that they were sent, with Numbers more, To this Seraglio; hence, to be dispers'd, In nameless Remnants, o'er the East, and spread Our Christian Miseries, round a faithless World. CHATILLON. 'Twas trueâfor, in the Horrors of that Day, I snatch'd your Infant Daughter, from her Cradle; But, finding ev'ry Hope of Flight was vain, Scarce had I sprinkled, from a publick Fountain, Those sacred Drops, which wash the Soul from Sin; When, from my bleeding Arms, fierce Saracens Forc'd the lost Innocent, who, smiling, lay, And pointed, playful, at the swarthy Spoilers! With Her, your youngest, then, your only Son, Whose little Life had reach'd the fourth, sad Year, And, just, giv'n Sense, to feel his own Misfortunes, Was order'd to this City. NERESTAN. I, too, hither, Just, at that fatal Age, from lost CÃ¦sarea, Came, in that Crowd of undistinguish'd Christians.â LUSIGNAN. You?âcame You thence?âAlas! who knows but you Might, heretofore, have seen my Two, poor Children? [Looking up] Ha! Madam! that small Ornament you wear, Its Form a Stranger to this Country's Fashion, How long has it been yours? ZARA. From my first Breath, Sirâ Ah! What!âyou seem surpriz'd!âWhy should This move you? LUSIGNAN. Wou'd you confide it to my trembling Hands? ZARA. To what new Wonder, am I now reserv'd? Oh! Sir, what mean you? LUSIGNAN. Providence! and Heaven! O, failing Eyes! deceive ye not my Hope? Can this be possible?âYes, yesâ'tis She! This little CrossâI know it, by sure Marks; Oh! take me, Heav'n! while I can die with Joyâ ZARA. O! do not, Sir, distract me!ârising Thoughts, And Hopes, and Fears, o'erwhelm me! LUSIGNAN. Tell me, yet, Has it remain'd, for ever, in your Hands? What!âBoth, brought Captives, from CÃ¦sarea, hither? ZARA. Both, bothâ NERESTAN. Oh, Heaven! have I, then, found a Father? LUSIGNAN. Their Voice! their Looks! The living Images of their dear Mother! O, Thou! who, thus, canst bless my Life's last Sand! Strengthen my Heart, too feeble for this Joy. Madam! Nerestan!âHelp me, Chatillon! [Rising. Nerestan! if thou ought'st to own that Name, Shines there, upon thy Breast, a noble Scar, Which, ere CÃ¦sarea fell, from a fierce Hand, Surprising us, by Night, my Child receiv'd? NERESTAN. Bless'd Hand!âI bear it, Sirâthe Mark is there! LUSIGNAN. Merciful Heaven! NERESTAN. [Kneeling.] O, Sir!âO, Zara, kneel.â ZARA. [Kneeling.] My Father?âOh!â LUSIGNAN. O, my lost Children! BOTH. Oh!â LUSIGNAN. My Son! my Daughter! Lost, in embracing you, I wou'd, now, die, lest this shou'd prove a Dream. CHATILLON. How touch'd is my glad Heart, to see their Joy! LUSIGNAN. Again, I find youâdear, in Wretchedness: O, my brave Son!âand, Thou, my nameless Daughter! Now, dissipate all Doubt, remove all Dread: Has Heaven, that gives me back my Childrenâgiv'n 'em, Such, as I lost 'em?âCome they, Christians, to me?â One weepsâand one declines a conscious Eye! Your Silence speaksâToo well I understand it. ZARA. I cannot, Sir, deceive youâOsman's Laws Were mineâand Osman is not Christian.â LUSIGNAN. Oh! my misguided Child!âat that sad Word, The little Life, yet mine, had left me, quite, But that my Death might fix thee, lost, for ever. Sixty long Years, I fought the Christian's Cause, Saw their doom'd Temple fall, their Power destroy'd: Twenty, a Captive, in a Dungeon's Depth, Yet, never, for myself, my Tears sought Heaven; All, for my Children, rose my fruitless Prayers: Yet, what avails a Father's wretched Joy? I have a Daughter gain'd, and Heaven an Enemy. But, 'tis my Guilt, not hersâThy Father's Prison Depriv'd thee of thy Faithâyet, do not lose it:â Reclaim thy BirthrightâThink upon the Blood Of Twenty Christian Kings, that fills thy Veins; 'Tis Heroes' Bloodâthe Blood of Saints, and Martyrs! What wou'd thy Mother feel, to see thee, thus? She, and thy murder'd Brothers?âThink, they call thee; Think, that thou see'st 'em stretch their bloody Arms, And weep, to win thee, from their Murderers' Bosom. Ev'n, in the Place, where thou betray'st thy God, He dy'd, my Child, to save thee.âTurn thy Eyes, And see, for thou art near, his sacred Sepulchre; Thou can'st not move a Step, but where He trod! Thou tremblestâOh! admit me to thy Soul; Kill not thy aged, thy afflicted Father; Take not, thus soon, again, the Life thou gav'st him; Shame not thy Motherânor betray thy God.â 'Tis pastâRepentance dawns, in thy sweet Eyes; I see bright Truth, descending to thy Heart, And, now, my long-lost Child, is found, for ever. NERESTAN. O! doubly bless'd! a Sister, and a Soul, To be redeem'd, together! ZARA. O! my Father! Dear Author of my Life! inform me, teach me, What shou'd my Duty do? LUSIGNAN. By one short Word, To dry up all my Tears, and make Life welcome, Say, thou art Christianâ ZARA. SirâI am a Christian. LUSIGNAN. Receive her, gracious Heaven! and bless her, for it. Enter Orasmin. ORASMIN. Madam, the Sultan order'd me, to tell you, That he expects, you, instant, quit this Place, And bid your last Farewell, to these vile Christians: You, Captive Frenchmen, follow me;âfor you, It is my Task, to answer.â CHATILLON. Still, new Miseries! How cautious Man shou'd be, to say, I'm happy! LUSIGNAN. These are the Times, when Men of Virtue, prove, That, 'tis the Mind, not Blood, insures their Firmness. ZARA. Alas! SirâOh!â LUSIGNAN. Oh, you!âI dare not name you: Farewellâbut, come what may, besure, remember, You keep the fatal Secret:âfor the rest, Leave all to Heaven,âbe faithful, and be blest.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. OSMAN, and ORASMIN. OSMAN. Orasmin! this Alarm was false, and groundless; Lewis, no longer, turns his Arms, on Me: The French, grown weary, by a Length of Woes, Wish not, as once, to quit their fruitful Plains, And famish, on Arabia's desart Sands. Their Ships, 'tis true, have spread the Syrian Seas; And Lewis, hovering, o'er the Coast of Cyprus, Alarms the Fears of Asia;âBut, I've learnt, That, steering wide, from our unmenac'd Ports, He points his Thunder, at th'Egyptian Shore. There, let him war, and waste my Enemies; Their mutual Conflict will but fix my Throne.â Release those ChristiansâI restore their Freedom; 'Twill please their Master, nor can weaken Me: Transport 'em, at my Cost, to find their King; I wish, to have him know me: Carry thither, This Lusignan, whom, tell him, I restore, Because I cannot fear his Fame in Arms; But love him, for his Virtue, and his Blood. Tell him, my Father having conquer'd, twice, Condemn'd him to perpetual Chains; but I Have set him free, that I might triumph, more. ORASMIN. The Christians gain an Army, in His Name. OSMAN. I cannot fear a Soundâ ORASMIN. But, Sirâshou'd Lewisâ OSMAN. Tell Lewis, and the Worldâit shall be so: Zara propos'd it, and my Heart approves: Thy Statesman's Reason is too dull, for Love! Why wilt thou force me, to confess it all? Tho' I, to Lewis, send back Lusignan, I give him but to ZaraâI have griev'd her; And ow'd her the Atonement of this Joy. Thy false Advices, which, but now, misled My Anger, to confine those helpless Christians, Gave her a Pain, I feel, for Her, and Me: But I talk on, and waste the smiling Moments. For one long Hour, I, yet, defer my Nuptials; But, 'tis not lost, that Hour! 'twill all be Hers! She wou'd employ it, in a Conference, With that Nerestan, whom thou know'stâThat Christian! ORASMIN. And have you, Sir, indulg'd that strange Desire? OSMAN. What mean'st thou? they were Infant Slaves, together: Friends should part, kind, who are to meet no more; When Zara asks, I will refuse her nothing. Restraint was never made for those, we love; Down, with these Rigours, of the proud Seraglio; I hate its Lawsâwhere blind Austerity Sinks Virtue, to Necessity.âMy Blood Disclaims your Asian Jealousy;âI hold The fierce, free, Plainness, of my Scythian Ancestors; Their open Confidence, their honest Hate, Their Love, unfearing, and their Anger, told. Goâthe good Christian waitsâconduct him to her; Zara expects theeâWhat she wills, obey. [Exit Osman. ORASMIN. Ho! Christian! enterâwait, a Moment, here; Enter Nerestan. Zara will, soon, approachâI go, to find her. [Exit Orasmin. NERESTAN. In what a State, in what a Place, I leave her! O, Faith! O, Father! O! my poor, lost Sister! She's here!â Enter Zara. Thank Heaven, it is not, then, unlawful, To see you, yet, once more, my lovely Sister! Not All so happy!âWe, who met, but now, Shall never meet againâfor Lusignanâ We shall be Orphans, still, and want a Father. ZARA. Forbid it, Heaven! NERESTAN. His last, sad Hour's at Hand.â That Flow of Joy, which follow'd our Discovery, Too strong, and sudden, for his Age's Weakness, Wasting his Spirits, dry'd the Source of Life, And Nature yields him up, to Time's Demand: Shall he not die, in Peace?âOh! let no Doubt Disturb his parting Moments, with Distrust; Let me, when I return, to close his Eyes, Compose his Mind's Impatience, too, and tell him, You are confirm'd a Christian.â ZARA. O! may his Soul enjoy, in Earth, and Heaven, Eternal Rest! nor let one Thought, one Sigh, One bold Complaint, of mine, recall his Cares! But, You have injur'd me, who, still, can doubt.â What! am I not your Sister? and shall You Refuse me Credit? You suppose me light? You, who shou'd judge my Honour, by your own! Shall You distrust a Truth, I dar'd avow, And stamp Apostate, on a Sister's Heart! NERESTAN. Ah! do not misconceive me!âif I err'd, Affection, not Distrust, misled my Fear; Your Will may be a Christian, yet, not You: There is a sacred Markâa Sign, of Faith, A Pledge, of Promise, that must firm your Claim; Wash you from Guilt, and open Heaven, before you: Swear, swear, by all the Woes, we All have borne, By all the martyr'd Saints, who call you Daughter; That you consent, this Day, to seal your Faith, By that mysterious Rite, which waits your Call. ZARA. I swear, by Heaven, and all its holy Host, Its Saints, its Martyrs, its attesting Angels, And the dread Presence of its living Author, To have no Faith, but yours;âto die, a Christian! Now, tell me, what this mystick Faith requires? NERESTAN. To hate the Happiness of Osman's Throne, And love that God, who, thro' this Maze of Woes, Has brought us All, unhoping, thus, together; For meâI am a Soldier, uninstructed, Nor daring to instruct, tho' strong in Faith: But I will bring th'Ambassador of Heaven, To clear your Views, and lift you to your God: Be it your Task, to gain Admission for him.â But where? from whom?âOh! thou Immortal Power! Whence can we hope it, in this curs'd Seraglio? Who is this Slave of Osman?âYes, this Slave! Does she not boast the Blood of Twenty Kings? Is not her Race the same, with That, of Lewis? Is she not Lusignan's unhappy Daughter? A Christian? and my Sister?âyet, a Slave! A willing Slave!âI dare not speak, more plainly. ZARA. Cruel! go onâAlas! you know not Me! At once, a Stranger, to my secret Fate, My Pains, my Fears, my Wishes, and my Power: I amâI will be, Christianâwill receive This holy Priest, with his mysterious Blessing; I will nor do, nor suffer, aught, unworthy Myself, my Father, or my Father's Race.â But, tell meânor be tender, on this Point; What Punishment your Christian Laws decree, For an unhappy Wretch, who, to herself, Unknown, and, all abandon'd, by the World, Lost, and enslav'd, has, in her Sovereign Master, Found a Protector, Generous, as Great, Has touch'd his Heart, and giv'n him, all her own? NERESTAN. The Punishment of such a Slave, shou'd be Death, in This Worldâand Pain, in That to come. ZARA. I am that Slaveâstrike hereâand save my Shame: NERESTAN. Destruction to my Hopes!âCan it be you? ZARA. It isâador'd by Osman, I adore him: This Hour, the Nuptial Rites will make us, One. NERESTAN. What! marry Osman!âLet the World grow dark; That the extinguish'd Sun may hide thy Shame! Cou'd it be thus, it were no Crime to kill thee. ZARA. Strike, strikeâI love himâyes, by Heav'n! I love him. NERESTAN. Death is thy Dueâbut not thy Due, from Me: Yet, were the Honour of our House no Barâ My Father's Fame, and the too gentle Laws Of that Religion, which thou hast disgrac'dâ Did not the God, thou quit'st, hold back my Arms, Not thereâI cou'd not, there;âbut, by my Soul, I wou'd rush, desp'rate, to the Sultan's Breast, And plunge my Sword, in his proud Heart, who damns thee. Oh! Shame! Shame! Shame! at such a Time, as this! When Lewis, that Awak'ner of the World, Beneath the lifted Cross, makes Egypt pale, And draws the Sword of Heaven, to spread our Faith! Now, to submit to see my Sister, doom'd A Bosom Slave, to Him, whose Tyrant Heart But measures Glory, by the Christian's Woe! YesâI will dare acquaint our Father with it;â Departing Lusignan may live, so long, As just, to hear, thy Shame, and die, to 'scape it. ZARA. Stayâmy too angry Brother,âstayâperhaps, Zara has Resolution, great, as Thine: 'Tis cruelâand unkind!âThy Words are Crimes; My Weakness but Misfortune! Dost thou suffer? I suffer more;âOh! wou'd to Heaven, this Blood Of Twenty boasted Kings, wou'd stop, at once, And stagnate in my Heart!âIt, then, no more, Wou'd rush, in boiling Fevers, thro' my Veins, And ev'ry trembling Drop, be fill'd with Osman. How has he lov'd me! How has he oblig'd me! I owe Thee to him! What has he not done, To justify his boundless Pow'r of charming! For me, he softens the severe Decrees Of his own Faith;âAnd is it just, that mine Shou'd bid me hate him, but because he loves me? NoâI will be a Christianâbut, preserve My Gratitude, as sacred, as my Faith: If I have Death to fear, for Osman's sake, It must be, from his Coldness, not his Love. NERESTAN. I must, at once, condemn, and pity thee; I cannot point thee out, which Way to go, But Providence will lend its Light, to guide thee. That sacred Rite, which thou shalt, now, receive, Will strengthen, and support, thy feeble Heart, To live, an Innocent; or die, a Martyr: Here, then, begin Performance of thy Vow; Here, in the trembling Horrors of thy Soul, Promise thy King, thy Father, and thy God, Not to accomplish these detested Nuptials, Till, first, the reverend Priest has clear'd your Eyes, Taught you to know, and giv'n you Claim to, Heaven. Promise me Thisâ ZARA. So bless me, Heaven! I do.â Goâhasten the good Priest, I will expect him; But, first, returnâchear my expiring Father, Tell him, I am, and will be, All he wishes me: Tell him, to give Him Life, 'twere Joy, to die. NERESTAN. I goâfarewellâfarewell, unhappy Sister! [Exit Nerestan. ZARA. I am aloneâand, now, be just, my Heart! And tell me, Wilt thou dare betray thy God! What am I? What am I about to be? Daughter of Lusignan?âor Wife to Osman? Am I a Lover, most? or, most, a Christian? Wou'd Selima were come? and, yet, 'tis just, All Friends shou'd fly Her, who forsakes Herself: What shall I do?âWhat Heart has Strength, to bear These double Weights of Duty?âHelp me, Heaven! To thy hard Laws I render up my Soul: But, Oh! demand it backâfor, now 'tis Osman's.â Enter Osman. OSMAN. Shine out, appear, be found, my lovely Zara! Impatient Eyes attendâThe Rites expect thee; And my devoted Heart, no longer, brooks This Distance, from its Soft'ner!âAll the Lamps Of Nuptial Love are lighted, and burn pure, As if they drew their Brightness from thy Blushes; The holy Mosque is fill'd with fragrant Fumes, Which emulate the Sweetness of thy Breathing: My prostrate People, all, confirm my Choice, And send their Souls to Heaven, in Prayer, for Blessings. Thy envious Rivals, conscious of thy Right, Approve superior Charms, and join, to praise thee; The Throne, that waits thee, seems to shine, more richly, As all its Gems, with animated Lustre, Fear'd to look dim, beneath the Eyes of Zara! Come, my slow Love! the Ceremonies wait thee; Come, and begin, from this dear Hour, my Triumph. ZARA. Oh! what a Wretch am I? O, Grief! Oh, Love! OSMAN. Comeâcomeâ ZARA. Where shall I hide my Blushes? OSMAN. Blushes?âhere, in my Bosom, hide 'em.â ZARA. My Lord? OSMAN. Nay, Zaraâgive me thy Hand, and comeâ ZARA. Instruct me, Heaven! What I shou'd sayâAlas! I cannot speak: OSMAN. Awayâthis modest, sweet, reluctant, Trifling But doubles my Desires, and thy own Beauties! ZARA. Ah, me! OSMAN. Nayâbut thou should'st not be too cruelâ ZARA. I can, no longer, bear itâOh! my Lordâ OSMAN. Ha!âwhat!âwhence? how?â ZARA. My Lord! my Sovereign! Heaven knows, this Marriage wou'd have been a Bliss, Above my humble Hopes!âyet, witness Love! Not, from the Grandeur of your Throne, that Bliss, But, from the Pride of calling Osman, Mine, Wou'd, You had been no Emperor! and I, Possess'd of Power, and Charms, deserving You! That, slighting Asia's Thrones, I might, alone, Have left a proffer'd World, to follow You, Through Desarts, uninhabited by Men, And bless'd, with ample Room, for Peace, and Love! But, as it isâthese Christiansâ OSMAN. Christians! what! How start two Images into thy Thoughts, So distantâas the Christians, and my Love! ZARA. That good, old Christian, reverend Lusignan, Now, dying, ends his Life, and Woes, together! OSMAN. Well! let him dieâWhat has thy Heart to feel, Thus pressing, and thus tender, from the Death Of an old, wretched, Christian?âThank our Prophet, Thou art no Christian!âeducated, here, Thy happy Youth was taught our better Faith: Sweet, as thy Pity shines, 'tis, now, mistim'd; What! tho' an aged Suff'rer dies, unhappy, Why shou'd his foreign Fate disturb our Joys? ZARA. Sir, if you love me, and wou'd have me think, That I am, truly, dearâ OSMAN. Heaven! if I loveâ ZARA. Permit meâ OSMAN. What? ZARA. To desireâ OSMAN. Speak outâ ZARA. The Nuptial Rites May be deferr'd, tillâ OSMAN. What?âis That the Voice Of Zara? ZARA. Oh! I cannot bear his Frown! OSMAN. Of Zara!â ZARA. It is dreadful to my Heart, To give you but a seeming Cause, for Anger; Pardon my GriefâAlas! I cannot bear it; There is a painful Terror, in your Eye, That pierces to my Soulâhid, from your Sight, I go, to make a moment's Truce, with Tears, And gather Force, to speak of my Despair. [Exit disorder'd OSMAN. I stand, immoveable, like senseless Marble! Horror had frozen my suspended Tongue: And an astonish'd Silence robb'd my Will Of Power, to tell her, that she shock'd my Soul! Spoke she to Me?âsure! I misunderstood her! Cou'd it be Me, she left?âWhat have I seen? Enter Orasmin. Orasmin! What a Change is here!âShe's gone, And I permitted it, I know not how! ORASMIN. Perhaps, you but accuse the charming Fault Of Innocence, too modest, oft, in Love. OSMAN. But why, and whence, those Tears?âthose Looks! that Flight! That Grief! so strongly stamp'd, on every Feature! If it has been that Frenchman!âWhat a Thought! How low, how horrid, a Suspicion, That! The dreadful Flash, at once, gives Light, and kills me: My too bold Confidence repell'd my Caution; An Infidel!âa Slave!âa Heart, like mine, Reduc'd, to suffer, from so vile a Rival! But, tell me, did'st thou mark 'em, at their Parting? Did'st thou observe the Language of their Eyes? Hide nothing from meâIs my Love betray'd? Tell me my whole Disgrace: Nay, if thou tremblest, I hear thy Pity speak, tho' thou art silent. ORASMIN. I tremble, at the Pangs, I see you suffer; Let not your angry Apprehension urge Your faithful Slave, to irritate your Anguish; I did, 'tis true, observe some parting Tears; But, there are Tears, of Charity, and Grief: I cannot think, there was a Cause, deserving This Agony of Passionâ OSMAN. Why noâI thank theeâ Orasmin, thou art wise! It cou'd not be, That I shou'd stand, expos'd, to such an Insult: Thou know'st, had Zara meant me the Offence, She wants not Wisdom, to have bid it, better; How rightly did'st thou judge!âZara shall know it; And thank thy honest ServiceâAfter all, Might she not have some Cause for Tears, which I Claim no Concern inâbut the Grief it gives her? What an unlikely Fearâfrom a poor Slave! Who goes, to-morrow, and, no doubt, who wishes, Nay, who resolves, to see these Climes no more! ORASMIN. Why did you, Sir, against our Country's Custom, Indulge him, with a second Leave to come? He said, he shou'd return, once more, to see her. OSMAN. Return!âthe Traitor! He return!âDares he Presume, to press a second Interview? Wou'd he be seen, again?âHe shall be seen; But, dead;âI'll punish the audacious Slave, To teach the faithless Fair, to feel my Anger: Be still, my Transports; Violence is blind: I know, my Heart, at once, is fierce, and weak; I feel, that I descend, below myself; Zara can never, justly, be suspected; Her Sweetness was not form'd, to cover Treason: Yet, Osman must not stoop to Woman's Follies. Their Tears, Complaints, Regrets, and Reconcilements, With all their light, capricious, Roll of Changes, Are Arts, too vulgar, to be try'd on Me. It wou'd become me, better, to resume The Empire of my Will:âRather than fall Beneath myself, I must, how dear soe'er It costs me, riseâtill I look down, on Zara! Awayâbut mark meâthese Seraglio Doors, Against all Christians, be they, henceforth, shut, Close, as the dark Retreats of silent Death.â What have I done, just Heav'n! thy Rage to move, That thou shou'dst sink me down, so low, to Love? End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. ZARA, SELIMA. SELIMA. Ah! Madam, how, at once, I grieve your Fate, And, how admire your Vertue!âHeaven permits, And Heaven will give you Strength, to bear, Misfortune; To break these Chains, so strong, and, yet, so dear. ZARA. Oh! that I cou'd support the fatal Struggle! SELIMA. Th'Eternal aids your Weakness, sees your Will; Directs your Purpose, and rewards your Sorrows. ZARA. Never had Wretch more Cause, to hope, he does. SELIMA. What! tho' you, here, no more, behold your Father There is a Father to be found, above, Who can restore That Father to his Daughter. ZARA. But, I have planted Pain, in Osman's Bosom; He loves me, ev'n to Deathâand I reward him, With Anguish, and Despair:âHow base! how cruel! But I deserv'd him not, I shou'd have been Too happy, and the Hand of Heaven repell'd me. SELIMA. What! will you, then, regret the glorious Loss, And hazard, thus, a Vict'ry, bravely won? ZARA. Inhuman Victory!âthou dost not know, This Love, so pow'rful, this sole Joy of Life, This first, best, Hope of earthly Happiness, Is, yet, less pow'rful, in my Heart, than Heaven! To him, who made that Heart, I offer it; There, there, I sacrifice my bleeding Passion: I pour, before him, ev'ry guilty Tear; I beg him, to efface the fond Impression, And fill, with his own Image, all my Soul: But, while I weep, and sigh, repent, and pray, Remembrance brings the Object of my Love, And ev'ry light Illusion floats before him. I see, I hear him, and, again, he charms! Fills my glad Soul, and shines, 'twixt me, and Heav'n! O! all ye Royal Ancestors! Oh, Father! Mother! you Christians, and the Christian's God! You, who deprive me of this gen'rous Lover! If you permit me not to live for him, Let me not live, at all, and I am bless'd: Let me die, innocent; let his dear Hand Close the sad Eyes of her, he stoop'd to love, And I acquit my Fate, and ask no more. But he forgives me notâregardless, now, Whether, or how, I live, or, when I die, He quits me, scorns meâand I, yet live on, And talk of Death, as distant.â SELIMA. Ah! despair not, Trust your Eternal Helper, and be happy. ZARA. Whyâwhat has Osman done, that He, too, shou'd not? Has Heaven, so nobly, form'd his Heart, to hate it? Gen'rous, and Just, Beneficent, and Brave, Were he but Christianâwhat can Man be, more? I wish, methinks, this reverend Priest were come; To free me from these Doubts, which shake my Soul: Yet, know not, why I shou'd not dare to hope, That Heaven, whose Mercy All confess, and feel, Will pardon, and approve, th'Alliance wish'd: Perhaps, it seats me on the Throne of Syria, To tax my Pow'r, for these good Christians' Comfort. Thou know'st, the mighty Saladine, who, first, Conquer'd this Empire, from my Father's Race, Who, like my Osman, charm'd th'admiring World, Drew Birth, tho' Syrian, from a Christian Mother. SELIMA. What mean you, Madam! Ah! you do not see! ZARA. Yes, yesâI see it all; I am not blind: I see, my Country, and my Race, condemn me; I see, that, spite of all, I still, love Osman.â What! if I, now, go throw me at his Feet, And tell him, there, sincerely, what I am? SELIMA. ConsiderâThat might cost your Brother's Life, Expose the Christians, and betray you All: ZARA. You do not know the noble Heart of Osman; SELIMA. I know him the Protector of a Faith, Sworn Enemy to ours;âThe more he loves, The less will he permit you, to profess Opinions, which he hates: To Night, the Priest, In private, introduc'd, attends you, here; You promis'd him Admissionâ ZARA. Wou'd I had not! I promis'd, too, to keep this fatal Secret: My Father's urg'd Command requir'd it, twice; I must obey, all dangerous, as it is: Compell'd to Silence, Osman is enrag'd, Suspicion follows, and I lose his Love. Enter Osman. OSMAN. Madam! there was a Time, when my charm'd Heart Made it a Virtue, to be lost, in Love; When, without blushing, I indulg'd my Flame; And ev'ry Day, still, made you dearer to me. You taught me, Madam, to believe, my Love Rewarded, and return'dânor was that Hope, Methinks, too bold for Reason: Emperors, Who chuse to sigh, devoted, at the Feet Of Beauties, whom the World conceive their Slaves, Have Fortune's Claim, at least, to sure Success: But, 'twere profane to think of Pow'r, in Love: Dear, as my Passion makes you, I decline Possession of her Charms, whose Heart's Another's; You will not find me a weak, jealous, Lover, By coarse Reproaches giving Pain to you, And shaming my own Greatnessâwounded deeply, Yet shunning, and disdaining, low Complaint, I comeâto tell youâ ZARA. Give my trembling Heart A Moment's Respiteâ OSMAN. That unwilling Coldness, Is the just Prize of your capricious Lightness; Your ready Arts may spare the fruitless Pains, Of colouring Deceit with fair Pretences; I wou'd not wish to hear your slight Excuses; I cherish Ignorance, to save my Blushes. Osman, in ev'ry Trial, shall remember, That he is EmperorâWhate'er I suffer, 'Tis due to Honour, that I give up You, And, to my injur'd Bosom, take Despair, Rather than, shamefully, possess you, sighing, Convinc'd, those Sighs were, never, meant for Me.â Go, Madamâyou are freeâFrom Osman's Pow'r Expect no Wrongs, but see his Face no more. ZARA. At last, 'tis comeâthe fear'd, the murd'ring Moment Is comeâand I am curs'd by Earth, and Heaven! [Throws herself on the Ground. If it is true, that I am lov'd no more;â If youâ OSMAN. It is too true, my Fame requires it; It is too true, that I, unwilling, leave you: That I, at once, renounce you, and adore.â Zara!âyou weep!â ZARA. If I am doom'd to lose you, If I must wander o'er an empty World, Unloving, and unlov'dâOh! yet, do Justice To the Afflictedâdo not wrong me, doubly: Punish me, if 'tis needful to your Peace, But say not, I deserv'd itâThis, at least, Believeâfor, not the Greatness of your Soul Is Truth, more pure, and sacredâno Regret Can touch my bleeding Heart, for having lost The Rank, of Her, you raise to share your Throne: I know, I never ought to have been there; My Fate, and my Defects require, I lose you: But ah! my Heart was, never, known to Osman. May Heaven, that punishes, for ever hate me, If I regret the Loss of aught, but You. OSMAN. RiseâriseâThis means not Love? [Raises her. ZARA. StrikeâStrike me, Heaven! OSMAN. What! is it Love, to force yourself to wound The Heart, you wish to gladden?âBut I find, Lovers, least know Themselves, for, I believ'd, That I had taken back the Power I gave you; Yet, see!âyou did but weep, and have resum'd me! Proud, as I amâI must confess, one Wish Evades my Powerâthe Blessing to forget you. ZaraâThy Tears were form'd to teach Disdain, That Softness can disarm it.â'Tis decreed, I must, for ever, loveâbut, from what Cause, If thy consenting Heart partakes my Fires, Art thou reluctant to a Blessing, meant me? Speak? Is it Levityâor, is it Fear? Fear of a Power, that, but for blessing Thee, Had, without Joy, been painful.âIs it Artifice? Oh! spare the needless PainsâArt was not made For Zara;âArt, however innocent, Looks like Deceiving:âI abhorr'd it, ever. ZARA. Alas! I have no Art, not ev'n enough, To hide this Love, and this Distress, you give me. OSMAN. New Riddles! speak, with Plainness, to my Soul; What can'st thou mean? ZARA. I have no Power to speak it. OSMAN. Is it some Secret, dang'rous to my State? Is it some Christian Plot, grown ripe, against me? ZARA. Lives there a Wretch, so vile, as to betray you! Osman is bless'd, beyond the Reach of Fear; Fears, and Misfortunes, threaten only Zara. OSMAN. Why threaten Zara? ZARA. Permit me, at your Feet, Thus, trembling, to beseech a Favour from you. OSMAN. A Favour!âOh! you guide the Will of Osman. ZARA. Ah! wou'd to Heaven, our Duties were united, Firm, as our Thoughts and Wishes!âBut This Day, But This one sad, unhappy Day, permit me, Alone, and far-divided, from your Eye, To cover my Distress, lest you, too tender, Shou'd see, and share it with meâfrom To-morrow, I will not have a Thought, conceal'd from you. OSMAN. What strange Disquiet! from what stranger Cause? ZARA. If I am, really, bless'd with Osman's Love, He will not, then, refuse this humble Prayer. OSMAN. If it must be, it must.âBe pleas'dâmy Will Takes Purpose, from your Wishes;âAnd, Consent Depends, not on my Choice, but your Decree: Goâbut remember, how He loves, who thus, Finds a Delight in Pain, because you give it. ZARA. It gives me more than Pain, to make you feel it. OSMAN. Andâcan you, Zara, leave me? ZARA. Alas! my Lord! [Exit Zara. OSMAN. [Alone.] It shou'd be, yet, methinks, too soon to fly me! Too soon, as yet, to wrong my easy Faith; The more I think, the less can I conceive, What hidden Cause shou'd raise such strange Despair! Now, when her Hopes have Wings, and ev'ry Wish Is courted to be lively!âWhen I love, And Joy, and Empire, press her to their Bosom; When, not alone belov'd, but, ev'n, a Lover: Professing, and accepting; bless'd, and blessing; To see her Eyes, thro' Tears, shine mystick Love! 'Tis Madness! and I were unworthy Power, To suffer, longer, the capricious Insult! Yet, was I blameless?âNoâI was too rash; I have felt Jealousy, and spoke it, to her; I have distrusted herâand, still, she loves: Gen'rous Atonement, That! and 'tis my Duty To expiate, by a Length of soft Indulgence, The Transports of a Rage, which, still, was Love. Henceforth, I, never, will suspect her false; Nature's plain Power of Charming dwells about her, And Innocence gives Force to ev'ry Word: I owe full Confidence to All, she looks, For, in her Eye, shines Truth, and ev'ry Beam Shoots Confirmation round her:âI remark'd, Ev'n, while she wept, her Soul, a thousand times, Sprung to her Lips, and long'd to leap to mine, With honest, ardent, Utt'rance of her Love.â Who can possess a Heart, so low, so base, To look such Tenderness, and, yet, have none? Enter Melidor, with Orasmin. MELIDOR. This Letter, great Disposer of the World! Address'd to Zara, and, in private, brought, Your faithful Guards, this Moment, intercepted, And, humbly, offer to your Sovereign Eye. OSMAN. Come nearer; give it me.âTo Zara!âRise! Bring it, with SpeedâShame on your flatt'ring Distanceâ [Advancing, and snatching the Letter. Be honestâand approach me, like a Subject, Who serves the Prince, yet, not forgets the Man. MELIDOR. One of the Christian Slaves, whom, late, your Bounty Releas'd from Bondage, sought, with heedful Guile, Unnotic'd, to deliver itâdiscover'd, He waits, in Chains, his Doom; from your Decree. OSMAN. Leave meâI tremble, as if something fatal, Were meant me, from this Letterâshou'd I read it? ORASMIN. Who knows, but it contains some happy Truth, That may remove all Doubts, and calm your Heart? OSMAN. Be it, as 'twillâit shall be readâmy Hands Have Apprehension, that outreaches mine! Why shou'd they tremble, thus?â'Tis doneâand now, [Opens the Letter. Fate, be thy Call obey'dâOrasmin, markâ âThere is a secret Passage, towards the Mosque, âThat Way, you might escape; and, unperceiv'd, âFly your Observers, and fulfill our Hope; âDespise the Danger, and depend on me, âWho wait you, but, to die, if you deceive. Hell! Tortures! Death! and Woman!âWhat? Orasmin? Are we awake? Heard'st thou? Can this be Zara? ORASMIN. Wou'd, I had lost all Senseâfor, what I heard; Has cover'd my afflicted Heart with Horror! OSMAN. Thou see'st, how I am treated? ORASMIN. Monstrous Treason! To an Affront, like This, you cannotâmust notâ Remain, insensibleâYou, who, but now, From the most slight Suspicion, felt such Pain, Must, in the Horror of so black a Guilt, Find an effectual Cure, and banish Love. OSMAN. Seek her, this InstantâgoâOrasmin, flyâ Shew her this Letterâbid her read, and tremble: Then, in the rising Horrors of her Guilt, Stab her unfaithful Breastâand let her die.â Say, while thou strik'stâStay, stayâreturn, and pity me: I will think, first, a MomentâLet that Christian Be, strait, confronted with herâStayâI will, I willâI know not what;âWou'd, I were dead! Wou'd, I had dy'd, unconscious of this Shame! ORASMIN. Never did Prince receive so bold a Wrong. OSMAN. See! here, detected, this infernal Secret! This Fountain of her Tears, which my weak Heart Mistook, for Marks of Tenderness, and Pain! Why! what a Reach has Woman, to deceive! Under how fine a Veil, of Grief, and Fear, Did she propose Retirement, till To-morrow! And I, blind Dotard! gave the Fool's Consent, Sooth'd her, and suffer'd her to go!âShe parted, Dissolv'd in Tears; and parted, to betray me! ORASMIN. Reflexion serves but to confirm her Guilt: At length, resume Yourself; awaken Thought; Assert your Greatness; and resolve, like Osman. OSMAN. Nerestan, too!âWas this the boasted Honour Of that proud Christian? whom Jerusalem Grew loud, in Praising! whose half-envy'd Virtue I wonder'd at, myself! and felt Disdain, To be but, equal, to a Christian's Greatness! And does he thank me thus?âbase Infidel! Honest, pretending, pious; praying, Villain! Yet, Zara is, a thousand times, more base, More Hypocrite, than He!âa Slave! a Wretch! So low, so lost, that, ev'n the vilest Labours, In which he lay, condemn'd, cou'd never sink him, Beneath his Native Infamy!âDid she not know, What I have done, what suffer'dâfor Her sake? ORASMIN. Cou'd you, my gracious Lord! forgive my Zeal! You wou'dâ OSMAN. I know itâThou art rightâI'll see her; I'll tax her, in thy Presence;âI'll upbraid herâ I'll let her learnâgoâfind, and bring her, to me. ORASMIN. Alas! my Lord, disorder'd, as you are, What can you wish to say? OSMAN. I know not, now:â But I resolve to see herâlest she think, Her Falshood has, perhaps, the Power to grieve me. ORASMIN. Believe me, Sir, your Threatnings, your Complaints, What will they All produce, but Zara's Tears, To quench this fansy'd Anger! your lost Heart, Seduc'd, against itself, will search but Reasons, To justify the Guilt, which gives it Pain: Rather conceal, from Zara, this Discovery; And let some trusty Slave convey the Letter, Reclos'd, to her own Handâthen, shall you learn, Spite of her Frauds, Disguise, and Artifice, The Firmness, or Abasement, of her Soul. OSMAN. Thy Counsel charms me! We'll about it, now: 'Twill be some Recompence, at least, to see Her Blushes, when detected.â ORASMIN. Oh! my Lord, I doubt you, in the Trialâfor, your Heartâ OSMAN. Distrust me notâmy Love, indeed, is weak, But, Honour, and Disdain, more strong than Zara: Here, take this fatal Letterâchuse a Slave, Whom, yet, she never saw, and who retains His try'd FidelityâDispatchâbe goneâ [Exit Orasmin. Now, whither shall I turn my Eyes, and Steps, The surest way, to shun her; and give Time For this discovering Trial?âHeav'n! she's here! Enter Zara. So, Madam! Fortune will befriend my Cause, And free me from your Fetters:âYou are met, Most aptly, to dispell a new-ris'n Doubt, That claims the finest of your Arts, to gloss it. Unhappy, each, by other, it is Time, To end our mutual Pain, that Both may rest: You want not Generosity, but Love; My Pride forgotten, my obtruded Throne, My Favours, Cares, Respect, and Tenderness, Touching your Gratitude, provok'd Regard; Till, by a Length of Benefits, besieg'd, Your Heart submitted, and you thought, 'twas Love; But, you deceiv'd Yourself, and injur'd me. There is, I'm told, an Object, more deserving Your Love, than OsmanâI wou'd know his Name? Be just, nor trifle with my Anger: Tell me, Now, while expiring Pity struggles, faint; While I have yet, perhaps, the Pow'r to pardon: Give up the bold Invader of my Claim, And let him die, to save thee.âThou art known; Think, and resolveâWhile I yet speak, renounce him; While yet the Thunder rolls, suspended, stop it; Let thy Voice charm me, and recall my Soul, That turns, averse, and dwells no more on Zara. ZARA. Can it be Osman, speaks? and speaks to Zara? Learn, Cruel! learn, that this afflicted Heart, This Heart, which Heaven delights to prove, by Tortures, Did it not love, has Pride, and Pow'r, to shun you: Alas! you will not know me! What have I To fear, but that unhappy Love, you question? That Love, which, only, cou'd outweigh the Shame, I feel, while I descend, to weep my Wrongs: I know not, whether Heaven, that frowns upon me, Has destin'd my unhappy Days, for Yours; But, be my Fate, or bless'd, or curs'd, I swear, By Honour, dearer ev'n than Life, or Love, Cou'd Zara be but Mistress of Herself, She wou'd, with cold Regard, look down on Kings, And, You alone excepted, fly 'em all: Wou'd you learn more, and open all my Heart? Know then, that, spite of this renew'd Injustice, I do notâcannotâwish to love you less: That, long before you look'd so low, as Zara, She gave her Heart to OsmanâYours, before Your Benefits had bought her, or your Eye Had thrown Distinction round her; never had, Nor ever will acknowledge, other Lover.â And, to this sacred Truth, attesting Heaven! I call thy dreadful Notice! If my Heart Deserves Reproach, 'tis for, but not from, Osman. OSMAN. What! does she, yet, presume to swear Sincerity! Oh! Boldness of unblushing Perjury! Had I not seen, had I not read, such Proof, Of her light Falshood, as extinguish'd Doubt, I cou'd not be a Man, and not believe her. ZARA. Alas! my Lord, what cruel Fears have seiz'd you? What harsh, mysterious Words were those, I heard? OSMAN. What Fears shou'd Osman feel, since Zara loves him! ZARA. I cannot live, and answer to your Voice, In that reproachful Tone!âYour angry Eye Trembles with Fury, while you talk of Love! OSMAN. Since Zara LOVES him! ZARA. Is it possible, Osman should disbelieve it?âAgain, again, Your late-repented Violence returns; Alas! what killing Frowns you dart against me! Can it be kind? Can it be just, to doubt me? OSMAN. NoâI can doubt no longerâYou may retire. [Exit Zara. Re-enter Orasmin. Orasmin! she's perfidious, ev'n beyond Her Sex's undiscover'd Power of Seeming: She's at the topmost Point of shameless Artifice; An Empress, at Deceiving!âSoft, and easy, Destroying, like a Plague, in calm Tranquillity: She's innocent, she swearsâSo is the Fire; It shines, in harmless Distance, bright, and pleasing, Consuming nothing, till it, first, embraces.â Say? Hast thou chos'n a Slave?âIs he instructed? Haste, to detect her Vileness, and my Wrongs. ORASMIN. Punctual, I have obey'd your whole Command; But, have you arm'd, my Lord, your injur'd Heart, With Coldness, and Indiff'rence? Can you hear, All painless, and unmov'd, the False One's Shame? OSMAN. Orasmin! I adore her, more than ever! ORASMIN. My Lord! my Emperor! forbid it, Heaven! OSMAN. I have discern'd a Gleam of distant Hope; This hateful Christian, the light Growth of France, Proud, young, vain, amorous, conceited, rash, Has misconceiv'd some charitable Glance, And judg'd it Love, in Zara:âHe, alone, Then, has offended me.âIs it her Fault, If Those, she charms, are indiscreet, and daring? Zara, perhaps, expected not this Letter; And I, with Rashness, groundless, as its Writer's, Took Fire, at my own Fancy, and have wrong'd her. Now, hear me, with AttentionâSoon as Night Has thrown her welcome Shadows, o'er the Palace; When this Nerestan, this ungrateful Christian, Shall lurk, in Expectation, near our Walls, Be watchful, that our Guards surprize, and seize him; Then, bound in Fetters, and o'erwhelm'd, with Shame, Conduct the daring Traitor, to my Presence; But, above all, be sure, you hurt not Zara: Mindful, to what supreme Excess, I love. I feel, I must confess, a kind of Shame, And blush, at my own Tenderness;âbut, Faith, Howe'er it seems deceiv'd, were weak, as I am, Cou'd it admit Distrust, to blot its Face, And give Appearance Way, till Proof takes Place.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. ZARA, and SELIMA. ZARA. Sooth me, no longer, with this vain Desire; To a Recluse, like me, who dares, henceforth, Presume Admission!âThe Seraglio's shutâ Barr'd, and unpassableâas Death, to Time! My Brother ne'er must hope to see me, more:â How now! what unknown Slave accosts us, here! Enter Melidor. MELIDOR. This Letter, trusted to my Hands, receive, In secret Witness, I am, wholly, yours. [Zara reads the Letter. SELIMA. [Aside.] Thou, everlasting Ruler of the World! Shed thy wish'd Mercy on our hopeless Tears; Redeem us from the Hands of hated Infidels, And save my Princess from the Breast of Osman. ZARA. I wish, my Friend, the Comfort of your Counsel. SELIMA. Retireâyou shall be call'dâwait nearâGo, leave us: [Exit Melidor. ZARA. Read thisâand tell me, what I ought to answer? For I wou'd, gladly, hear my Brother's Voice, SELIMA. Say rather, you wou'd hear the Voice of Heav'n. 'Tis not your Brother, calls you, but your God. ZARA. I know it, nor resist his awful Will; Thou know'st, that I have bound my Soul, by Oath; But, can Iâought Iâto engage myself, My Brother, and the Christians, in this Danger? SELIMA. 'Tis not their Danger, that alarms your Fear; Your Love speaks loudest, to your shrinking Soul; I know your Heart, of Strength, to hazard All, But, it has let in Traitors, who surrender, On poor Pretence of Safety:âLearn, at least, To understand, the Weakness, that deceives you: You tremble, to offend your haughty Lover, Whom Wrongs, and Outrage, but endear the more; Yesâyou are blind to Osman's cruel Nature, That Tartar's Fierceness, that obscures his Bounties: This Tyger, savage, in his Tenderness, Courts, with Contempt, and threatens, amidst Softness; Yet, cannot your neglected Heart efface His fated, fix'd, Impression! ZARA. What Reproach Can I, with Justice, make him?âI, indeed, Have given Him Cause to hate me!â Was not his Throne, was not his Temple, ready? Did not he court his Slave, to be a Queen? And have not I declin'd it?âI, who ought To tremble, conscious of affronted Power! Have not I triumph'd o'er his Pride, and Love? Seen him submit his own high Will, to mine? And sacrifice his Wishes, to my Weakness? SELIMA. Talk we, no more, of this unhappy Passion: What Resolution will your Vertue take? ZARA. All things combine, to sink me to Despair: From the Seraglio, Death, alone, will free me. I long to see the Christians' happy Climes; Yet, in the Moment, while I form that Prayer, I sigh a secret Wish, to languish, here: How sad a State is mine! my restless Soul All ign'rant, what to do, or what to wish? My only Perfect Sense is, That of Pain. O, Guardian Heaven! protect my Brother's Life: For I will meet him, and fulfill his Prayer. Then, when, from Solyma's unfriendly Walls, His Absence shall unbind his Sister's Tongue, Osman shall learn the Secret of my Birth, My Faith unshaken, and my deathless Love; He will approve my Choice, and pity me. I'll send my Brother Word, he may expect me; Call in the faithful SlaveâGod of my Father's! [Exit Selima. Let thy Hand save me, and thy Will direct. Enter Selima, and Melidor. Goâtell the Christian, who intrusted thee, That Zara's Heart is fix'd, nor shrinks at Danger; And, that my faithful Friend will, at the Hour, Expect, and introduce him, to his Wish. Awayâthe Sultan comes; he must not find us. [Exeunt Zara and Selima. Enter Osman, and Orasmin. OSMAN. Swifter, ye Hours, move on; my Fury glows Impatient, and wou'd push the Wheels of Time:â How now! What Message dost thou bring? Speak boldlyâ What Answer gave she, to the Letter, sent her? MELIDOR. She blush'd, and trembled, and grew pale, and paus'd; Then blush'd, and read it; and, again, grew pale; And wept, and smil'd, and doubted, and resolv'd: For, after all this Race of vary'd Passions, When she had sent me out, and call'd me back, Tell him (she cry'd) who has intrusted thee, That Zara's Heart is fix'd, nor shrinks at Danger; And, that my faithful Friend will, at the Hour, Expect, and introduce him, to his Wish. OSMAN. Enoughâbe goneâI have no Ear for more.â [To the Slave. Leave me, Thou too, Orasmin.âLeave me Life, [To Orasmin. For, ev'ry Mortal Aspect moves my Hate: Leave me, to my DistractionâI grow mad, And cannot bear the Visage of a Friend. Leave me, to Rage, Despair, and Shame, and Wrongs, Leave me, to seek Myselfâand shun Mankind. [Alone. Who am I?âHeav'n! Who am I? What resolve I? Zara! Nerestan! Sound those Words, like Names Decreed to join!âWhy pause I?âPerish Zaraâ Wou'd, I cou'd tear her Image, from my Heart:â 'Twere happier, not to live, at all, than live Her Scorn, the Sport of an ungrateful False One! And sink the Sovereign, in a Woman's Property. Re-enter Orasmin. Orasmin!âFriend! returnâI cannot bear This Absence, from thy Reason: 'Twas unkind, 'Twas cruel, to obey me, thus distress'd, And wanting Pow'r to think, when I had lost thee. How goes the Hour? Has he appear'd? This Rival! Perish the shameful SoundâThis Villain Christian! Has he appear'd, below? ORASMIN. Silent, and dark, Th'unbreathing World is hush'd, as if it heard, And listen'd to, your Sorrows. OSMAN. O, treach'rous Night! Thou lend'st thy ready Veil, to ev'ry Treason, And teeming Mischiefs thrive, beneath thy Shade. Orasmin! Prophet! Reason! Truth! and Love! After such Length of Benefits, to wrong me! How have I over-rated, how mistaken, The Merit of her Beauty!âDid I not Forget, I was a Monarch? Did I remember, That Zara was a Slave?âI gave up All; Gave up Tranquillity, Distinction, Pride, And fell, the shameful Victim of my Love! ORASMIN. Sir! Sovereign! Sultan! my Imperial Master! Reflect on your own Greatness, and disdain The distant Provocation.â OSMAN. Heard'st thou nothing? ORASMIN. My Lord? OSMAN. A Noise, like Dying Groans? ORASMIN. I listen, but can hear nothing. OSMAN. Again!âlook outâhe comes.â ORASMIN. Nor Tread of Mortal Footânor Voice, I hear:â The still Seraglio lies, profoundly plung'd, In Deathlike Silence! nothing stirs.âThe Air Is soft, as Infants' Sleep; no breathing Wind Steals, thro' the Shadows, to awaken Night. OSMAN. Horrors, a thousand times more dark, than these, Benight my suff'ring SoulâThou dost not know, To what Excess of Tenderness, I lov'd her. I knew no Happiness, but what she gave me, Nor cou'd have felt a Mis'ry, but for her! Pity this Weaknessâmine are Tears, Orasmin! That fall not oft, nor lightly:â ORASMIN. Tears!âOh, Heaven! OSMAN. The first, which, ever, yet, unmann'd my Eyes! O! pity Zaraâpity MeâOrasmin, These but forerun the Tears of destin'd Blood. ORASMIN. Oh, my unhappy Lord! I tremble for Youâ OSMAN. Doâtremble at my Suff'rings, at my Love; At my Revenge, too, trembleâfor, 'tis due, And will not be deluded. ORASMIN. Hark! I hear The Steps of Men, along the neighb'ring Wall!â OSMAN. Flyâseize himâ'tis Nerestan! wait no Chains, But, drag him down, to my impatient Eye. [Exit Oras. Enter Zara and Selima, in the Dark. ZARA. Where art thou, Selima? Give me thy Hand; It is so dark, I tremble, as I step, With Fears, and Startings, never felt, 'till now! OSMAN. Damnation! 'tis Her Voice! the well-known Sound, That has, so often, charm'd me into Baseness! Oh! the perfidious Hypocrite!âshe goes, To meet th'inviting Infidel!ânow, now, [Drawing a Dagger. Revenge, stand firm, and intercept his Wishes:â Revenge! on whom?âno matterâEarth, and Heaven, Wou'd blush, shou'd I forbear:âNowâZara, now; [Drops the Dagger. I must notâcannot strike, the starting Steel, Unwilling, flies my Hand, and shuns to wound her. ZARA. This is the private Pathâcome nearer, lead meâ Are we not notic'd, think'st thou? SELIMA. Fear not, Madam; It cannot, now, be long, ere we shall meet him. OSMAN. That Word has giv'n me, back, my ebbing Rage; [Recovers the Dagger. ZARA. I walk in Terror, and my Heart forebodes: Who's there?âNerestan! Is it you!âOh! Welcomeâ OSMAN. [Stabbing her.] This to thy Heartâ'Tis not the Traitor, meets thee, 'Tis the Betray'dâwho writes it, in thy Blood. ZARA. O, gracious Heaven! receive my parting Soul. [Dies. OSMAN. Soul?âthen Revenge has reach'd theeâI will, now, Haste, from this fatal PlaceâI cannot leave her! Whom did I strike? Was This the Act of Love? Swallow me, Earth!âShe's silentâZara's dead! And, shou'd I live, to see returning Day, 'Twill shew me but her Blood!âshew me, left joyless, In a wide, empty, World, with nothing round me, But Penitence, and Painâand, yet, 'twas just:â Hark!âDestiny has sent her Lover to me, To fill my Vengeance, and restore my Joy. Enter Orasmin, with Nerestan. Approach, thou Wretch! thou more than curs'd! come nearâ Thou! who, in Gratitude, for Freedom gain'd, Hast given Me Miseries, beyond thy own! Thou Heart of Heroe, with a Traitor's Soul! Goâreap thy due Reward, prepare to suffer, Whate'er inventive Malice can inflict, To make Thee feel thy Death, and perish, slow. Are my Commands obey'd? ORASMIN. All is prepar'd: OSMAN. Thy wanton Eyes look round, in Search of Her, Whose Love, descending to a Slave, like Thee, From my dishonour'd Hand, receiv'd her Doom? See! where she liesâ NERESTAN. O, fatal, rash, Mistake! OSMAN. Dost thou behold her, Slave? NERESTAN. Unhappy Sister! OSMAN. Sister!âDid'st thou say Sister? if thou did'st, Bless me, with Deafness, Heaven! NERESTAN. Tyrant! I didâ She was my SisterâAll, that, now, is left thee, DispatchâFrom my distracted Heart, drain, next, The Remnant of the Royal, Christian, Blood: Old Lusignan, expiring, in my Arms, Sent his too wretched Son, with his last Blessing, To his, now, murder'd Daughter!â Wou'd, I had seen the bleeding Innocent! I wou'd have liv'd, to speak to her, in Death; Wou'd have awaken'd, in her languid Heart, A livelier Sense of her abandon'd God: That God, who, left by Her, forsook Her, too, And gave the poor, lost, Suff'rer, to thy Rage. OSMAN. Thy Sister?âLusignan, her FatherâSelima! Can this be true?âand have I wrong'd thee, Zara? SELIMA. Thy Love was all the Cloud, 'twixt her, and Heav'n OSMAN. Be dumbâfor thou art base, to add Distraction, To my, already, more, than bleeding, Heart: And was thy Love sincere?âWhat, then, remains? NERESTAN. Why shou'd a Tyrant hesitate, on Murder! There, now, remains, but mine, of all the Blood, Which, thro' thy Father's cruel Reign, and Thine, Has, never, ceas'd to stream, on Syria's Sands; Restore a Wretch to his unhappy Race; Nor hope, that Torments, after such a Scene, Can force one feeble Groan, to feast thy Anger. I waste my fruitless Words, in empty Air; The Tyrant, o'er the bleeding Wound, he made, Hangs his unmoving Eye, and heeds not me. OSMAN. O, Zara!â ORASMIN. Alas! my Lord, returnâwhither wou'd Grief Transport your gen'rous Heart?âThis Christian Dogâ OSMAN. Take off his Fetters, and observe my Will: To Him, and all his Friends, give instant Liberty: Pour a Profusion, of the richest Gifts, On these unhappy Christians; and, when heap'd, With vary'd Benefits, and charg'd, with Riches, Give 'em safe Conduct, to the nearest Port. ORASMIN. But, Sir!â OSMAN. Reply not, but obey.â Flyânor dispute thy Master's last Command, Thy Prince, who ordersâand thy Friend, who loves thee! Goâlose no Timeâfarewelâbe goneâand thou! Unhappy Warrior!âyet, less lost, than I!â Haste, from our bloody Landâand, to thy own, Convey this poor, pale, Object of my Rage: Thy King, and all his Christians, when they hear Thy Miseries, shall mourn 'em, with their Tears; But, if thou tell'st 'em mine, and tell'st 'em, truly, They, who shall hate my Crime, shall pity Me. Take, too, this Poniard, with thee, which my Hand Has stain'd with Blood, far dearer, than my own; Tell 'emâwith This, I murder'd, Her, I lov'd; The noblest, and most vertuous, among Women! The Soul of Innocence, and Pride of Truth! Tell 'em, I laid my Empire at her Feet; Tell 'em, I plung'd my Dagger in her Blood; Tell 'em, I so ador'dâand, thus, reveng'd her, [Stabs himself. Rev'rence this Heroeâand, conduct him, safe. [Dies. NERESTAN. Direct me, Great Inspirer of the Soul! How I shou'd act, how judge, in this Distress? Amazing Grandeur! and detested Rage! Ev'n I, amidst my Tears, admire this Foe, And mourn his Death, who liv'd, to give me Woe. End of the Fifth Act.</field>

Here, take a Surfeit, Sirs, of being Jealous; And shun the Pains, that plague those Turkish Fellows: Where Love and Death join Hands, their Darts confounding, Save us, good Heav'n! from this new Way of Wounding! Curs'd Climate!âwhere, to Cards, a lone-left Woman Has only, One of her Black-Guards, to summon! Sighs, and sits mope'd, with her tame Beast to gaze at: And, that cold Treat, is all the Game she plays at! Forâshou'd she once, some Abler Hand be trying, Poignard's the Word!âand, the first Deal isâDying! 'Slife! shou'd the bloody Whim get Ground, in Britain, Where Woman's Freedom has such Heights, to sit on; Daggers, PROVOK'D, wou'd bring on Desolation: And, murder'd Belles un-people half the Nation!â Fain wou'd I help this Play, to move Compassion; And live, to hunt Suspicion out of Fashion.â Four Motives, strongly recommend, to Lovers, Hate of this Weakness, that our Scene discovers: First thenâA Woman Will, or Won'tâdepend on't: If she will do't, she Will:âand, there's an End on't. But, if she won't,âsince safe and sound your Trust is, Fear is Affront: and Jealousy Injustice. Next,âHe who bids his Dear do, what she pleases, Blunts Wedlock's Edge; and, all its Torture eases: Forânot to feel your Suff'rings, is the same, As not to suffer:âAll the Diff'renceâName. ThirdlyâThe Jealous Husband wrongs his Honour; No Wife goes Lame, without some Hurt upon Her: And, the malicious World will still be guessing, Who, oft, Dines out, dislikes her own Cook's Dressing. Fourthly, and lastlyâto conclude my Lecture, If you wou'd FIX th'inconstant WifeâRESPECT her. She who perceives her Vertues OVER-RATED, Will fear to have th'Account more justly stated: And, borr'wing, from her Pride, the Good Wife's Seeming, Grow REALLY Suchâto Merit your Esteeming.
