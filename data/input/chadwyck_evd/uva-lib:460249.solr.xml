      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE TO THE KING, At the Cockpit at White-Hall. Sir, by the humble Writer I am sent To move you in a Suit by President, That you will please, like Charles the 5th, to lay Aside (this Night) the Business of the Day, And look upon slight Images, far short Of those presented in that Emp'rour's Court; For, Art does not our Powr so far inlarge, That we can make two wooden armies charge, Or a carv'd Sparrow fly: but we do bring A Nightingale, sweet Philomel to sing: And from old Verulam ('mong Time's Decayes Shrunk to a name) th'Inhabitants we raise, Who if in their new life they may invite The best of CÃ¦sars to the least Delight, To th Authour 'twill be such a Joy, as none Conceive, but only those You smile upon,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE To the STAGE. What's here? so many Noble Persons met? Nay then I see, this House will not be let, Which by our Friends (from all parts of the Nation) Is so well warm'd after the long Vacation, Believe me, Ladies, the pure Country-air Has made you fresh-complexion'd; and our Care Shall be (whil'st you'r in London) to expell Care from your hearts, that you may still look well. Gentlemen, when we lay becalm'd, you wa'k'd Over the pleasant Meades, bowl'd, hunted, hawk'd, And having exercis'd your Bodies thus, To recreate your Minds, you come to Us. Never were Friends more welcomeâif I may Be bold to bid you welcome to a Play. Of your own making; I confess, 'tis writ By th'Authour of The Slighted Maid, and yet You'r th'Authours of it: for I heard him say, When you encourag'd that, you made this Play. And now, since to your selves your title's known, We hope, you'l have a kindness for your Own.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Enter Filamor and Fromund in a Garden, Tetrick walking alone, and reading. Fil. No, Fromund, I have had too many proofs Of thy Fidelity, to doubt it now. Fro. Sir, if you were not Filamor, nor Son To my Prince, if I were not your sworn Servant; Without relation, meerly for your Virtues, Fromund would sacrifice his life to serve you In this Design against your Step-Mother, Your envious and imperious Step-Mother, Who rules your Father, and would ruine You. Fil. The difficulty of the work will be, When we have got my Father to the Woods, How we shall keep him there: for since he marry'd This Woman, she has master'd both his Courage And Reason; she governs his very Soul, He cannot live without her. Fro. There's the man Whose pow'r can ballance hers, for your Old Father Dotes but on two, his Wife and that great Scholar My Friend. Fil. And you can make him ours. Fro. Not I, What I am to present him from your Highness Will make him Yours. Fil. Firm? Fro. If he once ingages Nothing can alter him, he's an honest man, Peevish, but (to our comfort) Covetous: Yet he'l not take a Bribe to do unjustly; But if he be imploy'd, he will be pay'd, This Gold and this rich Book will sweeten him. Fil. Attacque him; I wait for my severe Mistress, 'Tis Princess CÃ¦sarina's walking-time. [Exit Filamor. [Fromund claps Tetrick on the Back. Tetrick. The Prince's Tutor? Well return'd to Britain. Fro. Our good old Master's Favorite, learn'd Tetrick. Tet. Out of what Region have the Clowds dropt Fromund? Where all this while wert thou and our young Prince? Fro. We liv'd where Grapes grow, like our Crabs, in hedges, Where every Tree looks lovelier then this Garden, In Italy, the Paradise of Nature. Tet. The plague of War consume your Paradise; The Galls over-run Italy again; Ten thousand Dropsies, Cramps and Gouts torment That leg of earth. Fro. Still snarling my friend Tetrick? Tet. Men may well snarle when they are us'd like Dogs, As we have been, by our Italian Masters. Fro. But now the Roman Legions are call'd back, And we are free-men, Britain is old Britain. Tet. But Italy is still curs'd Italy, I would not hear thee praise it any more, For twenty pieces of Imperial Gold. Fro. I'l try what pow'r one piece has over you. [aside. This Medall (CÃ¦sar grav'd in gold) I brought From Rome for thee: and is not Italy (Where these Flowers grow) a most delicious Country? Tet. The Garden of the World! how blind was I, That could not see the Beauty of Italy Till I had wip'd my eyes with CÃ¦sar's Picture; Now I perceive the errour of my Judgment; Why should we hate Countries that hurt not us? The Roman Yoke galls not our necks: you see Our old Lord, Prince of Verulam, dares own His Title: and what Curiosities Has our young Prince brought from the Nursery Of Arms and Arts, sweet Italy? Fro. Rare Musique; And Voices, such a Trebble and a Baseâ Tet. How merrily shall we liveâpox o' the devill. Pontia, CÃ¦sarina, and Brianella walk over the Stage. There's the confoundress of thy Master's musique, Pluto could not have rak'd him out of hell Such a Step-Mother, she reigns o're his Father. Fro. But the date of her Sovereign pow'r is out, By this time the old Prince is in our hands, We have him in the Woods. Tet. And long you'l keep him; His very first reflexion on the fury Or flattery of's Wife, posts him to Court, He'l leave you. Fro. 'Tis expected; therefore, Tetrick, My Master has sent me to ingage you, If th'old Prince change his mind, you can perswade him, He believes all you say. Tet. I believe nothing You say, or do; your Plot's a scurvy Plot. Fro. But you can mold it into a better form. Tet. Nay, since you can begin your plots without me, End e'm without me. Fro. And shall I return The Prince this answer? Tet. Every syllable. Fro. Shall I return his Princely Present too? Tet. That is to be consider'd ofâlet's see't. Fro. Alas, 'Tis only a poor Table-Book, The cover is but Gold and set with Rubies, Not worth your looking on Tet. This needed not; Without fee, I'd have been o'th' Prince's Counsel, And the Cause shall go with him, never fear 't; But they say, the Step-mother's inquiring For Witches, they'l discover all we do. Tro. That she may seek no further, I have told Her Favorite, my Mistriss Brianella, That yesternight there came into the Woods A Bard, that's a Witch-maker: Tet. Your Witch-maker By any means must be attended by A Conjurer and a Witch to learn their Trades. Fro. I'l be the Witch, I think my face will serve; Tet. And Schollars make rare Conjurers, I'l play my part, Come, bring me now to kisse your Masters hand. [Exeunt. Enter Pontia, CÃ¦sarina, and Brianella. Pontia. Stir CÃ¦sarina, only exercise, Can prevent th'undermining of thy Colour By the Green Sickness, that long gravel walk Did alwayes please thee. CÃ¦sarina. When I was in breath, But I'm grown too short-winded for a walk Of this length, Madam, I shall ne'r hold out. Pon. One quarter of an hour, and I'l release thee. [Exit CÃ¦sarina. But Brianella, art thou sure thou saw'st Filamor in the Arbor? Brianella. At his Lute; With him a Flamen, and a winged Boy That should be Cupid, perhaps Priest and God Will in some Dialogue present themselves To Princesse CÃ¦sarina; the Prince said, They should sing the Description of a Triumph. Pon. Then I shall now see whether Filamor Continue still his Love to CÃ¦sarina, And how she looks on him after his Travails; Lets to the close walk, my Son Adolph's there. [Exit Pon. and Bri. Filamor discover'd in an Arbor, with a Lute in his hand; on either side the Arbor, on two pedestals, Cupid stands, and the Flamen kneels: as CÃ¦sarina walks by they sing. Flamen. Why unarm'd, poor Cupid, pr'y thee, Tell a Mortal how tis with thee? Cupid. To one Mortal, what another Has committed, may be told; I am plunder'd, so's my Mother. Fla. What frail Man durst be so bold? Cup. No, to make us more inglorious, Tis a Woman that's Victorious. Fla. CÃ¦sarina? Cup. They (who saw her) Say, she rides in Triumph here, That my Mother's white Doves draw her In their Chariot. Fla. Look, she's there. Cup. How knowest thou? Fla. By a sure Token, Thy Torch quench'd, and thy Bow broken, Makes her Trophie; Captives follow. Cup. One Slave Sorrow's Livery wears, His Eyes sink, his Cheeks fall hollow, In his Face his fate appears. Fla. That Slaves Filamon; no Lover CÃ¦sarina triumphs over, Suffers in Love's Cause so sadly, Cupid help? Cup, I cannot do Him a favour; I would gladly: But I am her Captive too. Chorus. The World's grown so stupid That now 'tis in fashion To pray to God Cupid, If a Man have a passion, He that hopes for a Cure, Must get it of Beauty, Or else do his Duty. That's Dye, or Indure. Enter above Pontia, CÃ¦sarina, Adolph, Brianella. Adolph. Has Filamor been so long out of Britain, To forget CÃ¦sarina is your Daughter? Court her without your leave? Pon. Or thy consent. Ad. That's more then you know (by your favor, Madam) aside Pon. He kneels, see. Ad. Hear him. Fil. Heav'n is in your Eyes, Disorder not that beauty with a frown On your Adorer; if my love displease, Be not offended with my gratitude, I name you in my Hymnes, as shipwrack't men Sing to the Deities which have preserv'd them; By virtue of that sacred word, your Name, I have out-liv'd the pains of death in absence, At my return to you, dearer then life, Friends, Father, or our common Mother Britain; Will you, for want of one poor smile, destroy me? CÃ¦. Make not yourself a Supplicant to me, Prince Filamor, kneel where you owe a Duty; Kneel to the Gods, to grant you Understanding, That you may see, I cannot love; and then To one that can love you, apply your self; You have my counsel and resolve. Fil. For pity, Leave me not to despair; though all my sighs Breath'd on the aire of Italy, were lost At such a distance; now we'r met again; May not pray'rs alter your severity? CÃ¦. Can prayers alter a Decree of Fate? Fil. Pray'rs joyn'd with services: if Verulam Open too narrow a Prospect for your eye I'l draw my sword, and merit from my Country Th'inlargement of our bounds. Pon. He works upon The humours of Ambition; I'm afraid The Milk she suckt from my Breast will betray her. CÃ¦. To be the first on Mountains, in poor hovells, Rather then t'have the second place in Rome, Was CÃ¦sar's wish, but 'tis not CÃ¦sarina's; Your Cottages cannot make me a Court; I'm not like Ladies newly come to London, Who from the vast height of Diana's Temple Look down, and please their eyes with little people, Objects, that are not magnify'd, I scorn; The Prince that would discover his Dominions, Let him turn the Prospective Glass to me. At the right End, great Subjects I must see. Pon. She yields? Ad. For my friends sake, would she did yield. Fil. Great Subjects! all our British Lords shall kneel To CÃ¦sarina; I have form'd it thus, You know the Kentish-men have took up arms Against the Trinobants, the Londoners; Whilst Scots and Borderers, with their deadly feuds, Ingage the Northern parts in Civil Warr; No sooner from the Roman Slavery This Iland's free, but we (like mad-men arm'd) Die our white-feather'd shafts in our own blood; Against these Enemies to the Publick Peace I'l make a League, and fight my Country's battails, Till I fix Britain in a Settlement. Then, as the best means to keep Peace, (thus Purchas'd By me) I may with confidence presume, The Wisedome of the Nation for their King Will chuse their General; who shall lay down, At CÃ¦sarina's feet, his British Crown. CÃ¦. Filamor, you have had a pleasing Dream, And I was loath to wake you, till I found My self concern'd; Britain you may subdue, If you fight well: but for your fancy'd Conquest Of CÃ¦sarina, let me undeceive you: 'Tis true, I have declar'd for Sovereignty, The Title of a Queen I dote upon; But if you offer'd me a Crown, I should Refuse it as Gold poison'd by the giver. Pon. Fly Brianella, and relieve my daughter, She comes off bravely; tell her, I and Adolph Stay for her; bid one call my Generall. Exeunt Pon. Ad. and Bri. Fil. Will you not love? then I'l revenge your hatred. CÃ¦. Do, revenge. Fil. On my self, I feel my Spirits, Like those the Chymist is extracting, search Their brittle prison, with a hope to find Some Vent, and then to fly into the Wind. CÃ¦. In that point you may use your own discretion. Enter Brianella. Bri. Madam, your Mother's in the Sicamor-Walk. CÃ¦. I shall attend her. [Exit CÃ¦sarina. [Enter Fromund. Bri. I'l stay, and get newes [aside. Out of my Servant. He whispers Filamor. Fro. Tetrick waits you, Sir, With modells for a Mask, he has already Made your Witch-maker's Prophesie; I'l play A Witch, Tetrick will be a Conjurer, Bassus the Bard, and we'l shew your weak Father What a pernitious Wife he doates upon: [Exit Filamor. What ailes he now, that he has lost his tongue? Has not the Princess vex'd him? Bri. Yes indeed. Fro. And will not vou vex me so? Bri. No indeed, For, you love me, you say: Fro. I'l swear it, Madam. Bri. What will not men swear; but swear your heart out, You never shall swear me out of my Reason. Fro. Reason! I warrant, Tetrick reads to you The Mathematicks, you think nothing certain But Demonstration. Bri. Is Proof Demonstration? Nothing but Proof is certain. Fro. Kisse me then, And we will prove, that One and Two make Three. Bri. I will not two and three, pray leave your fooling. Fro. In serious earnest, I would marry you. Bri. Meaning my Fortune? Fro. Meaning Brianella; Without a Portion you'r a Fortune, Madam. Bri. Thou art a flatt'ring Knave, I doubt Fro. Resolve Your self, please to lay your Commands upon me. Bri. I've no Commands for you, but I've some Questions. Fro. Which if I answer notâ Bri. You'l hold your peace: How many Duells did you fight at Rome? Fro. But one. Bri. Answer me like a Gentleman, Was't for your Mistris? Fro. It concern'd You, Madam. Bri. How do you look when you lie? Fro. Not You alone, But joyn'd with all our noble British Beauties, Whose Honour a base Roman had traduc'd. Bri. You kill'd him? Fro. Your Cause slew him by my hand. Bri. Modestly spoke; Had you no hurt? Fro. He prickt An Artery, which pos'd th'Italian Surgeons. Bri. Since, you your self have study'd Surgery? Fro. Would all Gentlemen spent their time no worse; I have found out some Secrets. Bri. You've a Powder, VVhat do you call't? Fro. The Sympathetick Powder. Bri. Wil't cure the Tooth-ake? Fro. Presently; try, Madam. Bri. No, it may prove Love-Pouder, then 'twill cause The Heart-ake: in spight of my own and Love's teeth I'l keep my heart whole. Now to my last QuÃ¦re, What design has your Charge upon the Princess, I see in thy sweet looks, there is some plotting. Fro. Plotting of Masks. Bri. Plotting of Knavery! But I shall know't, my Lady will tell me, And she'l know't if there be a Witch in Britain. Fro. What is thy Lady going to the Devill? But let her go, for there's other way To sound the bottom of Prince Filamor, He's forty fathom deep below my plummit, She goes to a wisewoman? Bri. No, she means To go to a Wiseman, to the VVitch-maker, The Bard; who came last night into a Cave In our VVoods, you shall bring me to the Bard. Fro. Fie! the Bard sings only to Princes Ears, His Prentices, VVitches, and Conjurers Answer Great Ladies; I'l commend you to Th'old Witch that deals in Palmistry; but then I'l be your husband. Bri. VVho shall be my husband The VVitch must tell me. Fro. And that Witch I'l be. [Exit Fromund. Enter Pontia, Adolph and CÃ¦sarina. Pon. I live again, my Children are become Their Mother's Parents: when thou, my dear Adolph, Look'dst with the eyes of pious rage and scorn Upon the Sacriledg of Filamor, Who (without leave from me) durst court thy Sister, Then my Soul clos'd in your dead Father's Urne, Sprung from his ashes; but when CÃ¦sarina Stood the temptation of a Showre of Gold, Such as the Poets dream'd not of, a Crown Offer'd her by a Prince, wise, young and handsome; But yet my Enemy, then I felt the joys Of Immortality, to see my self Mother to a Beauty, born to revenge me Upon a Villain. Ad. Villain? then Fame isâ Pon. Filamor's Fool. Before he went to Rome, Filamor had the art of coz'ning Fame: For with a Rebels Impudence he mask't Foul Treasons under fair and specious Names: The disimpowering me to rule my Husband (An affront not to be forgiv'n) he call'd Friendship to Adolph, Love to CÃ¦sarina: He's now return'd improv'd in Villany, Therefore tis time he went a longer Voyage. Ad. And whether will you send him now? Pon. To Hell: Nor shall he go so far alone; his Father, Sylvanus. And his Sister Violinda Shall bear him Company; th'indignity, He would have put on me, shall ruine him And his whole Family; I did not think (When this Match with Sylvanus was first treated) Occasion durst be giv'n, but I resolv'd It should be taken; for I that was born A Prince, and no mean Beauty, certainly Would never have bury'd my self alive In the cold Grave of an Old Prince's Bed, But to rise up with his Crown on my head, The principality of Verulam, Which I am marry'd to, I'l joyn to that Of Malden, which is my Inheritance. CÃ¦. But Madam, is this Justice? Pon. Give me Pow'r, Let honest men, that go to Law, have Justice: Subjects may plead their Titles, Princes must Dispute what's Advantageous, not what's Just: A Crown he merits, who piles Tow'r on Tow'r To scale the Stars, and ristle Soveraign Pow'r: But he that puts himself into a fright With empty sounds, meer Terms of Wrong and Right. Is fitter (when his Conscience checks at them) To wear a Mitre then a Diadem. [Enter Crispus, Capito, Gracchus and Sergius. Bri. Madam, my Lord General, Pon. My Lord, Are not our Orders sent away to Malden, That I see your Lieutennant-General here? Crispus. Yesterday your Express came to his hand In Malden. Capito. Presently I hors'd the Foot, We march'd all night, and by the break of day I brought your Army into Barnet-Woods, Which is within a League of Verulam, Where safe and undiscover'd they are lodg'd Till my Lord General Crispus please to come. Pon. Capito, you've been active in my Service. Our thanks is but th'earnest of your reward, Ha! who are these? Cri. Two of my Life-Guard, Pon. Britans? Cri. No, Madam, Roman Gladiators, Sword-men, We call them Masters of Defence, Pon. Stout-men? Cap. Men that fear nothing, death's their play-fellow, They dye upon the Stage to please Spectators, Pon. But were these kind of men ever imploy'd In a great Action? Cri. In the Servile War; They brought it to a measuring cast at Rome, Which should Command in Chief the Lords or Slaves. Pon. I'l have 'em for my own Guard, tell 'em so; Cri. Gentlemen, tis the pleasure of my Prince, On the account of Valour and of Service, To intrust you with the Guard of her Person. Sergius. Tis a high honour; Gracchus, I had rather Be trusted with her Daughter, Gracchus. So had I: Pox, that a Swan's Nest, this poor Iland should Have more great Beauties then the severd World. Ser. That narrow Seas should breed such Venuses, Gra. That Brittish Whales should play, with such sweet Mermaids. Pon. We make short Meales, you may dine ere you go. Cri. Tis past Twelve, if by One we be a Horse-back, We shall return by Three to do your Work. Pon. Then you'l have time to hear what good success The Brittish Bard will promise, do you look Your General's Commission be drawn up For the Conquest of Verulam; come my Lord. [Exeunt Pon. Cri. Cap. Bri. Grac. and Ser. Adolph. and CÃ¦sarina. CÃ¦. My Mother us'd to give us better Precepts, Ad. She was good-natur'd, and had sense of Honour, CÃ¦. And of Religion; but now she leaves The Temples of the Gods, to consult Witches, As Brianella tells me; I suppose The General must go with her, she knows we Are for no such black Voyages, tis strange The General should, for he's a man of Honour. Ad. Was not our Mother once as strict as he In point of Honour, but she's chang'd; this comes Of Malice; Sister, take you heed of Malice, Outside and inside you'r my Mother's Picture, In hate to Filamor you resemble her. CÃ¦. I have th'ayr of her Face, not of her Vices; I love not Filamor, as you do, Brother, But would not be his murdress, like my Mother. Ad. You would not with a Dart or Poniard kill Prince Filamor, but with a Frown you will: It were an Honour by your Hand to dye, My Friend falls sadly, murder'd by your Eye. CÃ¦. Can he be murder'd, who has pow'r to live? Ad. He has no pow'r, but what you please to give: Lov'd Sister, save my dear Friend's life, and make The noblest person happy, for my sake. CÃ¦. Can you (who to a Brother's love pretend) Ruine your Sister to preserve your Friend? Ad. Ruine my Sister? CÃ¦. Free Love forc'd, destroys More then our Fortunes, or our Lives, our Joyes; I'l here no more on't. Ad. So, you'l part in anger, And take this fair occasion to break promise? CÃ¦. In what? Ad. Did not you promise me, to beg Princesse Violindas's Picture? CÃ¦. For my self? But you shall have it. Ad. Thou art my best Sister. CÃ¦. But if I get y' her Picture, you must do Something for me. Ad. Something, nay any thing; Still my best Sister. CÃ¦. But when I enjoyn you To take off him, for whom you thus torment me, [aside I shall be your worst Sister; for this Picture, You will do whatsoever I Command? Ad. Give me her Picture, and command my Life. CÃ¦. A Lover's life? what's that? some Authors say, You 've one to keep, and eight to give away: Muster your nine Lives, Brother, if you'l stand My Charge, for 'tis your Patience I'l Command. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Sylvanus, Filamor, and Violinda in the Woods. Syl. Blessing on Blessing fall upon my Son, Faster then tears fall from my Eyes for Joy To see thee in my Arms, I'l keep thee here, Thou shalt travail no more. Fil. Yes, if I say, That 'tis not fit your wife should govern you. Syl. Alas! I could not eat nor sleep in quiet, Till I had told her, that 'twas thy advice: Excuse the weakness of thy Father's age, I was not born a Cowr'd. Fil. Your Valour, Sir Is one of Brinains memorable Fortunes; For when Arcadius and Honorias lost Their Laurell to the Scots, then you defeated A Cohort of the Roman Horse of Malden. Syl. A man would think those Romans ran away VVith my commanding Pow'r, for, ever since I marry'd Pontia, I've serv'd under her, She shall obey me now. Fil. Spoke like a Prince That understands the duty of his Subjects. Syl. I'l have no Governessâbut if my wife Knew of our Meetingâ Fil. VVhat will your wife do? Syl. She'l take 't unkindly, and I would not grieve her, Because she Loves me; she'l not stay thus long From meâby this she's in my Bed-Chamber, And misses me. Fil. No, Sir, no Creature comes Into your Bed-Chamber, the doors are bolted, And your Physitians (fee'd by me) give out, You rested not last Night, and have took something To procure sleep. Syl. Then Filamor makes this A day of happiness to his old Father. Fil. Sir, you'l make this day happy to your Children, If you'l lay your Commands on Violinda To Love her Servant, my brave Friend, Prince Adolph; I am a Suitor for him. Syl. So am I, And two such Suitors must have no denial. Violinda. My Brother knows, Sir, that I love Prince Adolph, As much as he loves Filamor: Syl. Enough, 'Tis enough in all conscience, Violinda. Fil. In conscience: Violinda should love him As much as he loves her, he doats upon her. Syl. Then I would have thee doat upon him too. Vio. Adolph's my Brother's Friend, and CÃ¦sarina Is my Friend; Sir, for both I have a friendship: But that I should love CÃ¦sarina's Brother Unless she's loves my Brother, there's no reason. Syl. No reason, Girl, I am for thee again. Fil. Away, you triffler, you spin out the time, Knowing I must prepare for th'entertainment Of my Step-Mother. Syl. Comes she to the Wood, Fil. Presently. Syl. My wife shall not come to me, I'l go to her. Fil. She shall not see you here, Pray, stay, Sir. Syl. Cross me not; I vow I'l go. [Enter Tetrick like a Conjurer. Fil. I must call Tetrick to him: Come away My Father's leaving us. Tet. You never think Of me, but when you'r at a loss; I'l meddle With no blown business. Fil. Keep him in the Woods, And I will make thee Lord of the whole Forest, Tet. Excuse, Original Infirmity, My humour's peevish, Sir, but my hearts good; I'l stop your Father's hast: Sir, I must Charm you. Syl. A Conjurer? I will so devill thee, [he beats Tetrick. Tet. Hold, hold your hand Sir; I'm your Servant Tetrick. Syl. Alas poor Tetrick. Tet. I am justly punish'd For looking ugly. Syl. Follow me, thou know'st. My sweet wife loves me. Tet. That's the Question, Sir Be pleas'd to stay and you will hear't determin'd; Matter of Fact 's this, The Princess of Malden, Your wife, intended to have dealt with Witches For the bewitching you (some say) to death: Your Son diverts her with the artifice Of setting up (as she thinks) a Witchâmaker, Call'd (for the singing of's Predictions) The British Bard; as soon as she has din'd Your wife comes to the Bard's Cave, then you'l know Whether she loves or hates you. Syl. Son, I'l stay; But hide me from my wife. Fil. She shall not see you. [Exit Syl. and Fil. Tet. Fromund, I Conjure thee, appear O Witch. Enter Fromund like a Witch. All goes as well as heart can wish, th'old Prince Is now ingag'd. Fro. Yonder comes Brianella, My Mistress, with a Basket full of Plate, Her Lady's offering to the British Bard: You owe me thanks for 't, I hinted the Plate, We must help one another, Enter Brianella, and her Maid with a Basket. Tet. In requital I'l make teee tell her Fortune; speak out Sister, You do so mumble, what would y' have me do? Fro. Move the great Witch-maker, the British Bard, To inlarge my Commission with power Of Life and Death, over Plants, Beasts, and Men. Tet. What, what? Fro. Sooner or latter, I am sure, I must come to the Faggot and the Fire; Shall I be burn'd for nothing? Tet. One year more You must tell Fortunes by the Hand; next Spring: I'l move the Bard for you, pretty sweet Sister. Fro. In the mean time, if I might but bewitch Dumb Creatures, only Monkeys, Cats, and Dogs: A scurvy proud young Widow, yesternight, Call'd me old Beldam, let me but bewitch. Her little Dog; though she bears patiently The loss of a kind Husband, yet the death of Her little Dog (I'm sure) will break her heart. Tet. Teach me? I'l pull thy nose off, and that Dog Shall eat it: go, take from that noble Lady That Basket full of Plate, look in her hand And tell her Fortune. Enter Pontia, Crispus, Gracchus and Sergius. Fro. Your handâI'm prevented. Bri. But Mother, Mother, I hope we shall meet. Fro. At the Mark-Beech, an hour hence. Bri. I'l not fail. O Madam! they know all things; the Magician Could tell me, 'twas a Basket full of Plate. Pon. Ministers of Fate, I come to know the Issue Of a design of Blood. Tet. My Song will fit her [aside. Madam, we'r not impowr'd to answer Princes, That's reserv'd for the Bard himself, who now In the Bard's Cave is discovered a man with a grey beard, in a Russet Gown, sleeping with a Harp in his hand. Lyes in a Trance: I'l hold up to his Soul Your Princely Off'ring, with the names of those You vow to death, if you'l but write them down, 'Tis the Bard's Custome. Pon. Bring Pen, Ink and Paper. She writes, and gives the Paper to Tetrick. Tetrick reads the List. DIS MANIBUS. Pontia devotes to hell Filamor, Violinda and Sylvanus. Tet. So, I've her Treason, now, under her hand. Pon. You'l wake him? Tet. With our usual Ceremony Of Musique and a Dance. Tet. and From. hold up to the Bard the List and the Basket, to which Sergius points. Ser. Look you there Sirrha, Barbara de pictis veni Bascauda Britannis: That British Bascaud would sell well at Rome. Gracc. So would the pretty Maid that brought the Vascaud; But Princess CÃ¦sarina for my money. Musique. Tetrick and Fromund fall into a Dance, then comes in another Conjurer, and another Witch, and from under his Coat and her Gown, drop out two little Familiars, an he and a she. At the end of this Antique, the Bard wakes, and sings. The Bard's Song. On the Poplars and Oaks When the white Raven croaks, And the crafty young Fox withdrawes, With the fair Fawn Through a green Lawn Just into the Lion's pawes: Then the Scene of Blood is acted; Then the Wood-Nymphs run distracted; The Mandrake shrieks, The Moon's pale cheeks Look dark; But hark, Brasse Basons and Trumpets are sounding; See, see, how soon They thunder the Moon Out of the Eclipse she was drown'd in. What should we fear? The Sun shines clear; No Mist on the Hill, Not a Clowd in the Skie: The Lark sings shrill, And the Swallow flyes high. The Scene of the Bard is shut up, Manent Pontia, Crispus, Brianella, and the Gladiators. Enter Capito with the Commission. Cap. The Generall's Commission, under Seal. Pon. You'r now impowr'd to conquer Verulam; What do you think of the success presag'd? My Lord, what's your opinion of the Bard? Pontia gives the Commission to Crispus. Crispus, First, Madam, give me leave to hear your judgment. Pon. I take him to be somewhat more then humane; He speaks the Language of another World, So well; that his expressions are all Picture; The fair Fawn, the young Fox, and the white Raven Is clearly my old Husband and his Children; The Moon eclyps'd that's I, whose light is drown'd Till your victorious Drums and Trumpets sound: You have my sense, give me your own; I know Crispus to be a man of so much worth, He scorns to flatter any Prince; speak freely. Crisp. E're we end our discourse, I'le clear that point: She'l find I am no flatterer, I have watcht A long time for this opportunity, [aside. To set a Looking glass before her Soul: Then freely (since I have it in command) I think our Druids Prophets; but our Bards (Like all the tribe of Fortune-tellers) Juglers. Pon. Then you believe not this to be a Vision; What do you think it is? Crisp. Intelligence From his confederate Knaves; you are betray'd. Pon. And so, you would advise, not to proceed? Crisp. Madam, had I been of your Cabinet-Counsel, You should not have begun it. What's your quarrell? Th'Opinion, That Wives should not rule their Husbands, For these words spoken by a Child (for then Prince Filamor was not sixteen years old,) You'l ruine him, his Sister, and your Husband; Strange grounds for murdring Princes, and for Vesting All their Dominions in your self. Pon. Yet, Sir, Some Counsellors that are as wise as You, Have approv'd both the Grounds and the Design. Cris. If by wise, your Highness means Politique, I grant those Counsellors were more wise than I: For, my simplicity will never flatter My Prince into a Deity; I cannot Tell you, that Princes are exempted from The Law of Nations; that Revenge and Murder (Stains in the Meane) are Triumphs to the Great: I cannot find out Presidents for Injustice, Nor instance (as your Flatterers have done) That if particular Rights had been preserv'd, The World had been unconquer'd, Macedon One private Kingdom still, and Rome another. Pon. What are the Maxims upon which you build? Cris. My Principles are Honesty and Honour, Jewels of value in a poor man's hand, Inestimable in a Prince's Breast: How happy our Posterity will live Under a Prince character'd by a Druid Who prophecies that you little British Princes Shall kneel to one King, and describes him. Pon. How? May we hear the description? Crisp. I remember So much as shews the great disparity Between You and that Monarch: Thus 't begins, Now in Britain reigns a King, Young and active as the Spring; And pray observe it, Madam, thus it ends, He has Valour, such as might For the whole World safely fight: Wisdome, which could rule it too; But he's Just, and will not do For a thousand Worlds one Wrong: Never did his spirit long, On another Price's Prince's Throne (By meer Pow'r) to raise his own. And so far, for any ends, Is he from destroying Friends, That ev'n his Enemies confesse His Mercy to the Mercilesse. Make this Just King your Pattern. Pon. Sawcy fool; Deliver your Commission; we shall chuse A Generall, not a Tutor. She strikes the Commission out of his hand. Crisp. Humbly thus, My publique Person I put off, and pray, That, as a private man, I may be heard. He layes down his Commission at her feet. Pon. But not for your Commission; young man, You have a Successor: he's in my eye; Capito's our Generall. Cris. For him I move, (In reference to your safety) that you'l put him Into immediate Action, else you'r lost. For (if I understand the Bard) you lie Open to Filamor, your plot's betray'd, Your life at stake: the Question is not now, On what ill Grounds you have begun, but how (Being ingag'd) you may preserve your Self. That's a Just Cause, in which your nicest Subject May draw his Sword with honour. Pon. And who worthier, In a Just Cause, to be our Generall, Then noble Crispus? There, take your Commission. Cris. No, Madam; as the Romans manumit Their Slaves, you have freed Crispus with a blow; You struck me, as men strike their swounding friends, To bring me to my Senses: hitherto, Devotion to your service first, and then My own concern (both as to Fame, and Fortune) Gave me the trouble of distracted hopes: Now all the lines of my Ambition Meet in one little point (touchd by your hand,) I centre in my Self: fix'd to enjoy The pleasure of a private life; retirement From splendor, and from Care, which presses in To gilded Rooms; Porters at Prince's Gates Could never keep out Care and Fear, two strangers To low-rooft Houses, where I'l live and dye. Pon. Will Crispus do a Service to his Prince With such disservice, as to let me know My Cause is just, and make the World suspect it, By quitting the Imployment? Cris. Pardon me; Should the Gods send their winged Messenger With that Commission, and all their Hands to it, The Gods should pardon me. [He offers to go. Pon. Stay, if he goes, In my Attempt I can proceed no further; We may use valiant Rogues to do a Murder; [aside. But Polititians are concern'd to find Persons of Worth, when Conquests are design'd. Crispus, how high a value I have for thee, Let my great Heart demonstrate, which descends Below it self, to an acknowledgment That I have wrong'd theee. Cris. When I serve again, I'l take up your Commission. Pon. So obstinate? Then I stand up my self, your Prince, Accept it From my Command. Cris. You may command my Head, My Hand shall be my Subject. Pon. Yet hear Reason, Though you'l not hear your Prince; you censure me For seeking to destroy a Family For a Boy's words; yet for a Woman's words (And she your Sovegraign) you can dispense With Loyalty in your self, abandoning Your Prince to her awaken'd Enimies. Cris. Justly I am rebuk'd; upon my knee I beg your pardon, and accept your favour; Longer to hold you in discourse, were dangerous He takes up the Commission. To your Affairs; I take my humble leave: Now that your Sword is in my Hand again, It shall not freeze, I'l strike a suddain blow; Fortune's swift-turning Wheel deceives the slow. Exit Crispus. Pon. Capito, you perceive, that in our Army You hold the second Place, to have the first; At the next Vacancy Capi. Let me serve your Highness In any Place, 'tis to my hand alike, To bear a Truncheon or to trail a Pike. [Exit Capito. Bri. Other men are Flesh and Blood, the General, Fire; Here were a Husband now, if one could catch him: Old Witch, I'l venture at thy Lottery All my Gold, but I'l draw a General. Pon. The suddain blow tis I must strike, not Crispus; Before he comes, Filamor may be fled: Filamor's the Bard's Fox, Crispus my Lion, Valiant, but generous, I know he'l seize, But that's all, for he'l never kill the Prey, Nor can I, bare-fac'd, do 't; that Foxe's case Shall piece this Lion's skinâGo Brianella, Bid CÃ¦sarina meet me at the Poplars, I've new Instructions for her, she must smooth Her fore-head when she looks upon the Prince; Do you seek him out, and tell Filamor You'r not sent by my Daughter, (nor forbid) To let him know (after his Mask) if he Take her out, she'l dance with him. Bri. I'l acquaint him. Pon. The Gods are bound in Honour to perform What they have promis'd by the British Bard. Bri. My life upon 't. Pon. Filamor's life 's upon 't; And my Hand shall revenge his base affront. [Exeunt. Enter CÃ¦sarina and Violinda with Picture-Tablets in their hands. Viol. If with our Pictures we could change our selves, I would be you: Would you be Violinda? CÃ¦sarina. And never wish to be my self again; If I were Violinda, I'd not Change With CÃ¦sarina fot the World to boot: But Violinda were you CÃ¦sarina, You would not love your Brother Filamor. Vio. What would he care for my hate, when you lov'd him? CÃ¦. My love would hardly please him were we chang'd, For I should be his Sister, you his Mistress, And you would be no kinder then I am, But here's my Brother. [Enter Adolph. Vio. Then I take my leave. Adolph. Madam, you fly from me; as if our Hearts Mov'd upon Needles touch'd by th'opposite Poles, Of the Celestial Loadstone Love, yet may I mention it to you. Vio. From that I fly, And not from you; I've an Esteem for you, As Brother to my Friend; but till she love My Brother, when you mention love to me; I shall retire. [Exit Violinda. Ad. You see, how I'm concern'd To be my Friend's Sollicitor in his Suit. CÃ¦. Sollicit me for your Mistresse's Picture. Ad. Have you her Picture, that's some comfort yet, This Violinda and I will never part. CÃ¦. Hold, you'r not like to meet, but on Conditions. Ad. Have I not Sign'd a Blank? fill you it up With your own Articles. CÃ¦. First, you shall promise, Never more to move me for Filamor. Ad. You are not (sure you cannot be) in earnest? CÃ¦. No promise, Sir, no Picture. Ad. I am silenc'd, Let Filamor's own Merits speak for himâ Comeâ CÃ¦. Not so hasty: Secondlyâ Ad. Have you A pair of these Commands? CÃ¦. You shall ingage, To use your best endeavours to perswade Filamor to relinquish his pretence Of Love to me. Ad. And all this for a Picture? Would y' have me loose, like Ãsop's Dog, the substance With catching at the Shadow? You know, Sister, On Filamor's hope of you, depends my hope Of Violinda. CÃ¦. Let what will depend; These are your Termes. Ad. You think, I'l not accept them? Give me the Picture, I'l undo my self To be reveng'd on thee; such pow'rfull Reasons I'l give my Friend against theeâhe shall take up Thy scorn, and thou (as he does now) shalt sigh (When Filamor enjoyes a greater Beauty) And say, That matchless Prince was once my Servant. Enter Filamor talking with Brianella. CÃ¦. Well, I have all, I would have; here's the Picture, And there's your Man, look you to your Ingagement. She gives Adolph the Picture. [Exit CÃ¦sarina. Filamor, Dance with me? CÃ¦sarina dance with me? One name may sound, at distance, like another, Did she name me? Madam, excuse my doubts, I do believe you, yet so great an honour, To me so unexpected, on the suddain Puzzled my faith: I owe to Brianella For the first newes that makes me Fortunate. Bri. But, Sir, you must conceal th'Intelligence, Or else you'l lose your Spie. Fil. I'd rather lose Verulam. Bri. You'r not like to keep it long, [aside. But to tell that, is out of my Commission: I take my humble leave. [Exit Bri. Fil. Farewell sweet Maid. Compar'd to me, how happy art thou Adolph, When Violinda gives thee a denial, She grieves thee with so much Civility. Ad. Your Sister carries it the handsomer; Mine, like a Tigresse, shews an angry fore-head, Her fury lightens in her eyes: your Sider Poisons me, like a Polititian, smiling; Long since I'd burst, but for this Antidote Our Friendship, Filamor. [Embraces. Fil. Our Friendship, Adolph, Is a felicity which ballances All our misfortunes. Ad. Love it self gives place To Friendship in my Herauldry. Fil. Take heed How you set up Friendship against Love, Adolph, Love is a God. Ad. He is, and we are Men, Who importune the Gods, and give them trouble With Pray'rs and Sacrifices for our Loves; But what Wives they will prove, Heav'n only knows: We may pray for a curse, and some kind God May crosse us for a blessingâlet me tell you (As I do love you) truly, I suspect My Sister. Fil. Ha! Ad. Did I say, I suspect? Fil. That was a Princely check upon his tongue. Ad. I know, my Sister will be no good Wife. Fil. If any man, but Adolph, told me so, I should not be thus patient. Ad. In plain terms, I know, my Sister will be an ill Wife. Fil. Is't madnesse? or is't envy that asperses Thy Sister? Ad. Wherefore do you furle your brow? I tell you CÃ¦sarina is not worth A thought of Filamor's. Fil. Unsay thy words, Whilst we are friends. Ad. If you remember her, Let it be so as we remember Tyrants, For th'evill they have done. Fil. Be wise betimes, Kneel, and beg pardon of thy Sister's virtue: Yet we are friends. Ad. Therefore I am oblig'd To disabuse youâ Fil. Friendship, up to heaven, From whence thou cam'st; against this Enemy, The Common Enemy of Love and Virtue, I draw the Sword of Justice. [Fil. drawes. Ad. Hear me out, Ad. drawes. Before I set this Seal upon thy hearing; What Fury strikes out that clear light, thy Reason? Are you so blind, so obstinately blind, You will not see a dreadful Precipice, When I point to it? If you'l not believe Your Friend, you have before your eyes the sad Example of your Father, good old man! How like a child is he aw'd by my Mother! There's twenty thousand Mothers in my Sister; Already she begins her tyrannous reign, And makes you more a child than your weak Father, Or else you would have more Sence then to love One that scorns you. I've done. Fil. And I begin; First, let me joy my self, for cancelling The long misplac'd relation of a Friend To so unnatural a Brother; then, Thou stranger to my heart, in thy heart's blood I'l wash off the durt cast upon thy Sister. Not love her? Why? because she scorns me? fool, I would not love her if she did not scorn One of no merit. Ad. Then you do her wrong, To move my Sister for one of no merit. Fil. Unworthy man, that which thou would'st destroy, My Love to her, creates in me a Merit. Ad. Alas poor Filamor, to deceive thy self What curious Art thou hast, what subtile non-cense, A merit and no Merit? and for this, The fast and loose, the Juggle of a Word, Thou draw'st upon thy friend? Fil. Dear friend, forgive me, Something you said (which concern'd CÃ¦sarina) That put me into passion; what it was I have forgot, but as 'tis stated now, I must confesse, I blush to find my self In this offensive posture. Ad. Put not up Your sword; for you may fight, and you may chuse: Will you relinquish all pretence of love To CÃ¦sarina? Fil. Not whilst I've a sword, And strength to guide to thy heart. Ad. 'Tis well; I'm glad to hear that you are so resolved: You may fight; but, Filamor, if you do, You shall fight with my Sister. For this Picture, (A part of Filamor, and Adolph's All) I promis'd CÃ¦sarina, to perswade you (With my best oratory) to relinquish Your love to her; I have perform'd: and you, Before, like a rough Diamond, only rich In my belief, thus polish'd, strike ny eyes: Amaz'd to meet so glorious a surprize. Filamor's estimate is trebbled now In Adolph's valuation; and by this time (You have yet more advantage by your triall, For) CÃ¦sarina's heart (I warrant) akes For fear I should prevail. Fil. She meant (I hope I flatter not my self) to try, if she Might venture on me any further Grace Then th'honour she intends me at my Mask, To dance with me. Ad. That's some kindness yet; my Sister Has but one fault, she thinks Love is below her; But Friend if, from so high a pitch, her Pride Can stoop to any Husband, she's thy Bride. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Brianella at one Door: at another, Fromund like a Witch. Bri. This is th'appointed place; there's the Mark-Beech, And the old Witch too; luck an't be thy will: A General, I beseech thee, gracious Beldam; Mother, you are a Woman of your word. Fro. O my good Daughter, neither Man nor Woman Will break their word with you; show me your hand, Off with your Glove: Ay marry, Child, if CÃ¦sar Were now our Lord, he would send for his Guards That watch th'Arabian Trees, and set them Centree Upon this Balm. Bri. A Complemental Hag, [aside. How come you to be such a Courtier, Mother? Fro. I shall be catch'dâFirst, Daughter, I pray resolve me, Did never any Gentleman, at Court, Tell you your Fortune? Bri. Yes. Fro. Then if your Hand Can turn a Courtier to a Fortune-Teller; Why may't not make us Fortune-Tellers Courtiers? Bri. A pleasant Witch: what? Compasses? do you Mean to survey my Hand with your Glass-eyes? Come, on with them: First, how long shall I live? Fro. Here's a deep Life-line, without Cross or Break; Ten, twenty, thirty, you'l live, till you be Just a year older then am I, a hundred. Fromund with his Compasses measures her Vital Line. Bri. That's long enough; shall I be fortunate? Fro. I never saw such a prosperity-line Running quite through your Triangle; it cuts Your Table-line, and has the noblest Sister, You'l be Right Honourable. Bri. So, here's Fortune, And Honour; but what Pleasure? how many Husbands? Fro. To that what sayes the Mount of Mercury? Tis cross'd with one Line, you'l have but one Husband. Bri. How? but one Husband in a hundred years? O pittiful! Fro. But in the Mount of Venus Are Stars; in Sol and Jupiter a Zone; A Venus-Girle, you'l have store of Servants. Bri. Shall I keep Counsel? Fro. At foot of Jove's Mount, Your Capital line and your Vital line Meet in an acute Angle, which demonstrates, Your Head holds correspondence with your Heart: You'l not tell any Secrets of your own. Bri. No, if I do; like a poor Vestal-Nun That can't keep Counsel when she meets her Servant, Let me be bury'd alive; this one Husband Will be (I hope) a good one: pray, what manner Of Man? Fro. Black hair, not curl'd by Art, but Nature; Good hopefull Signs. Bri. Have I seen him? Fro. To day, He courted you for a Wife. Bri. Ha! that's Fromund? He has a voluble Tongue? Fro. The Gudgeon bites. [aside. A winning way (she's taken with my Courtship) [aside. The young man Complements better then th'old Witch. Bri. A Traveller? Fro. One who in Forreign parts Has noted Men and Manners; I'm cock-sure. [aside. Bri. A Courtier too? Fro. In some Place, or Imployment, About a Prince: she's mine, from all the World. [aside. Bri. Prince Filamor's Tutor, Fromund, out upon him A younger Brother. Fro. So, so, my Cake's dow, Fromund is about to discover himself. When I believ'd my self to be cock-sure, If I had flung off my disguise, how she Had laught at me? Brit. What? Mother, a la mort? Fro. Daughter, I am considering your Condition, Will you lead Apes in Hell. Bri. Yes, (Apes is something To trust to) rather then I'l marry Hopes: I am for Honour, and Estate in Hand, No promising Husband is for me; can you Change me this Courtier for a General? For Fromund I'l not give one farthing-token. Fro. He's much bound to you. [aside. Bri. Make it my Lord Crispus, You shall have the worth of a hundred pieces, This Saphyr-Ring. Fro. If you would give me London, I cannot find a General in your Hand. Bri. Adieu. Fro. But the young Conjurer makes Love to me, And I'l lay my Commands upon my Servant, To search the Stars for my Lord General. Bri. Take the Ring; Mother: when shall I hear of you? Fro. In th'Evening: mean time, if you could but get Your Lady to move my Lord Crispus for you. Bri. That I am sure she will. Fromund throwes off the Witches habit. Fro. Then I am sureâ [Exit Brianella. The Generall will not have thee, he's a person Of so much honour, that he'l never marry One, thy dishonourable Lady speaks for: [Enter Tetrick. There's life in't yet; Tetrick, I must have thee To help me in the businesse of my love. Tet. The devill's in't, when men make love their business; Thou a man? thou a horse: and would thou hadst (Besides thy amorous curvetting qualme) All the diseases of a horse: I help thee? Fro. Thee I have help'd, and may prove to thy purse More instrumentall yet. Tet. Why, look you, Fromund, How you misconstrue me: I'l serve your love, If you will love at seasonable times, But to stand fooling now, when Pontia, Th'Illustrious Traytresse, takes up Gladiators To murder our great Masterâhere he comes [Enter Sylvanu reading a Paper. Reading the bloody List she gave the Bard. Syl. Dis Manibus. Pontia devotes to hell Filamor, Violinda, and Sylvanusâ Am I here?

What news is that, Sir? Syl. frowns on Fromund. Syl. Sense, Sir; I speak sense. Tet. That we have heard oft. [Syl. smiles on Tetrick. Syl. But when, Tetrick? when? Before I marry'd Pontia; never since, Till now. Fro. And now you understand your danger? Prevent it in her ruine. Syl. You'r a fool; Shall I destroy my wife for her first fault? Tet. That were to imitate her cruelty. Syl. Thou'rt wise. Tet. If she commit another Treasonâ Syl. Then she shall die. Fro. But you'l forget your Promise, Be pleas'd to write it down. Syl. I'l set my hand To nothingâ Tet. That's unprincely: but 'tis just To write as she did, your Note for her Note. Syl. 'Tis just indeed, I'l underwrite her Paper. Tet.

Pontia, This Mask was made for you by Filamor, And therefore if he take you out to dance, Dance with him CÃ¦sarina, though you love not The Man, be civill to the Prince. CÃ¦sarina. I shall. Pon. After the Masque, whither will you two walk? CÃ¦. Through the Lawne. Pon. Just into the Lion's pawes; [aside. O excellent, incomparable Bard! Gracchus and Sergius, you know the Lawne? Serg. I do; That's the Place. Pon. I Pay well. Serg. Then hang well, If either he or I neglect your service. Grace. Our Roman Swords shall fall upon your Foes. Swifter then Arrowes from your British bowes. Pon. When the Masque's done, remember Brianella, Your part. Brianella. Your Message to the Prince shall be Deliver'd, as from Princess CÃ¦sarina. Pon. Filamor will believe thee, when he sees Thy first newes (of her dancing with him) true: Do't carefully, and I'l make thee my care, The Generall will not deny thy love VVhen I move for thee. Bri. You'r a royall Mistresse. CÃ¦. My Dear; what are these Maskers? [They sit. Vio. Ovid's Huntsmen: Their Forms (chang'd by his Gods) the God of Hunting, Apollo, has restor'd to PhaÃ«ton, Cephalus and ActÃ¦on. Pon. See, they come. Apollo's Mask.

Enter Fil. &amp; Adolph as Cephalus and ActÃ¦on. Never may they see Sport, who stay When Phaeton sayes, come, or Go: ActÃ¦. Shall we rouze the long-liv'd Hart? Phae. Ask the Youthfull God of Art, (Who restor'd us our Forms) Apollo, My Father promis'd he would follow: [Enter Apollo. See, the great Huntsman comes at last. Apol. Our morning-Rites in Delphos past; I came to London, where my Sister Dwells in her Temple; but I miss'd her: For (vex'd with things, which fools desir'd) She was into her Grove retir'd: Then swift as ever Lightning flew, I cut the Clowds, and sail'd to You. Phae. You'l hunt? Apol. We'l dance. Phae. No Ladies? Apo. Yes, Four of the Metamorphosis: In those three Poplars grow thy Sisters, That Laurell Cloisters my coy Mistris; We two will untransform them now. PhaÃ«. All-pow'rfull Father, shew me how. Apo. My sacred Tree, That Conquerors and PoÃ«ts browes Crown'st with thy immortall boughs, From thunder free, With Musique shaken, cleave asunder, Daph. Ay me! a suddain clap of thunder Could not strike Daphne's heart so dead, The Laurell opens, and in it appears Daphne. As does that Voice, from which I fled To this Tree, that (whea th'Earth deny'd me) Open'd, and shut again to hide me: False Laurell, wer't thou kind so long, At last to sell me for a Song? What hope that Strangers will be just, When our old Friends betray their trust? Cruell Apollo, dost thou give Life to a Maid who fears to live? Some gentler God take Daphne's part, And close my Tree, or break my Heart. Apo. Sweet Nymph, thy Panick Fear dismiss, Apollo will not force a kiss. Daph. Why then for Daphne do you call? Apo. This is the Huntsman's Festivall, We'l only dance together. Daph. Then Daphne may (With honour) say, Apollo's welcome hither. PhaÃ«.

On the Huntsman's Feast, Like Pris'ners releas'd, Let's dance and sing; Till the Birds admire, What new happy Quire Makes the Woods ring, And drawes the Sphears nigher. No Pleasure transcends The Meeting of Friends. They dance [Filamor Walks up to CÃ¦sarina. Fil. Not Filamor, but Cephalus begs the honour Of a Corant. CÃ¦sari. Cephalus' es Suit is granted. Pontia. Come my bold Sword-men, now you'l have imployment, [Exit Pontia, Serg. and Gracchus. Fil. May I presume to kiss the Princely hand To which I owe this honour. CÃ¦. Does my bounty Incourage begging? you shall be content VVith the next favour you receive from me. [Exit CÃ¦sarina and Brianella. Fil. So does the covetous Fav'rite lose his place, By offering to impose upon free Grace. Adolph. My Sister's too high-hearted to be govern'd; Proud Minds, like billowes in a storm, are toss'd At their own rate; but if you steer, y'are lost. Fil. What a dull fool was I to lose her thus? [Enter Brianella. I hope not; here comes one who can resolve me; Dear friend, leave me alone with my Good Angel. Adol. VVhat means he? is the Devil his Good Angel? My Mother's Messenger? I'l hear her newes. Adolph stands and listens. Fil. Now Brianella, speak; is't life, or death? Brianella. Life, life Sir, Princess CÃ¦sarina walks To gather Violets in the Lawne, from thence She strikes up to the Lime-tree Grove, come thither, But keep your masking habit on, she said, If so by chance you met her in that Grove, You might have better Audience as a Huntsman, Then ever yet she gave you as a Prince. Ad. How's that? my Mother has a Plot upon him This cannot be a Message from my Sister. Fil. This Embassage shall put about thy neck A string of Pearl. Bri. A string of hemp were fitter, [aside. I am sure I deserve't, If you knew all: Excuse me; if my Lady call, she may Suspect my absence. [Exit Brianella. Adolph. Filamor, no haste, You shall not go. Fil. Then you shall kill me, Adolph; For if I live, I'l go. Ad. You are not mad? Do you know, Who invites you? Brianella, My Mother's Confident, the Agent for Thy cruel Step-Mother, who seeks thy blood: Do you know, what she said? Is't probable, My Sister (who scorn'd th'offer of a Crown) VVill love a Masking Suit? Fil. Was't probable, Your Sister would have danc'd with me? yet she would; And Brianella prÃ¦acquainted me With her intention: no more words, I'l go. [Exit Filamor. Ad. A happy voyage; I'l be there before you: She told him, CÃ¦sarina's in the Lawne; If he go thither, 'tis upon the Bow; I know the String, the strait path to the Grove; And whosoever is to meet him there, Shall find me on the place, to answer for him. [Exit Adolph. Enter Pontia, Gracchus, and Sergius. Sergius. Our Trade is to kill men, we never yet Shed Woman's blood. Gracchus. But Madam, for your serviceâ Pontia. And my Reward: you shall be so rewarded, You'l wish I had more Princess Violinda's For you to kill. Grac. May we not have the honour Of murdering her brother? Pon. That's reserv'd For my hand; none shall revenge Pontia, But Pontia. Serg. If the Prince, your husband, wants An Officerâto cut his Throatâ Pon. For him, I'l provide meaner Instruments, there's Gold, Jewels too; You are Strangers, and the Natives (After this fact, if they can take you) will Tear you to pieces: To prevent your danger You see my Groom waits for you with good horses, Fly; though for me you have lost Italy, And must lose Britain; wheresoe're you land, You'l make your selves a Country with that Treasure; Romans farewell. Grac. Our saddest losse is, such A bounteous Mistresse. Serg. And it wounds us deeper Then we can wound the Princess, when our Swords Shall weep her blood. Pon. But Gentlemen, pray kill My Daughter-in-Law with as little fright To my own Daughter, as is possible: If you bind CÃ¦sarina, bind her gently. [Exit Pontia. Serg. As gently as these arms can bind a Lady; To kill her Step-Daughter, she gives me a stock, Will keep me like a man on any Ground; But before I leave Britain, I'l be bold To ravish her own Daughter; I have had A stomack to her long. Grac. Meat for your Master; Thou ravish her? I'l ravish her my self; Room for your betters, from the Gracchi I am Descended. Serg. No, degenerated, Raskal; When we play'd Prizes on the Stage at Rome, Then wert not thou my Mimick? did not I, With this short Faucheon, round about the Stage, Chase thee in that high crown'd Hat, with Gold-labells? Grac. And what did I, the while? Ser. Why, at my Head (Helmet and all, in which I wore this Fish) Thou flungst a Casting-Net, and crydst, fear nothing, I catch not you Sir, I catch but your Fish. [Gracchus draws. Grac. Upbraided with my Calling? Ganlick-Rogue, You Country-low, did not I hear thee Beg (Like a cow'd Slave) the People's suff'rages; To give thee leave to take up that white wand, The Rudies (which discharges Sword-Players, From fear of playing Prizes by Command) And wilt thou play a new Prize for a Princesse? Come on. Serg. Take notice of this Thumb reverst, The sign of death to Fencers. Grac. Hold, you puppy, Sergius draws, and bends his Thumb back. What? Roman against Roman? lets draw Cuts? Serg. Then I bend down my Thumb; live, to be hang'd: The long cut carries her. Grac. Fortune's a Slut, They draw cuts. To give the prop'rer man the shorter Cut: No remedy, I must content my self With Princess Violinda. Enter CÃ¦sarina and Violinda. Seg. Here she comes, The Fencers seize them. Princesses by your leave, I'm somewhat bold. Grac. And I am welcome. CÃ¦. Help ho! Vio. Murder, murder. Grac. No faith, tis but a Rape. CÃ¦. Unhand me, Rogue. Serg. Peace, you shrill Grashopper, Or I'l open your Heart to stop your mouth; Do y'see this triffle, this was Tarquin's Dagger, And knows the way to Rape. [Enter Filamor. Filamor. Prodigious Villain Look a man in the Face. Serg. That's not so pleasant As looking Babyes in a Ladye's Eyes: Help Gracchus. [Serg. falls. Grac. There's a poor Remembrance for you. Fil. Die like a Coward: he's dead out-right that stirs; Answer, what put into your hearts a hope Gracchus comes behind Filamor, and runs him in at the left arm: Filamor runs him into the Body: Gracchus falls, and mak'd a strange Grimas grinning like a dead man. To ravish Princesses? Serg. The Devil-Lust; There was a Devil (of their own Sex) in't, The Devil Pontiaâshe contracted for The Life of Violindaâ Fil. I have paid Your Wages, Slave. Serg. Justly, oh, I die justly. Sergius stretches out himself as dead. CÃ¦. How it afflicts me, that my cruel Mother Should be my dear Friend's mortal Enemy, And seek the Life I prize above my own? Your Brother bleeds much, Violinda; have you Nothing about you that will stop his Wound? Tear, tear my Handkercher! Pray, take it Sir, Lose not you self in the preserving me; You look pale. Fil. Madam, My Wound blushes for me, To hear your preservation ascrib'd To Filamor, 'twas Innocence preserv'd you, When betray'd by this habit. CÃ¦. By what Habit? Fil. By th'honour you intended me, if thus 'T had been my Fortune to have met you in The Lime-Tree Grove. CÃ¦. Who said so? Fil. Brianella. CÃ¦. She did abuse you. Vio. Has she not abus'd Your Brother too, and sent him to meet me Among the Lime-Trees? to that Grove he went, Just as we turn'd into the Lawne. Fil. Did Adolph? Excuse me, Madam, I must needs go see What becomes of my Friend. CÃ¦. Tis a Bow-shot To the place, if you go thus bleeding thither, You'l faint. Fil. I'l die, before I leave Prince Adolph To danger. [Exit Filamor. CÃ¦. Let us follow Filamor, I hear my Mother has a plot upon him. [Exeunt CÃ¦sarina and Violinda. [Gracchus gets up. Grac. 'Twas well for me that I was bred a Mimick, If I could not have made strange ugly Faces, And imitated the Grimas of Death, The very last grinn, I had never past For a dead man; Dead-man indeed, by'r leave, Your Gold and Jewels too fall to my share, By the right of Survivorship. Gracchus searches Sergius his Pocket. Serg. The right Sergius gets upon his Feet. Of a Fool's head: soft; Hands off, Goodman Gracchus, Or I'l so slice your Fingersâ Grac. What? another Dead man's Ape? nay, Sergius, if you out-do me At my own Weapon, I'l give thee the Bucklers: Hereafter we'l turn Tables (since thou art The better Zany,) thou shalt be my Mimick. Serg. Come, let's not fool away our Lives, and stay Untill the Hangman cure our wounds; our Horses Stand ready: Farewell Britain, where the Ladies Yield not to Romans. Grac. Where we have no luck In any thing; for as the Mastives fly on's, So do the Men, and they both fright like Lions. [Exeunt. Enter Adolph. Adolph. Sure all but I forget this Lune-tree Grove; Here's neither Filamor, nor CÃ¦sarina, Nor any of my Mother's blood-hounds; ha! My nose bleeds, and these drops some hold to be Ominous Effects, when they've a natural Cause, The fear that hants a Lover till he sees His absent Mistress safe: but Violinda Thou art not altogether absent from me, For hereâhere sits thy Proxy, in my bosome I wear thy painted Representative In Gold, too poor a Temple for my Goddesse. Enter Pontia with a Poniard in her hand. Pontia. The strong imagination Filamor has That CÃ¦sarina is to meet him here, And something in my face resembling her, Will passe me, and my Poniard. Ad. Fair'st of Pictures, [Adolph opens his buttons. Come forth, thou dear Companion to my heart. Pon. Fall right; go now, and counsel thy old Father Not to be rul'd by's Wife. As she stabbs Adolph, enter Filamor staggering, CÃ¦sarina, Violinda, and Servants. Filamor. I come too late To save my friend, but not to perish with him. Adolph. My Mother? [Adolph looks up. Pon. My Son Adolph? Violinda. Adolph's kill'd. Pontia flyes away, Filamor falls at the feet of Adolph. Ad. No, noble Violinda, Adolph lives. CÃ¦. Filamor's dead. Ad. Yes, cruel CÃ¦sarina, But he might have surviv'd this fatal hour, Had'st thou been kind. CÃ¦. Had I been fortunate, But I was Mistress neither of my Love, Nor Fortune: the Gods govern'd that and me. Ad. Pray let me weep Filamor's Obsequies, He was my Friend. He puts by his Sister. Vio. He was my dearest Brother. Ad. He was, thou best of Sisters; and methinks There should be virtue in thy lips to kiss him Alive again: but if he liv'd, thy kisse Would kill him, cruell, cruell CÃ¦sarina, Thou hast no title to him. CÃ¦. More then you, He was my honour's and my life's preserver. Ad. And would you not, if he could live now, love So brave a man? CÃ¦. They who dispose our Wills, Left it not in my pow'r to grant him love. Ad. A Surgeon! call a Surgeon for the Prince! [Enter Fromund. Here comes one that has skill inn Surgery, Good Fromund, search your noble Master's wound. No hope? Fro. No fear; 'twas but the losse of blood That made him swoond, he lives, carry him to rest. O Sir, your Mother's giving up the ghost, I left her Women chasing her. Vio. I'm sure She deserves death for murdring of her Son: Good Fromund search Prince Adolph, for he has A wound at heart. Ad. But Violinda gave it; Come CÃ¦sarina, if our Mother were Worse then she is, yet she's our Mother still, Not to be cast away for want of help, When we see how 'tis with her, I'l be dress'd For this slight hurt, a scratch upon my breast: But Violinda shoots into my heart A poison'd arrow, past the Surgeon's Art.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Sylvanus, Tetrick, and Fromund. Syl. Filamor slightly hurt, and did he swound? What riddle's this? Fromund. 'Tis easily unriddled; After the Villain hurt him, when he knew That Princess CÃ¦sarina never wish'd To meet him like a Huntsman in the Grove, As Brianella told Prince Filamor, Hearing that Adolph (who believ'd her Message An Artifice us'd by his bloody Mother) In the same Habit was upon the Place: The wounded Prince (never considering Himself, but fearing danger to his friend) From the Lawne walk'd up to the Grove so fast, That th'agitation of his Mind and Body Caus'd such effusion of his Blood and Spirits, As made him (when he came to embrace Adolph) Fall in a swound at's feet: I stanch'd the blood, And Sir, immediately your Son recover'd. Syl. My Wife's recover'd too? Tetrick. Her Mask goes on, In which you are to represent your name-sake, The God Sylvanus: 'tis time you were dress'd, They'r ready to begin. Syl. Her Mask? does she Triumph in Princes blood? Fro. Perhaps she hopes The pleasure of a Mask will make the Prince Forget her malice, and her Servants say, That when the Mask's done, she'l divulge a Secret In which you are concern'd. Syl. How is't with Adolph? Did not my Wife take him for Filamor, And strike at her Son's heart? Fromund. But miss'd her aime Miraculously; for Prince Adolph had Princess Violinda's Picture, which he wore In a Gold Tablet next his heart, he was About to look on't; opening of his buttons And stooping, comes your wife, who being deceiv'd By's Huntsman's Suit (so like Prince Filamor's) Stabb'd at his heart, but light upon the Gold And did not pierce it, only her Poniard glanc'd Upon his breast, and drew some crimson drops: Straight he look'd up; but when she saw her hand Imbru'd in her son's blood, she fled and fell Dead (as we thought); but she deceiv'd us all. Tet. Will you please to put on the Wood-God's shape; You'l be too late, what do you study on? Syl. Why should the Gods reprieve that guilty woman? Fro. The Gods themselves had not been innocent, If they had let her die a natural death, And scape the hand of Justice. Tet. Sir, the Mask? Syl. I'l have no Mask, till Pontia's in her Grave; Arrest her, Fromund, and when she's condemn'd See Execution done, be sure my wife Revive no more. Fro. Fear no Recovery, My life for her death: she's a Venimons Creature; But if she were a Viper, let me get Her Head and Body parted once, I'l watch 'em For ever meeting. Syl. In her List for Hell, When Pontia writ my Name, I bound my self To punish her with death for her next Treason. Tet. Sir, your best time will be when her Mask's done, Or else the Secret she means then to publish Will die with her. Syl. God of the Woods, Sylvanus, Whose shape I now assume, do thou inspire me. [Exeunt. Enter Pontia wearing Diana's Cressent on her head. Pon. If the Celestial minds had been possess'd With such a bloody rage as fill'd my Breast, My House had been destroy'd for my Offence: But the Gods spar'd my Children's Innocence; And when my Soul was frighted with her Crime, Bound for Eternity, they gave me Time For the recovery of Life, and Fame (Dearer then Life) that my corrupted Name Might be with tears purifi'd, and made fit To grace my Tomb, when my Inscription's writ. Enter CÃ¦sarina. CÃ¦. Madam? Pon. I sent for you, to let you know The Gladiators were not slain; my Servant Tells me, they fled to Barnet-Woods: I've sent To have them apprehended, and they shall Be brought to Justice; now let's mind our Sport, Which must disguise my trouble, that I may [aside. Give Filamor an opportunity: Diana's Cressent to a nobler end Was never worn; Goddesse of Chastity Assist the God of Love, shout from thy Bow His Arrow into CÃ¦sarina's Heart. Dear CÃ¦sarina, you are dress'd, stay here And thank Prince Filamor. CÃ¦. I shall obey you; But Madam, I beseech you, why am I Enjoyn'd to give him thanks? do you suspect, That I'm inclining to ingratitude? Pon. No: But your Gratitude at this time, may Dispose him to forgive my Cruelty, Which strikes into my Heart the very Poniard I aym'd at his. CÃ¦. This you'd have him believe? Pon. That Question makes me fear, that you your self Believe not my Repentance; 'tis no more Then I am to expect from all the World. But ere the Hour-glass, that's now turn'd, runs out, I hope to satisfie that general Doubt. Enter Filamor. He's here, the God of Marriage bless their Meeting. [Exit Pon. Fil. What Nymph's this? tis not CÃ¦sarina, sure, Though it presents her divine form? 'tis she. CÃ¦. Filamor! Fil. Heark, she calls me Filamor! But am I Filamor? do I see and hear? Nay, do I live? has not the Villain slain me? And is not that bless'd Form, inherent in My Soul, descended with it to the Shades? CÃ¦. No, Filamor lives, a Sacrifice of Thanks For the Pantheon in which all the Gods Are worship'd, whose united Pow'rs preserv'd Your Valour, that redeem'd my Life and Honour, An Obligation (past acknowledgment). For which I wish you all you can desireâ Fil, How I am ravish'd with Celestial Musique. CÃ¦. My self excepted. Fil. Oh, that Clause has spoil'd The fairest Evidence that was ever drawn For the intitling of a Lover's Faith To his sweet Hope. CÃ¦. Valiant Prince Filamor, Cast away that effeminate vain Hope, And think of noble Objects, Spoils and Triumphs. Fil. Great Actions, Madam, are for happy men, But misery designs my Arms to Rust, My Glory to the Urne that holds my Dust: I see, you do not love me, CÃ¦. More Sir, more Then you do love your self; for if I might Dispose of your Successes, Filamor Should, like young Alexander, conquer all [Enter Adolph. The World, but CÃ¦sarina; there's your Friend; Now Company comes in, I take leave of you. [Exitura. Fil. And I must bid adieu to Happiness. CÃ¦. Yet this my brave Preserver may believe, If I'd subject my self to any man, Filamor should be Lord of CÃ¦sarina. [Exit CÃ¦sarina. Ad. And so thou shalt, I'l pass my word; and then You may be the Insurer of my Mistress: For as the great Ship towes the little Cock-boat, My Sister towes thy Sister after her. Fil. You'r mighty pleasant. Ad. Which presages well, Now sit, and let's see, if Diana's Mask [Enter Tetrick and Fromund Be no worse than Apollo's; What sayes th'Authour? Tet. That the Mask isâbeginning. Ad. Then lie down. Musique. Diana's Mask. The Scene a Hawthorn Tree. Enter Pontia, as Diana; CÃ¦sarina as Flora; Brianella as Progne. Pontia. Goddess of Flowr's, though you have still Narcissus in your Daffadil, I fear you'l lose him by degrees; My Brother dis-inchants the Trees; Birds I restore; some other Powers May un-metamorphose Flowers. CÃ¦rina. Diana, the fair Huntresses, knowes She may my Flowr's and Me dispose. Pon. Come hither Flora, do you know This blushing Lady? CÃ¦. No, yes, no. Pon. You have forgot her; so had I: When, lo, I saw a Swallow fly O're London, to my Temple-top, Then to the grornd she seems to drop. But in her fall spreading her wings, Flyes to my Altar, sits and sings; Her voice I know, and that she mourn'd For her lost Form, which I return'd; The Swallow's Progne once agen: Brianel. And shall be happy Progne, when My Sister Philomel I see; I hear her in that Hawthorn-tree: Diana, pitty her sweet sorrow. Pon. My Grove, thy Nightingale I'l borrow, The Nightingale sings in a Hawthorn Bush. She shall be now Diana's Creature, I'l joyn her Honour to her Feature. A Maid the second time I'l make her; Back back my Moons, and overtake her An hour before that sad dishonour Thy husband (Progne) forc'd upon her. Bri. He was a Villain; yet that shape Might tempt a God to act a Rape. Violinda, as Philomel, appears in the Hawthorn, &amp; sings. Philomel's Song. Violinda. How my Rape was brought about, And how my Tongue cut out, I need not tell, 'Tis known as well As my woful name of Philomel, Which, though my speech did fail, My Soul did so bewail, That it throbb'd into a Nightingale. Then I, poor Bird, Had Tongue, but not a Word; I sung, but could not speak: As if my heart would break Warbled I. But no more Revenge I cry, Now the Ravisher's acquitted; For, Diana's mighty pow'r Calls back this the happy'st Hour, The Hour before the Crime committed. As Philomel comes down from the Hawthorn Tree, a Satyr leaps out of a Bush, and catches the hem of her Vest. Satyr. Twice a Maid And both times betray'd: Your Virginity's private Grant Must be sung With your new tongue, To inveigle a young Gallant? Philo. What art thou? Sat. A lustfull Satyr. Phil. Out, foul Goat. Sat. I can assure you, Goats are ravishers by Nature; But I love, let that secure you. Phil. What dost thou love? Sat. To dance, that's Sweet. Phil. Satyr, our Inclinations meet; Let's dance. Sat. No; I'm too much below you, My antique tricks I dare not show you, Diana so affects Sobriety, Th'old Wood-God dances with her Deity; For you three God Sylvanus brings Gods of the Copses, Groves and Springs; Enter Sylvanus, as the God Sylvanus, after him 3. other Wood-Gods. But though you are above my levell, Yet through a Bush I'l see you revell. Chorus. The Wood puts down The Field and the Town: Men labour there, As Ants toil here; But we still please our fancies: Nature sets us no task, Our whole Life's a Mask Compos'd of Songs and Dances. [The four Gods dance with the four Ladies. Syl. The Satyr acts the Roman [To Tetrick. Tet. Yes, I made [aside. Princess Violinda Philomel, to mind Th'old Prince of's wife's barbarity to's daughter. Bri. By the Princessse The Company's desir'd to stay, and hear What she'l discover for the Publick Good. Syl. The Publick Good? Fro. Perhaps she may build Temples, Now that she's in the habit of a Goddesse. Tet. When she does any Good, Publick or Private, Let none think that I'm vers'd in both the Globes, If th'Earth does not rise up, or the Skie fall. Pon. Justice and Truth compel me to reveal A secret, which Discretion would conceal: But I'l reveal it to no private Ear; All are concen'd, and therefore all shall hear. If any think it stange, that I express My serious thoughts in such a fained Dress, Know, since by his sad fate your Prince was curs't To marry me, this Habit is the first In which I've done no mischief; Treason stains My Princely Robes: and if my Hand retains The native whiteness, tis not that I'm Good, But that I could not take the dye of Blood. So foul as I never had Woman been, Had but my Pow'r been equal to my Spleen: My Husband's life I did to Hell devote, Malice, which Hell it self would not promote; But the just wrath of Heav'n turn'd my Design Laid against him and his, on me and mine; To murder Violinda, Rogues I hir'd, To ravish CÃ¦sarina they Conspir'd; And when I thought a Dagger to have stuck In Filamor, at Adolph's Heart I struck. Who would be wicked? when the very Crime Conceiv'd, torments our Souls, and at the time When 'tis deliver'd, like an Engin broke, Destroys us with the force of our own stroke. Forgive me all that bear a Prince's Name, The glorious Title which sets off my shame; And you, dear Pledges of my Lord's first Bed, With mercy look upon the tears I shed; Now that you see my traitorous Offence Wash'd in these streams of Publick Penitence; In one Orb let us near Relations move, Forget my Hatred, and embrace my Love. [She rises up. Syl. The Devil, out of all his Languages, Could not pick words more moving. Tet. Yet they work not, The Prince sits still. Syl. Though she stands up to Court him. Tet. If any man believes the secret of The Princess's Repentance, let him speak. Syl. Their very silence has pronounc'd her door. Pon. The hope of comfort adds but to my grief, For I see, all I say finds no belief; But when in Charge against my self I bring Facts out of which your fears and dangers spring; You'l answer, what security affords, The soft contexture of a few good words; I grant, they rather may your Fears increase, And therefore I'l give Hostages of Peace: My Adolph bound in Love's eternal Bands, I'l render into Violinda's Hands; And Filamor (by sacred Hymen's leave) Shall CÃ¦sarina from my hand receive. [Pontia rises, and goes to joyn their hands. Come CÃ¦sarina, give the Prince your self. CÃ¦sarina. From me what is not due to Filamor, Who, with his life in's hand, rescu'd my Honour? Adolph. Did not I prophesy? dear Filamor? CÃ¦. The Prince, in lieu of his, may claim my Life, But not my Slavery; I'l be no man's Wife. Violinda. She speaks my resolution. Filamor. Do y' hear Adolph? Now who's the Prophet? Ad. Thou artâthe blind Prophet; I am the Seer; they are ours as sure As we are theirsâ Pon. I'l try another Speechâ Sylvanus sits down in the Chair of State. Ha! who presumes to take my place? what's he? Tet. A Judge, bound by his oath, when he hears Treason Confess'd, to doom the Parricide to death. Pon. No Judge shall doom me, but the Prince my Husband. Sylvanus discovers himself. Syl. Behold the Husband to whom you appeal, A Judge, bound by the honour of my word, When you first sought my life, that if you ever Committed a new Treason, you should die: There needs no form of Law, from your own mouth A clowd of Witnesses have prov'd your Treason; Nor will we torture you with hearing it Repeated, nor with your accursed blood Will we prophane Diana's sacred Grove. Be it decreed, That in the Lawne, the place Where by thy Gladiators Violinda Should have been murder'd, thou shalt lose thy head. A guard: away with her, but give her time (So it exceed not half an hour) to pray. Pon. Vengeance is slow, but certain. I have vext This World too long, dispatch me to the next. Fil. Doubt nothing Adolph, I'l secure her life: Tetrick, you have too far ingag'd my Father, 'Twas never my intention, she should die. Tet. 'Tis your own business, you may do't your way And save her life, that she may ruine you. Fil. Nay I would have her out of hope to live, That she may really repent, but then Dear Tetrick (thou command'st the Guards) reprieve her: Do't at my perill. Tet. I am like to do it At my own peril too; but I'l obey you. Fil. Come friend, and as we go, tell CÃ¦sarina [To Adolph How careful I am to preserve your Mother. [Exeunt all but Fromund and Brianella. Fro. What a strange Monster your great Mistress is, That neither her son nor her daughter open Their lipps for her? Bri. But do you think she'l die? Fro. Unless she has, like Nile, more Heads then one, One head's condemn'd, I'l see't cut off, your servant. Bri. But heark you Fromund; I took you to be An honest man. Fro. Do y' find the contrary? Bri. Troth, 'tis no sign of exc'lent honesty To profess love to me, and in a time Of danger leave me to my Fortune. Fro. Why? Are you in any danger? Bri. Then you know not I was my Lady's Coy-duck, to bring in Prince Filamor? Fro. Pish! a poor little Treason, They'l never mind you, now they've got the Princess. Bri. This all the care you take for her that loves you? Fro. I understand not loving; will you marry? Bri. Who? Fro. Me. Bri: Do you call marrying, loving? Fro. Yes. Bri. Then I will love you. Fro. Then I'l secure you. But will you not break promise when you'r safe? Bri. No, I hate baseness; I have lov'd you long, But I'm so bashful, I should scarce have own'd it, If this unlucky occasion had not offer'd It self. Fro. Well, Madam, I have caught you now. Bri. I hope you'l keep me Fro. Safeâ [Enter Tetrick running. Tet. Undone, undone! Fro. Who's undone? Tet. Every good man, you'r undone. Bri. Must I be hang'd? Tet. No (drown you) you'l scape th'halter, That falls to our shares; but no matter what Becomes of us: Sylvanusâ Fro. What of him? Tet. Lost! all's lost, Pontia rescu'd, we are now Her Slaves. Fro. How's this possible? Tet. Hear, and wonder: We came into the Lawne; and though 'twas meant Pontia should live, she knew't not, but compos'd Her self to die, so mildly, that it struck Into astonishment all the beholders; Such a dead stilnesse was upon the place, 'Twas like a Sea becalm'd; when, in an instant, The Storm breaks forth, thund'ring came Pontia's Horse, And in the head of them her Gen'rall Crispus: Our Guards (amaz'd before) now as if they Had seen in th'Enemies shields the Gorgon's head (Which had the petrifying quality) Turn'd Statues; stood still, whilst the Maldeners Bound them; and Crispus, like young Perseus, Releas'd the condemn'd Princesse, seiz'd the Prince And Principality of Verulam: They took me Pris'ner, but the General (When he was told my Name, remembering He had read my Book of Fortification) Freed me. Fro. Then we may live to free our Masters; Nay, we may speak Treason before this Lady; She has promis'd me marriage. Bri. Since when, pray? I'l be judg'd by this learned Gentleman; You said, that marrying was loving; I Answer'd, that I would love you; but I hope I did not say, that I would marry you: Alas, poor Fool; O brave, brave General! Fro. The General's the Man, and I'm the Fool; [aside. You will not have me? Bri. First, I'l see you hang'd. Fro. But though in point of Love you have deceived me, Upon th'account of Gratitude; I hope You'l beg my life? Bri. That's all you have to beg, Y' have neither Lands nor Goods; but I'm too rich. To be a Beggar upon any score. Fro. To save your Life, I would have ventur'd mine. Bri. But your simplicity's no rule for me; In sober sadness, I will never marry You, nor espouse your Danger: So adieu, Kind younger Brother, do what you were born to; Shift for your self: O brave, brave General! Tet. Come Fromund, follow me, I know the Woods, I'l lead thee to a place of sweet recesse, Where we'l enjoy our selves, and never think Of Women more. Bri. But rise up Bard and Driud: [Exeunt Tetrick and Fro. Farewel Philosophers, and welcome General. Enter Pontia, Crispus, and Souldiers. Pontia. Command in our Name, upon pain of death, That none presume to pillage, or take Pris'ner Any of my Subjects of Verulam, Unless that Subject desperately rebel, And put his Country in Blood. Brianella. O Heav'n! And have I liv'd to see my Princely Mistresse Soveraign of Verulam? Pon. My Soveraignty And Life I owe to my Lord General. Bri. What Virgin would not love so brave a man? Madam, Remember now your gracious Promise, And move the General for me. Pon. Your best time Will be when business of the War is over; For, Marriages are businesses of Peace. Bri. O Madam, when your Highness was concern'd, I put not you off to a better time. Pon. If you'l not take advise, then take your Fortune; My Lord, you know this Lady? Crispus. Brianella. Pon. You know her quality? Cris. That she's the richest In all your Principality of Malden; In all your Court of Verulam the greatest, For she's your Fav'rite. Pon. She would be your wife; I have ingag'd to use my pow'r with youâ Cris. Not to make her my wife? y'are not in earnest? Pon. In earnest. Bri. So am I. Cris. And so am I, Never to marry a Property. Bri. Property? Cris. A Property for Murder, was not she Us'd for the intrapping of Prince Filamor? Madam, to me you made another Promise, By which you are oblig'd to banish her. Pon. My word's past, so's her greatness: Brianella, If to our Court thou com'st after this day, Thou dy'st. Bri. But I may see your Husband dye Before I go; then, I hope, you'l perform Your other Promise to the General; For, it seems, you have promis'd him your self; Give you Joyâof my Curses, I've one day [aside. Yet left to curse you; hang me, if I pray. [Exit Brian. Pon. My Fav'rite's banish'd; now Sir do you think That I'l perform my Promise? Cris. If you were A real Convert, of your own accord You would have banish'd all such Instruments, Pon. I have been so long wicked, that no man Will credit my Repentance, but distrust From Crispus wounds me. Cris. Why then (I beseech you) Do y' keep your Husband and his Children Pris'ners? Pon. Why are you so presumptious as to ask? Who made you our Examiner? your duty Is to attend, till we declare our self. Enter Brianella and a Footman. Bri. Bid the Groom bring my Horses to the Gate. Pon. Stay, Brianella. Bri. Sure, you'l let me go. Pon. Believe't I'l sooner part with my new Conquest; After you were commanded to withdraw, My Promise being debated, 'twas resolv'd Upon the Question, that you should be still My Favorite. Cris. Great hope of her amendment. [aside. Pon. Sir, you shall now have proof of our Repentance, Call in the Pris'ners. [Exit Crispus. Bri. To restore me to Your favour, was the General consenting? Pon. He hates thee, as I hate him, mortally. Bri. Shall he live? Pon. Poorly; thou shalt see him crush'd To his first Nothing. Bri. Mighty General, 'Twill elevate my Soul to see thy Fall: There is a Pleasure in Revenge, above The expectation or the joyes of Love. And to revenge my selve on thee, is just; But the betraying of Prince Filamor, [aside. Who never injur'd me, was base: Some power That, as I do, pities that noble Prince, Put it into her Heart, to spare his life One hour, and I'l make use of her new Favour To expiate my Crime; I'l now Charm Her, And free him from his cruel Step-Mother. Enter Adolph, CÃ¦sarina, Crispus, Sylvanus, Filamor, Violinda and the Guard. Pontia sits. Pon. Old man, who hast outliv'd Humanity, From me what can'st expect? Syl. What thou deserv'st, Death: death, to which my Justice sentenc'd thee, I do expect now from thy Cruelty; And I'l meet th'Axe with such a Resolution As shall (if thou dar'st be a looker on) Shake thy weak Soul into another Swound. Though I liv'd under thy Reign like a Waman, Yet I'l die like a Man. Pon. Since you'r so brave, I'l not take pattern by your former baseness; For, Sir, when I was to have lost my head, No state was thought upon, no Princes order'd To follow me; You shall have Filamor And Violinda to bear up your train. Between your Sentence and my Execution, Your wither'd narrow heart could afford me But half an hour; I'l give you a whole hour. Syl. Bountiful wife, you are extream obliging. Bri. My Pray'r is heard, I'l now serve Filamor. [aside. Vio. Filamor, what is Death? Fil. Better than Life, 'Tis Nature's greater bounty, for we may Improve it to an immortality Of Fame, by dying nobly. Vio. I have liv'd By CÃ¦sarina's rule, by yours I'l dye. CÃ¦. Oh, name not dying; though my Mother has Condemn'd you, yet Heav'n cannot be so cruell. Pon. Capito take you charge of the old man, And my Lord Gen'rall to your Custody, We do commit his Children. [Exit Pon. Capito, and Sylvanus. Cris. Here's Reward For all my Services, I am preferr'd To th'Office of a Marshall. Ad. May we two With your permission, my Lord Generall, Speak with your Pris'ners? Cris. At your pleasure, Sir: For, as to that, I am not limited, And I'l put no Restraint upon my self. CÃ¦. You ever were a Person of great honour. Cris. Therefore in this base Charge my Shame's the more; To serve my Prince I never blush'd before. [Exeunt.</field>

For taking of the Pris'ners from the Generall, That Letter to Prince Adolph I procur'd, Which shews there is a justice in my nature, I hope 'twill save the life of Filamor Whom I wrong'd: and I'm sure 'twill take away The last remainder of his Trust from Crispus, Enter Capito.

Madam, my Will is vassal to your Pleasure, You are my Gen'rall, not to be ask'd, Why, But What you please; and that I'l do, or die. Pon. First, show to Crispus your Commission, And vacate his: then take you charge of th'Army, Which we design'd you two hours since, when he Gave rules to us, but I was forc'd to use him, Till to this height he rais'd my Soveraignty. Now Verulam is ours, the Building's finish'd, And we'l take down the Scaffolds. Bri. Such a fall [aside. May all the proud Men have, who scorn kind Women. Pon.

No; we two must attend The Princess, after we have view'd the Army. Cris. My Lord, I'l wait on you, as cheerfully As ever I charg'd with you. Bri. Go thy way In quiet; though I long, I have no power To insult o're thee, thou'rt so brave a man: [Exit Capito, Crispus, and Souldiers. But to my business: humbly at your feet, [She kneels. Prince Filamor, I beg your pardon, for The impudent abuse I put on You To please my Mistresse: but to make my self Capable of your mercy, I've us'd all My interest with her to get that Letter Which trusts you and your Sister to your Friend; Your Mother thought it dangerous, but my power With her, prevail'd against her Reason. Fil. Rise, For what your Prince commands, you may be excus'd, I'm satisfy'd. Ad. So am not I, to see My Mother's favour thus misplac'd on thee: Out of my sight; were not Women, like Priests, Exempted from the power of the sword, I would have ki'lld thee. Bri. It had been but Justice, I do deserve to die, and I deserve not To be believ'd. Ad. Come Princes, I'l not trust you Out of my hands till I have lodg'd you safe. Bri. Then you must see them out of Verulam Within this half hour. [Exit Brianella. Ad. This goes to my Mother; [To Filamor. But my Friend and my Love shall go with me. CÃ¦. We'l all be pris'ners, or we'l all be free. [Exeunt. In the Bards Cave, Enter Tetrick as the Conjurer; and Fromund with the Bard's Beard in his hand. Tetrick. Once more I'm the mock Conjurer, the Gods Or else the devill take her that's the cause on't! Another Devil take mock-Prophecies, They prove so true: when I made the Bard's Song, Who would have thought those canting words should prove An Oracle? Fromund. I'l be the Bard to purpose; For, Tetrick, in these Fortune-telling Shapes, As mighty Pontta's Prophets we shall passe The regiment drawn up to guard the Scaffold. Tet. Then if the Generall scape my dagger, he Shall have Prince Adolph's luck, but Crispus is not So well bred as to wear a Lady's Picture Next to his heart. Fro. Strike home I'l second thee; By my hand the Lievteant-Generall fal's: Prince Adolph may then be the Generall, And he'l protect the Princes: what becomes Of thee and me, no matter. Tet. As I live, [Enter Brianella. Thy Mistris, coming hither, do thou slip Behind these Bushes; as I promis'd thee, I'l dispatch thy love business, if w'have time. [Exit Fromund. Brianella. Within there? Tet. Who's without there? Bri. Brinella. Tet. Go see the Princes die. Bri. No, they'r safe in Prince Adolph's hands, that one good deed I've done. Tet. Then to the Bard's Cave you are kindly welcome; (Now I may fool a little) what's your pleasure? [aside. Bri. Is the good Woman here, she that tells fortunes? Tet. You mean my pretty Mistris, the old Witch; She's riding on her distaff into Lapland, (To morrow being our Wedding-day) to fetch Her Gemmes, and all her Parafarnalia: Before she set forth, she commanded me, I should examine all the Stars that shin'd At your Nativity, for a Generall To be your husband: take't upon my word, The Planets know not any Generall That loves you. Bri. I hate Generalls, can you tell My husband's name? Tet. Ill news I'l tell you, Madam; My reverend Spouse went away in a whirlwind; Poor heart, the saddest soul; you'l hardly guess What griev'd her, the losse of your Saphyr-Ring, For which I set a figure, and t'appears Your Ring was lost by a strange providence, For he that finds it is to be your Husband. Bri. What if I like him not? Tet. You'l only be Torn in a hundred pieces. Bri. If he be Of the malignant party, or a rebell, You shall tear me into a thousand pieces Before I marry him. Tet. The man that found it (For now 'tis found) is of the Loyal Party. Enter Fromund. Fromund. Madam, I think, you dropt this Saphyr-ring? I saw you passe, and strove to over-take you: You were too nimble for me; but I kiss'd The ground you trod upon, and there lay this. Bri. 'Twas mine, 'tis yours, keep't, I'l take nothing from you Which Fortune gives you. Tet. Though it be her self; And (as the mouth of fortune) I pronounce, 'Tis so; come, let me joyn your hands in Marriage: Now you are Man and Wife; I leave the rest For night, if we out-live this day, that looks So black on Verulam, and our great Masters. Bri. Who's the Magician's Master, pray? Fro. Sylvanus. Bri. But the Magician is Pontia's Creature. Tet. Your humble Servant, Madam; do you know me? [Tetrick discovers himself. Bri. Tetrick the Conjurer? Tet. Fromund was th'old Witch. Fro. Yes faith, I was th'old Witch, an't please you Daughter. Bri. Oh you'r rare Fortune-telling youths! but we Are soon perswaded to a thing we like: For if I had not lov'd youâ Fro. And I you; I would not have marry'd another Lady. Bri. Nor would I've had another younger brother. Tet. On, on; the Princes have imployment for us? Fro. And We have Lives for them. Bri. I'l be your guide. Enter Adolph, Filamor, CÃ¦sarina, Violinda, and a Footman. Adolph. Our horses are now come, I'l be your Convoy. Filamor. You shall not give your self that dangerous trouble. Ad. I'l see you safe, out of my Mother's power. Fil. Then you must see us die, for that determines Your Mother's pow'r. Ad. Why do you make a halt? What do you mean? Fil. I mean to go on further; Filamor is now at his Journey's end, Here I'l lay down the burden of my life, And rest. Ad. Defend me! this is such a Madness, That 'tis infectious, it distracts me too; Will you stay, till your last hour be run out? Will you be accessary (not alone To your own death, but) to the murder of Your Father, and your Sister? Fil. Should I scape By a base flight, my Father's age would fall At Pontia's feet a bleeding Sacrifice: Forgive me, Sister; for thy tender Youth My heart bleeds through my eyes. [Filamor weeps. Vio. Do not afflict Your self for me; the World is full of Ladies, And I shall not be miss'd in that great Crowd: But howsoever, when you go to find Another World, I would not stay behind. Ad. Do y' pitty her sweet youth? and are y'unmov'd With her mind's bravery? how easily Will you leave us? [he takes CÃ¦sarina by the hand. Fil. As the soul leaves the body; Forc'd to it by fatall necessity: For a memorial of my love, I make you My Heirs, between you divide Verulam. Ad. Let a Sea-breach (to quench thy Funeral Fire) Swallow up Verulam, and Malden first: But whence comes this fatall necessity? You think to fly, is base? who ever stood More upon honour then th'old Romans? yet, After his Cimbrian Triumph, Marius fled And begg'd near conquer'd Carthage; you shall live Like a Prince still. Fil. I must not live at all; And better die by the hand of Injustice, Then by my own hand: in a word, I'm barr'd From my love, and I'l not accept my life. Ad. Do y'hear this, CÃ¦sarina? now you know, Your resolution is the cause of his; He will not live, because you will not love him: Though Filamor might live long, if my Sister Were not more barbarous to him than my Mother: For she's his enemy, death from her must be Expected: You, his friend, may get him off, And yet you leave him to his enemy's mercy. CÃ¦. Farwell, brave Filamor; a point is started Which makes me take my leave. Vio. You shall not go; Though for my own life I was not concern'd, Yet, CÃ¦sarina, for my brother's safety I must petition you. CÃ¦. Move not a Suit, I cannot grant. Vio. Can you not grant one Suit, To save two Lives? Ad. Nay Sister, you may go: But yet, remember, he, you leave to die, Rescu'd your honour. CÃ¦. 'Tis impossible, I can preserve his life without destroying My own contentment; therefore, Filamor, Your interest has the preference, I am yours. Fil. I am I know not what, my Joy's so vast, It puts an Army's strength into my nerves. To horse, to horse, I'l bear this Prize away Through Groves of Pikes. Ad. Stay, stay till I be ready; I'l not fight, till Violinda gives the word: Madam, you know, I had your gracious promise, When she was his Wife, that you would be mine? Vio. Well Adolph, by her copy I'm your wife: But Sir, if she had not been forc'd to render, I would have held out, till I had been older And wiser, for I understand not Love. Ad. Dear Madam, I'l instruct youânow let's chargeâ Enter Tetrick, Fromund, and Brianella. Tetrick. Your Mistresses; this Coupling-time's the death Of more Wild-fowl then all the Year besides; Look, here's another pair, of Widgeons, catch'd, And I am in the Net for company: Th'Army has hedg'dâabout the Grove, one Passe Is only open, at which we came in. Fil. No matter; Hannibal wrought through the Rock. Ad. Our Swords are sharper then his Vinegar. Tet. Yet, my young Hannibals, pray, view your danger? Fil. That's requisite; come dear. Ad. Come, [He offers to kiss Violinda. Vio. What would you do? Ad. I'd only kiss my heart into more courage. Vio. Speak softly, Sir, for fear your Mother hear you, And then, you will be chid abominably. [Exeunt. Enter Pontia, Capito, Crispus, and Officers of the Army. Pontia. Crispus, you see, your Greatness, like our Coin, Ev'n when 'twas Yours was Ours; wee've call'd it in As a base Mettal, that dishonours us. Crispus. I'm what you please, but onlyâ Pon. No Proviso's. Yet will you own the Justice of my Cause, And act in the reducing of the Pris'ners, And th'Army for their Generall shall own you? Cris. First, do like Xerxes, cut me into halves: Then lay me, where the moving Army may March through their Generall. Pon. Make him close Pris'ner. Capito. Take Crispus to your Custody, admit None to speak with him. Pon. Yet your Emissaries Exit Crispus guarded. May be deceiv'd. Capi. One in a tree (close by them) Saw them joyn hands. Pon. It seems they'r marry'd then, Yet since Adolph's ingag'd, I'd have them taken Without a drop of blood. Capi. That cannot be, Unless we send out more Spyes to discover, Before the Princes come to fight, what place They leave the Ladies in: If they be taken, Adolph and Filamor will lay down their arms, As I shall work it. Pon. Go, dispatch your Spyes. [Exeunt. Enter Filamor, CÃ¦sarina, Adolph, Violinda, Fromund, Brianella, and Tetrick. Tetrick. None believes my Predictions but your Mother; You'r in a Pound now, get out as you may. Filamor. The Passe, at which you came, is slightest guarded, Let's break out there. Adolph. Where shall the Ladies be? Fro. In the Bard's Cave, for there they will be safe. Tet. Your Mother has a reverence for the place, She'l violate a Temple e're she'l take e'm Out of that Cave. Fil. The Counsell is not ill; To the Bard's Cave we'l wait upon our Loves, If we break through, we'l send for you at night: But if the Army comes in to Prince Adolph, We'l see you presently. Ad. And if we fall, (Nay, weep not, Dear) we will have company Into the Stars, if the rogues go not downward. Vio. 'Tis only Multitudes that I'm afraid of. CÃ¦. When Filamor fights, I can fear no odds, His Cause is Honour's, Love's, and all the Gods. [Exeunt. Enter Pontia, Capito, and Souldiers. Pontia. Your Spyes are not come in? Capito. They've had no time For a discovery yet: do y'know these, Madam? Capito pulls out a Letter, and two Purses. Pon. The Jewells which I gave the Gladiators. Cap. One would think, you sprung from that fortunate King, Whose Jewells, lost at Sea, came to his Table Serv'd up i'th belly of a Fish. Pon. Where are The Villains? Capi. This account the Letter gives: Barnet-Woods were laid for them; by your Order: Our Souldiers follow'd, and came up so close; The rogues, for their last refuge, were constrain'd To imitate Merchants in a storm, who save Themselves, by casting over-board their Treasure: So, emptying into their hands these purses, They sow'd th'unplough'd Earth with your Gold and Jewells; And whil'st our covetous men gather'd them up, The Gladiators fled; and here's your Own. Pon. And they have their reward, a fearful Judgment; Their Lives are sav'd, but their Livelihood's lost, And that's more horrid then the death they fear'd; For in this Isle they dare not stay, nor dare they Go to the Continent, lest their Countrymen (Who command there) should hang them; they must starve. [Enter a Spie, and whispers Capito. You look as if we had our wish, what news? Cap. How infinitely fortunate are you, The Ladies in the Bard's Cave are secur'd. Pon. For Us, not for Themselves. Capi. My men have orders; The Princesses shall be brought in, to face The Princes, there they come; I will amuze them Till the work's done. Pon. They shall not see me yet. [Pontia goes aside. Enter Filamor, Adolph, Tetrick and Fromund, with their Swords drawn. Capi. Princes, what means this fury, that you brave With a few hands the strength of a whole Army? Pray, tell me, what do you rely upon, Your selves? or others? do y' look for Assistance? It must come down from heav'n, and there dwells none That will assist a Son against a Mother: Nor will heav'n own a Cause it has deserted? He points to Filamor. With Adolph Nature's angry, and the Gods With Filamor: If to your selves you trust, Reason will tell you, four before four thousand Must fall to th'Earth's cold arms, from whence they sprung: So that you only can expect to have From Heav'n a Thunderbolt, from th'Earth a Grave. Fil. Our Answer's in our hands. Capi. Hold Filamor, If you have no compassion for your self, Capito gives the sign to the Centree, and then Sylvanus is brought in by an Executioner. Look on the snow that lyes upon that head, Which must be taken off, at the first blow You strike. Syl. Filamor, if thou pitty'st me, Strike quickly, and let me die, any death, So I may be rid of my wife, I care not. Capi. Poor Prince, the Grief to see his Son so wilful, Distracts him. Syl. If he will not hold his prating, Cut his throat, Filamor; charge them, that my Soul May have her liberty, a thousand blessings Upon the hand, that fighting moves this Engine To strike my head off and divorce me from My brutish wife. Fil. We shall obey you, Sir. As the Princes are coming on, the Princesses are discovered under a Guard in the, Bard's Cave. Capi. Hold, once more; Princes take heed what y do How showes this Object? Fil. CÃ¦sarina taken? Pontia shewes her self. Pontia. Yes, Filamor; she that was once my child, Is now my pris'ner: when she marry'd thee, I disclaim'd her: I look upon her now As on a Rebell, yet her life I'l pardon, If you lay down your Arms. Fil. Immediately, A Roman would not pause in such a Case. He turns his Sword on his own Breast. Pon. If you but offer at your life, she dyes. Ad. Friend, there's no struggling against Fate, give me Thy Sword; There Capito, with my own I render Prince Filamor's Arms, he shall not kill himself, Let's Enemy do that office, I'l wait on him. Pon. So, now I'm all that I can wish to be; O 'tis the Queen of all Felicities To have full pow'r to reward and revenge. Bring the late General Crispus, that I may At one time cut off all my Enemies. Crispus guarded. First, Filamor, to youâI give my Daughter; To your Sister my Son, and to my Son I give my Principality of Malden, For I'l depend only upon my husband: For whose pardon and love thus low I beg. Syl. Rely on me, and you'l be a good Wife, Then I shall study to forget your Evill, And love you for your Goodness. Fil. With my thanks For this inestimable Guift, I crave Your pardon for my incredulity When you return'd to Virtue. Pon. That distrust Was universall, for which all have suffer'd; And yet thus far I would not have pursued Th'advantage fortune put into my hands, But that I knew nothing could bring my Daughter To Love's obedience, but the hope to save His life who sav'd her honour: To give her That opportunity, I committed you Both Pris'ners to your Friend. CÃ¦. I am bound to you For my conversion to Love's Deity. Pon. Adolph, for thee I have a second Guift, But greater then the first; into thy service And (nearer yet) into thy bosome take This man of honour, thoroughly I've try'd him, She presents Crispus to Adolph. He's perfect, use him, and he'l make thee Great. Let him be Captain Generall of thy Army, And give the Second Place to Capito, Whose strict Obedience and prudent Conduct, Makes him inferiour to none but Crispus. Cris. Now Pontia, like the Planet of the Night, Breaks from her clowd, and shews us her pure light. Cap. Though one Prince limits my Obedience, Two Sovereigns my bosome does contain, For in my heart Adolph and Pontia reign. Ad. Me and my love you've crown'd, and added these Two rich Crown-jewels. Vio. I'm oblig'd to you He embraces Crispus and Capito. Both for my interest in the Crown and Prince. Pon. Fromund, I joy you; and I'l move my husband To add a Title of Honour to your Fortune. Fro. Your Servant, Madam. Bri. Well, you are a Witch, You told me, I should be Right Honourable. Pon. Tetrick, to make you a Fortune, take this gold And Jewells. Tet: Nay, since Fortune smiles upon me, I'l not be testy now: I humbly thank you. Pon. Let us all thank Providence, that directs Bad Causes to produce such good Effects. [Exeunt.</field>

The Ancient Britains I have pleas'd; and now I come to their Descendents, to know how You'l censure me; my Doom I fain would hear, Yet, like you Lovers, what I hope, I fear.
