      <field name="fulltext">PROMETHEUS; OR, THE MAN ON THE ROCK A New and Original Extravaganza.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First performed at the New Royalty Theatre, (under the management of Miss Fanny Reeves), on Saturday, December 23rd, 1865, the New and Original Extravaganza, entitled PROMETHEUS; OR, THE MAN ON THE ROCK. The Music arranged by Mr. Herman. Ballet arranged by Mr. Marshall. New Scenery by Mr. H. Cuthbert. The New Costumes by Mr. May. Machinery by Mr. Smith and Assistants. The whole produced under the direction of Mr. Mowbray.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGUMENT. Prometheus, the son of Iapetus, and of the race of the Titans, the Marochetti of his age, who always had a cast in his eye, employed himself in the task of modelling humanity with the object of opposing the New Royalty of Jove who had usurped Saturn's dominions. To give life to his models, he conceived the daring design of stealing fire from the sun. For this act, Jove in a pique chained him to a crag of Caucasus, and to punish him more effectually sent him a model woman, and with her a closed box as a dowry. Prometheus, who, as he always had his clay about him smoked the trickâwould have baffled Jove's design, had not his mother, in a fit of fatal curiosity, opened the box and let out all those evils which have since infested the world. The spirit of Hope, however, lurked at the bottom of the box, and on her intercession, Prometheus was released on parole for the future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Characters. JOVE (a Usurperâfounder of the New Royaltyâconsidered as erratically erotic, but under the the rule of his Queen Juno) Mr. Connell. APOLLO (a great anomalyâbeing in the same capacity both Father and Sunâwho suffered because he allowed his PhÃ¦ton to drive his carriage) Miss Lydia Maitland. MARS (God of WarâVenus's suitor, and very well he seems to suit her) Mr. Fred. Hughes. MERCURY (the Lackey of the Gods, and Call-boy of Olympus) Miss Annie Bourke.

MINERVA (a strict Lady, on whose character there was no stain, it was so staid) Mr. Baildon. DIANA (the inconstant Moonâquite as useful as hornimental) Miss Atterwell. OUTIS (Prometheus's Mother, not mentioned in Mythology, but who it is reasonable to suppose did existâthe Author while he points out the Missis misses no point in supplying information to the Audience) Mr. Bentley. PANDORA (the great Unknownâa Model Woman!) Miss Brown. THE FATES, THE FURIES, AND SMALLER DIVINITIES Messrs. and Mesdms. Clotho, Atropos. &amp;c. THE SUN HEAD (a great Luminary) Mr. Hollingsworth.

      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. âThe Clouds (1st grooves). Lively music. Enter Mercury, R. Merc. So far so good. Yours, toujours to command. I'm Mercury be pleased to understand; The wily god who every sense deceives, Patron of playwrights, authors, and of thieves. On secret service sent to-day. Look out, And you'll soon find out what it's all about. Enter Apollo, L. How now, Apollo? whither wander you? We haven't seen your face this week or two. Apollo. I'm on my usual circuit, which I keep, Unvarying whilst other people sleep. I am an early riser! Merc. Where's your car? Apollo. Oh, I'm still waiting for the Morning Star. (crossing to R.) Aurora drives the first stage. Well, but you, Thus far beneath the clouds, what do you do? Merc. I'm on an errand here. Apollo. From Jove? Merc. Just so. Apollo. Then I can guess; 'tis to our friend below, Prometheus. Enter a Winged Boy, R., with a paper for Apollo, which he gives, and exits, R. Merc. Yes; but pray don't call him âfriend.â We don't know where his insolence will end. Apollo. Why, what's his last offence which makes Jove fear, And sends you down? Merc. We've not the least idea. But long we've watched him with some blocks of clay, Industriously working night and day. Apollo. For what? Merc. Why, that's the point we wish to know. We can't make out what makes him labour so. All night he toils, or if he rests awhile, His face is lit up with a mocking smile; And then he starts and wakes, and smiling still, Turns out, and turns to labour with a will. Apollo. 'Tis strange! This work of his you may depend, 'Gainst Jove does some conspiracy portend. Merc. (crossing to R.) And so I'm off to sift the matter out. Apollo. You'll find the task a hard one, I've no doubt. But I'll not keep you, for I'm anxious too. I think I'll call on him this morning. Merc. (red fire is seen at R. 1 E.) Do! Apollo. (crossing to R.) Ha! there's Aurora taking off the traces; So I'll decamp, just like de Camptown races. Duo.âApollo and Mercury.âAir, âThe Campbells are coming.â Merc. A truce to your punning, oh, ho, ho, ho! 'Tis no time for funningâ Oh no! oh no! Apollo. So, off I'll be runnin', With all his fine cunnin', He'll not take the sun inâ Oh no! no go! (repeat ensemble, dance, and exeunt, R)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. âRoom in Prometheus' House (2nd grooves); small table, with drinking flask, bowl, and spoon on it, C.; four children as clay models, on pedestals, crossing stage at back. Outis discovered dusting imagesâcoloured fires ready to light on pedestals, upon which the children are standing. Outis. Disgusting trade! Where is this whim to stop? If matters go on thus I'll shut up shop; My health is failing 'neath each new disaster, I'm thin as lath from dabbling in this plaster. I don't know how it is, but since this week, My son's gone crazyâmad upon a freak, For manufacturing a new humanityâ A most decided proof of his insanity! Each day, each night, beholds him at his toil, Soiling his fingers in the thankless soil; And all to fashion such like useless clods, Defective types of very soâso gods. (drinks) Very dry work. (rap outside) Hark! isn't that a rap? Perhaps the beerâI thought I heard a tap. Not so. (takes bottle from table) Well, here's the real Lethe tipple, Jove's own brew, not designed for common pipple. It's very odd! The more I take to drink, The more I find it difficult to think. I've nectar ta'en enough to clear my head, And yet I seem to get confused instead. Song.âAir, âBilly Barlow.â Now, it's odd, though I've taken of tumblers so few, When I look at one object, I seem to see two, And drink as I may, it's a sorrow to know, As the objects increase, so my wits seem to go. Oh! dear, how happens it so? It's a question of science I'd much like to know. Now, censorious folks might be likely to think, That, from present appearance, I'm given to drink; But should any accuse me, I'd have 'em to know, I consider intemperance not âcomme il faut.â Oh! dear, certainly noâ Drink was given for use, not abuse, here below. (noise outside, L. 1 E.) Ha! there's Prometheus! 'tis my sonâat last. Still on his modelsâin his eyes a cast; With haggard cheek, rough locks, and downcast head, And light in handâhe's never been to bed. Piano, tremolo Music.âEnter Prometheus, L. 1 E., with lighted candleâwalking slowly, as if in thoughtâwhen near C. of stage speaks. Prometh. To be or not to be! That is the question! (Outis blows out candle, and Music stops) I beg your pardon! What was your suggestion? Outis. Breakfast! Prometh. Away! (crosses, R.) I need no paltry food! Outis. Oh! do, Prometheusâit'll do you good. Prometh. Don't talk to me of food, prosaic griffin! (goes up and puts candle on table) Outis. I mention breakfast, and he's got a tiff in. Prometh. Repulsive beingâthere, take your food away! Outis. Don't let there be a food between us, pray! Prometh. (down, L.) I'll do'tâI'll do'tâI'll beard this upstart, Joveâ His wildest flights I'll dare to soar above! Outis. That's a sore subjectâyou are much too flighty! Prometh. Now, listen, motherâI don't wish to fright ye, But no more on that subjectâI command it! You sneerâbecause you do not understand it. Outis. But, son! Prometh. Away! (crosses, R.) You mar my best reflection! Outis. I mar? Prometh. Yes, maâso, go! Outis. I've no objection. There's lots to do, I'm sure, about the house. Prometh. Get out! Outis. Well! don't be so cantankerous. Prometh. Woman, away! Outis. I'm going, can't you see; But, mindâ Prometh. Adopt invisibility! Duet.âOffenbach. Outis. Why can't you take things somewhat easy, Copying your mother's unassuming ways? Whose constant thought is still to please ye, Love disinterested and above all praise! You, instead, I'm grieved to sayâmodel, model, &amp;c. You, instead, I'm grieved to sayâmodel, model! Model, modelâall the day! Prometh. Pray, mother, ceaseâit's most distressing Thus to interrupted be, and bored beside; Take my advice, without more pressing, Let a very gentle hint your actions guide. Though it's not polite to sayâtoddle, toddle, &amp;c. Though it's not polite to sayâtoddle, toddle! Toddle, toddleâright away! Repeat ensembleâOutis dances off, L. 1 E. Prometh. Now, as a fact not generally known, Permit me to observe thatâI'm alone. That being the case, it won't cause much surprise, If I'm expected to soliloquizeâ My speculation! Ah! how well it speeds, As day goes on, and as the night succeeds. Last eve I laboured, thirst and hunger scorning, And finished fifty models ere the morningâ Gigantic scheme! sublime! but where's the odds, If I can't animate these lifeless clods? Worse than mere milestonesâdestitute of sense, Whereas in milestones there's intelligence. Is it for this I waste my time and care, To people all the earth with earthenware; And as a finish to this piece of mockery, To be sole father to a race of crockery! Courage, Prometheus! (post horn without) Ah! what do I see? The Olympian mail car coming straight for me! I know the liveriesâyes, and see! two passengers! Enter Outis at wing, with large fork with sausages on it. Outis. For goodness' sake, Prometheus, try these sassengers! Exit Outis L. 1 E. Prometh. What can they want? Ah! they have separated! It seems to interruption I am fated. Enter Mercury, R. 1 E. Mercury. Prometheus, hail! Prometh. (up at table) Well, what's the news with you? Merc. I've just dropt in to ask you how d'ye do? Apollo came with me, he'll soon be here. Outis. (appearing at L. 1 E.) I say, Prometheus, isn't that the beer? Merc. Madam, 'tis Iâyour humble servant. Outis. Oh! What did he go and call out âhail,â then, so? Exit. Merc. There's Outis out o' sortsâin hand a flask! 'Ow 'tis with her, I think I needn't ask. Outis. (appearing at L. 1 E.) I won't be long! Exit, L. Prometh. Now, may I ask the reason Of your appearance? Merc. Is it out of season? Prometh. Remarkably! I think you've come to spy; It's like you to aspire to play a spy! Of lackey's tricks, no lack is found in you, I'm up to every little plot you brew. Be off! of all your knaveries I'm weary. Merc. (aside) He ne'er shows mercy to a mercenary. (aloud) Pray, why so harsh? (aside) I wonder what's to follow! (red fire at R. 1 E., kept on till the entrance of Outis) Apollo. (without, R. 1 E.) Steady thereâwoa! Merc. Thank goodness there's Apollo! Enter Apollo, R. 1 E. talking to some one outside. Apollo. (R.) Just ease the girths, but see they're safely tied; (Prometheus at table, stirring plaster in bowl) I think you'd better leave the sun outside. Morning, Prometheus! up, I see, and stirring. (aside to Mercury) Found out yet? Merc. (R. C.) No, the question I'm deferring. He's surly! Prometh. (up at table) Always amâI hate late snoozing. (coming forward, L.) Morning, Apollo! Apollo. Manner's not amoozing! Prometh. Just keep your sun a little further, pray. Those steeds of yours will burn my house some day. Fine animals! Apollo. (crossing to C.) That leader came from Sestos; Stands fire well, and so he counts as best 'os. Paced like a racer in his wildest haste, In fact I may say that he's racer paced. Merc. (R.) He seems obstropolous! Apollo. (C.) No! mild, quite mild. I warrant he'd be driven by a child. Prometh. (L.) How about PhÃ¦ton? Apollo. Hem! why you see The very day of that catastropheâ Prometh. and Merc. Yes! yes! Enter Outis, L. 1 E.âgets up stage. Apollo. Just e'er the reins I had transferred, Jove said to me, (it's true upon my word) âApollo,â said he, looking rather blue, âRemember that I told youââ Outis. (coming between Apollo and Prometheus) How d'ye do? (Apollo takes stage over to L.) Prometh. (L. C.) A sad hiatus; what a dreadful sell! Merc. (R.) I hate a story as don't finish well. Trio.âAir, âHome Sweet Home.â Prometh. Were I as wise as Pallas is P'raps I might find, Of that recital What's left behind. Vain all endeavouring, Fancy may roam, But sans intelligence Soon wanders home! Air, âOriginal Schottishe.â Outis. Pray for breakfast, sirs, what may I have the pleasure To prepare? I will unfold my larder's treasure; Trust me, you shall have the fullest measure Of a Titan's hospita-li-tie! Pray take a sophy, tea and coffee ready are, With chops, steaks, kidneys, eggs, and ham, well fed ye are, Nectar and Ambrosia, till you unsteady are, Only give your orders if you please, to me. (repeat ensemble, Mercury and Apollo joining in âharmonizedâat end Mercury, Apollo, and Outis up stage) Prometh. (aside) Now might I do it pat, while he is staying, His visit's Ã propos, so's his delaying, While he is for the next long stage preparing, I'll be at hand to do a deed of daring. (taking a staff from wing, L.) This staff I'll thrust within the blazing wheel, And from its spokes the vital spark I'll steal; With this I will enlighten my clay folks, That fire must make them speak, which comes from spokes. Apollo. (coming down R.) Well, I must go. Outis. (L. C.) Oh! do join our symposia. I've got a case of superfine ambrosia! As for the nectarâhow 'twould please your throttle, I've had it now myself, three weeks in bottle. Merc. (R. C.) What, you keep nectar? Apollo. Why I thoughtâ Outis. You see It's not the genuine commodity. We hav'nt got the capital to spare, It's only chemicals got up with care! With demi-gods you'd not expect to see A costly breakfast for a deity. (dear tea) Apollo. My car! all right. (aside to Mercury) His temper is the deuce; To question now I see would be no use Merc. &amp; Apollo. Farewell, farewell! (red fire at R. 1 E.) Prometh. (crossing over to R.) I'll see you to the door. Apollo. Thank you, don't trouble. Best not venture more. Merc. Oh, mind the flames! Outis. Prometheus! Merc. What's he doing? Apollo. Good gracious! this foolhardiness is ruin. (Prometheus stands in Apollo's wayâthey start back amazed) Prometh. Excuse me if I venture to make free, I've stood your twaddling, now you hear me. You've come to pry and penetrate my planâ In one word hear the truthâmy project's, Man! You've overlooked this grandest of all facts, Prometheus always thinks before he acts. I long have sought in vain to light my clay, And you, Apollo, have supplied the way. Thus, thus I doff the mask, my friends, before ye, And brave your hottest flames like Buonecore. (hurried musicâPrometheus rushes out, R. 1 E., and returns with fire on staff, he touches the models and ignites coloured fires on pedestalsâ the models run off carrying pedestals, &amp;c., with themâPrometheus, Mercury, Outis, and Apollo come forward) Concerted Piece.ââPost Horn Galop.â Apollo. Goodness gracious, goodness gracious! Here's a state of revolution. Merc. Fancy turning contumacious. To our plots here's fine conclusion, Prometh. Think you that I care for you, sir, Though you're mighty highty tighty! Outis. All this comes, my words are true, sir, From being flighty, flighty. Prometh. Victory! I've worked my plan. Merc. You've made, my friend, a precious blunder. Apollo. I must keep my eye on man. Outis. What is he, I wonder?

Eh! what's that? pray what will you know? Jove. Nothing at all, my loveâmy august Juno! Juno. (crossing, L.) Oh, bother! that'll do; there, take your seat, And I'll sit next to you, by way of treat. Jove. My dear! I promised Venusâ Juno. I don't care; If I like, sir, I shall sit anywhere. Jove. Of course! (sighs) Juno. Of course! and here my power to prove, As lawful Queen, I take my seat by Jove! Jove. Don't swear, my dear! (they sit on throne) Juno. Eh! What? Jove. IâI said, Don't swear. Juno.

Well, you are pretty, too! You're lovely! Venus. (L. C.) Sire! you praise too much, methinks. Juno. (L., rising, and going to Jove) Would you encourage that audacious minx? Jove. My love! Juno. Your love! of that I'll be abater, My hate is strong. In fact, I'm glad I hate her. Thank goodness! here's her husband. (they sit on throne.âMusic, âVillage Blacksmith.â) Enter Vulcan, R. U.

Mars, how d'ye do? Why, where have you been? Mars. Looking after you. Venus. Why, hav'nt you been cutting throats and fighting? Mars. My dear, that prospect's not at all inviting. No! I've been (when not looking, love, for you) Doing my usual Fortnightly Review. It's easy and it's dignified, I shirk Much roughing itâBellona does the work. I'm great at mess-time thoughâmy lucubrations Would make you marvel, when I've 'ad my rations; But camping out's detestable! you see, With my health, damp tent bedsteads don't agree. It doesn't strike me that the thought's extaticâ May be romantic, but it's more rheumatic! Venus. You wear a sword, dear? Mars. Which I never wield. Venus.

D'you know, there is some difference between us? Miner. I hate a pun, a quibble, or a jest; Let conversation in plain clothes be dressed. You jeer at Pallas 'cos she's strict and staid. With all your railing you'll need Pallas' aid! Venus. Poor dear old Pallas! Miner. Cease your fun, my dears, There's not much difference in our length of years. Vulcan. (coming forward) Haw! Haw!

Explain! explain! Neptune. Oh, easy as you please! A monstrous fleet is sailing on my seas, With a clay captain and a porcelain mate, Lieutenants, middies, cabins, berths of state, Aping me, Neptune, monarch of the ocean; Offering clay meritâwhat they call promotion. Well! just as I was sitting with my barber, Down tumbled their best bower in my arbour; And when I tried the rascals' course to varyâ All. You blew them overboard? Neptune. No, quite contr?ry.

Well, just look out! Mars. (R.) That's good. Jove. Your insolence too long, sir, we have stood. Neptune. You young loblolly-boy, I just should like To knock your brains out with a marlinspike. Why, darn your impudence? Prometh. (C.) There, stop your clatter. With all your darning you'll not mend the matter. Neptune. Oh, Jove, pray punish this young chap's presumin'. Prometh.

Ah, Madam Venus. sulkin'? There, go to Mars; he'll please you after Vulcan. Mars. (R. corner) Villain! Prometh. There, stop! your face, so broad and spacious, Seems like a sort of writ of fiery facias. Bosh! Some may think, because you long have blustered, You'd give them pepper when your force is mustered.

Who's this exhilarated female party? Prometh. (R. C.) My mother, Jove. Outis. Prometheus, if you knew, The trouble that I've had to get to you. Merc. (L. corner) I brought her, and her bandbox; yes, I staid for it. Outis. And so you ought, sir, seeing that I paid for it. He wouldn't take me gratis, dear, not he, Though in the greatest of anxiety, So I agreed; a shilling out I drew, My only one, exclaiming âVoila tout.â Jove. (on throne) Madam, retire; we wish to spare your ears The prisoner's sentence. (Outis collapses) Prometh. Mother, dry your tears. Outis. One day, great Jove; just to collect his powers. Jove. No; not a minuteânow the chance is ours. Take him away. (two Gods seize him) His sentence is deferred Prometh. I'll have a reckoning for this, take my word. Outis. A reckoning now you're 'ad up.

By Jove remanded till I can suggest Enter Venus, unobserved, L. 1 E. A punishment that suits his crime the best. I'm at my wit's end! Venus. (touching him) You'd not far to go. Apollo. Venus! how could you start a fellah so? Venus. Well, have you thought of anything? Apollo. Of course; I mean to tie him on a bare-backed horse. Venus. Pooh! we've all seen that long ago; it takes At Astley's, dear, with the extensive rakes. His men can save him too. Apollo. He's not to die, But miserably linger. Venus. Cruelty! But now to business, PhÅbusâI've a plan! To please, to plague, in short, to do for man. A healing balm to woundâa curse to bless himâ A truth to gullâa comfort to distress him; To bring him all his joys and all his fears, To set him and his fellows by the ears, To make the greybeard doteâthe youthful sadâ Turn wisdom foolishness, drive reason mad: To sway the world, and nations' hearts to wring, To beâ Apollo.

Escaped at length! most cleverly eluded, I got out smartly, as the other crew did. What will be done with me? I dare say Jove, Who's rather anxious for his throne above, Will seek revenge on his rebellious slavey; Shut in some cave, he'll make me cry peccavi. Or, as he cannot touch my life, will try And make existence one long misery.

Too proud to make a meek appeal, I still support my Titan claim, Which they heed no more than if I, From Constantinople cameâ Constantinople, etc., It counts the same. Their jeers and taunts can little move, A soul so great as this is; But 'tis the faithlessness of Jove, And his revengeful missis! Since e'er his usurpation, we Lived on a footing quite the same; No wonder now that I, his being Constant to no pal, blame Constant to no pal, &amp;c., It's that I blame. What will become of me.

Why, see, he winks; I beg your pardon, are you Stodare's Sphinx? Sun. No, I'm an oracle! Prometh. What a colossus! You look more like the famed Anthropoglossus. But since you're such a swell, perhaps you would'nt Mind telling me my fortune! Sun. No, I should'nt. Jove has designed your overthrow! Prometh. Oh, goodness! Sun. Don't interrupt me. Prometh. Pardon, pray, my rudeness. Sun. He's had a box constructed, which contains Life's horrors, sorrows, evils, aches, and pains. This box as dowry to your wife he gives. Prometh. I have no wife. Sun. 'Tis but this hour she livesâ Vulcan has made her! Prometh. Here's a pretty pass! Sun. One thing should recommend herâshe's got brass; Out of that metal she was fabricated. Prometh. To this belle metal, then, it seems I'm mated. Sun. Too trueâbut mind that box. Apollo. (outside, L.) He's gone! hallo! Prometh. Apollo's voice! I'd best be off. Sun. No go, I fear; but, run! perhaps my dread is vain; At all events, my friend, we'll meet again. (Sun-head disappears.âLights up.âPrometheus exits, R.) Enter Apollo and Venus, L. Apollo. (R.)

He must be here about! Yes! Venus. What? Apollo. (as Captain O'Scuttle, crossing to L.) Ha! (crossing back to R.) No! Venus. Good gracious, PhÅbus! pray don't bellow so. Apollo.

For which you'll blameâArtemus Ward, his book. (Exeunt, R.) Enter Outis, L. Outis. This sort of woe's too terrible to last; I don't move much, and yet I'm going fast. Once I was plump and stout, and full in feature, Almost as fat as pork, alas! poor creature! Now, what a different case; what woful plight; I shouldn't wonder if my hair's turned white. (looks) No; still the same bright thing it was. Alas! Matters have come now to a pretty pass. I'm out upon parole, they don't mind me; They've only seized upon Prometheus; he Is sternly waiting for his doom to-day. What will they do with me, I wonder, pray? P'raps put me up for marriage!

So! so! Miner. (R.) There's no expression in a feature! Juno. (L. C.) Too short! Mercury. Too tall! Apollo. (L.) Fine eyes, hair not amiss! Jove. Truce to your sneers and gibes, I say; drop this. I hereby give command that every goddess, Who owns a charm that's fit for human bodies, If they have anything, be quick in giving, And let this maid eclipse all after living. First for her title. Mars. (R.) Silence in the court! Jove. This maiden's claim we settle to support. Mars. Si-lence! Jove. An awful voiceâa downright crusher. Hush! Mars. 'Tis my business, sir, as I'm a husher. Jove. Well, hear me swear by Styx, I grant her fame, By giving her a most expressive name, And so I call herâ Mars. Silence for a floorer! Jove. Call her the model woman, and Pandora. (cheers by All) And now, Pandora, do not think me grudging, When I inform you, you must now be trudging. First take this box, it isn't heavy, feel it; Don't let a soul beg, borrow it, or steal it; Into your husband's hands place it alone, He'll open it himself. Juno. (melodramatically) Is't done? Jove. (melodramatically) 'Tis done. Mars. Say, may I have the pleasure to escort? Apollo. No. May I, madam? Mars. Sir! Pooh, that's your sort! Vulcan. Let me. Neptune. No! Brother Vulcan, you're too slow. I'll take the jolly little craft in tow. Jove. Now cease at once this flow of eloquence, Mercury will conduct the maid from hence. Mars. Confound the puppy! Mercury. (crossing to Pandora Hem! Jove. Well dear, good bye. Venus. We shall expect to see you in the sky. Juno. We'll call and visit you, of course, my dear. Mars. Don't be surprised to see me re-appear. Apollo. (and all the other gods) And me, and me, &amp;c. Jove. That style urbane will be his bane I see, Here, Mercury, that box, Pandora's dowry. Minerva. (R.) (to Mercury, who goes off R. with Pandora taking no notice of what Minerva says) Take an umbrella, Merky, it looks show'ry. Exit R. offended at Mercury's indifference Jove. (aside) It holds all evils in that little space, Doom and destruction to the human race, Prometheus, if he opens it is lost, And all his projects to the winds are tossed. This beats Pandora, betterer and betterer, Revenge, ha! ha! he! he! ho! ho! etcetera. ChorusââKafoozleum.â Jove. Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, She'll bamboozle 'em. Chorus Fol de rol de rido. Jove. If my scheme's of any worth. From the moment of her birth, She will play the deuce on earth, Chorus. Fol de rol de rido. Apollo. Though old as Methusalem, &amp;c. She'll manage to bamboozle 'em, Chorus. Fol de rol de rido. Apollo. Be they young or be they grey, She with them the deuce will play, So I've only got to say, All. Fal de rol de rido. (Short dance and all of, R. 1 E. leaving Mars and Venus on, who continue dance and off, R.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. âRocky shore and crags of Caucasusâ working waters down to back of 1st groovesâset rockâ piece, L., with Prometheus discovered chained to itâ vulture hanging over himâworking sun in flats, R.â sunset. Music.ââOn Yonder Rock Reclining.â Prometh. On this hard rock reclining, A sad and suffering form behold, Doomed to perpetual pining, Thro' rain and heat and cold. Fixed firm and fast, I hardly can say for good you know; Seeing as how I must suffer here, When stormy winds do blow.âoh! (change to âOne Horse Shayâ) I feel so like Mazeppa, When he's tied upon his stepper, The âfiery untamed steed,â as the playbills say; But the creature as we know, Tho' they make him caper so, Is less fitted for a hero than a One horse shay. Prometheus It's getting rather painful, this position Not being an acrobatic exhibition. Fancy being fixed here for infinity, Thus cragged so picturesquely by the sea. Ha! horrid bird! with fear my limbs all shiver. See! how he comes and lights upon my liver. I say get out! (Vulture flies off) Thank you, obliging vulture! It's too much to be eaten e'er sepulture. (sun sinks) There goes the sun; in spite of what he said His promise must have slipped out of his head. (sings) âShades of evening close not o'er us,â Sun. (re-appearing) Tol de riddle ol de loll loll lay. Prometh. What, old friend, back again; that's very queer, How do you manage thus to re-appear? Sun. It's a stage trick. (eyes work) Prometh. Why are your eyes thus rolling? Sun. I grieve to see you lying like Tom Bowling, Quite a sheer hulk. Prometh. You know I'm fixed for ever. Sun. What a conclusion for a chap so clever! Wait till your wife comes, she will set you free. Prometh. The only time she'll give me liberty. Sun. Remember, mind, don't ope that box. Prometh. All right. How good to have a friend at court. Sun. Good night! Prometh. What! must you go? Your shades pray don't close o'er us; Or if you must, at least assist as chorus. Air, âMidas.â Prometheus Since you mean to sink for good, sir, Pray don't send your dews too soon; I should thank you if you would, sir, Send your substitute, the moon. Prometh., Sun. Fol de riddle lol, &amp;c., &amp;c. (Sun sinks) Enter Mercury, Pandora, and Outis, R. 1 E. Outis. Step softly, dear Pandora! Should he sleep, At his perfections you can take a peep. Here is a precious state of things for he, Once brought up in the lux of lapsury! Pando. I feel so bashful. Outis. Well, perhaps you do; I used to feel so, dear, when young as you. Merc. Well, as I've seen you now so far, I'll go. Here is your box. Outis. (takes box) Ha! let me see. Prometh. Hallo! That is the box I'm warned against, no doubt, And that's my spouse to be when I get out. Merc. Ha! see he wakes! allow me, dearâPandora! (introducing) Prometheus Know each other. Prometh. I'm before her; Thanks to a friendly hint received, I know Precisely all the circumstances. Outis. Oh! If I could only find out what's in here. Something remarkable, I've an idea. Pandora, love! (Pandora goes to her) Merc. (to Prometheus) So here you're fast, my friend. I guessed how your absurdities would end. Prometh. They've ended, have they? Merc. Rather; I suppose Your punishment won't have so short a close, For thirty thousand years you're fixed up here. Prometh. (L.) And is that all they'll do to me, my dear? (as in âArrah na Pogueâ) Merc. (L.) Allâall? it's quite enough, I think, to try, Even a Titan's courage. Outis. (R.) Hallo! Why, It's not locked after allâhere goesâoh my! (hurried musicâthunder, &amp;c.âstage darkâOutis faintsâPandora runs offâEnter all the Characters, R. 1 E.) Outis. Murder! help! murder! Jove. (R. C.) So my scheme's succeeded. Prometh. Yet all your ingenuity was needed. All. (R.) We are avenged! Prometh. Yes, I must own you've won. Apollo (R.) You'll pay back what you borrowed from the Sunâ And for this trick, which ruins all mythology, I think you owe Apollo an apolo-gy. Prometh. Impossible! you see mankind has gained A principle, from you, my friend, obtained, Which makes them free for ever. Jove. But you know They've got a thousand evils now en dÃ´t. Prometh. Too true! all's lost! I'm beaten and give in. Outis. Which throwing up the sponge, dear, is a sin! All. Yield, Titan bold! Prometh. Yes, yes, I yield! Hope. (rising, C.âshort hurry) Not so, There's still a hope left. Jove. (R. C.) Who are you? All. (R.) Hallo! Hope. (C.) Why I am Hope! You thought your scheme you'd worked, But at the bottom of that box I lurked. Apollo. What 'mongst the ills of man? Jove. A horrid sell! Outis. Why then you've left the bottom of your well. Hope. Though you've infested all mankind with pains, Woes, sorrows, evils, yet still hope remains. To hope he'll look when troubled clouds may lower, And hope will always soothe his latest hour. Prometheus, throw your chains away. There, see, While hope is by himâman is ever free. (Prometheus throws off chains and comes forward C., Hope goes on rock) Jove. (L. C.) Well, then it seems I'm beaten after all, So here I will your punishment recall. I give you freedom now with cordiality, And greet your libertyâ Outis. With Jovi-ality. (cheers) Prometh. (to Audience) And say now what can poor Prometheus do, But trust to hope and still appeal to you? You are the only arbiters of fate, You weigh the merits of our little state. We still must hope your favours to obtain, We, who have never sued to you in vain. Prometheus claims from you a kind excuse For all this follyâsure you'll not refuse? Deal gently with his caseâaccept his cause, And let your verdict kindly be applause. Finale.âAir, âIsn't it a Pullback.â Prometh. And now our piece is ended For fun alone intended, If 'tis by you commended, Reward we get in full back Of joys besides a full whack, And nothing like a pull back. Ho, hi, ho, joys at its prime oh! Oh, hi, ho, &amp;c. At Christmas time oh! Oh, hi, ho, &amp;c. Air, âThe Harp that once through Tara's Halls.â Chorus. Cheer us now and on our play With lenient eyes look down, Prometheus lives if you but smile, He dies if you should frown. Oh! bid him live and wreath around His brow success's crown. (walk roundâdance) Hope on rock. Prometheus. Outis. Juno. Minerva. Jove. Vulcan. Neptune. Venus. Apollo. Mars. Mercury. R. L. (Tableau.) Curtain.</field>
