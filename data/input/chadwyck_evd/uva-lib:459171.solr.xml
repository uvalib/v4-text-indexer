Pray let them trace heere, scoole, and goe to trap; let some come home sick, &amp; loll in grannam's lap. let some be whip't &amp; sterved to death; whilst clownes doe reepe their trulls, &amp; pay nought for the downes. let some be cow'd; cleare drein'd into despaire: whilst harlots in their houses, curle their haire. let other's keepe a hawke, a dog, a parret: let others snap at browne crusts, &amp; a Carret. let some admire their paedagoge; &amp; learne for to advance the tincture of his bearne, and how he perses homer: 'till at last, his portion drawne, he be in loves Pound Cast. yet let him thinke it well; &amp; mend no letter: All's good to him, which nere knew ought that's better.</field>

And thus farre are we come, with right good speed; Noe rubb did much offend us: that's the prime of every action, when the strength of monney can ripen a rich harvest for the sicle of one good meaninge: then the blooming bud doth softly ripen a prosperity. Whereas to stop our hopes with want, &amp; wyerdraw out our deepe occassions, (which weightily doe make or marre a state) This folly oftentimes doth wound the body of our most deare Intentions, &amp; surround us amidst our thoughts' &amp; comments politique. Mr Hollowheart âwe have indeed (good brother) prettily well indifferent well I say, encompassed the grudge of all the foes 'to your estate; and drawne a cypresse, 'fore the waining light of the decaied symptoms left unto yee; but yet all is not done; Sir Wary not all yet done? you say true (brother) more is to be done. I'le call in all my monneys personall, and send my servant Blinko to spy out a purchase for a seat to place my baggs on. good earth is solid; flashy paper light: houses but candle rents: ground feares no blight. Lady. I pray sweet doe! call for your monneys quickly The scrivener much deceaves yee: bonds are paper: &amp; credit sincks, where reputation's lost. At best, the trade's uncomly for high blood; It seldom does the noble any good. vertue and honour claime a share in such to make vile gaines wise people think it much. Sir Wary. I shall effect thy counsell very shortly: I like good solid earth: this paltry Coine Is like old homers, ???? ????????? I think your purchasers (most of them) are graecians. 'Tis store will make a frozen melancholy (for all your mortifying sharpe dicteriums) to pergraecari, skip, &amp; friske it oft. wellâwellâthis manour itches. Holl. rub sir, rubbe. 'Tis well you can rub, where it itches, brother. your debters rub, oft where it doth not Itch. pray call not in your bonds soe soone; one match is yet to make before this mocke water. what? Shall my cozen Claribell sit downe &amp; keep your conies, or your colts, or sheepe, in the new mannour perke? because her hopes are buried in a new Inheritance, for my younge nephewes, who are heyres in Taile. Pray think on her, shee is your very child your very lovely child. I think hee's purg'd. aside. Sir Wary. Tis true she is soe; and Ile place her first. for noe girle shall soare aloft in my deceasd estate. They'l loose our name. o for a brave male issue to be an heyre to 5 and 40 mannours! Tingle. âI, god send it, Sir, I hope 'twill not be long ere that I see it beare up my sisters apron; faith these robes doe not become you sister. Lady Wast. âwell thats' all one; when it shall please my starrs I may conceave: before the fates deny. or should I? what fortune would attend my child would pose the Artists in their horoscope. Sir Wary. Well! would it please the supreme deity the feeder of our nature &amp; emplanter of all the secret moisture in our veines which springs an action for humanity: to lend an aide beyond these sterved powers to quicken happy life, &amp; masculine attractive spright, within dame natures Arke; I would sollicite every minutes passe, with a robustious micant horizon, which should breathe forth the strong desire of him whose emulation, &amp; sole chiefest aime is soe to be expressd, but in the shape and pourtraid by a stripling of my owne. Hollowh. I shall arrest those praises, sir, untill I see a better warrant from above. Tingle. pray! let them breath; thei'r pious: to desire is modest asking: boldnesse to require. Lady W. âwhen nature pleaseth, I shall fitted bee I hope for fruitfull &amp; blest progeny. men wish to please their fancies: but they'r serv'd when time is fitted, or the bones deserv'd, I pray as much as any: to want race is womans skorne; which doth here quite deface. A numerous issue is a mothers pleasure a fathers joy, welbred; a grandsires treasure. Sir Wary. Let's put a period then, and recreate our weary thoughts, which busied were with state: to observe our owne occasions does us good, but too much dulnesse childs &amp; dreines our blood. A little of the one, commends the other: This is the way to make your wife a mother. Finis ac. 1 secaena. 1. scaena 2 enter Mistress Claribell, Saena her maid; Mr Hodgepodge, alias Hodgefeild; Mr Simple &amp; his page. Mr Hodgefeild. Pray Mistress Saena! turne not now away. this is the making or the marring houre, in which my blisse is crossd, or perfited. Saena. I must confesse; it somewhat may Concerne yee to get all now Compleated; for 'tis time which oft Combines impossibilities, &amp; knits the wary characters of art; A season strain'd can conquer Victory, &amp; crowne each faculty with a due pleas'd worth. Yet must I work this for yee? &amp; have nought? noe point of true dimension from your favour? noe tincture from a generous feeling pulse? nor any moiety for my diligence? you know 'tis in our power to cross a match: yes! though the wedding gowne be made &amp; witnesse, put to th'agreement: though a father call &amp; mother mak't a match: we have a power ore all these parcell child-commanders: neither fore the conjunction does praevaile our Art. we can pause after stroakes; and sometimes lock the wrangling Theseus in a Labyrinth. make our deare mistresse lick up our frothy humours &amp; vomit part out, in her husbands face, whilst you shall hold her, thus! and I will fetch to countenance the deed, the next hot water. besides we can persuade, well for a neede, &amp; turn the application of our mistresse to what addiction our owne bow is bent. Turne upside downe Conclusions; and convert the poinant humour to our purposes. These things our skill, can compasse, had it merit. Mr Hodgefeild; merit doeth plead; heere take it correspondent To a most ready &amp; most praegnant art, There; hold. Saena Pray sir, surcease we are not so submisse, to prostitute our tounge, (I shall deserve it;) for your forgotten bounties harbinger. True bounty Counts Convenience; &amp; then comes must lonely faire excepted: but thrust forward (without that hiew of rich discretion) Is duld &amp; blunted by a sad repulse. poise but my constitution: Can yee finde a posy for soe base an Anagram, implanted in my ill fixt horoscope? or that my physiognomy doest portend a Stigma, for so ready Trechery? Though I can doe, it may be, very much, with my younge mystresse: tis not so easy meanes shall swallow up my firme laid faith to her; And soe I leave youâ. Mr Hodgefeild. O! my hope is gone the best of sutors woo by servants aide. when feare &amp; errour makes them soone afraide a prompter can encoradge, &amp; lett in; so doe the weakest glorious prizes winne. Audacious proper wooing without ground distastes your mistresse; doth your selfe confound. but yet some Comforts aide mee.â Claribell âstill troubled in my maiden thoughts? Mr Hodgefeild. my mistresse voice, &amp; person doth appeare as doth the glorious sunne; when rising from her watry couch shee guilds' the hemisphere &amp; lightens all concavities below,â with the reflexion of a gratefull beame. now dearest Jaylour of a weary soule, (weary'd for that 'tis kept soe much within) release my agony'de sence, &amp; entertaine my dried limbes, within those blest precincts may put mee from all thought of misery. seale mee a long expected resolution to free mee from these bonds, and cares that vexe the truest heart of a right suppliant; and I shall shrine thee in my heart a godesse. Claribell; why then in briefe; I love thee &amp; have longe entyrely lov'd thee; but 'tis vanity for me to say I love: &amp; the ould man that perches ore all our greene-siknesse walle as yet against it: were he but once dispatch'd, we quickly would seale up this difference. Mr Hodgef. can he be not once mov'd? they say, loves potent, &amp; can doe much: time wearies hoary oakes; which shew a stiffe &amp; venerable age. Time flawes the hardned jawes of rocky flints, and weares a passadge, to eternall night; and chaseth bedded sorrowes; which if plac't in the fell chambers of a touch't remorse had eaten up the vitall entrailes, and enclosd the subject with envenoumd phanges. yet by this medicine hath these ferall rootes been pluckt, discerpt &amp; dride' all into nothinge: &amp; sometimes washt with a Laethaean flood. why should not then an Importunity, (which wearies time &amp; massacres discretion;) command with helpe of love, soe small a boone, as to envolve, both hearts of ours in one? Claribell. I wish it may be soe: &amp; were not curses that come from parents loathed exescrations of a most deadely, &amp; a viperous nature I would attempt yet somewhat: now farewell; I may noe more be seene.â Mr. Hodgefeild. was ever man soe bless't, &amp; yet so cross't? Soe bless't in a most comming, loving mistresse, which sends paternall aide through every blush (as fragrant as the sweet Arabian gummes) unto her poore, distressed, loyall servant: soe cursed, in a hatefull stoppage causd by her most impious, &amp; unweldy father: whose words like charmes, do hunt me from these thresholds, &amp; make mee sing my griefe to philomell. o! blessing drop't from the eternall sky! o heavenly mixture of Ambrosia. mixed by the fates for some all happy soules, to have in the height of Love an unity; a correspondence in our dear affections which may replante, what time doth rend away, &amp; blow alive the mortifyde cynders of syncere liking, &amp; true affiance, (neglected by forbidden Amoretts,) into the dull relapse of dusty embers. yee gods; which sit on winged chairs to governe the sad &amp; changeable scaene of mortall acts, direct my constant passage on this stage That I may draw a just catastrophe. without the insulting voice of a full chorus: &amp; then respire my last, in lovely armes more warme to mee, then is soft zephyrus when shee arrives to ticle deynty flora. may these things blesse mee: &amp; I live to see the old man dy, and Claribell with mee. scaena. 3. (enter to him Mr Simple, &amp; page.) Simple. by your leave good cozen Hodgefeild, I am come to call you to the bearebaiting; yonder is old sackerson to be baited; all the doggs are ready, &amp; the beare already mussled. come will yee goe? Hodgefeild. not now kind cozen Simple. Ime employde this afternoone, &amp; so engaged, I cannot attend your sports. Simple. why then, you loose most noble sport, I tell yee better then any game Cupid can play. play, meethinksâ when the beare fights, especially Sackerson (or the soone of sacke, which wine sure makes himm valiant;) mars or minerva should assist the sport It is soe noble; I am sure the gods sport at it &amp; therefore looke a care for to translate, neere the trallucent starre of ursa major (the ancestour of Sackerson) the fiery tribe of starres, which waite on the caelestial curve. Hodge. I vow; the beares have made my cozen frantique, synce when so learned cozen! Simp. ever sinceâI loved the sport; all recreation makes that once a man delights in, every subject as noble, as the arts themselves Can make him. the exercise of ringing makes men Statists &amp; learnes them soe to change your tune each minute with this most subtle posy; he can't live, that cannot readily change, &amp; dissemble. this exercise doth teach the wise professour to hold his peace &amp; sound in a true distance, or else, that needes he must run ore &amp; jangle. It teaches men likewise the noble art of memory, &amp; how by figures swiftly to broach a new arithmetique from the changes. Then hunting (by wise Xenaphon) is calld an image &amp; an exercise of warre. the flying at the brooke is an Idea of natural philosophy: by the which the natural passes of the aire to water &amp; water into Aire, are most rarely &amp; solidly demonstrated; then fishing doth teach us, how to sift the seas &amp; to make way for navigation by groping under waters with a plummet. Hodge. prithee! have done good, cozen wise good cheape, thou art now noe Simple scoller. Simp. butâcozâHodgefeild! the exercise of beare-baiting is the only Caelestiall sport! Hodge.

Thinke you so Sir? Sir Fran. I am sure they doe man. I have read in authors that zoroasters who was held a great magitian; first invented dice, &amp; usd to play himselfe at hazard: till he left his Kingdome &amp; then turned enchanter, and made castles &amp; pallaces in the Aire.â James. you see then that the dice may loose whole Kingdome's in a little time. Sir Fran. &amp; winne them too, if they have good luck, man: none looses, but some winne: say I should loose the moyety of my patrimony: he that winnes would beare my part: as it is reported they doo in France, where he that gets the fortune carries the honor with it.â James. but grieves it not your very soule, to be thus disposed off by th'fortunes of the dice?â Sir Fran. not a tittle! a man's not fitt for to be calld a gamester, which (had hee all the empyres of the world in his possession;) cannot with a touch a gentle touch laid on his curled chinne forfeit them all to chance. James. certainely good gamesters may be termed Stoiques; or the strictest stoiques were your professed patrons.â Sir Fr. stoiques! noe they were a kind of stoiques; only heere heere is the difference; stoiques were philosophers in the theory of things; but we are bent only for practice. Jam. otherwise your patience is equally respective. Sir F. mistake mee not (my worthy Iago) we are only patient patient, (dost marke mee) only with the bones; but otherwise, we are more furious then the Lybian Lyons, or Hyrcannian Tigers. noe wasp or hornet hath such Stings.â James. yet (by your favour Sir) I have seen your gallants mad as march hares, fling a whole balle of dice over their shoulders into the next fire; teare cards in peeces, with their teeth &amp; eate them burne tablemen like chips; &amp; in their passion blaspheme whole houres togetherâ Sir Fran. and this they did in passion? thinkst thou soe? Jam: I surely soe I tooke it. Sir Fra. I see sometimes men may be much deceav'd: a cleane mistake may soone be made of action. listen Iago when they threw bales of dice into the fire twas only to change lucke, &amp; prevent cheating. eating of cardes, was most expedient for those which had papermills, &amp; dind with duke humphrey. burning of tablemen had a mystery, for beeing greasy, they sav'd wood; &amp; swearing bound many to their good behavior; soe that they could play noe more for a whole month or two.

I now begin to thinke, of that exotique course the great mogoll doth use, when that each yeare he weighs himselfe, against much pretious treasure; whereby he doth conjecture of the state of his full beeing:âI will immitate his goodly course: &amp; in the empty scale place the Rancheria, where the pearles are taken the other scale, my selfe will fill, with Cushions made of Sir Waryes old Indentures; when the Islande of the pearles wil shrinke &amp; give leave that my selfe, then Spaine, shall richer live.

Ennius the father of old poets sunke low in his verse, when he could not be drunke. Sir Pet. how can it choose be otherwise? the spirits without the fluxure of the grape are stupid? the braines are overmoist, the vertue weake of the capacity; all the faculties frozen without the opening of the Sun. but as that shining, &amp; aeternall planet comforts the whole horizon, with his cheare: so doth his eldest son of plants, the noble &amp; nimble vine, chase away all the clouds of heavy spleene; and make the soule ascend the highest haemisphaere of the best invention.

(4) mirth &amp; unmixt merry glee is the thing we ayme at, all: Joviall drinking on our Knee, when that we are like to fall. quiet whiffing up and downe our verinaes misty cloud, never drawne once by the clowne which exalted whoopes soe loud. (5) If by chance a nimble cup of the lesbian grape arrives, we will surely drinke it up, to our doxeys or our wives; This is the most learned Course, for to warme our chilled soules to let in a Joviall source through the bottom of the bowles. Sir Ran. an exsquisite fine ditty &amp; much pitty it is not printed, with the elegant picture of a black Indian smoaking boy, &amp; pasted in every taphouse by the chimney side.

Doe good Blinko: make ye best hast you can, or else this monyed, mighty, &amp; potent Wary may keepe his bed still, as they doe, when that most ferall pestilence, doth besiege the houses of the sick patients. 'tis not pelfe can helpe a dying usurer, nay, nor lay his bones in the damp vaults of his dead ancestors. Drosse of the earth, &amp; guilded ore cannot prove to dead masters, dutious harbingers; unlesse the charity of surviving friends be calld into the action: who hath not read, how Craesus with his riches were almost buried alive together in one pile! how the great pompey had his head strucke off by the command of a Corrupted eueneuch; &amp; so for some dayes did want an earthy covering? how Alexander magnus being poisoned for some, daies was left lying on his bed a gazing stocke for every vulgar eye? how, william that brave Norman, which run ore with good successe most of the saxon ground had 7 foote purchased in the city Cave with much adoe, for his poore sepulcre; how henry 2d of that name of england, (unhappy in his most perfidious children) was at his death most basely pillaged, even in the time of peace, &amp; stripped too the very skin: untill a little boy did with his Cloke (as some old storyes tell) cover the King: thence called short mantle. why should I speake of the 3rd victorious edward, who by Alice perris, whilst he lay ful sicke was pillagd (as some say) unto the quick. Vaine man, then cast of base unworldly hopes who ere thou art; &amp; think not thy gold, but that thy vertue shall preserve thy name, longer then marble columnes; or the adamant encircling stones, &amp; when all earthly things shall fade away: then virtue comfort brings.

Hod. and was there much good sport Sir. Symp. o most admirable! the North beare, I meane the constellation that's calld the beare mistaken, neere made such admirable sport. Hod. I understand you not, you are soe learned in your discourse of new arctophylax Sym. Indeed the paraphrase is mysterious. and therefore plainely to the matter, once on a good time (for soe all tales begin) there liv'd an ignorant empirique, which professd to cure men troubled with a Lunacy, or for to quiet, crased phrenetique braines. This sottish empirique with more ostentation, by much, then true ability; had gotten into his charge a young Astronomer that was gone mad, with oremuch starregazinge; and when the student would by chance begin discourse of divers constellations, then would the silly grosse empirique sot command his cerberus, or his servant Jailour to set upon him with a holly wand, or Tough bulls-pissel: &amp; to strap him soundly, persuading the poore fellow, that he rav'd.
