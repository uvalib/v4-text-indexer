      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Scene I. Faust's Study. Faust discovered. Faust [gazing into magic mirror]. I look in vain!âAll dazzling emptiness! My magic mirror hath no sign or symbol Of coming joy to meâfalse, lying radiance! Here left, upon this dawning Easter morn, A man without a fear, without a hopeâ A man who neither can believe or trembleâ I have grown white, delving in books for knowledge, Theology, philosophy, and science: All on my tongue, in endless flow of words, A cobweb, vast, of juggle, lies, and mummery. Must I live on from nothingness to nothingness, From yesterday to struggle to forget Unto to-morrow, which I'll meet with loathing.â Whilst night and morn, with silent hint there stands, Before mine eye, a gentle, full release. Thou precious phial! Hail! . . . With reverent hand I take thee down, thou fatal sleepy friend. Here is a brew will mantle in the void Of the toilworn heart and brain. It is my choice, And as a solemn greeting to the morn, With all my soul I quaff. [About to drink. Sound of bells and Easter Hymn. Hymn. Joy unto mortals, He hath arisen Forth from death's portalsâfrom the grave's prison, Lo! He ascendeth! Join ye the chorus! Angels are singing and worshipping o'er us. Hymn of Women. With spice we embalmed Himâwith linen we swathed Him, With tears of the loving and faithful we bathed Him; In burial we laid Him with prayer and with tearâ The stone is upliftedâthe Lord is not here! Faust. These far clear strains they seem to win my hand From its intent. These hollow-sounding bells, proclaim The sacred hour of Easter Festival! In white young days, when prayer was joyfulness Every sweet Sabbath peal upon mine ear, Seemed to my soul a kiss of heavenly love; And as the chimes came to me o'er the hills, Mine eyes have filled with tears of mystic longing. Peal on! Peal on, ye sweet and holy sounds, Ye heavenly tones so soft and ravishing! What's that? a stir of life withoutâyet not The footstep of a visitor. Why, 'tis the hound which followed me last night: Poor beastâhow lean and desolate you look. Gambolling round my melancholy steps Upon the mountain path, you gladdened me, Take in return my hospitality. Since those sweet Easter strains, there seems A gentle, peaceful look of home around, And my lamp burns with quiet, friendly ray. Still, still contentment dwells not in this breast, Strange, withering thoughts are thereâ Here left in my age, bare, blank, aghast, A fear unto myself. This ache pass from my heart. How dimly burns the lampâthe moon is hidâ And, what grows thereâa shadow or a spectre? The hound transformed to phantom or to demon:â And I remember, when it met me first It was the fatal desperate moment when There burst from me a passionate appeal To evil powers, if they should hear, to aid me. Monster! I will unmask thee! Song of evil spirits without. Song. Some one, within, is caught! Stay without, follow him not! Like the fox in a snare, Quakes the old hell-lynx there. Take heedâlook about! [Faust.] What sounds are those? If that thou art a fiend, I will exorcise thee! My magic power I summon to my aid! The mighty Spell of Four will I pronounce. Fiery salamander glow! Water-nymph in water flow! Sylph in meteor-flame array! Incubus! come forth! obey! [Faust.] It stirs not! then by a mightier name I swear To conjure and to charm thee! By the sign and by the spell, Before which vanish the black spirits of the air!â See, see! it rises to the vaulted roofâ It fills the space with mist. Down to my feet! Dar'st thou endure my spell of strongest might, With holy fire will I scorch and sting thee! Down, down at thy master's feet. [Mephistopheles appears through the mist. Mephis. What are my lord's commands? Faust. Who art thou? Mephis. We have met before? Faust. Where? when? Mephis. As a black hound I've tracked your steps And gamboll'd round you in your studious walks. Faust. And now thou comest as some travelling scholar? Tell me thy name and nature. Mephis. A frivolous inquiry this from you. Art thou not he who seeks the heart of things, And laughs at names? Faust. Ha, ha! See here this skullâ Canst thou set eyes within these hollow sockets, Give it a tongue to tell its earthy secret? Mephis. [taking skull]. Who knows? I might, If these two jaws could wag again to words. There is no secret worth the telling. Merely 'Twould sayââDoctor, I'm dead and damned.â This was a woman ruined by her lover. She died upon the scaffoldâfor a crime. Faust. What art thou? Mephis. I am the Spirit that all good denies: My proper element is Sin, the Bad, Destruction! for whate'er to light is brought I strive to killâdestroy. Faust. Then I am face to face with thee. Mephis. With me, that genial friend, who never fails, When summoned, to appear. Faust. And thou hast but thy clenchÃ¨d devil's fist, To menace with a malice impotent The great creative Power! Poor son of chaos, Select thou some more profitable calling. Mephis. That we'll discuss hereafter, when I visit you again; [Sees Pentagram and stops.] I will not tarry now.â With your permission, Doctor, I would now depart. Faust. You do not need my leave; why stare and ponder? Mephis. There is a trifling obstacle withstands. That wizard's foot upon your threshold thereâ For ghosts and devils 'tis a law By the same way they enter must they go. Faust. So, 'tis the pentagram that puzzles thee. But how, then, didst thou cross its lines, When thou, who cannot hence, didst enter here? Mephis. A simple answerâthe magician bungled, And left an inner angle slightly open. It did admit, but will not let me forth. Faust. Then even in hell you have your binding laws. What law, then, governeth a devil's bond? Mephis. Release me nowâsoon will I come again; When thou shalt question me, at thy free will. Faust. It is not every day we catch a fiend; So I will hold thee fast. Mephis. Content thee! since my presence charms thee so, And I will justify thy good opinion. In airy bandsâI spin an artless charm; Hark to my spirits' song! In one short hour thou shalt more pleasure taste Than a whole year of life like thine can give. [Song of Spirits. Visions. Spirits' Chorus. Vanish, ye darkling Vaults that hang over him! Glancingly hither Let the blue ether Kindly look in. Clouds that were darkling Melt disappearing, Little stars sparkling, Glimmer within, Infinite longing Soon will have smote him, Falling like shadows, Cover the meadows, Cover the bowers, &amp;c. &amp;c. Mephis. He sleeps! My dainty sprites, your slumb'rous melody Alights upon his eyelidsâHush! he sleepsâ Not yet, good doctor, can you catch the devil! Now for thy vaunted wizard pentagram. A rat's quick tooth will break this threshold's spell. Hark! how my own pet vermin rustles in the casement! The lord of the frogs and the mice and the rats, Of the fleas and the flies and the bugs and the bats, Commands you with your sharp tooth's saw The threshold of this door to gnaw. Ha! little minister, here comest thou hopping To work with tiny saw upon that lineâ Come, nibble, nibbleâhereâanother bite, One moreâ'tis doneâthe lock is gone, Dream, Faust, until we meet again, dream on! [Exit. [Vision fadesâPause.] Faust (waking). A voice is in mine earâI have been sleeping, There seems to be entrancement in the air. Stay. . . . Whither is he fled, my visitor? Is all a cheat? Methought I held him here In magic barricadeâand, lo! he mocks me,â He's gone. (Looking at hour-glass.) The sand is run. 'Tis morning! [Knock. A knock? Come in. Mephis. (outside). 'Tis I. Faust. Come in. Mephis. Thrice must thou speak the words. Faust. Come in, then. [Enter Mephis. Mephis. Good morning, Doctor. We shall soon clasp hands As the best friends in all the world. What think you of my transformation? I come as squire of high degree, With tall cock's feather in my hat. Your pedlar with my wishing-boxâCome, choose! Light, life, and laughter, the gay living world. Faust. Such worldly lot as thou dost offer Can never satisfy, and canst but pain. That thou desirest most must thou renounce; And then comes death, the one desire fulfilled. Mephis. And yet methinks a lonely man last night, Who raised a certain phial to his lips, Seemed to reflect that second thoughts were best. Faust. If from desperate thoughts My childhood's well-remembered hymn did win me, And the old music, like a spell, brought back Faded remembrances of happier daysâ So do I now curse everything that binds My soul in this accursed den of wretchedness. Curst be all Knowledgeâblasted, root and branch, That rotten tree, whose fruit crumbles to dust! Curst be Hope's balsam and its leprous lees, Which rest like fire upon the shrivelled lip! Curst be the slavish nature that I own, Unbidden guest from my Creator's hands, But on thee, Patience, be my deepest curse! [Chorus of invisible spirits. Chorus. Woe! woe! the beautiful world By the might of thy hand to ruin is hurled; A demi-god strikethâto wreck it is tossed. Weep we and wail we for Beauty that's lostâ Mightiest, proudest one, wisest of men, Build up the beautiful world again. Mephis. Hark, how my little ones do counsel thee; Hark how they lure to pleasure and to action, The lowest company that life affords Would make thee among men, at least a man. Come, Doctor, come! Old age draws near. Death plucks thee by the hood. I offer youth to youâhot, lusty youth! To leap and run, light as the spotted stag! The naughty dancing heart of twenty-one Shall buffet at your ribs!âWhat say you, Doctor? Faust. You offer me a gift beyond all price! What, in return, do you demand from me? Mephis. Oh, a mere trifle; that's an after question. Faust. In the Devil's charity I've little faith. Out with your termsâwhat is the price you ask? Mephis. I'll not insult your grave sagacity To make pretence that I do aught for pity. To you I'll bind myself, to be your slave, To do your bidding, serve you promptly, featly, And, when we meet togetherâyonderâyou, Both soul and body shall be mine. Faust. That yonder place gives me but small concernâ Your wager I accept! Mephis. Think wellâI shan't forget. Faust. I have thought wellâ When I confess that I am happy, fiend, And ask a joyous hour to linger with me, Your service then be endedâI am forfeit. Mephis. Done! Faust. Then done! Mephis. Clench we at once the bargain. [Listening.] Hark! A pupil in the passage there. Faust. I cannot see him. Mephis. The poor lad has been waiting a long timeâ Put on your travelling gear, 'tis waiting thereâ Give me your cap and gown. I'll not discredit you. Trust to my wits; I rather like the whim; [Puts on cap and gown. This masquerade becomes me charmingly. Faust. Make brief thy mummery. [Exit. Mephis. Aye, so go on, reason and knowledge scorn, And soon you will be ripe unto the plucking! Mine thou shalt be, and mine thou shalt remain. Student knocks twiceâno answerâpeeps in, and enters. Student. Great master, hail! I have just arrived in town, And have with much enthusiasm come To hear the voice of such a mighty scholar. Mephis. Indeed! you flatter meâa simple man. Student. My mother scarce would give consent, She would have kept me half-informed at home; But I love learning, and was resolute, And came for knowledge and for schooling here. Mephis. I fear you should have sought some better teacher. Which of the faculties, sir, would you choose? Student. I would be a logician, as a base For legal study and deep metaphysics, The which I quite adore! Mephis. Make good use of your time, for fast time flies:â Therefore begin with discipline and method. Logic, young friend, is a divided rule, By which you measure everything you say.â You speak. Good. Nothing follows from your words: It therefore follows that you've nothing said. All nature is analysis and synthesis, The esoteric and the exoteric method. âThe first was so, the second so; Therefore the third and fourth are so; If first and second were not, then The third and fourth had never been.â Student. I don't entirely comprehend. Mephis. Indeed! Student. It seems as if the room turned round and round. Mephis. No matter! Next time you'll get better. Student. Theology, I'd almost like to studyâ Or Medicine, master, what think you of that? Mephis. [Aside]. This nonsense bores me.âI'll frisk my cloven foot. [Aloud. The principles of Medicine are most easy. Nature, Man, study all things, great and smallâ Then leave them at the lastâjust as God will. A medical degree is most important: On your imposture stick the genuine label, And there's no need of skill.âDose 'em to death! It is not needful that you have much science; But study above all things female nature. With air respectful, tender, fatherly, And some endearing, reassuring name, âMy dear,â âmy child,â âmy lamb,â âand how are we?ââ You hold the little pulse with gentle pressure, Play with the little hand, till palm meets palm, Sit close, and closer on the couch, to hear, How beats the timid fluttering little heart, To feel the waist be not too tightly laced. Student. Ah, doctor! I can understand you well, I think that is the faculty for me. Good doctor! would you honour my poor book By just one line of writing? Mephis. Most willingly! [Writes. Student [Reading]. âYe shall be as God, knowing good and evil.â [Pauses puzzled, repeats text,âKnowing good and evil, ye shall be,â &amp;c. Mephis. Eritis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum. Student. Ah! [Slowly exits backwards gazing at Mephistopheles. Mephis. Eden's old serpent, he was knavish wise. Be that your maxim, every stair you climb Of knowledge, which ascendeth to the gods, Your steps shall sure be dogged by pale repentance. Re-enter Faust. Faust. Now whither shall we go? How shall I bear me? Shy and old-fashioned am Iâout of date. Mephis. A brief receipt I giveâthe much in littleâ Be self-possessedâthat's the whole art of living. Faust. Let us speed forth at once. Mephis. A moment. There's a form yet unfulfill'd. Oblige me with your signature to this. Faust. Dost thou not trust me? Mephis. Well, Doctor, noâ I've had some trifling practice in these matters. And there's a tendency in such small mortgagesâ You'd scarce believe it, thoughâto cheat the Devil. Faust. How wilt thou have me sign? Shall I engrave it upon brass, Or carve it out in everlasting marble? Mephis. A waste of eloquenceâa scrap will do. Sign with a drop of blood. Faust. My blood! whatever you may please. [Baring his arm. Mephis. [Touching his arm with his dagger.] Blood is a juice of curious quality. Sign there. Faust [Signs]. Then, there! Mephis. Mine! Within the hour thy lips shall taste That wondrous miracle of witches' skillâthe draught of youth! From these old ashes of your body, doctor, Shall rise a bright young PhÅnix all new plumed. This cloak of mine shall be our magic car To waft us o'er the plains like two black eagles. Welcome, my friend, to this new life! A pleasant change! I wish you joy of it. [They disappear. Thunder. Scene 2. âNuremberg. Evening. Lorenz Platz. Organ from church. Townspeople, young and old, soldiers, monks, &amp;c. &amp;c.âsome entering church. Dritter, meeting Zweiter. Dritter. Good morrow, friend. Zweiter. Good morrow. Dritter. Well, what think you now of our new Burgomaster? Art more content with him? Zweiter. Content! Why should I be? The rates and taxes rise from day to day. Dritter. Aye, true. This never-ending war is like a sieveâ We pour our taxes in, it never fills. Zweiter. Aye, and I'll pay, whilst bloodshed comes not nigh us. So long as war keeps at respectful distance, I give them leave to slit each other's throats. Let us have peace at home; that's all I ask for. [They enter church. [Laughter without. Enter Frosch, Altmayer, Brander, and Siebel from tavern; followed by hostess. Frosch [Singing]. Fly away, fly away, Lady nightingale, Over the mountain and over the dale! Fly to my sweetheart out over the sea, And greet her a thousand times for me. Siebel. Nay, greet my sweetheart not! I tell you I'll resent it. Frosch. My sweetheart greet and kiss! I dare you to prevent it. Chorus. Draw the latch! The darkness makes. Draw the latch! The lover wakes. Shut the latch! The morning breaks. Siebel. Yes, sing away, sing on, and praise and brag of her! I'll wait my proper time. I'll laugh anon. Me by the nose she led; she'll soon lead you. [Laughter and clinking of glasses. Enter Mephistopheles and Faust. Mephis. Here is another foretaste of the world you've entered on, The joyous rollick of these gentlemen. Free rout and shoutâeach vie in making noise, And very little wit goes very far. [A hush among all. [Aloud]Good morrow, gentlemen. Frosch [Aside]. A saucy scarecrow. [Aloud] Sir, you have travell'd, I dare swear, And seen some curious things, but have you met Since your arrival here, with our town fool? Mephis. We passed him in the street, not long ago; He sent a greeting to his cousin Frosch. [Bows to Frosch. Frosch. [Aside]. He knows my name. Altmayer [Aside]. He had you there. Frosch. Sir, do you stare at me? Mephis. But admirationâadmiration, sir! Siebel [Aside]. I'll smoke himâI'll draw him outâ [To Mephis.]A paunch is weariness and dole, my master, If I might ask;âhow did you get so lean? Mephis. Fasting, and piety, and wholesome liquor: [Taking wine from hostess. It is such trash as this has blown you out. Siebel. Unless you give us better, sirâhang itâ Your manners are but scurvy. Mephis. And your wines are but execrable. But that I fear to anger our good host, I'd have us drink some choicer wine together. Siebel. I'll answer for our hostâproduce the wine; Is it in cask, or bottle? I can't see it. Mephis. But soon you shall. Where will ye have it from? The barrel, chairs, or table? Altmayer. Oh, you don't know us, if you think we'll brook Such banter from a stranger. Mephis. Eh? Ha, ha! I would not banter such distinguished company. Bring me a gimlet here. Brander. Here in the tool chest, we'll find that. Frosch [Aside]. A gimlet! hang him, let us try him! [Brings tool chest from tavern door. Brander. Here is the tool chest. Mephis. Good! and here's the gimlet. Some wax for stoppersâquick! we want that. Brander. Here's wax! here's wax in plenty. Siebel. Pshaw! a juggler's trick. Mephis. Now, gentlemen, the choice is free; make up your minds. You, noble sir, begin. Siebel. Eh? go to the Devil. Mephis. Will you try his tap? Come, name your wineâ [Boring table. Good Rhenish? Siebel. Good rotten eggs! Mephis. And you, sirâyour choice? [Boring. Altmayer [Aside]. Humour him. Frosch. Well, if this table be your cask, good Rhenish, sir, for me. Mephis. And you, sir? Altmayer. Me? oh, something sweet and rare. Mephis [Boring]. Tokay! It shall be of the best. Mephis. And lastly, you, sir. What wine for you? [Boring. Brander. For me, Oh, anything! whatever I can get. Mephis. You're easy satisfied. [With gestures. Wine is juice and wood the vine, Bacchus is the lord of wine, Drink with faith, nor pause to puzzle, Here is wine in plentyâguzzle. Every man withdraw the stopper, And drink such wine as he thinks proper. [As each draws stopper, wine runs into glass. Frosch. [Holding up glass]. Look there! Siebel. Look there! Brander. It looks like wine! Mephis. Smell it! there's bouquet for a prince! Siebel [Drinking]. 'Tis Rhenishâsuperb Rhenish! Frosch [Drinking]. Glorious Rhenish! Siebel. It is a miracle from heaven or hell! Mephis. Drink! but be cautious not to spill. There's danger in a drop that falls. All [Singing]. That we will! That we will! Like five hundred swine we swill. [They drink repeatedly. Mephis. [To Faust.] Look at them now; the happiest of men. Faust. Come, let us go. Mephis. Nay, wait; wait till you see them in their glory. Siebel [Singing]. Like five hundred swine we swill. [Drinking carelessly, spills wine on ground, which turns to flame. Hollo! hollo! we're drinking fire. Mephis. [Aside]. Down friendly element! be still. [Aloud]Only a little purgatorial flame. [Flame dies away. Exit Faust. Altmayer. What does the fellow say? Siebel. Better take care. Frosch. No tricks with us, sir. Siebel. Don't you play your hocus-pocus here. Mephis. Silence, old wine-tub! Siebel. Wine-tub! Altmayer. Let's have some more. [Draws spiggot, fire shoots out towards him. Ten thousand devils! help! I'm burning, burning! All. Kill him! he's a wizard. Kill him! kill him! [They draw their knives and rush at Mephisto. Mephis. [With gestures.] False pictures form in air, Change place, sense ensnare, Shift here, shift there. [They stand petrified. Frosch. Where am I? what strange land is this? Altmayer. What vineyards, too! Siebel. And seeâgrapes cluster to my hand. Altmayer. What leafy bowers! What a bunch! [He holds Siebel by the nose. They draw their knives as if to cut down bunches. Mephis. [With gestures.] Error cease, you have awoke; Mark, how the devil cracks a joke. [Mephisto disappears. Siebel. What is it? Brander. What? Frosch. Was that your face? Brander. And this, your purple nose, I pulled for grapes? Altmayer. My head is swimming. Siebel. My inside is a-fire. Altmayer. And mine. Brander. And mine. Frosch. What is the matter with you all? Siebel. Where is the juggler gone? He'll smart for this, if he meets me. [Church clock strikes. Organ. Is the wine running still? Frosch. Eh? Wine! No. 'Twas all a cheat. Altmayer. I'm sure I tasted wine. Brander. And I'm sure I saw grapes. Siebel. I thought I saw them, tooâbig purple bunches. Altmayer. Well, miracles have ceased; No wonders after this. [Exeunt, confusedly talking to one another. People come out of church. Re-enter Faust. Faust. My yoke-fellow is gone, who measures me by his own brutish tastes. Enter Margaret, dogged by Mephistopheles. Faust. What angel walks the street! Pretty lady, pray accept my escort; I fain would guard thee home. Mar. Sir, I am not pretty, nor yet a lady; I have no need of any escort home. [Exit quickly. Faust. The air is chiming with her words! Mephis. Eh, doctor? What? You're on the scent? Faust. Saw you that lovely maid who passed but now? Mephis. A creature with pale eyes and yellow hair? Faust. The same. Mephis. Sweet saint, she's just returned from her confessor, Who gave her, with a smile, full absolution. Poor creature, she had nothing to confess. I have no power over her. Faust. Had I but two short hours at the task, Trust me, I should not ask the devil's aid To win a simple maiden to my hand. Mephis. Spoken like an old French rake, who has no faith In any female virtue 'neath the sun. Faust. Since you and I have been companions You've led me a dull round of feverish revelry and hollow pleasure. Now, when I've found a spring In the dry desertâand I seek to drinkâ You hold me backâand you deny me. Mephis. Be calm, my friend, be calm! The girl is yours. Faust. Fetch me her kerchief, or some withered flowersâ Something her hand hath touched. Mephis. I will do better,âfor within the hour I'll give you entrance to her maiden chamber, And you shall breathe its fragrant atmosphere, And contemplate the happiness to come. Faust. Fetch me some lustrous present to enchant her! Mephis. Ah! presents already! That's the planâthat's the way to woman's heart. Be she a saint, be she a Magdalen, A dangling diamond makes her simplyâwoman. Faust. Where is her home? Mephis. Yonder! Its windows peep through jessamineâ You'll enter through the garden at the back. Faust. Ah, fairest one! my soul doth follow thee. [Exit after Margaret. Mephis. So prone are mortals to their own damnation It seems as if the Devil's use were gone! [Bells peal out. Monks enter from church. End of Prologue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âNuremberg. Margaret's Chamber. Twilight. Enter Mephistopheles and Faust. Mephis. Come in, tread softly; this is the dove's nest. Faust. Leave me. Mephis. I will. None shall disturb thy saintly vigil. My spell is on the house till I come back; [Looking round the room]Humph! It is not every girl keeps things so neat. [Exit. Faust. Sweet holy twilight, welcome! 'Tis the shrine And sanctuary of spotless girlhood. What peace and order! What calm content reigns all around her chamber! In this neat poverty there is a wealth, In this small room, a maiden majesty! Dear hand, which leaves its charm on these dull things, And lends this lowly home the light of heaven. Enter Mephistopheles. Mephis. Quick, quick, she's coming to the door. Faust. Aye, hence, and never more will I return! Mephis. Why, what a virtuous outburst!â Here is the casket which I've brought. Faust. Brought what? Mephis. Some toasted cheese to catch a little mouse. Quick, place it in the trapâpale pearls, bright diamonds. I've been to fetch 'emâfromâelsewhere. Faust. I know not. Shall I? Mephis. Oh, shall you? Would you keep the trash yourself? I hope you are not growing avaricious! [Puts casket in press. Faust. She's here! Mephis. Come, come away. Aye, child is child, and play is play. [Exeunt. Enter Margaret with lamp. Mar. It seems so close, so sultry here, yet in the garden The air was chilly. [Opens window.] I feel strange and nervous. 'Tis mine own chamberâwhat should frighten me? [Goes to a little statue of Virgin, and crosses herself. From all things evil, holy mother, guard me!â Why do I still keep thinking, thinking, thinking? He was so handsome, manly, confident. His boldness had a charm, a grace in it, That proved distinction. But when I checked him, in an angry tone, How he submitted, with a silent bow, And with an air respectful and yet sad. I might have answered him with gentleness, And so have spared myself from this regret. He is a strangerâwe'll not meet again. Heigh ho! I know not why, but I feel sad. [Singing. âThere was a king in ThulÃ©, Was faithful to the grave; To whom his dying true-love A golden goblet gave. And when his days were ending, His township o'er he told, Gave all to his successorsâ Gave not a cup of gold. Aloft at the regal banquet, Among his knights sat he, All in the halls of his fathers In the castle by the sea.â [Opens the press to put away things, and discovers the casket. What's here! An inlaid casket! I'm sure I locked the press. It must be fancy. Nay! a beauteous casket: I feel it, it is real! Why, how could it come here? Sure such a shell must hide some lovely kernel; And see! a ribbon, and a little key. I'm trembling at the thought of opening it. Yet I must take a peep. Would that be wrong? If I do not I shall die of curiosity. Heavens, what a blaze! Oh!âoh!ânever, never have I seen trinkets and jewels like to these! [Mephistopheles peeps in. They are quite wonderful! Those pearls of moonlight, and those starry diamonds! I wonder how this chain would look on me. Mephis [Aside]. She takes the baitâall women are alike! Mar. I almost feel afraid to touch it! Oh, beautiful! how beautiful! The earrings, too! oh, if they were but mine! Whose can they be? they'd grace a duchess or a queen. How do I look; I wonder? Mephis [Aside]. Bewitching! The best card in all my hand. [Exit. Mar. How strange they make one! They give one quite a different air. A thought! perhaps 'twas heâ That noble heâwho left them here! I feel my head half wild with pride and pleasure. No, no, he cannot think of a poor girl like me! I wonder shall we ever meet again? I wonder will my happy simple life Ever grow dreamful and disturbed? Scene 2. âNuremberg. The City Wall. Enter Faust. Faust. But once I saw her, 'twas a passing glimpse, And yet the whole infection of her beauty Hath passed into my blood, and left a fever. Are our emotions but the toy and sport Of every change of scene and waft of air? Enter Mephistopheles. Mephis. Now by the purgatorial flames! By Hell! I would I could invent some feller curse! Faust. Why, what's the matter? Mephis. If I were not the Devil, I would cry, âThe Devil take me, if I suffer it!â Faust. What is the cause of this Satanic anger? Mephis. A weasel monk has come and sucked the eggs. The jewels that I've found for Margaret He hath empocketed for Mother Church, A morsel for her most insatiate maw. Faust. What do you mean? Mephis. Her mother found poor Margaret in her finery; (And how she got an inkling, I can't tell, The nose that woman hath is past belief,) And finding something cursed in the trinkets, She straight devotes them unto Mother Church. âShe,â quoth the monk, âhath a good stomach, She can eat up all, and never, never over-eat herself.â Faust. And Margaret? Mephis. Wellâshe didn't look religious. She wept awhile, and to the monk was deaf; Who praised her for her meek self sacrifice. And now she's sighing, thinking of the giver, And wond'ring if she'll ever see him more. Faust. Then bring me to her. Mephis. I'll watch that greedy monkâa fat-paunch'd monk. Faust. Your plan? Mephis. A very simple one. I go at once to visit old dame Schwerdtlein, The confidential neighbour of our Margaret. This eve the two will have a pleasant gossip Touching the casket, and the handsome stranger, When I'll drop inâa messenger from far, To bring the smug grass-widow cheerful news. And then to gain a footing in the house, Say that her husband died in Padua. Faust. And thenâ Mephis. Then slyly add, I am a bachelor, And gain the gentle widow's confidence. Good soul, she'll need another witness, though. Faust. What witness? Mephis. You. Faust. I cannot go to Padua. Mephis. Sancta simplicitas! there is no need. Can you not say you saw the corpse? that's all. Faust. Then I refuse! Mephis. O holy man, that would outwit the devil! Is it the first time that the learned reverend Hath sworn to what he knew could not be true? Have you not taught theology and science, Matters, in truth, you knew as little of, As now you do, of poor old Schwerdtlein's death? Faust. But threadbare sophistry! I will not meet her. Mephis. Who forces thee? Then do not meet her. Was I not with your worship's strict command, To get you opportunity?âAh well! Let's hence, for there be other sirens in the sea. Come, doctor, flee temptation. Ahâyou linger? Faust. [Aside.] How he doth cast a hellish light On what a moment since seemed sweet as flowers! (Aloud)Go on. Mephis. Well, then, I pay my court to mistress Martha, A jaunty, thriving suitor, fallen in years; (No vows, no honeyed speech, no upturned eyes, Nothing, God knows, to spoil the widow's peace,) And in a trice his worship will appear, The wolfâthe rakeâto turn the lambkin's head, And take his fill of love, andâperjury. Faust (aside). To see her faceâto feel its gaze on meâ To hear her voiceâher voice! (Aloud)Come, lead me to herâlet me blindly meet her. [Exit. Mephis. The profligate! he'd keep behind the mask, He would sip passion with a parching throat, And, as he yieldeth, to his tempting heart He calls me his betrayer. Alas! poor Satan! how you're daily wronged! Happy you have a shoulder that can bear it, Or else in time you'd grow a thing to pity. [Exit. Scene 3. âNuremberg. Martha's Cottage. Martha, working. Martha. This day, six years ago, my husband left me, Homeless and penniless, a poor lone woman. I wish I could cease thinking of him; Forsooth, he treated me most scurvily; And not a sign or token has he sent, To let me know if he be still alive. I cannot tell if I'm a wife or widow. I should be happy, could I only find Certificate of his death and burial; Should he return, poor man,âthe Lord forbid it!â He'd quickly drink and dice away my chattels. Enter Margaret. Ah, Margaret? welcome, welcome, pretty pet! Mar. Oh, Martha dear, I have so much to tell you. See how I tremble,âI can scarcely stand. Martha. Sit down, sit down; be calm, and tell me all. Mar. Last evening, when I looked within my press, What think you that I found? Martha. A love-letter. Mar. A lovely casket filled with costly gems! Martha. From that noble gentleman you spoke of. I said that he was rich! Mar. You think 'twas he? I've dared to think the same. But, Martha, I have yet to tell the end; I was in such a silly ecstasy, I put the jewels on before the glass; I scarcely knew myselfâI sang, I laughed, When suddenly I heard my mother's voice. I nearly fainted, not a word I spake. Martha. Ah! then your mother took them; do not fret, Where they came from there are lots more behind. Mar. But only hear. To-day I found Another box, of ebon wood, just where the other layâ Martha. Another box? Mar. Brimful of jewels, richer than the first. Martha. You must not let your mother know of this, Or she will take them all. Mar. [Showing jewels.] Look here, look here! Martha. You lucky little creature! Mar. And yet I could not go to market, Martha, Or to church, decked out in gems like Martha. Oh, I'll invent something. You can slip over here from day to day, And put them on, and wear them one by one; On holidays, or at a dance, the brooch, The diamond necklace, or the earrings. Mar. How beautiful they are! You think he cares for me? Martha. The surest measure that I know of love, Is by the value of the gift, my pet. Mar. [frightened.] Hark! hark! my mother! [Knock at door. Martha goes to open it. Mephistopheles peeps in through lattice and enters. Mephis. Pardon my coming unceremoniously. [He steps back respectfully on seeing Margaret, and bows. It is Dame Martha Schwerdtlein whom I seek. Martha. Your servant, sir. You startled me at first. Mephis. I have a message for you, but 'twill keep. I'll come again, when you are more at leisure. You have, I see, a guest of consequence. Martha. The funniest thing I ever knew. I can but laugh. He takes you for a lady, dear. Mar. These jewels are not mine. You mock me, sir. Mephis. Ah! brighter gems are yoursâyour air! your grace! Martha. Now, sir, your news; I am all earsâNews from abroad? Mephis. Precisely, you have guessed it. Madam, your husband's dead, and sends his love. Martha. My husband dead! The faithful creatureâmy husband dead! Let me die too! Mar. Ah! how I pity you! be comforted. Mephis. Hear the unhappy story to the end. You are a widow, madamâ Most charming, independent state in life. Martha. Pray tell me how he died, and where, sweet sir? Mephis. His wine-swoln body sleeps in Padua, In all the odour of sobriety, And in a grave selected well, for cool, and comfortable rest. Martha. And have you nothing more to bring me, sir? Mephis. I haveâa prayer; a message from the sainted dead, That you provide three hundred masses for him. Martha. Three hundred masses! how am I to pay? What, has he sent me nothingânot a trinket? Some trifling gift to touch a body's heart. Mephis. Well, to his credit, I must tell you, madam, He parted in a most repentant state; Much did he sorrow for his wickedness,â Though his bad luck at dice grieved him much more. Martha. Oh, sir! fie, fie! Mar. [Aside]. Nay, be more gentle with her,â'twas her husband. Mephis. Ah, lovely lady, how compassionate! [Aside.]What could I wish you but a gallant husband. Mar. I do not think of that; spare me your wish. Mephis. Well, till the husband comeâsome gallant loverâ To fondle, and caress, and call your own. Mar. The custom of our country is not so. Mephis. Custom or not, it happens, though. Martha. Now, sir, I'm calm, go on. Mephis. Good madam, I, myself, was by his bed, And sure he made a very Christian ending. âI should die happy,â the old sinner cried, âCould I but know my Martha had forgiven me.â Martha [Weeping]. Dear heartâwhy I forgave him long ago. Mephis. âYet she, God knows,â said he, âwas more to blame than I; Her tongue was wagging, morning, noon, and night.â Martha. Oh, what a lie!âand almost in his coffin. What, did the wretch forget he owed me all? Mephis. âOnce,â said he, âleaving Malta, I did pray A blessing on my wife, and heaven rewarded me. We robbed the Sultan's galley of a treasure, And I received a handsome share of booty.â Martha. What, think you, sir, he buried it? Mephis. Buried it? No; his heart was far too sordid. Strolling through Naples, a most gorgeous damsel Took pity on his loneliness and pelf, And spent it for him in a week or two. Martha. Wretch! This report kills all my love for him. Mar. Sir, sir, you are, indeed, too cruel. Mephis. Madam, take my advice as from a friend. Mourn one chaste year, and meanwhile look about For a good, well-conditioned second spouse. Martha. Alack, alack, such an ungrateful wretch Gives small encouragement to try again. Mephis. Ah! had he known what a fond wife he had!â Treat me as well, and, madam, I protest I'd ask you on the moment to change rings. Martha. Oh, sir! Mephis. Oh, dame! [Aside]. I'd best be off, or she may take the devil at his word. Mar. [Aside]. He mocks you, neighbour. Martha [Aside]. Nay, nay, I think the gentleman is most polite. Mephis. Ladies, farewell. Martha. Stay, stay, sir, one word more; I'd like to have some proofâ Some witness or certificateâto show That my poor man is really dead and buried. Mephis. [Aside]. An eye to business. Martha. That would comfort me. Mephis. Well thought; a witness I expect in town, A friend of mine, a noble gentleman. Martha. Ah! Most important! Mephis. I'll bring him here. Martha. This evening, pray do. Mephis. And this young lady, shall we find her hereâ A gay young gallant, a great traveller. Mar. I'd be abashed before him, sir. Mephis. You, lady? Not before an emperor. Martha. The garden then, behind the houseâ We shall expect both gentlemen This evening. Farewell till then. Mephis. Ladies, farewell. Martha. A courtly gentleman, and so polite. This evening, pet, you'll not forget? Give me the jewels, dear; I will take care of them. Your mother sha'n't have these. [Exeunt. Scene 4. NurembergâMartha's Garden. Faust and Margaret. Mephistopheles and Martha. Mar. You put me to the blush. My simple speech cannot attract a man Who knows the world so well. And it must be that thou hast flocks of friends, Wise, sensible, with whom I can't compare. Faust. Thou precious one, in all thy humbleness; More wise by far thy sweet simplicity. [Faust kisses her hand. Mar. Ah, no, sir, no, how can you kiss it,â It is so coarse, so hard. Faust. One glance from thee, one word delights me more, Than all the boasted wisdom of the world. [Exeunt. Enter Mephistopheles and Martha. Martha. And you have been a traveller all your life? Mephis. For ever, madam, up and down the world, Yet all my instincts are domestic, madam. Martha. Whilst one is young, I well can understand A roving life unfetter'd by a family; But for a sad old homeless bachelor, Without a soul to nurse, or care for him, That seems to me a shocking state of things! Mephis. I shudder, madam, when I think of it. Martha. Why, then be warned in time, before 'tis late. Mephis. There is one obstacle that holds me back. Martha. And that? Mephis. My modesty. Martha. Ah, sir, you'll find a woman always ready To comfort and encourage a shy lover, And almost make for him his declaration. Mephis. Dear madam, you encourage me so kindly. You have a comfortable little home? Martha. And you, no doubt, a handsome income, sir? Mephis. Oh, plenty, thank you. We are getting on. [Exeunt. Enter Faust and Margaret. Mar. A moment wilt thou give to thought of me, I shall have time enough to think of thee. Faust. And art thou much alone? Mar. Alone I ever am. We have a little home and pretty garden Which father left us when he died; And so we are not poor. But mother is so saving and so anxious, That all the household work must fall on me. We have no maidâso I am ever knitting, Sewing and cookingânot that I complain, But we might live as easy as our neighboursâ Indeed, I have no time except to think. Faust. Hast thou no sistersâbrothers? Mar. I have one brotherâhe's so fond of me. He is a soldier.âI had a baby sister, But she is deadâand now when I remember The world of sleepless trouble 'twas to me, I feel how I could welcome twice the pain To have its dimpled cheek again to kiss, I loved the darling so.â Faust. An angel sweet, if it resembled thee. Mar. I reared it from its birthâIt seemed to love me, For 'twas the same as motherlessâso ill Our mother lay. She could not give it suck, Or tend itâso its precious little life Was in my hands, half care and half delight. At night, its cradle stood beside my bed, And I would wake in fright if it should turn, Or toss in feverish sleepâI still was anxious, Even in my dreams.âSometimes a crying fit Would seize itâthen I needs must start from bed, And soothing lift the little wailing mite, And up and down the bedroom, rocking it Softly within my arms and crooning to it, Hush it to sleep again. Then with broken rest I yet must rise when birds begin to chirp, And be at workâthe washtub or the market, And all the little household cares again;â You see when one is always on the strain, Though one be young and strong, it is no wonder The spirits sometimes sink. Faust. When thou art absent I'll yet talk to thee, And frame thine answers with a still delight. Ah, you take heart and raise your eyes to meâ The stars beam from those eyelid clouds at last. [Exeunt. Enter Mephistopheles and Martha. Martha. 'Tis hard to change a dry, old bachelor. Mephis. I've been a sad scamp, madam, in my time; And yet folk say âThe scamp makes the best husband.â Martha. And have you never met a lady, sirâ In confidenceâyou never had a fancy? Mephis. It was my ruin: young and old I fancied. Martha. Oh, fye, fye! I wish to say, Have you been ever serious? Mephis. With ladies, madam, 'tis not safe to jest. Martha. I mean, sir, have you ever had a liking? Mephis. The favour shown me everywhere is great. Martha. Ah, sir, your heart is good, but you are simple. I mean, you ought to marry. Mephis. What, a widow? Martha. Sir! Mephis. A widow has one charmâshe knows so much. [Exeunt. Enter Faust and Margaret. Mar. And yet too soonâtoo soon. I know thee not. Faust. Ah! do you doubt me? Mar. If you had known me, even for a year, I'd think, yes, he may love me for myself; But nowâ Faust. You think, mayhap, because the time is short Since we have met, that I may partly feign. The time doth fail, and words are faint and bloodless, To show thee my bright ecstasy withinâ The new-born planet of my endless love! Mar. My heart is fullâtears comeâI know not why. To-night is like the first day spent in heavenâ All peace, all trust, and yet all wonderment. I had no warning of this happinessâ The blessed Virgin sent no dream to meâ And now I am so joyed. Dost love me so? Faust. Thou art the only light that ever shone Across my path of lifeâMy firstâlast idol! Mar. Dost love me so, indeed! Stay, I will prove it. [She plucks a daisy, and begins to pull the petals. Faust. What dost thou with the flower? Mar. You'll only laugh at me; goâgo. Faust. What are you murmuring so sweetly there? Mar. He loves meâhe loves me not. Faust. I guess, sweet love! Mar. Loves meâloves me not; loves meâloves me not. He loves me! Faust. Yes, child, and let this little flower speak, As if a spirit whisper'd in thine earââHe loves me.â Dost know the meaning of those words, âHe loves me?â Mar. I trembleâlet me be silent. [She suddenly presses his hand convulsively, then exits hurriedly. He stands for a moment in thought, then follows her. Enter Mephistopheles and Martha. Martha. I hope, dear sir, that you are not a flirt? Mephis. 'Twould be impossible to flirt with you. Martha. You could not, having won a lady's loveâ Her husband and her parents deadâdesert her. Mephis. A widow and an orphan, madam, never! Martha. Dear man! When my first husband was betrothed to meâ Well I rememberâ'twas a night like thisâ He closed our bargain with aâyou can guessâ Upon the cheek. Mephis. What, with his open hand? Martha. Nay, saucy one, his mouth. Mephis. Hem! Madam, its getting late. Martha. Aye, true, I'd ask you to stay longer, But this is such a place for wicked gossip, And take what heed you may, whate'er you do You are certain to get talked about. Mephis. Aye, madam, true, 'tis a censorious world. Martha. But our young couple, where are they? Mephis. They're flown up yonder path, the naughty love-birds. Martha. He's very fond of her, it seems. Mephis. And she of him, I thinkâthe old story, the old story, madam. [Exit Martha. Where will she go to, by and by, I wonder? I won't have her. Margaret runs in, and hides behind tree. Mar. He's coming! Faust follows, looking for her. Faust. At last! At last I've caught you! Mar. [Clasping him]. I love thee! Oh, thou King of all the World! Mephis. [Peeping in. Aside.] That kiss doth seal thee mine! [Coughs. Faust [Starting]. Who's there? Mephis. A friend! Faust [Mockingly]. A friend! Mephis. Thou King of all the World, 'tis time to go. End of Act I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âTrees and mountains. Faust. Thou glorious nature, thou art kin with me! And passion pales before the boundless calm Of skies and sleepy groves. This freshn'ing breeze, It seems to purify the heart within. And now I am released for a short respite From that dark yokefellow who drags me down; Who, like a bat, fastens upon my soul With hooked and spectral wing, fanning the fire That raged within my breast for Margaret. This mandrake passion, let me tear it up, Although it leave my heart bleeding and racked. Enter Mephistopheles. Mephis. What! vapouring and moralizing here? BecalmÃ¨d in a sudden lull of virtueâ Who can foretell your whim? your nose in air, Smit with divine remorse, you stalk alone; Anon, a sinner, rather commonplace, You pour sweet falsehoods in a maiden's ear, And so all endsâah, well, a common ending. Faust. Why hast thou followed me? Was it our bond That you must thrust your company upon me? Mephis. Oh, I would gladly leave you; A surly, thankless, peevish mate, like you, Is not amusing. At home your Margaret sits, waiting and watching; Longing and longing, the poor monkey cries, âOh, might I be a dove, that I Might fly to him, and nestle near!â Faust. Thou snake! thou snake! Mephis. [Aside] When I trap thee! Faust. I'm true to her, and I am ever near her. I envy even a blessed shrine When touched by her sweet lips. Mephis. Ah! yes! I've often envied you those dainty cherries That you have crushed with such a juicy kiss. Faust. Silent! be silent! Mephis. Doctor, you make a wry face at the dish, While your mouth waters all the while to taste it. Go to your Margaret and dry her tears, Arrange a visit to her home to-night, Give her this little phialâan opiate only To make the dragon sleepâher starched old motherâ (Her brother's at the wars, he can't disturb you,) Put three drops in her posset, and all's well: Take it, thou trembler! take it, there! What were the joy of heaven to her embrace! [Puts bottle in Faust's pouch. Faust. And at what cost?âthe ruin of her life. Shall I, lost soul and the abhorred of God, Sweep down with me to hell this earthly angel? Mephis. Get in, thou moral rake, and dry her tears. Faust. Fiend, thou dost warp my reason, whet my passion, My will and conscience wither at thy sneer. Mine be the penalty, mine the perdition, The doom of both be one for ever! [Exit. Mephis. The devil that despairs, of all poor creatures Is the poorest. Give me the man who will go onâstraightwayâ With a strong willâpig-headed, damnable! [Exit. Scene 2. âNuremberg. Margaret's Garden. Evening. Margaret at her spinning-wheel. Mar. My peace has fled, My heart's like lead, I'll never find rest, Oh! never more. When I have him not, The grave's my lot, The wide world all Is turned to gall. The moon was full when we two walked together, And now it is a crescentâa long month. It's Ah! the hopes, the starts, the coming stepsâ 'Tis never he who comes! My peace has fled, My heart's like lead, I'll never find rest, Oh! never more. Enter Mephistopheles slyly. Mephis. Alone! [Margaret shudders, continues working, and turns away her face. What! quite forlorn for love? Love hath been all too kind to thee at first, Now you begin to learn love's cruelty. Mar. Sir, if I'm free to choose my company, Leave me, I pray you. Mephis. Why, what a thing is prejudice in woman! That for some blemish, or some trick of nature, (Say a poor smile, that fails to fascinate,) Condemns, without a thought, an honest man. Here have I been upon your service, Margaret, I whom you hate, and deem your enemy, Have sought your wandering and gloomy lover, Touched on your pining solitude with feeling, And he is coming full of penitence To kiss your tears away. Kiss hard in turn, That he may not so soon forget your kiss. Mar. I die to see himâ'tis my yearning hope To catch his stepâto hear his voice again; But if he only comes on your persuasion, Oh, let him never come. Mephis. He comes to you because he worships you, And I will teach you how to keep him, too. There is one point of danger in his nature: Avoid all mention of religion to him. Myself, am an exemplary Christian, Yet even I don't venture on these subjects. Mar. [Aside. Stopping her spinning]. Sooth, this man is an enemy to God, With every shuddering instinct I can feel it. Mephis. But if you disobey my counsels, maiden, And talk of the redemption, faith, and prayer, Your happiness will turn to must and blight: Despair, disgrace, and ruin will o'ertake you, Then, should you turn for helpâ [Mephis sees her cross, his eyes fix on it, and he half rises to move away. Mar. [Observing, starts up] If you are evil, and God's enemy, Then let this holy symbol drive thee hence. [She stands up, and lifts cross. He cowers away out of the door, looking devilishly, behind. He's gone! He's gone! It is some fiend disguised. Enter Faust. Faust. Margaret! Mar. My love! my love! [She rushes with a cry to him. Why have you starved my heartâso longâso long? Believe me, one can die of misery. Faust. For your own sake, beloved one, not mine, I have been absentâabsent to shield thy fame. Mar. Thy answer is so kind, and yet so cold, 'Tis meant to comfort, but if frightens me. If thou hast tired of me, ah, do not tell me, For I would still deceive myself awhile Till I be used to doubt. Now doubt is death! Faust. There is a little wail upon thy voice, Which strives not to upbraid, not to complain, Which pains me more than passions of reproach. Mar. If you are yet unchanged I'll dare to speak Words that would choke me, if you loved me not. You say your absence was to shield my fame; There is a better shield than absence, love. Faust. And that? Mar. [Hesitatingly] The name ofâwife. Faust. Wifeâah! dearest! Could I but call thee wife! [Presses her to him. Mar. It is dear life to me to know thy mind. May I implore? I promise not to blame. Faust. We are two months upon a rapid, dearest. Unless the rush of fate or death shall part usâ Mar. Of fate? Then there is something that may part us Which is not death. What is it? Faust. I am not freeâgrant me thy loving patience And perfect trust awhileâa little while. Mar. [Terrified] How long? A weekâa monthâa yearâa life? Till hope decays to doubtâthen mortal surety Kills me by inches. Faust. But trust me, love, I'll tell thee all;âanother timeânot now. [Kisses her. Mar. [With an effort]. Thou talk'st of fate. What dost thou mean? Hast thou no faith in Heaven's helping hand? Faust. Hush, hush, my child! Let it be thy gentle woman's part to pray. I part from thee For a bold act that may redeem us both. Enter Mephistopheles unobserved. Mar. Part from that manâthat demonâpart from him. Before you came he sat there by my side, I felt like a poor bird before a snake, But when I lifted up this sacred cross He shrank away, unmasked, and horrible. He is a devil, and God's enemy! Mephis. [Aside]. Ay, thou shalt cower at the cross, When I am grinning at thy agony! Mar. [Earnestly]. I dreamt he sat with me last night, this friend; I seemed to play with him a game of chance, And for some awful stakeâI shook in sleepâ Sudden it came to me, 'twas for thy soul. Faust [Agitated]. Tell me no more. Mar. He won! he won! Oh, part from him! Faust [To himself in low voice]. Who knows but thou mayst win that stake? [Aloud. Hope all that you desire, and it will hap. Mar. I pray so. You must leave me now. Faust. And must we ever part? Mar. If I were but alone; my mother sleeps so lightly. Faust. Nay, there's no fear. [Shows phial. Mephis. [Aside]. Pretty to see young lovers play with crime. Faust. Put but three drops of this into her cup at evening meal, And it will bring a deep, refreshing sleep. Mar. 'Twould harm her not? Faust. If 'twould, Canst thou believe that I would give it thee? Mar. Ah no! [takes phial] I look upon thy face, and caution's gone. So much already have I done for thee, That now there's scarce aught left for me to do. [Exit. Mephis comes forward. Mephis. Is she gone? Faust. Is it a portion of thy service To play spy? Mephis. She is so interested, doctor, the sly wench, To know if you're religious. Faust. Mocker! thou couldst never understand How this deep loving one, full of her faith, The only shining pledge she has of heaven, Is agonized to think the one she loves Can never meet her there. Mephis. Ha! Thou supersensual sensualist! A very milkmaid leads you by the nose. No matter. Well, to-night. Faust. What meanest thou? Mephis. Oh, nothing, nothing, onlyâto-night. Faust [Turning full on him]. Let what I have to tell stifle thy sneers: I mean to take young Margaret for my wife, To twine her life to mine in holy love. As for thy service, wait until I need it. Mephis. Indeed! So that is your intent? Faust. My changeless purpose. I am resolved to part with her no more. Mephis. Then in good time I'm here. Thou shalt not wed this maid, nor dally with her After this night. Faust. By what pretence canst thou forbid me, fiend? Mephis. Thou answer'st me As if I were some credulous, dull mate. I am a spirit, and I know thy thought. You think you may be fenced round by-and-by With sprinkled holy water, lifted crossâ While you and your pale saint might hold a siege Against the scapegoatâ'gainst the devil here. Ere that should be I'd tear thee limb from limb, Thy blood I'd dash upon the wind like rain, And all the gobbets of thy mangled flesh I'd scatter to the dogs, that none should say This carrion once was Faust! Yon cottage would I snatch up in a whirlwind, At dead midnight, like pebble in a sling, And hurl it leagues away, a crumbled mass, With its crushed quivering tenant under it. Dost know me now? Faust. Fiend, I obey, Mephis. When hell's aroused in me, beware! [Business. End of Act II.</field>

You may believe it every wordâ She's flung herself away at last. Ida. What, Barbara? Bessy. Aye, Barbara. Ida. I cannot think it. Bessy. 'Tis true enough. Why all the town begins to talk of it. Enter Margaret. Girls. Here's Margaret. Bessy. So, Valentine will soon be back again. Well, he should stay at home hereafter. Have you heard any news of Barbara lately? Mar. No, not a word. Bessy. We were just talking of her pretty doings. She has tripped at last. I thought it would be so. Mar. What mean you? [Bessy whispers in her ear. Ah! alas! alas! Bessy. Oh, she's herself to blameâ Such airs and graces! Going with him everywhereâ To village fairs and dances. Serves her right. She took his vows forsooth, and kept his presents, Parading at his side, kissing and courting, And looking down with pride upon her neighbours. Mar. Poor girl! poor girl! I pity her. Bessy. Pity her! Methinks you haven't much to do, then. When we were cooped within and kept at work, There was she ever sporting with her lover. The time, oh, never was too long for them. Well, well, she'll rue it nowâ Now comes the stool and white sheet of repentance. Mar. But surely he will wed her. Bessy. Will he? Wed her? More fool he. A fine young fellowâcan have lots of choice. Besides, he's off to other fields. Mar. Ah! that's not fair. Bessy. Fair! it will go ill with her if he come back. Why, they would tear her garland from her, And scatter chaff before her door. Ida. Hush, hush, be quiet. She loved Barbara, Grief for her mother's death, is load enough to bear. [Distant march. Bessy. Hark! hark! the drums! Our sweethearts back. Girls. I wonder has Fritz come home?âAnd Hans?âAnd Peter? &amp;c., &amp;c. [Exeunt. Mar. How scornful once was I, and how severe When some poor maiden fell. How self-content In my own virtue. Now, alas! I am What I despisedâa living sin. God knows! he seemed so good, and dear, so true. [Places flowers before a shrined image of the Virgin. Night coming on. Oh, holy maiden! Thou who knowest sorrow, Thou through whose anguished heart the sword hath pierced, Incline thy gracious countenance to me. My misery is past my tongue to tell. Thou knowestâthou aloneâwhy sinks within My trembling heart; how terror ever follows My footsteps as my shadow, haunting me; How that I weep the night out sleeplessly. These flowers I bring are watered by my tears. Oh, heal this bleeding heartâoh, rescue me From death and shame! Mother of many sorrows! Have pity, oh, have pityâturn to me! [Returns to house. Citizens, soldiers, &amp;c., cross. Enter Valentine. Val. Home! home again! Ah me! ah me! At drinking bouts, when my companions boasted Of this lass, and of that, I fixed mine elbow Upon the table, and I stroked my beard; Then, with a smile, and the full glass in hand, Each to their taste, said Iâbut show me her Is fit to tie my sister Margaret's shoe. Then, what a clinking! pride of all her sex, She took the prize; but nowâ Now, every rascal thinks he has a right To sneer, and wink, and, worst of all, to pity. [Mephistopheles creeps across. So, like a bankrupt, I must sit and wince, for now, A pest on it! I cannot call them liars. What is this fellow creeping towards me here? If it be he, I'll stretch him dead beneath his mistress' window. [He retires. Enter Faust. Faust. Ever, when I wended to this house, I've seen her little lamp set up to greet me, But now the window's black, and in my heart I feel a blackness too. Re-enter Mephistopheles. Mephis. And I feel like a tom-cat on the tiles That crawls on tiptoe round the chimney-pots. To-morrow is the sabbath of the witches; Walpurgis-night upon the Brocken top. I'll introduce you thereâ'twill cheer you up. Faust. They say her mother's dead. Mephis. There's one old lady less upon the census! Faust [Suddenly]. What was that phial which you gave to make her mother sleep? Mephis. Eh? only a few drops to take her gently off. Faust. What has befallen her? Mephis. Oh, she has only lost her character. Faust. Ah! in what toils of misery I'm entangled. Her mother murder'd, murder'd by me! Mephis. Now that the stars are bright, and the sky clear, I'll sing a serenade to my old sweetheart; Your pretty Margaret's window fronts the garden. [Makes frightful sound on lute. Faust. Cease, cease that hideous noise. [Goes to back of house. Mephis. Hideous! Why, 'tis divine! [Sings]. âOh, Martha, wake! list to your loving wight, Your filmy eyes unclose, My dry-pressed withered rose, And like the downy owl, That wise and patient fowl, Peep from your nest and hoot me a good night. Ho, ho, ho, ho, haw, haw, Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, haw, haw. [Valentine comes forward. Val. What's this infernal bray, old ratcatcher? [Smashes the lute. Mephis. Thou inharmonious bumpkin, Hast thou no music in thy composition? Val. I am a soldier. I only know what wounds a soldier's honour, And how to slit a foul seducer's throat. Faust. The door is fast. Val. Thou coward, draw! Mephis. Draw what?âA cup of ale?â Faust. I know no cause of quarrel, sir, with you! Mephis. If you affect the old dame, don't be jealous. Val. [Furiously to Faust]. Wilt wait until I strike thee? Mephis. Out with your goose-quill, Doctor; Keep by me. Faust. I want no aid. Val. Villains, have at you. [They draw. Mephis. Lunge like fury, Doctor, I will parry. Val. Then parry that. Mephis. Why not? Val. That too. Mephis. Just so. Val. And that, and that, and that. Mephis. With pleasure. Val. I think the Devil fights against me.â My right hand is benumbed. Mephis. Thrust home. Val. O God! Mephis. Ha, ha! Faust. This is murder! Martha [At window]. Help! help! help here! [Ida and Alice have seen part of fight, and have hurried off to give alarm. Mephis. The old one yelps. Show them your heels. Faust. I will not go! Mephis. Fool! do'st know who 'tis? Look in his face. Faust [Alarmed]. Whose face? Mephis. Whose? her brother's. Faust. Her brother! God! Mephis. The hue and cry is up; come, don't stand gaping there. [Exeunt. Enter Ida with Erster, Vierter, and People. Vierter. Ah! here lies one. Erster. A desperate wound; he 'll bleed to death. Run for the guard. Poor lad, poor lad! Vierter. This is a murder! Soldier. Why, let me look. 'Tis Valentine, our comrade Valentine. People. Valentine! Soldier. How is it, comrade. Here, drink this. Vierter. Poor Valentine! He is but now come home. Enter Altmayer and People at various entrances. Altmayer. Why, what's the matter here? Vierter. A poor lad just come from the warsâ Here stabbed to death. The soldier Valentine! Altmayer. What, Valentine! and by his mother's door! Enter from their houses Margaret and Martha. Martha. Oh, my good neighbours, what's the matter? Mar. Who is it that lies here? Erster. Your brother! Mar. My brother! Ah, God helpâit cannotâ[Wildly] Whoâ [Bends, and looks close at the face. He pushes her roughly off. She totters and hides her face on Martha's shoulder. Oh, he will curse me! Val. I'm dying, but of that I reck not now, Come hither, close, to meâI'd speak with you. Mar. He must not die! Oh, let me staunch the blood. Val. Let be, let be! [To Martha] stand thou away from me; To thee I speak. Margaret, thou art but young, And hast not wit enough to push thy trade, For you're a wantonâbe a bold one, then. Mar. Hush, brother! Oh, God! what is't you say? Val. Best leave God's name out of the comedy; What's done, alas! can't be undone, my girl. And now you enter on your new career, And then will flock the flies around the honey! Mar. Spare me! your dreadful words will kill me! Val. The time will come When honest folk will turn from you in horror, And from your tainted presence shrink away. No more in snowy dress before the altar You'll take your stand! No more with maiden pride, In neat lace collar, lead the village dance! But 'neath some shameless roof hide with your kind. Martha. Commend your soul to God, nor slander folk With your last breath. Val. Vile procuress, would I could gripe thy neck, And crush thy wither'd body! For that deed I might have absolution for my sins. Mar. Brother, although thy answer strike me dead, Tell me, who dealt thy wound? Val. Thy lover! [Dies. Mar. Ah! O, God! [Margaret flings up her arms, and falls upon him with a cry. Martha. Lift him within the house. Come, Margaret, love! Mar. Leave me, leave meâto think and pray. [Crowd disperse. Margaret leans against the wall of Martha's house, staring at the ground. Enter Bessy and Catherine. They are told in dumb show what has happened. Alice. Killed by her lover. Bessy. Ah, now you see that she was guilty; Her brother would have slain him for his crime. Alice [To Mar.]. You've got his blood upon you, 'twas your fault. Catherine. How harden'd she appears; she drops her eyes, And dare not look at us. Bessy. Come, we'll go pray For your poor brother's soul, killed by your gentleman. [They pass by, staring insultingly. Ida returns slowly, kisses Margaret, and exits into chapel. Margaret staggers to porch. Mar. [At foot of Virgin and Child.] Oh, thou, who borest pangs the bitterest, Whose heart was pierced, look down on me with pity! [Enters church. Enter Faust and Mephistopheles. Faust. I tell thee, manhood, honour, drag me back! A misery that sickens and appals me, Thou canst regard with a complacent grin. Ah! she's there! she's there! Mephis. You shall not enter! [Seizing him. Faust. Unhand me, fiend! [Mephis thrusts him off, with the following spell. Spell upon thy brain I cast, Fade all memory of the past; Magic mist I spread around, Senseless thou to sight or sound. Sleep secure at my command Till thou wake in witches' land. [A vapour rises and Faust disappears. Now weave the woof of ill begun; Till this woman's soul be won. [Skirts along the house; shrugging his shoulders at the blood. Invisible I'll mingle in her prayers, And tempt her to a future mortal sin. [Enters church. Margaret kneeling, Mephistopheles behind her. Mephis. Margaret, how changed art thou since to the altar Thou cam'st a sinless child. How canst thou pray? A dying brother's curse is in thine ear! Mar. Oh, who but thou canst know my agony? I have no refuge now but thee! [To Virgin. Chorus with organ. Dies irÃ¦, dies illa, Solvet sÅclum in favilla. Mephis. Margaret, dost pray for mercy On thy poor mother's soul to torments gone? Mar. Sorrow and shame encircle me like fire. Within my breast my guilt doth cry aloud. Help, mother of the piercÃ©d heart! Oh, save me From that I fear, the shadow that approaches. Chorus. Judex ergo cum sedebit, Quidquid latet adparebit, Nil inultum remanebit. Mephis. What secret crime hides in thy once pure bosom? What stirs and quickens 'neath thy trembling heart? Destroy all trace of guilt; bury itâhide itâ Or let the rapid river bear it unto the sea. Mar. The massy pillars seem to totter over me! The vaulted arches crush me! Mephis. Hast thou not killed thy mother! Scruple not to kill thy babe! [Margaret shrieks and falls. Chorus. Quid sum miser tunc dicturus, Quem patronem rogaturus, Cum vix justus sit securus. [Darkness. Lonely street. Mephistopheles seen stealing out of the church. End of Act III.</field>

I wish I had a tough he-goat to ride. Hark! to the crashing woods! The affrighted owls are on the wing; Oohoo! Shoohoo! Oohoo! Shoohoo! Cling to my cloakâfear nothing. See The blaze of Mammon stretch'd in tented fires. Bravely illumined is his festal palace. Thou art in luck to-nightâLo! The invited guests approach, a boisterous rabble! Faust. The tempest raves aroundâit dims my sight And fiercely beats on me. Mephis. Hold fastâlest thou be hurled in the abyss. The night with mist is blackâ The forest boughs are at wild wrestle. Hark to the voices, up the wind they come With their mad witching song! Witches in chorus. The witches ride to the Brocken's topâ The stubble is yellow and green the crop. Enter 1st Witch, meeting 2nd Witch. 1st Witch. Which way comest thou hither? 2nd Witch. Over the Ilsen stone; I peeped at the owl in her nest alone. Witches. The way is weary, the way is long, See what a wild and crazy throng. Wizards. We crawl along like a snail in shell, Before us go the womenâbut then, In travelling down the road to hell, We back the women to beat the men. Wizard above. Come on, come on, from Rocky Lake! Both Choruses. The wind is hushed, the stars shoot by, The dreary moon forsakes the sky, The magic notes like spark on spark Drizzle whistling through the dark. 3rd Witch below. Halt there! ho, there! 4th Witch above. Who calls from the rocky cleft below there? Enter 3rd Witch. Oh, take me! I'm full of aches and fears, I'm climbing now three hundred years, I cannot go on, and I cannot stop, And I think I'll never reach the top. Both Choruses. The broom and the branch in the air will float, And a goodly steed is an old buck goat; He who cannot find mount to-night Can never join in the witches' flight. 3rd Witch. I totter alone and stumbleâAlack! In passing they pushed me and pinched me and clawed. At home I cannot find rest for my back, And now I cannot get peace abroad. Both Choruses. Witches' salve is good to cure; A rag will answer for a sail; The trough a goodly ship and sure; They'll never fly who whine and quail. [They settle down. Mephis. What a crowding, pushing, squealing! What a roaring, grinning, screaming! Whirl! leap and chatter! shine and spirt! Give us the true witch element! Where art thou? Faust. (in the distance). Here. Mephis. What, art thou whirled so far away? Am I thy host or lacquey. Clear the way! Faust. Better the airy summit I must own Than is a stew of fire and smoke. They seek the Evil OneâHe is too near! How many riddles, there, might find solution. Mephis. Aye, riddles tangled in a hundred knots, And when untangledâworthless. Let the great world pursue its course, we'll tarry here. Faust. What are the figures yonder doing, As round a gibbet in their filthy rags? Mephis. Heed them not, they brew some hellish mess. Faust. See how they move, with soundless tread, As flit the batsâah, yonder, yonder! Alone and far a girl most pale and fair, With slow and trailing feet she comes to us, Methinksâ'tisâMargaret! Mephis. Illusion! Heed it notâborn of a dream. It is a frenzyâlifeless phantasy. Avoid its stareâ'twill work upon thy blood, Thy brain, 'twill make thee mad. Faust. Those eyes have ne'er been closed by loving hands. Dead!âYet those the lips I once have pressed, That is the form I clasped.â Mephis. Fool, 'tis but magic! Faust. Ah! what means that slender scarlet line Around her throatâno broader than a knife. Margaret!âMargaret! [Thunder. [Sudden darkness. Mephis. The curse of hell upon it! Vanish!

Little sister, so good, Laid my bones in the wood, In the damp moss and clay: Then was I a beautiful bird o' the wood. Fly away! fly away! [Door unlocks. Faust enters with lamp. Faust. O God! and has it come to this, chained in a felon's cell; A criminal without a taint of guilt, [Mephistopheles appears at prison bars. Whose crazy hand hath snatched her infant's life. Mephis. [Who has entered]. She's not the first. Faust. Infinite spirit! who doth hear him mock, Change him into a reptile or a hound! Ah! not the first! Mephis. I love her, soul and body, more than thou. I've thrown a spell of sleep upon her jailers, And we will bear her hence, living or dead. [Exit. Mar. [Counting]. One, two, three,âI have yet five hours to live. Faust [Softly]. Hush! hush! my loveâI come to save thee. Mar. [On her knees]. Headsman, you come too soon. Canst thou not wait till morn? Faust. Dearest, look in my face; thou shalt not die. Dost thou not know me? Mar. Ah, God has sent some friendâyou pity me. I once was fair, and that was my undoing; And I wasâAh, I have forgotten now. Faust. Come, thou art free! Mar. Nay, hold me not with such a cruel grasp. Spare me; what have I ever done to thee? I never saw thy face before. Faust. Seest thou not I amâ Mar. First let me rock my little babe asleep, Or it will cry to part so from its mother. They took away my child to torture me, And now they say I've killed it. Yes, yes. Faust. Oh, Margaret! Margaret! Mar. That was the voice of my lover. Where now is all my pain? I heard his voice. Faust. Margaret, I'm hereâI've come to set you free. Mar. 'Tis thou! 'tis thou! I'm saved. Nay, stay a while, a little while. I love to stay with thee. Faust. Come, come with me. Mar. Hast thou forgotten me? Why feel I now so sad upon thy neck? Thy lips are cold, are deadâI'm Margaret. Ah! thou hast heard my shame; dost Know my crime? [Whispers.] I've killed my mother and killed my babe. And is it thou indeed? Faust. Yes, yes. Mar. And do you take me to your heart again, And do you know who 'tis you are delivering? Faust. Come, come, the morning fades. Mar. Give me thy hand. Mother doth sleep; the sweetbriar, wet with dew, Gives all its heavy sweetness to the night. Oh, welcome; but speak low, she might awake. Give me thy handâthy dear, dear handâoh, God! There's blood upon itâwipe it offâblood, blood! What hast thou done? Faust. Oh! think not of the past. Thy words are death to me. Mar. No, thou must live. To-morrow, I must die. And I must tell thee how to range the graves, And thou must see to it by break of day. [Sits on bed and points to floor. My mother, the best placeânext her my brother: Me well apart, but, dearest, not too far, And by my side my little one shall lie. Faust. Wish you that both of us be lost to-night? Give me your hand, I'll guide you. Mar. Keep to the path up to the wood; Now to the left. See, by the plankâthe pond. Quick, seize it!âsee, it tries to rise. Help! help! Faust. Ay, quick! Come, we will try to save it. Mar. Oh, I could breathe if only past the hill. There sits my mother on a stoneâher eyes Are setâher hand lies dead, and pale, and heavy. Faust. The day is breaking. Mar. Yes, 'tis my last day. Seeânow the gloomy crowdâthey fill the square, They fill the streetsâa thousand upturned facesâ All staring at the scaffold and the block. Ah, dearest, let me see thee, in that crowd. Stretch up thy hands that I may find thy face. Faust. Margaret, thou shalt not die. Recall thy wandering mind. Upon my knees I beg of thee to come, Thy prison doors are open; let us fly. Mar. Where? Out yonder? Faust. Yes, into the free air. Mar. Is the grave out there? Doth death lie in wait? Then come! from here, to eternal rest. I feel death, like a delivering angel Sent straight from God, descending on my heart: Perchance in mercy I might die to-night. Nay, let us kneel and pray that God will strike The chains of sin from our despairing souls Because of our great love and all my sorrow. He may have pity, and may save us both. What shape is that, that rises from the earth? Enter Mephistopheles. 'Tis he! Merciful God, I yield myself to thee. Mephis. Too late! She's judged! [Seizes Margaret. [Voice replies âShe's saved!â Mephis. Hither to me! [Disappears with Faust. [Vision. Curtain.</field>
