      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE This play (written three years ago) is founded on the following passages from Dean Milman's Latin Christianity:- âHenry (the Sixth, Emperor of Germany) appeared in Italy. ... Palermo received him with open gates, with clouds of incense and processions. The youthful William, the second son of Tancred, laid his crown at the feet ofthe Emperor, and received the hereditary Countship of Leece. The campaign began in August; the Enperor celebrated Christmas in Palermo A.D. 1194. There had been no sound of arms, no disturbance, except from the jealousy of the Pisans and Genoese: not a drop of blood had been shed. At Christmas, the period of peace and festivity, Henry laid before a great assembly of the realm letters (it was said forged) but letters which, even if they did not reveal, were declared to reveal, an extensive conspiracy against his power. Bishops, nobles, the royal family, were implicated in the charges. No further evidence was offered or required. Peter de Celano sat as supreme justiciary, a man dear to the hard and ruthless heart of Henry. A judicial massacre began. Archbishops and bishops, counts and noblesâ Margaritone, the great naval captain, the Archbishop of Salernoâwere apprehended, condemned, executed or mutilated with barbarous variety of torture. ... The Queen Sybilla and her three daughters ... were thrown into prison; the young William blinded and mutilated. On the very day when these fatal disclosures were made and the work of blood began, the Empress Constantia Constantia was the legitimate Queen of Sicily, whose rights had been usurped by Tancred, the natural son of one of her brothers. At his death he left his pretensions to his son William and his Queen Sybilla. Henry VI. claimed the throne of Sicily as Constantia's husband. gave birth at Jesi to Frederick Roger, afterwards the Emperor Frederick II. The Nemesis of Grecian tragedy might be imagined as presiding over the birth.ââBook viii. chap. ix. âQui ne met la poÃ©sie au-dessus de tout n'a pas le sentiment de l'histoire mÃªme, car l'histoire est le rÃ©cit des efforts impuissants des hommes pour arriver Ã  cette beautÃ© sÃ©vÃ¨re que nous trouvons dans le grand art.â It is in this spirit that the author has treated the story of this Sicilian insurrection. He does not claim to have reached the severe beauty of art; his endeavour has been rather to touch with sympathy the impotence of human effort. Historical acts have inspired, not dominated him. The Markwald of the drama has nothing in common with the Markwald of history. The office of Peter de Celano is given to Markwald, and in other ways authority is rejected. History and fiction, fact and fable, cross and recross the texture of the plot. Melpone gives her left hand to Clio, her right to the â ... mighty lord and master of the lyre, Unshorn Apollo.â April, 1885.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âRoom in a Sicilian Palace. Enter Veronica and Margarito. Veronica. The Emperor Is then about to land? Margarito. And in his train Are notable Sicilians. Veronica. Ay, indeed! Markwald of Anweiler they say leads home Iolante, our fair countrywoman.âAh! You fret your brow; my words I fear give pain; Before the image of that saint I've marked You're often on your knees. Your idol, sir, Is now but rudely worshipp'd. Margarito. Will that make Me less religious? Veronica. Your audacity Becomes you, Margarito; 'tis the plume Upon your cap. Margarito. I was at Algiers When she consented. So think not, fair dame, I shall be less her gallant when she comes Once more to grace Palermo.âYou will find One worthy of your arts in Henry's train. Oh! he will bring you one step from your throne Who makes all women crouch! Veronica. Celano here? I only love my countrymen, nor those Among them who are leagued to give our land To insufferable Teutons. Margarito. All the same You'll catch him as the plague-spot; he exhales An amorous infection. Henry's self Is sick of him. Veronica. For this I prophesy A pair of Teuton eyes whose northern blue Shall freeze your patriotism. Nay, but here We'll have no noisy politics. I've set Those words to music; will you sing them now? [Taking a lyre. I think it was Sicilia that forgot. Song. If the sun our white headlands with flame Fail'd to greet, Should we deem he would shroud them in shame? Nay; blot The sweet Daylight not;â Heaven forgot. If soft Spring fail'd the flow'rs name by name To entreat, Should we fear she would harden Earth's frame? Her hot Breath sweet Bloweth not;â She forgot. From my love if no gay token came, Were it meet To think she had slighted Love's claim? A knot So sweet Snappeth not;â She forgot. If a land full of memories and fame At the feet Of a tyrant bow'd down should we blame? A spot So sweet Sinneth not;â It forgot. Margarito. Veronica, there's that within your voiceâ You've known no heart-break; it must be a part Of your superb dissimulation, yet You earn this kissâa tribute to your skill. [Taking her hand. A handâoh, it's not white!âa sonneteer Could not express it. 'Tis too exquisite For any use but this. [Kissing it. [Enter Celano.] Veronica [withdrawing her hand]. 'Tis mine to give In hospitality and to assure Frank welcome to my guests. Celano [to Margarito]. Ah! I divine You've been consulting with this lady how Our too time-scanted city can prepare For her great monarch's entry! Veronica. Surely you, Who have put off your native manners, best Can teach the taste of foreigners. Celano. I will, With promptest courtesy. You first must paint These waxen cheeks a German would despise As bloodless. Margarito. This is artifice to bring The balsam-blushes to the lady's face. Celano. In future it must be great Markwald's self, As famed by sea as land in victories, Must loiter in your galleries, and not A sailor of your isle. Margarito. This insolence, Save as enriching us with rainbow change, [Touching Veronica's cheek. From rose to pearl, were scarce deserving note. Lady Veronica cannot forget She is Sicilian,âdoubtless she will give To strangers welcome, be they German churls (Crowds of Apulian captives in their train) Or ... Celano. Have you lover's right for this? Margarito. Now speak, Veronica. Veronica. He simply has the right Of subject to speak honour of his queen. Am I to blame men seek me on their knees, My dear lord councillor? Celano. Superbly urged! [To Margarito.] Now, sir, the hour of public audience Is pass'd, I claim a lover's privacy, My right; the lady has denied it yours. Veronica [to Margarito]. State-business, not Veronica, forbids A further parley. [Exit Margarito. [To Celano.] Now be merciful. Tell me of Andrea. Celano. His sickness wanes. Veronica. If Heaven should restore him ...? Celano. You would add A pray'r I should release him to espouse The girl Veronica, whom he seducedâ The girl who, when a virgin, won the heart Of Peter de Celano:âso I will, On this condition: it be noised abroad How my young brother won your love before You were my bride, and how you forced his mind. Prepare your blushes. Veronica. I will do your will, Beseeching only grace for Andrea. I taught him earthly passion; he is pureâ Celano. As Mother Church could wish; he's penitent Now of his frailty: to the holy nun Who from his fever hath deliver'd him, He's sworn the remnant of his life to pray'r And patient fasting. Veronica. Penitent! Oh then, I do beseech you marry meâ Celano. Not yet. Veronica. O God! It must be false; let me see wordsâ His hand. [Celano gives her a paper. [Reads.] âVeronica, I've found my bride, The Church; 'twas only when you feign'd her voice I loved you.â [She sobs. Celano. Let me counsel! Your one aim Must be to woo the brother in the world, Still unespousedâto-morrow to contract With Madeleine, a fair Thuringian In Iolante's retinue:âand yet I hesitate, for the young Moor Azaire Hath turn'd upon me her black amorous eyes With passion I had best assuage. Veronica. I am Your victim; give me orders; but my name! Have pity on it, if 'twill be your wife's. Celano. Had you as wife betray'd me in this sort!â As it is you'll suffer while I recollect. Veronica! Eyes blue as incensed air, and, oh! I thought As holy; every drop that falls a gem. Pooh! they're to mourn the Church's prisoner! Not the lips!âbut haply he o'erlook'd this brow. I'll think it is Celano's. Keep it smooth. [Kisses her. Exit. Veronica. I'll live for my good name. He only knows My misery, and he will lighten it. Margaritone shall not haunt my house. What said he of a Moorish girl? Can I ... Veronica,âcan he put me to the shame Of suffering a rival; must I wait Till he's worn out a brace of victims, ere I'm safe in all a wife's serenity? My course is clear:â He has ambition, and I'll cover it With the mantle of my grace. We'll rule the world. [Exit. Scene II. âA Room in another Sicilian Palace. Iolante seated before a mirror; Azaire, herself crowned with roses, is wreathing her mistress's hair. Iolante [looking in the mirror]. How well these passionate red roses look Against a skin the ardent sun hath kiss'd Into a shame of darkness! On my white The crimson hearts would pour their rich desire And find it harshly virginal. Swart brows Alone should carry roses. How say'st thou? Azaire. All lovers give them ... Iolante. Ah, you have a love? Is he a Moor or a good Christian soul? Azaire. I may not tell. ... I know not anything. Iolante. You never have been awkward till in love; But Love is blind, so we must give a hand To help his stumbling. What a handkerchief You've tied about your neck!âthe needles sure Stitch'd it with threads of the three heavenly skeins That make a rainbow. You'll outshine the bride. [Enter Madeleine.] All joy and blessing be with you from Heaven. But must a bride Put by the roses of her blood and wear Only the lilies of her spotless flesh? Methinks Azaire Hath stol'n your cheeks to set upon her brow. Madeleine. My bridegroom loves another! Azaire. Let me go To get ... Iolante. There's water in the ewer, child; 'Tis useless for the heart. My Madeleine, One that could cut you to the quick of grief Hath never loved you. Madeleine. But the veil I'll keep For spousal with my Christ. Iolante. O cruelty, Wild beast of vices, sin with claw and tooth, The heart thou holdest is a den, tho' hung With grace as with a vine! Surely in jest You have been wrong'd. Celano comes himself. [Enter Celano and Groomsmen.] Celano. I come for my fair bride. Iolante. You've frightened her. Her lips are trembling as a dove's two wings. Press them to calm with kisses. Celano. They are grey. I'll close thy brown ones with a kisses together, My nightingale! [Kisses Azaire. Iolante. What does this mean? Azaire, Confess that you are guilty. Azaire. Yea, of love. We were fellow-maids together, tho' you kept The Moorish girl well hid. Last night unseen I took a bunch of roses from his hand For Madeleine; he kept mine prisoner, And smiled, âThe roses were a bridal-wreath,â He bade me twist them in my hair, and wait His pleasure till the morrow. Iolante. It is mine That instantly you leave me, traitoress. Celano. Retire in my protection. Mark ye that. Hither, sweet slave. [To Madeleine.] 'Tis not unmannerly To ask for what pertains not to you now. To CÃ¦sar what is CÃ¦sar's, to the bride What is the bride's. Madeleine. And what is God's to God. May I have this veil in which to wed myself To Heaven? Celano. Nay, sister. Madeleine. Then I'll dress your bride. Th' attire is all about me. I shall want No help. I am your humble maid, Azaire. Celano. Less rigorous the service of my bride Than that of Christ's. Madeleine. Her servants must put on Meekness as livery, and this event Shall be the loom on which I'll weave it me, For Christ's sake, [aside] and for yours, Celano, yours. Celano. Delay not then, fair maid, to dress the bride. Madeleine. I had learnt the duties of a wife by rote, The first obedience. With will as meek As he had found in Madeleine his wife, I veil Azaire. Celano. Well spoken! we will wait At the chapel, friends, with your good grace and leave. [Exeunt Celano, Azaire, Madeleine, and others. Iolante. Am I a creature of bed-ridden will To suffer it?âAnd Madeleine is gone!â [Enter Markwald.] Oh, good my lord, great treachery is here. Celano hath but now departed hence With Azaire as his bride, and Madeleine Weeping behind, like Love's new year and old. Markwald. I know Celano's business everywhere, But look not for him here, where I have peace With Iolante. Iolante. But you do not note His sin's enormity. He's broken troth With one as stainless as the marble is, O'er-fountain'd every moment, andâthe shame!â Hath grossly ta'en the Moorish girl. Markwald. In sooth, I like not these alliances of blood At natural enmity;â But you, offend not Peter, for the king Holds him in highest love. He wields the brain O' the monarch; I but execute commands. Loyalty, Iolante! Why this morn My prince hath spoken of a marriage-tie Between my sister Clara and the young Sicilian Margarito.âAh, he comes, My future brother. [Enter Margarito.] Margarito. Trusting here to find The maiden whom the Emperor makes my wife, Your sister Clara. [To Iolante.] Lady, have I leave To rob you of the sweet companionship Of those most grave blue eyes? Markwald. Get her consent, And I will order Clara to appear. The German maids are shy, but true of heart. Believe you, you can trust her. [Exit. Margarito [approaching Iolante]. So we meet. The little missal that you left with me, And those slight rhymes you gave me to re-set, I will return to you. Iolante. Nay, Margarito, they are no love-favours. Think not Clara will be jealous when she sees the holy prayers I tasked you with, or the childish words I prayed you bind into a canzonet. Clara will give the answer to my foolish wonder why love hath wings. Margarito [taking a guitar and singing]. Love's wings are wondrous swift, When hanging feathers lift. Why hath Love wingsâ Great pinions strong of curve? His wild desires to serve; To swoop on the prey, And bear it away, Love hath wings. Love's wings are golden soft, When dropping from aloft. Why hath Love wingsâ Feathers of glistering fleece? To soothe with balmy peace, And warmth of his breath Souls he cherisheth, Love hath wings. Love's wings are broad of van, Stretch'd for great travel's span, Why hath Love wingsâ Mail of the sea-bird's might? From feeble hearts and slight To lift him forlorn To a fastness of scorn, Love hath wings. Iolante. I did not ask for music. Margarito. True; but I Needed it. Iolante. Margarito, I am vex'd To hear you're taking Clara for your wife. Margarito. Oh, I have suffer'd from such nuptial news! Iolante. I fear you're yielding to your monarch's choice. Teutons to licence press their loyalty; But we Sicilians, we should mate for love. Margarito. Have you? Iolante. I was not chosen by the Emperor; Scarcely in secret dare my Markwald woo, Nor had he won the king's consent except For his rare services. Margarito. Oh, I will make Your Clara happy. We Sicilians, We're masters in the art of catching love. The woman is not born I could not make Life-happy with my smile. Veronica, The haughtiest beauty that Palmero boastsâ The silk rustles when I near her. Do you think I'll fail to get the homage of that frank, Little, stolid-hearted Teuton? Iolante. What, you brag? Margaritone, for this haughtiness May Cupid humble you! In turn confess Where pay you homage? Margarito. To my countrymenâ That is, excluding males. You're for the feast The king holds on the day our little prince Must give away his crownâa pretty sightâ For title of a count? You will be there To see this, Iolante? Iolante. How escape? Tis my lord's office to pick up the crown And offer it to Henry; it is mine In all fair ceremonies by his side To stay assenting. Margarito [touching his guitar]. To my music, then! [Enter Markwald and Clara.] Markwald. I've had a task To bring her hither. When you're at the wars You'll leave her safely; she will keep the house. Margarito. And I will keep her heartâa precious charge. ClaraâO eyes blue as the sea I love!â Will you come teach me of Teutonic faith, And give the wild sea-captain a sure port To anchor in, when life's tempestuous? Clara. If you are friendly to my land. Margarito. A fleet At th' Emperor's service is my warranty. If soâwhy then ... Clara. What is the rest, my lord? Margarito. Sweet Clara, thisâthat you must be my wife. Tears! Clara. You're a stranger. Margarito. Dear, of course I am. Would you marry with your brother! Markwald. That's well urged. [To Clara.] Come, come, I'll take you to your sovereign lord, And when you know it is his will you wed, You will not close your fist against the ring. [Exeunt Clara, Markwald, and Margarito. Iolante [looking after Margarito]. Can such a nature pour into a creek? Ay, but it washes the whole world beside. Scene III. âA Terrace. Enter Emperor and Celano. Emperor. 'Tis hot, an air for roses, not for men. What were we saying? Celano. Please you, my good praise, Which made the summer hotter on my cheek. Emperor. True, Peter, you're the apple of our eye; The perfect politician; but this whim Of setting in a Moorish wench's train A lady of our land ... Celano. For discipline; I'd have a wife the Sultan could not match, Amorously dullâno treason. I would sleep On's knee, and dream what beauties I desire; She watching till she snored. Emperor. Well, let us hear Of the Moor's speedy death. Your gallantries Outrage our honest German court. Don't take Your wickedness to church. A monstrous freak, To play the bridegroom to that devil-born Hot-blooded little beauty. Celano. Absolute Your will as my obedience. Emperor. There strikes The hour we granted Markwald. [Exit Celano [to Fool without]. Fool, you here? Fool. Surely when wisdom goes out of door, folly may peep in at window. Celano. Has a fool eyes? Fool. No; coupled with Love, he's blind. Celano. That most melancholy man, the Archbishop, has found you gamesome. Fool. I feed on him, he's victuals to me; he's so desperate a man, and a prideâoh, but I'd live to drive the waggon, with him at the cart's tail! Celano. You shall. Fool. Heyday, you humour me;âthen hang him up by the leg and moralize. I'd preach to him by the hour. Celano. You shall. Fool. An' yet to see the poor man pull a long face, and convince him only by smiling could he hope to stand on two legsâto propose to him either to dimple his cheeks with laughter or his neck with the noose; all the time he fixing his dull fish eye upon me till it glazed. It were a spectacle! Celano. He shall. The Archbishop walks much a' nights on the long terrace by the chestnuts. Lie on the wall and listen. Keep your ears prick'd for treason. Fool. I'll be tale-bearer, To see th' Archbishop hanging by the leg, His long face downward! Ha, ha, ha! Celano. You shall. [Exeunt. Scene IV. âA Room. Enter Iolante and Clara. Iolante. My Clara, comfort me. I have no maids About me now; my bright Azaire is gone, With her pretty Moorish ways, and Madeleine, So sweet a preacher to my playfulness,â For, Clare, I must be playful. Oh, I feel A loneliness upon me, even here In Sicily half-exiled. Clara. Can that be With Markwald's sister for companion?âbut I've seen you yawn in Markwald's company. He's good enough for the king. Iolante. And yet for Iolante's veins too slow. A child, I laugh'd and clapp'd my hands beside The rivers that ran swift; the sluggish streamsâ Clara. Iolante! These are most disloyal words. I trust you feel some rev'rence for a name The Emperor holds in honour. Iolante. Ay, and you, You girl with the grave face, I trust you feel A proper reverence For the Lord High Admiral, who has, at best, For the great Empire that you venerate But politic affection? Clara. Do you doubt? Iolante. Come now, I have you! Do you love this man Better than your own German land and tongue? Will you forget them all, and with his kiss Receive Sicilia to your heart? Clara. Oh no! My brother wishes me to marry himâ And, and ... Iolante. That massy raven hair framing a brow Of stainless marble! Clare, I often think With men, like Margarito, who have lives Fulfill'd of knightly enterprise, the tears They have no time to shed, soften the clime O' the eyes to exquisite humidity. Clare, did you see how as he turn'd he gave His life away with one glance of his eyes? Clara. He's right to trust me so; we German girls Are never treach'rous. Iolante. The wise brother Mark, For all your bitter words, has shown no fear Of a Sicilian bride. Clara. Who slanders him Behind his back. Iolante. Most virulently:ânot my lord alone. 'Tis natural In me, removed from anything I love, To eye in the cold blood of commentary Its virtues and defects. My Markwald's voice Makes me again a partisan. But, Clare, You think I love you is a spell to keep Margaritone at your side? I say He'll need to be cajoled, implored, malign'd, Threaten'd, entreated twenty times a day To keep in temper;âmore, to be amused, As to his head, sweet Clara, by your wit. Can you listen to his sonnets? Shall you care Hear of his Arab training? In a word, Can you dish up this crude sincerity Into a pretty falseness without guile? Clara. Never; that is your way. Iolante. Go, sullen girl! But when you're mew'd up with your tapestry, Your lord a-hunting, sick of his dull home, You'll cease to blame Your sister Iolante: you will know She's the wise matron who, when truth's a thorn, Mosses it o'er with falsehood for the feet She loves to tread on.âI was saying, dear, [Enter Markwald.] She knows not how to rule my countrymen. Clara. She says Sincerity is crude; moss it with lies For lovers' footsteps. Markwald. Iolante! Wife! Iolante. Thus he expostulates!âBut why this brow So over-clouded? Markwald. Women's tears, they rust The blade of manhood! I have stood two hours By the old stricken queen, who on her knees Beseeches Henry to return her child, When he's discrown'd him. â'Tis himself I want; His breath, his hair, his limbs.â She supplicatesâ âTake all his royalties.â Iolante. There is no way? Markwald. My lord is stark; she must resign the child Into his charge. Iolante. Oh, he's too mere a babe For men to handle. Markwald. Could you nurture him Till he's of age for convent disciplineâ For he must be a priestâmy lord might yield, As you're my wife. He knows our loyalty. Clara. Why Iolante would so love the boy She'd join in a conspiracy to put The crown on 's head. Markwald. Foul slander, Clare; she trusts Her husband so entirely she would give The children of her body to be torn Piecemeal if he required it. If I win [Exit Clara. This favour, you must show a great reserve To Margarito and Sybilla. Iolante. Yes. For the rest mother, I could no more face Such spoil of nature than frequent the streets Of a sack'd town; but Margarito, think!â Whom Clare will soon becloud, we must not keep His spirits on low diet, or the king Will dream he's plotting treasons. She's too slow For a Sicilian. Markwald. From experience You speak?â Iolante. Yes, Markwald, you can't understand Half that I fell:âfor Sicily, Sybilla, Margarito, even you, Not half the ways I love you. [She puts up her hands to caress him; as he pushes them back, a joint of his armour grazes one of them. Markwald. You must learn Not fight against my will when I command. You think yourself too clever; I must keep My wife from peril.âWhat, you are not hurt? It's nothing. Iolante. A mere scratch; but such may break The skin of the spirit. You'll not rule me thus. Leave me awhile. [Enter Margarito.] Margarito. Iolante, I am come To have you teach me how to court my love. She's obstinate. Iolante. Then try the Teuton way. Drive your affection as with hammer in The soft places of her heart. Margarito. I did not know I broke upon your privacy. Markwald. You do. At present for state reasons 'tis my wish That you be little at my house; my wife, I trust, may have Prince William in her charge To teach the German language. Margarito. I obey, Most grateful for the cause; intelligent Of your prudent fear and forethought. Markwald. There you judge Most circumspectly. I'll unfold you more. I would befriend Sicilia. [Going. Iolante [aside]. He is gone. Before a stranger I've insulted him, My Markwald! I have given him no son, And he a child of my own race to rear.â I'll sue for grace in Margarito's sight. Margarito!âOh, my lord! [They return.] Thanks, on my knees, For your great gift and pardon! When you say In our Sicilian, which you blunder at, A word too strong, I put it back again In your own speech more gentleâso I sought To turn you from a course that seem'd more stern Than I with wifely privilege descry The purpose of your heart. [Markwald turns to her. Exit Margarito. Markwald. Iolante, God hath given us no child. I thought the boy would comfort you. Iolante. He willâ Not only as Sicilian, as your gift. Oh, Markwald ... [Sobs. Markwald. There, there! Why the merest touch Of a mail'd hand brings blood to a woman's cheek. Kneeling for pardon! Love, a German wife Could not look humbler in her penitence, Nor half so handsome. Iolante. End as you beganâ Wife, Iolante! Markwald. Iolante, wife. [Clasping her. Scene V. âCelano's House. A Room. Enter Madeleine and Azaire. Azaire. It grieves me sore Thus to receive your service. Madeleine. 'Tis his will And Heav'n's. I, humbling thus myself, shall win High place in paradise. Your beauty is A snare to him. Azaire. Is 't that? I cannot tell. I love him, Madeleine. It seems to me That other women cannot look on Love Save it be dress'd for them a thousand ways. My appetite can diet on raw meat. You love because 'tis profitable; Christ Will think of your humility; while I Love simply, madly, as I love the food In sight when I am hungry. 'Twas a whim That set the veil on me; but if instead You had been honour'd, and my only hope Of being loved by him a life of shame, I would have stoop'd to 't. If I could not be The silver flagon for his lips at feast, Then the horn-cup he'd catch up for a drink When he was thirsty, hunting. So I love. I do not care for anything but love, Nor how I get it. He is coming in. You'll leave us, Madeleine. Madeleine. My lord forbids That I should ever leave you. I'll retire In shadow to my tapestry. [Retires. Azaire [aside]. How cold The girl is! I could hate her. [Enter Celano.] Celano. Well, Azaire, My little spit-fire wife, what angers you? Azaire. I'm vex'd and angry at this misery. [Points to Madeleine. Remove it from me ere I kiss you. Celano. See, My pretty tyrant, how your slave obeys. Madeleine, leave us. [Exit Madeleine. There!âHow lovelier You look each hour, a rose-bud that at dawn Was only a red rose-bud and to-night Bends over me all rose, even to the air It breathes on me. Say, are you wholly mine? In the whole world do you love aught but me? Azaire. You're all to me. One language and one life Are far too short for me to reckon up My wealth in you. Celano. Do you love God? Azaire. Oh no! Not in the least; remove that jealousy. Celano. Why that is well; then you are wholly mine. Azaire. No, you are mine, mine own. Celano. Yours, little fool! Ay, as a wine-butt is sole property O' the cup. I am the world's. Azaire. Oh, misery! You love none save Azaire? Celano. I woo a dame Who pray'd me on her knees to marry her. Azaire. She loves you? Celano. No. Why is it that you love? Tell me, Azaire. Azaire. You're beautiful; your voice Is like a touch to me, your touch a bond. Celano. None ever loved Celano in this sort. Azaire. And does Celano love that other one So, thus? Celano. What, Madeleine? Azaire. That girl who asks? Celano. You mean your servant. No, child; but the king Compels me to receive the icy girl In my reluctant arms. Azaire. Then must I die. Celano. O you delicious creature, no reproach! Flee from me, sorceress! Among the hills I have a tiny villa. There I'll come; Nay, do not bind meânot a pledge. You know You are the only woman in whose love I have delight. You love so senselessly You satisfy my soul. No tears! You start At dawn; till then we'll make the darkness glad. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âA Window-seat in a Chamber of the Palace. Enter Constantia and Iolante. Constantia. O Iolante, was not that an owl I' the sun-basking ivy? Yet forsooth, The shadow of Time's finger points the noon, Saw we a dial. Wherefore then this owl, This hooded thing on the bright glove of day, This page of purblind Night, this trumpeter To tongueless apparitions? Iolante. 'Tis to prick Our joy with sense of mutability. Constantia. Did you not smile, your answer had been sad. Ah me! There's even such a rueful prophet lurks Behind my branching gladness. Iolante. 'Tis to make More precious your felicity. Constantia. False cheer! Obscure Distrust sits in my joy's recess, Distrust, O Iolante, of my lord. I've laid Sicilia in his grasp. To see A mail'd hand close over a butterfly Were not more cruel. Ah, there was a time I could have mated you! But then he came, Th' Apulian Conqueror, and gave my sweet'st Companion to his stalwart captain ere My lips recover'd liberty. And I Must bear him children, as my countrymen Yield him their labour's first-fruits. My desire Is not to make him father; 'tis to give A man-child to my country. O my land, My life, my blood, for thee my womb's in toil, And I shall see thy prince's heritage Trampled before my face; Sicilian blood Pour'd out by him who hath begot my child. This is distraction. Iolante. Such distraction waits On motherhood, my queen; full treasuries Bring terrors and forebodings of the thief; Pangs that the poor Would suffer smiling. Were I in your case, Sweet lady, I would bear your world of cares To feel a babe's hand patter its soft praise O' my bosom's bounty. But you err to think My monarch forced me into marriage-bonds. I love the good duke Markwald; openly, With all the noblest of my land in sight, I must have chosen him; he's true of heart, Most stern for justice. Constantia. Iolante, sayâ Do you love best your country or your lord? Iolante. My lord so well that I have given him Even to his charge my Sicily in trust. Constantia. Oh, Iolante, I abide at home And will not see plots brewing,âwill not see Old playmates in mask'd faces greeting me. A shadowy headsman ever is behind; While Henry keeps Close lips and moves about with courtesy. There's thunder in his nature. Iolante. A sweet son Will soften him. The Hohenstaufen hair, Keep to the golden tinct. Constantia. My southern blood Repels invasion from the north; my child Will be all Sicily. Unhappy boy, A poet-hearted prince, set i' the midst Of barbarous TeutonsâIolante! What! Are you asleep?âAlmost. The very time, Still with satiety of light and heat, Is Slumber's opportunity. Lie here; Do as your eyes would have you, for their lids Are curving to half-moons. Iolante. And leave the queen Untended! Constantia. Others with more wakeful orbs Shall dress me for the council, which my lord Untimely holds at mid-day. Sicily Is on her knees that I should slumber not. [Exit Constantia. [Iolante sleeps; to her enter Margarito.] Margarito. The halcyon Sleep Hath made a blessed calm. O safest hour To turn her with the helm of my desire From anchor'd port to Love's free waves. But if She will not swerve?âwhy, then there is the make O' the brute in Markwald; if I madden him, He'll so be-tyrant her, she'll take my course; She's the prow-head of my spirit.âWhat! My glove! I'll leave it here for Markwald to surmise His worst; my longings far outleap his fears. I'll kiss her for an earnest of my guilt. Iolante, I'm audacious. I'll awake And daze her with the glare of my wild love. My Iolante! [Kissing her passionately; she wakes Iolante. Where's Margarito?âWhat a cry is this?â From such assault Your sword, my knight, should save me. Slay the beast Who with vile purpose hath surprised my couch. Margarito. I must be satisfied ... Iolante [aside]. I'm safe; scarce knew I, waking suddenly, What had befallen. Heaven give me strength To rescue him from peril.âWhy to-night I'll yield to your entreaties; we'll cajole The unsuspecting Teuton; he shall learn What it is to trust Sicilians.âYou are cold; You do not answer me. Margarito. Oh horrible To catch Lust's accents on those holy lips! The fair saint Iolante I'd seduce; Not a base creature who would tempt me with Suggestion fouler than my devilish thought. Iolante. The solemn Clara shall be mock'dâ Margarito. Peace, peace! It is as God's own mother from her shrine Should stoop to tempt and cozen. I'll away From this cursed Sicily; all patriot thought I'll smother and resign myself To any life of blasphemy: what hope If Iolante is ... Iolante. There is no hope For any land whose women dare not trust Their countrymen. I, in Sicilia's name, Appeal to you. From holy sleep I woke To find you in temptation. Heav'n hath heard, Camping the legion'd angels round your soul, Ere my slow prayers could mount. Confess yourself At chapel, Margarito. Do not think Of Clara till you're shriven. Margarito. And of you Never? You set a gulf 'Twixt my damn'd exile and your blessedness? [Half-aside.] I'll bridge it an unhallow'd way ... Iolante. I trust The man who not a moment could delight In woman thought disloyal. From henceforth I trust you wholly, Margarito. But, Since noble Markwald's sister hath a heart Like her brother's of true temper, I must train Your ill-deserving spirit to receive The worship of such natures. Fare you well. [Giving her hand, which he kisses reverently. [Exit Margarito. [Sobbing bitterly.] What is there in me brings the devils thick As flies to honey? Is it possible A knight could fall to lust of anything That has no smutch of sin? At church I've seen A picture of lean Lust; she dieted On refuse. Faugh! [going to a mirror] I am not beautiful Th' ensnaring way. My simple netted hair It's wavy brown and only good enough For the wind to play with; and my skin is clear; My Markwald says I have a homely cheek For an honest man to kiss; and any child Has eyes like these. Veronica 's a throat One needs must gaze on as the dazzling wall Faced with chalcedony; mine's common stone. [Enter Markwald.] Markwald. My wife before a mirror! Vanity! Iolante. Markwald, what do you see here? Markwald. Not a saint, And by no means a beauty; not a flow'r, Nor jewel; but a pretty little girl, Who'll sing and smile and not forget her pray'rs For one she loves;âa little thing to trust. [She silently embraces him and goes out. She kiss'd me sobbing; she is not herself. [Taking up the glove.] What's yonder?âMargarito's glove!âThe fool 's Been telling her she's handsome: my poor praise Doubtless fell flat. I will not suffer him About my wife. Iolante! [Re-enter Iolante.] What is this? Iolante. A glove. 'Twas Margarito let it drop; He has been with me, had been with me now But that I sent him to confession: he Displeased me much. Markwald. Confess to me the sin You sent him to the priest with. Iolante. What, betray! Shall a priest's ear Be safer than a lady's breast? My lord, No curious torture could wring out from me The least Of the words you woo'd me with: they're buried here 'Mong other precious relics: rifle not! What's laid on the altar 's consecrate, altho' It be not my lord Markwald's offering. [Curtsies, playfully shakes her head, and retires. Markwald. I like it not; yet could as lief accuse A child of treason as that face of thought Un-innocent. Some grief of her country's perhaps With which he pester'd her. Poor child, she loves Her Sicily, and I must execute My king's commands, discrown her little prince To-morrow. It will cut her to the heart. [Exit. Scene II. âRoom of State. Enter with great pomp the Emperor, the Empress, Prince William, Markwald, Celano, Margarito, Sybilla, Iolante, Veronica, and others. Emperor. My Germans and Sicilians, whom the cloak Of empire would enfoldâmy equal care, To-day we take our lawful sovereignties From the thief's hand, glad that his tender years So plead for him, we can preserve his life. His ancestorsâ Sybilla [aside, looking passionately at the Emperor]. Curse him, ye dead! Emperor. Have brought The fair boy to this day's disgrace; he stands Bringing the colour to Sicilian cheeks At thought of their misplacÃ¨d fealtyâ Sybilla [aside]. Curse him, ye living! Emperor. For the guilt of birth Desiring pardon: eager to protest His parents did most wrongfully usurp My southern throne. Sybilla [aside]. O God the Father, curse! Come hither, child. [As he comes to her, she thrusts him forward, and looks up to heaven, then glances at the Emperor.] Curse him, O Christ the Son. Iolante. He doth not cry; his face is like a cloud That holds the rain. Celano. Come, little lord, step up. Empress. Come hither. Markwald. Bravo! Archbishop. Kneel, and speak by me. Prince William. I, William, unlawfully called of Sicily king, do here on my knees tender to my liege-lord Henryâ Emperorâthe crown and lands which are his, to hold and have; beseeching mercy for the great sin of their treasonous retention by me and my fathers committed against God and our liege-lord, whose hand I kiss and tremble. [Thunder. Margarito [aside]. It is not thunder, but Sicilia's groan. Emperor. Rise, Count of Lecce,ârightful title this, Which sons may bearâa spotless heritage. Our dearest vassal, our henceforward joy! Sicilians, see! our knees are Mercy's throne. Margarito [aside to Iolante]. The golden light hath tasted misery In the bow'd sunshine of that golden head, That leaves our hearts in night. Iolante. Oh, do not speak! Emperor. Yet since on stock of rude disloyalty We would engraft obedience, this boy, From the accustom'd care of his own kin We take, to give him, underneath our eye, New cherishing and foster discipline, Entrusted to staunch Markwald and his wife. Markwald. Sire, we are honour'd servantsâCome to her. [Leads William to Iolante. Sybilla [raising her head]. MariaâMother! Curse the barren thing Whose womb was never thrill'd nor bosom suck'd, To whom they give the child that I have borne. Iolante. Willie!âmy little ... [He bursts into tears. Margarito [aside]. His tears within us blush to drops of blood We'll weep in battle. Archbishop [aside]. Cover up your fires, Friend Admiral. Iolante [aside]. There, there! We'll go away.â I'll take him to my little privy bow'r, Wherein the honied woodbine's dainty paps Suckle the bees, and tell him fairy-tales. [Exit with Prince William. Sybilla. You've stripp'd me of my child; 'twere modesty To hide my naked motherhood. Markwald. Yes, yes. Emperor. We spare your presence.âTake her from the hall. Rejoice, Sicilians, for your lawful queen Will speedily present you with a prince Worthy your homage. Stay, Constantia, stay, Smile on your people and confirm their hope. Constantia. I'm deadly faint. [Retiring. Emperor. You'll be obedient; 'Tis the ex-queen retires. [Taking her hand, he presents her to the people. See, she descends To mingle with you and receive your loves. Thus intermarried [glancing toward Markwald and Iolante,] we shall breed a race Will overcome the world. [Exeunt all save Margarito and the Archbishop of Salerno. Archbishop. You lag. Margarito. He will not reach the ships till noon. I entertain him there. Archbishop. You note he pass'd Betwixt two rows of corpses to the feastâ His queen look'd not more ghastly. Margarito. I've the fleet. Those lords [pointing to the Sicilian train] I'll answer for. Can you contrive To visit them and preach submission To their new earthly lord? Archbishop. I'll stir their blood. That boy I wash'd in baptism, and now Have stain'd the royal roses of his lips With fond self-slander and base perjury. Margarito. We yet will teach them truth! No whispering, No nervous penitence; be affable; This is a holiday: go you to church; Welcome your monarch to its shrine. To-night You shall confess me as the clock strikes twelve. [Exeunt. Scene III. âA Porch. Enter Veronica, Adheld following. Veronica. Come hither, Adheld. You're my lord's fair squire. [He kneels and presents a letter from Celano. What think you of his service, sweetest boy? Adheld. So highly do I rate him, lady, all He does I imitate; what he admires I find most admirable; where he bows In worship, I more reverently kneel. He teaches me religion; 'tis thro' him Mine eye drinks in divinity. Veronica. In sooth! Oh, these are pretty speeches in a boy. Is 't to your tasteâ [Breaking the seal of the letter. Yes, fan me!âthat your sister acts the part Of servant to a Moor? Now, sweet young face, Be frank. Adheld. My lord by CÃ¦sar hath been urged To right this strangest injury:âmy blood Not long will bear the insults that are heap'd On Madeleine. Veronica [passing her hand over his brow]. We women of the world Can but confess to utter innocence. I'm going now To be familiar with you, as a child I should take up, and sob upon his neck; Such trust I have in you. Adheld. 'Tis too much grace. Veronica. Doth the Virgin tell in Heaven what she hears Betwixt the warm veil'd lips and Ave-sighs? I know she's secret. I have faith in you. You'll hear, and you'll obey me, for you love. My squire, I'll make you perfect in Love's arts, And when they're yours, I'll smile to see them used [Sighing] On some sweet girl I mother'd at the font. Incredulous! Ah!âYou'll obey my words? Adheld. As my lord's orders. Veronica. Then you'll never let Your sister fall, not even as a bride, Prey to the dread Celano. Get her housed Safe in a nunnery. My heart implores. I am his victim; he refuses me The one name that can right me. Help me,âho! Sweet holy Adheld as thou hop'st to take The vows of knighthood: 'tis for my good name I seek to be Celano's wife, the while, Adheld, I shudder at his proffer'd love. Adheld. Lady, you thrill such passion thro' my soul That if it be your will the poison-draught Should follow marriage, I am cup-bearer. All, all that wrongs you is my enemy. Veronica. Fair child, forget this tragedy; be gay. Serve me as you have opportunity. Fail not to tell Celano how I droop, A plant in darkness, wither'd for his sun. I teach you no deceptionâfalter not. And do not miss to wait on me each day, For comfort's sake of your pure morning face. [Kissing his brow. Exit Adheld. I give him but the irony of truth. My hair is silv'ring fast. He'll win for me The bridal crown before this amorous wealth Is meagre. How I win men with a smile! The purest sees my sorrow, not my sin. Andrea will be the Church's saint; at least Seduced Veronica shall take her place 'Mong holy matrons.âI am bidden forth. [Looking at the letter. Celano holds a dance within his halls. [Exit within. Scene IV. âA Council-chamber. Enter Emperor, Celano, Markwald, and others. Emperor. There's thunder in the air; the chargÃ¨d wrath Best burst from us! Misdoubt me not; I smelt The sulphur in the first Sicilian breeze; When Margarito at the water's edge Received us with so infinite a grace, I mark'd himâan indomitable eye! We put that sort of pris'ner to the sword, Or we should never nap upon our throne When we are sleepy. That's an eye to quench. Markwald. You wrong him, Sire; he's a true gentleman Of bounteous nature. Emperor. So you warranted. We had not else suffer'd our noble Clare To be affianced to him. Celano. Confidence Hath a weak ankle, and the veriest stone Of adverse circumstance may trip it up. Let's test Margaritone ere we trust. He's amorous and free of tongue; your wife Sicilian, and in wisely courage safe. Let them be close; if treason's in the land, She'll give it us, the native accent pure. Emperor. Good; for this peace rots as a pestilence. But if the gallant lady find no plot? Celano. We'll hatch one. Emperor. Set your brains to work, and have Your creatures ready, for I'm sick to death Playing the part Of feast-drowsed monarch, when I'm warn'd sharp steel Is wanted: give me pretext and I'll strike. Markwald. Patience, my liege: Justice they say is blind, Impartial and not hood-winked. Emperor. Set your dame To play the pining patriot. Markwald. I will. As she is my true wife, her single aim Will be her king's security. [Exit Markwald. Emperor [to Celano]. You smile? Celano. Ha! ha! The woman is not born will see such throat Disparted from such shoulders. Emperor. I'm content With the policy in train: thanks, gentlemen. [Exeunt Emperor, Celano, Councillors. Scene V. âA Room in Celano's House. Madeleine working a veil; she pauses and looks at a picture on the wall. Madeleine. I thought it was Celano in his youth before he saw the world. He tells me 'tis his brotherâstill 'tis very like. I wonder where is the difference! I seeâthis lacks the funny lines about the mouth, and the eyes have not the polish. I want to pray to this picture as to a Saint Sebastian. I drop a bead a moment for Celano's soul. No one else but Madeleine would have patience to pray him into peace again. Since that wedding-day have I slept an hour? Yet when he's penitent he'll look like this. He has the smileâand there's such a landscape in his face to light when he throws the sun on it! [Enter Adheld.] Dear brother! Adheld. Where's your mistress? Madeleine. Gone to the coast, and, Adheld, she returns no more. Celano promised me when he came back from lifting her on her horse she should not return; so your quarrel with my lord is ended, and your sisterâsee!âis working for her bridal. Adheld. While the last bride is throttled by assassins. Madeleine. Peace, brother! you forget we are betroth'd. Palermo looks on me as an injured wife. Adheld. If betrothal hold you, there's a lady to whom Celano was betroth'd as you say, ere he mimick'd love in your eyesâa lady whom, by force or some vile sorcery, he hath dishonour'd and keeps shame-gagg'd in her misery. Madeleine. Some beauty that tempted:âhe's not betroth'd. Adheld. Little tortoise-skull! how is it with your heart? Can one tread on it and leave no stain on the foot? Toss it to yon villains paving the street! I tell you, had you any faith or charity, you'd refuse him, take that veil, and give yourself to Christ. Madeleine. I cannot thinkâ Adheld. True, you fat flesh-heap! If Celano gave you a piece of gold and show'd you the very blood that purchased it, you'd say he got it honestly. I tell you, as Celano is my master, I serve him; but you, as you are Heaven's bond-maid, must disown him. He comes. Madeleine, work my will in this. [Exit. [Enter Celano.] Celano. Well, Madeleine, what says the boy to you? Madeleine. He wishes me to take the veil. Celano. Oh, then Tis lightly done. I loose you from the bond Of my pre-contract with you. Madeleine. You consent? Celano. I do not force you; since the Emperor Takes int'rest in you, I consult his will; And if it be that I should marry you, I shall do 't as I should take a city; if Meanwhile you do not wed yourself to Heaven. Madeleine. You ask a vessel, would it profit her Remove the helm and with a childish crew Drift on the waves! Give my unguided life Your merciful direction. Celano. Madeleine, To-day I'm busy. Tell me what that boy Was urging on you: be obedient. Madeleine. He said you'd wrong'd a lady who desired That you should wed her; and he threaten'd me Because of that I should not be your wife. Celano. Call Adheldâand you, tell your rosary. [Exit Madeleine, returning with Adheld. [To Madeleine.] If you like, listen. Adheld, you have kiss'd Veronica's fair hand and felt the dew Of her most excellent tears across her cheek. You're ripe to poison me at her command. Nay, blush not; I read clear; all's fair in love. It is an arrant sorceress! My boy, You think I've wrong'd her. Look upon that face, [Pointing to the picture. Or cross the street and ask for Andrea The priest who tends yon altar. Learn of him Who to dishonour brought the stateliest girl Man ever worshipp'd. I, my Adheld, sought To wed her, and she mock'd me. Adheld. Dear my lord, It was her modesty; she could not speak The past; she's clear! So look the saints whose robes Are dyed in blood; she'd stain her purity With penitential tears. Celano. Poor child, you're snared. You'd strive to force me wed the loveliest bride Sicilia ever grew her myrtles for. Your artifice I smile at. Madeleine, Will you be sway'd by me, or ... Madeleine. I am yoursâ I was. You never were betroth'd to herâ Lady Veronica? Celano. Then we'll not fix The day of your espousalâto the Lord? Adheld [to Madeleine]. Have you no pity? May your hard heart rot Each day by morsels. Dear my lord have grace, Give to the great Veronica the hand Alone can hold her from abysmal shame. Celano. Adheld, my honourable sentiments To your sister half deter me. Adheld. Do not call So mean a thing my sister! Of my blood She is not, but a slave to her own lust. [Exit. Celano. Pray for me, Madeleine. [Exit. Madeleine. He looks to me for salvation. My duty is plain; this veil must be his bride's to save him from the snare of the evil woman. I will pray for him till my tongue swoons! Oh, what peril to him from the creature who could stain the innocence of the Church's holy son. Thank Heaven, I'm fast betroth'd. I'll leave this vanity [gathering up her work] to pray him white as he was ere he went to court [looking at the picture]. A very seraph's brow! [Kisses it, and exit. [Re-enter Adheld wildly.] Adheld. A damnÃ¨d monk! Scene VI. âA Hall. Enter Markwald and Iolante. Markwald. Iolante, 'tis my wish that you to-day Greet Margarito, for whom Clara sighs, And let him see young William; note his mood, If with the sight it alter. Iolante. This is strange; You banish'd Margarito from your house. Markwald. Orders are now reversed. You are not glad Again to be his hostess? Iolante. Not his spy. It is unworthy of you, dear my lord, To put your Iolante to such use, That you no more can teach her to fulfil Than train an innocent, glad singing-bird Hawk-wise to fix and fasten on its prey. You keep your Iolante for delight I' the music that she makes you; not at all To loose from wrist that she may bear you back The quarry of your bleeding enemies. Markwald. Is Margarito then an enemy? Iolante [laughing]. Of whom?âthe Emperor? Markwald. He comes. Obey. [Exit. Iolante. What means my lord to put me in this strait? [Attendants lead in Prince William.] They bring the boy: he shall not look on him; There's that in 's face must grow to royalty, And it might tempt ... Prince William. Mutter! Iolante. A German word! So good at learning!âThere, sweet boy, enough! I'm sick to-day, and cannot stay to spell The bright page of the missal: to the priest! [Exit Prince William and Attendants. [Listening.] He's found the childâI catch the tenderness Of voice. We will not speak of him at all. [Enter Margarito.] Margarito. Iolante, are you here alone?âin tears? Iolante. Sybilla ... Margarito. Not Sybilla, Sicily Forgets the child she bore. Iolante. I'm Markwald's wifeâ Even regret is treason in report. In mine ear's treasury whate'er is cast Is wealth my lord distributes at his will. Margarito. You tell me that in the Sicilian tongue? What, use it as a traitor? Iolante. Not so grave! Wives forget every bond when once they wear This pledgeâ Margarito. Oh, tell meâdo our slaves in chains So forget freedom?âIolante, say, Why am I summon'd? Iolante. My lord summon'd you; For what I know not. Margarito. And can scarce devise A hasty welcome.âWhat is that you do? Iolante. A shirt I'm making for my foster-child. These cares are new to me, and cost some tears, For I am sonless, and my pretty guest Is going to a convent. Margarito. What! your prince? Iolante. Tush, tush! It's the child I'm thinking of; so delicate! He's rooted in my heart; transplanting him, So frail a slip, to rougher Earthâ Margarito [drawing Iolante to the window]. Look there! The child, who owns that:âall that jewelry Of sea, the shining marble of these roofs, Iolante, is preparing for the cowl? [Markwald and Celano enter unseen.] Celano. Stay! With what fix'd eyes they are looking down On the city! How he turns to make appeal! Markwald, pass on: you know she'll tell you all. [Exeunt. Iolante. Distrust me, I beseechâI must reportâ Margarito. Sweet patriot, do not so belie yourself. Iolante [turning round on him]. I swear to you I will be ever true To noble Markwald; you, I straight dismiss For daring utter to me words no wife Must listen to:âthis is the only lie To save betrayal. Go! [Exit Margarito. [Enter Markwald.] Markwald. Have you obey'd? Iolante. My lord, I've wholly fail'd to play my part. Margaritone has a lover's way; And, ere we enter'd into grave discourse, He put into his gestures and his tones What well I know my Markwald would not like, So I have straight dismiss'd him. Markwald. When you stood Together, looking at the city, then Were you dismissing him? Iolante. Even then in thought. I did not summon him. I cannot play The spyâbe mask'd to my old friends. My lord, Christmas is coming on, and the great feast For which I am not able. Let me go To our little sea-side villa. There I'll stay Where I can bring no harm to those I love. Markwald. Who are they, Iolante? Iolante. You, my lord; Margaritone as a countrymanâ The child, all these. I have a parting charge To make to you: trust, trust the Admiral In all state matters, and beware of him As rival. I'm o'er-scrupulous. You think A married woman must not hear a word Of praise from any but her lord. I won't. So pray you put me beyond reach; for here I must be much where my young countryman Frequentsâ Markwald. Capricious fancy! Well then, go ... And I must keep the feast without my wife. Your talk was then of personal affairs? Iolante. Yes!â Markwald. Clare shall go. Iolante. Margaritone sure Will seek to see her. I must be alone. Leave Clara here. Markwald [aside]. The man is doom'd.âNo, no. You'll go together. I will see you start This afternoon. There's myst'ry in my wife; [Exit Iolante. I would she had my sister's honesty! [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âRoom in a little lonely Villa. Andrea pacing up and down. Andrea. I am bidden here To one of his poor victims. Should he ask My priestly aid, I must confess him, yea, Wash from his soul the spots I'd have hell-fires Burn deep to ingrain'd devil. I must hear Of amorous encounters, while my hands Clutch the cold crucifix; mine unpurged blood Will leap responsive to the sin my lips Scourge with prescription of unnumber'd pray'rs. Oh yet There was a whiteness and a glory in My way of ruin. On the rosary I tell the minutes of that sacred hour. My lady stoop'd To teach me love, as she had taught a child The missal's pages; since, illiterate, The gold and crimson story would be lost To eyes so bright with wonder.âAh, she comes! [Enter Azaire, pale, with a child in her arms.] A temptress beauty, no Madonna, tho' She clasps a glorious babe. Azaire. He promised me You would be kind, you are his brotherâthis, This child, I bring for baptism his son; And I wed to him in the open church 'Mid lords and ladies! Fair Veronica Was there. I am his wife. I cannot live Without him. The last parting broke my heart. And he must keep away. I think he's dear To the pale, waxen, proud Veronica, Tho' now the Emperor forces him to wed The German girl he was betroth'd to first. He has been good To me; he loves me, and he'll own his child. They say you are his brother, sir. Andrea. I am. Your boy shall be baptized. What name? Azaire [passionately embracing the child]. My babe! I have no will; he call'd thee. Andrea, See that his father loves him; take the child. Andrea. Will you not shrive you, if so soon to die? Azaire. I am a Moor. Andrea. Oh, let me speak to you Of Christ and His great sorrows; you will burn In hell if thus you die.â Azaire. Thusâloving dear My husband and my child? Andrea. Nay, in your sins. Have you no hate Of that proud dame Veronica? You say She loves your husband? Azaire. I don't think of her In anger; me he lovesâpoor chrysalid, What is my worth now? Those the crimson wings [Pointing to the child. The glory of my nature went to fledge! Azaire shall live in her man-child. Oh, say I travel southward toward a deeper sunâ I die of thirst and hungerâthirst for love And hunger for my child. Oh, tell my lord The Moorish girl is dying in the sun. He'll see her eyes again in the dark boy She bore him; let him love the young Azaire! [Lays the child at his feet; as he raises it, she turns back, stretches her arms to it, and rushes out. Andrea [turning from the child]. What mockery! Our Andrea had sprung from gentlest bloodâ The tiny waxen figure put to sleep On a nun's virgin pallet! Ah, my son, My Andrea, we're buried from her breast, Dead both of us, murder'd for modesty; And when with fasts I strive to purge myself From mem'ry of my manhood's sweetest days, I see thee lying in thy little tomb And fall upon thy innocence to weep. So easily Thy breath was stopp'd. Thou liest in the arms Of Death, thy foster-nurse, mistaking her For thine own mother. One may kill a babe; But never curb the pulses of a man To a priest's ambling pace. Veronica, So cold, so hard thou think'st me, and I burn. I must away where women are not heard; Their silver voices at confessional Thrill me like music. I must take the cowl, Be where rough, angular, begrimÃ¨d monks Will make me loathe my own condition. Meanwhileâ[Pausing before the child.] Oh, he has children at desire; Yet when he found Veronica in hope Of motherhood, he came with ashen face, Told me to hide her in a nunnery, He would provide a coffin for my child. Nay more, he would forgive my treachery, Promote me in the Church, when he had scourged By private shame his dearer penitent, Would haply right herâbut he plays her false. He'll work the ruin of her soul. O God, Mete out to me the measure of Thy wrath In purgatorial fires: singe not Thy dove, For I who touch'd her silver plumes well know They cannot tarnish: mix them with the wings Of angels, Thou wilt lose them in the white; Then turn Thy unappeasÃ¨d face on me. I shall not weary of my punishment So she escape. To-day I take the cowl. [Exit. Scene II. âA Chamber. Enter Celano, a miniature in his hand and a roll of parchment. Celano [looking at the portrait]. Veronica, Thou'lt write at my dictation words that doom Thy dearest countryman; thou shalt be false To every creature that thou lovest, ere I pardon thy great treason with my name. How I remember when I was a boy I thought all Heaven's blue was in those eyes. [Putting up the miniature.] Had she been spotless, I had been her slave Who am her subtle tyrant; yet no pain I can inflict on her can touch the hurt She wrought upon my nature. Here's the king, Who thinks I work to pleasure him. [Enter Emperor and Markwald.] Emperor. What news? Those rolls of parchmentâMarkwald, my worst fears Celano's searches have confirm'd; he's found A document that tells the truth as frank As witness under pressure of the screw, Revealing all. Markwald. Then is the writing forged. Celano. So I surmise; yet it may yield a clue; My spies shall fathom it. Within a week We'll sit in judgment on a ripe revolt, We will discover all. Markwald. By honest means. My lord, I like not subterfuge. Celano. Although You use a spy, your wife! What news through her Of the Lord Admiral? Markwald. She's sick, retired. Celano [persistently]. Through Clare? Markwald. What! set a girl to wreck her love? I'll not believe Margaritone's false; [Aside to Celano.] You force the king against him. [Aloud.] If we thus Suspect and harass, we shall make him vile. Celano. I see you've no suspicion. Painful scenes Must follow on this plot's discovery I fain would spare you knowledge ... Markwald. Painful scenes! If Iolante's self Were brought before me as a traitor, I Would doom her to a traitor's death, I swear, Nor ever flinch. What angers me is this: You put disloyal thoughts in simple heads. The people here are happy in the thought Of keeping festival with their good king; Celano, rack your brains to give them sport. Spy on the revels, and no deed of blood Will need your censorship. Celano [to Emperor.] Will you appoint, My liege, when I of southern treachery Bring proof, this fearless and impartial judge, The uncorrupted Markwald, to assign The several punishments To the discover'd wretches: misery Will be enough to me in leading them Into their toils: let Markwald seal their doom. Emperor. Markwald shall be our grand justiciary. Markwald. I will: Celano, use you lawful means; See I condemn you not for stirring up Sedition. Celano. See you have not to condemn Those you hold dearest to you. Have a care. [Exeunt. Scene III. âAn Ante-chamber to a large Ball-room in Celano's House. Celano, exquisitely attired, watches from a distance the dancers. Veronica passes. Celano. What a flower she is, a balsam! We are each masters in the art of winning men's soulsâI to perdition, she to a fool's paradise! She thinks to bring me to her feet a victim; she shall lie at mine; though the landscape be fair, that to a conqueror's eye means desolation. I'll change the face of that fair country her body;âno respite till ruin bring her to subjection. She's dancing with Margarito; I like not the dominance of that grasp. Should he win her, I were baulked. Now he's offering her jasmine; that jasmine she shall tread under foot before sunrise. [Enter a Page.] Page [presenting letter]. My lord! Celano [reading]. âThe lady who calls herself your wife brought to me two days ago her babe for baptism. The attendants who followed her report, as I suspect to order, that they found her asleep under a cactus, a snake coiled about her loins. I send you your son, having performed for him the rites of the Church, in the charge of a young woman Madeleine, who claims to be, by your authority, his nurse.â Celano [aside]. It's perfect. I secure her [looking towards Veronica]. Weary now, warm and a little love-faint! The room clears. The adieus! Does Margarito stoop low to smell the jasmine that his lips bend over it? He's gone. [To Page.] This to the lady. Bring her back. [Page returns with Veronica.] You've been dancing with a traitor. Veronica. You mistake; I danced with you; and the Lord Admiral For pity: there are dark lines round his eyes For Iolante; wherefore is she gone? Celano. Faugh! How that jasmine-tuft infects the air! Unloose it; trample it beneath your foot. Obedience! your toilet I will make. I hate the dull, white stars. Veronica. How exquisite Your sense of fitness; it's a wither'd flow'r, And gives a look of tire and negligence To one unweary. Celano [taking a gem from his dress]. Here's a brooch for you; An amethyst best sets those moon-white breasts. Now I can speak with you, I say, âBeware The pestilence that walks in darkness.â Think; One least speck of disloyalty would doom Your body to the dead-house. Veronica. Sure, the wine Hath wrought upon you. Never had the king A smoother front. All's well. Celano [drawing out some letters]. This pocketful Of letters will condemn the Admiral To deathâand the Archbishop. Veronica. They are forged! Celano. Well guess'd, fair Casuistry. The ink is wet Wherewith I penn'd them. I have left a page For you to fill. Veronica. What mean you? Celano. This: I need Your writingâjust the witness of your hand. Write a few lines of warningâlet them speak Of loyaltyâto Margarito. That You will not do? I bid you think again. Veronica. Never! Celano. The lover of the German girl Is dear to you. You've seen two German maids Preferred before youâMadeleine and Clare. Veronica. My lord is over-wearied, and his wits Do him dis-service. I will take my leave. Celano. You scorn such rivals, but Azaire held sway Over Celano's heart andâdo not turn From sweet blanch'd rose to snowdropâand Azaire Is dead. This is no forgery. To-night The Court shall hear of it. Veronica, If with those clear eyes you look'd up to me And said this matter'd not, the words were forged. Be not a perjurer. Veronica [trying to free herself]. You're keeping me Unduly for a guest. Celano. With lover's trust I'm treating you: to-morrow I depart In haste to my wife's funeral. You can Report to Margarito all I've said Before the feast when I present the king With these forged letters. You will not do this! If implicated in this plot you ne'er Can be Celano's bride, whoâhow you shake!â Aspires to the high honour of your hand. All know this ring; wear it as my betroth'd. Veronica. On what conditions? Celano. Simply write a note To Margarito; warn him 'gainst revolt. Say that the Germans seek Sicilia's good, And those are traitors who defeat their ends. Veronica. So I have ever thought; I would not stir In any foolish rising. You exact No more of me than thisâI take the ring And with it on my finger pen the words Of your dictation. [Sits down and writes. Celano. 'Tis to exculpate You from participation in the crime; And if I find you faithful, instantly, When Sicily is humbled, as reward For the better part you've chosen, you shall be Led to the priest. Veronica [looking at the ring and kissing it]. The gem is exquisite. Celano. I've seen you watch it flash across my hand, With envyâhalf-contempt: tho' smooth enough, My hands have not that rare transparency That makes flesh spiritual enough for these Moon-opals. Are you proud? Veronica. Vain-glorious As you are of your will. Farewell, my lord. [Gives him her jewelled hand to kiss. Exit. Celano. Country and lover yields she to her lust Of pow'r. I have the strategist's delight In circumventing her; how great her fall! Azaire, cup-bearer of the wine of lifeâ Azaireâshe loved me for my handsome curls And smiling lips, loved me as man, and I Made her my wife thereforeâwhile Madeleineâ She is my slave. Veronica! Oh, I Reserve for her a place. [To Attendants.] Bring me my boy. [Enter Madeleine with the child.] Madeleine. The baby sleeps. Celano. 'Tis a sign'd picture, this; Myself new-wrought in flesh. My fatherhood Is past suspicion; these dark lashes hide Haply his mother's eyes. Ah, keep them closed! The child is well! Now, Madeleine, you know What, as a sign of the respect I bear To you, as faithful servant of my will, I hold your due. Madeleine. My lord, it is enough That I may nurse the child. Celano. 'Tis not enough. You shall be made his step-mother. You know Of old we were betroth'd. A priest is here To make the marriage firm. I may not vex The king with private matters; for the nonce You shall have rooms and tendance for the child, But not until you have full wedding-right To rule as mistress o'er it. In a month I promise you open acknowledgment. Put off your terror. 'Tis not to the rack I'm leading you. Why here upon your neck Is the little band of peach-stones that I set Under the crucifix. Poor child, I've made Your love a cross to you. But you consent, Good Madeleine, to be my lawful wife? Madeleine. My lord, you are betroth'd to me. I do No wrong to poor Azaire, if I comply. Celano. The priest will meet us in the chapel. Come. Scene IV. âRoom in Margarito's House. Enter Margarito and the Archbishop of Salerno. Archbishop. There must be secrecy. Margarito. My lord, not a feather in our plumes must be dashed, not a tongue shall be padded, our horses' hoofs shall clink on the stones and our voices be heard through the open casement to the last. Archbishop. I, as it were in a reverie, will look round. Con you the names on the scroll [looking out cautiously]. That ringing voice is for a rouse. If the hen clucks she's not on her nest hatching treason. All the same I'll spy. Ah, a wedding! They were marrying and giving in marriage till the last day. Tessa, my child! [A Servant-maiden appears at a chamber window.] A troop of soldiers! One looks up, he marks the house; he winks. [Enter Fool below; looks up laughing.] Fool. My lord, you've a waiting-woman would kiss a fool. Think you not the race should be celibate? Indeed, 'tis probable Holy Church forbids fatherhood to the priest lest he perpetuate folly. Archbishop. My knave, what see'st thou, whom seekest thou? Fool. What see I? Tessa gaping at the bride. Get in and chide her, holy father. ... And yet more distinctly I see the doves on the housetop. Archbishop. Do not stare so at the house. Have you business here? Fool. Aye, with the Lord Margarito; a fool has always business with lovers, for their whole business is fooling. Archbishop. Pass in, pass in; do not whistle. There! On tip-toe! [Enter Fool, presenting a letter.] Margarito [covering the scroll with his mantle]. News From my love! Archbishop [aside, impatiently]. And a kingdom must wait a lover's leisure! See how his long fingers dally with the seal. [Aloud.] Break it! 'Tis the light heart of woman, dry and brittle; 'twill not bleed. Margarito [aside]. She's gone, my lady Iolante. [Aloud.] The rare Teuton wench denies me the light of her eyes [carelessly handing the letter to the Archbishop.] [To Fool.] Go. Fool. I've none to play with now the little prince is cowled and looks at the free birds as he strings his pater-nosters. Margarito. Tessa's a fairer toy [motions impatiently to him to go]. Fool [aside]. The very blink Of traitors in their eyes.âGod prosper you; Prosper youâ Margarito. How now? What is 't thou dost say? Fool [mockingly]. Nothing but âGod be with you, gentlemen.â [Exit. Archbishop [reading]. âIolante and I have retired to my brother's villa by the bay, for Iolante is sick and wearied of the Court, and I am ordered to accompany her. See we be not too lonely.â That's near the convent where the boy is hidden. The monks are all Sicilian and true to their royal noviceâsave the German abbot. Margarito. I'll adventure it! A ride to the monastery, a secret meeting with my hooded countrymen, and the child is mine. I'll take him to the caves by the sea, and the lady Iolante shall receive him in her lonely villa. She'll keep the prince till we come to possess him of his royaltiesâand I pay a visit to my love! Thou art fervid for thy country; 'tis by chance thou favourest a lover's zeal. Archbishop. How sayest thou? Pour out our plans with thy love-sighs! I'll not consent. Margarito. She'll cleave to me as my ring to her finger. Well, my lord archbishop, all is ready. The fleet is mine; every ruddy sail flaps to Sicilian air, and feels the thrill of its freedom. The gates are in the hands of the Germans; but here's a key Sicilians can use. This scroll contains all names of note in the land, and they are all sworn to our enterprise. The prince I secure; Iolante keeps him. So our enemies will search the convent in vain. The child stole away from his prayers; would not suffer discipline and made escape through a cleft in the wall: the brethren shall be dolorously searching for him when the creatures of the Emperor arrive. We are safe. Look not so mournful. 'Tis thy manner. The owl smiles not though the weather shines. Thou art haughty before the people; show thy pride in the face of thy fears. Archbishop.

Fair lady, we have memories;âthat day We gather'd figs 'neath the caruba-tree, Gathering and givingâtherefore I am come To bid farewell, before I ride to-night In chase of the little cruel recreant love Deserting me. You're right; the moon shines fair, Thrown as a bridal-veil across the land. Do you love Your land, Veronica? Veronica. Look at that peace, The trellis'd gold of the vines, the lucid hills, Those peasants singing as they saunter home. I think The moonlight comes that we may see our land Lying asleep. Look, Margarito, look! Margarito. I feel her breath On my brow,âSicilia's breath! So sweet a slave Chain'd to the ravisher? I am a man; That sight unsheathes my sword. Veronica. My patriot! [Pressing back his sword into the scabbard. Margarito. You'd spare your country's enemies? Veronica. I'd spare Virgilia and her goats; those fishermen Toiling at sea; the simple peasant wives Who laugh even at their prayersâ Margarito. And would not cry If widow'd by the Teuton. Veronica. Just beyond That light-irradiated chasm rests Iolante ... and your love. Margarito [laughing as he mounts his horse]. You mean my love, The Lady Iolante! Fare you well. Veronica [looking after him]. How hard I'm getting! I can see him go, And so I could to the headsman. I am hard; I'm growing worthy of Celano's bride. How the jewel flashes! I have kept it hid. Scene II. âA Room in the Villa. Iolante and Clara at work. Iolante. I'm tired of stitching daisies, and you sit Like Nature at her meadows. Well-a-day, Good Sis, I've little patience! Hark, who raps? [Knocking. I'd greet a mouse. [Enter Attendant and Messenger.] Attendant. The trusty coxcomb there Alone may give his letter to your hand. Iolante. Worthy obedience! My servant's tongue Improves your virtue serving it with taunts, As bitter herbs give relish to our meat. You shall be entertain'd. Messenger. Good mistressâno, I must not tarry. Iolante [to Attendant]. Take him to the gate. [Exeunt. Put down your work. Would you be glad to see Your love to-night? Clara. I never loved him so As when he walk'd with me, here in the fields. It seem'd to me, tho' I'm a simple girl, He had that trust in me that Markwald shows To youâhis wife. I care not to be teased And play'd with as some girls. Iolante. And you were proud? Clara. Yesâof his trust. Iolante. And worthy of it, Clare? Clara. Try me. Iolante. I will. Read this:â âGracious and beloved Iolante, Your prince asks pity. Can you withhold that milk of the heart from your country's orphan? His hiding-place must not be knownâI have chosen the low caves. Bring Clare with you. I can trust my love. I await you at sunset. Margarito.â Clara. I cannot go. Why did you let me hear Of such a thing?âTreason! Iolante. You will not come? You've no response to that? False girl! Clara. False wife! Iolante. Markwald, my lord!âand, oh, Sicilia! And more than that a prince, and fugitive! Clara. Have others then no country and no bonds? If you forget your duty as a wife To gratify a young compatriot, Despise me not that simply I renounce A lover rather than forget my blood And all it binds me to. Beyond all this, I'm Markwald's sister, think before you thus Betray him. Iolante. I have thought: for in our life's Most sudden tempest there's the lightning-flash,â Torch of an instant!âall is seen and judged. I'll not betray my country; and my lord, My noble husband, will not be betray'd If to his wife I'm true.âYou will not come. A trust, remember. Do you love him, Clare? Clara. You then forget! Iolante. I see you will not come; You're sewing. [Exit. Clara. 'Tis a plot. That's treachery. I will not keep a traitor's confidence That is a snare under my people's feet. I'll write and send my German page to town; Sunset will not be here for seven hours. [Exit. Scene III. âEnter the Emperor and Celano. Celano. These letters state the bargain which my brain Hath struck with greedy Deathâthe written bonds That pledge full many lives to sudden tombs. Emperor. Let's see! I read elated.âMarkwald comes With knotted brow. He fears your subtility. [Enter Markwald.] Celano. He's for the battle-axe and honesty, No toils, no snares, no scaffold. Emperor. How now, Mark? Markwald. I have a paperâto be read aloudâ 'Tis from my sisterâsays: âThis very eve William and Margarito seek the cave Under our pines. Arrest them.â Emperor. Noble lass! Why look you so aghasted? We will find Among our Dukes a nobler groom by far Than this vile Admiral. Celano. Who's written this? [Snatching the letter. The Lady Iolante without doubt Knew of the secret and ... Markwald [moodily]. The hand is Clare's. I'm not a man for motives and surmiseâ Absolute blank, where I can learn no facts. And I beseech you, Sire, by all my sword Hath wrought for you, and by my loyalty Mine and my sister's, you impute no ill Where you can have no knowledge. I myself Arrest the traitors. Celano. You! Oh, pardon me. You are too heated. More, there is a pledge, An oath ta'en you should be justiciary In clearing off these treasons. Markwald. So I will. Go, search my houseâbring each to his account Of all within. Do not let one be spared. [Aside.] Oh!âIolante, I shall be your judge.â I must give orders. Lead me to my house. [He moves away tottering. Celano. Sybilla and her daughters are involved. Emperor. Let them be all confined. Markwald [returning]. Sybilla, Sire, Sicken'd for death when we removed her child. Doubtless the blow has stunn'd her; better leave That agÃ¨d creature in her miseryâ It's burning down to ash. Emperor. 'Twill be rare sport To stir the embers; the dull'd flames will hiss And crackle fierce, I warrant. Hither! [To Attendant. Markwald. Leave The crownless woman to die undisturb'd. Emperor. No words for rebels. Markwald. None. [Aside.] My heart is dead. [Exit Markwald Emperor. Peter, I like not this remorseful mood. [Walks about uneasily. Celano [busily turning over his letters]. My brain may rest: no need of forgery. In Clara's warning we've a real plot. Yet will I make it seem that all along I had instinctive knowledge of their schemes. And this my painful scribbling [putting back the letters in his breast] will avail To humble my Veronica. I'll keep These pretty running lines in which she's sold Her birthright as Sicilian. She is mine: The country I apportion her is Hellâ Confinement at my pleasure in its flames; With just a hope across the gulf to catch Sight of a paradise within my arms. [Aloud.] My lord, I must confess to you I feign'd Creative faculty: for full four days I have with diligence by piecemeal learnt All that is here devised. This note confirms My worst suspicions of Salerno's guilt. I set your childish fool a spy to watch The Archbishop, whom he hates for getting him Whipt 'fore the Court; and he reports the two Have constantly been closeted.âThe lad [The Emperor turns away with knitted brows. Will get revenged upon his enemy, But lose his playmate in the pretty prince He dotes on with a fool's capacity. It takes much science to secure revenge Without some personal discomfiture. [Aloud.] Salerno, Margarito, Markwald,âSire, You'll think I am suspiciousâwe must watch. Emperor. It's that old hag, Sybilla! Honest Mark Against the charms of discrown'd royalty Is scarcely proof; the boy must be immured Deep in an Alpine fortress; for the rest, Though he enrages me, I'll not withdraw My faith in him; he's German to the bone, [Enter Constantia.] As German as my fair Constantia here Is rank Sicilian. Give us leave awhile. Celano. I'll warn the guards and captains. [Exit. Emperor. This revolt I'll quell with iron heel within my house. The Lady Iolante has of late Been much about the Empress. Women here Breed thoughts as they were men. I'll put her back To her own woman's use.âHow now! in tears? You should not leave your rooms; your modesty Keeps you a pris'ner till you give a prince To me and to your country. Constantia. Sweet my lord, I've given her a prince imperial In you, and now, thus suppliant at your feet, Beseech you look upon my woman-land, Wild, ardent, dreaming, full of tenderness, As if she were Constantia! Comfort her, Assure her that the blood of her brave sons By you shall be held sacred as the life, Trembling within me, of your kingdom's heir. Emperor. Oh, pretty speeches! Have you practised them Among your girls? Such cunning eloquence Moves admiration. I will rule my wife By German custom: you shall breed me babes And wanton in the nursery: on days Of state you shall ride with me round the town, And what I will shall be your pleasure, if It be to sack Palermo. Once for all Leave policy and punishment to me. Constantia. You sworeâ You promised me, if I would yield my rights And be your wife, you would espouse my land And cherish her. Emperor. Ha, ha! A pretty wit! And I will keep my word. I govern you As I will govern your Sicilian land, Most absolutelyâyou're the stuff for it, Fickle and tender and irresolute. Constantia. The stuff for making slaves! You've chosen me A mother for your son. Emperor. To see him through His teething, set him on his legs, as soon As he can prattle I will tutor him. [A Messenger enters at the door.] You're for the swaddling clothes. ... Messenger. My liege, the lord Celano urgently implores you give Him instant conference. Emperor [turning to Constantia, raising and hastily kissing her]. Oh, then a kiss And pardon. [Exit with Messenger. Constantia. I have cursed him on the lips. Are men so mad to put into our hands Such arms against them as I carry sheath'd In my frail body's scabbard. I will bear A prince to Sicily; he shall be great And glorious the fervid southern way; My own despised Sicilian he shall woo, And as a bride be-jewel with his songs; His court shall be the splendour of the world, The sun of nations; men shall say of him, âConstantia was unfaithful to her spouse; He bears no impress of his German sire.â [Beating her breast.] Here, here, in closest privacy we'll hatch Our treasons, my unborn avenger, here Shall be conspiracy. Oh, I am weak Even to the mortal hour, yet mightier Than an earth-cov'ring host; for Motherhood, That ancient Power with rights mysterious, Won by fell Nature for her womankind, Receives my injuries. [Noise of arms without.] They're arming men;â My child, we'll leave them to their battle-fields; They may determine history; the fate Of nations we will settle, thou and I. [Exit. Scene IV. âA Cave. Enter Margarito and Prince William. Margarito. Boy, are you cold? Prince William. Why yes, my feet. Margarito. We'll walk. Take care of the rough stones. Prince William. How dark it is! So stiff and dark above our heads, I think The ground that roofs our graves must look like that When we are buried. Margarito. Nay, nay,ânot at all. The grave hath got no hole within its side. Prince William. It had one when they put the dead man in. I've seen itâa black hole. Margarito. And this is blueâ With what the sexton sees when in a grave, The sky! Cursed thought! I will not tell the boyâ Come, we will nearer to the entrance, so! I like not stifling fumes of underground. Lift me yon stone. Heroes have lifted such. That's bravely tried! [Enter Iolante.] Prince William. Mother! Margarito. Where is my love? Iolante. She's no Sicilian; do not look for her. Margarito. Iolante, you reproach me! Iolante. You divorce Me from my husband. It were easier Refuse a newly-orphan'd babe the breast, Than a sweet outcast prince my refuge-arms. Yet, Margarito, yet I never had One traitor thought. Why do you ruin me? Margarito. Oh, perfect image of Sicilia's self Guarding her child! Why that is naturalâ The cursÃ¨d German girl! Oh, the vile horde! Iolante. Now, my brave Markwald, were you here, that lie Were back i' the speaker's throat. I'll keep the child, Leave him to me. Margarito. You have no sympathy? Do you not say âGod-speedâ nor even âFarewell.â If Clare is false it may be all's betray'd; This our last meeting. IolanteâOh!â Have you no âAddioâ? Iolante. Heaven shield the right! Margarito. And me.âI am Sicilia's hope. Iolante. I feel All's lost. Oh, Margarito, haste thee, fly To Africa.âThou hast unlawful thoughts. Prince William. There's some one coming. Iolante. I'll defend the child. Margarito. Lost! They are arm'd. [Enter Markwald and Soldiers.] Markwald [aside]. A show of innocenceâ That child between them as a sword to make Dolts of my eyes. Ah, I have driven snow Over her wanton cheeks!âThey're traitors all. [To Soldiers.] Advance! Margarito. Stand! Markwald. Never trust Sicilian tongue He means no vain defence. Advance! [They engage. Margarito's sword is broken. Margarito. There cracks One of thy heart-strings, Freedom! [He is secured. Markwald [to a Soldier]. Let me pass. Soldier. I'm wounded. Markwald. Yes.âCaptain, secure them.âCome [to Iolante.] With me. I would not have you manacled. Iolante. Markwald, the boy is innocent. Markwald. And you? Iolante. Am ready for my punishment. You must Bear me away. I swoon. Margarito. Upon my soul, Her innocence is twice the child's. Markwald. You taint The wind, sir; not my ear. The prisons: on! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âPalermo. A Court of Justice. Enter Emperor, Markwald as Justiciary, Peter de Celano, Lords and Ladies, the Fool, the Archbishop of Salerno, Sybilla and her children, Iolante and Margarito attended. Markwald. The court is open. This revolt had wrought Destruction to our rule; ruin as swift Fall on the workers' heads! Our loyalty (That virtue gave Christ heart to be a King) Is lost. You, proud Archbishop, have been proved The root of this offence by witnesses That my authority may not impugn; And I condemn you to the death most meet For such desertâ Fool [to Celano]. Oh, hang him by the leg! Celano. His extreme haughtiness deserves reproof; He'd suffer none before him. Emperor. Put him last. Harness him to his courser's tail, and then, Fool, his remains shall be thy heritage; This the first property I've given thee. Archbishop [as he passes out to Celano]. I'd done the same by you, and may in Hell. [Exit attended. Markwald. For Queen Sybilla, she hath done no wrong. No: nor her daughters. Celano [to Emperor]. Do you mark that, sire? He'd win a gentle sentence for the queen To save his wife; he hesitates and doubts. Emperor. I note him: do not interpose. Markwald. Therefore Let her remain in mild imprisonment With her three daughters. For this kingdom's peace Young William must be guarded; it may be Prudent to keep him in an Alpine hold, Where lawless rebels may not penetrate To seize his person. Iolante [aside]. Oh, my lord turns pale! He loves the boy: my Markwald, what he bears! Emperor. Too lenient! Mine the usurper's child! And to no charge I'll yield him till he is A prince no man will fight for. Take him out. I will attend him. [Iolante faints. Markwald. See to her who faints.â Sire, from his mother's sight to pluck the child Thus roughly with such threatâ Emperor [pointing to Sybilla]. She does not faint. Mark you her glaring eye. Markwald. My liege, the guilt Lies not on that young head: it lies with those Who harbour'd him. I do beseech you, spare (You soon will be a father) the young prince. I shall not ask you mitigate your wrath When it lights true on the thrice-damnÃ¨d heads Of Margaritone and ... my wife. Emperor [to Celano]. Ha, ha! Celano, you judged wrong; let's wait to see How a true Teuton tramples down his heart 'Neath the mail'd heel of his conscience.âFor the boy, He's mine to crush. Sybilla. If you would shed his blood In my sight, that were a boon. O God, I feel The seeds of frenzy quick in me. Chains, chains For the wild beasts at my brain! God, call them off! I must keep wit for cursing. Lunacy Will eunuch my revenge. Emperor. Give her a cell. Keep in light bonds her daughters. [Exeunt, guarded. Markwald. Now we pass To other pris'ners. Margarito is The arch-conspirator, and has seduced A noble woman from her wifely faith. Let the slow fire consume him! Margarito. Merciful, To blazon forth my fate! I could not choose Death more significant. I fain would speak While the faggots pile; I have but two requests:â [The Emperor takes the forged letters from Celano; they talk apart.] That my heart be given Clara, my betroth'd,â The girl who set her country o'er her loveâ Look for it in the ashes; it will throb Laid in her faithful bosom. I applaud [Markwald shudders.] Her action, tho' it dooms me to my pyre; 'Tis mated by her nobleness, who snapped [Turning to Iolante.] For her country even a more sacred tie, And for Sicilia with rent bosom braved Taint of a word that kills her as unchaste, Iolanteâ Markwald. Let the fire consume your lips For playing with that name! Leave me to doom What of mine own is guilty. Lead him out To the red stake. [Exit Margarito and Guards.] Iolante, you must die. Iolante. Most willingly; bind me to that same pyre We both have merited. Markwald [furiously]. What, with him still! Is torture sweet with him to share it? No. You shall look on unhurt and see him die, The next day suffer. [To Emperor.] May I ask the block For her? The bitterness of death is past When she's seen the traitor blacken at the stake, For whom she brought dishonour on my house. Celano [aside to the Emperor]. Oh, it's a private grievance; never think He'd send her to the block, but for the shame Margaritone was her paramour. Emperor. Your private grief Heal, cauterize at will: for us we'd give Free pardon to so fair a miscreant. Nay, we make intercession:âprison her, After she's seen that fellow to his end, And give her time for penitence. Markwald. She dies. Iolante, will you speak? Have you requests? Iolante. My lord, you have done justly; I deserve, As a state-culprit, death. Mar not your deed By thought of private vengeance. Oh, believe, You offer a pure victim to your God, Or the sacrifice avails not.âPromise me I may have burial in your vault, the place That is my right: there, Markwald, you will come; We shall be reconciled. You cannot bear To be answer'd by a woman. I will lie Quite still, and you will call me by that name, Of which I have not lost the chrism-grace, WifeâIolante. Markwald. I dishonour not My ancestry with a dissever'd head. You shall not lie with them. Iolante. Then, sweet my lord, Let Sicilia take my body as my life; Her vilest ground is hallow'd. Fare ye well. Clara will comfort you; she suffers most. Don't tell her how Margaritone dies; She'll think all's ended.âI am ready quite To see the patriot lighted to his God; He whom I love I leave in torture here; My Markwald, Heaven grant you clearer sight! [Exit Iolante attended. Markwald. Is the Court over? Celano. The rebellion is Methinks pluck'd up by the roots. Markwald. 'Twas not to you I spoke. Tear up those damnÃ¨d forgÃ¨d lies. I thank my God they have condemn'd no man; Each has confess'd his treason: thine the vil'st, Who mix'd, dissembling, 'mong the wretched bands Fooling and cozening them,âand thine escapes. Emperor. Softly, good Mark! Celano serves me well. Iolanteâ Markwald. I've a boon to ask: none speak That name: remind a bastard of his birth Sooner than a dishonour'd man of her He has miscall'd his wife. There's much to do; The city is unquiet; I will set A guard at the southern gate. Emperor. Nay, Markwald, take Some rest! Markwald [looking back at the Emperor]. What rest? Rest in the lonely grave From which I've banished her? I'll keep the gate. [Exeunt. Scene II. âA Balcony overlooking Margarito's pyre. Celano [looking at Markwald, who is walking round it]. The fires are dying down. What's blasted him? Is it the bold of Heaven? Wounded pride? He's built on Henry's favour. Good my Mark, The Emp'ror shall disgrace you. God may scar, The royal woodsman sunders you at base. To-morrow, when my last great victim falls, My wedding-day, the triumph were complete Did not a rival's shadow cross the throne. [Enter the Emperor.] Emperor. Peter, it's out! No Teuton can withstand Sicilian arts! Markwald's been prowling round That pyre to see Justice on Henry's murderer?âthe bones Of a dead rival. He's for Tancred's line Hot as was Margarito. There he stood And blubber'd like a baby. I recall His words, âThe deed is devilish; you blind The child, but not men's judgments, seeing eyes Condemn your deed.ââI'd have such eyes put out. Imperial policy. ... [The Fool bursts in.] Fool, are you crazed? Is the Archbishop hanging by the leg? Fool. It is not that. Lord Markwald set me on To watch it all.â The pretty lady Iolante stood So white and cold against the flame. I ran To play wi' the little prince, but others came Gave him hot sport. Celano. Your folly's lost its wits. Poor fool, you've miss'd The jangle of your bells these last twelve hours. Fool [to the Emperor]. I am a boy; master, be merciful. Emperor. You shall be whipt, till you cry out yourself For mercy. [To Attendants.] Get him flogg'd. A fool implores Mercy for such. [Exeunt Attendants with Fool.] My anger is confirm'd. I tell you, Markwald is remorseful now For kindling those spent faggots. As they bore Sybilla to her cell, a cry was heard: âMarkwald, my boy's grim father, you'll revenge.â He breathed deep in reply. Celano. Has anything, My liege, miscarried that I undertook? To-morrow Iolante dies: he waits To see her pass;âthe State dispenses with His ocular aid henceforward. What, you start! We'll merely blind him, for his sympathy With those dead rebels; 'mong the ruins there. He's dangerous; a bandage for the eyes Secures his loyalty, so saves his life. I would not have you doom him to the block For sake of ancient service. Yet a word, My liege; I craved an audience to ask A private favour of you. Will you deign Visit my house to-morrow? No more blood. We'll give you change from this grim festival, The scaffold's; to my bride Veronica I will conduct you. Emperor. You have had enough Of these cursed marriages. Celano. Veronica Must be subdued ere the rebellion end. I marry her and thenâ Emperor. Well, you've the brain. I owe you much, and you shall have your whim. [Exit. [Enter Veronica.] Celano. Veronicaâand frozen to the scent. She'll never drop her leaves for misery Like the little fool Azaire. A perfect pride! And not one stone Left on another, when the world again Looks toward the edifice!âAlas, how few The moments we can give to love. You're pale. Veronica. We wed to-night? To-morrow to the king You will present me? Celano. Yes, I sent you word The marriage would not be before the Court, The king has so scant leisure; yet he greets My bride the first day of her state. Veronica. The priest Stays for you at the altar, with the friends I've brought to witness it. Celano. You're poorly clad In this white gown. Veronica. Could I look more beautiful? I thought not when the mirror faced me. Celano. True. A touch of humbleness would perfect you. Must Beauty always grow on pride's stiff stalk? You are impatient; but I am not dress'd As bridegroom. Stay awhile; I'll come for you In the dove-colour'd robe. [Exit Celano. Veronica [looking out wildly]. The fire is dead; It leaps not to reproach me. I am hard, I have no pity; I am only glad As it had ceased to lighten in the sky Because the thunder flutters me. It's still. I am at last about to be his wife (There's terror in it, in my only hope!) The blue eyes that he's borrow'd fascinate; They're borrow'd for my wedding. Andrea Had that cold glanceâI thought youth's chastity Till he look'd down on wreck'd Veronica Aloof and critical. [Re-enter Celano.] Celano. This hand is ice Within my fingers. Veronica. But the wedding-ring Will give it warmth, my lord. The priest attends. [Exeunt. Scene III. âA Cell. Iolante and Gaoler. Iolante. At ten i' the morningâwhen the day has pass'd Its early youth and looks as old as I? You will be there? Gaoler. Your lord will see you pass. Iolante. Lord Markwald! Gaoler. Doom'd for clear disloyalty; They found him raking out the traitors' ash. Iolante. Is he to die? Gaoler. They'll blind him, when he's used His eyes to-morrow; 'tis his own desire To keep 'em till he's seen all have their due. Iolante. Would I might be his executioner! Gaoler. Lady, you have no fear; there's some of us Will use him roughly. Iolante. You have been my friend. Now listen; try to understand; he judged Us rightly. I was a conspirator; Margaritone was of blacker dye; He kill'd us for his country; but he loved. He cannot over-live us. See he die. Gaoler. Sweet ladyâ Iolante. Is he not your countryman? You Germans do not falter. For his landâ He served it to the sev'ring of his heart; But do not doubt he loves Sicilia well, And therefore must he die.âOh, see it done! Touch not his eyes till his o'erstrainÃ¨d soul Break from its prison. Gaoler. Nay, I promise you. I have authority. [Exit. Iolante. Then now to sleep For this one night alone. [Lies down on a pallet and sleeps. Scene IV. âA Street in Palermo. Enter Markwald and Warders. 1st Warder. We'll stand in the shadow o' the wall; 'tis a hot sun. 2nd Warder. Good sir, we pause.âHe might be walking in his sleep. 3rd Warder. After a manner 'twill be always so when he's got no sight. Poor gentleman!âan' I so timid at darkness, 'cause of ghosts an' foul dreams. An' there's no cock-crow to his sort o' sleep; till the last trump. All darkâ night, day, an' the grave. 2nd Warder. Do you dream ill? 3rd Warder. 'Till I scream like a houseless cat at midnight. I dreamt last night of a bloody gibbet, an' the devils making their tongues red. My wife says 'tis the wine; but I hold 'tis my kind o' head. 1st Warder. Saints be thank'd! I'm sober in my sleep. Stop, sir, don't stumble; here is better shade. Markwald. The sun is cover'd by yon dome. Bright Heaven, I'll make my own eclipse! 2nd Warder. But just in time. Look outâ [A procession begins to appear.] Poor soul! Markwald. The axe!â It points not to my heart.âThe other way! And thereâ [Enter Iolante attended.] Why did they let her dress herself in white? No matter. She is nothing.âWould these windows Were broken into shivers! [To Warders.] Pleasant shade! Iolante [kissing his eyes]. Alas, they have been ever blinded. See! Thy Iolante, going to her Judge, Dares thus, with blessÃ¨d wifely privilege, To kiss them. Markwald. Surely these are faithful lips That press so firmly; little constant lips That have not said what's wicked. Iolante. Never, never! Markwald. They'll leave me the poor lids that you have kiss'd, Light of my eyes! Iolante. Tho' everything is dark, I'll see for you from Heav'n. Markwald. God bless you. Headsman. Lady, We wait no longer. Markwald. Iolanteâwife! [Exeunt Iolante and procession. These hateful eyes, like lights above the marsh, Misled my love. Oh, take me to the place Where I can get them quench'd.âAy, there's the flow'r That, when I pinch'd her mouth into a pout, She mimick'd and she call'd it Snapdragon. 3rd Warder. Here, shove me with your shoulder an' I'll pick it from the wall. Thenâmarch! [Exeunt. Scene V. âA lordly Room. Veronica before a mirror, superbly dressed. Enter Celano at a distance. Celano. There are dark lines round her eyes; she's won her goal. She says she is my wife. 'Tis manifest She loves me; I shall see now if she'll bear Disgrace with me,âor if it be the name She sought but to recover.âWhy not wear That string of pearls I deck'd you with last night? Veronica. Will you not put it on? [Gives him the pearls. As he clasps the necklace, a tear falls on his hand.] Celano. D' you give me liquid pearls? I ask no price For my necklace; 'tis a gift. Veronica. Why, so am I, Celano; I have given you myself, Body and soul:âthere is a look in your eyes As you had bought a slave-girl. Celano. I have pride In my most rare possession: lift your eyes, We need their sapphireâor the marble cheek Repels from kissing. See the king attends! [Enter Emperor and train.] Do I not give you state? That haggard brow!â Fie on you for a bride! Veronica. Oh, mock me not! Celano. My liege, it is a strain of courtesy To pay us bridal honours, while the town Is still unsettled, from the cares of state Sparing an hour to taste your subject's joy. Emperor. Sweet lady, by my royalty, I'm glad Faithful Celano hath so fair a wife. Had you been found my enemyâ Celano. Perchance I may bespeak a place for her beside The queen, reward for her meek loyalty [In low voice to Emperor. And frankness; she has scrupled not, my liege, To lend her hand to the creative work Of the forged letters. Ay, a goodly hand That will not blush at falsehood. [Presses it.] Does it hurt, This wedding-ring? You wince. I'll take it off. Veronica. Leave jesting. [Aside.] God, what part am I to play! There's the very look in all that crowd of eyes I saw when they degraded the wrong'd priest. Emperor. My queen needs tendance, for her hope is soon To give my lands an heir. Veronica. Most joyfully I shall attend her Highness. Celano. Heaven grant Your hopes prosperity. Wilt please you pass Where my poor bridal off'rings are set forth; My bride exacts such homage. [Leads Veronica to a table richly laden with jewelled cups, fair array, etc.] Ah, a thing Of ancient admirationâcoveted How long, that cross of lapis lazuli? Veronica [not heeding him]. God! Andrea's first gift, torn from my neck, When ... I'm his wife, he'll not dishonour me: [aloud] I like the fashion of this cupâ'tis well. My liege, what think you of it? Celano. All this while You're speaking in a tongue that irks the king. Discourse to him in German. Veronica. That must be As my lord finds teachers. Celano. Oh, I've thought of that; And to begin with, there's a German girl I've chosen to attend you, with regard To accent. [To Servant.] Will you summon Madeleine? [Madeleine enters, with a child in her arms.] Veronica [glancing at her]. My lord, what is 't you do? Some paramour Brought to insult me?âOh, oh! Celano. Madeleine, Defend yourself, declaring who you are. Madeleine. I am his wife, and this his lawful child. Celano. Truth, girl! And this my mistress. [Pointing to Veronica, standing superb among her jewels. Veronica [clutching a small jewelled dagger and stabbing Madeleine]. Now your wife. [Falls senseless. Celano. Look to the babe; it is my lawful son; Heaven grant it be not hurt! Veronica, We'd lived in lawless love, my peerless one; I never would have banish'd thee. Servants. Alack, The babe is dead. Celano. What, kill'dâmy young Azaire! Murd'ress, 'tis you who crush'd it, and she's slain. I'm baulk'd. Do you think I want your services, You maudlin wretch? Hence, blundererâyour hire! [Re-stabs Madeleine. Adheld [pointing to Veronica]. Now she's not here to chide me, I'll avenge. Her prayers delay'd this tragedy. [Stabs Celano. Celano. Well done! Adheld, it would have been More Roman to have bid you hold my sword While I fell on it. One thing I command, You close my eyes now shuddering from light, And, pardon'd by your murder'd master, live My faultless squire. [Dies. Adheld. Oh, kill me from his sight! [Turning to Veronica.] But Heaven! She wakes. Veronica. Bring me my husband, quick. Adheld. Alack, sweet lady, he is dead. Veronica. Oh, then I am his widow; see they bury us In the Cistercian Chapel side by side. [Dies. Emperor. O dignity superb! [To Adheld] Of the dead pardon that accords you life We'll reap the profit: let your tongue give clue To this dire tragedy. What drew your lord, A man whose nature was not of the clime Where tears are foster'd, to sob o'er that babe, And with such fury pierce your sister's heart? Celano, your domestic policy Is grim and dull. Why did he stumble thus? Adheld. My liege, his one thought betwixt state affairs Was of this lady [turning trembling to Veronica]; her he dearly loved, Loved vainly as a boyâwas spurn'd; he found His younger brother, since a monk, had won Her secret love, and vow'd to publish it. The lady then entreated him to wed And shield her; but he fear'd she sought his name, Indifferent to his love. [Enter Messenger.] Emperor. Who seeks us thus? Messenger. Markwald is dead. As they were blinding him, He fell upon his torturers and used Their instrumentsânot to put out his eyes, But, as he said, his life. Emperor. Markwald is dead! It was a threat. Messenger. The order was most strict. Emperor. Celano, ah, I fear 'twas jealousy! You would have been the highest in my love; To you I owe my kingdom. [Enter an Old Woman.] Old Woman. O my liege, You have a son. Emperor. Now by my fatherhood, I feel the clue To this dark maze. Celano, your dead son Shall have a tomb next to the solemn vault Where majesty is laid. My lords, away; This is no fitting chamber for the news Of the queen's blest deliv'rance. Let us go Greet our young prince. [Exeunt all but Adheld. Adheld. Now I may close her eyes. Scene VI. âA Chapel. Midnight. Veronica and Celano, superbly dressed, on biers. Moonlight falls on the floor of the Chapel. In the distance by the dimly-lighted altar Monks are chanting; they approach. A few remain grouped round the bier; the rest retire. 1st Monk [to a brother who rises from his knees]. Thou hast not wander'd from thy pray'rs? 2nd Monk. But once, To see the soul for whom I sought release. 3rd Monk. They say she is not the true lawful wife. She had a fearful pride; the Emperor Was smitten with her beauty, and allows This stately burial as she were his bride. 2nd Monk. A mighty temptress! By St. Benedict, I had to shut my eyes to pray for her; Satan is in me yet. 1st Monk. The funeral Is to be full of pomp. 2nd Monk. She should have been Herself the Empress; she's imperial; Her brow a crown, and her thrice-coilÃ¨d hair A tiara of gold; her hand Is Venus-white, half azure from the sea. 1st Monk. She's but a comely woman, touch her not; The image is profane. 3rd Monk [to 2nd Monk]. Your watch is o'er. 1st Monk. Take no farewells; but go and scourge yourself. This is a sinner's corpse. 2nd Monk. 'Tis beauty's shrine. 3rd Monk. She died, they say, of stifled jealousy As 'twere by her own hand: she's in the flame. 2nd Monk. Oh, happy to encircle her! In hell There must be rare encounters. I will go. [Enter Andrea.] Andrea. You all of you may rest. I'll watch and pray, And guard the dead till midnight; then, return! [Exeunt Monks, carefully veiling the corpse. To be again alone with her; in truth She has protection in her husband,âah, Death now has forced him join a brotherhood Denied all earthly pleasure: ne'er again He swore should I behold this blessÃ¨d one, And now, so she is gracious to my suit, My fasting lips shall banquet on her cheeks While he lies there unfeasted. [Touching the grave-clothes.] How the folds In shimmering creases fall upon her breast, I dare not touch them. 'Tis as when I climb'd The trellis to her room: she lay within, So solemn in repose, so beautiful, I held my breath and worshipp'd. Suddenly She waked,âah, God, if she had been afraid, Entreated me to leave her,âbut she smiled, And as a queen bow'd o'er me in embrace. I dare not lift this cover [grasping the cover on her face]; I might meet Repulse; the dead can look forbiddingly; I had forgotten she is lying dead, And I must pray for her ... Oh, presently. But first I'll see they've laid God's image on her breast, And kissâthe crucifix; then spread the cloth 'Twixt me and her and get me to my pray'rs. [He draws aside the face-cloth and passionately kisses her. Oh, Christ! And you are buried as his wife? Mine, mine! Receive me! [He falls in a swoon on the body, and dies. [After a long pause re-enter Monks and their Superior.] 1st Monk. How's this? The devil hath been tempting him. 3rd Monk. He's push'd aside the cross; he's in a swoon. 2nd Monk. Methinks the face looks softer. Can it be The lady hath revived? 1st Monk [turning the face of Andrea to the moonlight]. Poor soul, he's gone. 2nd Monk. See! he has caught her hand, the ring hath slipp'd. All. Most wonderful! 2nd Monk. Good father, do you note? Superior. Too young, too young our brother was to watch. He to his Church, his spiritual land, Hath been disloyal, cleaving to his love. All. We shall be charm'd unless we fly the place, EntrancÃ¨d by the devil. Superior. He is lost. Fetch a low bier; and lay him at her feet. Chant soft as ye retire to cleanse the air. [Exeunt solemnly chanting. Scene VII. âOutside the Walls of Palerno. A desolate country, strewn with bones and ashes; Clara sitting by a mound. Enter Sybilla. Sybilla. He broke from meâthe wild fantastic lad. I'll sit down on the refuse. That's a grave! Are you not smiling there? A pretty mound Of flow'rs and my boy's body safe beneath, With no more cruel torturer than the worms. Oh, I would rest beside it and laugh so!â Like the fool.âHe's in the Alps, Blind, mutilate, and motherless, The man-child of my womb. If they'd give him me To finish the wild work, so one by one I'd pluck the senses out! He should not hear. You'll find the scars of his shrieks about my heartâ Nor touch with seeking hands. I'd bury him Wholly alive. What are you doing there? Clara. They cast the ashes here; I pick them up. They say full fifty men were burn'd alive; There are bones too ... and trinkets. Sybilla. Burnt to clear ash! What all the misery? Go, score your brow with them and comfort you. Is it possible to turn fine gold to dross, Degrading nature? Clara. I deliver'd him To justice,âhe was treasonous. I loved My country. ... Sybilla. You're that German girl who brought The patriot Margaritone, thus To dust?âthe harlot! Clara. Here are double rings,â One black and rusty, but I recognisedâ They're our betrothal rings. I am his bride. You speak the truth to call him patriot; He died for his country. Oh, thou widow'd land, Thou art sad for him, thou hast large space to mourn; Poor little Clara with her cÃ²nfined heart Dare not receive such sorrow.âAfter death, Friends go away; one comes to wash the corse; There's in me that fidelity to cleanse The death-sweat from the brow, prop up the chin, Set the lips straight for kisses. Things being thus, I stay To cover up the ashes. I shall wait Till the vine smothers up the spot, and then, When the last offices are done, I'll go And die in my own land. [Burying some ashes. [Enter Fool.] Fool. Come away, mother,âmother, come away, My folly's gone from me, my childishness. I'm the little prince, your sonâin motley too To make you laughâthe Prince! Just see me dance. Mother, I'll make you fool first, then I'll go And pray for you in a convent. Don't you stand To see them burn. ... Mother, they took the fool, A boy too like myselfâyou must not seeâ After they blinded him, I stole his cap And little motley coatâ To dance before you that you may not see; And the bells, bells; mother, listen! Clara. Are you a queen? Have you escaped from hard captivity? Sybilla. I am a queen. Oh, you say wisely, you Vile doggish creature, snuffing at the grave Of your dead heroâverily a queen. I came here for the airâthe sweet soft smell, Like violets, of my Sicilia's corse. Fool. Lady, I brought her here, for she cried for the country; 'tis a jest, for the country is the fields and the scaffold. Margarito asked for his country and they gave him a bundle of sticks. I take the lady to the green fields. Come away, mother, to the fields! For the country is where it's green all day, And cannot be where it's red; The country is where it's green all day, And so still, because one's dead. To the country, come!</field>
