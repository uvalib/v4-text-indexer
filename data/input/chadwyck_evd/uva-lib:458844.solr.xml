      <field name="fulltext">Actus I. Scœna I. Enter Homer. Since moderne Authors, moderne things haue trac't, Serching our Chronicles from end to end, And all knowne Histories haue long bene grac't, Bootlesse it were in them our time to spend To iterate tales oftentimes told ore, Or subiects handled by each common pen; In which euen they that can but read (no more) Can poynt before we speake, how, where, and when We haue no purpose: Homer old and blinde, Of eld, by the best iudgements tearm'd diuine, That in his former labours found you kinde, Is come the ruder censures to refine: And to vnlocke the Casket long time shut. Of which none but the learned keepe the key. Where the rich Iewell (Poësie) was put. She that first search't the Heauens, Earth, Ayre, and Sea. We therefore begge, that since so many eyes, And seuerall iudging wits must taste our stile, The learn'd will grace, the ruder not despise: Since what we do, we for their vse compile. Why should not Homer, bee that caught in Greece, Vnto this iudging Nation lend like skill. And into England bring that golden Fleece, For which his country is renowned still. The Golden past, The Siluer age begins In Iupiter, whose sonne of Danae borne, We first present, and how Acrisius sinnes Were punish't for his cruelty and scorne. We enter where we left, and so proceed, (Your fauour still, for that must helpe at need) Alarme. Enter with victory, K. Pretus, Bellerephon, bringing in K. Acrisius prisoner, drum and colours. Pretus. Now you that trusted to your Darreine strength, The brazen to wer that earst inclos'd thy childe, Stand'st at our grace, a captiue, and we now Are Arges King, where thou vsurp'st so late. Acrisius. Tis not thy power King Pretus, but our rigor Against my daughter, and the Prince her sonne, (Thus punish't by the heauens) haue made thee victor. Pretus. Twas by thy valor, braue Bellerephon, That took'st Acrisius prisoner hand to hand. Beller. The duty of a seruice and a seruant I haue exprest to Pretus. Pretus. By thy valor. We reigne sole King of Arges, where our brother Hath tyrannis'd, and now these brazen walles, Built to inmure a faire and innocent maide, Shall be thine owne Iayle. Gyue his legges in Irons, Till we determine further of his death. Acrisius. Oh Danae, when I rude and pittilesse Threw thee with thy yong infant, to the mercy Of the rough billowes, in a mastlesse boat, I then incur'd this vengeance. Iupiter, Whose father in those blest and happy dayes I scorn'd to be, or ranke him in my line, Hath chastis'd me for my harsh cruelty. Pretus. We are Ioues rod, and we will execute The doome of heauen with all seuerity: Such mercy as thy guardiant Beldams had, (Who for the loue of Danae felt the fire) Thou shalt receiue from vs. Away with him: Acrisius is led bound, and enters Q. Aurea. Aur. Why doth K. Pretus lead his brother bound, And keepe a greater foe in liberty? This, this, thou most vnchast Bellerephon, And canst thou blushlesse gaze me in the face? Whom thou so lately didst attempt to force, Or front the Prince thy maister with such impudence, Whose reuerent bed thou hast practis'd to defile. Beller. Madame, my Lord. Aurea. Heare not th'adulterers tongue, Who though he had not power to charme mine eares, Yet may inchaunt thine. Pretus. Beauteous Aurea, If I can proue by witnesse that rude practise, His life and tortures Il'e commit to thee. Aurea. What greater witnesse then Q. Aurea's teares? Or why should I hate you Bellerephon, That (saue this practise) neuer did me wrong? Beller. Oh woman, when thou art giuen vp to sin And shamelesse lusts, what brazen impudence, Hardens thy brow? Aurea. Shall I haue right of him? Pret. Thou shalt: yet let me tell my Aurea: This knight hath seru'd me from his infancy, Beene partner of my breast and secret thoughts. His sword hath beene the guardian of my state, And by the vertue of his strong right hand, I am possest of Arges. I could reade thee A Chronicle of his great seruices Fresh in my thoughts, then giue me leaue to pause, Ere I pronounce sad sentence of his death. Aurea. Grant me my L. but a few priuate words With this dissembling hypocrite: Il'e tell him Such instance of his heynous enterprise, Shall make him blush, and with efeminate teares, Publish his riotous wrongs against your bed. Pretus. We grant you priuacy. Aurea. Neare vs Bellerophon. Beller. Oh woman, woman. Aurea. We are alone, yet wilt thou grant me loue, Put me in hope, and say the time may come, And my excuse to Pretus shall vnsay, These loud exclaimes, and blanch this Æthiop scandall, As white as is thy natiue innocence: Loue mee, oh loue mee, my Bellerophon I sigh for thee, I mourne, I die for thee, Giue me an answere swift and peremptory; Gaine by thy grant, life; thy deniall, death. Wilt thou take time and limite mee some hope By pointing me an houre? Belleroph, Neuer, oh neuer. First shall the Sun-god in the Ocean quench, The daies bright fire, and o're the face of heauen Spread euerlasting darknesse. Aurea. Say no more. Dogge, deuill, euen before my husbands face Darst court me, Pretus canst thou suffer this? Iniurious Traytor, think'st thou my chast innocence, Is to bee mou'd with praiers, or brib'd by promises? Hath the King hir'd thee to corrupt this bed? Or is he of that slauish sufferance, Before his face to see nice strumpeted? Pretus, by heauen, and all the Gods I vow, To abiure thy presence, and confine my selfe To lasting widdow-hood, vnlesse with rigor Thou chastice this false groome. Pretus. Bellerophon Thou hast presum'd too much vpon our loue, And made too slight account of our high power In which thy life or death is circumscrib'd. Beller. My Lord, I should transgresse a Subiects duty, To lay the least grosse imputation Vpon the Queene, my beauteous Soueraintesse, And rather then to question her chaste vertues I laie my selfe ope to the strictest doome, My seruice hath bene yours, so shall my life, I yeeld it to you freely. Pretus. Aureas teares, Contend with thy supposed innocence And haue the vpper hand: to see thee die My setled loue will not endure: but worse Then death can bee, we doome thy insolence; Go hence an exile, and returne no more Vpon thy Knight-hood, but expose thy selfe Vnto that monstrous beast of Cicily, Cal'd the Chimera, t'hath a Lyons head, Goats belly, and a poysonous Dragons traine. Fight with that beast, whom Hoasts cannot withstand, And feede, what Armies cannot satisfie. My doom's irreuocable. Beller. For all my seruice A faire reward, but by my innocence, Vertues, and all my honours attributes, That sauadge Monster I will feede, or foile, Die by his iawes, or bring home honoured spoile. Aurea. Yet, yet, thy body meedes a better graue, And kill not mee too, whom thy grant may saue. Beller. A thousand fierce Chimerae's first I'le feede, Ere staine mine honour with that damned deed. Aurea. Againe to tempt me, hence base traytor flie, And as thy guilt's meede, by that monster die. Pretus. Away with him, 'tis our milde sufferance Begets this impudence, come beauteous Aurea Thou shalt bee full reuengde, I know him honourable In this, and will performe that enterprise Which in one death brings many: let vs now Inioy our conquests, hee shall soone bee dead, That with base sleights sought to corrupt our bed. Enter Perseus, Andromeda, and Danaus. Perseus. There stay our swift and winged Pegasus, And on the flowers of this faire Medow grase, Thou that first flewst out of the Gorgons bloud, Whose head wee by Mineruaes aide par'd off, And since haue fixt it on our Christall sheild. This head that had the power to change to stone, All that durst gaze vpon't; and being plac't here Retaines that power to whom it is vncas'd: Hath chandge great Atlas to a Mount so high, That with his shoulders hee supports the skie. Dana. Perseus, great sonne of Ioue and Danae. Famous for your atchieuements through the world Mineruaes fauorite, Goddesse of Wisedome, And husband of the sweete Andromeda. Whom you so late from the Sea-monster freed, After so many deedes of Fame and Honour, Shall we returne to see our mother Danae? Perseus. Deere brother Danaus, the renowned issue Of King Pellonus that in Naples raignes, Where beauteous Danae is created Queene, Thither I'le beare the faire Andromeda To see our Princely mother. Andro. Royall Perseus, Truely descended from the line of Gods, Since by the slaughter of that monstrous Whale, You freed me from that rocke where I was fixt To be deuoured and made the Monsters prey, And after wonne me from a thousand hands By Phineus arme, that was my first betroathed, Ingrate were I your fellowship to shunne, Whom by the force of Armes you twice haue won. Enter Bellerephon. Perseus. Towards Naples then, but soft, what Knight's that So passionately deiect? Let vs Salute him, Whence are you gentle Knight? Beller. I am of Arges. Perseus. But your aduenture? Beller. The infernall Monster, Cal'd the Chimera bred in Cicily. Perseus. Thou canst not stake thy life against such oddes, And not be generously deriu'd, I Perseus The sonne of Ioue and Danae, offer thee Assistance to this noble enterprise. Beller. Are you the noble Perseus, whom the world Crownes with such praise and royall hardinesse? Fam'd for your winged steed, and your Gorgons sheild, And for release of faire Andromeda? Pers. Wee Perseus are, and this Andromeda, King Cepheus daughter, rescued by our sword, The keene-edged harpe. Beller. Let me do you honours Worthy your State, and tell such newes withall As shall disturbe the quiet of your thoughts, I am of Arges where Acrisius raigned. Pers. Our Grand-sire, and raignes still. Beller. His brother Pretus Hath cast him both from stile and kingdome too, Nor let Bellerephon himselfe belie, It was by vertue of this strong right arme Which he hath thus requited, to expose me Vnto this strange aduenture, the full circumstance I shall relate at leasure, Pers. Dares King Pretus Depose Acrisius, knowing Perseus liues? Guide me faire Knight vnto my place of birth, Where the great King of Arges liues captiu'd, That I may glaze my harpe in the bloud Of Tyrant Pretus. Beller. I am sworne by oath To dare the rude Cycilian Monster first, Whom hauing slaine, I'le guide you to the rescue Of K. Acrisius. Perseus. Thou hast fir'd our bloud, And startled all our spirits Bellerephon, Wee'l mount our Pegasus, and through the ayre Beare thee, vnto that fell Chimeraes den: And in the slaughter of that monstrous beast Assist thy valour. Thence to Arges flye, Where by our sword th'vsurper next must dye. Beller. We are proud of your assistance, and withall Assur'd of Conquest. Perseus. Faire Andromeda, Danaus shall be your guardiant towards Arges, Where after this atchieuement we will meet, To giue our grand-sire freedome. Come, lets part, We through the ayre, you towards Darreine towre, Where Tragicke ruine Pretus shall deuoure. Exeunt. Enter K. Pretus, and Q. Aurea. Pretus. Aurea, we were too hasty in our doome, To loose that knight, whose arme protected vs, Whose fame kept all our neighbour Kings in awe: Nor was our state confirm'd, but in his life. Aurea. Let Traitors perish, and their plots decay, And we still by diuine assistance sway. Pretus. But say some Prince should plot Acrisius rescue, Inuade great Arges, or siege Darreine tower, Then should we wish Bellerephon againe, To expose their fury, and their pride restraine. Aurea. To cut off all these feares, cut off Acrisius, Appeare to him a brother full as mercilesse As he a cruell father, to his childe, The beauteous Danae and her infant sonne. Pretus. Onely his ruine must secure our state, And he shall dye to cut off future claime Vnto this populous kingdome we enioy. Our guard, command our captiue brother hither. Whom we this day must sentence. Oh Bellerephon! Thy wrongs I halfe suspect thy doome: Repent, Since all thy acts proclaime thee innocent. Guar. Behold the King your brother. Pretus. We thus sentence Acrisius brought in by the guard. Thy life Acrisius, thou that hadst the heart To thrust thy childe into a mastlesse boate; With a faire hopefull Prince, vnto the fury And rage of the remorslesse windes and waues: To doome these innocent Ladies to the fire, That were her faultlesse guardians; the like sentence Receiue from vs: We doome thee imminent death Without delay or pause. Beare to the blocke The tyrant, he that could not vse his raigne With clemency, we thus his rage restraine. Acris. Thou shew'st thy selfe in rigor pittifull, And full of mercy in thy cruelty, To take away that life, which to enioy Were many deaths, hauing my Danae lost With her sonne Perseus: hauing lost my kingdome, All through the vaine feares of Prophetike spelles: Why should I wish a wretched life to saue, That may rest happy in a peacefull graue? Pre. What shout is that? the proiect? A flourish and a shout. Enter a gentleman. Gentl. Strange and admirable. Bellerephon and a braue strange knight, Both crownd in bloud in the Chimeraes spoyle, Haue cleft the ayre on a swift winged steede, And in your Court alighted; both their swords Bath'd in the Serpents bloud, they brandish still, As if they yet some monster had to kill. Pretus. Bellerephon return'd? Thou hast amaz'd vs. Enter Perseus Danaus, and Bellerophon, with Andromeda. Kill Pretus and Aurea, beat away the rest of the guard. Perseus. One monster (then the rude Chimere more fell) That's Pretus, Danaes soone must send to hell. Pretus. Treason. Our guard. Perseus. Liues there a man, the tyrant Pretus dead, Saith that the Crowne shall not inuest his head? All. We all stand for the King Acrisius. Pers. Then by his generall sufferage once more raigne, Since by our hand th'vsurper here lyes slaine. Acrisius. Our hopelesse life, and new inuested state, Strikes not so deepe into Acrisius ioyes, As when he heares the name of Danaes sonne. Liues Danae? Perseus. Grand-sire, thy faire daughter liues A potent Queene: we Perseus are her sonne, This Danaus your hopefull grand-childe too: Nor let me quite forget Andromeda, By Perseus sword freed from the huge Sea-whale, And now ingraft into your royall line. Acris. Diuide my soule amongst you, and impart My life, my state, my kingdome, and my heart. Oh had I Danae here, my ioyes to fill, I truely then should be immortalis'd. Renowned Perseus, Danaus inly deere, And you bright Lady, faire Andromeda, You are to me a stronger sort of ioy Then Darreines brasse, which no siege can destroy. Dana. My gran-sires sight doth promise as much blisse, As can Elisium, or those pleasant fields, Where the blest soules inhabite. Andro. You are to me As life on earth, in death eternity. Acrisius. Let none presume our purpose to controwle: For our decree is like the doome of Gods Fixt and vnchanging: Perseus we create Great Arges King, crown'd with this wreath of state. Perseus. With like applause, and sufferage shall be seene, The faire Andromeda crown'd Arges Queene. Acrisius. Onely the Darreine tower I still reserue In that to pennance me a life retir'd, And I in that shall proue the Oracle. Faire Danaes sonne instated in my throne, Shall thus confine me to an Arch of stone. There will I liue, attended by my guard, And leaue to thee the manadge of my Realme. Our will is law, which none that beares vs well, Will striue by word or action to refell. Pers. The Gods behest with your resolue agree To increase in vs this growing maiesty. Bellerephon, we make thee next our selfe Of state in Arges: Danaus you shall hence, To cheere our mother in these glad reports, And to succeed Pelonnus: but first stay, Rights due to vs ere we the state can sway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus 2. Scœna. 1. Homer. Alacke! earths ioyes are but short-liu'd, and last But like a puffe of breath which (thus) is past. Acrisius in his fortresse liues retir'd, Kept with a strong guard: Perseus reignes sole King, Who in himselfe one sad night long desir'd To see his grand-sire some gladnewes to bring, Whom the stearne warders (in the night) vnknowne, Seeke to keepe backe, whence all his griefe is growne. A dumbe shew. Enter 6 warders, “to them Perseus, Danaus, Bellerephon and Andromeda. Perseus takes his leaue of them to go towards the tower: the warders repulse him, he drawes his sword. In the tumult enter Acrisius to pacifie them, and in the hurly-burly is slaine by Perseus, who laments his death. To them Bellerephon and the rest: Perseus makes Bellerephon King of Arges, and with Danaus and Andromeda departs. Homer. Perseus repulst, the stardy Warder strikes, This breeds a tumult, out their weapons flye, Acrisius heares their clamours and their shrikes, And downe descends this broyle to pacifie; Not knowing whence it growes: and in this brall, Acrisius by his grand-childes hand doth fall. The Oracle's fulfil'd, hee's turn'd to stone, That's to his marble graue, by Danaes sonne; Which in the Prince breeds such lament and mone, That longer there to reigne hee'l not be wonne: But first Bellerephon he will inuest, And after makes his trauels towards the East. Of Iupiter now deifi'd and made Supreme of all the Gods, we next proceed: Your suppositions now must lend us ayd, That he can all things (as a God indeed.) Our sceane is Thebes: here faire Alcmena dwels, Her husband in his warfare thriues abroad, And by his chiualry his foes expels. He absent, now descends th'Olimpicke God, Innamored of Alcmena, and trans-shapes Himselfe into her husband: Ganimed He makes assistant in his amorous rapes, Whil'st he preferres the earth 'fore Iunoes bed. Lend vs your wonted patience without scorne, To finde how Hercules was got and borne. Enter Amphitrio with two Captaines and Socia with drum and colours: hee brings in the head of a crowned King, sweares the Lords to the obeysance of Thebes. They present him with a standing bowle, which hee lockes in a Casket, and sending his man with a letter before to his wife, with news of his victory. He with his followers, and Blepharo the maister of the ship, marcheth after. Homer. Creon that now reignes here, the Theban King, Alcmenaes husband great Amphitrio made His Generall, who to his Lord doth bring His enimies head that did his land inuade. Thinke him returning home, but sends before By letters to acquaint his beauteous wife Of his successe, himselfe in sight of shore Must land this night: where many a doubtfull strife Amongst them growes, but Ioue himselfe discends, Cuts off my speech, and heere my Chorus ends. Thunder and lightning. Iupiter discends in a cloude. Iup. Earth before heauen, we once more haue preferd: Beauty that workes into the hearts of Gods: As it hath power to mad the thoughts of men, So euen in vs it hath attraction. The faire Alcmena like the Sea-mans Starre Shooting her glistering beauty vp to heauen, Hath puld from thence the olimpick Iupiter By vertue of thy raies, let Iuno skold, And with her clamours fill the eares of heauen, Let her bee like a Bachinall in rage, And through our christall pallace breath exclaimes, With her quicke feete the galaxia weare, And with inquisitiue voice search through the Spheares. Shee shall not find vs here, or should she see vs, Can shee distinguish vs being thus transhapt? Where's Ganimed? we sent him to suruey Amphitrioes Pallace, where we meane to lodge Enter Ganimed shapt like Socia. In happy time return'd: now Socia. Gani. Indeed that's my name, as sure As your's is Amphitrio. Iup. Three nights I haue put in one to take our fill Of daliance with this beauteous Theban dame. A powerfull charme is cast or'e Phœbus eies: Who sleepes this night within the euxine sea, And till the third day shall forget his charge To mount the golden chariot of the Sunne, The Antipodes to vs, shall haue a day Of three daies length. Now at this houre is fought By Iosua Duke vnto the Hebrew Nation, (Who are indeede the Antipodes to vs) His famous battle 'gainst the Cananites, And at his orison the Sunne stands still, That he may haue there slaughter, Ganimed Go knocke and get vs entrance. Exit Iupiter. Gani. Before I knocke, let mee a little determine with my selfe, If I be accessary to Iupiter in his amorous purpose, I am little better then a parcell guilt baud, but must excuse my selfe thus, Ganimed is now not Ganimed, And if this imputation be put vpon mee, let it light vpon Socia, whom I am now to personate; but I am too long in the Prologue of this merry play we are to act, I will knocke, and the Seruingmen shall enter. 1. Seruing. Who knocks so late? Gani. Hee that must in, open for Socia, Who brings you newes home of the Theban warres. 2. Ser. Socia returned. Enter 3. Seruingmen. 3. Ser. Vnhurt, vnslaine? Gani. Euen as you see, and how, and how? 1. Ser. Socia? let me haue an armefull of thee. Gani. Armefuls, and handfuls too, my boyes. 2. Ser. The news, the news, how doth my Lord Amphitrio? Gani. Nay, how doth my Lady Alcmena, some of you cary her word my Lord will be heere presently. 1. Ser. I'le be the messenger of these glad newes. 2. Ser. I'le haue a hand in't too. 3. Ser. I'le not be last. Exeunt Seruingmen. Gani. They are gone to informe their Lady, who will bee ready to intertaine a counterfeite Lord, Iupiter is preparing himselfe to meet Alcmena, Alcmena, she to encounter Iupiter, her beauty hath inchanted him, his metamorphosis must beguile her: al's put to proofe, I'le into furnish my Lord whilst my fellow seruants attend their Lady: they come. Enter at one dore Alcmena, Thessula, 4. Seruingmen; at the other Iupiter shapt like Amphitrio to Ganimed. Alcm. But are you sure you spake with Socia? And did hee tell you of Amphitrioes health? 1. Ser. Madam, I assure you, wee spake with Socia, and my L. Amphitrio will be here instantly. Alcm. Vsher me in a costly banquet straight To entertaine my Lord, let all the windowes Glister with lights like starres, cast sweete perfumes To breath to heauen their odoriferous aires, And tell the Gods my husband's safe return'd, If you be sure 'twas Socia. 2. Ser. Madam take my life, if it be not true. Alcm. Then praise be to the highest Iupiter, Whose powerfull arme gaue strength vnto my Lord To worke his safety through these dangerous warres, Hang with our richest workes our chambers round, And let the roome wherein we rest to night, Flow with no lesse delight, then Iuno's bed When in her armes she claspeth Iupiter, Iup. I'le fill thy bed with more delighfull sweetes, Then when with Mars the Ciprian Venus meetes. Alcm. See how you stir for odours, lights, choise cates, Spices, and wines, is not Amphitrio comming With honour from the warres? where's your attendance? Sweete waters, costly ointments, pretious bathes, Let me haue all, for tast, touch, smell, and fight, All his fiue senses wee will feast this night. Iup. 'Tis time to appeare, Alcmena: Alcm. My deere Lord. Gani. It workes, it workes, now for Iuno to set a Skold betweene them. A banquet brought in. Alcm. Oh may these armes that guarded Thebes and vs, Be euer thus my girdle, that in them I may liue euer safe, welcome Amphitrio A banquet, lights, attendance; good my Lord Tell mee your warres discourse. Iup. Sit faire Alcmena. Alcm. Proceede my dearest loue. Iup. I as great Generall to the Theban King, March't gainst the Teleboans: who make head And offer vs encounter: both our Armies Are cast in forme, well fronted, sleeeu'd and wing'd Wee throw our vowes to heauen, the Trumpets sound, The battels signall, now beginnes the incursions, The earth beneath our armed burdens groanes, Shootes from each side reuerberat gainst heauen, With Arrowes and with Darts the aire growes darke And now confusion ruffles, Heere the shoutes Of Victors sound, there groanes of death are heard, Slaughter on all sides; still our eminent hand Towers in the aire a victor, whilst the enemy Haue their despoyled helmets crown'd in dust. Wee stand, they fall, yet still King Ptelera Striues to make head, and with a fresh supply Takes vp the mid-field: him Amphitrio fronts With equall armes, wee the two Generals Fight hand to hand, but Ioue omnipotent Gaue me his life and head, which we to morrow Must giue to King Creon. Alcm. All my orisons Fought on your side, and with their powerfull weight, Added vnto the ponder of your sword, To make it heauy on the Burgonet Of slaughtered Ptelera. Iup. I for my reward, Had by the Subiects of that conquered King A golden cup presented, the choice boule In which the slaughtered Tyrant vs'd to quaffe. Socia. Gani. My Lord. Iup. The cup, see faire Alcmena. Gani. This cup Mercury stole out of Amphitrioes casket, but al's one as long as it is truely deliuered. Alcm. In this rich boule I'le onely quaffe your health, Or vse, when to the Gods I sacrifice. Is our chamber ready? Iup. Gladly I'de to bed, Where I will mix with kisses my discourse, And tell the whole proiect. Alcm. Mirth abound, Through all these golden roofes let musicke sound, To charme my Lord to soft and downy rest. Iup. Come light vs to our sheetes. Alcm. Amphitrioes head Shall heere be pillowed, light's then and to bed. Exeunt with Torches. Gani. Alas poore Amphitrio I pitty thee that art to be made cuckold against thy wiues will, she is honest in her worst dishonesty, and chast in the superlatiue degree of inchastity: but I am set heere to keepe the gate: now to my office. Enter Socia with a letter. Socia. Heere's a night of nights, I thinke the Moone stands stil and all the Stars are a sleepe, he that driues Charles wayne is taking a nap in his cart, for they are all at a stand, this night hath bene as long as two nights already, and I thinke 'tis now entring on the third; I am glad yet that out of this vtter darkenes I am come to see lights in my Ladies Pallace: there will be simple newes for her when I shall tell her my Lord is comming home. Gani. 'Tis Socia and Amphitrioes man, sent before to tell his Lady of her husband, I must preuent him. Socia. This night will neuer haue an end, he that hath hired a wench to lie with him all this night, hath time enough I thinke to take his peny worths, but I'le knocke. Gan. I charge thee not to knock here least thou be knocked. Socia. What not at my Maisters gate. Gani. I charge thee once more, tell mee whose thou art? whether thou goest, and wherefore thou commest? Socia. Hither I go, I serue my Maister, and come to speak with my Lady, what art thou the wiser? nay, if thou beest a good fellow let me passe by thee. Gani. Whom dost thou serue? Socia. I serue my Lord Amphitrio, and am sent in hast to my Lady Alcmena. Gani. Thy name? Socia. Socia. Gani. Base counterfeit take that, can you not be content to come sneaking to one's house in the night, to rob it, but you must likewise rob me of my name? Socia. Thy name, why, what's thy name? Gani. Socia. Socia. Socia, and whom dost thou serue? Gani. My Lord Amphitrio chiefe of the Theban Legions, and my Lady Alcmena, but what's that to thee? Socia. Ha, ha, That's a good iest, but do you heare, If you be Socia my Lord Amphitrioes man, and my Lady Alcmenaes, Where dost thou lie. Gani, Where do I lie? why in the Porters Lodge. Socia. You are deceiu'd, you lie in your throate, there's but one Socia belongs to this house, and that am I. Gani. Lie slaue, and wilt out-face mee from my name? I'le vse you like your selfe a counterfeit, Beats him. What art thou? speake? Socia. I cannot tell. Gani. Whom dost thou serue? Socia. The time. Gani. Thy name? Socia. Nothing. Gani. Thy businesse? Socia. To bee beaten. Gani. And what am I? Socia. What you will. Gani. Am not I Socia? Socia. If you be not, I would you were so, to be beaten in my place. Gani. I knew my L. had no seruant of that name but me. Socia. Shall I speake a few coole words, and bar buffeting. Gani. Speake freely. Socia. You will not strike. Gani. Say on. Socia. I am the party you wot off, I am Socia, you may strike if you will, but in beating me (if you be Socia) I assure you, you shall but beate your selfe. Gani. The fellowes mad. Socia. Mad, am I not newly landed? sent hither by my Maister? Is not this our house? Do I not speake? Am I not awake? Am I not newly beaten? Do I not feele it still? And shall I doubt I am not my selfe? come, come, I'le in and doe my message. Gani. Sirrah, I haue indured you with much impatience, Wilt thou make me beleeue I am not Socia? Was not our ships launcht out off the Persicke hauen? Did I not land this night? Haue we not won the Towne where K. Ptelera raign'd? Haue we not orethrowne the Teleboans? Did not my Lord Amphitrio kill the King hand to hand? And did hee not send mee this night with a letter to certify my Lady Alcmena of all these newes. Socia. I beginne to mistrust my selfe, all this is as true as if I had told it my selfe; but Il'e try him further: What did the Teleboans present my Lord with after the victory. Gani. With a golden cuppe in which the King himselfe vs'd to quaffe. Socia. Where did I put it. Gani. That I know not, but I put it into a casket, sign'd by my Lords Signet. Socia. And what's the Signet? Gant. The Sun rising from the East in his Chariot, But do you come to vndermine me you slaue? Socia. I must go seeke some other name, I am halfe hang'd already, for my good name is lost; once more resolue me, if thou canst tell me what I did alone I will resigne thee my name: if thou bee'st Socia, when the battles began to ioyne, as soone as they beganne to skirmish, what didst thou? Gani. As soone as they began to fight I began to runne. Socia. Whither? Gani. Into my Lords tent, and their hid mee vnder a bed. Socia. I am gone, I am gone, somebody for charity sake either lend mee or giue me a name, for this I haue lost by the way, and now I looke better on he, me; or I, hee; as he hath got my name, hee hath got my shape, countenance, stature, and euerything so right, that he can bee no other then I my owne selfe; but when I thinke that I am I, the same I euer was, know my Maister, his house, haue sence, feeling, and vnderstanding, know my message, my businesse, why should I not in to deliuer my letter to my Lady. Gani. That letter is deliuered by my hand. My Lady knowes all, and expects her Lord, And I her seruant Socia am set heere To keepe such idle raskals from the gate, Then leaue mee, and by faire meanes, or I'le send thee leglesse, or armelesse hence. Socia. Nay, thou hast rob'd me of enough already, I would bee loath to loose my name and limbes both in one night: where haue I miscaried? where bene chang'd? Did I not leaue my selfe behind in the ship when I came away, I'le euen backe to my Maister and see if hee know mee, if hee know me, if he call me Socia, and will beare me out in't, Il'e come backe and do my message, spight of him saies nay, Farewell selfe. Exit. Gani. This obstacle, the father of more troubles I haue put off, and kept him from disturbance In their adulterate pastimes, faire Alcmena Is great already by Amphitrio And neere her time, and if shee proue by Iupiter He by his power and God-hood will contract Both births in one, to make her throwes the lesse: And at one instant shee shall child two issues, Be got by Ioue and by Amphitrio. The house by this long charm'd by Hermes rod Are stirring and Ioue glutted with delights, Ready to take his leaue, through satiate With amourous dalliance: parting's not so sweet Betweene our louers, as when first they meet. Enter Iupiter, Alcmena, and the seruants. Iupit. My deerest loue fare-well, we Generals Cannot be absent from our charges long: I stole from th'Army to repose with thee, And must before the Sunne mount to his Chariot, Be there againe. Alcm. My Lord, you come at midnight, And you make haste too, to be gone ere morne, You rise before your bed be throughly warme. Iup. Fairest of our Theban Dames, accuse me not, I left the charge of Souldiers to report The fortune of our battailes first to thee: Which should the campe know, they would lay on me A grieuous imputation, that the beauty Of my faire wife, can with Amphitrio more Then can the charge of legions. As my comming Was secret and conceal'd, so my returne, Which shall be short and sudden. Alc. That I feare, Better I had to keepe you beeing here. Iup. Nay part we must sweet Lady, dry your teares. Alc. You'l make my minuts months, &amp; daies seeme yeares. Iup. Your businesse ere we part? Alc. Onely to pray You will make haste, not be too long away. Fare-well. Iup. Fare-well. Come Ganimed, 'tis done, And faire Alcmena sped with a yong sonne. Exit. Enter Amphitrio, Socia, two Captaines with attendants. Amph. Oh Gentlemen, was euer man thus crost? So strangely flowted by an abiect groome? That either dreames, or's mad: one that speakes nothing Sauing impossibilities, and meerely False and absurd. Thus thou art here, and there, With me, at home, and at one instant both, In vaine are these delirements, and to me Most deeply incredible. Socia. I am your owne, you may vse me as you please: One would thinke I had lost inough already, to loose my name, and shape, and now to loose your fauour too. Oh! 1. Capt. Fye Socia, you too much forget your selfe, And 'tis beyond all sufferance in your Lord, To vse no violent hand. Socia. You may say what you will, but a truth is a truth. 2. Capt. But this is neither true nor probable, That this one body can deuide it selfe, And be in two set places. Fie Socia, fie. Socia. I tell you as it is. Amph. Slaue of all slaues the basest: vrge me not, Persist in these absurdities, and I vow To cut thy tongue out, haue thee scourg'd and beaten, Il'e haue thee flay'd. Socia. You may so, you may as well take my skin as another take my name and phisnomy: all goes one way. Amph. Tell ore thy tale againe, make it more plaine. Pray gentlemen your eares. Socia. Then as I sayd before, so I say still: I am at home; do you heare? I am heare: do you see? I spake with my Lady at home; yet could not come in at the gate to see her: I deliuered her your letter, and yet haue it still in my hand. Is not this plaine? do you vnderstand me? I am neither mad nor drunke but what I speake is in sober sadnesse. 1. Cap. Fie Socia, fie, thou art much, too much too blame. 2.Capt. How dare you tempt your maisters patience thus? Amph. Thinke not to scape thus: yet once more resolue me And faithfully: Do'st thou thinke it possible Thou canst be here and there? Be sencible, And tell me Socia. Socia. 'Tis possible; nor blame I you to wonder: for it maruels me as much as any heere: Nor did I beleeue that Hee, my owne selfe, that is at home, till hee did conuince me with arguments, told me euery thing I did at the siege, remembred my arrand better then my selfe: Nor is water more like to water, nor milke to milke, then that He and I are to me and him: For when you sent me home about midnight— Amph. What then? Socia. I stood there to keepe the gate a great while before I came at it. Capt. The fellow's mad. Socia. I am as you see. Amph. He hath been strooke by some malevolent hand. Socia. Nay that's certaine: for I haue been soundly beaten. Amph. Who beat thee. Socia. I my owne selfe that am at home, how oft shall I tell you? Amph. Sirrah, wee'l owe you this. Now gentlemen You that haue beene co-partners in our warres, Shall now co-part our welcome: we will visite Our beauteous wife; with whom (our businesse ended) We haue leasure to conferre. Enter Alcmena with her seruants and Mayd. Alc. Haue you took down those hangings that were plac'd To entertaine my Lord? 1. Seru. Madame they are. Alc. And is our priuate bed-chamber dis-roab'd Of all her beauty? to looke ruinous, Till my Lords presence shall repair't againe. 2. Seru. 'Tis done as you directed. Alc. Euery chamber, Office and roome, shall in his absence looke, As if they mist their maister, and beare part With mee in my resembled widow-hood. 3. Seru. That needs not madame: See my Lord's return'd. Alc. And made such haste to leaue me: I misdoubt Some tricke in this: It is distrust or feare Of my prou'd vertue: value it at best, 'T can be no lesse then idle iealousie. Amph. See bright Alcmena, with my sudden greeting, Il'e rap her soule to heauen, and make her surfet With ioyes aboundance. Beauteous Lady see Amphitrio return'd a Conquerour, Glad to vnfold in his victorious armes Thy nine-moneth absent body, whose ripe birth Swels with such beauty in thy constant wombe. How cheeres my Lady? Alc. So, so, wee'l do to her your kinde commends, You may make bold to play vpon your friends. Amph. Ha, what language call you this, that seemes to me Past vnderstanding? I conceiue it not, I reioyce to see you wife. Alc. Yet shals haue more? You do but now, as you haue done before. Pray flowt me still, and do your selfe that right, To tell that ore you told me yester-night. Amph. What yesternight? Alcmena this your greeting Distastes me. I but now, now, with these gentlemen Landed at Thebes, and came to do my loue To thee, before my duty to my King. This strangenesse much amazeth me. Socia. We haue found one Socia, but we are like to loose an Amphitrio. Alc. Shall I be plaine my Lord? I take it ill, That you, whom I receiu'd late yester-night, Gaue you my freest welcome, feasted you, Lodg'd you, and but this morning, two houres since Tooke leaue of you with teares, that your returne So sudden, should be furnisht with such scorne. Amph. Gentlemen, I feare the madnesse of my man Is fled into her braine, be these my witnesse, I am but newly landed: witnesse these With whom I haue not parted. 1. Capt. In this we needs must take our Generals part, And witnesse of his side. Alc. And bring you witnesse to suggest your wrongs, Against you two I can oppose all these. Receiu'd I not Amphitrio yester-night? 1. Seru. I assure you my Lord remember your selfe, you were here yester-nighr. All. 'Tis most certaine. Amph. These villaines all are by my wife suborn'd, To seeke to mad me. Gentlemen pray list, Wee'l giue this errour scope: Pray at what time Gaue you me entertainement the last night? Alc. As though you know not? Well, Il'e fit your humor, And tell you what you better know then I. At mid-night. Amph. At mid-night: Pray obserue that Gentlemen, At mid-night we were in discourse a boord Of my Commission. 2. Capt. I remembr't well. Amph. What did we then at mid-night? Alc. Sate to banquet. 1. Seru. Where I waited. 2. Seru. So did we all. Amph. And I was there at banquet. 3. Seru. Your Lordship's merry: do you make a question of that? Alc. At banquet you discourst the Inter-view Betweene the Theleboans and your hoast. Amph. Belike then you can tell vs our successe, Ere we that are the first to bring these newes Can vtter it. Alc. Your Lordship's pleasant still. The battailes ioyn'd, cryes past on either side, Long was the skirmish doubtfull, till the Thebans Opprest the Theleboans: but the battaile Was by the King renewed: who face to face And hand to hand, met with Amphitrio: You fought, and arme to arme in single combat, Troad on his head a Victor. Amph. How came you by this? Alc. As though you told it not. Amph. Well then, after banquet? Alc. We kist, embrac'd, our chamber was made ready. Amph. And then? Alc. To bed we went. Amph. And there? Alc. You slept in these my armes. Amph. Strumpet, no more. Madnesse and impudence contend in thee, Which shall afflict me most. Alc. Your iealousie And this imposterous wrong, heapes on me iniuries More then my sex can beare: you had best deny The gift you gaue me too. Amph. Oh heauen! what gift? Alc. The golden Cup the Theleboans King Vs'd still to quaffe in. Amph. Indeed I had such purpose, But that I keepe safe lock't. Shew me the bowle. Alc. Thessala, the standing cup Amphitrio gaue me Last night at banquet, ther's the key. Thessal. I shall. 1. Capt. My Lord, ther's much amazement in the opening of these strange doubts, the more you seeke to vnfold them, the more they pusle vs. 2. Capt. How came she by the notice And true recitall of the battailes fortune? Amph. That hath this villaine told her, on my life. Soc. Not I, I disclaime it, vnlesse it were my tother selfe, I haue no hand in it. Enter Thessala with the cup. Thessal. Madame, the bowle. Alc. Restor't Amphitrio, I am not worthy to be trusted with it. Amph. The forme, the mettal, and the grauing too. 'Tis somwhat strange. Socia, the casket streight. Socia. Here sir. Amph. What, is my signet safe? Soc. Vntouch't. Amph. Then will I shew her streight that bowle The Theleboans gaue me. Wher's my key? Soc. Here sir. This is the strangest that ere I heard, I Socia haue begot another Socia, my Lord Amphitrio hath begot another Amphitrio. Now, if this golden bowle haue begot another golden bowle, we shall be all twin'd and doubled. Amph. Behold an empty casket. Alc. This notwithstanding you deny your gift, Our meeting, banquet, and our sportfull night. Your mornings parting. Amph. All these I deny As falce, and past all nature, yet this goblet Breeds in me wonder, with the true report Of our warres proiect: But I am my selfe New landed with these Captaines, and my men, Deny all banquets and affaires of bed, Which thou shalt deerely answere. Alc. Aske your seruants If I mis-say in ought. 1. Seru. My Lord, there is nothing said by my Lady, but we are eye-witnesses of, and will iustifie on our oathes. Amph. And will you tempt me still? Socia, run to the ship, bring me the maister, And he shall with these Captaines iustifie On my behalfe, whilst I reuenge my selfe On these falce seruants, that support their Lady In her adulterous practise. Villaines, dogges. 1. Capt. Patience my Lord. Amphitrio beats in his men. Exit. Alc. Nay let him still proceed, That hauing kild them, I may likewise bleed. His frensie is my death, life I despise, These are the fruits of idle iealousies. Yonder he comes againe, Enter Iupiter. So soone appeas'd, And from his fury: I shall nere forget This iniury, till I haue paid his debt. Iupiter. What sad Alcmena? Pre'thee pardon me, 'Twas but my humour, and I now am sorry. Nay whither turn'st thou? Alcm. All the wit I haue, I must expresse: borne to be made a slaue: I wonder you can hold your hands, not strike, If I a strumpet be, and wrong your bed, Why doth not your rude hand assault this head? Iup. Oh my sweet wife, of what I did in sport, Condemne me not: If needs, then chide me for't. Alc. Was it because I was last night to free Of courteous dalliance, that you iniure me? Was I too lauish of my loue? Next night Feare not, Il'e keepe you short of your delight: Il'e learne to keepe you off, and seeme more coy, You shall no more swim in excesse of ioy, Looke for't hereafter. Iup. Punish me I pray. Alc. Giue me my dower and Il'e be gone away: Leaue you to your harsh humors, and base strife, Onely the honour of a vertuous wife Il'e beare along; my other substance keepe: For in a widowed bed Il'e henceforth sleepe. Iup. By this right hand, which you Amphitrio owe, My wrongs henceforth shall nere afflict you so. Speake, are we friends? By this soft kisse I sweare, No Lady liuing is to me like deare. These nuptiall brawles oft-times more loue beget: The rauishing pleasures, when last night we met We will redouble. These hands shall not part Till we be reconcil'd. Alc. You haue my heart; nor can my anger last. Iup. Faire loue then smile. Enter Blepharo and Socia. And let our lips our hearts thus reconcile. Bleph. Thou tel'st me wonders. Socia. I assure you there are two Socia's, and for ought I can heare, there are two Amphitrio's: we were in hope to haue two golden bowles. Now if your ship can get two maisters, you wil be simply furnish't to sea. But see my Lord and my Lady are friends; let vs be partakers of their reconcilement. Bleph. Haile to the generall: you sent to me my Lord. Iup. True Blepharo: But things are well made euen, and we attoned, Your chiefest businesse is to feast with vs. Attend vs Socia. Faire Alcmena now We are both one, combin'd by oath and vow. Exeunt. Socia. Ther's musicke in this: If they feast Il'e feast with them, and make my belly amends for all the blowes receiu'd vpon my backe. Enter Ganimed. Gan. Iupiter and Alcmena are entred at the backe gate, whil'st Amphitrio is beating his seruants out at the foregate. Als in vp-rore: I do but watch to see him out in the street, to shut the gates against him. But yonder is Socia, I'le passe by him without speaking. Socia. I should haue seene your face when I haue look't my selfe in a glasse, your sweet phisnomy, should be of my acquaintance: I will not passe him without Conge. They passe with many strange Conges. Enter Amphitrio, beating before him his seruants, the two Captaines, they meet with Ganimed. Amph. Villaines, dogges, diuels. 1. Capt. Noble Generall. Amph. These wrongs are too indigne. Socia return'd? Where's Blepharo? Gan. I haue sought him a boord; but he is in the Citty to see some of his friends, and will not returne till dinner. Now for a tricke to shut the gates vpon him. Exit. Amph. Patience, if thou hast any power on earth, Infuse it here, or I these hypocrites, These base suggesters of their Ladies wrongs, Shall to the death pursue. 2. Capt. Finde for their punishment Some more deliberate season: sleepe vpon't, And by an order more direct and plaine Void of this strange confusion, censure them. Amphi. Sir, you aduise well, I will qualify This heate of rage: now I haue beate them forth Let's in and see my wife, Socia stolne hence And the gates shut, let's knocke. Knockes, enter Ganimed aboue. Gani. What Ruffin's that that knocks? you thinke belike the nailes of our dores are as sawcy as your selfe, that they neede beating. Amphi. Socia I am thy Lord Amphitrio. Gam. You are a fooles head of your owne, are you not? Amphi. Ruffin and foole. Gani. Take coxcombe and asse along, if you bee not satisfied. Amphi. Do you condemne me now, pray Gentlemen Do me but right, haue I iust cause to rage? Can you that haue perswaded mee to peace Brooke this? oh for some battering engine heere To race my Pallace walles, or some iron Ramme To plant against these gates, Gani. Sirrah, I'le make you eate these words, stay but till I come downe, I'le send you thence with a vengeance, I am now comming, looke to't, I'le tickle you with your counterfeit companions there. Exit. 1. Cap. This is too much, 'tis not to be indured. Amphi. I wish of heauen to haue no longer life then once more to behold him, hee shall pay for all the rest. 2. Cap. He promist to come downe. Enter Socia and Blepharo. 1. Cap. And I thinke hee will, for harke, I heare the gates open. Amphi. Forbeare a little, note the villaines humor. Socia. Al's quiet within, I'le go helpe to fetch my Lords stuffe from ship, but see, hee's out of the gates before vs, which way came hee? Bleph. Hee hath made hast. Socia. I thinke he hath crept through the key-hole. Amph. Nay, I'le be patient feare not, note my humor: Socia. Socia. My Lord. Amphi. My honest Blepharo I'le talke with you anone, my faithfull seruant, who past this house to you, that you haue power to keepe the Maister out? tell me, what know you by your faire Mistresse, that you call your Lord coxcombe and asse, (nay I am patient still) Amphitrioes name is heere forgot, foole, ruffin are nothing, them I pardon, now you are downe, when do you beate me head-long from the gate, and these my counterfeit companions hence. Socia. Who I, I, is your Lordship as wise as God might haue made you, I Amphi. You see we are here still, when doe you strike, what? not: Then I'le beginne with you. Bleph. Amphitrio. Socia. My Lord's mad, helpe Gentlemen. Bleph. If you be Gentlemen and loue Amphitrio, Or if you know me to be Blepharo Your Maister that transported you by sea Giue not this madnesse scope, vpon my credit Socia is guiltlesse of this falce surmise. Amphi. Is Blepharo turn'd mad too. Bleph. Generall no, It pitties me that left you late so milde And in such peacefull conference with your wise So suddenly to finde you lunaticke, Pray helpe to bind him Gentlemen. Amphi. So, so, am I abus'd or no, speake fellow souldiers. 1. Cap. Insufferable, and yet forbeare your rage, Breath, breath, vpon't and find some other leasure These errors to determine. Enter Iupiter, Alcmena, Ganimed before, all the seruants running fearefully. Amphi. Well, I will. Socia. Yonder's my brother, my same selfe. Bleph. Two Socia's, two Amphitrioes. 1. Cap. Coniuring, witch-craft. Iup. Friends and my fellow souldiers, you haue dealt Vnfriendly with mee, to besiedge my house With these exclaimes, to bring Imposters hither. Is there no law in Thebes? will Creon suffer me For all my seruice, to be iniur'd thus? Amph. Bee'st thou infernall hagge, or fiend incarnate, I coniure thee. Iup. Friends, I appeale to you: When haue you knowne me mad? when rage and raue? Shall my humanity and mildnesse thus Be recompenst? to be out-brau'd, out-fac'd By some deluding Fairy? To haue my seruants Beat from my gates? my Generall house disturb'd, My wife full growne, and groaning, ready now To inuoke Lucina, to be check't and scorn'd? Examine all my deeds, Amphitrioes mildnesse Had neuer reference to this Iuglers rage. 1. Capt. Sure this is the Generall, he was euer a milde Gentleman: Il'e follow him. 2. Capt. There can be but one Amphitrio, and this appeares to be he by his noble carriage. Bleph. This is that Amphitrio I conducted by sea: 1. Seru. My Lord was neuer mad-man. This shall be my maister. All. And mine. Alc. This is my husband. Soc. Il'e euen make bold to go with the best. Gan. Soft sir, the true Socia must goe with the true Amphltrio. Amph. Oh thou omnipotent thunder! strike Amphitrio, And free me from this labyrinth. Iup. Gentlemen, My house is free to you; onely debar'd These Counterfets: These gates that them exclude, Stand open to you: Enter, and taste our bounty, Attend vs. 'Lasse poore Amphitrio, I must confesse I do thee too much wrong, To keep thee in these maze of doubts so long; Which here shall end: For Iuno I espy, Who all our amorous pastimes sees from hye: As she descends, so must I mount the spheares To stop her, lest she thunder in our eares. Exeunt all but Amphitrio and Socia. Amph. What art thou? Soc. Nay, what art thou? Amph. I am not my selfe. Soc. You would not beleeue me when I sayd I was not my selfe: why should I beleeue you? Amph. Art thou Socia? Soc. That's more then I can resolue you: for the world is growne so dangerous, a man dares scarce make bold with his owne name; but I am he was sent with a letter to my Lady. Amph. And I am he that sent thee with that letter, Yet dare not say I am Amphitrio; My wife, house, friends, my seruants all deny me. Soc. You, haue reason to loue me the better, since none stickes to you but I. Amph. Let all yon starry structure from his basses Shrinke to the earth, that the whole face of heauen Falling vpon forlorne Amphitrio, May like a marble monumentall stone, Lye on me in my graue Eternall sleepe Cast a nocturnall filme before these eyes, That they may nere more gaze vpon yon heauens, That haue beheld my shame: or sleepe or death Command me shut these opticke windowes in: My braine is coffin'd in a bed of lead, 'Tis cold and heauy; be my pillow Socia: For I must sleepe. Soc. And so must I, pray make no noyse, for waking me or my maister. They sleepe. Iuno and Iris descend from the heauens. Iuno. Iris away, I haue found th'adulterer now: Since Mercury faire Ioe's keeper slew, The hundred-eyed Argus, I haue none To dogge and watch him when he leaues the heauens. No sooner did I misse him, but I sought Heauen, sea, and earth: I brib'd the sunne by day, And starres by night; but all their iealous eyes He with thicke mists hath blinded, and so scap't. Iris my Raine-bow threw her circle round, If he had beene on earth, to haue clasp't him in, And kept him in the circle of her armes Till she had cal'd for Iuno: But her search He soone deluded in his slye trans-shapes. And till I saw here two Amphitrioes, I had not once suspected him in Thebes. Roab'd all in wrath, and clad in scarlet fury, I come to be aueng'd vpon that strumpet That durst presume to adulterate Iunoes bed. Pull me from heauen (faire Iris) a blacke cloud, From which Il'e fashion me a beldams shape, And such a powerfull charme Il'e cast on her, As that her bastard-brats shall nere be borne; But make her wombe their Tombes. Iris away. Iris. I flye Madame. Exit Iris. Iuno. No, these are mortals, and not them I seeke. I feare me if he heare of me in Thebes, He (with his Minion) streight will mount the heauens. But let him seat him on the loftiest spire Heauen hath: or place me in the lowest of hell, Il'e reach him with my clamours. Socia. Hey-ho, now am I dream'd of a scold. Enter Iris with a habit. Iuno. But Iris is return'd: Rage, feast thy fill, Till I the mother sley, the bastards kill. Exit Iuno. Thunder and lightning. All the seruants run out of the house affrighted, the two Captains and Blepharo, Amphitrio and Socia amazedly awake: Iupiter appeares in his glory vnder a Raine-bow, to whom they all kneele. Iup. The Thunderer, Thunderers, and the Lord of feare, Bids thee not feare at all Amphitrio. Ioue, that against the Theleboans gaue thee The palme of Conquest, and hath crown'd thy browes With a victorious wreath, commands thy peace With faire Alcmena, she that neuer bosom'd Mortall, saue thee; The errours of thy seruants Forbeare to punish, as forgot by vs, And finde vs to thy prayers propicious. Thy wife full growne, inuokes Lucinaes ayd: Send in to cheare her in her painefull throwes. Hers, and thy Orisons wee'l beare to heauen; And they in all your greatest doubts and feares, Shall haue accesse to our immortall eares. Amph. Ioue is our patron, and his power our awe, His maiesty our wonder: will, our law. Iup. Our Act thus ends, we would haue all things euen, Smile you on earth whilst we reioyce in heauen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus 3. Enter Homer one way, Iuno another. Homer. Behold where Iuno comes, and with a spell Shuts vp the wombe by which Ioues sonne must passe: For whilst shee Crosse-leg'd sits (as old wiues tell, And with clutch't hands) there is no way alas For faire Alcmena's childing. All those wiues That heare her painfull throwes, are in dispaire: Yet in her wombe the Ioue-bred Issue striues: Three dayes are past, her paines still greater are. But note a womans wit, though Iuno smile. A Beldams braine the Goddesse shall beguile. Iuno. Ha, ha! Now Ioue with thy omnipotence, Make (if thou canst) way for thy bastards birth, Whose passage I thus binde, and in this knot Which till their deaths, shall neuer be dissolu'd, I haue power to strangle all the charmes of hell. Nor powers of heauen shall streight me, till the deaths Of yon adulteresse and her mechall brats. Laugh Gods and men, sea, earth, and ayre make ioy, That Iuno thus Alcmena can destroy. Enter the Midwife, Galantis with two or three other aged women. Galan. Haue you obseru'd her to sit crosse-leg'd euer since my Lady began her trauell? I suspect witch-craft, Il'e haue a tricke to rouze her. Mid. No doubt but did she open her knees and fingers, my Lady should haue safe deliuery. Gal. Trust to my wit, Il'e in &amp; find a meanes to startle her. Beld. Note how the Beldame smiles, and in her clutches Strangles my Ladies birth: some friend remoue her. Iuno. Ha, ha, he, their teares my griefes recure, Thus I reuenge me of their deeds impure. Enter Galantis merry. Gal. Now Ioue be prais'd, and Ladies dry your teares, And gentle Madame come reioyce with vs. Iuno. Why, what's the matter? Gal. I cannot hold my ioy: thankes faire Lucina Goddesse of child-birth, Ioue and all be prais'd, Alcmena is deliuered, brought to bed Of a fine chopping boy. Iuno riseth. Iuno. Is my spell faild? how could I curse and teare? Mid. The witch is rouz'd, in and see what newes. Gal. Stay stay, Il'e go see what c?fort's within: for when I came out I left my poore Lady in midst of all her torment. Iuno. What edge of steele, or Adamantine chaine, Hath forc'd in two the vertue of my charme? Which Gods and diuels gaue vnite consent To be infract? Oh powerfull Iupiter! I feare thy hand's in this. Enter Galantis extreamely laughing. Beld. How the witch stormes! Iuno. What meanes the wretch to hold her sides &amp; laugh, And still to point at me? How now Galantis? Gal. That's my name indeed: (hold heart, hold) you are a witch, are you? you sat crosse-leg'd, did you? my Lady could not bee brought to bed, could she? And now Gallantis hath gul'd you, hath she? Iuno. The morrall. Gal. Il'e tell thee; I suspecting thy trechery to my Lady, brought in counterfet newes she was brought to bed, which you (gooddy witch) no sooner heard, but rose vp; &amp; no sooner you had cast your armes abroad, but my Lady was deliuered of two goodly boyes, one like my Lord Amphitrio, but the other the brauest chopping lad—laugh the beldam out of her skin, &amp; then returne to comfort my Lady. Exeunt Iuno. Oh that we should be subiect to the Fates! And though being Gods, yet by their power be crost. Galantis, Il'e be first reueng'd on thee For this derision, and trans-forme thy shape To some fowle monster, that shall beare thy name. And are the bastards borne? They haue past the wombe, They shall not passe the cradle. Iris Ho. Enter Iris. Iris. Madame. Iuno. Fly into Affricke, from the mountaines there Chuse me two venemous serpents, of the blood That Perseus dropt out of the Gorgons head When on his winged horse, with that new spoyle He crost the Affricke climate: thou shalt know them By their fell poyson, and their fierce aspect. When Iris? Iris. I am gone. Iuno. Haste Iris, flye with expeditions wings, These brats shall dye by their inuenomed stings. Homer. The iealous Goddesse in the Chamber throwes The poysonous serpents, who soone wound and kill Yong Ipectetes, whom Amphitrio owes. But Hercules, whom Ioue with power doth fill, You first shall in his infant-cradle see, Ere growne a man, famous for chiualrie. The Nurses bring yong Hercules in his Cradle, and leaue him. Enter Iuno and Iris with two snakes, put them to the childe and depart: Hercules strangles them: to them Amphitrio, admiring the accident. Hom. He that could in his cradle serpents kill, Will (being growne) the world with wonders fill. Imagine him full growne, and nobly train'd By King Euristeus, the bold youth proclaimes Pastimes of exercise, where he hath gain'd Chiefe praise and palme in these Olimpicke games. Them we must next, as his first grace present With Iuno, to his fame maleuolent: Enter, after great shouts and flourishes, Iuno and King Euristeus. Iuno. Harke, harke Euristeus, how the yelling throats Of the rude rabble, deifie his praise: Their lofty clamours, and their shrill applauses Strike 'gainst the cleare and azure floores of heauen, And thence against the earth reuerberate, That Iuno can nor rest aboue nor here, But still his honours clangor strikes mine eare. Eurist. Patience celestiall Goddesse, as I wish Your powerfull aidance when I need it most, So for your sake I will impose him dangers, Such and so great, that without Ioues owne hand, He shall not haue the power to scatter them. Iuno. If neither tyrants, monsters, sauages, Giants nor hell-hounds, can the bastard quell; Let him be pasht, stab'd, strangled, poisoned, shouts within. Or murdered sleeping. Harke Euristeus still How their wide throates his high applauses shrill. Eur. Th'earth shall not breed a monster, nor the heauens Threaten a danger shall not taske his life. Iuno. Thou chim'st me spheare-like musicke, I haue rouz'd A monstrous Lyon, that doth range these woods: My deere Euristeus, make him tugge with him. shouts. Still doth his praise make the heauen resound; Farewell Euristeus, Il'e not see him crown'd. Exit Iuno. Enter the Kings of Greece to Euristeus with Garlands, Hercules, Theseus, Perithous, Philoctetes, with others from the games of Olimpus. 1. King. These honoured pastimes on Olimpus mount, Begun by thee the Theban Hercules, Shall last beyond all time and memory. Thou art vnpeer'd, all Greece resounds thy praise, And crowne thy worth with these greene wreaths of Baies. Herc. More deere to me then the best golden Arch That ere crown'd Monarkes brow, we haue begun In pastimes, wee'le proceed to acts more dreadfull, To expresse our power and hardiment: Though by your sufferage, we haue best deseru'd; Yet merit we not all, these Grecian Princes, Although degree'd below vs, did excell, Though not as best, receiue as those did well. Theseus, Perithous, Philoctetes, take Your valours meeds, your praises lowd did sound, Then each one take from Hercules a crowne. Thes. Braue Theban youth, no lesse then Ioues owne son, Giue Theseus leaue both to admire and loue thee: Lets henceforth haue one soule. Herc. Theseus commands the heart of Hercules, And all my deeds, next Ioue omnipotent, Il'e consecrate to thee and to thy loue. Perith. Though all vnworthy to be stil'd the friend Of great Alcides, giue Perithous leaue To do thee honour, and admire thy worth. Philoct. That Philoctetes begges of Hercules. Thy curtesie equals thy actiue power: And then in both art chiefe and patternelesse. Herc. We prize you as the deerest gemmes of Greece, And all the honours of Alcmenaes sonne You shall partake, whil'st these braue Argiue Kings, That rang vs plaudits for the Olimpike games, Shall clap our triumphes 'gainst the dreadful'st monsters Heauen can send downe, or deepe Auerno belch forth. As for the earth-bred monsters, we haue power Infus'd by Ioue, to calme their insolence. Nor will we cease, till we haue purchas'd vs The name of Tyrant-tamer through the world. Eurist. It glads Euristeus to be made so happy As to be Tutor to this noble youth. Thou hast (witnesse Olimpus) prou'd thy selfe The swiftest, actiu'st, ablest, strongest, conning'st In shaft or dart; which when thy step-dame Iuno Shall vnderstand how much thou do'st excell, As 'twill please Ioue, it will content her well. Herc. May we renowne Euristeus by our fame, As we shall striue to please that heauenly dame. Eur. Set on then Princes to the further honours Of this bold Theban: may he still proceed To crowne great Greece with many a noble deed. Enter a Heardsman wounded. Thes. Stay Lords: what meanes this Tragicke spectacle? Herds. If Greece, that whilome was esteem'd the spring Of valor, and the well of chiualry, Can yeeld an army of resolued spirits, Muster them all against one dreadfull beast, That keeps the forrests and the woods in awe: Commands the Cleonean continent, Vnpeoples townes; And if not interdicted, In time will make all Greece a wildernesse. Herc. Hearesman, thou hast exprest a monstrous beast, Worthy the taske of Ioue-borne Hercules. What is the sauadge? speake. Herds. Whether some God, With Greece offended, sends him as a murreine, To strike our heards; or as a worser plague, Your people to destroy: But a fierce Lyon Liues in the neighbour forrest, preying there On man and beast, not satisfied with both. Ten Heardsmen of my traine at once he slew, And me thus wounded; yet his maw vnstaunch't, He still the thicke Nemean groues doth stray, As if the world were not sufficient pray. Eurist. This Lyon were a taske worthy Ioues sonne, Oh free vs from this feare great Hercules. Herc. If he be den'd, Il'e rouze the monstrous beast; If seeking prey, Il'e chace him through the groues, And hauing ouer-run the fugitiue, Dare him to single warre: It fits Ioues sonne Wrastle with Lyons, and to tugge with Beares, Grapple with Dragons, and incounter Whales. Be he (as Ioues owne shield) invulnerable, Or be his breast hoop't in with ribbes of brasse, Be his teeth raser'd, and his tallons keepe, Sending at euery blow, fire from his bones, Yet I ere night will case me in his skin. This is a sport— Aboue th'Olimpiads; we will hunt to day Yon fierce Nemean terror, as a game Becomming Hercules. Winde hornes, away: For now a generall hunting we proclaime, Follow vs Princes, you that loue the game. Exeunt. Windhornes. Enter Iuno and Iris aboue in a cloud. Iuno. Yon cheerefull noyse of hunting tels mine eare Hee's in the Chace: Redouble Ire on Ire, And teare the bastard Theban limbe from limbe. Where art thou Iris? tell me from the cloud, Where I haue plac'd thee to behold the Chace. Iris aloft. Great Hercules Pursues him through the medowes, mountaines, rockes. Iuno. And flyes the sauadge? will he not turne head, Knowing his skin (saue by Ioues Thunderbolt) Not to be pierc'd? base trembling coward beast. Iris. Now doth the Lyon turne 'gainst Hercules With violent fury: 'lasse poore Hercules. Iuno. Gramercy Iris, I will crowne thy brow With a new case of starres, for these good newes. Shouts within. Iris. Oh! well done Hercules. He shakes him from his shoulders like a feather. And hurles the Lyon flat: The beast againe Leaps to his throat; Alcides grapples with him. The Lyon now: Now Hercules againe. And now the beast; me thinkes the combat's euen. Iuno. Not yet destroyd? Shouts within. Iris. Well, wrastled Hercules: He gaue the monstrous Lyon such a fall, As if a mountaine should ore-whelme withall. Aboue him still: he chokes him with his gripes, And with his ponderous buffets stownds the beast. Iuno. Thus is my sorrow, and his fame increast. Iris. Now he hath strangled him. Iuno. Iris discend. But though this faile, Il'e other dangers store, My Lyon slaine, I will prouide a Boare. Enter to them at one doore, Euristeus, and the Kings of Greece: at the other Hercules, with the Lyons head and skinne, Theseus, Perithous, Philoctetes. Herc. Thus Hercules begins his Iouiall taskes: The horrid beast I haue torne out of his skin, And the Nemean terror naked lyes, Despoyl'd of his inuinced coat of Armes. Iuno. This head (O wer't the head of Hercules) Doth grace Alcides shoulders, and me thinkes, Deck'd in these spoyles, thou dar'st the God of Armes. Herc. To you great Iuno, doth Alcmena's sonne His high laborious valour dedicate. You might haue heard the Lyon roare to heauen; Euen to the high tribunall in the Shpeares, Where you sit crown'd in starres. We fac'd the beast, And when he fixt his tallons in our flesh, We catch't the monster in our manly gripes, And made him thrice breake hold. Long did we tugge For eminence; but when we prou'd his skin To be wound-free, not to be pierc'd with steele, We tooke the sauadge monster by the throat, And with our sinowy puissance strangled him. Eurist. Alcides honours Thebes, and fames whole Greece. Herc. There shall not breath a monster here vnawed, We shall the world affoord a wonderment, Vnparalel'd by Theban Hercules. This Lyons case shall on our shoulders hang, Wee'l arme our body with th'vnvulner'd skin; And with this massy Club all monsters dare: And these shall like a bloudy meteor shew More dreadfull then Orions flaming lockes, T'affright the Gyants that oppresse the earth. Eur. Let Hercules meane time abide with vs, Till King Euristeus new atchieuements finde, Worthy his valour. Thes. Honour me great Prince, To grace my friend Perithous, and his ayd, To be at their high spowsals. Perith. Hypodamia Shall in this suit assist Perishous, With vs the Lapithes, the Centaurs meete, Those whom Ixion got vpon a cloud. They liue amongst the groues of Thessaly, And in their double shapes will grace our feast. Herc. Perithous, we will meet the Centaurs there, And quaffe with them to Hypodamia's health. But wherefore stands bright Iuno discontent? Iuno. Oh blame me not, an vncoth sauadge Boare Deuasts the fertill plaines of Thessaly: And when the people come to implore our ayd, Their liues no mortall that dare vndertake To combat him; The rough Nemean Lyon Was milde to this: he plowes the forrests vp, His snowy foame he scatters ore the hils, And in his course or-turnes the Dordan okes: Oh let him dye by mighty Hercules. Herc. Eternall Goddesse, were his sharpned teeth More dreadfull then the phangs of Cerberus, Or were his bristled-hide Ioues Thunder proofe, Were his head brasse, or his breast doubly plated With 'best Vulcanian armour Lemnos yeelds; Yet shall his braines rattle beneath my Club. The Eremanthian forrest where he den's, Shall quake with terrour when we beat the beast: And when we cast his backe against the earth, The ground shall groane and reele with as much terror As when the Gyant Typhon shakes the earth. Iuno. Oh may'st thou liue the Theban Conquerour. (Dye by the fury of that sauadge swine, And with thy carkasse glut his rauenous maw.) Herc. Perithous, I will bring thee to thy Bridals This huge wilde swine, to feast the Centaurs with. Diana's wrath shall be Alcides dish, Which hee'l present to Hypodamia. Theseus and Philoctetes, you consort Perithous, and assist the Lapythes In these high preparations: We will take The Eremanthian forrest in our way. Let's part, and sacred Goddesse wish vs well In our atchieuements. Iuno. To be damn'd in hell. Exeunt. Enter Ceres and Proserpine attired like the Moone, with a company of Swaines, and country Wenches: They sing. With faire Ceres Queene of graine Song. The reaped fields we rome, rome, rome, Each Countrey Peasant, Nimph and Swaine Sing their haruest home, home, home; Whilst the Queene of plenty hallowes Growing fields as well as fallowes. Eccho double all our Layes, Make the Champians sound, sound, sound To the Queene of harvest praise, That sowes and reapes our ground, ground, ground. Ceres Queene of plenty hallowes, Growing fields as well as fallowes. Ceres. As we are Ceres, Queene of all fertility, The earthes sister, Aunt to higest Iupiter, And mother to this beauteous childe the Moone, So will we blesse your haruests, crowne your fields With plenty and increase: your bearded cares Shall make their golden stalkes of wheat to bend Below their laden riches: with full sickles You shall receiue the vsury of their seeds. Your fallowes and your gleabes our selfe will till Frow euery furrow that your plow-shares raze Vpon the plenteous earth, our sisters breast, You shall cast vp aboundance for your gratitude To Ceres and the chaste Proserpina. Pros. Whil'st with these swaines my mother merry-makes, And from their hands eates cakes of newest wheate, The firstlings of their vowed sacrifice, Leaue me behinde to make me various garlands Of all the choycest flowers these medowes yeeld, To decke my browes, and keep my face from scorches Of Phœbus raies. Ceres. That done returne to vs, Vnto our Temple, where wee'l feast these swaines. Proserp. No sooner shall faire Flora crowne my temples, But I your offerings will participate. Ceres. Now that the heauens and earth are both appeas'd, And the huge Giants that assaulted Ioue, Are slaughtered by the hand of Iupiter; We haue leasure to attend our harmelesse swaines: Set on then to our Rurall ceremonies. Exeunt singing. Tempests hence, hence winds and hailes, Tares, cockle, rotten showers, showers, showers, Our song shall keep time with our flailes, When Ceres sings, none lowers, lowers, lowers. She it is whose God-hood hallowes Growing fields as well as fallowes. Proser. Oh! may these medowes euer barren be, That yeeld of flowers no more variety. Here neither is the white nor sanguine Rose, The Straw-berry flower, the Paunce nor Violet: Me thinkes I haue too poore a medow chose, Going to begge, I am with a begger met That wants as much as I: I should do ill To take from them that need. Here grow no more, Then serue thine owne despoyled breast to still, The meades I rob, shall yeeld me greater store. Thy flowers thou canst not spare, thy bosome lend, On which to rest whil'st Phœbus doth transcend. She lyes downe. Thunder. Enter Pluto, his Chariot drawne in by Diuels. Pluto. What hurly-burly hath beene late in heauen Against our brother loue omnipotent? The Gyants haue made warre: great Briareus, Whose hundred hands, a hundred swords at once Haue brandish't against heauen, is topsie turn'd, And tumbled headlong from th'Olimpicke Towers. But big-limb'd Typhon, that assaulted most, And hurl'd huge mountaines 'gainst heauens christall gates To shatter them, wrastled with Ioue himselfe: Whose heeles tript vp, kick't 'gainst the firmament; And falling on his backe, spread thousand acres Of the affrighted earth, astonish't Iupiter, Lest he should rise to make new vp-rores there, On his right hand the mount Pelorus hurle: Vpon his left spacious Pachinne lyes, And on his legges, the land of Liliby: His head the ponderous mountaine Ætna crownes, From which the Gyant breathes infernall fires: And struggling to be freed from all these weights, Makes (as he moues) huge earth-quakes that shake th'earth And make our kingdomes tremble. Frighted thence, We haue made ascent to take a free suruey Whether the worlds foundations be still firme; Lest being cranied, through these concaue cliffes, The Sunne and starres may shine, to lighten hell. Al's sound, we haue strooke th'earths basses with our mace, And found the Center firme: Our Iron Chariot That from his shod wheeles rusty darknesse flings, Hath with our weight, prou'd mountaines, dales and rocks, And found them no where hollow; All being well, Wee'l cleaue the earth, and sinke againe to hell. Proser. Ceres, oh helpe me father Iupiter, Yon vgly shape affrights me. Pluto. Ha, what's the matter? Who breath'd that well-turn'd shrike, sweet shape, bright beauty, Pluto's heart was neuer soft till now. Faire mortall. Proser. Hence foule fiend. Pluto. By Lethe, Styx, Cocytus, Acheron, And all the terrors our blacke Region yeelds, I see and loue, and at one instant both. Kisse me. Proser. Out on thee Hell-hound. Pluto. What are you, beauteous Goddesse? Proser. Nothing. Oh! Helpe mother, father, Ceres, Iupiter. Pluto. Be what thou canst, thou now art Pluto's rape, And shalt with me to Orcus. Proser. Clawes off Diuell. Pluto. Fetch from my sister Night a cloud of darknesse To roabe me in, in that Il'e hide this beauty From Gods and mortals, till I sinke to hell. Nay, you shall mount my Chariot. Pros. Ceres, Ioue. Pluto. Ceres nor Ioue, nor all the Gods aboue Shall rob me this rich purchase. Yoake my stallions That from their nostrils breath infernall fumes: And when they gallop through these vpper worlds, With fogges choake Phœbus, chace the starres from heauen, And while my Ebon Chariot ore the rocks, Clatters his Iron wheeles, make a noyse more hideous Then Panompheus thunder. Pros. Helpe heauen, helpe earth. Pluto. Cleaue earth, and when I stampe vpon thy breast Sinke me, my brasse-shod wagon, and my selfe, My Coach-steeds, and their traces altogether Ore head and eares in Styx. Proser. You Gods, you men. Pluto. Eternall darknesse claspe me where I dwell Sauing these eyes, wee'l haue no light in hell. Exit. Enter Ceres. Ceres. Where is my faire and louely Proserpine? The feast is done, and she not yet return'd: Speake Ioues faire daughter, whither art thou straid? I haue sought the medowes, gleabes, and new-reap't fields, Yet cannot finde my childe. Her scattered flowers, And garland halfe made vp, I haue light vpon, But her I cannot spy. Behold the trace Of some strange wagon, that hath scortch't the fields, And sing'd the grasse: these routes the sunne nere sear'd. Where art thou loue? where art thou Proserpine? Hath not thy father Ioue snatch't thee to heauen Vpon his Eagle? I will search the spheares But I will finde thee out: swift Mercury, Ioues sonne, and Mayas; speake, speake from the clouds, And tell me if my daughter be aboue. Mercury flies from aboue. Mer. Thy clamours (Ceres) haue ascent through heauen; Which when I heard, as swift as lightning I search't the regions of the vpper world, And euery place aboue the firmament. I haue past the planets, soar'd quite through the spheares; I haue crost the Articke and Antarkicke poles. Hot Cancer, and cold Arctos I haue search't, Past th'Hyperboreans, and the Solsticies, The Tropiques, Zones, Signes, Zeniths, Circles, Lines, Yet no where can I finde faire Proserpine. Exit Mercury. Ceres. If not in heauen, Il'e next inquire the earth, And to the place where old Oceanus Layes his hoare head in Amphitrites lap: Il'e trauell till I finde my girle. Assist me gracious Neptune in my search; And Tryton, thou that on thy shelly Trumpet, Summons the Sea-gods, answer from the depth, If thou hast seene or heard of Proserpine. Exeunt. Enter Tryton with his Trumpe, as from the sea. Tryt. On Neptunes Sea-horse with my concaue Trumpe, Through all th'Abysse, I haue shril'd thy daughters losse. The channels cloath'd in waters, the low citties, In which the water-Nymphes, and Sea-gods dwell, I haue perus'd; sought through whole woods and forrests Of leauelesse Corrall planted in the deepes, Tost vp the beds of Pearle, rouz'd vp huge Whales, And sterne Sea-monsters from their rocky dennes. Those bottomes, bottomlesse shallowes and shelues: And all those currents where th'earths springs breake in, Those plaines where Neptune feeds his Porposes, Sea-morses, Seales, and all his cattell else. Through all our ebbes and tides my Trump hath blaz'd her, Yet can no cauerne shew me Proserpine. Exit Tryton. Ceres. If heauen nor sea, then search thy bosome earth, Faire sister Earth, for these beauteous fields Spread ore thy breast; for all these fertill croppes, With which my plenty hath inrich't thy bosome, For all those rich and pleasant wreathes of graine With which so oft thy Temples I haue crown'd: For all the yearely liueries and fresh robes Vpon thy sommer beauty I bestow, Shew me my childe. Earth riseth from vnder the stage. Earth. Not in reuenge faire Ceres That your remorslesse plowes haue rak't my breast, Nor that your Iron-tooth'd harrowes print my face So full of wrinkles, that you digge my sides For marle and soyle, and make me bleed my springs Through all my open'd veines, to weaken me; Do I conceale your daughter: I haue spread My armes from sea to sea, look't ore my mountaines, Examin'd all my pastures, groues, and plaines, Marshes and wowlds, my woods and Champian fields, My dennes and caues; and yet from foot to head I haue no place on which the Moone doth tread. Earth sinkes. Ceres, Then Earth thou hast lost her: and for Proserpine Il'e strike thee with a lasting barrennesse. No more shall plenty crowne thy fertill browes, Il'e breake thy plowes, thy Oxen murren-strike: With Idle agues Il'e consume thy swaines, Sow tares and cockles in thy lands of wheat, Whose spykes the weed and cooch-grasse shall out-grow, And choke it in the blade. The rotten showers Shall drowne thy seed, which the hote sunne shall parch, Or mill-dewes rot; and what remaines shall be A prey to rauenous birds. Oh Proserpine! You Gods that dwell aboue, and you below, Both of the woods and gardens, riuers, brookes, Fountaines and wels, some one among you all Shew me her selfe or graue, to you I call. The riuer Arethusa riseth from the stage. Areth. That can the riuer Arethusa do, My streames you know faire Goddesse, issue forth From Tartary, by the Tenarian Isles: My head's in Hell, where Stygian Pluto reignes, There did I see the louely Proserpine, Whom Pluto hath rap't hence; behold her girdle, Which by the way dropt from her beauteous waste, And scattered in my streames. Faire Queene adue, Crowne you my banks with flowers, as I tell true. Exit Are. Ceres. Hath that infernall monster stolne my childe? Il'e mount the spheares, and there solicite Ioue, To inuade the Stygian kingdomes, to redeeme My rauish't daughter. If the Gods deny That grace to Ceres, Il'e inuoke the helpe Of some bold mortall: noble Hercules, Who with his Club shall rouze th'infernall King, Dragge out the furies with their snaky lockes, Strangle hels Iudges in their scarlet robes, And bring a double terrour to the damn'd. Of Gods and Men I will inuoke the aides To free my childe from those infernall shades. Enter Hercules, Theseus, Perithous, Philoctetes, Hypodamia, the Centaurs, Nessus, Euritus, Chiron, Cillarus, Antimachus, Hippasus. At a banquet. Herc. To grace thy feast faire Hypodamia, The Eremanthian forrest we haue rob'd Of that huge Boare: you Centaurs doubly shap't, Feed with Alcides on that monstrous swine, That hath deuour'd so many Swaynes and Heards. Thes. Take Theseus welcome for Perithous sake, And sit with vs faire Princes, take your place Next you Alcides; then the Centaurs round. Antimæc. Now by Ixion, that our grand-sire was, That dar'd to kisse the mighty thunderes wife, And did not feare to cuckold Iupiter, Thou dost the Centaur's honour. Ness. Let's quaffe the brides health in the bloud of grapes, Wine begets mirth, and mirth becomes a bridall. Perith. Fill then for Nessus and Antimachus, Let Euritus and Chiron pledge it round. Eur. Fill to vs all, euen till these empty bowles Turne vp their bottomes 'gainst the face of heauen. Chi. Off shall all this to Hipodamia's health, The beauteous bride: wil't pledge it Hercules? Herc. Yes, were it deeper then the golden cup Ioue quaffes in from the hand of Ganimed. Silanthus, Hippasus, and Cillarus, To the faire Princesse of the Lapythes. Anti. Shee's faire indeed, I loue her: wine and loue Adde fire to fire. To Philoctetes this. Phi. 'Tis welcome Hippasus. Here Cillarus. Cil. Faire Hypodamia's of the Centaurs brood, Great Bistus daughter, neere ally'd to vs, Il'e take her health. Perith. Gramercy Cillarus: Il'e do the like to faire Philonome, Thy sweet She-Centaur. Cil. Double this to her. Hyp. Crowne all your healths with mirth, let ioyes abound And to Philonome let this go round. Anti. Cramercies, 'lasse my braine begins to swim, I haue an appetite to kisse the bride, I and I will. Thess. What meanes Antimachus? Anti. Kisse Hypodamia, I and— Thes. That's too much, And more then any of the Centaurs dare. Cil. Why? who should hinder him? Thes. That Theseus will. Ant. Ha, ha, haue I from the fierce Lyon torne her whelp? Brought from the forrests she-Beares in my armes? And dandled them like infants? plaid with them, And shall I not then dare to kisse the bride? Herc. Audacious Centaur, do but touch her skirt, Prophane that garment Hymen hath put on; Or with thy hideous shape once neere her cheeke, Il'e lay so huge a ponder on thy skull, As if the basses of the heauen should shrinke, And whelme ore thee the marble firmament. Anti. That will I try. Cil. Assist Antimachus. A confused fray with stooles, cups &amp; bowles, the Centaurs are beaten. Peri. Rescue for Hypodamia. Chi. Downe with the Lapythes. Ness. Downe with Hercules. Herc. You cloud-bred race, Alcides here will stand To plague you all with his high Iouiall hand. Alarme. Enter Iuno, with all the Centaurs. Iuno. And shrinkes Ixions race? durst he aspire To our celestiall bed? though for his boldnesse He now be tortured with the wheele in hell? And dare not you withstand base Hercules? Currage braue Hyppo-Centaurs, let the bastard Be hew'd and mangled with our conquering arme. Renue the fight, make the Thessalian fields Thunder beneath your hoofes, whilst they imprint Vpon the earth, deepe semi-circled moones. Let all your arm'd race gallop from the hils, To inmure the faint deiected Lapithes. Tis Iuno, whom your tortur'd grand-sire lou'd, Bids you to Armes: lift vp your weapons hye And in their fall may great Alcides dye. Antimac. Our grand-sires wheeles cracke all that Centaurs bones, That flyes when Iuno giues incouragement. Chirus, Latreus, Nessus, Euritus, And all our race first tumbled in the clouds That crown'd the mountaine toppes of Thessaly, Make head againe, follow Antimachus, Whose braine through heated with the fumes of wine Burnes with the loue of Hypodamia. Theseus, Perithous, and Alcides, all Shall in this fury by the Centaurs fall. Alarme. Enter to them Hercules, Theseus, Perithous, and Philoctetes. Herc. Behold the lust-burn'd and wine-heated monsters Once more make head; wee'l pash them with our club. This Centaure-match, it shall in ages, And times to come, renowne great Hercules. Vpon them, when we parlee with our foes: Tongues peace: for we breake silence with our blowes. Alarme. They fight, the Centaurs are all disperst and slaine. Enter with victory, Hercules, Theseus, Perithous, Philoctetes, Hypodamia, and others. Herc. Let Thessaly resound Alcides praise, And all the two-shap't Centaurs that suruiue, Quake when they heare the name of Hercules. Were these Thessalian monsters bred at first By Saturne and Philiris, as some say, When in equinall shape she was deflour'd? Or when Ixion, snatcht to heauen by Ioue, And feasted in the hye Olimpicke hall, He sought to strumpet Iuno? The heauens Queene Transform'd a cloud to her celestiall shape, Of which he got the Centaurs. Be they bred Of earth or vapour, their hote fiery braines Are now dispurpled by Alcides Club, And in their deaths renowne the Lapythes. Thes. Ioues sonne was borne a terrour to the world, To awe the tyrants that oppresse and sway. Perith. But most indebt to thee Perithous is, That hast restor'd a virgin and a bride, Pure and vntouch't to sleep in these my armes. Hypoda. My tongue shall sound the praise of Hercules. My heart imbrace his loue. Herc. Oh had bright Iuno My louing step-dame, seated in the clouds, Beheld me pash the Centaurs with my club, It would haue fild her with celestiall ioyes; Knowing that all my deeds of fame and honour I consecrate to her and Iupiter. Of these proud Centaurs Nessus is escapt, The rest all strew the fields of Thessaly. Enter Ceres. Ceres. Reserues the noble Theban all his valour For th'ingrate Iuno, and hath stor'd no deed Of honour for deiected Ceres here? Ceres forlorne, forsaken and despis'd, Whom neither obdure heauen, relentlesse sea, Nor the rude earth will pitty. Herc. Queene of plenty, Lye it within the strength of mortall arme, The power of man, or worke of demi-god, I am thy Champion. Ceres. From heauen, earth and sea, Then Ceres must appeale to Hercules. Know then I am rob'd of beauteous Proserpine, Tartarian Dis hath rap't my daughter hence; Which when I heard, I skal'd the thundered throne, And made my plaints to him, who answered me, His power was onely circumscrib'd in heauen, And Pluto was as absolute in hell As he in heauen ; nor would he muster Gods Against the fiends, ore which his brother reign'd. Next made I suit to haue Neptune call his waters, And with his billowes drowne the lower world: Who answered, the firme channell bounds his waues, Nor is there passage betweene sea and hell, The earth beneath her center cannot sinke, Nor haue I hope from thence; onely great Hercules Herc. Will vndertake what neither Iupiter, Neptune, nor all the Gods dare make their taske: The Stygian Pluto shall restore the moone, Or feele the masse of this my ponderous club. Comfort faire Queene, Il'e passe the poole of Styx, And if leane Charon wastage shall deny, The Ferry-man Il'e buffet in his barge. Three-throated Cerberus that keepes hell-gates, Shall (when we come to knocke) not dare to howle: The ghosts already dead, and doom'd, shall feare To dye againe at sight of Hercules. Sterne Mynos, Æachus, and Rhadamant, Shall from the dreadfull sessions kept in hell, Be rouz'd by vs: wee'l quake them at that barre Where all soules stand for sentence: the three sisters Shall crowch to vs. Ceres, wee'l ransacke hell, And Pluto from th'infernall vaults expell. Thes. Theseus in this will ayd great Hercules. Peri. And so Perithous shall. Herc. Comfort Queene Ceres, Whom neither Harpyes, Boares or Buls can tame, The darke Cimerians must next sound his fame. Adue bright Hypodamia lately freed From the adulterous Centaurs: Our renowne That yet 'tweene heauen and earth doth onely shine, Hell shall next blaze for beauteous Proserpine. Homer. Ere Hercules the Stygianpooles inuade A taske which none but he durst vndertake, Without both earthy and immortall ayde, We Ioue present; who once more doth forsake Heauen, for a mortall beauty; one more rare Earth yeelded not then Semele the faire. Whilst Iuno, Hercules with hate pursues, Neglecting Ioue, he from the spheares espyes This bright Cadmeian, and the groues doth chuse To court her in: How, and in what disguise You next shall see, they meet first in the Chace, Where they discourse, acquaint, kisse, and imbrace. Dumbe Shew. Enter Somele like a huntresse, with her traine, Iupiter like a wood-man in greene: he woes her, and winnes her. What cannot Ioue, infus'd with power diuine? He woes and winnes, enioyes the beauteous dame; The iealous Iuno spyes their loue in fine, Leaues off her enuy to Alcides fame, And 'gainst this beauteous Lady armes her spleene, Quite to destroy the bright Cadmeian Queene. Your fauours still: some here no doubt will wonder, To see the Thunderers loue perish by thunder. Enter Iuno and Iris. Iuno. Hast thou found him Iris? Iris. Madame I haue. Iuno. Where? Iris. In the house of Cadmus, courting there The fairest of the race, yong Semele. Iuno. What am I better to be Queene of heauen, To be the sister and the wife of Ioue, When euery strumpet braues my Deity? Whilst I am busied to lay traps and traines For proud Alcmena's bastard, he takes time For his adulterous rapes. Europa liues Sainted in earth, Calisto shines a starre, Iust in mine eye, by name of Lesser Beare, Io in Ægypt is ador'd a Goddesse: And of my seruant Argus (slaine by Mercury) There liues no note; saue that his hundred eyes I haue transported to my peacockes traine. Thus fall the friends of Iuno, whilst his strumpets Front me on earth, or braue mine eye in heauen: But Semele shall pay for't. In what shape Saw'st thou him court that strumpet? Iris. Like a wood-man. Iuno. I met him on the mountaine Erecine, And tooke him for the yong Hyppolitus. Iris I hau't; 'tis plotted in my braine, To haue the strumpet by her louer slaine. Of her nurse Beroe Il'e assume the shape, And by that meanes auenge me on this rape. Exeunt: Enter Semele with her seruants and attendants. Semel. Oh Iupiter! thy loue makes me immortall, The high Cadmeian is my grace, To that great God exalted, and my issue, When it takes life, shall be the seed of Gods; And I shall now be ranck't in equipage With Danae, Io, Lada, and the rest, That in his amours pleas'd the thunderer best. Me-thinkes since his imbraces fil'd my wombe, There is no earth in me, I am all diuine: Ther's in me nothing mortall, saue this shape, Whose beauty hath cal'd Ioue himselfe from heauen, The rest all pure, corruptlesse and refin'd, That hath daz'd men, and made th'immortall blinde. Leaue vs, oh you vnworthy to attend Or wait vpon Cadmeian Semele: Hebe shall be my hand-mayd, and my wine The hand of Ioues owne cup-bearer shall fill, Il'e begge of him the Troian Ganimed To be my page; and when I please to ride, Borrow his Eagle through the ayre to glide. Go call me hither my Nurse Beroe, Whom I will make free-partner in my ioyes. Enter Iuno in the shape of old Beroe. Seru. Beroe attends your grace. Sem. Oh my deere nurse! liues there on earth a Princesse Equally lou'd and grac'd by Ioue himselfe? Iuno. Out on thee strumpet, I could teare those eyes, Whose beauty drew my husband from the skyes. Sem. Am I not happy Beroe? Iuno. Were you sure 'Twere Ioue himselfe this gladnesse did procure. Madame, there many fowle imposters be, That blinde the world with their inchastity: And in the name of Gods, being scarce good men, Iuggle with Ladyes, and corrupt their honors. Thinke you you stripling that goes clad in greene, Is Iupiter? Sem. I know him for heauens King, Whose issue in my wombe I feele to spring. Iuno. I thinke it not; but Lady this I know, That Gods are so lasciuious growne of late, That men contend their lusts to imitate. Sem. Not Iupiter. Iuno. Things truly reconcile, You'l iumpe with me: how haue you beene the while, Since you were breeding, now well, sometimes ill, Subject to euery imperfection still, Apt to all chances other women be. When were you lou'd of the high Deity, That hath the guift of strength, power, health, and ioy, The least of these could not your state annoy. Sem. Thou putst me in mistrust, and halfe perswad'st me He is no more then mortall whom I loue. How shall I proue him nurse? Iuno. Il'e tell you madame; When you see him next, Seeme with some strange and vncoth passion vext, And beg of him a boone, which till he grant, Sweare he no more your fauours shall inchant. Sem. Beroe, what boone? Iuno. To hugge you in that state In which faire Iuno he imbrac'd so late. To descend armed with celestiall fire, And in that maiesty glut his desire. His right hand arm'd with lightning, on his head Heauens massy crowne; and so to mount your bed. So are you sure he is a God indeed, Obtaine this boone, and fairely may you speed. Sem. Thou hast fir'd me Beroe. Iuno. Thou shalt be on flame, So great, the Ocean shall not quench the same. Sem. Beroe away, my chamber ready make, Tosse downe on downe: for we this night must tumble Within the armes of mighty Iupiter. Of whom Il'e begge th'immortall sweets of loue, Such as from Ioue Imperiall Iuno tastes. Begone without reply, my loue's at hand. Iuno. Thy death's vpon thy boone: this Iuno cheares, That my reuenge shall mount aboue the spheares. exit Iuno. Sem. I will not smile on him, lend him a looke, As the least grace, till he giue free ascent To fill me with celestiall wonderment. Enter Iupiter like a wood-man. Iup. Oh thou that mak'st earth heauen, &amp; turn'st th'imortal Into this shape terrestriall, thou bright issue Of old Ægenor, and the Cadmeian line, For whom, these stony buildings we preferre Before our Christall structures: that mak'st Ioue Abandon on the high counsels of the Gods To treat with thee of loues faire blandishments: Diuinest of thy race, faire Semele Fold in thy armes Olimpicke Iupiter. Sem. Iupiter! Iup. That Iupiter that with a powerfull nod Shakes the heauens arches, ore the vniuerse Spreads dread &amp; awe; and when we arme our selfe With maiesty, make th'earths foundation tremble, And all mortality flye like a smoake Before our presence vanish't and consum'd. Sem. Did Semele behold such Maiesty, She could beleeue this were the thunderers voyce, Thou hee? Iup. What meanes this strangenesse Semele? Haue I preferd thy beauty before hers Whose state fils heauen, whose food's Ambrosia, Vpon whose cup the louely Hebe waits When she quaffes Nectar? whose bright Chariot Is drawn with painted peacocks through the clouds And am I thus receiu'd? Sem. Thou bed with Iuno? Base groome, thou art no better then thou seem'st, And thy impostures haue deceiued a Princesse Greater then ere descended from thy line. Hence from my sight thou earth, that hast profan'd The dreadfull thunderers name: what see I in thee More then a man, to proue thy selfe a God? Thou deifi'd? thy presence groome is poore, Thy 'hauiour sleight, thy courtship triuiall, Thou hast not a good face, what's in thee worth The fauour and the grace of Semele? A God? alasse! thou art scarce a proper man. Iup. Ha, fails my shape, is he that awes the Gods, Now valued lesse then man? why Semele Proue me and what I can: wouldst thou haue gold? Il'e raine a richer shower in thy bosome Then ere I powr'd on Danae. Sem. Gold! what's that? Which euery mortall Prince can giue his loue. Iup. Wouldst thou increase thy beauty or thy strength? Sem. I am nor fowle nor sicke. Iup. Wouldst thou haue God-hood? I will translate this beauty to the spheares, Where thou shalt shine the brightest starre in heauen: Il'e lift thy body from this terrene drosse, And on two eagles, swift as Pegasus, Wee'l take our daily progresse through the clouds. Il'e shew thee all the planets in their ranke, The monstrous signes, the Lyon, Ramme and Bull, The blake-scald Scorpion, and the Cancers clawes. Aske what thou wilt to proue my Deity, And take it as thine owne faire Semele. Sem. Grant me one boone, lesse then the least of these, My armes shall spread thus wide to imbrace my loue, In my warme bosome I will gloue thy hand, And seale a thousand kisses on thy lippes. My fingers Il'e intangle in these curles, And scarse my Iuory arme about thy necke; And lay my selfe as prostate to thy loue, As th'earth her grasse-greene apron spreads for raine. Speake, shall I aske? or haue you power to grant? Iup. By dreadfull Styx, an oath I cannot change, But aske and haue. Sem. Then bed with me to night, Arm'd with the selfe-same God-hood, state and power You Iuno meet. Iup. Blacke day, accursed houre, Thou hast ask't too much, thy weake mortality Cannot indure the scorthing fires of heauen. Sem. Either you cannot doo't, as wanting might, Or loath you are to breed me such delight. Is this your loue? Iup. Thy death is in thy boone: But 'tis thy fate, she can it not recall, Nor I vnsweare: the infant in her wombe Not yet full growne and ripe, torments me most: For in this rash demand they both are lost. Sem. Il'e stand it at all dangers, and prepare For this nights sport. Iup. Aboue my thunders are, Thither I must, and beeing arm'd, descend To giue this beauty (in her rashnesse) end. Sem. Remember by this kisse you keep your oath. Iup. Neuer did Ioue to heauen ascend so loath; Expect me this sad night. Sem. With double ioy. Celestiall sweets shall surfet me, and cloy My appetite; the Gods are loath to impart Their pleasures to vs mortals. Dance my hart, And swim in free delights, my pleasures crowne, This Iouiall night shall Semele renowne. Exit Semele. Iuno and Iris plac'd in a cloud aboue. Iuno. Come Iris, ore the loftiest pinnacles Of this high pallace, let vs mount our selues, To see this noble pastime: Is't not braue? Iris. Hath her suit tooke effect? 'lasse Semele! Iuno. Hang, burne her witch, be all such strumpets fir'd With no lesse heat then wanton Semele. Oh 'twill be gallant sport, wil't not Iris? To see these golden roofes daunce in the aire. These pinnacles shall pricke the floores of heauen, These spires confused, tumble in the clouds; And all flye vp and shatter at the approach Of his great God-hood. Oh 'twould please me Iris To see this wanton with her bastard, blowne And hang'd vpon the high hornes of the moone. The howre drawes on, we may from hence espy Th'adultresse sprall, the pallace vpwards fly. Enter two maids of Semeles chamber. 1. Maid. Questionlesse my Lady lookes for some great Guests, that she makes all this preparation. 2. Maid. 'Tis not like she expects them at supper, because she herselfe is preparing to bed. 1. Maid Did you note how she made vs tumble &amp; tosse the bed before the making of it would please her? 2. Maid. There hath beene tumbling and tossing on that bed hath pleas'd her better; you know the youth in greene, he hath made my Lady looke red ere now. 1. Maid. You know shee is naturally pale; hee did but wrastle with her to get her a colour. 2. Maid. They youth in greene hath giuen her a medicine for the greene sicknesse, I warrant her: I am deceiued, if (when they meet) it go not two to one of her side. 1. Maid. Why do you thinke her with childe. 2. Maid. Tis past thinking, I dare sweare. But let's attend my lady. Enter Semele drawne out in her bed. Sem. Away, we will haue none partake our pleasures, Or be eye-witnesse of these prodigall sweets Which we this night shall in aboundance taste. This is the houre shall deifie my earth, And make this drosse immortall: thankes my Beroe, That thou hast made me begge my happinesse, Shew'd me the way to immortallity, And taught me how to emulate the Gods. Descen'd great Ioue in thy full maiesty, And crowne my pleasures: here behold me spred, To taste the sweets of thy immortall bed. Thunder, lightnings, Iupiter descends in his maiesty, his Thunderbolt burning. Iup. Thus wrapt in stormes, and black tempestuous clouds, Lightning and showers, we sit vpon the roofes And trembling Tarrasses of this high house That is not able to containe our power. Yet come we not with these sharpe thunders arm'd, With which the sturdy giants we ore-threw, When we the mighty Typhon sunke beneath Foure populous kingdomes: these are not so fiery, The Cyclopes that vs'd to forge our bolts, Haue qualifi'd their feruour, yet their violence Is 'boue the strength of mortals. Beauteous Semele, In steed of thee I shall imbrace thy smoakes, And claspe a fumy vapour left in place Thunder and lightning. Of thy bright beauty, Stormy tempests cease, The more I frowne, the more their breathes increase. Sem. What terror's this? oh thou immortall speake! My eyes are for thy maiesty too weake. As he toucheth the bed it fires, and all flyes vp, Iupiter from thence takes an abortiue infant. Iup. Receiue thy boone, now take thy free desire In thunder, tempest, smoake, and heauenly fire. Iuno. Ha, ha, ha. Faire Semele's consum'd, 'twas acted well: Come, next wee'l follow Hercules to hell. Iupiter taking vp the Infant, speakes as he ascends in his cloud. Iup. For Semele (thus slaine) the heauens shall mourne In pitchy clouds, the earth in barrennesse; The Ocean (for her slaughter) shall weepe brine, And hell resound her losse. Faire Semele Nothing but ashes now; yet this remainder, That cannot dye, being borne of heauenly seed, I will conserue till his full time of birth: His name Il'e Bachus call, and being growne, Stile him, The God of Grapes; his Bachenals Shall be renown'd at feasts, when their light braines Swim in the fumes of wine. This all that's left Of Semele, vnto the heauens Il'e beare, Whose death this Motto to all mortals lends: He by the Gods dyes, that 'boue man contends. Homer. Let none the secrets of the Gods inquire, Lest they (like her) be strooke with heauenly fire. But we againe to Hercules returne, Now on his iourney to the vaults below, Where discontented Proserpine doth mourne, There's made to cheere her an infernall show. Hels Iudges, Fates and Furies summond beene To giue free welcome to the Stygian Queene. A dumbe shew of Pluto and all his Diuels, presenting seuerall gifts and shewes to cheere, but she continues in her discontent. All this and more (the beauteous Queene to cheare) Pluto deuis'd, but still her griefe remaines: No food she tastes within the gloomy spheare, Saue of a ripe Pomegranat some few graines. The next thing we present (sit faire and well) You shall behold a Holy-day in hell. Enter Theseus, Perithous, and Philoctetes armed. Thes. Saw you not Hercules? Perith. Noble Theseus no. I left him in the forrest, chacing there Dianaes Hart, and striuing to out-run The swift-foot beast. Thes. His actiue nimblenesse Out-flies the winged bird, out-strips the steed, Catcheth the hare, &amp; the swift grey-hound tires Out-paceth the wilde Leopard, and exceeds Beasts of most actiue chace. Phi. We haue arriu'd At Tenaros; this is the mouth of hell, Which by my counsell, wee'l not seeke to enter Till Hercules approach. Thes. Not enter Philoctetes? Our spirits may compare with Hercules. Though he exceed our strength, I with my sword Will beat against blacke Tartaras Ebon gates, And dare the triple-headed dogge to armes, Hels tri-shap't porter. Phi. Not by my perswasion. Peri. Perithous will assist his noble friend, And in this worke preuent great Hercules. Let's rouze the hell-hound, call him from his lodge, And (maugre Cerberus) enter hels-mouth, And thence redeeme the rauish't Proserpine. Thes. Had Orpheus power by musicke of his harpe, To charme the curre, pierce Orcus, Pluto please, And at his hands begge faire Euridice: And shall not we as much dare with our swords, As he with fingring of his golden strings. Come, let our ioynt assistance rouze the fiend, Thunder against the rusty gates of hell, And make the Stygian kingdomes quake with feare. They beate against the gates. Enter Cerberus. Cerb. What mortall wretch, that feares to dye aboue Hath trauel'd thus farre to enquire out death? Thes. We that haue blaz'd the world with deeds of praise Must fill the Stygian Empire with our fame; Then rouze thee thou three-throted curre, and taste The strength of Theseus. Cerb. These my three empty throats you three shall gorge, And when my nailes haue torne you limbe from limbe, Il'e sit and feast my hunger with your flesh. These phangs shall gnaw vpon your cruded bones, And with your bloods Il'e smeare my triple chaps, Your number fits my heads, and your three bodies Shall all my three-throars set a worke at once. Il' worry you; and hauing made you bleed, First sucke your iuice, then on your entrails feed. Perithous fights with Cerberus, and is slaine. Thes. Hold bloudy frend, and spare my noble friend, The honour of the worthy Lapythes Lyes breathlesse here before the gates of hell: Cease monster, cease to prey vpon his body, And feed on Theseus here. Theseus is wounded. Cerb. Il'e eate you all. Enter Hercules. Herc. Stay and forbeare your vp-roare, till our club Stickle amongst you: whil'st we in the chace Haue catch't the swift and golden headed stagge; These valiant Greekes haue sunke themselues beneath The vpper world, as low as Erebus. Whom see we? Theseus wounded, yong Perithous Torne by the rauenous phangs of Cerberus. My griefe conuert to rage, and sterne reuenge. Come, guard thee well infernall Caniball, At euery stroke that lights vpon thy skull, Il'e make thee thinke the weight of all the world And the earths huge masse shall crowne thee. Cerb. Welcome mortall, Thou com'st to mend my breake-fast, thou wilt yeeld me many a fat bit. Herc. Il'e make thee eate my club, And swallow this fell mastiffe downe thy panch. At euery weighty cuffe Il'e make thee howle, And set all hell in vp-roare: when thou roarest, Thy barking groanes shall make the brasen Towers Where ghosts are tortur'd, eccho with thy sound. Plutoes blacke guard at euery deadly yell, Shall frighted run through all the nookes of hell. Hercules beats Cerberus, and binds him in chaines. Herc. Keep thou this rauenous hell-hound gyu'd &amp; bound, Hels bowels I must pierce, and rouze blacke Dis, Breake (with my fists) these Adamantine gates, The Iron percullis teare, and with my club Worke my free passage (maugre all the fiends) Through these infernals. Lo, I sinke my selfe In Charons barge, Il'e ferry burning Styx, Ransacke the pallace where grim Pluto reignes, Mount his tribunall, made of sable Iet, Despight his blacke guard, stownd him in his chaire, And from his arme snatch beauteous Proserpine. Ghosts, Furies, Fiends shall all before vs flye, Or once more perish, and so doubly dye. Hercules sinkes himselfe: Flashes of fire; the Diuels appeare at euery corner of the stage with seuerall fire-workes. The Iudges of hell, eand the three sisters run ouer the stage, Hercules after them: fire-workes all ouer the house. Enter Hercules. Herc. Hence rauenous vulture, thou no more shalt tire On poore Prometheus, Dunae spare your rubs, Stand still thou rowling stone of Sisiphus, Feed Tantalus with apples, glut thy panch, And with the shrinking waues quench thy hote thirst. Thy bones Ixion, shall no more be broke Vpon the torturing wheele: the Eagles beake Shall Titius spare at sight of Hercules, And all the horrid tortures of the damn'd Shall at the wauing of our club dissolue. Enter Pluto with a club of fire, a burning crowne, Proserpine, the Iudges, the Fates, and a guard of Diuels, all with burning weapons. Pluto. Wer't thou Imperiall Ioue, that swaies the heauens, And in the starry structure dwel'st aboue, Thou canst not reuell here: my flaming Crowne Shall scortch thy damn'd soule with infernall fires. My vassaile Furies with their wiery strings. Shall lash thee hence, and with my Ebon club Il'e ding thee to the lowest Barathrum. Herc. First shall this engine arm'd with spikes of steele, That fore the gates of hell strooke flat thy cutte. Fall with no lesse power on thy burning sconce, Then should great Ioue the massy center hurle, And turne the worlds huge frame vpon thy head. Pluto. Vpon him Diuels. Herc. Ayd me powers Diuine, From these blacke fiends to rescue Proserpine. Hercules fels Pluto, beats off the Diuils with all their fire-workes, rescues Proserpine. Now are we King of Orcus, Achercu, Cocytus, Styx, and fiery Phlegeton. Pros. Long liue Alcides, crown'd with Godlike honours, For rescuing me out of the armes of Dis, The vnder-world, and fiery iawes of hell. All the ghosts. Long liue eterniz'd noble Hercules, That hath dissolu'd our torments. Rha. Hercules, attend th'vnchanging doome of Rhadamunt, And if the Gods be subiect to the Fares, Needs must thou (noble Greeke) obey their doome, Lo, in their name, and in the awfull voyce Of vs the reuerend Iudges, to whose doome Thou once must stand: I charge thee stir not hence, Till we haue censur'd thee and Proserpine. Is not the power of Ioue confin'd aboue? And are not we as absolute in state Here in the vaults below? To alter this The heauens must faile, the sunne melt in his heat, The elements dissolue, Chaos againe Confuse the triple Masse, all turne to nothing: Now there is order: Gods there are, and Diuels: These reward vertue; the other punish vice. Alter this course you mingle bad with good, Murder with pitty, hate with clemency. Ther's for the best no merit, for the offender No iust infliction. Herc. Rhadamant speakes well. Pluto. To whom will Hercules commit this businesse? Herc. I will appeal to Ioue, and to the Planets, Whose powers, though bownded, yet infuse their might In euery mortall. Æacus. Them the Fates shall summon, Of whom this beauteous mayd, the Moone, is one, The lowest of the seuen: you reuerend sisters, Who all things that are past be, and to come, Keepe registred in brasse, assemble there. Herc. Be Ceres pleas'd, Alcides is content: Nor can she stand to bearer Iustices. Then to the Gods and Planets. Sownd. Enter Saturne, Iupiter, Iuno, Mars, Phœbus, Venus, and Mercury: they take their place as they are in bright. Ceres. Satur. I know this place, why haue you summon'd Saturne To hell, where he hath beene to arraigne the Moone? These vncoth cauernes better suit my sadnesse Then my high spheare aboue, whence to all mortals I shoot my thicke and troubled melancholy. Say, what's the businesse? say. Iup. Ceres, thy presence Tels me thy suit is 'bout thy daughters ape. Ceres. Is she not thine? and canst thou suffer her To be intoomb'd in hell before her time? Iuno. Cannot hell swallow your ambitious bastard? But (maugre all these monsters) liues he still? Phœb. I saw grim Pluto in my daily progresse Hurry her in his chariot ore the earth. Venus. What could he lesse do if he lou'd the Lady? Mars. Venus is all for loue. Mercu. And Mars for warre, Sometimes he runnes a tile at Venus lippes, You haue many amorous bickerings. Mars. Well spoke Mercury. Saturne. Come we hither To trifle, or to censure? what would Pluto? Pluto. Keepe whom I haue. Ceres. Canst suffer't Iupiter? Herc. I won her from the scenes of Stygian Pluto, And being mine, restore her to her mother. Ceres. And shall not Ceres keepe her? speake great Ioue Iup. Thy censure Rhadamant. Rhad. The Fates by whom your powers are all conscrib'd Pronounce this doome: If since her first arriue She hath tasted any food, she must of force Be euerlastingly confin'd to hell. Pluto. Asculaphus, thou didst attend my Queene, Hath she yet tasted of our Stygian fruits That we may keepe her still? Ascu. I saw her in her mouth chaw the moist graines of a Pomegranate. Ceres. Curst Asculaphus, Il'e adde vnto thy vglinesse, and make thee A monster, of all monsters most abhor'd. Pluto. Your censures, oh you Gods, is she not Pluto'? Giue your free censures vp. All. She must be Pluto's. Ceres. The Gods are partiall all. Pluto. Welcome my Queene. Herc. What can Alcides more for Ceres loue, Then ransacke hell, and rescue Proserpine? Needs must our further conquests here take end, When Gods and Fates against our force contend. Ceres. Iustice, oh iustice, thou Omnipotent. Rob not thy Ceres of her beauteous childe, Either restore my daughter to the earth, Or banish me to hell. Saturn. Ceres you are fond, Th'earth cannot want your plenty: your fertility Will worse become hell scortched barrennesse. Let's breake this Sessions vp, I am dull. Iup. You Gods aboue And powers below, attend the Thunderers voyce, And to our moderation lend an eare Of reuerence. Ceres, the Fates haue doom'd her The Bride of Pluto; nor is she disparaged To be the sister of Olimpicke Ioue. The rape that you call force, we title Loue: Nor is he lesse degree'd, saue in his lot, To vs that sway the heauens. So much for Pluto. Now beauteous Ceres we returne to you, Such is your care to fill the earth with plenty, To cherish all these fruits, from which the mortals Ostend their gratitude to vs the Gods In sacrifice and offrings, that we now Thus by our dread power, mittigate the strictnesse Of the Fates doome: we haue not (oh you Gods) Purpose to do our Stygian brother wrong, Nor rob the heauens the Planet of the Moone, By whom the seas are sway'd: Be she confin'd Below the earth, where be the ebbes and tides? Where is her power infus'd in hearbes and plants? In trees for buildings? simples phisicall? Or minerall mines? Therefore indifferent Ioue Thus arbitrates: the yeare we part in twelue, Cal'd Moneths of the Moone: twelue times a yeare She in full splendor shall supply her orbe, And shine in heauen: twelue times fill Pluto's armes Below in hell. When Ceres on the earth Shall want her brightnesse, Pluto shall enioy it, When heauen containes her, she shall light the earth From her bright spheare aboue. Parted so euen, We neither fauour hell, nor gloze with heauen. Plu. Pluto is pleas'd. Ceres. Ceres at length agreed. Proser. Ioue is all iustice, and hath well decreed. Iup. Say all the planets thus? All. We do. Iup. Our Sessions we dissolue then. Hercules, We limit you to dragge hence Cerberus, To the vpper world, and leaue thee to the vniuerse Where thou shalt finish all thy Iouiall taskes; Proceed and thriue. You that to earth belong, Ascend to your mortality with honors, The Gods to heauen: Pluto and his keepe hell, The Moone in both by euen attonement dwell. Exeunt three wayes Ceres, The seus, Philoctetes, and Hercules dragging Cerberus one way: Pluto, hels Iudges, the Fates and Furies downe to hell: Iupiter, the Gods and Planets ascend to heauen. Enter Homer. Our full Sceane's wane, the Moones arraignment ends, Ioue and his mount, Pluto with his descends. Poore Homer's left blinde, and hath lost his way, And knowes not if he wander or go right, Unlesse your fauours their cleare beames display. But if you daine to guide me through this night, The acts of Hercules I shall pursue, And bring him to the thrice-raz'd wals of Troy: His labours and his death Il'e shew to you. But if what's past your riper iudgements cloy, Here I haue done: if ill, too much: if well, Pray with your hands guide Homer out of hell. FINIS.</field>
