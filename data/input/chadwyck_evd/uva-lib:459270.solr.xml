      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Al thinges be not soe as in sight they doe seeme, What so euer they resemble, or what euer men deeme. For if our senses in their owne obiects vs doe fayle Sometimes, then our iudgemente shall but little auaile In some thinges as suche where doubt geueth deniall, Of them in the best wise to make any triall. Whiche sayinge is euident as well shall appeare, In this little Enterlude whiche we present heare. Whereby we may learne, how grosly wee erre Taking one thinge for an other, whiche differ so farre As good dothe from badde. Example therefore You may take by these persons if you marke no more. For the Primitiue constitution whiche was fyrst appointed Euen by God him self, and by Christ his annoynted: Confirmed by thappostles, and of great antiquitie: See howe it is peruerted by mannes wicked iniquitie, To be called newe Custome, or newe Constitucion, Surely a name of to muche vngodly abusion. Whiche our aucthor indifferently scanninge in his minde: In his simple opinion this cause hee doeth finde, That by reason of Ignorance, whiche beareth great swaie: And also stubberne Doctrine whiche shutteth vp the waie To all good Instruction, and knowledge of right: No maruell it was though of the trueth we were ignoraunt quight. For truely in suche a case, the matter was but small, To make the ignorant sowle to credite them all, What so euer they saide, were it trueth or a lye. For no man was able then to proue them the contrarie. Wherefore their owne fansies they sette in great prise, Neglectinge the trewe way, lyke men farre vnwise. Makinge semblant of antiquitie in all that they did, To thintent that their subtiltie by suche meanes might be hid. Newe Custome also hath he named this matter verilie, In consideration that the people so speaketh commonlie, Confuting the same by reasons most manifest Whiche in consequent order of talke are exprest. This sence hath our Author followed herein as we saide, For other meaning, moreouer hee will not haue it denaide, But diuerse may inuent muche distant from this, whiche in no wise hee wil haue preiudiciall to his, Nor his vnto theirs, what soeuer they bee, For many heades, many wittes wee doe plainely see. Onely hee desireth this of the worshipfull audience, To take in good parte without al manner offence: What soeuer shall be spoken, marking the intent, Interpreting it no otherwise but as it was ment. And for vs if of pacience you list to attende: Wee are readie to declare you the matter to the ende. Finis Prologi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus. 1. Scena. 1. Peruerse Doctrine and Ignorance entre. Peruerse Doctrine. It is euen so in deede, the worlde was neuer in so euyll a state. But this is no time for vs of these matters to debate. It were good wee inuented some politike waie Our matters to addresse in good orderly staie. And for vs, reason would wee loked to our selues. Do you not see howe these newe fangled pratling elfes, Prinke vp so pertly of late in euery place? And go about vs auncients flatly to deface? As who shoulde say in shorte time, as well learned as wee, As wise to the worlde, as good they mighte accoumptid bee. Naye, naye, if many yeeres, and graie heares do knowe no more: But that euery peuishe boye hath euen as muche witte in store: By the masse then haue I lyued to long, and I would I were dead If I haue not more knoweledge then a thousande of th? in my head. For how should they haue learning that were borne but euen now? As fit a sighte it were to see a goose shodde, or a sadled cowe, As to heare the pratlinge of any suche iacke strawe. For when hee hath all done I compte him but a very dawe. As in London not longe since you wot well where, They rang to a Sermon, and wee chaunced to be there. Up start the preacher I thinke not past twenty yeeres olde. With a sounding voyce, and audacitie bolde, And beganne to reuile at the holie sacrament, and transubstanciation. I neuer hearde one knaue or other make suche a declaration. But, but if I had had the boye in a conuenient place, With a good rodde, or twaine not past one howres space? I woulde so haue scourged my marchant that his breeche should ake, So longe as it is since that hee those woordes spake? What? younge men to be medlers in Diuinitie? it is a godly sight. Yet therein nowe almost is euery boyes delight, No booke nowe in their handes, but all scripture, scripture. Eyther the whole Bible, or the newe Testament you may be sure. The newe Testament for them? and then to for cowle my dogge. This is the olde prouerbe, to cast perles to an hogge. Geue them that whiche is meete for them, a racket, and a ball, Or some other trifle to busie their heades with all. Playinge at coytes, or nine hooles, or shooting at buttes, There let them be a goddes name, til their hartes ake &amp; their guttes. Let vs alone with Diuinitie whiche are of ryper age. Youth is rashe they say, but olde men hath the knowledge. For while they reade they knowe not what, they omit the veritie, And that is nowe the cause so many fall into heresie Euery man hath his owne way, some that, and some this, It wolde almost for anger surreuerence make a man to pisse To heare what they talke of in open communication, Surely I feare me Ignorance this geare wyl make some desolation. Ignor?ce. I feare the same also, but as towching that wherof you speake ful-well: They haue reuoked diuerse olde heresies out of hell. As against Transubstantiation, Purgatory, and the Masse, And say that by scripture they can not be brought to passe. But that whiche euer hath ben a most trewe, and constant opinion, And defended also hitherto, by all of our religion, That I Ignorance am the mother of true deuotion, And Knowledge the auctour of the contrarie affection: They denie it so stoutely as thoughe it were not so. But this hath ben beleft many an hundred yeere ago. Wherefore it greueth mee not a lyttle that my case should so stande, Thus to be disproued at euery pratlers hande. Peruerse Doctrine. Yea doth? then the more vnwiseman you, as I trowe, For they say as muche by mee, as you well do knowe. And shall I then go vexe my selfe at theyr talke? No let them speake so longe as their tongues can walke. They shall not greue mee, for why? in very south It were follie to endeuour to stop euery mannes mouth. They haue brought in one, a younge vpstart ladde as it appeares. I am sure he hath not ben in the Realme very many yeares. With a gathered frocke, a powlde head, and a broade hatte, An vnshaued bearde, a pale face, and hee teacheth that All our doinges are naught, and hath ben many a day. Hee disaloweth our ceremonies, and rites, and teacheth an other way To serue God, then that whiche wee do vse. And goeth about the peoples myndes to seduce. It is a pestilent knaue, hee wyll haue priestes no corner capppes to weare. Surplices, are superstition, beades, paxes, and suche other geare, Crosses, belles, candells, oyle, bran, salt, spettle, and incense, With sensing, and singing hee accomptes not worth iii. halfpense, And cries out on them all, if to repete them I wist Suche holy thinges wherein our religion doth consist. But hee commaundes the seruice in English to be readde. And for the holy Legende the Bible too put in his steadde. Euery man to looke thereon at his list and pleasure. Euery man to studie diuinitie at his conuenient leasure. With a thoousand newe guises more you knowe as well as I. And to terme him by his right name, if I shoulde not lie: It is newe Custome, for so they do him call Bothe our sister Hipocrisie, Superstition, Idolatrie, and all? And truely me thinketh they do iustly, and wisely therein, Since hee is so diuers, and so lately crept in. Ignor?ce. So they call him in deede you haue saide ryght well, Because hee came newely from the deuyll of hell, Newe Custome quod you? now a vengeance of his newe nose, For bringing in any suche vnaccustomed glose. For hee hath seduced the people by mightie greate flockes. Bodie of God it were good to set the knaue in the stockes. Or elles to whyp him for an exaumple to all roges as hee, How they the aucthors of newe heresies bee. Or henceforth do attempt any suche strange deuise. Let him keepe him selfe from my handes if hee be wyse. If euer I may take him within my rayne Hee is sure to haue whipping cheere for his payne. For hee doth muche harme in eache place throughout the lande. Wherefore Peruerse doctrine, heere nedeth your hande, I meane that ye be diligent in any case, If ye fortune to come where Newcustome is in place: So to vse the villaine, you know what I meane, That in all poyntes you may discredite him cleane. And when hee beginnes of any thynge for to clatter: Of any controuersie of learnyng, or Diuinitie matter: So to cling fast vnto euery mannes thought: That his woordes may seeme heresie, and his doinges but nought. Peruerse doctrine. Tushe let mee alone with that, for I haue not so lyttle wit, But I haue practised this alreadie, and minde also to do it. Yet a further deuise I haue I thinke not amisse. Harken to mee Ignorance, for the matter is this. For the better accomplishing our subtiltie pretended: It were expedient that bothe our names were amended. Ignorance shal be Simplicitie, for that comes very nie. And for Peruersedoctrine I wyll be called Soundedoctrine I. And nowe that wee are both in suche sorte named: Wee may goe in any place and neuer be blamed. See then you remembre your name sir Simplicitie. And mee at euery woorde Soundedoctrine to be. Beware of tripping, but looke in minde that you beare, Your fayned name, and what before you weare. But who is this that hitherwarde doth walke? Let vs stande still to heare what hee wyll talke. Scena. 2. New Custome, entreth alone. New Custome. When I consider the auncient times before, That haue ben these eyght hundred yeeres and more: And those conferre with these our later dayes: My minde do these displease a thousand waies. For sure hee that hath bothe perceaued aright: Wyll say they differ as darkenes dothe from light. For then playne dealing beare away the price, All thinges were ruled by men of good aduise. Conscience preuayled muche, euen euery where, No man deceiued his neybour, and eke a thing full rare, It was to finde a man you might not trust. But looke what once they promised: they did that well, and iust. If neighbours were at variance they ran not streight to lawe. Daiesmen tooke vp the matter, and cost not them a strawe. Suche delight they had to kyll debate, and strife. And surely euen in those dayes was there more godlier life. Howbeit men of all ages are wonted to dispraise The wickednesse of time that florished at their daies, As well hee may discerne who for that but lightly lookes In euery leafe almost of all their bookes. For as for Christ our maister, what hee thought of Iewes: And after hym thapostles, I thinke it is no newes. Peruersd. Harke Simplicitie hee is some preacher I wyll lay my gowne. Hee mindeth to make a sermon within this towne Hee speaketh honestly yet, but surely if hee rayle at mee: I may not abide him by the masse I promise thee. New cust. Paule to the Corinthians plainely doth tell That their behauiour pleased him not well. All our forefathers likewise haue ben offended, With diuerse faultes at their time, that might haue ben amended. The doctours of the Churche, great faulte they dyd fynde, In that men liued not after their mynde. First with the rulers as examples of sinne, Then with the people as continuing therin. So that of them both this one thing they thought, That the people was not good, but the rulers were naught. But in comparison of this time of miserie, In those daies men lyued in perfecte felicitie. Saincte Paule prophecied that worse tymes shoulde ensue. In nouissimis venient quidam saith hee, this is trewe, Folowinge all mischiefe, vngodlinesse, and euyll, Leaning to all wickednesse, and doctrine of the deuyll. And spake hee not of these daies thinke you I praye? The proofe is so playne that no man can denaye. For this is sure, that neuer in any age before, Naughtines, and sinne hath ben practised more, Or halfe so muche, or at all, in respecte, so I saye As is nowe (God amende all,) at this present daye. Sinne nowe, no sinne, faultes no faultes a whit. O God, seest thou this, and yet wylt suffer hit? Surely thy mercie is great, but yet our sinnes I feare, Are so great, that of Iustice with them thou canst not beare. Adulterie no vice, it is a thinge so rife, A stale iest nowe, to lie with an other mannes wyfe. For what is that but daliaunce? Couetousnesse they call Good husbandrie, when one man would faine haue all. And eke a like to that is vnmercifull extorcion, A sinne in sight of god, of great abhomination. For Pride that is now a grace, for rounde about, The humble sprited is termed a foole, or a lowte. Who so will bee so drunken that hee scarsly knoweth his waye, Oh hee is a good fellowe, so now a daies they saye. Gluttonie is Hospitalitie, while they meate, and drinke spill, Whiche would relieue diuerse whom famine doth kill. As for all charitable deedes they be gone God knoweth, Some pretende lacke but the chiefe cause is slowth, A vice most outragiouse of all others sure, Right hatefull to God, and contrarie to nature, Scarse bloud is punished, but euen for very shame, So make they of murther but a trifling game. O how manie examples of that horrible Uice Do dayly among vs nowe spring and arise? But thankes be to God that such rulers doth sende, Whiche earnestly studie that fault to amende. As by the sharpe punishement of that wicked crime Wee may see that committed was but of late time, God direct their heartes they may alwaies continue Suche iust execution on sinne to ensue. So shall be saued the life of many a man: And God wyll withdrawe his sore plagues from vs than. Theft is but pollicie, Periurie but a face, Suche is now the worlde, so farre men be from grace. But what shall I say of Religion and knowledge Of God, whiche hath ben indifferent in eache age Before this? howbeit his faltes then it had, And in some poyntes then was culpable, and bad? Surely this one thinge I may say aright, God hath reiected vs away from him quight, And geuen vs vp whollie vnto our owne thought, Utterly to destroy vs, and bring vs to nought. For do they not followe the inuentions of men? Looke on the Primitiue Churche, and tell mee then, Whether they serued God in this same wise, Or whether they followed any other guyse? For since Goddes feare decayed, and Hypocrisie crept in, In hope of some gaines, and lucre to win: Crueltie bare a stroke, who with fagot and fier, Braught all thinges to passe that hee did desier. Next Auarice spilt all, whiche lest it should be spide: Hypocrisie ensued the matter to hide. Then brought they in their monsters, their Masses, their Light, Their Torches at noone, to darken our sight. Their Popes, and their pardones, their Purgatories for sowles, Their smoking of the Church, and flinging of cooles. Ignor?ce. Stay yet a whyle, and let vs heare more communication. Peruersd. I can not by goddes sowle, if I might haue all this nation. Shall I suffer a knaue thus to rayle, and prate? Nay, then I pray god the deuyll breake my pate, I will be reuenged or hee depart away. Ah surrah you haue made a feire speake heere to day. Do you looke for any rewarde for your deede? It were good to beate thee till thy head bleede, Or to scourge thee welfauouredlie at a cartes tayle, To teache suche an horeson to blaspheme, and rayle At suche holie misteries, and matters so hie As thou speakest of nowe, and rayledst at so latelie. New cust. What meane ye sir, or to whom do you speake? Are ye minded on mee your anger to wreake, Whiche haue not offended as farre as I knowe? Peruersd. I speake to thee knaue, thou art madde I trowe. What meanst thou to raile right now so contemptuously, At the chefest secretes of all Diuinitie? New cust. Uerelie I railed not so farre as I can tell, I spake but aduisedly, I knowe very well. For I wyll stande to it, what so euer I sayde, Peruersd. Wilt thou soe? but I will make thee well apaide, To recant thy woordes I holde thee a pounde, Before thou departe hence out of this grounde. New cust. No that shall you not doe if I die therefore. Peruersd. Thou shalt see anone, go too, prattle no more, But tell mee theffect of the woordes whiche were sayde. New cust. To recite them agayne, I am not afrayde: I sayde that the Masse, and suche trumperie as that, Popery, Purgatorie, pardons were flatt Against Goddes woorde, and Primitiue Constitution, Crept in through Couetousnesse, and superstition, Of late yeres, through Blindenes, and men of no knowledge, Euen suche as haue ben in euery age. Peruersd. Now preciouse horeson thou hast made a lie. Howe canst thou proue that tell me by and by. New cust. It needeth small profe, the effect doth appere, Neither this is any place for to argue here. And as for my saying I holde the negatiue. It lyeth you vpon to proue the affirmatiue, To shewe that such thinges were vsed in antiquitie, And then I can easely proue you the contrarie. Peruersd. Standst thou with mee on schole poyntes, dost thou so in deede? Thou hadst best to proue mee whether I can reede. Thinkest thou I haue no Logique, in deede thinkest thou soe? Yes prinkockes, that I haue, for fortie yeares agoe I coulde smatter in a Duns pretelie I do not ieste, Better I am sure then an hundred of you, who so euer is the best. New cust. Truelie I beleeue you, for in suche fonde bookes You spent idellie your time, and weried your lookes. More better it had ben in bookes of holie Scripture, Where as Uertue is expressed, and Religion pure, To haue passed your youth, as the Bible and suche. Then in these trifles to haue dolted so muche. Not more to haue regarded a Duns, or a Questionist, Then you would the woordes of the holie Euangelist. Peruersd. What? for a Childe to meddle with the Bible? New cust. Yea sure more better, then so to be idle. Peruersd. Is studie then idlenes? that is a new terme. New cust. They say better to be idle then to do harme: Peruersd. What harme dothe knowledge I pray thee tel mee? New cust. Knowledge puffeth vp, in Saincte Paule you may see. Peruersd. Yee but what knowledge meaneth hee, tell mee that? New cust. Euen such knowledge as yee professe flat. For the truthe, and the Gospell you haue in contempt, And followe suche toyes as your selues do inuent. Forsaking Goddes lawes, and thappostles institution, In all your procedinges, and matters of Religion. Peruersd. By what speakest thou that let me here thy iudgement? New cust. Not by any gesse, but by that whiche is euident. As for the Scriptures you haue abolished cleane, New fashions you haue constitute in Religion, agayne Abuse of the Sacraments then hath ben tofore, Haue you brought, and in nombre haue you made them more, Then Christ euer made: Wherfore shew your auctoritie: Or els haue you done to the Churche great iniurie. Thappostles neuer taught your transubstantiation Of bread into fleshe, or any suche fashion. Howe be it they were conuersant euery day, and hower, And receiued that Sacrament of Christ our sauiour. You feigne also that Peter was bishop of Rome, And that hee first instituted the seate of your Popedome. But Peruerse nation, howe dare you for shame, Your fansies on Christ, and thappostles to frame? Peruersd. Marie auaunt Iackesauce, and pratling knaue. I will coniure thy cote if thou leaue not to raue. With all my harte and auengeance come vp and be nought. I see wee shall haue an heretike of thee as I thought. These thinges were approued or thou wast borne, dost thou not see? And shall be when thou art hanged I warrant thee. New cust. Ere I was borne? nay sure that is not trewe. For in comparison of mee they be but newe. Peruersd. Of thee? ha ha ha, what of thee? thou art mad. New cust. Surely in my sorte I am bothe sobre, and sad. Peruersd. Whie how olde art thou, tell mee I pray thee hartely? New cust. Older then you I perceiue. Peruersd. What older then I? The younge knaue by the masse not fully thirtie, Woulde be elder then I that am aboue sixtie? New cust. A thousande, and a halfe, that surely is my age. Aske and enquire of all men of knowlage. Peruesd. A thousand yeares? odde? preciouse sowle I am out of my wittes. Hee is possessed of some deuyll or of some euill sprites. Why thou art a young knaue, of that sorte I saye, That brought into this realme but the other daye, This new learning, and these heresies, and suche other things moe, With strange guises inuented now long agoe. And I pray thee tell mee, is not thy name Newcustome? New cust. Trewly so I am called of some. As of suche as wante both witte, and vnderstanding, As you do nowe I knowe by your talking. But woe be to those that make no distinction, Betweene many thinges of diuerse condition. As naught to be good, and hotte to be colde. And olde to be newe, and new to be olde. Wherefore these disceytes you dayly inuent, The people to seduce, vnto your aduertisement, While with tales you assay, and with lies you begyn, The truth to deface, and your credite to wyn. Peruersd. What is thy name then I pray thee make declaration. New cust. In fayth my name is Primitiue constitution. Peruersd. Who? who? Praua Constitutio? euen so I thought, I wist that it was some suche thinge of nought. Like Lettuse like lippes, a scabd horse for a scald squire. New cust. Primitiue constitution I saide if you heare, Suche orders as in the Primitiue churche heretofore Were vsed, but not nowe, the more pittie therefore. Peruersd. Ah, ah in good time sir wel might you fare Primitiue Constituti?, That is your trewe name you say without all delution. Primitiue Constitution (quodes stowe) as muche as my sleeue, The deuill on him which will such liers beleeue. For my parte if I credite such an hearie mowle, The fowle fende of hell fetche mee bodie, and sowle. New cust. Trueth can not preuaile, where Ignorance is in place. Ignor?ce. Peace, or I will lay my beades on thie face, Hast thou nothing to raile at, but Ignorance I trowe? New cust. You may vse mee euen at your pleasure I knowe. For Peruerse doctrine that is rooted soe fast, That it may not be changed at no heauenlie blast: May not heare the contrarie, but beginneth to kicke, Like a iade when hee feleth the spurre for to pricke. Peruersd. Yee? saist thou soe thou miscreant villaine? A little thing would make mee knocke out thy brayne. Hence out of my sight, away, packing, trudge, Thou detestable heretike, thou caytife, thou drudge. If I may take thee it were as good thou weare deade, For euen with this Portuse I will battre thy heade. Exit. Thoughe I hang therefore I care not I, So I be reuenged on a slaue ere I die. Sacrament of God, who hath hearde suche a knaue? Who after hee had doone at Ignorance to raue: Peruerse doctrine (quod hee) is also rooted so fast That hee may be changed by no heauenly blast. No goddes sowle I warrant him I will see him rotten, Before that my Doctrine I shall haue forgotten. Wherefore it behoueth vs some councell to take, Howe wee the stronger our matters may make. Against the surprise of this newe inuasion, Begunne of late by this strange generation, Of Newcustome and his makes, meaning to deface Our auncient rightes, and Religion, and to place Their deuelishe doctrine the Gospell, and soe Our gaines to debate, and our selues to vndoe. I thinke it best therefore that our sister Hypocrisie Do vnderstand fully of this matter by and by. Let vs goe and seeke her the case for to shewe That wee her good councell may spedely knowe. Ignor?ce. I am readie, in folowing I will not be slowe. Exiunt. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus. 2. Scena. 1. Light of the Gospell, and Newcustome enter. Light of the gospel Doubt you nothing at all, for God will so prouide, Who leaueth not his elect to defende, and to guide: That where euer I come suche grace you may finde, As shall in eache poynte content well your minde. And admit that they not call you Newcustome, what then? Attribute that follie to the ignorance of men, That followe their fansies, and know not the right. Well, you knowe where I come once the light Of the Gospell whose beames do glister so cleare: Then primitiue constitution in eache place you appeare. And as elsewhere you haue ben, so do not mistrust But in this place hereafter be receued you must. New cust. According to your nature so do you very well, To put mee in good hope, bright Light of the Gospel. And seing you be trewe, I may in no wise Misdeeme you the father, or aucthour of lies. For if trust to the Gospell do purchase perpetuaunce Of life vnto him who therein hath confidence: What shall the light doe? whose beames be so bright: That in eache respect all thinges else of light, Are but very darkenes, and eke terrestriall, So the light of the Gospell ouershineth them all. Wherefore with great comforte I receiue your counsell, With hartie thankes vnto you, the light of the Gospell. Light of the gospel Do so, and by Faith then shall you obtaine What so euer you desire, the Scripture saith plaine. For quicquid petieritis in nomine meo. It must of trueth needes be vnderstode soe, That without Faith what so euer wee fortune to craue: Wee may not looke for it our desire to haue. Faith moueth mountaines so it be pure faith in deede, By Fayth wee obtaine what so euer wee neede. Then Faith shall restore to you more thinges then this, Beleue mee Primitiue constitution, what so euer is amisse. But where be those reprobates deuoyde of all grace, Who lately misused you, as you saide in this place? New Cu. They be sodenly departed, I wote not well whether, For I left them right now bothe heere together, They can not be farre hence I know very well, Where they be there is none if we aske, but can tell. Light of Do you knowe them agayne if you meete them aright? New cust. Yea sir that I doe euen at the first sight. Light of Then let vs not tarie, but goe seeke them straite. New cust. At hande I am readie on you for to wayte. Scena. 2. Hypocrisie, Peruersedoctrine, and Ignorance entre. Hipocri. Peruersedoctrine I say, take heede in any sorte That thou neuer beleue what so euer they reporte, Though they of the Gospell neuer so muche do preache, Euery man will not credite what so euer they teache. They will not say all beleeue, when they do not I promise thee: For that time will neuer come in this world trust mee. Tushe, tushe, be thou busied in any case To discredite their preachinge, in euery place. If they teache them one thing, then teache thou the contrarie. And if that no Scripture for thy place thou haue readie: In woordes that supplie whiche wanteth in reason, For ill thinges applied somtime in good season: As of better eftsones do importe the wayte, So they be well ordred by good pollicie, and slayght. How be it their doctrine be sounde: yet their vices fynd out, As this is a slouen, or this is a lowte. Hee speaketh on enuie, suche a one for neede, This saith it in woordes, but hee thinketh it not in deede. Upon greatter occasion they sticke not to raue. Saying this is a whooremaster, villaine, hee an Heretike knaue, An Extorcioner, a theefe, a traytour, a murtherer, A couetous person, a common Userer. This hee doth for my mistresse his wyues sake by the roode, The beiter to mainteine and supporte the frenchehoode. Remember also that it weare a great shame, For thee for to haue forgotten thy owne name. Peruersedoctrine of right must the trueth so peruerte: That hee neuer let it sinke into any mannes harte, As farre as hee can with diligence withstande, For euer it behoueth thee to be readie at hande, To strenthen thine owne partes, and disproue other doctrine, What so euer shall be taught that is contrarie to thine. Still pretende Religion what so euer you say, And that shall get thee good credite alway, Pleasing the multitude with suche kinde of grace. As with them to the whiche most enclined they are. Square cappes, longe gownes, with tippettes of silke, Braue coopes in the churche, surplices as white as milke, Beades, and suche like, all these beare the price. To these thinges applie thy attendant deuise. And other likewise which well you do knowe, Whiche all of great holinesse do set forthe a shewe. Though some of them doubtlesse be indifferent, what matter, They furnishe our businesse neuer the latter. For these of antiquitie since that they do smell: Our cause must commend right wonderfull well. And these be the thinges wherof thou hast neede. The better of thy wyl, and purpose to speede. Then geue thy attendance, and so be sure of this. That I will be readie and neuer wyll misse, To assist thee still in workinge thy purpose, To thaduauncing of thee, and depressing thy foes. Peruersd. Gramercie good Sister euen with all my hearte, For this your good councell, and for my parte What so euer in this case may bee possibly donne: I shall followe your preceptes as a naturall sonne. For the matter so standes if wee looke not well about, That wee quite perishe all out of doubt. Unlesse some suche way wee take out of hande: Whereby wee may be able our foes to withstande. And for this cause my brother Ignorance and I: Lest it should chaunce vs to fall into ieoperdie: Through enuie of our names in any mannes eare: For this intent I say wee did diligently care, Our names to counterfaite, in suche maner sorte: That where euer wee goe wee may win good reporte. Hipocri. Of my faith that is very well done in deede. God sende thee a good wit still at thy neede. And that in thy doinges suche successe thou maist fynde: That all thinges may chaunce to thee after thy minde. My brother if thou haue ought else for to say, Speake on or that I departe hence away. Peruersd. Great thankes for your councel, and if yee chaunce to go thyther, You may meete with Ignorance: to hasten him hyther. Hypocri. Farewell, hee shall be here, you shall see euen anon. Peruersd. Alacke, alacke, now my good sister is gon. Whose presence to enioye is more pleasant vnto mee, Than any thing what so euer in the worlde coulde bee. Good occasion haue I suche a sister to embrace, For by her meanes I lyue, and enioye this place. Which yet I possesse as longe as I may, And haue heretofore many a faire day. For since these new Heretikes the deuill take them all, In all corners began to barke, and to ball: At the Catholike Faith, and the olde religion. Making of them bothe but matters of derision: Hypocrisie hath so helped at euery neede: That but for her hardly were wee lyke for to speede. For be our case neuer so nye driuen to the worst, Through her meanes by some meane take no place at the first: Yet some meanes doth shee finde, by some meanes at the length, That her waies do preuaile and her matters get strength. Shee can finde out a thousand guyles in a trice, For euery purpose a newe strong deuise. No matter so difficile for man to finde out, No businesse so daungerous, no person so stowt, But of thone shee is able a solucion to make, And thothers greate peryll, and moode for to slake. And in fine muche matter in fewe woordes to containe: Shee can finde out a cloke for euery rayne. What person is there that beareth more swaie, In all maner of matters at this present daye, Throughout the whole world, though of symple degree, And of small power to sight shee seeme for to bee? Consider all trades, and condicions of lyfe. Then shall you perceiue that Hipocrisie is rife To all kinde of men, and of euery age: So farre as their yeeres them therein may geue knowledge: Lo here a large fielde where at length hee may walke, Who list of this matter at the full for to talke, To declare of what power, and of what efficacie, In euery age, countrey and time is Hypocrisie. But I may not about suche small pointes now stande, The affaires they be greater that I haue in hande. Ignorance is the cause that I so longe tarie heere, And beholde where the blinde Bussard doth appeere. Come on thou grosse headed knaue, thou whoroson asse I say, Where hast thou ben sence wee departed to day? Ignor?ce. Where haue I ben quod you? mary euen there I was, Where as I would haue geuen an hundred pounde by the Masse To haue ben here, for neuer sence the day I was borne, Was I so neere hande in peeces for to haue ben torne. For as I was going vp and downe in the streete: To see if I coulde with Hypocrisie meete? Beeholde a farre of I began to espie, That heretike Newcustome, with an other in his companie. As soone as they sawe mee: they hyde them a pace, Came towardes, and met mee full in the face. I am glad wee haue founde you then quod this heretike knaue, For you, and your fellowe this day sought wee haue In euery place, and now can not you flie, And with these woordes bothe they came very nie. Whereat I so feared I may tell you playne: That I thought at that howre I should haue ben slayne. This is hee quod the varlet, of whom I tolde you of late, An Enemie of the trewth, and incensed with hate Against God and his Churche, and an impe of Hypocrisie, A foe to the Gospell, and to trewe Diuinitie. Thou lyest heretique quod I, and naught elles coulde I say, But brake quickely from them, and hither came away. Peruersd. Who is hee that was with him Simplicitie, canst thou tell? Ignor?ce. Not I sure, but some call him the Light of the Gospell. A good personable fellowe, and in countenaunce so bright: That I coulde not beholde him in the visage aright. Peruersd. Goddes preciouse woundes that slaue, marie fie on him fie, Body of our Lorde is hee come into the countrye? I thinke all the Heretiques in the worlde haue taken in hande, By some solemne othe to pester this lande, With their wicked Scismes and abhominable sectes, Now a vengeance on them all, and the Deuyll breake their neckes. Light of the Gospel? light of a straw, yet what euer hee bee, I wolde hee were hanged as hie as I can see. Ignor?nce. What haue you hearde of him before this? Peruersd. Heard of hym? yee that haue I often iwis. If there be any in the worlde it is this horeson theefe, Beleeeue mee Simplicitie, that will worke vs the mischiefe. Hath that same new Iacke gotte him suche a mate? Now with all my heart a pestilence on his pate. I woulde they were both hanged fairely together, Or elles were at the deuill, I care not muche whether. For since these Geneuian doctours came so fast into this lande, Since that time it was neuer merie with Englande. First came Newcustome, and hee gaue the onsay, And sithens thinges haue gone worse euery day. But Simplicitie dost thou knowe what is mine intent? Ignor?ce. Tell mee, and I shall knowe what you haue ment. Peruersd. Our matters with Creweltie our friende to discusse, And to here him, what counsell in this case hee will geue vs. And this is the cause I haue taried for thee, Because that to him I would haue thee goe with mee. But see where hee commeth with Auarice sadly walking, Let vs listen, if wee can, whereof they be talkinge. Scena. 3. Creweltie, Auarice entre, Peruersedoctrine, and Ignorance tarie. Crueltie. Nay by Goddes harte, if I might doe what I list, Not one of them all that should scape my fist. His nayles I would Plague them one way, or an other. I would not misse him, no if hee were mine owne brother. With small faultes I might beare as I sawe occasion, And punishe, or forgeue, at mine owne discretion, For I wote that sometime the wisest may fall. But Heresie, fie on that, that is the greatest of all. Euery stockes should be full, euery prison, and iayle. Some would I beate with roddes, some scorge at a cartes tayle. Some hoyse their heeles vpwarde, some beate in a sacke, Some manickle their fingers, some binde in the racke. Some would I sterue for hunger, some would I hange priuilie. Saying that them selues so dyed desperately. Some would I accuse of matters of great weight, Openly to hange them as trespassours streight. A thousand mo waies could I tell, and not misse, Whiche here in England I may say to you I haue practised ere this, And trust by his woundes, Auarice, some agayne for to trie How so euer the world goe before that I die. Auarice. Now I will tel thee Crueltie, by goddes sacrament I haue swore, It were pittie but thou were hanged before. Crueltie. Ha, ha, ha, I had as liefe they were hanged as I, By the masse there is one thing makes me laugh hartely, ha, ha, ha. Auarice. I pray thee what is that? Crueltie. What? ha, ha, ha, I can not tel for laughinge I wold neuer better pastime desier Then to here a dosen of them howling together in the fier. Whose noyse as my thinketh I could best compare: To a crie of houndes folowing after the Hare. Or a rablement of Bandogges barking at a Beare, ha, ha, ha. Auarace. I beshrew thy knaues fingers with my very hearte, The deuill will reward thee, whose darling thou arte. But sirra I pray thee if it had chanced me in those daies in thy handes to haue fel, I thinke sure thou wouldst haue ordred mee well. Crueltie. His bloud I would I might haue once seene that chaunce, I would haue vext thee with a vengeaunce for olde aqueintaunce. Auarice. Why so, I was alwaies thy furderer in those daies I am sure. Crueltie. Yee, but what was the cause? thine owne profite to procure. For so that thou mighest vauntage, and lucre obtaine: Thou wouldest not sticke to bring thine owne brother to payne. Auarice. Ha, ha, ha, no nor father, and mother if there were ought to be got, Thou mightest sweare: if I could I would bring them to the pot. Whereof a like Historie I shall tell thee Crueltie. In Englande which my selfe plaied in the daies of queene Marie. Twoo brothers there were dwelling young gentilmen, but the heyre Had substanciall reuenewes, his stocke also was faire. A man of good conscience, and studious of the Gospell. Which the other brother perceiuing very well, Perswaded him by all meanes since hee was so bent, To be constant in opinion, and not to relent. Which done, hee gaue notice to the officers about, Howe they should come with searche to finde his brother out. Who, when hee was once in this sorte apprehended, Shortly after his life in the fier hee ended. The other had the most part of all his lyuinge, How saist sir knaue? is not this the next way to thriuinge? Crueltie. O vnreasonable Auarice vnsaciable with gayne. Auarice. What this? tushe it was but a merie trayne. Crueltie. For lukers sake his owne brother to betraye? Hence Iudas, with these doinges I can not awaye. Auarice, I was euer with him still readie at hande, Continually suggesting of the house and the lande, And yet to tell you the trueth, as in deede the thinge is, Of my conscience I thinke the best part was his. Crueltie. By goddes glorious woundes hee was worthy of none? But thou to be whipped for thy greedie suggestion. Auarice. Harte of god man by the meanes better, or worse, I passe not I, so it be good for the purse, ha, ha, ha, Peruersd. If you loue the purse so well Auarice, as you say in deede, Then helpe mee with your councell now at a neede. Auarice. What Peruersedoctrine? &amp; Ignorance too? were you both so neere? Wee had thought at our comming that no man had ben heere. Ignor?ce. Wee haue ben in this place euer since that you staide, And wee haue hearde also, what so euer you haue sayde. Crueltie. Welcome bothe on my faith, and I am glad it was our chaunce, To meete with you here Peruersdoctrine, and Ignorance. Whie? how gothe the worlde? my thinkes you be sad? Peruersd. Mary god haue mercie, but there is small cause to be glad. For excepte you come speedely with your helping hande, No doubt wee shall shortly be banished the lande. Auarice. Whie so Peruersdoctrine? Crueltie. I pray thee let mee vnderstande. Peruersd. Whie so? you knowe howe since Herisie came lately in place, And Newe custome that vile Scismatique, began to deface All our olde doings, our seruice, our rites, that of yore Haue bene of great price in the olde time before: Our selues haue bene enforced almost for to flye, The countrie, or else couertly in some corner to lye. Crueltie. By the Masse that is trewe, for I dare not appeere, Who so euer would geeue mee. xx.li. landes by the yeere. Auarice. Ha, ha, ha, by goddes foote and I was neuer in better case in my lif, For Couetousnes with the Clergie was neuer so rife. Wherefore I haue no cause in suche sort to be greeued, Yet I woulde I could tell sirs howe you might be releeued. Peruersd. Nowe sirha to mende vp this matter withall: Preciouse God it frettes mee to the very gall. For nowe of late that slaue, that varlet, that heretique, Lighte of the Gospell, Is come ouer the Sea, as some credibly tell. Whom Newcustome doth vse in all matters as a staie, The most ennemie to vs in the worlde alway. whose rancour is suche, and so great is his spight: That no doubt hee will straight way banishe vs quight, Unlesse wee prouide some remedie for the contrary, And with speede, this is treuth that I tell thee Crueltie. Crueltie. His woundes, hart, and bloud, is hee come without any naye? Ignor?ce. Yee verely, for with these eyes I sawe him to daye, Crueltie. Now I would hee were here, I woulde so dresse the slaue, That I warrant hee should beare mee a marke to his graue. First I woulde buffet him, thus, then geue him a fall, Afterwarde I would dashe out his braynes at the wall. Auarice. Holde your handes you rude knaue or by goddes bodie I sweare, I wyll quickely fetche my fist from your care. Peruersd. Tushe tushe it auailes naught, to chafe, nor to chide, It were more wisedome with speede some redresse to prouide. Crueltie. Redresse? nowe by goddes guttes I will neuer staye, Tyll I finde meanes to ridde the beast out of the waye. I wyll cut him of the slampambes I holde him a crowne, Where so euer I meete him, in countrie, or towne. Ignor?ce. What order you will take it were best make relation, For moe wittes as you knowe, may do better then one. Crueltie. I wyll do then what so euer shall come in my head, I force not I, so the vyllaine were dead. Auarace. And of my furtherance, what so euer I may do you, be sure, Your good state againe, if I can, to procure, With my vttermost helpe to suppresse yonder Rascall, For by the masse you Papists I like best of all. Peruersd. Then can wee not doo amisse I coniecture lightly, For where as al these come, Peruersdoctrine, Auarice, Ignorance, &amp; Cruelty: There goeth the hare, except all good lucke goe awrie. But sirs it is good, lest your names you discrie, To transpose them after some other kinde, Els bee sure with the people much hatred to finde. As for Peruersedoctrine, sounde doctrine: for Ignorance, Simplicitee With these coulours of late our selues cloked haue wee. Crueltie. What then shall I Crueltie bee called in your iudgement? Peruersd. Mary Iustice with Seueritie, a vertue most excellent. Auarice. What will you terme Auarice, I pray you let mee heare? Peruersd. Euen Frugalitie, for to that vertue it commeth most neare. Auarice. Contente by his woundes I, but wee must looke to our feete, Least wee stumble in these names when so euer wee meete. Peruersd. Yea see you take heede to that in any manner of case, So may you delude the people in euery place. Crueltie. Come then it is time hence that away wee departe. Ignor?ce. Wee are redie to follow, with a most willyng hart. Auarice. But sirs, because wee haue taried so longe: If you bee good fellowes, let vs depart with a songe. Crueltie. I am pleased, and therefore let euery man Follow after in order as well as hee can. The first Songe. Well handled by the masse on euery side. Come Auarice, for wee twoo will no longer abide. Peruersd. Farewell to you bothe, and God sende you successe, Suche as may glad vs all in your present businesse. Now they bee departed, and wee may not tary, For it lieth vs vpon all to bee sturryng by S. Mary. New Custome preuayleth much euery where, But no matter, they bee fooles that doo geeue him suche eare. Let olde Custome preuayle rather, it is better then new, This all will confesse, that thinke Scripture is true. Doo as thy Fathers haue doone before thee (quoth hee) Then shalt thou bee certayne in the right way to bee. And sure that is betttr then to follow the trayne That eche man inuenteth of his owne proper brayne. Whiche hath brought the worlde to this case, as wee see, That euery day wee heere of some notorious heresie. Yet all is the Gospell what so euer they say. Well if it chaunce that a dogge hath a daye, Woe then to Newcustome, and all his mates, tushe, tushe, No man the Gospell will esteeme then a rushe. What will that other Heretike do Light of the Gospel I pray? Dare not once shewe his face more then wee at this day. But come Ignorance let vs follow after apace, For wee haue abidden all to long in this place. Ignor?ce. Let vs go then, but by the Masse I am vengeance drie, I pray thee let vs drinke at the alehouse herebie. Peruersd. Content in fayth, thither with speede let vs hie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus. 3. Scena. 1. Light of the Gospell, Newcustome, Peruerse doctrine. Light of the gospel They be not this way as farre as I can see: Unlesse they haue hidden them selues vp priuilie. For in presence of Light of the Gospel, and Primatiue Constitution: Undoubtedly such reprobates can haue no habitation New cust. Uerely I do finde it so euen as you haue saide, For at your sight they all flie away as dismaide. Wherefore I haue great cause to geeue you thankes Light Of the Gospell, that put thus my Enemies to flight. Light of. Nay they be my enemies also, that be enemies to you, In so muche as your dealinges be both vertuouse, and true. For what is the Gospell else wherof I am Light, But Trewth, Equitie, Ueritie, and Right? They be enemies to God too, and all liers impure: In so muche as hee is called Ueritie in the Scripture. And the lying lippes with speakers of vanitie, The Lorde himselfe will reuenge with extremitie. But see, what is hee that aprocheth so nie? New cust. Of whom I tolde you it is Peruerse doctrine verelie. Light of. Then let vs a little steppe out of the waye, If haplie wee may heare what hee will say. Peruersd. A sirrha by my trothe there is a very good vaine: Ignorance hath well lyned his cappe for the rayne. I coulde haue taried longer there with a good wyll, But as the prouerbe saith it is good to keepe still. One head for the reckning bothe sober and wise, Wherefore in this thinge I haue followed that guise. Ignorance is but a dolte, it is I that must drudge, For neede they say maketh the olde wife, and man both to trudge. Suche snares wee shall laye for these Heretikes I trust, That Newcustome, and his fellowes shall soone lye in the dust. If Crueltie may preuaile, hee will neuer slake? Tyll hee haue brought a thousand of them to a stake. Auarice hath promised to do what in him laye, Who hath ben in greate credite with the worlde alway. But if Ignorance may get place, there shall wee do well, Then adewe all idle heretikes, and vaine talke of the gospell. For me Peruersedoctrine this shall be my fetche, To keepe constant the mindes of all I can cetche, Lest these glosers sometimes they chaunce to heare preaching, And thereby be conuerted, and credite their teachinge. For I trust shortly too bring it to passe, That lesse knowledge of the Gospell shall serue by the masse. Light of Let vs inclose him that hee may not flie, Else wyll hee he gone when hee doth vs espie. O impe of Antechrist and seede of the deuyll, Borne to all wickednesse, and nusted in all euyll. Peruersd. Nay thou stinking Heretike art thou there in deede? Accordinge to thy naughtines thou must looke for to speede. New cust. Goddes holie woorde in no wise can be heresie, Though so you terme it neuer so falsly, Peruersd. Yee preciouse whoreson art thou there too? I thinke you haue pretended some harme mee to doo. Helpe, helpe, I say, let mee be gone at once, Else I will smite thee in the face with my fist by goddes bones. New cust. You must be contented a little season to stay, Light of the Gospell for your profite hath some thing to say. Peruersd. I will heare none of your preachinges I promise you playne, For what euer you speake it is but in vayne. Light of. In vayne it shall not be spoken, I know very well. For God hath alwaies geuen suche power to his Gospell, That where euer, or by whom declared it bee, It shall redounde vnto his owne honour, and glorie. God is glorified in those whom hee dooth electe, God is glorified in those also whom hee doth reiecte. The electe are saued by that in the woorde they beeleeue, But the other because no credence they geeue To the truthe, cannot bee but blameable, Committyng a fault of all faultes most damnable. For, Si ad eos non venissem saieth Christ our Sauiour, If I had not come vnto them with the worde, this is sure, In farre better case the vnfaithfull had ben, For in this one respect they had had no sinne. But where the trueth is, and yet there contemned: Of Christ his owne mouth all suche are condempned. Thus the Gospell of Christ be it receiued, or no: Sheweth the glory of God where so euer it go. Peruersd. I were contente to abide, and knowe your pleasure. But for businesse at this time I haue no leysure: Light of the gospel What leisure ought a man at all times more to haue, Then to endeuour bothe his body, and sowle for to saue? New cust. For that care, all other cares wee must set a side. Peruersd. Say on then, for paciently I minde to abide. Light of Not to heare what is spoken is onely sufficient, But to put it in practise with sincere intent What so euer is taught vs concerning good doing, Expressing it plainely in our vertuouse lyuing. Peruersd. Whie? what would you haue mee in liuinge expresse? Light of Euen the Gospell, which is nothing else doubtlesse But amendment of life, and renouncing of sinne: With displeasure toward your selfe for the faultes you were in. Peruersd. How shall I displease my selfe in sinne I would knowe? Light of In considering that nothing bringeth man so lowe Out of Goddes fauour, as sinne, nothing setteth him so hie, As lothing the same: and calling to him for his mercie. Peruersd. Uerely I am sorie for my forepassed demeanour, But that can not auaile mee but little I am sure. Light of Whie thinke you so? boldely tell me your minde? Peruersd. Because Goddes mercie is farre enough behinde. Light of. Goddes mercie is at hande, if you repent faithfully. Peruersd. I repent my sinnes, and for them am sorie hartely. But how shall I be sure mercie for to obtaine? Light of. Credite mee trewly, for my woordes are not vaine. I am Light of the Gospell, and haue full authoritie To pronounce to the penitent forgiuenesse of iniquitie, So that in asking you put your assuraunce to speede, Then no doubt you haue obteyned mercie in deede. Peruerse This assurance, how commeth it? declare I pray you. Light of. In thinking that Christ his woordes, and promises are trewe. And as hee can not deceiue: so can not be disceiued, Which faith of all Christians must nedes be receiued. Peruersd. What thing is Fayth, I pray you recite? Light of. A substance of thinges not appering in sight, Yet which wee looke for, for so saincte Paule doth define, To the Hebreus the .xi chap. and the first line. Peruersd. How to purchase this Faith, I would I could tell? Light of. Certeinly by mee also the light of the Gospell. For fayth commeth by the woorde, when wee reade, or heare. As by the same Sainct Paule it doth plainely eppere. Peruersd. Geue mee leaue then to embrace you I pray you hartely. Light of. With all my very heart I receiue you courtesely. Peruersd. To thee I geue most humble thankes, O God immortall, That it hath pleased thee mee from my wickednesse to call, And where as I deserued no mercie, but iudgement: Yet to powre downe thy pardon on mee most aboundant. Reuoking mee from reprobates, and members of Hell, To win mee in societie with the Light of the Gospell. Light of. Stande vp, there is somewhat else yet behynde. Peruersd. I wholly yelde my selfe to you, vse mee after your minde. Light of. Peruersedoctrine you shall be calde no more after this, But Sincere doctrine, as now I trust your trewe name is. Peruersd. By Goddes grace while I liue I will so endeuour That my life, and my name may accorde thus for euer. Light of. Then all wicked companie you must cleane forsake, And flie their societie, as a tode, or a snake: Peruersd. I abandon them quite, what so euer they bee. New cust. Well Sincere doctrine harken also vnto mee, Whom needes you must followe if you wyll do well, Since you haue imbraced the Light of the Gospell. I am not Newcustome, as you haue ben misled. But am primitiue Constitution, from the verie head Of the Church, which is Christ and his disciples all, And from the fathers at that time taking Originall. By mee then you must learne for your owne beheast, And for all vocations what is iudged the best. Peruersd, I receaue you gladly with thanckes for your ientilnes, At your handes crauing earnestly for my trespas forgyuenes. New cust. It is easly forgeuen, Peruersd. Now as towching my apparell what councell do you giue? For I see well that in the Constitution Primitiue: They vsed no suche garment as I haue on heare, But fashioned it after some other maner. New cust. So did they trewly, I confesse it in deede. But in suche things a man ought not to take so greate heede. For the wearing of a gowne, cap, or any other garment, Surely is a matter, as mee seemeth, indifferent. Howbeit wyse princes, for a difference to be had: Hath commaunded the clargie in suche sorte to be clad. But hee who puttes his religion in wearing the thing: Or thinkes him selfe more holly for the contrarie doing: Shall proue but a foole of what euer condition, Hee bee, for sure that is but meere superstition: Other thinges there be which haue ben abused, Tollerable enough if well they were vsed. Wherefore vse your apparell, as is comely, and decent, And not against Scripture any where in my iudgement. Light of the gospel No sure, for god waieth not, who is a sprite, Of any vesture, or outward apparance a mite. So the conscience be pure, and to no sinne a slaue, That is all which hee most gladly would haue. New cust. Well, these hauing declared, and sufficiently taught: And I trust on your parte perceaued as they ought: By your pacience I minde to departe for a season. Light of If your businesse bee so, it is but reason. New cust. With great thankes vnto you Light of the gospel for the ientelnes I haue found, At your handes, as of due desert I am bound. Light of. The Lorde be your guide whither so euer you departe. Peruersd. Humble thankes sir I yelde you from the bottome of my hearte. Albeit in this parte so small be my skyll, That I may not performe them according to my wyll. New cust. The peace of God be with you both, for euer more. Exit. Edification entreth. Edificati?. Where so euer Light of the Gospell goeth before: There I Edification do followe incontinent, As vnto the same a necessary consequent. For though the letter alwaies, woorke not that effect: Yet surely in the congregation of Goddes elect, Where the light and force taketh place: there Edification Of all right must I make my habitation. Endeuour then alwaies mee to retaine, So shall your doctrine not be gyuen in vayne. Peruersd. I receiue you most gladly, and I trust in the Lorde, That for euer hereafter wee shall well accorde. Felicitie. I trust so. Light of. Fare you well, now you are not alone, For this small while I must needes begone. Here, take at my handes this Testament booke, And in mine absence therein I pray you ernestly looke. Peruerse Your commandement shalbe done, with thankes for your councel. Light of. Then shall yee sure finde great delight in the Gospell. Exit. Assurance entreth. Assur?ce. Edification without assurance vayleth not muche. Yet where they both do meete: surely there Force is suche, That to Goddes kingdome they open the way, The sweete place of rest, and perpetuall ioye. For assurance in Christ Iesus without any mannes further merite: Is fully sufficient goddes fauour to inherite. Wherefore Light of the Gospell willed mee soe, That to you Edification with all speede I should goe. So that with Sincere doctrine wee ioyned in vnitie: Might in short time conduct him to goddes perfect Felicitie. Peruersd. I emprace you Assurance that blisse to obtaine. Assur?ce. Then bee you assured, that you shall not bee vayne. For if that Christes woordes, be faithfull and iust: Goddess perfect Felicitie is not far hence I trust. Goddes Felicitie entreth. Goddes Felicitie. Uerely where Edefication, and Assurance in one are alied: Goddes Felicitie is at hande, it may not be denied. Which hee promiseth to suche as vnfeinedly craue, With Assurance that certainely the same they shall haue Which Felicitie in person heere I do represente, Who by God him selfe to the faythfull am sent, Prepared for them, as hee plainely hath sayde, Since the time that the worldes foundations were laide. Wherefore great thankes vnto hym doutblesse you owe, That it would please him suche giftes on you to bestowe, The most preciouse thing, which mannes reason doth excell, No minde can conceaue, muche lesse tongue can tell. Peruersd. Too him therefore let vs geue all maner prayse, That beareth such affection to mankinde alwaies. O Lorde thine honour might be great in heauen so hie, And throughout the whole earth thie euerlasting glorie. Geeue grace to thy people, that after this transitorie Life, they maye come to thy perfect Felicitie. Edificati? Defende thy Churche, O Christ, and thy holy congregation, Bothe heere in England, and in euery other nation. That wee thy trewth may attaine, and still followe the same, To the saluation of our sowles, and glorie of thy name. Assur?ce. The second songe. Preserue our noble Queene Elizabeth, and her councell all, With thy heauenly grace, sent from thy seate supernall. Graunt her, and them longe to lyue, her to raigne, them to see, What may alwaies be best for the weale publiques commoditie. FINIS.</field>
