      <field name="fulltext">THE BRIDAL EVE. A DRAMATIC SCENE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Lord Fitz-Alwyn. Hubert. Helen. Isabel. Margaret.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, A Lady's Apartment in a Baronial Castle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Helen, Isabel, Margaret. Isabel. This is the bridal eve, and yet thy ladyâ Look how she sits on yonder couch, her head Bent like a snowdrop, her white clasped hands Listlessly hanging on her knee, as though No pulse beat in them. All the livelong day She hath not moved. Why Helen! Helen Clifford! What, not a word to thy poor Isabelâ Thy cousin Isabel? not one kind word When we shall part to-morrow?ânot one word? Can this be the dear maid whom once I knew The merriest heart of merry Cumberland, Carolling her blithe songs from morn to eve As gaily as the gladsome birds that flew Around her summer bower? Margaret. Didst thou ne'er see A caged linnet? Isabel. Oh! how pale she is, How changed, since o'er those northern hills she swept On her white Barbary steed, swift as the wind That waved her glossy tresses, crisp and curled Like the vine's tendrils, o'er that dimpled cheek Of roses, and those eyes of smiling light, And that clear brow! All in her huntress green She might have seemed the youngest fairest nymph Of crescented Diana, such a glow Of beauty was about her. Margaret. Hast thou ne'er Seen a transplanted flowerâseen how it droops And fades and dies? Your southern gardens ill Suit the wild heath-bell. She hath never known Sorrow till now. Now, lady, she hath lost Her home, her father. Isabel. Is not my home hers? And my kind father? Margaret. Ay, but she must leave Even this adopted home, and wedâ Isabel. The pride Of English chivalry! her long betrothedâ And oh, so worthy; bravest in the field, Gayest at revel, kindest every where, Is Lord Fitz-Alwyn. Margaret. Grant that it be so, Unless she loved himâ Isabel. She must love him. Margaret. Look! The very casket, that last night he laid At Helen's feet, still at her feet it lies, Neglected, overthrown. The oaken floor Is bright with jewelry, stringed amethysts, Rubies and sapphires, linked with massy goldâ Helen. Chains! chains! all chains! Isabel. Nay, sweetest coz, see here This diadem of orient pearlâhow well Thy raven curls become it! how it sits Amid the ringlets, with a queenly pride A maiden modesty! Oh fling it not Aside! Helen. Give me the wild wood coronal Of living pearls, fresh from the fragrant thorn And diamonded with dew! Dost thou remember, Margaret, the garland of the Queen of May, When poorâWhat's that? Isabel. 'Tis but the distant sound Of music at the banquet. They feast high. Helen. Hark! hark! This comes not from the hall. 'Tis here Beneath the casement. Margaret, hark! a harp! A northern harp! Margaret. Beshrew these narrow bars! I cannot see the minstrel. Helen. Hush! he sings. Song (without). High o'er the baron's castle tall Rich banners float, with heavy fall, And light and song, in mingling tide, Pour forth to hail the lovely bride. Yet, lady, still the birchen tree Waves o'er the cottage on the lea; The babbling stream runs bright and fair,â The love-star of the west shines there. Isabel. How breathlessly she listens! See, she flings Backward her ringleted and glossy hair, Lest a loose curl might intercept the sound Of that sweet music. Margaret, hast thou heard The strain before? Margaret. The air, but not the words. Song (without). Mail'd warders pace o'er keep and tower, Gay maidens deck the lady's bower; Page, Squire, and knight, a princely train, Wait duteous at her bridle rein. Yet in that cot the milk-white hound, The favourite falcon still are found; And one more fond, more true than they, Born to adore and to obey. Isabel. 'Tis a strange bridal song; but it hath waked The statue into life. Look, how the blood Mounts in her cheek! Margaret. Hush! it begins again. Song (without). The coronet of jewels rare Shines proudly o'er her face so fair; And titles high, and higher name Fitz-Alwyn's lovely bride may claim. And yet the wreath of hawthorn bough Once lightlier press'd that snowy brow; And hearts that wither now were gay When she was but the Queen of May. Isabel. 'Tis over now. That was the final close. Why, Helen, wherefore dost thou wave thy hand From the barr'd casement? Wherefore turn away With thy fine form so raised, so firm a step, So high a brow, and eyes that in their light Bear such command? Helen. Margaret, tell Lord Fitz-Alwyn That I entreat his presence. Margaret. Dearest ladyâ Helen. Question me not, but go. [Exit Margaret. So! will Fitz-Alwyn, Think'st thou, obey the call? Isabel. Doubt not of that. Thou hast been coyer than the fresh-caged bird, To which poor Margaret likened thee; he scarce Hath seen thee, Helenâscarce hath heard thy voice. Re-enter Margaret with Lord Fitz-Alwyn. What, here already? Come upon a wish! Fitz-Alwyn. I was not far to seek. Hast thou ne'er heard How wakeful misers haunt the secret spot Where their heart lies, their gold? Even so lurked I Around my treasure, waiting but to hear A distant footfall, or a clapping door, Or pleasant rustling of a silken robe, Or aught that told of her. What would fair Helen Of her true knight? Isabel. Sit down beside us hereâ She best can speak her will. Helen. I would but ask him To listen to a simple tale of one More simple, a poor northern maid. 'Tis short; 'Twill not detain thee long. Fitz-Alwyn. Oh make it long, That I may listen! Could'st thou know the joy To sit and hear thee! Oh prolong the tale! Speak but till I be weary! Isabel. Now, dear Helen! Helen. There dwelt a knight among the Cumbrian hills With one young daughterâan old wealthy knight, Who had no joy but in the chase, small joy Even in the chase without her. So she grew The hardiest mountain-nymph that ever braved The summer sun, the winter wind. Poor child! She had no mother, none to teach the craft Of female mysteriesâthe lute, the loom, The needleâthem she knew not. All her lore Was of the beauty of the earth and sky, The green hills and the bosky vales, the clear And gushing waters, and the shifting forms Of clouds. All her companions were the dear Mute partners of her sportsâhow speaking they Amidst their speechlessness! Her Barbary steed With his bright arching neck, curved up to meet Her fondling hand; her greyhound, playfullest Of happy creatures, of a richer white, Like marble touched by the sun, leaping and bounding If he but heard her voice; her falcon, proud To sit upon her wrist. She loved them all.â I dally with my tale and weary thee. Fitz-Alwyn. Speak on. Thy voice hath in it such a charm As the clear warblings of the bird of song, The nightingale. Her varied notes we hear All in themselves unlike, yet most unlike All other melody, till every gush Of liquid sound seems to our ravished souls Too brief. Speak on. Isabel. Had she no comrade? Helen. Oneâ Her own dear fatherâandâ Fitz-Alwyn. Speak on. Helen. Hard by Dwelt a lone widow, poor, but gently born, And she too had one child. Fitz-Alwyn. A daughter? Helen. No. He was some two years older than the maid, And loved like her the chase, or rather loved Nature and beautyâthe green wood, the show Of hound and huntsman 'midst the forest glades, The bright and moving picture. For the chase He was too gentle. I have seenâ'twas said He had been seen to weep when the poor stag, Panting and quivering, already dead Almost with fear and toil, hath fallen. Yet still He loved the Barbary steed, the milk-white hound, The bright-eyed falcon. Ever at their side Was Hubert Knowles. Fitz-Alwyn. And the young maid? Loved she One of so soft a mould? Helen. From earliest youth, From earliest childhood, they were playmates, friends. All that she knew of book or song was learnt Of Hubert in that low-roofed cot, where dwelt His smiling mother. There, beneath the shade Of the light fragrant birch and to the sound Of running waters, theyâI speak of them, The mountain maid and the fond motherâoft Would sit for hours, listening his minstrel lay And marking how the poet's fire lit up That mild blue eye, and kindled that pale cheek Embrowned with a sweet sunniness, and raised The veins on his white brow, and seemed to swell His slender form into a nobleness Of beauty; till, at length, with head flung back, And chest dilating, the forgotten harp Dropt silent from his hands, and song was lost In the wild crowd of images that pressed On his awakened fancy. Fitz-Alwyn. Did the maid Wed the young minstrel? Helen. No: she was betrothed. Fitz-Alwyn. Alas! I thought so;âwas betrothed to one Unworthy? Helen. Oh, no, no; to one too good, Too great, too noble! Fitz-Alwyn. One whom she loved not? Helen. One whom she knew not, therefore loved not. Love Is born of love. Fitz-Alwyn. And Hubert? Helen. He spake not; No, not a word! She had broad lands, and he Was poorâ Fitz-Alwyn. Why dost thou pause? Helen. Scarcely she knew, Till they were parted, what her own heart meant When it so throbbed. Fitz-Alwyn. Prythee say on. Helen. Oh, look not So searchingly upon me! Her dear father Died, and her noble wooer from the wars Came crowned with honour; and her guardian sought The lonely orphan in her northern hall, And brought her to his castle. Fitz-Alwyn. Well! Helen. She met Him, her betrothed; and she would fain have toldâ But fear, and awe, and maiden shame, and doubt If Hubert loved, for never tillâ Margaret. Hark! Hark! Again the sweet harp of the north. Song (without). Bless thee! I may no longer stay, No longer bid thee think on me; I cannot 'bide thy bridal dayâ But, Helen, I go blessing thee. Bless thee! no vow of thine is broke; I asked not thy dear love for me, Though tears and sighs and blushes spokeâ Yet, Helen, I go blessing thee. Bless thee! yet do not quite forgetâ Oh, sometimes, sometimes pity me! My sun of life is early setâ But, Helen, I die blessing thee! Helen. Alas! alas! Dost hear him? Fitz-Alwyn. Margaret, seek This harper; bring him hither. We must check His boldness. [Exit Margaret. Tremble not, my loveliest bride, But listen. I have heard thy simple tale Of a fair maiden; now do thou hear mine Of a rough soldier. A young warrior once Rescued an aged knight, brave to a fault, From out the enemy's ranks. Too grateful he For common service; he had one bright gem Fit for an emperor's crown,âbut only one,â Yet that he offered, and the warrior took. Helen. What was the gem? Fitz-Alwyn. A girl! a cherub girl! She was a childâbut such a child!âso full Of life and beauty! sun, and wind, and dew Had formed her like gay flowers, or gayer birds, Or the light brilliant butterfly, that lives In the air. She was all smiles. And he went forth To battle with that vision, as a dream Of gladness round him. Often on the watch Or in the trench before a leaguered town, Or in the pause which weighs upon the soul After the day of battle, would that form, In all its witchery, float around his steps, Around his heart. Years passed, and as he saw The laughing girls of France, he'd pause and say, So tall must she be now.âThis tale of mine Troubles thee, sweet one. Helen. Oh, go on, my lord! Prythee go on! How little she deserved, How little deemedâGo on. Fitz-Alwyn. At length came peace, And our rude warrior turned him to his home And his betrothed bride. His first kind friend, The good old knight, was dead; but he found friends In all around her. She aloneâhow fair How beautiful she was! her charms outran Memory and fancy;âbut so pale, so sad, With head averted and with downcast eyes And shivering hands that shrank from his, and speech Short and unfrequent, and more chilling cold Than silenceâHelen, from the hour we met, Thy thoughts have injured me. I was thy friend, Why treat me as thy tyrant? Why delay The story of thy love? Why tremble thus? Why hide thy beauteous face? Helen. Oh, spare me now, Fitz-Alwyn! Spare me! I have told thee all. Fitz-Alwyn. Ay; but too late. The bridal hour is fixed; The guests are bidden; the huge tables groan Already with the banquet; harp and song Already fill the halls; already flowers Bestrew the path where thou and thy fair maids Shall tread; already those fair maids have donned Their smiles and blushes. Lady Isabel, Say, is it not too late? Must she not wed To-morrow? Helen. Oh, no! no! In mercy no! Re-enter Margaret with Hubert. Fitz-Alwyn. This is thy bridal eve. Approach, young Sir! Helenâmy Helenâfor the first, last time, I dare to call thee so.âLook up, dear maid! Thou hast done rightly, wisely, kindly, Helen, By me, by all. Nay, draw not back thy hand; I will but seal it with one parting kiss.â Now take it, Hubert Knowles! thou hast her heart; They shall not be divided. She is thine.</field>
