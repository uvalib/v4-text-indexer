      <field name="fulltext">DARAXES, A PASTORAL OPERA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Plan, for the First Act of Daraxes. AN Opera: of two Acts only. Arpasia, a beautiful shepherdess, is discover'd, reading, in the entrance of an arbour at the foot of a mountain, the scene, all round her, representing vallies, and openings, between ridges of rocks; with prospects of sheep, at pasture; and shepherds, reclin'd, at a distance. During a song, that expresses sentiments, prefering the serene life, to the busy—she is approached, from one of the remotest openings, behind the hills, by Zamora, another noble shepherdess. They meet, and salute, with tenderness, innocence, and mutual declaration of their happiness: and, it appears, from their dialogue, that Zamora, (tho' not insensible of the charms of her retir'd life) has wishes for an enlargement, into the greater world; while Arpasia, on the contrary, enjoys the whole of her desire, in possession of her present happiness. Hydarnes, father of Zamora, in the venerable habit of one of the Persian Magi, enters to them, thro' the arbour; and, having overheard the dispute, declares in favour of Arpasia; and warns Zamora of the dangers of the busier world; representing, in contraste, the calmness and delights of their retreat, in a lovely and fruitful tract, on the river Indus, unknown to, and cut off from, the rest of Persia, by inaccessible ranges of mountains, where he governs, independently, a peaceful, and happy, number of families, whom, from ignorance and rudeness, he had soften'd into knowledge and politeness. In the midst of this conference, they are interrupted by the sound of a trumpet; at which they express amazement: the peace, and silence of their happy region having never been invaded by so warlike an alarm.—On a sudden, down from the hills, and from the windings behind them, rush in a number of shepherds; under impressions of terror, to behold, descending from the top of a rock, on one side the stage, Daraxes, an Indian General, plum'd, in a warlike, and heroic habit. The shepherds interpose between the stranger and Hydarnes; but, Daraxes, surprized at appearance of the Ladies, first addresses himself to them with a modest gallantry; and, then, approaching Hydarnes, with a resigned and humble gesture, implores his pity, and the protection, due, to unfortunate virtue. Hydarnes, mentioning the trumpet, is answered, by Daraxes, that he brought it not with him, but is flying from its menaces—that he is Lord of a province on the other side of the Indus; and, having received great wrongs, from Persia, had gather'd a number of his friends, and invaded the kingdom, for revenge of his injuries—that he had been victorious in two pitch'd battles; but, unfortunately overpowered, by superior numbers, in a third, was seeking shelter, among those desart mountains; and now closely pursued, after loss of all his followers, by Hystaspes, the Persian Monarch, at the head of his light-arm'd; therefore, begs the furtherance of Hydarnes, for his escape, if it is possible;—if not, at least for his concealment, against a day of happier fortune. Hydarnes bids him be of comfort—since he was, himself, of Indian blood, and cou'd protect him, in the inmost parts of his region, by advantage of a neighbouring pass, which he points to, against the utmost force of Persia.—He then sends out a party of shepherds up the hills on the left, to observe, and bring him word, how near, and how numerous the pursuers;—and, leaving a second party, to attend Daraxes, and the Ladies, promises to return, after having given orders for arming his people, and the necessary defence of the pass. He then goes out, up the hills, on the right, attended by a third division of shepherds. Daraxes, with the Ladies, mistaking them for sisters, Zamora tells him they are friends, if possible, nearer than sisters: and expressing apprehension, presses Arpasia, to retire; who, appearing now more spirited, and affirming that she fears no danger, Zamora smiles, to perceive how willingly she wou'd forgive her being left alone, with the agreeable stranger; and goes out, up the hill, after her father. Then comes on an amorous, and gallant scene, between Daraxes and Arpasia: which closes the first Act of the Opera. Plan, for the Second Act. To the sound of trumpets, and drums, Hystaspes, and his soldiers, appear, among the hills, descending into the valley, on the left side:—And, on the opposite side, to sound of flutes, and soft instruments, interchangeably heard from each quarter, descends Hydarnes, surrounded by a venerable number of Magi, with the holy fire; followed by Daraxes, between Arpasia and Zamora; and, supported by armed shepherds, with bows and quivers; great numbers of spears appearing, above, as it were, among, and behind, the hills.—The Persian soldiers range themselves, as fast as they descend, on one side the stage; and the armed shepherds do the like, on the other. After a solemn pause, and slow advance, to give time for the contraste in the music, Hystaspes commands his followers to reverence the holy fire, and commit no outrage against, or in presence of the Magi.—He then approaches Hydarnes, and demands sternly who and whence he is; and of what branch of the Magi. —Hydarnes answers, that he was, not originally, but, adoptedly, of the Magi,—once, a slave, to the uncle of that Lady, pointing to Arpasia; who was a branch of their Royal, and most illustrious, stem.—But, that, as to himself, having by his skill, in music, arms, and arts, polish'd, and improv'd, the manners of the rural inhabitants of that savage tract, he had grown so far into the esteem of their true and original Lord, that he had bequeathed to him his power, and adopted him his successor. —That he has, since then, so far improv'd the happiness of his impenetrable region, that it has, now, neither the want, the fear, nor desire, of the wealth, or the strength of Persia. The King then reproaches Hydarnes with the abuse of his religious indemnity, by protection of an enemy in arms; an invader of Persia: and, upon rejection of his demand that Daraxes should be given up, grows furious, with resentment, and is advancing to attack the shepherds; who, on their side, advance also; but, the Ladies coming forward, and asserting the rights of their sanctuary, the King seems struck with the beauty of Zamora, and agrees, at her desire, to refer the justice of his claim to the decision of herself, and Hydarnes.—And, upon her proposition, Daraxes, too, on his part, consents to submit himself, without complaint, to her judgment. Hydarnes desires the King to explain the foundation of his anger; gently reproaching too eager a thirst of revenge.—The King informs him, that this Daraxes, the Indian, had, unprovok'd, invaded his dominion, destroy'd his towns, and his people, and being, now, after two successful battles, deliver'd into his hands, by favour of the Gods, upon loss of a third, it would be impious in the Magi to withstand the pleasure of Heaven. He therefore insists, that they give up Daraxes as a public enemy to Persia—a fugitive, forsaken by Gods, and men, and deserving the punishments, which were prepared for his violence. Daraxes, coming to plead, in his turn, denies that he had, unprovok'd, invaded Persia.—Asserting, on the contrary, that Darius, the father of Hystaspes, had fallen into India, with fire and sword; at which time he, Daraxes, had narrowly escap'd death, in his tenderest infancy, after having seen his mother, and brothers, barbarously destroy'd, in the flames of their city; and his father, and a little sister, forc'd away into captivity;—that his hopes of a glorious revenge was his warmest motive, and the justest for supporting a life, which had, so early, been imbitter'd with misery;—that he had, to that end, made arms his study, and that, however the Gods (for some causes unknown) had now seem'd to frown on his purpose, they would restore him sure means, hereafter— for, they forsake not virtue, for ever. Hydarnes, in the close of what Daraxes had utter'd, keeping his eye fix'd on his face, interrupts him, with marks of confusion, enquiring, first, his own name, then that of his city—next, with increasing passion and amazement, his mother's name—lastly, that of his lost father, and his sister; and, receiving answers to his expectation, throws himself, with extasy, upon the neck of Daraxes; telling him, that he is, himself, that lost father— and, giving Zamora into his arms, bids him embrace his captive sister. After the surprize, natural to the occasion, Hystaspes, in reverence of a virtue so great, and so visibly protected by the Gods; and, also, in atonement, for the wrongs which had been done, by his father, proposes to make Zamora his Queen; which being consented to, by Hydarnes, Daraxes then begs, that he may be bless'd with Arpasia, and quit an unsteady world, for that happiest of lives, which had, so long, been enjoy'd by his father. —The Opera, here closes, with a dance of the Shepherds, six and six, for entertainment of the King, and in honour of the intended nuptials.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. An arbour, at the foot of a mountain: the scene representing vallies, and openings between ridges of rocks.—Sheep, at pasture, in prospect; and shepherds, reclin'd at a distance —Arpasia, reading, at the entrance of the arbour. Soft, distant, music, for some time, as of the shepherds pipes, from the mountains. Arp. While, around, in soft caresses, Nature blesses; While she the plains, with peace, and plenty, dresses: Art informs a reader's mind, To taste, with pleasure, All this treasure; Feeling ev'ry joy, design'd.— But, you, my harmless sheep, in pasture, bleating! Tho' far more innocent, than we; Wanting reason, want compleating; Nor your own enjoyments see.— And, yet—perhaps, where thought's a stranger, Pleasure enjoys a sweeter taste! Man,—who by knowledge, knows his danger: Fearing the future, while he weighs the past; Lets all his present blessing ebb, too fast: And glide unheeded, lest they should not last. Enter, to her, Zamora, like an Amazon; with a bow and quiver, from a remote opening, behind the rocks. Zam. Arpasia! dear lov'd sister of my soul! While thou sitt'st, reading, My steps, which ne'er could brook my thought's controul, Gay, and unheeding, Have trod the morning dews, in distant vales: O'er hills, high-pacing, The wild deer chasing, Light and unbounded, as the mountain gales.— Why art thou pensive?— Warm, and extensive, My mounting soul, from every pore exhales.— If there's a world, beyond this rocky bound, Why are we, here, confin'd, to dwell unknown? Jewels, conceal'd, can bear no price, till found, And, what are conscious charms, if never shown? Duet. Arp. Thou, beautiful wanton, be wary. Zam. And thou, my dear wise-one, take heed. Arp. Who wish for too much will miscarry. Zam. But—I wish for no more than I need. Arp. At home, we live happy, and quiet. Zam. Abroad, we are courted, and gay. Arp. There's surfeit, in richness of diet. Zam. Ay—but fasting will wear us away. Enter Hydarnes, from the arbour. Zam. Peace, peace, Arpasia:—see!—my father's here: Freedom's too bold, that toys when wisdom's near. Hyd. Zamora, I have heard;—and smil'd:— Believe Arpasia—she, tho' young, is wise— Thou art, by passion's heedless warmth, beguil'd;— Light, and unskill'd the bliss of life to prize, Thy tottering reason, like a tripping child, Falls, at each straw, that, in thy passage, lies. Falsely, alas! thy wishes paint: Miscalling innocence restraint. Ah! bar no mortal bliss, beyond redress! The happy know not happiness.— Safe, and unliable to wrongs, or snares, No pains of life can overtake thee, here: Why art thou longing, then, for absent cares? And wishing torments near? Arp. Light, but not vain—as when the sun-beams play, And, o'er each object, dart the wav'ring ray; The bright delusion glows, yet holds no fire, So, flames Zamora's wish, without desire. Air. Zam. [Laughingly.] Never never trust—a virgin's tongue, 'Twill ne'er her heart betray. Ever while you live, fair maids among, Heed what they do (if you please) you may, But—give to the winds whate'er they say. Arp. Her honest heart, unconscious of designs, Knowing no ill, no cover needs: Gay, as her eyes, her artless freedom shines; Nor feels she half the warmth for which she pleads. Zam. I'll sing an idle song, I taught the swains, To justify my gayety. Air. Zam. The maid that stands mute, like a spy, And leers, with a downcast eye, Looks in, upon warm desire: They'll find it who venture to try her. But, she whose light joke at random flies, Throws outward all her fire. Arp. Ah!—yet—the happy medium's best: For they who bless others, deserve to be blest. Zam. Give me a mistress (if such to be had) Gravely glad; Nor mop'd, nor mad: Neither too silly, nor wisely imperious;— Softly gay, and, sweetly, serious. Both. —Ah!—such a happy medium's best! Hyd. Peace to the chearful heart!—I like it well, Where wit and judgment, both, together live: But, when warm wishes with gay fancy dwell, Alarm'd discernment must not, there, forgive. I tell thee, levity can never dream, What waiting woes empale the busy great. The world's proud idols are not what they seem; But, slaves, to empty form, and tools of state. Malice, revenge, fear, avarice, and smart, Ride, in their pomp, and hover o'er their beds: Sleep has no rest—their very love is art! Pain, in their hearts! and tinsel on their heads! One glowing lustre of embroider'd pride Mis-colours public life, with vain pretence: But, cannot, from experienc'd reason, hide, How far less bless'd, than humble innocence. Here, in this lovely tract, which nature, round, With peace, and safety, wall'd—remote from pow'r, In plains, by bars of rocky mountains, bound, Sweetly content, enjoy the smiling hour. Arp. Else, were our wisdom, great Hydarnes! less, Than theirs, your humblest swains, whose minds new dress, Polish'd from rudeness, does their teacher bless, While, in their native wilderness, A spring, of arts, and arms, the shepherds feel; And each new day does some new bliss reveal. Zam. One wish, still wanting, to my aid I call; Till others know me bless'd, scarce bless'd, at all. Hid from mankind, our joys in darkness lie, My father's virtues, like our God, the sun, O'er an enlighten'd world were form'd to fly, Not a short course, 'twixt desart mountains, run. Hyd. How vain alas! our erring wishes are! Treading on peace, we reach at care! Shew me the man, who knows not where to see One, more belov'd, and less oblig'd, than he; Who feels no pain, suspects no foe, On his own land whose riches grow; Whose thoughts, are, like his actions, free, Who neither envies, frets, nor fears: Whom learning softens, honour steers: Whom love attends, and truth endears: Immortal Powers!—how mad this man must be, Cou'd he, in courts, expect to see, A Lord, so nobly great, as he! [Sound of a trumpet, at distance. [They start,—and appear surpriz'd. Zam. [Joyfully.] Ah!—what inspiring call invites my ear! Arp. [Terrified.] Grant, Heaven! no unexpected danger near! Hyd. The brave, and the prepar'd, admit no fear. Yet, till this moment, breath'd no trumpet, here, To break soft quiet, in these happy shades, By notes, alarming, warlike, and severe! [Trumpet again. Hark! it each cavern of our hills invades. Enter from the openings, between the rocks, on the right, a great number of shepherds, in different parties, with signs of surprize, and apprehension. Hyd. See!—down the winding of yon hill, descends A warrior, plum'd, and arm'd! of princely air! He comes, in haste, alone—and this way bends. Enter from a rock, on the left, Daraxes—The shepherds interpose between the stranger and Hydarnes. Zam. Stand—or, advancing, to thy ruin, dare. [Advancing, with her bow; and an arrow presented. Hyd. Brave! and, beyond her sex, aspiring still!— Hold, my Zamora—shepherds, give me way. Dar. [To Zamora.] Goddess of arms! whose eyes have power to kill! My spear, defenceless, at your feet I lay: Unhappy, as its dying bearer's fate, If it alarm'd your will, to bar my way! [Dar. laying down his sword also. Air. Take, O take, my useless arms, All defence I now forswear. Proof, against such pointed charms, None the God of war cou'd wear! If, in fight, to be a loser, Brings the vanquish'd smiles like these, Fame, henceforth, will tempt no chuser, Love will teach disgrace to please. Hyd. Whence, stranger, has your trumpet passage found, To fright the silent Genius of our groves? Dar. Pursu'd, alas! I fly the hostile sound; That, not my fear, but apprehension, moves. Lord of a province, never Persia's claim, (Our rapid Indus rolls his waves between:) For wish'd revenge of wrongs, in arms, I came, Mov'd by no pride of pow'r, or hateful spleen. Two happy battles gave my sword success; A third involv'd my fortune in distress. My followers lost, I fled a light-arm'd throng Of Persians, whom their Monarch wings along. Hystaspes! (not more brave) more bless'd, than I, Now, triumphs—and, 'tis mine, to 'scape, or die. Hid, in these hills' impervious shades, my life, Imploring pity, you have pow'r to save. Zam. Hope—for my father is no friend to strife; But loves the wretched, and protects the brave. Arp. Hydarnes cannot wrong the faith you bring; More than Hystaspes here—tho' not a King. Hyd. If the revenge which thou hast lost, was just, The Gods can give it back—Be bold, and trust. Led, by some hand divine, thou found'st the way; Where never wand'ring foot, before, cou'd stray. Myself, of Indian blood, be safe, with me: Behind these Pointing to the right. hills, a region I command, Guarded, by passes, from invasion free, And proof, against whole Persia's warlike hand. Some To a party of shepherds who go out, up the hills on the left. to those hills, down which the stranger came, Climb; and inform me, when the danger's near. Stay, you To a second party of shepherds, who, remain, as guards, to the Ladies.,—Arpasia, and my daughter, claim Your presence—Stay, and wait their orders, here. Expect me swiftly back—I go but hence To arm, and animate our due defence Goes out, attended by a third party of shepherds, up the hills on the right.. Air. Dar. Aid me, reason! aid me, art! In war, pursued, in love pursuing? What a folly guides my heart! Can desire arise from ruin? Can I feel a lover's smart? Teach, lovely sisters! teach my willing tongue, By what sweet name your virtues shou'd be sung? Zam. Sisters, by choice we are, but not by name: Friendship, that nobler tye, Joins our two kindred souls, in one soft flame; Lights up affection, both in heart, and eye: And bids it never die. Come, my Arpasia, to the pass—'tis near: Danger, perhaps, may overtake us, here. Arp. Methinks, we have not yet, such cause for fear, Danger, so distant, and our friends so nigh. Air. Zam. When a maid, who was fearful, alone, Grows bold, if her hero is by; Other maids are politely shown, That she wants not their company: Good b'wye, my dear sister, good b'wye, You want not my company, [Exit Zamora, laughing. Arp. Stranger—permit me to conduct you, on: Zamora's livelier steps have led the way. Dar. I grieve the Lady's haste, untimely gone: But cou'd, myself, methinks, for ever—stay. Arp. Why wou'd you stay?—The foe may soon, descend. Dar. All foes are lost, in so divine a friend. Wou'd I had never seen you! for,(before) I hop'd—but, now,—can ne'er be happy more. Arp. Whence this unjust despair? Dar. From love, and you:— A stranger, whom unhappy stars pursue, Dares not aspire— Arp. The brave for ever, dare; Virtue shou'd suffer all things—but despair. Unhappy merit claims deserv'd redress. Dar. The woes you pity, cease to be distress. Un-envy'd, let Hystaspes, now, pursue: 'Tis more than conquest, to be sav'd by you. Duet. Dar. Wou'd my gentle charmer hear me, I cou'd talk my life away: Arp. Did my modest heart but clear me, I wou'd ask—What is't you'd say! Dar. Think, how sweetly form'd you are. Arp. That's a thought, below my care. Dar. Think, I adore— Arp. I'll hear no more— Dar. One moment stay— Arp. I must away— Dar. I have a thousand things to say. Arp. Come, and, within, repeat 'em o'er.
