      <field name="fulltext">THE SEA VOYAGE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus ScÃ¦na Prima. A Tempest, Thunder and Lightning. Enter Master and two Saylors. Master. Lay her aloofe, the Sea grows dangerous, How it spits against the clouds, how it capers, And how the fiery Element frights it back! There be devils dancing in the aire, I think I saw a Dolphin hang ith hornes of the moone Shot from a wave: hey day, hey day, How she kicks and yerks? Down with'e main Mast, lay her at hull, Farle up all her Linnens, and let her ride it out. 1 Saylor. Sheele never brook it Master. Shees so deep laden, that sheele buldge; Master. Hang her. Can she not buffet with a storm a little? How it tosses her! she reeles like a Drunkard. 2 Saylor. We have discovered the Land Sir, Pray lets make in, shee's so drunke; else, She may chance to cast up all her Lading. 1 Saylor. Sland in, sland in, we are all lost els, lost and perisht. Master. Steer her a Star-boord there. 2 Saylor. Beare in with all the Sayle we can, see Master See, What a clap of Thunder there is, What a face of heaven, how dredfully it looks? Master. Thou rascall, thou fearfull rogue, thou hast bin praying; I seet in thy face, thou hast been mumbling, When we are split you slave; is this a time, To discourage our friends with your cold orrizons? Call up the Boatswaine; how it storms; holla. Boatswain. What shall we doe Master? Cast over all her lading? she will not swimme An houre else; Enter Albert Franvile La-mure Tibalt de pont. Morillat. Mast. The storm is lowd, We cannot heare one another, What's the coast? Boatsw. We know not yet; shall we make in? Albert. What comfort Saylers? I never saw, since I have known the Sea, (Which has been this twenty yeers) so rude a tempest. In what State are we? Master. Dangerous enough Captain, We have sprung five leakes, and no little ones; Still rage; besides her ribs are open; Her rudder almost spent; prepare your selves; And have good courages, death comes but once, And let him come in all his frights. Albert. Is't not possible, To make in toth' Land? 'tis here before us. Morill. Here hard by Sir. Master. Death is neerer Gentlemen. Yet doe not cry, lets dye like men. Talbat. Shal's hoyse the Boat out, Enter Amint. And goe all at one cast? the more the merrier. Master. You are too hasty Mounsieur, Do ye long to be ith Fish-market before your time? Hold her up there. Amint. O miserable Fortune, Nothing but horrour sounding in mine eares, No minute to promise to my frighted soule. Tibat. Peace woman, We ha storms enough already; no more howling. Amint. Gentle Master. Mast. Clap this woman under hatches. Alb. Prethee speake mildly to her. Amint. Can no help? Mast. None that I know. Amint. No promise from your goodnesse? Mast. Am I a God? for heavens sake stoaw this woman. Tilb. Goe: take your gilt Prayer Booke; And to your businesse; winck and die, There an old Haddock stayes for ye. Amint. Must I dye here in all the frights, the terrors, The thousand severall shapes, death triumphes in? No friend to councell me? Alb. Have Peace sweet Mistresse. Amint. No kindreds teares upon me? Oh! my country! No gentle hand to close mine eyes? Alb. Be comforted, heaven has the same Power still, and the same mercy. Amint. Oh! that wave will devour me! Mast. Carry her down Captaine; Or by these hands, I'le give no more direction, Let the Ship sinck or swimme; we ha nere better luck, When we ha such stoage as these trinkets with us, These sweet sin-breeders; how can heaven smile on us, When such a burthen of iniquity Lies tumbling like a potion in our Ships belly? Exit. Tib. A way with her, and if she have a Prayer; That's fit for such an houre, let her say't quickly, And seriously. Exit. Alb. Come, I see it cleer Lady, come in, And take some comfort. I'le stay with ye. Amint. Where should I stay? to what end should I hope, Am I not circled round with misery? Confusions in their full heights dwell about me; O Mounsier Albert, How am I bound to curse ye, If curses could redeeme me? how to hate ye? You forc't me from my quiet, from my friends; Even from their Armes, that were as deere to me, As day light is, or comfort to the wretched; You forc't my friends from their peacefull rest, Some your relentles sword gave their last groanes; Would I had there been numbred; And to fortunes never satisfied afflictions, Ye turn'd my Brother; and those few friends I'd left Like desperate creatures, to their own feares And the worlds stubborn pitties: Oh merciles. Alb. Sweet Mistresse. Amint. And whether they are wandred to avoyd ye, Or whether dead and no kind earth to cover 'em; Was this a lovers part? but heaven has found ye, And in his lowd voyce, his voyce of thunder, And in the mutiny of his deep wonders, He tels ye now, ye weepe too late: Alb. Let these tears tell how I honour ye; Ye know deer Lady, since ye were mine, How truly I have lov'd ye, how sanctimoniously Observ'd your honour; not one lascivious word, Not one touch Lady; no, not a hope that might not render me The unpolluted servant of your Chastity; For you I put to Sea, to seek your Brother; Your Captain, yet your slave, that his redemption, If he be living, where the Sunne has circuit, May expiate your rigor, and my rashnesse. Amint. The Storm grows greater; what shall we do? Alb. Let's in; And aske heavens mercy; my strong mind yet presages, Through all these dangers, we shall see a day yet (Exit. Shall Crown your pious hopes, and my faire wishes. Enter Master, Saylors, Gentlemen, Boatswayne and Surgeon. Mast. It must all over boord. Boatsw. It cleers to Sea-ward mast. Fling o're the lading there, and let's lighten her; All the meat, and the Cakes, we are all gone else; That we may finde her Leakes, and hold her up; Yet save some little Bisket for the Lady, Till we come to the Land. La-m. Must my goods over too? Why honest Master? here lies all my money; The money I ha wrackt by usurie, To buy new Lands and Lordships in new Countryes, 'Cause I was banisht from mine own I ha been this tweenty yeers a raising it. Tilb. Out with it: The devils are got together by the eares, who shall have it; And here they quarrell in the clouds. La-m. I am undone Sir: Tib. And be undone, 'tis better then we perish. La-m. O save one Chest of Plate. Tib. A way with it, lustily Saylors; It was some pawne, that he has got unjustly; Down with it low enough, and let Crabs breed in't; Mast. Over with the Truncks too. Enter Albert. Alb. Take mine and spare not; Mast. We must over with all. Fran. Will ye throw away my Lordship That I sold, put it into clothes and necessaries, To goe to Sea with? Tib. Over with it; I love to see a Lordship sincke; Sir you left no Wood upon't to bovy it up; You might ha sav'd it else. Fran. I am undone for ever; Alb. Why we are all undone; would you be only happy? La-m. Sir you may loose too. Tib. Thou liest; I ha nothing but my skinne, And my Clothes; my sword here, and my self; Two Crowns in my Pocket; two paire of Cards; And three false Dice: I can swime like a Fish; Rascall, nothing to hinder me. Boatsw. In with her of all hands. Mast. Come gentlemen, come Captain, ye must helpe all; My life now for the Land, 'Tis high, and rocky, and full of perils; Alb. How ever let's attempt it. Mast. Then cheer lustily my hearts. Exit. Enter Sebastian and Nicusa. Sebast. Yes 'tis a Ship, I see it now, a tal Ship; She has wrought lustily for her deliverance; Heavens mercy, what a wretched day has here been? Nicu. To still and quiet minds, that knew no misery, It may seeme wretched, but with us 'tis ordinary; Heaven has no Storm in store, nor earth no terror, That can seeme new to us. Sebast. 'Tis true Nicusa; if fortune were determin'd To be wanton, and would wipe out the stories Of mens miseries: yet we two living, We could crosse her purpose; for 'tis impossible She should cure us, we are so excellent in our afflictions; It would be more then glory to her blindnes, And stile her power beyond her pride, to quit us. Nicusa. Doe they live still? Sebast. Yes, and make to harbour: Nicu. Most miserable men; I greive their Fortunes. Sebast. How happy had they been, had the Sea cover'd 'em? They leap from one calamity to another; Had they been drown'd, they had ended all their sorrows. What showts of joy they make? Nicu. Alas poor wretches, had they but once experience Of this Island, they'd turn their tunes to waylings; Sebast. Nay, to curses. That ever they set foot on such calamities; Here's nothing but rocks and barrennes, Hunger, and cold to eat; here's no Vineyards To cheere the heart of man, no Christall Rivers After his labour to refresh his body, If he be feeble; nothing to restore him, But heavenly hopes; nature that made those remedies, Dares not come here, nor looke on our distresses, For fear she turn wilde like the place and barren. Nicu. O Uncle, yet a little memory of what we were, 'Twill be a little comfort in our calamities; When we were seated in our blessed homes, How happy in our kindreds, in our families, In all our Fortunes? Sebast. Curse on those French Pirates, that displanted us; That flung us from that happinesse we found there; Constrain'd us to Sea, to save our lives, honours and our riches, Withall we had, our kinsmen and our jewels, In hope to finde some place free from such robbers, Where a mighty storme severd our Barkes, That, where my wife, my daughter And my noble Ladyes that went with her, Virgins and loving soules, to scape those Pirates. Nicus. They are living yet; such goodnesse cannot perish. Sebast. But never to me Cozen; Never to me againe; what beares their Flag-staves? Nicu. The Armes of France sure; Nay, doe not start, we cannot be more miserable; Death is a cordial, now, come when it will. Sebast. They get to shore a pace, they'le flye as fast When once they find the place; what's that which swims there? Ni. A strong young man Sir, with a handsome woman. Hanging about his Neck. Sebast. That shewes some honour; May thy brave charity what ere thou art, Be spoken in a place, that may renown thee, And not dye here. Nicasa. The Boat it seemes turn'd over, So forced to their shifts, yet all are landed, They're Pirats on my life. Sebast. They will not rob us; For none will take our misery for riches: Come Cozen, let's descend and try their pitties; If we get off, a little hope walkes with us; If not, we shall but load this wretched Island With the same shadows still that must grow shorter. Ex. Enter Albert, Aminta, Tibalt, Morillat La-mure, Master, Franvile, Surgeon, Saylors. Tibal. Wet come a shore my mates, we are safe arrived yet. Mast. Thanks to heavens goodnesse, no man lost; The Ship rides faire to, and her leakes in good plight. Albert. The weathers turn'd more courteous; How does my deere? Alas, how weake she is and wet? Amint. I am glad yet, I scapt with life; Which certain Noble Captain, next to heavens goodnesse, I must thanke you for, and which is more, Acknowledge your deer tendernesse, your firme love To your unworthy Mistresse, and recant to (Indeed I must) those harsh opinions, Those cruell unkind thoughts, I heapt upon ye; Farther then that, I must forget your Injuries. So farre I am tyde, and fetred to your service, Beleeve me I will learne to love. Albert. I thank ye Madam, And it shall be my practise to serve. What cheere companions? Tibalt. No great cheere Sir, a peece of souced Bisket And halfe a hard egge, for the Sea has taken order; Being young and strong, we shall not surfet Captaine. For mine own part, Ile Dance till I'm dry; Come Surgeon, out with your Glister-pipe, And stricke a Galliard. Alb. What a brave day again; And what faire weather, after so fowle a storme? La-mure. I ant pleas'ed the Master, he might ha seen This weather, and ha sav'd our goods. Alb. Never think on em, we have our lives and healths. La-m. I must think on em, and think 'Twas most maliciously done to undoe me. Fran. And me to, I lost all; I hant another shirt to put upon me, nor Clothes But these poor raggs; I had fifteen faire sutes, The worst was cut upon Taffaty. Tib. I am glad you ha lost, give me thy hand, Is thy skin whole? art thou not purl'd with scabbs? No Ancient monuments of madam Venus? Thou hast a suit then will pose the cunningst Taylor, That will never turn fashion, nor forsake thee, Till thy executors the wormes uncase thee, They take off glorious sutes Franvile: thou art happy, Thou art delivered of em; here are no Brokers; No Alchymists to turn 'em into Mettle; Nor Leather'd Captaine's with Ladies to adore 'em; Wilt thou see a dogfish rise in one of thy brave doublets, And tumble like a Tub to make thee merry, Or an old Haddock rise with thy hatcht sword Thou payd'st a hundred Crowns for? A Mermayd in a mantle of your worships, Or a Dolphin in your double ruffe? Fran. Ye are merry, but if I take it thus, If I be foysted and jeer'd out of my goods. La-mure. Nor I, I vow thee. Nor Master nor mate, I see your cunning, Alb. O be not angry Gentlemen. Moril. Yes Sir we have reason. And some friends I can make. Mast. What I did Gentlemen, was for the generall safety. If ye ayme at me, I am not so tame. Tib. Pray take my councell Gallants. Fight not till the Surgeon be well, Hee's damnable Sea-sick, and may spoyle all; Besides he has lost his Fidlestick, and the best Box of Bores grease; why doe you make such faces, And hand your swords? Alb. Who would ye fight with? Gentlemen? Who has done ye wrong? for shame be better temper'd. No sooner come to give thankes for our safeties, But we must raise new civill Broyles amongst us Inflame those angry powers, to shower new vengeance on us? What can we expect for these unmanly murmers, These strong temptations of their holy pitties, But plagues in another kind, a fuller, so dreadfull, That the singing stormes are slumbers to it? Tib. Be men and rule your minds; If you will needs fight Gentlemen, And thinke to raise new riches by your valours, Have at ye, I have little else to doe now I have said my Prayers; you say you have lost, And make your losse your quarrell, And grumble at my Captaine here, and the Master, Two worthy persons; indeed too worthy for such rascals, Thou Galloone gallant, and Mamon you That build on golden mountaines, thou money Maggot; Come all draw your swords, ye say ye are miserable. Alb. Nay, hold good Tibalt. Tib. Captaine, let me correct em; I'le make ye ten times worse, I will not leave em; For look ye, fighting is as nourishing to me as eating, I was born quarrelling. Mast. Pray Sir. Tib. I will not leave em skins to cover em; Doe ye grumble; when ye are well ye rogues? Mast. Noble Du-pont. Tib. Ye have Clothes now: and ye prate. Amin. Pray Gentlemen, for my sake be at peace. La-m. Let it become me to make all friends. Fran. You have stopt our angers Lady. Alb. This shewes noble. Tib. 'Tis well: 'tis very well: there's halfe a Bisket, Break't amongst ye all, and thank my bounty, This is clothes &amp; Plate too; come no more quarrelling. Amin. But ha! what things are these, Enter Sebastian and Nicusa. Are they humane creatures? Tib. I have heard of Sea-Calves. Alb. They are no shaddows sure, they have Leggs and Armes. Tilb. They hang but lightly on though. Amint. How they looke, are they mens faces? Tib. They have Horse-Tayles growing to em, Goodly long maines. Amint. Alas what sunk eyes they have! How they are crept in, as if they had been frighted! Sure they are wretched men. Tib. Where are their Wardrobs? Looke ye Franvile, here are a cople of Courtiers. Amint. They kneele, alas poore soules. Alb. What are ye? speake; are ye alive, Or wandring shaddows, that finde no peace on earth, Till ye reveale some hidden secret? Sebast. We are men as you are; Onely our miseries make us seem Monsters. If ever pitty dwelt in noble hearts; Alb. We understand 'em too: pray marke em Gentlemen; Sebast, Or that heaven is plea'sd with human charity; If ever ye have heard the name of friendship? Or suffered in your selves, the least afflictions, Have gentle Fathers that have bred ye tenderly, And Mothers that have wept for your misfortunes, Have mercy on our miseries. Alb. Stand up wretches; Speak boldly, and have release; Nicus. If ye be Christians, And by that blesse'd name, bound to releeve us, Convey us from this Island. Alb. Speake; what are ye? Seb. As you are, Gentle born; to tell ye more, Were but to number up our own calamities, And turn your eyes wild with perpetuall weepings; These many yeers, in this most wretched Island We two have liv'd: the scorne and game of fortune; Blesse your selves from it Noble Gentlemen; The greatest plagues, that humane nature suffers, Are seated here, wildnesse, and wants innumerable. Alb. How came ye hither? Nicus. In a ship, as you do, and as you might have been. Had not heaven preserv'd ye for some more noble use; Wrack't desperately; our men, and all consum'd, But we two; that still live, and spin out The thin and ragged threds of our misfortunes. Alb. Is there no meat above? Sebast. Nor meat nor quiet; No summer here, to promise any thing; Nor Autume, to make full the reapers hands; The earth obdurate to the teares of heaven, Let's nothing shoot but poysoned weeds. No Rivers, nor no pleasant Groves, no beasts; All that were made for mans use, flye this desart; No aÃ«ry fowle dares makes his flight over it, It is so ominous. Serpents, and ugly things, the shames of nature, Roots of malignant tastes, foule standing waters; Sometimes we finde a fulsome Sea-root, And that's a delicate: a Rat sometimes And that we hunt like Princes in their pleasure; And when we take a Toad, we make a Banquet. Amint. For heavens sake let's aboord. Alb. D'ee know no farther? Nicusa. Yes, we have sometimes seen the shaddow of a place inhabited; And heard the noyse of hunters; And have attempted to finde it, so far as a River, Deep, slow, and dangerous, fenced with high Rocks, We have gone; but not able to atchieve that hazard, Returne to our old miseries. If this sad story, may diserve your pitties, Alb. Ye shall aboord with us, we will relieve your miseries: Sebast. Nor will we be unthankfull for this benefit; No Gentlemen, wee'le pay for our deliverance; Look ye that plough the Seas for wealth and pleasures, That out-runne day and night with your ambitions, Looke on those heaps, they seeme hard ragged quarries; Remove 'em, and view 'em fully. Mast. O heaven, they are Gold and Jewels. Sebast. Be not too hasty, here lies another heape. Morill. And here another All perfect gold. Alb. Stand farther off, you must not be your own carvers; La-m. We have shares, and deep ones; Fran. Yes Sir, wee'le maintain't: ho fellow Saylors. La-m. Stand all to your freedomes; I'le have all this. Fran. And I this. Tib. You shall be hang'd first. La-m. My losses shall be made good. Fran. So shall mine, or with my sword I'le do't; All that will share with us, assist us. Tib. Captain let's set in. Alb. This money will undoe us, undoe us all: Sebast. This Gold was the overthrow of my happines; I had command too, when I landed here, And lead young, high, and noble spirits under me, This cursed Gold entising 'em, they set upon their Captain, On me that ow'nd this wealth, &amp; this poor Gentleman, Gave us no few wounds, forc'd us from our own; And then their civill swords, who should be owners, And who Lords over all, turn'd against their own lives, First in their rage consum'd the Ship, That poor part of the Ship that scap't the first wracke, Next their lives by heaps; O be you wise and carefull: La-m. Wee'le ha more: Sirah, come show it. Fran. Or ten times worse afflictions then thou speak'st of. Alb. Nay, and ye will be Doggs. beats 'em out. Tib. Let me come Captaine: This Golden age must have an Iron ending. Have at the bunch. he beats 'em off. Exit. Amint. O Albert; O Gentlemen; O friends. Exit. Sebast. Come noble Nephew, if we stay here, we dye, Here rides their Ship, yet all are gone toth' spoyle, Let's make a quick use. Nicus. Away deer Uncle. Sebast. This Gold was our overthrow. Exit. Nicus. It may now be our happinesse. Enter Tibalt and the rest. Tib. You shall have gold: yes, I'le crambe it int'ee; You shall be your own carvers; yes, I'le carve ye. Morill. I am sore, I pray heare reason: Tib. I'le heare none. Covetous base mindes have no reason; I am hurt my self; but whil'st I have a Legge left, I will so haunt your guilded soules; how dee Captain? Ye bleed apace, curse on the causers ont; Ye doe not faint? Alb. No, no; I am not so happy. Tib. D'ee howle, nay, ye deserve it: Base greedy rogues; come, shall we make an end of 'em? Alb. They are our country-men, for heavens sake spare em, Alas, they are hurt enough: &amp; they relent now. Aminta above. Amint. O Captain, Captain. Alb. Whose voyce is that? Tib. The Ladies. Amint. Look Captain, look; ye are undone: poore Captain, We are all undone: all, all: we are all miserable, Mad wilfull men; ye are undone, your ship, your Ship. Alb. What of her? Amint. Shee's under Sayle and floating; See where she flies: see to your shames, you wretches: Those poor starv'd things, that shewed you Gold. La-m. and Franvile goes up to see the Ship. 1 Saylor. They have cut the Cables, And got her out; the tyde too has befrinded em. Mast. Where are the Saylors that kept her? Boatsw. Here, here in the mutiny, to take up mony, And left no creature, left the Boat a shoare too, This Gold, this damn'd enticing Gold. 2 Saylor. How the wind drives her, As if it vied to force her from our furies? La-m. Come back good old men: Fran. Good honest men, come back. Tib. The winds against ye, speak lowder; La-m. Ye shall have all your Gold againe: they see us. Tib. Hold up your hands, and kneele, And houle ye blockheads; they'le have compassion on ye; Yes, yes, 'tis very likely: ye have deserv'd it, D'ee look like Doggs now? Are your mighty courages abated? Alb. I bleed apace Tibalt: Tib. Retire Sir; and make the best use of our miseries. They but begin now. Enter Aminta; Amint. Are ye alive still? Alb. Yes sweet. Tib. Help him off Lady; And wrap him warme, in your Armes, Here's something that's comfortable; off with him handsomely, Il'e come to ye straight: but vex these rascals a little. Exit Albert Aminta. Fran. Oh! I am hungry, &amp; hurt, and I am weary. Tib. Here's a Pestle of a Portigue, Sir; 'Tis excellent meat, with soure sauce; And here's two Chaines, suppose 'em Sausages; Then there wants Mustar'd. But the fearefull Surgeon will supply ye presently: La-m. O for that Surgeon, I shall dye else. Tib. Faith, there he lies in the same pickle too. Surg. My salves, and all my Instruments are lost; And I am hurt, and starv'd; Good Sir, seeke for some Hearbs. Tib. Here's Hearbe gracelesse; will that serve? Gentlemen, will ye goe to Supper! All. Where's the meat? Tib. Where's the meat? what a Veale voyce is there? Fran. Would we had it Sir, or any thing else; Tib. I would now cut your throat you Dogge, But that I wo not doe you such a curtesie; To take you from the benefit of starving. O! what a comfort will your worship have, some three dayes hence? Yea things beneath pitty shall be your harbinger; You must not look for down-beds here, Nor Hangings; though I could wish ye strong on's; Yet here be many lightsome coole Star-chambers, Open to every sweet ayre, I'le assure ye, Ready provided for ye, and so I'le leave ye; Your first course is serv'd, expect the second. Exit. Fran. A vengeance on these Jewels. La-m. O! this cursed Gold. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Albert, Aminta. Alb. Alas, deere soule ye faint. Amint. You speak the language Which I should use to you; heaven knows, my weaknes Is not for what I suffer in my selfe, But to imagine what you endure, and to what fate Your cruell Starrs reserve ye. Alb. Doe not adde to my afflictions By your tender pitties; sure we have chang'd Sexes; You bear calamity with a fortitude Would become a man; I like a weake girle suffer. Amint. O! but your wounds, How fearfully they gape? and every one To me is a Sepulchre; if I lov'd truly, Wse men affirm that true love can doe wonders, This bath'd in my warme teares, would soon be cur'd, And leave no orifice behind; pray give me leave To play the Surgeon, and bind 'em up; The raw ayre rancles 'em. Alb. Sweet, we want meanes. Amint. Love can supply all wants. Alb. What have ye done Sweet? Oh sacriledge to beauty: there's no haire Of these pure locks, by which the greatest King Would not be gladly bound, and love his Fetters. Amint. O Albert, I offer this sacrifice of service To the Altar of your staid temperance, and still adore it; When with a violent hand you made me yours, I cursed the doer: but now I consider, How long I was in your power? and with what honour You entertain'd me? it being seldome seen, That youth and heat of blood could ere prescribe Laws to it selfe; your goodnesse is the Lethe, In which I drown your injuries, and now live Truly to serve ye: how doe you Sir? Receive you the least ease from my service? If you doe, I am largely recompenc'd. Alb. You good Angels, That are ingag'd, when mans ability failes, To reward goodnesse: look upon this Lady Though hunger gripes my croaking entrailes, Yet when I kisse these rubies, me thinkes I'm at a banquet a refreshing banquet; Speak my blesse't one art not hungry? Amint. Indeed I could eat, to beare you company. Alb. Blush unkind nature, If thou hast power: or being to heare Thy self, and by such innocence accus'd; Must Print a thousand kinds of shames, upon Thy various face: canst thou supply a drunkard, And with a prodigall hand, reach choice of wines, Till he cast up thy blessings? or a glutton, That robbs the Elements, to sooth his palat, And only eats to beget Appetite, Not to be satisfied? and suffer here A Virgin, which the Saints would make their guest, To pine for hunger? ha, if my sence Hornes within. Deceive me not, these notes take being From the breath of men; confirme me my Aminta; Again, this way the gentle wind conveyes it to us, Heare you nothing? Amint. Yes, it seemes free hunters Musicke; Alb. Still 'tis lowder; and I remember the Portugals Inform'd us, they had often heard such sounds, But ne're could touch the shore from whence it came; Follow me, my Aminta: my good genius, Shew me the way still; still we are directed; When we gaine the top of this neer rising hill Exit. and Enter above. We shall know further. Alb. Curteous Zephyrus On his dewie wings, carries perfumes to cheer us; The ayre cleers too; And now, we may discerne another Island, And questionlesse, the seat of fortunate men: O that we could arrive there; Amint. No Albert, 'tis not to be hop'd; This envious Torrent's cruelly interpos'd; We have no Vessell that may transport us; Nor hath nature given us wing's to flye. Alb. Better try all hazards, Then perish here remedilesse; I feele New vigor in me, and a spirit that dares More then a man, to serve my faire Aminta; These Armes shall be my oares, with which I'le swim; And my zeale to save thy innocent selfe, Like wings, shall beare me up above the brackish waves. Amin. Well ye then leave me? Alb. Till now I nere was wretched. My best Aminta, I sweare by goodnesse Tis nor hope, nor feare, of my selfe, that invites me To this extreame; tis to supply thy wants; and believe me Though pleasure met me in most ravishing formes, And happinesse courted me to entertaine her, I would nor eate nor sleepe till I return'd And crown'd thee with my fortunes. Amin. O but your absence. Alb. Suppose it but a dream; and as you may, Endeavour to take rest; and when that sleep Deceives your hunger with imagin'd food, Thinke you have sent me for discovery Of some most fortunate Continent, yet unknown, Which you are to be Queen of. And now ye Powers that ere heard Lovers prayers, Or cherisht pure affection, looke on him That is your Votary; and make it known Against all stops, you can defend your own. Exit. Enter Hippolita, Crocale, Juletta. Hip. How did we lose Clarinda? Cro. When we beliv'd the Stag was spent, and would take soyle, The sight of the blacke Lake which we suppos'd He chose for his last refuge, frighted him more Then we that did pursue him. Jul. That's usuall; for, death it selfe is not so terrible To any beast of chase. Hip. Since we liv'd here, we nere could force one to it. Cro. Tis so dreadfull, Birds that with their pinions cleave the Ayre Dare not flie over it: when the Stag turn'd head, And we even tyred with labour, Clarinda, as if She were made of Ayre and Fire, And had no part of earth in her, eagerly pursu'd him; Nor need we feare her safety, this place yeelds not Fawnes nor Satyres, or more lustfull men; Here we live secure, And have among our selves a Common-wealth, Which in our selves begun, with us must end. Jul. I there's the misery. Cro. But being alone, Allow me freedome but to speake my thoughts; The strictnesse of our Governesse, that forbids us On pain of death the sight and use of men, Is more then tyranny: for her selfe, shee's past Those youthfull heats, and feeles not the want Of that which young mayds long for: and her daughter The faire Clarinda, though in few yeeres Improv'd in height and large proportion, Came here so young, That scarce remembring that she had a father, She never dreames of man; and should she see one, In my opinion, a would appeare a strange beast to her. Jul. Tis not so with us. Hip. For my part, I confesse it, I was not made For this single life; nor doe I love hunting so, But that I had rather be the Chace my selfe. Cro. By Venus (out upon me) I should have sworn By Diana, I am of thy mind too wench; And though I have tane an Oath, not alone To detest, but never to thinke of man, Every houre something tels me I am forsworn; For I confesse imagination helps me sometimes, And that's all is left for us to feed on, We might starve else; for if I have any pleasure In this life, but when I sleep, I am a Pagan; Then from the Courtier to the Country clown, I have strange visions. Jul. Visions Crocale? Cro. Yes, and fine visions too; And visions I hope in dreames are harmlesse, And not forbid by our Canons; the last night (Troth tis a foolish one, but I must tell it) As I lay in my cabin betwixt sleeping and waking, Hip. Upon your backe? Cro. How should a young mayd lie, foole, When she would be intranc'd? Hip. We are instructed; forward I prethee. Cro. Me thought a sweet young man In yeeres, some twenty, with a downy chin, Promising a future beard, and yet no red one, Stole slylie to my cabin, all unbrac'd, Tooke me in his armes, and kiss'd me twenty times, Yet still I slept. Jul. Fie; thy lips run over Crocale. But to the rest. Cro. Lord, what a man is this thought I, To doe this to a mayd! Yet then for my life I could not wake. The youth, a little danted, with a trembling hand Heav'd up the clothes. Hip. Yet still you slept. Cro. Yfaith I did; and when, methoughts, he was warm by my side, Thinking to catch him, I stretcht out both mine armes; And when I felt him not, I shreekt out, And wak'd for anger. Hip. Twas a pretty dream. Enter Albert. Cro. I, if it had been a true one. Jul. But stay, what's here cast oth' shore? Hip. Tis a man; Shall I shoot him? Cro. No, no, tis a handsome beast; Would we had more o'the breed; stand close wenches, And let's heare if he can speake. Alb. Doe I yet live? Sure it is ayre I breathe; what place is this? Sure something more then humane keeps residence here, For I have past the Stygian gulph, And touch upon the blessed shore? tis so; This is the Elizian shade; these happy spirits, That here enjoy all pleasures. Hip. He makes towards us. Jul. Stand, or Ile shoot. Cro. Hold, he makes no resistance. Alb. Be not offended Goddesses, that I fall Thus prostrate at your feet: or if not such, But Nymphs of Dian's traine, that range these groves, Which you forbid to men; vouchsafe to know I am a man, a wicked sinfull man; and yet not sold So far to impudence, as to presume To presse upon your privacies, or provoke Your Heavenly angers; tis not for my selfe I beg thus poorely, for I am already wounded, Wounded to death, and faint; my last breath Is for a Virgin comes as neere your selves In all perfection, as whats mortall may Resemble things divine. O pitty her, And let your charity free her from that desart, If Heavenly charity can reach to hell, For sure that place comes neere it: and where ere My ghost shall finde abode, Eternally I shall powre blessings on ye. Hip. By my life I can not hurt him. Cro. Though I lose my head for it, nor I. Enter Clarinda. I must pitty him and will. Jul. But stay, Clarinda. Cla. What new game have ye found here, ha! What beast is this lies wallowing in his gore? Cro. Keep off. Cla. Wherefore, I pray? I nere turn'd From a fell Lionesse rob'd of her whelps, And shall I feare dead carrion? Jul. O but. Cla. But, what ist? Hip. It is infectious. Cla. Has it not a name? Cro. Yes, but such a name from which As from the divell your mother commands us flie. Cla. Is it a man? Cro. It is. Cla. What a brave shape it has in death; How excellent would it appeare had it life! Why should it be infectious? I have heard My mother say I had a father, And was not he a man? Cro. Questionlesse Maddam. Cla. Your fathers too were men? Jul. Without doubt Lady. Cla. And without such it is impossible We could have been. Hip. A sinne against nature to deny it. Cla. Nor can you or I have any hope to be a mother Without the helpe of men. Cro. Impossible. Cla. Which of you then most barbarous, that knew You from a man had being, and owe to it The name of parent, durst presume to kill The likenesse of that thing by which you are? Whose Arrowes made these wounds? speake, or by Dian Without distinction Ile let fly at ye all. Jul. Not mine. Hip. Nor mine. Cro. 'Tis strange to see her mov'd thus. Restraine your fury Maddam; had we kild him, We had but perform'd your mothers command. Cla. But if she command unjust and cruell things, We are not to obey it. Cro. We are innocent; some storm did cast Him shipwrackt on the shore, as you see, wounded: Nor durst we be Surgeons to such Your mother doth appoint for death. Cla. Weake excuse; where's pity? Where's soft compassion? cruel, and ungratefull! Did providence offer to your charity But one poore Subject to expresse it on, And in't to shew our wants too; and could you So carelesly neglect it? Hip. For ought I know, he's living yet; And you may tempt your mother, by giving him succour. Cla. Ha, come neere I charge ye. So, bend his body softly; rub his temples; Nay, that shall be my Office: how the red Steales into his pale lips! run and fetch the simples With which my mother heald my arme When last I was wounded by the Bore. Cro. Doe: but remember her to come after ye, That she may behold her daughters charity. Cla. Now he breathes; Exit Hippolita. The ayre passing through the Arabian groves Yeelds not so sweet an odour: prethee taste it; Taste it good Crocale; yet I envy thee so great a blessing; Tis not sinne to touch thesr Rubies, is it? Iul. Not, I thinke. Cla. Or thus to live Camelion like? I could resigne my essence to live ever thus. O welcome; raise him up Gently. Some soft hand Bound up these wounds; a womans haire. What fury For which my ignorance does not know a name, Is crept into my bosome? But I forget Enter Hipolita. My pious work. Now if this juyce hath power, Let it appeare; his eyelids ope: Prodigious! Two Sunnes breake from these Orbes. Alb. Ha, where am I? what new vision's this? To what Goddesse doe I owe this second life? Sure thou art more then mortall: And any Sacrifice of thanks or duty In poor and wretched man to pay, comes short Of your immortall bounty: but to shew I am not unthankfull, thus in humility I kisse the happy ground you have made sacred By bearing of your waight. Cla. No Goddesse, friend: but made Of that same brittle mould as you are; One too acquainted with calamities, And from that apt to pity. Charity ever Findes in the act reward, and needs no Trumpet In the receiver. O forbeare this duty; I have a hand to meet with yours, And lips to bid yours welcome. Cro. I see, that by instinct. Though a young mayd hath never seen a man, Touches have tittulations, and inform her. Enter Rosella. But here's our Governesse; Now I expect a storme. Ros. Child of my flesh, And not of my faire unspotted mind, Un-hand this monster. Cla. Monster, mother? Ros. Yes; and every word he speakes, a Syrens note, To drowne the carelesse hearer. Have I not taught thee The falshood and the perjuries of men? On whom, but for a woman to shew pity, Is to be cruell to her selfe; the soveraignty Proud and imperious men usurpe upon us, We conferre on our selves, and love those fetters We fasten to our freedomes. Have we, Clarinda, Since thy fathers wrack, sought liberty, To lose it un-compeld? did fortune guide, Or rather destiny, our Barke, to which We could appoint no Port, to this blest place, Inhabited heretofore by warlike women, That kept men in subjection? did we then By their example, after we had lost All we could love in man, here plant our selves, With execrable oathes never to looke On man, but as a monster? and wilt thou Be the first president to infringe those vows We made to Heaven? Cla. Heare me; and heare me with justice. And as ye are delighted in the name Of mother, heare a daughter that would be like you. Should all women use this obstinate abstinence, You would force upon us; in a few yeeres The whole world would be peopled Onely with beasts. Hip. We must and will have men. Cro. I or wee'l shake off all obedience. Ros. Are ye mad? Can no perswasion alter ye? suppose You had my suffrage to your sute; Can this Shiprackt wretch supply them all? Alb. Hear me great Lady? I have fellowes in my misery, not far hence, Divided only by this hellish River, There live a company of wretched men Such as your charity may make your slaves; Imagine all the miseries mankind May suffer under: and they groane beneath em. Cla. But are they like to you? Jul. Speak they your Language? Cro. Are they able, lusty men? Alb. They were good Ladyes; And in their May of youth of gentle blood, And such as may deserve ye; now cold and hunger Hath lessen'd their perfection: but restor'd To what they were, I doubt not they'l appeare Worthy your favours. Jul. This is a blessing We durst not hope for. Cla. Deere Mother, be not obdurate. Ros. Hear then my resolution: and labour not To add to what i'le grant, for 'twill be fruitlesse, You shall appear as good angels to these wretched men; In a small Boat wee'l passe o're to 'em; And bring 'em comfort: if you like their persons, And they approve of yours: for wee'l force nothing; And since we want ceremonies, Each one shall choose a husband, and injoy His company a month, but that expird You shall no more come neer 'em; if you prove fruitful, The Males yee shall return to them, the Females We will reserve our selves: this is the utmost, Yee shall 'ere obtaine: as yee think fit; Yee may dismisse this stranger, And prepare to morrow for the journey. Exit. Cla. Come Sir, will ye walke? We will shew ye our pleasant Bowers, And something yee shall find to cheer your heart. Alb. Excellent Lady; Though 'twill appear a wonder one neer starv'd Should refuse rest and meat, I must not take Your noble offer: I left in yonder desart A Virgin almost pind. Cla. Shee's not your wife? Alb. No Lady, but my sister (tis now dangerous To speak truth) to her I deeply vow'd Not to tast food or rest, if fortune brought it me, Till I bless'd her with my returne: now if you please To afford me an easie passage to her, And some meat for her recovery, I shall live your slave: and thankfully Shee shall ever acknowledge her life at your service. Cla. You plead so well, I can deny ye nothing; I my selfe will see you furnisht; And with the next Sun visit and relieve thee. Alb. Yee are all goodnesseâ Exit.</field>

Or, but the paper where such a Cordiall Potion or Pils hath bin entombd. Fran. Or, the blest bladder where a cooling glister Mor. Hast thou no searcloths left? Nor any old poulties? Fran. We care not to what it hath bin ministred. Sur. Sure I have none of these dainties Gentlemen. Fran. Wher's the great Wen Thou cutst from Hugh the saylers shoulder? That would serve now for a most Princely banquet. Sur. I, if we had it Gentlemen. I flung it over-board, slave that I was; Lam. A most unprovident villaine. Sur. If I had any thing that were but supple now! I could make sallads of your shoos Gentlemen, And rare ones: any thing unctious. Mor. I and then we might fry the soales 'ith Sun. The soales would make a second dish. Lam. Or, souce 'em in the salt-water, An inner soale well souc'd. En. Aminta Fran. Here comes the Woman; It may be she has meat and may relieve us, Lets withdraw, and marke and then be ready, Shee'l hide her store els, and so cozen us. Amin. How weary and how hungry am I, How feeble and how faint is all my body? Mine eyes like spent Lamps glowing out grow heavy, My sight forsaking me and all my spirits, As if they heard my passing bell go for me, Pull in their powers and give me up to destiny, Oh! for a little water: a little little meat, A little to relieve me ere I perish: I had whole floods of tears awhile that norisht me, But they are all consum'd for thee deere Albert; For thee they are spent, for thou art dead; Mercilesse fate hath swallowd thee. OhâI grow heavy: sleep is a salve for misery; Heaven look on me, and either take my life, Or make me once more happy. Lam. SHee's fast asleep already, Why should shee have this blessing, and we wake still, Wake to our wants? Mor. This thing hath bin our overthrow, And all these biting mischieves that fall on us Are come through her means. Fran. True we were bound yee all know, For happy places and most fertill islands, Where we had constant promises of all things, Shee turn'd the Captaines minde, And must have him go in search, I know not of who, Nor to what end: of such a foole her brother, And such a coxcomb her kinsman, and we must put in every where, She has put us in now yfaith. Lam. Why should we consume thus, and starve, Have nothing to relieve us; And shee live there that bred all our miseries, Unrosted or unsod? Mor. I have read in stories. Lam. Of such restoring meates, We have examples; Thousand examples and allow'd for excellent; Women that have eate their Children, Men their slaves, nay their brothers: but these are nothing; Husbands devoured their wives (they are their chattels,) And of a Schoolemaster that in a time of famine, Powdered up all his Schollers. Mor. Shee's young and tydie, In my conscience shee'l eate delicatly; Just like young Porke a little lean, Your opinion Surgeon. Sur. I think shee may be made good meat. But look we shall want Salt. Fran. Tush, she needs no powdering, Sur. I grant ye; But to suck out the humorous parts: by all means, Lets kill her in a chafe, shee'l eat the sweeter. Lam. Lets kill her any way: and kill her quickly, That we might be at our meat. Sur. How if the Captaine? Mor. Talk not of him, hee's dead, and the rest famish'd. Wake her Surgeon, and cut her throate, And then divide her, every man his share. Fran. Shee wakes her selfe. Amin. Holy and good things keep me! What cruell dreames have I had! who are these? O they are my friends; for heavens sake Gentlemen Give me some food to save my life: if ye have ought to spare; A little to relieve me: I may blesse yee; For weake and wretched, ready to perish Even now I die. Mor. You'l save a labour then, You bred these miseries, and you shall pay for't; We have no meat, nor where to have we know not, Nor how to pull our selves from these afflictions, We are starv'd too, famisht, all our hopes deluded; Yet ere we die thus, wee'l have one deinty meale. Amin. Shall I be with ye Gentlemen? Lam. Yes mary shall yee: in our bellies Lady. We love you wellâ Amin. What said you sir? Lam. Mary wee'l eat your Ladiship. Fran. You that have buried us in this base Island, Wee'l bury ye in a more noble Monument. Sur. Will ye say your prayers, that I may perform Lady? We are wondrous sharp set; come Gentlemen, Who are for the hinder parts? Mor. I. Fran. I. Lam. And I. Sur. Be patient; They will not fall to every mans share. Amin. O hear me; Hear me ye barbarous men. Mor. Be short and pithy. Our stomakes cannot stay a long discourse. Sur. And be not fearfull, For i'le kill ye daintily. Amin. Are ye not Christians? Lam. Why, do not Christians eat women? En. Tibalt Master, Saylors. Amin. Eat one another? tis most impious. Sur. Come come. Amin. Oh, help, help, help. Tib. The Ladies voyce! stand off slaves, What do you intend villains? I have strength enough left me, if you abuse this soule, Toâ Ma. They would have ravisht her upon my life, Speak, how was it Lady? Amin. Forgive 'em, 'twas their hungers. Tib. Ha, their hungers! Ma. They would have eaten her. Tib. O dam'd villains; speak, is it true? Sur. I confesse an appetite. Tib. An appetite, i'le fit ye for an appetite. Are ye so sharp set that her flesh must serve you? Murther's a maine good service with your worships; Since ye would be such devils, Why did you not begin with one another handsomly, And spare the woman to beget more food on? Amin. Good Sir. Tib. You shall grow mumey rascals; I'le make you fall to your brawnes and your buttocks, And worry one another like keen bandoggs. Amin. Good sir be mercifull. Tib. You shall know what tis to be damnd Canibals. Amin. O my best friend! Enter Albert. Al. Alas poor heart! here, Here's some meat and soveraigne drink to ease you, Sit down gentle Sweet. Amin. I am blest to see you. Tib. Sir, not within forty foot of this food, If you do dogs! All. Oh, Captain Captain, Captain. Alb. Ye shall have meat all of you. Tib. Captain, hear me first: hark, Tis so inhumane! I would not ha the aire corrupted with it. Alb. O barbarous men! sit down Dupont, Good Master and honest Saylors. Tib. But stand you off, And waite upon our charity; i'le wait on you els; And touch nothing but what's flung t'ee; as if you were dogs; If you do, i'le cut your fingers; friends I'le spoyle your carving. Amin. There wretches there. Tib. Eat your meate handsomly now, And give Heaven thanks. Alb. There's more bread. Tib. See they snarle like dogs; Eat quietly you rascals, eat quietly. Alb. There is drink too. Tib. Come, come, i'le fill you each your cups, Ye shal not surfet. Amin. And what have you discovered? Alb. Sweet, a paradise, A paradise inhabited with Angels, Such as you are: their pitties makt 'em angels, They gave me these viands, and supply'd me With these pretious drinks. Amin. Shall not we see 'em? Alb. Yes, they will see you Out of their charities, having heard our story They will come, and comfort us, come presently We shall no more know wants nor miseries. Amin. Are they all women? Alb. All, and all in love with us. Amin. How! Alb. Do not mistake: in love with our misfortunes, They will cherish and relieve our men. Tib. Do you shrug now, And pull up your noses? you smell comfort, See they stretch out their Legs, like dottrels, Each like a new Saint Dennis. Alb. Deere Mistris, When you would name me, and the women hear, Call me your brother, you i'le call my sister, And pray observe this allâ Why do you change colour sweet. Amin. Eating too much meat. Alb. Sawce with jealousie; Fie, fie deer saint, y faith ye are too blame, Are ye not here? here fixt in my heart? En. Rossellia, Clarinda, Crocale, Hipollitta Iuletta. All. Hark, hark; Alb. They are come, stand ready, &amp; look nobly, And with all humble reverence receive 'em, Our lives depend upon their gentle pitties, And death waits on their anger. Mor. Sure they are Fairies. Tib. Be they devils: devils of flesh and blood; After so long a Lent, and tedious voyage To me they are angels. Fran. O for some Eringoes! Lam. Potatoes or Cantharides. Tib. Peace you rouges that buy abilities of your pothecaries, Had I but took the diet of green Cheese, And Onions for a month, I could do wonders. Ros. Are these the Jewels you run mad for? What can you see in one of these To whom you would vouchsafe a gentle touch? Can nothing perswade you To love your selves, and place your happinesse In cold and chast enbraces of each other. Ju. This is from the purpose. Hip. We had your grant to have them as they were. Cla. Tis a beauteous Creature, And to my selfe, I do appeare deform'd, When I consider her, and yet shee is The strangers sister; why then should I fear? Shee cannot prove my rivall. Ros. VVhen you repent, That you refus'd my councell, may it add To your afflictions, that you were forward; Yet leap'd into the Gulfe of your misfortunes, But have your wishes. Mast. Now she makes to us. Amin. I am instructed, but take heed Albert, You prove not false; Alb. Ye are your own assurance, And so acquainted with your own perfections, That weak doubts cannot reach you; therefore fear not. Ros. That you are poor and miserable men, My eyes inform me: that without our succours, Hope cannot flatter you to dream of safety; The present plight you are in, can resolve you That to be mercifull, is to draw near The Heavenly essence: whether you wilbe Thankfull, I do not question; nor demand VVhat country bred you, what names, what maners; To us it is sufficient we relieve Such as have shapes of men: and I command you, As we are not ambitious to know Farther of you, that on paine of death You presume not to enquire what we are Or whence deriv'd. Alb. In all things we obey you, And thankfully we ever shall confesse Our selves your creatures. Ros. You speak as becomes you; First then and willingly deliver up Those weapons we could force from you. Alb. VVe lay 'em down Most gladly art your feet. Tib. I have had many a combat with a tall wench; But never was disarm'd before. Ros. And now hear comfort, Your wants shalbe supplied, and though it be A debt women may challenge to be sued to, Especially from such they may command; VVe give up to you that power, and therefore Freely each make his choyce. Fran. Then here I fix. Mor. Nay, she is mine: I eyed her first. Lam. This mine. Tib. Stay good rascals; You are too forward, sir Gallant, You are not giving order to a Taylor For the fashion of a new suit; Nor are you in your warehouse, master Merchant, Stand back and give your betters leave: your betters; And grumble not; if ye do, as I love meat I will so swinge the salt itch out on you. Captaine, Master and the rest of us, That are brothers and good fellows: we have bin Too late by the ears: and yet smart for our follies; To end therefore all future emulation: if you please, To trust to my election, you shall say, I am not partiall to my selfe; I doubt not Give content to all. All, Agreed, agreed. Tib. Then but observe how learned and discreetly, I wil proceed, and as a skilfull Doctor In all the quirks belonging to the game; Read over your complexions: for you Captaine Beinst first in place and therefore first to be serv'd, I give my judgement thus, for your aspect Y'are much inclind to melancholy: and that tels me The sullen Saturue had predominance At your nativity, a malignant planet, And if not qualified by a sweet conjunction Of a soft and ruddy wench born under Venus, It may prove fatall: therefore to your armes, I give this rose-cheekt Virgin. Cla. To my wish; Till now I never was happy. Amin. Nor I accurs'd. Tib. Master, you are old; Yet love the game, that I perceive too, And if not well spurd up, you may prove rusty; Therefore to help ye here's a Bradamanta, Or I am cosend in my calculation. Cro. A poore old man alloted to my share. Ti. Thou wouldst have two; Nay I think twenty: but fear not wench, Though he be old he's tough: look on's making, Hee'l not fayle I warant thee. Ros. A merry fellow, And were not man a creature I detest, I could indure his company. Ti. Here's a fayre heard of Does before me, And now for a barren one: For though I like the sport: I do not love To Father children: like the grand signior, Thus I walk in my Seraglio, And vew 'em as I passe: then draw I forth My handkercher; and having made my choyce, I thus bestow it. Ros. On me. Ti. On you: now my choyce is made; To it you hungry rascals. Alb. Excellent. Amin. As I love goodnesse, It makes me smile ith height of all my feares. Cla. What a strong contention you may behold Between my Mothers mirth and anger. Ti. Nay, no coynesse: be mistrisse of your word, I must and will enjoy you. Ros. Be adviz'd foole: alas I am old; How canst thou hope content from one that's fifty. Ti. Never talke on't; I have known good ones at threescore and upwards; Besides the weathers hot: and men That have experience, fear feavers: A temperate diet is the only physick, Your Julips nor Gujacum prunello's, Champhire pils, nor Goord-water, Come not neer your old woman; Youthfull stomackes are still craving, Though their be nothing left to stop their mouths with; And believe me I am no frequent giver of those bounties: Laugh on: laugh on: good Gentlemen do, I shall make holiday and sleep, when you Dig in the mines till your hearts ake. Ros. A mad fellow; Well Sir, i'le give you hearing: and as I like Your wooing and discourse: but I must tell ye sir, That rich widdowes look for great sums in present, Or assurances of ample joynters. Ti. That to me is easie, For instantly i'le do it, hear me comrades. Alb. What sayst thou Tibalt? Tib. Why, that to woe a wench with empty hands Is no good heraldy, therefore lets to the gold, And share it equally: 'twill speak for us More then a thousand complements or cringes, Ditties stolne from Patrick, or discourse from Ovid, Besides 'twill beget us respect, And if ever fortune friend us with a Barque, Largly supply us with all provision. Alb. Well advis'd, defer it not. Ti. Are ye all contented. All. We are? Ti. Lets away then, Straight wee'l returne, And you shall see our riches. Exit. Ros. Since I know what wonder and amazement was, I neer was so transported. Cla. Why weep ye gentle mayd? There is no danger here to such as you; Banish fear: for with us I dare promise, You shall meet all courteous entertainment. Cro. We esteem our selves most happy in you. Hip. And blesse fortune that brought you hither. Cla. Hark in your eare; I love you as a friend already, Ere long you shall call me by a neerer name, I wish your brother well: I know you apprehend me. Amin. I to my griefe I do; Alas good Ladies, there is nothing left me But thanks to pay ye with. Enter Albert, Tibalt, and the rest with treasure. Clar. That's more Then yet you stand ingaged for. Ros. So soon returnd! Alb. Hear: see the idoll of the Lapidary. Ti. These Pearls for which the slavish Negro Dives to the bottome of the Sea. Lam. To get which the industrious Merchant Touches at either pole. Fran. The never-fayling purchase Of Lordships and of honors. Mor. The worlds Mistris, That can give every thing to the possessors. Ma. For which the Saylors scorn tempestuous winds, And spit defiance in the Sea. Ti. Speak Lady: look we not lovely now? Ros. Yes: yes, O my Starrs Be now for ever blest, that have brought To my revenge these robbers; take your arrowes, And nayle these monsters to the earth. Alb. What mean ye Lady? In what have we offended? Ros. O my daughter! And you companions with me in all fortunes, Look on these Caskets and these Jewels. These were our own, when first we put to Sea With good Sebastian: and these the Pyrats That not alone depriv'd him of this treasure, But also took his life. Cro. Part of my present I well remember was mine own. Hip. And these were mine. Ju. Sure, I have worne this Jewel. Ros. Wherefore do ye stay then, And not performe my command? Al. O Heaven! What cruell fate pursues us. Ti. I am well enough serv'd, That must be offring jointures, Jewels, And precious stones more then I brought with me. Ros. Why, shoote ye not? Cla. Heare me deere Mother; And when the greatest cruelty, is Justice, Do not shew mercy: death to these starv'd wretches Is a reward, not punishment: let 'em live To undergoe the full weight of your displeasure. And that they may have sence to feel the torments They have deserv'd: allow 'm some small pittance, To linger out their tortures. Ros. Tis well counsell'd. All. And wee'l follow it; Heare us speake. Ros. Peace dogs. Bind 'em fast: when fury hath given way to reason, I will determine of their sufferings, Which shall be horrid. Vengeance, though slow pac'd, At length oretakes the guilty; and the wrath Of the incensed powers will fall most sure On wicked men, when they are most secure. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quartus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Raymond, Sebastian, Nicusa, Saylors. 1. Sayl. Heres nothing, sir, but poverty and hunger; No promise of inhabitance; neither tract of Beast, Nor foot of man: we have searcht All this Rocky desart, yet cannot discover any assurance Here is or hath been such men. 2. Sayl. Not a relique of any thing they wore; Nor marke left by 'em, either to finde reliefe, Or to warne others from the like misfortune. Believe it, these fellows are both false, And to get a little succour in their misery, Have fram'd this cunning tale. Ray. The ship, I know, is French, and own'd by Pirats, If not by Albert my arch enemy. You told me too there was a woman with 'em. A young and handsome woman. Sebast. There was so sir. Raym. And such and such young gallants. Nic. We told ye true sir, That they had no means to quit this Island. Raym. And that amidst their mutiny to save your lives You got their ship. Sebast. All is most certaine sir. Raym. Where are they then? where are these men Or woman? we are landed where your faiths Did assure us we could not misse their sights. For this news we tooke ye to our mercy, Reliev'd ye, when the furious Sea and famine Strove which should first devoure ye; Cloath'd, and cherisht ye; us'd ye as those ye say ye are. Faire Gentlemen, now keep your words, And shew us this company, your own free pitties spoke of; These men ye left in misery; the woman. Men of those noble breedings you pretend to. Should scorn to lie, or get their food with falshood; Come, direct us. Sebast. Alasse sir, they are gone, But by what means or providence, we know not. 2. Sayl. Was not the Captain A fellow of a fiery, yet brave nature, A middle stature, and of brown complexion? Nic. He was sir. Raym. 'Twas Albert, And my poore wretched sister. 1. Sayl. Twas he certain, I ha been at Sea with him; many times at Sea. Raym. Come shew us these men; Shew us presently, and do not dally with us. Sab. We left 'em here; what should we say, sir? Here in this place. 2. Sayl. The earth cannot swallow 'em; They have no wings, they cannot fly sure. Raym. You told us too Of heapes of treasure, and of sums conceald, That set their hearts a fire; we see no such thing, No such sign; what can ye say to purge ye? What have ye done with these men? Nic. We, sir? Raym. You sir; For certain I believe ye saw such people. Sebast. By all that's good, By all that's pure and honest, By all that's holy. Raym. I dare not credit ye, Ye have so abus'd my hope, that now I hate ye. 1. Sayl. Lets put 'em in their ragged clothes again Captain, For certain they are knaves, lets e'en deliver 'em To their old fruitfull Farm; here let 'em walk the Island. Sebast. If ye do so, we shall curse your mercies. Nic. Rather put us to Sea again. Raym. Not so. Yet this Ile do, because ye say ye are Christians, Though I hardly credit it: bring in the boat, And all aboord again, but these two wretches; Yet leave 'em four daies meat. If in that time. (For I will search all nookes of this strange Island) I can discover any tract of these men, Alive or dead, Ile beare ye off, and honour ye; If not, ye have found your graves; so farewell. Exit. Nic. That goodnes dwels above, &amp; knows us innocent, Comfort our lives, and at his pleasure quit us. Sebast. Come cousin, come; old time will end our story: But no time (if we end well) ends our glory. Exit. Enter Rossella, Clarinda, Crocale, Hippolita, Juletta. Ros. Use 'em with all the austerity that may be, They are our slaves; turn all those pitties, Those tender reluctations that should become your sex, To stern anger; and when ye look upon 'em, Looke with those eyes that wept those bitter sorrows, Those cruelties ye sufferd by their rapines. Some five daies hence that blessed houre comes, Most happy to me, that knit this hand to my deare husbands, And both our hearts in mutuall bands. That houre Ladies. Cla. What of that houre? Ros. Why, on that houre daughter, And in the height of all our celebrations, Our deere remembrances of that deere man, And those that suffered with him, our faire kinsmen, Their lives shall fall a sacrifice to vengeance, Their lives that ruind his; tis a full justice. I will looke glorious in their bloods; And the most Noble spirit of Sebastian, That perisht by the pride of these French Pirates, Shall smile in Heaven, and blesse the hand that kild 'em. Looke strictly all unto your prisoners; For he that makes a scape beyond my vengeance, Or entertaines a hope by your faire usage; Take heed, I say, she that deceives my trust, Again take heed: her life, and thats but light neither; Her life in all the tortures my spirit can put on. All. We shall be carefull. Ros. Do so. Exit Rossella. Cla. Your are angry mother, and ye are old too, Forgetting what men are: but we shall temper ye. How fare your prisoners, Ladies? in what forms Do they appeare in their afflictions? Jul. Mine fare but poorly; For so I am commanded: tis none of their fault. Cla. Of what sort are they? Jul. They say they are Gentlemen. But they shew Mungrels. Cla. How do they suffer? Jul. Faith like boyes; They are fearfull in all fortunes; when I smile They kneele, and beg to have that face continued; And like poore slaves, adore the ground I goe on. When I frown, they hang their most dejected heads, Like fearfull sheephounds; shew 'em a crust of bread Theyl Saint me presently, and skip like Apes For a sup of Wine. Ile whip 'em like hackneys, Saddle 'em, ride 'em, do what I will with 'em. Cla. Tush, these are poore things. Have they names like Christians? Jul. Very faire names: Franvile, Lamure, and Morillat; And brag of great kindreds too. They offer very handsomely, But that I am a foole, and dare not venture. They are sound too i'my conscience, Or very neere upon't. Cla. Fy, away foole. Jul. They tell me If they might be brought before you, They would reveale things of strange consequence. Cla. Their base poore feares. Jul. I, that makes me hate 'em too; For if they were but manly to their sufferance, Sure I should strain a point or two. Cla. An houre hence Ile take a view of 'em, And heare their businesse. Are your men thus too? Cro. Mine? No gentle Maddam, mine were not cast In such base molds; afflictons, tortures, Are names and natures of delight, to my men; All sorts of cruelties they meet like pleasures. I have but two; the one they call Du-pont, Tibalt Du-pont; the other the ship-master. Cla. Have they not lives, and feares? Cro. Lives they have Maddam; But those lives never linkt to such companions As feares or doubts. Cla. Use 'em Nobly; And where you finde fit subjects for your pitties Let it become ye to be courteous; My mother will not alwaies be thus rigorous. Hip. Mine are Saylors Maddam, But they sleep soundly, and seldom trouble me, unlesse it be when They dream sometimes of fights and tempests; Then they rore and whistle for Cans of Wine, And down they fling me; and in that rage, (For they are violent fellows) they play such reaks. If they have meat, they thank me; If none, they heartily desire to be hangd quickly. And this is all they care. Cla. Look to 'em diligently, and where your pitties tels ye They may deserve, give comfort. All. We will. Exit. Cla. Come hither, be not frighted; Enter Aminta, Think not ye steale this liberty, for we give it, Your tender innocence assures me, Virgin, Ye had no share in those wrongs these men did us; I finde ye are not hardned in such mischieves. Your brother was mis-led sure, Foully mis-led. Amin. How much I feare these pities! Cla. Certain he was, so much I pity him; And for your sake, whose eyes plead for him; Nay, for his own sake. Amin. Ha! Cla. For I see about him Women have subtill eyes, and look narrowly; Or I am much abusd: many faire promises; Nay beyond those, too many shadowed vertues. Amin. I think he is good. Cla. I assure my selfe he will be; And out of that assurance take this comfort, For I perceive your feare hath much dejected ye. I love your brother. Amin. Maddam. Cla. Nay, do not take it for a dreamt of favour, That comforts in the sleepe, and awake vanishes; Indeed I love him. Amin. Do ye indeed? Cla. You doubt still, because ye feare his safety; Indeed he is the sweetest man I ere saw; I think the best. Ye may heare without blushes, And give me thanks, if ye please, for my curtesie. Amin. Maddam, I ever must; Yet witnesse Heaven, they are hard pul'd from me. Believe me, Maddam, so many imperfections I could find, (Forgive me Grace for lying) and such wants, (Tis to an honest use) such poverties, Both in his main proportion, and his mind too; There are a hundred handsomer; (I lie leudly) Your noble usage, Maddam, hath so bound me to ye, That I must tell ye. Cla. Come tell your worst. Amin. He is no husband for ye. I think ye mean in that fayr way. Cla. Ye have hit it. Amin. I am sure ye have hit my heart. You will finde him dangerous, Maddam; As fickle as the flying ayre, proud, jealous, Soon glutted in your sweets, and soon forgetfull; I could say more, and tell ye I have a brother, Another brother, that so far excels this, Both in the ornaments of man, and making. Cla. If you were not his sister, I should doubt ye mainly; Doubt ye for his love, ye deale so cunningly. Do not abuse me, I have trusted ye with more then life, With my first love; be carefull of me. Amin. In what use, Maddam? Cla. In this Lady, Speak to him for me, you have power upon him; Tell him I love him, tell him I dote on him. It will become your tongue. Amin. Become my grave. O fortune, O cursed fortune. Cla. Tell him his liberty, And all those with him; all our wealth and Jewels. Good sister, for Ile call ye so. Amin. I shall Lady, Even die, I hope. Cla. Here's Meat and Wine, pray take it, And there he lies; give him what liberty you please; But still conceald. What pleasure you shall please, sister. He shall nere want again. Nay, see an you'l take it; Why do you studdy thus? Amin. To avoyd mischiefes, if they should happen. Cla. Goe and be happy for me. Amin. O blind fortune; Yet happy thus far, I shall live to see him, In what strange desolation lives he here now? Sure this Curtaine will reveale. Enter Albert. Alb. Who's that? ha! Some gentle hand, I hope, to bring me comfort. Or if it be my death, tis sweetly shaddowed. Amin. Have ye forgot me sir? Alb. My Aminta? Amin. She sir, That walks here up and down an empty shadow, One that for some few houres But wanders here, carrying her own sad Coffin, Seeking some Desart place to lodge her greifes in. Alb. Sweet sorrow welcome, welcome noble griefe; How got you this faire liberty to see me? For sorrows in your shape are strangers to me. Amin. I come to counsell ye. Alb. Ye are still more welcome; For good friends in afflictions give good councels. Pray then proceed. Amin. Pray eate first, ye shew faint; Here's Wine to refresh ye too. Alb. I thank ye deere. Amin. Drinke again. Alb. Here's to our loves. How, turn and weepe! Pray pledge it: this happinesse we have yet left, Our hearts are free. Not pledge it? why, And though beneath the axe this health were holy, Why doe ye weep thus? Amin. I come to woe ye. Alb. To woe me Sweet? I am woe'd and wonne already, You know I am yours. This pretty way becomes ye. But you would deceive my sorrows; that's your intent. Amin. I would I could, I should not weep, but smile. Do ye like your Meat and Wine? Alb. Like it? Amin. Do you like your liberty? Alb. All these I well may like. Amin. Then pray like her that sent 'em. Doe ye like wealth, and most unequal'd beauty? Alb. Peace, indeed you'l make me angry. Amin. Would I were dead that aske it, Then ye might freely like, and I forgive ye. Alb. What like, and who? adde not more misery To a man that's fruitfull in afflictions. Who is't you would have me like? Who sent these comforts? Amin. I must tell. Alb. Be bold. Amin. But be you temperate. If you be bold I die. The young fair Virgin; (Sorrow hath made me old.) O hearken, And wisely harke, the Governesse daughter: That Star that strikes this Island full of wonder, That blooming sweetnesse. Alb. What of her? Amin. She sent it: and with it, It must be out, she dotes on ye, And must enjoy ye: else no joy must find ye. Alb. And have you the patience to deliver this? Amin. A sister may say much, and modestly. Alb. A Sister? Amin. Yes, that name undid ye; Undid us both: had ye nam'd wife, she had fear'd ye; And fear'd the sin she followed; She had shun'd, yea Her Virgin modesty had not touch'd at ye. But thinking you were free, hath kindled a fire, I feare will hardly be extinguisht. Alb. Indeed I played the foole. Amin. O my best sir, take heed, Take heed of lies. Truth though it trouble some minds, Some wicked minds, that are both darke and dangerous: Yet it preserves it selfe, comes off pure, innocent, And like the Sunne, though never so ecclips'd, Must breake in glory. O sir, lie no more. Alb. Ye have read me a faire Lecture, And put a spell upon my tongue for fayning. But how will you counsell now? Amin. Ye must study to forget me. Alb. How? Amin. Be patient. Be wise and patient, it concerns ye highly. Can ye lay by our loves? But why should I doubt it? Ye are a man, and men may shift affections, Tis held no fin. To come to the poynt, Ye must lose me; many and mighty reasons. Alb. Heare me Aminta, Have you a man that loves you to, that feeds ye, That sends ye liberty? has this great Governesse A noble sonne too, young, and apt to catch ye? Am I because I am in bonds, and miserable, My health decay'd, my youth, and strength halfe blasted, My fortune like my wayning selfe, for this despis'd? Am I for this forsaken? a new love chosen, And my affections, like my fortunes wanderers? Take heed of lying, you that chid me for it; And shew'd how deep a sin it was, and dangerous. Take heed, your selfe, you swore you lov'd me deerly; No few, nor little oathes you swore Aminta, Those seal'd with no small faith, I then assur'd my selfe. O seek no new waies to cozen truth. Amin. I do not. By Love it selfe I love thee, And ever must, nor can all deaths dissolve it. Alb. Why do you urge me thus then? Amin. For your safety, To preserve your life. Alb. My life I do confesse is hers, She gives it, And let her take it back, I yeild it. My loves intirely thine, none shall touch at it; None, my Aminta, none. Amin. Ye have made me happy, And now I know ye are mine. Fortune, I scorn thee. Go to your rest, and Ile sit by ye; Whilst I have time Ile be your mate, and comfort ye, For onely I am trusted: you shall want nothing, Not a liberty that I can steal ye. Alb. May we not celebrate our loves Aminta? And where our wishes cannot meet Amin. You are wanton, But with cold kisses Ile allay that feavor; Look for no more, and that in private too. Believe me I shall blush else. But let's consider, we are both lost else. Alb. Let's in, and prevent fate. Exeunt. Enter Crocale, Juletta, Tibalt, Master. Tib. You do well to ayre us Ladies, we shall be musty else. What are your wise wils now? Cro. You are very cranck still. Tib. As cranck as a holy Fryer, fed with hayl-stones. But do ye bring us out to baite, like Buls? Mast. Or are you weary of the charge ye are at? Turn us abroad again, let's jog Ladies; We are grosse, and course, unfit for your sweet pleasures. Tib. Knock off our shoos, and turn's to grasse. Cro. You are determined Still to be stubborn then: it well becomes ye. Tib. An humour Lady that contents a prisoner. A sullen fit sometimes serves for a second course. Jul. Ye may as well be kind, And gain our favours; gain meat, and drink, And lodging to rest your bones. Tib. My bones have bore me thus long, And had their share of pains, and recreations; If they fayl now, they are no fayr companions. Cro. Are ye thus harsh to all our sex? Mast. We cannot be merry without a Fidler. Pray strike up your Tabors, Ladies. Cro. The fools despise us. Jul. We know ye are very hungry now. Tib. Yes, tis very wholsome Ladies; For we that have grosse bodies, must be carefull. Have ye no piercing ayre to stir our stomacks? We are beholding to ye for our Ordinary. Jul. Why slaves, tis in our power to hang ye. Mast. Very likely. Tis in our powers then to be hang'd, and scorn ye. Hanging's as sweet to us, as dreaming to you. Cro. Come, be more courteous. Jul. Do, and then ye shal be pleas'd, and have all necessaries. Tib. Give me some Rats-bane then. Cro. And why Rats-bane, Mounsier? Tib. We live like vermin here, &amp; eate up your Cheese, Your mouldy Cheese, that none but Rats would bite at; Therefore tis just that Rats-bane should reward us. We are unprofitable, and our Ploughs are broken; There is no hope of Harvest this yeere, Ladies. Jul. Ye shall have all content. Mast. I, and we'l serve your uses. I had rather serve hogs, there's more delight in't Your greedy appetites are never satisfied; Just like hungry Camels, sleeping or waking You chew the cud still. Cro. By this hand we'l starve ye. Mast. Tis a Noble courtesie. I had as liefe ye should famish me, as founder me, To be jaded to death is onely fit for a hackney. Here be certain tarts of tar about me, And parcels of potargo in my Jerkin, As long as these last. Jul. Which will not last ever. Tib. Then we'l eate one another like good fellows, A shoulder of his for a hanch of mine. Jul. Tis excellent. Tib. Twill be, as we'l dresse it Ladies. Cro. Why sure ye are not men. Mast. Ye had best come search us, A Seaman is seldome without a salt Eele. Tib. I am bad enough, And in my nature a notorious wencher; And yet ye make me blush at your immodesty. Tell me good Master, didst ever see such things? Mast. I could like 'em though they were lewdly given, If they could say no; but fie on 'em, They gape like Oysters. Tib. Well, ye may hang, or starve us; But your commanding impudence shall never feare us. Had ye by blushing signs, soft cunnings, crept into us, And shew'd us your necessities: we had met your purposes, Supply'd your wants. We are no Saints Ladies; I love a good wench, as I love my life, And with my life I will maintain my love: But such a sordid impudence Ile spit at Let's to our dens again. Come noble Master. You know our minds Ladies: This is the faith in which we'l die. Exit Tib. and Mast. Cro. I doe admire 'em. Jul. They are noble fellows, And they shall not want, for this. Cro. But see, Clarinda comes. Enter Clarinda. Farewell, Ile to my charge. Cla. Bring out those prisoners now, And let me seee 'em, and heare their businesse. Jul. I will, Maddam. Exit. Cla. I hope she hath prevail'd upon her brother. She has a sweet tongue, and can describe the happinesse My love is ready to fling on him. And sure he must be glad, and certain wonder And blesse the houre that brought him to this Island. I long to heare the full joy that he labours with. Enter Juletta Morillat, Franvile, Lamure. Mor. Blesse thy Divine beauty. Fran. Mirror of sweetnesse. Lam. Ever springing brightnesse. Cla. Nay, stand up Gentlemen, and leave your flatteries. Mor. Shee cals us Gentlemen, sure we shall have some meat now. Cla. I am a mortall creature, Worship Heaven, and give these attributes To their Divinities. Methinks ye look but thin. Mor. O we are starv'd, immortall beauty. Lam. We are all poor starv'd knaves. Fran. Neither liberty nor meat Lady. Mor. We were handsome men, and Gentlemen, &amp; sweet men, And were once gracious in the eyes of beauties, But now we look like rogues; Like poore starv'd rogues. Cla. What would ye do if ye were to die now? Fran. Alas we were prepar'd. If you will hang us, Let's have a good meale or two to die with, To put's in heart. Mor. Or if you'l drown us, Let's be drunk first, that we may die merrily, And blesse the founders. Cla. Ye shal not die so hastily. What dare ye do to deserve my favour? Lam. Put us to any service. Fran. Any bondage, Let's but live. Mor. Wee'l get a world of children, For we know, ye are hainously provided that way; And ye shal beat us when we offend ye; Beat us abundantly, and take our meat from us. Cla. These are weak abject things, that shew ye poor ones: What's the great service ye so oft have threatned, If ye might see me, and win my favour? Jul. That businesse of discovery. Mor. O, Ile tell ye Lady. Lam. and so will I. Fran. And I, Pray let me speak first. Mor. Good, no confusion. We are before a Lady that knows manners; And by the next, meat I shall eate, tis certain. This little Gentlewoman that was taken with us Cla. Your Captains sister, she you mean. Mor. I, I, she's the businesse that we would open to ye. You are cousned in her. Lam.; Fran. How, what is't you would open? She is no sister. Mor. Good sirs, how quick you are. She is no sister, Madam. Fran. She is his. Mor. Peace I say. Cla. What is she? Mor. Faith, sweet Lady, She is, as a man would say, his. Cla. What? Lam. His Mistris. Mor. Or, as some new translators read, his. Cla. O me! Mor. And why he should delude you thus, Unlesse he meant some villany? these ten weeks He has had her at Sea for his own propes appetite. Lam. His Cabin-mate, Ile assure ye. Cla. No sister, say ye? Mor. No more then I am brother to your beauty. I know not why he should juggle thus. Cla. Do not lie to me. Mor. If ye find me lie, Lady, hang me empty. Cla. How am I fool'd! Away with 'em, Juletta, and feed 'em But hark ye, with such food as they have given me. New misery! Fran. Nor meat, nor thanks for all this. Exit. Cla. Make 'em more wretched. O I could burst! curse and kill now, Kill any thing I meet. Juletta, follow me, And call the rest along. Iul. We follow Maddam. Exeunt. Enter Albert and Aminta. Amin. I must be gone now, else she may suspect me; How shall I answer her? Alb. Tell her directly. Amin. That were too sudden, too improvident; Fires of this nature must be put out cunningly, They'l waste all come neare 'em else. Farewell once more. Alb. Farewell. And keep my love entire. Nay kisse me once again, me thinks we should not part. Amin. O be wise, sir. Alb. Nay, one kisse more. Amin. Indeed you'r wanton; Enter Clarinda, Juletta, Crolale, Hippolita. We may be taken too. Cla. Out thou base woman. By Heaven Ile shoot 'em both. Cro. Nay stay, brave Lady, hold; A sudden death cuts of a Nobler vengeance. Cla. Am I made Bawd to your lascivious meetings? Are ye grown so wise in sin? Shut up that villaine: and sirra, Now expect my utmost anger. Let him there starve. Alb. I, mock at your mischiefes. Exit. Cla. Tie that false witch unto that Tree, There let the savage beasts Gnaw of her sweetnesse, and Snakes Embrace her beauties; tie her, and watch That none relieve her. Hip. We could wish ye better fortune Lady, But dare not help ye. Amin. Be your own friends, I thank ye. Now onely my last audit, and my greatest, Enter Raymond. O Heaven, be kind unto me, And if it be thy wil, preserve. Raym. Who is this? Sure tis a woman; I have trod this place, And found much footing: now I know tis peopl'd. Ha, let me see! tis her face. O Heaven! turn this way mayd. Amin. O Raymond, O brother. Raym. Her tongue to: tis my sister; what rude hand! Nay kisse me first, O joy! Amin. Fly, fly deere brother, You are lost else. Jul. A man, a man, a new man. Raym. What are these? Enter Juletta, Crocale, Clarinda. Cro. An Enemy, an Enemy. Cla. Dispatch him, Take him off, shoot him straight. Raym. I dare not use my sword, Ladies, Against such comely foes. Amin. O brother brother! Cla. Away with 'em, and in darke prisons bind 'em. One word replyd, ye die both. Now brave mother follow thy Noble Anger, And Ile help thee. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quintus ScÃ¦na prima. Enteer Rossella, Clarinda, Crocale, Juletta, Hippolita. Ros. I am deaf to all your intreaties: she that moves me For pity or compassion to these Pirates, Digs up her fathers, or her brothers Tombe, And spurns about their ashes. Couldst thou remember what a father thou hast once, Twould steele thy heart against foolish pity. By his memory, and the remembrance of his deere embraces, I am taught, that in a Noble cause revenge is Noble; And they shal fall the sacrifices to appease His wandering Ghost, and my incensed fury. Cla. The new come prisoner to? Ros. Him to. Yet that we may learn Whether they are the same, or neere ally'd To those that forc'd me to this cruell course, Better their poore allowance, and permit 'em To meet together and confer, Within the distance of your eare; perhaps They may discover something that may kill Despaire in me, and be a means to save 'em From certain ruine. Cro. That shal be my charge. Ros. Yet to prevent All hope of rescue: for this new come Captain Hath both a ship and men not far off from us, Though ignorant to find the onely Port, That can yeeld entrance to our happy Island, Guard the place strongly, and ere the next Sunne Ends his diurnall progresse, I wil be Happy in my revenge, or set 'em free. Exeunt. Enter Crocale, Juletta, Hippolita. A Table furnisht. Cro. So serve it plentifully, And lose not time to enquire the cause; There is a main design that hangs upon this bounty. See the Table furnisht with Wine too, That discovers secrets which tortures cannot open: Open the doores too of the severall prisons, And give all free entrance into this room. Undiscover'd I can here marke all. Enter Tib. Mast. Here's Captain carelesse, and the tough Ship-master, The slaves are nos'd like Vultures How wilde they look. Tib. Ha, the mystery of this, Some good Hobgoblin rise and reveale. Mast. I am amazed at it: nor can I sound the intent. Tib. Is not this Bread, Substantiall bread, not painted? Mast. But take heed, You may be poysoned. Tib. I am sure I am famisht; And as the wise man says, Gripes the guts as much as any Minerall. This may be Treacle sent to preserve me After a long fast: or be it Vipers spittle, Ile run the hazzard. Mast. We are past all feare, Ile take part with ye. Tib. Do: and now yfaith, how d'e feel your selfe? I finde great ease in't. What's here? Wine, and it be thy will; Strong lusty Wine. Well, fooles may talke Of Metridate, Cordials, and Elixars. But from my youth this was my onely Physick. Here's a colour, what Ladies cheek, Though ceruss'd over, comes neere it? It sparkles too: hangs out Diamonds. O my sweet heart, how I will hug thee, Again, and again! They are poor drunkards, And not worth thy favours, That number thy moyst kisses in these Christals. Mast. But Mounsiuer, Here are Suckets, and sweet dishes. Tib. Tush, boys meat, I am past it; here's strong food fit for men: Nectar, old lad. Mistris of merry hearts, Once more I am bold with you. Mast. Take heed (man) Too much will breed distemper. Tib. Hast thou liv'd at Sea The most part of thy life, where to be sober While we have Wine aboord, is capital treason; And dost thou preach sobriety? Mast. prethee forbeare, We may offend in it; we know not for whom It was provided. Tib. I am sure for me: therefore footra, When I am full, let 'em hang me, I care not. Mast. This has been his temper ever. Enter Albert, Aminta, Raymond, Lamure, Morrillat, Franvile, severally. See, provoking dishes, candid Eringoes, And Potatoes. Tib. Ile not touch 'em, I will drink; But not a bit on a march, Ile be an Eunuch rather. Mast. Who are these? Tib. Marry, who you will; I keep my text here. Alb. Raymond! Raym. Albert! Tib. Away, Ile be drunke alone; Keep off rogues, or Ile belch ye into ayre; Not a drop here. Amin. Deere brother, put not in your eyes such anger; Those looks poyson'd with fury shot at him, Reflect on me. O brother looke milder, or The Christall of his temperance Will turn 'em on your selfe. Alb. Sir, I have sought ye long To finde your pardon: you have ploughed the Ocean To wreak your vengeance on me, for the rape Of this faire virgin. Now our fortune guides us To meet on such hard terms, that we need rather A mutuall pitty of our present state, Then to expostulate of breaches past, Which cannot be made up. And though it be Far from your power to force me to confesse, That I have done ye wrong, or such submission Failing to make my peace, to vent your anger; You being your selfe slav'd, as I to others: Yet for your sisters sake, her blessed sake, In part of recompence of what she has suffered For my rash folly; the contagion Of my black actions catching hold upon Her purer innocence: I crave your mercy, And wish however severall motives kept us From being friends while we had hope to live, Let death which we expect, and cannot fly from, End all contention. Tib. Drink upon't, 'tis a good motion; Ratifie it in Wine, and tis authenticall. Raym. When I consider The ground of our long difference, and look on Our not to be avoyded miseries, It doth beget in me I know not how A soft religious tendernesse; which tels me, Though we have many faults to answer for Upon our own account, our fathers crimes Are in us punisht. O Albert, the course They took to leave us rich was not honest, Nor can that friendship last, which vertue joyns not. When first they forc'd the industrious Portugals, From their Plantations in the happy Islands. Cro. This is that I watch for. Raym. And did omit no tyranny, which men Inured to spoyle and mischiefe could inflict, On the griev'd sufferers; when by lawlesse rapine They reapt the harvest, which their labours sowed; And not content to force 'em from their dwelling, But layd for 'em at Sea, to ravish from 'em The last remainder of their wealth; then, then, After a long pursuit, each doubting other, As guilty of the Portugals escape, They did begin to quarrell, like ill men; (Forgive me piety, that I call em so) No longer love, or correspondence holds, Then it is cimented with prey or profit: Then did they turn those Swords they oft had bloodied With innocent gore, upon their wretched selves, And payd the forfeit of their cruelty Shown to Sebastian, and his Collonie, By being fatall Enemies to each other. Thence grew Amintas rape, and my desire To be reveng'd. And now observe the issue: As they for spoyle ever forgot compassion To women, (who should be exempted From the extremities of a lawfull war) We now, young able men, are faln into The hands of women; that, against the soft Tendernesse familiar to their sex, Enter Crocale. Will shew no mercy. Cro. None, unlesse you shew us Our long lost husbands. We are those Potugals you talk'd of. Raym. Stay, I met upon the Sea in a tall ship Two Portugals, famisht almost to death. Tib. Our ship by this Wine. And those the rogues that stole her, Left us to famish in the barraine Islands. Ray. Some such tale they told me, And something of a woman, which I find, To be my sister. Cro. Where are these men? Ray. I left 'em, Supposing they had deluded me with forg'd tales, In the Island where they sayd They had liv'd many years the wretched owners Of a huge masse of treasure. Alb. The same men: and that the fatall muck We quarreld for. Cro. They were Portugals you say. Ray. So they profess'd. Cro. They may prove such men as may save your lives, And so much I am taken with faire hope, That I will hazard life to be resolv'd on't: How came you hither? Ray. My ship lies by the rivers mouth, That can convey yee to these wretched men, Which you desire to see. Cro. Back to your prisons, And pray for the successe: if they be those Which I desire to finde, you are safe; If not, prepare to die to morrow: For the world cannot redeem ye. Alb. How ever, we are armd For either fortune. Exit. Ti. What must become of me now That I am not dismis'd? Cro. O sir, I purpose To have your company. Ti. Take heed wicked woman, I am apt to mischiefe now. Cro. You cannot be so unkind, To her that gives you liberty. Ti. No, I shall be too kind, thats the devil on't; I have had store of good wine: and when I am drunk, Joane is a Lady to me, and I shall Lay about me like a Lord: I feele strange motions: Avoid me temptation. Cro. Come sir, i'le help yee in. Exeunt. Enter Sebastian, and Nicusa. Nicu. VVhat may that be That mooves upon the Lake? Seba. Still it drawes neerer, And now I plainly can descerne it. Tis the French ship. Nicu. In it a woman, VVho seemes to invite us to her, Seba. Still she cals with signes of Love to hasten to her; So lovely hope doth still appeare: I feele nor age nor weaknesse. Nicu. Though it bring death, To us tis comfort: and deserves a meeting. Or els fortune tyrd with what we have suffer'd, And in it overcome, as it may be, Now sets a period to our misery. Exeunt. Enter severally, Raymond, Albert, Aminta. horrid Musicke. Ray. What dreadfull sounds are these? Amin. Infernall Musick, Fit for a bloody Feast. Alb. It seemes prepar'd To kill our courages, e're they divorse Our soules and bodies. Ray. But they that fearelesse fall, Deprive them of their triumph. An alter prepar'd. Enter Rossillia, Clarinda, Iulletta, Hippollitta, &amp;c. Aminta. See the furies, In their full Trym of cruelty. Ros. Tis the last Duty that I can pay to my dead Lord, Set out the Altar, I my selfe wilbe The Priest, and boldly do those horrid Rites You shake to think on: lead these Captaines neerer, For they shall have the honour to fall first To my Sebastians ashes: and now wretches, As I am taught already that you are, And lately by your free confession, French pirats, and the sons of those I hate, Even equall with the devil; here with horror, What tis invites me to this cruell course, And what you are to suffer; no Amazons we, But women of Portugall, that must have from you Sebastian and Nicusa; we are they That groan'd beneath your fathers wrongs: VVe are those wretched women, Their injuries pursu'd, and overtook; And from the sad remembrance of our losses We are taught to be cruell; when we were forc'd From that sweet ayre we breathed in, by their rapine, And sought a place of being; as the Seas And winds conspird with their ill purposses, To load us with afflictions, in a storme That fell upon us; the two ships that brought us, To seek new fortunes in an unknown world Were severed: the one bore all the able men, Our treasure and our Jewels: in the other, We women were imbarq'd: and fell upon, After long tossing in the troubled maine, This pleasant Island: But in few moneths, The men that did conduct us hither died, We long before had given our husbands lost: Remembring what we had suffred by the French, We took a solemn Oath never to admit The curs'd society of men: necessity Taught us those arts not usuall to our sex: And the fertile Earth yeelding abundance to us, We did resolve thus shapt like Amazons To end our lives; but when you ariv'd here, And brought as presents to us our own Jewels; Those which were boorn in the other ship, How can ye hope to scape our vengeance? Amin. It boots not then to swear our innocence? Alb. Or that we never forc'd it from the owners? Ray. Or that there are a remnant of that wrack, And not far off? Ros. All you affirme, I know, Is but to win time; therefore prepare your throats, The world shall not redeem ye: and that your cries May find no entrance to our eares, To moove pitty in any: bid lowd Musick sound Their fatall Knels; if ye have prayers use 'em quickly, To any power will own yea; but ha! Enter Crocale, Sebastian, Nicusa, Tibalt. Cro. Who are these? what spectacles of misfortun? Why are their looks So full of Joy and wonder? Cro. Oh! lay by These instruments of death, and welcome To your armes what you durst never hope to imbrace: This is Sebastian, this Nicusa Maddam: Preserv'd by miracle: look up deer sir, And know your own Rossellia: be not lost In wonder and amazment; or if nature Can by instinct instruct you what it is, To be blessed with the name of Father, Freely injoy it in this faire Virgin. Seba. Though my miseries, And many years of wants, I have indur'd, May well deprave me of the memory Of all joyes past; yet looking on this building, This ruind building of a heavenly forme In my Rossella; I must remember, I am Sebastian. Ros. O my joyes! Seba. And here, I see a perfect modell of thy selfe, As thou wert when thy choyce first made thee mine: These cheecks and fronts though wrinkled now with time Which art cannot restore: had equall purenesse, Of naturall white and red, and as much ravishing: Which by fayre order and succession, I see descend on her: and may thy vertues Winde into her forme, and make her a perfect dower: No part of thy sweet goodnesse wanting to her. I will not now Rossellia aske thy fortunes, Nor trouble thee with hearing mine; Those shall hereafter serve to make glad howers In their relation: All past wrongs forgot; I am glad to see you Gentlemen; but most, That it is in my power to save your Lives; You sav'd ours when we were neer starv'd at Sea, And I despaire not, for if she be mine? Rossellia can deny Sebastian nothing. Ros. She do's give up her selfe, Her power and joyes, and all, to you, To be discharged of 'em as to burthensome; Wellcome in any shape. Sebast. Sir in your looks, I read your sute of my Clarinda: she is yours: And Lady if it be in me to confirme Your hopes in this brave Gentleman, Presume I am your servant. Alb. We thanke you sir. Amin. O Happy houre! Alb. O my deer Aminta; Now all our feares are ended. Tib. Here I fix: she's mettle, Steele to the back: and will cut my leaden dagger, If not us'd with discretion. Cro. You are still no changling. Sebast. Nay, All look cheerfully, for none shalbe Denyd their lawfull wishes; when a while We have here refresht our selves; wee'l returne To our severall homes; and well that voyage ends, That makes of deady enemies faythfull friends. Exeunt FINIS.</field>
