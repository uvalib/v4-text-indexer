      <field name="fulltext">CHOËPHORI OR THE LIBATION-POURERS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ARGUMENT. It came to pass, after Agamemnon had been slain, that Clytæmnestra and Ægisthos ruled in Argos, and all things seemed to go well with them. Orestes, who was heir to Agamemnon, they had sent away to the care of Strophios of Phokis, and there he abode. Electra, his sister, mourned in secret over her father's death, and prayed for vengeance, but no avenger came. And when Orestes grew up to man's estate, he went to ask counsel of the God at Delphi, and the God straitly charged him to take vengeance on his father's murderers; and so he started on his journey with his trusty friend Pylades, and arrived at Argos. And it chanced that a little while before he came, the Gods sent Clytæmnestra a fearful dream, that troubled her soul greatly; and in her terror she bade Electra go with her handmaids to pour libations on the tomb of Agamemnon, that so she might appease his soul, and propitiate the Powers that rule over the dark world of the dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis Personæ. Orestes. Electra. Clytæmnestra. Ægisthos. Pylades. Nurse. Servant. Chorus of Captive Women.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE.—Argos, in front of the palace of the Atreidæ. The tomb of Agamemnon (a raised mound of earth) is seen in the background. [Enter Orestes and Pylades from the left; Orestes advances to the mound, and, as he speaks, lays on it a lock of his hair. Orest. O Hermes, of the darkness 'neath the earth, Who hast the charge of all thy Father's Hermes is invoked, (1,) as the watcher over the souls of the dead in Hades, and therefore the natural patron of the murdered Agamemnon; (2,) as exercising an authority delegated by Zeus, and therefore capable of being, like Zeus himself, the deliverer and helper of suppliants. So Electra, further on, invokes Hermes in the same character. The line may, however, be rendered, “Who stand'st as guardian of my father's house.” The three opening lines are noticeable, as having been chosen by Aristophanes as the special object for his satirical criticism (Frogs., 1126–1176,) abounding in a good score of ambiguities and tautologies. sway, To me who pray deliverer, helper be; For I to this land come, from exile come, And on the raised mound of this monument I bid my father hear and list. One tress, Thank-offering for the gifts that fed my youth, To Inachos I consecrate, and this The second, as the token of my grief; The words point to the two symbolic aspects of one and the same practice. In both there are some points of analogy with the earlier and later forms of the Nazarite vow among the Jews. (1.) As being part of the body, and yet separable from it without mutilation, it became the representative of the whole man, and as such was the sign of a votive dedication. As early as Homer, it was the custom for youths to keep one long, flowing lock as consecrated, and when they reached manhood, they cut it off, and offered it to the river-god of their country, throwing it into the stream, as that to which, directly and indirectly, they owed their nurture. Here the offering is made to Inachos, as the hero-founder of Argos, identified with the river that bore his name. (2.) They shaved their head, wholly or in part, as a token of grief, and then, because true grief for the dead was an acceptable and propitiatory offering, this became the natural offering for suppliants who offered their prayers at the tombs of the departed. So in the Aias of Sophocles (v. 1174) Teucros calls on Eurysakes to approach the corpse of his father, holding in his hands locks of his own hair, his mother's, and that of Teucros. In the offering which Achilles makes over the grave of Patroclos of the hair which he had cherished for the river-God of his fatherland, Spercheios, we have the union of the two customs. Homer, Il. xxiii. 141–151. For mine it was not, father, being by, Over thy death to groan, nor yet to stretch My hand forth for the burial of thy corpse. [As he speaks, Electra, followed by a train of captive women in black garments bearing libations, wailing and tearing their clothes, comes forth from the palace. What see I now? And what this company Of women seen advancing in dark robes? What chance shall I conjecture as its cause? Does a new sorrow fall upon this house? Or am I right in guessing that they bring Libations to my father, soothing gifts To those beneath? It is nought else but this; E'en so, I deem, Electra comes in sight, By wailing grief conspicuous. Thou, O Zeus, Grant me full vengeance for my father's death, And of thine own good will my helper be! Come, Pylades, and let us stand aside, That I may clearly learn what means this train Of women offering prayers. Chorus. Stroph. I. Sent from the house I come, With quick, sharp beatings of the hands in grief, To pour libations here; And see, my cheeks with bloody marks are tracked, After the widespread fashion of the East, the handmaids of Clytæmnestra (originally Troïan captives) had to rend their clothes, beat their breasts, and lacerate their faces till the blood came. The higher civilisation of Solon's laws had forbidden these wild, barbarous forms of grief at Athens. Plutarch, Solon, p. 164. The new-cut furrows which my nails have made, And evermore my heart is fed with groans; And folds of mantles tied Across the breast are rent To shreds and rags in grief, Marring the grace of linen mantles fair, Of those struck down by woes that shut out smiles. Antistroph. I. Full clear a spectre came That made each single hair to stand on end, Dream-prophet of this house, That in our sleep breathes out avenging wrath; And from the secret chamber cried in fear A cry that broke the silence of the night, There, where the women dwell, Falling with heaviest weight; And those who judge these dreams Told, calling God to witness, that the souls Below were wroth and vexed with those that slew. Stroph. II. On such a graceless deed of grace, as charm To ward off ill, (O Earth! O mother kind!) A godless woman now Sends me with eager heart; And yet I dread to utter that same prayer; What ransom has been found For blood on earth once poured? Oh! hearth all miserable! Oh! utter overthrow of house and home! Yea, mists of darkness, sunless, loathed of men, Cover both home and house With its lords' bloody deaths. Antistroph. II. Yea, all the majesty that awed of old, Unchecked, unconquered, irresistible, Thrilling the people's heart As well as ears, is gone; And there are those that fear; Purposely, perhaps, obscure. They seem to say that the old reverence for Agamemnon has passed away, and instead of it there is only a slavish fear for Ægisthos. For the more acute, however, they imply that those who have cause to fear are Ægisthos and Clytæmnestra themselves. and now Success Is man's sole God and more; But stroke of vengeance swift Smites some in life's clear day, And for some tarrying long their sorrows wait In twilight dim, on darkness' borderland, And some the gloom of night, Where nought is done, holds fast. Stroph. III. Because of blood that mother Earth has drunk, The guilt of slaughter that will vengeance work Is fixed indelibly; And Até, working grief, Permits awhile the guilty one to wait, That so he may be full and overflow With all-devouring ill. Antistroph. III. No remedy avails for him whose touch The words, in their generalising sententiousness, refer specially to the twofold crime of Ægisthos as an adulterer and murderer. Then, in the Epode, the Chorus justify themselves for their seeming inconsistency in thus abhorring the guilt, and yet acting as instruments of the guilty in their attempts to escape punishment. Comes on the bridal bed; and water-streams, Though all in common course Should flow to cleanse the guilt Of murder that the sin-stained hand defiles, Would yet flow all in vain That guilt to purify. Epode. But now to me, since the high Gods have sent A doom of bondage round my city's walls, (For from my father's home They have brought on me doom of slavery,) Deeds right and wrong alike Have been as things 'twas meet I should accept, Since this slave-life began, Where deeds are done by violence and force,— And I must needs suppress The bitter loathing of my inmost heart, And now beneath my cloak I weep and wail For all the frustrate fortunes of my lords, Chilled through with secret grief. Elect. Ye handmaids, ye who deftly tend this house, Since ye are here companions in my task As suppliants, give me your advice in this, What shall I say as these funereal gifts I pour? How shall I speak acceptably? How to my father pray? What? Shall I say, “I bring from loving wife to husband loved Gifts”—from my mother? No, I am not bold Enough for that, nor know I what to speak, Pouring this chrism on my father's tomb, A mixture of meal, honey, and oil formed the half-liquid substance commonly used for these funereal libations. The “garlands” may be wreaths of flowers or fillets, or the word may be used figuratively for the libation itself, as crowning the mound in which Agamemnon lay. Or shall I say this prayer, as men are wont, “Good recompense make thou to those who bring These garlands,” yea, a gift full well deserved By deeds of ill? Or dumb, with ignominy Like that with which he perished, shall I pour Libations on the earth, and like a man That flings away the lustral filth, shall I Throw down the urn and walk with eyes not turned? The words point to a strange Athenian custom. When a house was cleansed of that which defiled it, morally or physically, the filth was carried in an earthen vessel to a place where three ways met, and the worshipper flung the vessel behind him, and walked away without turning to look at it. To Electra's mind, the libation which her mother sends is equally unclean, and should be treated in the same way. So in Hom. Il., I. 314, the Argives purify themselves, and then cast the lustral water they have used into the sea. Lev. vi. 11, gives us an analogous usage. Comp. also Theocritos, Idyll, xxiv., vv. 92–97. Be sharers in my counsels, O my friends; A common hate we cherish in the house; Hide nothing in your heart through fear of man. Fate's doom decreed awaits alike the free, And those in bondage to another's hand. Speak, if thou know'st aught worthier than this. Chor. Thy father's tomb as altar honouring, I, as thou bidd'st, will speak my heart-thoughts out! Elect. Speak then, as thou my father's tomb dost honour. Chor. Say, as thou pour'st, good words for those that love. Elect. Which of my friends shall I address as such? Chor. First then thyself, and whoso hates Ægisthos. Elect. Shall I for thee, as for myself, pray thus? Chor. Now that thou'rt learning, judge of that thyself. Elect. Whom shall I add then to this company? Chor. Though far Orestes be, forget him not. Elect. Right well is this: thou teachest admirably. Chor. Then, mentioning those who did the deed of blood. ... Elect. What then? Dictate, and teach my ignorance. Partly it is the youth of Electra that seeks counsel from those who have had more experience; partly she shrinks from the responsibility of being the first to utter the formula of execration. Chor. That there may come to them some God or man. ... Elect. Shall I “as judge” or “as avenger” say? Chor. Say it out plain! “to give them death for death.”. ... Elect. And is it right to ask the Gods such things? Chor. Why not,—a foe with evils to requite? Elect. O mightiest herald of the Gods on high And those below, O Hermes of the dark, Call thou the Powers beneath, and bid them hear The prayers that look towards my father's house; And Earth herself, who all things bringeth forth, And rears them and again receives their fruit. And I to human souls libations pouring, Say, calling on my father, “Pity me; How shall we bring our dear Orestes home?” For now as sold to ill by her who bore us, We poor ones wander. She as husband gained Ægisthos, who was partner in thy death; And I am as a slave, and from his wealth Orestes now is banished, and they wax Full haughty in the wealth thy toil had wrought. And that Orestes hither with good luck May come, I pray. Hear thou that prayer, my father! And to myself grant thou that I may be Than that my mother wiser far of heart, Holier in act. For us this prayer I pour; And for our foes, my father, this I pray, That Justice may as thine avenger come, And that thy murderers perish. Thus I place Midway in prayer for good that now I speak, My prayer 'gainst them for evil. Be thou then The escort The word “escort” has a special reference to the function of Hermes in the unseen world. As he was wont to act as guide to the souls of the dead in their downward journey, so now Electra prays that he may lead the blessings she asks for upward from the dark depths of Earth. of these good things that I ask, With help of Gods, and Earth, and conquering Justice. With prayers like these my votive gifts I pour; [And as for you 'tis meet with cries to crown The pæan ye utter, wailing for the dead.] Chorus. Strophe. Pour ye the pattering tear, Falling for fallen lord, Here by the tomb that shuts out good and ill,— Here, where the full libations have been poured That turn aside the curse men deprecrate, Hear me, O Thou my Dread, Hear thou, O Sire, the words my dark mind speaks! Antistrophe. Oh, woe is me, woe, woe! Woe, woe, and woe is me! What warrior strong of spear Shall come the house to free, Or Ares with his Skythian bow The Skythian bow, long and elastic, bending either way, like those of the Arabians, (Herod. vii. 69.) The connexion of Ares with the wild, fierce tribes of Thrakia and Skythia meets us again and again in the literature of Greece. He was the only God to whom they built temples, (Ibid., iv. 59.) They sacrificed human victims to an iron sword as his more appropriate symbol, (iv. 62.) The use of iron for weapons of war came to the Greeks from them, (Seven ag. Th. 729, Prom. 714.) in hand, Shaking its pliant strength in deeds of war, Or guiding in encounter closer yet The weapons made with hilts? [During the choral ode Electra goes to the mound, pours the libations on it, and returns holding in her hands the lock of hair which Orestes had left there. Elect. The gifts the earth hath drunk, my father hath them: Now this new story come and share with me. Chor. Speak on, my heart goes pit-a-pat with fear. Elect. There on the tomb I see this lock cut off. Chor. What man or maid low-girdled can it claim? Elect. Full easy this for any one to guess. Chor. Old as I am, may I from younger learn? Elect. None but myself could cut off lock like this. Chor. Yea, foes are they that should with grief-locks mourn. Elect. Yes, surely, 'tis indeed the self same hair. ... Chor. But as what tresses? This I seek to know. Elect. And he in truth is very like to me. ... Chor. Does then Orestes send this secret gift? It may be worth while to compare the methods adopted by the three dramatists of Greece in bringing about the recognition of the brother by the sister. (1.) Here the lock of hair in its peculiar colour and texture, resembling her own, followed by the likeness of his footsteps to hers, prepares the way first for vague anticipations, and then the robe she had made for him, leads to her acceptance of Orestes on his own discovery of himself. To this it has been objected, by Euripides in the first instance, (Electra, vv. 462–500), that the evidence of the colour of the hair is weak, that a young man's foot must have been larger than a maiden's, and that he could not have worn as a man the garment she had made for him as a child. It might be replied, perhaps, that there are such things as hereditary resemblances extending to the colour of the hair and the arch of the instep, and that the robe may either have been shown instead of worn, or, being worn, have been adapted for the larger growth. (2.) In the Electra of Sophocles the lock of hair alone convinces Chrysothemis that her brother is near at hand, (v. 900,) while Electra herself requires the further evidence of Agamemnon's seal, (v. 1223.) In Euripides, (v. 527,) all proofs fail till Orestes shows a scar on his brow, which his sister remembers. Elect. It is most like those flowing locks of his. Chor. How had he dared adventure to come hither? Elect. He sent the lock shorn off as filial gift. Chor. Not less regretful than before, thy words, If on this soil his foot shall never tread. Elect. Yea, on me too there rushed heart-surge of gall; And I was smitten as with dart that pierced; And from mine eyes there fall the thirsty drops That pour unchecked, of this full bitter flood, As I this lock behold. How can I think That any other townsman owns this hair? Nay, she who slew ... she did not cut it off, My mother ... who towards her children shows A godless mood that little suits the name; And yet that I should this assert outright, The precious gift is his whom most of men I love, Orestes. ... Nay, hope flatters me. Alas! Alas! Would, herald-like, it had a kindly voice! So should I not turn to and fro in doubt; But either it had told me with all clearness To loathe this tress, if cut from hated head; Or, being of kin, had sought to share my grief, To deck the tomb and do my father honour. Chor. Well, on the Gods we call, on those who know In what storms we, like sailors, now are tossed: But if deliverance may indeed be ours, From a small seed a mighty trunk may grow. The saying is probably one of the wide-spread proverbs which imply parables. The idea is obviously that with which we are familiar in the Gospel, “grain of mustard seed.” Here, as in the “kicking against the pricks” of Acts ix. 5, xxvi. 14, and Agam. v. 1604, we are carried back to a period which lies beyond the range of history as that in which men took note of the analogies and embodied them in forms like this. Elect. Here too are foot-prints as a second proof, Just like ... yes, close resembling those of mine. For here are outlines of two separate feet, His own and those of fellow-traveller, And all the heels and impress of the feet, When measured, fit well with my footsteps here. ... Pangs come on me, and sore bewilderment. [As she ceases speaking Orestes comes forward from his concealment. Orest. Pray, uttering to the Gods no fruitless prayer, For good success in what is yet to come. Elect. What profits now to me the Gods' good will? Orest. Thou see'st those here whom most thou did'st desire. Elect. Whom called I on, that thou hast knowledge of? Orest. Right well I know how thou dost prize Orestes. Elect. In what then find I now my prayers fulfilled? Orest. Behold me! Seek no dearer friend than I! Elect. Nay, stranger, dost thou weave a snare for me? Orest. Then do I plot my schemes against myself. Elect. Thou seekest to make merry with my grief. Orest. With mine then also, if at all with thine. Elect. Art thou indeed Orestes that I speak to? Orest. Though thou see'st him, thou'rt slow to learn 'tis I; Yet when thou saw'st this lock of mourner's hair, And did'st the foot-prints track my feet had made, Agreeing with thine own, as brother's true, Then did'st thou deem in hope thou look'dst on me. Fit then this lock where it was cut, and see; See too this woven robe, thine own hands' work, The shuttle's stroke, and forms of beasts So in the Odyssey, (xix. 228,) Odysseus appears as wearing a woollen cloak, on which are embroidered the figures of a fawn and a dog. of chase. [Electra starts, as if about to cry aloud for joy.] Restrain thyself, nor lose thy head for joy: Our dearest kin, I know, are foes to us. Elect. [embracing Orestes] Thou whom thy father's house most loves, most prays for, Our one sole hope, bewept with many a tear, Of issue that shall work deliverance! Thine own might trusting, thou thy father's house Shalt soon win back. O pleasant fourfold name! I needs must speak to thee as father dear; An obvious reproduction of the words of Andromache, (Il. vi. 429.) The love I owe my mother turns to thee, (She with full right to me is hateful now,) My sister's too, who ruthlessly was slain; And thou wast ever faithful brother found In fullest reverence. Now may Might and Right, And sovran Zeus as third, my helpers be! Orest. Zeus! Zeus! be Thou a witness of our troubles, See the lorn brood that calls an eagle sire, Eagle that perished in the coils and folds Of a fell viper, and on them bereaved Presses gaunt famine. Not as yet full-grown Are they to bring their father's booty home. Thus it is thine to see in me and her, (I mean Electra) children fatherless, Both suffering the same exile from our home. Elect. And should'st Thou havoc make of brood of sire Who at thine altar greatly honoured Thee, Whence wilt Thou get a festive offering From hand as free? nor, should'st Thou bring to nought The eagle's nestlings, would'st Thou have at hand A messenger to bear thy will to man In signs persuasive. Nor, when withered up This royal stock shall be, will it again Wait on thine altars at high festivals: Oh, bring it back, and then Thou too wilt raise From low estate a lofty house, which now Seems to have fallen, fallen utterly. Chor. Ah, children! saviours of your father's house, Hush, hush, lest some one hear you, children dear, And for mere talking's sake report all this To those that rule. Ah, would I might behold them Lie dead 'midst oozing fir-pyre blazing high! The words seem to imply that burning alive was known among the Greeks as a punishment for the more atrocious crimes. The “oozing pitch” apparently describes something like the “tunica molesta” of Juvenal. (Sat. viii. 235.) Hesychios (s. v. ???????) mentions the practice as alluded to in a lost play of Æschylos. Orest. Nay, nay, I tell you, Loxias' oracle, In strength excelling, will not fail us now, That with clear voice spake often, warning me Of chilling pain-throes at the fevered heart, Unless my father's murderers I should chase, Bidding me kill them in the self-same fashion, Stirred by the wrongs that pauperise my life, And said that I with many a mischief ill Should pay for that fault with mine own dear life. For making known to men the charms earth-born That soothe the wrathful Powers, The words are both doubtful and obscure. Taking the reading which I have adopted, they seem to mean that while men in general had means of propitiating the Erinnyes and other Powers for the guilt of unavenged bloodshed, Orestes and Electra had no such way of escape open to them. If they, the next of kin, failed to do their work, these would be exposed to the full storm of wrath. But a conjectural emendation of one word gives us, “For making known to men the earth-born ills That come from wrathful Powers.” he spake for us Of woes as follows, leprous sores that creep All o'er the flesh, and as with cruel jaws Eat out its ancient nature, and white hairs Either that old age would come prematurely, or that the hair itself would share the leprous whiteness of the flesh. On that foul ill to supervene: and still He spake of other onsets of the Erinnyes, As brought to issue from a father's blood; For the dark weapon of the Gods below Winged by our kindred that lie low in death, And beg for vengeance, yea, and madness too, And vague, dim fears at night disturb and haunt me, Seeing full clearly, though I move my brow By some editors this verse is placed after v. 276, and the lines then read thus:— “And that he calls fresh onsets of the Erinnyes As brought to issue from a father's blood, Seeing clearly, though he move his brow in darkness” In the thick darkness ... and that then my frame, Thus tortured, should be driven from the city With brass-knobbed scourge: and that for such as I It was not given to share the wine-cup's taste, Nor votive stream in pure libation poured; And that my father's wrath invisible Would drive me from all altars, and that none Should take me in, or lodge with me; at last, That, loathed of all and friendless, I should die, A wretched mummy, all my strength consumed. Must I not trust such oracles as these? Though I trust not, the deed must yet be done; For many motives now in one converge,— The God's command, great sorrow for my father; My lack of fortune, this, too, urges me Never to leave our noble citizens, With glorious courage Troïa's conquerors, To be the subjects to two women thus; Yea, his soul is as woman's: Stress is laid here, as in Agam. 1224, on the effeminacy of the adulterer. an' it be not, He soon shall know the issue. Chor. Grant ye from Zeus, O mighty Destinies? That so our work may end As Justice wills, who takes our side at last; Now for the tongue of bitter hate let tongue Of bitter hate be given. Loud and long The voice of Justice claiming now her debt; And for the murderous blow Let him who slew with murderous blow repay. “That the wrong-doer bear the wrong he did,” Thrice-ancient saying of a far-off time, The great law of retribution is repeated from Agam. 1564. As one of the earliest utterances of man's moral sense, it was referred popularly among the Greeks to Rhadamanthos, who with Minos judged the souls of the dead in Hades. Comp. Aristot. Ethic. Nicom., v. 8. This speaketh as we speak. Stroph. I. Orest. O father, sire ill-starred, What deed or word could I Waft from afar to thee, Where thy couch holds thee now, To be a light with dark commensurate? Alike, in either case, The wail that tells their praise is welcome gift To those Atreidæ, guardians of our house. Stroph. II. Chor. My child, my child, the mighty jaws of fire The funeral pyre, which consumes the body, leaves the life and power of the man untouched. The spirit survives, and calls on the Gods that dwell in darkness to avenge him. The very cry of wailing tends, as a prayer to them, to the exposure of the murderer. Bind not the mood and spirit of the dead; But e'en when that is past he shows his wrath. When he that dies is wailed, The murderer stands revealed: The righteous cry for parents that begat, To fullest utterance roused, Searches the whole truth out. Antistroph. I. Elect. Hear then, O father, now Our tearful griefs in turn; From us thy children twain The funeral wail ascends; And we, as suppliants and as exiles too, Find shelter at thy tomb. What of all this is good, what void of ills? Is not this now a woe invincible? Chor. Yet, even yet, from evils such as these, God, if He will, may bring more pleasant strains; And for the dirge we utter by the tomb, A pæan in the royal house may raise, Welcome to new-found friend. Stroph. III. Orest. Had'st thou beneath the walls Of Ilion, O my sire, Been slain by Lykian foe, The Lykians, of whom Glaucos and Sarpedon are the representative heroes in the Iliad, are named as the chief allies of the Troïans. Pierced through and through with spear, Leaving high fame at home, And laying strong and sure Thy children's paths in life, Then had'st thou had as thine Far off across the sea A mound of earth heaped high, To all thy kith and kin endurable. Antistroph. II. Chor. Yea, and as friend with friends That nobly died, he then Had dwelt in high estate A sovereign ruler, held Of all in reverence, High in their train who rule Supreme in that dark world; For he, too, while he lived, As monarch ruled o'er those Whose hands the sceptre held That mortal men obey. The words embody the wide-spread feeling that the absence of funereal honours affected the spirit of the dead, and that the souls with whom he dwelt held him in high or low esteem according as they had been given or withheld. Antistroph. III. Elect. Not even 'neath the walls Of Troïa, O my Father, With those the spear hath slain, Would I have had thee lie By fair Scamandros' stream: No, this my prayer shall be That those who slew thee fall, By dearest friends struck down, That one might hear far off, Untried by woes like this, The fate that brings inevitable death. Chor. Of blessings more than golden, O my child, Greater than greatest fortune, or the bliss Of those beyond the North Pindar, (Pyth. x. 47,) the contemporary of Æschylos, had made the name of these Hyperborei well known to all Greeks. The vague dreams of men, before the earth had been searched out, pictured a happy land as lying beyond their reach. There were Islands of the Blest in the far West; Æthiopians, peaceful and long-lived, in the South; and far away, beyond the cold North, a people exempt from the common evils of humanity. The latter have been connected with the old Aryan belief in the paradise of Mount Meru. Comp. also Herod. iv. 421, Prom. 812. thou speakest now; For this is in thy power; But hold; e'en now this thud of double scourge Sc., the beating of both hands upon the breast. Finds its way on to him; Already these find helpers 'neath the earth, But of those rulers whom we loathe and hate Unholy are the hands: And children gain the day. Stroph. IV. Elect. Ah! this, like arrow, pierces through the ear! O Zeus! O Zeus! who sendest from below A woe of tardy doom Upon the bold and subtle hands of men. ... Nay, though they parents be, Yet all shall be fulfilled. Stroph. V. Chor. May it be mine to chant o'er funeral pyre Cry well accordant with the pine-fed blaze, Perhaps, simply “the sharp and bitter cry.” But the rendering in the text seems justified as repeating the wish already expressed (v. 260) that the murderers may die by this form of death. When first the man is slain, And his wife perisheth! Why should I hide what flutters round my heart? On my heart's prow a blast blows mightily, Keen wrath and loathing fierce. Antistroph. IV. Orest. And when shall Zeus, the orphan's guardian true, Lay to his hand and smite the guilty heads? So may our land learn faith! Vengeance I claim from those who did the wrong. Hear me, O Earth, and ye, Powers held in awe below! Chor. Yes, it is meet that gory drops once shed Upon the ground for yet more blood should crave; For lo! Erinnys loud on Havoc calls, To join the woe of those that fell of old, Which on one sorrow yet another brings. Stroph. VI. Elect. Ah, ah, O Earth, and Lords of those below! Behold, ye mighty Curses of the slain, Behold the remnant of the Atreidæ's house Brought to extremest strait, Bereaved of house and home! Whither, O Zeus, can any turn for help? Antistroph. V. Chor. Ah, my fond heart is quivering in dismay, Hearing this wailing cry of bitter grief: Now have I little cheer, And blackened is my heart, Hearing that speech; but then again when hope On strength uplifts me, far it drives my grief, Appearing full of grace. Antistroph. VI. Orest. What could we speak more fitly than the woes We suffer, yes, and from a parent's hands? Well, she may fawn; our mood remains unsoothed; For like a wolf untamed, We from our mother take A wrathful soul that to no fawning yields. Stroph. VII. Chor. I strike an Arian stroke, and in the strain Of Kissian mourner skilled, By some critics this speech and Antistroph. VII. are assigned to Electra, Antistroph. VIII. to the Chorus, with a corresponding change in the pronouns “my” and “thy.” The Chorus, as consisting of Troïan captives, is represented as adopting the more vehement Asiatic forms of wailing. Among these the Arians, Kissians, and Mariandynians (Pers., 920) seem to have been most conspicuous for their skill in lamentation, and as such were in request where hired mourners were wanted. Compare the opening chorus, v. 22. Ye might have seen the stretching forth of hands, With rendings of the hair, and random blows, In quick succession given, Dealt from above with arm at fullest length, And with the beating still my head is stunned, Battered and full of woe. Elect. O mother, hostile found, and daring all! With burial as of foe Thou had'st the heart a ruler to inter, His citizens not there, A spouse unwept, with no lamentings loud. Stroph. VIII. Orest. Ah! thou hast told the whole full tale of shame; Shall she not pay then for that outrage dire Unto my father done, So far as Gods prevail, So far as my hands work? May it be mine to smite her and then die! Antistroph. VII. Chor. Yea, he was maimed! The practice of mutilating the corpse of a murdered man by cutting off his hands and feet and fastening them round his waist, seems to have been looked on as rendering him powerless to seek for vengeance. Comp. Soph. Elect., v. 437. This kind of mutilation, and not mere wanton outrage, is what the Chorus here refer to. (that thou the tale may'st know) And as she slaughtered, so she buried him, Seeking to work a doom For thy young life all unendurable. Now thou dost hear the woes Thy father suffered, stained with foulest shame. Antistroph. VIII. Elect. Thou tellest of my father's death, but I Stood afar off, contemned, Counted as nought, and like an unsafe dog Shut up within, I poured the tide of tears (More ready they than smiles) Uttering in secret wail of weeping full. Hear thou these things, and write them in thy mind. Chor. Let the tale pierce thine ears, While thy soul onward moves with tranquil step: So much, thou know'st, stands thus; Thyself seek eagerly to know the rest; 'Tis meet to enter now Within the lists with mind inflexible. Stroph. IX. Orest. I bid thee, O my father, help thy friends. Elect. Bitterly weeping, these my tears I add. Chor. So all-consentient cries this company. Come then to light, and hear; Be with us 'gainst our foes. Antistroph. IX. Orest. My strength their strength, my Right their Right shall meet. Elect. Ye Gods, give righteous issue in that cause. Chor. Fear creeps upon me as I hear your prayers. Long waits the destined doom, But comes for those who pray. Stroph. X. Semi-Chor. A. Oh, woe that haunts the race, And harsh, shrill stroke of Atè's bloody scourge! Woes sad and hard to bear, Calling for wailing loud, Ah, woe is me, a grief immedicable. Antistroph. X. Semi-Chor. B. Yea, but as cure for this, And healing salve, 'tis yours with your own hands, With no help from without, To stir the strife of blood; So runs our hymn to those great Gods below. Chor. Yea, hearing now, ye blest Ones 'neath the earth, This prayer, send ye your children timely help That worketh victory. Orest. O sire, who in no kingly fashion died'st, Hear thou my prayer; grant victory o'er this house. Elect. I, father, ask this prayer, that I may work Ægisthos' death, and then acquittal gain. Orest. Yea, thus the banquets that men give the dead Would for thee too be held, but otherwise Dishonoured wilt thou lie 'mid those that feast, As in v. 351 the loss of honour among the dead was represented as one consequence of the absence of funeral rites from those who loved the dead, so here the restoration of the children to their rights appears as the condition without which that dishonour must continue. If they succeed, then, and then only, can they offer funeral banquets, year by year, as was the custom. There may be a special reference to an Argive custom mentioned by Plutarch (Quæst. Græc. c. 24) of sacrificing immediately after the death of a relative to Apollo, and thirty days later to Hermes. Robbed of thy country's rich burnt-offerings. Elect. I too from out my father's house will bring Libations from mine own inheritance, As marriage offerings. Chief and first of all, Will I do honour to this sepulchre. Orest. Set free my sire, O Earth, to watch the battle. Elect. O Persephassa, goodly victory grant! Orest. Remember, sire, the bath in which they slew thee! Elect. Remember thou the net they handselled so! Orest. In fetters not of brass wast thou snared, father. Elect. Yea, basely with that mantle they devised. Orest. Art thou not roused by these reproaches, father? Elect. Dost thou not lift thine head for those thou lov'st? Orest. Or send thou Justice to assist thy friends; Or let them get like grasp of those thy foes, If thou, o'ercome, dost wish to conquer them. Elect. And hear thou this last prayer of mine, my father, Seeing us thy nestlings sitting at thy tomb, Have mercy on thy boy and on thy girl; Nor blot thou out the seed of Pelopids: So thou, though thou hast died, art yet not dead; For children are the voices that preserve Man's memory when he dies. So bear the net The corks that float the flax-mesh from the deep. Hear thou: This is our wailing cry for thee, And thou, this prayer regarding, sav'st thyself. Chor. Unblamed have ye your utterance lengthened out, Amends for that his tomb's unwept-for lot. But as to what remains, since thou'rt resolved To act, act now; make trial of thy Fate. Orest. So shall it be. Yet 'tis not out of course To ask why she libations sent, why thus Too late she cares for ill she cannot cure? Yea, to a dead man heeding not 'twas sent, A sorry offering. Why, I fail to guess: The gifts are far too little for the fault; For should a man pour all he has to pay For one small drop of blood, the toil were vain: So runs the saying. But if thou dost know, Tell this to me as wishing much to learn. Chor. I know, my child, for I was by. Stirred on By dreams and wandering terrors of the night, That godless woman these libations sent. Orest. And have ye learnt the dream, to tell it right? Chor. As she doth say, she thought she bare a snake. Orest. How ends the tale, and what its outcome then? Chor. She nursed it, like a child, in swaddling clothes. Orest. What food did that young monster crave for then? Chor. She in her dream her bosom gave to it. Orest. How 'scaped her breast by that dread beast unhurt? Chor. Nay, with the milk it sucked out clots of blood. Orest. This dream comes from her lord, and not in vain. Chor. She, roused from sleep, cries out all terrified, And many torches that were quenched in gloom Blazed for our mistress' sake within the house. Then these libations for the dead she sends, Hoping they'll prove good medicine of ills. Orest. Now to Earth here and my sire's tomb I pray, They leave not this strange vision unfulfilled. So I expound it that it all coheres; For if, the self-same spot that I left leaving, The snake was then wrapt in my swaddling clothes, And sucked the very breast that nourished me, And mixed the sweet milk with a clot of blood, And she in terror wailed the strange event, So must she, as that monster dread she nourished, Die cruel death: and I, thus serpentised, Am here to slay her, as this dream portends; And thee as augur of these things I take. Chor. So be it; but in all else guide thy friends; Bid some do this, some that, some nought at all. Orest. Simple my orders, that she [pointing to Electra] go within; And you, I charge you, hide these plans of mine, That they who slew a noble soul by guile, By guile may die and in the self-same snare Be caught, as Loxias gave his oracle, The king Apollo, seer that never lied: For like a stranger in full harness clad Will I draw near with this man, Pylades, To the great gates, a stranger I, and he, Ally in arms. And then we both will speak Parnassian speech, and imitate the tone Of Phokian tongue. And should no porter there Give us good welcome, on the ground that now The house with ills is haunted, there we'll stay, So that a man who passeth by the house Will guess, and thus will speak, “Why drives Ægisthos The suppliant from his gate, if he's at home And knows it?” But if I should pass the threshold Of the great gate, and find him seated there Upon my father's throne, or if he comes And meets me, face to face, and lifts his eyes, And drops them, then be sure, before he says, “Whence is this stranger?”—I will lay him dead, With my swift-footed brazen weapon pierced; And then Erinnys, stinted not in slaughter, Shall drink her third draught of unmingled blood. Another reference to the third cup of undiluted wine which men drank to the honour of Zeus the Preserver. Comp. Agam. v. 245. Thou, then, [to Electra] watch well what passes in the house, So that these things may dovetail close and well: And you [to the Chorus] I bid to keep a tongue discreet, Silent, if need be, or the right word speaking, And Him [pointing to the statue of Apollo] I call to look upon me here, Since he has set me on this strife of swords. [Exeunt Orestes, Pylades, and Electra.] Chor. Stroph. I. Many dread forms of evils terrible Earth bears, and Ocean's bays With monsters wild and fierce O'erflow, and through mid-air the meteor lights Sweep by; and wingèd birds And creeping things can tell the vehement rage Of whirling storms of winds. Antistroph. I. But who man's temper overbold may tell, Or daring passionate loves Of women bold in heart, Passions close bound with men's calamities? Love that true love disowns, That sways the weaker sex in brutes and men, Usurps o'er wedlock's ties. Stroph. II. Whoso is not bird-witted, let him think What scheme she learnt to plan, Of subtle craft that wrought its will by fire, That wretched child of Thestios, who to slay Her son did set a-blaze The brand that glowed blood-red, Which had its birth when first from out the womb He came with infant's wail, And spanned the measure of its life with his, On to the destined day. The story of Althæa has recently been made familiar to English readers by Mr Swinburne's Atalanta in Calydon. More briefly told, the legend ran that she, being the wife of Œneus, bare a son, who was believed to be the child of Ares—that the Fates came to her when the boy, who was named Meleagros, was seven days old, and told her that his life should last until the firebrand then burning on the earth should be consumed. She took the firebrand, and quenched it, and laid it by in a chest; but when Meleagros grew up, he joined in the chase of the great boar of Calydon, and when he had slain it, gave the skin as a trophy to Atalanta, and when his mother's brothers, the sons of Thestios, claimed it as their right, he waxed wroth with them and slew them. And then Althæa, in her grief, caring more for her brothers than her son, took the brand from the chest, and threw it into the fire, and so Meleagros died. Phrynichos is said to have made the myth the subject of a drama. In Homer (Il. x. 566,) Althæa brings about her son's death by her curses. Antistroph. II. Another, too, must we with loathing name, Skylla, with blood defiled, Skylla (not to be confounded with the sea-monster of Messina) was the daughter of Nisos, king of Megaris, who had on his head a lock of purple hair, which was a charm that preserved his life from all danger. And the Cretans under Minos attacked Nisos, and besieged him in his city; and Minos won the love of Skylla, and tempted her with gifts, and she cut off her father's lock of hair, and so he perished. But Minos, scorning her for her deed, bound her by the feet to the stern of his ship and drowned her. Who for the sake of foes a dear one slew, Won by the gold-chased bracelets brought from Crete, The gifts that Minos gave, And knowing not the end, Robbed Nisos of his lock of deathless life, She with her dog-like heart Surprising him deep-breathing in his sleep; But Hermes comes on her. Hermes, i. e. in his office as the escort of the souls of the dead to Hades. Stroph. III. Yet since I tell the tale of ruthless woes, And now 'tis not the time To tell of evil marriage which this house Doth loathe and execrate, And of a woman's schemes and stratagems Against a warrior chief, Chief whom his people honoured as was meet, I give my praise to hearth from hot broils free, And praise that woman's mood Which boldness harbours not. Antistroph. III. But of all crimes the Lemnian foremost stands, The story of the Lemnian women is told by Herodotos, (vi. 138.) They rose up against their husbands and put them all to death; and the deed passed into a proverb, so that all great crimes were spoken of as Lemnian. And the Earth mourns that woe As worthy of all loathing. Yes, this guilt One might have well compared With Lemnian ills; and now that race is gone, To lowest shame brought down By the foul stain the Gods abominate: For no man honours what the Gods condemn. Which instance of all these Do I not rightly urge? Stroph. IV. And now the sword already at the heart, Sharp-pointed, strikes a blow that pierces through, While Justice guides the hand; For lo! the lawlessness Of one who doth transgress all lawlessly The might and majesty of Zeus, lies not As trampled under foot. Antistroph. IV. The anvil-block of Justice firm is set, And Fate, the sword-smith, hammers on the bronze Beforehand; and the child Is brought unto his home, And in due time the debt of guilt is paid By old Erinnys, famed for counsel deep, For blood of former days. [Orestes and Pylades enter, disguised as Phokian travellers, go to the door of the palace, and knock loudly. Orest. What ho, boy! hear us knocking at the gate. Who is within, boy? who, boy?—hear, again; A third time now I give my summons here, If good Ægisthos' house be hospitable. [A Slave opens the door. Slave. Let be; I hear. What stranger comes, and whence? Orest. Tell thou thy lords who over this house rule, To whom I come and tidings new report; And make good speed, for now the dusky car Of night comes on apace, and it is time For travellers in hospitable homes To cast their anchor; and let some one come From out the house who hath authority; The lady, if so be one ruleth here, But, seemlier far, her lord; for then no shame In converse makes our words obscure and dim; But man with man gains courage to speak out, And makes his mission manifest as day. Enter Clytæmnestra. Clytæm. If ye need aught, O strangers, speak; for here Is all that's fitting for a house like ours; Warm baths, So in Homer, (Il. xxii. 444,) the warm bath is prepared by Andromache for Hector on his return from the battle in which he fell. and bed that giveth rest from toil, And presence of right honest faces too; And if there be that needeth counsel more, This is our lords' work and to them we'll tell it. Orest. A Daulian traveller, from Phokis come, Am I, and as I went on business bound, My baggage with me, unto Argos, (just As I set forth,) I met a man I knew not, Who knew not me, and he then, having asked My way and told me his, the Phokian Strophios (For so I learnt in talking) said to me, “Since thou dost go, my friend, for Argos bound, In any case, tell those who gave him birth, Remembering it right well, Orestes' death; See thou forget it not, and whether plans Prevail to fetch him home, or bury him There where he is, a stranger evermore, Bear back the message as thy freight for us; For now the ribbed sides of an urn of bronze The ashes hide of one whom men have wept.” So much I heard and now have told; and if I speak to kin that have a right in him I know not, but his father sure should know it. Clytæm. Ah, thou hast told how utterly our ruin Is now complete! O Curse of this our house Full hard to wrestle with! How many things, Though lying out of reach, thou aimest at, And with well-darted arrows from afar Dost bring them low! And now thou strippest me, Most wretched one, of all that most I loved. A lucky throw Orestes now was making, Getting his feet from our destruction's slough; But now the hope of high, exulting joy, Which this house had as healer, he scores down As present in this fashion that we see. Orest. I could have wished to come to prosperous hosts, As known and welcomed for my tidings good; For who to hosts is friendlier than a guest? But 'twould have been as impious in my thoughts Not to complete this matter for my friends, By promise bound and pledged as guest to host. Clytæm. Thou shalt not meet with less than thou deserv'st; Nor wilt thou be to this house less a friend; Another would have brought news all the same: But since 'tis time that strangers who have made A long day's journey find the things they need, Lead him [to her Slave, pointing to Orestes] to these our hospitable halls, And these his fellow-travellers and servants. There let them meet with what befits our house. I bid thee act as one who gives account; And we unto the masters of our house Will tell this news, and with no lack of friends Deliberate of this calamity. As in her speeches in the Agamemnon, (vv. 595, 884,) Clytæmnestra's words here also are full of significant ambiguity. The “things that befit the house,” the proposed conference with Ægisthos, her separation of Orestes from his companions, are all indications of suspicion already half-aroused. The last three lines were probably spoken as an “aside.” [Exeunt Clytæmnestra, Orestes, Pylades, and Attendants.] Chor. Come then, handmaids of the palace, When shall we with mighty voices Shew our feeling for Orestes? O earth revered! thou ridge revered, too, Of the mound piled o'er the body Of our navy's kingly captain, Oh, hear us now; oh, come and help us; For 'tis time for subtle Suasion Suasion is personified, and invoked to come and win Clytæmnestra to trust herself in the power of the two avengers. To go with them to the conflict, And that Hermes act as escort, He who dwells in earth's deep darkness, In the strife where swords work mischief. Enter Kilissa. Chor. The stranger seems about to work some ill; And here I see Orestes' nurse in tears. Where then, Kilissa, art thou bound, that thus Thou tread'st the palace-gates, and with thee comes Grief as a fellow-traveller unbidden? Kilis. Our mistress bids me with all speed to call Ægisthos to the strangers, that he come And hear more clearly, as a man from man, This newly-brought report. Before her slaves, Under set eyes of melancholy cast, She hid her inner chuckle at the events That have been brought to pass—too well for her, But for this house and hearth most miserably,— As in the tale the strangers clearly told. He, when he hears and learns the story's gist, Will joy, I trow, in heart. Ah, wretched me! How those old troubles, of all sorts made up, Most hard to bear, in Atreus' palace-halls Have made my heart full heavy in my breast! But never have I known a woe like this. For other ills I bore full patiently, But as for dear Orestes, my sweet charge, Whom from his mother I received and nursed. ... And then the shrill cries rousing me o'nights, And many and unprofitable toils For me who bore them. For one needs must rear The heedless infant like an animal, (How can it else be?) as his humour serves. For while a child is yet in swaddling clothes, It speaketh not, if either hunger comes, Or passing thirst, or lower calls of need; And children's stomach works its own content. And I, though I foresaw this, call to mind How I was cheated, washing swaddling clothes, And nurse and laundress did the self-same work. I then with these my double handicrafts, Brought up Orestes for his father dear; And now, woe's me! I learn that he is dead, And go to fetch the man that mars this house: And gladly will he hear these words of mine. Chor. And how equipped then doth she bid him come? Nurse. ‘How?’ Speak again, that I may better learn. Chor. By spearmen followed, or himself alone? Nurse. She bids him bring his guards with lances armed. Chor. Nay, say not that to him thy lord doth hate, But bid him ‘come alone,’ (that so he hear Without alarm,) full speed, with joyous mind, Since ‘secret speech with messengers goes best.’ Nurse. And art thou of good cheer at this my tale? Chor. But what if Zeus will turn the tide of ill? Nurse. How so? Orestes, our one hope, is gone. Chor. Not yet; a sorry seer might know thus much. Nurse. What say'st thou? Know'st thou aught besides my tale? Chor. Go, tell thy message; do thine errand well: The Gods for what they care for, care enough. Nurse. I then will go, complying with thy words: May all, by God's gift, end most happily! Chor. Stroph. I. Now to my prayer, O Father of the Gods Of high Olympos, Zeus, Grant that their fortune may be blest indeed Who long to look on goodness prospering well, Yea, with full right and truth I speak the word—O Zeus, preserve thou him! Stroph. II. Yea, Zeus, set him whom now the palace holds, Set him above his foes; For if thou raise him high, Then shalt thou have, to thy heart's full content Payment of two-fold, three-fold recompense. Antistroph. I. Know that the son of one who loved thee well Like colt of sire bereaved, Is to the chariot of great evils yoked, And set thy limit to his weary path. Ah, would that one might see His outstretched footsteps, as he treads his course, Keeping due measure through this plain of ours! Stroph. III. And ye within the gate, Ye Gods, in purpose one, Who dwell in shrines enriched With all good things, come ye, And now with vengeance fresh Atone for murder foul Of those that fell long since: And let that blood of old, When these are justly slain, Breed no more in our house. Mesode. O Thou Apollo in the shrine at Delphi. that dwellest in the cavern vast, Adorned with goodly gifts, Grant our lord's house to look up yet once more, And that it now look up In free and glorious guise With loving kindly eyes, From out its veil of gloom. Let Maia's son Hermes invoked once more, as at once the patron of craft and the escort of the dead, too give His righteous help, and waft Good end with prosperous gale. Antistroph. III. And things that now are hid, He, if he will, will bring As to the daylight clear; But when it pleases him Dark, hidden words to speak, As in thick night he bears Black gloom before his face; Or “before our eyes.” Nor is he in the day One whit more manifest. Stroph. IV. And then our treasured store, The price as ransom paid To free the house from ill, A woman's gift on breath Of favouring breeze onborne, We then with clamorous cry, To sound of cithern sweet, Will in the city pour; And if this prospers well, My gains, yea, mine 'twill swell, and Atè then From those I love stands far. Antistroph. II. But thou, take courage, when the time is come For action, and cry out, Shouting thy Father's name, When she shall cry aloud the name of “son,” And work thou out a woe that none will blame. Antistroph. IV. And have thou in thy breast The heart that Perseus had, As Perseus could only overcome the Gorgon, Medusa, by turning away his eyes, lest looking on her he should turn to stone, so Orestes was to avoid meeting his mother's glance, lest that should unman him and blunt his purpose. And for thy friends beneath, And those on earth who dwell, Go thou and work the deed Acceptable to them Of bitter, wrathful mood, And consummate within The loathly work of blood; [And calling on the Right as thine ally,] Destroy the murderer. Enter Ægisthos. Ægis. Not without summons came I, but by word Of courier fetched, and learn that travellers bring Their tale of tidings new, in no wise welcome. As for Orestes' death, with it to charge The house would be a burden dropping fear To one by that old bloodshed sorely stung. Ægisthos had suffered enough, he says, for his share in Agamemnon's death. He has no wish that fresh odium should fall on him, as being implicated also in the death of Orestes, of which he has just heard. How shall I count these things? As clear and true? Or are they vague reports of woman's fears, That leap up high and die away to nought? What can'st thou say that will my mind inform? Chor. We heard, 'tis true; but go thou in and ask Of these same strangers. Nought is found in words Of messengers like asking them one's-self. Ægis. I wish to see and probe the messenger, If he himself were present at the death, Or tells it hearing of a vague report: They shall not cheat a mind with eyes wide open. [Exit. Chor. Zeus! Zeus! what words shall I Now speak, whence start in prayer, Invoking help of Gods? How with all wish for good Shall I speak fitting words? For now the sharp sword-points, Red with the blood of man, Will either work for aye The utter overthrow Of Agamemnon's house, Or, kindling fire and torch For freedom thus achieved, Will he the sceptre wield Of duly-ordered sway, His father's pride and state: Such is the contest he, Orestes, godlike one, Now wages all alone, The one sole combatant, The word (ephedros) was applied technically to one who sat by during a conflict between two athletes, prepared to challenge the victor to a fresh encounter. In place of him who fell, Against those twain. May victory be his! Ægisth. [groaning within] Ah! ah! ah! Chor. Hark! hark! How goes it now? How has the work been in the house accomplished? Let us hold back while they the deed are doing, That we may seem as guiltless of these ills: For surely now the fight has reached its end. Enter Servant from the chief door. Serv. Alas! alas! my master perishes! Alas! alas! a third time yet I call. Ægisthos is no more; but open now With all your speed, and loosen ye the bolts That bar the women's gates. A man's full strength Is needed; and yet that would be as nought To help a man that's slain. [Rushes to the gate of the women's half of the palace. Ho there! I say: I speak to the deaf; to those that sleep I utter In vain my useless cries. And where is she? Where's Clytæmnestra? What doth she do now? Her neck upon the razor's edge doth seem To fall, down-stricken by a vengeance just. Enter Clytæmnestra from the side door. Clytæm. What means all this? What cry is this thou mak'st? Serv. I say the dead are killing one who lives. Clytæm. Ah, me! I see the drift of thy dark speech; By guile we perish, as of old we slew: Let some one hand at once axe strong to slay; Let's see if we are conquered or can conquer, For in this ill to that point am I come. Enter Orestes from the other door. Orest. 'Tis thee I seek: he there has had enough. Clytæm. Ah me! my loved Ægisthos! Art thou dead? Orest. Lov'st thou the man? Then in the self-same tomb Shalt thou now lie, nor in his death desert him. Clytæm. [baring her bosom] Hold, boy! Respect this breast of mine, my son, So, in Homer, (Il. xxii. 79,) Hecuba, when the entreaties of Priam had been in vain, makes this the last appeal— “Then to the front his mother rushed, in tears, Her bosom bare, with either hand her breast Sustaining, and with tears addressed him thus, ‘Hector, my son, thy mother's breast revere.’” Whence thou full oft, asleep, with toothless gums, Hast sucked the milk that sweetly fed thy life. Orest. What shall I do, my Pylades? Shall I Through this respect forbear to slay my mother? Pyl. Where, then, are Loxias' other oracles, The Pythian counsels, and the fast-sworn vows? Have all men hostile rather than the Gods. The reader will note this as the only speech put into the lips of Pylades, though he is present as accompanying Orestes throughout great part of the drama. Orest. My judgment goes with thine; thou speakest well: [To Clytæmnestra.] Follow: I mean to slay thee where he lies, For while he lived thou held'st him far above My father. Sleep thou with him in thy death, Since thou lov'st him, and whom thou should'st love hatest. Clytæm. I reared thee, and would fain grow old with thee. Orest. What! Thou live with me, who did'st slay my father? Clytæm. Fate, O my son, must share the blame of that. Orest. This fatal doom, then, it is Fate that sends. Clytæm. Dost thou not fear a parent's curse, my son? Orest. Thou, though my mother, did'st to ill chance cast me. Clytæm. No outcast thou, so sent to house allied. Orest. I was sold doubly, though of free sire born. Clytæm. Where is the price, then, that I got for thee? Orest. I shrink for shame from pressing that charge home. Clytæm. Nay, tell thy father's wantonness as well. Orest. Blame not the man that toils when thou'rt at ease. Clytæm. 'Tis hard, my son, for wives to miss their husband. Orest. The husband's toil keeps her that sits at home. Clytæm. Thou seem'st, my son, about to slay thy mother. Orest. It is not I that slay thee, but thyself. Clytæm. Take heed, beware a mother's vengeful hounds. Orest. How, slighting this, shall I escape my father's? Clytæm. I seem in life to wail as to a tomb. The phrase “wail as to a tomb” seems to have been a bye-word for fruitless entreaty and lamentation. Orest. My father's fate ordains this doom for thee. Clytæm. Ah me! the snake is here I bare and nursed. Orest. An o'er-true prophet was that dread dream-born; Thou slewest one thou never should'st have slain, Now suffer what should never have been thine. [Exit Orestes, leading Clytæmnestra into the palace, and followed by Pylades. Chor. E'en of these two I wail the twin mischance; But since long line of murder culminates In poor Orestes, this we still accept, That he, our one light, fall not utterly. Stroph. I. Late came due vengeance on the sons of Priam, Just forfeit of sore woe;— Late came there too to Agamemnon's house, Twin lions, two-fold Death. The words must be left in their obscurity. Commentators have conjectured Orestes and Pylades, or the deaths of Agamemnon and Iphigeneia, or those of Ægisthos and Clytæmnestra, as the “two lions” spoken of. The first seems most in harmony with the context. The exile who obeyed the Pythian hest Hath gained his full desire, Sped on his way by counsel from the Gods. Stroph. II. Shout ye, loud shout for the escape from ills Our master's house has seen, And from the wasting of his ancient wealth By that defiled pair, Ill fate intolerable. Antistroph. I. And so on him who loves the war of guile Came Vengeance subtle-souled; And in the strife of hands the child of Zeus In very deed gave help, (We mortals call her Justice, hitting well The meetest name for her,) Breathing destroying wrath against her foes. Stroph. III. She, she it is whom Loxias summons now, Who dwelleth in Parnassia's cavern vast, Invoking her who still Is guileful guilelessly, Working great ill, though tarrying long in it: The will of Gods is strangely overruled; It may not help the vile; The Eternal Justice which orders all things is mightier than any arbitrary will, such as men attribute to the Gods. That Will, even if we dare to think of it as changeable or evil, is held in restraint. It cannot, even if it will, protect the evil-doers. 'Tis meet to adore the Power that rules in Heaven: Now may we see the light. Antistroph. II. Now is the bit that curbed the slaves ta'en off: The Chorus feel that they have been too long silent; now, at last, they can speak. As slaves dreading punishment they had been gagged before; now the gag is removed. Arise, arise, O house: Too long, too long, all prostrate on the ground Ye have been used to lie. Antistroph. III. Quickly all-working Time will bring a change Across the threshold of the palace old, When from the altar-hearth It shall drive all the guilt, With cleansing rites that chase away our woes; And Fortune's throws shall fall with gladsome cast, Once more benign to see, Or “Once more for those who wail.” For new-come strangers settled in the house: Now may we see the light. Enter Orestes, Pylades, and followers from the palace. His attendants bear the robe in which Agamemnon had been murdered. Orest. See ye this country's tyrant rulers twain, My father's murderers, wasters of his house; Stately were they, seen sitting on their thrones, Friends too e'en now, to argue from their fate, And oaths are kept to every pledge they gave. Firmly they swore that they would slay my father, And die together. Well they keep their oaths: And ye who hear these ills, behold again Their foul device, as bonds for my poor father, Handcuffs, and fetters both his feet to bind. Come, stretch it out, and standing all around, Show ye the snare that wrapt him o'er, that He May see, our Father,—not of mine I speak, But the great Sun that looks on all we do,— My mother's deeds, defilèd and impure, That He may be a witness in my cause, That I did justly bring this doom to pass Against my mother. ... Of Ægisthos' fate No word I speak. He bears the penalty, As runs the law, of an adulterer's guilt; But she who planned this crime against a man By whom she knew the weight of children borne Beneath her girdle, once a burden loved, But now, as this shews clear, a grievous ill, What seems she to you? Had she viper been, Or fell myræna, It is not clear with what form of animal life the myræna is to be identified. The idea implied is that of some sea monster whose touch was poisonous, but this does not hold good of the “lamprey.” she with touch alone, Rather than bite, had made a festering sore With that bold daring of unrighteous mood. What shall I call it, using mildest speech? A wild beast's trap?—a pall that wraps a bier, And hides a dead man's feet?—A net, I trow, A snare, a robe entangling, one might call it. Such might be owned by one to plunder trained, Practised in duping travellers, and the life That robs men of their money; with this trick Destroying many, many deeds of ill His fevered brain might hatch. May such as she Ne'er share my dwelling! May the hand of God Far rather smite me that I childless die! Chor. [looking on Agamemnon's robe,] Ah me! ah me! these deeds most miserable! By hateful murder thou wast done to death. Woe, woe is me! And evil buds and blooms for him that's left. Orest. Was the deed hers or no? Lo! this same robe Bears witness how she dyed Ægisthos' sword, And the blood-stain helps Time's destroying work, Marring full many a tint of pattern fair: Now cite I it, and as eye-witness wail; And calling on this robe that slew my father, Moan for all done and suffered, wail my race, Stained with the guilt of conquest none need envy. Chor. No mortal man shall live a life unharmed, Stout-hearted and rejoicing evermore. Woe, woe is me! One trouble vexes now, another comes. Orest. (wildly, as one distraught,) That ye may know ... for I know not its issue. ... Like chariot-driver with my steeds I'm dragged Out of my course; for every mood uncurbed Bears me its victim headlong. At my heart Stands terror ready or to sing or dance In burst of passion. While my reason stays, I tell my friends here that I slew my mother, Not without right, my father's murderess, Accursed and hated of the Gods. And I As chiefest spell that made me dare this deed Count Loxias, Pythian prophet, warning me That doing this I should be free from blame, But slighting. ... I pass o'er the penalty Comp. vv. 270–288.. ... For none, aim as he will, such woes will hit. And now ye see me, in what guise equipped, [Putting on the suppliant's wreaths, and taking an olive branch in his hand. With this my bough and chaplet I will gain Earth's central shrine, the home where Loxias dwells, And the bright fire that is as deathless known, Delphi was to the Greek (as Jerusalem was to mediæval Christendom) the centre at once of his religious life and of the material earth. Its rock was the omphalos of the world. Consecrated widows watched over the sacred and perpetual fire. Once only up to the time of Æschylos, when the Temple itself was desecrated by the Persians, had it ceased to burn. Seeking to 'scape this guilt of kindred blood; And on no other hearth, so Loxias bade, May I seek shelter. And I charge you all, Ye Argives, bear ye witness in due time How these dark deeds of wretched ill were wrought: But I, a wanderer, exiled from my land, Shall live, and leaving these my prayers in death, ... Chor. Nay, thou hast prospered: burden not thy lips With evil speech, nor speak ill-boding words, When thou hast freed the Argive commonwealth, By good chance lopping those two serpents' heads. [The Erinnyes are seen in the back-ground, in black robes, and with snakes in their hair. Orest. Ah! ah! ye handmaids: see, like Gorgons these, Dark-robed, and all their tresses hang entwined With many serpents. I can stay no longer. Chor. What phantoms vex thee, best beloved of sons By thy dear sire? Hold, fear not, victory's thine. Orest. These are no phantom terrors that I see: Full clear they are my mother's vengeful hounds. Chor. The blood fresh-shed is yet upon thy hands; And thence it is these troubles haunt thy soul. Orest. O King Apollo! See, they swarm, they swarm, And from their eyes is dropping loathsome blood. Chor. One way of cleansing is there; Loxias' form Clasp thou, and he will free thee from these ills. Orest. These forms ye see not, but I see them there: They drive me on, and I can bear no more. Chor. Well, may'st thou prosper; may our gracious God Watch o'er and guard thee with a chance well timed! Here, then, upon this palace of our kings A third storm blows again; The wind that haunts the race has run its course. First came the wretched meal of children's flesh; Next what befell our king: Slain in the bath was he who ruled our host, Of all the Achæans lord; And now a third has come, we know not whence, Once again we have the thought of the third cup offered as a libation to Zeus as saviour and deliverer. The Chorus asks whether this third deed of blood will be true to that idea and work out deliverance. To save ... or shall I say, To work a doom of death? Where will it end? Where will it cease at last, The strength of woe that now Is lulled awhile to sleep?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX OF RHYMED CHORUSES. Verses 20–75.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. Lo, from the palace door, We wend our way to pour Gifts on the dead; And in our bitter woe, Our hands with many a blow Smite breast and head. On each fair cheek the nail Has ploughed full many a trail, And all to tatters torn The garments we have worn; The foldings of the vest O'er maiden's swelling breast Are roughly rent; For now on us the chance That shuts out joy and dance Our fate hath sent; Antistroph. I. A spectral vision clear Thrills every hair with fear. Prophet our home doth keep, In dreams of haunted sleep, Breathing of dire distress In the deep hid recess, Breaking with cry of fright The still deep hush of night; All through the queenly bower Sharp cry was heard that hour, And they to whom 'twas given To read decrees of Heaven, In dream o'ertrue, By solemn pledges bound, Declared that underground The dead were wrathful found 'Gainst those that slew. Stroph. II. And so the godless queen In eager haste is seen,— Sends me with gifts like this, Full graceless grace, I wis, As if, (O mother Earth, To whom we owe our birth!) To banish dread. And I would fain delay This prayer of mine to pray: What ransom can men pay For blood once shed? Oh, hearth and home of woe! Oh, utter overthrow! Foul mists brood o'er our halls; No ray of sunlight falls; Thick darkness from the tomb Of heroes makes the gloom Yet more intense. Antistroph. II. And awe that once we knew, Strong, mighty to subdue, Falling on every ear, Thrilling each soul with fear, Is gone far hence. There be that well may bow In craven terror now, For lo! Success enthroned As more than God is owned. But Vengeance will not fail Ere long to turn the scale. On some her strokes alight, While yet their day is bright; Some, as in twilight's gloom, O'erflow with gathering doom; Some endless night doth hold In realm of darkness old. Stroph. III. And for the blood which Earth, To whom it owed its birth, Hath drunk, there still doth wait A stern avenging Fate: The stain of blood doth stay, And will not pass away, And nerves are thrilled with pain In soul that sets in train The plague that works amain Its evil great. Antistroph. III. All help from him hath fled Who with adulterous tread Defiles another's bed. Though many streams should pour Their waters o'er and o'er, Those waters evermore Are poured in vain; They cannot wash away The guilt that yet will stay, Blood's crimson stain. Epode. But since to me by Heaven The exile's life is given (Yea, far from home I know The bond-slave's cup of woe) I needs must yield assent To good or ill intent, Accepting their commands Who rule with sceptred hands. Yea, I must hide my hate In this my evil fate, And under strong control Keep my rebellious soul, And now beneath my veil I weep my woes' full tale; For cares that vex and fret My cheeks with tears are wet. Verses 576–639.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. Many dread forms of woe and fear the Earth Doth breed; and Ocean's deep Is full of foes men hate, of monstrous birth; And Air's high pathways keep Their flashing meteors; birds that wing their flight, And things on earth that creep, And one might tell the wrath of whirlwind's might, When tempests wildly sweep. Antistroph. I. But who can tell man's purpose overbold? Or woman's, prompt to dare? Or the strong loves that men in bondage hold, And bring woe everywhere? Or strange conjunctions of the hearth and home? But still the palm they bear, The loves unloved that women overcome, And hold dominion there. Stroph. II. And one whose thoughts are not o'erswift of wing, May learn and ponder well What purpose Thestios' child to act did bring, Purpose most dire and fell, Her burning thought who did her own child slay, Kindling the torch of death That with her child's life kept its equal way, Since coming from his mother's womb he cried, To that predestined day on which at last he died. Antistroph. II. And yet another must I in my song Devote to hate and scorn, The murderess Skylla, who to deeds of wrong By Minos' gifts was borne, And for her foes' sake slew a man she loved For Cretan chains gold-wrought; She with dog's heart the deathless lock removed From him, in deep sleep sunk; yet Hermes' power She too was taught at last at her appointed hour. Stroph. III. But since I tell my tale of loathly crime, And of ill-omened marriage out of time, Wedlock our house abhors, The schemes and plots of women steeped in guile Against a warrior chief, a chief erewhile The dread of foes in wars, The foremost place I give to altar-hearth Where no wrath burns and woman knows the worth Of mood from daring free. Antistroph. III. Yet of all ills the Lemnian first may stand, The cry of loathing rings through all the land, And still each crime of dread A man will liken to the Lemnian ill, And now by woe that comes from God's stern will The race is gone and fled, Of all men scorned, for no man looks with love On deeds that to the high Gods hateful prove; Is not this clear to see? Stroph. IV. And lo! the sword sharp-pointed pierces deep, E'en to the heart, the sword which Vengeance wields; The lawless deed will not neglected sleep, When men tread down what fear of high heaven shields; Antistroph. IV. But still the block of Vengeance firm doth stand, And Fate, as swordsmith, hammers blow on blow; And then with thoughts that none can understand, Erinnys comes far known, though working slow, And to the old house brings the youthful heir, That deeds of blood wrought out of olden time May the due judgment bear For each polluting crime. Verses 769–820.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. Oh, hear me, hear my prayer, thou mighty Lord! Sire of all Gods that on Olympos dwell, Hear Thou, and grant my longing heart's desire, That those who wise of heart would fain do well May see each prayer for right Fulfilled in holiest might; That prayer, O Zeus, I pray. Stroph. II. Do Thou protect him, yea, O Zeus, and bring Before his foes on yonder secret way; For if thou raise him high, then Thou, O king, Shalt to thy heart's content Receive a twofold, threefold recompense, For that thine anger bent Against each old offence. Antistroph. I. Look on the son of one whom Thou did'st love, Like orphan colt fast bound to car of woes; Set Thou a mark that may as limit prove; Ah, might one watch his footsteps as he goes, In measured course and true, This his own country through! Stroph. III. And ye who in our home Stand in the shrine with plenteous wealth full stored, Hear, O ye Gods, and come, Yea, come with one accord, Lead him on, wash away With vengeance new the blood of crime of old; Let not the old guilt stay To breed fresh offspring where our home we hold. Mesode. But grant him good success, O Thou who dost within the great cave dwell! With upward glance of joy our chief's house bless, And that he too, full well, Freely and brightly with the dear, loved eyes, May look from out the veil of cloudy skies. Antistroph. III. And then may Maia's son Assist him, as is meet, in this his task! Through Him success is won, The boon that now we ask: And many secret things will He make clear, If that should be his will, But should He choose the truth should not appear, Before men's eyes He still Brings darkness and the blackness of the night, Nor is He clearer in the day's full light. Stroph. IV.
