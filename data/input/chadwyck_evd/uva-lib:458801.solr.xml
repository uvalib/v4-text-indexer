      <field name="fulltext">The PROLOGVE. He that hath feasted you these forty yeares, And fitted Fables, for your finer eares, Although at first, he scarce could hit the bore; Yet you, with patience harkning more and more, At length have growne up to him, and made knowne, The Working of his Pen is now your owne: He pray's you would vouchsafe, for your owne sake, To heare him this once more, but, sit awake. And though hee now present you with such wooll, As from meere English Flocks his Muse can pull, He hopes when it is made up into Cloath; Not the most curious head here will be loath To weare a Hood of it; it being a Fleece, To match, or those of Sicily, or Greece. His Scene is Sherwood: And his Play a Tale Of Robin-hood's inviting from the Vale Of Be'voir, all the Shep'ards to a Feast: Where, by the casuall absence of one Guest, The Mirth is troubled much, and in one Man As much of sadnesse showne, as Passion can. The sad young Shep'ard, whom wee here present, The sad Sheep'ard passeth silently over the Stage.Like his woes Figure, darke and discontent, For his lost Love; who in the Trent is said, To have miscarried; 'lasse! what knowes the head Of a calme River, whom the feet have drown'd? Heare what his sorrowes are; and, if they wound Your gentle brests, so that the End crowne all, Which in the Scope of one dayes chance may fall: Old Trent will send you more such Tales as these, And shall grow young againe, as one doth please. Here the Prologue thinking to end, returnes upon a new purpose, and speakes on. But here's an Heresie of late let fall; That Mirth by no meanes fits a Pastorall; Such say so, who can make none, he presumes: Else, there's no Scene, more properly assumes The Sock. For whence can sport in kind arise, But from the Rurall Routs and Families? Safe on this ground then, wee not feare to day, To tempt your laughter by our rustick Play. Wherein if we distaste, or be cry'd downe, Wee thinke wee therefore shall not leave the Towne; Nor that the Fore-wits, that would draw the rest Vnto their liking, alwayes like the best. The wise, and knowing Critick will not say, This worst, or better is, before he weigh; Where every piece be perfect in the kind: And then, though in themselves he difference find, Yet if the place require it where they stood, The equall fitting makes them equall good. You shall have Love and Hate, and Iealousie, As well as Mirth, and Rage, and Melancholy: Or whatsoever else may either move, Or stirre affections, and your likings prove. But that no stile for Pastorall should goe Current, but what is stamp'd with Ah, and O; Who judgeth so, may singularly erre; As if all Poesie had one Character: In which what were not written, were not right, Or that the man who made such one poore flight, In his whole life, had with his winged skill Advanc'd him upmost on the Muses hill. When he like Poet yet remaines, as those Are Painters who can only make a Rose. From such your wits redeeme you, or your chance, Lest to a greater height you doe advance Of Folly, to contemne those that are knowne Artificers, and trust such as are none.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. THE ARGVMENT of the first Act. Robin-hood, having invited all the Shep'erds and Shep'erdesses of the Vale of Be'voir, to a Feast in the Forrest of Sherwood, and trusting to his Mistris, Maid Marian, with her Wood-men, to kill him Venison against the day: Having left the like charge with Friar Tuck his Chaplaine, and Steward, to command the rest of his merry men, to see the Bowre made ready, and all things in order for the entertainment; meeting with his Guests at their entrance into the Wood, welcomes and conducts them to his Bowre. Where, by the way hee receives the relation of the sad Shep'ard Eglamour, who is falne into a deepe Melancholy, for the losse of his beloved Earine; reported to have beene drowned in passing over the Trent, some few dayes before. They endeavour in what they can to comfort him: but, his disease having taken so strong root, all is in vaine, and they are forced to leave him. In the meane time Marian is come from hunting with the Hunts-men, where the Lovers interchangeably expresse their loves. Robin-hood enquires if she hunted the Deere at force, and what sport he made, how long hee stood, and what head hee bore: All which is briefly answer'd with a relation of breaking him up, and the Raven, and her Bone. The suspect had of that Raven to be Maudlin, the Witch of Paple-wick, whom one of the Huntsmen met i' the morning, at the rowsing of the Deere, and is confirm'd by her being then in Robin-hoods Kitchin, i' the Chimney-corner, broyling the same bit, which was throwne to the Raven, at the Quarry or Fall of the Deere. Marian being gone in, to shew the Deere to some of the Shepherdesses, returnes instantly to the Scene discontented, sends away the Venison she had kill'd, to her they call the Witch, quarrels with her Love Robin-hood, abuseth him, and his Guests the Shep'erds; and so departs, leaving them all in wonder and perplexitie. Scene I. Aeglamour. Here! she was wont to goe! and here! and here! Just where those Daisies, Pincks, and Violets grow: The world may find the Spring by following her; For other print her aerie steps neere left: Her treading would not bend a blade of grasse! Or shake the downie Blow-ball from his stalke! But like the soft West-wind, she shot along, And where she went, the Flowers tooke thickest root, As she had sow'd 'hem with her odorous foot. Scene II. Marian. Tuck. Iohn. Wood-men, &amp;c. Mar. Know you, or can you guesse, my merry men, What 'tis that keepes your Master Robin-hood So long both from his Marian, and the Wood? Tuc. Forsooth, Madam, hee will be here by noone, And prayes it of your bounty as a boone, That you by then have kild him Venison some, To feast his jolly friends, who hether come In threaves to frolick with him, and make cheare; Here's Little Iohn hath harbord you a Deere, I see by his tackling. Io. And a Hart of ten, I trow hee be, Madam, or blame your men: For by his Slot, his Entries, and his Port, His Frayings, Fewmets, he doth promise sport, And standing 'fore the Dogs; hee beares a head, Large, and well beam'd: with all rights somm'd, and spred. Mar. Let's rowse him quickly, and lay on the Hounds. Io. Scathlock is ready with them on the grounds; So is his brother Scarlet: now they'ave found His Layre, they have him sure within the pound. Mor. Away then, when my Robin bids a Feast, 'Twere sinne in Marian to defraud a Guest. Scene III. Tuck. George a Greene. Much. Aeglamour. Tuc. And I, the Chaplaine, here am left to be Steward to day, and charge you all in fee, To d'on your Liveries; see the Bower drest; And fit the fine devises for the Feast: You George must care to make the Baldrick trim, And Garland that must crowne, or her, or him; Whose Flock this yeare, hath brought the earliest Lambe! Geo. Good Father Tuck, at your Commands I am To cut the Table out O the greene sword, Or any other service for my Lord; To carve the Guests large feats; and these laid in With turfe (as soft and smooth as the Moles skin:) And hang the bulled Nose-gaies 'bove their heads, The Pipers banck, whereon to sit and play; And a faire Dyall to meete out the day. Our Masters Feast shall want no just delights: His entertainments must have all the rites. Muc. I, and all choise that plenty can send in; Bread, Wine, Acates, Fowle, Feather, Fish, or Fin, Aeglamour fals in with them. For which my Fathers Nets have swept the Trent. Aeg. And ha' you found her? Mu. Whom? Aeg. My drowned Love. Earine! the sweet Earine! The bright, and beautifull Earine! Have you not heard of my Earine? Just by your Fathers Mills (I thinke I am right) Are not you Much the Millers sonne? Mu. I am. Aeg. And Baily to brave Robin-hood? Mu. The same. Aeg. Close by your Fathers Mills, Earine! Earine was drown'd! O my Earine! (Old Maudlin tells me so, and Douce her Daughter) Ha' you swept the River say you? and not found her? Muc. For Fowle, and Fish wee have. Aeg. O not for her? You'are goodly friends! right charitable men! Nay, keepe your way, and leave me: make your toyes, Your tales, your poesies, that you talk'd of; all Your entertainments: you not injure me: Onely if I may enjoy my Cipresse wreath! And you will let me weepe! ('tis all I aske;) Till I be turn'd to water, as was she! And troth what lesse suit can you grant a man? Tuck. His Phantasie is hurt, let us now leave him: The wound is yet too fresh, to admit searching. Aeg. Searching? where should I search? or on what track? Can my slow drop of teares, or this darke shade About my browes, enough describe her losse! Earine, O my Earine's losse! No, no, no, no; this heart will breake first. Geo. How will this sad disaster strike the eares Of bounteous Robin-hood, our gentle Master? Mu. How will it marre his mirth, abate his feast; And strike a horror into every guest! Aeg. If I could knit whole clouds about my browes, And weepe like Swithen, or those watry signes, The Kids that rise then, and drowne all the Flocks Of those rich Shepherds, dwelling in this Vale; Those carelesse Shepherds, that did let her drowne! Then I did something or could make old Trent Drunke with my sorrow, to start out in breaches To drowne their Herds, their cattle, and their corne, Breake downe their Mils, their Dams, ore-turne their weeres, And see their houses, and whole lively-hood Wrought into water, with her, all were good: I'ld kisse the torrent, and those whirles of Trent, That suck'd her in, my sweet Earine! When they have cast their body on the shore, And it comes up, as tainted as themselves, All pale and bloodlesse, I will love it still, For all that they can doe, and make 'hem mad, To see how I will hugge it in mine armes! And hang upon the lookes, dwell on her eyes: Feed round about her lips, and eate her kisses! Suck of her drowned flesh! and where's their malice? Not all their envious sousing can change that: But I will study some revenge past this! I pray you give me leave, for I will study. Though all the Bels, Pipes, Tabors, Timburines ring That you can plant about me: I will study. Scene IIII. To him. Robin-hood. Clarion. Mellifleur. Lionel. Amie. Alken. Tuck. Servants, with musick of all sorts. Rob. Welcome bright Clarion, and sweet Mellifleur, The courteous Lionel, faire Amie; all My friends and neighbours, to the Jolly Bower Of Robin-hood, and to the greene-wood Walkes: Now that the shearing of your sheepe is done, And the wash'd Flocks are lighted of their wooll, The smoother Ewes are ready to receive. The mounting Rams againe; and both doe feed, As either promist to increase your breed At eaning time; and bring you lusty twins. Why should, or you, or wee so much forget The season in our selves: as not to make Vse of our youth, and spirits, to awake The nimble Horne-pipe, and the Timburine, And mixe our Songs, and Dances in the Wood, And each of us cut downe a Triumph-bough. Such were the Rites, the youthfull Iune allow. Cla. They were, gay Robin, but the sowrer sort Of Shepherds now disclaime in all such sport: And say, our Flocks the while, are poorely fed, When with such vanities the Swaines are led. Tuc. Would they, wise Clarion, were not hurried more With Covetise and Rage, when to their store They adde the poore mans Eaneling, and dare sell Both Fleece, and Carkasse, not gi'ing him the Fell. When to one Goat, they reach that prickly weed, Which maketh all the rest forbeare to feed; Or strew Tods haires, or with their tailes doe sweepe The dewy grasse, to d'off the simpler sheepe; Or digge deepe pits, their Neighbours Neat to vexe, To drowne the Calves, and crack the Heifers necks. Or with pretence of chasing thence the Brock, Send in a curre to worrie the whole Flock. Lio. O Friar, those are faults that are not seene, Ours open, and of worst example beene. They call ours, Pagan pastimes, that infect Our blood with ease, our youth with all neglect; Our tongues with wantonnesse, our thoughts with lust, And what they censure ill, all others must. Rob. I doe not know, what their sharpe sight may see Of late, but I should thinke it still might be (As 'twas) a happy age, when on the Plaines, The Wood-men met the Damsells, and the Swaines The Neat'ards, Plow-men, and the Pipers loud, And each did dance, some to the Kit, or Crowd, Some to the Bag-pipe, some the Tabret-mov'd, And all did either love, or were belov'd. Lio. The dextrous Shepherd then would try his sling, Then dart his Hooke at Daysies, then would sing. Sometimes would wrastle. Cla. I, and with a Lasse: And give her a new garment on the grasse; After a course at Barley-breake, or Base. Lio. And all these deeds were seene without offence, Or the least hazard o' their innocence. Rob. Those charitable times had no mistrust. Shepherds knew how to love, and not to lust. Cla. Each minute that wee lose thus, I confesse, Deserves a censure on us, more or lesse; But that a sadder chance hath given allay, Both to the Mirth, and Musicke of this day. Our fairest Shepherdesse wee had of late, Here upon Trent, is drown'd; for whom her mate Young Aeglamour, a Swaine, who best could tread Our countrey dances, and our games did lead, Lives like the melancholy Turtle, drown'd Deeper in woe, then she in water: crown'd With Yewgh and Cypressa, and will scarce admit The Physick of our presence to his fit. Lio. Sometimes he sits, and thinkes all day, then walkes, Then thinkes againe; and sighes, weeps, laughs, and talkes, And, 'twixt his pleasing frenzie, and sad griefe, Is so distracted; as no sought reliefe, By all our studies can procure his peace. Cla. The passion finds in him that large increase, As wee doubt hourely wee shall lose him too. Rob. You should not crosse him then what ere you doe: For Phant'sie stop'd, will soone take fire, and burne Into an anger, or to a Phrensie turne. Cla. Nay, so wee are advis'd by Alhen here, A good sage Shepherd, who all-tho' he weare An old worne hat and cloake, can tell us more Then all the forward Fry, that boast their Lore. Lio. See, yonder comes the brother of the Maid, Young Karolin! how curious, and afraid Hee is at once! willing to find him out, And loath to'offend him. Alken. Sure hee's here about. Scene V. Robin-hood. Clarion. Mellifleur. Lionel. Amie. Alken. Karolin. Aeglamour, sitting upon a banke by. Cla. See where hee sits. Aeg. It will be rare, rare, rare! An exquisite revenge: but peace, no words! Not for the fairest fleece of all the Flock: If it be knowne afore, 'tis all worth nothing! Ile carve it on the trees, and in the turfe, On every greene sworth, and in every path, Just to the Margin of the cruell Trent; There will I knock the story in the ground, In smooth great peble, and mosse fill it round, Till the whole Countrey read how she was drown'd, And with the plenty of salt teares there shed, Quite alter the complexion of the Spring. Or I will get some old, old Grandam, thither, Whose rigid foot but dip'd into the water, Shall strike that sharpe and suddaine cold, throughout, As it shall loose all vertue; and those Nimphs, Those treacherous Nimphs pull'd in Earine; Shall stand curl'd up, like Images of Ice; And never thaw! marke, never! a sharpe Justice: Or stay, a better! when the yeares at hottest, And that the Dog-starre fomes, and the streames boiles; And curles, and workes, and swells ready to sparkle: To fling a fellow with a Fever in, To set it all on fire, till it burne, Blew as Scamander, 'fore the walls of Troy; When Vulcan leap'd in to him, to consume him. Rob. A deepe hurt Phant'sie. Aeg. Doe you not approve it? Rob. Yes gentle Aeglamour wee all approve, And come to gratulate your just revenge: Which since it is so perfect, we now hope, You'l leave all care thereof, and mixe with us, In all the profer'd solace of the Spring. Aeg. A Spring, now she is dead: of what, of thornes? Briars, and Brambles? Thistles? Burs, and Dorks? Cold Hemlock? Yewgh? the Mandrake, or the Boxe? These may grow still; but what can spring beside? Did not the whole Earth sicken, when she died? As if there since did fall one drop of dew, But what was wept for her! or any stalke Did beare a Flower! or any branch a bloome; After her wreath was made: In faith, in faith You doe not faire, to put these things upon me. Which can in no sort be: Earine, Who had her very being, and her name, With the first knots, or buddings of the Spring, Borne with the Prim rose, and the Violet, Or earliest Roses blowne: when Cupid smil'd, And Venus led the Graces out to dance, And all the Flowers, and Sweets in Natures lap, Leap'd out, and made their solemne Conjuration, To last, but while shee liv'd: Doe not I know, How the Vale wither'd the same Day? How Dove, Deane, Eye, and Erwash, Idell, Snite, and Soare, Each broke his Vrne, and twenty waters more, That swell'd proud Trent, shrunke themselves dry; that since, No Sun, or Moone, or other cheerfull Starre Look'd out of heaven! but all the Cope was darke, As it were hung so for her Exequies! And not a voice or sound, to ring her knell: But of that dismall paire, the scritching Owle; And buzzing Hornet! harke, harke, harke the foule Bird! how shee flutters with her wicker wings! Peace you shall heare her scritch. Cla. Good Karolin sing. Helpe to divert this Phant'sie. Kar. All I can. The Song. Which while Karolin sings, Aeglamour reads. Though I am young, and cannot tell, Either what Death, or Love is well, Yet I have heard, they both beare darts, And both doe ayme at humane hearts: And then againe, I have beene told Love wounds with heart, as Death with cold; So that I feare, they doe but bring Extreames to touch, and meane one thing. As in a ruine, we it call One thing to be blowne up, or fall; Or to our end, like way may have, By a flash of lightning, or a wave: So Loves inflamed shaft, or brand, May kill as soone as Deaths cold hand; Except Loves fires the vertue have To fright the frost out of the grave. Aeg. Doe you thinke so? are you in that good heresie? I meane opinion? If you be, say nothing: I'll study it, as a new Philosophy, But by my selfe alone: Now you shall leave me! Some of these Nimphs, here will reward you; this This pretty Maid, although but with a kisse, Hee forces Amie to kisse him. Liv'd my Earine, you should have twenty: For every line here, one I would allow 'hem From mine owne store, the treasure I had in her: Now I am poore as you. Kar. And I a wretch! Cla. Yet keepe an eye upon him, Karoline. Mel. Alas that ever such a generous spirit, Aeglamour goes out, and Karolin followes him. As Aeglamours, should sinke by such a losse. Cla. The truest Lovers are least fortunate, Lookes all their Lives, and Legends; what they call The Lovers Scriptures: Heliodores, or Tatij! Longi! Eustathij! Prodomi! you'l find it! What thinke you Father? Alk. I have knowne some few, And read of more; wh'have had their dose, and deepe, Of these sharpe bitter-sweets. Lio. But what is this To jolly Robin? who the Story is, Of all beatitude in Love? Cla. And told Here every day, with wonder on the world. Lio. And with fames voice. Alk. Save that some folke delight To blend all good of others, with some spight. Cla. Hee, and his Marian, are the Summe and Talke Of all, that breath here in the Greene-wood Walke. Mel. Or Be'voir Vale? Kar. The Turtles of the Wood. Cla. The billing Paire. Alk. And so are understood For simple loves, and sampled lives beside. Mel. Faith, so much vertue should not be envi'd. Alk. Better be so, then pittied Mellifleur! For 'gainst all envy, vertue is a cure; But wretched pitty ever cals on scornes. The Deeres brought home: I heare it by their hornes. Scene VI. To Robin, &amp;c. Marian. Iohn. Scarlet. Scathlock. Rob. My Marian, and my Mistris! Mar. My lov'd Robin! Mel. The Moones at full, the happy paire are met! Mar. How hath this morning paid me, for my rising! First, with my sports; but most with meeting you! I did not halfe so so well reward my hounds, As she hath me to day: although I gave them All the sweet morsels, call'd Tongue, Eares, and Dowcets! Rob. What? and the inch-pin? Mar. Yes. Rob. Your sports then pleas'd you? Mar. You are a wanton. Rob. One I doe confesse I wanted till you came, but now I have you, Ile grow to your embraces, till two soules Distilled into kisses, through our lips Doe make one spirit of love. Mar. O Robin! Robin! Rob. Breathe, breathe a while, what sayes my gentle Marian? Mar. Could you so long be absent? Rob. What a weeke? Was that so long? Mar. How long are Lovers weekes! Doe you think Robin, when they are asunder? Are they not Pris'ners yeares? Rob. To some they seem so; But being met againe, they'are Schoole-boyes houres. Mar. That have got leave to play, and so wee use them. Rob. Had you good sport i'your chase to day? Io. O prime! Mar. A lusty Stagge? Rob. And hunted yee at force? Mar. In a full cry. Io. And never hunted change! Rob. You had stanch Hounds then? Mar. Old and sure, I love No young rash dogs, no more then changing friends. Rob. What relayes set you? Io. None at all; we laid not In one fresh dog. Rob. Hee stood not long then? Sca. Yes, Five houres and more. A great, large Deere! Rob. What head? Ioh. Forked! A Hart of ten. Mar. Hee is good Venison, According to the season i' the blood, I'll promise all your friends, for whom he fell. Ioh. But at his fall there hap't a chance. Mar. Worth marke? Rob. I! what was that sweet Marian He kisses her. Mar. You'll not heare? Rob. I love these interruptions in a Story; He kisses her againe. They make it sweeter. Mar. You doe know, as soone As the Assay is taken. He kisses her againe. Rob. On my Marian. I did but take the Assay. Mar. You stop ones mouth, And yet you bid 'hem speakeâwhen the Arbors made. Rob. Puld downe, and paunch turn'd out. Mar. Hee that undoes him; Doth cleave the brisket-bone, upon the spoone Of which, a little gristle growes, you call itâ Rob. the Ravens-bone. Mar. Now, ore head sate a Raven! On a sere bough! a growne great Bird! and Hoarse! Who, all the while the Deere was breaking up, So crok'd and cry'd for't, as all the hunts-men, (Especially old Scathlocke) thought it ominous! Swore it was Mother Maudlin; whom he met, At the Day-dawne; just as hee rows'd the Deere, Out of his Laire: but wee made shift to run him Off his foure leggs, and sunke him e're wee left. Is the Deere come? Scat. Hee lies within Ã´ the dresser! Mar. Will you goe see him Mellifleur? Mel. I attend you. Mar. Come Amie, you'll goe with us? Am. I am not well. Lio. Shee's sick o' the yong Shep'ard that bekist her. Mar. Friend, cheare your friends up, wee will eate him merrily. Alk. Saw you the Raven, Friend? Scat. I, qu'ha suld let me? I suld be afraid Ã´ you sir suld I? Clar. Hunts-man! A Dram more of Civilitie would not hurt you? Rob. Nay, you must give them all their rudenesses; They are not else themselves, without their language. Alk. And what do you thinke of her? Scat. As of a Witch. They call her a Wise-woman, but I thinke her An arrant Witch. Cla. And wherefore think you so? Sca. Because, I saw her since, broiling the bone Was cast her at the Quarrie. Alk. Where saw you her? Sca. I' the Chimley nuik, within: shee's there, now. Rob. Marian. Scene VII. To them Marian. Your Hunt holds in his tale, still; and tells more! Mar. My Hunt? what tale? Rob. How! cloudie, Marian! What looke is this? Mar. A fit one, Sir, for you. To Scathlock. Hand off rude Ranger! Sirrah, get you in And beare the Venison hence. It is too good For these course rustick mouthes that cannot open, Or spend a thanke for't. A starv'd Muttons carkasse Would better fit their palates. See it carried To Mother Maudlins, whom you call the Witch, Sir. Tell her I sent it to make merrie with, Shee'll turne us thanks at least! why stand'st thou, Groome? Rob. I wonder he can move! that hee's not fix'd! If that his feeling be the same with mine! I dare not trust the faith of mine owne senses. I feare mine eyes, and eares! this is not Marian! Nor am I Robin-hood! I pray you aske her! Aske her good Shep'ards! aske her all for me; Or rather aske your selves, if shee be shee; Or I, be I. Mar. Yes, and you are the spie: And the spi'd Spie, that watch upon my walkes, To informe what Deere I kill, or give away! Where! when! to whom! but spie your worst, good Spie! I will dispose of this where least you like! Fall to your cheese-cakes, curdes, and clawted creame, Your fooles, your flaunes; and of ale a streame To wash it from your livers: straine ewes milke Into your Cider sillabubs, and be drunke To him, whose Fleece hath brought the earliest Lambe This yeare; and weares the Baudrick at your bord! Where you may all goe whistle; and record This i' your dance: and foot it lustily. Shee leaves them. Rob. I pray you friends, doe you heare? and see, as I doe? Did the same accents strike your eares? and objects? Your eyes, as mine? Alk. Wee taste the same reproches! Lio. Have seen the changes! Rob. Are wee not all chang'd, Transformed from our selves? Lio. I do not know! The best is silence! Alk. And to await the issue. Rob. The dead, or lazie wait for't: I will find it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. II. The Argument of the second Act. The Witch Maudlin, having taken the shape of Marian to abuse Robin-hood, and perplexe his guests, commeth forth with her daughter Douce, reporting in what confusion shee hath left them; defrauded them, of their Venison; made them suspitious each of the other; but most of all Robin-hood so jealous of his Marian, as shee hopes no effect of love would ever reconcile them; glorying so farre in the extent of her mischiefe, as shee confesseth to have surpriz'd Earine, strip'd her of her garments, to make her daughter appeare fine, at this feast, in them; and to have shut the maiden up in a tree, as her sonnes prize, if he could winne her; or his prey, if he would force her. Her Sonne a rude bragging swine'ard, comes to the tree to woo her (his Mother, and Sister stepping aside, to over-heare him) and first boasts his wealth to her, and his possessions; which move not. Then he presents her guifts, such as himselfe is taken with, but shee utterly showes a scorne, and loathing both of him, and them. His mother is angry, rates him, instructs him what to doe the next time, and persuades her daughter, to show her selfe about the bower: tells, how shee shall know her mother, when she is transformed, by her broidered belt. Meane while the yong sheep'ardes Amy being kist by Karolin, Earines brother, before, falls in Love; but knowes not what Love is: but describes her disease so innocently, that Marian pitties her. When Robin-hood, and the rest of his Guests invited, enter to Marian, upbraiding her with sending away their Venison to Mother Maudlin by Scathlock, which shee denies; Scatchlock affirmes it, but seeing his Mistres weep, &amp; to forsweare it, begins to doubt his owne understanding, rather then affront her farder; which makes Robin-hood, and the rest, to examine themselves better. But Maudlin entering like her selfe, the Witch comes to thanke her for her bountie: at which, Marian is more angrie, and more denies the deed. Scathlock enters, tells he has brought it againe, &amp; delivered it to the Cooke. The Witch is inwardly vext, the Venison is so recover'd from her, by the rude Huntsman; and murmurs, and curses, bewitches the Cooke, mocks poore Amie, and the rest, discovereth her ill nature, and is a meane of reconciling them all. For the sage Shepherd, suspecteth her mischeife, if shee be not prevented: and so perswadeth to seize on her. Whereupon Robin-hood dispatcheth out his woodmen to hunt, and take her. which ends the Act. Scene. I. Maudlin. Douce. Mau. Have I not left 'em in a brave confusion? Amaz'd their expectation? got their Venison? Troubled their mirth, and meeting? made them doubtfull, And jealous of each other? all distracted? And, i' the close, uncertaine of themselves? This can your Mother doe my daintie Douce! Take anie shape upon her! and delude The senses, best acquainted with their Owners! The jolly Robin, who 'hath bid this feast, And made this solemne invitation; I ha' possessed so, with syke dislikes Of his owne Marian, that all-bee 'he know her, As doth the vauting hart, his venting hind, Hee nÃªre fra' hence, sall neis her i' the wind, To his first liking. Dou. Did you so distate him? Mau. As farre as her proud scorning him, could 'bate Or blunt the edge of any Lovers temper. Dou. But were yee like her mother? Mau. So like Douce, As had shee seen me her sel', her sel' had doubted Whether had been the liker off the twÃ¢! This can your Mother doe, I tell you Daughter! I ha' but dight yee, yet; i' the out-dresse; And 'parraile of Earine! but this raiment, These very weeds, fall make yee, as but comming In view or ken of Aeglamour, your forme Shall show too slipperie to be look'd upon! And all the Forrest sweare you to be shee! They shall rin after yee, and wage the odds, Upo' their owne deceived sights, yee' are her! Whilst shee (poore Lasse) is stock'd up in a tree: Your brother Lorells prize! For so my largesse, Hath lotted her, to be your brothers Mistresse; Gif shee can be reclaim'd: gif not, his Prey! And here he comes, new claithed, like a Prince Of Swine'ards! sike he seemes! dight i'the spoiles Of those he feedes! A mightie Lord of Swine! He is command now, to woo. Lets step aside, And heare his love-craft! See, he opes the dore! And takes her by the hand, and helpes her forth! This is true court-ship, and becomes his ray. Scene II. Lorel. Earine. Maudlin.

Bid mee, and I will Straight play to you, and make you melodie. Ear. By no meanes. Ah! to me all minstrelsie Is irksome, as are you. Lor. Why scorne you mee? He drawes out other presents. Because I am a Heards-man, and feed Swine! I am a Lord of other geere! this fine Smooth Bawsons Cub, the young Grice of a Gray; Twa tynie Urshins, and this Ferret gay. Ear.

A Gypsan Ladie, and a right Beldame, Wrought it by Moone-shine for mee, and Star-light, Upo' your Granams grave, that verie night Wee earth'd her, in the shades; when our Dame Hecat, Made it her gaing-night, over the Kirk-yard, Withall the barke and parish tykes set at her, While I sate whyrland, of my brasen spindle: At every twisted thrid my rock let flie Unto the sew'ster, who did sit me nigh, Under the towne-turne-pike; which ran each spell She stitched in the worke, and knit it well. See, yee take tent to this, and ken 'your Mother. Scene IV. Marian. Mellifleur. Amie. Mar. How do you sweet Amie? yet? Mel. Shee cannot tell, If shee could sleepe, shee saies, shee should do well. Shee feeles a hurt, but where, shee cannot show Any least signe, that shee is hurt or no. Her paine's not doubtfull to her; but the seat Of her paine is. Her thoughts too work, and beat, Opprest with Cares: but why, shee cannot say. All matter of her care is quite away. Mar. Hath any Vermin broke into your Fold? Or any rott seiz'd on your flock? or cold? Or hath your feighting Ram, burst his hard horne? Or any Ewe her fleece? or bag hath torne, My gentle Amie? Am. Marian, none of these. Mar. Ha' you been stung by Waspes, or angry Bees? Or raz'd with some rude bramble, or rough briar? Am. No Marian; my disease is somewhat nigher. I weep, and boile away my Selfe, in teares; And then my panting heart would dry those feares: I burne, though all the Forrest lend a shade; And freize, though the whole Wood one fire were made. Mar. Alas! Am. I often have been torne with thorne and briar; Both in the Leg, and Foot, and somewhat higher: Yet gave not then such fearfull shreikes as these. Ah! I often have been stung too, with curst Bees, Yet no remember that I then did quit Either my Companie, or Mirth for it. Ah! And therefore, what it is that I feele now, And know no cause of it, nor where, nor how, It entred in mee, nor least print can see, I feele afflicts mee more, then Briar, or Bee. Oh! How often, when the Sun heavens brightest birth Hath with his burning fervour cleft the earth, Under a spreading Elme, or Oake, hard by A coole cleare fountaine, could I sleeping lie Safe from the heate? but now, no shadie tree, Nor purling brook, can my refreshing bee? Oft when the medowes, were growne rough with frost, The rivers ice-bound, and their currents lost, My thick warme fleece I wore, was my defence Or large good fires, I made, drave winter thence. But now, my whole flocks fells, nor this thick grove, Enflam'd to ashes, can my cold remove. It is a cold, and heat, that doth out goe All sense of Winters, and of Summers so. Scene V. Robin-hood. Clarion. Lionel. Alken. Rob. O', are you here, my Mistresse? Mar. I my Love! Shee seing him, runs to imbrace him. He puts her back. Where should I be, but in my Robins armes? The Sphere which I delight in, so to move? Rob. What the rude Ranger? and spied Spie? hand off: You are for no such rusticks. Mar. What meanes this, Thrice worthy Clarion? or wise Alken? know yee? Rob. 'Las no, not they! a poore sterv'd Muttons carkasse Would better fit their palat's, then your Venison. Mar. What riddle is this! unfold your selfe, deare Robin. Rob. You ha' not sent your Venison hence by Scathlock, To Mother Maudlin? Mar. I to Mother Maudlin? Will Scathlock say so? Rob. Nay, wee will all sweare so. For all did heare it, when you gave the charge so. Both Clarion, Alken, Lionel, my selfe. Mar. Good honest Shep'ards, Masters of your flocks, Simple, and vertuous men, no others hirelings; Be not you made to speake against your Conscience, That which may soile the truth. I send the Venison Away? by Scathlock? and to mother Maudlin? I came to shew it here, to Mellifleur, I doe confesse; but Amies falling ill, Did put us of it: Since wee imploied our selves Scathlock, enters. In comforting of her. O', here he is! Did I, Sir, bid you beare away the Venison, To mother Maudlin? Sca. I gud faith, Madam, Did you, and I ha' done it. Mar. What ha' you done? Sca. Obey'd your hests, Madam; done your Commaunds. Mar. Done my Commaunds, dull groome? Fetch it againe Or kennel with the hounds. Are these the Arts Robin, you read your rude ones o' the wood, To countenance your quarrells, and mistakings? Or are the sports to entertaine your friends Those formed jealousies? Aske of Mellifleur, If I were ever from her, here, or Amie, Since I came in with them; or saw this Scathlock, Since I related to you his tale, o' the Raven? Scathlock goes out. Sca. I, say you so? Mel. Shee never left my side Since I came in, here, nor I hers. Cla. This 's strange! Our best of Senses were deceiv'd, our eyes, then! Lio. And eares too. Mar. What you have concluded on, Make good I pray you. Am. O' my heart, my heart! Mar. My heart it is, is wounded prettie Amie; Report not you your greifes: I'll tell for all. Mel. Some body is to blame, there is a fault. Mar. Try if you can take rest. A little slumber Will much refresh you (Amie). Alk. What's her greif? Mar. Shee does not know: and therein shee is happie. Scene VI. To them John, Maudlin, and Scathlock after. Joh. Here's Mother Maudlin come to give you thanks, Madam, for some late guift, shee hath receiv'dâ Which shee's not worthie of, shee saies, but crakes, And wonders of it; hoppes about the house; Transported with the joy. Shee daunceth. Mau. Send mee a Stagge! A whole Stagge, Madam! and so fat a Deere! So fairelie hunted, and at such a time too! When all your freinds were here! Rob. Do you mark this, Clarion? Her owne acknowledgement? Mau. 'Twas such a bountie And honour done to your poore Bedes-woman, I know not how to owe it, but to thanke you. And that I come to du: I shall goe round, And giddie with the toy of the good turne. Shee turnes round, till shee falls. Looke out, looke out, gay folke about, And see mee spin; the ring I' am in Of mirth, &amp; glee, with thanks for fee The heart putts on, for th'Venison My Lady sent, which shall be spent In draughts of Wine, to fume up fine Into the braine, and downe againe Fall in a Swoune, and upo' the growne. Rob. Look to her, shee is mad. Mau. My Son hath sent you A pott of Strawberries, gather'd i' the wood (His Hoggs would els have rooted up, or trod) With a choice dish of wildings here, to scald And mingle with your Creame. Mar. Thank you good Maudlin, And thanke your Sonne. Go, beare 'hem in to Much Th'Acater, let him thanke her. Surelie, Mother You were mistaken, or my Woodmen more, Or most my selfe, to send you all our store Of Venison, hunted for our selves, this day! You will not take it, Mother I dare say, If wee'lld intreat you; when you know our ghests: Red Deere is head still of the forrest feasts. Mau. But I knaw yee, a right free-hearted Ladie, Can spare it out of superfluitie: I have departit it 'mong my poore Neighbours To speake your Largesse. Mar. I not gave it, Mother; You have done wrong then: I know how to place My guifts, and where; and when to find my seasons To give, not throw away my Curtesies. Mau. Count you this thrown away? Mar. What's ravish'd from mee I count it worse; as stolne: I loose my thanks. But leave this quest: they fit not you, nor mee, Maudlin, Contentions of this qualitie. How now? Sca. Your Stag's return'd upon my shoulders, Scathlock enters. Hee has found his way into the Kitchin againe: With his two Leggs, If now your Cooke can dresse him; Slid, I thought the Swine'ard would ha' beat mee, Hee lookes so big! the sturdie Karle, lewd Lorel! Mar. There Scathlock, for thy paines, thou hast deserv'd it. Marian gives him Gold. Mau. Do you give a thing, and take a thing, Madam? Mar. No, Maudlin, you had imparted to your Neighbours; As much good doo't them: I ha' done no wrong. Mau. The Spit stand still, no Broches turne Before the fire, but let it burne The first Charme. Both sides, and haunches, 'till the whole Converted be into one Cole. Cla. What Devills Pater noster mumbles shee? Alk. Stay, you will heare more of her witcherie Mau. The Swill and Dropsie enter in The Lazie Cuke, and swell his skin; 2. And the old Mort-malon his shin Now prick, and itch, withouten blin. Cla. Speake out Hagge, wee may heare your Devills Mattens. Mau. The PÃ¦ne, wee call S. Antons fire 3. The Gout, or what wee can desire, To crampe a Cuke, in every lim, Before they dine, yet; seize on him. Alk. A foule ill Spirit hath possessed her. Am. O Karol, Karol, call him back againe. Lio. Her thoughts do worke upon her, in her slumber. And may expresse some part of her disease. Rob. Observe, and marke, but trouble not her ease. Am. O', Ã´. Mar. How is't Amie? Mel. Wherfore start you? Am. O' Karol, he is faire, and sweet. Mau. What then? Are there not flowers as sweet, as faire, as men? The Lillie is faire! and Rose is sweet! Am. I', so! Let all the Roses, and the Lillies goe: Karol is only faire to mee! Mar. And why? Am. Alas for Karol, Marian, I could die. Karol. He singeth sweetly too! Mau. What then? Are there not Birds sing sweeter farre, then Men? Am. I grant the Linet, Larke, and Bul-finch sing, But best, the deare, good Angell of the Spring, The Nightingale. Mau. Then why? then why, alone, Should his notes please you? Am. I not long agone Tooke a delight, with wanton kidds to play, And sport with little Lambes a Summers Day! And view their friskes! me thought it was a sight Of joy, to see my two brave Rammes to fight! Now Karol, onely, all delight doth move! All that is Karol, Karol I approve! This verie morning, butâ(I did bestow (It was a little' gainst my will, I know) A single kisse, upon the seelie Swaine, And now I wish that verie kisse againe. His lip is softer, sweeter then the Rose His mouth, and tongue with dropping honey flowes. The relish of it was a pleasing thing. Mau. Yet like the Bees it had a little sting. Am. And sunke, and sticks yet in my marrow deepe And what doth hurt me, I now wish to keepe. Mar. Alas, how innocent her Storie is! Am. I doe remember, Marian, I have oft With pleasure kist my Lambes, and Puppies, soft, And once a daintie fine Roe-fawne I had, Of whose out-skipping bounds, I was as glad As of my health: and him I oft would kisse: Yet had his, no such sting, or paine, as this. They never prick't or hurt my heart. And, for They were so blunt, and dull, I wish no more. But this, that hurtes, and prickes doth please; This sweet, Mingled with sower, I wish againe to meet: And that delay, mee thinks, most tedious is That keepes, or hinders mee of Karols kisse. Mar. Wee'll send for him sweet Amie, to come to you. She goes murmuring out. Mau. But, I will keepe him of if Charmes will doe it. Cla. Doe you marke the murmuring hagge, how shee doth mutter? Rob. I like her not. And lesse her manners now. Alk. Shee is a shrewd deformed peice, I vow. Lio. As crooked as her bodie. Rob. I beleeve Shee can take any Shape; as Scathlock saies. Alk. Shee may deceive the Sense, but really Shee cannot change her selfe. Rob. Would I could see her, Once more in Marians forme! for I am certaine Now, it was shee abus'd us; as I think My Marian, and my Love, now, innocent: Which faith I seale unto her, with this kisse, And call you all to witnesse of my pennance. Alk. It was beleiv'd before, but now confirm'd, That wee have seen the Monster. Scene VII. To them Tuck. John. Much. Scarlet. Tuc. Heare you how Poore Tom, the Cooke, is taken! All his joynts Do crack, as if his Limbes were tied with points: His whole frame slackens; and a kind of rack Runs downe along the Spondylls of his back; A Gowt, or Crampe, now seizeth on his head, Then falls into his feet; his knees are lead; And he can stirre his either hand, no more Then a dead stumpe, to his office, as before. Alk. Hee is bewitched. Cla. This is an Argument Both of her malice, and her power, wee see. Alk. Shee must by some device restrained bee, Or shee'll goe farre in mischiefe. Rob. Advise how, Sage Shep'ard, wee shall put it straight in practice. Alk. Send forth your woodmen, then, into the walkes, Or let 'em prick her footing hence; A Witch Is sure a Creature of Melancholy, And will be found, or sitting in her fourme, Or els, at releife, like a Hare. Cla. You speake Alken, as if you knew the sport of Witch-hunting, Enter George to the Huntsmen; who by themselves continue the Scene. The rest going off. Or starting of a Hag. Rob. Go sirs about it, Take George here with you, he can helpe to find her; Leave Tuck, and Much behind to dresse the Dinner, I' the Cookes stead. Much. Wee'll care to get that done. Rob. Come Marian, lets withdraw into the bowre. Scene VIII. John. Scarlet. Scathlock. George. Alken. Jo. Rare sport I sweare! this hunting of the Witch Will make us. Scar. Let's advise upon't, like huntsmen. Geo. And wee can spie her once, shee is our owne. Sca. First, think which way shee fourmeth, on what wind: Or North, or South. Geo. For, as the Shep'ard said, A Witch is a kind of Hare. Scat. And markes the weather, As the hare does. Jo. Where shall wee hope to find her? Alken returnes. Alk. I have ask'd leave to assist you, jollie huntsmen, If an old Shep'herd may be heard among you; Not jear'd or laugh'd at. Jo. Father, you will see Robin-hoods house-hold, know more Curtesie. Scat. Who scornes at eld, peeles of his owne young haires. Alk. Yee say right well. Know yee the Witches Dell? Scar. No more then I do know the walkes of Hell. Alk. Within a gloomie dimble, shee doth dwell Downe in a pitt, ore-growne with brakes and briars. Close by the ruines of a shaken Abbey Torne, with an Earth-quake, down unto the ground, 'Mongst graves, and grotts, neare an old Charnell house, Where you shall find her sitting in her fourme, As fearfull, and melancholique, as that Shee is about; with Caterpillers kells And knottie Cobwebs, rounded in with spells; Thence shee steales forth to releif, in the foggs, And rotten Mistes, upon the fens, and boggs, Downe to the drowned Lands of Lincolneshire; To make Ewes cast their Lambs! Swine eate their Farrow! The House-wifes Tun not worke! Nor the Milk churne! Writhe Childrens wrists! and suck their breath in sleepe! Get Vialls of their blood! And where the Sea Casts up his slimie Owze, search for a weed To open locks with, and to rivet Charmes, Planted about her, in the wicked feat, Of all her mischiefes, which are manifold. Jo. I wonder such a storie could be told, Of her dire deeds. Geo. I thought a Witches bankes Had inclos'd nothing, but the merrie prankes Of some old woman. Skar. Yes, her malice more! Sca. As it would quickly appeare, had wee the Store Of his Collects. Geo. I, this gud learned Man Can speake her right. Skar. He knowes, her shifts, and haunts! Alk. And all her wiles, and turnes. The venom'd Plants Where with shee kill's! where the sad Mandrake growes, Whose grones are deathfull! the dead-numming Night-shade! The stupifying Hemlock! Adders tongue! And Martagan! the shreikes of lucklesse Owles, Wee heare! and croaking Night-Crowes in the aire! Greene-bellied Snakes! blew fire-drakes in the skie! And giddie Flitter-mice, with lether wings! The scalie Beetles, with their habergeons, That make a humming Murmur as they flie! There, in the stocks of trees, white Faies doe dwell, And span-long Elves, that dance about a poole! With each a little Changeling, in their armes! The airie spirits play with falling starres! And mount the Sphere of fire, to kisse the Moone! While, shee fitts reading by the Glow-wormes light, Or rotten wood (o're which the worme hath crept) The banefull scedule of her nocent charmes, And binding Characters, through which shee wounds Her Puppetts, the Sigilla of her witch-craft. All this I know, and I will find her for you; And shew you'her sitting in her fourme; I'le lay My hand upon her; make her throw her skutt Along her back, when shee doth start before us. But you must give her Law: and you shall see her Make twentie leapes, and doubles; crosse the pathes, And then squatt downe beside us. Jo. Craftie Croane! I long to be at the sport, and to report it. Scar. Wee'll make this hunting of the Witch, as famous, As any other blast of Venerie. Scat. Hang her foule hagge, shee'll be a stinking Chase! I had rather ha' the hunting of heir heyre. Geo. If wee could come to see her, cry, so haw, once! Alk. That I doe promise, or I'am no good Hag-finder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. The Argument of the third Act. Puck-hairy discovers himselfe in the Forrest, and discourseth his offices with their necessities, breifly; After which, Douce, entring in the habit of Earine, is pursued by Karol; who mistaking her at first to be his Sister, questions her, how shee came by those garments. Shee answers, by her mothers gift. The sad Shepherd comming in the while, shee runs away affrighted, and leaves Karol, sodainely; Aeglamour thinking it to be Earines ghost he saw, falls into a melancholique expression of his phantsie to Karol, &amp; questions him sadly about that point, which moves compassion in Karol of his mistake still. When Clarion, and Lionell enter to call Karol to Amie; Karol reports to them Aeglamours passion, with much regreet. Clarion resolves to seeke him. Karol to returne with Lionell. By the way Douce, and her Mother (in the shape of Marian) meet them, and would divert them, affirming Amie to be recovered, which Lionell wondred at to be so soone. Robin-hood enters, they tell him the relation of the Witch, thinking her to be Marian; Robin suspecting her to be Maudlin, lay's hold of her Girdle sodainely, but shee striving to get free, they both run out, and he returnes with the belt broken. Shee following in her owne shape, demaunding it, but at a distance, as fearing to be seiz'd upon againe; and seeing shee cannot recover it, falls into a rage, and cursing, resolving to trust to her old artes, which shee calls her daughter to assist in. The Shepherds content with this discovery, goe home triumphing, make the relation to Marian. Amie is gladded with the sight of Karol, &amp;c. In the meane time enters Lorel, with purpose to ravish Earine, and calling her forth to that lewd end, he by the hearing of Clarions footing, is staid, and forced to commit her hastily to the tree againe, where Clarion comming by, and hearing a voyce singing, drawes neere unto it, but Aeglamour hearing it also, and knowing it to be Earine's, falls into a superstitious commendation of it, as being an Angells, and in the aire, when Clarion espies a hand put forth from the tree, and makes towards it, leaving Aeglamour to his wild phantsie, who quitteth the place, and Clarion beginning to court the hand, and make love to it, there ariseth a mist sodainely, which, darkning all the place, Clarion looseth himselfe, and the tree where Earine is inclosed, lamenting his misfortune, with the unknowne nimphs miserie. The Aire clearing, enters the Witch, with her Son and Daughter, tells them how shee had caused that late darkenesse, to free Lorell from surprisall, and his prey from being reskued from him: bids him looke to her, and lock her up more carefully, and follow her, to assist a work, shee hath in hand, of recovering her lost Girdle; which shee laments the losse of, with cursings, execrations, wishing confusion to their feast, and meeting: sends her Sonne, and Daughter to gather certaine Simples, for her purpose, and bring them to her Dell. This Puck hearing prevents, &amp; shewes her error still. The Hunts-men having found her footing, follow the tract, and prick after her. Shee getts to her Dell, and takes her Forme. Enter, Alken has spied her sitting with her Spindle, Threds, and Images. They are eager to seize her presently, but Alken perswades them to let her begin her charmes, which they doe. Her Sonne and Daughter come to her, the Hunts-men are afrighted as they see her worke goe forward. And over-hastie to apprehend her, shee escapeth them all, by the helpe and delusions of Puck. Scene I. Puck-hairy. The Feind hath much to doe, that keepes a Schoole; Or is the Father of a familie; Or governes but a country Academie: His labours must be great, as are his cares, To watch all turnes, and cast how to prevent 'hem. This Dame of mine here, Maud. growes high in evill, And thinkes shee doe's all, when 'tis I, her Divell, That both delude her, and must yet protect her: Shee's confident in mischeife, and presumes The changing of her shape will still secure her. But that may faile, and diverse hazards meete Of other consequence, which I must looke to. Not let her be surpriz'd on the first catch. I must goe daunce about the Forrest, now, And firke it like a Goblin, till I find her. Then will my service come worth acceptation; When not expected of her, when the helpe Meetes the necessity, and both doe kisse 'Tis call'd the timing of a dutie, this. Scene II. Karol. Douce, to them Aeglamour. Kar. Sure, you are very like her! I conceiv'd You had been shee, seeing you run afore mee: For such a suite shee made her 'gainst this Feast; In all resemblance, or the verie same; I saw her in it; had shee liv'd t'enjoy it Shee had been there an acceptable Guest To Marian, and the gentle Robin-hood, Who are the Crowne, and Ghirland of the Wood. Dou. I cannot tell: my Mother gave it mee, And bad mee weare it. Kar. Who, the wise good Woman? Old Maud. of Pappelwicke? Dou. Yes, this sullen Man. I cannot like him. I must take my leave Aeglamour enters, and Douce goes out. Aeg. What said shee to you? Kar. Who? Aegl. Earine, I saw her talking with you, or her Ghost; For shee indeed is drown'd in old Trents bottome. Did shee not tell who would ha' pull'd her in? And had her Maiden-head upon the place? The rivers brim, the margin of the Flood? No ground is holie enough, (you know my meaning) Lust is committed in Kings Palaces, And yet their Majesties not violated! No words! Car. How sad, and wild his thoughts are! gone? Aeglamour goes out, but comes in againe. Aeg. But shee, as chaste, as was her name, Earine, Dy'd underflowr'd: and now her sweet soule hovers, Here, in the Aire, above us; and doth haste To get up to the Moone, and Mercury; And whisper Venus in her Orbe; then spring Up to old Saturne, and come downe by Mars, Consulting Jupiter; and seate her selfe Just in the midst with PhÅbus; tempring all The jarring Spheeres, and giving to the World Againe, his first and tunefull planetting! O' what an age will here be of new concords! Delightfull harmonie! to rock old Sages, Twice infants, in the Cradle o' Speculation, He goes out againe, but returnes as soone as before. And throw a silence upon all the creatures! Kar. A Cogitation of the highest rapture! Aegl. The loudest Seas, and most enraged Windes Shall lose their clangor; Tempest shall grow hoarse; Loud Thunder dumbe; and every speece of storme Laid in the lap of listning Nature, husht; To heare the changed chime of this eighth spheere! Take tent, and harken for it, loose it not. Aeglamour departs. Scene III. Clarion. Lionell. Karol. Cla. O', here is Karol! was not that the sad Shep'erd, slip'd from him? Lio. Yes, I ghesse it was: Who was that left you, Karol? Kar. The last man! Whom, wee shall never see himselfe againe; Or ours, I feare! He starts away from hand, so, And all the touches, or soft stroke of reason! Yee can applie. No Colt is so unbroken! Or hawke yet halfe so haggard, or unmann'd! He takes all toies that his wild phantsy proffers, And flies away with them. He now conceives That my lost Sister, his Earine, Is lately turn'd a Sphere amid the seven: And reades a Musique-Lecture to the Planets; And with this thought, hee's run to cal 'hem, Hearers! Cla. Alas, this is a strayn'd, but innocent phant'sie! I'le follow him, and find him, if I can: Meane time, goe you with Lionell, sweet Karol, Hee will acquaint you with an accident Which much desires your presence, on the place! Scene IV. Karol. Lionell. Kar. What is it, Lionell, wherein I may serve you? Why doe you so survey, and circumscribe mee? As if you stuck one Eye into my brest, And with the other took my whole dimensions? Lio. I wish you had a windo' i' your bosome Or i your back: I might look thorough you, And see your in-parts, Karol, liver, heart; For there the seat of Love is. Whence the Boy (The winged Archer) hath shott home a shaft Into my sisters brest, the innocent Amie, Who now cries out, upon her bed, on Karol, Sweet singing Karol! the delicious Karol! That kist her like a Cupid! In your eyes, Shee saies, his stand is! and between your lipp's He runs forth his divisions, to her eares, But will not bide there, 'lesse your selfe do bring him. Goe with me Karol, and bestow a visit In charitie, upon the afflicted Maid, Who pineth with the languor of your love. Mar. Whither intend you? Amy is recover'd, To them Maud and Douce, but Maud appearing like Marian. Feeles no such griefe as shee complain'd of, lately: This Maiden hath been with her from her Mother Maudlin, the cunning Woman, who hath sent her Herbes for her head, and Simples of that nature, Have wrought upon her a miraculous Cure; Setled her braine, to all our wish, and wonder! Lio. So instantly? you know, I now but left her, Possess'd with such a fit, almost to'a phrensie; Your selfe too fear'd her, Marian; and did urge My haste, to seeke out Karol, and to bring him. Mar. I did so. But the skill of that wise woeman And her great charitie of doeing good Hath by the readie hand of this deft lasse Her daughter, wrought effects, beyond beleife, And to astonishment; wee can but thanke And praise, and be amazed, while wee tell it. They goe out. Lio. 'Tis strange, that any art should so helpe nature In her extremes. Kar. Then, it appeares most reall When th'other is deficient. Rob. Wherefore, stay you Enter Robin-hood Discoursing here, and haste not with your succours To poore afflicted Amie, that so needes them? Lio. Shee is recover'd well, your Marian told us But now here: See, shee is return'd t'affirme it! Enter Maudl: like Marian. Maudl: espying Robin-hood would run out, but he staies her by the Girdle, and runs in with her. Her returnes with the Girdle broken, and shee in her owne shape. Rob. My Marian? Mar. Robin-hood? Is hee here? Rob. Stay! What was't you ha' told my friend? Mar. Helpe, murder, helpe. You will not rob me Out-law? Theife, restore My belt that yee have broken! Rob. Yes, come neere, Mau. Not i' your gripe. Rob. Was this the charmed circle? The Copy that so couzen'd, and deceiv'd us? I'le carry hence the trophie of your spoiles. My men shall hunt you too upon the start, And course you soundly. Mau. I shall make 'hem sport And send some home, without their leggs, or armes. I'le teach 'hem to climbe Stiles, leape Ditches, Ponds, And lie i'the Waters, if they follow mee. Rob. Out murmuring Hagge. Mau. I must use all my powers, Lay all my witts to piecing of this losse. Things run unluckily, Where's my Puck-hairy? Scene V. Maud. Puck. [Mau.] Hath he forsooke mee? Puc. At your beck, Madame. Mau. O Puck, my Goblin! I have lost my belt, The strong theife, Robin Out-law, forc'd it from mee. Puck. They are other Cloudes and blacker threat you, Dame; You must be wary, and pull in your sailes, And yeeld unto the wether of the tempest. You thinke your power's infinite as your malice; And would do all your anger prompts you to: But you must wait occasions, and obey them: Saile in an egg-shell, make a straw your mast, A Cobweb all your Cloth, and passe, unseen, Till you have scap'd the rockes that are about you. Mau. What rock's about mee? Puc. I do love, Madam, To shew you all your dangers, when you are past 'hem. Come, follow mee, I'll once more be your pilot, And you shall thanke mee. Mau. Lucky, my lov'd Goblin! Where are you gaang, now? Lor. Unto my tree, Lorel meetes her. To see my Maistres. Mau. Gang thy gait, and try Thy turnes, with better luck, or hang thy sel'. The End.</field>
