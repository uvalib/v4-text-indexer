      <field name="fulltext">THE ACTORS. Nero Cesar, Emperor of Rome. Agrippa, King of Jewry: Vespatian Nero's Gen: &amp; after Emp: Titus Son to Vespatian. Ualerio A Roman Captain: Nicanor A Roman Captain: Ananias High Priest for Ierusalem: Gorion Priest, Joseph Son to Gorion and Captain of the Iews, Eleazer Seditious Captain of the Jews, Iehochanan Seditious Captain of the Jews, Simeon Seditious Captain of the Jews, Zareck A poor Iew, Miriam A Iewish Lady, Peter The Ladies man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologus. Iudicious friends, our Author bids me say, That he hath labour'd to adorn his Play With such Varieties; as may befit The fair deportment of a sober wit. Stories are strict, and challenge from the Stage, The true Dimensions of their former Age: Where Fancy guides the Plot, the Field is wide, And freely grants what here will be deni'd; What's wanting to his will by this defect, Your gentle Censures, and more milde aspect Will fairly answer; Grant him this, and he Will study to deserve your Curtesie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. Scene I. Sound Musicke, and enter NERO, Emperour of Rome, Crown'd with a Lawrel Wreath; and attended by Roman Lords, he ascends his Chair of state. NERO. My Lords of Rome, since first the auspicious eye Of Heaven look't singly on our bold attempts, We ne'r incounter'd fortunes so advers, Since first our Father Romulus ordain'd The Eternal Fire, by vestal Nunns preserv'd; And since Religious Numa did create Our Holy Sacrifices for the Gods, We never had such signes prodigious; Our Bulls for Offerings to the God of War Fall dead untoucht by hand of Holy Priest; And such as wounded dye by sacred Knife, Their Intrails spotted tells us all's not well, The Gods are sure displeas'd. 1. Lord. Our War, my Soveraign, can import no less, The Persians, Grecians, and the Galls revolts, With ill success in Jewry, these can tell Most mighty Cesar, that all is not well. Nero. Now by the Gods I swear, That sturdy Nation shall repent their pride. Have we not sent Embassadors from Rome To treat them fair, and to confirm our Truce? Have we not sent a Bull for sacrifice? And Sheep for offerings of a sacred Peace, Even to the God himself whom they adore, And in his Temple too? What could we more? Save what we did, to give our Royal Word, That never henceforth Roman Prince Should rule the Nation, but a Native born, Even their own King Agrippa. Hear'st thou not yet of his arrival? 2 Lord. Our packets do inform us of his neer approach, Each hour he is expected. Nero. By heaven I thirst to know the certainty of their proceedings. Nor can I chuse but wonder at the stay of our Vespatian, I fear all is not well with him my Lords: Haste thee Hostilius to the sacred Priests, Exit a messenger. Bid them again go offer sacrifice, I long to see some luckie signs appear. Shout within. Go know the reason of that shout, Exit a Lord. The cheerful noyse should seem to speak of joy. Lord. The King of Iewry is at hand my Lord. Enters agen. Nero. Now by my life he's welcom: go forth &amp; meet him. And conduct him to our presence. Exit agen. Lord. I shall my lord. Nero. Now have we half our wish; were but Vespatian here We had our full desire. A Florish, and enter King Agrippa; two of his Attendants go before him, bearing his Crown between them, with other folowers; those that bear the crown kneel before the Emperor. K. Agrip. Thus lowe great CÃ¦sar to thy Majestie Bowes Iurges King to do thee fealtie. Nero. And thus lowe CÃ¦sar steps to bid thee welcom; Welcom Agrippa; take from CÃ¦sars hand Thy sacred Diadem, with sole command Hee puts the Crown upon him, &amp; sets him by him. Of thy rebellious Jews. But tel me K. Agrippa, where are those Embassadors of mine, which lately were Dispatch't with presents to thy Nation, With sacred offrings, and with flags of peace Embrac't with solemn joy, and safely stowde Within our Temple; thy Embassage done With due regards to Romes and Iewrits honor: But loe the fury of a frantick mind, The factious Commons in their heat of blood Have slain thy Roman Lords, &amp; stoutly stand Rebellious Captains of our holy Land. Nero. What! Agrip. Tis true great Emperor, nor was my self secure, But forc't to flie for safety. Nero. Is't possible? O ye gods! Rises and goes down. To what a wretched time am I reserv'd, That this smal handful dares affront me thus? Where art thou Iulius? at whose great command The utmost ends of Europe did obey. Where worthy Alexander? that didst sweat to dwel Within the circuit of this little Earth: Behold a wretched caitiff in your room, Contend, despis'd, rebel'd against; O ye gods! what more; Not able to maintain what you have won. Lord. Most mighty CÃ¦sar, Let not thy passion rob thee of thy right; Let CÃ¦sar be himself, and then heel see Himself as great in pow'r, &amp; greater in degrees of soveraignty. Nero. Away thou fawning Cur, upon my life thou flatterst me. Lord. My Lord? Nero. No more I say. But laugh me to scorn behind my back, And yet, though I deserve it, take heed thou dost it not, Upon thy life take heed; look too'tâ Agrip. Great Soveraign, give Agrippa leave to speak, Thou canst not Mighty CÃ¦sar, now behold Thy self, nor others, with a judging eye; Recall thy self from passion; and be still As great in Powre, as thou art great in Will. Nero. Thou gav'st the wound Agrippa, and hast heal'd it; But yet the loss of my Embassadors was strange; 'tvvas vvonderous strange, And wonderous daring too; Daring to me; to me I say twas daring. Agrip. No more, most mighty CÃ¦sar. Nero. Well, I have done, pardon my hast Agrippa; And you, forget what I have said. Nero. The News. A shout within, &amp; enter a messenger. Messen. My gracious Lord Vespatian is arriv'd, And Prays admittance to your royal presence. Nero. Vespatian come? Thou bringst us happy news; Exit a messenger. Conduct him hither strait; we long to hear welcom nevvs. He ascends his chair with King Agrippa. Enter Vespatian with other Roman Lords. Vesp. All happiness attend imperious CÃ¦sar: Peace from the Gods; from Europe victory; And from Vespatian duty to the King. Nero. Welcom Vespatian; the Gods are pleas'd indeed, raises him. Since with thy Victors brow we crowned stand; Glad yet our ears more with a true and full relation Of thy successful voyage. Vesp. From vanquisht Persia, mighty CÃ¦sar, we Were by stresse of weather forc't to touch Vpon the Coasts of Spain; there we renew'd Our weather beaten Barks with fresh supply Of men and Amunition: Thence we stear'd Our course for Gallia and the Britains shore. The Gauls at our arrival bad declare What our intentions, whom, and whence we were We answer'd, [Mighty CÃ¦sar] we were come To claim obedience to the Roman yoke The haughty King deny'd, and stoutly stood In bold defiance. Long was the dreadful fight, and doubtful too, Till at the length thy souldiers won the day, And forc't their stubborn King in spight obey. From thence great King we steer'd to Britains shore, Where we were entertain'd as was of old Our famous Iulius, with a dreadful noise Of hiddeous outcries, shreeks, and yellings out To fright our Souldiers, while themselves made good Their craggy Clifts with loss of Brittish blood: Thrice were we beaten of, and thrice again Recover'd footing: yet still great King were forc'd To give them ground till thy Vespatian cry'd, Fight, fight on your honour, lives, and CÃ¦sars side, For mighty CÃ¦sar fight. Hadst thou but seen, great King, thy Captains then, And Roman Lords come bleeding on again, Repulse the Foe, and bravely win the shore, Maintain the Onsent still, tho still oppos'd, Till Chariot waves were drown'd in Brittish blood, There hadst thou seen their ranks with fury broke, and them subjected to thy sole command. This Mighty CÃ¦sar is the brief of all Since thy Commission made me General: Nero. Blest be the gods, Vespatian, and be thou Blest in the favour of our gracious Brow. And now again thrice welcom worthy Roman, Thy valor shall be crown'd with full reward Of fair preferment worthy thy deserts: We therefore here create thee General Of all Iudea and the Holy Land. O my Vespatian! I can tell thee stories Will spurre thee on in fury to revenge. But nowi no more of thatâ We will to triumph for our victories; That done, set ope the Gates of Ianus wide, That bloody war may quel Judea's pride. Exeunt omnes. ScÃ¦n. II. Enter Lord Jehochanan, and Lord Skimeon. Skim. Is the News certain that Agrippa's fled? Iehoc. Most certain, and to CÃ¦sar for relief. Skim. Tush! let the venom burst, I dare the worst of fates extremity, Death entertain'd with fear more terrifies The frighted soul, then doth the fatal blow: Let Pidgeon-liver'd slaves be tormented thus; I'le meet it smiling, with as bold aspect As e're I met the braving enemy. Iehoc. How full of hidden Ambiguities Grow these distracted times! The factious Commons giddy censure stand So strange and doubtful, that 'twere policy indeed To sound 'um to the bottom. Skim. To be a crouching, crawling, fawning Cur, To lick the lazy hands of prating Priests, With protestations of integrity Devoted whole to them: With true compuction of unfeigned grief Submissively to crave their gracious pardon: To paw the ragged multitude with praise Of their ingenuous care and fervent love For preservation of the Common-wealth; To promise fair rewards to froward fools Perhaps, with durtie feet to mire with fawnings, And then be beaten with the shameful staffe Of foul Reproach: To do all this were to be born a fool, To live a slave, and dye a coward. Death! I will stand between the counterbuffs Of these devouring storms in spight of Hell; Nor Priest, nor Pesant shall inforce me stoop An inch to either: as I have liv'd, I'le fall, Or freed from both, or rent up root and all. Iehoc. Or banishment or death we must expect. Hast thou not seen the ragged multitude, Whose stupid brains are stuft with nothing else But their mechanick skill, whose highest strain Of Cunning is to get some musty meat To feed the hungry maw, or ragged clothes To cover nakednesse, proclaim us bloody tyrants? These are they Whose strange distractions guided by the voice Of two or three, proclaim a traytors death: Now save him strait, and now nor save, nor kill, Nor yet release him; such their frantick will. Skim. The doting Priests believe 'um too: Death and the Devil! woo'd it not vex one's very soul To be arraign'd by these? In what a hodge podge of confusion Lives Iewry now? Must the rough sword of War Be guided by the rusty hand of Peace? To strike but when, &amp; where, and whom she please? Must we, whose noble actions have deserv'd Our place of Government, by countermand Of babling Priests be taught our lessons how, And when, and where, and what, and why to do? Have our unspotted fame traduc't by men Of vulgar note, by painted Butterflyes That buz the common rumours of the time And know not why? Death! I could burst with rage; Iehoc. And I with laughter, to behold the State And kingdom rul'd by a Mecanick pate. Enter Lord Eleazer mufled. Skim. See where's the prologue to the bloody ScÅne, Iehoc. Lord Eleazer mufled! Eleaz. Good morrow to you both. Skim. The like retor'd from both to Eleazer. My Lord, this outward guise of face and gesture May seem to speak some inward discontent. Elea. Nay more then seems my friends, for seems are show, But mine is substance: would it were not so. Iehoc. We will be sharers then my Eleazer. Eleaz. Nay must, Iehochanan, and deep ones too, So deep, I fear, your patience will not bear it. Skim. It must be deeper than destruction then. What e're it be unbosome it. Eleaz. You are betray'd: There's strict inquirie made to apprehend ye: The City Gates are barr'd, and strait commands On pain of death, that no man dare to stand In opposition. Skim. We did expect no less. Elea. Occasions of importance call me hence; Nor woo'd I be discovered in your company: What the event will be I know not yet; But fear your lives are aim'd at. A fitter time shall give a fairer scope To my discourse and counsel, So fare ye well. Exit Elea. Iehoc. Our love and thanks go with thee. Skim. How think'st thou now, Iehochanan? Have I not trac't the Blood-hounds at the heels? Stand'st thou amaz'd? why, didst not thou expect The fatal blow? Ieho. Skimeon, I did; nor do I fear to know What I have heard; the Message unto me Is but a tale twice told, whose second part Was told by him, the first by mine own heart. Vnto a soul whose unprepared mind Dreams not of danger when afflictions come; How terrible the yleok! the sudden chance O're whelms the frame of Nature with distraction. But to a man whose resolution stands Vnmov'd 'twixt floods of danger and despair, Whose sturdy stomack beats the Billows off With Arms of constancy, when every thought Proves traitor to the brest that gave it life; To him no mischief fate can strive to do, But boldly is embrac't, and scorn'd at too. And such am I. Skim. I do embrace thee, and with equal courage Stand arm'd for all events. [Enter Officers, &amp; apprehend them.] Officer. By the High Priests sacred power and strict command We apprehend ye both as traytors to the State of Iewry. Ieho. We do obey. Know'st thou where L: Ãleazer is? [They deliver their weapons.] Offic. We met him even now hard by the Synagogue. Skim. Befriend us with a Messehger that may Intreat him come and speak with us; we shall Reward you for your pains. Offic. It shall be done my Lord. Exeunt: Enter Eleazer. The City up in Arms, Agrippa fled, The Roman Legate slain, and Rulers banish't; Our sacred Father in the Royal throne, And we his Son next in succession; What can we wish for more? but soft, This day our Jewish Captains are arraign'd: Now Eleazer is the nick of time, That thy aspiring thoughts may bravely mount To Jewrie Scepter. How my distemper'd doubts disturb my brain, Puzzle my will, excrutiate my soul, Distract my judgementâ! O thou sacred thirst Of swelling honor! with what powerful aw Thou rul'st our erring actions! Be wary Eleazer, and foresee What chiefly may oppose or further thee. If these Commanders dye, where's then thy hope Of their united Power? No, that must not be, Their lives are precious, and preserv'd by mine assistance, Tyes them fast in strength and secresie. It shall be so. Enter Mess. By this time our Father's preparing to the Judgementâ: I must away to meet with him. Mess. My honor'd Lord, the Lord Iehochanan, with due respect unto your Lordship desires you come and speak with him. Elea. Tell him, we will be with him instantly. 'Tis as I could wish it, to be sent for too! If I can bring them off, I make them sure mine own. I will go visit them. Exit. Enter Mechanicks. 1. The zay the Captains shall be rain'd to day. 2. J neighbor Oliver! but how do they rain um? can ye tell? 1. Marry Neighbor I will tell ye; and for your better destruction, and more plain and pernicieus understanding in the matter, I will deride my speech into fixten several Sects. 2. Mercy upon us! hold Neighbor, hold; by no means, I pray; the derision will be too long of all conscience, and I shall never remember what contains to the Discourse: Let it be but two-fold Neighbor, and I shall reprehend it much better. 1. Very good Neighbor Timothy, it shall; and I will so handle the matter, that the whole Discourse shall be derided between you and I. 2. I marry, that will do passing well. 1. Hum-'um, mark neighbor, and medigate upon the matter. 2. I warraEt yee Neighbor. 1. Why look ye Sir, You are the Benefastor, and I am the Iudge: Now Sir your Benefactor is invited to appear before your Iudge, And to answer to such objections as he shall be justly excused for. Now sir am I to hear and excuse you of the crime, And to examine and commend your defence; And you to accuse your self of all that it alledged against you. 2. Peace Bully, peace; here comes the Iudges. 1. Mas! here they come indeed! by and by come your Benefactors I warrant yee. Enter the High Priest, and Eleazer his Son talking in secret with him: Gorian Priest, and Joseph his Son, with Attendants: the High Priest ascends the Chair, the other three sit below. H. Priest. Bring forth the Prisoners. A Bar set, and the Prisoners brought in. Iechochanan and Skimeon, we do accuse ye both of treason against the state of Iewry. Besides, we have been true inform'd, and that not by the mouth of one, but many, that those imperious dignities which we out of our pious love conferr'd upon you, you have most foul abu'sd, by which our sacred Laws are violate, and we (though innocent) yet stand deprav'd. Iehoc. It was, and is the custom 'mongst the Iews, That the Delinquent, how e're guilty, yet He fairly should enjoy the priviledge Of his Accusers opposition. Nor do I doubt that your obsequious care And zealous charity can derogate So much from nobleness, as to deny Vs fair proceedings. H. P. What by our sacred power we can, we will. Skim. First then, we shall desire to be inform'd Who our Accusers are, and what the ground Of our impeachment. Next we request the freedom of our speech, That we may fairly quit our selves so far as truth And our unspotted innocency require. H. P. We grant thee both. Read their Accusations. [Reads.] 1. First, you are indicted for a rebellious Muteny against the State of Jewry. 2. Next, of a most inhumane murder executed upon the Roman Legates. 3. Thirdly, of High treason against Agrippa your lawful Soveraign. L. Ieho. Wee'l answer brief to all. That we have slain the Roman Lords, 'tis true; But with what fervent love &amp; zeal unto your selves, And to the State of Jewry, may appeare, Most sacred Priest, by our submissions: For had our loves prov'd traytor to the State. Or to thy sacred self in this attempt, We had by our command sufficient power To have oppos'd both thee and that: But our intents were fair. 'Tis not unknown with what a heavy weight Of sad oppression wretched Jewry stood, Basely subjected, till by us made free. And call you this Rebellion? But when I call to mind that mungril Prince, That sacriligious thief; that any thing, Saving the sacred Name of Soveraign: That Bastard-Issue, sprung from Herod's Race, Of low discent in bloud, obscure and base; Not once regarded till by CÃ¦sar's Power A snatch't the Royal Scepterâ H. P. No more of that. We gave thee no Commission to revile Nor hadst thou power to kill, nor yet to save Those Roman Legates: What by thee was done Without our leave was flat Rebellion. Nor is this all we do object against ye. Read the Petition. [One reads.] An humble Petition from the grieved Commons for the execution of justice upon the two seditious Captains, Jehochanan and Skimeon. Skim. The common bawling Curs? O heaven! must we be weigh'd with them? with their simplicity? Death! I disclaim from their Mechanick spleen, and this ignoble tryal. H. P. Read out the grievances in the Petitionâ Skim. Sir, I will hear no further. H. P. Boiles your hot bloud so high with our preferment? Wee'l quench the fire, and then the heat will swage. We here dismisse thee of thy place of Government: Now Sir ye are a private man, and we Have sacred Power, and sole Authority To save or kill. And, for we will not dive Too deep into your warlike cruelty, Nor lean too much to private lenity; For thy rebellion and thy bold affront We doom thee banishment: We give thee three dayes liberty for thy departure: And do command hers here on pain of death Not to approach within our sacred walls, nor yet Iudea's confines Skim. I must, I do obey. Exit. H. P. And for you Iehochanan, upon submission of your self to us, we do release thee: But we charge thee, as thou lovest thy life and liberty, thou give us not henceforward any cause of just proceedings: So we dismisse thee. Iehoc. My humble thanks unto your sacred Power: Nor do I crave more favour at your hands then I shall strive henceforward to deserve. [Exit and exeunt Officers and Attendants.] H. P. Now we are private. O Ierusalem! Is thy decrepid Age already come! Or art thou hastned by untimely means To end thy dayes of honor? Is't not strange, that we Have sacred power to touch their cruelty, Yet dare not strike! Iehochanan we know as deep in blood as Skimeon, Both equal guilty; yet should both be banish't Their equal strength, united with their will, May much endanger us; mean while we stand As friends with one that we may both command. Weep Gorian, weep, or else our hearts will break, Our eyes will tell more then our tongues can speak. But I have done, the times are so extreme VVe have not leisure to lament our state; Our sudden danger summons us to sit In counsel strait to take some speedy course About our safety. Go. Heaven give a blessing to our fair proceedings. [A table brought, and they fit.] H. P. How truly doth experience teach us now, That fear once grounded in a Commonwealth, Proves oftentimes hereditary. The common rumor of Vespatians Host Strikes terror to the people. O the power Of this distracted fear! Even death it self Appears not half so terrible: But we trifle time. We are inform'd by sure intelligence, That he intends within these three dayes space Set footing in Iudea: How appointed Yet we know not; but to be suppos'd In all points like unto Vespatian. O Gorion, how methinks that Name Begets abortive twins of horrid grief Within this brest of mine! Those streams of blood Which by that fatal hand were lately spilt, Bleeds fresh within my soul. Gor. So would they do in mine if not repeld: To grieve our selves with what's impossible To be represt, is to desire to be More wretched then we are. Io. 'Tis true; it such is Nature that it strives to know It self in wretchedness, how truly we Acquire the center of our misery. H. P. Wel, No more of this; now to our present business, That you are zealous for your countries good I rest assur'd: Nor do I doubt your care And actual courage in a fair defence: Such I have ever deem'd ye. Nor do I fear but I shall find ye now The same. Now your attentions, then your fair assents To what I have to utter. To broach a war, and not to be assur'd Of certain means to make a fair defence, How e're the ground be just, may justly seem A wilful madness: Such is Iewries case. Are not our Towers defac't! our Walls unbuilt? Our Forces weakned, and our treasure spent? Our countrey ruinate, our people too Imbroile in native blood? O Gorion see, Iudea wars with Rome, Rome with the world, The world is conquer'd, and yet Iewry stands In opposition: Is not this to be Our own tormenters in self-cruelty? Go. We know the weakness of our State to be Vnable to resist, yet know not how To yeeld, or not to yeeld, or what to do: The furious tempest drives us on the Rocks Of Forreign and Domestick Enemies: The raving multitude will not endure To pay the Roman-tribute. Elea. VVhere common dangers meet with equal power, It stands not with our Honors to expose Our lives and fortunes to a base repulse. H. P. VVe will proclaim it death to him that dares Deny the tribute Money. Iosep. That were to blow the fire that burns so hot already. Such is our fate that we are forc't to sight VVith Rome, or with our selves. H. P. Since so it is, we will not sheath our sword In our own bosom; we will rather dye By Roman sword, then native butchery. Elea. Bravely resolv'd; nor do I doubt to see Iudea's ruines, loss and poverty Made good again with loss of Roman blood. Enter a Messenger. Mess. Peace to this sacred Meeting, but to Iudea bloody wars: Vespatian with ten thousand horse, and forty thousand foot is now arriv'd. H. P. Hast thee immediate to Iehocanan, bid him proclaim Vespacian coming, command him in our Name to muster up his forces, and to attend your further pleasure. Mess. I shall my Lord. H. P. Is't possible, already come! we must be speedy then in our designs. Iosep. 'Twere best with speed to send Embassadors To crave a truce for some small time whilest we Prepare our selves in fair hostility. Elea. Shame blast thy tongue, shall Iewry seek To Heathen Nation? Let their venom burst Into the worst of malice, we will stand In terms of equal Honor. Go. Thy judgement Eleazer is too rash, Thy youthful blood boils fury in thy brests And captivates thy reason unto passion. Elea. Gorian I tell theeâ Iosep. Ioseph tells thee first, That if thou blast my Fathers tongue with shame As thou hast blasted mine, may Ioseph lose his Name Of sacred Priesthood; butâ H. P. I do command you cease, the blood of strife Begins already to seize our sacred streets: I therefore will assign to each by Lot His several command, nor will my self stand free, But bear a part in this hostility. VVe will, even in the period of our age Grow strong again, inflam'd with holy rage Of our dishonor. VVithin there, bring forth the Lots. Elea. To me the country of the Edomites. One brings. Lots, they draw and open them. Iosep. To me Galilee. H. P. To us Ierusalem. Go. To all success from Heaven, may each man be Inspir'd with holy Zeal and Chivalry. Exeunt omnes. Finis Actus Primus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. II. Incipit Actus Secundus, ScÃ¦na Secunda. Sound Droms, and enter Vespatian and Titus his Son: Valerio and Nicanor, two Captains, with others. Vesp. Valerio. Val. My gracious Lord. Vesp. Since now we are thus happily arriv'd VVithin Iudea's Confines, March thou To Galilee, say we offer peace To Iewries Priests from Romes great Emperor; But on thy life take heed thou speak us not In too rough Language: Let thy milder phrase Sute thy Embassage with a pleasing stile, Adorn'd with powerful Eloquence; Yet with such graceful brave aspect, that thou Eclips not Roman Honor, The Iews are stout and lofty, therefore Art Shall give the first Alarum: If they refuse, Let then our Roman Eagle be displaid VVith all her sable Feathers, soaring high O're sad Iudea's desolation. Val. My Lord I shall obey. Exit. Vesp. Is the Ammunition safely landed? Titus. My Lord it is, and brought from Antioch, within a dayes journey of Gamala. Vesp. See it be safely stow'd, and let our Iron Rams be strongly fitted for the battery. Ni. It shall be done. Vesp. I'le make this sturdy Nation's greatness stoop To Romes command, or spend my aged blood In the Attempt. See there be store of strong Scaladoes too; VVe'el force their breaches in despight of death, And raze their sacred buildings to the ground. Lead on to Galilee. Exeunt. Enter Zareck. Zare. To be a piece of walking clay, a thing VVhose highest happines hath ever been To keep it self alive, and that life too Not for it selfe preserv'd, but others; is To be worse then a Beast; for they (However miserable in effect) Yet live contented, void of Reasons eye; They cannot see nor feel their misery. To be a man whose wretched life is fraught As full of fears as minutes, whose calamities the world laments, and yet not know his plague, Is to be happy: Why should Nature give More priviledge to beast then man? Lives there a Deity whose powerful hand Moves the great Module of this Vniverse; And can this be? Soft, Who comes hereâIehochananâ I will withdraw my self. Enter Jehochanan. The Letter shall be writ immediately; I but the means, the trusty means to send it: For to begin a work of such importance, And in the midst, even when the brave design Grows ripe with action, to be jaded then Woo'd prove a piece of policy to be Laught at by School-boyes. VVhat a secret maze Of hidden danger may the working brain Securely trade in, if not guided by The wary judgement! Certainly there is More crafty wiles and ambiguities VVithin this secret trade of villany. Then in the world beside: something must be done With speed and safety. Zareck blows the Winde in that Door. If I reveal the secret to a man Whose frighted soul shrikes from the undertaking, I loose my self for ever; and to be Assur'd in this, is impossible. Since then the weighty project must depend Vpon uncertainty, advise Iehochanan Vpon some secret way, whose circumstances Bar apparent dangerâStay, that must not be, To break it to a near Ally, Were to invite his zealous charity To countermand the Plot. NoâI must find a man Whose pining carcase wearied out with wo, Gapes after Gold; thereâthere must be the pill To work it. Zare. If my genius fail me not, I am the man: I'le shew my self. [a part. Iehoc. Well, I'le about itâha! There stands a fellow whose deject Estate Proclaims him truly wretched; cruel Fate Looks frowningly upon him: what a troop Of sorrows muster in his face, and yet He looks methinks as if a did despise His present Fortune: I'le try what's in him. Come hither fellow, why didst thou gaze even now With such a serious eye on those despised rags? Za. Yet these (how e're despis'd) will not afford A ragged answer to resolve your doubt; This ruin'd outside may for ought you know Have a fair inside: Did your Lordship think That that was tatter'd too: Why what have you to do to question me? Should I have ask't your Lordship what even now Your brains were busied on, you would have call'd Me sawcy fellow for my pains, I'me sure. And yet behold, Nature hath been to me As freely loving in distributing Her sundry gifts, as she hath been to you; My Limbs right shap't, my faculties endu'd With as much vigor as the best of yours; My thoughts as free; nor is my will confin'd With streighter limits then anothers is: VVheres then the difference? Is't because I wear These ragged Robes? why these do clothe me too; Yours do no more, nay not so much perhaps; For these (however poor) yet keep me warm [apart. Iehoc. I have not seen such boldness in such distress. [apart. I'le yet try him further. Why thou despised wretch, thou pittiful Patch't piece of misery, made for nothing else But to be pointed at; thou nasty thing, Whose noisom savour poisons those that meet it: How dar'st thou be so impudent? Za. But that I do desire to vex thee more, I would not answer thee: I dare! did I but know the way to doo't, vex thee to death; And (for I know 'twill ease thee now to rail) I'le leave thee to thy self. About to go out. Iehoc. I prethee stay, by this light I do love thee beyond expression. Za. How should I know that? Iehoc. Do but come back, and I will give thee proof of my affection: Thy Name? Comes back. Za. ZARECK. Iehoc. Take that, and if thou dar'st but do what I command Thou shalt not want preferment. Gives him Gold. Za. 'Tis Gold! If I dare do! if perform not what's in man to do, Let me be curs't into more misery then I have endur'd. Jehoc. Canst thou be secret too? Za. I can be any thing. Jehoc. Hark then, and take a weighty secret from me, Thou know'st L. Skimeon? Za. Very well. Jehoc. Hast heard the time, the manner in each circumstance Of his late banishment? Za. I have. Jehoc. And yet thou seest that I have freedom. Now mark: The fawning Prelates under fair pretence Of love and liberty, intend my ruine; My life is aim'd at Zareck. Which (for they dare not publikely attempt, Fearing the Commons which on my side stand) They'le act in private; bur Jehochanan Will live in spight of all their policy. Thou know'st the City Gates are slightly kept, This third succeeding night I have designd Lord Skimeons entrance with ten thousand men: This briefly shall acquaint him with the plot VVrites. Which thou shalt carry; but as thou lov'st thy life, Be secret Zareck. Za. Silence it self shall not be more my Lord. Iehoc. This done, return again with expedition. And thenâI, there's the master-piece indeed, The Gates, the City-Gates must be surpriz'd. Za. Let me alone for that. Jehoc. The watchmen must be murder'd Zareck and I fear Leaft in revealing of the plot to many We be discover'd. Za. Not for a world. Jehoc. How then? Za. I'le doo't my self. Jehoc. Thy self! thou canst not. Za. Tush fear not my Lord: The drowsie watchmen in the dead of night (void of suspition) will be taken napping. Jehoc. Dar'st thou attempt it then alone? Za. Rest you secure, if I perform it not I lose my self, you stand still undiscovered. Jehoc. Well, I will build upon thy trusty resolution. Enter a Messenger. Jehoc. To whom thy Message? Mess. Vnto you my Lord. The sacred Priesthood greets you well, and doth command you muster up your Forces ready to attend their further pleasure. Iehoc. It shall be done. Exit Mess. Vespatian is at hand, and we have power To raise our Forces; what a blessed hour This Message came in! Skimeon let in, Our Forces joind; the Citizens will turn to us for fear: Now Zareck play thy parts, And I will hug thee for thy precious Art. Exeunt. Enter Josephus and Captains. Josep. What think ye Soldiers, is not Jewry mad to wage a war with such a potent Prince Whose territories do extend as far As Britain, and the Kingdom of the Gauls. 1 Cap. I fear the factious Commons are seduc't And gatherhead against the sacred priests. Josep. Tis to be fear'd indeed: I wonder much The Messenger returns not from Jerusalem: The News is certain that Vespatian means To give the first assault to us in Galilee; We must be therefore sudden in our actions: I muse what good effect our Letters take. 2 Ca. See here my Lord, the Messenger. Josep. Of peace I hope, so it may stand with honor, Enter a Mess. thou com'st in happy time, we shall reward thy pains and care. Mess. My Lord, about to deliver your Letters to the sacred Priesthood, I was prevented by Jehochanan, and dispatcht away with this unto your Lordship. Delivers the Letter, and exit. Josep. Our Letter's intercepted all's not wel I fear. Opens the Let. &amp; reads Josephus, we have received thy Letters, and know not whether we may question thy wisdom or thy valour; we will at this time censure neither, but leave them to a further tryal of thy actions: But on thy life take heed thou treat not with Vespatian for a peace. So fare thou well, or ill, which thou deservest: Jehochanan. Call'd Coward to my face! Oh heaven Bear witness now with what disdainful scorn I entertain that title! Jehochanan thou lyest, and wou'd to Heaven I were Within the distance of this trusty Blade to make it good: Death! have I outliv'd my reputation? 1 Cap. Nay good my Lord. Josep. Indeed I trifle time, we have no leisure to be passionate. You see in what a maze of misery the State of Jewry stands; if therefore we Wil prise our Honours, or our Countreys good, we must with resolution bid defiance to Vespatian. If we embrace a peace, we raise a war Amongst our selves, and so we make a breach For Rome to enter: Hark! hark! Vespatian is at hand: [Drums beat afar off. Courage brave Soldiers, let not Romes command Abate your valours; make speed to muster up your Forces; to morrow early e're the break of day, I mean to give them battel. Exeunt. Enter an Herauld, and VALERIO with a white Flag; the Herauld summons the town to a parley, is answered; and enter IOSEPH and Captains upon the wall. Valerio. To thee the chief Commander of this place, And to the rest, my Master bid me say He sends this Flag of Peace, and wills thee pay the wonted tribute to the Roman-State: this done, A doth command thy late subjection. Josep. Bold Roman tell thy Master we defie His proud Command; nor will Judea pay The wonted tribute: Bid Vespatian come Himself, and do his Message. Val. Rebels take heed, if great Vspatian come, He comes in blood. Jo. Proud Roman, tel thy Master, Ioseph scorne to parley with a meaner then himself; tell proud Vespatian, that Iudea stands In equal terms of honour with his Lord. Val. Jew, thou't repent this arrogancy. Io. Roman, I tell thee, ere this Holy Land Shall yeild obedience to the Roman yoke, Ioseph will make the Roman Eagle totter. Val. Rebel farewel, when next we meet, I'le try How well thou canst maintain this bravery. Exeunt omnes. Enter Vespatian, Titus and Captains, with Drums and Colours. Vesp. How far are we now from Jorpata? Tit. Within the distance of a League my Lord. Vesp. What think ye Souldiers, shall we be receiv'd in peace? Nica. My Lord I doubt it. Ves. Well, how ere it be, we are prepar'd. Tit. I give to thee the sole Command Of the right wing; to thee the left, Nicanor. My self will stand betwixt ye both, that I may see your equal Valour strive For equal Honor in the Victory. Tit. My LordâValerio! Vesp. Welcome Valerio, com'st thou in peace? Val. My Lord prepare to fight, the sturdy Citizens intend this night to bid you battel. Vesp. What! are they stil so stout? By Heaven I'le scourge their pride. Val. My Lord, I saw them troop upon the hill, Not two mile distant: Hark! their Drums do beat, they march. Droms beat a far off. Vesp. Courage my Roman Souldiers, let me see this day your brave attempts for Rome and me. They come: Valerio, make good the Vanguard. Val. I shall my Lord. Enter Joseph and Captains, with Drums and Colours. Jo. What mean'st thou Roman, to disturb our peace? Vesp. Rebel, I do command thee kneel in Cesar's name. Io. Command thy slaves, for Ioseph scorns to bend Were Cesar here himself. Titus. How's that? Jo. Titus I tell thee, Joseph is a Prince, Deputed for the State of Galilee, Royal in Blood; and Cesar is no more, Nor thou so much. Vesp. Com'st thou to brave it out bold Jew, with words? Wee'l shew thee deeds to prove our Honors by, Draws And when thou seest our pedegrees made good Write thou thine own descent in Roman blood. Drums beat, and exeunt. They fight within, and enter Titus and Joseph at several doors, they fight: Joseph retires: And enter Vespatian wounded in the Leg with an Arrow. Titus. How fares my Father: Vesp. Lead me aside Titus, I am hurt. Exeunt. Leads him out. Enter Valerio and Nicanor. Val. The fight was bravely man'd on either part: Pray Heaven the General be well. Nica. I saw his silver tresses circled round With troops of Souldiers, till his valiant Son Bravely reliev'd him. Val. The Jewish Captain bravely stood it out, Even when his ranks had left him: Didst thou not see him when he was begirt With troops of Romans, with what brave advantage A still maintain'd the fight? and then, even then When death stood gazing on him, and his men Adjudg'd him lost, through what a bleeding Lane A bravely made his way, and so escap't? Ni. This way a took; come let's pursue the chase. Exeunt. Enter Joseph wounded, leaning upon his Sword. Io. This way, or that? is't so? then I have caught my selfe, and must take neither. SoâI must obeyâ Lies down. Lye there thou wretched carcass, and prepare thy self for dissolution. O Heavens! see the strange desires of base Mortality. Canst thou desire to live, thou wretched Earth, And see thy Honour dye? O misery Beyond expression. Enter Josephs two Captains. 1 Cap. This way our Leader took. 2 Cap. See where he lyes. 1 Cap. How fares my Lord? Ioseph. Even as the Lyon fares, When strong entangled in the Hunters toil, A chafes his Royal heart with rage, to see Himself intrapt. Cry within, follow, follow, follow. 1 Cap. My Lord, we are persu'd even at the heels, Shift for your life. Ios. Away and save your selves, my wounds will not give leave. 1 Cap. Come, we will bear you hence. Ios. Your hands, stay: Within this Vale there is a secret Cave, Whose private entrance now o'regrown with moss, Will hardly be discern'd: Lead me to that. 1 Cap. Happily thought of. They enter the cave. Enter Titus, Valerio, Nicanor. Titus. 'Tis beyond my understanding which way their General hath scap't us. Val. And mine too, my Lord; but sure I am a cannot be far hence: Nor can a long continue where a is: Vnless Camelion like a feeds on air. Ti. Well, hee's a noble fellow; if thou find'd him Valerio, use him with equal honor to his worth. Val. My Lord I shall. Ti. Tell him on the faith of great Vespatians Son, A shall be gently us'd. So fare thee well, I wish thee good success. Val. My Lord I shall obey. Exit Titus. What course shall we take now, Nicanor? Ni. Troth we may wink and chuse; our first and second course is all but Sallets: Physick, Physick Valerio, most inexpressible Physick; why I have walkt my self into such an abstract of abstinence that I can relish ye the distinct nourishment of the thicker, thinner, and more refined air, and shall in time, no doubt, attain to the perfection of the Camelions diet. Val. Prethee be serious now, And lets pursue the search. Ni. Content; but by this hand I swear I will endur't no longer then this night. Exeunt. Enter the two Captains out of the Cave. 1 Cap. Death, I am almost starv'd, My hungry maw devours my vital blood. What is to be done? 2 Cap. To make escape's impossible; We are begirt with Romans round about. 1 Cap. Death, shall we dye like Dogs? 2 Cap. No, in despight of hunger, we will dye like men. Draws, takes the weapon. Here, take this weapon, and despatch me first. 1 Cap. Stay, swear to be constant in the brave performance. 2 Cap. I do, do thou the like. Kisses the Sword. 1 Cap. I vow the same: we are agreed. And now in honour to our brave farewel, Wee'l kill our Captain first. 2 Cap. Content, let's call him out. 1 Cap. What, ho, Ioseph, come forth, prepare thy self to dye. (Ioseph comes out with his weapon drawn. Jo. Are we discovered? 2 Cap. Yes, hunger has spy'd us in her grannams den, And sent her Sister Famine to devour us Jos. What means this mad Discourse? 1 Cap. Know brave Commander, we have cal'd thee out To lead thy Souldiers in the march of death. As thou hast liv'd, so thou shalt bravely dye, thou art the Prologue to our tragedy. We mean to kill thee; therefore prepare thy self. Ios. Villains ye dare nor. 1 Cap. Dare notâ Offers a thrust at him. Ios. Holdâask counsel first of Heaven, &amp; tel me then Which of your bold rebellious tongues dare speak So fowl a word: O ye wretched fools! Where is that better part of man become, whose nobler Nature hunger cannot touch, that can endure to feel the Carcase pine, Yet scorn to yeild, till by a power Divine It's summon'd to obey? Lo, where's your valour now? Lives it within this wretched lump of earth? Or is it seated in the sacred soul? O Heavens! have we power to make the most despised creature breathing here? And shall our daring hands presume to take Away the noblest? For shame rememberâ 1 Cap. No more, by heaven we will endure no longer: Thinkst thou with words to alter our intent? Come, prepare thy self, for we have sworn. Ioseph. HoldâI do consent: But let me crave a little time of truce To make my peace with Heaven 2 Cap. We grant it thee. Jo. prays apart. Io. I am resolv'd to dye: But ere I do receive the fatal blow, I do command ye by the sacred tye Of solemn Oaths, to grant me one request. 1 Cap. Except thy life and ours, we yeild to any thing. Io. I do embrace your offer. Here, swear on your Honours to perform what I command. Cap. We swear to do it. They swear upon his Sword. Io. Since then our dying minutes do depend upon each others fatal Execution, to free each person from the bloody guilt Of wilful slaughter, I ordain by lots, Each man receive his death: the manner shall be this. Our number in the Cave is forty just, We will unite our selves by two and two, then cast by lots which couple shall dye first: the couple first to dye shall likewise cast Which of them two shall kill his fellow, then He that remaineth shall make choice of one Of the next lot to take his life away. This done, each may in order fairly dye Without the guilt of wilful butchery. 1 Cap. We like thy counsel well, make thou the lots, And let us to the Execution. they enter the cave. Enter Nicanor, and Valerio. Ni. This search is endless, which way now Valerio? Va. Faith even to bed I think. Ni. Into what secret angle of the earth Is this distressed Iew retired? Va. Hee's not above ground sure, or if a be, Hee's metamorphosed to some other shape. Groan in the Cave. Ni. Hark, what noise was that? Va. Your fancy sure, I heard no noise. Ni. Prethee be still and listen. Hark, Groan agen. I hear it now, let us go forward and enquire the cause. Ni. Which way came it? Va. That way: Ni. Let us go soft and listen. They go soft along, and Exeunt Enter Ioseph, and his fellow with weapons. Cap. Why dost thou lead me out? Io. To kill thee if thou make resistance, thou foolâ Canst thou beleeve that Ioseph means to dye Without his Makers leave? Curst be that hand that dares be lifted up Against the power that made it, Even by that sacred power, whose awful name I dare not utter, tis not I fear to dye, But to offend so great a Majesty: Cap. Tush I will not hear thee, prepare thy self to fight, I am resolvd to dye. Io. Be wise thou wretched man, and do not fool thy life away, remember who I am that hath preserv'd thee in the lot with me, Beware thou tempt me not too far, If thou resist me, by all thats good, I vow to kill thee, and preserve my self. Cap. Thou hast prevaild, do with me what thou wilt, Io. Retire we then into the Cave agen, lest we be discovered. They enter the Cave. Enter Valerio and Nicanor agen following. Ni. By this light Ile follow thee no further. Va. Prethee be patient lets but search this vale, And on a Romans word we will retire, Didst thou not hear it since? Ni. No, or if I did I woo'd not tell thee so, For fear we amble out another night: But sure I am we are not far remote From whence we heard it first: Va. There's surely some enchantment in this place, I will enquire the cause: What ere thou art that in this shady grove Do'st shroud thy self from sight, whose dismal voice Declares the story of some sad distress. Be thou infernal feind confined here, To dwell in darkness for a thousand year, Or be thou some sad soul enforc't to dwell Within this place, till thou return to hell, Or be thou Goblin, Fairy Elf or Hag, Or Witch in shape of wolf that lov'st to drag Poor infants to the den; what ere thou be If thou have power to speak, I charge thee answer me. Jo. If thou wilt tye thy self by solemn vow. Speaks in the Cave. Not to discover me. I will declare Both who, and where I am: Ni. Art thou there old boy? Val. Tye me to any thing but that, and I will grant it thee, And swear to doo't. Jo. Art thou a Roman? Va. I am. Io. Swear then to bring me safe unto Vespatian. Va. By all the gods I will: Io. Tell me thy name, Va. Valerio. Io. Make now a Covenant 'twixt thy self and me, That what thou hast protested may appear Vnder thine hand and seal. Write that thou wilt conduct both me and mine In safety to thy Lord Vespatian. Writes, and reaches it to him on the end of his Lance, and then Io. and the Capt. comes out. Va. To give thee satisfaction I will doo't: Where art thou now? Io. Here. Opens the Cave. Doo'st thou not know me Roman? Va. Art thou that brave Commander of the Iews, Whose Martial Prowess Rome doth so admire? Ios. Lo I am he brave Roman that have stood The furious shock of my distressed fate; Behold me now, and whilst thou lookst upon This lump of earth captivd to thee and Rome, Know then that Ioseph dares, but cannot dye, Our sacred Law forbids such cruelty. Va. By all the tyes of a true Roman word, Thou art nobly welcome. Ni. Welcome to us both. Io. To both my equal thanks. N. Where are the Souldiers that escaped with thee? Io. Dead all, save this, whom I desire you both To favour as my special friend, and one Whose valour may deserve your love: The circumstances of the others loss We will refer untill some fitter time. Va. Let it be so. Come my brave Souldier, great Vespatians son Will joy to see thee safe. Exeunt. Sound Musick, and enter a Dumb Shew. Vespatian and Titus two Souldiers follow bearing a Crown, Vespa. conferreth with Titus, then enter Valerio and Nicanor with Ioseph and the Cap. they present Ioseph to Vespa. Ioseph kneels, a Vespatian and Titus imbrace him, Valerio and Nicanor whisper with the Souldiers, take the Crown of them, and present it kneeling to Vespatian, he refuseth twice, they draw and force him to ascend and take it; Titus kneeleth, Vespatian imbraceth him: Ioseph takes leave of Titus and the rest, and exit with Vespatian, and the Captains consult, and exeunt at the other doors. Chorus. Romes great Commander, Nero, lately dead, Behold, now good Vespatians aged head Enjoyes the Diadem, conceive him now Ariv'd at Rome there with a solemn vow Of bloody war, he raiseth fresh supply to aid his valiant son in Galile: Ioseph is sent to Rome by Cesars son, there lives a captive till the wars begun Against Ierusalem, mean time we pray Let pleasing musick charm the time away.

      <field name="fulltext">Incipit Actus tertius Scena secunda. Enter Zareck, with Ieho. Letter. The time steals on a pace, I must be brief in my delivery. Knocks within. Who knocks? Za. A servant to the Lord Iehochanan, Serv. Your business? Za. Tis private to your Lord, Serv. I will inform him so: Enter Skimeon. Skim. From whom thy business? Za. Read this my Lord, and you shall be resolv'd. Skim. My Lord, multiplicity of words protract time, the third night from the date of this you shall have entrance into the City, be sudden, strong, a bold farewel. Reads the Letter. I shall not fail, commend me to thy Lord, and bid him rest assured of my appearance. Exit. Za. I will my Lord. Skim. Farewel, be sudden, strong, and bold; Za. I will be all. But 'tis Iehochanan to work thy fall. Exit. Enter Eleazer. Elea. To be, or not to be, I there's the doubt, For to be Sovereign by unlawful means, Is but to be a slave to base desire, And where's my honour then? What a strange buzzing of ambition Pursues my thirsty soul? O Eleazer! can thy traytor breast Give harbour to a thought of Paricide? It is thy father, O the sacred tye Of filial duty, how that awful name Affrighteth all my faculties with fearâ With fear?âof what?âwith foolery by heaven; If there be ought within this awful name That can extort obedience from a son. 'Tis but the rotten Carcass, there's the thing That for to please its self begets another, So does a beast, and yet 'twixt them we see An equal freedome of society: As for the nobler part of man we know That's of a higher birth, if it be so, Thus low my knee shall bend, but thou my heart Bends his knee. Scorn to obey, remember where thou art: I am resolv'd, the times are bloody, and the peoples hearts I hear, are bent on me: Iehochanans the man that I must fairly close with all, this done, We shall be strong for opposition. Soft, here a comes. Enter Jehochanan. Iehoc. My Lord Eleazer. Elea. Iehochanan, well met. Ie. My Lord, if without a breach of manners, I might be bold to question with your Lordship; I should desire to know the secret cause of your accustomed sadness, which good my Lord (pardon my boldness) as tender of your Lordships health and honour, I have of late observed. Elea. O my Iehochanan, I know thou lovest me well embraces him. Nor will I in words or actions give the cause To say I am unthankful, though I must confess The greatest part of my requital, is Too mean for thy deserts, the means Iehochanan, I want the means to counterpoise thy worth. Io. O my gracious Lord, your love hath ever been A full requital to my poor deserts: But, good my Lord, the cause of this your sadness? Elea. O I have been tormented to the soul, To see the strange distraction of the times, To see the sacred City rul'd by those Whose poor decrepid brains are fitter far For drowsing pillows, than for bloody war. Ie. My Lord your fatherâ Elea. O that cheating name, With what a magick spell it doth bewitch The crazy judgement, and besot the soul With adoration of this lump of earth? Ie. You know my Lord there is a sacred tye Enjoyns obedience. Elea. Tush, meer policy, A trick, a cheat, to keep the world in aw: Death, I am vext to think how men are gull'd. Ie. My Lord, I understand not what you mean, Elea. Thou canst not be so dull: Is't so? I dare not utter now, what I conceive, O my good Lord remember that your fatherâ Apart. Elea. No more, by all that's good I hate the name of father. Ie. Death, I am discover'd Ie. Now I have found ye Sir, and must have leave To tell your Lordship that you do me wrong, From which of all my actions have ye pickt Even but a shew of treason to the state? Elea. How? ye forget your self. Ie. Tis you my Lord that both forget your self and me. Elea. Agen? Ie. Nay I must tell ye, 'twas not for your honour, Vpon the buzzing of some bare report, To undermine your friend. Elea. Speakst thou this in earnest? Ie. I do, and will in earnest, stand Against that traytor whose presumptuous hand Dare touch your aged father. Elea. Vngrateful slave, the traytor I return With interest of what thou dost deserve, Traytor to me, and traytor to the state. Ie. This, but to play another time upon me, Which ended, still Iehochanan's the same. Elea. Dar'st thou not stand for Eleazer then? Ie. I neither dare, nor will: Elea. Then I dare kill thee. They draw and fight. Ie. Hold, art thou in earnest? Elea. The to'ther bout will tell thee; Ie. Swear by the honour of a loyal friend, And I beleeve it. Elea. By heaven I swear, and by the sacred tye Of settled friendship, what my words express, My actions shall confirm. Ie. Then thus I do imbrace your love. Now my Lord, What ere the project be, I vow assistance and fidelity: Elea. Then take it thus, Thou hast command to muster up thy forces, Let it be done with expedition, My doting father hath devis'd this plot To cheat the Citizens, whose greedy souls thirst for Vespatians blood; but fearful, they while thus they gull the people, mean to pay the wonted tribute money, and with slavish fear to crave a peace of the proud Emperour. This on my life is true, but wee'l prevent it. Ie. I but the means my Lord? E. To morrow morning ere the break of day Muster thy forces to the market place, there I will meet thee with a warlike troop Of youthful Citizens, then wee'l command On pain of death that none presume to stand for peace, or for the payment of the tribute money; this done, what's he that dares deny it. Ie. My Lord, I do approve of the design, But fear a potent opposition, I therefore do advise, that we provide Some speedy aids to give assistance to Our enterprize. Elea. But how shall this be done? Ie. Leave that to me, mean while be sure to keep the time appointed: Elea. I will not fail, farewel Iehochanan. Exit Eleazer. Ie. A dew my Lord: Why let the Mungril Curs go play, And lordly Lions fight. The braver beast shall win the day, And so my Lord good night: But I forget my self: Tis now about the time the lazy watch With wary steps begin to walk the round: And this the night that Zareck must be here, I will withdraw my self, for what noise is that? Enter the Watch. 1 W. Come neighbor, come; 'tis we must stand too't when all's done. 2 W. I neighbour, wee'l stand to our tacklings I warrant ye. Je. The Watch, I've steal aside. 1. What was that that went by neighbour? 2. Where, where, neighbour, where? 1. Marry there, just there something stole along, 2. Was it not a spright, God bless us? 1. No, no, no, 'twas nothing but a diffusion. But as I was saying, neighbour; 'tis we must stand too't, because we be not book-learn'd, as they say, they count us but unlitter'd fellows, but let um say what they will, we are the very legs of the Commonwealth; for when we be drunk, the City reels fort I'me sure. 2. Mas neighbour, and ye say true. 1. I woo'l stand toot, that a Watchman hath more torrity than a Justice a Peace. 2. What wool ye neighbour, how prove ye that? 1. Marry thus I prove it: Yet watchman (taking him in his office of prefermity) may be drunk by torrity of his place, because he watches the City, and no body watches him, so cannot your Justice. Agen, your watchman may issue out, and reprehend any person for any fribolous offence, as murder, or the like, and for a feeling, as they call it, let him go without further excommunication, so cannot your Justice; for when the Benefactor is before him, he must nilli willi reign him according to the vigour of the Law. 2. How say by that. 1. Nay I heard my neighbour Timothy say, that if all your chief officers should dye in a night, your watchman should be a Justice a peace himself: nay I tell ye neighbours, the depth of our places is very high. 3. See, see. 1. W. Well, come let us take our stand here, we shall see some vacant fellow, rambling this way anon, I warrant you. 2. What must we do then neihbour? 1. Marry we must remit um to prison, and then ask 'um whither they were going. 3. But what if they run away neighbour? 1. Why then we must knock um down, and bid 'um stand. Nay I warrant ye neighbour, I have all ye'r points of law Barbatim. 1. This gate neighbour (you wood 'mire to hear it) This gateâfor I am sure I speak within my compass: This gateâLord how the time runs away, me thinks 'twas e'ne but yesterday. This very Gateâ Thunder. What was that, what was that neighbour? 2. 'Twas a clap of thunder. 1. Mas if this weather hold, we shall have a stormy night on't. Where did I end neighbour, can ye tell? 2. At [gate] neighbour Oliver: 1. Well. Well, this very gate was directed that very night that I was made a watchman, which did pronosticate (as I may say) the good service that I shoo'd do here. Thunders agen. 2. Trust me truly neighbour, if this weather hold, we shall have a soul night on't as you say. 1. 'Twas e'ne in such a night as this that my neighbour Timothy and I ran away from the Constable; for I tell ye neighbour, we are not to repose our selves to the danger of such seasonable weather. 2. Mas neighbour I'me e'ne of your minde for that, let's go get some shelter. 1. Content, content. Exeunt. Thunder, and enter Zareck with a Rapier, and a wrenching Iron. Za. Lye there a while till I have Layes down the Iron, and goes soft to the Gate. use for thee: A, as I could wish it, this stormy night hath driven the watch away Beyond my hopes; why it may now be done With ease and safety. Thunder. Speak lowder, lowder yet thou dreadful sky, Whose flaming face speaks terror to the world; The daring Lion now dares not approach The craggy mountain to devour his prey. the ravening Wolf lies lurking in his den, And howls to hear this strange combustion, the fatal bird of night, whose dismal voice Foretels some ill event, cryes now for fear: Nor man, nor beast dares budg, yet unto me thou art as pleasing as the rosie morn, Whose lovely cheeks look smiling on the day, How fit thou comest to give assistance too My brave exploit? for now no sooner shall the thunder speak, but I will thunder too upon the gates: now, now the sport begins: It thunders, and he wrenches the gate. the gates unbar'd, and Edomites let in, Ile post immediately to the Synagogue, And there relate with admiration the strange effect of the late fearful thunder, till I have maz'd the learned fools with wonder: thunder agen, he opens the gates. Agen, agen, agen, once more, and then 'tis done And bravely too, without suspicion. Enter L. Skimeon with others, with torches, Rapiers, and a Drum. Za. My Lord? Sk. Thou art a trusty fellow, I will reward thy pains, Where is thy Lord? Za. Follow me, I will conduct ye to him. About to go out. Enter Jehochanan, and others, with torches and Rapiers. Ie. Welcome, my dearest friend, come wee'l away, And take our stand within the market place, Strike up the Drum, the dreadful noise will fright the drowsie Prelats in the dead of night. Exeunt. Enter H. Priest and Gorion at several doors in haste, with Night-gowns and tapers. H. P. O Gorion we are lost, the Rebel Skimeon with his ragged band of theeves, and Cut-throats, this tempestuous night Hath gotten entrance, Jehochanan I fear will joyn his forces too, speak Gorion, speak, What's to be done? Go. Wee'l take the temple for our sanctuary, thither the Citizens will boldly come. H. P. We must be speedy then, O Gorion, we want time to weep for our calamity. Enter Mechanicks with Weapons. Cap. Come on my brave bilbow blades, my roaring Renegadoes, and my ragged Ruffians, which side shall we take now? 1. Marry my brave Captain of the ragged Regiment, we will take the strongest. Cap. Mark me my valiant Mirmidons. 2 Me. Mark him, mark him. C. I will instruct ye in the Rudiments of war; 1. M. A will instruct us rudely in the war; mark him, mark him. Cap. When I your brave Commander bid you stand, Be sure ye budg not, Hum, Hum, Stand: 1 M. Why so we do, don't we? C. March up in equal rank. 2 M. We are not such fools I trow; did not a bid us stand? 1 M. I marry did a, we wont budg an inch I warrant him. Cap. By the bright honour of mine Eminence My reputation will be quite defac't. I must indoctrinate their dull capacities With a more ample measure of my meaning: Advance your Bilbows thus: They advance. Now faces about. Look over their shoulders. C. Now Mars defend me, what a rabblement Of rude disorderd Rebels have I met with all? 1 M. O ho faces about; follow me, follow me. Cap. Well done my valiant Varlets, Now march each man with fury in his face, And I your valiant Don will lead you on unto the Market place. Enter Zareck. M. O ho, here comes one, knock him down, down with him. Ca. Hold I say, he comes perhaps to joyn in our Batalio, Whose side art thou on fellow? speak, why dost not speak? Ha. Za. Your patience, and Ile declare my business. 1 Me. Patience? we scorn patience, we must march in fury. 2 M. Down with him, down with him, do's a talk of patience? Cap. Silence, I say, ye shallow-brain'd simplicians, For we are pleas'd to hear his embassie. 1. Silence, silence, and listen to the emphasis: Apart. Za. Vnless I speak in some unheard of stile Tis sure impossible to get fairly off: Most indefatigable Commander, and cabalistical Captain of this most enormious equipage. Cap. The stile is most profound, and enigmatical, Za. From the three Captains of the Regiment I was commanded to accoast thy greatness: Cap. Hum, hum, declare the sum of thy concernancy. Za. I will be most concise, By the energetical power of this my embassie, I do command thee tell why thou art up in Arms. Cap. Thou hast concocted the crudities of my stomack into choller, and I am displeased at thy most profuse evaporation. Talk'st thou of commanding fellow, Hah? Za. Mistake me not, most mighty man at Arms. Cap. Avant thou vapour of indignity, Go tel thy Lord, I'le parly with himself. Za. I will return thy most elaborate encounter. Exit. Cap. Now by mine honour, I am mov'd with mighty indignation, and will approach in my fury: Come follow my boyes, follow. M. Follow, follow. Exeunt. Enter Ananias and Gorion with weapons, and Eleazar, Jeho. Skimeon, with weapons at several doors. Ananias. Goodness defend me, am I awake? or do I dream of horror? Starts back at the sight of his son. Look up ye wretched eyes, and gaze your fill, Glut all the greedy faculties of soul With this prodigious sight: Rebellious boy, I do command thee kneel: Elea. smiles. By all that's good a laughs, laughs me to scorn, And still persists, even to my face persists with mockery. Assist me heaven, and thou distressed earth, Extend thy forces to the highest strain Of mans invention; let this fatal hour Extort the noblest of thine aged powr: Ignoble, irreligious, Paricide, Monster of men, rebellious runnagate; By the Celestial powers severe commands, By filial duty, and the sacred tye Of Iewries Law, or if by none of these, By that eternal vengeance that shall Fall upon thy cursed head; I do command thee kneel: Guard me ye blessed ones, and look up E. laughs. the great affliction of a poor old man. Elea. I knew the froward humor must have vent: Now it has eas'd it self, and will not be so tutchy. Why thou impetuous fool, canst thou expect Obedience from a Son? Look, look but upon thy self, and see Of what decrepped age and misery thou art compos'd: Behold the reeling State Distracted, feeble, seek, and ruinate, turn'd topsie-turvy by thy doating brain. And canst thou dream of Soveraignty? An. O my distressed Fate! Ingrateful Cur, that hast been bred to prove An open shame to all posterity. Behold me wretch, and whilst thou look'st upon A Sons Rebellion, and a Fathers wrong; Curse the detested hour that did beguile Thy erring foul with this pernicious plot. Elea. Peace dotard, I will hear no more: the rotten tooth infects the wholsom gum, Is noisom, painful, loose and troublesom, Hinders the growth of that that must succeed, And must be drawn. Enter Mechanicks. Cap. Come follow, follow my boys, follow. Go. Welcome my worthy citizens, thrice welcom all. Cap. Gramarcy old bully. Go. Beholdâ Sk. If ye respect your lives and liberties, hear not the babler speak. Go. Behold dear countrey-men, behold a man, Points to the high-priest. Your Priest, your Prophet, and your Soveraign: Religious, wise, and zealous for the state, Even from his Infancy immaculate. Cap. Be brief, be brief old boy. Behold a Son; O heaven! why do I call Him son? behold a villain most unnatural, A cursed wretch, that dares devise a plot to cheat the State, and cut the Kingdoms throat. Cap. How's that? how's that? cheaters and cut-throats, cheaters and cut-throats, I like not that Barlady. Me. Look to your pockets boyes, look to your pockets, they be cheaters. Go. O can ye see those precious tears run down, And not be mov'd with pity? Ananias weeps. M. Pity! hang pity, we are Souldiers, we scorn pity. Ie. Dear friends, wise Citizens, and valiant countrey men] Salutes them. M. I, I, let us alone for Wisdom and Valour. Cap. Let the circle of thy circumference be mov'd to his proper place. 1 M. What dee mean? what dee mean? pray be cover'd. 2 M. Go not too near him Captain, for all this, the more curtsie, the more craft. An. Ingrateful slave, dar'st thou oppose thy self 'gainst him that gave thee life and liberty? Go. O hear him not dear friends, a will beguile Your honest understandings. C. Beguile a pudding, speak on Jocky, speak on. Ie. That you are zealous for your Countries good, I nothing doubt; nor do I fear your love And fair attentions. Mark then dear Countreymen, mark I beseech you, And with your deep discretions truly weigh the scope of our proceedings. Cap. Hum, hum, begin my man of mettle. Ie. In the black tempest of a shipwrackt State, When Prince and People stagger'd with the load Of sad Oppression; when the peoples groans, When Mothers tears, and Infants miseries Were at the full; where, where was then the man that durst oppose this strange confusion? Was it not I, my valiant Countrey-men? Behold Iehochanan dar'st boldly say, 'twas he that forc'd that bastard King from hence, that slew the Roman Lords, that did deny to yeild to Romes outragious cruelty: Tis not unknown unto the meanest here? M. What's that? does a make mean fellows of us? Ie. Mistake me not, I know ye worthy all, All men of judgement, wise and valiant all. Yet give me leave dear friends to let ye know there are degrees of worth. M. O ho, we mistoost him, we mistook him, we are mean in worth that's well, that's well; go on my brave Captain. Ie. 'Tis not unknown I say, what heavy yokes Observe the word dear friends, for 'tis emphatical. Cap. Very good, an emphatical yoke. Ie. What heavy yokes I say have been impos'd Vpon this injur'd Nation. What loads of sorrows have been laid upon Our weary loins, and yet (O heavens) to see With what strange patience and humility We have endur'd it. Are not your Kings depos'd, your freedoms lost, Your Laws transacted, and your goods despoil'd, Your Wives abus'd, your children massacred, Your Rulers banisht, and your selves become A scorn to all posterity? Will ye be asses still, and bear this heavy load? Will ye be slaves for ever? Can there be At least a thought of such stupidity? M. O Heaven M. How's that! how's that! a calls us slaves and asses: Down with him, Captain, down with him. Cap. Hold, hold I say, my ragged rusticks, For his Emphasis will bear it. M. His Emphasis bear it! his Emphasis's an ass, We scorn to bear it; down with him I say, down with him. Cap. Now by the might of my omnipotence, he that dares strike a blow, a shall feel the fury of mine indignation. Elea. And now dear Countrey-men behold the man, Your Priest, your Prophet, and your Soveraign. An. Dar'st thou to boast in thy impiety? Skim. If ye be free-men let me hear ye cry, Lord Eleazer, Life and Liberty. All M. A Free-man, a Free-man, a Freeman; down with old gray beard, down with gray beard. Go. Curse on that wicked hand that dares a blow against that sacred head; let it be seiz'd with death by a Divine revenge; Or let it ever be A withered member of impiety. But if the wicked fury must have vent, Vpon my knees I beg, let it be poured out Vpon this head of mine. O Eleazer, canst thou look upon the great afflictions of this good old man, And not be drownd in tears of penitence? Behold the torrent of his grief is such, A has not power to express his misery. A has no eyes to weep no tongue to speak, No sence to comfort, but a heart to break. Elea. Theres something in this old enchanters tongue that will beguile me; peace, I will hear no more. Go. Then mayst thou ne're be heard of heaven. Behold, the highest strain of misery, old Gorion begs even of his enemy. Elea. Peace impotent fool, I say, I will hear no more. Go. Then thou must stop thine ear, for I must speak: Elea. Come Souldiers, let's away, hear not the babler speak. M. No, no, no, wee'l hear no impudent old men. Cap. March on my man of mettle, we will follow thee through thick and thin, up to the chin In blood, my bonny buntings. Exeunt omnes, but high Priest and Gorion Go. Heaven give thee strength to bear this misery. An. In what a labyrinth of wretchedness Dwells this forsaken City! how the streets Swarm with the sons of death! the sons of death I O may that name of son for ever dye, And yet nought but the Name, the wretched Name: Long may the Substance live: the Substanceâwhy? What is the Substance? If the Name be foul, Farewel the rest for ever. And yer methinks it were too short a time to take so long a leave: Stay then, what is the Substance? the Substance is my son, Agen my son: Ile say it is my self, My very self divided from my self: And then methinks 'tis wondrous strange to see (And yet 'tis wondrous true, my self to be A butcher to my self: And thenâif it be so, Why do I blame a Sonâwas it not I that gave him shape, and life, his faculties Of will and reason? to do well or ill, are from above. Had a been born a beast, a had been free From such unheard-of, cursed crueltie. Go. How strongly Nature works, ere it can part With that it woo'de effect. An. O Eleazer, if thou wert not mine, I could be happy in my misery. Thou art a villain, yet thou art my son, My son, and yet a villain; there's a word Able to make a Fathers heart-string's crack, Go. No more good man. An. Strange actions I have heard have sometimes wrought strange alterations. Were it not strange to see the Sun go back, Or borrow light of the unconstant Moon! Were it not strange to see the Cedar bend, And do his homage to the lowly shrub! Or to behold the stately Lion crouch, And stand in fear of the dejected Lamb; If none of these may yet seem strange, behold A thing more strange; the head must serve the heel, The Villain Son must stand. the Father kneel. O Gorion! if one spark of love he left In that ingrateful breast; or if there be At least one dram of goodness yet remaining, this act will penetrate his erring soul, Startle his Conscience, and amaze the will, Affright the judgement, and divert the plot, the bloody plot: O! I am lost with grief, And do I know not whatâAnd yet it must be done: Come, go with me I say, for I will kneel. Go. Heaven send thee comfort in this extasie. Exeunt. Enter a Carter with his whip, at one door whistling, and the Lady Miriams man, Peter, at another. Peter. What, brother Penuel, what a murren mak'st thou here. Nay, nay, nay, I prethee leave thy whewing, and tell me apart. what thou mak'st hereâno I'le hold a groat I'le make ye leave anon; why sirrah, if thou didst but behold what a pittiful pernicious face thou mak'st with whistling, thou wouldst take up stones and throw at it. Pen. Take heed thou dost not whistle Peter. P. O, I thought I should put ye out a tune. Pet. Why prethee? Pen. I can hardly endure thy face without it. If thou shouldst whistle, thou wert utterly undone, I should never forbear throwing at it. Pet. Well contorted efaith boy. Ped. Nay I can tell ye Peter, for wit and understanding I am not regenerate, as they say, for my Father had as much knowledge as any man of his understanding in the town I woos. Pet. Well, well, well, I have nothing to do with knowledge and understanding Pen. Then thou'rt a fool Peter. Pet. I am won of your making then, and indeed it may well be for they say won fool makes many: I think I was even w'ye there for the fool. Pen. Excellent good efaith Peter. Pet. Nay I can tell ye, I had a Father too; well, well, I know what I know; but all's one for thatâum, um: But I prethee boy tell me, tell me what mak'st thou here? Pen. whistles. By this hand if thou wilt not leave whistling, Ile throw stones. Pen. Why canst not thou tell what I make here? Pet. Not I as I am a Gentleman. Pen. Why thou hearst I make musick bully. Pet. Musick with a pox, prethee leave making Musick, and make me an answer. Pen. Marry then I will tell thee what I make here: I am come to follow the wars my boy: They say the new Captains entertain all comers, And I am all on fire to be at it. Oâmethinks I could so pepper thee now. Pet. Ohâohâprethee hold, or else I shall need to be salted too: But efaith boy, art in earnest? if thou beest, shake hands, shake hands. Pen. Why thou art not run away from thy Lady too, art? Pet. Noâbut I am sent of an everlasting Errand, and will leave the answer to my Executors: I'me for push a pike boy. Pen. Stand close, stand close, here come, the Captains. Enter Eleazer, Skimeon, and Zareck with a Paper in his hand. Elea. The Commons are in arms against us Skimeon, And resolutely take our Fathers part; Yet he, I hear, gives no allowance too't, But thinks with fair perswasions to prevail: But we are arm'd with resolution. Sk. We must be wise my Lord; those aged hairs Are taught by long experience to intrap our younger brains; and this may be a plot to take us at' advantage. Therefore my Lord, in time let me advise that we encrease our forces speedily: Let us make known the Proclamation. Elea. Read the contents of it once again. Zareck reads. Whosoever listeth to be rid from the bondage of his Master, or hath any injury in his Countrey; or what servant soever desireth to be set at liberty; or who so cannot abide the rule of his father or his mother; all that be in debate, and stand in fear of their Creditors, or fear the Iews for shedding innocent blood: If there be any man that is accused of any notorious crime, &amp; in danger therefort: To be short, whosoever is disposed to rob, to haunt Whores, to murder, and to live freely at other mens cost, let him come to me, and I will relieve him. Pet. O rare I am ravished, I am ravished, the wenches, the wenches boy Elea. I do not like the Proclamation, the subject sounds too harsh, and will beget Distractions in the graver Citizens. Skim. Death, what need we care for that, So we be strong for opposition. Elea. Delays are dangerous, and we may be surpriz'd Indeed upon the sudden: wellâlet it be done, But in thy Name, for I must seem to be Vpright and zealous for their liberty. Enter the High Priest and Gorion, the High Priest kneels. Ananias. Behold young man, thy aged Father kneels; And kneels to thee, even unto thee his Son, And begs with tears, with tears of bitterness, the ransom of thy soul, and of the State, Both lost for ever, ever lost if thou persist. Elea. Patience defend me, or I shall be o'recom. Sk. Take heed ye be not caught. Elea. Caught! is't possible for man to view this sight, Apart. this most prodigious sight, and not be caught? O Heavens! Did I not hear him say a was my Father? Have I not heard him beg, and seen him kneel? Had a been Jewries slave, a could have done no more. Is't possible these Rivolets of blood should flow From such a Fountain. Come hither fellow. the Carter comes. Time and Maturity do seem to say thou mayest have been a Father to a Son: tell me, hadst thou e're a son? Go. this passion I hope, wil work some good effect. Pet. Hee'l hang him sure. Cart. Had, I, and have too, an't like your Worship, or chood be zorry. Elea. The power of Nature works as strong in thee As in thy Prince; thou lov'st him too, I know. Cart. By th'mass I zee your Worship's vilely cunning: I do indeed. Elea. Couldst thou afford upon some weighty cause, (Suppose to save thy life, to kneel unto thy son? Car. Kads nails, kneel, I scorn that efaith, Chil make the Looby kneel to me, chil warrant him. El. Come hither; seest thou this old man? Car. Ay. Canst thou believe this man to be my Father? C. Vather ketha, no by my troth not I. El. Vp thou decrepped lump of vanity. thou base impostor that wouldst cheat the world With a supposed Name; thou beastly shame Of Age and Honour, thou indignity Vnto thy self, and thy Posterity. Come, come, disrobe thy self, I say, and yeild Whilst he speaks, he disrobes him. these ornaments to him that scorns to kneel: Here fellow, put um on; put um on, I say, for I will have it so. Let our Proclamation be publisht. Za. It shall my Lord. Exit Elea. Skim. and Zareck at one door, and Anna. &amp; Gor. at the other, weeping, and after them the Carter whistling Pet. 'St Pennel, 'st Pennel. The heighth of his preferment will not let him answer me, Well, I am astonished to think what honor I shall come too. Finis Actus primus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Incipit Actus Quartus. Enter Titus, Valerio, Nicanor. Titus. Now fellow-Souldiers, what? Methinks ye look Not smiling on Vespatians Son. Let not the miss of your old Captain strike Your manly hearts with grief: Come, come let me See your cheerful countenances speak My hearty welcome; Courage noble friends, For know, there's not a dram of worth infus'd Within Vespatians noble loins, but lives Invested here: these lusty Roman veins Swell high as ere did his, with hopeful pride Of happy victory; this loyal brest Harbours a heart as full of Clemency If gently sought unto; but slighted once, the daring Lyon harbours one more mild, More merciful then I. I tell ye Lords, I'le not expect more duty from your hands, then my deserving actions truly weigh'd, Shall justly challenge: And be thus assur'd, My aged Father thus far Ile out-do, there's not a tittle of his former promises to either here, but shall by me be crown'd With fair performance. To witness which, we give you joint Command And Martial Pow'r, as next unto our self. Val. My gracious Lord, the best of my endeavours Shall strive to merit what your noble hand Hath now conferr'd; my hearts best blood my Lord Shall seal my faithful protestation. Ni. My actions, my good Lord, shall better speak My humble thanks, then my unskilful phrase: Mean time your Lordships pardon for my silence. Ti. Tis well: Now I must tell ye Lords, As I have ript my heart to let you see My lifes Compendium. I expect that you Should shape your actions to deserve my love: For I must tell ye Lords, 'tis not a formal shew of gilded words that can perswade me so: Let me behold your brave attempts pursue Imperious victory through seas of blood; Your panting souls in midst of Massacre, thirst after Honour, till the reaking blade cry, 'tis enough. Have ye not seen when in a bloody fray My Noble Father hath been left alone, Alone, begirt with ranks of Enemies, Whose strong Batalio's kept all rescue from him: How then, even then when horror infinite Stood gazing on him with a grim aspect, How then (I say) his daring countenance Stood in defiance of them all at once: How the more danger, still the more he durst, Like a strange Mastiff fiercely set upon by mungril Curs in number ten to one; With angry teeth, and courage bravely bold, A snarles, and snaps; now this, now that doth bite, And stoutly still maintains the unequal fight with equal fury, till the bawling curres be quite disperst: So he, but with such Kingly awful Majesty, as if in midst of this confusion A found but sport of recreation: Such and so daring must you be my Lords, to gain my love, and win your countrey honor. Ni. My Lord, our lives &amp; Fortunes weigh'd with either, We prize at nothing; nor can we desire more felicity then to enjoy the least of either. Va. My honored Lord, your most exact command will teach us Valour had we ne're been train'd in Martial Discipline. Ti. I like your answers wel, saving that yours Valerio, favours too much of flatteryâand yet upon life thou art not that way guilty. And trust me souldiers I am confident Your words and actions will in all points sympathize: But we trifle time, and must redeem it by a strict surveigh of our proceedings. Enter Joseph from Rome. Io. From great Vespatian my most honor'd Lord, I come to do thee humble service. Ti. Now by my life thou'rt welcome, welcome worthy friend; Our Royal Father ne'er could send a man More deer in our affection: Thou com'st as we could wish thee, Ioseph; to morrow we intend to parley with Ierusalem; thy friendly presence may perchance perswade thy Countreymen to yeild subjection: If they refuse, by the Majestick power Of mighty Cesar's sacred Diadem, I'le scourge their pride with such severity, shall make the Rebels curse their misery. Come my endeared friend. Exeunt. Takes Jo. by the hand. Enter Zareck. The three seditious Captains are at odds, Each hunts the other's life; yet all do bear A fair pretence of friendship to each other; Each seeks for soveraignty; whilst, Sinon, I With protestations of integrity And zealous love, do fairly close with all; For being friends to all in time of league, 'twill be a riddle to the wisest pate, Whose love I prized most; then I protest With what obsequious care and toiling pain, My wits are wearied to design a plot Whose wary circumstances may discry All shew of falshood in the enterprize, to trip the heels of either enemy; then shew the time, the place, the manner how to do't: O I am tickled with the fine conceit. My Father in a fair and good estate, Was by these Rebels rob'd and spoil'd of all, And I his son left naked to the world, poor and dejected, till my working brain Projected this employment to relieve me; Since when, I have been busied for revenge: O how methinks that very word Revenge, Allaies the fury of my discontent! But soft; 'tis much about the time they should be here: I will withdraw my self. Zareck stands behind the hangings. Enter Eleazer. I must be wise, and cloath my pleasing phrase, With fair pretence of peace and amity. The blustring wind commands with angry brow, The toiling traveller to leave his Cloak; The storm encreases, but the pelting man Still gripes it faster, till the pleasing Sun By gentle rayes intreats him lay it down. Enter L. Jehochanan and L. Skimeon. Ieho. Good morrow to the Lord Eleazer. A table set, and Zareck stands behind the Arras. Elea. Welcome Iehochanan, welcome noble friends, Come, sit we down, and each man freely speak His cause of grievance: Ah my worthy friends, Dissention is amongst us: Vpon my life I dare presume there is some strange mistake, For else it cannot be that we should differ. Ie. Some strange mistake? Indeed my Lord 'twas strange Your Lordship should mistake your self so much, And us your friends (your friends! nay more my Lord, then friends, For friends are formal now:) the strength of your designs: To send to us a publike messenger to summon us upon command to be Attendants on your Lordships pleasure! My Lord, this was not fair nor friendly. E. Not fair my Lords, nor friendly! which of you that stood in equal terms of honor with my self, Woo'd lose one tittle of that Dignity that fairly rank't his state and quality? Was it for me to say, I woo'd intreat? Was not the Message publike? Had it been private, you should then have seen My fair respect, and friendly love to either. But, as it was my Lordâ L. Skim. Nay, then I must have leave to tell ye Sir, Your Honour swells too high, and must be qualifi'd In equal terms of Honor with your self: My Lord, I dare affirm that Simeon stands In equal terms of honour with your self. Elea. How's that? Sim. Nay good my Lord, your Father's yet alive, And you are then a private man as we. Elea. Thisâis in jest, to see how I can poize A Friends affection, or perchanceâto try the bent of mine. Sim. Your Honour may do well to pass it so, Or else, perchance your Lordship may be angry And thenâhow much your health may be impair'd With such distemper, may perhapsâ Elea. No more. I was not wont to be ridiculous: Nor did I come to hear such airy talk. If this be earnest, let me bear who dares pronounc't agen. Ie. Who dares! that brave reflects on me, that dare stand up to spurn at that, and thee. El. Is't possible! S. Iehochanan, thou dost me open wrong to intercept me: The cause was mine; to me it did belong to give an answer. Wer't thou not who thou art, I should not take this well. Ie. Simeon, I am as deep engag'd as thou, And will have leave to prize mine Honor highest. S. And will have leave! Ie. I say, and will have leave, and say't agen. S. Death, thou dar'st not say't agen. Za. Apart, it works. Ie. Dare not! Elea. I do command ye cease: For shame give o're this rash behaviour: Is this a time to broach a Faction, When Cesars son has conquer'd Galilee, And now is marching to Ierusalem? Ie. And will command my self. E. Villain. Ie. Thou lyest. E. O my inraged soul, must I endure all this? S. All this and more, thou must endure me too. E. Must Simeon? S. I must I say, and shall: Couldst thou dart lightnings from thy countenance, Thus woo'd I meet thee, and out-face thee thus. E. O I am lost in rage, and can endure no longer. They draw, and a trumpet sounds from within. Enter an Herauld. Her. From Cesar's son, brave Lords, I come to say He offers parley to Jerusalem: The time prefixt is the next morning sun Elea. Go tell thy Master we accept it. H. I shall return your answer. Exit. El. This is no time to fight, nor will I now Stand to defend mine honor: But stay, before we sheath our weapons let us swear Howe're our private quarrel may proceed, That we will still maintain each other's part Against Vespatian's son. Both: We are content. E. Your hands. Lay hands on the Sword. By a true souldiers Honour we do swear, Fairly to friend each other in the field, And jointly to oppose Vespatian. Both: We swear to do't. E. The same swear I. I shall expect you both to morrow early. Both: We will not miss the hour. Exeunt at several wayes. Za. The Furies are broke loose, if either fall, Zareck may rise to be a General. Exit. Enter Peter with a Sword and Buckler, leading Gorion manicled with an halter about his neck, apparel'd in a Canvase suit. Pet. Come, come sir, come away sir, come away. G. Nay, prethee friend be not so rigorous, Give me a little time to breathe a while. Pet. Breathe a while! I, I, I'le breathe ye, I warrant ye. Come, come follow me, follow me, I say, Ye shall want for no breathing. Go. Inhumane wretch, I cannot follow thee: Thou hast already wearied out my limbs With thy ingrateful usage. P. Nay, nay, nay sir, all's one for that, Limbs, or not limbs; I say, Follow me. Drags him along, &amp; exeunt. Beat Drom within, and enter Titus, Joseph, Vallerio and Nicanor at one door, and the three Captains at the other, and after them Peter, leading old Gorion in the Halter. P. Come forward I say, a comes like a Bear to the stake. Titus. What means this spectacle of misery? Io. O Titus, 'tis my Father. Wert thou enthral'd in more captivity, Thus low would Ioseph bow to do thee honor. [Jo. kneels, &amp; Go. weeps. I never felt my self so far surpriz'd With sudden passion; Nature is or'e-charg'd, And fain woo'd have some vent. I fear I shall forget my self: Fye Ioseph, fie, apart. Art thou a souldier? Soânow the stream is turn'd. Ti. Now my brave Lords of Jewry, which of you stands chief Commander in this bold Rebellion? Elea. Rebellion, Titus! S. Speak that word agen, And Simeon dares reply that Titus lyes. Ti. Should Titus speak't agen, 'twere still the same, Nor is it less spoke once. Ie. Then know bold Roman, Jewries sons are free, And scorn to bend to Cesar, or to thee. Ti. The sturdy stick that will not bend, must break. E. But not with Titus Arm, nor Cesars too. Jo. Ah dearest countreymen, I come not here to lift mine arm against Jerusalem, But to lament it, Lords; for well I know, the heavens have fore-decreed your overthrow: The great Caldeans Golden Head is laid, the mighty Persians silver Arms are lopt; the Grecians thighs of brass are broken down: What's then remaining but those Iron Legs On which the sturdy Roman Empire stands, And stamps the World to Powder: Ah my Lords Will ye contend with Fate? Iehoc. Peace thou base coward, that to save thy life Hast lost thine honor. Thou com'st with fawning zeal to beg for mercy. Ioseph. To beg for mercy! then mercy ne're protect me. Forgive me Heaven, that I am forc't to draw My sword against my self, my Native countreymen. Draws. Tit. Now by my life they come to brave me here. Rebels, those lordly hearts of yours shall bleed; By all the Gods they shallâ Deliver up that aged prisoner; Or by the Roman Powers ye shall repent it. Schim. Not for the Roman Crown. Elea. Lead him away to torture. Come, come, come away sir, I'le tickle him with tortures. Io. O my distressed Fate! Ti. Villains, there's not a torture you inflict Vpon those aged limbs, but I'le return With millions on your own. Sound Drums, and exeunt omnes. Beat Droms, and they fight within; then enter Joseph and fights with Eleazer, and exeunt. Enter Valerio, and fights with Jehoc. and exeunt. Enter Nicanor, fights with Simeon, and exeunt: The three seditious are repulst: then enter Titus, and meets with Eleazer, they fight: then enter Jehoc. and Simeon as several Doors: Titus fights with the three: Eleazer cryes, kill him: Jehochanan, take him alive: Simeon cryes the second time, kill him: Jehochanan, take him alive. Eleazer the third time kill him: Jehochanan, take him alive. Titus makes way through them wounded, and escapes. E. Death and the Devil, why did ye let him scape? S. O we are finely cheated of the booty, And shall be laught to scorn: Death, I could tear my flesh. Ie. Stand ye to beat the air with idle words? Let's follow close, and find him out agen. Disperse your selves, and follow. Exeunt as several wayes. Enter Peter. Call ye this Honour? a pox of honor, Give me honesty down-right honesty: Souns, break ones head, and give him no warning! I woo'd not have Honor come so fast upon me neither. Looks who comes. Im'e pepperd with a vengeance: Farewel Honor, Ile to my Lady agen. Exit. Enter Titus wounded: Iosephus, Valerio, Nicanor, follow. Io. How fares my Lord? Ti. Well my Iosephus, trust me, passing well: 'tis Titus glory to be bath'd in blood: Now by mine Honor Ioseph, I am glad to see such valour in thy Countrey-men: the charge was hot, and bravely seconded. Didst thou not see where I was forc't to fight, to man the Front, that then began recoile. Io. My Lord I did. Tit. There my brave Lords, mine Honor lay at stake, there was I round begirt with Enemies, and must be ransomed by mine own desert: O my Valerio! then I call'd to mind the great Vespatian: then Tiberius; then mighty Julius: and thenâ Arm'd with disdain and envy, I assail'd the stout Jehochanan, then Skimeon, then Lordly Eleazer, then all; and then Stood all their bold repulses back agen. There I receiv'd these wounds; and then, at last Rapt into rage with fury and revenge, Sweating, and bleeding, in despight of all this arm maintain'd me still a General. But now no more of this: A more convenient time shall fitter serve For this discourse. Come worthy Souldier: Exeunt om. My wounds are stiff, I must retire my self. Enter L. Eleazer with his Rapier drawn. The glorious prey is lost: Puts up his Rapier. Now Eleazer, to thy other business. I do remember wel, a sed, my father was alive: And thenâas if my fathers life were my disgrace, A slighted me with scornâIt must be so, My father must not live: I am resolv'd. Exit. Enter Jehochanan, his Rapier drawn. A pair of pretious Villains! By this light Puts up his Rapier. I laugh to think how finely they are cheated. The Lordly Eleazer woo'd be King; And so woo'd Simeon too. Both aim at me: But I will live in spight of policy. Exit. Enter Simeon wounded. The game is ended, and the Deer escap't; the night draws on apace, and I am hurt. Exit. Enter Eleazer and Zareck. Elea. The time's within this hour: make haste, I say, And fit thy self with instruments of death, Smal pocket-daggers. But be sure thou hast A special care that no o're-reaching eye Detect the plot. Then with a cloak of seeming sanctity, Deject behaviour, visage meanly sad, Eies full of tears; but heart replete with blood: Low bending to my aged father; Sayâ What thy more wary wits shall think upon: But on thy life take heed thou fail not. Zar. Not for the world. Exit Za: Elea. The time draws on apace they should be here. I must disarm my self and wait their coming. disarms Theres something troubles me, all is not well within. I would not see him fall: and yet I must. O Eleazerâbut I forget my self: Exit. A noise of still musick; and Enter the high Priest with attendants, Guards, and Quiresters: they sing. An Alter and Tapers set: See those buildings where once thy glorie liv'd in, with heavenly essence: See how it droopeth, and how nakedly it looketh Without thy presence: Hark how thy captive people mourn With heavy moaning, and grevious groaning, For thy being absent, And for the heathens scorn: Because thy people are by thee forlorn. See those tapers, which once enflam'd those vapours Of our sweet Peace. See those places, where we once injoy'd those graces, Which now do cease. O See the Altar whereas we Enjoy'd those blisses, With heavenly kisses From thy free love, And from thy Clemency: Whilst we did sing to thee mellodiously: Exeunt Quir. H. P. leave us to our Devotion. Enter Za. he bowes to the high Priest, and declares by sighs his sons submission: he lifts up his hands in token of Thankfulness, and weeps. H. P. Thou comst with happie news: go call him in. Calls him. Enter Eleazer, and kneels. E. Ah my much wronged Father! An. This is beyond my hopes: stand up young man: Heaven give thee pardon for thy great offence. Where are thy confederates? E. I would not be o're-heard. A. Dismiss the guard there, we would be private. E. My Lord, I have a secret to disclose, Za. looks if none be coming in. Of such importance, that I fearâ A. I will not be disturb'd, what ere it be. For heavens love let me ha'te. Za. Thou hast thine own desire Stabs him. A. O Eleazer. Za. Tis done. E. Tis bravely done: I will reward the Zareck. Z. Tush, I am happie in the fine exploit. E. Now for the crafty close, puts the dagger into his hand. Conveigh this instrument into his hand. Be brief, be brief, then it may be suppos'd A did this bloody act upon himself. Exeunt. Enter his Atten. and Guard. Atten. My Lordâha!âMurder'd; Curse on that wretched hand that did it: But seeâO see! a gripes the dagger fast That gave the woundâI am amaz'd And know not what to think. Come let us bear him hence. Exeunt CHORVS. Horror, confusion, hunger, plague and Death Have seiz'd our Sacred streets, my fainting breath Fails me to give the sad relation Of sad Judea's desolation. Suppose the famine now to grow extream, Within the City walls; The hungry dream Of food, but tast it not, a Cab is sold Of noisom dung for thrice the weight in Gold? A bloody Sword hangs blazing in the Sky? A Strange and uncouth voice was heard to cry, Come, let's away from hence? the Iron gate Ope's of it self to let in Jewries fate: To tell ye more my aking heart would break, The sad Catastrophe let action speak. Enter L. Jehochanan. The famine is extream; And will beguile of our lives and honors. Enter Chorus. Musick, and the Lady Miriam Sings In her Chamber. Harkâharkâgive ear a while and listen. when the Musick has plaid a while she Sings. The Song. Weep, O weep, mine eyes, a flood of tears: Break, O break, my heart, with endless feares: Fly hence, fly hence, my soul, from such sad grief; Fly hence to heaven, and beg for some relief; Then weeping sing, and singing weep to see Such pretious comfort in thy misery. Ie. This is the Lady Miriam, Shee's rich, shee's rich, exceeding rich And may perhaps have some provision left, I'le in and rifle her. She drawes her window Curten. La. Ay me, the Lord Iehocanan: I fear some violence. Knocks. Pet. Who knocks there? La. keep fast the door. Knocks again. Ie. Ope the door Sirrah, or Ile break it ope. Pet. Marry Sir and Ile break your pate then. Breaks ope the door, and goes in. Enter Peter with head broke. Wars, or not wars, all's one for that, For honor will find me out, I see; I am not so good as my word, hee's better than his, For he has broke the door, and my pate too. But I'le in and save my Lady from ravishing, What ere comes on't: If I take him at it, I'le so pepper him. Exit. Enter Iehochanan with a wallet, dragging The Lady by the hair, and her little Son following weeping. Boy. Now good my Lord even on my knees I beg: Vse not my mother so unkindly. Ie. Peace brawling brat; Confess, confess I say, I know this is not all, Thou hast conceal'd thy best provision La. If there be truth in heaven I have no more, Ah gentle Sir, for pitie take not all, Leave me one loaf to keep my little one. Ie. Not a bit, bold begger. Exit Boy. Good mother weep no more. Exit Lady weeping. Enter Peter. My Lady has sent me to get wormes? But the wormes are more liker for to get me Marry I think if they had me and could speak, They'd curse the Cook that sent u'm such a break-fast; For I am so impenitrable for want of moisture, They had better Seize upon a starv'd Vserer by far: Enter Zaruck. I have observ'd of late a seeming show Of some distempers in Lord Eleazer: His lookes are wild and stareing: something sure Does strangely trouble him. Pe. That's the Captains man that broke my pate. And rob'd my Lady: now is he studying Whose throat he shall cut next; I'de best be gone. I'me pestilence affraid of him. Za. Perchance the murder of his Father troubles him. P. A talkes of murder already. Za. If it be so, I hope 'twill make him mad, Tremble. And I shall be reveng'dâWhat followes that? P. A has spi'd mee, I must stand too't now. Za. What art thou? Pet. What am I; Why I am hungry, very hungry: So hungry, that I could eat my flesh, If I had any flesh to eat. Za. You are very pleasant, Sir. Does the musick of the time cause your wits to daunce. P. Ye say right, Sir. If any part of me daunce, it is my brains, for they are alwayes in action: my legs are far enough from't I me sure. Za. Whither art thou going? P. No whither, ye see, I stand still: I think your wits are daunc't out of your head. Za. Whither wert thou going? P. The man's mad sure: why hither, was I not? Za. Excellent, Ifaith whither wilt thou go? P. Marry they were wise could tell that; I will go whither my legs will carry me: Marry how far that is I cannot tell: For I am altogether for the Carriers pace. I can neither amble, nor trot now. Za. How accurately the knave answers; Tis hunger sure has made his wits so nimble. P. Ye're in the right Sir. For a spare diet, saies your Philosopher, Makes a man fit for study, But sure a meant to get more vittails. Za. Better and betterâfellow, what's thy business? P. What a question's that now? Why look on my Phisnomy, and read it there. Za, I'st written in thy fore-head, knave? P. No, but 'tis written a both sides my face. Z. Extremity of hunger sure has made him mad: P. No, no, no Sir; No such matter: Why hark ye Sir, hark ye; don't you know me? Za. Not I, by this Light. P. I cannot much blame ye, for I hardly know my self; But if I had ne're known your Lord, ye might a knowen me better. Za. Sure that fellow was born with Riddles in's mouth. P. Fare ye well Sir, fare ye well: My Lady said I should get something, though I staid all night: But I'me more liker to stay till dooms-day, for I think I shan't live Till morning; fare ye well Sir. Exit Pet. Za. This is sure the Lady Miriams man, Whom Lord Iehochanan hath lately rifled: Here Comes the Lord Eleazer, I will withdraw. steps aside Enter Eleazer. Elea. Cozen'd and cheated, gull'd and fool'd I am: O man, man, man most miserable! How truly vain, How absolutely base, Are thy lost actions? yet how infinite The Seas of sorrow that thou wadest through, To make thee miserable. Ere thy polluted face was yet produc't, To face of heaven, the wofull womb foretold With griping throws thy native wretchedness: And when thou wert brought forth, what worlds of care And greif, and pains the tender mother takes To bring thee up! what tedious daies and nights Are thrown away upon thine infant age: Thenâwhen thy friutfull branches bear the buds Of hopefull youth! when understanding blooms The beautious blossoms of a riper wit: VVhat daies, and nights, and hours, and minutes spent On tedious papers, whose enigma's dull The slender judgement of the youthfull brain. Till whenâMaturity proclaims thee man Then, loomes this goodly vessel on the main Of mutabilitie, with all the sails Of honour swelling high. But seeâO seeâ A sable cloud of sin with angry brow Threatens distruction, now the Venoms burst: Down with the main-sails ere the gust aproach, Alas, 'tis now too late, all's over whelm'd, Turn'd upside down, the pretious lading lost, The shipwrack't soul, for ever, ever lost in lake of death, Eternall death: Woo'd I Had been destroyd within the house of sin, The cursed wombe, or been abortive born, Ne're to have seen that hatefull light that sees My wretched fall. Curst be the fantacy that shap't the thought Of my conception, ten times curst the act? The lustfull act! ten thousand times the hour Of my nativity: may that ever be An hour of horrour, plague, and misery. Za. it works it works Enter the Lady Miriam Lady. For charity, good courteous Sir, take pitie on a poor distressed Lady: Even for the love ye bear unto the womb that bred ye. She kneels Elea. The Love I bear? the love I bear is hate. Hate most unatterable. so inveterate, That I could curse my primogenitors, S'fut I could curse my father Adam too. La. A lass Sir I am rob'd and spoild of all.

Ha, ha, ha, heres sport alone for mee, The murder of his father troubles him With ghastly apparitions: horrour and despair Pursue thy guilty soul, til I may see My ful revenge in thy calamity. Exit. Agen, agen, agen, without I saw Eleazer rises. The Furies here; the sudden apparition Has so appal'd my guilty soul, that I Am lost in terror; all my Vitals shrink With ghastly fear, my intermissive pulse Speaks the disorder of my panting heart: No comfort for a poor distressed man! Down, down rebellious knees; so stubborn still! I bear a burden of such massie weight Woo'd crack the mighty Axletree of Heaven, Yet cannot force these sturdy limbs to bend: My Ovens mouth is damm'd with dirty sin, No vent for sorrow; not a peeping-hole To steal a dram of comfort for my soul. OâEleazer thou art lost for ever. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Enter VALERIO. What a Devil ails the General! I have observ'd in him of late a strange and uncouth Carriage to his near attendants: His looks distracted, and his words compos'd With strange disturbanceâSure all is not well: But I'le observeâ Enter Titus, crosses the stage, and exit with an angry look upon Valerio. Val. Death, what should this mean? Enter Nicanor. Ni. Valerio? Well met; saw'st thou the General lately? Val. Yes, I have seen him lately, Heaven bless me from the sight of him agen. Ni. Why man, what's the matter? Val. Whats the matter! Why a has star'd me into such a strange distemper, I shall not be my self this hour agen. A looksâlike Vulcan, when his fiery face Looks red (with rage) upon the Rival God: A walksâby sembreefs, with such stately gait, As if a scorn'd to tread on Cesars Earth. A speaksâby riddles, and such strange enigmae's, that sure 'two'd pose old Oedipus to answer. Hast not thou seen him in this musty mood? Ni. Yes, yes, yes, I have seen him, and felt him too, Pox on's fingers for't. He askt me last night what store was in the Magazine: I told himâabout a Months provision. A steps him backâand staresâand stampsâand saysâ What?âIs't possible?â, No more? Why dost not speak?âNo more, I say? Art sure there is no more? Death woo't not speak? and then his truncheon walks; s'fut had I not warded wel I had been mall'd, I knew not what to say; And then a call'd me sot, and went his way. Va. Now by this hand I am lighter by a Roman dram, to hear thee in for a share too: Why now I could sing, or daunce, Or rime, or jest, or do any thing. Stand, stand thou here, and I will act the General. And do thou speak to me as if he were in presence. Ni. Content. Val. Nicanor! Ni. My Lord. Val. Come hither: What store of prisoners were taken in the skirmish? Ni. My Lordâ Ni. My Lord! what nothing but my Lord! Souns, must I dance attendance on your answer. Strikes him. Now sirâwhat my Lord?â Ni. Souns, what d'ye strike me? Va. Fye, fye, vilely spoken, very vilely spoken, Ask his Lordship why a strikes? Why this favours of too much arrogance, and woo'd incense him beyond measure: Ye should rather have said, My Lord, I am sorry I have trespast on your patience, Or I crave your Lordships pardon for my dulness, Or the like. Ni. Pox a patience, and your Lordship too, Why did ye strike me so hard? Val. Out upon't, worse and worse by this light, Limit his Lordship how hard to strike! Why this were to tell his Lordship what to do, How to command, and where to punish: this woo'd not be endur'd. Ni. I prethee leave thy jesting, Or by this light I shall fall out in earnest, and let your Lordship know I am displeased. Val. Well I have done; but prethee canst thou tell the cause of this distemper? For in himself (what e're hath alter'd him) He is a Captain of as mild a nature, As brave Command, and of as sweet converse, as Rome hath ever bred. Ni. Faith I am ignorant, nor can I judge the cause. Butâ Val. Peace, the General. Enter Titus. Ti. Valerio! Val. My Lord? Ti. Come hither; nearerâyet nearerânearer yet I say, Souns, must I trumpet my Oration? Or dost thou think my throat's an Organ-pipe? There has been lately a great out-rage done within the Camp; know you ought of it? Val. Not I my Lord. Ti. Take heed I trap thee not, upon thy life take heed: By Heaven if I doâ I say agen, there has been lately acted A most inhumane murderâon the Jewsâ the Captive Jews that fled to us for mercy; Know'st thou ought yet? V. My Lord, I know not ought, nor ought have everheard of this inhumane act. Ti. Nor you? why dost not speak? speak I say. Death, if I ask agenâ Ni. My Lord, Nor I. Ti. Nor I!âwhat nor I? Death, are ye so sparing of your speech sir? Take heed I do not frame an answer for thee; By Heaven if I do, 'twill cost thee dear the penning. Ni. My gracious Lordâ Ti. Comma. Ni. I amâ Ti. Comma. Ni. Altogetherâ Ti. Colon. Ni. Ignorantâ Ti. Period. Troth I believe thee. Ni. Of this proceeding: Ti. What's all this put together now? Ni. My Lord! Ti. My contumelious Coxcomb, Why was not this mishapen answer given without distraction? If thy soul be clear, Why did thy guilty looks proclaim thee evil? Why didst thou vail the face of honesty, and innocence, within the mask of fear? Thou wert begotten sure in some distraction, When Nature was disturb'd to get a man: Goâget thee hence, and get more Faithâbut yet look to't, look to't I say, for if I find thee guilty, thy life shall pay the ransome of thy sin: Goâget thee henceâstay, read that, going away. and read it out. He reads. A Catalogue of the Massacre of the Captive Captive Jews, who fled to us for mercy Vnder Valerio's Squadron, four hundred. Vnder Nicanor's, five hundred. Murdred out of the camp and ript for their Jewels VVhich they had swallowed for fear of rifling eleven hundred; The whole number amounting to two thousand. Ni. This is strange my Lord. Gives him the Paper. Ti. Yes, 'tis wondrous strange that we Whose Princely-Valour, Power and Clemency the world admires, should be so foul abus'd, Abus'd by you, by you I say abus'd, And say't agen: Deathâif, twere not so, who durst attempt? attempt! durst think to do An act so foul, so most inhumane? Have we not given the sole command to you? and you to do what you think fit? And must we have our Honor now traduc't, Trampled, and trod upon, through your neglect? Must we, when we have past our princely word For fair protection, have our Subjects snatcht By such discorder from our Princely bosom? By heaven this is not well; I say it is not, Look too't: look too't, I say, I hear no more of this, For by a Romans honour if I doâgo to I say, look too't: Va. Now by my life but this is wondrous strange, Exit Two thousand Jews destroi'd and we not know't: Ni. Tis so; nor can I blame the General To be distemperd. But now the storm is over, Let us by strict inquiry search the truth: Perchance he may be mis-inform'd, and we abus'd: Va. Content, let us about it. Exeunt Enter the Lady Miriam with a knife in her hand. How tedious are our daies of miseries, And yet how breese the means to cut them off? What multitudes of Wretched dayes and nights, In whose each minute the affrighted soul Lives on the wrack of grief and discontent, Who'd this smal instrument of death dispatch: And why do I then; VVretched I, protract My dayes of misery? I'st not enough that I have liv'd to see My parents slain by native crueltie? My countrey Sackt? and my religion Scorn'd, My self forsaken, and my stripling live To ask me food, and I not so food to give?

TushâI am deceived; Henceforward I nor God, nor good wil know: Religion is a thing fantasticall, And heaven and hell are meer Poeticall: Hence coward fear, tis thou that dost command Mine arm to slack. thou makst my shaking hand Let fall the fatal instrument of death: I will no more be subject to thy Law But in a minuteâ Goes to stab her self agen Alas how cruell mercifull am I, To free my self from sad calamity, And leave my pretty child to suffer more, Ile kill him firstâand that once bravely done, Ile kill the mother that has kild her son: Enter boy How swift occasion tempt us to do evil?

Yes, very sick indeed, and feeble too; So feeble, I have much adoe to go. La. Had'st thou not rather die, then live In this extremity? Boy. Alas good mother, I am loath to die, I wood fain live to see you get some food. La. would'st therefore live, my boy, Why thou shalt be my food: When I have kill'd thee, I will feed on thee.

O hold, pray hold your hand: Kneels My duty shall observe ye ten times more Then ever my obedience did before. Weeps agen La. How hard a pleads for life; the Gentle Phrase Begins to mollifie my cruell breast. In what a sad dilemma stands my choise: Affection bids me spare; affliction strike: Nor can I well approve? nor yet dislikeâ Of eitherâSomething must be done: Forgive me heaven, for I must kill my Son. Boy. OâI am Kill'd indeed, farewell. She stabs him La. That well sound's ill:âtis doneâit may be no, For still a sturs, and stursâbut now tis done indeed.

Tis very hot too: reaking hot; so hot It Scaldes the cunduit pipes of life, Fryes all my vitalls into Ãtna's flames, And makes a bonfire of my burning heart. My Spoongy bellows that were wont to blow Cool fannings to my bodies center, Are Suffocate with Sulphrous heat. no crany left To cool a tortur'd Soul. Go fetch me Vulcans bellows, they'l doo't sure; Orâif not they, I'll force a passage through this house of clay, and let in air Att. Lay hands upon him till the fit be past. E. These flaming Lampes burn red with fury rage To feel my marrow broil; my singed scull Reverberates the fury to my brain, And makes me mad. All this whole mass of man Is metamorphis'd to confusion. Hurry me strait unto the Eolean cave, That Boreas may bore me through and through There shall ye see this active torrid Zone Tug for the mastry with the windy King; That fire with air, and air with fire may burn, Till fire and air do into Chaos turn.

Of your Philosophers, give me Pythagoras, For all the rest are fools: meer fools: dee mark me Sir, Why may not this same windy soul of mine, Make musick in a musty midwife?

Enter Time bearing an Escutcheon, six Roman Champions crown'd with Lawrel follow, each bears an Escutcheon: Jehochanan and Simeon follow guarded: Time presents his Escutcheon to the General. Tit. What's here? six Roman Champions leading the world captive; the Motto: Not one, but all: subscrib'd. Times winged speed doth here present Six Moral Virtue's fair Event. Six Roman Champions, whilst they live, to these Six Virtues harbour give. The Champions present their Escutcheons in order. Tit. Piety pourtraied in a black Manile, in her less hand a Stork, an Embleme of reciprocal love, her right arme stretchs over an Altar, with a sword in her hand, to shew her resolution for Religion: the Motto, Semper eadem. Your inventions have done well to give this Virtue priority, For 'tis the Basis of our glorious actions: the firm foundation that our Numa laid When first a did ordain the Vestal-sites: It would have been more proper had ye limm'd her Smiling, and pointing to a sumptuous house Built on the rowling sand: the Motto this, Sine me peris imperisa: well, the next. Temperance decipher'd in a white Robe, with a sober countenance, in her left hand a Cornucopia, with this Motto, In abundantia abstemio: the next. Chastity pictur'd in a green Robe, a Lion couching by her file, the points to a Lilly: the Motto, Pares nos sumus. Friendship binding a fardle of sticks together: the Motto, Concordia regnaflorent. Constancy depainted in a purple Robe, her left: hand pointing to the Moon, her right to her Bosom: the Motto, Mutabile quicquid extra, nil intus. Patience limm'd in a Violet Robe, pointing toâmee: Hah, is't not so 'tis so: the Motto, Dispares nos sumus, and under, Sat cito si sat bene: This was a good conceit, it likes me passing well: For now I see, my Lords, yee will not flatter me; Well, I'le indevour to amend it, Lords: Come, now to your sports. Musick, and they dance: the Mask ended, Time presents the Prisoners, and exeunt. Jehoch. Mercy, my gracious Lord. The Prisoners kneel. Titus. What stately Prisoner's hee, that wears the Diadem. Jo. My honor'd Lord, this is the cruel Simeon; And this Jehochanan. Tit. What! art sure tis he? Jo. Most certain, mighty Prince. Sim. Mercy, my honor'd Lord. Tit. Look down, look down, ye powers above, and see the basest scum of all mortality. Is't possible to see the Villains kneel, And beg? Seaven daies together let the Slaves be led In triumph; to be mockt, and scorn'd, and kickt; And each day tortur'd to extremity, then put them to an ignominious death. Si. Curses and plagues reward thee. Exeunt Prisoners and Guard. Ti. Now worthy Gorion thou hast liv'd to see thy self reveng'd of all thine injury. Gor. Ah my good Lord! I joy not in revenge, that I must leave to heaven. Shout within. Ti. Enquire the cause of that shout. 1. Attendant. More prisoners brought, my Lord. Ti. Let them have entrance. Enter Officers leading Zareck and the Lady Miriam Prisoners, another following leading Peter with an halter about his neck, the Lady weeps. 1. Officer. Come along Sir, come along; you have no stomach to go too't. Pees. I have more stomach beha'fe to eat, if I had some vittails: hark ye Sir, pray do not pull too hard, least ye pull my head off; it's held on by nothing but skin and dry bones, the marrow is wasted long since; I believe I shall never hold the hanging. Tit. What Lady's that, whose sad behaviour speaks such discontent? Gor. Ah Noble Titus, to relate the story Of her sad fate, will prove a task too weighty For a woful breast to utterâ Let others speak her sad calamity, Weeps. For me it is enough to weep her misery. Titus. Rise up distressed woman: by all that's good, Lady Kneels. I joy not in so sad a spectacle. Tell me thy cause of grievance: If there be A way to make thee happy, leave it to me, And I will see thee righted. Lady. A way to make me happy? ay me poor wretch: the world to me is a distastfull thing, Full of affrighting Objects: pensive thoughts and fears, Horrors, amazements, anguish, greefe and tears, Attend my restless hours: no room is left For the least hope of comfort: no starting hole to ease the torture of a wearied soul. She weeps Ti. Know'st thou this Lady, Ioseph. Io. My honor'd Lord, this is the Lady Miriam: Extracted from a noble family: the sad Epitome of grief and misery: the wofull mother of a murther'd son. Titus. Murther'd? by whom? Lady Miriam. By me, by this accursed arme, entombed here within the wretched womb that gave it life. She weeps Peter. Me thinks I feel a great toe stir in my stomack now. Lady. Ah my dear son! thy wounds bleed fresh In my remembrance: the bloudy act Sits sad upon my soul : affrights my guilty breast, Distracts my working brain: Iustice, my Lord: I cry for Justice against my cruel self, And must not be denied it. She weeps Titus. The vnpleasing Spectacle disturbs me, Lead her away, and see her safely kept, And gently vs'd; let wariest eyes Attend her actions, least shee offer Violence to her unhappy self. La. Were I at liberty for that, I would not linger out a moment; I hate to live, and yet I fear to dy By mine own hand; for Heavens love let meâ Titus. Lead her away; and comfort her. Lady. Ah! be not so vnkind: can ye for pitty see a Caitiff on the wrack of misery, and not relieve her. Weeps. Gorion. Passion I fear will overcom me, if she persist in this extremity. Lady. Open a passage to my guilty soul, and send it to eternal vengeanceâor if there be one drop of mercy left for misery, post me to heaven to begg itâ Weeps Titus. My soul relents to see thy sad condition. Peter. Thats old gray-beard, that was led a way Eyes Gorion. by me to tortures, if he remembers me, I go to pot: 'if Madam, Lady, Madam, Speak a good word for me. Titus. What's he that wears that livery of Death? Gorion. A servant to the Lady Miriam, the very same that led my aged limbs to torture, but by cumpulsion of the rebel Iews: I therefore humbly beg his pardon. Peter. I, I, I, must to't, now a has spy'd me. Titus. Come hither sirrah. Peter. Now I go, now I go, now I go, Lady, madam: Titus. Although I know thee to be guilty of an offence Deserving death; yet for thy Ladies sake, And this good man's, I give thee life and liberty: Loose him, and leave him to his lady's service: See thou be careful of her preservation. Lady. Ay me most miserable. They take the Halter off. Peter. O rare! now could I leap out of my skin for Joy. Come away Madam, come away: the sight of the halter makes my stomack wamble. Come away, I say. Zareck. A ha, ha, ha, ha; Confusion play thy part, And hatch up mischeif to the highest strain Of mans invention. Titus. What daring prisoner's he, Whose uncouth laughter scorns at misery? Iosephus. The most unheard of piece of villany that ever Nature gave a being to: this is that cursed wretch that blew the coles Of hot dissention 'twixt the Citizens: that murdred the high Priest, and promted on the three seditious Captains to ambition; that rob'd this wretched Lady, and gave fire to Jewries sacred temple. Titus. Villain, What saist thou for thy self? Is all this true? Peter. A broke my pate too. Za. Ha, ha, ha,âall this! all this and ten times more all this is nothing, not the thousand part Of my unknown designs: did'st thou but know the danger that is in me, thou wouldst not venture me So near thy person. Titus. Halter him, and lead him to the wrack. Let him be tortur'd with the greatest rigour Can be invented. They halter him. Za. Ha ha ha haâCould'st thou devise As many tortures as have e're bin born By all the sons of Adam; thus wood I slight Spurns at it. Both them and thee.â Tit. I shall unmask this hellish bravery: Lead him away, I say. Zar. Thou canst not, Roman, in spight of cruelty, Zareck will triump in the Victory. Officers. Come along Sir, come along. Pet. Hark yee Sir, when ye begin to cry Ohâ Remember whose pate yee broke, Sir. Zar. Peace, Babler. Exeunt Officers with Zareck. Tit. Come honor'd friends, upon a Romans word Ye're nobly welcome: let not Jewrys fall Descends his throne. Dismay your Princely hearts: Romes General Will find a way to raise your ruin'd State. The gods are just; we must submit to fate: Take care of that distressed Lady. Pet. Now do I long to see the Captains at it. Exeunt omnes, the Lady weeping. Finis Actus Quinti.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGVS. The lofty Buskin, and the learned Bay, Are not exspected to adorn our Play; Our Author deemeth these fair trophies fie To grace the raptures of a riper wit.
