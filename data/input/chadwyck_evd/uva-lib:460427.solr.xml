      <field name="fulltext">THE UNINHABITED ISLAND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Constantia, Wife to Gernando. Sylvia, her younger Sister. Henriques, Friend to Gernando. Gernando, Husband to Constantia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene in a small Island.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. A pleasant part of a small and uninhabited Island with a prospect of the sea: several trees of a foreign growth, rude caves and grottoes, with shrubs and flowers. On the forepart of the stage, to the right hand, is a great rock on which is an unfinished inscription in European characters. Constantia alone, wildly apparelled with skins, leaves and flowers, with the hilt and broken part of a sword in her hand, appears employed in finishing the Inscription. What task so arduous, but unwearied toil At length effects! Hard is this stubborn rock, Rude is this instrument, and weak the hand That inexperienc'd guides it: yet behold My long laborious work how near complete. Grant me to finish this! then, gracious Heaven! Release me from a life replete with sorrows. Should Fortune e'er, in future times, transport Some traveller to tread these shores unknown, This rock at least shall from oblivion's power Preserve my sufferings, and record my story. [reads.] âConstantia, by Gernando's guile betray'd, âForsaken here, on this far-distant coast, âClos'd the sad remnant of her wretched days. âWhoe'er thou art, that read'st these mournful lines, âIf savage fierceness dwell not in thy breast, âRevenge or pityâ ââmy distastrous fate.â These words alone are wanting: let me then Conclude what yet remains to crown my toil. [returns to her work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. Enter Sylvia, in haste. Syl. My sister, my Constantia! [with joy. Cons. What imports Thy breathless haste, and whence my Sylvia's transport? Syl. O! my lov'd sister! I am wild with joy! Cons. But say the cause. Syl. My dear, my lovely fawn, So many days deplor'd and sought in vain, Is now return'd. Cons. And hence thy mighty rapture? Syl. And think'st thou this so little? Well thou know'st My fawn's my care, my darling and my friend: She loves her Sylvia: when I speak, methinks She hears me with a more than brutal sense. She sleeps upon my bosom, courts my kisses, And still attends me whereso'er I go. Her had I lost, her have I found again, And think'st thou this so small a cause of joy? Cons. O! happy innocence! [returns to her work. Syl. Shall I, my sister, For ever hear thy sighs and see thy tears? Cons. And can I ever dry these weeping eyes? Full thirteen times has spring renew'd its course, Since thus abandon'd, and secluded far From human race, depriv'd of every comfort, O Heaven! without one glimmering hope again To view my lost, my dear paternal shores, Here have I dwell'd and dragg'd a dying life: And would'st thou, Sylvia, have me yet unmov'd? Syl. But what have we to ask to make us happy? Are we not sovereigns here? This pleasing isle Our peaceful kingdom, and the forest herds Our gentle subjects? Earth and sea produce Supplies for us: the friendly trees afford A grateful shelter from the burning heat; And hollow caves defend us from the cold: Our will is uncontroll'd by force or law: If this suffice not, say what more remains To make us blest? Cons. Alas! thou canst not miss The good thou ne'er hast known. When first we reach'd These lonely shores, thy lips could scarcely utter Imperfect sounds, thy young ideas then Unform'd and unconnected: thy remembrance Preserves no trace of what we once have been, No object knows but what this isle affords. I, who was then, as thou art now, remember (O! cruel recollection!) what I was, And, with my present state, compare the past. Syl. Oft have I heard you boast the wealth, the wisdom, The arts, the manners and delights of Europe; And yet permit me to declare my thoughts, This peaceful life for me has greater charms. Cons. Think not description, Sylvia, will inform thee Of what from sight thou only canst conceive. Syl. And yet these boasted lands are fill'd with manâ With man, whose species is our deadly foe; And have you not a thousand times declar'dâ Cons. True, I have told thee oft; but ne'er enough Of that detested race. Yes, men are cruel, Perfidious, impious, treacherous, more than savage, Strangers to ties of soft humanity; [weeps. Love, faith and pity dwell not in their breast. Syl. Then here from them at least we live secure; And yetâyou weepâO! if you love your Sylvia, Forbear this grief. What can I do to ease you? Do you desire my fawn? Dry up those tearsâ My fawn shall then be yours. [takes her hand. Cons. Alas! my Sylvia, Constantia has too just a cause for tears. [embracing her. If I, who by my treacherous spouse Here banish'd from mankind remain, If I'm forbid to weep my woes, O Heaven! what wretch must then complain? But who shall dare condemn my grief, With every anguish here oppress'd, And even denied the poor relief Of pity from a friendly breast? [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. A ship appears at a distance under sail. Sylvia alone. How obstinate her plaints! Her constant sorrow Afflicts my tender heart: fain would I sooth her; But prayers, advice and chidings all are vain; And stranger still, whene'er I offer comfort, Her tears increase and I'm compell'd to weep: Yet let me still pursue herâ [going she sees the ship. Heavens! what means Yon towering bulk, that rises o'er the sea? 'Tis not a rockâa rock remains unmov'd: And can so vast a monster cut the flood With such a rapid motion? See, behind The parted waves are white; its speedy course Outstrips the gazing eye, while on its back It bears huge wings, and swims at once and flies. Constantia shall instruct me; she can tell If yonder form is not some wondrous being That holds its dwelling in the faithless deep. At least she knowsâ [Gernando and Henriques are seen to leave the ship, descend into the boat and land.] Ye powers! what do I see! O! who are these that now have reach'd the shore? What shall I do, and whither turn for aid? My breast is chill'd with fear, I scarce have strength To fly, or hide me from the approaching danger. [hides herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IV. Gernando, Henriques, in Indian habits; Sylvia apart. Hen. Is this the land, Gernando, we have sought? Ger. Even this, my friend: its well-known image here, Remains engraven by the hand of Love: My beating heart confirms it for the same. Syl. [looking out.] Might I but view their faceâ Hen. Perchance, my friend, We yet may be deceiv'd. Ger. No, my Henriques, This is the fatal place, I well remember Each craggy rock. Behold the cave, where laid In gentle sleep, with Sylvia in her arms, I left my wife, the treasure of my soul! I left her, never to behold her more. 'Twas there the pirate-band assail'd me first; I here receiv'd my wound; there from my hand The weapon dropp'd. O! let us haste, my friend, For each delay is criminal. Do thou Yon' quarter visit, this to search be mine. This island stretches but to small extent, Nor can we wander far. My heart, alas! Has scarce a hope to find Constantia here. Yet fate at least one comfort shall afford; That precious earth which holds her breathless corse, Shall form Gernando's tomb. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. Henriques, Sylvia apart. Syl. To their discourse In vain I've listen'd. Hen. Hapless is the fortune Of poor Gernando; scarce his hand receives His lovely bride, when call'd to distant climes He trusts himself and all he prizes most, Amidst the faithless deep; then landing here To seek refreshment for his tender partner O'er-spent and wearied by the tossing surge, While sleep seals up her sense, by ruffian force Is hurried hence to distant lands unknown, Where many years he sighs a wretched captive, And hears no tidings of the fair he mourns. Syl. At length he turnsâhow pleasing is his mien! Hen. Compassion pleads for him in every breast, And gratitude in mine. To him I owe Freedom, the first the noblest gift of Heaven. 'Twere cruelty in others not to mourn His fate, in me 'twere base ingratitude. The heart that feels not for another's woe, Is shunn'd by all; but most the ungrateful mind Is justly held in universal horror. The tender tree, though not indu'd With gentle sense of human woes, Is grateful to the parent flood From which its genial moisture flows. For this he yields a kind return, And thick in verdant leaves array'd, When scorching beams of PhÅbus burn, Defends the stream with friendly shade. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. Sylvia alone. What have I seen? It cannot sure be man; Its looks would then betray its native fierceness. Men all are stern and treacherous, and their aspect Must bear some semblance of the wicked heart. Nor is't a woman, for the garb it wears Is fashion'd not like mine or my Constantia's. Whate'er it be, it has a pleasing form: My sister shall resolve meâHa! my feet Refuse to move, O Heaven! why do I sigh? What means my beating heart? Can it be fear? Noâwere it fear I should not find this pleasure; Far different is the passion which I feel, This nameless something fluttering in my breast. New joys I find and yet complain Amidst a sweet and pleasing pain; Those looks, alas! but vainly please; What gives me pleasure gives not ease. I run a thousand fancies o'er, Delightful hopes unknown before! And yet I know not whence I sigh, Or what my distant hopes imply. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VII. Gernando alone, appearing fatigued. Alas! my mind presag'd her fate too well. Vain are my toils: in vain I seek and call Her much-lov'd name: these eyes perceive not yet The smallest track of her my soul adores. But where's my friend? Perhaps more fortunateâ What ho! Henriques!âLet me seek himâHeaven's I can no furtherâweariness and grief Weigh down my strengthâhere on this friendly rock I'll rest awhile and wait for his returnâ [drawing near, sees the inscription. What see I? European characters! Almighty powers! behold my name inscrib'd! Whence this inscription, from what hand unknown? [reads.] âConstantia, by Gernando's guile betray'd, âForsaken here, on this far-distant coast âClos'd the sad remnant of her wretched days.â âO! Heavens! I faintâ [leans against the rock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VIII. Enter Henriques. Hen. Speak comfort, my Gernando; Yet know'st thou aught of poor Constantia's fate? Ger. Constantia's dead. Hen. What says my friend? Ger. Read there. [points to the inscription. Hen. [reads the first part of the inscription to himself, then exclaims.] Unhappy fate! [reads the remainder aloud.] âOn this far-distant coast âClos'd the sad remnant of her wretched days. âWhoe'er thou art, that read'st these mournful lines, âIf savage fierceness dwell not in thy breast, âRevenge or pityââ There the sentence stands Unfinish'd. Ger. There her vital spirits fail'd. [falls in an agony on the rock. Hen. O! tragic issue of disastrous love! Yes, weep Gernando, for thy tears are just. Mine too shall flow in sympathy with thine, Even rocks shall feel thy grief. But yet, my friend, 'Midst all thy woes one comfort still remains, (Nor think that comfort little) no remorse Preys on thy soul: thou hast fulfill'd each duty Which love, or faith, or reason could require; But Heaven was pleas'd to render vain thy cares. No more remains, but with a pious mind To bend submissive to this awful stroke, And fly, as wisdom bids, these fatal shores. Ger. Forsake these shores! And whither must I turn? Where dost thou think I more shall find repose? O no!âhere Heaven has fix'd my last abode: Here on this spotâ Hen. What means my friend? Ger. While life Informs my breast, I'll breach the vital air Constantia breath'd: each object here shall feed My faithful grief: each moment I'll return And kiss this rock; here live in lingering pain With her dear name for ever on my lips, And dying here, complete my cruel fate. Hen. O! my Gernando, what hast thou resolv'd? Would'st thou abjure thy country and thy friends, Thy father worn with yearsâ Ger. To see me thus, Would bow his reverend head to earth with sorrow. Then go, my friend, give comfort to his age; Be thou for me a son; and if he seek To know my fortune, spare a parent's ear, Soften the tale, and speak but half my sufferings. Hen. And canst thou hope that e'erâ Ger. My friend, farewell. Attempt not, while my sorrows flow, With empty words to sooth my woe: No mortal shall my anguish share; I ask no partner but despair. In these abodes, ah! what relief Would kind compassion yield to grief? A friend would but increase my pain, And swell the grief he felt in vain. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IX. Henriques alone. We must not yet oppose his rage of sorrow, But let his passions by degrees subside; Then, should he still persist in his design, Force must be us'd to bear him henceâWhat ho! Some seamen sure attend with yonder bark: Come forth, my friends. [two seamen enter. Hear and observe my purpose. We must by force remove Gernando hence, Who, lost in grief, refuses to depart. You know where midst yon rocks the limpid stream Winds its smooth course: that place, o'ergrown with wood, Seems form'd for ambush; there, 'till he appears, Conceal'd await; then instant rushing forth, Seize and convey him to your ship.âAway! [Exeunt seamen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE X. Enter Sylvia. Syl. [entering.] Where is Constantia? Still I've sought in vain: For I have much to tell her. Hen. [turning to Syl. Sure I dream! What wonder strikes my sight! Stay, beauteous nymph. Syl. O Heavens! art thou return'd? [about to fly. Hen. Why would'st thou fly? O! hear me but a moment. Syl. Say, what would'st thou? [from the side of the scene. Hen. But gaze upon thee; speak a few short words, No more. Syl. Then, ere thou speak'st, give me thy promise To come not near me. Hen. Fear not, lovely maid, I promise this. [retiring further off. What graceful innocence Through all her frame! Syl. How gentle are its looks! [going nearer. Hen. But what's in me to cause such mighty terror? I am no asp, nor savage beast of prey: A man can surely not affright thee thus. Syl. [disturbed.] Art thou a man? Hen. I am. Syl. [flying.] O! save me! save me! Hen. [staying her.] Yet stay. Syl. [kneels.] O! spare meânever have I wrong'd you: Then be not cruel to me. Hen. [raising her.] Rise, my fair-one, Compose thy thoughts; this causeless fear distracts me. Syl. [aside.] Sure my heart whispers I may trust his faith. Hen. O! if thou art gentle, as thy form bespeaks thee, Say when and where did poor Constantia die? Syl. Constantia? Heaven be prais'd, Constantia lives. Hen. She lives!âO lovely Sylvia!âYes, this place, Thy tender years, all tell me thou art Sylvia. Fly to Constantia, while I haste as swift To seek Gernando. Syl. Hast thou then with thee That cruel, that ingrate? Hen. Call him unhappy, But not ingrate or cruelâO! delay not, 'Twere barbarous to defer, but for a moment; The tender raptures of this faithful pair. Syl. Together let us go. Hen. No, that would ask A longer time than suits our present purpose. Seek thou Constantia, bring her to this place, And with Gernando hither I'll return. [going. Syl. Yet stay awhileâWhat is thy name? Hen. Henriques. Syl. [tenderly.] Then hear, Henriques, tarry not too long. Hen. What means this haste, my fair? Syl. Alas! I know not: I feel a sudden damp at thy departure, And feel, at thy return, as sudden joy. Hen. And, witness Heaven, I could for ever hear thee, Gaze on thy sweets, and dwell with thee for ever. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE XI. Sylvia alone. What can this mean? He's gone, but still remains Before my eyes: he's gone, but still my thoughts Pursue where'er he goes. Why am I thus Disturb'd, yet know not where this passion tends? What is this, alas! I prove, Pain or pleasure at my heart? If 'tis pain that thus can move, O how pleasing is the smart. 'Tis a pain that lulls to rest, Every other thought disarms, Yet awakens in my breast New desires and soft alarms. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE XII. Constantia alone. Time o'er me flies with pitying wings, But Time to me no comfort brings: Though trees and rocks with years decay, My sorrows ne'er shall pass away. Still here I live, and mourn in vain A life of slow-consuming pain. O! let me yield at once my breath, And lay me gently down in death. [seats herself in a melancholy posture on the trunk of a tree, repeating the first part of the air. While absence hence, in thoughtless innocence My Sylvia wanders, let this hand resume Its melancholy labour. [returns to her work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE XIII. Enter Gernando. Ger. [not seeing Cons.] While my friend Leaves me alone to grief, here let me turn And kiss this precious rockâ [sees Cons. But ha! what would Yon female form, and whence? What can this mean? Cons. [not seeing him.] Perchance, Constantia, all thy toil is vain, And what thou here hast wrought shall ne'er be known. Ger. Constantia! O, ye powers! my wife! [embracing her. Cons. [turning, she knows him.] Ah! traitor! I can no moreâ [falls in a swoon upon the rock. Ger. My life!âShe hears me not!â O Heaven! her senses failâSome cooling streamâ Where shall I findâNot distant hence I view'd A crystal rivuletâbut must I leave My treasure thus alone?âYes, one short moment Will bring me back impatient to her sight. [Exit hastily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE XIV. Constantia in a swoon. Enter Henriques. Hen. [entering.] My friend, who knows not yet his happiness, Conceals himself from meâWhere shall I turn To trace his steps?âBut see! on yonder rock Some nymph reposesâ'Tis not SylviaâHeavens! 'Tis then ConstantiaâWhat a mortal paleness O'erspreads her languid face! Cons. [coming to herself.] Ah me! Hen. Constantia? Cons. [without looking at him.] O! leave meâleave me. Hen. Banish this despair, And live to crown thy consort's faithful love. Cons. Hence, traitor! let me, let me die in peace. Hen. A traitor!âsure thou know'st me not. Cons. [sees him.] Ye powers! Where is Gernando? Art thou not the same? Did I but dream before, or dream I now? Hen. Thou didst not dream before, nor dream'st thou now: Thou hast indeed beheld thy own Gernando, And now thou see'st his friend. Cons. And could he then Return again to his forsaken wife, To whom his crueltyâ Hen. Alas! thy husband Forsook not thee; but hence, by ruffian force, Was hurried from his lov'd Constantia's arms. Cons. Say, when was this? Hen. When laid in yonder grot Thy sense was lost in sleep. Cons. What foes unknown? Hen. A band of pirates, with barbarian rage, Assail'd him here; awhile his valour stood Against their fury, till his hand receiv'd A luckless wound and dropp'd the sword; then soon, Oppress'd by numbers, he remain'd their prisoner. Cons. But wherefore all this timeâ Hen. 'Till now detain'd In cruel bonds, his thoughts alone were free, And these have never stray'd from his Constantia. Cons. O Heavens! how have I wrong'd thee, my Gernando! Hen. At length behold to liberty restor'd, Gernando comes; behold him all thy own: Again he comes, a tender faithful husband, To give thee back thy peace, to calm thy sorrows, To live and die with thee. Cons. Where art thou then? Where art thou, my Gernando? [going to the left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE XV. Enter Sylvia. Syl. Hold Constantia, In vain thou seek'st for thy Gernando there; For even but now, in tender care for thee, Hastening to yonder stream, a sudden force Assail'd him and prevented his return. [pointing to the right. Cons. Ye powers! Assail'd? By whom and why? Hen. Forgive me: The fault is mine. Gernando thought thee dead, And vow'd to dwell for ever here; and hence I gave command to bear him off by force. Cons. Haste, let us set him free. [going. Syl. Constantia, stay; Already have I told them all the story. Cons. Must I still wait? Have I not waited long, So many years endur'd of tedious sorrow? 'Tis time at length to find a happy period To all my woes. [turning to go, is received into the arms of Gernando, who enters at the instant.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE LAST. Gernando, Constantia, Henriques, Sylvia. Ger. Here, in these faithful arms, Receive the bliss thou seek'st. Cons. And can it be? Ger. Do I not dream? Cons. Do I then hold Gernando? Ger. Do I embrace my wife, my dear Constantia? Hen. These tears, caresses, and imperfect accents Dissolve my soul in tender sympathy. Syl. [goes to Hen.] Tell me, Henriques, wherefore are you thoughtful? Gernando sure is kinder far than you: Mark how with gentle speech he sooths Constantia, While you, in sullen silence seem to stand, Without one word for Sylvia. Hen. Could I hope That I were dear to theeâ Syl. If dear to me? Yes, dearer than my fawn. [joyful and tenderly. Hen. Then give me, fair one, Thy plighted hand and be Henriques' wife. Syl. Your wife! O no, that were indeed a folly: So might I, left on some far-distant isle, Drag on my days in mournful solitude. Cons. No, Sylvia, my Gernando left me not; Thou shalt know all. Men are not, as I said, Faithless and cruel. Syl. When I knew Henriques, I thought not so. Cons. Unjustly I accus'd them, But now, convinc'd, retract my former error. Syl. And I retract whate'er I said before. [gives her hand to Hen. Chorus. When lowering clouds the skies o'er-spread, Let Hope exalt her cheerful head, And all the threats of Fate despise. Fortune shall give her malice o'er, And Constancy's triumphant power At length above her sufferings rise. END OF THE UNINHABITED ISLAND.</field>
