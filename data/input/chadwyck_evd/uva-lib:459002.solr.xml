      <field name="fulltext">CVPID AND DEATH. A MASQUE. As it was Presented before his Excellencie, The Embassadour of Portugal, Upon the 26. of March, 1653.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Printer to the Reader. This Masque was born without ambition of more, than to make good a privat entertainment, though it found, without any address or design of the Author, an honourable acceptation from his Excellency, the Embassadour of Portugal, to whom it was presented by Mr. Luke Channen, &amp;c. It had not so soon been published, for the Author meant all civilities to all persons, but that he heard an imperfect Copy was put to the Press, with an addition before it, of some things, that should be obtruded by another hand, which the Authors judgement could not consent too. The Scæns wanted no elegance, or curiosity for the delight of the Spectator. The Musical compositions had in them a great soul of Harmony. For the Gentlemen that perform'd the Dances, thus much the Author did affirm, upon sight of their practise, that they shew'd themselves Masters of their quality.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene. A Forrest, on the side of a Hill a fair House representing an Inne or Tavern, out of which cometh an Host, being a jolly sprightly old man, his Cap turn'd up with Crimson, his Doublet Fustian, with Jerkin and hanging sleeves, Trunk hose of Russet, Stockings yellow, cross gartered; after him a Chamberlain. Ho. Are all things in their preparation, For my Immortall guests? Ch. Nothing is wanting That doth concern my Province Sir, I am Your Officer above stairs. The great Chamber With the two woodden Monuments to sleep in (That weigh six load of Timber, Sir) are ready. That for the Prince D' Amour, whom we call Cupid, I have trimm'd artificially with Roses, And his own Mother's Mirtle. But I have Committed Sacrilege to please the other, Death do's delight in Ew, and I have rob'd A Church-yard for him. Are you sure they'l come To night? I would fain see this Dwarf call'd Cupid, For t'other, I look on him in my fancy, Like a starv'd goblin. Ho. Death, I must confess, Cuts not so many inches in the Say, As our last Venison, 'tis a thin-chap'd hound, And yet the Cormorant is ever feeding. Ch. He is kin to the devouring Gentleman Of the long robe— Ho. That has bespoke a Chamber I'th' College among the Bears, and means to be In commons with them. Ch. But good sir resolve me, Are they good spirited guests? will they tipple To elevation? do they scatter metall Upon the waiters? Will they rore, and fancie The Drawers, and the Fiddles, till their pockets Are empty as our neighbours drone? and after Drop by degrees their wardrobe? and in the morning, When they have day-light to behold their nakedness, Will they with confidence amaze the streets? And in their shirts to save their pickel'd credits, Pretend a race, and trip it like fell footmen? These rantings were the badges of our Gentry, But all their dancing dayes are done, I fear. Ho. These were the garbs, and motions, late in fashion With humorous mortalls; but these guests are of No humane race. Ch. 'Pray what attendance have they? Ho. Love has two Gentlemen, that wait on him in his Chamber, Of speciall trust, he cannot act without them. Ch. Their Names sir, I beseech you? Ho. Folly and Madness. Ch. A pair of precious instruments, and fit To be o'th' privy counsell. Ho. We may see What most of our Nobility are come to. Ch. Sure they are well descended sir. Ho. The fool Could ride a hundred mile in his own Pedegree, And give as many Coats— Ch. Fools coats, there are Enough to wear them. Ho. As he had Acres in Eleven fat Lordships, And plaid at Duck and Drake with Gold, like Pibbles. Ch. Was this man born a fool? Ho. No, but his keeping Company with Philosophers undid him, Who found him out a Mistris, they call'd Fame, And made him spend half his estate in Libraries, Which he bestowed Colleges, took the toy Of building quadrangles, kept open house, And fell at last most desperatly in love With a poor Dayrie Maid, for which he was begg'd— Ch. A Fool? Ho. And leads the Van in Cupids regiment. Ch. What was the Mad-man sir? Ho. A Thing was born to a very fair per annum, And spent it all in Looking-glasses. Ch. How? That's a project I never heard on, Looking-glasses? How many did he break sir in a day? Ho. They broke him rather, in the right understanding; For Nature having given him a good face, The man grew wilde with his own admirations, And spent his full means upon flatterers. That represented him next to an Angell. Thus blown up, he took confidence to Court A Lady of noble blood, and swelling Fortune; Within three dayes fell sick of the small Pox, And on the fourth run mad, with the conceit His face, when he recover'd, would be like A Country Cake, from which some children had New pick'd the plums. Ch. A brace of pretty beagles. Ho. They are here. Ch. I see not Death. Ho. He's the last thing we look for. Enter Cupid, Folly, Madness, the Host joyns with them in a Dance. SONG. Though little be the God of love, Yet his Arrows mighty are, And his Victories above What the valiant reach by War, Nor are his limits with the skie; O'r the milky way he'l flie, And sometimes wound a Deitie. Apollo once the Python slew, But a keener Arrow flew From Daphne's eye, and made a wound For which the God no Balsome found; One smile of Venus too did more On Mars, than Armies could before; If a warm fit thus pull him down, How will she Ague-shake him with a frown; Thus Love can fiery spirits tame, And when he please cold Rocks inflame. Enter Death, he Danceth the second Entrie, after which, he speaks. De. Holla! within! Enter Chamberlain. Ch. You are welcome Gentlemen; ha? Quarter, oh quarter, I am a friend sir, A moveable belonging to this Tenement Where you are expected, Cupid is come already, And supp'd, and almost drunk; we ha' reserv'd According to order, for your palate, sir, The Cokatrices Eggs, the cold Toad-Pie, Ten dozen of Spiders, and the Adders tongues Your servant Famine, sir, bespoke. De. Live, live. Exit. Ch. I thank you sir; a curse upon his physnomy; How was I surpriz'd? 'twas high time to comfort me, I felt my life was melting downward. Death, oh death! Within. Ch. Who's that? I do not like the voice. What art? Enter Despair with a Halter. Des. A miserable thing. Ch. I, so thou seem'st; Hast not a name? Des. My name, sir, is Despair. Ch. Despair, my time's not come yet, what have I To do with thee? what com'st thou hither for? Des. To find out Death; Life is a burden to me; I have pursu'd all Paths to find him out, And here i'th' Forrest had a glimpse on him, But could not reach him with my feet, or voice; I would fain dy, but Death flies from me, sir. Ch. I wonder you should travell in the Forrest, And among so many Trees find none convenient, Having the tackling ready, 'bout your neck too. Some great affairs take up the Devils time, He cannot sure attend these low employments, Hee's busie 'bout Leviathans. I know not, There's somthing in't; you have not made your Will sure. Des. Yes, sir, I carry it wo'me, it wants nothing But his name, and my subscription. Ch. VVhose name? Des. His name I mean to make my Heir. Ch. VVho's that? Des. That charitable man VVill bring Death to me, there's a blank left for him, And if you please to do me, sir, the office, Even you shall be the man; I have profest An Usurer these fifty years, and upwards; The VVidows and sad Orphans, whose estates I have devoured, are croking in my conscience. Ch. And shall he be your Heir, that does this feat, To make you acquainted with this Canniball You talk of? Des. Oh my happiness! Ch. I'll do it. But I believe you're sorry for your baseness, Your rapines and Extortion— Des. Mistake not, I am sorry for no mischief I have done, That would come neer repentance, which you know Cures all the akings of the Soul: If I Could but be sorry, Death were of no use to me. Ch. Keep ye of that mind, you say very right sir, I'll try what I can do With Death; to do your conscience a courtesie, He's now within our house; I'll bring you Pen And Ink to write my name too, honest father. Des. Thou art my dearest child, take all my blessings. Ch. Here's like to be a fortune. Exit. Des. I want strength To clime, I see a very pretty twig else, He climes. And space for a most comfortable swing, 'Tis a hard case, the Devill wo'not help At a dead lift. He falls. O my Sciatica! I have broke my Spectacles, and both my Hips Are out of joynt; help— Enter Chamberlain with a Bottle of Wine. Ch. Death will be with you presently, the last course Is now on the Table; that you may not think The time long, I have brought you—ha? rise up sir. Des. Alas, I have had a fall, I was endevouring To do the meritorious work, and hang My self, for Death me thought was long a comming, But my foot slipt. Ch. Alas, what pitty 'twas? If I had thought your soul had been in such Hast, I would have given you a lift before I went. Des. It was my zeal. Ch. Alas it seem'd so; You might have took the River with more ease, The stream would have convey'd you down so gently, You should not feel which way your soul was going. But against the frights, Death might bring with him, I have brought you a Bottle of Wine. I'll begin, sir. He drinks. Des. Would it were Poyson. Ch. So would not I, I thank you, 'Tis pure blood of the Grape. Des. Wine? Ch. At my charge, I know you do not use To pay for Nectar, I bestow it sir. Des. That's kindly said, I care not if I tast— Ch. I'th' mean time please you, I'll peruse the Will, I can put in my own name, and make it fit For your subscription—what's here?— Reads. Ha? a thousand pound in Jewells—in ready money Ten thousand more—Land—ha' preserve my senses! I'll write my name, and thank heaven afterwards. —Here sir, before you can subscribe, the Gentleman VVill come, and kill you to your hearts content. Des. Hum! this foolish Wine has warm'd me, what d'ee Call the name on't? Ch. Sack. Des. Sack, why truly son— Ch. Nay sir make hast, for Death will be here instantly. Des. At his own leisure, I would not be troublesome; Now I do know his lodging, I can come Another time. Ch. But the Will Father, you may write now— Des. Deeds are not vigorous without legall witnesses; My Scrivener lives at the next Town, and I Do find my body in a disposition To walk a mile or two. Sack d'ee call it? How strangely it does alter my opinion? Ch. Why? have you no mind to hang your self? Des. I thank you, I find no inclination. Ch. Sha'not I be your Heir then? Des. In the humour, And spirit, I now feel in brain, and body, I may live—to see you hang'd; I thank you heartily. Ch. But you will have the conscience, I hope, To pay me for the Wine, has wrought this miracle. Des. Your free gift I remember, you know, I use not To pay for Nectar, as you call it. Yet I am not without purpose to be gratefull, Some things shall be corrected in my Will, In the mean time, if you'l accept of a Gives him the Halter. Small Legacy, this hemp is at your service, And it shall cost you nothing, I bestow it. We men of money, worn with age, and cares, Drink in new life, from Wine, that costs us nothing. Farewell, and learn this lesson from Despair, Give not your Father Sack to be his Heir. Ch. Not a tear left? would's brains were in the bottle. Exit. SONG. Victorious men of Earth, no more Proclame how wide your Empires are; Though you binde in every shore, And your triumphs reach as far as night or day, Tet you proud Monarks must obey, And mingle with forgotten ashes, when Death calls yee to the croud of common men. Devouring Famine, Plague, and War, Each able to undo man-kind, Deaths servile Emissaries are, Nor to these alone confin'd, He hath at will More quaint and subtle wayes to kill. A smile or kiss, as he will use the art, Shall have the cunning skill to break a heart. Enter Chamberlain. Ch. Ho Master, master! Enter Host. Ho. What's the matter? Ch. Nothing but to ask you, whether you be Alive or no, or whether I am not My own ghost, that thus walk, and haunt your house. Ho. Thou lookest frighted. Ch. Death and his train, are gone, I thank Heaven he's departed; I slept not One wink to night, nor durst I pray aloud, For fear of waking Death; but he at midnight Calls for a Cup to quench his thirst, a bowl Of blood I gave him for a mornings draught, And had an Ague all the while he drunk it. At parting, in my own defence, and hope To please him, I desir'd to kiss his hand, Which was so cold, o'th' sudden, sir, my mouth Was frozen up, which as the case stood Then with my teeth, did me a benefit, And kept the dancing bones from leaping out. At length, fearing for ever to be speechless, I us'd the strength of both my hands to open My lips, and now feel'd every word I spake Drop from it like an Icycle. Ho. This cold Fit will be over; what said Cupid? Ch. He VVas fast asleep, Ho. The Boy went drunk to bed, Death did not wake him? Ch. It was not necessary in point of reckoning, Death was as free as any Emperour, And payes all where he comes, Death quits all scores. I have the summa totalis in my pocket. But he without more ceremony left The house at morning twilight. Ho. Ha? they knock— Get thee a cup of VVine to warm thy intralls. Exit Chamb. Though Love himself be but a water-drinker, His train allow themselves rich Wines. Your Fool And Madman is your onely guests to Taverns, And to Excesse; this licence time affords, VVhen Masters pay, their servants drink like lords. Enter Chamb. Ch. Sir, they call for you, Cupid's up, and ready, And looks as fresh, as if he had known no surfeit Of Virgins tears, for whose fair satisfaction, He broke his Leaden shafts, and vows hereafter To shoot all flames of love into their servants. There are some Musick come, to give his godship Good morrow, so he means to hear one Song, And then he takes his progress. Ho. I attend him. Exit. Ch. But I have made my own revenge upon him, For the hard-hearted baggage that he sent me; And Death I have serv'd a trick for all his huffing. They think not what Artillery they carry Along with them, I have chang'd their Arrows. How Death will fret to see his fury cozen'd? But how will Love look pale, when he shall find VVhat a Mortality his Arrows make Among the Lovers? let the God look too't, I have put it past my care, and not expect To see them agen, or should I meet with Death, I shall not fear him now; for Cupid, if Lovers must onely by his Arrows fall, I am safe, for ladies I defie you all. SONG. Stay Cupid, whither art thou flying, Pitty the pale Lovers dying, They that honour'd thee before, Will no more At thy Altar pay their Vows. O let the weeping Virgins strow, In stead of Rose, and Myrtle boughs, Sad Ew, and funerall Cypress now. Unkind Cupid leave thy killing, These are all thy Mothers Doves, Oh do not wound such noble Loves, And make them bleed, that should be billing. The Scene is chang'd into a pleasant Garden, a Fountain in the midst of it, Walks and Arbours, delightfully exprest, in divers places Ladies lamenting over their Lovers slain by Cupid, who is discover'd flying in the air. Enter a Lover playing upon a Lute, courting his Mistris; they dance. Enter Nature in a white Robe, a Chaplet of Flowers, a green Mantle fringed with Gold, her Hair loose, they start, and seem troubled at her entrance. Na. Flie, fly my Children, love that should preserve, And warm your hearts, with kind, and active blood, Is now become your enemy, a murderer. This Garden that was once your entertainment With all the beauty of the Spring, is now By some strange curse upon the Shafts of Cupid, Design'd to be a Grave; look every where The noble Lovers on the ground ly bleeding, By frantick Cupid slain; into whose wounds, Distracted Virgins pour their tears so fast, That having dreind their fountains, they present Their own pale monuments; while I but relate This story, see, more added to the dead. Oh flie and save your selves, I am your Parent Nature, that thus advise you to your safeties. Enter Cupid, he strikes the Lover. He's come already. Lover. Ha? what Winter creeps Into my heart? Na. He faints, 'tis now too late, Some kinder God call back the winged Boy, And give him eyes to look upon his murders. Nature grows stiff with horrour of this spectacle; If it be Death to love, what will it be When Death it self must act his Cruelty? Enter Death. And here he comes, what Tragedies are next? Enter old Men and Women with Crutches. Na. Two aged pair, these will be fit for Death, They can expect but a few minutes more To wear the heavy burden of their lives, Death strikes them with his Arrow, they admiring one another, let fall their Crutches, and embrace. Exit D. Na. Astonishment to Nature, they throw off All their infirmities, as young men do Their aery upper garments. These were the Effects of Cupids Shafts; prodigious Change! I have not patience to behold 'em longer. Exit. They Dance, with Antique postures, expressing Rurall Courtship. SONG. What will it Death advance thy name Upon cold Rocks to wast a flame, Or by mistake to throw Bright Torches into pits of Snow? Thy rage is lost, And thy old killing Frost; With thy Arrows thou maist trie To make the young or aged bleed, But indeed Not compell one heart to die. CHORUS. O Love! oh Death! be it your fate Before you both repent too late to meet and trie Upon your selves, your sad artillerie. So Death may make Love kind again, Or Cruell Death by Love be slain. Enter six Gentlemen armed as in the field to fight three against three; To them Death, he strikes them with his Arrow, aud they preparing to charge, meet one another, and embrace. They Dance. SONG. Change, oh change your fatall bows, Since neither knows The vertue of each others Darts; Alas, what will become of hearts If it prove A Death to Love, We shall find Death will be cruell to be kind: For when he shall to Armies flie, Where men think blood too cheap to buy Themselves a name, He reconciles them, and deprives The valiant men of more than lives, A Victory, and Fame. Whilst Love deceiv'd by these cold shafts, in steed Of curing wounded hearts, must kill indeed. CHORUS. Take pitty Gods, some ease the world will find, To give young Cupid eyes, or strike Death blind. Death should not then have his own will And Love, by seeing men bleed, leave off to kill. Enter Chamberlain leading two Apes. Ch. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, All you that delight to be merry, come see My brace of Court Apes, for a need we be three; I have left my old trade of up and down staires, And now live by leading my Apes unto Faires. Will you have any sport? draw your mony, be quick sir, And then come aloft Jack, they shall shew you a trick, sir. Now am I in my naturall Condition, For I was born under a wandring Planet; I durst no longer stay with my old Master, For fear Cupid and Death be reconcil'd To their own Arrows, and so renew with me Some pretious acquaintance. Enter Death, he striks the Chamb. Ch. Oh, my heart, 'Twas Death I fear, I am paid then with a vengeance; My dear Apes do not leave me, ha? come neer— What goodly shapes they have, what lovely faces! Yee Twins of beauty, where were all those graces Obscur'd so long? what Cloud did interpose I could not see before this Lip, this Nose? These Eyes? that do invite all hearts to wo them, Brighter than Stars; Ladies are nothing to them. Oh let me here pay down a Lovers duty; Who is so mad to dote on Womans Beauty? Nature doth here her own complexion spread, No borrow'd Ornaments of white and red; These cheeks wear no adulterate mixtures on them, To make them blush as some do, fie upon them! Look what fair Cheries on their Lips do grow? Black Cherries, such as none of you can shew, That boast your beauties, let me kiss your a? Enter a Satyr, that strikes on the him shoulder, and takes away his Apes. What's that? a shot i'th' shoulder too? ha. What will become of me now? oh my Apes! The Darlings of my heart are ravish'd from me. He beckons, and courts them back with passionat postures. No? not yet? nor yet hard-hearted Apes. I must despair for ever to enjoy them. Despair? that name puts me in mind, He looks in his pocket, and pulls out the Halter. 'Tis here; Welcome dear Legacy, I see he was A Prophet that bestowed it; how it fits me? As well as if the Hangman had took measure. 'Tis honour in some men to fight, and dy In their fair Ladies quarrell, and shall I Be 'fraid to hang my self in such a cause? Farewell my pretty Apes, when Hemp is ti'd Drop tears apace, and I am satisfi'd. Exit. A Dance of the Satyre and Apes. Upon the sudden a solemn Musick is heard, and Mercury seen descending upon a Cloud, at whose approach, the other creep in amazed. In a part of the Scene within a Bower, Nature discover'd sleeping. Mer. Hence ye prophane, and take your dwellings up Within some Cave, that never saw the Sun, Whose beams grow pale, and sick to look upon you; This place be sacred to more noble objects. And see where Nature tir'd with her Complaints To heaven for Death and Cupid's Tyranny Upon a bank of smiling Flow'rs lies sleeping. Cares, that devour the peace of other bosomes, Have by an overcharge of sorrow wrought Her heart into a calm, where every sense Is bound up in a soft repose, and silence; Be her Dreams all of me. But to my Embassie. Cupid, wheresoe'r thou be, The Gods lay their commands on thee, In pain of being banish'd to The unfrequented shades below At my first summons to appear. Cupid, Cupid. Enter Cupid. Cap. I am here, What send the Gods by Mercury? Mer. Thy shame and horrour. I remove This mist. He unblinds him. Now see in every Grove What slaughter thou hast made, all these Fond Cupid were thy Votaries, Does not their blood make thine look pale? All slain by thee; 'two'not prevail To urge mistakes, thy fact appears; Jove, and the Gods have bow'd their ears To groning Nature, and sent me From their high Christall Thrones to see What blood, like a dire Vapour rise', Doth spread his Wings to blind the eyes Of Heaven and Day; and to declare Their Iustice and Immortall care Over the lower World, but stay Another must his fate obey. Death heretofore, the look'd-for close To tedious life, the long repose To wearied Nature, and the gate That leads to Mans eternall fate, I in the name of every God, Command thee from thy dark aboad, As thou wilt fly their wrath appear, At my first Summon— Enter Death. De. I am here Mer. Nature awake, and with thy sleep Shake of the heavy Chains that keep Thy Soul a captive. Nat. Mercury? Or am I still in Dreams? Mer. Thy Eye Take truce with tears, see much abus'd Nature, whom thou hast long accus'd, Leave thy wonder, and attend What the Gods by Hermes send. But first I charge you to resign Your fatall Shafts. Cup. I, these are mine. They change. Mer. Cupid, the Gods do banish thee From every Palace, thou must be Confin'd to Cottages, to poor And humble Cells, Love must no more Appear in Princes Courts, their heart Impenetrable by thy Dart, And from softer influence free By their own wills must guided be. Cup. I shall obey. Mer. Death, thou maist still Exercise thy power to kill, With this limit, that thy rage Presume not henceforth to engage On Persons, in whose brest, divine Marks of art, or honour shine; Upon these, if thy malice trie, They may bleed, but never die; These are not to be overcome, Above the force of Age or Tomb. Is Nature pleas'd? Na. The Gods are just. Mer. To this you both submit? C.D. We must. Mer. Ye are dismist. Exeunt. Nat. But Mercury, What satisfaction shall I have For noble Children in the Grave By Cupid slain? Mer. They cannot be Reduc'd to live again with thee, And could thy fancy entertain In what blest seats they now remain, Thou wouldst not wish them here. Na. Might I With some knowledge bless my eye, Nature would put on Youth. Mer. Then see Their blest condition. The Scene is changed into Elizium, where the grand Masquers, the slain Lovers appear in glorious Seats, and Habits. Na. Where am I? The World no such Perfection yields. Mer. These are the fair Elizian fields. SONG. Open blest Elizium Grove, Where an eternall Spring of Love Keeps each Beauty fair, these shades No chill Dew or Frost invades; Look how the Flowers, and every Tree Pregnant with Ambrosia be; Neer banks of Violet Springs appear, Weeping out Nectar every tear; While the once-harmonious Spheares, (turn'd all to ears) Now listen to the Birds, whose Quire Sing every charming Accent higher. CHORUS. If this place be not Heaven, one thought can make it, And Gods by their own wonder lead, mistake it. Na. Oh, who shall guide me hence? old Natures sight Grows feeble at the brightness of this glory. Mer. I will be Natures conduct. Na. Mercury—be ever honour'd. Exeunt. The Grand Dance. Enter Mercury. Mer. Return, return you happy men, To your own blessed Shades agen, Lest staying long, some new desire In your calm bosomes raise a fire; Here are some Eyes, whose every beam May your wandring hearts inflame, And make you forfeit your cool Groves, By being false to your first Loves. Like a Perfuming gale o'r Flowers, Now glide again to your own Bowers. The Masquers retreated, the Curtain falls. FINIS.</field>
