      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. My pattern I've a mind to make The Achilles Of AristarchusâFrom that Tragedy I'll take my opening to this Comedy. Hist then!âBe silent, and attendâOur chief, The manager, would have you all to hear; And in your places with good humour sit, Whether or full, or fasting ye are come. Those who have din'd, I look upon as wisest: Such as have not, may dine upon the Play. In him, who has his dinner, by our favour, Thus ready cook'd before him; it were foolish, To sit here fasting, with an empty stomach. Ho!âCryer there!âStand up, proclaim attention, I wait to see whether you know your duty. Come, exercise your lungs; by which you eat, Get clothes and living.âFor unless you cry Out lustily, unheard you'll starve in silence. Well, to have double wages, now sit down. Heaven grant success!âNow my commands obeyâ Let no stale mistress sit upon the stageâ Let not the Lictors, or his rods be noisy; Nor while the actor's still upon the stage, Shew any to their seats: those who have ta'en Too long a nap at home, 'tis fit should stand; And be content, nor think of sleeping here. Let the slaves stand, that freemen may sit down, Or pay for seats, if they have wherewithal. Or else march home, and 'scape a double evil; Here to be beat with rods, at home with thongs, If things be not in order, when their masters Come back again. Let nurses keep their bantlings At home, nor hither think of bringing them, Lest they should die with thirst, their brats with hunger; Or, when they want the teat, should baa like kids For milk. Let matrons silent see the piece, And smile in silence too; nor with their voices, Loud as they're shrill, come to this place to babble. Home is the place to hold their prittle-prattle; Nor teaze their husbands here, and at home too. And now to you, the umpires of our Piece, Be ye impartial; give to no comedian The palm of honour, but as merit claims. For private pique, or interest none exclude; Lest to good actors you prefer the bad. This one thing more, I had almost forgotâ Rush, while we're acting, to the cake-house, lacqueys, Now is your time, run, while the rolls are hot. These are the manager's commandsâBy Hercules! All would have good success, if for himself Each one would put remember these his ordersâ Now to the story of the Comedyâ That you may be as wise as I myself, Its scite, its bounds, abutments I'll lay down; For you must know that I am made surveyorâ But first of all, if you so please, I'll give you The name of this our PieceâIf you don't please, I'll tell it ne'erthelessâFor I've authority From those who manageâThis same Play in Greek Is call'd The Carthaginian; but in Latin 'Tis term'd by Plautus, The Pulse-eating Uncle. You have the name; and now shall know the rest. 'Tis here our story will be criticiz'd; On its own stage its judgement 'twill receive. You are the criticks; exercise your office. There were two brothers, Carthaginians both, Both opulent, and of a noble family: One yet is living, but the other's dead. And this with greater confidence I say, Because the embalmer, who embalm'd him told me. The brother who is dead, had but one son. This only son, when seven years old was stolen From Carthage, and secreted from his fatherâ Six years indeed before the old man's death.â He, seeing he had lost his only son, Fell sick with grief, making his brother heir; Then, without taking leave, set out for Acheron. The kidnapper brought off the child to Calydon; Here sold him to a rich old man, desirous Of having children, but averse to marriage. This old man bought him, without knowing him To be the son of his old host at Carthage, Adopted him, and made him when he died His heirâThe young man lives there in that houseâ To Carthage shall I now return againâ Have you, good folks, any commands at Carthage? If so, pay down the ready, or you trifleâ But if you pay it, you will trifle moreâ This old man's uncle, old, and living still At Carthage, had two daughtersâFive years old Was one, the other four: when with their nurse Together they were lost: and from Megara, By stealth, convey'd away to Anactorium. There the kidnapper sold for ready money Both nurse and children, to a man, (if pandars Are men) the most accursed upon earthâ Yourselves may farther guess what kind of man He is, whose name is LycusâFrom that town, From Anactorium, where he liv'd before, He, on account of gain, remov'd but lately Hither to ChalydonâIn that house he lives. By that young man here, ignorant who she is, And little thinking she's his own relation. Yet he has ne'er enjoy'd her; he's so harrass'd By that vile pandar, and so tantaliz'dâ As yet he has neither privately debauch'd her, Nor brought her home in publick, as his own. The rascal would not part with her: but seeing How the youth lov'd her, rais'd his price the higher. The younger sister is a captain's flame, Who fain would purchase her to be his mistress. The Carthaginian, having lost his daughters, Seeks them by sea and land; and at each town Finds out the courtezans, where'er they live: Gives gold, prolongs the night in his enquiries, Whence, of what family, of what estate, Servile, or free; taken in war, or stolen. So wisely of his daughters he pursues The search; so subtlely too. All languages He knows; but hides his knowledge, he's so true A Carthaginian. 'Twas but yesten eve, In short, he landed at this port. The father Of these two girls is uncle to the youth. D'ye take it? If you do, then draw it out: Break it not short; but let the Play go onâ [going. Hold! I'd almost forgot to tell the rest. He who adopted this young man, was guest, And well received by the Carthaginian, Who will this day be here, and find his daughters; With this his brother's sonâas I've been told. Well, I go in and dress. And you with coolness, Remember thisâHe who to-day arrives here, Will find his daughters and his brother's son. Then fare ye wellâAttendâI'll go, e'er long To appear another man. For what remains, Some remain here, who will explain it to youâ FarewellâNow favour us.âAnd so the goddess Salvation be propitious to you all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter AGORASTOCLES and MILPHIO. AGORASTOCLES. Milphio, to you I often have intrusted Matters of doubt, which wanted much advice; They by your wisdom, labour, kindness, care, And art, have all succeeded to my wish; For which good deeds, I own I owe to you Your liberty, and many thanks to boot. Mil. Old sayings, timely introduc'd, are clever, Pye-crust and promises are made, 'tis said But to be broken: now you wheedle me; Your promises are sieves; they won't hold water; Meer words of course; meer castles in the air. But yesterday you wore out three bull thongs Upon my hideâ Ago. I am in love; and what Through love I did, you should forgive, my Milphio. Mil. Nothing more just.âWhy, now I am in love O'er head and ears; let me give you a drubbing, As you did me, and for no fault at all. You should, you know, forgive a man in love. Ago. Why, if you long, and it will give you pleasure, I give consent; bind, tye me up and scourge me. You've my permissionâ Mil. Ay, but when you're loos'd, If that permission you should then revoke, I shall be hang'd. Ago. And dare I serve you so? Whene'er I see you scourg'd, each stroke gives pain. Mil. I'm sure I feel that pain. Ago. And so do I. Mil. I would you felt it all. But what's your pleasure? Ago. Why should I lye? I love immoderately. Mil. Yes, yes, my back is sensible of that. Ago. I tell you, I'm in love with Adelphasium, Our neighbour here, this pandar's eldest girl. Mil. You told me that before. Aga. I'm on the rack With my desireâBut Lycus, that vile pandar, Her masterâDirt itself is not more dirtyâ Mil. Would you present him with some mischief now? Ago. With all my heart. Mil. Present him then with me. Ago. Go, hang yourself. Mil. But tell me now in earnest: Say, would you wish to be a plague to him? Ago. I would. Mil. Send but this self-same me, I'll see, He shall have plague and mischief too. Ago. You joke! Mil. Wish you, without all loss or charge of yours, To see your mistress free? Ago. I wish it, Milphio. Mil. I'll see it done. Three hundred PhilippÃ¦ans, Gold ones, you have within. Ago. Six hundred too. Mil. Three hundred are enoughâ Ago. Well then, and what Will you do with them?â Mil. Peace! The pandar whole, And with him, his whole family, I mean This day to you a presentâ Ago. By what way? Mil. I'll let you knowâYour bailiff Collybiscus Is now in town: this pandar knows him not. D'you understand? Ago. I understand your wordsâ But I'm quite ignorant of what you drive at. Mil. Ignorant? Ago. Troth, I amâ Mil. Then I'll inform you. Give him the gold to carry to the pandar: And with it, let him say, that he's a stranger Come from some other town, with a desire To gratify an amorous inclination; And wants some private place, where he may freely Indulge his appetite. Greedy of the money, The avaricious rogue will take him in; And man and gold conceal. Ago. I like the plot. Mil. You'll ask him, if your slave is in the house: Me, he'll suppose you mean; and answer, no. No doubt then, but he'll be adjudg'd a thief; And fin'd to pay of both the double value, The slave and money.âHe can't raise the sum: Him then, and his whole family to you The PrÃ¦tor will decree in open court; And thus our wolfish pandar's in a pit. Ago. I like the scheme. Mil. You'll like it more, when more I've polish'd itâAt present 'tis but rough. Ago. Unless you want me, Milphio, I am going To Venus' temple; 'tis her feast to-day. Mil. I know it is. Ago. To see the courtezans; And feast my eyes with harlot-finery. Mil. No, first begin the action of our plot. Let's in, and well instruct your Collybiscus How to behave, and carry on the cheatâ Ago. Tho' love's my master, you I will obey. Mil. And I'll take care you shan't repent the deed. [Exit Agorastocles. There is in this man's heart a spot of love, Which by no means can e'er be wash'd out clean, Without much loss to somebodyâAnd Lycus, That wicked pandar here's a proper person. At him the bolt of mischief is well aim'd, And soon I'll draw the string. See, Adelphasium, And Anterastilis are coming hither. The foremost's she has turn'd my master's brain. I'll call himâAgorastocles! Holla! If you would see the sweetest games, come forth. Re-enter AGORASTOCLES. Ago. What is this bustle, Milphio? Mil. 'Tis your mistress, If you would see her. Ago. May the gods reward you, Who offer to my view this charming sight! SCENE II. Enter ADELPHASIUM, ANTERASTILIS, and an ATTENDANT. Adel. The man that wants employment in abundance, Let him procure a woman and a ship; For no two things can furnish you more business; Especially when you begin to rig them. These are two things are never rig'd enough; Nor is there any end of't, they so love it. And this I speak from very late experience; For we from dawn, from peep of day, till now, Have never given intermission to Our washing, rubbing, wiping, smoothing, dressing, Polishing, painting, forming of our features; And yet we had two handmaids to assist us, Washing and cleaningâWe quite tir'd two men With bringing waterâFie upon't! What plague One single female gives: but two I know, Can for a nation find full work enough; Who night and day, thro' every stage of life For ever wash, and wipe and dress, and deck. In short, the golden mean's no rule for us: We know no end of washing and of rubbing. And she who only is wash'd clean, and not Thoroughly dress'd, passes, I think, for dirtyâ Ant. I am amaz'd to hear you talk so, sister: You, who're so witty, circumspect and wise: For when with nicest art we've trick'd ourselves, Do all we can, we scarce can find us lovers. Adel. Why that is trueâBut ever think on this. In every thing, the golden mean is best. Excess in its own nature, is a plague; A manifest vexation to mankindâ Ant. The men (I prithee, sister, think on this) Deem us, like salt-fish, without taste or sweetness; Unless well soak'd in water, they are so rank, So salt, one cannot touch 'em. Such are we, Tasteless, and graceless without cost and dress. Mil. In my opinion, Agorastocles, [apart.] This girl here is an arrant cookâShe knows To freshen salt-fishâ Ago. Don't be troublesome. Adel. Peace, sister, pray: let others talk so of us; And let us not ourselves proclaim our foiblesâ Ant. Well, I have doneâ Adel. I love you for'tâBut answer; Are all things ready here, to make the gods Propitious to us?â Ant. I've taken care of all. Ago. How fine a day! how charming, how delightful, Worthy of Venus' self, whose feast it is! Mil. Nothing for me, who call'd you to this sight?â [apart to Ago.] Don't I deserve a cask of good old wine? Come, say you give it me: Ha! not a word? He has lost his tongue, I think: Why, what the deuce! You stand astonish'd. Agor. Suffer me to love: And don't disturb meâPrithee hold your tongue. Mil. I'm dumb. Agor. Had you been so, you'd ne'er have said so. Ant. Come sister, let's be going.â Adel. Ha! my dear! Why that way are you hurrying? Ant. Do you ask? Our master's waiting us at Venus' temple. Adel. Why, let him waitâThe altar's crouded now. You would not sure, squeeze in 'mongst bakers strumpets, Old worn out punks, wretches with train oyl greas'd; Low dirty slaves that stink of their own filth, Whom ne'er a freeman would take home, nor touch, The penny drabs of little dirty slaves. Mil. Be hang'dâAnd dare you too to spurn at us? A punk!âAs if she was a beauty!âAs if Herself was fit for princes!âO prodigious!â A pigmy thus to throw out words so big!â A wench, for whom I would not give a straw!â Ago. O ye immortals!âGods omnipotent! What greater beauty is with you above? What have you there, that I should ever think You more immortal than myself, whose eyes Are ravish'd with such exquisite delight. Venus above is Venus now no longer. To this true Venus will I pray henceforward With eyes of love, propitious to regard me. Milphio! where are you? Mil. Present to your asking. Ago. A pretty present! Mil. You are merry, Sir. Ago. I learn this from youâ Mil. From me do you learn To love the girl whom you have never touch'd? That's nothing new to youâ Ago. I love the gods, And fear 'em, yet restrain th'unhallow'd touch. Ant. By Castor! when I look on our attire, We're dress'd so ill, it grieves me. Adel. Well enough! Dress'd for our master's gain, and our own tooâ Where the expence exceeds, there are no gains. In dress; enough is better than too much. Ago. Now may the gods so love me, Milphio, as I'd rather she should love me, than the gods. This woman would constrain a flint to love her. Mil. You've hit the mark; for you, who love her so, Are senseless as a flint. Ago. But witness for me, I never yet have soil'd her lips with kisses. Mil. I'll hie me therefore to a pool or lake, And get some soil. Ago. Some soil? And what to do? Mil. I'll tell you whatâTo soil her lips and yours. Ago. Go to the gallows! Mil. I'm next that already. Ago. Do you persist? Mil. I'm hush. Ago. Be ever so. Mil. At my own game you challenge me, and yet Make game of me yourself. Ant. Now you may think Yourself well dress'd, good sister; but you'll sigh, When others, on comparison, are finer. Adel. I find no envy, sister, in my frame, And a good disposition far prefer To gold: for gold's the gift of fortune: goodness Of disposition, is the gift of nature. Rather than wealth, may I be bless'd with virtue. O, modesty becomes us more than scarlet; And is a brighter ornament than gold. Bad manners soil the finest dress, e'en worse Than dirt; but virtuous ones, do by their deeds, Brighten the foulest. Ago. Milphio! do you hear? Wilt play a merry prank? Mil. With all my heart. Ago. Take my adviceâ Mil. I willâ Ago. Go home and hang Yourself. Mil. And why? Ago. For that again, on earth, Such honey dropping words you will not hear. Why should you live?âTake my advice, and swing. Mil. If you'll swing by me, like a bunch of grapes. Ago. But I have reason good to liveâI love My Adelphasiumâ Mil. I to eat and drink.â Adel. [to Ant.] Sisterâ Ant. What say you? What is your desire? Adel. Don't you observe my eyes, before not clear, Are brilliant now? Ant. But here is something still, I'th'middle of your eye. Adel. Lend me your hand. Ago. And do you rub those eyes with unwash'd hands? Ant. We've been too indolent to-dayâ Adel. And why? Ant. For that we did not come before 'twas light To Venus' temple; and prefer our fire First on her altar. Adel. Ah! no need of that. It is for night-dark faces to seek night For sacrifice. Before the goddess wakes They speed their work; for were her eyes but open, So ugly they, by Castor! they would fright Venus, and drive her out from her own templeâ Ago. Milphio! Mil. Poor Milphio is a wretch indeed. Well, what with Milphio now?â Ago. Mark, I beseech youâ Her mouth drops honey. Mil. Nothing but tile cakes, Indian corn, wheat, poppy and parch'd nuts. Ago. Think you I am in love? Mil. Yes, with your loss. And that's what Mercury by no means loves. Ago. In love's trade sure we should not deal for gain! Ant. Come, sister, let's be going. Adel. As you please. Follow me this way then. Ant. I follow you. Ago. They're moving. Shall we join 'emâ Mil. Join 'em you. Ago. First, to the elder health, to you the next, [coming up to them.] Second in value, health; and health beside [to the attendant.] To you the third, whose value I don't count. Attend. Then have I lost my labour and my pains. Ago. Whither away? Adel. What I?âto Venus' temple. Ago. Why there? Adel. In order to appease the goddess. Ago. What! is she angry? Sure, it cannot be But she's propitious; I will answer for her. Adel. What are you doing? Why do you teaze me thus? Ago. So cruel?âAh! Adel. Forbear, I beg of you. Ago. Why in such haste?âThe temple's crouded now. Adel. I know it is.âI would be seen and see. Ago. And take you pleasure to behold such frights, Or to expose your beauties to their gaze? Adel. At Venus' temple it is Venus' fair; There merchants meet, and I would shew myself. Ago. To goods unsaleable, the purchaser Must be entic'd by art; but your choice wares In corners tho' they lye, soon find a buyer. But what is your intention?âAt my home When shall we lay our heads and sides together? Adel. That day when Pluto sends away the dead. Ago. I've got some money burning in my pocket. Adel. Give it to me, I soon will cool its heat. Mil. Smart that! in troth! Ago. Go, rascal, to the gallows! Mil. The more I look, the more she seems a bauble; A topping of false hair. Ago. Prate to yourself. You're tiresomeâCome, lift up this veil of yours. [to Adelphasium.] Adel. I'm purified in order to attend The sacrificeâNay, nay, hands off, I say. Ago. SoâsoâWhat now is to be done? Mil. What done? Why, if you're wise, this matter end at once. Ago. What business is't of yours to intermeddle In my affairs?âSay, Milphio, what art doing? Mil. [aside.] This love's my plague!âWhat your commands with me? Ago. What think you is the reason she's so angry? Mil. Why she's so angry?âWhat care's that of mine? That's your affair. Ago. 'Tis over with you, rascal, Unless you make her calm as is the sea, When there the halcyon feeds her young. Mil. Well, say What must I do?â Ago. Fawn, sooth, intreat. Mil. I will, And that most heartilyâBut your ambassador, Good now, don't give him, Sir, a dressing for it. Ago. Well, well, I'll not. Adel. Come, let us now be goingâ Still do you stop me? 'Tis ill done of youâ [to Agorastocles. Many fair promises you've made me, Sir, And all in vainâYou've sworn, not only once, But sworn an hundred times to make me free. While I on you depended thus, nor sought For other aid, the aid you promis'd me Appears not; and I still remain a slave. Sister, pass onâNay, leave meâ [to Agorast. Ago. Then I am ruin'd. Ho! Milphio, what are you about? Mil. My joy, My life, my dear, my pleasure, my delight, [to Adelphasium. My pigsney, my dear little lip, my health, My heart, my honey, sweet as mother's milk, Soft as cream-cheeseâ Ago. Shall I, before my face Let him address her thus?âMay I be tortur'd, If I don't order he be whirl'd to th'hangman I'th'racer's carâ Mil. Nay, Madam, don't, I beg you, On my account be angry with my master. Adel. By your good leave, I will. Mil. You're far too hasty. He'll give much money for youâHe will make you A citizen of Athens, a free womanâ Adel. Why don't you let us goâWhat would you say? To those who wish us well, we wish the same. Mil. If heretofore he has deceiv'd youânow You may in truth, rely upon his word. Adel. Begone, thou would'st trepan meâ Mil. I obey. On this condition tho': let me entreat you, Let me but touch your ear, but kiss your hand: I must, or make you kind, or make him weep. He'll beat me too, I'm wofully afraid, Unless I can prevailâAy, that he will. I know the crabbed manners of the man. My sweetest creature, I beseech you then Suffer yourself to be prevail'd upon. Ago. If I don't strait tear out that scoundrel's eyes, Thrust his teeth down his throat, I'm not a man Of three penceâThere, take that, and this, you rascal. [beats him. This, for your honey, your delight, your heart; This, for your health, your little lip, your darling. Mil. O impious! do you beat thus your ambassador? Ago. And more than thisâI'll add to it, your pigsney, Your little lip, your tongue. Mil. What, ne'er have done? Ago. Is this the way I bad you plead my cause? Mil. How should I then have pleaded? Ago. Do you ask? Why, rascal! thusâYou, this my master's joy, I do beseech his little lip, his heart, His darling, honey, and his mother's milk, His tongue, his sweet cream cheese, yes, you whipt scoundrel, His darling, you scourg'd rascal, his delight, His heart. Whate'er you mention'd as your own, You should have spoke as mine. Mil. Well, be it so. I then intreat of you, my master's joy, And my aversionâhis fair-bosom'd friend, My spiteful foe, his eye, my eye sore, honey To him, my gallâWith him be not you angryâ Or, if you cannot help itâ Adel. Take a rope And hang yourself, your master, and his slaves. Mil. So! now shall I, on your account, be forc'd To feed on pottage! By your love, I've got A back as hard as any oyster-shell. Adel. Would you that I should rather interpose To save your back, than that he should be true. Ant. Give Agorastocles some gentle answer, I beg you, that he may'nt be troublesome To usâfor he detains us from our businessâ Adel. You're rightâWell, Sir, this one fault more I pardon. I am not angryâ Ago. Are you not indeed? Adel. Indeed, I'm notâ Ago. Then, that I may believe you, Seal but my pardon with a kiss. Adel. Anon, When from the sacrifice I shall return. Ago. Therefore make haste. Adel. Come, sister, follow me. Ago. And hark ye! Pay my compliments to Venus. Adel. I will. Ago. And hear this too. Adel. What is it? say. Ago. Be your devotions shortâAnd hear once moreâ TurnâLook on me.âShe turn'd towards me her eyes. Venus for this, I trust, will look upon thee. Exit Adel. Ant. and Attendant. SCENE III. Ago. Well, Milphio, what advice d'ye give me now? Mil. Why, scourge me first, and then proclaim an auction. E'en sell your house over your head at once. Ago. How so? Mil. Because your dwelling's in my mouth. Ago. Truce with this prate. Mil. What now is't you would have? Ago. E'en now I gave my bailiff Collybiscus, But just before you call'd me from the house, Three hundred PhilippÃ¦ansâI adjure you By this right hand, and by its sister here, This left; by your own eyes, and by my loves, And by my Adelphasium, and by Your libertyâ Mil. Now you adjure by nothing. Ago. My little Milphio, my friend, my guardian. Do what you promis'd; and point out the way How I may ruin this procuring rascal. Mil. An easy task!âGo bring your witnesses; While I within, with wiles and with disguise Equip your bailiff for my plot.âBe goneâ Ago. I flyâ Mil. More like to be my case than yours. Ago. And should I not, if you play well your partâ Mil. Only be gone. Ago. Your freedom give you! Mil. Go. And not to do't this very dayâDepartâ Ago. I would not take as many pieces, Iâ Mil. YouâOnly goâ Ago. As there are ghosts in hellâ Mil. Still here?â Ago. Or drops of water in the seaâ Mil. Will you depart or not?â Ago. Or clouds i'th'airâ Mil. What will you ne'er have done? Ago. Or stars in heavenâ Mil. Still din my ears?â Ago. I'd take nor this nor that, Norâin good earnest nowâNo, not by Hercules! What need of many words? Or why not shortenâ Since here we may in one word speak out freely, And yet not mean it seriouslyâBut how? 'Tis thusâNow may the gods so love me!â Would you I speak in honest faith and truth?â Which here in private you and I may do? May Jupiter so deal with meâD'you know My meaning?âDo you look to that. And don't you Believe the story now which I've been telling. Mil. If I can't make you go, I'll go myself. This speech of yours hath need of Oedipus, And Sphynx's riddle right interpretedâ [Exit Milphio. Ago. He's gone, and in a rageâI must beware Lest in the way of my amour, I lay A rub by my own faultâI'll e'en be gone And fetch the witnessesâWhere love commands, Free tho' I am, my slave I will obeyâ [Exit.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter LYCUS. LYCUS. If ever pandar, shall from this day forth, Offer at Venus' shrine one single sacrifice, Or e'en of frankincense one single grain, Him may the gods render unfortunate! For wretched I, with whom the deities I worship, are in wrath, have sacrific'd To-day six lambs; and yet have not been able To make this Venus to my vows propitious. Since I could not appease her, off I went, And in a rage forbad them cut the entrails; Nor would I look at themâI did believe The goddess undeserving, when the priest Pronounc'd the entrails inauspicious: Wherefore I chous'd the niggard deity; And made a feint. When that which was enough, She would not deem enough, I held my hand: 'Tis thus I act, and thus I ought to act. I will engage the other gods and goddesses Will sooner be contented, and less greedy, When they shall know the pandar chous'd their Venus. The soothsayer, a good for nothing chap, Mischief and loss, and angry gods denounc'd. How can I credit such a man as this, In ought divine or human; when immediately I had a present of a silver mina? But where I wonder has this captain stopp'd, Who gave it me? and whom I've ask'd to dinner. Oh! here he comesâ Enter ANTHEMONIDES. Ant. As I was telling you, You rogue, of that same pentethronic fight; When in one day full sixty thousand men, Ay, flying men, with my own hands I kill'dâ Lyc. How! flying men! Ant. Yes, I affirm it, Sir. Lyc. Are there, I pray, such things as flying men? Ant. There were; but I have kill'd them all. Lyc. And how? Ant. I'll tell youâI deliver'd to the legions Birdlime and slings; and on each sling they laid Some leaves of coltsfoot. Lyc. Why? Ant. O, to prevent The birdlime's sticking to the slings. Lyc. Proceed. You lye with a good grace, by Hercules! [aside.] What then? Ant. Some birdlime-balls of moderate size, They put into their slings; then I gave order, They on the flying men should be discharg'd. In short, whome'er the birdlime hit, they fell As thick as pears; and as each dropp'd, I strait One of his feathers run quite through his brain, And kill'd him, just as you would kill a pigeon. Lyc. If ever such a thing was done, may Jupiter Whene'er I sacrifice, ne'er grant my prayers. Ant. Don't you believe me then? Lyc. Yes, I believeâ Just as I should believe. Come, let's go in, And wait until the entrails are brought home. Ant. I long to tell you of another battle. Lyc. I mind not battles. Ant. Hearâ Lyc. By Hercules! Ant. I'll break your head, unless you either hear, Or else go hangâ Lyc. Rather go hang myselfâ Ant. And you're determin'd not to hear me then? Lyc. Determin'dâ Ant. Prithee, on this lucky day Of Venus' feast, secure me your least girl. Lyc. My holy matters take so odd a turn, I put off business to another time, For I'm resolv'd to make it holyday. Come, let's go inâFollow me this way. Ant. Yes. This day I follow you: my payâthe girlâ [Exeunt. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter AGORASTOCLES, and two WITNESSES. AGORASTOCLES. So may the gods be kind! as nothing more Provokes a man, than a slow friend; especially A man in love, who's always in a hurry. Here lead I on these crawling witnesses, Slower than loaded hulks in a calm sea. My elder friends on purpose did I wave, Knowing full well their age would make them slow, So much delays I dreaded to my love. In vain I chose these youngsters, slow as snails, Who walk in gyves. [to them.] If you'd be here to-day, Come onâOr go and hang yourselves elsewhere. Is this the expected gallop of a friend, To help the impatience of a man in love? Your steps are surely bolted through a sieve, Unless you had been taught to walk in fetters. Wit. Hark you!âTho' we plebeians seem, and poor, Bespeak us fair; or, high and mighty Sir, We want not courage to attack the wealthy. Nor care we what it is you love or hate. When we our freedom bought, our money paid for it, Not yoursâWe ought to act as freemen, nor Do value you a rushâThink not we'll be Slaves to your passionâNoâFree citizens Should through the city walk a sober pace. 'Tis only fit for slaves to hurry on. Now too, the state at peace, our foes no more, 'Twere shame to make a tumult in the streetsâ Were you in such a hurry for our help, You should have summon'd us the day before. Think not that we shall bustle through the streets; Nor have the mob throw stones at us for madmen. Ago. Had you been ask'd to dine here in the temple, A running footman or a stag you'd passâ But now because I said, as advocates And witnesses I brought you, you are gouty, And in slow motion have outdone a snail. Wit. And reason good, to run at such a rate When we at free cost eat and drink our fill: Since we make no return, but as we please. Nevertheless, tho' we are poor, at home We find sufficientâTreat us not with scorn. Whate'er our little pittance is, 'tis all At home, and we are neither dun'd, nor dun. Not one of us will burst his veins for you. Ago. You are too warmâI spoke it but in jest. Wit. Then think it was in jest we answer'd you. Ago. Good now, give me a fly-boat, not a hulk. Hobble at leastâI may not say, make haste. Wit. Go soft and fair, you're welcome to our service; But if you hurry, send for witnesses From off the turfâ Ago. You know th'affairâI've told you Wherein I want your helpâThis pandar here, Who has trick'd and baffled the poor lover long, I think between my money and my servant I have him fastâ Wit. We know all this already. If these spectators knew as much 'tis well. To pleasure them, the Comedy is actedâ More proper then to give them information; That when things come about, they understand them. Never fear usâWe know the whole affairâ We've learn'd our lesson with you, and can answer. Ago. That's true enoughâBut comeâThat I may know You comprehend the business readily, Repeat again what I've been saying to you. Wit. You're trying us?âD'you think we don't remember You gave three hundred golden PhilippÃ¦ans To Collybiscus, to your bailiff here, To carry to your enemy the pandar?â That he was to pretend he was a stranger, And of some other city, far from hence? When he has brought the gold, you thither go, To re-demand your money and your slave. Ago. You have the whole by heartâYou've sav'd my life. Wit. He'll deny all: will think you're seeking Milphio. That doubly proves the theft: and the poor pandar Decreed your slaveâAnd this you'd have us witness? Ago. You take it rightâ Wit. The affair's so very small, That we can scarcely take it 'twixt our fingers. Ago. This must be done with speed and expedition. Then make all haste that possibly you can. Wit. Oh! fare thee wellâFind nimbler witnesses; We are too slowâ Ago. You move exceeding wellâ Did you but speak as fluentlyâI wish [aside. Your thighs were in your ancles.â Wit. We, your tongue Were in your back, your eyes were in your feet. Ago. Marry! you should not be so very angry, At what I said in jestâ Wit. And you should not Thus with your idle jests, ill treat your friends. Ago. Let's drop the argumentâYou know what I want. Wit. Full wellâYou would undo this perjur'd pandar. 'Tis that's your point. Ago. You take it very right. And see, where opportunely, Milphio comes; And Collybiscus too, my bailiff, with him: He's admirably accouter'd for the plot. SCENE II. Enter MILPHIO, and COLLYBISCUS, dressed like a person of condition. Mil. [to Collybiscus.] You have your lesson well by heart?â Col. Exactly. Mil. Take care you understand it. Col. No more words. Why, your own legs don't understand you better. Mil. Come, practice all your speeches for the plot. Col. Tragic nor comic actor cannot be More perfectâ Mil. You're the man for me. Ago. I'll join them. Here are my witnesses [to Milphio.] all ready, see. Mil. You never could have found so many men, Men fit for the purpose: they have no vacation: Meer knights o'th'postâThey always live in court, And there you'll see them oftner than the PrÃ¦tor. There's not a man of law this day in Athens More fit to stir up barratry than theseâ For if no suits were found, these men would sow them. Wit. The Gods confound thee! Mil. [aside.] You into the bargain. By Hercules! in this you've acted kindly, [to the witnesses.] To aid my love-sick masterâAre they well [to Agorastocles.] Instructed in this business? Ago. In the whole of it. Mil. Well, mind me then.âKnow you this pandar, Lycus? Wit. Yes, perfectly. Col. I know him not by sight; Pray, point him outâ Wit. We shall take care of that. We have our full instructions. Ago. Here he has got [pointing to Collyb.] Three hundred pieces in full tale. Wit. But we Would see the money, Agorastocles, To know what evidence to give anon. Ago. Then look upon'tâ'tis gold. Col. Spectators, troth 'Tis play-house gold: with this well steep'd, in Barbary You might fat oxenâBut for our design, 'Tis PhilippÃ¦anâ Wit. We'll pretend it is so. Col. Pretend too, that I'm a foreigner. Wit. And that On your arrival here to-day, you ask'd us To point you out a place, where in the joys Of love and wine, you might indulge yourselfâ Mil. Thorough-pac'd rogues! Ago. For I've instructed them. Mil. And who instructed you?â Col. Come Agorastocles, Go in, for fear the pandar should discover That you are with me; some unlucky accident May then bring on a hindrance of our plot. Mil. This man's exceeding wise!âDo as he bids you. [to Agorastocles. Ago. Let's goâBut youâHave I yet said enough? [to the witnesses. Col. Pray go. Ago. I goâI ask!âImmortal gods!â Col. Why don't you go? Ago. I'm goingâ Mil. Wise to do so. [Exeunt Ago. and Milphio. Col. Hist!âsilence!âhist! Wit. What now? Col. The doors have done A thing indecent. Wit. What d'ye say? indecent? Col. They've creak'd aloud. Wit. Confound you! get behind us. Col. It shall be soâ Wit. Well, we walk first, you say. Col. SoâThese buffoons are playing their old game; They're placing of their friends behind their backs. Wit. The man you see there coming out's the pandar. Col. He's a good man, he looks so like a rogue. Now will I suck his blood, ev'n at this distanceâ SCENE III. Enter LYCUS. Lyc. Captain, I'll soon returnâI fain would find [speaking to Anthemonides within.] Some pleasant rogues to make a jolly party. Mean while they'll bring the entrails; and I fancy The girls will be return'd from sacrifice. But what's this croud? Do they bring any thing? And who is he in regimentals there? He is not of Ãtolia. Wit. Save you, Lycus. The compliment goes somewhat 'gainst the grain, For pandars are a set of people, we Have no great love forâ Lyc. As it cannot be, I wish you happy: but I'm very sure Fortune will not permit it to be soâ Wit. That's a fool's treasure hoarded in his tongue, That thinks it profit to abuse his betters. Lyc. The man who does not know his way to sea, Should always take a river for his guide. I knew not how before to abuse you well; You're rivers, and I'll surely follow you. Bless you? I'll follow as your banks shall lead. Curse you? You'll find me treading in your steps. Wit. To serve the bad, and hurt the good, alike Is dangerousâ Lyc. How so? Wit. I'll tell you how. Do a bad man a service, 'tis all lost: Injure the good, your grief will last an ageâ Lyc. Wittily said!âBut how concerns it me? Wit. 'Twas your concern that brought us for your sake, Although we do not much admire your pandars. Lyc. If you bring ought of good, I thank you for it. Wit. Good of our own we neither bring nor give, Nor promise you; nor wish you good from othersâ Lyc. Troth, I believe you nowâSo great's your bounty. But what d'ye want?â Wit. This man that you see here In regimentals, Mars is angry with. Lyc. Would he were so with you! Wit. We bring him, Lycus, To you for slaughter. Col. [aside.] SoâTo-day the sportsman Will have some game to carry homeâThe dogs Will fairly drive the wolf into the toils. Lyc. Who is he? Wit. All we know of him is this: Going to port, long after break of day, We saw him landing from a merchant man. He came to us directly from the ship; Saluted usâwhich we return'd. Col. The rogues!â How artfully they enter on the plot! [aside]. Lyc. What follow'd?â Wit. Why he join'd discourse with usâ Told us he was a stranger; with the town Quite unacquainted: wish'd some place convenient To indulge his tasteâWe've brought the man to you; And, if the gods be but propitious to you, Here is the rarest opportunity to make Your marketâ Lyc. AyâIs he so very eager? Wit. He's flush of money. Lyc. Yes, I have him sure. Wit. In love and wine he'd fain indulge himself. Lyc. A dainty place I'll find for him. Wit. But he Desires to be quite private; none to know it, No looker onâFor, as he says himself, He was a soldier of king Attalus In Sparta; and fled thence but now, the city Having surrenderedâ Col. Soldiers excellent! Sparta tops allâ Lyc. May gods and goddesses Rain blessings on you for your good advice, And giving to our hands so rich a preyâ Wit. Besides, he has brought home provender, he tells us, Three hundred pieces, golden PhilippÃ¦ans, To be receiv'd the betterâ Lyc. I'm a king, If I can draw this fellow in to-day. Wit. He's certainly your ownâ Lyc. I beg, by Hercules! You'd recommend my house; it is the best. Wit. 'Tis unbecoming us, or to persuade Or to dissuade a strangerâIf you're wise, Do your own businessâWe have lur'd the ring-dove Quite to your barn-floorâIf you'd have him caught, Best now yourself to catch him. Lyc. Are you going So soonâ Col. The affair I have intrusted to you, My friendsâ Wit. You'd better talk to him, young man. He is well skill'd in what you have in view. Col. I wish, when I deliver him the gold [to the witnesses.] You would take notice. Wit. We shall there at distance Observe it wellâ Col. [aloud.] For your good office, thanks! Lyc. [aside.] The game will all be mine.â Col. [aside.] Yes! that's according As the ass kicks! Lyc. 'Tis fit I speak him fair.â The host salutes his guestâand bids him welcome. I'm glad you are arriv'd in safety. Col. May the gods bless you, since you wish me well. Lyc. I'm told you want a lodgingâ Col. 'Tis the thing I'm looking for. Lyc. 'Twas what your friends inform'd me, Who went hence nowâYou'd have it free from fliesâ Col. By no meansâ Lyc. Why? Col. If that had been the case, I would have gone directly to a jail. No; I am looking out for such a one, Where I may be more delicately treated; More tenderly, than ever were the guests Of king Antiochus. Lyc. I can provide you One that will suit your taste, if you can like In a sweet place, a sopha neatly dress'd, A witty merry lassâ Col. You're in the right road, pandarâ Lyc. Where with Leucadian, Lesbian, Thasian, Coan, Toothless with time, you may bedew your clay An age: there costly unguents still I'll pour. The o'erseer of the bath where you shall bathe, In short shall heap a shop of perfumes on youâ But what I've said is something mercenaryâ Col. How so? Lyc. Because they must have money down. Col. You'll not receive more gladly than I give. Lyc. Follow me in thenâ Col. Lead me in then you, For I am yours, to your good pleasure boundâ [Lycus and Collybiscus go apart.] Wit. Suppose we call out Agorastocles; That he himself may be a witness, one Without exceptionâHo!âyou thief-catcher, Come out directly, haste; that you yourself May see the money given to the pandar. SCENE IV. Enter AGORASTOCLES. Ago. What now?âThe matter?â Wit. Look there to the right; Your slave is counting out the gold to Lycus. Col. [to Lycus.] Come, take 'em, come; here are three hundred pieces, All ready cash. We call them PhilippÃ¦ans. For these I would be entertain'dâI'd have them Spent speedilyâ Lyc. By Pollux! you have found A liberal steward, fitted to your purpose. Come, let's go inâ Col. I'll follow you. Lyc. March onâ Within we will discourse of what remains. Col. I'll tell you of our Spartan politicksâ Lyc. Why, therefore follow me. Col. Lead you the wayâ You hold me in a stringâ [Exeunt Lycus and Collybiscus. Ago. Well, what advise You now?â Wit. That you be temperate with your fortune. Ago. What if my inclination won't permit? Wit. Then, be it as it mayâ Ago. You saw the pandar, When he receiv'd the gold? Wit. We didâ Ago. You know This is my slaveâ Wit. Yes, that we doâ Ago. It is, You know, against the lawsâ Wit. Beyond a doubt. Ago. Mind thenâAll this I wish you to remember Before the PrÃ¦tor; where 'twill be of use. Wit. We will. Ago. Suppose I knock now at the door, While the affair is warm?â Wit. It would be right. Ago. If I should knock, he will not open it. Wit. Then break it open with your foot. Ago. Should he Come forth, it would be right to enquire of him Whether my slave is there or no? Wit. Why not? Ago. And with two hundred golden PhilippÃ¦ans? Wit. Why not? Ago. That question leads him wrongâ Wit. In what? Ago. D'ye askâBecause I've sunk an hundred piecesâ Wit. You judge quite rightâ Ago. He'll think I am enquiring For some one elseâ Wit. Undoubtedly. Ago. And will At once deny it. Wit. Ay, upon his oath. Ago. And in the guilt of theft involve himself. Wit. Doubtless. Ago. The theft of all he has receiv'dâ Wit. Why not? Ago. Now Jove confound you with your why nots! Wit. And why not you? Ago. Then will I go and knock. Wit. Why not? Ago. Time we were dumbâHark! the door creaks. He's coming out, I seeâthe rascal, Lycusâ Come this way, prayâ Wit. Why not?âAnd, if you please, Let's veil our heads, lest he should find us out; Who have decoy'd him into such a scrape. SCENE V. Enter LYCUS. Lyc. Let all diviners now go hang themselves. Why should I henceforth credit what they say? Who, in the sacrifice, e'en now foretold Some dreadful loss, and some dire mischief towardâ Since when, I have increas'd my fortune. Ago. Save you! Lyc. May the gods bless you, Agorastocles! Ago. You greet me now more civilly than usual. Lyc. 'Tis now a calm; as 'tis at sea sometimesâ I'm always us'd to shift the sail to windward. Ago. I hope the women are all well at home. For theeâI care not. Lyc. Well enough they are: But not for you. Ago. Send me this day, I prithee, This celebrated, famous day, this feast Of Venus, send me Adelphasium. Lyc. Say, has your dinner burnt your mouth to-day? Ago. How's that? Lyc. Because your question only serves To cool your chapsâ Ago. Pandar, attendâI hear My slave's with youâ Lyc. With me! You'll never find That factâ Ago. You lye.âHe came to you, and brought Some money to youâThis was told to me By those whom I can trustâ [pointing to the witnesses.] Lyc. You are a bite: And come to ensnare me with your Witnesses. There's nought of yours, people or property, At my houseâ Ago. Witnesses, remember that. Wit. We'll not forget it. Lyc. [laughing.] Now I smoke this plot. I smelt a rat beforeâThese are the men Who recommended me the Spartan stranger; 'Tis that has fir'd their brains; as, by his means, I am to get three hundred PhilippÃ¦ans. And, as they know this man to be my enemy, They've set him on to say it is his slave Who brought the gold, and is at home with me. 'Tis all a form'd contrivance how to chouse me; And to divide the plunder 'mongst themselves. From the wolf's jaws they'd snatch the lambâThey're fools. Ago. Do you deny my money and my slave Are at your house? Lyc. I do deny it, flat; And would till I was hoarse, were there occasionâ Wit. You're in a cleft stick, pandarâ'Tis his bailiff We told you was the Spartan, and who brought you Three hundred Philippeans; and the money Is in that purseâ Lyc. The plague now light upon you. Wit. That has already lighted upon you. Ago. Hang-dog! give up the purseâYou're prov'd a thief, You're taken with the mannerâPray attend, [to the witnesses.] And see me bring my slave out of his house. [goes into the Lycus's house.] Lyc. Now I'm undone indeedâWithout a doubt, This snare was laid designedly to catch me. But why do I delay to hang myself, E're neck and heels I'm dragg'd before the PrÃ¦torâ Out on't! what sad soothsayers I have had! If ought of good they promise, it comes slowly; If ought of ill, it speeds with instant hastâ Now will I go, consult my friends, which way, They think the very bestâto hang myself. [Exit Lycus. SCENE VI. Re-enter AGORASTOCLES, driving out COLLYBISCUS. Ago. Walk out here, that the witnesses may see [to Collybiscus.] You come from thenceâWell! is not this my slave? [to the witnesses.] Col. Most truly, Agorastocles, I amâ Ago. What now, thou wicked pandar! Wit. With whom d'ye rate thus? He's sneak'd awayâ Ago. I hope, sneak'd to the gallows. Wit. We hope so tooâ Ago. I'll summon him to court To-morrowâ Col. Any more commands for me? Ago. Go; you may take your regimentals with you. Col. I was not made a soldier then in vain. I got a little plunder there within. While the rogue's family was fast asleep, I made a noble meal upon the entrails. And now I'll march off home. Ago. My friends, You've kindly dealt with me, and lent me too Your fair assistanceâI beseech you meet me Early to-morrow in the courtâYou follow me. [to Collybiscus.] Farewell to bothâ [to the witnesses.] Wit. The same farewell to you. [Exeunt Agor. and Col.] He does us a notorious wrong to think We are to serve him at our own expence. Such is the disposition of our rich ones! Serve them, their thanks are lighter than a feather; Offend them, and their vengeance falls like lead. Come, let us home; since we have done our work, And ruin'd this corrupter of our youth. [Exeunt.] End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter MILPHIO. MILPHIO. I wait to know what way my plot proceedsâ 'Tis my whole bent to ruin this same rogue.â Just as he teazes my unhappy master, My master with his fist and foot returns The same to me.âIt is a curse to serve A man in love: chiefly, if he's debarr'd The object of his loveâSee! Syncerastus The pandar's slave, here coming from the temple!â I'll list to what he saysâ SCENE II. Enter SYNCERASTUS. Syn. 'Tis clear enough That gods as well as men, shew little favour To a poor fellow, servant to a master No better than himself; and such a one Is now my lot.âThere is not to be found In all the earth, a more perfidious man, Or more malicious than my master is; No man so dirty, none so base a scoundrelâ By heavens! I'd rather spend my life in quarries, Or at the mill, with fetters heavy laden, Than live this pandar's slaveâGods! what a kind Of mortals these!âHow they debauch the world! Save me, good heavens!âevery sort of men Is in their quarters to be seen; 'tis just As if you were arriv'd at Acheron. A knight, or a foot-soldier would you see, A libertine, or thief, or run-away Scourg'd or imprison'd, or to slavery Let him have been condemn'd, has he but money, He's welcome, and you'll find him thereâNo man's Deny'd: and therefore all the house is darkned; And hiding places every where aboundâ Guzzling and gormandising every corner Is full of, just as in a tipling-house. There you may see, in earthen ware inscrib'd Epistolary tablets, seal'd with pitch. Letters a cubit long compose the names With which they're mark'dâThus 'tis, that in our cellar At home, we have a muster-roll of vintnersâ Mil. All this is wonderful, by Pollux' temple! Unless this slave be made his master's heir. For this soliloquy seems spoke o'er Lycus, As if he were quite deadâI long to accost This fellowâTho' at the same time I hearken Most willingly to what he's talking of himself. Syn. When I see here these doings, heartily I'm vex'd to think, that slaves the best and costliest, Should at our house be stript of the small stock, Which for themselves they were allow'd to earn. For what is idly got, is idly spent. Mil. This rogue holds forth as he were good for somewhat, When he, by Hercules! could teach e'en idleness To be more idleâ Syn. From the temple now I bring these vessels homeâMy master could not With all his victims gain the goddess' smiles. No, not upon her festivalâ Mil. [apart.] Sweet Venus! Syn. Our girls howe'er, with their first offerings softned Venus at onceâ Mil. [apart.] Again I say, sweet Venus! Syn. Now I'll go homeâ Mil. Hola! Why, Syncerastus! Syn. Who calls? Mil. A friendâ Syn. It is not like a friend To stop me, when he sees I'm loaded thusâ Mil. But I will serve you in return for this, Whene'er you please, and where you shall command. Account the agreement sign'dâ Syn. I'll serve you then In this, if you'll hereafterâ Mil. What? Syn. Why only When I am to be scourg'd, present your back For meâ Mil. Be hang'dâ Syn. I know not what you are. Mil. I'm good for nothingâ Syn. Be so to yourself thenâ Mil. I've somewhat I would say to youâ Syn. But my burthen Won't let me stayâ Mil. Why, lay it down by you, And turn your face to meâ Syn. Well then, I do soâ Yet I want leisureâ Mil. Save you, Syncerastus! Syn. Ah! Milphio! now may gods and goddesses All blessâ Mil. Bless whom? Syn. Not you; no, nor myself; Nor yet my masterâ Mil. Whom then? Syn. Any one Besides:âfor none of us deserve a blessingâ Mil. Cleverly said! Syn. I say but what is rightâ Mil. But what is't you're now doing?â Syn. I am doing What it appears adult'rers rarely do. Mil. What's that? Syn. I'm bringing home my vessels safeâ Mil. Thee and thy master too, may gods confound! Syn. Me they may spare, that him they may destroyâ I could, if I'd a mind, so manage matters, That he, my master, would be surely ruin'd; But that I tremble, Milphio, for myselfâ Mil.

No, you should say quite otherwiseâ For how can you fare badly, when at home Victuals and mistresses you have in plenty, Nothing to pay: not the least present e'er To a she-friend expectedâ Syn. But may Jupiter So bless me!â Mil. As you want merit to be blest. Syn. As I could wish this family may perishâ Mil. If then you wish it, lend a helping handâ Syn.

I should do ill to trust thee; And yet I willâ Mil. You know my master is Sworn enemy to yours? Syn. I know he isâ Mil. About his love affairâ Syn. Why there you've lost Your labourâ Mil. AyâHow so? Syn. You teach your grannamâ Mil. Doubt not, my master will most willingly Do all the mischief in his power to yours. And would you but assist, it will be done With much more easeâ Syn. But, Milphio, there's one thing I fearâ Mil. What is't? Syn. Lest while I'm laying snares Here for my master, you're betraying meâ For should he know I've told it any mortal, He'd break my bonesâ Mil. No soul shall know't from me, Except my masterâNor, but on condition He give no hint the notice comes from you. Syn. I scarce can trust you; yet I think I'll do it. Be sure you keep it secret tho'â Mil. Not Faith Herself you can more safely trustâOut with itâ Both time and place inviteâWe are here aloneâ Syn. Your master, Milphio, would he act with caution, Might ruin mineâ Mil. How? how? Syn. Why easilyâ Mil. Let's hear your easily, that he may know itâ Syn. Why, Adelphasium, whom your master doats on, Is free by birthâ Mil. How so?â Syn. In the same way As is her sister Anterastilis. Mil. How prove you that?â Syn. Because he bought them both At Anactorium in their infancy, For eighteen minÃ¦, of a Sicilian pirateâ Mil. For how much did you say? Syn. For eighteen minÃ¦. Mil. What, both?â Syn. Ay, and a third, their nurse besides. The man who sold them, own'd them to be stolenâ Nay, said that they were free, and born at Carthage. Mil. Good heavens! how happily things come about? My master Agorastocles, born too At Carthage, was thence stolen at six years oldâ Brought hitherâHe was sold to my old master; Who when he died, adopted him his heir. Syn. All this will doâTo effect it the more easily, Let him assert their freedom, as he may, Being their countrymanâ Mil. Then say no more. Syn. Our pandar's at last gasp, should he demand themâ Mil. He shall not stir a foot, before he's ruin'd; I've so contriv'd itâ Syn. Heaven grant it so! That I may serve this pandar here no more. Mil. You shall for this, my fellow-freedman be, An't please the godsâ Syn. And may it please the gods! Would you ought else with me?â Mil. Nothing at all: But fare you well, and happiness attend you. Syn. Troth, that's in yours, and in your master's power. FarewellâUnder the rose tho' this, observeâ Mil. Just as if nothing had been saidâAdieu! Syn. Strike while the iron's hot, or else 'twill end In smokeâ Mil. The advice is goodâIt shall be soâ Syn. Excellent stuff we have to work upon! Provide you but as excellent a workmanâ Mil. Can't you be silentâ Syn. I am dumb, and vanishâ Mil. A glorious opportunity you've given meâ [Exit Syncerastus.] He's goneâ'Tis plain intended by the gods, My master's safety, and this pandar's ruin: Such instant mischief hovers o'er his head! Before one half takes place, another follows! I'll in, and tell my master every thingâ For should I call him hither, 'fore the door, And here repeat what you've already heard, [to the spectators.] It were a solecismâI had much rather Offend one man, my master here within, Than all you hereâImmortal gods! what mischief, What misery now awaits this pandar here. But how I tarryâThis affair begun, Brooks no delayâTo-night we will consult; And what our privy-council shall determine, Will followâBut if longer here I loiter, Who breaks my head, will serve me rightâI'll in; And wait my master's coming from the Forum.

But Agorastocles, his son, they say, Inhabits hereâThis hospitable ticketâ And image of the hospitable god, I bring along with meâI am inform'd He lives within this neighbourhoodâI'll enquire Of these two men, who now are coming forthâ [seeing Agorastocles and Milphio.] SCENE II. Enter AGORASTOCLES and MILPHIO. Ago. Say'st thou then Milphio, Syncerastus told thee That these two girls are neither of them slaves; But free; of noble birth; and stolen from Carthage? Mil. Yes, I affirm itâAnd I add this likewise, If you had spirit, you would claim them both As freeâTroth! 'tis a baseness in you, To suffer your own countrywomen here Before your eyes to be pent up, and treated As slaves, meer slaves, who once, at home were freeâ Han. [apart.] These mens discourse is musick to my heart. My ears devour their words; and every syllable Chears up my mind, and kindles hope anew. Ago. [to Milphio.] Had I but evidence of this, your project Should instantly be put in practiceâ Mil. Evidence! What tell you me of evidence?âInsist Most strenuously upon itâUnknown good fortune Will come and aid your purposeâ Ago. This attempt May be indeed begun with ease; but not Brought to the wish'd event so easilyâ Mil. But see! what is that creature, who comes forward In his long robes?âReturns he from the baths, [seeing Hanno, and his servants.] Thus muffled in his cloak? A Carthaginian To read him by his countenanceâAnd with him He has, you see, some antiquated slavesâ Ago. How know you that? Mil. They're loaded with his baggage. They have, it seems, no fingers on their hands. Ago. Whence comes that idle fancy? Mil. Why, they carry Their rings upon their earsâI'll e'en accost them, And speak to them in PunicâIf they answer, I'll chatter on in PunicâBut if not, My tongue shall speak some language they are us'd to. But what say you?âHave you forgot your Punic? Ago. I haveâHow could I otherwiseâNo phrase Do I remember of itâWhen stolen from Carthage, I was but six years oldâ Han. [apart.] How many children Free born, are stolen from Carthage in this manner! Mil. What say you, Sir? Ago. What is't you ask? Mil. Inform me, Is it your will I speak to him in Punic? Ago.

Go, and accost him thenâEnquire his purpose, Why he comes hitherâWho he isâWhat countryman, And whence?âSpare not, but sift him thoroughly. Mil.

He says his name is Hanno, The son of Mythymbal, and comes from Carthageâ Han. All hail to bothâ Mil. He hails us bothâ Han. My masters. Mil. Sure 'tis some gift he means to offer you. You hear him promise. Ago. In my name again Return his compliment, and bid him welcome. Mil. In his own name, my master bids you welcome. Han. Oh! what a son of tears! Mil. That be thy portion; But leave it not to me. Ago. What is't he says? Mil. He says his jaws are very painful, Sirâ Perhaps he may mistake us for physicians. Ago. If that be his opinion, undeceive him This instantâTell him we are notâA stranger Should never be deceiv'dâ Mil. We are no doctorsâ Ago.

Open your doorsâ Ago. What says he?â Han. Give to Saturn A welcome entrance, I intreatâ Ago. What asks he? Mil. Why, hear you not he talks of mice from Africa, To be presented at the Ãdile games, To publick view? Han. The messenger, who asks A safe abode, and kind endurance hereâ Ago. Well, my interpreter, what says he now? Mil. He tells us, he has bought some petty wares, Shoe-straps and water-pipes, and nuts to part with: And now he begs you'd help him in the sale. Ago. Sure he's some merchant then!â Han. Us strangers hereâ Ago. What? How?â Han. Admit at once in hospitable guiseâ Ago. Interpret, Milphio, what is it he says? Mil. He tells you he has spades and forks for sale, For garden use, and sickles for our corn. I fancy he comes here against your harvest. Ago. What is all this to me? Mil. 'Tis my intent You should be well inform'd of all his traffick, Lest you should fancy I conceal one syllable. Han. 'Tis on your deities, before invok'd, On their accountâ Mil. Hem!âBe not over hasty To traffick with himâ Ago. What is it he says? What's his request?âExplain itâ Mil. He beseeches To end his misery, you would place him under A hurdle; and heap stones enough upon it, To kill him quite, and finish all his sorrows. Han. Answer, O Baal! great lord of heaven and earth! Ago. What! How!âInterpret to me what he says. Mil. Why here indeed, I'm puzzled quite, and know not A single word he utters.â Han. You shall not long Be puzzled, I assure youâFor henceforth I'll speak in Latin plainly, and inform you I know your knaveryâ'Tis not the sign Of a good faithful servant, thus to sneer, And spend your wit on an unhappy stranger. Mil. I know you well, a sycophant, a cheat, Come hither with your jargon to deceive usâ A crawling serpent with your forked tongueâ Ago. Forbear ill language, Milphio, curb your tongue, If wise, henceforth you will forbear reproaches, Or you shall smart severelyâI'll not suffer you Thus to abuse my countrymanâRemember That I myself to Carthage owe my birthâ Han. My countryman, all hail!â Ago. All hail again I cordially return, whoe'er you are. If I in ought can serve you, speak, command me, And take my service for the sake of Carthageâ Han. With my best thanks your kindness I receive. I think, I have a friend to entertain meâ I'm seeking now for Agorastocles, Antidamas's sonâDirect me to him, If he be known to youâAre you acquainted With such a youth as Agorastocles? Ago. Son by adoption to Antidamas,! Antidamas, whose father was Damarchus! If you enquire for him, the very person Stands talking with you nowâMyself am he. Han. Good heaven! What is't I hear?â Ago. You hear that I'm Antidamas's sonâ Han. If this be so, Compare my hospitable ticket.âHere, Look at it: I have brought it with me; seeâ Ago. Pray let me see it thenâExactly true! It tallies well with that I have at homeâ [looking at it.] Han. Most worthy host, all hail! Your father formerlyâ Once, formerly, your father was my guestâ This hospitable token from Antidamas Did I receive at partingâ [shewing it.] Ago. In return, As he was yours, so you shall be my guest. I bid you doubly welcome, as from Carthage My native placeâ Han. Heaven give you all you wish! But say?âBy what strange fate, if born at Carthage, Did an Ãtolian take you for his son? Ago. From Carthage I was stol'nâAntidamas Your former guest, first purchas'd me a slave, And for his son at length adopted me. Han. Antidamas was by Demarchus too Adopted.âBut no more of himâTo you I must confine my questionsâPray inform me, Remember you your parents' names? Ago. The names Of both I do remember perfectly. Han. Repeat them instantlyâPerhaps I knew them. They might perhaps be also of my kindredâ Ago. My mother's was AmpsiguraâMy father's Jachonâ Han. O would that they were living now! Ago. Are they both dead? Han. Both, to my grief unutterable. Ampsigura, your mother, was my kinswoman, My cousin-germanâAnd your father Jachon My uncle's sonâDying, he left me heir To his estateâHis loss I bear most heavily. But if you be indeed the son of Jachon, On your left hand there is a scarâA monkey Bit you, a boy, as you was playing with him. Shew me your open hand, and let me view it. Ago. See thenâ'Tis thereâAll hail! my dearest kinsman. Han. All hail! again to Agorastoclesâ In finding thee, I seem to live anew. Mil. In troth, it pleases me that things fall out So happily for bothâShall I advise A word or two?â Han. Most willinglyâYou may. Mil. The father's fortune then of right is his, And 'tis but justice that his son should be His father's heir, and take his whole estateâ Han. I mean no otherâAll shall be restor'dâ I will diminish nothing, when he comes To Carthageâ Mil. Nay, restore it, tho' he should Continue to live here. Han. He shall have mine Beside, whene'er I dieâ Mil. A lucky thought Just comes across meâ Han. What is't?â Mil. We shall need Your helping hand.â Han. Speak, and explain yourself. My best assistance you may use most freely.â What is the business?â Mil. Could you play a part? Han. Yes, on an enemyâTo cheat a friend Were meer absurdityâ Mil. A foe to him, [pointing to Agorastocles.] He is undoubtedlyâ Han. With all my heart, I'll do him an ill turnâ Mil. My master, here Fancies a girl this pandar has in keeping. Han. Discretely, sure!â Mil. This pandar lives hard by. Han. Does he?âMost willingly I'll play upon him. Mil. He has at home two girls; two sisters are they, He keeps for traffickâOne of these my master Is desperately in love withâBut has never Once touch'd herâ Han. An unhappy passion! Mil. Now This pandar plays on himâ Han. To enhance his merchandize. Mil. My master here would cheat him in his turn. Han. He's right, if he can do itâ Mil. This contrivance Is labouring in my brainâThe plan is thusâ My plot must turn upon youâWe shall cite you To vouch them your two daughters, and both freeâ That they were stolen from Carthage, and re-claim them. You fully comprehend it?â Han. But too well. Two daughters of my own, were stol'n like them, When little children, with their nurse. Mil. Most happily You make a parallelâWe set out finelyâ Han. A parallel more perfect than I wish it. [aside, weeping.] Mil. [aside.] Alas!âIn troth, we've got a subtle mortal, [to Agorastocles.] A wily, cunning, tricking, artful knave: See how he whimpers!âEvery gesture shews An able actorâWhy, he tops e'en me, The very architect of fraudâ Han. Their nurseâ Explain to me her personâ Mil. Not o'er tall. Dusky her hue. Han. Ay, ay, the very same, No doubtâ Mil. Her form agreeableâ Her mouth is small, her eyes as black as jet. Han. Her very form you have describ'd exactly. Mil. Choose you to see her?â Han. I would rather choose To see my daughtersâBut go thou and call her.â If they're indeed my daughters, she their nurse, She'll know me instantlyâ Mil. Within!âWho's there? Tell Giddeneme to come forth directlyâ Here's one has business of importance with herâ SCENE III. Enter GIDDENEME, and BOY. Gid. Who is it knocks? Mil. A very near acquaintance. Gid. What is your business? Mil. Hark you, Giddeneme, Is that same long-sleev'd man there your acquaintance? Gid. Who is't I see? O Jupiter supreme! Why 'tis my very master, and the father Of my two mistressesâHanno 'tis of Carthage. Mil. Look again, gipseyâThis same Punic juggler Is at his art most excellentâIn troth He carries all before himâ Gid. O, my master, All hail!âAll hail to Hannoâto myself, And to thy daughters much unhop'd for, welcome. Nay, wonder not, nor gaze so fix'd upon me. Know you not Giddeneme, your poor slave? Han. I know thee wellâBut where are my two daughters? That is my first concernâ Gid. In Venus' temple. Han. What do they there?âInform meâ Gid. 'Tis the feast Of Venus: and they're gone to pray the goddess To be propitious to themâ Mil. Yes, indeed! Their prayers have well succeeded, now he's come! Ago. What then, are these his daughters? Gid. Certainly. Your kindness at this time most critical, Hath sav'd us allâThis dayâThis very day Their names were to be chang'd, to the vile purpose Of common prostitution:âboth devoted For hire, as slaves, to that abandon'd trade. Boy. Shall not I bid him welcome? Gid. Child, remember, They are at Venus' festival; as yet The time's not properâHold your peace at present, And keep the Captain ignorant of this. Ago. Tell me what 'tis they say to one another. [to Milphio.] Mil. The boy salutes his mother; she, her son. Han. Peace! let alone the female conversation. Ago. What female conversation? Han. Why, loud talk, Without all meaning, and beyond all measure. Do thou [to Milphio.] then take these home along with thee; And take the nurse tooâ Ago. Strictly you obey him. Mil. But who then will be here to find his daughters? Ago. Myself shall do that office most exactly. Mil. I go thenâ Ago. GoâDon't tell me so, but go This momentâLet a supper be got ready, For my dear kinsmanâ Mil. Herbs may serve your turn. [to Hanno's slaves.] I shall [aside.] take care to set you to the mill, Then to the water-wheel; where each shall wear A trusty clog, when tardy, at his heels. Ye shall have slender cause to praise your keeping. Ago. But, kinsman, let me speakâAnd you must grant me What I now ask youâPromise me in marriage Your eldest daughterâ Han. Granted willingly. Ago. Indeed! And do you promise? Han. From my heart. Ago. Again, hail kinsman! Now you're mine, indeed! Now shall I visit her at last with freedom! And, kinsman, would you see your daughter, follow me. Han. I willâI from my soul have wish'd it long. Ago. What if we meet them, as we pass? Han. I fear Lest we should pass themâJupiter supreme! At last restore my hopes, and make me happy. Ago. I hope my charmer will be mine for ever. But look! I see them coming. Han. These my daughters! How wonderously grown!â Ago. Nay, wonder notâ They're Grecian columns, tall and elegant. Mil. I fancy, what to-day I said in joke, May turn out quite the truth, a serious matter, That these two girls are certainly his daughters. Ago. By heaven 'tis past all doubtâMilphio, do you Take home your guestsâOurs we shall wait for here. [Exit Milphio.] SCENE IV. Enter ADELPHASIUM and ANTERASTILIS, from the temple of VENUS. Ant. Whoever hath a taste for elegance, And visited the goddess' shrine to-day, To feast his eyes, found it well worth his pains. By Castor's temple, I was charm'd myself To see how elegant the offerings were; Worthy the queen of elegance herself! Who could despise the honours of her day, Where such variety of beauties met, Each plac'd with art and nice propriety? Odours of myrrh, and all Arabia's sweets, Breath'd round. Thy fane and festival, O goddess, Shone equal; such a croud of votaries To Caledonian Venus bow'd. For us, Our influence prevail'd, aton'd with ease, For we were fair: nor were we, like the rest, The may-game of the youth. Adel. I'd rather, sister, Others should find it so, than you be left To praise yourself. Ant. Sister, I wish so too. Adel. And I.âSince well I know the difference Between ourselves and others.âBorn as we are, Shame should preserve us pure, and free from vice. Han. Great Jove! who dost preserve and guard mankind, By whom we live and breathe this vital air, On whom depends the hope of human life, Make this day prosperous to my affairs. Grant liberty to those, whom I, for years Have mourn'd, and from their native country lost Ev'n in their infancy; that I may know For unremitting piety, there is A due rewardâ Ago. Great Jove, I will engage Shall grant your wishâHe stands in awe of me. Han. Forbear, forbear such impious discourse. Ago. Uncle, weep notâ Ant. Sister, how pleasant 'tis To bear away the palm of victory! Our beauty clearly won the prize to-day. Adel. You're not so wise as I could wish, my sister. Why sure, because you have 'scap'd ridicule, You do not therefore think yourself a beauty. Ago. Uncle, my uncle of all uncles uncle.â Han. Kinsman, my son, what would you have? Ago. Attend Upon this business. Han. I'm about it. Ago. Uncle, My best, my dearest uncleâ Han. What's the matter? Ago. How pretty, elegant, and wise she is? Han. She has her father's disposition then In thatâ Ago. In what?âThe wisdom she deriv'd From you, she has worn out long sinceâTo me And to my love, she owes her wisdom now. Adel. Sister, such is our birth, tho' now we're slaves, We can't consistent with our character, Do any thing would bring us in contempt. Women have many faults, and of the many, This is the chief; delighted with themselves, Too great a zeal they have to please the men. Ant. Excess of joy, the omen for our sacrifice! And what the soothsayer has foretold of both. Ago. I hope he prophesied no less of me. Ant. That in few days, in spite of our old master, We should regain our libertyâAnd yet, Unless our parents and the gods assist, I know no room for hope. Ago. 'Twas trust in me That made the soothsayer promise them their liberty, Because I lov'd this girl. Adel. Follow this way. [to Anterastilis.] Ant. I follow. Han. If convenient, stop a moment. Adel. Who calls us back? Ago. One who desires to serve you. Adel. There's need enough of thatâBut who is he? Ago. Your friendâ Adel. And so is every one, who is not My foeâ Ago. He's a good man, my love. Adel. I'd rather Have such a man my friend, than one who's bad. Ago. If you'd engage in friendship, none so fit To be your friend. Adel. I do not now propose it. Ago. He longs to do you many services. Adel. He proves his worth, by serving those who're good. Han. I'll give you joy. Adel. And pleasure to yourself. Han. And liberty to youâ Adel. At such a price You purchase us for ever for your ownâ Ago. If I were Jove, I'd marry this dear girl, And turn old Juno out of doorsâHow fitly, How decent, how consid'rately she talk'd! And with what modesty she fram'd her speech! She must, she shall be mine. Han. How artfully [to Agorastocles.] I play'd my part? Ago. Yes, handsomely, by Hercules! Cleverly tooâ Han. Return then to the charge Ago. Proceed, be shortâThe pit I see is thirstyâ Han. Why loiter we? Let us complete our business. I summon you before the magistrate. Ago. Then seize them, uncleâ Han. Seize them then yourself, If you are wiseâ Ago. And do you bid me seize This fair one? Han. Hold her fast. Adel. And is this man Truly your uncle, Agorastocles? Ago. I'll make you know that presentlyâI'll be Sweetly reveng'd on youâI swear by Pollux! That you shall be my brideâ Han. Come, come away Before the magistrate; nor wast the time. Ant. Be you a witness for me, and lead on. Ago. I'll witness for youâHer I will embrace And love thatâso I would have said,âbut I Have spoke my wishes. Han. Still, you loiter here. I summon you againâYou would not sure Be drag'd by force. Adel. Why summon us? Are we In debt to you? Ago. Ask him that question. Adel. Does My own cur bark at me? Ago. Yet, pat me but A little, feed me with a kiss or two, You'll make your cur as gentle as a lamb. Han. Come on, unless you would be carriedâ Adel. How Have we offended you? Han. You're thievesâ Adel. We thieves? Han. Both thievesâ Ago. I know it to be true. Adel. What robbery Is this? Ago. Ask him there. Han. You've for many years Conceal'd my daughters: women of distinction, Free, and of highest birthâ Adel. You'll never prove us Guilty of such a villainyâ Ago. I'll bet A kiss, you've said what's false. I care not whether I win or loseâ Adel. I have no business with youâ Be goneâ Ago. Ay, but by Hercules! you haveâ He is my uncle; I'm in duty bound To be his advocate; and I'll inform him How many thefts you're guilty of; and how You keep for slaves his daughters, whom you know Free-born, and from their native country stolen. Adel. Where, or who are they, pray? Ago. They're teiz'd enough. [to Hanno.] Han. Shall I discoverâ? Ago. Now's the time, good uncle. Adel. Sister, I dread this matterâhow 'twill endâ I am so sunk and spiritless. Han. Attend, Both of you, hear.âAnd first, I could have wish'd The gods, if possible, had spar'd your innocence. For what their gracious wills have done for me, For you, and for your nurse, we ought to give them Eternal thanks, for that they have been pleas'd To honour and approve our pietyâ You are my daughtersâAgorastocles Is your relation, my own brother's son. Adel. Good heavens! do they mislead us with false hopes? Ago. So may the gods protect me! as 'tis sure He is your fatherâCome, give him your handsâ Adel. Our father, our unhop'd for father, hail! Indulge us in one dear embrace. Han. My daughters, My dearest, my long wish'd-for children, Oh!â Ant. My father! we are both of us your daughters, Let both of us embrace you. Ago. Who shall after Embrace poor me? Han. Now I indeed am happy. Whole years of misery are now repaid With joy! Adel. We scarce can think it credible. Han. 'Twill be more credible, when I inform you, Your nurse did at first sight acknowledge me. Adel. Where, I beseech you, is she? Han. At his house. [pointing to Agorastocles.] Ago. Why do you hang upon his neck so long? Before he has promis'd you in marriage to me. Adel. I've doneâ Ago. Hail! mine that is to be! [kissing and embracing her.] Adel. Pray spare Your compliment. Ago. And hail too, Anterastilis! Ant. Forbear, you teize me. Han. Let's now arm in arm Unite, and henceforth form the band of friendship. Who are on earth more happy? Ago. Worth finds here Her due reward!âHe has reach'd at length his wishes! O Zeuxis! O Apelles! why are you Now number'd with the dead? when here's a subject Of your great pencils worthy, far above The touch of meaner handsâ Han. To you, ye gods, What thanks, what gratitude I justly owe, Who thus have fill'd my heart with joy and gladness, And brought my daughters to my widow'd arms! Adel. The just reward of fatherly affection! Ago. Now uncle, call to mind your former promise, That gave your eldest daughter to my vows. Han. I've not forgot it. Ago. Nor forget her fortune. SCENE V. Enter ANTHEMONIDES. Anthe. If I am not reveng'd, and smartly too, For that same mina, which I gave the rascal, May I a common may-game be; the scoff Of foolsâThe beast has brought me here to dine; And he is gone abroad himself; while I Am left, forsooth, his knaveship's hall-keeperâ Neither the Pandar, nor the girls return'd; And not a scrap to eatâ'Stead of my dinner, I laid my hands on this, and so march'd out. I'll pay himâIt shall be in soldier's coin. [drawing his sword.] He thinks he has found his man, whom he may cheat. Would I could meet now, while my choler's up, This mistress, I'd so baste her with my fists, I'd make a mulberry of her; she should look Blacker than any Ethiop, or the knaves Who carry buckets at the publick games. [Here both the daughters run to their father.] Adel. O hold me fast, dear Sir, I dread that kiteâ [seeing Anthemonides.] It is a ravenous birdâlest he should seize Your chick. Ant. I cannot hold you fast enough, My fatherâ Anthe. But I loiter here: with this I might have bought a dinnerâHey! what's this! What's this I see? How! What!âa duplicate! A strange conjunctionâWho's this fellow here, With his long skirts so like a tavern boy? Do I see clear? Can that be Anterastilis, My flame?â'Tis she, as sure as I'm alive. I've for some time perceiv'd she slighted me. But is she not asham'd, i'th'publick street To embrace a tawny moor? I'll send this rascal Strait to the gallowsâThese long skirted fellows Are mighty women's-men. But I'll accost her, This negro-loving hussey!âHolla! Youâ Woman, to you I speakâAr't not asham'd? What business, fellow, hast thou with that woman? Han. Youth, save youâ Anth. I will not be sav'dâWhat is't To you? How dare you touch this girl? Han. It lik'd me. Anthe. It lik'd you?â Han. Yes, it lik'd me. Anthe. Strap, go hang thee. Dar'st thou turn lover, thou! thou hop o'my thumb! Dar'st thou pretend to be a man, thou eel-skin, Thou leathern bucket, frowzy vest; thou stinkest Of leeks and garlick, worse than Roman rowers. Ago. Ho! younker!âDo your cheeks or shoulders itch, That you affront this man: and do you want A drubbing? Anthe. Why dost not accompany Thy railing with a drum? for thou'rt a priest Of Cybele, I think; and not a man. Ago. I'll make you know how I'm a priestâCome out, My slaves, and bring the cudgelsâ Anthe. Do not take In earnest, what I only said in jest. Ant. How can you, Anthemonides, delight To abuse my father and my cousin thus? This is our fatherâBut this very now He found us out; and this, his brother's son. [meaning Agorastocles.] Anthe. May Jupiter so love me, as I'm glad. It is a lucky chance; it chears my heart. I'm glad of any ruin to this pandar; And that your fortune's equal to your virtues. Ant. Troth, what he says is probable, my fatherâ Believe himâ Han. Well, I doâ Ago. And so do I.â Look, see the pandar Lycus! the good man! Look, look! I see himâHe is coming home. Han. Who is this man? Ago. Or Lycus, or the pandar: Which e'er you pleaseâYour daughters were his slaves; And he's the rascal that has stolen my gold. Han. A precious fellow you're acquainted with! Ago. Drag him before the PrÃ¦tor. Han. By no means. Ago. Why so? Han. Because I'd better bring my action. SCENE VI. Enter LYCUS. No one, in my opinion, is deceiv'd, Who fairly lays his case before his friends. All mine, and even to a man, advise That I should rather hang myself, than be Decreed a slave to Agorastocles. Ago. Pandar, we'll to the magistrate. Lyc. I beg you, Do, prithee, give me leave to hang myselfâ [to Agorastocles.] Han. Pandar, I summon you before the PrÃ¦tor. Lyc. What business have you with me? Han. Business, say you? Why, I affirm my daughters were born free, Women of rank; and with their nurse were stolen, When childrenâ Lyc. That I knew some time ago; And wonder'd much, that none e'er came to claim them. They certainly are none of mine. Anthe. And, Pandar, I also summon youâ Lyc. I owe a dinnerâ Well, you shall have itâ Ago. I must be paid double Of what you've stolenâ Lyc. Take it then from henceâ [pointing to his neck.] Han. What pains and penalties to me you owe! Lyc. Take what you pleaseâ Anthe. And take for me a mina. Lyc. Take it from hence: [meaning his neck.] one hanging pays you all. Ago. Do you object to my demand? Lyc. I do not. Ago. Then, in, my girlsâAnd, uncle, don't forget That you betrotheâ Han. I mean no less. Anthe. Farewell. Ago. Adieu! Anthe. I take this pawn here for my mina. [laying hold on Lycus.] Lyc. Oh! I'm undoneâ Ago. Ay, so indeed you will be, When you appear in court. Lyc. To save that trouble, I here acknowledge, I'm your slaveâNo need To go before the PrÃ¦torâBut I beg you, Let me but pay the simple sumâI think I can scrape up three hundred PhilippÃ¦ans; And on the morrow I'll proclaim an auction. Ago. With all my heartâso you remain with me In wooden hold. Lyc. Content. Ago. Let's in then, uncle, And celebrate this feast with jollity, For our success, and for the Pandar's ruin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the SPECTATORS. A long farewel, for we have been long winded. The cloud of ills at length has broke upon The Pandar's headâNothing is wanting now, But seasoning to our Comedy; which, if You have been pleas'd, you'll give, with your applause. [Exeunt.</field>
