      <field name="fulltext">Scene I. —The Theban Council-chamber. Adelpates, Councillors, Courtiers, Guards, &amp;c., seated. Ade. My lords and gentlemen,—no matter small Is that which has induced us you to call To meet thus in the midst of the recess. The fact is this,—our country's in a mess; Evils of no small kind the nation worry— Enter Mercury quickly. Mer. Here, stop a minute—don't be in a hurry! [All start and rise angrily. Ade. Holloa! of manners here's a precious breach! To come and interrupt the royal speech! Who are you? Mer. Don't you know me by my wings? I'm Mercury, the god of lots of things— Trade, shepherds, arts, law, eloquence, reciters, But principally thieves and comic writers. And if my bus'ness here you would enquire, 'Tis to oblige the authors, “by desire.” I don't know what it is they see about me, But they declared they couldn't do without me. [To the audience. Between ourselves, mind, and our royal host, [Pointing to Adelpates. Who's quite equivalent to any post, The facts are these:—the scene of this affair, Is laid in Thebes, whereof, as you're aware, All the inhabitants are such sad fools— Ade. Ha!—(angrily.) Mer. Pooh! the fact's well known; it's taught in schools So stupid all Bœotia's known to be, That a Bœ-otian don't know A, B, C. Well, as the best of jokes and situations Oft stand in need of trifling explanations, Which these poor Thebans couldn't give, d'ye see? The authors thought they'd just apply to me. And so—though doubtless some have been before us With the idea—I'm here to act as Chorus. And in that character I'll go the whole hog; So keep your places, while I sing a prologue. SONG.—Tune, “Bartlemy Fair.” You are all aware, methinks, That the celebrated Sphinx, Which by Juno's hate was sent, All Bœotia to torment, For a grudge of ancient day, Is the subject of our play,— All to fill up our classical scene, oh! Monster dread—human head— Lion's paws—nasty claws— Serpent's tail—sting and scale— Wings of bird;—how absurd! (Spoken.)All alive! all alive, oh! Here you will see that celebrated and astonishing animal, the Sphinx! found in the most wild and foggy parts of the ancient writers, and brought at an immense expense to this here establishment. It has the head of a human being, the body of a dog, the paws of a lion, the wings of a bird, the tail of a serpent, and has been pronounced by able judges to be altogether uncommonly like a whale. It will be seen alive, and has been brought here on purpose to Hey down—ho down, &amp;c. Now this droll abomination Eats up half the population; For tho' very hard he labours, He quite lives upon his neighbors. All classes by his claw Are dragged to fill his maw, And to fill up our classical scene, oh! High or low—down they go— Peer or peasant—none so pleasant— Every sinner—cooked for dinner— Fat or thin—tucks them in. (Spoken.)Step forward! step forward! with your approbation, and the animal will go through the whole of his wonderful tricks and performances. He will ask his celebrated riddles and enigmas, and eat up such of the nobility, gentry, and the public generally, as are unable to answer them. No extra charge will be made for feeding time, beyond a trifle for the showman, who has nothing to live on but your kindness. You will also see the celebrated Mr. Œdipus, the monster-tamer from Corinth, who will make his first appearance in this country, and enter the animal's den. He will stir him up, and let the ladies hear him growl, in the course of the evening, and perform many other feats of dexterity, which are Hey down—ho down, &amp;c. Ade. Now, have you done? Mer. Just half a minute, please— This is the Theban senate-house, and these The king and senators; their business here Is to devise some means their land to clear Of the dread Sphinx. Now, then, old chap, I've done, And you've my free permission to go on. [Retires. Ade. Then we'll commence our business as before. And so, my lords and gentlemen, once more— We know our country is accursed of Juno— One of the very few things that we do know. We also understand—a rare occurrence— That this great cause of terror and abhorrence— This nuisance worse than Smithfield— Mer. Nuisance! what? Smithfield's pronounced a most salubrious spot! Ade. Really, these interruptions are most trying— [A loud scream outside. It strikes us forcibly there's some one crying. Go, some one, learn the nature of the row. [Looking off. What's this, our queen, with vexed and troubled brow? Enter Themyssis, tragically, followed by Stupidites, and weeping Attendants, in a great state of excitement. The. Howl—howl—howl—howl! oh, ye are men of stone! My child!—my boy! Ade. Speak! what's he been and done? Climbing up trees again in his best jacket? Or, no—the chimney-glass?—I knew he'd crack it! The. Alas! the fatal truth will out—it must— No more will he or you that jacket dust. His highness—(sobs) Ade. Well! don't keep us in the dark— The. “Took his accustomed airing in the park,” When—oh!—(sobs) Ade. (to Stupidites) Speak, thou slave! has he run away? Stu. No; but he's bolted, I regret to say. Ade. Bolted! How? Speak—my heart within me shrinks! Stu. Yes! bolted—swallowed—guzzled by the Sphinx! SONG—“Follow, follow, over mountain.” Stu. Swallowed, swallowed, like an oyster, By the hated Sphinx is he, And I had to cut and run, sir, Or he'd swallow, swallow me. Ade. Zounds! he'll swallow all the nation, If we don't soon put a stop To his dreadful mastication. We the fatal twig must hop. Chorus —Swallowed, swallowed, all the nation, By the monster soon will be, If we don't try emigration;— It's the only remedy. Ade. Ill-fated kinchin!—these are tidings dire: Changing a happy father to a sigher. The. But shall we thus in idle anguish howl? His goose is cook'd—we must “revenge his fowl And most unnatural murder.” Ade. True, my dear But how to do it, seems by no means clear. Force is no use; and, as for ingenuity, You know, 'mongst Thebans, that there are so few witty; That stratagem can do but little for us. Stay! where's the gent who calls himself the Chorus? [Mercury comes forward, R. Oh, there you are! I say, advise us here. Mer. Oh, Lor'! the Chorus mustn't interfere; Yet, I don't know—you've got such rueful faces, I'll tell you what is usual in such cases. Ade. We are all ears! [All listen attentively. Mer. Good long ones, I should say. Then listen: as a monarch in a play, Of course you've got a young and lovely daughter. Ade. Of course. Mer. Then advertise in ev'ry quarter Thus—“Any gent, who'll manage to deliver us From this dread monster, cruel and carnivorous, Shall wed our child, and in our stead be king— He and his heirs—” Ade. Is that the usual thing? Mer. Always, upon the stage. Ade. Then, that's the sort; We'll see to it at once—“break up the court.” SONG—Adelpates. “Here's to the Maiden of bashful,” &amp;c. Haste to the printer's, at number fifteen In the square, and of moments be thrifty; Tell him a poster at once to begin, And order two hundred and fifty. Let the bills pass 'Mongst every class, I'll promise the winner shall marry the lass. Mer. Say that, of course, she's a wonderful prize, Beauties that can't be outdone, sirs; Cheeks like a rose, and no end of bright eyes, And drawbacks and blemishes none, sirs; For ne'er was a lass, In play or in farce, Whose charms didn't all other females' surpass. Chorus —Let the bills pass, &amp;c. [Exeunt all but Mercury, L. Mer. Now, then, there'll be a pretty row, I guess, For Miss Jocasta—that's the young princess— Will think, of course, she ought to have a voice In that great matter, of a spouse the choice; And when she hears her hand's to be the prize Of any fellow who may chance—my eyes! Talk of the—! Well, now, if that really ar'n't rum— She's here, and in a most tremendous tantrum. [Enter Jocasta, L., angrily, Verenysis trying to pacify her. Ver. Nay, sister, friend, I conjure you, be cool; By all the ties of childhood and of school— By those bright days, when, side by side, we grew— The sampler stitched, and drank the pale sky-blue— When backboards made our youthful forms genteel, And stick-jaw pudding form'd the frugal meal— By our first flights at grammar and dictation— By every memory of— Joc. Botheration! You of my friendship, it would seem, are tired, Since that a coolness seems so much desir'd. I can't be cool—rage almost turns my dizzy pate. Ver. Nay, all's, perhaps, not so bad as you anticipate. Were it to save my native land from strife, Methinks I might submit to be a wife. Joc. Less patriotically I'm inclin'd; To marier pour la patrie I've no mind. SONG—“There's nae luck.” Joc. My mother bids me bind my hair With wreaths of bridal hue— To marry some one, though I've not The slightest notion who; But, ere I'll yield, the house I'll keep— I'm sure I know the way— In worse hot water than it's in Upon a washing-day. She may thump, thump—scold, scold— Storm, storm away, But about her ears I'll pull the house, And make the deuce to pay. But shall I yield in tame submission? No— I'll run away— Mer. No—will you really, though? Joc. (starting) A man! Mer. Only the Chorus, lady belle. Joc. The Chorus—oh! indeed. I hope you're well. Mer. As to my health, all doubts, at once, abolish, A chorus, generally, is tol-ol-ish. But do you really mean to run away? Joc. I do—and no mistake—this very day; (to Vere.)At least, if you my flight will take a share of. Ver. Oh! I'm agreeable— Mer. That we're all aware of. Joc. All compliments 'twere fit we should be stowing, And stand not on the order of our going, But go at once, ere Pa is on our trail. Let's book two places in the Athens Mail. Farewell! ye scenes of childhood's early sport, I leave this old ancestral Palace Court With heartfelt anguish. Mer. Oh! we do not doubt it, Few people quit the Palace Court without it. But here's your Pa—you p'rhaps had best not meet: Cut off—or he may cut off your retreat. SONG.—Mercury.—“There's a good time coming.” Here's the old chap coming, girls, The old chap's coming; (Aside, to audience.) This here tune's been over done, But it always causes fun; (To Joc. and Ver.) Here's the old chap coming! And should he catch you—you, perchance, May find that he's the stronger; (To audience, as before.) I'm forced to use that word to rhyme With “wait a little longer.” Here's the old chap coming, girls, The old chap's coming! Here's the old chap coming! don't Wait here any longer. Chorus —Here's the old chap coming.—Yes, The old chap's coming. [Exeunt Jocasta and Verenysis. Mer. Now they won't go—tho' they're so certain of it, A Chorus is a sort of Derby Prophet. Can prophecy starts, places, everything; Those girls won't start. But stay—here comes the King. [Looking off. Now I'm at fault; if I can tell you what He's after now, I wish I may be shot. But here he is—his bus'ness may transpire, In what he's going to say. Enter Adelpates. Ade. (beckoning) Young fellow! Mer. Sire. Ade. We're going to dinner in our quiet way; Come, and take pot-luck with us. What d'ye say? Mer. The chorus to neglect his post? Ade. Pooh! Pooh! The piece can spare you for a scene or two. Mer. Well, if I thought— Ade. Thought! what's the use of thinking? Mer. Well said, old fellow; let's be off like winking. [Takes his arm, and exeunt rapidly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene II. —A Landscape in Thebes. Enter Œdipus. Œd. Well, here I am, arrived on Theban ground, To see if some adventures can't be found. I'm sick of Corinth—and the stupid way In which, as Prince, I lived there, day by day. The Court—the scene of splendid dissipation, Made me, at last, quite weary of my station. The king, too, kept me down too much by far, Like Railway scrip—I was much under Pa! So, on the sly, I left his city's borders, Without awaiting his Corinthian Orders. SONG—Recitative—“Oh! Patrie.” Oh, Pa! dear, You were a great brute Pa, dear. To you I'll ne'er return, oh! Tho' to salute you, I did not tarry. Pray don't be angry that I did escape here, Provided with six shirts, two towels, And some soap, oh! as recommended By that hero—General Sir Charles Napier! Air—“Harry Bluff,” When a boy, like a muff, I was kept fast at home, Tho' to far distant lands I'd strong notions to roam; So I bolted; and now to Bœotia I'm come, To trust to my wits for a living. Air—“Schottische.” For I'd heard, these Thebans were so wooden-headed, Dull and pudden'-headed, that I could, unaided, Make my way; so, like a good un, headed Straight my course for Theban lands. Air—“Robin Adair.” So no more grief for me—sobbing or care, To keep me down, you'll see they will not dare. Now, no more care on earth, Larks—fun—and joy—and mirth, Henceforth my lot shall be;—Mocking all care. Air—“Where the bee sucks.” Merrily, merrily, shall I live now, All sorts of jollity,—all sorts of row. Well, after all my trav'ling, I have met With no excitement, no adventure yet; No highwayman has robbed me of my cash; No railway train has knocked me into smash; No lady in distress has sought my aid; No duel has called forth my bright new blade; No rows—no fights—no danger—no distress: It has been rather slow, I must confess. [Footsteps without. But hush! what's that? See crowds rush on this way, As if they had the what's-his-name to pay And no pitch hot. On—onwards—here they pace, With terror firmly rooted in each face; So firm, indeed, I may say without error, In terra firma ne'er was firmer terror. Enter Dullus, running. CONCERTED MUSIC.—Tune—“Agnes Polka. Dul. Hie away! Fly away! Here he's close behind us. If he catch us, he'll smash And to powder grind us. Enter Stupidites, running. Stu. Oh my eye! mizzle, fly! Vanish, cut, and run, sirs! Enter Sophtus, running. Sop. Oh dear, dear! he is here, Sure as any gun, sirs! Œd. Tell me now—what's the row? Like that man you're quaking, Who songs inform could not get warm— Shivering and shaking. Dul. Oh, sir! oh! such a go— Surely you have heard, sir— Stu. A thing that eats whoe'er he meets— Fact upon my word, sir. Dul. He'll meet you, greet you, task you, ask you Riddles queer; Stu. Very merry, pleasing, teasing Puns you'll hear. Dul. Yet, sir, get, sir, rather farther From his way; Stu. He'll take you, make you guess them, or Your life the forfeit pay. Enter hastily, several frightened Peasants. 1st P. Oh! dear, oh! 2nd P. Here's a go! Œd. Well, but this is rum now: Another—and another—and Another still they come now. Chorus. —Hie away! Fly away! Here he's close behind us. If he catch us, he'll smash And to powder grind us. Œd. Oh, Day and Martin! this is wondrous strange But what's it all about? Quick, sir, arrange Your scattered wits and speak. Dul. Oh, sir! Enter Mercury, hastily, R. Mer. Here, stop! If you want explanation, here's the shop. I hope that I've kept nothing waiting long— [To audience. I say, have you seen anything go wrong? Œd. Who is this monster, of such fear the source? Mer. Who? why the Sphinx—you've heard of him, of course. Œd. Oh, yes! but stop—a word 'twixt you and me— [Draws him aside. Oughtn't the Sphinx, by right, to be a she? Mer. Yes; but our authors, by poetic license, Have made a he of it. Œd. Well, come, they're nice uns. But Lor'! the ancients—this to smash will send 'em. Mer. The ancients, hang 'em!—or, at least, suspend 'em. Œd. Just as you please. (To Peasants.) I was about to swear, That be this monster rugged Russian bear, Bogy, Great Sea Serpent, or Monster Sweep, I'll rid the country of it ere I sleep. Mer. You will? Dul. (kneeling) Brave sir! and will you thus restore us? Mer. Silence, young man!—don't interrupt the Chorus. For you, brave youth, if you this deed transact,— Perform this “nuisances removal act,” The king has promised, for his country's ransom, His lovely daughter— Œd. Come! that's something handsome. I feel a glorious destiny is mine, And that my father's son's ordained to shine. Where is the monster? Mer. Well, he's just now munching Some of our happy peasantry for luncheon. [Peasants groan, and are rushing off. You needn't run—he's had this morning four of you: I don't suppose he'll care for any more of you. [Peasants groan. Œd. There now, don't groan. I've sworn to save this nation, And stop this monster's monstrous mastication. No longer shall he fright you with his powers, Nor to your peasantry pay “his devours.” Away! my heart with eagerness is beating For fame, for conquest, and a monster meeting! SONG AND CHORUS. Œd. With a helmet on my brow, And a broadsword in my hand, I'll pretty quickly show you how This monster to withstand. His claret I will shed, And sew him up quite dead; I'll thrash him, and I'll smash him, And I'll punch his caitiff head. Chorus. —With a helmet, &amp;c. &amp;c. [Peasants, &amp;c. exeunt, R. Œdipus also, is going, L., but is stopped by Mercury. Mer. Here, stop!— Œd. What, in the path of glory? Mer. Yes. Œd. What for, pray? Mer. Lovely woman in distress. You know when sorrow's chains weigh down and fetter her, “The man who would refuse to aid,” et cetera. Œd. Of course. Mer. Then on those ladies turn your sight. [Pointing off, R. Œdipus starts with admiration. Œd. Good gracious! Œdipus, you're done for quite. Mer. Smitten? Œd. Decidedly—as deep as could be. Mer. Quite right—the plot requires that you should be. Œd. All the Greek fire of my Corinthian nature Is kindled by one glance at that fair creature. Enter Jocasta and Verenysis, with parasols and a bandbox. They are crossing. Œd. (energetically) Stay, Madam! Joc. (startled) Goodness gracious! how you've shaken one. Œd. Don't move another step until I've taken one. [Kneels to her. Joc. Sir! Œd. Nay! excuse my hasty way of showing it, But I adore you— Mer. Isn't he a-going it? Just allow me—you'll get on all the faster. [Introducing them. Corinthian Œdipus.—Princess Jocasta. Œd. The Prize One? Mer. Yes. Œd. Then by the light of day, By all the glories of the milky way— By Saturn—Mars—and all the other don stars. If every monster, in six thousand monsters, Were in six parts—and every part Old Scratch, I'd thrash them all, to win so great a catch! Joc. Brave youth!—A sense of filial duty strong, Seizes upon me. Yes, its very wrong To leave one's home (to Verenysis). On second thoughts, we'll stay. I couldn't think of dragging you away From home and friends. So if you'll just step back With these few things, I'll follow in a crack. Ver. Methinks I see which way the mouser jumps. Mer. (aside to Verenysis) Of course—they want us both to stir our stumps. A love-scene's coming, and in such, you know, E'en friends and choruses are thought de trop. CONCERTED MUSIC.—Air.—“Coal black Rose.” Mer. Lovely, rosy damsel, come! Don't you see they're looking at us glum! glum! glum! Ver. I'm awake sir.—Yes, I come. (to Jocasta) Trust a friend for secresy.—I'm dumb! dumb! dumb! Both. Oh beaux! nice young beaux! How you turn the women's heads, you nice young beaux! Joc. Just go ahead a little—there's a dear! Mer. We'll get out of hearing, Ma'am; you needn't fear. Œd. Do oblige us, and we'll come, Soon to follow arter, singing tum-tum-tum. Oh beaux, &amp;c., &amp;c. [Mercury offers his arm to Verenysis; she takes it, and they exeunt. Œd. Now then. Of course my duty, you're aware, Is first to kneel—(kneels)—That's done: and now to swear— Joc. Lor', sir, please don't!— Œd. Sweet plant from Nature's nursery! Pray of my words don't take a view so cursory. I'll swear to love you, till all nature thro' Assumes one universal azure hue; Which speech, translated, means, till all is blue; That is, if you loves me as I loves you. Joc. I does— Œd. You does? Joc. I does, a dozen times. Œd. Oh, happy was the day I sought these climes! Duet.—“Love was once a little boy.” Œd. I love you more than little boys Joc. Heigho! Heigho! Œd. Love tops, hardbake, cakes, or toys, Joc. Heigho! Heigho! Œd. If to have me you're content— I'm on matrimony bent— 'Pon the honor of a gent! Joc. Heigho! Heigho! Lady's hearts you can trepan, Œd. Heigho! Heigho! Joc. Like the braw John Highlandman. Œd. Heigho! Heigho! Joc. Here in Thebes, we know no art,— So I own you've boned my heart. So to buy the ring let's start. Œd. Heigho! Heigho! But I and this companion blade of metal, [Showing his sword. The peasant-eating settler first must settle, And then to settle down in life with you. Joc. Suppose you settle down in death, though? Œd. True! But then for you to lose my life right happy should I be. Joc. Though I'm proud to think of that, what will become of me? Œd. Nay, do not fear, my life I can defend. Joc. Bother the monster! Œd. That's what I intend, And then to claim you for my prize, and wife! Joc. But to do that you needn't risk your life— That can be done at once. Œd. What sweet rusticity! Fair sample of Bœotia's pure simplicity! But no; I've sworn to slay this nasty beast; Honour, you know! Joc. Then take some help, at least. Œd. Egad! your words suggest a fine idea. I'll tell you what—I'll rouse the natives here, Make speeches to them, and, through agitation, The monster smash by a de-monster-ation. Why shouldn't I, like many fam'd in story, Make others fight, and pocket all the glory? SONG—Œdipus. “Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me.” I've come from fair Corinthia, by the borders of the sea, Where rather deep and downyish the folks are thought to be; I've studied pretty deeply how to mind my weather eye In all I undertake; and so, Jocasta, don't you cry. Oh, Jocasta, Don't you cry for me; I'm going to cook the monster's goose, Your country for to free. This monster lives a long way off—a few doors down the street; The electric telegraph shall tell you when with him I meet: I'll take him to the Egyptian Hall, great crowds will thither hie— One fool, you know, makes many; so, Jocasta, don't you cry, Oh, Jocasta, &amp;c. [Exeunt, R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene III. —The exterior of “Nuts-to-Crack” Lodge. The Sphinx's dwelling; gates and shrubbery in the modern villa style. Sphinx discovered reclining on a pedestal, C., in the attitude of the Egyptian statues, his face towards the audience. Sph. So—“after dinner, sit awhile,” they say, And as the dinner-things are cleared away, Here I'll enjoy my otium in the sun— That roasted shepherdess was scarcely done; Those scraggy peasants wern't a bite a-piece— It's very odd they can't get fat in Greece. No matter, quantity makes up for quality, And, altogether, mine's a life of jollity. These Thebans are such dolts—so easy caught— Each single riddle has a dinner brought, Quick as the wand of any necromancer: In point of fact, I find my questions answer. SONG.—Tune—“Ri fum ti fum.” Here in good luck I'm basking, And these dull Thebans tasking, For, like Billy Black, I never lack, Conundrums to be asking. They give 'em up—they give 'em up. (Spoken.)Such as this:—Why does a miller wear a white hat? eh? D'ye give it up? To be sure they do; then I, Fight 'em—bite 'em; beat 'em—eat 'em, Right too looral ido. These Thebans are such fools, sirs, As you've all read at schools, sirs, It's sad, though true, they cannot do A long division rule, sirs. But give it up—yes, give it up. (Spoken.)I've tried them so—If a herring and a half cost three halfpence, how many can you get for a shilling? D'ye give it up? Yes; oh, yes. So, then, I, of course, as it's very proper I should, Fight 'em—bite 'em; beat 'em—eat 'em. Right too looral ido. But soft! Fe! Fi! Fo! Fum! you all know that In ogre's language means—I smell a rat. Somebody's coming! so, now, I'll be quick with them; They'll soon find out that I've a bone to pick with them. [Exit, L. Enter Mercury. Mer. There goes again! I do believe he kills More folks each day than any patent pills. Yes!—there he's got 'em—oh, the greedy sinner! Two more poor peasants for to-morrow's dinner. Re-enter Sphinx, dragging in Dullus and Noïdeas. Dul. Dread monster, spare us! Sph. Caitiffs, not before You've told me when a door is not a door? Noï. Oh, mercy, mercy! Sph. Well, then, please to state— What makes more noise than one pig in a gate? Or, if you would prefer it, tell me soon— How many cows' talls would reach to the moon? Noï. I've no idea! Sph. Of course you never had. Dul. I can't imagine! Sph. No; don't try, my lad. But come, d'ye give it up? Noï. Yes. Sph. Ah! that's right! You'll just be nice at supper-time to-night. [Pinching them. I think you're fat enough to roast; and you Will do to boil in onions, for a stew. Dul. Oh, spare us—let us go! Sph. I'll tell you what— I will let you go—that is, go to pot; Your friend I've said I'll roast—come, there I've nicked him. Mer. You horrid glutton! Sph. (aside) Ha! another victim! (to Mer.) Excuse me, sir; but may I trouble you To tell me what's most like a horse's shoe? [Mercury laughs at him. Pray, who are you, my pow'r thus disregarding? Mer. Why, I'm the Chorus— Sph. Oh! I beg your parding. Mer. There—go on, don't mind me. Sph. You're very kind. Pris'ners, you stand convicted here, I find, Of want of brains. What have you got to say Against being eaten in the usual way? SONG.—Tune—“It will nebber do to gib it up so.” Sph. What can you say, my precious swell? Dul. Indeed, sir, that is more than I can tell. Sph. Oh, very good, sir. What say you? Noï. Well, I'm afraid I must give it up too. Mer. Oh! 'twill never do to give it up so. It will never do to give it up so. It will never do to give it up so. No! no! no! Cho. It will never do, &amp;c. [Sphinx drives Dullus and Noïdeas before him into the house. Mer. That's how the population's thinn'd, you see; And p'r'aps you'll say, that thinn'd it wants to be, The folks being all so thick.—Well, half the nation Have made their minds up to try emigration, And go to Cali—oh no—I forget, For California's not discovered yet. SONG.—Tune, “The Irish Washerwoman.” Oh, the time's not come yet when those arts and those sciences Furnish proud man with all means and appliances Nature's resources to seize for himself, And to make every element add to his pelf. Famed California hasn't been thought about; Railways and steam-engines haven't been brought about; Gun-cotton, printing, a prison for debt, And electrical lights, are not dreamt about yet. This is the period of gods and of goddesses, Which you've all read of in Illiads and Odysseys; When in Arcadia the shepherds are seen, And like chimney-sweeps live each man-Jack in the Green. This is the period of which Ovid offers his Views and opinions in his Metamorphoses. Facts I just mention your minds to direct, For our piece is as classical as it's correct. The Thebans are now little better than savages, So that the Sphinx all their country now ravages: With all his questions they're readily caught— For as yet, we know, joking they haven't been taught; Riddles arn't printed now with answers under 'em; No “Boys' own Book” to explain a conundrum; No comic writers—no songs at Vauxhall— No plays—no burlesques—nor no nothing at all. Stop, though, I ought to tell you, by the bye, The King is going, too, upon the sly. Mind, that's a secret, for the Queen don't know it; Though when she hears—but there, the piece will show it. It's near the time these fellows meant to go. [Looks at his watch. Just to a minute. [Music.—Scene changes to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene IV. —A Sea-port view. Galleys in the distance. Several Thebans, men, women, and children with luggage, bundles, &amp;c., discovered. Mer. There,—I told you so. These are the folks who'd quit their native valleys; And then, just out beyond the buoy, the gallies In which they sail—stop (to the conductor of orchestra) by the bye, old fellow, The boatman's chorus in “Masaniello.” CONCERTED MUSIC.—“The Barcarole.” Mer. Behold! from their last places warning, What lots of folks to give are forced, To sea unused, but sickness scorning, They'll dare the breeze, and brave the worst. Cut off, cut off, 'tis time to go, Take heed—whisper low! Look out for squalls—the Sphinx is near, Take heed—whisper low! The prey he seeks, he'll soon, he'll soon ensnare, The prey he seeks, he'll soon, he'll soon ensnare. Take heed—whisper low—take heed—whisper low! Cho. Cut off, cut off, I told you so. Take heed—whisper low, Look out for squalls, the Sphinx is near, Take heed—whisper low! The prey he seeks, &amp;c. [Emigrants exeunt after Song. Mer. Oh, now his majesty's arrived, I see, In hackney chariot, seventeen-five-three; And, from his angry gestures, 'twould appear, The fare's disputed by the charioteer. Well, I shall leave them to it—au revoir. [Exit, L. Enter Adelpates in travelling costume, with carpet bag, and Cochos, L. Ade. I say your fare's an obolus—no more. Coc. Vell, say another chalcus.— Ade. (giving money) Peace—you'd best. Summons me if you like. Coc. Oh! that be blest. [Exit, L. Ade. “It is the cause! it is the cause!” 'cause why? 'Cause Nature's first great law, is “mind your eye!” Yet shall they say that I, a poor poltroon, In times of danger, basely shot the moon! Shall I my country fly, when ills beset her, Fearing to die for her? Yes, p'rhaps I'd better. Enter Stupidites cautiously. Stu. Your majesty. Ade. (starts) Who's there? Stu. 'Tis only I. Don't start,—yet do start, for it's time to fly: All is prepared. Ade. Then farewell fear, and care, too, Sphinx, wife, and all the ills that flesh is heir to. You'll answer all inquiries at the palace, Nothing extenuate—set down naught in malice. Say, Fortune's frolics drove me hence to range, That Fortune for your sovereign brought this change! That 'twas her fickle turnings struck this blow, And Fortune's wheel that brought mis-fortune's woe! As for the Queen—(looks off, and starts frightened) Ye gods! she's here. I'm caught! Enter Themyssis and Two Maids of Honour, L. The. So, sir, to give your wife the slip you thought, But I can hunt the slipper— Ade. No, my dear, You do mistake. The. Then what's your bus'ness here? TRIO—“Why are you wandering here?” The. Why are you wandering here, I pray? Will you be kind enough just to say? Ade. I go to the senate, love, to debate, On business, and weighty affairs of state. The. Fie! Fie! That's all my eye! The house has adjourned, full well you know, On the motion of Brotherton—hours ago. Stu. Hours ago! Ade. You don't say so? The. (Together.) Ri-tol-de-riddle ol—hours ago! Ade. &amp; Stu. (Together.) Ri-tol-de-riddle ol—here's ago! The. You would have left me; yes, you monster bearish! Me and my children, burdens on the parish. Ade. Parish the thought! I wouldn't— The. Don't deceive me, That bag declares the sack you meant to give me. That Templar Night Cap, points your vile intent out. Sphinx. (outside) Hoy! Where was Moses when the candle went out? Ade. That voice! Stu. That question! Ade. Horror! 'tis the Sphinx! [Adelpates and Stupidites hide themselves. Themyssis is rushing off, but is met by the Sphinx entering. Sph. (bowing) Good evening, ma'am—the Queen of Thebes, methinks. The. Monster! away! be off! get out! hish, hoo! [Waving her hands as people frighten fowls. Sph. Well, really, ma'am, I'm quite surprised at you. 'Tis my desire to do the civil thing, So just say, why a cobbler's like a king? The. Help! murder! Adelpates, save your wife! [Adelpates peeps out from his hiding-place. Sph. Hilloa! his majesty, upon my life. Great Adelpates! [Takes him by his cloak; Adelpates utters a loud cry and runs away, leaving his cloak; Sphinx follows him, and cries after him at the wing. Hoy! hilloa there; stop, Just say, what smells most in a doctor's shop? The. Help! Murder! Stu. Help! Sph. What ho! a rat, a rat! Dead for a ducat. [Rushes upon him. Stu. Oh! what am I at? I am lost! Sph. I beg your pardon, sir, you're found, And will be taken care of, I'll be bound. [The Sphinx seizes them each by the arm. They scream, and writhe as if in agony. The. Monster! you've nearly twisted off my wrist. Sph. Of course—I'm celebrated for my twist. In my strong arm the powers you will find Of Seizer and A-gripper both combined. Stu. Monster! release us; dare not thus to stop us— We claim protection by the Habeas Coppus. Sph. Pooh, pooh! don't talk to me about your laws: What act of parliament can withstand my claws? They with the strongest bills or beaks would match, And even Railway Kings bring to the scratch. Come— The. Murder! Sph. Gammon! Come, this uproar cease. The. Help! Stu. Murder! The. Fire! Stu. Thieves! The. Police! Both. Police! [Music.—Sphinx drags them melodramatically across the stage, and exeunt, R. Enter Mercury, L. Mer. Well there, that's settled. Now then, you shall see How Œdipus has raised a company Of tag-rag, bob-tail, peasants, shepherds, fishermen, The whole of whom he's sworn in as militia-men, To fight the Sphinx; while, if he'd asked the oracle, He would have learned a fact that's now historical. That none this monster's ravages can stop, Unless he guess some question he may pop: For, tho' at force of arms he turns his nose up, One riddle guessed, the Sphinx completely sews up. But see, the king returns—the coast being clear Of both the dreadful causes of his fear. Re-enter Adelpates, cautiously, R. Ade. The monster's carried off my wife in haste. Well, I can't compliment him on his taste, To take her home to dinner or to tea with him;— One thing I'm certain of, she won't agree with him: She ne'er agreed with any that I knew. [Mercury taps him on the shoulder. He falls on his knees, frightened. Be off; I'm not at home—(sees him)—What, is it you? Mer. Don't speak, but watch. Ade. I do not comprehend you. Mer. Then open your eyes and shut your mouth, and see what fate will send you. [Music.—Enter Œdipus, with a crowd of peasants armed with scythes, pitchforks, rakes, &amp;c., L. Œd. Halt! Shoulder arms! Attention! Stand at ease! Order arms!— Mer. Here, just wait a moment, please: I fancy here that I can be of use to you— Allow me, pray, the king to introduce to you— Œdipus—Adelpates. Now, good bye— Œd. Here—stop— Mer. I can't—I've other fish to fry. [Exit, L. Ade. And now, young man, what means this demonstration? Œd. Fear not, great king, by peaceful agitation It has been raised: for know I always do shun all Means that are not strictly constitutional. SONG.—Air—“The Death of Nelson.” 'Twas in Trafalgar-square (You've seen the fountains there), This morn, at half-past ten, I a meeting did convoke: For half an hour I spoke Unto these gentlemen. I roused their pluck, and made them brave; Three cheers the gallant Thebans gave, And thought my speech a beauty. To fight the Sphinx then off we ran; And I expect that ev'ry man This day will do his duty. Ade. Brave youth! we thank you for the pains you've taken To save our common weal and royal bacon; For, though a late act of this vile monstrosity Has mitigated much the animosity We felt towards him—still, he must not live! Œd. Fear not, he shan't—I'll him his gruel give. Ade. Go in and win! The prize you understand— Œd. The victor's palm, and the princess's hand— A prize the greatest, dearest boon in life— “The young man's best companion”—a fair wife. Ade. (aside) Poor youth! he'd better be devoured far, If the dear girl takes after her mamma. Œd. But come, let's on—nor longer here delay; You'll come and share our glory? Ade. Not to-day. My share of glory I'll consent to shelf; And, while you hide the Sphinx, I'll hide myself. Œd. No hiding-place will screen you from his eye, Though darker than the Vernon Gallery. But come, old fellow, throw off this dejection, And trust my “country party” for protection. DUET—“O, dolce Concento.” Œd. Oh, don't be dull, old gent, oh! But come with me away; You'd better far consent, oh! For it is n't safe to stay. Ade. Oh! dear— Œd. Oh, you'd better come, old gent, oh! Ade. No, I won't Œd. Come, I'll your champion be— Ade. Good lad! Œd. You'd better far consent, oh! Ade. Well, p'r'aps I had; But then p'r'aps not. Eh—no—yes! Oh, dear, oh! Œd. And so, sir, come along with me. Oh, don't fear, old gent, oh! Ade. Oh, dear!—I won't. Œd. Courageous please to be. Ade. Of course. I'm just now-getting so. Œd. So come, it's time we went, oh! And don't say no, but come with me. Ade. No, I won't say so, but go with he. Ade. (aside) Yes, second thoughts are best. I freely own I should not like to meet the Sphinx alone: I'll go with them; for, even to the worst, The chaps in front will get demolish'd first, And give me time to cut. (Aloud) Yes, come, my friends, Your King the call of glory thus attends! [Crosses to R. Œd. Then now no longer shall this monster teaze ye— Henceforth your land shall be both free and easy. Ade. Brave youth! come, friends, your gratitude to show, Three cheers for Œdipus before you go! [Peasants shout. Ade. &amp; Cho. For he's a jolly good fellow, For he's a jolly good fellow, Which nobody can deny. [Exeunt, marching out to music.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene V. —A Landscape. Enter Sphinx, L. Sph. The Queen and friend are safely under lock, And I've laid in a tidy winter stock. Pleasing reflections! I begin to find The blessings of a thoughtful, frugal mind. But soft! here comes a pretty girl—somehow, I don't feel much inclin'd for sport just now. Stay—a thought strikes me;—yes, a grand, sublime one— 'Tis this: I'll fall in love—ain't it a prime one? Though, classically speaking, I expect My doing so won't be at all correct. But mere historical considerations Shan't stand between me and my inclinations. Enter Jocasta, sentimentally, R. Joc. Though I'm in Greece, I'm much inclin'd to roam; Methinks I've wander'd rather far from home. My harass'd mind refus'd to let me sit At home—to read, to practise, or to knit; In vain my frame of Berlin wool I took, Nor could I crochet do, by hook or crook; So out I wander'd, 'mongst the fields and dells, My thoughts meanwhile all wandering somewhere else: I'd no idea my walk was half so long— An observation which suggests a song. SONG.—“On the Margin of fair Zurich's Waters.” I've been marching about in all quarters— Variety Or amusement in hopes I should find; For just now fair Bœotia's fair daughters' Society Doesn't answer the state of my mind. I'm in love, as you plainly may see; And the best thing for that's known to be Fresh amusements, fresh scenes, and fresh air— Variety! For 'tis thus all the doctors declare. Variety—variety is sure to succeed; Variety—variety is all that I need. But I fear I've walk'd rather too far; Propriety Demands that I now should go home; For by this I have caused poor papa Anxiety, As I'm not much accustom'd to roam; For the gov'nor, no doubt, surely thinks That I have been pick'd up by the Sphinx; For this monster, too well it is known, Notoriety! Will never leave young girls alone. Impropriety—notoriety! Oh, dear! I shall die! With anxiety; so propriety demands I should fly. [During her song the Sphinx listens with great admiration. Sph. Whene'er I say I'll do a thing, it's done. I am in love. Young woman— [Jocasta screams, and is running away. Sphinx stops her. Stop, don't run— Sweet Syren, sing once more that strain so clear— Yes,—let that air again delight this ear. Joc. Tho' nothing desperate I mean to do, A frightful object I have now in view. What are you—speak? Sph. I bear a name of dread, That's used to frighten naughty boys to bed; I'm he from whom the stoutest Theban shrinks, He—the devouring element—the Sphinx. Joc. Then all is lost. Sph. Not so—I'm going to make A handsome offer, which I'm sure you'll take. D'ye feel inclin'd me for a spouse to try? Many have husbands greater brutes than I. Spite of my wings and tails, whose looks may fright ye, I'm not a scaly sort of chap, nor flighty. Naught shall you fear, with my protecting clause, So rush into my arms—or rather paws— Joc. Paws off! Sph. Pause, ere with such contempt you treat me,— Joc. Monster! you've roasted me enough—so eat me. Prolong not my hard fate with such vile flummery, But with “one swallow” please to make it summer-y. Sph. Rash girl! then have your wish, the twig to hop I'll not propose, but I'll the question pop; Why is?—no, when is?— Joc. Help! help! Ah, they're here. Sph. Are they? then I'll retire, for I fear That what with blighted love and indigestion, I couldn't now propose a single question. [Jocasta screams and faints, Sphinx drags her off, L. Enter Œdipus, Adelpates supported between Ignoramos and Scylleon, Peasants, &amp;c., R. Œd. What means that scream—that cry of wild distress? Enter Mercury quickly, L. Mer. The Sphinx has bolted with the young princess. Œd. Unsay your words. Mer. Can't; 'pon my life he's caught her. Œd. My love, my bride— Ade. My daughter—oh, my daughter! Œd. Forward! Attack this monster on the spot. Quick march!— Ade. Indeed, young man, I'd rather not. It's hard enough to lose one's daughter; yet I'd rather The Sphinx eat her than eat that daughter's father. Œd. Nay, haste; we'll yet avert this fell disaster; Forward! our watchword—Freedom and Jocasta. Music.—Œdipus and Followers march out. Adelpates hanging back, but dragged on by Ignoramos, and Scylleon. Mer. Well, now, this scene has bothered me most sadly; In fact, the authors treat me very badly. As Chorus, by all means, I should have heard of it, But till this moment I knew not a word of it; Nor can I find the story any where. It isn't hinted at by Lemprière. The Sphinx in love! I s'pose it's all correct, Though really it's what I did not expect. And yet no doubt the Sphinx is like the rest of us— A pretty woman will upset the best of us. But stay, with this affair I'm so perplexed, I've not the faintest notion what comes next. For information, therefore, don't ask me, But I suppose you'll see what you shall see. But I'm annoyed at such atrocious dealings— Here, music!—just to calm my ruffled feelings. SONG.—Tune.—“I likes a drop of good beer.” I could kick up a din— Such a passion I'm in, It makes me feel very queer; For it's just nothing but A most desperate cut, Which I havn't deserved, that's clear. For the likes of such as this here, For the likes of such as this here, Is as far from right, And as blameable quite, As to rob a poor man of his beer. [Exit, L.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene IV. —The Sphinx's larder. Themyssis, Dullus, Stupidites, Noïdeas, Sophtus, Peasants, &amp;c., discovered tied to rocks. Jars labelled, “Potted Thebans,” “Preserved Senators,” “Pickled Soldiers,” &amp;c. Jocasta as just brought in. The Sphinx standing by. Sph. Now for a grand battue; I've asked a problem, Which they can't solve—so up at once I'll gobble 'em. Dolts, Thebans, loggerheads, and lubbers, hear me! If you the mystery I've proposed can clear me, I'll make you free—almost as free—nay quite, As have our authors made with me to-night. D'ye give it up?—Halloa! what's that! I heard steps? Yes, there are footsteps coming down the yard steps. Joc. Joy! we're preserved! Sph. You soon will be, my dears; Pickled, at least—can I believe my ears? [Listening. The. Succour's at hand! oh, with delight I jump! Sph. Sucker! pooh! nonsense! who'd be such a pump? Enter Œdipus with his sword drawn. Joc. (runs up and embraces him.) My Œdipus! Œd. My bride—my future missis! Not eaten! I'll devour you with kisses. Sph. Young man, you've lost your wits—though, by the bye, If you're a Theban gent, that won't apply. Still it's extremely kind of you to call. You'll stay to supper. Œd. Monster! not at all. Another supper you shall ne'er di-gest; Prepare to die just now— [Makes a movement to stab him. Sph. My bold young guest, Are you aware, ere you this form can run through, That certain other forms must first be gone through; That Juno set me up in business here— License, good-will, and all expences clear. With power to eat such of the population, As of my riddles can't give explanation. Œd. Riddles! pooh! pooh! I'll give you leave to guzzle me, If you've a riddle hard enough to puzzle me. No Theban I,—in Corinth was I grown, Where the great Joseph Miller's works are known. Know that my vivid intellects are able, To solve the meaning of a Railway table. My mind feels equal—yes, I vow it does, To read a page of the Fonetic Nuz! Sph. Egad! if that's the case, I must prepare For a great mental effort. Now, beware! Thus, certain doom I launch upon thy head— Rash boy—say, why do we all go to bed? D'ye give it up? Œd. No! I expound it thus— It is—because the bed won't come to us! [Music.—A crash. The walls fall down, and every vestige of the Sphinx's dwelling disappears, showing an extensive view of the country; all the armed Thebans, Adelpates, Women, Children, &amp;c. grouped. Jocasta and Œdipus embrace—also Adelpates and Themyssis. All shout. Sph. My spell is broken! Matter's floored by mind, Though matter of a questionable kind. My doom to classic students now is known, I've got to dash my brains out 'gainst a stone! Let's see if I a decent one can hit upon, Yes, that appears a goodish rock to split upon. Now, clear the way there. One! two! three! [The people fall back. Sphinx makes a run at the rock, head first; Mercury runs briskly in and stops him. Mer. Stand back! Remember, that a head's no joke to crack! I shan't allow it. Sph. What! my worthy Chorus, Fly in the faces of Apollodorus, Hesiod, and many another ancient buffer! Mer. Pooh! pooh! they've got no friends, so let them suffer. Our authors seeing now what's all the go Are red republicans, or nearly so; Of stern correctness trampling on the border, They run wild riot o'er established order, Defying all the recognised authorities. Œd. No, that's not true, I'm sure. Mer. Egad, no more it is. No—to one sovereign power still they bow, And throw themselves upon its mercy now. To them—your subjects,—pray kind treatment show. Whether their subject's treated well or no. FINALE. Tune—“Sure such a day.” Œd. Oh, what a row, what a rumpus, and a rioting, In every seat, from hands and feet, I'd like to hear. Do, if you please, then, our authors' fears all quieting, On us bestow, before you go, a parting cheer. Tune—“Olga Waltz.” Joc. Then all ill-nature scorning, Let smiles your lips adorning, Be now and in the morning, When daylight doth appear. Tune—“Rataplan.” Mer. That's the plan—that's the plan—that's the plan, plan, plan, plan, plan, Now for you, to pursue, Just so—and we know— Without joke, you're the folks who can— Sph. (spoken) Stop, young man!— Tune—“Cease, rude Boreas.” Cease good chorus, bustling prater, List ye landsmen all to me, One more question—s' help me tater— Answer'd yet remains to be.— (Spoken, to audience)It's only one, but it's an important one; I've asked everybody else questions, now let me ask you one— 'tis this: Is this piece to succeed, or—d'ye give it up? CHORUS. Tune—“Ibrahim Pacha Quadrille.” The Sphinx is overthrown; Our country's woes are o'er; With you it rests alone To bid him live once more. Your smiles will give him ease, And fill with joy his cup: Then say his riddles please, Nor bid us give them up. [Mercury drags the Sphinx to a block of stone, C., and places him in the same attitude as that in which he was first discovered. A globe rises on the stone, upon which Mercury stands over the Sphinx in the attitude of Canova's statue. The peasants group around, and the curtain falls.</field>
