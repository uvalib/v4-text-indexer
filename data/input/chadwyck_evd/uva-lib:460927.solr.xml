      <field name="fulltext">Chorus, entering the stage in procession. March time. Jove, the suppliant's high protector, Look from Heaven, benignly favouring Us the suppliant band, swift-oared Hither sailing, from the seven mouths Of the fat fine-sanded Nile! From the land that fringes Syria, Land divine, in flight we came, Not by public vote forth-driven, Not by taint of blood divorced From our native state, but chastely Our abhorrent foot withdrawing From impure ungodly wedlock With Ægyptus' sons, too nearly Cousined with ourselves. For wisely, This our threatened harm well-weighing, Danaus, our sire, prime counsellor, And leader of our sistered band, Timely chose this least of sorrows O'er the salt-sea wave to flee; And here on Argive soil to plant us, Whence our race its vaunted spring Drew divinely, when great Jove Gently thrilled the brize-stung heifer With his procreant touch, and breathed Godlike virtue on her womb. Where on Earth should we hope refuge On more friendly ground than this, In our hands these green boughs bearing Wreathed with precatory wool? Ye blissful gods supremely swaying Land and city, and lucid streams; And ye in sepulchres dark, severely Worshipped 'neath the sunless ground; And thou, the third, great Jove the Saviour, Guardian of all holy homes, With your spirit gracious-wafted, Breathe fair welcome on this band Of suppliant maids. But in the depth Of whirling waves engulph the swarm Of insolent youths, Ægyptus' sons, Them, and their sea-cars swiftly oared, Ere this slimy shore receive Their hated footprint. Let them labour, With wrath-spitting seas confronted: By the wild storm wintry-beating, Thunder-crashing, lightning flashing, By the tyrannous blast shower-laden Let them perish, ere they mount Marriage beds which right refuses, Us, their father's brother's daughters To their lawless yoke enthralling! The Chorus assemble in a band round the centre of the Orchestra, and sing the Choral Hymn. STROPHE I. Give ear to our prayer, we implore thee, Thou son, and the mother that bore thee— The calf and the heifer divine! From afar be thine offspring's avenger, Even thou, once a beautiful ranger O'er these meads with the grass-cropping kine! And thou, whom she bore to her honour, When the breath of the Highest was on her, And the touch of the finger divine; Thine ear, mighty god, we implore thee To the prayer of thine offspring incline! ANTISTROPHE I. O Thou who with blessing anointed, Wert born when by Fate 'twas appointed, With thy name to all ages a sign! In this land of the mother that bore thee, Her toils we remember before thee, Where she cropped the green mead with the kine. O strange were her fortunes, and stranger The fate that hath chased me from danger To the home of the heifer divine. O son, with the mother that bore thee, Stamp my tale with thy truth for a sign! STROPHE AND ANTISTROPHE II. While we cry, should there haply be near us An Argive, an augur, to hear us, When our shrill-piercing wail His ear shall assail, 'Tis the cry he will deem, and none other, Of Procne, the woe-wedded mother, The hawk-hunted nightingale; Sad bird, when its known streams it leaveth, And with fresh-bleeding grief lonely grieveth, And telleth the tale, With a shrill-voiced wail, How the son that she loved, and none other, Was slain by his fell-purposed mother, The woe-wedded nightingale! STROPHE III. Even so from the Nile summer-tinted, With Ionian wailings unstinted, My cheek with the keen nail I tear; And I pluck, where it bloweth, Grief's blossom that groweth In this heart first acquainted with care; And I fear the fierce band, From the far misty land, Whom the swift ships to Argos may bear. ANTISTROPHE III. Ye gods of my race, seeing clearly The right which ye cherish so dearly, To the haughty your hatred declare! 'Gainst the right ye will never Chaste virgins deliver, The bed of the lawless to share; From the god-fenced altar Each awe-struck assaulter Back shrinks. Our sure bulwark is there. STROPHE IV. O would that Jove might show to men His counsel as he planned it; But ah! he darkly weaves the scheme, No mortal eye hath scanned it. It burns through darkness brightly clear To whom the god shall show it; But mortal man, through cloudy fear, Shall search in vain to know it. ANTISTROPHE IV. Firm to the goal his purpose treads, His will knows no frustration; When with his brow the mighty god Hath nodded consummation. But strangely, strangely weave their maze His counsels, dusky wending, Concealed in densely-tangled ways From human comprehending. STROPHE V. From their high-towering hopes the proud In wretched rout he casteth. No force he wields; his simple will, His quiet sentence blasteth. All godlike power is calm; and high On thrones of glory seated, Jove looks from Heaven with tranquil eye, And sees his will completed. ANTISTROPHE V. Look down, O mighty god, and see How, this harsh wedlock planning, That dry old tree in saplings green, The insolent lust is fanning! Madly he hugs the frenzied plan With perverse heart unbending, Hot-spurred, till Ruin seize the man, Too late to think of mending. STROPHE VI. Ah! well-a-day! ah! well-a-day! Thus sadly I hymn the sorrowful lay, With a shrill-voiced cry, With a sorrow-streaming eye, Well-a-day, woe's me! Thus I grace my own tomb with the wail pouring free, Thus I sing my own dirge, ah me! Ye Apian hills, be kind to me, And throw not back the stranger's note, But know the Libyan wail. Behold how, rent to sorrow's note, My linen robes all loosely float, And my Sidonian veil. ANTISTROPHE VI. Ah! well-a-day! ah! well-a-day! My plighted vows I'll duly pay, Ye gods, if ye will save From the foe, and from the grave My trembling life set free! Surges high, surges high, sorrow's many-billowed sea, And woe towers on woe. Ah me! Ye Apian hills, be kind to me, And throw not back the stranger's note But know the Libyan wail! Behold how, rent to sorrow's note, My linen robes all loosely float, And my Sidonian veil! STROPHE VII. And yet, in that slight timbered house, well-armed With frequent-plashing oar, Stiff sail and cordage straining, all unharmed By winter's stormy roar, We reached this Argive shore. Safely so far. May Jove, the all-seeing, send As the beginning, so the prosperous end. And may he grant, indeed, That we, a gracious mother's gracious seed, By no harsh kindred wooed, May live on Apian ground unyoked and unsubdued! ANTISTROPHE VII. May she, the virgin daughter of high Jove, Our virgin litany hear, Our loving homage answering with more love! She that, with face severe, Repelled, in awful fear, Each rude aggressor, in firm virtue cased, Nor knew the lustful touch divinely chaste. And may she grant, indeed, That we, a gracious mother's gracious seed, By no harsh kindred wooed, May live on Apian ground unyoked and unsubdued. STROPHE VIII. But if no aid to us may be, Libya's swart sun-beaten daughters, The rope shall end our toils; and we, Beneath the ground, shall fare to thee, Thou many-guested Jove, To thee our suppliant boughs we'll spread, Thou Saviour of the weary Dead, Far from the shining thrones of blissful gods above. Ah, Jove too well we know What wrath divine scourged ancient Io, wailing Beneath thy consort's anger heaven-scaling; And even so, On Io's seed may blow, A buffeting blast from her of black despairful woe! ANTISTROPHE VIII. O Jove, how then wilt thou be free From just reproach of Libya's daughters, If thou in us dishonored see Him whom the heifer bore to thee Whom thou didst chiefly love. If thou from us shalt turn thy face, What suppliant then shall seek thy grace? O hear my prayer enthroned in loftiest state above! For well, too well, we know What wrath divine scourged ancient Io, wailing Beneath thy consort's anger heaven-scaling; And even so On Io's seed may blow A buffeting blast from her of black despairful woe. Enter DANAUS. Be wise, my daughters. In no rash flight with me, A hoary father, and a faithful pilot, Ye crossed the seas; nor less is wisdom needful Ashore: be wise, and on your heart's true tablet Engrave my words. For lo! where mounts the dust A voiceless herald of their coming; hear Their distant-rumbling wheels! A host I see Of bright shield-bearing and spear-shaking men, Swift steeds, and rounded cars. Of our here landing, Timely apprised, the chiefs that rule this country Come with their eyes to read us. But be their coming Harmless, or harsh with fell displeasure, here On this high-seat of the Agonian gods Is safety for my daughters; for an altar Is a sure tower of strength, a shield that bears The rattling terror dintless. Go ye, therefore, Embrace these altars, in your sistered hands These white-wreathed precatory boughs presenting, Which awful Jove reveres; and with choice phrase Wisely your pity-moving tale commend When they shall ask you; as becomes the stranger, The bloodless motive of your flight declaring With clear recital. The bold tongue eschewing With sober-fronted face and quiet eye Your tale unfold. The garrulous prate, the length Of slow-drawn speech beware. Such fault offends This people sorely. Chiefly know to yield: Thou art the weaker—a poor helpless stranger— The bold-mouthed phrase suits ill with thy condition. CHORUS. Father, thou speakest wisely: nor unwisely Thy words would we receive, in memory's ward Storing thy hests; ancestral Jove be witness! DANAUS. Even so; and with benignant eye look down! CHORUS. DANAUS. Delay not. In performance show thy strength. CHORUS. Even there where thou dost sit, I'd sit beside thee! DANAUS. O Jove show pity ere pity come too late! CHORUS. Jove willing, all is well. DANAUS. Him, therefore, pray, There where his bird the altar decorates: pray Apollo, too, the pure, the exiled once From bright Olympus. CHORUS. The Sun's restoring rays We pray: the god what fate he knew will pity. DANAUS. May he with pity and with aid be near! CHORUS. Whom next shall I invoke? DANAUS. Thou seest this trident And know'st of whom the symbol? CHORUS. May the same That sent us hither kindly now receive us! DANAUS. Here's Hermes likewise, as Greece knows the god. CHORUS. Be he my herald, heralding the free! DANAUS. This common altar of these mighty gods Adore: within these holy precincts lodged, Pure doves from hawks of kindred plumage fleeing, Foes of your blood, polluters of your race. Can bird eat bird and be an holy thing? Can man be pure, from an unwilling father Robbing unwilling brides? Who does these deeds Will find no refuge from lewd guilt in Hades; For there, as we have heard, another Jove Holds final judgment on the guilty shades. But now be ready. Here await their coming; May the gods grant a victory to our prayers! Enter King. Whom speak we here? Whence come? Certes no Greeks. Your tire rich-flaunting with barbaric pride Bespeaks you strangers. Argos knows you not, Nor any part of Greece. Strange surely 'tis That all unheralded, unattended all, And of no host the acknowledged guest, unfearing Ye tread this land. If these boughs, woolly-wreathed, That grace the altars of the Agonian gods Speak what to Greeks they should speak, ye are suppliants. Thus much I see: what more remains to guess I spare; yourselves have tongues to speak the truth. CHORUS. That we are strangers is most true; but whom See we in thee? a citizen? a priest? A temple warder with his sacred wand? The ruler of the state? KING. Speak with a fearless tongue, and plainly. I Of old earth-born Palæcthon am the son, My name Pelasgus, ruler of this land; And fathered with my name the men who reap Earth's fruits beneath my sway are called Pelasgi; And all the land where Algos flows, and Strymon, Toward the westering sun my sceptre holds. My kingdom the Perrhæbians bound, and those Beyond high Pindus, by Pæonia, and The Dodonéan heights; the briny wave Completes the circling line; within these bounds I rule; but here, where now thy foot is planted, The land is Apia, from a wise physician Of hoary date so called. He, from Naupactus, Apollo's son, by double right, physician And prophet both, crossed to this coast, and freed it By holy purifyings, from the plague Of man-destroying monsters, which the ground With ancient taint of blood polluted bore. This plague his virtue medicinal healed, That we no more unfriendly fellowship Hold with the dragon-brood. Such worthy service With thankful heart the Argive land received, And Apis lives remembered in her prayers. Of this from me assured, now let me hear Your whence, and what your purpose. Briefly speak; This people hates much phrase. CHORUS. Our tale is short. We by descent are Argives, from the seed Of the heifer sprung, whose womb was blest in bearing; And this in every word we can confirm By manifest proofs. KING. That ye are Argives, this My ear receives not; an unlikely tale! Like Libyan women rather; not a line I trace in you that marks our native race. Nile might produce such daughters; ye do bear A Cyprian character in your female features, The impressed likeness of some plastic male. Of wandering Indians I have heard, that harness Camels for mules, huge-striding, dwelling near The swarthy Æthiop land; ye may be such; Or, had ye war's accoutrement, the bow, Ye might be Amazons, stern, husband-hating, Flesh-eating maids. But speak, that I may know The truth. How vouch ye your descent from Argos? CHORUS. They say that Io, on this Argive ground, Erst bore the keys to Hera, then 'tis said, So runs the general rumour— KING. I have heard. Was it not so, Jove with the mortal maid Mingled in love? CHORUS. Even so; in love they mingled, Deceiving Hera's bed. KING. And how then ended The Olympian strife? CHORUS. Enraged, the Argive goddess To a heifer changed the maid. KING. And the god came To the fair horned heifer? CHORUS. Like a leaping bull, Transformed he came; so the hoar legend tells. KING. And what did then the potent spouse of Jove? CHORUS. She sent a watchman ringed with eyes to watch. KING. This all-beholding herdsman, who was he? CHORUS. Argus the son of Earth, by Hermes slain. KING. How further fared the ill-fated heifer, say? CHORUS. A persecuting brize was sent to sting her. KING. And o'er the wide earth goaded her the brize? CHORUS. Just so; thy tale with mine accordant chimes. KING. Then to Canopus, and to Memphis came she? CHORUS. There, touched by Jove's boon hand, she bore a son. KING. The heifer's boasted offspring, who was he? CHORUS. Epaphus, who plainly with his name declares His mother's safety wrought by touch of Jove. KING. CHORUS. Libya, dowered with a fair land's goodly name. KING. And from this root divine what other shoots? CHORUS. Belus, my father's father, and my uncle's. KING. Who is thy honoured father? CHORUS. Danaus; And fifty sons his brother hath, my uncle. KING. This brother who? Spare not to tell the whole. CHORUS. Ægyptus. Now, O king, our ancient race Thou knowest. Us from our prostration raising, Thou raisest Argos. KING. Argives in sooth ye seem, By old descent participant of the soil; But by what stroke of sore mischance harsh-smitten, Dared ye to wander from your native seats? CHORUS. Pelasgian prince, a motley-threaded web Is human woe; a wing of dappled plumes. Past hope and faith it was that we, whose blood From Argive Io flows, to Io's city, In startled flight, should measure back our way, To escape from hated marriage. KING. How say'st thou? To escape from marriage thou art here, displaying These fresh-cropt branches, snowy-wreathed, before The Agonian gods? CHORUS. Ay! Never, never may we Be thralled to Ægyptus' sons! KING. Speak'st thou of hate To them, or of a bond your laws forbid? CHORUS. Both this and that. Who should be friends were foes, And blood with blood near-mingled basely flows. KING. But branch on branch well grafted goodlier grows. CHORUS. Urge not this point; but rather think one word From thee the wretched rescues. KING. How then shall I My friendly disposition show? CHORUS. We ask But this—from our pursuers save us. KING. What! Shall I for unknown exiles breed a war? CHORUS. Justice will fight for him who fights for us. KING. Doubtless; if Justice from the first hath stamped Your cause for hers. CHORUS (pointing to the altar). The state's high poop here crowned Revere. KING. This green environment of shade, Mantling the seats of the gods I see, and shudder. CHORUS. The wrath of suppliant Jove is hard to bear. Strophe I.—O hear my cry, benignly hear! Thou son of Palæcthon, hear me! The fugitive wandering suppliant hear! Thou king of Pelasgians, hear me! Like a heifer young by the wolf pursued O'er the rocks so cliffy and lonely, And loudly it lows to the herdsman good, Whose strength can save it only. KING. My eyes are tasked; there, 'neath the shielding shade Of fresh-lopt branches I behold you clinging To these Agonian gods; but what I do Must spare the state from harm. I must provide That no unlooked-for unprepared event Beget new strife; of this we have enough. CHORUS. Antistrophe I.—Great Jove that allotteth their lot to all, By his sentence of right shall clear thee, Dread Themis that heareth the suppliants' call, No harm shall allow to come near thee. Though I speak to the old with the voice of the young, Do the will of the gods, and surely Their favour to thee justly weighed shall belong, When thy gifts thou offerest purely. KING. Not at my hearth with precatory boughs Ye lie. The state, if guilty taint from you Affect the general weal, will for the state Take counsel. I nor pledge nor promise give, Till all the citizens hear what thou shalt say. CHORUS. Trophe II.—Thou art the state, and the people art thou, The deed that thou doest who judges? The hearth and the altar before thee bow, The grace that thou grantest who grudges? Thou noddest; the will that thou willest is thine, Thy vote with no voter thou sharest; The throne is all thine, and the sceptre divine, And thy guilt, when thou sinnest, thou bearest. KING. Guilt lie on those that hate me! but your prayers Harmless I may not hear; and to reject them Were harsh. To do, and not to do alike Perplex me; on the edge of choice I tremble. CHORUS. Antistrophe II.—Him worship who sitteth a watchman in Heaven, And looks on this life of our labour; Nor looketh in vain, when the wretched is driven From the gate of his pitiless neighbour. On our knees when we fall, and for mercy we call, If his right thou deny to the stranger, Jove shall look on thy home, from his thunder dome, Sternly wrathful, the suppliants' avenger. KING. But if Ægyptus' sons shall claim you, pleading Their country's laws, and their near kinship, who Shall dare to stand respondent? You must plead Your native laws, so the laws plead for you, And speak you free from who would force your love. CHORUS. Strophe III.—Ah ne'er to the rough-handed youth let me yield, But rather alone, 'neath the wide starry field, Let me wander, an outcast, a stranger! The ill-sorted yoke I abhor: and do thou, With Justice to second thee, judge for me now, And fear Him above, the Avenger! KING. Not I shall judge: it is no easy judgment. What I have said, I said. Without the people I cannot do this thing; being absolute king, I would not. Justly, if mischance shall follow, The popular tongue will blame the ruler, who, To save the stranger, ruined his own flock, CHORUS. Antistrophe III.—Where kindred with kindred contendeth in war, Jove looks on the strife, and decides from afar, Where he holdeth the scales even-handed; O why wilt thou doubt to declare for the right? He blesseth the good, but in anger will smite, Where the sons of the wicked are banded. KING. To advise for you in such confounding depths, My soul should be a diver, to plunge down Far in the pool profound, with seeing eye, And feel no dizziness. 'Tis no light matter Here to unite your safety and the state's. If that your kindred claim you as their right, And we withstand, a bloody strife ensues. If from these altars of the gods we tear you, Your chosen refuge, we shall surely bring The all-destroying god, the stern Alastor, To house with us, whom not the dead in Hades Can flee. Is here no cause to ponder well? CHORUS. Strophe I.—Ponder well; With thee to dwell, A righteous-minded host receive us! Weary-worn, Exiles lorn, From the godless men that grieve us Save to-day; Nor cast-a-way Homeless, houseless, hopeless leave us! ANTISTROPHE I. Shall rash assaulters From these altars Rudely drag the friendless stranger? Thou art king, 'Neath thy wing Cowers in vain the weak from danger? Thy terror show To our fierce foe, Fear, O fear our High Avenger! STROPHE II. Where they see The gods and thee, Shall their lawless will not falter? Shall they tear My floating hair, As a horse dragged by the halter? Wilt thou bear Him to tear My frontlets fair, My linen robes—the bold assaulter? ANTISTROPHE II. One the danger, If the stranger Thou reject, or welcome wisely: For thee and thine To Mars a fine Thou shalt pay the same precisely: From Egypt far Fearing war, Thou shalt mar Thy peace with mighty Jove, not wisely. KING. Both ways I'm marred. Even here my wits are stranded. With these or those harsh war to make, strong Force Compels my will. Nailed am I like a vessel Screwed to the dock, beneath the shipwright's tool. Which way I turn is woe. A plundered house By grace of possessory Jove may freight New ships with bales that far outweigh the loss; And a rash tongue that overshoots the mark With barbéd phrase that harshly frets the heart, With one smooth word, may charm the offence away. But ere the sluice of kindred blood be opened, With vows and victims we must pray the gods Importunate, if perchance such fateful harm They may avert. Myself were little wise To mingle in this strife: of such a war Most ignorant is most blest: but may the gods Deceive my fears, and crown your hopes with blessing! CHORUS. Now hear the end of my respectful prayers. KING. I hear. Speak on. Thy words shall not escape me. CHORUS. Thou see'st this sash, this zone my stole begirding. KING. Fit garniture of women. Yes; I see it. CHORUS. This zone well-used may serve us well. KING. How so? CHORUS. If thou refuse to pledge our safety, then— KING. Thy zone shall pledge it how? CHORUS. Thou shalt behold These ancient altars with new tablets hung. KING. Thou speak'st in riddles. Explain. CHORUS. These gods shall see me Here hanging from their shrines. KING. Hush, maiden! Hush! Thy words pierce through my marrow! CHORUS. Thou hast heard No blind enigma now. I gave it eyes. KING. Alas! with vast environment of ills I'm hedged all round. Misfortune, like a sea Comes rushing in: the deep unfathomed flood I fear to cross, and find no harbour nigh. Thy prayer if I refuse, black horror rises Before me, that no highest-pointed aim May overshoot. If posted fore these walls I give thy kindred battle, I shall be Amerced with bitter loss, who reckless dared For woman's sake to incarnadine the plain With brave men's blood. Yet I perforce must fear The wrath of suppliant Jove, than which no terror Awes human hearts more strongly. Take these branches, Thou aged father of these maids, and place them On other altars of the native gods, Where they may speak, true heralds of thy mission, To all the citizens: and, mark me, keep My words within thy breast: for still the people To spy a fault in whoso bears authority Have a most subtle sight. Trust your good cause. Thy pitiful tale may move their righteous ire Against your haughty-hearted persecutors, And 'neath their wings they'll shield you. The afflicted Plead for themselves: their natural due is kindness. DANAUS. Your worth we know to prize, and at their weight Our high protector's friendly words we value. But send, we pray, attendant guides, to show us The pillar-compassed seats divine, the altars That stand before their temples, who protect This city and this land, and to insure Our safety mid the people: for our coming (Being strangers from the distant Nile, and not Like you that drink the stream of Inachus In features or in bearing) might seem strange. Too bold an air might rouse suspicion; men Oft-times have slain their best friends unawares. KING (to the Attendants). See him escorted well! conduct him hence To the altars of the city, to the shrines Of the protecting gods, wasting no speech On whom you meet. Attend the suppliant stranger! [Exeunt attendants with Danaus. CHORUS. These words to him: and, with his sails well trimmed, Fair be his voyage! But I, what shall I do, My anchor where? KING. Here leave these boughs that prove Thy sorrows. CHORUS. Here at thy rever'd command I leave them. KING. This ample wood shall shade thee; wait thou here! CHORUS. No sacred grove is this: how should it shield me? KING. We will not yield thee to the vultures' claws. CHORUS. But worse than vultures, worse than dragons threat us. KING. Gently. To fair words give a fair reply. CHORUS. I'm terror-struck. Small marvel that I fret. KING. Fear should be far, when I the king am near. CHORUS. With kind words cheer me, and kind actions too. KING. Thy father will return anon; meanwhile I go to call the assembly of the people, And in thy favour move them, if I can. Thy father, too, I'll aptly train, how he Should woo their favor. Wait ye here, and pray The native gods to crown your hearts' desire. I go to speed the business; may Persuasion And Chance, with happy issue pregnant, guide me! CHORAL HYMN. STROPHE I. King of all kings, high-blest above Each blest celestial nature, Strength of the strong, all-glorious Jove, All crowning Consummator! Hear thou our prayer: the proud confound; With hate pursue the hateful, And plunge in purpling pools profound The black-bench'd bark, the fateful! ANTISTROPHE I. Our ancient line from thee we trace Our root divinely planted; Look on these sisters with the grace To that loved maid once granted, Our mother Io; and renew Sweet memory in the daughters Of her thy gentle touch who knew By Nile's deep-rolling waters. STROPHE II. Here, even here, where 'mid the browsing kine, My Argive mother fed her eye divine, With rich mead's flowery store, My Libyan foot I've planted; hence by the brize Divinely fretted with fitful oar she hies From various shore to shore, God-madded wanderer. Twice the billowy wave She crossed; and twice her fated name she gave To the wide sea's straitened roar. ANTISTROPHE II. Spurred through the Asian land with swiftest speed She fled, where Phrygian flocks far-pasturing feed; Then restless travelled o'er Mysia, where Teuthras holds his fortress high, Cilician and Pamphylian heights, and nigh Where roaring waters pour From fountains ever fresh their torrent floods, And Aphrodite's land whose loamy roods Swell with the wheaten store. STROPHE III. Thence by her wingéd keeper stung, she speeds To the land divine, the many-nurturing meads, And to the snow-fed stream, Which like impetuous Typhon, vasty pours Its purest waves, that the salubrious shores From pestilent taint redeem. Here from harsh Hera's madly-goading pest, From hattering chase of undeserved unrest, At length by the holy stream ANTISTROPHE III. She rests. Pale terror smote their hearts who saw. The unwonted sight beheld with startled awe The thronging sons of Nile; Nor dared to approach this thing of human face, Portentous-mingled with the lowing race, Treading the Libyan soil. Who then was he, the brize-stung Io's friend, With charms of soothing virtue strong to end Her weary-wandering toil? STROPHE IV. Jove, mighty Jove, Heaven's everlasting king, He soft-inspiring came, And with fond force innocuous heals her ills; She from her eyes in lucent drops distils The stream of sorrowful shame, And in her womb from Jove a burden bore, A son of blameless fame, Who with his prosperous life long blessed the Libyan shore. ANTISTROPHE IV. Far-pealed the land with jubilant shout—from Jove, From Jove it surely came, This living root of a far-branching line! For who but Jove prevailed, with power divine, Harsh Hera's wrath to tame? Such the great work of Jove; and we are such, O Jove, our race who claim From him whose name declares the virtue of thy touch. STROPHE V. For whom more justly shall my hymn be chaunted Than thee, above all gods that be, high-vaunted, Root of my race, great Jove; Prime moulder from whose plastic-touching hand Life leaps: thine ancient-minded counsels stand, Thou all-devising Jove. ANTISTROPHE V. High-throned above the highest as the lowest, Beyond thee none, and mightier none thou knowest, The unfearing, all-feared one. When his deep thought takes counsel to fulfil, No dull delays clog Jove's decided will; He speaks, and it is done. Enter DANAUS. Be of good cheer, my daughters! All is well, The popular voice hath perfected our prayers. CHORUS. Hail father, bearer of good news: but say, How was the matter stablished? and how far Prevailed the people's uplifted hands to save us? DANAUS. Not doubtingly, but with a bold decision, That made my old heart young again to see't. With one acclaim, a forest of right hands Rose through the hurtled air. These Libyan exiles— So ran the popular will—shall find a home In Argos, free, and from each robber hand Inviolate, the native or the stranger; And, whoso holding Argive land refuses To shield these virgins from the threatened force, Disgrace shall brand him, and the popular vote Oust him from Argos. Such response the king Persuasive forced, with wise admonishment; Urging the wrath of Jove, which else provoked Would fatten on our woes, and the twin wrong To you the stranger, and to them the city, Pollution at their gate, a fuel to feed Ills without end. These words the Argive people Answered with suffragating hands, nor waited The herald's call to register their votes: Just eloquence ruled their willing ear, and Jove Crowned their fair purpose with the perfect deed. [Exit. CHORUS. Come then, sisters, pour we freely Grateful prayers for Argive kindness; Jove, the stranger's friend, befriend us, While from stranger's mouth sincerest Here we voice the hymn; To a blameless issue, surely, Jove will guide the fate. CHORAL HYMN. STROPHE I. Jove-born gods, benignly bending, Look, we pray, with eyes befriending, On these Argive halls! Ne'er may Mars, the wanton daring, With his shrill trump, joyless-blaring, Wrap, in wild flames, fiercely flaring, These Pelasgian walls! Go! thy gory harvest reaping Far from us: thy bloody weeping Distant tribes may know. Bless, O Jove, this Argive nation! They have heard the supplication Of thy suppliants low; Where the swooping Fate abased us, They with Mercy's vote upraised us From the prostrate woe! ANTISTROPHE I. Not with the male, the stronger, erring, But, woman's weaker cause preferring, Stood their virtue proof: Wisely Jove, the Avenger, fearing, To the chastened eye appearing, High his front of wrath up-rearing 'Gainst the guilty roof. For heavily, heavily weighs the Alastor, Scapeless, and, with sore disaster, Sinks the sinner low. Bless, O Jove, this Argive nation, That knew their kindred's supplication, And saved them from the foe: And when their vows they pay, then surely Gifts from clean hands offered purely Thou in grace shalt know. STROPHE II. High these suppliant branches raising, Sisters, ancient Argos praising, Pour the grateful strain! Far from thy Pelasgian portals Dwell black Plague, from drooping mortals Ebbing life to drain! May'st thou see the crimson river From fierce home-bred slaughter, never Flowing o'er thy plain! Far from thee the youth-consuming Blossom-plucking strife! The harsh spouse of Aphrodite, Furious Mars in murder mighty, Where he sees thy beauty blooming, Spare his blood-smeared knife! ANTISTROPHE II. May a reverend priesthood hoary Belt thy shrines, their chiefest glory, With an holy band! By the bountiful libation, By the blazing pile, this nation Shall securely stand. Jove, the great All-ruler, fearing, Jove, the stranger's stay, revering, Ye shall save the land; Jove, sure-throned above all cavil, Rules by ancient right. May just rulers never fail thee! Holy Hecate's aid avail thee, To thy mothers when in travail Sending labours light! STROPHE III. May no wasting march of ruin Work, O Argos, thine undoing! Never may'st thou hear Cries of Mars, the shrill, the lyreless! Ne'er may tearful moans, and quireless, Wake the sleeper's ear! Far from thee the shapes black-trooping Of disease, delightless-drooping! May the blazing death-winged arrow Of the Sun-god spare the marrow Of thy children dear! ANTISTROPHE III. Mighty Jove, the gracious giver, With his full-sheaved bounty ever Crown the fruited year! Flocks that graze before thy dwelling With rich increase yearly swelling The prosperous ploughman cheer! May the gods no grace deny thee, And the tuneful Muses nigh thee, With exuberant raptures brimming, From virgin throats thy praises hymning Hold the charmèd ear! STROPHE IV. O'er the general weal presiding, They that rule with far-providing Wisdom sway, and stably-guiding, Changeful counsels mar! Timely with each foreign nation Leagues of wise conciliation Let them join, fierce wars avoiding, From sharp losses far! ANTISTROPHE IV. The native gods, strong to deliver, With blood of oxen free-poured ever, With laurel-branches failing never, Piously adore! Honour thy parents: spurn not lightly This prime statute sanctioned rightly; Cling to this, a holy liver, Steadfast evermore! Re-enter DANAUS. Well hymned, my daughters! I commend your prayers; But brace your hearts, nor fear, though I, your father, Approach the bearer of unlooked for news. For from this consecrated hold of gods I spy the ship; too gallantly it peers To cheat mine eye. The sinuous sail I see, The bulging fence-work on each side, the prow Fronted with eyes to track its watery way, True to the steerman's hint that sits behind, And with no friendly bearing. On the deck Appear the crew, their swarthy limbs more swart By snow-white vests revealed: a goodly line Of succour in the rear: but in the van The admiral ship, with low-furled sail makes way By the swift strokes of measured-beating oars. Wait calmly ye, and with well-counselled awe Cling to the gods; the while ye watch their coming, Myself will hence, and straight return with aid To champion our need. For I must look for Some herald or ambassador claiming you, Their rightful prey, forthwith; but fear ye not, Their harsh will may not be. This warning take Should we with help be slow, remain you here Nor leave these gods, your strength. Faint not: for surely Comes the appointed hour, and will not stay, When godless men to Jove just fine shall pay. CHORUS. Strophe I.—Father, I tremble, lest the fleet-winged ships, Ere thou return, shall land—soon—very soon! O father I tremble to stay, and not flee, When the bands of the ruthless are near! My flight to foreclose from the chase of my foes! O father I faint for fear! DANAUS. Fear not my children. The accomplished vote Of Argos saves you. They are champions sworn. CHORUS. Antistrophe I.—They come—destruction's minions mad with hate, Of fight insatiate: well thou know'st the men. With their host many-counted, their ships dark-fronted, They are near, O father, how near! Their ships stoutly-timbered, their crews swarthy-membered, Triumphant in wrath I fear! DANAUS. Even let them come. They'll find their match in Argos; A strong-limbed race with noon-day sweats well hardened. CHORUS. Strophe II.—Only not leave me! Pray thee, father stay! Weak is a lonely woman. No Mars is in her. Dark-counselled, false, cunning-hearted are they, Unholy, as obscene crows On the feast of the altar that filthily prey; They fear not the gods, my foes! DANAUS. 'Twill make our cause the stronger, daughters, if Their crime be sacrilege, and their foes the gods. CHORUS. Antistrophe II.—The trident and the sacred blazonry Will not repel their violent hands, O father! They are proud, haughty-hearted, a high-blown race; They are hot, they are mad for the fray! With the hound in their heart, and the dog in their face, They will tear from the altar their prey. DANAUS. Dogs let them be, the world has wolves to master them! And good Greek corn is better than papyrus. CHORUS. Being reasonless as brutes, unholy monsters, And spurred with wrath we must beware their fury. DANAUS. 'Tis no light work to land a fleet. To find Safe roads, sure anchorage, and to make fast The cables, this not with mere thought is done. The shepherds of the ships are slow to feel Full confidence, the more that on this coast Harbours are few. Besides, thou see'st the sun Slants to the night; and still a prudent pilot Fears in the dark. No man will disembark, Trust me, till all are firmly anchored. Thou Through all thy terrors still cling to the gods, Thy most sure stay. Thy safety's pledged. For me I'm old, but with the tongue of fluent youth I'll speak for thee, a pleader without blame. [Exit. CHORAL HYMN. STROPHE I. O hilly land, high-honored land, What wait we now, poor fugitive band? Some dark, dark cave Show me, within thy winding strand, To hide and save! Would I might vanish in smoke, ascending To Heaven, with Jove's light clouds dim-blending In misty air, Like wingless, viewless dust, and ending In nothing there! ANTISTROPHE I. 'Tis more than heart may bear. Quick Fear My quaking life with dusky drear Alarm surroundeth! My father spied my ruin: sheer Despair confoundeth. Sooner, high-swung from fatal rope, Here may I end both life and hope, And strong Death bind me, Than hated hearts shall reach their scope, And shame shall find me! STROPHE II. Would I were throned in ether high, Where snows are born, and through the sky The white rack skurries! Would that I Might sit sublime On a hanging cliff where lone winds sigh, Where human finger never showed The far-perched vultures' drear abode, Nor goat may climb! Thence sheer to leap, and end for ever My life and name, Ere forceful hands this heart deliver To married shame! ANTISTROPHE II. There, where no friendly foot may stray, There let me lie, my limbs a prey To dogs and birds: I not gainsay: 'Twas wisely said, Free from much woe who dies to-day Shall be to-morrow. Rather than wedded To whom I hate, let me be bedded Now with the dead! Or if there be, my life to free, A way, declare it, Ye gods!—a surgeon's cut for me, My heart shall bear it! STROPHE III. Voice ye your sorrow! with the cry Of doleful litany pierce the sky! For freedom, for quick rescue cry To him above! Ruler of Earth, look from thy throne, With eyes of love! These deeds of violence wilt thou own, Nor know thy prostrate suppliant's groan, Almighty Jove? ANTISTROPHE III. Ægyptus' sons, a haughty race, Follow my flight with sleepless chase, With whoop and bay they scent my trace To force my love. Thy beam is true; both good and ill Thy sure scales prove, Thou even-handed! Mortals still Reap fair fulfilment from thy will, All-crowning Jove. CHORUS (In separate voices, and short hurried exclamations.) Voice 1. —Ah me! he lands!—he leaps ashore! He strides with ruffian hands to hale us! Voice 2. —Cry, sisters, cry! swift help implore! If here to cry may aught avail us! Voice 3. —Ah me! 'tis but the muffled roar Of forceful storms soon to assail us! Voice 1. —Flee to the gods! to the altars cling! Voice 2. —By sea, by land, the ruthless foe Grimly wantons in our woe! Voice 3. —Beneath thy wing shield us, O king! Enter HERALD. Hence to the ships! to the good ships fare ye! Swiftly as your feet may bear ye! CHORUS. Tear us! tear us! Rend us rather, Torture and tear us! From this body Cut the head! Gorily gather Us to the dead! HERALD. Hence to the ships, away! away! A curse on you, and your delay! O'er the briny billowy way Thou shalt go to-day, to-day! Wilt thou stand, a mulish striver, I can spur, a forceful driver; Deftly, deftly, thou shalt trip To the stoutly-timbered ship! If to yield thou wilt not know, Gorily, gorily thou shalt go! An' thou be not madded wholly, Know thy state, and quit thy folly! CHORUS. Help, ho! help, ho! help! HERALD. To the ships! to the ships away with me! These gods of Argos what reck we? CHORUS. Never, O never The nurturing river, Of life the giver, The healthful flood That quickens the blood Let me behold! An Argive am I, From Inachus old, These gods deny Thy claim. Withhold! HERALD. To the ships, to the ships, with march not slow, Will ye, nill ye, ye must go! Quickly, quickly, hence away! Know thy master and obey! Ere a worst thing thou shalt know— Blows and beating—gently go! CHORUS. Strophe I.—Worse than worsest May'st thou know! As thou cursest, Curst be so! The briny billow O'er thee flow! On sandy pillow Bedded low, 'Neath Sarpedon's breezy brow, With the shifting sands shift thou! HERALD. Scream—rend your robes in rags!—call on the gods! The Egyptian bark thou shalt not overleap. Pour ye the bitter bootless wail at will! CHORUS. Antistrophe I.—With fierce heart swelling To work my woe, With keen hate yelling Barks the foe. Broad Nile welling O'er thee flow! Find thy dwelling Bedded low 'Neath the towering Libyan waters, Towering thou 'gainst Libya's daughters! HERALD. To the ships! to the ships! the swift ships even-oared! Quickly! no laggard shifts! the hand that drags thee Will lord it o'er thy locks, not gently handled! CHORUS. Strophe II.—O father, oh! From the altar The assaulter Drags me to my woe! Step by step, a torturing guider, Like the slowly-dragging spider, Cruel-minded so! Like a dream, A dusky dream, My hope away doth go! O Earth, O Earth, From death redeem! O Earth, O Jove deliver! HERALD. Your Argive gods I know not; they nor nursed My infant life, nor reared my riper age. CHORUS. Antistrophe II.—O father, oh! From the altar The assaulter Drags me to my woe! A snake two-footed fiercely fretted Swells beside me! from his whetted Fangs, black death doth flow! Like a dream, A dusky dream, My hope is vanished so! O Earth, O Earth From death redeem! O Earth, O Jove deliver! HERALD. To the ships! to the ships! Obey! I say, obey! Pity thy robes, if not thy flesh—away! CHORUS. Strophe III.—Ye chiefs of the city, By force they subdue me! HERALD. Well! I must drag thee by the hair! come! come! Point thy dull ears, and hear me!—come! come! come! CHORUS. Antistrophe III.—I'm lost! I'm ruined! O king they undo me! HERALD. Thou shalt see kings enough anon, believe me, Ægyptus' sons—kingless thou shalt not die. Enter KING with attendants. Fellow, what wouldst thou? With what purpose here Dost flout this land of brave Pelasgian men? Deem'st thou us women? A barbarian truly Art thou, if o'er the Greek to sport it thus The fancy tempts thee. Nay, but thou art wrong Both root and branch in this. HERALD. How wrong? Speak plainly. KING. Thou art a stranger here, and dost not know As a stranger how to bear thee. HERALD. This I know, I lost my own, and what I lost I found. KING. Thy patrons who, on this Pelasgian ground? HERALD. To find stray goods the world all over, Hermes Is prince of patrons. KING. Hermes is a god, Thou, therefore, fear the gods. HERALD. And I do fear The gods of the Nile. KING. We too have gods in Argos. HERALD. So be it: but, in Argos or in Africk, My own's my own. KING. Who touches these reaps harm, And that right soon. HERALD. No friendly word thou speak'st, To welcome strangers. KING. Strangers are welcome here; But not to spoil the gods. HERALD. These words of thine To Ægyptus' sons be spoken, not to me. KING. I take no counsel, or from them, or thee. HERALD. Thou—who art thou? for I must plainly make Rehearsal to my masters—this my office Enforces—both by whom, and why, unjustly I of this kindred company of women Am robbed. A serious strife it is; no bandying Of words from witnesses, no silver passed From hand to hand will lay such ugly strife; But man for man must fall, and noblest souls Must dash their lives away. KING. For what I am, You, and your shipmates, soon enough shall know me. These maids, if with the softly suasive word Thou canst prevail, are thine; to force we never Will yield the suppliant sisters; thus the people With one acclaim have voted; 'tis nailed down Thus to the letter. So it must remain. Thou hast my answer, not in tablets graven, Or in the volumed scroll, all stamped and sealed, But from a free Greek mouth. Dost understand me? Hence quickly from my sight! HERALD. Of this be sure, A war thou stirrest, in which, when once begun, The males will be the stronger. KING. We too, have males In Argos, lusty-blooded men, who drink Good wine, not brewed from barley. As for you, Ye virgins, fearless follow where these guides Shall lead. Our city strongly girt with wall, And high-reared tower receives you. We can boast Full many a stately mansion; stateliest piled My palace stands, work of no feeble hands. Right pleasant 'tis in populous floors to lodge With many a fellow-tenant: some will find A greater good in closely severed homes, That have no common gates: of these thou hast The ample choice: take what shall like thee most. Know me thy patron, and in all things know My citizens thy shield, whose vote hath pledged Thy safety; surer guarantee what wouldst thou? CHORUS. Blessing for thy blessing given, Flow to thee, divine Pelasgian! But for our advisal forthwith Send, we pray thee, for our father: He the firm, the far foreseeing, How to live, and where to lodge us, Duly shall direct. For ever Quick to note the faults of strangers Sways the general tongue; though we Hope all that's good and best from thee. KING (to the attendant maids). Likewise you, ye maids attendant For his daughters' service, wisely Portioned by the father, here Be your home secure, Far from idle-bruited babblings, 'Neath my wing to dwell! Enter DANAUS, attended by an Argive guard. Daughters! if so the Olympian gods deserve Your sacrifices, your libations, surely Argos no less may claim them! Argos truly Your Saviour in worst need! With eager ears They drank my tale, indignant the foul deeds Of our fell-purposed cousinship they heard, And for my guard this goodly band they set me Of strong spear-bearing men, lest being slain By the lurking lance of some insidious foe My death bring shame to Argos. Such high honour, From hearts where kindness moves the friendly deed, They heaped the sire withal, that you, the daughters, In father's stead should own them. For the rest, To the chaste precepts graven on your heart That oft I gave, one timely warning add, That Time, which proveth all, approve your lives Before this people; for 'gainst the stranger calumny Flows deftly from the tongue, and cheap traducement Costs not a thought. I charge ye, therefore, daughters, Your age being such that turns the eyes of men To ready gaze, in all ye do, consult Your father's honour: such ripe bloom as yours No careless watch demands: so fair a flower Wild beasts and men, monsters of all degrees, Winged and four-footed, wantonly will tear. Her luscious-dropping fruits the Cyprian hangs In the general view, and publishes their praise; That whoso passes, and beholds the pomp Of shapeliest beauty, feels the charmed dart That shoots from eye to eye, and vanquished falls By strong desire. Give, therefore, jealous heed That our long toils, and ploughing the deep sea Not fruitless fall; but be your portment such As breeds no shame to us, nor to our enemies Laughter. A double lodgment for our use, One from the state, the other from the king, Rentless we hold. All things look bright. This only, Your father's word, remember. More than life Hold a chaste heart in honour. CHORUS. The high Olympians Grant all thy wish! For us, and our young bloom, Fear nothing, father: for unless the gods Have forged new counsels, we ev'n to the end Will tread the trodden path, and will not bend. CHORAL HYMN. STROPHE I. Semi-chorus I. —Lift ye the solemn hymn! High let your pæans brim! Praise in your strain Gods that in glory reign High o'er the Argive plain, High o'er each castled hold, Where Erasinus old Winds to the main! (To the attendant maids. Semi-chorus II. —Sing, happy maids, with me! Loud with responsive glee Voice ye the strain! Praise ye the Argive shore, Praise holy Nile no more, Wide where his waters roar, Mixed with the main! ANTISTROPHE I. Semi-chorus I. —Lift ye the solemn hymn! High let your pæans brim! Praise in your strain Torrents that bravely swell Fresh through each Argive dell, Broad streams that lazily Wander, and mazily Fatten the plain. Semi-chorus II. —Sing, sisters, sing with me Artemis chaste! may she List to the strain! Never, O never may Marriage with fearful sway Bind me; nor I obey Hatefullest chain! STROPHE II.

Semi-chorus II. —With thee Desire doth go; Peitho, with suasive flow Bending the willing foe, Marches with thee. Lovely Harmonia Knows thee; and, smote with awe, Strong kings obey the law Whispered by thee. STROPHE IV. Semi-chorus I. —Yet must I fear the chase, Sail spread in evil race, War with a bloody pace Spurred after me. Why to this Argive shore Came they with plashing oar, If not with sorrow's store Treasured for me? Semi-chorus II. —Comes fated good or ill, Wait we in patience still; No power may thwart his will Jove, mighty Jove. Laden with sorrow's store Virgins in days of yore Praised, when their grief was o'er, Jove, mighty Jove. Semi-chorus I. —Jove, mighty Jove, may he From wedded force for me Rescue prepare! Semi-chorus II. —Fair fall our maiden lot! But mighty Jove may not Yield to thy prayer. Semi-chorus I. —Know'st thou what woes may be Stored yet by Fate for me? Semi-chorus II. —Jove and his hidden plan Sight of the sharpest man Searcheth in vain; Thou in thy narrow span Wisely remain! Semi-chorus I. —Wisely my thought may fare Tell me, O tell me where? Semi-chorus II. —'Gainst what the gods ordain Fret not thy heart in vain! STROPHE. Semi-chorus I. —Save me, thou chief of gods, great Jove, From violent bonds of hated love, Even as the Inachian maid of yore Thy hand set free from labour sore, What time thou soothed with touch divine Her weary frame, And with a friendly force benign Thy healing came. ANTISTROPHE. Semi-chorus II. —May the woman's cause prevail! And, when two certain ills assail, Be ours the less: and Justice fair For the just shall still declare. Ye mighty gods o'er human fates Supremely swaying, On you my prayer, my fortune waits, Your will obeying.</field>
