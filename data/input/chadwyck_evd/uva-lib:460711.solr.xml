      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTORY SCENES. The Sea-shore. A boat approaches the land; from which descend Sweyn, Canute, Gothmund, Turkill, Anlaffe, &amp;c. &amp;c. ANLAFFE. The Saints be praised! we're on dry land again. GOTHMUND. Ay, and have bid the tempest brave defiance. Welcome unto these famous shores of Cornwall; Welcome, my liege! CANUTE. It bears a winning aspect; This deep and sunny bay, round whose broad bosom The leafy cliffs wind their umbrageous arms, As if they loved the element that woos Their rugged feet with all its crowding billows. How sportively they toss their foaming tresses,â And on their bright cheeks give a quick reflection To all that look upon them! But, my liege, My royal father, you look pensively On that which stirs up thus my youthful blood. Is your grace well? SWEYN. Ay, my brave son, yet sad; Sad, and without a cause. Those raging seas Have left a heaviness upon my eyes, A weight upon my heart. ANLAFFE. Fling it off, thusâ As I throw out my arms to thee, fair England,â Thou glorious land of hope! CANUTE. See, every bough Nods welcome to the fearless and the free. The green fields, in this glow of setting sun, Smile with a present promise; the blue mountains Look through the calm serenity of air With eyes of hope upon us;âay, these sounds Of winds and waters breathe a stirring music, As the swell of a trumpet on a battle field; Or, in their milder mood, like the sweet close Of virgin-voices singing holy hymns. SWEYN. Now, to my ears, it hath a fall of sadness, Most melancholy, full of mournful omens; And greets our raven-banner with a note As boding as the emblem. CANUTE. Sir, you do wrest All nature from her true intent. Indeed You are not well. Vainly our sails have been Fill'd with the strong gales of our swelling fortune If now you droop. GOTHMUND. My lord, look cheerily. We Northmen soon are thaw'd in this soft climate. Sweet smells the moist breath of this bloomy bank, Born amid odours. SWEYN. Sirs, I wish you joy Of your young spirits, that can quit grave thoughts As the grub casts its scale off in the sun, And wings the air a butterfly, and lives On light and flowers. I have the eyes of age, And have learn'd wisdom from unwelcome masters, Drawn prescience from the lessons of the past, And judgment from most sorrowful experience. There is a shadow now before my eyes Ye cannot see; there is a voice upon These subtle winds, a tongue amid these trees, Ye hear not: ay, an awful presence dwells Among us now, ye feel not; but I feel it. It has been thus before, and evil days Have follow'd after. GOTHMUND. Soft, my lord, here comes A courier, and in haste; and, as I think, By his pale face, a messenger of evil. Enter Courier. SWEYN. Said I not true, my lords? Well, sir, you bring News from our friends; ill news, I fear. I pray you, Speak; are we timely landed? speak, sir, I pray. COURIER (kneeling). Alas! a choking grief ties up my tongue. Timeless, yet timely art thou come, King Sweyn. Timeless to save, yet timely to avenge. Death, bloody death, hath been before. SWEYN. My son, Let me sit down upon this bank: a sickly Faintness hath ta'en me suddenly, and makes My limbs weak. Speak!âmy daughter? COURIER. Sir, she lives. SWEYN. Just Heaven, I thank thee! COURIER. Still Gunilda lives; But lives to pray for death. Her wandering feet Journey close after me, scarce knowing whither. But she would seek her father's neck with tears, And rend her widow'd hair out in his arms, And beat her childless bosom at his feet. SWEYN. Dread words are these thou speak'st! How has this been? COURIER. Oh, sir, the Saxon sword has been well blooded! And cruel Edricâ CANUTE. Where is my sister? Say! COURIER. I left her in a dark glade of the woods Some furlongs hence; in wayward fancy chosen, As a meet place, she said, for broken hearts. Old, ivied oaks, mossy with age, and grey With the unwholesome lichen, shut out the sun From the long wiry grass, dock-weed, and hemlock, That droop beneath. SWEYN. I'm somewhat now revived Lead to my daughter. CANUTE. And, as we journey onward, Explain at large thy most disastrous tidings. [Exeunt. A dark glade in a wood. Gunilda seated on a bank; her appearance wild and disordered. A Lady in attendance. LADY. Sweet madam, speak! Oh, for the love of Heaven! Let me but hear that blessed voice again. She will not answer me! she hears me not! What can I do? No help near,ânot a creature,â No human thing to comfort us. Great God! What if her brain should madden? Dear, dear lady! The night is growing chill; we have no shelter. Look up,âhow dark the clouds are! Pray arise! Let's leave these gloomy caverns of arch'd boughs; The lightsome fields will make you better. Come,â It is no place for living things. GUNILDA. My children! Oh, my poor little ones! my husband! LADY. Nay, For mercy's sake, compose your mind. I hear The tramp of horsemen hitherward. Alas! How desolate we are! Enter Sweyn, Canute, and suite. LADY. Kind Heaven be praised! I have not pray'd in vain. SWEYN (embracing GUNILDA, who remains unmoved). My sweetest daughterâ Gunilda! look on your old father; hear me;â I come to thee weigh'd down by age and sorrow, Yet strong enough to share thine too. Look on meâ Oh God! all sense has fled. CANUTE. Let me speak, father. My sisterâmy Gunildaâdost not feel Thy brother's faithful arm around thy waist?â She heeds not,âno, her mind is warp'd from earth, And her eye gleams with visionary wildness. See what a sad smile gathers on her lipâ Her dream is now of heaven, her children's home. Such, 'twere scarce mercy to disturb. SWEYN. Not so: Oh, let not madness feed on that sweet heart! Those features, now so pale and passionless, That dim eye, fix'd in awful calmness thus, Portend tempestuous sallies yet. Arouse her, Or she is lost for ever. CANUTE. Dearest sister! Look on the grey hairs of thy father!âsee him, An old man weeping as a child; a soldier Even like a woman grieving. Is't not strange A father thus should meet his living child? 'Tis thus we mourn the dead. GUNILDA. The deadâthe dead? Ay, all that live must die,âwhat matter when? If soon, then happy!âWho art thouâand thou? SWEYN. Gunilda! GUNILDA. Hark!âthat voice!âhark!âOh my father! I know thee now: and thee, sweet brother. Give me Your hands: let us be gone from this,âthese glooms Disturb me. See! these old oaks, how they toss Their arms up, in appeal from earth to heaven! And hark! their groans!âand then the sighing winds Like the lone voice of sorrow o'er a tomb! CANUTE. It is, in truth, a melancholy haunt. We will depart. GUNILDA. No! now methinks 'tis wholesome To commune here with melancholy thoughts. The outer world is mad with reckless mirth, And drunken Laughter reels 'mid gaping graves; But Wisdom has her seat, with Sadness, here. Yet, who shall brave despair? Oh, sir! this earth Is sick with horrors!âthe black midnight air Hath hung its pall above such deeds! Blood,âblood Doth smear the cheek of morning, and the sun Sinks on a bloody pillow. Men! I tell ye Murder is grown familiar, carnage a game A daily, wholesale game, which you all play at. Why, 'tis the common pastime of these kings To make wives widows, and poor mothers childless. Ay, stamp on earth; 'tis hollow: nought but the shell Of a vast, crumbling charnel. SWEYN. Would I were laid there! Thy misery makes me wish to die with thee. GUNILDA. Father, why are you grieved?âI do not grieve you, Do I, sweet father?âTalk you of dying with me? We'll make our graves togetherâcomeâour task Is one of toil, delay not; we must have room To pillow my fair infants on this bosom: They'll sleep on nought less soft. [She shrieks.] Where are they now? If but the wind blew chill, then would they shudderâ If you look'd grave upon them, they grew paleâ If touch'd too roughly on the cheek, they weptâ And nowânowâFather! brother! I beheld them Shrieking and clinging to their father's breast, Kissing his white and gasping lipsâhis eyes In their last dying spasmâthat still saw The butchery they shared with him. I saw them Writhing beneath their daggersâay, and heard The stabbingsâhereâhere in my brain! Poor babes! They cast them out, when dead, to the cold moon, And freezing night-windsâand I live. You weep, And pity me that I do live. Sit down, And I will tell you stories of my children. SWEYN. Here do I kneel beside thee, and invoke Thy thunders and thy lightnings, and thy tempests, Upon their savage heads, god of my fathers! Canute, my son, kneel down with me, and swear Hate that ne'er sleeps, vengeance insatiable! CANUTE. May this right hand shrivel in timeless age, If it forgets its vengeance! So may I thrive Hereafter, as I satisfy this wrong! Hear, Ethelred of England!âhear, false Edric! On you and all your lineage I vow The hate that knows not mercy! [During these speeches Gunilda has knelt beside them. GOTHMUND. Silently She ratifies the curse: the gloomy passion Creeps, like the shadow of death, across her features. How awful is this silent imprecation, Whose import is but guess'd at in the glare Of the dark, hollow, supernatural eye; In the dread smile that curls the livid lips; In the clench'd, quivering hands, and feeble frame With powerless anguish heaving. SWEYN. She grows paler. Oh, lift her up, my lords, and softly bear her To present aid. GOTHMUND. That hope were vain: she is dying. Crowd not aroundâgive air. LADY. Nay, hold her hands. This sudden flush and struggle will be her last. Her limbs subsideâher cheeks grow darkly paleâ She breathes notâher heart's broken! CANUTE (stooping over the body). Thus, Gunilda, I kiss thee for the last timeâmy poor sister! Yet shalt thou be avengedâamply avenged! Gothmund, do thou prepare fit obsequies, And lay her with her children. Come, my father; Lean on meâyou are faint. Nay, steel your heart With thoughts of our full vengeance! So, you revive. Forward, my lords; to death or victory! And be our cryââRevenge!âGunilda's wrongs!â [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART THE FIRST. THE COURTIERS. The Palace of London. Enter the Earls of Northumberland, Bulloign, and Cornwall; Frithegist, Morcar, and Sigiferth. NORTHUMBERLAND. Brother of Bulloign, 'tis a day of sorrow That frowns on your arrival. BULLOIGN. Thou speak'st truly, Good brother Uthred: he has lost all spirit, And seems, indeed, in great extremity. How happen'd this? Such deep despondency Is sanction'd by nought urgent? NORTHUMBERLAND. He has been ill Of body, and much shaken in his mind Since those sad, bloody vespers of Saint Brice. BULLOIGN. Ay, 'twas a sweeping massacre. CORNWALL. Methinks The ghosts of all those pretty Danish babes That, with their slaughter'd mothers, died that night, Are ever present at his bed and board. And yet the deed was needful. BULLOIGN. Say not so: The act was hellish; mark the penalty. NORTHUMBERLAND. The act was needful, and I sanction'd it. Eustace, there was a rank disease, that needed To be let blood. Shake not your head: we are not Nice reasoners here on points of precedent, But cut our way through with our Saxon swords. Enter Prince Edwy: after him Edmund. BULLOIGN. Edwy, how fares our father Ethelred? NORTHUMBERLAND. Good brother, speak. [Edwy walks past, moodily, and in silence. All salute Edmund. EDMUND. My lords, I give you thanks. Yet, though you bow thus, like th' old Persian sages, In worship of the rising sun, believe me, I much rejoice to be the messenger Of comfortable news to loyal hearts. My brother, here, doubtless, hath told how far His grace hath been revived. EDWY. Nay, sir, not I: Enough for me the king is like to live: Such news will be its own good trumpeter. NORTHUMBERLAND (aside). Well art thou named, proud Edwy, King of Churls! EDMUND. Dear brother of Northumberland, the king, In this extremity of ill-timed sickness, Yields for a space his sceptre to my hands; (Weak though they be in youth, and lacking that Which yet your sage experience shall supply); And, furthermore, to make assurance firm, Hath join'd Lord Edric, Duke of Mercia, In the commission. So shall our fiery haste Be, by his politic caution, tempered. NORTHUMBERLAND. Oh, sorrowful conclusion to our hopes! So ends a dream of promise. SIGIFERTH. Hath the king Named Edric as joint regent with your grace? Why then 'tis time for honest men to fly; At least, good Morcar, we, though loyal, yet Most hateful, being Danes. EDMUND. Nay, Sigiferth, Your speech is more in haste than reason. Oh! You have a fair wife; fame speaks kindly of her. You seek excuse for leisure, she being absent;â A daughter too? SIGIFERTH. My liege, I have a wife That is indeed a miracle; but not As being beautiful, though she is beautiful; Nor yet as wise, though she is full of wisdom; But for strong virtue and a pious heart. How can we live, sir, 'neath the savage hand, Red with the gore of our slain countrymen? Edric being king, then tremble Danes! EDMUND. By heaven! You give your tongue, my lord, a dangerous licence. A fell deed hath been done, (how I abhor The act ye know) and idle imputations Have touch'd this Duke of Mercia. Sir, his name Must not be shot at with these random shafts. He is my sister's husband, and most closely Wrapp'd in the mantle of my father's favour. Speak then advisedly. BULLOIGN. Brave brother Edmundâ Or, pardon me, my Prince!âas your new stationâ EDMUND. Nay, Eustace, call me brother still. Affection Regards not unsubstantial things, as titles. All hearts that love are equal. BULLOIGN. Well, my brotherâ My noble-minded brother (I will call you so), Trust not your generous heart too far. Duke Edric, Though of our kindred, is notâI must say itâ The favourite of good fame. I am distrustful. EDMUND. 'Tis hard to judge men's hearts; nor should we judge Too harshly. As for me, I'm somewhat young T' have studied men's minds deeply. I look round Upon the superficial face of things, And, like the swallow, skim the smoothest wave; Or, moth-like, perch upon the brightest flower. 'Till now I deem'd all life was as a spring, And turn'd my cheek to sunshine, like a plant. I saw all nature beautiful, and deem'd All creatures good. Now must I prune my spirit, And bend my mind down to the tasks of age. I must discard those graceful witcheries That take the buoyant phantasy of youth, Moulding its airy speculation to Shapes almost palpable. Away with them! The dark days of reality are come. Welcome the storms of life! Welcome the strife That flashes round the stations of the great, Like lightnings o'er the mountain-tops! Why, ay,â I was not made to lie for ever on The lap of joy. I'll strain my eaglet-wing Against these tempests, and with dauntless eye Look up unto this sun of Denmark. But, My lords, I cry you mercy for this sally: Somewhat too harshly, I do think, opinion Deals with the Duke of Mercia. NORTHUMBERLAND. Know you not Edric? Alas, sir, you will know him soon,âtoo soon! Even thus he wound his thrall round Ethelred, Who felt not 'twas a yoke firmer than steel. I have seen him, in the midst of all our nobles, A well-proved traitor; yet was he seated so, Even in the heart's core of his cheated sovereign, That, with some specious fawning, a fair show Of zealous protestation, upturn'd eyes, Hand on the heart, and bold appeals to Heaven, He so rubb'd off the stain, that it but won him The greater trust. None could withstand him,ânone. Nor is't so strange; for we must all admit him A man of a most admirable presence, Subtle of wit, and eloquent of speech, Of station high, most noble in alliance, Second to none for riches; and, with all, Unbending in his selfishness; cool, crafty, Scorner of truth, heartless, inexorable;â In fine, a man without a conscience. CORNWALL. Truly, Lord Uthred, you have laid your colours on With an unsparing hand; and, I make bold To say, a coarse one, and not just to nature. I'm honour'd in his confidence, and assert The king has not a liege-man truer of faith, Juster of thought, more resolute in action, Than him you trample down in absence thus. [During these speeches Edric has entered unobserved. EDRIC (stepping forward). My generous lord of Cornwall, many thanks For your protection of an absent friend. My lords! I knew not that I stood on trial. Where are my jury?âwho the judge? Prince Edmund! You here? Oh, then, I'm sure of justice! Pray you, Earl of Northumberland, proceed: you play Th' accuser well: proceed. Few words I caught; But they were eloquent, and took my fancy. I thank you for this pleasantry; go on. I feel a real debt that you should notice My poor obscurity,âthus dragging forth My blushing weakness to this brilliant circle. Nay, sir, you seem abash'd,âconfused,âbelieve it, I ever lie uneasy under debt. NORTHUMBERLAND. Edric of Mercia, there are certain debts You do make point of cancelling. Abash'd? By thee?âSir, I conceive your irony: Ay, sir, and brave it! EDMUND. Brothers, no more of this. Edric, you have been to blame. What thus by stealth You have heard, conceive unsaid: I will it so. Dishonourable ways can never lead To honourable issues. Uthred, I charge you Follow this up no further. NORTHUMBERLAND. I, my lord, Am cased in stoutest armour, a free conscience. I neither fear, nor am vindictive. EDMUND. Edric, You answer not. EDRIC. Why, my young brother, thou art O' th' sudden grown most peremptory: nay, You now but jest with me, your simple colleague, Raised by a breath, and whom a breath can level. There was an open censure in your words, There was a hidden sarcasm in your eye, Which suit not our joint station: yet, I pass it Off with a smile, you see: 'twas but a banterâ The world, at least, should think so, and reflection Will make that thought your own. I bow to you, As a good liegeman to his future lord; But 'tis in private. Here we are as one, Coequal in authority; my age Poising your youthâmy hairs, with anxious thought Grey in their prime, giving a sober face To the hot promise of your unshorn cheek: So shall the purblind people be content. Yours be the place of honour, mine of toil; Enough for Edric if young Edmund deem His labours worth their best reward, his love. EDMUND. Edric, you speak unto an open heart With openness and honest seeming. Take My handâand, Uthred, yours too. Now, my lords, Be brothers once again. EDRIC. I tender mine, In full forgiving amity. There is not One whom I treasure up more faithfully In my close heart. EDMUND. No more. Lord Sigiferth, What say you of King Sweynâcomes he not hither Breathing defiance lion like? NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, so He has done before, then meanly crept away, Ashamed of his false spring. SIGIFERTH. A deadly rancour Now fills him. On his way he met his daughter, The wrong'd Gunilda, in her flight; who told In some short words her piteous tale, then died. On her cold body they have pledged an oath Of vengeance. EDRIC. And these ravens will have prey; So ends your logic, lordâspoke like a Dane. And now to council: but, remember all, Wisdom is secret. NORTHUMBERLAND. Wellâto council. Yet Our argument, methinks, lies in its scabbard; And thus I would advance it! [Half drawing his sword. EDRIC. In that hand It is indeed most cogent. But, methinks, A calculating head may here outweigh The vigour of an arm. I sayâto council! [Exeunt. The Apartment of Edric. Edric alone. EDRIC. Oh fool! that knowing not thyself, know'st nought! What am I, that an idiot's jeer should shake The equipoise that marks the master mind? I that have pass'd o'er faction's wildest sea As a proud galley, tossing from my stem The darkest tempest surge, as easily As Pleasure's banner'd bark, from her smooth side, Scatters the light foam of a summer wave; Shall I, I swerve from my true course, to shun This hollow frothy bubble of the North? Shame! is't not ever thus the chafing eddies Boil, fret, and bubble, in the wake of Greatness? I am not wont to meet those crosses:âay Unwelcome monitors! ye speak to me Of fleeting power, decaying fame, lost influence, And all those nameless horrors that assail A favourite in his fall: and therefore quails My spirit 'neath Opinion's steadfast eye. King Ethelred! ere many days are pass'd, Death will release thee from my nets; so be it: Cannot another web, as finely spun, Suffice to snare another royal moth? And soâha! ha! by heaven, I hate myself For nursing the base thoughtâonce more must I Resume the flatterer's trade, and to the son Kneel, fawn, lie, pander, worship, and betray As erst, with toil mechanical, I truckled, And won, and ruled the father?âCornwall!â'tis wellâ Now will I try thy mettle. Enter Cornwall. CORNWALL. My lord, I trust the presence of a friend May not be held intrusion. EDRIC (after a pause). Gentle Cornwall, Excuse these wandering thoughts. Sorrow hath thrown A cloud across as firm a brow ere now. CORNWALL. Now, may they perishâ EDRIC. Nay, my grief is not That lying lips have licence in a court; Or, that a fool, in presence of his peers, Unchid, may spit his venom on the wise; And yet, it is because such things may be, When hearts and hands united most are needed, I mourn for my devoted country. Ay, The foe is now on horse that must be metâ CORNWALL. By babbling greybeards, and a schoolboy king! EDRIC (keenly regarding him). Lord Ethelmar! what say you?âcan a man Who by his foe is stricken on the cheek, Present the other to the blowâand smileâ And squeeze the hand that wrought the shame on him? CORNWALL. Your father Abbot will cry ay,âand cite you Texts writ by hands that never held a sword. EDRIC. Shall a man dwell in fellowship with men (Cornwall is none of such) who, when a friend Is baited by a cur, lend him no aid, But preachâ'tis philosophic to endure? Shall subjects owe allegiance, nor receive Protection? CORNWALL. If, my lord, I might, unchidden, Unfold the secret map of troubled thought, And body forth the pictures of the heart To the true friend that can aright peruse them, Then would I surmise (but with deference, Such as good men feel touching sacred things) What med'cine best might reach those public ills, And heal our private wrongs. EDRIC. You hesitate; Speakâand speak fearlessly. CORNWALL. I pause, my lord, Not doubting mine own honesty, not doubting Th' expediency of that which my true heart, Faithful in its allegiance to its friend, (The best allegiance nature owns) makes manifest; But jealous, lest I touch not in your bosom An answering chord. I pauseâ EDRIC. Speak, fearlessly. CORNWALL (kneeling). The evils which have wrung Duke Edric's heart King Edric may redeem. EDRIC. My lord!âhow say you? The skill is hazardous that probes men's minds. Beware!âif you judge wrong, you do a wrong That cautious wisdom should avenge; but if Rightly you surmiseâhe that shuts such dreams, As you now give a body to, within The deep and gloomy shadows of the mind, May not be thankful that rash hands should drag The pallid monsters from their den. CORNWALL. Forgive This rashâ EDRIC (hastily). Dear Ethelmar! the human soul Is a more sensitive and plastic thing, Apt to temptation, ductile in desire, Than the monks picture when they people hell. Art thou their fiend? thus, with a breath, to give A palpable shape to that which else had slept The dim abortion of the imperfect mind. Ye wild suggestions! desperate hopes!âSay, where, Where is that fatal fire within mine eyeâ Where is that black corruption on my skinâ Where that o'erboiling of the feverish heart, Rushing in venom to the parched lip, That thus presumptuously thou tempt'st me, tearing Phantom Ambition from his cloudy home, To clothe him in my mortal garb?âOh, sir, How easy 'tis to wake this spectreâhow Impossible to lay the fiend to rest! Ay, he will live, live as fiends live, on blood! Nor hecatombs may sate his wolfish maw! CORNWALL. My lord!âmy liege!â EDRIC. Ay, so it isâproceedâ Woo coy desire, with soft, seductive words; Pamper imaginationâand so steal Warm on the fainting heart, and thenânay, speak not; I will not addâbetray. Cornwall, I'll trust thee: Yet rashly hast thou ravish'd confidence. On thy head be the sin. CORNWALL. On my head rest it! And, as I prove myself thy bane or weal, Welcome the weight, whether it come allied With the keen axe, or sparkling coronet! EDRIC. Thy hand, Duke Ethelmar!âthy hand. It is, Indeed, an easy thing to dream of crowns, And fancy vision'd sceptres in the graspâ But how to compass them?â CORNWALL. It may be done. EDRIC. By many roads men may accomplish greatness: Some have stol'n bashful to the tardy throne; Some, with a nobler grasp, rent the bright bauble From the smooth brow of silken royalty, Scorning to crush a form so impotent; Some, with glaived hand, have, in the front of battle, Shook their proud banner, dared the world in arms, And ruled with iron what they won with steel; Some have, with noiseless step, and vizar'd features, Cloak'd in th' accomplice gloom of ruffian night, Crept to the couch of sleeping power, and sped Th' unwary dreamer to the dreamless grave; Someâno, no,ânone of theseâI am not yet So steep'd in the intoxicating cup, That I must quaff, howe'er the draught be spiced. Cornwallâwhy speak you not? CORNWALL. I wait, my lord, To learn, not prompt, your will. EDRIC. Indeed? CORNWALL. Nay, moreâ Whate'er it be, to forward as I may. EDRIC. 'Tis well. CORNWALL. You are wedded to the royal bloodâ EDRIC. Proceed. CORNWALL. The people know your rule. EDRIC. They ought: It has been felt. CORNWALL. The king is dying. EDRIC. But Bequeathing to the realm two prosperous youths, Heirs to his kingdom, and our love. CORNWALL. It may be The people shall respect his legacy In such sort as they note his living will; And deem Duke Edric, or Queen Emmaâ EDRIC. Wherefore Link you our names? CORNWALL. My lord, if once again I touch a string that vibrates, pardon me. But many minds have mated you ere now: Nay, there have been lips that have whisper'd treason (When you are named together) 'gainst the zeal Wherewith her grace hath watch'd the nuptial lamp.â EDRIC. Forbear, my lord of Cornwall! If, as you say, And truly, that I love, such ribald trifling With a loved name suits not the past; still less Chimes with the future. CORNWALL. I offend no more. I would have said, my lord, and now will say, There are, among our nobles, men who recognize Queen Emma's beauty and Duke Edric's wisdom, And may be wrought upon to wish them mated. The public weal's at stake: a foreign foe, The Danish raven, that from far had smelt That carnage of Saint Briceâ(Start not, my lord, The retrospect is needful) the base carrion Hath lured this bird of prey unto our vitals, Where he would gorge, as his forefathers have. Look at the state! 'tis, as the king who rules it, Upon the brink of a sure grave: in idiot Apathy wrapp'd up, or childish terror, As each event succeeds: afraid to trust, Yet impotent to act: without a leader, (For shall a beardless boy degrade the title?) Unless (albeit with gentle violence) The hand, so long our secret guide, shall boldly Assume the vacant helm; and rule of right That which is his by merit. EDRIC. Flatterer!â Yet is the scene thou sketchest a true picture; A fore-ground rough, beneath a turbid sky, Opening in glory to a golden distanceâ Yet, oh, how far remote! CORNWALL. Not to the bold. Plume thy stout shoulders, even with dÃ¦mons wings, And thou shalt clear the barrier. Let us reflect. The younger of the royal spawn, that churl, As in their infinite contempt men style Prince Edwy, may, like any worthless weed, Be flung to any dunghill; but his brother, Edmund, hath qualities that royally Endow a stripling form. Ay, though as wild A gallant as e'er rifled female lips; Ardent as colt that never felt the bit; Tameless as greyhound first from collar slipp'd; Fierce as a falcon cast upon the wind; He has, withal, th' exterior attributes That mark high birth, high spirit, and great deeds. The brow whereon throned Wisdom sits; the eyes From whose twin orbs the glorious brethren glance, Valour and Mercy; the sweet mouth whose smile Wins, like the spirit of love, by unseen paths, Upon the inmost heart.â EDRIC. 'Sdeath! what's to me His beauties, or his virtues, or his vices? Why talk you thus? CORNWALL. To stamp one grinding truth Into your soul: to bear it down upon you, With all th' emphatic force, weight, pain,âthat fear, Relentless hate, and jealousy may heap, Like coals of fire, upon your aching brain:â For one inevitable evil clogs Your path, that mustâ EDRIC. Good oracle, I will Anticipate your fiatâmust be removed. But how, good time and Cornwall may suggest. CORNWALL. Trust me. EDRIC. I will. And now we separate. Our conference may breed suspicion. Haply Men's eyes are on us: be discreetâI feel, Thus on the eve of greatness, more disturb'd Than in my worst obscurity. Farewellâ Each to his labour; thou to sound the depths Of popular opinion; I to weigh Men's character and opportunity. [Exit Cornwall. EDRIC. Cornwall! thou art mine own; bound by such links As shall compel thee to my will; whilst I Am free. 'Tis ever thus the master-genius Subdues the meaner slaves of crime, and works His hidden course with mole-like instruments. Now Cornwall plumes his airy nothingness, And makes the trusty wind his confidant, How he has worm'd stern Edric's heart, and 'stablish'd Himself i' the post of most obsequious jackal To the roused lion. Let him think so. Men Who try these dangerous ventures, do well to give The lead in guilt to such free myrmidons: So are they shielded from the worst, should worst Befal: or, should a prosperous cast be thrown, May sweep the stakes up with a smiling face, Tossing to menial guilt the common fee. Men too are zealous, deeming that they play A swelling part, and bustle through the scene, Giving in energy what lacks in grace. Cornwall! take then thy station at mine ear, And deem thyself a dÃ¦mon's minister: A name shall not affright me from my purpose. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART THE SECOND. THE INTRIGUERS. The Palace in London. Enter Edmund, Northumberland, Bulloign. EDMUND. Ha! ha!âNow, Bulloign, had I been born a pagan, As, in my conscience, I'm disposed to think Our father confessor hath bred me one, I should convince you, by such precedents, Drawn from authentic tales of ancient writ, That, when I kneel to such a shape as hers I have romanced away this hour in painting, There is much reason in idolatry. Why, brother, she,âI say againâ BULLOIGN. I grant you, Without again retouching a fair picture, That she is beautiful, and may be chaste. EDMUND. May! why she is; or I should hate her. BULLOIGN. Soâ As you have tried, or will, I grant it: but, sir, Take heed: this wife, or daughter, of old Sigiferth,â (No matter which)âthis miracleâthis paragonâ May, like the caged bird, well be credited For a most wanton wish to fly at large. Nay, rob not the old pigeon of his mate. EDMUND. Absurd! you have not seen her. Wives will have An air that shows the matron, staid and comely; Collected in their virtue, as becomes such Who, knowing what vice may be, can restrain it; A wide benignity of eye, that smiles (Like mother Nature in her gentlest mood) With the soft gaze of pleased maternity, On all around that's good. But she I wot of Has all the virgin's shyness, and her foot A fawn-like elasticity, that suits not Forms that have been the shrine of infant life. She is the mountain flower, whom never eye Hath mark'd but mine, and never hand shall gather From its sweet nest but mine. No moreâLord Edric. Leave us together. NORTHUMBERLAND. Why will you trust that man? EDMUND. Aha! you 've not forgot your fencing match I' the council yester eve. Eustace, how think you? Play'd not the Duke of Mercia his foil well? Methinks he touch'd my Lord Northumberland Once and again: 'twas well the point was hooded. BULLOIGN. Hush! EDMUND. Pshaw! I care not.â[To Edric, entering.]âGentle potentate! Cousin of Mercia! most renown'd co-regent! How fares your grace? I have just pluck'd the sleeve Of memory, for these lords, touching that feat Of prowess, wherewith you surprised the court Last night. BULLOIGN. Dear madcap coz, adieu! We may not The ear of needful business intercept. Good day, my lord of Mercia. [Exeunt Bulloign and Northumberland. EDMUND. Brother Edric, There seem'd in that fastidious bow, and smile Of, how shall I name it, supercilious meekness, Feelings far alien to a brother's heart. How's this?âI would have concord. EDRIC. You shall command Whate'er you willâmy heart: but pardon me, If somewhat yet of chill clings to my spirit. The earliest ice will skin the scalded cup. You summon'd me? EDMUND. Ay, to as light a council As ever prince call'd minister. I love. You smile; and think 'twere well to talk of war, Canute, and those most waspish Danes. Observe me; I am prepared for all; and, sans advice, Have ta'en such steps as shall affright these Danes. But 'twas not that I sought to speak onâlove, Love is my theme to-day, and shall this night Be my best business. You must aid me. EDRIC. I?â EDMUND. Ay, sage viceregent! but seek not with whom. Let me have masquers, minstrels, poetsâall Who best may give night serenades a zest. Know you Lord Sigiferthâthe Dane? You seem Surprised. EDRIC (aside). What! love another's wife?âa Dane's? And seek her? This breeds mischief.â(Aloud.)âAy, my lord, The dotard who has married the young wifeâ EDMUND. Should be consulted?âshould he not? Th' emergency Pressesâhe is a Dane, and yet most trusty: A noble of much weight, and wisely gifted. EDRIC (aside). Prince Edwy, too, lays his suit here. Even brothers May not, in love, be bloodless rivals. EDMUND. Fie! Your apprehension's dull. 'Twere well, methinks, To call this lord to conference: he will Be flatter'd, and detain'd, tillâ EDRIC. 'Till the jewel He loves is filch'd from him? EDMUND. You know me not. Govern your forward fancy more discreetly. EDRIC. My will is yours alone. When purpose you To try th' adventure? EDMUND. When the moon first rises. EDRIC. That will be nine. EDMUND. No later. I must feed My midnight lamp with studious oil, and forfeit To th' public weal my rest; but, first, would gladly Strike from the flinty edge of care one spark Of perishable joy. EDRIC. You are determined? EDMUND. Fully. EDRIC. My lord, reflectâit is my duty. EDMUND. Nay, Talk on; I have made up my mind. Say, therefore, E'en what you will. Deal you in most sage saws, I shall most merrily interpret them. EDRIC. I know my duty, princeâbut love for you Hoodwinks my judgment. EDMUND. Oh, no doubt, no doubtâ No more of that. EDRIC. Will you not name your lady?â She is some flaring, summer-dighted dame, Ambling through love's hot atmosphere, and turning Her throbbing bosom to young Cupid's beams, As to yon sun the flower that bears his name. I would I knew how deep this shaft hath sped; [Aside. How keenly barb'd. EDMUND. Thou libeller of beauty! EDRIC. I know not that. What stature bears she?âsay What colour on her cheek?âfair as the morning? Is that the tint? or beautiful as night; Around whose umber'd brow the opal moon Gathers a diamond diadem of stars?â Where is your limner's skill? EDMUND. How should I paint her? By what quaint alchemy could I distil Tints of aerial delicacy, such As Iris arches o'er a summer shower, To sketch the evanescent charms that wander About her beautiful presence! EDRIC. Thus 'tis ever With beautyâperfect, as love. EDMUND. Nay, 'tis not The grace of her meek, bending, snowy neck; The delicate budding of her tender bosom, Above a waist a stripling's hand might compass; The flowing outline of proportion'd limbs, Moving with health's elastic lightness, blent With all that nameless suavity of air That marks high birth; 'tis not, alone, a face Whose features are all symmetry; an eye In whose etherial blue Love sits enshrined, A spirit in a star; cheeks eloquent In changeful blushes, as her sweetest lips In the harmonious utterance of pure thoughts: 'Tis not all theseâthe palpable ornaments Of the material mould, love's pageantry Floating o'er beauty's surface (as the galley That, in its proud trim, bore the Egyptian queen Along the rosy-tinted waves, reflecting The blazon of that mock divinity): No, no! it is not these that win my heart: But 'tis the pure intelligence of mind That, like some inborn light, beams from her soul; The virtuous thoughts, that clothe her as a garment; The chastity, the candour, and the meekness, That, through her parted hair, look from a brow And features, where the seal of heaven is set! Oh, Edric! 'tis, in truth, a countenance Whereon a saint might look, loving yet passionless; A record of philosophy; a page Where Wisdom might peruse and learn, as in A leaf of holy writ. EDRIC. Draw breath, fair brother! This is, indeed, to be enamour'dâbut True as the portrait may be, is it quite In character? What hope you from aâwifeâ Suiting your rhapsody? EDMUND. A wife!âby Heaven! You all are in one plot to madden me. I love the daughter, not the wife. EDRIC. Cry mercy! Heaven speed your wooing! So, as yet, you have not Whisper'd what ladies love to hear? EDMUND. I have But gazedâand gazed: yet can I read the heart In the fair superscription of the face; And all I name I pledge myself she is. EDRIC. Whate'er you please; I shall believe it all. And you, here, aimâ EDMUND. No matter what my aim is. At nineâremember. Ho! Lord Edricâhearkenâ Be in my chamber, ere to-morrow's sun: We shall have need of counselâtrusty and wise. Till then, farewell! [Exit Edmund. EDRIC. I do begin to think there's virtue in My new ambition; Fate so leagues herself Accomplice to my will. The brothers woo One mistressâprosperously may they woo! It is a charitable wish, and likely To yield contentment, 'till each knows his wrong. What then?âAm I to blame, should accident, Or overweening zeal, tear off the bandage From either's eyes; and if ('tis natural) Evil should grow of this, and, from the heart, Wherein 'tis 'gender'd, travel to the hand? Let me consider.âThis course is too slow. To-night this gallant visits his unknown, (For such she seems to him) this Algitha, Late wedded to her guardian, Sigiferth; In some fantastic freak of age, men say, Churlish to watch what it may not enjoy. This maiden, too, hath caught the eye of Edwy; And he is savage in his appetite. What if both choose one moment for one suit? What if both meet in rageâcan I help that? What if one slay the otherâis't my fault? At least 'twill be my gain whate'er befal. Shall I not turn it in my thought?âI will. In that there's risk to none. [Exit. The open Country. Enter Canute, Gothmund, Turkill, Anlaffe, and Suite. CANUTE. Thus far my father's wishes are fulfill'd, And our lance quivers in fair England's heart. Earl Gothmund, bear these tidings to the king, Whose age-worn frame, and sorrow-stricken soul, Need such refreshment: you may say thus farther, That plots, now ripening, promise early fruit: We gain alike by battle or by parley. GOTHMUND. I go, my lord. [Exit Gothmund. CANUTE. Turkill, this enemy, Marshall'd by youths, bear them right cautiously. TURKILL. Our spies report, the sons of Ethelred, And the co-regent Duke of Mercia, Still haunt the court, leaving to graver heads The toils of war. CANUTE. Methinks, Northumberland Had shown more soldiership, had he maintain'd Yon hill's bold brow some hours. Flank'd by that river, We durst not have affronted his main battle. TURKILL. Cornwall, who, as Duke Edric's creature, holds High influence o'er their councils, writes to me, That, by Prince Edmund's order, who allows No second in command, they may not hazard One doubtful field, till join'd by his new levies, Which are immediate. Young as he is, methinks Your grace will find no worthless foe in Edmund. CANUTE. Such is my trust. I have not given my youth A scholarship of arms, to waste my prime In tilting for a pastime; or, in blunting My sword on silken-coated chamber-gallants. I would do something that, while it serves the state, May, for itself, be worth a memory: Something of prowess in the shock of steel; Or the wise combinations of plann'd fields, Where thought does more than weapon; or repute For skill in conduct of successful plots, Where the pen saves the sword a world of blood. TURKILL. We soldiers, good my lord, would rather wade, Even to the knees, in blood, than toil a league Of a rough road to avoid it. Yet, I own, Plots promise well; perhaps at lighter risk. CANUTE. Cornwall is Mercia's friend. How well I hate That man thou know'st: yet, in this game we play Deep stakes, and must, though prompt, be cautious still. If, by to-morrow's sunset, we can force No 'vantage in the field, we then essay A wilier game. What think you? Ethelred May his last hour gladly absolve from care, And leave th' adjustment of our difference To the arbitrement of umpires: I Would not reject, and he will name Duke Edric. TURKILL. Why, 'tis a hopeful scheme: impediment I can see noneâsave, in your vow of vengeance. CANUTE. That shall be kept; but may be kept as surely In future council as this battle-field. YesâI will meet, with a sheath'd sword, this Edric Now; 'tis my policy:âthe instant welfare Of kings and nations rest upon my conduct. In private quarrel these shall not be peril'd. TURKILL. A surer time may come. CANUTE. A sure time shall comeâ My oath is register'd. But, first, my arm Must, from his throne, pluck down this bloody Saxon, Whose crown a Dane shall wear more gloriously. Then, Edric, at thy heart!âbut not i' th' dark. I shall strike at thee in an open fieldâ Then give thy forfeit limbs to feed the crow. Now, nobles, for the present be it your care To plume our squadrons for the morrow's sun, As if we had no thought but to display Our prowess 'neath his eye. Meantime, within My tent, will I, with slow and wary thought, Address my mind to either chance.âDepart. [Exeunt severally. The Garden of Sigiferth. Enter Edmund. EDMUND. This is the gateâsoftlyâay, there 's her chamber. The light looks from her casement on the moon, With a red eye, as one who watches. See! What passes o'er the window?ânow 'tis goneâ And now (her own sweet shade, as 'twere a spirit, Gracing this lonely hour) 'tis come again. How beautiful, to one who loves, is such A night as this! breathless as he who stills His heart to catch love's sigh, dearer than words. No sound of life disturbs the air:âthe moon Sits in her cloudy temple; like a priestess, White-stoled, and radiant with the inward light Of wisdom, holy thoughts, most pure desires, And dreams that hold her in community With yon angelic choir, whose sounding spheres Peal hymns of adoration, through the depths Of the calm, boundless, and eternal heaven! Most soothing are the thoughts great Nature breathes Into the human soul!âas if from heaven, Upon the altar of the heart, direct, A purer flame descended, there to light Th' accepted sacrifice! How blest art thou, Love, in thy garb of purity! how base In all thy meretricious braveries! Thou art the blossom of the heart, that heralds A various fruitage: some, like dead-sea apples, That break in bitter dust within the lips; Some, of a cloying sweetness, which leave after A legacy of sickening qualms; some pungent, That stimulate the craving sense, then pall it; But some have such blest flavour, wholesome substance, That appetite, unsated, still returns; As love's requital makes us doubly love. She moves again, between the light and windowâ How gracefully her shadow bends! and now Her arm is raisedâhaply, to loose her tresses, And fling them forth, a fountain of bright ringlets, As waters round a statue. Come, sweet music! Carry love's soul into her ear, and witch her Unto my suit. Hist, hist! ye laggart minstrels! Where do ye linger? [He steps aside. Enter Edwy and Osmer. EDWY. Nay, nay! I might have any woman so. I would not love her, knave, beyond a week. Ha! see you there, whom Edric told me of? My blood's on fire. [Catching at his dagger. OSMER. Think of her husband, prince. EDWY. A sly gift to the church may absolve much. See! here he comes again! Hell blister him! Bastard, wilt thou stand by me? OSMER. Prove me. EDWY. By hell! The villain tempts me strangely. Enter Sigiferth, cloaked. He knocks at the door. SIGIFERTH. Algitha! EDWY. His fancy is already in her chamberâ Damn him! [Edwy and Osmer assail Sigiferth. EDWY. Hot liver! take this to thy core! SIGIFERTH. Oh! I am slain. ALGITHA (rushing out in terror). Help! help! EDWY. Sweet mistressâpr'ythee! Thou shalt have usage such as ladies love. Nay, then, I 'll stop your mouth with kisses. Enter Edmund, from behind. EDMUND. Fiend! Whoe'er thou art, defend thyself! Unhand The lady! Look to thy life. EDWY (aside). My brother's voice! Osmer, upon him! [They both fight with Edmund. Osmer flies. EDWY. Coward!âHold, Edmund, hold! I'm wounded to the death! EDMUND. What!âspeak again. Lights there!âwhat ho!âhold up thy head!âwho art thou? My brother?âsay not that thou art my brother. EDWY. Leave me!âbegone! Enter Edric, and Attendants with torches. EDRIC. What means this broil? (Aside). By death! The churl it is that's hurt. EDMUND. Turn down your torches: Lift not night's pall from such a sight as this. Edric, the dÃ¦mons have been loosed on earth, And ta'en men's shapes, and wrought such bloody pranks As should draw down th' avenging lightnings. See How to the bloody corse of Sigiferth Yon weeping woman clings. There lies my brother, Smote in his crime by an unconscious hand, A brother's handâhis blood is on my sword. See here! and on my head, and in my heart. Oh, Edwy! EDWY. Touch me not! avaunt! I am Revived again! Lord Edric, take me hence. EDMUND. Brother! your hand. EDWY (to EDRIC). Your arm, sir; lead me hence. [Exit Edwy with Edric. EDMUND (to ALGITHA). Lady, permit a friend, who loved your father, Gently to draw you from this scene. ALGITHA. My father! Oh, yes! he was a father to me. Sigiferth! My husband! my poor husband! EDMUND. Sacred Heaven! Lady, forgive, that IâThou bleeding clay Forgive, that even in thought I wrong'd thee. Lady, How may I serve thee? ALGITHA. Oh, had you known him, sir, And seen how fondly from my infancy He cherish'd me; and, when the world grew strong In wickedness around me, gave in his age The Ã¦gis of an honour'd name and house To shield my friendless, maiden helplessness. EDMUND. Oh, say no moreâ ALGITHA. And can I view him now, Defaced by murder's ruthless hand, nor feel My desolation, and his fate?âMy husband! Friend! father! pardon that I think of aught Than this, thy breathless clayâoh misery! EDMUND. Pray you permit that, with a friendly force, I draw you from this sorrow. Sirs, take up These poor remains; and to Saint Stephen's bear them. I shall take charge that honourable rites And holy masses grace his sepulture. Lady, I shall but lead you to your home, And so commit you to your handmaid's care. [Exeunt severally. The Palace in London. Enter Edmund, Edric, Bulloign, &amp;c. EDMUND. My lord of Mercia, I insist you waive This topic. Whilst in my hand lies deputed The sceptre, I will grasp it as a sword. EDRIC. I do but urge your father's express will, The weakness of the timesâfair policyâ EDMUND. Away with policy! and, for the times, Our firmness and unshrinking will shall nerve The puny muscles of misrule. I bow, As doth become a son, with filial sorrow, Before a father's weakness; but, as a prince, A patriot, and a man, I dare to think And act as may advantage our poor countryâ Albeit amenable to cavilling fools Touching this charge of disobedience. Gentlemen, Who feel as Englishmen should feel, already Have three most precious weeks vainly been wasted In this most aimless conference. EDRIC. Sir,â EDMUND. Speak not! I'll have no more on't. Bulloign, to horse! and bear My orders to Northumberland and Cornwall, That by to-morrow's sun, on Ashdown field, Our power stand militant. Before the dawn I shall be at their head. BULLOIGN. I haste, my prince; And with a light heart shall essay the journey, Bearing such worthy tidings. [Exit Bulloign, attended. EDMUND. Edric, I take Your hand, in pledge that with no angry thought Do I reject your well-meant counsel. Further, I here commit to your fraternal care That dearest hope I hold on earth, the beautiful, The virtuous, and, though widow'd, virgin Algitha. She knows that with no selfish aim I strive To win her from past grief. She shall be mineâ Your eye falls from me. EDRIC (aside). Dolt! I have conjured up Nought but despair by my vain plots. The death Of Sigiferth hath help'd him to a wife, Me to new crimes. Shall I proceedâor pause? EDMUND. Why muse you? EDRIC. Thoughts, my lord, are very worthless. So, when the stress of battle comes, my station Is with weak woman and a death-bed! Take My sword; a distaff, or a crucifix, Suit better my new dignity. EDMUND. I seek not Aught so unworthy of your character. Your Mercian levies, and the tardier Angles, (Who with strong bit and sharp spur must be ruled), To your experience we commit. Though somewhat Of loiterers on the skirts of our main battle, They shall well back us in to-morrow's fight. Take, then, this post, as one of honour: trust me, A firm mind and a skilful never yet Were more in need. We purpose to enact That which may ask prompt succour. Are you content? EDRIC. Of force I must be. EDMUND. Now, to thee, fair Algitha, I shall but whisper one soft wordâand thenâ I must not dwell on this. Commend me, Edric, Unto the queen; and, though her love for me Be scant, tell her, whate'er betide, there lives not A heart more firm in honourable faith To her, and her fair children. [Exit Edmund. EDRIC. The scale of fate is in my hands again! Hope breathes once more! Who waits? Enter a Servant. Send to my chamber The Earl of Cornwall's messenger. My pact Shall with the Dane be keptâthough yet my claim Upon Northumbria be in suspense. Should Edmund lose to-morrow's day?âWhy, then, I hold the key, by whose most cunning wards Empire within these turrets is shut in. To-morrow! ay, that is the staff I lean on; Round whose charm'd stem, as o'er a wizard's wand, The serpent, Hope, coils up his glittering folds. Adieu to Edmund, should that day be lost; And that he wins it not be it my care. Edwy!âthou art an ill weed in my path, From whence some poisonous drug may be distill'd. Thou hast a venom rankling in thy veins Which a false tongue hath breathed into thy sense Of that chance blow, dealt by a brother's hand. I'll prompt him to some post of trust to-morrow, And with a hawk's-eye watch the flight of chance. The king will soon be dead: brief be, thereafter, Thy widow's weeds, fair Emma! I know no guardian More worthy of thy royal brood than I. Oh! trust me in thy dove-cote, I shall be As plausible a fox as ever wiled Bold chanticleer from roost; and, for a kite, The mildest bird that ever stoop'd to feather. So, welcome Power; and guide me to a gem Of a yet brighter and more royal water! Now wend I to the queen. Unholy love! DÃ¦mon ambition! in your fiercest flames Kindle your torches; and, upon my tongue, And in her heart, pour all your subtlest fires, To win a jealous woman to my will! [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART THE THIRD. THE TRAITORS. The Palace in London. Queen Emma and Edric. EMMA. Rise, my lord, riseânay, Edric. EDRIC. To the earth My knees shall grow, unless those angel lips Shall tell me that my daring suit is pardon'd. EMMA. Women are used to pardon such. EDRIC. And that My love in that soft bosom breeds no hateâ EMMA. We do not hate because we are loved. EDRIC. Say, further, (Thou queen, whose empire is the boundless heart Of universal man, whose unbought homage Clings aye to the triumphant shrine of beauty) Should not love's service have reward? I seek In your eyes, only, a replyâone lookâ One only lookâI ask no moreâbut such As on her love the wellâwoo'd Helen cast When Venus led her to his pillowâsuch As stung boy Gyges, when the Asian queen Clung to his heart, in vengeance that her lord Had, in his doting vanity, unveil'd To eyes profane all her mysterious beautiesâ Beauties, that vainly the fond bath clung round With its enamour'd waters, as she cower'd Beneath its lucid veil, a snowy pearl, Set in a sparkling zone of chrysoliteâ Look thus!âlook thus! EMMA. Thou dangerous tempter! leave me. I dare not look. EDRIC. I thank thee for that âdare not.â Thus let me pleadâ EMMA. Stand off, my lord; the king Yet breathes: my faith is his: respect his death-bed. EDRIC. But, when that obstacle no more shall bar us, Wilt thou?âNo answer! EMMA. Feel how I tremble. EDRIC. Thus, Upon thy hand, I seal a lover's thanks. EMMA. Another time. Let me withdraw: anon We'll talk of thisâ EDRIC. And, by my hopes, in love! Which do so far outweigh all wordly wishes, That all thy feet, glorying, I lay them down, (Without one pledge from thee, save buoyant hope). Here I abjure all thoughts that chime not with The concord of your thoughts, all interests Save those you point me toâso help me Heaven! EMMA. The only gift I now may yield is hope. With that I thank you: nay, nay, look not so, Or you will frighten me again. Remember, (If that, indeed, may be a prize worth noting) He wins not Emma's hand who sets no crown On her son's brow. EDRIC. These words have slain two princes! Adieu! my beautifulâoh! might I add A fonder nameâmy own! [Exit Edric. EMMA. He's gone.âMy beating heart!âI've dared too much. I do not know myself.âHow hot my cheek is! I may not trust myself again, alone, With this most guilty, most persuasive Edric.â âFreely I breathe again.âWhat have I said? Enoughâhaply, too much:âno; let him hopeâ For hope may be a virtue, or a viceâ A bane, or cordial, as we tend its growth: Nor am I bound to play the monitor. âI have not knownâI must not trustâmyself. Shall I, then, pause?âI will not; for the stake At which I throw is empire for my child. This duke must be restrain'd; yet, in such wise, That, pledging him, I may not stand committed, In heart, in act, in fame: so may I win His services unharm'd, and meet, unblemish'd, The proud eye of Canute.âWhy does my mind Dwell on Canute for ever? May it not be, That a shrewd eye shall, at a glance, pierce through The kindred thoughts of kindred policy; And mutual interest form a silent tie Valid as love, attractive as desire? Oh, I have dared too much this day. T' accomplish My aim, I must be cautious; nor expose A human heart to superhuman trial. [Exit. The Field of Ashdown. Enter Edmund, Bulloign, and Officers, armed. EDMUND. The loitering sun is up at last; and all The dew-bred vapours, that now shroud fair earth, With their wreath'd masses, soon will underarch The azure cope of heaven. 'Tis well, methinks: Our toil will be the lighter in the shade. Bulloign! brave comrades all! are our stout ranks Marshall'd as we concerted? BULLOIGN. All, my lord. EDMUND. Right.âAnd we now may recapitulate The scheme of this day's charge. [He unfolds a scroll. Enter Edwy. Ha!âbrother Edwy? It warms my heart to see thee. Why, this argues A gallant soul, to leave thy bed of sickness For the rough usage of the field. EDWY. I beg A boon. EDMUND. It shall be granted. EDWY. I demand To lead the vanguard of the field. EDMUND. Dear brother, It may not be: yet, 'tis not that I doubt Thy courage, or thy skill. Northumberland Already is possess'd of our designs, Which time permits not I again develope. âYet now, methinks, I have a post will suit you. [To Bulloign. My lord of Bulloign, for short space I must Absolve your shoulders from a load, that now This panting gallant shall take up.âFair brother, [To Edwy. Wilt thou, in this day's fight, command the escort That guards our person? Be assured 't will be (We'll make it so) the post of danger. EDWY. Sir, Albeit unworthy of my rank, I take it: Here, I presume, my duty isâobedience. BULLOIGN. Then step aside with me, my lord, one moment, Till I instruct you in the dangerous duties Of your most precious charge. [Bulloign and Edwy walk apart. Enter an Officer, in haste. EDMUND. What means this breathless haste?âyour news? OFFICER. My lord, The enemy's on horse, already pushing His heavy march through the hedged valleys, threatening Our right battalion's flank. EDMUND. Treason!âmy lords! The foe anticipates us. Ho! with speed, Ride some one to my lord of Cornwall; charge him Not to abate his vantage-ground one inch, 'Till we support him with fresh troops. Enter Morcar. Good Morcar, Thou 'rt from the right;âwhat hast thou seen? Is't true The foe so stoutly dares us? MORCAR. Ay, my lord! By heaven, I think they sweep in their array Like an arm'd tempest. I beheld their bands Bristling the horizon of that ample plain, With all their spear-shafts glittering in the sun, Even as a gloomy thunder-cloud that hurtles His arrowy shower athwart a summer sky, Slanting before the golden setting sun. EDMUND. My blood 's on fire! To horse! Morcar, with speed Betake thee to our left, and, if Northumberland Be not return'd, direct who next commands To wheel his force, as arrows from the bow, And charge whate'er he meets. By Egbert's heart! We'll burst upon the traitors in their march. [Exit Morcar. Enter Northumberland. EDMUND. How now, Earl Uthred?âwhy not at your post? What of my fatherâis his grace well? NORTHUMBERLAND (kneeling). My liege! First, as thy faithful subject, let me kneel, And cryâLong live King Edmund! EDMUND. What, sir?âAlas! My father! my poor father! Oh! had he none To close, with filial love, his dying eyes! Named he his son, good Uthred? sped he one blessing Towards him, not combating for life alone, But for his country's fame and freedom NORTHUMBERLAND. Yes, He loved you to the last, and call'd you oft The prop of his decaying hours, the shield Of our degraded country. Oh, my liege, Before the breath quite left him, your sad father Muster'd his dying thoughts, and, being revived Some moments by kind cordials, faintly look'd Round, and so piteously assail'd our hearts, With sighs, and tears, and self-accusing words, That we, who watch'd by him that fatal hour, Could scarce contain ourselves for grief. EDMUND. Oh, sir, Repeat the precious words he utter'd. Why, Why was I absent! NORTHUMBERLAND. 'Twas of poor England, chiefly, He spoke; the prize, the prey, of ev'ry foe; Rent by the earthquakes of domestic wars; Uprooted by false traitors; by weak friends Abandon'd, and himself the weakest. Then He wept afresh, and chid himself. âI see âThat God,â he cried, âhath turn'd from us: our battle âIs weaken'd by revolt! our trusted friends âBetray our counsel, or stand out for terms âOf most dishonourable peace. For me, sirsâ âPoor Ethelred, the Unreadyâhere behold me, âOnly prepared, at last, to dieâto die âOh, days of England's mourning! struck to earth âAlike by friends or foesâcrush'd like the grain âBetwixt two mighty millstones. Land of sorrow! âYour date is pastâyour great renown extinctâ âYour sceptre in the grasp of foreign handsâ âYour throat laid bare unto a foreign sword!â He spoke but little after, and then swoon'dâ Reviv'dâthen dozedâand waken'd once again, To sink into the last deep sleep of death. Enter an Officer. OFFICER. The Earl of Cornwall is in full retreat. EDMUND. Fly, Bulloign!âtake the traitor's post, and speed His soul to hell! Northumberland!âaway! And govern thee, as if all England's realm Weigh'd on our brain, and press'd us to the death! Osmer, fly thou unto the Duke of Mercia, And charge him so to expedite his march That, ere the sun hath reach'd the height of heaven, He stand on th' adverse bank of yon good ford; Holding the desperate pass, as one who strains, With clench'd teeth, bursting eyeballs, blanched lips, For masteryâfor life!âEdwy, unsheath Thy sword in thy first field; and wield it so, As if for vengeance, knowing it thy last! [Exeunt severally. Another part of the Field of Ashdown. Alarums. Enter Canute, Anlaffe, attended. ANLAFFE. Your grace, in this day's famous charge, hath so Acquitted your high valour, and sustain'd Your wonted captainship, that now your subjects Crave, as a boon, that you no more expose Your precious life to needless danger. CANUTE. Ha! Well charged, brave Turkill!âsee, how Gothmund wheels Upon their staggering flank!âHere will I rest Awhile.âWhy, ay, this Ashdown in our story Shall have a brave remembrance. Gallant Anlaffe, Well hast thou borne thee in this trialâkneel; And, though dark Mercia chafe, and gnaw the bit, Rise, Earl of Northumberland! Where are The spoils of the old Saxon lord? ANLAFFE. Behold His sword, (a broken one) and spurs, and belt. CANUTE. A braver knight, a worthier, or a wiser, Sat not on horse, or sway'd in council. ANLAFFE. He Comported him with death, as one who looks With scorn on that which he despises: striving To struggle on one knee, and feebly shaking His weaponless hand in air, he shoutedââEdmund!â âEngland!ââthen fell prone, like an oak, and died. Enter an Officer. CANUTE. Thy message?âsay? OFFICER. King Edmund still, though wounded, Fights like a stag at bay. Cornwall hath 'scaped, And pledges that the Duke of Mercia stirs not One soldier to the rescue. CANUTE. Bid him spur Unto the duke, and say, that, having won The ford, we strike at London. Unto him I do commend (should he indeed survive) The master, whom this bright day hath discrown'd. What says brave Anlaffe? ANLAFFE. Oh, my lord, to horse! By Odin! England's banner is afloat Once more, on yon hill's crest! No meaner arm May stem King Edmund's charge! CANUTE. Upon them, then! And be our cryââSaint Brice!âââGunilda's wrongs!â [Exeunt. Another part of the Field of Ashdown. Enter Edric, attended: the Earl of Cornwall. CORNWALL. With bended knee, I here salute your grace As Mercia's king, Duke of Northumbria, And guardian of fair England's realm. EDRIC. Indeed! Is Edmund slain?âhow say'st thou?âquick! CORNWALL. I know not; But do believe it well. Of this be sure; If breathing, he has not a subject now Will cry, âGod save him!ââEdwy is fall'n. EDRIC. How died he? CORNWALL. Charging with Turkill, in the foremost rank, We singled out King Edmund, who still fought, Back'd by some friends, around his household banner; Enacting deeds that well became his birth. In gloomy mood, some score yards in the rear, Prince Edwy rein'd his horse in, nor would move One man to the rescue. I could see his face Convulsed with varying passions, pale and ghastly, While his fierce troop, indignant, chafed around him; Who, when they saw the royal banner stoop, No longer might be stay'd, but onward sprung; Too late, (so well their leader's treason wrought) To snatch the doubtful wreath of victory, But timely to preserve King Edmund's life. The Churl charged with themâwhether by sense of shame Stung, or remorse, instinct of courage, love Of kindred, lingering still at heart, I know not; But, in the midst, struggling with Turkill, wrenching, With knit teeth, for the standard, I observed, And, from behind, charging at gallop, smote himâ EDRIC. What, dead?â CORNWALL (displaying his sword). Behold heart's blood was never blacker! EDRIC. IâIâ'tis well! CORNWALL. I had his head struck off, And, in its warm blood reeking, on a pole, Shouting, we bore it through the Saxon ranks, And cried, âBehold your King!â sudden, deceived By the resemblance of the brothers, fear Dispersed their bravestâBut, behold!âwhom fate Yields to your handâthe royal fugitive! Enter Edmund, wounded and fatigued. EDMUND. All lostâall lost!âthou damned Mercia! Here, consummate thy treason!âhere, in my heart! [Uncovering his bosom. Oh England! my poor country! Ha! Cornwallâtraitor!âart thou there? Thank Heaven, I yet have strength! [He rushes at, and slightly wounds, Cornwall. CORNWALL. Have at thee, crownless king! EDRIC (interposing). Hold!âThus I strike your sword down. Ethelmar, Abate your prurient zeal. Put up, my lord, Your swordâmust I repeat? Edmund, I am not The bloodhound that thou deem'st me. Question not Why I amâwhat I am? There lies a path Of safety, leading to the forest. EDMUND. Almost I hate a life, due at thy hand. [A salute of trumpets. EDRIC. Canute Comes on the instant: fly! EDMUND (as he goes out). Cornwall, remember! Enter Canute, Turkill, Anlaffe, Gothmund, attended. CANUTE. My lord of Mercia, a good day! and thanks. You have perform'd fair service; for the which We shall be grateful. EDRIC. Sir, it moves me much That, with this manifest slight, you trespass on Our compact's true intent. You march to London? CANUTE. Such is our will. EDRIC. Whilst I, this kingdom's regent, Possess its keysâin arms? CANUTE. Even so. But come; We shall but waste our new-born love in jars, Which only make the vulgar speculate. We do not doubt we can expound some reasons Upon our way, shall satisfy your grace. [Exeunt. Court of the Palace in London. Enter Edric and Cornwall. CORNWALL. The Danes do lord it strangely here! I pray To be released from my most irksome charge Of joint command. The meanest citizen Cannot protect his house, his wife, his substance, From Turkill and these ruffian officers; Who laugh when, with remonstrance, I but name Your grace, or cite their king's commands. EDRIC. May all Scorch in eternal flames! Why com'st to me? As if I were the causeâand so from me The remedy might spring. Thou sting'st me, serpent! CORNWALL. This tone, my lord!âto meâ EDRIC. Nay, gentle Cornwall! Mine own most trusty (and most trusted) friend, Excuse these sallies. I am wrought upon, Thou know'st I am, too hardly for my temper. I would have restâa little solitudeâ And yetânoâstay, one moment. Presently I shall be calm. CORNWALL. It was well done to spare King Edmund's life. He may (if, as I think, The Danes shall play us foul) be useful yet. I worship thee for that good policy. EDRIC. What! wilt not give me credit for one deed Of lingering pity?âay, sir, fortify The arm and head by beggaring the heart. Onward, still onward, must I rush! CORNWALL. Too deeply You ponder on this matter. 'Tis not well To predicate great evils from slight cause: We shall but laugh hereafter at our fears. EDRIC. Your mind has not been task'd as mine has been. I have look'd down into the deep of time, And sounded with true plummet its abysses; And, hov'ring o'er its summer smoothness, well Can augur all its wintry wrath, and point Where shoals lie hid, rocks threaten, whirlpools menace; And trace past wrecks upon the horrid shores, Or 'neath the gloomy billows mouldering. Therefore it is that, with a boding eye, I watch the stormy symptoms of the times. CORNWALL. You know not yet Canute. EDRIC. Know him? Too well, And yet too little. It is hard to reach Unto the height of his proud mind; still harder Its range and dark recesses to explore. CORNWALL. True foxes' dens! strongholds of kindred craft! EDRIC. He is a man most crafty, though most brave: And, yet, being brave, not treach'rous, e'en to foes, Except so far as war's rough game allowsâ CORNWALL. To cheat ye with permitted stratagems. EDRIC. True: he will sluice men's blood in lawful quarrel As if 'twere water in a worthless pitcher. A mighty hunter, he will sweep on, on, Cheering his toothed hounds upon the prey, As if the chase of man were but a sport. And, yet, in peace he will be mild as maids are, And affable as any prosperous suitor; Though sworn to justice, leaning still to mercy; A keen inquisitor, yet most indulgent Where human hearts need kind interpreters. Withalâhe will not compass his desires By means that are not worthy of a king. CORNWALL. Ay, thus it isâ EDRIC. Thus?âyet I know him not; And no man knows him: and for this I hate him! So blended, and so opposite, his qualities: I cannot please, know not if I offend, Fear to oppose, and dare not tempt him. Come, comeâ I will endure these torturing doubts no longerâ This morning I will know my fate, and act As best becomes the crisis. Emma, too, Hath summon'd me to conference: too long Deferr'd:âI like not that. Lord Ethelmar, I will be satisfied! CORNWALL. You oughtâyou shall! [Exeunt. The Palace in London. Enter Canute and Emma. CANUTE. Fair queen, I will not now profess to thee That which would scarce become thy sober weeds, And would comport ill with my inward heart. I will not deal with thee as flatterers do With shallow girls, but speak as to a woman, Whose eye dwells less upon the flowers of life Than on its uses and realities. I do not offer you a youthful heart, (Though mine by age is such,) that, in its glee, Sports like the roebuck with the wind, but one Whose current has been chill'd by timeless frosts. If then thou may'st accept a soul, whose vigour Is but a bent bow in the public hand? If thou'lt wed beauty, delicate as thine, To a rough soldier's frame? lowly I proffer What a fastidious eye may pass unnoticed, But a wise heart will prize. EMMA. With joyful omen I take a pledge graced with sincerity; And with like plainness shall reply to you. I give you here a widow'd hand, but, with it, No widow'd heart; for mine hath never loved: In you, sir, I accept (and love from duty Gently will spring) a father for my children, And a protector of their mother's rights; Which thus, with perfect confidence, she yields Into your firmer grasp. CANUTE. As I acquit The trust, so prosper me kind Heaven! [They walk apart. Enter Edric. EDRIC (aside). How's this?â I dreamâI dream!â'Sdeath, why am I disturb'd At every idle chance? 'Tis natural Man should bow down upon the hand of beauty, And murmur well-conceiv'd adieus at parting. He whispersâsee! she smilesâbetraying devil! He puts his hot lip to her palmâfie, fie! CANUTE (on perceiving EDRIC). Mercia, Queen Emma hath deputed meâ EDRIC. Dane!âfrom her own lips I must learn her will. I thank theeâfor thyâkind interposition! [Attempting to pass. CANUTE. Hold back, my lord!âHow? you presumeâRetire! Curb this intemperance. EDRIC. Proud heart, be still! I should beâIâI am calm. Feel my hand. 'Tis cold, but trembles not. Nay, let me pass! In very humbleness I would beseech you. My heart is heavy with too many pangsâ Even certainty of wrong would bring relief. CANUTE. Sir, in pronouncing no, I mean you well: Attend to me: 'twere wise. EDRIC. My lord, I must pass. My brain is somewhat wildâobstruct me not. Queen Emma! hear! CANUTE. Not till you regulate Your mien with more discretion. EDRIC. Ha! ha!âwhat, The tyrant winces? CANUTE. Were I such, methinks A daring front might be abased. EDRIC. Damnation! Where, what am I, that hear and suffer this?â Art thou a fiend commission'd to torment me? Strike, with thy dagger! I could better bear it Than these cool taunts, and that sarcastic eye, Which sting me to my ruin. Speak! resolve meâ I can surmise, but would have certainty. Emma! I supplicateâI shall be brief,â And, my lord, temperate. CANUTE. To me your bearing Is of slight import. Is your grace disposed [To Emma. To the duke's prayer? Decision rests with you. EMMA. It is most painful; but I yield: you sanction, And I may not refuse. EDRIC (kneeling). My queen!âmy Emma! EMMA (to CANUTE, hastily). My lord, perhaps this scene would pain me less, Unwitness'dâyet be near me. Sir, I attend. [To Edric. EDRIC. With a torn heart, and sorrow-choking tongue, I kneel, I cling to thee, to ask my fate. Yet, ere you shape an answer to my fears, Pauseâand look back. Recall the love I bore you; Remember all the zeal wherewith I served you; Review the pledges that have pass'd between us, The vows I paid, the hopes wherewith you bless'd me, The smiles you lavish'd when I knelt and sued, And all I staked my life, my soul, upon, Which you, with blushing silence, ratified. Oh, can you think on these, and spurn me thus? What! silent?âwhatâmust all things be forgotten? And will you thus consign me to despair? Cruel, forsworn woman! EMMA. Not so, my lord: Here the deception has been yours, not mine. EDRIC. Mine the deception!âdo I hear aright? EMMA. Your own o'ervaulting passions, and blind treasons, Have been conspirators against yourself, And fill'd your mind with idle dreams. Begone! EDRIC. How's thisâam I awake? Art thou that Emma Who parley'd once with Mercia's daring suit? And I that Mercia, who, for Emma's love, Barter'd his peaceâhis faith? Oh false as beautiful! EMMA. Dare not to sully my fair fame with falsehoods, Monstrous, and hateful to me, asâthyself! Begone! thy suit is odious to my ears. When Emma listens, 'tis to worthier lips. EDRIC. This, in my rival's presence! this, to me! False one, thou stabb'st me with a double weapon. Yet hear me once. EMMA. No, Duke of Mercia, no! I have not sought this conference, which now Has grown too painful. What I had to speak His highness will declare. My lord, farewell! [Exit. EDRIC. Now am I reckless of the world! Speak onâ [To Canute. Speak to your errand, king! since such, indeed, Can lacquey for a woman. CANUTE. Duke of Mercia, I shall be briefâ EDRIC (interrupting). Oh ay; I comprehend. Brief! When a suitor has a point to win, With what a florid eloquence he swells His periods; how the liberal words flow forth! How full of promise then! but the suit gain'd, Heaven! what a change! And what a fool were he, Whose forward zeal had back'd him at his need, To urge, âMy succour here was prompt and timely, âMy advocacy there avail'd you much; âWhile still your fortune hung upon the beam, âMy hand was ready, and my counsel free; âAnd now I ask the promised recompense.â Reply, methinks, might be (as you now purpose) Brief.âSir, proceed. CANUTE (aside). I pray for patience, Heaven! The show, at least, of equanimity: Rebellious heart, be calm!â[Aloud].âThe queen, in memory Of your profess'd attachment, will not leave To common fame the story of her fate. As Mercia counsell'd once, she purposes To knit her feebler fortunes to a hand That may uphold them. EDRIC. Traitress!âName the man. CANUTE. Oh, not the Duke of Mercia. EDRIC. CanuteâI know thee Subtle; and have believed thee wise. CANUTE. I hear The text, and wait the exposition. EDRIC. I Trifle no more. King! I demand my right: Investiture of the Northumbrian lands I claim'd. CANUTE. And I pledged not. They are the guerdon Of a most stainless knightâAnlaffe of Jutland. EDRIC. Hear me! thou paltering fiend!âthou king!âthou Dane! (For, in that word, I would concentrate all That hatred can conceiveâscorn utter)âdream'st thou That Iâthat Iâwith power in my strong arm, And intellect that will not bend to thine; That I, from thee, will tamely, unavenged, Bear this light speech, these heavy, grinding wrongs? CANUTE. Why ay; such language well becomes such thoughts, And suits the hardy, cool, gigantic villain, Who, like some towering dÃ¦mon, stands before me. I can endure that sinister, dark eye, Shooting from 'neath the lowering brow askance Its levell'd ray: that fierce, malignant smile That curls the lip to an atrocious sneer, As thou regard'st me o'er thy shoulder. EDRIC. Dar'st thou? CANUTE. The mighty sea-snake so lifts up his neck Amid the storm; and scowls along the waters, Frighting the hearts of wave-worn mariners. But, serpent as thou art, thou know'st that I Am master of the elements, and rule thee, (Even as the wizard sways the fiends of hell) Weighing thy strength and weakness, fashioning To mine own ends thy passions and thy powers. âAway!â EDRIC. I go: but, first, hell hear me curse This Dane!âthis meddling, lying, cozening Dane! âAy,âthou shalt hear me, wert thou thrice as great, And I as helplessly within thy grasp.â May she, for whom thou thus art false, prove false To theeâas (mark me well) I know she has The aptitude: may she invade thy heart With cankering jealousyâand may her offspring Draw venom from her breast, and be to thee As vipers, stinging thee with doubtâuntil At length thy hope shall be they are not thine! CANUTE. I've borne this insolence too long. EDRIC. Ay, prince! Tap thy sword's hilt, as maidens try a lute: 'Twill fence thee in default of argument. CANUTE. Wretch! thus I stoop me to thy infamy. Draw, villain! EDRIC. Joyfullyâwith all my soul! [After a pause. I will not fight thee now. [He sheaths his sword. CANUTE. Defend thyself! EDRIC. Whatâhere?âhere, in thy very palace chamber? You 've a frank weapon, back'd thus with the odds. What, if thou fall'st?âthy officers, methinks, Might not be gentle judges of the fact. The glory of tyrannicides is goneâ Brutus is honour'd less than CÃ¦sar now. CANUTE. Begone! in safety: take twelve hours for flightâ Then, by the sacred household blood thou 'st shed! I will have vengeanceâdeep, inexorable. [Exit Canute. EDRIC. I goâbut shall return!â With what a look Of measured scorn he leaves me!âOut upon 't! I have borne this shame too far. Here do I kneel, Avenging Heaven! and supplicateânay, nay, I will not damn myself with prayers like these. âLet me be calmâoh, fool! the veriest slave, The common bully of the camp, may now Strut by thee with swoln lip and lifted brows, Blaming high heaven that moulded such a man. âMy brain is stunn'd: and yetâand yet, methinks, 'Twas wise to meet, as I have met, the blow. âDÃ¦mon of craft! was't not thy policy To goad me to perdition? But I am proof 'Gainst all. With half the kingdom in my grasp, Friends at my back, and space to combat on, Why should my spirit quail? Canute! the banner Of inextinguishable hate is raised Between usâwoe to him who first cries âQuarter!â [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART THE FOURTH. THE FUGITIVES. A Wood, apart from a Field of Battle. Enter, as from the combat, Edric and Cornwall. CORNWALL. Now must we flyâ EDRIC. Whither?âto heavenâor hell! It matters notâall 's over!âCornwall, farewell! It is the endâmy book of life is shut. CORNWALL. My lord, King Edmund yet makes head. EDRIC. If I Had join'd my ranks to his, we might have thriven. What then?âCare I who rules? Canute, to my ear, Knells with a sound not more disastrously Than Edmund. Why what fool am I to parley Thus with my fate! then let it come! a soldier's Should be most welcome on a battle-field. CORNWALL. Though reckless of your own fate, think of those Whose thread is knit with yours. EDRIC. What would you have? CORNWALL. We are enveloped by the double glooms Of night and heavy fortune, yet may hope T' elude the hunter's foot by speed or cunning. We know, by late report, King Edmund rests, Scarce fifty miles hence, in the mountain den Of the dead fox, Northumberland: perhaps, We, with some friends, may yet find refuge there. EDRIC (bitterly). Scant retinue, methinks! CORNWALL. Scant let it beâ We will not sum our strength by counting helms, Or measure hope with fear's arithmetic. The rock we found on is our tameless will. A singleness of aim shall animate One hardy sword to foil a troop of spears. The very unity of our despair Belts us in proof against an armament! How strict soe'er the toils, trust me, like boars We shall break through; and scatter all would bar us, As rotten brush-wood in a pathless wild.â Courage! EDRIC. Ha! think'st thou that I need thy clamour To nerve a craven heart? I tell thee, lord, Thus on the slippery edge of fate, I fear not Man in his craft or power, nor the wood idols To which he kneels, nor death. I vibrate only Between the fates that proffer; weighing slowly Which choice most shrewdly recommends itself. Be silent. I would think. Wellâto King Edmund March weâso be 't. Apprize such friends, as yet Th'insatiate jaws of battle have not crush'd, That we, ere twice the hopeful sun hath set, Stoop our repentant banner at the foot Of valiant Ironside. If once the beam Of fortune, 'twixt these rivals, shall be balanced, Once more the umpire weapon may command. [Exeunt. The open Country. Enter Bulloign, Frithegist, Morcar, and other Officers of King Edmund. BULLOIGN. Who, that remembers Ashdown, could have hoped To see an eve like this? Here stand we, sirs, Triumphant in the midst of our foe's wreck, Like a proud navy, when the storm is hush'd, Riding the surges 'mid their shatter'd prizes. MORCAR. The brave king will sleep well to-night. FRITHEGIST. Your pardon. To morrow being his bridal, he will have A mind too busy even for dreams. MORCAR. How like A tiger sprung he on Norwegian Harold, Smote him to earth, and slew him at a blow! FRITHEGIST. Now will he claim a kiss for every blow He gave or took in this same field to-day. 'Tis your true soldier's solace. MORCAR. Nay, for me A brimming mead-cup, not a pouting lip, Hath most refreshment after toils like ours. FRITHEGIST. He is a model for brave men. How nobly He shapes himself to ev'ry hap of fortune! With what a grace he wears a victory! But a lost battle makes him terrible. MORCAR. Ay; when he 'scaped at Ashdown, never stag Toss'd the bay'd dogs more gallantly in air. FRITHEGIST. Then with what skill his scatter'd troop he rallied; And, lavish of himself, stood faced to death, When the hot foe our fainting squadrons charged. And how devotedly our toils he shared! Upon the sentinel's rude couch he sleptâ (The mountain heather canopied with clouds)â Fed on the soldier's coarse and scanty fareâ While cheerful thoughts were ever on his tongue; Blithe jests of fellowship for common men, A martial descant for your stalwart captains; And, for sage chieftains, such a range of mind As seems to hold even victory in its grasp. BULLOIGN. Just, though enthusiastic, is your praise; And thus the roughest trooper's thought should be. But men are selfish, and the world ungrateful. Whyâthere are murmurers here, because, forsooth, The king 's a man and loves a woman: yet The hours he dedicates to her are all Stol'n from his needful rest, and none from duty. Enough of this. Now let us coolly scan Our fortunes: for Duke Edric's overthrow (Though his revolt was timely from Canute, And gave the foe divided to our onset, As this day's glorious vantage well has proved)â Edric's defeat, I say, will give the Dane Space to collect his shatter'd force, and speed Defiance to our teeth. MORCAR. Let him chafe on: He never shall escape; we now o'ermatch him. BULLOIGN. Doubtless we shall achieve what brave men can: But he is brave too; and, a wiser leader, With firmer soldiers, in a stronger post, Trust me, may not be found. True, he is lost If there defeated; and, without a battle, Retreat would be a desperate course: yet we Must combat in Canute a man whose conduct May not by common rules be circumscribed. MORCAR. All shall be well! BULLOIGN. Brethren in arms! our bearing Should make that hope assurance. Let us gaze, then, Upon chance danger with an open eyeâ And, circumspect as bold, act as befits Approved good soldiers, on whose conduct rests Their country's fate, when all is hazarded. [Exeunt. The Gate of Northumberland's Castle. Enter Edric, disguised. EDRIC. With more than mortal strength of heart and limb, Through fen and forest, since my late defeat, Have I escaped the bloodhounds of my foe. And now, ye towers of dead Northumberland! I come a friendless wanderer to your gates, To seek the hated footstool of a man Whom, beyond pardon, I have wrong'd, and therefore Hate not the less. What, should he greet meâthus? âSir, as a brother, you have rent all ties âOf brotherly allegiance from your heart, âAnd pluck'd the root-stone from your household wall; âSir, as a subject, you have stoop'd to the dust âThe glorious brow of an anointed king; âAnd made the sceptre as an osier twig, âThat scares a schoolboy.â Ay, these dread reproaches Should he not utter, still his heart must feel. Yet must I now, with penitence in eye, And crouching knees, and sorrow-bending neck, Submit me to this hero's clemency; Who knows that stern necessity, not love, Compels me to his mercy. I have, indeed, No other hope. Unconquerable Edmund! Well, with thine iron limbs, and heart of fire, Well hast thou stood a bulwark on the breach, From whence the shafts of war have glanced like hail, And Treason, foil'd of half his aim, retired. So end my plots, and here I stand at last, A wretch for every idiot lip to rail atâ A knave, o'ermatch'd and spurn'dâa woman's fool! Oh woman! what wert thou, that I should trust thee? And Iâthat woman should undo me thus? Enter Bulloign. BULLOIGN. Whom have we here? EDRIC. A man of penitence! BULLOIGN. What! Edric Streon?âin these beggar weeds!â Ay, this is retribution! EDRIC. Good my lord, Where may I seek the king?âmy weary knees Yearn to bend down in supplication. BULLOIGN. What would'st thou hope? EDRIC. From mercy muchâand much From a wise mind renouncing vengeance. Still May I redeem (it shall be shown) my fault. You pauseâlet me but see the king: I ask No more. BULLOIGN. Nay, God forbid that I should deem Pardon impossibleâor penitence An unavailing plea! It is a moment Most prosperous for a suitor. Yester eve Our royal warrior stoop'd his neck to fetters, Light as e'er Hymen laid on lover's limbs. EDRIC. Now Heaven be praised! BULLOIGN. He is in happy humour; And well may be.âFair Algitha! I saw her, All radiant from the nuptial couch, and cover'd With all her spousal blushes, as a veil; Modestly shrinking from admiring eyes: Even as the glowing harvest moon, when stealing Her earliest glances through the eastern grove, Winning all hearts with beauty. EDRIC. Well you speak Her praises, and have pictured forth a bride Such as beseems a youthful conqueror. BULLOIGN. I speak the truth. EDRIC. Oh! these are precious moments; Pray you excuse that, with most eager haste, I would improve them. BULLOIGN. Soft. Wait hereâ'twere well That I precede you. He is now within, And, with his gentle lady, culls the flowers, The fairest and the best this life can yield.â I shall but step into yon garden, where They range another paradise. Believe me, It would not be the office of a friend Here to intrude, unwelcome visitants Upon his cherish'd hour, too suddenly. [Exeunt. The Castle Garden. Edmund and Algitha. ALGITHA. Nay, now, dear love! I may not list to thee: My cheekâyou shall not see itâburns with blushes. Suffice it, that I love theeâoh, how well! And, with this hand, have giv'n the tend'rest proof. EDMUND. Speak!âlet me hear that voice of melody! In its sweet music, like the summer air, Chiding, with almost inarticulate breath, The saucy flowers, that will not cease to load Her wings with incense, till, o'ercome and faint, She flutters o'er the perfumed flattery, And dies amid a wilderness of sweets. Speak on. ALGITHA. I will not: yet methinks, I will; To prove to thee how inharmoniously The voice of love may jar on love. Was 't not Upon the dreaming breast of Silence first, The cherub Love was hush'd in infancy? EDMUND. I must be silent now: I can but gaze, Till my sight dims with rapture. ALGITHA. Tell me not In words that I am loved; call me not fair; Oh sully not the mirror, purity, With Flattery's warm breath. Believe it, love, The lips are ever false interpreters, And feebly speak the language of the heart. But, would'st thou descant on the sweetest theme That e'er shed roses on the cheek of youth, Then be thine eloquence not of the tongue, But couch thine argument within the eye: There let the spirit of love stand radiantâ A seraph steep'd in light. EDMUND. Oh, how I love thee! ALGITHA. Nay, now that you look thus, it doth repent me That I so lightly talk'd of this eye-language. Oh, then I must fly from theeâ EDMUND. Thus I detain theeâ And thusâ(nay, on thy hand then) fix love's seal, That shall avail to fetter thee. My beautiful, My delicate, pure-thoughted Algitha! Within this paradise of flowers thou dwellest As one whose spirit owns a kindred being With all those subtle perfumes that exhale From Nature's loneliest treasury of sweets. ALGITHA. Nay, this is flatteryâall flattery. EDMUND. Say, then, How shall I woo thee?âhow acquit my love? Give me that hand, so soft, so small, so fair, So rounded in its tinted palm, so taper'd In every rose-tipp'd finger. Let me kiss The azure tracery, thus interlaced Upon its ivory surface. Now you smile. ALGITHA. In quiet joy. What would you with my hand? EDMUND. Thou delicate, fair palm! Let me peruse thy mystic characters. Why, what a maze is here of vagrant lines, Sketch'd lightly o'er the silken skin, as on A fossil rock the impress of a leaf. Behold the mystic characters! My love! I 'm grown a very seer in palmistry, And read a smiling fortune in this hand. Does not my skill claim some reward?âa kiss?â ALGITHA. Fond fool, begone! EDMUND. Well, I am goneâ ALGITHA. No, stay. EDMUND. Oh, then, I must be bribed. ALGITHA. Thou venal wretch! What would'st thou have? EDMUND. A kissâa smileâa sighâ A pressure of the handâa look of love. Nay, there is not an accent of that tongue, A motion of those lips, a transient glance Of those soft eyes, but win upon my heart With some new witchery. 'Tis very strange, But, when I see thee, hear thee, think upon thee. Stern manhood softens to a woman's mood, And I become the very slave of tears. ALGITHA. The tears of joy are sweeter than her smiles. EDMUND. Bountiful Heaven! with benignant hand, How thou dost temper all our woes with mercyâ Till the good triumph o'er our evil days! My Algitha, in mystery I found thee, In levity pursued, in madness loved thee! 'Mid thronging perils with true service woo'd thee, And, in the height of all my wrongs and sorrows, When all but life seem'd lost, by pity won thee. ALGITHA. A happy captive, cherishing her chains. EDMUND. And now, in these wild times, thou look'st upon me As a warm sunbeam, breaking through the clouds, In freshen'd glory lighting up a landscape, Seen by tired traveller from some shelter'd seat. Oh, sweet is hope in youth's untroubled dawn, And pleasant memory to the night of age! But when a truant joy beams through the gloom Of days like ours, it is philosophy To snatch the noontide hours of happiness, And crowd an age into one precious span. ALGITHA. Nay, my philosophy is better worth. The present has to me a keener zest In its connexion with the past and future. Since I 've known thee, my dearest bliss is hope. Trust me, the summer of our life shall wear A less tempestuous aspect than its spring; And, in our autumn, such sweet thoughts shall cheer us, As shall make smooth our wintry path to Heaven. Life may have now a keener relish; but, As years creep on, the heart grows tenderer, And tranquil thoughts steal gradually round us, As the young ivy to the age-gnarl'd trunk More firmly clings, than to the smoothest sapling. Thus men seem knit to home, in middle age, By fonder ties than in their prime of days; And thus it is that, in the eve of life, The grandsire is the playmate of the child. Enter a groupe of Masquers, Dancers, Musicians, &amp;c. with a Poet. They pass in procession. EDMUND. How now!âwhat mean these mummers? POET. We come, my lord, to greet your grace and bride With quaint shows and devices. EDMUND. What are you, sir? Lord of Misrule, I take it; and these masquers The subjects of so grave a potentate. POET. I am, may 't please your grace, a poet; and You see, herewith, the poor machinery By which I eke out my conceits, as 't were A palpable imagery. May I proceed T' unfold to this fair lady our device? EDMUND. What says my Algitha? ALGITHA. Most willingly. The show will be a brave one. POET. I would explain. These dancers, in their figured maze, will shadow (Unworthy though they be) some mysteries. EDMUND. Nay, sir, we shall be well content to admire The text uncommented. POET. Minstrels, strike up! And touch your instruments with skill divinest. When, having solaced with harmonious sound The royal ear, incontinent will I Recite some well-concerted compliments, Learn'd descants, and poetic rhapsodies, Which, I presume to hope, somewhat may please. A Masque, emblematical of Bridal Ceremonies, with Music and Dancing, &amp;c.; in the course of which is introduced the following HYMENEAL SONG. Awake! awake! the hour approaches When, with silent, sweet reproaches, At each light delay, thy bride With coy, downcast looks shall chide; And refuse thy trembling kiss Its custom'd, momentary, bliss. Wake! in kindling heaven afar Softly winks the matin star, Phosphor, from the shades of night Stepping o'er his path of light, Ere his sire, the Sun, hath bounded From fond Thetis' couch; surrounded With triumphant Tritons, blowing Wreathed conchs; and Nereids showing White and graceful forms, reposing On the clear waves, and disclosing, By their mien, and sidelong eyes, Sympathy with human ties. Rise! the younger Hours have sprung Through the bright gates, open flung, On th' horizon's glowing rim; And the fresh Sol gathers him, With a gladiator's spring, To o'erleap this earthly ring. Rise! thy young bride now is waking From her dream of thee, and breaking, With commingling smiles and tears, From a trance of hopes and fears; For her thoughts were full of thee; And her thoughts were ecstacy. Now, her modest couch beside, Cowering she sits, in blushing pride; And lets down her flowing tresses O'er a bosom that confesses, In its rapid fall and swell, That she loves theeâoh, how well! Now her smiling handmaids bring Every snowy-tinted thing That for bridal trim seems meet: Silken slippers for soft feet; Modest kerchief for a breast Where a rude eye dares not rest; Broider'd robe, that clings to her O'er a slender stomacher; With a light, transparent veil That for shame shall scarce avail, Knit by wreaths to her bow'd headâ Roses and wheat-ears garlanded. Up! and haste thee to her arms, Trembling with no feign'd alarms! Now, the bright Divinity, Stooping to the western sea, With a lover's blushful haste, Who the sweet hours may not waste, Ere he plunges in the tide, Casts one smiling glance aside To his sister moon, that high From the lucid, azure sky, With half-averted features, pale, (Like a face behind a veil) Looks to earth; while star by star Light their diamond sparks afar: And the cheek of evening flushes, In its last empurpling blushes, With a tint, suffusing all, Like a sleeping Bacchanal. Haste! the nuptial rites prepare! Now the jovial midnight air Speed with music round the couch Where the laughing bride-maids crouch, As they lay a tearful head On the dedicated bed; And, with decent care, exclude The faint taper's glances rude, That might tell her coming boy All her fears and all her joy. Now the nuptial rites are over, And each home-returning lover, With his fair beside him, mute, Whispers his propitious suit, And resolves, with brief delay, To be happy while they may! EDMUND. Poet, thou hast acquitted thee full well, And shalt receive the poet's laurel meed, Placed on thy brow by hands most beautiful. Thou shalt have gold too: get thee goneâno thanks. [Exit Poet, &amp;c. Enter Bulloign. Ha! Eustace! Thou art welcomeâeven here. BULLOIGN. I come, sir, on the part o' the sinfullest man (Haply most penitent) that ever craved The boon of mercy from offended majestyâ Edric of Mercia. EDMUND. Why would'st thou speak a name So odious to my soul: and hereâand now? BULLOIGN. My liege, it is the bane of sovereignty That leisure is a word whose gentle sound May not survive within its stormy sphere. EDMUND. Truly thou speak'st. A king's ear should be open To the faint sighing of his meanest subject As to the courtly influence of the great. Nor let us harshly judge an irksome task: For duty done contains its own reward; As the red iron sears and heals together. Speak thenâof Edric Streon. BULLOIGN. He is a man Most hateful to my heart; yet now so lost In fortune, so abased in spirit, wretched, Not simply in his sense of guilt, but guilt O'ermatch'd and beggar'd by its own inventions, That I could almost trust his abject griefâ EDMUND. To be again betray'd! ALGITHA. Nay, love, to me It seems that in the human heart there dwells A spirit of conscience, that from second guilt Avails to shield repentant vice. EDMUND. Such should beâ And policy might come in aid of virtue, To teach how well prosperity on earth May be combined with Heaven. Grieved I look On a lost creature, finely gifted, such As this most wretched man; who once appear'd Of better clay than common mortal men. I loved himâI have trusted himâand he Hath paid me with ingratitude, hate, treason. These could I pardon; butâ ALGITHA. Dearest, remember, He now is but the crime-gall'd, helpless slaveâ Cast on thy mercy, voluntarily castâ Without one hope but pity: and, save penitence, (That may indeed subdue) all weaponless. EDMUND. He 's arm'd with an inexorable heartâ In which no spring of human kindness waits The holy stroke, even of a Moses' wand. I trusted all to him! ALGITHA. I do adjure thee, Spare his repentanceâspare him in his crimesâ Leave him to conscience, and forgiving Heaven! EDMUND. Angel of pity! thou hast pleaded wellâ I trust for allâhe lives. ALGITHA. Ah, this is glory! Thus round a hero's neck I wind my arms With a far nobler joy than as a bride. EDMUND. My love! my life! God be my witness! not For private, but for public wrong, I pause. Were I but man, and not a prince (alas! For royalty, that these are not as one!) I could fling out my arms and take him back Even with a dagger in his belt: but now I must assert my kingdom's weal. He lives! But, as a stranger to his household hearth. I will not even banish him this soil, (For that were worse than death indeed) but he Must dwell as aliens do in foreign lands. BULLOIGN. He charged me urge how he may yet redeem His guilt by precious service. EDMUND. I despise, And would reject, his aid; though it could seat me Upon a CÃ¦sar's throne. Come, Algitha, We will discourse, as we proceed, how best The tenor of our will may be enforced. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART THE FIFTH. THE SINGLE COMBAT. A Grove, in Front of Edmund's Camp. Enter Edric in agitation, Cornwall following him. CORNWALL. My lord! Why walk you thus aside, so moodily? My lord!âLord Edric!âbe not thus disturb'd. EDRIC. If thou wert as a captive at the bar, Watching his judge's lip, that shall pronounce The instant doom, and that a doubtful one: If thou wert as a felon at the tree, Who, in the dead pause of the silent crowd, Has yet some hope to hear a voice cryââPardon:â If thou wert as the drowning, dying wretch, Who, at his last gasp, sees a coming aidâ How would'st thou feelâhow act?

I have the king's commands, in few brief words, To say to Edric Streon,âthat his crime, As it affects the person of the king, Has been forgiven; but that, inasmuch As, in its consequence, it hath committed The kingdom's weal, it may not be forgotten. You may assure yourself of lifeânay, more, Freedom from forced restraint.âBut you must live Even as a stranger to your house, and dwell An alien in your native land.âYou speak not. CORNWALL. Sir, pray you notice not this mood: despair Preys on his very heart. [Bulloign bows assent, and retires. CORNWALL. Will you not speak? EDRIC (after a pause). The deep-sea wave has pass'd o'er me:âI breathe Again! CORNWALL. My lord, what think you on? What would you? EDRIC. Vengeance! CORNWALL. Does vengeance need long pondering? EDRIC. There falters at my heart a something still I struggle with, I wrestle with in vain. Nayâthus I rend ye forth, and scatter ye Unto the elements! Away!âfarewell! Thou gentler spirit, that still lingering clung, As a good angel, to my heart!âfarewell! All sad, remorseful thoughts! instinct of conscience, And sacred love of human-kindâfarewell! But welcome, ye black ministers of evil, With all your tossing torches! and, throughout The pitchy darkness of my soul, fling all Your fellest flames! CORNWALL. Be prudentâwe are observed. Enter a group of Officers: Edric regards them fiercely. EDRIC. Why let them comeâthey never shall behold A man more wretched, and so desperate! CORNWALL. Retire, I pray, a moment. There seems, here, Something a watchful spirit may improve. [Edric and Cornwall walk apart. FIRST OFFICER. In truth I 'm sick of this: these mountain marches, In quest of what still, as the fire o' the fen, Eludes our grasp, wear out my patience. SECOND OFFICER. Wherefore Should the king still refuse the proffer'd truce? Canute, methinks, from yon entrenchment looks Like one who needs small aid from aught but weapon. THIRD OFFICER. Tush! the king judges (rightly, I think) that these Circumvallating lines, and tangled passes, But breed distrust of their own prowess in The adverse ranks; who thus more feebly shall Resist our onset; and more surely perish, Caught in this labyrinth of rocks and woods, Rivers and fens. FIRST OFFICER. And what care we?âWill England Be happier for our deaths?âfor sooner, trust me, Than the Dane be dislodged, we perish. Pah! It sours my blood, pondering on these our toils, Dangers, and abstinence, to think that he, Who, like the war-horse, should brave all, but trifles. The precious moments, like a lusty palfrey Ambling beneath a woman's silken rein. I 'll fight no more. EDRIC (who has approached during this speech). And wherefore have ye fought?â For honourâfame? Oh, these, indeed, are titles That proud war doth affect; but, do they last? A glorious harvest?âtrue: but who the reaper? Your common men may toil, and bleed, and die, Bondsmen of fameâartificers of honour, Planting the bay they wear not; garlanding A master's brow. What is the mark ye aim at? He that affects a diadem, should brave The hazard of his daring; nor depute His vengeance to an hireling; nor transfer To borrow'd hands the peril of the deed: Th' ambition is his ownâand such should be The triumph, or the penance. This is my counsel, (Simple, direct, and honest, as befits Plain-spoken soldiers)âI would have these kings, With their own swords, close their peculiar quarrel, And fight for mastership: so shall we save Much innocent blood, and many doubtful days: Or, let them take this kingdom, this poor soil, This home of sorrow, this degraded England, And e'en divide it. It has own'd seven masters, And may suffice for two. THIRD OFFICER. By Heaven! my lord, It is a thought the king, most joyfully, Will give his heart to. FIRST OFFICER. Ay, it takes my fancy. SECOND OFFICER. And mine. FIRST OFFICER. Then haste we to the camp, and urge The general voice to back our suit. THIRD OFFICER. The king Hath sought this course before, and now will leap T' anticipate our prayer. Brave comrades, forward! [Exeunt. EDRIC. Edmund!âmy star looks brightly from its cloud, While thine is on the wane. Soon shall thy fate, Now soaring as an eagle, stoop to earth, Like a kite struggling in a serpent's folds. There may be darker spirits in their camp Than these: 'twere well we probed this malady. Cornwallâsteal thou unto their camp to-night, And touch the plague spot with a fearless hand. Goâin thy wiliest caution mantled: dive Deep in the soldiers' heartsâand learnâand promptâ Nay, this must be well weigh'd. My Cornwallâcome, Blest with a friend like thee, can I despair? [Exeunt. The Danish Camp. Enter Canute, Turkill, Gothmund, and Officers. CANUTE. Roll'd in her shadows, the wan spirit of night Descends: so frowningly our fortunes lour; And angry nature heralds in a day Of danger, it may be of doom, to us. GOTHMUND. The road is open to retreat. CANUTE. Not so. From a fair field the brave have no retreat. I have consider'd deeply, and here plant My standardâon this rock. Enter Bulloign, introduced. CANUTE. The Earl of Bulloign? Welcome, brave soldier! BULLOIGN. Royal sir, my errand Is of such nature as a princely heart, Swoln with the blood of warlike ancestry, Will glory to make good. Our valiant Edmund, Who in this tug of war hath well approved His noble lineage, and may proudly deem Canute his glorious peer, hath long in tears Of blood deplored this desolating strife; And, even in death, would gladly seal a peace By his best blood cemented: therefore it is, (And with no sanguinary, vengeful thought, Or vain disparagement of Canute's prowess) He hath commanded meâwaving all vantage The chance of this unequal field allowsâ To dare his rival to the mortal lists: There, hand to hand, as well becomes brave men, To terminate this quarrel. In such spirit, Here I fling down his stainless knightly gage. CANUTE. My lord! my heart leaps to requite your challenge As its brave bearing well deserves. What say ye, My Danish men? Shall we not fitly thus Purchase triumphant peace? Nay, nay, good Turkill, Obstruct me notâthe tide of common blood, Could that suffice, too freely has been pour'd. âEustace of Bulloign, take this glove of mine Back to the King of England: pledge that to-morrow The Danish or the Saxon sun shall set. On our part we appoint Earls Turkill, Gothmund, And Anlaffe, marshals of the lists. BULLOIGN. On ours, We shall depute Lords Frithegist and Morcar, And (though scarce worthy of such fellowship) Myself, poor Eustace Bulloign, brother of England. CANUTE. Bulloign, your hand! I know none worthier. Farewell! [Exit Bulloign. The time, my lords, 'twixt heaven and me May be but brief; which, for our kingdom's welfare, And our soul's comfort, must be husbanded. [Exeunt Turkill, Gothmund, &amp;c. CANUTE. (after pacing apart for some time, with hurried step). I thank ye, spirits of my ancestors! Now look ye down on my aspiring soul, And make me dreadful as the icy winds That slay whate'er they breathe upon! Just vengeance! Rush to my heart! make all my muscles steelâ Keen as my wrongs, as pliant as my will! Spirit of Odin! to my life-blood leapâ And with thine ancient terrors light mine eyes, That with my port I may appal all hearts!â Thou gory mace! thou trenchant sword! twin ministers Of fate and glory, to my heart I catch yeâ Fonder than ever father clasp'd his first-born! âHa! at the touch, the hot blood through my veins Rushes like molten metalâVengeance, thou 'rt mine! Glory, thou art my mate! empire, my guerdon! âLash your o'erwearied team, thou sluggish day, And light me to the goal!âI tread on air! [Exit into his tent. The Door of Edmund's Tent. Midnight. EDMUND (alone). From the dear arms of love I break one moment, To commune with sad thoughts. Oh king!âoh slave! What is the power that thus the popular voice Can, at a breath, dispel? The general foe Was in our grasp; and now, on one weak arm The fate of millions must depend: so will The many, in their blindness. Whence this weight Upon my spirit? That the foe thus dares me, Should be a triumph; which my heart hath long Sigh'd for in vain: yet now it comes, at last, More like an evil. Some men say, that Fate, As from a palpable form, casts a true shadow Down on the victim she pursues: if so, Even now I need the prayers of holy men. âHow strange, how very strange it is to think On all the changes of this mortal being, Standing thus 'neath th' eternal cope of heaven! Yon zone of stars, whose congregated rays Distinctly mark an angel pathway through A wilderness of glory! this fair earth, With its enduring featuresâhigh brow'd mountains, Bright-beaming lakes that glance 'neath shaggy cliffs, Rivers that through the bloomy meadows wander, With their blue-branching veins; and all those sounds Of breathing and pervading life:âthese, these, Have an imperishable frame, whose youth Is bosom'd on eternity:âbut we, Poor fragile atoms! dust upon the whirlwind! We are at best but parasitic things: Moss on the cliff, green ivy on the tower, The barren misletoe upon the oak, The limpet on the tide-wash'd rock, or, meaner, The insect on the lion's throat, that stings Yet lives!â Forgive me, Heaven! in petulance I spoke, forgetful. Oh! my wife!âmy wife! How full of bitterness 'tis now to dwell On what we have beenâwhat thou may'st be, scarce Dare I to think. Life was to me, till lately, A thing I set light thought upon, save only As yielding paths to fame; but thou hast pointed Such beauties in its maze, that now I prize it For thee, perhaps beyond its worth. I tremble, As a tried warrior should not, when I reflect How a chance blow may leave thee desolate. âI must avert my mind from this; nor feign Pictures to freeze my heart's blood, when th' occasion Needs ev'ry pulse.â Enter Bulloign. BULLOIGN. The midnight chimes have pass'd, And the thick-beating tread of preparation Will soon awake our camp. Your grace already Anticipates the time. EDMUND. My armour? BULLOIGN. Bravely Is burnish'd, and the rivets well assured. EDMUND. By my best hopes! it shames me to have dwelt On such a thought. Methinks an active frame, A nimble eye, and a well-practised hand, Nerved by a fearless heart, are better aids Than on the cumber'd limbs harness of proof. BULLOIGN. Why leave you still that sullen malcontent, Edric, to sow sedition through our camp? EDMUND. I heed him notâit matters notâthis day Shall leave his crook'd fangs venomless: forget him. BULLOIGN. My mind misgives meâ EDMUND. As does mine: but not For him, or any mortal thing. Dear Eustace, I have had secret converse with my heart, And find that, in its giddy youth, 't has been Wanting to its Creator. I have thought On every thing but Heaven! BULLOIGN. Now saints forfend! You wrong yourself, my lord: I know you better. EDMUND. I cannot think the man hath ever lived, Who in his secret heart abjures his God. Believe it not:âthere may be fops and fools Who aim at singularity of thought, (Or to whom nature hath denied all thought); But, that a sentinent and reflecting being Can look round and deny, I'll not believe it. Oh no! oh no!âObserve this flowerâits texture, Its tints, its odour: on yon southern hill Harvests more precious than the gold they rival: There the fair fruitage on the leafy tree, Shading the juicy carpet of the grass: And, amid all, the bee that booms along Rejoicing o'er his fragrant task: the small birds Chirping their nuptial songs beside the nest: The wild doe, with her fawn, through dim glades bounding: Th' unshackled colt, on the hill-side careering: Sleek heifers, 'mid the tufted herbs reposing; And man, intelligent man, with lordly port, Stepping, a monarch, o'er his subject realms. How perfect all in beauty and in use! Link'd in a chain of mutual dependenceâ How various, yet combined in harmony! How curious each in separate construction! Yet, in their application, obviousâoh! How utterly inimitable!âTrust me, There cannot live the man, who, seeing these, Bows not in humblest adoration to The good, the great, the wise, the present God! BULLOIGN. Mine own dear prince! it fills my heart with joy To hear these wholesome words: in these we conquer! EDMUND. Ah! words are vainâvain, empty air! our deeds Shall at the last avail us. Good, my brother, The time is short, which I would dedicate, Partly, (with heart abased) unto my God; And part devoted to those blessed ties Which he has consecrated. Brother, adieu! [They separate. Edmund retires apart. Enter Algitha, from the tent. ALGITHA. My love!âHe 's gone. Alas, my fainting soul! A host of phantoms terrify my brain. Vainly I chide my self-betraying heart, And whisper that 't has ever been the lot Of human greatness to endure this penance. Oh royalty! thy robe is hemm'd with jewels, But penitential sackcloth wounds thy skin. âVain are these thoughts: I 'm but a woman stillâ Whose present joy, whose future hope, is love; Whose treasury of hoarded thoughts is love; Whose task, whose duty, whose reward, is love. âOh! mine own husband, can I bear to watch This coming day, when, to thy country's altar, A victim with thy glories garlanded, Thou com'st?âand Iâeven I, poor weeping fool, Conspire thy ruin: have I not deprived Thine eyes of rest, with my vain sorrow; sobbing My weary soul to sleep upon thy bosom, That still was wakeful in its cares for me? âBut see, where yonder on his knees, bow'd down, Beneath the starry vault of Heaven, he prays. His manly front uncover'd, and upraised In meek devotionâhis persuasive lips Disparted in their breathing pietyâ His bright, commanding eye soften'd with feelings That link him with God's holy ones;âhis hands Folded in patient prayer on his bare breast. Thou sacred warrior! I feel an awful hope spring in my bosom, Caught from the radiance of thy tranced eye: A deep, religious joy thrills my swoln heart, As I behold thy manifest converse with Beings of holier worlds!âThus gazing on thee, I feel that I could look even on thy death Less in despair than hope. I will retire, And gather all things that he loves, to greet His homeward eye, and gently minister, Like a fond, faithful slave, to all his wants. âBless thee, my husband! [Exit. The Lists. Crowds of English and Danes, Soldiers and Peasants. EDRIC (coming forward). Curse on ye all!âHeaven's wrath descend upon ye! Vile, fickle, heartless minions! There ye crowd, And strain, and elbow, and, with dissonant cries, âCanute!â now âEdmund!â shout upon the wind, As each gay pageant, in its bravery, Supplants its rival. Ay, ye brainless clowns! Gaze on the show, (albeit, an hour shall dim Its sheen in gore, dapple its plumes with dust) As if it were some holiday tournament, Where, with fond favours stuck upon their crests, Fair, beardless gallants tilt at female hearts. That shout again!âmy heart is sickâmy brain Reels with this senseless clamour. Enter Cornwall. What from the camp? The troopsâthe officersâmy native Mercians?â Does discontent make head?âallegiance falter? May an old chieftain's voice still challenge sway? Can memory of ancient favours still Urge on the bold, or paralyze the weak? What say ambition, jealousy, hate, fearâ The fickle, the voluptuous, the feeble? Speak!âthrough my heart and brain a thousand passions Tumultuous rush. CORNWALL. Silence would better suit What I have learn'd, and language cannot soften. EDRIC. Dare not to trifleâspeak! CORNWALL. What shall I say? 'Twere better not to speak, than (pardon me) To speak, at such a time, unwelcome truths; But, thus it is. There is not, in yon camp, 'Mid all their growing discontents, one false In his allegiance to the king: and many (I grieve to say 't) were lavish of dispraise, When, though with cautious surmise, I but named Your grace's claims and merits: which they noted With irony, or most unmanner'd censure. EDRIC. Traitor! thou durst not swear it!âby this light, Which, like a sulphurous fog, deadens my eyes, And chokes my breath, thou durst not!âHa? CORNWALL. Unhand me! It is too much, my lord:âam I to blame, That fate so ill accords to your desires, Or that your reputation mars your fortunes? EDRIC. Ha! ha!âthou dÃ¦mon!âIâIâcannot breathe! CORNWALL. Why, what is this?âawake! and be a man!â Know you no shorter way than plots?âwould blood Stagger you now? EDRIC. Know me, Lord Ethelmar. I am a man that was not born to blood, Though circumstance hath train'd my hand to blood. I have been wrought upon by dÃ¦mons, dragg'd, Spite of my better nature, to a stake Where I must combat to the death, with hell Gaping beneath my foot!â(and hell ne'er bought A soul more surely lost). Yet, have I dared More than earth's treasuresâpower, good fame, delights, (Even had I won, as I have lost, all these) Could compensate; and, having stepp'd so far, I will not now abate my will one inch; Though it should lead me on o'er leagues of carnage, Float me in blood, steep me in blackest guilt, And plunge me in perdition's deepest gulf. [A distant salute of trumpets, shouts, and military music. Hark! heard you not the brazen voice of death Peal his wild summons to the feast of blood?â Cornwall! the hour is come! The Procession to the Lists. HERALD. Ho! stand aside. EDRIC (menacing). Slave! dost not know me? CORNWALL. Stand aside, my lord, And, like the crouch'd wolf, watch your time. HERALDS. Keep silence! [A salute of Trumpets: then, ENGLISH HERALD. Know all men! that Lord Edmund, King of England, Defies unto these lists the King of Danes; And, with his good sword, on this field, will prove him A false usurper!âso Heaven guard the right! [A salute of Trumpets. DANISH HERALD. Canute, the king, defies to mortal quarrel Edmund of England; and, within these lists, Will, in his recreant blood, make good his cause! So Heaven advance the bold! [The English and Danish troops, with appropriate banners, respectively pass: then grooms, with led horses; who range themselves at each side. Enter, from different quarters, Edmund, and Canute, completely armed. The former attended by Bulloign, Frithegist, and Morcar; the latter by Turkill, Gothmund, and Anlaffe, as joint Marshals of the Lists. SOLDIERY ON EACH SIDE. âGod save King Edmund!â âCanute! Canute!â [Canute steps forward. HERALD. Silence!âthe king would speak. CANUTE. To you, lords, who surround me, ere the trumpet Summons to horse, I would in brief address me; Trusting to right my motives in some hearts Which now mistrust me. That for England's crown I stand a bold competitor in arms, The will of half the noblest of your realm Shall be my plea: that I was wrought to this By the sore wrongs wherewith King Ethelred Assail'd my nation and my house; by all The violated treaties, perjured oaths, Whereby our earlier vengeance had been stay'd; I do confess: that I have sundry claims, Touching the justice of this enterprise, All men know wellâmost will admit: and, further, That, as a victor in so many fields, I may not yield what faithful hearts have bled for, To all brave men I make appeal!âThou, Edmund, (Whose virtues, and true royalty of soul, Freely I own, and, owning, hope to win Much honourable fame in this day's strife), Be thou my witness, that I meet thee here With no malignant passions in my heart, But with the aspirations of a soldier, Who with a worthy compeer stands confronted, And knows that one, or both, ere set of sun, Must die. EDMUND. Canute, if thou surviv'st this field, (Though otherwise I hope) I counsel thee To put thy trust in action more than words. With my sword's point I press my arguments. What ho! my horse!âwe waste the precious time! Born to this kingdom, I will die a king! [English Soldiery shout. Long live King Edmund! EDRIC (from the side). I say, long liveâCanute! [Saxon Soldiers menace, and Danish protect, Edric. EDMUND (interposing). Hold back! disperse!âCanute, call off your ban-dogs That threat me thus.âBrave English gentlemen, Unhand that madman: by my heart, he is not Worthy a brave man's vengeance! Traitor, begone! Thou sav'dst my life once; take thine own: th' account Is balanced:âlook that you forget it not. [Both Kings, at the trumpet-signal, mount their chargers, and, attended by their respective suites, proceed towards the inner part of the lists, passing under a triumphal archway. CORNWALL. What tempted you, my lord, to that wild sally? EDRIC. It matters not. Look, and report what passes. CORNWALL. You spared his lifeâ EDRIC. Look to the lists. CORNWALL. He now Spares yoursâ EDRIC (impatiently). The lists, I say! CORNWALL. Yet taunts you gravely. EDRIC. I 'm dangerous!âtempt me not. CORNWALL. He bids you note That the account is balanced. EDRIC. I shall remember! No more: look forth, and sayâwhat of the lists? CORNWALL. This is a scene, my lord, that all men crowd to With hungry eyes, that may not be appeased: Why shrinks your eye, alone, from marking it? EDRIC. Search not my heart: it is inscrutable Even to myself. CORNWALL. It seems to me, thus gazing Upon your hollow eyes and sallow cheeks, Sparkling and spotted with contending passionsâ EDRIC. What am I fallen to?âBe silent! Darest thou Thus to dissect my mind, and measure me, As if I were some idle prodigy, For fools' lips to descant on? Say that I hate This man, and will not look on his chance triumphâ Say that 'tis envy; and these plaudits writhe me Like serpent hisses, ere the sting be feltâ Say that 'tis weakness, madness, pitiful follyâ Sayâwhat you willâI care not! CORNWALL (suddenly). Lo! they burst The barrierâand the rushing waves of armour Flash onwardâa bright cataract of heroes! There springs the Kingâby Heaven! th' Archangel Michael Look'd not more terrible to Satan! See himâ As borne upon some courser of the elements, Whose light ethereal limbs sport on the air, Making the winds they paw their well-known paths On which to spring! With what a graceful ease The royal Edmund sits! his snowy plumes Surging, like crested billows, to each bound Of the wild charger; and his jewell'd mail, As, with true knightly skill, his supple form Sways to the motion, glancing in the sun Like rippling waters, or the morning dew-drops Upon a mountain-thorn! Hark! those glad shouts With which the royal presence is saluted! What flight of bonnets leaping on the air! What press of banners sweeping the green grass! What throng of streaming scarfs waved by fair hands! And now, with graceful courtesy, he doffs His plumy casque, and loosens o'er his shoulders A flood of golden curlsâglorious, by Heaven! EDRIC. 'Sdeath, what a coil of bootless sound is here! CORNWALL. And see! with scornful toss, he flings away His helm, disdainful of its aid; first rending Its regal circlet, which on his fair brow He plants, and looks round on the throng, as one Who, or in life or death, will be a king! EDRIC. Hast thou no eye for Canute? CORNWALL. I regard him Firm in his seat, like a collected soldier, Stepping his sinewy, well-managed steed Along th' elastic turf; whose gather'd haunches, Arch'd, bridling neck, and keen protruded ears, Mark his impatient vigour for the charge. Canute right nobly, as a tried knight, bears him. So steadily, with such an upright port, (Resting his glaived hand on his ample thigh, And his brows shadow'd by his raven crest), He spans his well-mail'd charger, it were surely No figure of the fancy to name both, Like the famed Centaur, but one animal. [The trumpets sound. EDRIC. The trump! the trump! CORNWALL. They spring upon each other! EDRIC (with a rush forward). Who falls?âBy heaven! by hell! the Dane is down. CORNWALL. Dismiss your fearsâKing Edmund flings away His fortunes with his lance. He leaps to earth! And, with drawn sword, assaults the wary Dane. Ha! he gives wayâretreating, step by stepâ EDRIC. Death! who gives way? CORNWALL. Canute. He aims no blow; But parries the hot onset with fix'd eye. Hark! you may hear their clashing swords; they now Approach so near. [A tumultuous crowd rushes in, shouting âAn Edmund!âââA Canute!â [Through the crowd an open space is formed. Canute, faint and exhausted, enters fighting with Edmund, who presses him vigorously. EDMUND. Dost thou renounce thy claim? Crav'st thou for life? CANUTE. Strik on! EDMUND. May Heaven accept thy valiant soul, Which thus I speed! [He strikes Canute down, shattering his sword. Wilt yield? Canute, submit, And I will spare thy life. CANUTE. Strike, once again! Strike at my throat! EDMUND (turning from him). No! Take another sword. CANUTE. By Heaven! I hate thee more for this disdain Than for thy prowess, Edmund! Oh for vengeance! Oh for a valiant arm, bravely to rid me Of this foul shame! Ay, I would raise that arm And head, above his proudest peers! EDRIC (approaching CANUTE). What said'st thou? Say that once more, fair prince; but once again. CANUTE. Thou tempt'st meâhence! EDRIC (muttering). EnoughâI comprehend. EDMUND. Canute! betake thee to thy swordâI wait! EDRIC (aside, drawing his dagger). Now, fatal steel, come forth! and let me carve, With thy most trenchant edge, one pathway yet Towards Hope's lost beacon. Thus let me clutch thy haft! Vengeance make keen mine eye! Hate nerve my arm! [He joins a group of Danes, towards whom, in the combat, Canute is again beaten back. As Edmund aims a blow, Edric, over the shoulder of a Dane, stabs him. EDMUND. Treason! ho, treason!âSome base hand hath stabb'd me! BULLOIGN. My prince!âAlas! his lips grow whiteâthe blood Spouts forth in torrents! Lean on me. EDMUND (faintly). Once more Let me look on my Algithaâmy momentsâ Are number'dâhaste! my heart 's sickâhaste! Algitha rushes in. VOICES FROM THE CROWD. The Queen! The Queen!âMake way! ALGITHA. Whereâwhere is my husband? [Seeing, and flinging her arms round him. Ah! thou art slainâmy love! my life!âmy all! I will not leave thee! tear me not hence, hard men! EDMUND. This hurt is slightâmy loveâa scratch. I shall Be betterâquite wellâpresently. ALGITHA. Alas! Thou art dyingâseeâseeâhe grows paleâsome help! His eyes swim. Savages!âwill none bring aid? Helpâhelp! he bleeds to death. EDMUND (apart to BULLOIGN). Gently remove herâ This sight will kill herâtake her away. (To Algitha). Nay, see How strong I am! [He endeavours to walk past her. Oh! I am faintâyour handâ We meetâagainâin heavenâfarewellâIâdie! [He falls suddenly to the ground. Algitha faints on the body. CANUTE. What villain hand hath done this deed? Stand back! [All retreat except Edric, who stands moodily alone. Behold the wretch! and, witness of his crime, The fratricidal steel, reeking with gore! Seize him! What, not a word?âart stupified? EDRIC (starting). How's this? What have I done? Unhand me, sirs! [He shrinks on seeing the body. Yes, yesâI see it allâenoughâtoo muchâ I could not do 't again, though all earth's glories Sprung round my path like weeds! What mean you? Ho! Canute! your pledgeârelease me from these dogs. Off, ye base curs! thus do I spurn ye! thus! King, for whose glory I have staked my all On earth, in heavenâhere and hereafterâhear me! Your pledge, great king, your pledge! CANUTE. Eternal justice! What have my passions utter'd! Be it so. To you, my lords, I here commit this wretch, This fell, anticipating slave of sin, Who dogs the steps of passion, and outstrips The transient purpose of the hurried thought, Moulding to crime the visions of despair. Thou shalt surmount thy peers. Upon yon tower Set up a pole, higher than ever steeple Rear'd its sky-piercing vane; and, on its summit, Ere yet with hurrying foot one hour hath pass'd, Transfix his head! Traitor! away with him! EDRIC. Canute! for mercy!âGive me but a weekâ A dayâan hour, one precious hour, to shrive My sinful soul! Bring me a confessor! Not that wayânoânot thatâ! See! his eyes stareâ And in each stony ball a dÃ¦mon sits, Looking damnation on me. Ho! King Edmund! If thou art living, speak!âCanute, protect me! Spare meâI am not fit to dieâthe fiends Already pluck at meâI am not fit To die!âcrush not my soulâone moment's mercyâ I would repent! Oh agony! oh devils! [He staggers beneath their strokes. Spare meâoh spare!âIâIâam chokedâwith bloodâ A sea of blood boils o'er my lip.âAvaunt! [He creeps to the body of Edmund. Edmundâmy brother!âpardonâthy murderer. Plead for meâplead for meâwhereâthou art goneâ And Iâneverâ [He falls dead on the body.</field>
