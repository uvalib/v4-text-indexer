      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, Spoken at the Theatre in Lincolns-Inn-Fields. This Play was pretty once for ought we know, When 'twas first writ, a dozen years agoe. But Gallants what-e're 'twas when it was young; You know that Beauty seldom holds so long. But though it has not like kind Misses done, Who act so briskly, and begin so soon, That their o'relighted Beauties set e're Noon: Yet it is guilty of a greater Crime. A dozen years ago, and in its prime; And ne're launcht out till now! Pox, cryes a Wit, So long in this kind Town, and ne're tryed yet! If this Play take, my sence and judgment fayle. 'Tis an ill Face keeps Maiden-head so stale. But grant 'twas Modest, and kept off till now, A Miracle in Wit, and Woman too. No, that won't pass; refuse so long t'engage, And stoop at last t'appear upon this Stage, In a damn'd House, and in as damn'd a Dress; Like Wench debaucht in Paragon; you'd guess It had a very longing mind before, That yields at last on such an easy score. But, Faith, without fine Scenes once like a Play: You like kind Women when their Paint's away. Plays heighten'd by gay Cloaths, and gawdy Scenes, Are but like Spanish Beauties in Jappeens.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS and HIGH-BORN PRINCESS, Elizabeth, DUTCHESS OF ALBEMARLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The First Act. Scene the First a Castle. Enter Tyridates, Pheroras, Alexas, Polites, and Arsanes, Guards, Trumpets sound. Phero. Led on by your Example and Command, No Force could the IndÃ¦an Armes withstand; This Victory is to your Valour due; Your Conqu'ring Arme th'Arabian Powers or'e-threw. You the Kings Brother at his feet laid Dead; A Homage to a King severely paid. Tyrid. Your great Examples made my Duty bold; None could a Coward be, and You behold: Nor is there any thing more Triumph draws Then Loyalty link't to a Monarch's Cause. Alex. Well Valiant Conqu'rors, cease this gen'rous strife: The Justice of our Cause gave us all life. Whilst thus our selves we Conquer, and thus Knit; They embrace. The fierce Arabians to our Swords submit. Tyrid. Lead to Jerusalem! the King I'le meet, And lay my Wreaths at my great Masters feet. Manent Pol. &amp; Arsa. Exeunt Tyrid. Alex. Phero. cum suis. Pol. Not all the Laurels Tyridates wears, Nor Honours growing faster than his years; Nor Fame that swells a young Mans Spirit high Do yet clear up my Princes Cloudy Eye: A misty Melancholly on his brow Does some more deep, and silent Sorrow show: Can you Arsanes guess the Cause? Arsa. So little, that in all the search I make, The more I judge, the farther I mistake. All the Disasters which his House befell, Did never past a Moderation swell; His juster Griefs, and those so well-known Woes, He with a manly Courage did oppose. Pol. How then are now his sorrows greater grown? Can Herod's Interest move more than his own? Arsan. That grief which inward burns must needs consume,â But 'twill more Airy grow by vent and roome. You then his Governour may better move, [to Polytes. To know the Cause: He cannot disapprove That Care in you, nor will your love neglect; For he has always born you great respect. Pol. On all occasions then we must lay hold, Love prompted by necessity grows bold. [Exeunt. Enter Tyridates. Tyr. I find it is not Bus'ness can reclaime My lab'ring thoughts from an invading flame; Nor can the great Employment of the War, Intruding Loves more fierce assaults deter: Whilst I for Herod with my Sword o'recome, The Image of his Queen Kills me at Home. Not all Phraates Cruelties did move So much my Breast, as does this Tyrant, Love. Nor all the Knowledge, which I gain'd at Rome From Stoicks, this one Passion can or'ecome. How little I a Gen'rals name respect, Whilst I my Office, and my Fame neglect. Oh Gods, who now an Heretick can be Against the power of gentle Love or Thee. My panting heart, I hold no longer dear Than whilst I find Mariamne's Image here. It is my glory nothing could subdue That Heart (not force of Gods or Men) but You. Enter Polites and Arsanes. Polit. Sir, 'tis our Love which makes us thus intrude, With busie Care upon your Solitude. Arsa. In Melancholly Characters we read Some gloomy mist has your great Heart o're-spread. Your Aire, and Meine, and Looks more Cloudy grown, Though you take care to Hide it, make it Known. Polit. We hitherto have shar'd your woes and bliss, And shall we now both Strangers be to this? Are we mistrusted now?â Tyr. Polites, holdâ To you, and only you, I dare unsold That Secret which I here lockt up till now; And did disclose to none, no not to you; Because 'tis what your Councel can't remove: 'TisâO that I live to tell itâSir, 'tis Love!â Look not so strange, you'l be surpriz'd much more When you shall see her shadow I adore. [Shews a Picture. Pol. Oh Gods! What see I here?âIt cannot be! Tyr. Is Homage strange to such Divinity? Arsa. Sir, Then 'tis Herods Queen whom you adore. Tyrid. You tell me what I Knew too well before: I through your Eyes Polites see your fear; And 'tis but just those Dubious thoughts I clear. You fear that Noble Vertue is Betrayd Which rul'd my Actions whilst your Precepts swa'yd: But though I Love, 'tis with so pure a flame, As will not Innocence, nor Vertue shame! To say, I Love her more than Life, is poor, But I love Mine, and Her bright Honour more. Pol. In Love you to rewards of Love pretend. Tyrid. No, no: My Love has neither Hopes nor End; She is a Vertue that no Mortal dares Pretend to Love; unless he Vertue wears. Could I transform to any shape; yet she Cannot be tempted by a Deity. Lock up this Secret closely in your Breast. Arsa. Without your Leave it ne're shall be exprest. Pol. But Sir, does Mariamne know your flame? Tyrid. My Tongue as yet durst never giv't a name. Pol. Sir, since I doubt, it were in vain to try To reason you into a remedy: That which I can't remove, I will defend: Yet many dangers may your Love attend. Herod, a Man is of that Temper known, As Jealous of his Wife as of his Crown. He spares no blood, that He may this secure, Think not in Love, a Rival Hee'l endure. Tyrid. You can't say more than Tyridates knows, But for her sake I will my life expose. Arsa. And we with you will the same Hazard share. Tyrid. But in discourse I do my Joys defer. 'Tis the highest Tryumph that my Armes obtain, Ending the War to see the Queen again. [Exeunt. Third Scene A Chamber. Enter Mariamne, Alexandra, Cleophe, &amp;c. Mar. Mother, the force wherewith you me Invade, To a Rebellious Thought can ne're perswade. Though I no Passion for that Tyrant know, Nor Obligation to his Merits owe; I by the Sacred Law of Heav'n am taught, To habour against Herod, no ill thought. Alexand. He is a Monster, and deserves that ill. Mar. But yet that Monster is my Husband still. Alexand. He then did forfeit both the Name and Place; When He began to Murder all your Race: 'Tis He that Murder'd the Asmonean Seed; And the last Relicks of that Race made bleed. And now He has Imprison'd You and Me, For what; unless He does our Deaths decree? Mar. Death is the last of ills that he can do. Alexand. But I wou'd first that Monsters death pursue; And have the Pride before my life depart, To strike my Dagger to the Tyrants Heart. Mar. May Heav'n defend my Innocence from guilt: His blood alone shou'd by just Heav'n be spilt. I'le neither act, nor wish so great a Crime. Cleop. Who ever saw a Vertue more sublime? Alexand. Now He is gone to Rhodes, it is not hard For you to gain to our just side the Guard. You in the Peoples Love so great are grown, That for your sake they Herod wou'd Dethrone: Besides, We may by speedy Letters send For Valiant Tyridates, who's our Freind. The Army wee'l call home, and all those Powers Will be as well as Tyridates, Yours. Mar. The very hearing this in me's a Crime. Alexan. Why then you dote on him, and wish his good? Can you love Tyrants stain'd with your own blood? Mar. What now I do; you did at first command, When forc'd by You, to him I gave my Hand. Whilst that you urg'd no Crime, I did obey: With me, to Him, you gave your Power away. These Tears I shed, to Murder'd Friends I owe; [Weeps. This to weak Nature I must needs allow. Alexand. Those Tears th'Asmonians-Valiant-Race disown, And Mariamne is a Coward grown. Sit down so tamely with your Sexes fears? No marks of Courage are those foolish Tears. Mar. Though hateful Crimes I like a Coward fly, I have a Heart that's not afraid to dye. Where I may Honour, and my Duty save, I have a Courage dares the Tyrant brave. Enter Sohemus. Cleoph. See Madam, one of your Gardians, Sohemus come. Alexan. Perhaps he's come to let us know our Doom. Sohem. Madam, dry up those Tears, and Weep no more, Put this Imprisonment on safety's score: The King a Passion has so great and just; He dares to none but Us your safety trust. His Jealousie the issue is of Love. Mar. What act of mine did that base humour move? Sohem. Lovers have oft without cause Jealous been. Mar. He might have yet remembred me his Queen. Sohem. Madam, you nothing want, but Liberty. Mar. Denying that, what does he not deny? Alexan. From guilty Souls, such Jealousies arise; Herod can't live unless he Tyrannize. Mar. Sohemus knows my Husbands foul intent, When he his Voyage to Antonius went. And now he is to great Augustus gone, If he miscarriesâmust he go alone? Sohem. Your Pardon Madam, if I tell you more; And 'tis a Warrant which he Sign'd before. Seems to Whisper. He must enjoy you in another World, Thus into Crimes, by Jealousie he's hurld? Mar. This Jealousie from Malice springs, not Loveâ Sohem. It is your Vertue makes me thus your Friend: And that you may suppose my Friendship true, The power of my Head I give to you. For if this Secret from your Lips does come, Herod will make me sharer in your Doom. Mar. I weigh your kindness, you shall find me true. Sohem. Herod does not mistrust the Queen, nor You. Alexan. Why are we Prisoners then?â Sohem. It is his Care. 'Twill not be long e're Herod will return, You'l then no longer your lost Freedom mourn. Enter Philon. Mariam. Philon, thy looks speak News; what is't? Philon. They say The Valiant Prince of Parthia comes this Day, Into Jerusalem.â The City and the Court their Joys express, To see him come Crown'd with so great success. With swifter wings arriv'd his greater Fame, And told his glorious acts before he came. Mar. What are they Philon?â Philon. He has such conduct, and such valour shown; Those Storms which threatn'd us are all o're-blown: Th'Arabians are out of Judea fled; But left behind them 13 thousand dead. Twice by his Valour, He the Battle won; And twice unhors'd the King, and once his Son. He brake their Troops like lightening as he flew; Where e're he went with him, He Conquest drew. Th'Arabian King from place to place he chas'd, Till to his Country He return'd disgrac'd. Mar. I have already heard of his great Name. Philon. And yet I speak it lesser then his Fame. Mar. That Princes Vertues I did ever prize, And his praise now with my own Interest lies: If to the Kingdoms Interest I am true, I must his Vertues Love, and praise 'em too. [Exeunt. Fourth Scene the City Jerusalem. Enter Tyridates and Polites. Tyrid. Oh Gods! how can you thus unmov'd behold The best peice ever made of humane mold; The work of your own hands, giv'n up to be A subject for a Monsters Cruelty. She to whose eyes, my freedom I resign: And she has right to all the Worlds, as mine. Can she a Captive be?â Pol. Call in your Passion Sir, and give it Law. Tyrid. Of Thee Mariamne 'tis I stand in awe. Great Queen! it is thy Vertue makes me fearâ Pol. Sir stop your Passion till Arsanes come. His news may calm't, or give it farther room. Tyrid. Now Herod is her Persecutor grown, I him no longer my Protector own; His Cruelties my Brothers have out-done; I from one mischief to another run; From Parthia bring my Life to lose it here: And that which is a thousand times more dear. Herod. Herod in your distress has given you ayde. Tyrid. My Conquests have that Obligation payd. I in Mariamne's wrongs am injur'd more Then e're his Kindness had oblig'd before. My thoughts no longer shall my mind divide: Both against him, and the whole World beside, I'le draw this Sword in the Queens just defence: And succour Vertue and wrong'd Innocence. Pol. These thoughts disclos'd, wou'd Sir your self undo, Bring certain Ruine to Mariamne too. But see Arsanes is return'd againâ [Enter Arsanes. Tyrid. Quick, dear Arsanes, ease me of my pain. What says Sohemes, is he still our Friend? Arsan. I judge him so, for so he does pretend. He quickly granted part of your Request; But a long time he did debate the rest: He on Mariamnes anger did demur, Not on the Dangers that she might incur. At last the Friendship that he had for you Prevail'd; and overcome that scruple too. Now Night has spread her Sables, he does wait Alone your coming at the Castle Gate. Tyrid. This is a Kindness I can ne're requite; Assist me Darkness! Loves best Friend, is Night. Enter Sohemes with a Disguise. Sohem. Put on this Souldiers Casque for your Disguise; Thus Habited, you need not fear surprize. Tyrid. dresses in a Disguise. Philon is now to his Apartment gone, And I have newly set the Watch alone. Wee'l shun the Main-Guard lest your Face be spy'd, At this back Gate you'l enter undiscry'd. You two without, for our return must wait, But at a little distance from the Gate. [aside. Tyrid. What Tumult's this within my Breast appears! There is a strugling 'twixt my Joys and Fears. That Heart which Death and Horror did not daunt, At its approaching Bliss begins to faint. Arsan. Let's find some shelter, that's not out of Call. [Exeunt. Sixth Scene a Chamber. Mariamne's discover'd lying on a Couch. Enter Tyridates. Tyrid. See where She is! how her affections move! She thinks on nothing but the Gods above. What force of Men can such a Pow'r withstand, Whose Piety does Gods themselves Command: Mar. Defend me Heav'n; what's this I here behold! Tyr. running to her Kneels. One of my Guard so Impudent and Bold! Tyridates, ha! what does your rashness mean? Do not you know 'tis Death to see the Queen? Tyrid. Madam, I do: but dangers I defy, And I could wish them far more great, and nigh. I no occasion had till now to show How little I do value Life for you. Mar. Rise Tyridates; I and Herod know, How great a Debt we to your Valour owe. But the Kings Cruel humour gives me fear: Would your Compassion had not brought you here. Tyrid. That temper your Misfortunes do Create; I neither with his Love, nor fear his Hate. He gave me shelter in his Courtâ'tis true; But Murders now the Life he sav'd in You. Mar. I know Compassion moves you to be kind: 'Tis the Effect of every gen'rous mind. Tyrid. Give me but leave, this Sword shall set you Free. Mar. My Thoughts you cannot to Revenge incline; That is the bus'ness of the Gods, Not mine. Tyr. To do you Justice You may me permit. Mar. I Act Revenge, when I shall suffer it. Tyr. In Your Misfortunes I a share do Claim. Mar. I beg You won't that Dang'rous Claim pursue; Lest gen'rous pitty Fatal prove to You. Tyr. Ah wou'd the Gods! that Tyridates cou'd Buy off Your Sufferings Madam with his Blood: Or end Your Troubles with his Punishment, By all the Deaths that Herod could Invent. How fair would be my Fate to pay to You My Life; to whom all Hearts, all Lives, are due: [aside. Mar. Sure this from Passion, not from Pitty flowes. I wou'd not know what now I but suppose. Sir, Do you well consider what You Say? [to Tyrid. Tyr. If my rash Tongue my Passion does betray; And unawares the Secret has Confest Which has so long bin lock't within my Brest. Madam, do you adjudg what paines are Due: I'le gladly suffer what's Impos'd by You. Yes, Tyridates does as guilty Plead, Since in your clouded Brows I Anger read. Mar. You'ld not have licens'd thus your self to tell Your Folly, had you Known Mariamne well: I Herods bloody Injuries forgive; Yet scarce can pardon this OffenceâyetâLive [Exit Mar. Tyr. Stay Mariamne! Gods! What have I done? Tortures! To what Confusion am I Run! She pardons me! And yet pronounc'd my Death! She bid me Live, Yet Kil'd me with that Breath. Herod, who blushes with her Kindred's Gore, With all his Injuries ne're mov'd Her more. And is't not hard that th'oversights of Love, To Anger more then Cruelties should move? My Rashness has my blasted Joyes o're-thrown, And my distemper'd Soul melts at her Frown. [Exit. Tyr.</field>

Let it Pheroras, be your chiefest Care, That Noble Sosius be respected here With the same Homage that is due to Me. Sos. I have no Title to such Dignity. Herod. Sir, of my Friendship I wou'd give you Proof. Sos. The Glory of your Service is enough. It is my Duty, that I you Obey: To whom Augustus such respect did pay. Herod. I will not be, Kind Sir, asham'd to own; It was your Friendship did support my Crown. I great Augustus's Anger did subdue, Not so much by my Merit, as by You. Sos. My Acts, great Sir, you praise too much. Enter Tyridates and Alexas. Herod. But see; another Guardian of my Throne, Valiant defender of Judea's Crown. The Arabians dread great Tyridates name, [Embraces. And Rome has heard already of thy Fame. The Laurels always must adorn that Brow: And you participate his Glories too. [To Alexas. Tyrid. The Obligations you have on me laid, Can never by such Services be paid. Herod. Your Worth by Modesty does higher grow. Tyrid. Sir, I my Life did to your Bounty owe. Alex. This Prince begins to make my Envy boyle; For to his Lustre we seem all a Foile. [Aside Herod. Let us no more thus Modestly contend; You are my Crownes Protector, and my Freind. Tyrid. You must command [Aside] How Vertuous he seems And cunningly disguises his black Crimes? Like him I'm forc'd to Flatter with my Tongue, Whilst my wrackt Heart resents Mariamnes Wrong. Enter Philon. Herod. How does Your Charge? Phil. Great Sir, She's safe, and well. Herod. Does not Restraint make all her Passions swell? And doe not Curses sit upon her Tongue Against my Life? Phil. You do her Vertues Wrong. Herod. By Heav'n I think you are Enamor'd too. Phil. Because I've Acted what you bid me doe. Herod. It is my Passion, Philon, I forget. But with what Words did Alexandra Threat? Phil. She took it Sir as Women use to doe, An angry Tear, and a sharp Word or two. Herod. Affaires of State have smother'd up my Love, But now warm Sparks about my Heart-strings move. Spight of my Fury and my short-liv'd Rage, Mariamnes Eyes those Passions soon asswage.

Mar. Sir, I'm your Pris'ner, and must you Obey. Herod. O no Mariamne; here you still bear sway: Oh do not at this small restraint repine. Thou art no Pris'ner; but 'tis I am thine. I now have nothing else I can subdue: Fortune bows down to me; yet I, to you.â And in the greatest glory of my Pride Can Loveâand see my self of Love denyed. Alexan. We do believe you Herod, 'tis enough. That you are kind, this Prison is the proof. Herod. Your words too lavish were, when I was by, For me to trust you, when I was not nigh. I here secur'd you in my absence; true. But it was done in Courtesie to you. Lest a Temptation to Assault my Crown Might make you, on your Head, pull Vengeance down. Alexan. Then our Imprisonment's a trick of State. Herod. Wisemen fore-see, and often Master Fate. Alexan. I'm glad I know that Herod is so Wise. Herod. But you the Jewel that I only prize, [to Mariam. Above my Life or Crown, lock't safely here, Trusted to those, you had no need to Fear; Have yet less Cause to Murmur or Repine, Knowing my Life depended upon Thine. Maria. You may with me do what to you seems good; But you might yet have spar'd Hircanus Blood: Sure your affection's built on a strange ground, Which on my Kindreds Graves it self does found. Herod. From that old Root, such Branches wou'd have sprung, Who from my hands my Scepter would have wrung. And I should both my Life and Crown Betray, Had I not par'd that dang'rous Root away.

What cloudy Blacks my Heart and Visage wear, And Love it self's scarce greater than my Fear. To mighty Love all Passions else submit, Grow calme, and are to Tempests rais'd by it. So it Usurps the Empire of the mind And Governs there, as o're the Seas the Wind. Whilst it blows gently, Seas as Gently lye; But when it Storms, they Storm and Rave as high. Enter Salome at a distance. Solom. He's thereâ I will not lose the occasion nowâ StayâI'le advise, first what I have to do. Oh Heavens, must then this great Heart stoop so low; And must he from my Mouth my Passion know. Vertue, where art thou?âor where art thou Shame? TushâShame's for MaidsâVertu's an empty name. I Love, and I am scorch'd so with the fire, That all things now must yeild to my desire. âVertue, and Honour, all things else lye by. 'Tis Love o'recomes, and I must speak, or dye.â Tyrid. My Passions did disturb enough before. [Aside. Thy Company will yet disturb me more. I cannot shun her. Salom. Tyridates here! I did not think such happiness so near! I doubt I on your Privacy intrude. Tyrid. I am not busie, Madam! Salom. But I am Rude. What were your Thoughts? Tyrid. On nothing? Salom. Is that all? Tyrid. I view'd those Artfull Pictures on the Wall. Salom. Their Story, Sir, you may not understand: I will Interpret themâLend me your hand; Such a Commanding awe hangs on his brow Aside. It daunts me, and my Tongue does faulter now. Aside. The World here Tyridates found its Grave, And none escaped, but what that Ark did save. Tyrid. We by our Stories, Madam, understood The World once suffer'd by a general Flood. Salom. Here is the man, who did our Nation Free By Miracles from Ãgypts Slavery: See there what Vengeance he on Pharoah throws; Though all his great Magicians do opposeâ See where the King pursues him in his Pride. Here, at his Word the Seas themselves divide: Here Pharoah still pursues them with his Host.â Look thereâthe King, and all his Army's lost.â Has not the Painter here expres't his skill? How well in Death he Frowns, and Threatens still. Tyrid. Madam! I doubt I too much trouble youâ Salom. I take delight in'tâSir, in Truth I do.â When I look on him, all my Courage fails: Aside. And o're my Resolutions fear prevailes. Aside. Your Eyes a little on this Captain lend: He Conquer'd first this Land, you now Defend. The Sun stood still, and did his Word obey; And gave the World a most Prodigious Day. Tyrid. Will none come hither to Release me yet?â [Aside. 'Twill take up too much time to view 'em all. Salom. One or two more; you needs must seeâyou shallâ Oh that I had my Story-once begun! [Aside. See here two Kings, the Father and the Son: That's David, the best Captain of his Time: This Salomon, whose Wisdom was sublime. Wise, as he was; yet that Wise Salomon Did not disdayn to put Love's Fetters on: And to that Queen which hangs close by his side, No coldness shew'd, nor Love, for Love deny'd: His Fame far off had kindl'd am'rous fires; He Lov'd, and satisfi'd her warm desires. Tyrid. It was but just; and to so Fair a Queen, He would have otherwise ungrateful been. Salom. Whilst thus you pass your judgment Sir on them; Consider that your self you do Condemn. You to a Princess have appear'd too Rude, And for true Love return'd ingratitude. Though she has left no Realms to visit you, Yet that which is more hard, she does pursue. She treads on Dangers, and for you she dies, And Liberty more dear then Empire flies. Tyrid. I may believe my Miseries might move In tender Breasts some Pittyâbut not Loveâ I am an Exile, no Retreat do know But what I to your Brothers Bounty owe. That Princess then in Herod's Court may see Objects more worthy of her self than Me. Salo. With willful blindness You Obligements slight; That you may shun occasions to requite. Tyrid. My great Misfortunes Madam, make me blind. Salo. No Tyridates, 'tis Disdayn I find: And you are too clear-sighted not to know, That you are Lov'd, and who 'tis Loves you too. No Soul, but Hers, could have endur'd that pain, Caus'd by the Tyranny of your Disdayne. Tyrid. Such worth I dare not to my self apply, Nor look up at a Fortune that's so high; And though your glorious Beauty shou'd descend, To grant me all the Charms that Love can lend: My mind does under such misfortunes bow, I could not have the power to taste them now. Salo. You for your coldness have a fine pretext; You'l be no more with such Discourses vext. And since you with affection are opprest, That Importunity shall be redres't: Fury's the steps of incens'd Lovers guide; And Love converts to Hate, with scorn deny'd. [Ex. Salom. Tyrid. Thy Love and Hate are both alike to me. What difference 'twixt Mariamne is, and Thee? I her denyal better do approve: Which less torments me than thy proffer'd Love. Her Anger looks with so much Innocence; That though it kills, it cannot give offence. And were not Love by Vertue clear'd in Me, I'd hate the name of Love, as I do Thee. Enter Polites and Arsanes. Would you had come soonerâ All that Misfortune that I so much fear'd, Just now with Impudence enough appear'd. For Salome her self, the secret told. Arsa. But I perceive your Answer was but cold. Pol. That Coldness has incens'd Her; for but now, We saw a raging scorne inflame her brow; With all the marks that do on Fury wait. Tyrid. It is not Love, but Lust that turns to hate. Arsan. The King's return'd, and will this Night be seen In publique t'entertain his welcome Queen. Tyrid. What, then the Queen's Releas't? Polit. Yes Sir; 'tis true. And Herod seems enamour'd now anew. He gazes on her with Affection still: You'd think 'gainst her he never dream't an ill. Tyrid. Thanks Fate! I'le be my self a Guest to Night: And at her Eyes direct my wondring sight. What Nobler Object to exalt my Joy? Unless my Envy does my Joyes destroy: Of what I wish that Tyrant is possest? I can but gaze on Banquets where he Feasts. [Exeunt. Enter Salome Sola. Salom. 'Tis doneâI am resolv'dâI'le Love no moreâ But Hate as much as e're I Lov'd before. With what kind warmth does now my Anger move? And dear Revenge tasts sweeter far then Love. The Poets say that Love in Heav'n does dwell; If so, then there more Pleasure is in Hell. For though the Furies whip and lash my mind; Yet in that Rage I secret Pleasure find. Thou at my Feet shall unregarded lye, Who with disdain a Princess could'st deny. I Tyridates, will pluck down thy Pride: Let Hell and all its Furies be my guide. Enter Philon. Phil. Madam, The King and Queen's already sate, They and the Revels do your presence wait. Your place stands Emptyâ Salo. Revels are a sport For Loving Fools: Blood is the Mirth I'le Court: I'le follow;âRage has so posses't my mind, I no Diversion but in that can Find. [Exeunt.</field>

Slighted I thought was a sufficient Curse; But slighted for another is yet worse; Swell high the Tyde of Rage; boyle up my Blood, Be to my Vengeance an eternal Food. Is it for this that Mariamne flyes, The Kings Embrace? and does his Love despise! I have a Rival on an equal score, The Queen a Husband has, and I no more.

With your own mouth you wou'd divulge your shame; To Do and to be Tempted is the same. We must be free from scandal as the fault. Men judge the strength of Vertue by th'Assault.

I would not have you Tyridates save; Your resolution is both just and brave. Yet for his Life, pray venture not your Crown, Nor hazard for his wicked head your own. Augustus Sir, is Tyridates Friend, It's dangerous Augustus to offend. And lose the favour which you gain'd so late; Act not in Fury, let your Rage abateâ Herod. What, shall he live then? Salom. No: he still shall dye. But 'tis not you shall strike the blowâbut I. Leave it to meâ Herod. But give your Justice wings: Revenge that brooks delays too mean for Kings. At my Queens head shall my next Thunder fly, Who could not live and Love by Hate shall dye: Her forfeit-head, and her declining Crown Shall feel the rage of Monarchs when they frown. [Exit. Salom.

So now I feel the Floods of Rage return, And I a-new inflam'd with Anger burn. Thou to thy Husbands Kindness false art grown, And Love, my due, is on a Stranger thrown. Has Tyridatesâ Are you Surpriz'd! has Guilt lock't up your Tongue? Mar. No Herod, 'tis the greatness of the Wrong. Herod. Traytress, 'tis falseâ But to my Wrath he shall a Victim fall; And you shall quickly follow tooâyou shall!â Mar. Herod, believe all that you please; the worst I've born already by thy Kindness Curst. Herod. Perfidious Womanâ His Ruine shall begin your Punishment. Mar. If you on Blood and Murder thus are bent: If Rage no otherwise appeas'd can be, Seek out no other Sacrifice but Me. Resolve my Murder, but his Ruine spare, Who has in my Imputed Crimes no share: Herod. To such a height it seems your Love is flown, His Life you value, though you slight your own; In Tyridates thou shalt tortur'd be, Before thou know'st what I resolve on Thee. [Ex. Mar. Death thou art Welcome: come when e're thou wilt, Those Souls fear not thy Dart who feel no Guilt: Yet Tyridates, Thee I wish remov'd, Because your greatest Crime is that you Lov'd. [Exit.

What is't that makes thee shake! hast, give me mine! [To the Attendant that fills the Wine. Long live the King, and whilst the Health goes round, Command without that the lowd Trumpets sound. Enter Arsanes, who dashes the Bowl out of Tyridates hand. Arsan. Pardon my hast, Sir, and vouchsafe your ear. Alex. 'Tis prevented! Pher. Discover'd too I fear. Let us not stayâ Alex. The King will Orders give, Though this Plot has not took, he shall not live! Ex. Alexas &amp; Pheroras. Arsan. That Rudeness Sir I acted with my will. For it was Poyson that I made you spill! Philon by chance behind the Arras got, Heard Salome and Alexas lay this Plot. He told the Queen, whose Kindness sent him strait With this, to let you know your Threaten'd Fate. gives a Letter. Pheroras and Alexas Sir are gone, And they by this themselves have Guilty shown. Leave usâ [Exit Attend. Tyrid. See here Arsanes what the Queen has Writ,â She bids me quickly save my self by flight. Nay, instantly I must be goneâto Night: Or else so closely they my Life pursue; The Sword will act what Poyson cannot do. I know not which more Joy or Grief does bring, This Favour, or the baseness of the King. Arsan. Sir, do not trifle thus away your time, To make her Warning useless were a Crime: Tyrid. What wou'd you have me doe? Arsa. O Sir, be gon! Tyrid. That thought's too hard. Arsa. Sir; if you stay, her Kindness you neglect, And pay to her Commands but small respect. Tyrid. 'Twas her compassion of my Life took Care, She did not know her Presence is more dear. Enter Sohemus. Must I my Life, or Mariamne quit? Soh. Yes Sir, 'tis but too certain, and your Flight Must speedy be, or else you both will lose. Consult no further, Her Commands obey: For know that her you Ruine, if you stayâ Therefore no longer on your stay demur; This rising storme does rather threaten Her. But She in your Escape, Preserv'd may be When you remove the Cause of Jealousy. Enter Polites. Pol. O Sir be speedy in your flightâI hear Alexas, and the Kings Life-guard are neer. Soh. Good Sir, make haste. Pol. There's hardly time for Flight. Arsa. But we may now be favour'd by the Night. Tyrid. Well! must I goe?âOh Queen, when I obey, I'm only by your safety forc'd away. [Exeunt. Enter on the other side with drawn Swords, Alexas and Souldiers. Alex. The Traytors gone! but yet he can't be far; You soon his passage in the Streets may bar: Go light some Torches, search out every where: Who finds him first, shall of my bounty share: This Sword then Tyridates shall pursue Thy Life, and take what Poyson could not do. [Exeunt. Fourth Scene The City Jerusalem. A Cry within! here, here, they are. Enter Tyridates, Polites, Arsanes, Retreating and Fighting, Alexas, Guard, Souldiers pursuing. Alex. Yeild Tyridates, or thy Life is lost! Tyrid. That thou took'st it away, thou shalt not boast! Take that for thy Wives Treachery. [Kills Alexas. Alex. Though I am wounded! Soudiers follow still. You dye, if him you neither Take nor Kill. [Polites falls. Tyrid. Farewell, thy Friendship does my Love out-vye; Thou hast the Honour in her Cause to dye. [to Polites. Arsanes come! Let us Revenge his Blood, And take the Fate which cannot be with-stood. [Fight agen; some of the Souldiers are Slain.] Enter Pheroras with fresh supplies, who beat off Tyridates and Arsanes. [Exeunt all Fighting. Fifth Scene Herods Pallace. Enter Herod and Salome with Attendants. Herod. I'le think that Heav'n does joyn against me too, If neither Poyson, nor the Sword will do. Salom. It was but chance, or he had drunk his last. Herod. I hope by this time that his Life is past. I bid Pheroras bring the welcome News, But his long stay my Patience does abuse. Salom. What Devil was it mov'd Arsanes so, The Bowl, the Wine, and Poyson to o'rethrow.â Between that Draught and Death he should have known, I rais'd that storm which hence his Life had blown. 'Tis not Revenge, at least not half so sweet, Unless he knows that I the Conquest get. And if he Falls now by Alexas hand, My fatal Anger he will understand: [Enter Pheroras. But here's Pheroras nowâ Herod. How dy'd he! say? Pher. His Valour Sir has rather won the dayâ Herod. Hah! Whatânot brought with thee the Traytors Head! How durst thou say to me he is not dead! What Legions had he to defend his Life? Or fought my Subjects for him in the strife? Pher. I saw Alexas Sir, his Life pursue! But what is't Valour in Distress can't do? Surrounded by the Guard he bravely fought, And to the ground Alexas bleeding brought. Salom. What said you of Alexas? Herod. Peace; go on! Pher. At him the Guard with all their fury run. But like a Heroe so unmov'd he stood, That all around the place he stayn'd with blood. Polites Slayn, with noble Anger stung, He flung himself to dye amid'st the Throng. There he such Prodigies of Valour shew'd, The Guard not him, but he the Guard pursu'd. Prest with their number, he at last had dy'd, But that Arsanes an advantage spy'd. The Sacred Temple being nigh,â To that Asylum both yet fighting, fly. And spite of all those Swords which did oppose, There they escap'd the Fury of their Foes. Herod. O Heavens! escap'd me thus.â Thy Blood yet Tyridates must asswage The vehement Tempest of my Jealous Rage: I'le to the Temple, and my Wrath shall make The great Foundations of that Structure shake. [Exit. Salom. What Stars Protect this Man? His Valour moves me so, I love him still: But he Dispises me; that thought is Hell. Yes, thou shalt dye! My hand shall more then his, thy Life pursue, And shew what Woman in Dispair can do. [Exit. Sixth Scene The Temple: In which is discovered, as within the Gate, the Priests, Tyridates, and Arsanes. 1. Priest. We do not Sir enquire of your offence, No Criminal is ever forced from hence. 2 Priest. You are both safe and welcomeâ Tyrid. Thanks are due Both to the God you Worship, and to you. Enter Herod, Pheroras, and Attendants. 1. Priest. Sir, Though a King, keep back: 'tis just that you Bring that respect which to this Place is due. Her. Give me that Traytor then; this Place nor you Cannot protection to such Crimes allow. 1 Priest: O Sir! you know the Priviledge of this place. We should our Honour and our Laws disgraceâ Herod. Then I will force him hence. Pher. Your Passion sway. Offers to draw, Pher. stays him. Great Sir, let Rage to Reason once obey: All the whole race of Priests wou'd rather dye, And you, although their King, to death defie, E're they would suffer this,âbesides the Jews Would run into Rebellion at the News. Try if you can perswade, but do not force. Herod. I mustâbut yet I first will try that course; Put forth that Traytor, and you will do well; You ought not to protect an Infidel. His very presence does the place abuse; It is a Refuge only to the Jews. 1 Priest. We dare not Sir, they would us Partial call. This Temple does a Refuge yield to all. Herod. But that Barbarian durst violate The Rights of Hospitality and Faith; Ancient as Fanes themselves.â Return him fairly forth whilst I entreat, Else I will execute more than I threat. 2 Priest. First for his safety we our Lives will pay. Tyrid. Rather then you shall suffer, I'le not stay: No: let me fall a Victim to the King Rather then Ruine to your Altars bring. Arsan. O Sir! what do you mean. 1 Priest. You will do worse, You on our Altars will pluck down a Curse. Let the King raze our Fane: our Bloods be spilt. 'Twere better to fall Pure, then stand with Guilt. Tyrid. Let me speak to the King.â Arsa. I'le not refuse So you no further go. Tyrid. King of the Jews, I am a Prince, and meet you without odds, For I know no Superior but the Gods; I scorne to justifie my self to you, Who thus ignobly do my life pursue. A Life which from thy Sword and Poyson flyes, Here at the Altar thou would'st Sacrifice, Against all Right, both Humane and Divine. Herod. Yes, I will have thy Life, though I lose mine. Tyrid. Not the most faulty of my thoughts e're meant Mariamne or thy wrong; thy Innocent And injur'd Queen I as the Gods esteem, Can that wear any Title to a Crime? Herod. In idle words I'le lose not breath nor time. Tyrid. I speak not this thy Fury to asswage, Or with design t'escape thy bloody rage; Or to delay the Death thou threaten'st here. No Herod; I can dye, but cannot fear. Herod. No, no, false man! thy artificial words The Temple nor 100000 Swords, Shall sheild thy Life from my armed Anger now. Thee and that Traytress both to death I Vow. Tyrid. Involve not yet in my imputed Crime, An Innocence which wholly is sublime: If thou before these Reverend Flamines here. Wilt Solemnly at the high Altar Swear, I shall thy only mark of Fury be, And thy blind Rage extend to none but me: I'le leave this place to which I now am fled, And to thy Vengeance render up my head. Herod. O Heav'ns, for him she wou'd have Life resign'd, And he again for her has Life declin'd: They LoveâOh Rageâ [stamp. No Traytor, thou shalt me no Council give; Nor you, nor Sheâwhom thou woud'st save shall live. [Draws. Enter Sosius with Romane Souldiers. Sosius. Hold Herod, hold, I in Augustus name, Do for the Parthian Prince a freedom clayme; He not thy Subject hither fled for aid, Must not by thy blind Fury be betray'd: In this I Justice,âHonour, Friendship show To Tyridates Vertues, and to youâ Herod. Friend! hear me firstâ Sosius. I am by Honour swayd; And in great CÃ¦sars name must be obey'd. Herod. You are a Friend to me, and I to you. Sosius. I for no Friendship will injustice do: I bear a Romans Vertue in my Breast, Friendship not linck'd with Vertue, I detest. And Tyridates you must yeild to meâ Tyrid. Where I find so much Vertue, I agree. Sosius. Herod! your unjust Fury now asswage: I here my Honour for you both engage; Herod your Life by no Plots shall betray; And you t'increase his Fury shall not stay. You from Jerusalem this Night shall go, And leave within 6 days Judea too: Who breaks his Word, begets a Foe of me, Makes Rome and CÃ¦sar too his Enemy. Tyrid. I will comply, though death I'd kindlier choose. Herod. Sosius alone could my just Vows oppose: I see my Fear is greater then my Rage; I in this quarrel dare not Rome ingage: Nor dare to my yet tott'ring Fortune trust, But I must rule by seeming to be just.

Though my Intents with Innocence are clad, The ills You suffer by them make em bad. Mar. Your business? Tyrid. Can I fly and leave you here, Expos'd to Herods Rage, and jealous fear? I'le break those Chaines my heedless Passions drewâ With such a black Ingratitude on You. Herod, by Sword and Poyson sets me free From all the Tyes of Hospitality! I this without Ingratitude can doe I owe not now my Life to Him, but You. Reject not then the succour I propose, Whence to You freedome, to me, Glory Flowes. Mar.

Can you condemn me, most Unfortunate, To Banishment for ever, and not hate? Mar. Perhaps th'affection that I'ave shown to you, Has not been such as you pretended to. I to your Merits always gave their due, As far as my Condition would allow. Had I been free, and at my own dispose, I before all had Tyridates chose. Tyrid. Oh all ye Gods! how dubious is my Fate! At once how Glorious, and how Desolate! I have now, 'tis true! no Reason to complain; Yet in my former Wretchedness remain. Those eyes must never more upon me shine, Yet I can neither murmur, nor repine. Mar. Pitty begins too much to move my heart, I find by these it is high time to part! [Mar. Weeps.

What sting is this to an Imperial mind, Thus in his will and power to be confin'd? Salom. Herod's a King, and does Judea swayâ But he's no King, who others does obey. Salom. Though many Passions grow within your Breast, I see Ambition's greater then the rest. And fear to lose your new acquired Crowne Th'aspiring boldness of the rest pulls downe! This made a Monarch to a Romane stoop, When the whole Forces of his Rage were up. Herod. 'Tis Wisdom to submit to greater Powers: Salom. None should be greater in your Realm then Yours; You this affront in Wisdom may put by, Sit tamely downeâBut King so will not I! For he shall fall my Victim, and in this I will perform what Kings but faintly wishâ But How, Do You proceed with your ungrateful Queen? Herod. I've sent for Her. Salom. To ask her Pardon. Herod. No. But that her Doom she from my Breath may Know. Enter Philon. What says our Haughty Queen? Philon. She'le wait on You, When she has first paid to her God his due. She's busie yet. Herod. At Prayers: Yes, and 'tis time. But Heaven may stay, her absence is a Crime: Bid her make hast, and let her Understand I now no more entreat Her, but Command. Phil. I Shall. [Exitt Salom. This was like Herod and a King; But yet I fear her Eyes such Forces bring, Which she still manages with such an Art, They will regain your undefended Heart. Herod. No, Though tame Love did once my Heart engage, I have now resign'd this Royal Seat to rage! Enter Mariamne and Cleophe. Salom. She's here I must retire. Thy Lover Queen shall share thy Sufferings, My Jealousy can kill as well as Kings. [Exit. Herod. See with what Noble Pride she steps? That State So like a Queen, as yet I cannot hate! Not all the marks of Anger that I bear Can shake this Womans Soul into a fear! I must no longer pauseâ You had obey'd us straight, Had you not been retarded by your hate. Mar. Any to hate the Laws of Heaven forbid! Else 'twere but Justice Herod if I did. Herod. You Queen have yet no Reason to complain, My Love it is that proves your greatest pain. Mar. What are those Signalls of your Love you boast? Herod. The World the Greatness of my Love can Read, In that you still proud Queen do wear your Head, After your Love to Tyridates shown, And his to you so publiquely made Known. Mar. My Innocence still wears a Robe so White, That I esteem Your Accusations light. Herod. I say that you still Live shews Love enough. Mar. But of your Love I have another proof: You can't forget the Compliment you sent When You to Antony and CÃ¦sar went. You sent me Word, with Grief you left meâtrueâ For had you Dy'd I must have follow'd too. Was this th'Effect either of Love or Hate, That both our Lives must have an Equal Date? Herod. I am Betray'd! Undone! Those who my Trust into my Bosome drew, Forsake me and betray my Secrets too. To what Extremities am I reduc'd, By Slaves and a Disloyal Wife abus'd: Mariam. I by Imprudence now have rais'd a storm, [aside. I doubt my Philon and Sohemus harm. Herod. I my Intentions never will deny; I did intendâif I didâyou should dye. It was excess of Loveâ Mar. Of Jealousie and Hate!â Herod. Those Traytors who my Secrets did relate, Did not for nothing so great hazard run, Expose themselves by me to be undone; And buy your favour with their Lives expence, If you had not propos'd a Recompence: Which seem'd so great and glorious in their eyes, They to obtain it, me, and life despise. Mar. What recompence had I to give? Herod. I know No gifts could ever undermine them so: Such mean things never could their Faith surprize! No Traytress; by the Charmes of those false eyes, They were seduc'dâ Mar. I will acquit them, they are Innocent: 'Twas Heaven reveal'd to me thy black intent. Herod. Thou usest thus thy Lovers to excuse, And dost thy Husbands Love and Bed abuse! Mar. Believe what e're thou wilt against me now, The baseness of your Soul and Birth you show. I scorn thee now so muchâthat I disdainâ To stoop so low, to speak to thee again: Or any more my Innocence defend Against th'unworthy Crime which you pretend. Herod. 'Twould be in vainâI now will Justice do, Yes! you shall suffer, and your Lovers too! If all the Torments of the Rack will do? Truth by that Tryal quickly will appear; What do you smile? my Guard without there [Enter Guard. Here! Safely the Queen to the great Prison bear. On pain of Death, away. Mar. Touch not my hand, I willingly obey his kind command. [Exeunt Queen &amp; Guards. Herod. Still the same Queen! still the same port she bears, And not one look of fear nor horror wears! Enter Salome and Pheroras. My Fatal Love thus long has made me blind, And with false Errors preposses't my mind; But her high Pride shall feel: Pheroras haste! And make you Joseph and Sohemus fast. Let them be Rack'd till they the truth declare. Pher. They shallâ [about to goe. Herod. Hold! Joseph from the Rack we spare: We will some method in our Anger take; He's Marry'd to our Aunt, and for her sake, Let him escape the Rack, but Strangl'd be; Be goneâlet it be done immediately.â Salom. Sir, seize on Philon, he knows her Intrigues; A great Contriver in her amorous Leagues. Herod. See He be tortur'd tooâ And forc'd by pains the hidden Truth to tell: I to the utmost will my Wrath pursue. After they're Rack'dâlet'em be strangl'd too. Away: let it be done before you sleep. [Exit Phero. Salom. O Sir! I see 'tis difficult to keep Our selves with all the helps of humane Art, From those misfortunes Heav'n will still impart. Appearances delude a humane fight, But Treason cannot always walk in Night. Herod. This Woman to my mind distraction brings; And on the Rack my tortur'd Soul she flings. Salo. 'Tis plain! no small things could their Faiths remove, They could not stoop at ought below her Love. But were this Amorous League a dubious thing; It is enough! she dares affront her King: In that unlawfull Love which she dares own To Tyridates.â But where's that height of Pride she did pretend, When she can to a Subjects Love descend. Herod. What shall I do? Salom. 'Tis fatal Love, your troubles does Create: O Sir, but strip your Princely Soul from that Which with dark shaddows over-hangs your mind, And makes you to your chiefest Interest blind; You soon will be from all Vexations freed, When Traytors justly for their Treason bleed. Herod. Yes, Mariamne soon should lose her head, But that I CÃ¦sar and the People dread. Salom. Never let that keep your great Soul in awe, Salve it with Justice; let her dye by Law: Let there some Process be against her fram'd: Some Reverend Judges in Commission nam'd. Herod. I am resolv'd nowâand the way is good, It is the Law, not Herod, spills her blood. She, who reduc'd me to this shame and fear, Shall as a Subject at the Bar appear! [Enter Alexandra. Salom. But here comes one! though often Proud and High, Falls down as poorly in Adversity. You'l not be mov'd with Tears!â Herod. No, nor with Prayers. Salom. But I'le be goneâTheir Lives my Joys debar: Revenge to thee! to thee! I'le Altars rear. [Exit. [Alex. kneels and weeps: Alex. O Sir! take pitty, I your Grace implore; Deny not one, who never Kneel'd before. Herod. Peace! 'tis in vain; nor Tears, nor Words shall do, And you deserve to share her Ruine too! Alexan. I will not rise unless you grant her Life. Herod. No more! She is a Disobedient Wife. Alexan. I'le grant itâyet some mercy show. Herod. Away. No Tears; nor Prayers shall my arm'd Justice stayâ Alexan. I'le follow youâ Herod. My Guard without there!âhere! [Enter Guard. This Woman quickly to her Chamber bear, And keep her safe. Alexan. O see: I beg agen! [kneels. I do submitâ Herod. Hast, quickly take her in. Alexan. O Jealous Husband! O thou wilful Wife! 'Tis cruel Death I see must end this strife. If thou had'st but Obedient been to me, Herod had had that Death he gives to Thee. [Ex. with Guards. Herod. Still! still Confusion in my breast does roll, And I feel mighty struglings in my Soul. The Queens Death only satisfies my mind: And yet in that Reluctancy I find. [Exit. Enter Pheroras reading Papers, and Salome. Salom. Are the Kings Orders then obey'd? Pher. They are! Salom. This hast bespeaks your Loyalty and Care. Pher. Here's their Confessions. [gives 'em Salome. Tortures made them tell What they before could by no force reveal. Salom.

But much of this must not be seen by him: They justifie her more then they condemne! In mid'st of all their Torments they seem bold, And have the Truth to her advantage told. But say Pheroras, dy'd they all like men? Pher. They dy'd as if they were to live agen: And did with so much Courage yeild their breath, As made me almost too in Love with Death: If any sorrow in their Looks were shown, 'Twas for the Queens hard fate, and not their own.

To Rome I now my wand'ring steps must lead; I've sworn, and my great Saint must be obey'd: Doom'd from her sight, he now Judea flyes, Who in Devotion to Mariamne's eyes, Liv'd an Adorer, and a Pilgrim Dies. But what high Bliss my Vowes to me deny; Hast my Arsanes, to the City fly. Enquire her health; I fear she's in distress, The trembling of my Soul her ills express. By secret Concord Lutes when tun'd alike; One trembling moves, if you the other strike. Thus my tun'd Heart by sympathy of Love Does at those ills she feels, though distant, move. Not Death, nor Herod's Cruelties I fear, But the Queens last command that keeps me here. Arsa. I'le put on the Disguise I have within. Tyrid.

'Tis a bus'ness strange and new. The Queenâ Tyrid. Oh that blest name! Salom. Has found too lateâ Tyrid. You raise my fears. Salom. A sence of her hard fate!

And though a while unmov'd; She stood the Tyrants first, and easier frowns, Who floats above weak streams, in rougher, drowns. Her nearer Ruine (though no doubt she still Esteems yee) does her breast with horror fill. She raves, and wishes that black hour accurst, In which she saw, and knew, and lov'd you first.

Hold, hold! 'tis not by thee I will be slain. I come not hither by the Queens command, Yet still this Traytor falls by my just hand. By Princess Salome I'm sentâ [offers at Tyrid. Her and her Brothers honour I must right: It is in both their Causes that I fight. Arsa. Why from the Queen did you pretend before? Salom. The Prince I knew did her so much adore, That calmely then he would his life resigne, And so I might take his, not hazard mine. Arsa. Oh Monsterâ [offers at her. Tyrid. Stay! the Cause is chang'd, and I'le dispute my Fate; And give you what you ask; Herod I hate, But Salome much moreâ Salom. Hates he her moreâ Then Herod?âmy Revenge swell'd high before: But now to kill or dye's an equal part: False &amp; Perfidious Traytor! at thy heart: [Her Perriwig falls off in making a Pass at Tyrid. Tyrid. Ha! 'Tis her self. Salom. Oh Curs't discovery! yes Sir! 'tis I, And once again I thee to Death defy! Tyrid. What Vision's this? you have disarm'd me now. Why, Madam, all this Cruelty from you? Salom. Oh my false Heart! I feel my rage expire, At one kind breath my new-blown Love takes fire. Sir, I'le forgive; if you'le return and Love, I Herod's wrath, your dangers will remove, And bring you back agen to his esteem. Tyrid. Yes, I will Love!â Salom. How Sir! Tyrid. My Charming Queenâ Salom. Your Charming Queen! your Charming Queen shall dye! I instantly will to her Tyrant flye: Accuse her of all Treasons, false, or true; All is too little that Revenge can do: She dies to Morrow, nay to Night, to Day: I cannot soon enough her life betray. And since no other way will do't, I will Torment thy Heart through Mariamne still. And thou shalt live to hear this news Proclaim'd, She's Dead: and if my pow'r can do it, Damn'd. [offers to go. Tyr. Stay, Salome; dear Salome! Salom. Your will. Tyrid. If blood's your ayme; here Tyridates kill, Let her but liveâ Salom. No, loving Fool, she dies. Tyrid. Oh thou black malice! wert thou but a man, I by thy Death would my Queens safety gain. But Curse she is a Woman! oh 'tis hard, That Justice should by honour be debarr'd: The greatest weakness is the strongest guard. Salom. Sir, 'Tis not yet too late your Queen to save, Could you butâ Tyrid. Butâwhat is it you would have? Salom. Your Love! Tyrid. Love, Madam, has Variety! What Love is't you would have? to what degree: Salom. I'd have youâOh your blindness and my shame! Can you not guess the thing without the name? Tyrid. Ah, Madam! if you Lawless thoughts pursue, The ills you save her from will fall on youâ Horrors will haunt yee!â Salom. You do not understand A Lovers sence. In Love we are not pain'd With th'ills we've acted, but in those we miss. Repentance there's less Torment, then a wish. Try but to Love me, 'tis an easie grant: Speak some kind things; or if new words you want T'express a Passion by; oblige my Ear, And repeat somthing that you said to her. Tyrid. Madam! what would your abused fancy get If I that do not Love should Counterfeit. The first I cannot, and the last I scorn: My thoughts are never in Disguises worne. I cannot tell yeeâ Salom. No, nor can I hear? I've said too much for a return so small: But here once more my Fury I recal. Since Plots on Tyridates vain do prove, To take away thy Life, or gain thy Love: Thy Heart I yet have one way left to break; My Vengeance at the Queen its ayme shall take: There I will stab thee in a tender part, And through her Breast strike thy ungrateful heart. [Ex. Sal. Tyrid. Thy kindness and thy threats I both despise; But oh her rage at Mariamne flyes. I'le to the Court, and instantly informe My Queen, and be her guard against this storme. What if I'de sworn a thousand Oaths and broke Them all, her certain Ruine to revoke? Yet Perjury's no sin in such a Case; Kind Salome! thy Malice is a Grace: Thy Cruelty has done an act so brave, It gives me pow'r my Queen to see, and save. By such a hand so great a Bounty given! An Instrument of Hell has lent me Heav'n. [Exit. Second Scene A Bed-Chamber. Mariamne lying on a Couch sleeping, Cleophe by. Enter Herod. Herod. See where she lies; her eyes chain'd up with sleep: The Graces in her Face a Guard do keep: With what serenity she does appear: How calme her Soul is, not disturb'd with fear. While mine feels horrors! Oh my heart! I must Withdraw, least to my self I prove unjust. For those almighty Charms her Beauty wears, Spread for my Anger, and my Justice snares. [stands aside. Mar. O Cleophe! my Rest hast pleasant been, [Awakes. In sleep I have a blessed Vision seen! Souls undisturb'd when they lye down to rest, Are often with such fair Idea's blest. I find Heav'n may in Prisons be; whilst Hell, And all its Furies in the Pallace dwell! Wipe off your Tears, and be not so unkind! Your weakness Cleophe disturbs my mind. Let Death and Fortune threaten if they will: What though I fall? I am above 'em still. [Enter 3 Judges Herod. Oh thou Heroick mind! not startl'd yet? See how she does unmov'd, undaunted sit! 1 Judg. Madam! by this Commission we are sent, In which we obey our Royal Kings Commandsâ You are accus'd by Himâ Mar. Vain Rudeness! hold! Me-thinks you are too insolent and bold! A Princess of my Birth, your Lawful Queen, Heir to the Crown, and stoop so low? Can you be Subjects and my Judges too? 2 Judg. We from the King, Madam, this power receive! Mar. The King himself has not so much to give. For He can never make my Spirit bow To such a base submission crav'd by you. 3 Judg. 'Twill be your Glory if you're Innocent. Mar. My Soul ne're knew what to be guilty meant! Excepting Heav'n I other Judges scorn: But chiefly you, who are my Subjects born. Therefore forbearâ 1 Judg. Madam! we know What to your Birth and quality we owe: Which hitherto we with respect have paid. The King on us has this Injunction laid: To whom it is our Duty to obey; And you as well as we should homage pay: You'l guilty seem, if you do this refuse. Queens ought to clear themselves when Kings accuse. Mar. But I from his Authority, and yours, Appeal to Higher and more Righteous Powers. 2 Judg. Our Conscience guides us, and the Law. Mar. But whyâ All these Formalities to make me dye? My Friends to Death without these shows were sent. May not I tread the Path my Kindred went? 1 Judg. Madam! of you the King has greater Care, And by your Tryal, hopes to find you clear. Mar. Though his high Cruelties I must confess, Have justly made the Wifes affection less: Yet my firm Duty never can decrease. Herod. I can no longer holdâ [to Mariam. I'le not believe but you are Guiltless too! No memory of my Banisht rage shall stay, All my suspitions Love has blown away. Mar. Hold Cruel Man! let Justice have its course: My Judges I dislike, but thee much worse; Beyond the bounds of Cruelty they fly, Who torment those, who are about to dy. Herod. Oh you mistake me, for I come to saveâ Mar. Her Life who hates it, and desires a Grave. But what's your right, to give or take my Life, You know you are not King but by your Wife. Herod. Thou try'st by all extremities to move My long-kept Patience, and provoke my Love. To that aloneâand that thou too well know'st The Life thou yet enjoy'st! Proud Queen! thou ow'st. Mar. Nor thy Caresses, nor thy Threats shall move, Thy Threats are yet less hateful than thy Love. Herod. Since you my Love with so much scorn deny, Thou shalt have thy desireâyes, thou shalt dye, To the Judges. Perform that Charge I formerly did give, And if you find her false, let her not live. Let not the Name of Queen, keep you in awe: Nor yet Divert the Justice of the Law. [Exit. Mar. You see your Champion's gon; you may with-draw; I am your Queen, above you, and your Law. [Exit. 2 Judg. She has a Soul no Power on Earth can tame. 1 Judg. We may return as useless as we came. Enter to them Herod and Salom. Salom. But why so weak! what shifting Passions move His Soul? now mad with Rage, now fool'd with Love. Herod. But once again I am my self become, And will an inrag'd Monarchs power assume. Such high and lofty Pride swells her great heart, That 'tis high time that and her head should part. What now? 1 Judg. She treats us Sir with such disdain and scorn, As if she were more than a Princess born. Herod. She's guilty then, who dares not thus be try'd. Salom. I doubt there's somthing in it more than Pride. Herod. O Heav'n! pull down your Thunders on my head, Pluck up those roots of Love, or strike me dead. Salom. Why make you thus your self unfortunate! To rage for her that pays your Love with Hate. Herod. I know she hates me, and I know it well; And yet I can't her Image hence expel. But I will hear no more what Love can say: Yes, yes, Mariamne, thou shalt Dye to day. I'le start not from what I resolve to do, Though whilst I take her Life, I lose mine too. Salom. Sir, you with Passions have so much been sway'd, You never ask'd whether you were Obey'd In your commands last Night: but you will find Somthing in these will satisfie your mind. delivers him the Papers. Herod. 'Tis true I had forgot. [Reads to himself. Salom. See! how it works? Poison I hope in their Confession Lurks! See how he swells! It will burst out anon: He likes not what he Reads, yet must read on. Herod. How! when I was to CÃ¦sar gone, the Queen [reads. Was privately by Tyridates seen! Oh Heavens! Last Night for all the Danger he was in, Return'd and privately met her agen. Disguis'dâaloneâby Nightâah this does prove The strength of his and her unlawful Love. Are these men Dead? hah!â Salom. They have receiv'd a just reward of Treacheryâ Herod. Yes! here's enough to satisfie my mind. Now Justice to my self, and thee, I am kind. For she shall Dye, and like a Traytress too. Do you my Orders instantly pursue. Do it before my fit of Love return.â [Exeunt Judges. If that get in, it will my Rage remove. I must keep this Storm to keep out Love. [Exit. Scene the Third The Prison. Mariamne, Cleophe weeping. Mar. Leave weeping Cleophe, I pray forbear; Is it the mark of sorrow, or of fear? Cleoph. Madam, I doubt your spotless Innocence Against the Tyrant will be small defence! You know he spares no Life when Rage bears sway: And now I fear least it take yours away.â Mar. I prithee neither fear, nor weep for that, 'Tis Death alone can make me fortunate. That will my Soul from Chains of flesh unbind, And give unbounded freedom to my mind. This Soul that's fetter'd here, when I shall dye, To an Eternal Liberty will fly: And what's contracted in this Body now, Shall like a mighty Circle endless grow. How Cleophe, can I your tears approve, Who weep the fate I both desire and love. If thou lov'st me, shew an unclouded eye, I am resolv'd, and am prepar'd to Dy. 'Tis guilt alone disturbs a Soul with fears, And foolish weakness vents it self in Tears!â Enter Pheroras, Guard, Attendants. Pher. Madam, I am sorry that 'tis I must bring So sad a Message from an Angry King. Mar. Speak it Pheroras, and I'le bless that breath, That greets my Ear with the kind sound of Death. Pher. Nothing can your unhappy Fate put by, His resolution's fix'd, that you shall dyeâ And all things do without already wait, Therefore prepare your self for this sad Fate. Mar. Pheroras, call't not sad; I n'er till now Receiv'd a Message half so kind from you. Let Herod know his present I receive As the most pretious thing he had to give. And with my thanks Pheroras let him know This to my memory, and my blood I owe: I n'ere did derogate in all my Life From th'Honour and the Vertue of a Wife. Phero. Oh would the King your Loyalty believ'd, Or were by some kind Angel undeceiv'd! Mar. The blood of Philon and Sohemus shed, Will pull down Vengeance on his guilty head: And if my Death is stain'd by any guilt, 'Tis 'cause imprudently their blood I spilt. For Tyridates, I confess 'tis true, I render'd what was to his Vertue due. Acknowledgments and Innocent esteem, And that was all I ever gave to him. I shall not rack your Patience by delay, However I a little beg your stay. Whilst I retire to banish from my mind, All those Ideas I must leave behind. That my wing'd Soul prepar'd for her high flight, May shake off Life and Crowns to mount more light. [Ex. Mar. &amp; Cleop. Enter Judges and Executioner with an Axe in his hand, dressed with Linnen Sleeves and Apron, and in his other hand a black Cypress Scarf. 1 Judg. All things are ready! where's the Pris'ner gone. Pher. She did desire some time to be alone. 2 Judg. But does her haughty mind continue still? 3 Judg. Death will affright her sure, or nothing will. 2 Judg. But how did she her Sentence Sir, receive? Pher. She seem'd not to Rejoyce, nor yet to Grieve! She heard me speak unmov'd and without fears, When I my self could scarce refrain from tears. She whom Friends Deaths has into Passions thrown, Calmely receives the Knowledge of her own. And as her tongue did from reproach refrain, She shew'd it was below her to complain. She spake! would Herod had himself been by, And unconcern'd, prepar'd her self to dye: Enter Mar. &amp; Clophe. But see she comes; her Eyes no grief betray: She is Tryumphant on her dying-day. Mar. Come Friends, let's go! conduct me to the place, Whence I shall follow all my Noble Race. What means that Cypress Scarfe? Phero. To blind your Eyes, Death will be gentler when it does surprize! Nature will start else in her own defence. The stroke is suffer'd best, whilst in suspence. You must not see the Blow! Mar. Lay that Scarfe by. I am a Queen, and like my self will dye. It is not Death can overcome my heart: Nor at its blackest horrors make me start. No, I'le look thus, thus Fate despis'd I'le meet: 'Tis they smile best, who death thus kindly greet. [Exeunt. Scene Fourth A Chamber. Enter Alexandra. The Pulses of my trembling Soul beat high, Mariamne's dead, or is about to dye. Disturbing fancies aggravate my fears, And Ignorance does but increase my Cares. Such horrid Visions fright me from my rest, My interrupted slumbers they molest. In vain all day her safety I enquire, For none will satisfy my just desire. Minutes seem days, and every hour a year, Whilst I am rack't thus betwixt hope and fear. O Cruel King! with Torments thou dost kill: The fear is always greater then the ill: I once agen to my rough guard will sue; Gold may do more then Tears or Prayers could do. [Exit. Enter Herod (as distracted) and Salome. Salom. What ayles you Sir? Herod. Did not you hear the Musick? see, see, what's there? Salom. Sir I see nothing that should cause this fear. He is distracted sure? Herod. See, see, what sight my Eyes invades; See Aristobulus from the Neather shades! Salom. Sir, I see nothing, 'tis your fancy sure. Herod. Antigonus! See the Queens Brother comes to fright me too. Salom. Look calmer Sir! your fancy is disturb'd! Herod. See Old Hircanus risen from the Dead! See Salome how he looks and shakes his head? See Joseph, Sohemus, Philon! see where they go. They are all risen from the shades below. Salom. Sure it is Madness that disturbs you so! Herod. Oh the Queen, the Queen, the Queen! Oh she is dead! See Salome: stay, Mariamneâstay: she's fled. Salom. Pray Sir settle your disturb'd mind!â Herod. Stay Mariamne! dead, dost fly from me too? No Jealousy nor Rage can reach you now. [Exeunt. Scene sixth Scene Jerusalem. Enter Sosius with Romans. Sosius. The general murmur which assaults my Ear, Speaks the sad Truth of my unhappy fear. I dare not ask, and yet I fain would know, Suspence! alas! does but intangle woe. [Enter Pheroras. Page. Sir, here's Pheroras that can tell you more. Sosius. Tell me Pheroras, may it be believ'd The Queen is dead! I hope I am deceiv'd? Pher. Yes Sir, she's dead, and all that glory's gon, Which with such Lustre in Judea shon. Like a bright Star dropt from the Firmament, She's fallne, and with her all the light she lent. Sosius. O Cruel King! I wish! but 'tis too late! Pher. I need not tell what brought her to this Fate. Sosius. That's too well known; but tell me how she dy'd. Pher. O Sir, the Queen such manly Courage wore, As you or CÃ¦sar could have shown no more. Unmov'd, and without sign of discontent, Unvail'd she to the Fatal Scaffold went. There of us all she kindly took her leave, Some Jewels then to Cleophe she gave: And made the Guard to bear her Weeping thence, Because her pious Tears gave her offence. Whilst she discours'd, our Tears run trickling down, And no Eyes there were Tearless, but her own. Sosius. The highest Vertue's fled that ever shin'd! O Cruel Tyrant! to the World unkind! Pher. O Sir! the King does want your pitty now, I left the Pallace Sir to seek for you. Sosius. What then it seems he does repent too late. Pher. Yes Sir! he now repents what he has done, And calls on Mariamne, now she's gone. The Furies sting his Soul with such remorse, He now his Servants, now, himself does Curse. He threatens Death and a Revenge on all. But yet the storm seems on himself to fall: Just now he's gone, and none did dare withstand Wrath in his Eyes, a Dagger in his hand. Distracted thus, he towards the Prison made, Where her dead body back they have convey'd. 'Tis you alone his Fury can asswage, No other dares oppose his fatal Rage. Sosius. Come! let us go! lest we should come too late: I must avert, though he deserves that Fate. [Exeunt. Scene the Last The Scene opened, Mariamne appears laid on a Couch as Beheaded. Enter Alexandra. Alexan. So much Confusion I meet every where, I have no doubt for my increasing fear. See there's the Cause. Alas! this dismal sight O'rewhelms my sence with horrours dark as Night. Nature's too strong, And keeps my Soul in Prison here too long. But I will give no Rest to my sad mind, Till I a way to Death, or Vengeance find. Tyrant, at thee, my just revenge shall fly; And then contented with my Fate, I'le dye. [Exit. Enter Tyridates and Arsanes. Tyrid. See where she lyes Arsanes! see she's dead! And my enfeebled Soul is with her fled. Here I my grief will forfeit at the Eye, And gazing thus upon this Object, dye. I feel the little blaze of Life decrease, And yet my mind enjoys no kind of Peace. I would have time With my own hands to tear his heart away, Who could such Innocence to Death betray. But ah my Soul is flutt'ring to be gone, And leaves Revenge to the just Gods alone. Arsa. Oh Sir, your Courage should support you now. Tyrid. My Life Arsanes to the Queen is due. Was't not enough, (Oh aggravating thought!) That the Queen dyed, and dyed too by my fault! I caus'd the Cruelties she did sustain; After all this, can I behind remain? No, I would strike a Dagger to my heart, Had not my kinder grief perform'd that part: My juster sorrow sudden death affords, Without the help of Poyson, Wound, or Swords: Arsanes help, remains of Life are small: At my ador'd Queens feet direct my fall. Arsan. Shall grief thus overcome? Tyrid. O yes, I find Deaths kind embraces all my sences bind. The world turns round, and by degrees I gain A kind of Resurrection from my pain. Farewell my kind Arsanes. Arsan. Oh Sir stay. Tyrid. Accept dead Queen, this Homage which I pay. At my approach be not offended now, The strictest Vertue may this grace allow: Thy Vow to Herod's Cancel'd here, and I Now gain that Bliss you did in Life deny, And we may now come nearer when we dye. Enter Herod with a Dagger in his hand. Herod. Where is the Queen! Oh she is dead; she's deadâ Thou lyestâit can't beâyet from me she's fled. See there she lyes, Murder'd by my Command; Here I alive, her Bloody Husband stand. Tyrid. Thanks my kind heart! my blood new Vitals takes; Rows'd by that form my drooping Spirit wakes. [draws. Herod. Ha! Tyridates! [draws. Tyrid. Tyrant, art thou here? Herod. Usurper, how darest thou invade this place? If Life thou lovest, take hence thy hated face. So great a Passion none but she e're gave: I'm Jealous of that Beauty in her Grave. Tyrid. Monster, when by my hand thy blood is spilt, To meet Damnation equal to thy Guilt; At that blest minute thy black Soul shall flye, May Heaven but hate thee half so much as I. Herod. Have at thy heart, thy fury I defy. Two fiercer Foes, Fate on one Stage can't bring; A desp'rate Lover, and a Rival King. [They make a full Pass, and both fall; Tyridates at Mariamnes feet. Tyrid. Revenge, thou'st done thy part, now Love go on; And finish what Mariamnes Eyes begun. Though it grows dark, my Ghost shall rove about, And never stop till it has found thine out. To do thee Homage, when in Heaven we meet, There as on Earth I'le fall before thy feet. [dyes, Herod. Ha! into what Confusion am I hurl'd, Hee'l be my Rival in the other World. If Souls can fight, I thee to Battle dare, And mine shall hence only to meet thine there. As my blood cooles, my frighted sence looks home On my past deeds, and what I have to come. Here stand my Crimes, and there Eternity; Men take the largest prospect when they dye. Just Souls may mount, but mine I fear descends, There Love, there Jealousy, here Tyrant ends. [Dyes. Arsa. A Roman Courage in my breast I find, And a disdainful scorn to stay behind: But I must live in kindness to thy name, And keep my hated life to speak thy same. [Exit. Enter Salome. Salom. All dead! and all my Trophyes! work for Graves! Ruine and Death, ye are obedient Slaves, Stars boast no more, the rule of humane fate, No threatening Planet like a Womans hate. I fround, and Ruine darted from my Eyes, Doom'd by my hate, this blasted greatness dyes. If Kings are next to Gods, what then are they, Who at their feet such mighty Victimes lay! Oh Jealousy! Oh Glorious Woman-kind! But thy chief Conquest Salome is behind. I know I for their deaths accus'd shall be; And the dull Gown must of my head decree. I scorn to such mean Judges to discend: No, I began with this, with this I'le endâ [draws her Dagger. They the best Courage show, who with a frown Give others death, and smiling give their ownâ [Stabs her self. Enter Sosius, Pheroras, Arsanes, and Attendants. Ha! must my death admit of Lookers on! Dull Life make hast, &amp; tardy Soul be gone. Tares open her Bosom and stabs agen. So, now 'tis doneâ [falls. Death ends both scorn and pride: And I may dye by Tyridates side. Though love once made me fire, Fate sets me free, And in the Grave makes me as cold as theeâ [dyes. Sosius. Come let us from this dismal place be gon, Where Cruelty and Love so much have done. Pheroras. Love, Jealousy, and Spight, conspir'd thy fall: But thou, great Queen, hast over-come them all. Faire Innocence, how e're supprest, will rise; And Vertue, though she suffers, never dyes. Exeunt Omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mariamne. I who by Herod's Jealous Wrath was Slain, Can by your Kindness be Reviv'd again. I, who Undaunted dyed, now Trembling come, Fearing your Breath, more than a Tyrants Doom. If you but smile, let him still rage, and frown: Your Friendship's valued more than Herod's Crown. But if I cannot so much favour win, Come but to Morrow, and I'le dye agen. FINIS.</field>
