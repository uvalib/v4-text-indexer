But this as I dyd say I must do in the night, for I dare not do yt in the day because I feare my fathers house &amp; the men of the citty who worshippers are of Baal, &amp; much inclined to Idolatry where fore about this busines I will go &amp; gett yt done now while the night ys darke: so shall we bee hindred of none Marco Come fellow cittizens let's go &amp; adore early this morninge our great god Baal so shall we haue better successe in ech thinge we take in hand all the day after. Alas what's this I see The groue's cutt downe, Baals Altar's spoyl'd, &amp; all turnd topsy toruy. Rullus And worse then that I here espy an other Altar builded &amp; on yt there's a holocaust layd. Who hath vs thus abused? Tripho I'l go &amp; make inquiry for the Author of this deede Marco. So do: but quickly come agayne. for sorrow my heart doth bleede Tripho Neighbours I credibly am inform'd that this foule act was done by Gedeon Ioas sonne. Rull[us]. By whom? Gedeon our neighbours sonne? Ioas thy sonne fetch forth that he may dy: for so he shall because he hath cutt downe the groue, &amp; spoyld th'Altar of Baal. Ioas will you reuenge Baals quarell, &amp; for hym fight? Let that man dy before to morrow light apparent be, that ys his aduersary. yf Baal be god, reuenge hym self on hym that rays'd his Altar Marco Let his name be Ieroboall for euer more here after because Ioas did say: Reuenge hym self on hym that raysed his Altar. But syth Gedeon ys the man that vs thus serued all Madian let's go call together, &amp; Amalec &amp; th'East people wt h out delay, &amp; our selues in the vayle in campe of Iezraell God Gedeon take courage for wt h my spirit I haue the reuested Gedeon Lord yf thou wilt by my hand saue Israel as thou hast promised I will this fleece of woole lay on the flore, &amp; yf there bee dew found on the fleece only, &amp; all the ground els be drye I shall know that by my hand thou wilt Israel deliuer so for a tyme I'l hence go, &amp; then backe agayne come hither. I see the ground ys dry, I will go wringe the fleece of woole to try yf yt be wett: Lo yt hath fild a vessell full of dew: Let not thy fury lord wt h me offended bee yf seekeinge a signe in the fleece I once agayne do tempt thee. Let the ground now be wett wt h dew, &amp; the fleece only dry that I may know whether Israell shall by me deliuered bee. Behold the ground ys wett, &amp; the fleece dry: I see right well that thou my lord &amp; god by my hand wilt deliuer Israell. wherefore I'l go forth wt h &amp; call my souldiers all together that I may take a view both of their persons &amp; their number. my men now mustered are, &amp; they are two &amp; thirty thousand God Gedeon thy men are many, &amp; therefore madian to their hand shall not be geuen vp lest Israel should agaynst me glory &amp; say by our owne force from madian we deliuered bee. Wherefore in hearinge of them all go &amp; make proclamation that such as fearefull bee &amp; timorous may back agayne be gone Gedeon. Lord I'l be gone &amp; to them say as thou dost me command Twenty two thousand are return'd, &amp; there stay but ten thousand God Gedeon the multitud's yet great: go lead them to the waters &amp; such as water lapp lyke dogs continue them still for souldiers The rest that kneelinge drynke lyke men, let them dismissed bee Gedeon Lord I'l be gone forth wt h agayne &amp; do as thou hast bidden mee Those Lord that water lapt lyke dogs are but only three hundred God In those three hundred men you shall from madian be deliuered by mee: Let all the rest returne agayne into their place Gedeon wt h that three hundred lord then I'l march on euen as thou sayes God Gedeon aryse. Ged[eon]. Here lord. God. Now downe to madian streight be gone whyle yt's yet night, for to thee yt's deliuer'd. But yf alone thou be afrayd to go, Let thy seruant phara go wt h thee. And when that thou shalt heare them speake, thy hand shall strengthned bee &amp; thou shalt better courage haue to sett vpon thyne enemyes who now doth scattered lye below the hill downe in the valleys Gedeon. Vpon thy word lord I'l be gone wt h phara only wt h mee to Madians campe, &amp; listen what they say this same night secretly. Now are we come to the part of the campe where the watch lyeth: Harke one ys talkeinge to an other: Let's marke the tale he telleth Sulcus Neighbour I had a dreame, &amp; there in methought I did see rowlinge to madians campe as yt were a harth loafe of barly &amp; when yt to the tabernacle came yt threwe yt downe flatt to the earth. what thinke you there of ys th'interpretation? Bembo. No other thinge at all but Gedeons sword there by ys signifyed: for the Lord hath Madian, &amp; all their campe to hym deliuered Gedeon This dreame wt h yt interpretation doth geue me good content gods name be prays'd. Now let's be gone to Israels campe incontinent: Israell aryse, for our lord hath madian to vs deliuered. Now haue I (as you know) my host into three parts diuided: &amp; both you &amp; the rest shall empty pitchers wt h you cary &amp; lamps &amp; trumpets in your hands, &amp; I your guyde will bee. An do you as I do: &amp; when you heare my Trumpet sound, sound also yours, &amp; crye about the campe to gether round: To our lord &amp; to Gedeon: &amp; where the watch ys we'l begin to enter first: &amp; so soone as you shall be all wt h in into three seuerall places go, &amp; as you there stand round about the campe, your pitchers clapp, &amp; Trumpetts sound that in your right hands are, when that your pitchers broken bee. &amp; then houldinge your lampes in your lefte hands, together cry The sword of our lord &amp; of Gedeon, &amp; what will there of follow referre to god, who promysed hath the victory vnto you. Israelits The sword of our Lord &amp; of Gedeon: To our Lord &amp; to Gedeon Madian Alas for wo, what shall we do? we shall be slayne ech one Israelits The sword of our lord &amp; of Gedeon: To our Lord &amp; to Gedeon Gedeon Lo they haue murdred one an other: &amp; some are fledd &amp; gone: lets them pursew wt h shouts &amp; cryes: to our Lord &amp; to Gedeon The sword of our lord &amp; of Gedeon: to our lord &amp; to Gedeon chorus Gedeon pursewed hath his foes beyond the Riuer Iordane &amp; there of Madian are a hundred twenty thousand slayne &amp; fiftene thousand did escape but since haue bene surprised on the east syde of Nobe, when that they no mischaunce suspected Amongst whom were two kings of madian. They also ouerthrew the men of Soccoth, &amp; th'Ancients there of in peeces drew wt h thornes because they would not them releeue, when they pursewed the madionittes: And phanuels Tower for the same cause they ruyned Since wc h tyme madian neuer could their neckes lift vp agayne so that Israel for fourty yeares in quietnes did remayne till Gedeons death: But then they fell agayne vnto Idolatry &amp; wt h Baal they a couenant made that he their god should bee forgettinge quite how our lord had them from their foes deliuered &amp; Ierobaals sonne Abimalech, whom he by a concubin had did of his mothers brethren (who in sichem dwelt) craue ayd &amp; they gaue hym a mighty masse of money, where wt h he hyred a company of needy men, &amp; vacabonds, who hym followed &amp; to his fathers house he went &amp; murdred all his brethren Ierobaals sonnes vpon one stone, in number seuenty men only Ioatham the yongst by hydinge of hym self escaped &amp; afterward the men of sichem Abimalech kinge created: wc h when Ioatham had heard he sayd vnto the men of Sichem yf you haue dealt well wt h me &amp; the rest of Gedeons children then in Abimalech reioyce this day, &amp; hee in you but yf iniustly you haue dealt wt h vs, let fyre issue from hym &amp; th'inhabitants consume of Sichem &amp; of Mello &amp; from them both for to consume Abimalech let fyre go. wc h thinges when he had to them sayd he lefte them there to gether &amp; into Bera fledde for feare of Abimalech his Brother. But god remorse of conscience to the Sichemits suggested in so much that they shortly after Abimalech detested for murderinge of Ierobaal Gedeons sonnes: &amp; Gaal the sonne of Obed did conspyre his ouerthrow: yet in conclusion Abimalech Mello their confederats &amp; citty wholly waysted &amp; on them to reuenge hym self the more, salt in yt sowed. wc h done he went to Thebes &amp; yt besieged wt h his Army &amp; there in was a Tower to wc h th'inhabitants fledd for safty vnder wc h when Abimelech came, There was aboue a woman who hurlinge a peece of a mylstone downe did breake his brayne but beinge not kild out right, hee forthwt h cald to hym his squyre &amp; that he would draw out his sword &amp; kill hym, did desyre lest yt perhaps be sayd (quoth he) I was slayne by a woman So god repayd Abimalechs yll wc h he before had done As Sichemitts also both wt h death, &amp; the losse of their towne &amp; so the curse of Ioatham Gedeons sonne vpon them fell when that Abimalech had three yeares bene ruler ouer Israell. &amp; Thola hym succed'd, who three &amp; twenty yeares did sitt as Iudge: &amp; next to hym twenty two yeare sate Iair the Galaadite after whose death the Israelits agayne fell to Idolatry for wc h into the philisthijmes hands they now committed bee by whom they are oppressed sore, &amp; eightene yeares haue beene as well they haue deseru'd by reason of their heynous synne And how longe they shall thus afflicted be as yet's not knowne but you shall vnderstand in tyme. So hence I will be gone.</field>
