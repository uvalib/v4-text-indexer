      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. I publish this tragedy not without many apprehensions. The various pieces which I have known applauded on the stage, and despised in the closet, make me dread lest mine should incur the same fate. One or two striking incidents, the skill of the actors, my readiness to obviate objections, might conciliate an audience in the representation; but a different merit is necessary to support the broad day of publication. The regular conduct of the piece, or even its interesting the passions, will then be of little consequence. Every work in verse, though otherwise complete, must of necessity be tedious, if each line is not full of strength and harmony; if an elegance pervades not the whole; if it wants those inexpressible graces of poetry which genius alone can bestow, to which knowledge can never attain, and concerning which we have argued so poorly, and to so little purpose since the death of Mr. Despreaux. It is a very great mistake to imagine, that the versification is either the easiest, or the least considerable part of a dramatic performance. Racine, who of all men, Virgil excepted, best knew the art of verse, was of a different opinion. He spent two whole years in composing his PhÃ¦dra. Pradon boasts that his was finished in less than two months. As the transient success of a tragedy, depends with respect to its representation, not on the style, but on the actors and incidents, the two PhÃ¦dras seemed at first to meet with an equal degree of applause. But the merits of each were soon determined on their publication. Pradon, according to the usual practice of bad authors, in an insolent preface accused his critics of prejudice and malice; this, however, availed but little; his play so much extolled by his party and himself, sunk into that contempt which it deserved; and were it not for the PhÅdra of Mr. Racine, we should not know at present, that Pradon ever composed one. But whence arises the vast difference between these two performances? The plot is nearly the same in both. Theseus is absent in the first acts: he is supposed to have been in the infernal regions with Pirithous. Hippolytus his son wants to quit Trezene, and fly from Aricia whom he loves. He declares his passion to Aricia, and attends to that of PhÃ¦dra with horror. He dies the same kind of death, and his governor relates the circumstances of it. Add to this, that the personages in each piece, being in the same situation, say almost the same things; but here it is, that the man of genius, and the bad poet are distinguished. When Racine and Pradon have similar sentiments, the contrast is most striking between them. As a remarkable proof of this, we need only take the speech of Hippolytus when he first discovers his love to Aricia. In Racine he expresses himself as follows: âI who so long with proud rebellion strove âAgainst the force of love, and mock'd his chains; âWho saw with pity the disastrous wreck âOf feeble mortals, thinking I should stand âAlways secure, and from the shore survey âThe raging billows. To the common law âNow subject; ah! how fatal is the change! âWhat restless tumults hurry me away âFar from myself! one moment hath subdu'd âMy rash presumption, and this haughty soul âIt's freedom boasts no more. Six lingering months âTortured with shame, a prey to hopeless grief, âI bore the rankling arrow in my breast. âAgainst thy charms, against my own desires âI struggled, but in vain. I shunn'd thy sight; âBut thou wert present still; thy image pierced âThe forest's deep recess; the beams of day, âThe shades of darkness brought before my view âThy winning form in new-born grace array'd; âAll, all conspire to bend to thy controul âThis heart reluctant: to my former self âNow lost, the only meed of all my toil. âMy bow, my javelin, and swift-rolling car âDelight no more, no longer I regard âThe precepts of the Ocean-God; the woods âEcho my groans alone, and unemploy'd âMy coursers have forgot their master's voice.â Pradon makes Hippolytus speak thus: âToo long with impious lips have I reproach'd âLove's gentler passion, and adored Diana; âIn solitary fierceness spent my life âChasing the bears and lions of the desart. âNow a pursuit more urgent claims my care, âAnd my distracted thoughts employs. Thy charms âWhen I beheld, the field and all it's sports âI strait forsook; erst sought with sweet delight. âAnd now no other motive, to the chace âImpels my steps, but to reflect on thee.â These two passages cannot be read and compared, without our admiring the one, and laughing at the other. There is, however, in both the same ground of sensations and thoughts; for when we are to make the passions speak, all men have nearly the same ideas. But the manner of expressing them distinguishes the man of wit, from him who has none, the man of genius from him who has only wit, and the poet from him who would be a poet if he could. To arrive at Racine's perfection in writing, a man must possess his genius, and polish his works like him. How different ought I to be, who born with such indifferent talents, and oppressed by continual disorders, have neither the gift of a fine imagination, nor leisure to correct the faults of my compositions with diligent attention? I perceive and lament all the imperfections, both in the contexture and diction of this piece. I should have altered some of them for the better, could I have delayed the publication; but a great many would still have remained. In every art there is a certain point beyond which we can never advance. We are confined within the limits of our talents; we see perfection before us, and make impotent efforts to attain to it. I shall not critically examine all the particular faults of this piece; the reader will find abundant room for such remarks without any assistance. But I cannot help taking notice of a general objection which has been made to the choice of my subject. As it is the genius of Frenchmen to lay hold with rapidity on what is ridiculous, in things of the most serious nature; it has been said that the subject of Mariamne is nothing more, than an old, amorous, brutal husband, to whom his wife, from aversion, refuses the conjugal duty. To which it has been added, that a family quarrel could never make the foundation of a good tragedy. I would beg the attention of the reader to a few reflections on prejudices of this kind. Tragedies are either founded on the interest of a whole nation, or on the private interests of particular princes. Of the first kind are, the Iphigenia in Aulis, where all Greece assembled demands the blood of the daughter of Agamemnon: the Horatii, where the fate of Rome is intrusted to three combatants: and OEdipus, in which the safety of the Thebans depends on the discovery of the murderer of Laius. Of the second kind are Britannicus, PhÃ¦dra, Mithridates, &amp;c. In the three latter pieces, all the interest is confined to the families of their respective heroes. Every event is produced by passions which the vulgar feel in the same manner as princes; and their plots are as proper for comedy as tragedy. Take the names away, and Mithridates is only an old fellow in love with a young girl; his two sons are in love with her likewise; and he has recourse to a very mean stratagem to discover which of the two she is fond of. PhÅdra is a step-mother who encouraged by an intriguing confidante, makes proposals to her son-in-law, who is elsewhere engaged. Nero is an impetuous young man, who falls suddenly in love, wants immediately to be parted from his wife, and hides himself behind the tapestry to overhear the conversation of his mistress. These are subjects as fit for the pen of Moliere, as of Racine. The plot indeed of the Miser is precisely the same with that of Mithridates. Harpagon and the King of Pontus are two old men in love, each of them has a rival in his son, and each of them has recourse to the same artifice to discover what passes between the son and the mistress; and each piece conclude with the marriage of the young man. Moliere and Racine were equally successful. One amused, and excited the mirth and laughter of the audience. The other affected, terrified, and made them weep. Moliere exposed the ridiculous love of an old miser; Racine represented the weakness of a great prince, and rendered it respectable. Should Vateau and Le Brun be ordered to paint a wedding. One would exhibit a company of peasants under an arbour in all their native, rude, and lawless jollity, seated round a rustic table, where drunkenness, riot, debauchery, and immoderate laughter would prevail. The other wound paint the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, the feast of the Gods, and their sublime enjoyments. Thus both, though by different means, would arrive at the highest degree of perfection in their art. All these examples may be applied to Mariamne. The ill humour of a wife, the love of an old husband, the malicious tricks of a sister-in-law, are subjects of a lighter kind, and in themselves of a comic nature. But a monarch to whom the world has given the title of great, fond to distraction of the finest woman in the universe, the violent transports of a king so famous for his virtues and his crimes; his past cruelties, his present remorse; that perpetual and rapid transition from love to hatred; the ambition of his sister, the intrigues of his ministers, the distressful situation of a princess, whose virtue and beauty are celebrated even to this day, who had seen her father and brother condemned to death by her husband, and who to complete her misfortunes was beloved by the murderer of her family; what a field is here! what an opening for any genius but mine! will any one affirm that such a subject is unworthy of tragedy? It rather proves, most evidently, that as things happen to turn out, so they change their names.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SALOME, MAZAEL. MAZAEL. Yes, the supreme authority with which Herod invested thee, is now at least, Confirm'd till his return. I flew t'ward Azor, And suddenly repass'd Samaria's plains To Jordan's source. In lucky hour I came The factious Hebrews to confound, and dash Their towering hopes; thy brother long detain'd In Rome, throughout th'extent of his domains Was almost lost to memory: and the people Forever full of treachery to their kings, Bold in their words, blind in their wild caprice, Publish'd aloud that Herod was condemn'd By Rome, and wore the shackles of a slave. That in the rank of her great ancestors The queen was fix'd, by whom again restor'd The blood of our high-priests should o'er us reign. I own it with regret, where e'er I moved I saw that Mariamne was the object Of holy reverence, and her name the theme Of dearest estimation. Israel still Loves with idolatry th'heroic race From whence she sprang. Her charms, her birth, and more Her sad misfortunes, have seduced the hearts Of Judah's sons who look on us with hatred. And while invoking heaven, to her they gave The sovereign title, their enthusiast zeal Seem'd to denounce thy certain fall. I saw How all the people by these false reports Were moved, and ripe for tumult; but I spake And fear succeeded; to their eyes I painted Herod returning cloath'd with double power, Entering his realms with vengeance close behind Attendant on his steps; his name alone Hath scatter'd terror thro' the land; and now The Jews in silence mourn their errors past. SALOME. Mazael, undoubtedly we soon shall view The king's approach; the people and myself Shall own a master; this imperial sway Which I can scarce be said to have enjoy'd, Is but a shade whose evanescent form In passing, disappears. I love my brother; Yet his good fortune sinks me to the earth, And Mariamne's triumph is my bane. MAZAEL. Fear not thy brother. SALOME. Ah! what depth of woe Shall be our lot, when the queen sees again Her husband at her feet? This haughty rival Of my authority, with voice seductive Tainting the regal ear, hath ever been Pernicious to our hopes. Her daring soul, Proud and unyielding, cherishes t'ward us Eternal hate; on us will fall her vengeance. Mazael, I have offended her too much To be forgiven. Self-interest will inspire The means of our abasement. Hah! what say'st thou! Dost thou no longer those all-powerful charms Contemplate with dismay, which tyrannize Imperious o'er the heart of wretched Herod? E'er since the fatal nuptials which in one Their destinies combined, a space almost Of five revolving years, that wondrous love Which, as with fascination, struck his soul, By hate is fed, and strengthened by disdain. Oft hast thou seen this monarch, whom no tears Or prayers could bend, cast majesty's dread state Aside for her, and lowly at her feet Strive in her eyes, averted now with scorn, And now indignant glances darting on him, With fondest assiduity, to read Those tender looks, which he could never find. Oft hast thou seen him storm, and sigh, and mourn, Flatter, incense, menace, and shrink before her. Fierce in his love, submissive in his rage, A slave at home; abroad a glorious hero. Nay more; when giving loose to just revenge On an ungrateful race, with the sire's blood His hand yet reeking, he adored the daughter. And the uplifted sword, still dyed with gore, Pointed at her, and urged by thee to strike, Fell harmless at her feet. MAZAEL. But think in Rome Far from her sight removed, the chain stretch'd out To such a distance, may be broke in twain. SALOME. Believe me, his return will close the links; And danger ever hide itself beneath Her charms insidious. MAZAEL. True, but her proud soul It's own tormentor, hath unceasing strove To gain the fix'd aversion of her husband. By new disdain she will excite his rage, And place herself the shaft within thy hand Which now eludes it's grasp. No harmony Can e'er exist 'twixt those, whom heaven hath form'd In mutual opposition. Herod always Gloomy, morose, and jealous, will require Even against his love, his sister's aid. SALOME. When Mariamne strait her sway resumes, And I am lost. MAZAEL. Thee Ascalon expects, To ornament it's throne, while a retreat Glorious to thee, a new and splendid court, And hymeneals which by love's own hand Have been prepared, will shelter thee at once From all those storms which Solyma e'erlong May view, perhaps, burst forth with hideous ruin Upon our heads. In Ascalon Sohemus With firm and undisputed title reigns; Acknowledged and protected by the Romans; Free, and uncircumscribed by Herod's power, Dear to his people. In his breast are join'd The sage's wisdom, and the prince's greatness. Nought but success thy future days attends, Herod's supreme directress, or a queen. SALOME. Ah! let thy faithful ear my sufferings learn, And that disgrace which stains my cheeks with shame. For ever Mariamne was decreed My life t'invenom. She of rank, of power, Of dignity deprives me, and for her Sohemus now betrays me. MAZAEL. Hah? what, he! Who hath so long for these espousals waited The king's return! whose rigid sentiments, And philosophic lore austere, appeared To scorn the amorous passion and it's follies, Vain phantoms of the sons of vanity Our empty courtiers! would he thus affront A monarch, his ally! SALOME. What wouldst thou say, Should I inform thee, that the queen and he In secret understand each other well? MAZAEL. I know they are united by the ties Of blood and friendship; but I ne'er beheldâ SALOME. No; thou hast not my eyes; with utmost clearness My new misfortune stands reveal'd before them. The nuptials are a treacherous pretext only, Their pomp delay'd, th'indifference of Sohemus, His language frozen and reserv'd, explain My ignominious lot, and through my soul Dart strongest confirmation. MAZAEL. Dost thou then Suspect, that one of manners so severe, Whose streaming eyes incessantly lament Her father and her brother doom'd to death, Whose high-toned spirit (which augments her woes) Feeds on resentment, and by torture lives, Would indiscreetly seek the fatal triumph, A suitor to withdraw, who wears thy chains? Say can her pride-swol'n bosom stoop to love? SALOME. She can at least inspire it; there's the sting. MAZAEL. Beware of self-delusion. To a soul So arrogant th'excess of scorn hath given What bears the semblance and the shape of virtue; And in her haughtiness she hath resolved To pass her life unsullied. SALOME. On a rock That vaunted haughtiness perchance may split. But what heed I, whether her soaring mind My perjured lover's faithless bosom charms? Or whether proving her disdainful power, Unwillingly she gives me poignant anguish? Whether she cherishes or not the treasure From me purloin'd, it is no longer mine; That thought suffices; thence her pride gains wings; My shame exalts her glory; she enjoys With an insulting smile the pangs I feel, And all the tears I shed. And shall I long This base constraint endure, and pine in secret? No; full conviction shall instruct me soon How far they claim revenge.âSohemus comes; Leave me. My fate will now unfold itself. SCENE II. SALOME, SOHEMUS, AMMON. SALOME. Draw near; thy heart was not for treachery form'd, Nor mine to suffer injuries. The king At length returns, and no excuse avails. Yet think not I would wish thee to consult Aught but thy own advantage, hide not then From me thy inmost thoughts; but freely speak. I dread not that inconstancy to hear Plainly avow'd, whose light and weak offence I shall despise; it is not mine to stoop To the low rage of jealousy, or blush At an affront, the shame of which is thine. SOHEMUS. Attend then while my conduct I explain, So shalt thou learn what thy exalted soul Dreads not to hear. The king hath wrong'd me much, This I avow; he coveted o'er me To stretch the power, with which indulged by CÃ¦sar He lorded it in Palestine. His sister Was but the lure by which he meant my ruin, And arrogantly hoped to number me Amid his vassals. My invaded rights I then supported, and against his will Retain establish'd. I too found like him Friends near Augustus, Herod's vengeful threats Appal not me, for justice sways the world. Nor can I bear, (with freedom will I speak) Th'alliance of a king, for whom my mind Fosters resentment. Add to this the storms Which well thou know'st infest his court. In all Whom he beholds, he dreads approaching treason, And thro' a thousand open avenues Suspicions enter and alarm his soul, He doom'd to death the brother of the queen, Outrage on outrage follow'd. Mariamne In these drear mansions spends her life between Fell cruelty, and fierce impetuous love. Now the drawn dagger pointed at her heart, Now worshipp'd to idolatry; with tears Bathing for ever a detested bed, In terror from her husband, or the crew Of vile accusers, who with flattery base Still hover round their miserable king. SALOME. When she's the theme, words flow, me thinks, with ease. SOHEMUS. Know'st thou not, princess, that her blood and mine Spring from a kindred source? and what concern I take in all her fortunes? SALOME. Well I know it. SOHEMUS. Yet more; her fate hath long engaged my fears, But now they all are past. Herod will cherish Her mother's feeble and declining age; A solemn promise he at least hath given To th'emperor his master. As for me, Far from a court which I detest, for ever I fly from Solyma, it's prince, and thee. Yes, I depart; but think not a new chain Succeeding thine, draws on my steps; at once The king, his realm, and each connecting tie Do I renounce, but chiefly that of love. Reproach not my sincerity of mind; What I forbear to others, 'tis but just That I receive not. SALOME. Know, my soul disdains The angry taunt, or petulance of spleen. I am not ignorant of more, much more Than thou hast utter'd. True, no doubt this court Is not unstain'd by guilt; there are, whose souls Of noblest stamp have been impell'd to deeds In some ill-fortuned period, which their virtue Amply atones, and which command respect. There are of lower sphere, whose slavish weakness Most arrogantly claims the name of wisdom, Who underneath it's specious gewgaw dress Hide their soft silken bonds. Perhaps I speak not To an unconscious ear. In vain thy art Would strive from me the rival to conceal For whom I am betray'd. I know it allâ And whom thou hast seduced. No dupe am I To hypocritic virtue, nor is mine A heart which thy inconstancy can wound. But if thou turn'st thy eyes aside from storms, Which shook this palace, now so much detested, Dread to excite that which may haply reach Far as the petty state which calls thee lord. [Exit. SCENE III. SOHEMUS, AMMON. SOHEMUS. What do her words import? What mystic meaning? Why think she can espy within my heart Thoughts to myself unknown? Hah! that I breathe The amorous sigh! and nurse for Mariamne Instead of friendship's purity severe, A flame unhallow'd! that I yield myself A slave to the soft passion, tho' prepared In haste to quit such numberless perfections! AMMON. From Salome's offended soul the worst Is to be fear'd, the tinge of jealousy Is clearly seen; love hath betray'd itself. SOHEMUS. No; in my breast the devious sentiments Of criminal affection ne'er could enter. The sect I follow, other manners forms. Th'Essenians, rigid stoics of JudÃ¦a, From the pure fountain of morality More noble thoughts derive. Our lords, the Romans! Victors of nations, rule the subject earth, And we our passions. Kindred ties alone Unite Sohemus, and the wife of Herod. Thank heaven, I feel no conscious blushes rise. Harrass'd beneath a dreadful power, I saw Her deep distress; I only wish'd to serve her; And have perform'd my duty. AMMON. It suited well thy just heroic mind T'avenge the virtue trampled on by them. But could'st thou in this court replete with crimes From generous pity act, and not from love! SOHEMUS. Ah! is it needful then that her defence From love should spring? Who would not with myself Such innocence with tender care have shielded? What savage heart would not with speed have flown To her relief? and who to save her life Would not have prodigally risqued his own? O! Friend, this soul no sordid baseness knows, And thou it's zeal canst witness; here I came, Here dwelt, each threatening blow to ward from her; That was my only motive. When from hence The king departed, dubious of his fate, Whether his death would be adjudged by Rome, Or in his hands the sceptre placed again, Urged by excess of love, and jealous frenzy, Dreading, lest slain himself, his hapless queen, For empire born, but then a Roman slave, To some unworthy partner should be doom'd: He gave command a tomb to rear, in which He, and the object of his adoration Might both together be inhumed. Pheroras Had the dire charge assign'd, to offer up To the infernal fires of jealousy The bleeding victim. He to me reveal'd The savage mandate of the guilty king. Thus o'er a life so dear, so full of woe, I with unceasing providence have watch'd, Still arm'd, still prompt and eager to protect her. But chiefly from her eyes intent to hide The face of danger, have contrived to serve her. And not awaken terror. Her misfortunes Have pierced me more than all her matchless beauties. Strongly affected is my heart, but love Has no dominion there, he boasts no conquest, But is by me subdued. The noble passion, Th'exalted sentiments which she inspired, Taught me t'avenge, but not seduce her virtue. In short, success attends the king, Rome yields, The sceptre of JudÃ¦a is restored. Triumphant he returns again to tread This bloody stage, with winged haste he comes To the loved idol of his soul, whom oft He tortures, always goddess-like adores. Their mutual woes are ended; thro' the gloom This horrid court involving, breaks a new And placid morn. My presence may be spared; For Mariamne will at length be happy. I shall no more behold her; but my heart, My melancholy heart to other charms Will be for ever closed; and every bond Of wedlock I with dread and hate survey. Conscious of her perfections, who but looks On all the rest of womankind with scorn? Yes, my retreat, tho' humble, hath for me Sufficient splendor, there shall I reside With virtue bless'd, far from the eyes of tyrants: My lot superior to the proudest kings, Lord of my fate, and master o'er myself. SCENE IV. SOHEMUS, ELISA, AMMON. ELISA. The mother of the queen, Sohemus, doom'd A prey to grief, by all her countless tears Conjures thee to attend, and calm the terrors, Which for her daughter now afresh invade Her wounded soul. SOHEMUS. What horror at thy words Strikes each astonish'd sense! ELISA. Alas! she knows The dreadful mandate of the jealous king; By Salome's inhuman care inform'd. SOHEMUS. Thus our malicious foe mid troubles bred, Fancies by new-raised discord still to hold Her much-loved borrowed power. O hateful court! What various arts are thine! the foot which treads These dire abodes as on the edge abrupt Of dangerous precipices walks. Alas! Strange and unequall'd murther from the eyes Of Alexander erst her husband tore And darling son. Her daughter still remains; She shudders now for her. Maternal love May well be suffer'd to indulge in fear. Eliza go; I follow thee with speed. Great God! who rul'st o'er this disastrous clime! Avert this gathering storm from Mariamne! Preserve, protect the noblest of thy works! The END of the FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SALOME, MAZAEL. MAZAEL. This recent blow urged home, this mystery Of dreadful import, which by thy contrivance To Mariamne and her mother's ear Hath been convey'd; this secret now disclosed, Th'inhuman mandate, will their union break, Seal the divorce, and render it eternal. Herod will ne'er concieve thou could'st betray His confidence to thy inveterate foe. And in the restless tumults of his soul Will seek no friend but thee to lenify Thy own inflicted wounds. To rouse the storm, Or calm it's fury will be thine alone; Divide, and rise to empire; this thy lot. SALOME. Ah! what, it's scope of action circumscribed, Can policy avail! my deep-laid schemes All frustrate, have betray'd me to my ruin; Each deed is now the offspring of despair. A fatal letter from the king demands That at the feet of her imperious rival His sister should with low prostration fall. I thought Sohemus would have lent his firm And generous aid; my influence, Herod own'd. Now am I desolate alas! and stripp'd Of every succour. O'er my luckless head Totters the building which with utmost skill These hands had rear'd. I see there is a time When fortune ruling tramples in the dust Each human effort; every toil is vain; When prudence on destructive rocks is lost, And art but wounds itself; yes, I perceive, I feel the power invincible, supreme, Which in our neighbouring climates at it's will, Sports with their fands, unstable as our fates. MAZAEL. Obey thy brother; to the tempest yield, Stand not erect and brave it's passing rage; Time may recover all! SALOME. Vain consolation! O wretch! who from the tardy step of time Expects his happiness! wouldst thou that I Should trust futurity's deceitful hour, Seeing the injuries thus heap'd upon me? MAZAEL. At least Sohemus to his realm returns, Justly gainst him incens'd, thou needst no more Fear Mariamne; jealousy may rest. SALOME. Her conduct, I confess, mysterious still, Eludes my penetration. But will he Less treacherous prove? less criminal? Am I Insulted less? diminish'd are my foes? Or they who look on me with hidden envy? Or base unmanly friends? noâI must strive With my approaching fall, the secret insult, And public hate. E'en now before the smiles Of Mariamne, prone in adoration, The frantic people their triumphant taunts Prepare for my disgrace. I see all bend To her new power, and droop beneath its blaze, While my week fading honours are eclipsed. But that my soul should sicken at her glory, That I should pine in anguish and despair, Will this suffice? no, soon the stroke of death My ignominious lot, and her renown Will glaringly demonstrate. I cast off All flattery here, nor foster it's delusions. So circumstanced, myself would dash the front Of every foe, and tread the aspiring down. She cannot reign, unless by my destruction; Nor can her just resentment want to learn That I'm too dangerous to be spared. Mean while O dire constraint! O load of infamy! My high exalted soul stoop to her. I come to soothe her pride with my respect, And on my own misfortunes and my shame Utter congratulations. MAZAEL. She approaches. SALOME. Must I then see her! thus compell'd!â SCENE II. MARIAMNE, ELIZA, SALOME, MAZAEL, NARBAS. SALOME. I come, A most sincere partaker of thy joy. Benignant Rome to me a brother gives, To thee a husband, crown'd, begirt with power, And worthy Mariamne. His bright deeds His former triumphs, all his future plans To swell the glorious catalogue, the name Of Great with which the applauding world conspires To grace his prosperous fortune, the full trust Of the imperial senate, and it's rights To him consign'd; these are the gifts he brings To lay before thy feet. Henceforth possess His soul, his empire; this with ardent zeal My warmth of friendship covets for thy virtue. And all my cares shall tend more close to draw The happy bond which must for ever join Thy heart and his in one. MARIAMNE. The cares of Salome I neither ask for, nor expect, too well I know her heart, and have with justice scann'd it. I know by what base plots, what mazy snares Her ineffectual hatred hath pursued The life of Mariamne. From herself Judging of me, she dreads perhaps my vengeance. But learn, and mark the difference of our souls! Banish thy groundless fear, for I despise The treacherous crime, nor stoop I to avenge it. I've seen each little art, and pardon all. I leave thee to reflection, to remorse, If after such attempts, such vile endeavours, A heart like thine can listen to their voice. SALOME. Surely too far by prejudice impell'd These taunts severe proceed; against their force I set my conduct, my assiduous toil, And Herod's approbation; Mariamne Will own perhaps the justness of their plea. MARIAMNE. I have already told thee that my mind Will bury in oblivion every wrong. Conscious superiority, and glory Demand this sacrifice. I can forgive, But I can ne'er believe thee. MAZAEL. By the power Who rules above, thrice-honour'd Mariamne I swear, that in my duty, with regretâ MARIAMNE. Mazael no more: for each excuse of thine Is but a new affront. Obey the king, That is thy office. To my tyrants sold, Be thou their faithful drudge, subservient still To the behests of fury and revenge; I shall not in abasement stoop so low, E'er to complain of thee. Why linger here? [To Salome. Go; to the king my secret thoughts disclose; No mighty force is needful to revive That rage within his bosom, which my eyes Shall scorn to soothe. With blackest calumny Your bands of infamous accusers arm! Long have I borne their obloquy unpunish'd, And insolence hath prospered. Still the same; Nought to each base attempt shall I oppose But spotless virtue, and a just disdain. SALOME. Insufferable arrogance!âPerchance Had prudence dictated, she would have taught Not thus with open rashness to have braved The sister of thy Lord. Vain as thou art To think that all must bend and meanly crouch In homage to thy charms: because I seem A desperate loser, that the total sum Of power thy hands can grasp. Mistaken rival! Thy victory may be fatal. Triumph now! But looking forwardâdread the dire event! SCENE III. MARIAMNE, ELISA, NARBAS. ELISA. Ah! why thus urge to passionate excess Foes, ardent to pursue thee to thy ruin? Tho' pausing for a moment, still perhaps Herod's avenging fury o'er thy head Hangs threatening. And when death would fly far distant Instead of warding off the fatal blow, Thou bidd'st him strike. What guardian arm remains To shield thee now? Sohemus, brave defender Of thy illustrious life, whose name long time In fetters of respectful awe hath held Oppressive violence, now leaves the court; With him depart thy hopes. A baleful power Augustus, to thy husband, delegates. Who knows with what resolves, and how disposed He will this day return? Each thought, each deed, Even his love, with terror is attended. Thy conscious heart views all the horrid prospect; Say, hath not madness e'en beyond the tomb Impell'd his gloomy jealousy? my soul Still shudders at the fierce relentless mandate. Why to thy foes thus unreserved? why stoop not To honest art? why not disguise thy feelings? Virtue alas! when not by prudence guided, But leads to danger. MARIAMNE. Just is thy advice. My soul hath been too lofty and unyielding. A stranger to the paths of art, tho' much I need its aid.âI will consult Sohemusâ And the direction of my future fate Resign to him.âLet him approach my presence.â I will expect him here.âBy his advice My actions shall be govern'd.âBold with the plan With which my breast is fraught, th'event uncertain, And greatly to be fear'd.âConduct him hither. [Exit Elisa. SCENE IV. MARIAMNE, NARBAS. MARIAMNE. Thou too, my valued Narbas, help to fix The jarring thoughts of my unsettled mind. Thy virtue, thy attachment to my service, Thy sage experience, have long time possess'd My confidence entire. To thee my heart And all its secret purposes are known; Th'afflictions which I suffer, and the train Of dire calamities which I foresee. Thou hast beheld my mother in the depth Of hopeless anguish, urging me with tears T'accompany her flight. Her soul weigh'd down By no unreal terrors, to her view Presents each moment Herod in his rage, Still in her kindred blood embathed, prepared Before her eyes t'assassinate her daughter. She wishes that my death-devoted children From CÃ¦sar may a father's kindness seek, In Rome, a cradle. Rome, they say, protects All the unfortunate; at Rome's tribunal The prostrate world is judged. I will approach The sovereign arbiter of kings.âYet still, Tho' well I know the voice of reason bids To shun the murtherer's violence, and fate Allows this only choice; fears, conscious fears, Whether from virtue, or from weakness, shakes My inmost soul, while stern reflection tells me 'Tis from a husband I prepare to fly. And my irresolute and faultering steps, Spite of myself, refuse to bear me hence. NARBAS. These generous fears my admiration claim; False tho' they are, they spring from native virtue. Thy heart which self-supported smiles at fortune And her malicious fury, views appall'd Even the faint resemblance of a crime, Yet looks on death unterrified. Oh, banish These secret feelings, fancy's blind suggestions! Open thy eyes! look round! by Herod spilt Thy father's blood following his vengeful steel Here gush'd on thee. Here fell thy much-loved brother, Fell in his early prime. In vain the king His innocence avows, CÃ¦sar deceived Absolves him of the horrid crime in vain. The east revolts, and firm in its opinion Accuses him alone. Oh, place before thee Thy mother's flowing tears, the injury Thy sons sustain, thy father's sacred blood, Herod's fell cruelty, his sister's hate, And (what strikes me with horror, tho' the idea Shocks not thy calm serenity of virtue) Death more than once before thy eyes upraised Grim brandishing his dart.âBut if thy soul Unshaken views these images of dread, And dauntless can the yawning tomb survey, At least protect thy children! leave not them Without defence! already hath the king Wrested the rightful hopes of empire from them. And well thou recollect'st the voice of heaven, The direful prophecy which now long time Hath for their fate kept all thy fears awake, Foretelling that one day a stranger's hand Should to thy father join thy hapless sons. A fierce, obdurate, and unpitying Arab Half this obscure prediction hath accomplish'd. A dire convincing proof, which leaves no doubt But the barbarian will fulfil the whole. To the wild lawless transports of his fury Nothing is sacred. Now, e'en now perhaps He comes to realize his bloody threats, And extirpate the Asmonean race. Seize then th'auspicious moment, and prevent His menaced violence, the moment seize Which saves thy husband from the guilt of murder, And bears these tender victims far away From the keen sword unsheath'd by thy oppressors, Far from th'example of their horrid crimes. Protected by thy royal ancestors, By them brought up e'en from my tender years, Go when thou wilt, and to whatever clime, Behold me ready to attend thy steps. Haste! break these chains! be Rome itself thy goal! Implore the justice of its aweful senate, Confide thy children's fortune to their hands, Own'd and adopted by the Roman people. So pure a virtue with astonishment Will strike Augustus. If his reign indeed Deserves the vaunted names of just and happy, If the transported nations clasp his knees And hail their common parent; if he merits This state of glory, he will undertake Thy cause, and lavish all his care on thee. MARIAMNE. This is no time I see for frigid caution, I hesitate no longer, thy advice; My mother's tears, the peril of my sons, That fate whose power may haply drag me on To more transcendent miseries; all conspire To fix my wavering mind, I yield. Return; Bear thou the tidings, and console my mother. When gloomy night inwraps in shadowy veil These haunts of guilt, let to the palace wall A messenger approach to give me notice. They have prevail'd, necessity requires it, I am prepared to quit this hateful soil. SCENE V. MARIAMNE, SOHEMUS, ELISA. SOHEMUS. I come obsequious to thy high behests, To which I bend as to the laws of heaven; Say shall this hand the sword of vengeance wield Against thy foes? Command, and I obey; Speak, and I rush to action. MARIAMNE. To thy care, O prince, my utmost gratitude is due. Nor do I think in this distressful state My grief will seem too urgent, or the voice Which begs thy succour will be heard in vain; Brave as thou art, protector of th'unhappy. While Herod doubted which might be his lot A throne, or slavery; I solicited The Roman votes; in vain his cruelty My own despair, my interest join'd in vain T'oppose my course; I trod the hallow'd path Of conscious virtue, and pursued my duty. He was my husband, and I strove to serve him; Nor, should th'occasion offer, will again Withold my utmost efforts. But thy aid Now for myself I seek; necessity Requires me from barbaric laws to snatch, The last remains of the unsullied line Of sacred royalty, my hapless sons. I ought long since, far from these guilty scenes Removed, to have demanded an asylum From the just senate, where insulted honour Might have reposed in peace; but while the storms Which civil discord raised wide shook the earth, Mid war, and terror, and destructive rage, I could not seek an hospitable post On that dread shore from whence the tempest sprung. Now to th'afflicted world Augustus gives An Halcyon calm, and o'er all nature spreads Profuse, his blessings; after the long toils Of a detested war, resolved to make Each vanquish'd nation happy. Placed aloft In the majestic capital he sits Judging their kings, curbs their oppressive might, Nor suffers innocence to plead in vain. Who can more justly claim his generous care Than my poor children, weak, and destitute Of all defence? whom from the farthest east Their weeping mother brings, t'implore his aid? Their lives to save, this anxious heart compose, And end my miseries, hope looks up to thee: Thee only I invoke, and that pure soul With noblest ardour ever prompt to guard Plain unsuspecting virtue. Thee alone, To whom is due that even now I breathe This vital air. Oh, give me to escape Far from this fatal land; to thee, my mother, My sons, all, all I trust. The murderer's steel Is raised to strike at innocence, Oh, shield it From the dire blow.âNo answer! Say what means That clouded aspect? Wherefore silent still? Ah! I perceive th'intreating voice of woe Must suffer a repulse. SOHEMUS. NoâI revere Thy orders, and implicitly obey. My guards are ready to attend thy flight To distant Italy; dispose of them, Of me dispose, my heart, my life is thine. Fly the vindictive monarch; break at once These inauspicious ties; his punishment Will equal all his crimes, shouldst thou forsake him, Banish'd by his injustice, ne'er again Shall he that form survey, and well I feel No anguish like to this can rack the soul. Forgive me, from my lips th'expression fell Involuntary; the sharp pang of grief At losing thee, hath forced the secret from me. It is disclosed, nor can it be recall'd. But spite of all my weakness, know respect With the soft impulse intimately blended, Inspires my bosom, every wish love breathes, Is to protect thee, to adore thy virtues, Avenge thy cause, and die. MARIAMNE. I thought, alas! Nor hesitated in the firm belief, That not my interest only, but my glory Was to Sohemus dear; when to preserve My threaten'd life he watch'd these haunts of danger, I thought compassion was the noble motive; Little did I suspect a guilty flame Would add new horrors to the weight of those Which press me to the earth; or in the midst. Of numerous perils, that I e'er should blush At thy benignant care, and dread thy bounty. Yet tho' thy words have struck me to the soul My thanks, my gratitude are thine. All hope Is lost; for ever will I shun thy presence. I will forget thy passion, not thy virtue. Nor will reflect on thee but as a hero, Whose magnanimity till now deserved My warm esteem; perhaps by longer converse This may be altered, I shall therefore leave thee That I may hold it in my mind unshaken. SOHEMUS. Stay, Mariamne, know I still deserve it. Thy glory speaks, I hear no other sound; For it, for thee, I offer up myself A willing sacrifice, fired by thy virtue I too can imitate the bright example, Thee only have I fled, and will again Fly from thy sight. I bid farewel for ever To this abhorred court. Or here remain If needful, to convince thee of my truth, Redouble my respect, but ne'er incur Those censures more, which coming from thy lips O'erwhelm'd my soul with shame. Indifferent To every object but what thee concerns, I'll hazard all, and dare th'extreme of fate. My faithful troops shall guide thee wheresoe'er Thy will directs; within these walls some power I yet retain; the jealous tyrant's vengeance Affrights not me; but should his sword prevail, In thy defence 'twere glorious to expire; To think in my last hour I bled for thee, And to my life preferr'd thy dearer fame. MARIAMNE. Enough; I harbour not the least suspicion. The generosity which prompts thy deeds Will never to unworthy passions stoop Soiling their purity. Yes, I will owe Still more to thee, and make the sum complete. But for my sake thou hurriest on to death, Exposed by me; in thy illustrious steps How can I tread? How can I tarry here? My soul confesses and admires thy virtue. SOHEMUS. Nay, rather by thy mother's tears be guided, And by thy firmness more than her alarms, By thy own danger, not what threatens me. This is no time to trifle with the tyrant, All must be hazarded; that he is king I know it well, but CÃ¦sar is his judge. Surrounded here by perils, Rome alone Is thy asylum.âYet, Oh! bear in mind, The more Sohemus feels thy beauty's power, The greater is his victory o'er himself; That by the kindred ties of royal blood We are united; and that heaven hath form'd My heart deserving thine. MARIAMNE. I doubt it not. And in the depth of my despair consult The Power Supreme, my honour and my duty. SOHEMUS. To them do I appeal, their guidance follow; They from the murderer's hands will rescue thee. END of the SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SOHEMUS, NARBAS, AMMON, ATTENDANTS. NARBAS. The time is urgent, Herod is arrived, He sees again the banks of Judah's stream, And Salome who manages with art The interest which she still retains, already Strives by her counsels to ensnare his soul. The servile courtiers throng in crouds around him; The priests with waving palms expect his presence, And Idamas, whom well thou know'st, precedes him. SOHEMUS. I know his services and past deserts Have been but ill repaid; with zealous love He always hath preserved his faith unshaken For Mariamne; and with sage advice Tempering impetuous warmth, hath often soothed His master's headstrong fury. NARBAS. He will soon Appear before thee. Meantime Mariamne, Just ready to depart, stops, blames herself, And on th'importance of the great design Reflecting, stands astonish'd; tho' prepared, Her rigid virtue dreads the thoughts of flight. Her mother at her feet, with throbbing heart Full fraught with terror, to her children points, Bedews her with her tears, and trembling begs That she will quit this fatal place with speed. Yet still she fluctuates, doubts, and will I fear Prolong too late the dangerous time. But thou With generous care must hasten her departure. On thee depend her fortune and her life, The rarest object, the most precious gift With which consenting heaven e'er bless'd the earth. Stretch forth thy shielding arm, protect, preserve Th'illustrious sufferers, save, Oh, save from death, Th'unhappy offspring of a line of kings. May I inform her that thy guards are ready? Hast thou prepared them? SOHEMUS. All things are disposed With proper care; she may depart this instant. NARBAS. Wilt thou consent too that a faithful servant Should on her flight attend? SOHEMUS. Go; far from hence Accompany her steps; these odious confines Deserve not Mariamne. O ye waves, The sacred freight committed to your trust Receive propitious! And may bounteous heaven Pitying her deep distress, each envious cloud Dispel, and cause a purer sun to shine! And thou, old man, how fortunate thy lot To follow her! True model thou for all Who dwell in courts! thy fate supremely happy, For thou wilt share the smiles of Mariamne. SCENE II. SOHEMUS, AMMON, ATTENDANTS ON SOHEMUS. SOHEMUS. But Herod is already here; the sound Of the shrill brass re-echoing thro' the dome Announces his return. Just Heaven! He comes And strikes my soul with dread; perhaps at once With sudden aim his cruelty will make The work of vengeance sure. Ah! Would the queen Had left for ever these abodes of guilt! Why cannot I accompany her flight? Yet, may I not by absence serve her more? Nor, to preserve such charms, revenge the wrongs Of suffering innocence, can malice dare Reproach me with a crime. But Idamas I see advances. SCENE III. SOHEMUS, IDAMAS, AMMON, ATTENDANTS. SOHEMUS. To the king, my friend The tribute I resign of homage vain, And frivolous respect; officious guests, Unreal types of friendship with the great; Amusive toys cheating the vulgar croud Who gaze with curious eye; display'd with pomp, Loath'd and rejected by the conscious heart. But say, by Rome's arbitrement once more The diadem thy master's brow adorns; Doth he deserve to wear it? Is he come With rage inspired, or breathing gentle peace? Are we to fear repeated cruelties? Or will he bless his people? IDAMAS. May just heaven, Which fills with conscious dread the perjured breast, Far from his sight disperse the mists of error, And dark imposture's clouds! Whoe'er with true And honest hearts shun flattery and guile, By Salome, and Mazael's busy care Are banished from his presence; dreadful secrets I hear they have disclosed; a deadly pale Sits on his cheeks, in agony he raves, And of the fury of his soul expressive, His glowing eyes, on all around him dart The flash of terror. Well to thee is known With what assiduous industry their creatures Thrust back approaching Truth, and her fair form Hold in captivity. This mighty victor Who with the terror of his arms appall'd The souls of kings, this monarch whose exploits, E'en Rome admired, whose wide-spread fame yet fills Astonish'd Asia with dismay, at home Beholds the lustre of his glory fade; Detested by his wife, in treacherous wiles Entangled by his sister, with a mind Torn by suspicions, overwhelm'd by grief. How purposed or inclined he now returns, I must profess my ignorance. While him Each eye beholds with pity, murmurs rise Which prophecy the queen's approaching fate. But none can penetrate his secret thoughts, Or the swift movements of his troubled heart. Now he observes a fierce and savage silence, Then Mariamne's name escapes his lips; He threatens, sighs, and trembling while he speaks, Gives secret orders, which he strait recalls. Her race was ever odious to his soul, Which seems as if desirous to revenge Th'excess of love she kindled in his breast. Much do I fear for her. SOHEMUS. Enough; the queen Is then in danger. Ammon, follow me. Haste! Let me save unguarded innocence. IDAMAS. Thus wilt thou shun the presence of the king? When thy high rank, authority and virtue, Might curb obtrusive malice, and restrain Its tongue intent on mischief? SOHEMUS. Nobler cares, And more important interests prompt me now With warm inspiring breath. My first great task To cross and intercept the guilty purpose E'er it o'ertake the crime. [Exit. IDAMAS. What new impending storms, what dreadful evils Do I foresee? Thou mighty God of Israel Oh, change the heart of Herod! SCENE IV. HEROD, MAZAEL, IDAMAS, ATTENDANTS. HEROD. Hah! doth Sohemus too avoid my sight? Where'er I tread what horrors rise before me! Heaven, am I always destin'd to inspire No sentiments but those of hate or terror! Is every human bosom closed against me? Odious to Mariamne, to my people, And even to myself, I wear, alas, A joyless crown: and only am arrived To reap the dreadful harvest of afflictions Which my own hands had sownâO God! O God! MAZAEL. Calm these tumultuous passions, I conjure thee, These groundless transports. HEROD. Wretched that I am, What have I done? MAZAEL. Shall Herod weep? That prince So fortunate, so wise in all his plans, Parthia's dire scourge, the glorious friend of Rome? Call these resplendent titles to thy mind By victory won, by Anthony confirm'd. Think when Augustus placed thee by his side, Marching distinguish'd from the croud of kings, Selected by his choice. Submissive, lo! Jerusalem reveres thy sacred laws, By right of conquest thine; and shines once more Guarded by thee, in all her ancient splendour. While she her monarch's wish'd return beholds Fortune's prime favorite. Sure never king Could boast such happiness in peace or war. HEROD. No, all is one vast blank; the spacious earth Contains not in its ample round for me A single blessing. Fate hath plunged me down Into the gulph of misery, and t'augment Still more the weight of her incumbent horrors, I know I have deserved them. IDAMAS. Might I speak Unblamed, and to my royal master's ear Bring honest truth; it is incircling love Which fixes firm th'august and sacred throne, Not servile awe; the King, whose influence cheers The hearts of others, feels the sun-shine pure Of true delight irradiating his own. Ah! Who would always struggle with the waves Of anxious care, when its impoison'd source Would at his bidding cease at once to flow? No more, my lord, permit unworthy tongues With vile insidious calumny to wound Thy honour and repose; nor flatterers base Far from thee to exile the faithful few Who pine in secret, wishing, but in vain To serve their sovereign; then would Israel soon Charm'd by thy virtuesâ HEROD. Dost thou really think That Herod ever can be loved? So changed, So very different from his former self? MAZAEL. E'en to the height of envy all adore Thy unexampled greatness. IDAMAS. One alone, One heart resists, and that too may be conquered. HEROD. I'm a barbarian, and unfit to reign. IDAMAS. Thy grief is just; and if for Mariamneâ HEROD. That name, that fatal name, alas! condemns me. Thence keen reproach upbraids me, and displays Before my agonizing soul th'excess Of cruelty and weakness. MAZAEL. In her bosom Dwells never-yielding hate; she shuns thy sight. HEROD. I flew to her's. MAZAEL. Indeed! HEROD. Can that surprize thee? Do not these starts of passion, the big tear Forced from me by remorse, this sudden change, This vehemence of grief; say, do not all Plainly demonstrate that I came from her? Harrass'd with doubts, urged on by hate and love, I left the insipid croud, the tedious court, And secretly retired to visit her. Heavens! What an interview! What dreadful struggles Of my conflicting thoughts! What tortures dire! In her indignant eyes was my injustice Clearly pourtray'd; yet, trembling with alarms, Her looks wild-straying dared not fall on me. And tho' I wept, methought I seem'd still more The object of her terror. MAZAEL. All, my lord, Conspires to prove, that her invenom'd hate Thy utmost kindness never can disarm. This dangerous respect enflames her pride. HEROD. Hated by Mariamne! Gracious heaven! I have too well deserved it; yes, reduced To fortune's worst extreme I must forgive Her hatred of a wretch so stain'd with guilt. MAZAEL. With guilt! Ah, sire, can memory ever fail To recollect the conduct of the queen Which justifies thy deeds? Her fierce contempt? Her insolence of rage? Her dark designs? Her father's plots against thee? Did she not Derive her being from thy bitterest foe? Hircanus with a mind that teem'd with peril Always betray'd thee. Th'AsmonÃ¦an Faction Was grown to such a height of daring power That nought but that successful strokeâ HEROD. No more. He was her father, and I should have spared him. But rendered callous by the lust of empire, My soul was deaf to every other sound. Sad victims to my barbarous policy Her kindred fell. By me the father bled, The daughter was proscribed. I wish'd to hate her; Too well my conscious heart hath known to load Her breast with woe; and heaven in its revenge Hath doom'd me to the fond excess of love. IDAMAS. Trust me, when merit claims our warm affection, It is a virtue, not a weakness in us. Worthy the bounties heav'n hath lavish'd on thee, Amid its choicest blessings rank thy love. HEROD. Frenzy which I detest! Hircanus! Oh! Ye sacred manes! IDAMAS. Banish from thy thoughts The fatal recollection, MAZAEL. And the queenâ May she too draw th'oblivious veil around her! HEROD. O wretched father! More unhappy husband! These horrors heap'd on horrors, blood on blood, The murder of her sire, and all the afflictions Which I have pour'd on her devoted head, Endear her still the more.âOh, if her heartâ Her faithâwhy this delay? Know, Idamas, Amply will I atoneâGo seek, inform her My soul enslaved, and subject to her will, Lays at her feet my glory, throne, and life. Amongst her sons I'll choose a successor. She hath accused my sister as the cause Of her calamities. It is enough; This instant Salome shall quit our court; A nearer tye demands the sacrifice. Henceforth shall Mariamne rule alone With power unbounded. MAZAEL. Hah! Will Herod thenâ HEROD. I willâ'tis fix'd as fate. My heart beholds her, Considers her from this auspicious moment As heaven's most precious gift, which I receive With reverential gratitude. How strong The force of love! I feel the conqueror here, To Mariamne shall I owe my virtue. Asia hath seen, with shame I must confess it, A splendid, but a barbarous monarch reign. Dreaded, admired, respected by my people, But hated; circled by adoring slaves, Without a single friend. Too long my heart Stoop'd to a sister's influence; than myself More cruel in her sanguinary schemes, She deluged with my subjects' blood the land, With added terrors stretch'd my sceptre forth And crush'd them with its weight. While Mariamne Felt all their woes, forgot her own distress, Lost in delightful sympathy for them, And to her husband's presence brought their tears: It is determined. I will be more just, But less severe; and by the public good Will strive to make her happy; while beneath A milder sway, the state shall breathe anew. My soul is altered, in a different mould By Mariamne form'd. Suspicious fear Hurled from the throne, my hands shall curb oppression, And cloathe each subject's cheek in smiles of joy. I will reign o'er them like a citizen, And gain all hearts, that I may merit her's. Goâfind herâwhy this tardiness? nor fail The agonies of my repentant soul, And all its wild emotions to describe With faithful tongue. Tell her that my remorse Is equal to my rage.âGoâflyâreturn. What do I see? My sister! Thou retire. [To Mazael. To what vexations is my life condemn'd! SCENE V. HEROD, SALOME. SALOME. I share them all; nor can I but express My wonder, that Sohemus and the queen Should thus avoid thy presence, and betray So little of affection and respect. HEROD. One I must blame, the other I excuse. Press not the subject further. SALOME. This Sohemus Whom justly thou condemn'st, hath always kindled The queen's resentment. HEROD. Ah! What countless horrors Have burst upon our heads! I seek to end them. Stern and implacable, I purchased nought But fear from others, misery to myself. Too long revenge and hate have pour'd their streams Of baleful venom o'er my sad abode. Thine and the queen's too ranc'rous enmity Would prove a never-failing source of torment. For thy repose, my sister, for my own, That we may both be happy, let us part. Quit this unfortunate and gloomy mansion. It must be so. SALOME. Just Heaven! what do I hear? O fatal enemy! HEROD. Thy king commands, Thy brother shall intreat thee. Oh may ne'er This hapless brother be compell'd henceforth To give one cruel order! Never more Unrein stern vengeance! Ne'er shed blood again! My life hath been a scene of restless tumult, Oh, spare me, nor imbitter what remains. Murmur; complain of me, lament thyself; But leave the court. SALOME. Ah, sire, I murmur not, I utter no complaint; it is enough That just and necessary in thy sight My banishment appears? taught to comply E'en with thy least desires, to thy command I yield a prompt obedience. Tho' my heart Glows with the injury, thou shalt not see me Attest before thee nature's sacred tye, Her voice can seldom pierce the ear of kings; And where the passions dwell, relationship Pleads its just rights in vain. I shall not boast That zeal, and warm sincerity of friendship, Which now begins to be displeasing to thee; Much less awaken memory with the thought Of all my various services o'erpast. Ah! I perceive a glance hath quite effaced them And left a total blank.âBut say, can Herod Believe that Mariamne will forget The fatal order pointed at her life? The constant object of her fear, wilt thou Fear her no longer? Are her wishes hid? Her sentiments unknown? Who shall prevent By wholesome counsel the revengeful blow Which now her soul may in its raging mood With ease inflict? What watchful eyes intent To guard thy life, shall trace her mazy plots, And every snare unravel? Who shall curb Her headstrong violence? Dost thou imagine That when by tenderness disarm'd, and placed Within her power, the traitor love will speak And charm her from her purpose! Hah! Will scorn Like hers excessive, that inhuman mind Inspiring deeds of horrorâ HEROD. Ah! Permit me To doubt a while her scorn, and let my soul Enjoy the flattering hope that I may Recover her affection; if I err, still, Respect my error, nor thus idly strive To undeceive me. I would fain believe, Nay it is riveted within my breast, Proud as thou art, that thy malevolence Raised a barrier betwixt the queen and me. That thy inflexible and barbarous nature Hath hardened Mariamne's heart against me, And but for thee I had been less detested. SALOME. Oh, could'st thou guess, could'st thou but comprehend To what intentâ HEROD. No more; I will not hear thee. Let Mariamne threaten at her will A life, beneath the load of which I groan. Let her cut short its course; If die I must, At least the hand I love will guide the blow. SALOME. Ah! I can hold no longer; nor by silence Foster thy blind delusion; tho' exposed To swift destruction, I am bound to serve thee. Let the dire thunder burst upon my head, Yet will I speak.âO most ill-fated husband! Know Mariamne, and be whelm'd with shame, What is the fierce disdain which arms her breast? Or what her hate?âAnother is beloved. HEROD. Another is beloved! Barbarian! Hah! And darest thou in my presence cast a stain On such uncommon virtue! Is it thus Thou stab'st thy brother? Thus thou bid'st farewel, Leaving behind deep fix'd th'invenom'd steel? And Discord waving round her blazing torch? And shame, and rage and jealousy to tear, To harrow up my soul?âHah! Mariamne!â Impossible. I will not deign t'inquire Into the groundless charge; thy noxious counsels Have ruled with sway too absolute; long time Have I believed thee, heaven avenges now My fond credulity. I have been doom'd For ever doom'd, to fix my love on those Who hated me the mostâyes, here, at me, At me alone thy persecution aims. SALOME. Nay then at distance from theeâ HEROD. Stir not hence. Another is beloved!âGive to my sight, Shew me, thou cruel monitress, whose blood Must quench this vengeance unessay'd before. Pursue thy work, and make my woes complete. SALOME. Since 'tis thy willâ HEROD. StrikeâLo! my throbbing heart! Speak, name the traitor; but whoe'er he be, Think that on thee too my revenge may fall, For thou hast chaced my darling error from me. Thus warn'd; proceed. SALOME. No matter. HEROD. Speak at once. SALOME. It isâ SCENE VI. HEROD, SALOME, MAZAEL. MAZAEL. Oh, haste, my gracious lord! nor suffer The perpetration of so foul a crime! The queen this instant is prepared for flight, Sohemus bears her hence. HEROD. Hah! Mariamne! Sohemus! Where am I! All-righteous heaven! MAZAEL. Her mother and her sons have left the palace; The means, by which t'effect this shameful purpose, Sohemus hath devised. A secret escort Is station'd near the walls, and Mariamne Waits but their signal to depart; she goes, And thy fond eyes will ne'er behold her more. HEROD. Hah! The dark spell dissolves; the orient day Shines bright around; mark, Salome, and know Thy brother by his kindled rage; away! Let us surprize the traitress; and then determine Whether this breast still bears the soul of Herod, And still can urge the terrors of revenge. END of the THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. SALOME, MAZAEL. MAZAEL. Thus soaring o'er thy rival, who is lost Beyond recovery; reinstated firm In Herod's favour; every wish complete; Why thus to melancholy thoughts a prey? Avenging his own injuries, the king Is thy avenger; to the highest pitch His fury swells; with horror I beheld The fatal evils which myself had caused. Thou too the dreadful spectacle hast seen; The trembling slaves pierced by his desperate sword Weltering in blood; the queen beside them sunk, Pale, faint and half expiring; o'er her head His arm up-raised, prepared to take her life; Her agonizing children, bathed in tears, Struggling to grasp his knees, and offering each Their tender bosoms to the murderer's steel. What wouldst thou more? What fears can reach thee now? SALOME. I fear the king, those powerful charms I fear Which he adores; that arm so prompt to strike, So easily unnerved; in short that anger So soon enflamed, but which irresolute And blind for ever, loses all its force In sudden transports. From his frantic fit What gain shall I experience! Will Sohemus Cast a more favourable eye on me? No, this will fix his hatred; and my brother Unhappy as he is, thus forced to punish A faithless wife, will never cease t'upbraid me With her dishonour, and his own misfortunes. E'en now his heart forgives her; and in secret Is torn with inexpressive pangs to lose This darling object, while on me alone, Could he pursue his will, would vengeance fall. Ah! What perplexities, what doubts impede My fatal triumph! twice, in one short day, My destiny hath changed, twice have I seen Stern ire by love succeeded; we are ruin'd Should he again behold her. SCENE II. HEROD, SALOME, MARIAMNE. MAZAEL. Lo, he comes! What inward horror agitates his frame! SALOME. Hast thou made sure the destined work of vengeance? MAZAEL. Now heaven forefend that my exciting voice Betwixt my royal master and his queen Should rashly interfere, and strive to urge Wisdom and mercy to remorseless rage! But her revolt Sohemus first inspired, And he is her protector still against thee. Not that I bid you seek revenge on him; But rather to beware his dark designs, And dread the secret stroke of treachery. HEROD. Alas! I fear not him. MAZAEL. Yet think, my lord, How quick adultery passes on to murder, It is its certain progress. HEROD. Hah! What say'st thou? MAZAEL. Sohemus who could ne'er disguise his feelings, Hath always plainly shewn himself the more Thy deadly foe. Nay those whose guilty aid He had suborn'd, have openly declared Thy life should be attempted. HEROD. Mariamne! Thy hate strikes deep, that is thy greatest crime. Oh! Tho' thou canst not but approve, my sister, This rage which animates my breast, thy eyes Viewing my sufferings, drop the tear of pity. Whom hath my heart to lean upon but thee? Its only friend? A fatal dear delusion, Possess'd me wholly; and while every care Was busily employ'd to make her happy, Thou wert the sacrifice; I number'd thee Amongst my bitterest foes, and for her scorn, And rancorous spirit, persecuted thee. By all that tenderness so ill-repay'd, I swear, e'er yonder circling orb completes His daily journey, thou shalt be revenged. Ah! The more absolute her power, the more With justice fired I pant, I burn t'inflict Severest punishment.âAlas! my heart Ne'er own'd a passion but for her alone! I lov'd, abhorr'd, ador'd the faithless woman. And thou, Sohemus, thou shalt not escape The fate thy crimes deserve!âHold! That were mercyâ No, in thy dearer self thou shalt be slainâ She who despised this soul sincere, who lavish'd On thee her fond affection, whom I once Prized as a countless treasure, shall expire Before thy eyes in torture.âOh! to view Her perjured blood follow my vengeful steel And gush in streams on thee! Hah! Good, most good, Thou lovest her; and thy minion's death will give The sharpest pangs, and satiate my revenge. MAZAEL. Let then the precious opportunity Be speedily embraced; and whilst Sohemus Remains at distance, and his troops are scattered Far from these walls, attempt at once, and perfect The easy work of vengeance. SALOME. But conceal Thy deep resentment from the public eye, Spare to thyself the horror of a sight So dreadfully affecting: and removed From this sad dwelling, conscious of thy shame, Fly from the painful images which here Thy matchless wrongs will always raise before thee. HEROD. I see her crime, her aim, and why Sohemus Thy hand so contumeliouly refused. SALOME. Waste not a thought on me; consider well What grosser injuries are thine. HEROD. She lived With innocence her bosom friend till now. Of nothing but her violence of temper Could I accuse her, that presumptuous boldness With which she ever thwarted my desires, Her sullen discontent, and fix'd contempt Of all my kindred.âWhat affronts, what insults Have I not borne from th'AsmonÃ¦an line! But is it possible her soul could stoop Thus meanly to dishonour me? SALOME. Oh, banish These thoughts, my lord! Nor thus indulge reflection! Compose thy soul. HEROD. Yes! I once more will see her, And with a searching eye confound her guilt. Urge home her crime, and force her to reply. Behold her shuddering at th'approach of death And begging mercy, which she shall not find. SALOME. Hah! Wilt thou then admit her to thy presence? HEROD. Fear not. My soul is fix'd in its resolves; She dies. In vain, can perfidy like hers Hope aught from love o'er past. My heart is closed, A bar eternal shuts all pity out. Her eyes, which knew, alas! too well to charm, Have lost their power, I feel resentment strong, Her sight will kindle it to furious rage. Guards, bring the queen before us. I but wish To see, to hear, and punish her. My sister, Leave me a moment to myself.âAway! And bear my orders. You mean time retire. SCENE III. HEROD alone. Again behold her!âWhither tends that purpose? Oh, Herod, say, can thy bewildered heart Answer the question? Hah! Glares not her guilt Like broadest noon? Art thou not deeply wrong'd? Completely injured? What hast thou to do With ought besides? What canst thou hope to gain From this dread converse? Will it stamp thy heart With feelings such as her's! Ah! Well thou know'st Her soul abhors thee. Dost thou seek revenge? How? Why then lives she still? But thou wouldst fain See her once more.âO abject wretch! O mind Unworthy of a crown! Go, sigh before her, Haste to pronounce her pardon. Go, contemplate And gaze with fondness on the charms, so long So fatally adored. No, she shall dieâ The oath hath past my lipsâher death is sworn. It shall be spiltâmy foe's detested bloodâ The blood which flows from th'AsmonÃ¦an race, And swells her veins; the blood which rankled ever With hate t'ward me, with never-conquer'd hate By me regarded. But she comes! O heaven! A sight which blasts my vision! SCENE IV. MARIAMNE, HEROD, ELIZA, GUARDS. ELIZA. Summon all Your wonted fortitude, my royal mistress, For lo the king! MARIAMNE. Where am I? Whither tend My faultring steps! O Power Supreme! I die, I see my fate before me. HEROD. Wherefore thus Trembles my inmost soul as I behold her? MARIAMNE. Support me, I am faint, each nerve gives way. ELISA. A little onwardâ MARIAMNE. Oh! What torture! HEROD. Heavens! My tongue refuses utterance. MARIAMNE. Wherefore, say, Am I commanded hither! Wilt thou take With thy own hands the weak remains of life; A life, the source of misery to us both? I am prepared, strike, give the welcome blow, The only blessing I expect from Herod. HEROD. Thou shalt be fully gratified, revenge Stand eager for the deed. But first declare The cause, and vindicate thy shameful flight. So long, so oft provoked, when I forgot Each past offence, and my fond yielding heart Still lavish'd all its tenderness upon thee, The partner of my empire and my glory, Why harbour in thy breast this black design? To what intent? What evil genius sway'd, And with malicious hate inspired thy soul? MARIAMNE. To what intent! Can Herod ask that question? But vain reproaches are untimely now. Yet say that far from hence I sought to find Some place of safety, say that Mariamne For once revolting from an husband's power, His rights forgot, and swerved from her obedience. Call to thy mind th'illustrious line of kings From whence I drew my birth; consider all My present perils, and my past misfortunes, And then condemn my purpose if thou darest. HEROD. But when thy shameful passion for a traitor; When for Sohemusâ MARIAMNE. Cease, thou false accuser; My life is thine; but exquisitely cruel Heap not a load of infamy upon me. Let me without a blush, without a stain Enter the residence of death. At least Think on our sacred union, recollect The nuptial bonds which link'd my fame with thine. Pierce, if thou wilt, this heart; here plunge thy swordâ But in the dreadful act, respect the names Of wife, and husband. HEROD. O perfidious! Base! Well it becomes thee to pronounce those names, Thy condemnation, and my foul dishonour. Thy scorn bears witness, thy aversion proves, With clear conviction proves, that thou art guilty. MARIAMNE. Fore-judged and doom'd to death, my love or hate Can weigh but little in the breast of Herod. Henceforth what right dost thou pretend to claim To Mariamne's heart, which thou hast tortured With grief's severest pangs, with fear and horror? Thou, who with ruthless mind for five long years Hast but insulted o'er my deep distress, And mark'd my days with misery? Thou, whose hand Detested tyrant, all my kindred slew? Thou, who wert crimson'd with my father's blood Before these eyes expiring? Ah! Relentless! Had thy suspicious fury singled out My life alone, this heart entirely thine Without a sigh had met the fatal stroke, Had loved, and bless'd thee. But here curb thy rage, And let my death suffice; do not protract My woes beyond the grave, preserve my children, Spare thy own blood, nor punish them because They spring from me; Oh, Herod! Shew to them A father's kindness! Thou wilt know hereafter, And haply when too late; reflect with pity On their ill-destin'd mother; thou wilt know The value of a heart which thou alone Of all the human race e'er dared suspect. A heart which could not stoop (perhaps too proud) To hide its feelings, and with little arts Bring to its lure the passions of a master, Which bore its virtue spotless to the tomb, And which, but for thyself, had loved thee, Herod. HEROD. What do I hear? What magic force, what power Of agency invincible, controuls My furious soul, and tears me from myself? Hah! Mariamne.â MARIAMNE. Cruel and inhuman! HEROD. O weak credulity! O headstrong frenzy! MARIAMNE. Thus sunk; with misery and disgrace o'erwhelm'd, In pity take a life beneath my care. HEROD. My own is thine; Oh! They are firmly bound, Connected everlastingly together! Madness hath reign'd! My senses are restored. Let every loitering fear be put to flight. Those looks! That face! Ah! How could I resist them! Thy triumph is complete. No argument Is wanted now; excuses would be vain. My heart acquits thee, every tender thought Vouches thy innocence. Dost thou require Still more? What wouldst thou to atone my crime? O heaven! O powerful love! I now implore, And tremble in my turn. Wilt thou remain Alone inexorable? Urge my guilt, When I have pardon'd all? O Mariamne, Here let our mutual persecutions cease. Are our hearts form'd but to detest each other? Must we still live in fear? Nor ever banish Gloomy distrust? Oh! Let us stop at once The progress of our woes, and end their course! From this auspicious hour begin to reign, And stretch the rod of empire o'er ourselves! Oh! Draw not back thy hand, but frankly give it, The sacred pledge of amity restore. MARIAMNE. Canst thou desire this hand? All-righteous heaven! To whom I bend! Thou know'st what blood of mine Still reeks upon his own! HEROD. Hah! Say I slew Thy father and my king, and spilt his blood That I might share the crown with thee; what gain Follow'd the deed? Thy hate. Most just I grant. Neither do I repine, for all my guilt Stands wide display'd before me. But this theme Is trite, and obvious; his untimely death, The wrongs thy children have sustain'd, these form The least of Herod's crimes, his savage rage Hath e'en to Mariamne been extended, And for a moment I detested thee. Nay more, with jealous rashness dared suspect thee. Oh! put thy virtue to the strongest proof, And let it nobly struggle to forgive me! A generosity like this, no heart But thine can manifest. View'st thou my guilt In all it's native colours? Oh, more bright In its pure radiance will thy goodness shine, Mov'd to compassion by those hallow'd ties, Which have together link'd us in misfortunes. Thou seest what wild emotions drive me on, Thou seest my weakness. Oh! Regard thyself! These agonies of woe, this grief sincere Must not be view'd with scorn. Dear cruel object Of my excess of tenderness and rage! If to the whispering of angelic pity Thy heart is sensible, calm (for thou canst) Those horrid tumults which o'erwhelm my soul! Turn not thy eyes aside.âMy Mariamneâ MARIAMNE. Stern as thou art, may I believe these transports Spring from a true repentance? May I hope That real grief is thine? Remorse unfeign'd? HEROD. Thou may'st. Oh! take and mould me to thy will, So I but soothe thy hatred. Every fierce And boistrous passion, all my savage fury By thee was kindled: thy affection lost, Humanity withdrew, and dire revenge, And barbarous manners all my soul possess'd. Oh! may my tears wash out the mutual stain! I swearâ SCENE V. HEROD, MARIAMNE, ELISA, ONE OF THE GUARDS. GUARD. My lord, the people are in arms; The scaffold raised by Salome's command They have destroy'd, stain'd with the smoaking blood Of th'executioners. Meanwhile Sohemus Issues his orders to the multitude, And even to thy troops, as sovereign master. He comes this way, and rapidly advances. HEROD. Hah! At the time when humbled at thy feetâ Couldst thou perfidiousâ MARIAMNE. O, my lord, thy thoughtsâ HEROD. And is my life thus coveted? Thy malice Shall soon be amply satisfied. But know That I will drag thee with me to the tomb, Spite of thyself we there shall be united. Guards! Watch your prisoner! SCENE VI. HEROD, MARIAMNE, SALOME, MAZAEL, ELISA, GUARDS. SALOME. The rebellious people To fury raised by Mariamne's name Demand thy life, my brother; do not meet These vengeful Hebrews, in their rage they come By force to bear her hence. HEROD. Let us away! They shall behold their king. I fly to seek them. But thou shalt answer for this state of danger, For all my woes, thou traitress. Salome, We leave her to thy charge, secure her well. MARIAMNE. I fear not death; but witness for me heavenâ MAZAEL. The foe, my lord, appears. HEROD. Haste! Let us on!â But, shall her guilt meantime be left unpunish'd? No, her perfidious blood alone can wash The stain awayâIt is resolvedâmy willâ Alas! In this extreme my anxious soul Can fix on nothing; but to wish for death, But to rush on and meet the welcome blow. END of the FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. MARIAMNE, ELISA, GUARDS. MARIAMNE. Soldiers, retire! At least permit your queen A moment's privacy. [The soldiers retire to a corner of the stage.] Hast thou survey'd, From thy pure residence, all-righteous power! And is this state of woe decreed by thee!â Sprung from illustrious blood, nursed in the arms Of purple greatness, bless'd with all which seem'd To promise happy days, and firmly fix The step of sure prosperity; all this Hath but conspired to poison life, and swell Its stream with fuller tides of deadly venom. O birth! O Youth! And thou, whose treacherous light Enflamed my vanity, pernicious beauty! Flattering illusion, winding thro' my soul! Unreal shadow of felicity! Ah! How hast thou betray'd me with thy wiles! Beneath the guilty throne which I ascended, Eternal discontent, and gloomy care Have dug the grave, which now expands before me. In Jordan's flood I saw my brother perish, My father, pierced by Herod's sword expire. Doom'd by his cruel rage to fall a victim, My virtue, my integrity remain Still sacred, and my own; yet even these Slander dares taint with odious spots of shame. O Power Supreme! Whose chastisements severe Prove guileless innocence, my prayers shall not Invoke thy aid, or call thy vengeance down! The bright example of my ancestors Which I pursue, hath taught me to behold The face of death without a single fear, Without one conscious stain. From life's warm source Receive my blood! But oh! Defend my fame! Curb their wild licence, let not my oppressors With impious tongues pollute my memory, Or canker'd falsehood riot o'er my tomb. Esteem, regret, the homage of the heart Is virtue's best revenge.âHah! What alarms! What dreadful shrieks are these! The palace rings With loud confusion and the din of arms! I am the cause. Alas! For me they fight, For me they bleed. They burst the shatter'd gates, Hah! What do I behold! SCENE II. MARIAMNE, SOHEMUS, ELISA, AMMON. SOLDIERS OF HEROD AND SOHEMUS. SOHEMUS. Away vile slaves Who hold your queen in bondage! Ruffians, hence! Bind them in chains! Away! [The guards go off with the soldiers of Herod.] Now Mariamne Haste! Our attempt hath prosper'd, use it wellâ Fly! Follow me! March o'er the heaps of slain! Thy persecutors boast their power no more, They could not bar my entrance. Mazael lies Bathed in his traitrous blood, and this right hand At least hath half avenged thee. Linger not. Seize this auspicious moment. From the storm Shelter that form august. Haste! Follow me! MARIAMNE. Sohemus, no. Tho' generous thy intent To snatch me from my enemies, I dare not Accept it now. After the vile affront, The grimed spot which Herod's jealousy Hath on my glory cast, I should deserve it, Could I receive thy proffer'd aid. That aid Hath more of danger and inspires my soul With greater dread than his barbarity. To owe my life to thee; reproach and shame Attend the deed; the very purpose, honour Now constitutes a crime. This I must expiate, And wait, with patience wait, till death acquits me. SOHEMUS. What words are these! Alas! Ill-fated princess, Destruction instantly may light upon thee. Dubious the conflict: urgent is the time. Oh! Think with terror on the approach of Herod Arm'd with despair! MARIAMNE. On conscious shame alone I look with terror, and I know my duty. SOHEMUS. Am I then doom'd for ever to offend, When most I strive to serve thee?âBut I go Spite of thyself t'accomplish thy revenge. Yes, I will meet the tyrant, whom in vain Thou would'st preserve; again I seek the fight, And this keen swordâ MARIAMNE. Stay; I detest a triumph Purchased by crimes; to me the life of Herod Is sacred, and demands my care; his rightsâ SOHEMUS. Are forfeited by his ingratitude. MARIAMNE. By the most hallow'd tiesâ SOHEMUS. They all are broken. MARIAMNE. Duty unites us. SOHEMUS. Guilt divorces you. Retard no more my eager step. Revenge Thy wrongs on the barbarian! Oh! preserve So many virtues! MARIAMNE. Thou dishonour'st them. SOHEMUS. He seeks thy life. MARIAMNE. 'Twere sacrilege in me To aim at his. SOHEMUS. His hands are drench'd in blood, Thy father's blood. MARIAMNE. I know what he hath done, And what I ought to do. Prepared to meet His utmost fury, here I stand resign'd. Th'example of his guilt my soul disdains. SOHEMUS. O fortitude! O constancy! O heart Not to be shaken! Gods! How doubly black Appear the crimes of Herod, when compared With this transcendent virtue! Thy commands Not to protect thee, urge me but the more To disobedience. What thy honour shuns, Mine bids me execute. No power can stay, Or daunt me in my course. I fly to find This odious tyrant, and repair the time Which I have lost, not fighting in thy cause. MARIAMNE. O prince!â SCENE III. MARIAMNE, ELISA, GUARDS. MARIAMNE. Alas! He's gone, and would not hear me. Heaven! Gracious heaven! restrain his vengeful sword! Let not more blood be spilt! Preserve my subjects! On this devoted head pour all your wrath! Spare even Herod! SCENE IV. MARIAMNE, ELISA, NARBAS. GUARDS. MARIAMNE. Narbas! Is it thou? Where hast thou left my children? Where my mother? NARBAS. The wrath of Herod reaches not to them. In this extreme of fate, unhappy queen, Sole object of his jealousy and rage, Fear only for thyself. Sohemus named, His soul takes fire, and if he conquers him, Death is thy portion. Even while I speak, E'en at this instant comes the barbarous Zares, With secret orders fraught. Oh! Quit the palace! Dare to protect thyself! The people love thee, Appear before them; in their guardian arms They will receive thee. Tho' depress'd and fallen, Thy presence will restore their ancient virtue. Rouse then our faithful Hebrews! Let thy voice Excite our priests! All Judah will defend The offspring of their much-loved kings! Away! Now prove thy fortitude, this is the time To conquer or to die. Let me intreat theeâ MARIAMNE. Mistaken man! True fortitude of soul Knows how to suffer; but will ne'er urge on Rebellious crouds with impious arm high-raised T'assault their prince. Oh! I should feel my cheeks Glow with shame's deepest blush, if overcome With fear, the least intent against his life Had e'er surprised my heart; if, for a moment, I had indulged one thought of my revenge; Or borrowed the most transient gleam of hope From his destruction. If I must perform Some desperate action, let it be a deed Nobler and more illustrious; and methinks Heaven prompts it now; yes, blinded as he is With dark suspicions, Herod shall at length Know Mariamne; mid the thickest fight I rush, and arm'd with mutual fury, part Him and Sohemus, then resign my life To his disposal. Tho' to day I fled From his stern vengeance, exiled by his crimes, His danger hath recall'd me; glory speaks, Its dictates I obey; and fly to save His life who thirsts for mine. NARBAS. Ah! Whither tend Thy devious steps? What madness thus impellsâ MARIAMNE. Oh! I am lost! He comes! 'Tis he himself! SCENE V. HEROD, MARIAMNE, ELIZA, NARBAS, IDAMAS. GUARDS. HEROD. Have they then met! Immortal power! Thus stain'd With perfidy, this moment is thy last. MARIAMNE. Yet, hear me Herod, suffer not thy selfâ HEROD. Begone. Guards follow her. MARIAMNE. Eternal Justice! SCENE VI. HEROD, IDAMAS, GUARDS. HEROD. Let me not hear her hated name again; Abandon'd false one!âWell, my brave defenders! Followers in arms! Say, are there yet more foes? IDAMAS. All are subdued. The Hebrews lowly bend Imploring mercy. In his blood embathed Sohemus lies; the victory is thine. This day with added glory decks thy fame. HEROD. With glory! Oh! IDAMAS. 'Tis painful to reflection. Slaughter hath raged enough to satisfy Thy wounded honour. With his latest breath Sohemus witness'd Mariamne's truth. HEROD. Now then shall tardy vengeance punish guilt. This worthless object which my utmost care Could never fix as mine, I cast away For ever from me. Now my reign begins. With blindness smit, too long this fatal passion Hath been my only blot, my only weakness. Die thou ungrateful! Her seducive charms, Snatch them, oblivion. Her polluted name Henceforth no tongue pronounce! But above all Within my heart; perish her memory! Are all things ready for this sacrifice Which justice claims? IDAMAS. They are, my lord. HEROD. Alas! How quickly they obey me! Oh! What torture! What agony of woe! And must she perish! All ready, saidst thou? IDAMAS. By the guards secured; Too soon will thy revenge be satisfied. HEROD. She courted her destruction; forced my soul Struggling reluctant. Seal'd then be her doom. Bane to my peace, obstrusive thoughts, away! Oh! For her sake alone I wish'd to live, I would have died for her. How sunk! How lost! O, perjured Mariamne, headlong plunged Into the gulph of misery by thy guilt! SCENE THE LAST. HEROD, IDAMAS, NARBAS, HEROD. Hah Narbas! Why this haste! Just heaven! In tears! That face of woe! What terrors at the sight! Pierce thro' my inmost soul! NARBAS. My lordâ HEROD. Say on; Proceed, thou dreadful harbinger of ill. NARBAS. My faultering voice dies on my lips; I wouldâ But cannotâ HEROD. Mariamneâ NARBAS. Oh! What pangs Of sharp remorse! Of unavailing grief! HEROD. Is then the fatal moment?â NARBAS. It is past. She is no more. HEROD. Dead! Dead! Great God! NARBAS. Oh! Learn What a superiour blessing thou hast lost: What blood, of worth unspeakable, thy hand Hath rashly shed. This debt her memory claims, And virtue basely wrong'd; nay, 'tis a debt I owe to thee, to thy insulted honour. No Herod, no, she never injured thee; Her heart was always pure. E'en when Sohemus Fought in her cause, I saw her shun his aid With detestation; I beheld her fly To save thy life, regardless of her own. HEROD. What do I hear! Beyond example wretched! O, dire extremity of hopeless anguish! What hast thou said? NARBAS. That moment, when her heart With noblest animation fraught, inspired The generous purpose, came thy cruel orders, And she was led to death. While Salome With speed malicious hurried on her doom. HEROD. Monster! By my reluctant justice spared! Fell monster! What avengement waits thy crimes! Oh! That her blood, that mineâNarbas proceed, And kill me quite with the soul-harrowing tale. NARBAS. What language shall I use? How to thine ear Unfold the rest? Forced by thy guards from hence, E'en from the palace of her ancestors, With daring violence; she follow'd them, Nor utter'd one reproach accusing thee. No fear expressing, no affected pride, Upon her brow was majesty pourtray'd Blended with meekness. Innocence most pure, And modesty which every heart engaged, Within her eyes sat throned, and darted forth The beams her conscious soul supplied. Around her A brighter lustre her misfortunes cast, And heighten'd every charm. Priests, Hebrews, all, With hands upraised, with tears and loud laments Conjured the soldiers on their heads to turn The slaughtering steel, with horrid cries conjured them. Yet mid their wild extremity of woe While every eye wept Mariamne's fate, Thee too they mourn'd; a sentence they exclaim'd, So cruel, would consume thy life with grief, And overwhelm thee with remorse eternal. HEROD. Immortal power! How every word inflicts A dreadful wound! NARBAS. She felt for their distress, And as she past along spake comfort to them. At length upon the fatal scaffold placed, Lifting her hands opprest with shameful chains, âCruel (she said) and most ill-fortuned Herod! âThy Mariamne on the verge of life âWeeps thee alone. Oh! Be this act the last âOf thy injustice! Live and reign hereafter âWith happier auspices! With eye more mild âBehold my people, look upon my children! âGive them thy loveâwhich blessing to obtain, âI would with transport die.â Serene she spake In conscious innocence, then downward bent That lovely face, whose modest charms so oft Had caught the eye of wonder. I beheld The parricidal steel uplifted high I saw it fallâ HEROD. Dead! Dead, my Mariamne! And do I still survive! O sacred Manes! Dear shade of her, whom I must still adore! Bloody and pale remains of beauty's rare And perfect masterpiece! I come, I come, I follow thee, at least, my Mariamne, And rush into the darkness of the tomb. Why am I thus restrain'd? Perfidious subjects! Hah! Dare ye from my hands intent on death, To wrest my sword? Most loved! Most injured! Thee, Thee I invoke! Now armed with vengeance come! Pour all thy wrath upon me! Tear this heart, Which yet feels warm thy glowing image there. Oh, welcome death! [He faints. NARBAS. His senses fail; he sinks Under the vast affliction. HEROD. What dire clouds Thus gather thick o'er my benighted soul? Gloomy and black grim Melancholy sits, And weighs my senses down. Why am I left, Abandon'd to those agonies of woe Which rack my frame? My eyes dart round in vain No sister I behold; no Mariamne. Do you then weep? And dare you not approach me? Hapless Jerusalem, dost thou avoid The presence of thy king! What have I done? Why am I thus the horror of mankind? Who from this gulph of my calamity Will guide me forth to day? Whose lenient hand Shall softly touch, and heal the festering wound Of long-protracted anguish? Call her hither; Lead Mariamne to me. NARBAS. Mariamne, My lord! HEROD. Aye Mariamne; well I know The sight of her will with a happy calm Soothe each perturbed passion; When she casts, (She whom I love and fear) her glance on me, My heart feels lighter, and my hours flow on More gratefully serene. Her very name Already hath appeased the rage of grief; And beams of comfort gild the shades of woe. Let her approach. NARBAS. My lordâ HEROD. I will behold her. NARBAS. Hast thou, alas! forgot that she's no more? HEROD. What dost thou say, barbarian! NARBAS. His ideas. Swerve from their wonted course, by his misfortunes Rapt from himself. HEROD. Hah! Mariamne dead! Oh, reason, why break forth thy dreadful rays? O conscious light, most sad, replete with horror, Wherefore hast thou again usurp'd my soul? Detested place, yet smoaking with the streams Of her pure blood! Ye walls which I have rear'd! And thou extensive palace, sink in dust! With the vast ruins of thy haughty towers O'erwhelm the spot where Mariamne fell, Untimely fell!âHah! Mariamne dead! And I her murderer! Awake revenge! Tear this vile monster gorg'd with human gore! Ye subjects who have lost her, 'gainst my life Arm, arm, transfix me with a thousand wounds! Thou heaven, where now she dwells, thy thunders send Prone down, and crush me with the flaming bolt! END of the FIFTH and last ACT.</field>
