      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Since Prose has met such bad Success of late, In Verse our Author tries this Night his Fate; A Novice Bard; yet vain enough to hope For no worse Luck, than T?r, and Pope. No far-fetch'd Mummies on this Stage appear, Nor Snake, nor Shark, nor Crocodile is here; But, One Strange Monster we design to show, (His Fellow you ne'er saw in Randal in Channel-Row, the famous Monster-monger. Channel-Row) On whom Dame Nature nothing good bestow'd, In Form, a Monkey; but for Spite, a Toad. Nor thought we fit, (since They might take it ill) To leave out here his Brethren of the Quill; The Northern Doctor with his Highland Face; Nor t'other Wit that waited on her D?ss of M?h. Grace. The Poet begs the Rhyme you will excuse, Nor damn the Labour of your Champion Muse: (A Muse that rises in the Town's Defence, Plagu'd with dull Satire, and Impertinence.) This he declares, The Scenes are all his Own, If for his Faults that Frankness will attone. Let Brother Wits impose on Johnny Gay; But Joe's no Father for Another's Play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. MEN. Mr. Pope. Dr. Arbuthnott. Mr. Gay. Mr. Cibber. Mr. Lintott. WOMEN. Mrs. Oldfield. Mrs. Bicknell. Attendants. Scene Covent Garden.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. A Room in the Rose-Tavern, near the Play-House. Pope solus. [Arb. list'ning at the Door. Thus in the Zenith of my Vogue I Reign, And bless th'Abundance of my fertile Vein; My pointed Satire aim alike at All, (Foe to Mankind) and scatter round my Gall: With poyson'd Quill, I keep the World in Awe, And from My Self my own A Character in Homer, of an Ill-natur'd, Diform'd Villain; which Mr. Pope has thus Translated: Aw'd by no Shame, by no Respect controul'd, In Scandal busie, in Reproaches bold: Spleen to Mankind his Envious Heart possest, And much he hated All, but most the Best. Thersites draw. This very Night, with Modern Strokes of Wit, I charm the Boxes, and divert the Pit; Safe from the Cudgel, stand secure of Praise; Mine is the Credit, be the Because he Father'd the Play, and has since stood Mr. Cibber's Drub for it. Danger Gay's. [Arb. coming forward. Hold, Brother! thou forget'st the Scenes I made; This Boast of thine, is but a Gasconade: Such vain Ambition let thy Friend controul, Nor suffer Pride so far to swell thy Soul; Then have not I to Praise an equal Claim? And is not Arbuthnott as Great a Name? P. Since then so slyly thou hast lent an Ear, Whilst I, deep musing, thought no Creature near; Know, Caledonian, Thine's a simple Part, Scarce any thing but some See the Play; especially Fossile's Part. Quack-Terms of Art, Hard Words, and Quibbles; but 'tis I that sting, And on the Stage The Mummy and Crocodile. th'Ãgyptian Lovers bring; Several Characters in the Play.Miss PhÅbe, Plotwell, Townley, all are Mine, And Sir Tremendous:âFossile's only Thine: Compare not then with me, vain-boasting Fool! I'll write a Poem, e'er thou'lt give a Stool. Ar. Urge not my Wrath too far, presumptuous Loon! For at a Wrong, we Scotchmen kindle soon: My The Doctor was of that University. Glascow Muse to yield to thine disdains, And can write Poems with as little Pains. Defects thou dost observe in Human-kind; But to Thy Own, art, like thy Homer, blind. P. Go, Doctor, go; thy Patients Pulses feel, Handle the Syringe, or in Purges deal: The Muses dwell not in thy Northern Air; And Poetry's an Itch not catching there. But cease; for should I give my Choler vent, Thou might'st thy Rashness, but too late, repent: In my keen Satires handed thro' the Town, With Shame and Madness, hang thy self, or drown. Not Button's Wits from my Lampoons are free, And Thou, and Blackmore are but He ridicul'd the Wits of Button's, in a Satire call'd The Worms. Worms to me. Ar. Such Arrogance, ye Gods! what Man can bear? Laying his Hand on his Sword.I couldâbut ah! thou art not worth my Care. This, by thy Death, would gain but small Renown: Yet from yon Casement will I sling thee down, Beat out thy Brains, and give Old Nick his Due, Unless for Pardon thou dost quickly sue: Vain Pigmy! thou might'st prove, without a Joke, The Ãsop had his Neck broke. Vid. His Life. Second Ãsop then, whose Neck was broke. [Pope aside. I'll sooth his Rage; his Cheek with Anger glows; Th'Odds are against me, should we come to Blows. To Ar.] I was to blame; forgive me, gentle Scot, Why should Pope differ with his Arbuthnott? Thoughtful and anxious for our first Essay, I lost my Reason, and took Thee for Gay. Ar. Then let's embrace; for I have often try'd That Lunaticks and Wits are near ally'd. But say, What News? Our Fate I long to hear; Tho' for the Play, there's little room to fear. P. 'Tis Nine of the Clock. now the Hour, if my Watch says right, When weary'd Actors bid their Friends Good-night. Hark! by the Noise, the Drama should be done, The Coaches rattle, and the Footmen run. See! yonder Johnny comes with eager Pace! Ar. I wish his Looks portend us no Disgrace. Enter Gay. P. Johnny, what News? G. My Grief scarce lets me tell! But you may guess that Matters don't go well. Ar. Is the Play damn'd? They could not be so dull! G. 'Tis Fact, Messieurs! and yet the House was full! If you're such Scepticks, and the Truth would know, To Mrs. Oldfield, or to Cibber go. P. Death to my Hopes! Ar. Come, let us hear the worst; Of Wits ill-fated, we are not the first. G. Betimes, the better to conceal my Face, In th'Eighteen-Penny Row I chose a Place; Whence, unobserv'd, I might attend the Play, And the loud Criticks of the Pit survey. So vast a Throng took up the spacious Round, Scarce for a Mouse, or [To Pope. You, had Room been found; Heroes and Templers here were mix'd with Wits, There Bawds and Strumpets, with a Group of Cits: Rang'd in each Box were seen th'Angelick Fair, Whose Footmen had since Two been posted there. Round me I gaz'd with Wonder and Delight, And wish'd that this had been the Poet's Night. Ar. It promis'd well. G. It did; but mark the End: What boots a Croud, unless that Croud's your Friend? The Prologue finish'd, in the Fossile. Doctor came, And with him, Hand in Hand, Mrs. Townley. th'intriguing Dame. Silent a while th'attentive Many sate, The Men were hush'd, the Women ceas'd their Chat: But soon a Murmur in the Pit began, And thence all round the Theatre it ran; The Noise increasing as along it mov'd, Grew loud at last, and to a Hiss improv'd. Nor Wit, nor Humour, could their Rage appease, Clinket and Plotwell strove in vain to please; Each smutty Phrase, and ev'ry cutting Line, Was thrown away, and lost, like Pearls on Swine: Some Females only (to the good old Cause True Friends, I A Word much us'd by Mr. Gay, in his Shepherd's Week. ween) gave Tokens of Applause. Mean while, conceal'd, I sweating sate, as when In Bagnio stew'd; and thought Three Hours Ten; In greater Pain than Wight besieg'd by Duns, Or trembling Soldier, who the Gantlet runs. P. Then I'll henceforth shake Hands with Wit and Sense, And The Court Ballad was writ immediately after. Ballad-Writer from this Date commence. Ar. Henceforth my Paper I'll reserve for Bills, And in my Labours wrap my Gilded Pills! P. Have I for this, ye Gods! for this, been crown'd So Young with Lawrel, and so long Renown'd? Made Lords and Ladies to my His Homer. Works subscribe, Now to be damn'd by such a noisy Tribe? Ar. Have I for this almost renounc'd my Art, And of my Patients lost the greatest Part? Better I had turn'd Quack, and kept a Stage, Than toil'd and writ for such a senseless Age! P. But hold; we must not thus our Hopes give o'er, The fam'd The First Time the Rehearsal was Acted, it was hiss'd. Rehearsal had this Fate before: Experience tells, 'tis not a Thing so New, For most to damn what's understood by few; Those who dislik'd our Crocodile and Mumm, In Two Nights more may to their Relish come: Mean while from sinking to preserve our Play, To It is well known they did so. pack an Audience is the surest way; For this Performance Patrons must be sought; Let these but clap, their Seats shall cost them nought; The rest, asham'd to hiss, will change their Noise: So Ducks in Ponds are taken by Decoys. G. To find out Patrons asks no mighty Pain: Not far from hence, there is a noted Lane, Where Darby Captains ev'ry Night abound, For Want of Valour, and of Pence renown'd: These I'll engage; and that they may not fail, Bribe them with Mutton-Chops, and Pots of Ale. P. To Morrow to the Park my Course I steer, Where good Duke Humphry's Guests dine half the Year, If there are Charms in Pudding, Beef, and Wine, Fear not; that famish'd Crew shall rival Thine. Ar. Your sev'ral Methods, Brethren, I commend; At such a Pinch, what's matter who's our Friend? With Tarts and Cheese-cakes to the Schools I'll run, Secure some Boys; and then the Thing is done. P. Haste then, dear Gay, my other Heart's Delight, Make sure your Sharpers for to Morrow Night: But first to Oldfield, and to Bicknel go, And give our Service, Having been formerly us'd to such Errands. as full well you know; Smoke how the Multitude's Contempt they bear, Asswage their Anger, and appease the Fair; Whilst at Friend Mr. Lintott's House in Fleet-street. Bernard's we our Doom console, And drown our Sorrows in a cheerful Bowl. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. The Green Room at the Play-House. Mrs. OLDFIELD. BICKNEL. Oldf. Bicknel, it is resolv'd; thy Arts give o'er; For from this Night, I tread the Stage no more: Hiss'd and insulted!âNever, by my Soul, I tread it more! I'd sooner go and stroll. B. Do not, good Sister, thus your Friends forsake, For if you leave our House, we all shall break: This Theatre will dwindle ev'ry Day, And scarce our Profits for the Candles pay. Avert, ye Gods! such Fate from Drury-Lane: For to keep Wilks we then should strive in vain; Malicious Master of the other Play-House. Rich would in our Loss delight, And 'twould be Nuts to Rogers and to Knight. O. In Market fam'd for Hay, a House full high, With Sashes bright, and Wainscot Rooms have I; Rich Beds, and Damask Chairs (I thank my Stars!) And Cabinets are there with China Jars. What hinders then, but I enjoy my Store, As famous Bracegirdle has done before? (Mock'd by Spectators, and by Poets crost) And quit the Scenes where all my Glory's lost? B. Believe thy Bicknel, who thy Grief partakes, So small a Slur, too great Impression makes: I too was hiss'd, whom oft the self-same Crowd Has seen with Raptures Dance, and clapt so loud; Yet I'll act on, nor mind this Night's Disgrace, And, spight of Criticks, dare to show my Face. Oldf. Ill-judging Beauties (tho' of high Degree) Why did you force this wretched Part on me? And Thou, Lady M?n. fat Baroness, with Cheeks so Red, Whence came this Maggot in thy ancient Head? Oh! that I had (with Booth and Wilks combin'd) Obdurate as at first, not chang'd my Mind! Or, since I could not from the Task be freed, Had mimick'd Lady M?n, not Mrs. M?d. B. Who'd rage and fret to hear a Rabble hiss, Or take the Frowns of those The Gentlemen of the Army. Cockards amiss? For the Beau Monde contemns the roaring Boys, And never joins with their infernal Noise. Besides, O think, in thy full Beauty's Pride, What Pity 'twere, a Form like Thine to hide: Of Kings and Heroes I have often read, Who, sick of Worldly Pomp, to Cells have fled; But, one Example on the Stage produce, When Actress in her Prime, e'er turn'd Recluse. O. How frail is Woman! and how quickly breaks The firm Resolves, and solemn Vows she makes! At thy Persuasion, Girl, I will not quit, Tho' us'd so ill by Galleries and Pit: But if to serve that Envious Mr. Pope. Urchin's Spight, I stand the Brunt of such another Night, May Oldfield be the Sport of Grubstreet Bards, At Ombre always lose, and curse the Cards. B. What if a Present then should tempt your Mind? (To Presents few are Proof of Womankind:) Should the Three Poets raise a pretty Sum, And with full Purse, in humble Manner come; If on the Store you chanc'd to cast your Eye, O cou'd you, cou'd you Then, their Suit deny? O. In Gold there's wond'rous Eloquence, I grant; Gold can break Prisons, and debauch a Saint; Make stubborn Hearts against the Grain comply; Since nothing's Proof to't then, ah! how should I? But hark! who's entring here? I'll run away; For by the clumsie Tread it should be Gay. That, manage You, and bring them to our Lure, For me a Present, and your self secure; Else tell him, we are from our Promise freed; There's nothing to be done, unless they bleed. [Ex. Oldfield. Enter Gay. B. to Oldf.] Trust to my Art. G. At both my Friends Request, I come, fair Bicknel, e'er you go to Rest. B. For what, good Sir? G. To give our Thanks, tho' poor, For that kind Part which in our Play you bore. B. Indeed! G. Ne'er trust me else. B. 'Tis wond'rous civil; But would your Friends and you were at the Devil. G. How, Madam! B. Nay, 'tis Truth; you need not stare! My Sister Oldfield will the same declare. I'll warrant now, you wonder why we fret, Nor know the Treatment which this Night we met. G. Your Pardon, Fair One; yes, indeed, I know Th'ungentle Mob was somewhat Rude, or so: Is't That you mean? B. And is that nothing, pray? To morrow Night let who will act your Play. For she your Townley, and your Clinket I, (Thanks to our Stars!) have other Fish to fry. [Going. G. Holding her.] Hold, Madam, hold! you'll have Regard, I hope, If not to me, to Arbuthnott and Pope, Those mighty Names! B. Why, what are they to me? Once more, I say, Old Nick take all the Three. Unhand me, Fool! G. O smooth those angry Brows! Prevail on Oldfield, and our Cause espouse; 'Twere pity Three such Wits at once should break, Our Honour, Fame, and Fortunes are at Stake. B. Then, let me tell you, If you break you may, Three Fools well met; Pope, Arbuthnott, and Gay! To save your Bacon we are not inclin'd, Unless to win us some Device you find. G. musing] Let's thinkâIn Pastoral I'll make you speak, And bring you both into my Shepherd's Week. For you the Swains each other shall defy, And Two of his Shepherds. Hobbinol and Clout their Sinews try. B. 'Twon't do. G. If you have Male or Female Foes, These Mr. Pope. Sawney shall lampoon, I'll challenge Those. B. Our Quarrels to revenge, nor him to write, Nor want we, valiant Sir, your self to fight. G. The Dr. Arbuthnott. Northern Poet shall your Doctor be, Cure all your Pains, and never take a Fee; With skilful Hand, shall save, whene'er you wed, The Midwife's Charge, and bring you both to Bed. B. Nay, if you're sawcy, look, there lies the Door; Begone, rash Clown, and see my Face no more. [Going. G. O name the Charm, and do not, do not go! B. Then, to deal frankly, there's but one I know. G. What can that be? B. What? Are you then so dull! With so much Wit, has Gay so thick a Scull? I'll speak plain English then; We must be bought; If hiss'd we are, we'll not be hiss'd for nought: With far less Risque, and likelier much to pass, She can act Jane Shore, a Part Mrs. Oldfield performs excellently. Shore, or I, the Another Part Mrs. Bicknel is famous for. Northern Lass. Something on The Maid that carries Clinket's Desk. Willis too were well bestow'd, Or she'll not break her Back with such a Load; The Desk to carry once for her's enough; And so it is for us to speak your Stuff. Unless those Arts you try, all else will fail; And Guineas, Guineas only, can prevail. [Ex. Bicknel. Gay solus. There croakt a Raven in that dismal Voice: What to resolve on now? 'Tis Hobson's Choice. Severe Decree! These Women sure are Jews! How will my Friends receive the dismal News? With them how Matters stand, I partly know, And sure I am, with me that Stock is low. O that, contented with my Servile State, See the Key to Three Hours, &amp;c.At some Bufet I still had held a Plate! Or, not attempting Things beyond my Reach, Mr. Gay's History.With Honest Aaron Hill improv'd the Beech! Well! to the Wits at Bernard's strait I'll run; Unless He helps, by G?, we're all undone.

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. Lintott's House. ARB. POPE, CIBBER, LINTOTT. Cib. Well, Gentlemen, since I'm uncas'd and free, In Pasteboard you'll no more imprison me. You may your Fossile make of Honest Mr. Johnson. Ben, And turn my Mr. Penkethman. Rival to a Beast again: But I'll no Mummy be, to make you laugh; Nor shall you catch Old Birds, like Coll, with Chaff. In twice Ten Years that I the Stage have trod, I've worn a Thousand Habits wond'rous odd; Still, Proteus-like, in some New Form appear'd, But never in my Life was yet so jeer'd: With See the Scene between Mummy, Crocodile, and Townley Hieroglyphicks on my Back and Breast Embroider'd o'er! why, sure you were possest. In former Ages, no such motly Piece, Was known to Antient Italy or Greece: Here bawdy Prose, and there of Verse a Scrap; How could you dream the Company would clap? Herodotus, and many other Accounts of Ãgypt.Such Monsters breeds your Nile (the Learned say) One Half is Frog, and t'other Half is Clay. Ar. Be not, good Cibber, on your Friends so smart The Drama was compos'd with wond'rous Art: The Author's not in fault, for all your haste; The Play was damn'd; but the Town's want or Taste Twice more to Act, O do not then refuse! See, in the Key, what a Property they make of Cibber.And some small Freedoms with your self excuse. C. Those Freedoms I'd forgive, if mixt with Sense, And pass a Jest, tho' at my own Expence; But stupid Satire, who alive can bear, That writes himself, or does Toledo wear? Urge me no more; against the Stream you drive; My A Farce of Mr. Cibber's. Bulls and Bears I would as soon revive. P. If I remember well, this many a Day, Thou, Colly, on the Stocks hast had a Play: Come, let thy Talent lye no longer hid, I'll to Perfection bring A French Tragedy of Corneille's, Translated by Mr. Cibber. Vide Key. the mighty Cid: So shall thy Fame increase, and eke thy Store, Altho' thy Scenes have been condemn'd before. In Buskins I'll equip thy Tragick Muse, And Shakespear shall himself his Credit lose: For these damn'd Criticks, we'll not care a Rush, And make ev'n Two Excellent Tragedies of Mr. Rowe's, and Mr. Addison's. Tamerlane, and Two Excellent Tragedies of Mr. Rowe's, and Mr. Addison's. Cato blush. C. aside.] Pernicious Tempter! what a Bait is there! Shall Colly then once more the Buskin wear? What stubborn Mind such Proffers can resist? And at that Price, who would not dare be hiss'd? To Pope.] The Cid indeed I ventur'd to Translate, But for my Hero, fear'd Perolla and Izadora. A Tragedy by Mr. Cibber. Perolla's Fate: Then since this Matter thou hast mov'd to me, Thou shalt for once my Supervisor be; For, Alexander, if I know thee right, Thou hast of late mistook thy Talent quite: A Giant often proves a rank Pultroon, And ev'ry Pigmy is not born Buffoon: Yet who can tell, altho' thy Farce is vile, How Folks may like thy Tragick Stile; from Sophocles, the Greek Tragedian. Sophoclean Stile? P. 'Twas I that made the Agamemnon. King of Men to speak Far better in our Tongue, than Homer's Greek; And taught the Achilles. Pelian Chief to rant and swear In English, with a much more Martial Air: O doubt not then, if thou our Friend wilt be, But I'll do Justice to Corneille and Thee, And e'er it's long, on some auspicious Night, Thy A Dutch Phrase, for a Child in the Mother's Belly. Hans en Kelder Poem bring to light. C. I yield, I yield, my stubborn Heart's o'ercome, No longer Proof to such a Sugar-plumb. In See the Scene of Mummy and Crocodile. Swadling-Clouts once more I'll stand the Shock, And Rival for your sakes my Brother Croc; Tho' ev'ry Critick could out-hiss a Snake, And louder Noise than See Milton's Paradise Lost. Milton's Devils make. Lint. Good Mr. Cibber, if it be no Crime, Let me your Copy pray bespeak in Time: And if you crowd among your Tragick Stile, A little Humour, that will make one smile, (I found that Want, in Mr. Lintott dislik'd PhÃ¦dra for want of Humour. PhÃ¦dra once before) No Brother of the Press shall give you more: For who in Places famous for Printers. Fleetstreet, or in Places famous for Printers. Warwick Lane, Rewards like me, the Labours of the Brain? C. I thank thee, Bernard, that's a Point of weight, Which, if I thrive, we'll argue tÃªte Ã  tÃªte. [To Pope and Arb. Mean while, I'll serve your Cause the best I can, And keep my Brethren steady to a Man. [Exit Cibber. P. Damn'd Blockhead! not to see so plain a Bite! I mend his Play!âI will as soon go fight: 'Tis good, however, to amuse, him thus, And make the Fool believe he's one of Us; To help our Purpose, let him do his best, By G?, I'll serve him as I serv'd the rest. Ah! here comes Brother Gay! Enter Gay. Arb. As pale as Death; Sweating big Drops, and almost out of Breath! P. The Matter? I'm in Pain! A. I long to hear! G. Nay, we're undone, the Case, my Friends, is clear; Worse Tidings now I bring you than before; Oldfield and Bicknel vow they'll act no more. A. Can this be true? G. True, as my Name is Gay, Unless you bleed, and for the Favour pay. P. Damn'd mercenary Jilts! A. I would bestow, If that might serve, a Pair of Gloves, or so. G. That Bounty, Sir, I fear, will not succeed; Of Guineas, not of Gloves, they stand in need. P. as going] I'll go my self, and bring the Gipsies over G. You may your Namesake bring as soon to Dover What Man could speak, was by your Johnny spoke But all he said, alas! was turn'd to Joke. Bicknel, that Devil! for the rest were fled, Pronounc'd the dreadful Words, and struck me dead. Lintott aside.] 'Tis said, he paid Fifty Guineas for it.I've bought their Copy! How my Heart does ake! Pity, ye Gods! if he says true, I break! P. What's to be done? G. I, for my part, am poor, Have clear'd my Lodgings, and my Ale-house Score. A. Next Spring I take at Glascow my Degrees, And for this Twelve-month past, have had no Fees. Pope aside to Gay, and Arb.] Ah! had that cursed Homer sold but well, I might have squeez'd from Him a little Spell. There's nothing for't but that; and yet I'll try: Bernard, 'tis You that must the Purse unty. L. I'll tye a Rope about my Neck as soon; No, Gentlemen, 'tis not with me full Moon. G. But Forty Pieces; 'tis a Sum so small, The Poet's Night will make Amends for all. A. Do, gentle Bernard, 'tis a Bagatelle. L. Zoons! why the Play will neither Act, nor Sell. P. Ungrateful Man! Several Poems of Mr. Pope's. Fame's Temple, call to mind, My Several Poems of Mr. Pope's. Forest, Several Poems of Mr. Pope's. Rape, and Satires on Mankind; Think, how by These thou hast increas'd thy Store. L. Look on your Homer, there, behind the Door. Thou little dream'st what Crowds I daily see, That call for He Translated the First Book of the Iliad. Tickell, and that spurn at Thee! Neglected there, your Prince of Poets lyes, By Dennis justly damn'd, Dennis's Remarks upon Pope's Homer. and kept for Pyes. Alas! his Outside I enrich in vain, And by the Gilding, Custom hope to gain: With some dull Fop, perhaps, the Book may pass, And help to make a Show in Case of Glass. But your fam'd Heroes, with their warlike Bands, Grace the same Shelf where Ogilby now stands, And rot on mine, or on Subscribers Hands. Ar. Is Bernard grown so hard then, to be struck? Sure some See Mr. Cobb's Tripos. It was not thought improper to make the Poet pun here; he having done it in the Play. She-Wolf, or Tygress gave thee suck! P. Sure thou wert born, O Man renown'd for Print, In See Mr. Cobb's Tripos. It was not thought improper to make the Poet pun here; he having done it in the Play. Stratford-Stony, or in Shire of Flint!

Gotham Sage: You may with Curll your Quarrel now repent, Or else to him you might for Help have sent: But he with Ballads will debauch the Town, And cloud your small Remainder of Renown.

T?r, whom you call Senseless Drone, Trusts to your Comedy, to save his own. Enter Boy, with a Footman. Boy. This Footman wants to speak with Mr. Pope. P. Bid him advance: Some kind Relief, I hope. Who come you from? Footm. Three Ladies known full well; Their Names are See The Court Ballad. G?n, B?ne, L?p?l; This Purse of Gold, and Letter, Sir, they send. [Gives them. P. O my good Stars!âPray wait a little, Friend. Reads.] Sir, Your Wit, by noisy Fools ill understood, We thank you for, and deem it wond'rous good: The turns are fine, the Repartees are smart, And smutty Jests hook'd in with wond'rous Art; Tho' not, indeed, in cleanest Linnen wrapt, They pleas'd our Fancies, and by us were clapp'd. We partly guess'd what's what some time before; But your kind Lessons have improv'd us more: Then pray accept this little Purse of Gold, And let us be among your Friends enroll'd. You, and your Brethren, we'll be glad to see, In Street call'd Gerrard, when we drink our Tea. P. What Harmony sounds here in ev'ry Line! And how these Guineas chink! and how they shine! To the Footman.] Here, Friend, take This; commend me to the Dames, And for this Bounty, So he did in the Court Ballad presently after. I'll record their Names. [Exit Man. To Lintott.] Lintott, henceforth you print my Works no more. L. Command me, Sir, my Wife, and all my Store! Forgive your Bernard, and you ne'er shall want Wine, Guineas, nor Tit-bits most Elegant: Nay, to my Suit a pitying Ear incline, I'll put your Head up, and take down my Sign.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Congratulatory POEM; Inscribed to Mr. Gay, on his Valour and Success behind Drury-Lane Scenes. I sing the Man who bravely shows His Courage 'gainst a Host of Foes! So full of Fury, he'll resent What ne'er for Injury was meant. We oft have read in Ancient Story, Of Heroes, who would fight for Glory; Their Fortune try in Bloody Field, And rather chuse to dye than yield: But never heard of Poetaster, By Courage brought into Disaster. But now our Modern Bards can fight As Bravely, as they Wisely write, And dare, to show that they're stout-hearted, Draw Sword, when certain to be parted. But Johnny Gay's the Bravest Mind; He War proclaims 'gainst all Mankind, And does to his Assistance call Little wise Pope, the Devil and all. As when a Lame Man, and a Blind, To Beg together are inclin'd, The one, the other's Want supplies; This finds the Legs, and That the Eyes: So these our worthy Bards accord, Pope finds the Pen, and Gay the Sword; And may for Satire, and for Courage, B' esteem'd the Champions of our Age. 'Tis true, they had a damn'd Miscarriage, In their Three Hours After Marriage. When kindly thinking to delight us, They brought on Monsters, to affright us, Wonders from Ãgypt, and from Nile, A Mummy, and a Crocodile. Th'expecting Audience had hope, Amidst the Monsters to've seen Pope: So good a Jest how could they 'scape, The Town would-think't some merry Ape, Dress'd up in Masquerading Show, To represent an awkard Beau. Some People think most Popes are Evil: But all agree, this Pope's the Devil. Then, Gay, be kind, and cease to teize; Forbear to Write, or learn to Please. FINIS.</field>
