      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —A Pass in the Mountains near Messina. Enter Guiscardo and Stephano. Guis. His words were fire—both light and heat! At once With zeal, they warm'd us; and convinced, with reason. I had read and heard of eloquence before; How 'tis despotic, takes the heart by storm— Whate'er the ramparts, prejudice, or use Environ it withal—how, 'fore its march, Stony resolves have given way like flax, How it can raise, or lay, the mighty surge Of popular commotion, as the wind, The wave that frets the sea;—but till to-day, I never proved its power. When he began, A thousand hearers prick'd their ears to list, With each a different heart; when he left off, Each man could tell his neighbour's by his own. Steph. Is't John of Procida? Guis. So rumour says. Who else? The constant'st friend of Sicily— The friend that loves, yet suffers for his love. Heard'st ever lips before, with power like his? A holy man, and brigand, near me stood, Wedged by the press together; churlishly They first endured their compell'd neighbourhood, And shrank from contact, they would fain escape. The one with terror; and with scorn, the other, Who blazed with life and passion, like a torch Beside a taper;—such the man of prayer Appear'd, in contrast with the freebooter. But lo! the change! soon as the orator That universal chord, with master skill, Essay'd—the love of country—Like two springs, Ravines apart, whose waters blend at last In some sweet valley; leaning cheek to cheek, Attracted by resistless sympathy, Their tears together ran, one goodly river! Hark! the dispersing crowd, taking their leave From the last hill-tops. Let us join them. [They cheer. Steph. Hither Come Andrea and John of Procida. Let's on, my friend, nor interrupt their converse, For it seems deep, and earnest. Guis. Have with you. I would Fernando had been here, that friend I scarce can boast, yet can't refrain from loving. If there be latent virtue in his blood, Like what endears the land that gives us birth, Such heart enforcement sure had call'd it forth! [They go out. Enter Procida, disguised as a Cordelier, and Andrea. And. You move my wonder, past the speaking on't. I never dream'd, in such extremity, Such hope could be so near! Pro. 'Tis in the crisis The fever does or dies. Our friends abroad Are warm, and not a few; the fleet, you see In the offing, and suppose the Pope's, is ours; At home, Sicilians are as one single man, Their thoughts, their feelings, their resolves, the same. In this disguise, each quarter of the isle Where man hath habitation, house, or cave, I have visited; and tuned the minds of all To the same temper and the selfsame aim, Vengeance and liberty! Before a week The hordes of France shall dwindle to the man Whose execution ends them. And. Retribution Indeed! Pro. Yes; sweeping and definitive. Thou seem'st to lower at it. Hast any part In France? Dost owe her kindliness or ruth?— Thy tyranny that Sicily weeps, daily, With blood!—her children's scourge, as testify Murder and rapine, that unblushingly Enact their parts in open day, and lust, With quite as little shame! I know that men Will turn to tigers in a storméd town That's yielded them to sack; but Syracuse, Palermo, and Messina, stood no siege; And yet were they sack'd, and still the game goes on, And in cold blood! What weighs upon thy heart? Or what can weigh when thy dear native land Is nigh to throw her grievous burden off? And. 'Twas not with heed for France my visage fell, But thee. Pro. But me! For what? And. Those who devote themselves To virtuous causes, where bad men prevail, And breed contamination, have at times A hard and most ungracious part to play, When those, they love, behoves they mark to suffer. Pro. Whom do I mark to suffer, yet do love? I have no kindred, have I? If I have, It must be only in that far degree Where distance genders strangeness. And. Hadst thou not A son? Pro. Thou know'st I had! Thou know'st he's dead! The infant perish'd in the sacking of My castle.—So it was affirm'd by one Who brought the horrid tale—Is he alive? And. Be patient! You remember, do you not, When he was four years old, or thereabouts— You told me his age, for he was then a boy, Might pass for six, and so I rated him, He was so fine a child—you recollect At e'en that tender age a hard excrescence, And something like a wart, but larger, which Like threatening mischief had begun to grow; At thy request, I from his fore-arm cut. 'Twas rooted deep; as deep of course the wound, And, answering to the knife, of crucial form! Pro. I recollect it! Is the boy alive? And. Listen! 'Twas here I cut it from his arm. 'Tis true another might have such a cause For surgery in even such a place, And such a scar the remedy might leave; Though to my own hand I could safely swear. Pro. Hast seen the mark on any one? And. I pray you Hear what I have to tell, then draw yourself The inference. Pro. O Heaven! I have a son, And he's in jeopardy, and I the cause! And. Remember you one Angelo Martini? Pro. Master-of-arms? And. The same; I went to see The practice at his school. One—a young man Of most commanding person, and of 'haviour To win all hearts—took up the foil to play, And baring his right arm for freer use— Pro. You saw the mark! You saw the scar! And. I did. The very cicatrix my knife had left. Pro. I have not heard news of late—and such as this Comes somewhat suddenly. Is he a man Of honour? And. I would think him so. Pro. Would think? Nay, then, I see what he is! And. Indeed, my friend, I cannot say he is, nor yet, is not. Pro. You say he stands in danger, and from me. 'Tis clear as day—I comprehend it all! He takes the part of France! His heart is French! What Sicily gave to him he gives to France, The curse of Sicily! And if a sword Light on his head for that, who'll blame the smiter? Not his own father?—Where abideth he? And. In Messina, with the governor. Pro. Perdition! Scarce is the worst told, ere worse follows it! The governor! And. Nay, John of Procida, Command thyself! Pro. Couldst thou, if thou wast I? Didst question him about that scar? Perhaps 'Tis not my son! O Heaven! in what a strait A father may be put. I wish'd him dead Just now. I own I did. Didst speak to him About that mark? And. No—there were standers-by. Pro. You follow'd him out? And. No. Pro. No! And. One beckon'd me Apart, and held mine ear; and when I turn'd To look for him, I miss'd him. He had gone. Pro. You have seen him since, and spoken with him! And. No: I have craved an audience, but was out of time. Pro. Indeed? A mighty man! You should have thrust All let aside, and walk'd into his chamber, And told him who you were—and what he was! And. Nay, you forget I was a stranger to him. Pro. Nay, you forgot you were his father's friend, And by that title had a right to see him At any place, at any hour o' the day. Whom does he pass for? And. Not thy son. Pro. That's right! I am very glad of that! And. All I could learn Was this;—that in the sacking of thy castle Your son alone escaped, a little child. The governor adopted him, and gave him The liberal training of a cavalier, Favour on kindness grew, and love on favour, And e'en to-day the governor bestows His only daughter on him. Pro. Pestilence Spring from their union if they wed! And. My friend! Pro. When is the ceremony? And. I have said To-day. Pro. The hour—I mean the very hour. And. At twelve. Pro. Let the world end ere it takes place! It must be stopp'd! And. And who shall stop it? Pro. I! Straight to Messina. Come! The shortest way! [They go out. SCENE II. —A Street in Messina. Enter Stephano, Thomaso, Carlo. Carlo. No mischief come, last night, to any friends Of yours? Steph. None, sir, that I have heard. Carlo. No throat In frolic cut? No gamesome robbery? No courtesy on wife or daughter forced Of any that you know? Steph. None. Carlo. Luckless man! My brother was compell'd keep open shop After the hour of shutting—customers So hot, there's not a shelf he has but gapes For new replenishing—and that took place Not half a month before. No pleasant news With you? [To Thomaso. Thom. None yet! Carlo. Take comfort, it will come Before we get to the end of the next street. The Frenchman loves us, sirs; and, like true friend, Will keep our spirits from stagnation, though It be against our wills. 'Tis good for our health! Come on. We'll have news yet, and plenty on't. [Going. Guis. [without, at the opposite side]. Thomaso! Stephano! Stop! Turn! [Enters.] At last You hear me, sirs! I am breath'd with chasing you! Why were you not at home? Thom. Why, what's the matter? Guis. Blood, sirs! Carlo. The news! Guis. News! 'Tis the common cry Of every day! Thom. Yes; but the common'st thing That affects others, has a stranger's face When it comes home to us. Whose blood, Guiscardo? Take breath and tell us. Guis. Are you not akin To Angelo Martini? Thom. and Steph. What of him? Guis. His roof-tree suffer'd shame last night!—His daughter! His only child!—That force could dare assail A temple of such holy chastity! The spoiler of her honour and her life— For with her virgin jewel he purloin'd The witness of the theft—a mangled corse, Cast into the street by Angelo, who came Too late to save, but timely for revenge, Lies 'fore the father's gate, which hounds beset, More monstrous for the human forms they wear, Howling to lap the blood of Angelo; And casting looks of savage purposes On the few friends, that, holding yet aloof, With augmentation might defy their fangs! Have you your weapons? Steph. Yes. Who goes without them That walks through streets of licensed murderers? Guis. Grasp them then! Hie ye straight to Angelo, While to the castle I, in hope to move A friend's good offices to stop the fray, The favourite of the governor—Fernando. And be ye resolute, comes it to more blood! Death's nothing to the fear! There lies the pang, And that we suffer every hour in the day. [They go out severally. SCENE III. —A Chamber in the Castle. Enter Martel and Louis. Martel. What uproar keeps this din without the castle? Louis. I know not, but the town is all astir; Hither and thither fly the citizens. What can it mean? Martel. Here's one will give the cause. Enter Ambrose. Well, Ambrose? Amb. Count de Marlez has been murder'd, And cast into the street! his body hack'd From head to foot. Martel. Who did it? Amb. Angelo Martini. Martel. Was it in a quarrel, or Did he assassinate him? Amb. I know not. This moment come I from before the house Of Angelo Martini, which the friends Of the slain count beset; while, close at hand, Those of Martini wait, as if prepared To take part with the murderer; who, the while, From open casement in the upper floor, With savage looks, holds forth a gory arm, Grasping a blade of the same ghastly hue, And, waving 't o'er the body of his child, Blanch'd milk-white of her blood, and half-exposed, Declares he'll ne'er surrender, save a corse Mangled like his below, Martel. Some love affair! Conquerors will not brook coy mistresses! Louis. This falls out ominously, does it not, Upon the nuptial day? Martel. The nuptial hour! Strange nuptials, sir! It oft has moved my wonder, The Governor, a stern and gloomy man, Should so affect the young Sicilian. Is't love? I have mark'd him oft, with looks that spoke Aught but content, gazing upon Fernando Minutes together; then, with deepest sigh, Break off the scrutiny—for such it seem'd— And turn to moody pondering. His daughter Were better wed, methinks, to one of France Than to a son of Sicily, of blood Unknown, and all unfriended like her bridegroom. Le Clerc [without]. Prevent him! Stop him! Guis. [without]. Nay, I will pass in! Martel. Suffer him, good Le Clerc; I know him. He's Fernando's friend, and comes Doubtless to speak with him. Louis. How wild he looks! Amb. And spectre-like. Guis. [Rushing in, followed by Le Clerc.] Fernando! Sirs! Fernando! Martel. Why, what's amiss? Guis. Don't question me, dear sirs; Fernando! Martel. Here he is. Enter Fernando. Guis. [Catching Fernando by the arm.] Come forth with me! Come!—Angelo Martini!— Fern. [Resisting.] Stop. Guis. Nay, come! Come! Fern. What's the matter? Guis. Read it in my looks, And save the time of telling on't!—or come, And I will tell you as we go along! Come! Fern. Hold! you'll tear my sleeve. Do you not know It is my wedding-day? Guis. Do you not know A man call'd Angelo Martini, and Not that he's in danger? Fern. I infer so. Guis. Thou dost? and art not now upon the way To his house? Thy tutor! Angelo Martini! 'Sdeath, art thou flesh or stone? Offer'st thou not To move! Fern. You'll find it husbandry of time To spend what's needed; else, you save to waste. What of Martini? Guis. Ay!—So!—Is't the way? Ought friends to take it leisurely in straits Where hottest speed is slow for those they love, Lying in jeopardy? Sit down, sir. Well [Seats himself. We sit as stand!—we progress either way As fast! Sit down and listen. Yesternight— Pray you your chair—I cannot well go on Until I see you at your ease. [Fernando sits.]—Last night, As I said, a thief—not such as filches coin— Was the unbidden guest of Angelo; Chamber'd with his fair child, without her leave, As her gored breast can vouch for you; Angelo— I trust my tongue does not outstep your ear? Fern. Go on! Guis. In good time, sir. Well! Angelo Waked by a shriek—'twas not without the house, But came from the quarter where his daughter couch'd— And—taking the strange summons with more heat Of apprehension, than will suffer one, That hath the use of limb, to lie abed, Or sit his chair as we do—to afford The aid was needed, rush'd where he might give it, And at the door encounter'd him who had made him A host without his privity or wish, Dagger in hand, sir, slinking from the bier, Had been, an hour before, the virgin's bed! Fern. What follow'd? Guis. One might guess, a blow!—Yes, sir— While the blood runs 'twill heat or cool upon Occasion. Yes, sir; Angelo, our friend, A generous man, although we say it, like To exact penalty for injury Done to a common friend—and how much more An only child!—struck—nor with naked hand, Nor easily contented! Blow begot Blow, till the body of the Count— Fern. What count? Guis. The Count de Marlez. Fern. Was he stabb'd by Angelo? Guis. And stabb'd till not a palm's breadth of his body But bears the crimson seal that witnesses The glut of ravening vengeance, as it lies In the street, cast forth the casement, of whose sill Angelo makes a bier to show his child To some amaze-confounded lookers on. While the retainers, countrymen, and friends Of the Count assault the gate of Angelo To get at him and tear him limb from limb; The which thy timely presence had prevented. But not enough thou know'st thy friend requires thee; Behoves his need be woven a history; And while the loom's a-going, which I must ply, They massacre the man who taught and loved thee! Fern. Go forth, my friends, and succour Angelo. Take others with you—all the aid you can! Dissuade his enemies from violence. Use the Duke's name! Command them to forbear, And leave rebuke to him. [Martel and others rush out. Guis. Go'st thou not too? Play'st thou the friend by heartless deputy, To foil the foes that work with all their hearts! Keep'st thou the castle when Martini's house Is made the stall of savage butchery? Lend'st him a finger when he wants thy hand, Thy limbs, and body? Fern. 'Tis my wedding-day; The very hour I lead my bride to church. Guis. Thou wast his son to Angelo Martini, And when thy presence would be life to him, And it is ask'd of thee, thou givest it not, But send'st him that of men who would look with coldness, If not with joy, upon Martini's carcass; Because thy nuptials may not be delay'd! Ached thy bride's head, would it not stop them?—or Would they go on, fell the Duke sudden sick? Or chanced to shake Messina with a fit Of the earthquake? or the Cataracts of Ætna Began to play?—But not a pause, although Thou heard'st the life-blood gurgling in the throat Of Angelo Martini! Fare thee well— If well ingratitude fared ever. Mingle thy blood with those, at thought of whom, Wast thou the tithe of a Sicilian, Thy blood would curdle! We were brothers once; One mind—one soul! We now are two—apart! Disjoin'd! Opposed! Never to meet again Except to the woe of the one or t'other of us. [Goes out. Fern. Come back! Fool! Meddler! Braggart! Iso. [Entering.] How is this? What dost thou with thy weapon in thy hand! Ha! by thy looks, it was not without need Thou drewest it! Sweet heaven! I saw thee thus Last night! Fern. Where, dearest? Iso. In my dreams, Fernando; That brought me naught but fearful images! Tumults, where daggers gleam'd and blood ran free Along the kennels of the streets, instead Of its own channels. There, my friend, were you And I in the midst, your one arm circling me, Your other my defence 'gainst horrid men That stood around, a stride or two aloof, Like hounds, awhile at bay, prepared to spring! Ah! then I knew the taste of death—great Heavens! The sickness on't! Yet e'en that sickness still Sweetness, methought, to die along with thee. They struck—you fell! I waked while yet the room Rang with a shriek. Put up thy sword, lest now A prodigy should harrow up my soul, And drops of gore, uncall'd, start on its blade! Is't up? Fern. It is. Iso. 'Tis very strange, Fernando; This is our wedding-day, and yet I feel As though we should not marry. Fern. Wouldst thou, then, Our nuptials should be marr'd? Iso. No!—would you think 'Twas the coy maid of but a week ago That answer'd, now, so promptly? 'Twas not quickly, I learn'd to love you—though, to do you justice, No master ever labour'd more to teach. But now, methinks, I have the lesson better By heart than you have. Fern. Better! Iso. Yes, Fernando! And so you'd find, were you to slight the pupil You took such pains with once. I would not have Our nuptials marr'd,—and, more, they shan't be so, Have I the power to help it. Fern. Isoline— Thy father!— Iso. Well?—Say on; I'd hear thee say't, though all the world were by. Fern. I bless thee for thy bounteous love! Enter Governor. Gov. Come, child! And on my other hand, Fernando, come. The bridal company, in readiness To attend you to the altar, wait for you. [As they are going, Martel and Louis enter hastily. What would you, friends? Martel. A word, sir, with Fernando. Gov. Be brief, then, as you may. [Leading Isoline off. Iso. [Stopping and turning.] Fernando! Fern. Love, A moment and I'm with you! Gov. Isoline! Iso. I come!—the ground appears to hold my steps. [She goes out with the Governor. Fern. Well, friends; were you in time? Martel. To see the house Of Angelo Martini in a blaze; Lit by his own hand, the funereal pyre Of his slain child! Whence, soon as 'twas in flames, Taking advantage of the pause in which Amaze enchain'd his foes, with clotted blade Old Angelo burst forth, a spectacle Of blood-congealing horror, that awhile Deprived of use the members which, except For such a frost, had dealt him fifty deaths. But soon it turn'd to thaw, yet not until Martini's friends surrounded him; and now Along the streets a running fight they keep, Marking an ample, ghastly track, with blood, And here and there a body drain'd of it. Fern. For mercy's sake provide you with a guard And use all pains to stop this hideous fray, And above all to save Martini's life! Fly friends! O spare not speed! Do all you can This fray, untimely, to o'ertake, and stop! [Martel and Louis go out; Fernando following. SCENE IV. —The Outside of a Church. Enter Virgins strewing Flowers after the Bridal Party. CHORUS OF VIRGINS. As now the track with flowers we strew, Your path of life with joys be fair! Though wither these, no fading there; Nor thorny care your footsteps rue. [At the end of the Singing, Tumult is heard without at a distance.] Gov. What din is this that seems approaching us? Le Clerc. [Entering hastily.] My lord, take shelter in the church! There's death In the streets. Gov. What! Of Messina, sir; and I Its governor? Am I to slink away In fear? Swords, gentlemen! What man is he Comes first? who flies, yet halts,—whom they, in chase of, Striving, yet seem to fear, to overtake, Turning pursuit to flight whene'er he stops And shows them front? Le Clerc. 'Tis Angelo Martini. Gov. What savage deed hath made a brute of him, That men become a pack, and hunt him thus? Le Clerc. He has kill'd the Count de Marlez! Fern. Life for life! The count first kill'd his daughter—little wrong, To wrong more grievous that preceded it. Gov. You are sure of this? Fern. I am. Gov. Succour him, sirs. Fern. Too late! Mart. [without]. Take that! [Enters staggering, followed by Guiscardo and others with swords drawn. —Full payment, slave, and prompt! As you are Christian men, don't suffer them Hack me to death. I am wounded mortally! [Falls. Fern. How is it, Angelo Martini? Mart. Thus, Fernando, thus!—My daughter!—Where were you? But I forgive you! [Dies. Fern. O, look up, old man! Guis. He sleeps too sound, Fernando, to awake! My lord, the Governor, protection for The friends of Angelo Martini, who, With naked weapons had not stood in the streets But to protect him from foul butchery, His mansion suffer'd violence, last night, And murder in the person of his child; Now burn'd to ashes with her natal roof, Which Angelo himself in frenzy fired. He caught and slew the caitiff, for which act, By nature warranted, if not by law, Began this game of death, which we would spoil, But thus the just yet weaker side hath lost. Gov. Though great his crime first slain, the blood, so shed, Was French! Moreover, it was noble! Look Yourselves to your lives—I will not answer for them Beyond Messina! Hence, and sheathe your blades. Marks are upon them that offend our eyes, And breed you danger! Guis. Are we safe, the while? Gov. You are, but quit Messina. Guard them to The outskirts of the town. Guis. Fernando, speak. Look there. Your bridal flowers have gone, you see, To deck a bloody bier. So fare thy joys! [Goes out with others guarded. Gov. Remove the body. In our way it lies. Iso. Nay, father; sooner let us go about! Gov. Come on, then. Pro. [Coming from the back of the stage.] Stop. The rites must not proceed. Gov. They have not yet begun! Pro. Nor must begin! Gov. Who shall prevent them? Pro. Heaven. In the name of which I charge you to desist! Gov. Your reasons? Pro. Those, The bridegroom, when alone, shall learn; for him They most regard. Fern. Impart them, then! Pro. Not here. Gov. You juggle with us! Pro. No; the part I act Is honest. Gov. You are a religious man? Pro. A man devoted to a holy cause! Young man, let go that hand and come with me! Iso. Is this the dark fulfilling of my dream? Respect you, my Fernando, what he says? Fern. His tone, his words, his looks, his gestures, all Declare authority. Iso. O, do not go? Pro. He must, would he escape my curse; which here On him, and all who hold alliance with him, I shall invoke, resists he my commands. Gov. You dare not do it! Pro. Dare not!—listen then— Iso. Peace!—Drop my hand and go. Pro. She bids thee go. Come. Iso. Go, Fernando! Pro. Mark again; she bids thee. Why shouldst thou hesitate? The cause is thine. And thou thyself art constituted judge. I hope thou'rt a brave man, and not afraid To trust thyself with me. If idly, or On slight pretence I interpose, thou knowest Thou canst come back, and then the rites go on. So mayst thou gain thy bride, and 'scape my curse. Iso. Shall he come back in any case? Pro. He shall. Iso. Go! go! Fernando. Pro. That is the third time She bade thee go. Fern. I follow! Pro. Come along. [Procida and Fernando go out. Isoline faints in her father's arms, as the latter disappears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —A Mountain Pass. Etna in the distance. Enter Procida and Fernando. Pro. Look up. What seest thou? Fern. Etna. Pro. Where stands Etna? Fern. In Sicily. Pro. Then this is Sicily, Where Etna stands, and thou look'st up to it. And yet, methinks, thou knowest not thou stand'st In Sicily. Fern. I know it, well as thou! Pro. Deny it, then! Tell him, who says thou stand'st there, He but insults thee! Rather say thou stand'st In any other isle that spots the sea; And give thy oath to it, though Etna there, Before thee, should break silence at the lie, And bellow forth—“'Tis Sicily thou stand'st in!” Fern. Beware! young blood is hot. Pro. Behoves it, then, Beware it runs no peril from its heat. Young blood is generous, too!—not always!—Then Its heat is virtue bringing virtue forth, As sun, the healthful plant, in stronger flower. Its heat is as the thing it acts upon; As summer in the garden genders fruit, But in the swamp breeds poison. Know me, sir, So far. I wear a sword! [Throws off his gown.] Now of thy heat Why should I stand in fear? Fern. Lest thou offend Mine honour! Pro. Show it me, I'll not offend it; Else I offend mine own! If I gainsay The square, the plummet, or the level, what Shall I gain credence for? I am a fool Or knave. I either know not; or deny, Yet know! But honour is the name as well As thing, and with the thing not always goes, But serves a spurious owner, as the stamp Of gold at times is given to base coin. The gambler that will load a die, will cut Your throat, so you dare tell him on't—for honour! The libertine who uses, for your shame, Your hospitable trust—a felon, worse Than he who filches purses with his sword— Demands your blood, if you impugn his honour! Whence, with a coward world, the bully Lust Hath gracious entertainment at the hands Which hold the custody of maidens' snow, And never question'd matrons'. What do you say To the honour of a traitor—false at once To his liege lord and country?—taking part With their arch, pitiless, contentless foes? Shall such a man have honour? Ay, shall he so, Hath he the bloodhound's quality to vouch The barefaced lie a truth! Fern. Thou lovest danger! Pro. No, I love virtue, sir, and fear not danger. Art thou Sicilian? Fern. Yes. Pro. Sicilian born? Fern. Yes. Pro. In the mountain island first drew breath? Fern. Yes. Pro. Art thou sure? Where saw'st thou first the sun, To know him as thou recollectest? Fern. In Messina. Pro. Knowest thou the history Of this thy native land?—who was her king When first thou mad'st acquaintance with the sun, The blessed sun God gave thee leave to see When he vouchsafed thee draw the breath of life In Sicily? Fern. Why Manfred, then, was king. Pro. What came of him? Fern. He lost his crown. Pro. 'Tis false! Fern. [Aside.] What awes me in the presence of this man, That while he chafes me thus, I thus forbear! Pro. Were one to take thy purse from thee by force, Wouldst say that thou hadst lost it? Thou wouldst say That thou wast robb'd of it! So Manfred was Robb'd of his crown. Lost it! Who, say you now, Is king of Sicily? Fern. Charles of Anjou. Pro. That's false Again! Charles of Anjou is an usurper And not a king!—not king of Sicily. Manfred was slain in battle, was he not? Fern. He was. Pro. He was! He died as became a king Defending his own crown against the robber Who wrench'd it from his brow. You answer well! You know your country's history! What next? Who follow'd in the strife? Who struggled next With the arch felon?—held his throat to him— For it was nothing else, with powers so broken— Ere he would tamely be a looker-on, And see him wear the spoil? Fern. Conradine. Pro. Yes! The chivalrous, the patriotic prince! He took the cause up—but he lost the day. Fern. And, with the day, his life. Pro. How? Can't you tell? Know you, so far, the tragedy, so well, And do you halt at the catastrophe Which brings the crowning horror of the whole? The prince was taken captive—taken alive— Whole! without scath! No wound, the matter, even, Of a pin's scratch! Now, mark the freebooter In Charles of Anjou—him thou namedst now The king of Sicily. Mark, now, how blood And plunder go together, like sworn friends. Conradine was a captive. What had he done? What Charles himself had done in such a case, And had a right so to have done, were he A saint and not a robber. Fought for the crown Of his forefathers! What could Conradine That Charles need fear? He was bound hand and foot. He was as one that's bed-ridden!—that's struck With a palsy! Charles had just as much to fear From Conradine as from an infant in the cradle! What did he to him?—He beheaded him! Fern. 'Twas sacrilege! Pro. 'Twas murder!—murder, sir! Murder and sacrilege!—Conradine met the scaffold In his own kingdom, like a host that's butcher'd In his own house, by thieves! Now mark, young man, How bruised, broken, lost in fortunes, still The noble spirit to the last bears up And towers above its fate. Beside the block, Within the axe's glare, yet would not he Give up his righteous cause; but from his hand His gauntlet drew and flung into the space 'Twixt him and those who came to see him die. “For Jesu' sake,” he cried, “who loves me there, “Pick up my gage, and with it take the charge “A dying man gives with his parting breath; “That he present it to that kinsman of “My house, who takes its rightful quarrel up, “And whom with all my rights I here invest!” I see the story somewhat touches thee. Fern. I never heard it told so true before. Wast thou a stander-by? Pro. I was. What then? Fern. Didst thou pick up the gage? Pro. Wouldst thou have done it? Fern. I would! Pro. And wherefore? Fern. Out of pity for That murder'd king. Pro. What!—Given thy private cares, Hopes, havings, up, to consecrate thy life To his most desperate cause?—his throne usurp'd! His land o'errun! his people scatter'd, that Together not so many hung as one Might call a broken troop!—so seeming-lost A cause, as that, at cost so dear, hadst thou Embraced, and ta'en the gauntlet up? Fern. I had! Pro. [Taking a glove from his breast.] There 'tis! There!—as I pluck'd it from the scaffold foot! The look that martyr cast upon me then! It shed more healing unction on my soul, Than thought of thousand masses, at my death, Could do, each chanted by as many lips, And all of holy men. Now mark how Right, Although, at setting out, a dwarf in thews, By holding on, will gather sinew, till It moves that giant Might! With seconding Levies, munitions, allies, subsidies— None other than this empty glove, I went From Sicily; where now I stand again, With monarchs and their kingdoms at my back, The sworn abettors of the righteous hand, Which fleshless, tendonless, reduced to bone, Its holy cause thus clothes with life again, And arms with retribution. That same hand Once fill'd this glove, which now I hold to thee. Take it! Fern. For what? Pro. To swear by it. Fern. The oath? Pro. Death to the Gaul, whoe'er he be, that now Has footing in the land!—Death without pause Of ruth—Eye, ear, be stone to voice or look Of deprecation! Once your blade is out, While there's a tyrant's heart to lend a sheath, Ne'er to resume its own! Fern. An oath like that I will not take. Pro. Thou wilt not? Thou'rt a traitor! Fern. Ha! Pro. Thou'rt a coward! Fern. [Drawing.] Try if I fear death! Pro. Death is a little thing to brave or fear, Except the thought of the after-reckoning, The which to fear becomes, not shames a man. 'Tis but a plunge and over, ta'en as oft By the feeble as the stout! Give me the man That's bold in the right—too bold to do the wrong! Not bold as that, thou art a traitor still And coward! Fern. Draw! Pro. For what?—to pleasure thee? To place myself on base equality With one whom I look down upon? Fern. Or draw, Or I shall spurn thee! Pro. Villain, to thy knee! Fern. My knee! Pro. What!—Fear'st thou degradation? How Can he crouch lower than he does who kneels To his own weaknesses, when Duty bids him Stand up, and take the manly post, becomes him, At the side of Virtue? Were thy mother—she That bore thee in her womb—in fetters, how Wouldst deal with those that put them on? Wouldst talk And laugh with them—shake hands with them—embrace them? “Thou wouldst not!” But I tell thee, slave, thou wouldst; For what's thy country, be she not thy mother, And like a mother loved by thee? Thou slave, That seekest kindred with thy country's foes! Hast thou a father? Fern. Draw! Pro. Hast thou a father? Fern. But with my sword's point will I answer thee! Pro. Hast thou a father, boy? Fern. Hast thou a hand? Behoves that it be quick, and seek thy sword! Thy life's in danger! Pro. Hast thou a father, still I say to thee? Fern. Thy sword, or I'm upon thee! Pro. Then wilt thou have a murder on thy soul; For from my stand I will not budge an inch, Nor move, so far, my arm to touch my sword, Until thou answer'st me. Hast thou a father? Fern. [Bursting into tears.] No,—no! thou churlish, harsh, remorseless man— That bait'st me with thy coarse and biting words, As boors, abroad, let loose unmuzzled dogs Upon a tether'd beast!—my arm withheld By thy defencelessness, that hast defence, At hand, but will not use it—Who art thou To use me thus?—to do me shameful wrong And then deny me means to right myself? What have I done to thee to use my heart As if its strings were thine to strain or rend! Thou mak'st my veins hot with my boiling blood, And not content, thou followest it up, Mine eyes inflaming with my scalding tears, Thou kindless, ruthless man! Hast thou a father? I never knew one! Pro. [Aside.] I thank Heaven! Fern. Thou hadst A father—hadst a father's training—O How blest the son that hath! O Providence, What is there like a father to a son? A father, quick in love, wakeful in care, Tenacious of his trust, proof in experience, Severe in honour, perfect in example, Stamp'd with authority! Hadst such a father? I knew no training, save what fostering Gave me, in charity; and was bestow'd Like bounty to a poor dependent; which He might take or leave. Those who protected me Were masters of my native land, not sons. How could I learn the patriot's lofty lesson? They told me Sicily had given me birth, But then they taught me, also, I was son To a contentless and ungracious mother. And they were kind to me! What wouldst thou have Of a young heart, but what you'd ask of wax— To take the first impression given to it? Except that, unlike wax, it is not quick What once it takes to render up again. Pro. [Aside.] O, my poor boy! Fern. If thou hadst such a father, 'Twas cruel, knowing that thou wast so rich, To taunt me, where, knew'st not that I was poor, Thou mightst at least suspect my poverty. How had I loved my father! He had had The whole of my heart! I would have given it him As a book to write in it whate'er he would! I never had gainsaid him—never run Counter to him. I had copied him, as one A statue of the rare and olden virtue, In jealous, humble imitation. I had lived to pleasure him. Before I had Disgraced him, I had died! Pro. [Aside.] My son! My son! Fern. Thou weep'st! Why?—Why? Pro. Thou wast made captive in A storméd hold. Fern. I was. Pro. That hold belong'd To John of Procida. Fern. It did. Pro. 'Twas storm'd And taken, in his absence. Fern. So 'tis said. Pro. That John of Procida had then a son Just four years old. Fern. That age was mine, I have heard, When first the Governor adopted me. Pro. There was no other child within the castle. Fern. Was there not? Pro. No! Fern. I must have been that child! Pro. Upon his right fore-arm he bore a mark. Fern. Yes; here! Pro. Yes; in the very place thou point'st to. Fern. I am the son of John of Procida! Pro. Thou art!—and I am John of Procida. Fern. [Falling on his knee.] Father! Pro. My son! My boy! My child I left At four years old and thought was dead! Fern. Thou own'st me? Pro. Own thee!—Ay!—Look at me and tell me, boy, Dost thou not see thy father? Fern. Yes! Thy looks Are words of love that call me, from thy feet, Up to thy arms. Pro. Up to them, then! Fern. [Rising, and throwing himself into the arms of Procida.] My father! Pro. O, my son! Fern. What shall I do? Pro. What mean you? Fern. What shall I do? Give me the glove! Pro. My son! Fern. The gauntlet of The martyr king! Pro. There!—Stop! Not now, my son: I find thee quick in the affection Thou owest me; and which, like a rich spring Just struck, in ample volume bubbles high, And runs a rapid stream! Not yet, my son; I will not take advantage of the burst To let it hurry thee along with it. A sudden change and violent, is scarce A lasting one. Thou mightst repent it. No; I'll prove thee ere thou join'st the holy cause. Thou to Messina shalt return once more, Before thou see'st her free. My word was given. Thou art a man. Men that uphold the name Act, not from impulse, but reflection. Declare thy meditated nuptials things Thy duty to thy neighbour and thy God Compels thee to abandon; then come back, With every let removed, and take the oath; And live the son of John of Procida. Fern. When I can say thy first behest is done, I'll show myself to thee. Farewell! [Goes out. Pro. Farewell! How suddenly his visage brighten'd up, At mention of returning to Messina. What speed is there! Is't all on my account? Now he is gone, my heart misgives me. What Have I done! Why do we pray that we be spared Temptation, but that 'tis a whirlpool, which, Once we're within its vortex, draws us in, Charybdis like, and sucks us down to ruin! Should I call him back? I will! He is out Of hearing! Should his love for her be strong? I did not note if she was very fair. But souls were never made for eyes to read, And there lies woman's beauty! If she loves Strongly—and O how strongly woman loves— The force of two hearts must he struggle with! I'll trust in Heaven! Alas! how many trust In Heaven, and, all the while, betray themselves! If he's my son!—I talk with fifty years For counsellors! O, it was oversight, Preposterous in a father! If I have found My son to lose him—best I ne'er had found him. Yet ere I lose him I will risk my life— Risk all—except the sacred cause I'm pledged to. [Goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —Isoline's Chamber. Enter Governor and Isoline. Gov. Thus, save the nature of the grievous wrong Which on my conscience weighs—which, to repair I to Fernando would have wedded thee, Will wed thee still, comes he to claim thy hand— Of all have I possess'd thee—who he is; The mortal enmity his father bears me; The public foe join'd to the private one; His hatred of our race, love for his own; Devotion to the dynasty, held sway In Sicily, ere France supplanted it! Hopes to make head again; efforts, intrigues With foreign powers to raise up foes to France. That he whose presence stopp'd the rites to-day, May act in concert with the Procida, Though past the scope of probability, Lies within that of chance; for though Fernando Knows not his parentage, yet accident May have reveal'd the son to Procida. View then these nuptials thus. If solemnized, Joy not without regrets—if frustrated, Regrets with yet their solaces. Iso. I will, sir. Gov. Do so; and so good night. Another word. Set not thy heart on seeing him again; He never may return. Or, say he should, Expect him to depart and come no more. You mark? Iso. I do, sir. Gov. Now good night again. [Goes out. Iso. What, Marguerite!—Come hither, Marguerite. Hast done it? [To Marguerite, who enters.] Mar. He is in the oratory. Iso. I thank the holy man. He will remain there? Mar. Ay, madam. Iso. He was ever good to me! Fernando will return to-night—I know He will. My heart assures me that he will, And lovers' hearts a strange foreknowledge have, Though read they not the stars. That's he! Go, look! [Marguerite goes out. O, that this hour were past! Alas, 'tis thus We wish us ever nearer to our graves, With fear of this, and with desire for that; Flying from one thing, following another, As rushing from the very thing itself For which we pray, towards that we pray against! Knew I the moment—ay, the very moment I wedded him—I should be spouse to death; Away with life! at once, he should be mine! Enter Marguerite. Mar. 'Tis not Fernando. Iso. Keep upon the watch. [Marguerite goes out. He shall be mine! Shall private enmities, On others' parts, set bars 'twixt those that love? Make of two hearts, grown one, two hearts again Distinct and alienate? or rather—for, Judging mine own Fernando's heart by mine, That can't be done—untwine two lives, which love Has drawn together till they grow like tendrils, Knotted and interwreathed, that without bruising You cannot part them—maybe killing them? It should not be, and shall not! Now the chances? No let can I divine to sway Fernando, Except that father, yet he knows not of; And whom, new found, new feelings welcoming, Will, at the moment, large surrender make, Haply at cost of love itself! What then? Love that is steadfast brooks not sacrifice. It may submit awhile; but, in the end, It ever claims its own—the paramount Of all affections! So, his love, at first O'ercome, anon will vindicate itself. Whereto no weak retreating, no false shame On the part of mine, shall offer hindrance to me, From giving 't all my help. Enter Marguerite. Mar. I hear a step. Iso. Go see if it be his. [Marguerite goes out.] Why should I blush To claim my love's due right? Is love a thing To blush for?—Love!—the choicest of all The household pure affections, things of truth And piety next what we owe to Heaven! Love that makes friendship poor—that mocks enhancement— Itself possession endless!—that's example Of loyalty!—its master better served Than monarchs on their thrones, his throne himself! That more abounds in sunshine of content, Than destiny, in clouds, to quench the light. Whole in itself! Love, that is chastity 'Fore that of vestal perfectness!—the world For choice, yet one with leave of Heaven selecting And giving all beside to negligence!— As the refiner the alloy, when once He finds the extracted gold. He shall be mine! The maid, that's not stanch stickler for her love, Hath little on't to strive for. She may smile Scornful good-bye, and turn upon her heel; Forget and love again; or think she does— For by the love I feel, she knows not love; My love's a heap takes all my heart to hold, As rich as large, and shan't be cast away! Re-enter Marguerite. Mar. 'Tis he!—I beckon'd him. He follows me. Iso. Take stand behind the hanging stealthily, And there keep watch. And ever recollect You are mine honour's sentinel, and bound To let thine eye no parley hold with sleep, So much as e'en a wink. As open as Your eye, your ear; to note whate'er may pass, And in thy memory to book it down, And faithfully; for, on some syllable May something hang, which in esteem I hold Next to my soul's salvation! Quick! He comes. [Marguerite hides. Enter Fernando. Iso. [after a pause]. Fernando, art thou there? Fern. Ay, Isoline. Iso. Art thou indeed? Fern. I am. Iso. I note thee speak, Yet can't believe thee there. Fern. Why? Iso. Why, Fernando! If but the morning, noon, or afternoon, Withdrew thee from me; when thou camest again, Thine eyes would melt, thy breath grow scant, thy cheek Turn pale and red; and I was ever met Like new-found, wondrous treasure! Yesterday It had been so.—What hath befallen to-day To make it look so utterly unlike Its happy fellow? Dost not joy, Fernando, To see me? Fern. Joy!—Ay, as the mariner To see the day, o'erta'en by storm at night, But knows 'tis vain, his vessel foundering! Iso. Explain thy speech, my love. Fern. He was a friend Who took me hence, a most dear friend, although One that I wot not of until to-day,— None other than a father, Isoline! Iso. Thou hast found a father? Fern. I have found a father! And with that father I have held such converse As hath transform'd me so—except my love— I should not know myself; and being thus Dissimilar to him this morning was Thy bridegroom; from this night—that should have been Our bridal-night—all days and nights to come Am nothing to thee thou mayst name, except A merchant sailor for his argosie, That holds possession of the rock whereon She struck and went to pieces! Iso. We must part! Lovest thou me still, Fernando? Fern. Yes! Iso. As ever? Fern. As ever! Iso. Then, we do not part, my friend! Fern. Is't Isoline that speaks? Iso. Yes! Isoline! The very maid thou know'st so call'd—a maid, So chary of her virgin sanctity, Thee, her betrothed—thee, her almost espoused, She challenges to tell the moment, only, She gave thee license, she would bar thee name, Or blush to hear thee do so. Lo, the strait She is in!—at such an hour—in such a place To parley with thee, and the argument Her grievance—thy default—default in love! In love, Fernando!—thy default in that, Wherein that she fell short was the reproach Thou wont'st to urge against her, to the day The very hour she gave thee slow consent To lead her to the priest. Fern. Heaven witness!— Iso. Peace! No words—save such as make reply to questions. We part—why? Lies the reason at my door? Am I to blame? Then fit we part! If not, It is not fit! I have no right to suffer. Suffer, Fernando!—Did you hear me?—Heavens! The boon, with showers of tears and gusts of sighs You won from me, I call it suffering, To find you would not take! But I'm a woman, Strong in the faculty your nobler sex Advance large claims to, with most poor pretensions— Once cleaving, cleaving still. We shall not part. You think to leave me! Try! The cement, that Becomes a portion of the things it joins, So that as soon you tear themselves apart As them from it, not more tenaciously Keeps hold than I! Piecemeal they may disjoin us, But perfect, never! Fern. Isoline! Iso. Fernando! When I consented to become thy wife, I gave myself to thee. A thousand rites Not more had made me thine. I was thy wife That very hour—that very minute! All Ties of reserves, heeds, other interests, That held my heart from thee I snapp'd at once, And like a woman gave it thee, entire! Whole and for ever!—ay, so gave it thee, Were I and all my race in slavery, And it, the ransom, which, on paying down, The shackles would fall off—gall as they might, They must remain. I could not take it back, Not even if I would. Fern. Nay, Isoline! Iso. Nay, hear me out, Fernando. There is a ward By nature set o'er the true woman's heart, Undream'd of by thy sex, except the few Of the true manhood, that contemplate them With delicate regards. Without that ward Woman is won and lost, and lost and won, As oft we see; but, with it, won—lost never; Though won unworthily—a contradiction, Yet proof of her pure nature! which, it seems, Falls to thy lot to test. You are, here, to take The oath, I vow'd to take along with thee. Fern. I cannot take it. Iso. Cannot! You have a voice And organs apt to frame it into speech, Most pliant ones, as I can testify! Fern. I may not take it. Iso. May not! What are you? What are you, sir! a ward, or a free man Acting his part upon his own account— Upon his own responsibility? Fern. I may not for thy sake. Iso. For my sake, sir! The sand of the very hour you gave me leave To look to myself, is running still!—not half, Nor quarter out! For shame, to wrong me first, And then to mock me! Fern. I must take an oath— Iso. When?—where?—to whom? No matter! You were bound To me, before, to take an oath—and shall— And judge me worthily as you're a man! But that I have a title to thy hand— But that 'tis mine, upon the warranty Of Earth and Heaven, that heard thee say 'twas mine— Brought it the wealth and power of all the thrones That glitter on the earth, and I could have it By only asking for it—ere I could speak The word, I'd choke, blacken before thee, fall A corpse at thy feet! Fern. Now let me speak! To wed thee Is wedding thee to misery! Iso. Content; I will wed misery. Fern. My Isoline, Thou wouldst ally thee to a house, the foe Of thee and all thy race! Iso. Unto that house Will I ally myself. Fern. The consequences! Iso. Be they the worst, I am prepared for them. I'll take them all on mine own head. Fern. The strife that's sure to come!—Man as I am, my soul Sickens to think on't. Iso. Woman as I am, I dare it to come on. Fern. Rivers of blood Will flow! Iso. They are welcome, though my veins be breathed To help the flood.—Redeem your promise, sir! Fern. O, Isoline! By this dear hand— Iso. Hold off! In the relation wherein now we stand, I will not suffer even touch from thee! Nor shalt thou trifle with me—for to speak Or act, save to the point, is only trifling. Here—in the oratory—close at hand,— Attends the holy man, whose offices You craved, this morning, and, at my entreaty, Though strangely summon'd, hardly would forego. Follow me to him! Take my hand before him! Plight with me troth for troth!—or here remain Till night gives up her watch to day, and then, Departing hence, to crown thy bounty, leave me A spotless maiden with a blasted name! Fern. Thou couldst not dream of such perdition, and To bring it on thyself! Iso. Men cannot dream What desperate things a desperate woman dreams, Until they see her act them! Fern. Desperate! Iso. Yes, desperate! Sweet patience! Men go mad To lose their hoards of pelf, when hoards as rich With industry may come in time again! Yet they go mad—It happens every day! Have not some slain themselves? Yet if a maid— Who finds that she has nothing garner'd up Where she believed she had a heart in store For one she gave away—is desperate, You marvel at her! Marvel!—when the mines Of all the earth are poor as beggary To make her rich again! Am I ashamed To tell thee this?—No!—Save the love we pay To Heaven, none purer, holier, than that A virtuous woman feels for him she'd cleave Through life to. Sisters part from sisters—brothers From brothers—children from their parents—but Such woman from the husband of her choice Never!—Give me the troth you promised me. Fern. Never didst thou reflect that I was born In Sicily? Iso. I know thou'rt a Sicilian. Fern. Didst ne'er reflect upon it? Iso. To what end Should I reflect? Fern. To spurn me as a man Devoid of honour! Iso. Who dares call thee so? Fern. He who dares speak the truth. Thou know'st—thou must— The wrongs my country suffers! Iso. Yes: I know She suffers wrongs. I have wept for them, Fernando. Fern. Have you?—Have you wept for them? I have heard them Without a tear! Am I a man of honour? Iso. What good were it to weep? Fern. None—but to feel As you could weep—and then, with manlier thought, Let fiery revenge instead of pity Start into your eye and look the wronger dead!— That—that were good. It were becoming, too, In one who owes his birth to Sicily. I have not done so! O, I have play'd a part Most mean and spiritless!—Have proffer'd smiles Where it behoved me to hurl frowns!—exchanged Kind speech for curses, and griped hands with men, With whom, had I clash'd daggers, I had done The proper thing! What must men think of me? Is there a lip I know, which, did it speak The heart of the owner, would not curl at me? O, shame!—to be despised! regarded as A thing, the man who understood himself Would use his foot to!—to despise one's self! That's it! The scorn of all the world beside I could endure, had I my own respect; But that is lost. No man can call me worse Than I behold myself. Iso. Fernando— Fern. Nay! Suffer me speak, for it relieves my heart! And as you love me—which I know you do— Do not gainsay me! I am a wretch more fit To die than live!—and yet not fit to die! For of all sins that on their heads men bear, The heaviest, because the instrument Of widest injury, are those which they Commit against their country. I am fit For nothing but a beacon, to point out The rock whereon my honour suffer'd wreck, That other men's may 'scape it. Iso. Was that rock Thy love for me? Fern. Love?—Love?—What do I know Of love? Where is the love I ought to bear My country? Love?—It is a holy passion! Generous!—exalted!—with integrity, Lasting, as adamant!—He can know nothing Of love like that who does not love his country! Iso. Lov'st thou not me? Fern. Old Angelo Martini! Iso. Lov'st thou not me? Fern. Angelo, my old master, Who taught me how to guard a life, and take one, Was murder'd yesterday, because he slew A miscreant—the foulest in the list Of Infamy's pernicious sons!—was hunted Like a wild beast that's from a thicket sprung By dogs, and chased for sport! I might have saved him, And didn't!—Why?—Because my heart was rotten! I owed him manly knowledge—kindness—love. He loved me as his son. I suffer'd them To hunt him!—worry him to death! I did. Am I a man at all? Iso. Lovest thou not me? Fern. Ay, Isoline, as much As such a wretch can love!—Love thee?—I do, And holily—if holy thing can dwell In most unhallow'd habitation. Love thee? How dare I love thee? Temple as thou art Of tenderness, of chastity, and truth; Truth most ingenuous! Is it thy arms I should aspire to?—Thine, my Isoline! Whose foot ne'er spurn'd from thee a thing, so base, As that which now, in utter misery, I cast before it. [Dashing himself upon the ground. Iso. Rise, Fernando, rise, My lord—My love! What has afflicted thee To this severe extremity? Fernando! Thou scarest me! This passion hath no reason! 'Tis wantonness of frenzy!—Dost thou hear me? If not thyself, dear love—consider me! That's right!—that's kind!—Give me thy hand and rise. I dream'd not this. Thank Heaven you're calmer! O I thought I loved thee all that I could love, But now I find my love, disdaining bounds, Is endless and unfathomable. Now I find I loved thee but a little, and With that remain'd contented; never dreaming How misery endears, and what a heap Of love was yet to come in company With thy affliction. What shall I do for thee! I am thy bane—a blight—a canker to thee! Shall I die? [Plucks a dagger from his girdle. Fern. Hold!—Stop!—Nay, let my dagger go! Iso. You have griped hands, you said, with those with whom You ought to have clash'd daggers, and 'twas done For me!—Don't hurt me, dear Fernando! There! [Lets go the dagger. Fern. Are you mad? Iso. No!—Calm as you are—you shall see. [Goes to the door and throws it open. The door is free!—The first, the last embrace! And go! Fern. Part?—Never! Thou art in my arms! Thou shalt not leave them but for the embrace, Succeeds the knot, that makes us one for ever! Come woe!—come death!—come every kind of bane! Thou pattern of devotion! Thou true woman! Thou ruby worth a mine, and fitly set! Which is the way?—Where bides the holy man? Is that the portal to the oratory? What means thy cheek by dropping on my breast? Does it say “Yes?”—Hold up, mine own dear love, And come along. We'll kneel to Heaven to-night, And trust to it for to-morrow.—Come, love, come. [They go out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —A Chamber in the Castle. Enter Le Clerc and Francois. Fran. Is this a bridal feast, where all seem glad Except the bride and bridegroom? Do you note Their looks? Le Clerc. I do; and might I read thereby Their hearts, I should infer them ill at ease. Fran. When were their nuptials solemnized? Le Clerc. Last night, And very privately. You did not know— You are but new arrived from Syracuse? Fran. Only in time to see the festival, If I may call it so, in honour of them. Le Clerc. You know not then their nuptials were appointed For yesterday—were on the very eve Of taking place; nor what prevented them? Fran. No. Le Clerc. This way, then, and I shall tell you. Here Are company might interrupt us. Come! [They go out. Enter Martel and Ambrose. Mar. Abstraction half so deep ne'er saw I yet In one so high in favour with good fortune! Excess of happiness, like that of grief, Will palsy feeling, till the owner seems not To know how hugely blest he is; but still Some token shows the nature of the lapse; Here, none. Within the table's breadth of him I sat, and mark'd him. 'Twas not feasting, sir; He seem'd as he were jealous of the viands, Like one upon his guard 'gainst poison'd meats. He did not eat, but taste; while, at his side, His bride—whose eyes, purveyors never weary Of catering for their lord, kept ranging still The table over, to select for him Whate'er was daintiest—with busy lips, Like pages who their errands blushing tell, Commended to him ever and anon The well-selected cheer, but all in vain. Amb. I craved his leave to pledge him in a cup. He took the cup; but straight its use forgetting, Began to pore upon the rich contents: Then, as a thing one does mechanically, Raising it to his lip, without the due And custom'd courtesy, he tasted it And set it down again. Mar. Remark'd you not How strainingly he fix'd upon the door His eyes, whene'er it chanced to open, as He look'd for one to enter, he had rather Should keep away? Amb. That struck me very much, And brought to mind the unwelcome visitor, Whose errand stopp'd his nuptials yesterday. Mar. So was't with me. For him, or some one like him, Be sure he look'd, with more of certainty Than doubt.—The bride and bridegroom, and alone! Let us withdraw, nor mar their privacy. [They go out. Enter Fernando and Isoline. Fern. You are right, my love; the grape is generous, And, used in the wise proportion, cheers the heart. Iso. You are better!—are you not? Fern. Much!—very much! Iso. O, blessed union that of two makes one! Could I, dear love, have bought the world just now By paying down for it one hearty smile, I must have lost the bargain, seeing thee Without one! It was otherwise before! How often have I smiled at that same want! But, now, come o'er your looks the slightest cloud, All light of mine is gone.—Fernando!—Love! Is it not sweetest partnery? Fern. It is. Iso. It is, indeed, my love! Say as I do! It is, indeed, most sweet! Fern. Indeed, it is. Was't not the castle portal open'd now? I know its ponderous sound! 'Tis shut again! It was the portal! Iso. Whom look you for, dear love? All your good spirits gone! Fern. No, Isoline; Not all of them!—not half!—not any of them! We'll spend the evening joyously, dear love! Out-do the god of merriment himself; And when he's out of laughter, lend him some, And still, ourselves, hold on! Who's there? Enter Eugene and Others. Eug. My lord, We are passing to the ball-room. Fern. Pray pass on. And keep the measure up! Eug. We shall, my lord. [Going out with others. Fern. That's right; and so shall I! Iso. So do! dear love! For me!—your Isoline!—your bride!—your wife! Fern. You are my wife!—The treasure of my heart Is treasure of my arms! Who rich as I, And says he is not happy? Then is he Beyond the ministering of content, And be despair his portion! I am not A man like that. Iso. My love, this cheer makes sad. Fern. Makes sad? Iso. It is not of the kind, gives cheer. It wants a quiet. Fern. Wants a quiet? Here Lay on my brow this white and velvet hand Thou gavest me yesterday. Iso. It burns, dear love; And yet how pale it is! Fern. I have seen a man In fever—and he burn'd, and yet was pale— Pale as a corpse! Iso. Thou hast no fever? Fern. No. The cup has pass'd too often to my lips— Not much—only a time or two!—What proves A spark to one, another finds a fire. Don't heed it, dearest life!—O, what a hand! What could be spared of it, or added to it? Shape?—No! Hue?—No! Touch?—No! Does it breathe? It does! The airs of heaven! I will inhale them nearer! [Kissing her hand. Iso. You flatter, dearest lord! Fern. No, by my love! Iso. Yea, by your love, indeed, dear lord, you do! You are a culprit, who for witness calls The arch accomplice that would swear him off. Fern. By all—[Louis enters.] Ha!—'Sdeath, you tread on tiptoe, sir, You are at my elbow ere I think you there! Louis. Your pardon! I was musing, sir, and thus Moved slow. 'Tis strange! but in the ball-room, now, One cross'd me in a mask, and made me start, By something in his carriage and his form Resembling one I must have met before, But where I cannot guess. Whoe'er it be, A feeling of mistrust that cross'd my heart, Assures me 'twas no friend. Fern. What? Seem'd he old Or young? Louis. Men's figures do not tell their years Well as their faces do; yet would I say, Guessing, thereby, his progress on life's road, He stands more near the end, than setting out. Fern. Commanding in his air? Louis. Very. Fern. His gait Of most assured tread? Louis. Yea, as he spurn'd The ground he walk'd on. He and I have met, But when, or where, or upon what occasion, I can't recall, nor till I do, can rest. Farewell, and pardon me. 'Tis very strange! [Goes out. Iso. [To Fernando, who is lost in thought.] Dear husband, you conjecture something! What? Fern. Nothing! Iso. O, love, be honest!—It is best Always.—If evil comes of it, at worst We have been honest—That will comfort us. Come!—I will show you, what I teach, I do. I don't believe our union will be bless'd! You start!—and you yourself assured me so, And now I tell it you!—I don't believe it. What then?—Do I repent our union? No! My heart has had its wish—I am thy wife. Knew I that I should die the very moment The priest should bless us, and declare us one, I had married thee and yielded up my spirit, Thanking the gracious Heavens, most bountiful, Which for that little moment made thee mine. Then cheer thee, love; and be assured of this— Were we to live the threescore years and ten, And then to die, being what now we are, We could not die more happy! Lose not now With care for by-and-by, whate'er may come; But leave't, with trust, to Heaven! Fern. I'll do thy will! I'll be myself!—The ball-room!—Come, love, come! SCENE II. —A Ball-Room. Fernando, Isoline, and Others discovered.—A Dance. Fern. Surely the lightsomest, most graceful form, And act of merriment! I'd give the world To have the mood of him who danced just now. How he appear'd to poise him in the air, As he could hang there at his will, by which Alone he seem'd to come to earth again! He did not spring, but fly from step to step! With joints that had not freer play'd, methinks, Were hinges made of air and theirs were such! Yet could they plant themselves, I warrant me, To meet a shock! These spirits are fine things, Subtle as quicksilver; only they freeze Sooner than water; one cold breath, and ice! Iso. Will you not dance? Fern. No. Iso. 'Tis expected, love, Upon your nuptial day. Fern. I would not dance. Iso. No more would I, dear love, to please myself; But we must help the mirth that's made for us, Else will it flag, and die. A feast, in this, Is like a fray, wherein the side is lost Whose leader is not foremost, cheering it. For my sake only! I must bear the blame, Seem you to lack content. They will believe That you repent you of your bargain, love. Would you like that?—What had you done a month Ago, had I refused to dance with you? How had you look'd as all the world were lost; Urged me again—again; at every turn Your voice yet more attuning to the tone That melts; invoking me in the dear name Of Pity and whate'er is kin to her. I had heard, in these things, marriage turns the tables, And she, that once was woo'd, must turn to woo, But little dream'd to find it out so soon. Fern. Sweet love, we'll dance! Thy fair hand give to me, And, with it, give thy pardon. Iso. There, Fernando. A set!—A set!—The bride and bridegroom's set! Partners!—Your fair friends, gentlemen—A set To try the breath!—Ho, music there!—A strain Of brilliant figure! [Procida, in the dress of a cavalier, and masked, appears opposite to Fernando, who at once recognises him. Mar. Hear you, sirs? The bride Commands the dance—Your very newest strain, So 'tis the choicest, too. We are ready, madam, So please you take your place. Iso. Fernando, what's The matter?—Who is he you gaze upon? Do you know him? Fern. Don't you recollect him? Iso. No— Not in that mask. Who is he? Fern. Never mind! Iso. His presence troubles you! Whoe'er he is, I'll have him straight removed. Fern. Not for the world! He wants me! Iso. Let him wait till by-and-by! I'll speak to him myself and pray him go, And come some other time. Fern. Stay, Isoline! I would not for a mine thou spokest to him! I'll speak to him myself! Iso. Remember, love, The dance is waiting. Fern. Were't a king that waited, He must, until I spoke to him that's yonder! Where can I take him to?—to be alone? Iso. The garden. Fern. Right! When we have made an end, By the west door he can depart unseen. Iso. O, husband! Fern. Let me have my way in this, For I must! Look, love! Not surer to thy wrist Is knit thy hand than I am knit to thee! They cannot sever us, but I must perish! So now, no let, love, if you value me! Iso. Our friends, who look for us— Fern. He looks for me! Women, they say, are at invention quick— Prove it so now, and never more was need; And be my sweet apologist. [Crosses to Procida. Say naught, But follow me! [Procida and Fernando disappear among the Company. Iso. Your pardon, friends, I pray you. One, in some case of keenest urgency, That needs my husband's presence, takes him hence. Pray you proceed. I'll play the looker-on Till he repairs his fault to you and me, Taking his promised place. The music, there! A Dance. Louis. [Entering hastily.] Break off the dance!—an enemy is here! Lady, I have recall'd the name of him Whose presence struck me so unwelcomely— A foe, the subtlest and most powerful That France could find in Sicily! When, lately, On mission from the king I was sojourning At the court of Spain, came thither a Sicilian With charges foul 'gainst France, and praying aid To second some great blow, he said, the friends Of Sicily meditated. That same man Is he whose presence like an apparition Just now oppress'd me, as I told you—his name Is John di Procida! I have alarm'd The guard; apprised your father of his danger, And search is now on foot, which all must join. [The Company at once disperse in various directions— occasionally passing to and fro in the back-ground. Iso. Ambrose!—Le Clerc! Sirs, you are men of honour. You know me, too, a woman of that kin. You'll do my bidding, whatsoe'er it is? Amb. and Le Clerc. Yes; by these tokens. [Kissing the hilts of their swords. Iso. Good sirs, follow me! [They go out. SCENE III. —The Garden of the Castle. Enter Procida and Fernando. Fern. Now, sir, your will with me? Pro. That's right! I am glad Thou darest not call me father! 'Tis a sign Thou hast a sense of shame, and that's a virtue, Although a poor one, fitter far to weep at Than smile at. You have done your father's will? You are ready for that oath? Fern. I'll not deny My disobedience, sir. Pro. You'll not deny? You can't!—You have married her! Yet, if my son, Though in the one engagement thou hast fail'd, Thou, yet, wilt keep the other. Fern. Take that oath? I cannot now! Pro. You can!—You ought!—You shall! Fern. I am a man, sir! Pro. Ay? What kind of one? Fern. May be a weak one; yet I dare abide The issue of my weakness, and I will. Not breaking trust with those, it has misled To knit their fates to mine. Pro. You call this manhood? Ay, in a man not worth the name of one! How darest thou prate of keeping trust to me, With whom thou hast so vilely broken trust? So lately, too! Thou promisedst yesterday To bring me back my son to me! Where is he, sir? Why must I come to seek him, and, instead, Behold a recreant! Fern. Better, sir, we part, Than hold discourse on terms unequal thus, That I must bear, alone, and you inflict. Pro. No! We won't part! You come along with me! Fern. Never! Pro. As you're my son, I'll have it so! Fern. I'll not forsake the woman of my soul, Who to my bosom hath herself surrender'd. Come woe! Come shame! Come ruin! True to me, I'll not forsake her! Yea, come death, I'll clasp her Long as my breast can heave! Pro. You think this manhood Again? Sir! 'tis not what a man dares do, Nor what's expected from him by a man, But what Heaven orders him to do,—'tis that He should do. Heaven expects we keep its laws; May we make league then with the foes of Heaven? Or having made it, may we keep it? No!— Else we shall forfeit heaven! This base alliance Is even such a league. Break it! Fern. No! Pro. No?— Listen, degenerate boy! I'll tell thee that, In tearing which from me thou dost as bad As though my breast thou shouldst rip open, and Pluck out my heart alive! You never knew A mother? Fern. I remember there was one Upon whose breast I used to lie. Pro. 'Twas she. She had a mother's breast—the heart, within, Becoming its fair lodge—adorning it With all the sweet affections of her sex, And holy virtues that keep watch for them! Thou art like her! Dost thou mark? Thou art like her now; And so, I saw thou wast, upon her lap; A little baby looking up at her! Thou wast her first child, and her only one! Thou mayst believe she loved thee! Fern. Does she live? Pro. No; did she live, I were not now, perhaps, Debating with thee. Thou hadst granted her What thou deniest me. Wouldst thou behold her? Look here! Was that a woman? [Drawing a miniature from his breast. Fern. O, how fair! Pro. Was that a woman? Fern. Yes! Pro. No, boy! She was An angel! [Putting up the miniature. Fern. Let me look again! [Procida holds it to Fernando, who takes it, and after looking at it, is about to kiss it. Pro. Forbear! Thou shalt not kiss it! No, nor breathe upon it! There is contact on thy lips, at thought of which, Had she survived the ruin of my hold, And now were living, that sweet face, thou seest The limning of, had to the 'haviour turn'd Of deadly loathing!—of black horror!—aught That's removed farthest from that smile of Heaven! Had any mock'd that face, what were he to thee? Fern. An enemy! Pro. Had any smitten it? Fern. I had lopp'd his hand off, and then smitten him To the heart! Pro. Had any brought the blush upon it— The burning blush which innocence endures, Compell'd by him who does a deed so damn'd That murder spurns it, will not bide with it? Fern. I had hack'd him limb from limb!—slain him by inches! Pro. Thou hadst! Fern. I had! Pro. Back to the castle, then; To the room I brought thee from, the festal room, Where for thy nuptials they keep holiday, And when thou meet'st the master of the mirth, The Governor—the father of thy wife— Him thou art now a son to—tell him—mark me! Tell him—that very—that identical man— He was the miscreant, to thy mother did That very shame!—then nerve thy filial arm, And hack him limb by limb and inch by inch, As though in every atom lay the heart Of the accursed spoiler.—Go!—Do that, And then come back; and kiss thy mother's face! Fern. I hear, and doubt I hear. Pro. Then list again, And doubt no more. 'Twas during a brief truce. He was my guest—a guest 's a sacred thing; But, if he is, a host is sacred too. Thy mother vied with me in ministering to him The rites of hospitality—and what Was the return?—Such love indulged for her, As meditated bane of life to me! He did not dare to breathe it—he but look'd it! She saw what troubled her, and like a wife Perfect in honour—of herself best guardian— At once refused her presence on some plea That warded chance of quarrel, while it balk'd Licentiousness of opportunity. This when the truce was ended, told she me. Dost thou breathe thick?—I do, and must take breath, For what's to come. You listen, do you not? You look like stone! Fern. I know not what I am! Pro. Well!—War again.—Where was your father?—Where Behoves a loyal subject be—in the ranks Of the king when he takes the field.—You know we lost The day. Palermo, Syracuse, Messina, All bent the knee to the conqueror. Was I His subject? No!—Was I a rebel to him? No!—Why then should I be proscribed? Fern. Proscribed! Pro. I was so!—Keep thy wonder! What's behind Will want it. Through the arts of that same man— Of him that's now thy father through thy union With his pernicious child—was thy own father Proscribed. Have patience! His possessions cast At the feet of a licentious soldiery To scramble for and ravage. Fern. Infamy! Pro. I say again have patience. “Infamy!” No, not at all—not worth a passing frown, The deed 's to come. My castle yet remain'd; That, the arch-spoiler to himself reserved For plunder—for thy mother shelter'd there! She was the quarry which this bird of prey Had mark'd out for his pounce—which, when he saw 'Twas sure, he made!—swept down with ruthless wing, When none was near to cleave him ere he struck, Or scare him from his prey! Do you hear a shriek? Fern. Sir? Pro. Do you hear a shriek? Fern. No. Pro. Are you sure? Fern. I am; for never do I hear a shriek But my heart leaps as through my breast 'twould burst Its way! I cannot bear to hear a shriek! Pro. Thou heard'st thy mother's! as the ravisher Waved o'er thy head his coward blade, through terror At thy impending death, to win from her, What, sooner than yield up, she had lost, herself, A hundred thousand lives!—She swoon'd away! My heart turns sick, and my brain reels! Thy arm!— Away! thou worse than matricide—Thy touch With a new horror strings my nerves anew! Fern. Why was this tale reserved?—not told before? Pro. Because I found thee apt, as I believed, In taking up the hint of honour; nor Admitted fear it could be thrown away. Life's strong in me to tell the tale and live! How she contrived escape, to tell it me, It matters not—the last word cost her dear— 'Twas bought with her last breath.—You come with me? Fern. I am a dooméd man!—My lot, on earth, Is cast in utter misery!—For me, Not in the wide world blooms that blessed spot I can find comfort in! Pro. Find Duty, boy; And take thy chance for comfort! Fern. I can't leave her! Do wrong to her, did ever good to me! I took her for all chance, and through all chance I'll cleave to her! In cloud I wedded her, And thunder shall not scare me from her now! No blame is hers.—I swear that she is good. Loves holily as heartily. Is a gem Of crystal truth—a mine of every ore Of excellence—a paragon of worth, Well as a paragon of loveliness! Is she her father's hand or foot, that you Or I should spurn her for her father's fault? High Heaven framed her, as it frames us all, Not of the temper of our parentage, But of the attributes itself vouchsafes us. Heaven framed her to be loved—if to be loved, Then, cherish'd!—I have sworn to cherish her— I'll keep my oath!—I will not give her up. Pro. Then, must I leave thee to thy fate! Iso. [Entering.] Stop, sir! You are John of Procida! Pro. I am. Iso. The foe Of France; and, chiefly, of a son of hers Who calls me child. Pro. I am the foe of France, And chiefly foe of him thou speakest of. Iso. What madness brought thee hither? Pro. Madness?—Right! Hope of reclaiming a degenerate son, Spell-bound by love where it behoves him loathe! Iso. Your life's in jeopardy!—You are discover'd! Come in there!—Gentlemen, you'll guard him safely, And suffer none to question him or touch him; Nor must you leave him till he is thoroughly Beyond the reach of danger. Pro. Gracious powers! Do you rebuke me?—is it thus you show it? Iso. You are my enemy—and yet my father! Father to him—to me a dearer self! I'll answer with my life, sir, for the safety Of every hair of your head. Pro. Fernando! Fern. Sir? Pro. Come hither!—Lady, place your hand in mine. These hands that met, till now, against my will, Now, with my will, I join, and add thereto My blessing!—May I, Heaven?—I ask too late! 'Tis done!—A promise, lady! Iso. It is given! Pro. See that it be fulfill'd. You will repair To-night, ere at the zenith stops the moon, There, westward of Messina, on the coast, Where, when the waves and winds are boisterous, The fishermen their little fleets embay, And, in their snug huts nestling at their ease, Smile and grow jocund at the storm without. You know the place? Iso. I do—I will be there! Pro. And so will I—and you shall find a friend! [They go out severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. —A Bay near Messina.—The Sea.—Fishermen's Boats; in the offing a Fleet.—Moonlight. Enter John of Procida and Guiscardo. Pro. You look your news! 'Tis dire, but not unwelcome, Nor out of place nor out of season, that Men should cry “God forbid!”—That is, good men. It is the scourging, at report of which, Men, that rely on Heaven, upon their breasts Will cross their arms, though shuddering, and look up, In dread, yet gratitude. Chance has outdone Foresight; and Preparation, looking on With idle hands, can scarce believe its eyes To see the work, it labour'd for, fulfill'd Almost without its aid. Tell me again The cause and manner of the massacre; And leisurely. What you related now Seems like a dream, which he that has awaked from't Tries to recall, but finds the substance vapour, Which in the tracing of it—vanishes! You said, the hour of the vespers? Guis. Yes; that hour, That annual hour religiously observed In Sicily, our tyrants made a plea For new and worse aggression. On pretence Our act of piety might mask revolt, Assembling in such numbers; though we held Our warrants in our hands, our wives and children, Which, who that loved them, would to strokes expose From swords and knives in sudden tumult drawn, Where rage might miss a foe and smite a friend? Pro. Well, upon this pretence, orders, you said, Were pass'd to search for arms— Guis. O Heaven, the acts Of an unbridled soldiery—of men Who reckon war a game—regarding all The charities—the tender charities Of human life—as stakes!—Interpreting This order by the hint of most depraved And devilish appetite, the myrmidons Of France presented to amazed Palermo, O'er-acted in her streets, exposure, which Her liberal haunts keep close—attested by The shrieks of maids and matrons, powerless With loathing and affright; whose friends look'd on, Aghast with rage that knew not where to turn. Pro. Go on!—I see it! Guis. Know you one Venoni, The son of Nicolo Venoni? Pro. No; But knew his father well. Guis. He married lately, And his young bride, accompanying him To church, was thus encounter'd. Now Venoni, That kind of spirit is endow'd with, which, If once 'tis chafed, serves its own impulse solely, Reckless of cost. As a high-temper'd horse That's rashly given the spur, throws off all guidance Save that of its own fury; spikes itself Upon a palisade, plunges into A flood, or dashes o'er a precipice As soon as keep the road. With naked hand He struck the caitiff down! Pro. 'Twas like the son Of his father!—'Twas well done! Guis. How one brave man Showing himself will make a thousand brave That play'd the hound before! The miscreant At once was stoned to death. His fellows, seeing, For the first time, how, more from habitude Than proper power, a handful sways a crowd, To save themselves took straight to flight. And now The uproar!—While the guard the larum beat, The citizens—the women and their fry Huddling into their houses, without heed Whether their own or neighbours', and, as freely, Such weapons snapping up as came to hand— Trebled in numbers from the rousing cry Of the exploit, which ran like wildfire through The city, shouting for Enfranchisement, Vengeance, and Freedom, towards the citadel, Devoted, moved—one street of waving arms! Pro. The sight appall'd their enemies! Guis. It did! Pro. No monster half so dire as that which meets The eye of tyranny, when it beholds Its thralls make stand against it, all at once, While at its foot it thought them! They o'erthrew The garrison? Guis. O'erthrew?—Ay, did they, sir, As the red flood of Etna would a wall With touching it. Then came the Massacre, 'Mid yells for quarter, answer'd by despair. The strugglings then—the blows—the kinds of death! Some falling by a single stroke, and some By none at all but grasp of strangling horror. By pieces some despatch'd—gash upon gash— Their bodies hack'd, yet life without a wound. How variously they met their fate—some mad, Some as all sense were lapsed, some seeking it— Some flying from it; and with all the signs As the blood works in such extremity! Some, pale as ashes; some, with face on fire; Some, black as though with premature congealing! Here tears; there scowls; there laughter—yes, I saw Some that did die with laughter! Some did groan, Some groan'd, some shriek'd. Most died with curses. Few With prayers, and they were mix'd with imprecations. More than one wretch, thrust through and through, that laugh'd With simulated bravery, masking despair! Not one encounter'd death with constancy; But most as, to its pangs, were superadded The sharper stings of conscience. Pro. Heaven have mercy Upon their souls! Guis. Their wives and children, now— Pro. Don't tell me that again! I shudder still! The work of slaughter should have stopp'd at them! Woman and infancy have Nature's word Against the blows of men, whom she made strong For their protection! It is damage done, Irreparable to a righteous cause; Which, else, all men, contemporary with it, As well as all to come, had wholly lauded. It is a glorious page in history, So blotted, men will say of it, hereafter, As well as now, “Better it ne'er were written!” Guis. Nay, John of Procida, that friend whose zeal Despatch'd me to you, and your trust in whom Made him the master of your hiding-place— For, it behoved you, being what you are, The friend of Sicily, like a wild beast To house!—that friend, with other thoughts than yours Beheld the work of vengeance. In the midst His voice was loudest, “Death to all that's French! Spare not—nor sex—nor age!” Pro. I love the zeal, But hate the excess. Guis. Think 'twas the lava, sir; And had it been, what then would you have said? But, that it was the hand of Heaven, stretch'd forth, Most righteously. For when was mercy shown, To us or ours, by them? To say no more, Our sisters, wives, and daughters, with their cheeks Burning at shames, which, thought of, drives us mad, Cried for atonement not one tittle short Of that which we exacted! Be prepared. Palermo marches on Messina. Not A minute but she's nearer, by the strides Impatient vengeance takes, with first success, Flush'd and invigorated! You are look'd for, As soul and limb of the enterprise. Beware, The fire you wish to blaze, you put not out, By damping it. For me, my sword abstains From nothing that owns kindred with the blood Whose pestilent poison, worse than pestilence, Has cursed my native land! Look to yourself, Fernando! [Rushes out.] Pro. By that name they call my son! Is he devoted? Friend!—No! Let me think! No; better I remove him from the rage I might in vain attempt to mitigate; They shall depart together. Who goes there? Francisco? Enter Francisco [a Sailor]. Fran. Yes. Pro. You keep your time. Where lies The boat? Fran. In the shade of yonder jutting rock On which the moonbeam strikes. Pro. 'Tis well. When those, With whom I mean to freight her, shall arrive, I'll summon you; when they are safe bestow'd, Pull for the fleet, right to the Admiral's ship. Away and watch. [Francisco goes.] Nature forebodes a shock. She is not herself, but motionless and still, Like one that holds his breath with strong suspense! Etna seems dead, as though her fires were out. At morn, I watch'd her; and, again, at noon; At sunset, last; I could not see a reek; No, not so much as the light gauzy wreath Shook from the veil which vaporous night hath left, And morning, lifting with his glowing hand, Melts, as he touches, into viewless air! Charybdis holds her peace and Scylla sleeps! The welkin does not stir! A heaviness, Stillness, and silence, all unwonted, and Portentous, hold possession of the world As on the eve of some dread prodigy! Fernando and Isoline enter. Fern. Who is there? Pro. A friend. Fern. My father? Pro. Yes, my son. You are come in time. Methinks not yet the moon Has topp'd the hill of night. How is it, lady? You seem to droop? Iso. 'Tis very sultry, sir. I never felt the like. There's not a breath. Pro. No; not a breath, indeed. 'Tis a deep calm. Wilt trust me, lady, as a friend? Iso. I will! As better than a friend—a father, sir— The father of my husband!—By that title In a brief hour almost as much endear'd As he who call'd me daughter all my life! Pro. A most sweet nature! Slaughter shall not force The house of such a heart. Fernando! Fern. Sir? Pro. Anon a storm will burst upon Messina More fierce than ever yet the elements In wildest fury bred. Do you see a cloud? Fern. No. Pro. Understand me, then. Fern. I understand you! Pro. It brings no squall, no bolt, yon fleet need fear. There you shall house to-night—your bride as well. Fern. My father— Pro. Peace!—Believe I love you, lady; Not that I say so, but that I will show you The deeds of love. Behoves it, though, at present, You give me credit on my word alone, And largely, too. Iso. To what amount you will. Provided, should you fail—and that, I am sure, Would be the shame of fortune and not yours,— My losses only light upon myself! Pro. 'Tis frankly answer'd. Frankly, then, thus far Give me your confidence on trust, alone, To change, to-night, your lodging for a berth On board a barque that rides in yonder fleet, Whereof the chief bears me a brother's love, Which I, alike, return. Hard by, there waits A boat, and he that holds your hand e'en now, And has most right to it of all the world, Shall go along with you. Fern. O father, thanks! Iso. For what, dear husband? Those were hearty thanks! Such payment waits not on small benefits. What heavy debt do you and I incur By sleeping, love, on board yon fleet to-night, That you acknowledge it so largely? Fern. Nay! Question not, sweet! but come! Iso. Nay; by your leave, I'll think, a little, first. The thanks you pay Mind me of thanks which I myself do owe And ought to pay as well as you.—Did we lodge With a mere friend—a friend of every day— The common'st friend—we would not leave his house Without “Good-bye and thank you.” I have lived With a good friend of mine for twenty years— One that still made me feel his house my own; As welcome to it every bit as much As he himself!—Should I treat such a friend Worse than I would a friend of every day? No, love.—I'll go.—But you and I must bid “Good-bye and thank you” to my father first. Pro. [Aside.] That note now jars the tune that late ran sweet! Iso. What is't offends your father, that he frowns And moves with step disturb'd? What angers him? I see! I see!—I must return to mine. Fern. It may not be! Iso. Nay, by your leave, it must! And say it must, dear love! Oh, make me not The thing I would not be—a froward wife. 'Tis time enough for that—if e'er that come, Which, I'll be bound, 'twill never, with my will. I would not for a thousand thousand worlds Gainsay you, any time, and chiefly now, Just when I have paid my freedom down for you. Oh, be a gentle master to me, love! Don't overtask me, lest the duty, which 'Twere sweetness to discharge, grows weariness, And I should cast the heavy burden down I lack the strength to bear. Fern. This once be ruled! Only this once, and I'll obey you, love, For all my life to come! Give you command, And try to overtask me, if you will, And see if I complain—much less, rebel. Bear with me only now! Iso. I will not, love, Unless I know the reason; and when known, Approve of it! Husband, deal fair with me. Is't fit I do the thing my soul condemns? How may it fare with you? Is she a wife Who, as a daughter, fails? She cannot be! Duty is uniform where duty is, Clif. Reverse of fortune, lady, changes friends; It turns them into strangers. What I am I have not always been! Julia. Could I not name you? Clif. If your disdain for one, perhaps too bold When hollow fortune call'd him favourite,— Now by her fickleness perforce reduced To play an humbler part, would suffer you— Julia. I might? Clif. You might! Julia. Oh, Clifford! is it you? Clif. Your answer to my lord. [Gives the letter. Julia. Your lord! [Mechanically taking it. Clif. Wilt write it? Or, will it please you send a verbal one? I'll bear it faithfully. Julia. You'll bear it? Clif. Madam, Your pardon, but my haste is somewhat urgent. My lord's impatient, and to use despatch Were his repeated orders. Julia. Orders? Well, I'll read the letter, sir. 'Tis right you mind His lordship's orders. They are paramount! Nothing should supersede them!—stand beside them! They merit all your care, and have it! Fit, Most fit they should! Give me the letter, sir. Clif. You have it, madam. Julia. So! How poor a thing I look! so lost, while he is all himself! Have I no pride? [She rings, the Servant enters. Paper, and pen, and ink! If he can freeze, 'tis time that I grow cold! I'll read the letter. [Opens it, and holds it as about to read it. Mind his orders! So! Quickly he fits his habits to his fortunes! He serves my lord with all his will! His heart's In his vocation. So! Is this the letter? 'Tis upside down—and here I'm poring on't! Most fit I let him see me play the fool! Shame. Let me be myself! [A Servant enters with materials for writing. A table, sir, And chair. [The Servant brings a table and chair, and goes out. She sits awhile, vacantly gazing on the letter—then looks at Clifford. How plainly shows his humble suit! It fits not him that wears it! I have wrong'd him! He can't be happy—does not look it!—is not. That eye which reads the ground is argument Enough! He loves me. There I let him stand, And I am sitting! [Rises, takes a chair, and approaches Clifford. Pray you take a chair. [He bows, as acknowledging and declining the honour. She looks at him awhile. Clifford, why don't you speak to me? [She weeps. Clif. I trust You're happy. Julia. Happy! Very, very happy! You see I weep, I am so happy! Tears Are signs, you know, of nought but happiness! When first I saw you, little did I look To be so happy!—Clifford! Clif. Madam? Julia. Madam! I call thee Clifford, and thou call'st me madam! Clif. Such the address my duty stints me to. Thou art the wife elect of a proud earl, Whose humble secretary, now, am I. Julia. Most right! I had forgot! I thank you, sir, For so reminding me; and give you joy, That what, I see, had been a burthen to you, Is fairly off your hands. Clif. A burthen to me! Mean you yourself? Are you that burthen, Julia? Say that the sun 's a burthen to the earth! Say that the blood 's burthen to the heart! Say health 's a burthen, peace, contentment, joy, Fame, riches, honours! everything that man Desires, and gives the name of blessing to!— E'en such a burthen, Julia were to me, Had fortune let me wear her. Julia. [Aside.] On the brink Of what a precipice I'm standing! Back, Back! while the faculty remains to do't! A minute longer, not the whirlpool's self More sure to suck me down! One effort! There! [She returns to her seat, recovers her self-possession, takes up the letter, and reads. To wed to-morrow night! Wed whom? A man Whom I can never love! I should before Have thought of that! To-morrow night! This hour To-morrow! How I tremble! Happy bands To which my heart such freezing welcome gives, As sends an ague through me! At what means Will not the desperate snatch! What's honour's price? Nor friends, nor lovers,—no, nor life itself! Clifford! This moment leave me! [Clifford retires up the stage out of Julia's sight. Is he gone! O docile lover! Do his mistress' wish And can no more with disobedience bide Than honesty with fraud. Am I not right? Am I the guardian of your honour, love? Ay, before any one!—before yourself! Then, by myself, must I approve the trust, And make fidelity my law in all things. I'll see my father ere I seek yon fleet, Or know the reason why I must not see him, And find that reason right. Pro. Yet more and more It turns to discords!—Girl! your husband's life Depends on your obeying him. Iso. Does mine? Pro. Yes. Iso. And my father's, too?—I'll answer—No! I comprehend. Some storm that's gathering Around my father, you would save me from; And, to that end, would lead me to forsake him. Forsake my father!—Sir, are you a father To counsel so a child? Is this the ruin You told me of, and would have left me to, Fernando?—but you did not leave me!—No!— You were mine own love still! Sir, have you rule Over the wind that brings this thunder-cloud, Divert it! Think how merciful is Heaven, And copy it! My father is your foe, But spare him—I spared you! Pro. I would return Your bounty, would you let me. Iso. Could I let you, On terms like yours, I were unworthy of it! Plead for my father! Will you not, Fernando? Do it!—He was a father, love, to you! Pro. Do it, and think upon your mother, boy! Are you a man?—The boat lies round the rock; There stands your wife; destruction is at hand. Seize her and snatch her from it! Iso. If he dares! 'Twould make me hate him!—Yes, Fernando—love Can turn to e'en as opposite a thing As hate!—ay, in a moment!—Do not try it! Pro. Listen, and learn the fate that threatens you, And I would save you from! The men that were But yesterday the spaniels of the French, To-day are bloodhounds that eat up their masters. Palermo knows it! Of thy country, all, That late drew breath in her, have proved it—Man Woman, and Child! The rule is Massacre! And now the dogs, mad with the game of blood, Hark hither to repeat it.—There they are! Iso. Where? Pro. Don't you hear? Iso. I do!—a distant sound. Pro. It is their yelping as they speed along On foam with haste and fury. Save your wife! Iso. Fernando, touch your wife and she's a corpse! Make but the offer and she slays herself! Which is the way?—Point out the way to me— The way to my father!—Sirs, which is the way? Pro. They'll intercept you ere you reach the town! Iso. Were it the lava that came boiling on, I'd cross it to my father! Pro. You forget Your husband! Iso. He is safe—my father not: I now am wife to danger! Fern. Isoline! Iso. Ha!—Yes!—There 'tis!—That light—O blessed light! Blest though 'tis shining from a tomb!—I greet it As never did I yet the rising sun. [Rushes out. Pro. [Stopping Fernando.] Whither, my boy? Fern. Father, to bring her back, Or share her fate! Pro. Fernando! Fern. Better die Than live—and, honour dead—nay, manhood dead— Still bear thy name, living of all mankind The execration! Farewell, father! Pro. Stop! Embrace me ere you go! Fern. [Struggling with Procida.] Nay, father! Pro. Nay, But I will hold thee, boy! Fern. She vanishes! I have lost sight of her!—O, loose thy hold! Pro. I cannot part with thee! Fern. She will escape me! Pro. What! is my strength gone from me?—Is my child Stronger than I?—Can I believe I have dwindled While he has grown to brawn! Fern. [Bursting away.] Farewell! Pro. He is gone! And I am desolate in the world again! O, the fine nature, there, that's run to waste! Hark!—They are near the town.—Why, Procida, Where is thy cause?—that which was wife, son, all On earth most dear to thee? Who roused the spirit That leads the march of death in progress, now? Thou!—Where thy post then?—Here, or at its head, Directing it? Forgive me, Sicily, Forgive me, martyr-king!—and, Liberty, Disown me not; I ever was thy son! Away the private care! The public cause Engross the heart, I once gave up to it, And now give up again! Quail, Tyranny! Up, Freedom!—Claim your rights—and have them, too! [Goes off. SCENE II. —A Chamber in the Castle. Loud knocking outside, repeated two or three times. Enter from the opposite side Ambrose hastily. Amb. Give o'er!—What makes you knock so loud? Come in! [Opens. Louis. [Entering.] The Governor! Amb. He sleeps. Louis. Awaken him! Amb. Must I?—Till now he has not tasted rest; His mind distemper'd by unquiet thoughts, Things of no substance—visions, which his fancy Has conjured up to cheat his senses with. Gazing on air, as 'twere endued with form, Sinews and motion; and with silence holding Discourse, as it could hear, and had a tongue; Sleep hath but new composed him; I am loth To abridge her friendly visit. Louis. Better thou Than death! Messina swarms on every hand With signs of ferment. Ere the custom'd hour, The citizens forsake their couches, for The scarcely lighted streets; and frequent pass From house to house, or here and there in groups Stand muttering to one another; while On our patrols, for whom they scarce make way, Instead of looks of deprecation, scowls They cast, that talk of blood as openly As threats of murder. Something is on foot Which instant harsh example may suppress, Whereto we wait the will of the Governor. Amb. I'll call him then,—Soft,—he is here! Observe, Attired as yesterday, rejecting all The appliances of sleep! Gov. [Entering.] I am the dupe Of mine own fancy, and I know it; yet I am its dupe! My reason giveth way. I come from my own chamber, where I stood Just now in the hall of John of Procida! I knew 'twas my own chamber, yet it seem'd His hall; and at the further end there sat His wife, or else a spectre in her shape. She did not breathe, methought, and yet she sat Her chair erect, and saw; and glared at me Until her eyeballs froze me. I come out Into my antechamber. I am here!— I am sure I am!—Still seem I standing yet In that abhorréd hall with that companion Of aspect most unnatural, that makes My flesh to creep and breathing grow so thick I doubt 'tis air I draw! Louis. He dreams, although He seems awake. Amb. No—no!—He does not dream! It is not dreams men see with open eyes. This mood hath grown upon him since he heard Of John of Procida. My lord—my lord! Gov. O, Ambrose, is it you? I am glad you are here. Amb. I am, my lord; and here is Louis too, Who dreads some ferment in Messina. Scarce 'Tis dawn, and yet the citizens have left Their beds, and throng the streets with sullen looks, Threatening disaster to their masters, which To avert, behoves we force them to keep house, And make, of the resisting, sharp example. Gov. Take measures as occasion calls for them, Arouse the garrison. Let one and all Be under arms. Shed no more blood than's needed. [Louis goes out. No news of John of Procida! The face He saw not; 'twas the figure only struck him; Recalling the impression of a man He once had seen, but where he could not tell, Nor who it was, till he at last bethought him Of John of Procida, then told his thought Not as a thing of doubt but certainty. And then the disappearance all at once Of him he so remark'd, was circumstance Corroborative. Ever since, my heart Hath felt a chill like that the body feels When cold hath smit it to the bone! so deep, No art medicinal can draw it out, And the wretch shivers at the very fire! Amb. He is forgetful I am near him. Mark. Gov. Hangs then my fate on John of Procida? My heart forebodes it does. Forebodes it right? If so, when he's at hand, my doom is near. Ha! as I live 'tis gone. Spectre and all! O! now I see you, Ambrose. Who comes yonder? Is't not Le Clerc? Amb. I'd say it was, my lord, But for those marks of blood! He spent last night Some two miles distant from Messina. Enter Le Clerc, supported by Martel and a Soldier. Martel. Here's Le Clerc come wounded home. He threw himself From his horse into our arms, and without word, Made for the staircase, which he stagger'd up, As if by superhuman effort, and Made straight for your highness' chamber. Gov. Well, Le Clerc? What would you with me, friend? What has befallen you? He strives to speak, but cannot. Voice is fled, And life is following it. One word, Le Clerc. He dies in the attempt.—Yes; he is dead! Remove him. Good Martel, be on the alert. Arouse our friends. Look to the citizens! [Martel and the others go out, bearing the body between them. Of some dread visitation this must be The dark, but sure, forerunner. Death is abroad. Be sure of it. Yes, Ambrose, death is abroad! Death!—Death! Louis. [Entering hastily.] My lord, the sentinels upon The walls hear sounds as of a multitude Advancing on Messina. Scouts are sent; What it behoves us look for, we shall learn A few brief minutes hence Gov. Brief, do you say? Years are not brief, and minutes now are years! What of the citizens? Louis. Their numbers swell. They move in masses up and down the city, Returning dogged silence to our orders To clear the streets. We wait for augmentation To drive them into their houses. List, my lord, Our trumpets sound to arms. Enter François, conducting Pierre, much exhausted. Gov. Ay, lustily They tell their need. What other spectre this? Who is't? He is ours, and yet I know him not. Who is't, I say? Fran. One from Palermo, sir, Whose speed has cost him his good courser's life To bring unwelcome news. Gov. What tells it, friend? Pierre. The massacre of every living soul Of Gallic birth or blood, that in Palermo Drew breath the day on which I 'scaped from it, Preserved by feigning death! Martel. [Rushing in.] A whelming flood— A whelming human flood—comes raging on Right for Messina. Haste, sirs! Massacre Is at our very gates. Flight is cut off. Resistance is our only hope. Forth!—Forth! Houses are certain tombs! [All go out but the Governor, who seems transfixed. Gov. 'Tis Procida! 'Tis Vengeance!—Vengeance without mercy!—fierce!— Implacable! On every side the sword! I cannot hope to live—yet cannot die! Flight—flight—the coward's refuge! Nothing else Is left me! This way leads into the street! The garden? Yes, it opes without the walls; Conscience, 'tis thou, not I!—Except for thee I would not quail!—The spectre here again! Again the hall of John of Procida! Away!—Flight!—Nothing else!—Away!—Away! [Rushes out. SCENE THE LAST. —The Garden of the Castle. Enter Isoline, tottering and breathless—She leans against a tree—Sounds of tumult without, and the noise of martial instruments. Iso. Thus far in time—thus far in safety! Were't Another stride, ere take it I had dropp'd. The work is going on! O, spare my father— Spare him, and deal with me! Hark! Massacre Has left this quarter free; within the city Holding her gory reign. She does not riot Within the castle yet. He yet may live! Limbs, hold me up. Don't fail me. Who comes here? My father!—Father! [Governor enters hastily and wildly. Gov. Whosoe'er thou art, Stop not my way! Iso. Dost thou not know me? Gov. No! In times like these men know not one another. Holding together, they together fall, As men in knots will drown. In scattering lies The chance of safety. Do not hold me, friend! Let go!—Look to thyself!—Let every one Look to himself. He is lost that casts his eye Upon another's jeopardy. His own Asks all his care.—Let go!—Away!—Away! [Rushes off. Iso. [Thrown upon her knees.] He does not know me!—He's my father, and He does not know me! He's distracted—mad! Fain would I follow him, but cannot.—No, My knees refuse to raise me. Fern. [Rushing in.] Isoline! Iso. [Springing up by a convulsive effort, and throwing herself into his arms.] Fernando!—my Fernando!—True to death! My husband—Mine own love!—I die for joy! And bless thee, my Fernando, for my death! [Swoons in his arms Fern. Love!—Wife!—Choice pattern of thy devoted sex— My Isoline! She is dead!—she is dead!—she is dead! Guis. [Entering from the castle, his sword drawn.] Fernando! Fern. Here, Guiscardo! Guis. Who is she Hangs swooning on thine arm? Thy bride? Fern. My bride! Guis. And dead? Fern. And dead! Guis. Set down the carrion, then, And yield me payment for Martini's death! I want not odds!—I'll fight thee like a man For ancient friendship's sake! Fern. Fight me, Guiscardo? Guis. Cast down thy load to earth, and draw thy sword. Fern. Wouldst murder me?—and if thou wouldst, Guiscardo, Do it at once! Guis. I'd treat thee like a man. Wilt thou not throw thyself thy burden down, And act like one, or must I wrest it from thee To balk thee of excuse? [Approaching. Fern. You touch her not! 'Fore her dead body do I throw my life That would not save my own! Guis. Have at thee, then! [They fight; Fernando is wounded. And. [Rushing in.] Hold!—'Tis the son of John of Procida! Guis. The son of John of Procida! Fern. Too late!— Take her! Preserve from insult—Pay all honours,— For her sake, not for mine, and lay us side By side. I pant for death, and not the life, Would hold my spirit from rejoining hers! [Dies. Enter John of Procida. Pro. It is not there!—I came to see his corse, But not to smite him. No!—I would not stain This day of freedom with the narrow deed Of personal vengeance.—To the swords of others I would have left him, satisfied if they The debt exacted that was due to mine. But they, intent on their own quarry, mine Have suffer'd to escape, and vengeance, now Balk'd, by its own remissness, of its prey, Gnashes the teeth in vain! And. Di Procida! Pro. Ho!—Andrea! What bear'st thou on thy arm? And. The body of Fernando's wife, although If this be death, I much mistake its hue! Pro. Who lies upon the ground? The Governor? And. Thy son, O Procida!—She is not dead! Help here!—Hold off!—You kill'd him! Pro. Kill'd my son! Guis. Strike, John of Procida! He sided with The enemies of Sicily. Pro. He did; And he was born her son! Live!—You did right. His father says it.—Yet, he was my son! Guis. I knew not that. Pro. And had you known it, still You had done right—I say it—I—his father! And yet he was my son! Iso. [Recovering.] My lord!—My husband!— Fernando!—draw me closer to thy breast! Hold off!—Who art thou?—Where's Fernando?—Who Is that? And. Fernando's father! Iso. So it is! And we are safe!—Art we not, sir? [Tottering toward John. Pro. O, Fate! Iso. You will not let them murder us?—You will not! You can't! else Nature have no truth in her, And never more be trusted!—Never more! If fathers will not stretch an arm to save Their children's throats, let mothers' breasts run dry, And infants at the very founts of life Be turn'd to stones! Sir!—Father!—Where's your son? Ah, you repulse me not! You let me come Closer to you.—Where's my Fernando, father? What! do you draw me to you?—Would you take me Into your very bosom?—There, then! [Throws her arms about his neck. Now, Fernando, what's to fear?—Now, mine own love, We shall be happy!—happy!—blessed happy! Why don't you answer me?—Where is he, father? I left him here! Where I have been I know not. I recollect a sickness as of death, And now it comes again. My brow grows chill And damp—I'll wipe it! Blood!—What brings it here? Whose blood is this? And. Blood has been shed to-day. No vestment in Messina, but you'll find Some trace upon't. Iso. Where is my husband, sirs? Is this Fernando's blood?—We were together, And it was here!—and if death threaten'd us, He would be close to me, of his own life Making a shield for mine! Was he alive, Were he not here?—Not here, he must be dead! And this must be his blood! Pro. Remove her, friend; Take and remove her hence. I lack the strength. Her plight, to mine own added, weighs me down. She must not see his body; 'tis her life That I feel fluttering next my breast just now As ready to take wing. 'Twere certain death To look upon him. Iso. [To Andrea.] No, I will not hence! They will murder me. I am safe here,—am I not? Am I not, father? Father!—Where's my father? He did not know me!—Shook off his daughter! Fled from her!—You are all my father now! But there's Fernando, too!—You are not weeping? You are!—Don't weep!—I'll dry your eyes for you! The blood again! Pro. We must remove her hence. Come with me, child. Iso. Child!—Do you call me child? Child is a sweet name! Pro. Come, my daughter. Iso. Daughter! That's sweeter yet than child. Nothing so sweet After the name of wife; but wife's not sweeter Than husband.—Husband? That's the sweetest name Of all! My husband is your son! and “son”— There is a sweet name too!—No sweeter name Than son! Do you not think so? Pro. Come. Iso. I come! We are going to Fernando,—are we not? Sir, fare you well. What's that upon the ground? And. Where? Iso. There! You know as well as I! Stand off! [Breaks away. Fernando!—My Fernando! Dead?—Ay, dead Indeed, when it is I that call, and thou Return'st no answer!—My Fernando!—Dead! Ah! it is well! Here's silence coming too For me, love!—Yes, I feel the frost of death Biting my limbs, and creeping towards my heart. Colder and colder—all will soon be ice. 'Tis winter ere its time! but welcome, since 'Tis shared with you, Fernando. Mercy, Heaven, 'Tis kind—'tis pitiful to suffer me On thy dead lips to breathe my life away. [Dies. And. Let me conduct thee hence, O Procida! Grief hath benumb'd his every faculty. Steph. [Entering with others.] Where is John of Procida? And. Behold him. Steph. Health To thee and to Messina! which, to-day, Through thee, beholds her grievous yoke thrown off. All Sicily is free! From north to south, From east to west she garrisons herself, And tyrants rule no more! And. Forgive him that He heeds you not. The body is his son's, You see him gazing on! Steph. We know his heart! Thomaso. [Entering with others.] Health, John of Procida! The enemy That sack'd thy castle, and who yesterday Held rule in Sicily, the Governor, Flying from death, encounter'd it from one Who knew him, intercepted him, and slew him. And. All enmities, all loves, are swallow'd up In the deep gulf of sorrow for his son. Carlo. [Entering with others.] Where is our chief? And. You see what's left of him. Carlo. The admiral And captains of the fleet have disembark'd To swell the general joy; and, yonder, come Our ancient magistrates, their offices Suspended long, resumed, to pay their debts To John of Procida! Enter Magistrates, &amp;c. Chief Magistrate. Di Procida The Liberator—so we hail thee—such Thy deeds declare thee better than our words! For us and for our children from our hands— Whose act our sovereign master will approve— Most poor return take for most rich desert, And be the Governor of Sicily! [The whole assembly shout and applaud—John of Procida weeps. Pro. Forgive me—I'm a father—There's my son! END OF JOHN OF PROCIDA.</field>
