      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —The Danish Camp. Enter Edith with a bow and quiver, followed by Ina attended by a Boy, who carries a bow and quiver. Edith. Come, let us try who'll hit the target first. Ina. My bow hath got a cast, and will not shoot. Edith. In sooth your bow hath got no cast at all, 'Tis true as mine. Take mine—I'll shoot with it. Ina. Yours fits me not—'tis harder far to draw. Edith. Try it. Ina. No, no; I will not shoot to-day. Besides, my arrows all have lost the nock Edith. Here's store enough of mine. Ina. Good Edith, no! Entreat me not—I will not shoot to-day. Edith. Why, so 'twas yesterday! Fie, Ina, fie! To tax thy bow with fault it never had. The bow that hath a cast is thy changed will, Thy nockless shafts are marr'd alone by that. You wont to love this sport! From morn till night Your pastime 'twas, and now you love it not! What love you, sweet, instead? Ina. What should I love? Edith. Nay, Ina—you alone can answer that. Has Otho's suit prevail'd? Ina. When did a flower Spring from a weed, that love should grow from hate? Edith. What! call you love a flower? A flower looks gay— So looks not love! A flower is sweet—Who says That love is sweet? Does sweetness garner pain For those that own it? Rather love's a weed Oft taken for a flower—found out at last With a sigh! O, Ina, you have pluck'd this weed! Come, own it, Ina! Ina. Wherefore do you look Thus at me? Edith. Why do you, my Ina, look At anything but me? Why do your eyes Of late their lustre lavish on the ground, That cares not for it? And your honey'd breath, That should be given to your silver tongue To make sweet music of, why do you waste Oftener on thankless and contentless sighs? Come, tell me, Ina, what has happen'd to you? Ina. Alas! I know not. Edith. Do you say alas! O, then, 'tis over with you! Why, you're in tears; Only the drop's but half-way out, that soon Would make way for the rest, held not your eye Its crystal door upon it! Lean your head Upon the bosom of your friend, and give Your secret vent—for sure you have one, Ina! Ina. Not I!—Come, take your bow!—I'll shoot with you! My quiver 'gainst a shaft, I'll be the first To hit the mark. Set up the target, boy! [Boy goes out. Now for the eye of the eye. [Shoots.] In sooth I've miss'd, Wide by a mile—but thou hast shot full home! I've pluck'd it, Edith, flower or weed. If weed, O! weed most like a flower.—O precious weed! There's not a flower so fair, I'd deem thee graced To call thee by its name! Boy [running in]. The battle 's won! I see our troops come winding up the glen, Their spears and banners wreath'd—a token, sure, Of victory. [Goes out. Edith. Let's meet them, Ina:—Come! Why, sweet, what's this? How pale you turn! How damp's Your little hand! Nay, now 'tis snow indeed. Cold as 'tis white! Did you not rightly hear? He says the battle's won! Ina. I know he does! Edith. Is't with such cheeks you listen to such news? This would become the daughter of the foe. Ina. The foe! The foe! Edith. What! find'st thou something sweet In that harsh word, that thou repeat'st it thus? Ina. Harsh word! Now, harsh art thou to call it so; Jars it thine ear? There's music in't to mine! Stands it for what thou'dst shun? that's what I'd seek! Yea! 'fore the things that brother, sister, friend— Soft titles—stand for! Ina loves a foe! That foe has lost the battle we have won. Edith. Why, sweet, where sawest thou this gentle foe? Ina. Even here. When last the Saxon ask'd a truce, Curious to see their herald, I remain'd Behind you in my father's tent. He came! O, with what grace of rarest manhood! Proud His gait, yet bearing onwards grace, so bland, As made all hearts give willing way to him. He spake, and I took root to where I stood; And so did all. Not Guthrum moved! O Edith, How should it be with Ina? Where were her eyes? What were her ears about? What did her heart? Dost feel it throbbing now? 'Tis quiet, now, To what 'twas then! How often have you tried To fix your naked eye upon the sun; And when you've ta'en it off, how has the day, From gazing his bright face, been turn'd to night; Flowers, verdure, darken'd; yea, the orb himself From burning gold, grown ink. 'Twas so with me When sight of him was gone! Night turn'd to day Again with you—but light's gone out with Ina E'er since the day she look'd upon her foe! Edith. Hence, Ina, hence awhile! your father comes; He must find looks of welcome. Ina. Have with you. You've won my secret, Edith! Guard it for me. [They go out. Enter Guthrum, Amund, Oscar, Haldane, and Danes. Guth. Halt, comrades, halt! and change your toil for rest, And then from rest to feasting! We'll carouse A moon for this last victory, that leaves No future foe to front us. England 's won! So thinn'd her sons by this last overthrow, And utterly discomfited, enow Remain her not to make another stand, Durst Alfred rally them—their throneless king! We shall not need to cross the main again To prop us with fresh succours. Here we'll build Another Danish kingdom, fairer far Than what we've left! What, ho there! bring me wine! I'm thirsty from our march. Ho! wine, I say! A seat! Here, in the open air, we'll drink, Or ere we part, to our new Denmark. Chief And followers shall pledge me. Wine I say! Enter Otho. Otho. Guthrum, your priests prepare a sacrifice. The God expects his victims. Shall he have them? Guth. Take them! You know the God must have his due! [Otho goes out. Give him the wine! my thirst's gone off—yet, no; 'Tis fit that I drink first. [Drinks.] To our new Denmark! By Odin! 'twas a glorious victory! The God deserves his victims—he shall have them! Odin's the God of war! If he drinks blood, He has a right. Who dares deny the God His victims? Amund, take the cup! We fought Like Odin's sons. I saw you, Amund, cleave In twain a Saxon at a single blow. Am. My Lord, 'twas slight to what your falchion did, That, through the casquéd head and mailéd chine, Made way at one dire wheel! Guth. Ay, did it so? I do believe it did! No more of that! Give me your hand, good Amund—For that blow Lord of a gallant castle shalt thou be. Pass on the cup to Oscar. Oscar! ha! Show me thy falchion's edge—Look, Amund, here— I saw him keep at once five Saxon swords At bay! Well done!—Oscar, be sure you sit On my right hand at banquet. Osc. Mighty chief, I mark'd your eye was on me! 'twas a sword That more than balanced all the odds against me! Besides, your arm, just then, had turn'd the fight, That seem'd at first against us. Guth. Was it so? I don't remember it. Good Oscar, ask What portion of the spoil thou wilt—'tis thine! Otho re-enters. Otho. The victims, Chief, are ready. Guth. So! enough! Otho. Eight of them did we take by lot. The ninth Is self-devoted to preserve the life Of one, to whom we were about to hold The fatal urn. Guth. Indeed! a chief? Otho. The port Of both bespeaks them men of proud degree. Guth. Have 'em before us; we would see them. [Otho goes out.] Guthrum Loves war! Would leave the banquet any time To mingle in the fight. He loves a friend; But more than friend's embrace, he loves the hug Foe gives to foe. Yet is not Guthrum cruel! His foe disarm'd he never yet could smite! He likes a noble deed, although the sword Achieves it not. How say you, friends, were't right To save the man, who loves his friend so well, He lays down life for him—although a gift To Odin? Am. Ere the priest his sacred hand Lays on the victim, it has, still, been lawful To snatch him from his doom! Hal. Behoves him though To swear eternal league with Odin's sons. Guth. He'll do it, Haldane! Ha! I saw thee match'd In fight, for once. That Saxon found thee, Haldane, With two that back'd thee, livelier work than suits A sluggard's hand. Thy seconds both were down— Was't not so, Haldane?—and thyself, methought, Madest rather backward way, when I despatch'd Fresh aid to thee, with charge, at any risk, To take thy gallant foe alive. 'Twas you, Oscar, that I so charged. Osc. My liege, he lives; O'ercome by force that could not make him yield, But bore him down to earth, where, as he lay, The strife his fetter'd limbs were forced to drop; His eye continued still, that shot around Deadly defiance in the face of death. Guth. Foe worthy Guthrum's sword! Was't not the herald, Last sent us from the English king? Osc. The same. Guth. I'd like to see that man, again! Osc. He's here. Enter Otho, with Oswith and Edric chained. Guth. This he!—Men's looks reflect their deeds as well As nature's. One of these is he, whose thought Of lofty friendship overlooks himself, When fix'd on his friend's need—This is the man! Otho. It is, my Lord. Guth. Is he thy friend, whose life Thou count'st a thing so precious, thou wouldst give Thine own to purchase it? Os. He is. Guth. What rich And heavy debt hast thou incurr'd to him, To pay so large return as takes thy all? Os. And think'st thou friendship barters kindnesses? 'Tis not because that such or such a time He help'd my purse, or stood me thus or thus In stead, that I go bound for him, or take His quarrel up! With friends, all services Are ever gifts, that glad the donor most! Who rates them otherwise, he only takes The face of friend to mask a usurer. I give my life for him, not for the service He did me yesterday, or any day, But for the love I bear him every day, Nor ask if he returns! Guth. Be Guthrum's friend, Thou livest, and thy friend for sake of thee! Edr. O, generous proffer! Os. Wouldst accept it? Edr. Yes. Os. Then do. Guth. Remove their chains. Os. First take off his. Guth. Now thine! Os. Long as my country wears your chains, Guthrum, beware how you unrivet mine; For once you set my arm at liberty, The thing which first 'twill seek will be a sword, To right my master, royal Alfred's cause— And hack my injured country's fetters off! Guth. Saxon, beware! The smooth and gentle tide Of mercy thwarted, turns a torrent, oft O'erwhelming as the raging flood itself Of vengeance! Os. Here I stand—let it come down! I care not when or where its fury rushes! Enter Ina and Edith (as yet unperceived by Guthrum, &amp;c.). Ina. [Aside to Edith.] 'Tis he! Guth. Is Guthrum braved!—Is he the son Of Odin!—marches, in his van, the God Of War!—lies o'er the humbled necks of hosts Of prostrate foes his path; and brooks he thus Defiance, and from one earth-sprung—the spawn Of the vile clod he treads on! Stood thy king Alfred, of whom thou vaunting spokest, stood he Where now thou stand'st, his regal eye had fallen Beneath the frown of Guthrum. Os. Not beneath The frown of Guthrum's god, were Odin real As he is fabled! Guth. Give him to the God! Ina. Father! Guth. My Ina! Os. Ha! could I believe He was not born of earth—there were, indeed, An argument could make me! Guth. I have given thee Thy choice of life or death—thou choosest death; Then take it. Ina. Father! Guth. Ah, thou ever art My sweet and welcome calm, that glads me, sun-like, When summer days are breathless with the joy Of his enriching beam.—I'm smooth again! Not a ruffle! not a ruffle!—Is he not gone? Hence with him! Ina. No, no, my father! Guth. Wouldst thou have me set A-foam again!—Nay, Ina, if I rage, 'Tis not at thee!—Why start away from me? Come back, and cling to me again! close, close! My child, beloved and only, tell me, if Thou canst, how much I love thee! Otho. Saxon, come. Ina. No, no! Guth. How, Ina! Ina. Thou didst not repeat Thy order. Guth. But I will. Ina. O, speak to me!— I'm glad the fight is o'er. You won it soon! You won it safely, else it were not won! How stood the plume I fasten'd on your crest? Well! well! How many eyes were on that plume, Tossing, as proud it rode the stormy wave Of battle; still the more majestical, The fiercer wax'd the swell! Guth. My child, my child! Ay, every inch my own.—When thou wast born, I wish'd a son. I would not give thee now For troops of them!—What, Otho!— Ina. Your scarf!—Is't whole? No, no, a rent is here! Come, take it off. False as it is, you shall not wear't again! I'll knit you another, every loop of which I'll fasten with a spell, that it shall prove An amulet against the thrust of spear, Or stroke of falchion! Guth. So you shall! You make A child of your father! Otho! Ina. Not a wound! For ever in the thickest of the fight, And not a wound! Thank Odin! Yet I would There were a slight one—for the 'tending on't! No! no! and yet in sooth I would there were! I know not what I say! I prate! I prate! Thank Odin, you are safe! Guth. My girl! my girl! My idle girl! my foolish, loving child! My Ina! What! and have I won the fight, And shalt not thou become the richer for't? By Odin, but thou shalt! Come, ask me something! Name me some gift. Come, measure, if thou canst, Thy father's love for thee! What wilt thou ask? Ask me a kingdom! Come? Ina. No kingdom, father, I'd ask of thee—only one little boon. Guth. What is't? Speak out! Ina. Is't granted? Guth. By the God! Out with't—What is't? What little boon is this Which only wants the naming, to be thine, And yet thou seem'st to lack the breath to name? Ina. Is that a rivet of your armour broke? No, no! Guth. And if it were, no blame to it. It turn'd an English javelin. At my feet The weapon fell: I snatch'd it up again, And sent it hissing at its master's head! Enter Soldier. Soldier. This packet found we, Guthrum, in the tent Of Alfred. Guth. Bring'st no tidings of himself? 'Tis certain that he left the field unhurt! Have they return'd whom in pursuit of him— Soldier. They have. Three days they track'd him; on the fourth, All trace of him was lost; but, by report, Alone—without a single follower— The royal fugitive pursues his way, Broken in hopes, as fortunes. Guth. We may chance To overtake yet, or light upon him. Give me the paper. [Takes the packet, and reads. Os. Such things I have heard of—angel forms, Which magic raises—mocking fairest things Of earth; but fairer—to entrance earth's sons— Things they would deem of heaven, though found on earth! Which, once beheld, their helpless functions seize With ravishment, that leaves them but the power To gaze or listen, till no warning effort Of reason, or stronger will avails, to tear The charméd sense away! Edr. Would I were chain'd Again! Her pity makes his freedom poor, That can't awaken it. Guth. [Returning packet.] It matters not, A string of Saxon rhymes! Can Alfred fight? Who flourishes the pen so much, can scarce Be master of the sword! He plays the harp, As they report—the harp! Give me the strain Of the resounding shield! Come, Ina, name The boon thou'dst ask. Ina. When thou art happy, what Most wishest thou? Guth. That happiness may last. Ina. No, no! not that. Thou wishest others happy. Guth. I do! I do! Ina. And so do I. When I Am happy, I'd have all things like me—not That live and move alone, but even such As lack their faculties. Then could I weep, That flowers should smile without perception of The sweetness they discourse. Yea, into rocks Would I infuse soft sense to fill them with The spirit of sweet joy, that everything Should thrill as I do! Then, were I a queen, I'd portion out my realms among my friends, Unstud my crown for strangers, and my coffers Empty in purchasing from foes their frowns, Till I had bought them out; that all should be One reign of smiles around me! I am happy To-day—to-day! that brings thee, father, back, The hundredth time, in triumph and in safety! This day, that smiles so bounteous upon Ina, She'd make to smile e'en upon Ina's foe— Let not the Saxon die! Guth. He lives!—My child! What makes thee gasp? Ina. How near—How near to you Was death that day! 'Twas well for Ina that Your armour proved so true. She had not else A father, now, to ask a boon of, and To get it soon as ask'd! Guth. He lives thy slave! Had he been wise, he now were Guthrum's friend. Ina. His chains— Guth. 'Tis thine to take them off or not. What Guthrum gives, he gives! He is thy slave. Come, Saxon, thou art free! [To Edric.] [Guthrum and Chiefs go out. Edr. Would I were chain'd Again. [Goes out. Os. I gaze, and with my trancéd eyes Drink magic in. I know it, still I gaze. And, yet, can bane reside in aught so sweet? Can poison lodge in that consummate flower, Which blends the virtues of all blooming things, And with the wealth of its fair neighbourhood, Enriches very barrenness, that near it Grows sightly, e'en, and sweet? Ina. How's this, my Edith? My wish, obtain'd, I tremble to enjoy! I need but speak the word, and he is free; Yet, there I let him stand in shackles still, Whose chains to doff, were there no other way, I'd go in bonds myself.—Sweet, be my tongue; Bid them remove his chains. Edith. Unbind him, there! Soldier. My hand is useless, from the fight to-day. Ina. Try you! Edith. [Trying to take off his chains.] It baffles me! It hath a knack I am not mistress of.—Will you not try? [Ina approaches, and takes off his chains. You've done't.—Why, what's the matter with you, Ina? Hast put his fetters on, that here you stand As though bereft of motion? Rouse thee, Ina! Ina. O, for a minute, Edith, in thy bosom, To weep there! Ay, to weep!—to shed such tears As shower down smiling cheeks, when sudden joy Pours in to the o'erfilling of the heart, That look'd not for't; and knows not what to do With all its treasure! Os. I do feel it still! Still do I feel the touch of her fair hand! How passing fair! The driven snow itself Might make as white a one; but then, again, As cold, as that is glowing! Who will loose The fetters it puts on? Or, who that wears them, Would sigh for the embrace of liberty! Truth! honour! all is lapsed. O, for a foe To taunt me now!—O, for a flourish of The Danish trump! Ina. Saxon, wilt follow us? Os. I come, sweet maid! What am I but your slave, To follow, though I leave all else that's bright? [They go out. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II SCENE I. —A wild tract of Country on the border of a Wood. Enter Elswith, in wretched attire, presently followed by Conrad. Con. No farther! Els. Yes! Con. Alas, I can no more! My lapséd strength constrains my limbs to play The traitor to you! Els. What! and thou fall off? Well! I am left at last alone! Old man, Think not that I'd upbraid thee. Thanks to thee For what thou'st done; for what thou canst not do No blame to thee, but pity for thee! More I know my desolation is thy loss Than mine! Back, prithee, to the hut we've left; Thou hast strength enough to crawl there. Con. What I have I'll turn to worthier profit. [Makes a violent effort, and snatches hold of her robe.] Oh! my loved, My honour'd mistress! do not tempt these wilds, Where hunger turns its aching eyes around In vain!—Where prowls, perchance, the savage wolf! Where— Els. Peace!—Talk terror to the dead! Not less Wouldst thou be heeded. I've a heart as dull, Except one fear—one hope—to find my Alfred, Or search for him in vain! There I'm alive! There, only! Counsel should not come from thee, Whose tongue persuaded what thy arm enforced, Desertion of my child! whose fate to avert, A mother's duty 'twas; or, else, to share! And now thou'dst urge desertion of his sire! I wonder not thy limbs are weak—thy heart Not in the cause! and yet it is a king's! But thou'rt his subject only; I'm his wife— So doubly bound to him. Back to the hut! They'll take compassion on thee! Fare thee well! Con. Nay, pause in mercy! See who comes—alas! Should they be Danes!—Yon thicket will conceal us— For thy own safety!—Come!—Alas, the help I fain would give, I stand, myself, in need of! [They retire. Enter Edwy, Arthur, and other Saxons. Edwy. We've rounded now the forest on the east, And, by the sun, our friends should meet us soon, Who gird the other side. A halt, awhile. Arth. But should we miss the King—if still he lives Nor yet is captured, as 'tis rumour'd—He May pass our band unknown; by none of us Beheld, except at distance, when, of late, He marshall'd us, to lead us 'gainst the foe. Elswith rushes forward. Els. Seek ye your king? Edwy. Who art thou? Els. Friend, your leader, Until you find him! Arth. She's distracted! Edwy. Yes. It can't be reason's light which shines so fierce In her unquiet eye, which misses naught, Yet rests on nothing! Els. I command you, Sirs, On your allegiance follow me. Obey Your queen! Arth. Our queen? Edwy. Pshaw, Arthur, such a queen, As frenzy often makes! Come on!—Come on! Our friends will mock us, should they chance to reach The point agreed upon before us. [Edwy and party go out. Els. Stay! Con. [Appearing, and struggling to advance.] Stay, countrymen! It is indeed your queen. Alas! they hear me not! My tongue hath wax'd As feeble as my limbs. [Leans against a tree. Els. Why, let them go! They are not half the band, that I have, here, In loyalty to my liege wedded lord! With that, I'll seek him, under Heaven's high guard! Yea, though I search the quarters of the foe! In that find strength—find courage! That my food, My rest! Farewell, old man! Heaven shelter thee! And be thy mistress' guide. [Goes out. Con. Stay!—Hear me!—Stay! I'll drag my limbs along, to follow thee. [Goes out. SCENE II. —A Hut. Alfred discovered trimming some arrows, with an unfinished bow beside him—Maude kneading flour for cakes. Maude. [Aside.] Ay, there he's at his work! if work be that, Which spareth toil. He'll trim a shaft, or shape A bow with any archer in the land; But neither can he plough, nor sow!—I doubt If he can dig—I am sure he cannot reap— He has hands and arms, but not the use of them! Corin! Alf. Your will? Maude. Would thou couldst do my will As readily as ask it! Go to the door; And look if Edwin comes. Dost see him? Alf. No. Maude. Bad omen that! He'll bring an empty creel; Else, were he home ere now. Put on more wood; And lay the logs on end! You'll learn in time To make a fire! Why, what a litter's there, With trimming of your shafts that never hit! Ten days ago you kill'd a sorry buck; Since when, your quiver you have emptied, thrice, Nor ruffled hair nor feather. Alf. If the game Are scarce and shy, I cannot help it. Maude. Out! Your aim, I wot, is shy, your labour scant! There's game enow, wouldst thou but hunt for them; And when you find them, hit them! What expect'st To-day, for dinner? Alf. What Heaven sends! Maude. Suppose It sends us nought? Alf. Its will be done! Maud. You'd starve? So would not I, knew I to bend a bow, Or cast a line! See if thou hast the skill To watch these cakes, the while they toast. Alf. I'll do My best. Maude. Nor much to brag of, when all's done! [Goes out. Alf. [solus]. This is the lesson of dependence. Will Thankless, that brings not profit; labour, spurn'd, That sweats in vain; and patience, tax'd the more, The more it bears!—And taught unto a king— Taught by a peasant's wife, whom fate hath made Her sovereign's monitress. She little knows At whom she rails; yet is the roof her own; Nor does she play the housewife grudgingly. Give her her humour! So! How stands the account 'Twixt me and fortune?—We are wholly quits!— She dress'd me—She has stripp'd me!—On a throne She placed me—She has struck me from my seat! Nor in the respect where sovereigns share alike With those they rule, was she less kind to me— Less cruel! High she fill'd for me the cup Of bliss connubial—She has emptied it! Parental love she set before me too, And bade me banquet; scarce I tasted, ere She snatch'd the feast away! My queen—My child!— Where are they? 'Neath the ashes of my castle! I sat upon their tomb one day—one night. Then, first, I felt the thraldom of despair! The despot, he! He would not let me weep! There were the fountains of my tears as dry As they had never flow'd! To bursting swell'd My heart; and yet no sigh would he let forth With vent to give it ease! There had I sat And died—But Heaven a stronger tyrant sent— Hunger, that wrench'd me from the other's grasp, And dragg'd me hither! This is not the lesson I set myself to con! Re-enter Maude. Maude. 'Tis noon, and yet No sign of Edwin! Dost thou mind thy task? Look to't! and when the cakes are fit to turn, Call, and I'll come! Alf. I'll turn them, dame. Maude. You will? You'll break them!—Know I not your handy ways? I would not suffer thee put finger to them! Call, when 'tis time. You'll turn the cakes, forsooth! As likely thou couldst make the cakes as turn them! [Goes out. Alf. So much for poverty! Adversity's The nurse for kings;—but then the palace gates Are shut against her!—They would, else, have hearts Of mercy oft'ner—gems, not always, dropp'd In fortune's golden cup. What thought hath he How hunger warpeth honesty, whose meal Still waited on the hour? Can he perceive How nakedness converts the kindly milk Of nature into ice, to whom each change Of season—yea, each shifting of the wind, Presents his fitting suit? Knows he the storm That makes the valiant quail, who hears it only Through the safe wall, its voice alone can pierce; And there talks comfort to him with the tongue, That bids, without, the shelterless despair? Perhaps he marks the mountain wave, and smiles So high it rolls!—while on its fellow hangs The fainting seaman glaring down at death In the deep trough below! Let me extract Riches from penury; from sufferings Blessings; that if I e'er assume again The sceptre, I may be the more a king By being more a man! Maude re-enters, goes towards the fire, lifts the cakes, goes to Alfred, and holds them to him. Maude. Is this your care? Ne'er did you dream that meal was made of corn? Which is not grown until the earth be plough'd; Which is not garner'd up until 'tis cut; Which is not fit for use until 'tis ground; Nor uséd then till kneaded into bread! Ne'er knew you this? It seems you never did, Else had you known the value of the bread; Thought of the ploughman's toil, the reaper's sweat, The miller's labour, and the housewife's thrift; And not have left my barley cakes to burn To very cinders! Alf. I forgot, good dame! Maude. Forgot, good dame!—Forgot! You ne'er forgot To eat my barley cakes! [Knock.] Open the door! Maude sets the cakes on the table, where she had been kneading them; Alfred opens the door. Alf. An aged man! Maude. Come in—Enter an Old Man.] What want you? Old Man. Food! Maude. Want calls on want, when you look here for food! Old Man. Good dame, to say I have not tasted food Since morning yesterday, is not to speak My need more urgent than it is. Maude. Whate'er Thy need, we cannot minister to it— Seek richer quarters. Alf. Stay! He's in the gripe Of straitest want! There's food, and give it him! Maude. What! when we've scanty stock for three days more! Alf. We breakfasted this morning; yesternight We supp'd, and noon ere then had seen us dine. Since yestermorn he has not touch'd a meal! Whoe'er lacks food, 'tis now his turn to eat. This portion would be mine—I'll go without! Here!—Here!—Good dame, the hand which gave us that Will not more sparing of its bounty be For using thus its gift! The hand that fed So many thousands with what only seem'd Provision for a few, can, also, make The remnant answer us for many a meal! Old Man. O strong in faith!—In mercy rich! Whoe'er Thou art, that hand is with thee! Wast thou great, And art thou now brought low?—'twill make thy fall, Thy rise—thy want, abundance—thy endurings, Enjoyings—and thy desolation, troops Of friends and lovers, countless! Does the storm Hold on? Ne'er heed it! There's the sun behind, That, with effulgence, double, shall break through, And make thee cloudless day! [Goes out. Maude. A poor man's wish, They say, is better than a rich man's gift. If house and lands thou'st lost, I would not say But thou mayst get them back again; with roof Enlarged, and acres grown. Yet lands and house To come, are not so good as bread in hand, And that thou'st given away,—if Edwin speeds No better than he did yesterday! Alf. Ne'er fear— These arrows when I've trimm'd, and strung this bow, I'll find thee out a garner in these wilds To dress the table still! Maude. I'd rather trust A peck of barley meal to furnish it! Edwin [without]. What, hoa! within! Maude. 'Tis Edwin's voice! Edwin [without]. Within! Open the door! Maude. Thank Providence, his hands Have something else to do! [Opens the door. Edwin. [Entering with a sack.] Provision, wife! A month's subsistence! Take it in, and ply Thy housewifery; for friends must eat of it— Guests, sure of welcome, who supply the board They ask their hosts to spread—a gallant troop Of countrymen, for common safety link'd, And wand'ring through the land, with hopes, they say, To learn some tidings of their king; and if They find him, list themselves beneath his banner, And face the Dane again. [Maude goes out. Alf. [Aside.] The land's not lost That's left a son to struggle for't! The king That's firmly seated in his people's hearts— His proper throne—although supplanted, reigns. Edwin. [Going to the door.] In! in! Enter Egbert, Kenrick, Arthur, Edwy, Oswald, and others, variously armed. Eg. Thanks, friend! Edwin. No thanks, good sirs, to me, You're guests the frugal'st host might entertain, Who cater for yourselves. Sit down! The board Shall soon be cover'd. Eg. And we bring a cup To cheer it with, with richer beverage Than what the fountain yields, replenish'd. Bring A flagon, worthy host— Ken. [Aside to Arthur.] Commend him to A cover'd board and brimming cup! He's fit To play the leader there;—but he's no head For men like us, that rise betimes from meat, And wish for busy hands! I'm weary on't! Arth. [Aside to Kenrick.] And so am I! and, trust me, of our minds Are many more! Ken. To lead a life of shifts That we may dine in safety! I'll no more on't! Give me a skirmish! Arth. Tell him so! Ken. I will, Ere I touch food, again! [Returns with Arthur. Eg. [To Alfred.] Is it a bow You shape? Alf. It is. Eg. I pray you show it me. [Beckoning Alfred. Alf. [Rising and coming forward.] Here. Eg. [Struck with the appearance of Alfred.] I did wrong to call you from your seat. Alf. No wrong is done where none is meant. Eg. You make The trespass greater, so excusing it! Lodge you beneath this roof? Alf. I do. Eg. [Aside.] I've met With men whose air and faces almost told Their histories, that I could say, “Now this Was such, or such, a man—such course of life, Or such, pursued—this kind of acts, or that, Perform'd.” His dress, alone, bespeaks the peasant. Change it for e'en the richest, he would seem Far more, indeed, at home! Alf. You'd see the bow? Eg. [Mechanically taking, and almost at the same time returning it.] Your pardon! I forgot! I humbly thank you! [Alfred returns to his seat. Enter Maude, with cakes, which she lays on the table, while one of Egbert's party enters with a flagon, and sets it down. Maude. This bread will serve till more is ready, friends. [Goes out. Eg. Sit down. Ken. Sit down who will, I'll not sit down! Arth. Nor I! Osw. Nor I! Eg. Why? what's amiss? Ken. We loathe To lead this wary life. The very deer Confess the covert irksome, and at times Betake them to the plain. Eg. Not when they hear The hunters are abroad! Sit down! Sit down! Ken. We'll not sit down, till 'tis determined who Shall head the table! Eg. I shall head it! Ken. Ay? Edwy. And wherefore should he not? Ken. Go to! Go to! You question far too bold for one so young. Edwy. I question in the right, and so am bold Far less than thou, that question'st in the wrong! Ken. The wrong?—Thou'rt but a boy! Edwy. The boy that proves Himself a man, does all a man can do. Ken. Beware thou dost not prove thyself on me, My metal's temper'd—thine, at best, but raw! Before thy chin exchanged its coat of down For one of manlier fashion, I had shown A beard in twenty fields! Eg. No more of this! The post by lot is mine. I got it not Of mine own choice; nor, yet, by partial leave. It fell to me. It might have fallen to you, To him, or him—to any one—and then— No matter! If, by fearing to be rash, And overshoot the mark, my shaft hath lit O'er-short on't, I am content a better bow Should lead the game. Edwy. It shall not be! We'll have No other leader! Sides, Sirs, sides! Ken. Come on! When they've such stomach for't, 'twere strange if we Lack'd appetite. Come on! Alf. [Rushing in between them as they are on the point of encountering.] Hold!—Stop!—Which side's The Dane? I stand for England! Can it be? You're Saxons all! What! Are your foes so few You make ones of each other? Fie, Sirs! Fie! Arth. [To Kenrick.] Who's he? Ken. I know not. Alf. [To Kenrick.] You're a soldier? Ken. Yes. Alf. Whose sword is that you draw? Ken. My own. Alf. Your country's! You took it, with an oath to use it 'gainst Her foes, and do you turn it on her sons? For shame! Arth. Why bear you his rebuke? Alf. [To Arthur.] And you? Arth. A soldier too! Alf. [To Oswald.] And you? Osw. The same! Alf. Beneath whose banner shot you arrow last? Arth. and Osw. The king's. Alf. And take you aim at the king's liege? As well the king himself! What! do you stand With graspéd weapons still? Or do you look For signal here?—Old soldier, why is this? Is't thus you use your battle-temper'd sword? Is that the rust of Danish blood upon't? These hacks—are they the thrusts of Danish blades? Ne'er hath it met the foe that master'd it? Ne'er hath it fail'd the friend that call'd upon it? Still did it guard thy country while it could? Yet would it back thy king, did he command? And wouldst thou tarnish it? [Kenrick hangs his head. The field, the field, You drew it last in?—Ha!—You start at that! Remember you who won that field? You do! His shout is in thine ear again! Thine eye Beholds him scattering carnage through the ranks Of those that fled!—The Saxon then was down!— What! tighten you your grasp, till, with the strain, Your weapon trembles? Keep it for the Dane, And put it, stainless, up! [Kenrick sheathes his sword—Arthur and Oswald unbend their bows—The rest follow the example. Eg. [Aside.] What man is this, That lacks all sign and title of command, Yet all obey? Edwy. We're friends again? Ken. Content! Eg. A cup, then, to our making up.—Sit down.— A pledge for concord, friends—The king! [Drinks. All. The king! [Drinking successively. Eg. I pray you, Edwy, sing those rhymes for us, You've strung so well, and we so love to hear. Edwy. Right willingly. Though homely be the verse, I dare be sworn was ne'er more rich in heart. [Sings.] When, circling round the festive board, The cup is fill'd the highest; And one and all their love record For him their thought's the nighest; Who owns the name their lips pronounce, While vouching tear-drops spring, Sirs, In eyes he does not see? At once I'll tell you—Here's “The King,” Sirs! When, proud in arms, the nation stood, To front the foul invader; And England did what England could, And fate alone betray'd her; Who was the foremost to advance, The first a spear to fling, Sirs, The last to quit the field? At once I'll tell you—Here's “The King,” Sirs! And, now, when, o'er the prostrate land, The spoiler roams resistless; And Vengeance fears to lift her brand, And Hope almost is listless; Whence does the beam of solace glance, The song of heart'ning ring, Sirs, And promise freedom yet? At once I'll tell you—Here's “The King,” Sirs! Eg. Well sung. Edwy. What's well intended, scarce comes short Howe'er performance halts—I did my best. Alf. My heart o'erflows!—I shall betray myself! What could my palace boast to vie with this? Not for its carved roof would I now exchange These rafters, 'neath whose shelter—vanquish'd, stripp'd Of crown and sceptre—I am still a king— My people's hearts my throne! Eg. What trumpet's that? Arth. [Going to the door.] I'll see. Ken. I know. Eg. Whose is it? Ken. 'Tis the Dane's! I know his flourish well! Let's out, and meet him! Is't not the Dane? [To Arthur, who returns. Arth. It is! They're close upon us!— A quick retreat!—Their numbers double ours! [All start up except Alfred. Alf. No more? Arth. No more!—What can we, one to two? [Alfred rises, looks sternly at him for a moment, and goes out hastily, in an opposite direction. Eg. Why goes he? Arth. For his safety to provide. Let us provide for ours by instant flight. Ken. He's not the man to fly! My life upon it, He'll never turn his back upon the foe!— I told you so! [Alfred returns, armed with sword and target. Alf. What distance off's the Dane? Arth. Scarce half a mile by this! Alf. [To himself.] The wood 's to pass. Unseen we can approach, and set upon them, All unprepared for us. Divide your band! [They mechanically obey him, alternately looking at each other and at Alfred, with an expression of wonder and inquiry. Half with your leader go; and half with me! [Egbert mechanically heads one of the divisions. Ours be it to charge! They're sure to waver. Then Our shout your signal be to second us! My bounding heart presages victory! And so I see does yours, old soldier. [To Kenrick.] Come, There be our first trust; and our second here! Say, would you back your king?—Follow your king! [Alfred and Egbert go out, the rest enthusiastically following. SCENE III. —The Country, interspersed with Wood. Enter Oddune, Edgar, Chiefs, and Soldiers.—Edgar bearing the standard of the Rafen. Od. Halt, comrades! Here we'll take our noon's repast. This velvet sward will be our pleasant couch, To rest us from our toil. And lose not heart! We'll find our Alfred yet! What, though our search Has hitherto proved vain? When look'd for least, Perchance we'll light upon him. Fortune's smiles, Like fortune's frowns, when once they come, come thick! Our expedition fairly has begun, Fairly proceeded, and will fairly end! Edg. Know you these parts? Od. Right well. You stand in Mercia; Where, as that agéd lonely man surmised, A monarch's head beneath a peasant's roof Contented shelters. [Shout.] Hark! the cry of onset! From thence it comes! Guard you the spoil! The rest, That choose it, follow me! [Oddune and Saxons go out—Edgar and Saxons remain. Edg. Hie after them, And bring me word what's passing. If the Dane, [Soldier goes out. My life upon't, again he bites the dust! [Shouts. Another shout! The contest's close at hand! I hear the clashing of their weapons,—Well? [Soldier re-enters. Soldier. The Dane is overthrown! Our countrymen Alone achieved the victory! He fled, Ere full we came in sight. Some man of note Is added to our band, for soon as met Our mighty chief embraced him! Enter Oddune, Alfred, Egbert, and Party, with Oddune's following. Od. Countrymen, Behold your king! Alf. Rise! rise! my gallant friends. We're brothers struggling in one common cause, And by Heaven's high appointment haply met! Od. Haply indeed! Thus at your feet I lay The standard of the Dane! [Takes the Danish standard from Edgar and lays it at Alfred's feet. Alf. What! more success! My faithful Earl! what chance has brought thee hither? Whence comest thou? Od. From my castle, which the Danes Beset, commanded by the brother chiefs Hinguar and Hubba, by whose sister's skill Was wrought that standard, call'd their fatal Rafen; Whose ominous device, they idly feign'd, Upon the eve of victory would flap Its magic-woven wings. It seem'd, indeed, As if death rode upon them, marking us, His prey; for famine plied us worse within, Than e'en the foe without. But 'twas a friend, Severe, to do us good! Despairing succour, And all munition gone, at night we made A sally, all resolved to cut our way Through the enemy, or perish sword in hand! The Dane was unprepared—before our march Startled his ear, our swords were at his breast! My liege, you may believe, the weapons, which Despair first drew, were wielded now by Hope; Escape was certain; but would he escape Whom danger woo'd with chance of victory? We fought for it; and won it! Alf. Fair exploit! Od. Of fairer yet, the news of our success, My liege, gives hope. Such numbers throng'd to us Upon our march, the handful, that I thought To greet you with, has swell'd into a host— Brave volunteers, whose pay's the leave to serve! My liege, your queen and son? Alf. Oddune, forbear! The Dane has buried them—They sleep beneath The ruins of thy master's castle, in The flames of which they perish'd, Oddune! From A dying follower I learn'd it! Learn'd, That treason led the accursed assailants on! If lips that speak for the last time, speak truth, Edric has proved a traitor! Queen and child, Except my country, Oddune, I have none— That, now, is Alfred's all!—His all, for which Alone he cares to live! Now, could we learn The state and numbers of the enemy, A blow might soon be struck—Oddune!— Od. My liege. Alf. [To himself.] No—that were doubtful—Oddune. Od. Well, my liege? Alf. [To himself.] And so were that! Od. My liege, you spoke just now. Alf. Anon, my Oddune! Make the attempt myself? Yes! Life and empire on this east I'll stake! But how provide myself? There is a place In the glen, where, of its shaggy vesture scant, Its sides stand bare, and their huge ribs expose Of solid rock; so giddy steep withal, That down direct from the precipitous verge You many fathoms look.—There have I mark'd A lonely wight at the bottom couch'd, with harp Playing to the idle echoes by the hour, Admiring how they mock'd him—I will use That harp!—will use it to expel the foe, That thrust its master from the shining hall To the dim cavern-cell; spill'd his heap'd dish— O'erturn'd his cup, from all sides running o'er, And cast him, with that golden song of his, To roots and water,—Edwy, speak with me! Wilt be awhile companion to thy king, Though to share danger with him? Edwy. To share death. Alf. Your hand! My friends, our country must be free! My trusty Oddune, wonder not, although You've found your king, to lose him for a time. This list of trusty chiefs, with whom, through means I need not name to thee, I have kept up Intelligence, will show thee whom to warn Of thy success. Summon them to repair To Selwood forest, there to meet their king. There shall we meet again, my gallant friends! Your hands, my chiefs! Soldiers, our hearts embrace! Farewell! Be strong in hope! The land's not lost That's left a son resolved to do her right; And here are troops of sons, and loyal ones! Confirm the stirring spirit of the time Till it o'erspread the realm; the which, throughout, With swiftest expedition bear the call That to her rescue rouses those that love her! Strong in her children should a mother be! Shall ours be helpless that has sons like us? God save our native land, whoever pays The ransom that redeems her!—though the king! There king and subject side by side shall stand! Stand by your king, your king will stand by you! [Alfred and Edwy go out. Oddune and the others severally. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —The inside of Guthrum's Tent. Enter Guthrum and Edric. Guth. I swear a royal booty! Thou hast done Great service to the Dane. With these supplies No need to forage. Here we'll sit at ease, And rest us from the war. Edr. No rest for me! Far richer holds than those which I surprised And plunder'd, at my master's feet shall lay Their treasure and munition. Guth. At thy friend's! Call me not master! Call me father! Think To thy first expedition what we owe!— The capture of the royal Saxon's son, The heir of Alfred! Edr. Would his queen, as well, Were now within thy power!—But she escaped, Or perish'd in the flames. Guth. Come, Edric!—speak; What shall I give thee to reward the love, That so hath labour'd to enrich me? Come, Ask what thou wilt, by Odin it is thine. Edr. Thou badest me call thee father. With the leave Give me the right to hail thee by that title. I ask thy daughter's hand. Guth. I give it thee. Seek her, and bring her hither. Edr. For that boon Command my blood! Ay, every drop of it. [Goes out. Enter Haldane. Hal. My Lord, a Saxon minstrel is without: The string he touches with a master's hand; And as he plays, a youth that waits upon him, Sings to his harp rare tales of love and war As ever gladden'd ear! Guth. Conduct him hither. [Haldane goes out, and returns with Alfred, followed by Edwy. Guthrum, who had sat down, struck by the deportment of Alfred, rises. Guth. Ha! who art thou? What art thou? Alf. I'm the bard. The son of fantasy, Whose world's o' the air—to mortal vision else Impalpable—a paragon to this!— Where he communes with forms, whose radiancy Outshines the lustre of earth's fairest things! Whose title, from above, earth can't confer Or take away! whose smile is coveted By beauty—valour—their bright mirror, where They see themselves more bright! whose tributaries Are kings themselves; whose gorgeous state but serves To swell his strain, that doth emblazon them Beyond their deeds or titles! Guth. Well replied; I like thy answer better, that 'tis bold! Sit down, sit down.—A sample of your skill.— Thou spokest of beauty now,—What canst thou say In praise of it? Alf. [To himself.] Thanks to the tender hand That guided me to con the minstrel's lore, And treasure't in my heart! Guth. Let's taste thy skill. Alfred. Wouldst thou know what beauty is? Beauty is the queen of sighs! Not a heart but owneth this, Proud or humble, light or wise. Crownéd goblets some desire; Some to see the banquet spread; Some prize shining gold; and higher Value some the shining deed; Safety's deem'd a gem by some; Danger, some a jewel call; Some to power desire to come; But beauty is the prized of all! Well the Bard her praise may sing— Of his soul-entrancing lyre, She commands the master-string, That which lends it all its fire! Wanting which he could not sing— Rhymeless, numberless, might be, Nor e'er had won a name for deathless minstrelsy. Guth. Right well thou provest thy title to thy name. What does the youth that waits upon thee? Alf. Sing, The while I play. Guth. We'll hear him at the banquet. Thou art not old—and, yet, thou look'st not young; Thy brow with wisdom graver than with years— I'd talk with you; for great, unless I err, Your skill in lore, we little care to search Whose school's the battle-field. Attend me! Come. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —A sequestered rural spot near the Camp. Enter Ina (leading Ethelred), Edith, and Boy. Edith. Your little charge is a fair healthful plant, Whose thriving looks bespeak your careful tending. How strong is infancy in its helplessness! Of all that dwelt within the hold where he Was found, no soul, they say, was spared but him, Howe'er they pray'd for mercy! Ina. Little praise To him that saved him! Edric's treacherous heart Can own no touch of mercy! Know you not The boy is Alfred's son? His hold it was, Which Edric with my father's host beset, When found the chief this boy. Go on before, We'll follow you; and mind you spare no pains To humour him. [To Boy, who goes out with Ethelred. I should not love thee, boy: Thy race is Ina's bane! Edith. Why say'st thou so? The Saxon loves thee, Ina. Ina. Loves me? Edith. Yes! What, though his passion is not on his tongue; His heart is full of it. It speaks in sighs— Love's proper words. Ne'er plainer spoke to ear! Ina. Nay, tell me not. His heart is stone to me! He sighs! but 'tis for freedom! Edith. 'Tis for you! How love is blind to what it pines to see! You think him stone; belike so thinks he you. Couldst see thyself, thou wouldst at once see him! Your eyes, at parting, that strain after him, At meeting, feast on any other thing; Your tongue, that, when he hears not, rings with him, In his hearing's noteless, as it ne'er knew sound. For too strong love, his love's accounted none. Ina. I tell thee, no! His thoughts abide not here. They're with his countrymen, some daughter fair Of whom he loves—not Ina.—Be it so! The cheek I love shall smile, though not on me! The bird, I'd keep with me I will let go, And free from bondage that would kill with doating. He's free—My father gives him liberty. Edith. And what for thee? Ina. To die, like a poor flower That lives with only gazing on the sun; But from her radiant lord too long shut out By the cold cloud, in silence hangs her head, And dies a smiling death! Edith. He comes. Ina. Alas, For the last time! Oswith enters, perceiving Ina. Os. Still, still, my treacherous steps Betray me, leading me to what I'd shun; Yet what is ever present to my thought Why fears my eye to see? My thraldom's full— If 'tis enchantment, better to enjoy The fatal sweetness of the powerful spell I strive in vain to break! Ina. Saxon, thou'rt free. Os. Recall thy words! Ina. I speak my father's will. Os. Why does he give me liberty? Ina. Because His Ina begg'd the boon. Os. Why did she so? Would she had begg'd my death! I did not ask For freedom;—thraldom was more kind to me, Which chain'd me unto that I ought to fly, But fain would cling to! Honour did not swerve That was constrain'd to look upon its bane; And if it look'd till it forgot itself, 'Twas its mischance—not crime.—Now, if it falls, It falls of its own will! O maid, too fair! Help me to 'scape the ruin thou hast wrought! Think—think—'tis an apostate kneels to thee! Instruct thy melting eye to flash with scorn— Teach thy sweet tongue harsh indignation's note— Erect thy form with dread severity— Till, like a seraph, sterner in thy frown For what thou look'st and breath'st of beauteous heaven, Thou awest me into virtue! Ina. Wouldst thou be free, Thou art so! Os. Am I? Lady, there are bonds, The wearing which endears them to the slave, So that he hugs them—would not be set free! Free me from these! Ina. What bonds? Os. E'en such, as not Our limbs imprison, but the things that rule them— Our thoughts and wills—as coil about our hearts, And keep their hold, when links of steel were wax. Ina. Methinks I have a guess what bonds you mean! Are they not heavy ones when worn, alone, But light when others share them? Is it so? Hadst thou such partnership, wouldst thou be free? I would not, so had I! Os. It cannot be! Half she reveals her heart, and veils her eyes. Do her veil'd eyes unveil the other half? Am I so bless'd, so cursed, as to be loved? Nay, then, 'tis fate I'd cope with, and must yield! Oh, to have fallen in battle!—to have fallen When honour was my mistress!—to have fallen When in her radiant eye I drew my sword, And deem'd my life a stake not worth a thought To venture for her smile!—when wooing her, I strode more blithely through the battle-field, Than e'er I bounded down the festive hall! Ina. What makes thee wish for death? Os. The dread to lose What was my more than life; but now seems poor— Like to be cast away, since I have found A good I covet more than life and it! Ina. What dost thou covet so? Os. Thee, lady, thee! Thou art that good of value paramount! Oh, to have met thee with a heart at large! No solemn debt—no knotted tie upon it! Free to be all thy own—to render thee Its whole of love, hope, honour, loyalty— One large, unbroken, everlasting gift— The hand which now, in doubtful joy, I take— How had I caught in trancéd ecstasy, And kneeling, laid the offering at thy feet! Enter Edric. Edr. Let go that hand! 'Tis mine! Os. What fire is this, That like the lightning darts through me, and feels As all-consuming!—Thine! Ina. Believe him not. Oswith, believe him not—believe the maid That all forgets herself with thought of thee, Casts off the bashful 'tire of virginhood, And, unenforced, confesses she's thine own!— The eyes turns on thee she would still avert, And lets thee see them, though they stream with love!— Calls on thee with the tongue that ne'er till now Betray'd her secret, to receive't for thine! Believe him not, he sports with thee!—Thy heart Is not more surely seated in thy breast, Than is thy image lodged in Ina's heart— Not more the spring of life to thee, than that Is life itself to Ina! 'Fore the world Will I proclaim me thine, and cleave to thee! But plight me faith for faith. Os. I do, sweet maid! Edr. [Drawing his sword.] My right's a bar, which thou must first remove! Os. Thy right! What right? [Half drawing his sword. Ina. Give me the hand that grasps the sword, and grasp My hand, instead! Thou'rt mine! Thy hand—thy arm— Thy all are mine! My all I have given for thee! Paid down for thee a virgin's heart, that ne'er Before in love was barter'd. Give me thy hand! Or thou'rt the falsest, most forsworn of men, Breaking the vow that scarce hath left thy lips; And I'm the poorest, most abused of maids! Give me thy hand! Nay, an thou wilt not, thus Upon thy arm I'll hang, and be thy shield, Taking the blows upon my fearless breast, That threaten wound to thine. Os. [Taking his hand from his sword.] Thy right? What right? Edr. Dost wish to learn? Such as the bridegroom claims— As makes the lover bless his stars, and gives Fulfilment of his long-enduring hopes— As turns his blissful dreams to substances, So rich, past credence, still he thinks he dreams— Asks if he wakes—believes it—doubts it—sickens Lest day prove night, and truthful morning come, And in his very arms his treasures fade! Os. [Half drawing his sword again.] A bridegroom's right! Ina. That right is thine alone! O how thy frame with fearful passion shakes! While thy full orbs strain on thy countryman, With deadly purpose fraught! Turn them on me! Read who is Ina's bridegroom in her face! See whom her eyes with fondness strain upon, As thine on him with hate! O what a fee Thou mak'st me pay for that which costs thee nought! I call thee lord—If that contents thee not, Why then the dearer name of husband take, And give me in exchange, an only look! Os. [To Edric.] Explain thy words. Edr. The service I have done The Dane, he bids me name requital for; And by his God he binds himself, whate'er The boon, to grant it. Ina was the boon. [Oswith draws his sword. Ina. List to me, Oswith—Oswith—by thy love!— My father's oath has made me his! Hear mine! By Odin, I'll be bride to none but thee! Edr. Force will exact what frowardness denies! Os. And thou couldst wed the bride that loathéd thee? Edr. Yes. Os. Put up thy sword. I'd whisper thee. [They whisper. Ina. Say it out. Thy breath is mine! More than her own it feeds Thy Ina's life! O, 'tis a treacherous breath, To play the traitor to its mistress thus! Speak out, I say! Thou heed'st me not! False friend! Friend cruel and unfair, that gives me nought, Whilst I give all to him! Edr. 'Tis well. [Goes out. Ina. 'Tis ill! Not half so plain thy gleaming brandish'd sword Could threaten death, as doth thy flashing eye! Os. Ina, thy fears are causeless. Prithee hence, Back to the camp; whilst I revolve the means Shall bring the course of our now thwarted loves To prosperous issue. Ina. I'll revolve them with thee; And thou shalt find how thrifty woman's wit, When set to work by love! Os. My Ina!—Love! Bride!—Wife!—for wedded they whom love has join'd— I'd be alone. Ina. I will not leave thee! Come! We'll go to the camp together. Os. Sweet! my way Lies this way. Ina. So does mine, then. Os. Nay, farewell! Ina. You leave me not! I'll cling to thee till death Disjoins us! Drag me if thou wilt, I'll ne'er Let go my hold! Oh was there ever maid So lost for love! that knelt—that bent the knee— Pleaded her cause with her bold tongue—paid tribute, Large as her eyes could furnish, of her tears To an unheeding lover, deaf to her, And scarce confess'd an hour! Re-enter Edric. Edr. Was it for this Thou sent'st me hence? to give thee pause for dalliance! Traitor! Os. Ha! Edr. Coward! [Both draw. Enter Guthrum and Alfred. Guth. Hold! forbear! Who stirs, There's not another step 'twixt him and death! How is this?—I deem'd you friends!—Your cause of quarrel? Ina, my child! what share hast thou in't? What! Dost turn from me? [Angrily. Ina. My father! Guth. There! there! there! [Pressing her to him. Did I speak roughly to thee? Silly fawn, Startled at but a sound! Art thou in tears? It does concern thee, then?—How?—Ina, speak! Dost hear me? Answer, girl! Well; never heed. You would if you could! No matter! Noble Edric, Declare the cause of quarrel to thy friend. Ina. Thou'rt not his friend! Call not thyself his friend! Guth. My Ina, but I must! and so must thou— Ina. Never! Guth. What's that!—My child, beware! You know I brook not thwarting!—must not be gainsaid! Call him thy friend! Come! Show me thou'rt my child! My flesh! my blood! that owe themselves to me, And should be subject to me! Wilt not speak? Take counsel! Something 's rising in my heart That bodes not good to thee! Once more I say, Resist me not! Submit! Call him thy friend. Art silent still? Now, minstrel, prove thou'rt wise! I found thee so when we discoursed of peace! Of war!—the duties subjects owe to kings, And kings to subjects. Now propound the means Behoves a father take, who would untie A wilful daughter's tongue! Alf. Force but subdues The weak; but, with the strong, 'tis met by force. Was never found the noble nature yet That crouch'd before a frown! 'Tis sway'd with smiles. Chiding her nature thou but chid'st thy own! She's thy soul's bright and fair reflecting glass! But look at her! Sits not thy upper lip— All manly as it is, and bold, to hers— More proudly firm upon thy nether one, Than hers upon its fellow! Vauntest thou, As only late thou didst, rebuke with thee, Given as rebuke, ne'er mended failing yet? Then is thy boast her pardon! Give me favour For speaking thus my thought. Guth. Thou dost my wish. I like thy frankness! Yes; I see! You're right! She's all her father's child! Come to me, Ina! [She rushes into his arms. What wouldst thou do for me? Ina. Aught that I could. Guth. Ah, there my Ina speaks! I like thee thus! Thus Ina, when thou hang'st upon my neck, And gazest in my face! My Ina, list! I'll tell thee wherefore I would have thee call The Saxon friend. I've sworn to give thee to him. Ina. Without my heart? What, father, give my hand Without my heart? Not so wouldst thou give thine, And make a league of friendship with thy hand Thy heart protested 'gainst! And what were that, Compared to one of love?—a league of friendship, That barr'd a friend out, and enclosed a foe! Wouldst thou do that? Thou wouldst not give a smile Without thy soul's consent. And wouldst thou have Thy Ina give her hand without her heart? Guth. Dread Odin has my oath! Ina. So has he mine! Guth. What hast thou sworn? Ina. Eternal truth to love! Guth. Thou dost not know the passion? But thou dost! 'Tis clear! I see too sure thou art its thrall! Upon thy cheek his crimson pennon waves! Thy downcast eyes pay homage to his sway! Thy heaving breast by its commotion shows The conqueror is within! I see his power Confess'd in every fibre of thy frame! Whom dost thou love? Who has lit up this flame? Ina. [Kneeling.] Thou, father, thou; whose fondness for thy child Would sketch for her the man thou'dst have her wed; How he should be among his peers in rank— And that the first—without a peer in worth! Most brave!—most true!—most generous!—most good! Fit to be challenger of all the noble field, In all achievements of supreme renown; And bear the palm from all! Nor yet to lack Those qualities of visage, and of form, Which to these other richer graces join'd, Make the consummate man! But that I saw My father such a man, I should have deem'd A phantom 'twas he drew for me; for ne'er, Except in him, saw I embodied wealth Of so rare worth—until I saw it there! [Pointing to Oswith. Guth. What's this to me? Ina. The being of thy child— Thy Ina!—thy dear Ina!—who forgets Her father 'tis she's kneeling to, as though He were a stranger to her; but, now, leaps Into his bosom! Oh, I'd like to see The harm could reach me here! Guth. The Saxon dies! Ina. No! no! Guth. He spurn'd the proffer of his life, When forfeit to the God! Ina. Nay hear me! Guth. Spurn'd My friendship! Guthrum's friendship! Ina. No! Guth. He did! I loved him, though my foe, because I mark'd His prowess in the fight! I could have thought The God himself had turn'd against his sons, And, angry, sided with their enemies! He was my captive! He had bled to Odin! I proffer'd him my friendship, would he make Alliance with the Dane, to snatch him from The altar; and he spurn'd me! Ay! refused The hand of a victorious king, through faith To an uncrownéd fugitive! He did! I spared him at my child's beseeching! He That spurn'd the parent, now would win the child! He dies! Alf. [Aside to Guthrum.] Thy Ina dies! See, how she hangs, Half dead, already on thy shoulder! Much Thou lov'st her! If none other calls thee father, Beware thou art not childless! Guth. Am I in the wrong? Demand I more than is a father's due? What is her life, but portion of my breath? Alf. A portion thou'dst give all thy breath to save! Guth. Thou sayest right. Alf. A portion, too, which she Would render up, not only to save thine, But let thee breathe with ease! Guth. Thou sayest right; Yet bows she not her fancy to my will Alf. She cannot. Guth. How? Alf. You ask; and you have loved! Guth. How know you that? Alf. Who has not felt the flame? Your passion was repaid. Guth. How know you that? Alf. How know I that? From nought but mutual love A flower, consummate rich like that, could grow, Where fairest things that harmonize unite! E'en such a skin should such a mould incase, To such a heart, be casket such a mould; Such lineaments compose the beauteous face, Of such a neck that makes its graceful seat! And skin, and mould, and heart, and face be served By such a minstrel as that tuneful tongue! This speaks the mingling of accordant hearts, Throbbing in fervent unity; that one No thought, no wish, no hope, no joy can lodge, But finds its fellow at the other's core! Guth. Minstrel, thou'rt right! Deep does thy wisdom search! Her mother, Eva, was my only love, As I was hers! Though daughter of my foe, She left her father, friends, land, faith, and all, To follow me. She did!—She did! Alf. And that's Her child, in whom, the passion that bless'd thee, Thou'dst turn into a curse! Guth. I like not that! Thou makest too bold to say I'd curse my child! Alf. Look at her! Guth. Thou art right! Say on! Say on! Yet where's the profit? Win me Odin's ear, And move the God to give me back my oath! Thou but perplexest me! Since thou'rt so wise, Show me the way not to forswear myself; And yet not keep my oath! Alf. Two oaths the God Has register'd; one only can be kept. Which he accepts, the God himself decide. You say he rules the sword; then to the sword Entrust the cause, and these the terms of strife— Who masters first his adversary's sword And yet not sheds his blood, be his the maid! Os. Content! Edr. Content! Ina. Oswith, this chain's of gold, [Still leaning on her father. That never knew alloy—cunningly wrought— An amulet, that ever faithful guards The wearer's wishes. Hang it round thy neck, Thy Ina's fate goes with it! Proves it false, Drop it into the grave where I shall lie, Ere, by its treachery, thy rival thrives! Guth. And Edric, thou receive this ring from me. The hand that wears it, holds its weapon true, If faithful to the Dane, as thou to me! Alf. I have a ring, a charméd bauble too. Power to the hand it graces, does it give, O'er falsehood to prevail. 'Tis his who'll take it— But who would wear it, and its virtue prove, Must first affirm he owns a loyal heart— True to the king that first his homage claim'd, The land that gave him birth—Wilt take it, thou? [To Edric. Edr. The ring I'll trust is this I now put on, The guard of my good sword! Alf. Wilt take it thou? [To Oswith. Os. Though to the king I'm true That first my homage claim'd—true to the land That gave me birth! yet more, than true to these, The thrall of love, I dare not take the ring! Alf. Show me thy hand—my countryman!—'Tis on! 'Tis a true hand—for ne'er would fit the ring Disloyal finger yet. Look at it well! Lo! speak I not the truth? Os. [Recognising Alfred.] My liege! Alf. Beware! In whose but a true subject's hands would place A king his life. Be of good heart! No doubt Palsy thy arm! The wishes of thy love, Thy king, are with thee! Heaven be with thee too! Guth. Away! I'll follow you! and see myself This bloodless trial made [Oswith and Edric go out. Here minstrel, take My child! Support her! Cheer her to abide The issue of their strife. [Goes out Alf. [Supporting Ina.] Fair maiden, take The minstrel's word, thy lover wins the game! Thy fears are wrongs, where wrong thou least wouldst do! Doubt on thy champion did another cast, How would disdain arouse thy languid lip; Colour thy frozen cheek from snow to flame; And the expired lustre of thine eye Re-kindle till it lighten'd! Maiden, list! The hand's best sinew ever is the heart! Thy lover's is the sound one! Think of that! That's right! Look up! Take courage! Oswith throws His brand away, and grapples Edric's! Ha! Keep thy hold, Edric, if thou canst! A child's— An infant's—is it to thy rival's grasp! Look on thy lover, maiden! His chief's eye Upon him, double is a vassal's strength; What then the lover's, in his mistress' eye, That strives for victory, and she the prize? He sees thee! Mark you, how his frame distends, As though with superhuman vigour fraught, At his good angel's sight? Wave, maiden fair, Wave your white arm to him! 'Twere ten times worth A royal pennon in a monarch's hand, Cheering the champion of his challenged crown! You see! You see! Now puts he forth his might! Edric gives way! He faints! His limbs are wax, Wrestling with limbs of steel! He falls! His sword Waves o'er his head, in noble Oswith's hand. Hold up! Nay, gasp not! It were wrong to die, Slain by thy gallant lover's victory! Enter Guthrum, leading Oswith. Guth. There, Saxon, take my child; but thou'rt my thrall. Thou must not bear her hence! Alf. He should not!—Guthrum, Where'er I speak of thee I'll give thee out Indeed a royal chief! Farewell! Guth. Not yet. By Odin, thou shalt join our feast! I say Thou shalt not go! I like thy company! I'd hear thy harp again! Come! Follow all. [They go out. Re-enter Edric. Edr. Foil'd, but not yet o'ercome. The baffled foe That will not turn a friend, is like to prove A deadly one! Oswith has won the maid, But not possess'd her yet! I'll mar his love! That minstrel is not what he'd seem! Me He shuns!—communes with Oswith!—Oswith knows him! Some man of note—a prize to Guthrum—which If Oswith lets escape, he wrongs the Dane! Hence, will I work his ruin! To the banquet! I'll watch their every movement; and unmask him, Though I should tear the visor from his face! [Goes out. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —The inside of Guthrum's Tent. Guthrum, Oswith, Ina, Chiefs, Alfred, Edwy, &amp;c. &amp;c. Enter Edric. Guth. Come Edric, though not Fortune's friend, thou'rt mine. Why didst thou stay behind? Sit by me, Edric. Look to the minstrel!—See that his goblet's full!— Let it o'erflow—See to't! Os. You feast not, love. Ina. No more do you. Os. I do not care to feast. When the heart banquets, viands are pass'd by! Edith. [Entering.] Your little Saxon favourite wants you, Ina. He clamours for you, nought can quiet him. Ina. Nay, try and soothe him. If he baffles thee, Why bring him hither, then! [Edith goes out. Guth. Come, strike your harp! We'd hear a strain; and prithee let it be A warlike one. The triumph of the Dane— Cast thou play that? Alf. Accurséd be the bard That sings his country's shame! Her glory, chief, I'll sing! My harp hath often rung with it! Shall ring again! Or if the theme be done, The strings, which many a year my hands have kiss'd, I'll tear from their loved frame, though as they snap My heart-strings break, and I partake the ruin! Guth. By Odin, but thou'rt bold! I like thee for't. Play what thou wilt. Well! what's to be the strain? Alf. The downfall of Cadwallon. Guth. What was he? Alf. The Saxons' foe. Alfred plays while Edwy sings. Cry, cry to the eagle, her feast is prepared; Cadwallon the Lion his falchion has bared! Ten thousand spears dance to his trumpet's song, As his march in thunder rolls along! Does she hear? Will she come? Is she hurrying down? All's ready, and waiting for her alone! But the might's with the right, From the cloud breaks the light; And the head, high at morning—may lie low ere the night! But why does the Saxon, Oswald, kneel? Is't for his prayers he is dresséd in steel? And wherefore kneel his Saxon bands? Do they pray with their weapons in their hands? Or are they contented to banquet the guest Cadwallon the Lion has call'd to his feast? But the might's with the right, From the cloud breaks the light; And the head, high at morning—may lie low ere the night! Not long did the Saxon kneel—He arose With a shout that made leap the bold hearts of his foes; And on he rush'd, and down he bore The spears that hunted him, before; And the trumpet that sounded the first for the field— Cadwallon the Lion's—was the first that was still'd! For the might's with the right, From the cloud breaks the light; And the head, high at morning—may lie low ere the night! But where is the eagle, was call'd to the feast? She is come! but Cadwallon salutes not his guest! She has fall'n to her meal without beckon or word! She screams with her glee, but her mirth is unheard; She has perch'd on the head of the warrior's son, And the blood-drop that falls from her beak, is his own. For the might's with the right, From the cloud breaks the light; And the head, high at morning—may lie low ere the night! Guth. Well done! A strain that for a warrior's ear! For me, thrice precious is the ruby cup Since the enchanting strain has breathed upon it! Drink, friends! Come!—Lips to brims; There's magic in The cup! The health of him that pours it in— “The bard,” the king of song, whose praise to sound Becomes and not disparages the lips Of kings themselves! Alf. [Aside.] A regal nature his! There's something in thee, Guthrum, I could claim Close kindred with; but there's no grasping hands For thee and me, save in the deadly strife That ends the hope of one of us! I've gain'd All needful knowledge. Ward of caution none They keep—in our complete discomfiture Secure. An easy prey they're sure to fall To sudden onset from a band like ours, Strong in their cause, and resolute of heart. Enter Elswith, pale, emaciated, and in wretched attire. Guth. Ha! who art thou? Els. Who play'd that strain! Guth. Thou ask'st As if reply were not a boon, but debt! Whence gottest thou that air of high command? Els. From misery! Guth. She strangely teaches thee; Making thee stately that makes others bow! What seek'st thou here? Els. I heard a strain without; I'd learn who play'd that strain. Guth. That harper. Els. He! Hope, thou didst right to mock me! I have found thee Still, a dissembler; yet would trust thee still! But now farewell, thou thing of specious tongue, But hollow heart!—smooth face, that's but a mask To cover what we loathe—great promiser, Little performer!—coiner of false smiles, That turn out tears at last. I've done with thee! [She sits in the centre. Otho. Thou sitt'st in Guthrum's presence. Els. What of that? I have sat down with Despair—a greater chief Than Guthrum—one could make him gnash his teeth! Ay, could he, mighty as your master is! I've sat down with Despair! Now show me Death! I'll take my seat by him! I fear him not! Alf. Contain thyself, my heart!—It is my queen! Guth. Her mind's distracted! Alf. No!—It is her heart. Ina. Perhaps she hungers. Give her food! [They present food to her. Els. Too rich! Famine partakes not such! She feeds on haws, Acorns, and roots, and berries! Give me these! For these we thank the Dane! Guth. You thank the Dane! Ha! Alf. 'Tis a woman in affliction speaks! Guth. And let her speak! Yet does she mar the cheer. Remove her! Els. Touch me not! Stand off! My name Is Woe! I am the child of Wrath! Behold How she has smitten me, and smitten me, That mine own eyes don't know me! One hot day, Parch'd up with thirst and hunger, of a brook I stoop'd to drink, and saw myself, and scream'd At presence of a stranger! Time makes things Unlike the things they were; but Wrath's the changer! Guth. Persuade her to go hence. Els. I hear you! Ill You entertain the guests you force to greet you! Guth. We force! Els. Ay!—burn them out of house and home! Murder their husbands, and their children!—scatter Their friends, that where a thousand troop to-day Not one is found to-morrow!—bid them search For viands in the larders of the wolf And vulture! which, deriding them, perforce They come to you! Guth. Hence with her! force her hence! Alf. [Starting up.] Who hand of force lays on her, let him die! And save thy manly name from the reproach, That in thy presence, misery like this Was offer'd insult with impunity, And in the sacred person of a woman! Els. The voice too!—No! it is not, cannot be! Guth. Heard'st what she said? Alf. I did. Guth. Was't true? Alf. Free speech Accord'st thou me? Guth. 'Tis thine! Alf. The truth she speaks. But one she seems 'mongst thousands, whom thy sword, Ravenous of conquest, hath made widows of, And childless mothers! Who, this hour thou feast'st, Are famishing!—in their own land, without Abode or food—and curse the hour when first Thou trodd'st upon their shores! Guth. In their own land? [He quits his seat and approaches Alfred. Surely I heard thee not! In their own land? 'Tis mine!—all mine!—their land!—air! water!—they Themselves!—All mine! Mine! Mine! They! Thou! Ay, thou! That mock'st me!—bravest me!—thou, I say, art mine! My thrall!—my slave!—a worm!—thing for my foot To tread upon! Confess it! Alf. No! Guth. Thou wilt not! Know'st thou the man thou tempt'st? Dost hear me? Think'st thou I speak to thee by my page, to whom thou'rt free To lend but half an ear?—mayst pass excused To bear no duty in thine air, thine eye? Mayst answer by a nod, or not at all? I'm Guthrum! He whose breath's thy life! A look— An only look of whose incenséd wrath Might strike thee dead! Dost thou not tremble? Alf. No! Guth. Up, slave, and beg thy life! Alf. Why beg for that I deem not worth the only asking for; Moreover, that thou hast not power to take? Guth. Not power to take? Was never Guthrum braved By mortal man before!—Not power to take!— Guthrum is but a child!—Strong as my wrath, My stronger wonder overpowers it quite, And from a tempest quells me to a calm! The reason? Come, I'll let thee have thy way, Givest thou me but the reason. Come!—the reason? Be it but half-sufficient, it shall weigh Acquittance of thee! Come! the reason—come! Alf. Your royal word is warrant for my safety. What by your leave I speak, yourself forbids you To turn to evil 'gainst me. Guth. Right, by Odin! You're always right! and you may speak again, And freely as before! [Resumes his seat. Ina. I prithee, Oswith, Persuade thy countryman to leave the tent. What now is safety may anon prove danger. Fierce as 'tis sudden is my father's wrath; And ever in the hour of social cheer Most to be fear'd, and look'd for—Speak to him! Conjure him to go hence. [Oswith approaches Alfred. Os. Had he a steed— Ina. A steed?—An easy thing, my Oswith! Two— The fleetest in the camp—shall be at hand, Ready caparison'd—behind the tent— That way conduct him hence. [Whispers an Attendant, who goes out, while Oswith approaches Alfred. Os. My liege, your ear. Edr. [To Guthrum.] You mark, my lord, he whispers him. Guth. I do. Edr. They understand each other. Guth. What of that? Edr. I'll keep my eye upon them. Guth. Heed them not. Enter Edith with Ethelred. Els. Whose child is that? not thine! Edith. He is not mine. Els. He's not a Danish child! Edith. He's not. Els. Is he A Saxon then? Edith. He is a Saxon child. Els. A Saxon! Pray you let me see his face! He's mine! Edith. He shrinks from thee. He knows thee not. Els. Me can he know, that do not know myself? He'll know my voice! My child! My Ethelred! He knows it not! and is my voice changed too? Or does my face false witness bear so strong, He gives not credence to his mother's voice! He is my child! Believe it for my tears, My choking utterance, my bended knees, And my imploring arms that sue to you, And ask you for my child! Alf. [Aside.] Does Providence Vouchsafe such mercy! Guth. If the child is thine, Thou'lt know where it was found. Els. Too well I know! Both when and where. A castle did ye sack, Whose tenant was the mother of that child. At night the cry arose, “The Dane!” “The Dane!” And then the bursting gate!—the clash of arms! The shout!—the yell!—the shriek!—the groan!—which rage And cruelty, and fear, and pain supply, To make the concert, fell, of savage war! That mother's care too safe had lodged her child In the remotest chamber of the whole. She ask'd for it; “The Dane!” was the reply. She would have sought it; but they held her back, And cried, “The Dane!” She shriek'd to be set free; Now threaten'd!—now implored!—but all in vain! “The Dane!” was all the answer she could get! They forced her thence in cruel duty! Ay!— In duty forced the mother from her child; While lent the Dane a torch to light her path— Her flaming towers that blazed about her boy!— And she went mad!—yet still they bore her on; Nor other heed to her distraction gave, Except to cry, “The Dane!” “The Dane!” “The Dane!” [Sinks exhausted upon a seat, clasping her forehead. Guthrum and Edric whisper. Els. Alas! they give not credence to my words! Will no one plead for me? My countryman, Essay your art! Hast not some melting strain— Such as draw tears whether they will or not? As moves. [Recognising Alfred.] I've found him! Edr. [Coming forward.] Whom? Whom hast thou found? Els. [Recollecting herself.] My boy! Edr. [Aside.] I thought she meant the minstrel. Alf. Yes! She knows me, and I am a husband still! I am a father and a husband still! Oh, happiness, thou comest out of time! Thou choosest ill the place to greet me in! Thou mockest me to hold thine arms to me! I dare not rush to their embrace! I'm poor, With all the wealth thou say'st is mine again! I dare not touch it! Better were it far, I had not now been told on't. Guth. Take the boy! But first true answer to our question give. The castle where we found him was the king's! Clad as no vassal's offspring was the child. If thou his mother art, thou art the queen! Art thou so? Alf. Guthrum, to the test I put Thy nature! If 'tis worthy of thy state, Thy prosperous fortune, and thy high renown, Approve it now! Lo, Guthrum, do I play The traitor for thy honour! In thy power Thou hold'st the son and consort of thy foe! Of Alfred! Use thy fortune as beseems thee! Swear by thy God, they shall receive from thee Safeguard of life and honour. Guth. Ay, by Odin. Els. Wouldst thou not take a ransom for us? Guth. Yes! Els. What ransom wilt thou take? Guth. Thy husband's crown! Els. Alas! he will not ransom us with that! Alf. He should not! Guth. Why? Alf. He wears it for his people. The day he put it on he vow'd himself Of them the father! To their parent land It wedded him! His proper consort she! 'Twixt him and them, he knows not wife, or child, He dares allow to stand! Guth. Minstrel, thou ravest! He has not nature, who 'gainst nature's law Could so deny his heart! Alf. He may have more! Guth. What? Alf. The command of nature. The attribute Of kings who feel the import of their titles. Which stops their ears against her piercing cries! Which shuts their eyes against her thrilling looks! Which lifts them so 'bove earth, they seem as though They sat in some attendant brighter sphere, Wherefrom they look'd and ruled her! Guth. Well thou said'st Thy world was of the air! Thou dost not speak Of things of earth! Thy sayings are not sooth! I would thy king were here to prove thee but A dreamer! With those jewels in his eye, He would not see his crown! Yea, though it shone Bright as it did before I thinn'd its studs! Couldst find thy king? Alf. I could. Guth. Go seek him, then. And when thou find'st him, greet him from me thus— “Thy queen and son are now in Guthrum's power, Pay thou but homage to the Dane, they're free.” Alf. I take my leave. Els. Guthrum. A boon! Guth. What is't? Els. I'd send a message to my lord! Guth. Thou shalt. Stand all apart, that freely they confer. Els. And dost thou go; and wilt thou leave us here? Alf. I must. Alas! thou know'st not what thou say'st! Els. Thou'lt leave us here! Dost thou not love our child? Alf. Beyond my life! Els. And me? Alf. Beyond our child! Els. And must thou leave me? Oh! I have search'd for thee Many, and many a day! Now fear'd thee, dead! Now hoped thee, living! Search'd for thee alone! One falling now; and now another off; With my strong love unequal to keep pace. Sleeping in woods and caves! On foot, by dawn; Ne'er giving o'er till night again! Now food, Now nothing! Scantily I fared to-day; Yet 'twas not hunger brought me here, but thou, In desperate hope to find thee! Art thou found, But to be lost again? Alf. So were I found, Went I not instant hence. Look in my eyes, And read the husband and the father there, In nature's undissembling language vouch'd! But, hear the king! Els. Well! Alf. Paramount of all, My public function! Husband—father—friend— All titles, and all ties are merged in that! Approve thyself the consort of a king! I leave thee to return to thee! Return, With freedom for thy child—for thee—myself— For all—for all must perish, or be free! And soon I come! So cheer thy heart with hope! Farewell! Els. [aloud]. You'll bear my duty to my lord? Alf. I will. Els. Your hand that you will keep your word! Alf. There, lady. Els. Be thy hand my missive! Thus— Thus with my tears I write my errand on't— And with my lips—a faithful signet—seal it! O, countryman! perhaps nor he nor thou Shalt ever see me more! I feel as one Amerced of life—that shakes a hand with all— And asks a blessing from the meanest tongue! Thy blessing, minstrel, ere thy mistress dies! Alf. What love would ask to light on head beloved— What faith and virtue Heaven's own warrant have To ask of Heaven—light on thy honour'd head! Edr. I'll see him eye to eye, ere he departs. Alf. Farewell! Edr. Stay, minstrel. Let me see thy face! [Edric stops Alfred forcibly. Os. All's lost! [Half drawing his sword.] Alf. [Turning fully and sternly upon Edr.] There, traitor! [Edric, utterly confounded, staggers back. Os. Fly, my liege!—Away! [Alfred, Edwy, and Oswith go out. Guth. What moves thee, Edric? What's the matter? Speak! Why is thine eyeball fix'd, thy mouth agape? What ails thy blood, that it forsakes thy cheek? Why shakes thy frame? Edr. My liege! Guth. Out with it! Edr. The minstrel! Guth. What of the minstrel? Edr. Oswith plays thee false! No minstrel leaves the camp; but Oswith thence, Treacherous to thee, conducts thine enemy, Alfred, the Saxon king! Guth. Ha, follow them! Stop his retreat! Away! Alive or dead, Have them before us! [Edric, Otho, and others go out. Els. Mercy! Guthrum! Mercy! [Clashing of swords. Guth. Remove her! Els. Where's the lightning!—What! no bolt To blast the impious hand that threatens death To his anointed head. O mercy! mercy! [She is forced off, Edith following with the child. Edr. [without]. Traitor, give way. Os. [without]. Make way—for none I'll give. [The fighting continues. Guth. Who aids him? Is there treason in the camp, That thus the contest lasts? Give me my sword. Ina. [Kneeling to Guthrum.] My father! Guth. [Not heeding her.] Ho! my buckler and my spear! With mine own hand will I transfix him! Ina. Father! Enter Edric, wounded. Edr. At last, my lord, we've overpower'd him. Guth. Whom? Edr. Oswith. Guth. And Alfred? Edr. Alfred has escaped! Guth. Lay Oswith in chains. Ina. My father! Guth. To the God I give him!—Odin, take him!—He is thine! By thy victorious spear he bleeds to thee. [Edric goes out. Give him my child!—the traitor! Give him my blood! I'd pour it out upon the altar first! I would, with mine own hand! I'd look on her! And do it! Look on her! Up, girl, and hence! Ha! Do I see a statue or my child? That cheek is marble by its hue!—Those eyes— The chisel makes as good, for any touch Of sense that's in them! What is it I've done? Oh! they have loved and pined, and loved again As fresh as ever! Take her to her couch! She'll sleep—will she sleep? There, gently! I am grown From fire to ice with looking on her. Ha! For what have I done this?—Why stand you here? What! have I paid so dearly for the prize, And do you let it go? Pursue! Pursue! [They go out. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. —Ina's Tent. A Recess in the centre, with a curtain drawn before it. Enter Guthrum, Edith, and Oscar. Guth. What say the priests? Osc. You may not spare his life! Your oath to Odin must be kept, unless His country he forswears, and serves the God— Conditions which he spurns. Would, else, the tide Of your great nation's prosperous fortune ebb To an eternal drought! Among the ranks They run, thy oath reiterating, and, with words Ambiguous, starting fears, you may retract, And curse your people! Guth. Let their altar reek! Blood rain upon them till it drown them! Leave The tent! Osc. Shall they prepare to sacrifice? Guth. Tell them, if for command of mine they wait, I will not give it!—No! not for their god! She speaks not? [Oscar goes out. Edith. Nay, my lord, at times a word; But none that leads to certain inference. Guth. Has she not slept? Edith. Nought but unnatural sleep— Rest that might pass for wakefulness—that scarce Doth shut the lid—which weariness itself Beholding, ere 'twould taste, would watch; it seems So far from sweet! All listlessness without, While all within's astir! Guth. I will not see her. Edith. My lord? Guth. I did not speak; or if I did, 'Twas not to thee! I thought myself a father! I thought as never father loved his child I loved my Ina! 'Twas my pride to show it; Yea, even when she ruled me like a child! I used to think that of my fiercest mood She was the mistress, from my wildest flight Could call me down, but lit my eye upon her, As the loved lure the falcon!—and I've kill'd her! I'm not a father!—No, I never loved her But as a child, a toy! Come, show her to me! Undraw the curtain! He that makes a corse Of what he loves, may sure be flint enough To look upon't. [Edith undraws the curtain, and Ina is discovered sitting in a state of fixed abstraction. Edith raises her, and leads her forward to a couch, Ina moving as if it were mechanically. Leave us to ourselves. [Edith goes out. Why, 'tis enough to make the sickly heart Break out in laughter, when the very work Our eyes could weep them tearless at, our hands May boast the making of! [Approaches, and sits down beside her. My Ina! Ina!— My child! you'll speak to me?—What, are you ill? How feel you?—You look well!—There, my own girl, Lie in your father's bosom!—Speak to him! What say'st thou, Sweet?—Wast not about to speak? Thou wast. Go on, go on!—Speak to me—Ina; Or I'll go mad!—Dost hear?—On my knees, I pray you speak to me!—Now, this is wilful! Away!—You but dissemble!—'Tis put on!— For shame, for shame! You've seen my eyes in tears! You've seen my knees upon the ground!—You know It is your father—your old father, and You'll not speak to him!—Think you he can't see? Why, any one could do't! To fix the eye And keep the visage motionless, and sit As you were riveted to your seat! A child Were scant of wit that lack'd such obvious power— Of simulation! I renounce you, Ina!— [Going. Will you not speak to me, my child? Speak to me! [Returns. A word—a whisper—anything!—a sign— To show me that you are not worse than dead— Alive, and just the same! I can be rash! I can give way to fury!—I will try If life be in thy heart! [Draws his dagger, and rushes up to her. I'd scare a stone! [Wild discordant music is heard without. Ina starts up and clasps her hands. Guth. Ha! Ina. There it is! Guth. She speaks!—She is alive! Ina. I've listen'd for't So long, I fear'd 'twould never come! Guth. What, Ina? [Music again. Ina. Again! Guth. Do they prepare to lead him forth; The sacrifice will presently begin! They make a pretext of their god to mock My power! Ina. He's ready!—Let me go to him! Guth. To whom? Thy lover? Ina. I should like to get My father's blessing first! Guth. Thou hast it, Ina! Ina. I know I have. Who says he does not love me? I'd not believe it, though he were to kill me! He'd do't in madness, and he'd kill himself When he had found he had done it! Bless his Ina? He always blesses me!—at morning when He sees me first, and then, again, at night! Yea, ofttimes through the day! He'd bless me, though I broke his heart; and I'll bless him, although He has broken mine! Guth. She knows me not! Ina. We'll wed As never lovers did. We'll have our nuptials Of a new fashion. Who'd be bid to them, Let him bring tears with him, he's welcome—such As gush with sobs! We'll have no smiles at them! The meanest churl gets handfuls when he weds! Nor songs! such minstrelsy a beggar buys For thanks! No, give us shrieks! and laughter! but Such laughter as it withers joy to hear!— As breaketh from the heart of madness!—as Resounds from lips that wish their owners dead! Guth. What mean those words, my child? Ina. I'll wed him as Ne'er wedded maid, to let him never from My side; but dwell in such entrancement with him, The day for us may go without his sun, And night without her cloud! all converse cease, Of tongue or eye; that not ourselves shall break The silence sweet of our deep ecstasy. Guth. Perception's all within; without is none. Passion hath drunk up sense! I feel a touch Of her condition while I look upon her— Go mad! You had a daughter yesterday— Brag of her now! Point to her cheek, and ask If ever grew such smiles as blossom there! And bid the ear that listens to her, note The sweetness that it feasts on! [Music.] Hark! thou'rt call'd! What! not go through the task thou hast begun So bravely? Slay thy child, and finish it! [Rushes out. Ina [alone]. They'd thwart a maid in her first love, they would? They think it easy, but they'll find it hard! When first I thought I should become a bride, Wondering how I would deck me, I ran through The ranks of fairest flowers to pick me one To set it in my bosom; and I remember It was a rose I pitch'd on—There's my rose! [Draws a dagger, and returns it to her bosom. [Music.] The rites begin,—Let me steal after them, And watch the time! I'm coming to thee, Oswith! I'll show thee how a Danish maid can love! [Goes out. SCENE II. —Selwood Forest. Enter Oddune and Oswald, meeting. Od. No sign of Alfred? Osw. None! Our scouts have all Return'd, dishearten'd with their fruitless search. Od. Where can he linger, with so fair a welcome Impatient waiting him, as he would meet From yonder gallant bands? The spirits now That bear their crests so high, from his delay To lead them on to action, will anon Begin to droop—perchance may quite subside! Osw. How many do we muster? Od. By the last Return, six thousand men. Osw. The field shows fair! Od. Fair cause—fair field! Who'd e'er expect so soon To see the armour burnish'd up again They cast aside for good! A pity 'twere What shows such thrift should not be turn'd to use, But, bootless, thrown away! They will not fight Unless the king commands them! Osw. See, my lord, What movement's that? Od. Here's one will tell us. Edg. [Entering.] Be Prepared, my lord. The soldiers clamour for The king, and doubts are spreading through the ranks; You humour them—he will not come to lead them. Their chiefs conduct them hither, from your own lips Assurance to receive, and fair encouragement. Enter Egbert, Kenrick, Arthur, Chief, and Soldiers. Eg. Now Kenrick, speak! Say what the soldiers want. Od. Well, gallant friends! Is England to be free? Shall we change places with our conquerors, Or still endure the yoke? Ken. We want the king! Let him appear, we cannot meet the foe Too soon! Od. As surely shall you see him, as You long to see the foe! Ken. But when, my lord? 'Tis that we'd know! When was the king the last Upon the field? Has he not ever, on The eve of battle, earlier than his chiefs, Been out; with looks of ardour heartening us?— Our morning sun, that never clouded rose— Enduing us with life and vigour new! At most we muster bare six thousand men To meet the Danish host! The king, among us, Would make our numbers treble! Show us the king. The only waving of his plume in battle Were worth a hundred spears in hands as bold As ever brandish'd weapon! Od. What, and if Indeed he should not come? Ought you to feel Your tyrant's feet upon your necks the less? Your king is present in his cause! Be that Your king! [Alfred enters, still disguised. Whoever leads you, meet the Dane! I speak not, friends, because I'm next in place! I care not for myself! Point out my post; The van, the rear; I'll be content to take My stand beside the man of meanest note Among you! Make yon minstrel without helm Or sword your leader, I will follow him! So that I fight, I care not in what rank! Let him who makes the absence of his king, Plea to desert his country and his king, Fall off! So Heaven sustain me in the cause, Although our Alfred's presence now would add Ten other richer lives to mine; yet say He should not come, this faithful sword I draw, I will not sheathe till it has struck a blow For liberty! Eg. I second you, brave Oddune. Osw. And so do I! Od. And so will every man, Unless there be among the people one That does not love his king! Ken. No, Oddune, no! The people live but for their king! Alf. [Discovering himself.] The king Lives only for his people! Oh, my people! You are the drops of blood that make your king! And do I see you once again in arms! [Bursts into tears. The chiefs and general soldiers seem affected.] O friends! Why draw you hands across your eyes, If mine should be ashamed of what they do? We've met again, my friends! Who is the foe Shall sunder us again? O England! England! Too fair—too richly gifted—not to tempt The spoiler—well that thou hast sons, too true, To leave thee to his ravine! Thou'lt be free Till thou art childless! Think not, gallant friends, An hour I've squander'd that was due to you, And to our common country! I have seen The Danish camp! Od. Their camp, my liege! Alf. Have stood In Guthrum's very presence! That disguise Will tell thee how. They'd fall an easy prey To half our numbers! Friends! a royal stake I've laid upon your heads, that you will win The day! Od. What stake, my liege? Alf. Your prince and queen! They're in the spoiler's power. I might, indeed, Have ransom'd them, but what he ask'd, your king could not afford to pay. Od. What was't, my liege? Alf. My people, Oddune! Eg. In the spoiler's power Our prince and queen! What wait we for? Od. For nothing, But the king's word to move upon the foe! Alf. Upon him, then! Now think you on the things You most do love! Husbands and fathers on Their wives and children—lovers upon their mistresses— And all upon their country! When you use Your weapons, think on the beseeching eyes To whet them could have lent you tears for water. Oh, now be men or never! From your hearths Thrust the unbidden feet, that from their nooks Your aged fathers drove—your wives and babes! The couches your fair-handed daughters used To spread, let not the vaunting stranger press, Weary from spoiling you! Your roofs that hear The wanton riot of the intruding guest That mocks their masters—clear them for the sake Of the manhood, to which all that's precious clings, Else perishes. The land that bore you—oh! Do honour to her! Let her glory in Your breeding!—Rescue her—Revenge her, or Ne'er call her mother more! Come on, my friends! And where you take your stand upon the field, Thence, howsoever you advance, resolve A foot you'll ne'er recede; while from the tongues Of womanhood and childhood, helplessness Invokes you to be strong! Come on! Come on! I'll bring you to the foe! And when you meet him, Strike hard! Strike home! Strike while a blow Is in an arm! Strike till you're free, or fall! [They go out. SCENE III. —A Wood. The statue of Odin in the centre; before it an altar prepared for sacrifice. Enter procession of sacrifice, in the following order: —Danish Chief, with a body of Danish Soldiers; a body of Danish Chiefs, and Amund, Edric, and Guthrum; a body of Danish Priests; Assistants with torches; Boys carrying censers; one Boy with a cushion, on which the knife of sacrifice is laid; Chief Priest of Odin; Oswith; a body of Danish Soldiers. The procession marches to the following chorus:— [Chorus.] Prepare the faggot—light the brand— The victim's ready for the God! The knife is bare in the sacred hand, That on the altar pours the blood! Prepare!—Prepare!—Prepare!— Great Odin's rites The mortal who slights, His roof shall blaze in peace—his spear shall break in war! Guth. Saxon! Thou hast of life a moment yet At thy command—Use it for life!—for love!— For liberty! But say the word, at once The weapon, ready for thy blood, is sheath'd, Unstain'd and harmless! Os. I'm prepared to die! Priest. Saxon! Os. I come! Priest. Come! Bare his breast! Odin, receive thy victim! Ina. [Rushing in.] Oswith, I wed thee thus! [She is on the point of plunging the dagger into her heart; Oswith bursts from the Priest and arrests her arm. Os. Hold, Ina, hold! Thou shalt not die with Oswith! Guth. Oswith, live! Although the God himself demanded him, He shall not die who saves my Ina's life! Priest. The servants of the God protect his rights! Danish Soldiers. [Rushing in.] The Saxon's in the camp, and down upon us! Alf. [without]. Press on—press on—the first that comes to blows Is the king's 'squire! Press on! [The Danes front the stage on which the Saxons are coming, who enter, headed by Alfred. Danes are driven off; Alfred and Guthrum engage; Guthrum is disarmed. Alf. Guthrum, live The friend of Alfred! Serve the God he serves! To wear a crown, thou need'st not fight for one, Except to keep it! Fair Northumbria Receives thee for her king—My queen and son! [Oddune leads on Elswith and Ethelred. Enter Egbert and Edric, guarded. Alf. Who's he? Eg. A traitor to our cause, my lord— Whose sword has made more havoc 'mongst our people, Than any ten of your foes! His hand, accurst, It was that fired the hold where slept your queen And son. Ken. and others. Despatch him! Alf. Hold! This victory I will perpetuate by such an act As shall from future kings remove the power To make their public functions pander to Their private gust! Select twelve men, his peers, And swearing them upon the book of God, As they shall answer at the judgment-day, To try their prisoner fairly, let the charge Be brought before them; and as they decide, Be finally his innocence or guilt Establish'd. Hence! Hereby shall private right, Which, guarded, fortifieth, more than arms, The conservator of the public weal, Be sacred even from the sceptre's touch! Thus to a people faithful to their king, A faithful king an institution gives That makes the lowly cottage lofty as The regal dome—holds justice paramount Of all—before her throne the peasant and The king himself on equal footing brings!— A gift which you'll preserve for ever whole! From which, as from your blood, pollution keep! Which, if you're ask'd to render back, by all You owe yourselves, your country, and the throne, You'll answer no! Which, when you'd name, you'll call Trial by Jury! Guth. Great the victory That kings gain o'er themselves. Blest are the heads That bow to sway like thine! Alf. My countrymen! Sons of the sea—henceforth her restless plain Shall be your battle-field! There shall you meet The threat'ning storm of war! There shall it burst, Its rage unfelt at home—its din unheard! You've fought like England's true-born sons, to-day! You've taught a lesson to her sons to come! By your example fired, should e'er a foe In after-times invade her envied shores, Her sons, of all descriptions and degrees, To succour her, shall grapple soul and hand; Rampart her throne with living walls of hearts, And teach the fell invader that the sea Embraced her, never to betray her glory! END OF ALFRED THE GREAT.</field>
