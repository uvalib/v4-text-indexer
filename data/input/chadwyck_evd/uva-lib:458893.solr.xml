      <field name="fulltext">VPON THIS WORKE OF HIS beloued friend the Avthor. I am snap't already, and may goe my way; The Poet-Critick's come; I heare him say, This Yovth's mistooke, The Authors Worke's a Play. He could not misse it; he will strait appeare At such a baite; Twas laid on purpose there To take the vermine, and I haue him here. Sirra, you wilbe nibling; a small bitt, (a sillable) when yo' are i' the hungry fitt, Will serue to stay the stomacke of your witt. Foole; Knaue; what's worse? for worse cannot depraue thee. And were the diuell now instantly to haue thee, Thou canst not instance such a worke to saue thee. 'Mongst all the ballets which thou dost compose, And what thou stil'st thy Poems, ill as those, And void of rime, and reason, thy worse Prose. Yet like a rude Iack-sauce in Poesie, With thoughts vnblest, and hand vnmanerly, Rauishing branches from Apoll'os tree. Thou mak'st a garland (for thy touch vnfit) And boldly deck'st thy pig-brain'd sconce with it, As if it were the Supreme Head of wit. The blameles Muses blush; who not allow That reuerend Order, to each vulgar brow, Whose sinfull touch prophanes the holy Bough. Hence (shallow Prophet) and admire the straine Of thine owne Pen, or thy poore Copesinat's vaine. This Piece too carious is, for thy course braine. Here witt (more fortunate) is ioyn'd with Art, And that most sacred Frenzie beares a part Infus'd by Nature in the Poe'ts heart. Here, may the Puny-wits themselues direct, Here, may the Wisest find what to affect; And Kings may learne their proper Dialect. On then, deare friend, Thy Pen thy Name shall spread; And should'st thou write, while thou shalt not be read, Thy Muse must labour, when thy Hand is dead. W. B.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. Prim. ScÃ¦. Pri. Graccho, Iouio, Giouanni, with Flagons. Gra. Take euery man his flagon: giue the oath To al you meet: I am this day, the state drunkard; (I am sure against my will) And if you finde A man at ten, that's sober, hee's a Traitor, And in my name arrest him. Io. Very good Sir: But say hee be a Sexton? Gra. If the bells, Ring out of tune, as if the street were burning, And he cry 'tis rare Musicke: bid him sleepe, 'Tis a signe he has tooke his liquour; And if you meet An officer preaching of sobriety, Vnlesse he read it in Geneua print, Lay him by the heeles. Io. But thinke you tis a fault To be found sober? Gra. It is Capitall Treason, Or if you Mittigate it, Let such pay Fortie Crownes to the poore; But giue a pention To all the magistrates, you find singing catches, Or their Wiues dauncing; For the Courtiers reeling, And the Duke himselfe, (I dare not say distemperd, But kind, and in his tottering chaire carousing) They doe the countrie seruice. If you meet, One that eates bread, a child of Ignorance, And bred vp in the darkenesse of no drinking, In the true posture, though he die in the taking His drench, it skilles not: What's a priuate man For the publike honour? we haue nought else to thinke on. And so deere friends, copartners in my trauailes Drinke hard; and let the health run through the City, Vntill it reele againe: and with me crie: Long liue the Dutches. Enter Tiberio Stephano. Io. Heere are two Lords; what thinke you? Shall we giue the oath to them? Gra. Fie, no: I know them, You neede not sweare 'em; your Lord, by his pattent Stands bound to take his rouse. Long liue the Dutches. Exit Gra. Io. Step. The cause of this. But yesterday the court, Wore the sad liuerie of distrust, and feare; No smile, not in a buffon to bee seene, Or common iester; The great Duke himselfe, Had sorrow in his face: which waited on By his mother, sister, and his fairest Dutches, Dispers'd a silent mourning through all Millaine: As if some great blow had been giuen the State, Or were at least expected. Tib. Stephano, I know, as you are noble, you are honest, And capable of secrets, of more weight, Then now I shall deliuer. If that Sforza, The present Duke, (though his whole life hath beene, But one continued pilgrimage, through dangers, Affrights, and horrors: which, his Fortune, guided By his strong Iudgement, still hath ouercome) Appeares now shaken, it deserues no wonder. All that his youth hath laboured for: the haruest Sowen by his industry, readie to be reap'd, to, Being now at the stake; And all his hopes confirmd, Or lost for euer. Step. I know no such hazard: His guards are stronge, and sure, His coffers full, The people well affected; And so wisely His prouident care hath wrought: that though warre rages In most parts of our westerne world, there is No enemie neere vs. Tib. Dangers that we see To threaten ruine, are with ease preuented: But those strike deadly, that come vnexpected; The lightning is farre off: yet soone as seene, We may behold the terrible effects, That it produceth. But Ile helpe your knowledge, And make his cause of feare familiar to you. The warre so long continued betweene The Emperour Charles, and Francis the French King Haue interrest'd in eithers cause, the most Of the Italian Princes: Among which Sforza, As one of greatest power, was sought by both, But with assurance hauing one his frend, The other liu'd his enemie. Step. Tis true, And 'twas a doubtfull choice. Tib. But hee, well knowing, And hauing too, (it seemes) the Spanish pride, Lent his assistance to the King of France: Which hath so farre incens'd the Emperor, That all his hopes, and honours are embark'd, With his great Patrons Fortune. Step. Which stands faire, For ought I yet can heare. Tib. But should it change, The Duke's vndon. They haue drawne to the field Two royall armies, full of fierie youth, Of equall spirit to dare, and power to doe: So neere entrench'd, that 'tis beyond all hope, Of humaine councell, they can er'e be seuerd, Vntill it be determin'd by the sword, Who hath the better cause. For the successe, Concludes the victor innocent, and the vanquish'd Most miserably guilty. How vncertaine, The Fortune of the warre is, children know; And, it being in suspence, on whose faire Tent, Win'gd victory wil make her glorious stand; You cannot blame the Duke, though he appeare, Perplex'd, and troubled. Step. But why then, In such a time when euery knee should bend, For the successe, and safetie of his person, Are these lowd triumphs? In my weake opinion, They are vnseasonable. Tib. I iudge so too; But onely in the cause to be excus'd. It is the Dutchesse Birth-day: once a yeere Solemniz'd, with all pompe, and ceremony: In which, the Duke is not his owne, but hers: Nay, euery day indeed, he is her creature, For neuer man so doted; But to tell The tenth part of his fondnesse, to a stranger, Would argue me of fiction. Step. She's indeed, A Lady of most exquisite forme. Tib. She knowes it, And how to prize it. Step. I ne're heard her tainted, In any point of honour. Tib. On my life, Shee's constant to his bed, and well deserues His largest Fauours. But when beauty is Stampt on great women, great in birth, and fortune, And blowne by flatterers greater then it is, 'Tis seldome vnaccompanied with pride; Nor is shee, that-way free. Presuming on The Dukes affection, and her owne Desert, Shee beares her selfe with such a Maiestie, Looking with scorne on all, as things beneath her: That Sforzas mother, (that would loose no part Of what, was once her owne): Nor his faire Sister, (A Lady too acquainted with her worth, Will brooke it well; And howsoer'e, their hate, Is smother'd for a time, Tis more then feard, It will at length breake out. Step. Hee, in whose power 'tis, Turne all to the best. Tib. Come, let vs to the Court, We there shall see, all brauery, and cost, That art can boast of. Exeunt. Step. Ile beare you company. Enter Francisco, Isabella, Mariana. Ma. I will not goe, I scorne to be a spot In her proud traine. Isa. Shall I, that am his mother, Be so indulgent, as to waite on her, That owes me duty? Fra. Tis done to the Duke, And not to her. And my sweet wife remember, And Madam, if you please receiue my councell, As Sforza is your sonne, you may command him, And as a sister you may challenge from him, A brothers loue, and Fauour: But this graunted, Consider hee's the Prince, and you, his Subiects, And not to question, or contend with her, Whom hee is pleasd to honour; Priuate men Preferre their wiues: and shall hee being a Prince, And blest with one that is the Paradice Of sweetnesse, and of beauty, to whose charge, The stocke of womens goodnesse is giuen vp, Not vse her, like her selfe? Isa. You are euer forward, To sing her praises Ma. Others are as faire, I am sure as noble. Fra. I detract from none, In giuing her, wha'ts due. Were she defor'md, Yet being the Dutches, I stand bound to serue her, But as she is, to admire her. Neuer wife, Met with a purer heate her husbands feruer; A happie paire, one in the other blest: She confident in her selfe, hee's wholy hers, And cannot seeke for change: and he secure That tis not in the power of man to tempt her. And therefore, to contest with her that is The stronger, and the better part of him, Is more then folly; You know him of a nature, Not to be play'd with: and should you forget To 'obey him as your Prince, hee'le not remember, The dutie that he owes you. Isa. Tis but trueth: Come cleere our browes, and let vs to the banquet, But not to serue his Idoll. Ma. I shall doe, What may become the sister of a Prince, But will not stoope, beneath it. Fra. Yet be wise, Sore not too high to fall, but stoope to rise. Exeunt. Enter three Gentlemen setting forth a banquet. 1. Ge. Quicke quicke for loues sake, let the court put on Her choicest outside: Cost, and brauerie Be onely thought of. 2. Gent. All that may be had To please the eye, the eare, taste, touch, or smell, Are carefully prouided. 3. Gen. Ther's a Masque, Haue you heard what's the inuention? 1. Gent. No matter, It is intended for the Dutches honour. And if it giue her glorious attributes, As the most faire, most vertuous, and the rest, 'Twill please the Duke. They come. 3. Gent. All is in order. Enter Tiberio, Stephano, Francisco, Sforza, Marcellia, Isabella, Mariana, attendants Sfo. You are the Mistris of the feast, sit heere; O my soules comfort: And when Sforza bowes Thus low to doe you honour, let none thinke The meanest seruice they can pay my loue, But as a faire addition to those tytles, They stand possest of. Let me glory in My happinesse, and mightie Kings looke pale With enuie, while I triumph in mine owne. O mother looke on her, sister admire her: And since this present age yeelds not a woman Worthy to be her second, borrow of Times past: and let imagination helpe Of those canoniz'd Ladies Sparta boasts of, And, in her greatnesse, Rome was proud to owe To fashion: and yet still you must confesse, The PhÅnix of perfection ner'e was seene, But in my faire Marcelia. Fra. She's indeede The wonder of all times. Tib. Your excellence, (Though I confesse you giue her but her owne) Enforces her modestie to the defence Of a sweet blush. Sfo. It neede not my Marcelia; When most I striue to praise thee, I appeare A poore detracter: For thou art indeed So absolute in bodie, and in minde, That, but to speake the least part to the height, Would aske an Angels tongue: and yet then end In silent admiration! Isab. You still court her, As if she were a Mistris, not your wife. Sfo. A Mistris mother? she is more to me, And euery day, deserues more to be su'de too. Such as are cloyd with those they haue embrac'd, May thinke their wooing done: No night to mee, But is a brydall one, where Himen lights His torches fresh, and new: And those delights, Which are not to be cloth'd in ayrie sounds, Inioyd, beget desires, as full of heat, And Iouiall feruor, as when first I tasted Her virgin fruit; Blest night, and be it numbred Amongst those happy ones, in which a blessing Was by the full consent of all the Starrs, Confer'd vpon mankind. Marc. My worthiest Lord, The onely obiect I behold with pleasure: My pride, my glory, in a word my all; Beare witnesse Heauen, that I esteeme my selfe In nothing worthy of the meanest praise, You can bestow, vnlesse it be in this, That in my heart I loue, and honor you. And but that it would smell of arrogance, To speake my strong desire, and zeale to serue you: I then could say, these eyes yet neuer saw The rising Sun, but that my vowes, and prayers, Were sent to Heauen, for the prosperitie And safety of my Lord; Nor haue I euer Had other studie, but how to appeare Worthy your fauour: and that my embraces, Might yeeld a fruitfull Haruest of content, For all your noble trauaile, in the purchase, Of her, that's still your seruant; By these lips, (Which pardon mee, that I presume to kisse) Sfo. O sweare, for euer sweare. Marce. I ne're will seeke Delight, but in your pleasure: and desire, When you are seated with all Earthly glories, And age, and honours make you fit for Heauen, That one Graue may receiue vs, Sf. 'Tis belieu'd, Belieu'd, my blest One. Mari. How she winds her selfe Into his Soule! Sf. Sit all: Let others feed On those grosse Cates, while Sforza banquets with Immortall Viands, tane in at his Eyes. I could liue euer thus. Command the Eunuch To sing the Dittie that I last compos'd, In prayse of my Marcelia. From whence? Ent. Post Post. From Pauie, my dread Lord. Sf. Speake, is all lost? Post. The Letter will informe you. Fran. How his Hand shakes, As he receiues it? Mari. This is some allay To his hot passion. Sf. Though it bring death, ile read it. May it please your Excellence to vnderstand, that the verie houre I wrot this, I heard a bold defiance deliuered by a Herald from the Emperor, which was chearefully receiu'd by the King of France. The battailes being readie to ioyne, and the Vantguard committed to my charge, inforces me to end abruptly. Your Highnesse humble Seruant, Gaspero. Readie to ioyne, By this, then I am nothing, Or my Estate secure. Marc. My Lord. Sf. To doubt, Is worse then to haue lost: And to despaire, Is but to antidate those miseries, That must fall on vs. All my hopes depending Vpon this battailes fortune; In my Soule Me thinkes there should be that Imperious power, By supernaturall, not vsuall meanes, T'informe me what I am. The cause consider'd, Why should I feare? The French are bold and strong, Their numbers full, and in their counsels wise: But then, the haughtie Spaniard is all Fire, Hot in his executions; Fortunate In his attempts; Married to victorie: I, there it is that shakes me. Franc. Excellent Lady: This day was dedicated to your Honor: One gale of your sweet breath will easily Disperse these Clouds: And, but your selfe, ther's none That dare speake to him. Marc. I will run the hazard. My Lord? Sf. Ha: Pardon me Marcelia, I am troubled; And stand vncertaine, whether I am Master Of ought that's worth the owning. Marc. I am yours Sir; And I haue heard you sweare, I being safe, There was no losse could moue you. This day Sir, Is by your guift made mine: Can you reuoke A Grant made to Marcelia? Your Marcelia? For whose loue, nay, whose honour (gentle Sir) All deepe designes, and State affaires defer'd: Be, as you purpos'd, merrie. Sf. Out of my sight, And all thoughts that may strangle mirth forsake me. Fall what can fall, I dare the worst of Fate; Though the Foundation of the Earth should shrinke, The glorious Eye of Heauen loose his Splendor: Supported thus, I'le stand vpon the ruins, And seeke for new life here. Why are you sad? No other sports? By Heauen he's not my friend, That weares one Furrow in his Face. I was told There was a Masque. Franc. They waite your Highnesse pleasure, And when you please to haue it. Sf. Bid 'em enter: Come, make me happie once againe. I am rap't, 'Tis not to day, to morrow, or the next, But all my dayes, and yeeres shall be employed To doe thee honour. Marc. And my life to serue you. A Horne. Franc. Another Post? Goe hang him, hang him I say, I will not interrupt my present pleasures, Although his message should import my Head: Hang him I say. Marc. Nay, good Sir, I am pleas'd, To grant a little intermission to you: Who knowes, but he brings newes, we wish to heare, To heighten our delights. Sf. As wise as faire. Ent. another Post. From Gaspero? Post. That was, my Lord. Sf. How, dead? Post. With the deliuerie of this, and prayers, To guard your Excellencie from certaine dangers, He ceast to be a Man. Sf. All that my feares Could fashion to me, or my enemies wish Is falne vpon me. Silence, that harsh musicke, 'Tis now vnseasonable; A tolling Bell, As a sad Harbinger to tell me, that, This pamper'd lumpe of Flesh, must feast the Wormes. 'Tis fitter for me, I am sick. Marc. My Lord. Sf. Sick to the death, Marcelia, Remoue These signes of mirth, they were ominous, and but vsherd Sorrow and ruine. Marc. Blesse vs Heauen! Isab. My Sonne. Marc. What suddaine change is this? Sf. All leaue the roome; Ile beare alone the burthen of my griefe, And must admit no partner. I am yet Your Prince, wher's your obedience? Stay Marcelia: I cannot be so greedie of a sorrow, In which you must not share. Marc. And chearefully, I will sustaine my part. Why looke you pale? Where is that wonted constancie, and courage, That dar'd the worst of Fortune? Where is Sforza? To whom all dangers that fright common men, Appear'd but Panicque terrors? Why doe you eye me With such fix'd lookes? Loue, counsell, dutie, seruice, May flow from me, not danger. Sf. O Marcelia! It is for thee I feare: For thee, thy Sforza Shakes like a coward; For my selfe, vnmou'd: I could haue heard my troupes were cut in peeces, My Generall slaine; And he; on whom my hopes Of Rule, of State, of Life, had their dependance; The King of France, my greatest friend, made prisoner To so proud enemies. Marc. Then you haue iust cause To show you are a Man. Sf. All this were nothing, Though I ad to it, that I am assur'd For giuing ayd to this vnfortunate King, The Emperour incenc'd, layes his command On his victorious Army, flesh'd with spoyle, And bold of conquest, to march vp against me, And sease on my Estates: Suppose that done too, The Citie tane, the Kennels running blood, The ransack'd Temples, falling on their Saints: My Mother in my sight, toss'd on their Pikes, And Sister rauish'd: And my selfe bound fast In Chaines, to grace their Triumph: Or what else, An Enemies insolence could load me with, I would be Sforza still; But when I thinke, That my Marcelia (to whom, all these Are but as Atomes to the greatest Hill) Must suffer in my cause: And for me suffer All Earthly torments; Nay, euen those the damn'd Houl for in Hell, are gentle strokes, compar'd To what I feele Marcelia. Marc. Good Sir, haue patience: I can as well partake your aduerse fortune, As I thus long haue had an ample share, In your prosperitie. Tis not in the power Of Fate to alter me: For while I am, In spight of't, I am yours. Sf. But should that will To be so forc'd Marcelia? And I liue To see those Eyes I prize aboue mine owne, Dart fauours (though compel'd) vpon another? Or those sweet Lips (yeelding Immortall Nectar) Be gently touch'd by any but my selfe? Thinke, thinke Marcelia, what a cursed thing I were, beyond expression. Marc. Doe not feed Those iealous thoughts; The only blessing that Heauen hath bestow'd on vs, more then on beasts, Is, that 'tis in our pleasure when to dye. Besides, were I now in anothers power, There are so many wayes to let out life, I would not liue, for one short minute his; I was borne only yours, and I will dye so. Sf. Angels reward the goodnesse of this Woman: All I can pay is nothing. Why vncall'd for?) Ent. Francis. Franc. It is of waight, Sir, that makes me thus presse Vpon your priuacies. Your constant friend The Marquisse of Pescara, tyr'd with hast, Hath businesse that concernes your life and fortunes, And with speed to impart. Sf. Waite on him hether; Ex. Franc. And deerest to thy Closet: Let thy prayers Assist my counsels. Marc. To spare imprecations Against my selfe; without you I am nothing. Ex. Marc. Sf. The Marquisse of Pescara; A great Souldior: And though he seru'd vpon the aduerse partie, Euer my constant friend. Enter Francisco, Pescara. Franc. Yonder he walkes, Full of sad thoughts. Pesc. Blame him not good Francisco, He hath much cause to grieue: Would I might end so, And not ad this, to feare. Sf. My deere Pescara: A miracle in these times, a friend and happie, Cleaues to a falling fortune. Pesc. If it were As well in my weake power, in act to raise it, As 'tis to beare a part of sorrow with you; You then should haue iust cause to say, Pescara Look'd not vpon your State, but on your Vertues, When he made suit to be writ in the List Of those you fauord. But my hast forbids All complement. Thus then, Sir, to the purpose. The cause that vnattended brought me hether, Was not to tell you of your losse, or danger; For Fame hath many Wings to bring ill tidings, And I presume you haue heard it: But to giue you such, Such friendly counsell, as perhaps may make Your sad disaster, lesse. Sf. You are all goodnesse, And I giue vp my selfe to be dispos'd of, As in your wisedome you thinke fit. Pesc. Thus then, Sir. To hope you can hold out against the Emperor, Were flatterie in your selfe, to your vndooing; Therefore, the safest course that you can take, Is, to giue vp your selfe to his discretion, Before you be compeld. For rest assur'd, A voluntarie yeelding may find grace, And will admit defence, at least excuse: But should you linger doubtfull, till his Powers Haue seas'd your Person, and Estates perforce, You must expect extreames. Sf. I vnderstand you, And I will put your counsell into act, And speedilie; I only will take order For some Domesticall affaires, that doe Concerne me neerely, and with the next Sun Ride with you; In the meane time, my best friend, Pray take your rest. Pesc. Indeed, I haue trauaild hard, And will embrace your counsell. Ex. Pescara. Sf. With all care, Attend my Noble friend. Stay you, Francisco, You see how things stand with me? Franc. To my griefe: And if the losse of my poore life could be A Sacrifise, to restore them, as they were, I willingly would lay it downe. Sf. I thinke so: For I haue euer found you true, and thankful, Which makes me loue the building I haue rays'd, In your aduancement: And repent no grace, I haue conferd vpon you: And beleeue me, Though now I should repeate my fauours to you, The Titles I haue giuen you, and the meanes Sutable to your Honours, that I thought you Worthy my Sister, and my Family, And in my Dukedome made you next my selfe: It is not to vpbraid you: But to tell you I find you are worthy of them in your loue, And seruice to me. Franc. Sir, I am your Creature: And any shape, that you would haue me weare, I gladly will put on. Sf. Thus, then Francisco; I now am to deliuer to your trust, A weightie secret: Of so strange a nature, And 'twill I know appeare so monstrous to you, That you will tremble in the execution, As much as I am tortur'd, to command it: For 'tis a deed so horrid, that but to heare it, Would strike into a Ruffian flesh'd in murthers, Or an obdurate Hang-man, soft compassion; And yet Francisco (of all Men the deerest, And from me most deseruing) such my state, And strange condition is, that thou alone, Must know the fatall seruice, and performe it. Franc. These preparations, Sir, to worke a stranger, Or to one, vnacquainted with your bounties, Might appeare vsefull: But to me, they are Needlesse impertinances: For, I dare doe, What e're you dare command. Sf. But thou must sweare it, And put into thy Oath, all ioyes, or torments That fright the wicked, or confirme the good: Not to conceale it only, that is nothing; But whensoe're my will shall speake, strike now: To fall vpon't like Thunder. Franc. Minister The Oath, in any way, or forme you please, I stand resolu'd to take it. Sf. Thou must doe then, What no maleuolent Star will dare to looke on, It is so wicked: For which, Men will curse thee, For being the Instrument: And the blest Angels, Forsake me at my need, for being the Author: For 'tis a deed of Night, of Night Francisco, In which the memorie of all good Actions, We can pretend too, shall be buried quick; Or if we be remembred, it shall be To fright posteritie, by our example: That haue out-gone all presidents of Villaines, That were before vs: And such as succeed, Though taught in hels black schoole, shal ne'er com nere vs. Art thou not shaken yet? Franc. I grant you moue me: But to a Man confirm'd; Sf. Ile try your temper: What thinke you of my Wife? Franc. As a thing Sacred: To whose faire Name, and memorie, I pay gladly These signes of dutie. Sf. Is she not the abstract Of all that's rare, or to be wish't in Woman? Franc. It were a kind of blasphemy to dispute it: But to the purpose Sir. Sf. Ad to her goodnesse, Her tendernesse of me, Her care to please me, Her vnsuspected chastity, nere equall'd: Her Innocence, her honor: O I am lost In the Ocean of her vertues, and her graces, When I thinke of them. Fran. Now I finde the end Of all your coniurations: there's some seruice To be done for this sweet Lady; If she haue enemies That she would haue remou'd? Sf. Alas Francisco, Her greatest enemy is her greatest louer, Yet in that hatred, her Idolater. One smile of hers would make a sauage tame; One accent of that tongue would calme the Seas, Though all the windes at once stroue there for Empire. Yet I, for whom she thinks all this too little, Should I miscarry in this present iourney, (From whence it is all number to a cypher, I ner'e returne with honor) by thy hand Must haue her murthered. Fra. Murther'd? Shee that loues so, And so deserues to be belou'd againe? And I, (who sometimes you were pleas'd to fauor) Pick'd out the instrument? Sf. Doe not flye off: What is decreed, can neuer be recal'd; 'Tis more than loue to her, that markes her out, A wish'd companion to me, in both fortunes: And strong assurance of thy zealous faith, That giues vp to thy trust a secret, that Racks should not haue forc'd from me. O Francisco: There is no heauen without her: nor a hell, Where she recides. I aske from her but iustice, And what I would haue payd to her: had sickenesse, Or any other accident diuorc'd, Her purer soule, from his vnspotted body. The slauish Indian Princes when they dye Are cheerefully attended to the fire, By the wife, and slaue, that liuing they lou'd best, To doe them seruice in another world: Nor will I be lesse honor'd, that loue more. And therefore trifle not, but in thy lookes, Expresse a ready purpose to performe, What I command, or by Marcelias soule, This is thy latest minute. Fran. 'Tis not feare Of death, but loue to you, makes me embrace it; But for mine owne security when 'tis done, What warrant haue I? If you please to signe one, I shall, though with vnwillingnesse and horror, Perform your dreadfull charge. Sf. I will Francisco; But still remember, that a Princes secrets Are balme, conceal'd: but poyson, if discouer'd. I may come backe; then this is but a tryall, To purchase thee, if it were possible, A neerer place in my affection; but I know thee honest. Fran. 'Tis a Character I will not part with. Sf. I may liue to reward it. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secun. ScÃ¦. Prima. Tiberio, Stephano. Ste. How? left the Court? Tib. Without guard or retinue Fitting a Prince. Ste. No enemy neere, to force him? To leaue his owne strengths, yet deliuer vp Himselfe, as 'twere in bonds, to the discretion Of him that hates him? 'Tis beyond example: You neuer heard the motiues that induc't him, To this strange course? Tib. No, those are Cabinet councels, And not to be communicated, but To such as are his owne, and sure; Alas, We fill vp emptie places, and in publique, Are taught to giue our suffrages to that, Which was before determin'd: And are safe so; Signiour Francisco (vpon whom alone His absolute power is with al strength confer'd, During his absence) can with ease resolue you. To me, they are Riddles. Steph. Well, he shall not be, My Oedipus, Ile rather dwell in darkenesse. But my good Lord Tiberio, This Francisco, Is, on the suddaine, strangely rays'd. Tib. O Sir, He tooke the thryuing course: He had a Sister, A faire one too; With whom (as it is rumor'd) The Duke was too familiar; But she cast off, (What promises soeuer past betweene them) Vpon the sight of this, forsooke the Court, And since was neuer seene; To smother this, (As Honors neuer faile to purchase silence) Francisco first was grac'd, and step by step, Is rais'd vp to this height. Steph. But how is his absence borne? Tib. Sadly, it seemes By the Dutches: For since he left the Court, For the most part, she hath kept her priuate Chamber, No visitants admitted; In the Church, She hath been seene to pay her pure deuotions, Season'd with teares: And sure her sorrow's ttue, Or deepely counterfeited; Pompe, and State, And brauerie cast off: And she that lately Riuald PoppÃ¦a in her varied shapes, Or the Ãgyptian Queene: Now, widow-like, In Sable coluors (as, her Husbands dangers, Strangled in her, the vse of any pleasure) Mournes for his absence. Steph. It becomes her Vertue, And does confirme, what was reported of her. Tib. You take it right; But on the other side, The darling of his Mother, Mariana, As there were an Antipathy, betweene Her, and the Dutches passions: And as Sh'ad no dependance on her brothers fortune, She ne're appear'd so full of mirth. Steph. 'Tis strange. But see, her fauorite: &amp; accompani'd, Ent. Graccho with fidlers To your report. Grac. You shall scrape, and Ile sing, A scuruie Dittie, to a scuruie tune, Repine who dares. Fidl. But if we should offend, The Dutches hauing silenc't vs: &amp; these Lords, Stand by to heare vs. Grac. They, in Name are Lords, But I am one in Power: And for the Dutches, But yester-day we were merrie for her pleasure, We now'l be for my Ladies. Tib. Signiour Graccho. Gr. A poore Man, Sir, a Seruant to the Princes: But you, great Lords, and Councellors of State, Whom I stand bound to reuerence. Tib. Come, we know You are a Man in grace. Grac. Fye, no: I grant, I beare my fortunes patiently: Serue the Princesse, And haue successe at all times to her closet, Such is my impudence: when your graue Lordships Are masters of the modesty, to attend Three houres, nay sometimes foure; and then bid waite Vpon her the next morning. Ste. He derides vs. Tib. Pray you, what newes is stirring? you know all. Grac. Who, I? alas, I haue no intelligence At home, nor abroad: I onely sometimes guesse The change of the times; I should ask of your Lordships Who are to keepe their Honors, who to loose 'em; Who the Duchesse smil'd on last, or on whom frown'd, You onely can resolue me: we poore waiters Deale (as you see) in mirth, and foolish fyddles: It is our element; and could you tell me, What point of State 'tis, that I am commanded To muster vp this musicke: on mine honesty, You should much befriend me. Ste. Sirra, you grow sawcie. Tib. And would be layd by the heeles. Grac. Not by your Lordships, Without a speciall warrant; looke to your owne stakes; Were I committed, here come those would baile me: Perhaps we might change places too. Tib. The Princesse; Ent. Isabella, Mariana. We must be patient. Ste. There's no contending. Tib. See, the informing rogue. Ste. That we should stoope To such a Mushrome. Mari. Thou dost mistake; they durst not Vse the least word of scorne, although prouok'd, To any thing of mine. Goe, get you home, And to your seruants, friends, and flatterers, number How many discents you are noble; Look to your wiues too, The smooth-chin'd Courtiers are abroad. Tib. No way, to be a Free-man? Ex. Tib. Steph. Grac. Your Excellence, hath the best guift to dispatch, These Arras pictures of Nobilitie, I euer read of. Mari. I can speake sometimes. Grac. And couer so your bitter Pills, with sweetnesse Of Princely language to forbid reply, They are greedily swallowed. Isab. But, the purpose Daughter, That brings vs hither? Is it to bestow A visit on this Woman? That, because She only would be thoght truly to grieue, The absence, and the dangers of my Son, Proclaimes a generall sadnesse? Mari. If to vexe her, May be interpreted to doe her Honor, She shall haue many of 'em? Ile make vse Of my short Raigne: my Lord, now gouernes all: And she shall know, that her Idolater, My Brother, being not by, now to protect her, I am her equall. Grac. Of a little thing, It is so full of Gall: A Diuell of this size, Should they run for a wager to be spitefull, Gets not a Hors-head of her. Mari. On her Birth-day, We were forc'd to be merrie: &amp; now she's musty We must be sad, on paine of her displeasure; We will, we will. This is her priuate Chamber, Where like an Hypocrite, not a true Turtle, She seemes to mourne her absent Mate, her Seruants Attending her like Mutes: But Ile speake to her And in a high Key too, play any thing That's light and loud enough but to torment her, And we will haue rare sport. Song. Marcelia aboue in blacke. Isab. She frownes, as if Her lookes could fright vs. Mari. May it please your greatnesse, We heard that your late Physicke hath not work'd, And that breeds Melancholy, as your Doctor tells vs: To purge which, we that are born your Highnesse Vassals, And are to play the fooles to doe you seruice, Present you with a fit of mirth: what thinke you Of a new Anticke? Isab. 'Twould show rare in Ladies. Mari. Being intended for so sweet a creature, Were she but pleas'd to grace it. Isab. Fye, she will, Be it nere so meane: shee's made of courtesie. Mari. The Mistresse of all hearts; one smile I pray you On your poore seruants, or a Fidlers fee: Comming from those faire hands, though but a Ducat, We will inshrine it as a holy relique. Isab. 'Tis Wormewood, and it workes. Marc. If I lay by My feares, and griefes (in which you should be sharers) If doting age could let you but remember, You haue a sonne; or frontlesse impudence, You are a sister; and in making answere, To what was most vnfit for you to speake, Or me to heare: borrow of my iust anger. Isab. A set speech on my life. Mari. Pen'd by her Chaplaine. Marce. Yes, it can speake, without instruction speake; And tell your want of manners, that y'are rude, And sawcily rude, too. Grac. Now the game begins. Marce. You durst not else on any hire or hope, (Remembring what I am, and whose I am) Put on the desperate boldnesse, to disturbe The least of my retirements. Mari. Note her now. Marc. For both shal vnderstand; though th'one presume Vpon the priuiledge due to a Mother, The Duke stands now on his owne legs, and needs No nurse to leade him. Isab. How, a Nurse? Marce. A dry one, And vselesse too: But I am mercifull, And dotage signes your pardon. Isab. I defie thee, Thee, and thy pardons, proud one. Marc. For you, Puppet. Mari. What, of me? Pine-tree. Marc. Little you are, I grant, And haue as little worth, but much lesse wit, You durst not else, the Duke being wholly mine, His power and honour mine, and the alleageance, You owe him, as a Subiect, due to me. Mari. To you? Marc. To me: And therefore as a Vassal, From this houre learne to serue me, or, you'l feele, I must make vse of my authoritie, And as a Princesse punish it. Isab. A Princesse? Mari. I had rather be a Slaue vnto a Moore, Than know thee for my equall. Isab. Scornefull thing, Proud of a white Face. Mari. Let her but remember The Issue in her Legge: Isab. The charge, she puts The State too, for Perfumes. Mari. And, howsoe're She seemes, when she's made vp: As she's her selfe, She stinkes aboue ground. O that I could reach you, The little one you scorne so, with her nayles, Would teare your painted Face, &amp; scratch those Eyes out. Doe but come downe. Marc. Were there no other way, But leaping on thy Neck, to breake mine owne, Rather than be outbrau'd thus. Grac. Fourtie Ducats Vpon the little Hen: She's of the kind, And will not leaue the Pit. Mari. That it were lawfull To meete her with a Ponyard, and a Pistoll; Ent. Marc. below. But these weake hands shall shew my spleene. Marc. Where are you? You Modicum, you Dwarfe. Mari. Here, Giantesse, here. Ent. Francisco. Tib. Steph. Franc. A tumult in the Court? Mari. Let her come on. Franc. What winde hath rais'd this tempest? Seuer 'em, I command you. What's the cause? Speake Mariana. Mari. I am out of breath; But we shall meete, we shall. And doe you heare, Sir, Or right me on this Monster (she's three foote Too high for a Woman) or ne're looke to haue, A quiet houre with me. Isab. If my Sonne were here, And would endure this; May a Mothers curse Persue, and ouertake him. Franc. O forbeare, In me he's present, both in power, and will; And Madam, I much grieue, that in his absence, There should arise the least distaste to moue you: It being his principall, nay only charge, To haue you in his absence seru'd, and honour'd, As when himselfe perform'd the willing Office. Mari. This is fine, yfaith. Grac. I would I were well off. Franc. And therefore, I beseech you Madam, frowne not (Till most vnwittingly he hath deseru'd it) On your poore Seruant; To your Excellence, I euer was, and will be such: And lay, The Dukes authoritie, trusted to me, With willingnesse at your feet. Mari. O base. Isab. We are like To haue an equall Iudge. Franc. But should I finde That you are touc'd in any point of Honor, Or that the least neglect is falne vpon you, I then stand vp a Prince. Fidl. Without reward, Pray you dismisse vs. Grac. Would I were fiue Leagues hence. Franc. I will be partial to none, not to my selfe, Be you but pleas'd to shew me my offence, Or if you hold me in your good opinion, Name those that haue offended you. Isab. I am one, And I will iustifie it. Mari. Thou art a base Fellow, To take her part. Franc. Remember, she's the Dutchesse. Marc. But vs'd with more contempt, than if I were A Peasants Daughter: Bayted, and hooted at Like to a common Strumpet: With lowd noyses, Forc'd from my prayers: And my priuate Chamber (Which with all willingnesse I would make my Prison During the absence of my Lord) deni'd me. But if he e're returne. Franc. Were you an Actor, In this lewd Comedie? Mari. I marrie was I, And will be one againe. Isab. I'le ioyne with her, Though you repine at it. Franc. Thinke not then, I speake (For I stand bound to honour, and to serue you) But that the Duke, that liues in this great Lady, For the contempt of him, in her, commands you To be close Prisoners. Isab., Mari. Prisoners? Franc. Beare them hence. This is your charge my Lord Tiberio. And Stephano, this is yours. Marce. I am not cruell, But pleas'd they may haue libertie. Isab. Pleas'd, with a mischiefe. Mari. I'le rather liue in any loathsome Dungeon, Than in a Paradice, at her intreatie: And, for you vpstart. Steph. There is no contending. Tib. What shall become of these? Franc. See them well whip'd, As you will answere it. Tib. Now Signiour Graccho, What thinke you of your greatnesse? Grac. I preach patience, And must endure my fortune. Exe. omnes, preter. Fra. &amp; Marcel. Fidl. I was neuer yet At such a hunts-vp, nor was so rewarded. Fr. Let them first know themselues, &amp; how you are To be seru'd, and honour'd: Which, when they confesse, You may againe receiue them to your fauour: And then it will shew nobly. Marce. With my thankes, The Duke shall pay you his, If he returne To blesse vs with his presence. Franc. There is nothing That can be added to your faire acceptance: That is the prize, indeed: All else, are blankes, And of no value. As in vertuous actions, The vndertaker finds a full reward, Although confer'd vpon vnthankefull Men; So, any seruice done to so much sweetnesse, (Howeuer dangerous, and subiect to An ill construction) in your fauour finds A wish'd, and glorious end. Marce. From you, I take this As loyall dutie, but in any other, It would appeare grosse flatterie. Franc. Flatterie, Madam? You are so rare, and excellent in all things, And rais'd so high vpon a Rock of goodnesse, As that vice cannot reach you: who, but looks on This Temple built by Nature to Perfection, But must bow to it: and out of that zeale, Not only learne to adore it, but to loue it. Marce. Whither will this fellow? Franc. Pardon therefore Madam, If an excesse in me of humble dutie, Teach me to hope (and though it be not in The power of Man to merit such a blessing) My pietie (for it is more than loue) May find reward. Marce. You haue it in my thankes: And on my hand, I am pleas'd, that you shal take A full possession of it. But take heed, That you fixe here, and feed no hope beyond it; If you doe, 'twill proue fatall. Franc. Be it death, And death with torments, Tyrants neuer found out: Yet I must say I loue you. Marce. As a Subiect, And 'twill become you. Franc. Farewell circumstance: And since you are not pleas'd to vnderstand me, But by a plaine, and vsuall forme of speech: All superstitious reuerence lay'd by, I loue you as a Man, and as a Man I would enioy you. Why do you start, and flye me? I am no Monster, and you but a Woman: A Woman made to yeeld, and by example Told it is lawfull; Fauours of this nature, Are, in our age, no miracles in the greatest: And therefore Ladyâ Marce. Keepe of. O you Powers! Libidinous Beast, and ad to that vnthankfull (A crime, which Creatures wanting reason, flye from) Are all the Princely bounties, fauours, honours, Which (with some preiudice to his owne wisedome) Thy Lord, and Rayser hath confer'd vpon thee, In three dayes absence buried? Hath he made thee (A thing obscure, almost without a name) The enuie of great Fortunes? Haue I grac'd thee, Beyond thy rancke? And entertain'd thee, as A Friend, and not a Seruant? And is this, This impudent attempt to taint mine Honour, The faire returne of both our ventur'd fauours? Franc. Heare my excuse. Marce. The Diuell may plead mercie, And with as much assurance, as thou yeeld one. Burnes Lust so hot in thee? Or, is thy pride Growne vp to such a height, that, but a Princesse, No Woman can content thee? And ad to that, His Wife, and Princesse, to whom thou art ti'de In all the bonds of Dutie? Reade my life, And finde one act of mine so loosely carried, That could inuite a most selfe-louing Foole, Set of, with all that fortune could throw on him, To the least hope to find way to my fauour: And (what's the worst mine enemies could wish me) I'le be thy Strumpet. Franc. 'Tis acknowledg'd Madam, That your whole course of life hath been a patterne For chast, and vertuous Women; In your beautie (Which I first saw, and lou'd) as a faire Cristall, I read your heauenly mind, cleere and vntainted; And while the Duke did prize you to your valew (Could it haue been in Man to pay that dutie) I well might enuie him, but durst not hope To stop you, in your full carreer of goodnesse: But now I find, that he's falne from his fortune, And (howsoeuer he would appeare doting) Growne cold in his affection: I presume, From his most barbarous neglect of you, To offer my true seruice: Nor stand I bound, To looke back on the curtesies of him, That, of all liuing Men, is most vnthankfull. Marce. Vnheard of impudence! Franc. You'l say I am modest, When I haue told the Storie. Can he taxe me (That haue receiu'd some worldly trifles from him) For being ingratefull? When, he that first tasted, And hath so long enioy'd your sweet embraces (In which, all blessings that our fraile condition Is capable of, is wholy comprehended) As cloy'd with happinesse, contemnes the giuer. Of his felicitie? And, as he reach'd not, The master-peice of mischiefe, which he aymes at, Vnlesse he pay those fauours he stands bound to, With fell and deadly hate? You thinke he loues you, With vnexampled feruor: Nay, dotes on you, As there were something in you more than Woman: When on my knowledge, he long since hath wish'd, You were among the dead: And I, you scorne so, Perhaps, am your preseruer. Marce. Blesse me good Angels, Or I am blasted. Lyes so false, and wicked, And fashion'd to so damnable a purpose, Cannot be spoken by a humane tongue. My Husband, hate me? Giue thy selfe the Lye, False, and accurs'd; Thy Soule (if thou hast any) Can witnesse, neuer Lady stood so bound, To the vnfained affection of her Lord, As I doe, to my Sforza. If thou would'st worke Vpon my weake credulitie, Tell me rather, That the Earth moues; The Sunne, and Starres, stand still; The Ocean keeps nor Floods, nor Ebbes; Or that, Ther's peace betweene the Lyon, and the Lambe; Or that, the rauenous Eagle, and the Doue, Keepe in one Ayery, and bring vp their yong: Or any thing that is auerse to Nature: And I will sooner credit it, than that My Lord can thinke of me, but as a Iewell, He loues more than himselfe, and all the World. Franc. O Innocence, abus'd! Simplicitie cousen'd! It were a sinne, for which we haue no name, To keepe you longer in this wilfull errour. Reade his affection here; And then obserue How deere he holds you; 'Tis his Character, Which cunning yet, could neuer counterfeit. Marce. 'Tis his hand, I am resolu'd of't. I'le try what the Inscription is. Fran. Pray you doe so. Marc. You know my pleasure, &amp; the houre of Marcelias death, which faile not to execute, as you will answere the contrarie, not with your Head alone, but with the ruine of your whole Famely. And this written with mine owne Hand, and Signed with my priuie Signet, shall be your sufficient Warrant. Lodouico Sforza. I doe obey it, euerie word's a Poynard, And reaches to my Heart. She swones. Fran. What haue I done? Madam, for Heauens sake, Madam. O my Fate! I'le bend her body: This is yet some pleasure, I'le kisse her into a new life. Deare Lady: She stirs: For the Dukes sake, for Sforza's sake. Marc. Sforzas? Stand off: Though dead, I will be his, And euen my Ashes shall abhorre the touch Of any other. O vnkind, and cruell. Learne Women, learne to trust in one another; There is no faith in Man: Sforza is false, False to Marcelia. Franc. But I am true, And liue to make you happie. All the Pompe, State, and obseruance you had being his, Compar'd to what you shall enioy when mine, Shall be no more remembred. Loose his memory, And looke with chearefull beames on your new Creature: And know what he hath plotted for you good, Fate cannot alter. If the Emperour, Take not his life, at his returne he dyes, And by my Hand: My Wife, that is his Heire, Shall quickly follow; Then we Raigne alone, For with this Arme I'le swim through Seas of blood, Or make a Bridge, arch'd with the bones of Men, But I will graspe my aymes in you my deerest, Deerest, and best of Women. Marc. Thou art a Villaine? All attributes of Arch-Villaines made into one, Cannot expresse thee. I preferre the hate Of Sforza, though it marke me for the Graue, Before thy base affection. I am yet Pure, and vnspotted, in my true loue to him; Nor shall it be corrupted, though he's tainted; Nor will I part with Innocence, because He is found guiltie. For thy selfe, thou art A thing, that equall with the Diuell himselfe, I doe detest, and scorne. Franc. Thou then art nothing: Thy life is in my power, disdainefull Woman: Thinke on't, and tremble. Marc. No, though thou wert now To play thy hangmans part. Thou well may'st be My Executioner, and art only fit For such employment; But ne're hope to haue, The least grace from me. I will neuer see thee, But as the shame of Men: So, with my curses Of horror to thy Conscience in this life; And paines in Hell hereafter: I spit at thee, And making hast to make my peace with heauen, Expect thee as my Hangman. Ex. Marc. Franc. I am lost, In the discouerie of this fatall secret. Curs'd hope that flatter'd me, that wrongs could make her A stranger to her goodnesse; All my plots Turne backe vpon my selfe; But I am in, And must goe on: And since I haue put off From the Shoare of Innocence, guilt be now my Pilot. Reuenge first wrought me, Murther's his Twin-brother, One deadly sin then helpe to cure another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Terc. ScÃ¦. Prima. Enter Medina, Hernando, Alphonso. Med. The spoyle, the spoyle, 'tis that the soldior fights for; Our victorie as yet affords vs nothing, But wounds, and emptie honor. We haue past The hazard of a dreadfull day, and forc'd A passage with our Swords, through all the dangers, That Page like waite on the successe of warre; And now expect reward. Hern. Hell put it in The Enemies mind to be desperate, and hold out: Yeeldings, and compositions will vndoe vs; And what is that way giuen, for the most part, Comes to the Emperours Coffers, to defray The charge of the great action (as 'tis rumor'd) When vsually, some Thing in Grace (that ne're heard The Canons roring tongue, but at a Triumph) Puts in, and for his intercession shares, All that we fought for: The poore Soldior left To starue, or fill vp Hospitalls. Alph. But when We enter Townes by force, and carue our selues, Pleasure with pillage, and the richest Wines, Open our shrunke-vp vaines, and poure into 'em New blood, and feruor. Med. I long to be at it; To see these Chuffes, that euerie day may spend A Soldiors entertainement for a yeere, Yet make a third meale of a bunch of Raysons; These Spunges, that suck vp a Kingdomes fat (Batning like Scarabes in the nung of Peace) To be squees'd out by the rough hand of warre; And all that their whole liues haue heap'd together, By cous'nage, periurie, or sordid thrift, With one gripe to be rauishd. Her. I would be towsing Their faire Madona's, that in little Dogges, Monkeis, and Paraquito's consume thousands; Yet for the aduancement of a noble action, Repine to part with a poore Peice of Eight: Warres plagues vpon 'em: I haue seene 'em stop Their scornefull noses first, then seeme to swone At sight of a buffe Ierkin; if it were not Persum'd, and hid with Gold; Yet these nice wantons, (Spurd on by Lust, couer'd in some disguise, To meete some rough Court Stalion, and be leap'd) Durst enter into any common Brothell, Though all varieties of stinke contend there; Yet prayse the entertainment. Med. I may liue, To see the tatteredst Raskals of my troupe, Drag 'em out of their Closets, with a vengeance: When neither threatning, flattering, kneeling, howling, Can ransome one poore Iewell, or redeeme Themselues, from their blunt woing. Her. My maine hope is, To begin the sport at Millaine: Ther's enough, And of all kinds of pleasure we can wish for, To satisfie the most couetous. Alph. Euerie day We looke for a remoue. Med. For Lodowick Sforza The Duke of Millaine, I, on mine owne knowledge, Can say thus much; He is too much a Soldior, Too confident of his owne worth, too rich to; And vnderstands too well, the Emperor hates him, To hope for composition. Alph. On my life, We need not feere his comming in. Her. On mine, I doe not wish it: I had rather that To shew his valor, he'd put vs to the trouble To fetch him in by the Eares. Med. The Emperor. Enter Charles the Emperor, Pescara, &amp;c. Attendants. Charl. You make me wonder (Nay it is no councell, You may pertake it Gentlemen) who would haue thought, That he that scorn'd our proffer'd amitie, When he was sued to; should, ere he be summond, (Whither perswaded to it by base feare, Or flatter'd by false hope, which, 'tis vncertaine) First kneele for mercie? Med. When your Maiestie, Shall please to instruct vs, who it is, we may Admire it with you. Charl. Who, but the Duke of Millaine, The right Hand of the French: Of all that stand In our displeasure, whom necessitie Compels to seeke our fauour, I would haue sworne Sforza had been the last. Her. And should be writ so, In the list of those you pardon. Would his Citie Had rather held vs out a Seidge like Troy, Then by a fein'd submission, he should cheate you Of a iust reuenge: Or vs, of those faire glories We haue sweat blood to purchase. Med. With your honour You cannot heare him. Alph. The sack alone of Millaine Will pay the Armie. Charl. I am not so weake, To be wrought on as you feare; Nor ignorant, That Money is the sinew of the Warre; And what termes soeuer he seeke peace, 'Tis in our power to grant it, or denie it. Yet for our glorie, and to shew him that We haue brought him on his knees; It is resolu'd To heare him as a Supplyant. Bring him in; But let him see the effects of our iust anger, In the Guard that you make for him. Ex. Piscara Hern. I am now Familiar with the issue (all plagues on it) He will appeare in some deiected habit, His countenance sutable; And for his order, A Rope about his neck; Then kneele, and tell Old Stories, what a worthy thing it is To haue power, and not to vse it; Then ad to that A Tale of King Tigranes, and great Pompey, Who said (forsooth, and wisely) 'Twas more honor To make a King, then kill one: Which, applyed To the Emperor, and himselfe, a Pardons granted To him, an Enemie; and we his Seruants, Condemn'd to beggerie. Med. Yonder he comes, En. Sforza But not as you expected. Alph. He lookes, as if He would out-face his dangers. Hern. I am cousen'd: A suitor in the Diuels name. Med. Heare him speake. Sf. I come not (Emperor) to inuade thy mercie, By fawning on thy fortune; Nor bring with me Excuses, or denials. I professe (And with a good Mans confidence, euen this instant, That I am in thy power) I was thine enemie; Thy deadly and vow'd enemie; One that wish'd Confusion to thy Person and Estates; And with my vtmost powers, and deepest counsels (Had they been truely followed) further'd it: Nor will I now, although my neck were vnder The Hang-mans Axe, with one poore sillable Confesse, but that I honor'd the French King, More then thy selfe, and all Men. Med. By Saint Iaques, This is no flatterie. Her. There is Fire, and Spirit in't; But not long liu'd, I hope. Sf. Now giue me leaue, (My hate against thy selfe, and loue to him Freely acknowledg'd) to giue vp the reasons That made me so affected. In my wants I euer found him faithfull; Had supplyes Of Men and Moneys from him; And my hopes Quite sunke, were by his Grace, bouy'd vp againe: He was indeed to me, as my good Angell, To guard me from all dangers. I dare speake (Nay must and will) his prayse now, in as high And lowd a key, as when he was thy equall. The benefits he sow'd in me, met not Vnthankefull ground, but yeelded him his owne With faire encrease, and I still glorie in it. And though my fortunes (poore, compar'd to his, And Millaine waigh'd with France, appeare as nothing) Are in thy furie burnt: Let it be mentioned, They seru'd but as small Tapers to attend The solemne flame at this great Funerall: And with them I will gladly wast my selfe, Rather then vndergoe the imputation, Of being base, or vnthankefull. Alph. Nobly spoken. Her. I doe begin, I know not why, to hate him Lesse then I did. Sf. If that then to be gratefull For curtesies receiu'd; Or not to leaue A friend in his necessities, be a crime Amongst you Spaniards (which other Nations That like your aym'd at Empire, lou'd, and cherish'd Where e're they found it) Sforza brings his Head To pay the forfeit; Nor come I as a Slaue, Piniond and fetterd, in a squallid weed, Falling before thy Feet, kneeling and howling, For a forestal'd remission; That were poore, And would but shame thy victorie: For conquest Ouer base foes, is a captiuitie, And not a triumph. I ne're fear'd to dye, More then I wish'd to liue. When I had reach'd My ends in being a Duke, I wore these Robes, This Crowne vpon my Head, and to my side This Sword was girt; And witnesse truth, that now 'Tis in anothers power when I shall part With them and life together, I am the same, My Veines then did not swell with pride; nor now, They shrinke for feare: Know Sir, that Sforza stands Prepar'd for either fortune. Her. As I liue, I doe begin strangely to loue this fellow; And could part with three quarters of my share In the promis'd spoyle, to saue him. Sf. But if example Of my fidelitie to the French (whose honours, Titles, and glories, are now mixt with yours; As Brookes deuowr'd by Riuers, loose their names) Has power to inuite you to make him a friend, That hath giuen euident proofe, he knowes to loue, And to be thankefull; This my Crowne, now yours, You may restore me: And in me instruct These braue Commanders (should your fortune change, Which now I wish not) what they may expect, From noble enemies for being faithfull. The charges of the warre I will defray, And what you may (not without hazard) force, Bring freely to you: I'le preuent the cryes Of murther'd Infants, and of rauish'd Mayds, Which in a Citie sack'd call on Heauens justice, And stop the course of glorious victories. And when I know the Captaines and the Soldiors, That haue in the late battle, done best seruice, And are to be rewarded; I, my selfe (According to their quallitie and merrits) Will see them largely recompenc'd. I haue said, And now expect my sentence. Alph. By this light, 'Tis a braue Gentleman. Med. How like a block The Emperor sits? Her. He hath deliuer'd reasons, Especially in his purpose to enrich Such as fought brauely (I my selfe am one, I care not who knowes it) as, I wonder, that He can be so stupid. Now he begins to stirre, Mercie an't be thy will. Charl. Thou hast so farre Outgone my expectation, noble Sforza (For such I hold thee) And true constancie, Rais'd on a braue foundation, beares such palme, And priuiledge with it; That where we behold it, Though in an enemie, it does command vs To loue and honour it. By my future hopes, I am glad, for thy sake, that in seeking fauour, Thou did'st not borrow of vice her indirect, Crooked, and abiect meanes: And for mine owne, (That since my purposes must now be chang'd Touching thy life and fortunes) the world cannot Taxe me of leuitie, in my setled councels; I being neither wrought by tempting bribes, Nor seruile flatterie; but forc'd vnto it, By a faire warre of vertue. Hern. This sounds well. Charl. All former passages of hate be buried; For thus with open armes I meete thy loue, And as a friend embrace it: And so farre I am from robbing thee of the least honor, That with my hands, to make it sit the faster, I set thy Crowne once more vpon thy head: And doe not only stile thee, Duke of Millaine, But vow to keepe thee so: Yet not to take From others to giue only to my selfe, I will not hinder your magnificence To my Commanders, neither will I vrge it, But in that, as in all things else I leaue you To be your owne disposer Florish. Ex. Charl. Sf. May I liue To seale my loyaltie, though with losse of life In some braue seruice worthy CÃ¦sars fouor, And I shall dye most happy. Gentlemen, Receiue me to your loues, and if henceforth There can arise a difference betweene vs, It shall be in a Noble emulation. Who hath the fairest Sword, or dare go farthest, To fight for Charles the Emperor? Hern. We embrace you, As one well read in all the points of honor, And there we are your Schollers. Sf. True, but such As farre out-strip the Master; we'le contend In loue hereafter, in the meane time pray you, Let me discharge my debt, and as in earnest Of what's to come, deuide this Cabnet: In the small body of it there are Iewels, Will yeeld a hundred thousand Pistolets, Which honor me to receiue. Med. You bind vs to you. Sf. And when great Charles comands me to his presence, If you will please to excuse my abrupt departure, Designes that most concerne me next this mercie, Calling me home, I shall hereafter meete you, And gratifie the fauor. Her. In this and all things, we are your Seruants. Sf. A name I euer owe you. Ex. Med. Her. Alph. Pesc. So Sir, this tempest is well ouerblowne, And all things fall out to our wishes. But In my opinion, this quicke returne, Before you haue made a partie in the Court Among the great ones (for these needy Captains Haue little power in peace) may beget danger, At least suspition. Sf. Where true honor liues, Doubt hath no being, I desire no pawne Beyond an Emperors word for my assurance: Besides, Pescara, to thy selfe of all men I will confesse my weakenesse, though my State And Crown's restored me, though I am in grace And that a little stay might be a step To greater honors, I must hence. Alas, I liue not here, my wife, my wife Pescara, Being absent I am dead. Prethe excuse, And do not chide for freindship sake my fondnes But ride along with me, I'le giue you reasons, And strong ones, to plead for me. Pesc. Vse you owne pleasure, I'le bere you companie. Sf. Farewell griefe, I am stor'd with Two blessings most desir'd in humaine life, A constant friend, an vnsuspected wife. ScÃ¦. Secunda. Enter Graccho, Officer. Offic. What I did, I had warrant for; you haue tasted My Office gently, and for those soft strokes, Flea bitings to the Ierks I could haue lent you, There does belong a feeling. Grac. Must I pay For being tormented and dishonor'd? Off. Fye no, Your honours not empar'd in't: What's the letting out Of a little corrupt blood, and the next way too? There is no Chirurgion like me to take off A Courtiers Itch that's rampant at great Ladies, Or turnes knaue for preferment, or growes proud Of their rich Clokes, and Sutes, though got by brokage, And so forgets his betters. Grac. Verie good Sir, But am I the first man of qualitie, That e're came vnder your fingers? Off. Not by a thousand, And they haue said I haue a luckie hand to, Both men and women of all sorts haue bow'd Vnder this scepter. I haue had a fellow That could indite forsooth, and make fine meeters To tinckle in the eares of ignorant Madams, That for defaming of great Men, was sent me Thredbare and lowsie, and in three dayes after Discharged by another that set him on, I haue seene him Cap a pe gallant, and his stripes wash'd of With oyle of Angels. Grac. 'Twas a soueraigne cure, Off. There was a Secretarie to, that would not be Conformable to the Orders of the Church, Nor yeeld to any argument or reason, But still rayle at authoritie, brought to me, When I had worm'd his tongue, and trussed his hanches, Grew a fine Pulpet man, and was benefic'd. Had he not cause to thanke me? Grac. There was phisicke Was to the purpose. Off. Now for women, For your more consolation, I could tell you Twentie fine stories, but I'le end in one, And 'tis the last that's memorable. Grac. Prethe doe, For I grow wearie of thee. Off. There was lately A fine she waiter in the Court, that doted Extreamely of a Gentleman, that had His maine dependance on a Signiors fauor (I will not name) but could not compasse him On any tearmes. This wanton at dead midnight Was found at the exercise behind the Arras With the 'foresaid Signior; he got cleare off, But she was seis'd on, and to saue his honor, Indur'd the lash; And though I made her often Curuet and caper, she would neuer tell, Who play'd at push-pin with her. Grac. But what follow'd? Prethe be briefe. Off. Why this Sir, she deliuered, Had store of Crownes assign'd her by her patron, Who forc'd the Gentleman to saue her credit, To marie her, and say he was the partie Found in Lobs pound. So, she that before gladly Would haue been his whore, raignes o're him as his wife, Nor dares he grumble at it. Speake but truth then, Is not my Office luckie? Grac. Goe, ther's for thee, But what will be my fortune? Off. If you thriue not After that soft correction, come againe. Grac. I thanke you knaue. Off. And then knaue, I will fit you. Ex. Officer. Grac. Whipt like a rogue? no lighter punishment striue To ballance with a little mirth: 'Tis well, My credit sunke for euer, I am now Fit companie, only for Pages and for foot boyes, That haue perused the Porters Lodge. Enter two Gentlemen. 1. Gentlem. See Iulio, Yonder the proud slaue is, how he lookes now After his castigation? 2. Gentlem. As he came From a close fight at Sea vnder the Hatches, With a she Dunckerke, that was shot before Betweene winde and weather, And he hath sprung a leake too, or I'me cousen'd. 1. Gentlem. Lets be merie with him. Grac. How they stare at me? am I turn'd to an Owle? The wonder Gentlemen? 2. Gentlem. I read this morning Strange stories of the passiue fortitude Of men in former ages, which I thought Impossible, and not to be beleeued. But now I looke on you, my wonder ceases. Grac. The reason Sir? 2. Gentlem. Why Sir you haue been whip'd Whip'd signior Graccho. And the whip I take it, Is to a Gentleman, the greatest tryall That may be of his patience. Grac. Sir, I'le call you To a strickt account for this. 2. Gentlem. I'le not deale with you, Vnlesse I haue a Beadle for my second. And then I'le answere you. 1. Gentlem. Farewell poore Graccho. Ex. Gentlem. Grac. Better and better still, If euer wrongs Could teach a wretch to find the way to vengence, Hell now inspire me. How, the Lord Protector! Enter Franc. &amp; Seruant My Iudge I thank him. Whether thus in priuate, I will not see him. Franc. If I am sought for, Say I am indispos'd, and will not heare, Or suits, or sutors. Seru. But Sir, if the Princes Enquire, what shall I answere? Franc. Say, I am rid Abrode to take the ayre, but by no meanes Let her know I am in Court. Seru. So I shall tell her. Ex. seruant Franc. Within there, Ladies. Ent. a Gentlewoman Gentlew. My good Lord, your pleasure? Franc. Prethe let me begge thy fauor for accesse To the Dutches. Gentlew. In good sooth my Lord I dare not, She's verie priuate. Franc. Come ther's gold to buy thee A new gowne, and a rich one. This will tempt me. Gentlew. I once swore If e're I lost my maiden-head, it should be With a great Lord as you are, and I know not how, I feele a yeelding inclination in me, If you haue appitite. Franc. Poxe on thy maiden-head, Where is thy Lady? Gentlew. If you venter on her, She's walking in the Gallerie, perhaps You will find her lesse tractable. Franc. Bring me to her. Gentlew. I feare you'l haue cold entertainment, when You are at your iourneys end, and 'twere discretion To take a snatch by the way. Franc. Prethe leaue fooling, My page waites in the lobbie, giue him sweet meats, He is trayn'd vp for his Masters ease, And he will coole thee. Ex. Franc. &amp; Gentlew. Grac. A braue discouerie beyond my hope, A plot euen offer'd to my hand to worke on, If I am dull now, may I liue and dye The scorne of wormes &amp; slaues, let me consider, My Lady and her Mother first committed In the fauor of the Dutches, and I whip'd, That with an Iron pen is writ in brasse On my tough hart, now growne a harder mettal, And all his brib'd approches to the Dutches To be conceal'd, good, good, This to my Lady, Deliuer'd as I'le order it, runs her mad. But this may proue but courtship, let it be I care not so it feed her Iealousie. Ex. ScÃ¦. Ter. Enter Marcelia, Francisco. Marc. Beleeue thy teares or oathes? Can it be hop'd, After a practice so abhor'd and horred, Repentance e're can find thee? Franc. Deere Lady, Great in your fortune, greater in your goodnes, Make a superlatiue of excellence, In being greatest in your sauing mercie. I doe confesse, humbly confesse my fault, To be beyond all pittie; my attempt, So barberously rude, that it would turne A saint-like patience, into sauage furie: But you that are all innocence and vertue, No spleane or anger in you of a woman, But when a holy zeale to pietie fires you, May, if you please, impute the fault to loue, Or call it beastly lust, for 'tis no better A sinne, a monstrous sinne, yet with it, many That did proue good men after, haue bin t?pted, And thogh I am croked now, 'tis in your powre To make me straight againe. Marc. Is't possible This can be cunning? Franc. But if no submission, Nor prayers can appease you, that you may know, 'Tis not the feare of death that makes me sue thus, But a loathed detestation of my madnesse, Which makes me wish to liue to haue your pardon. I will not waite the sentence of the Duke (Since his returne is doubtfull) but I my selfe Will doe a fearefull iustice on my selfe, No witnesse by but you, there being no more When I offended: yet before I doe it, For I perceiue in you no signes of mercie, I will disclose a secret, which dying with me, May proue your ruine. Marc. Speake it, it will take from The burthen of thy conscience. Franc. Thus then Madam, The warrant by my Lord sign'd for your death, Was but conditionall, but you must sweare By your vnspotted truth, not to reueale it, Or I end here abruptly. Marc. By my hopes Of ioyes hereafter, on. Franc. Nor was it hate That forc'd him to it, but excesse of loue, And if I e're returne, so said great Sforza, No liuing man deseruing to enioy My best Marcelia. With the first newes That I am dead, for no man after me Might e're enioy her, but till certaine proofe Assure thee I am lost (these were his words) âFaile not to kill her Obserue and honor her as if the seale Of womans goodnesse only dwelt in hers. This trust I haue abus'd and basely wrong'd, And if the excelling pittie of your mind Cannot forgiue it, as I dare not hope it, Rather then looke on my offended Lord, I stand resolu'd to punish it. Marc. Hold, 'tis forgiuen, And by me freely pardned. In thy faire life. Hereafter studie to deserue this bountie With thy true penitence (such I beleeue it) Against my resolution hath forc'd from me, But that my Lord, my Sforza should esteeme, My life fit only as a page, to waite on The various course of his vncertaine fortunes, Or cherish in himselfe that sensuall hope In death to know me as a wife, afflicts me, Nor does his enuie lesse deserue my anger, Which though such is my loue, I would not nourish, Will slack the ardor that I had to see him Returne in safetie. Franc. But if your entertainment Should giue the least ground to his iealousie, To raise vp an opinion I am false, You then distroy your mercie. Therfore Madam (Though I shall euer looke on you as on My liues preseruer, and the miracle Of human pitty) would you but vouchsafe, In companie to doe me those faire graces And fauors which your innocencie and honor May safely warrant, it would to the Duke (I being to your best selfe alone known guiltie) Make me appeare most innocent. Marc. Haue your wishes, And some thing I may doe to try his temper, At least to make him know a constant wife, Is not so slau'd to her husbands doting humors, But that she may deserue to liue a widow, Her fate appointing it. Franc. It is enough, Shout, and Floursh Nay all I could desire, and will make way To my reuenge, which shall disperse it selfe On him, on her, and all. Ent. Tiberio &amp; Stephano Marc. What shout is that? Tib. All happines to the Dutches, that may flow From the Dukes new and wish'd returne. Marc. He's welcome. Steph. How coldly she receiues it. Tib. Obserue their encounter. Flourish. Ent. Sforza, Pescaria, Isabella, Mariana, Graccho &amp; the rest. Mar. What you haue told me Graccho is beleeu'd, And I'le find time to stur in't. Grac. As you see cause, I will not doe ill offices. Sf. I haue stood Silent thus long Marcelia, expecting When with more then a greedie hast thou would'st Haue flowne into my armes, and on my lippes Haue printed a deepe welcome. My desire To glaze my selfe in these faire eyes, haue borne me With more then human speede. Nor durst I stay In any Temple, or to any saint To pay my vowes and thankes for my returne, Till I had seene thee. Marc. Sir, I am most happie To looke vpon you safe, and would expresse My loue and duty in a modest fashion, Such as might sute with the behauior Of one that knowes her selfe a wife, and how To temper her desires, not like a wanton Fierd with hot appetite, nor can it wrong me To loue discreetly. Sf. How, why can there be A meane in your affections to Sforza? Or any act though neare so loose that may Inuite or heighten appetite, appeare Immodest or vncomly. Doe not moue me, My passions to you are in extreames, And know no bounds, come kisse me. Marc. I obey you. Sf. By all the ioyes of loue, she does salute me As if I were her grand-father. What witch, With cursed spels hath quench'd the amorous heat That liued vpon these lips? Tell me Marcellia, And truly tell me, is't a fault of mine That hath begot this coldnesse, or neglect Of others in my absence? Marc. Neither Sir, I stand indebted to your substitute, Noble and good Francisco for his care, And faire obseruance of me: There was nothing With which you being present could supply me, That I dare say I wanted. Sf. How! Marc. The pleasures That sacred Hymen warrants vs excepted, Of which in troth you are too great a doter, And there is more of beast in it then man. Let vs loue temperatly, things violent last not, And too much dotage rather argues folly Then true affection. Grac. Obserue but this, And how she prays'd my Lords care and obseruance, And then iudge Madam if my intelligence Haue any ground of truth. Mari. No more, I marke it. Steph. How the Duke stands? Tib. As he were routed there, And had no motion. Pesc. My Lord, from whence Growes this amazement? Sf. It is more deare my friend, For I am doubtfull whether I haue a being, But certaine that my lifes a burthen to me, Take me bake good Pescara, show me to CÃ¦sar, In all his rage and furie I discliame His mercie, to liue now which is his guift, Is worse then death, and with all studied torments. Marcellia is vnkind, nay worse, growne cold In her affection, my excesse of feruor, Which it was neuer equal'd, growne distastfull. But haue thy wishes woman, thou shalt know That I can be my selfe, and thus shake off The fetters of fond dotage. From my sight Without reply, for I am apt to doe Something I may repent. O, who would place His happinesse in most accursed woman, In whom obsequiousnesse ingenders pride, And harshnesse deadly. From this howre I'le labour to forget there are such creatures; True friends be now my mistrisses. Cleere your browes, And though my heart-strings cracke for't, I will be To all, a free example of delight: We will haue sports of all kinds, and propound Rewards to such as can produce vs new. Vnsatisfiz'd though we surfeit in their store. And neuer thinke of curs'd Marcelia more. Ex.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quart. ScÃ¦. Prim. Enter Francisco, Graccho. Franc. And is it possible thou should'st forget A wrong of such a nature, and then studie My safetie and content? Grac. Sir, but allow me Only to haue read the elements of Courtship (Not the abstruce &amp; hidden acts to thriue there) And you may please to grant me so much knowledge, That iniuries from one in grace, like you, Are noble fauours. Is it not growne common In euerie sect, for those that want, to suffer From such as haue to giue? Your Captaine cast If poore, though not thought daring, but approu'd so To raise a coward into name, that's rich, Suffers disgraces publiquely, but receiues Rewards for them in priuate. Franc. Well obseru'd. Put on, we'le be familiar, and discourse A little of this argument. That day, In which it was first rumour'd, then confirm'd, Great Sforza thought me worthy of his fauor, I found my selfe to be another thing, Not what I was before. I passed then For a prittie fellow, and of prittie parts too, And was perhaps receiu'd so: but once rais'd, The liberall Courtier made me Master of Those vertues, which I ne're knew in my selfe. If I pretended to a iest, 'twas made one By their interpretation. If I offer'd To reason of Philosophy, though absurdly, They had helps to saue me, and without a blush Would sweare, that I by nature had more knowledge, Then others could acquire by any labor. Nay all I did indeed, which in another Was not remarkeable, in me shew'd rarely. Grac. But then they tasted of your bountie. Franc. True, They gaue me those good parts I was not borne too, And by my intercession they got that, Which (had I cross'd them) they durst not haue hop'd for. Grac. All this is Oracle. And shall I then, For a foolish whipping leaue to honour him, That holds the wheele of Fortune? No, that sauors Too much of th'antient freedome: Since great men Receiue disgraces, and giue thankes, poore knaues Must haue nor spleene, nor anger. Though I loue My limbes aswell as any man, if you had now A humor to kick me lame into an office, Where I might sit in State, and vndoe others, Stood I not bound to kisse the foot that did it? Though it seeme strange there haue been such things seene In the memorie of man. Franc. But to the purpose, And then, that seruice done, make thine owne fortunes. My wife, thou say'st, is iealous, I am too Familiar with the Dutches. Grac. And incens'd For her commitment in her brothers absence, And by her Mothers anger is spur'd on To make discouerie of it. This her purpose Was trusted to my charge, which I declin'd As much as in me lay, but finding her Determinately bent to vndertake it, Though breaking my faith to her may destroy My credit with your Lordship, I yet thought, Though at my peril, I stood bound to reueale it. Franc. I thanke thy care, and will deserue this secret, In making thee acquainted with a greater, And of more moment. Come into my bosome, And take it from me. Canst thou thinke, dull Graccho, My power, and honours, were confer'd vpon me, And ad to them this forme, to haue my pleasures Confin'd and limited? I delight in change, And sweet varietie, that's my heauen on earth, For which I loue life only. I confesse, My wife pleas'd me a day, the Dutches, two, (And yet I must not say, I haue enioy'd her) But now I care for neither. Therefore Graccho, So farre I am from stopping Mariana In making her complaint, that I desire thee To vrge her to it. Grac. That may proue your ruine, The Duke alreadie being, as 'tis reported, Doubtfull she hath play'd false. Franc. There thou art cosen'd, His dotage like an ague keeps his course, And now 'tis strongly on him. But I loose time, And therefore know, whether thou wilt or no, Thou art to be my instrument, and in spite Of the old sawe, that sayes, it is not safe On any termes to trust a man that's wrong'd, I dare thee to be false. Grac. This is a language My Lord, I vnderstand not. Franc. You thought, sirra, To put a trick on me for the relation Of what I knew before, and hauing woon Some weightie secret from me, in reuenge To play the traytor. Know thou wretched thing, By my command thou wert whip'd, &amp; euery day I'le haue thee freshly tortur'd, if thou misse In the lest charge that I impose vpon thee, Though what I speake, for the most part is true. Nay, grant thou had'st a thousand witnesses To be depos'd they heard it, 'tis in me With one word (such is Sforza's confidence Of my fidelitie not to be shaken) To make all void, and ruine my accusers. Therefore looke to't, bring my wife hotly on T'accuse me to the Duke (I haue an end in't) Or thinke, what 'tis makes man most miserable, And that shall fall vpon thee. Thou wert a foole To hope by being acquainted with my courses To curbe and awe me, or that I should liue Thy slaue, as thou did'st sawcily diuine. For prying in my councels, still liue mine. Exe. Franc. Grac. I am caught on both sides. This 'tis for a punie In Policies Protean Schoole, to try conclusions With one that hath commenc'd &amp; gon out doctor. If I discouer, what but now he bragg'd of, I shall not be beleeu'd. If I fall off From him, his threats and actions go togeither. And ther's no hope of safetie, till I get A plummet, that may sound his deepest counsels. I must obey and serue him. Want of skill Now makes me play the rogue against my will. Ex. Grac. ScÃ¦. Secund. Enter Marcelia, Tiberio, Stephano, Gentlewoman. Marc. Command me from his sight, &amp; with such scorne As he would rate his slaue. Tib. 'Twas in his furie. Steph. And he repents it Madame. Marc. Was I borne To'bserue his humors, or, because he dotes, Must I run mad? Tib. If that your Excellence Would please but to receiue a feeling knowledge Of what he suffers, and how deepe the least Vnkindnesse wounds from you, you would excuse His hastie language. Steph. He hath payed the forfeit Of his offence, I'me sure, with such a sorrow, As, if it had been greater, would deserue A full remission. Marc. Why, perhaps he hath it, And I stand more afflicted for his absence, Then he can be for mine? So pray you, tell him. But till I haue digested some sad thoughts, And reconcil'd passions that are at warre Within my selfe, I purpose to be priuate. And haue you care, vnlesse it be Francisco, That no man be admitted. Tib. How, Francisco! Steph. He, that at euerie stage keeps liuerie Mistresses, The stallion of the State! Tib. They are things aboue vs, And so no way concerne vs. Steph. If I were The Duke (I freely must confesse my weakenesse) I should weare yellow breeches. Here he comes. Ent. Frac. Tib. Nay spare your labour, Lady, we know our exit, And quit the roome. Steph. Is this her priuacie? Though with the hazard of a check, perhaps, This may goe to the Duke. Marc. Your face is full Of feares and doubts. The reason? Franc. O best Madam, They are not counterfeit. I your poore conuert, That only wish to liue in sad repentance, To mourne my desperate attempt of you, That haue no ends, nor aymes, but that your goodnesse Might be a witnesse of my penitence, Which seene would teach you, how to loue your mercie, Am robb'd of that last hope. The Duke, the Duke, I more then feare, hath found, that I am guiltie. Marc. By my vnspotted honor, not from me, Nor haue I with him chang'd one sillable Since his returne, but what you heard. Franc. Yet, malice Is Eagle-ey'd, and would see that which is not. And Iealousie's too apt to build vpon Vnsure foundations. Marc. Iealousie? Franc. It takes. Marc. Who dares but only thinke, I can be tainted? But for him, though almost on certaine proofe, To giue it hearing, not beleefe, deserues My hate for euer. Franc. Whether grounded on Your noble, yet chast fauors showne vnto me, Or her imprisonment, for her contempt To you, by my command, my frantique wife Hath put it in his head. Marc. Haue I then liu'd So long, now to be doubted? Are my fauors The theames of her discourse? Or what I doe, That neuer trode in a suspected path, Subiect to base construction? Be vndanted, For now, as of a creature that is mine, I rise vp your protrectesse. All the grace I hither to haue done you, was bestowed With a shut hand. It shall be now more free, Open, and liberall. But let it not, Though counterfeited to the life, teach you To nourish sawcie hopes. Franc. May I be blasted When I proue such a monster. Marc. I will stand, then, Betweene you, and all danger. He shall know, Suspition o're-turnes, what confidence builds, And he that dares but doubt, when ther's no ground, Is neither to himselfe, nor others sound. Ex. Marc. Franc. So, let it worke, her goodnesse, that deny'd, My seruice branded with the name of Lust, Shall now destroy it selfe. And she shall finde, When he's a sutor, that brings Cunning arm'd With power to be his aduocates, the denyall Is a disease as killing as the plague, And chastitie a clew, that leads to death. Hold but thy nature, Duke, and be but rash, And violent enough, and then at leasure Repent. I care not. And let my plots produce this long'd-for birth, In my reuenge I haue my heauen on earth. Ex. Franc. ScÃ¦. Tert. Enter Sforza, Pescara, three Gentlemen. Pesc. You promis'd to be merrie. 1. Gentlem. There are pleasures And of all kinds to entertaine the time. 2. Gentlem. Your excellence vouchsafing to make choice Of that, which best affects you. Sf. Hold your prating. Learne manners too, you are rude. 3. Gentlem. I haue my answere, Before I aske the question. Pesc. I must borrow The priuiledge of a friend, and will, or else I am, like these, a seruant, or what's worse, A parasite to the sorrow, Sforza worships In spite of reason. Sf. Pray you vse your freedome, And so farre, if you please, allow me mine, To heare you only, not to be compel'd To take your morall potions. I am a man, And thogh philosophy your mistrisse rage for't, Now I haue cause to grieue, I must be sad, And I dare shew it. Pesc. Would it were bestow'd Vpon a worthier subiect. Sf. Take heed, friend. You rub a sore, whose paine will make me mad, And I shall then forget my selfe and you. Lance it no further. Pesc. Haue you stood the shock Of thousand enemies, and out-fac'd the anger Of a great Emperor, that vowed your ruine, Though by a desperate, a glorious way, That had no president? Are you return'd with honor, Lou'd by your subiects? Does your fortune court you, Or rather say, your courage does command it? Haue you giu'n proofe to this houre of your life, Prosperitie (that searches the best temper) Could neuer puffe you vp, nor aduerse fate Deiect your valor? Shall I say, these vertues, So many and so various trials of Your constant mind, be buried in the frowne (To please you I will say so) of a faire woman? Yet I haue seene her equals. Sf. Good Pescara, This language in another were prophane, In you it is vnmannerly. Her equall? I tell you as a friend, and tell you plainly (To all men else, my Sword should make reply) Her goodnesse does disdaine comparison, And but her selfe admits no paralell. But you will say she's crosse, 'tis fit she should be When I am foolish, for she's wise, Pescara, And knows how farre she may dispose her bounties, Her honour safe: or if she were auerse, 'Twas a preuention of a greater sinne Readie to fall vpon me, for she's not ignorant But truly vnderstands how much I loue her, And that her rare parts doe deserue all honour, Her excellence increasing with her yeeres to, I might haue falne into Idolatry, And from the admiration of her worth, Bin taught to think there is no power aboue her, And yet I doe beleeue, had Angels sexes, The most would be such women, and assume No other shape, when they were to appeare In their full glorie. Pesc. Well Sir, I'le not crosse you, Nor labour to diminish your esteeme Hereafter of her, since your happinesse (As you will haue it) has alone dependance Vpon her fauour, from my Soule, I wish you A faire attonement. Sf. Time, and my submission Ent. Tib. &amp; Steph. May worke her to it. O! you are well return'd, Say, am I blest? hath she vouchsaf'd to heare you? Is there hope left that she may be appeas'd? Let her propound, and gladly I'le subscribe To her conditions. Tib. She Sir, yet is froward, And desires respite, and some priuacie. Step. She was harsh at first, but ere we parted, seem'd not Implacable. Sf. Ther's comfort yet, I'le ply her Each houre with new Embassadors of more honors, Titles, and eminence. My second selfe Francisco, shall sollicit her. Steph. That a wise man, And what is more, a Prince, that may command, Should sue thus poorely, and treat with his wife, As she were a victorious enemie, At whose proud feet, himselfe, his State, and Countrey, Basely beg'd mercie. Sf. What is that you mutter? I'le haue thy thoughts. Steph. You shall, you are too fond, And feed a pride that's swolne too bigge alreadie, And surfeits with obseruance. Sf. O my patience! My vassall speake thus? Steph. Let my head answere it If I offend. She that you thinke a Saint, I feare may play the Diuel. Pesc. Well said old fellow. Steph. And he that hath so long ingross'd your fauours, Though to be nam'd with reuerence, Lord Francisco, Who as you purpose, shall sollicite for you, I think's too neere her. Pesc. Hold Sir, this is madnesse. Steph. It may be they conferre of winning Lordships, I'me sure he's priuate with her. Sf. Let me goe, I scorne to touch him, he deserues my pittie, And not my anger, dotard, and to be one Is thy protection, els thou durst not thinke That loue to my Marcella hath left roome In my full heart for any Iealous thought, That idle passion dwell with thick-skind Trades-men, The vndeseruing Lord, or the vnable, Lock vp thy owne wife foole, that must take physicke From her young Doctor, phisicque vpon her backe Because thou hast the palsey in that part That makes her actiue, I could smile to thinke What wretched things they are that dare be iealous, Were I match'd to another Messaline, While I sound merit in my selfe to please her: I should beleeue her chast, and would not seeke To find out my owne torment, but alas, Inioying one that but to me's a Dion, I'me too secure. Tib. This is a confidence Ent. Grac. Isab. Mar. Beyond example. Grac. There he is, now speake, Or be for euer silent. Sf. If you come To bring me comfort, say, that you haue made My peace with my Marcelia. Isab. I had rather Waite on you to your funerall. Sf. You are my mother, Or by her life you were dead else. Mar. Would you were, To your dishonor, and since dotage makes you Wilfully blind, borrow of me my eyes, Or some part of my spirit. Are you all flesh? A limbe of patience only? No fire in you? But doe your pleasure, here your Mother was Committed by your seruant (for I scorne To call him husband) and my selfe your sister, If that you dare remember such a name, Mew'd vp to make the way open and free For the Adultresse, I am vnwilling To say a part of Sforza. Sf. Take her head off, She hath blasphem'd, and by our Law must dye. Isab. Blasphem'd, for calling of a whore, a whore? Sf. O hell, what doe I suffer? Mar. Or is it treason For me that am a subiect, to endeuour To saue the honour of the Duke, and that He should not be a Wittall on record. For by posterie 'twill be beleeu'd As certainly as now it can be prou'd, Francisco the great Minion, that swayes all, To meet the chast embraces of the Dutches, Hath leap'd into her bed. Sf. Some proofe vile creature, Or thou hast spoke thy last. Mar. The publique fame, Their hourely priuate meetings, and euen now When vnder a pretence of griefe or anger, You are deny'd the ioyes due to a husband, And made a stranger to her, at all times The dore stands open to him. To a Dutchman This were enough, but to a right Italian, A hundred thousand witnesses. Isab. Would you haue vs To be her bawdes? Sf. O the mallice And enuie of base women, that with horror Knowing their owne defects and inward guilt, Dare lye, and sweare, and damne, for what's most false, To cast aspersions vpon one vntainted, Y'are in your natures deuils, and your ends Knowing your reputation sunke for euer, And not to be recouer'd, to haue all, Weare your blacke liuerie. Wretches, you haue rays'd A Monumentall trophy to her purenesse, In this your studied purpose to depraue her, And all the shot made by your foule detraction Falling vpon her sure-arm'd Innocence, Return's vpon your selues, and if my loue Could suffer an addition, I'me so farre From giuing credit to you, this would teach me More to admire &amp; serue her, you are not worthy To fall as sacrifices to appease her, And therefore liue till your own enuy burst you. Isab. All is in vaine, he is not to be mou'd. Mar. She has bewitcht him. Pesc. 'Tis so past beliefe, To me it shewes a fable. Ent. Franc. &amp; a seruant. Franc. On thy life Prouide my horses, and without the Port With care attend me. Seru. I shall my Lord. Ex. seru. Grac. He's come. What Ã¼mmercracke haue we next? Franc. Great Sir. Sf. Francisco, Though all the ioyes in woman are fled from me In thee I doe embrace the full delight That I can hope from man. Franc. I would impart, Please you to lend your eare, a waightie secret, I am in labour to deliuer to you. Sf. All leaue the roome, excuse me good Pesc. Ere long I will waite on you. Pesc. You speake Sir The language I should vse. Sf. Be within call, Perhaps we may haue vse of you. Tib. We shall Sir. Sf. Say on my comfort. Franc. Comfort? No, your torment, For so my fate appoints me, I could curse The houre that gaue me being. Sf. What new monsters Of miserie stand readie to deuoure me? Let them at once dispatch me. Franc. Draw your sword then, And as you wish your own peace, quickly kil me, Consider not, but doe it. Sf. Art thou mad? Franc. Or if to take my life be too much mercy, As death indeed concludes all human sorrowes, Cut off my nose and eares, pull out an eye, The other only left to lend me light To see my owne deformities: Why was I borne Without some mulct impos'd on me by nature? Would from my youth a lothsome leprosie Had runne vpon this face, or that my breath Had been infectious, and so made me shun'd Of all societies: curs'd be he that taught me Discource or manners, or lent any grace That makes the owner pleasing in the eye Of wanton women, since those parts which others Value as blessings, are to me afflictions, Such my condition is. Sf. I am on the racke, Dissolue this doubtfull riddle. Franc. That I alone Of all mankind that stand most bound to loue you, And studie your content should be appointed, Not by my will, but forc'd by cruell fate To be your greatest enemie, not to hold you In this amazement longer, in a word, Your Dutches loues me. Sf. Loues thee? Franc. Is mad for me, Pursues me hourely. Sf. Oh! Franc. And from hence grew Her late neglect of you. Sf. O women! women! Franc. I labour'd, to diuert her by perswasion, Then vrg'd your much loue to her, &amp; the danger, Denyd her, and with scorne. Sf. 'Twas like thy selfe. Franc. But when I saw her smile, then heard her say, Your loue and extreme dotage as a Cloke Should couer our embraces, and your power Fright others from suspition, and all fauours That should preserue her in her innocence, By lust inuerted to be vs'd as bawdes, I could not but in dutie (though I know That the relation kils in you all hope Of peace hereafter, and in me 'twill shew Both base and poore to rise vp her accuser) Freely discouer it. Sf. Eternall plagues Pursue and ouertake her, for her sake To all posteritie may he proue a Cuckold, And like to me a thing so miserable As words may not expresse him, that giues trust To all deceiuing women, or since it is The will of Heauen to preserue mankind, That we must know, &amp; couple with these serpents, No wiseman euer taught by my example Hereafter vse his wife with more respect Then he would doe his Horse that do's him seruice, Base woman being in her creation made A slaue to man, but like a village nurse Stand I now cursing, and considering when The tamest foole would doe? Within there, Stephano, Tiberio, and the rest, I will be suddaine, And she shall know and feele loue in extreames, Abus'd knowes no degree in hate. Ent. Tib. Step. Guard Tib. My Lord. Sf. Goe to the Chamber of that wicked woman. Steph. What wicked woman, Sir? Sf. The deuill my wife. Force a rude entry, and if she refuse To follow you, drag her hither by the hayre And know no pittie, any gentle vsage To her will call on cruelty from me To such as shew it, Stand you staring! Goe, And put my will in act. Steph. Ther's no disputing. Tib. But 'tis a tempest on the suddaine rays'd, Who durst haue dreamt of? Ex. Tib. Steph. Sf. Nay, since she dares damnation, I'le be a furie to her. Franc. Yet great Sir, Exceed not in your furie, she's yet guiltie Only in her intent. Sf. Intent Francisco? It does include all fact, and I might sooner Be won to pardon treason to my Crowne, Or one that kil'd my Father. Franc. You are wise, And know what's best to doe, yet if you please To proue her temper to the height, say only That I am dead, and then obserue how farre She'le be transported. I'le remoue a little, But be within your call: now to the vpshot, How e're I'le shift for one. Ex. Franc. Enter Tiberio, Stephano, Marcelia, Guard. Marc. Where is this Monster? This walking tree of Iealousie, this dreamer, This horned beast that would be? O are you here Sir? Is it by your commandement or allowance, I am thus basely vs'd? Which of my vertues, My labours, seruices, and cares to please you (For to a man suspitious and vnthankefull, Without a blush I may be mine owne trumpet) Inuites this barbarous course? Dare you looke on me Without a seale of shame? Sf. Impudence, How vgly thou appear'st now? Thy intent To be a whore, leaues thee not blood enough To make an honest blush, what had the act done? Marc. Return'd thee the dishonor thou deseruest Though willingly I had giuen vp my selfe To euerie common letcher. Sf. Your chiefe minion, Your chosen fauourite, your woo'd Francisco, Has deerely pay'd for't, for wretch, know he's dead, And by my hand. Marc. The bloodyer villaine thou, But 'tis not to be wonder'd at, thy loue Do's know no other obiect, thou hast kil'd then A man I doe professe I lou'd, a man For whom a thousand Queenes might well be riuals, But he (I speake it to thy teeth) that dares be A Iealous foole, dares be a murtherer, And knowes no end in mischiefe. Sf. I begin now stabs her. In this my Iustice. Marc. Oh, I haue fool'd my selfe Into my graue, and only grieue for that Which when you know, you haue slaine an Innocent You needs must suffer. Sf. An Innocent? Let one Call in Francisco, for he liues (vile creature) Ex. Steph. To iustifie thy falshood, and how often With whorish flatteries thou hast tempted him, I being only fit to liue a stale, A bawd and propertie to your wantonnesse. Ent. Steph. Steph. Signior Francisco Sir, but euen now Tooke horse without the Ports. Marc. We are both abus'd, And both by him vndone, stay death a little Till I haue cleer'd me to my Lord, and then I willingly obey thee. O my Sforza, Francisco was not tempted, but the Tempter, And as he thought to win me shew'd the warrant That you sign'd for my death. Sf. Then I beleeue thee, Beleeue thee innocent too. Marc. But being contemn'd, Vpon his knees with teares he did beseech me Not to reueale it, I soft-hearted foole Iudging his penitence true, was won vnto it. Indeed the vnkindnesse to be sentenc'd by you Before that I was guiltie in a thought, Made me put on a seeming anger towards you, And now behold the issue, as I do, May heauen forgiue you. dyes. Tib. Her sweet soule has left Her beauteous prison. Steph. Looke to the Duke, he stands As if he wanted motion. Tib. Griefe hath stopt The organ of his speech. Steph. Take vp this body And call for his Physitians. Sf. O my heart-strings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quint. ScÃ¦. Prim. Enter Francisco, Eugenia. Franc. Why could'st thou thinke Eugenia that rewards, Graces, or fauours though strew'd thick vpon me Could euer bribe me to forget mine honour? Or that I tamely would sit downe, before I had dry'd these eyes still wet with showers of teares By the fire of my reuenge? Looke vp my deerest For that proud-faire that thiefe-like step'd betweene Thy promis'd hopes, and rob'd thee of a fortune Almost in thy possession, hath found With horrid proofe, his loue she thought her glorie And assurance of all happinesse, But hast'ned her sad ruine. Eug. Doe not flatter A griefe that is beneath it, for how euer The credulous Duke to me proued false &amp; cruel, It is imposible he could be wrought To looke on her, but with the eyes of dotage, And so to serue her. Franc. Such indeed I grant The streame of his affection was, and ran A constant course, till I with cunning malice (And yet I wrong my act, for it was Iustice) Made it turne back-wards, and hate in extreames Loue banish'd from his heart to fill the roome, In a word, know the faire Marcelia's dead. Eug. Dead! Franc. And by Sforza's hand, do's it not moue you? How coldly you receiue it? I expected The meere relation of so great a blessing Borne proudly on the wings of sweet reuenge Would haue cal'd on a sacrifice of thankes, And ioy not to be bounded or conceal'd! You entertaine it with a looke, as if You wish'd it were vndone! Eug. Indeed I doe, For if my sorrowes could receiue addition, Her sad fate would encrease, not lessen 'em. She neuer iniur'd me, but entertain'd A fortune humbly offer'd to her hand, Which a wise Lady gladly would haue kneel'd for. Vnlesse you would impute it as a crime, She was more faire then I, and had discretion Not to deliuer vp her virgin fort (Though straight besieg'd with flatteries, vowes, &amp; teares) Vntill the Church had made it safe &amp; lawfull. And had I been the mistris of her iudgement And constant temper, skilfull in the knowledge Of mans malitious falshood, I had neuer Vpon his hell-deepe oathes to marrie me, Giuen vp my faire name, and my mayden honor To his foule lust, nor liu'd now being branded In the forhead for his whore the scorne &amp; shame Of all good women. Franc. Haue you then no gall, Anger, or spleene familiar to your sexe? Or is it possible that you could see Another to possesse what was your due, And not growe pale with enuie? Eug. Yes of him That did deceiue me. Ther's no passion that A maid so iniur'd euer could partake of But I haue deerely suffer'd. These three yeeres In my desire, and labour of reuenge, Trusted to you, I haue indur'd the throes Of teeming women, and will hazard all Fate can inflict on me but I will reache Thy heart false Sforza. You haue trifled with me And not proceeded with that fiery zeale I look'd for from a brother of your spirit. Sorrow forsake me, and all signes of griefe Farewell for euer; Vengeance arm'd with furie Possesse me wholy now. Franc. The reason sister Of this strange metamorphosis? Eug. Aske thy feares, Thy base vnmanly feares, thy poore delayes, Thy dull forgetfulnesse equal with death, My wrong else, and the scandall which can neuer Be wash'd off from our house but in his blood, Would haue stirr'd vp a coward to a deed In which, though he had falne, the braue intent Had crown'd it selfe with a faire monument Of noble resolution. In this shape I hope to get accesse, and then with shame Hearing my sodaine execution, iudge What honor thou hast lost in being transcended By a weake woman. Franc. Still mine owne, and dearer, And yet in this you but poure oyle on fire, And offer your assistance where it needs not, And that you may perceiue I lay not fallow, But had your wrongs stamp'd deeply on my hart By the Yron pen of vengeance, I attempted By whoring her to cuckold him, that failing I did begin his tragedie in her death, To which it seru'd as Prologue, and will make A memorable storie of your fortunes In my assur'd reuenge, only best sister Let vs not loose our selues in the performance, By your rash vndertaking, we will be As suddaine as you could wish. Eug. Vpon those termes I yeeld my selfe and cause to be dispos'd of As you thinke fit. Ent. seruant Franc. Thy purpose? Serv. Ther's one Graccho That follow'd you it seemes vpon the tract, Since you left Millaine, that's importunate To haue accesse, and will not be deni'd, His hast he saies concernes you. Franc. Bring him to me, Ex. seruant Though he hath lay'd an ambush for my life, Or apprehension, yet I will preuent him And worke mine own ends out. Ent. Grac. Grac. Now for my whipping, And if I now out-strip him not, and catch him, And by a new and strange way to, hereafter I'le sweare there are wormes in my braines. Franc. Now my good Graccho, We meet as 'twere by miracle! Grac. Loue, and dutie, And vigilance in me for my Lords safetie, First taught me to imagine you were here, And then to follow you. Al's come forth my Lord That you could wish conceal'd. The Dutchesse wound In the Dukes rage put home, yet gaue her leaue To acquaint him with your practises, which your flight Did easily confirme. Franc. This I expected, But sure you come prouided of good counsaile To helpe in my extreames. Grac. I would not hurt you. Franc. How? hurt me? Such another word's thy death, Why dar'st thou thinke it can fall in thy will, T'outliue what I determine? Grac. How he awes me? Franc. Be briefe, what brought thee hither? Grac. Care to informe you, You are a condemn'd man, pursu'd, and sought for, And your head rated at ten thousand Ducates To him that brings it. Franc. Very good. Grac. All passages Are intercepted, and choyce troopes of horse Scoure o're the neighbour plaines, your picture sent To euerie State confederate with Millaine. That though I grieue to speake it, in my iudgement So thicke your dangers meet, and run vpon you, It is impossible you should escape Their curious search. Eug. Why let vs then turne Romanes, And falling by our owne hands, mocke their threats, And dreadfull preparations. Franc. 'Twould show nobly, But that the honour of our full reuenge Were lost in the rash action: No Eugenia, Graccho is wise, my friend to, not my seruant, And I dare trust him with my latest secret. We would (and thou must helpe vs to performe it) First kill the Duke, then fall what can vpon vs, For iniuries are writ in brasse, kind Graccho, And not to be forgotten. Grac. He instructs me What I should doe. Franc. What's that? Grac. I labour with A strong desire t'assist you with my seruice, And now I am deliuer'd of't. Franc. I tould you. Speake my oraculous Graccho, Grac. I haue heard Sir Of men in debt, that layd for by their creditors (In all such places where it could be thought They would take shelter) chose for sanctuarie, Their lodgings vnderneath their creditors noses, Or neere that prison to which they were design'd If apprehended, confident that there They neuer should be sought for. Eug. 'Tis a strange one! Franc. But what inferre you from it? Grac. This my Lord, That since all wayes of your escape are stop'd, In Millaine only, or what's more, i'the Court (Whether it is presum'd you dare not come) Conceal'd in some disguise you may liue safe. Franc. And not to be discouered? Grac. But by my selfe. Franc. By thee? Alas I know thee honest Graccho, And I will put thy counsell into act, And suddainly. Yet not to be vngratefull For all thy louing trauell to preserue me, What bloody end soe're my starres appoint, Thou shalt be safe good Graccho. Who's within there? Grac. In the deuils name what meanes he? Ent. seruants; Franc. Take my friend Into your custodie, and bind him fast, I would not part with him. Grac. My good Lord. Franc. Dispatch, 'Tis for your good to keepe you honest Graccho. I would not haue ten thousand Ducates tempt you (Being of a soft and waxe like disposition) To play the traytor, nor a foolish itch To be reueng'd for your late excellent whipping Giue you the opportunitie to offer My head for satisfaction. Why thou foole, I can looke through, &amp; through thee, thy intents Appeare to me as written in thy forhead In plaine and easie caracters. And but that I scorne a slaues base blood shold rust that sword That from a Prince expects a scarlet dye, Thou now wert dead, but liue only to pray For good successe to crowne my vndertakings, And then at my returne perhaps I'le free thee Ex. seruants with Gracc. To make me further sport. Away with him, I will not heare a sillable. We must trust Our selues Eugenia, and though we make vse of The counsaile of our seruants, that oyle spent, Like snuffes that doe offend we tread them out. But now to our last Scene, which we'le so carry, That few shall vnderstand how 'twas begun, Till all with halfe an eye may see 'tis don. Exeunt ScÃ¦. Secund. Enter Pescara, Tiberio, Stephano. Pesc. The like was neuer read of. Steph. In my iudgement To all that shall but heare it, 'twill appeare A most impossible fable. Tib. For Francisco, My wonder is the lesse because there are Too many Presidents of vnthankefull men Rays'd vp to greatnesse, which haue after studied The ruine of their makers. Steph. But that melancholy, Though ending in distraction, should worke So farre vpon a man as to compell him To court a thing that has nor sence, nor being, Is vnto me a miracle. Pesc. 'Troth I'le tell you, And briefly as I can, by what degrees He fell into this madnesse, When by the care Of his Physitians he was brought to life, As he had only pass'd a fearefull dreame, And had not acted what I grieue to thinke on, He call'd for faire Marcelia, and being told That she was dead, he broke forth in extreames, (I would not say blasphem'd) &amp; cri'd that heauen For all th'offences that mankind could doe, Would neuer be so cruell as to rob it Of so much sweetnesse, &amp; of so much goodnesse, That not alone was sacred in her selfe, But did preserue all others innocent That had but conuerse with her: Then it came Into his fancie that she was accus'd By his mother &amp; his sister, thrice he curs'd 'em, And thrice his desperat hand was on his sword To haue killd 'em both, but he restrayn'd, &amp; they Shunning his furie, spite of all preuention He would haue turn'd his rage vpon himselfe, When wisely his Physitians looking on The Dutches wound, to stay his readie hand, Cry'd out it was not mortall. Tib. 'Twas well thought on. Pesc. He easily beleeuing what he wish'd, More then a perpetuitie of pleasure In any obiect else, flatter'd by hope Forgetting his owne greatnesse, he fell prostrate At the doctors feet, implor'd their ayd, &amp; swore, Prouided they recouer'd her, he would liue A priuat man, &amp; they should share his dukedom. They seem'd to promise faire, and euerie houre Varie their iudgements as they find his fit To suffer intermission, or extreames. For his behauiour since Sf. As you haue pitty Within. Support her gently. Pesc. Now be your owne witnesses, I am preuented. Enter Sforza, Isab. Mari. the body of Marc. Doctors, Seruants. Sf. Carefully I beseech you, The gentlest touch torments her, &amp; then thinke What I shall suffer. O you earthy gods, You second natures, that from your great master (Who ioyn'd the limbes of torne Hyppolytus, And drew vpon himselfe the Thunderers enuie) Are taught those hidden secrets that restore To life death wounded men, You haue a patient On whom to'xpresse the excellence of art, Will bind e'ne heau'n your debtor, though It pleases To make your hands the organs of a worke The saints will smile to looke on, &amp; good Angels Clap their Celestiall wings to giue it plaudits. How pale and wan she lookes? O pardon me, That I presume dyde o're with bloody guilt, Which makes me I confesse, far, far vnworthy To touch this snow-white hand. How cold it is? This once was Cupids fire-brand, and still 'Tis so to me. How slow her pulses beat to? Yet in this temper she is all perfection, And Mistris of a heat so full of sweetnesse, The blood of virgins in their pride of youth Are balles of Snow or Ice compar'd vnto her. Mar. Is not this strange? Isab. O crosse him not deere daughter, Our conscience tells vs we haue been abus'd, Wrought to accuse the innocent, and with him Are guiltie of a factâ! Ent. a seruant Mar. 'Tis now past helpe. Pesc. With me? What is he? Ser. He has a strange aspect, A Iew by birth, and a Physitian By his profession as he sayes, who hearing Of the Dukes phrensie, on the forfeit of His life will vndertake to render him Perfect in euery part. Prouided that Your Lordships fauour gaine him free accesse, And your power with the Duke a safe protection, Till' the great worke be ended. Pesc. Bring me to him, As I find cause I'le doe. Exe. Pesc. &amp; Ser. Sfor. How sound she sleepes! Heauen keepe her from a lethergie; how long (But answere me with comfort I beseech you.) Do's your sure iudgement tell you that these lids That couer richer iewells then themselues Li'ke enuious night will barre these glorious sunnes From shining on me? 1. Doct. We haue giuen her Sir, A sleepy potion that will hold her long, That she may be lesse sensible of the torment, The searching of her wound will put her to. 2. Doct. Shee now feeles litle, but if we should make her, To heare her speake would fright both vs and you, And therefore dare not hasten it. Sf. I am patient, You see I doe not rage, but waite your pleasure. What doe you thinke she dreames of now? for sure Although her bodies organs are bound fast, Her fancy cannot slumber. 1. Doct. That Sir, lookes on Your sorrow for your late rash art with pitty Of what you suffer for it, and prepares To meet with free confession of your guilt With a glad pardon. Forza. Shee was euer kind And her displeasure though call'd on, short liu'de Vpon the least submission. O you powers That can conuey our thoughts to one another Without the end of eies, or eares, assist me, Let her behold me in a pleasing dreame, Thus on my knees before her (yet that duty In me is not sufficient) let her see me Compell my mother (from whom I looke life) And this my sister, Partner of my being, To bow thus low vnto her, let her heare vs In my acknowledgement freely confesse That we in a degree as high are guilty, As she is innocent; bite your tongues, vile creatures, And let your inward horror fright your soules For hauing belide that purenesse, to come neere which All women that posterity can bring forth Must be, though striuing to be good, poore Riualls. And for that dog Francisco (that seduc'd me In wounding her to raise a temple built To Chastitie and sweetnesse) let her know I'll follow him to hell, but I will find him, And there liue a fourth fury to torment him. Then for this cursed hand and arme that guided The wicked steele, I'll haue them ioynt by ioynt, With burning irons seard of, which I will eate. I being a vultur fit to tast such carrion, Lastly. 1. Doct. You are too lowd, Sir, you disturbe Her sweet repose. Forza. I am hush'd, yet giue vs leaue Thus prostrate at her feet, our eies bent downewards, Vnworthy, and asham'd to looke vpon her, T' expect her gracious sentence. 2. Doct. Hee's past hope. 1. Doct. The body to, will putrifie, and then We can no longer couer the imposture. Tibe. Which in his death will quickly be discouer'd I can but weepe his fortune. Steph. Yet be carefull, You loose no minute to preserue him, time, May lessen his distraction. Franc. I am no God Sir. Ent. Pesca. Fran. Eugen. To giue a new life to her, yet I'le hazard My head, I'le worke the sencelesse trunke t' appeare To him as it had got a second being, Or that the soule that's fled from't were call'd backe, To gouerne it againe, I will preserue it In the first sweetnesse, and by a strange vaper Which I'le infuse into her mouth, create A seeming breath, I'le make her vaines run high to As if they had true motion. Pesc. Doe but this, Till we vse meanes to win vpon his passions T' indure to heare shee's dead with some small patience And make thy owne reward. Franc. The art I vse Admits no looker on, I only aske The fourth part of an hower to perfect that I boldly vndertake. Pesc. I will procure it. 2. Doct. What stranger's this? Pesc. Sooth me in all I say There is a maine end in't. Frans. Beware. Euge. I am warn'd. Pesc. Looke vp Sir chearefully, comfort in me Flowes stronglie to you. Forza. From whence came that sound? Was it from my Marcelia? if it were I rise and ioy will giue me wings to meet it. Pes. Nor shall your expectation be deferrd But a few minuts, your Physitians are Meere voice, and no performance, I haue found A man that can do wonders, do not hinder The Dutches wisht recouery to inquire, Or what he is, or to giue thankes, but leaue him To worke this miracle. Sf. Sure, 'tis my good Angell, I do obey in all things; be it death For any to disturbe him, or come neere Till he be pleasd' to call vs, Ã´ be prosperous And make a Duke thy Bondman. Exe. all but Franc. &amp; Eugenia. Franc. Tis my pupose If that to fall a long wisht sacrifice To my reuenge can be a benefit. I'll first make fast the dores, soe. Euge. You amaze me What followes now? Franc. A full conclusion Of all thy wishes, looke on this Eugenia, Eu'n such a thing, the proudest faire on earth (For whose delight the elements are ransack'd And art with nature studies to preserue her) Must be when she is summond to appeare In the Court of death, but I loose time. Euge. What meane you? Franc. Disturbe me not, your Ladiship lookes pale But I, your Docter, haue a ceruse for you, See my Eugenia, how many faces That are ador'd in Court borrow these helpes, And passe for excellence, when the bettet part Of them are like to this, your mouth smells soure to, But here is that shall take away the sent, A precious antidote old Ladies vse When they would kisse, knowing their gummes are rotten: These hands to, that disdaind' to take a touch From any lip, whose honour writ not Lord Are now but as the coursest earth, but I Am at the charge, my bill not to be paid to To giue them seeming beauty, soe tis done How do you like my workmanship? Eugen. I tremble And thus to tirannize vpon the dead Is most inhumane. Franc. Come we for reuenge, And can we thinke on pitty? now to the vpshott, And as it proues applaud it. My lord the Duke Enter with ioy, and see the suddaine chance Your seruants hand hath wrought. Ent. Forza and the rest. Forza I liue againe In my full confidence that Marcelia may Pronounce my pardon. Can she speake yet? Franc. No, You must not looke for all your ioyes at once, That will aske longer time. Pesca. Tis wondrous strange! Forza. By all the dues of loue I haue had from her, This hand seemes as it was when first I kist it, These lips inuite to, I could euer feed Vpon these roses, they still keepe their colour And natiue sweetnesse, only the nectar's wanting That like the morning dew in flowry May Preseru'd them in their beauty. Enter Graccho Grac. Treason, treason. Tiber. Call vp the guard. Franc. Graccho! then we are lost. Gracc. I am got off, Sir Iew, a bribe hath done it For all your serious charge; ther's no disguise can keepe You from my knowledge, Forza. Speake. Gracc. I am out of breath, But this is. Franc. Spare thy labor foole, Francisco. All. Monster of Men. Franc. Giue me all attributes Of all you can imagine, yet I glory To be the thing I was borne, I am Francisco, Francisco that was rais'd by you, And made the Minion of the time The same Francisco, That would haue whor'd this trunke when it had life, And after breath'd a iealousie vpon thee As killing as those damps that belch out plagues, When the foundation of the earth is shaken; I made thee doe a deed heauen will not pardon Which was to kill an innocent. Forza. Call forth the tortures For all that flesh can feele. Franc. I dare the worst, Only to yeeld some reason to the world Why I pursud' this course, looke on this face Made old by thy base falshood, 'tis Eugenia. Forza. Eugenia. Franc. Do's it start you Sir? my Sister, Seduc'd and fool'd by thee, but thou must pay The forfet of thy falshod, do's it not worke yet? What ere becomes of me (which I esteeme not) Thou art mark'd for the graue, I haue giuen thee poison In this cup, now obserue me, with thy last Carowsing deeply of, made thee forget Thy vow'd, faith to Eugenia. Pesc. O damn'd villaine! Isab. How do you Sir? Forza. Like one, That learnes to know in death what punishment; Waites on the breath of faith, Ã´ now I feele An Ãtna in my entrailes, I haue liu'd A Prince, and my last breath shalbe commaund I burne, I burne, yet er'e life be consum'd Let me pronounce vpon this wretch all torture That witty cruelty can inuent. Pesc. Away with him. Tibe. In all things we will serue you. Franc. Farewell sister, Now I haue kept my word, torments I scorne, I leaue the world with glory, they are men And leaue behind them name and memory, That wrong'd doe right themselues before they die. Ste. A desperate wretch. Exe. guard with Franc. Forza. I come death, I obey thee, Yet I will not die raging, for alas, My whole life was a phrensie. Good Eugenia In death forgiue me, As you loue me beare her To some religious house, there let her spend The remnant of her life, when I am ashes Perhaps shee'll be appeas'd, and spare a prayer For my poore soule. Bury me with Marcelia And let our Epitaph beâ Tibe. His speech is stop'd. Steph. Already dead. Pesc. It is in vaine to labour To call him backe, wee'll giue him funerall, And then determine of the state affaires And learne from this example ther's no trust In a foundation that is built on lust.
